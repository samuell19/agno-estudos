Help! Help! What Will Become Of You? Book Director Shall I make you get a move on, Kanake? Hurry! - And the portemonnaie? - What portemonnaie? She put the money into her portemonnaie. I've seen it. - And where is it? - I don't have it! - I'll kill you! - I've taken nothing. He's hidden the dough and thrown away the portemonnaie. - Are you nuts? - Frisk him! I've got nothing! - Because I believe you. - No, really! Hush! Come on, get your kit off! The devil wants to trick us. Where did you hide the dough, Kanake? I've got nothing. The wife had another bag. You got fooled! You owe me a grand. He has the dough! Bet that he has the dough? Then get it! You rotten wog! Where's the dough? Fuck off! You probably don't come to school any more? - Get lost! - Hey man! - Come on, let him jerk off alone. - Kanake! I saw it first. Listen up! Drop the act, it's like always... So, what's going on here? Well? Is anything wrong? Why are you looking so grumpy? Are you mad? Sit! I said: Sit! Do you have to scream like that? Well, so for once you show up again? Or maybe you want to take off too? Are you hungry? The boy thinks only about food! He could at least greet us for once. But he's only on the take. Both of them are. They are quite good at that. Man, leave my kids alone. They aren't your concern. How much more do you want to take? Now just leave the clock. What's the matter? - I'm packing. - And? - I'm moving out. - Why? Just look at those two. Now she also wants money. Should I go on the game for the two? Not with me. Harald says I can settle in with him. - And I'm doing that now. - But he hasn't got a proper apartment. Oh, that's fine. She's going along with me for now. Before the old man pulls her into his lap. - Is it Willi? - I don't care about him. I'm not allowed to let you leave. You're still not 18. You only fear for the children's allowance. I tell you one thing: If you make trouble, I'll go to social services. Man, that's completely pointless. Come on! You can come and visit us. Roast potatoes: you do them well. Can I now have Veronica's room? I'm moving in there. Is that clear? Otto! Aha. Well?! There's an animal film on the box. I don't know. And at your place? - Nothing. - Ah, they're drinking again, huh? Well, come in. Piss off! Hey, look! What kind of colour is that? Hey, look at the pants over there. Cool! Hot! How much are they? - 8 marks. - Hey, you're crazy. That's right! I was wrong. They're 10 marks. She is indeed nuts. Well, okay. 9 - Well, You see! - Yes, okay. Shit! Always the same with the bins. As soon as they are emptied they're already full. And just bottles. - Who's bike is that? - I don't know. Just bottles! Well! Is that your bone spanner, or mine? Mine! It's OK. Say no more! It's yours. Are you perhaps Boris Schulz? So what? My name is Walter Henschke. I've taken your class. - And? - I wanted to call after you. I have to, if the students don't come. But nobody opens up. - Is your mother there? - Perhaps she's sleeping. - Well, you have a bike too? - No, but I'm building myself one. - Ah, and now you're short of a saddle? - Why? Say: Don't you fancy going to school again? Let's see. When your bike is ready, OK? Let's see. Well, I'll allow myself to be surprised. Boris! Don't talk so much. Get up here! Well, there must be some reason why you no longer go to school? You don't feel like it? Are you afraid of someone? How do you get along with the teachers? - Well, I have coffee to boot. - Ah, thank you! I'm sorry about before, but I was so tired. I'm up to my ears with work: a daughter, like I said. - Sugar? - Yes, Please! What will become of Kanake now, with his backward schooling? You think he at least gets to do refuse collecting? He won't. He's not strong enough. I wouldn't begrudge the boy anything, but... Say yourself... Well, Ms. Schulz, I don't know what will become of Boris, but do let him learn something first. By the way, Ms. Schulz, we have compulsory education. You have to send him to school. I have to do nothing. Since his father is dead, he has a guardian. He has to do it, not me. Don't get me wrong please, Ms. Schulz, but it could happen to you, that the boy gets brought to school by the police. The cops? Well, here goes! Please send some cops. They'll be amazed at how fast I'm gone. Terrific! Man, that's some feeling. Hey, the Kanake! What are you doing here? I can go wherever I want. You don't have to grumble like that. - Say: Do we have a new teacher? - You mean Henschke? And? He's... He's far out. Very hot stuff. You can really talk to him. As with people like us. He is from around here. Hey... don't you want to come to school again? - Don't know. What's going on here? You haven't been to bed? Give the dog his food! And me? Take a mark or two. Is it good? Why don't you open the shop? Oh, there's no business. There! The cops! He's also just a liar. They are slow too. The administrative channels. I tell you: he's just a liar too. Well, maybe it was just an act by him. Well, if they don't get me today, then I'll... I'll go to school. It may also be, they hadn't any time yet. Do you think it wasn't that important to them? Yes, that's possible too. Yes, yes, yes. Oh, you know: People are stupid. I now offer my coal and wood at summer prices, huh? Do you think anyone buys? Ha! No one buys. But in the winter they come and complain about the prices, and buy the briquettes piecemeal. Boy, oh boy! Shit, now I'm fed up. Do you have plans for the summer holidays? Yes, first I'm going to recover from my exam. Oh, the exam. It's purely a matter of routine. You'll do it hands down. Christ! You do know, that this nonsense is prohibited. If you start here, then you will remain here until you're old and grey. Well, it doesn't have to be like that. Why? Aren't you feeling at home here? Yes, of course I'm still not able to deal with every situation. Just hide it from the students. You think it's unreasonable? Any weakness you show will be taken advantage of by the students without any restraint. But it clearly depends on how one confronts the students. Not with them! The parents are work-shy. At home, there's no discipline. No order. You can't accustom them to regular lessons. I only meet aggression with these kids. And they don't have any awareness of reality. They all want to be racers or astronauts. They will end up before the social security office. - And you think it has to be that way? - There! That one! Take him for example. When he attends, he only makes trouble. Well, you'll see it. Do you know why he always skips? Because he has realized that this is not a school for astronauts, but a special school for learning difficulties. Excuse me a moment. - Well, Boris? - You wanted to frighten me, huh? What? Why? Yes... Well, the cops and stuff. A Pick up. Did you really think I'd let you get picked up by the cops? You have... You said it! Well, I said. But if you don't come voluntarily, what is the use? You said, you would run away again. - So what? - Well the main thing is you're here. What do you want here? Smell him, if he still stinks. Oh no! Kanake stinks of piss. Want to contaminate the whole class, or what? I'll bet he's wet his pants? Should I spank your ass, huh? Or should I pull down your pants again? Bastards! Stop it! Come on! Good morning! Morning. - Can't you even do a greeting? - Sit down! It's all Greek to Kanake. Perhaps you should try Turkish. Listen! Why do you call Boris, Kanake? Because he is called that. He's always been Kanake. And why? Well, because he's a wog. Well, what is a "Kanake"? - Listen: Stop it! - "Stop it" Stop the nonsense, yes? And you: Please put away that brush. So. What does Kanake mean? Shit. Pisser. Maybe Turk? It's stinker. And you find that funny? Boris comes from a Turk? Asshole! So... - We are all "Kanaken". - Boo! We are all "Kanaken". Kanake is a foreign word. The old sailors brought it from the Pacific Ocean. The natives of the Polynesian Islands, they call themselves "Kanaken". Well, what does that probably mean? - Is it Turk? - Ha, you joker, you! Kanake means human. It's simply: people. - Man? - Man, Kanake! Man, stinker! - Man, Pisser! - Man, Hasso! You've got nothing better? Or does it feel good, if you call someone pisser or stinker? - Does it do something for you? - Maybe. Then you must be in need of it quite a lot. You said it! He gets it with the dog whip at home. That true? That's nothing to you. And you think, if you hit too, then it'll work out, yes? - I spank when I want. - But not with me. Well, now get out! Right now. Get out! I have told you to go. Come on! - Let go of me! - Go ahead! - Let go! - Off you go! Well then! We started, the last time, to talk about the forest, and have found that there are two very different kinds of trees. - Deciduous trees. - Firs. - Palm trees. Please, not so muddled up like a mixed forest, right? So now everyone gets a worksheet first. Then you can list what comes to your mind about coniferous and deciduous forests. First of all, names in the top right of the sheet. - Do you have a pen, Boris? - No. Oh well. Come. Take mine. It doesn't matter. Well? Peace? Take it! Do you see the bike there? It's Henschke's. Cut through the tyre! I won't! - You will! - No way! You see? You've done it now. And I am a witness. Pig! Pig himself. Stinker! Pisser! Kanake! How do you spell spruce, Uncle Willi? Write fir: F I E R And pine? Think something up. - Do you have to do your prep now? - Just trying. Don't you notice that you bother me? Why don't you do it in the kitchen. Because the table is dirty. Then clean it! The boy has done nothing to you. Well clean the table yourself then! Shit! - Why do you always drink milk? - It dissolves the coal dust. - From that little bit of coal? - Well, in the past it was more. That's an awesome car! To have that much money. Damn it! And the guy looks dressy! Damn it! - Don't you have to go to school? - Nope! And why not? Doesn't work. Also, I have no time. - All right: Nine! - Yes, thank you. First edition! Fantastic! Well, what do you want? Bringing me stuff like that again. All good prices. Yes, but I must first get rid of them. And in exchange? Drop bars and a saddle. I don't have drop bars nor a saddle. - You can have a carry rack. - And? - And what? - Well, a brake too. Brake? Fair enough. For you a brake too. Come to dinner! Are you happy? - What? You want to travel? - Why do you think that? Well, because you have your car with you again. Oh! You never use the car in the city? Rarely. I live around here and bikes are cheaper. My parents do everything by car. Tell me: Have you seen Boris lately? If you drive us, I can show you where he is. But he wants to go on a trip. Well, I've got my long weekend. Get in all! - You won't get into trouble? - Well, if you don't squeal. - Where are we going? - Adelheid will guide us. Well, Hasso! Want to come? It is forbidden for teachers to take pupils in their car. Just look. You know so much. If you squeal, you'll get it. And what now? Now I am not your teacher - but in private. - So now what? - To the left! It's a pretty old car, huh? - Yes, pretty much! - It's an antique car. Got that? I think it's great. - Here he always chases his rats. - Rats? Yes, you'll have to have him show you. He uses a catapult. He is not here. Well, perhaps he's with his sister. Where do you want to go then, today? - To Braunschweig. - Do you have a girlfriend there? Say: You're a little nosey, huh? Just look at him: Our Mr. Henschke! Just look! You thought you had an opportunity, huh? What's up? Nothing at all. We just wanted to look after you. - What you're doing. - Why? Just like that. Don't get totally mad. We don't want to bother you. - That's a car! - Not bad. It's our teacher's. Fine, huh? And how do you get replacement parts? Yes, that's a problem. You have to look quite hard. - I can imagine. - I've already had parts rebuilt. - Expensive. - We'll take a look, huh? - And the mileage? - For that I could drive a bulldozer. - Who goes for a bulldozer? - You're right of course. And the engine is all right? Yes, spark plugs and carburettor are new. Air filter. Yes, it's still good. Only the compression is not right. You probably need new pistons and new piston rings. - Can you help me with this? - No, because I don't have the tools. But listen: I have a friend who can do it at a good price. We should talk sometime. - Excuse me. - OK Well, do you like it? - Did you build everything yourself? - No, not everything. Man, you must be more formal with Mr. Henschke. - Or we are all less formal. - Oh God, that's just what I needed! I have enough trouble in school. Say: And that's your bike, right? That's great. It's almost done. No, it still needs a lot. The saddle is missing. Brakes and light don't work properly. And a gear change, that's about it. And a steel chain, so they don't steal it. - I should go to school, huh? - Hmm, wouldn't be bad. Let's see. Have you heard about our class trip already? Before the summer holidays. I take my second state exam based on this class trip. Do you get grades too? Yes. What do you think? I'm still not an approved teacher. Do you get me? It would be great if you'll help me a bit. - Of course. - Of course. I don't like such tricks. Mr. Henschke! Didn't you know that it's forbidden to take students in a private car? - No, I didn't know. - You've also had this slut with you. Which slut, if you please? Well, Adelheid. I wouldn't be surprised if she's already on the game. But say, how come you think that? I've got eyes in my head. Have you seen it? My God! I haven't, of course, been following her. But maybe you, as a man, want to research the matter. Now that isn't possibly included in the school laws. Listen... If you want to prevail as a teacher here in the long run, then you have to distance yourself. - Yes, yes! - Believe me! I want the best for you. Not so fast over there! Come on, Kai, try again. You've got to jump with both feet together, right? And a little more courage! Well! Come on! And another time around. - I'll show you again. Watch for now. - Wimp! Take over from Hasso. Well come on, Boris! Not fair! You've helped. Not more than anyone else, though. But I can't stand it, when the stronger ones sneer at the weaker. I'm supposed to be weak? Me? I, weak! Well, Boris? Is your bike ready? And now? Now you don't know what to do, huh? May I? Like this. Great! Tell me: How do you do that? But you've practised a lot, huh? I did! Nearly every day! - Look at this bike! - What junk! Well, don't you manage, huh? Oh my, what a mess! From the rubbish? That's so bad! - I don't have a chain though. - You think someone would touch it? Wouldn't like anyone to steal it. Could someone hook it up with his? He wants me to hook up my good bike with this scrap thing. What does it do to your bike? You think it spoils it? Man, that's a lousy act! You could afford a racer. - From what? - From the dough you pinched. I have nothing. She put the dough into the other bag. You have to prove it. Get the other bag. I'm not taking part any longer. Well, I've brought all the paperwork for our class trip. First, the exact address. Then a list of all the things you have to take. Also, a parental consent. You have to get it signed. By the way, Ms. Winter and her class are going along. - Man! - Is that really necessary?! - The stupid chick! - Well, Boris! It can't be helped. After my second exam, I can have a say too. - Then we go after the exam. - Huh? What kind of exam? One more thing: You have to raise a cost share of 70 marks. - How much? - Too much! If you might not have the money, request it at the welfare office. Then you get the money. - Shit! - What is it? Read through everything again. I'd like to know if there are any questions. I can forget that journey. - Why? - My mother won't give the money. She should go to social services. - She won't. - Is she proud? Stop talking, okay? - Boris says he can't go. - Shut up! So, why can't you come along? His mother won't go to social services. She's too proud. Well, I'm going to talk to your mother. - No use! - Wait! So, now we'll have to work out an agenda. And a plan for the night. Right, Achim? Barf! Ugh! We have three minutes. If I had seventy marks, I would buy new cassettes. I wasn't out of town my whole life. - And? Did it hurt me? - But I want to go! - Don't you like it here no more? - Can't you try it? - Don't be a pain in the arse! - But I want to! Another thing lad: A bicycle does not belong in the flat. But I have no chains and no lock. Put it in the basement, then. I'm tired of the fuss with this shit bike. Well, Kanake, finally all put together? Saddle too? Yes. - Now you go racing, huh? - No, I want to sell it. - I need money. - What have you got in mind? - 70 marks. - Boy, you'll get a new one for that. If I offer it for 30, maybe it would go for 20. - Ten then? - Ah, no. I would like to withdraw 1000 marks. So, please sign here on the back. - There you go. - Thank you. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 1000 and your card. Thank you. You're getting up so early every time now? Is that necessary? - School? - Hmm. Take the garbage down before the bins fill up. (in the name of the law) You are crazy after all. What makes you think that? It is here. They throw us out. If we don't pay, we have to go to a shelter. - I don't think so. - He's talking Bollocks! Nobody throws us out of here. But the rent is not paid yet, huh? As long as I've lived here, I've taken the rent to the post office on time. Man, Willi! Every month I pressed the money into your hands. Yes, so I'll clarify that. Stop that snivelling. Get dressed and go to services with Kanake. No, I won't go. You know me, this is embarrassing. This drama every time. Just go. You'll make it. So now you want the money from us. Yes! Yes please. First I must give you some paperwork to fill. Oh, I've dislocated my arm this morning. I can't write. Can you be so kind. Let's do it. But read the form first. - When does it begin? - Pardon? - Well, the class trip. - In 6 weeks. Aha! Because it takes four weeks until it's done That's good enough. Excuse me, today I've had really bad luck. I can't find my reading glasses. I must have forgotten them. - Can't you read it for me? - Let's do it. - Your name? - Schulz, Roswita. That's really nice of you. Well? Are you proud of your mother? I'm in a hurry. Do you still want to go to school? Sure. Are there any schools for adults? Why? Well, I mean, don't you want to learn to read and write? I can read and write, squirt! Hey, Boris! Well, what's going on? Have you slept through? Why? You're late too. Well, I have the first two hours free. I was with my mother at services. - Because of the class trip. - And? - Well, I think it'll work out. - That's great! You're able to find the way in Kreuzberg now by consulting a map, aren't you? Now I have a map of Tiergarten for you. The other way round. Well, and you'll find out where we sit now. And then try to find the way to the restaurant. I have it marked here. But we don't know this place. Just look around first.. Perhaps you see something that's also on the map. - Man, hey! Can't you leave me alone? - I have something! There! The lady there. The Victory Column. And here... - There is the Victory Column. - Good! So, what do we do now? - Obviously: align the map to the north. - Why and where is north? Well, always on the top of the map, you slob. So, there is north? There is north? Or there is north? Who is the slob now you dope? North... is... there! - Why? - Well, the sun rises in the east. It's in the south at noon. Now it is 9. So there it is at twelve. No, now is summer time. So it's there at 11. So right there is north. I don't understand. Why doesn't the sun take that way? - Well, because it doesn't. - Excellent Karl-Heinz. You can do it that way if you don't have a compass. So... If north is here the Victory Column is there and the pub there, we are here. Because there is the pond, and it's right there on the map. Then we have to go that way. - To the Victory Column and then there. - Well, then get going. Kanake, admit it: You guessed all that. No, it's all on the map. I can show you. Man, you are a kissass, you know? There, there, and then there. No, but it's faster here. - I would go that way. - Yes, you can do that too. - You are indeed really good today. - I'm with Susanne. - Look at Kalle! He's nuts! - Drifts away and doesn't even notice. - He never realizes a thing! - Karl-Heinz, come back! Kalle is adrift. Kalle drowns. Come back! - But how? Can you tell me how? - Well, row! There are no oars on board! Kalle is all gone! Kalle is all gone! Sit down, Karl-Heinz. We'll get you on land again. I'll push you off. You did that on purpose! Mean teacher pig! Rotten brute! - You did it on purpose. - Take off your shirt. I saw what you planned: You wanted to topple him. You're off your rocker, old cunt. - Better than you, asshole. - Stop it. You wanted to save me, huh? Come on, come on, take off those jeans. Come on, we have to wring them out. Got crappy underwear? Take down your trousers. Well, come on! Come on! - Come, come, you stay here. - Old brute, he'll pay. He wanted to topple him. Now he's gone bathing himself. You stay out with your dirty feet. Come here! I've good news for you. The postman brought your money. - Give it to me! - No, no. I'll keep it for now. I have to take it to school. I'll do it myself. Why don't you give it to me? It's mine. No. But, I've done it! I'll bring it myself in the next few days. Oh well. - Hello. - Hello! Well, do come in. Stop! Not that way! On the right! Right there. So, sit down for now. I'll be back. Hey, make some space. Man, he owns lots of books. - Has he any porn? - Look yourself. Well, if he has any, he's hidden them. - Susanne? - Yes? - Can you help me please? - Yes. - Andreas, you too! - Yes. - Wow, wicked bed, huh? - Pretty much. It even fits two. - Are you looking for north again? - Hmm. - Why are you looking so strangely? - You like it here? No curtains on the windows. And also, he doesn't have a video. Well, want to share the bed with him? - Ha, ha, ha - Well, you like older men? - Nonsense. - Well, Karl-Heinz... Just push the table over there. What are you doing? Come sit down here. Here by the bed. You see! Then we have enough space. Great. Put it down for now. I think it's royally sweet that you've invited all of us. - Well, then tuck in! - Did you bake the cake? - No. - How many live here? Well, sometimes 4 or 5. - Your friend, too? - Man, she lives in Braunschweig. - How could I know? - Well! Now let's talk about our class trip. We live in a home. We have to cook ourselves. Now let's make a schedule. Or: Can any of you cook? And what do we want to cook? - Fried potatoes. - Chicken fricassee. - Fried potatoes with eggs is good. You, your Willi is gone! - What? - Your Willi bunked off. - Why? - What do I know. He's gone. The money! All gone! All gone! Then we'll get kicked out! He's also stolen your money, kid. Now all we have is twelve marks. And there is nothing to eat. We still have potatoes. That's enough. - The villain! The pig! - I've never liked him. Well, Boris. Why didn't you come? Not bent on doing something? Something happened? I rarely like to go to school in the morning too. Yes, I think sometimes school is shit. But I want to be a teacher, so I've got to get my exam. And for you it would be very good if you learned math and reading. Even if it is made hard for you. Here: I'm going too. That's great. Ah, boy, there you are. I was looking for you. Now listen: Take care of your mother, will you? Well, go, go, go, kid. Hurry up! One more closet then we call it a day. I don't understand this. I can't. You can believe me that I don't like it: To evict someone. But you've had more than half a year to put the matter right. I've known nothing at all. Now even a bailiff. My God! I couldn't imagine that the man is an impostor. Every month I gave him the rent and he embezzled it all. I don't want to go to a shelter. Well, supplies for mommy? She drinks like a priest, in an hour! Stop! We're not done yet, Kanake! You do have debts with me. - Go take off your shirt! - Come on! Didn't you hear? Strip off your clothes - or are you deaf? Shine my shoes! Tomorrow you pay your debts. Now the other. Okay, stand up. What else do you have in your pockets? Show your pockets! Show me your hand! No, the other one! What should I do with that? Next time I want to see more. Got that? I have it written that I own the TV and the recorder. They couldn't seize them because they're mine. No, it isn't so, madam. The bailiff didn't seize the equipment because it belongs to us. - I've bought them. - You have leased them. - Only leased. There's a difference. - What? I mean borrowed or loaned. Well, maybe you haven't read that properly. How is it? Do you want to pay the overdue instalments? I'm sorry. You are entitled to a black and white TV. By the way, we're able to offer a used one that's very affordable. I'll come again in a few days. Bye, bye! Now I understand nothing. Because you just can't read. I'll get out. Because we've no more telly? Now you don't like it, huh? I have told you: there is no space for a bike! They wear me out. Me too. Where's the beer? - Is that all? - They've smashed four. What next? You're good for nothing. Get more! You still have the change. They have taken it away from me. You've got to believe me. - Give me the rest of the money! - They've taken it away from me. And you put up with it? I don't know. Of course, Boris can stay a few days. But in the long run, it's no good. I'll be in trouble. We have no room either. - Should I go? - No, stay for now. I'll put a couch in the garage, yes? Now get in! Slowly! A seat is reserved for everyone. Come on Boris! Get in! First comes Hasso and then you! - This gang is terrible! - They are just hyped up a bit. You lot sit down! And properly! Anyone not behaving properly is sent home immediately. Is that clear? Oh dear colleague, help me a little bit. Stay calm colleague, just stay calm. We don't go anyway, before everyone has sat. Quiet! You don't mind, right? Hey, what do I owe for the honour? - I wanted to sit there. - Now it's taken. You, go to the back and let me sit here. - Well, I guess we can go now. - Yes please. We win! ...as with Henschke. And you, don't brag so much! Don't be provoked, Ms. Winter. It's important now for Boris that he learns to join the others. That's the object of the game, for them to express solidarity. But I ask you! Not against the teachers too. Sometimes against the teachers too. I'll talk quietly with the boy. Next time, we drive you from the field. One way or another. Well man, you've been great too. So, now we shower first, yes? Hey Kanake, you need an extra invitation? - Eh, Ms. Winter! - Yes, what do you want? At least he's answering to that. Come on Boris, get into the shower now. - I don't have a towel. - Well, we'll even manage a towel. He's scared. What's that? Why don't you get undressed? Him? He has never showered in his life. At the pool also, he always skived. No wonder he stinks like that. Now, come on! Come on! Stop! Let him be, will you? Boris can manage on his own. Well, come on. Get up! You have to shower every day now. Well, don't whine. We don't do it every day. Oh man, hey, just because Ms. Winter likes to hike. Tomorrow we're doing something sitting down. So, here's the cowshed. The cow will calve soon. - Are they huge! - From a distance, they look smaller. Ha, when it steps on your foot! Well, how much does a cow weigh? - Well, maybe as much as a car? - Maybe not so much. How many times heavier than you is it? What do you think? Estimate it. Well, maybe 10 times. Yes, you could be about right. And how much does it really weigh? Well, I don't really know. We have to ask the farmer. You don't know? And then you ask us? So? That's the best thing to do if you don't know something. Just you wait! Where does the milk come out? - Down there from the teats. - Yes, where, there? It's pumped by a machine. Twice every day. - How much do you get from an udder? - About 20 to 30 litres. The corn grows on shit? Nah! Pay attention: The soil converts the manure into nutrients for the plants. What next? Bread from shit? - Are there rats, even? - There are no rats. At most, a few mice. This will not do! He has a catapult. - Did you know that he has it? - Yes! But that's a weapon! - Boris, come! Give me the catapult! - No! - Don't you want to take away the thing? - Why? He is good with it. Aren't you, Boris? He'll also make a new one very quickly. I'm sorry, Mr. Henschke. I can't tolerate that the students walk around with weapons. I'll have to add it to my report. Then do it, Madam, if you need to. Old goat! What have you been thinking of, man! Don't you realize that you could have hurt Ms. Winter? I don't like her. Oh, and you just shoot at anything you don't like? Don't you realize that you get me into trouble too? I was so angry because of the report, she mentioned. But I've only shot the glass. You stupid idiot, man! And now? Now she writes a worse report. Say: Can you imagine what this means to me? Maybe it wasn't good that he shot the glass. It sucks, that's for sure. I know perfectly well that he didn't want to hit Ms. Winter. - He could have hit her. - I don't think so. Neither do I. He's too good. He just freaked out because she is such a goat. He wanted to show her. He wanted to scare her. Well, he's not that good with a catapult, is he? If he'd wanted to hit her, he would have hit her. - Man, what a fuss about the stinker. - Stay out of this! So if Boris has to go, we all go. Come on now, Hasso! If you've been doing something wrong and the others support you, then you've got nothing against it. So, and I can now see how to handle Ms. Winter. You've cooked that up pretty well. What are you doing here? I don't think much of such disciplinary action, and certainly not with Boris. But you see what happens if you do it your way. The boy has shot your glass and not you. Boris can handle his catapult very well. What do you mean? Ms. Winter... The boy felt it, that you reject him. When he drew out his catapult the day before and wanted to shoot a rat or a mouse, it was for the recognition. Instead, you've only rebuked him and then talked about your report like it was a court record. And so you've created the incident. Should I have thanked him for shooting the glass? No, but you could've asked why he did it. With a bit of humour that would have been a good opportunity to get through to him. You know yourself how much these kids are in a mess. They are constantly criticized and scolded. Everywhere they find people who reject them more or less. What these children need is praise and a feeling that they are accepted for what they are. They don't react to criticism and punishment any more now. And why? Out of pure self-protection. So... I think your point is just as likeable as naïve. But in my experience, your method is a dangerous dead end and simply can't be justified in school practice. Nonsense! Everyone experiences what he wants to. With your attitude towards the students, you make very bad experiences. I'm talking till I'm blue in the face. Oh well. You have the say here: Should Boris go home? So when? And who takes him? Well, you of course. He just runs away from me. And why? Because I'm a man? Or because he trusts me more? Of course, because he trusts you more. Sit down again. You're behaving like the children now. If it doesn't go as planned: there's immediate, total frustration. Please! I don't want to hurt you. What does that mean? I'm your teacher representative and of course care that you take your exam well. So what? I have a suggestion: We forget this whole thing now. I will not mention the incident in my report. Boris doesn't need to know though. - In other words: Boris stays. - Yes. How you'll give Boris a reprimand is up to you. Okay. Will you drink some wine with me? Yes. But first let me make my rounds. Don't mind the goat, man. You're afraid that they'll dismiss you? Sure, they send you away and that's a good thing. - Because he's stupid. - Because he's stupid and admits it. Not even our friend, Henschke can help him. But, if he'd lied, Henschke wouldn't have believed him anyway, because he has a catapult after all. Could have been that I threw a stone. - You wouldn't have dared to anyway. - What wouldn't I? So men! Come on. Tomorrow is another day. You've already worn this shirt all week, right? I no longer have a clean one. - Well, have a laundry day tomorrow. - If you help me. I can't do that alone, you know. By the way: Boris stays. Just this once. Well, you see! You did get excited for nothing. Us, they'd sent home straight away. Stinkers are entitled. You did this. Right, Mr. Henschke? - Man, that's great, ain't it? - Ms. Winter has done it. So, you lot, switch off the radio now. - Good night! - Good night! Come on! We'll chat up the girls. Let the ass fuck off first. Man, go ahead. I'm hot already. Man, you'll just get caught by Winter. - Not us! - It's not for squirts like you, is it? Come on! I can't sleep. Neither can I. Man, it's like heaven tonight! Do you know "galaxy"? - No. - Well, the Milky Way up there. - Why Milky Way? - Well, so it is called. The stars, in which we are, grouped together. About a hundred million. Can you imagine that. And all just in our galaxy. And there are many of them. It's all written in your book? Do you know how far the nearest galaxy is from us? Two and a half million light years. If light goes out from there today, we'll not see it for two and a half million years. We won't live to see it. But I'll bet that there is life there. - Where? - Well, up there. Some like us. Or others. And they may know of us. Imagine that! Wouldn't be bad. Maybe they'll come sometime. So, as I see it, they'll finish us off. Why finish us off? Well, because they want to live here too. - Well, let's go back. - You're frightened? When they come down here we're already dead, man. Man, just look! Isn't that Heidi? What's she still doing here about? It's Hasso. He has it in for Adelheid. - Why is she running? - Be quiet now. - Let's go. - Shut up and don't move. Come on, if she squeals on us and talks to Winter or Henschke. You'll get a clip round the ear soon enough. Come on now. The sissy bitch is talking to Henschke. If she does, things'll look differently. Let's go back before he comes to see us. I don't want to miss out on this. Adelheid is in her shirt, you see? And at night with Henschke? If the cunt disses me... Let me go you vile dog! You talked, yes? With Henschke, the hog. I didn't. I'll scream. I'll scream, if you don't let me go now. - Was it nice with Henschke? - Vile pig! You're very good at cards. - Come on, it's your turn. Diamonds. - Yes, I'm just looking for one. I'm to walk with my children. Does someone want to come along? - It's boring, man - Such kids' stuff is bullshit. I'll play some more. Okay, I'll go with you. - How so? - Come on now! Well, have fun! Well, Hasso? Didn't you want to come along? I've changed my mind. And out with you! Get out! - So, here we are again. - Was it good? - Beautiful. - Did they behave? Like lambs! Oh Boris. Are you back? No. Harald, come here! Was it nice? Are you hungry? Something happened, Boris. Mother was wasted for four full days. They've admitted her to hospital with alcohol poisoning. Now she is in withdrawal. So, you can't stay with her now. - Hi, Boris! - Harald, say it. Well, the youth welfare office was here twice. They're making an exception with Veronica. I said that we'll marry but... You have to go into a home now. I'm sorry, but I'm supposed to get you there. I can do it alone. Milk! - What else? - The sheep also. Of course. Where else would ewe's cheese come from. And what else? Here under 'cattle', there's something missing that's very important. - Yes? what? - Well, you should answer that. - Meat? - Oxtail. Yes, for all I care. One more for sheep: Leg of lamb. It always hangs in the window at the Turk. Man, great! If you cooperate so well during my exam, then I'll get the best marks. Sorry. Come forward please, Boris. Tell me: What's the matter with you? For a week, you've been chronically late. I just don't have an alarm clock at the moment. Your mother can't wake you? Boris? Boris! Well, come on. I know that you're here. Oh, snap! - Why are you sitting in the basement? - I live here. You live here? - You can't be serious? - Yes, that's just fine. Really! But I have no alarm clock. You can't stay here. If I leave here, I have to go to a home. - And your mother? - Gone off. Now look: You come with us now. And after my exam, we'll see. - I don't want to! - Boris, I've told you: I'll take care of you. Boris! Boris! - Good morning! - Good morning. Sit down! So, people! The moment has come... - But we'll get it done, won't we? - Of course! Now he is scared shitless. - Anxious, Mr. Henschke? - Yes! A little bit already. Relax, we'll get this done. Do you want to go on vacation after the exam? - No, why? - Because of the large bag. I see. A big surprise is inside. People! Do me a favour and don't speak all at once today. - I'll say nothing then. - No, you have to say the right thing. Oh well. The auditor has to be on his way, already. Are they real assholes? - Well, I hope not. - What is it about anyway? - Good morning! - Good morning! This is my plan for the lesson. - Well? Had a good sleep? - So-so. Well, let's start now. So... We've visited a farm on our school trip. You've seen there a lot of what you previously didn't know. - That there is livestock. - Right. And what does this mean? At a farm everything is useful. Even the waste. Yes, they produce meat and then... Just a lot more. Come together here! All these things originate from a farm in some way. I want you to find out what comes from which animal. - Yes, that's a brush. - Man, everyone knows that! Yes, but where is it from? - Well think about it! - Look, feel the bristles. Well, that's a swine. Domestic pig, sorry. - They're called bristle hog. - Yeah, right. And this pillow here? Just feel it! Come on, Hasso. You too. Well, what do you think? - What's probably in it? - Doesn't matter. Well, it does matter. If you walk into a store and want to buy a pillow, then you must know if there is foam or straw in it, or... Feathers or down. I won't let you take the piss out of me. Ask Adelheid, about the cushion on which she lay in your presence. Hey, you lousy pig, you're off your rocker. - Here we go. - Weirdo! - Pipe down! You too, Adelheid. Come, sit down please. What was that again, Hasso? He just wanted to make one of his stupid jokes. Mr. Henschke! Just chuck the boy out. You have the right to remove such a troublemaker. Yes, I know, but... Just use it if you see fit. In this case I think it doesn't fit. Not only because of Hasso, but because of the class. You wanted to avenge yourself a bit? It was announced for quite some time. Chuck him out, finally. It is your exam after all. I can't hide behind my rights here, just to show off a controlled lesson. And sweep the real problems under the rug. And what are the problems? You must know then, or even have seen, that Adelheid came into my room at night time? I don't know what you did with her, but she was only in her nightie. And you draw your own conclusions? How can I understand all this, Mr. Henschke? I'm just trying to resolve the matter. What, then, happened with girl? Is it... I mean, has it come to any fondling? Of course not! - Or? - Well, Heidi just likes you. You nasty, bad guy, that's something only you can think of. But it is surely ruled out, Mr. Henschke, that you permit a student in your room at night. What would I have accomplished if I'd kicked her out? Just because there is this directive? I wanted to hear first, why she was so excited. And she explained it to me. She was just scared and couldn't sleep. Scared? That's not enough, Mr. Henschke! The accompanying teacher would have been competent. - That was me. - Oh! But Mr. Henschke has with his students, an unusual relationship of trust. I can understand that Adelheid went to him and not me. - She has a crush on him. - Look who's talking! And if she had a crush, that would be something bad? It happened to me as a student. Have you at least informed Ms. Winter of the incident? No. I was of the opinion that the matter shouldn't be hyped. - You wanted it hushed up! - That's vile! You nasty pig! You ass! Boris! Don't start too. I saw what happened! And Kalle did too. It was like this: Me and Kalle were out to see the stars. Hasso and Achim went to chat up the girls in the girls' house. Heidi had enough and ran away. She was hiding in his room. When he came in, they just spoke. They had only spoken. We watched through the window. And then she left. To her cabin. It was like that and nothing else. And that one just wanted to skin and salt Henschke. Thanks. There was a lot going on, on your school trip. Yes, and especially at night, huh? So I think we should believe the boy. You nasty pig, you squealed on us. That's a bad tone. Can't you stop this. Hasso, that isn't true. Adelheid has not ratted on you. She didn't say a word about you. Otherwise you probably would have to leave and that would've been just as difficult, as with Boris. This ass-kisser! - Don't say that again! - Come, come, come. That's enough. Please sit down there. So this is now really a bit much. Take the boys out please. I made this mistake once. That is why he has pulled his show. No, Hasso has his place here just like everyone else. So, now I would like to continue with my lesson. So, how was that? What is the difference between down and feathers? - Susanne? - Well, down, huh? They're very soft. Like on the front of the chest. Yes, right. What Will Become Of You?
