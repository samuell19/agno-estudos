It's not… I can't really say it's the main theme, because the films have many themes. But it's the ever-present tenor, the ever-present question that's posed. Or an ever-present attitude more than anything else. That's what links films like Buena Vista Social Club, Alice in the Cities, Until the End of the World, or Wings of Desire. One can't say there is a theme, but… if anything… there's a common motif that they all possess, and that is… the question, "How should one live?" That is… how can we manage, in these times, with all the things we experience and what happens in the world… How can we manage to find out what we live for? And that, I think, in all the films I've made… is the central theme. What do we live for? It is a very personal question, and it requires a personal answer. But precisely when you do answer it personally, it becomes relevant. If you answer questions too theoretically, nobody's interested. And if you answer too personally, nobody's interested either. But when you look at them from personal experience, and are prepared to share this experience and to deal with this experience in an extreme way… it is, ultimately… something that concerns everyone in one way or another. Films often say more because of what they don't say, or show more because of what they don't show. Film deals a lot with the inexpressible and… the indiscernible. But insofar as it deals with the inexpressible and indiscernible, it sometimes reaches our subconscious in a different way and is able to actually talk about these things. There are landscapes in which he feels really comfortable. Anything that's not green… I think. Well, deserts… in every respect. Anything with sand and concrete… …and open expanses… A really empty landscape with a clump of grass… he'd find that fantastic. But… But he also likes anything that's urban… derelict or run-down urban landscapes. That's how he grew up. This here is more or less the view from my room in Sterkrade. I found the industrial sites very impressive in my youth. That's the pit in Sterkrade. Nights as bright as day, all those chimneys… We had deep red and yellow sunsets because the air was so dirty. I painted some water-colours that looked just like this here. I remember how my father-- That's my art teacher. I always got A's in art. I remember how my father saw me filming out the window, and he said, "What's so interesting out there?" He couldn't understand that… Oh, those are my parents. Klaus, my father, and my mother. He couldn't understand my filming strangers, or even the landscape. Look, the pride of the family, our first Citroen. That must be 1960. It was the first year that we lived in that house. Poor Klaus suffered because of that violin! I think that's Christmas. He wouldn't play in public otherwise. Yes, the baubles. That was our first Christmas in that awful town, Sterkrade. Oh, that's me. I got some skis. I'd forgotten. My father was a doctor in the only way one can be. The way he operated was almost aesthetic. It was… simply breath-taking. That's why I wanted to be a doctor at first. And I'd have been a surgeon too. Doing something else didn't even enter my head at first. I only realized early in my medicine studies that it wasn't my own path. To liberate myself from this incredibly powerful image of my father… and find my own way, that took some time. Our father's taciturn manner, was passed to us, his sons. Neither of us was very talkative. It was difficult to discuss certain things with our mother. She wasn't very open. Neither Klaus nor I talked much about what we did at school. Our father had no time, and we didn't tell our mother very much. Perhaps because of her frail health or because of her nervous constitution. She was often unwell… so we tried to spare her that. That's my mother. All mothers looked like that back then. For Klaus and me, Mother never played such an important role as our father did. He was the parent we both related to. My mother, who always put herself in the role of the housewife, never had her own opinion and would wait to see what Father thought. And then she'd adopt his opinion. You internalize that as a child and stop asking her opinion. You ask the father directly, since you know what she'll say, that she shares his opinion. She only… spoke well of her husband and of their marriage. I only heard from others that they had fights or problems… but not from their mother. It was completely suppressed. And I think that all of that is rooted somewhere deep within Wim. He drank it in with the mother's milk. I know families where everybody talks at once. At friends' homes, where everybody sat at the table and talked. I wasn't used to that. I sometimes found it quite exciting that other people talked a lot. We didn't talk much. Especially not at mealtimes. I can't be sure what's coming. Let's take a look. I think I shot this film in Sterkrade. I guess I was about 18 then. 17 or 18. I made it with Ulrike. It's one of the few hand-held camera films. That's her, by the way. -You made that together? -Yes, we made it together. That was a house that her father built. Nouvelle Vague! Trés Nouvelle Vague! It's very Anna Karina-esque. -Did you know the Nouvelle Vague? -No. I don't know where I got the idea. -How old was she at the time? -Ulrike was about 15 then. What were your first impressions? He couldn't ice-skate very well. Well it was just kind of teenage flirting. I was 13 at the time… and he was 17. It was really my first true love. The first time I really fell in love was with Ulrike. And as is the way when it first happens, you naturally think it's forever. I was very preoccupied with Existentialism. Camus was my big hero. I loved Camus more than anything, more than Sartre, who was intellectual and impressive, but only Camus really moved me, which was important. And I shared this passion with Ulrike back then. The main issue was "the meaning of life". What's the meaning of life? Do we have to live? How should we… Yes. It was quite destructive in some ways. We talked a tremendous amount. And spent a lot of time simply not talking. Since Wim was always very taciturn. Did Wim Wenders have a best friend? No. So he had many people around, but… I think that I was his best friend. I was a pupil at Oberhausen and lived in that room when I first met this then young man. I was in my… last year at school when Peter Handke, in Sterkrade… no, in the Oberhausen Municipal Theatre, premiered Offending the Audience. For some reason it was held in Oberhausen. That's where I first met him. There was a discussion in which we locked horns and had a good quarrel, and somehow it led to us forming an acquaintance. It was quite casual at first, I was just a schoolboy… Then I met him again two years later in Düsseldorf. He recognized me, and we somehow became friends. He is, so to speak, my oldest friend. Peter… My first pieces, from the Oberhausen days, were staged by a man who's long-since dead, Günther Büch. Wim was in the audience, and he came up to me afterwards. He stood in the corner in such a way that one couldn't miss him. And… we met often after that. I lived in Düsseldorf back then. I immediately felt close to him. He still painted at the time. Film wasn't yet on his mind. Anyway, we started talking, and he radiated a kind of warm-hearted loneliness which drew me to him. Well, that… is doubled in this picture. After breaking off my studies in medicine… in Freiburg, I told my father that I… wanted to be a painter. And… where do young painters want to go if not Paris? I often sat on this corner reading. It was my favorite spot. I lived about 200 meters away, on Rue de La Seine. I'd go down Rue de Seine and I was at Pont Neuf in no time. And I'd sit for entire afternoons under those trees, reading, drawing, or whatever. It was my favorite spot. Yes… the old Cinematheque. The stairs… I went down these stairs every day, usually just one time, and then I hid until the next film started to avoid paying again. In the Cinematheque, I guess I saw… at least 1000 films in all, the whole program every day. I watched from noon till midnight, regardless of what it was. Every single retrospective, I watched the entire history of cinema. Sometimes five in a row… Or even six. Then he wrote to me and said, "Now I want to make films." Yes, after Paris… I went to Munich. Because in the newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung I'd pinched from "Deux Margots", I came across an announcement in the arts section: "Film Academy opens!" Munich Academy for Television and Film. It was a confused time there. We were just guinea pigs, the very first students. It was shocking how rigid and conventional it was. There was no practical film-making, there was one creaky old camera that ran on mains, so we couldn't carry it or use it outside. Just one, for all the students. There was no acting instruction, no film history, nothing… that had anything to do with film. I learned very little there, I must say. It was a great time. I mean, we all ultimately profited from that. But it wasn't as if one could say, "If I hadn't gone there, I would have missed out." We learned a lot from each other, we all worked on one another's films. And we made the films on our own initiative. It wasn't planned. They were astonished by our demands to make films ourselves. There was one thing I could do which was, I think, important for my fellow students, and that is, I always did a lot. If I got an idea in my head, I followed it through. They thought I was nuts when I planned a full-length film on our 15,000 deutschmark budget. They all planned to make 10- or 15-minute short films, and I made a two and a half hour film with the same money. But I resolved to do it, did the sums, and thought, "It'll work." And I think I was important for many of them, because I proved that you can create the thing you want if you want it enough and believe in it. I went to Munich at the same time to do theatre studies. And we both thought, "At last we're together." Far away from Sterkrade and our parents and so forth. So… But before I went to Munich I was in Paris after he'd left… and I… met another man. Thanks to Wim, actually, because he gave me the address. And I fell head over heels in love with that man. And that was, of course, a major shock for him. Yes… and then it was over. And how did he cope with that? He didn't try to hold me back. He just accepted it. Which was something… that somehow… …astonished me. I always told him that if he really… That if he really wanted to carry on… living together… Well, we never lived together. But if he'd wanted that we stay together… he could've fought for it, fought for me. But he didn't do that. It was simply over for him. Was he a person who fought for things in general? Yes… He did fight for his film stuff. Hollywood! Yes? Good morning, darling. I'm looking out over Lake Steinhude. Where are you? Yes. I'm going to Himmelreich now. It's a town. I'm going there. The name has to catch my interest before I'll go there. But Himmelreich, "Heavenly Kingdom", you can't top that. Everyone wants to go there. There was a bar in Munich which was called Bungalow. And there was a… …kind of back room, with pinball machines. And there he stood, playing pinball. And… there was something about it that I found really, really cool. I mean, I was so childish back then. Well, anyway… I asked, "Who is that?" And then… someone said to me, "Oh, he's a film director." And so I asked him, "Is that true?" He told me he was a film-maker and I was deeply impressed. Edda wore the trousers in our apartment, and was also politically active. She was arrested in '68, like me. But since she was Austrian… and was being charged with breach of the peace, she was facing expulsion. So we said… we can't allow that, we can't lose Edda. One of us must marry her. Maybe he didn't fall in love with me. But I wouldn't believe it. Well… I don't know. It just turned out that way. In any case, I totally admired him and… And he was simply… unbelievably serious. Well… I could talk about childhood… I could discuss anything with him. I could accept criticism from him that I wouldn't have accepted… from anyone else. I felt he saw me, noticed me. For example, on my own I'd never have noticed a chewing-gum machine. And… he always managed to get toy rings out of them for me, and tons of them at that. And… things like that are enchanting, aren't they? I showed… especially for first year students at the Munich and Berlin film school… …I did a series of short films portraying the history of film and showed Alabama again and again and… I don't know if… no, probably not… if that got gradually stronger over time but over the years it became more and more difficult with this film. To understand the film, or…? No, but because it's so slow. -The tempo wasn't right for the time? -No. And this slowness had… back then, when the film was made, a fascination… which was so strong that it took a long time until the fellow students had got over it. The short films… by Wim Wenders, especially… Alabama, created something… No one had filmed Munich and Munich's surrounding area in that way before. And no one had seen it like that before. And… the fact that suddenly… the area that you know so well yourself… because it's your own, is filled with so much… space… was something very important, and in a certain way it was also political, I think. The early films have an incredibly deep inner calm. And I think one sees that. It was something within him. Did you like Wim's student films? Oh, yes. It was like being liberated from the narrative. It was a time when people wanted to get away from stories, plots, Hollywood… It was natural. It was liberating that nothing had to happen. Without this… deep, inner calm, he would never have become famous. Because that is… That is particular to him. And becoming famous is part of that. Just being in the public eye, to simply be yourself, you can only do that… when you have a truly deep sense of inner calm. And I think that his films… demonstrate that. It's always beside the phone. Just here. And… I think this picture came out really well. I don't find it particularly caricature-like, but rather… He is really like this sometimes. That's why I always keep it there. Because… Well, he is actually a pretty crazy guy. But I mean that in the positive sense. And it was in Munich that I got to know this young man. He had a healthy sense of self-confidence. He introduced himself as a cutter. So we met up in the cutting room, and there were these damned long scenes. I said, "Long is okay, but…" "Short scenes, lasting effect." And then we just… He had long hair, it was the style… Me too! Down to my shoulder. It was great! And then we did Summer in the City. He sat beside me the whole time, and we somehow got the thing done. Short scenes, lasting effect. He did the editing on Summer in the City, and since then… he did everything I filmed in the following 20 years. If I could ever talk of having… a kind of twin brother, then it'd be Peter Przygodda. CIVIC OFFICE SCHOOL I'm a non-smoker, and they all used to smoke hash. It was normal back then… to roll a joint with tobacco. But back then we baked cookies with hash in them. And I'd sometimes have some with me, and we'd go to the cinema together at night when some drama was playing, and laugh our heads off… LEOPOLD CINEMA …because due to the effects of the hash something goes funny in your head and you laugh at tragic scenes, for example. We often got thrown out, but that's what made it so funny. It wasn't always like that. Just sometimes. And that afternoon I had three cookies and I went to the Nest, which used to be our regular café in Schwabing where we'd meet up in the daytime. And they all came in, and I was there too, and Wim came in, said, "Hi, Heinz", and we sat down at a table, I offered him a cookie and he said, "Anything in them?" I didn't know how much was in them, so I said, "Not really". Well, I said no. So he ate all three cookies, which wouldn't have been a problem, but I didn't know he'd then go out and drink several whiskies. The place was called Tiffany's. That was really something. It was really good back then. Keith Richards played there, things like that. When they did their recordings here in the Arabella Haus. The Stones love Munich, right? And we were all there, the whole Lemke gang and all. There were all these full bottles of gin on the table… and then came tonics as well. Anyway, it was always wild. Really wild. And all of a sudden, Wenders came in… totally confused. He stood there, grabbed hold of me and said, "I have to go to hospital." I said, "What?" "Heinz gave me one of his cookies." "So what?", I said. "I can't take it, I must go to hospital!" So I took him to Schwabing Hospital, to the emergency room. And he lay on his bed saying, "Phone Edda! Phone Edda!" So we called her, and a while later, I left. I didn't know about all that. The next day, Klaus Lemke came up and said, "You Wim-Killer!" I said, "What's wrong?" He said, "Wim's in hospital. He had a life-threatening circulatory collapse." Because of the whisky, the alcohol… When you smoke hash or eat cookies you mustn't drink loads of whisky afterwards. That's why he collapsed in the disco and had to be taken to hospital. I only heard about all that later. I felt really sorry about all that. I didn't even know how much was in them, I had got them from my girlfriend and thought, "I'll take some with me, it's always fun." I didn't eat cookies all the time, just sometimes one or two, but he ate all three of them and then made the mistake of drinking all those whiskies, those Jim Beams afterwards. My life had been normal up to then. I wasn't much into drugs. I tried them, but they never appealed to me. I did a few LSD trips and thought it was… a bit silly. Quite crazy too, I experienced a few things… But it didn't really enrich me, and I… wasn't really into it anymore. Until once… when I got into it too much, involuntarily and I had this collapse… Then I was in the hospital… AMBULANCE NO ENTRANCE …and the doctors didn't know how to lower my pulse. It was about 220 or 230, on the verge of ventricular fibrillation. And they just looked at me helplessly, and then at some point I fell unconscious. OVER And then I woke up again and thought, "I'm awake? How strange! It should be over by now." And then they told me I'd pulled through. I was astounded. I had to continue treatment for a while. My liver had been damaged quite badly. I got hepatitis, and had a heart attack as well, at the same time. At least that's what the ECG showed. And I was like a cabbage after that. I didn't know what to do. I didn't know how to live, or what to live for. And my heart would start to race all the time, the same symptoms that I suffered from the overdose. Even the slightest excitement would cause my pulse to rise to 200 and make me break into a sweat. And, the way it often is, I had absolutely no feelings… of self-worth anymore. I didn't know who I really was anymore… or how to go on living my life. And then I began classic Freudian analysis. I found a man… who was already quite old, in his late 70s, Dr Marseille, like the city. And if you… …look at Freud's biography and see the photos of his first lessons in Vienna, his first class of students, my Dr Marseille is in there. He was one of Freud's first students and he still practiced classical Freudian analysis. The classical way, six days a week. Sunday was the only day off. One hour every day without a break, except four to five weeks when he went on vacation. I shot my film in that time. It was my graduation film. Summer in the City and… The isolated guy who drifts through the landscape… that was actually me. Someone who was trying to start again… trying to put some sense back into his life. This very contact- and conflict-shy person, which I certainly was, learned a great deal in this period of analysis. And ultimately, this near-death experience, the overdose that I had… was a profound learning experience. I don't know… how I'd have turned out otherwise, or if I'd not gone through the healing process which was the result of the seven years of analysis that I underwent. Now I know why you're called Mañana! Because you only come back tomorrow. I hope you have some provisions. You could find some ducks and maybe get a tow. Look, they'll be stuck there for the next ten hours. Blow! Should we maybe swim or push it, then? The American Friend, Alice in the Cities, Lisbon Story, False Movement, Room 666… The Scarlet Letter, Tokyo-Ga, Brothers Skladanowsky, The State of Things Notebook on Cities and Clothes… Nick's Film, Wings of Desire and Paris, Texas… -What shall I play? -The Scarlet Letter. -Of all the films! -Then you've got it over with. I'm not in the mood. Oh alright, then! Then I've got it over with, you're right. I'm not in the mood at all! -What? -Someone's drilling. They're drilling a hole so they can watch The Scarlet Letter too. Come on in! The film's not so great that you have to drill through the wall. This is where Rüdiger Vogler enters. His historical performance in The Scarlet Letter. This is where he's discovered by little Pearl, and this is the scene they played together. This is the reason why I made Alice in the Cities. That was the only scene I enjoyed doing. The rest of the film was torture. But this was nice. Even Senta, Senta Berger, was in a totally different mood. Aaaa-merica! -Exactly. -Well, well. Exactly. Ta-da! My elder ego. We always said "elder ego" instead of "alter-ego". Rüdiger… I first got to know him when I… lived in Frankfurt for a year in 1970. I had this script from Peter's novel, The Goalkeeper's Fear of the Penalty, and there was a village idiot character. Can you forgive me, Rüdiger? It was his first role in a film of mine, the village idiot. Seeing, meeting for the first time, one only gets… …peripheral impressions. A big man, lots of hair, big nose, big glasses, big mouth… a gentle being. Alice in the Cities was actually… the most important film in my life, and I projected everything onto Rüdiger that one can project, as a director, into a main role. My elder ego… It was kind of my first… major role in a film. And I was just incredibly happy. I was… It was one of the happiest times for me. I think you can see it, too. I was absolutely… overjoyed to be making that film. Every day of it. Alice in the Cities was really the film where… I realized that this would be my profession. It was the turning-point. I was on the verge of quitting film-making. The Scarlet Letter had been a disappointment, I staked everything on that film. I wanted to prove I could do something unique, or tell a story differently. There are many… interconnected fragments… Riding through New York on a tandem… …going to an ice cream shop which seemed to have hundreds of flavors and getting a huge ice cream with about ten to 15 scoops. Those are my memories of that time. Those real events were always connected to Wim. It was really important. He was always there. If I look into myself, he's everywhere. That he held me on his arm so often was neither strange nor unnatural. I'm moved when I see it today, I find it really sweet. It was totally normal for me to be wrapped in a blanket and carried in his arms… I think it's wonderful. In Alice in the Cities, for example, there is one of the most beautiful scenes in cinema ever. In the ice cream shop, when the young boy sits by the jukebox and hears a song… After this long search for her granny, she says… We searched for her in Wuppertal. And then she says, "Grandma never lived in Wuppertal." There are many ways to react. I could have shouted at her or told her to go to hell, I could've smacked her, I could've done loads of things. But I don't really do anything. It's a very long scene without dialogue. I just have this ice cream spoon, and I go to the toilet, look in the mirror and say, "Oh, boy!" One of the main experiences… or qualities that I remember and that's stayed… in my head is that… he was always close to the camera during shooting and that he watched everything very closely. He's the only person of whom I can say that he saw you, saw what you did. Every… tiny movement, and even the most tiny change in facial expression, even if it was only visible in the eyes or the mouth… He's the only one you could really rely on. He has the ability to recognize how people are. And he observes people, even when they're not on set such as at breakfast, or evenings after shooting. Or the way you sit during a break. And it often happened that he… wanted to have the kind of mannerisms one displayed in private in front of the camera. I rang up a few times. Aren't you feeling well? No. I think Edda put something of herself into it, because the way she says it… I find it totally fascinating the way she stands at the door and the way she says… Her charisma… The way she says her lines is unique. An actor can't do that, but she wasn't an actor. But she was so true to herself, so special… I think it was because… It came from her personal experience, her knowledge, that she was able to say lines like that. I lost touch with the world. You did that long ago. You don't have to travel across America for that. You lose touch when you lose your sense of identity. And that is long gone. That's why you always need proof, proof that you still exist. All your stories and experiences… You treat them like raw eggs. As if only you experience things. That's why you keep on taking photos. For further proof that it was really you who saw something. WISHFUL UNHAPINESS That's why you came here. So somebody would listen to you and to the stories you're really telling yourself. All I wanted at the time was to stay together with Wim. And… And that's always like fighting for your life. Well… and that is… I didn't know that people have to split up. The dialogue… spoken by Philip Winter, as he was called there… when he wants to spend the night with an old girlfriend… I wrote that… although I drew on… conversations that us two had, that Edda and I had. I was trying… to process dialogues that we'd had one or two years before. Stop a moment. -Stop? -Just for a second. Yes! I've been searching for this. Isn't that a great forest border? I've never seen a better one. In the films you made with Wim, his girlfriends always played a part. Did it cause problems on set? I don't really like it, because I don't know… It's a sort of amalgam of professional interests, personal interests, and love and whatever else… If you're outside of it it's always difficult, because you don't see clearly what… Especially when women are involved. But that was just the way he was, and you had to… tolerate it as far as was possible. If not, you'd have had problems with yourself. Those women were important partners. Do you know why he felt it important to have them on set? Maybe he needed protection. In Alice in the Cities two women he'd lived with appear, one was Edda… and the other… Didi, though not for very long. It wasn't about staging actors, it was about recounting his life. It had nothing to do with Didi and Edda, he didn't want to stage them. It was about his life, he wanted to say something about himself. Yes, in Alice in the Cities I actually dared… …to have all the women of my life in one film. Although… the relationship with Lisa only started at the end of the film. -The three knew about each other? -Yes, sure. They knew about each other. It was somehow an idée fixe of mine, for 20 years of my life, that I had no choice but to… That the woman who's there in front of the screen, who you're describing in your film… also has to be your long-term partner. I'm mighty glad all that's behind me. In his early films, women don't play a major role. Actually it is… The way I understand it, he describes the longing for women… through the absence of women in his films. In his early films. Alice, for example… She's a girl, but she's a female, a female person. And to me, she is portrayed best. And I think that's how he prefers to see women: as childish. But I feel the women of his age, his equals, so to speak, never really worked in his films. And I also think that he… I once spoke to him about the reason for it, and I think he… had a traumatic experience. A woman left him at a very early age, a girl, actually. He was with this girl, and she went off with his best friend. For him, that was a decisive event in his life. He didn't fight to keep her or anything, it was as if he was paralyzed after that, he couldn't do anything to stop it. Do you do anything else except test-driving? -I'm a pediatrician. -What? Sort of a children's doctor. I separated from my wife in Genoa. I didn't ask you about that. There's no need to tell me your stories. What would you like to hear? Who you are. I am my story. In German, Kings of the Road is called Im Lauf der Zeit. The word "Zeit" also means that a certain Zeitgeist is present in this film. And by a certain age, everyone's left a woman, or the reverse, has been left by a woman, and… doesn't know how his life should go on. Kings of the Road is… There are these two men… who only at the end define themselves in relationship to one another and… FAST FOOD …only at the end learn from one another. and discover who they are in relation to the other. Above all, they're forced to learn how to resolve conflicts. Kamikaze… goes to his father and does what he's wanted to do all his life. He tells him about his own mother. And he says to his father, "Shut up, let me finally speak!" If you start talking, I'm leaving! Last time I tried to talk to you… I had to listen all the time. I stood next to your desk, embarrassed… because I didn't want to admit… that you're a gabber… that I take you to be gabby. Mother could never get a word in either. That's what I wanted to talk about. That life with you didn't get her anything. Shut up! I experienced this with my father too… The accusation that he… that my mother never got a word in and was never… never… …permitted to express herself… to make an impression. HOW TO RESPECT A WOMAN I feel that the common thread in all his films is the inability… …to express what he thinks, what the characters think. And in this way… …unhappiness is manifested. I feel they are all people who are on the move, people who are searching… for something. They try to be honest… or to search for honesty. It's a kind of continuation of his family, I believe. It is not only about relating his past, he's also attempting to deal with it in his films. In his life, but in his films too. Possibly… the linking factor between his films, which are all really different, no matter how similar they may seem… They are very different. But a possible linking factor is that there's always someone who's alone, somewhere in the film. All alone with himself. This crops up in all his films. In his last one, too. It would be too simple to say it's mostly men. But it's true. I'd go as far as to say that. I think his first films show well how… women are a mystery to him and men… are so easy to deal with that you don't need to say much. Or that you… For example in Kings of the Road, where… at the beginning, Zischler races into the river in his Beetle. Every woman would say, "Tell me! What happened?" They'd say, "This and that happened!" They would chat away like crazy. And the two men? They don't say a word. It's a phenomenon, and I find it great how he depicts it. And it shows… the masculine way in a great manner, very tenderly and very affectionately. Squeaks, right? What do we have in common? I don't know. I don't think we talk very much. It was always like that. I talk more, but more out of embarrassment. Because it is… sometimes rather difficult… to accept his taciturnity. He has a few male friends with whom he likes to compare notes, so to speak. I always say, "Oh, you guys go alone." I'm glad when he nurtures his friendships with men. I think he needs people who challenge him now and then. He's usually the one who calls the shots and everyone goes along with him. It's like a thread running through his entire life… So for him to have people who meet him as equals, who tell him what they really think and maybe disagree with him on certain things, is important. Not confrontation in a negative sense, but in a positive sense. Resistance can be constructive, it offers food for thought and can help you grow. That's something that's sorely missing in his everyday life. Was there ever a major rift in your relationship? Do you remember having any kind of falling-out? No, we haven't had any fights so far. No fights at all. I'm perfectly capable of quarrelling, but never with Wim. Wim isn't someone you can fight with. Well, maybe others can, but I can't. Impossible. I'd almost say it's lacking. He's just… He can't deal with conflict. I would've enjoyed a good row sometimes. No, "enjoy" is overstating it. So is "sometimes". Let's say now and then. There are times you need someone and times you don't. That doesn't change the nature of an acquaintance. Between Wim and me, there's none of this… Neither of us ever gets miffed or feels offended… No one gets into a snit if the other doesn't call or something. If he doesn't call for two years, fine. That doesn't affect our relationship. In other words, in terms of continuity and constancy, our relationship comes close to friendship. But the term "friend" should be used carefully. It's a friendship of sorts, yes. Though it's on hold due to ten years of mutual silence. Not that there's any malice or anything… It's in such people's nature, in this case, his and mine. Besides, he was in the U.S. for a long time. -You had little contact during that? -I have that with a lot of people. You might not have been in touch for a long time, then you get together for a project and it's like you've been on the phone every day. I have no problem with that. I don't need constant… I don't know. That's not how it works. Just five more kilometers to Himmelreich. I hope you're all prepared. Can just anyone get in? Only if you're very good. I'm surprised there's no "purgatory" you have to pass through first. But we do have to go through a "Devil's Moor" to get to "Heaven". Well… The hero. I would guess… that was around when Robby and I shot Kings of the Road. Or maybe it's from when we filmed Alice in the Cities. Yes, that's definitely still Alice… He wore those when we were doing Alice. I was working as a production manager for Geißendörfer when I met him. It was the first film he did the cinematography for, Lena Christ. I was impressed with his work and we became friendly. Later Robby did the camera work on my first 35mm film, which was Alabama, in 1968. And I didn't work with anyone else for the next 20 years… except for this "flying Dutchman". So, you don't remember all that much about that time? No, I remember, but… It's just not on my mind a lot. But wasn't it, let's say… a formative and important period for Wim and you, the many years you worked together? That's romanticized. We were never really friends, ever. I wouldn't consider it a real friendship. -It was purely a working relationship? -Yes. Did the relationship between you change in the course of time? Yes. It's over. And how exactly did it change? Maybe we should ask Wim. I don't have an answer to that. Robby was a brilliant cinematographer. I think we learned a lot from each other by working together on all those films in a row. His work in black-and-white on Kings of the Road was just… One of the best black-and-white films ever. I think the best work we did back then was The American Friend. Much later we shot Until the End of the World together. And that was… the film that made us drift apart, in a way. The toll in terms of organization, energy, morale… We spent over a year on it, and there were plenty of times when one or the other of us said, "I've had it." "I just can't go on like this." But somehow we slogged on anyway. I just wanted to… get it finished. I felt I owed it to Klaus and to my father not to abandon this project I'd been telling them about for ten years. I think that's… what gave me the strength to see it through. And maybe also… accept casualties along the way. So to speak. And when it was over, it was over between Robby and me. Our relationship didn't survive that. We made a few attempts, did a few projects together… But it was never the same after that. The damage was irreparable. Looking back at the time between '70 and '78, would you say those were good years, all in all? Yes. Yes, actually. -So you're disappointed that it ended? -No, I wouldn't say that, that's not it. It's more because everything happened just as it did in the film. And we make absolutely no exceptions… despite our being a so-called "family". Let's put it this way, for a while… he was quite interested in me, sure. But then you get older and you change, and then that can wane, or you're replaced by other figures. America is a different story. What use is a German to him in America? That just doesn't make sense. Maybe that's changed… Maybe it will come back, and maybe not. Maybe he has totally different plans, I don't know. I find him extraordinary as a person, his presence, talking with him, walking with him… His sheer physical and mental presence is… To me, that's almost more striking, more impressive, than his work. Wim is a very imposing person. -By his sheer physical presence? -Simply by being Wim. It has to do with his intelligence and sensitivity, their relationship to another, and with his visual capabilities. It has to do with his powers of perception, which are very highly developed, very unusual. And it has to do with his ability… to be silent. And how he uses that silence as a cover to observe things around him, which is often unsettling. -When he's silent you don't know… -I don't know anything. -Can you read it? -Yes. The depth of focus is okay? Yes, it's fine. HEAVENLY KINGDOM COUNTY OF HANOVER Okay… I'll let the cars pass first. So, this is what happens… when you put too much faith in maps. The disappointments that are inevitable when you believe in names. Like when you're bent on entering Heaven and end up at a shitty intersection where there's absolutely nothing to see. Even though it could've… It was all there. "Dead Moor"… "Devil's Moor"… It all sounded so promising… and then, what a let-down. I met Lisa during the filming of Alice in the Cities. She played Alice's mother. I fell in love with her, and we lived together… for seven or eight years. I came across this. I really like it, so I hung onto it. I'm sure it was taken for a newspaper or something, because it's so idyllic. As you see, the house was full of kids practically every weekend. Wim was quite involved, actually. This is one of my favorite pictures of Wim and Pat. Would you say their relationship was almost like that of a father and son? I did have that impression at the time, yes. As I mentioned, there were situations when Wim would go to parent-teacher meetings and say he was Patrick's father. That was very sweet. -In the garden… -Who's that in back? I hung a picture of Peter Handke, and three years later, a champagne bottle. No idea why I had him there. For old time's sake, or a way of mourning the past, maybe. Peter used to write under that apple tree a lot. I kept a lot of things… Souvenirs from the past, heavy stuff. WILLROIDER STREET It was a wonderful time. The house was beautiful, right on the river Isar. It was a peaceful time, a carefree time for both of us. There was Lisa's son, Patrick… He was practically like my own son for a few years. We were… a real little family. But that alone didn't fulfil me. Lisa was very attached to our way of life, everything… including the jukebox to… the house, the cat and the dog. I remember one situation… when I could no longer bear the lack of communication between us. It seemed we never really talked anymore. I went to a phone booth and called him, and I remember he was furious. I said I finally wanted a chance to talk to him. It seemed he was always upstairs, writing, always busy with his next film, and we never really talked anymore. I never asked questions. If he didn't tell me, I didn't ask. When he did give me information, it was always of his own volition. Sometimes I felt hurt when he didn't tell me certain things. Sometimes I'd think, "Why is he paying to tell a therapist about these things?" "Why doesn't he talk to me?" But I guess he figured, "It's my problem, it has nothing to do with you." Sometimes it's hard to read him, to figure out what he's thinking or feeling. If I want to know what's on his mind, I'll sometimes ask him to draw a bear. And with a few strokes, he manages to get across exactly how he's feeling. This one is very typical, for example. He left it for me to let me know he got up really early this morning… I EXCERCISE! …and had gone to do some exercise. As soon as I saw it, I went right upstairs and fixed a nice breakfast for him so he'd feel better. YOU OVER EVERYTHING! When I saw it, I knew right away how he felt. In the beginning it often seemed I'd tell him something and wouldn't get a reaction, and I thought he hadn't been listening. But after a while I noticed that a day or two later he'd make a remark referring to what I'd said two days before proving he'd actually listened carefully and given it a lot of thought. He usually has something very astute to say. But often he's not ready to say something right away, so… Now I'll just float an idea without expecting an immediate reply. So there's a sort of a time lag in our conversations. I know that if I say something, it will take a while for him to answer. And I've learned that if I rush him, it takes that much longer. One mustn't take it personally, that's just the way he works. There's almost something autistic to it, but in a positive sense. He… will turn something over in his mind and simply not be able to talk about it. Until the thought has ripened… and then, out it comes. We never spoke about what his going to the USA would mean. I assumed our relationship would survive a year apart. My feeling was, "I've settled down and I'm going to be making films." But I suspected that those films wouldn't open any new horizons for me. That thought really scared me. That it would become routine… That I'd start doing things just because I knew how. I went to the USA because I didn't know the game there. I wanted to keep making films that were challenging, tell stories I hadn't told before, try things I hadn't tried before. Our relationship was so close, and there was something so final about it from Lisa's side… I felt like I didn't have… any space to grow. And so I decided to… go and live in the USA, to make a clean break and leave my old life behind. And that hurt her terribly. I was still in the process of becoming who I am. At the time I wasn't at all sure if I was anyone yet. And what I experienced during my time in the USA, which was six or seven years, after all… That actually did turn me into a different person. I learned what the protagonists of False Movement and Kings of the Road could only dream of: That is, as in the fairy-tale, I set forth to "learn what fear is". And when I returned to Germany seven years later… it was a conscious decision, and I was no longer the same person. There's a lovely saying in German about how each frame in a film tells us something about the frame of mind of the person who made it. Maybe that's what my films have in common: they reveal Wim Wenders' "frame of mind"… And what I've learned from it all is that… Looking back at the 30 films I've made… I'd say that what remains in the end, or at least, the films I think will stand the test of time, the only ones worth making… were those that were really made with conviction and love. In between, there were a lot of others that were made without much conviction, that I wasn't as deeply passionate about. And I think, ultimately… they won't last. A few will endure. I know that myself. And if they do, I know it will be because… For the simple reason that… the way of seeing the world they reflect… will endure, as well. I can only go forwards.
