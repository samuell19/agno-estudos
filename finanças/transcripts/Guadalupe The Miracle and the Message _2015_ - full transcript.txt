Nearly five centuries have passed, yet this event endures in the hearts of millions, transcending divisions and uniting cultures with its timeless message. An ancient fabric miraculously intact, an image that defies scientific explanation, an intricate set of symbols that would bridge two worlds and countless cultures, and the transformation of a continent. This is the story of Our Lady of Guadalupe. When Pope John Paul II arrived in Mexico City for the canonization of Saint Juan Diego in July of 2002, millions of Mexican Catholics turned out. They lined the streets and filled the plazas. They came together to celebrate the making of the first indigenous saint of the Western Hemisphere and the woman whose image has changed the course of history. - The canonization of Saint Juan Diego is very significant, because if the apparition of Our Lady of Guadalupe is not authentic, there is no Saint Juan Diego. So as part of that whole process of reviewing the life of Juan Diego, you have to validate, authenticate the apparition of Our Lady of Guadalupe. So that's one way in which his canonization is very significant. When the Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés landed in Mexico in 1519, he encountered a thriving Aztec empire that extended throughout Mexico's central plateau. According to an indigenous legend, the Aztec god Huitzilopochtli delivered a sign indicating where they should build their city: at the site where an eagle, perched on a cactus, was seen devouring a snake. In 1324, the Aztecs founded a city named Tenochtitlan, which for them was the center of the universe, the place where the cycle of the universe was sustained by human sacrifices. Hernán Cortés formed a military alliance with native tribes opposed to the Aztecs. Amazingly, in just two short years, he succeeded in conquering the Aztec empire. The Spaniards began constructing a new capital using materials from the recently destroyed Tenochtitlan, or present-day Mexico City. During the first stage of evangelization, a few missionaries attempted to convert the indigenous people. However, the task would prove to be a very arduous undertaking. - To understand the dramatic impact that Our Lady of Guadalupe has on the native population, you really have to put yourself in the position of these people at the collapse of the Aztec Empire and what their understanding of religion really was. We have to remember the horrific face of the Aztec deities that were there to receive the human sacrifices. We have to understand the history of the Flower Wars, in which battles were waged in order to obtain prisoners for sacrifice. So now what were the native peoples expecting the god of the Spaniards to be like, the victors to be like? Bishop Juan de Zumárraga was known as protector of the Indians. He bears the responsibility of defending the natives from cruel abuses carried out by the new Spanish government, including their widespread enslavement and murder. His courageous stand leads to at least one assassination attempt by corrupt members of the first audiencia, or royal court, in New Spain. Bishop Zumárraga, infuriated by the continued abuses, and facing numerous threats against the lives of his fellow priests, decides upon drastic measures. In 1530, he excommunicates the members of the first audiencia and abandons Mexico City. Zumárraga wrote a letter to Emperor Charles V detailing the many abuses carried out against the native people. The story of what happens next is passed down through the centuries by the humble man who experienced this event and who shared his encounter widely. Eventually, his testimony is captured in an ancient text known as the Nican Mopohua, written in the 16th century by the Indian scholar Antonio Valeriano. The Nican Mopohua recounts the story of Juan Diego, a Catholic convert and widower. His Indian name was Cuauhtlatoatzin, meaning "eagle who speaks divine things." Some skeptics have cast doubt on Juan Diego's historical existence, a claim denied by Miguel León-Portilla, a premier authority on Aztec language and culture. - In the apparitions in Mexico of Our Lady of Guadalupe, like many other apparitions in the world, oftentimes Our Lady will appear to very humble people and, in this case, to the Indian Juan Diego, a humble man, a very simple man of simple faith, because those who have a heart like children and who are open to God can receive this message. On December 9, 1531, Juan Diego walks along the western side of Tepeyac Hill on his way to catechism at a Franciscan mission just north of Mexico City. According to the account in the Nican Mopohua, the woman identifies herself as "the mother of the true God" and asks that a sacred house be constructed in her honor on Tepeyac Hill. She asks Juan Diego to bring this message to Bishop Zumárraga. Juan Diego returns to Tepeyac Hill empty-handed. The woman asks him to return to Bishop Zumárraga with the same message. He obeys, and this time, the bishop asks for a sign. On Monday, Juan Diego fails to show up. His uncle Bernardino is gravely ill, facing death. He asks Juan Diego to find a priest to administer last rites. On December 12, 1531, Juan Diego sets out towards Tlatelolco to find a priest for his uncle. In a hurry, Juan Diego tries to avoid meeting the virgin. He goes around Tepeyac Hill, but the woman comes down from the top of the hill and cuts him off. Juan Diego explains why he is in a hurry. But the woman tells him to have no more fear, that she holds him in the fold of her mantle and in the cradle of her arms, and she assures him that his uncle is well. Juan Diego asks her to honor him but letting him be her messenger. Our Lady of Guadalupe now instructs him to climb to the top of Tepeyac Hill and gather up in his tilma all the flowers he finds. Upon reaching the summit, Juan Diego is amazed to find extraordinary flowers in full bloom. These flowers would be the sign for the bishop. This remarkable image... Inexplicable in its style, luminous colors, and imagery... Would change the course of history for the entire continent. Today that sacred house asked for by the Virgin is now the Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe, the most visited Catholic shrine in the world. Each year, millions of pilgrims come to celebrate their faith and the miraculous image of Our Lady of Guadalupe. The shrine of Our Lady of Guadalupe is a source of inspiration for the faithful. They come here to find the comfort of their mother and to pray for her intercession. - A lot of the pilgrimages that I've done, a lot of the people are from the United States. They don't have any Latino heritage or anything. But they've always wanted to go, and the blessings that they receive... I've seen people start to pray the rosary again. People have gone to confession for the first time in many years when they've gone to the shrine. Spiritual direction, the healing of marriages, reconciliations between family members and so forth. It's really a tremendous blessing that takes place there, and I think that Our Lady's presence in that tilma, still to this day, has a lot to do with that. - The first time I went to the shrine of Our Lady of Guadalupe and approached the tilma, I knew I was entering into the presence of something sacred and holy. The supernatural presence of the icon made an impression on me. I was immediately touched by the devotion of the people. I mean, it was an incredible experience of their tenderness and their approach to Mary as their mother. And from that moment on, I've had a loving experience of Mary. The image of Our Lady of Guadalupe holds many unsolved mysteries. The first mystery is its very existence. A 1946 study by the National Autonomous University of Mexico confirmed that the tilma is made of ixtle, or izote agave fibers from the cactus plant. - I think it's very important to examine miracles in a scientific way and to look for an explanation in the natural world, which everybody tends to do and wants to do, and then we discover a rather miraculous things that can't be answered from ordinary experience. In the 18th century, a scientist named Dr. Bartolache commissioned the creation of two works similar to the Guadalupe image. These paintings were also created on agave cloth and were placed in locations around the Basilica of Guadalupe. The survival of the tilma is even more amazing when one considers that it was left completely unprotected for more than a century. Many aspects of the image defy logic and science. The tilma has a seam running down its center rendering the cloth a poor canvas choice. But researchers are astonished to discover that the very flaws of the tilma's fabric reveal the genius of the image. The tilma also lacks any preparation or imprimatura, a necessary step when painting on fabric. The lack of preparation is made clear by a startling realization. The same image appears on both the front and back of Juan Diego's tilma. In 1795, an accident nearly destroys the tilma. A worker cleaning the glass encasement clumsily spills nitric acid on the image. Among the many wonders of the Guadalupe apparition are new discoveries being made into the images present in her eyes. José Aste Tonsmann is a Peruvian engineer and an expert in digital image processing. In the late 1970s, he began applying his studies to the tilma. In the human eye, the cornea reflects the image in front of us. Both eyes will show the same image but different sizes. This phenomenon is precisely what Tonsmann found when magnifying both eyes. Each eye contained mirror images of the same scene. The incredible devotion inspired by Our Lady of Guadalupe and her miraculous image can be traced back to the very first years following her apparition to Saint Juan Diego. Despite ongoing tension with the Spanish colonial government, the apparition triggers one of the greatest conversions to the Catholic faith in history. - This marks a difference in the type of evangelization between the New World and the Old World. What had been the typical model was, one baptized the prince or the king or the queen, and the followers followed his decision as to the religion of the kingdom. But in The New World, what happened with Juan Diego and Our Lady of Guadalupe was a conversion beginning among the people that then filtered up instead of a conversion at the top which filtered down. The native people are drawn by Juan Diego's powerful encounter with Our Lady of Guadalupe, but they are also amazed by an image that reveals the Christian faith through symbols they could understand. In Aztec society, codices, or pictorial manuscripts, were an essential means of communication. The image also contained symbolism that would transform the worldview of the indigenous people. Their new understanding of God and of love would help eliminate the long-standing practice of human sacrifice. Like European iconography, Our Lady of Guadalupe is standing on the moon, but for the indigenous mind, the moon represented the home of the omnipotent God. The many symbols in the image of Our Lady of Guadalupe led to millions of conversions. This powerful symbolism was further strengthened by a major festival called Panquetzaliztli, celebrated around the winter solstice, which, in the Julian calendar, took place on December 12th, the same date as the apparition of Our Lady of Guadalupe. - With Our Lady of Guadalupe, what we find is actually the transformation of a culture according to new norms validating its own heritage and its own history. Good example of this can be seen in Mexico in 1544, when Mexico experienced one of the worst droughts in its history. Typically, the Aztecs responded to such a situation by the massive sacrifice of many young children. After Our Lady of Guadalupe in 1544, there was a massive pilgrimage of young children to the shrine of Our Lady of Guadalupe, so the transformation from a culture, we might say, of death to a culture of life. Our Lady of Guadalupe is often called La Morenita, a reference to her darkened complexion that makes her the perfect symbol of a mixed people. - Saint John Paul II referred to Our Lady of Guadalupe as the perfect model of enculturation. This means that she comes to the indigenous people in their own customs and imagery. And, in fact, in her face, the mestiza face, they see in her an affirmation of their human dignity, their human worth, and of course the response is overwhelming. Even during the Mexican Revolution of 1910, Emiliano Zapata and his troops entered Mexico City carrying a banner of Our Lady of Guadalupe. Despite Mexico's Catholic identity and the Guadalupan devotion, church state tensions reach a peak during the 1920s. In an effort to suppress the faith of Mexico's citizens, the government set out to destroy the church's most important symbol. In 1921, an agent working for the government places a bomb hidden in a basket of flowers directly under the tilma. In the following years, the persecution of Catholics only increases. This leads to a rebellion against the repressive government known as the Cristero War. These Catholic freedom fighters choose Our Lady of Guadalupe as their patron and their inspiration. Many victims of the Cristero war flee to the United States. This mass immigration serves to increase the already budding devotion to Our Lady of Guadalupe outside Mexico's borders. - The Cristero imprint on Mexicans coming to the United States was rather large, because a lot of the people who were exiled from Mexico during the Cristero period came to Los Angeles, and they wore it on their shirtsleeves. That was... if you were Mexican, you were a Guadalupano. And so the devotion has been very strong. It's spread now throughout the United States. In 1941, delegates from the 20 American republics came to the shrine of Our Lady of Guadalupe in Mexico City to pray for peace amidst the horrors of the Second World War. Archbishop John Cantwell of Los Angeles led a delegation from the United States. The Mexican church was so grateful for Archbishop Cantwell's presence and support that they gifted the Los Angeles archdiocese with a relic of Saint Juan Diego's miraculous tilma. To this day, it remains the only such relic in the United States. In recent years, under the auspices of the Knights of Columbus, the relic has passed through numerous American cities and been venerated at large Guadalupan celebrations in both Phoenix and Los Angeles. N- In speaking of a New World, what we're really talking about is the unity of different peoples and different cultures to create something that did not exist before. In the United States, for example, our country is a great melting pot of many immigrant groups, of many ethnicities, of many religious traditions coming together to forge a new society. This is primarily the message of Our Lady of Guadalupe, that regardless of differences, there is a basic unity of human dignity and a respect for different cultures. And if we maintain that, we can actually create something new. - I have my passion for surfing, and I have my passion for Our Lady, especially Our Lady of Guadalupe. When I was a young man, I was raised in a very difficult, tumultuous family setting, and I really bit onto the culture and the bad things of the culture. So I got involved with a lot of drugs and lot of promiscuity. It was after reading a book about the Blessed Virgin Mary that I really got what I call the divine 2x4 experience. God just hammered me with the truth, and I fell madly in love with him and with Our Lady and with the Catholic Church. I do consider myself a Guadalupano. She's my mother, and I feel united with those that I don't even speak their same language. A mother always unites her children, and that's a big part, I think, of Our Lady of Guadalupe. The spread of devotion to our Lady of Guadalupe across the American continent is captured in this beautiful and idyllic shrine dedicated in her name. La Crosse, Wisconsin, is a far cry from bustling Mexico City, but it is here that a new generation of Guadalupanos is being formed. - Thank you very much. - Thank you. - After the synod on America, the church in America, in which Saint John Paul II underlined so powerfully the importance of Our Lady of Guadalupe for the living of the faith in the whole continent: North America, Central America, South America. Then I understood that it should be a shrine to Our Lady under her title Our Lady of Guadalupe. - We have people coming from everywhere. I've had people from as far away as China. The ones that are always the most interesting are the ones who simply see the roadside sign and just come in. - What I hear most of all from the pilgrims is that when they come here, the minute they come up on the grounds, they have a sense of peace, and they're inspired to pray. The heart of the message is very simple, that she wants to show to her children God's love for them. - I've always been infatuated with the story of Our Lady of Guadalupe and her message and Saint Juan Diego, and we've always tried to share that with our children, and we happened to kind of just stumble upon it. Then we found out they were building this church, so we've kept coming now for the last eight or nine years. - I came from California, from San Diego, to commemorate this shrine, because she is Our Lady of the Americas, and she's really a lady for all of us, for those from the tip of Argentina all the way up to the United States and Canada. So we look to her for guidance, for inspiration in our daily lives. The shrine in La Crosse has opened new hearts to the message of Guadalupe and has united people of all ethnic backgrounds in their common faith. - I can speak to Our Lady of Guadalupe's effect in the local community and with the people who come here. It's a community of believers, and I think that the propagation of devotion to Our Lady of Guadalupe beyond the Hispanic community will simply bring more understanding that we're all in this together. The whole thing initially was funded by well-meaning Anglos, non-Hispanics who simply caught the message of what the Pope was saying and what the bishop, now Cardinal Burke, was saying and went with it. It's... you have to see it to even believe this could happen. As patroness of the Americas, our Lady of Guadalupe also inspires Canadians. And in a special way, she speaks to the First Nations communities. - When I read that story and how, as early as December 1531, when Our Lady appeared to an indigenous person in Mexico, speaking his language and taking, in fact, a complexion of indigenous children, I was just overwhelmed and deeply touched. First of all, she takes the complexion of our people and how she knew of the particular distress that the people were in, how they were treated less than human but how she came to raise their dignity. And when you stop and think, when Our Lady appeared to Saint Juan Diego, at the time, his age was 57 years old. And so she appears to elders, which elevates, then, the significance of elders in all our cultures as indigenous peoples. Inspired by the mestiza face of Our Lady, Nicholas began touring First Nation communities with the Guadalupe image, sharing Juan Diego's encounter and example of an enculturated evangelization that respects indigenous culture and experience. - When I first saw the missionary image of Our Lady of Guadalupe which is Canadian, I fell in love with her immediately, but I was overcome by the fact that this was the face of Our Lady, of the mother of Jesus. And the only place in the world where she has left behind her face was in Mexico. Each summer, I bring the missionary image of Our Lady of Guadalupe to this area of New Brunswick and go around to not only First Nation communities but non-native communities as well to actually share the story. And so when you hear words of people who are the walking wounded and then later on you see them rejoice, they say, "Thank you very much for bringing the story of Our Lady of Guadalupe to us." And there are many, many stories over this past eight years that I've taken the image around where she has brought great comfort to people. - The fact that Our Lady of Guadalupe communicates with a poor person like Juan Diego is a message of what we call now option for the poor, which Pope Francis is talking about all the time. Our church must be a church of the poor for the poor, evangelical poverty of simplicity and of humility and that is a very strong message for today. While devotion to Guadalupe remains most widespread in the Western Hemisphere, it is increasingly a global phenomenon. At the National Shrine of Our Lady of Guadalupe in Manila, Filipino Catholics continue a centuries-long tradition. - Our Lady of Guadalupe has a great impact on the Filipinos. The devotion was brought in from Mexico through Spanish missionaries and such that by 1935, the Holy Father Pius XI, at that time, decided to declare Our Lady of Guadalupe as the patroness of the Philippines. There are two things that were originally, I think, was the inspiration for the people to be in love with Our Lady of Guadalupe. One is the color. The color of the Blessed Mother Guadalupe is an Indio, and we were called Indios by the Spaniards. The second is that the one to whom he appeared was also an Indio, Juan Diego. I think that the impact of the devotion to Our Lady is not only on families but all society in general. - Until recently, Our Lady of Guadalupe has been seen almost exclusively as a Mexican phenomenon or a Latin American Hispanic phenomenon, but we need to open our horizon a bit. We have to understand that she is the patroness of the Philippines, and so she reaches the hearts of millions of Asians. We have to remember that at the time of the appearance of Our Lady of Guadalupe, New Spain existed throughout the western part of the United States, and so she is an apparition for the United States as well as for Mexico. - Our Lady of Guadalupe is the mother of the Sisters of Life. We process to her every night at the end of our night prayer, throughout our convent, singing the "Salve Regina," acknowledging her as our mother. Unlike her other apparitions, there's nothing like the Guadalupe apparition, because when she came here, she came simply as a mother. She didn't exhort the people to prayer, to conversion, to fasting. That wasn't her message to these people. Her message was a message of love. She came with the assurances of love, that "I am here, I am your mother." - In my confessional in Philadelphia... I hear confessions every Sunday night, and right outside my confessional is a beautiful mosaic of Our Lady of Guadalupe. I can see through the door the number of people who stop at the shrine of Our Lady of Guadalupe and pray as they prepare for confession, and I think that it's kind of symbolic of the role of Our Lady of Guadalupe leading us further into our Christian life day by day, asking us for constant transformation, change, and conversion. - Our Lady of Guadalupe has been referred to as the Mother of the Civilization of Love. So what is the motherly message of our Our Lady of Guadalupe? It is one of concern, of compassion, of love for all members of society, even the poorest, even the outcast. And so if the person is created out of love for love, only a civilization of love is worthy of human dignity. And this is fundamentally the message of Our Lady of Guadalupe. For almost five centuries, Our Lady of Guadalupe has united bitter enemies, endured as a symbol of hope, and defied scientific explanation, becoming the patroness of the Americas. Today her presence is as real as it was in 1531, when Juan Diego first walked up Tepeyac Hill and encountered the woman millions would come to call "Our Mother."
