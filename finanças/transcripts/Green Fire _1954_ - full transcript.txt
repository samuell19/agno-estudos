The name is Rian Mitchell. Thank you. - I ran into a couple of horse lovers. - El Moro's men. Even today our mountains have animals that do not walk on four legs. El Moro? If you just get me patched up I, I got to catch a boat to the city. - He has a bullet wound. - Let's get him inside Father. - How do you feel? - Not quite sure yet. I'm Catherine Knowland. - Oh, thank you for putting me up. - Just a flesh wound. You'll be fine after a few days rest, you were very lucky. - It's what I was thinking. - Señor Mitchell... - I'm glad to see you're with us again. - Hello Father, you see... all I needed was couple of hours sleep. - Did I say something funny? - You were brought here yesterday. Yester... - You mean today is Saturday? What time is? - It's almost two. Why? Oh, if I'm going to catch that riverboat, I better have to get a mover. You're not thinking of leaving today. Yeah, I have a partner who worries about me in the city. - But you're in no condition to travel. - You will be wise to listen señor Mitchell. In the absence of a local physician, Catherine has become quite expert. Well, so I see. Well, I haven't lost a patient yet. Now, don't go spoiling my record. Don't worry about me, one week on that floating palace and I'll be as good as new. An iron man. I'm surprised a bullet could pass through you at all. This is really important. Is there any way of getting me to this boat? Well, if you insist, I'll get the Jeep. You'll find everything you need in the dressing room. - Shaving kit and some clothes. - There we go. - How's the patient? - He thinks he's ready for the Olympics. He looks like a man who's been places and done things. Don, weren't you and the men going to shore up the levee today? Well, just give me a minute to shore up my own levee. A man can break too, you know. I'm sorry Cathy. We might as well face it, we're getting deeper in the hole all the time. Well, now that we've hit bottom, there's no place to go but up. Oh, this year we're going to have a fine harvest. Things will be just like they used to be, you'll see. Good try Cathy but I still believe coffee is best in a cup. Say, on a terrace overlooking the Mediterranean. I'll get right to work on the levee. Oh, by the way Father. - What happened to the shirt I was wearing? - I'm afraid there was not much left to burn. - But I thought you would like to keep this. - Yes, I would. Thank you Father. - You have good news for your partner. - Well, I'm alive, thanks to you. That will please him of course, but, I was thinking about Carrere. - Carrere? What's that? - The mine señor Mitchell. You found the lost emerald mine of the Conquistadores. You mean that? That's only a bit of beryllium Father. A piece of beryllium doesn't mean to say I found an emerald mine. But you did. - What makes you so sure? - Because 5 years ago, I too found Carrere. You're wondering why I have kept it a secret? The wealth of the smallest emerald could do much for my people. But it could destroy them too, turn brother against brother, pour blood upon blood. Oh, the history of Carrere is not a pleasant one. That is why I was hoping you would not return. Look Father, I've been all over the world searching for the jackpot that wasn't there. Lasseter's Reef, Opal Valley, Golden Horn, you name them, I've dug for them. You know I'm coming back. - Pretty good fit, eh? - So I see. Will you thank your husband for me? Donald is my brother Mr. Mitchell but I'll thank him anyway. Is all this yours? Must be quite a project growing coffee. My grandfather used to say there's nothing to it. You just find a wilderness, clear the land, plant the seed, watch over it while it grows. Then, after 5 years, if it hasn't been killed by root borer, caterpillar... frost, moss, drought or flood, you got a coffee bean. I never knew, from now on, every breakfast will be an adventure. - Oh, I'm sorry. - Oh, Iron Man. Come aboard señor Mitchell, we are about to sail. - Well, I'll see you next trip, eh? - You're coming back? - Sure, I've got to return the wardrobe. - That will make Donald very happy. Señor Mitchell, you will have to come aboard at once. Oh. Yeah. Well, I've brought you this far. Every minute I get deeper and deeper in your debt. Medical care, transport, outfit and now, money. You've got quite an investment in me. So I have. I hope you're the kind of girl who keeps an eye on her investment. You'd better meet me when I come back. Señor Mitchell, if you are not on board at once, you are not on board. - Will you? - You'd better go. See you the next trip up the river. Mister, buy ticket, - No. - Buy lottery ticket. Maybe you win many pesos. Please mister, buy ticket. Maybe you win. You know, what I like about you Dolores, is the way you run an office. Rian... Baby. Hey, you've been brushing up on your shorthand. You were gone so long. You said only three weeks. - Well, now I'm back, were you true to me? - Oh, yes. - I do nothing, just wait for you. - Oh, that's a good little girl. - Now, where's, where's Vic? - He's gone. - What do you mean he's gone? - Gone, he left a message. Don't worry baby, we need nobody here, except you and me. Dolores, just for once will you be a secretary and give me the message? He said goodbye, he likes you, you should drop dead. Where is he? Where he go? To the steamship office to buy at ticket for Canada. - Canada? - It's a good riddance. - Now we could be together all the time. - Yes, yes, of course. Now, Dolores, you just catch up on your sleep... like a good little secretary and I'll be back in no time at all. - Rian. - Yeah? You will not go away again? No, no, no, this time it's for always. Seventeen hundred, eighteen hundred, nineteen hundred, two thousand. The boat leaves in an hour señor Leonard, you are on B deck, cabin six. Thank you. Give him his money back, he's not going anywhere. - Lock up the safe. - No, no, no, simmer down Vic, - I know you're mad but I didn't... - Mad? Me? Let me ask you, would be mad if your partner took the last... 500 bucks out of the kitty to go climb a mountain? Listen, you blithering wart hog, I found it. I found Carrere. I hope you'll both be very happy. Perhaps you didn't understand what I said, I'm offering you half an emerald mine. Will you stop horsing around? I'm going to Canada. As for the emerald mine, you can have my share. - Easy come, easy go. - Just... - It will be a few minutes sir. - Thanks. You know, I never saw a man so anxious to run out on a fortune. - Well, now you've seen one. - Doesn't money look good to you anymore? What looks good to me is that boat. Pigheaded old thing, will you cool down? - Where did you get that shirt? - Oh, never mind about that. That reminds me, I checked your duds at the club. You're too kind. Now, will you take a look at this? - This happens to be beryllium, not emeralds. - You call yourself a mining engineer? Where there's beryllium, there are emeralds. They go together like ham and eggs. - What about a little thing called money? - Well, 5,000 bucks would swing it. - For labor and equipment. - Only five thousand, eh? That's no problem, you cash in your ticket, I'll run it up in no time. - Playing Tejo? - My arm feels hot. Señor Leonard, we are ready for you now. Well, like they say chum, this is it. Yeah. Tell me, what is in Canada? The Manitoba Carbon Company, you're looking at the new foreman. Carbon? You'll end up in a straitjacket. Be a nice comfortable feeling after knocking around with you for 12 years. Regular hours, weekly paycheck, might even find myself a girl and get married. Now, don't let's overdo it chum. Oh, the point is Rian, I'm tired, I'm tired of gold dust that turns out to be sand... diamonds that turn out to be glass and emeralds that turn out to be beryllium. You're breaking my heart. Go on, catch your boat. No hard feelings. You just put an extra million in my pocket. Meanwhile, you'll need something for the rent. So long pal. - Ah Rian, it has been a long time. - A long time, will you cover that? - Sudden death, eh? - One throw. Ok. - One more Rian? - No, some other time. - Any luck, señor Mitchell? - Yes and all of it bad. Perhaps you would like a drink of the house? - Vic, I knew you'd change your mind. - No, the boat burned out a bearing. - We're sailing at midnight. - Oh, I should've known. A man goes crazy, he doesn't get his marbles back in a few hours. Give me another one Pedro, I need it. - Come on. - Arm got cold, eh? You don't risk it, you don't win it. You'll never change. Pedro, me too. She comes over here, we buy her a drink, the two guys resent it. Words are exchanged, a fight starts, we wreck the joint. They call out the militia, throw us in the cooler. Midnight the boat sails without me. - I just thought that... - Don't think. Yeah, well, of course you're quite right. That's exactly what I was planning. You can't blame me for trying. You know, we've been together a long time, I'll be kind of lost without you. Not that you're any great shakes as an engineer, mind you but... Well, I got so used to having you around. You know, I really believe you're on the level. - Anyway... - But I'd like to have it your way pal. But I'm afraid I've had it. I don't know, the old motor is kind of tired, really needs a carbon job. Hey, that's not bad. - You get it? Carbon job? - I get it. - I'm sorry. - Well, so long Vic. - It's been a lot of laughs. - Oh, what's your rush? - There's no point in dragging it out. - Oh, come on, I'll buy you a drink. Get a lot of time to kill. - You want to buy me a drink? - Yeah, I want to buy you a drink. For auld Lang syne. Alright. Just one, for auld Lang syne. Pedro, fill them up here, will you? ♪ Be forgot and never brought to mind ♪ - ♪ Should auld acquaintance be forgot ♪ - Pal, pal... ♪ Should auld acquaintance be forgot and auld Lang syne ♪ Here you are chum, cabin six, B deck. You're a real pal, you got me on board just like you said. I... - Forget it. - Oh, oh, steward, steward. My friend has had, you know, couple of... See he gets ashore Ok and no breakfast for me. Yeah, I'd better get you to bed boy. Yeah. Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. I paid for a single, who's the other fella? What's the difference? It'll give you someone to talk to. You're a pal, always a pal. Boy, the boat is rolling. Haven't even left the dock and it's rolling and... When you wake up baby... don't forget auld Lang syne was your idea. Ah Rian, you have come back. Carlos my friend, I came into an inheritance by way of Canada. Sudden death? - All of it, my friend? - All of it, two thousand. Two thousand? - Vic. - Looking for me chum. - Alright alright, where is it? Come on. - Wait a minute, wait a minute. Vic, feast your eyes on that. - Suppose you'd lost? - The point is, I didn't lose. Don't give me that malarkey. Give me the dough, I'm going to Canada. There's enough here to tear the insides out of that mountain. Be practical, Canada can wait. This is what we've been looking for all our lives. Maybe I didn't make myself clear, the answer is no. Emeralds Vic, not carbon, emeralds. Just for a few months on a mountain. At the risk of being a bore, the answer is still no. N O, no. I must be crazy, it's the only answer makes any sense. Believe me Vic, you made the right decision. Well, if the emeralds are as big as the mosquitoes, we're in great shape. Oh, you don't have to worry about the mosquitoes where we're going. The sort of place a man dreams of finding all his life. Hospitable people, warm tranquil days, cool nights. And the view, wait until you see the view. - Blonde or brunette? - Eh? We've been together a long time pal. Ah, she's a blonde vision of loveliness. Yeah, she'll be waiting on the dock just where I left her. She makes all the others look like lampshades. Tell me, do you look for the mountain first then the girl or the girl, then the mountain? I just thought I'd ask. You know, they always seem to go together like the chicken and the egg. - What now? - I don't know. What's the matter amigo? I don't know, there's something wrong. Always they have come out for their supplies. I don't like it. Looks very bad. I'm going to shore and find out what has happened. Wait a second, why don't you send the mate? We'll go along with you. Oh, thank you señor Mitchell. El Moro. El Moro. Quick. Get under that hut. El Moro seems to have taken over. - Every hut is a booby trap. - Who is El Moro? - Didn't I tell you about him? - No, you neglected to mention it. Some other time. - What's he after? - Anything. Supplies, ammunition, hostages, he's not particular. - Whatever he's after, let's get out of here. - How? Fast. Tranquil, hospitable people, I must be crazy. You didn't exaggerate a bit, she is a blonde vision of loveliness. She'll be waiting for me on the dock, right where I left her. Come on, let's get this stuff unloaded. - Señor Mitchell. - Yeah? There is señor Ruiz, he will take care of you. Señor Ruiz? What can I do for you? Well, I want provisions for 25 men for a month. - I can arrange that. - Then I want the men and a couple of horses. I can arrange that also. We'll be working a mine, it'll be mostly pick and shovel. - A mine? Where is this mine? - The mountain above the Knowland place. What's the matter? - My men will not go with you. - Why not? - They will not go with you. - Well, how do you know? I know. Guess this just isn't your lucky day. - Yeah, well the day is young yet. - Where you going? To church. Got to be a first time for everything. - Hola señorita Knowland. - Señor Ruiz. Well, if it's about the men for the harvest, I was not expecting you until next month. Yes I know but we ran short of supplies. Well, I'm always very happy to serve you. Were there any passengers for the village? Two misters. He's in church. - Who is? - The other mister. Oh, you must be the partner he mentioned. Vic Leonard. You're Catherine Knowland who foolishly helped to save his life. He was a little surprised when you didn't show up to meet him. - Oh, the confident type. - Yeah. - This time I think he's over matched, nuts? - Yes, I think I will. Ah, señor Mitchell, I will be with you in a moment. - You have played tejo? - I've been known to. A wonderful game, one day you and I must oppose each other. - I have a feeling we're playing right now. - Something is wrong? You must preach a powerful sermon Father. I mean that one that keeps everyone off the mountain. Oh, that one. Yes, it was one of my best. What do you do? Threaten everyone with fire and brimstone? No, no. I merely told them the story of a man who climbed a mountain looking for treasure. He was robbed and shot by El Moro's bandits. And he would've been clawed to death by a jaguar but for the hand of Providence. A real try. It does seem to have given them a measure of wisdom. I wouldn't bet Sunday's collection on it Father. Well, you see, there are only two places in the world you... find emeralds, Colombia and Siberia. And one of those is a closed corporation. Well, what happens if the men won't go to the mountain? Then we're sunk. For gold, you can go out alone with a... prayer and a pan but for emeralds, you have to have manpower. Hi there. You're late. I'm sorry, I was trying to arrange for a red carpet and a brass band. - You two seem to be getting along. - Splendidly. You didn't tell me how charming your partner was. I never noticed. But what kind of a doctor do you call yourself? You haven't even inquired about my side. Well, I assumed you'd be bright enough to stay off bumpy roads. Forgive me, how is your side? Well, I think it's going to need a lot of attention. Look, how is your engagement book fixed for say, Saturday? Dinnertime? Saturday is fine but, will you still be here? Why not? Look charm boy, she knows, if we can't get enough men to work the mine, by Saturday we'll be halfway back to the city. Vic, you ought to know I wouldn't let a little... labor problem interfere with my social life. - Well, what you going to do about it? - I'm about to clear that up. Your partner specializes in getting his own way. I'm the living proof of that. Right now, there's a steamer bound for Canada with one empty stateroom, mine. Alright, you're hired. You're hired. Ok. You, take off your shirt, take off your shirt. Alright, you're hired. Alright muscles, go on. You're hired. Not so frightened of El Moro this morning, eh Father? Obviously, your sermon was more powerful than mine. Oh, I just used a different text. Greed is stronger than fear. I offered a thousand pesos to first man who found an emerald. You. It is more than they would see in a lifetime, I wish them good fortune. - Ah, you the one who speaks English? - Yes, patron. - What's your name? - Manuel. Manuel. Alright Manuel, you're in charge. Tell those boys to be ready in one hour. - And get rid of these. - Yes patron. Alright boys. All clear, back you go. Make a nice paperweight. - Manuel, you get the guards posted? - Yes señor. Well, another day, another nothing. - Why don't you ever look on the sunny side? - I do, I do, it just eludes me. - Where you bound for? The opera? - You know, I'm worried about you Vic. You can't seem to get your mind off emeralds. Would become an obsession, you know, all work and no play. - Hey, we got a dinner date. - That's right. Of course, if you had the inclination to work a night shift, I'll make your apologies. - Very funny. - Señores, someone is coming. Halt. Hello there. Hey, you must be Donald. Last time we met, you weren't in any shape for introductions. This is my partner Vic Leonard. This Cathy's brother. - How do you do. - How are you? Thought you might like some company riding down. Oh, that's very thoughtful of you, like a drink? - No, I'll, just be a minute. - Better pack a couple of toothbrushes. Too dangerous to come back tonight with El Moro on the loose. Cathy is prettying up the guest room. Hey, that is not only thoughtful, that is inspired. Like to look around? - You bet I would. - Ok, come on. Now mind your head, pretty low in here. Wait a minute, I'll get a light going. There we are. Quite a setup. Most of it was done for us by the Conquistadors. The original timber. Been there hundreds of years. Of course, we've to shore it up as... we go along or we'll be wearing a mountain for a half. Look. See that rock formation? See where the green shows? That's what keeps the miners going. That's a sure sign that emeralds are around. Any luck yet? What we've found so far wouldn't make a trinket counter at a Five and Ten. Nature is pretty cagey about her emeralds, he hides them away in little pockets. Look. Like that. I think she forgot to leave one in that one. Now, that's the trouble about tunneling. You can come within six inches of a million dollars and still walk out a beggar. Of course, I could do better if I could step-dig. Step-dig? Yeah, you know, cut the mountain down from the top, layer by layer. - Don't miss a pebble that way. - Oh, why don't you? Why not? The miner's lament, money. Step-digging takes hundreds of men and a massive equipment. All the same Rian, I'm betting on you, even in a tunnel. I only wish I were up here with you. What's the matter? You lost your taste for coffee? I've been a disappointment about that to everyone. The only son, family tradition, you know how it is. It takes a green thumb to run a plantation. It's one thing I didn't inherit. You've got the right idea Rian. Move around, take your chances, don't get stuck in one place. Don't get fooled by all this, this is a grubby life. You take my advice. Hang on to what you've got. - Well, I know... - Come out, come on quick. - Oh Vic, this is one of El Moro's boys. - Well, what do we do with him? Send him back. - What? - Sure. Then he'll tell El Moro that we're very well... prepared for anyone who shows his face up here. - Manuel, better double the guard. - Si patrón. A lovely evening but crowded. I'd much like you to show me the plantation. Later, I'm sure Vic would enjoy it too. - Let me freshen that up for you. - Sure, thanks. Father, it might interest you to know that Vic... here is quite a student on the religious movement of South America. - Is that true señor Leonard? - Well, I... Oh, don't be modest Vic, he's got a whole library on the subject. - One day we must've a long talk, you and I. - Sure Father, fine. Well, there's no time like the present. Now don't you worry about us. Cathy is promised to show me around the plantation. You two go right ahead, shall we? Well señor Leonard, as you know, the historians tell us... that the Jesuits first landed in Colombia in April of 1590. If I were to tell you that it was a month earlier, would that surprise you? Some. - Was a very tricky maneuver. - But why? Oh well, now you're not going to tell me Vic is a student of the religious movement? You know, he's brighter than you think. Well, it won't hurt him, we'll let them wrestle it through to say, 1890 and then go to his rescue. In the meantime, there's all this, a classic setting... a man, a woman, a tropic night, a beautiful river. Oh, that's fine, except no one who lives here thinks the river is beautiful. The villagers call it mujer traidora, a treacherous woman. - Is that so? Would've fooled me. - Well, not in the rainy season. Why, without the levee, there be riverboats running up and down the plantation. - You haven't heard a word I've said. - Of course I have, I was just thinking. - What? - About you. It's an odd sort of life, isn't it? Don't you ever get lonely? - Yes, desperately. - I should think you do. First of year I went to school in California, then the summers Father took us to Europe. - Oh, I see, never here. - No, never here. It's hard to believe, I mean, you're under 50, you're not altogether unattractive. Oh, well don't get the idea I spend my life fenced in by the jungle. I go to Bogota and Barranquilla and I've lots of friends. And I even managed to wangle a couple of proposals. - Turned them down? - Yes. Well, I'm not exactly panicky yet and... Well, there's always the chance that Prince Charming... may come riding down off the mountain someday. When he does, find you're beautiful. I take you must be the expert on the romantic movement in South America. I wanted to do that from the first day we met... I thought about you all the time I was away. - I thought about you too. - That seems to make it unanimous, eh? - There's one thing wrong. - What is it? I just, I just don't want to be a Saturday night girl waiting at the foot of a mountain. No. I think we better get back, I'm sure Father Ripero is well into the 20th Century by now. If there's anything you want to know about the religious... movement in South America, don't hesitate. And you never know when that kind of information may be useful. - One day you'll thank me. - Oh sure, sure. By the way, that's quite a girl there, are you thinking of going in the coffee business? It's not a bad idea, maybe a partnership. You know, put an emerald in every can of coffee, kill the competition. First, let's find the emeralds, shall we? You may not know it pal but you struck it richer down here than up there. The homely philosopher. - Hey, give this one a bath. - Hey, that looks like... Well, we can corner the paperweight market. Why, you old pessimist, they're there, we'll find them. Well, we better find them soon or I'm back in the carbon business. Only by now they probably filled the job. All we can put up a sign, free dirt. Oh, I wish you could've seen Vic's face. Of course, he was quite right, there was a lot of free dirt... and most of it was in our mouths. Well, landslides aren't very new around here. Years ago, there was one big enough to change the course of the river. I bet it would take more than a landslide to change your course. Well, it's taken me a long time to get to that mountain. - Tell me something Rian. - Sure, anything. What keeps a man looking for the rainbow all his life? Well, if you catch a rainbow, there's a premium on it. There's premiums on other things too. Oh, you mean a place to hang your hat, roots in the ground. - Something like that. - Well, it's not only the money. The mountain itself. There it sits, calm, peaceful, like an iceberg. The danger is hidden beneath the surface. It'll kill you the first chance it gets. - You make it sound as though it's alive. - Well, it is for me. My father was a coal miner, spent half his life down in the dark, grubbing for pennies. And a cave-in took the other half. Right then I decided that one day... I'd go into a mountain myself but I'd come out rich, not dead. Do not move. I am El Moro. We have no guns, do his hands have to be tied? We were wondering when you were going to get around to us. Take what you've come for and get out. I do not come to make trouble. I wish to talk to señor Mitchell. - Quietly, not between gunshots. - What about? The work you are doing in the mountain makes me happy, very happy. - Well, don't get hysterical. - Of course, you do not understand. - I explain. - Tell him to keep back. Geraldo, he is harmless. You see señor Mitchell, the mountain, it is mine. - You don't say? - You are surprised, I don't blame you. It is a deed to the land. It's been in my family for many years. Big surprise, no? We talk, inside. With your permission señorita. As you see señor, a very old deed. I wish to live there someday when I'm old. But now I find you are ruining my land. But perhaps we can make an agreement, see? - What kind of an agreement? - Reasonable, very reasonable. If this deed is legal, our claim is worthless. But I wish to be fair, without engineer, the mine is worthless. Thanks. If he kill you, who would find the emeralds? - Yeah, I get your point. - I'm ambitious man señor Mitchell. I wish to grow, for this, I need money, great deal of money. So when you find the green fire in Carrere, we will share it. We'll be partners. It's only one thing that worries me about this ancient family document. The ink is hardly dry. - You say I am lying? - Yeah, that's right. You were right, it was carelessly done. But it was one way to have an agreement without bloodshed. - You see how quick people are hurt? - No deal. As you wish. You are educated man señor Mitchell. Engineer work hard, you'll find the emeralds and when you do, I will know about it. - And then I come back for my share. - I'll be waiting for you. I couldn't sleep either. El Moro meant what he said about coming back. I know. El Moro doesn't worry me half as much as you do. - Me? How? - Donald tells me you're going to Bogota. - Only for two weeks. - To see anybody in particular? Of course. A coffee broker, age 73. Seventy-three? Wonderful time of life. - Now don't tell me you were jealous. - Homicidally. The new Rian Mitchell, an improvement over the old one, don't you think? - Well, let me think about that on the boat. - I'll miss you. - Two weeks isn't so long. - Fourteen days. Only two Saturdays. No, you going to keep clubbing me over the head about that? Saturday night girls become a way of life when you move around. What is it? Rian, I don't think I've ever been in love before. Not really in love. - I wouldn't want it to go wrong. - Why should it? People want different things from life. Your way is to go from mountain to mountain because you feel you have to. Well, mine is to take roots here, where I belong. - We're just too different. - You know, you're just like Vic. You worry too much. Good morning. - Yeah, welcome home. - Anything on your mind? - Maybe. - Like what, for instance. - Cathy. - What about Cathy? Look Rian, I never said anything about the others, that's your business. You know, Dolores, Connie, that turkey up in Nome. This time is different Cathy is a nice girl. I know that, no lectures chum please. Well, I just want you to know that if anybody hurts her, I... might get the urge to loosen his spine. This sudden rash of chivalry, is it on general principles or do I detect a personal note? - Any law says I can't like a girl? - No law at all. Well, just remember what I've said. What's going on here Roberto? Alright, keep it quiet, get me that light. Now calmly, what's going on? - He tried to steal the reward. - He lie, I found the stone. Where? Where are they? - It came from there. - I saw first. Yeah? Then you can have them, they're worthless. Now go on, get back to work. Cut out this scrapping, go fetch señor Leonard. Nice work, a good sign, means they're here somewhere. If only we could get lucky. Cave-in. Cave-in. It's no use, in a moment or two, the whole thing comes down. Rian. Rian. Rian. Rian. Rian. - Rian. - Vic. Vic, get back. - The whole thing will go in a minute. - Rian. Vic. Vic. Get back, you fool, you'll never make it. Can you breathe at all? Vic, you fool, get back man. Now. - When I lever, push up as hard as you can. - Alright. Now. Try it again, push up as hard as you can. - Now. - It's coming, it's coming Vic. Come on. Vic, come on. Straighten it up, put your weight on it. - How is it feel? - It's alright. - I don't think anything is broken. - Ah, except one slightly fractured mountain. Hey, I can do with a drink. - Incidentally Vic, thanks. - If you going to cry, I'll wait outside. Here. We got no time to cry, we got plans to make. What's the rush? The boat won't leave for a week. Who's talking about leaving? The mountain wants to play rough, we'll play rough. Rip it apart, we'll step-dig. I'll tear that whole mountain down. Step-dig? With what we got left we couldn't cut butter. Well, we'll find a way. If you thinking about a mining syndicate, they wouldn't... touch this operation with a barge pole. I know, I know but Vic, we almost had our hands on them. I can taste those emeralds, nothing is going to stop me now, nothing. Just give me time to think. Rian... I heard the news Rian, tough luck. Well, that's how it goes. You can't win them all. What are your plans now? Well, it's only one thing left to do, step-dig. I thought you said that was an expensive operation. Yes, well, I'm just on my way to the village to get a message off to a mining syndicate. Mind you, they'll want everything excepting our teeth. - When you're slicing up a king's ransom... - There's enough for everyone. Well, it's a pity in a way, might've been a great chance... for someone with a taste for adventure. A man who'd gamble on the big payoff. Ah but they're a vanishing race these days. - Well, I better be on my way. - Wait a minute Rian. Look kid, I'm in a bit of a hurry, will you keep till I get back from the village? Maybe there's no need to go to village. - I, I don't get you. - If you didn't have to go to the syndicate. I mean, if you found someone who'd take the gamble. What kind of an arrangement would you be willing to make? Well Vic and I aren't greedy, anything within reason but what's the point. - Where do we find this Mr. X? - You're looking at him. - You? - Why not? You say there are emeralds up there, that's good enough for me. Oh, I don't know. Oh, naturally, we'd like to have you in with us but... well, we'd probably need more money than you could lay your hands on. - More than 5000? - I'm afraid so. Mining equipment runs pretty high these days but thanks all the same. - Would 10,000 do it? - Ten thousand? Well, anyone who put in that amount would certainly be entitled to his share. Then it's a deal. - Wait a minute, wait a minute. - What's wrong? We're forgetting the most important thing of all, labor. I couldn't begin to step-dig without at least 200 men. And I understand from you, you got them all tied up for the harvest. Well, we better forget the whole thing, I'll... dump the labor problem in the syndicate's lap. Pity, thought we had a great idea there for a second. I'll get the men for you Rian, all of them. It's a pretty drastic decision kid, what will Cathy say? Frankly, she won't like it. But the plantation is in my name, I make the decisions. Cathy knows how I feel. I've tried her way for five years and the place is broken our backs. Of course, you could make it up to her a 100 times over when we make our strike. It'd be hard for a women to stay mad when she's looking at a handful of emeralds. Well, don't you worry about Cathy, I can handle her. All you got to do is say the word. - It's a deal. - I'll have the men up there in the morning. - Good luck partner. - So long Rian. What do you figure? Oh, I think we'd better not continue this cut any further, all this is slide area here. - Reached our limit, eh? - Yeah. But if we make our cut over there and bring the water that way through the sluice... Oh, I don't know. I still don't like the look of this. Señores, someone is coming. It's Cathy. You two must be very proud of yourselves. Cathy, I know what you're thinking but let me explain. I'm not blaming you Don, I'm sure he made it sound very attractive. This was my idea. Cathy, we own a third of the mine. - It's a chance of a lifetime. - What about the harvest? Without the men it'll rot on the trees. But but why these men Cathy? Certainly you can get other men. There are no others. And even if there were, how would you suggest I pay them? Wait a minute... - you mean that ten grand emptied the kitty? - Was all we had. Nice going pal. Oh Don, it's not too late, bring the men back. If you don't, it's the end of everything we've worked for. Cathy, I always said if there was a way out, I'd grab it. For first time in my life, I'm doing something I want to do. You said nothing would change your course, didn't you? I know, I know, I waited til your back was turned, I was ruthless. I said I'd get what I wanted the best way I could. All that may be true but I was not just thinking of myself, this is for all of us. Oh you don't expect me to believe that. Emeralds Cathy, try and think what that means. Once we lay our hands on them, I'll get you 20 plantations. Oh, that's very generous of you but there's only one I want. Oh Cathy, stop thinking like a woman. You fighting a losing battle down there. Why try and hang on there when the rainbow is up here? You're right Rian, I was thinking like a woman. Was thinking of my grandfather and how he hacked a plantation out of the wilderness. And my father who made it his life. And all that's gone into it, love and feeling and pride. Things you wouldn't know about, things you can't buy with your emeralds. - Got quite a sister. - I'm sorry Rian. I really seem to have made a mess of things. Sure kid, it's all your fault. Going to drink all your meals from now on? Been working on a speech in your honor. Tough job, I'm not much of a guy with words. - About all set now. - Let's hear it. Ok. You stink. The second time around pal, you stink. Remember me? Homely philosopher? I'll tell you what your trouble is, you think you can do things your way then... put the pieces together afterward, well, you can't. - You finished? - Finished is right. You're back to one partner pal. Easy boy, easy. - Hi, I guess you wonder what I'm doing here. - A little. Cathy. I don't know a coffee bean from a vitamin pill but... - if I can help in any way... - You don't have to do this, you know. Maybe that's why I'm doing it. What you got to lose? Only cost you room and board. Ok, you're hired. Oh Vic, we're not beaten yet, tomorrow Father Ripero is going to get all the... It's alright, keep going, I heard every word. Come on, I'll tell you the rest over some coffee, Knowland brand, black. Look Cathy, there's something else I'd like to get off my chest before I sober up. It's about you Cathy, I... well that is, I, I feel differently than I ever thought I could feel. Well, that is, I... Well, like I said to someone earlier today, who shall remain nameless, I... I'm not much of a guy with words. Do you get what I mean Cathy? That's the way to make a speech, no words at all. I'll have that coffee now. Señorita, señorita. Not as many as I'd hoped for. Don't you worry Cathy, we'll make it. I'm sorry Catherine, these are all that could be spared. But they say what 200 men can do, they can do better. - Four hundred men. - The Padre is right. Such faith has been known to work miracles. We're counting on that Father but just for insurance, give us a prayer with muscles. Manuel, I think they ready. Give a warning and let her go, eh? Yes patron. Rian, I found them. Rian, I got them. - Get back. - Rian. Donald. Donald. Looks like I'm stuck in one place after all. I found them Rian. I found an emerald, it paid off. Tell, tell Cathy it paid off. Amen. Amen. Grant, we beseech thee, almighty God, that the soul of thy servant Donald... may receive everlasting rest. To the Earth which he dug and from which he came, is he now returned. Cathy, I... It's all yours now Rian. Patron, patron, patron, patron. - What do you want? - Forgive me patron. Manuel, didn't I tell you to get these two cots out of here days ago? - Yes but... - Well, get them out. - But, patron, I... - Go on, beat it. - What is it? - This. Have I earned my bonus patron? - Where you find it? - Where señor Knowland was digging. Come on. - It was the only one patron. - Yeah. Now, tell the boys to keep digging. Cut away this whole section. There's sure to be more where this one came from. And tell them there's a bonus for the man who finds a second pocket. Señorita Knowland. - They're changing her course again. - What do you mean again? The river used to flow along the dry wash at the foot of the mountain. - But what moved it in your front yard? - A landslide upstream in grandfather's time. Well, there's another landslide now only this one is man made. Look at this, it's shale from Carrere. Fresh cut timber from Carrere. Keeps coming down that sluice, piling up in the river, the water has to cut around it. - Find a new direction like this. - And we just coming to the rainy season. When that happens, the whole plantation will wind up in the Caribbean. Well, can't we build the levee higher? It wouldn't hold, it's only one thing to do. We'll change the course of the river... send it back along the dry wash where it used to go. - But that's impossible. - Not if we have a landslide of our own. What do you mean? Blow up Carrere. One good push and that whole slide area... be sitting down in the river, in the morning this will be the dry wash. It's up to you Cathy. We can make this hold for the time being. Let's get some coffee bags, get moving, Jose. Catherine, you cannot do this thing. I'm sorry Father but this is one fight I can't win by turning the other cheek. If you destroy the mountain, you will be destroying yourself as well. I'm sorry Father. - Relax Manuel, it's only me. - Señor Leonard, you coming back. - Yeah. - I think maybe it's El Moro. You can't be too careful. - What's that? - What? Let me have your rifle Manuel, your rifle. - Dynamite is still up by the sluice? - Yes señor. Alright. Good morning. I must speak to the guard, letting anybody in these days. - We got business to discuss. - Well, I'm full up on coffee but go ahead. Point one, your sluice changed the course of the river. Point two, comes the rainy season, the whole... plantation will be the biggest swimming pool in Colombia. Point three, I've decided to do something about it. - Like what? - Like point four. Dumping this whole chunk of real estate down in the river. Fascinating idea. Drop it in the suggestion box on your way out. The suggestion box is packed with dynamite up in the slide area. Right now, Jose is waiting on the top step. Two minutes after he presses the plunger... this whole shebang is going up like the Fourth of July. I suppose you've thought of dumping 200 men into the river at the same time. Oh, about that Cathy is giving the boys their pink slips now. Sounds like they're on their way back to the coffee picker's union. Get back. Get back, you... Get back. Go on, get... Patron, patron, the mountain, they have used all the dynamite, I couldn't hold the men. - Jose ready? - He's waiting for your signal. You see Cathy? We're not so different after all. We're both gutter fighters when we want something badly enough. That's right pal. Now let's get our seats for the big show. - You forgot one thing. - What's that? Point five, I'm staying here. Are you crazy? This whole camp is taking a trip. I know that, don't mind me. You go right ahead with your Fourth of July. You're going to get off this mountain if I have to carry you off. It'll be that way or not at all. Vic, stop it. Vic, stop it. That's enough. Thought the only answer was to fight back your way. And I find I don't like it down here in the gutter. I'm sorry Vic, I, I can't go through with it. But Cathy, look what's coming up over there. When that gets here, you'll be out of business. I don't care, nothing is worth having this way. Ok Rian, all of a sudden it's the fifth of July. Jose, disconnect the detonator and come on back. Si señor. Vic, I'd like to talk to you. We've had it pal, we got nothing to say to each other. - Only take a second. - Ok. About the mountain, think maybe you got a point. Go ahead, blow it up. - Are you kidding? - No, I'm all out of tricks. Oh, what do you know? - El Moro, señor Leonard, it is El Moro. - Stay there. - El Moro and his men, over there. - Come on, come on. Go on, get inside, first aid kits over there. Picked a fine time to fire everybody. - Señor Mitchell, can you hear me? - I hear. I told you I will come back when you find the emeralds. Now, we will do business my way. - What's your deal? - First, throw away your guns and come out. I know the señorita is there. Come out and she will not be hurt. Do not trust him señor. We have a wounded man here. Let the señorita get him to safety and then we'll talk. We will talk first. That's what I thought, we better make a break for it. - Too much open ground to cover. - What is it señor Mitchell? Let's see if I can pick him off. - That was you very stupid answer. - Get down. What you doing? Look, where exactly did you plant that detonator? - Oh, it's up there by the sluice but... - Cover me. I'm going to try to make my way up there. If you're thinking of blowing him off the mountain... that won't work, the whole camp goes with it. I know but I can keep him pinned down from there. Give you all a chance to get to the horses. - That still leaves you up there. - I'll have two minutes. The second I see you go, I'll set off that detonator and get out fast. - Without covering fire you're a clay pigeon. - You got a better suggestion? Yeah, why you? - You are no gazelle. - Ok. There's so many things I'd like to say Cathy. Hey, about that timer, you quite sure it is two minutes? - When I say two minutes, I mean on the dot. - Alright, I'm just checking. You ready? He's made it. - Go, go. - Alright, let's go.
