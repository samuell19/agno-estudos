[BICYCLE BELL JINGLING] [DOG BARKING] [DOG WHIMPERING] [PLAYING PIANO] [LOUD MUSIC BLARING] Excuse me! Could you please turn your so-called music down? Hello? ♪ ♪ I'm all right ♪ I'm all right ♪ I'm all right Hello? Grandmother, please! -It's too loud! -[MUSIC TURNS OFF] It's rock 'n' roll, sweetheart. -It's never too loud. -[LOUD MUSIC PLAYING] I can't hear myself think. That's exactly why it was invented. -[MUSIC TURNS OFF] -Don't you think you're overdoing it? Honey, at my age, being able to overdo is more important than being able to do. [PANTING] You're not exactly, Jurassic. Thank you, sweetheart. Like or not, things change. They still want to close the school? Enrollment's down, repair bill's up. We either raise enough money to meet the state matching funds or it's all over. As soon as something gets old, nobody sees the beauty in it anymore. I'm depressing myself. Is this about saving the school or preventing Sue Ellen Caldwell from developing the property? Just because that woman has been trying to get the best of me since I was your age, does not mean that... There is a principle behind this. She is a mean, selfish, rich, bully-snob, and I'm gonna get her if it's the last thing I do. At least it's not personal. Don't you have school? You're the one who's gonna be late. Dad's back from DC. He's dropping me off. -Now change! -[SCOFFS] [CHUCKLES] PATTY: Patty Lane, one small woman fighting the mighty for the rights of the little guy. You go, girl! Now I'm really depressing myself. [THE PATTY DUKE SHOW THEME SONG PLAYING] Hey, dad. Read your story in this morning's paper. Do you realize that you used the phrase "alleged cover-up" five times? Only five times? I guess that's why they consider me pro-administration. [LAUGHING] Mom called from Auckland. Her story's keeping her there through next week. Between her schedule and mine... BOTH: It's a miracle we got together long enough to have you. You've heard that one, huh? -A few times. -[DOOR OPENING] MARTIN: Hello? Hello? Grandma! Grandpa! How are you? Good to see you. -Need a hand, Ross? -No, I got it. Thanks. -How was your flight? -Fine. If you don't mind sitting in the last row next to the bathroom, watching all those desperate people. [ALL LAUGHING] Senior citizen seats are the next best thing to sitting on the wings. Is Patty hip to what's happening yet? No. Totally clueless. She's gonna freak when she finds out. I can't wait to tell her. Natalie, it's supposed to be a surprise. Telling your mother a secret is like putting it on the internet. Dad! Mom! Honey! Oh! What a good surprise! [GASPING] What are you doing here? Oh, we were so excited when we heard the news, we had to be here for... Alumni week. Oh. Why? Oh, well, um, we knew how important this week was to you. Ah, well, you guys are the greatest. I gotta get to school. You gonna be okay here? Oh, we have plenty to do. Ah, look up old friends... Spend our meager pension shopping for things your mother simply can't live without. Ah, way to go, mommo! All right, see you later. -I think we did it. -[SIGHS] Hey, you guys, I know you're up to something, and I'm gonna figure out what it is. I always do. Bye. A wasted career. She would've been great in the CIA. So when's cousin Cathy arriving? They got grounded in Nova Scotia. They're not gonna be here till late this afternoon. Oh, yeah, you know, I'd like a strong black cup of coffee over here, Marge. By Jiminy. It's been a long layover. Excuse his manners. I'm trying to sound American so when we get there I'll fit right in. We're going to Brooklyn, not North Dakota. [AMERICAN ACCENT] Yo, baby, you dance better than I ever seen. [SCOTTISH ACCENT] No matter where we settle in the states, they'll think I'm a local. I made it clear, Liam. We are going for one week, and then back home. Mom, I can't take Scotland anymore. The only exciting thing that ever happens there is when a cold wind blows someone's kilt into their face. All you know about America is from TV and movies. You'll quickly realize how different things are. You love America, too. I know you miss dad. But it's time. You need this trip. And so do I. How did I ever get a clever son like you? Genetics, pure and simple. WOMAN: [ON PA] Transworld flight from Edinburgh to New York City is now ready for re-boarding at gate 7. Look out, New York. Here we come. Thanks! Have a good day. You too. [SIGHS] Hi. Yes, fine, I'll take care of it. Thank you. [TELEPHONE RINGING] Morning, Miss Lane. -Mr. Sweeney. -Mmm. The mayor. City council... Still tying up our fax lines with your incessant missives to our elected officials, huh? They have to be reminded that our school is a landmark. Uh-huh. And essential to the survival of our community. Miss Lane, I know you don't enjoy this concept called reality, -but this "landmark" has no heat, -[BELL RINGING] the plumbing is almost non-existent... [SQUEAKY VOICE] Will all students please proceed to their homerooms. SWEENEY: And the PA system makes everybody sound like they ingested helium. We're gonna make a lot of money during alumni week. [SIGHS] A half a million dollars, Miss Lane. Do you really think you can raise that kind of money in one week with a basketball game, a play, and an arts and crafts fair? You left out the celebrity concert and dance. Oh, yes, that's right. The one without the celebrities. All right. So not everybody has confirmed. I'm working on it. You also forget we have a lot of wealthy alums who can potentially write big checks. Miss Lane, what you're talking about is basically impossible. I love starting with the basics. Okay. Before we start the rehearsal, we're gonna do an acting warm-up exercise. Everybody on your feet. Let's go. Come on. All right. We're going to use creative imagery. Close your eyes... Separate. [ALL LAUGHING] And no sleeping. Now feel your body expand... [ALL LAUGHING] Fill the space. Fill the room. Fill the school. Fill Brooklyn. Don't fill the hallways. [ALL LAUGHING] And Miss Lane rules! Yeah, well, let's make sure she keeps her job. We only have three days left to pull Romeo and Juliettogether. Let's start with act two, scene one. Scene two. Tiffany? Anthony? Tiffany? ALL: Whoo-hoo! Could we save that for the scene? Sorry, Miss Lane. Begin. Yo, Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou, Romeo? Deny thy father and refuse thy name. [TELEPHONE RINGING] No one's at home. They must not have got the message that we switched planes and got in early. Now what? Now we take a taxi and surprise Patty at school. This wall is gone. These moldings, they all got to go. And that, whatever that is, that's definitely gotta go. It's so old. Old can be nice, Liam. Sometimes. Uh, good afternoon, everyone. This will be a difficult... Excuse me, Miss O'Halloran... Be a difficult meeting, I'm afraid. We have to deal with the real possibility that come next semester, this school will close. All the students will be dispersed to other schools, and unfortunately, many of you will be let go. On the upside, some of you are eligible for early retirement. This is outrageous! Where's Patty? Hey! Who authorized you people to be in here? All we are doing, lady, is a structural feasibility study for Mrs. Caldwell, all right? SWEENEY: If there are no other questions... Ah, Miss Lane. Finally decided to join us, hmm? Excuse me? Yeah, please. Could you kindly take a seat so we can continue. Oh, I'm not... Miss Lane, please! Thank you. Now. Although this facility will cease to exist as a school, it will not be demolished. [CLEARS THROAT] To explain, a community leader and developer, Sue Ellen Caldwell. [APPLAUSE] -Yes, so I've got... -Yes, thank you. Yes, thank you. Well... Good afternoon, friends. First of all, I would like to thank principal Sweeney for asking me here today so that I might have this opportunity to explain to you all exactly what's going on. Therefore, I am pleased to announce that I have signed a tentative agreement to buy this property, but only in the event that the school is unable to raise the money necessary to keep this place going as an institute of learning. Now not to worry! I have no intention of destroying this edifice, only modifying its function. Slightly. Mrs. Caldwell doesn't own this building. The city does. That's never stopped Mrs. C before, right, boys? [LAUGHING] Yeah, well, it's gonna this time. You are trespassing. Please leave. Hey! Put down those blueprints! We got a job to do here, all right? Fine. Do it someplace else. You can't do that! Uh-oh. SUE ELLEN: The Brooklyn Heights Mall will retain this beautiful structure. And in keeping with our school's reputation for excellence, we'll have only the finest retail merchants in the business. Names like, Luggage World, Vickie's nighties, and the Roger Corman Studio Store. -Hey! -MAN: I've heard enough. You're our representative, Patty. Everybody's counting on you. -But I'm not... -Yes, Miss Lane? MAN: Miss Lane, please. Well, I... -I think... -Yes. Go! I just think that what you're proposing is disgusting. [ALL APPLAUDING] MAN: Good point, Patty. When our institutions no longer matter, we no longer matter. MAN: Hear, hear! For they have formed the way we look at the world. Oh, please. This school hasn't just shaped a neighborhood. It has shaped the way a neighborhood sees itself. Mrs. Caldwell is not going to be happy about this. Mrs. Caldwell hasn't been happy since she evicted a building full of senior citizens in a blizzard. After you. My meeting! Excuse me! Pardon me! If we turn our backs on Brooklyn Heights high, we turn our backs on ourselves. [ALL APPLAUDING] [INDISTINCT] Sue Ellen! [SIGHS] Well, you haven't learned, have you, Patty? When you go up against me, you always lose. Should have stuck with the other outfit, thrift store girl. Why couldn't I listen to Pablo and learn to value of thrift? Thrift... That's it. I'll go to the thrift shop. I'm sure to find a gown there. -It's me. -It is lovely. You're lucky. It came in just a little while ago. Oh? So you went to the thrift shop and bought my old dress? I did not! Well, I didn't know it was your dress. Please, Sue, promise me you won't tell anybody. Please? Promise? Buddy, pal, friend... Hmm, of course not. I'd be an utter monster to. You made us proud, Patty. I like your hair back better. [GASPING] Cathy! -Patty! -You look great! [SIGHS] [LAUGHTER] Oh, I still can't believe you guys are here. You know the last time I saw you, you barely came up to my waist. And so handsome. I prefer hip, cool, out of sight. Oh. You got it. I told mom if she didn't come, I'd fed-ex myself in a box, like I did to London. You went to London in a box? Actually, it broke when they were loading me in the truck in Glasgow. That sounds like something our Patty might have done. Is it cool to show Liam my room? Of course. Here's a scary thought. It's the same room your mom and my grandma used to share. I didn't know families in America kept the same house from one generation to the next. Well, the previous owners made me an offer I couldn't refuse. The monthly rent check keeps her mother in lottery tickets. [ALL LAUGHING] Mom, I can do that. So can I. And so can your father. This is one of the disadvantages of retirement. You retire to have nothing to do. So why does everyone think you need to do something? All right, all right, it's just a question. I didn't expect an answer. Please say something to your mother. Oh... [GIGGLING] They haven't changed. They've gotten worse. Gee, I'm sorry I haven't called you much lately. Oh, things have been so hectic at school. I'm afraid I've become a bit of a hermit since Colin died. Well, let's face it, Cath. You never were much of a party animal. My world revolves around Liam now. He keeps me quite busy. Yeah, I know what you mean. Michael and Nancy are usually off chasing a story and Molly lives here more than she does at her own house. And I love it. It's a little sad, thinking of them grown up and not needing us anymore. They'll always need us, Cath. Then when we're really old, we'll check into the same nursing home, and give them a run for their money. [CHUCKLES] You should have seen Sue Ellen's face when I was making that speech. She could have killed me... You. Yeah, well, she's lucky it wasn't me. I wouldn't have been so polite. It's like old times. People mixing us up... Do you have any idea what a weapon we have on our hands? What do you mean? Separately, we're two girls who have a few talents. Just like anyone else. You're a brain. I like sports. You like opera. I like to dance. But together, we're really on the beam. On the beam? With it. We can be in two different places at the same time. Do you think we could really fool people, Patty? Let's find out. How? Any objections? Not in the least. [ENGLISH ACCENT] I think I will descend below and inquire how Aunt Natalie and dear Uncle Martin are getting along. [BOTH LAUGHING] That we did. Hmm. MOLLY: That's Stone Adams. He's my favorite actor. I wouldn't mind having his luck with the babes. My grandma taught him English and drama. That's radical. You know, I've always loved things American. I'd love to see Scotland. I'd love to see anywhere that isn't Brooklyn. You're mad! Brooklyn, as they say in the local vernacular, is the grenade. Do you mean, the bomb? That, too. MOLLY: Save our school. Five bucks a chance. You win a motor scooter. Only five bucks. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] [BOYS WHISTLING] Way to go, guys! Yeah! I told you this place would be a morgue. Yes, you did, Normann. But I still don't want to take the chance that by some pathetic accident, Patty's able to raise the money. So I want to put all our contingency plans into effect. You know what to do, Normann. What happened to all the fans? Makes no sense. Paper said it was gonna be a sell-out. Well, a lot of people are coming from out of town. Maybe they got stuck in traffic. I can't sit here anymore. Popcorn anyone? Lots of salt, extra butter. -Cherry coke? -No ice. [AMERICAN ACCENT] Yo! What's up? Wanna party? Not with you. You're not exactly helping me here. I've always been able to draw a crowd. This is how we do it back home. [SCOTTISH MUSIC PLAYING] [ONLOOKERS CLAPPING TO MUSIC] [ALL CHEERING] -Look. You did good. -Cool. Told you. Thank you. Ahh! Oh! Careful, Patty, careful. The cleaning bill for this outfit would cost more than your entire wardrobe. That's because they charge double for extra smells. Ooh, I'm so glad we've managed to stay enemies all these years. I thrive on the tension, don't you? This is your alma mater as much as it is mine. Why do you want to destroy it? Patty, Patty, Patty. It's old. Its time has come and gone. A little like you, dear. Wow. You know, I love Brooklyn. I'm totally happy for you, but I didn't sell one ticket. What? You got a customer right here. I'll take $30 worth. [CAR HORN HONKING] Hey, Richard! -Patty... -Richard, I need a favor. Stop me before I commit justifiable homicide. Sue Ellen. You can't let her get to you. The woman is miserable. She's been married five times. So, she's been with four more men than I have. [CHUCKLES] I'm not that far ahead of you. After all, we were married for 27 years. Are you still seeing, um, what's-her-name? Rebecca? Nah, she wore too many hats. I think I saw her hair maybe, uh, twice. Are you dating? I met someone on the internet. Really? I finally got the courage to meet him. He was old enough to be my dad's dad. Good typist, though. Thanks. For helping with the set. Patty, I... We're gonna keep the school going, somehow. Thanks. [GRUNTING] Ugh! [SCREAMS] Oh! Oh! Oh! [CHUCKLING] Patty? Oh! Hi, Cath. I didn't hear you come in. I just needed some down time. The old room looks different, but somehow it's still the same. Kind of like us. Uh, pardon, me. Am I interrupting? Yeah. Well, anyhow... Michael and I got talking about the strange turnout tonight. So I did some digging. Digging? I may have retired, but the newspaperman inside me didn't. I asked around, and guess what? Somebody hacked into the computerized ticket system. Whenever anybody tried to buy tickets for the game, the computer showed that it was sold out. You don't want that to happen at the art fair. So the question is, who in their right mind would want to sabotage you that way? Well, I know who. But the last word I'd use to describe her mind is right. She wouldn't. Who else? Well, what are we going to do? "We"? You don't think I'm going to let you be the only hero. [GIGGLING] [INDISTINCT] Molly... I've been thinking, and I'm not advocating this, I'm just saying that I bet a person who's good with computers could beat Sue Ellen at her own dirty game. You think? -I'm in. -Good. Sue Ellen Caldwell, daily calendar. She'll be pushing up daisies by the time we're through. Oh, hi, Ross. So, you're the reason why Patty's tried on every dress she has. She's nervous about your date. It's not a date. She called and asked if I'd come to the arts and crafts fair. Sounds like a date to me. Hey, Natalie, let's go. -ROSS: Come on, we're gonna be late. -Watch this. One, two, three... NATALIE: I can't find my earring. Check your ear. In 55 years, she has yet to leave anywhere without looking for something. How did you know where it was? Lucky guess. Oh. -Whoa! Killer dress! -[ALL APPLAUDING] -Beautiful. -Nice. Thank you. It was Colin's favorite. You look beautiful, dear. Thank you, Aunt Natalie. I feel like I just called everyone in the known world. Mom's gonna be so surprised when she... Surprised about what? Whoa! Oh, I'm not sure. The only thing holding it up is a fervent prayer. All right, what surprise? Come on, come on, you guys. Every time I come in a room you clam up. What is it? I made Cathy's dress. What? Uh, she hasn't been out in a long time, and so I thought I would make something for her. Mom, you can't sew. -Oh, yes she can. She made me this tie. -Uh-huh. Big shock, huh? Took a course. Richard, why don't we go in the den. Oh. Listen, Richard, I can see you still care about Patty. Why don't you tell her? She thinks of me as a friend or a brother. We were too young when we got married, and now, we're too old. No. I've been married over fifty years. Trust me. Love does not recognize age. Took me a lot of years to get over the divorce. I've finally gotten used to being alone. Are you enjoying it? Pain is not something you wear like a badge of courage, Richard. Happiness is. Give that some thought. PATTY: Richard, I'm ready to go. [INDISTINCT TALKING] Martin, don't you think this would work in our bedroom? Sure, if we never want to fall asleep. [GASPS] There's Stone Adams' cousin! She can tell me how to get in touch with Stone. Is everything all right, Mrs. C? No, Normann, as a matter of fact, I spent a day in the depths of hell. I waited an hour for my bankers at lunch. They never showed. Then my dental appointment to fix my abscessed tooth, which is killing me, was canceled. And the topper, I take my jag in for service, and the dealer's records show that I haven't made any payments. So they repossess it. Did you check your astrological chart? Because sometimes... Shut up! What is this? You were supposed to empty this dump before anybody had a chance to spend a dime! Yes, ma'am, I was. Well, do it, Normann. -Now! -[STOMPS FOOT] Oh, goodness. Guess who's coming your way? I got the Queen O'Mean, in sight. Psst! Psst! Ross! She's coming. Thank you. Have you sold many of these? Whoa! Hello, Sue Ellen. Oh, Well, hello, Mr. Lane. So nice to see you supporting the school. Oh. Well, as a community leader, I do have a certain sense of civic duty. Your father must be very proud. -Daddy? -We still stay in touch. Shall we get some punch and chat? Well, actually... Oh, all right. [HISSING] How did it go with Stone Adams' cousin? Well, it seems that she once sold his phone number to the National Enquirer, so he doesn't keep in touch. [CHUCKLING] Oh! There's that investment banker guy! He is loaded. He's always good for... Who is Stone Adams? Well, he's an actor. He's actually quite famous. I don't think you would have seen the kinds of movies he makes, though. Oh? Those kinds of movies? And Patty knows him? Oh! No, grandma. Not those kinds of movies. And, uh, mom knows him because when he was in high school, he was in her class. Well, I better rent some of his movies and check out his talents. Grandma... Well, it's been awfully nice, but I really do have to meet someone. Of course. Sue Ellen, you look hot tonight. What do you want? You know, I had this huge crush on you in high school, and it's never really gone away. Want some oysters? I'm pretty sure that Normann guy can tell you the scoop on the construction scandal. That's pretty heavy illegal stuff. You think he was responsible? Maybe. In fact, most probably. My editor would be pretty impressed if I could break that story for the paper. I'm gonna find that Normann, see if I can sweat the details out of him. Like it? Very much. I don't think I did her justice. Are you the artist? -Rock? -[CHUCKLING] Hello, Cathy. But I haven't used "Rock" since our high school days. It's Hank now. -Hank. -Hank. What are you doing here? I heard you'd moved back to the south of France. Oh, no. I've been living here for years now. That one year as an exchange student changed my life. I knew there was something familiar about this piece. Well, it should be familiar. She's you. You're the one that got away. The one I couldn't forget. [EXHALES] It was wonderful. [LAUGHTER] No kidding? What happened? There was a new boy there tonight. He's the most handsome, wonderful, intelligent man I have ever seen. You're exactly as I remembered you. Your face still has the same luminous quality. Every expression is a direct conduit to your soul. My, you're good. Tell me, do you look these things up in a book or do you just make them up on the spot? Hey, I'm being totally sincere here. Oh. As a matter of fact, your face has gotten even more radiant. Ah, well, wrinkles, they reflect the light. [DRIPPING] See what you do to me? I'm sweating here. You never said a word. You were always the coolest chap in school. Actually, I wasn't cool. I was shy. Painfully shy. Mmm. Me, too. Did you ever know that Patty and I both had a crush on you? Wait a minute. Weren't the two of you always after the same guy? Oh, well, that did happen sometimes. I saw him first, you double-crossing boy-snatcher! He's mine! That's ridiculous! He asked me for a date tomorrow night! Oh, sure. After you cornered him and forced him to! LIBRARIAN: Shh! You told me he was intellectual and not very good looking! That's the way I saw him! You told me he was an athlete and handsome! That's the way I saw him. You have Richard. I'll trade you Richard and two Beatle albums. LIBRARIAN: Shh! BOTH: Shh! ROSS: I'm so glad I had a chance to tell you all this, but I've gotta head for the great white way. But, call me sometime. Oh, Sue Ellen! I've been trying to get over here to talk to you all evening. Oh, Mrs. Lane. My, don't you look wonderful. It's all about diet and exercise. Let me tell you my regimen. Desiccated liver morning, noon, and night. Oh, you must try it. Would you excuse me, please? Oh. Well, of course. Of course. Can we talk? Excuse me. Not such a good night, Sue Ellen? Look, Patty, this has gotten all out of hand. Now, I'm ready to be reasonable. Ooh, I'm all for that. All right, how about this. You back off, and maybe I can add a few zeroes to your pension fund. Oh, please... Drumroll, please! [IMITATING DRUMROLL] Oh, read 'em and weep, Sue Ellen! -[ALL LAUGHING] -Hey, all right! -Congratulations, sweetheart. -Oh, let's go home. Tomorrow is another day. I thought everything went very well. LIAM: This has been a blast. MOLLY: Yeah, it has. LIAM: Look at this! TIFFANY: Anthony! -Uh-oh. -MAN: Anthony? ALL: Anthony! You day-glow maggot! I thought you were home sick. I got better? Oh, yeah, you got better. That's it. We're through. -Oh, yeah? -I wouldn't date you if you were the last freak on earth, you worm! What do I care if you date me? Okay, okay. We can work this out. No, no. I'm sorry, Miss Lane. I just can't work with him. You can't work with me? I can't work with you. No, you can't quit. The play is tomorrow. I'm sorry. It would be just too painful to do the play now. Even with a different Romeo. You maggot! I didn't know you had a girlfriend. -No, she ain't my... -Get lost, Maggot. Anthony, you're still gonna be in the play, right? No. If Tiffany won't do it, I won't do it. Hey, I can feel just as much pain as she can. Thank you, Aunt Sue Ellen. Your welcome, Hillary darling. You put that in your college fund. Isn't there anybody else? Who can learn the whole play in 24 hours and act? Well, one out of two wouldn't be bad. PATTY: Ah, it's hopeless. We have to cancel the play. Uh, but couldn't you play the part of Juliet, Miss Lane? [CHUCKLING] Great idea! People love to see faculty make fools of themselves. Oh, thank you, dear, for your vote of confidence. But I think not. Patty, not even to save the school? I'd like to see you again. Oh, I don't think that would be possible. Am I coming on too strong? I'm only going to be here a few days, and... I haven't dated anyone for twenty years. Well, don't look at it as a date. Look at it as spending time with the coolest guy in high school. [CHUCKLING] And anyway, if you're only going to be here a short while, then there's nothing to be afraid of, is there? Hank, you don't know me. Even when you knew me, you didn't know me. I didn't know me. Always a gentleman. Thank you. It's been lovely seeing you again. I'm going to call you tomorrow. Try to change your mind. I can't deny that your persistence is flattering. Good night, Hank. Good night. Well, you ready for the pep talk? I read somewhere that the same year that Babe Ruth hit all the home runs, he also struck out the most. To hit the ball, you gotta swing the bat. Yeah, but sometimes, you can swing as hard as you want and you can't get a hit. Hank Aaron batted .175 during a season, and then in the world series he was batting .465. Anybody can have a slump. Well, at least I know what to call it now. Patty, maybe you've taken on more than it's humanly possible. So you want me to quit? Oh, I'm not saying that. I'm only... Are you just telling me that when the going gets tough, the tough... When the tough go get... Something like that. I'm just saying... You're trying to talk me out of everything I believe in. Everything I've dedicated my life to. Patty, you're the one that doesn't want to do the play. I can remember a time when you would have leaped into that spotlight. Yes, well, I no longer have the childish need for attention and accolades. I better go in. I have a long sleepless night ahead of me. Oh, thanks. Well, good night. And thanks, coach, for the pep talk. You know, I've just about decided that I'm not gonna get involved with the opposite sex again. Oh. Me, too. Right, right with you. Yeah... It'd be crazy after all these years. Absolutely. Completely nuts. Good. We agree. Yeah. Good night. 'Night. PATTY: Oh, Richard. RICHARD: Oh, Patty. Isn't it all, you know... -Gonesville? -Yeah. I feel all spooky inside. -Like... -Me, too. Like... What's the matter? My foot fell asleep. Oh. Rich... Do you suppose anybody ever felt this way before? How could they? I suppose maybe Romeo and Juliet. Maybe. Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou, Romeo? Friends, romans, countrymen, lend me your ears. Romeo said that? -Well, maybe it was Hamlet. -Hmm. Well, mom, I've decided. I'm gonna play Juliet. That's wonderful, dear. Who's going to play Romeo? Someone I've acted with before. RICHARD: Good morning. Anybody home? I brought donuts and bran muffins. Good choice, dear. What? Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou, Romeo? It's a great turnout. I can't wait to see Richard Harrison in tights. MOLLY: Two minutes, everyone! Places... Places, two minutes! Where are Romeo and Juliet? On their way. I am so nervous. Take deep breaths. Like this. [BREATHING HEAVILY] Come on. What are you doing? See? It works. Who knows? I can't feel a thing from the brain down. It's show time. Show time. Oh, boy. You're gonna be great. Breathe. [BREATHING FAST] All right, stop breathing. You're gonna hyperventilate. My grandparents... Romeo and Juliet. ♪ [INDISTINCT] House lights out. Curtain. [APPLAUSE] Two households, both alike in dignity, in fair Verona, where we lay our scene, where ancient grudge breaks to new mutiny and civil blood makes civil hands unclean. SUE ELLEN: Ah, stupid curtain, get out! I'm gonna kill that little weasel when I get my hands around his neck. From forth the fatal loins of these two foes a pair of star-crossed lovers... Take their life... [APPLAUSE] And misadventure's piteous overthrows, doth with their death bury their parents' strife. Exit. Go! Fade out. Go! What lady is that which doth enrich the hand of yonder knight? MERCUTIO: I know not, Romeo. Ah, she teaches the torches to burn bright. It seems she hang upon the cheek of night. Did my heart love till now? Forswear it, sight! For I have... [APPLAUSE] I have never seen true beauty till this night. What's happening to her? Stage fright. My lips, two blushing pilgrims... She's the drama teacher. She's a teacher, not an actor. I thought she'd gotten over this. If Patty gets that part, she's gonna be impossible. Well, perhaps she won't get it. What do you mean? Do you remember what happened the last time she tried out for a school play? Sure. She froze up and... She froze up. She froze up. Come in. Mr. Gregory? [AUDIENCE CHEERING] Hello, Susan. Sit down. And as soon as she learned she didn't have to go on, her voice came back. Great. So all we have to do is convince her that there's no audience out there, and she'll be fine. RICHARD: Two pilgrims, ready to smooth the rough touch with a simple kiss. [LAUGHTER] Good lady, you do enhance your hand too much. Be that I struck you dumb with my presence? Uh, may that I, uh, speak for thee... Good pilgrim... Good pilgrim! You do wrong your hand too much. Good pilgrim! MERCUTIO: Romeo! Cousin Romeo! Er, Romeo... RICHARD: Ho, good Mercutio! MERCUTIO: Madman, passion, lover... What on earth are you doing? You were supposed to wait for me downstairs. It's too dangerous. I overheard a couple of guys talking at the art fair. Now they want to question me about the community center thing. No, you idiot! Those men were probably from Patty Lane's family! She has more relatives than the cast of Chicago Hope. She's related to Christine Lahti? Why do I put up... Once again you have screwed up. The sprinkler system was supposed to be leaking water onto the stage before this fiasco began! Do you really think this is a fiasco? 'Cause I've been watching, and it is very funny. Look! -[CHUCKLING] -Just stop it... -Romeo... -[AUDIENCE LAUGHING] Ho, good Mercutio. Humors, passion, lover! Time for another pep talk. The show must go on. I know you can do it. [GASPING] I can't. The whole school is counting on you. I can't do it. MERCUTIO: Romeo? PATTY: How much longer are you gonna let fear run your life? But soft, what light from yonder window breaks? It is the east and Juliet... [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] And also Julia, her sister... Are the sun! Ah, me. Ah, me, too. RICHARD: They speak. Oh, speak again, bright angel! SUE ELLEN: Well, here's your problem. You forgot to pull the lever. [SCREAMING] [AUDIENCE GASPING] [GASPS] Even thy mother tries to stop me. Be gone now! I cast thee out! [APPLAUSE] Oh! Thank you. [ALL CHEERING] Oh, thank you. Thank you. Oh, well done. PATTY: Whoa! Oh, never again, never again. I thought I was gonna die. Ha-ha! You were great! It was a sellout. They loved you. We do this kind of business at the celebrity concert and dance, you may just turn Mr. Sweeney into a believer. Yes! Thanks, Miss O'Halloran. NATALIE: Patty! Oh, darling! -You were the most wonderful. -Oh, mommo. Oh, I was ridiculous! You were the best. Absolutely beautiful. Wasn't Richard fabulous? He said all those words... It's not over until the fat lady sings. Then you'd better call your vocal coach. Hey, hon. Mind if I join you? I'm starving. Sure, pop-o. Oh, boy, pie. What's the matter, couldn't sleep? Mmm-mmm. Neither could I. I keep running this Sue Ellen thing over and over in my mind. I bet we're not the only ones losing sleep over that woman. Seems to me that she went to extraordinary lengths to take over the school. Too extraordinary. What do you mean? Well, it's just a hunch, but I'd say she's a little too desperate to make this deal. Like there was something else going on. You're right. Pop-o, could you do a little more digging? See what you can find out? Oh, yeah. You know me, I love a good dig. Thanks, pop-o. It's a good to feel the old juices flowing again. Now, I'd better have a piece of that pie before your mother discovers where I am. [CHUCKLES] Just what I wanted. [TANGO MUSIC PLAYING] What was that? A mistake. [CHUCKLES] At least you're man enough to admit it. -More to come. -Uh-huh. I expect to have a new position on educational spending as soon as I get the report from the subcommittee of the new committee on education exploration. How long this is gonna take... This guy's a riot. Who? Mayor Galliano? Friends, ladies, gentlemen, have a nice day. You're lucky. Our politicians back home couldn't raise a giggle from a hyena. Mmm. You better hide theses in some remote corner of the universe, or there'll be zero left for anyone else. Well, then, doll, you'll just have to whip up another batch. What are you doing? I added a little acid to the pipes so that they would rust and leak a little more quickly. Oh, excellent! Excellent! The inspector's on his way. Oh, Sam, Sam. Thank goodness you're here. Please, Ross. You work on Broadway. You know tons of stars. And they all have to work tomorrow night. Well, you're taking the night off. Why can't some of them do the same? Patty, I'm your brother. They're not. The gym. We have to decorate the gym. Hey, you can't do that. Have to. There's a possible structural problem. Structural problem? Can't it wait? No. This place is a rock. You come to Scotland then I'll show you structural problems. There's never been a structural problem with this gym before. And I'll bet there isn't now. I think the only problem is a big, greedy rat named Sue Ellen. [GASPS] Well, I'm disappointed. Name-calling seems so beneath you. Oh, poor Patty. All the sacrifices you've made for your students, and where has it gotten you? Soon you'll be out of a job, and I'll be a whole lot richer. Okay, that's it! Ah! Ah! Oh, my... Oh! Oh! [GRUNTING] I'm trying to help you. Maybe now you'll get a life. This is temporary! Well, you know how temporary has a habit of turning into permanent. You... [PANTING] All I ever wanted to be was a good teacher. This school is my life. I don't trust that woman. I'm gonna get in touch with a different building inspector, one who's a friend of mine. Can you do that by tomorrow night? No, I can't. Without the dance, we're sunk. I'm not gonna give up. There has to be someplace else that we can hold this gig. Sue Ellen Caldwell will not win. I can't believe every available space in Brooklyn is booked. Well, it is. And we tried everywhere. Maybe Sue Ellen is right. Maybe it's time for me to let go. Hey, hey, hey. Wait a minute, honey. I spent the day searching through Sue Ellen's real estate records down at Borough hall. And did you find out anything? Yeah. If you read fine print all day, it'll give you a headache. I think my glasses are too old. Darling, nothing is too old anymore. Especially now since there's Viagra. [GULPS] [CHUCKLES] Gee, thanks for the vote of confidence, dear. Seriously, mom, grandpa and I are really close to dropping the net on Sue Ellen. She has so many shell corporations and overseas accounts, she's gotta be hiding something. It's just taking us a while to unravel all the levels. You know, Colin was very close to Peter Macnamara at the commerce department. Perhaps he could unravel some red tape if I called him. Oh, that's a great offer, Cath, but it's probably too late. Are you all right? Yeah. Fine. Mom, I'm gonna get it. We have got to tell her what's going on. Her heart is breaking. Too many people are relying on us to keep it a secret. We have to hold on for one more day, all right? I feel sorry for Patty, guilty, I... I can't comfort her, I'm leading her on... I'm pretending and not telling her the truth. PATTY: So that's what this has been? Just a big, fat lie. He really doesn't care at all. Boy, was I stupid! Once again, I've wasted my time! [HARMONICA PLAYING] MOLLY: I don't think keeping this a secret's been such a good idea. My poor grandfather and grandmother. We need to find a place for the celebrity dance, and we have to do it by tonight, or this whole thing's been a waste. I'd trade the whole mess for one of those beauties. One doggie with the works. Can I get a pretzel? Here you go. Wow. Look at that awesome ship. It's the Staten Island ferry. The city stores it here for the winter. It's huge. You think a thousand people could board her? Yes! Come on! Listen, sonny, there's only one guy that can authorize something like this. That's his honor, the mayor. But... End of story. Let's go. Hey! The mayor and I go way back. I'm sure he wouldn't mind. Listen, children, you're now wasting my time. I got a harbor to run here. You don't like the way I do things, call the city. But... You still giving them names? -This one's Fred. -Yeah... That one's Fred. And the twins over there, that's Fred and Fred. And over there... Fred? Good guesser. It's a good name. How'd you find me? Well, when you were little every time you ran away from home, this is as far as you got. [LAUGHING] You always loved this place when you were little. We all run back to the things that made us feel safe and happy when our world sort of falls apart, you know? I thought by now, I'd be as smart as you, and I'd stop making these dumb mistakes. Sweetheart, none of us ever stops making dumb mistakes, and that includes me. Besides, you're at least as smart as me. Patty... I am so proud of the way you've lived your life. It's wonderful. I admit, there was a period there when you were in high school when I used to wonder if we were all gonna survive your schemes, but hey, we made it through. Michael gave me heart failure once a week. With you, it was more like once a day. Oh... What are you doing? Getting our mayor to help us out. [TELEPHONE DIALING] [CELL PHONE RINGING] Hello? -LIAM: [IMITATING MAYOR] Hey, Judson, that you? -Yeah. Who's this? What do you mean, who's this? It's Galli. Mr. Mayor? You got a cold or something'? Right. Look, a kid I know, a Liam MacAllister, he's coming' in to see you. JUDSON: Yeah, he just left. So you let him have the ferry? Well, no. I mean, I thought, you know... Well, don't make me sorry I gave you that job, sonny. Yes, sir. I mean, no, sir. I'll take care of it, sir. [BOTH LAUGHING] You're not just a con artist. You are the king of con artists. You know, Richard was out all night looking for you. Was he? Whatever you thought you heard him say last night, you have to remember, it was Richard talking. He's never been exactly what you'd call an eloquent guy. But, I think he loves you. Maybe. What am I gonna do about the school? Well, that's easy. You just keep fighting, and we'll all be right there with you. Okay? I love you, pop-o. [CHUCKLES] The sweetest words in the world. Now, you ready to pick up your sword and go after that dragon? That's me, Patty the dragon slayer. That's what I wanted to hear. Hey! MOLLY: We found the hottest place for the celebrity dance! We found a place for the dance. It's great! You won't believe it! So all I need from you is one teeny weeny little celebrity. Can't you see that, pop-o? Patty, I'm no Walter Winchell. I don't come in contact with what you call celebrities. You could look through the newspaper and see what celebrities are in town and call them. That's a great idea. You see, she's always thinking. And it says here he's filming a movie in Queens. Stone Adams loves me. He would never let me down if he knew I was in need. So, let him know you're in need. Thanks, pop-o. Cathy? -Pull yourself together! We have to go to Queens! -CATHY: Be right down. Patty! I was worried sick. Can I please talk? Oh, I'm really busy, Richard. Uh, can I help you in any way? Borrow your truck? Oh, thanks. Cathy, hurry up! I'll meet you in the truck! Bye. Okay! Everybody, break it up! Move it inside! You park this thing. I'll find Stone. Hey, lady, where do you think you're going? Oh, it's all right. I was Stone Adams' drama coach in high school. Yeah, sorry. It's a closed set. I assure you, Officer, he'll be thrilled to see me. No one gets in without their name on the list. [CAR HORN HONKING] Just... Hey, back it up! What do you... Wait. Just back it up! Hold on! Lady, if you want to get arrested, tell us now, and save us a lot of time. Please, Officer. I must see Stone Adams. It's crucial. It's crucial that you get yourself a pass or you stay over there. -How did it go? -It didn't. Those cops were all over me. They're never gonna let me in there. I've gotta figure... All right, extras! We're ready to shoot one. I need everybody inside. Come on, come on, move it! You again. What's the matter, you don't understand English? That's just it. I taught Stone Adams English. I thought it was drama. No, actually, it was drama. And English. [INDISTINCT] Everybody, settle down. Are you doing okay? So I whack the gun here, and then he hits me with the chair there? Right, Stone. It's a breakaway. Oh! -Props! -MAN: I'm on it. There we go... -MAN: New chair quick. -Thank you. You, you sit over here... When the fight starts, you move over there. Okay? All right! Lock it up! Here we go! Hit it. All right, people... Gum. Psst! MAN: Gang Land, 14-D, take one. Psst... Psst... Psst... Stone... DIRECTOR: Quiet on the set. Let's go. Settle down, people. I think you dropped a dime on me to the cops. Why would I do that? Because you figure you can run things yourself. Well, I'm not the running things kind of guy. I say, I think you are. [GUN CLICKING] You're not going to kill me here. You got a better place in mind? [CHUCKLES] [GLASS SHATTERING] WOMAN: Cut! Stone? Stone? You okay? You okay? What's going on? This was supposed to be a breakaway. I swear! I got the chair from the extra! WOMAN: Stone, can you hear me? What can cause holes like that? Mice the size of Chihuahuas? -So you see what I mean. -[RUMBLING] Uh, Mrs. Caldwell... Not now, Normann. But... [SCREAMING] It's gonna blow! Can there be any doubt what needs to be done here? Normann, may I speak with you? -[GASPS] What happened? -Don't ask. Just a second, Officer. If you arrest her, you'll have to arrest me. What... There's two of you? Have it your way, lady. Okay. Let's go. PATTY: Thanks for bailing us out. RICHARD: I spoke to the production company. They said they're gonna drop the charges. PATTY: And Stone's okay? Apparently. He said it only hurts when he thinks of you. He hates me. Of course, he'll have to get in line behind all these people after tonight. What am I going to say? Why don't you try the truth? [CHUCKLES] I don't see the rest of the family. They should be here any minute. Good luck. You were supposed to hire a limo for tonight. I'm sorry, Mrs. C, but there still seems to be a problem with your credit cards. No doubt, thanks to Patty and that family of hers. I can hardly wait to see her face when she discovers the news. [LAUGHING] Everyone who bought a ticket actually showed up. And some of them brought those big checks you were looking for. Ah. Well, it's a shame I couldn't find any entertainment for them. Oh. Oh, that is bad news. Uh, would you like to make the announcement yourself? Excuse me... Uh, hi... My name is Patty Lane, and, um... A funny thing happened on the way to the celebrity concert. MAN: Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome award-winning performing artists and BHHS alumni, "The Bomb." ♪ After all these years, after all that's come and gone ♪ We're back, we're back, ♪ After all is said and done we're back ♪ Surprise. Stone! Oh! Oh, watch it, watch it! Injury, injury, injury. Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I can't believe you're here. Well, believe it. It's show time. Follow me. [APPLAUSE] Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention, please? On behalf of the New York city schools, and all of your very grateful former students, I proudly present to you the Clarissa Anthony award. Congratulations. [ALL CHEERING] The Clarissa Anthony award is a lifetime achievement award for teaching. [WHISTLING] Folks, teaching is one of the most important professions there is because teachers are the ones who, who mold our future for all of us. Now we owe a huge debt to Patty Lane, and every other teacher out there, who continually puts the students in the starting position. It is your passion, your inspiration, and your dedication that are all too rare. Thank you, Miss Lane. Thank you for being you. [ALL CHEERING] -I'm speechless. -[ALL LAUGHING] Um... Except to say that this is the best night of my life. And those of you who kept the secret, I know where you live. [ALL LAUGHING] I wouldn't take that threat too lightly, folks. I wouldn't. All right, what do you say we rock this joint, huh? One, two, a-one-two-three-four... [LIVELY MUSIC PLAYING] Let's see this thing. Ah, where is Cathy? Well, she had to take care of some important business. She'll be here, though. Hey, gorgeous. Are you busy, later? Richard... Are you trying to ask me out? Actually, I'm trying to ask you to consider starting over. Unless you feel it's a bad idea... I think it's the best idea I ever heard. Uh, mom, I'd like to read from my column that'll appear in tonight's edition of the New York Sun. "Patty lane is a teacher in Brooklyn who taught her students "to believe in themselves. "Sure, she taught lessons that were required by the state, "but she also taught what was required by the heart. "She said nothing is impossible if you want it bad enough. "And so, they listened, "and they went out into the world. "Thousands of success stories validate her. "And today, "she saved the very school where she taught them because... "Because she wanted it badly enough. "That teacher is my mom. "Thank you for teaching me what's important. "I've never been more proud to be your son." [ALL APPLAUDING] I'm moved. I really am. It's very touching. Almost as touching as the fact that we matched the state funds. Oh, but I'm afraid we're not talking repairs anymore. I won't bore you with the details, but I'm afraid the school must be torn down. You'll notice the word "demolition". And the official city seal. Sue Ellen, if I wasn't a lady... GALLIANO: Hold on, there! It's Mayor Galliano! Hello, Patty. Mr. Mayor. You know my name? You're a difficult woman to ignore. All those faxes and phone calls tying up my staff. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to... Look, a second inspection disputed the original findings at BHHS. So I discussed the problem with the board of education, and convinced them to appropriate the funds to completely renovate Brooklyn Heights High, and place it on the historic register. So you can ignore that demolition order. It's been rescinded. [LAUGHING] Oh! Oh, Mr. Mayor, I don't know how to thank you! I should be thanking you, Patty. One more thing. Who is Liam MacAllister? LIAM: Oh, no... -Uh-oh. -Liam... I want you to come down to City Hall, do your impression of me. We could use a few more laughs down there. [ALL LAUGHING] Have a nice day. Patty, have a nice day. Sir, have a nice day. Have a nice day, everybody. But, Mr. Mayor... Do you see him? Ah, Mr. Mayor, I think you seem to have forgotten my recent contribution to your re-election campaign. As a matter of fact, I didn't. I decided I won't be needing your support. Thanks to Mrs. MacAllister and her friends at the commerce department, I've become aware of your business dealings. It seems you've been signing tenants and taking their money for your mall even though you don't own the building. The district attorney is very interested in talking to you about real estate fraud. There's also the matter of bribing and misleading a city official. Hire a good lawyer, Sue Ellen. You'll need one. -You must be Normann. -Me? I hope she pays you well, because Attica prison is holding a spot for you. Have a nice day. Mrs. MacAllister, I want to thank you for everything. -Thank you. -Gentlemen, carry on! Pick a table. [TANGO MUSIC PLAYING] -This is all your fault. -My fault? I knew I should have hired someone with more than three brain cells. NORMANN: Mrs. C... [HYSTERICAL LAUGHTER] [ALL LAUGHING] Have a nice day, Sue Ellen. [INDISTINCT TALKING] No commitments. It's over when the song ends. Why don't we see what happens when the song ends. I think I like the sound of that. [CHUCKLES] Maybe Liam and Cathy could move into the house. There's plenty of room. It is pretty big just for you. Well, I wasn't thinking of it just for me, you know. I do know. Oh, wouldn't it be great having Cath here? We could raise thousands of dollars for the school, touring in "The two Juliet's." Ross could do the music. Michael can get us the bookings, sets, stage manager, and mommo and pop-o... ♪
