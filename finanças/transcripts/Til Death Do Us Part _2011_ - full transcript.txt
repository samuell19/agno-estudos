Once there was a village called Goddess Temple high up in the mountains. Once there was a fever that the world called AIDS. It snuck into our village softly, and everyone who got it died like falling leaves. Look, that's me right there. My name was Xin, and I was 12. Look, there's my dad. Who did it? And my uncle. Who?! It was weird, seeing myself like that. And seeing grandpa. They said it was dad's fault people got sick, and that Uncle had it coming. If I'm going to tell our story, I guess it starts from here. Start? Start? Do you want me to start? There's a new cure... to celebrate! So forgive the singer if his song is poor- he wishes you joy and health, longevity! I hitched a ride upon a cloud Saw things no mortal sees I leaped from cloud to cloud At immortal speed The clouds, they parted The world appeared before my eyes To the east, the boundless sea To the south, the sacred peaks To the west, the temples fair To the north, the fragrant springs And the heavens above... What? How is the new medication? There is a new medication for the fever. - Go ahead, ask Old Zhu. - Ask him! - Ask him! - Yes, there is! Ask me what? Old Zhu said, There's a cure for the fever, right? I'm not lying! You told me yourself. Sure. - There is! - No there isn't! Qiquan told me. He's standing right there. Dad, why bother lying? They'll find out, eventually. Kneel down and apologize. It's the least you can do. If there's no cure, let them hear it from you! Get down on your knees! Get down on your knees! Bow your head. Bow your head. Do it! Grandpa... My son, the blood merchant... Got blood? Qiquan's your man. Anytime, anyplace, at a price that's fair! Stop! Grandpa. Let's go home, grandpa. Don't you start, too! We're going home! Please forgive me... for having a son like that. I raised him, but I couldn't teach him. Please remember... my younger son has the fever, too. And my grandson was only 12... Even if it was Qiquan's fault you got infected, I beg you not to hold it against our family. Since all the teachers ran off, and the kids go to school in town, the school is empty. If you're afraid of infecting your families, come live in the school, and I'll look after you. I admit it, I lied about the medicine. They say the fever's a new plague, and nothing in the world can cure it. Gee!! Another victim! Run run run!!! And that was the last concert the old musician ever gave. That's our village school where grandpa was a caretaker. When the weather got cold, the sick villagers started moving in. After I die, I want you to take our son and get remarried. Leave this god-awful place. Don't worry, I'll be fine. Go on home. But don't forget to visit every day! Here in the school, all meals will be communal. Who volunteers to cook? If you men are too macho for the kitchen, I'll do it. But no disrespect. We'd respect you more in the bedroom! Now, now, in this school, everyone gets treated with respect. Same goes for school property, desks and such. Treat then with the same respect you'd show your own wife. Or better yet, someone else's wife! We'll pool our food stores, and whatever government rations we get. Ratso, you'll keep accounts. Ol' Confucius keeps my books Ol' Man Heaven looks after my fields I'm god's own goddamn daddy from now until the day I die! Stop that! No one's dying. God is our father. Old Zhu's the godfather here, so he should be our headmaster. Headmaster Zhu! Dad? Instead of sleeping in the dorm, what say I bunk with you? You've had your fill. Don't be so greedy. Dad, can you drop by and check on Haoyan? She trusts you, so I thought you could talk her out of remarrying when I die. Then I can rest in peace. Don't think dark thoughts. What's so funny? Hell, look at the artist! You counting the days? Every day counts, if you make every day count. It's worth remembering. Assembly! Assembly in the schoolyard! See? It's not here. I loved your red silk jacket. How'd you lose it? Qinqin How'd you lose it? I hung it on my bedpost. No, I'm warm enough in this. Dad? Dad? Let's search! Search the school! Whoever took it, leave it in the schoolyard tonight. No questions asked! Dad? You asleep? Haoyan went back to her mom's. She hasn't visited in ages. I've been counting the days. What are you doing? I want to find out who the thief was. Who's that? Qinqin! Why are you out here in the middle of the night? I wanted to see who stole my jacket. My thoughts exactly. You scared? So why'd you sell your blood? To buy this expensive shampoo I saw on TV. A girl from our village bought it, and her hair was smooth as silk. I wanted to try it, too. You? Everyone was selling blood. My brother wouldn't let me, so I sold mine in another village. I heard he was a cheat. Took more blood than he paid for. They stole your jacket. Why not steal from them? No, all a person has is face. To hell with face. Did you husband give you any? When he heard you were sick, he beat you. Everyone knows. That's how little he cared, just enough to hit you. If it were me, I'd have infected him and never said a word. Did you infect your wife? Truth is, she hasn't touched me in over a year, not since I was diagnosed. Think about it... I'm not even 30. Yeah, same here. My husband said I was too filthy to be buried next to him. What a shit! If it were me, I'd be proud to be buried by your side. You must be cold. Qinqin... I want to say something. Damn it... you and I belong together! Now's not the time. What better time is there? Halt... About, face! Brush! Spit! I just want to catch the thief. About, right! No... Double time! Don't be scared. I'll help you fix him. Is there no justice in this world? Is there no justice in this world? There's no justice. Slow down and tell me what happened. They stole my notebook and some money. I put it under my pillow, and this morning they were gone. I don't care about the money, but that notebook... I can't lose it! There's private stuff in there! Assembly! I'll search! Whoever steals, steals from me. I'll know who stole from my cousin's wife, too. Search! Search party! Nobody move! Miss a woman's smell? Shut it! Whose bed is this? Confess and be punished! Resist and we'll be merciful! Wait, other way around! No! Cook, have you been stealing rice? No. You searched my bed? How could you? I'm up before dawn, cooking and cleaning. Well, I'm sick, too! Why should I wait on you? If I were out working, at least I'd get paid! Have I ever asked for a penny? So I took a few grains of rice! How could you be so cruel? You're heartless! If your family needed rice that badly, you should have asked me. I don't need your charity! Dad! Look! You took the jacket? What about my diary? Have you seen it? It has sentimental value. It's red. A red notebook. You'd think it was made of gold. It's not worth anything, I swear! How can I lose my notebook? Qinqin, about your jacket... Qinqin? Where's my notebook? Red notebook. Where can it be? Where can it be? Where? I couldn't find it... I couldn't... Red notebook... couldn't find it... Time to eat! Still missing your notebook? Silun! Aren't you hungry? Hey, you found it. How's Silun? He's not feeling well. Not hungry. Silun was always impatient, even more so after he lost his diary. Everyone knows we all die sooner or later. What was his hurry? No one would sleep in the school again. And the next world was even emptier than this one. Dad! After New Year, I'm taking Little Jun to visit my mom. What's the point of having a wife if you're never even here? Stand back, everyone! Be careful! Stand back! Get your tofu here! Fresh tofu! Get your tofu! You dropped your cigarette. Hey, you dropped your cigarette. You dropped your cigarette! We're better off in the school. Go tell your dad. He'll listen to you. She's right. Only if Qinqin goes with me. Go ahead, Qinqin. It's for the greater good. We're alone. Did you miss me? Didn't you miss me? I mostly thought about being sick. There's nothing to live for. Nothing to live for? I'll give you something to live for! I won't live out the year. If you marry me, I'd take you. And take you... and take you... and take you... Come on, Qinqin! - Deyi! - Qinqin! Get down! Qinqin! Stop it! Deyi! It's dangerous! Qinqin! Zhao Deyi! You stupid bastard! I'm god's own goddamn daddy... from now until the day I die... from now until the day I die...! Open up! Students reporting for class! When everyone moved back into the school, their food attracted the usual scavengers. Table scraps not good enough for you? This is people food. It's not for you. Scram! Hey, what's my dad doing here? This is high-quality city flour. Consider it as a gift from me. [For coffins, call 4888-888] Hey... When the time comes, I'll give you a discount. Dad, you think he bought that flour, or got it free from the government? Go to sleep. I'm just going to the toilet. Today Cook said she thought she saw my husband. You think he came for me? Sure, let him come. Let him see your buttons missing. Come. Come on. Open the door. You got the key? Hey! The lock's brand new. Someone planned this. Dad? Dad! Dad! Open the door! Open the door first! Dad! Who's got the key? I'll kowtow right here, if you just give me the key! Come on, Deyi doesn't deserve this. Dad, smash the lock! Smash the lock! Dad! Come on, just smash the lock! I'll do it. Look, isn't that Qinqin's husband? Xiaohai... Cheat on me, will you? What the hell are you looking at? Get out there! Get out there! You whore! Cheat on me! Get out there! You whore! Show them what a slut looks like! See? Sloppy slippers! See? Xiaohai, she's sick. Let her go! You mind your own business! Well, you had your fun. Did I amuse you? Glad I could help entertain you. Don't you know that? You'll come to no good end! I'm a dead man anyway. Is this fair to Haoyan? She had a man before me. Is that fair to me? Then think of your son. Your son! Oh... we thought you were inside. Come here, we need to talk. We locked them in, and gave the key to Qinqin's husband. He wanted to give one to Deyi's wife, too. But I stopped him. It's out of my respect for you, as you were once my teacher. We'd sure hate... for her to find out. That's why we have a proposition. Well, that's all I have to say. This school needs some new blood, they are passionate and capable, so I'm putting these two young men in charge. NOTICE Rule One: If you don't contribute your fair share of food, may your whole family get the fever and die! Two: All government rations of food and medicine will be shared. Cheaters and disobedients will see all their ancestors and descendants die. Three... Deyi, I hear you scored the other day. I just take it day by day. Three: Three: Extra-marital affairs are immoral deeds. Any offender who get caught will wear the sign of their shame and be paraded through the village streets! Stop right there! No one takes school property! What happens when the kids come back? What then? Old Zhu Quesi and I have promised to share the things with every household. Besides, I thought we had an understanding... Dad, It's not our stuff. Butt out! This is all vour fault! Have it your way. You'll take these things over my dead body! No one can take away anything from here! Come here! [Zhao Lianzhu is fired!!] Starting today, you're fired from this school! You're not fit to lead. Qiquan milked this village dry, and infected us with dirty blood! Now he's profiting by selling coffins! Earning money from dead people! And your younger son's no better, fooling around on his wife. With his cousin's wife, no less! I'm doing you a favor letting you stayhere! Let's go! Still won't budge, huh? [Blackboard reads: “I'll get your goats and your groats.”] Here, dad. Go home. Work things out with your wife. My aunt had moved back to her hometown. It was obvious to her and everyone in the village. Uncle and Qinqin were in love. Qinqin's husband finally kicked her out for good. Everyone moved out of the school, and grandpa was alone again. Dad, Qiquan's back. He wants to see you. We're moving into town soon. Then to the city, as soon as I can afford to. You can come with us if you want, or stay here with Deyi. When he's gone, you can come live with us, and I'll support you in your old age. After all, we're family. Look! Look at what I drew! Is that...? Shush! Wow, real leather! Holy shit... Can you imagine going to the afterlife in this? It's worth dying for! Give us two coffins like this, and all the trees in the village are yours! Old Zhu? Old Zhu! I've been thinking it over, and I wanted to return this. Someone else might need it. The truth is, when my wife and I got married, I promised her a red silk jacket. Now even my daughter is getting married, I just... want her to have one. I didn't mean to steal. Grandpa made the long, long trip to borrow Qinqin's red silk jacket. Geda saw his daughter wearing it just once before he died. Don't take anything that isn't yours. Xiaohai has a new fiancée. When the time comes, give him a divorce, if you're still alive. Understand? What do you want? No one can see us. Not that I'd care if they did. You came back for your summer clothes? How are you feeling? Don't go. Haoyan's divorcing me. Xiaohai's divorcing you. We're free. Now we can be together. No matter what happens while we live, we can be buried together, so we won't be alone. Why are you crying? Let's live together. Who cares what they say? Who cares what anyone says? Let them try to stop us. Don't go. Live with me. And if my house is too full of memories, we'll find someplace else. Qinqin, come out you shameless whore! Shang Qinqin! Come out here right now! Get out! Shang Qinqin! Get out! Aunt. She's my wife now. If there's a problem, talk to me. Your wife? As long as she's married to Xiaohai, she's still my daughter-in-law! You've got some nerve! That's right. I seduced her, and now she's shacking up with me. So if you want to take it out on someone, take it out on me. You shameless... Said enough? Go ahead, hit me. Leave it. You greedy pig! Come back here! Come back, you swine! Come back! Come back! Steal my rice, will you? Steal my rice? Come back... Think you can out run me? Hey, put me down! Look at her! Help! Hey bro... If you need a hand, just ask! I'm not that worthless yet! Hey, bro... Bro... Sick as you are, can you still do it with Qinqin? Sure, twice a night. Hey, wait up... Wow. Sexy. Wish I had the fever. Want mine? Let me share with you. Qinqin? I keep dreaming about my mom. She says she feels cold in her sleep and asks me to warm her feet. When did she die? About ten years ago. From now on, I'll be your mom. When you call her name, think of me. Call me mom, and I'll love you like your mother. And I'll love you any way you want. Mom? I want your breast... You're awful! Next you'll want me to call you daddy. Here, come to daddy... Blabber? Cook's gone. After that pig ate her rice, she got really mad. Now she's gone. We're going to bury her with this bag of rice, so she doesn't leave empty-handed. It's out of batteries. Kind of like me. No one expected, Cook to die so soon. Then Blabber died, and no one ever hear the sound of his megaphone again. Let's get married. When we can still make it official. What do you say? Daddy... Dad! Dad? I want to marry Qinqin. I need your help. You go to see Xiaohai and ask him to divorce Qinqin. No, I won't do it. Too ashamed. My husband doesn't want me, and my family doesn't want me. My brother hid from me. Even my own mother too. I know it's shameless, but I'm still alive and life goes on. I want to be Deyi's wife. Even if it's only for 6 months, or a few weeks, if we're married, we can be buried together, like family. Why's mommy crying? Xiaohai's out working! To be honest, I've met someone. She wants to get married this month. But how can I, when those two are shacking up and planning a wedding, too? Wanting to go official? We'll see who gives in first! Uncle! Uncle, wait! I'll divorce Qinqin on one condition. My fiancée wants a bigger house. Give me Deyi's house, after he's gone. That way, it remains in the family. When I got a confirmation in black and white, I'll agree to divorce with Qinqin. I'll sign the paper immediately. [“Last Will and Testament”] Can your brother really get our marriage licenses, if we're not there in person? Of course. No sweat. Hey, it's almost winter. You shouldn't wash with cold water. Is that him? I bet it is? Here, drink this. Daddy, promise me something? Don't bury me in black. Buy me a dress. A red dress. I've always love red. Come on, drink. And something plain, so I have two outfits. All right. And a pair of high heels. A red one. You can walk around in heaven in your high heels, just like a city girl. It'll be great! You lie. You want me to die first. I didn't mean that. Yes you did, so you can go back to your wife. Want to know the truth? I've been sick longer than you! You want to see me die first? Yes. Okay! How? I'll hang myself! All right. There's a rope in the closet. If we die together, I'll know this wasn't all a waste. Everyday counts, I want to live. But if you die, who'll nurse me? Mommy... Bro! Come on in. You know what these cost me? A perfectly good coffin. You gave up everything for that slut, even willed away the house. You'd be better off dead! What are you doing alive? If not for dad, I wouldn't have helped. What are you buying? Qinqin... Qinqin... Qinqin... Mom... I'm all better. My fever's gone. I bought wedding candy. Come on. Get up. Deyi... I know ours is a second marriage, but I still want everyone to know. Get up. Mommy! Deyi and I are married. See? Here, have some wedding candy. Take some. Have some candy. It's wedding candy. Don't be shy. Congrats. See? Just like yours. It's so red it looks fake, doesn't it? Ratso? We're married. And we owe it all to you, for locking us in the storeroom together. If we are having a baby later we will come to thank you again. See? Look. It's official. Ratso? Come on! Have some candy! Qinqin, open your mouth. Yummy, huh? Uncle and Qinqin were married, but they still didn't know that their happiness wouldn't last for long. On that same day, I got married too. To a dead stranger, twice my age, and they moved my bones far, far away. I've got mansions by the millions and too many wives to count descendants in the billions goddesses to cook for me fairy maids to wait on me I'm god's own goddamn daddy... from now until the day I die! Today... was Xin's wedding. I didn't tell you I don't want you to get upset. Here. You'd sacrifice your son for your own ambition? Her dad's the governor! His word is law! They like Xiaoxin. Now that we're family, we're going into real estate. Look at this land. We're going to turn this whole place into a high-class cemetery, a heaven on earth! City folks will go nuts for it. I know. The villagers hate me Do you think I care? I never set out to be evil, but I'll be damned if I'm poor! Few are born into luxury, but you know what? I'll let everyone bury in luxury! The pain's killing me! Killing me! My leg! It hurts! Oh, god... Talk to me! If someone has to go first, let it be me. Our coffins aren't ready yet. If Qiquan don't give me, I won't be able to do anything with him. Huh? Can I ask you something? Don't get mad. Tell me. Haoyan has someone else, doesn't she? Tell me... Talk to me... Talk to me... They'll never be as happy as we are. Don't you know that? I married you to be your wife and I always love you like your mother. When your wet your pants, I washed them for you. Whatever you wanted, I gave you. I've really become your mommy. Didn't I put my breast in your mouth to pacify you like a baby and nurse you to sleep? I have been having a fever for half a month. The minute we got our marriage license, my fever went away. You know why? Because I love you. I love being married to you. Didn't I love you enough? Why do you want to leave me? Don't you want your Qinqin? Don't you want me? Don't you want me? I haven't even had the chance to call your dad father-in-law. Tomorrow I'll bring him back here and he can live with us. I'll cook for him, and do the wash, and knit for him and for you. Alright? Don't let me die, okay? Wake me up... I'm burning up... Mommy... Mommy... Ice, I need ice. Ice... Can't you hurry up? Bring me ice... I need ice. I'm burning up. Mommy... Mommy... I'm on fire... Mommy... Mommy... I'm on fire... Mommy... I'm thirsty. Mom? I'm thirsty... Mom? Mom? I'm thirsty... Why don't you answer? If you won't answer, I'll just keep calling. Mom... Mom... Mom... Mommy... Certificate of marriage! Zhao Deyi and Shang Qinqin Have some candy.
