Oh, good morning, Joe. Your coach is an idiot. You should fire him. -Give my best to Ethel. -Will do. -Oh, good morning, Roz. -Morning, Jake. -Do you know what time it is? -I will in a second. Well, I wouldn't have to remind you if you weren't out gallivanting all night... ...with some chipee half your age. For your information, Miss Tzu and I attended a morning yoga class. Oh, that should make it easier for her to wrap you around her little finger. Might I remind you, Roz, Miss Tzu is not a gold digger. She is the youngest partner in the history of her hedge fund. And I might I remind you, it's cheaper to rent than to own. Alright, what else we got? You missed the scouting meeting, commissioner wants you to call him, TV contract talks resume after lunch, and your kids are waiting for you. Well, that's great. Why didn't you tell me? I wanted to see what kind of mood you were in first. Well, what a surprise. You know, I can't remember the last time you both were here. Ten years ago. You remember that, dad. November 9th, 2007, when Vladimir Nestikov kicked me in the head... ...going after the "loose ball." I always admired that guy's hustle. Dad, we need to talk. Why don't you sit down? Oh, okay. Is everything...? So, what is it? Is... Is everything okay? Is your mom alright? -She's fine, dad. -Good, good. I want you to listen carefully, and I want you to know that what we're about to say is not easy. Alex, are you pregnant? Absolutely not. -Is your grandmother okay? -She's fine, dad. Well, if no one died, then why are you here? We're here because times have changed. And family ownership of a franchise is no longer viable. It's time to sell the team, dad. That's not the way we agreed to approach this, Barton. It doesn't matter how we sugar coat it. That's why we're here, right? Dad, I know this must be painful for you, but I think after you reflect on this, you will agree with us. Dad, just check this out. We commissioned two independent studies, and they both came to the same conclusion. Selling the team before the beginning of the season... ...would spare us the burden of huge eventual estate taxes. It would allow the new owners to negotiate expiring contracts... ...and take advantage of low interest rates... ...to improve or replace the stadium. -Would you mind if I took a look at those? -Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. Just... Great. Thank you. Wow, look at that. That's... That's really... Okay, well, you know what? Thank you both for dropping by. Why don't you get Roz to set up a dinner for us real soon? Dad, this is not going away. Okay. I am doing my best not to lose my temper when I discover that my life's work, your grandfather and your great-grandfather's life's work, means about as much to you two as a disposable razor! I'm sorry to be the one to say this, but selling is in the best interest of our family trust. Oh, and by "best interest of the family trust," you mean yourselves. Dad, this isn't personal. This is business. If you read the reports you'd see. I'd see what, huh? A bunch of graphs, numbers, recommendations to build luxury boxes, raise ticket prices? Replacing your name on this arena with some mattress company's? I know, why don't we move the team to Quebec? Is that the kind of crapola that they teach you... ...in this so-called business school? No, they teach me that a business has to make money. This one, unlike half the league, does. Please! At the end of last season, your net profit was a little over three million dollars. FYI, in Silicon Valley, that's a janitor's Christmas bonus. You know, what you two fail to understand is, with me, it is not all about the Benjamins. I have poured my heart and soul into this franchise. Daddy, don't over-romanticize a bunch of pituitary cases... ...getting paid millions of dollars... ...to scratch their groins and choreograph high-five routines. You cannot look at your competitors... ...and say that you've kept up with the times. What? I'm gonna let some number-crunchers tell me how to run my team? No. We are gonna do this the way we got here. Exactly the way my grandfather did it. That's exactly my point. There are a lot of factories sitting empty today... ...because people tried to run their businesses... ...just like their grandfathers. You know, I always imagined... ...that my children would want to go into the family business and succeed me. But instead, you put a knife in my back! Dad, there are so many more meaningful things... ...that could be done with all that money. To help people and change millions of lives. And exactly how would you do this, Alexandria? By giving it away to those who are less fortunate than us. -You are just like your mother. -Thank you. I'm gonna start a start-up that funds start-ups. And exactly what would this "start-up" do? We're gonna promote disruptive business practices. Well, the only business you're disrupting is mine. So, while you're heading out, I would expect that you have a different plan, because the only way that I'm going to leave this team... My team. ...is inside an urn. I'm sorry, dad. We appreciate how you feel, but the fact is, we're all shareholders, and we can out-vote you. Oh, so I guess all those math tutors I paid for didn't earn their keep? Because if I recall, I still control 51 percent of the voting stock. Yes, but only if you control mom's six percent. Oh, your mother's? Yeah, you know, your mom and I might not see eye-to-eye these days, or ever, for that matter, but she swore to me that I would control her proxy. And we had a binding agreement. We've never actually put it on paper, but we did definitely pinky swear on it. And Frankie would never, ever, ever break a sacred pinky swear. Would she? Cornell residence. Irma, put Frankie on the phone, please! Okay, okay! Miss Francis! Miss Francis! -It's Mister Jake. -Here we go. Jake, dear. I did so want to be there in person to explain everything, but the foundation is having its big fundraiser. It's gonna be so much fun. We are having a huge pajama party. No, I don't care about some stupid pajama party! How dare you try and ruin my life? Look, I know it's a shock, but you have no right to speak to me like that. We're not married anymore. You and those two turncoats... Well, you always said you wanted our children to have minds of their own, and now that they do, you don't like it? We had an agreement, Frankie! We pinky swore it! I'm sorry if our children's futures mean more to me... than the sanctity of a pinky swear. Okay, fine. Fine. -You want to play rough? We'll play rough. -Thank you, Jake. You've just erased any thoughts I might have had about selling. Scorched earth, Frankie. That's all that'll be left when I'm done with you. Let's be sure not to do this again. Scorched earth! He's doing better than I thought he would. He didn't jump out the window. Yet. Mister Jakes total rejection... ...to basketball analytics as a managerial tool... ...is totally out of step with the times. He's an anachronism. Well, it would be different... ...if either of our children wanted to succeed him. I do feel for Jake. That team is his life. Which is why you divorced him! A baby touches a hot stove once, he don't do it no more. I am not to keep bandaging your hand again. Oh, please. I have absolutely no interest in Jake Cornell. I just feel sorry for him. The same way I would a wounded animal. You should know, wounded animals are the most dangerous kind. So keep your distance. Jake, this trust is iron clad. No flaws, no back doors. I ought to know, I wrote it. Well, then maybe I should hire someone smarter than you. Well, evidently, you think you are. Okay, then what do you think that I should do? Start working on your golf game. Oh, you poor dear, I came as soon as I heard. Miss Tzu is here. Thank you, Roz. How did you know that this was happening? Oh, please. Your son has been Tweeting like a songbird. I mean, the whole entire world knows. I don't believe it. Some of my fondest memories are coming here as a kid... ...and sitting on my grandfather's lap and feeling the place shake... ...as the crowd jumped on their feet to cheer. Jake, you can buy another team. You could start a whole new league. Like taking your cousin to the prom. It'd feel a little weird. Well, if only you were a publicly held company. I mean, you could adopt a shareholder's rights plan. What? What do you mean, a "shareholder's rights?" Well, you know, like a poison pill strategy. Whereby a company, pursued by a hostile bidder, denigrates all its assets... ...in order to make the acquisition extremely unattractive. So you mean like dismantle my front office... ...and trade my star players for journeymen... ...who don't have the hops to jump to a conclusion? Strip everything to a bare bone... ...and make this a team that no one would want to own? Exactly. Miss Tzu... ...you... ...are a genius. Well... I couldn't do it. But maybe my family might think I would. Because sometimes, desperate men do desperate things. Okay, okay, hold your water! Hold your water! Mister Jake? So good to see you. Goodbye! -Irma! -Goodbye! -Irma! -Goodbye! Irma, stop it. -Where is she? -She's not here. You shouldn't be here. This is not a good time, Mister Jake! Fiddlesticks! I want to talk to my wife. Ex-wife. It's... It's good to see you, Frankie. I wish I could say the same. I told him he shouldn't be here. Really? -You're gonna do this now? -Yes, but this is... I don't care, I just want... Frankie, listen. I just need five minutes. -My name's Francis. -Well, I prefer Frankie. Always so sensitive to my feelings. In any case, next time, call first. Or e-mail me. Then we won't have to speak. Okay, you need to hear what I have to say. He doesn't listen. Otherwise, he'd know that speed wins rings, not size. Would you please stop telling me how to run my team? That's the problem here, Jake. It's not just your team. That's right, you tell him! -Okay, would you stay out of this, please? -Don't talk to my Irma like that. Well, then maybe you should put a leash on the hired help. -Well, how do you...? -That is not a fair thing to... What in blazes is going on here? Would you tell your butler to mind his P's and Q's? Bunky is not my butler. He's her lover. -Don't you read the gossip column? -No. Vernice Bidwell the Third. And judging by your charming demeanor, I take it you're Mr Cornell. Well, it's not every day you get to shake hands... ...with the man who burst the housing bubble. You give me too much credit. Oh, and here I thought that's exactly what your banks did. Look, I'd love to exchange witty repartee with you, but if you don't mind, I'd like to speak privately to my wife. Ex-wife. Actually, I do mind. And as such, I'd appreciate you leaving immediately. Okay, don't bust your cummerbund there, Bunky, but I need two minutes with the mother of my children. Are you refusing to leave, sir? Would you ask your boy-toy to please cool his heels... ...for a New York minute? Arthur! You better leave now, Mister Jake. -Come in here, please. -You don't want to meet him. -No, you don't want to see Arthur.- Who's Arthur? I don't care what... Arthur, ooh. A bodyguard, huh? Yeah, I'd like to see how tough you are without him around. Oh, I'm not much of a fighter. Although I wouldn't want to tangle with my lawyers. They're killers. Arthur, would you see Mr Cornell to the door? Hey, woah, woah. Just a minute there, Arthur. Because my lawyers can be ruthless as well. Help! What in...? Hey! You haven't seen the last of me, Bunky. Okay, you know what? You... You can throw me out, Frankie, but I'll be here when you get home! Arthur, put him down. Thank you. Obviously, Jake, you won't leave me alone until you've had your say. You have two minutes. That's all I need. So, how long have you been going out with the Earl of White Bread? There's nothing wrong with white bread. No, I just wouldn't want to eat it every day. You have a minute-and-a-half left. Well, then let's get right to it. Now I understand that you want what's best for our children's future, so if I were in your shoes, I wouldn't tick me off. Because if you do, I'll adopt what they call the "poison pill strategy..." ...and strip the team so bare, you couldn't sell it on eBay. So if you really want to protect their financial health, you will withdraw your support for a sale immediately. You would ruin the most important thing in the world to you... ...just to spite your own family? That's up to you. That's quite a threat. The way I see it, you aren't acting in the best interest of the trust. I'm afraid the children and I are gonna have to remove you... ...from the day-to-day operations of the team... ...while we pursue a sale. You're bluffing. That's up to you. Arthur? Come in here, please. No, Arthur, don't. Are you serious, Frankie? You're gonna push me out the door? Who's gonna run the team? I thought I could. You? Replace me? You know, I had no interest in getting in the middle of this, but once again, you have inspired me. I'm taking personal active control of the Cougars, and I'm gonna do it my way. Arthur, Mr Cornell is ready to leave now. Wait. Wait, wait, wait. Time out! Frankie, you can't... You can't do this to me! I take it back, I pinky promised! Frankie, I... Come on! Morning, Joe. Your coach is an idiot. You should fire him. -Is that so? -Oh, you'll see. -Give my best to Ethel. -Bye-bye. Roz, you're a doll. -Are the decorators here? -Yes. It's gonna be a pleasure to get rid of all those old musty things. Like Jake? Tell Emilio I love his color palate. Unfortunately, we have to stick with the team's colors. Right. Miss Cornell? A minute of your time, please? Coach Zimmer is here to see you. Mister Zimmer, how nice of you to stop by. -Would you like a smoothie? -No, I'm not gonna stay long. Look, I wanna get a few things straightened out here. Now, your husband and I didn't always see eye-to-eye, but he was a basketball man. And now that he's gone, I want you to understand that this is my team... ...and I'm calling the shots here. Are we clear? I guess Joe was right. -Who's Joe? -The man who said I should fire you. And that's exactly what I'm going to do. What? I'm relieving you of your duties, immediately. You are making a big mistake, lady. You have a half-an-hour to clear out your office. Ah, you bet. Thanks for stopping by. -Your husband... -Ex-husband. Whatever. He's been dogging on a contract extension... ...for big shot here for eight months. That is no way to treat the greatest player in franchise history. I completely agree. And I'm ready to settle this right here and now. How much do you want? Three years, 88 million. That's a lot of money. Well, the way I see it, we're losing that much not being in a major market. Well, if you think you can do better somewhere else, I'm not gonna stop you. But, Bobby, you don't want to leave Seattle, do you? You spent your entire career with the Cougars. Your family's happy here, the entire city loves you. But I can't afford to pay all that money to one player. It wouldn't be fair to the other boys. But I am prepared to offer you a fraction of that, and I think you'll say yes. Good morning, everyone. Oh, please. I haven't had so many boys fighting over me... ...since I was in high school and played Maria in West Side Story. One at a time now, and please be gentle. It's my first time. Ms, Cornell, with all due respect, what do you know about basketball? Well, I know the last two minutes of the game... ...take forever and ever. The line to the ladies room is even longer, and the only performance-enhancing drugs I approve of... ...won't add a point to your scoring average. Is the team for sale? What are you offering? So, what are you doing to put your stamp on the team? Actually, I'm planning a few changes. Oh, she wouldn't dare. For starters, we've hired chef Wolfgang Schvantz... ...to create a new and exciting menu for our concession stands, including vegetarian and gluten-free items. And instead of those drab rags, our team will be wearing new uniforms... ...designed by none other than the House of Emilio. What about firing your coach? Funny you should mention that, because modeling the Cougars' totally re-imagined look, making his runway debut is our newly-signed player/coach, the legendary Bobby "Big-Shot" Sanders! That's right, Big-Shot will be our leader... ...on the bench and on the court for the next 10 years. Thanks to him signing the largest contract in the history of our sport. Call me an ambulance. They love her. You don't have to sound so gleeful about it. Oh, right. You gotta admit, Jake, those new uniforms are pretty snazzy. Ben, let's not forget that you still work for me. Yeah... I was gonna talk to you about that. Oh, jumping ship, huh? Yeah, the first to go are always the rats. She's my cousin. I promised my mother I'd look after her. Fine. Fine. I... I will get myself a new attorney. As a matter of fact, I'll get a dozen. I will spend every cent I have to get the Cougars back. And the other owners? They will come to their senses... ...when they see how easy it is for their ungrateful kids and ex-wives... ...to kick them to the curb. Jake, Jake, look. Now, listen to yourself, okay? Is this really what you wanna do? You wanna start a war and rip your family apart? No, this situation, Ben... ...calls for exceptional measures. What are you gonna do? Call in a drone strike? No. To keep them from selling my team... ...I just need to get Frankie to let me keep controlling her stock. How are you gonna do that? Well, the easiest way is to get Frankie to fall back in love with me. What? What? Hey, Ben. Ben, come on. Come on, you can help me here. Oh, no, I can't. No, no. I've seen enough war movies... ...to know what happens to the guy who collaborates with the enemy. Oh, come on. If you didn't think we belonged together, you would never have introduced us. Well, I did a lot of foolish things in my youth. Fine, Ben. You just watch me. Because I will do whatever it takes to get my team back. You know, even if that means marrying her a second time. You mean a third time, don't you? Right. Forgot about that one. Oh, hi. Thank you so much for coming. I was afraid you weren't gonna show. Please, have a seat. Yeah, there you go. I shouldn't be here. If Miss Francis finds out about this, she'll boil me like a lobster. Well, if she does, you make sure you save me the tail. You're a very naughty boy, Mister Jake. Hey, your secret is safe with me, Irma. Scout's honor. Waiter? Could I get a single malt scotch, neat, in a brandy snifter? You have a good memory, Mister Jake. Oh, I do. That, I do. Because, as you know, Irma, I've had a lot of time on my hands lately. I had a lot of time to reflect, and what I've come to realize is that I've never been happier... ...than when I was with Frankie. So you're gonna prey on her weakness for you... ...to stop her from selling the team? So, you admit she has a weakness for me? Oh, no, no. I've said enough already. Okay, look. You know we belong together. Frankie and I are like lemonade and iced tea. We're completely different, but you put us together? -You've got an Arnold Palmer. -No, no, no. Miss Francis doesn't like lemonade. It leaves a sour aftertaste. You know how we were. Frankie and I had crazy wonderful times together. Nobody loved anyone more. You should know, you changed the sheets. Those were wonderful times. -We were so happy. -I know. Yes. Yeah, see? And we could all be happy together again. You know her so well. Please, Irma, help me. I'm sorry, Mister Jake. I can't. Look, I know what you're thinking. I'm not going to hurt her again. No, it's not that. Miss Francis is appointing me... ...the Cougars' new vice president of statistical analysis. Congratulations. Okay, look, since you're so good with numbers, what are my chances? Six percent, at best. Look, I know that you can't help me, but if you could, where would you recommend I start? I mean, hypothetically? -Hypothetically? -Yeah. To attract bull's attention, the matador waves his red cape. Make her jealous! Oh, that's good. Yeah, that is good. But what about Bunky? -Ah, he's nice arm candy. -Yeah, I know. I know. He's the one percent -of the one percent. -No, no, no. You don't have to worry. He's not enough man for her. I know. She tells me everything. I still change the sheets. Yes. Oh, fiddlesticks. Of all the nerve. Remember, my dear, you're here to relax. Well, what a pleasant surprise. You know, when the starter asked us to fill out a foursome, I had no idea who we'd be bunking with. Oh, I'm sorry. Where are my manners? This is my constant companion, Miss Pai Gai Tzu. Vernice Bidwell, what an unexpected pleasure. And Miss Cornell. You look so much younger in person without all that heavy make-up on. -So, who would like to tee off first? -I will. You are rude and know no boundaries, and if you think I'm gonna stand here and listen to you moan... ...and cry about your beloved team... Oh, I have no interest in basketball anymore. Yeah, that chapter of my life is closed. Finito. And I'm fine with it. Yeah. I'm actually more interested in being out here in the fresh air... ...and working on my game. I don't believe you. Bunky, you're the club president. Do something. And as such, I'm obliged to enforce the rules... ...regarding assigned pairings. I guess today, we won't need a wager to make things interesting. Excellent. Well, who would like the honors? I'll go. Excuse me, dear. The women's tees are further up. No need. Holy Hannah. Well, Miss Tzu was NCAA Women's champion... ...while attending Stanford. She's got quite an interlocking grip. We get the picture. Oh dear, that... That was unfortunate. I'm headed that way. I'll give you a lift. Well, you're more than welcome to ride with me. I'd rather swallow hot coals. That's not... You know, like it or not, Frankie, our lives are somewhat intertwined with... ...with birthdays and graduations, weddings... And someday, we might even have a grandchild. I don't know how your little girlfriend's gonna feel... ...about having two in diapers. I was wondering how long it would take you to mention Miss Tzu. Quite a skill set on her, huh? For your sake, I hope one of them is CPR. My, you have already acquired quite the impressive resume, young lady. Thank you, sir. Please, call me Bunky. Very well, Bunky. -Can I ask you a personal question? -Certainly. But I will have to ask you to sign a confidentiality agreement. Have you ever considered buying a basketball team? No. I'm hardly the sportsman. But If I wanted to spend hundreds of millions of dollars... ...on fragile athletes with short shelf lives, I'd invest in race horses. Oh, I despise the game myself, but I do think it's an undervalued commodity. How so? Well, for instance, you own several television stations in secondary markets, right? Twenty-eight in all. I've been trying to unload them forever. Well, maybe you wouldn't need to if you owned a team. If your stations aired the team's game live... ...with a re-run on another day part, well, that's over 50,000 hours of original programming annually... that you'd be paying yourself to air. Blue dollars is my second favourite colored-dollar. Tell me more. And then if you acquired a baseball team, you would have year-round programming. You can turn your low band and UHF stations... ...into a national sports network. I could distribute it via cable and collect carrier fees... ...on top of ad revenues. You know, I know the perfect phone carrier... ...that would just love to tap into your digital spectrum. Young lady, you have a dirty mind. Why thank you, sir. So what's the...? That's the deal with you and Bunky? Does he make you happy the way I did? I am not gonna discuss my personal life with you. Well... ...I guess I'll take that as a no. You know, if you guys are having problems, it might make you feel better just to get it off your chest. Frankie, I just want you to know, if ever you need me around to talk, I'm here for you. You're welcome. What happened to him? I think the golf gods feel the same way that I do about him. Francis, I have an announcement to make. Due to an impending business opportunity, I'm afraid that both Miss Tzu and myself... ...need to detangle our personal relationships... ...with each of you. What does that mean? He's breaking up with you. Goodbye, Jake. I'd also like the key to my apartment back, please. What do you mean? She's breaking up with you. I know it's sudden, but I think it would be ill-advised to continue seeing one another... ...given that we intend to acquire controlling interest in the Cougars. -What? -What? I assure you, it's nothing personal. It's just business. You mind some company? Terry, get the man a margarita. Rocks, no salt, with a floater. -You remembered. -Don't make too much of it. Can you imagine Bunky thinks he's gonna own a basketball team? That man thinks that Air Jordan is how you fly to the Middle East. The only thing he needs to know how to do is sign a check. Frankie, the other owners will not approve him. Half of them lost their shirts in the last financial collapse. This is an inappropriate conversation for us to be having. Very well. So when was the last time you were dumped? First time for everything, I guess. How about you? Our last honeymoon. Let's hear those Cougars roar Roar Fight Fight Fight Together, we'll win today Together, we'll win today Excellent! Well, who needs it, anyway? People our age, dating, texting, sexting? It's all so silly. I think kids today have it right. Just hook up. Good times, no commitments... What do you think? You cannot be serious. You were wronged out there today, Frankie. And it's not unusual for people on the rebound... ...to go back to playing for their old team. We tried putting our old team back together before. The chemistry wasn't there anymore, remember? Maybe we just need to give it more time? Maybe we should have known better than to even try. Do you know, when he discovered the lightbulb, Edison tried 1200 filaments before he found one that would last? -Not your strongest selling point. -Come on. You know we're good together. Do you not remember what happened up at the cabin? Could there be a more convincing litmus test... ...than our second honeymoon? It wasn't that bad. It was the worst 36 hours of my life. Frankie, come on! Frankie! Listen to me. I'm just... Look, I'm just... I'm saying that maybe we're both at fault. -Pardon? -Yeah. Come on, it takes two to tango, right? So you're saying that I share the blame for what happened at the cabin? No, I am saying that maybe we can both learn from our mistakes. Believe me, I have. Frankie! Wait, let me get the door! And voila! I love you, Mrs Cornell. I love you, Mr Cornell. Frankie... Frankie, I promise you, this marriage is going to be so much better than the last one. That might be the kids. You should get that. Who cares? Forget the kids. The kids can wait. No, they probably got our message. Go ahead, answer it. Answer it. Hello? Yes, this is a bad time. What? New Orleans will trade their first draft pick? Crazy! Honey, I've gotta... Listen, listen. We need to do whatever we can to get the Sanders kid. This guy's a game changer. I want a full court press. Get their GM on the horn, find out how much blood they want in return, okay? Honey. Honey. This is amazing! Yeah. Yes, okay. Okay, after you sign the extensions with them, you trade them to Hartford. See, what that'll do is it'll create cap space... ...for you to sign Corbin. Hartford will then give me their draft choice, which I will trade, along with Price and Marks... ...to New Orleans to sign Sanders. Okay? No. Okay, how about this? You give me Corbin, I give you my second picks for the next three years. And my condo in Maui for Christmas. Okay, good. Yeah. Like it, like it. Good work, people. Frankie, the deal's done! Let's celebrate! Honey, no, no, no. We don't have to go home. -I finished the deal here. -Me too. The annulment papers are ready to be signed. What, what? What annulment papers? I thought it was more expedient than a divorce. -Goodbye. -No! What about our honeymoon? Our honeymoon ended the minute you went back on your word. Honey, honey, woah. Just... Listen... Don't... Give me that! You know you mean the world to me! Be honest with yourself! The team is number one and there is no number two! Okay, listen. You're a little upset, okay? So, let's not be hasty. Let's... Let's take a little time out. We'll... We'll go for a drink in the jacuzzi, okay? We'll chat. -Just give me a second chance. -This was your second chance! I'm telling you, this time will be different. Hey, I swear it. I pinky swear. You deserved it. You alright, mister? No. I lost my kids... ...I lost my wife... ...and I lost my team. But I'm gonna get them back. My name's Jake Cornell, and when I say I'm gonna do something, I do it. Thank you, Bryan. -How are you, Joe? -Never better, ma'am. Okay, one last one. You two, down on your knees. Down on your knees. Yeah, lean towards... Yes, yes, yes! This looks so good! Oh, you guys look so amazing. I think we got it, people. -Yeah, it looks so great. -Thank you. Thanks, you guys. Mother, this is such a surprise! -Hello, dear. -Hi. Come. Come in the cart. I understand you don't have time to visit your mother, too busy stealing Latvian teenagers from their mothers, and covering up DUI's. I'm sorry I haven't seen you lately, but don't worry. It's only temporary. Funny, you didn't look like a temp out there. Well, it's a national campaign. The publicity is good for the team. You're starting to sound like Jake. It's only temporary. I certainly hope so. You spend enough time as it is with big furry animals. And I certainly didn't raise you to be a tomboy. What is all this? I think she has a secret admirer. It's from Jake. How sweet. Have them sent to the hospital. Consider it done. There's some very expensive flowers here, dear. Are you sure you don't want to keep any of them? No. I want nothing to do with him. The man is pestering me every turn I make. Last night, I went to dinner at Martelli's, and as soon as I sit down, the waiter comes over with an expensive glass of champagne, says it's from the gentleman in the next booth, Jake. So I stand up, pour the champagne over his head and walk out. And then I give the valet 100 dollars so he could let the air out of his tires. Francis, do you hear yourself? You're giggling like a sixth-grader with a schoolgirl crush. Do you really think I enjoy being stalked? Are you sure you're not encouraging him? -Just to chase you? -You think I'm egging him on? -Why would I do that? -That's what I've been wondering. And the only answer I can come up with? You're still in love with the man. -I am offended. -Hardly a denial, dear. Can we just talk about something else? -Can you? -It's not happening, mother. I think Jake is very sincere in his desire for a fresh start. He said so Sunday at brunch. The salmon was under par, and believe me, I let them know. -It was just... -You had breakfast with Jake? Brunch, dear. And stop staring at me like your father. Jake and I are only interested in what's best for you. How can you let him use you like this? Is there no depth the man won't stoop to? He loves you. No, he's loathsome. He's egomaniacal. He's a guttersnipe. My darling... My dear, dear girl... Just because there's a spot on the apple... ...doesn't mean you have to throw away the whole thing. Yes, but most of the time, it's just plain, old, rotten to the core. But, Francis, you can't be sure one way or the other... ...unless you take a bite. Now can you? Well... ...what a coincidence. Or a cruel joke. What, did you put a tracking device on my truck? Uh, nah. It's more preferable to put the tracking device on the actual subject, but that means I'd have to get very close. That's never gonna happen. Anyway, nice bumping into you. I'm gonna go take a nice long run. Hey, well, that's exactly what I'm here for. Really? I didn't know you ran. Well, are you implying that I'm out of shape? No, it's just that you're jogging suit still has the price tags on it. Are you gonna wear those headphones the whole time? What'd you say? I said, I thought that maybe we could talk. That's why I put these on. Come on, Frankie. When's the last time we had a real conversation? I think before the restraining order went into effect. Okay, haven't we played enough "pin the fail on Jake" lately? Oh, well, you offer up such a huge target. See? Who makes you laugh like I do, right? Why are you doing this? Doing what? The flowers, acting all cute, following me around like you're with the NSA? Come on, isn't it obvious? How do you get electricity, Frankie? With friction. And there's enough electricity between us to eliminate fossil fuels. Oh, thanks for the science lesson. Come... Hey, come here! Don't you get it? I love you. You are shameless. Look, I never expected to fall in love with you again, but here I was being shooed away by Irma, and I... I looked up and, boom! Honey, you just plain knocked the wind out of me. And that's when I realized that I still loved you. You love me? Yeah, I guess I always have. Why? -Why what? -Why do you love me? A man just said he loved you. -What more do you need? -I need a few specifics. Because I do. Well, but why? -What kind of a question is that? -It's an important question. -Why do you love me? -I just told you! Electricity, and friction, and looking radiant. -That's all you got? -Of course not. Okay, I'm listening. Because you... You say things, and then you... You do things, and then you say... And... I can't define love. Apparently so. Okay, I didn't know I was getting a pop quiz today. Okay, last chance, Jake. I love everything about you. Nice try. Alright, well listen. What do you want me to say? It should be easy for a man with such unbridled passion. Frankie, I'm not Taylor Swift, okay? I just can't put my feelings into words... Are you okay? I think I... I think I sprained my ankle. No, no. Go, go, go on without me. Very well. Let me take a look at it. How does this feel? -Not as good as this. -Stop it. Get off of me, Jake! Frankie, listen to me. There are words that you can't always say, but you feel it between us, don't you? Right now, all I feel is resentment. Frankie, this is right. No. Get... No. Is that a sports bra you're wearing? Damn, that drives me crazy. No, no! Get off! No, Jake. No! When you go to a theme park, you can't just buy a ticket for the rides you like. You have to buy a ticket for the whole park. It's not worth it for me anymore. Frankie, come on. Come on. Frankie, you gotta admit that we were happy. No, you were happy. The kids and I, we were lonely. I thought it would get better, but I guess I was just being naive. Look, you have every right to be angry. You missed so much. You missed so much of your life, so much of ours. And you wanna know what the final straw was? When I did this little number at a PTA benefit... ...and I really wanted you to come to the show, and you kept promising me that you would be there. And at the last minute, you decided you were too tired. Unfortunately, nothing's important unless it's important to you. It's clear that the kids and I will never be your priority, and we deserve so much better. Frankie! How's it going, Mister Jake? Irma, instead of Mister Jake, why don't you call me, "Your Highness?" Because when I'm around you, I feel like a king. Oh, Mister Jake, you're a silver-tongued devil. I don't know how Miss Francis can resist you. Tell me about it. It's like she's wearing a seduction-proof vest. You men! You think everything is about sex! Oh, I don't think it, I know it. What are the most important things to a woman? Oh, I don't know. -Money, chocolate and Mani-pedis? -No! More than anything, a woman wants her man to be a good father. Bart and Alex have different values than you. But they are good people, and you love them. Prove you care. Show Miss Francis you can be a family again. Yeah, what else you got? There you go. Excuse me, excuse me. Hey, thanks so much. You know, I usually don't eat spicy food, but this looks so good, I'll make an exception. Dad, what are you doing here? What, a father can't come by and say hi... ...and take an interest in the good work that his daughter is doing? It's just... Well, I thought you were mad at me. You know, about selling the team and all? Alex, come on. That's just business. I don't take that stuff personally. So, why don't we go for dinner and get some real food? I can't. Mom has her big fundraiser tonight. It's a theme party. We're all getting dressed up in pajamas. Oh, well, that's great. Sounds like a date. I'll pick you up. Move it along, fancy pants. I'm hungry. Take your time, sir. I promise you, you will have more fun than on your seventh-grade cotillion. Hopefully, this time, I won't throw my back out... ...doing the electric slide. Pick me up at 6:00. You got it. Thank you. Excuse me. Thank you so much. Hi. Now, one of our biggest problems is the growth of urban farming, which is sprouting some very negative side effects. We are dedicated to helping abused, abandoned, and neglected animals. Domestic animals, especially farm animals... ...due to past mistreatment would be difficult... -...to place through adoption. -Hi. You won't believe how many abandoned animals... ...are just wandering the streets of Seattle. Pigs and those... ...things with the horns that go "bah". Excuse me. What is so funny? Hi, mom. Look who came as my plus one. How sweet. Dad was just telling us the funniest story. Really? Frankie, you remember when Alex came in to our room that night... ...and her arms were crossed in front of her chest? And she was like, "The movies won't plays no mores." -Right, because... -She put the grilled cheese in the video. Exactly. I don't believe I saw your name on the guest list. Well, I paid at the door. I mean, I overpaid, but, hey, it's for charity, right? What's your angle here, Jake? Other than trying to be a better father, nothing. Hi! You didn't answer my question. Frankie, what is it with you? You chastise me if I don't pay attention to the children, and you chastise me when I do. -Surprise! -Barton! Oh, I didn't think you were coming! Last minute. I caught a ride on my friend's jet. I brought her along. I hope that's okay. -The more, the merrier. -Excellent. She's just outside. She had to make a business call. There's my boy, huh? -Look at you. -Look at that. That's something you didn't think you'd ever see again. I think they're going to get back together. Auntie Portia, I think you're just having a senior moment. Young lady? Would you mind taking a photo? Come on, let's go do a family photo. A family photo? -Come on.- What? Stand right there. Okay, everyone, let's squeeze in. Let's show off those pearly whites your mom and I paid so much money for. Alright, alright. Let's do the... Let's do the pose that Barton did in his seventh-grade yearbook photo. You remember? I'm sorry to take so long, Bartykins. Mom, dad. I think you know my friend here. Oh, not quite as well as I thought. You know, when Barton told me about all the important work that you do, well, I just had to show my support. Hi. Alexandria. Barton's sister. Barton's told me all about you. I admire your charitable spirit. Yours as well, Mrs Cornell. Oh, that's sweet, dear. You know, I was just wondering, how did you and Barton become so close? Well, recently, my new employers, the Bidwell Group, made a substantial investment in Barton's start-up. And we really hit it off. Anyways, Barton has now offered... ...to help champion my firm's purchase of the Cougars. Oh, really? So, you suckered him into backing some lowball offer? Seven hundred million dollars is hardly a lowball offer, Jake. That's right. It's an insult. That's enough, we're not talking business here. No, we are talking business, Frankie, because I am not selling my team. For the last time, the team doesn't belong to you, dad. It belongs to our family. Don't you get it, Barton? This is a swindle. Her and Bunky are not interested... ...in your little disruptive start-up/start-up. Well, the Bidwell Group is supporting my dreams, which is more than I can say for you who takes no interest in what I do. And what you're doing is selling out the family. -Stop it. Everybody is looking. -Okay? And also, I am not sure if you've actually taken this one out on a test drive yet, but in the showroom, she's fabulous. But take her out on the road, and the performance is very disappointing. Maybe she just needed a more skilled driver. Oh, really? I didn't know you had your license. You're just jealous, aren't you, dad? Because I am my own man, and I'm going to be very successful completely on my own, unlike you who just inherited his father's business. Oh, really? I just inherited my...? Well, how would you like me to bequeath you a bloody nose? -Oh, you're gonna hit me? -Yeah! I'm gonna hit you! -This is not happening! -Why don't we step outside, young man? -Yeah... No, no, no! Just... -Alright! Just stop! Just let him go! -Come on! -Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! The most important night of the entire year for me, and what does the man who claims to love me so much do? He humiliates me in front of everyone I know! Yeah, well, maybe one day, you will thank me. Please leave, Jake. But don't you see what's going on here? This woman is luring him into Bunky's little web. I asked you to leave. Please go. Not until we sort this out. -Go! Now! -Not until we work this out! In that case... ...goodnight. Mom. Frankie! Thank you. Hey, you okay? You need help? I can handle this myself, thank you. You know, I don't know why you drive this old heap. It's nothing but problems. -Let me call the auto club. -No. If there was service out here, don't you think I would have called them already? Do you know how to fix a broken carburetor? No. But even if I did, I wouldn't touch anything in there in the middle of the perfect storm. Come on, get in my car before you float away. Don't you get it? It's over. Goodbye. Adios. You fouled out. You are ejected. Banned for life. Let's get out of here. There you go. Thanks for the ride. My pleasure. You're shivering. No, I'm not shivering. I'm just excited to be near you. Come inside the house, we'll get you dried off. No, I can't. -Yes, you can. -Okay. Ooh, I can't wait to get out of these wet clothes. Don't get any ideas. This is purely humanitarian. You got anything to drink around here, Frankie? Have some tea. You'll be leaving soon. That... That was a pretty good fight tonight, huh? What do you consider a good fight? I'm just trying to have a conversation here. No, you're trying to have an argument. -No, I'm not. -Yes, you are. -You keep telling me I like to argue... -Because that's what you always do. I'm just trying to have a conversation and have a little cup of tea. You know what? Let's stop talking for a while, okay? Okay. Though, you gotta admit, we're good at arguing. And we're pretty darn good at making up, too. No comment. Anyway... I'll admit I... ...that I was wrong and... ...I'm sorry about the PTA show thing that I didn't go to. -I feel really bad about it. -Please. You wouldn't have even known about it if I didn't tell you. Which makes it even worse. You know what? I... ...would like to hear you sing a song. That was a one-time-performance only. Come on, come on, come on. Come on. It'll make you feel so much better. This is stupid. We can't erase the past. I just wanna hear it. Please? I'm gonna check the dryer. No, no. Please, Frankie. Please, just sing it once. I don't even remember the words. Then just sing one verse. One verse... Just step right over here, okay? There you go, loosen up. One verse. There was music. There was a guitar player. -And I was wearing a white satin dress... -Yeah, you don't need any of that. Please. All those tears All those years Yet, I can't believe we parted This is goodbye But not farewell I know we'll be together someday And though we've had our trials As all couples do I never thought you'd say we're through Still I pray We'll find a way To be together one day One day One day I love you... ...because you make every day exciting. And I love you, because despite my failings, you're always there for me. And I love you because every time I look in your eyes, I know how good life can be. You're my everything, Francis. Call me Frankie. Hey. Good morning, beautiful. You're making breakfast for me? Well, I was for me, but I guess we can split it 50/50. Just like our divorce. Oh, that's good. Oh, I... I got us... ...a little Bloody Mary. Oh, really, I shouldn't. Come on, we have a lot to celebrate today. -What exactly are we celebrating? -Us. To many more years of bickering. -Cheers. -Cheers. -Alright, grab your breakfast. -Thank you. Wow, beautiful. Here we go. Oh, do you happen to have any of your wedding rings left? No. The first one, I threw into Puget Sound, and the second one, I rolled over with my tractor. That's too bad. They could have come in handy. Wait, wait. You're moving a little too fast. You wanna get married again? Oh, yeah, don't you? We'll jump off that bridge when we get to it. But first, we have a few issues we need to resolve. Like which religion to raise our children in? That's very funny. No, I'm talking about the team. Well, there's no problems, because we're not selling the team anymore. What do you mean? Well, we're back together again, so the sale is just a moot point. Really? So you'll just go back to running the team again? Yeah. Yeah, of course. -And where does that leave me? -Frankie, come on. You've had your fun, but play time is over. What about all the improvements I made? Improvements? Okay, Big-Shot, I'll give you that one, good idea. But come on, no one comes to the arena to have a designer hot dog. -And those uniforms? -I like the uniforms. It looks like the team just stepped out of a Grateful Dead concert. -Really? -Yes. The Seattle Cougars have proudly worn the same uniform since 1948. And the team has been dead last in merchandising sales. I don't care about merchandise. I care about winning. Well, you are losing this argument. You call this an argument? A grown man throwing a little hissy fit over something he has no control over? What do you call it? You know, I really think that the Botox is finally getting to your brain. -Now this is an argument. -Okay, look. I'm just saying that I think that maybe these new uniforms... -Really? -...are the wrong color... I can't believe that I thought we could get back together. Oh, come on... Okay, you know what? Maybe the 36 hours that we spent the last time... -...didn't work out either. -Get out, Jake. I want my team back. You mean, my team? Out! Frankie! I'll see you in court! Welcome. We thank the plaintiff, Mr Cornell, for letting us use his lovely home. So over the top. Not yet, Mrs Cornell. So, in order to expedite a resolution... ...to a matter of great importance to both sides, you have agreed to binding arbitration. I am a former probate judge... ...who has been appointed as the sole arbiter. And my decision will be final and not subject to appeal. Please remember that, although we are in a casual setting, the rules of the court still apply. Are both sides clear on this? -Crystal, Your Honor. -Agreed. Alright. Let's play ball. Morning, Jake. How are you doing today? Oh, besides the constant pain... ...of being betrayed by my best friend since college, just great. Your Honor, I move to declare Mr Cornell a hostile witness. I have no objection with that, Your Honor. And you have no standing in that decision. You may treat him as such. So, Mr Cornell. How many years has your family had ownership of the Seattle Cougars? Are you going to ask a lot of questions that everybody knows the answer to? This isn't Jeopardy, sir. One doesn't answer a question with a question here. Sixty-seven distinguished years. And over the past quarter century, I have succeeded my grandfather and father in providing stability and leadership... ...while steering our team and family trust to record revenue. Oh, goodness. Let's try to remain civil, please. But in all that time, you haven't raised many championship banners, have you? As a matter of fact, for the past six years, the team hasn't even made the playoffs. Well, we've had some bad luck and injuries. Plus, it's very hard for a smaller market team... ...to compete for the top free agents. So in other words, you're not promising a winning season... ...this year or any time soon. Now, you say you've had a lot of injuries, but it seems to me that it's your fans... ...that have been hurt the worst. Are you gonna let him get away with these shenanigans? Objection, Your Honor. The team's record is not germane to this inquiry. Well, as a season ticket holder, it's of great interest to me. Overruled. So, Mr Cornell. Ten years ago, you fired Chuck Thompson, the head coach with the second-best winning percentage of all time. Why? We didn't see eye-to-eye. Then I guess you didn't see eye-to-eye... ...with the five other head coaches you've had this past decade. Four directors of scouting, three general managers, and... ...forty-two assistant coaches. -I object. -You can't. Well, then you object! To what, exactly? He's making it out like I don't get along with anybody, you stuffed skirt! Mister Cornell! I quit. I think you've shown us all we need to see. No more questions, Your Honor. I... Your Honor, if it pleases the court, I guess it's obvious I don't have my own legal council. I ask that I be allowed to represent myself. Very well. Thank you. Now, Barton. Can you tell us what the contents of this bag are? Yes, those were two independent reports that I had commissioned... ...on behalf of the family trust. And what exactly was your father's reaction to these findings? I think that's evident. How would you characterize your relationship with your father? I don't know. I used to see him going through the locker room... ...hugging all the players and telling them how proud he was of them. And wishing he felt the same way about me. And after this seven-foot, 300-pound Russian gentleman... ...kicked you in the head, you had to be transported to the hospital in an ambulance. That's right. And your father did not accompany you, did he? No. Because the game had gone into double overtime. I used to love May because that's when the season ended... ...and he'd be home more. And even when he was home, he was always restless... ...waiting for training camp to start. I believe he thinks that we're trying to sell the team to hurt him. And, deep down, maybe we are. Your witness. Actually, I don't know about you, but I'm getting a little hungry. Let's recess for one hour. Having a rough day, I hear. The most important job in my life and I threw up an air ball. God, I'm such an idiot. You know, I figured I'd just waltz back in, get Frankie to fall head over heels in love with me, the kids would forgive me, and we'd be one big happy family again. Instead, I realized how badly I blew it. You sure have. You know the worst thing about losing your family is? Realizing you never deserved them in the first place. What did you do that for? Because you're being a pathetic loser! When your team is behind, do you quit? No! You dig deep and fight for what's yours! Irma, we've sailed way too far past that buoy to turn this ship around. Do you love them? Of course I love them. I wanted to be a good father and husband. I just... I just never got the hang of it. But the truth is, that Frankie and the kids, they mean more to me than anything in the world. Then show them! Save your family. I've done too much irreparable harm. It's too late. If you truly love them, you go back in there, show them what's in your heart. And win them back. Yes! Your witness, Counselor. Thank you, Your Honor. I don't admire the portrait that's been painted of me here today. And you've all caused me to take a... ...a long hard look at myself... ...and the damage that my misplaced priorities... ...have caused to the people that I care about the most. Alex, Barton... ...I can't change the past, and I know that I can't do any worse going forward, but I do know that in my heart... ...I can be much, much better. You have every reason not to believe me, but... ...I love you both. And in the time that we have left together, I want to be a better and more understanding father. And I want you both to feel that we are a family. And if the only way for me to prove what my family means to me... ...is to sell this team, then... ...go ahead. Give it away, for all I care. Thank you, Your Honor. Mrs Cornell, are you tired of people asking... ...if you know anything about basketball? I've sat through hundreds of games, but I still can't explain the continuation rule. Can you, Your Honor? Not exactly. I don't know much about triangle offenses or triple doubles, but I do know that this is a city filled with good people... ...begging to be inspired by a team that shares their character, who aspires to be the best. And I don't believe that was possible under the former management. So you believe that it's in the best interest of the city and the team... ...to find a new owner? Not just for the city but for our family. My ex-husband always talks about how the Cougars are a family business, but his actions have excluded the family from the business. Actions, which, like everything else, he has never accepted responsibility for. Nothing further. Frankie, wait! What about telling the kids? I'll do it. They might be relieved. Us being together again really freaked them out. Yeah, I'll... ...have the team issue a press release and fax it over for your approval. Okay. Make sure you see a doctor. You might need some stitches. Yeah. Don't worry about that. Time heals all wounds, right? Yeah. -I guess this is it. -Yeah. Yeah, at least we won't have to wonder anymore. -Can't say we didn't try. -No. No. Mister Cornell? Mister Cornell? I said, your witness, Mr Cornell. Missis Cornell, can you tell the court... Did we have a happy marriage? What do you want me to say, Jake? That every moment we spent together was nothing but utter bliss? That you were a wonderful father and a doting husband? Sorry, but I'm under oath. And yet, you married me a second time. Regrettably. And recently, you and I had a very memorable night... ...filled with passion, romance, and... -...tender, sweaty... -Objection. And objectionable. I'll rephrase, Your Honor. Missis Cornell, there's a preponderance of evidence... ...to suggest that you are very attracted to me. The question I want to know is, why? I've asked myself that many times. And for good reason. I mean, obviously, I'm very handsome. And I have a masculine vitality and confidence... Better not get too close. I may not be able to control myself. But would you also agree that I can often be self-centered, difficult, impulsive, opinionated and somewhat combative? I'd say more constantly than often. And as a result of those factors, I occasionally can make some mistakes. Sometimes, real whoppers. But the biggest mistake I've ever made... ...was letting you leave that cabin that night. I'm so sorry, Frankie. Come back. Relevance, Your Honor? Hang on now. This is just like the telenovela I saw last night. Keep going, Mr Cornell. Rather than even trying to take a shot at becoming the man... ...that you obviously believe I can be, I had the ball in my hands. And I let the clock run out. But if you can see clear to giving me a second shot, I promise you that I will not disappoint... ...because I love you so much. But all of this means nothing... ...if you don't feel the same way about me. Francis Cornell... ...can you see clear to love me again? Objection, council is asking the witness to draw a conclusion. Sustained. No further questions, Your Honor. Thank you, Mrs Cornell. Thank you. Your Honor, at this time, the defense rests his case. -What? -I need you to bring Jake... ...back up to the stand. Uh, correction. At this time, the defense would like to recall to the stand Mr Jake Cornell. "The court is touched by your heartfelt confessions," "but given your history, why should we believe anything you said?" I'm not asking to be judged from the past... ...but from what I do from here on out. Excuse me, Your Honor. I think it would just be easier for everyone... ...if I questioned the witness myself. I guess it's "Everyone Can Be A Lawyer Day." Proceed. So, Mr Cornell. Do you recall how you received that small scar on your right little finger? Yes, you confused my finger for a Cobb salad. And what would cause me to do something so out of character? Well, I told you that I wanted to try to be a better man. You said to quit lying to myself... ...and then you punctuated that with your teeth. So, do you think you're being honest with yourself now? I am. I've lived with you and I've lived without you. And life is definitely better with you. And you're not just saying all these things... ...because you think that's what the court wants to hear? No. I'm saying them from my heart. Even if it means losing the Cougars? Frankie, it... Francis, losing the team means nothing to me... ...compared to losing my family. Well, then, Mr Cornell... Jake, given everything we've heard in this room today, how would I know that you would do your utmost... ...to live up to the promises you made today? I pinky swear. It's been nice. Good morning, and thank you all for coming. As of today, I will be sharing responsibility... ...for day-to-day operations with my bride-to-be, again, Francis Cornell. Our team has a great history, but our future is going to be even brighter... ...because the Cougars are going to be playing... ...in a completely refurbished arena. That's right, new concessions, better sight lines, ergonomic seats and a 400-room hotel. Also, as of today, Seattle fans across America can follow their team exclusively on CTN. The Cougar Television Network. That's right, we've acquired from the Bidwell Group... ...a total of 28 TV stations... ...to broadcast every home and away game... ...to millions of new Cougars fans across the country. And who better to oversee this bold expansion... ...than the architect of the acquisition himself, our son, Barton Cornell. I'm so proud of you. Good job, son. Now, the Cougars organization and the Cornell family... ...owe a great debt to this community. And what better way to repay that debt... ...than to help lift and inspire those less fortunate? So to accomplish this, we have formed Cougars Care. Our team will lead the league in a new statistic. Charitable donations. And it's MVP will be our daughter, Alexandria Cornell. Now the Cougars may not win every game. No one does. But I will promise you... ...that not only will we be great on the court... ...but also in the owner's box. And I love to entertain, so I'm inviting you and your family to the biggest party of the year. And the best part about it? It goes all season. So... Let's hear those Cougars roar Roar Fight Fight Fight Together, we'll win today Together, we'll win today
