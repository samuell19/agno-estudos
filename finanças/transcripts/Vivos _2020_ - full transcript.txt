I once dreamt about my son, but he wasn’t dead. He was alive. He was sitting inside a house. And that’s it. Almost four years without knowing anything about him. Without knowing how he is, how he’s being treated, if he’s sleeping or not sleeping, whether he eats or not. It’s such a huge despair. The father of my children left us. My son was four, my little girl three, and my oldest daughter seven. He went to work in the U.S. for a few months and then he forgot about us. So I was thinking about going there to work as well. It was very difficult for me, because I didn’t speak English. I worked for six months to pay off the debt for crossing the border. I had to pay 2,000 dollars. In September it started getting cold. So I got a job at Burger King. I worked more than 15 hours a day, seven days a week, and never took a day off. I slept three or four hours every night. And that is what I did for four years, sending money to my children, so that they wouldn’t miss anything. When I got back, everything was calm. I explained to them why I had left, and they understood. I’d sit down with them and tell them how I worked. I know they suffered because I wasn’t here, but I told them it was so we could have a house. Because if I didn’t work, who was going to build them a house? He said, “I have to be somebody in life because... “you have looked after us. “You’ve worked hard for us. “So I’ll become a teacher, “so that when you’re old I can look after you, “like you looked after me.” Since my son Mauricio disappeared in 2014, our life has become very difficult. We no longer feel joy. Before this happened, I used to go to the orchard in the afternoon, I would clean and cut weeds, and only get back home at night. But I was happy because I knew that my children were studying, and that they would become someone in the future. But since this happened in 2014, four years have passed and we no longer feel the same. I always think of my son when I walk or work alone. He likes working in the field. I have been teaching him things in the field. How to cut coffee, how to move the dirt, how to take care of the goats. But he told me he would rather do other things. He told me, “I will keep on studying.” And I said, “Make an effort, otherwise you’ll stay here as a peasant.” His clothes are here, his tools, his books and notebooks as well. What shall I do? He’s not here with us. He left all his things when he left. He didn’t have any money. I don’t know which world he is in. We asked him if school was difficult, because people said it was hard. Then we asked him if he really wanted to go, and he said yes. Now it’s almost four years since it happened. We don’t know anything about him, not a single word. We ask if anyone knows anything. We want him to return alive. Our priest says he’s alive, and we believe that. I’ve always worked the field. Plain work. Time went by and the kids grew up. Now they’re mostly grown-ups. Most of them have their own families. It makes me happy that they have remained close through all these things. We live in this house. We all live in this house. We all work to get ahead. We grow corn, hibiscus... We all help out at home. Everything we do, we do to make ends meet. He was always good with words. And he wanted to be a teacher. Now there is not much hope that he will get back to 100%, like we are. At the hospital in Iguala, the diagnosis they gave us was terrible. They said that Aldo was in a vegetative state, that he was brain-dead. We never agreed with that, because we could see Aldo alive, breathing. He was moving. We said that it was not possible that Aldo was brain-dead. None of us in the family ever agreed with that diagnosis. We can’t be sure that he will be like this forever. There might be some good reactions once he’s here, with his family. It will also make us happier, being near him, spending time with him. It will make us happy to have him here so that his other siblings can see him as well. I rarely go there. I don’t... I don’t want to see him often in this state. I feel bad. The way he used to be... I couldn’t accept that he was like this, because he was very smart. Now, he is like this. Sometimes I don’t sleep at night. I think and think and think, and can’t sleep, sometimes until dawn comes. I asked the doctor to give me something to sleep. He gave me sleeping pills. If I don’t take the pills, I can’t sleep at all. We left our house four years ago. We went to live with my mother in her house. We haven’t lived here for four years. My wife got sick. Well, they have all suffered. We are missing two. When we come here, we feel like they’re here. I look at the pictures. Doriam is right there in the middle. Jorge Luis as well. We then start to think about them, and that hurts. It makes us feel bad. The house is dirty now, because we don’t come to clean. It just stays the same. Before it was clean, not like this. Before it was all clean. I don’t feel like cleaning it. What should I clean it for if we don’t live here? Everything has changed because my children are not here anymore. I try to stay strong. To keep going. Otherwise we will all end up like that. No one would encourage the other. Ayotzinapa is a political school. The school always opposes politicians, those who line their pockets, and those who screw people over. This school is part of Mexico. Teacher training schools in rural areas were created for low-income people. We’re neither vandals nor criminals. We fight for the people. We are with the people. And it was because we stand up for our rights and demand justice, that they gave the order to kill us. The government is afraid of Ayotzinapa. Because we won’t be silent. We are human rights defenders. My son would say to me, “I want to be somebody. I want people to notice me. “I want you to be proud of me. “To be somebody, to be... “To be a teacher. “I want that... “when I walk with my grandma, people will say ‘there comes a teacher’.” Our only legacy is what we can give our children. I dropped out of high school. If I had had the opportunity to have a good job, and to bring money home, perhaps Christian would be here with us. Or he could have gone to another school. That day, we didn’t know anything at all. But that Friday night, around one o’clock, my phone rang. It was a call from over there. I answered, but I could only hear a sound as if they were breaking bottles, like glass. It sounded terrifying, and I was wondering at the moment, “What is going on?” I thought it could be my brother-in-law’s nephew who had been drinking. But I couldn’t be sure. I told my husband, “My phone rang and it sounds terrible.” We answered but they didn’t say anything. I was saying, “Hello, hello, hello?!” And then they hung up. I thought, “What is going on?” He texted me, “You know what? “The police are shooting at us, things are getting very ugly.” And then... “I hope I will survive this, because I think I might lose my life here.” And I wrote, “How can you say that? Losing your life?! “I need you to get out of there! “Think of yourself, think of your baby daughter!” “No, I can’t. I can’t leave. My friends are here. “I can’t just leave.” “Well, then, be very careful. And please keep me updated.” That was at around nine that night. By ten, when the family gathering was over, I took our baby daughter upstairs. She just wouldn’t stop crying, and I couldn’t... I couldn’t make her stop. She was in such a terrible mood. And I was trying to text him again, but he wasn’t replying anymore. I called, but he didn’t pick up. I was terribly worried that night. In the last text he sent me, he asked me to look after our daughter. I fell asleep for a little bit. Then the church bells rang, so I went to pray. I came back home, I washed my tortilla dough and went to the mill. But we were not aware of anything at all. Nothing, nothing but that phone call. Around four in the afternoon, a friend of my son came. He asked me, “Mrs. Socorro, has Iván called you?” I said, “No, why?” He said, “Nothing, I’m just asking.” But I felt something in my heart. I said, “No, please tell me. Do you know something?” He said, “No, I don’t know anything.” I said, “No, tell me. Don’t leave me wondering.” He said, “I’m going to tell you, but don’t be scared.” I said, “No, but why?” “My mom was selling stuff in Ayutla, “and she heard something on the news. “They were saying that something bad happened in Iguala. “She told me that some students from Ayotzinapa were killed.” The next day, Saturday the 27th, I kept calling his phone, but it kept sending me to voicemail. So I started to check on social media. I sat down, looked at the picture, analyzing it, looking at his clothes, his jeans, his tennis shoes. And I said, “It can’t be... “It can’t be! It can’t be Julio César!” In that photo, he had one of his hands on his abdomen, and he had marks, like scars, like little circles, and that was the hand he had there. When I told my mom, “It’s Julio César. It’s Julio!” She said, “No, honey, relax. It’s not Julio. “We’ll find a way to get in touch with him, “to find out where Julio is.” And I said, “No, it’s Julio! It’s Julio César! “He had those marks here. “How could they do that to him?” Honestly, the first day when they told us, we had no money at all. Nothing, absolutely nothing, not even five cents, we had nothing. So my dad and my mom tried to find money so they could go all the way there. In those days of anguish we couldn’t eat at all, we couldn’t sleep at all, only wondering where they were, if they were all right, if they ate, drank water, if something had happened to them. We knew nothing, absolutely nothing. Three days later, they announced the names of those murdered, but nothing about the others. At first, they said it was 52 students, then they said no, it was 43. And 43 it remained. They stated they were only 43 boys. And one of them was my brother, one of my brothers. He always wanted to be a teacher. He used to tell his high school teachers and his friends, “I’m going to become a teacher. “I’ll teach your children. “And I’m going to slap them around so they’ll learn.” One of his friends says that he would tell her, “I don’t want a sad classroom. “I’m going to have fun with my students.” My phone was out of credit, so I went down to my sister’s house because they had a phone. Then I went back up to wait for my husband. I told him to take a taxi home as fast as he could. I didn’t tell him when he was at work. I told him when he got home. We went to the taxi stop, to ask how much they’d charge us to take us as soon as possible to Coyuca, where his sister was waiting for us. People asked me what I was going to do, and I said, “I’m going to the school, to ask what happened to my son. “Perhaps he’s there.” There, I told them, “I’m here to see my son.” “What’s your son’s name?” a young man asked. “Benjamín Ascencio Bautista.” He looked for him in his notebook and said, “He’s missing along with other classmates, “but don’t worry, we’re looking for them. We’ll find them.” I went to the basketball court. There was a crowd of people there. Women were crying. And I asked, “What happened to the boys?” A woman from Tixtla told me, “The police took them. They got them.” We went to that investigation with our eyes wide open, seeing all the possibilities. In the way they had investigated the case there was an interest of detaining a lot of people to show that something was being done. But there’s always this tendency to investigate at low ranks and not go higher beyond that, only the material people involved. And this is a case that must be investigated through all the different levels of hierarchy that are involved. In this operation, who was involved? It was directly operated by, directly performed by civilians, armed civilians, but also by local police. But it was protected, the whole operation was under surveillance and under the protection of larger bodies of police. Like state police, federal police, and even the Mexican army. The cellphones of the students were active way after the hour that the government says that the students were burned in the dump, which we said that this was scientifically and physically impossible, with evidence, scientific evidence, that this could not have happened. And besides, you had activity from the cellphones after that time, so... in the whole ‘historic truth’ that they had said that was what happened, we were convinced that what happened wasn’t what they were telling people and the victims. The group of experts that came in 2015 worked with the government pretty well for about six months, but then it started to challenge the government’s version of what had happened. This so-called ‘historic truth.’ They proved that a bone fragment from one of the students that was supposedly found on a certain day had actually been planted by the prosecutor in the case the day before, in a plastic bag, ‘to be found.’ They proved that the military and the federal police were involved in this operation. Once the group of experts began to get closer and closer to both demolishing the government version and demanding access to evidence that would actually help them unravel this case, the government decided to close the door on them and said, “Your time is up. And get out.” Unfortunately, since our mandate was not renewed we weren’t able to investigate more to determine what happened and break that circle of impunity. I don’t think that the authorities really know what happened. I think they want to close the case so they can, as sometimes authorities and states say, ‘move on.’ Which is absolutely a mistake. Human rights violations don’t go away unless you address them properly. First, making the victims participate in the truth-telling process and in the investigations. You can’t impose a truth upon victims. Because they will never accept it. We’re peasants. We have land, we have farms. As a community, we have everything we need to work the soil. My son is part of the community. I miss him as my son and my helper in the field. Some people here grow sugarcane or coffee, or milpas. We help each other when we have crops. It makes work easier. But the land is too large without my son. We need people who have studied, who can speak Spanish, educated people. There are not many of us. He is our only son, and we never imagined this would happen. If the people who took him want to be good, may their hearts be so big that they will return our son. We love our children just as they love their own children. I think now that the corn field has begun to sprout, the one I just fertilized, we can go through it again with the machete, maybe even spray it again, so it’ll be ready. What did they do? What happened? That’s what we’re asking. The Argentinians went to the trash dump, picked everything up, and sent it to Innsbruck to get studied. Everything, every little part. It turned out that it wasn’t the truth, this story they had fabricated. The ‘historic truth.’ There were burned remains from previous years. They found some human molars there, but they were not from the boys. It’s all just lies that they were taken there. That night, it rained, and rained, and rained. Day and night! It doesn’t make any sense. How could it be lit up? It was raining! Firewood and fire, a bonfire, an immense bonfire to incinerate the 43. No, it’s impossible. The first thing they told us was that they were dead. But they couldn’t fool us, because there was no sign that it was them in any of the mass graves in Iguala. Then they made up the story about the fire, which was also a lie. They couldn’t deceive us. We are farmers. About the fire, we know how much a fire can burn. It couldn’t have been just a small fire, it had to be big. It couldn’t even burn down a chicken, let alone so many people. It’s impossible! And also the rain, it was raining the whole night. We understand that there are bad people. But when bad people kill someone, they ditch them. The government doesn’t. They take them away, and if they do something to them, they hide them. That’s why we can’t find them. We don’t know what they have done to our children. Because if it hadn’t been the government who took our children, we would have already found them, one way or another. You put some palm leaves on top and you don’t have to light it up again. The fire will get going by one or two p.m. The damned government destroyed our lives. They must tell us what happened. We demand from the government to tell us where my son is, where his friends are. Sometimes a day goes by, another day, they pile up. Now they’ve turned into years. The truth is that we don’t know what to do anymore. It’s not that I’m afraid. I’ve left fear behind me. What I have now is anger. There’s anger inside me. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to experience the most spectacular sport in the history of Mexico, called Lucha Libre! 42% of American continental production of heroin comes from that region and has to go through Iguala to be hidden in buses and taken to the U.S. border. The conclusion many of us have, why they were attacked that night was, when they were taking buses, they mistakenly took the wrong bus in which some heroin packages, very, very valuable, and these packages can be worth one, two, three million dollars, one of these packages was concealed in this bus. So when the cartel tried to take it back they attacked the students. What could possibly provoke those kinds of orders and this kind of political risk? What could possibly be worse than the federal government saying that the police in this city collaborate with the drug cartels to incinerate students? That the drug traffickers aren’t the gang members, they aren’t like the typical image of the narco, with the cowboy boots and the cowboy hat, what have you. No. It’s the municipal police from three different cities, it’s the state police, it’s the federal police and it’s the entire structure of the justice system of the Mexican federal government protecting them. That’s how we live in the countryside, in the provinces. We’re farmers. We’re workers. We work the land. But we’re not harvesting what the government says. They cover up the criminals because it’s drugs that they’re involved with. And that’s where you make the most profit. They don’t support agriculture, or us sowing the land, because that’s worthless to them. The profit for them is in drugs, from which they benefit the most. There’s a lot of money in that, whereas corn has no value. How much can one really get from corn? As we say, we cannot be calm. Our minds can’t. One starts thinking. I remember when I used to come here and work together with my boy. He would help me over there. When I come, I think of him. I feel so awful. Sometimes I think I shouldn’t come. It takes some time before I come back. And I still remember well. It’s sad, what we’re going through. The young people who disappeared, those 43 students, come from very poor and marginalized indigenous peasant communities. Over time, the relatives of the 43 have, unfortunately, understood that a forced disappearance is a very long road, and that they need to join other groups along that road, to build bridges and relationships. The ‘historic truth’ was also in the media, on TV, showing images, discussing how the students had been handled. So our society was also manipulated and lied to. The manipulation of the truth caused a lot of pain and hurt, making it worse for the families. It also deepened public mistrust of the state. Not only because the authorities had been involved in the deed, but because they kept hurting them with this ‘historic truth.’ So of course the relationship between the families and the government is tainted. I think it affects the way we live in society, because... not only is trust in the state broken, but also the way we engage with each other, because all relationships are marked by fear. Open the doors. Why are you closing them? People need you, they must be open. That’s why all citizens are angry, because we come to have you support us, and you don’t want to help us. You closed the doors already. Good afternoon, friends. We are here at the Attorney General’s Office. It’s already been 47 months that we are fighting. It was a coordinated act, in which three students were killed and 43 others disappeared. How can they tell us that our children were taken by organized crime, when both reports from the experts suggest very clearly that it was the army who handled it? We are here asking the Attorney General’s Office to accept our demands. So we’re saying it out loud now to reach their ears: We will not give up until we find our children. That is what we demand as parents. I want to thank you all: The students who are here with us, and the media. Thank you all for being here. Because they took them alive! Alive we want them back! It’s impossible to explain the case of the 43 without questioning why the authorities intervened, either to commit crimes themselves or to allow other authorities or criminal groups to commit them. The police and the army are not subjected to standards of democratic control. We call it accountability, to better explain it to the world. The police and the army are not accountable, especially for the way they use force. Democracy is not possible, there is no democratic rule of law if there are no records, no paperwork, no assessment, no supervision, and no accountability for the use of force. The army and police use force across the whole country every day, without a proper documentation system. And this implies that anything can happen. There is no evidence that the most important ministers are directly involved with the heroin trade. But if they are not involved, at least they don’t stop it. They don’t want to stop it. And they don’t, they don’t make sure that their subordinates stop it. There is a chain of people from Guerrero to the border who are involved with it. And this is all sorts of officials and officers. And they are doing it. No one goes to jail for this. No one is processed. There are no judicial processes against these people. We said, “It’s not possible that Aldo’s brain is dead.” We wanted Aldo to be the same again. So we started to look around for help. The only ones we were able to contact were doctors from Cuba. We asked our lawyers to support us on this, including getting the Cuban doctors to come see him in the hospital. They examined him, and they reassured us that there is still a lot we can do for Aldo, that Aldo should be at home, in a familiar environment. We decided to build a house here in order to protect Aldo. The doctors said it wasn’t advisable for him to be in the hospital for a long time, because he could get a viral infection. There are many diseases there. That’s what we must watch out for. That’s why we decided to build the house here. I feel like it will be a miracle from God, if my son wakes up. We all believe that he will wake up. We all believe that he wants to wake up. But slowly, not right away, but in the future, perhaps in eight years. It could have been me. Well, it was very difficult. We weren’t going to do anything bad. We weren’t going to do anything bad, and I trust that those responsible will pay for it. Do you remember what the rights of children are? Yes. What are they? Raise your hands. The right to have clothes. The right to have shoes. The right to have a family. Teacher, teacher... Teacher, teacher... The right to dress ourselves, that’s correct. The right to nutrition. The right to nutrition, as well, to eat. These are some of the rights of children. But remember that we also have obligations. What are the obligations of children? At home... Make the beds. Sweep the floor. Help our mothers. Where are they? Where are they? Where are our children? This day is one of fight and protest! This is not a day of celebration, it’s one of fight and protest! This is not a day of celebration. Every year, more mothers join on a day on which the miracle of life should be celebrated, the wonderful gift of being a mother. However, we are gathered here in our pain. Because they took them alive! Alive we want them back! Because they took them alive! Alive we want them back! Now, now, it becomes essential... We demonstrated, and a lot of people joined, and I thank them all. But even so, they still don’t take us into account, as if they didn’t see us. I don’t know what else we can do. We fasted for the 43, we did sit-ins, we were at the Office of the Attorney General for a sit-in of 27 days. We were at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, we chained ourselves outside the Ministry of Interior. But even so, it’s as if they didn’t see us. Once, when he came home for a vacation from the teaching school, he said, “Mom.” I asked, “What?” He asked, “Have you been crying?” I wondered and asked, “Why?” He said, “Because I felt it, that you were crying.” That’s why sometimes I restrain my sad feelings, because I feel like he can feel what I feel. This is why I try not to feel sad, and to send him good energy, because one day he will return. I haven’t been able to make money to pay the bills. Sometimes I want to work, but if I do, I won’t be at ease. I won’t be at ease because other parents are fighting, yelling out on the street, “They took them alive, and alive we want them back.” What if I go out to work and my son comes back? I wouldn’t be able to face him. He’d ask why I didn’t keep fighting. I feel a bit better when I participate in activities. Because when I go out, I don’t think about him all the time. Of course I remember my son because he’s never far from my mind. But when I’m out, I feel a little better. When I’m home, it’s like somebody is locking me up and not letting me out. That’s why I’ve been participating. My children say, “If you don’t feel well, don’t go.” But I can’t stay here. I have to go, because if I stay at home I feel worse. It feels good to keep on fighting, with more strength. These days when we get together, all the parents of the 43, we’re united. We give each other the courage to keep on fighting. We won’t accept that the government doesn’t return our children to us. They have to hand the 43 students back to us. That’s why I feel well, happy. But also pissed off, because of the damned government’s actions. Eternal Father, Mother, who are here today, I give to you because I know you’re present all day. Because you’re there every day. The days you take care of all your children. Especially in this house, we beg you day after day. In their house, I show you this shadow. You will destroy all pain and poverty. That’s why this is done, to destroy evils from the root. Hence the offering I place at your hands and feet, Lord Jesus Christ. This is what I offer so they go away, so they take and drink the offerings here. May this make them forget. That’s why I give you from my hands, my Father, on this Friday afternoon, as the sun sets. Here you have to drink what I give to you. You, Lord Jesus Christ. You, eternal Father. You who watches over all your children, Lord Jesus Christ. My Father, eternal Father. Mother light, you’re with me now, where I deliver my words, where I place my offering. May not too much time pass, eternal Father. That’s right, my Father. That’s right, my Mother. Here you have what we give to you. This offering, eternal Father. That’s how the custom goes, created by men and women a long time ago. They implemented it, and that’s why I give you this now. In adversity and in sadness, men and women practiced it. This cures the sick. These are the customs that we keep until this day. That’s why I offer this to you this afternoon. What loneliness I’m feeling because I can’t see you anymore. I ask myself where you are, Mom. I still dream about you being different. Where could you be? I know you don’t forget about your children who love you. Because God is by your side, Mom. Oh, how sad I am without seeing you. This day is very important. The objective of hanging the cross is to have more rain. Since there are people who have cattle, this way they can have enough water for their animals. It’s a tradition of the family and my son Christian Alfonso Rodríguez Telumbre. It’s also a part of our struggle, joining the celebration, to support our family, by carrying out the tradition. This is the reason for the Holy Cross Feast. Peeled shrimp you want, peeled shrimp I give you. Peeled shrimp you prefer, with sauce and lime. Peeled shrimp you want, peeled shrimp I give you. Peeled shrimp you prefer, with sauce and lime. This bedroom is for those who will live here. Oh yes, for Aldo’s nurses. They’re going to take this room. They must be close to him. The living room won’t end up there? Or will it? We’re going to change everything. We’re going to move everything. About the furniture, up until now... That day the supervisor came, I told him that the level needs to be adjusted. He’s sleeping deeply. Right now? She said, “You are leaving with Aldo from here.” It’s a house, not a clinic. Well, a clinic house, but where only one patient will be treated, not many. It’s for one patient. It is going to be his clinic and his house, where he’ll live. In the sky and in the sea. In the sky and in the sea. My astuteness distinguishes me. My astuteness distinguishes me. In order to win. In order to win. Today I am in the SEMISA. Today I am in the SEMISA. I’m with those who believe that policies against drugs produce more violence than drugs themselves, and that policies against drugs produce more harm than drugs themselves. Mexico has signed everything the U.S. has drawn up, in terms of international agreements to go after drugs and organized crime. That has put us in a particularly dire position because we haven’t diminished the power of organized crime and instead we have fragmented criminal groups in this country. Whoever says that increased military intervention is an adequate response to diminish violence in Mexico is lying. There’s no evidence supporting this. However, the Center of Investigations and Economic Teachings has published a study showing that where there’s military intervention, there is an increase in homicidal violence. But the poverty in Mexico, the effects of the drug war in Mexico, that simply doesn’t... come into the calculations of the United States policy towards this country when their focus is on the drug war. And the drug war has provided the Mexican military, the Mexican police, with sophisticated weaponry, with helicopters, with training and with intelligence. And it continues to do so. So the United States is just as much a part of this problem as the organized criminals and the Mexican government itself. Justice! They took them alive! Alive we want them back! There are thousands of family members that are missing, thousands of families that don’t know where their loved ones are, that came from Chihuahua, from Juárez, from Guadalajara, from the entire country, from Mexico City, from all the different states. I thought, “There are so many injustices, “but it’d be good if all of us here came together, “and demanded that the government returns them all alive. “Everyone together, “because on our own, we’re not listened to.” We the parents want to tell you that we will not surrender. It’s very painful to remember the night of September 26, 2014, when our children were attacked, in a coordinated manner. The government was aware of this because the Mexican army was overseeing the C4 surveillance center. The students had been monitored since they left the school of Ayotzinapa. In the beginning, I thought that if he were missing, there would be hope to see him again, like the other parents who are now fighting. They don’t lose hope of their children returning, alive. Sometimes I’d prefer to be waiting like that. They have the hope of hugging them again. We’re just wondering what happened, are they alive or not? If your son had already been killed, you’ve seen him dead. He’s right there. His remains are there. If it’s him, at least you can bring him flowers, light him a candle. That’s our people’s tradition. You can say, “He’s right here.” But when you just don’t know anything... Don’t look at Mexico as being unique or alone in the production of horror. It’s producing it, and it’s producing it right here and right now. But look at the United States. Look at the war against Iraq. Wasn’t it all lies? Wasn’t it fake evidence? Didn’t it produce false documents? How many hundreds of thousands of people did they kill? How much human suffering did they produce through lies, and through the oil trade? So don’t look at Mexico through some kind of exotic lens. The United States is doing the same thing on a scale that is overwhelming. That’s something that I think is the counterbalance to impunity in Mexico: It’s the courage of civil society. The courage of the families, to march and demand and meet with government officials and bang on doors and hold up signs and not give up. The courage of the human rights lawyers to go to court time and time again fighting for this case, and other cases. This is maybe the only positive outcome of this kind of terrible time that Mexicans are living right now. He is here, alive. I always remember him and have him on my mind, dancing, reading... Taking the broom from my hands, sweeping, washing the dishes, going to school. That’s how I remember my son. For me, my son is alive. And I’m going to find him, together with his friends. I promised him that I will fight for justice. If he were in my place, he would have done the same, seek the truth and justice, to find out what happened to him. Now I’m sitting here, doing this interview. I’m in these shoes in which, if it were up to me, I wouldn’t want to be. I’d like to be in Mexico City, for a weekend, with my daughter and her father, enjoying all the wonderful things we had planned for her, for ourselves. But now I’m here. I wouldn’t like anyone to be sitting here, doing an interview about something so ugly and so painful. Remember? What was your father’s name? Remind me. Julio César Mondragón Fontes. Slowly. Julio César Mondragón... No, slowly, not like... Because I don’t understand you. Julio César Mondragón Fontes. And you? What? What is your name? Julio... Your name is not Julio!
