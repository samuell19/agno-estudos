[uplifting music] ♪ ♪ If they want to raise the prices on us, tell them we'll find a different manufacturer. [office din] Yeah, we have 12,000 pieces in production. That's why they're trying to strongarm us. [whispering] That one. Yeah, call them back, tell them our terms. They need us more than we need them. You got this. Bye. So the fall collection is blowing up on Pinterest. Perfect. Let's blow up Insta, send a box to the Kardashians. One more thing. You're amazing. - [knocking] - All right, let me see it. I saw the Instagram post, and this is even more beautiful in person. I am so excited for you. So, these are for you. - Oh, you're so sweet. - Here's the thing. Two weeks paid leave for your honeymoon. I won't accept anything less. Thank you so much, Samantha. All right, Thomas, tell me how'd the game go last night? Twenty points, seven rebounds. Your girl is going to get a scholarship for sure. Here, you guys might like these more than we will. Court side? Suns/Bulls? Are you kidding me? Such a beautiful logo, even more beautiful than my logo. Just like you. Hi, Bryce. What a surprise. I missed you. Oh, that's sweet. Actually, I am glad that you're here. I have that meeting with the potential investors and I'd love to have you go over the terms. I was hoping you'd say that. Last thing I'd want is for anyone to take advantage of you. I can handle myself, but it is always good to have a lawyer in the room. Well, you're dating the right one. [phone ringing] Hey, Daddy. Yes, I'm still coming. He is, too. Yeah, we're really excited. You know, I would never miss the holidays with my family. Oh, I got to go, I have a meeting. Okay, we'll see you tomorrow... Okay, I'll tell him. Love you. Tell me what? He said he loves you. I... I love him, too. - I'm kidding. - Right, so am I. I'm just so excited to meet him. Now, I know we talked about making a potential investment in your company. But after we looked at the numbers, we realized.... You'll have to forgive his dramatic pause. He just likes drama. What he's trying to say is that we simply love Jovie May, and we're ready to make you a sizeable offer to acquire your company outright. Hmm. What kind of buyout offer are we talking about? Well, we didn't want to waste your time, so, this is what we were thinking. Hmm. Mhmm. Hmm. Wow, that is a lot of zeros next to each other. Samantha, we know that this is coming from left field, okay? But we want to assure you that we don't plan on changing anything. We are going to keep headquarters right here and we are going to keep your team exactly as it is. We love what you've built here. And we wish to honor that the best we can. Well... I'm speechless, which if you know me, that does not happen very often. I really need to think about this. Yeah, of course. Look, we're not trying to pressure you or anything, but we are looking at acquiring another business very similar to yours, if we can't get a deal for Jovie May. So, we're gonna need an answer by Thursday night. Thursday. Oh, that's Thanksgiving. Well, let's be honest, Thanksgiving ends after the meal now anyway, so people can get an early start on Black Friday. [all laughing] Thank you for this. I will think about it and get back to you. [gentle music] ♪ Now don't act too desperate, honey, we don't want to turn them off. Don't be ridiculous, she can't wait to see me. Hey! How's my little. Whoa... That's weird. There she is. How's my little girl? Oh! Mom. Samantha, oh, it's so good to see you. - This is Bryce. - Right. We met on the other side of the car. For some reason, he wasn't driving. - I was driving. - Well, you're the CEO. Oh, okay. Hi. - Aunt Samantha! - Nice to finally meet you. You guys! Oh, my goodness, you're so big! Oh! Who's the stranger? Is he gonna eat all the stuffing? Bro, do you know how many carbs are in stuffing? - I literally have no idea. - He's eight. Well, there's a lot, and I will not be touching it. Stranger danger! Oh, he's not a stranger. Oh, wow, Okay. Better safe than sorry. Kids these days, right? Sorry for my brothers' crass behavior. This is why we typically keep them locked up. I'll be fine. Thank you. So Bryce, Sam tells me you're on a strict meat-only diet. Keto diet. Yeah. I'm a little bit of a meat connoisseur myself. I mean, not exclusively meat, but I like to make sure, you know, I have it at every meal, balanced diet. Oh, which reminds me, the fire department has given me the okay to fry up a turkey again this year. Yeah, I still think it's a bad idea. You know, after what happened last time? Okay, we can give that a little bit of a rest, Linda. That was three years ago, which reminds me, time to start the brine. Hey, little sis, what's cracking? "What's cracking?" Really? No good? I was trying something new. Annie, how's it putting up with this guy? Oh, you know. No. We don't know. Enlighten us. So, this must be Bryce? Well, technically it's Bryce Jones, Esquire, you know, because I'm a lawyer, but you don't have to call me that. Don't worry, I won't. Um, don't be dissing on my sister, okay? They still say dissing, right? I don't think so. Well, it feels right. Oh, well, I'm so sorry for my husband's behavior. He's just a big, dumb teddy bear. So, Samantha, you'll be in your old room. Bryce, you'll be staying in the guest room with Luke. Cute. Luke? Sam. Hey. Luke Hudson? Oh, I'm your biggest fan. Babe, you never told me you know Luke Hudson. This is incredible. - Wow. - What are you doing here? Luke has a couple of shows in town this week and he's going to be all alone for the holidays. So, Annie and I decided we should invite him to join us. Oh, babe. Please tell me we're going to that show. Please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please. Oh, please. I guess we're going to the show. Yeah! All right! Hey, Luke, you should do some of your new material for us. - Oh, I don't think so. No. - Come on. No, it'll help you, you know, get ready for the show. Come on. I think we should just leave him alone. Come on. Do it. Just say something funny. Do something about lawyers. Yeah, I'd like to hear some of your material. Come on. Luke, Luke, Luke, Luke, Luke, Luke, Luke, Luke, Luke, Luke, Luke, Luke! All right! I'll do one joke. One joke. Normally, I prefer my crowd has a few drinks in them... [laughing loudly] That... That wasn't the bit yet. Genius. - All right, uh... - Oh, Luke. Luke Hudson. Thanks. But, you guys have been an amazing crowd. I'll be here all weekend. Tip the wait staff. [applause] [doorbell ringing] Oh, pizza's here. Pizza! Pizza time! And this is where we get to bunk up together. Who'd have thought I'd be hanging out with Luke Hudson all weekend? This is going to be hilarious. Yeah, they didn't tell me you were coming either. Wait, hold up. Hold up. Here we go. - [camera clicking] - Yeah. Oh, my boys are going to be so jealous. #Besties! It's Bryce, right? Yeah. Okay. Word on the street is you're a lawyer? Yeah. Bryce Jones, Esquire. Lawyer. That's right. That's right. Look, can I ask you a legal question? It's off the books, just, like, between colleagues. - Sure. - So, okay. Say I have this friend who's dating this girl I don't like, and I somehow figure out how to break them up. Could that girl then sue me? Well, I guess she could sue you for punitive damages. Right, punitive. Of course. But that isn't very likely, is it? Well, depends on the person, is this someone you know? No, no. It's just... it's hypothetical. You know, I just, um... like talking legal... punitive damages and such. But you wouldn't sue someone if it happened to you, right? Oh, probably not. Great. That's it. Oh, that was easy. Great talk. See you, Luke. [Charlie in distance] Annie, good news! [yelling] - What? - Help me. How long have you been in there? You've got to help me. I'm being poisoned. Look at this. There's no gluten in it. You might as well cook me horse manure with chocolate chips all over it. That's not a bad idea. Either one of you kids have some chocolate chips? Hello, sir, I'm Bryce Jones, Esquire. I'm not interested in your handshake unless you're about to slip me some Twinkies. Got any Twinkies on you? Uh... Should have brought Twinkies. Don't you realize that the guest is supposed to bring the head of the household a baked good when he comes in? If you'd made this misstep in olden days, it would have cost you both your arms! Well, I guess I'll just come out and ask already! How serious is it with Bryce? Thanks for not beating around the bush. Well, you know, no time for small talk. Been married for 13 years. I need gossip, girlfriend. Well, I brought him home for Thanksgiving, so it's kind of serious. I mean, we're focused on our careers, so we don't talk about the future that much. But... We fit together, if that makes sense. Totally. But, like, is it going to be a little bit weird with Luke here? Yeah. Thanks for the heads up on that, by the way. I just thought, you know, like, the surprise of my brother being here would just, you know, add a little spice to the holidays. - [scoffing] - Tell me, how did you immediately feel when you saw Luke? I don't like where this is going. Better just to face it head on. Fine. It was shock, and then dread, and then just a little pinch of excitement. Yes, I knew it. - I knew it. - Settle down. We broke up. It's over. I mean, if it was over, why did he agree to spend the whole week with your family, knowing that you were going to be here? He's a stand-up comedian. This is a great place to gather material. Right. It doesn't matter anyway. I'm perfectly happy with Bryce. Perfectly happy. I mean, it's not necessarily how I would describe my soulmate, but... You know what I mean? Totally. Listen up. We're all in this together. You, me and the new stiff here. Without pumpkin pie, there's... there's no use to living. Well, I mean, I don't eat any gluten either, so. - By choice? - Sure. What's the matter with you? Seriously? Now, I want you to put your young heads together and figure out some way to get me pumpkin pie. - [Linda] Dad? - Ah! That conversation never happened. Have you guys seen my dad? [whispering] No, no. Okay. Well, it's time for pizza, and we're going to be headed to the soup kitchen soon. That's... should... [soft piano music] Babe, my selfie with Luke already has 200 likes on Instagram. I can't believe you never mentioned him before. Well, I don't usually mention past relationships with my boyfriend. - You dated him? - Yeah. Why would you break up with Luke Hudson? - [chuckling] - Good question. 207. So do we have to, like, serve food to the homeless people the whole time? We get to. We do it every year. There's not gonna be any crazy people, are there? I mean, I'm still scared from when I had to visit my uncle in the insane asylum. You mean the psychiatric ward? Is there a difference? Yeah, but don't worry, it's completely safe. Don't know about you guys, but I am crushing this hairnet. Very classy. - Hey, Marie! This is Bryce. - He's a soul-sucking lawyer. - [laughing] - Okay, what? This guy. Marie actually runs this whole place. A lawyer? This is perfect. I know you're probably really looking forward to serving the homeless, but would you mind looking at a couple of documents that are... Yes, yep. Uh huh. I'd love to. Let's do that. Okay, great. Thank you! You're okay if I go, right? Go. He's totally going to bill her, isn't he? No, he would not do that. I don't know. He seemed a little too happy to help. ♪ There you go, sir. There you go. You know, I'd forgotten how awesome this is. Yeah. Mhmm. So what's the deal with Bryce Jones, Esquire? - Be nice. - At least I didn't make a lawyer joke, which if I did, he would have laughed harder than anybody. I did not know he was such a big fan. Seriously. You know, I might have to get a restraining order against your new boyfriend. I mean, it throws me off my game when someone laughs that hard at my jokes. I know I'm funny. Nobody is that funny. I think he's just nervous about meeting you. If he comes to my show tomorrow night, just... have him tone it down. Okay. But I can still heckle you, right? Oh, of course. - There you go, ma'am. - Soup? So, your mother tells me that Jovie May is, as she puts it, "reaching a new stratosphere." So, you've been asking my mom about me? No, I keep saying, please stop telling me about your daughter, but you know that woman is. It's actually going really great. In fact, someone just offered to buy my company. Are you serious? Sam, that's amazing. I'm so proud of you. You followed your dreams and you did it. You know, I love watching star-crossed lovers as much as the next homeless guy, but... can you please get me my soup? I'm so sorry, and we are not star-crossed lovers. I'm pretty sure he's gone. You're good. So, are you going to sell? What? Your business? Oh... I don't know. It is a really good offer, though. Well, you could always sell it and start a new one. Well, legally, I have to wait three years to start another fashion brand. Hmm, that is tough. You know, I have tough decisions to make all the time too. People are always like, "Oh, you're so funny, you're so hilarious." I don't even know what to say back. - Real people problems. - Yes! Like the other day, I was in the airport and this woman was like, "Luke, Luke, Luke Hudson." Finally, I'm like, "Grandma. Keep up. Pack lighter." Luke Hudson. I know you! See? A fan of my comedy. Comedy? I used to wipe your backside every day. Oh, really? I was his babysitter. That is, until he became unbearable and I had to quit. Ma'am, I know exactly how you feel. Wait, Mrs. Appletree? Wow. That's a... That's a blast from the past. Hey, what do you think she's doing here? You don't think she's actually homeless, do you? Why don't you go talk to her? I don't know, it might be embarrassing for her. Soup, please. Oh, there you go, sir... Grandpa Joe, where did you get that outfit? I beg your pardon, ma'am? I think you got me confused with someone else. I'm as homeless as the proverbial boll weevil. And I understand your food is packed with gluten. Grandpa, you're supposed to be over here helping serve the food, not eating it. Can you believe this brazen lady? She keeps referring to me as "Grandpa." Which of you people are handing out the pumpkin pie? Don't think we have any of that. [whispering] Two doors down. [soft music] I didn't get to hand out rolls this year. Next year. [indiscernible chatting] ♪ ♪ Oh, man, she needed so much legal help, I finally told her to stop by my office so we could button up all the deets. That's so nice, I'm glad you could help her. Oh, you should have seen me. I was lawyering my butt off. Double bonus, I didn't run the risk of ruining this $200 shirt. I mean, seriously, you have food all over you. Yeah. Did get kind of crazy in there. I could totally bill her for the last two hours. Wait, you're not serious, are you? No, obviously, I'm joking. I wouldn't charge her for that. I'm not always a soul-sucking lawyer, as my best friend, Luke Hudson, puts it. Plus, she got me out of serving food to the homeless people. So. Speaking of Luke, you two were spending a lot of time together. I actually feel a little jealous. Luke Hudson. Wait a minute, are you... are you jealous of him or me? Him. Him. Okay, let me rephrase that. Did you want to hang out with me or him? Oh, look who's the jealous one now? Wait, who were you jealous of? [phone ringing] Who's that? The buyers. They're really putting the pressure on. That's great. That means we can negotiate a higher purchase price. We are going to bleed them dry. You are so lucky to have me in your corner. I just don't know if I want to sell my business. I love it. Look, one thing I've learned over the years is not to get emotionally attached in business. If someone makes you a good offer, you always take it. Yeah, that's probably the smart thing to do. Of course it is. All right? You never know what the future could hold. You should just let me negotiate on your behalf. I have no emotional ties to your business. I can be ruthless. But you have emotional ties to me. Sure, you're the best. So, you have emotional ties to my business. Of course, I was just trying not to be braggadocios. What I mean to say is with my negotiating skills, I will ensure you get the most money possible. Not that you couldn't do a good job yourself, it's just, this is my world. This is where I thrive. Did that sounds super cool? Yeah. Real cool. ♪ I'm really torn. I mean, so much of my life has been Jovie May, and... it's my identity. Oh, I don't know about that. Your business is what you do, honey, it's not who you are. You're wise, Mom. Don't act so surprised. I don't only make the best chocolate chip cookies in America. I'm good for other things too. - [Grandpa Joe] I knew it! - Ah! Dad, you have to stop doing that. You almost gave me a heart attack. You're trying to save the best for yourself, huh? Well, you forget that my middle name is Resilient. Dang it, Dad. Now I have to find a new hiding spot. Good luck with that! Toss me one of those America's best cookies, and I will share with you my ideas for saving 50 bucks on your yearly electric bill. Well, as tempting as that is, you know what the doctor said. Ah, and what does that kid know? All he wants to do is get his $40 co-pay and ruin my life. Grandpa, if it was up to me, I would totally - give you a cookie. - Sam! I mean, there's no use in him despising both of us. I always said you're my favorite granddaughter. Right. Time for bed, Dad. Oh, and it's a dead end around here, so I might as well. Grandpa, do you need some help? I'm old school, sweetie. You save all that for your gluten-free yuppie friend. I bet he lets you drive him around town, too, doesn't he? [laughing] Oh. I forgot to tell you, I broke one of your good China dishes, Peaches. Dad, I told you not to climb up here! [quirky jazz music] Did you give him the... Dad! Did I just see your grandpa shoving an entire plate of cookies down the front of his pants? Probably. Well, that's as authentic as it gets. For the Banks family. What's a guy gotta do to get one of those? Where's that one guy who followed you here? That guy is a morning person, so he's in bed. Lulu's. Reminds me of our first date. You mean the time that you asked for my phone number at Charlie and Annie's wedding, but did not call me for three years? That time? Yeah, that's the one. What took you so long? Well, if you think about it, we were basically related at that point. Gross. Stop that. Lulu's did have amazing pie, though. I wouldn't know because you always ate mine. Well, you know what they say. If there's pumpkin pie on the table, you should eat it all. I think Grandpa Joe's the only person who would say that. Exactly, and that man is a dessert genius. And, uh... I also think you should take your time if that person might be forever. I'm going to take a drink of this and kill the awkward silence. Good idea. Mm. So good. I'm going to go to bed. We never should have broken up. - What? - It was stupid of me. I thought I was doing the chivalrous thing by letting you follow your dreams. But the truth is I was scared. Our paths were diverging. I panicked. We should have just made it work. Why are you telling me this? Because I need you to know. Luke, you really hurt me. I had to move on. I'm with that guy now. I know, I just... I figured if we're gonna spend the whole week together, we should take that elephant in the room for a ride, you know? Look, I'm really proud of you, Sam. I'm proud of who you are, I'm proud of who you've become, and I'm happy for you. I'm even happy for that guy... even if I still have feelings for... Feelings for who? Where did you get a cookie? Grandpa Joe said I could have it as long as I kept quiet. It's got a ton of gluten. I know, but I really want Grandpa Joe to like me, so I took it. Oh, I will have one of those. This is hot chocolate. I will have a water then. - Okay. - Okay. [sighing] So what were you guys talking about? Who has feelings for who? No, I was just doing a new bit I'm working on. It's about the ex-girlfriend and how the rebound guy never ends up working out. [laughing and coughing] Are you okay? You okay there, Esquire? [Bryce] Yeah! Oh, that is so true. So true. Well, I think I'll go take one more shower and get out of here before my comedy actually kills someone. Don't stay up too late, you two. Right. Oh, man... Genius! I mean... ♪ ♪ - Going somewhere? - Oh! My gosh! You scared me. Sorry. What are you doing up so early? Well, it's a beautiful morning. I thought I'd get up a little early and do some last minute prep for my big set tonight. My family's really excited to see you perform. Well, not that I needed the added pressure, but my manager called, he said two producers might be in the crowd. Apparently, they've been having some talks about Luke Hudson. That's amazing. If anyone deserves it, it's you. You've worked really hard and sacrificed a lot. Yeah, I have sacrificed. Well, I'm just about done here, if you'd like some company. - You ready? - Yep. Oh, hey, Luke. Did you want to come with us? I'd rather get waterboarded. Not a runner, huh? Something like that. Hey, Bryce, are you sure you want the neighbors to see you in such casual attire? I know, I forgot my nice jogging polo. Well, we should get going. What a beautiful morning, right? Thank you very much. [whispering] Jogging polo. [upbeat jazzy music] This is so exciting. I've never been to a live comedy act before. Hey, did somebody bring tomatoes? Tomatoes are disgusting. I never want any. - Yeah, we know, Dad. - It's okay. You know what? I could just stick to heckling. Dad, please don't say anything during the show. Relax, honey, your father's only joking. - You are joking. - Joking. I could do some standup. I mean, how hard can it be? Yeah, he was doing a bit in the car. He's a sweet kid. - You guys wanna hear it? - Yeah. - Oh, please, no. - I'd love to hear it, son. - Oh, boy. - Okay. Okay. All right. So you know how dentists, dentists are always, like, putting... they're shoving their hands down your mouth. Shoot. Hold on. I know. You know how you're always... They're always asking questions, and you can't answer them because... Shoot, no, come on. How did I get this? I had it in the car, you remember? I haven't been to the dentist in 47 years. Give me a few minutes. I got this. No, it was good in the car. It was great. - You were laughing. - It was. Luke Hudson! [cheering] [loud applause] All right, we're here for the holidays, last show before Thanksgiving. Thanksgiving, am I right? [Bryce] Yeah, Thanksgiving! That guy knows what I'm talking about. So who still has to buy a turkey tomorrow? Couple late shoppers and you're not panicked? Not panicked at all? Oh, I'd be freaking out. But you know, when I really freak out, the one time in my daily life, when I freak out, when I use the restroom and I can't find my phone. [laughter] That's panic... some of you know what I'm talking, that is panic, right? Because what do you do? What do... Am I gonna just sit in there, like this is the 1800s? [laughing] Yes! He could always make you laugh. I know what you're doing. [upbeat music] Stop it, I don't trust you, lady. That's why I never became a rocket scientist. ♪ We weren't both born yesterday. Am I right? [laughter] ♪ Comedy gold, dude! Comedy gold. All right, goodbye everybody! [cheering] Love you guys, bye bye. Knock, knock. Luke Hudson, ladies and gentlemen. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Keep going. Keep going, louder. Louder. Great show. You even made Grandpa Joe laugh. You tell anybody that, I'll strangle you in your sleep. I already don't even know what he just said. Yes, you don't. In all seriousness, well done. We could really tell you were in your element. Are you kidding me? I mean, that was one of the greatest sets of all time. I mean... I laughed for 45 straight minutes. And I heard you. - [knocking] - Hey Luke, Got some fans out here that really want to meet you. Tell them I'll be right out. Well, I just want to say thank you all for your support. It means an awful lot. Everybody, except for Grandpa Joe, of course. - Dang right. - Now, if you'll excuse me, I'd better go meet my raving fan. So I bid you all a farewell. Well done. Great job. Thank you. So good. Hey, Bryce, remember when Sam drives you home, have her keep it under the speed limit. - Gas mileage. - Okay, Lucas. Okay. [gentle music] Are you going the speed limit? Yes, for the eighth time. Man, what a great show. What was he saying about rocket scientists? Something about IKEA. Hilarious. We should go to IKEA. What's the matter? Not your style of humor? Huh? Oh no, it was great. I just got another text from the investors during the show. They just met with another fashion brand. You know, if you're having second thoughts, you should just try to negotiate a higher buyout. I mean, at some point, the buyout's high enough that you're crazy not to take the money. It's not always about the money. Haven't you ever seen You've Got Mail? It's not personal, it's business. It's always about the money. Not for me. So, you're saying if they offered you 50 million for Jovie May, you'd say no? Of course not. It's always about the money. Hmm. IKEA! Where does he come up with this stuff? [sighs] [gentle music] So do you really feel comfortable, Bryce and Luke together, unsupervised? Yeah, they're with the guys. I see your point. Hopefully, the cars distract him until he has to leave. He's leaving? Yeah, he has an emergency meeting with a client. Just like that? It's for the best. He's too... stuffy for you. - Peyton! - Someone had to say it. I'm sorry. Look, Peyton and I are gonna have a long talk about tact later. Undoubtedly, she gets it from her dad. It's okay. You know, he is a little stuffy. Lawyers. What are you going to do? So, when is he coming back? It's kind of hard to tell with those types of things. Well, not everybody is going to be disappointed. Oh, wow. I actually think she gets her tact from her mom. This is different. I'm just stating the facts. So, Aunt Samantha, are you really going to sell Jovie May? Please say no. How am I going to become your VP of Growth if you sell? Well, I don't know yet. It's been really hard and I've been so distracted. I haven't even been able to consider the pros and cons. Well, what does your heart tell you? She just told you, her heart is distracted. You are ruthless. Well, I have been married to your brother for 13 years. Good point. I mean, my gut's telling me I shouldn't take the deal. I'm really good at my job. On the other hand, I mean, is this what I want to do for the rest of my life? That type of money, I could do anything. If it really is that difficult of a choice for you, then... you'll probably be all right either way. If you do sell, you can make it up to me by buying a car for my 16th birthday. Preferably a classic hot rod. [upbeat music] [engines revving] Now, look at this car. Gorgeous. Gorgeous? Gorgeous doesn't do it justice. I remember the first time I saw it. It was beyond love at first sight. The curves, the highlights, polished imported V8, dual exhaust, four-speed Muncie, Positraction rear end. Just the two of us, out there on the strip, waiting for our next victim. Okay, easy, Dad. You're a married man. Your mom's okay with it. I've got to tell you, John, that was moving. You know, I used to drive this model, back when I was a teenager. Ladies couldn't get enough of it. This is a '69, dad. You were 30 in 1969. You missed the point. Point, which I was about to make, is how much the ladies loved me when I was so rudely interrupted by the guy that married my daughter. Boys, go get yourselves a soda. I'm not sure where Grandpa Joe is going with this. Hey, bring me some cake. No, boys, don't. So, Bryce, what do you think? Eh, muscle cars aren't really my thing. Not really into the high carbon output if I can help it. Do they have any electric cars? - What did he just say? - We can't know. You know, Bryce, surprisingly not a whole lot of crossover between fans of muscle cars and proponents of the environment. So why don't we head over here and see if we can't find some for ourselves? Why'd they cut a hole in the hood there? Yeah, well, usually when the car is hot, they'll slam the hood super hard and then then it pops through. I thought the courtroom was a tough crowd. Thanks for getting me out of there. Ah, don't worry about it. I'm sure they'll warm up to you, eventually. - You think? - Sure. Well, they sure seem to love you. Oh, that's because I'm an incredible person. So what's up with Sam's business? Any updates? No. Classic indecision. You know, if it was up to me, it'd be sold already. - If only. - Yeah. You know, I do have power of attorney, I could actually sell it for her. As much as I would love to see you do that, probably not the best idea. You would? - I read you. - What? Look, I know you and Samantha have a history together, so I'm sure this can't be easy for you. Oh, nonsense, that's so... you know. How long you guys been together anyway? About a year. - That long, huh? - Yeah. Has she brought up the M-word? Why would she talk to me about murder? Why would your mind go right to murder? When you're an attorney, the M-word is murder. Okay, yeah. I was talking about marriage. Oh, marriage. Yeah. Well, I've definitely thought about it. But she hasn't brought it up yet. - Fantastic. - Huh? That hot rod is fantastic. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Wow. So, first holiday with the family? Yeah, well, technically, I have to go back for a meeting this afternoon, so, I'm not sure if I'll be back in time for dinner tomorrow. - That's perfect! - Huh? That paint job for that year, make, and model. That's perfect. Okay, cool. Well, that's too bad you gotta go, but... you know, gotta have your meetings. Especially this meeting. You know, if things go the way I think they will, we'll be talking a lot more about the M-word. The M-word is marriage, this time, not murder. - Yeah, I figured that. - Yeah. Ooh, now we're talking. - [whistling] - That is a beaut. Bryce, isn't this your car? Yeah, I didn't know where to park, so I just came by here. Yeah, that's... Do you want me to pop the hood? - Let's just leave that down. - Okay. Look, I, for one, am gonna be incredibly sad to see you go. Ah, you'll be fine without me. Just tell them one of your jokes. Keen advice, Esquire. My specialty. And I won't even charge you for it. Oh, my lucky day. [Samantha] $300 for a Christmas tree? That's what I said. Oh, you say that no matter what something costs, our home will look classy. Be quite the presentation. Not $300 classy. Oh, Daddy, you know this is a useless pursuit. I know. But if I don't protest, then the next thing you know, it's 500. Did someone summon me to the kitchen table? Oh yes, we need you to write down something that you're thankful for. Okay. And this can be anything I want? Yeah. Just a warning, it will be read out loud to the whole entire family. Yeah. Let me get another one of those, please. Thank you. Oh, what are you guys doing over here? Hold on... A little puzzle action. Watch this. This one will be a perfect fit there. This one, you're gonna want it there. Corners almost done. Son, we've been working on this puzzle for over 15 minutes and we haven't gotten a single piece to fit. I'm sorry. No, don't be silly. We're just... we're wondering how you're doing it. Well, when I was a kid, my dad used to make me solve a giant puzzle that was literally a black square before I could go play with my friends, so. - You're lying. - Scout's honor. Hey, fellow scout here. Nice. Yeah. Charlie quit after Cub Scouts. - [sighing] - You gotta let that go, Dad. Well, full disclosure, I only made it to Tenderfoot. Whoa, Tenderfoot. That's impressive, huh? That would have been something. I am so sorry I'm not the perfect son that loves sleeping in the freezing cold, and not in this nice, warm bed, Dad. Is that what you want to hear? That'd be nice. Yes. Actually, for your information, I went down to Troop 482 and I tried getting back in, but they said, one, I was way too old and two, it wouldn't be appropriate. It's what a Tenderfoot would do. I forgive you. I love you, Dad. Hey, how about you helping us out with this puzzle? Sure, let's do it. No, Luke, you need to come help us. Yeah, this one is way harder. Well, you know what? I'll sit in the middle. I'll help everybody. How's that? [phone ringing] Scott. Yeah. Oh, that is fantastic, thank you for doing that. Will do, bye. Was that Scott, your manager? Yeah, he just hired Mrs. Appletree to be his new secretary. Mrs. Appletree from the soup kitchen? Yeah, isn't that cool? Look at you, changing people's lives. Well, I'm just happy I could be in a position to help. Oh, that reminds me. Any word from the television producers? [Luke] Actually, those were the "fans" that wanted to meet after the show, and they want to have another meeting about a possible one hour comedy special on one of the big streaming networks, which will probably turn out to be nothing. [Samantha] Are you kidding me? First of all thanks for withholding this exciting news! And second, they'd be... crazy not to sign you to a deal right now. [John] I agree with Sam. You got real talent. I mean, you could be on the Jimmy... the show. - [Linda] The what? - The Jimmy, you know? - I forget his last name. - Jimmy Kimmel. - No. No. The funny one. - Uh, Jimmy... Conan. [John] No, no, Jimmy. Lip sync... - Jimmy Fallon. - Fallon. That's it. You could be on the Jimmy Fallon. You'd be great on Fallon. Well, thank you, that means a lot. Looks like you both are at a crossroads in your lives. Just like last time. I'm going to go get the Christmas decorations out. Hey, we just finished the puzzles. - You really missed out. - Both of them? That was supposed to last all weekend. My bad. Want some help? That depends. Did your dad blindfold you and make you decorate the whole house and you're gonna finish all this in five minutes? Don't be ridiculous. It's going to take me at least 10. It's a big house. [Luke] Thank you. This is my favorite tradition. Checking the Christmas lights for broken bulbs? No. Decorating for Christmas Thanksgiving weekend. Ah yes, much less weird. How about you? [Luke] Uh, actually, this one is kind of weird. But after Annie got married, every year, my mom and I would watch Groundhog Day to kick off the Christmas season. Oh yeah, I remember you saying that. Your mom was the best. Yeah, she was. Luke, I'm sorry, I wasn't there for you when she passed. Sam, you do not have to apologize. It was not your obligation. We'd broken up. Yeah, but I should have been there. You know, you're right, you are the worst ex-girlfriend ever. Remind me, why Groundhog Day again? Uh, it's a classic, arguably one of the top five greatest comedy films of all time. But it has nothing to do with Christmas. It's a whole different holiday. I told you it was weird. I mean, it is snowing. I guess that's Christmassy. Yeah, thanks for softening the blow. Who are you gonna watch it with this year? Annie? It's not really her thing. Plus, I've kind of given it up. But it's a tradition. You've got to carry on your mom's memory. It's kind of hard to explain. Okay, I get it. So how's your big decision coming along? - Any progress? - Ugh, no. It's like my mind is rejecting the notion of even thinking about it. Okay, well, maybe I can help. So what is the one major argument that makes you want to sell your business? I guess it's the unknown of ever getting an offer like this again. And if I sell it at this price, it really validates me as a successful businesswoman. Yeah, but who do you need validation from? You're killing it with your business. Anybody who pays attention can see that. [Samantha] But I guess there's always this built-in insecurity of being a young female entrepreneur. Okay, yeah, we'll address that in a minute. All right. What is it you love most about your business? I've built this amazing team. And creating content and even getting to see our customers put on the pieces and then their whole countenance changes. [sighs] Sam, you should see your face right now. When you talk about your business, you're glowing. There's no question what you need to do, turn down the offer. You love your business. And don't ever compare yourself to any other entrepreneur, male or female. You're amazing. You've always been amazing. I've always known you were gonna be a success. And... That's why I had to get out of your way. Anyways... it's too bad that Bryce, Esquire, had to up and leave so suddenly. Yeah, I'm sure you're really torn up about it. I am. Who else is gonna laugh at all my jokes? I will. Once they're funny. Wow. Okay, everybody's a comedian now. Oh, I'm so sorry. What am I doing, we can't do this. [Annie] Ah, come on! So close! Sam, I'm sorry. That wasn't fair to you or your lawyer friend. I'm going to bed. [sighs] Capital job, Hudson. [melodic classical instrumental] Hey sis, can I join you? [Samantha] Of course. So uh, almost kissed Luke, huh? Wow. That news travelled fast. Thank you. I was hoping this week I'd have some clarity but I'm more confused than ever. Hmm. Back in elementary school, I remember my best friend, Brian Vorkapich, asking me which one I loved more: Thundercats or G.I. Joes. Obviously, it was like, "How dare you ask me to choose one over the other? That's blasphemy." Yeah. What kind of friend is that? Right? But he would not stop bugging me about it. So for weeks, I toiled, trying to decide which one I loved more. - Weeks? - [Charlie] I know, I know, it wasn't enough time, but... I was under a lot of pressure. So I took my Thundercat toys. Hid them away for a few days. And then I did the same thing with my G.I. Joe toys. You know, to see which one I would miss more. And? [Charlie] Well, that was around the same time Dad bought us a Nintendo, so... I totally forgot where I hid them. Well, the point is you have to ask yourself, "Would you rather be stuck with Lady Jaye for the rest of your life? Or Cheetara?" I don't know who either of those people are. Well, neither is a bad choice, but... if I had to go with one, I'd say... Cheetara. That's what I love about you, Charlie. You really know how to simplify things. You're welcome. [laughing raucously] Oh, Luke Hudson. I know him! - Hey, Dad. - [loud clattering] What'cha doing? Don't scare me like that. I know the feeling. [John] Hey, couldn't sleep? Today's the big day. Yeah, that's right. My fried turkey. Everybody's pretty excited. Yes, that is exciting. But I meant today is the day I have to give the investors my answer. I mean, am I going to sell Jovie May? Right. Right. Oh, you're asking me? Uh, yeah, well, I'm not... I'm not too sure you told me what you were gonna do. Maybe... you know what? You probably did tell me and then I don't... I don't recall. Whoo. Okay, this is a little more pressure than - I was hoping for this early. - Easy, Dad. - Okay. - I was just thinking out loud. Okay. So, do you know what you're gonna do? I mean, I know I love my business. Every day I go there and I feel like, "This is what I should be doing with my life." Wow. It seems like you really love it, but you're also torn. So what's pulling at you from the other side of the table? The last few days I've really seen how much I've had to sacrifice to get to where I am. I have regrets. Let me give you a piece of advice, sweetie. By selling your company, it's not gonna change anything from the past. You're still going to have those regrets. But if you really love something that much? Hold on to it... fiercely. You're a wise man, Dad. Thanks. Maybe somebody should tell your mother, that the way wouldn't have to sneak around a dawn, just to fry me up a turkey. - I love you, Dad. - I love you too, Sam. All right, ready? Annie, babe, I love you but you're going down. No, you're going down, old timer. - All right, let's do this... - Thank you. Hut. - Come on! - [yelling] [Annie] Go, go, go, go! - [cheering] - Yeah! That's what's up... Oh! Why? Pretty sure I was in the end zone. My bad. Come on, everybody, get in. All right, listen up. 'Kay. Michael's gonna be our secret weapon this time. I'm gonna give him the ball. Everybody else, block. All right, on three. Mac and cheesie. One, two, three. Mac and cheesie! We got this, little bro. [John] Ready. Hike. [Annie] No. - [grunts] - Yeah. Ah! Ah! 'Kay, I deserve that. - [John] Oh! - Yeah! Don't you think you're being a little hard on him, Sam? He's a big boy. He can handle it. Look, I saw you go in for that kiss just as much as he did. That's not even why I'm mad at him. Well, why are you mad at him? Because he made me want to. ♪ ♪ [cheering] [Linda] Yeah, Dad, that's right! [Annie] We could've done better on that tie, though. Hey, good game. I mean, we were all playing touch and you were tackling and it was a little scary to see how much pleasure you got out of hurting a full-sized man. But other than that, good game. Well, you're lucky I went easy on you. So are you done being mad at me or you wanna get a few more shots in? I think you've had enough. - [John] Luke! - Charlie! I need you for the, you know the thing. The thing? I... I don't know the... Go do the thing. - [Luke] What's the thing? - [John whispers] The thing. - [Luke] Oh! - Look, I don't care what the professionals say, as long as we are out here, away from the garage, I think everything is safe. The one good thing about getting older... Okay, here we are! What's with all the sneaking around? I mean, I'm guessing Mom doesn't know about this. Let's not change the subject, son. Okay? Let's check the oil temperature. [Luke] John, I don't want to question your methods but aren't we a little too close to that bush? [John] Don't be ridiculous. As long as you don't overfill the pot, nothing to worry about. Still a little ways away. So Luke, my wife tells me that she walked in on something interesting last night. [Luke] Grandpa Joe shoving dessert items down his pants? That's not newsworthy anymore. No, no, no, no. I'm talking about you and Samantha in the living room. Wasn't any funny business going on, was there? I don't know what he's talking about. We're just taking out Christmas decorations. No, no, according to Annie, you guys were getting pretty close. What... what about the other guy? Yeah, Luke. What about the other guy? Exactly. Which is why there's nothing to talk about. Okay, we're ready for the turkey. Oh, yeah. Thank you. Very exciting. [small explosion] [flames roaring] [extinguisher whooshing] - Tenderfoot, my a... - [John] All right! Not a word about this to your mother. All right? We are all in this together now. I'm already in a secret society with Grandpa Joe and I try not to be in more than one per family. I don't think he would let me out of his. Good luck, guys. [Charlie] You get an A for effort, Dad. Thanks. Okay, who likes it well done? Hey, where are the guys? Oh, well, John is secretly frying a turkey, which I'm sure will catch on fire. Which is why I'm baking another one right now. Oh, so Sam, is your boyfriend gonna be back in time for Thanksgiving dinner? Oh, you mean lawyer boyfriend. [Linda] Why are you saying lawyer boyfriend? Well, I just think we should differentiate between lawyer boyfriend and, you know, any other boyfriend that she might have. There's only one boyfriend and he'll be here shortly. Hmm. Yeah, you could have fooled me. I know what I saw. First of all, I'm disturbed by your lack of shame in your creepy gawking. Second of all, it's not what it looked like. What what looked like? Nothing. Nothing. [Annie] Well, I passed the family room when I saw Samantha and Luke getting pretty chummy. - Really? - No, not really. Nothing happened. He was just helping me get the decorations out. [Annie] Yeah, okay. If there's decorations that make you... Embrace and your lips practically touching... Mistletoe. Okay, besides mistletoe. - Nothing happened. - Did he kiss you? - [gasps] - [sighs] Well, it looks like Thanksgiving dinner just got way more interesting. You two need to stop it. A love triangle, at Thanksgiving! Yes. That should be the title of your movie. What movie? What are you guys talking about? All the drama and romance at the holidays. It would make a pretty good movie. You're pathetic. Don't pretend like you wouldn't watch it. [stutters] That's not the point. Grandma, what made you fall in love with grandpa? Ah. He's a big goofball and a hopeless romantic. That's what I love about him. How about you, Mom? Hm. I love how fiercely loyal your father is. You know, I would just never question his love and devotion to me. [Peyton] How about you, Aunt Samantha? What first made you fall in love? I guess that he could always make me laugh. And I felt like every day I was hanging out with my best friend. Well, I guess that's what you get when you date the stand up comedian. Bryce is a stand up comedian, too? No, that's not what I meant. What I love about Bryce... Sorry. You answered the question. Your turn is over. Someone asked you about love and you only thought of Luke. - No take backs! - All right. I think we've tortured Sam enough for one day. - Let's give it a rest. - It's all right, Mom. You know what I love about Bryce? I don't have to worry about him breaking my heart. ♪ [announcer] Great first two plays by Detroit. [Grandpa Joe] That number 11, he's something else, isn't he? Hey, you're not wrong. He's got all day to throw with that offensive line? I wonder if the Lion's players hate or love that they have to play every Thanksgiving. Probably more concerned with the fact they have to play for the Lions. When's the last time they made the playoffs? I have no idea. Probably not since Barry Sanders, right? So, the 1900's? You know, if Whizzer White was playing, it'd be a different story. You know, he was a four sport athlete in high school. Yeah, we know, Dad. You tell us every year. Yeah, he could run circles around that defense, I tell ya. Nobody could do it like Whizzer White. - [doorbell ringing] - I got it. Yeah, but if he's holding the jersey, - then that's pass interference. - Hello, Mr. Banks. [John] Yeah, sure. Come on in. - Yeah, look at that tie. - [Bryce] Thanks. All right. So it's third down, right? [Grandpa Joe] Here we go. Yeah. [Luke] Feel something good, here. [announcer] Yes. Yes. Yes, yes. - Oh! - Woo! Is this my Cowboys? Oh, great. You're back already. - No, this is the Lions. - Oh, you guys are Lions fans? - [chuckles] - I pity you. No. I don't get it. The Lions just scored. But you guys aren't Lions fans. Exactly. Then why are you cheering for the Lions? Why is he asking so many questions? Okay, I think they're watching the parade, there in the kitchen. Did you bring me my Twinkies? Uh... Look, we're cheering for the Lions because it's Thanksgiving. You cheer for the Lions. But what if you don't like the Lions? You're missing the point? I mean, it's Thanksgiving. You cheer for the Lions. It's just... It's just what you do. Oh, okay. Okay, I got it. I got it. Okay, yeah, I get it. It's just that they lose every year, though. - He still doesn't get it. - Not a lick. Not a lick. Sam, your friend is here. If Whizzer White was playing here, we'd be winning that turkey leg. [Luke, John and Charlie] We know... Whizzer White. I know that name. He's infamous for one of the worst plays in NFL history, right? What did you say? Yeah. Didn't he, like, run back 50 yards to get away from the defense and then fumble the ball into the other team's end zone? - [chuckling] - [Grandpa Joe] That's it! [Charlie] Oh, come on, man. What are you doing? I gave you all the signs. So much for watching the game. Please don't hurt me, sir. You know, sometimes you've got to give an ignorant, young kid a history lesson. Whizzer White was a magician on the football field, he could do things that would make the... hair on your back tingle. Did you say something bad about Whizzer White? - [grunts] - That's a big no, no. He's my grandpa's childhood hero. How was I supposed to know? Did anything exciting happen while I was gone? Oh, the Lions are up. - Nice. - You too? I mean, you got to cheer for the Lions. - It's Thanksgiving. - Apparently. Okay. Good luck with the Whizzer trivia. He's probably gonna test ya. And he was forced to go backwards 40 yards. Not 50, like you said. And I'll tell you what. This is something no one wants to talk about, except me. That ball was greased. Here we go. Somebody on the defensive line greased that ball before that play. And they could do that in those days. And, I'll tell you why. Because they didn't have those fancy cameras they've got today. Okay, it's time to get ready for dinner! - Hallelujah. - Wait a minute. I'm not done yet. Sorry, grandpa, don't want to disappoint the women. Oh, well, all right. I can start over and we can, uh, cover the whole thing for the ladies. They need to hear this, too. Hey, guys, thanks for letting me sit at the cool table. I was worried I'd be stuck with those old, boring people over there. No problem. You want me to invite Samantha to come sit with us? Don't be so juvenile. Besides, she has to sit next to her lawyer friend. Should I punch him again? Yeah, we need some more footage for our YouTube channel. Luke. We have a seat for you at the adult table. Oh, that's fine. I don't mind hanging with my buds. No, don't be silly. Come on. Sorry, guys, don't want to get in trouble with the boss. Ooh, baby, come to mama. - Somebody order a turkey? - [Samantha] Woah-ho-ho! [exclaiming] Uh, before we start on this delicious meal, as per Banks family tradition, we have asked you to write down something on a piece of paper that you're thankful for. And I have all those responses here in the jar. I'm gonna read them off one by one. And then you have to guess who wrote them. All right? - Let's get to the food. - I know we're going to eat. Don't worry, Charlie. All right, first one. "I am thankful for... Whizzer." Oh, Dad. What? That can be anybody. I gave a very compelling argument about that just a few minutes ago. [John] All right, next one. "I am thankful for low carbon emission vehicles, lawsuits, work out polos and gluten free cookies." Awesome. Literally hate every single one of those things. If I would have been here for this, that would have been mine. I went ahead and filled that one out for you, buddy. You get me, bro. - [John] Okay. - "Samantha." Yeah. No, it actually it just says, "Samantha." Oh, well, I guess someone is thankful for Samantha. Uh, actually, that's what I would have put down, right? I think it was Luke. - Definitely Luke. - Are you serious? Why would you think it was Luke? Uh... What? Yeah, Charlie, why would you think it was Luke? Don't look at me. That was mine. I just look up to you so much, Aunt Samantha. [Linda] Aww. She's so good. [cooing and murmuring] [Samantha] You are so sweet. - [Peyton] You're the best Aunt. - You're the best niece. I love you so much. Uh, maybe we should eat, dad. Okay, but seriously, why did you think it was Luke? Yeah. Charlie, what were you thinking? I'm sorry. That's sweet. Okay. Everyone, I just want to say how thankful I am to the Lord that the people that I love most are here with us to celebrate Thanksgiving. We are truly a blessed family. We have so much to be thankful for. Here, here. - Here, here. - [Annie] Woo! [John] Cheers. Okay, let's say grace. Dear Lord, in heaven. Thank you for this wonderful bounty and the many blessings you have given us. We are so thankful to be together as a family. In Jesus name. Amen. [all] Amen. [John] All right, now... Let's eat! [Linda] Yeah! - I want your pie. - Dessert is later, dad. - Yeah, that's what I want. - This is the salad plate, hun. Oh, sorry. Yes, yes. Yes, yes. One, one more of those. And then he runs back. He runs all the way around... - [Bryce] Oh, yes. - [Charlie] Whoa. Whoo, slippery. Oh, you have to try some on my mom's rolls. They are melt in your mouth, like butter good. Honey. You know I'm not eating any carbs. Not even on Thanksgiving? [Luke] Fantastic. That means more for me. Mm. Linda, have I just died and gone to heaven? These rolls are amazing. You know, if things don't work out with John, - I'm still single. - Oh, Luke, you're gonna make me blush. Luke, are you hitting on my mom? [Luke] Absolutely. Have you tried the rolls? Fair point. Hey. Can you pass those down. So, Bryce, is your family together for Thanksgiving? Um... Actually, I don't know. It's been a while since we had a Thanksgiving together. Do you not like your family? - [Samantha] Charlie? - No, it's fine. We're a family full of lawyers, so you can imagine. [Linda] That's enough gravy, Dad. You know what the doctor said. If I can't enjoy a good meal at Thanksgiving, what's the point in being alive? If I drop dead eating this delicious meal, I'll die a happy man. Fine. Have it your way. - Really? - No, not really. - Give me the gravy. - So, I saw in the news that people are already, like, lining way out the door for Black Friday sales. What? Black Friday now moved to Thursday? Come on. How about a little respect for the holiday? You know, I wish they would get rid of Black Friday altogether. I mean, there's no discount in the world worth being around all those crazy people. Yes. Seriously. Who shops anymore? I buy everything online. Look, we're talking about actual real shopping. Not Magic: The Gathering cards. You are so hot right now, say it again. Magic: The Gathering cards. - Oh, boy. - You guys are so cute. [Linda] Listen, I'm a shopper who loves a good sale as much as anyone. But I have to agree with Luke on this. Why can't families just spend time together? You know, enjoy the autumn leaves. [Grandpa Joe] Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. Right. [Annie] Can you hand me a bowl? [slow, classical instrumental] [Charlie] Hey, man, everything okay? Oh, yeah. Really? Because you... looked like a miserable cuss back here. I dunno. You ever feel like maybe you missed your chance on something? [Charlie] Why? Do you miss something? I don't know. I just feel like maybe my time with Samantha might have passed. And should have made different decisions. You know, back when Annie and I were dating, we came to a crossroads in our relationship. We were this close to parting ways. What happened? Well, as you may know, I'm a huge fan of the original Star Wars saga... but Annie likes the prequels better. That's right. Ouch. Yeah, seriously, I know. So naturally, I had to wonder, "Could I be with someone who thinks so differently from me on something so important?" Yeah. What'd you end up doing? Well, in the end, I looked at her and thought to myself, "Man, she is smoking hot, super smart, and, for some odd reason, into me," I didn't want to screw that up, so... I proposed to her the next day. The rest is history. Plus, we both equally hate the new films. Well, thank you for sharing that story with me. It was an entertaining anecdote. I'm not exactly sure how it applies to my situation, but, something I did not know about my sister. No problem. But seriously, like, I can't speak for Sam but I can tell you what I see... Or what I don't see, which is an engagement ring on her finger. So there might be a little bit of tim... Oh, Ooh. Ooh, scratch that. [groans] Good luck with that. I'm gonna go congratulate her. I'll try to... No, sorry. - [chuckles] - What's goin' on? [sighs] Woah, when did you get here? Don't worry about that. Ah, that'll never stick. She's not in love with him. I can tell by looking in her eyes. You think? Yeah. That's the funny thing about love. You know, sometimes, everybody else knows but you. She just needs a little nudge. That's all. Thank you, Grandpa Joe. Remind me I owe you a cookie, okay? Okay. Now what I need from you is a big distraction... Pie time. Ugh, this looks delicious. Good job, hon. - [Linda] Thank you. - You're welcome. Bryce Jones, Esquire. Oh. Mm hmm. I need to take this. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, hey, did you hear I'm engaged? Yeah, I know. Hey, best man? That would be something. So I uh, just wanted to say congratulations. That seemed to come out of the blue. Were you surprised? - You could say that. - Yeah... Me too. All right, so the money is out of escrow and into the account? Perfect. Yes, that is exactly what I needed to hear. All right. You're the best, man. We'll talk soon. Okay, bye. [Bryce clears throat] Everyone, I have an announcement to make. [John] Yup. We know you're engaged. Come on in. Get some pie. It's not that. Samantha. The meeting I had to go to yesterday was actually with the investors. And I know you were super torn on what to do, so... I went and negotiated on your behalf. And I'm super excited to say that I was able to negotiate an additional 10% on top of the initial offer. And I just confirmed that the money - is in your account. - [chuckles] [staggered clapping] Samantha Jones, Esquire, everyone. Wow. Guess she couldn't contain her excitement. Try again, Esquire. You had no right to do that. [sighs] Shortest engagement ever. Charlie. Bad. You think just because I gave you power of attorney, that you could make this decision - without even consulting me? - Well, frankly, I thought you'd be relieved. You know, I could tell you wanted the decision taken out of your hands and made for you. And I thought an additional $1.5 million would help ease your concerns. - So, yeah. - It was my decision. And I'm not selling Jovie May. I'm keeping my business. Well, that's going to be a problem because the contract was final. All right. There's no way to undo it. Look, this is for the best, all right. And Luke agrees. In fact, me selling the business was his idea. Wait, what? Don't worry about it. Look... we're about to start our lives together, okay? And now you have the time and means to support me as... my career advances. I don't even know what to say to that. [sighs] Actually, I do. This does not look good for Esquire. [Linda] I just want what's best for Samantha. [jazz instrumental] Look, I know this was a big decision to make but once you take a look at your bank account, you're going to feel a lot better about things. Wow, you really only care about money. You probably only proposed to me because of my net worth. - Come on. - Honestly, until today, you always made me feel safe. I can't marry you because... I don't love you. So, that's it? You're just gonna walk away? $1.5 million, Samantha! [sighs] [low chattering] I know you guys were watching. [Annie] Sam, I'm so sorry. [Charlie] He was a tool, anyway, okay? They still say tool, right? Ah, it feels right. Come on over and have a piece of pie. Um, where's the other pumpkin pie? Grandpa may have walked off with it while you guys - were looking out the window? - What? Dad? Look, Sam, I know this is a time sensitive issue but I have a really good entertainment attorney and they can help get you out of airtight contracts. So, should I call? I think you've done enough. Bryce told me this was your idea. - What? - How dare you sit here and tell me I should keep my business and then tell him to sell it right from underneath me? Sam, I would never do that. You should go too. This is a really big misunderstanding. I got calls to make. Wow. That Bryce... he's a real tool, am I right? Charlie? Hmm. Okay. I would love to stay and have pie with you guys, but I just realized I need to leave immediately. So, you guys go ahead without me. I'll check on Grandpa Joe. [sighing heavily] [piano instrumental] John! Linda, get in here! Grandpa Joe! ♪ Look Samantha, I know you don't want to talk to me right now, but there's something I need to tell you. I never told Bryce to sell your company. I made a joke about it because I thought it'd make you want to break up with him. I mean, I made it clear that it was a terrible idea. And, uh, I guess that idiot didn't listen. I am so sorry. And that's not all. I came to spend time with your family this weekend so I could have a second chance with you. Walking away from you was the biggest mistake of my entire life. I want my do over. We belong together. [doctor] Mr. and Mrs. Banks? I can't do this right now. So we ran a lot of tests. Everything came out just fine. Your dad's gonna be just fine. - When can we see him? - Right now. He was actually just asking me where the cafeteria was. I think he's looking for some pumpkin pie. What? ♪ ♪ Where do you think you're going? Someone that looked a lot like you told me I should probably leave. - Is that right? - [Luke] Yeah. Look, because of one of my stupid jokes, you lost your business. I feel horrible. Listen, I'm going to keep fighting for Jovie May. When Bryce sold it, it felt like I was losing a family member. But then Grandpa Joe went to the emergency room and it felt so much worse. You dropped this. "I'm thankful for that day at Lulus and every day after that I spent with Sam." "Even if I lost her, it was worth it." That would have been awkward at the dinner table. Yeah, that's uh, why I snuck it out. It reminds me of something my dad said. He said, "If you love something, you hold on to it, fiercely." You broke up with me but I didn't fight for you. And I want to fight for us, for our future, for our dreams. I love you, Luke Hudson. And whatever our future holds, I... I never stopped loving you. [Annie gasps] I knew it! [kids] ♪ Luke and Samantha, sitting in a tree ♪ - [Peyton] So juvenile. - Dude, Luke. Still my sister, though. Listen, I tried to stop them but they wouldn't wait any longer. I just want to make sure there's no funny business going on. - Grandpa Joe? - [John] Yeah, he's okay. I have no regrets. I'm so happy. I'm so, so, so, so happy. I have a great idea. We should watch Groundhog Day. - With pumpkin pie. - Of course. [Annie] Ow-ow. - Is your family's still there? - Yes. They're so weird.
