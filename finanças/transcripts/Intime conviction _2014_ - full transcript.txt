Why are you out to get me? What have I done? Hello? André? Be quick and we'll cover her. That's enough. - Where are the children? - At my parents. They couldn't see this. Come on. Paul. BYE-BYE ls that all? Be careful. What are you doing? They're doing it! N01 you! Can't you ever stop interfering? INTIMATE CONVICTION I've got two burnt bodies to identify before yours. I'll do the autopsy tomorrow, but at a glance, no signs of violence, she was probably smothered with a pillow as she slept. Hello. I'm Judith Lebrun, Bayonne Police. How come I don't recognise you? I'm from Lyon, I just got here. Where is Perez? I've been placed on the enquiry concerning your wife, following a complaint from her parents. My wife committed suicide. It's hard to accept, but it's the truth. I'm sorry. I can imagine how you're feeling. No, I don't think you can. I already told Guinet everything. My wife was depressed. I gave her Valdoxon and then Deroxat. - You prescribed her drugs? - I am a doctor. Not only with corpses. My wife didn't die from an overdose. She ﬁred a bullet into her own head. Why? I don't know. I ask myself the same question every day. She had a riding accident, it made her feel ugly. She hated the scar it left on her face. My wife liked to charm, that's how she was. Excuse me. Your wife was going on a trip the next day, did you know? Of course. And who was she going with? With me. Where to? To New York. So she had no reason to kill herself. My wife was depressed, Inspector. She had happy phases, which lasted two days, a week... but then it was living hell. My boys and I lived in fear of her moods. It was a nightmare. I'll always blame myself for not doing more. Who was going with her? Do her parents know? No, but I don't think it was the husband. ||Bye_bye.n It's not much of a farewell. We need to check if it's her writing. - Shit! No way! - What? No prints on the gun. Was she wearing gloves? No. What about gunshot residue? Nothing found on her. There must be if she shot herself. What about Villers? Not on him either. There isn't even an autopsy report. What is going on here? Hello, I'm looking for Dr Villers, is that your daddy? Yes, but it's next door. Waiting room is in there. OK, thanks. Give me that. Come see. How many mums would kill themselves in their kids playroom? She must have been here. The bullet entered on the right. Do you think someone could've been behind her? It's a bit tight. - Hello. - Hello. Sorry, I got a bit lost, I'm looking for the doctor. My brother isn't working today. Are you the lady that called? A car accident, wasn't it? Hold on. I think I had you down for tomorrow. Did you do those drawings in there? They're pretty- No. It was my sister-in-law. It's going to be repainted. It's a shame. She's dead. |‘m sorry. - What name was it? - Lebrun. But I'll come back another day. I'll catch you up. What do you want? Hello. This is a private property. Can't you read? Hello. Don't call me this weekend. I'm supposed to be at a seminar. Don't worry. Everything is ﬁne. Everything is ﬁne... It's time for me to be myself. I think my life is going to change. I'll explain when I get back. She sent this to her parents on the day she died. To her father, to be exact, to his email account, he found it after the funeral. He's convinced she didn't commit suicide. Did she get on with her husband? Were they a happy couple? He didn't pay her enough attention. My daughter should never have married him. They had nothing in common. We had them taken three weeks earlier. Manon needed photos to renew her passport. Didn't she have a scar from a riding accident? She had an operation. - Cosmetic surgery? - Yes, I got her the appointment. In her last message, Manon was happy. She seemed to suggest she had met someone. I think that's what she meant. It's me. If Manon had a boyfriend, we need to ﬁnd him. Put Gilbert and Lili on it, interview everyone again. Do whatever you have to. Go through her mobile phone calls. What? Where is Manon Villers‘ phone? It was one of items kept for evidence. I don't have it, maybe Paul Villers collected it. No. This case has been reopened, so he can't have collected her things. I hope... I hope you realise that because of you, sir, we might never found out what happened. No autopsy, no blood or urine analysis. His wife shot herself in the head. End of story. Cause of death was clear. There wasn't a mark on her. Why look any further? To know if a serious illness she had could explain her suicide? To know if she was popping anti-depressants as he claims, or sleeping tablets which might have killed her. No prints on the gun, doesn't that make you curious? You're pissing me off! Villers is a good coroner. I've known him for ten years. - He loved his wife. - I'm not saying he killed her. But whoever it was, we'll now ﬁnd it hard to prove anything. The only lead I have is her mobile phone. I need Manon Villers‘ mobile phone. You've got one hour to ﬁnd it. OK? You'll have it in an hour. It seems it wasn't lost after all. Thank you, sir. Goodbye, Inspector. To us. To us? OK. To a successful restaurant. - To a successful restaurant! - And to you. As my ﬁrst customer, you'll bring me luck. I'm sure I will. I've been given a really rotten case. There was almost no investigation. The victim's body has been cremated. I don't know what to do. Can't you refuse it? You know there's an apartment upstairs. It's true. - Can we sleep here tonight? - No.. - Go on. - I didn't mean that. I don't feel like driving home. Anyone home? Anyone home? Have you been there long? I rang the bell, but... Do you fancy a bit of ham? Why not. Have a seat. Aren't your children here? No, they're at a birthday party. It's strange, you're in her place. - Shall I move? - No, it's ﬁne. Manon left a very joyful message for her parents. At one point she said: "my life is going to change." Yes, she was right. We'd had a rough patch, but it was getting better. So I thought, to make her happy, and to show her that we could start over, I suggested a romantic trip. And she killed herself? What happened that evening? Nothing. We had dinner. Thomas was at swimming. Antoine was sat next to you... Next to her. He went upstairs. We stayed here chatting. What about? About us, about love. Can you be more precise? It was... How can I put this? Affectionate. Do you want the exact words? Yes. I want you. Right now. On the table. I want to fuck you. Then the mood changed. She accused me of not being gentle. It annoyed me. She looked like you do now. The moment was ruined, so I went to watch a ﬁlm in the lounge. And Manon? She was tidying up the kitchen. Then I heard her say she was going to fetch Thomas. I heard a bang but I thought it was the garage door. You didn't recognise a gunshot? But you're an expert in ballistics. No, not for a second. Manon was afraid of guns. She had never touched one, on the other hand, she was a terrible driver. The dog was with me, I took him over there. I didn't want him sniffing around. You didn't go inside? You didn't approach her? I called for help from my office. In there? With all these, your wife could've had a more gentle death. But slower. I'd have found her before she died, and I could have saved her. How did you do it? You could have it removed too. I don't talk about it. It's odd that a woman who cared about her image would blow her own face off, especially after having it ﬁxed. I've never tried to kill myself. And someone else? We've all thought about it. Have you ever shot anyone? Yes, I have. Show us your face. Leave me alone. - Take your hands away. - No. Show me your scar. I love you as you are. Like this? Damaged? What did she say? I love you as you are. Like this? Damaged? "Damn it." She doesn't say "Damn it." Like this? Damaged? Damaged. She says "damaged." He loves her like that, damaged. Stop. You could have it removed too. Are you okay? Info about the father. OK. Tell me. Fernand Villers. Lives next door. Four daughters. Paul is his only son. They've all ﬂown the nest, except the youngest, who is still at home. He's been in prison and was struck off the medical register. What for? A beating that went too far, I reckon a racist attack. It was in '61, during the Algerian War. He's known for being racist. A real charming guy. And Manon‘s phone? We've been through the calls, one number comes up a lot in the last three weeks. A certain Hedi Himer. Coffee? No, thanks. I met her in the university library. Manon asked me about an author. We often met there. We talked about literature. I was in love. Sade, Bataille, "120 Days of Sodom", "The Arab Handbook of Love", "lreneﬂs Cum n I'm a specialist in erotic literature, from 18th century to today, it's not dirty mags. Where did you and Manon see each other? Sometimes here in the afternoons. Mostly at the university. Or in the countryside. - She never stayed the night? - No. ls the bathroom through there? You phoned her shortly before her death. We were going away together, to Turin in Italy. Where were you the last time you called her? I don't know, probably at the university. And did she sound depressed to you? Anxious. She'd invented a story about a seminar to be with me. He followed her several times. Different neighbourhoods, she's wearing different clothes. She doesn't know he's there. Or she's pretending not to see him, and it turns her on. Pretty hot, huh? I think it turns him on more. It's like rape, I wouldn't like it. - You always want control. - That's not true. - Got anything on him? - Nothing. Not even a parking ticket. Right. - See you Monday. - See you. - Bye. - See you. I like these snaps, they give me ideas. Don't even think about it. She's beautiful. He tells us something about her. She's different in his photos. See? It's the way he sees her which is different. He loves her. He appropriates her. It's different. Yes, maybe, but he loves her. And you must taste the stuffed squid. Okay. Dad! Go! That's Villers. - Come on, Thomas! - Stop! I don't want to! - Stop it! - Come on, move it! I don't want to! ls he crazy or something? What the hell are you doing? ls that how your wife fell off? Morning to you too. - No, she stood behind my horse. - Your son could've been hurt. How I teach them is my business. They need to overcome fear. Like in the army? I bet you could ride well. We should go for a ride one day. A little gallop in the woods might help us to get along. Did you know your wife had a lover? My wife was faithful. She was going away with him, not to New York, to Italy. That man wasn't her lover. He stalked her. She told him that so he'd leave her alone. We even laughed about it together. I love your hair like that. Reminds me of Manon when we ﬁrst met. Bye. You two seem to get on well. I hate men like him. Let's go. Come on. Who was she going away with? The husband or the lover? We're not sure Hedi Himer was Manon Villers‘ lover. Have I missed something? In her diary, Manon describes a certain H.H. with erotic detail, but we can't say if it's just a fantasy or if they had an affair. Hold on, what's all this about a diary? Where did you get it? From a box at Villers‘ house. He was throwing out her things. Tell me you had a search warrant. Right? No, but he didn't notice a thing. This is totally irresponsible. We can't use it now, because of how you obtained it. We don't need it. When Himer called that day, he was by her house. We traced the location of his mobile calls. He was obsessed, he followed her everywhere. A bit more digging might pay off. OK. But consult me before you do anything. Understood? Yes, sir. Was it you who borrowed my ﬁlms? Which ﬁlms? You're a bad liar for a cop. If you'd asked, I'd have shown you these. Here. It's a shame we didn't meet earlier. I'd have enjoyed working with you. Why give me these? Are you going to marry your friend, Inspector? I like calling you Inspector, I really like it. I don't like him, if he comes near you again, I'll kick his ass. It's okay, I can look after myself. OK? Come on, Manon. Wait! It's a straight line. You're holding back! Come on. No, get back on your horse! - I got hit by a branch. - Don't talk rubbish. Get back on! I'm scared. Scared of what? Get the horse straight. - He doesn't respond. - Don't be soft. Make him obey. I don't want to, I want it to be fun. You're holding back. Come on, Manon. Get back on. Are you okay? Move! ls he taking us for a ride? What's he doing? He's running away. Slop! Go that way! Slop! OK, take it easy. Where are you going? I came to see my brother, he's a mechanic. What's in the bag? Were you going to leave with him? Are you leaving France? Presents for nieces and nephews. Any more questions? Yes, how long have you been into photography? Have you photographed other women? Passers-by? Strangers? Listen to this, you'll enjoy this too. "Through his heroine's fantasies, the author raises the erotic tension "between the young girl and the butcher, seen as an ogre. "Disgust turns to excitement "as he describes the butcher's belly and blood-stained apron, "his chopping block and his blade slicing through ﬂesh, "the penis-like sausages, "and lovemaking among the offal." I'm turning vegetarian. "Erotic Death - Hedi Himer." If you've nothing else to accuse me of, I'd like you to leave me alone. Was it because she was married to a coroner? We're not ﬁnished. You're fascinated by that stuff. You always write about the same subject. What subject are you talking about? Eroticism which leads to crime. They're only words! Do you understand? Words! And this? ls this literature as well? Look at her. What were you doing there the night she died? She was scared of her husband's reaction. That's why I called her. To tell her I was nearby. Did that reassure her? What did she say to you? That she loved me, and she couldn't wait to go away. Are you sure it wasn't that you scared her and she was sick of you hanging around. The real Manon, The woman I loved... Nobody else knew her. Have you seen this man before? Do you know him? Your daughter-in-law's lover. Get out! Did you come here to insult us? Not even Manon would have chosen a sand nigger from the desert over my son. The sand nigger is a professor. I don't care. You're angry, but not surprised. So you knew. And you've already had problems with the law. You don't like Arabs, do you? It must be hard seeing them together. He's not her lover. My son would never allow her to cheat on him. She'd have been afraid of the consequences. The consequences? - Did your son ever threaten her? - No. What about you? You're the head of the family. Yes, but I didn't threaten her, and I didn't kill her. Go and ask that Arab, he was snifﬁng around and when she rejected him, he killed her. We'll follow all leads, you can rest assured. I've seen them in action, I know what they're like. Ferdinand. The French treated them well and helped them develop. Some of my friends had wonderful farms. - Know what happened to them? - No. Have you heard of the "Kaby|e Smile"? Take that! That's a nice gun. Let me see. It's a good replica. It looks real. - Have you got a gun? - Yeah. Can I see it? It is real? Can I borrow it? Don't touch, buddy. You don't play with this kind. Dad lets me. - You play with his guns? - Yeah. You are lucky. I'll walk you back. That cop was insulting us with photos of that sand nigger. - Don't get involved, Dad. - Since when do you give me orders? You've made a real mess of your life. - Don't be horrible. - Couldn't even keep your wife. Stop! Stop criticising me all the time! I'm not ﬁfteen anymore! It's your fault that Manon... Shut up! I saw that bitch kissing him outside my house. What are you still doing here? I walked him back. He was playing near my car. He said you let him play with you guns. No, it's not me, it's Thomas. What does he do? He's making it up. Stop lying, you. I'll deal with you later. I swear. Stop hanging around my kids. Don't speak to them again. Now get out! Now! Very well. "Sometimes we get bored wishing a body we no longer want. "With him I become a character in a novel, "not an annoying bitch. "When I read, "| can dream, "and escape this future which terrifies me." "I'd have wanted him, even if he hadn't been handsome, "the excitement of words never dies. "Paul crumpled before my eyes. "He was incapable of protecting me. "A weak, obedient, little boy, dominated by his father." Shit. "It's time for me to be myself. "| think my life is going to change. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. The restaurant opening. I completely forgot. I'm sorry. - Why didn't you answer your phone? - Was it you? - Yes, it was me. - Oh, I'm sorry. - Sorry. - It's OK. ls it really that fascinating, the life of... - Marion, was it? - Manon. Give it back. Give it to me. What she says about her husband is very interesting. Listen, she convinced him to stop paying rent, to force the father-in-law to let them move out. But the old man is a real tough nut. - He turned up with a riﬂe. - Really? In their house. Listen to this: "Paul crumpled before my eyes, "he's a weak, obedient, little boy, "dominated by his father, incapable of protecting me. "| no longer have any desire for him." I also saw Villers humiliated yesterday. I bet he's not so keen on you now. - You could be his next victim. - It's not funny! I think I've found a house. She had her accident six months later. Weird, no? - It's weird. - Yes, I suppose. "| no longer have any desire for him." OK, OK. Your brother shoots better than me. He got 90 out of 100, and I'm the one who is a cop. But you're good with guns. It's amazing. How many guns have you got? I haven't counted. If anything happens to me, you'll know who to blame. Stop it. You should try wearing a dress too, and stop playing supercop, it would suit you. Pierre. - Hello? - Hi, Max, this is Judith. I looked at the photos you sent. It probably wasn't a contact shot, but one or two centimetres away. That's strange for a suicide. If they shot her from a few feet away, they could have then ﬁred into the wound with a riﬂe. A hunting riﬂe? Then dropped the pistol, to look like a suicide. But without the body it's hard to prove it. And gunshot residue? Some on the husband's hands. The experts missed it. - But I checked Villers‘ clothes. - And? There's some on his T-shirt, but there should be more. What does your intuition tell you? Suicide can't be ruled out, but it could be much more twisted. Shit. Pierre, can I come sleep at your place? You? You wanted to know what Manon felt. Now you know. Yes, fear. Was it you last night? Was that you? - No. - It wasn't you? No. I bet you kept a little souvenir. Give me the phone, Manon. What's this? What are you ﬁlming? My back? My neck? What? Your neck or your ass? Give me the phone, Manon. I don't want to live without you. What? I don't want to live without you. Neither do I. Manon Villers didn't commit suicide. She was left-handed, the shot came from here. So she'd have had to use her less favoured right hand. Why would she do that? Her position suggests she was pleading with her killer. That's a rather dramatic interpretation. - Maybe she was steadying herself. - Then she'd have used the toy box. No, Villers would have had more residue on him. It doesn't add up. He could have changed before calling it in. He said he put on pyjamas when he got in, but later he was in a tracksuit. Or someone else ﬁred the shot. Who? Himer? - He wasn't far way. - Neither was Villers‘ father. He has a key to his son's house. He probably didn't like seeing Manon kissing an Arab. He's got a riﬂe, and he would use it. If it was him, Paul would never tell us. All the riﬂes are over there. At your son's? He only collects pistols and revolvers. Don't you ever go hunting? Where were you that night? At the billiards club, like every Friday. At least ten people saw me. Your turn. - What time did you return? - Wait. Before I answer, I want a lawyer. Just tell me which club, and what time you got back. I'm positive, Your Honour, even a strong blow to a correctly held gun, cannot make the gun ﬁre. I don't care what the Swiss expert says. He's mistaken. And I'll tell him so in court. Yes, goodbye. Are you always so polite? It depends. Your father has a riﬂe. Why? What has he done with it? I don't follow you. I'm talking about the riﬂe he pointed at your head. It seems to be a habit of his. Did he threaten your wife too, or only you? Goodbye, Inspector. Why are you protecting him? Did he protect you and your sisters? Goodbye. What is it? The old man's alibi checks out, we can't hold him. Shit. - And the riﬂe? - We can't ﬁnd it. - Know what I think? - What? The riﬂe wasn't his. - He went to see Paul... - He found it at his son's house. ls anyone there? This can't be happening. ls anyone there? Shit! No signal. Oh, shit. Shit. Are you OK? Good thing I heard you, you'd have been here all night. And you could have done my autopsy. It's ten degrees in the cold chamber. You'd only have caught a cold. Do you enjoy scaring women? Your father has taught you well. Come on. Don't ever touch me again. Fuck it! What's he doing here? - What are you best at? - Sorry? - Which stroke? - Butterﬂy and 100m Backstroke. - I swim in competitions. - Do you train a lot? Three times a week. Don't you mind coming home on your own? I've been taking the bus since I was nine. Dad! Dad! Dad! What is it? What's the matter? I'm here now. Don't be scared. My little boy. Emile, it's me. Are you awake? I am now. Villers couldn't have thought Manon was going out. She was scared of driving at night. She couldn't judge distances in the dark. Her son told me. She never picked him up at night. - Can't it wait until tomorrow? - This is important. She wasn't going to collect Thomas. He stopped her leaving, he killed her! You hear me? He killed her. Pierre? You scared me. You scared me too. - Was he here? Did he do that? - Who? No, I slipped and smashed a pane of glass. Can you help me? I can't do it with one hand. - Hello. - Hello. - Judith. - What? A former colleague of Villers, she reported him a few months ago when he threatened to shoot her with his riﬂe. - Well? - Nothing yet. - We've got something! - There is a disc inside. - Get photos and bring it in. - OK. - Go get Villers. - Look. - It was behind the wood. - Good work. Vi“! Get a photo. I don't remember. Don't remember the riﬂe, or don't remember hiding it? I don't know why it was here. - It should be with all the others. - Yes, but I don't remember it. But you deﬁnitely used one to threaten Dr Catherine Rouvier. Take a good look. Was it this one? I don't know. Maybe. I thought Manon had got rid of it. Are you sure? Coffee? No, thanks. That riﬂe in your attic. ls it the one your father threatened you with? He's always been like that. Melodramatic. - You think he'd have shot me? - You seemed to. He's bitter. He wanted me to be what he couldn't be. A famous doctor or surgeon. Yes, corpses are less classy. After the riﬂe incident, Manon backed away from you, that must have been hard for you. She had an accident. Because she was afraid of horses. Then why did she ride? To be with me as often as possible. We were a close couple. You're an excellent horseman. Couldn't you stop your horse from kicking? It's a horse's reﬂex. I was ﬁlming, I was distracted, we were arguing. Did you feel guilty? No. It did suit you to put her in that state. You formed a really close couple. - What is it? - You've got nothing on him. He tried to kill her once and failed. He succeeded two years later. First an accident, then suicide. He's very cunning. I want proof, - or a confession. - We found a riﬂe at his house. We can't prove he used it, we've no corpse. - Are his prints on it? - No. Just his two sons'. We matched them to ones on the toys. It seems they played with it. Any defence will enjoy proving that it was the kids who hid it. And Villers wife was clinically depressed. Torn between two men. Unable to stay, unable to leave, she chose another way out. We have no reason to doubt it was suicide. So leave Villers alone. Understood? You OK? Yeah. This is the ﬁlm Villers was watching that night. He recorded it. Thanks. Have you watched it? Not yet. What are you working on? I'm looking for another angle, something we might have missed. When Himer phoned, he heard Villers shouting at his wife. He accused her of having a lover. Himer isn't a reliable witness. Why not? Because he's into erotic ﬁction? No, because he was there. He could've got into the house. How would he have known where the gun was? I don't know, but I think we shouldn't just focus on the husband. Maybe Himer got jealous because he couldn't bear losing her. He loved her. So? Villers loved his wife too. No, perhaps Himer lost his cool. - What do you mean? - Maybe... - they hadn't got intimate. - Get real! Yes. Just hear me out. She liked the fact that he desired her, but maybe didn't go much further. Let me get back to work. And the older Villers, he could have gone out without being noticed. Himer saw him go inside. Not necessarily, you know as well as I do! You know what? You're obsessed with Paul Villers. That's the problem. You need to open your eyes. You open your eyes! Villers was constantly humiliated by his father, he has to give the image of a perfect life and family. If you touch that nerve, he's dangerous! Be careful not to make this personal. It's my word against his, don't you see? I have to stop him, or he'll pass it off as suicide or an accident and he'll do it again. Are you serious? You're delusional, Judith. - Delusional. - Yeah, right. Whatever you say. Judith. where were you last night? Did you get my message about the house? The house? Remember? We decided to live together. They want an answer soon. - Can you come and see it? - Now? I can't. - When then? - I don't know. This is the life of a cop! - What's wrong? - Let me go! I exist too. I'm not just entertainment - for the big important cop! - Let go! The police got the call from Paul Villers at 9:47 pm, 45 minutes after the body was discovered. The ﬁlm Paul Villers was watching started at 8:40, OK? He recorded it. But when he turned off the TV to go out to the garage, the video switched off too. The recording lasts 22 minutes, so it was exactly 9:02. That doesn't add up. There's a gap of 45 minutes. What did he do in that time? Why didn't he call the police? He has a motive, his wife was cheating on him. He can't bear her leaving him for another man. He has the knowledge, he's an expert, capable of making it look like suicide, but, most of all, he had the time to do it. I don't remember, I was in shock. I was shaking. I lost sense of time, I didn't look at my watch. OK, Mr Villers, what were you wearing the night your wife died? - A tracksuit. - You previously said pyjamas. Same difference. Between 9:02 and 9:47, you had plenty of time to change. There was a lot of blood. Like at your friend's? ls he better? What's my friend got to do with it? Are you OK? You look tired. You should take a break. You were there. He didn't do it himself. I had a friend who was in the bar. He saw what happened and he told me. It must have been shocking. Was there blood on your pyjamas? I was wearing a tracksuit. I didn't go near her. I didn't touch her. When I saw her, I knew what had happened. There was nothing I could do. I loved her face so much, I didn't want to... You didn't want to do what? Kill her? I didn't want to look at her. I couldn't. I've changed my mind. Call my lawyer. From now on, say nothing. Until I see the ﬁle, I can't help you. - So we play it safe, OK? - OK. What did you do after you found your wife's body? I drank water. - Paul, I said... - Quiet, counsellor, you cannot interrupt at this stage. From a glass? No. From the tap, I think. So you washed your hands? I don't know, what are you insinuating? Manon killed herself. An act of madness. You tried to drive her mad, but she wasn't. Not all women are hysterical, despite what you say. My wife had bouts of depression, long before she met me. Like her mother. You can check that. You owe the truth to your children. A mother's suicide is destructive, they'll feel guilt all their lives and they'll feel they weren't loved enough. It wasn't how you think. How did it happen then, Paul? I loved my wife! I loved her! Yes, but she was going to leave you. You forced her to admit it. You couldn't bear her being with another man. She wasn't depressed, she was happy. Yes, my wife was happy. We'd decided to go away, to New York. We spoke about love, not breaking up. No. You argued that night, I know you did. She left to see Himer on foot, not by car. She went out the side door because you were blocking the other. You followed her. You threatened her with the gun you had taken from your room. She hid in the games room, you ﬁred in anger, you regretted it afterwards, but it was too late. So you made her death look like suicide. - I'm tired. - Do you want to eat? We offered, he refused.
