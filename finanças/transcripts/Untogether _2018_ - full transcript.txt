No, I mean I'm not, like, available, you know, ever. No, I mean, when did you split up with your girlfriend? Oh, um, yesterday. Was that after the party, after we met? Yeah, I felt so bothered by how much I flirted with you at the party that I broke up with her afterwards. Right, right. She was in love with me. I mean, we weren't together that long, but she was, she was, she was in love. Maybe she wasn't as in love with you as you think. Maybe she was just in love with the man in your book. No. Used to happen to me all the time. Still does, actually. Sorry, I've, uh, I haven't got round to reading your book. No, I remember, like, wanting to when it first came out, when there was all the fuss about it, you know? Mm, it was all fuss. You might have told me that you had a girlfriend before I came over.

So, he fell in love with a Palestinian woman when he was a volunteer doctor in Gaza, and then she ended up getting killed. I can see how that would sell a million copies. Mm, two. Does he fuck heroically? All one night stands are acts of bravery. Or defeat. Hey, if you're going to work, do you think you could give me a lift down the hill? Andrea, you really need to learn how to drive, you know that? Or else you're just not really engaging with the city at all. It's better this way. I get more writing done. Why, 'cause you're trapped? Yeah, it's good. So, can you give me a lift? I slept with someone I just met last night. Was that whore-ish? Was that a whore-ish thing to do, do you think? Oh, well. You have a whore-ish vibe about you. How? How? Your clothes, your hair, I mean, your manner, really. When I first met you, I thought, she's, uh, she'd be open to anything. - That is not true. - I know. I know it's not, and I know that you've moved down here, you have got yourself clean, you go to your meetings. You got yourself together. Yeah, I have, it's been a year. Right, so? This is the first untogether thing you've done in a year. That's not really a big deal, is it? What do you think of these Clooney news? Haven't you heard he wants to play you in the adaptation? Uh, I kinda think that George Clooney looks like a dirty old uncle. Oh, god, no, were you abused? No. Ah, ah. You saw a bestselling memoir right there in front of your eyes, didn't you? No, no, I mean, I don't know, maybe. You're something else. No, no, no, I'd take any book you had to offer me, you know that. I'm just waiting for you to tell me what it is. Otherwise, why would I be here sweating in California when I could be in civilization? I'm sorry, it was a happy childhood. No, no, good, that's good. Good, jolly good. Look, I'm a doctor. I wrote a book that moved people. I don't really know anything about his world of celebrity, - all that's... - Hi, um, I just wanted to tell you that your book is the most beautiful love story I have ever read in my entire life. Oh, thank you. - Okay. - Nice seeing you. Thanks. Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye. What are you thinking about? I was trying to conjure up what Naima looked like. It's been too long now that I feel I've almost lost her. No, she's on the page forever. She's in our hearts forever. Oh, no, I'll get this. - No, I'd like to. - Oh, no, no. 'Cause I can expense it. Don't be ridiculous. No, no, no, I would like to because you're a woman and I'm a man. - You're really beardy. - Mm. I've done everything I can, but it's pretty hard with the... Yeah, I know, it's limiting. I told my wife it would be but she said this is one great anniversary present. Mm. It's not you. You're very good, actually. I know. - Oh, what is that, it's... - Really soothing. It's got a little bit of orange, a little bit of clove, - and myrrh. - That sounds biblical. Yes, I do a toner, and then I do a microdermabrasion, and then I take a sword and I sacrifice you to a vengeful lord. Just kidding. God steps in and saves you at the end. So what do you do? I'm a rabbi. - You're kidding. - No. You're just saying that because of what I just said. You're just making fun of me because you have a beard... That I grew just so I can tell people I'm a rabbi? No, why are you so surprised? I just didn't think that you'd be able to, to do something like this. - Why? - Wasn't it vain? It feels vain, yeah. Do you feel like an asshole? I, uh. I'm sorry, I'm a really bad Jew. I feel weird even touching you, like I'm touching the Torah on my period or something. I'm not, I finished four days ago. Three days ago. Oh, well, that explains a lot, I guess. Thanks for sharing. I'm sorry. Am I blotchy at all? No, you're glowing. Oh, good, yeah. I feel like a foreskin. I don't know why I said that. Listen, Tara, thank you very much. Aw, thank you. You did great. It was a lot of hard work, believe me. All right, bye. I wish that I had asked my dad more about Jew stuff, but I don't really think that he even knew that much himself. I mean, he grew up in England and they kinda kept it quiet. My grandparents sent him to boarding school when he was four so he would become less Jewish. That is awful. Listen, if you wanna reconnect with your roots, feel free to come to my congregation, okay, I think you'd really enjoy it. Okay. Come before I die. You don't write very well for a writer. Um, I'm a doctor. I could do a post-coital removal of your spleen but I think you'd be even less inclined to sleep with me again. - Again? - Yeah. What? I thought it went well. It went well like a Scrabble game? Look, we can have a fling, if you want, an affair. A flingair? Yeah, a flingair. How would you define that? Something that's so light as air that neither one of us could possibly get hurt. You know, I bought my cousins a toy once called a flinger. It was this sort of long, stretchy jelly hand thing, and you could fling it at other kids or, if you were feeling bold, at an adult. Um, did you take my shirt? No. Maybe we're just better as a one off. You know, like all those beautiful one hit wonder bands. No, no, I wanna see you again. I just, I guess I feel that I don't wanna have to call you. If you don't want to call me and you do want to have sex with me, then how will I know if you want sex? I'll text you. You look really great. Thank you, you too. It's been a really long time. Did you fall in love again? You must have, tell me, you did, you must, because you love love so much. Why, did you? No, I didn't fall in love. I did get married again, though. Wow, you like getting married. Oh, the first one doesn't count, right? I mean, you were practically a child bride. Oh, sure. And are you still taking smack? Yeah, yeah, I do, I do still take heroin. I smoke it. You, um? Uh, you know, I got clean. - 20th time lucky. - Ah. But you're so different to her. Yeah, well, I had Good Dad. You saw me when he died, he was the love of my life. It's not her memory of him. How old? - What? - No, no, your dog. Your dog, no, six? Six. Ha, yeah, you're really good at that. Thank you, she broke up with me for a month and all I did was sit on the couch watching The Dog Whisperer, so. Ugh. Baby, I've got some news. What? I have, uh, I got a gig. The house behind The Canyon Store? No, no, no, not that type of gig. Like, I mean, like a gig gig. I am putting the band back together. - What? - Yeah, yeah. Just, I mean, just for a night, - just for a night. - Oh, my god. But if it goes well, if it goes well, then I'm gonna do it for another night. And then another night, and then another night, and then another night, and. Mm. The internet is actually fast food that you can eat without chewing. That's his wife. Yes, it's made the world a smaller place, - they say, - I've met her. But is that really a good thing? She can be a controlling bitch. Libraries are the loneliest place in town... I'm Rachel. I'm the daughter. - Oh, hi. - Hi. The things we need most are not informational. Can Siri Google your soul? I'd like to end tonight by reminding you that at the end of the month, we have our rally for our Syrian refugees. I'd like you all to be there because somebody was there for us when we came. Somebody was there for your grandfather when he came. Somebody was there for your great-grandfather when he came. Somebody was there. So be there for them. Shabbat shalom. Hello, again. Thank you. Hi. I had a feeling I would see you here. - You did? - I did, I did. How does my skin look? - Fine. - Good. This is actually my first time at a temple ever. - Really? - Yeah. Except for, um, when my dad died last year. - I'm sorry. - We were more cultural Jews. - Bagels... - Woody Allen. Albert Brooks. Albert Brooks, Lost in America, fantastic movie. Your daughter is really nice. No, she's not. I'm just kidding, yes, she's lovely, thank you. I had nothing to do with that, believe me. Will you come to the rally at the end of the month? I can't, my boyfriend is actually playing a show that night, he's a musician, he used to be a rock guy before I knew him, before I was born. No, just kidding. But, uh, yeah, I should go to that. Okay. Why don't you bring him next time? - He's not Jewish. - It doesn't matter. We extend the branch to people of all faiths. And you see how important music is to the service. I'd love you to bring him. This was a rocking Shabbat, was it not? Yes. Wait, is it Talia? No, it's Tara. Oh, my bad, I Italianized you, which is the secret wish of all Jewish women. What are you wearing? It smells amazing. I don't think it's anything. That's all, that's natural? Yes. Oh, so the last time I saw you, I was naked - and covered in honey. - Hello. I work at a spa. - Okay. - Okay. Tara, thank you so much for coming. - Thank you. - It was delightful - to see you again. - Yes. - I appreciate it. - Can I, you know who she - really reminds me of? - Who is that, dear? Maria Schneider in Last Tango in Paris. - Oh. - I... - No, I'm telling you. - I'll Google it. Maybe not. - It's rather racy. - Oh. She's a grown woman. - Okay. - Okay. - Shabbat shalom. - Shabbat shalom. Shabbat shalom. He marched with Martin Luther King in the civil right movement. He's like this electric, famous orator. He's a total, total rockstar. Is he a charlatan? No, why would you say that? I wouldn't trust anyone you called a rockstar. Except Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young. You trust all four of them? No, not Neil. I don't know why, though, there's something... Is it because he looks like a horse peed on his jeans and he just left them on and let them dry in the sun? - Yes. - Mm-hmm. Why are you wearing a bloke's shirt? This is just my nightie. You had a one night stand, now you're wearing his nightie. It's mine, I earned it. It's not even a good one. How do you know? 'Cause I used to be able to afford them. Stop. You should send it back. You know where he lives? 'Cause you don't wanna be smelling it and giving you ideas. What ideas? Well, that it's more than a one night stand. It's not, I said that. He actually asked me if I wanted to have an affair, and I said no. ♪ I watched the sun go down ♪ On the USA ♪ Suburban boulevards ♪ Cities in decay ♪ People in dismay Do I own you now? - Yeah. - Yeah? ♪ I heard the sun go down Okay, I'm late for work, but I told Andrea that you were here in case she wanted to do the groceries. And I might be, uh, late home again tonight because I think I'm gonna stop by the temple again. Hmm. Again, already? Yeah, I just, I've been missing Dad a lot, and I feel like it's a good place to connect with him. I understand. ♪ Wasted on the beach ♪ What a scene When I was 13, we were living on the Lower East Side of New York City, and two floors above us was a young man named Mickey Schwerner. Ah, that's a Jewish name. That's like being called Joey Rabinowitz. Well, Mickey and his wife Rita lived two floors above us, and he was older than I was, but he was very good to me in a way that older boys are not 'cause they don't like to be seen with the little kids. Mm-hmm. And they were activists. They worked for CORE. CORE? Congress of Racial Equality. Hmm, that would definitely be an abs class now. And they were very brave people. They were Freedom Riders in the truest sense. They would go down South and register African Americans to vote. They would boycott businesses until they desegregated. Mm-hmm. They were very inspiring young people, and it was Mickey who taught me about Dr. King. And I read everything I could. And I listened to him whenever I could. And I just was awestruck. I know you make a solid living, but I've never seen you actually painting. I am starving. Do you wanna get breakfast? Doing the walk of shame, huh? No, I don't feel shame. Oh, you should. It's a very useful emotion. You are so fucking judgmental. You must have been a shit rockstar. No, I was good, actually, and beloved, which your sister will find out when she comes to see the show. I sat next to Mickey just so by osmosis I thought I could become a better person, you know? But it doesn't work by osmosis, no, you have to walk the walk, talk the talk, ride the bus. And 50 years later, organize a rally for Syrian refugees. Sorry, I didn't mean to say Syrian refugees like it was a bad thing. It is a bad thing. Is that pink? Are you gonna be doing a cover of Barbie Girl? - By Aqua? - Yeah, I fucking know who sings Barbie Girl. You've got me pegged wrong, sister. You've got me in the one hit wonder count, but I had two hits. Two bites at the cherry, so. You know, I have a picture, George Harrison, in my office, because I thought he was the one Beatle that was truest to his ideals. Yeah, he also spoiled at least three classic albums with his love of sitar. Wait, um, do you guys want to come with me tonight to a book party? She's busy. Okay. Well, do you want to come? No. No, you're rude. You're rude. You look like velvet but you're Velcro, scratchy. So then what happened with Mickey Jewinowitz? Mickey was murdered in 1964 in Mississippi along with two fellow civil rights workers, James Chaney, Andrew Goodman. They were beaten, shot to death, and buried by members of the KKK. Long time ago. But that's what got me started. I didn't know where that story was going. I'm sorry, I was just trying to make you laugh, and... Tara, no, no, no. You didn't know what I was about to say. So, what did you wanna ask me? Oh, um, your boyfriend is a musician, yes? Yeah. Oh, so I was thinking that maybe you could talk to him about organizing an interfaith concert in support of the rally. Uh, - yep. - Yes? - Okay. - I think it'd be spectacular. I will do that when I get home. - Thank you very much. - Okay. I'm really sorry about Mickey. Thank you. Hey. Oh. I'm Sevan. Seven, like a Seven Nation Army. No, it's just like Evan with an S on the front. Hmm. You're dressed in all '50s. '60s. You know, I once wrote a story for The Paris Review, it's about this beautiful girl, she worked in a vintage store... I don't work in a vintage store. I'm a writer. Oh, that's fantastic. Oh, man, you should definitely work in that until you make it. You know, don't give up. I'm a published author. Okay, okay. So, what's the book about, that you're trying to get published? It's been published in several different languages. Hey. Hi. Where's my wine? I don't work here. Oh no? - Yeah. - Oh. You look like more of a waitress than I do. Hey. Hi. Fancy seeing you here. Yeah, I didn't know you knew Ben and Ginny. - Yeah, hi. - Hello. I like your vintage dress. Thanks, it's my superhero costume. Is it? Always. Um, you are quite the amazon. That's why she's good to have at a party where we're trying to sell a lot of books. Hey. Hey. Do you know Andrea Moore? She wrote Anxiety is Freedom when was, what, 23? Oh, yes, of course, great book. Right, right, so, who are you, mate? Sorry, who are you? Oh, I don't matter. Come on, man, everyone matters. Everyone's got a good book in them too, you know? I don't. I'd better go. Sorry, man. No, can I talk to you for a moment? Yeah. I, I, I do not like that guy. And I don't like this party. - I'm going. - I'm staying. How are you gonna get home? Yes, I do remember that book. It wasn't bad at all, although I don't agree with the philosophy behind the Anxiety is Freedom. Even understand anxiety, it's such a foreign concept to me. You can go, it's fine. What would you sister say if I just abandoned you here? She doesn't care. She doesn't do what you want her to do, why would you do what she wants you to do? Ugh. So, you're English, are you? - Yes. - Yeah, where are you from? Golders Green. - Golders Green. - Yeah. Yes, I know, Golders Green, on the end of the tube line. Yeah.

I hate it. I didn't wanna spoil the surprise, but I've written you a song. I don't wanna hear it right now. I'll play it for you tomorrow night. Okay. Why weren't you answering me? I was going crazy. My cat had actually had an emergency sex change. It cost $5,000. They found, like, crystals got caught in his urine and they actually blocked his penis, so they had to remove the entire thing. It kinda felt like a sign, I mean the castration part. I think we should break up. Why? If what we're having is meaningless, what meaning is there in breaking up? Have you lost weight? Why? Your boobs look smaller. Do you want your money back? No, Jesus, what do you think of me? Look, you were just so sad last time you were here, I was worried. So worried that you had to leave while I was sleeping. I had to clear my head. I really don't know you. I mean, other than your memoir. Look, I'm a good guy, really. I know, it says so in your novel. R.E.M. I don't want to listen to R.E.M. right now. Okay, right, R.E.M., they were seen as hollow just because they were so fucking popular, but they were special. And just because they were on the fucking radio all the time, it doesn't negate the songs that Michael Stipe wrote. Are you saying that you are the Michael Stipe of this situation? You know, I loved the part in your novel where you say... Wait. - ...that the mouth... - I'm sorry. You read my novel? Of course, I had to. I had to piece it together. We have great sex. Thank you. No, I mean, it's not you, it's just chemistry. Okay. What do you think it means? I think it means that we are compatible in some way. But you don't want that. No, and neither do you. Thank you. Hello, there. Um, so, we are in a little bit of a delay right now. There's a lot of traffic, people can't get here. I guess the moral of the story is don't schedule a rally during rush hour in Los Angeles. But people are coming in. We're hoping for a very large turnout because this is such, such a test of people's compassion. Okay. Thank you. Okay, the ones that are here are really passionate. Oh, please don't. There's nobody here. - Well... - I can't. - No, there's... - Jo. There's a really big accident... - Jo. - Okay. - They're coming, though. - Jo, Jo. We don't even have enough for minion man march. What is wrong with people? - Hi. - Oh, hey, hey. - Hello. - Hello. - Nice, um. - Andrea. This is my girlfriend's big sister. Big sis, the older one. Let's go. - You, you don't know. - Nice to meet you. - It's so smoky, it's like... - Well, it is a club. Yeah, but I can't sing. Can't you stop being such an old man? Not really. Where is she? Uh, I mean, she must be on her way. She's probably having trouble parking. I have to do something, I'm sorry. What? It's going to help, I promise. Oh, no, no. - No, no, no, no. - Please, please. Fuck off, fuck off. I want you to look great. Look, I'm, I'm old, I mean. Yeah, but you can be old and sexy too. I just, uh. All right, oh, sorry.

There wasn't really a Naima. So who was there? No one, he's just a man alone with a story in his head. That is so fucked. Are you pissed? - Uh, no. - Why? Because we all make up stories, we all lie. I don't. Yes, you do. You lie to yourself that the rabbi was going to marry you. I'm not saying that as a judgment, I'm really not. I mean, I, I've been lying that I am finishing my book. You are finishing your book. - You're almost done. - No, I'm absolutely not. The only thing I wrote this summer was a few clever texts to Nick. Oh, and I wrote an essay. That's good. I sent it out about two weeks ago. Still waiting to hear back. Oh, you'll like this. You copy edited the Torah? Yeah. There were too many ands. Look, I'll show you. And Abraham went up out of Egypt, and he went on his journey from the South to Bethlehem, and Abraham called out in the name of the Lord. It's too much. But you read it? Mm-hmm. The whole thing? Yes. So you really are a doctor? I really am a doctor. And you really did volunteer in Gaza? Yeah. But there wasn't a Naima. There was an Arab girl at a McDonald's that I thought was really pretty. What? She stayed in my head. And what happened to her? She just stayed in my head. Wow, really, that's amazing. That's real writing. That's experience strained through imagination. Do you know that? You know, I only lied about love. That was the only thing I lied about. That's why everyone is so upset. If you had lied about anything else, they would have forgiven you by now. Then my editor said that she knew all along that there was something hollow about the heart of all this. She didn't. No. She actually wants me to go on The View to apologize. Don't do that, you shouldn't do that. I don't feel I have to. I don't think what I did was so wrong. I just made it how I wanted it to be. What about you? You think I'm a horrible person? Yes, I do.

Well, I was kind of a writer, but I can't really write, but I did come up with a good story. And? Mm-hmm, yep. And, um, and I'm a prick and a liar, and I deserve everything that befell me. Everything that, um, I deserve everything that happened to me. Befell is overwritten. Holy shit. Holy shit. I'm in fucking rehab and you're gonna drive me back to drink. I don't drive. Ah, fucking brilliant, Andrea, New Yorker worthy. Oh, but wait, it didn't come out of my mouth, so why would you bother using it? Oh, you don't like the article? What are you talking about? No, I loved it. I love having my life spread across the fucking page for the world to read. You did it yourself. I did it to myself? Are you fucking kidding me? This isn't even writing. You made me do things to you so you'd have something to write about again. You realize that? I didn't make you do anything. Except that I'm fucking here, I'm here, I'm here, but it's fiction? Yes, it's fiction. It's my fiction. It's from my pen to my paper. It's mine as soon as it hits the page. But you're describing me. You're describing my cock, and what I like to drink. You're writing about how I am in bed. So what? So what? I wish I'd never met you. I could have put it anywhere. I could have had anyone. It's just filling holes. Those fucks we had were not worth it. They were for me. Yeah? Well, you're a fucking vampire! Crack, right? Fuck you. Fuck you! Fuck you in the ass with my titties! Fuck you! Fuck you in the ass with my titties! Hello. - Hi, Andrea? - Yeah. Just checking in to see how things are healing. Who is this? This is the Animal Surgical and Veterinary Hospital. Oh, hi, hi. Yeah, I can't get him to stop licking the wound. If he keeps licking the wound, it isn't gonna heal properly, so you have to cover it, but not with a bandage. So then, with what then? A t-shirt. A t-shirt? Look at all the different elephants, seven, eight. The holographic one. With the massive trunk coming through. So what massive, massive, massive 3D trunk. What's the name of that week long intensive driving course that you wanted me to take? ♪ Shiny happy people holding ♪ Shiny happy people holding ♪ Shiny happy people laughing Why are you going to him when you just sent him away? Because I made a really, really bad mistake. Maybe, but you're 23. You're allowed to get it wrong. And you can tell him that. Thanks. You're welcome. Um... All right, I'll carry it for you. And this right here. There you go. You should check your mirrors, make sure they're all in place. Oh, look, look, you're not gonna get too far with these on, though. I get that from the start. Oh, okay. I shouldn't have shouted like that. My throat still hurts. I finally had the guts to re-read what you wrote about us and this time it made me want to die 52% less. I felt the writing was great. Haiku for Perry. Crystals are for snow and jewels. Not good in cats. Girls are better anyway. Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your hair. Or your ire. You can come up here to me. Okay, then. I got smacked in the face at the bus stop by a crackhead. Jesus Christ. Did they catch him? Was a her. And no, they didn't. It's the LAPD, do you think they care? Probably not. I care. Can I stay with you? Here? Um, yes. But your face is making me shy. It's making me shy too. Do you remember what you said the first night when we... None of that means anything to me. Can we just start again? Do you wanna drive us to breakfast? I can't drive without passenger who has a license. All right. Well, if neither of us are capable of driving, then I guess we're just gonna have to walk. ♪ This is a beautiful day ♪ It is a new day ♪ We are together ♪ We are unified, and all for the cause ♪ ♪ Because together, we got power ♪ ♪ Apart, we got power ♪ Today on this program, you will hear gospel ♪ ♪ And rhythm and blues and jazz ♪ ♪ All those are just labels ♪ We know that music is music ♪ Today on this program, you will hear gospel ♪ ♪ And rhythm and blues and jazz ♪ ♪ All those are just labels ♪ We know that music is music ♪ Gospel ♪ Gospel ♪ Gospel ♪ Gospel ♪ Gospel ♪ Come ♪ Together as one ♪ Come ♪ Together as one ♪ Come ♪ Together as one ♪ Come ♪ Together as one ♪ Come ♪ This is a beautiful day ♪ Together as one ♪ It is a new day ♪ Come ♪ This is a beautiful day ♪ Together as one ♪ It is a new day ♪ We are together ♪ Come ♪ We are together ♪ Together as one ♪ We are unified ♪ We are together ♪ Come ♪ Together as one ♪ Because together, we got power ♪ ♪ Apart, we got power ♪ Together as one ♪ We are together ♪ Come ♪ Together as one ♪ Today on this program, you will hear gospel ♪ ♪ And rhythm and blues and jazz ♪ ♪ All those are just labels ♪ Come ♪ We know that music is music ♪ Together as one ♪ Gospel ♪ Come ♪ Gospel ♪ Together as one ♪ Gospel ♪ Gospel ♪ We are together ♪ Come ♪ We are unified Subtitles by explosiveskull
