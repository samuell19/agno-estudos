You're doing fine. Just a little further. You're doing good, honey, just a little more. Fuck, this way. We're almost there, you can do it. I can't make it. You'll be okay, I promise. Honey, it's okay, honey. It's too late for spells. Burn the board! I can't leave you here! It's not about me anymore. Darling, speak to me. Darling! Darling, speak to me. No! No! Where's the board? I can't let you go yet. I can't. I'm sorry, my love. Stop! Baby, don't do this. Honey, this isn't you. Then you shouldn't have brought me back. Baby, no! Baby, no! No, honey, no! One bay leaf, please. Which one is that? Keep up. Come on, put your heart into it. What the hell does that mean? It means that you have to believe it, you know? Actually visualize it coursing through your veins. I suck at spells. I'm not a natural born witch, so... Yeah, but that doesn't even matter. Honestly, try again. Come on. Coursing. Holy shit! Nice! - See? - Holy shit! That's closer. We're going to have to start practicing in the cellar so I don't kill anyone. How on earth did you learn all this? Trial and error. Mainly error. Sounds safe. That's just part of it. Potion's done. Thank you. I guess Rory's going first. What's this one do? You'll see. Okay, I'm feeling it. Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh, thank you. Okay, what's next? Well, how about this one? Mm hmm, temporary immortality. Yeah, immortality does not keep you from seriously maiming yourself. So I'll just mix it with the regeneration potion. Are you sure? I mean, potion mixing's some pretty high level stuff. Like, you don't mix alcohol, you don't mix potions. Then you don't have to drink it. Well, fine. When you turn into a frog, don't say I didn't warn you. Oh! Well, as much as I'd love to see that, I gotta go. Okay. I'm got getting dinner with my parents. Oh, lame. I'm breaking the news to them tonight. Wait, what news? Sam and I are moving in together. What, oh, guys! Guys, that's awesome! Thanks. Let's hope my parents think so. Good luck, babe. Try not to frog yourself. Bye! Oh my gosh, Abby. I mean, I saw it coming, but I'm happy for you guys. Thanks. Don't you think that's kind of fast? No, it's practical. I mean, we're both going to the same school anyway. Wait, so you're not rooming with us anymore? Don't worry, I'm literally going to see you guys everywhere. Actually, I have some news too. I have decided that I am not going to go to college with you guys. Wait, what? Where are you going? Nowhere, I'm going to skip college and move to Colorado. Colorado. What the hell is in Colorado? Other witches. We're other witches. I don't know, I feel like there's not like a whole bunch of room to grow here. I can't believe this. Why are you guys springing this on me so suddenly? I get it. What? I get it. You wanna get out, explore, grow as a witch. Yeah, exactly. Why can't you explore here? Because people here think that we're Satanists. Amen. Well, shit. When do you leave? End of the summer. Well, then we'll just have to make this the best summer ever. I'll drink to that. Ooh! Are you seriously going to drink that? Come on. I have to learn potion mixing sooner or later. Abby, seriously, stop. It doesn't look right. Ribbit, ribbit. Okay, she's insane, she's insane. Watch this. Oh my gosh. - Oh my God, Abby. - See, I told you. That's crazy. What the heck, how do you not see? Abby? Abby, are you okay? Are you okay, are you okay? Oh my God. Oh my God, oh my God! I'm going to call 911. No, no, no, we can handle this. We can't handle this, okay? We can't, they'll know we're witches! I'm going to keep it vague, obviously. What do I do, Abby, what do I do? Abby, sit down, sit down. Yeah, my friend is not breathing. There's something wrong with her. Oh God! I don't know. Bring someone, please. Help me hold her down! Hurry! What do we do? I don't know, I don't know! I'm sorry, I don't know! I don't know what to do! Abby, Abby. Is she dead? Abby? No, no, don't touch her! What do we do, what do we do? Rory, tell me what to do, please, tell me what to do! I think we need to perform a peace spell. That will kill her, Rory! I know, but it will help her go in peace! No, we're waiting for the ambulance. We're waiting for the ambulance. - Jess. - And you're waiting, you're waiting for the ambulance, too! It's only going to get worse. You don't know that! She either continues to suffer or we help her die peacefully. How could you turn your back on her right now? I am not! I'm trying to help her! You're not helping her! She's been crying this whole time, and Sam walks up to make her feel better. He says, is anyone shamed here? And this was the first night that they had even met. So Abby is in the backseat bawling her eyes out and Jess, you know, as usual, is all pissed in the front. I decided to try to cast a love spell. A love spell? Well, yeah, I mean, we just googled best love spells and tried them all, and, unfortunately, love spells are not real, but, fortunately, she never even needed a love spell to begin with. Oh my gosh, y'all. I forgot to tell you guys about the time. Hey. Sam, oh my God. How you holding up? You know, not good, you? I'm so sorry. I really thought I was going to marry her one day. You were the love of her life, you know? I hope you know that. We're too young to be having this conversation. I know, I know, I know. So how many of her family members know? Other than her parents, none. Everyone thinks she swerved off the road. Got it. Hey, was she at peace when it happened? I am so sorry, you don't have to answer that. No, no, no. I just don't remember a whole lot. Like, you know, it all happened really fast. Yeah, I understand. - No, I'm so sorry. - Jess? I was just telling the story about the time that we tried to sneak into junior prom. Yeah, yeah, that was absolutely crazy. I am so sorry. Sorry, we're all coping differently, right? But anyway, Abby tries to climb up the fence. Abby? "As friends we gather, hearts are true." Without traffic? - See you, Jess. - See you. There you are. Where have you been? Here. You should've been there inside with Abby's family. How can you act like this? Act like what? You're in there making up stories and like laughing it up with Abby's family, when not only did you encourage her to drink that potion, but you tried to cast a peace spell on her and kill her. I don't want to get into this right now. Why not, huh? I don't wanna fight, Jess. Why not, I do. You have so much to say, say something. Say something, Rory! Don't you know that this is hard for me too, Jess? Of course I am putting on a show. And of course I feel like it's my fault. You saw her suffering. A peace spell made sense, and you know that! Yeah, it would have killed her. But it would've kept her from blowing up in our faces! Hey, hey, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, come here. It's like it's not real. It feels like she's not even gone, you know? Definitely. Jess. Abby? Jess. Abby? Abby? Oh my God. Jess. What? All right, if we cut through the woods, the graveyard should be that way. What if someone sees us? I'm not as good as Abby, but these invisibility potions should last us about a minute each. Is it safe? It's the safest one in the book. You think this is going to work? I don't really know, I'm just here for Jess. Jess said Abby told her to do this. We'll see. Hey, do you not believe her? I mean, does it even matter? As long as she gets the closure she needs, I'm good. Okay, I don't need closure. I wanna speak to Abby. Well, I hope you're not disappointed. All clear. Wow. I don't like the energy here. Of course not, it's a graveyard Let's get set up. How does it open? I don't know. You brought us all the way out here and you don't even know how to open it? Yeah, but it says "it opens where I rest." "As friends we gather, hearts are true." What does that mean? That's what you say when you start a Ouija board session. As friends we gather, hearts are true, spirits near, we call to you. Whoa. Abby's been trying to speak to us. This is the only way we can hear her. Everyone. It's okay, it's just Abby. You are aware that you're not supposed to use a Ouija board in a graveyard? Yeah, but Abby wouldn't have brought us here unless this was the right thing. As we friends we gather, hearts are true, spirits near, we call to you. Abby, are you here with us? Oh my God. I knew it, I knew it. Abby, are you okay? Abby, slow down. No, I got it, I got it. What's she saying? Use the board to cast a spell. What spell do you want us to cast? I don't know that spell. Please. What do you think? I think we should cast it. Help, please help, please help. Guys, you have to cast it. Okay, Abby, we're trusting you. Did it work? Abby, can you hear us? Abby, honey, please, answer me. Hey, what the hell are you kids doing out here? Invisibility potions, now. This is private property! What the hell are you doing? Get back here! Get back here! Get back! Oh shit, I forgot the board! Get back! We don't have time. Go, go, go, go, go! Hey, hey, hey! Damn it! We have to go back. You're insane. No, we need that board if we're going to keep talking to Abby. The cop probably took the board. Can we at least go back and check in the morning? You can check in the morning. I am done messing with this. We have to keep going, we spoke to Abby. We used a Ouija board in a graveyard. Yeah, we talked to somebody, but it probably wasn't Abby! What the hell are you talking about? You know, Rory, why is it that every step of the way you always find ways to back out, put me down or fuck everyone over? Me? Jess, the only reason I even went back there was to help you get closure. We have no evidence whatsoever that we had any kind of contact with Abby. - You are not... - That's enough! I'm sorry, okay? I'm just a little freaked out about what happened back there. Do you really feel that way about me? Oh my God, I said enough. Jesus Christ, this isn't about either of you. This is about Abby. You know, with all due respect, you're not the one who saw your best friend explode. I'm sorry, you saw what? Sam, I... No, no, no, you told me you didn't see anything. You said she choked and she passed out. You lied to him? What was I supposed to tell him? Abby Long. More like Abby long gone. Is anybody here? Where are my friends? What? Oh my God! Sam. Abby. Open up, please. Talk to me. Let me out! Abby, please, open up. Abby, help me. What the hell? Oh my God. Abby, are you here? Abby, are you okay? I love you, too. Abby, were you at peace when you died? Abby, please, don't leave me right now. Talk to me, please. As friends we gather, hearts are true, spirits near, I call to you. Abby! Sam. Abby? Abby, I'm here. I'm doing this for you. Doing what? Doing what? Oh, no. Hey, I was just thinking about you. Hey, sis. What's up. I just had a question. Am I bad person? Where the hell is that coming from? Just answer the question. Of course not. You're empathetic, you're kind. You'd take a bullet for any of us. If you're a bad person, I'm Charles Manson. Why do you ask, did Mom say something stupid? No, I mean, yes, but that's not what I'm worried about right now. How are you holding up? I heard about the funeral. I'm sorry I wasn't there. Open up! I have to go. What was that? Is everything okay? Yeah, everything, 100%. I love you so much, bye. Come on, open up! Look what I found in my apartment. - Whoa. - Yeah. I used it to talk to Abby and she said... Wait, wait, wait, you're never supposed to play with a Ouija board alone. Okay, I don't know the rules about being a witch. You're not supposed to use one in the graveyard, either. Okay, okay, what did she say? She told me that in order to come back to life, she needs to perform a sacrifice on you or Rory, and I couldn't get ahold of either of you guys... Oh my God, we have to go, now. Rory. Oh God, help! No, help! Abby? Rory, dear. Abby, what's going on. Drink this. What is it? Abby, what are you doing to me? Don't make this harder than it has to be. Help! Someone! The Ouija board you used to resurrect me, it's been passed down in my family for generations. I really don't like being back here. Are you sure she's going to be here? I'm positive, this is our only hiding spot. We do everything here. Rory! Rory! My great, great grandmother died when she was 15. Her mother was also a witch, used the board to cast an ancient spell. But when she came back, something wasn't right. She was in a temporary body, a powerful, demonic body. She was stuck between life and death because isn't a spell. It's a trade with the spirit of the board. A life for a life, a sacrifice. I can't find her. No, she has to be here. This is the only place she'd go. Okay, okay, we don't have time. We have to go check her house. You haven't checked her house? You told me she would be here. I went to you first... We have to go, we have to go. Take it. It'll make the pain go away. I was grateful you tried to put a peace spell on me. Why sacrifice me? Abby, I am your best friend! I know you're in there, Abby! Because I have to kill someone who witnessed my death. It's part of the exchange. I have to come back, I have to be with Sam. But why me, why not Jess? Because Jess wouldn't ask a question like that. Where's the board? It was right here in the front seat. Oh, no, no. Just look around, it can't have gone far. Jess, I hear Rory. Rory! I don't want this to hurt. Let me help you. Abby, please, don't do this. Do you want the potion? It came from here. Be careful. There you go. Jess! Rory. Hurry! All right, come on, come on. Come on, I got her, let's go. Jess. Come on, stay with me. Breathe, breathe. Let's go. Rory, Rory, talk to me, are you okay? That potion she gave me. Run! We have to go! We have to go now! Abby, stop! Sam. My love, I'm doing this for you, so I can come back and we can be together. I can't be with you if it means one of them dying. You don't mean that. I mean it. - Shit. - Death has perverted your mind and poisoned your soul. Sam, I love you. I love you, too, but we can't do this. Sam, please don't do this to me. I've made my decision. Can I hold you one last time? Jess, get in the car. What happened to Sam? Sam! Rory, what happened? She deflected my death spell. He's gone. What? Go. Sam. Holy shit, what do we do? Rory? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, do not fall asleep. You don't know what the potion will do. Wake up! Rory, snap out of it, Rory, come on! The porch, we can't let her go. Come back to me, my love. As friends we gather, hearts are true, spirits near, I call to you. Two people witnessed your death. We can do this. Shit. Screw it! Holy fuck! What the fuck was that? Oh my God, Rory. What did you just use? You should've used. I couldn't do that, so I just gave you a little zap. A little zap, you could've killed me. The potion was killing you, Rory. It was a rest potion! How was I supposed to know that, Rory? Whoa, whoa, go, go! Was that Sam? I don't know, I don't know! Oh my God, somebody's up there! Sam! Oh my God! Oh my God! - Oh my God. - What do we do? I don't know! Those that mourn, those that mourn, all that die shall be reborn. Those that mourn, those that mourn, all that die shall be reborn. Shit, fuck. - Where did he go? - What do we do? We're going to have to hold our own. No, we can't, our spells weren't working. She deflected my death spell, so clearly that means something. Where is he? We have to go, now. Doris, Doris, are you still out here? Doris, oh my God, honey, honey! What happened, my baby? What happened to you? Oh, Doris! Our daughter was murdered. We don't know what to do. We're overcome with grief. I can't take it anymore. Do you seek peace for yourself or do you seek peace for the deceased? Can't we have both? I wish, my friend. There's only so much I could do, should you be willing to accept the risk. I'll do anything for my daughter. I just want her back. This should do it. Do you know what this is? No. This is a spirit board. They've been used for over 800 years. There are two rules with spirit boards. Never play alone, and never play in a graveyard. This is because a spirit board isn't just a board. It lives and breathes like you and me. It's alive with the power of the spirit. If you break those rules, things can get dangerous. I don't understand what to do with it. I want you to break those rules, tap into the power of the board and its ability to resurrect. That can't be safe. If you want your child back, then that is the price. Jess, you're up! Rory. Are you okay? Yeah, I just had this vivid dream. It was like a vision... Of the future? No, no, no, of the past, and it was about the book. There it was again. It was a vision of the same people. Holy shit. What? - Holy shit! - What? - Oh my God! - What? - Oh my God! - Rory, what, what? Jess, no wonder you're so shitty at casting spells! You said I was getting better at casting spells. Jess, Jess, Jess, Jess, you're not a witch! Rory, what? You are a psychic! Oh my God, I'm so jealous! Wait, I was seeing the past. Maybe. Maybe something important happened here. Oh my God, try again, go, go, go. Okay, okay. Death lives. It happened again. Sick, man, I knew you couldn't suck that bad. - Rory. - Yeah? Something awful happened here. How did I not know I was psychic? I mean, I guess what happened with Abby kind of awoke your abilities, and that's probably why you even could hear her in the first place. Come here. Actually, let me show you something. Okay. So psychics have their own spells, which is so cool, but most of them are based around. Yeah. Good, deep diaphragmatic breathing. Now, envision the object in your head, and imagine lifting it with the tips of your fingers. Light as a feather. Anything? Don't focus on me, focus on the bag. Oh my God, Jess! I did it! You did it! I can't believe it! Neither can I! I think we have a fighting chance against them now. Yeah. These new visions that you're having, to me, it seems like there's another spirit trying to communicate with you. Well, how do we talk back? A Ouija board? Well, we don't have that. Unless. As friends we gather, hearts are true, spirits near, we call to you. Is anybody with us? Listen carefully, burn the board. Did you hear that? Hear what? T, U, R, N, A. Turn around? What do you see? Who are you? Someone who understands. Your daughter, you brought her back with the board. And it was terrible. Please, listen carefully, burn the board. It's the only way to send her back. We have to burn the board, but how the hell are we going to do that? I got an idea. An invisibility potion, and not a very good one. How many seconds? At best 15. 15? Hey, we're lucky we have that long. Okay. They're probably hiding out in the cellar of the barn. They don't seem to be very keen on daylight. Rory, we need to get help. Oh yeah, and just expose the rest of the world to witchcraft and have us burned at the stake again? Yeah. Here. - Wait me. - Yeah. I'll distract them with magic. We got ourselves into this mess, and, goddamn it, we're going to get ourselves out of it. How much longer until nightfall? No more than an hour. - Ready? - Yeah. Two, three. See who it is. It's them. Abby help me! I can't do this alone. I see you. Sam, grab her! Who? I see her. Jess! Do something! I can't, I'll hit you! - No, Sam! - No, please. Don't you dare cast a fucking peace spell on me. Sam! Sam. Jess is dead. You did well, my love. I'll be right behind you. Rory, Rory, you did it, you did it, you did it. Come here, come here. Yeah, yeah. It's a beautiful spell. - You know it? - Yeah, it's a healing spell. It's a transfer spell. You give your life force over to someone else. Rory, no, no, Rory, no. I couldn't let him kill you. Don't go, I need you, I need your help. I need you. I'm sorry, I could've save her. Who, who? Abby. Oh God! Abby! Rory, no, no. Abby? What, no, no, no, no, what is happening? Abby? Sam, my love. Sam. Sam! You were the only one who saw him die, and he didn't kill you himself. And now he's dead. Mom! Burn the board, for her sake. I can't, it's still Abby. No, it's the spirit of the board controlling her. Burn the board. It's what she would want. As friends we gather, hearts are true, spirits near, I call to you. Come on, come on. Woo! Okay. Come on, come on! Okay. As friends we gather, hearts are true, spirits near, I call to you. Where's the board? We must go to great lengths to protect this board. We must use all of our strength. She is truly a threat. We cannot afford to lose. No. We cannot risk eternal damnation. I was kind of enjoying being dead. What do you need? I can't believe I finally cast something. I told you psychics have their own set of spells. What's this one do? Are we alive? Not quite. Well, at least I can still cast spells. According to this, your temporary bodies aren't very strong like Abby's. You're a psychic projection, so, if you get hit, you're gone. I can't bring you back. I barely had enough strength to bring you back the first time. Now we just wait for the board to come to us. I don't think we have to wait very long. Go, I'll handle this. Remember what we talked about. Jess, I know you're here, come out! Jess, I know you're here. Here, this will cover you. Abby. Sam. You're back. I am. I had to find a way to be with you. I love you. I love you, too. I can't lose you again. I know how we can be together forever. How? Where's the board? What do I do? Let me see it. You know I can't do that. Just tell me what I need to do. What the hell is he doing? Just grab the board and throw it in the fire. Burn the board. What? Abby, Abby, I know you're in there. Burn the board, and let your spirit rest with mine. You're doing the right thing. No. Just stay here. Jess, the board! No! Charge! Get off! Abby, it's not too late. It's not too late for me, either. Rory, fight! Rory! Stop! I have to be the one that kills her. Abby, no, no, no. Take me back! Temporary immortality. Yeah, I'm okay, I promise. How can you be okay? That attack should've killed you. Mom said the doctors couldn't believe it. I'm coming this Saturday, whether you like it or not. No, I'm fine. It sounds a lot worse than it is. I don't know. Being mugged and stabbed sounds pretty bad. Other than that, how are you holding up? How are things? Honestly, I'm a lot better now. I've really come to peace about what happened to Abby. Good, I'm so glad you're feeling better. Jess. Hey, I gotta go, Mom's at the door. All right, I'll see you both Saturday. Bye. Abby? I want to thank you for burning the board. I'm so sorry for what I did to you. That's the recipe for the restoration potion. As long as you don't mix it with something else, it'll help. Ask me how I know. Actually, I think I'll pass. Why is that? Sometimes you gotta tough it out. Not us. Not witches. You can't cheat life, no matter who you are. Hey, what the hell are you doing? What are you, a bunch of witches resurrecting your dead redhead friend so she can come back and kill me?
