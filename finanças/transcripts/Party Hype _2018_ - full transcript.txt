[DUBSTEP MUSIC PLAYING] Cool, man. I'm not even tripping off that. It's the whole setup they got going down there. Nightclubs do whatever they want. Man, we were waiting in that line for like an hour. They just kept grabbing random THOTs and pulling them to the front of the line like we don't even exist. OK. So if you're running a club, are you gonna have all the ugly, sweaty dudes making all of the girls uncomfortable? Or are you gonna have the most beautiful women picked from the line, packed in one room? You're right. Yeah. It's all about the ratio, man. You're right. You're right. It's just, I hate feeling like I'm at the bottom of the totem pole, you know? You're a trip, man. I'm never standing in that line again. (LAUGHING) Dude, no way, man. The new professor's gonna be pissed. We need a film with some substance. I'm not a film major so that I can make practical films. I make films so that I can tell stories, OK? So let's focus on the action first, and then we can bring in the swordsman, all right? Open on a knight riding in, decked out in a suit of glowing silver armor, eh? And then on his horse, he's waving his country's flag. OK, Tarantino, so where we gonna get a horse? I've got some hillbilly cousins out east. Oh, cool, cool. OK. What about, um, the glowing armor and the waving flag? You know, I go to the movies to see something extraordinary, not some shit that I could do at home. Well, maybe if your broke ass made some extraordinary money, then maybe we could fund some of your bullshit ideas. I've already figured out a way for us to make some cash this summer. Now, that's what I want to hear. So there's this big party coming up. Dude, no, no, no, no. Hell no. I told you, I'm not gonna be a stripper. Not the stripper idea this time, OK? Your nipples are way too small, anyway. They're like Raisinets. It would never work. It wouldn't work. Yo, stop talking about my nipples. I shot the-- the host of the party a DM, though, and he's totally down for us to film it. Shit. How much? $100. That's it? That's $100 more than we have right now, isn't it? Look, aren't your parents paying your rent? No. Actually, student loans are. See, this is why we need this money, OK? This could lead to more parties and more money. What kind of parties? House party? [RECORD SKIPPING] [CLUB MUSIC PLAYING] I'm the life of the party, taking shots of Bacardi. Shawty acting naughty. Jello shots off her body. Life of the party, taking shots of Bacardi. Shawty acting naughty. Jello shots off her body. Shawty acting naughty. Jello shots off her body. The life of the party. I'm the life of the party. Life of the party. I'm the life of the party. So how'd you feel about that jello wrestling? Oh my god, that was amazing. You should have been there. Yes, you watching this video, you should have been there. It was epic. It was epic. It was epic. Were you there? I was there. He was there, ladies and gentlemen. He was there. Cut. [MUZAK PLAYING] (LAUGHING) Yo, we can't post this. What? We can't post this! I don't think you realize what this is gonna do for us. Yeah, I don't think you realize what this could do to us. You want more views and followers on social media, right? This is how. We have footage, Cody, of a hundred misdemeanors. Not everyone there was over 21. I don't care. Any press is good press. This could put us on the map as videographers, bro. I don't think you realize how much attention this is gonna bring. You know you want this. Let me think. More views, more money, more t-- Yeah, shut up. Let me think. Let me see the footage. Do you remember the chick with the jelly beans, man? She, like-- I don't know how she got that whole bag-- I got it. You got it? I got it. I'll blur their faces. Their identities are safe. Our asses are covered. Full recognition. Yo, but, uh, let me talk to Kay first. What? I want to talk to Kay first. Aren't y'all on a break? And? We already filmed the video. How is that even gonna go? You know? What are you gonna say? "Uh, look, Kay, I know we're on a break, but I filmed this party video with a bunch of drunk hot chicks. And I'm wondering if it's OK if I post it." I'll handle it. I got Kay wrapped around my finger. It's nothing. Kay, I just filmed this party, and there was a whole bunch of girls that were half naked. There was a lot of drinking. There was fraternities, sororities, all these people there, and everyone was having a good time. And I just didn't-- I just-- Jay, it's fine. It's fine. Are you sure? Because it was a wild party. And you know I didn't do anything. I didn't do nothing. I told them, look, I'm talking to this girl right now. I was just there to work to make money-- Look, whatever it is, you're single. You can do whatever you want. I just didn't want to mess up anything between us, you know? Jay, that's sweet of you. It really is. But when I said that I needed a break, I meant it. I'm trying to find out who I am as a person. I'm trying. I'm trying to have fun. I'm-- I'm going to these parties and things, but it's-- I just want to be here with you, Kay. Jay, I-- Do you remember that time, the first time you came over? Like, we were just hanging out, watching movies, eating popcorn like we were in middle school again? We were so nervous, just sitting there, hands shaking. Kay, I think you need more toilet paper. Who's your friend? Howdy. [SCREAMING] Stop! That's enough! [SCREAMING] Would you stop screaming? Man, shut up! Get in the room. We broke up for that? That's who you put over me? I don't know. No. No, you do know. No, and I want to hear it from you. Not one of your social media pages or one of your Insta model girlfriends-- Fine. First of all, he was around. I'm in school-- Let me finish! First of all, he was around. Second of all, he has money to take me places and show me things. I want to go places, Jay. I want to see things. I want to go places and be seen. Movies and chill? It's fun for a little while. Third, he has a real job, not some unreachable dream. So that's all I am to you, huh? Broke guy with dreams. It's sweet. It really is. We need more people like you in the world. But dreams don't pay the rent, baby. Did you sleep with him? Jay. Did you sleep with him? I am sorry. No, you're not. Because if you're sorry, you would have told me. I was going to tell you. When? Before or after he was done taking a shit? [GRUNTING] Ohh. Oh, god! Bro, you just made me die! I will burn your house down with all of your children in it. And I'll make-- I'll make your dog watch. And then I'll adopt it. I'm gonna cut your family up in nice, delicious squares. I will cook you into a beautiful bolognese sauce with-- with some cheese and shit. And oh, goddamn, it will be so good. It'll be so good in my belly! I'll eat your life force, bitch. [CHILL MUSIC PLAYING] Gordo presents. Done. You finished? Dropped the video. My boy. Let's go. Holy shit, a 72? We went over this like two days before. What happened? I don't know. Were you in a bad mood? No. Did you try to cheat? Off of who? Are you still dating that squatty douche bag, third-string running back with the "my stepdad put cigarettes out on my arm" busted pick-up truck? Wow. And no, it's not because of him. Then what happened? I just don't care anymore. I already got into the school I wanted, and I'm exhausted. You haven't even taken your SATs yet. What school would even accept-- you picked a school without even telling me? Well, it's in Denver. You're going all the way out to Denver? Because weed is legal? Wait. Have you tried week? That's why I didn't tell you. No, I haven't. Potheads are just cooler people, you know? Oh my god. The ones in my school are nonjudgemental, free-thinking, and pretty liberal. Everyone else in my school is closed-minded, pretentious, and slightly racist. You've seen them. You know, if you'd have used the word pretentious on this shit essay, you might've gotten a B. Are you even listening? Yeah, yeah. All your friends are assholes. They are. So what? That-- that's how you're gonna decide your place in the world? That's-- your big decision comes off of that? You can't judge the whole world based off of your little private school. What else do I have to judge the world off of? Gah! You know, I wish I could just give you everything I know so you can just skip past all the bullshit. What's the fun in that? I hate you. Did I tell you that I was thinking about joining a sorority? I quit. Katie. Yeah, it's not bad. You just want to make sure you don't restate the pro-- the thesis. You-- Katie, I've been calling you. Mom, I'm trying to study. Did you empty the dishwasher? Oops. After we knock this out, I'll make sure she takes care of it. Thank you. I'm glad you're in town this summer. No problem. I'm just here because the volunteer hours look good on my resume. Hey. Pick up. Pick up. Pick up. Jay, what's going on, man? It's me. It's DJ Tricky Fresh. Pull the video. We got an emergency. Pull it. Destroy it. Delete it. Whatever you gotta do. Burn it. Get back to me as soon as you can, all right, man? Pick up your phone. Dude, 2,500 views and still climbing. Oh my g-- This is insane, bro. I told you that this would put us on the map. Plus, if you get a call, though, from-- from DJ Shitty Chest or whatever his name is, don't-- don't worry about it. I'll handle it. Oh, relax. Their faces are blurred. Everything is fine. No! That was a bullshit fix. The cops busted the event. They took a few people to jail. They wrote tickets. They knew that there were minors drinking. They are old enough to make their own decisions. So screw 'em. It doesn't work that way, Cody. We provided them with alcohol. That's a class D misdemeanor with a maximum sentence of 364 days in jail and $2 million in fines. I don't know about you, but I'm not trying to go to jail and then have to get jumped into a gang that I had to join to get protection. And then have to shank some Mexican to prove my worth. I ain't even racist. I love tacos. Then, one day, when I'm showering all alone by myself, I have to get jumped by the Mexican gang that the guy I shanked was in. And then I get passed around like a Panama Blue City blunt! What? Uh, OK. First, we didn't provide any of that. You did. And second, I think you watch too much TV. Listen to the best. I'm DJ Tricky Fresh. Pull the damn video. OK, fine. Fine. We'll pull the video. I don't want to get in trouble. We're not pulling the video. What if this shit falls back on us. No, they already have the ringleader, DJ Shitty Chest or whatever. And what would they even do? What would they even arrest us for? Plus, the cops have more important things to handle. They'll gun down or whatever it is they do. Not all cops are bad. And not all crimes are worth following up on. So let's just accept what's fallen into our laps. And what's that? Attention, reputation, and momentum. People are already texting me about our next event. Too bad we lost our only contact. Well, I've been on the phones all morning. I found someone who's interested. Have you ever heard of the bar called the Fuzzy Love? No. And I'm not working for a place called the Fuzzy Love. Ugh. I'm looking for one video a week for our Thursday night college nights. I really want it to capture the environment. Moldy walls and the smell of piss? Now, focus on the girls the most. You know, girls and drinks. The younger the girls, the better. How much money are you looking to get rid of? Well, how much money are you trying to make? $300. Eh, $150. $275 and we'll throw in some special effects. Oh, $200. Bullshit! $250. Look, man, it's one video a week. I know you can do that. I can't do that. You can't do that? Can't do it. Come on, Al. Al, after all we've been through. Come on, buddy. Come on. Work with me here, man. Look-- look, let's be honest. All cards on the table, all bullshit aside, the reason you called us here is because you don't want to shell out $1,000 to some filmmaker who showed you his production reel of slo-mo shots of the city with sad-ass, sappy music playing in the background with his non-accredited film degree from some local ass college while he runs his production company out of his mother's apartment. All I'm asking for is $250 a week. And we'll have a turnaround rate of 48 hours. $225 a video, and I'll play your videos through our TV monitors in the club throughout the week. Eh? Eh? Deal. [LAUGHS] All right! See you animals next week. And remember to put as many girls in the videos as you can. Girls and drinks. [DANCE MUSIC PLAYING] Shawty acting naughty. Jello shots off her body. The life of the party. I'm the life of the party. Life of the party. I'm the life of the party. Go nuts! [CHEERING] You guys enjoying the party? Yeah! Yes! It's awesome! It's awesome. You guys come out here a lot? Yeah, all the time. All the time. Every Thursday night. Jello wrestling is going down tonight. I hope you guys are ready for this. I want to see somebody get slammed, personally. I can't wait. It's going down. [RAP MUSIC PLAYING] Taking shots of Ciroc all around the clock. A party ain't a party unless my people in the spot. Nigga power. Nigga power. Money falling from the ceiling. [MUZAK PLAYING] Dude, don't you see how everyone looks at us with that thing? It makes us look like amateurs. We are amateurs. Yeah, but everybody doesn't need to know that. That thing sucks. Watch it. And don't talk about Judith like that. Judith? Really? Yeah, it fits. That's the problem. We need a camera that says something like-- like Leonidas or something. Yeah. Or Apocalypse. Exactly. That way, we can have more clients-- Or the Leviathan. Yeah, that's perfect. So we-- Or Mephistopheles. Cody! Sorry. I smoked a little bit right before we left. We need the camera to be able to do more of this and less of this. Ow. OK. We have more shutter options, more light exposure, lower aperture settings. OK, fine. Let's get that. But can we do it tomorrow? I got a chick that needs my attention. [RAP MUSIC PLAYING] Yeah. Ones, 10s, 20s, 50s, 100s. Yeah. Baby girl-- if you got some K, then you better make it shake. If you-- if you got some K, then you better make it shake. Hey, if you got some K, then you better make it shake. Little money in the bank bout to make me break the bank. If you got some K, then you better make it shake. If you-- if you got some K, then you better make it shake. Hey. [GIGGLING] Stop being a little bitch. Texas standoff. Uh, what's that? First person who takes three shots and chugs a beer wins. And all you have to say is "Texas standoff" to initiate the duel. That's ridiculous. Hm. Is the stripper scared? Uh, first of all, I am a go-go dancer. Second of all, which is not-- A go-go dancer? You know those girls inside? Uh-huh. They get all dressed up, and they go to the club, and they dance for free? I get paid to do it. Damn. I basically get paid to work out at a club. I got an idea. Huh? Mhm. Whoever wins-- whoever loses, I mean-- whoever loses has to strip down to their underwear, run around the pool, and jump in. Deal? Deal. Texas standoff. Texas standoff. [MUSIC PLAYING] You sold out, chasing money anywhere, any time of day. Blood on your hands in the mirror-- No way. Take it off. (CHANTING) Take it off. Take it off. Take it off. [CHEERS] Enjoy. [RAP MUSIC PLAYING] If you got some K, then you better make it shake. If you-- if you got some K, then you better make it shake. Hey, if you got some K, then you better make it shake. Little money in the bank bout to make-- [BIRDS CHIRPING] Hey, yo, check this out. Brand new camera just came in. Oh, hell yeah. Does that have the low light shit that you wanted? Game changer. Did you get Al's voicemail? Yeah, man. I don't know what the hell we're gonna do. You need to trust me more. I told you I can handle lining up potential clients. Plus, we knew he wasn't gonna need our videos forever. And he's still gonna play them. I have someone that we can sit down with, you know. And we should sit down with them. Plus, it's summer, so there's still plenty of options. My team and I saw your little videos. They're cute. But I think if you work for us, we can take you guys to the next level. Yeah, we saw your little promotional videos. We can upgrade that shaky cell phone quality. What's your guys' name? Party Hype Film Krew. Party Hype Film Krew? That's a mouthful. Wait. Wait. Wait. Let me guess. The two of you spell "crew" with a K. [CHUCKLING] OK. Wait. Let me get this straight. A local club promoter is telling us how to be more marketable to a larger audience? We don't just promote clubs. Squad X dominates the scene. We monopolize the game, baby. I got club promoters on every single campus surrounding downtown. We send party buses out, and they bring them back to the club. Now, if the two of you could put your egos aside for a second, you'd be smart enough to see the sweet deal I'm about to offer you. All right, all right. How much money we talking? I don't know. I'm talking to a couple of other film crews, so why don't we say $125? Hoo. Yeah, I was thinking more in the ballpark of about $300. Yeah, we got a brand new camera, some new equipment, and that covers editing as well. You think this is a negotiation? $125. Think of it as a trial run. [RAP MUSIC PLAYING] Shawty hit my line, but my phone ain't never ring. A goddamn trail run? No, screw that shit, man. Relax, man. What's your deal? They're talking about camera crews. What camera crews? We are the camera crew. Relax, dude. What, do you want to work for an egotistical maniac? I'm already working for one. Whatever, man. Listen. Listen! Let's just kill the video like we always do. We'll get in with this crew. We'll get paid to make videos every week. And they promote two clubs each week. That's more money for us. Yeah, if they decide to pay us. He'll pay. They just have to break us in a little bit. What are we, dogs? Just play the game for a little bit. Like you said, just use them until we find the next step in the ladder. You're right. You're right. Plus, it'll be fun as shit. Nightclubs, chicks, drinks. We're moving up. [POP MUSIC PLAYING] (SINGING) So close, but so far away. I'm running out of reasons to ask you to stay. Your mind changes like the seasons, leaving me out in the cold, feeling so-- feeling so alone. I'm waiting for you to come around again. I can't wait forever. I'm waiting. I want you so bad. But I can't wait forever. I can't wait forever. [CHILL MUSIC PLAYING] Gordo presents. Look, man, you don't get to just make extreme decisions like that. Extreme decisions? I know that filming is easy for you and all nonchalant. But marketing is a serious business. The look of our company matters on every single piece of content that we put out. Oh, I'm sorry. What part of this video misrepresents what you do for a living? It's not just that. Our team has an order. There's a structure, a chain of command, checks and balances. Dude, it's a video about partying. That's it. Relax. Look, you film the video. You edit it. You send it to me. I'll watch it, and then I'll check off on it. I get to decide when we post the video. You don't get to post whatever you want. Dude, have you seen social media? Everyone loves it. You're the only one that's bitching about it. Then I'm the only one that runs this business. You got a problem with that? Why don't you go back to filming some run-down, shitty-ass bar? Look, hold on. Wait. Just wait. This is stupid. I don't want to argue, and I don't want to yell at you. Look, dropping a video is all about key timing, OK? What if we have an event coming up? We've got to hype that up. We've got to capitalize on a post. It's all about the timing, OK? Let's just pull the video down, and we'll fix it. I mean, come on. There's some pacing issues in that video. Some of the shots are a little slow, and I need that to be fast. Let's work on it together. We can fix it, put it back up, and then on the next video, we can work on it together and knock that out. Come on, man. Let's get back to work and have some fun. [DUBSTEP MUSIC PLAYING] Party Hype Film Krew. This is how we party, bro. [DUBSTEP MUSIC PLAYING] It's the same shit every single time we go out. Do you realize that? It's called being nice, OK? Not everyone's an angry, stone-faced asshole. Nice? Is that what you call it? Complaining about your life to every guy you see like it's so bad. You go to a PWI. And you're basically the queen of your little sorority. Really? Who are you to judge me? Screw you. Oh, yeah, and laughing at every guy's joke like it's so funny. "Ha, ha, that's what she said. Good one, Chad." Don't blame me for your own insecurities, OK? Insecurities? I call it being aware. Mean mugging every guy I introduce you to is insecure. Getting angry at me for not posting pictures of us on my social media? That's insecure. Hitting up my ex, asking him why we broke up? That is so insecure. Yeah, well, maybe if I could trust you, I wouldn't have to do shit like that, you know? Because you entertain every single guy you come across, showing me stupid shit on your phone like, "Hey, babe, look at this picture this guy sent me. Oh my god, he won't stop texting me." How did he get your number in the first place? That's the type of shit that I'm talking about. You're the one to talk, you know. You have girls hanging off you all the time. And I push them off! What about Lauren? Hitting you up at 2:00 in the morning? What is that about? What in the world gave her the confidence to call you at 2:00 in the morning? I explained that. You can't even explain the short, little midget frat guy we saw tonight. Oh god. I'm an extrovert, OK? I'm a free spirit. And you know what? That was what you said you used to love about me. Yeah, well, maybe I made a mistake. A mistake? Yeah, you know what? I made a mistake, too. I kissed my ex while you were looking for me in the bathroom. And you want to know what? Maybe it was the best thing that's happened to me in the past month. Whoa, wait. Bella, sweetie, wait. Hold on. You're too drunk to drive. Bella, come back. Bella! He didn't mean it. God. Jay, are you gonna do something? She's too drunk to drive. Jay. Jay! I hope she crashes. Whoa, Mickey, Mickey. Mickey. Mickey, take it easy. Let the fuck go of me! We'll go find her. Let me go. Trust me. Just walk it off. Geez. Fucking prick. Friends with benefits. Yeah. When did we get so territorial and serious? I'm sorry. I don't know. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. He was my first. So we have a crazy history. And-- It's cool. But I meant what I said when I said that, you know, we just hook up until we find somebody we really want to be with. And, um-- It sounds, like, so easy to do, but I don't know. I think it's inevitable to get jealous when you're sharing your body with someone so often. You got jealous? I saw you on the dance floor with that big-tittied cocktail waitress, and I wanted to rip out her fake extensions. [LAUGHING] Ouch. I can't believe I was feeling that way. I think, um, we should just be friends. Yeah. Sounds good. It was fun, though. Yeah. Yeah, it was. I guess I'll, um-- I guess I'll see you around. [DOOR OPENING] [BIRDS CHIRPING] [DUBSTEP MUSIC PLAYING] Bitch. Check this crowd out. The line goes down the street. Look at over here. It's the party bomb. It's all over the place. I love it. I love it. Ladies all over the place, man. I know everybody's gonna have a blast tonight. Shit! If this damn thing would just go! Jay? What? I'm sorry? I'm sorry. Um, I just put the camera up. The photos and videos will be online later this week. Thank you. How many times do you have to say that per night? A lot. Jay, it's me, Dani. That crazy jello wrestling night, you interviewed me and some of my friends. I'm sorry. This is really embarrassing. It's been a rough night. But, um, how have you been? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's fine. Good, good. I'm just enjoying my summer before my school stuff starts back up. Ooh, don't remind me. Yeah. And school was like hell for me last semester. So I changed my major from health sciences to biomedical engineering. Holy shit. I mean, naturally, that's such a smooth transition. I know. I mean, I can see how that goes so well. No, it's just-- it's more fun for me. And then my family and I, like, this weekend are gonna take our annual family vacation thing to Aspen. So. You're going to Aspen? Yeah, have you been? No. No, I've-- I haven't left Texas. Well, wait, no. There was this one time me and my friends got really wasted and we went to that casino out in Oklahoma. But I mean-- I mean, I guess Aspen, that's cool, too. Yeah, but we should party when I get back. Yeah. Yeah. What's-- what's, um-- what's your cell? OK, 214-- 214-- Honestly, it's probably easier if I just-- Yeah, yeah. OK, wait. Let's take a selfie. Yeah, sure. Wait. I meant-- can I take another one in case I look ugly? Oh my god, you don't look ugly. No, stop. I have to. OK. #AngryVideoGuy. #You'veComeALongWay. Don't worry about it. Damn. Your job is to keep track of them. Look, I'm not gonna tell black people they can't come to the club. That's not what I'm saying. That's basically what you're saying, right? Look, if you don't want black people to come to the club, junk crank up the dress code. Stop letting them wear big shirts and basketball shoes. That's the bodyguard's job. Tell them to do a better job. That's your job. I saw the groups you brought in. If too many of them get in, it changes the vibe of the club. They start fights. People are afraid to come here. And we lose money. You lose money. Perception is reality. We need to maintain an upscale environment. By upscale, do you mean these insecure white girls with big, fake titties? Or they're rich-ass sugar daddies who are cheating on their wives? This is not a joke. I will not lose another club because of them. I will happily get rid of your little squad long before I let that happen. You probably lost your last club because you don't know how the world works. Those fake white girls with fake titties have fathers-- fathers who made their fortunes on the backs of my mother and father, who were paid just enough for us to still starve. Those are the bank accounts I want to bleed dry every night, as I sell their entitled sons and daughters fermented, overpriced poison. Things are never black or white, GO. I'm not a racist. I'm a capitalist. You know what? I'm gonna save you the trouble. I quit. My team ain't working for no racist, prejudiced piece of shit like you. Good luck. Oh, what now? We haven't been paid yet. You can get the pre-game tomorrow. We gotta count it first and pay our guys. How is that my problem? Get out of my way. I'm working. I'm sorry. Wait. Are you the videographer? Yeah. Awesome work, my friend. Thanks. I'm Alex. I own Club Life. I'm firing Squad X. So when you want to cut out the middleman, give me a call. I'll double whatever he's paying you. Matter of fact, can you send me a copy of the video you made tonight? Yeah. Ye-- yeah. Don't change anything. Make it exactly how you usually would. Bring that magic. Yeah. Yeah, man, totally. When will it be ready? 48. 48 hours, max. You work quick. I love it. We'll talk soon. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. [CHILL MUSIC PLAYING] Gordo presents. [BIRDS CHIRPING] Uh-oh. Is this guy bothering you? No, he's just-- No, don't worry, babe. I'll handle it. Wait. Hey, look, asshole, I don't know who you are, but-- oh my god! Please don't hurt me! Take my wallet! I don't want your money. Please don't hurt me. I love you people. Black lives matter. I voted for Obama. Basketball is my favorite sport. I-- please. Ah! I'm gonna call my dad, and he's gonna sue you. What kind of guy wears shorts that don't pass his knees? I'm old enough to date whoever I want, you know. How did you find me? I'm not here about that. Your mom told me where you were. What's wrong? Oh. Yeah. You didn't tell her, did you? No, I didn't tell her. She's got real shit to worry about. And I'm not a snitch. Look, don't smile at me. What the hell were you doing at a club? Celebrating my 18th birthday. Thanks for remembering, by the way. I've seen your friends. There's no way in hell they're over 17. How the hell did you get in? We sent Tony a fake. [FRUSTRATED GRUNTS] Oh my god, you're so young. You know what kind of people go to clubs? Look, people looking to hook up with people, OK? They're looking to take advantage of whoever is there, especially young girls that have no business being there, who are probably actually underage in the first place, all right? They're looking to take them to go do things and go places that you wouldn't normally go! And some people, like my friends and I, just go to dance. That's like 8% of the people that are there. The other 92% are people that are savages, animals looking to hook up with anything that has a pulse or breathes. What percentage are you in? Yeah. I've seen your videos. Party Hype Film Krew? You're lecturing me about being safe from predators? Yeah, you would know, right? That's different. How? Hey, you're not gonna make me feel guilty about this, OK? You're a kid in high school. I'm 21 and in college, OK? That doesn't even make sense. Whatever. Just leave me alone. Handle your own life. Katie. Katie! Shit! Blue shorts was your ride home, wasn't he? I just want to see you get to your next destination in life safely. I know. Look, just-- I'm sorry for being involved too much in your life. And, uh, just call me if you need anything or want me to handle anybody. I always do. And I didn't mean what I said earlier. I know you were looking out for me. Thank you. You're my get out of jail free card. Get out. You ruined it. Get out. Later. [RECORD SKIPPING] [PARTY MUSIC PLAYING] --but it's like 2:00 in the morning. I don't understand why we can't do this tomorrow. [INAUDIBLE] sleep. It's respect. It's about respect. He's already gone home. He can't just feel like he can pay us whenever he wants. You do this every time. We're already here. Why can't we wait until tomorrow? Why does it matt-- what? We could just call him. We'll figure out tomorrow if we do-- Hey! Now, what-- hey, don't you see I'm busy here? Look, I'll pay y'all later. Let me just finish up first. Hey! Whoa! Whoa! Oh shit! Oh f-- Oh shit. [SMACKS] Oh! [CHEERING] Oh, bite him. Bite his ear off. Hoo! Ground and pound. Ground and pound. Ooh! Put him in the guillotine! Put him in the guillotine. Tap his ass out. [LAUGHING] [RAP MUSIC PLAYING] Hear my confession. Girl, you the source of my stressin'. I treat my loss as a lesson. Could be for nothin'. You could be out here finessin'. Instead it's my phone that you textin'. Look to the sky. I thank God for my blessin'. I act like I'm good on my own, but I'm flexin'. Girl, if I could, I would buy you the world, buy you a crib, toss the keys to the Jeep. Sometimes what you need, it be sittin' in front of you. Put me to the test. Going far from your other dudes. Just need a chance. That way, I can get close to you. Knew it was nothing the first time I spoke to-- You just gonna play games now? Dude, it's the playoffs. Are you-- what are you-- It's game seven right now. Game seven? What-- it's like in the middle of the night right now. How did you just pick up and resume a game? I'm like this close to getting a championship. Get up. Oh my god. Dude, forget that, man. I came back 3-1. It was this-- Seriously, we need to help this girl. She's incapacitated right now. Get the hell up, dude. Oh my god. Dude, you gotta do it. Dude, come on. There's got to be another way to do this. Just open her mouth. How about-- how about-- how about I do that part, and you do this part? What? No. I'm her significant other, so I have to save her life, all right? That doesn't even makes sense. Like, how-- How does that not make sense to you? All right? Why don't you do it? Because I'm-- Why don't you feel compelled to? Dude, I'm black. She's gonna take me to jail. What the hell-- you cannot just pull the race card out of nowhere. What-- this is how it starts in TV shows. Friends are like, oh, go ahead. Go try it. And I'm like, oh, OK, I'll do it. Jail. Just put your hands on her face, OK? OK. OK. Oh, yeah. All right, dude. All right, you got it? So you lean her head back. You got it. That's too much. That might be too-- Shit! [GAGGING] Oh, oh. Mm. Ah. Mm. Jail. Jail. [PUKING] Mickey. Oh, that's a lot of throw up. What-- oh. So go over again if you want to-- if you-- oh god. It's gonna be OK. It's gonna be all right. Oh. Oh, whoa. What the hell do we do? Leave her ass in there until she feels better. Seriously? What else are we gonna do? Look, she's got to sleep that shit off. Throw a bottle of water in there or something. I'm just glad we were there. Gio is a piece of shit. I've been trying to tell you that. Who tries to mess with a chick who's passed out? It's her own damn fault for getting herself in that shit. You're kidding me, right? Please tell me you're joking. Look, I'm not saying what he was gonna do was right, but I'm not gonna sit here and act so damn shocked that that was gonna happen to her, you know? You can't blame the victim for rape. I'm not blam-- look at it this way. Would you let one of those promoters make your sister a drink? Hell no. And why is that? Because they're creeps. Exactly. That's all I'm saying. She should be aware of her surroundings. Look, shit happens, and I'm not denying that, OK? But she should at least lower the percentage of chance that she'll be harmed by somebody else. You of all people don't live in fear of others, so why the hell should she? Should isn't reality. Should isn't gonna stop crazy people from trying to harm her. Look, no matter how well-dressed or protected someone is, crazy people are still gonna be crazy. Well, maybe we figure out a w-- Whe-- where am I? My place. You're safe. How are-- No. No, no, no. Where are my car keys? Where are my car keys? Uh, I don't-- I don't know. Why did you bring me here? Uh, because Gio was trying to touch you while you were passed out. That's it? I th-- What? I just-- just where are my keys? I don't know. Would you just stop for a second and talk to me? Cody, I cannot afford to lose this job, OK? I need the money. So you're willing to let them use you? I use them just as much as they use me, OK? But that doesn't-- Look, Cody, it's not pretty, but it's my decision, OK? I know that what you saw looked weird, but it was all a plan, OK? Sometimes he and I, we try strange things. And what you saw was the plan. It was consensual, I promise. Where is he? I knocked him out. (LAUGHING) You did what? Are y'all together? No. I don't know. I'm not with anyone. You hit him? That's kind of hot. I just want to experience life and have fun and experiment, OK? By getting roped in a coma? Don't judge me. How can you stand there and expect me to be OK with this? What kind of a relationship is that? Can't we just enjoy a this summer, Cody? Look, you and I are not going to be that couple that everyone cheers for to win prom king and queen, OK? My job, it isn't pretty, but I'm good at it. And not all of us have our parents paying for our apartments. OK? Please don't judge me. I can't talk about this right now. I need my keys. Look, they're probably at the pre-game house. Screw it. I'll just call an Uber. I'm sorry, Cody. Please don't be mad. I gotta go. Call you later, OK? "Don't be mad." What the hell just happened? I guess it was consensual. Wow. Hey, look, man, that wasn't your fault. There's no way in hell you-- I just-- how can she be so-- [SIGHS] I think I'm just gonna call it a night. And I'm sorry. I think I just got us fired. No, man, don't worry about that shit. I'm glad we're done with those guys. You get some sleep. Get some rest. Let me worry about the next move. [VIDEO GAME BEEPING] Dude, what the hell are you wearing? What? Your shoes look like they were eaten by a dog. Do you think he's gonna be looking at my shoes the whole time, OK? You can wear-- My eyes are up here, dude. He's gonna be seeing this fine Italian shirt. Do they not have irons in Italy? This is mustard yellow, OK? It's this year's fashion color, OK? I don't need you right now. Sorry about that, guys. Someone dropped the ball on some inventory, blah, blah, blah, whatever. Not your problem. No worries. You guys are doing amazing work. Just a couple of things I want to change. First, no shots of pre-game partying or buses. It makes it look trashy and like we're at a tailgating party. And we're also aiming for a sexy but classy look. So we're talking about the uptown crowds and local colleges. So you know, show mainly them. Them? Them. So more crazy, rich, white people in the video. Look, we're both minorities here. I'm not saying exclude us. I'm just saying know your customer. The only color I care about is green. Aside from that, everything else is great. So I'll need you on Thursdays for college nights, Fridays for EDM neon nights, and then some Saturdays for celebrity DJs and performers. Did you just say celebrities? Yes, sir. I'll even throw in a little extra on celebrity nights. Hell yeah. Name your price. Well, we just got some brand new camera equipment, and the total price also covers all the editing, as well. And we do as many re-edits as you like. But it's gonna be $400 total. Done. I'll see you gentlemen on Thursday. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Pleasure. [DING] [SLOW ROCK MUSIC PLAYING] [CHILL MUSIC PLAYING] Ooh. I like that. OK. Just because I can do something doesn't mean that I should. That's fair. I can behind that. You sure you're not like a psych major or something? What kind of job would a degree in psychology get me exactly? See, that. That right there. That's exactly what I'm talking about. Why does everything have to be about some type of end result or goal? Why can't it just be about, hey, I really like that thing. I should try it. Life's short. Take a risk. I've watched you take risks, and I think actually I'm OK. OK, that's fair. How about take a calculated risk? OK, I'll take a calculated risk. OK, what's the risk? I'm not gonna tell you. What the-- it's a risk, not a secret. It'll still come true if you tell me. I'll take a calculated risk if you would be more careful. Deal. What the hell is that? My pinky. Pinky promise. Oh my god. Give me your pinky, damnit. [PROGRESSIVE ROCK MUSIC PLAYING] Dude, just because a chick puts out doesn't mean that you have chemistry. I agree. You're right. And the thing is, she didn't put out. No. We made out a little bit, and then she rolled over and went to sleep. You liked blue balls? Everything's not about sex. She had self-confidence, self-esteem. She was witty. And she didn't put out. Dude, she sounds a lot like Kay. You know that? Ooh. You see, first of all, that's a low blow. Second of all, no. Hell no. Kay was a compulsive liar. This girl, she's smart. I think she was testing me. Yeah, she didn't put out because she wanted to see if I'd still be interested in the morning. And guess what? I am. I am still interested. Yeah. Well, just remember to tell drunk Jay that you like someone. What the hell is that supposed to mean? Yeah. Sober Jay knows that you like someone, but drunk Jay thinks that you're technically still single, so be careful. Whatever, man. Look, I'll be fine. No, I like this girl way too much for that. And I just met you. I bet you talk to all girls like this. OK, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'll stop. I was trying to be funny. It's not working, clearly. So can, um-- can we please just, you and me, go back to the club and do some dancing? I'm serious. I have work in the morning. Not all of us promote nightclubs. Oh! Oh, oh, ouch. OK, see, that's-- that's the first problem. No, I'm not a promoter. I'm not one of the promoter types, you know? And what would you say are those promoter types? Come on. You know the type. It's the same guy. They're all the same. They're loud, chauvinist, cocky, and they lie. They lie a lot. They lie a lot. Oh, I don't see any difference. Babe, I'm a videographer. Did you just make that word up? [LAUGHS] Damn! OK, I'm striking out tonight. All right, well, what can I do to prove to you that I'm not one of those promoter types? Well, after tonight, nothing. Sorry, babe. Have a nice night. Hey! Where you going? Oh, OK, yeah, you probably got curfew. You go. Yeah, whatever. I'm gonna go in there and I'm gonna go talk to all the girls because they're just-- [FRUSTRATED GRUNTING] [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING] Keep up, Cody. The only reason anyone knows how lit a Club Life party was is because of our videos. Take some credit, man. "Oh, bro, what do the girls look like? How big is the crowd?" "Oh my god, what was the music like?" We are the club. They owe us, Cody. We gotta get what we're worth. I get what you're saying-- like, I really do-- but we got a good thing going here. I'm not trying to make waves. See, that's that feeling shit, Cody. You can't feel numbers. You gotta think, look at the income. Look at the crowd. That's money that's slipping through our hands. You know? I should've known that prick Alex was a snake the second he said yes so quickly to my offer of $400. $400 is fine, man. That works for me. Two days' work, that's $800, plus $500 if it's a celebrity event. Chump change. That's what that adds up to. We can double that. You're insane. I prefer innovative. Come on. $650 a night? For you, boss man? Come on. That's chump change, man. Have you seen how many customers have been coming into your club since we started working here? Those videos are killing it. Cody, tell him. You were just telling me, "More people, bro, dude. We should get more mon--" tell him, man. Come on. Why you being all quiet now? And you-- you fired an entire marketing team, which is a beautiful move, might I add. They were unprofessional and childish, anyways. So there's got to be money just floating around. You're not telling me how to allocate my money when it comes to my club, right? No. No, no, no, no. No, sir. No, sir. I'm just protecting my brand, if you will. I know my worth. You taught me that. You did learn something. Well, then you're right. We both have to look out for our brands. So $650 it is. Boom! Woo! Yes! Thank you, sir. We will continue to bring the magic with every video. You better. Woo! [BELL RINGING] I love that shit. All right. Let's go. [DUBSTEP MUSIC PLAYING] They call her brat. What? Hi. Yeah, can I get six honey butter biscuits with chicken? Can I add bacon and cheese to four of them? But leave the others how they are, whatever. And then can I get three shakes-- one vanilla, one strawberry, and one chocolate? And then those "al carbon" taco things. Two of those. Um, and-- oh. Jay, do you want anything? No, that's all. [MUTTERING] Got you some water, buddy. [GROANING] It's nice and cold. There we go. I drank a little bit of it. But it's whatever. [DOOR CLOSING] [CELL PHONE VIBRATING] Hello? [COUGHING] [RAP MUSIC PLAYING] And I can't even front 'cause it's the life I chose. [COUGHING] [GASPING] [CAR BEEPING] [CHUCKLING] [CAN CRINKLING] Shit. [SLOWED-DOWN MUSIC PLAYING] Hear my confession. Girl, you're the source of my stressin'. I treat my loss as a lesson. Could be for nothin'. You could be out here finessin'. Instead it's my phone that you're textin'. Look to the sky. I thank God for my blessin'. I act like I'm good on my own, but I'm flexin'. Girl, if I could-- Are you OK? This isn't how I planned it. Planned what, Katie? What are you talking about? Um. Well, you see, I lied. About what? I wasn't in trouble. Then what the hell are you doing out here? Does your mom know you're out here? Just listen, and I'll tell you everything. I hate that you think I'm a kid. I'm 18 now, and I want you to see me as an adult. I'm dressed this way because I like to dress this way. I don't want you to tutor me anymore but only help me if I ask you to. My mom thinks I'm spending the night at Lauren's, which isn't completely a lie because when I'm done here, I'm headed there. I lied to get you here because I knew you wouldn't come if I told you why. You can tell me anything. I know. Well, I want you to be my first. Katie, no. Katie, no. No, no, no, no. No, Katie. Katie, whoa, whoa. I'm 18 now, and I haven't, you know. And I don't want to be the only one in college who hasn't yet. So I just thought, why not us? Us? Katie, look, it's not that I don't think you're an attractive person, OK? It's just I'm supposed to protect you, you know? Big brother. Like you said, get out of jail free card, remember? You're not supposed to just give your virginity away, OK? You're supposed to protect that and share that moment with somebody special. Did you share yours with someone special? You said you'd never lie to me. No, I didn't. I gave it away chasing the idea that it was gonna make me a man, OK? It was a terrible mistake. It's only a four year difference. OK, I just had a birthday. That's what made it four. If we do this, that makes me like all the people that I was trying to protect you from, you know? You're wrong. The people you told me who were going to hunt me down and manipulate me, I hunted and manipulated you. [GIGGLES] That's not funny. Yeah, it is. OK. OK. How about this. How about we talk about this when I'm not drunk? Please? OK. Ught! Bring it in. Come on. Come on. [MOANING] Shit! [GASPING] Oh, my back. [EXHALING] Yo, Jay. Hey. Get up. What happened? First off, I want to thank you for the incredible work you've done this past month. Also, I hope you enjoyed the free table and bottle service at your birthday party. We've received so many great compliments in regards to your work. Unfortunately, we're gonna have to end this business relationship. We can no longer afford your product. So I wish you two success in your future, and I hope you find clients-- Mm! It's over! Dude, no it's not. We'll just call and renegotiate like always. Dude, if he wanted to renegotiate, he would have said so. Well, we don't just give up. We can try. The second that we get in good with them, you're just gonna ask for more money and ruin it again. You saying this is my fault? You can't keep your ego in check for two seconds without doing some reckless shit. Reckless? I'm the reckless one? Doesn't that make you stop and think for a second? That me, of all people, are telling you that? OK, you're so greedy now. And you're drunk every single day. And you're never satisfied with the result. (SLURRING) OK, Cody, since you're the oh-so-sensible, logical one now, tell me what should we have done? That's the thing. We shouldn't have done anything. We should've just kept going to work and making money. But no, we had to save the world. We make videos, dude. I was just trying to get what we're worth, man. And what are we worth? Please tell me. And I bet it'll change in a week. Whatever, man. I don't need this shit. Just admit it, that you can't control yourself anymore. The second that money is involved, you become a completely different person. Yeah, OK. What about you, Cody, huh? One of us prefers not to settle all the time and just get by by doing just enough. If we don't take ourselves serious, no one will. Does that include running around like some macho jackass in your fancy suits? I show up to business meetings like I belong there, and not like some stoner pothead. "Belong"? That's the thing. You want to belong there. Like, belong? I mean, god, that racist son of a bitch probably wouldn't even let you in the club if it weren't for your videos. See, they don't want you. You're nothing to them. You'd be sitting out in the line if it weren't for your camera. Or maybe you lost sight of that. All we were supposed to do was use them like they were using us, remember? Us? We? What do we do exactly, Cody, huh? Because if I'm recalling this correctly, I found us that last job while you were off trying to be Captain Save-A-Ho. Yeah, remember? I edit all the videos. I do all the talking. What-- what do you do, exactly, huh? Besides ride my coattails from all the work that I'm putting in? Is that what you think? Dude, I don't know what to think, OK? I don't want to do this right now. I can't remember last night. Pieces are missing. I hurt a lot of people. I just want to fix all this shit and go back to bed. Now, look, we can stand out here and complain and whine all morning, or you can help me. Are you gonna help me or what? No. See, I don't want to ride your coattails. Good luck with that. Cody. Cody! [DOOR CLOSING] Katie, um, did we do anything last night? Oh, boy. Shit. No, we didn't. We didn't? We didn't. Are you sure? Oh, shit. [CHEERFULLY GRUNTING] [LAUGHING] Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh, that was close. Gee, thanks. No, no, no. I didn't mean it like, you know-- in like a weird-- I'm just kidding. I agree with what you said last night. What, um-- what the hell happened last night? I just-- I remember we were standing pretty close, and, uh-- And you blacked out. [LAUGHING] See, this is why drinking is a-- wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. How did you get me out of there? Well, I tried waking you up at first, but that didn't work. Then I tried dragging you, but you're too fat. But then your phone rang, and it was your friend Cody? Oh, shit. What's wrong? He and I, um, we got in a little argument earlier, and I need to, um, apologize. Jerk. Yeah. Yeah, I am. Are we, um-- are we cool? Yeah, we're cool. What do you want for your birthday? Hm. A hot fudge sundae. That's it? Yes. OK, cool. I'm gonna get you a new laptop because yours is shit. And then we'll go get sundaes. OK. [CELL PHONE VIBRATING] Hello? You need to help me fight these 12-year-olds online, man. They keep talking so much shit about my mom and grandma, dude. I don't know how these kids think of these things. Like, honestly. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, sounds good, man. Get your ass over here. OK, cool. I'll see you soon. You got him. You got him. Throw it. Throw it! Do it. Oh! Oh! Yeah! Damn! Oh! Rip your children's limbs off and then beat your mother with those limbs? I-- Wow. I don't know. I'm sorry. Hey, man, so I-- I talked to Katie earlier today, and I just want to say that-- Oh, bro, skip that. We're dawgs. Shit happens. I appreciate that, man. Look, I don't give you enough credit. You're always there, especially when I screw up. And I screw up a lot. So, uh, thank you. You want a beer? No, no. Water would be perfect. All right. Soft. You know, I had an amazing time with you last night, before-- Before you were an asshole? Before I was an asshole, yes. Was that your ex? No. No, no, no. No, no. Hell no. No, it was-- it was-- her and I, it was like a summer fling. We were hooking up off and on, and we stopped. We stopped long before you and I started talking, you know. And-- and Mickey and her are really good friends. And she wasn't invited to the party. And I was like, that's kind of weird, but I didn't want her to think it was weird because there's no feelings there. It was just-- So you were a dumbass. I'm a dumbass, yes. I'm a big, stupid dumbass. Yeah, I know. You know, Cody and I are just kicking it at the house if you want to swing by, bite to eat. I can cook you something. It probably won't be very good, but-- Um, I can't. I'm packing. I'm heading to my parents' for a week. Oh. Oh, in Aspen? No, idiot, in Houston. Yeah, that-- that sounds fun. That's real cool. You're not gonna cry, are you? Dani, I am so sorry. Yeah, you are. You sure you don't want to swing by just-- just for a second? I don't think that's the best idea right now. But maybe when I get back, you can show me that casino in Oklahoma or whatever that you were talking about. Oh, really? Because I was gonna ask you to teach me biomedical engineering. But yeah, yeah, sure, gambling sounds fun, too. Oh my god, I hate you. I have to go finish getting ready. Later, Dani. Text me. Asshole. How'd it go, man? I don't know, man. I-- I screwed up pretty bad. See, you gotta go back to dating black girls. You're so right. I know! They just-- they just get us, man. Check who's social media official. Ooh. Yeah. Yeah. [LAUGHING] You all right, man? Yeah, I'm good. He'll be looking pretty ugly with that black eye for the next couple of weeks. Am I right? Hmm. Still do miss Mickey, though. Yikes. Ah, whatever. Just bottle those feelings up. I'll just push on forward. Dude, are you sure you're OK? Yeah. They deserve each other. Plus, I'll just put it in the movie. Movie? What movie? Our film project? It's due in like two weeks, remember? Shit. Bro, I don't even want to touch a camera right now. I really don't care if we fail or-- Look, besides spending money on fast food and lotion, I've been saving all my money for the short film. And there won't be any ninjas or horses in this one, OK? I'm listening. OK. Check it. Open up on two dudes outside of a club, waiting to get in. Huh? Hm? [CHUCKLING] [RECORD SKIPPING] [POP MUSIC PLAYING] (SINGING) I'm waiting for you to come around again. But I can't wait forever. I'm waiting. I want you so bad. But I can't wait forever. I can't wait forever.
