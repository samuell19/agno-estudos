It's my new thing. I'm addicted. I can't work without music anymore. Nice though, isn't it? I never saw this make of car as a taxi. Yes, there are only two in Istanbul. One of them is in, umm... Suadiye. And this is the other. - It works, though. - Yes, it's a good car. What's this smell? What smell? Smells like soft soap. Oh yeah. I cleaned up the car today. They say it kills the germs. - Cologne? - No. - You maybe? - No, thanks. You are in Radio İstanbul This is your host, Naim Meriç, presenting you “The Tunes From the World” You have just listened to Arigato by Mira Mayer Now, a song from far away, from Finland will be on your radios. We are welcoming a young artist from Helsinki, Ilari Kivisto Kalevalan Tango. You will feel yourself under the Northern lights, feeling a breeze of love in the lands far away. Don't forget to turn on the volume a little up. Is that a dog? There in the middle of the road. Yes. Let me take a quick look. The animal's injured. It's suffering. Give me a hand moving it off the road. Come and wash the dirt off your hands. There's water in the car. Just a second, your shoes are wet. Let me put down some newspaper. Your bag's open. Shall I zip it up? No, leave it. Keep out of there. Boy, is that heavy! What's in there? Hey, driver! Can you give me a lift to Kumkapı? Sorry brother, there is no room. We were out fishing, please, we're all soaking. I told you, there is no room. Sorry. Welcome to the show Mr. Bedri. How do you do? Thanks. I'm fine. Are you nervous? Of course, a little. What is your occupation? I was an officer in Anatolia. Recently I was assigned as the chief of operations in the Central Post Office. Where did you serve? First, it was Yozgat Post Office. Then it was Kars. How wonderful! You're delivering a sacred service. Not at all, it's our job! Police. There's a checkpoint. Lovers in different cities, workers in Germany… Everyone is waiting for that one letter from the loved ones. We're working hard to deliver it to its owners. So, tell me, where does your interest in Classical Music come from? From my dear grandfather. He was a magnificent violinist. Slow down! He was also one of the writers of the Encyclopedia of Music. Good evening. Good evening, officer. What can I do for you? What's up? Is there a problem? Where are you going? Where? Umm, Samatya. Samatya. OK, but where in Samatya? The Mimoza. - The Mimoza? - Yes. - For a night out? - No, officer. To work. We're musicians. Really? OK, step out of the car. So you're musicians. What kind of music? Mostly western music, officer. Jazz, blues, calypso, that kind of thing. Does the Mimoza do live music? That's news to me. They do, officer. Every night except Sundays and Mondays. What are the prices like? - I bet it's expensive. - Not really, but find me when you come. - I'll have the boss give you a discount. - That would be great. But I want to come when you're playing. - My wife loves that sort of music. - We'll be expecting you. - What was your name? - Hayati. Hayati from Yedikule Police Station. Stop! Slow down. You don't have an easy job either. Working late into the night. You'll start now and might be there all night, huh? - Does it at least pay well? - Not bad, but... There's a lot of expense. It's show business. You know what that's like. Dammit! The power's gone off again. For God's sake! - Where are you two coming from? - From fishing. - Whose bag is this? Is it yours? - It's mine, officer. - What's that? - Rifle. - Is this rifle yours, too? - I found it down on the shore. You found a gun on the shore? What exactly is your occupation? I'm a fisherman, Sir. Hayati! Hayati! Hayati! What's up? Can you come over? He says he is a fisherman... and he found it on the shore. On the shore where? Kumkapı. After a fishing trip. I stumbled upon it actually. I was planning to turn it in this morning but I didn't have time. What do you mean you didn't have time? You haven't shown your license either. Come on, show me your license. - Can we go, officer? - Yes, you carry on. Have a good evening. Şinasi! What are you waiting for? Didn't I tell you to carry on? I told you I don't have my license on me. - You're headed for Samatya, aren't you? - Yes, officer. Don't go down Vatan Avenue. It's completely closed for road work. Take a right off the road behind the mosque. There's a road down from the cemetery. You know where I mean? Yes. I know. That's the route to take. Thanks. Imagine if we had taken that fisherman with us! We'd be spending the night in custody. Take a right and then left up ahead. Aren't we going to Samatya? Do as I say. Make a left. Slowly. - Here? - Yeah, here. And stop after we've turned. What do we owe you? - What do we owe you? - Sorry, I'm not with you. The fare. How much is it? The meter says 18, but 15 will do. Reha, have you got five lira? Welcome. Welcome. At last! Kemal, what's that thing there? - That thing? A Frigidaire. - What? A Frigidaire. Also known as a cooling cabinet. I'm taking on the dealership, Şinasi. Look, they delivered this yesterday as a model. You see? It's a godsend. Especially for women. Fruits, vegetables, milk... They don't get spoiled for days! It works wonders! Sounds like you found a great job. But what about the bakery? You know the bakery was my father's. That makes giving it up hard. I want it to carry on as far as it can. How is your father by the way? He's fine. He grew old, can't go out much nowadays. What do we do if Nazif doesn't turn up? You know we said we'd go in his car. His situation is a little complicated. How come? I don't know yet, but we'll find out soon. It's been like this all day. That call still hasn't gone through. Should we try again? Give it time. Nazif hasn't turned up either. I say let's get going. We can't afford to be late. Give him a bit longer. I think he'll come. But it's up to you. Kemal, do these cost a lot? What's that, Reha? - Those cabinets. What were they called? - Frigidaires. They're around 3000 lira, but you can pay in instalments. That's expensive! But don't worry, I can let you have it at cost. No, I was just curious about the price. I couldn't afford it just now anyway. Still, it's a lot of money. That's Nazif. Welcome, Nazif. - Thanks. - Have a seat. Where have you been, Nazif? Don't ask. I had the feeling a car was following me. You know that crossroads going into Vatan from Topkapı? It was there. I couldn't help being suspicious. The road was empty. No traffic. But the car was on my tail. I slow down, he slows down. I accelerate, he accelerates. But he won't overtake. I got to the end of Vatan, turned into a side-street in Laleli... And parked and the side of the road. I waited quite some time. I checked the car was gone and came straight here. Sorry. I'm late, I know. Well? How are you guys? Fine. Everything's fine, Nazif. Good. Fri-gi-dye-reh. It's pronounced Fri-ji-dair, Nazif. Fri-ji-dair. Right. Frigidaire. Kemal, can I have some water? I'm so thirsty. So, Reha. What's the situation? What are we doing? We're waiting, Nazif. Reha. Are you a bit on edge tonight? He's a bit annoyed that you were late, that's all. How did you know? Vatan Avenue was closed to traffic all night. - Kemal. - Yes, Reha? Answer the phone. Hello? OK. Good night... Thanks. Reha, Ankara isn't answering. - Why did you load the bread? - For the deliveries, boss. - Didn't I tell you not to, Murat? - I can do them after dropping you. It's crazy going back and forth. Well, OK. Reha, you go in front. No, Kemal, you go. Then you can give directions. OK. Climb in and let's go then. Hold the torch, will you? I don't suppose we'll be long, will we, boss? I don't know, Murat. Why do you ask? You know, because I have the bread to deliver. We'd better get some fuel by the way. - Are we running low? - Best to be on the safe side. The indicator's broken so I can't tell. It runs out just like that. The indicator's broken, is it? How many times have I told you? Do things properly. How long would it take to get it fixed? I don't think it'll be a problem but you know, just in case. Kemal, your van is perfect for picnics. Yes. There's so much space. Throw all the kit in the back, right? - We go with friends every week. - Really? To Belgrade Forest, the seaside, wherever. It's great. Does you good, too. The fresh air is relaxing. - Let's go together one week. - Sure, Şinasi. Why not? - It'll be good. And the van's all set. - OK. What's up, Murat? Let me just drop off that bread. I won't be long. Is Rıfat inside? He told me you were going to be four. Anyway. Come in. He's upstairs. Isn't this Korea? Yes. That's Ayhan Mandıracı next to me. Recognize him? Yes. You're right, Ayhan was in Korea, too. Rıfat. Did you fight in Korea? Yes, I was there. Well I'll be damned! I never knew that. He was there, but he didn't fight. How do you mean? Tell him yourself, Rıfat. Don't go into that now. Go on, let's hear it. Go on! Then I'll tell, but keep calm, all right? OK, so Rıfat... Korea wanted their national anthem sung at some ceremony. So he learned the thing. He has a good voice as you know. He'd done theatre in the military, too, so was perfect for the job. Anyway, to make long story short... He learnt the anthem and went to Korea. Come the day of the ceremony he steps on stage and starts singing. The audience freezes. First there's silence, then a murmur of voices. Rıfat doesn't notice it first. He keeps going. To be fair, he sang beautifully. Let's give him his credit. Then he realizes the thing he spent so long memorizing... Isn't the South Korean national anthem, it's the North Korean one! They couldn't send him back fast enough! - It wasn't my fault. There was a mix-up. - What kind of mix-up? Didn't you know about it? It was the talk around the town. No, it's the first time I've heard of it. The top brass used to have him sing the Korean anthem at their bashes. The uniforms are in the other bag. I'll just get them from the car. 'The present government...' 'Has failed to abide by...' 'The constitution and the laws of the republic...' 'It is common knowledge...' 'That every aspect of public life has been paralysed.' But Reha, that's a problematic sentence. What's problematic about it, Rıfat? The verb should be active, not passive. So we should say, 'this has paralysed public life.' What's the difference, Rıfat? 'Has been paralysed' is one thing, 'has paralysed' quite another. 'It is common knowledge...' 'That this has paralysed every aspect of public life.' 'It is commonly known.' No. 'It is common knowledge.' That sounds better. Şinasi, hand out the guns. Guys, get your guns. Murat, slow down. You'll be turning right very soon. Slow right down. Now stop here. Stop! Turn off the headlights. Switch off the engine. OK, guys. May God watch over us. Open the door, son. Murat, open the door! You can't park there, move on! I said move on! - Boss, can I go? - Reha! - What should he do? - Stay here. He can't go. You stay here, son. - Sgt Sefer, Samsun. At your command! - Sergeant. As of now, the Armed Forces have seized power. The radio station is under military command, OK? Now open the door for us. Didn't you hear? Open the door! - Sir, I have orders to let no one in. - Those orders are obsolete. Open the door! Murat, catch him! Murat, get him! OK, Murat. OK, Murat. Get off him. OK. Get up. Why are you running away, huh? Son, why are you running away? Huh? Why are you running away? Rıfat, it's OK. Stop. Rıfat! Here, take your hat and get going. Boss, is my tooth bleeding here? - I think the tooth is broken. - I don't care right now, Murat. Lift your arms up. You can put them down. Your turn now. I said lift them up! Lift your arms up. - OK. Is this all you are, sergeant? - Yes, sir. - Who are you? - The caretaker. - You? - Police officer Selami. Good. Friends, as of this moment the Armed Forces have seized power. Now, sergeant. Show us the announcement room. The station is off air now, sir, so the announcement room is locked. OK. Şinasi. Have the sergeant show you the room and break down the door. Yes, colonel. Get going! Sir, the manager has keys to all the rooms. - Well, where's the manager? - Upstairs in his lodgings. You mean there are lodgings here and he lives in them? Yes, on the top floor of the building. Sergeant, back to your place. - Caretaker, you know these lodgings? - Yes, sir. Şinasi, take the caretaker and bring the manager here. Yes, sir. Come with me. Police officer, you come here. Kemal, take the soldiers somewhere safe. Soldiers, at ease! Attention! About turn! Frankly, I'd never have guessed... that the manager had quarters in the building. Does anyone else live in the building? No, sir. Just the manager on the top floor. He's a lucky man. Very lucky. Living right in the heart of the city. Maybe he even has a view. He does. A view of the Bosphorus right alongside the Hilton. You're employed here by the police department, are you? Yes, that's right. On assignment. There are two of us. Another guy works days. Right. I've been here six months. - But it's easy here, sir. - Good. After all, what can happen at a radio station? Great. It's a pretty quiet, peaceful place. - Kemal! - Reha. I collected the guns. And I locked the soldiers in a room. The situation is under control. - It's been easier than I thought. - Good work, Kemal. - Is that coffee you're making? - Yes. Like some? - If it's no trouble. - Sure. - I take just a little sugar. - You too. Any news from Ankara, Reha? The call hasn't gone through yet. We're waiting. Things look calm out there. Is that building the Central Command? - Which building, sir? - See that one there? Yes, that's Central Command. But there's no one about. Turan's men don't seem to be here yet. They will be soon. Our real reinforcements arrive after midnight. A bus load of cadets. Hello? Yes? Speaking, yes. Yes. Understood. Thank you. Good night. What's going on, Reha? It appears Ankara isn't answering. - Is this the announcement machine? - Yes, that's it. OK, then let's get started. Rıfat! But in the heat of the moment I forgot to say. The staff member who operates the machine... Is absent from the premises at present. What do you mean he's absent? I don't understand. Well, can't you operate the machine? No, I'm no good at technical things. I'm only here for temporary duty. I'm actually a sociologist. But someone must know how to work the machine. Of course they do. But because we come off air at 10 pm... That staff member is at home now. We can pick him up if you like. We picked up Tevfik from his home during the 1960 coup. We didn't need even needed that in the last year's coup because no one came here. Are you saying we should fetch the man from his house now? We'll waste valuable time. Look, manager. If you're doing this to play for time, you'll regret it later. Be warned. No, sir. I wouldn't dream of it. That's just the way things are, I'm afraid. Colonel. Shall I give it a try? OK, go on. Kemal. Go to that microphone next door. Go there and wait. Is there a radio here so we can check the sound? - Sure. Shall I turn it on? - Please. Kemal, count from 1 to 10. One, two, three, four, five, six.. OK, that'll do. Again. One, two, three, four, five… Hello? Good evening. Can you put me through to a number? OK. 58-37-11. Just a moment please. - They're asking where the number is. - Ankara. It's an Ankara number. OK. We have to wait a little while. What's your connection to Tevfik? Forgive me, I forgot to introduce myself. I'm Hamdi İrdal, manager of Radio Istanbul. We need Tevfik's help with a technical matter. Did I hear you right? You're manager of Radio Istanbul. Yes, exactly. Good Lord. How interesting. You know, manager, the radio never goes off in this house. Really? I listen to everything, even the agricultural program. 'Turkish Poetry from the Tanzimat Reforms to the Present Day'... That's terrific. Also 'The Rural Life in the Turkish Novel'. - There's a contest Orhan Boran presents. - 'Knowledge Wins'. Yes, 'Knowledge Wins'. My wife used to love that. We'd even compete against each other for that matter. We tried to get onto the program through Tevfik. But it coincided with my wife's illness. And then she passed away. I buried her four months ago. - I'm sorry to hear it. - Thank you. - My condolences. - Thank you. Well, manager... Don't misunderstand, but I have a criticism to make. Of course. Please, go ahead. You give too much airtime to western music. That's to say, I'd like to hear more alla turca. You see, I'm a fan of alla turca. But my wife liked western music. That was our only quarrel. She used to listen to jazz. I can't stand it. It's just a riot of noise. Don't you think? I actually think we give Alaturca enough airtime. As you'll appreciate, we must cater to all tastes in our programming. - But I'll bear your criticism in mind. - Thank you very much. Not at all. How can we find this Tevfik? It's rather urgent. Well, Tevfik... Tevfik... Tevfik... I don't know where he is. He'll be back soon enough. - He has a wife. A nurse. - Yes, I know. I don't think they get along so well. I heard she'd walked out. - Really? - Yes. But she's a great girl. When my wife was ill, she was a great help, bless her. Tevfik is a decent man, too. I mean, he pays his rent on time. Manager. I'd like your advice about something. You know the ads that go out on the radio? Well, my question is how much would a short ad cost? What kind of ad? A friend of mine is starting a cooling cabinet business. Yes. - Maybe you've heard of Frigidaires. - Yes. - He's taking on the dealership. - Right. I happened to overhear him talking about it. He wants to advertise on radio so I thought I'd ask. To be honest, I don't know the price of ads. I know the Frigidaire brand, but... I'm not up on prices. But I can ask the guy in charge and let you know. - Thank you. - No problem. That's very kind. I'm sorry, I forgot to ask. - Would you like a drink? - No, thank you. Not for me. - A drink? - No, thank you. Not for me. I don't drink much either. Just a glass in the evening sometimes. A double raki at most. But your taste in drinks is exceptional. As far as I know, that sort of Martini is very hard to find in Turkey. - It's a superb drink. - Yes. I have a tenant who travels abroad a lot on business. He was kind enough to get it. I can't bring myself to open it. So it's just sitting there waiting for a special occasion. You know what they say about Martini. It's America's most lethal weapon. If I remember right it was Khrushchev who said that. As far as I know, manager, Martini is Italian, not American. Really? Are you sure that saying isn't about Martin rifles? In fact, there's that song 'Fire Your Martin, Hasan'. - Ruhi Su sings it. - Yes, you're right. Sorry. This business is dragging on too long. Is there no alternative, manager? We have another technician, but he lives over on the Asian shore. How hard can it be? Can you really not work the machine? I'm afraid not. This is incredible. It's quite beyond me. If both men died at the same time or something else happened... Wouldn't you be forced off air? Would Radio Istanbul just shut down? If that was the case we'd obviously work something out. The 1960 coup was easier because Tevfik was at home. But we have no warning of these events and get caught unprepared as a result. So you want warning if we stage a coup? For heaven's sake! - No, I didn't mean that. - Drive a bit faster, boy! I'm going as fast as I can, sir. Reha. What's the situation in Ankara? Fine. No problems. The troops are now well on their way. It'll all be over in a matter of hours. There's a team on its way to Radio Ankara. The announcement will be well underway. But Kemal, look what we're up against. It's a complete scandal! You're right. Here we are still looking for a technician. At worst, the announcement will still be made on Radio Ankara. Won't it? Meaning? Meaning if we don't do it, it isn't the end of the world. Kemal, I'll pretend I didn't hear that. Our job is to make the announcement on Radio Istanbul. I don't know, the streets seem so quiet. But the tanks should already be out there. Kemal, how do you know they aren't? Isn't it strange that we haven't seen a single tank? We have no nurses called Nejla at this hospital. Are you sure? I can look again, but I'm fairly sure. What was her surname? Her surname? I can't remember right now. - Why not check the staff duty roster? - You're right. What on earth was Tevfik's surname? Tevfik... - Aladağ. Could it be Aladağ? - No, it's not Aladağ. - Gümüş? - Yes. Tevfik Gümüş. OK. Nejla Gümüş. She's an anaesthetist, not a nurse. - Really? - Yes. But she has an emergency patient so is probably in surgery right now. But I can go down and check if you like. - Yes, please. - OK. - You can wait here. - Sure, we'll be here. - I'm going down to the operating room. - OK. - Sorry, what was your name? - Hamdi İrdal, manager of Radio Istanbul. OK. Give me a cigarette, will you? And a light. The operation is almost over. I left a message. - She'll be up when her patient comes to. - OK. What do you mean “when her patient comes to”? As an anaesthetist... She must wait with the patient until he or she comes to. Nurse, we must see her urgently. She needs to help us with something. Don't worry, I'll go down and have a word with her. I'm afraid that isn't possible. We don't allow non-staff members in the operating rooms. Hospital rules. - Good evening, nurse. - Good evening. I'm here from Forensics Medicine. There is a murder case, a taxi driver was killed. But as we're out of space we brought it here for now. - We'll be back for it tomorrow morning. - OK. But I need to tell the duty manager. Why don't you wait here? Move the trolley over here and shut the door, will you? OK. Turn right here. We stop here. Here, this is it. The place with the lights on. Have you ever been in love, Jale? I raised myself in tough circumstances, Metin. I had no time to even think about it. But still the day can come when you find yourself in love like me. Don't you think that's possible? Yes, it is. - Soon, perhaps? - Yes. How do you see this love? It'll be hard. The man I love is in love. Maybe he's in love with you. I don't know who he's in love with. Do I know the lucky man? Yes, you may know him best of all. Who is it? Not Metin? Yes, it's him. But he loves you. I know he does. I'm very happy in that case. Please tell him that I love him, too. I will, Jale. I'll tell him right away. He'll be so happy. Tell him, Metin. Tell him right away. He's someone who deserves to be happy. Are they military? What's going on? Cüneyt, we have to call it a day. - How come? - I don't understand. OK, this is it. - Back to the radio station now, boss? - Yes, Murat. The radio station. I was thinking to carry on from there to deliver the bread. Is now really the time for bread? But I also have this check-up in the morning. What check-up, Murat? My Germany thing, boss. What Germany thing? What are you talking about? I was going to tell you, but never got the chance. I've signed up to go to Germany as a worker. There's a check-up for it in the morning. Consistent with their remit, the Turkish Armed Forces... Have been obliged to seize control of the government... In order to fulfil their duty... To establish the peace and well-being of state and nation alike. To this end, the National Assembly and Senate have been dissolved. All political parties have been closed. The Turkish Armed Forces... Will form the strong, stable and democratic Republican government... That our nation needs. We hereby pledge to abide by... Our existing international treaties and alliances. To both ensure the safety of the nation and assist the security forces... A curfew has been imposed until further notice. Great Turkish nation... Rest assured that the Armed Forces, your very own children... Will discharge this duty and responsibility with due rigour. Know that we are here at all times for your safety and wellbeing. We tear the sky apart with the hands of steel. We have the Turkish blood! The blood of soldiers! Our heartbeats shake the mountains. Our land is stronger with us. Long live the glorious Turkish Army! With our hearts always proud! No fortress can stand against your glory. Long live the Turkish Nation, The eternal guardian of the history! Long live the glorious Turkish Army! With our hearts always proud! Ideally, you'd also throw in an olive, right? To give it a salty tang. There's a dry version, too. Very strong. You have to go easy or it knocks you out. There's a hilarious joke about dry martini. Two German spies... sneak into a British town during World War II. They feel like a drink and so set off for a pub. One of them speaks great English, the other is nowhere near. The one with good English says to the other... “Don't open your mouth, OK? We have to be careful.” “Leave all the talking to me. I'll order the drinks.” Anyway, they get to the pub. They go in and sit at a table. The waiter comes over. The guy with good English says to the waiter, “Two Martinis.” And the waiter says to them, “Dry?” The other guy butts in and says, “Nein, zwei!” So you know 'drei' means three in German, don't you? - Of course. - Well, that's the thing. - Sure. - 'Drei' is three. In other words, the guy blows their cover. What are we going to do with Nazif? We'll hand over the body today. Let things calm down a bit first. Reha? Whose body? Nazif's. Is Nazif dead? We found a listening device on him. You killed him? We had no choice, Rıfat. We'll say he died in action. Well I'll be damned! Nazif of all people. I'd never have thought in a million years. Kemal? Are you OK? Are you OK, Kemal? This is Radio Istanbul. And now the news. In Ankara last night an attempted coup was carried out... By a group of serving officers aided by others previously pensioned off. The coup attempt was supressed by government forces... And most of the renegade officers incapacitated by security forces. The police are searching nationwide for those renegades still at large. The Prime Minister İsmet İnönü declared that... the enemies of democracy will never triumph. A few minor incidents are also said to have taken place in Istanbul. Cabinet met for an emergency session to discuss events. Following on from the meeting... Martial law was declared for one month in Ankara, Istanbul and Izmir. Taxi driver murder in Istanbul. A taxi driver was found murdered in Samatya area last night.
