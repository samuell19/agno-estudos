Are you okay? Yeah. ﻿Come on. ﻿Let's have another go. ﻿Get over there. ﻿Toss it to Lele. ﻿Come on. Go. Get over there, honey. ﻿Let me help. ﻿- Come on. - Push. ﻿Mama. ﻿It's just a game for kids. ﻿No need to get serious. ﻿But I almost got it. ﻿Let me try again. ﻿Just once, okay? ﻿But can you take it home with you? ﻿One last try. ﻿Yeah! ﻿Thanks, Papa. ﻿Lele. ﻿To scoop a goldfish, ﻿you've got to do it slowly. ﻿Be patient, ﻿don't rush it. ﻿Take it easy. Slowly... ﻿See? ﻿We made it, right? So where sh﻿all we keep it? ﻿Come on, honey. ﻿Watch it. Hop in. ﻿There you go. ﻿You want it? ﻿Yes! I want! Don't spill it! ﻿The more you want, the less I give you. ﻿Let's go and have an early night. We have a morning flight back to Shenzhen tomorrow. ﻿But what about Lake Tian? ﻿Not this time. ﻿I checked, ﻿the road to Lake Tian is closed. ﻿No! ﻿I want to see the Lake Tian Monster. ﻿I promised my buddies I'd take photos of it. ﻿Hi. The road to Lake Tian is closed. ﻿Is there another way? ﻿Where's Papa? ﻿What’s Papa doing? ﻿I have no idea. ﻿I think he's getting directions. ﻿So there's still hope, right? ﻿Cheer up. ﻿Not as good-looking as my little goldfish ﻿Are we on the right track? ﻿There must be people living around here. ﻿We may need some luck ﻿to reach Lake Tian today. ﻿I think I've hit something. ﻿Let me check. ﻿Be careful. ﻿Stay in the car, kids. ﻿I’m going to help Papa. ﻿Duh. We're stock in a ditch. ﻿Need a hand? Y﻿ou take the wheel. ﻿You take the wheel. ﻿OK,then you push it. I ﻿got this. Here we go! ﻿Papa, what's up? What took you so long? ﻿Can we call a tow truck? ﻿Relax. ﻿Lele. ﻿Papa needs to drive and navigate. ﻿He had no rest. It's hard on him. ﻿Stop making excuses. ﻿We won't make it to Lake Tian. ﻿What took him so long? ﻿- Lele, why did you get out? - Mama, I want a drink. ﻿Don't wander off! ﻿Don't do that, Lele! ﻿Why not? ﻿Didn't they teach you at school ﻿to care for the wildlife? ﻿We don't have wildlife at school. ﻿Lele! ﻿Come back! Okay. ﻿Papa! Mama! ﻿Look! There's a car! ﻿- This way we can get to Lake Tian sooner. - Ready? ﻿This way we can get to Lake Tian sooner. ﻿We're almost there. One more time. Done! ﻿Lele! ﻿Honey! ﻿Are you okay? ﻿Leaving your car around is bloody irresponsible! Read my lips! ﻿I'm sorry. I'll go to jail if I get the kid killed! ﻿I'll go to jail if I get the kid killed! ﻿Is everything alright? ﻿Sorry for my boy's indiscretion. ﻿Sorry. Did you hurt yourself? ﻿You scared me. How many times have I told you? ﻿Never wander off! ﻿You almost get us killed. See? ﻿Buddy, ﻿apologise to Papa. ﻿No, no way! ﻿You're a badass! - You promised! - What did you say? ﻿You promised ﻿To take us to see Godzilla in Japan! ﻿Then you promised me the Lake Tian Monster. ﻿Don't hold me back! ﻿I don't like you! ﻿I hate you! ﻿You brat! ﻿Brat! Stop it! ﻿Get back in the car! ﻿Get in! ﻿This is too much. I'll teach him a lesson. ﻿What's the point of all these? ﻿Drive around. ﻿Mama, I can't hold it anymore. ﻿Okay. ﻿Find her a toilet quickly. ﻿It'll be fine in a few minutes. ﻿Come on, honey. ﻿Get going. ﻿Come. ﻿Be'careful. Excuse me, where can I find a toilet? ﻿Lele. ﻿Lele! ﻿You're pardoned! ﻿Lele. ﻿No hide-and-seek. ﻿Lele! This is not funny. ﻿Okay. I apologise. ﻿Will you forgive me? ﻿Lele? ﻿Don't be mad at me. ﻿Lele! ﻿Lele! ﻿Lele! ﻿Have you got him? Hurry up, the girl is hungry. The boy's gone! ﻿What? ﻿Then go find him! Don't worry. I'm on it. ﻿Lele! - His name's Lele, right? - Lele. ﻿Where did you lose him? Along the way. ﻿I know it's along the way. ﻿But where exactly? ﻿It's... a small trail up the mountain. ﻿Look. This spot ﻿is our police station. ﻿Try to gauge where you lost him. Erh... ﻿Which is that...? ﻿So only three people drove there? ﻿Yes. ﻿The officer was asking me ﻿where we’d lost Lele. ﻿Does the trail has a name? ﻿I have no idea. ﻿I've just checked. ﻿Your kid ﻿was lost at Qi's forest farm. ﻿Qi's forest farm ﻿is right here on the map. ﻿See... Songhe Forest Farm. ﻿Right. ﻿Remember where the car broke down? ﻿There's a metal tower nearby. ﻿Yes. ﻿It was... ﻿the watchtower ﻿Who are you? ﻿I am the boy's father. ﻿I looked all over, but... I propose... ﻿we do a sweeping search. ﻿Can you do a sweep? ﻿I need to assess the situation first. ﻿I don't even know what we're looking for! ﻿How did you lose him? ﻿Our car broke down ﻿close to the watchtower. ﻿And we got out of the car... ﻿Qi told me everything, ﻿that the three of you drove to his farm ﻿without the boy. ﻿We were looking for a toilet... ﻿And he drove off on his own? ﻿He went back for our son. ﻿In another word, ﻿on your way to the farm ﻿you have already lost the boy? - And then... - It was near the tower... ﻿after dropping you off at the farm, ﻿he went back alone for the boy. ﻿Correct? ﻿Yes. ﻿My wife has already told you ﻿we lost our son near the watchtower. ﻿Cut the bullshit! ﻿I need your help. ﻿Find our son ﻿will you? ﻿This southerner is so rude! ﻿Get a grip! ﻿We must follow the protocol. ﻿Why are you shouting at me? ﻿I’m not. I lost my child ﻿and I'm desperate. ﻿I bet! But we got to do this step by step. ﻿Now you're shouting. Am I really? ﻿- You have to understand... - Be reasonable. ﻿We must establish all the facts. ﻿Be reasonable, okay? ﻿It's pitch-black out there. Where do we even start? ﻿What happened? ﻿I asked you what happened. Why took so long taking a statement? ﻿I've never seen him before. ﻿Never, I'm sure. ﻿No ﻿Thank you. ﻿Here you go. Okay, thank you. Thank you so much. ﻿Just leave it over there. ﻿Thanks. Put it right there. ﻿Stand back! We're setting off fireworks! ﻿Chief. ﻿What's going on here? ﻿It's not the time to put on a show. ﻿Last year, ﻿a woman went to collect firewood. ﻿She also lost her way ﻿and couldn't get out. ﻿We set off fireworks right here. ﻿She saw them finally ﻿and came home all by herself. ﻿Chief, we got something. ﻿Had a good look? ﻿It's a deer. Let's call it a night. Roger that. ﻿Your daughter is fast asleep. ﻿You'd better take her back to the hotel. ﻿No, we can't go. ﻿Perhaps your son has already made it back. ﻿You go back first. ﻿Come on. ﻿Go on. Get in for a rest. ﻿How's it going? ﻿I'm exhausted. ﻿Chief, you should have a rest, too. ﻿I reckon we need to widen our search ﻿across two kilometres at least. Bullshit! ﻿We have not even covered one. Two kilometres? ﻿It will be goddamned dawn by then. ﻿What's going on? ﻿What's the matter? ﻿Let's have a respite. ﻿We can't sustain this physically. ﻿Tell everyone to rest where they are. ﻿What's going on? ﻿Your men are off to sleep. ﻿You aren't even trying! ﻿Do you understand respite? ﻿We've been at this non-stop since six. It's been over 20 hours. ﻿You have problem with us taking a break? ﻿Didn't I made myself clear? ﻿Respite! A short break, understand? ﻿My son... ﻿can't wait for a break. ﻿Do you want money? ﻿What kind of trash talk is that? ﻿What do you mean? ﻿I'll do it myself. ﻿I dare you to say it again! ﻿If I'm not in uniform, ﻿I would have kicked your butts! ﻿What's wrong with him? ﻿We've had enough trouble with his kid. ﻿If we lose him as well, ﻿it will be hell! ﻿Who does he think he is? Arrogant fool! ﻿Go after him now! ﻿Go! Buddy! Buddy! Buddy! ﻿Lele! ﻿Lele! ﻿Lele! ﻿I'm totally knackered. ﻿What do you think you're doing? ﻿You're messing up our operation. ﻿You're wasting valuable rescue time! ﻿You're nothing. ﻿He's only eight. ﻿At his age, ﻿in this weather, ﻿in such extreme cold, ﻿if he'd fallen into the water, ﻿how long could he survive? ﻿How long could he survive? ﻿Cover yourself with the blanket. Don't catch a cold. ﻿He's safe. ﻿Excuse me? Are you a tourist? ﻿Is there something bothering you? ﻿Actually, for something like this, ﻿you should turn to the Internet for help. ﻿Usually, when a case goes viral, ﻿netizens will pick it up quickly. ﻿Once it starts to trend, everything will be easy. ﻿Anyway, there's nothing more you can do. ﻿Shall I post it online for you? Well, but... ﻿Let's give it a try. ﻿Come on, ﻿let's add each other on WeChat. ﻿Gather a few photos ﻿and the boy's info, ﻿send them to me. ﻿Even stray cats and dogs ﻿could be found with the Internet's help, ﻿let alone a child! ﻿If I can't find Lele, ﻿you'll hate me forever! ﻿Calling HQ. Approaching 127.28 East, 41.42 North. ﻿Visibility is low. ﻿No visual ID so far. The golden window for rescue is 48 hours. ﻿The golden window for rescue is 48 hours. ﻿His chances will diminish after that. ﻿The boy has been missing for 15 hours. ﻿Without food and proper clothing... ﻿his clock is ticking. ﻿Be prepared! ﻿Okay, roger that. ﻿Careful with the comm devices. ﻿Yes, sir. ﻿Xiao Jiang. ﻿The bureau just called. ﻿Due to adverse weather, ﻿the helicopter has to abandon mission. ﻿What are you doing here? ﻿Captain. ﻿We're the parents. ﻿How do you do? ﻿This scarf belongs to Lele. ﻿It should have his body scent. ﻿It may help the search dogs. It's been washed! ﻿Yes, I did. ﻿I'm sorry. ﻿Can we still use it? ﻿Dongzi. ﻿I'm Xiao, captain of the Songhe SAR team. ﻿They're from Baiyun, a team of civilian SAR professionals. ﻿I'm in charge of this operation. ﻿Take us with you. ﻿Captain, ﻿no matter what happens to our kid, ﻿we want to be there as parents. ﻿Absolutely! ﻿Okay. ﻿You can come with us. ﻿But you must follow my orders. ﻿Of course. We will. ﻿Team One, to the east. ﻿Team Two, to the south. ﻿Team Three, to the north Team Three, to the north. ﻿Team Four, follow me to the west... ﻿Remember. ﻿Safety first! ﻿Safety first! ﻿Let's roll! ﻿Yes, sir! ﻿Lele! ﻿Lele! ﻿Lele! ﻿Lele! ﻿Lele! ﻿Captain. We’ve got something. ﻿Lele! ﻿Chief, we found ﻿The branches were snapped recently. And the ground has been trodden on. ﻿Could Lele have fallen into the pit? ﻿It's hard to tell. Mi. ﻿Prepare to descend. ﻿Is it Lele? ﻿I'll go down to check. ﻿Dead. ﻿It can't be. ﻿No, it can't be! ﻿No! No! ﻿Impossible! It can't be Lele! ﻿It's not Lele! ﻿It's not Lele! ﻿Alright! Stop it! - I'm going down! - Calm down! ﻿- Let me through! - Calm down, okay? ﻿We're not sure if it's your son. ﻿Go away! ﻿Stay back! ﻿You're mistaken. Calm down! ﻿You're mistaken. ﻿Go away! ﻿Please tell me, ﻿it's not my son. ﻿Say it! It's a wolf. ﻿It's not Lele. ﻿It's a wolf. ﻿It's a wolf. ﻿It's a wolf. ﻿It's a wolf. It is just a wolf! ﻿A dozen people from other teams just arrived. ﻿They'll be under your field command. ﻿Tell them to meet us by the river. ﻿The road to Lake Tian ﻿is closed off here. ﻿We'll continue our search downstream. ﻿Let's divide into three or our teams. ﻿Lele said he was going to Lake Tian. How do know that? ﻿Because I promised to take him ﻿to see the Lake Tian Monster. ﻿We'll stick with my plan. Let'﻿s look downstream. ﻿Can't you spare a team there? ﻿Come on... ﻿Just look at how wide the river is. ﻿You won't be able to cross it, ﻿let alone your child. ﻿We can’t go on a wild goose chase, ﻿wasting our resources. ﻿Have faith in our professional judgment. ﻿What if I could find some clues? ﻿I want to see the Lake Tian Monster. ﻿What's the matter with you? ﻿Take three men with you. ﻿Let Rumeng... ﻿Mi! Help me with it. ﻿Come back! ﻿Come back! ﻿Come on out! ﻿One! ﻿Two! ﻿I'll teach him a lesson. ﻿What's the point of all these? ﻿Let's drive around and come back. ﻿Drive around. ﻿Leave him alone in there. ﻿He needs a lesson. I heard... something! ﻿Did you hear it? ﻿I heard my son, ﻿he's calling me. ﻿Don't wander off. ﻿Don't wander off. ﻿Lele. ﻿Papa is coming for you. The down jacket. Minxuan! The down jacket! ﻿It's Lele's jacket. ﻿The down jacket. ﻿Look. ﻿It's probably his! ﻿Cut this out! ﻿Stop linking everything to your son! ﻿Throw it away, okay? ﻿Unbelievable! ﻿Let me have a look. ﻿Stick with the plan. ﻿Keep searching downstream. ﻿No! ﻿No! ﻿My instinct tells me... ﻿Lele wouldn't go downstream. He would have headed for Lake Tian. ﻿I know he would... ﻿I'm sure he would. ﻿Pack your gears. - Keep searching... - No. ﻿Stop packing! Minxuan... ﻿Don't let them go downstream! No! ﻿Give me! ﻿Captain Xiao. Captain, please trust my husband. ﻿Lele must have headed for Lake Tian. ﻿I gave him a good smack. ﻿He felt wronged ﻿and ran inside a hut. I just wanted... ﻿to teach him a lesson. ﻿I went back five minutes later. ﻿But he was gone already. ﻿It was my fault. ﻿Are you nuts? ﻿You're wasting precious rescue time! ﻿Dongzi, calm down! ﻿Cool it! ﻿What the heck do you want? ﻿Calm down! ﻿I deserve it. ﻿Give me the walkie-talkie. ﻿Let's split into two groups. ﻿The first ﻿continues the search downstream. The second goes uphill. ﻿Mama. ﻿I'm saving this for Lele. ﻿He loves a chicken burger. ﻿Where's Lele? ﻿Lele... ﻿He will be back soon. I ﻿was starving so I ate half of it. ﻿Will Lele be mad at me? ﻿Why would he? ﻿No, he won't. ﻿Do you know ﻿how much Papa loves you and Lele? ﻿Really? ﻿Give Papa a big hug. ﻿Excuse me.. ﻿I'm sorry. ﻿Here. ﻿Look. ﻿Many people posted online that they'd seen Lele. ﻿Check this out! ﻿Captain! Captain! We got news. Look... ﻿One said he’d seen Lele at Qianjiang Valley. ﻿Someone else spotted him at the Holy Matriach's Temple... ﻿Do you know where Qianjiang Valley is? ﻿Let's go! ﻿It’s on the border. ﻿We're talking about a child here. ﻿To get there, even adults like us need a day. ﻿And the Holy Matriach's Temple? ﻿We call this baloney where I come from! ﻿I have never heard of it. ﻿Perhaps he was talking about ﻿the other Lake Tian in the northwest! ﻿- Minxuan, get in! - What are you doing? ﻿- I just wanted to ask... - Get in! ﻿Get in! -Get out! ﻿Why did you pull him? ﻿You call that pulling? ﻿Stop taking things out of context! ﻿So you believe everything online? ﻿Okay. ﻿I can write a story and post it online, too. ﻿I'd say you abused your child ﻿by abandoning him in a snowy forest. ﻿You even took away his scarf. ﻿Do you buy this? ﻿Look! ﻿It's escalating... ﻿The story has gone viral like wildfire! ﻿Look. ﻿Stories about the missing kid are trending. ﻿They're a bunch of trolls, ﻿having nothing better to do. ﻿Captain Qian's in trouble! ﻿What's wrong? ﻿Minxuan, get in! ﻿- I just wanted to ask... - Get in! ﻿Get in! -Get out! ﻿So you believe everything online? ﻿I'd say you abused your child ﻿by bandoning him in a snowy forest. ﻿You even took away his scarf. ﻿﻿You even took away his scarf. Do you buy this? ﻿£ f«lkh il	1+ k Ije H What baloney were you talking about? ﻿What's that for? Look at you. ﻿What do you want? ﻿Why do you think I was talking baloney? ﻿You know the kind of person I am. I never tell a lie. ﻿He’s been braking a fool of us from day one. ﻿We wasted a whole day for nothing. ﻿I'm telling you. ﻿You'll be in deep shit ﻿sooner or later. ﻿He's coming. ﻿Let's go! ﻿Captain, we're from Notease News. ﻿We have a few questions. ﻿As an officer, you confronted the victim's family. ﻿How do you explain this? ﻿Okay, okay. ﻿Look, let them continue the search. ﻿I'm in charge here. ﻿I can answer your questions. ﻿Chief. ﻿Why did you condone your subordinate ﻿to conflict with the victim's family ﻿Conflict? ﻿Let me answer. ﻿How can there be conflict? ﻿Chief, can I say something? ﻿It's a misunderstanding. ﻿Can I say a few words? ﻿Let me tell you something. ﻿As journalists, ﻿you must report the facts! ﻿What are the facts? ﻿Yes, do tell! Did you question his attitude? ﻿Did you ask him how he treated his son? ﻿Please explain yourself. ﻿I don't owe you any explanation. ﻿I have made myself clear already. ﻿He abandoned his sg . ﻿And he's blaming us for it. ﻿Does it make sense? ﻿Wait! ﻿Please tell us more. ﻿Well... Look.. ﻿He's coming... ﻿Go ask them about it. ﻿Let's go! ﻿Come on... ﻿Sir! ﻿- Lock the door. - Can you give us an interview? ﻿Can you tell us something? ﻿Please tell us something. ﻿Sir! ﻿Sir! ﻿Stop taking pictures of my child! ﻿What are you doing? ﻿Is it true what the captain said? ﻿Did you really throw the child away? ﻿Are you his wife? ﻿Do you know the whole thing? ﻿Are you worried now? ﻿No camera! ﻿How did the child disappear? ﻿Is the weather so cold enough for children ﻿Do you have anything to say about the previous video? ﻿Don't rob my camera. ﻿Don't be impulsive. Give me back the camera first. ﻿And the video... ﻿Do you have anything to explain ﻿Tell us about it ﻿What's the matter? Are you okay? ﻿You've gone too far! ﻿Let's all calm down. Stop filming. ﻿Everyone except the search team please leave! ﻿Take her to the hospital at once. ﻿Yes, sir. ﻿I'll say this up front. ﻿This is a matter of life and death. ﻿Anyone who interferes with the operation ﻿will be held accountable! ﻿Resume the search! ﻿- Sure. - Yes, sir. ﻿Now, hold it yourself. ﻿Did I do something wrong? ﻿Shush. ﻿Was I wrong in everything I did ﻿and every decision I made? ﻿This case is getting a lot of attention. ﻿Our superiors are taking it seriously. ﻿Tell me. What on earth happened? Director, you mustn't believe online rumours. ﻿The fact is that this man ﻿dumped his kid along the way. ﻿Did you take this statement? ﻿Why it doesn't say what you just said? ﻿In this state of mind, ﻿you're not fit for this operation. ﻿Return to the station. ﻿Did you buy the wrong phone case? ﻿Look. ﻿It doesn't fit. ﻿Have you thought about it? ﻿Papa's coming! Get up there! ﻿Hurry up! ﻿Don't let Papa find us. ﻿Lele! ﻿Now everyone is saying ﻿that he had killed his child. ﻿Ignore those online horseshit. ﻿But even if they're horseshit, ﻿it's already beeft two days. ﻿Not even an adult could survive, ﻿let alone a child. ﻿Even if we can't save him, ﻿we must recover his body. ﻿The most talked-about topic ﻿is the boy who has gone missing. ﻿In fact, people have started to raise doubts ﻿about the boy's disappearance. ﻿Perhaps his parents could give us an explanation. ﻿Perhaps his parents could give us an explanation. ﻿Papa, you are on television! ﻿By leaving a child alone in the wilds, ﻿was it to educate ﻿or to punish? ﻿What on earth ﻿made a father do this? ﻿As parents, should we all ﻿reflect on our attitudes ﻿towards educating our offspring? ﻿What are you filming? ﻿The director is speaking with your wife. ﻿Please wait. ﻿You can take a seat over here. ﻿Has your husband ever hit your son at home? ﻿Hard? ﻿Once in a while. ﻿When Lele got on his nerves ﻿he will get physical. ﻿But every time he did, ﻿he'd be remorseful afterwards. ﻿Whenever he got mad, ﻿how did he calm down? ﻿I'd talk to him. ﻿After a while, he'd be fine. ﻿But what if you're not there? ﻿Erh... ﻿What if I'm not there? ﻿Mama. ﻿Honey. ﻿I brought you some iced tea. ﻿Goa your brother to join. ﻿Lele. ﻿I got you some iced tea. ﻿Lele? ﻿Lele? ﻿Where is the boy? ﻿What time is it? ﻿Didn't I ask you to pick him up from Xixi's? ﻿Oh, I forgot. ﻿You didn't go? ﻿Xixi's mom? ﻿Is Lele still with you? ﻿No. She said he'd left when you didn't show up. She said he'd left when you didn't show up. ﻿I'll go find him. ﻿But where? ﻿He's back. ﻿Brat where did you go? ﻿Where have you been? ﻿What happened to your arm? ﻿What happened? ﻿You had us really worried ﻿I tripped over on my way ome. ﻿Don't run off the next time. ﻿Lele is a big boy now. ﻿He needs more than my company ﻿on many different things. ﻿During weekends, ﻿he runs, plays basketball or football. ﻿These are the things ﻿that I don't manage well. ﻿So I guess... ﻿he may need his father's company more. ﻿Did your husband drive off ﻿to pick up your son alone? ﻿Yes, he went off on his own. ﻿That is to say, ﻿whatever happened later, ﻿you were not present. ﻿Did you do this on purpose? ﻿What are you saying? ﻿Because you don't need us. ﻿You're more content on your own, ﻿aren't you? ﻿What are you saying? ﻿You are always like that at home. ﻿You.. ﻿Either rage or keep mum. ﻿Why don't you say something? ﻿Mama I'm done. ﻿I don't care about you anymore. ﻿We'll take a cab ourselves. ﻿We've got your kid. Bring $100,000 to the market! ﻿Come alone. Call the police and your boy's dead. ﻿Move your ass! ﻿Get in! ﻿Get in! ﻿Here you are. ﻿Got the money with you? ﻿Where's my kid? ﻿Bring him in. ﻿No! ﻿How can you do this? ﻿Bastards! ﻿Lele! Don't be afraid! ﻿Papa's here for you. ﻿Open it! ﻿Money! ﻿Open it! ﻿I've got to see ﻿if it's my son. ﻿Give us the money! Give us the money! ﻿Stop! ﻿How could you? ﻿Here. ﻿It's all yours. ﻿Let the boy go, okay? ﻿Let's go. ﻿Let him go! ﻿You bastards! ﻿Give me back my boy! ﻿What are you doing? ﻿Don't move! ﻿Arrest them! ﻿Sir! ﻿Don't move! ﻿It's alright. ﻿It's alright. ﻿It's alright. ﻿It's alright. ﻿We'll take them back for questioning. ﻿The abducted kid is from the next county. ﻿When did you know ﻿that he's not your son? ﻿I knew once I heard him. ﻿Not bad. ﻿You bit the bullet ﻿and never let go. You've got guts. ﻿I'm sure his parents want him back. ﻿As much as I want mine. You're not such a bad guy ﻿except for your blabbermouth. ﻿Know what a blabbermouth is? ﻿It takes one to know one. But what brought you here? I was tasked to keep an eye on you. ﻿It's snowing too heavily now, ﻿suspend the search and return to base camp. ﻿Let me take you back to your hotel. ﻿No. ﻿I'm going to base camp. ﻿Let's resume tomorrow. ﻿This team has gone around... ﻿in circles. ﻿It should take another route. I want them to... ﻿You can't stop. ﻿Please don't stop. It's gusty outside. ﻿The temperature is plummeting. ﻿It's dark and dangerous. ﻿We have to suspend operation. ﻿There's no way a kid could walk to Lake Tian. ﻿Even tough guys couldn't withstand this weather. ﻿Does it matter if it's a man or a kid? ﻿I think he knows perfectly well ﻿the fate of the kid. ﻿Leaving the kid alone in the wilds ﻿in icy condition. How could parents have the heart to do this? ﻿His young life ﻿has just started to blossom. ﻿I beg you ﻿give my son Lele ﻿another chance, ﻿okay? ﻿Please ﻿I'm begging you. ﻿No... ﻿Get up... What are you doing? ﻿It’s not over. Get up. ﻿Come on. Get up. ﻿Get up... ﻿Listen... ﻿Whether we want to continue, ﻿let's vote ﻿by a show of hands. ﻿I’m not going. ﻿It's a waste of time. ﻿You're all coming along, right? ﻿Count me out. ﻿Look, ﻿Erh.. ﻿those who didn't raise their hands ﻿will continue the search. ﻿Those who raised theirs ﻿can go home now. ﻿Don't worry. ﻿No one can blame you. ﻿Really. ﻿Chief. ﻿Perhaps he's been pulling our legs all along. ﻿You've said so yourself. ﻿It's possible. ﻿It's also possible that the kid is still alive. ﻿In this weather, ﻿how long can a kid last out there? ﻿Thirty years ago, in weather just like this, ﻿three kids ﻿lost their way in the forest. ﻿Their parents called the police. ﻿We mobilised every officer. And they were joined ﻿by folks from nearby villages. ﻿We searched for three days and nights. Finally, ﻿we found one of the boys. ﻿Alive? ﻿Alive. ﻿But at that very moment, the blizzard worsen. ﻿Everyone was exhausted, ﻿and couldn't continue. ﻿Everyone was saying, ﻿in total darkness, ﻿there was no hope. ﻿That we should quit. Did you? ﻿We left. ﻿The very next morning, ﻿our comrades ﻿found the two kids' bodies. ﻿Just 30 meters away ﻿from where we stopped. ﻿Thirty meters. If we hadn't given up so soon, ﻿perhaps the two boys... ﻿could have been found. ﻿The sole survivor that day is now among us ﻿That's me. ﻿The pledges ﻿are still echoing in me. Keeping our faith ﻿against time. ﻿In the biting blizzard, in the frozen world. ﻿Oh, goodbye, my friend. Goodbye. Goodbye. ﻿Moving our tired bodies forward without fear. ﻿forward without fear. ﻿Bravely breaching danger. ﻿Yesterday we didn't ﻿have time to say farewell. Oh, goodbye, my friend. Goodbye. Goodbye. ﻿Until the day ﻿we meet at the finishing line. ﻿And talk about the past, with smiles and wine. Oh, goodbye, my friend. ﻿Oh, goodbye, my friend. ﻿Goodbye. Goodbye. ﻿Move our tired bodies ﻿forward without fear. ﻿Bravely breaching danger. Oh. goodbye, my friend. ﻿Oh, goodbye, my friend. Goodbye. Goodbye. Th﻿e pledges are still echoing in me. ﻿Keeping our faith against time. In the biting blizzard, ﻿in the frozen world (Oh, goodbye, my friend). ﻿Goodbye. Goodbye. ﻿Moving our tired bodies ﻿forward without fear. ﻿Bravely breaching danger. ﻿Moving our tired bodies ﻿forward without fear. ﻿Bravely breaching danger. ﻿What's wrong? ﻿Captain. ﻿We couldn't find any track in the snow. ﻿Chief. ﻿None of the team has managed ﻿to find human tracks in the snow. ﻿That's to say... - Chief, it's for you. ﻿It's impossible that the kid could've walked on! ﻿There must be another path! ﻿We have searched all over. ﻿The point is, ﻿as long as someone has walked by, ﻿he would have left tracks behind. ﻿You can't miss them. ﻿No matter how heavy it snows, ﻿their tracks cannot be fully covered. I just heard from the hospital. ﻿A Shanghainese man just came out of a coma. His car rolled over near Lake Huang, ﻿and suffered head injury. ﻿He crawled to safety by himself ﻿and was taken to the hospital by a passing car. According to him, ﻿two days ago around 7 pm, ﻿he picked up an unconscious kid near Houxia Road. ﻿It's Lele! ﻿The kid could still be inside the car. ﻿It's our only hope. I suggest ﻿we find out where the man was picked up. ﻿Look, tell everyone ﻿to proceed to the new target! ﻿Let's go! ﻿Yes, sir! Oh, goodbye, my friend. ﻿Oh, goodbye, my friend. ﻿Goodbye. Goodbye. ﻿Until the day ﻿we meet at the finishing line. ﻿And talk about the past, with smiles and wine. ﻿Until the day ﻿we meet at the finishing line. ﻿And talk about the past, with smiles and wine. ﻿This is Lake Huang. ﻿We’ve combed the area. ﻿We couldn't find your kid. Lake Huang ﻿has another shore. ﻿Do we go over the lake? ﻿Or around it? It's hard crossing over. ﻿Let's go around it. ﻿Okay. ﻿Attention, all teams. ﻿To'the south slope. ﻿Gather our gears. ﻿Prepare are to leave. Let's go... ﻿We're ready to go. ﻿Here we go. ﻿Did you hear that? ﻿An avalanche! Run! ﻿Stretch the formation! ﻿Go either side! ﻿Go either side! ﻿Go either side! ﻿Run! ﻿Go either side! ﻿Run! ﻿Run! ﻿Go! ﻿Quick! ﻿Hide underneath a rock! ﻿Let go! ﻿You have to live! ﻿Chief! ﻿Captain. Captain. Are you okay? ﻿Go find the others. Go help the others. ﻿There's someone here. Chao, Chao, ﻿come check it out. ﻿Keep looking. ﻿Chief! ﻿Chief! ﻿Captain! Chief! Chief! The temperature is now minus 31. Wind direction 320 degrees, wind speed 3 m/s. Wind direction 320 degrees, wind speed 3 m/s. Approaching target. Prepare to land. ﻿There's someone here! Come on! ﻿Come on, dig! ﻿Harder! ﻿One.two,three,come on! ﻿One,two,three,come on! ﻿One,two,three! ﻿Pull him out! ﻿One,two,three! ﻿We're airlifting a badly-injured over. Alert the hospital. ﻿Director. ﻿We have found most of us. ﻿Many of them are hurt. ﻿We may have to send them to hospital in batches. ﻿Okay. ﻿But chief and his father haven't found them yet. ﻿What's wrong? ﻿What is it? ﻿The Chief... ﻿is gone. ﻿Cut the crap. ﻿Chief! ﻿Mr Bai! ﻿Chief! ﻿Chief! ﻿Get up, we still have a job to do.
