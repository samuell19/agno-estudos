(foreboding music) (helicopter blades whirring) (machine gun firing) (guns firing) (yelling) (exploding) - [Narrator] Vietnam. Perhaps one of the darkest moments in American history. An undeclared war leaving 50,000 American service men and women dead. Their average age only 19 years old. (guns firing) When it was all over, there was still another casualty of this war, American MIAs. Over 2500 missing in action men and women never accounted for. (helicopter exploding) This is the story of one of those men, Kevin J. Pendleton, second lieutenant, first air cavalry. - Come back, come back! - [Narrator] Official classification, missing in action. - Fuck, man! Why the fuck did they leave us here? Sergeant! Sergeant! - [Narrator] To some he was gone forever but to his father, it was only a matter of time before he tracked down and rescued his son. - Why did they fucking leave us here? (mumbling) - Your accent sucks, honky. Shit. - [Cop] Let's check that place out. - I'll take the lot. - The rest is in the back. - [Cop] Hey Jack, this van's carrying fake plates. - [Jack] No shit? Call it in. I'm gonna go inside and check this out. (gun firing) (dramatic music) (guns firing) (groaning) (glass shattering) (sirens blaring) (grunting) - Shit! (guns firing) - Hold your fire! (helicopter blades whirring) (shouting) (tires squealing) - Hold it, police! (guns firing) (siren wailing) (horn honking) (tires squealing) - My father's place. (chattering) (horn honking) (siren wailing) - Earl, what are you doing here? Wait, get away from my son! Hey, come back here! (dramatic music) (siren wailing) (brakes screeching) (gun firing) (shouting) (guns firing) - [Male] Going to the roof! Carl, Carl! Carl, where are you? Be careful, don't be a fool! - [Male Two] It's alright! (gun firing) (grunting) (guns firing) (siren wailing) - Shit! - Alright, give it up, man. Alright? Okay, look. Look around you. It's all over. Now you be cool and you give me that briefcase. (groaning) (strikes impacting) (grunting) - Alright, toss your gun behind you and come out with your hands up where I can see 'em. - I quit, copper! I quit! (grunting) (suspenseful music) (metal clanking) (yelling) (radio chattering) - [Male] Look, on the roof! - Carl. Carl! (yelling) (grunting) (grunting) - No! - Don't let go! Don't let go! - [Cop] Oh my god, hold on! (screaming) - [Male] Oh, Carl! Carl. God. (gun firing) Killed my son, you bastard! (groaning) - He damn near killed me. (siren wailing) - [Radio] We got a code 12 in a jewelry store on 10. Any units in the area please respond. - Can't do this to me. Breathe. Get some help! - Get the fuck off my leg. Get the fuck off my leg! - You son of a bitch. - You gonna sit there let me bleed to fucking death or what? - LAPD Detective Brad Spyder hugs the limelight again even as he faces a senate probe investigating his unorthodox police tactics. The no holds barred crime buster has caused a diplomatic stir. This time crashing a cocktail party-- - You just caused one god damn international incident, hot shot, and you'd better have a good excuse. - [Brad] I'm a cop, I bust crooks, and I don't stop to ask for pedigrees. That punk was slime. - Well listen, Spyder. You're a good cop. You're a little weird but you get results and I like that but you've got to understand, when you get into this society shit, you've got to change your methods, you know? That's just the way it is. - Okay, I'll tell you what I'll do, chief. Why don't you run down there to Frederick's on Hollywood an requisition me a pair of those velvet handcuffs they got? Then I can start making Beverly Hills bust just the way you like 'em. - God damn it, Spider, you know the ambassador's residence is out of bounds. You had no damn business being at the place at all. - I was chasing a crook! - A suspect, Spyder, a suspect! - The suspect was armed and dangerous. Stokes has got a hole in his leg to prove it. - Now look here, lad. I'm on your side, you know? - You're on my side? Fuck that! You're saying it's cool for these shit heads to run around putting holes in my partner? - [Chief] Get out! (metal clanking) (speaking in foreign language) (men chattering) (tense music) (rocket exploding) (yelling) (rockets exploding) (guns firing) (screaming) (explosions rocking) (shouting) (yelling) (screaming) (groaning) (guns firing) - Excellent. That's what I call precision. Area secure in three minutes. With this team of specialists, will have no trouble getting in and out of Vietnam. - [Male] Hey wait. You said there was something else you wanted to tell me. - His name is Jeffrey Stokes, first air cavalry. You probably have a file on him. - [Male] You brought a man out? - Yeah. As you know, we have two scavving teams in the field right now. Five days ago, one of them got lucky. They ran into a prisoner transfer. They got a man out. - Did he see Kevin? - It's very, very possible, Mr. Pendleton. Two months ago, another prisoner was brought through Stokes' reeducation camp. Camp commander said he was a chopper pilot and the son of a quote leading exploiter of the masses, unquote. If what this prisoner Stokes says is true and your son Kevin is alive then we'll have to move fast. As you can see, my men are ready. All we need from you is the cash. (yelling) - This was real. This wasn't just a drill. - A drill? Hell no. If you wanna know how a man reacts under fire, you test him under fire. Mr. Pendleton, understand something. If we're gonna get your son back, there will be sacrifices, there will be casualties on both sides. Now never mind about these men. They were all illegal entrants, taking a risk on a phony visa. Since nobody knows they're here, no one's gonna come looking for them. Now there's the POW Stokes. Remember, this man has been in a prison camp for almost 12 years, a lot of it under intense hardship. Interrogations. He's in pretty bad shape. He doesn't completely understand that he's out. He doesn't take questioning well. It brings back a lot of memories, you know. Take it easy on him, please. (whimpering) - I'm Roderick Pendleton. I understand-- - They told me you sent them in. Thanks. Thank you. - Have you seen my son? - Yeah, yeah, I've seen him. They brought him through. North. Tall man. - Blonde. - Shaved head. But pride. He still had pride. Get me out of here. You gotta get me out of here, help me! - You are home! He's losing it, man. - [Roderick] Alright, let him rest. - Come on, come on, come on. - What's gonna happen to him? - We've gotta keep him away from the media, for his sake and for ours. - Money's not a problem just as long as you can assure me-- - That man is home safe. If he's one of us, we'll take care of him. Kevin's the next target. Our teams are pinpointing the location. The men are primed. But cash is gonna be moving fast now. - Money will be there any time you need it. Thank you, Mr. Friedkin. - No thanks needed. I don't believe that boys who've fought for their country should be left to rot in some god damn cesspool any more than you do. - I did everything you told me, god damn it! I did my part! And he believed me. You know he did. - You make me sick. (whimpering) (guns firing) Come on, he's getting away! Damn it, find him, find him! And don't come back without him! - You see him? - Nothing, man. Fucker's gone. - How's the old fart? - Oh, much better. (mumbling) - Yeah, he'll never change. - Hey partner, what's up? How you surviving the wrath of the dickless Irish? - Man, one of these days that sucker's gonna sit down so hard, he's gonna ram that (mumbling) right up through the top of his head. Yeah. - [Brad] So tell me, man, what's up? - Nothing but the leg. - Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you know. But man, he really pissed me off this time. You're sitting there with a hole in your leg. - Oh, now don't put me in it and don't be feeling sorry for me. I got a month's paid vacation. I got my lady right here beside me and a cold beer in my hand. I'm having the time of my life. The only person I feel sorry for is your new partner 'cause that man's in a world of shit. - You guys must be hungry. Table's ready. - Want something to eat, man? - [Brad] Here, let me help you up. (shouting) (suspenseful music) - Hey man, what is it? What's wrong? I mean I just was going over to see some people, you know, maybe do a little bit of business here? - Shut up. Guy's gonna come looking for you. A black guy by the name of Jeff Stokes. He's gonna want a fix. You give it to him. And then you follow him. I wanna know where he is. - It's cool, man, no problem with me but I never even seen this Stokes dude before, man. I don't even know what he looks like. - You're a dealer. He's a junkie. He'll find you. (phone ringing) - Hello. - [Female] Collect call for Mr. Lee Stokes. - Hold on, please. It's for you, collect. - Yes? - [Female] Collect call from Mr. Jeff Stokes in Hawaii. - Hawaii? Who? - [Female] Mr. Jeff Stokes. - Wait a minute, that must be some kind of mistake. - [Female] Will you accept the charges, sir? - Yeah, I'll accept the charges. - [Jeff] There's no time to explain, little bro. - Now who in the hell is-- - It's me, little bro. Help me. (mumbling) The high school dance. (mumbling) You remember them all, don't you? - Jeff. - They got me listed as missing in action but I'm in worse shit than that. Some guys are out to get me and I need your help. Get a room at the Palm View Hotel. (mumbling) district. - Wait a minute, Jeff. - Lee, what's the matter? Who was it, honey? - [Cop] Hey Brad. - I'll take care of these guys. - [Cop] You'd better get in touch with headquarters. Lee's wife's on the phone. She says it's urgent. - Yeah, Spyder, I heard I had a call. - [Radio] I'll patch you through. - Oh Brad, you've got to do something. It's Lee. I think he's in trouble. - Where? - He got a telephone call from Hawaii, his brother. Said he needed Lee. He's gone to the airport. - Alright, I'll see what I can do. (dramatic music) Hey Stokes! Hey Stokes! What the hell do you think you're doing, man? - Leave me alone, Brad. This ain't none of your business. - It's none of my business? You're my partner for Christ sakes. You're running around here with a god damn hole in your leg chasing some crazy ass story about your brother still being alive. Your brother's dead, man. He ain't coming back. It ain't anybody coming back from Nam anymore. - He called me, man. It was him and there's things that he said that nobody else could know. He's in trouble and I'm going. - Wait a minute, man. - Stay out of it, man. Now that's the way it's gotta be. - [Male] Hurry up, will you? (whispering) - Boys. You picked the wrong night to steal a car. (grunting) (upbeat music) - Fill in for me. I've got some (mumbling). (chattering) You looking for me, man? - Skinner. What is the story on Stokes? We've got every dealer on this damn island on our payroll and I'm not getting any results. - Relax. We got him. - Where? - Good just called and he's gonna meet us at (mumbling) right now. - That's better. - He's been moving around a lot. Mostly in the docks. What's the problem, Sid? Soon as he finds out where he's staying, I'll go kill the prick. - I don't want him anywhere near Pendleton, do you understand? This whole operation rests on the old man. He's giving us his money, his resources, his name. Any damn thing we want because he believes we can get his son back. Okay, that's the beauty of this deal. He needs us but the man's not stupid, Skinner. The minute he loses faith in us, we lose the score of a fucking lifetime. You got that? - I'll take care of it. - You do that. (downbeat music) (phone ringing) - Yo Jeff. - Lee, little bro. What room are you in? - It's 209. Hey! (knocking) - Lock the door! Lock the fucking door! - Okay, man. The hell happened to you, man? - [Jeff] Little bro. - It's alright, man. - [Jeff] It's good to see you, little bro. - It's alright. (mumbling) Man, what's going on? They listed you missing in action. I thought you were dead. - It's a lie, little brother. It's all a fucking lie. A big lie. It was terrible, little brother. They would drop us deep behind enemy lines. There was no back up, no support. The jungle was thick and you could barely make it through. A lot of men were captured and they were thrown into soviet style camps. I wasn't gonna let it happen to me so I ran away and I've been hiding in Vietnam for the last 10 years, shooting junk trying to forget. Then these cats approached me. Said they could bring me home. All I had to do was pretend I was a POW in front of this rich old man. I did what they wanted but it was all a set up. They were gonna kill me so I ran away. I had to get out. I just couldn't take it anymore. They're here! - Who, man? The army? Hell, man, the war is over. They can't do nothing to you now. (knocking) - Oh Christ, they're here! We're dead, they're gonna kill us! No, bro, I killed you! I killed you! - We'll see about that. - Open up in there! (yelling) (gun firing) (machine gun firing) Jeff, get out of here! I said get out of here! Go to the side window! (guns firing) Alright, drop it! Now, motherfucker! Now! Turn around and put your hands against the wall! I said put your hands against the wall! (grunting) (groaning) (shouting) Who sent you? Who the fuck sent you, man? - [Man] I ain't talking. (gun firing) (gasping) (guns firing) (guns firing) (groaning) (gun firing) - Hey, you all look hungry today. What do you say we have a party? (chattering) (mumbling) Is there a big party? What do you say? - What the hell was Lee Stokes doing in Hawaii? - What happened? - He's dead. They found him in a fucking hotel room in the big island. Some maniacs had cut him to pieces with automatic fire and the cops found half a bag of pure heroin in his suitcase. - No way, chief, no fucking way! - I'm waiting for you to tell me what he was doing there. - Yeah, he got a phone call and said it was his brother. - His brother's probably dead and buried in Vietnam. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, I've heard all that, okay? Stokes said the guy told him things no one else would know except his brother. The guy said that he was in Hawaii and needed help so Lee went. - Shit, I tell that to the press and they laugh me off the force. - Yeah, well I tell you what. You can tell them one thing. You tell 'em Lee Stokes is no drug runner. - [Chief] Well where the hell are you going? - [Brad] I'm going to Hawaii. - [Announcer] Hawaiian airlines flight 301 for Honolulu. (mumbling) Now boarding (mumbling). (dramatic music) - That was a terrible thing. You've no idea how frightened I was. - You didn't happen to see anything? - Oh, I didn't see nothing. We were all so scared we were hiding under the beds like a bunch of idiots. - Boy, they sure made a hell of a mess, didn't they? - Terrible thing. Those poor men. - [Brad] I thought there was only one. - That's what they all said. They only took out one body. Those guys with the masks, they took out the wrong guys. They could have taken out the policeman's friend. Five seconds before that whole thing happened, I was walking down the hallway out there doing my rounds and I heard them talking through the door to (mumbling). - There was two of 'em? - Well that's what I said. I told them that all afternoon and nobody listened. Nobody believes Emma Houston anymore, they think I've been drinking again. - Thanks Emma. - What is this word, is that shift? Yo. - Hi, what can we do for you? - Brad Spyder, LAPD. - You know, Spyder, like the bug. - Hey, I bet you came about that guy who got killed, right? - Yeah, you're right. - Listen, can I see your badge? Gotta check it. - Yeah, it's mandatory we check up on cases like this. If there's anything you can tell me, any information that you have, it sure would help. - Well I typed up the case report. (shouting) - Weren't you just leaving for lunch? - Yeah, chief. - You, in here. - Thanks. - They don't call him the Samoan gorilla for nothing. - Brad Spyder, internal affairs. - Internal affairs my ass. You're here about that drug pushing cop. - Hey now, that was my partner and somebody set him up and there's a hell of a lot more going on here than you know about. - I know every god damn thing that goes on here. - Yeah, and I know Lee Stokes had no drug connections. - Your boss says you're a smart ass. He's right. - I got the source that said there were two people in that room. - Bullshit. You've been talking to old Ms. Houston who for your information has been drunk for the past 10 years. She sees flying saucers twice a month for Christ sake and let me tell you something, Howie, there was blood of one type in that room. It's o positive, Lee Stokes. - Hey, Spyder. Ted Kanaka. So, how'd it go with the chief? Real hard ass, huh? Yeah, he's always on my case. But it's nothing like LA though. - LA can be a tough town. - [Ted] Must be really heavy. - Heavy. - There's a guy named Weasel. Everybody knows he deals smack. I think even the chief knows but he doesn't wanna touch 'em 'cause he's afraid of finding out who he's dealing to. Chief's kind of, you know, political. - Weasel, huh? - Yeah, he hangs around at the eight ball club. He's got long hair, an earring, kind of skinny. Early 30's. I've been thinking about taking him out myself but I gotta be sure it's just right. Weasel's pretty tough. - You leave that shit for TV. It's a good way to get yourself killed. - Yeah, I guess you're right. Hey, where you going? - I got some questions that need answers. You take care of yourself, alright? (upbeat music) (chattering) Give me a beer. - Sure. You looking for somebody, mister? - Yeah. - He ain't here. - Heard a guy named Weasel hung out here. What time does he show up? - Once he finds out you're looking for him, I figure he ain't gonna show up at all. You're one of the (mumbling), I can tell. - He's got something I need. - Shit. Hey, yo. You don't wanna go poking around in here. It's gonna make a big hassle, cause big problems. Hey man, you ain't gonna find nothing. Hey man, the beers aren't on the house. Hey man, just. (shouting) (groaning) (grunting) (pounding) (snapping) (cracking) (groaning) - Where's Weasel? - I don't who you talking, man. - You're buying from somebody. - Fuck you. Okay man, okay, cool it! (dramatic music) - Freeze! (grunting) So you like to get high, do you? Let's get high. (yelling) - Oh god! (screaming) You crazy motherfucker! Get me down from here! - You ever heard the name Stokes? - I don't know nothing! I just did what they tell me! - And what'd they tell you? - That this black dude was gonna come to me for a fix and that I was supposed to put bet on the guy. - The smack, Weasel, where's it coming from? - Pendleton! Pendleton's sugar mill! Now get me the fuck out of here! - Let's talk about the heroine you're running out of your sugar mills, Pendleton. - What? Who the hell are you? - Brad Spyder. Your worst nightmare. - That badge doesn't mean a damn thing here. - Then this will. - God, you're insane. - Yeah, I know. Someone blew my partner away three nights ago in this hotel room in this sleazy city of yours. - What the hell has that got to do with me? - I think you had him set up. - Drop the gun. - I suggest you do what she says. She's really quite good. - I bet she is. I don't have time for you right now, lady. I'm looking for a cop killer. - The LA cop that was killed downtown. He seems to think we're somehow involved. - Whoever killed Lee Stokes was running a hell of a lot of smack out of your sugar mill and you expect me to believe you don't know anything about it? - Mr. Spyder, my father happens to be president of the Pendleton Group of companies which oversees more than 50 corporations of which sugar is one. If you have any proof to these allegations, we'll be more than happy to look into them. We believe in supporting our law enforcement officers. - You had a son in Nam. - Now that, Mr. Spyder, is my business. - Does the name Jeff Stokes mean anything to you, Mr. Pendleton? - This intrusion is over. Now you just get out! Get out of my house! - Mr. Spyder. I think we should talk. Call me. (downbeat music) - [Brad] Hey, Kanaka. - Hey, Spyder. - I need to ask you a favor. - Sure, you got it. - I need the ballistics report on the Stokes case. - Oh, I can get it for you no problem. It's just I got the graveyard shift tonight. I won't be off til four a.m. - Alright, I'll come by. - Well hey, you're at the Palm View, right? - Yeah. - Well no sweat, I can drop it off on the way home. - Great. Oh, by the way. What do you know about a guy named Roderick Pendleton? - Pendleton? - Yeah. - You mean his money is involved in this? - Could be. - Jesus, man, don't tell the chief. - Why? - Roderick Pendleton is the most prominent citizen this town has got. He supports everything. Especially the police force. Man, he is like a god in these parts. Even if the loss of his son's thrown the guy a little bit out of wack. - What happened to his son? - He was a chopper pilot in Nam. He got shot down. The old man thinks he's still alive somewhere. There's some talk about him putting together a team and go in and pull the guy out. Stuff like that. - Alright, thanks. I'll see you at four. - I'll bring the stuff over. Here's those ballistics reports you wanted. Checked the slugs we found in the room with all the firearms registered on the island. I called central Honolulu, same thing. Those guns had to have been brought in. - Psst, hey mister. Psst. Hey mister. Come here, come here. - Let yourself in. - Listen, there were a couple of guys in your room just a while ago. I thought you ought to know. - Kanaka! (exploding) Emma, get some help! - What the hell happened out there? - Well sir, according to the clerk, there was this big explosion. Then that Spyder guy, he comes running out, hops into the cop car and hauls ass out of there. (dramatic music) (brakes squealing) - I want a roadblock set up out here at coastal road, right now. (metal crashing) (exploding) (car exploding) - Wanna fuck with me, huh? You wanna fuck with me, motherfucker? Come on. Fucking head off, motherfucker. You're a dead man! (mumbling) you fucking head off. - You're the cocksucker that killed Stokes! - (mumbling) let him go! Let him go! Come on, come on! (grunting) (gun firing) (knocking) - My god. - Found the guy that killed Lee. - I feel responsible for this. I wasn't exactly truthful with you. When I ran his name through the computer, I found some classified files. I got into them and I found out that Stokes wasn't a POW. He was a deserter. It seems that the army had more of his kind than they'd like to admit so some got reclassified missing in action. - So Friedkin goes and finds Jeff somewhere up in Asia and brings him back to do a song and dance for your old man. - I also ran Friedkin's file. He was with the CIA but he was fired for running drugs out of Laos and Cambodia. - You knew that all the time. - It would have killed my dad to know that it was nothing more than a cruel scam. Friedkin had promised that Kevin was coming back this week. - Sounds to me that Friedkin's bringing in a shipment. He's not bringing your brother back. (sirens wailing) (chattering) - Load up the gear, get the men ready. We're moving out of here. Come on. (tense music) - Stay where you are, Spyder! Are you alright, Ms. Pendleton? - Look chief, we need to-- - Stay the god damn fuck where you are, you god damn walking disaster! One of my cops is dead and one of my cars' a total wreck. You've been harassing the town's most prominent citizen. You're under arrest! - Chief, my father's been taken for five million dollars. - There's a guy with a god damn army out there and he's flying in a whole load of smack into your precious little town and we need to do something about it now! - Matthews, with me. Davidson, get a back up. In case LA law here is on the level. And you, get in the front seat where I can see you all the time. - [Roderick] What's the matter? - That LA cop is throwing a monkey wrench into things. We're gonna have to move fast if we're gonna bring Kevin back. - Not gonna let that young misguided cop get in my way now. I've waited far too long for this. - Good, we'll need the cash right now. - Of course. - Friedkins' taken over the compound. (guns firing) - What on earth is going on? - Never mind, never mind! (guns firing) (guns firing) - Dad! - It's Karen. - It's all a lie! - She doesn't know what she's saying. The money, Pendleton, the money! For Kevin! - Karen wouldn't lie to me. She never has. - That cop has fucked up her head, man. Can't you see that? We need the cash now before it's too late. - Daddy, please, listen to me! They can't bring Kevin back! They're using you! They don't even care about Kevin! - Get the god damn cash, Pendleton! - You are on the level, aren't you? Kevin is everything to me. Promise me his safe return. You promised me. You said you'd bring my boy home! - [Friedkin] Pick him up! (gun firing) (gasping) (guns firing) - Dad! He took my dad. - I'll be in touch. - You bring the five million dollars, fly it on down to the old refinery tomorrow by 11 o'clock alone or else the old man dies. Do you understand? - There's nothing I hate worse than a crooked cop. (grunting) How far are you willing to take this? - As far as I have to. - What's the deal? - The plane is on the strip now ready for the men and the gear. The girl's on the way with some money. It's gonna be tight but we'll make it. - What about the old man? - I want them to fly out of here but not too far. - Smart. 10 grams of plastic on the base of the trail motor. Look like an accident. - The more confusion we create, the more time we got. - Think the girl will show? - She'll show. - What about the cop? - I hope he shows. (laughing) - Go. - Go to it. Okay, rendezvous at the strip, one minute. Come on, move it! (exploding) (yelling) - Get her back up there. - No, you have the money! Now let us go! - Change of plans! Get up there with him, hurry up! (tires squealing) (sirens wailing) (guns firing) (grenade exploding) (guns firing) (grenade exploding) (guns firing) (groaning) (shouting) (guns firing) (yelling) (groaning) (grunting) - Pendleton! (gun firing) (screaming) (sirens wailing) (shrieking) (groaning) (gun firing) (groaning) (shouting) (yelling) (helicopter exploding) (grunting) (yelling) (upbeat music)
