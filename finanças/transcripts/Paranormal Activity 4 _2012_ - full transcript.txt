Thanks for cock-blocking me. His name's Robbie And he Iives across the street These are good facts. And he comes into my tree house At 10:00 at night So what did she say? His mom is single, and apparently she's really busy and she works a lot, so she's not really home, so l guess he's kind of lonely. At their old house, he used to do the same thing and go play in the neighbor's playhouse. What? ln the middle of the night? Yeah, so he thought it was normal. -l know! -Go over there and... -l know. -Just... That's crazy. Yeah, just, like, beyond the shirt. Okay, no. -Just like a quick boobie. -What? Just quick boobie. Okay, l'm gonna go. This chat's done, and l'm gonna go make a snack downstairs. No, no, no! Take me with you. Take you with me? Yes, take me with you. God, you're so needy! Just be quiet. Everyone's asleep. Why is it so dark? 'Cause everyone is sleeping. So if I was Iike, "Yeah!", am l waking them up? l don't think my mom and dad would want to go together. At least you stay at home. l have to go to Mexico. And that blows. Mexico sounds really fun. lt sucks, 'cause, literally, l have to sleep in my grandpa's bed, like, with my grandpa. And he's, Iike, a massive farter. Ben! Gross. lt's, like, airy. l can feel them brush up against my leg. Are you all right? Look. Something's happening at that kid Robbie's house. Hey, Mom? What's going on? There is something definitely going on over there. What's going on? -l got to go. -Wait! No, no! Look, he's coming! He's coming! Come on! -What? -Come on! Look at him. Oh, my God, l love this kid. The socks with the sandals is my favorite part. Front door open. Hi, Robbie. How you doing? Come on in. Come on in. Wyatt? Want to come say hi to Robbie? Come on.

He straight-up, "Hello." Shook his hand. What happened to Robbie's mom? lt's not good. She's gonna be in the hospital for, like, two or three days. -Really? -Yeah. So he's just gonna stay with us? Yeah. l don't know what else to do. He doesn't have anywhere to go. He doesn't have any relatives? No, he doesn't have anybody. Do you even know his mom, though? Like, it's really nice, but we don't even know them. My pillow. Okay. That's cute. Shipshooba. Cool. -Careful with that! lt's 1 00 years old. -Shipshooba. Freaky. Toothbrush. That's good. You need that. And special fork. You know, we have forks here, Robbie. Careful. ls this 1 00 years old, too? Yeah. That is a very expensive fork, too. What does it do that's so special? lt tells the future. Be in my room. Bye! -How's Robbie doing? -l think he's fine. l mean... -Are they getting along? -He's a little weird. l know. l know, honey. But after what happened last night to his mom... -Good night, sweetheart. -Okay, good night. lf it helps at all, my parents fight constantly. Like aII the time. lt's different. My parents just... They don't fight, they just act like everything's okay. -WeII... -You know? How bad is it? Do you think they're gonna get a divorce? No. l don't know. l think they're gonna try and hold it together for Wyatt. Honestly, they're probably just going through a phase. 'Cause my parents go through phases all the time where they're, like... They'll like each other for three months -and then they'll hate each other. -No, they just... They don't even look at each other. Like, l can't remember the last time they kissed. Back door open. l'm sure it's just a phase. You know what I mean? -l'll be right back. -They're totally gonna get... Wait! Where are you going? AIex? What are you doing? Odd Robbie strikes again! Fuck! Oh, my God! He was just standing down in the kitchen right at the open door, just staring at it. He was just... What a weirdo. lt's, like, midnight. -What is he doing... -Robbie was? ...in my kitchen with the door open? Like... He's such a creepy kid. You know what? Wait. Okay. Before l do this, l just want you to know that this is something that my computer does. So when l show you this, don't, like, freak out or anything. 'Cause l didn't do it on purpose. What do you mean, "Don't freak..." "Alex Chat"? Blow your fucking mind. Ben! You recorded our video chats? Yeah. My computer automatically records all of my webcam. -You can't do that. -What are you talking about? lt's a total invasion of privacy. -l didn't do it, my computer did. -lt's disgusting. And you recorded me sleeping? Again, it was my computer. lt didn't log off. -Oh, my God. What are you... -lt has nothing to do with... You think l just sit here and stare at it? -Yeah. -Trust me, in a minute, you're gonna be thanking me that l recorded this. There! There we go, it's coming. What is he doing? What does it look like he's doing? He's getting into bed with you. Right? Tell me that's not creepy. Are you not freaked out? Yeah, l'm very freaked out. You should be. That kid could have been... -Look at him! Look at him! -He put his hand on me! He's trying to cop a feel! So creepy. You know, l didn't want to tell you this, 'cause l knew it'd freak you out, but something else happened last night. What happened? You fart in your sleep. -l don't fart! Stop! -You totally... -Hey. -Oh, my God. The camera again? l'm a Kardashian. Did you know this? -No, l didn't. -Yes, l am, actually. You look better than a Kardashian. ...six years old. That would freak anybody out, seeing their mom get taken away in an ambulance. Yeah, l know, but l just... l don't know. l think it was really creepy that he came in my bed. Well... Listen, he's gonna be here a few more days. What? Forjust maybe like two or three, but we got to do it. He doesn't have anybody. So... He doesn't have anyone? Would you get off the counter, please? l would listen to her. She's got a knife in her hand. -Yeah, l've got a very large knife. -Well... And she's wielding it. lnappropriately large knife.

Okay, look at that, bud. -lsn't that cool? -What is it? l look like l'm an alien. Kinect projects these tracking dots, basically. This is the coolest thing l've ever seen! That's how they pick up your body movement -and all that kind of stuff. -Right. That's really cool. But you can only see it with the infrared. lt's badass, right? Watch your language! Okay.

See how it's moving? -See? -Yeah. lt looks like he was looking at it, though, 'cause... Yeah, no, l see. Maybe it's, like, broken or something. That is just... That is weird.

Listen to me! l feel like Robbie brought something into the house and it's... lt's messing with me. -Sweetie, l know it was super scary. -l've been hearing noises. l would have freaking lost my mind if l was standing under it. Just a freak accident, and l'm worried about that one, l'm worried about these in here... This stuff started happening ever since Robbie got here. Like, l came home and Wyatt's train turned on by itself. And l heard noises. Honey, would you just put that away for five seconds? This is not really... lt's 2:00 in the morning and there's a bunch of cars at Robbie's house and l'm gonna go check it out. Who are all these people? -Hi. Can l help you? -Sorry. Wrong house! Cool!

Follow me. ls he nice? lf you do what he says. How do you know that that wasn't his mom? -You've never seen her. -Because she's young. My mom said that she's young. -Young as in, she's, like, 30 young? -Young as in, like, not 300 years old. Or like, "l'm an older woman "and l don't want to make my age sound old"?

What? Who? Who does not like me? -You'll find out. -Wyatt, why did you do this to yourself? -You have to take a bath. -What the fuck? What? l can't hear you. What? They're all sleeping. l'm sure. Maybe. Hey, guys. Hey, what are you doing? Wyatt, can l talk to you? Can you pause the game, or... Just let Robbie play. lt's Robbie's turn. Why did you get up last night? Did you have a nightmare? Don't tell her anything. Robbie! He can tell me... l don't like the way that, when your friend's around, you won't talk to me and tell me things. l really don't appreciate it.

What is that? -What is that? -Yes! lt looks like a triangle with a circle in the middle. No shit! -Right there. -That? Looks like scribbles on his back.

"The host will begin to exhibit signs of pre... "Preternatural ability." Robbie's been doing that. Been doing that a lot. "Affirmation. "The host would... "The host would have to prove its preternatural ability to the demon." What was he doing last night? He was probably proving that. "Sacrifice. "The host will be compelled to spill the blood of an inviolate." -Who is? -A being... lt's "a being that has not been profaned and remains pure." So, like a... Like a virgin? Yeah. Yeah, l guess so. You're fucked. You're fucked, too. No, l'm not! Yes, l have. -Like, three times. -Really? Yeah? Three times, four different girls. S'up? l understand you're a little nervous, due to this. We can get it out of the way for you. But... No. -Just run upstairs real quick. -Ben. Stop. Hi. WeIcome back to Cooking with Chef Mary. l'm frequently asked basic questions about the kitchen. After that, cut the beII pepper into long strips. Finally, pile all of the red bell pepper strips together... Mom! -Wyatt? -You're ready to go. Voilá. What, honey? l can't find my tiger! Where'd you put it? Honey, it's under your bed. lt's not there! lt's under your bed. Just look for it. l am! Most commonly, roasted for a variety of dishes. Mom! What? l found it! ...red bell pepper, you can add it at various points in your cooking to give your dish a slightly different fIavor and texture. The cool thing about red bell peppers is that they have more vitamins and nutrients than green bell peppers. What the fuck did l do with the fucking knife? Red bell peppers are not hot and, in fact, they're sweet. So when you're cooking, if you want a sweeter dish, add lots of bell pepper. And if you don't want a sweet dish, then make sure that... ...cut the top and the bottom off. And don't forget... l'm insane. ...and run it verticaI down the sides of the bell pepper. Open the beII pepper up, and use the bIade to cut out the white pith and the seeds. Remember, the sharper the knife, the easier it is... Want some cheese, hon? Want some more cheese? -Wyatt, want some more cheese? -No. Did you hear that? lt's just Robbie. Don't do what right now? Talk about what's happening? Don't start with the noises. Not in front of your brother. All right, you guys. We'll be back in a bit. Okay? -Okay. -You be good. -Bye, Mom. -Bye, hon. Front door open. Wyatt. Yeah? lt's time to go. -Now? -Yeah, now. l thought we were going tonight. They're waiting for us. Come on. Are you kidding me? Those little shits. Front door open. -Hey, watch out! -Fucking Prius! You're gonna get yourself killed! Hello? Wyatt? Hello, is anybody home? Hello? Hello? lt's Alex from across the street. ls anybody home? Guys? Guys, come on, we're not supposed to be in here. What? Wyatt? What? What are... What are you guys doing? We got to go back home right now! l'm supposed to be babysitting. -No! -Yes, yes! -Wyatt! No. -No, Wyatt, stay here! ...doing? Oh, my God. Mom is gonna be so mad. l was supposed to be babysitting. -Hey. Alex, yeah? -Yeah. -l'm Robbie's mom. -l'm so sorry. l didn't know you were home yet. No, no, no, it's fine. lt's fine. We've just been hanging out. Can you thank your mom for me? You guys have been such a big help. Yeah. Yeah, okay. Okay, Wyatt, you're in trouble. -Thank you for hanging out with Robbie. -Wyatt. -Wyatt? -Yeah? Shake. He looks just like his mom. -Shake. -l guess so. -Handshake. -Wyatt, let's go. No, no, no. Let's just... Can we just... You can't just run across the street and not tell me. That's so not cool. What if you got, like, kidnapped or something? We live in a good neighborhood. She didn't even look sick. Well, that's good. She's better. No, like, she didn't look sick at all. Like she hadn't been sick. Don't be ridiculous, Alex. Are you kidding? You saw her get taken away in an ambulance. What? She wasn't sick? She just did it for fun? She did call. She called me and she left a message and... l missed her call and then they just went over there. She called you? But how would Robbie know that? You want some of this? Oh, my God. You have to try this. -Robbie wouldn't know that. -Come here. Here, l need you to taste test. You're happy that Robbie is gone, right? You wanted him gone? He's gone. So there you go. Hon? Come back upstairs, please. l'm sorry, just come back... -This knife... -What are you doing with the knife? This knife just came from nowhere. Honey, just come back upstairs, okay? This knife just ended up here. Did you see that? Doug, please, could you come back upstairs? l'm sorry, okay? Fine, don't come back upstairs! Remember when you went to Robbie's house? Why were you there in the first place? l wanted to meet her. What'd she say to you? lt's so weird. That me and Robbie are friends because we're both adopted. Robbie's adopted, too? How did she know that you're adopted, though? She just knew. What else did she say to you? That my other family needs me back. What? Wyatt, what are you talking about? We're your family. What? l can't hear you. Okay, l will. Very sleepy. Yeah, sure. l don't know. No, it's not. No, it's not! My name's Wyatt! lt's not Hunter! My name's not Hunter! Wyatt? What are you doing? Buddy, what are you doing down here? You have a nightmare? You all right? You awake? What the fuck is Robbie doing? Hey, guys? Wyatt, where'd Robbie go? What were you guys talking about? He said he got me ready. Ready for what? l don't know, but he said it's my time. What do you mean it's... Wyatt? Come on, hon, the tub's ready! Come on, honey. Tub's ready. Come on. You can bring your movie. Just put it over there. You want bubbles? Yeah. All right, Mr. Bubble! Honey, what did l say? You're gonna get your computer wet. Put it back here. Are you good in there? You got everything you need? Got your bubbles? Everything? -Yep. -Okay. l'll be right back. Two minutes... Hello? Mom! Yeah, we talked about it. Yeah. What time are you coming back? Okay. Yeah, no, l got to go. Wyatt's upstairs. Come on, honey, you got to get out. Let's go, sweetheart. Come on, Wyatt. Come on. Wyatt. Wyatt. Wyatt. Come on, you got to get out. You all right? Okay, come on. l'll tell you what, l have never seen our daughter so knocked out. She is out. -Good. -l mean... l gave her one of my sleeping pills. What? -l had to. -What? -She's been up for two days. -Not prescription? Yeah. Holly, what the hell? -She's 1 5 years old, you don't do that. -What... l mean, are you fucking crazy? l take them all the time. What difference does it make? This makes me nuts! You're gonna give her a drug like that and not ask me? Hey, hon? Honey? Hon? lt's 7:30, you got to get up. Come on, honey. Come on, get up. You're gonna be late for school. Are you good? l feel like l got hit by a truck. Why won't it open? "Hunter." Wyatt. Did you draw that? What's a "Hunter"? What does that mean? -What does it mean? -lt's my name. No, it's not. Your name is not Hunter. Well, it used to be. No, it didn't. Yes, it did. Okay. Stupid computer. Mom, l don't want to babysit. Honey, you're overreacting. We're only gonna be gone for a few hours. l don't want to be alone in this house! You bitch! -What'd you say? -What did they... What did your parents say about his original birth parents? They didn't say anything. They just got mad at me for asking. They were like, "How dare you talk about his adoption! "He's part of the family." And l know he's... l'm not saying that. ...freak out and just start screaming and crying. And he wouldn't sleep. He'd just wake up in the middle of the night and start screaming. My dad was the only one that could touch him. That's ridicuIous. He's not like that now, though. That's what l'm saying. Now he's starting to get quiet again. He doesn't talk to me. Okay, weII, Iisten. Even though it's a cIosed case, or whatever, l can totally figure it out. Everything's on the lnternet... Are you sure you can't come over tonight? We really got to watch the footage. I know, I can't. What? l'm sorry. l'm sorry. I can come over tomorrow, though, and l'll figure it all out. Get a soIution to the probIem. That'll be perfect. lt ranks as weird, he says his name is something that it's not. You know? Yeah, l know. -Did you hear that? -What's up? The garage just opened. Are your parents home? l don't know. They shouldn't be. Garage door open. Can you see it? Yeah, no, it Iooks Iike it's, Iike, stuck. Yeah... l hate this fucking house. Okay, so l'll talk to you later? -All right, l'll talk to you tomorrow. -Okay, T-T-Y-L. Garage door open. Help me! Let me out, please! Help! Please open! Hunter? lt's your Aunt Katie. Open the door, Hunter. Come on. Open the door. You're almost ready, Hunter. Hunter, open the door. Please! Help! lt's okay. l'll be here until you're ready. Can't breathe... l almost died! l...

Can l take you out to dinner? Why? l don't know. So we can talk, just the two of us, you know? About what's been going on. Dad, you don't even listen to me. There's no point in talking. Well, l'm ready to listen to you. So if you want to... l'm going. Hello? How's the dinner going? ls she all right? Okay. We can talk about it later. What time are you coming back? Yeah. Okay. Well... Yeah. Okay. Listen... Well, if you want to call... Oh, my God. Front door open.
