BASED ON TRUE EVENTS DRESSING ROOM Welcome! Ro, Ro! Ro, Ro! Rodrigo! EL POTRO THE BEST OF LOVE Hail Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death. Amen. Hail Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Yes, I understand. But I just got back, I've been there all week. Just a sec... Rodrigo!

Go to sleep! -Can I go with you? -I told you we're not going to discuss that until you finish your studies, ok? I want to sing. -What will you do for a living? -Music, like you. That's still a ways off, Rodrigo. Go to sleep, will you!? You have to give it your all. Whether it's a thousand people or one. You have to give it your best. Who knows? Maybe there's someone in the crowd that wants to hire you.

Buenos Aires is rough. Bad environments. -Let him finish school and then we'll see. -School? He's not going to school, he got expelled. What do you mean he got expelled? You never told me. I can never tell you, you’re never here. Please. Ok, I'm going to go... to the school, to talk with the principal... I've do that, they don't want him. He cuts classes, sneaks out, plays music with his friends. You want to help him? Take him to Buenos Aires. Because Rodrigo only wants to sing. He goes against my wishes, against the order of things. What should I do? I'll do it. He doesn't have material. He needs to have a good repertoire, he has to record a song. You can't just go to Buenos Aires. Stop, stop. -Put in an A. Yes. -A minor? And please play on tempo. Go fuck yourself. -Let's go. -One, two, three, four. ♪Sitting down♪ ♪Smoking and thinking in a bar♪ ♪Writing♪ ♪Looking at your photos and missing♪ ♪Your body ♪ ♪Your room, your things Your cards that are no longer mine♪ ♪I feel cold♪ ♪I don't want to♪ Air out the room a little bit, boys. -Hey dad, when did you get back? -Just now. -How long are you staying? -Two days.

I'm staying here. I'm here, it's okay. Hello. -Did I wake you up? -Yeah. I called you many times. Where were you? Working, a lot. How are you? And the boy? He's better now. Had a fever. A fever? Did you see a doctor? Yes, yes. He had a virus, he's ok now. Put him on the phone. I'll put him on. Rami, come here. It's Dad. Hi, son. It's dad talking. How are you? I sent you some toys, I’ll send more. I miss you. I love you, my king. Sweetie. Give it to me. When are you coming back? Or should we go there? I have a lot of work, they take me from one place to the next. Relax, I'll come back in a few days. But we hadn't agreed on this, I don't want to stay here. Relax. Is anything wrong? We miss you.

We didn't see each other much. But he always came back. We always had everything we needed. No. But I don't want that. I want us to be together. But he was like that when you met him. Pull on the net, it's loose. You'll have time to be together. He's becoming bigger. What he has he owes to his crowd. He's an artist. Hey. What is it? Roundabout. Roundabout. The cops. Where? -Where? -What're you saying? Don't give him anymore to smoke. What's wrong? Hey, hey, hey!
