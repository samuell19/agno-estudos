Since it was once China's colony. Chinese characters as a colony of China... Historical documents prove this. North and South join hands for counter measures against (Japan's) distortion of history North Korea Accelerates Nuclear Development... Bush Refers to North Korea as an 'Axis of Evil' Humanitarian Aid to North Korea continue... Six-party Talks takes a Dramatic Turn... Roads Between North and South Korea Open... Two Koreas Agree to Hold Sports and Cultural Festivals... North and South Exchange Manpower... North and South Plan United Team for Olympics... Separated Families to Travel Freely... Kyungui Railroad Fully Open for Operation... List of Donors of Kyungui Railroad Sleepers... Hello? Alright. The absence of foreign delegations should not interfere with the opening ceremony of the Korean railroad. You're right. Let's start the ceremony. Mr. President! The Foreign Minister of Japan forbids the opening of the Kyungui Railway. What? How can Japan forbid the opening? Japan argues that they possess all the rights to the Kyungui Railway. HANBANDO Precisely! We, Japan, will not allow the opening of the Kyungui Railway. A political document from 1907 proves that all rights of operations of the Kyungui Railway should be permanently handed over to Japan. Japan, still holds all the rights related to the Kyungui Railway. Therefore, we have every justification to forbid the opening of the Kyungui Railway. Are you pressing us to implement a treaty signed under coercion a hundred years ago? Mr. President, it is a treaty that both governments officially signed a century ago, and it is of importance to claim succession. What if we can't accept it? What if we cannot accept your presumptuous demands? Korea and Japan are adjacent countries, not only geographically, but also trading partners politically, culturally and economically. In addition... Many of your multinational companies have licensed important technologies from us. Many Japanese companies and investors are very fond of your country. However, they can't be more fond of your country than their own government. Are you trying to threaten us with your economic power? Oh, certainly not. If your country doesn't implement the treaty, then we simply won't Keep our promise. What promise? Next month, the Japanese government promised to lend 157 billion dollars to your country. The loan will not be transferred until the terms in the treaty signed a century ago are met. The United States government announced that the two Koreas should not have carried out the railroad project without carefully reviewing the ownership of the Kyungui Railway. They're blatantly supporting the Japanese and condemning us. The international community has expressed their negative attitude towards the rapidly improving relationship between the two Koreas. Russia's standpoint can't be much different from those of the U.S. and China. Why don't Russia and China consider the benefits that the Kyungui Railway will bring to their economy? Because this is not simply an economic issue. As you know, China has never been on good terms with Japan. Exactly. Without the consent of the U.S., Japan could have never threatened us and China and Russia are indirectly expressing their reluctance to go against Japan and the U.S. Just because the U.S. agreed, are we doomed to acknowledge that 100-year-old document? We all know the consequences if Japan refuses to loan us the 157 billion dollars. Also, the core technologies and investment capital will be appropriated. Our own major businesses will be outraged and possibly jeopardized! So just because of that... I'm just saying, at the very least, we should avoid the worst. What is today's date? November 17th, Mr. President. I shall evaluate Japan's argument with regards to the authenticity of the document. For that purpose, I shall organize the Presidential Truth Commission. Mr. President! Accepting Japan's request and then gradually expressing our needs shall be the integral solution for us. It will not be the integral solution, but a cowardly compromise if we disguise the truth. Gentlemen, about a century ago to the day, November 17th, Japan illegally violated our sovereignty. We shall not let history repeat itself again. The Prime Minister shall assemble the Presidential Truth Commission. Yes, sir. Yesterday was November 17th Does anyone know what day that is? Wow sir, you're such a romantic. What day was it? It's Diary Day! When couples exchange their love diaries. That's January 14th. Was it double 11 day then? That's November 11th! Well then, does anyone know what the "fox hunt" is? Here, the fox refers to our last Empress. The Japanese officials and military deliberately killed our Empress. Even more unbearable... Oh! I know that! I watched the music video of the last empress. It was so sad. I remember too! The actress who played it was so good! She was like, "I am the mother of the Korean Empire." Do you remember the actor who played the assassin? Oh my god! The actor who played the role of the body guard was so hot! I know!! I even saw the musical! Are you done chatting? Then shut up and go home! If your kids ask you who the last Empress is, tell them to watch more movies. And tell them that the Treaty of Eulsa is just a new medicine for stomach aches. Listen here! What kind of attitude is that? My attitude? What kind of attitude is it to know all the silly days for couples and not know the day when the Empress was assassinated by the Japanese? Leave now!! Get out of here! Are you out of your mind? Who the hell recruited someone crazy like him? What Kind of nutty professor is he? Well, I heard he was fired. We don't need any more of your crazy lectures. Hey! Sang-hyun! Long time no see, Min-jae. Gosh, it's been ages! You haven't changed. I heard you're working for the National Intelligence Service. You must have changed. You think so? It would be nice for you to change a little bit. You must be very busy. So, what are you doing here? Eradicating groundless rumors that aggravates our relationship to Japan is what I do. I understand your inability to distinguish fantasy from reality, because you've been talking nonsense for 20 years. But next time, before you go around spreading this kind of garbage, think twice. Because it could be your life at stake. You think... I spread rumors? Garbage? I'm just warning you not to cause trouble at a time like this. Listen up! LEE Sang-hyun! We studied the history of the Korean Empire together! 100 years ago, Japan played the bad guy. However today, Japan is a crucial economic partner we cannot afford to lose! Don't forget that! Cheers to those who sacrificed their lives for the Empress! More cheers to LEE Kyung-jik who was mutilated for protecting the empress! January 1895, Japan tried to take over our electricity plants. Then, they killed our Empress. Our majesty fled to the Russian Embassy. All the foreign powers wanted a piece of Korea. You forgot something! What? You forgot to bitch about the assholes who betrayed our country. Oh, you mean, the five officials who pawned our sovereignty? Yeah, those assholes. One betrays the country and another kills the Empress. Ha. You do it! I suck at memorizing. I don't want to think about the bad guys today. I'm in the mood for a shot too. Hey, cheers! Why? Is there anything wrong? You seriously don't know what's wrong? The whole country's talking about canceling the opening of the Kyungui line. Man, you should stop talking about the past and know what's going on right now. - Yesterday, - There it goes again! It was proven that Japan interfered... with the opening of the Kyungui line. The world media, including CNN, has reported the news.. Yesterday afternoon, there was an official statement from the Blue House spokesperson that the delay was caused by safety issues of the railroad. However, yesterday... Don't cause trouble during a time like this. It was rather because of the absence of delegations from more than 40 countries. Japan is a crucial economic partner we cannot lose! There is even verbal evidence of the Prime Minister talking with Japan. Today is a very important day. Of course. I hear that the North Korean Orchestra is very talented. Oh, how wonderful. Yes. Nice to meet you. The Japanese are lying! They are lying! I can prove that the Japanese are lying! If we find the authentic national seal we can prove their fraudulence! The national seal on that document is a fake! The Japanese have written that document themselves, and we can prove their lies Let go! If we find the true national seal! Trust me! The state seal is fake! - We should find the real one! - Just ignore him. We should find it! CHOI Min-jae. Has a PhD in Korean History from Seoul National University. Previously worked as a professor for 5 years. Contract was not renewed because he only taught history of the Korean Empire and only requested papers which criticized the officials who betrayed the country. And after that? It seems as though he has been publishing his own research about the invalidity of the Treaty of Japanese Annexation. However, academics have rejected his research and he doesn't seem to have any supporters. Hm.. interesting fellow. What's more, he got divorced last year and worked at five different institutions, but he got fired within two weeks from each job. Anything to add, Prof. CHOI? I don't think so. I just realized today that I moved around to five different institutions. Can you explain what exactly the Japanese are lying about? The document of the Treaty of Japanese Annexation which includes the clause about the right of construction of the Kyungui Railway is inauthentic. Do you mean the document is forged? No. The document itself is probably authentic. But, it was the Japanese who illegally confiscated the seal to obtain sovereignty from the Emperor. Can you prove that? Certainly. All diplomatic documents after the assassination are sealed with an inauthentic national seal. So, who made the inauthentic one? Our own Emperor did. Surprisingly, our Emperor was wise enough to create an inauthentic seal for the Japanese. We shall kill the Empress tonight! Never let her crawl out of the palace! Your Highness. A menacing gang has breached the palace and Your Highness must seek a safer shelter. I would need to visit the Emperor. Your Highness. Please we must evacuate and get you to safety. Where can I go?! Are you not aware that there isn't a single place where I can hide? But, Your Highness... I shall not deny my fate nor die in anonymity. Prepare my visit to the Emperor. We need to get rid of her within the palace. Yes, sir. History will record that she was Killed by the Korean military. What impudence brings your swords to the Emperor? We are here to protect you, Your Highness. You think I'm unaware of your intentions, you rascals? Your safety shall be guaranteed. You! Get her! Where is the Empress? Where is the bitch hiding? Ah! Playing hide and seek? Who should I be hiding from in my own palace, in my country? Stop! Your Highness! Forgive me for my early leave of my duty to assist the throne of which Your Highness was divinely assigned. However, Your Highness! Protecting the imperial lineage cannot be the only duty of the Emperor. The more important duty must be to foresee who shall be living in this land after centuries. And remembering that the fate of the land shall not forever be in the hands of the scoundrels who have plundered our land. As an irresponsible mother of the country, I shall leave my duty behind. Hoping... that my blood will be remembered. Your Highness!! And that my death will not be fruitless... Your...Your... Highness... I should have gotten rid of her earlier! What should I do with the corpse? Burn it and don't leave a single trace! Hong-sun. Yes, Your Majesty. The reason why I renewed the official name and the national seal is to demonstrate our legitimate independence from China and Japan. I shall let the national seal be used exclusively for Korea's own volition. Inscrutable are the King's favors. Yet, I have reached a situation where I can protect neither my country nor even myself. Your Highness. I'm worried not of dying, but of how my young Crown Prince shall endure the threats of our own betrayers, and the Japanese. I am not certain of what purpose this seal shall be used for... Thus, I shall seal the document. Your Majesty, how will you endure the treachery of the Japanese? There will be a time when their treachery shall be revealed to the world. This is a picture of the design of the authentic seal. The authentic seal has been preserved secretly by his closest subordinate. And these are the designs of the inauthentic seals that were used after his death. The inauthentic seals were mostly on the documents that handed over our rights and assets. There is a subtle difference between the two. Obviously, the difference isn't obvious but very subtle so that it is only perceptible upon close examination. Have a close look at the bottom left quadrant. The authentic seals are accurate and lucid. While the inauthentic ones are consistently worn out, and unclear at the edges. This proves that the two seals were carved differently. The edges can abrade easily with time, and the seals were on traditional papers which could have absorbed the ink more or less... Prof. CHOI Min-jae I'm afraid that sort of difference could be of importance in the academy, but not in politics. For example, a fly with mutated legs can be a great discovery for biologists but for everyone else, it is still justa fly. I agree. And the Emperor must have had the exact same dilemma. Only a difference as subtle as of a leg of a fly could trick the Japanese. But if too subtle, his own descendants may treat it as nothing more than just that. So, he did just one more thing. If you analyze every single symmetry, density, pressure, and engraving of the seal, there is just one more quadrant with a difference It is the upper right quadrant. The quadrants of the authentic seals are exactly symmetrical: 50:50. All the other authentic documents are exactly symmetrical as well. However, all later diplomatic documents show a discrepancy, an asymmetry of 48:52. This discrepancy cannot be caused by neither time nor any kind of external influence, and is perfectly intended to be asymmetrical. Without doubt, the document Japan has presented must be asymmetrical as well. If we find the authentic seal... It will rewrite the modern history of Korea and Japan. Well... this is on the premise that the authentic seal will be discovered. The authentic seal exists. And I think I know where it is. With all that assurance and possibility, what were you doing until now? As a lousy historian expelled from the academy, I didn't have enough power to do that. What does that mean? It is buried at a place where you cannot excavate without a special permission from the President. Bye baby! Asshole. You want some coffee? Who is it? Just a young history student who wants to learn from an imperial descendant. So may I come in? Wait! Learning requires a lot of patience. Come back tomorrow morning. Who the hell? Sh! Be quiet! It's a bit of an urgent matter... The Empire has fallen since a century and few decades... One more night's discussion won't a make a difference. Who the hell is it? I'll see you tomorrow. You sure you don't want to see me? As an imperial descendant, I don't retract my words. I came here for an opportunity to make use of that treasure of yours. Well, if you insist... Good evening. What are you doing?! As a royal descendent, I may sacrifice my personal feelings for a noble cause. What the fuck? Good night, darling. Wow! Living in imperial style? My ass! Damn, I spent three and a half months getting that girl. Why, of all of the days! Is she a widow? So, what how? I better see that book again. Which one? The diary of Sir KIM Hong-sun. Oh, I was about to tell you that I got rid of that already. A few days ago, I sold it to a rich dude who collects antique documents. So, you sold it to him? I told you that we should have found gold with that book! Yeah right, I know you didn't! I warned you. If there were hints of places with staggering relics in that diary, they're not just worth a million dollars! Did you really sell it? 1 did! I don't believe you. With your academics and my mining... um... skills, we could have found several lumps of gold by now. You didn't really sell it, did you? I said for the hundredth time! You're the descendant of the closest subordinate of the Emperor. You can't do that. Why can't I? You're the one who told me it's worth at least a hundred grand. You're crazy if you don't sell that! Imperial descendants don't exchange treasures for money! Are you going to deny your imperial lineage?! Being an imperial descendant doesn't pay for my living. Either you find me the seal, or find me a good buyer to sell the thing. Don't you think I've waited long enough? Well, if you can't do anything about it, I'm going to sell it or you'll see it on TV tonight. Yes, sir! Did you find the place? What are all these? One of the 78 ways of concealing the imperial treasures. Mix the real thing with the imitations to hide it from the thieves! Let's see... You must take good care of it. Of course... The Emperor's last wishes must be upheld. Must have truckloads of gold in it. Your great grandfather would be very happy. Have you ever seen a real lump of gold? Sir KIM! Sir CHOl! Sir KIM! Sir CHOl! Sir KIM! The President. Let's start without an introduction. Time is of essence at times like this, so we shall omit introductions. In front of you, there is research data in the form of copies of computer files. If you need the original, I shall provide it for you within 24 hours. Other materials may also be requested and they will be provided to you shortly. All research findings shall be combined by Dr. LEE Sang-hyun, the Chairman of the Committee, who shall report to the President. I'm LEE Sang-hyun, Secretary of National Intelligence Service. He was appointed by the Prime Minister for his PhD in History, and he is in charge of highly confidential information about Japan. I never knew there were history PhDs in the National Intelligence Service. The purpose of the Presidential Truth Commission is to examine the authenticity of the document that Japan has presented... The purpose is to prove that the document is fake. In order to do that, all of you shall concentrate in finding the authentic state seal. But Mr. President, are you aware that the authentic national seal has disappeared? Oh, yes of course. But... Finding it is our only solution. Am I correct? Yes, sir. As a historian, as a Korean citizen, use whatever sense of duty you've got to find the authentic national seal, the symbol of Korean sovereignty. I shall show the world what Japan has done to our country. I am willing to sacrifice my life for this. It is your responsibility to give me the ammunition to fight with. Thank you very much. This place is where my great grandfather's mother used to live. Well, it's a traditional village now with five national treasures, where you're not allowed to excavate anything. So, what brings us here? You'll see. What's wrong with you? Why are you spending money excavating? You won't find anyone better at this in the entire country than me. All I need is just a shovel. Don't need to show the whole world that we're digging gold! There ain't no gold here anyway. What? No gold? We're not here to dig gold. Then what? The National Seal. Hey Sir. KIM! C'mon, Sir. KIM! Leave me alone! Only "Sir" when you need me, huh? Frankly, I don't care about my imperial lineage! All I care about is gold! You know how long I've spent trying to find gold. What do you want to do with the state seal? That's not going to make you any money. So, you're not interested? Not interested. Up to you then. I memorized the contents and I already took a picture of the diary. So, I don't think we need you that much here. Well, take care. I was just sorry to leave an imperial descendant at a motel. See you around. What are you doing there? Just watching. Don't just watch! Start working! Hey! You! Where do you think you're going? The crane might damage the gold! Who the hell is that dude? I don't Know. Maybe, some Kind of circus master? Maybe he thought it was a circus because of the tent. Hey, hey, hey. Don't you realize that every single piece of the tiles are national treasures? Hey you! Don't set the post down in the middle but on the edges, and tie them with a rope. I'm sick and tired of those assholes who brag about everything. I wonder why they always have the loudest voices. Sh! He might hear you! There's no use digging here because I think they're underneath the buildings. Well, I'm positive that it is buried here, so we should dig up the entire place to find it! The entire place?! This is Lee Sang-Hyun speaking. Wow! What an amazing dinner! You know that we're both busy Let's just get on with it. Well, we're both working on the same project. Ooh! This is the finest taste of Korean cuisine! He's just a colleague of mine. I guess a man with a criminal record for grave robbery must be quite useful Oh well, I think there's a misunderstanding. But, all I wanted was to protect the royal assets... Do you think you can find the seal from the subordinate's mother's house? Well, do you think a bunch of famous professors can find the seal then? No. All we getis a truckload of evidence that there is no authentic seal. Then, I'm glad that we're working towards different goals, because I didn't want to work with an asshole like you. Good luck then. Hope you can prove that there is no seal. There is no national seal. A genius from the university turns into a fool within 10 years. Again, there is no seal and even if there is, there shouldn't be one. Why? If you wish, I can guarantee you a job at a school of your choice. Or, if you wish to go Canada to your family we can provide you the means... I must find the national seal to prove it to you rascals who betrayed our country and our people to fill up your bellies! I'll find it no matter what. Why? What for? Don't you know? For pride? For the pride of Koreans? Is there anything wrong with that? Of course there is. If you exchange pride for material stuff... you would lose everything, you mean? Are you afraid of Japan? I'm afraid of anything that threatens our economy. And I'm right. We must be afraid of them. Well, I'm different. If 1 had the energy to runaway from something, I would use it to fight it. We shouldn't see each other until I find the seal. I didn't finish dinner... yet... Pride! Hubris! They're all nothing! If politicians don't realize that all they get from defending the pride of the country is simply a tedious repetition of threats from the powerful countries, you and the President and, thanks to you, the people shall all pay a miserable price. Only villains pay a miserable price in history That's how the story goes. Sir CHOl! Sir CHOl! What? Most people at my age should be the head of a construction site, but all I do here is labor! I'm so unlucky. I thought it would be some national project, and all I do is digging! Digging for nothing! Let's work harder, guys! Even if we don't know what it's for, it is all for our country so work hard as citizens of your country. My country? My ass! What does a national seal have to do with our patriotism? A national seal? What is a national seal? You dumb ass, it's the seal used by the emperors. Do you know what it looks like? We should at least know what it looks like. Should be in a fancy box 'cause it's the Emperor's. Hey KIM, am I wrong? Sir CHOl! But, why do they call it a national seal, not a jade seal? A jade seal? What is that? Is that also a...um... seal? Man, you're so ignorant! I knew you looked quite dumb, but never knew you were this retarded. You retarded dumb ass! Hey, what did you call me? A retarded dumb ass?! You...you... should apologize!! Just joking, you dumb ass! As a royal descendant, it should be my responsibility to enlighten the illiterate. So, I shall explain about the national seal that we're looking for. But, hey... um... l heard your... grandfather was a eunuch? How can you be his descendant? There's always a way... In order to maintain the lineage eunuchs customarily adopt sons. So, if the adopted son is castrated and you adopt another son and castrate him too, then you can't be related in blood to the eunuch called KIM Hong-shin or Hong-sun or... So you aren't really related to him but, why do you speak like that? Like a real member of the royal family? Ah... what ignorance! Hey, hey, guys! Does anyone here know about the national seal? No one, right? Just teach us about it, teacher. Well, if you insist... Well, the national seal is the seal used in the government. Just the way we use our very own legal seals. There were eight different seals and they were all national seals. Some people call it the jade seal, because it was made out of jade. However, at the start of the Korean Empire, national seals were made out of gold. So, educated people would say "national seal," instead of "jade seal." So you mean all eight are buried here? No. Out of the eight, the seal used for diplomacy, which is the most important one at this time, is buried here. Then, why would something important like that be buried at a place like this? Did you ever steal it and bury it here? Hey, hey, hey! Let's work now, if you're done eating. Min-jae! Where were you all this time? The Presidential Truth Commission has reviewed six possible whereabouts of the missing seal. Remaining within our borders. Extrusion to Japan. Extrusion to the U.S. or North Korea. Theft. Damage. Above all, these are only possibilities on the premise that the national seal actually exists. A few historians allege that the Emperor handed over the inauthentic seal to the Crown Prince, but again, it is merely an allegation. In other words, the inauthentic seal could merely be a figment of one's imagination. If I remember correctly, I thought you agreed to my idea that if we find the missing seal, everything would be settled. Well, yes. What I meant was that if we find the seal and prove that the document is authentic, we could only acknowledge Japan's demands. There is also a record that after liberation, Gen. McArthur confiscated it from the Japanese... But after the Korean War, no one knows what happened to it? Yes, that's right. It was most likely destroyed during the war. So the destroyed seal is the one and only national seal? Yes, sir. The inauthentic seal never existed in the first place and it is purported that the seal for diplomacy has been destroyed. If it hasn't been destroyed, can you find it in three weeks? We concluded that it is impossible to find it in three weeks. I believe it is your duty to turn the impossible into possible. It is not your responsibility to conclude how we shall confront the Japanese. Instead, if it is damaged, it is your responsibility to find when, where, and how it was damaged. Rain in early winter? What a day! Shouldn't we be paid extra for rainy days? I agree. I guess you're not as dumb as I thought you were! Don't underestimate me! And who are those men in black? Hmm... the one in front looks quite familiar... Yeah, same here... Shit! It's the p... p... p... p...p... what? P... President! Sir CHOIL... Sir CHOl! Are you still confident? Yes, sir. Can you find it in two weeks? Sir, if the Emperor felt the same way you feel right now, it should definitely be buried here. That's what I told the Secretary-General. Although I made up my mind in two days, you spent 20 years over this. It's taking 20 years of my persistence to reveal the truth to the world. Remember that the history of the Korean Peninsula for the past 100 years is in your hands. I'm actually quite ashamed of myself as the President that I can only give two weeks to a man who has fought for 20 years. Mr. President! It's a call from the Minister of Defense. Yes? Approach within 1 km from the military demarcation line. There is no movement of the Korean Navy within 10 km. They should be here soon. What about the Air Force? Two reconnaissance planes are in flight... heading 245...263. Request for ljisuham fighter flight formation. I think they're approaching, check the enemy's expected direction! The Maritime Self-Defense Forces are moving towards the East Sea. How are we planning to respond? To provide for contingencies, the combat air forces are preparing for assault. And the Navy has mobilized all their fleets in open waters. Although they are moving aggressively, they haven't yet trespassed our borders. So if we move first, we may be blamed. So we haven't yet analyzed Japan's intentions... Aren't their intentions obvious? They're trying to pressure us with their military power. For the time being, I believe we should accept their demands... Did you say the Foreign Minister of Japan? Yes, sir. The reason why we, Japan, have placed our Navy near the border is for the protection of our eternal ally. Protection from what? From North Korea and China of course... There were many times when N. Korea and China changed their minds at the last minute, which resulted in a lot of trouble. Last minute before what? The process of correcting the justified ownership of the Kyungui Railway. Your Highness, exiled Korean politicians are compromising your safety. Japan can only protect Your Highness from them. So... your intentions are to re-vote on the rejected bill from a decade ago? The right of construction of the Kyungui Railway was promised by your predecessors. As a result, Your Highness must fulfill the promises. Your Highness! We shouldn't worry about Russia. Two hours from now, the Japanese fleets shall arrive in Incheon. They would not dare to threaten Your Highness, when we are protecting you. So, Korea and I should succumb to your ruthless demands and you shall prevent intervention by North Korea and China through your military force... Am I correct? Mr. President! If you think these are ruthless demands, you are denying the history of the Korean Empire. If that document is fake... Sir! Is Japan ready to pay for the consequences of authenticity? Are you about to show to the world how a president of a country can be swayed by a silly academic? How dare you mobilize an army to your neighbor's front door even though it hasn't been properly established after you instigated World War Il Mr. President, please! He is the Foreign Minister of Japan. Please, control yourself... Is it your style of diplomacy to sneak in and to threaten the President? Now, answer me. Mr. Gurozawa. You could not have come here on your own. So is Japan ready to pay for the consequences when the truth is revealed? Why should we pay the consequences, if it is really the two Koreas who are desperate for the 157 billion dollars? Japan will not be able to co-exist with the other nations if it keeps believing that history will repeat itself. We'll see about that. Sir, the national seal has been discovered! It was reported by Prof. CHOI's team that they excavated it just a while ago. As of now, it seems inevitable to verify the authenticity of the document. Mr. Gurozawa, once we verify it, we shall inform you of the results. I shall use the National Intelligence Service to securely transport the seal. Certainly, Prime Minister Yes, sir. It's fortunate that we found the seal. Right, Prime Minister? Of course. Mr. President! He must be a genius! All the effort we put into this was not fruitless after all! Remember! I told you there was something about that area over there. That's what I said! That area could be the only place! Shut up, you fool! You never said that! Hey, don't you underestimate me! Well, you deserve it... Who... the hell? Who are those men in black over there? Well, the man in front doesn't seem familiar. Well, you see... as the manager of the excavation, I shall remark this is a historical moment, unveiling the hidden history of the Korean Empire... Should you entrust it to us or take it personally? Would you entrust it to a guy like you? Follow me then! Hey, I can't entrust it to you! You can't just donate it without a penny! That's not fair! We all worked hard together for it! - I agree! - What a thief! That ass! Wait here! Can't do that! That yellow dot should be... the homing device attached to the box of the national seal. A homing device? It could be the key to the political future of Far East Asia. We should protect it well. Don't move! The yellow dot went off track. The yellow dot went off track. I report, the yellow dot went off track. I repeat, the yellow dot went off track. The yellow dot suddenly went off track and is moving at full speed. Answer me, SP101! What is your position, SP1027? Report your position, SP102! Alright. Don't lose track of them. I think a special metal was used to block the homing device's electric waves. It must be perfectly plotted. I order the Emergency Mobilization Order No. 3 as a Presidential decree. Defense Headquarters must besiege the Japanese Embassy and inspect all cars entering the Embassy. Yes, sir. Inspection without cause could lead to a serious diplomatic censure. The only countries who are aware of the discovery of the national seal are Korea and Japan. We couldn't have stolen it ourselves, so who else could it be except for the Japanese? I think they are determined to move forward. They must be all out of their minds. Get out! The homing device has been eliminated. You son of a bitch, LEE Sang-hyun! I mean... What are you going to do with it? Hey, LEE Sang-hyun... LEE Sang-hyun! It's just a seal... It's only a stamp from a country that was destroyed a century ago... Why on earth did you spend 20 years of your life on this crap? Don't you realize what the appearance of the national seal means to our politics? And that it is certainly not time for playing hide and seek with these antiques! No!! Leave me alone! Hey, you son of a bitch! You! You studied all that crap in school for this? You just betrayed the spirit of our country! You asshole! All national seals should be made in an alloy of five different metals, but you could probably make it with mostly tin 'cause you only had a week or two to fake it! So, how, what are your intentions? That...that is fake?! What do you wish to achieve through faking the national seal that is detrimental to our politics?! You know you don't spend 20 years on any old antique. Then what? It is the key to unlocking the truth! What truth? Who do you think created this crisis? A country cannot be at stake with just that piece of paper from Japan. You know very well that in history the internal enemy is the real enemy. Internal enemy? The national seal will be discovered... There's no point looking for... I know where it is!! Now, we will find the real national seal! Just tell me, if you are willing to fight against the real enemy for the truth. Check the radar! Prepare missile launch! Cannons ready. Ready for naval bombardment. Ready for torpedo launch. U.S. Forces Line 5 cannot be operated. What? Mr. President. I think the crisis will be aggravated. Atten---tion! Are they ready for war? Who is our Navy Commander-in-Chief? Admiral LEE Dong-jae. It's a call from the President. Yes, sir. Commander-in-chief speaking. It's been a long time, Admiral LEE. Yes, sir. It seems like we're in a predicament. Their Maritime Self-Defense Forces are directly positioned against our fleets. What does that actually mean? It means they are ready for war. If there is one, what is the possibility of... defending ourselves? Our naval military strength is only about 30% of that of the Japanese Maritime forces. Objectively, we cannot win the war. However, if war is inevitable, we can defend ourselves. I've always learned that war is about neither the strength nor the number. I shall defend my country. I am authorizing you with the right to attack. From now on, the sea of Korea is in your hands and our Navy. No one shall enter our sea without our permission. Thank you, Mr. President! All fleets must be mobilized! All fleets ready for action! Gunwales head to the stem! Gunwales head to the stem! One Japanese destroyer. Direction 350, Distance 5200, It is breaking away from battle array. Another destroyer. Heading 348. Distance 5.6 miles. It is changing directions to its original position. Proclaim anti-air weapons free in all fleets and prepare for attack. Japan is responding against a state of national emergency. What does it mean? Their Maritime Self-Defense forces have started their offensive radars. There are rumors that there will be a war. There is no country that does nothing when its embassy is seized. We must withdraw our troops from the embassy and apologize immediately. Only Japan can protect us, Your Highness. Offending Japan will lead to political suicide. He's right, Your Majesty. In order to oust the barbarians, we should borrow the military strength of Japan. Please be understanding, Your Highness. If Japan not only repulses our enemies but also protects our land, who shall this land belong to and who is the sovereign? And those who speak highly of Japan, which country and who are you loyal to? Please don't repeat the mistakes our Emperor has made, Mr. President. The fate of our people depends on this case. We should not be hostile to them. I believe a nation is not a company, Prime Minister. As the leader of our people, I intend to defend the pride of our people. Our people will pay the consequences for the President's personal decision. We should hear from our people. Their position can't be much different from ours. We have a long way to go for a national vote. The meeting is adjourned. Would he have felt the same way? He must have felt worse... Mr. President. Could you get me a glass of cold water? You!! You!! Mr. President! Will he be okay? Yes, hopefully... When will he regain consciousness? Is it impossible? It's hard to say since it happened because of fatigue and stress. We only have a week until the joint ceremony with Japan. What is the possibility of his regaining consciousness? It could be impossible... The Prime Minister. I shall do my very best for the President's recovery. As the Chief of Medical Affairs has mentioned, The President will not be able to execute his duties nor be able to appoint an acting president. Therefore, I, the Prime Minister, shall take over his duties, as written in our constitution. We should quickly discuss the essential matters. Minister of Defense? Yes, sir. Have you withdrawn our troops from the Japanese Embassy? Yes, sir. Good job. Director? Suspend all orders from the President and withdraw all dispatched staff. Should I also suspend the search for the national seal? After careful review, we have concluded that we don't have an option other than to accept their demands. Shouldn't we find the national seal before we conclude anything? Have you actually found the seal yet? What do you mean, sir? Was the discovered seal real then? Of course, sir. Then, it means that you have failed to transport an object of national importance and identify its whereabouts for more than 40 hours. From now on, the Director of National Intelligence Service will need my final approval before any decision is made. Director! You should be aware of the consequences of leaving this room without permission during a national emergency meeting. Yes, indeed, as much as I am aware of your intentions. Good then. A week from now in the joint ceremony with Japan, we will sign an agreement that we will turn over all rights of the Kyungui Railway. In addition, I will launch an organization that reviews all contracts signed with Japan during the Korean Empire. Are your intentions to ... Serve the Japanese a huge banquet? All I'm saying is that we should always prepare for emergencies. I agree. We should always prepare... Prepare for what?! Are you going to acknowledge other illegal contracts as well? We will temporarily suspend all plans for unification until we're no longer in a state of emergency. You wish to run counter to the one wish of the people and beg for mercy? Let's move on to discuss preparations for the joint ceremony. Thank you for inviting me, Prime Minister. It is my honor to invite you. It wouldn't be easy to reverse everything. It can't be easy to put things back on the right track. Have you noticed that our Chairman treats you like a son? More than a son, I should say! He is working for the benefit of our country! Of course he is. One loses everything if one forgets his patron. What do you think will remain in this country, if we take out our patrons? Japan and the U.S.? The Olympics? The World Cup? That is absolute impudence! It is difficult to convince our people with utilitarianism though. No, don't worry there are plenty of people who will support you. It only seems difficult 'cause of those crazy people who speak about unification and liquidating Japanophiles. Certainly. It is also the duty of a leader to beat his people to come to their senses. Don't worry too much. This competent and young fellow right here has come to help me. We shall all witness how well the Prime Minister will lead our country. It would be more difficult in the future 'cause there will be more crazy and ignorant people who will demand unification. Am I wrong, Prime Minister? No, sir. Correct, indeed. It is indeed a very delightful dinner! You done? Yes, sir. Kyungui Railway, Kyungbu Railway, electricity, harbors, ... The Emperor has handed over a lot more things than I thought. They weren't signed by the Emperor. If the national seal had not disappeared, and if we haven't destroyed the excavated seal, Japan wouldn't be able to present these illegal documents. Didn't you say you destroyed the seal with your own hands? Yes, sir. So what now? Can I... ask you a question? Go ahead. I wish to hear from you about the unification. My opinion about the unification? Yes, sir. What you think about the unification. We should... only if the U.S. and Japan agrees.. Even better if Russia and China agree as well. When do you think those countries will start supporting us? Well... I'm not sure... But someday they will... even if it takes them a century or two. What if they don't agree with us, after a century or two? Then, we shouldn't. Those who talk about the conditions of unification ... are essentially against the unification. You've withessed it yourself! Seclusion from Japan or the U.S. will not be welcomed by any sector? political, economic, cultural... Because they don't want to lose what Japan and the U.S. has provided. Do you think we have overcome poverty through our own endeavors? If we lose our allies it doesn't even take us a decade to become like North Korea. The two Koreas will hug each other and starve to death, if we unify without their support. I was also against the President's rush for unification. However, unification is the desire and destiny of our people. The Korean People. The Korean Peninsula. What is the pride of Korea? Firty centuries of history? A homogeneous country? The morality of not attacking other countries? It is our exclusion for defeatism! Is that why you drugged the President? Because you thought a president with unrealistic ideals wasn't ideal for the country? What makes you think that? I would never do anything extreme like that! Because it was perfect timing It was a perfect scheme to eliminate the seal while the Japanese Navy was in our borders and at the same moment, the President collapses... I agree it was perfect timing that the U.S. and Japan and even myself were all perplexed... No matter what, Japan has demanded their infinite rights to this country and we had to accept it. Although defeated in the war, Japan became powerful enough to claim their rights and we have to accept it. Have you ever thought that if we were annexed to Japan a century ago, we could be enjoying the same rights? Even if your name was Yamamoto or Gurozawa, it doesn't mean you're a different person. Even if your name was Yamamoto or Gurozawa, it doesn't mean you're a different person Can you find the authentic national seal? If my interpretation is correct, the seal is somewhere very close. Can you excavate it on time? I believe in myself. You keep it. 'Cause it might be safer with you. He is no different from yesterday. Were you the first person to see him collapse? Yes, sir. Was he conscious then? No, he had already passed out. Is there anything wrong? Just thinking what perfect timing it was... Tomorrow is the signing ceremony... Is there any possibility of a miraculous recovery? Before the ceremony tomorrow? As of now, that would be impossible. As you can see he's as good as brain-dead so unless there's a miracle, there's no possibility he'll recover. Please do your best. Yes, sir Hello? It's me, CHOI Min-jae. The seal was worth 20 years of my research. Don't you think you were a bit too harsh? I will compensate you enough to make you feel proud about what you've done. Where are you now? Your question should be what will happen in a few hours because firemen will be at the ceremony. By the way, the Director of National Intelligence Service and the Defense Minister send their regards to you. Call for the chief executives and LEE Sang-hyun. Yes, sir. Did you know that CHOI Min-jae was alive? Yes, sir. What?! Why did you try to Kill CHOI Min-jae? What? I thought he was wrong and he would put the country in jeopardy. So, I said, I'd Kill him if I had to. What are you talking about?! Didn't you order me to Kill him because he was right. LEE Sang-hyun!! I wanted to give him the opportunity in case he was right. What about the seal? I eliminated it as I told you. You should cross your fingers that CHOI doesn't cause any trouble. Because you will pay for your consequences whether it was out of sympathy or not. Leave. The best thing to do is to distract the Prime Minister. Foal Eagle, the hawk is on the move. It's been reported that there is a bomb in the building. Everyone must exit the building immediately! What was that? I'll find out, sir. What! The Integrated Government Building exploded? Report to me again when you find out the details. What a disaster! The explosion seems to be more severe than I thought, but the Blue House is safe. Did you find out who's behind this? We've dispatched our men to all the streets and subway stations in Seoul. Double security assigned to the ceremony. Yes, sir. Arrest CHOI Min-jae along with the Director of National Intelligence Service. Yes, sir. The Emperor has ordered to set the palace on fire so that the emissary to Russia can safely leave without Japanese inspection. He sacrificed the palace with a history of 500 years. For the ultimate fate of his people and country. People called it an ominous fire that foretold the downfall of the dynasty. The Japanese failed to inspect the emissary to Russia, thus, it was the heaven's that understood the intentions of our sage Emperor. Although the soul of the dynasty has been shadowed by the clouds, Chosun is the name that suggests a new sunrise from the East. As the 26th Emperor sent from the sun. 25, 26. He establishes the Korean Empire at the age of 47. Although I bury his soul here, it should be resurrected in the future as a new guiding light for our people and, as his subordinate, it is an honor to be given his final duty. It can't be buried too deep. Please restrain from using your hoes after a while. It's no use! Prof. CHOI! Prof. CHOI. If it was here, it would have been recovered by now. It is here! It is here for sure! Mr. President. Can you hear me? Mr. President. It's time to withdraw from here. C'mon, it's no use! I'm not going anywhere until I find the seal. Time's up! We have to go now! The Emperor buried it. No, Sir. KIM Hong-sun by the order of the Emperor buried it here. The seal is here. Stop it! It's the seal! It's the national seal! I found it!! I found the national seal!! Don't you think they're acting strange? Ladies and gentlemen, we shall start the signing ceremony of... um... Before we start the ceremony, Mr. Gurozawa, the Foreign Minister of Japan, will speak briefly. As a representative of Japan, I should say it's an honor for me to speak about the future of the two Koreas and Japan. I believe that the right thing to do is to forget the contract of the Kyungui Railway, and to promote peace and development of Far East Asia. I am not here to give Japan a moral lesson. It is good to hear that you are much better now. It would be terrible if you weren't there for such a wonderful ceremony. But, we're rather puzzled about what you're doing here... We almost feel as though you don't remember what has happened before you collapsed. I think I was dreaming the whole time. I don't remember everything but... it must have been a very long time ago. While I was out by a small pond, a kind-looking man was looking at me. He asked me, "Are you here for a walk?" And I said, "Yes. The sky is beautiful today." He said, Because the Japanese took away our sky, I could not dare to see it. All I could see was the sky through the pond, but the Japanese even took that away. What are you trying to say now? A while ago, you said that this is a wonderful ceremony. In this land a century ago, the Emperor must have felt the same anger when the Japanese said it was wonderful and he could only hope for the best in the future. I thought this was merely a silly incident! Yes, indeed, it was a silly incident... We made a fake seal to buy some time to discover the real one, but a few internal enemies were foolish to steal it. Without any introduction, we have here the best historians from Japan for relic inspection. They are Dr. Guroda and Ganeyama. We invited them in advance so that you can trust their inspection. Even though they're Japanese, we trust their conscience and pride as academics. We shall review all the contracts and treaties that were signed with the inauthentic seal. And we will proclaim the results to the world, and Japan will have to compensate us accordingly. What do you want from us? ... What is the whole idea of calling me a few hours before the joint ceremony? As an ally, Japan shall carefully review the compensation issue and will be active in rectifying the history of the Far East. Tell us the exact amount. How much do you want? The sovereignty of the Korean Peninsula has always been the people of Korea. All we want is a sincere apology of your illegal aggression by the Japanese government and it's people. We have less than 3 hours until the ceremony. The foreign press shall be here an hour before the ceremony. We never intended to violate your sovereignty. Are you saying that the ships are out there at sea on a fishing trip? I, on behalf of the Japanese government and people, sincerely apologize for our mistake in the past and shall promise you to be a fair neighboring country. All fleets return! Sir? It is the order from above. Return immediately! Yes, sir! All fleets must return. Yes, sir. All fleets must return! The Japanese fleets are returning. Congratulations. Congratulations! Congratulations! I rushed a little bit 'cause I thought I would undergo cumbersome procedures... Is this the only way? Yes, sir. No, I don't think so. Our relationship to Japan is agreed upon only in theory. It would take several years to work out the practical affairs. I believe that you are the only one who can do that, Prime Minister. Do you think I'm defeated? I did not fight to defeat the Prime Minister. I am resigning because I believe that in the near future we will fall back more than 30 years due to hopeless politicians. Does my political outlook still look dangerous to you? Just the way you had adhered to yours, I had and will adhere to my faith. Is it really that wrong for a country and her people to stand by themselves? Don't try to convince me. I'm merely one out of an infinite number of people with the same opinion. There will be a second and third me in the future. They shall take my place to teach your big mistake... I mean, your misjudgment. I believe that for those fellows, the 2nd me and Prof. CHOI, and Sang-hyun will prove them wrong. History is about reality! We are creatures that need to eat and we have 48 million of those in this half of the peninsula. I didn't care to be stigmatized as a dirty politician if I could sacrifice my face in exchange for the life of 48 million. I guess, for you, protecting your political ideals and faith was more important. Prime Minister! Prime Minister!
