You. My favorite memories of Sesame Street has got to be the music. I used to sing all the little tunes from Sesame Street, and my mom got me a violin when I was four years old. And of course, the first thing I taught myself was a Sesame Street song. Sleep enough just away on my way to where the air is on my way out. I'm no, not a cockman. Oh, yes, joy. Sure, we can go to the playground later. Oh, hi. Welcome to Sesame Street. Rocco says hi, too. Rocco is my pet rock. He's the best pet in the whole wide world. Oh, yes, you are, Rocco. Oh, he's the best pet. The best pet yet. There's no better pet that you can get than my pet. You bet. He's the best pet in the whole wide world. Yeah. Hey, Zoe. Hi, Jelly. Hey, Rocco. What's happening? Put it there, little buddy. Rocco says he's happy to see you, too, Jelly. Oh, you don't say. Rocco. Hey, you know what Rocco would be if he could sing? What? A rock singer. You laugh at Rocco. That's a funny one. Rock singer. Kelly, rocco can sing. Yeah, he's singing now. He's the best pet. Not bad, I guess, for a rock. In the whole wide world. 1 second. Zoe, did you just sing that Rocco is the best pet in the whole wide world? Yeah, because that's what you are, Rocco, the very best pet in the whole wide world. No, sorry, he's just not. Oh, yes, sure he is. Who's a better pet than Rocco? Well, I'll show you. This is the best pet in the whole wide world. Chucky sue, my hamster. She's the best pet. The best pet? Yes. There's no better pet that you can get than my pet. You bet. She's the best, bestest pet in the whole wide world. Yeah, well, Chucky Sue is really nice. Telly. Nice? She's more than nice. She's athletic. She runs in her little wheel all the time. And she's funny. She can stuff her hamster food in her cheeks until they're all puffy. And she's smart. She can count to 20 by twos. Right, chucky sue. Let's see you count to 20 by twos. Okay, baby, whenever you're ready. All right. Three, four 6810, 1214, 16 1820. Way to go, Chucky. Soon. Wait. Don't joke me. Telly. She didn't count. You did. She was counting in her head. Well, guess what, Rocco? Rocco can sing the alphabet. Yeah, he's a rock singer, remember? Take it away, Rocco. Abcdefghijklmnopqrstobwxynz. Now we know our ABCs. Next time, sing with Rocco and May. Way to go. Yeah. I didn't hear him singing, Zoe. Oh, well, because he was singing in his head, just like Chucky Sue. He doesn't have a head. He's a rock. He does, too have a head. Does not have a head. No, he does not. Hi, Chucky Sue. Oh, she's so cute. Such a cute hamster. Yeah, I know. Say hi to Rocco. Elmo. Hello, Rocco. Rocco just sang the alphabet. Well, Chucky Sue just counted to 20. Well, Rocco is really great at freeze tag. Chucky sue can curl up into a little ball when she goes to sleep. Well, so can Rocco. Well, yeah. I don't think so. Zoe and Kelly, why are you arguing? Zoe thinks Rocco is the best pet in the whole wide world. And Kelly thinks the Chucky Sue is the best pet in the whole wide world. Oh, Elmo gets it. Kelly and Zoe each think they are the best pet in the whole wide world. Yeah. Well, don't worry. Elmo can solve your problem. Elmo knows who's the best pet. Oh, yeah? Who? Elmo has the best pet in the whole wide world. A goldfish. That's right, baby. She's the best pet. The best pet? Yes. There's no better pet than you can get. It almost that. You bet. She's the best pet. Best pet in the whole wide world. Oh, yeah. What can a goldfish do that a hamster can't? Or a rock? Well, lots of things. Dorothy can swim, and she can breathe underwater. She has an incredible imagination. She can even imagine Elmo doing anything right. Dorothy imagine Elmo being a dog. She can even imagine Elmo being a fish. Just like her. Guess what. Rocco's got a great imagination too. Imagine we're in a spaceship flying to the moon. Rocco. See? He imagined it. How do you know? He told me. It's a rock. That's right. And he's the best pet in the whole wide world. Chucky sue. Chucky sue. You guys are yelling too loud. It's upsetting Rocco. Well, it's upsetting Chucky Sue too. Look at him. He's all curled up. Yeah. Dorothy says we should stop arguing. I don't like arguing either. Well, me neither. Yeah. This is a problem. Wait. I have a plan. What? I know how we can stop arguing. How? Let's just all agree that Chucky Sue is the best pet. Excuse me. Hello, everybody. Hey, calm down, everybody. What is the wee little problem here? Well, Chucky Sue is the best pet in the whole wide world. One at a time. Police. Well, Elmo says Dorothy is the best pet in the whole wide world. Chucky sue. Rocco. AHA. So let me get this straight to you. Everybody assembled? Hio. Each thinks that they have the best pet in the whole wide world. Yes. I got it. Good. But have no feel because I am debayo with denso. You know who has the best pet? You see, Elmo, sometimes you need someone outside the wee little problem to help solve it. And that someone is me. Yeah. Okay, let me take a look here. Interesting. Okay. Upon careful observation, it is very clear to me who has the best pet. I'll be right back. Meet Wealthy, my parrot. The best pet in the whole wide world. Yeah. Problem solved. He's the best pet. The best pet? Yes. There's no better pet. Then you can get then? My pet? You bet. He's the best. Bestest pet in a whole wide world. Why is a parrot better than a hamster? Or a goldfish or a rock? Let me count the ways, my friends. Wealthy can make animal sounds so Dorothy. Can make fish sounds if you listen closely. But wealthy can make the sounds of other animals. Wealthy. Hey, wealthy. Make the cow sound. Wait a minute. That's not a cow. That's a rooster. Even Chucky soon knows that. Okay. Hey, wealthy. Oh, how about a horsey sound? Yeah. Dorothy says that's a sheep. I know it's a sheep, Elmo. Okay, wealthy. Wealthy. How about TWIA Duck? Yeah. That'S a horse. Hey, I don't hear any of your pets mooing or cockadoodle doing. Oh, and by the way, I don't believe your pets can talk. But mine can. Say hello, wealthy. Hello, wealthy. See? What I tell you? The best pet in the whole wide world. Best pet? Rocco talks all the time. I don't hear him not listening. It's a rock. Chucky Sue's had baby hamsters. Try and beat that. Well, Rocco has a whole family of pebbles. Wealthy's the prettiest. Says who? Says me. No, you're not holding hold it's a rack. So what? Go. Calm down. What's going on here, Maria? I'll tell you what it is. You see, I happen to have the best pet in the whole wide world. Wealthy. Suit. Come on. Hold it, hold it, hold it. There's an answer to this problem. If Maria is going to bring in another pet, it won't help. No, but even if I did, it still doesn't mean that your pet isn't the best too. What are you saying, Maria? How can there be more than one best pet in the whole wide world? Because you each have the best pet. For you. For Elmo. It's Dorothy. Maria for telly it's Chucky Sue. And for me, it's Rocco. But it's a rock. So what? It's the best pet for Zoe. So, what you're saying here, Maria, is. We all have the best pet. Exactly. See? Problem solved. Hey, listen, our pets are talking. Yeah, they're saying hello. Hello. Dorothy says they're all becoming friends. Gee, if we're friends and all our pets are friends, maybe we should set up a pet playdate. Oh, that's an awesome idea, Chucky. What day should we do it? Tuesday. Tuesday works for Chucky. Soon. Rocco says he has to move something, but it should be okay. Tuesday it is. You know, these are some pretty smart pets. Are you kidding? Maria, music. Thank you. They're the best pets. The best pets? Yes. There's a better pet? You bet. They're the best pack in the whole white world. I love my dog because he's very playful. And if I'm sad, he makes me happy. And he's very cuddly. I take care of my cat because I love him. I hug him and I kiss him. I have a toy cat because I'm allergic to cats. I talk to my fish. It's very funny. I talk to my fish and I also feed my fish. He loves lots of fun. He loves my hamster. Loves me. This is how I take care of sunshine. By feeding it, giving it water, playing with it and walking it. I love my cat because he loves me. Hello there, me Cookie Monster. And once again, me introduce letter of day. Ha. It Be.

You're right, Bird, but what are we going to do? We both want to do different things. Oh, boy, this is a tough one. All right, you know what? We better think about it. Okay, think. Boy. No, wait a minute. What? I know how to solve this. How about first we play a game of tag, and then after we play tag, then we play hide and seek. Wow. Yes. That way we both get to do what we like, and we're both happy. Wow. Did you see how we solved that problem, Bird? Snuffy, it was just your brilliance. Yes, that's true. Bird, you want to sing about it? Oh, that would be a thing of beauty. We worked it out we worked it out we had a problem and talked about it now we're feeling great we didn't scream or shout or stop on our hat bert, we're not wearing hats. We had a chat. Yes, and you. Said this and I said that and we worked it out you're still my friend and now our story has a happy end and if you ask us why we'll say beyond a doubt because we worked it you and me, Bird. Yes, we worked it friends forever we worked it out and next tag. You're it bird. I'm gonna get you, Bird. Steady. Oh, hi. Know what I'm doing? I'm pretending to walk on a tightrope, just like in the circus. It's time to play Ernie. To Ernie, where Ernie hides and Big Bird seeks. Wait. Stop the game. Stop the game. Big Bird or Rubber Ducky and I were wondering if we could try seeking. You mean I hide and you look for me? Right. Okay. Can we do that? Why not? It's time to play Journey to Big Bird. Big Bird hides and Ernie seeks. I wonder where I should hide. Well, I don't know, but you better find a place before we count to ten, or it's going to be a very short game. I think I have an idea. Okay. Are you ready to count, rubber ducky? Okay. And no peaking, Duck. Never mind. 1234-5678, 910. Ready or not, here we come. Wow. Gee, rubber ducky. I don't think we're on Sesame Street anymore. I wonder where Big Bird's hiding. It's hard to think in here. It's such a circus. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to our circus. Well, what do you know? It is a circus where a really. Big, big bird is hiding. Did you hear that? Big Bird is hiding somewhere in the circus. I wonder where. Fuck up. I'm okay. Let's go look around. Wait a second. Did you just see something swing by with yellow feathers? Rubber ducky did too. Let's see here. Big Bird has yellow feathers. We found Big Bird. Wow, this is fun, isn't it, Rubber Ducky? Wait a second. That's no big yellow bird. It's a monkey dressed like a big yellow Bird. Excuse me. Have either of you seen Ernie? No, I'm Ernie. Have either of you ernie yes. Good to meet you, too. Listen, have either of you seen Big Bird? Big Bird? Yeah, big Bird. Big Bird? No. Never asked directions from a two headed clown. Now, where is that bird? Look up again. I'm okay. Okay. Did you hear that? Wow, look at those stilts. I wonder who's up there. Wait. I see yellow feathers. Is that you, Big Bird? Hey, sounds like a cow with yellow feathers. Or a horse or a rooster. Gee, I wonder which one it is. Rubber Ducky, are you a cow, horse or rooster with yellow feathers? Neither. I'm a duck doing animal impression. Quack. That's a duck. Very good. Wow, what an act. Well, I know it's tough, Rubber Ducky, but don't lose hope. Big Bird is tall in something small. No, no, I'm okay. A flying clown clue. He's tall and something small. Hey, could that be Big Bird? No, it's just a giraffe. That's something tall and something tall. Maybe that's him. No, that's just a mouse. That's something small and something small. Hey, now that car is small. But how could someone as tall as Big Bird fit in something so small? Will you hurry up and look in the car? Did you hear that? That sounded like Big Bird. It's really small in here. Gee, do you think Big Bird could be in there? Yeah, I know, but it's so teeny tiny. And he's the biggest bird we know. I mean, he's so big. So really, really big. Hey, such a. Big bird. I was getting really squished in there. We found him. It's Big Bird. It's me I know you any place 8ft of yellow feathers that beak upon your face your happy Big Bird voice tells us you're the one we found him we found him our journey to Big Bird is gone. Whoa. That was fun. I liked hiding. And rubber ducky. And I like seeking. What's that? Oh, and squeaking. That's a game, too. Hide and squeak. Okay, this may seem like a ridiculous question, but what are you doing? Oh, I'm teaching Bernice here how to play checkers. Your move, Bernice. Bernice, your move. You're teaching a pigeon to play checkers? That's amazing. That's the most incredible thing I've ever heard of. Bernie, it's no big deal. No big deal? Why, a pigeon that can play checkers? That must be the smartest pigeon in the whole world. Well, she's really not that smart. Ernie not that smart. Bert, how can you say that? Well, in the ten games we've played, she's only beaten me twice. Okay, Bernice, go ahead. Your move. Hello there. Hit design, your cute, furry and exhausted world traveling monster. I have just returned from another one of my trips to a faraway place. This time, I went to a country called Jordan. See this beautiful, albeit bulky, basket? My friend Amira and her cousin Mahmoud live in Jordan, they make these baskets, and they showed me how rough them. And hurry. This was the day that the mirror and Mahmud's grandmother was going to teach them how to make baskets. And do you know what they make baskets from? Believe it or not, the baskets are made from old, dried up banana leaves. Yes, I kid you not. You see the bananas hanging on the tree? Well, the banas are to eat, but the leaves on the banana tree are not to eat. The leaves dry up, and the people cut them off the tree. All the women in their village get together and make baskets that they will sell in the marketplace. First, they make the leaves into braids, and then the braids are woven together into a basket. Grandma showed Amira and Mahmoud how to do it. Amira was so proud. She thanked her grandma for teaching her. And see this? This was Amira and Mahmoud's very first basket, made all by themselves. They gave it to me to show to you. And while we were making the basket, I helped a little bit. We ate a lot of bananas. I did not want to make a mess, so I put all the banana peels into this basket here. I will show you. That is a lot of banana peels, is it not? Now, I know you think I'm going to do the cheap trick and slip on a banana peel. Well, AHA, comedy 101 is to laugh. No, this is a very serious talk on how to make. Wow. They are very slippery. Steady. Steady there. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. This just goes to prove you should never put all your banana peels into one basket. Whoa. Hello. Bye bye. And it's one, two, three night you're out at the old game. Yes, it's that day at the cow's castle. Ha. Yes. And on that day, my little batty bat pals here help us find the number of the day. Sasha misha grisha. Are you ready, my little Batnick? The number of the day. Is it one? One. Is it two? Two. Is it 334-455-6677? This a spence is driving me bats. Is it eight? Eight. Yes. Eight. Oh, look, eight. Bat. 1234-5678. La la la la, elmo's world. La la la la, elmo's world almost hit those fish. His crayon, too. Yeah. That Elmo's world. Hi. This is Elmo's World. Oh, Elmo's, so happy to see you. And so is Dorothy. Say hello, Dorothy. Guess what Elmo's thinking about today's. Water splashing. Let's see, please. Oh, hi there, Elmo. Hi, Ernie. Robert Ducky.

Look, Dorothy's been thinking about bath time, too, and Dorothy has a question. What is it? Okay, Dorothy, here we go. What do you need to take a bath? What do you need to take a bath. A bathtub? Right, Mr. Noodle. You take a bath in the tub, and it's full of water. Make sure it's not too hot. Oh, cool. The bathtub is all ready for a bath. So what do you need to take a bath, Mr. Noodle? You need to go get a washcloth. No, those are skis. Oh, boy. Mr. Noodle. No. Mr. Noodle. You can't take a bath like that. Mr. Noodle. Stop. No, mr. Noodle, that's for skiing. Skis are for the snow. You don't use them in the bath. You need skis to ski. What do you need to take a bath, Mr. Noodle? Try again. Mr. Noodle. What's that? I think they're for swimming. Yeah, like in the ocean or a pool. No, Mr. Noodle. You don't use them when you take a bath. You take a bath to get washed and clean. It's okay, Mr. Noodle. That's it. Good job. Mr. Noodle. You need something to get nice and clean. He has a towel to drag yourself off. And what's that? Mr. Noodle? What is that? It's a bath brush so he can scrub his back. That's good. That's what you need to take a bath. Yay. Mr. Duke, what are you doing? Mr. Noodle? Why is he putting on that hat? So his hair won't get wet, Mr. Noodle. Not with all your clothes on. He's all wet. Mr. Noodle, you have all your clothes on. You have to take your clothes off to take a bath. Yeah. Oh, Mr. Noodle. Silly. Noodle, he's all wet. Mr. Noodle gave his clothes a bath. What's that, Dorothy? Dorothy wants to ask someone else. What do you need to take a bath, Darcy? This is how I take a bath. With soap, a washcloth, and watery. I like to take a shower to get clean and to use a nice dry towel to dry myself when I'm finished. Thanks, everybody. Thanks, Dorothy. Now, elmo ask a baby. Oh, you're all wet. Hi, Mommy. Hi, baby. Baby, what do you need to take a bath? Oh, yeah. Water, soap, and POW. And Mommy. Oh, thank you, baby. Bye bye. Bye, Mommy. Now, Elmo has a question for you. Yeah, you.

Isn't that something? Look at that. That's the way cats get clean. They lick themselves all over. Look at that. Look at that. He's washing his face now, Delilah. Murray Sparkles, you must have the cleanest face in the whole world. And the cutest face, too. Hey, wait. What are you doing? I already had my bath today. That's a rough tongue you got there. Bye, elbow. Thanks, computer boy. Even kitties take baths. That makes Emma wonder what else takes a bath. Let's find out. Oh, draw. Emily is flashing. Is somebody taking a bath and draw? No, Emo doesn't see anything. Do birds get back? Yes, but not in the bathtub. In a bird bath. Oh, your daddy said bath. Yeah, but they need help. Your car said bath. Not in a bathtub. Yeah, in a car wash. Do worms take baths? No. Unless it's slimy. He takes mud baths. Thanks, Troy. Elmo's friend Juliana loved giving her horsey Sarah bath, and she told Elmo all about it. Oh, do you want to watch Judge Roy? Okay. My horse Sarah gets dirty and needs to be washed. So my mom taught me how to give her a bath. First, we rinsed her legs with warm water so she could get used to it. We slowly moved the hose up to her neck and got her whole body wet, but not the face. Then my mom showed me how to wash her with shampoo and a sponge. We washed her neck, her back underneath her, and we were careful with her legs. And we washed her mean soup. It's kind of like washing your hair. Then came the towel. After that, we rinsed her all over with some more warm water. We washed the face last. We have to be very gentle. We used warm water and a special face sponge, but no shampoo. It was time to dry her, so we scraped the water off with a scraper. Then we used a towel to dry her off some more. But she was still a little wet, so we walked her around for a while and let the sun dry her the rest of the way. Sarah was very shiny. I love my horse. But sometimes she rolls in the dirt. Oh, no. We'll have to start over again. Boy, Juliana's horse Sarah must really love taking baths. But now Elmo wants to learn even more about bath time. Don't you? How can we find out even more? Oh, yeah. We can watch the Bath Time channel. Turn yourself on. TV. Welcome to the Bath Time Channel. All baths, all the time. We're all washed up. And now it's time for a bath with the bath lady, Bubbles Martin. Hi there. Bubbles Martin here, and as you can see, I'm taking a bath. Bath time is my favorite time of day. I love washing. Hey, you want to wash, too? You don't have to be taking a bath. You can pretend it's the next best thing. Okay, everybody wash. Everybody wash your hands. Everybody wash your face.

Coming up next on the Bath Time Channel, bath Masterson, starring Sophie Sales. Bath time. Oh, boy. How can we find out more? Who could that be? Want to talk to a bathtub? Oh, yeah. We can talk to a bathtub. So, what is it like being a bathtub bathtub? It's kind of draining. So how does bathtub work? Well, you turn on the water with my faucets here. See? Right here. And you turn the faucets to make sure nice, warm water comes out of my spout up there. Make sure it's not too hot, Elmo. Yeah. Of course, some folks prefer showers. So the water could also flow from my shower head up there. Yeah, cool. No, warm. Nice and warm. But, you know, Elmo, you don't need a bathtub to get clean. You don't? No. There are no bathtubs out in nature. But animals can still get clean. Even a little mouse. Yeah. Oh, look, look. Daughter's imagining Elmo as a little mouse in nature getting clean. Elmo mouse is getting squeaky clean. Squeak, squeak, squeak. Big elephants get clean too. Oh, boy. Shower time. We love to sing we love to sing in the shower we love the way that our singing sound in here. Here. Oh, yes. We love the way that our singing sounds in here. Yes, there's nothing like singing to keep the pipes from rusting. Oh, good. Because Dorothy wants to sing the bath time song. The halftime song. Oh, that makes me feel a warm and bubbly bin. Sing with Elma. Yeah. Bath time. Bath time. Bath time. Bath time. Back time. Everybody sing best time, best time. Best time. Best time. Best time. Best time. Best time. Best time, best time.
