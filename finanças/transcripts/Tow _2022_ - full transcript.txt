One, two three, four. I declare a thumb war. Five, six, seven, eight. Try to get a thumb shake. Abi! Help! Abi, don't leave me! Abi! One of the worst serial killers of the 21st century, simply known to most of us as The Mechanic, will pay the ultimate price for his crimes. The state has set to levy his final punishment at 8:30 p.m. local time. After serving 20 years on death row, Randall Jackson will be executed tonight, giving final closure to one of our nation's most tragic moments. The brutality of his crimes will never be forgotten. Twenty-six victims in all. The only two victims to survive his deadly killing spree were twins Abigail and Madeleine Monroe, who lost their parents that fateful night at the Cedar Creek murders. Neither Abigail or Madeleine were available for comment. The only request from Randall Jackson was to face death by electrocution. When prison guards went to his cell this morning they found Mr. Jackson's hands and fingers scrapped down to the bone. On the prison walls he scrolled the same occult symbols that were his trademark calling card of his crime scene 20 years ago. Randall Jackson never denied the killings. The state appointed attorneys for the defendant received multiple stays of execution over the years on the grounds of insanity. A defense that Mr. Jackson categorically denied. The legacy of The Mechanic will go down in history as one of the most atrocious killers of the 21st century. Hi, this is Abi. Don't leave a message after the beep. - Goddamn it, Abi. Where the hell are you? And we will never forget the brutality brought on by The Mechanic. Hey, this is Ethan. Don't leave a message after the beep. You heard her. Hey, Ethan and Abi, please call me back. Please stop avoiding me. Abi, we said we'd still go to Cedar Creek today. I'd still really like to connect. Please don't ignore me. ...and put an end to the legacy... Just call me back, okay? It's urgent. Mr. Jackson refused his final meal and further refused to have a pastor or a spiritual advisor present at his execution. But he did share his final words this morning and I quote, "I'll see you in your dreams." Once again Randall Jackson, The Mechanic, will be executed tonight. Our thoughts and prayers go out to the victim's families and of course Monroe sisters Please stay safe out there. We thank you for tuning in to the morning news. Until next time.. Hey! - Hello! Hey, I... I'm in here. Hello. Hey. Hey. Hey, hey, hey. Can you help me out? Come on. Hey. Yeah. Hey. I-I'm stuck. I can't get out. I need you to stop the truck. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's, that's it. That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it. ...a few worst killers that scar our past. What's taking so long? Hey. Thank you so much. You are a life save... - Oh. Oh, shit! Oh! and I quote, "I'll see you in your dreams." It's the reoccurring dream. It's the third or fourth night in a row this dream has happened. He's finally being executed, you know. This is gonna bring about a lot of emotions, stress and memories for the both of you. How does Abi seem about his execution? Maddie, you know I can't talk about my other patients. Please, she's my other half. Um, she's distant. - She doesn't wanna go to sleep. - Yeah. Now I know how she feels. Maddie, you and your sister have been seeing me about this trauma for years. - This is not anything new. - No, this is new. This is different. The dreams are-are more real, more intense. It's like I'm being dragged to sleep and no matter how hard I try, I can't stay awake. It's not like it's lucid dreams either. I can't control anything. I'm just a prisoner in this maze. It's like ever since the date of the execution was set... I feel like these dreams are leading to something. I just don't know what. I can prescribe you something. - To stay awake? - To sleep. No. God, no. Are you crazy? Sorry. The idea of falling. Asleep is terrifying What about Abi's dreams? Did she mention anything about a tow yard? I thought you two weren't talking? We're not. But, Tom... in this dream I'm her. I'm Abi. In the dream, her hair, her awful clothes and that terrible car of hers. Um, could it be guilt? Guilt that he grabbed her and not you. No, I don't think that. W-what I think is weird, is that the moment she disappeared I became her in my dreams. W-what if, what if... W-what if she's right? What if it's more than just dreams? What could it possibly be? - My sister thinks that... - Maddie... That-that he's still after us. - Not this again. - Yes. Yes, this again. I'm surprised to be hearing it from you. Me too. Trust me. Me too. I'm just not so sure she's wrong. How could he possibly still be after you? You know the crap he's into. That occult shit. Casting spells? And what would these spells do? The hell do I know, Tom! We're supposed to go to Cedar Creek to make our peace. Have a moment, reconnect. But I can't reach her though. - Have you talked to her? - Not since our last session. This isn't just Abi just ignoring me. This is different. Her phone's been off. And Ethan's not answering his either. Yeah. Sure. I'll-I'll call her. Thank you. Hi, this is Abi. Don't leave a message after the beep. H-hey, Abi. This is Tom and Maddie. Just checking in. Um, give either of us a call back. Okay? Thanks. Bye-bye. My time's up. Maddie, I don't have another patient for some time. Th-there's no need to rush out the door. If you hear from her, will you let me know? - I feel like I let her down. - Maddie. Stay. Let's talk. I can't talk anymore, doc. I feel like I'm going in circles. Maddie. Come back to the office. You don't seem well. I don't like you leaving like this. No, I-I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm gonna head over to Cedar Creek, maybe she's already there. I'm fine. Trust me. Okay. Your sister's calling again. - Ignore it. How long are you gonna ignore her? Until she believes me. What exactly do you think you're gonna find out here? This is where it all started. Now, there's, there's something here. There's definitely something here. - Yeah, The Mechanic has not... - Ethan! Sorry. Sorry. He-Who-Shall-Not-Be-Named. This isn't funny. I know, babe. But he's been in prison for 20 years. And the cops raided this place forever ago. What do you think you're gonna find that they didn't? They didn't look for the right things. They didn't take that supernatural stuff seriously. No one did. There's, there's gotta something here that'll just help me stop... Yeah, your dreams? Yeah, my dreams, Ethan. They're just dreams. He's in prison. He's about to be executed. He can't hurt you. It's physically impossible. - You're safe. - No, I'm not! I'm not safe! I haven't been safe for so fucking long. You sound just like Maddie and Tom... - Oh, come on. - Everybody else. That is not fair. Abi, this is a bad idea. Do not go in there. Then don't come. A... Abi. I'm waiting outside. Hi, this is Abi. Don't leave a message after the beep. One, two three, four. I declare a thumb war. Five, six, seven, eight. Try to get a thumb shake. Abi, don't leave me! Abi! Abi, don't leave me! Abi! Abi, don't leave me! Abi. Maddie! Maddie! Maddie! One, two three, four. I declare a thumb war. Five, six, seven, eight. Try to get a thumb shake. Honey, how much longer do you think we have to wait for this tow truck? Any minute now. Any minute. Ah, there he is! All right. Hang tight. Maddie. Abi. Quit it. Thank you. I know it's been a long night, we'll be home soon. - What's taking so long? - I don't know. Maybe I should go check it out. There he is! - Is he okay? - Yeah, he's walking weird. - Oh, my God! - Mom! - What's he doing? - Oh, my God! It's okay. It's okay. It'll be okay. Run! Abi! Abi, don't leave me! Abi, help! Help! Abi, don't leave me here! Mom! No! Let go! Maddie! Maddie! - Maddie, help... It's okay! You're safe now. Hi, this is Abi. Don't leave a message after the beep. - Abi, I'm at Cedar Creek. I was hoping you'd show up like we promised. I'm gonna wait for a while, okay? In case you do show up. Abi! Abi, let's just go home! Abi. Abi, Abi. Abi, Abi. Hey, hey. Hey. Hey, what happened? - Are you okay? Hey. Come on. Oh, my God. - Hey! Hey! Help me! Hello! Come on. Over here! Hello! ...zig-zagging all over the damn road. - Fuck you. - Shit! Drink it so can get going. Oh, yes. Come on. Come on. You guys seeing this? Come on. - Hey, dickhead! - Something's up, man. Hey, can you help me? You need to get me out of the car. What the hell are you doin' in there? The doors are locked or jammed! They won't open. I don't know what's going on. There's a guy, he's crazy. You have to hurry, this guy he will kill us. - Who's going to kill us? - The tow truck driver! Hey, look, just relax, okay? I'm trying to tell you, the guy is a psychopath. She's hopped up on something, Russ. What are you now, afraid of her? - I'm afraid of crazy. - I'm not crazy. If you will just listen to me please. We are running out of time. He's going to come back. Hey, don't worry about it, all right? Let's just break this fucking window, man. - Yes, thank God. I've tried. - Hey, hey. You're not the one facing his third strike. He's right. We don't need to - break the window. - What? We're not gonna break your window. - Okay? We can get this open. - No, no. It's my car. You can break it. - It's okay. - Hey. This guy, see where he went? Yeah, he-he went in the building. - What're you doing? - I'm gonna check it out. No, I told you, it is not safe. And I told you, don't worry about it. Probably scared his ass off already anyway. I can't get that. Could you pop the hood? - Yeah. - Up here in the front. You see anything, Russ? Everything looks pretty normal to me. - Give it a try. - Okay. It's not working. All right. We might actually have to break a window. Hey. Shouldn't your friend be back by now? - What's that? - Your friend! Shouldn't he be back by now? Yeah. She's right. Hey, Matt, you see what's taking him so long to get back here. All right, I'm gonna break it. I'm gonna knock it out. Can you cover yourself up with something? - Okay, yeah. - Exactly. Perfect. Good. Okay. Cover your eyes. One, two... He came back! Help! Help! Help! - Help! Help! Help! - Russ! - He's out there! - Russell! - Please, he's out there! Please. I just saw him! He's out here! He went that way. He went that way. No, no, no, don't go, don't go, don't go. No, stay here. Don't go. No, please. No, don't go, don't go, don't go, don't go, don't go. No, no, no, no, no. Stop! Please, stop! No! Oh. Thank God. Oh, why? Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, God. Okay. Okay. Come on. What about Abi's dreams? Did she mention anything about a tow yard? Abi! Abi! Abi! Abi! Abi! Okay. God. Oh, come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Oh. - Hey! - Hi. You're on private property. I-I'm sorry. - Might wanna move along. - Yeah, sure. - Hello? - Hi. - Is this Madeleine Monroe? - Yeah. This is Detective Scrim. I'm calling in regard to your sister Abigail. Is she all right? Well, if you could meet us at St. John's Hospital, we need to ask you a few questions. Hi, this is Tom. I can't get to the phone right now. Please leave a message and I'll get back to you as soon as I can. If this is a medical emergency please hang up and call 9-1-1. - Hey, Tom. It's Maddie. I just got a call from a detective. Abi is at St. John's Hospital. I'm gonna head over there now. Do you think you could meet me there? Let me know. - Ms. Monroe? - Yeah. Where's my sister? I'm gonna need for you to answer a few questions for us first. Not until I see her. Dr. Kravis, you have a visitor in the main lobby. Dr. Kravis, a visitor in the main lobby. Abigail is caught on security footage attacking three bikers. She appears to have attacked her husband as well. It wasn't her. Is there something I should know? No, it's just... My sister? Three bikers, come on, how does that sound to you? Ms. Monroe, we have the evidence. Given the nature of the killings and their relation to Randall Jackson, who's on the heels of his impending execution, we're having a very difficult time understanding Abi's motives here... Copycat killings? At the scene of the crime, she left the same occult symbols as The Mechanic did 20 years ago. They also match the symbols he's been obsessively drawing in his jail cell. This must be very difficult for you. And you think she tried to do this to her husband too? At the moment she is the leading suspect in that crime as well. And of another roadside murder. In all three cases, the same occult symbols. It wasn't her. I know this isn't easy to process, but the evidence is... - Screw your evidence. - Miss. No! You don't understand. You didn't watch your parents get murdered before your eyes. You didn't escape the hands of a psycho. - I understand. - No, you don't! He-he grabbed her! And he did something to her! That-that night he did something to her and-and that's what all this is! It's still him! Please. Look, it... I know this sounds crazy... It's not crazy! I see him, I see him everywhere. The dreams are so real. I feel like I'm never going to sleep. I'm starting to wonder what's real. Goddamnit, Maddie! He's doing some dark arts, voodoo bullshit! What do you think those things are that he draws? That he's just doing them for fun? He's a sick man! No shit. But they're not just random scribbles. There's a method to his madness. Some satanic shit, dealing with the occult. Those symbols have meaning and he's creating some kind of eternity or afterlife. The execution is gonna set him free. Wake up, Maddie. It's only the beginning of this nightmare for us. Eternity? Abi... How do you explain this? What did you do to yourself? You think I did this to myself? This was him! Okay. This is all been so hard, for both of us. The date of his execution was just set. When it happens let's go to Cedar Creek, make our peace, and finally put this behind us. You're not listening! Abi, he's in prison. He can't get to you. Please stop this. It's really hard. I know. I'm sorry. We got away. He's not done with us. He's never been done with us. In your dreams, that's where you can't escape him. In your dreams, that's where you can't escape him. Excuse me? Um, could I see my brother-in-law, please? Of course. He's one floor down. Thank you. Ethan. Ethan. Ethan. You, you stay the hell away from me. I don't wanna hurt you. I don't care. Get back. Oh, my God, Ethan, what did my sister do to you? Get back. Wait now. This is exactly how it happened with Abi. - Get away. Stop! - Ethan. You have it too, don't you? Show me your hand. - No. - Show me your... - Open it up! - No! You have the burn too, don't you? - No. No, please. - Let me see. Oh, my gosh! Ma'am? Ma'am? Can I get some help over here? Oh, God... No, no! No! You piece of shit! You freak! Why are you... No! Please. Please. No! I'm in here. Hello! Hey! Help! Help! Help! Okay. How do you like it now, huh? How do you like it now, huh?! Abi. Abi! Abi! Abi! Ethan? - Abi! Abi! Abi! Abi! - Ethan! - Ethan! - Get me out of here. Okay. Come on. - Abi! Abi! Abi! - Ethan. Ethan. Hold on, hold on. You got to find something. I'm gonna try and pry it open, okay? One, two, three! Oh! Oh... Oh, you-you're not Abi. - No, Ethan. No, no, no. - No, what'd you do with Abi? I don't know. It's really confusing. - Wait, don't touch me! I... - Shh! Shh! - Go away. It's not that I ca... - Ethan, Ethan... - How did you get here? - How did I get here? Abi... Abi brought me here. - Ethan, please. Shh! Shh! - Don't, don't! - Don't touch me! - Ethan, please! Don't... Oh, no! Ethan! Ethan! Ethan. Ethan. Whoa! Ethan, what're you doing? - It's too late. - No, no, no. You, Abi, The Mechanic, you're, you're all becoming the same thing. No. Ethan, we can stop him. Okay, just put the gun down. Ethan, don't. Ethan, don't hurt yourself. Come on. We can get out of here. We can stop him. Please, I need you. Please. Please! Ethan! Ethan. Ethan, he could be anywhere. Please. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh... Hi. I'm here to see Madeline Monroe. Tom! Hey! Ahh! Tom! Tom! Maddie? Maddie. What the hell are you doing here? - Looking for you. - You crazy? Just-just stay here. Tom. - Tom. Where're the keys? - What? He took 'em. He took my keys. - Come on. - Oh! - We got to get out of here. - Okay. Dr. Jay Hamilton. Dr. Jay Hamilton. What if she's right? What if it's more than just dreams? What could it possibly be? - My sister thinks that... - Maddie. That-that-that he's still after us. - Not this again. - Yes. Yes, this again. How could he possibly still be after you? You know the crap he's into. That old cult shit! Casting spells? And what would these spells do? The hell do I know, Tom? Maddie. Maddie, wake up. - Oh, come on! Check the battery. The battery. That one. Why don't you just start the car for me, okay? Okay. Okay. Come on. Okay. Okay. Try it now. - Get me the paddles. - Code blue. - Code blue. - Yes! Yeah, yes! Maddie. Maddie, wake up. Maddie, wake up. Clear! - Maddie, wake up. Maddie, wake up. Maddie? I'm here. Maddie. What's going on? Talk to me. You can talk to me. Talk to me. Talk to me. I'll see you in your dreams.
