Where is A-Hai? He roughed up a bunch of my guys. I got rid of him. Get out of the way! You got to be a good person out there. No more fighting. Okay. Go on. Hi. Are you eating alone? I'm looking for Kai. Feng! When did they let you out? Why didn't you tell me? I could have gone to pick you up. Come here. This is my wife, Beautiful. Beautiful, this is Feng, the guy I'm always telling you about. Come here. Your father didn't go pick you up? I can't believe so many years have passed. You heard any news about A-Hai? A- Hai works for the gangs now. He's the top fighter out there. But I haven't seen him in years. Feng, you just got out. Why don't you stay here at my place for a while? Sorry, give me a second. Honey, sweetie, listen to me Honey! Get out of my way. Sweetie! Feng just got out of prison, he has no place to go. No way. The streets are full of beggars like him. You planning to take them all in? Oh come on. It's just for a few days. I said no! Keep your voice down. I've known Feng since we were peeing in our diapers Just a few days... No! Excuse me, are you hiring? Sure, but only for labourers. Can you handle hard work? Sure. This guy just got out of prison. In that case we've got no use for him. Get him out of here. Sorry, I checked for you, but all of our jobs have just been filled. Oh. That's ok. Thanks anyway. Sorry about that. Thieves! Stop them! Stop! Stop them! Stop! What's the matter cutie, you got a thing for me and my bros? You followed us all the way here. Whoa! You've got some moves girl! Shut up and hand me the bag! Who are you? Why are you holding me? Wait. I want to ask you something. A second ago, when I was passed out, did you or those punks take advantage of me? Forget I asked. Pull! Harder! That bastard Chen! He only brought the two of us and he's over there just running his mouth. I can't stand looking at that face of his. Stop whimpering and pull! Put that fat ass of yours to good use! Put some muscle into it! I'm doing all the work. Hey Bobo, I thinkt here's something wrong with the rope. Huh? How come it's not moving? Hey Chen! Looks like there's something wrong with the rope. Let's try pulling it a little harder this time. It's not budging. Get out of the way! Hey little guy, it's okay. Hey kid, run on home. What the hell is wrong with you two? Why didn't you check the rope carefully? You see how dangerous it is. Thank you very much. It was nothing. By the way, do you need extra workers? This is our company storage room. You can live here for now. Straighten it up a bit if you like. Okay. Don't forget to be at work at 8:30 tomorrow morning. Thanks. Good morning. Morning. It's your first day on the job and you show up late. Bobo, here you are. Mr. Chen said to be here at 8:30. 8:30? 8:30 is for me and Bobo. We are senior-grade workers here. You are a newbie, so you have to show up at 8. Alright. Forget about it. This time I'll let it slide. Now listen here. When you go somewhere new, you have to understand the rules. Anyone who gets under Bobo's good graces should consider himself very lucky. Huh? Get over here. You know who this guy is? Have you heard of 'The Street Fighter'? Bobo and 'The Street Fighter' are sworn brothers. I'm talking about that badass Feng Yue who killed a guy when he was only 16. You know him? Know him? Ha, it's much deeper than that. We are sworn brothers on an oath of blood! That's right. The day he killed that guy, Bobo was there and took a knife for him. The wound was this long! Good thing, Bobo has plenty of padding. Oh yeah, the scar is here. I'll let you look. Bobo, let him take a peek. Where there are people, there is strife. And where there is strife, there is life on the streets. But all this talk about me is in the past now. Bobo, let the past stay in the past. Right, but there's one thing that has never changed with me. I always treat these brothers in arms that followed me as my own family. Look, Bobo's thirsty. Hurry up and go buy some beer for him. Go on! Be quick about it! That kid you killed didn't have any parents but his old grandmother is still alive. Fighting is all about being ruthless. One time I took on over 20 guys by myself. They were all twice my size. But that didn't stop me. Why? My strike is deadly. I grabbed the first guy I could and went ballistic on him. Everyone else watched and started pissing in their pants. They didn't dare to make a peep. What the? How dare you fall asleep while I'm talking? Go get me some beer. If I remembered correctly, Bruce Lee could only take on 10 or so guys. Even Mike Tyson wouldn't be much of a match for me. If you keep training like this even Bruce Lee and Mike Tyson wouldn't dare square off with you. Bruce Lee belongs to the screen, and Tyson to the ring. But I belong to the street. Only street fighting is real fighting. In real fight, your fist is the only true friend you can trust. As for me, I want to become the toughest guy on the streets. What about me? Am I a friend you can trust? That's hard to say. Who knows, maybe one day we'll end up like those fighters in the movies who have to fight to the death. Get all the stuff out. Thank you for supporting our orphanage. Don't mention it. Our company just changed out our computers, so I figured I'd bring the old ones for the kids to use. Mr. Liu, on behalf of the kids here I offer our sincerest gratitude. Hey slowpoke, get over here. This guy got some muscle, doesn't he! Hey slowpoke. Slowpoke! What are you doing just standing there? Hurry up and put the stuff in the room! Hurry up! Don't put it on the ground. Put it on the table. What the hell is wrong with you? You are always so careless. Slowpoke, get in there and set up the computers for them. Hurry up. Slowpoke. What the hell are you doing? Why can't you be more careful? You know how much this computer costs? Are you going to pay for it yourself? Don't just stand there. Apologize to them! That won't be necessary. Thanks for your help today at the orphanage. I was just doing the right thing. There's something I've been wanting to ask you. Then ask. That first time we met, when I was knocked unconscious, what happened afterwards? You can tell me now, can't you? Nothing happened. Nothing? So how long have you been working at the orphanage? A little over a year. This orphanage has never had it easy. Can you tell me about it? Ofcourse. It's a private orphanage. Mr. Zhou doesn't have any children of his own. At first he adopted two kids. Later, more and more orphans were brought to him for help. Mr. Zhou ended up selling all of his family belongings to get the orphanage off the ground. Why didn't Mr. Zhou apply for financial support? He didn't want the children to be like products put on show, so he decided the orphanage would only accept personal donations. Mr. Zhou must be a really nice guy. I think you are a really nice guy too. Hello? Slowpoke Me and Shuai ran into a little trouble here at the NH bar on Qingnian Road. We need some money quick. Round up some money and bring it to us ASAP! What happened? Cut the bullshit! Just bring us the money. Hurry up! Ok, I'll be there soon. It's nothing. But I need to go. Thank you for the lovely dinner. Wait. Give me your phone. Call me sometime. Okay. Fat ass, you're pretty tough, aren't you? Coming into my place and hitting on my girl. You say you can take on 20 guys by yourself? Ha! The Street Fighter. So which one of you is the Street Fighter then? I was just shooting the shit! Oh, don't be modest now friend. It won't be easy for me to find 20 guys for you to beat up, but how about practicing with a few of my buddies again. Come on man, please don't joke around. Who's joking around? If you don't get me the money tonight, I'm gonna cut you up real good Fatty. Boss, someone's here looking for Bobo. Who the hell is Bobo? Me... that's me. It must be my friend bringing me the money. Wait for me in the other room. Where's the money? I don't have it. You don't have it? Are you going to let my friends go now? I'll fucking let you go! You going to let my friends go? Boss, why did you let them go that easy? You ever heard of "The Street Fighter"? Nope. You ever heard of a "Bare-Handed Bottle Break"? Nope. Nope, nope, nope! What the fuck do you know, anyways?! When you have some free time, would you be willing to volunteer with me at the orphanage? Yi "Sure. " Get out of the way! Fight! Some of these kids were abandoned because they had disabilities. Some of them just because they were girls abandoned by their parents. I hope in the future there are less and less kids like this. Don't worry, hope is always right around the corner. Before I used to think that life had landed these kids in bad hands. But Mr. Zhou says in life there is no such thing as fair and unfair. He says don't waste our precious time on things that can't be changed. What's your name little guy? His name is Qiang. He's deaf. Son, don't be scared. Dad's going to take you to the hospital, okay? Hang in there. They will make you all better at the hospital. Daddy's boy is so strong. Stand still. You're not a kid anymore, so why do you still act like one? You spend all your time out in the streets fighting. Can't you even try to make me proud? You can't wait to give your old man a heart attack, huh? What the hell do you think you'll be able to do in the future? If you keep this shit up, you will be a worthless pile of trash. Fine, I'm trash. So what! You think you can take care of yourself? You think fighting is going to put food on the table? Then get the hell out of my house! Fine. I can't wait to go. But let me tell you something. I'm going to live the way I wanna live. I'm going to prove my worth something. Not like you, kissing up to everyone and living at the whim of other people. You little bastard! I work damn hard to feed your sorry ass. Now get the hell out of my house! And don't ever come back! What do you want? Who let you in here? Yi, let them come inside. So what is it going to be, Mr. Zhou? Did you make up your mind yet? You ready to agree in our company's conditions? Sorry. I'm not going to sell this land. The price you are offering in the contract is much lower than the actual value of the land. Biao, stand off. Mr. Zhou You know what Mr. Lee's company is capable of. Mr. Lee's son has already set his sights on this property. So you best think things over very clearly. Watch yourself old man. Are those people from Mr. Lee's company? If we don't sell, will they try to tear this place down anyway? His company has too much influence and power. And this land the orphanage sits on is right in the center of the resort they plan to build. They won't give up easily. We can take them to court. This is a commercial business case and we would have no resources to fight them in court. At my age I don't care much if they win the fight, but if we lose the orphanage, where are these kids supposed to go? Watch your step ma'am. Did you see something fly by just now? Well, did you? You have changed. Everybody changes. Life on the inside took off some of your edge, but it doesn't seem to have slowed you down at all. Prison definitely doesn't make a person weaker. Come work with me. It's been 8 years. I've been waiting for you a long time. We're the same kind of person, the kind that lives by the fist. A- Hai, I hear you're working with the gangs these days. You have made quite a name for yourself. In this materialistic age, it's all about survival of the fittest. Only with money and rule of the fist can you get everything you want. A- Hai Why has my own experience not taught you anything? Why do you still live this way? I owe you a great debt, I hope someday I can do something to repay you. You don't owe me anything. We are like brothers. I just want to live a simple life now. I respect that. But if you run into any trouble, come find me. I will. If you change your mind, call me anytime. Over here. Hey! Young man, you always buy so much. Can you eat all this by yourself? Ma'am How many times have I told you, you are not allowed to sell street food here. I'm sorry. This time we're going to have to fine you, otherwise you'll keep coming back. No, please don't. I'm leaving right now. Excuse me gentlemen. I'm sorry. Let's step over here. Listen guys. This poor old woman doesn't have it very easy. How about I pay the fine for her and we'll be on our way immediately. You know, we have parents as well, and we know it's not easy for you two. Right. But this is our job. I know. Okay, you two get going then. Yes sir. Have a good day. Ma'am, don't let me see you selling here again. Yes sir. Let's go. Okay. Thank you young man. If my grandson were still alive, he would be the same age as you. Ma'am, if you don't mind, you can think of me as your grandson. Mr. Zhou, Mr. Zhou. Come quickly! What happened? Mr. Lee's company wants to buy the orphanage land to build a resort. Mr. Zhou has refused to sell, so they are trying to intimidate us. Did you report it to the police? We did, but we don't have any proof. Now, all the volunteers have quit and the few financial supporters we had before have cut off all their donations. It's getting worse and worse. When I asked you to volunteer at the orphanage, I didn't realize how bad the situation would get. Maybe... you should stop coming for a while. Boss, we're offering very little compensation. I don't think Mr. Zhou is going to give in that fast. We already scared off all their workers and their financial supporters. Without people and money the place won't last much longer. For now it's best for us to keep a low profile. That way we can avoid the matter becoming known to the public. I don't give a damn about all that. If we wait too long, then my father is going to come take care of the matter himself. Then he will find out about me gambling the project money away in Macau. I'll give you one week to get me the title on that property. A- Long, if you want to kill your enemy, you have to stab him right in the heart. So think about what that old man cares about the most. Yes sir. Don't be afraid. Children, don't be afraid. It's okay. Everything is okay. Don't cry. Come here. I'm scared. It's okay. Be good, don't cry. I'm here, it's all going to be okay. I'm scared. It's okay. That's a good boy. Don't cry. Behave yourselves and don't go outside alone. Hey, why is this place such a disaster? You guys planning to move out or something? You did this, didn't you? We have already reported it to the police. The police? The problem with the police is that they require evidence. Did you see us do it? Get out! I'm here to give you notice about the orphanage. You have two days to move out. Go home and tell your boss that he will only get this land over my dead body. Is that all you got? My grandma can hit harder than that. Let me go! Let her go. Don't get involved. Just call the police. Yi, take Mr. Zhou inside. Let's get out of here. Thank you for what you did today. Unfortunately these guys won't give up that easily. It's okay. I'll stay in the orphanage from now on. Using violence to fight violence won't solve the problem. Even though you fight well and can scare them off for now, it won't solve the problem for good. But if he's here at least he can keep you safe. I'm just an old bag of bones, they wouldn't bother harming me. But the two of you have to watch out for yourselves. Come on! Not fast enough! Not accurate enough! Not fierce enough! A- Long That guy is super fast, extremely accurate, and terribly fierce. Are you telling me this guy is Bruce Lee? A- Long, I am not lying to you. He is probably better than Bruce Lee. I don't care if this guy is Bruce Lee or some legendary kung fu fighter, I want you to take care of him. Understood. Go round up some good hired hands to do the job. Got it. A- Long, you asked for me? This should be enough stuff to last the kids a while. Thanks for coming with me today. No problem. After all, it's my job to carry heavy things. You are a pretty funny guy. Don't mind what Mr. Zhou said today. It's okay. Only the unjust use of force is actually violence. Yeah, you're right. You know, I would have never guessed you are so tough. Now I've seen it all, the house mover superhero. I'm no superhero. Actually, I think at times you are braver than I am. Oh come on, those few moves of mine are harmless. I'm actually a small wimp who just don't realize her limits. Well then I'm a small wimp too. Fine then, we are both wimps. Get in the car, superhero. Close your eyes, I want to show you a magic trick. Now I finally know what actually happened that first time we met. Who were those guys? Professional hired hands. They take care of people's dirty business. Mr. Lee's company must have hired them. I think so. What are we going to do? Now they will come after you. Don't worry. There is no way to avoid a coming storm. It's late. You better get some rest. I was thinking... See you tomorrow. Sit still kid. Don't move. Stay still. Just get on with it. You guys are scums. You again, huh? Do you really think I'm scared ofyou? Get him. Who are you working for? A- Long. They are getting desperate and resorting to extremes. It looks like we won't be able to protect this place much longer. The important thing now is to find Lee's gang and get some evidence we can use. Nice hit. Lee, I told you for fighters you can't depend on luck, you have got to depend on strength. Those fighters of yours look good on the outside, but they are gutless on the inside. Luck will always change on you. Before you had A-Hai, no one could beat him. That guy made you a shitload of money, but you threw him out on his ass. I'll let you slide this one time, but don't you ever forget you owe me. Gentle breeze blows Through the green willows Whose branches are filled with swallows Quickly children, go into the other room. Ah, Mr. Zhou. I hear you have had a lot of volunteers getting injured lately. So I decided to pay you a special visit. Your kind are not welcome here. Mr. Zhou, I think there has been a great misunderstanding between us. I came to tell you if you sign the contract today, I'll forget about all the things that have already transpired between us. I'm not against signing the contract, but I have one condition. You have to compensate us with a piece of land as big as this one. All the related compensations have been written out in the contract. That contract of yours is bullshit, I won't see one penny ofcompensation. I won't sign. How would you like it if I take a torch to this place? Stop. Stop fighting. We wouldn't want to scare the children. Yes. So, what they say about you is true. Since you can fight, then let's resolve this matter with a fight. Let's play a little game. If you win, then I'll agree to meet Mr. Zhou's demands. No way! I won't allow you to use the orphanage as a wager in these ridiculous games you play. Why should we trust you? You don't have to. We will put it in writing. A- Long I don't care how much you pay, get me the best fighter on the street. Yes sir. Under no circumstances will I support you in using violence to solve the matter. Never mind. I'll take full responsibility for my own actions. Violence will never fix anything. I know you spent time in prison for fighting, and I hope you won't repeat the same mistake twice. It's all my fault for bringing you to the orphanage and getting you mixed up in this mess. It's not your fault. Do you mind if I ask why you spent time in prison? Murder. The truth is... I volunteered at the orphanage isn't because I like kids. My dad is the head of a big company and in one of his business deals he forced a competitor out of business. The owner of that company and his wife committed suicide together. Their son was sent to the orphanage by relatives. Even though it wasn't directly my father's fault, I still feel partly responsible. When I was a kid I saw a movie where a judge handled a case where he was unable to punish some clever criminals. So he went on a motorcycle at night and used his own methods to punish them. I thought it was really cool. After that, I started learning to fight. By the time I was a teenager, I was the toughest kid on the street. They gave me a nickname. The Street Fighter. The Street Fighter? Sounds pretty cool. When I was 16 I killed a guy in a fight. I got 8 years for it. My father lost it and cut off all ties with me. In prison, I just started reading a lot of books for some reason, and the books helped me understand a lot of things. The power of the fist can only temporarily force people to yield, but it will never bring permanent respect. That day I got out of prison I promised myself that I would never use my fists to solve problems. What about your mom? She died while giving birth to me. I'm sorry to hear that. Do you believe in reincarnation? No, not really. If there really were such a thing as reincarnation, what would you want to be in the next life? If I really could be reborn into the next life, I would want to be an eagle. An eagle? Have you ever heard the story of the eagle being reborn? Thank you. No problem. Good night. I have a little trouble come up recently and I need your help. You spared my life before, so I am at your command. I want him dead! Okay. But after I do this for you, then the slate is clear between us. He is a master fighter. To me, there is no such thing as a master fighter. You surprise me. You are much stronger than before. A- Hai Why? Shut up and fight. We have no way out of this. It's up to you. A- Hai, he is already exhausted. You know what to do. A- Hai Fight dammit! A- Hai Why aren't you fighting back? Who knows, maybe one day we'll end up like those fighters in the movies who have to fight to the death. I won't fight him. Let my friend go. Go on then. Let them go! Why put your life on the line for them? When you get mixed up with these gangs, there are always debts to be paid. Promise me one thing. Sure. Don't go after those guys for me. Stay away from them. Leave the city and hide out for a while. What are you going to do after this? I don't know. You shouldn't have saved me. I was your enemy tonight. A- Hai We were enemies for a night, but best friends for a lifetime. You are really going to leave? If I stay, there will only be more trouble. Is there nothing here that makes you want to stay? There is. But I want to get out and see the outside world. Feng, are you really leaving? Feng, are you not coming back to visit us? Feng A- Hai and him have been best friends since they were kids. Should we take care of A-Hai as well? A- Hai is already useless. Right now the biggest obstacle in our way is this damn Street Fighter. The fact is he has a tainted background. We can use that for our advantage. Does he have any family members? His father drives a taxi here in the city. Dad. Are you okay? You have been up to no good again, haven't you? Wait. I know it's not that easy for a person to change. But you are already grown up and have to take responsibility for your actions. There are some things that you just have to bear. Regardless of what you have done out there, you can't let matters get worse. Granny. Young man, so nice to see you again. I'm going to leave town for a little while. While I'm gone, please take good care of yourself. I will. But I have something to say to you. You are still young, and the road ahead of you is still long, so remember to live a good life. Granny Somebody call an ambulance! Granny Somebody help! Granny! Any relatives of the patient here? I am. She was very lucky this time. Only a few scrapes, but she should be more careful next time. Okay. Thank you. Hello Feng, Mr. Zhou is in trouble! What? Fight. Men get ready Come on, kill him! On the battlefield, there are only two kinds of people. Those that live. And those that die. To the winner all the glory. Get it over with. Are you really not afraid to die? Why force me? I was just in the wrong place at the wrong time. Everybody makes mistakes. The important thing is how you make up for them. You have too much unfinished business. Go back now. How is Mr. Zhou? He's doing fine. The police got him out of there. And you don't need to worry about the orphanage. The police have taken care of everything. Hi. I need to ask you a few questions about the case. "One month later" Dad, drive safely. Feng Tomorrow is my birthday. I want to spend the day with you. I got this for you.
