The Eternal Return The eternal return... This title, borrowed from Nietzsche, means here that even legends can be reborn unbeknown to their heroes. An eternal return of the very simple circumstances which comprise the most famous of all great love stories. -- Jean Cocteau. Achille! Achille! Claude! Have you seen Mr Achille? Here! Look what your Mr Achille has done. My God! Achille! Let me congratulate you. Well done. I warned you about collecting guns with Achille around. I never use them... These stupid guns would give anyone ideas. Achille killed Claude's dog. Shot it. With a gun of mine? He stole one of my guns? That's all you care about. You're driving me crazy. None of them are missing. He's killed Claude's dog. Marc will make a scene. And where could that child be? Achille is no child. - Achille is no child? - No. He's a dwarf. - Am?d?e. - A 24-year old dwarf. We have a 24-year old son who's a dwarf. And it exasperates him to be called a child, by the way. Is it my fault the poor child's a dwarf? - It's not mine. - Are you saying I'm a dwarf? - You're not tall. -That's rich! As if there was any connection. Not tall... Wasn't your great grandfather a hunchback? - Yes. I admit it. - Then think before you speak. Don't forget Achille is my son... and I adore him. - Gertrude. - What? Achille... - Achille what? - He often eavesdrops. My God, I hope the poor dear didn't hear anything. - Where have you been, darling? - Nowhere. - Answer your mother. - Leave the child alone, Am?d?e. Don't forget I'm no longer a child. Of course not, sweetheart. Come and give me a kiss. Are you sulking? - What's this? - That? It's a tie. Do you think I'm a cretin? Whose tie is this? Your mother's asking you whose tie it is. Is it one of Patrice's ties? You stole it from his room? Come here. Come here. Do as your mother says. What's in your pockets? Go on, show me. You will return this tie at once. At once! Do you want a smack? Do you? Did you see them, Moulouk? Weren't you scared? - He saw us. - So what? Is looking out the window a crime? So you see, Achille, there no point arguing. Now, go to your cousin as if to say hello and return this tie somehow. I hope you're big enough... Well...clever enough to understand that as guests we should behave impeccably. - Yes, Mummy. - Don't mock your mother. Yes, Daddy. - What do you want? - Just to say hello. - Say hello, Moulouk. - Your dog hates me. Then he'll bite you. Bite him, Moulouk! Bite him, Moulouk! Idiot. You idiot. Patrice... You know Moulouk won't bite. Get out of the wardrobe. - Hold him or I'll scream. - Scream, my friend! Bite him, Moulouk! Mummy! My poor darling. What's happened to you? The dog... Patrice made him bite me. Let Maurice carry it, Claude. It's too heavy for you. - Is everybody all right? - Well... I never like you being away, sir. - Is it Mr Achille? - Yes, sir. But you'll always be welcome, sir. That dog doesn't deserve any sugar. Why is that, Aunt? What an odd dinner. What's wrong? - Is it because I'm back? - That dog bit Archille. - Mummy... - Shut up. - Patrice provoked the dog. - He never bites, Uncle Marc. So I'm a liar? Achille... Let's not talk about dogs tonight, if you don't mind. - Why? - Because I'll lose my temper. - Keep an eye on Achille. - What is he accused of? You're wrong to insist, Gertrude, very wrong. Of course. I'm always wrong. Unlike my charming sisters. Edith and Solange are dead. Leave them in peace. No! Edith was always right because she was your wife. So was Solange because she was Patrice's mother. I'm wrong because I'm Achille's mother. - I wish I were dead. - Gertrude. Leave me alone! It's awful. The poor child suffers from being different. The poor child... Patrice, I must talk to you in my study. - Come, my sweet. - Leave me alone! Achille... I wish I were dead. - I don't like this. - Nor do I. Achille shot Claude's dog. How awful... Achille is a calamity. I wanted to be alone with you for a while. Uncle Marc, you look exhausted. Without your aunt and your mother's help... I can't cope with her scenes. As all we loved is dead, Gertrude should be happy. That's unfair. She's suffering too. She saw my despair. She saw me bring you up like a son. She sees you. Very little. I'm always out on the estate. I'd like to help you more. Uncle. - You shouldn't live alone. - I have you. I don't mean that. This place needs a woman. - Really? - They think I monopolise you. They'd turn green if you got married! - To whom? A local lady? - Why, a young woman. - She wouldn't want me. - You're much younger than me. Uncle Marc, let me find you a young woman. The youngest, the prettiest. You'll be so in love. - And they'll be so jealous. - Seek, Moulouk. Just try me. I'll seek and I shall find. - A nice family. - Coming, Moulouk? - Off to the island tomorrow? - To torment your serfs. I only want what I'm owed. - Good night, Uncle. - Good night, old fool. Bye, Jules. I'll let you know when to come and pick me up. - What's up? - Always the same character. Don't go in. He's dangerous when he's drunk. Leave me be. Look at this! Just leave me be! - Leave me be. - Stop it, Morolt. - Leave me be. - We must go. Leave me be. Drink. - Drink! - No, Morolt. Let's go. Leave me be. Go on, drink. Drink! Stop it, Morolt! Leave me be. - Cognac. - Cognac. Yes, sir. Drink that. - Drink it! - No. Don't stay. - Come. - Watch out! Don't pull out the knife. Take him to our place. Quick! He still looks ill, doesn't he? The fever has abated. With the herbs, he'll be fine in three days. He's handsome. His face isn't from these parts. Don't talk. Talking doesn't tire me. But turning my head does. You're lucky Anne's a healer and knows about herbs. - Who's Anne? - She raised me. My parents were Norwegians. They had a boat. They went sailing just after I was born. The doctor wouldn't let them take me. The boat capsized. - Your parents drowned? - Yes. Like mine. We're both children of the sea. What's this Morolt to you? He'll marry me. And he'll kill me. You're engaged to that drunkard? He thinks so. How old are you? My name's Nathalie. I'm 22. I'm 24. My name's Patrice. - Is that you, Anne? - No, it's Nathalie. - Feeling better? - Well... yes. But I still don't feel very strong. If you didn't walk Moulouk he'd be sicker than me. I'll miss him. You're throwing me out. You're not from the island. You've recovered. Anne has given you her room. You'll soon be back home... and this knife business will seem like a bad dream. You're not from the island either. Me... Wouldn't you like to leave this island? That Morolt? This bad dream? Wouldn't you like to escape all this? Secretly... Sail across the water... Marry a man who's worthy of you... And be alive... You're not alive here. You're dead. You'd have a castle, a car... servants, trees, roads, animals, money... love. You're very intimidating, you know. I had to pluck up courage to make this odd proposition. You're crying? No, I'm not crying. Listen, Nathalie. Listen to me. Will you listen to me? I have an uncle who looks younger than us. He's a delightful man. And I want... I mean... I'd like you to become his wife. Nathalie. Nathalie, what's wrong? Answer me, Nathalie. What are you doing here? I have a score to settle. - Is he up there? - Yes, he is. Go on up. - It annoys you, doesn't it? - Me? I couldn't care less. You'd like to protect him. You're too stupid, Morolt. Talk then, if you're so clever! I thought we had agreed to get married. So? You don't get married with handcuffs on. I want to smash his face in. Settle your scores later. Don't make a scene here. His uncle owns the whole island, understand? Then he must go. He's leaving tomorrow. Then we can get married. - Is that true? - It's true. - What if I killed him? - So? I hate him. You'll have plenty of time to get even. - Then kick him out. - Tomorrow. - Agreed? - Agreed. Go now. Still, I would have loved to smash his face in. Why did you run away? I thought you were making fun of me. I was stupid. - Well then? - Well what? You haven't given me an answer. Why would your uncle marry me? Because he'll love you when he sees you. Will you accept? - Yes, I will. - I knew I'd be in luck. I'll describe Uncle Marc and the family. - Later. We're leaving tonight. - We can't. A fisherman I know will take us. Wait at the headland. I'll meet you in an hour. - Has he gone? - Yes. I'm so sad to be leaving you, Anne. So you'll marry his uncle? I'm sick of poverty. I'd hate to marry Morolt. And...do you think you'll love this uncle? Who cares? I want to leave the island. You don't think it matters. I don't agree. - What are you doing? - Listen, darling. I want to ask you something. It says "poison" so that no-one touches it. - What is this? - I don't care if you laugh. It's a herbal potion. Those who drink it love each other forever. My poor Anne. I don't believe in herbs. Be happy and promise me. I don't believe in them but I promise. I find the label amusing. I'll look like I'm poisoning myself and my husband. Nathalie... There's... something else I want to confess. You'll find me so ridiculous. When you left the room and slammed the door, and I was left by myself... I thought... I mean... I was silly enough to think... that you thought I was proposing to you, myself... rather than on my uncle's behalf. You're five years old. Can you imagine me in that castle? I can see you there. Patrice... Take me back to the island. Hold on tight. Uncle Marc, Nathalie. - What are you doing? - I'm making ties for flies. That's insane. What is it this time? Will you answer me! It's Patrice with a lady. And Uncle Marc is holding her hands. - What are you talking about? -No one ever believes me. Gertrude. What is it? What's going on here? Views of the estate. You'll hear frogs. These stairs lead up to Uncle Marc's room. He occupies the whole right wing. -Do you like Uncle Marc? - He seems very kind. You're still to meet the burlesque troupe. Here's your bathroom. Your medicine chest. Snake bites, mosquite bites and other family bites. And of course, arnica for bicycle falls. All my childhood. I'll let you rest. We'll drive to town tomorrow to buy anything you need. Are you happy? Tell me, Patrice, is he a real dwarf? His mother thinks he's a very big dwarf. But he's unmistakably a dwarf. You'll get used to it, you'll see. - Are you sleepwalking? - Sorry, I was thinking. - What's going on? - Nothing. - Are we having guests? - No, just a friend of Patrice's. He's showing her around her room. Edith's room? I don't want it to remain a dead room. And this friend of Patrice's... is just a friend? A friend. I'll never be good at chess. Because you're not paying attention. Nathalie... Isn't youth beautiful? Look at them, Marc. This old castle is coming alive again. I love that. Nathalie, it's your turn. - I can't follow it anymore. - Giving up? I'll go back to my room. I'm so tired. - I'll walk you back. - No, Patrice. Stay here. Nathalie doesn't need anybody. Good night. Maybe we could... I think I'll follow the young lady's example. I will too. I'm so tired. Good night. Stay here. I must talk to you. I'm going to marry Nathalie. I'm going to marry Nathalie. What? I don't believe it. Doesn't the age difference bother you, my poor Marc? Nothing you say can change anything. I've made up my mind. - She played her hand well. - Gertrude... - This person is an old friend? - A childhood friend. I met her when she was Achille's size. Let's go, Am?d?e. - You don't regret anything? - What is there to regret? For me, it's incredible. Let me get used to it. - What about me? - To you... to this castle, this life which is all new to me. Alone at last. - What a comedy. - What a tragedy. Stop chewing your gloves. Take them off. Go and shut the window. All we have to do now is pack up and leave. - And go where? - How should I know? We no longer belong here. They'll make it clear soon enough. - I would fight. - That's a likely story. What you call fighting is being a parasite, putting up with being degraded and ruined. Achille, come here. Do you like your new aunt? Of course. Darling, we'll have to keep our eyes open. When I fight, I fight. Patrice loves the girl and marries her to his uncle. It's revolting. But let's smile, Am?d?e. Let's smile... Achille will keep an eye on the couple. - Are you listening, Achille? - Yes, Mummy. Try to catch them in the act. We'll enlighten poor Marc and that'll be that. Why involve Archille? Fight, my friend! Fight! But let me fight my way. - Wait here for me. - How long will you be? - About an hour. -Charming evening. I'm not leaving until the storm passes. - My poor child is all alone. - Nathalie's there. He must be terrified, like me. He won't leave his room. - I doubt it. - Meaning what? - The house is his to play in. - "Play" describes it nicely. There you are. The family picked their day to go to town. Put another log on. Do you know how to? Nathalie, you're not fond of me. - What are you saying? - You're not fond of me. - I'm fond of your uncle. - Of course. That's different. With me, you're always on the defensive. - Me? - Yes, you. Nathalie, you're sad. You're not happy. I have a sad nature. I'm happy. Then cheer up! Do silly things! - When do you do silly things? - Right now if you demand it. I demand it. Go on, I'm ready. How about drinking lots of alcohol? - So you see me tipsy? - No, merry. Drink alcohol if you must, but I won't have any. I'll concoct something magic for you. - Got you! - Let me go! You're hurting me! Stealing cognac! You came in through the vent. - You're drunk, you pig! - I wasn't drinking. Let go! Why should I waste my time? Get out of here! - Here's enough for much folly! - I'm filled with admiration. So you should be. - Were you bored without me? - Not at all. Thank you. - How very talented. - Very. - Not for me. - It's not strong. I hate alcohol. Didn't we say we'd do silly things? With me. Drink it all in one go. - To your happiness. - You're impossible. - Hooray! She's drunk it. - Don't treat me like a fool. What's the point of getting drunk? No point at all. That's the beauty of it. Can you see the ceiling dancing? - The fire's dancing. - It's the ceiling. It's the fire. It's the ceiling. - What's happening to me? - You've been drinking, like me. We should drink more often. It's marvellous. It's not marvellous, Patrice. And at the same time it is marvellous. Now you see I can do silly things. Patrice, I'm scared. - Are you scared of the storm? - No, not the storm. But I'm scared. Say nothing for a moment. The house was nearly struck by lightening then. As a child, I loved that picture of Franklin... chasing away lightning with a whip... as if chasing a dog. I'll chase it away too. I won't let it come near you. Nathalie... It's you... It's you. We're very lucky. What is it? Nothing... But we were lucky. My God, it's dark here! Anybody home? What a storm. I'm soaked. Take off your coat. You'll get sick. And I'll have to nurse you. Where's Achille? I don't know. - What are you doing there? - Me? I was drying myself. If I were you Marc, I'd keep an eye on Patrice. Is that you? You're scaring me. Are you sick? Yes, Patrice. I think I'm sick. What's wrong? You shouldn't have made me drink. Don't tell me a few drops of alcohol made you sick. It wasn't just alcohol. If it had been poison I'd be sick too. Patrice... I refuse to believe in such an absurd thing. - But it does scare me. - What does? Achille gave us a herbal potion which Anne had made. She was afraid I wouldn't marry for love. Do you really believe in these old wives' remedies? You don't, Patrice? Well, no. It takes more than that to be poisoned. I wonder... I don't know... I don't know any more... I wanted to know if only I was feeling this way. You can be reassured now. Yes, Patrice. I'm reassured. - Totally reassured. - Go back to your room now. What would Marc think if he found you here? Where have you been? - You scared me. - Why be scared? I couldn't sleep. I was walking in the corridors. You seem to be a bit edgy. And Patrice seems a bit edgy too. I'll probably have to send Patrice away. We can't let ugly rumours spread, Nathalie. We can't let people talk. Gertrude is frightening. Get some sleep. We'll forget all this. Things will sort themselves out. - I'm sure you're right, Marc. - Sleep, my angel. Good night, Marc. Having trouble sleeping? - I was smoking. - You never smoke. - Uncle... - Listen, Patrice. I won't allow people to attack you or suspect you. So don't try to justify or defend yourself. I don't believe those rumours. But people here are very mean. I won't let them sully Nathalie's name. - She's very young. - Yes, Uncle. You used to disappear for weeks on end. You went riding, camping, hunting... Go, as usual. Without saying any goodbyes. Yes, Uncle. We just can't allow nasty remours to spread. We can't - Is that you? - It's me. Quick, listen. Meet me at midnight by the spring. Are you listening? It's serious. - I'll be there. - Go back inside. It's very bright tonight. Don't come nearer, Nathalie. It was stupid of me to ask you to come. The Frossins are trying to discredit us. Marc wants to send me away. I beg you to plead my cause. Marc believes you. So you must make him see the truth. Yes, I know... You don't like me much. But as you've come... Help me. You must trust Marc. He'll see through calumny. And there's no need to meet me out here. What we have to talk about is no secret. Farewell. Uncle Marc... Did you see them? I'll never forgive you. - Where are they today? - Having a picnic. A picnic... It has been going on for two weeks, with Marc's blessing. - It's beyond words. - Your turn, Mummy. Well, they're careful in front of him. Marc must be told somehow. - I know a way. - What way? You look so cheerful. - She hates my driving. - A public menace. I'll be back in three days. I'll send you a telegram. Mrs Frossin is waving goodbye, sir. It's you... It's me, Nathalie. - You're mad, Patrice. - Yes, I'm mad. I'm mad and I believe you were right. We've been poisoned. But the poison's beautiful, Nathalie. Patrice... We've been poisoned. It's marvellous. There's nothing we can do. Patrice... Nothing we can do. You can't stay in this room. What if I did stay? Sometimes, one walks back after driving off. Sometimes, one doesn't have the upper hand. Leave us, Gertrude. Uncle... There's nothing to explain. Go back to your room. You'll hear my decision in the morning. First of all, there's no need for explanations or tears. Patrice, you're leaving the estate. I'm not turning you out, but I'll avoid you. I've arranged for you to leave today. - You... - Uncle, I must... I'd appreciate it if you didn't interrupt. You're going back to your island. To the house where Patrice found you. - Marc... - Gertrude will drive you. I couldn't have found a better escort. - You'll leave today. - Not to the island, Marc. There's a drunkard who wants to kill me. You can't... You handle men very well. I've made up my mind. You're going back there. Arguing would be painful and pointless. You're free, Patrice. Nathalie stays in her room till she goes. Farewell, Marc. This car is going to explode. What's wrong? - It's smoking. - I can see that. A breakdown. How pleasant! Right in the sun, too. - We'll have to wait. - This isn't a main road. Put your hanky on your head. I took a short cut... - Mummy! A car. - We're saved. Sir! Sir! - Mummy... It's Patrice. - What? - Problems? - What are you doing here? - Playing hero, Aunt. - Right. We'll swap cars. Wrong. Don't touch me! Achille! Why scream? I won't hurt you. And Achille knows he'd better keep quiet. - He's mad. - Sit down. How dare you! I represent your uncle. - But so badly. - He's completely mad. You're his accomplice. You'll be sorry. Achille, get out! Go after them! No, don't get out! Assassins! Louts! - How are you feeling today? - Fine, Patrice. You were asleep... without me. Like a little girl. Were you dreaming? Ever since we ran away, I've dreamt about the present. And when I wake up, I think I'm dreaming. But I don't know the people in your dreams. The people in my dreams know you. You're freezing. - Yes, I'm a bit cold. - I'll make a fire. Moulouk, remember to shut the door! A walking forest. - I'm causing you such trouble. - Lots and lots. Patrice... - What are we going to do? - Light a fire. What have I dragged you into? With that job in town, we'll find a place to hide. You must get better. Patrice... I'm so scared of becoming ill... and showing you a face that would frighten you. A face you wouldn't love anymore. You must feel much worse than you ever said. You're feverish. - It's my fault. - It's our fault. We were mad. Yes, my love. But it was beautiful. And I wouldn't want to live without it. Patrice... I'm so selfish. I'll go into town now. I'll be back tonight. Patrice! It's awful to leave you alone. I won't be alone. I'll look after Moulouk. Moulouk will look after you. Moulouk! Look after my sweetheart. Patrice! I won't be long. I was expecting you. I knew you'd been here. I knew you'd come back. I came last night with thoughts of murder. I watched you sleep... and I was disarmed. It would be better if you followed me. Take me away as fast as you can. Take anything you want. There's nothing for me to take, Marc. I came here with nothing. Will you miss this shack? Take me away! Quickly. As quickly as possible. Nathalie! Nathalie! Nathalie! - Petrol? - No. - Repairs? - No, I want to sell it. - Know of any antique lovers? - Talk to the boss. I'm sorry to bother you. Patrice! - You run a garage? - What's wrong with that? It's not how I pictured you. Well, lucky people own cars. Unlucky ones own garages. Have you seen my car? It's a venerable age. - You want to buy another one? - Just to sell it. I'm broke. - You? What about your uncle? - We're on bad terms. He's kicked me out. - Because of those... dwarves? - As well. Great! An abandoned child. Just our type. - Whose type? - My sister's and mine. We're abandoned too. Mum's joined Dad in Morocco. She made me take on this garage. Now they don't look after us. So we're like an old couple. And where do you live? - Nowhere yet? - Stay here. No, I'll find a room. And I'll sell the car. What about the Association for Abandoned Children? You're poor. I'm rich. I own a garage. I buy your car... And everybody's happy. - What is it? - Police. - You idiot. - That's what it's like here. Here's another abandoned child. Broke. Selling his car. He'll stay in Mum's room. Patrice. My sister Nathalie. I'll show you your room. Come on. Your room, sir. Period style. I don't know which period, but it's Mum's style. We have communicating rooms. If this style gives you nightmares, wake me up. - I'm most embarrassed. - You can't be that stupid. You'll get used to her ways. We'll let you settle in. Come, Nathalie. Mum's drawers are empty now she's dazzling Morocco. My name surprised you. - Don't you like it? - You can't be that stupid. He's learning! - Will you be able to sleep? - Yes, Marc. - Do you need anything? - No, Marc. Or rather...yes. I'd like to ask you a favour. I'd like to change rooms. Change rooms? Why? My eyes are nearly always closed. When I open them... I get so tired, Marc. I'd like to change rooms. Yes, Nathalie. I'll organise the room in the north wing. It's smaller, more cheerful. You can almost see the sea. We'll move you tomorrow. You're so kind, Marc. What's wrong with her? She misses her Patrice, that's what. The doctor thinks she's very ill. She'd fool any doctor. She pretends she's dying to soften Marc. And it's working. I have news of Patrice. - You? - I have, yes. Useless as I may be. - And what have you learnt? - He lives in town. With a mechanic... and his sister. A rather flighty sister whom he's never seen without. - So there. - How do you know? I occasionally go to town to buy firearms. So they've proven useful for once. - Tell me everything. - That's all I know. They form an inseparable threesome. It's even rumoured... that Patrice will marry the young lady. That's terrific! Surely they weld firearms in a garage. You're astonishing... You're so gloomy. What's wrong? Nothing at all. - I'll tell you what's wrong. - I can't wait. - You love Nathalie. - What? But you don't think she's in love with you. You're wrong. I know her well. - She's madly in love with you. - You're nice, but silly. Maybe so, but she loves you. It's obvious. - Then I should leave at once. - Why? If it were true, I couldn't stay in her house. You're so old-fashioned. - What would your parents say? - Dad wouldn't care. And Mum called from the train "Get married soon, Nathalie." Not your average parents. A customer. Get rid of him. I must sort all this out with you. - What a surprise! - Hello. Do you weld firearms in this garage? Nothing could be easier. Are you a mechanic? - No, a friend of mine is. - I see. Congratulations, then. The big news was true. - The big news? - You're getting married? - Me? Who told you that? - Nathalie. She was so happy. She couldn't wait to tell Gertrude. And how is Nathalie? She was unwell, but now she's as fit as a fiddle. She's nearly glowing. She's putting on weight. She does a magnificent job looking after the estate. She said I was getting married? She said: "At last he's getting married." "Marc and I are much relieved." So...I congratulate you. - What is it? - A firearm to weld. This is a garage. We don't waste time welding firearms. Okay. Don't get upset. I'm going. - You're not very polite. - That's the way I am. Goodbye. Goodbye, Patrice. - You know him? - A bit. What a bore. Listen, Patrice. - When will you understand? - Understand what? I know her best. And I know you. You love her, but you're afraid she'll laugh. So you pretend not to notice her. - You like her? - I like her, Lionel. I even like her too much. Love is something else. You're so complicated. To like her is to love her. Marry her and run the garage with me! Perfect. You have no family. We are your family. You can't wait for your uncle to choose you a wife. What do you say? Things will follow their natural course. You like her, that's the main thing. - You do like her? - Yes. Come in. - You? - What do you mean? You've been here two weeks. You should be used to me. I bet you find it odd to see me in your room at night. So you do think I'm that stupid? A little bit stupid. But I was bored by myself. I couldn't sleep. Do you sleep well? I sleep as much as I can. I find sleeping a waste of time. Don't you love life? Life doesn't love me. What a nice thing to say. I'm not talking about the present. Were you unhappy at your uncle's? Please don't ever talk about that. All right. I'll let you sleep. Give me a cigarette. I always say the wrong thing. I'm getting used to it. You're improving. You forgot to knock. Come in. What's the matter? You want your cigarette back? Listen. Slap my face if I'm bothering you. Is it true that... you're in love with me? Yes. Do you want to marry me? Yes. Nathalie... When shall we do this foolish thing? Very soon. We wanted a holiday. Let's do it then. I know an island where we can stay with a nice old lady. Where is your island? Fishermen live there. Have you decided to stop me from working all night? No, but we've decided to get married. - You're grotesque. - Grotesque. We're going to a deserted island. - What do you think? - We'll repopulate it. That should be fun with just the two of you. Go and fight somewhere else! - Hasn't Patrice come down? - He left an hour ago. It's funny. When I see you I think of Nathalie. - Nathalie? - My Nathalie. The one who married Patrice's uncle. Yes, of course. I had forgotten her name was Nathalie. - Where's Patrice? - Your brother may know. Here's a jolly fisherman! With his music box. - Have you seen Patrice? - No. He'll join us later. I can't waste any time. Every wedding needs a feast, and every feast needs music. Here's the music. I'm off to catch a ton of fish. You beautiful girl. This is great. Coming, Nathalie? I'll meet you at the boat. Hurry up. This wedding must stun the world. Coffee's getting cold. Patrice often mentions his uncle and aunt. - Do you know them? - I don't know his uncle. But I know Nathalie. Mine... I'd love to meet her too. - Do you have a photo of her? - You want to see her? She's my aunt. Don't tell Patrice I showed it to you. - Why? - He'd scold me. Young ladies do get jealous of each other. Young ladies. It was taken in the sun so you can't see her well. But in the shade she was radiating light. She looked like a seabird. Miss! Give me back the photo! Give it back to me! - Where's Patrice? - He's not coming. - Did he say that? - No. Lionel! Patrice will never marry me. Patrice? But the wedding is tomorrow. - We'll never be married. - Why not? It's simple. Patrice doesn't love me. What are you talking about? Has he just talked to you? No, because I haven't seen him. I haven't seen him because... even when I see him and talk to him he's invisible. No, Lionel. I'm sure of it. Patrice lives in another world. Our happy-go-lucky attitude, our gaiety, it irritates him. He's even further away when he's with us. You're stark raving mad. He loves us. He loves you. That's why we're on this island. I'm not the one he's seeking here. It's not my name he's calling. He's seeking a ghost, Lionel. Do you want to see the real Nathalie? Here she is. She's his uncle's wife. I'm only the shadow of that shadow of that Natalie. It took me a long time to understand... - I'll break his neck. - There's nothing we can do. - I'll break his neck. - No, Lionel! Lionel! Yes, sir. Morolt is dead. And I'll tell you something. He was missed. Yes, sir. They were proud of having a fellow who scared them. And as you can see... I'm not too busy now. People used to come here to be scared by Morolt. When he fell into the water blind drunk... people watched him drown. No one tried to get him out. But the next day... they were all so sad. Explain. Why? You know everything. - I'll break your neck. - Calm down, Lionel. Why agree to marry my sister? Because...I liked living with you. I liked you, Lionel. I thought I'd get over it that way. What does this woman mean to you? Patrice... Do you mind? - What are we going to do? - I disgust you. I'd like to save Nathalie. I'd like to save you. I'd like...a miracle. Lionel, this is the last thing I'll ever ask of you. I'd like to see Nathalie just one last time. Yes, that one. To see her. To let you see her. Let's go to the castle and hide. If I can bear it... and if it's true she's forgotten me... If it's true and you see it is... I swear I'll be strong. I'll marry your sister. I'll live for her alone. - I'd do anything, you know. - Let's sail off at once. - You're a good man, Lionel. - Do you mind? It's not possible, Lionel. Not possible... No, it's not possible. I get the message. Come, Patrice. Come. - Does it hurt? - Never mind. Help me. - We must get away from here. - The bastards. Well? He's asleep. - I don't trust this short cut. - Don't worry. I know the way. We'll get out of here. Patrice... - We can't go on like this. - I'm all right. I want to make it back to the island. Put your arm around my neck. I'll make it to the island. Everything seems normal. But a shot was fired, I'm sure of it. Moulouk didn't even bark. Some guard dog he is. - Nothing! - You scared me. I didn't see anything. I went all around the castle. But Moulouk has disappeared. He broke his chain. Get Anne and my sister. Tell Anne he's badly wounded. Nathalie... You're sufferng a lot. Stay still. Don't speak. Nathalie... You were here? He's badly injured. It was an accident. - I'll explain. - I'm not asking you too. Nathalie... Please, go and help Anne. Hurry. Be patient. Anne is coming. She'll look after you. She'll make you well. I'm going back. His temperature's still high. It has gone into his blood. It's a nasty wound. Don't you start crying! I am not crying. Lionel. - Do you want anything? - I want to talk to you. - You musn't talk. - Yes, I must, Lionel. Listen. Come closer. I'm afraid I may not be able to talk later. My head feels huge and it's pounding... Talk, then. - Lionel, I'm very ill. - It will pass. No, Lionel. I know I'm very ill. Listen to me now. I want to see Nathalie again. - I must see Nathalie again. - Calm down. I don't want to calm down. I want to see Nathalie. You will. Now be calm. I'll be calm when I see her. Lionel, you're my brother. You must go and bring her back. You must tell her I'm very ill. - I must see her before I die. - You won't die. I'm dying now, Lionel. And I want to see her again. - I'll go if you don't. - You're mad. Yes. yes, I'm mad. I'm going mad. Listen to me, Lionel. I beg you. Be reasonable and I'll do anything you want. Thank you. Thank you, Lionel. You must leave at once. I can't die without seeing her. I can't. I don't want to. My uncle must be told at once. He couldn't possibly refuse. She'd walk to the ends of the earth. - When are you going? - At once. Take the boat. I'll hear the engine. I'll recognise it. If you replace the flag... with one of her scarves... Ask her to wear a white scarf. I'll see it from afar. Have you understood? - Repeat it. - If I bring her back... I'll put a white scarf on top of the mast. Look after him. He's resting. I must go and tell his uncle. - When will you be back? - By tomorrow morning. I must be off at once, or his uncle could blame me. Of course. Go. The sea... It's on the sea. Can you see anything there? Calm down, Patrice. I'm with you. Can you see anything? It's dark, Patrice. I can't see a thing. Can you hear anything? - Did you just hear something? - Hear what? An engine in the distance. Listen... - Don't get restless. - I can hear the motor. Your ears are deceiving you. If you want to hear it, lie still. Nathalie...Are you there? Nathalie? Yes, Patrice. I'm here. Can you see anything on the sea? Can you hear anything? No, Patrice. Not yet. You'll exhaust yourself. You're bathed in sweat. On the sea... On the sea... The boat. Nathalie. The boat. It's the boat. Nathalie. Is that the boat? Yes, this time it is. Can you see it? Answer me. Can you see it? Instead of the flag... can you see a white scarf? No. I see a red flag as usual. Why? Look...again. Look. Look. It's the usual flag. The red flag. Patrice, it's not true. I lied. It's the white scarf. I can't... hold on to life... any longer. Patrice! - You're exhausted. - Let me go alone. You won't have the strength. I won't? Lionel! It's awful. Patrice. I'm here, Patrice. No one can reach them now.
