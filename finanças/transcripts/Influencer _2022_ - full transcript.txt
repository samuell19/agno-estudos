Traveling is all about experiencing new things. Pushing your own self boundaries. My goal this year would be to definitely travel more. You're so limited if you don't get out to the world and experience it for yourself. There's that old saying, The world is a book and if you don't travel, you've only read one page. Why limit yourself? It's really made me realize how little I've actually seen. Thailand has such a rich history. I feel so at peace here. I loved soaking it all in and really experiencing Asia the way it was meant to be experienced, away from my comfort zone. It's breathtaking. The adventures that find you if you just surrender to what the universe throws at you. I am really seeing Thailand. Just downed my third rum and coke. I'll be here all night. If you truly surrender to a moment, you realize that's all you need. There's a certain freedom to not knowing exactly what's coming next. There's so many amazing people here living in the moment. Making new friends all around the world, they see things differently. It's such a huge difference compared to America. And I loved soaking it all in. Only a few more days left here and really taking it all in. Love you all. Hey guys, another day in paradise. Just recording, watching a beautiful sunset on the beach. Anyhow... So I told myself this feels like a bad idea, you know? And he did turn out to be as dumb as he was cute. But we went back to his place. Probably one of the biggest regrets of my life. Seems like every night's the biggest regret of your life. I wish I could trade places with you, I'm so jealous. I had two tickets. Told you you'd regret it. Wait a minute. Wait, what is that up? That hasn't even come out yet! Oh girl, you need to talk to Ryan about getting me on this Adelaine gravy train. I don't think I will be much longer. I've been really thinking about it. Wait, honey, that boy put you in that place for a week. And he was supposed to be here. You know what? I wish I was dating someone who cared about my career. I just think that it hasn't been... What? Oh no, it's just Madison. Oh yeah, I can go. Oh yeah, okay. I gotta go, talk to Ryan for me, and smile more. I'd be happy to lend a hand. Sorry? The photo, I could take it for you. Oh, I think I got it. Thought I should offer. So where are you from? California, originally. Ah, a California gal, eh? I suppose I should have guessed, really. British myself. So what brings you to Thailand? The wonderful women. No, no, only joking. Really, I just came here to escape the British rain. Came for a visit and never left. Could never think of a good reason why I should go back to that miserable country and the miserable women. But look, if you are here all on your own, why don't I show you a round a bit? Come on man, get a hint. Just trying to be cordial. We're all friends here, eh? I'm going for a walk if you wanna come. Sure. Nice meeting you. You really gotta be careful around guys like that. Him? He was harmless. Yeah, at first. Get a few more drinks in them and then the real side comes out. "Hello, love. "Would you fancy a nightcap at my place?" Suddenly that drink you've been nursing starts to hit you a little differently and then before you know it... Trust me. What are you doing traveling by yourself anyways? It's a long story. Shorten it for me. Come on. You're in one of the most beautiful places in the world. What could possibly be wrong with that? Well, my boyfriend and I planned this trip together and the last minute he bailed. Bummer. All I ever hear is about how magical this place is. How you meet people from all over. All I've really done is sit by the pool. What are your plans tomorrow? I don't know. Come on, the sun's starting to come up! Wow. You guys won't believe how beautiful it is up here. If you aren't on an early morning hike, you are missing out. Since when are you suddenly shy? I just don't like being on camera. Okay. How does it look? So you really don't have a place to go back to. I mean I have family here and there, but no, not really. It must be so freeing. It has its ups and downs. It's better hot. Yeah, I can't wait. You've never taken a picture of your food? I usually prefer to eat it. Oh my god. It's the closest thing you can get to a home cooked meal around here. This is the kind of place Ryan would find. So why isn't he here with you now? I don't know, he was cute. Ugh, I am too drunk. You all good? Yeah. Thanks. I wish I met you sooner. Hello? The report's all filed now and I'll keep a lookout, but you know tourist police. There's not a whole lot they can do. I don't understand any of this. It's the usual. First name, last name, mother's maiden name. We'll expedite it, it takes like two weeks at the most. Two weeks? You are gonna have to travel up to Bangkok to pick up your new passport from the embassy. Is it awful for me to say that I hate the idea of being stuck here two more weeks? You don't have to be here. You can come crash with me. I'll show you around. No, I couldn't put you out. Hey, it's gonna be fine. First name right here. Hey, I'm just getting a few things sorted here. How's it going? Yeah, good. Just been so busy, feel like I'm drowning. Nice. Your flight gets in at 7:00, right? So listen, just... 'Cause I've got a shoot earlier in the morning, so I might need you to take your car. Is that all right? Ryan. What? I'm not gonna make my flight. What do you mean? Someone broke into my room. I'm not following. My passport was stolen. It's fine, I'm getting a temporary one. It just could take a couple weeks. You have a shoot on Monday. I'm not doing this on purpose. This is so... What? So you. You know, you're the one who wanted me to be here. For a week and then you decided you wanted to stay for two and now how long is this gonna be? Why don't you just talk me through what's happened so far? Have you been to the embassy? I didn't call to have you... I'm just trying to understand how you've let this happen. I didn't let this happen. I don't understand why you're getting upset. I'm trying to help. You know, I've been thinking about how to say this for the last few weeks. I think we need to break up. Why don't you call me again in the morning when you've calmed down? Mads... Change of plans. Looks like I'll be staying here for a while longer. I know some of you wanted to see the next phase of the adventure in Europe, but that will have to wait. I made a new friend. We're going to explore the country. Hey. This place is legit. Why would you ever leave? You don't meet people holed up in the jungle. Just make yourself at home. So I was looking a few things up and I have some ideas for what we should do tomorrow. I actually have a surprise for tomorrow. Surprise? You'll see. You have your own boat? It's not a big deal. Look at what we have this morning. Hey! Just wait 'till we get there. How much longer? How did you find this place? I spent a lot of time in the ocean. My dad had a sailboat when I was growing up, So I learned how to navigate when I was young. Just always wanted a place to get away to and leave my dirt behind, refresh. You finally got a break. I just realized I haven't been in front of a fire in like a decade. It was in girl scouts. We used to sit around telling scary stories. There was this one girl, forget her name. She used to tell the darkest shit. She'd probably think you brought me all this way to kill me out here. Middle of the ocean. No one can hear you scream. No, I'm not gonna kill you. Well, that is disappointing, But I am going to leave you here. First you'll wake up alone. You'll realize I'm gone. You'll check your phone but it's useless out here, so that won't help. No shipping lines out here. And the closest land is miles away. You'll start to look for food. Good luck with that. It's funny, you're surrounded by all this water. You can't drink any of it, so you'll start to get really thirsty. You think it'd be painful, but after a while you just start seeing things. I've actually heard it's almost euphoric. I had to guess, I'd say you'll last maybe three, four days at the most. You'll slowly fade into obscurity and like all the other girls, no one's gonna come looking for you. You'll cease to exist, gradually rotting away as the sand crabs eat your flesh. I like that. But you know there is one fatal flaw to your diabolical plan. People would notice I'm gone. You sell products to little girls. Do you really think they'd come looking for you? I bet if I took over your account, no one would notice. Honestly, that would be a relief. But I'm pretty sure they'd notice. Besides, I thought you hated social media. Does it make you happy? Doesn't make me feel alone. But nobody actually cares. You feel entitled to thinking that people should follow you, which makes you believe that you're the center of the universe. The star of the story, but no one is. Oh, we are 100% in my story. Everything is so much better now that I've decided to stay. Thailand really speaks to me. It's such a rich, vibrant country. Sometimes you just don't know what a new place has to offer. You know, every day feels so different. I like to get up around 5:30 AM. I'm able to get so much done right off the top of the day. I've always been a morning person. Early bird gets the worm. For breakfast, I tend to just make something quick at home, a quick start to the day. I like to get a good head start on work right away; emails, sponsors. I'll usually spend about an hour doing this. I always try to respond to my fans. If you let it, life can be one surprise after another. You just have to let go of your expectations. I think the most important thing is to find the part of your day where you can be really present. Often there's so many distractions, so many things you can do. But every day you get a choice. Putting yourself into situations that make you uncomfortable is the best way to become a better person. Another thing I stand by is I believe a healthy work life balance is the key to living well. Everyone needs time for themselves. Being authentic is the most important thing you can do to make a better world. Getting out of the grind of Western life has really opened up my eyes to what living can be. It feels like for the first time in a long while, I'm finally happy just being me. Hey guys, I'm at the Big Buddha. It's incredible. I came to pay respects. Hey guys, I'm at the Big Buddha. It's incredible. I came to pay my respects. So far, it's been practically perfect. Thanks again for all the support. I was wondering if I could talk to someone about increasing my credit limit. Yeah, of course. Hold for one second. I've decided to take a break from social media. We all need a break sometimes. Not sure when I'll be back, but wanted to thank you all for being there for me. I love you all. It's a fake. What? It's a fake. I know a place down the road that has real jade and it'll be a better price. No, I know, it's not for me. It's just some bullshit for my sister. She won't know the difference. Thanks. Are you following me? I'm kidding. I saw you at the store yesterday and now you're at my hotel. Right, from the shop. It's alright. Yesterday I realized why I totally know who you are. It's because I follow you and I'm such a huge fan and I felt like an idiot because of course you know how to deal with these places and those things. That's probably something that you do all the time. And the last thing I wanted to do was offend you. I don't know why I thought you needed help. And now I'm here at the bar and I come up to you and I say this stupid joke, and... Sorry. Have a good evening. You follow me? My boyfriend was supposed to be here with me. We had this whole trip planned, but he bailed the last minute and so we couldn't cancel and he convinced me to go alone. Well, what I always say to my team of girls is, in order to grow you have to be able to thrive on your own. You're right. I just, I think it's so cool how you travel all the time. I could never do that. Of course you could. I mean it took me a little bit, but anyone can do it. Just, it's really hard to meet people here. We have this huge villa booked overlooking the ocean down on the islands. Just, it felt weird being there alone, so I came here to be around more people. Look where that got me. How big is this place? Way too big for just one person, that's for sure. Okay, let me see. What do you think? What? Hat no hat? Definitely hat. Definitely hat. Definitely hat, she says. Okay, let me take a look. Let me take a look. That's great, oh, that's great. These are cute. Yes, yes. Let's do a few more. Oh, I love this one. You were so right, the hat totally works. These are so great. You're such a natural. Oh my God, stop it. You're too sweet. Oh, shit. Shit. What? I completely forgot. I'm gonna have to bail for a bit. The sponsor has been hounding me to go for dinner over the past couple days and I promised I would check out some of their products before we went out. Oh. Well, I would totally bring you if I could, but you know how these ones are. Oh no, no, it's totally fine. I completely understand. I'm so sorry. But listen, there's this place that I've been dying to show you. So let me meet up with these guys and I'll call you when I'm done, okay? Yeah, of course. Put on something nice. Jessica! Whose bike? Nice place. What's all this? Maybe your boyfriend showed up after all. You made it. Hi. Who are you? Who are you? I'm Madison's boyfriend. Ryan. I thought you said it was just you here. It was. I told my friend she could stay here while I was gone. She told me she broke up with you. Yeah, that sounds like Madison. I'm gonna go find my room. She didn't tell me we would have any visitors. Hope you see a surprise. You know, Madison never mentioned to me that someone was staying here. This place is under her name. She insisted on it. I just would've thought she'd mention it. I mean, I'm essentially paying for this place. Is everything good? Yeah. Well, this obviously isn't how I saw my night panning out. You guys seem lovely. Enjoy the food I guess. And let me know if you get hold of Madison. Guess I'll take Madison's room. Hungry? Oh, look who it is, huh? Yo, Madison, finally. You're at my place. Yeah, I am. Where are you? I changed plans. You need to leave. You don't sound so good. You're making this more difficult than it needs to be. I told you we broke up. Come on. You don't really mean that. How did you find out where I live? I can make it up to you. Mads. You need to leave, it's over. I'm not doing this over the phone. If you've got something to say, you can say it to my face. Okay? She'll be back soon. I'm ready to go. Coming? Do you think we could push a little later? I've just got this... I'll go. Yeah, I spent a summer on the island so I know some cool spots. Great. Let's go. You know this can wait. - All right. - Okay. Wow. Tilt the camera a little this way. Just think the sun's gonna hit me better here. Nice. So what's her deal? How long have you two known each other? A few days ago. How much longer for the food? Anyone who knows Madison knows that she wouldn't invite some stranger to come and live with her. Said it was her place. Nothing makes sense, you know? Madison's room got broken into and all of her shit got taken. Her passport, everything. It's just weird, you know? One minute she can't wait to come home and the next... Food's here! I'm starting to see why Madison wanted to stay. What happened between you two? Honestly... We should probably get a move on before we lose sunlight. It'll be a lot harder to climb down. Yeah, we should make sure our rooms weren't broken into. You'd be surprised how often that happens here. You guys coming? Hi. You're leaving. You're back. I guess neither of us could stand partying with Ryan, huh? I found a hotel. This late at night? I just didn't wanna put you out anymore. But thanks for everything. - I can drop you off. - No, no. I have a taxi. I saw that on my way in. I paid him for you. I just thought he didn't get his money. I told him to wait for me. You know what? It's okay. I'll call another one, it's fine, really. Did I do something? Look, I don't wanna get into it. Into what? I just think I would feel better in my own space. You're safe here. I'm here, Ryan's here. Okay, Ryan said that Madison's hotel room was broken into right before she went traveling with you. Weren't you with her that night? What are you trying to say? I mean, that Ryan's right. I invited you into my home. Okay, you told me that you booked this place with your boyfriend. You never said anything about Madison. But now Ryan is saying that this isn't even your place. It's under Madison's name. I think I know what you're up to. And what's that? You're taking advantage of her and you're not gonna do that to me. Madison is my friend. Look, it's money that you want, just take some. It doesn't matter to me. You don't have to pretend anymore. I don't even think the two of you are friends. With us, you just kind of stuck around. I've been weirded out since the night we met, but I, I don't know, maybe I should have just known. You're fucking creepy. You don't know anything about me. I don't want your fucking money. You entitled bitch. I really wish we could have finished what we started. Then you really would have seen the truth. They won't even notice you're gone. Please... Nobody cares. They never do. Hi, can I... Yo, come check out the pool, come check it out. Guys, guys, guys, guys. Hey, there she is, yo! This is the chick I was telling you about. She's so weird. I was so concerned about you. Looked everywhere for you. You just left? Jessica still here? She told me she was checking into another hotel. She was too drunk. Heh, sounds was about right. They need to leave. Chill, just come and have a drink with us. It's pretty fucking late, Ryan. And? Madison doesn't want you here and you can't keep treating this like your own goddamn place. You really like digging in other people's, shit don't you? I know everything. How many relationships you in. What? Like real relationships. That's not what I'm talking about. You know you're living in Madison's place too? I pay her. Get these people outta here. You're really walking on thin ice, Ryan. I guess mom doesn't wanna hang out. Happy? Wanted to apologize for last night. Did Jessica leave already? Yeah, she had to rush back home. Had some job. She didn't message you? I haven't checked my phone. This looks good. Thank you. You can stay until Madison gets back. I won't say anything. Look at this, the whole account's gone downhill. Look, I took this one. Cute. She needs me. I brought out who she really was. Now she's just so fake. Well, maybe this is who she really is. This ain't her. Ever since she lost her passport. Well, it freed her to do whatever she wants. And that's freedom? Dude, you gotta stop being such a little bitch. You're in one of the most beautiful places on the planet. I'd love if the guy came halfway across the world to look for me. If she doesn't see that, then maybe she's not worth it. I got her a rep, who then got her branding deals. The first girl. She blows up after this one video I got with this kid called Oliver Left. Have you heard of him? It got like a million views overnight. So she kind of reminds me of Jessica. Honestly, Jessica's got a bit of the spark. You know it when you see it. Some people just hold gravity. Madison's the same. Gravity. You know what I mean. You know, you'd do pretty well. I'm serious, you would. You're unique. People are all about that these days. I could help you. What? Wake up. Morning. Quite the night. We should probably get going soon. Don't have a ton of time. We've got like an hour left before your ferry leaves. It sucks you have to go. Yeah. Get home safe. You too. Ryan? Hey, Madison, right? Someone else was pretending to be you the whole time. Yes. I'm sorry. It was my friend Theon. I was passed out. I mean, we went out so late. I guess he thought it'd be funny to message girls on my account. Well good, 'cause I thought you were complete idiot. Yeah, you still came out. Maybe there's some charm to someone who's kind of stupid. Harmless, right? Yeah. Maybe I can trust that more than someone who's got something to hide. Is there any game you're not good at? Rematch? Smile. And the bear. That's actually really nice. Why do you sound surprised? I'll text it to you. So you don't really post that much, do you? Um, thank you? No, I just mean, you know, if you took that photo, used a couple of proper hashtags, I think you could tap into a pretty huge following. That photo. I think people would find you refreshing. I do. I don't know, sounds like work. Could be a lot of money. I'm serious. You know what? I could help. Is this just some ploy to see me again? Yes. You got me. Let me see that photo again. My girlfriend is staying here. Have you seen her? No. Are you sure? Good lord young man, who broke your heart? Another drink for this poor soul. So, why not tell Uncle Rupert all about her? Believe me, you don't get divorced three times and not get to notice a, a certain look. You haven't seen this girl, have you? I might have. I mean after a while they all start looking a bit the same. There's no shortage of women around here. Sorry. Her room was broken into a few weeks ago. I just can't see why she would come back. No, I do remember. Yeah, she made quite a fuss apparently. Left the next day. Haven't seen them since. Them? Yes, she was with a girl with a birth mark. Apparently she was here a few days ago. No. This was posted yesterday. No way, look, not a cloud in the sky. We're in the rainy season now. First sunny day we've had for weeks. Who's the fellow? Ryan? What time is it? When did you last speak to Madison? Maybe a week ago. Video chat, did you video chat? Wait, where are you? No, you didn't. Ryan, we have not video chatted in a while. Just text what's going on. I've spoken to Madison but I haven't seen her. It kind of seems like no one has. Is this about her post? I mean, do you really believe that "new love of my life" bullshit? She didn't even tell me she met a guy. She never mentioned him. She definitely would've told me about a cute guy she had met. I have to go. Ryan, you can do a whole lot better than Madison. Hey guys, I'm here at the Big Buddha. It's incredible. I came to pay my respects. Hey guys, I'm here at the Big Buddha. It's incredible. I came to pay my respects. Hey guys, I'm here at the Big Buddha. It's incredible. I came to pay my respects. Hey guys, I'm here at the Big Buddha. It's incredible. I came to pay my re... You know I've blacked out a couple of times. I drink, so it happens. But I never forget a shag. What is going on? Oh my god. Where is she? I don't understand. You can drop the act. "CW brought me to this wonderful island. "There's no phone service here. "Normally I'd hate this, but it feels so freeing. "I almost don't want to go back." You know, at first I thought you were doing this just to take advantage of her. You want to use her house? It's a nice house. Use her stuff. But that's not what this is about, is it? And honestly, I'm appalled. I would've thought someone like you would do a much better job of frankly basic security questions. - You don't know shit. - I do. I've seen it. I mean, fair play, you've got money. You're so much worse since she made you out to be. Are you lonely? Is that it? I wondered how you got into the house. Thought it was pretty fucking creepy. Do you track all of her purchases or just the big ones? Are you really doing this because you don't have any friends of your own? You have to use my girlfriend's account so that you can feel what, liked? How long have you been keeping tabs on her? That's some next level psycho shit, Ryan. Where is she? I'll call the police right now. And tell them what? That you beat a woman and tied her up on a whim? That she what, took your girlfriend? Do you not get it? I've got everything. Madison showed me the messages. She said that you hit her several times. You sent those. Who do you think they're gonna believe? I think you've got yourself in a little corner here. Tying up a woman. I think this is gonna bruise. What did you do with my girlfriend? I didn't do anything, but I can take you to her. Where are we going? Oi! It's just up here. What... Hi, guys. I just want to say that I always knew Ryan was a predator. I never trusted him. You bitch.
