Good evening dear friends and viewers from Albania and abroad. This evening in "Missing People", we travel to Greece to search for a young woman. She hasn't been in contact with her family for the past 5 years. Her name is Pranvera Limani. But who is she, and what has happened to her? Today, in our studio we have her mother. Let's go back in time. When was the last time you spoke to Pranvera? We spoke on the phone in September. I advised her as a mother. After that, she never called again. She was pregnant and alone. I'm a grandma and I don't know if it's a girl or a boy. If I had known she would take it so hard, I wouldn't have been so harsh. You two were close? Yes, very close. Like mother and daughter. I just wanted to protect her. You must miss her a lot. Tonight, we have good news for you. We've found Pranvera. Oh, thank you! Vera! My precious girl! What happened to you? You know I love you so much. Dear friends, you are watching "Missing People." Ilir is alive. He's alive. - Come now, come. Mother and daughter have finally been reunited after 5 years. Did you pack the stuff for tomorrow? I'll do it now. Take two bottles of raki. - Yes. They've forgotten what real raki tastes like in Tirana. How do you know? You haven't been there for 15 years. Please don't cry. We're going to the wedding tomorrow. I don't want to see you cry there. How do I look in his suit? Ilir wouldn't mind. We're brothers. Take it off. They're brothers. Take it off. He doesn't believe Ilir is alive. He does. He's the only one who doesn't. - He believes. Maylinda. Are you crying? No. Maylinda, you're crying. - No. My mother's been crying over Ilir for 3 years now. My father doesn't say a word, and you don't either. This is no longer a home, it's a graveyard. Maylinda, I've asked my uncle to get me the visas. I don't want to leave in a rubber boat and drown like Ilir did. But they never found his body. You still believe he's alive? You believe that he managed to swim to the Italian shore? I asked... I asked Uncle Lek to get you a visa, too. In Italy, things will be better for us. What's he doing? - I'll go check. We'll be late for the wedding. Newsbreak: There was an explosion yesterday in Kosovo. As a result, 2 Italian KFOR soldiers were killed. It is not yet known who is responsible for this act of terrorism. Officials have proclaimed a state of emergency. The Russian DUMA adopted changes in the law regarding the presidential mandate... Boss, are we gonna be late? We have a wedding in Tirana to get to. Boss, did you hear me? Are we gonna be late? If you stop bothering me, we won't be late. And now, more folk music. Are you alright? Want to step out for a bit? Maylinda, sit next to me. Are you feeling sick? A bit. Go sit next to Nick. May I smoke, too? You know it's not allowed. We'll arrive on schedule with a half an hour delay. Can you stop here, boss? It's forbidden in the center. But it's closer for us here. You can catch a cab at the bus stop. Vevo. Maylinda. Nick. Thank you. Thanks. Thank you. Should we take a taxi? I know Tirana like the back of my hand. So much has changed here. I don't hear any music! There'll be music at the restaurant. - Come on. Come, get in. I forgot you've never used one. It stinks like a dog. No, it doesn't. I am not getting inside that elevator. Which floor is it on? - The 12th. What? - The 12th floor. I knew it. - What did you know? You never listen to me. - These things happen. Help! - Don't make a scene. Is anybody in there? Yes, we are Lek's family. Lek from the 12th floor? - Yes! Be patient until the power goes back on. OK, thanks. I told you they'd fix it. - We're stuck here. It's horrible. We came for a wedding, and we get stuck. You never listen to me. Uncle, is that you? - Yes, we're all here. The power will be back on in 5 minutes. Two hours at the most. But we'll get you out. Two hours! - They'll fix it. But we could be stuck here for 2 hours. Come Vevo, come. Welcome. I wish your son much happiness. Thank you. Come, uncle. - Welcome. - How are you? Let's go upstairs. Two more floors. I sent a driver to the bus station for you. We got off in the center. Rok knows Tirana like the back of his hand. The driver will come now to take you to the hotel. What hotel? I booked rooms for you. Why spend money? We can stay at your place. There's not enough room. All the guests will stay at the hotel. A new custom in Tirana. Welcome, Vevo. I'm glad to see you. Thank you. Congratulations. Thank you. You've changed so much. Welcome, Uncle. Sit down. Make yourselves comfortable. Just relax. You must be Maylinda? Nick, how are you? Where is the groom? You'll see him at the wedding. Welcome once again. Sit down and relax. Uncle, finally we're reunited for a happy occasion. I haven't been to the village lately because I've been so busy. Yes, I know... Vevo, don't worry about the TV show. The head of the TV station will be at the wedding. Yesterday, they found a girl who'd been missing for 5 years. They thought she was dead. You mustn't ever lose hope. No, no, my boy. I've brought you some special raki. Maylinda, pass me the bottles. Who knows where my Ilir is now? And he can't even call us. We don't have phones in our village. When he comes home, we'll have a memorable wedding. Enough now. Don't you "enough" me. Maylinda deserves a big wedding. She's been waiting 3 years for Ilir to return. Give me the raki, Maylinda. I didn't mean to... I'm sorry, I didn't mean to. I'm very sorry. - Don't worry. Don't worry. No problem. Stop, stop, stop! Go back. One more time. Right there. Orchestra! Action! Thank you all for being here with us. Enjoy yourselves. Cheers. Cheers. - Cheers. Some guys have all the luck. Imagine welcoming a Minister's daughter into your family. He also likes to show off. He farts and money falls from the sky. What can you expect from a former peasant? What are you talking about? He's still a peasant. They're going to Paris for their honeymoon. Can you believe it? Paris! Peasants go there. They could've chosen somewhere more exotic. Paris is out of fashion. Cheers! Cheers! To us! Uncle, where's your drink? You've met my uncle? Cheers. Cheers, Uncle. - I don't have any raki. A raki for my uncle. Vevo. I spoke to Aida and the producer of the show, over there. Listen... You can pick up your visa at the Italian Embassy tomorrow at 9. I've settled everything. Do you speak Italian? - A little. What about Maylinda? - Not a word. As soon as you get there, give my friend a call. He'll help you. Here's a little something from Lek. Until you get settled. Thank you. Are you sure you wanna go? Yes. You're as stubborn as your brother. But think twice about leaving. You could go into business with us. Why leave Tirana? No, I've made up my mind. I want to leave. Are you in love with Maylinda? Find another girl. She's your brother's wife. She's nobody's wife. She's his fianc√©e. Stupid village custom. As long as my mother believes Ilir's alive, Maylinda must wait for him. She can't go back home. Her family disowned her. And what about her? What about her? Is she in love with you? Dear guests, our bride will now sing you an aria. The most beautiful aria from your repertoire. Let everybody admire your talent. An opera singer for wife. She'll only be pursuing her career. And who will raise the kids? The groom, of course. Good evening, Miss Aida. I am so happy to meet you. And who are you? I'm from Lek's family. How can I help you? - I have a case for you. My son disappeared 3 years ago. Where? - He left for Italy. In a rubber boat just before his wedding. Can you help me find him? Have you called my show before? No, we don't have phones in our village. Ilir is his name. His future bride has been waiting for him for 3 years. He left to get money for his wedding. We are poor. You are my only hope. Any news of him? No, but I believe he's alive. I must find him. All right. Come to my show. We'll do everything we can to find him. Thank you so much! We'll look for him together. Thank you! Thank you so much! Bravo! A true diva, already! Bravo! Bravo! And now, some real music. Move, move! Get out of the shot! Peasants! What a bunch of idiots! They dance to Serbian music! Why not? It's only music. You have a problem with that? We take all the worst from those shitty Serbs. Have you heard? They killed KFOR soldiers in Kosovo. They never said who killed them. You can expect only the worst from Serbs. They want to wipe us all out. What do you think? Who killed them if not the Serbs? The Serbs aren't the problem, it's people like you. You're a dumb fool. Wait... Take your hands off me! Take it easy. Fucking peasants! Nick, Mother said not to cause any trouble. We leave tomorrow. I'll wait for you in the park. I don't know. At 6 AM. I love you. I've loved you from the moment Ilir brought you to the house. Maylinda... Please! I can't wait any longer. Maylinda... Nick! Where is Nick? Rok, where is Nick? You knew about this? And you said nothing to me? How could you? I didn't know. But I suspected it. Come on. Let's go look for them. No, no... I am not going anywhere. You're not? I was 17 when I married you and they took you to prison. Everybody told me to leave you. They all laughed at me. My family turned against me because you tried to flee the country. I waited for you for 10 years. Because I believed in you. And for what? So that our sons would be like you? You've destroyed our family. And now you just sit here. You can't do that to me, Rok. You have no right. Come on, get up. Get up, Rok. Enough, Vevo. Stop it. Did you see all those people at the wedding? It made me sick to look at them. All these rich people today are the same ones that put me in prison. The only difference is... I am no longer afraid. But deep inside of me... I feel like I'm still in prison. Let them go. Let them be free, Vevo. There's nothing left in my life, Rok. I can't. I've nothing in the world left. You've destroyed us. We no longer have a family. They'll be happy. Believe me. Love, tell that idiot of yours to shut the window when he's practicing. His violin is driving me crazy. Can he rest at least for one day? First of all, he plays the cello. It's different from a violin, which is different from a viola. And a viola is different from a cello. Secondly, "the idiot" will soon be leaving and you'll still be in this slum. Even if you wanted to leave, that trash can of yours wouldn't take you 5 km out of Belgrade! Please don't follow me anymore. Milka, here you are. Let me know if you need anything else. Dear God! Here I am. Are you hungry? No. You're all right? Yes. I'll make some sandwiches. - Yes, some sandwiches. My granny always said, "Never go on a trip without a good chicken sandwich." Did your granny suggest a visa, too? What visa? And a letter of invitation? - No. Why? You mean... Oh, no! It can't be! Goodbye. That's my uncle! Hi, Uncle! - Hi, baby. This is Tanya's father. - Nice to meet you. Tanya's getting ready. And you? Us? - When's your wedding? We'll see. I'm going to see Tanya. Watch out for my niece. Here, want some? You're here! - Yes, I am! Hello, Aunt! Here's Marko. Congratulations. - Thanks. You know everything about Marko. More than I should. Lucky you. In Belgrade you just need two witnesses, and that's it. Here we have to honor tradition. I have nothing against tradition. We just chose that other solution, with two witnesses. We brought you a little something. Here you are. "A golden fish grants every wish." At least it worked for us. Tanya's great. - Yes. This is our house. This one? It's the same as the other one. But my folks only sleep here. They live in the old house. Why is that? My grandfather worked in Sweden and he built two identical houses. But when he died, my dad and his brother quarreled. Why? - Because of politics. My uncle joined the party that had won the elections and became a big shot. But my father is different. His party lost and ever since he's been depressed. Vera, come! Tell your dad that he's invited to the wedding tonight. You are all invited! Come on! Let's have fun! Dr. Radovan Karadzic: No one in this court knows the facts better than me. I was told that I could expect my rights to be protected... Mom! This is Marko. This is my mother, Vida. Nice to meet you. - Likewise. This is Milos. So, you're Marko. I am Marko. And you are Milos. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Dad, this is Marko. Dad, this is Marko. We came... If you're here for their wedding, you shouldn't have come at all. How was your trip? Tanya is my cousin. And her father is my worst enemy. Are you hungry? Do you have any family here? Vera and I came for the wedding. That's not the point. Where are you going to sleep? In a hotel. We don't have a hotel here. Come on, Dad, we'll see. We are going to spend the whole night at the wedding. You just had to come, didn't you? We have plenty of room here. The whole upper floor is empty. Here comes the brass band! One band's not enough! Two bands! I heard they booked three bands. They're doing it on purpose. They know I'm sick. They're trying to kill me with their music! Here it comes... I knew it! Water! - Quickly! Water! Go fetch the doctor. Did you hear me? Go with him, please. Here's the latest news. At 9 AM this morning in Kosovo a car bomb went off next to a group of Italian KFOR soldiers. Two were killed and two heavily wounded, others were transported to Prishtina hospital, where doctors are fighting to save their lives. KFOR Command has not issued a statement so far about this alleged terrorist act. Representatives of the Serbian community and Albanian authorities, however, both deny any involvement. What do you want to drink? - I want to find the doctor. Forget about the doctor. I promise you he'll come here. Beer or raki? Beer is fine. - Fine. Put two beers on my tab. - All right. You've got your own tab? - Of course. Open the beers for us. Those fucking Albanians from Kosovo again! They don't just kill us Serbs, now they kill Italian soldiers, too. They don't know who killed them. - Say that again? They said that they don't know yet. In Belgrade you know nothing. Here we know everything. How do you know? Of course we know. Do you watch TV there? I do. - So? Cheers. Mom, I have something to tell you. I know. You do? You got married. I did. I'm sorry. I didn't... Never mind. When is the doctor coming? Listen... Actually, my old man doesn't have health problems. You are his problem. Me? Sit down. Will you marry our Vera? But of course. No buts. Dad swore he won't let her marry until he gets enough money to organize a wedding twice as big as our uncle's. It's not your dad's or your uncle's wedding. Guys, how about a drink? OK. I won, so drinks are on me. Congratulations. - Bravo. No, thank you. Buddy... don't say no. No, thank you. How about a raki? No. Boss! - Yes? Raki for everyone! Not for us. Thank you. Alright. What did I tell you? Hi, Milos. - Good afternoon. Good day to you all. I'm afraid he's really gotten sick this time. Calm down, it's nothing. Don't worry. It's nothing. - Are you sure, doctor? You know him better than I do. I gave him a tranquilizer as usual. If you need me, we'll be at the wedding. Hurry up, or they'll eat and drink everything. They invited the whole village. You're not coming? Here's the tranquilizer. It's very expensive. Fine lad, this groom of yours. - He is. You didn't pay him, did you? I didn't. He told you it was nothing again. He said everything will be alright. He's lying! I know better than he does what's wrong with me! Why is the gate open? Who opened it? - I don't know. Where is Milos? He went to the wedding. To the wedding? Really? You feed your dog and it bites you. I'm going to kill him! Dad. - Don't you "Dad" me! Dad, we... We got married. You did what? We got married. Who got married? - Vera and I did. So... you... You got married. We have plans. I've been invited to an audition. They sent a guarantee for Vera's visa. Get out. We came for the wedding. We will go to the wedding. Dad... I... - Get out. Get out. Kiss your daddy. Welcome to the wedding, brother! Shame on you! I'm dying here, and you brought three bands! You're doing this on purpose. I told you. He's fine. As soon as he holds his gun, he feels better. Welcome, dear guests, friends. I greet you all! I also greet my brother. He is alone in his yard, and my yard is full. His daughter is here, too. Vera, say something to your father. Uncle, please, don't. Did your hear? Did you? Where are you from, kid? Belgrade. Belgrade. Now I get it. Get what? Why you don't drink raki like the rest of us. Here, drink one. Just one! Are you drinking or not? I drink beer. Beer's a girl's drink. Uncle... I won't! - Let him be, Vera. Just one. Don't be such a sissy. I drink what I like. Sissy! Leave him be, Dad. He's not a sissy. He's a good lad! To hell with you all! Marko, wait... After everything you've done today, don't show your face around here again. No chance of that. Let me go. You're just a... Just a... Let me go, please. I love him, Dad. Shall we have a little drink? Our kids will leave... and you and I will be alone. Come on, drink up. Good evening. What do you want? What do you want? Nothing. Just repeat what you said in the cafe. Repeat what? That Serbs are murderers. I didn't say that. Oh, you didn't? I said we don't know who the murderers are. We don't know, huh? I'm going to say it again: We don't know who the murderers are. He's fucking with us. He really is. If the Albanians didn't kill them, then it must have been the Serbs. Is that what you meant? Where are you from? What's it to you? Defend yourself, pussy! Take your hands out of your pockets! Defend yourself! Fucking thugs! Marko! Marko! Say something. Say something, Marko! Everything's fine. Everything's fine. Let's go inside. It's cold. - Don't. Someone will see us. We're no longer in the village. Now we're free. Please smile. I've never seen you smile. Please smile just once for me. Faster! We need to get there first. Hurry. Stop! Stop! Miss, do you have any money? - Yes, she does. I'm not talking to you. - But she doesn't understand. Calm down. The money, Miss. This is your first time in Italy? - Yes. He's talking to her. - But she doesn't understand Italian. Let her pass. - Yes? Go on, go on! Stay calm. Passport. Do you have it? Good boy. When did you get this visa? Yesterday morning. Do you know this visa is a fake? Yes, a true fake. - What do you mean "fake"? It's a fake. Who gave you this visa? They gave it to me at the Embassy in Tirana. In Tirana? Are you sure? Wait here. What's the problem? - You have to wait. Just stay calm. Come on. Move it. What's the matter? - Captain. Have a look. It's full of stamps from Kosovo. That one? - Yes, him. How long is this gonna take? As long as it takes. Stay calm. Nick Kodra? - Yes, that's me. We need to do some checking. Wait here. How long will this take? - Today is Sunday. The office doesn't open until tomorrow. Come with me. I'm here with my wife. - Where is your wife? There. - This is your wife? What's her name? - Her name is Maylinda. Maylinda Kodra? - No, Maylinda Klosi. How come your wife has a different surname? We're engaged. We'll be married soon. Albanians! You're all the same! First you're engaged, then married, then she works the street for 30 euros. Put your sister on the street for 30 euros. What did you say? Come back here! Where do you think you're going? Take him away! Take him away! We're gonna give you a one-way ticket! I'll send you back to your shitty country! Nick! What crap. Please, where are you taking him? Don't worry. It's just a routine control. Wait. Can someone help me? Can anybody translate for me? Come. Please, calm down. Calm down. You can't stay here. Wait for me at the customs. My wife is there. There's no problem. Just calm down. My wife is there. We'll help you. Go wait at the customs. Come. Come now. We've crossed the border. We're entering Hungary. We're in Europe, Vera. Are you OK? I'm feeling a little sick. What's wrong? I might be... - What? You know. No, I don't. What? You might become a dad soon. Weren't you on the pill? I was. Wait, Vera. Leave me alone. I didn't mean it like that. Vera, stop! Come out! Please, Vera. Leave me alone. Open up, Vera. Please, just leave me alone. I love you, Vera. Come out. Go away! Come out! I didn't mean it like that. Leave me alone, please. Come out, please. Hey you, can't you see it's occupied? Shut up! Leave me alone. - Come out. I wasn't expecting such good news. Just shut up and go. C'mon, Vera. Vera, open up. You two go left. We'll go right. Good evening. - Good evening. Your passport, please. Here you are. Vera, open up. Passport control. There's a young lady in there. Open the door. Come out. Good evening. I'm not well. I got taken off the train because of the dog. Idiots. I'm so furious. Hold on. Sir, my dog and I have often crossed the border and we've never had any problems. I'm sorry to have reacted like that. Is it true? Yes, it is. It's true. - Yes! Does it hurt? May I? - Here. Fantastic! Thank you so much for taking my dog and me off the train. Great job. - One moment, Madame. The next train leaves in three hours. Madame, your papers are in order. Marko, please come with me. Why? - Routine procedure. Come. I'll wait for you here. - You wait here. I have all the dog's papers. We've crossed a hundred times. And now they want a blood test. Idiots! There hasn't been rabies in Serbia for 50 years. It's the people who have rabies. Excuse me. The Albanian, stay calm. Leave him. - He's dangerous, inspector. Leave him be, you imbecile. Sir... my wife doesn't speak Italian. She's at the harbor. She doesn't understand. You've been many times in Kosovo? Yes. When was the last time you were there? Last week. What do you know about the KFOR soldiers who were killed? I go to Kosovo to work. I live near the border. I crossed over to make a call! Who did you call? I called Tirana. You called from Kosovo to Tirana? - Yes, I called my cousin. We were going to a wedding. I have to quit smoking. Smoking kills. You smoke? Yes. It's not good. May I have one? It will kill you. You're still young. My father died from smoking. I swore on his grave I wouldn't smoke. And look at me now. Sir, I have nothing to do with what happened in Kosovo. I've only heard about it on the radio. Listen, I believe you. But we need to verify everything. I can't let you go before that. Understand? How long will it take? - I don't know. Where are we going? - What's she saying? Nothing. Just drive. We're close. We'll be there soon. C'mon! C'mon! C'mon, faster. Faster. Fucking bitch! Where did you hide it? I saw him give it to you. Where did you hide the money? Shut your mouth, you bitch. Not a word! Albanian. Bend over. Cough. Cough harder. How many drugs did you hide? Good boy... Open up! Open up! Open up! No use knocking. They won't open up. They'll take us to the camp in the morning. What camp? - There's a camp not far from here. Are you also seeking asylum? What kind of asylum? - Political. I've run away with my family. In Serbia, you treat us Gypsies badly. Open up! Open the door! Who was banging the door? I was. What's the problem? My visa is in order. Yes, it is. When was the last time you were in Kosovo? I've never been there. It says here Kosovska Mitrovica. I was born there. My father was in the military. He was serving there when I was born. OK, we'll check it. There's no need for any checking. I have an invitation from the Vienna Philharmonic. I am a musician. I play the cello. My wife is pregnant. She's waiting for me outside. She will wait. OK, we'll check everything. But I have to make it on time... for the audition. They won't give me a second chance. It's the Vienna Philharmonic. I'm sorry. Wait. Wait for what? Let go of my hand. Let go of my hand. Let go of him. Cigarette? Thanks. Thanks. Where are you from? From Kuksi. Kuksi. Not bad. A little nervous, no? How long have you been here? Two days. Two days. For what? For what? I don't know. All I know is that my visa is OK. They said: "Blah-blah... fake." I'll give them fake, assholes. Why, what happened? My pal brought me a visa from the Embassy. I paid 1,000 euros! So how can it be fake? And you? I'm here for the same reason. - Visa? I'm not sure. They're checking. How much did you pay for it? Nothing. What do you mean "nothing"? Nothing. Not one euro. It must be fake then. Do you know what the problem is? These Italians are racists. They say they like us, but they can't stand us. Look where they've put us! With blacks! Motherfuckers!
