When she comes, tell her that I've left the job and I'm now working in Port Antonio. Would you like to speak to someone in the kitchen? Uh-huh, but not to Joe, please. The line to the kitchen is busy. Shit. Listen up. You have to cover for me. And tell Joe that I got held up, but I'm on my way. Tell him Ringo. And look, if my missus come, tell her that I left the job and I'm now working in Port Antonio. So what happened to the Ms. B? There's a call on the other line. I'll deliver your message. All right. Just tell him Ringo. And another thing-- hello? Hello? Well, well, [INAUDIBLE]. Sorry to keep you holding. Can I help you? Hi. Why is no one answering the telephone, Ms. Brandon? This simply will not do. No one in the kitchen, everyone asleep, I have to wake up the taxi drivers myself and tell them to go and pick up the guests.

Doctor certificate? What, sir? Oh. Well, you see, sir, the last time I had this complaint, sir, the doctor put me on two weeks sick leave, sir. But seeing that the season was just about to start, sir, and I didn't want to miss it, sir-- I didn't really want to let you down, sir. I mean, it's still tremendous, sir. But nevertheless, I try and come on, sir. I'm so sorry. I was a little bit late, sir. Cut the sir. What, sir? I had a report about you this morning. What is it, sir? Anybody doing that sort of thing is out. What I do, sir? What happened in the dining room last night? What, sir? Why you didn't serve Ms. Thomas? Oh, Ms. Thom-- who is she, sir? The social director. She said she was deliberately ignored for over an hour. Deliberately, sir? I mean, why would I do that, sir? I don't even know her, sir. What's she look like, sir? Come on, man. One Black face in the dining room, you can't miss her. But sir, I did serve the lady, you know, sir. After one hour? I mean, I was busy trying to serve the tourists, sir. Don't give me that, Smith. The hotel is only a quarter full. It's my fault. I come out there, and I wasn't feeling too well now. I mean, I try my best to look after the guests. You know, sir. I mean, I'm really trying my-- Look, I know what goes on in this hotel, so don't try and bullshit me. I know you waiters. You don't like to serve Black people. I'm a Black man, you know, sir. And there's no one to me like my Black brothers and sisters, sir. I am very conscious, sir, very conscious, sir. I mean, but at the same time, I do and the Frenchies, sir. I like white people too now, sir. White man, Black man, [INAUDIBLE] man, Chinaman-- I mean, we're all Gods children, and we all have to live as one. But every time I want Black men let me alone, you know, sir. I mean, what you say is true you know, sir. I know most of the waiters, sir. They don't like to serve Black people, sir. Why is this, Smith? What? Oh, well-- Have a seat. Oh. Oh, I'm so sorry, sir. Well, sir, most of the Black people come to [INAUDIBLE],, sir, treat waiters like dirt, you know. Call you boy and all that. I mean, sir, as a manager, I feel proud of you, sir. Because it's one of us, sir. I mean, but sir, I mean you have got to realize these facts. A Black man will come to the hotel, sir. You give the man excellent service, you know, sir. And when I'm done, I mean, if they don't report you and call you boy, they give you a $0.10. Lighter, Smith. Oh, light. I'm so sorry. Yes, sir, as I was saying, sir, if they don't report you and call you boy, they give you $0.10. I mean, sir, what $0.10 can do, sir? I mean, it's bad enough when a white man call you a boy and give you $1, sir. But when your own Black-- Smith. [PHONE RINGING] Telephone, sir. Nobody knows I'm here. Hello, operator. Yes, ask him to come and see me. Oh. OK, Smith, I'll forget about it this time. Just make sure it doesn't happen again. Thank you very much, sir. Sir, I wonder if I could ask you a little favor, sir? Not now, Smith. There's somebody coming to see me. It won't take a second, sir. What is it, Smith? Well, I heard that there's going to be a vacancy at the pool for a lifeguard. I know somebody with plenty experience in that line, sir. Ask him to come and see me. OK, sir. Thank you very much, sir. Now what is it, Smith? I know somebody else that could work as a pool attendant too, sir. Ask him to come and see me too. OK, sir. Thank you very much, sir. Um, sir, I wonder if I could borrow $10 from you, sir. I don't lend money, Smith. Sorry. See, I'd like to fill this prescription because you-- for the food poison. I really don't want to miss out of work another time. Let me have it back, Smith.
