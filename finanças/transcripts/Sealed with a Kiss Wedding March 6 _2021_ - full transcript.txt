Let us marry today. Let us join our hearts and our souls together in the union of harmony and love. Way too flowery. What? I'm your brother! It's my job to be honest. Oh, ok. Now what about this one. We will be advocates for each other, meeting challenges hand in hand. Facing our future as a united front. Sounds kinda military. Perfect. We can have the 21-gun salute and then I'll kiss the bride. I wouldn't stress about it. You've got two months. Yeah, but I write songs for a living. Why is this so hard? Well, maybe because everyone always expects you to be unbelievably romantic and profound. Oh, nice. I feel much better. What are best men for? - Hey! - Hey! I thought you two went hiking. Hey, um, how did you write your vows so easily? Well, I just thought about you and the words poured forth. Aw, do that! Thanks. Honey, don't worry. I mean, I know everyone just expects you to come up with the best vows they've ever heard, that's all. Look at the two of you. I'm glad you're so amused by this. Hey! I flew out here two months early for my tux fitting and I'm cooking for you while Duke's on vacation in Ireland. That's brotherly love. Yes, and can I please interrupt your brotherly love fest for just a moment and can you help me pick out table cloths and china for the reception? Why are we picking out Curt and Autumn's china? No, our china. Then table cloths and napkins and silverware. Oh, and stemware too! It's pretty cool that Curt Simms is getting married here. Yeah. Have you met his fiancée? No, not yet. Is she an actor too? Are we talking celebrity wedding? Paparazzi! No, no. Quite the opposite. All right, see you guys. Are you sure the first one was too flowery? Yes. Just read it again. No, I can't. No, enough! Just pour it out, like she said. As they headed to their next adventure, Mia scooped up Penelope and called out their charge. We can do it if we do it together! We really can, can't we? Yeah. Mia and her friends travelled far and wide. When suddenly, they reached a pirate ship. Yeah. Thank you. And what's your name? Aubrey. All right. There you go, Aubrey, I made it out just for you. Are you, are you Majestic Mia? Kind of. But my name is Autumn. Oh. But I do go on lots of adventures. And so can you. Oh! It means it's time for me to meet my special friend. And it's not an easy drive to get there. Penelope? Actually, someone even better. Are you sure you want to do this? Then I won't be needing this anymore. Hold onto it for me. And cut! All right. That's a picture wrap on Curt. Nice work, Curt. Thank you everybody, good job! - Babe. - Hi! How was the book signing? Good, the kids were adorable. Hey, Martin, this is my fiancée. The famous Autumn in the flesh. It's great to finally meet you. You too! Curt has been very excited about the chance to work with you. Are you kidding me? The pleasure was all mine. Trust me, this guy? He's just getting started. Wow. Thanks boss. Right this way guys. So what happened, we missed you at the red carpet thingy. I'm more of a jeans and T-shirt kind of gal. This is as fancy as I get. Ok. We're trying to stay away from the spotlight as much as possible. Really? I thought you loved the spotlight. It's me. I'm the one who's allergic to public exposure. Ah, ergo the shortlist on the wedding, I'm assuming. Yeah, that's the idea. Sorry. Hey, for the record I'm with you about flying under the radar. Best way to keep a relationship intact in my humble opinion. Yeah, well, speaking of weddings, we've got a flight to catch. All right, well you guys have a good time and we'll see you at the wedding. Thanks, bye. - All right. - Thanks brother. - Yes. - See you soon. Appreciate it. The old wrong stage door trick, huh? It never fails. And I've added another layer. Nice touch. Are we off-roading to the airport? No, but we're guaranteed to fool the paparazzi. All right. Ready to scooch? Scooching away. Married life, here we come. Yes. Wow. - This is very, very impressive. - Yeah, it looks great. Mmmhmm. I think I'm leaning towards the cream. Ok. But, what if we... Interesting, okay. Oh, I like it. Yeah? Wait, what about... this here? Oh, yes. Oh, yeah. - Yeah? - Yeah. It's perfect. - It is, isn't it? - Yeah. So what are you looking forward to the most? The cake. Mick, did I tell you the baker won a Michelin Star? Fifty-two times and counting. - I did? - Yeah. And what else are you looking forward to? The flowers. I really think the wisteria's gonna set the tone for the whole wedding. Mmm. The wisteria. Sorry. What are you looking forward to the most? Marrying you. Oh Mick, you're always the romantic. I'm just glad you're gonna get the wedding you deserve. No, we deserve. Well, that too. I'm sorry. Aww. It's Carl. Your old agent? Yeah. What does he want? He says he wants to talk tomorrow. There's something he wants to discuss. Discuss. Very mysterious. Yeah. Oh babe, please. Not this talk. Yes, this talk. We will be married in about a week. Can't you just admit you just wanna live in LA because it's more convenient for you? I'll give you that. And I'll also admit that I know how much you want to keep living in Michigan. Good. See, we're getting somewhere. But I'll also point out that, again, that you can work anywhere, I can't. But I hate the city. Which is why I'm thinking Malibu. We can't afford a house in Malibu. Not according to my accountant. We could get 10 times the house in Michigan, not to mention 100 times the privacy. Who says no to Malibu? I mean you've got miles of beaches, cute little seagulls. There's no scraping ice off the windshields in the winter. You can't do that thing you do and expect me to cave. Which is why I think we should table it until after the wedding. Fine. I'll table it if you guarantee you won't work all week. Ok. Agreed. It'll be a completely script, shooting schedule free week. Don't make me make you promise. Ok. Pinky. You're on. Victory! Woo! Oh, my calves. Oh! Tough hike, huh? Well, James practically ran up to the top of the trail, but I was the first one to the trail head, in case you were interested. Good to know. Yeah. Oh, Curt and Autumn are here. - Hi! - Hey! Mick, bro! Buddy! How ya doing? Good. Olivia. Good to see ya. Oh, you too. Well welcome, welcome to Willow Lake Inn. I'm Olivia. Oh, it is so good to finally meet you. You too. These are for you. - You didn't have to do that. - Nice. But they're beautiful. Oh, thank you. You're welcome. So, Maj, what do you think? I love it. I told you. When Curt first saw the inn he said that we would want to get married here. He was right. I'm Mick, by the way. We hug where I'm from. Oh, me too. Mick and I just saw the movie that he helped you learn guitar for and we loved it. Aw, thanks. That was fun, right Mick? You played that songwriter to a T. My guitar playing was next level and I can carry a tune. You can carry a lot of things, but a tune is not one of them. That's why we have such a thing as called dubbing. I'll get the bags. I feel like I need to apologize. For what? I have been very particular about the details for the wedding and you have been incredibly patient. Oh, it's no problem. That's what we do. It's just it took Curt and I a while to agree on what we both wanted and I want to make sure we got it right. I wanted to go big or go home, but Autumn wanted something simple. Well, that's why you decided on simple yet elegant. Erring on the simple side. What she said. But, you and I, we can talk about that later. I'm gonna give Mick a hand. Oh, yes, let's help him out. Welcome! I hear you're shutting down the inn for a couple months after our wedding. Yeah, well we have planned enough weddings to know to leave some time for last-minute hiccups. For your wedding? Mick told me. Congratulations you two. Oh, thanks. Yeah, it took a while but I think we got it figured out. Yeah. Why don't you guys go ahead, let's bring the bags upstairs and we'll catch you in a bit, ok? Great. - See ya in 10. - Mmmhmm. Ok, why don't I show you outside. So the guests will be seated facing this way? Yeah, that's right. And you would come in about right here. Oh! It's perfect. I am so glad that we are doing this here. Especially since Curt and Mick have gotten so close, It meant a lot to him that he could stay here last summer. Yeah. Wouldn't it be great if he could just do all his movies down the road? I bet he'd love that. Especially since we've been doing long distance. Yeah. How long has Curt lived in LA? About a year. Since his career took off. I've only been to Bangor once but I remember the orchards are so beautiful. I wouldn't live anywhere else. Oh. Hey, I love your work by the way. Thank you. Yeah, Majestic Mia. She's such a strong role model for young girls. How'd you come up with her? She's basically my alter ego. Ok. Which is why Curt sometimes calls me Maj. Especially when I get into my can-do mode. Just got to tell you from my experience, the geographics could be a problem. - Hi! - Hi guys. We got it all worked out. We're just gonna have a small spray here at the altar. Nice. Simple, but elegant. I sent your pictures to the florist and she will have something ready for us by tomorrow. Ah. - I'm so excited. - Come here. Hey!!! Look who's here! Hey guys! Olivia, Mick, this is my best man, Dev and his wife Jess, the maid of honor. - Hi! - Hi! - Hey, hey! - Hi! Hi, welcome! Been Best friends since high school, believe it or not. Wow. East Clancy Trojans for life! Those were the days. Oh, man. And now we hardly even get to see this guy anymore. Yeah, Mr. Big Baller Shock Collar. It's a joke. We love you Curt. We like to say Jess's edit button is a little glitchy sometimes. Ah. Which is why we love her. Ok, enough about me. We came here to help. Put us to work. Great, well let's go. The first order of business is a little welcome lunch by the lake, ok? Followed by a wine and champagne tasting later in town. Ah, here we go. Well this really is something else. Oh thanks, we kinda like it. So, Autumn, have you figured out your something old, something new? I have something blue, something borrowed and something old. But I don't have anything new yet. I have one word for that. Shopping! Cheers to that. What's he doing here? Who? Hey everybody. Sean. What's up? I don't get it. Me either. Who's Sean? Curt's publicist. I thought this was supposed to be a publicity-free zone. Me too. Hey, what's going on? Something came up. You couldn't call? It was sort of an in-person thing. I promised Autumn I wouldn't be working this week. Hi Autumn! What are you doing here? I mean, hi. Do you mind if I steal Curt for a sec? Of course. I mean, no. One minute. That's it. Excuse me. Hey, what's going on? I don't know. I'm trying not to freak out. That's good. Don't freak out. Right. I'm not. Never mind. I'm actively freaking out right now. I thought you would. Just breathe, ok? Breathe. Let's go eat some of that yummy looking lunch Olivia made us. He promised no scripts, no shoots. This was supposed to be our week. And you believed him? Right. Sorry. Lunch! Let's go eat. Just tell her. I can do this. Ok. Thanks for this. You know, why don't I help get you guys settled? Great idea. I'll help. So? What's going on? Slight emergency. The studio moved the release date for my movie and they want me to do an interview. In an hour. An hour? You can't get back to LA in an hour. That's not possible. They're coming here. Curt, this is exactly what we talked about avoiding. I know. I'm sorry. It could have been a lot worse. They wanted me to go back to Manhattan to do a couple talk shows and that would have taken days. I thought doing the interview here was a good compromise. Oh, really? Well, not really, but... If the press comes here they're gonna find out that we're getting married and then who knows what's gonna happen? I'll handle that, trust me. I'm really sorry. I'm wearing two hats here. I wanna make sure you guys get your privacy, but... He has a job to do and unfortunately PR is part of my job now too. You promised. I know. That's why I'm leaving the final decision up to you. We'll seat them at this table... Ah, there you are. Hey. Listen, I'm gonna go grab some things for Curt and Autumn's welcome bags and then I thought I'd take James to lunch. Oh great, that sounds nice. You gonna go into town with Curt and Autumn? They're still talking. Oh. Hey guys. Sorry about all that. Oh, no. No problem at all. We're just taking a quick look at the seating chart. Yeah, we were thinking of putting Curt's seat at the back of the room. Next to Sean. Or maybe the time-out mat in the corner. Yeah. Ok, well are we still on for the wine and champagne sampling? I am. Curt can't make it. Well, listen, we can reschedule if that's better. No, it's fine. We have a lot of things to do this week. Ok. Um, there's a camera crew outside. I'll go. You're welcome to set up anywhere you like. Great, thanks Mick. What about down by the pond? If that works. Pond sounds good. Right this way. Hey, are you Mick Turner? Yeah, that's me. My Mom used to listen to you all the time. Mine too! Right. Yeah, I'm big with the moms. Come on. - Mm. - Mmhmm. I definitely am going with the Bouchard for the red and the Dijon de Blanc for the white. I absolutely agree. But I cannot decide between the Oviento Frizzante and the Moon Bay for the sparkling. I don't think you could go wrong with either one. Taste? Oh, thank you. Mmm. Mm-hm. Oh yeah. Be nice if Curt was here. But, executive decision, I'm gonna go with the Moon Bay. Woo! Nice! That's what we're doing for our wedding. No kidding! Great minds. Yes. Hey do you wanna buy a bottle to take home? I might not have mentioned it, but my husband does have one to two brilliant ideas a year. Ok, it's a little bit more than that. Um, I'm also an excellent mind reader, which is a very good husband skill. You are, are you? I am. Then I guess you know which wine I'd like. Yeah, I know exactly which one you want. Come show me. Why don't we go do that. Excuse us. Hmm. So, is everything ok? It's just not a great start to the week. And I'm annoyed that I'm annoyed. Yeah, I get that. You do? I do. I mean, not that being a movie star and a musician are exactly the same, but there are similarities. And I know, it can't always be easy. Mind if I ask what happened? With Mick and I? Oh, yeah, well we met in college and dated and we eventually broke up because he went on tour. Any advice? You know, if I had it to do all over again, I think I would be a lot more supportive of his career and just less controlling. Less controlling. Yeah. What do you mean? I think that if you just focus on making each other happy, everything will fall into place. I like that. Yeah. Oh, they're back. Hey! Hi! You guys met my brother? We did. I see Mick put you to work. He paid for lunch, so I'll let it slide. Did you guys get everything for the welcome bag? No, we didn't get the individual jams, but I'm gonna get those at the monogrammer tomorrow. Thanks Mick. Have you see Curt? I think they're still down by the lake. Ok. I'm gonna take this stuff in. No, we got it. We are here to help. We got it. Thanks, guys. - Thank you. - Thank you! Thank you. Hey, hey. Have you talked to your agent yet? No, not yet. Ok, well when you do, be sure to get the publishing rights. What? Yes, yes. You know, for the big record deal he's gonna offer you. Oh, I'll tell him my boss said that. Ok, so last question. When is America's newest heartthrob gonna tie the knot? Your fans wanna know! I know. You know, I want to be as open as possible but I'm hoping they'll understand that I want to keep some things personal. Well, we are all looking forward to your newest action adventure, Winter's Chill is hitting theaters on the 6th. Very exciting stuff. Thank you, Nancy. We good, Guy? Great, Curt, thank you. Yes, thank you. And I can take that from you. Mmm. Pleasure. We'll see you again soon. See ya. Hey! How's the wine tasting? It was fine. Are you done here? Yup. I'll get out of your hair. Hey, we'll walk you out. Oh, ok. Great job today. - Yeah, you think so? - Really good. Yup. So, uh, I guess I'll see you guys at the wedding. Sean? What do you think about us releasing our wedding photos after we're married? I mean, that would be great. But I thought you hated that kind of thing? But this way the fans get what they want and we get to keep our privacy. It's a win-win, right? Brilliant. I love it. And the timing would be perfect with the release too. It's because my baby's a genius. But, would a wedding like ours look good splashed all over the magazines? I can help with that part. What are you talking about? I mean I can stay and help you out. Make your wedding magazine ready. I've done a ton of celebrity weddings. Not that yours is a celebrity wedding. Even though you're a celebrity. So? Are we doing this? Yeah. Let's do it. Ok. Awesome. Ok. That's great! Hi! What's wrong? I talked to my agent. Oh, yeah, what'd he say? Well, apparently he has an artist that's just off the charts and they have a national tour booked. Ok. And the opening act cancelled and they've asked me to replace them. As a solo act. No way! - Mick, that's amazing! - Yeah. Isn't it? Well, you haven't heard the rest of it. The tour would start in two weeks and would continue through our wedding day. Getting a tour is a good thing. Yeah. If I didn't love my life exactly the way it was. What are you... are you saying you're not gonna go? Absolutely not. What? No, I told Carl no. I've made that mistake once, I'm not about to repeat it. Ok. So, you went on tour when you were 21 in a van and we weren't even engaged. Mick, it's totally different now. Yes, I'm older and I'm wiser. Mick, you can't turn this down. You're putting two of those in there. Oh, right, thanks. Ok. So you're gonna go. Wild blueberry dark chocolate bar. Mmm. Mmmhmm. Bangor is known for its blueberries. Nice touch. You're changing the subject. Dying to. Mick. I want you to go. I wouldn't be back until November. After that we're booked until the spring. When are we gonna have this wedding of ours? You know, we could just move it up. Well that's a great idea, except I leave in two weeks. We can put on a wedding in two weeks. Actually it's less than two weeks. Ok, well that's not a lot of time but we are wedding planners. Exactly. Not magicians. Besides, we booked everything already. Well, I can un-book it. And rebook it and plan a wedding in between. Ok. Can you just do that a little faster. Oh. Hey, what do you think about this dress for rehearsal dinner? Oh, it's great. I think it's a nice compliment to my wedding dress. Have I seen that before? Nope, I've been saving it for something special, and now I've found it. One thing down, a thousand more to go. If it wasn't so true I would laugh. Ooh! Sorry. Oh! Are we interrupting? Oh, not at all. What's up? I hope this doesn't throw a wrench in things. A wrench? We were wondering if you'd mind me helping out with the wedding prep. Oh. - We would be happy to have you. - Sure. But that's not the only thing. Oh? Yeah, we were thinking of, you know, tweaking a few things. Not much, just- A couple upgrades. Upgrades? Uh, what exactly do you mean by that? We'll let you know as we go. If that's ok. Ok, yeah. Yeah, we'll just have to get our stuff done a little quicker. - Yeah. - That's all. Your stuff? Oh, we just had a small change of plans. What's going on? We're moving our wedding up a little bit. One week after yours. Oh! But isn't that gonna be a problem? No, it is not gonna be a problem. And it is certainly nothing for you to worry about, ok? Now I feel bad asking to change anything. No, no, no. Don't. That's what we're here for. Right Mick? Yeah. Yeah. And now we have Sean to help out too. Just like Majestic Mia says, for every problem, there's magic. Ok. So, I'm calling Party Rentals, the cake guy, the band and the caterer. Oh, and we need to reorder the wine and champagne, but we're gonna have to put a rush delivery on it. What about Kathy, can't she help us out? Oh yeah, yeah. I just talked to her. Not only is she willing to help with our wedding, she offered to help with Curt and Autumn's too. Oh, what a relief. I know. Ok, here are your lists. That is ours, and that is Curt and Autumn's. Well shouldn't we hold off on their list, given their undisclosed tweaks? No. I think that we should just keep going and hope for the best. Oh, these are big lists. Ok. Oh, and Mick, did you finish your vows yet? I'm working on that. Hey! Where have you been, I've been looking all over for you. I was looking for you. I thought we were going mountain biking? Yeah, yeah. We will. I mean, if we can. Look I need you to help me out on some things with Curt and Autumn's wedding. And why would I be doing this stuff instead of you. Because I have a wedding to plan. Right? I know. Look, these are the things for Curt and Autumn's wedding. These are the things for my wedding. I need you to do the stuff for Curt and Autumn's wedding while I do the stuff for my wedding. What's the rush? You're getting married in two months. Well, not anymore. Ok, ok. Now I'm confused. Look, I'll explain later. But, just for now, can you go pick up these rings? I appreciate it. I'll make it up to you, I promise. Well, can I at least go for a quick run first? Yeah, run and get the rings. Let me know if you need help with the vows. Really? So, are you biting your tongue about this bigger better wedding thing or is it something you're actually excited about? You know how hard Curt's worked to get where he is now. Oh, answering with a non sequitur is never a good sign. I am happy to make the changes as long as they are good for Curt's career. So, you are biting your tongue? Do you always have to be so blunt? I'm sorry, but the way I see it, squashing your feelings for your own wedding. It's... it's a recipe for disaster. Mmm. Is this the only spray you're having at the altar? Is there something wrong with it? It's really pretty. But? No buts. I'm just not sure. I already rescheduled your flowers for you so you can check that off your list. Oh, thank you so much. And I know it was last minute. I really appreciate it. You know I'd do anything for you. Now, let's get Autumn settled. Yes. Hey guys. This is Kathy Chen, a woman of many talents and a good friend. I'll be helping coordinate your flowers and your fitting, Autumn. Ok. Thanks. Any thoughts so far on the flowers? We all like this, but it would be great if we had something that really reads on camera. A real statement piece would be great. I made this up too, just in case. Oh, ho! Wow! Sure is a statement. It's so... Big. You know, I think you're right. But it's not that it's too big, as not big enough. Really? We need to draw the eye to the altar. But we could do that with color. Lots of different colors. Yeah, I like where you're going with that. Kind of like a kaleidoscope. Yeah, we could do tropical. We could carry the color through and incorporate some lighting to enhance it. Like a rainbow effect. But, tasteful. Tasteful. I... I have an idea. Are you thinking what I'm thinking? Do you think you could make it happen? I'll make it happen if you really want it. Ok. Let me show you this. So this is what we were thinking for our wedding. What do you think? I love it. You love it. She loves it. - You're not taking me out. - No, I guess not. Woo! Feels so good to ease into the day, doesn't it? It does. - Mm. - Hm? But we better stop lounging. We've got that menu tasting in 10 minutes. What menu tasting? At the inn. Sean's flying in this famous chef from LA. But what about Olivia's caterer? I though we both loved him. Oh, I know. But this guy does all the big celebrity weddings. Celebrity weddings? Babe, you're gonna love him. Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey. You're ok with all these changes, right? Nice bike, dude. What's up? Just got a call from the studio. They want you on a conference call. You're not gonna take it, are you? They said that they would only call if it was an emergency. Well, I guess I can't say no to an emergency. I'll keep it short. We also heard from Expose magazine. They want an exclusive. On what? The wedding. How did they even find out? Well, you did do an interview here. Which Autumn didn't want me to do in the first place. I can always just tell them no. Let me be the bad guy. I hate to ask but... But how bad would it be to turn this down? Yeah. That bad? Pretty bad. Oh! Wow! Amazing! - This looks incredible. - Hm-mm. Thank you! My pleasure, enjoy. Oh boy. Wow. Can I really eat this? Yep. Oh yeah. Wow. Oh good! Come on, we just started. Sean, this guy. I don't even have the adjective for the party that's happening in my mouth right now but it's something just like... woo! Good. I'm glad. What is it? Don't stress, it's all good. I mean, it's going to be. Autumn! A magazine spread? Seriously? I know. But really, it's not as bad as it sounds. Yeah, could have been 10 pages instead of five. Ok, good point, but you did say yesterday you liked photographs. From our photographer, not theirs. And now we're doing an interview after the ceremony? I know, it's a lot. This is what happens when I try to go with the flow. None of this would have happened if you hadn't given that interview. I know, but I can't undo it now, I'm sorry. So where does that leave us? If we don't let them do the exclusive, they'll probably just come anyway. Is that supposed to make me feel better? Yeah? Really, Curt? Ok, babe, I'm sorry, I know it's not ideal. But if we let them do the exclusive, we'll have control over it. And it will help keep all the other media out. How does the sushi taste, be honest? The sushi is really good, I already tried it. Hi! Hey, honey! You're missing out. Come, try some. No, no, no. I just wanted to let you know, I'm heading out to get my tux. Ok. We have Curt and Autumn's final fitting after this. Where are they? Probably discussing an upgrade. Right, right. - See ya. - Alright. See ya soon. Bye! Sean. Hey, if you needed to you could spruce up Autumn's dress for the magazine, right? Does that mean it's happening? Looks like it. But they're gonna be on a very short leash. It'll be like we don't even know they're here. And to answer your question, yes, I can style anything. Do you guys know that, um, Sean was a stylist before he was a publicist? I knew it! Oh, really, Sean. Wait, let's put you to work then. Ok? The final fitting's in a half an hour. Can I come? No. The groom does not get to see the dress before the ceremony. It's wedding 101. Huh, really? I brought fishing gear. No. Ah. Thanks. Cheers. You were right. I needed this. You know, this reminds me of when the four of us would go down to Lake Lancing and cause trouble. Aw man! By the way, that was you causing trouble, 'cause I was straight up angelic. Angelic? Mm-hm. No, you weren't. I was compared to you. Remember that time that you convinced us to jump off that rock? 'Cause that must have been like 100-foot fall. I never convinced you to do anything you didn't want to do. You have an extremely poor memory. Uh, you can be super persuasive. What, and being persuasive is a bad quality? Well, I'm sure it's got a lot to do with how you got to where you are. You got something to say? What makes you think I do? Well, for one, you know me. And you know I hate fishing. Just because you can convince anyone to do anything, doesn't mean that you always should. This is about the wedding, right? Mmmhmm. It just seems like you're pushing your agenda pretty hard. Autumn can say no, if she wants to. I mean, you know her. She doesn't have a problem holding her own. Yeah, but why would you want to put her in that position? You think I'm putting her in a bad position? I just think you're taking yourself and this Hollywood thing a little bit too seriously. Come on, man. You know me. I'm not like that. You didn't use to be. So, what? I am now? I just think you're walking down a very dangerous road, Curt. And if you're not careful, you might not like where you end up. You know we've never caught one fish, when we go fishing? Speak for yourself. You can? Oh, that's such great news. Oh, good, good, I really appreciate that. Thank you so much. I just rescheduled the minister. The band is a go too. Are we really getting away with this? I think we are, aren't we? Good news? I think we just rescheduled our entire wedding. Yes. Ok look, I'm gonna get my tux. I'll be quick. All right. Don't be long. Ok, good job team. Yes, we're gonna go get the invitations. - Yes, we're late. - Oh, yeah. Hi, sorry if we're a little late. No problem. Did you get my message? No. Is something wrong? I'm afraid so. It's about your dress. My dress? What about my dress? I'm afraid it's been... ruined. Ruined? Ruined? How is that even possible? We're not exactly sure. All we know is the box was... soggy when it arrived. Soggy? How soggy? Oh! We tried everything we know to get it out. It only made it worse. I'm so sorry. How did... How is it possible my dress has a permanent stain on it, no one can get out, and no store in the entire country carries it anymore, and I hate every dress in that entire store. At least you had it insured. There's that. But that doesn't mean anything if I can't find a new dress. It took me five months to find my old dress. How am I going to find a new dress in five days? First thing, don't panic, it's all in how you see it. Right. For every magic there's a problem. For every problem there's magic. Yes! If there's ever a time to channel Majestic Mia, now is the time. And I have an idea. If worse comes to worst, we're about the same size, you could... No. That is so sweet of you but I cannot take your wedding dress. All set? Oh gosh, Honey, I am so sorry but you are gonna have to find your own ride home. We have shopping to do. So sorry. Shopping? I need a dress right now... I will help you. We'll find you a dress. Thank you. True love is hard to find But when it hits you hard it's even harder to hide I've been searching high and low Way up in the clouds and rivers below Great. Oh, maybe not... maybe not the one. Next dress. I want more than just a lover I want more than just a friend That is exceptional. I look like the big mermaid. That's terrible. Let's get you a new one. She's the one, she's the one She's the one for me She's the one, she's the one She's the one for me She's the one, she's the one Sean? She's the one for me It's not awful. Are they? Is it pockets? Oh! Wow! How is it possible to hate so many wedding dresses in a row? Aren't there other shops? There are a few and you know what, we can't waste another day. We're gonna need to call all of them right away. This is a failure. I am sorry. This is not a failure because, um... Because now you know what you don't like. Yes. No, Jess is right. It's hopeless. Hold on. What about... this? Oh! I like it. Do you? I think it fits the bill. Where can I get it? Can I get it? I know the designer. I'll put in a call right now. If she has one, we can put a rush on it. I never thought I'd say this, but I think I love you Sean. Hi, Lucy. Yeah, it's Sean, of course. Listen I need one of those dresses of yours... We're going to have a little bit of fun, I'm going to go a little higher. Oh you're raising it? Ok, ok, I call, I call. There we go. What happened to you guys? Best if you just don't ask. She's right. Please don't. Looks like you guys are having a relaxing time. Yeah. How would you like it if we took a walk around the lake? Walk? Yeah, just you and me. Yeah. Ok. - Hey. - Hey. Everything ok? Well, yeah, still finding the right dress. But Sean found something that he ordered that might work. Well that's one good thing. Uh, please don't tell me there's a bad thing. I don't think my heart or my feet can take it. We have a problem with the flowers. What sort of problem? The florist called and there's some shortage on wisteria. They've only got enough to do one aisle way. Could we repurpose Curt and Autumn's? Yeah, if you want dead flowers. I think we gotta ask Autumn to go back to her original idea about her flowers. No, no. She loves the idea of wisteria. Well you love the idea of wisteria. We can find something else. Well, you sure, because I know how much you... Yes. I'm sure. Right? And let's not mention anything to her. She already has too much on her plate. Ok? And I'm gonna go order more towels for the guests. Well, at least you got a dress. Sorry it was such an ordeal. I wouldn't say ordeal. More like nightmare. Funny. But not funny. I just thought this week would be more of a vacation. Less of a chore. Why don't you take tomorrow off? We could, we could all go kayaking. That does sound fun. Hey. I know the wedding has sort of morphed into something else. You don't think I talked you into any of this, do you? If I'm being honest? Which you always are. It's not exactly what I wanted. But, I know that having a certain type of wedding is important for your career. So... So. I'm doing my best to roll with it. How'd I end up with the most incredible person in the world? I was just asking myself the same thing. By the way, when we were all down at Lancing Lake, the four of us, and you jumped off that cliff. You did that 'cause you wanted to, right? Are you kidding? Absolutely not. That was 100 percent your idea. I was terrified. I know you were planning on having a DJ, but how do you feel about live music? That sounds cool. Good. I was thinking of tasteful, but lavish. Like an orchestra. An orchestra? A small orchestra. With a string section. All very classy. Yeah, you like classy right? Classy's cool. It's not that I don't like it. It's perfect for the celebrity crowd. What celebrity crowd? Oh, sorry, the cast of Curt's last movie wanted to come. How did they find out? Hollywood's a small town. Totally your call, Autumn, but it wouldn't hurt to have some celebrities. The press eats that stuff up. Yeah. It's totally your decision, but you did say you liked those guys. Brent and Susan and the whole crew? Well, I guess now that they know, it's too late to say no. Here. Here. The cake guy's daughter had a baby. Which cake guy? Our cake guy. Ok, what does our cake guy's daughter have to do with anything? He's cancelling. What? His daughter had her baby early. Everything's fine, but he's flying to California. Oh, Mick. Hey. Don't mean to interrupt. I think we're gonna be making a few more changes if that's ok. Oh, of course. Oh, good. Looks like we'll be adding to the guest list. Oh really. How many? Ten or eleven and their plus ones. I hope that's not a problem. Nope. It is not a problem at all. We have everything completely under control. Ok, good. - Thanks. - Thanks. I'd say completely is a very strong word. Pretty strong, strong word, completely. - Mm-hm. - Yeah. Ok, no. No, no, I understand. Yes. Thank you. That's the last baker on the list. They're all booked. Anything on Autumn's dress? It's supposed to be coming today. I've got a lead! Ah! Cake or dress? Cake! Yes! Artsy Tartsy? He does cakes too, not just tarts. I already checked. Huh. I've never heard of him. Well at this point, anything's worth a try. Yeah. Artsy Tartsy! Hector speaking. Yes, hi, Hector. I have a wedding planned, not this weekend but next and our baker just cancelled. And you need a cake pronto? Exactly. Not to worry, Hector works best under pressure. Let me take a quick peek at my schedule. Ah, you're in luck. I have the whole weekend open. He said he had the whole weekend free. Is that a good sign? Shouldn't he be busier? Stop. So, when should I put you down for? Oh, well, we were kind of- we're thinking we wanted a tasting first, if that's possible? Oh, well, does one hour from now work? An hour from now is great. Yes, thanks, we will make it work. Thank you so much. All right, let's go get a cake. Eh! Got a minute? Uh, we're just on our way out. No worries, just wanted to let you know I'm flying out a gaffer from LA. Fly... A gaffer? A lighting guy from one of Curt's movies. Best in the business. Anyway, good luck with the cake. A gaffer? Oh, it's so cute. Yeah. Welcome! You must be Olivia and Mick. Well come, Hector has you all set up over here. Did he just refer to himself in the third person? Mm-hm. Oh, look at this. Looks lovely! Thank you. I have three samples for you today. All my personal favorites. That's my gluten free and kombucha topped with a cactus citrus drizzle. Oh. Ok. Mm-hm. Mm. Ok, ok. It's interesting. For a more surprising bite, I have the lavender and caviar chocolate mousse delight. Oh. Ok. Uh-huh. It's, uh, that is, that is, that is surprising. It's a thing, it's what sets me apart. I specialize in alternative flavors. Hence the Artsy. Well, alternative is good way of putting it. And last, but not least, vanilla tartar. - Mmm. - Mmm. I hope the vanilla is better than the fish and the chocolate. Shh. And if you're doing a tier cake, I can do all three. Or you can choose your favorite. Well, you know, I'm not really sure that the lavender caviar, really, it's not, it's really, not really... Doesn't go with our theme. Yeah. Oh, well you should have told me you were theme centric. Hector loves doing themes. No kidding. Last month, I did a woodland nature wedding. I went with a wild truffle butterscotch topped with a wonderful dill weed caramelization, that I think you would have loved. Mmm-mmm. Mmmhmm. What is a dill caramelization? I don't know. I thought you would know. I can honestly say I'm glad I don't. I'm really sorry you're not getting the cake you wanted. I know you were looking forward to that. Oh, it's ok. I mean... we don't have to do a cake. What if we did ice cream? No. You're having cake. How are we going to cake? I didn't want to say anything earlier because I'm an amateur, but cooking isn't my only form of therapy lately. You bake too? People have wept over my carrot cake. Well I'm not exactly sure that's the effect we're going for. I'll whip it up, you can decide. Now, you, go relax somewhere. I've got the cake. I'm trying to relax. I know. Do you think he can bake? I don't know. Who knows? Hey, how are you doing? How was the kayaking? Super fun. Nice. Yeah. Hey, Sean wanted to talk to you about the lighting guy from LA. Great. Since when do we have a lighting guy? Since a couple days ago. I thought I told you. I definitely would have remembered that. Sorry, I could have sworn that we did. He's awesome. Like we're actually really lucky that we got him. Curt, every time I turn around. What? Never mind. I'm gonna go shower. Yeah, I'm right behind you. Bro. That didn't go over very well. No, not very. Well, what am I supposed to do? I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place. So is Autumn. I know it's a tough business, but don't forget sometimes it's tougher than the people we love. Yeah, I know. Well does she know you know? I think so. I mean, yeah, she knows. At least I hope she knows. Right. A word of wisdom from somebody who's been there? Please. This entertainment business, you know, one day everybody loves you, the next day you're a distant memory. Just know at the end of the day, we gotta hold onto the women who love us. You might want to keep that idea. Thanks. Yeah. I'm really glad we came out early. Me too. Seems like we haven't had much time, just the two of us. Since we got here, I mean. I was thinking since you moved to LA. Yeah, well, I can't argue with that. Sorry if I snapped at you yesterday about the lighting guy. I didn't even notice... that much. You remember the summer after our junior year? Yeah, where we used to go jogging every morning before those terrible jobs we had. Hey... You might have hated working at the car wash but I loved working at the donut shop. You did have a pretty cute uniform. Mm-hm. Back then I could really see us together. Can you still? Still what? See us together? Woah. That's not really something you want your fiancée asking you a couple days before the wedding. You know, I mean, back then we made sense. We fit. We still do. I mean, you're practically a household name and I write books for six-year-olds. I don't know, those six-year-olds can be pretty fierce. Look at me. I'm still the same guy that you know from back then that used to hustle apple fritters off you. Really? Really. I can see us together. Forever. Ok? Ok. And by the way, that uniform was pretty... Cute. C'mon, let's go, let's go. He never stops moving, does he? No. He doesn't. Good morning everybody. Hi. Aren't you gonna sit? Can't. Things, to do, places to be. People to meet. All wedding related. Honest. What's going on? Sorry, can't tell you, secret mission. But I won't be long. Well don't look at me. No idea. Best wedding cake you've ever tasted? Mmm. I've done a lot of weddings. There's a stiff competition here, but this is so good! Yes! Nailed it. Mick. Come here, your brother is a genius. You've gotta try the cake. Yeah, I don't have much of an appetite. Uh, what's wrong? Our caterer cancelled. No. Why? He double booked. Ok, well, at least we have our band. Yeah, about that. No. The guitar player broke his third metacarpal giving the cat a bath. Is that even a thing? Is this for real? I guess we're not really gonna pull this together, are we? I gotta go. Olivia. No, no. Yeah, so I'm thinking that we start it here and then we bring it all the way down to here and ends right there. Got it. It's going to be incredible in this space. Yeah, it is. I'm really sorry about the flowers, Olivia. I feel terrible about it. Oh, no. No, no. It's not your fault. It was so sweet of you to let Autumn have this. Hey, we are getting ready to put up your aisle way. Great, thanks. Better get to it. Come on, guys. Thank you. Is everything ok? Honestly, at this point I can't wait for it to be over. Now that is not something a wedding planner ever wants to hear. What can I do? Nothing. Really. Anyway, I got my dress. That's one good thing, right? Yes! Can I see it on? Let's do this. Ok. I didn't notice all the beading in the photo. It's just not right, is it? I'm so sorry. Now what? Well don't worry, we still have three days until the wedding. This is bad. This is really, really bad. Autumn, this is your wedding, honey. You deserve to have exactly what you want. I'm gonna put out some feelers. I'll call a few more designers. And I'll hit the internet. Me too. No, no, you two are gonna relax and you're gonna go to your hair and make-up trial just like you planned, ok? She's right. We've got this. Oh, Kathy. It's coming together, isn't it? It's absolutely... Thanks Olivia. Thank you. Hey. What are you doing out here all alone? Trying not to think about the fact that I still don't have a dress. What happened? I don't want to talk about it. You sure? Very. Did you finish your secret morning mission? I did. Close your eyes. What? Come on. Close your eyes. Humor me. And, open. Curt. These are gorgeous. I thought with everything going on and, you wouldn't have time for a something new shopping trip. These must have cost a fortune. I want you to know how much I appreciate you. I love them but you did not have to do this. Yes, I did. You've given up so much on this wedding, for me. How many women would have done that? I love you. I love you too. I talked to another designer but it's too late to ship anything. Ok. Well, I did find one more bridal shop, it's about an hour away. They said they'd open early for us. I could take Autumn there in the morning. Ok, great. Special delivery. Oh, who's that for? I think you might have a secret admirer. Oh, there she is. Stay there. I, uh, I wrote something for ya. Hey, hey, don't you run away again I've been waiting half my life to let you in Now, come on over here Don't you run away again That was fun. Are you gonna use that on the tour? Um, well, I... I was. Was? Yeah. I made a decision. I talked to Carl. I cancelled. I want you to have the wedding you've always dreamed of. Not one that you settle for. Mick. That is so nice. But you know what, I've also made a decision. Oh, you have? I have. I talked to Carl too. You didn't tell me about all those cities. I mean, that's pretty impressive. Where are you going with this? You are going on tour. And I'm coming with you. What? Yes. Every band needs it's biggest fan, right? Well what about the wedding? Mick, the wedding will happen. The point is, I am marrying Mick Turner. Not many girls get to say that. Well, at least you know he was thinking of you. I know. It was super sweet of him. So what's the problem. This may sound bad, it just feels like I'm being bought off. What? I know that's not his motivation, it's just that now if I say anything it'll seem like I'm being ungrateful. You know, it's not too late to go back to the way things were. It isn't? You have the most amazing facial symmetry. Seriously. I know we said loose curls, but we must do an updo. You must. Sure. Let's do it. Autumn! Autumn! What do you think about your new house? Excuse me! Let her through! Your house! In Malibu! I don't have a house in Malibu! C'mon Autumn, we know you just bought a house in Malibu. No comment. What? No house warming? Come on, lady. Does it have a lap pool, pleasure garden? C'mon! So I want to be sure we get plenty of mics, ok. Curt! We need to talk. It was a surprise. Buying a house is more than a surprise. It's a statement. About what? Our future. Are we gonna live there now? I was hoping so. I thought we were tabling it until after the wedding. That's the surprise part, Autumn. You're gonna love it. No, Curt! You're gonna love it! Because you don't have to change anything! What are you saying right now? This whole week I have just been bending and bending and now I look around, I don't want any of it anymore. Why didn't you say anything before now? Because I was looking out for you. For your feelings and your career. And now I see that it was a big mistake. Autumn, it's just a wedding. If you don't like it, we can change it. What if it's not just a wedding? What if it's... a preview into our whole marriage? So, where does that leave us? I don't know. But I do know I don't want a life like this. You're not calling off the wedding, are you? I just, I need some space right now. Autumn, come on. Let's talk this through. No, Curt. No more talking. All you've done is talk. I just need some time alone. Jess: Ok, just playing devil's advocate, I'm pretty sure he thought he was doing something nice. Which is a problem. Because? Because that means he doesn't know me like I thought he did. Or, he does know me and he just doesn't care. You don't really think that, do you? You know he's crazy about you. Maybe we're just too different. Different? How? I'm a simple person. I want a simple life. Like what you and Dev have. We don't have a perfect relationship. Nobody does. But at least you want the same things. And you have equal footing in the relationship. And you don't? I don't know. If we do get married, what happens to me? Do I just become an extension of Curt, and his career? Now, that's up to you, not Curt. Sorry, edit button. Doesn't mean you're wrong. Mmmhmm. Oh, yeah, yeah. Looking sharp. Thanks. Mmmhmm. Now I just need a wedding to go with the tux. You know, I gotta admit I wish you had run that house thing past me first. Yeah, I don't know what I was thinking. Can't say I didn't warn ya. I know. You both did. What were you thinking? If you don't mind me asking. I guess I wasn't. Or I was and I was just thinking of me, not Autumn. Well, those bright lights can be blinding. I should know. I did the same thing with Olivia a long time ago. But everything worked out for you guys? I mean, you got past it, right? Yeah, after about half a lifetime. I just wish I'd have been a bit more perceptive about her needs. Would have saved a lot of time and a lot of heartache. But, what if it's too little too late? Well, I guess that's what you're gonna have to find out. Nothing's unfixable. If she still wants it fixed. - Hey. - Hey. Can we walk? Sure. Autumn. I know I screwed up. I shouldn't have made such a big decision without you. I agree. And I knew you weren't ok with all of the changes to the wedding. But you just chose to look the other way? If I'm being honest with myself, that's exactly what I did. If you don't want to do this anymore, if I hurt you too badly... Is that what you want? It's the last thing I want. But I can't just sit in the back with a smile on my face. I can't pretend anymore. I don't want you to. I want to marry the same strong, outspoken woman that I fell in love with. Autumn, the fame, the money, it means nothing if I can't share it with you. I've been pretty selfish. Do you think you could forgive me? It's not just your fault. I could have spoken up sooner. Maybe we can both learn something from this. Does this mean the wedding is still a go? I love you, Maj. I love you too. So silly. Aw. That feels so good. Yeah. I guess I should get going to bed. You never know what tomorrow will bring. Well that's for sure. Actually, we have a few ideas about that. We'd like to make some changes to the wedding. Really? And we'd like to move it up a little. Oh, ok. How much is a little? Is tomorrow too soon? And then you'll hand the ring over to Curt. You two have the rings, don't you? Jess: I do. Me too. Great. Let's see. Flights booked, both your parents here. String players cancelled. I think we're good. We're ready. I still can't believe you pulled this all together so quickly. You really are a force of nature. Ah, it's nothing for Sean. He didn't even bat an eye. Well, might have had one or two bats in the last 24 hours. I'm just happy you guys are happy. Ok. Let's get this show on the road. Yeah. Wait, you're not wearing that, are you? Well, I only brought jeans. Or I could go with workout clothes. I think I might have an idea. I've been saving it for a special occasion. I know it's not a wedding dress, but, I thought for a simple ceremony. It's perfect. Oh, wow. Yeah. Please repeat after me. - I, Autumn. - I, Autumn. Give you, Curt, this ring. As a symbol of my love and faithfulness. Give you, Curt, this ring. As a symbol of my love and faithfulness. As I place this ring on your finger, I commit my heart and soul to you. As I place this ring on your finger, I commit my heart and soul to you. May it be a reminder of the vows we have spoken today. May it be a reminder of the vows we have spoken today. I now, with great joy, pronounce you husband and wife. You may kiss your bride. Way to go! Nice work! Nice work! Throughout my life I've met every kind of girl I've been all around the world Some are diamonds some are pearls Precious and fine In a special way You're a cut above the others So girl I gotta say You shine Well, I think this worked out pretty well, wouldn't you say? One major regret. What's that? I wish I could have given you the wedding you wanted. Don't start in on that again. Oh, but really, do we even have a wedding left? Whatever it is, I will love it and so will you. I've never seen a happier couple. Guess that's 'cause we are. Thank you both for everything. I forgot to ask where you're going for your honeymoon? Well, we were gonna go to the Bahamas, but we've had a change of plans. Why am I not surprised? So where are you going? Michigan. Michigan? Exotic. We figured there's no time like the present to find our new house. And we talked it through and Bangor's going to be our new home base. We figured it's far enough away from the media that they won't find us or bother us. And we're gonna keep the house in Malibu too. A weekend every now and again in LA can't hurt, right? Definitely. Great job, my friends. I know it wasn't exactly what you envisioned but what we put together, it's pretty much my dream wedding. You don't know how happy that makes me. I think that's your cue. As you both know, we have a whole other wedding planned for tomorrow. And we'd hate for it to go to waste. There won't be many guests because of the short notice, but... As they say, sometimes dreams do come true. Hey, all right. You clean up good, man. Really? Well, thanks. Listen, before anything else, I just wanna thank you guys for what you've done for Olivia. We're just glad it worked out. For everybody. Mick! Oh, Mick! Nora! And Johnny! You made it. We almost missed the flight. Now what about Grace and Julie, are they here? Their flight was delayed. They're gonna be here later tonight. - Oh good. - And Duke? He's getting in later tonight too. We've just decided to just have a midnight toast together. Oh, that sounds fabulous. Oh, look at you, so handsome. Really? Are you nervous? You're nervous. Nervous? Well, my heart's about ready to pop out of my chest. But other than that. I must say, we wondered if this would ever happen. Oh, we always wanted it to though. Wait, wait a minute, now. Proper introductions. We have Sean, Autumn, Curt, Dev, Jess, this is Johnny and Nora. The in-laws. The fun ones. Nice to meet you. Um, Sean, thank you so much for arranging all the flights. First time I've ever flown first class. One of the perks of frequent flyer miles, upgrades. Yes! James! So great to see you! It's showtime! Yeah! Okay, let's get our seats. So. This is it, buddy. Yeah, finally. Listen. I really appreciate everything you've done for us this week. I know it wasn't the vacation we'd planned. Hey, I got to help my big brother plan his wedding. How often do you get to say that? Thanks, it means a lot. I know we don't get to see each other as much as we should, but I love you man. I love you too, little brother. Ok. I'll see ya down there. Here we go. Here mom. Welcome everyone, to the happy and very long-awaited union of Mick Turner and Olivia Pershing. Mick and Olivia would like to express their words of commitment and love to one another, as they exchange their vows. Olivia. Life has given us a second chance at love. All of my hopes, all of my tears, all of my dreams, have lead me here, to you. It's been... it's been a long road, with lots of curves and detours, but I'd travel it again, a hundred times over, because I've finally... because I've finally come home. And that home is you, Mick. It's always been you. And I vow to be your home too. Now and forever. For as long as we both may live. Olivia. As you know I've been trying to figure out how to say how much you mean to me. I even wrote this long speech. But the thing is, I can't do it. Because what we have, all the ways you've changed my life for the better, words can't capture that kind of love. There are no words for what you mean to me. Mick. Those are the best vows I've ever heard. Then Olivia, my one true love, the woman I want to spend the rest of my life with. With this ring, I thee wed. You may kiss your beautiful bride. Little over the top didn't hurt anybody. Happy wedding, Wife. Happy wedding, Husband!
