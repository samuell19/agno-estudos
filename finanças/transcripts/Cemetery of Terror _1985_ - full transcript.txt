CEMETERY OF TERROR Help! To the first floor! Yes? Yes, I'm Dr. Camilo Cardan. Devlon? Are you sure? I'll be right there. You can't imagine the things I told Olivia, so that she would come with us to the abandoned house. Tell me about those lies. I told her it was a party in a luxurious mansion... with jet set people. You have no idea. - How are you, Teacher. - Good afternoon. That's a good idea. I'll tell Marianna the same thing. - Here comes Pedro. - Jorge! Oscar! I invited Lena to the party. - Great. - Which party? The mansion party. You surely talked to Olivia. - Hi, what's up? - Hi. - What are you doing? - Nothing. Nice day. Guess what? What? Jorge invited me to a jet set party. And the rock concert? Who wants a rock concert if you can go to a jet set party? What's so special about it? Imagine! Television and the press will be there... actors and people will arrive in limousines. That's all. Speak of the devil. Always late. Hi! Kiss! What's up. Hi. It's about time! - Are you ready to ski? - Sure. Michel's waiting in the boat. Let's go. Let's go. I want to have a word with you later. Sure, but help me. - Oscar, where are Pedro and Lena? - I don't know. We said we'd meet in the house, but they never got there. They'll miss all the fun. What do you know? I've been waiting for you. - Hi, Michel. How are you? - Fine, and you? Come on up. - Help me. Help me. - Please. Carefully. Honey, where will you sit? - The recorder. - Your towels. I almost fell! Here we are. That was easy. Give me the towels. That's it. - Help me. - Be careful. Watch out. Come on, Michel! Come on! - Cool! - He skis well. Hey, Marianna. What will you do tonight? I'll go to a rock concert. Cancel it and come with me to a super party. I don't know. Come on! It will be fun! He's great! Come on! Here he comes. Girls would do anything to go to a party like that. - Really? - When did I make you lose face? - He completely soaked us! - We'll get you, Michel! - So good! - Look at this. Honey. Doctor! Sit down, please. It seems that you're the closest to Devlon. He's been under your observation in a psychiatric hospital. And I also know that he escaped because of your mistake. Captain, if you would take the trouble to read my report... you will see that it was no mistake. I did, Doctor, and that is why I called you. Take a seat, please. Your report and diagnosis are difficult to believe. If Devlon had no mental disorder... tell me why he killed 17 people... including his parents. Listen, Captain, I don't want to discuss issues you don't understand. I'm asking you to talk to the judge, as soon as possible... so that he may order the body to be cremated. No, I won't make a fool of myself telling him witch stories. Listen, Captain. You know little about Devlon's life. Like what? Like black mass? His prayer to Satan? No, Doctor. That body will be buried in a common grave. After the coroner finishes with the autopsy. All right. I will talk to the judge. Don't bother. He is too busy to listen to your stories. Pineda! Yes, Sir. I've been following Devlon for many years, Captain. He is not a man like you or me. He is a demon! Show the gentleman out. And tomorrow, I'll need your testimony by 12:00. - Here's the party? - Yes. Wait for me at the door. Are you sure this is the address? Sure. Do you think we are stupid or what? Yes, here's the party. - What a joker. - Give me that bag. I have a bad feeling. I'd like to know where are... the 80,000 guests of the jet set party? Don't you see, Olivia, that those are all lies? - I knew there would be no party. - What a temper. Stop being so posh. Welcome to the party. - You'll pay for this. - Why? Why? You ask me that? Funny guy! Come, on. Help me find a candle. - Let go! - What? Take me home. - Why? - I don't like this place. Don't tell me you're afraid. I'll take care of you. That's why you asked us to bring candles. - Stop complaining. - Olivia, the matches. Disgusting! There are cobwebs everywhere. - This way. - Yes, let's go. This is better than staying at home, isn't it? Well, what do you think? - Horrible. - Clowns! Change that look on your face. Let's have fun. You cut the nose crooked. You don't understand. It's funnier this way. - It's funny but it has no shape. - Who's here? A couple of little devils. Where are you departing? I'll wake the neighbors up so that they give us candy. Usi, Cesar and Tony will come with us. I don't want the neighbors to complain. Understood? Be careful and no pranks! Come on, bring your mask. - And your mask? - I don't want it. Did you have problems at your office? Yes, quite a lot. I'll tell you later. Give me a drink, please. Not here. I told you I don't like this place. Come on, Lena, don't be like that. This was Jorge's idea. Let go. - What's wrong with you? - Let go! - What's the matter with you? - I'm mad at you. What's wrong with both of you? You wanted to come and have fun, didn't you? Yes, we wanted a party, not this abandoned house! Don't be ridiculous. It even seems like this is the first time. We haven't come here to satisfy your whims. Okay, whatever. - Where are you going, Jorge? - Leave him alone. He'll get over it. And to think that I was going to go to a rock concert. Look what I found. "Devlon." And listen to this. "Such are the false apostles. "Cheaters. "We cannot neglect the one that we have in this world... "I am here to confirm my presence. "I exist in you. As in any other man." Who is he talking about? The devil. Don't joke with those things, Jorge. - Throw that book away and let's go. - Don't play with that, Jorge. - I think I found a way to have fun. - What do you suggest? - They are terrified. - Yes. If we frighten them a little bit more... they will fall in our arms. You're right. They've been fussy all night. It's time for us to get even. Hey, wait! "In nights like these I will incarnate in you. "You have served me faithfully. "I need blood. "Innocent blood to gain more power. "You will be so strong... that nothing in the human world will overcome you." What the hell are you trying to say? Tonight we will do something special. Are you saying you will invoke the devil? And with his power we will revive a dead person. You're nuts! What's your plan? We will steal a body. And we will take it to the cemetery. And where do you think you'll find a body? At the morgue. Please, stop. It gives me the creeps. Let's forget this. No! This sounds very interesting. The dead should rest in peace. You're such cowards. Let's all have some fun. I don't want to go. - Oscar, have you got the car keys? - No, Pedro's got them. Vicky, the pan! You've got two hours to collect candy with your friends. Sis, tonight's Halloween. Tomorrow there's no school. All right. Till 10:00. Not one minute more. Don't worry. I'll be back at 10:00 PM, sharp. Remember, Tony, that you are the man of the house. Don't leave me alone on Halloween. Don't tell me you're afraid of witches. Yes. Those are girls' stories. And thanks for dinner. - Here comes Tony! - Hi! - Hi. - Haven't Anita and Raul arrived yet? No, they must be listening to the Captain's instructions. Don't ring bells, don't break bulbs and don't frighten the elderly. Okay, we're here. Where do we start? The graveyard! Ride, ride, ride! - Where? - The graveyard! Yes, we said we would go there to pass the courage test. Can we pass it somewhere else? No, if they go, we will, too. My plan is to go to the center of the cemetery. - Count one hundred... - And then run away. Ride, ride, ride! - Where are you going? - To the cemetery. - Where? - The cemetery. - Come on in. - Great! - I'll go in the front seat. - Let me go in first. I asked for the front seat first! - Have you got the pumpkin? - Close the door. - Enough! - Sit with me. Hey, could you tell me why are you going to the cemetery? To visit my grandpa. Why do we use the back door? Do you want the police to throw us in jail? Stop it. - How are we going to get in? - Don't worry. With this screwdriver it's as if we had the keys. - Marianna, open the trunk please. - Yes, sir, whatever you say. You won't do anything. Get in quick and close the door. One of these doors leads to the amphitheater. Over there. I don't see how you managed to get that order. The judge is out of town. Can't you go faster? Look for the ugliest one, the most gruesome. We'll take this one. Get the stretcher. - Faster! - What for? Your body won't move from the morgue. Alfredo. Alfredo! - Good evening, Captain. - Good evening. This is an order from the judge, to cremate the body of Devlon. Don't waste any more time. We have to cremate the body. Follow me, Captain. This way. Oscar, open the door. Help me. Get in the car. Let's go. Go! Officer Pineda, send all your men to search for Devlon. - Don't worry, Doctor. - Doctor. Don't interfere with my men. - Captain... - I'm the one that gives orders. Captain, we have to find Devlon. That's your responsibility. "Because it is the 6th day of the 6th month. And the 6th hour." "Listen to my prayer. "We are here to honor you. Make yourself visible, Lord of Darkness!" "Because it is the 6th day of the 6th month... and the 6th hour..." Satan! "Give me proof of your existence! "We are your servants that ask you, we beg you to appear before us... Listen, Lord of Hell... This is our night!" - Stop talking nonsense! - Listen to me, Satan... Let's go back to the house. Listen to me, Lord of Hell... Enough! Stay if you wish, but we are leaving! I don't want to catch pneumonia. Give me proof of your existence! Wait! I think he moved one hand! Come on, Pedro! You're seeing things! Let's go! This is sacrilege! Let's go now! - Run! Go! - Why? He moved his hand! Wait! - What do we do with him? - Leave him there! They found a stretcher in the back door. The body was stolen, but there's nothing to be alarmed of. We'll recover it soon. You don't know the force we are facing. I can only destroy Devlon with the black book. What the hell are you talking about? What black book? If I had the black book this would already be over. Captain, this is diabolic, a damn nightmare. That's what it is, a nightmare. And here, my friend, we are all having nightmares. 911. Captain Ancira. Your wife called. Call her as soon as possible. Roger that. Over and out. Are you sure you want to stay here? - Yes, sir, thank you. - Thank you. - Thank you very much! - Hurry up, Anita. - Goodbye! - Have a good night. Hey, Mister! Why's the gate open? They must have forgotten to close it. Don't be silly. The cemetery gates are always open. Have you got matches? - Here they are. - Give them to me. Light this one up. Hurry up. I have to go home at ten. Yes. - This, too. - Thank you. Thank you. This is the last one. Ready. Which way do you like? That one? - Or this one? - The one on the right. - The one on the left. - Okay, this one. - Look at that crypt. - Yes, it's very damaged. Hello? Yes, love. Are the kids alright? They're not there? Calm down! All right, I will get... Come on, honey. Don't worry. Cardan! Cardan! Yes, love. Don't worry. I'll take care of the kids. Dispatch? Tell Pineda to pick me up as soon as possible. I'm in Rovenson Street and 818. Hurry up! Will you get me another one? - I feel very lazy. - Oh, come on! But I have to go to the kitchen, baby, and that's far from here. What are you waiting for? My kiss. First of all, my drink. Your drink. But don't go away. Wait, I'll be back in a minute. Just remember, we've got all night. Mariana. Come, Mariana, here's your drink. Mariana? Mariana. Did you hear that? - What? - Someone shouting. - Come on. - I heard someone shouting. It's your imagination. Come here! Damn it. What's wrong with this radio? - I'll go check. - Olivia, why now? Leave it till later. Oscar. Mariana? Jorge! Jorge! My God! Jorge! What's wrong? Calm down! What's wrong with you? They were killed! Who was killed? Who? - Oscar and Mariana. - God! Follow me! No! Open up! Open up! Hold it! Open up! - Where's Pedro and...? - Upstairs. Let's go and tell them. Pedro! Lena! - Wait here. - Don't go! - Come here. - No! Wait here. Hold this. Take it! Wait here and don't move till I come back. Don't go! No. - Damn it! What's going on? - I don't know. It's the weather, probably. Get me a drink. I'll be back in a minute. - Pedro. - Yep. Don't take long. Hey, what's wrong with you? How silly you are! Did I frighten you? You look funny. Couldn't you find the bathroom? - It was full of bats. - You're afraid of bats! Look out! Lena! Lena! No, I have no time at all. I told you that if you needed anything you should talk to Lupe Rosales. Alright, you tell him. My kids are missing. Did you understand? Very well. That's all I needed. A stolen body. A nut that steals my car and my children missing. - You mean Dr. Cardan? - Yes. Telling me about the devil's apparition. He's sure that Devlon is possessed by the devil. Nonsense! This is the 20th Century. The devil does not exist. Devlon was a murderer, a criminal. We shouldn't be worrying about him. Except that the body is nowhere to be found. I'd be terrified of coming here alone. Me too. I'll wait for you at the end of the road. Wait! - Wait! - Don't leave us! Tony, wait for me! - Hey, this place looks bad! - Yes, right! Why did we come here? - What's wrong? - I tripped over this thing. Cowards! It's just a skull. This guy's dead for more than a hundred years. We've walked a lot, haven't we? The plan is to get to the center of the cemetery. We must be close. We're almost there. Are you ready to count to one hundred? One, two... What is that! Run! Hurry up! - Hurry up! - This way! Run! Susan, is Tony with your children? No? Really? I don't know what to do. Yes, let me know. Thank you. Tony? Hi, Sonia. No, neither have I. I don't know what happened to them. They were together. Yes. Okay. Please come as soon as possible. I'm desperate. Okay, thanks, bye. - They might help us in this house. - We better go somewhere else. We have to tell them what we saw at the cemetery. About the fire? We have to call our dad and tell him. Let's get some help. Anita, we promised Mum that we would get back early. Yes, but what can we do? Where does that music come from? - I think there's a party going on. - I'm scared. Let's go. No. We've got to find a telephone and ask for help. Tony is right. Let's tell my parents. Is anybody there? What's going on? What's that thing I saw down there? I want to go! Calm down, Raul. We'll find a way to get out from here. Which way? This way! Hurry up! - What's that? - A book. Raul, no! The ax! We need the ax! Shut up! Let's go! - Open it! - I can't open it! There's another door! Have you heard from the kids? - No, and you? - I haven't either. I went to their school. Talked to their friends and nobody has seen them. Tony promised he would be back at ten. Didn't he tell you where they were going? Let's not waste time. My husband will know how to find them. We're back here! Oh my God, Adan! The children haven't come back yet! I will find them. I will find them all. They are the parents of Anita and Raul's friends. - Nice meeting you. - Nice meeting you, Captain. Sorry, this has never happened before. Our kids have never been out so late. We are desperate. You have to find them! Tony has never spent a night away without telling me. Something must have happened to him. I understand your concern. We are all worried for our kids. Let's trust they are well. Yes? Let him in. They found some kids. Let's see if they are your children. Are they your children? No, Captain. Take them home. It'd be really helpful if you and your friends search... while keeping in touch with us. That's what we are doing. Please keep on trying. And please keep me informed. - Of course. - Thank you. Adan, you have to find them. I'll do my best. Pineda! - We're lost! - This place is enormous! We have to find a way out! Raul! Come, Raul! Raul! Hurry up, Tony! - Help us, please! - Help us! - This way! - Hurry up! Help me! Hurry up! Come on, quick! Let's go! Hurry up! Hurry up, please! The ax, Usi! Quick! Usi! The ax! Hurry up, Usi! Hurry up! There they go! Let's go! Please, Tony, wait for me! Usi, it's not time to rest. We have to find the rest. Let's go! Cesar! Cesar, are you all right? Cesar! Cesar! Hold on to me! Give me your hand! - I'm falling! - Cesar! Help me! Help me, guys! Please! Cesar! Let's go! Nice, nice, today is Halloween. Nice, nice, today is Halloween. It's late for you to be walking in the streets. Go home. Captain, aren't these the kids we are looking for? No, these live in this neighbourhood. Let's go. Nice, nice, today is Halloween. Nice, nice, today is Halloween. Tony, open the gate! Come on! Hurry up! What's going on? Help! Help! Please, don't go! Move aside! Get in the car! Hurry up! Are you all here? - Yes, sir, hurry up! - Let's go! - What's wrong? - Why doesn't it start? The windows! - They are here! - What will we do? Out! Help me, please! Hurry up! Run! Come on! Hurry up! Look out, children! This way! Look at the tree! - Are you all right? - Did you get hurt? Run, children, everything's lost! We can't leave you here! What are you doing? Run! Here come the dead people! Take it. They won't dare to come near if you have this cross. Get back! All together! One... two, three! Get back! - Almost ready! - You're free! You are free! I won't be till I destroy Devlon with the black book. What book? The black book. It's the only way we can destroy Devlon. Go back! Go away! I saw that book in the abandoned house. In the abandoned house? Go get it! Burn it! Run! Burn it! - Take it. - Take it with you. - Take it! - No, you take it! Move back! Creatures of the devil! Go back to hell! Move back! Out of my way! Back! Get back! Hurry Up! Hurry up! There's no time! - Let's go! - Anita, let's go! Look out! Run to the chimney! - Now! - Hurry up Cesar! Let go! Help me, Anita! The book! Let go! Let go! Back, Devlon! Let me go! Let me go! Burn the book, child! Usi! The book! Hurry up! Usi! Hurry up, Usi! Burn the book! - Throw it into the fire! - The book! Don't worry, Captain. We'll find them. - I hope so. - We've been informed... there are children in the abandoned house. Please investigate. Unit 91. Message received. Over and out. I hope that report is true. 911 to dispatch. 911 to dispatch. This is to inform you that we found the children. Send backup and an ambulance... Take the kids home. All right. Come with me. Easy. Get into the patrol car.
