"This great evil. Where does it come from? How'd it steal into the world? What seed, what root did it grow from? Who's doing this? Who's killing us?" James Jones. Guy Georges, the alleged serial killer arrested yesterday, has been indicted for murder and rape and confined to a prison in Paris. The alleged "Beast of the Bastille" confessed to the murders and all charges brought against him. Counselor, any comments on today's hearing? Please? Monday, March 19, 2001 ...will it impact your client's defense? "The accused: Guy GEORGES RESERVED MARCH 29, 1998" Ladies and gentlemen, please! You okay? Good morning. You shaved? You look handsome. It'll be fine. You gonna be okay? Take off your sweater. Good morning, sir. Please stand. Your name is Guy Georges. That's not my real name. My real name is Guy Rampillon. Your profession? None. Residence? None. You are charged with 11 counts of aggravated rape, 7 of them followed by premeditated murder, punishable by life imprisonment. I want to say... I'm innocent of all charges. Shameful! Silence, please! Silence! SK1 This is Franck Magne, our new man. Good service, known for getting confessions and gauging weakness and strength. He's here 'cause he's a good cop. You should know, he was appointed by the big boss and yours truly. October 3, 1991 To become a detective, you start by shoveling shit and do what you're told - basic fact-checking with utilities companies... One fuck-up, you get the boot. Got it? Slog through the crew's files. We've got a dozen open cases. That'll take a good week. - Bougon will brief you. - They're unsolved cases. That's a tradition at "36". You've got a fresh eye. And maybe new ideas. So read, reread, wrack your brain. Don't hesitate. Ask questions and we'll talk. Here, we open all doors. And we close them. Till we find the right one. Okay, back to work. And get to bed at a decent hour. We meet downstairs at 4:30 a.m. Pick up at 6 a.m., sharp. Don't bug the new guy. Let him get acclimated. That's your desk. Thanks. Got a cop name yet? No. Another "36" tradition. You'll be Charlie. Franck Magne... Charlemagne... Charlie-Magne! Emperor of the rookies. Okay, everybody? That's a good one! Welcome to the Crime Squad. Charlie-Magne? Brilliant, chief! Work, guys! Talent's not enough. Magne, at "36", it's suits and ties! This isn't the local precinct. The open case files. Start with these two. Tomorrow's pick-up, the "Brise de Mer" Gang - various stickups, money laundering. And the Pascale Escarfail file. That one's our baby. Escarfail Homicide, Rape, Theft She was raped for hours. Sodomized. Then he tortured and played with her. To wind things up, he cut her throat. It was so violent, blood sprayed onto the walls. To your first day on the mythic 36 Quai des Orfèvres Crime Squad! To your childhood dream! And to our new apartment. To our new life. He is a sicko. A repeat rapist, but not necessarily a killer. Wednesday, February 28, 2001 The indictment's full of holes. The DNA, the Egyptian foot... Read the file, you'll see. Plead innocent and you're done for. I've seen him every day for months, to understand, to listen to him. My team is going over every single detail. I've hired a former magistrate and a former Crime Squad cop. I've dissected every iota of the case. I know every statement by heart. There's not a shred of evidence that he's guilty. A woman to defend a killer of women? I'm not forcing you. No, but you need me. - When is it? - In a month. Shall I send you the case file? I don't know if I can defend a guy like that. He's a rapist, maybe a murderer. He is a convicted rapist. But maybe not a murderer. He must be defended on that. Fred, if we don't do it, who will? Who'll defend this guy? I have a case I can't stop thinking about. A girl who was killed. Raped. It happened a few months ago. It's obsessing me. Tell me. I don't know. I was surprised. I didn't expect it. I didn't expect that violence. The girl was so young, so beautiful. And she suffered, that's obvious. STATEMENT "Paul cruised down the Boulevard Montparnasse... ...cut Vincent's throat." In the Escarfail file, I see that the victim's boyfriend described an almost identical crime, 2 weeks before the murder. He claimed he was writing a detective novel. That's incredible. Guillaume Reboul. He seemed fishy from the start. His reactions, behavior. Then we find out he's secretly screwing Pascale's best friend. We pick him up for questioning and find his shitty story. And a hunting knife. Normally, overwhelming evidence. But he's got a solid alibi. Airtight. He was home with witnesses. A pizza delivery and phone records confirm it. But we followed up. Tapped his phone, interrogated him. He never got flustered. We scrutinized his past. We dug everywhere. Nothing. Right from the start, none of our suspects ever stick. False leads that lead to nothing. We're stuck. We never get anywhere. May we help you? So... Asshole. Jensen. Another crew chief. A pillar of the squad but... another wacko. My advice, watch your step. We've got our share of freaks here. Grab your jacket, and follow me. These are all procedural experts. That's Coco's office. Jensen's procedural expert, Marco. Hi. He's the new guy. This is the dry room. Don't touch anything, it's still wet. This is Ana, our re-enactment victim. Hi, Ana. This is the pay-off. For decompressing or bawling. It's fucking beautiful! It does a man good. Pascale's face at the moment of death... Her mouth. Doesn't it seem like she's saying something? She knew the guy who did it. She was talking to him at the moment she died. We don't run into many innocent victims here. There's always a record or some shit... But Pascale, nothing. Try to keep a little distance. Or this case will destroy you. It's destroyed us. It depends on me? A little. Think I killed those women? I don't know. If that's what you think, don't defend me. I'm not convinced of your innocence. I'm not convinced of your guilt, either. I have two problems. The confessions you made at "36". Detailed confessions. My partner says the police forced you. Okay. But the Court will question you on them. Second problem, your DNA, which was found at some crime scenes. Powerful evidence. In 1995, the expert cleared me. It's not my DNA. Look, I also read the expert's note, saying he made an error on the 1995 report. A typographical error. Now he says you're, in fact, guilty. An expert who makes mistakes? They can't base an indictment on that. I hope not. I have one simple question for you. I ask you to answer it just as simply. Did you kill those women? No. I swear I didn't. Would you agree to another DNA test? Yes, of course. It'll either exonerate you or indict you. I'm innocent. I didn't kill those women. I swear it. They beat my skull in to get those confessions. And the DNA isn't mine. We need a real trial. Not an execution. The DNA results will come in before the trial's over. I want to compare the indictment with the defense. I don't want him condemned on a magic spell, I don't want him condemned on a flawed 10-year investigation. Why talk about condemnation? There's been no trial. The public and the press are against him. They can't convict anyone. We have to stop this media blitz. You can deal with the press. Control them. We have to make them think. Throw them off balance. To avoid a news saturation, and a trivialization of the trial. I agree. - I didn't say yes. - You didn't say no, either. We can go now. January 9, 1992 The kid's got a new lead on Escarfail. Pascale had just moved in. So I checked out anyone who delivered or installed anything and had her door code, etc. In case they came back. Go on. For the phone installation, France Telecom subcontracted to Sobotis in Dijon. I couldn't find a name. So I contacted local police, saying it was about the Escarfail murder. Stunned, the cop said Pascale's grandfather owns a building where a murder was committed. Fuck! I don't believe it! Holy shit! A girl, raped and murdered, 2 years ago. Case unsolved. Fuck! Shit. The victim was Sylvie Baton, 24 years old. Also a student. The police questioned Jean-Pierre Escarfail. Who's in charge of that case? Dijon Investigations. Captain Figaret. You and Bougon hop over there. I'll call Dijon. Good work, Charlie. Old man Escarfail couldn't have forgotten. No, it doesn't seem possible. Sylvie Baton was killed during the night of May 4, 1989. Her nude body was found in a bathtub full of water. Raped, sodomized and strangled. Undressed by force, bra torn at the hooks. Her clothes scattered around. Marks where her hands and feet were tied. Evidence of a break-in? No break-in. No mess, no rifling around. She obviously knew the assailant. All we know is she came home from a dinner out. That's the wire mentioned in the report. Probably cut to keep her from making a call. Odd because it's a simple electrical wire. Then we figured out it was a phone cable. You had to know that! Back to the phone installer. This is disturbing to us, Mr. Escarfail. A similar crime that befell your daughter, a year earlier in your father's home. I understand that it's disturbing. But... it has nothing to do with her. Pascale and Sylvie didn't know each other. They never met. Sylvie had a drug problem. That's why... Where were you on the night of May 4, 1989? When I heard about Sylvie's murder, I was in Barcelona, I remember. Alone? No, I was in Spain on business with a dozen people. I don't know why I forgot to mention it. It went right out of my head. Since Pascale died, lots of things go out of my head. I've tried to live with images of my daughter alive. Our lunches at the brasserie, helping her with her homework, her passion for photography and clothes, her sweetness, her terrible temper... and her desire to become a journalist. All that, I don't forget. But the end... her end and everything about it... that I can't think about. Okay, fill us in. I followed my leads. Sobotis says Pascale's line was installed by Frédéric Brunet. Young, single, a ladies' man, once accused of harassment. He shuttled between Paris and Dijon for his job. On May 4, 1989, the date of Sylvie's homicide, he was in Dijon. That's confirmed. On Jan. 26, 1991, the date of Pascale's, he was in Paris. He currently lives in Paris. Old man Escarfail was indeed in Barcelona when Sylvie was murdered. Dig up what you can on Brunet and haul him in. Give all info to Coco. I want the file up to date. Let's move! Okay, let's go! It's all yours! It's your lead. Police! Don't move! Against the wall! Calm down. - What's going on? - Are you Frédéric Brunet? - Yes! - Crime Squad. You're in custody. Keep quiet. You're hurting me! What did I do? - Do you have anything here, sir? - No. We'll search, we'll find it. There's nothing? You sure? Nothing to report. If there's anything, we'll find it. Don't touch my stuff! I don't remember what I did. I was in Paris but that was over a year ago! Does she ring a bell? You installed her phone line. She was found dead shortly thereafter. On January 24, 1991, in Paris. And where were you on Jan. 24? In Paris. What about her? Sylvie Baton was killed on May 4, 1989 in Dijon. And where were you on May 4? In Dijon. We know it's you. We know you were there. Let it out! Go ahead! Did you do it alone? Were you just a witness? Tell us! Stop! I've never killed anyone! I've never even been in a fight! What's happening? The doctor's here for the blood test. Take him away. On your feet! Step on it! Move! It'll be tomorrow's headline. - Shall we? - Let's go. My first question is how do you defend someone who everyone seems to accuse? Based on the case file, he has to be found innocent. It's riddled with holes. Especially the DNA. It should be indisputable and it's not. That's the lawyer talking. But as a woman, you must have an opinion. He tells me he's innocent and agrees to provide samples to shed light on the truth. He knows his DNA will be conclusive, yet agrees to the test. To me, that's an innocent man. You really believe that? I try not to believe, but to examine, to see. And in this case, I see no proof of guilt. People say you're defending the indefensible. I understand but I don't agree. So I'd prefer if you didn't say that. Aren't you afraid of being wrong? And defending a monster? There are no monsters. There are men and women. More or less sane. More or less good. I don't believe in the devil. What the hell is that? It's called progress! Congratulations, buddy! You'll go down in "36" history! Our first computer! Where do we hang your plaque? Humble and in the shadows. That's when we're best. But you owe me some cash. - 100 bucks a computer... - 100 bucks? They didn't fall off the back of a truck! I owe my wife. Old man Escarfail's never far... We put Escarfail under a microscope. All his alibis checked out. We've got nothing on him. Doesn't he deserve to be left alone? We can't scrape up much more on him. Even if his ways and his behavior are a little odd. How could he forget the homicide in Avallon? Why doesn't he ever show any emotion? None of us has lost a daughter. We don't know what goes on in a man's head at a time like that. The father's sincere. Lost and a bit strange, which bothers us. But sincere. The Sylvie link - I'm closing that line of inquiry. We've established no connection between those 2 homicides. Rule out the phone guy. I still think it was someone close. Someone Pascale knew. Not necessarily family. We need to cast a wider net. We should go through the Sorbonne listings and question all Pascale's friends. Thousands of students go there. We have no other leads. Call them in. Charlie's right. Does he always get seasick? Always. Strange for a guy with a fishing boat! Weekends on the boat are his thing. It makes us a tight crew. It makes... Isn't that your thing, Carbo? You okay, chief? His color's coming back! He's feeding the fish! You okay, otherwise? Fax for you. September 4, 1992 So... Anonymous call from a guy who claims Pascale was a paid escort for some big pharmaceutical company that provided girls to clients at trade shows in Paris. She was supposedly killed by a client at some doctor orgy. He gave contact info on other girls, as well as a Christine Saudan, who recruited the girls and knows who Pascale's killer is. Criminal Investigations verified it. The girls were Sorbonne students and Saudan still works in the lab's PR department. The call was made to someone here, on his home phone. The caller seemed educated and knew the case well, with specific details on Pascale. Reactions? It's bullshit! That lead stinks. Pascale was all over the tabloids. That always brings out nut jobs. That's all we've gotten! This case has been polluted by anonymous calls. Pascale never sold her ass to peddle drugs to doctors. I think something's dying to come out. We keep getting leads. Now another, 2 years later? Someone knows. We have to follow it. Maybe something is dying to come out. I hope so. But this is shitty gossip. We're missing something. An important element. We're doing a lousy job. We're all doing a lousy job! I wanna keep going. You wanna keep digging, dig. Anyone else? Follow him. Put Saudan under surveillance. Question everyone around her. Check them all out. Search her place. Bust the door down. Interrogate her, tap her phones. And see if it leads back to Pascale. Pascale, an escort... Don't put that in the case file yet. We have to solve this case! My mother, Hélène Rampillon... I bore her name till I was 6. And when I was 6, Social Services gave me a new name. Georges. My father's first name. George Cartwright. He was an American army cook in Marly-le-Roi. 1st day of the trial: Tuesday, March 29, 2001 He met my mother. Then he went back to the States. He was already married there. That's why he didn't admit paternity. Ms. Rampillon, Guy Georges' biological mother, was then a hostess in a bar in Marly-le-Roi. She disowned the baby from birth. Her parents, who raised her first baby, refused to take in the second. She sent us a medical certificate, excusing herself from the trial. She's never been around! No big deal. She's a stranger to me. My real parents are the Morins. At 3 months, you were placed with Mr. and Mrs. Morin. That's right. There, at age 14, you assaulted your foster sister, Roselyne. At 15, in 1978, there was a problem with your second foster sister. You tried to strangle her with an iron bar. She got away. My mother called the social worker. She separated us. I was put in foster care. Your mother? Do you mean Mrs. Morin? Yes. In foster care, you repeatedly assaulted female staff members. Between February 1979 and January 1991, you were convicted of 4 acts of violence against women at knifepoint, one indecent assault at knifepoint, and one rape, for which you were sentenced to 10 years in prison. Between the month of April 1992 and your arrest in March 1998, you were found guilty of various acts of violence and armed sexual assaults, one armed robbery, and one rape. Why bring that up? Stop talking about the rapes. I was already tried. I paid. But I never killed! You don't convict a man on his past! - Those are the facts. - The facts are consequences. Often the consequence of childhood, Your Honor. We're here to remind you. Where did Guy Georges come from? We should all ask that question. The assistant prosecutor spoke of his biological mother. But a biological mother who rejects her child isn't a mother. Grandparents who reject their grandson aren't grandparents. So where does Guy Georges wind up? In a foster home. After that, then what happened? They take from that child, who's fragile, wounded, the only thing that truly belongs to him, the one thing that's his and his alone, his name. And to top it off, they also change his birthplace. At 6 years old. At 6 years old, Your Honor, they rob him of everything. They steal his identity. After that, you do what you can. You try to grow up, to improve yourself. That's what Guy Georges did in prison. His behavior was exemplary. He worked for emergency medical services. He helped the homeless. In brief, he struggled against himself. Or rather, against the destiny he was accorded. Why? To break out of it. To become a man. A man. Not a murderer. Approach the bench, Mrs. Morin. He was a wonderful child. My little black boy. I wanted to hold onto him, I wanted him to be successful. He was my boy. I adored him. I raised my 7 children and 13 foster children. But Guy... I always held onto him. Until he assaulted his foster sister, Christiane? Yes. That day... it was serious. It was the trigger. Mom, they say things on TV, in the papers. But I've never talked to reporters. How can they say I cut off the heads of birds? You never did that! I've wanted to tell you, Mom... I love you. So do I. But now my heart's emptying out. - Here's your beautiful baby. - Thank you. My daughter! Do you realize you're my daughter? Don't you realize that? Neither do I. Neither do I. Attention, please! Your attention, please! Lady... and gentlemen... I pulled out my party tie because this is a big night. I lift my glass to Charlie Magne, emperor of the obsessional sickos at "36", who's just made detective. Bravo, Charlie! Thank you. I have another announcement. One you don't know about. You pregnant? No, I can't anymore. Bougon's leaving us to become the second on Lemoine's crew. Is that true? It's true! I lift my glass in your honor. To you! We've solved quite a few cases, you and I. We'll miss you... Take care. Thanks. I'm not moving out! I'm just changing offices. I'll see you every day. Let's hope so. There's one thing I'd like. One thing. Solve the Escarfail case. January 9, 1994 They found her this morning. Catherine "Cathy" Rocher, 28. Raped, then throat cut. Any sperm deposits? It doesn't seem so. The guy must have worn a condom. She was stabbed about 10 times in the throat. Probably left-handed. The medical examiner will confirm. Lots of superficial cuts. He must have jabbed her with his knife. Torture? Yeah. Probably to get her bank code. Her account was debited of 3,800 francs, from an ATM around the corner. The guy may have come back. The doctor found indications of post-mortem rape. To be confirmed. Bougon, come with me. - Let me see her. - No, Mr. Rocher. - Let me see her. - No. You can see her, but not here. Let me see her! They killed her! They killed her! It happened in the 12th arrondissement. The killer may be left-handed. We're not sure. We have a composite sketch of a guy that the garage attendant spotted. We showed the sketch to the neighbors. Cathy Rocher was very pretty, educated, calm, stable, clean as a whistle, and was coming home from a dinner. Like Pascale. Think they're connected? Not exactly the same wounds. Clothes were cut differently. But the same brutality. She was stabbed in the throat, too. It gave me the same feeling. He slaughtered her. She fought to the end. Her nails were broken. She was covered in bruises. Lemoine says Pascale goes back 3 years, so it's natural to have similar crimes. Almost 3 years to the day. He won't link them. We left a few cops to make rounds near the ATM, in case the guy lives around there. But he won't do anymore. Anyway... I'll dig around, talk to Carbo. I'll keep you posted. Thanks for the info. I'm bored to tears with Lemoine. Ten months later: November 7, 1994 Elsa Bénady, 23. Raped and throat cut during the night. Her throat hacked at with a knife. Hello. - Hi, Bougon. - Another victim. - I'll stop by. - Okay. Cathy Rocher and Elsa Bénady, same MO. Same cut between the bra cups, same Z cut on the pants. Same sexual abuse. Same neck wounds. 10 for Rocher, 17 for Bénady. Same body positions. Same jabs on the chest. In parking garages in adjacent neighborhoods. Both beautiful. Both tortured. Fuck. This distances us from the murders of Pascale and Sylvie. Pascale's throat was cut. She was beautiful, too. But she wasn't killed in a parking garage. Neither was Sylvie Baton. And Baton was strangled. It's not the same. We found a fingerprint on the back windshield and a fresh bloodstain on a leaflet on the seat. Maybe the killer's blood. Maybe not... Where are you with Pascale? Nowhere. One month later: December 9, 1994 Early evidence indicates the guy didn't flee the crime scene. He turned the place upside down afterward. He's an animal. Is that the boyfriend? Yeah. He tried to take her pulse, tried to revive her. He's in shock. Get him outta here! What the fuck are you waiting for? Cover the body as soon as you can. Agnès Nijkamp, 32, Dutch, raped, tortured, throat cut. In her apartment. - Who got the case? - Jensen's crew. - Did you talk to him? - Yeah. But Jensen's a lone wolf. He said he had some hot leads. That's all I know. - He knows the Escarfail case? - Sure. And Baton and the garage murders? Of course. He's playing it solo! - Meaning? - He won't share information. His guys have orders to keep quiet. That way, if he blows it, no one will know. If they all go to trial, he gets all the glory. But he's a pro. He wants to verify before saying anything. And the MO's not the same. They're beautiful, raped, throats cut! They didn't all die in the same way! Baton was strangled. The garage guy used a condom. With Nijkamp, he didn't. The links are possible but not certain! We can't group these cases so easily! He used a condom with Pascale. Give it a break with Pascale! What's urgent is... These girls were raped, had their throats cut! And he's thinking about his career? Shit! Stop! Does the Escarfail evidence still exist? Yeah. We couldn't extract DNA from sperm 4 years ago. There are new techniques now. We can at least try, can't we? I'll see what I can do. Baton, Nijkamp and Escarfail were all killed, raped, throats cut or strangled at home. It's maybe the same killer, don't you think? All these horrors you see... I'm afraid they're destroying you. It's the way "36" functions that's destroying me. If you're on duty the night of a murder, you get the case! Jensen won't link his case to ours because then he might lose Nijkamp. It's just a case file to him. Nothing more. You don't even hear me anymore. Yet I love you so. Benoît Duquesne is right behind... President-elect Jacques Chirac has just left city hall. May 7, 1995 All those motorcycles! Looks like the Tour de France. He looks happy. Mr. Chirac, how do you feel tonight? Just one word on your feelings. Are you happy tonight? They said no to the new DNA test. The judge finally decided the cases were too unrelated. He needed 6 months to "finally decide"? Shut up and go in. June 16, 1995 I won't hurt you. I'm on the run. I've got nothing to lose. I'll spend the night and leave in the morning. I'm hiding out, that's all. You have nothing to fear, if you do what I say. - Understand? - Yes. Where's your bedroom? - Downstairs. - Is that the light? Go down! Let me go. Hurry. Move! Sit down. I have a train out of France in the morning. I'll tie you up, to sleep. Can I have a cigarette first? I'll join you. What's your name? Elisabeth. And yours? You can call me Eric. You don't look like an Eric. Then call me Flo. Elisabeth... I can see you're scared. Believe me, nothing will happen. I'm just hiding out. By morning, I'm outta here. Promise. What do you do? I'm a psychomotor therapist. I help handicapped kids. Or kids with problems. That's nice. I'm tired. Just lie down and then... - I'll tie you up so I can sleep. - No. Don't worry. Give me that. Give me your hands. Trust me. Nothing will happen. Calm down. I could kill you. Makes no difference to me. Dumb bitch! You're really stubborn. Lie down, Elisabeth. I'll turn off the light. Help! Call the police! What's going on? Take it easy! The local precinct got the call. But it resembles the Nijkamp case, so headquarters gave it to Jensen. Resembles how? 11th arrondissement, knife, duct tape, beautiful girl. Fuck! They did a composite sketch. - Does he look like the garage guy? - No, he's a North African. Call if you need anything at all. Don't worry, we'll get him. Thank you. Vincent will take you home. Goodbye. Any DNA? Maybe on a cigarette butt. She even knew what brand the perp smokes. Nijkamp and Ortega were coming home from a dinner, weren't they? So were Escarfail and Baton. Beat it. Escarfail and Baton were both literature students. Nijkamp and Ortega, too? Beat it. Our cases are similar. We could connect them. - 3 murders in 6 months, can't we talk? - Beat it! Magne. Let me explain why you're gonna beat it. There's a little bitch out there who killed Agnès Nijkamp. And he may have just tried again with Ms. Ortega. And he's free as a bird. My priority is to nab him, whatever the cost. Not reopen a 4-year-old case, so you can sleep. Three weeks later: July 8, 1995 Same MO, same type of girl, same neighborhood. Hélène Frinking, 27 years old. There's a hair on the knife. Possible DNA. And this. That's an unusual foot type, with one toe longer than the big toe. It's called an Egyptian foot. Letters rogatory, ASAP, for the DNA. I want the results this week. I'll take care of the mom. It's all yours. Rush that over to Evidence. I want photos of the wounds. All the wounds. All these numbers. Careful of the footprints! The cops slammed a rifle butt into my head! They beat me! That's why I confessed! So there are confessions extorted by violence in this file. The same case file that implicates Guillaume Reboul, Pascale Escarfail's boyfriend, on whom there still remain gray areas... Jean-Pierre, Pascale Escarfail's father, on whom there still remain gray areas... Silence! A telephone installation technician. A recidivist rapist, and so on. Aside from those confessions, there's no proof! No more than in the Cathy Rocher case, in which a Caucasian male in his fifties, was seen at the scene of the murder and actively hunted for almost 2 years by the entire Crime Squad. Nor in the Elsa Bénady case, where the blood sample found is not Guy Georges' blood type! Nor in the Hélène Frinking case, where a bloody Egyptian footprint was found, and the best police officers in the Crime Squad spent years hunting the man that footprint belonged to. Then Guy Georges was arrested! He doesn't have an Egyptian foot. He doesn't. The DNA profiles came in. In Jensen's 3 cases, it's the same man. The genetic code's been christened SK1 - Serial Killer #1. Our first serial killer genetic code. But we have no legal DNA files to compare it to. The fucking law won't authorize it. Jensen's crew has worked day and night, trying every possible link between Nijkamp, Frinking and Ortega - their lives, pasts, friends. They have nothing in common. So this is officially a serial killer, plaguing eastern Paris, who seems to choose his victims at random. As for us, I made another request for the Escarfail evidence, to try another DNA profile. This time, the judge agreed. We should know very soon if Pascale's killer is the same man. If so, Jensen immediately takes over our case. Everybody understand? Coco will read an urgent circular from headquarters. "Crew chief Jensen will immediately launch rounds throughout Paris. All Crime Squad crews must make themselves available to assist. Witness Elisabeth Ortega has agreed to work with us to identify her assailant." Given his level of expertise, the perp probably has a criminal record. He must be in our files. Starting today, comb through all prison lists, registers, temporary leaves. Systematically target all prisoners, based on their record and MO. Pull out the most likely candidates and bring them in. It's a huge job, but it's doable. Go, guys! Crystal 10, where are you? Belleville. We're moving. Okay, copy that. We're at the Gare de l'Est. Nothing to report. Look at this face carefully. - Hello, sir. - Police. Ever seen this guy around here? - Nothing on the rue d'Alsace. - Copy that. Thank you for calling. Your sister disappeared... We're sending a flyer to every precinct. Every prison release form! That's not my problem! - Hello. - Hello. This is Detective Magne, from Carbonel's crew. - Shall we? - Let's go! Take good care of her, Charlie! Aren't you sick of making rounds every night? No. I wanna find him. INTERROGATION ROOM Take your shoes off, please. Right-handed or left-handed? Right-handed. You sure? We'll verify that. Think my composite sketch is any help? Honestly? Honestly. We don't solve many cases with a composite sketch. Less than 5%. But we have more than that. We have his DNA and we have you. That's not him. I just spoke to the lab about the Escarfail evidence. They still can't exploit the DNA samples. - Crystal 10 to Crystal 18. - Go ahead. We're at République, en route to the Bastille. Copy that. Crystal 10, we're at the Bastille. It's calm. We'll spread out. That's him! - That's Flo! - That guy? Don't move. Stay here. Stay by the car. Crystal 14 to all units. SK1 suspect spotted at the corner of Saint-Sabin and Chemin-Vert. Police! Freeze! Freeze! Police! Freeze, I said! Hands on your head! Hands on your head! I wanna see your hands! Your arms! Give me that! Let me see! Fuck! Shit! He doesn't have an Egyptian foot. - Who are you? - I didn't do anything. Get him up. - Why'd you run? - I didn't do anything. We'll bring him in. Bruno Bénady, Elsa's brother, one of the garage victims, stopped by this morning. Since Elsa's death, he's been playing private eye. Can't blame him. And it's paying off. July 21, 1995 He discovered that his sister was a high-school friend of Pascale Escarfail's. I don't believe it. If we had grouped the cases, we'd have found that out! And the victim's brother tells us? That could change everything! Maybe the killer knew them all. Got a list of Elsa's friends? We're on it. Get me the case file. Okay. Pull out the student list. Were you a friend of Elsa Bénady's? Yes. Your name's also in Pascale Escarfail's agenda. - Did you know her? - A little. In high school. Through her boyfriend, who was also a friend of Elsa's. Do you recall his name? Yes. Guillaume Reboul. CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS Yeah, I knew Elsa. She was a friend of Myriam's in high school. What is all this? Did you know Elsa was dead? - No. - No? No, I didn't know. When and where did you last see her? She quit school before graduation. I don't remember why. I haven't seen her since. She dated an older guy... Stop! Can't you see you're in the Escarfail case again? And now Bénady? 2 murders! I don't give a damn if she dated an older guy, unless it relates to Pascale or Elsa! Does it or not? - Does it or not? - No. His DNA doesn't match the blood in Elsa's car. Neither do his fingerprints. And with SK1? That doesn't match either. We've got nothing. Somebody killed that girl. A friend? Reboul? Old man Escarfail? The father's been cleared. I don't give a fuck! I need a suspect to keep going! To not give up! Stop with that! No one's giving up here! No one! We're all with Pascale! I'm committed, too. Just like you! I have a shitty life, too! Not finding this guy eats away at me, too! You're not alone, Charlie! July 25, 1995 Step on it! - It's pandemonium! - The RER station! Don't move! Call for help! The paramedics! 4 dead and 40 injured, following a mysterious explosion in the Saint-Michel RER station. We can't, as yet, declare it a terrorist attack but suspicions are extremely high. The Fire Department immediately launched a red alert. Nobody's owned up but the bomb smells like the Armed Islamic Group. There are threats of another attack, so it's top priority! The boss, in conjunction with the Prime Minister and the Prefect of Police, is asking the Crime Squad to assist the Anti-Terrorist Unit. We'll conduct waves of arrests in known terrorist circles. Crime Squad assignments are on the board. And the SK1 crews? What do we do? During the day, we're on the attack, at night, we make SK1 rounds. - That's impossible. - I know. Any questions? Thank you, gentlemen. September 19, 1995 It doesn't concern the attacks but we have an SK1 customer for you. Picked up 10 days ago for assaulting a woman in her home. With a knife. And he lives near Cathy Rocher. But the DNA doesn't match and he's black, not North African. His name's Guy Georges. A sex offender. The Juvenile Squad already gave us his name. We compared his blood with the Bénady samples. It's not his. His DNA doesn't match anything. But during the search, we found a knife and duct tape in his hotel room. Okay. Shall I bring him in? Your name's Guy Georges? Take off your shoes, please. Marco, make a note, he doesn't have an Egyptian foot. Are you right-handed or left-handed? Right-handed. We'll do a test. You can put your shoes on. I don't recognize him. He resembles him but... It's not him. You sure? He was more... mulatto. Take him back to prison. Good evening. The Khaled Kelkal manhunt is today's top story. Kelkal was killed last night near Lyon, where he's been in hiding for weeks. He and his group were linked to at least 4 of the 7 attacks or attempted attacks in France this summer. I just saw it on TV. End of story. I'm at the clinic with Louise. My baby's on the way. I'll meet up with you later. Thanks, buddy. - Mr. Magne. - Yes. You can come in now. It's a girl. A girl? Follow me. My second daughter. - How's Mom doing? - Just fine. Happy as a clam. Magali Sirotti. The same butchery. Here we go again! Two years later: September 23, 1997 - The same wounds? - Exactly. The boss is here. Gentlemen. Hello, Ma'am. - Hello. - Hello. No prints, no sperm deposits. No witnesses. Nothing. Otherwise, bra cut between the cups, stab wounds to the throat, beautiful girl... I got it. Thanks. SK1 is back on duty. Two months later: November 15, 1997 Estelle Magd, 25 years old. Similar MO. 11th arrondissement, too. We found this sweatshirt. Given the size, it's not hers. That's all we've got. We miss him every time. He kills, he stops for 3 years, he starts again. The last one was barely 19. How many times are we gonna look like jerks, taking the tally? Show me the photos. Marco, show me the photos. Blood was splattered on the walls. I've never seen anything like it. Look at her mouth. She was talking. She was saying something as he killed her. Yeah. Undoubtedly. - Charlie! - Let go! Charlie, give me the file. Don't be a jerk! The same killer murdered Estelle Magd and Pascale Escarfail. Their bodies are in the same position, heads in the same position, clothes slashed the same way. Same type of pretty girl. Same wounds to the throat. Exactly the same brutality. It's the same DNA for Agnès Nijkamp, Hélène Frinking, Estelle Magd. And Elisabeth Ortega, too. He killed Rocher and Bénady in the garages and probably Magali Sirotti. The similarities are obvious. We've been hunting him for years. He killed them all. Thank you, Detective Magne. Issue a wanted poster for 7 homicides and the attempt on Ms. Ortega. Call an emergency meeting of all crew chiefs, seconds and procedurals. Thank you, gentlemen. I spoke to Intelligence. Tomorrow's headlines will be "The Beast of the Bastille." It'll be hysteria in Paris. We must immediately change tactics. The sketch will be in newspapers, on TV, electronic billboards. We'll do rounds and random ID checks, like you did 2 years ago. As one victim's mother suggested, we'll search the Flo restaurants, and continue the ambulance and paramedic checks. We know the perp is muscular, so we're adding gyms and workout centers. We know he used an army condom. You'll receive Defense Ministry files. Scrutinize them! We'll monitor anyone leaving the country. Find SK1 and bring him in! One last point... We have the DNA of 2,500 sex offenders, here and there. Legally, we can't access them. Examining magistrate Gilbert Thiel and I have decided to circumvent the law. He's just issued an order compelling all labs to systematically search for SK1 in their files. Some labs will refuse. Tell them we want a refusal in writing, which will become part of the case file. And the next victim's file! They'll give in. Study those photos carefully. Fifth day of the trial: Friday, March 23, 2001 What's going on, Guy Georges? Your Honor, please, intervene. Sir, do those photos remind you of anything? Yes or no? Answer me now, sir. Yes, I've already seen them. Otherwise, they remind me of nothing. Of nothing? Yet one detail intrigues me. On the third day of the trial, devoted to the murders of Cathy Rocher and Elsa Bénady, an expert affirmed, here in court, that their clothing was cut with the left hand. Therefore, by a left-handed person. Your attorneys insist that you're right-handed. And you keep repeating it. Are you right-handed or left-handed? Right-handed. - Only right-handed? - Yes. That's surprising. You did hold the photos in your right hand, but used your left to move the mike and turn the pages. With the photos, yeah. Otherwise... Silence! Meaning that you strike with your right hand? Yes. Holding a knife, you stab with your right hand? Is that what you just told us? Silence! Silence in the courtroom! You say too much or not enough. What did you mean to say by that gesture? It's her fault I said yes. She tricked me. She set a trap and I fell in! It's a game to her. I'm sick of your bullshit! This is no game! There's too much suffering! But that was a confession - those 15 seconds when you seemed to say, "I'll kill you!" "And who cares if it's with my right or left hand." It's obvious, Guy Georges, that you're ambidextrous. Silence, please! Silence! He conned us by agreeing to another DNA test. To gain time, to put off the moment of truth. And the moment of truth is now! That gesture was a confession. We can't save him. You've got no right! We'll play our role to the end. Despite your scruples. Even if this case upsets you! It upsets me, too. I think of the victims, too. You're not a confessor, you're a lawyer! I have the right to be upset. And to say so. I'm here because you asked me to be here. We need a different approach. We all need him to explain. You have no right! It's not your place to judge. It's not your place to render justice. Your role is to defend your client. And you won't assume it. You can't do that, Fred! You'll regret it all your life. No one's played their role with him. Not his parents. Not Social Services. In prison, he asked to see a shrink at first and they refused. I want this guy, who'll spend the rest of his life in prison, who'll be wracking his brain over this for 30 years, to see a bit of light. Here or there. So he's not simply a monster, hated by all and misunderstood. That's my task! That's what I want to do. And if I don't, that may be what I regret all my life. Man is the only predator who attacks his own species and Guy Georges is the perfect example of that. He is and will remain a predator, seeking his own misery. Examining magistrate Thiel needs no introduction here. I have good news and bad news. March 24, 1998 The good news is the DNA has spoken. We've identified SK1. His name is Guy Georges. The bad news is he slipped through our fingers. That was on a 1995 sexual molestation case. We questioned him for the parking garage and the apartment cases. And he slipped through our net. His DNA was sampled and sat in the lab archives for 2 years. This is his photo. It's a race against time. We must act quickly. Pass them around. The Drug Squad, Vice Squad, Organized Crime and Street Gang Squads have joined us. I've alerted Public Security and Intelligence. As of now, we stake out all his usual hangouts 24/7. His squat, where he goes regularly. Foster brother Dominique Morin's home and restaurant. Another foster brother Eric Morin's apartment. His bank. And the home of Sandrine Louvrier, his ex-girlfriend, in the 20th arrondissement. I want a crew at St. Vincent de Paul where he picks up his Welfare check and his mail. The Criminal Records Office is now printing 4,000 mug shots like the ones I just handed out. They'll be distributed to every policeman, who will cover the streets. I'm counting on you all. Thank you. It's 7 a.m. RTL Morning. First Edition with Christelle Rebière. Good morning. "The Beast of the Bastille" now has a face. An RTL exclusive... Fuck! I don't believe it! What are those jerks doing? Shit! HQ to all units. Urgent change in strategy. New distribution of all crews. We gotta go! Crystal 2, to the Gare de l'Est. Crystal 3, Gare de Lyon. Crystal 2 to HQ, we're on our way. Copy that. Why'd they do that? To get a scoop? He obviously heard it. He'll take off. Crystal 4 and Crystal 5, go to Charles-de-Gaulle. Olier's crew is at Rosny. Pierrot and Pimprenelle, go as backups. Copy that. We're on our way. Crystal 6, join Crystal 3 at the Gare de Lyon. ID verified. Sami Moya, born June 24, 1960. No record. Copy that. Identity check concluded. - You can go. - Thank you. Have a nice day. Charlie and Coco, take République. A crew's already there. Do you copy? Crystal 9, to Etoile. Berry to Goutte d'Or. We're at Pigalle. Nothing to report. Police have now identified the serial killer who allegedly murdered at least 7 women between 1991 and 1997. We could call it a manhunt... HQ to all units. The airports are covered. Concentrate on the subways. Don't let him get away. Crystal 11, Châtelet. It's fine, they're here. Good morning, sir. Police. Take that off, please. Thank you. Guy Georges, 35 years old, 5 foot 8, a homeless man who stays in seedy hotels and Red Cross hostels. The police department also knows him... Berry to Goutte d'Or. Suspect spotted at Place Pigalle. Is that your mug? Is that your mug? You motherfucker! Suspect apprehended. Identity confirmed. HQ to all units. Suspect apprehended. Identity confirmed. - We've gotta get back to "36". - Beat it! I'm examining magistrate, Gilbert Thiel. - Are you Guy Georges? - Yeah. Know why I'm here? No. It's not me. Violette Karsenti in '82, Pascale Madec in '84, Eléonore Perret in '92... That's not you? Yeah. - But I paid for that. - I know. I'm here for the balance - Agnès Nijkamp, Hélène Frinking and Estelle Magd... and the assaults on Elisabeth Ortega, Mélanie Bacou... Patch him up. I can't explain my error. If there was an error, it certainly wasn't yours. You were in shock. And he may have looked different. You have nothing to blame yourself for. Don't let him hurt you again. What's going on? Let's walk a little. Saturday, March 24, 2001 I went to see him yesterday... He's stopped eating. He's exhausted. I agree, let's wrap this up. Let's wrap it up. I don't wanna talk to you! They forced me to come here. I know. I'm not your enemy, you know that. You can not speak to me. I won't force you to. - No one forces me. - No. You can even not speak to the judge. But tomorrow, the families... will ask you to. They'll beg you to speak. Because it will help them. You must understand that. They need to know. To hear it from you. You're the only one who can tell them. They're shattered. And even if... even if you caused their suffering, you're the one who can save them. Their pain is infinite. And they're waiting for you, Guy Georges. Not to judge you. That's up to the law. But to know. To acknowledge their grief. To find a bit of peace. You understand that. Elisabeth Ortega will be there, too. I know. You have to stop running away. You've been running away all your life. Like that new DNA test. What did that buy you? A month? Two months? But this is the end of the line. You have to look back. There's nothing to see. Yes, there is. And only you can do it. Wake up and get dressed. Time to see the judge for your indictment. How can he not have an Egyptian foot? Maybe he slipped. Step on it. Or maybe there were two guys. Charlie! Jensen wants to see you. He's ready. He wants to talk about Pascale Escarfail. You have to interrogate him now. He's ripe. Make him confess. Let's finish this tonight. Shall I leave you? Yes, please. Have a seat. We're both here because... you have to talk about the past. How one night you became a killer. Would you like to? Yeah. Tell me about the beginning of 1991. January 24th. Pascale Escarfail. Did you know her? No. You'd been in prison in Caen. For 7 years. And that night was your first leave. Yeah. You were serving a sentence for rape. Yeah. I'd just gotten a temporary leave. I was supposed to come back every night. That night I was late and... I decided not to go back to jail. I went to the movies. I saw several films. In Montparnasse? Yes. And afterward? I had a drink in an outdoor café. Then what happened? When I woke up that morning, I knew I'd kill before nightfall. The idea stuck in my head. I'd felt that before... that kind of compulsion. I took a knife and some duct tape and... that night that beautiful girl walked by. I liked her right away. She turned me on. She was beautiful. Blonde, small, all in black, in a sexy dress and stockings. I'd just finished my beer. I paid, the waiter gave me my change. I followed the girl. To her place? Yeah. She entered the door code. I slipped in behind her. I passed her on the stairs. I went to the top floor. So did she. On the last step, she was surprised to see me. She asked what I wanted. I pulled out my knife and said, "You." I made her open the door. She turned on the light and rushed to the phone but I stopped her. She didn't scream. She was too scared. I sat her on the bed and tied her wrists with duct tape. I said it wasn't sexual. She seemed a bit reassured. We talked for a while. She said she was a student, her name was Pascale. I told her a bunch of bullshit. That I was a Gulf War refugee on the lam. That's why I tied her up, so I could rest up at her place. And... after you talked? I took off her shoes and pantyhose. I took off her dress and cut the sides of her panties. I also cut her bra, in front. She was scared. She went along without saying much. I asked her to suck me off. She did it. Then... I penetrated her... several times. She was terrified. ...and stabbed her in the throat to punish her. US: Did she die right away? GUY GEORGES: No. She managed to loosen the tape on her mouth. Despite her throat, she spoke to me. She looked me right in the eye and whispered, "What are you doing? Are you killing me?" I stabbed her 2 or 3 times in the throat and the carotid. I knew that'd kill her fast. I held her till she stopped moving. She still seemed to be speaking after she was dead. Afterwards... I washed my hands. I felt better. So I had a beer I found there. And I left to catch the last subway. That night, if you hadn't finished your beer and hadn't gotten your change, what would have happened? It would've been someone else. Why did you kill them, Guy? My mother... But it's more complicated than that. I won't go back on my confession. If I get out of prison, I'll start again. I won't appeal when I'm convicted. I promise, Detective. I didn't expect to find you in this courtyard. It connects to "36", too. A beeline to justice! You on one side, me on the other. You accuse, I defend. And we meet in the middle. Except, I don't accuse. I realize that you did an impressive job. It's strange to say that but that's what I think. Thank you. I'm just the guy who tracked the monster for 7 years. Someone had to. And I track the man behind the monster. Counselor, I haven't liked you much these past few days. But I was wrong. You're doing a good job. I think so, too. Silence. Silence, please. What a hypocrite! Silence! Counselor Pons. Seventh day of the trial: Tuesday, March 27, 2001 Guy Georges, yesterday afternoon, you refused to answer questions on the murder of Agnès Nijkamp. Would you like to answer them today? No. Because you feel guilty? People say you're a monster. Your mother reads that everywhere. But there's more to you than a monster. I ask you to prove me right... and to speak. Free yourself. Free us. If you have anything to say, this is the place. And the time. In a few moments, the only survivor, Elisabeth Ortega, will testify. And no one will bear this silence. Neither the families, nor her, nor us. If you were the assailant, I ask you to say so. No. Guy Georges... For all these families, these mothers and sisters of the victims. For your family... your father, George Cartwright, wherever he may be, so they can forgive you. If you're carrying a burden that's too heavy, let it out. Did you assault Elisabeth Ortega? We didn't quite hear you. Did you assault Ms. Ortega? Yes. Did you kill Ms. Escarfail? Yes. Did you kill Ms. Rocher? Yes. Thank you. Did you kill Ms. Bénady? Yes. Ms. Nijkamp? Yes. Ms. Frinking? Yes. Ms. Sirotti? Yes. Ms. Magd? Yes. Franck Magne Crew He confessed. All the murders. Thank you. Humble and in the Shadows On April 5, 2001, the Paris Criminal Court sentenced Guy Georges to life imprisonment, with a minimum term of 22 years. He did not appeal. He is legally eligible for parole in 2020. After Guy Georges' arrest, the Automated National File of Genetic Prints (FNAEG) was created in France, on June 17, 1998. By January 1, 2010, it had made 100,000 DNA matches, helping to solve all kinds of cases. Jean-Pierre Escarfail campaigned for the French government to create a national DNA database and electronic bracelet. He continues to fight for victims' rights and to facilitate their access to justice. Elisabeth Ortega paid homage to the 7 victims in the trial, calling them, "her blood sisters." She has since refused to speak publicly. Frédérique Pons continues to plead criminal cases. After over 15 years of duty, Charlie left the Crime Squad in 2007, and no longer conducts investigations. The 1989 murder of Sylvie Baton, in the Escarfail building in Avallon, was solved in 2007. Ulrich Müenstermann, already in prison in Germany for 3 rapes and a murder, was identified by his DNA.
