[The Fate of Swordsman] It is the commencement of the Great Tang Shenlong's Reign. Tang Zhongzong is fatuous. The empress from the Wei Clan beholds the power. Upon an alliance with Wu Sansi, they encouraged Zhongzong to summon his youngest prince, Li Chongmao, to return to the royal palace. This, as a means to keep the Crown Prince, Li Chongjun, under their clasp. Chunyang Temple Headmaster, Li Dongbin, dispatched his eldest disciple, Xie Yunliu, to escort Li Chongmao to journey back to Chang'An. Chongmao, have you given any thoughts to what you're going to do when you return to your father? I don't even remember what my father looks like. That's because you've been in Chunyang Temple for too long. To me, father isn't as close to me as Senior Brother is. But I can't protect you all your life. Why not? It's better if you return back to the palace with me. Could it be that you want me to accompany you even when you're married? I'm not going to get married. Hey, Senior Brother, there's a roadside tea stall over there. Let's go over to rest a bit. All right. What would the two of you like? We would like some basic dishes. Choose some simple and fresh dishes for us. All right. Chongmao, are you not happy about going to Chang'An City (the Capital)? This time returning to the palace, I'm afraid I won't be able to return back to Chunyang Temple. I'll miss you all. The palace is your home after all. Just stay there and not worry. I understand, Senior Brother. Senior Brother, looking at the banners and the decorations, the horse carriage looks like my royal brother's. Crown Prince? Assassins! Protect the Crown Prince! Form a wall! Princess, please forgive me for being late. You're so late. If I relied on you to save me, my corpse would have gone cold by now. I understand my mistakes. The Crown Prince will be here soon. Seal off the forest to search right away! None of the assassins are to escape today! Yes. Please, wait, Hero. I'm the Eldest Disciple of Chunyang Temple. Greetings, Your Highness Princess. I'm guessing that you're here because you're sending Chongmao back to the capital. I'm Chongmao's older sister, Li Huawan. Senior Brother! - Senior Brother, Senior Brother are you okay?- I'm all right. I was scared to death just now. It's good that you're all right. Chongmao, those assassins were attacking my carriage. Chongmao, come. Say hello to your royal sister. I haven't seen you for so long; you've grown up a little. It's you, Third Sister? It's good that you are all right. It's all thanks to your senior brother this time; otherwise, you'll probably wouldn't have seen your sister again. Actually, I thought the Crown Prince was in the horse carriage. I never thought it was you, Princess, in there. Third Sister has always been a tomboy. She likes dressing like a man when traveling. Who would have thought so many years have passed, she hasn't changed one bit. Huawan, it has been tough for you. I can't take the credit. Wu Dan is a scoundrel. He dares to bomb the carriage. Fortunately, you were in it. Have you captured the assassins? We've discovered six dead bodies in the forest and the eight around the carriage were all killed off. These few good-for-nothings are not worth mentioning. Since Crown Prince is all right, why don't you hurry back to the palace? I am the Crown Prince. I met up with assassins 30 miles from the capital. To return to the capital with my tail between my legs, I'll be a laughing stock to everyone. This is... Chongmao pays respects to the Crown Prince. You are Chongmao? Did Royal Father ask you to return to the capital? I've been at Chunyang Temple for seven years. Father has always thought of me. So that's why Teacher asked Senior Brother to send me back to the capital. I'm Chunyang Temples Eldest Disciple, Xie Yunliu. Master Xie was escorting Chongmao back to the capital; and fortunately, he saw my entourage getting attacked and saved me. This is your reward. I think that isn't too little. In a few days, I'm holding a banquet. Take this pouch to enter the Palace to attend the banquet. Escort the Crown Prince back to the palace. General, I would have never thought the Crown Prince was not inside the carriage. He actually let the Princess be the slaughter lamb. This must have leaked out; otherwise, this mistake wouldn't have happened! I'm innocent General. The people I've trained are all trustworthy. Someone whom I can't control! What's the use of having you around? Duke Liang will not like this either. Senior Brother, Third Sister told me that tomorrow night Third Brother will hold a banquet as a welcome dinner for me. But I haven't seen Third Brother for so many years, I'm a little afraid. Don't worry, the Princess has invited me along. I'll accompany you. Really? That's fantastic. With you there, I'm not afraid of anything. Chongmao, when you get back to the Palace, there are so many delicacies and famous dishes. When that time comes, you won't want to go back to Chunyang. Senior Brother, the palace is so good. Why don't we go there together? Have you forgotten? I still need to go to the Hidden Sword Mountain Village to attend the Fame Sword meeting. Yes. Princess. When we get to Chang'An, Hero, you should stay a few days. Let me take good care of you. You're being too polite. In two nights, I have to attend Crown Prince's banquet. I will be leaving for Hangzhou soon. Is Young Warrior going there for leisure? My senior brother has to go to the Hidden Sword Mountain Village to attend the Fame Sword meeting. Fame Sword meeting? In Hidden Sword Mountain Village, only the sector leaders of a clan can enter into the Kung Fu competition. My senior brother is entering on behalf of my teacher. Young Warrior is very skilled in Kung Fu. You must be the best choice for the next sector leader's position. My teacher is just being kind. No way. My Senior Brother's Kung Fu is really good. In Chunyang Temple, no one can surpass him. The Chunyang Temple being our state religious sect, it is not surprising that they have so many talented individuals. I'll use this tea as wine. I wish you luck in winning the competition and becoming famous in the martial art's world. I will accept the auspicious words of Princess then. Young Warrior Xie, I have one question. Please, ask away. Since you've already unsheathed your sword, why didn't you kill? Teacher has always taught us, martial arts is used to help people and not for killing. It's getting late. Chongmao and Hero should rest early. I'll take my leave. Good night, Third Sister. Senior Brother, let's go back inside. All right, let's go. A few days ago, His Majesty gave me a basket of lychee. I've already given some of it to my nieces and nephews. I remember Crown Prince also liked it, so I've sent servants to bring it over. I've heard... Crown Prince was ambushed on your way back to the capital. Just treat this lychee as my way of calming down your nerves. Get lost! - Crown Prince, calm down. Calm down! Wu Sansi is openly riding above my head already. You still want me to calm down? Is he afraid that I don't know who tried to ambush me in the forest that he rushed here to send me gifts? Your Highness, please be careful with the words you say. This is my own palace! Why must I still be careful? He wants to piss me off! He just wants me dead! We still haven't completely eliminated the power of Wu Sansi that has encroached into the Eastern Palace (the place of the Crown Prince). If we don't endure it and be patient for now, it's easy to incite trouble. I saw Chongmao in the forest today. Him entering the capital at this time... Could it be that Imperial Father has thoughts of changing the heir to the throne? Based on the current situation, it shows that the return of Li Chongmao to the capital at this time, must have been planned by Wu Sansi. It is Wu Sansi again! He already cannot wait to publicly turn hostile on me. No, I cannot let him feel secured for having a strong backing. Chongmao must not be kept alive. Yes, I will do this immediately. Anything that will threaten my position, I must deal with it! Please, give me some money. - Senior Brother, that beggar is so pitiful.- You again! - I already told you, you beggar!- She's already asking for alms at this young age? Get lost now! Child, quickly get up. I mentioned that store to you before. It's really good. What's going on? Chongmao, do you have any money with you? Isn't that Tianci? Why is he crying? I used my money to buy this windmill. Tianci, what is the status of your mother's illness? My mother is lying down at home. Take this to buy nice food for your mother. Thank you, Older Sister. Be good. Stop crying. Jiangjiang. [Qiongxiao Treasures] Chongmao, let's go. Come, have a look. Candied fruit! This must be Your Highness, Prince Linzi. Yes, I am indeed Li Longji. This must be Chongmao, right? Chongmao greeting you, Third Brother. Chongmao, you stayed at Chunyang Temple for so long and indeed, you've acquired an aura of divinity. Your entire being has a sense of elegance beyond the norm. You have quite the graceful energy of Chunyang's Guru, Li Dongbin. Third Brother, you mustn't laugh at me. Third Brother. Third Sister, why have you changed into a woman's attire? Why not? I don't look good dressed as a woman? I'm used to seeing you dressed in men's clothes. Brother Xie, do I look pretty switched into a woman's robe? All right, Huawan. Don't play around and be a bother to Master Xie. Elder Disciple, what is going on outside? It's so festive. Please, take me outside. Please, Elder Disciple. Today's banquet is not only to receive Chongmao to chase away the journey toils, but it is also a place for me to express my gratitude to you. I'll take you to go eat something delicious. Okay, let's go. Chunyang Temple is our state temple that sends out talents. I look forward to seeing how you will lead Chunyang to assist our Tang of the Li Clan. To achieve fast, the reclamation of an era of peace and prosperity. Prince Linzi embraces the world in his care. I respect you. Come inside please, Master Lu. Though I grew up in Persia, I have been familiar with the culture of the central plains since I was young. The culture of China has a long history. With a build-up surpassing a thousand years, it absolutely has its areas to boast. That Lu Weilou truly knows how to set up camp. He's only been to Chang'An for a short while, but he's had many feasts with the powerful. He's even sent me a few invitations. I hear he's created a new sector called Sector Ming. He's currently summoning disciples to propagate his teaching. Use good to get rid of evil. Use light to shine on the past. Happiness, joy, sorrow and weary, they all return to dust. This is my first journey here in Chang'An, and I am still clumsy in my familiarity with things and people. May you all teach me a thing or two, for my sake. A sector motto of such... is actually not wrong. That is only his trick that he uses to blind people. Lu Weilou acquainting himself with the powerful is only to let his name be known widely. He's not holding the well-being of the people in mind at all. Okay, let's not talk about this. Let's drink. Sector Ming? This sword is renownedly named the Scarlet Sky. Legend says it was used by Liu Bang, Emperor Gaozu of Han, in the slaying of the serpent. It was your teacher, Li Dongbin, who gifted it to me. Scarlet Sky? Indeed, a great sword. We seem to share a great fate. Why don't I re-gift it to you? You mustn't. You are too gracious, Your Highness. I dare not accept this. Since that is what you say, I will not force you. I bid my farewell. Please forgive us for not staying. Let's leave now. How dare you! To come attacking a royalty! Go! Hurry! Older Brother Xie. Protect Chongmao. Disciple Elder! Older Brother Xie, are you okay? I'm fine. Older Brother Xie, let's go back. Halt. Older Brother Xie. Please, don't take to heart what happened today. It will pass after a night's rest. Don't let me worry you. Older Brother Xie! Don't forget the Crown Prince's birthday banquet in two days. Older Brother Xie, is this your first time killing a person? I know that you don't kill people randomly, but if you didn't kill her, others would have killed you. But she was not someone so evil that she could not be pardoned. It was me who was careless, to have killed her in a slip of hand. Don't you see this clearly still? Today's assassin came for Chongmao. But have you ever thought, it was perhaps she was forced to? She bought food for a young beggar, and it means she had a kind side to her. Perhaps she had a reason she was forced to do so. No matter what difficulty she was in, she was still an assassin who tried to kill Chongmao. Older Brother Xie, take a look. The little beggar outside the window? It's precisely because she was too feeble that she had the money she earned from begging snatched from her. If that beggar was Chongmao, what would you do? I could teach her martial arts to defend herself. You could teach that one person, but could you teach all the thousands, and ten thousands more little beggars? In this world that exists like the law of the jungle, if she is too weak, she will absolutely be bullied. You don't know how difficult it is to survive in royal families like ours. Chongmao just came back to Chang'An and there is already someone trying to kill him. The days from now on will just get more difficult. Today, you killing that assassin is actually helping Chongmao. It shouldn't have been like this. It shouldn't have been like this... Informing the sect leader, the assassin that were sent out have been killed. I heard that Xue Yunliu is the next in line to be the headmaster of Chunyang Temple. That's right. Chunyang is the state region of the Tang dynasty of the Li clan. If you want your Ming Sect to be able to get a strong foothold here in the central region, you must not belittle the strength of Chunyang Temple. Don't think I do not know what Huo Sang is planning. He chose not to appear and instead let you communicate with me because he wanted you to convince me in going against the Chunyang Temple. After we are done with our fighting, he will just pull up his net to harvest the benefits. You have misunderstood Huo Sang. Xie Yunliu is the greatest hindrance for any of us. If we don't eliminate him, it will be hard for the both of us to continue staying here in the central regions. In a few days, it will already be the Fame Sword Meeting. When that time comes, I want Xie Yunliu to know my power. Mu Sa, stop thinking that you are unrivaled. I can see that this Xie Yunliu has great sword skills. But you... If you lose in the Fame Sword meeting, let's see how you can continue staying here in the central plains. What? The distinguished Sacred Lady of the Red Clothing Sect actually is concerned with a person from the Ming Sect like me? It's really an honor. I'm only giving you advice out of good intentions. Xie Yunliu, I'm going to go meet you now. Third Brother, why are you here? You've already sent him home? Yes. Huawan, you only met him for several days. You better not fall for him. If he becomes the next headmaster of Chunyang and willingly serves me, it can help keep in balance the secret collusion of the Crown Prince with some warriors. If he is able to get the top price in the Fame Sword meeting, the whole Wulin (world of martial arts) will respect him highly. At this time, with Chunyang as our backer, all talented and heroes will be under my command. The revitalizing of the Li Tang Empire will then happen soon. I understand. I'll always remember the grand undertaking of Third Brother. I dare not delay it. Then it means that... you have never had any feelings for him? I never did. Huawan, ending this chaotic situation and stabilizing the empire is what it most urgent right now. Don't let romantic matters disturb your focus. Moreover, when we have successfully fulfilled our grand plan, when that Xie Yunliu learns that everything that we are doing now is because we are coveting the Chunyang power behind him, what do you think will he think? I understand. I want to rest now. Huawan, I am also just thinking for your sake. [Two days later] Young Warrior Xie, let me take care of your sword for now. Thank you. Don't know if Her Highness Princess... His Highness Prince Linzi and Her Highness Princess have already entered the palace today. I reckon that they are already on their way to the palace of the Crown Prince. You two will most likely see each other later. If His Highness is not around, how can a commoner like me be allowed to enter the palace? Young Warrior Xie, have you forgotten? You've achieved merit last time for saving the prince. Didn't His Highness Crown Prince personally give you an embroidered purse? That embroidered purse is way more useful than a government board. You can say that just with this embroidered purse, you can already walk around the whole Eastern Courtyard. You also already know about it. I will take my leave now. Young Lord Xie, this way please. Your Highness, Prince Linzi. Young Warrior Xie. How come I am not seeing Chongmao? After the assassination plot last time, Chongmao became scared. His Majesty ordered him to rest in his chambers and didn't allow him to attend tonight's gathering. Chongmao just got back here in Chang'An so he still isn't used to the life here. You still have to trouble Your Highness Prince Lin Zi and Your Lady Highness Princess to take care of him. Young Warrior Xie need not be this courteous. Chongmao is also my younger brother. Brother Xie, did you have a good sleep these past two days? Quite good. Let us enter the hall. Please. After you, please. Greetings, Your Highness Prince Linzi. Please. Your Highness Prince Linzi. - Your Highness Prince Linzi.- Brother Xie, do you find me cold and heartless? Huawan, actually— I have no way. Living in an environment like this, I cannot trust anyone. I must guard against everyone. Yesterday, you all were still laughing, chatting, and drinking happily inside one tent. Today, it's I kill you, you kill me. There is no family within the royal clan. You understand? - That's why— - Huawan, I understand what you said. I won't dwell on the reason why you are coming in contact with me. You also need not force me to accept your so-called reason. - But—- The Crown Prince has arrived. Everyone, rise. You all may sit down. I heard that Crown Prince almost got assassinated. My father was even worried about it. Looking at you now, you seem to be fine. When I go home, I must inform my father about it - so as to prevent him from worrying— - I heard that Huawan almost got assassinated again a few nights ago. Are you all right? Thank you for the concerns of Your Highness Crown Prince. I am fine. But it was Chongmao who got a bit frightened. Hence, today, he wasn't able to attend your party. Who among us siblings here didn't grow up in fear? Those assassins a few days ago don't mean a thing. Although that is the case, the Emperor now is an enlightened sage and the world is in peace. But within the capital and outside it, there are still some small disturbances. In my opinion, we still should seriously investigate these matters. Find who is really masterminding them that they would dare attempt to assassinate members of the royal family. It has always been me who managed the security of the capital. What Third Young Brother means is that you are blaming me for negligence then? I dare not. I just feel that these assassins are really so bold. They actually dared to attempt to kill a royal prince right under the feet of the Emperor. It's really so detestable. Moreover, Chongmao just entered the capital a few days ago and has already encountered an assassination attempt. Isn't that too coincidental? Third Younger Brother, what do you mean by this? I am just discussing the matter based on its merits. Your Highness. Attack! Let Xie Yunliu, come out to see me. Aren't you still going to hurry and go? Let's go. Let's go. Duke Wu of Liang is here! It's my birthday party. Duke of Liang actually dared to wear military armor and imposingly enter the palace. Aren't you being too bold? It is the birthday party of the Crown Prince, so how could I not dare to come? It's just that I didn't receive any invitation. I initially planned to just make a few bows outside the gates of the Eastern Palace and then leave. But who would have thought that the guarding Yulin Army (one of the imperial guards) is actually an old subordinate of mine and he insists to let me in. I still haven't had time to remove this armor of mine and I already got invited by him to come in. Since it is the birthday of His Highness Crown Prince, the presence of imperial uncle here is our blessing. Why don't I be the server today and pour you two some wine. Prince Linzi said earlier about investigating the assassination case against Chongmao. I also feel that we indeed should do so. Such a matter like that actually happening in the capital in broad daylight, is totally disregarding the laws of the empire. Yes. Since that is the case, then why don't we also investigate the assassination attempt on me in the forest outside the capital. Let's see who really is that bold that he dared to try to kill the crown prince of an empire. Whoever it is, he is not as bold as Your Highness Crown Prince. Choosing not to ride his carriage and instead insisting on riding a horse. Your Eminence Duke Liang wasn't at the scene that day. How come you know about this matter so clearly? Just basing it on your personality, you surely are courageous and unafraid of death. Of course, you would not ride a carriage. Thinking about it now, if something bad happens to Chongmao, the greatest benefactor should be Your Highness Crown Prince. Right? What did you say? Crown Prince surely knows very much what nonsense I am saying. Unruly! Wu Sansi! Don't forget, this world is under the surname Li and not Wu! There is an assassin that trespassed into the Eastern Palace! He sent words that he wants to see Xie Yunliu! Protect His Highness Crown Prince! Bother Xie! Let me go with you. It's fine. I am just going to meet him. Let me lend you my Scarlet Sky Sword. Thank you, Your Highness Prince Linzi. You sure have guts. To trespass on palace grounds. It's you. Xie Yunliu, they... seem like they are looking for you. Let's leave. I heard that the next clan chief of Chunyang Temple is attending the Fame Sword meeting. I'm here to test out your skills. How about I give you a free shot. If you win... No, if you can come equal to me, then I'll pull out from the Fame Sword meeting. I'll let you have that opportunity. How about it? That's a promise. Chunyang Sword Technique sure lives up to it's reputation. Xie Yunliu, we will meet again soon. Senior Brother, once the Fame Sword meeting is over just come and see me. All right? All right, I promise you. Have a safe journey, Brother Xie. Young Warrior Xie, hope you can win and obtain the precious sword. Thank you, Prince Linzi and Princess. Hope we can meet in the future. Royal courts are in turmoil. Jianghu* is in competition.(*community of martial artists) Xie Yunliu has no other choice but to get involved in this mess. The ups and downs of his life have just begun. Xiao Peng is next door. (Exchanging secret code for trade) Only use the small rod for fishing. (Exchanging secret code for trade) Trade the money and the goods at the same time.
