Here speaks a headless man. I could have topped myself in prison, though being Catholic, I decided to leave the killing to them. My crime: treason against the sovereign Maria the First, Queen of Portugal. Besides having my head chopped, I was also quartered. And my bits, scattered along the roads... left to rot. My violent death made me a martyr. The martyr of a failed revolt. And yet, there is a Brazilian holiday in my honour. Children learn about me at school. Others conspired against the Portuguese Crown, but only I was beheaded. Maybe because I was the poorest, or the most subversive... But the fact remains, mine was the only head that rolled. Portuguese Empire, Colony of Brazil. 18th Century. Stop where you are. Don't kill me, please! In the name of Maria I, Queen of Portugal, I arrest you for the crime of gold smuggling. - Januário, tie him up. - I know nothing about no gold. - I don't know what you're talking about. - Shut your mouth. Where's the gold, fuck it. Where's the lode? Hit him harder! You were asleep, man. You should have woken me. We could have made the arrest together. We're both in command. That one didn't last long. Manoel, what does it matter who did or didn't make the arrest? What does it matter? It matters a lot when promotion comes around. You think I cheated on you? If there's one thing I can't stand it's betrayal. You know what I think? I think you want the same as me: a promotion and precious stones. Dead right. That's exactly what I want. What's the meal today, Blackie? Stew. Darn itch... is driving me nuts. - Can't be lice again, can it? - Let's take a look. Hang on. Cut it out. That's filthy, Blackie! What if the bug flys into my stew? Then you'll have bug stew. Do that filth later. You will have a bunch of them. Disgusting slave. Got no manners. Any chance of improving the meal, Blackie? Have a word with Benedito. Don't give him, Blackie! Don't be giving him any. Little rat's gonna finish all our meal. - You can give him some! - Can I? Rations without work... - Just a little. - That's a life! Don't get used to it, Indian. Soon the place will be full of Indians looking for food. - Little rat. - There is no more. Later I'll bring some tea-tree oil for your head. I got something to tell you. Guess what that bastard told me. What? He says he's got no money so I'm gonna have to do some favours for the Administrator. That Benedito is one son of a bitch. Yeah. Aren't you gonna do anything? Benedito's my owner. My body belongs to him and there's nothing you can do about it. I'm up for promotion. With my first wage as lieutenant… Yeah, but until the promotion comes through? I have to keep obeying Benedito? And there's nothing you can do… I'll talk to him. I'll make an offer, I'll buy you. - An offer? - An offer. This miraculous hand! Already? And now that he's disturbed he's stinking like rot. He who? The Administrator. What's he disturbed about? Seems the tax inspectors have been around saying revenues are down. Revenues are down? This is the only checkpoint into or out of the minelands, how could the revenues be down? He says the gold is decreasing… The gold's decreasing? We nick smugglers every day in these woods. Decreasing... Well, with the lot he takes for himself… That explains things. Thief in uniform. Are you two still at this filth? Say, Joaquim, why don't you cut that hair? Finally, one truth this man said. Got to admit. Let's go, guys. Stop motherfucker! In the name of Maria I, Queen of Portugal, I hereby arrest you for the crime of gold smuggling. Get him! Get him! Spit it off! Where's the gold? Speak up, where is it? Is this the one? That's him. I'm gonna kill you! You're not killing anyone, shut up. Who's in charge here? I am. We both are. I need to have a word, sir. In private. Let him go. Let him go! Master, how dare this Portuguese talk to you like that? Easy. Arrest him. I'll check if you've got gold up your arse. - What was all that about? - That ignorant, wanted to bribe me with a fool's gold ring. Outrageous. Now you'll rot in prison! Just so he can learn how to bribe an officer of the Crown. They're digging their own graves. How's that? You see these books here... They're full of ideas that will bring us freedom. Freedom from the corrupt. Here are the ideas that set the North American colonies free. You're done, João. See if it's too high. No, it's good. You really think the corrupt administrators of this land are gonna want to be cut loose like the North American colonies? We'll see. Yeah, we will. Lets go, João. Oh, next time you come to the Vila, stop by for a chat. If the poet offers some liquor to smooth the tongue, it'll be my pleasure. Well, that's a deal then. Poet, be careful what you say. - They could have your neck cut for that. - Are you scared, João? I need to recruit all sorts to our cause. What's wrong? A damned toothache. Benedito, what's all this about Blackie having to service the Administrator? She's my slave and I'll do whatever I want with her. Sell her to me, go on. No. Think about it, Benedito. - I can offer you some... - Not even for a hundred gold coins. Let's have a look at that tooth. Will it hurt? No. Think about it. I can make you a good offer for Blackie. No. I need bigger pliers. Grab the rope and tie him down. Yes, it's gonna hurt! Sell me Blackie and buy another one. Hold him, João! Get out! Come with me. Yes, sir. - Close the gate. - Yes, sir. The whole lot. That too. Ah! There you are... I need to talk to you. A matter in your interests. The Checkpoint is closed for today! Did you talk to Benedito? Did you talk to Benedito? Won't he sell me? I promise you, Blackie. When I make lieutenant, I'll even take you on a trip to Lisbon. And what would I want to go to Lisbon for? It's full of Portuguese! Show some respect... I'm the son of Portuguese, that means I'm Portuguese too. He won't sell me, right? And you're gonna do nothing? Blackie, Blackie... I'm winning him round. You will be mine. Now just calm down and let me take care of it. Take care of nothing. I said stay calm. Easy for you to say, you've no idea how that Administrator stinks. I told you to calm down. I already have an owner! And it ain't you, Second Lieutenant. Turn around! A new look for a lieutenant. Not yet sleeping and already dreaming. Blackie, close the store! You cut your hair! You've been chosen for a mission into the Badlands. What? Yes…The Governor is sending you on a prospecting mission to the Badlands. The Badlands? The important thing is to find new gold fields. And if you do, you'll get your share. Can I take my men? I suggest you take Januário, I don't know what to do with that mestizo. - And Manoel? - I need him here. - Here where? - Here, fuck it! - Doing what? - What he always does. - Alone? - Yes, alone. Sir, I would urge caution with Manoel. What do you mean by that? A few days ago he tried to... extort a smuggler we apprehended... He would have let the guy go if he gave him the gold. It only didn't happen because I was there. I'll have one of my own stay on him. Who, sir? I don't know. Anyone who ain't black or mestizo. You leave tomorrow. Spread your legs! Hitch that skirt! Spread those legs. He was a soldier in my company and he's already lieutenant. Fernando de Vasconcelos, Antônio José de Araújo… lieutenant! And now Gusmão's grandson. Fuck off! You know better than me, sir. In these lands somebody's son, you're in, nobody's son, you're out. Now, imagine me, with this mixed race, sort of… sort of dusky-coloured. When am I ever gonna make second lieutenant? Never, sir. All that's left now is for Manoel to get promoted ahead of me. Easy. Take it easy. You telling me to take it easy just makes me even madder. Who knows, maybe after this mission you'll earn that promotion. You are coming with me, Januário! You'll come, we'll blaze a trail. We'll find lots of gold. No. I don't know. No, no, no. Into the Badlands? That's the wilds, sir. I'm not risking my life to stuff the Queen's ass of gold. No, no… - You're coming and that's an order! - No point in getting upset, sir. Isn't that, João? I'll fix you up with a horse. - A horse? - A horse. A mare. - A mare. - A horse. Blackie! It's Blackie! She stabbed Benedito to death! And run way! - What's going on, man? - Blackie has killed Benedito. Blackie! Where are you, Blackie? Where are you, damned? Blackie! Blackie! Where are you? You spent the whole night searching for her, sir? What's eating that girl, eh? You'll see, Januário. You'll see. I'm gonna find gold. Yes, I am! I'm gonna make lieutenant even if I have to buy the badge myself. Then I'll put together a whole squad to search these endless minelands until we find Blackie. Excuse me, Lieutenant. I'm here to load up the animals for the expedition into the Badlands. These are your troop. Matias has just arrived from Portugal and that other one's an Indian who knows the wilderness. Take gun powder with you. Second Lieutenant Joaquim. - Second Lieutenant... - Matias. Second Lieutenant Matias, do you know about stones? No. But an officer of the Crown will tell me all I need to know. Well... I know a lot more about stones than him, I'll fill you in on the way. - Let's get going? - Just a moment. This is our troop. This is Second Lieutenant Matias, who's just arrived from the Kingdom. There is my slave João. And Januário, my right hand. Most glorious Saint Onuphrius, I pray safe passage. Protect me from hunger, from thirst, from hardships and anguish. Grant me firmness and vigilance. That I might find thee in nature and all that surrounds me and return unharmed. In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. Amen. What's that? - What? - Cougar. What's a cougar? A cougar's a small jaguar. You get a lot of them around here. And what's a jaguar? A jaguar's an animal that eats people. Let's go, slowly. Stop here. Let's try some gold panning here? Throw out the cloudy water. Careful, you'll lose the lot. - More slowly? - More slowly. Swirl. Or you'll spill the load. Good, good, but you have to top up the water. Splash it in. Top up the water, like this. Replace the water. Keep washing the dirt. The smaller, lighter grit will float up top. The heavier stuff will sift to the bottom. That's it. The gold will be at the bottom. Indian. Indian? Hey! Indian. Where? Where? Is there? Is there? Stones. Stones? Gold! What is it? Joaquim, what's going on? Corpse of a runaway slave. Corpse of a slave? Yeah. There are lots of runaways in these parts. That's it. It's lighting. Give me some twigs. João. Are you awake, Master? Where were you? Went to bury the Malungo. - What, João? - The corpse of the slave, off the trail. He was from the Balanta tribe, like me. It doesn't kill, does it? There are blood-sucking insects that can suck a man dry. Really? Master. The river we have to cross is full of piranhas! João, don't joke about such things. - What are piranhas? - Fish that are drawn to blood. They attack and savage you to death. João, we don't have a bait ox, what are we gonna do? Bait ox, what's that? You bleed an ox, run it into the water so the shoal of piranhas goes for it, then you slip on across to the other side. Don't just stand there, Matias. Matias, fuck it! Do you have any idea of the danger? You put all our lives at risk. And then you have João go back across to fetch the horse… From now on, this troop takes orders from me and me alone. Matias... Check this one out, look. Let me see. Go get more stones. Man, go on! We're going to follow that mountain there. And head north. That'll take us in even deeper. That's what we're here for. Second Lieutenant, are you sure about this? I've got to find gold, Matias. Understand? I don't know about you. We keep going! The second lieutenant's busting his back to find gold, then most of it goes to your Queen anyways. But we keep a part, to share amongst ourselves. That's what an officer of the Crown told me. But I don't think there's anything here. Me neither. Bollocks! That's all I need. This place is a hellhole. You okay, Matias? No! No I'm not okay. This insane search is going to drive us all mad. Go back to Lisbon, where you should never have left in the first place. Yeah, Thank the Lord I have somewhere to go. Not like you, who doesn't even have that. You were born in this shithole. And this Inferno's where you'll die. But that's your problem. We all have our crosses, Matias. But this hellhole gives me everything I need. I don't have to go raiding other people's hellholes or sacking other people's wealth. Shit-poor fool! Fuck the lot of you! I finally understood a word the Portuguese said: - Fuck you. - Fuck the lot of you! I'd brought some rum for when we found gold. But I'm gonna open it now. To clear the air. - To your health, Second Lieutenant. - To us. That's got a kick. The only one who shouldn't be complaining about this trip is Matias. For someone fleeing Portugal, it's not so bad, is it? Where'd you hear that? Who told you that? They say Matias was messing with a married woman. Heard there's a law in Portugal. They say that... when a man fucks another's wife, and that other doesn't press charges but the scandal is discovered anyway, the fucker gets packed off to Angola, while the cuckold and the wife get sent over here, to Brazil. That explains why there're so many pacified cuckolds in this place. In your case, then, the husband didn't complain, did he, Matias? I demand respect. Don't mock your superiors. I'm practically Portuguese. I'm the son of a Portuguese. Son of a Portuguese. In this land everyone says he's the son of a Portuguese... What are you gonna do with the gold when we find it? First, I'm gonna get me a new uniform. Then I'm gonna bribe the lieutenant... to buy me the badge of second lieutenant. And you, Matias? Depends on how much we find. If it's a lot of gold. A lot, lots of gold... I'm gonna assemble a squad... to find Blackie. Portuguese... No, nothing for me. Master! Food! We're out of meat. Out of cereal too. And now this shit here... This molasses. It's gone off! It's time to turn back, Second Lieutenant. Januário. Look. Look. It's a bit. Look. It's just a bit. But you know better than me that it's a sign, man. We're close. Close to the vein. We're gonna find gold, Januário. We're nearly there. Let's go? When you're ready, sir. Second Lieutenant... Second Lieutenant! We're turning back to the Vila. I didn't order this. If you want, you can continue the expedition on your own. So this is a mutiny. Call it what you will. But Januário and me are turning back. Is that so, Januário? Yes, it is. Some men are coming. I dreamt of a bull last night. That means visitors. These are my two wives: Amália and Luiza. - Old lech! He's got two women under his roof. - You men sure walked some. - First expedition to make it out here. - We're looking for gold. We were. We were, but now we're heading back. If it's gold you're after, can't help you there. Farming is my business. Thank God for that. Gold…Gold ruins everything. First the land, then the men. So how's my girl? Hurting? Master, the healing gum. Twice a day you put this balm. Baccharis, mint and ashes. A dentist in my home. That's Divine providence. Rest for a week. No chewing, okay? How can I pay you? You can pay me in gold. Lanzudo, that stone you found in the stream, give it to the man. Lanzudo? Lanzudo! Wake up! What's up? Your master says you've to show me where you found this stone. This way. Is it far? No, just over there. Joaquim! This way. Only 700 arrobas arrived. We have to investigate this. So? What do they look like to you? I think they are valuable, but I need more time. You will have your time. Are there many like these? A great many, Your Excellency. Do you know where to find them? The exact spot. Tell me something. Did you find them alone? Alone, sir. Very well, inform the lieutenant of the precise location and await further orders. You may go. You're dismissed. Second Lieutenant... Where's Matias? Matias left for Rio de Janeiro like a scared chicken... Infamous Portuguese. The guy had no guts. Say… New shirt, Januário. Tricorn... João, your slave, went to see his wife, Maria. I have news from the Checkpoint. They say the Administrator's left for Rio de Janeiro. He's gonna work for the viceroy now. A rich thief gets promoted... - a poor thief gets punished. - That's how it goes, is it? And Manoel's made lieutenant. He's in charge there now. He's requested me to work for him. But you're not going, right? You're with me. I'm gonna put together a squad to look for Blackie - and you're coming with me. - No, sir. He's requested me and I'm going. You're going to abandon me, Januário. - Again. - Again? You betrayed me with Matias on the expedition and now you're gonna betray me again. Is that right, Januário? You don't need anyone anymore, do you, Second Lieutenant? - What's that supposed to mean? - Had an audience with the Governor, didn't you? Man of your word. The lieutenant told me about the stones. - What stones, Januário? - Who's the traitor here, eh? Well. This is certainly different to your library. As I see it, Poet, in these lands there are three kinds of people: bandits, corrupts and lazybones. And you? In which category do you belong? All three. That's the Portuguese talking. That's what they want us to believe. To make it look like they're not to blame for the misery here. Look, you mark my words. The worst bandits, corrupts and lazybones here are the Portuguese. They want us to believe what you said. This nonsense. Is that you, Joaquim? I assessed those stones and they don't warrant further exploration. Stay here in the Vila. We'll call you when there's a new mission. And these stones you found out in the Badlands… Citrus tea. What if they're valuable and they're trying to deceive you? I can't take that idea out of my mind. - Merci beaucoup, Mor. - Da rien, monsieur. So what are you going to do now? I'm going after the stones by myself. Have you read all these? That's what books are for. Where's the rest of the troop? How many are there, which direction are they headed? Speak, you son of a bitch, or you're a dead man! Blackie... Blackie. Black is a colour. My name is Zua. Speak: where's the troop? There is no troop. There is none. Tell them, I'm not with a troop. We're going to kill you. Talk now. Talk. Kill me. Kill me. Kill me now. Do it, please. Kill me. Those who have quilombola blood... will not fall. This will only end when we gain our freedom. We are warriors of faith. We are the warriors of the quilombola people. We are quilombola warriors. Don't ask me why I'm doing this. Now get out of here, and tell no-one about our Quilombo. If you touch me, I'll kill you. No white man's ever going to lay a hand on me again. Now get off, before I cut your head off, scum! I was on my way to Caetés when they jumped me. There were too many of them. They duffed me up, took my weapons, my boots, my saddle. Then they let me go. Who were they? I don't know, sir. Bandits, I suppose. This has to end. They're robbing all our wealth. These well dressed purse-snatchers. Surrounded by this filthy court. Dripping with diamonds. Robbing all our wealth. And no-one wants to hear of liberty. This rotten court just wants to own the others. This has to end. This has to end. Good morning, Master. Oh, João. Are you hungover? I stopped drinking for a few days, it wasn't doing me no good. But are you okay? Yeah, yeah. - And Maria? - She's fine. - Your daughters? - They're fine too, thank the lord our God. I wanted to talk to you about Maria. Maria put some money together… What's this, João? It's not much. But it's enough to buy my freedom. You can't leave me now. After all these years by my side. My daughters are growing up. My wife needs me. I have to look after my family, master. Please. Second Lieutenant, Master... could you sell me to my wife? It's your right, man. It's your right. Tell Maria to stop by and sort out the formalities. - I'm committed to this. - We need this. You joining our struggle is very important. Father. This is our man. The second lieutenant I told you about. So it's you, my son. You wish to join our fight? Oh, Father! My brains are boiling. The books the poet's given me are keeping me awake at night. My revolt only grows. I have the will and the need to do something about it. I know. I keep thinking how life must be in North America. A place where all men have the same rights and each has his own dignity. All men are treated equally. I imagine that they don't even have guns, or armies. Up there, no-one needs to pander to anyone. What counts is a man's character, not his possessions. And I also think, Father... that it must be a place that will never use force to dominate other nations. - They'll never want to colonise other lands. - You think so, my son? There, too, there are men and sinners. Father, I must act upon my rage. You speak with determination. Every three years a new Governor arrives and takes everything that's ours back to the Crown. Everything. And we wait for the new one to arrive and bleed us dry all over again. - No-one can do anything alone. - No-one can do anything alone. The only way up is join together. No point in trying alone, you can't solve this problem alone with no power, right? - What's in it for us? - Everything. Everything. The Crown comes over here and sucks our blood. They'll be taking our hens away next. Leaving us here with hen's feet to eat. I make my living. I earn enough... so that's alright. But they're stealing our wealth. They're taking our gold. What's that got to do with me? I'm not getting any anyway. It's that kind of thinking that gets us nowhere. We're shrinking. - In a land of riches like this. - What'll happen is we'll be hounded, persecuted. At least like this we're free. You're not free, man. You don't know what you're saying. You're not free. If there's one thing you're not, it's free. Pour me a rum, will you? A shot to relax. It's a sight to behold, Poet... the glimmer in those folks' eyes. Learning ideas they'd never heard before. Seeing all those possibilities... Your work is very important, Second Lieutenant. I spoke to some fifty families or more, Poet. That's the way. You know the new Governor is arriving... Who, Poet? The new Governor. He wants to meet everyone of note upon arrival. Are you going? Of course. Another thief arriving in and we do nothing. A great revolt could begin with a great assassination, Poet. What if I kill the Governor? Are you mad? Conspiracy is done under the cloak of night, in hushed conversations. You read the same books than I, didn't you? They don't talk about chit-chat... and secrets. They talk about insurrections, bloodbaths. That's what I saw at the Quilombo. A real revolt. You will do nothing. I forbid you. You know what will happen? You'll expose all of us. Open your eyes! Joaquim, pay attention. It's time for you to meet the men who, like me, want to free this Colony. Local noblemen. The mines are scarce, Father, and taxes keep rising. This is our man. Be welcome, Second Lieutenant... God bless you. The second lieutenant has understood and is committed to our ideals and I believe he could be most useful in divulging them. I doubt there's a man alive who wants to see this land free more badly than I. Now with weapons and men. If we attack, we can kick those bloodsucking sons-of-bitches in the arse.
