And eighl, seven, six-- pick up your knees! Five, four, three! Higher! There’s a man in suburban Chicago who says he has a talking dog. Reporter Bryan Upberg has this look. Eat up. Come on. Good girl. You know... tomorrow's Friday. Cassie, did you remember to get the Freezon at the market? | put it in the bathroom. Can't seem to get rid of these warts on my back. They just won't stay gone. She’s kind of the office mascot. Everyone here’s golten accuslomed to her. Hey, you're getting grease all on your face. So what's it to you? It takes a fine-tuned, accustomed ear to pick up on what she’s saying. Okay, you've been through some trouble, yes? You've made a mistake or two that you have come to regret. So who hasn't, right? Now, what you need to do, in my opinion, is you need to make a list of all of your best assets, hmm? Okay? Okay. I'll try it. All right, folks, let's call it a night. Thanks very much. - Adios, Bob. - See y'all tomorrow. - Roger, you go straight home now. - Yeah, | will. Hey, Cassie, | want you here on time from now on. Get yourself here 15 minutes early tomorrow if you expect a whole paycheck on Friday. Oh, now, Mr. Fry, can't you be sweet? No, | can't. With a reputation like that ingrate's got in this town, she's lucky to have any job at all. Hey, you want to know what else you could do to help this mood you've been in? What? Tell me. Well, try that new Orange Marmalade nail polish that's just come in at the Rexall. Triple-coat your fingernails and toes, and when you get to feeling low, all you've got to do is just glance down at your hands and your feet, and it'll give you a little lift right there on the spot. Fingernails and toes. The next thing to do is to concentrate on some sort of interesting hobby. Let me see now-- for instance, | make those big, decorative pillows. Oh, those are real nice. The most important thing is to meet new people and to get out on all the social occasions that come your way. Tomorrow, Frank is taking me to see that outdoor Shakespearean play at Red Rock Canyon. You can come with us. Oh, gosh, | don't know. I think I'd feel kind of like a third wheel. Hey, let me tell you something about Frank and me. We have been dating three months now, and already | realize we are literally made for one another, like coffee and tea, sugar and cream. Now, when you're made for one another, you don't mind asking other friends to join you. Look, we'll pick you up around 7:30, okay? It'll give you a chance to dress up. Point. Gotta shift it there. Okay. Down with the topmast! Lower! Lower! Lower! Bring her to dry with the main course! A plague upon this howling! A plague! We'll all be drownded! If thou more murmurest, | will rend an oak and peg thy heart in its knotty entrails till thou hast howled away twelve winters. Pardon, master, | will be correspondent to command and do my spiriting gently. Do so, and after two days' time, | would discharge thee. That's my noble master. What shall | do? Say what, what shall | do? Go make thee like a nymph o' the sea, subject to no sight but thine and mine, invisible to every eyeball else. Go take this shape and come hither in it. Go hence with diligence. | loved how that fairy was sparkling way up in the air. Oh, and how her toes stayed perfectly pointed when she went up. Yes, and those golden lights were so beautiful all around her. Hey, where's your thermos? | don't know. Back there, | guess. Well, look, you go get your thermos. We'll go on to the parking lot and get the car. Okay. I'll be real fast. I'll hurry. Now my charms are all overthrown, and what strength | have's mine own, which is most faint. Most faint. Hi. Hi. Lose something? Yes, | lost my thermos. | was sitting right here. Is that it? Yes. That's it. - Thanks a lot. - You're welcome. Hey, you need a lift? Oh, no, | have some friends. They're out there waiting for me. Out there in the parking lot, they're waiting. Okay. Bye-bye. Thanks. Let's go on in and get a little breakfast, if you girls don't mind. What a good idea. I love their egg rolls. Frank, you have such good ideas. | think I'm gonna go on home. What? No. Oh, don't you want to come inside for just a little while? | don't think they want to see me in there, for breakfast or otherwise. Yeah, okay. Well, good night. Okay. Okay, good night. Thanks for taking me to the show. Sure. 'Night, Frank. 'Night, Pat. Come on, eal your eggs. 1 feel kinda stupid about it. We'll spiit it 50/50. There we go. - | want you to make a wish. - Okay. I'll make one. - Come on, make a wish. - | don't want to make a wish. Think of something that you've always wanted. Okay, | wish you'd tell me what you want to tell me. - What are you so excited about? - I'm gonna have a baby. Yeah? | guess we're not gonna have time to get together that beautiful church wedding where | wear the blue veils. Well... God. Yeah, well, feel kinda stupid about it. We always said how we wanted a house full of kids. Might as well get started now, huh? Go eat your eggs there, Stool. - They're gonna get cold in a minute. - | have to get married pretty fast. Salt? It's already been almost four months. God. Yeah, well, tell you the truth, Stoolie-- oh, God, you're gonna hate me for this-- | mean, this is no reflection on you, but | just don't feel ready to cash in my chips. - Your chips? - Yeah. For now. Well, what about having the baby? Now, look, it's gonna be okay. I'll help to pay to get it all taken care of. We'll split it 50/50, right down the line. | don't understand. | thought we were gonna get married. Stool, look, don't. You told me you love little babies. You told me you love my meat potpies! Now you're telling me you want to split 50/50 and you don't feel ready to cash in your chips? - Stoolie, settle down! - Well, it's too late! Your chips are cashed! I'm sorry, they're cashed! Stoolie, people are staring at us. Don't pop your cork. Come on. Eat your goddamn eggs. You eat the goddamn eggs, you son of a bitch! My God! What the hell are you doing? I'll kill you! I'll kill you! I'll kill you! Hi. - Hi. - How you doing? I-I liked that show out at Red Rock Canyon. Good. It was beautiful. Well, here. - An acting workshop. - And it's free. Well, I'm gonna go have some lunch. | had lunch already. Tuna fish, lettuce, crackers. It was very good. Well, wasn't gonna ask you to lunch, but how about some dessert? I've got a frozen key lime pie we could thaw out. It's good, if you like key lime pie. - Well, | like key lime pie. - Yeah? But | have to visit my cousin. She's over at Skull Valley State Hospital. Cassie! That's my mother. She's picking me up. I'm coming! Yeah, well, okay. - Thank you... - Sure. ...for this notice. Now, according to Madge, dear old Napey was downstairs feeding his cat BoBo when he started hearing the upstairs toilet flushing over and over again for about one-half hour straight. Well, finally he gets up and he goes to see just what's happening, and what do you think he finds? That poor girl sending every stitch of her underwear straight down the pipes, even down to the hand-embroidered set that Bingo gave her for high school graduation. But it wasn't till suppertime that evening that Napey finally realized what deep trouble that girl was in. There she was, sitting at the dining table in the stark nude with this thick, awful makeup spread all over her face. According to Madge, it was absolutely grotesque. Anyway, what do you think she serves up for his supper? There sits on the table a plate of sanitary napkins and a bottle of ketchup, and she says, "If you don't like this, there's another dish in the kitchen." And as if this wasn't enough, he goes to the kitchen, and what do you think he finds there but his treasured cat BoBo cooked to a crisp in the oven. And you know how Napey always loved and adored BoBo. Poor BoBo. And besides that, Madge says it was an absolute fire hazard. Anyway, give this to Linda when you see her. And act natural. Hi, Linda. Here's a present Mama bought for you. Thank you, Cassie. Are you doing okay? | sort of had this spell. Yeah, | heard. You ever feel like that? | think so. Does it go away? It has to. Think they'll fit? Oh, me. Oh, me. Hey, just forget about these. You just tell me what you want. I'll get you anything you want. Well... I'd like some bend-straws. | think I could use 'em. Hey, that's not your bike. It is now. Hi, my name is Kirk Stevens. You may recognize me. | played Prospero in our first show, The Tempeslt, and then I'm on to the challenging roles of Bottom and King Lear. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. So, future thespians, | think what I'd like to do now is find out who you are and why you're taking this dramatic workshop. Why don't we start with you? Stop! Hold it! Okay, we're gonna try it again, all right? My name's Shirley Kilpatrick. I'm the barmaid at the Cactus Pool Hall. And | watch a lot of acting on TV, and | just thought I'd like to give it a try. Excellent. That was excellent, Shirley. Very good. Great. Um... how about you next? Well, my name is Hank Moss. I'm the electrician here in Buckeye Basin, and | met Carol there at the Elk Lounge. We had a few drinks, and she was telling me how you had to teach this free class or you might not get your grant money. She was afraid nobody'd show up. | told her not to worry, that I'd find the time to come in and lend a hand. Thanks, Hank. Yeah. Well, besides the grant money from the Wayne Buckeye Society, we all feel that these classes have an immeasurable amount to offer, but no bullshit here. - Okay. - Okay? Yeah. Okay. How about you next? My name is Cassie Stoolie. I'm a waitress at the Elk Lounge, and how | came to come here is, well, watching that show out at Red Rock Canyon, that Shakespeare show, it got me thinking how good it would be to be totally different from me. Even if it was for an hour, or a half hour, or a few minutes' time. Hi. Hi. How's class? Fine. Good. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Hi, Mama. | got your nerve pills. Oh, well, finally. | went out and joined that acting workshop out at Red Rock Canyon. | wasn't too bad for my first day. | don't know why you want to spend your time on something like that. You know, Bea Jones is teaching a class in adult stenography over at the high school. Now, there's something to fall back on. Yeah, don't get your hopes up or nothing, 'cause after what you did to Billy down to the Canton Cafe, no one's gonna think of you as a glamorous movie queen. Who says they're supposed to? Yeah, don't get your hopes up or nothing, ‘cause after what you did to Billy down...Billy down... Billy! Billy, I'm sorry! Billy! Billy, God! Oh, God! Oh, God, I'm sorry! Get away from him, you little wildcat! You've done damage enough. Come on, let's go. Get out. Let go of me! Stay out! Wretched, wretched, horrible mistake. Broken. It's all broken. That's right. Idiot! He doesn't even love you. He doesn't even... Okay, okay. This is it. This is it. | know. All right, then, all right. Okay, let's see if you can take this! Well... Okay. That's right. All right, all of you. I'll show all of you. Okay... | don't have to take this, not me. No way. At midnight, I'll jump. Just a little jump. All right, | never liked this skinny neck anyway. What's left? Yeah. Let's break it in two. Now. Now! Who's out there? What's going on? It's all right, Mrs. Verber. It's just me, Cassie Stoolie. - Who? - Cassie Stoolie. It's just me. It's just me. That's good, Jane. | really like your commitment. But remember what | said-- it doesn't have to be an animal, okay? Okay, you next. That's good, Winston, that's good. That's good, but hey, hey, very convincing feline. Guys! Guys, listen up. This time | don't want an animal. | just want an emotion, an abstract feeling, okay? You next. That's scary. Nice song. Still working on it. - Brand-new "C" harp. - Gosh. Wanna try it? Okay. - No. - Go ahead, try it. No, that's all right. | gotta go. Nice harp, though. - Thank you for letting me hold it. - Sure. | don't know, Pat. He just keeps looking at me, staring at me with those eyes. How do you mean, exactly? Well, it's hard to explain, see, because he doesn't say a lot. It's just the way he's around all the time. But that is where the guy works. | mean, he's supposed to be there. Yeah. Tell me, does he ever come up and ask for a date or your phone number or anything? Oh... well...no. See, then? | don't think he's interested. You think? Well, that's good. I'm on my own now. That's how | like it. That's how it has to be. Okay, Cassie. But this Riley guy certainly is on your mind. No, he's not. For heaven's sakes, he'll be going back to Los Angeles as soon as the festival is over. Let's just forget the whole thing, okay? Okay. Well, hopefully we'll have two dozen of those tract homes up there by next summer. We've already got bids on six of 'em. Sounds good. - Hi, Cass. - Mr. Fry. Hi. | heard you were working here. Yeah. Want a refill? Sure. Thanks. | just stopped by to see how you're doing. - You okay? - Yeah, I'm doing great. Look here. My nails are all polished. Why, your hands are shaking. They aren't. Okay. You're looking real good. | gotta work. I'm working now. What's he doing in here? | don't know. - Oh, you're shaking. - | know! Okay, now, look, Cassie... you have got to rip that Billy Downs right out of your heart. Now, let go of him. Let go of all of it. Otherwise, it's just gonna eat you up alive, | swear. Thanks for the coffee, Cass. I'll be seeing you around. Damn it, Cassie, are you listening to me? Yeah. Okay. Yeah. - | love you. - Love you, too. Ralphy, put Elvis back in the tank. Oh, Mom. Don't "Mom" me. Cassie! They're gonna be married by the time we get there. All right, I'm coming. It's just...this hat won't fit. Put it on one station and leave it there. Hey! All right, now, right into the camera. And.. cheese. Cheese! - And cheese. - Cheese! Oh, that's beautiful. Now let's get ready for the processional. Here we go. Let's turn around here. Children, right in here. Dad is where he needs to be. Here she comes. Gosh, | think it's so romantic, Stuart Andrews marrying Alice Whitey even though he knows her and certain members of her family are classified to be certifiable albinos. Isn't she cute? And they say she can hardly see with those pink little eyes of hers. Has to count her way down the aisle. It takes her 24 steps. He's here. - Who? - Him. To the bride and groom! To the bride and groom! Hear, hear! Go around. Go around. What? God, you're soaking wet. Come in, come in. | just made some coffee. It's hot. | didn't come here for coffee. Okay. I'll get you a towel. Here. | came here because | have something to tell you. What? I'm through with all involvements, see? Okay. | have a blemished past. People say my personality's strange. | carry a whiskey bottle in my handbag and | paint my fingernails layer after layer to try to help, but, you see, it doesn't help. | just can't see... Here, here's your towel. Thank you. - See? - What? That's what I'm saying. That's what I'm talking about. Stop looking at me with those eyes! Stop looking at me with those damn eyes! Why'd | do that? | need a drink. Stop. "Priscilla Lee Jones, "daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Rowland Jones i, was wed in holy matrimony to William Ray Downs." William Ray Downs? | guess he made up that name "Ray." He didn't have a middle name. Why don't you try one of these butter cookies? You used to say they were your favorite. | guess he made up that name "Ray." You used to say they were your favorite. - Butter cookies. - He didn’t have a middle name. - Cookies. - Middle name. You used lo say they were your favorite. - Strangulation. - Butter cookies. Strangulation. Definitely no. Too risky. A shot in my head. Possible. Gun required. Okay. Stabbing. No, too messy. Death by drowning. Possible, if large body of water could be found. Burning. No. Definitely no. Poison. Possible, if poison could be found. Let me see-- shot in the head... death by drowning... poison. Yeah. A spoonful. A big spoonful. Candies?! Candies?! Damn! Fish bones. Dynamite. We had fish for dinner. Get on back to bed now! The angels won't be coming for you tonight. Come, night, come, loving, black-browed night, give me my Romeo. And when he shall die, take him and cut him out in little stars, and he will make the face of heaven so fine-- Cassie, wait, wait. Stop. Hold it. Relax. Relax. You're way too tense, you're way too cautious. Hey, guys, do you mind? I'm working. We're working out the fight scene. Now, stop holding back. | know, it's horrible. Remember, you are playing Juliet, a woman of earth-shattering courage. You're breaking your heart wide open so that all of your violent desires and fragile fears are laid out recklessly for life or your lover to do with what they will. You are begging and praying for love... for life. Right. Gee, ... gosh, I... | don't know, Kirk. Look, Cassie, If you're not gonna risk more of yourself, don't bother. Dare to be heroic. Heroic? | never even met anyone that was heroic. Then imagine, invent, pretend, believe. Find the heroism. It's there in Juliet, it's there in you. Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds, towards Phoebus' lodging. Such a waggoner as Phaeton would whip you to the west and bring in cloudy-- - Hi. - Hi. - | been thinking. - About what? About you. Look, I'm sorry | bothered you last night. Just try and don't-- | wish you'd just... erase it, okay? Erase it. Wanna go for a drive with me? If you have something to say, say it now, all right? Okay. Well.. what? | think you ought to go for a drive with me. My car's over there. It's the ugly brown one. Can | take these off now? Okay. Okay, uh, let's talk about me. You know, when | was three years old, | strangled a white kitten to death with my bare hands. At nine years old, | cracked open my favorite girlfriend's skull with a steel pipe. Wham! She was out like a light. At 13, | listened to my mother's employer, Mrs. Bessel, choke to death while | was screwing her live-in nurse on the bathroom floor. At 19, | was a certifiable dope dealer and my best customer. - God damn! Stop! - It's okay, it's okay. | got it. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay. Cuttin' around. Okay, here we go. You okay? - Yes. - Okay. | also did a stint in county jail for breaking windows and throwing all my belongings out of a burning building that in fact proved to be... well, not burning. Then later things got better. | met some people. They were good to me. They helped me out. | work now. | don't throw things out windows, and | don't screw nurses on linoleum floors anymore. Look, uh, I'd like-- I'd like-- What I'm trying to say here is... you want to go out with me? What? God, | don't know. You don't know? Look, I've done a lot worse things than you will ever do. - You have? - Yeah. Oh. All right, then. All right, then. No. Unfortunately, Winston, we're not going to have time for all of your monologues for the Buckeye Day entertainment event. In fact, it's going to be really tough for me to pick the top four performers in the class. Well, I'd just like to state that | have performed at the Courthouse Auditorium once before. - | know all about the acoustics. - Can't get it off. Well, thank you, Jane. I'm just gonna file that away. Where do we sign up if we want to be considered? Cassie, they've just got to pick us. | mean, we're the only star material they've got in this class. - You think so? - Sure, absolutely. And this could be our one big chance to be discovered! Well, if you're not gonna let me help you, just forget it. Great. Some pal, some friend. You've hated me since June. Admit it! Okay, | admit it! What is that? What is that? It's a saw. That's a chainsaw, man, that's a chainsaw! - | know. - Do you know what | am? - I am an actor! - | know that. Do you know what this is? This is a very expensive prop. Don't lose your head. You don't use a chainsaw on either of them! So this jerky cousin of mine, Robaire-- that was this kid's name, Robaire-- he told me when | lived with him on this farm one summer, he said that if you bury chicken bones in the backyard, they'll grow up to be skeletons that like to pick out your eyeballs with their fingers. - With their fingers? - Well, with their claws. Only, get this, they only like blue eyes. Well, Robaire and his whole stupid family had brown eyes, thank you very much, and every time we're having chicken, Robaire's running out in the backyard and he's burying all the goddamn bones. I'm a nervous wreck all summer long. Brother. Yeah. You know, the whole summer that | was stuck there, I'd wear a dishrag tied around my eyeballs every night before I'd go to bed. Yet still, when | heard that Robaire fell out an open window a couple of years back, | felt pretty bad. So Robaire died? Oh, no, but he could have. Do you know many of these dead people? Yeah, some. My Grandma Willie and her second husband Louis are buried right over here. Hi, Louis. Over here is where my daddy died. Wilford Pile Stoolie. Mama left these fake lilies on his grave. Your dad's dead, huh? Yeah. He died back when | was 14. Did you like him? Well, sure. He was a manager in the copper mines till they closed them all down. After that, there was some troubled times. He started going down to Mexico to drink tequila, and he'd gamble and carouse with strange women. He'd come back, though, and bring us toys. One toy was a monkey that played the cymbals. - Pickles? - Thank you. Then this one time... he comes back real sick and drunk, and come to find that the dye from one of his black silk socks had gotten into a cut in his ankle and given him gangrene poisoning. It was those silk socks that killed him. No shit. Yeah. | saw a picture of my dad once in a newspaper. It was not very attractive. What do you mean? Well, you know, they had him in shackles and shit. He was trying to hide his eyes behind this paperback novel, you know. He had the most ridiculous expression on his face. Gosh. Then you never even knew your dad, huh? No, | guess not. So, does everybody in this burg have their picnics in the graveyard? | guess so. My family always did. So tomorrow I'll be back from my Aunt Bingo's and Uncle Bud's no later than 5:00, okay? Okay. I'll pick you up. They really won't mind if | watch the show from backstage? Nah, they won't mind. Just wear something black, okay? Something black. Okay. Hi, Uncle Napey. Oh, he's asleep. How are you? Looks just like a baby, doesn't he? Hi, everybody. Look at you! Oh, welcome, baby sister! How you like the new house? | love the bow. | just love the bow. Don't you just love this maintenance-free yard? What a luxury, huh? Well, | love the bow. | just love that bow. Thanks. Well, good Lord, child, you sure are growing into a big boy. Cassie, there's someone here been waitin' to see you all morning. ...I've been better, that's for sure. That suit she's wearing is something else. It's what they call a TV-watchin' suit. It's for watchin' TV. Oh, she's takin' some medication, makin' her kinda balky. Linda. Are you okay? Yes. Oh, yes. I'm watching TV. That's why they got me wearing this suit. I'm watching TV. So, how are things with you? Fine. Well, who's your boyfriend now? | don't have one. Oh, I'm so glad you're not going out with that Billy Downs anymore. Honestly, | don't know why everybody in Buckeye Basin kept making over him just 'cause he could throw a dumb old baseball. He was awfully conceited. Well, he was insecure about a lot of things, but there were some good qualities that he had. Well, that is very generous of you, Cassie. And after him leaving you to marry that simpy Prissy Lee, just 'cause her daddy's Mr. Moneybags. | admire your courage so much. It just makes me want to cry. | mean, thinking of your baby's welfare like you did. | just don't know if | could have been that brave. Linda. Linda, it's me, Cassie. Cassie. God, are you gonna be okay? - I'm okay. - Good. Look here, your pom-poms are all messed up. Let me fix 'em for you. It's gettin' so long, your hair. | miss her, Linda, | do. Your baby? You miss her? Yeah. Why'd | give her away like that? God. If only he hadn't left us. | never forget about it. And I...| can't let go! You understand? | can't! You can't? Can't? Billy! God! Cassie! I'm sorry. | had to come here. | haven't gotten anything straightened out. It's all blurry and gray and purple. Cassie, this isn't the time. | know. You're cooking steaks. I am. I'm sorry. My in-laws are over. Oh. Yes. Four T-bone steaks. Four T-bone steaks for supper. Cassie... I'm really sorry you're so upset, | really am. Wish there was something | could do. Billy, Daddy wants his steak more rare than medium rare, so don't burn it. I'm gonna bring out some extra barbecue sauce. Cass... I wish | could ask you to stay. It's okay. I've already eaten. Yes, | had fried chicken, potato salad, coleslaw, cakes, and pies. It was a feast! An incredible feast. Believe me, | couldn't eat another bite. Over here. So she was really riding in a pink-and-white carriage? | already told it once. And chewing on a blue dog? That baby had spit all over that nasty blue thing. Well, at least they give her toys. You gotta give a baby toys. It helps occupy their minds. Yeah. God. | don't believe | ever... | didn't care, though. | just felt so full of nothing, | wanted myself dead. Dead's dead. You forget about dead. That baby's gonna be doing just fine. Hey, Hood, the bottom special! Hit the bottom special! Oh, right. Kirk, you old jackass. Jesus Christ, man, that's the third cue you've blown. What the hell's wrong? - Lighten up, Nicholas. - You got to get it together. Hi. Oh, hi. | just came by for the show. | was just gonna see it. | know you're real busy right now. | know | was supposed to meet you earlier. It's okay, it's okay. Hey, Nicholas, Nicholas, cue 25. - All right. - Yeah. There was some sort of a mix-up. I'm sorry | forgot to meet you. | just did. It's okay. Doesn't matter. - Nicholas, cue 26. Come on. - Oh, shit, okay. Yeah. Look, if it's okay, maybe I'll see you after the show. - Are you gonna stay for the show? - Yeah, I'm gonna stay. Okay, do you want to watch it from up here? - Okay. - Come on, come on. ...Pyramus presented in their sport... Okay, sit right here. ...entered in a brake, when | did him at this advantage take. An ass' nole | fixed on his head. If we shadows have offended, think but this, and all is mended-- that you have but slumbered here while these visions did appear. Okay, now, bring this lever back very, very slowly... - Gentles, do not reprehend... - ...until you hear it click, then stop. ...we will mend. That's it. There you go. It clicked. Okay, now, bring this one up very, very slowly. - ...we will make amends 'ere long. - That's it. Little faster. - Great. - Look at that! Hey, Nick, look at that! | made all those people appear! That's really great, Cass. Really good. So, do you have to go straight home? Um...no. | guess not. No. Okay. Good. Chili sure was good. Good. You'll have to give me the recipe sometime. Al right. I'd better be going. It's getting late. | really enjoyed it. Wanna smoke? No, | don't smoke. All right, I'll have a smoke. - | like this cigarette. - You do, huh? Yeah. It feels strange in my hand, though. Why is that? | don't know. | gotta go. Don't go. Stay with me. Stay with me tonight. Al right. You remind me of a pair of green mittens | had once. 1 do? What happened to ‘em? To the mittens? | don't know. | don't remember. I got it! They picked me! They picked me! They picked me for the Buckeye Day Entertainment Event! - That's great! - | gotta do a speech and everything! Well, let's go celebrate. - Yeah. - Come on. Yeah. Come on. Anyway, Hank is having to do his Wayne Buckeye Shakespearean riddles in front of the courthouse, 'cause it ended up they could only pick three of us for the actual entertainment event. Winston, he's gonna do Macbeth, Jane, she's doing one of her own comedy sketches. - Yeah. - You know, she's funny. And me, | get to do Juliet-- a speech of Juliet's. Our Shakespearean speeches are supposed to be real dramatic. The other ones are more funny. That's why Kirk picked 'em-- contrast. Sounds like Kirk's got all the angles covered. - Yeah, I'm excited about it. - I am too. lam. Riley, this is the best day of my whole life. | wish it would never stop. Maybe it won't. Maybe. Goodbye, you guys. We'll see you later. Bye. - Well, tomorrow's the big day. - Yeah. - Knock 'em dead. - I'll try. Cassie. - B|IIy Hi. Just getting some tickets for the show. Oh. Did you see that old woman on the gray mule go by? Boy, she had the funniest teeth. Oh, yeah. She lives over there. I've seen her lots of times. She wears an orange sun hat. Right. She had the craziest smile. All right, sir, I'll be there in a minute. - I've got to get back to work. - Yeah, you'd better. | like seein’ ya. Can | come talk to you sometime? Sure. All right. Good. Who's that? That's...that's him. Yeah? Great fashion sense, huh? - Can | keep this? - You can keep all of 'em. Thanks. Cassie? You are coming with me, aren't you? - | don't know. - You don't know? | thought you knew. | mean, you said you knew. Well, | know. It's just that I-- | haven't finished paying off those hospital bills yet, and... | realize | don't have enough money, and... I've got that job lined up as soon as | get back to L.A. Money is not a problem. Look, | don't want to just live off you. There are plenty of jobs you can get in L.A. And it'd beat hell out of working at the Elk Lounge, right? That's true. So... what's the problem? How about we leave tomorrow? We'll leave right after Kirk's final, glorious performance of "King Weird." We'll just get in the car and go, huh? Yeah, just get in the car and go. Yeah. Hey, guys, here comes the truck. | mean, why not, you know? It's lousy for you here. | know it's lousy for me here. What if | get there and you decide to leave me? I'd be stuck there, starving in the streets. Oh, you think I'm gonna leave you. - Who knows? - Who knows? Maybe then you'd have to get a job or something. Well, what if there are no jobs available? Cassie, why do you always have to look on the dark, bleak, morbid, fatal side of everything in life? Because | do, | just do. Okay, fine. | don't know what to say. | like you, Cassie. | don't like many people. | like you, too. - Yeah? - Yeah. Maybe you just like that other guy a little better, huh? What guy? There's no other guy! - Yeah. - God, you can be such an idiot! - Idiot? - Idiot! Thanks. Anyway, forget it. Just let me help you pack this stuff. Cassie, let me keep myself organized, okay? Well, what do you want me to do with these tapes? This tape player? The tape player is not the issue! Hey! What the hell was that? - Sounds like one of the lights broke. - Look at this. | just threw my tape deck over the goddamn ledge. You know, you're really getting to me. I'm sorry. Cassie... It's just that I'm not an extremely secure citizen. And | can't take being treated like some dopey, jerk-faced loser, okay? - Okay? - Okay! No, it's not okay. I'm leaving. I'm leaving. Hey, where do these buckets go? Why don't you try 'em on your head? Hey, buddy, don't forget who's paying your salary. Who's drinking? I'm buying. Take off that stupid hat, Kirk, or you can't come. Want to open another bottle? Sure. - He's gonna do it again. - Hot damn! Do it, pard! Put this ‘'un on my tab! - Come on! - All right! Yeah. Where'd you ever learn to do that? Good breeding. - More bourbon? - Oh, yeah. So, you doing anything later on tonight? Game of golf, tennis, polo maybe. Very funny. Well, look, you've drunk all my Burgundy wine. Look, here's some banana creme liqueur. Oh, great. Are you okay? I'm fine. I'm fine. | like to keep my banana liqueur cold. I think it makes it more flavorful. You know... you know, it does. Oh, thanks Shirley. Shirley. Thanks. Shirley. May | give you some unsolicited advice? | really don't think you should take home any more guys whose main accomplishment in life is that they can take off beer-top bottles with their teeth. | mean, Shirley... these guys may look impressive, but they really don't have a lot to offer a good-looking woman like yourself. - Okay. - Hey, Shirley, good night. Bless your heart. My watch. Thanks. What would | do without this? See ya, Shirley. Hey, Shirley, thanks for the party. Hey. Sometimes it just doesn't work. Sometimes. - Another time, okay? - Okay. - Maybe? - Maybe. Come, Romeo. Come now day in night, for thou wilt lie... You better tell her not to do it. She looks like a creep in that dumb pink outfit. | don't like the pink, either. It washes out her color, but | can't tell her that. Trust me, they're all gonna laugh at her. Come on, you little moron. You couldn't hit the side of a barn. Okay, that's it for the pipsqueak. A couple of more tosses for the moron. Come on, let's go. To be or not lo be ain't much of a choice. - Can't-- - It was good, it was good. - This is bullshit! - Hey, I've got people over here. - Hi, Cassie. - Hi. Look, there are a lot of nice people around. All right, all right. I-I can't do it. Wayne Buckeye’s a raving asshole, and | won! Let's go give her a toss! ...as | lay sleeping | dreamed | held you in my arms When | awoke, dear, | was mistaken And | bowed my head and cried You are my sunshine, my only sunshine You make me happy when skies are gray You'll never know, dear, how much | love you Please don't take my sunshine... Nick, give me the house right center lamp on the table. Okay. Yeah, now tilt it down. Okay, more center stage. - Hi. - Hi. Okay, hold it. Now, tighten in that far right house lamp, all right? Gotcha. Hi, Nick. - Oh, hi, Cass, how you doing? - Okay. All right, Cassie, will you take your final position onstage for us, please, ma'am? Okay. Sure. Okay, that's good. Hold it right there. Well, | guess my speech is today. Not very excellent or anything. Sometimes my mouth goes dry when I'm trying to say what I'm feeling behind all those words. Maybe | should just...God... | don't know. What do you think? Hey, we're just hanging lights, Cassie. Sure. Yeah. | know. Okay, I'm finished. - Well, bye. - Bye. Come on, girls. Let's go. Okay. Come on, everybody. Come on. Let's get in your positions. Come on. All right, everyone, okay. How do you like the tooth? It's funny. Do you know what the cook said to the gander? Your goose is cooked. Sight gags will kill 'em every time. Hey, you're pretty nervous, huh? Yes. Well, we're all pretty nervous when we first start out. But, remember, I'll be the first one out there, and believe me, if there's one thing | know how to do, it's to warm up an audience. Well, looks like this bird's lost some of its pluck. - Let's go! - Yeah! Boring! Don't guess he'll be flying south for the winter. No wingspan! Get the horn! No wingspan! ...that runaway's eyes may wink... and Romeo leap to these arms, untalked of... ..whiles | threat, he lives-- words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives. His cape caught on fire. Break out the marshmallows! -1 go, and it is done. - Kirk said he wanted real fire, right? The bell invites me. Hear it not, Duncan, for it is a knell that summons thee to heaven or to hell. You're a joke. What a retard! How do you like that? They're laughing at my Macbeth. Sorry, Winston. | guess that's showbiz. Our third and final performer from the Shakespeare Red Rock Acting Workshop will be Miss Cassie Stoolie. Miss Stoolie will be performing one of Juliet's speeches from William Shakespeare's immortal Romeo and Juliet. Here, hold this. Good luck, Cassie. Oh, no! Not another one! Gallop apace, you fiery-footed... Oh, give us a break! Gallop apace, you fiery-footed st... Say, get those kids out of here! Go on, give her a chance! Gallop... apa... Told you. You did just fine. The dress looked real pretty. I'll go out there and tell them it's over. No. - Cue me if | forget, okay? - Sure. You can't go back out there. Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds... "Towards Phoebus' lodging." ...towards Phoebus' lodging. "Such a wagoneer as Phaeton..." Such a wagoneer as Phaeton would whip you to the west and bring in cloudy night immediately. Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night, that runaway's eyes may wink and Romeo leap to these arms untalked of and unseen. Come night. Come Romeo. Come thou, day in night, for thou would lie upon the wings of night whiter than new snow on a raven's back. Come, gentle night. Come, loving, black-browed night, give me my Romeo. And when he shall die, take him and cut him out in little stars, and he will make the face of heaven so fine that all the world will be in love with night and pay no worship to the garish sun. Oh, | loved it. | thought it was just wonderful. Wasn't she incredible, Mrs. Stoolie? You know, | purchased this penguin at the white elephant booth. Only five dollars. Imagine that. Five dollars. And | know just where I'm gonna put it-- right up on the mantle, where the fishbowl used to be. Cassie, we want you to do your piece at the women's club this fall. You speak for us, all right? Thank you, Mrs. Cain. So... So. So, what'd you think? You were okay. Very okay. - Thanks. - Don't thank me. You did it. Hey, look, | got two free tickets to the spaghetti dinner if you want to go. | love spaghetti. Especially when it's free spaghetti. Let's go eat. Cassie... you were better than okay. You were great. Thanks. Mule rides over here! | really think you ought to go to L. A. I mean, I'd like you to come stay with me, but if you don't want to, okay, fine. You know, that's one thing, but for God's sake, Cassie, you've got to get out of here. No, because just now for the first time in a long while, things are going real well for me here in town. Mrs. Cain did ask me if I'd perform my speech for the women's club this fall. For the women's club? For Christ's sake, Cassie, come on. | know, but maybe | shouldn't leave just yet. Hi, Cass. - Billy. - How you doing? The winner of the Wayne Buckeye look-alike contest for the eighth year running... - ...is Mr. Ned Wilcox. - This is Riley Hood. Riley, this is Billy Downs. Nice to meet you, Riley. How you doing? See you've got your hands full. Yeah. So, Cass, I'm real glad | found you. Can | talk to you for a minute over here? Yeah. Okay. So, Cass, | been thinking about you. Ever since that day you came by when | was... ...cooking steaks. Yeah. | just had to tell you that... well, I'm sorry about things that happened between us. | don't understand how it all... Well, anyway. Hey, you were beautiful on that stage today. - You were. - Thanks. | been thinking about you, all the things we used to do. Gosh, you know, now | miss you. | gotta go. Will you be working down at the Elk tonight? Yeah. I'm going to the outdoor square dance. I'll drop by. - | can't believe it. - What? You're still in love with that asshole. I am not. You were standing there letting him touch your hair with his fingers. | saw. | have eyes. Oh, all right. Cassie, does it mean anything to you that | want you to stay with me? And | don't just mean stay with me. | mean stay with me. - | don't believe you. - Aw, great. It's hard for me to believe what people say. Can't you understand? I'm just scared! Well, get over it. Or at least tell me how | can help you. | mean, what do you want? You want me to... to cry for you, you want me to bleed for you, you want me to kill for you? Do you want me to die for you? What do you want? Tell me--the sky's the limit. Tell me-- Stop it! Stop it! - Just stop it! - Cassie! Cassie! See what you did? You expect me to run off with some crazy lunatic? You're right. Okay, you're right. | lost it, | completely lost it. I'm sorry, Cassie. I love you, Cassie. I love you. It's just I'm not...I'm... Shit. Hey, look, I'm leaving town right after the show tonight. If you decide that you want to go with me for some unknowable reason, just... just be at my place and we'll split. Hey, look... since you're probably not gonna be making the trip with me tonight, | thought you maybe might want my address in L.A. Have you got any paper? Uh.. here. 849... Okay. Juniper Street... L.A., 90046. That's 4-6. | mean...| mean, uh... you know, maybe you'll want to keep in touch, you know? We'll exchange Christmas cards or something. Here. So, um... Fuck. What time is it? 10:35. You could still go. You think | should? Oh, | don't know. I'm no expert, that's for sure. Remember | told you about how Frank and me were just made for each other? Yeah. Well, last night he said I've been getting on his nerves for the past three months. - Really? - Yeah, so he said he's breaking it off. - That's terrible. - | was disappointed. I'd been working on this pillow for his birthday, you know. I've been decorating it up like a car, on account of he's a mechanic and all, but before he left, he said not to bother getting it to him, because even the pillows | made got on his nerves. Now, that was really a surprise to me. Gosh. | guess you never do know how another person is actually feeling. | guess not. Sometimes it's hard because you don't even know what your own feelings are actually feeling. That's true, too. Makes it hard. Sure does. Hey, Hood, what's going on? I'm striking the set. Look, there's a big Buckeye jamboree back at the town square. I'm out of this burg. We were gonna strike that in the morning. It's struck. I'm here. Yeah. Busy night? Real. Well, you're gonna need a little rest and relaxation. Maybe we'll go up to Granite Dell sometime. Remember how we used to row around on the water out there? | could get away next Saturday, just till noon. Oh, there you are. Billy, we've been looking all over for you. Where have you been? I'm exhausted. You said to make two of 'em! Yeah, make that two of 'em, would ya? Hey, why don't you come over? Hey, everybody, this is Cassie Stoolie, the star of this afternoon's performance. Cassie, this is Tucker and Tracy Lee. Hi. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. - And this is Prissy Lee. - Hi. Hi. Cassie's an old friend of mine. So I've heard. Uh, can | take your orders? Yeah, we'll have two scotch-and-waters here. Coca-Cola. Well? Don't you remember? No. Jack Daniels, straight up. Hell, | been drinking it for years. She knows that. Uh, miss, I'd like to change my order, please. I'd like a double gin and tonic. Prissy, now you know you can't be too careful these first few months. Just bring our little new mother a nice Coke for now. Please? Two scotch-and-waters, one Coke, one J.D. straight. Okay, I'll get the scotches. Well, what happened? She's gonna have his baby. Oh, no. Oh, God. Oh, Cassie, I'm...sorry. I'm... I'm sorry. Yeah, well...yeah. | don't care! | don't even care! | don't care! | don't care! | don't care! Oh, Pat, he loves me! He really, really loves me!

Don't you have any other money? Yeah, there's two dollars in my purse. Hey, aren't you gonna tell Mom that you're leaving? No. Well...| guess I'd better. Mama? Mama? I'm going to Los Angeles to live. I'll send you my address when | get there. Did you remember to take your dental stuff? No. Well, you'd better take it. Okay, Mama, go back to sleep. Good night. - Wait. - What? Here. What's this?

And how about these furry slippers? - | don't know. - I'll wear these furry slippers. Here, pack these furry slippers. Yeah, pretty nice slippers. Hey. Hey, what about this? Hey, give me that. Hey, Riley, do you have a dog or a cat or anything? What? No. Well, | never had a pet, and | thought maybe we could get one. Yeah, well, how about we start with a fish, or a turtle, or maybe something that you don't have to feed?
