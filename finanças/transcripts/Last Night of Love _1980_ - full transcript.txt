ROMANIAFILM PRESENTS A FILM BY SERGIU NICOLAESCU LAST NIGHT OF LOVE, FIRST NIGHT OF WAR ADAPTATION OF CAMIL PETRESCU'S NOVEL Platoon, at ease. Good evening, Lieutenant. Good evening. How are you? With current affairs. A cigarette? Thanks. I'll go hunting tomorrow. How about coming to eat with us? I hope there will be no problems for you. Not at all. We're just a neutral country. I'll come with the greatest pleasure. See you tomorrow then. Yes, see you tomorrow. Let's go, boys. From May I was in a regiment that was on the border at Giuvala customs, having on the left the white road of Piatra Craiului, and on the right the Bucegi mountains. A few trenches were all our fortifications. We spent our time in training and heroic assaults that were not far from children's games. To me that concentration was a long despair, spending my nights in dry and devastating insomnia. LAST NIGHT The jury acquitted Mr. Ionescu Pandelie accused of murder out of jealousy. Sir, the wife must be really a wife and the home really a home. If she can't be faithful, she must't get married. You have children, you have troubles, and she messes arround? If I had been sworn in, I would have acquitted him, too. By what right to kill a woman who no longer loves you? All you have to do is part with her. You can't impose love. I agree. Why rape a woman's soul? The right to love is sacred and any woman has the right to seek her happiness. And what about the man's reputation? Captain Dimiu, do you admit to kill a woman because she can't love you anymore? I don't know how that comes about, but I would acquit the one who killed his wife because she left her husband and children. Captain, you know, I begged you again... I have to go to Campulung... I have to be there tomorrow. It's a matter of honor, you understand me, don't you? Lieutenant, I've told you ten times it's impossible! It's impossible! What if a woman says, "We're breaking up?" You should answer "No"? The woman is sentenced to life. She has no right to divorce. I wasn't talking about divorce. I was just saying that the woman who is cheating on her husband... No, not even then. Your discussion is childish and primary. You know nothing about the psychology of love. Love is something else. And if you don't know what it is, with all your notions which you heard I don't know where you can talk for a lifetime and you will not understand anything. Better talk about what you know. Lieutenant! Lieutenant, tonight our company must give three posts. Tudor .. you can leave. I managed to persuade him. Return tomorrow night. Thanks. I had been married for almost two years to a colleague from the university and I suspected that she was cheating on me. It was an unimaginable suffering that fed on its own substance. We married out of love, both of us poor. Is she your wife? Yes. It is obvious that you married out of love. Like two stupid people. Nicholau... make them understand. Mr. Luca Mavrodin considers it necessary that every member of the family with the right of inheritance, to accept the preconditions contained in these envelopes. Mr. deputy Constantin Mavrodin. Well, Costache, how's politics going? You twist it, you twist it? Don't start a war, that one keeps sucking his fingers.. If I had the capital, I would now be a minister I knew that ministers are ministers to make money, not to spend it! That was before, now it's different! I didn't know your grandfather had so much humor. He has so much humor that after my father's death, for ten years he didn't let us cross his threshold. That's fine the way you like. Why are you silent, cousin? I'm in God's hands and yours, Luca. Now, the children. Ionel Mavrodin. Did you pass the class? I took a seven. At music? He graduate, Dad. What are you doing? He will be the first in class , I tell you. Let him be stupid, let him be a minister. Tudor Gheorghiu, nephew. Thanks, Grandpa. We don't need it. I'm afraid we'll remain poor but beautiful. Mr. Gheorgiu. Please, I accompany you. Thanks, but our home is very near. I know you're on the outskirts of Bucharest and it's late. Please, Tudor. Yes? Do you also deal with art, ma'am? No, I'm studying philology, in the third year. Tudor finished his philosophy and is now at Belle Arte. I understand you came from Paris. It means you have crossed a bloody Europe. What impression did you have, Mr. Nicolau? At the Monte Carlo casino, the bloodshed on the front is not very noticeable. In fact, I had to deal with some of your grandfather's real estate business. And how, you crossed Europe in the middle of a war? No, ma'am. I returned on the Mediterranean. If your husband had opened the envelope tonight you could have gone the same way, in reverse, of course. I believe that Tudor acted in the most dignified manner possible. Of course, and he has all my admiration. It's like Mr...Gheorghiu would have bet on horse racing with the least chance. I did not consider any chance, Mr. Nicolau. However, the race continues, Mr. Gheorghiu. Mr. Nicolau... I think it's better to stop here. The street is full of potholes and it's a shame the car. Do not worry. Do you live here? How romantic. Yes, here. Is it hard to drive something like that? Much easier than it seems at first glance. Orghidan! Did your grandfather buy a car with the driver included? Sorry. Get to know each other. Mr. Orghidan, Mr. Lawyer Nicolau. Good evening. Orghidan. Still a student? No, engineer. In the free time guardian of the future masterpieces. Orghidan..Orghidan Petre. Yes. You are the one who scares everyone with the articles in "The Socialist" I thought you were two meters tall. I really am! If the lady agrees, I would invite all three of you to have a glass of champagne at Capsa Thank you very much, Mr. Nicolau. I feel tired. Such beauty gets tired... Then I will drink alone in your honor. Good night. Ladies and gentlemen, the late Mr. Luca Mavrodin left a will, which he actually and legally annulled a month ago, by a codicil, the only one with enforceable value. A month ago was that memorable day. We're bankrupt, boy. We're going to look at schools made with his money like cats look at butter. After the special bequests due to my favorite nephew Tudor Gheorghiu will be extracted the rest will be divided into three equal parts. One to my daughter Maria Gheorghiu and her daughters. God forgive you, Dad. Another, to my son Constatin Mavrodin and to his family. The old man had a good soul... My cousin Aristide Grigore's third. I kiss your hand... So I leave it to my favorite nephew Tudor Gheorghiu Four million lei gold, the bread factory, the shares of the "Oltul" company the house in Bucharest, it means this and the Calypso Hotel in Monte Carlo. Calypso? This is a misinterpretation, esteemed lawyer! It's abusive! This is what it says here: "I leave it to my favorite nephew" Maybe it's written! Then what do you want? I will sue it. I'll fill all the newspapers! Because in our perverted times there is no more honor, devotion, spirit of sacrifice! Me, who sat near him when he eas ill... Sister .. Listen to me, you'll live on the streets! These poor girls will get married when I 'll become a priest! Because our artist will lose all his fortune! Like his father! Dad, what about me? Why weren't you his favorite nephew? Why, why? Don't let yourself be influenced by their circus! Don't give them anything! Welcome, sir! Welcome! Lena! Tudor? Tudor! Lena! I was rude, that's true. He became livid, he was about to hit me, but .. my gaze froze him. I was unhappy and capable of anything. You know, I didn't get any news from you. I was crazy. I knew you were alone. You know, I thought you left. Here you are. Both of them. I wanted to punish you because I missed you so much. It's true? At one point I wanted to come. And why didn't you come then? For you to come here. Newspapers! Newspapers! Tell me, Tudor, what are you doing there on the border? Are you preparing for war? Stories. I don't think we're going to war. On the contrary! It's absolutely safe. Today is the crown council. I see you're well informed! And what, there were no councils? I wish all these stories were over at once. Aren't you afraid of war? No. Aren't you, really? You know, Lena? Sometimes I see myself leading a company on the attack bullets, explosions .. My picture on the front page of the newspapers, with my chest full of decorations... Tudor! And you, the hero's wife, will give interviews. Tell me, Tudor, what if something happens to you? You will be the most beautiful widow in Europe. You're kidding and I'm serious. Why are you worried? You know I'm going to leave a will. Even with a will. You know how your family is. I'll probably have to trial them. With your mother, with your relatives. But I'm not dead yet. Really, Tudor, I'm serious. So what do you want? Put some of the english pounds from the bank on my name. Coachman! I have to go to a pharmacy. A comrade asked me to get him something. See you at home, okay? I'm waiting for you. You can go. Hello. What do you want? Some aspirin. The aspirins. Yes, thank you. Lieutenant. You are in my regiment. What are you doing here? I am the lieutenant in reserve Tudor Gheorghiu, 30th Regiment 3rd Infantry Battalion Colonel, I was sent on a mission to Rucar and allowed myself to deviate here. I ordered that no one should leave the unit! Come on, get in the carriage. I'll take you to Dambovicioara and from there you'll walk. Colonel, it's impossible for me to leave now. Let me until at night, I'll come then. What are you saying, sir! Get in the car or I'll arrest you right away. At once! I understand. Where are your things? Straight ahead and second right. Look, look..That distinguished gentleman is the president .. I thought he didn't even exist, that only his picture was published in the newspaper. I heard he beats the maids with a cane. Oh, how wicked you are! Welcome, my dears! I was waiting for you! Let me introduce you to the high society. You are gorgeous! Mr President, I recommend my favorite nephew and his wife. Tudor Gheorghiu, artist. The fear of his generation. Nice to meet you. Any interest? With pleasure, available. Thank you. Here you go. Don't you know Petra? She's our relative. If she's kind of a second cousin to me, she must be your aunt. She's a bomb, nothing else! Take care of our beautiful niece. Her husband, Stan has 3,000 hectares in Ramnicel Half of the fortune is made by Petra, with her "work"... And what "work"... 3000 hectares.... I also invited Nicolau, a guy with relationships... Great poker player, the women adore him. Look at that pig, Zahiu. Dangerous guy. Do you know anyone here? No... Ah, only lawyer Nicolau. Nice man. Then let's go there. Let me introduce you. Minister Florescu, Mrs. Gheorghiu. I kiss your hands. Good evening. Mr. Nicolau .. Mrs.. We are tough, Tudore. If we were united, our generation would ride all these assholes. Leave her alone, sir, she can handle it! So you smoke, hm? That's better! Do you look at books? Is necessary! It is impossible without them in these times. We live in hard times! Champagne.. I trained you well. We must have a great ambience... a little coffee, an olive, a "Dame"(card games) Listen, Tudor. What are you going to do with the money you inherited? I was thinking... Think what? You have no practical spirit, listen to me, you will lose your fortune. You don't make no money with your art. With Kant, with Schopenhauer, you don't make big deal when it comes to business. They will be good in other fields, I don't deny it but I'm much more practical than they are when it comes to dough. Uncle, I don't think I'll do business. I wish I'd live like I did until now. As if you've lived so far. Tell me, how are you going to maintain a woman like your wife? With rope stockings? She doesn't think about such trifles. Maybe there is romantic love, too. But I have a metallurgical factory. We make bullets, cannonballs. What is required on the market. But it needs capital. I'm going in. Are you going too? I'd like to bring up a newspaper. A newspaper? Not a bad idea. You bury and dig up any time whoever you want . It goes well even if there's a war. Do you think we're going to go to war? Well, nobody knows, but it doesn't matter. The arms business works anyway. We sell to the one who entered in war. Come on, let's make the deal. Come on! Mr. Gheorghiu. If you get a lottery ticket, you're not sure you'll win. But if you don't take it you're sure, you're definitely not going to win, sir. Am I wrong? What do you mean, Mr. Zafiu? I was thinking about business, Mr. Gheorghiu. I did wonderful business with your grandfather Such times! I was once shocked that I spent a month in the hospital. If you want to print something, a novel or I know .. I have a printing house, I am at your disposal. You give me the materials and I print them for you. You only pay the cost. Or if you want to sell the bread factory .. Excuse me.. ... I'm an amateur .. And now, ladies, the surprise of the evening! Mr. Nicolau will show us a new dance! Tangoul. Mrs.. Why are you so nervous? I think she manages to be adored by both men and women. Were you jealous from the beginning? From the beginning. At first she lived in a boarding house with a college classmate I had met and liked. But Lena was so young and so reckless that in the end she won. As I try to hide our love, she did her best to display it ostentatiously, even proudly. I started to like her precisely because of the admiration that everyone had for me because I was loved so much. And one day you realized you loved her. Yes. I had fallen in love with her precisely because of the joy I was giving her. It hasn't changed. Why are you talking about the past? This world has changed her. Women get used to it much easier. The instinct .. You must know that the instinct also makes the tiger to tear the trainer. if the reckless cut his hand. Do you think that the inheritance has awakened new instincts in her? New? There are instincts that sleep latently in all women. The woman cheats only on the one she loves. She simply leaves the others. I see no consolation in this. So much lucidity is unbearable. As much lucidity, as much happiness or drama. With what pleasure I would deceive you for this jealousy! So you wouldn't have left me? Maybe. Young women are stupid. They have fixed ideas. What was your fixed idea? The instinct you were just talking about. Not to be poor. We have to go home. But what happened? Lena, I want to go home. I want to stay a little longer. Shall we dance? All right. It's that why you brought me here, to make it easier for you to tame? You get upset? Yes, I think so. I think you deserve a better fate. Welcome to this bright and creative world, Mr. Gheorghiu. The play was written, the show is in full swing. Women persuade ministers ... Are you tense or I am wrong? You are wrong. I feel admirable. Are you interested in bullets? What? The idea of bullets, cannonballs? What if I was interested? Your grandfather would never have had the courage or the necessary culture to get into an arms deal. But he relied on his favorite nephew. The envelope at the time in the cemetery contained the inheritance clause for accepting exactly this idea. I told him you were an intellectual and... it must leave you free to act. Now I think he's smiling contentedly in his grave. Please excuse me. This time, bad luck in love. Luck is mine. I'd like to go home. I'll stay more. He has five ladies. With Petra. A carriage please. Driver! Me? You. A bitch on the street in my bed? Your bed, really? Then sleep in it, madam, don't wander whole night! Stop here. I'll come quickly, Colonel. One moment, Lieutenant. Your gun may drop. Better give it to me. What happened, Tudor? I met the colonel, he's out, he's waiting for me. I have to get to the unit tonight, he gave me orders. I'm going upstairs to get some more stuff. "Ma'am, I'm at Campulung for lunch today. If you want, answer me when I can come and pay my respects to you. Andrei Nicolau. " I am leaving. I'll write to you. Is that why you said you didn't want to leave? It's my wife, Colonel. How? Then what were you doing in the city, when you have such a beautiful wife? Here's the revolver. Please excuse me. Of course a stupid thing... A kind of hallucination. Seeing your face so terrified,as if you were sick I had said to myself: "This man is going to kill someone" Have you been married for a long time? For almost two years. Unfortunately, there are few women that it's enough to look at once They have such eyes... Sorry, no eyes, the glance .. I'm sure you have a wonderful wife. I feel covered in the memory of the sorrowful smile and the look of my wife when I was leaving. What would have been my life without her? Are you sleeping, sir? No, Colonel, I was thinking only.. This can't be called life anymore. It's been two years since I've been here on the border. I don't have a home anymore. Do you have children, Colonel? Two, a boy and a girl. Both in high school. But what do I know about them? We almost got estranged. My only fun is coming here in town and seeing the world. Okay, but today is Saturday. You could have stayed until tomorrow. The general called me to him and told me to be with the regiment tonight. There's something about the war. Do you think we're getting in this summer? I personally don't think so, if I haven't entered so far. Even if today I talked to a major in the division, a reservist who was telling me that today is the Crown council and that it would be something... Was he from Bucharest? Yes, from Bucharest. He seems to have ties up because he knows a hell of a lot about war riches. He said the ladies walk from office to office and they don't leave my petition until it's approved. And do you really believe that? Ehh, he told me many others. Aren't you from Bucharest? Then you must know him. Lawyer Nicolau, darling. A guy in his 45s? Exactly, it's him. I thought you knew him. Yes, I know him. But what he was doing in Campulung? He is concentrated, next to us in Giuvala. 22 infantry. He often comes on leave to Campulung. It looks like it's about a woman, as far as I can "smell". Yes, it seems to be very successful in women. I also knew some of his adventures. Yes, he told me too. This Nicolau is such a womanizer... He told me a very good one. In the spring, before my concentration, I went to Sinaia. I had to go back the next day. But I met a friend who brought me in his car the same night. Lena? Isn't the lady home? No, sir. Did he tell you where she is? No, sir. All right, go to bed. I would have liked to dream, so that waking up is possible. I was afraid I would go crazy until dawn. I would never want to see you again. Are you chasing me then? I don't know. So you are chasing me? I can't figure it out. Understand what you want. Say if you have anything to clarify. I have nothing to clarify. Indeed, you will not be able to clarify anything. So, you drive me away. "So, you're driving me away." He left and slammed the door. Two days later I found the papers on the desk, a note from Petra inviting Lena to sleep with her. When asked, she confirmed the fact to me. I ran to her and apologized, bringing her home again. Imagine, sir, the letter was written by him and put by the maid in the proper place so the madman could find it. Well, he was going to ruin his family! What letter? The letter, sir! The letter the madman found after his wife left! So the letter was tricked? Isn't that great? What a smart guy, no joke. And the husband is an ox! He deserves his horns! Colonel, you are expected. Order from the division to call urgently. Easy, "mon cher" (my dear). My legs are numbed. Vasile. Order. You have ten Napoleons if you return with me now to Campulung. The horses are tired. At least to Rucar. They're very tired, Lieutenant. Vasile, you have twenty Napoleons, with this money you buy 10 carriage horses! You will create troubles, Lieutenant. That means desertion. Tudor! It's war. END OF PART I PART II THE FIRST NIGHT OF WAR Officers .. It's war. Please write down. Shut up, you. I will dictate your battle order. Why are you standing here? Go away. At 10 o'clock, the assembly of the battalion on companies. At 10.30 the mobilization effects are divided. At 10.45, each man is given 200 war cartridges. We line up on the road to Giuvala customs and at 11.45 we start. Who orders the 9th company? Lieutenant Tudor Gheorghiu. George! Order! You will be at the forefront. You know how to unfold. Choose sturdy people and try to conquer customs without bloodshed. I understand. Remember, security patrols on the flanks. And now, gentlemen, execute the order! Easy.. Ready, Zamfire? Ready, Lieutenant. Come on, guys, go one by one. One by one, I said. What do you say, Tudore? What should I say? I thought there hadn't been a war in forty years. Reading books have stopped at '77 and now, exactly me.. Well done, Gheorghiu, I see you're ready! I'll attack first, Doctor! Don't forget your luggage! Do you think we will need them again? It is unknown at this time... The lucky ones will live. So it was in '77. Watch out for the security patrols on the flanks. Success! Lieutenant, aren't you wearing your cloak? I don't need it, Dumitru. How are you going to stay that way? I don't need it, I said! How was at Campulung? He was there, too. Nicolau? A few minutes ago it occurred to me to run to Campulung, to have an explanation with my wife. At most, I should have risked being shot. Anyway I will dying this night. What else should she explain to you? How important can her explanations be now? Tudor, aren't you looking around? Now you are connected to them, to these people who now feel closer to you than to their mothers and wives! Last night your conscience allowed you to kill. I had nothing to complain about me. Ah, and now your cowardice allows you to escape the danger they cannot avoid? You, Tudor! If not out of other feelings, at least out of pride, do your duty! Orghidan .. I know I have no talent. I don't give a shit about this mortal world. I tried to realize myself in an absolute love. I tried. So? Can you answer me? Lieutenent? What should we do with this meat? Who is going to eat anymore now? However, what should we do? Throw it away! I understand! Come on, come on! Lie down! The bridge blew up, Lieutenant. Stay put there! Stay there! Nobody moves there! Load, boys, load. Don't shoot anymore, they are ours! Don't move! What's wrong with you? Withdrawal order! Get in the yard now! Nobody retreats! Shoot anyone who tries to get over you! Order! Stay still, second Lieutenant. What's the matter with you? They distroyed us! No withdrawal order. Enter the yard immediately! I have to pass! I'll shoot you! Get in the yard now! Zamfir, Marin. Stick the bayonets in anyone trying to get through! Come on! Come quickly. Go! Go! Go. What about these, Lieutenant? They want to retire,they are from the 22nd Regiment. What should we do, Captain? How come, "what should do we do", Gheorghiu? Move on! I get it. Guys! Zamfir! I'm going with you! Come over! Why isn't fire our artillery? It's street fighting, what should the artillery do here? The reserve should fire then. It will be better that way. Wait, who is it? Tudor, is your gun loaded? I don't have any more cartridges. I don't have it anymore. I think I lost it. It's okay. Come on, boys. Come on! Where do you want to fire the artillery? Why don't they respond to our fire? Company commander! I think they ran away. Company commander! Here! Order to stay put! Good. I'm going back to my company. Are you cold, Lieutenant? You're going to get sick. Guys, get closer. I'll give you the blanket. Give it here, come on! This way you're going to warm up. As of now, we will share with you both good and evil. Lena .. Would you die of grief if I perished? He fell asleep. LIEUTENANT TUDOR GHEORGHIU DECORATED WITH THE STAR OF ROMANIA CLASS I FOR SPECIAL DEEDS OF COURAGE ON THE NORTH FRONT. On the right we have the 22nd Battalion commanded by Major Nicolau. Good boy Nicolau .. Attack ahead! Forward! Lie down! Come on, boys! Take it, Colonel. Thank you, my dear. Gheorghiu, you attacked the first last night, too. Get your company up and move. Go with the people crawling one after the other. As you get out of the fire, attack with the bayonet. I understand. You too, Orghidan. The ninth company, dragged after me, forard! Attack boys, after me! Forward! Follow me, boys! Gheorghiu, lie down! Forward! Grenades! Follow me, boys! Follow me! Lie down, Gheorghiu! Forward! Prisoner, prisoner! Wait, sir, don't you see I'm Romanian? What a soldier, sir! He remained alone in front of a thousand people. A good gunner. If it wasn't for Bolovan, Gheorghiu would be on the losing list. Bolovan maybe, but Nicolau shouted first. I wasn't able to shout at all... Do you have a cigarette? Of course. Come on, gentlemen, let's sleep now. You hate him so much. Seeing him running in front of me for a moment I thought I might kill him. I am humbled by the thought that he saved my life. Wake up, Tudor! Wake up, you are no longer on Calea Vicoriei, at Capsa. So he cheated on me. She cheated on me. SHE CHEATED ON ME! Did you have a bad dream, darling? Colonel, can civil documents be drawn up here? What kind of civil acts do you want to do? A donation. A letter to the bank. I don't know, ask the boys if there is a lawyer among them. Today is Saint Mary. My wife's day. And my wife's. What a beautiful woman, sir. Beautiful.

I think so, from the factory, right? Yes, from the factory. I'm sorry you're hurt. But what's the matter with you? A bullet in the stomach. But it doesn't hurt me. I think I'll get well and go home. You know, I have two kids. Mr. Zafiu offers 2,800,000. Anyone else pays more? Listen, you, Zafiu, don't you think your feets are kind of unwashed to disturb my water? ... This is comerce. You're a merchant, I'm a merchant. Mr. Zafiu offered two million. Tell the German to support me , if not, I'll send Vasiliu, his brother-in-law in prison. He is a romanian, like all of us. Does anyone offer more? You're going to bite your hands(regret), Zafiu. Those hands with which you don't even know how to sign. You're going to be ruined, you, illiterate! The joint stock company offers 2,820,000 thousand in gold. The price of the metallurgical factory reached, gentlemen, the amount of 2,820,000 lei in gold! Does anyone offer more?

Who do you think I've met? Your wife! I greeted her, I introduced myself. She asked me to tell you that she was still at Campulung and she asks you, if you can, to come to her until Sunday. She wants to go to Bucharest. What, are you sick? No, nothing, a dizziness. Take care. You know, honey, we've all heard that the Germans are preparing for a great offensive in autumn. They are going to bring a lot of artillery to place them in the mountains.. The colonel's news has an unexpected effect on me. Lena is still in Campulung! All this time she was waiting for me alone here, near the front. Battalion 2 div 31 infantry Lieutenant Dumitru. Major Dimiu from the 2nd Div 30th Infantry Battalion. I came for the entire regiment, Colonel. I salute you, Colonel I would ask you to take the envelope for the 22nd Regiment. With pleasure, but I saw Major Nicolau coming for it. He's at the general's. He's probably asking for a permission. Great womanizer, sir. Come on. I'll give you a horse, dear. Take these envelopes to Dimiu. I would have another request. Get to the 22nd. Leave these envelopes for them. Nicolau was supposed to come, but what should I do? He's friends with the general. So you transmit: They will open at 12 o'clock the envelopes containing the regimental action orders. I'll go there, I'll find them together, probably hugged .. Yes, I should expect that moment. The proof of so many tormenting thoughts. Don't you know where is the 3rd Battalion? Don't you know where is the 3rd Battalion? Don't you know where is the 3rd Battalion? The 3rd Battalion, haven't you seen it? Second Lieutenant, 3rd Battalion 30th Regiment, do you know anything about them? I haven't met them, Lieutenant, I think they are in the rearguard. Heavy fighting ensued. At the beginning of the night it was a heavy german attack. Thanks. Orghidan! Are you Zamfir? Guys! Dumitru, Zamfir .. Guys, where are you, guys? Orghidan, Zamfir, Dumitru! Where are you, guys? Guys, Orghidane, where are you? Where are you, guys? Zamfir! Gheorghiu! Lieutenant, you did it. Yes, Doctor. Yes, they ruined us completely. They left me alone and they all left. I brought some wounded and the major. Major Nicolau. Seriously injured in the lungs. I don't think he will make it. He has no chance. Come on. Mr. Gheorghiu. I'm glad to see you. You are friends? Then, it's good. I must go, I have to evacuate the others. You know, I have an order. General withdrawal order and I would not want to be caught by the Germans. Doctor... do you have an anesthetic? I'm sorry, darling, but I don't. Doctor... Leave him alone. He is right. He has to take care of the others. Stay.. Stay with me until the end. It won't last long. If the lady agreed, I would invite all three of you to have a glass of champagne at Capsa. Thank you very much, Mr. Nicolau, I feel tired. Such beauty gets tired? Lieutenant, we have to go. Order to take the tent, you know... it's on the inventory. You can take it. I kept it for the end of the war and since it's over for me .. It's good.. Drink... you are my guests... It is snowing? What do you say? It's snowing, isn't it? I think so.. I think it's really snowing. Wonderful. Too bad I can't see. NOVEMBER In four hours you will find me another headquarters and install it. Got it? What else happened? General, I am reserve lieutenant Tudor Gheorghiu. 3rd Battalion, 30th Infantry Regiment. Yes, talk, Lieutenant. I'm listening to you. General, I'm guilty of destroying the 3rd and 2nd Battalions of the 22nd and 30th Infantry Regiments. On the night of September 13, I didn't deliver the envelopes with the withdrawal order. That's all we need. Gentlemen, is this man crazy? Here's the proof, General. Did anyone ask you anything? Go outside and wait. He lost his mind. Tudor Gheorghiu. Two months ago, the first officer cited on the agenda, decorated and decorated again Now should I put him on the wall like a traitor? This can have repercussions on the division as well. Go and talk to him, Constantinescu. You've always been on the front lines since the beginning of the war... weariness, comrades who fell .. and now the retreat... All these can make crazy anyone. War is a big nuisance, sir. But death...death is very different. Especially death by execution is madness! Some soldiers takes you, put you on the wall and shoot at you? Don't you realize? You're a hero, sir! You were the first Romanian officer cited by the king on the army's agenda! The newspapers from Bucharest shouted about your heroism! And now, what do you want? What will the world say about us? We're also involved anyway, aren't we? This is the war. Do you think that in Turtucaia, the dead or the prisoners who fell, weren't killed by a cause? But how important is a division or two in a war? You don't win ot loose a war for two batalions! You have a family... you are a member of society, you can't be put on the wall like that, like an infamous man! And in fact... it's not your fault. The German attack was imminent. Look, get in here. You have a clean room, a towel, everything you need. I had taken it for myself. Think it over. I'll come and get you tomorrow morning. Nobody bothers the lieutenant, is that clear? I understand, sir! You also have a bottle of wine and something to eat. Tomorrow will be different. Good night. Thank you, Colonel. I almost forgot. Do you have a gun? Give it to me, I don't want you to do anything stupid. Tudor .. Tudor! Why are you crying, Lena? You suffer? Tudor? I'm afraid! Don't be afraid! Bravo, Lena, bravo! Do you know that I love you? Of all the women I've met, only one offered me endless days and nights of joy, of immersion in delight. If it weren't for her, my wife, I would have died without knowing what happiness means. What it means to be loved by your loved one. Can you give me some water? All of them told me so. We can count on it. Tomorrow, all depemds on what you will declare. Lena, would you die of pain if... I perished? Tudor, why do you think I came here? Nicolau died. He, also because of me. I don't know why you're still thinking about Nicolau. It's war, isn't it, so many people are dying! Tomorrow's trial it's what matters. So that we can be together again, so that we don't care about others, so that we can both live happily ever after. I can't stand suffering and suspicion anymore. I can not take it anymore. That's all you tell me when you know he's dead. Don't you want me to tell you what were his last words before he died? Don't you want to, Lena? Are you starting again? Even in these moments you still think of a stranger which you want at any cost to consider as my lover? Didn't you torment me enough and didn't you suffer enough? Tudor, be reasonable. We are still young and not all is lost! I talked to Uncle Costica He arranged everything. And those an the Palace agreed. A commission and that's it. You will be exempt from the army and you will be able to return home. My dear, think about what will happen. I will have to stand a trial for the inheritance and you know how mean they are. Be reasonable, Tudor. Please. This last night I realized that she is a stranger to me, that the whole past is so far away, as if it didn't exist. And as never in my life, now I know what I want. Lacking talent, in this mortal world I tried to realize myself in an absolute love. I was wrong. And now I can't desert the only act of conscience.
