[Thunder & Rain] [Running water] [Phone ringing] Hello? No, I'm alright. No. It's really, it doesn't really seem to be helping me at all, I can't get rid of the images, you know the nightmares, I still have it, you know storms really don't help. It just brings back everything. Yeah...I'm just trying to move on you know, it's really hard for me to try to wipe these images out of my head and you know what happened, it's just been, it's been tough. Yeah. Well, maybe we can get together soon. Alright...I appreciate it. I'll be alright. Alright, see ya. There's a new urban legend out there and the people in this small quaint town are calling it the Pig Witch. Some don't know what to believe after a video of four friends appeared on the internet last year documenting and discovering this pig like creature. [TV Audio: We've got to get out of here now] Ever since then, the video has been viewed thousands of times. Is it real or is it an indie film hoax? Three of those people have vanished and the only survivor Sikora has been cleared of any criminal charges, some people say the video was a publicity stunt to get Sikora noticed. Some say it's the real thing, we asked a few locals about what they thought about this so called Pig Witch. Well, it could be true...I mean I'm not sure, I never seen it myself. I heard some guys in my town like chased it around or almost saw it something like that. I don't know...probably a crock. Have you seen the video on the internet on The Pig Witch? No I am not allowed to watch videos on the internet because my mom doesn't allow me to. but I went over to my girlfriends house and I watched a video there and it was really, really scary. So do you believe in the pig witch by watching that? Yes I do...very scary. Believe in it? I've seen it online. I mean, it kinda scared me. Do you think it's a publicity stunt on Sikora's part? Not really, because if you think about it, you can't expect a certain friend to have come out or not come out because where are the other friends? I'm kinda skeptical on that I kinda liken that to the Jersey Devil legend, I'm not sure if it's real or not real I heard stories about it down at Batsto but I don't know if its real, I've never seen it. Local farmers have often talked about a creature that they believe to be the culprit behind the missing livestock, causing quite a stir in this little town. Yeah I've seen it a bunch of times, came running through the crops here. My dad sicked the dogs on him, it was crazy, it was wild! I really don't know, I just moved here and my kids have told me things that they have heard about this pig thing and showed me some stuff on the internet. Its kind of creepy, I live on the river so, I don't want my dogs going out at night you know...I really don't believe in things like that but when you're standing out there in the dark, you kind of wonder. Yeah I don't believe in ghosts or any of that. This film is probably made up by filmmakers. Not unless I see a pig wit and if I see a pig wit, I'll be that way, whatever but I will not be going his way. Seems kind of scary but I don't know if this is real, I don't know. I don't even think I would wanna go into the woods. I don't know it could be real if you believed in that kind of stuff. Sikora was not available to comment on the story and has been avoiding cameras ever since the trial that cleared him of any criminal charges. We caught up with his brother to see if he could update us on the story. My brother? He's actually never been the same since the incident, You know, hes lost a couple friends, he doesn't really like to talk about it much so there's not much I can tell you, sorry... The whereabouts of the three young men who were with Sikora are still unknown and funerals were held for them last year. It is a definitely an urban legend that feels real Jim but it seems like we will never know what happened out there. This is Helen Sommers reporting live from Hammonton NJ. Still ahead, is the swine flu a risk to your pets? [Uncomfortable Music] Can I help you? Hi, you're Sikora right? Yeah. I really need your help, you know my brother Al, you were involved in that incident that happened with him. I'm sorry, I'm not. Please, please I need your help. I need to pay my last respects to him, I never got to say goodbye, I just really need you to take me where it happened. You are...You are the only one that can help me. I'll do anything you want, I really miss him, I just feel like if you just took me there, I'll pay you money anything. Please. I'll pay you $5,000. I just need to go where it happened. You don't understand the situation that we went through? He was my only brother, I can't move on. You give me $5,000 and I'll drop you off and you know that's it. I'll drive, I'm not getting out of the car. That's it. I'm sorry...I can't even... OK $5,000 got it. [Dark music] Looks like the road is closed...Uh, I guess we can take some of it. Now I know it's somewhere around here, uh I think we have a little ways to go. Like I said we're not gonna stop long, I am just gonna let you go, I'm not here to mess around. Can we stop, I really need to go to the bathroom? You have to go right now? Yeah, we've been driving for like 2 hours. You can't hold it until we get there? I can't hold it anymore. I just want to get there. I really gotta go. I'm just gonna pull over here you gonna run in the woods, cause I just want to get out of here, this is freaking me out already. I'll be really quick. Thank you so much for stopping, alright let's go c'mon. Do you want me to go with you? No, I'll be real quick. Oh my God, this is ridiculous, thanks for coming. She better hurry up. You know, I really don't know why you're dragging me out here like this, I didn't come here for this, time is money and you better cut me a piece of that check that she gave you. This is taking too long, I am going to go out there. Amanda! Amanda! You're taking too long. How long has she been? 5, 10 minutes? Doesn't take that long to take a piss. Listen guys, I looked all over, I can't find her anywhere. So you expect us to look for her with you or something? Well I am not leaving without her. She is paying you guys money to take her here. I'm gonna go look for her, I'll be a few minutes, just give me the keys you guys aren't going anywhere. What?! You think we should go help him or something, I really don't wanna stay in this car. Uh, I don't wanna go out there, she could be playing games I don't even know what's going on right now... Let's just get her and go cause I just wanna get out here. I don't even want to be out here, I don't even care about this dumb girl. John! Amanda! [Tense Music] Help! Guys over here, help me please I'm stuck! What happened?

[Rain falls on car] [Strange scream in distance] What's that? What's that noise? Something out there.. [Man screams] John! John! What is that? [Eating sounds] Oh my God!

[Heavy Breathing & Thunder] [Lightning strikes] I wanna get out of here, It just wanna get out of here. It got John, what are we gonna do? [Rain stops] There's a car, there's a car coming. No ma'am, go back to your car! Guys do you need any help? What? Go back to your car! Do you need a ride, I can give you a ride? No! Go back to your car, no! [Pig Witch scream and woman screams] Let's get out of here! Run, go!

[Chains rattling] [Pig Witch squealing] No, please! Don't, don't... No! Please! Please no! [Pig Witch screams, human screaming] [Human screaming] [Door slams shut] [Pig Witch squeals, chainsaw starts up] [Chainsaw chopping up man] [Deathly screams] [Devastating Emotional music] [Creaking dungeon sounds] Al...get up.

[Pig Witch screaming] [Emotional yet intense slow music] [Heartbeat pounds loud] [Heartbeat speeds up] [Emotional intense music] [Pig Witch squeals in the distance] [Crickets chirping] [Sad Reflective music] Al, I miss you so much, you were such a good brother...I love you. [Flies buzzing] [Woman screams] I'm not gonna let this thing get me... I'm gonna stop this thing. It's not gonna ruin my life, anymore. It's over. [Driven & Inspiring music] [Pounding drums with an epic choir] [Tribal war drums] [Pounding drums with an epic choir] [Music fades with Crickets chirping] [Thunder rumbling] [Music slowly building] [Lightning strikes] [Pouring rain and thunder] I am here! I am waiting for you! Do you want me?! [Lightning crashes] [Rain passes and Crickets return] [Pig Witch eating flesh] [Intense chase music] [Pig Witch Screams] [Sound of Pig Witch falling into trap] [Pig Witch Screams] [Intense music] [Intense music] [Pig Witch screams] [Stabbing Pig Witch and screams] [Heartbeat sound] [Exhausting Emotion music] [Pig Witch attacks and screams] [Stabbing sounds] [Pig Witch screaming in pain] [Victorious music] Although you may not believe me... My story is true. Through all the sacrifice it took to get me here, I can finally say I found a new strength I never knew I had. What is redemption? It is the deliverance from evil, it is getting back something that has been taken away. If it was not for this moment, I would still be hiding in darkness, in fear. Through my friends I found strength and I was determined to make it through. Although there was sacrifice, in the end they helped me become free and I will never forget that. Now I have a question for you. What does it take to find your strength, to find redemption. You may not believe but my story is true.
