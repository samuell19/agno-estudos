Filmed in New Guinea last week, sir. General MacArthur is arriving in Melbourne tomorrow. I'll be meeting him at the station. The Aussies are holding the line, sir, but we need to send reinforcements up there damn quick. Hell, it gets worse by the minute. We're with you all the way, Mac! Ladies and gentlemen, all I am saying is that you are going to have 48 thousand American troops deposited on your soil within a week and it's my job to make their lives and yours tolerable. For example, perhaps we could have movies on Sunday. See you around, Burt. Black market gone all right, is it? Now that's what I call cooperation. All right, sir. What do you want us to do? We need your cooperation so our men can have a good time but stay out of any real trouble. Gambling, drinking, a place to meet women. But under controlled conditions so that is doesn't get out of hand and not disrupt the community. We're not asking for you to change any laws. Just for a little flexibility. We'll do everything we can to help, Major. We certainly will. Thank you. Thank you, all. Detective Sergeant Ray Martin. Ah. Fred Adams, CIB. This is Major Fricks. You're gonna leave us quite a mess to clean up, aren't you, Major? Oh, I hope not. I'm sure the money we spend here will alleviate any problems that may happen. Well, we'll handle it. Don't let it worry you. I'm sure you will. I've never seen you so happy, Maisie. I've never been in a gold rush before, boys. # I'm going down to Melbourne # # To meet my sweet GI # # I want that man or else I'm sure to die # # I got soldier boy blues # # And I need my sweet GI # # He came here from America # # From the USA # # With plenty of money, plenty of things to say # # I got the solider boy blues # # And I need him here today # Patrick. US Army headquarters. This is Margot Saunders from the Civilian Entertainment Committee. Hello, ma'am. Colonel Dannenberg. Thank you for the promotion. It's Major. Oh, I'm sorry, Major. Well, I'll leave you in the capable hands of Major Dannenberg. Everything you've heard about MPs, it's true. Shall we sit? I'm afraid I'll never get American ranks right. It's all right. We have generals that can't get them right. Well I'm here about the Officer's Dance. You'll want to have our VIP list. That's next Saturday night? Yes. Well, I'm afraid that General MacArthur won't be able to make it. He'll be in Sydney but you're not supposed to know that. Oh, dear. The Lady Mayoress will be devastated. She'll get over it. There'll be enough generals to go around. How many? Nine, as of today. Throw in an admiral or two. Drop a bomb on the place, we'd shorten the war by a year. Well, Major, I must go. Well it's a great pleasure to meet you. Will you be at the dance? Yes, I think I will now. Good afternoon, Major. Good afternoon. # Now here as I lay # # In a sadly long bay # # Watching the flies on the wall # # Soon a bell will ring clear # # That I don't wish to hear # # Oh that's always part of all # # Don't knock me back # # Pal of mine # # Come and jerk in my fine # # Don't knock me back # # Have a heart # # Pal of mine # Gallo.

Put me down, you fat pig! Let me go! How'd you do? Not very good. It'll get better, Gallo, trust me. All I asked her to say was prunes. I like it here, Gallo. Booze and girls, that's what we want. Yeah! I must say you ladies certainly know how to throw a ball. I'm glad you enjoyed it. Oh, I did. I'm sorry I can't see you home but I have duty tomorrow. That's all right, I have my driver. Oh, this your car? Yes. Well. Goodnight. Margot, I want to see you again. Well, what about lunch? Lunch? Tomorrow. Lunch tomorrow. What's your number? I'm in the book. Okay. Gallo, look at this broad. Nyuk, nyuk, nyuk, nyuck. We gotta get drunk, Gallo. We gotta find a place to drink. What was the place we was at last Saturday night, Eddie? It was down on Bay Front. Victoria Hotel. Nyuk, nyuk. Boo! Jesus, Eddie, you gotta behave. Oh bullshit, shut up, Gallo! I'm having fun, jeez! Not bullshit if some MPs take a liking to us. I'm gonna show these people how to drink. Boo! Wise guy, aye? Hey look, a new movie. Spencer Tracy. I'm going to mix a drink with ketchup!

Sent. Morning, Gentlemen. What's the verdict, doc? Well, sometime between two and five this morning, rigor set in. It's hard to tell until I get her off to the table, Ray. But I'd be bloody close. Strangulation. Jesus Christ. Crushed larynx and possibly rapped. Morning, Major. Morning. Blue, get the buddy you found her over here, will you? Constable? Mr. Harmon, over here. Doc, this is Mr. Harmon, he found the body. Good morning. Mr. Harmon, this is Major Dannenberg from the United States Army. How do you do? Bloody awful on mornings like this. Sorry to hear but when exactly did you find the body? About 5:30 I'd say. I seen this Yank, though, when I was putting out the rubbish. Down there. He was bending over the body. He ran off down Victoria Avenue. It was pretty dark around five, 5:30 in the morning. How'd you know it as an American? Well, those flashy uniforms. Like Christmas trees, they look. All right, Mr. Harmon. The constable will take your statement. Well, what do you think? I'd like to have a medical report as soon as possible. Right, Major. It's a nasty one. It certainly is. But as for the witness, I don't know. It seems to me it would be... I doubt whether he could see or even recognize a uniform at that distance in the dark, let alone is obvious bias. No, I don't think he's a credible witness. But I do think we should keep it as quiet as possible until some real, positive identification is established. Good afternoon, gentlemen. Bill Fricks. Yeah, we met at your headquarters. How are you? Old and tired, Sergeant. Old and tired. Would a beer help? No thanks. It seems we've got a problem. Go on. I just got a report on my desk alleging one of our boys murdering an Australian civilian. Not much of an alligation. We've got a witness. Nasty murder. Well, I read the report. You'd have to go a long way to convince me it was one of ours. So you're saying? I'm telling. Now I want us to get along fine. We're quite capable of looking after this. So, unless you have it positive and until then my advice is lay off. What the Major is saying, although somewhat crudely, is that we realize that there is some form of cooperation that's necessary. And being professionals and reasonable men, I hope there's something we can work out. I'm reasonable too but someone strangled a woman and we're going to proceed, as per normal, of hopefully making an arrest. Surely you realize that. I can understand that. You must appreciate my position too. Bye the way, how'd you get the report so soon? I can get anything I want. That's an enviable position to be in, Major. Drop yours anytime you want. Good afternoon, gentlemen. That convinces me. It's a Yank. For some unknown reason, they're in a panic. They don't want us to get him. I've got the distinct impression this is gonna get nasty, mate. Bob, I'm trying to get supplies in here, let alone New Guinea. If what he says is true, we can't get the equipment off the docks. Let's unload the stuff ourselves for Christ sakes. Come on, we'd have a national strike on our hands. Oh, listen, there's one more thing before we go and we better make a decision on it before it gets out of hand. Now I refer to the strangling that happened last Saturday night and the alligation that it was committed by an American. Chances that it was one of ours who killed her are pretty remote. What's your recommendation? Simple. Flush it away. Chances are she didn't come across for the goods. Happened before, it's gonna happen again. All right, you gentlemen in agreement then? With all due respect, I don't agree. This woman was badly beaten, stripped stark naked and then strangled. But there's motivation. She wasn't robbed, she wasn't raped and there is a distinct possibility that one of our men did do it. Look at this. Now this is no ordinary crime. Point taken, Major. How did you manage to find an orchid in water? The advantages of having an air corp. At least, what's left of it. Is there anything you people can't get hold of? Well, with the acception of the Emperor of Japan, not much. And maybe with your help and your diggers, we might even be able to do that. We're doing our best in New Guinea. Yes, I know you are. So, tell me, how does a policeman become head of morale? There is a logic there. Who better than a cop? After all, there is a war to be fought behind the lines as well. Did you enlist? I was in the reserves. I got a subtly worded letter from the president and here we are. Well the ladies of the city certainly appreciate your company. With the exception of one, I'm afraid. One of our boys may have strangled one of your girls. How awful. We're trying to keep it as quiet as we possibly can. I'm only telling you this because if you hear any more about it, I just want you to know that it isn't me. Would you like some more coffee? Yes, please. Don't miss this movie happening tonight. Mickey Mouse in "Fantasia." Any news, Eddie? Yeah. Damn fool brother landed in the can again. I was worried about my mom. It'll be okay, Eddie. I know these things. Eddie. Eddie, you don't wanna worry about these things. There's people at home to look after this stuff. Welfare people. I don't know, Gallo. I just don't know. Eddie, look, you on duty tonight? No. I got it done this morning. We'll go into town. We'll have fun like we did last night. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah! We'll go into town. Get drunk, get some girls. Boy, we got drunk last night, didn't we Gallo? Let's show these Aussies I can drink. I can drink better than anyone! I feel great! Okay, Eddie. I'll take care of you, Gallo. I'll get you a girl too. Okay? Let's go, yeah! They don't want any shit dropping on their shiny new image, I can understand that. Yeah, so can I but I'm a copper. Whether they like it or not. I want the bugger that did it. You're right, Blue. We work for shit money and no bugger really likes us. Might as well enjoy ourself in our own quiet little way, aye? Besides, they poisoned Phar Lap, didn't they? Now I've really got the shits with them. Woo! Woo! Woo! Boo! Woo! Woo! I'm gonna get on the bar! Woo! Yeah! Sergeant Rothberger, sir. At ease, Sergeant. What's going on upstairs? Just some crazy GI walking on his hands on the bar, sir. Just having fun, sir. Well don't let it get out of hand, Sergeant. Yeah! Jeez, Eddie, that was fantastic! Ow! Gallo! Jesus, you are a crazy son of a bitch. Hello. Hi. Are you all right? Yeah, I think so. May I sit down? Yeah, sure. Thank you. How long have you been in Australia? Since February. Enjoying it? Yeah. Good. Hey, listen, would you like to get something stronger to drink? Yeah, why not? Okay. Did you enjoy your meal? Yes, beautiful. I'll pretend that you're referring to me. Oh, I am. I mean, both. You come out on top. I'm flattered. And you're stark naked under that dress. There's no hiding nothing from you, mister, is there? You can say that again. Who are these people? My family. That's my brother, Doug. He's a prisoner of the Japanese. He was on the Pert when it sunk. And the other one? That's my fiance. It's been six months now since we heard he was shot down over somewhere called Saint-Lazare. Oh, I'm very sorry. He was a wonderful man. But I wouldn't have married him. Really, why not? Oh, lots of reasons. Main one being the fact that I don't love him. Yet you were engaged with him? I'm afraid that's what we do here. Old money marries old money. Then we have children, most of whom are spoiled idiots and we're seen smiling painfully from social pages forever after. Well, you didn't turn out too badly. And we don't get involved with foreigners. Oh. Especially foreign policemen. I'm not a foreigner. I'm an American. Just another one of the many men in your life. Well, been one or two. Really? I do seem to remember this rather dirty little boy. Dirty little boy? At school. I sports afternoons he used to walk me home. And he'd try to put his hand up my dress. Disgraceful. That's what I thought. What did you do? Well, I let him. You let him? Well, of course. And you know something else? What? I liked it. I bet you did. You have a lovely smile, Eddie. But underneath, I believe you're vicious. Nah, nah. I'd never hurt anyone. People just think that because I'm big. You've got a good body. Thanks. So do you. Do you miss your home much? Yeah. I miss my mom. Can you sing? All right. You. Step forward. Your mother know you're out? No, shit. All right, step back. You. Step forward. What's your name? Franklin D. Roosevelt? Jim Smith. I believe it. Where'd you get the suit? Sister's boyfriend. He's a Yank. Does he know you've got it? Yes sir, he gave it to me. Said it's the only way I can get a girl. Christ almighty. All right, step back. Number four, step forward. You! Quick! Name. Philip Raymond. 1930, break and enter. 1931, entering a dwelling with intent. 1934, assault. 1935, indecent exposure. Nice one, Raymond. Very nice. I was fitted. Bullshit, shut up! 1940, suspicion of armed rob. Not proven, Adams. It was to me! And you call me Mr. Adams! Otherwise, you'll go down the stairs, pal. And all the way up again, pal. You live here? Yes. May I come in? No. Everybody's asleep. How about Friday? I've gotta go in, Eddie. Please sing for me again. Don't be so silly. I really like your voice. Sing some more for me. It's really pretty. Sing for me. I want your voice. Sing for me! I want your voice. I want your voice, give me your voice. Give me your voice! Sing for me! Right. What were you two dirty buggers up to last Saturday night? I was at home. You've been warned, Billy. Shit. Been another strangling, Blue. Same as last time. They've just found a second body, General. Yes, he's here. Wait, please. Hello? Yes, Tony? Oh, Jesus Christ. Where's Fricks? Well see if you can't find out where he is, we'll pick him up. Yeah, pick me up in 10 minutes. As soon as you can, then. Yeah. What's wrong? Remember when I told you about that girl that was strangled? Yes, have they caught the killer? No, another girl's been killed. Well, well. Hello, Maisie. Welcome to your home away from home, Major. Thank you, listen, I'm looking for Major Fricks. Is he here? Can't get him out of the place. Come on, I'll get him for you. Follow me. I see him, thank you. Major? Yeah, what is it? Say goodnight, sweetie pie. Daddy's gotta go to work. There's been another murder. So what? It's one of ours. What? One of our boys has been murdered? One of our boys did it. Are you sure, Pat? The local police have identified the victim. Turns out that she was the wife of a cop seen out with this GI. What's their mood like? Well they're pissed off, naturally. They want our blood. But then again, so does his whole inner soul. Oh, shit. Well, majors, this may come as a surprise to you but I get little enough sleep overnight without being woken up at six o'clock in the morning after a long night's work in order to mind your shop. Now why isn't your staff on duty? Gave them Sunday night off, sir. Yes, well, you and yours can put away your dancing pumps and your party hats. From now on, every waking moment of yours will be expended on getting this lunatic, whoever he is, behind bars because if we don't, majors, we may as well call it quits here. Now you'll be working hand in glove with these gentlemen here, until we have him. The papers have already got hold of it and I can guarantee as of today that it won't be worth piss being a GI on the streets of this town. I want you to keep this down, out of the papers as much as possible. You understand? Yes, sir. I don't want this to turn ugly. And we're gonna need your help. Well, anything to add? No. No. "We don't want this to turn ugly." "We are gonna need your help." Bull shit. That bastard's gonna tell me what to do in me own town. Bull shit! No doubt in my mind, at least, that both these women have been killed by the same person. Uh huh. Neither has been raped but their larynges both have been crushed. Now this type of murder is unusual because of the amount of damage done to the throat. I'd say the killing was affected by a very, very strong individual, indeed. No rape, no robbery and no motive. What the hell could he be after? I don't know, Major. Eddie, what're you doing? Gallo! Gallo, you know about werewolves? What're you talking about? Jekyll and Hyde, just like in the movie! That's me! The movie? You know those murders? Those girls that were murdered? What murders? I know I killed them. Have you been drinking again? Eddie. Eddie, we'll go into town and we'll get drunk and you can walk on your hands. Eddie! Yeah! We'll go into town, yeah. Have some fun, get some girls, okay, yeah. Yeah, that's it, yeah! Yeah. # I got a fella in the Air Force # # An man in the Marines # # I got one in the Navy that I've never seen # # You're my GI # # You're my GI boy # # I got the soldier boy blue and I need my sweet GI # # A brand new stripped suit # # A captain's swag # # Caught myself a GI, I won't kiss and tell # # I need that GI, need that GI boy # Maybe you need a gun for peace. You're brave enough to strangle a few more of our girls? We don't want any trouble. We're here to fight the Japs, not you. Okay, then fight the Japs! No, boofhead! We're the ones fighting the Japs. You pisswit poof! There's no way to be certain whether there's any real fighting. You're fucking dead, boy! Oh my God! Captain! Break it up! Hey, come on, break it up! Break it up! Break it up, you guys! Break it up, you guys! Come on, what's the matter with you?! 30 beers! Ow! You can drink, honey. Woo! What're you doing? I'm getting ready. Get dressed. Please, sing for me. Get dressed and go, please. I'm not that sort of girl. Please sing for me. Just go. Sing for me or I'll kill you, just like I did those two girls. I'll scream if you don't go! Okay. I'm just playing, having fun. I like to drink. By, darling. If you two majors don't pull your finger out and find this block, this'll go on every night. Second strangling! Read all about it! I'm telling you, it's the wrath of God! While our brave young boys are up there fighting in New Guinea, these lecturers, these Americans, these murderers are walking our streets, defiling our most treasured possession, our women. Now, they're evil. They're corrupt. They're not our saviors. We'd be better off under the bloody Japs. Australia won't be the same until the Yanks go home. Where you been, Yanks?! We've been fighting for two bloody years! We'll get to Tokyo before you, Diggers! Have a good time in New Guinea, Aussies! We've come to save your ass, Aussie. She's never gonna wanna see you again after she's swung off the end of my prick. Bastards! Cease fire! Cease fire! Cease fire! How many are dead? About 30, sir, and climbing. What the bloody hell are you lot doing? Sergeant! Get these men sorted out! Yes, sir. Yes, sir, I will. I'll do my best. I don't give a shit what. The ambulances are mine. If I don't get my men in that hospital in 10 minutes, Lieutenant, you'll be under arrest! - On whose fucking authority?! - Gentlemen! Who the hell are you? I'm your superior, now take your hands out of your pocket. Who's your commanding officer? Captain Maitland. You go get him and bring him back here right now. Those son of bitches opened up... At ease, Captain, I can see what happened. These are your orders and you will follow them without question. You'll continue to carry all dead and wounded on company roster until notified to do differently. You will continued to be paid. All incoming mailed will be held. All outgoing mail will be censored. The wounded will be taken to the nearest field hospital, they'll be treated in a sealed ward under guard and no one leaves unless he has a pass signed by me. - Sergeant. - Yes, sir? Will you get that man with the camera? Bring him over here. Yes, sir. And take that film out of it. And Captain, this incident never happened. Last night I believed you had cause to attend a number of incidents, brawls and so on, involving our troops and both Australian and civilians and service personnel. You know the cause of these incident? The strangling, sir. Yes, yes, I suspected as much. We've already had abusive phone calls. All right, now listen, we've got a war to win and a reputation to establish in this country and we are in deep trouble and we want it fixed. Sir? We have to make an example. You get us someone to hang. Every women in this city is afraid of every American serviceman. I cannot expect my troops to fight for me if they have no moral and if they're fighting for people who hate and suspect them. It's obvious we're dealing with a maniac and so the last thing I want is for him to be apprehended by the local police and be confined to an institution. See, under Australian law, he might not hang. You both understand that, of course. Yes, sir. All right, well I emphasize the strict secrecy of this matter. It has been arranged at the highest level that it will come under our jurisdiction. So it is us who must get him. What's the matter with you? Give us someone to hang? If that's what he wants, that's what he gets. Excuse me. Excuse me. Can you tell me the right tram to take back to camp? Why are you following me? Because I want your voice. What? I want your voice. Sing for me. Please sing for me. I want your voice. Ah, shit. You all right, solider? Yeah, I'm fine. Got a light? Yeah, I have. Out a bit late, aren't you, soldier? Got on the wrong tram. You shouldn't have too long to wait on the next one. Yeah. I'm gonna walk home. Goodnight. Goodnight. I've seen some fucking shambles in my time but this one's gold plated. He tries to strangle one girl, flashes dick at another of the poor buggers. We know his name's Eddie and you graciously walk the streets lighting his cigarette not two minutes after he's frightened Christ out of some kid! And not one of you can put a face to the bastard! Look, mate, I'm going to the dives. You never know. The Yanks have offered us a lineup. We'll take two girls with us. Any luck, we might turn up something. All right, get out there. And this time, get off your fucking asses! Oh my God, police. You're lucky the MPs never caught you. Ah. Going out tonight with all leave canceled. Oh, bullshit, Gallo. Eddie? Did you really kill those girls? Nah, I was just fooling, Gallo. Eddie? If you did kill them, you could get out of it. Yeah, how would I do that? You can say you was insane. They don't do nothing to you if you're insane. Forget it. Did you kill 'em, Eddie? Forget it, Gallo. I gotta get some sleep. I'm going into town tomorrow. Get some girls. Yeah. I gotta take a leak. Wear your coat. It's cold out there. Yeah, yeah. Sure, Eddie. Talk to you later, Gallo. Waste of time. Attention camp, attention camp! Still further notice, all leave has been canceled. Repeat, all leave has been canceled. Morning, Sergeant. Ladies. This looks like the end of the trail, Gallo. All yours, Sergeant. Thanks, Major. Now if you recognize anybody, let me know. After you, ladies. You really had me worried there for a minute. Major. Thanks for the cooperation. Goodbye. And thank you, ladies. Sergeant, see that the ladies get home. Good evening, gentlemen. Major. Hell of a place to meet. It is a bit lonely. But I don't think anybody's gonna put their hand up your skirt, Sergeant. I'd settle for a passionate kiss. Oh. What the fuck's going on?! What do you mean? Half the bastards we saw at the lineup were on duty the night of the killings. You setting us up? No, why should we do that? Stop us making the arrest. We want that bastard caught just as badly as you do. Bullshit. Don't you understand? It doesn't matter who catches anyone. We need an example. We have to restore our credibility here and he's the General's boy and there's not a goddamn thing that you or I or anybody else can do about it. He's gonna be caught, tired and hung by us. But these are crimes committed again Australian citizens in Australia! He's gotta come under civil jurisdiction. No, no. See, under ordinary circumstances, that would be true. But it's been arranged at the very highest level. We have to hang him. It's what they call "cooperation." This bugger's dying to get arrested. Could be our strangler, mate. So this is him? Could be. He's a big bugger, isn't he? He's a cheeky bugger too. He's been grinning at us. No PC rules. We don't we identify him. He's their outfit. I seen him in a car with them. Good idea. Has he been here all night? Watch it, mate. Hey. Bye, guys. The bastard's gone. He's short throwing us. Go after him! Look after these two bastards. Bugger. We fucking lost him, mate. Think it was him? It was him all right. Buggered him, Blue. Oh, shit! Bye the way, thanks for the hand inside there. That's all right, mate. You'd do the same for me. Excuse me, ma'am. Yes? Can I help you? Yes, ma'am, I seem to have lost my way. Could you show me the closest entrance to the camp? Camp Pell? Yes, ma'am, Camp Pell. I live near there. May I walk with you? Yeah, if you want to. You can share my umbrella, if you like. May I hold it for you, ma'am? Thank you. Where are you from? New York, ma'am. Wish I was there. Yes, it must be lonely for you boys sometimes. Yes, ma'am. Thanks for walking with me. Oh, it's all right. Well, this is as far as I go. I live around the next street. Area A is where? I'll show you. Thank you. Well, it must be hard for you. To lose your way. Yeah. You're nice. Now, see? It's just through there. I like your voice. What? Sing for me. Sing for me. Sing for me! Sing! I want your voice! What happened to you, buddy? I fell in some mud. You'll wanna get those clothes off you before you catch a cold, pal. Take a shower. Nah. I'm going to sleep. Have it your way, pal.

Got a problem, Private? Sir, it's about those girls who were killed, sir. Yes. Sir, Private Leonski keeps saying he knows about him. He says he killed. I thought he was just mouthing off, sir, but last night he comes in crying, all covered in mud. What exactly did he say? Sir, he says he's a werewolf and he killed those girls. Where is he now? Washing some clothes, sir. The ones with the mud on them. Get the guard, Commander. Tell him to bring an escort. Gallo, you come with me. Private Leonski? Yes, sir. You are under arrest. For what, sir? Suspicion of murder. Take him to my office. Poor bugger. And we nearly had him. We had him, mate. I got him. I just arrested him. I got him. Wanna come see him? Morning, gentlemen. Major. Gentlemen, Private Leonski. Those women. Did you kill them? Yes. I'm glad it's over, aren't you? Why did you kill those women? I don't know. I only wanted their voices. I'm asking you to be my assistant in the Leonski defense because you're familiar with the details and because of your legal background. I'm also part of the arresting and investigating team. Is there some kind of conflict there? Not in this case, Major. Oh? In fact, it will prove useful. They're gonna hang him, you know? Major, the oath we took as lawyers demands that it is our duty to see that he get a fair and proper trial. Yes but does that supersede military command? I believe it does. You mean that you are willing to go all the way with this no matter what? Yes. All right, Colonel. Major. Jesus, what a family. He was one of four brothers and one sister. One brother's in the penitentiary. Another brother's a thief. The third brother was drafted but in a mental hospital now. His sister seems to be the only one who's normal. The mother, father and step-father are all chronic alcoholics. What do you think of women, Eddie? Do you like them? I like girls a lot. Especially their voices. They got nice voices. Have you had many girls, Eddie? I had a few at home. Did you have sexual intercourse with the girls you killed? Do you masterbate, Eddie? No, sir. Do you like singing, Eddie? Yeah, I like singing a lot. I like to sing. You wanna hear me sing? If you like, Eddie. # It's a lovely day, tomorrow # # Tomorrow is a lovely day # # Come and feast your tear dimmed eyes # # On tomorrow's pale blue skies # # Though today you're sad and lonely # # And every little thing looks gray # # Just forget your troubles and learn to say # # Tomorrow is a lovely day # Having some fun now. Bolt it, Sergeant. Well, what do you think? I don't think he's insane. What about that singing, his voice? Doesn't make any difference, Major. Even if it was soprano. Private Leonski, after examination by members of the United States Medical Crop, it is found that you are sane and fit to stand trial by general court martial. You are aware of the charges made against you under Article 92 of the Articles of War? Yes, sir. To all specifications and to the charges of murder, how do you plead? To all the speciations and the charges of murder, we please not guilty. Wait a moment, Major. You get everything up there you can. Most of all, construction crews. Every fighter you can get in the air, okay. Yes, sir. The consulate's been bombed. The Japs have been over it for two hours. Jesus Christ. Yes, he'd be a great help if he could fly a Kitty Hawk. You're assisting Spencer Eddie on that Leonski, aren't you? Yes, sir, I am. Yeah, well he's gone and got himself some disease. Hepatitis, I think. You take over. What? You take over. You defend him. Sir, I can't do that I don't have the kind of experience that's necessary to try a murder trial. You know that case, that'll be an advantage and that is all, Major. But. It is true, then? Yes. The chief council has hepatitis. I've been ordered to take over the case. How can you defend that beast? I don't know. It's my dilemma but he's not a beast, Margot. He's a large powerful man. Simple. He has a kind of ere of innocence. My God, Patrick, he killed three women for no reason and you're talking about an ere of innocence? No, he had a reason. You know what his motive was? He wanted their voices. Voices? Yeah. Here it is, mate. Parallel after parallel. Shear bloody genius, Blue. Souderman. I forgot all about him. The same, mate. Exactly the bloody same. Souderman, Leonski. Both lunatics. More than coincidence. # I love my baby # # But she don't love me # # I love my baby # # But she don't love me # # And she gave me some bundle bird # # She's got me climbing up a tree # # Up a tree, up a tree # Hey, you play really good, man. Where did you learn the blues? Fats Waller. Fats Waller? Yeah, he knew the blues. You don't happen to know "the I've Got General MacArthur in Australia Blues," do you? No but I know all about the "Arnold Souderman Blues." Oh yeah, how does that go? Arnold Souderman was a bloke we hung in Melbourne a few years ago. Mad as a snake, the poor bugger. He strangled four little girls. You wanna know his motives? Yeah. He liked their voices. Jesus Christ, no. When he committed all those crimes, he had been drinking heavily. The autopsy showed that he had what's known as Leptomeningitis. Leptomeningitis? What's that? It's an obscure disease of the brain brought on by excessive drinking. It produces loss of memory and manic violence. A coincidence, huh? Well, we thought it might help the poor mad bugger. We get paid for arresting him. Not hanging him. It wouldn't matter whether he was organically, psychologically or genetically insane, they're satisfied with the medical report. He's legally sane. You could show that it was not premeditated. Yeah, I could try that. Anyway, thank you, gentlemen. No worries. It's called cooperation, mate. Now could there have been premeditation on the part of the defendant? Objection. Premeditation was not within the scope of the medical examination. Sustained. Well could there have been premeditation? Objection. Sustained. Could there have been intent? Objection. Same question. Sustained. Doctor, what is your opinion on the question of premeditation and intent? Objection. Sustained. You say sometimes his voice changed. What did you mean by that exactly? Sometimes he would sing with a girl's voice? Was this like another person's voice completely? Objection. Sustained. The defense now raises, in the strongest possible terms, the objection to the non-admittance and the non-acceptance of evidence concerning the sanity of the accused and the premeditation of the crimes. Major, it will not have escaped your notice, I'm sure, that an extensive examination of the accused was conducted by highly qualified members of the Medical Corp. The court is satisfied with those findings. If the court is satisfied with the examination and its conduct then your objection is not sustained. All three doctors, trained in that science, say in that report, "We are of the opinion that the accused "has never been insane. "Was not insane at the time the act was committed "and is not now insane." They also say, however, that he is a psychopathic case but without psychosis. He's not normal and that he also possesses certain emotional instability. Anyone who goes out and strangles three women will possess emotional instability. Baby Face Nelson, Machine Gun Kelly possessed emotional instability. Every murderer possesses emotional instability. Leonski was legally sane. He knew the difference between right and wrong. I think, probably, that in no other court would it be possible for all the expert, on any subject, to agree as to the same conclusion. I'm sure that any murder case tried in the US, there would be experts on each side who would swear themselves blue in the face completely contradicting each other as to what the observed and as to what the conclusions were. Now I have difficulty letting go of this subject because I feel a responsibility as I am sure the court does. Are you satisfied, beyond a reasonable doubt, or is this one of those issues which is confused? Now gentlemen, in closing, the 90 second article of war states that the penalty for murder shall be one of two things. Death or life imprisonment. I'm fully conscious of the awful responsibility of saying that a human being has forfeited his right to live. But I do say to you, and I say it in all humility, that Edward J. Leonski by the fiendish, atrocious quality of these three crimes has forfeited his right to continue to live. I object most strongly with the admission of circumstantial evidentiary procedure. A policy, which has, I believe risen to a bizarre level and will seriously prejudice the conduct of American Military Justice in respect of this court martial. I caution you, Major. It is not a right of justice, military or otherwise, to criticize the court. I'm sure that our relation with the people here, if that question should in the slightest degree come intruding in out thoughts, be far more improved with the feeling that we have done justice as we saw it under the principles of our common law. I submit, gentlemen, that this is one of those cases where there are so many missing keys to the puzzle that we shall probably never know what actually happened or the extent of his guilt, if any. So now I ask the court what I know we shall receive, your consideration of one question and one question alone. Which is the guilt or innocence beyond a reasonable doubt of this man and the determination of penalty which should come to him beyond a reasonable doubt, so that if some time, the still early hours of the morning, when we're alone, alone except for our thoughts, that we will have no doubt come intruding but that we will have done justice to this man. Sir, if this man does not hang, if he is institutionalized, then his confinement will be seen as no more than the United States Army taking care of one of its own. Attention! This court martial is now in session. The accused will rise. Patrick, please take my hand. Private Leonski, it is my duty as president of this court to inform you that the court enclosed session and upon secret written ballot, three-fourths of the members present at the time the vote was taken, concurring at each finding of guilty, finds you of all specifications in the charge guilty and again, in closed session and upon secret written ballot, all of the members present at the time the vote was taken sentence you to be hanged by the neck until dead. Thank you, Patrick. Can I help you, Major? Yes, I'd like to send a cable, please. Yes, sir. Take this down for me? Sure. "To the Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court." Well, I'll need the letter for confirmation and your authorization could take some time, sir. The authorization? Yes, sir. Have you tried the telephone? No, I haven't tried the telephone. Listen, Captain, I want a line to Washington D.C. right now! Do you understand? Right now! Sir, if I could give you one, I'd give you one. We haven't had one for two days. - Hello. - Yes. I would like to send this airmail, special delivery. I'm sorry but you'll have to use US facilities. We're not authorized to accept such mail. Why not? It's personal. Major, you know we're not allowed to send military communications personal or otherwise. This is a civilian service only. Can you help me then? Yes, sir. Right away, sir. We'll have to patch a telegram through the civilian, so it may take an hour, sir. All right, give me... I have to give you full martial invention, Patrick. What the hell do you think you're doing? You're the worst fucking loser I ever saw. Trialing to appeal to the Supreme Court on a military matter? They ain't never gonna allow you to do that. You really got your ass in a jam this time. MacArthur? Mhmm. The question without notice! His honorable, the Prime Minister. In the matter of jurisdiction in the case of Private Edward Leonski, who has alleged to have committed several murders in Melbourne in May of this year. Why is it that we have broken precedent by allowing a military tribunal to try a citizen of a foreign country for civil crimes against Australian citizens and why has the government agreed that the accused should be tried under the laws of his own country?! Order! Order! I suppose the members of the opposition would be happy if Australian troops in Egypt were subject to Egyptian law? Order! The House will come to order! Look, I want you to help me. I have to get this information the US Supreme Court. Now they've stopped me every time I've tried. They've blocked my way. Maybe you'll have better luck. Well, I can try. What is it? It's a request for a writ of certiorari. What's that? Well it's many things but what it will do it halt all procedures. It will stop Leonski's execution. What? No. It's finished. It's over. Look, he did it. He murdered three women, for God sake, Patrick. He's got to hang. He's insane, Margot. Now there's more to this than a motion. It has to do with principles of a law. What sort of principles justify random murder? Exactly. What sort of principle? How could we justify killing an insane man? Now you come from a world where you've never seen any of this. You hear about it but you've never any of it. I have. You can't just go around hanging people because some general thinks the public demands it. In America, everyone has the right to due process. In America. Not just because it's politically expedient does it make it right to kill Leonski. In the name of God, Patrick, who cares? He's no loss. To you, to me, to anyone. He's a vicious, brutal murderer. Don't be foolish enough to compromise your career for him. The court says he normal. But he's not. He's not, Margot. He's suffering from a condition that, under ordinary circumstances, he would never be brought to trial. Now if we allow this to happen without protest, we're nothing more than judicially Leonski's killers. Nazis! That's what the Nazis do, isn't it? We're supposed to be fighting this war for civilization. The laws, the rules, the principles. We can't just set aside the law to fight a war. To protect the law that we're breaking. Margot, it's not just for Leonski. You see, it's for all of us. Send it, please. Major. I got your message. What can I do for you, Sergeant? Two beers please. Why? You mean Leonski? Sergeant, I can believe anything except you know why. He never struck me as being naive. For my own curiosity, why? We either hang the poor bastard or we go home. Simple as that, huh? I don't believe that for one minute. What the hell do you think you're dealing with here? This isn't the Salvation Army, this is the United States Army and let me tell you this, Douglas MacArthur is the closest thing this town is ever gonna see to God! Go right in, sir. The General is expecting you. General Montgomery, army commander, as saying at a press conference, "Our army has now gone in to destroy the enemy completely." General, this is Major Dannenberg. I won't try and run away. It's regulations, Private Leonski. You understand. Yeah. It's okay. "The House of the Lord forever." Won't be long now. Like a smoke? No. It's bad for my health. Would you like some time to yourself? I'd appreciate it if you leave the padre with me. Sure. Father, would you bless me, please? Of course. The name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost. Amen. Would you give this to Major Dannenberg for me, please? Thanks. Goodbye. This is the end of a long trail. Thanks for all your training did for me. I won't forget it. We have a war to win. Do you understand? Yes, sir, I do. Do you have anything to say before sentence is carried out? It's just as well, isn't it? Sorry, Eddie. It's okay. Our Father, Who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. Colonel. Thank you, sir. I'm sorry, Patrick. No, it's all right. I just couldn't get the letter off in time. It was too late to save him anyway. Thank you. Thank you, Margot. He won't be forgotten. I'll see to that. Look. He sent me this before they hanged him. "I'll be back in a year."
