( music playing ) Brevard County's a very conservative area. Trump City, to be exact. About 18, 19 months ago, a veteran soldier who was suffering from PTSD was killed in the jailhouse and Sheriff Wayne Ivey and the police who were policing themselves refuse to release the videos. And that's what people are so outraged about is release the videos. Just release the videos so that the family can see what happened. And I'm gonna stop because I get so emotional when I think about it because I've had two brothers-- not one, but two brothers die in police custody. Unarmed black men. Tall, skinny. But apparently they felt threatened by my brothers and killed them. For no reason. ( chanting ) Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Make this nation a better nation. - Breonna Taylor! - Say her name!

If you've got that, all's well with the world. Man: A year and a half ago, we had a bunch of trees back of our house and a construction company knocked them all down. In their wake, they left a giant hole. As you can see, it is now a very moderate size pond. I... I want to have kids so bad. I want to have kids more than just about anything. I want them to grow up in a world that's kind. And I know people laugh at that, and they call you a vulnerable snowflake and an idealist. But I always come back to the question, "Why?" Man: So here it is. What was once trees is now water. I understand that it's complex, but at the same time, it's really simple. Man: Enjoy your kayaking adventure. - I shall. I love you. - I love you, too. Why can't we change? Why can't we be kind? ( music playing ) Man: Just one last thought from the Bible. Before I go to bed at night, I like to look at this. Here in the Book of Luke, chapter 21, verse 11, it says, "There will be great earthquakes, and in one place after another food shortages and pestilences, and there will be fearful sights and from heaven, great signs."
