And then we want our money in full. After that there's no more fucking chances, no more excuses. You understand? - I understand. - Good. Now, you take this, as a little reminder about... go on take it... of how close you came. Next time, you get one in your nut. All right? Good boy. You lucky twat! Don't forget to write to me, mate. See ya later Billy boy. See ya later, brother. Danny, I need one minute. Yeah. Tommy, come here. I do not wanna hear about you being back here, do you understand me? Yeah, of course. - Eddie Franks, yeah? - Yeah, the one and only. Check that please. Thanks for everything, Ed. I really appreciate it. You take care of yourself, boy. You could have charged that. All right, sign here. This gives me so much pleasure, I cannot tell you. Eddie Franks, you're free to go. Thank you very much! See you later. Don't worry, we'll keep your bed nice and warm for you, eh? No mate, there's only one geezer here doing a life sentence, and that ain't me. Oh, and by the way, don't be late for work tomorrow, yeah? Listen, I'm winding you up. Look after that family, Danny. Yeah. Here he is. - What took you so long? - There he is! Been out here waiting ten years! Welcome home, bruv. - So good to see ya. - Yeah, likewise, likewise. You done a bit of weight? You put it on, didn't ya? You cheeky fucker! What happened to your face? Oh, nothing. I had a run-in with some pisshead in the pub the other night. He come off worse, believe me! So, here she is. The old girl! Well, she's hanging in there, Sean, eh? Sure is. I've hardly touched it to be honest. Too scared in case I took a knock. Not worth the ag? Is it? You know that. Here we are, do the honors. Actually, do you mind if I don't? Come on then, lively, jump in, before they change their mind and throw you back inside! Where do you wanna go first then? I need a drink, do you know what I mean? Rik? Rik, this is Eddie. Ed, this is Rikki. Hello babe, nice to meet ya. Yeah, same. - What, is that it? - What? You're not even gonna get up and say hello properly? Babe, I just said hello. You're fucking rude, you are. And what do you want me to do? - Sean, just leave it, mate. - Look at the state of this place. - You could have at least tidied up a little bit. - What? Most of it's your fucking mess. I'm not your skivvy. At least let some light in, for fuck's sake. She sleeps all day and stays up all night. It's like living with a fucking vampire. - Now fuck off, yeah? - It's disgusting. Just make sure you're on time later. Come on, I'll show you the room. It's not much, I know. But it'll do until we get the pub flat sorted. I've hung some of your gear up in the wardrobe, and the rest of it's in those bags. I got you a few other little bits and pieces as well. Hope you like 'em. Put away your shit quickly and we'll slip, eh? Oi... It's really good to have you here, bruv. I mean it. Oi, please don't embarrass me in front of my brother, - I'm begging ya. - What are you on about? Just make an effort. It's all I ask. - Okay. - Thank you! Oi, just give me a bump. - I ain't got nothing. - Don't lie. Come on, just give me one. - I ain't got nothing! - Oh, come on. Please, babe! Just a little one, all right? Don't take the piss, that's all I've got. Hurry up! Gimme a little, will ya? Getting it everywhere, what are you doing? - Shut up. - Fuck's sake! Do it off me then. Fuckin' matter with you? I'm gonna see ya later, all right? Am I all right? You look hot. Don't fuckin' start with that. See ya later. Fuckin' eat something. She's all right once you get to know her. I mean, I didn't even bloody like her at first when I first met her. She puts on this, like, hard front. But once you get past that... You sure this is the right address? Yeah, 100 percent. Why? What do you wanna do? I dunno, let's just go. Thank God for that. Come on. You all right, Jim? Got a nice color there, mate. Right. Eddie! - Jeany, baby! - Oh! How are ya? You all right? All the better for seeing you, love! Oh! You look fantastic. Well, funny enough, I was thinking exactly the same thing about you. 'Cause I'm standing in there, looking at you in this lovely light, and you ain't changed one bit since the last time I seen you. You have to love him, your brother. Always was a brilliant liar! Oh! It's nice to have you back, Ed. I mean it. - Welcome home, boy. - Thanks, Jean. Oh, Dave, hang on a minute, love. Coming. - All right, love, IPA? - Yeah, thanks. I thought you said you decorated the place? I did, about four years ago. Even gave Jean a lick o' paint. Fuckin' state of it, though, Sean. I done me best. It's been a struggle, especially the last couple of years. We're lucky to still be up and running. So how's the flat looking? After the boiler flooded, the damp set in, and everything just started rotting. Then the electrics went, and that was it. Just one thing after the other, Ed. I just ain't had the dough. Well, I'm here now, aren't I? Anyway, look, don't worry for now. You're home! We should be celebrating, shouldn't we? Come on. Yeah, listen, I need a little quick piss first. Please tell me that toilet still works? - Yeah, 'course. - Large G and T, plenty of ice and lemon. - I'll catch you up. - Gotcha. Where'd you get books from? The geezer comes round. He's got a little mini library. - Wow! - Went right through 'em. - Free? - Yeah, ain't gotta pay him. Who you gonna pay? Come on, Rik, hurry up! Oi, oi! No touching! - What do you think you're doing? - What? - You fucking know. - What? Come on, Rik, you fucking know. Oh, don't start all that paranoid shit again. Paranoid, I'm not fucking paranoid, am I? You was rubbing up and down on his cock. - I just watched you with me own eyes! - It's part of the fucking show! It's not part of the show, is it? You're supposed to dance, not reef up the fucking customers! You know the score, Sean. If you're not happy, fuck off! - Hello, Fred! - All right, lad. You all right, mate? What can I get ya? Get us a bottle of champagne and two glasses, will ya? We're celebrating. Marky boy got a "not guilty" yesterday, didn't you, son? - 'Course I fucking did. - Did ya? Congratulations, mate. Good to have ya back, lad. Don't know what I would've done without ya, mate. You're my right hand man, lad. See the face on them in that court? Hey, told you I was gonna fuckin' bust out. The fuck's this shit, lad? It's 87.50 but call it 85, go on. All right? Put it on the tab, you dickhead. Yeah, of course. Hey, I'll fucking show this little twat. Come on you... Sean. Who's the Scouse geezer? Oh, that's, um, that's Freddie Bagshott. He's one of our regulars. He works with Roy and Jonny Garrett. Jean! Jean, come on, the music. All right. Here, got you a little present. You're gonna like this one. No, Jean. Listen, what I'm trying to say to you is, - it says here there was ten kegs delivered, paid for. - Yeah. But there's a bill here saying: "This is very serious, do not ignore." - Jean! Jean! - "Six months late." Was it paid for? No. Yeah, I'm coming, all right. - I'm going to the toilet. - No. Hey Mickey, how are ya, love? You all right? Standing there like a space man! In the bag, eating all that every five seconds. I mean, fuckin' hell, you're like a hoover, you cunt. Fuckin' hell, Ed! - What's wrong? - So that's where all our money's been goin', is it? - Up your fucking nose? - What are you talking about? No. - You do know we're 15 grand in debt? - Yeah, and I told you we was in trouble, didn't I? I've been trying to keep us fucking afloat. That's absolute bollocks, I'm not having that, Sean. The reason we've got no money and we're in fucking trouble, is because you ain't been paying the fucking bills, that's why. - No. - How much that geezer out there owe on his tab? - What geezer? - The fucking Freddie geezer you keep creaming up? I told ya, he works for Roy and Jonny! And I don't give a fuck. How much does he owe? - How much? - About 800. Ed, Ed, no! Don't, mate. He's heavy. Get your hand off me, Sean. You were like, "Mate, it's you!" Excuse me, fellas. We've not met, I'm Eddie. I'm Sean's brother. I'm actually the owner of this place. My lovely brother Sean's been looking after it for me while I've been away. And, look, I hate saying this but he's just informed me that you owe a substantial amount on your bar bill, is that correct? Oh, do we now? Why, is that a problem? Well, Sean being Sean, he should never have let you run up a bill that big. So from now on, and in the future, there's gonna be no more credit in here. Is that okay? Okay, no problem. Thing is, the money that you do owe, from the bill that's outstanding, has got to be paid tonight. Do what? Look, come over to the bar with me, we'll settle it up, and you two can have a... Well, carry on with a lovely evening. I'll tell you what, I might come over when I'm finished. See how I feel, eh? Please, look, I need you to come over there now, please. Or what? Exactly. So why don't you fucking do one over there with your little rat brother, eh? Before you get hurt. And I'll come over after if I feel like it. Get us another couple of brandies as well while you're at it. Yeah, put them on the tab. Go on, cunt, what you waiting for? It's that cheeky bastard. Who does he think he is? What's the matter, cunt? Did I stutter before? There's gonna be a comeback after this, you know that, don't you? Look, I'm sorry, mate. I'm sorry. I really am. I just... Do you know who you just fucked with, you cunt? I just went and lost it. But don't you understand, Ed? They work with Roy and Jonny. Look, I know you've done your best while I was away. And it couldn't have been easy being on your own. Look at me. We are gonna turn that place around. Do you hear me? Yeah. Wait, wait. Slow down. Fucking shit! I love you, bruv. I'm proud of ya. I think we've done well. Turn the music up. Why's the music so low? We're trying to have a party. What's going on? Ed! Turn that fucking music up, Ed! Turn the music up! Turn the music up, son! - So what do ya think of the new place? - Yeah, it's nice. Right, let me treat ya. This is on the house! From me to you. Can you do me another one of those things? Yeah, same as before, yeah? Yeah, 100 percent. I told you, Saturday. Yeah, definitely. Cool. - You all right? - Who was that? Who? Jason? Oh, oh, that's just some kid I bought a laptop off a couple of weeks ago. Just had to give him the last of his readies. - Honestly! - I didn't say anything. No, I know. You don't have to. I know you. Anyway, I better get back to work, eh? It's heaving in there, innit? Hello, Chloe. I'm home now. For good. I just wanted to come and see you and talk to you, that's all. I'm not about, leave a message. Sean, you call me back as soon as you get this message. Eddie boy! We heard you was home. - Long time. - Roy, Jon. Oh, I hope you don't mind. The door was open. No, that's fine, mate. I like what you've done with the place, mate. Very modern looking, very hip. Bet this cost a bob or two, didn't it? No, not really, me and Sean done most of it. - You fucking... - Hold on a minute! Just slow down and let me explain. Hear me out, please. Look, Jon, Roy, have a drink with me, please. Come, what do you want? No, don't worry about a drink, Ed. It's all right. Just sit down, yeah? Look, I got a beautiful bottle of brandy behind here. Just get over here and sit down, you slippery little cunt! Now! - Where is he? - Who? You fucking know who! Your scumbag snake of a brother. - Now where the fuck is he? - Sean? He had nothing to do with this, I promise you. Oh, don't give it all that, Ed. He's got everything to do with it. Honestly, Roy, he had nothing to do with it, it was all me. I bashed the pair of 'em myself. I dunno what you've heard, but Sean didn't even want me to pull 'em. The fuck are you talking about? Bashed who? Well, Freddie Bagshott and the other geezer. Look, Roy, I know he's a friend of yours, but I'm telling you now, he was rude and he was disrespectful. But it got out of hand in the heat of the moment, you know what it's like. He pulled a blade on me and I... - I just lost it. - Freddie Bagshott? Fuck him, he probably deserved it. No, no, that's not why we're here. We're here about the other thing. What other thing? He don't know. He ain't fucking told him. - Told me what? - Ed... Your brother's in a serious bit of trouble, mate. - Why, what's he done? - He's fucked us over, that's what he's fucking done! Shh. You'll have to ask him that. But the big question is, no one's exactly sure what happened. But there are rumors, and they ain't good. Yeah, and what are these rumors? Well, that he's a fucking grass, among other things. My Sean, he'd never, ever in a million years... It's not just that. Let's just say he's upset some people. He took something from 'em that was theirs, and he ain't give it back. And, well, they ain't gonna wait much longer. How much? A lot. And all this doin' the pub up, splashin' out, don't look good. In fact, it's adding insult to injury, and these people, they can't let that happen. Doesn't matter who it is. Whether they say they was involved or not. Everyone around him's going. Fucking everyone. You understand that? - Yeah. - Yeah, so... you gotta have a word with him Ed, lively. 'Cause this can't be allowed to go on, it's gotta stop. And these people ain't stupid, you know that. - Don't ya? - Yeah. Good! Well, I look forward to hearing from you. Sean! Sean! Sean! - What's wrong? - Come here! - What the fuckin' hell have you been up to? - Why, what have I done? What have you done? I've just had a fucking visit from Roy and Jonny Garrett. Why didn't you tell me? I was gonna. I was just waiting for the right time. - I didn't want to get you involved in it. - Involved? They want to iron me out, Sean. Look, come on, I'm just gonna pop out, babe, for a minute, all right? Come on. I used to see Roy at the pub. He said if I ever needed anything he could hook me up. And what are we talking about, Charlie? 'Cause I found someone who wanted a bit. I saw an opportunity to make a few quid. So we started doing bits and pieces together and it was easy money. I would just pick the work up, sit on it for a couple of days, and then hand it over. It was a doddle, money for nothing. The next time we went it was a big 'un. The biggest one yet. - So I plotted the gear up. - And where'd you put it? In the garage under Mum and Dad's. Same place I always did. Next day, I come to pick it up, and it's fucking gone. Someone done me. They must have tailed me. Who else knew where it was? No one. Not a soul. Mate, you're out your fucking nut most of the time, you fucking can't remember. - You must have told someone. - I didn't! And the only reason I'm doing so much gear is - 'cause of the stress of all this shit. - Please. Honestly! I was doin' all right before that. This whole situation's completely fucking slaughtered me. I'm looking over my shoulder in constant fear. Any minute I'm gonna get one in the back of the head. How about the other geezer you was working with? The bloke you was giving the fucking gear to? Just some kid. What, the kid from the other night? Jason? Well, how'd you know it weren't him who had it? - Nah, it weren't him. - Sean, you don't know that. I do. I know who took the gear. Well, fucking tell me. I don't care who it is. We'll go to work, and we'll get it back. Think about it. Well, it's obvious, innit? Think about it. It's the same fucking ones who gave it to me. They set me up, Ed! I'm not the first one they done it to, am I? I mean that's their game, innit? Two days later, they come round to me, saying they heard I got spun, and they wanted to know what I told the police. Well, that's bollocks! No one even knew I had the fucking gear apart from them. - I hadn't told a soul. - How about Rikki? On Mummy's grave. On Mummy's grave. So how much do you owe 'em? I took two key off 'em. You're not answering my question, Sean, are ya? How much do you owe 'em, readies? Eighty. Eighty grand. Sorry, Ed. How ya doin'? I'm looking for Solly. - Who? - Solly, the owner. I've never heard of him. My boss might know him. Steve! - There's someone here to see you! - Oh, okay! He'll just be a second. Cheers. Hello! Can I help? Yeah, this used to be a mate of mine's shop, fella called Solly Beckman. Is he still about? Ah, no, no, sorry. Hell, we bought the shop off him about four years ago now. Retired. Moved abroad apparently. - So what can I do for you? - I wanted to know how much you'd give me for this? - For that. - Yeah, yeah, sure I'll take a look. It's a windup. Yeah... Yeah... Um... Needs a service, bit of a polish. It's a bit dry inside, hasn't been oiled in a while. It ain't been on my wrist for about ten years. Ah, okay. Uh... The best I could do is probably three and a half, and that's being generous. Three and a half? I gave eight grand for that. Yeah, they just don't hold their value anymore, sir. Everyone's got one now. - The exclusivity's gone. - Yeah, yeah, I know, I know. I was looking for more around the seven mark. There's no way you'll get seven for this. Tell you what, best I can do is four. And I probably won't make anything on top of that. Forty-two hundred, and that's only 'cause you're a friend of Solly's. Go on then. But it's gotta be cash, all right? Yeah, yeah, cash done. Great. I'll just go and sort the paperwork out. That's aging nicely. Trainee horologist, see? - It's a nice watch. - Yeah, it was a nice watch. - Hey! - Well, there he is! - Hello son, how are ya? - I'm good! - Ah! - Come in! That was lovely. Lovely dinner, that. You're welcome. It wasn't lovely. It was fucking unbelievable! Sorry! I shouldn't swear. I'm so sorry. - Ah, he's all right. He's heard it all before. - I won't do it again. You ain't got a clue what I've been hearing for the last ten years. All right, okay, fair enough! - Thank you very much. - Oh, you're very welcome. You're welcome, mate. Do you remember that flat you used to live in? That little pokey one bedroom... Whoa, whoa, slow down about pokey flats! - You telling me you've never lived in a pokey flat? - Of course I have, mate! Do you remember that geezer that lived underneath? What was his name, that nutty skinhead fella? Ah! You're going back to Eastern Road. Yeah! Yeah, big fella. - Hated everyone. - Yeah, he was. - Yeah, I remember that. - This isn't gonna be a good story, is it? No it ain't, no. No, no, no, no. What was his name? Yeah, what was his name? - J... Jack? - No, no, no, no. - Big Joe. - Big Joe! - Of course it was! - Big Joe, yeah. - Big Joe! - Do you remember, I said to ya... I was going out, I was going to the gym. I see this geezer, as I'm going out, pull up. Big lump, covered in tattoos, swastika, T-shirt, proper, proper, fuckin' white supremacist lunatic, - wasn't he? - Out of order. He was out of order. - Of course, you had that lovely girlfriend, didn't ya? - Dominique! - Dominique! - Oh, I fell in love with her. - Soon as I laid eyes on her. - Aw... - Look at his face. - I know! It's taken him back. - But you met her. She was a lovely girl. - She was! No, she was lovely. Gentle, soft, gentle. But he's in there, with his lovely girlfriend, in his flat. - All of a sudden, the windows go through. - No... 'Cause Big Joe's smashed all his windows. I just lost it. I wanted to fucking kill him. But she was like, "No, no, no, no, please, please, don't!" Anyway I got a little baseball bat over on the side of the armchair. - Baseball bat! - Oh, you! You keep out of it. It's bedtime, are you going to go and say good night to everyone? - Yeah, night-night. - Come here, say good night. - Good night. - Good night, fella. - Don't forget me, your old uncle who's been away! - Good night. Now remember something, you sleep tight... and don't let the bed bugs bite! He's a good kid. Look, all I'm saying is, between the two of us, since we was kids growing up, you've done fucking well. - Yeah, I've not done bad. - Yeah. You went that way, I went that way. - But look what you've got. - We're doing all right. - You should be proud, mate. - I am. This gaff, fuckin' unreal. - Pulled up, I couldn't believe it. - It's nice. I mean, I'm in that pub, I've got a fucking... I'm in one room. It's like, it's no different to the nick. You'll be all right, Ed. So, come on then. What you got? - You got anything? - Like what? Don't give me that, you've got something. I know it, I can tell. Look whatever it is, I'm involved. I am bored, mate. Mike, listen to me, those days are fucking gone. - Mate. - They're gone! Listen, it's doing my head in, man. This place is driving me crazy. - Anything. - Mike... - A blag or something. - Mike, listen to me. Me and you are like a couple of old dinosaurs. We don't exist, it's gone. The reason I'm here... The reason I'm here is because I need to lend some money off you. Okay. How much? I need you to lend me 20 large. You know me. I got readies coming to me. As soon as it comes into my hands, - it goes into your hands. - Ed, it's fine, mate. It's fine, you're all right. It's the least I can do, eh? - You're sure? - Yeah, it's fine, mate. What can I say? It's good to see you, mate. It's good to see you. it's been a long, long, long, long time. Have some more of that. Chloe! Are you stalking me or something? What is wrong with you? Please, just give me a chance to get to know ya? - I just want to get to know you and Francis. - Don't say his name! Don't say his name like you fucking know him. What are you talking about? You're my family. Family? You're not family! Eddie, family are there for each other, they support each other. You've never been there for anyone, Eddie. No one but yourself. And you won't give me one little opportunity to make up for lost time? - No! Fuck off, Eddie! - Why? I don't want you in my life! You're not my dad, you're just some bloke, so go away and leave me alone. - The fuck is goin' on here? - It's all right, it's all right. - Just calm down, calm down. - What are you waiting for? Go on. Do you wanna go any slower, bruv? Did you hear what she said? - I'm sorry, mate. - Are you sorry? Go the fuck on, bruv! Drive your fucking car. - Move the fuck on! - The whole fucking neighborhood... - Who the fuck was that? - I don't know, just some idiot. Get the fuck upstairs, bruv. You all right, fellas? - Just wanna say thanks for seeing me. - No problem. - Look, Roy, I wanted to just let you... - Shh. What are you doin'? - He's all right. - All right? Of course, I'm all right. What you got me down as, some sort of grass? - Bottle it. - Just sit the fuck down, will ya? Dunno, can't be too sure, can ya? Might run in the family. Please, leave off, mate. Where's Sean? Sean ain't here. Well, we can see that, you cunt. Why not? Because I'm here on his behalf. Well, he's a grown man. He should be able to face his own problems without his big brother wiping his arse for him. He's a fucking spineless, gutless, little cunt, your brother. A fucking waste of human life. Where's our money? There's 25 grand there. That's all we've got at the moment. But I'm telling you now, once the bar is up and running properly, I'll be able to give you a little bit more. In a month or so, I'll drop off another envelope. But for the time being, that's all we've got, and it's gonna have to do. Now let me get this straight. You bowl up here, bold as brass, your scumbag brother nowhere to be seen, with a poxy 25 bags, and fucking tell us that's how things are gonna run? Who the fuck do you think you are, some kind of heavy fucking villain or something? Look, Roy... Now you fucking look. I said I wanted our money, in full. And I meant it. I'm doing everything I can. Now gimme a fucking break here. You both know me, I'm a man of my word. I wouldn't even dream - of trying to fleece you. - I don't give a fuck who you are. Or how many times you've been nicked, or birded, you thick cunt. We want our money. And I can't give you what I ain't got. Please, mate, stop. Get your fucking hands off me. All right, Jon. That's enough. That's enough! Now, listen to me very carefully 'cause I'm not gonna say this again. I'm gonna take your 25 grand and call it interest. And I want another 100 in a week. Either that, or we take the pub. One or the other. If not... you and your rat-weasel brother are going into the ground together. Do you hear me? On my children's eyesight. Yeah. A week. Now get up. And wrap that around your fuckin' arm. You're bleedin' fuckin' everywhere. Toodle-oo. Ed. What the fuck's happened? Ed? Ed, you all right, mate? Where you going? I've gotta get outta here, Sean. I'm gonna go to the flat. - What? Now, this time of night? - I can't think straight here. I'm sorry, bruv, but it's her. She won't keep her fucking mouth shut! - Fuck off! - Fucking horrible bitch! Come on, let me... - Why didn't you tell me about Chloe's boyfriend, Jason? - Eh? "Eh, eh?" Why didn't you tell me about Chloe's boyfriend, Jason, your new best pal? Slip your mind? What else have you been fucking lying to me about? Nothing, Ed, I swear! Someone introduced us one night 'cause we're practically family, and we ended up doin' a bit of work together, that's it! Look, we was just keeping it low-key. Chloe didn't know nothin' about it either, so I thought it was best just to say nothin'. I didn't want to stir up any shit. I promise! Look what they've fuckin' done to me, Sean. Look what they've done to me because of you. - I'm sorry. - Sorry is no fucking good, mate. Don't you understand? We're fucked. They want the pub. Everything me and you have fucking worked for, all the graft we've put in, it's all fucking out the window, gone. - I'm sorry. - Don't fucking say sorry to me again! - I'm s... - Say fucking sorry! Go on, say it! I fucking dare you! See what happens. - Say it! - Stop! Now you need to leave me alone for a bit. 'Cause I can't have you wrapped around me at the moment. - You've caused all that. - No, I don't think so. - Yeah, I think so. - Well, I don't. What the fuck have you done? What is he on about? - Who the hell wants the pub? - Nothing, it's got nothing to do with you. Nothing to do... I think it does, I fucking work there. Listen, just stay out of it, all right? Go and sniff a bit more gear, - you fucking skinny junkie cunt! - Why didn't you tell me... Fuck yourself. I tell you what, you're lucky I'm such a fucking gentleman! Stupid... You're not right in the head, are you? Or was I not clear enough before? I don't need your charity. Please leave me alone! All right, all right, all right. - What happened to your lip? - It's got nothing to do with you. Who done it? Leave me alone. Fucking hell... Oh, no, it's a bad one. It's gone through the baby grow. Look at me. I've gotta say, he does look like ya. Yeah. Everyone says that. I think he looks more like Mum. Can you pass me the baby wipes? All right, come on then. Oh, you've done a real stinker, haven't you? Who's done a big poo poo? Who's done a big poo poo? Yes. Hold this. You know that's what got me through my sentence. What? This photograph. It's the only one of us all together. Oh. I know! I never even knew that photo existed. What? What? I know, I know. And that's why I wanted you to have it. Because it means the world to me. Why are you giving it to me then? If it means the world to you, you ain't dying? No, of course I'm not dying. It's just... I just thought it would be nice, you know, as a peace offering along with the money and that. - I told you, I don't want your money. - I know, I know you don't. Huh! You've gotta understand something. I loved your mum. And believe it or not, she was the love of my life. - It's just the pair of us... - Don't give me that. Don't give me that crap, Eddie, all right? I ain't stupid. You forget I'm not a little girl anymore. I know everything. I know everything, all right? You've never given a shit about anyone but yourself and you know it. You know it was your fault? Right? It was your fault Mum got cancer and died. No, no, I'm not having that. You can't put that on me. - It's the truth. It's the truth! - I'm sorry, I'm not having that! She was never the same after you left. Sorry, after you abandoned us. For what? For what, something half your age? It's disgusting. Out of interest, yeah, how long did your little girlfriend come and visit you for? After you went in. Six months? A year? Exactly. Two-minute wonder. Yeah, nice new baby. Come here. So tell me, what happened to your lip? I don't want to talk about it. - Was it Jason? - None of your business. All right, look, answer me this then honestly. - Has he ever done that before? - Stop! Stop, all right! I don't need your help, Eddie, you're not my dad. You're not my dad! I can look after myself. And he's not gonna do it anymore 'cause I'm getting out of this shithole. Aren't we, bubba? Aren't we, bubba? Chloe look, I know I've made mistakes. I know I have. And I know that I can never, ever, ever, - make up for lost time. - My baby... But I'm telling you now there's not a day that's passed where I haven't thought about you. Every single day since the day that you was born. Honestly. Can I hold him? Please? Okay. Okay, baby. Okay. - You've got to support his head. - I know, I know. I've got you, I've got you, I've got you... Aw, don't cry for Granddad. Don't cry for Granddad. Yes, it is. Yes. He's gorgeous, isn't he? You see that lady in the picture? That is your nanny. She would have loved to have met you, Francis. I can't believe it, he's actually gripping it. You know what that means, don't you? That means, that that little picture's yours. And that is a present, from your granddad... to you. Showering me with cold water, she went out to get me some Oreos. Man, we was just laying there in our naturals... Bruv, what the fuck is this guy's problem? What? My problem? Get up and hit me. Come on, get up and hit me. - Get up! - I'm sorry! I can't! Now, remember, you fucking hit her again and I'll kill you where you stand. Do you understand? - Do you understand me? - Yes, yes, please don't... What's the matter with you? Do you want some as well? Nothing to do with me, nothing to do with me, bruv. Then fuck off! - Cuz, cuz, you all right? - Fuck off, bruv! Excuse me, young man, I'm looking for the white plastic painter suits. Um, downstairs to your right. Thanks a lot. Go get that for me, Annie, would ya? - What, you're right there? - Oh, come on, princess. Just do your old dad a favor, yeah? For fuck's sake. Here, look, chuck your plate. That's better, that's it. Oh, Roy, not at the table. I can't help it, love. I'm sorry, it's important. Yeah. Eight o'clock. Yeah, I'll be there. Roy and Jonny are gonna be here any minute. - What for? - Why not have a wild guess, Sean? They either want the money or the pub, don't they? - You're gonna give them the pub. - Well, have you got their money? - 'Course not. - Well, then we've got no choice then, have we? - Look, Ed, I never meant... - Whoa! Don't even go there, Sean. No, stop. Stop, Sean. Because I don't believe a fucking word that comes out of your mouth anymore. In fact... In fact, after tonight, I think it's best if we don't see each other for a while. And do me a favor, yeah? When they get here, you let me do all the talking, right? You don't open your mouth. You keep it fucking shut, I mean it. Not one single fucking word, do you understand? Yeah. Come in, chaps. Fuck me, Jon, look who it is. The man himself, he's finally decided - to make an appearance. - Can I get yous a drink? Not for me, no. Jon, for you? No, we're fine, thanks. Let's just get down to it, shall we? So go on then. We're intrigued. Well, obviously you know we ain't got the readies. Otherwise, we would've paid ya. So we've decided to give you the pub. There's the keys, the license, and the deeds. But there's one thing I need to know. I mean, once this is all done, me and my brother need to be able to move around freely as before. I'm just asking for no more ag between us. Yeah, hundred percent. And personally, I was upset about what happened the last time we met. Got out of hand. Yeah, literally. Sorry, yeah, no pun intended. But look, seriously, it's put to bed now and no hard feelings and all that stuff. And I apologize about what happened, you didn't deserve that. It was half a liberty. Yeah, it should've been him. You had a right touch your brother was here to save you, Sean. You got off lightly. But you know that, don't you? You jammy little cunt. But if it turns out you are a grasser, you know the consequences, don't you? Eh? If he was a grass, I would've done him myself. Come on, Roy, you know he ain't a grass. Let's stop playing games, eh? - Sorry? - Well, we all know what you've done to him, don't we? What you talkin' about? Don't give me all that old bollocks. You really think we're that stupid? It's the oldest one in the book. Really? What's that then? Put a bug in the gear, clamp it back, put the heavy on. It's the old bully boy turnout. Do what? Look, Roy, you got what you wanted. Now please do me a favor, do not insult my intelligence. I've been at it since I was a little boy, I've pulled every stroke there is to pull. So I am far too shrewd to let a couple of thick bully boys like you two have me over. 'Cause let's have it straight, shall we? That's exactly what you are, ain't ya? A couple of bully boys. I mean, you ain't real men. All you've ever done is suck and feed off of proper money-getters. People are only nice to you because they're scared of ya. And when you two walk into a room, people can't wait for you to leave. You know why? I'll tell you why. Because you're hated. You're fucking hated by everyone. Cheeky fuckin' cunt! Who the fuck are you? Fuck me! No! Cut you up! I'll cut you up! Shit, they're fucking dead. Fuck me, they're dead! What are we gonna do? Ed, what are we gonna do? Go to the back room, get a tool bag and bring it to the toilet. Sean! The tool bag, to the toilet. This can't be happening. Sean, I need you to come here and open one of those bags for me. Are you gonna help me or what? You need to grab that hacksaw, and you need to start on his legs. It's getting stuck. Fuck. Sean. You done well. Stop thinking about it, 'cause it had to be done. Now let's go home. Sean! You all right? What's wrong, babe? Sean, Sean, babe, tell me what... Sean, talk to me, it's okay. You all right? Police! - Room clear! - Clear! Fuck. Cheers, mate, you got a pen I could lend? It's an emergency. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you very much. Hello? - It's me. - Oh shit, bruv, thank God. Where are ya? Don't worry, I'm safe. I've had the old bill 'round here. What'd you tell them, Sean? Nothing. So why are they looking for me? Didn't say. So where are ya, I'll come meet you, eh? What for? It ain't safe talking down the phone. Got to sort this out, haven't we? Sort out what? You know, about last night. Ed? I'm still here. You of all people, Seany. We have got nothing to sort out. You have a nice life, bruv. He's gone. What just happened? - What did you say to him? - Nothing, you heard me. No, I did hear you, but you said something. - No I didn't... - Yeah, you gave him the heads up. I didn't give him the fucking heads up. You heard me! That wasn't our agreement. If I find out you marked his card, that's it, Sean. Play that back, I want to hear it again. He's a grass, Mike. Can't believe it, they were right all along. My own brother's a fucking wrong 'un. So sorry to hear that, mate. I should've known, you can't trust a fucking junkie. Can't trust a sniffhead. You know what it's like when drugs are involved, people change. Is there anything I need to know? You're sweet, don't worry, the only thing he knows is I picked up a white van from you and that's it, I swear to ya. It's all right, it's a hard one to prove that. It'll be all right. - Got you burger and chips, is that good? - Yeah, lovely. Just spoke to Jimmy. He can get you out tomorrow night. - He ain't gonna do it for nothing. - How much? Five, six grand at least. Five, six, grand. I can give you a bit towards it. No, no, Mike, you've done enough as it is already. It's not just about me anymore. There's a little job that I've left behind. You'd love it, it's a doddle. To be honest with you, I was gonna do it on my own. But it's all prepped and it's ready to go. Sweet, I'm in. What is it? Right, in and out. - Who's the boy? - I dunno. It's a lot of bodies, Ed. I'll come in there with ya. No, no, no, just stick with the plan. Right, one of you put the kettle on. Tom, I thought you said you hoovered this floor? - I did! - Oh yeah, what did you do it with, a brush? Anyone goes near the fucking alarm and they're dead. - You, take that fucking bag and fill it up now. - Okay. - Move, move! - Okay, okay, yeah. You stay back, turn away. Turn away! Yeah, I'm filling it, I'm filling it. Yeah, I'm doing it. That'll do. Now I'm warning ya, anyone follows me out, they're fucking dead. Tommy, what are you doing? - You shot me in my leg! - I told you to stay back! Laura, call the police, don't just stand there. Just call the police! It's okay, it's okay... Sorry mate, I had to keep moving. Okay, so what time we got to be there? Yeah, that shouldn't be a problem. He's here with me now. Well, let me go, and I'll have a word with him. All right. Bye, mate. What'd he say? We gotta get you to Folkestone. The boat leaves at 2:00. He ain't gonna wait for ya, we have to leave now. I need to make one stop first. It's too hot, mate! We can't keep buzzing around the manor like this! - It's untidy! - I know. - We're asking for it! - Yeah, I know. But there's something I need to do. I need to make one stop first. And that's it, I promise ya. Please, Mike. Where? I'll be as quick as I can. I'll wait around the corner. - Thanks. - You're welcome. You all right? What's happened? Are you in trouble? - With the police? - Yeah. God, I'm so stupid. I should have known. I should have known you'd never change. Chloe... Chloe, I swear to you. I had no choice, it had to be done. What had to be done? You're going to find out sooner or later. So you've brought trouble to my life? Again. You are a walking disaster, Eddie. Everything you touch turns to shit. Don't you think I know that? Do you actually think that I don't know that? But I've tried, Chloe. I've tried, but life won't let me. So what now? I've gotta go. - All right, well, off you go then! - I just wanted to say... What are you waiting for? Off you go. I just wanted to say goodbye, that's all. I just wanted to tell you face to face that I love ya, more than anything. And that I'm sorry. - I'm sorry. - Bullshit. I wanted to give you this. What the fuck is that? - It's a gift. - I don't want it. - Please take it. Please take it. - I don't want it. I don't want your charity. I don't want it. Take it, sell it, do what you want with it. Use the money to get out of that flat. Please. Try and rent somewhere nicer for you and Francis. Take it. Can I hold him for a second? I need to hold him for a second. Just for one second. You gotta support his... Your granddad loves you, you know that? Your granddad will always love you. And we are gonna meet again. I swear. I'm gonna keep in contact with you, I promise. I won't hold my breath, Eddie. I love you, Chloe. Of course you do. Fucking hell, about time. I'm sorry, mate. Go, go, go! - Mary, what's happening? - I think there's been a shooting down there. Can you watch Francis?
