Yeah, hello? We're on our way. We're getting to the party. What do you mean you guys are gone? I thought we said we'd join you. Ah... no more alcohol? Okay, yeah. Ben! Let me have a chat with Marion and Fleur and I'll call you back. Actually more with Marion, because Fleur is in the middle of a lips workout. Hey bruv! So, Girls? What do we do? Marion? Fleur? - Ben! - What? What?! Have you changed your wifi pass again? - Have you changed your wifi pass? - Are you still connected to my routeur? - Hiya Ben! - Hiya. Go ahead.

Or a psycho. Either a sales rep or a psycho. Fuck, mom! That can't be true. Use the doorbell! It's an emergency. You're not answering. Your nephew used my Ipad. Now it's unusable. Mom, I don't have time for that I swear. - I'm doing this for you. - Okay, give me that.. I want to book a restaurant for when we arrive in Biarritz. Don't you find your virtual encounter a wee bit pathetic? Don't you wanna leave some room for the beautyf of randomness? Do you prefer Caves Saint Jean or Chez Bibi? I don't know Mom. Honestly it's in 3 days, I don't give a shit. - I'm gonna ask your brother - Right, ask him Arthur! - Hiya Nicole! - Hiya! Where do you want to eat on Tuesday night? We're going to the Courtepaille before the motorway exit. What? Is this a joke? No, mom, it's more handy. They have a ball pit. No, no, it's either the Caves Saint Jean or Chez Bibi. Choose.

I have exactly what you ask me for. You really got meds? I got you an antiacid. You needed it. That's very very nice. I wanted to make things right for my date. My very first Tinder date. - So it's really your first Tinder date? - Well, yes. Cause usually people say that, but... - And it's not true? - N?o. Ok I see. And you? Is this your first? - No, it's not your first? - No, I didn't lie to you. How many? I don't know, I didn't count. Thirty, fourty?... Thirty, fourty?! Yes but don't worry, I usually get bored after 1 minute. Alright. I'm not sure it makes me feel better... - Well, cheers. - cheers! To antiacids! You're luck. This one is lemon flavoured. They're the best. Compared to what? Compared to mint flavour, they're disgusting. Horrible. Have you ever tried? Dreadful. They almost lost me with the mint flavour. - Wait, are you pharmacist? - No, I'm a sales rep. But I hate feeling sick. That's why I always carry meds with me. I you want I have some paracetamol, If you sprain your ankle, I have arnica. Always one step ahead. - So what do you do for a living? - I draw. - You draw - I draw graphic novels. That's great.. And do you make a living of it? - No. - No? I'm living on government money waiting for a suggar daddy. Hence the dates. I see. Shit. - I'm kidding Benjamin. - That's what I thought. Sorry, I take everything at face value. I'm going step by step... - I think it's time... time to go. - Time to go. We're going! Although, I'm very sorry, but I think you'll have to say good bye to your best friend. Fuck, I forgot she was here. I feel like she's a part of me now. Yes, now you're great. I feel she's a shoulder pad. You... you... You'd like to go for a walk? I'd love to, but the problem is I have another Tinder date in 30mn. Oh yeah? - Woaw - Ben! We're past that now! You should have understood my humour by now. Fuck! I didn't get it at all. Are you ok? Are you crying? You really cum like a deaf and mute person. I don't want to disturb your neighbour. Holy cow! Holy cow! Fuck! Holy cow! Are all you Tinder dates like that? Nah, stairs sex is just with you. That's good to know. Can I use your bathroom... To clean my hands> - You want to take a pee? - Yes.

No no, wait, actually I could use your help. You must know your way around taxes. Do you what 'unrated taxable income for PEA-PME'? That's my tax return. Ok, do you have any shares in a business? A PME or a PMI? Non? Nha, he's an experimental musician. Ha ok, well in that case, no need to fill that document. - I'll leave you to it. - Do you have a fag? - No, I don't smoke. Ciao. - Bye. - Ben? - Yeah, I'm here. Come with me. - Where are you? - Come in the kitchen. Where are you going? Come! I didn't know they were together. They're having a bath. Nah, sometimes we have bath as friends, that's all. Alright. Ok. Come on. One step each. - It's very high. - One step each. Careful! It's nothing. It happened to me a thousand times. Look at me in the eyes. - Honestly I hate you. - You adore me. - Holy cow. Give me your hand. - Do you adore me? - Yes, for real, I... Come on, we're almost there. That's exactly what I needed to end the night. Dying falling from a roof. - So, your holidays will be in Biarritz? - Yeah. Yeah, it's Biarritz. Three weeks. Like the past 37 years. Oh yeah? Eh. You, where are you going? I'm going to Beirut, with my crazy friends. - Beirut? - Yes. That's lovely. But isn't Syria better that time of the year? Very good time. I think you'll a better blast over there You know Syria is great. But I've already been, Ok I see. Didn't know I was dealing with a peacekeeper. We're good here. I could sleep. - Fancy a wee nap? - Yes. No way Ben. Do you actually have mouthwash with you? Wait. You were never supposed to see this. You were sleeping. - I thought it was the good time to do it. - Ben, you can't plan everything ahead. I'm not planning anything.. Look, I never planned to meet you tonight. Or that we have sex on your doorstep. Or that I'll end on a roof like an Aristocat. No, I didn't plan any of that. But I can plan to have a fresh breath in the morning. There. Will you come on holiday with me? - Come again? - What? - Perdon? What? Did I just say that? - I heard your voice. - Yes, I think that was me. - You told me something. - I said that, did I? Do you want to? - So, two times? - Yeah, sorry, it's getting confirmed. I know you'll go on your way, and I'll go on my way You're gonna meet people and live your own thing. But I just want this to go on. Just a wee bit. Forget about it. What's between Beirut and Biarritz? Halfway. - Bulg?ria? - Yep. Why Bulg?ria? She was supposed to go to Beirut with her friends And me to Biarritz Who said 'what's halfway?'. We opened a map and boom. Bulgaria's there. So you're gonna miss our Beirut trip to go on holidays with ESIC? Yeah, so what? I think you forgot what holidays are when you're in a relationship. - I'm not in a relationship. - Let me stop you here. You're two human beings. Who have sex. You're traveling together. Couple holiday. So you ditch us for holidays with a girl you don't know, in Bulgaria? My brother is insane. 'Oh I'm hungry'. 'Look at this cute Inn'. 'Amazing, sweetheart. Let me check their ratings on Tripadvisor.' - Only steamcooked food. - Or yogurt. Yogurt is safe. 'You're so cute in front of that church' 'Wait, lemme add a filter' 'I love it. What caption should I write?' 'Holidays of Looove?' If i were you guys, I'd eat at the hotel restaurant. We've decided not to stay in a hotel. We'd rather stay at locals'. - Please don't say that. - Perdon? Which local? At any local. A nice one. In an AirBnB What's his name? Beebee? That's not his name mom. I'll show you. That means I'll go on holiday by myself with... - When did you guys meet? - Last week-end. I knew it. Laugh as much as you want. Holidays are the hardest test for a couple. Funny to start with it. That's just crazy. N?o faz sentido. Let's go. I need to syncronize both devices. I've got videos on this one that I don't have on that one. I think that's us. - Ben? - What? I think that's us. It's a shame you slept. The scenery was lovely on the way I went far far away, wooo. It's here. I recognize from the picture. See, that's a typical bulgarian house. I see. It's great. - Shouldn't be on the sea front? - Yes, I think it's on the other side. Ok. Wait, no. Actually the sea is on the other side of the road - Over there. At the very end. - Yes, correct! - Marion! - Yes! Yes, yes. I didn't understand a damn thing. What? Come over! - Do you need help? - Nah, I'm good. Oh, we're dancing now? - Nice, isn't she? - Very nice indeed. Muito bonito. But... Fuuuck. Isn't it so cute? Yeah, good old kind of cute. So so. Not really an answer. Holy shit. I knew it. What is this place? It's genius! Yeah, superb... Superb. I'll take a pee and we go for a visit. Sorry! Marion, wait for me please. We have a to be super reactive. Do you know that one person out of two in the world dies on this road? - Quick! - Wait! Marion, for real. I'm not jot jocking. Prepare to have your mind blown. It's wonderful. - It's dreadful. - What? The tide is quite low, isn't it? Don't you think? Oh cool. a jetty! - Let's have a dip! - Go ahead, I'll catch up with you. - Wait for me! - Here we go! Please be careful, there's a lot of rusty shit. That's Tetanus beach for you. Marion, water is shallow! Careful! You ok? Did you hurt yourself? Not at all! Water is great! Are you coming? Nah, water is a bit too brown for my taste. Come on. The sand it covered in mud. It's super soft. That just grosses me out. No no no, What the fuck are they doing? Raios partam! Qual ? o teu problema?! Welcome to Bulgaria! They're in water now! Go get it! That can't be true! - Are you afraid of dogs? - No, I'm not afraid of dogs! - They're attack dogs! - Nah, they're very sweet dogs.. So? Happy? - What are you doing here? - Adventure eh? At least you were right. It looks wonderful here. Tht colour of the sea. What is it exactly? Brown? Dirt? You were right, Biarritz is overrated. You made the right choice. Enjoy your holidays. Should we go? Ben? Should we go? - What a shame, I was in such a deep sleep. - Let's go visit the town? Fuck. So fucking annoying. Ben, what are you doing? Taking a shit? No, no no no! I'm having a shower. Est? bem. Have you found a power plug that actually works? Try the one downstairs next to the kitchen. Alright, but make it fast. I've found an amazing restaurant. Cucu has recommended it, but they only serve til 9pm. Sure, Let me just finish. - Ben? - Yes, I'm coming down. I've found my phone. Dobar vecher. We're almost there - Are you coming? What are you doing? - Just having a look at the menu. Looks really good. - Here? - Yes. Salads, tuna tartare, tataki. It all looks good. Stop it. We're not dining here. It's awful' - No, it looks good. - No, it's a big tourist trap. But we are tourists. - Lemme just check on TripAdvisor. - I beg you. Let's not go there A local gave us the adress of an amazing typical local restaurant - Sure. - See? it's crowded. Maybe it's crowded because it's actually good. Dobar vecher. - See, they're fishing for tourists. Dobar den. Certo. Dobar... Well. The chef is so sweet. He let me charge my phone in his truck. Great. There's only locals. That's a very good sign. I saw that... - Hmm! Delicious! - Seriously? Looks like an oil bath to me. With potatoes. It's delicious. I swear. Taste it. I can't. - You loss, it's really good. - Honestly I don't feel like it. You less. What is it? My mom. Sending pictures of her and my cousins. - You text your mom a lot, don't you? - Yes. You and your mom are strongly connected. We keep in touch. We chat. We communicate. Yes, you're the family kind. We take care of each other. I don't know. Seems pretty normal to me. Oh, no, I'm not... Isn't it the same with your family? My family is quite small. Just me and my mom. And I can't stay we're very close. My mom is not really trustworthy. But it's alright don't worry. My family is the people I've chosen. Time for rakia. I love that woman. I'm so happy we're spending five days at her place, she's so sweet. We're spending five days at... - Yes. - Ok. In Bulgaria we say nazdrave. I'm not having any.

Turn on the light. Wait. - Fuck, that stuff was strong. - Very strong. Are you taking your shoes off? I'm keeping mine. Marion, Marion, Marion stop pressing against my belly I don't feel good. - I'm sure you're alright. - No I don't think I can... - What's wrong? - My tummy hurts. - Seriously? - Yes, for real. Nothing will happen down there anyway. I don't feel good. - You men are such a pain. - How come? We don't need a 90 degrees 60 ou 65 is way enough for us Okay but we're talking 15 here. Or 2. I swear. - Please don't be mad at me? I'm sorry. - Fico. Please, I'm begging you. Oh great, now you've turned the lights off. Ouch, Holy cow. Oh fuck. Shit. Fuck. What the fuck is he doing here? He's breathing. - Ben? - Yeah? What happened to you? - WHat is it? - Ah fuck. I hit my head on a tree branch. - A branch? Did you go out? - Yes I went out, for... Yes. - During the night? - Yes, I was out like... At 2 in the morning. - There was a, like... - A horn? No. There was a wee kitten. Meowing. - A kitten? - I took it in my hands. I pet it, told it to relax... And then there was the other guy. What's his name? Todor. - Yes, Todor. - He showed up, screaming. "Cat! Cat! Cat! Cat!" - In English? - No, in Hungarian. - In Bulgarian.. - Yes, in Bulgarian. From there, I got scared... I turned ahead and I didn't see the branch I took it right in the kisser Poor you, that's awful. What was he doing there? I don't know. - Why was he screaming? - I don't know. He was pished. - He was pished. - He was totally pished. Plus he was holding a whip. - A whip? - Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah. - Do you think he hits the cats? - Look, I don't know if he hits them but what's sure is that they eat them. - Bullshit. - I am not kidding. I'm telling you, they eat them. I used the little path down to the barbecue Yeah? Listen to me. I saw huge balls of cat fluff. Burnt cat fluff. - Perdon? - Right on the grill. - You're saying they have cat barbecue? - Yes. - They're sick! - Listen, I don't know. What can I tell you? - What should we do? - We get the fuck out! I'm leaving. I can't tell you better. I'm not ok with this. Of course not. You're right. Problem is I paid for 5 days. - That's not a problem. - I'm gonna try to negotiate. No no, you're not going to negotiate. I'm going to negotiate. It's my job after all. I do that every day. Plus she didn't respect the rules. - That's true. - There's no privacy in the room. That other guys plays rock music at 7AM. To me, it's a faulty contract. So you get our stuff ready And I'm gonna go tell her. But first, I need to brush my teeth and freshen up quickly Enough with this comedy. Hmm... oh well I don't give a shit. Adeus. It's all good. I took care of it. Let's roll. - For real? - Yes, give me the suitcase. - Did she give the money back? - Of course she did. - How? Wire transfer? - In cash. Look. Ben that's a piece of paper. Listen, we don't give a shit. Four nights for 20 euros. What do you mean? Are you crazy I'm not leaving one single euro to cat killers. - We'll the authorities in Paris. - No. Let me handle this. - Cucu. - Hi Marion. Todor. He's admiting. - You shat in her garden? - What? I never shat in her garden. - What happened? Who cares what happened. You think that's the right time? - Water? - No, thanks. What is that? Fuck, there's a rat! I stepped on a dead rat. For fucks sakes. Make it stop. What's wrong with you? - I've just stepped on a dead rat! - So what? It's your fault if we left Cucu's. This place was great! - No, wait, this place was not great. - Yes it was. Marion it's time to loving everything in life. This place was manky. The room was dreadful and I'm sure she burried half her family in the garden. Stop laughing. I'm telling the truth. Excuse me but that beach? A jetty below a motorway? That's not my definition of holidays. Holidays are, at least, some clean sand and water that doesn't look like Coke. Shit, let's just find a hotel with power sockets that work. I know you hated that too. At least I don't shit in people's gardens. I can't take a dump behing a curtain. Can you understand? I'm sorry, I was close to a mean bowel obstruction. Even as a kid I couldn't poo at my friends'. - I just couldn't. - But, Ben, poo is life! Marion, please, we don't know each other. It's our first holiday. I don't want to talk about poo. - I don't want to. - Ok. - Keep your poo and I'll keep mine. - I know what you need: Sunny Beach. - WHat? - Sunny Beach. It's a big resort city, cocktails, parasols, stupid beaches everywhere. - You'll love it. - That's not what I'm asking you. I also love adventure, but if we could go to Sunny beach now, it would be awesome. Let's go. Shit. Ben? Ben. I have 2 piece of news. A bad one, and a slightly worse one. Marion, you need to stop waking me up like this all the time. - It's brutal. - This bus doesn't go to sunny beach. We said hotels. We said hot tubs. - Ben, Ben. - What? I need to tell you. I've got two new best friends. Almog and Yuval. Just here. They're gonna take us to the best spots in R?dope Park. Isn't it great? No Marion, we're not following some strangers we don't know. Ben look at me. I have a very good feeling about them, Trust me, I have an instinct for that. You have an instinct for lying. Look at them. Don't they look nice? No, they look like circus jugglers. All good. I don't care if I sound posh and if you feel ashamed of me, but I feel we'll end up sleeping in trailers. I can feel we're gonna have to shit in the woods again. I can feel it. Paradise for goats. I'm not fit for this. At all. Ben, heads up. - I know, it looks amazing. - Is it beautiful or not? It's beautiful, but I'm not adapted for this. You all have moutain boots. I've got beach shoes. Ok, I love this place. No way. French people in Perelik? Yes indeed. - Hello, I'm Marion. - Hi, I'm Philippe. From Bruxelles. - Benjamin. - First time in Perelik? Congrats guys. What I love about french people is that you're always ready for adventure. - You think so? - I had no idea, but alright. - Should I show you around? - Yes, with great pleasure. This is the bathroom area. I mut warn you, showers are a bit dodgy. Sometimes hot, sometimes cold, but you'll get used to it. Can you visit the toilets though? No you can't. Can you see the scarf? It means it's occupied. - Bye Marion, enjoy your holidays. - Stop. Come back here. - You don't like the scarf system? - Let's continue. This is the kithchen corner. It's amazing. This is a Bulgarian family. There's a turnover, but today is their turn again. I must warn you, it's not really good, but they're extremely nice. Portanto, todos cozinham alternadamente? So does it mean we take turns for cooking? - Exactly. We switch regurlarly. Can you cook? - No. Excellent! You'll learn! That's what's great about Perelik We're all open to help those who don't know - Exactly! - It's great. That's exactly what we came for. Thanks a lot for the tour. - He's nice, isn't he? - A bit annoying if you ask me. - Really good. - No, it's not 'really good'. - We're 25 per room. - We're gonna be just fine. Have you ever had such a king size bed? I'm not in Erasmus Exchange program. I'm too old for that. Where will I put my stuff? I'll have to hide my money, my laptop... Well, after all, we can be flexible. Let's not act like buzz killers here. - Promiscuity can be fun eh? - Yes. - Look at you, you sound relaxed now. - Sure, we don't care. Holidays are holidays. So where were you before coming here? We spent a month Tirana, in Alb?nia. Then we'll stay here two more weeks, then we'll head up to Belgrad And finally Sarajevo, since it's Jeanne's dream. Why? What do you mean Ben? Sarajevo is gorgeous! It's my dream! And actually, it's not much - Something like... two years ao? - Yes, two years. - We spent 16 months in Asia. - 16 mois? But don't you have a job? Do you ever work? Of course we do. You know, traveling the world is a full time activity. That's not something you improvise. I find that lifestyle fascinating. Totally amazing. - It's a choice. - Exactly. - The world is such a big place. - True, true. It makes me want to cheer to our world's beauty - Yes, to our world's beauty! - to our world's beauty! to our world's beauty! Mother's Earth Energy... You give, you receive, You give, you receive... Hey, don't we look like we're in the musical 'Hair'? It feels so good to be here. Eh? We're good eh? I think I'm switching. For real. - What are you smoking? A blunt? - Yeah. - It's soft. It's natural. - In that case... Philippe grows it on its deck. - The belgian guy. - Belgian guy gave you this? Oh, it's coarsed. Oh, it's strong. That's one hell of a deck he's got. Those two are amazing, aren't they? So much freedom in their lives. Freedom, please... - A very capitalistic freedom. - What are you saying? Did you hear what they say? They rent their flat in one of the biggest european capital to people who are quite rich, meaning they promote real estate speculation And from there, they travel the world in the cheapest places. And finally they give us humanistic lessons, wearing ponchos. That's very well played, but I'd never call that freedom. You're proud of your theory, eh? It's not bad. Not bad. On the other hand, I've got much respect for, hum For Tania. Of course. She travels the world. She's so brave. I'm really proud of her. - And more importantly, she's very, very fit - So fit - What? I mean she's fit, but... - You're smoking truth potion! I'm not even looking at her. My wee frenchies! Canyoning! Stop it. It's embarassing. They're unbelievable. All they need is to blow their nose to stop sounding so nasal. I know a great ENT specialist who can help them. And apart from that, you're really into canyoning? What's canyoning? - Come on, Ben. - Why in hell am I doing here?! Fuck! - Come on. - Why did I say Yes? - Just lean backwards. - I can't! I'm going to die! - Just put your feet againt the rock. - Go on Ben! - I thought we'd be doing canoeing "C?nioningue!" I can't stand those two anymore. For real, I can't. I'm on the wrong slope. I'm going to slip. Three, four... YOU'RE BUSTING MY BALLS!! That's the first thing you learn when... - Fuck. Give him your hand. Trust him. He used to be in the army. - All good? - What? - Why not take your pants off? Flash them your arse? - Ben, it's alright. - No, it's not alright. - There's no worry with them. What do you mean? - Ben. - What? They're together. They're gay. How do you? Nothing about them says they're gay. Ok, fine, obviously they're gay. It's not a reason though. As soon as they're a gay guy around, you girls always flip a switch and start flashing your boobs and talk sex with them like they're your best friends. - They're still guys. - Falafel! In Paris we have a restaurant called 'Ace of Falafel' It's in 'Le Marais' quarter (gay district) Don't make me carry you upstairs. Come on. - I'm thirsty for water. - Shhh - Everybody is sleeping - I don't give a shit Israel is not sleeping. They always sleep with one eye open. They're gonna get up at 6am. Then build a tree house. - Porra. - O que foi? - Oh fuck. - What's happening. - What's happening. - Have a look. Fuck, they're shagging! She's a brave one, that Tania. They lied to me. They're not gay at all. Of course they're not. You made it up in your imagination. - I can't believe it. - What should we do? What do you mean 'what sould we do'? - Do you wanna go in? - Are you crazy? What got into you? I'm just saying. Just because they told me 'join us' Ok, let's go in if you want to. - You really want to go in? - Yes. - Ok let's go then. - One, two, three... I knew it you didn't want to sleep with them! You're driving me mad! Do you really think I want to see you like a meatball in this falafel? There are limits to my intimacy, period. - Come on now. - Yeah, yeah. Canyoning! Don't tell you're eating? Yes, you are. I'm starving. - Is it good? - It's amazing. - Give me some. - You want to try? - There - Try that - It's good. - So good. - There's chorizo if you want - Not a bad idea - It's good - I love chorizo A bit too salty though. - Just a bit. - Just a bit too salty. That's my first aperitive-sex ever. Ah, that's better. What a good meal. When will it stop? What? In the last 72 hours, We got kicked out from an AirBnb I almost died doing canyoning, And now we're sleeping in some staples because two israelian shaggers have claimed the dorm. - That's dense - So dense That reminds me of that movie with Grassman and Trintignant, "Le Fanfaron". Jean-Louis Trintignant is a quiet young man, who meets Vittorio Grassman and decides to follow him. And crazy things happen to him. I know. I've seen that film. It was my dad's favourite film. I love it. But you forgot to mention that Trintignant's character dies at the end. - No way? - Indeed. - Shit, I'm sorry. I totally forgot. - That's funny you forgot that detail. I'm happy. I'm happy too. - He's doing something really weird to me. - Close your eyes. Sinto a tua energia. They're not even looking at us. They ditched quite fast, didn't they? They live the moment, not like us. They touched. Deeply. - Let's go? - Let's go. - You alright Ben? - I'm good. It's just the sweat in my eyes. Weather's so humid around here. I feel like we'll never see them again. That's what pisses me off. - Don't worry, they'll come to Paris - No they won't Next time, I'm having group sex with them. I don't care. Sharing is important. Time to take our walets out to pay for the tickets. - I don't have my wallet. Did I give it to you? - No. I don't have mine either. - Are you kidding? - No, but it's all good. No stress. - Did you check your bag? - Yes, don't worry, we'll find them. - I always put it in the front pocket. - I'm gonna check. I remember taking it out. I put it here. I didn't put it back here? Then we walked up the hill. And then we... Oh fuck. What? - Fuck! Fuck! - What's happening Ben?! - The israelians robbed us. - Bullshit. - Of course they did. - You really think they cleaned us? Obviously, when they hugged us like a couple of cunts. - Fuck, those two fags! - Yes, they are fags. - But I aslo really love them. It's bugging me. - The ticket inspector is approaching. We have no money, no ID. Looks like we're good for 24h in jail. So annoying. - Get up. - What? Get up. Let's hide. Are you crazy? We're going to have a chat with this lovely moustache man and everything will be alright. I don't think so. I'm not spending 15 years in a turkish jail getting buttfucked by turkish prisoners. I don't think that can happen by getting arrested in Bulgaria. Trust me please. Just get up and put a smile on your face. Alright. you've snapped. You've obvisously snapped. - What are you doing? - I'm creating a decoy. You're just drawing all the attention on us. Look back to check if he's after us. - What are you doing now? - Setting up some traps. He's following us. Come on. What the fuck are you doing? Ben?! - We're surrounded. There's another one here. - Relax Ben, I'm gonna talk to them. I'm gonna explain it all. Everything will go smoothly. Let's jump. LET'S JUMP! Are you crazy? What are you doing with that door? - LET'S JUMP! - re you out of your mind? Don't toss my bag! Are you crazy? - Come! -What the hell are you doing? COME ON! - Did you see how I jumped?! - Like a mad man! - I jumped! - Like Jason Bourne! - Fuck the police! - Yeah! - We're outlaws! - We're thugs! We'll never py again! Could you talk to them a little bit? I'm afraid we're being quite rude. Do you speak english? I think they're having a good laugh at you. Looks a lot like piss to me. What are they doing now? - It was a joke? - Of course it was. Obrigado, pessoal. - Oh, nice jump. - Wonderful. - One, two... - You're good Ben? Absolutely not. One, two... Who exactly did he call sexy? Thank you, life! - Are you happy now? - Thank you, life! - Finally a clean place. - You have it. You stay here, I'll check in at the desk. I'll ask if my brother wired me some money. Marion! We're officially in heaven! Marble everywhere! Sejam muito bem-vindos. It's gorgeous. So gorgeous. Is he actually explaining everything? Please do something. I'm begging you. - That man is crazy. - You gave him 20 leva? - yes - That's a lot of money, isn't it? - Who cares, we're on holidays! I'm hungry. Are you not hungry? Let's get a room service. We're gonna be just fine. - Oh... The bed got me. - Are not up for something else? - It's so comfy. - You know that thing you wanted to when we got here. The water park? No no no. Let me have a wee nap Give me an hour, and I'll be all up for the water park. But first I'm gonna sleep reading a good old book. What a plan. They discovered a 4.5 billion years old meteor in Australia. Can you believe it? Crazy, eh? No? Wifi works like a charm here. I'm shattered. Should we go to sleep darling? I mean Darling... Are you ready for sleepy time? No, I'm gonna draw a little bit, I'll join you later. Alright. Have a good time, with music. I'm gonna get a water bottle for the bedroom. Aqui tens. It's... amazing.

How long have you been here? - In this hotel? Three days. - Alright. - First time in Bulgaria? - Yes indeed. Amazing. That's the second time for us. - Yeah? - Yeah. Because you really like the country? Nah, it's not really interesting around here. It's difficult to find nice holidays destinations these days. - You bet. - Spain is crowded with german people. Greece is broke since the economic crisis. - True that. - Morroco, Tun?sia... I don't want to get shot when I'm taking a nap on the beach. It's no simple, I tell you. Especially for 800 euros all inclusive. It's ridiculous. I call this 'The Happiness Bracelet' Everything is so cheap here. ESIC! We wanted to visit Nessebar this afternoon. Do you want to tag along? - Nessebar? Is that the old town? - Yes absolutely. You've been talking about it for day. Would you like to go? Oh, come on. - Let's do it together. - We don't want to force you. Let's do this. Excellent. "Tra... ces... go... from... the..." City... of... Me... sem... bria..." - She's made so much progress. - "O... X... I... I..." "Be... fore... G... C..." - J.C. It means Jesus Christ. - She hasn't learned it yet. That's why. - Very good, Naomie. - Congratulation sweetheart. I'm not finished! Don't worry, you'll read it later. Give Marion her book back please. No I don't want to! - Give me the book back, Naomi. - No! - Come on darling - No I don't want to Give me that book Naomi. What are you doing? Give me that book Naomi. Naomi, give me that book. Oh look, an ice-cream shop! Got ya! - She got me too. - Me too, there's nothing there. You shirt is ugly. - Perdon? - So is your bag. You're ugly, like everything you're wearing right now. Oh oh, well said! Listen, Naomi, That is called an opinion For example, your wee pink bracelet, I find it absolutely disgusting, But I'm sure you find it cute, right? Yes, Mommy bought it for me. Oh yeah? See, I hate pink, but you seem to love it You wear pink head to toe. 'Na na na, pink is for girls' I hate that - Ok that's enough. - Let's resume the visit? - See, we both are right. - You are so mean! - What? - Don't answer. No, it's really importante. There's something you didn't get I'm not mean, Naomi. You've been mean to me. - Very mean by the way. - That's emough. - Alright, alright. - I think she can understand. So should we meet again tonight? - At the hotel. - Yes, the hotel. - ESIC! Later. - Later. - I want an ice cream! - We'll get you an ice cream sweetheart. I think you had enough ice crem for the rest of your life Hey, that's enough now. - What a nightmare! - No, you can't have an argument with a 6 years old girl. That was insane, what you just did. Being six doesn't giver her the right to be so obnoxious. Don't get to her level. That doesn't make any sense. First of all, why do we have to put up with these boring people and their rude kid? What's with this stupid social obligations between french people? I don't know. Maybe I just enjoyed their company. I find them nice. That's all it is. - You found them nice. - really nice. You are bright red, you know?. - Am I? - You are. I didn't realise. I just loved it. He's really getting on my nerves with his sexy. Since when do you call me your wife? What? You're mmy wife in some way, no? The place I'm taking you tonigh is totally crazy. It's a japanese restaurant. The chef is Mamachiko, I can't remember Mamofokou, or something like that. Five stars on TripAdvisor. - Fleur! Hey. How are things in Yogurtland? - Things are really good! I've been trying to phone you for two days - Where are you? - Well look, I'm here. What's up in the Balkans? Are you having fun? You're so funny. I miss you guys so much. -Hiya! We have to go. - I'll ctach up with you guys.

You know I don't necessarly want to have sex after you had a really good poo when your brain is really ta peace, and your skin is really well oiled. - A bit rough... - This really pissed me off These are my friend. I'm happy to have them on the phone. Why do you have to fucking interrupt me? Well, ok. Should we dress up and go to the restaurant? I don't feel like it. Why? I don't want to eat sushis in Bulgaria. Can you understand? It's funny, how obsessed you can get. Por isso, toca a andar daqui para fora. - What's with her and her 'hop hop hop'? - Hop Hop Hop she booked the chairs. - What is that way of talking to people? - Sorry, we really didn't know that. . Calma, calma! - Marion, they're insane, let's just go. - No. it's importante. - You have to stop now. You're insane. - Did you hear how he's been talking to me? Cunt! - Marion, come back, I'm sorry. - Fuck off! Marion, please, come back. Marion! Oh shut your mouth, you. I'M WORRIED MARION PLEASE ANSWER MY MESSAGES h? You want to try some real bulgarian tradition, eh? Nazdrave. Boa noite. Sabe onde fica o festival Exit? N?o sabe? Obrigado. On the beach? Thank you! N?o estou a perceber. Ben. Marion... What's wrong? How could you do this to me? - What's the problem? - The problem? I've been looking for you for two hours now! I've been looking everywhere, for fuck's sakes. I've been calling you fifteen times. You never answered. And you're here with that guy who wants to fuck you since day one? Nothing happened, what are you talking about? And I don't need to justify myself. - You don't need to justify yourself? - No I don't! It's not about justifying, it's about respecting me. Do you realise what you're telling me? You want to put a lead on me. I was the one on a lead the whole holidays! - Let's do this, let's do that - Didn't you have the best holidays of your life? I loved it. But I brought you here for three days because I really like this place. No, you did it to be comfy in a hotel full of old cunts. In fact, we just don't have the same expectations. Why did you come get me tonight? I came to get an apology. You'll never get any. See, that's crazy... what could I actually expect? Going on holiday with someone I barely knew? Enjoy your holidays.

You sleep together? - Are you crazy? - I think you overused drugs. Since when have you been sleeping together? - two weeks - two months Two months? Why didn't tell me? We didn't hide it from you. You were on holidays. - I got back two month ago. - And it's not been easy talking to you since then. Yup. You're on the edge. You're quite closed to us. A wee bit passive-aggressive. We were a bit scared to be honest. To tell you. That's true. Tell me what? That we are together. When you say it like that, for sure... Ok, alright. I'm going. I need to process this. Too much information right now. - Wait Marion, let's talk about it. - No, I'm going to bed. - We can get to bed with you if you want? - No, that's creepy though. - It's just to comfort her. - There are limits. It's a present. It vibrates. - You know, because you're single. - You're a cunt. Is it good> Is that really the image I give? A self-centered person? Who can't stand others being happy? - It's dreadful. - No, it's nothing like that. It's just not very clear for us too. Should I remind you we're talking about Rom? I know. How are you going to put up with him? I don't know. No idea, at all. I know he's never gonna change. He'll never know how to fill up his tax return form. He'll always make brocoli dance and say that's how he makes a living. But... I think he's a freaking genius. And I'm found of him. Odd, isn't it? I find it beautiful knowing that you are together. And to be honest, I always knew it would happen. Oh yeah, of course you knew! You shut your mouth. Careful, That's a music instrument! So. Come with us. Enough with your garbage. Come get some air, you're so pale you look like Mylene Farmer (french singer) 'Libertine' (song name) Wait. - Wait, excuse me. - What is it? I don't know, it's just... - Am I chocking you? - Yes. I can't breath. I'm sorry. Do you want to get on top of me? - Okay - This way you'l be getting some fresh air Hurry up. Hurry up. Ouch, you broke it in half. - Yes, but you're a bit... - Alright, here we are. It's good like that. It's good. Wait, what are you doing? Stop. If you do that, my breats will get saggy and I hate it. Okay, I'm sorry. Now that I've told you that, I can see the image and it makes me uncomfortable. Okay, so what would you like to do? - Should I take you from behind? - In the butt? - What? - No? - Is that what you want? - No. Okay, but we need a solution, quick. Cause things are getting lower. - Do you like spooning. - I love it. It's itchy. Wait, my butcheek is stuck. It's not bad like that. I can feel your bellybutton. It's funny.
