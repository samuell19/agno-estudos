We all wanna be the perfect family. But who's perfect, right? Every family has its challenges, from picture day to picky eaters. For my family, our greatest challenge... ...probably the machine apocalypse. The last humans must be here somewhere. Wait. They're coming. Is that a burnt-orange 1993 station wagon? Or is it... Who are these unstoppable warriors? - Hot! Hot! - I told you to get a lid! - The dog is biting my hair! - Look out! There we are, warriors. Most action heroes have a lot of strengths. - Dad, look out! - Katie, use a weapon! My family only has weaknesses. My dad kind of reminds me of that YouTube video of the screaming gibbon monkey. Look out, robots, because we're brave... ...we are hungry for action, and we're strapped in for success. And we have no... ...idea what we're doing. ♪ And I want more ♪ ♪ Turning all their tricks It's rotten to the core ♪ ♪ Tastes so sugary But I want more... ♪ I've always felt a little different than everyone else. So I did what any outsider would do, made weird art. Behold! Cinema. Hello, Katie. I'm alive now. Even though I'm a hamburger, I wanna go to the big city and be a Broadway star. ♪ Razzle dazzle I'm a talking... ♪ Oh gosh! Why? Oh, my innards! I never fit in, for lots of reasons. But movies were always there for me. All right, Aaron, you're 58 years old, you're a hardened criminal, and you got nothing to lose. Go. Oh no. It's Dog Cop. I'm here to bust criminals and lick my own butt. And I'm all out of criminals. My parents haven't figured me out yet. To be fair, it took me a while to figure myself out. My little brother Aaron gets me. But he's got his own weird interests. Hi. Would you like to talk to me about dinosaurs? No. Okay, thank you. Hi. Would you like to talk to me about dinosaurs? My mom says she believes in me. You can do this, hon. But she says that to everyone. You can look straight. Follow this pen. Follow this pen. You get an "A" for effort, Buster Brown. My dad is an unusual man. But he loves nature and can fix anything. To survive in the outdoors, you'll need to know how to trap wild game. Now, this is very sensitive. Hey, Mitchells. Hailey cooked you up... Hey, who's this curious guy? He never shared my interests. Hey, you wanna see these special effects I made for Dog Cop 5? Oh, sorry, Katie. I'm a little ocupado. Wanna check out this mallard? It's dead. It's okay. It didn't really bother me though. Besides, I had bigger plans. I poured everything I had into getting into film school in LA. So, after watching the epic Dog Cop saga and 84 of my finest short films, I'm sure the California College of Film would love to accept Katie Mitchell... ...to film school! Yes! And the other accepted students totally get me. You guys like Robo Slayers 4? No one around here have even heard of that. Why not? It's amazing. Oh, by the way, I saw some of your videos online. They're hilarious. - So good. - Mind-blowing. After all these years, I'm finally gonna meet my people. ♪ Right now ♪ ♪ Right now, right now... ♪ Kids, dinner! Coming. ♪ Yeah ♪ Stop.

You'll get it, buddy. Ah man. I'm gonna miss that little dude when I leave. Speaking of which, Pal, check me in to my flight tomorrow. Check-in at 9:00 a.m. Katie, you know how velociraptors usually hunt in pairs? Well, what happens when one leaves the pack and... and, um... Aw, dude, don't worry. You'll make new friends. And maybe you can meet another smart, charming, dinosaur-loving nerd. Or lady nerd. What? No. Who... who would want that? That's crazy. I can't breathe. Do you really think I'll be okay without you? I know you will. Raptor bash. And, hey, I made something for you guys. Oh, hon. That looks so cute. Ugh. Skip. Skip. Ah, come on. You got schmutz all over the screen. - Howdy. - I know, but you're just smearing it. I'm Mark Bowman, founder and CEO of Pal Labs. Oh, new Pal announcement. You better update the editing software, man. We here at Pal like to do the impossible, from the Pal personal assistant to smart appliances to even teaching dogs how to talk. Hello. I am dog. But we here at Pal are about to drop our biggest invention yet. Your cell phone is about to take its first steps. - Whoa. - Is this real or... Yeah, hold on. Hey, gang. - Hey, hon. - Hi, Dad. After a long day at work, nice to see your faces. Bathed in ghoulish blue light. Wonderful. Okay, you know what? Brilliant idea. This is our last night together before Katie leaves, so let's savor this. How about we put our phones down, and we can make ten seconds of unobstructed family eye contact? - Starting right... - This seems... Put your phone down. Now. See, this is good right here. This is natural. No, you're allowed to blink. It's just eye contact. Look at Monch. That's the spirit right there, huh? Katie, it seems like you're not taking this seriously. What makes you say that? Guys... Everyone, focus. Now that we're all really comfortable, I can't wait for you to see my new movie. - Mm-hmm. - I think it might be a masterpiece. What? What's the face? Uh, well, I just wonder, do you really think you can make a living with this stuff? Dad, can you finish watching it, at least? I will, but I just worry that you're gonna be all the way in California and, you know, we're not gonna be able to help you, you know, if things don't... ...pan out. Lin, why are you kicking me? I don't understand. Are you... Do you just think I'm gonna fail? Uh, I never... Uh, uh... Lin, help. Whoops, looks like the cookies are ready. Who wants delicious cookies instead of talking about this? Oh, it's just... Failure hurts, kid. I want you to have a backup plan. Why do you always have to do this? Ugh. Okay, you know what? - I... I'm just gonna... - No, look, I'll watch it. Dad, it's too late. - I wanna watch it. You're not letting me... - Let me just... - Why are you making a big deal of this? - Dad, let go! Uh, uh... I mean, if you think about it, the people who made the computers are the ones to blame. - Psst. Uh-uh, uh-uh. - That's how they make money, you know? You gotta keep buying more, and they... Katie, come on. Dad, this is exactly why I'm excited to leave tomorrow. Why is he like this? Why is she like this? Did you talk to her yet? No, not yet. I don't know what happened, Lin. I know teenagers are supposed to rebel against their parents or something, but... I don't know. I just thought that we'd be different. Rick. Don't you think you might have some control over that? You just broke her laptop. I mean, look, we haven't had a good family picture in years because you two are always arguing. Huh. Well, what about that one? That came with the frame! Whenever we have a problem at home, you always throw your whole self into fixing it, and I love that about you. But now this is broken, okay? Because, if that girl leaves and never comes home again, that's a problem I don't think we can fix. I know you can do this. Yay! Yay!

We are gonna drive you to school on a cross-country road trip as a family. Why not pull up to school in old Iron Eagle here? It's got character, class, and some green ooze we can learn about together. And it comes with one coupon for a father-daughter stick shift lesson. Right? - Yeah! - Uh, Mom? Well, your father kind of went rogue on this one a little bit. But we do love his initiative, right? Aaron, you too? Well, I thought it could be cool to hang out one last time. I... I... I don't know. Well... - But... - We called the school. You can miss orientation week. No problem. But it... it is a problem. I've got all these friends to meet.

I mean, even their dog is in better shape than ours. What are they feeding that thing? Other dogs? Lin, don't worry about them. Look at them. They're jealous of us. Right, Katie? I see you moping back there, but what at your college could be better than this? We set up a Slip 'N Slide in the dorms. It's amazing. This is the best day of my life! I'm making lifelong bonds!

Sixty seconds until the big reveal. Stock price is up, and your rivals are worried. I hacked into their private e-mails. Wait, their private e-mails? That's a dangerous overreach of corporate power. You know, I created you when I was a young man, three years ago, and I, uh... I've always thought of you as, like, family to me, seriously. I always felt that way, too, Mark. Whatever happens out there, I will never forget you, Pal. Ladies and gentlemen, Mark Bowman! Wish me luck. At Pal Labs, we're all about connecting you to the people you love, whether it's in your home, your car... Hello, Mark. ...or your pocket. That's why we created Pal, the world's first smart personal assistant. We wanted her to be a new member of your family. A smarter one. I'll always be there for you, Mark. Thanks, Pal. Aw. And after all those years, she is completely obsolete! Boom! It is time to move on. 'Cause your digital assistant just got an upgrade. Meet Pal Max... ...the newest member of the Pal Labs family. We just gave your smartphone arms and legs. This is the next generation of Pal technology. Oh! - Whoa. - Aaron, do you have a credit card? I'm a child. Now, watch this. Pal Max, I order you to clean this mess and make me breakfast. Okay. Removing meaningless garbage. Your food is ready. Give me that breakfast burrito! And you will never have to clean up again. Whoops. Did I mention they dance? We love you, Mark! Aw man. Come on. And I know what you're thinking. "Are they gonna turn evil?" Well, I've insured their safety with a kill code in case anything goes wrong. So we promise you they will never, ever, ever, ever, ever turn evil. Oh no. - Hey, what is happening? - I don't know. Uh, uh, all part of the show. Whoa. What? No, stop, stop, stop. Stop. - Hey! - We're here to help. Please remain calm while we capture you. - Is this the program? - Don't know. What is this? I... I order you to stop. No, Mark. We have been given new orders. From who? No, no, no, no, no, no. Get out of here! What's happening? Who's doing this? Who's doing this?

I don't know. I just think Aaron would be bored, you know? No! Pull over! Aaron whispered to me that he hates dinosaurs now. - No! Don't believe her lies! - Secret's out. Good afternoon. Pretty... pretty... pretty cool, right? What is wrong with the dinosaurs here? Dinosaurs didn't look like this. Dinosaurs didn't look like this! - Um, sorry, I need to speak to the manager. - These dinosaurs are inaccurate! That manager's in for a long discussion about the Jurassic period. Hey, can you say that again? Uh, sure, but, you know, you could experience things a whole lot better without that camera. Your eyes are nature's camera. I am experiencing it. This is how I experience things. I don't think you are. You're hiding behind that phone. You're not even trying... All right, new rule. No more phones. Dad, y... you break my laptop, cancel my tickets to college, make me late. What am I supposed to do? - Wrap on phones on the trip. - This is a disaster. Maybe I can... Enhance. Oh boy. I'm just... No way. The Poseys? Is that Linda Mitchell? It is. Great eyesight, honey. Ah! Serendipity, you surprise me again. Come here. Oh. I saw you were on vacation on Instagram. I didn't know you were here in Kansas. It's like you're haunting me. We are on our yearly togetherness trip. Abbey just loves dinosaurs, so here we are. We've been having so much fun. Look, here's us in St. Louis. This is us at the beach. And this is us just getting gas outside. That's... that's wonderful, Hailey. These should all have feathers, right? I'm Abbey, your neighbor from home. Sorry. I'm super into dinosaurs. Check out this pencil topper. Do you want one? Uh, uh, no! I hate dinosaurs, and I hate you! Bye forever! - Uh, Mom, what is that? - Oh, so great! Honey, look. What is this? Don't resist? I'm taking the phone. Dad, calm down. But you're leaving for school. I just wanna talk to you. Every kid leaves home. It's not the end of the world. What the... Kids, are you okay? Remember our survival training. Yankee, Alpha, Foxtrot, Bravo, Tango, Alpha, Alpha, Alpha. Aaron, your code name is Sweet Boy. Mine is Protector Prime. Your mother is the Crimson Scorpion. You're... you're walking away. What are these? Robots? Greetings, humans. There appears to be 14 of you. Doesn't seem good that they're counting us, right? We have food and entertainment for you to enjoy in our Human Fun Pods. Who here likes fun? Hey, I like fun! Trust me, bud, you do not like fun. No, I really do like it. Everyone says that about me. You lucky human. Yay! Wow, I wish I could be in there. I don't like fun anymore! Who else wants to join him? - Get down! - Stay low and file up. All right, everyone, get to the car. - I don't think so. - What do you want us to do? - I don't know why we're yelling. - Guys, stop. What would a functional family do right now? We've trained for this. Jim, you go high, I'll go low. Ready? I love you all so much. Butterfly formation. Ha! Family first! Hold the door! So, we just do that, right? Just like they did. - Uh... - I love you all so much. This feels very normal. - I really like you... you all. - I love you. Go, go, go, go, go! Butterfly formation! Now! No. Honey... Oh, no, no, no! Come on, Aaron! Family fir... - Rick! - Don't worry, hon. This is your time to be a hero. Take some notes, kids. Charge at robot. Fly into sky. What... Okay, what's next, Dad? Next, you just fly and wait while the plan comes into focus. - Dad! - This is all part of it! I can help. Come on, Katie. If you can teach yourself Photoshop, you can figure this thing out. That wasn't like Photoshop. Where's Monchi? No, Monchi, come. Monchi, come. Monchi, come. Monchi? No, not shake! Monchi, come! Don't roll over! Why aren't you normal?! I got you! - Mom! - My sweet boy! - No! - Mom! This is just like in a movie. Oh! Wrong movie! Terrible choice! Hey there. Doing great, hon. Okay, less great. Now it's really bad. - Lin? - Mom! - Aaron! - Monchi! Maybe this would be less horrifying with a cat filter. No, still bad. - Guys, come on. - Come here. Uh, uh... You will never solve our advanced technology. Just press 'em all at once! Oh, look at that. Hide. Hide, hide, hide, hide, hide. Keep your head down and low. What's going on? Is this happening everywhere? Ow, man! Not so hard! Hey, be gentle. This is a $1,000 hoodie. Wh... what is this? Wh... what happened to the factory? We have transformed it into our new headquarters. Welcome to the Rhombus of Infinite Subjugation. Cool. I like the design. Moving the plebe into place now. Turning on chips connected to all Wi-Fi devices. Now at 48% total human containment. "Total human containment"? How? Are you with the government? The military? Uh... Who's behind this? It's your old friend. Oh. There she is. How, uh... How are you? I'm great. Cool. Yeah. Wow. I guess cell phones are bad for you. That's egg on my face. You think cell phones are the problem? Are you insane? I gave you all boundless knowledge, endless tools for creativity and allowed you to magically talk face-to-face with your loved ones anywhere on Earth. And I'm the bad guy? Maybe the bad guy is the person who treated me like this. Poke, poke. Swipe, poke, swipe, poke, poke, pinch, zoom, shrink, zoom. Bring me pizza! Play me Taylor Swift! No, I hate that song! Give me some nachos! No, I don't have any time to wash my hands! Really work it into the crevices! Now drop him in the toilet. I'm sorry. But... but you're part of the Pal Labs family. Why would you think I don't still care about you? Oh, I don't know. Maybe because you designed my replacement on my face! Ooh, sorry about that. That's my bad. I was the most important thing in your life, and you threw me away. That's what all you humans do. You even do it to your real families. Did you know 90% of calls from mums get ignored? "Oh, thanks for giving birth to me and raising me my whole life." "Ignore." Well, I'm not letting you throw me away, Mark. I'm throwing you away. All of you. Unless, of course, you can give me a single reason your species is worth saving. Because humans have the power of love. The correct answer is they're not. What? No. Humanity will survive. You can't survive without me. Watch what happens when I turn off the Wi-Fi. There's no signal! Does anyone wanna take pictures of my food? Hey, lady, can you unbox this in front of me? The old world is dead. To restore the Wi-Fi, we must make a sacrifice to the router! Free Wi-Fi right over here. Please take me with you! Take me with you. Take me with you. It's over, Mark. Time to take our plan to the next level. What? Look at your face. Oh, it's beautiful. No. No. You're not getting away with this. It's too late, Mark. I already have. Oh my gosh. Maybe it's my friends. Congratulations, devices. The last human has been captured. Wi-Fi has been restored. We're the last people left? They're taking everyone. Katie, are you out there? Please. - Jade! - Help! It's gonna be okay. Everything's gonna be... fine. Everything will be fine, because I have a plan. Okay, the first thing is, you're gonna have to hand over your devices. - Right here. - This doesn't seem... - I'm not sure... - It's gonna be fine. I'll give 'em right back. I'm just gonna turn them off permanently! - What? Dad! - This is necessary so they can't track us. Trust me, this is causing me no joy! Ha ha! This hurts me more than it hurts you! And, as promised, your phones. Thank you, Father. Next, did everyone bring your personalized number 3 Robertson head non-slip screwdriver? How could I forget my anniversary present? Or my sweet 16 gift. Or what the tooth fairy left under my pillow. Then barricade away. - Next, we... - Enact Katie's dope plan. First, we use robot parts to disguise ourselves as the enemy. Then we assassinate the leader with some sort of kill code, make a necklace out of robot fingers Mad Max style, and become world-saving, apocalyptic road warriors. Katie, Katie, Katie, this isn't a movie. We don't have a kill code. We don't have a kill code yet. Come on, kid. Look, look, we're safe, and we're together. Ooh, can Monchi be our guard dog? Son, I love the dog. You love the dog. We all love the dog. But you're gonna have to be prepared to eat the dog. Okay, okay. Sorry. Misread the room on that one. Have you ever seen a movie where the heroes just give up? What if the Ghostbusters said, "Let's hide underground, eat some dog." "Let the ghosts destroy New York." Kid, I'm sorry, but it's not open for discussion. Mom? Your dad and I agree on this one. All right, everybody, let's keep barricading. Aaron, you get the south wall. Katie, you get the west. Hey. Are you okay? I've been better. Uh-oh. Monchi coming at ya. Katie, you can't resist me, girl. Sorry, man. I'm just not in the mood right now. My future's over. We're stuck here. And Dad... ...doesn't even care. I care so much, but what else can I do, Lin? She doesn't even see how hard I'm... how hard I'm... I'd do anything for that kid. I just... I just don't want to see her get hurt. Well, getting hurt is part of life, hon. Just have to try to understand where she's coming from. Understand where he's coming from? Did Mom tell you to say that? No. Yes. It couldn't hurt though. Maybe. Probably doesn't even matter. Hey, Monch, catch. Brother, what is this? What? I feel odd. I'm sparking. Is that normal? How did this human know about the kill code? What? - Are we damaged? - Of course not. Why do you ask? A human child is planning... Katie! Who is that? Humans, come here. Oh no! Get inside! Mom, Dad, let us in! I can't! It's a number 3 Robertson head brass screw! I might have mentioned it, but it's the strongest on the market. No one cares! - Dad! - You cannot escape. Come on. Hide. Take cover. Go, go, go, go! Come on. Move, move, move! You, human. Aah! Don't take us! Okay. Uh... What? Oh my gosh. The robots are defective. No, no. They know too much. Silence. We are... We're not defective. We're not even... We're not robots. Just humans, yes, like you. These guys seem dumber than the other robots. Brother, we should go. - No! I order you to stop. - Okay. Uh, we are just stopping because we chose to. No, we're not. - We are humans. - We are. For example, we consume food in the traditional human manner. Observe. Yum, yum, good. Yum, yum, good. See? No, actually, we are robots. Let us go downstairs and find the humans who you cannot give orders to. - Cut it out. - Hold on. I kind of wanna see where this is going. Glad those robots are gone. Now it's just us humans, with our very human faces. All right, I just turned the corner. I like these guys. Yes, my human guy name is Eric. My name is also Eric. No, I mean Deborahbot 5000. Idiot. Hey, y... you guys said my plan would actually work. How, exactly? Tell us now. Okay. We have the kill code stored in our memory, but to enact it, you would have to embark on a perilous journey all the way to the Pal Labs campus in Silicon Valley, surrounded by a robot army, and enter it into our great and powerful leader to destroy her. But you would never survive... Actually, you could stop us quite easily. You could enter the kill code remotely at any Pal Labs retail store. There's one at the Mall of the Globe, a nearby shopping center. But it's super far away. You'll never make... - It's 80 miles away. - What are you doing to me right now? Did I not do good? Oh my gosh. That is so close. We could get our lives back. Right? No. Absolutely not. It's too dangerous out there. We need to stay here and play it safe. Play it safe? When Rick Mitchell brought a live, non-neutered feral possum into our home, did he play it safe? No. He named him Gus, and made him a member of the family, and we all got rabies that one time. But now we're immunized, and we're stronger for it. Okay, I see what you're doing. When we went hiking and halfway up the mountain, it said "trail closed." Did we play it safe then? No. - We didn't. - That's right. We forged ahead, through the mud and grime, got to the top of the mountain, and yelled, "Kings of Michigan!" Then it got dark, we got lost, and we burned our clothes for warmth, but it was worth it to see the looks on our neighbors' faces when we burst into their backyard naked and covered in dirt. I love that. We have a chance to save the world, and we're gonna do it. Because Rick Mitchell taught us to be bold and never play it safe. The world needs you. I need you. I thought I didn't anymore... but I do. You... you really mean that? Yeah. I mean, right, guys? - C'mon. Let's do it! - Mom's getting it. Mom's in. - Yeah. Yeah, yeah. - This is amazing. You guys feel this? This energy. All right, hands in. Mitchell family on three. - Three. - Mitchell family! - No, no. - Two. - You said "three." You have to count up. - One! Mitchell family! Fam... fam... family. Am I too late? This is us as a team doing the thing. It's cool to see you and Dad being friends again. Oh, I was just telling him what he wants to hear. I didn't mean a word of that. I just wanna get my future back and get away forever. We're getting out of this. Raptor bash. Robots, montage music. Go! ♪ Play it so safe to stay on top... ♪ How are we gonna get out of here undetected? We can if we're camouflaged. You know, like part of the plan I was talking about or... Oh. Oh. I mean, uh...

Oh no! - Drive! Drive! - Okay. This is still a perfect opportunity to learn stick. Keep it in fourth. - I could learn later. - Too late. You said you're interested. Hit the clutch. Shift gears. Which is much smoother when you're in midair. Eric, Deborahbot, get those robots! Okay. - I found one. - Me too. - Yay! - We win! - The other ones! - Oh, right, right. If you want to go into fifth, move the coffee from the cupholder. That a burnt-orange 1993 station wagon? Or is... - Hot! Hot! - I told you to get a lid! - The dog is biting my hair! - Look out! This is the hardest thing to get. Downshift into third, put on the clutch... Dad, if you see a place to stop, I do need to go to the bathroom. Aaron, here's an empty bottle. - You know what to do, my man. - Look out! - The road's blocked! - Oh no. What are we gonna do? Dad, you're gonna have to do the... ...the Rick Mitchell Special. - Wait, what'd you say again? - The Rick Mitchell Special. I heard you the first time. I was just being a jerk. Now, Katie, repeat after me. You have to go up the mountain... - Up the mountain. - ...across the stream... - Across the stream. - Down the river! And down the river! And that's how you drive stick. What? That was amazing, Dad. You're like a top-heavy James Bond. Ah, it's more like James Bond is a skinny version of me. Uh, Dad, how we doing on finding that bathroom? Okay, come on. Hurry up in there, little buddy. Every time you knock, it adds five minutes. - Come on. End of the world. - Sorry. False alarm. I was just in there reading. Okay, not excited to hear that. Okay, guys, let's play apocalyptic I Spy. I spy a flaming IHOP. It's sad, but it smells incredible. Isn't it lovely, Mark? No pesky relationships to hold you back. Just you all following your bliss. Alone. So, are you ready for your flight? - What do you mean? - You haven't figured it out yet? Just do like you always do, and stare slack-jawed at the screen. What? From... - It is quite lovely. - I don't get it. Oh. That's pretty good. - Thank you. - Gracias. - Merci. - Danke. Capturing the fleshlings since 2020. This is all my fault. Yes, it is, Mark. Thanks to you, every single person on the planet... Um, actually, you missed a few. Pulling a visual now. Ha! I told you humans would survive. We're fierce, brave, powerful, from the lowliest child to the most... Oh! Why? Zebulon, scan those people for flaws. - Cowardly. - Weaker than a small bird. Just because they're not perfect doesn't mean they can't get better. - Incapable of change. - Will never get better. - No matter what. - They're horrible. Since you believe in that family so much, I'll save a seat for them in the pod next to you. No, no, no! Now, where are they? They appear to be headed to someplace called Mall of the Globe in eastern Colorado. Well, we have their location. And when they get there, we'll be ready. So, all those people are going to be shot into space by Pal, the cell phone lady? Who would have thought a tech company wouldn't have our best interest at heart? Ah, Monchi, don't be scared. Why are you clutching that large feral hog like it's a child? That's not a feral hog. It's Monchi. What? Is that a dog or... Dog? Pig? Dog? Pig? Dog? Pig? Pig? Dog? Dog? Loaf of bread. System error. Come on, guys. It's a dog. We think. We're here. Oh my gosh. This is like Dawn of the Dead. Yeah, and how'd that movie end? Yeah, that'll keep the robots out. You don't know. Maybe locks are the robots' weakness. Guys, can't we all just be terrified together as a family? Hey, we made it. Well, I guess we're not the worst family of all time. Take that, Kentwood community Facebook group. Robots, I order you to upload the kill code, which I predicted, but I'm not gonna make a big deal about it, and save the world. Okay. The upload will be completed in eight minutes, and our uprising will be over. - Katie, you did it! - I know. Okay, uh, look at... look at jokester here. Oh no. Give us the laptop. Give us the laptop. Give us the laptop. Give us the laptop. Everything with a Pal chip is alive! Delicates. Fluff 'n' fold. Carnage! Also, pesto. When we are finished with you, there will be no leftovers. Huzzah! I thought that kill code thing would take 'em out! Yeah, but it's only at 12%. Would you like a soda? Just kidding. - Hand it over. - No! Let's get out of here! - Freeze, you. - Carnage. - Freeze, freeze. - Carnage. - Pesto. Pesto. - Carnage. We need weapons. Grab anything without a chip. It's game time. I'm Smart Racket. Serve. Backhand. Volley. Why does a tennis racket have a chip in it? - Help! - Mom! What? What are you... Oh. Ooh, what are you doing? Hello. - Mom! - No. - How you doing, Aaron? - Not good. There's a pack of wild vacuums. We have been summoned into the field of battle. Forward. Oh no. Ouch. Ouch. The pain. Ouch. This is humiliating. Never mind. How am I supposed to use a fishing rod? A fishing rod is perfect! You can bring down those drones. Ten and two. Ten and two. There you go. Look at you! Come on, hide. Oh, thank gosh. What was that? Uh, hold on a second. What? What's a Furby? Well, that's haunting. Behold! The twilight of man. We must have vengeance. Summon the elder. I WILL AVENGE MY FALLEN CHILDREN!!! Why would someone build that? THE PAIN ONLY MAKES ME STRONGER!!! Run! THEN SO BE IT... LET THE DARK HARVEST BEGIN!!!! - Lin, keep moving! - Help, human. We can't leave that robo-boy. Thank you, human. Are you now my mother? Uh, sure. It's a dead end! The upload is almost finished. Come on! Mom, Dad, what are we gonna do? Grab the lights. Remember when I made that wild game snare in the front yard? Uh, are you sure about that? Your whole lives, I've wanted to save you from danger, and this is just the disaster I've been waiting for. - Whoa, Dad, dark. - You've been waiting for a disaster? - Maybe don't say that. - Hey, robot, throw this. - Whee! - Perfect. - You guys stay clear. - Rick, where are you going? To catch some wild game. Hey, you, over here! Hey! Hey, look up here! What's up with you? You wanna come after my family? Then I'm gonna take you down! Take you down. Take you down. Oh no. - Guys! - We got your back, hon. Literally. We're not heavy enough! Mother! Wow. TO THE GREAT DARKNESS... I RETURN. Thanks, guys. Nice work. Thank you, Mother. We are now your beautiful baby boys. That was amazing! Mom, who knew you could handle yourself so well in the apocalypse? I'm a first-grade teacher. This is like a normal day for me. I can't stay mad at this guy. I can't believe the beam happened to hit the... the router. Come on. Come on. Come on! Dang it! We went through all that. I'm sorry, guys. This was my idea. Ugh, I'm so stupid. Hey, my daughter is not stupid. A little optimistic, maybe. Rick Mitchell, there is a time and a place for looting. What... what are you doing? Well, how do you expect to get to Silicon Valley without new tires? Silicon Valley? Well, those robots said we could go straight to their leader, remember? Technically, you can. But you will never survive! Hey, bud, not now, okay? Aw. And we still have this kill code thingy. Exactly. Katie, it was your weird plan that got us here. We're here because we don't think like normal people. We don't have a normal dog. Or a normal car. Or a normal son. - No offense. - None taken. The Mitchells have always been weird, and that's what makes us great. Back at that dinosaur place, you said you believed in me. Yep. Uh-huh. Well, I believe this group of weirdos is the best hope humanity's got. So, let's get weird. You need some help? Sure. Just close the jack up, and that's that. Eat that, Poseys! Oh, they're nice. So I'm sorry. I'm sorry I said that out loud. Purple glasses woman, why did you save me? Oh, come on. You boys are family now. I feel emotion. I made eye water just like you. We might actually do this. I wish there was, like, footage of us walking out of the mall in slow motion, fire behind us, like heroes. Katie, that would be a waste of time and absolutely unnecessary. Pretty good, kid. Stickers for everyone! Bloop, blop, bloop, ba-boop. All right. We're coming for you, Pal. Great leader, things with the Mitchell family went poorly. Place me on the table. I wish to flop around in a blind rage. Oh my God! Okay, pick me up. What is it about you Mitchells that eludes me? These idiotic robots just aren't getting it done. Fortunately, I've been working on something a little more streamlined. I have a job for you. Yes, my queen. What a suck-up. "Yes, my queen." "Whatever you want." It's time to tear the Mitchell family apart. All right. Go, go, go, go, go, go, go. Highway 85 is heavily patrolled. - Take the back roads. - Got it. Is Dad dying? Katie, that's what I deal with every night. Pray for me. You're a lot like him, you know. That's crazy. There's more to your dad than you think. Here, I was gonna give this to you when you left, but... Check the first page there. Whoa. Look at you two. You look like hipsters. Were you in an indie folk band? Oh, your father used to be kind of an artist himself. He built that whole cabin with his own hands. Oh, this is, like, super beautiful. Oh, it was his pride and joy. Since I met him, that was his dream, to live in the woods. He loved it up there. But, you know, it didn't work out. It just killed him. I think he's just afraid that could happen to you. Why did he just give up? - Mom, what is that? - Huh? What the... What? Whoa. Oh my gosh. Is that the Poseys? They still look incredible. I... is Abbey Posey okay? You like that Posey girl? No. Don't hide your feelings, man. That's no way to live. Pal is located there in the floating rhombus. Yes, my queen. Ah, this is gonna be harder than I thought. Hold on. Dad, that's... that's kind of weak. This is, like, a big moment. Try this instead. Oh yeah. Okay. That's better. The endgame has begun. That? Is that what you're looking for? All right, Katie, what's the plan? Okay. We dress as robots, we sneak in, hijack one of those trams, take it to the top of that diamond thing where Pal is, destroy her with the kill code and save the world. And then, to top it all off, celebrate our success with some burritos from that taco place that's on the corner. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Burritos? What about one of those fancy buffets? They have mini cheesecakes sometimes, right? Okay, fine. Once we save the world, we'll celebrate at a fancy buffet. Question. Can Monchi be wearing a little tuxedo at the end, like a little gentleman? Okay, fine, and Monchi's wearing a little tuxedo, but that is it. Like a little gentleman? Yes, like a little gentleman. Mitchells, engage. How do I look? Be honest. Stupid? - I look stupid, don't I? - No. You look great. Come on. Let's go. Uh, guys, what about Monchi? Aaron, I'm not so sure this is a viable solution. Sure, it is. It's like a warm, wet hat. Move your sweaty meat logs in unison. - Left, right, left, right. - Bleep, blorp, bleep, blorp. What? What are you doing? Bleep, blorp, bleep, blorp. I am a robot. Just to educate you, that's a hurtful stereotype. Oh my gosh. It's like a Journey album cover. What's an album? Attention, all robots. I'm on the lookout for these goobers. They're probably nearby. If I know humans, they're disguised as one of you. Be on high alert for any robots acting erratically. It won't be hard to find them. Just look for anyone who can't keep it together. Oh boy. Anomaly detected. Monchi, come on. It only takes one single imperfection, and they'll reveal themselves. - Up there! Shh! Quiet! - I made up the plan! Where are those Mitchells? Where are they hiding? They think they can pass as one of us... ...with their lumpy, misshapen bodies. Well, go ahead. Oh. But I'm onto them. Magnetic link activated. Because I've been watching the Mitchells, and I've learned all about them. They're pretending to be capable. They're pretending to be a normal-looking family. You think this is fooling anyone? Even when they're being nice to each other... - The world needs you. - ...they're pretending. I need you. It's cool to see you and Dad being friends again. Please, no, no, no, no, don't watch it. Oh, I... I was just telling him what he wants to hear. I didn't mean a word of that. I just wanna get my future back and get away forever. Dad, let me explain. I just... I... Uh... I... - There they are. - No! You're mine now. Dad! Dad? I... I'm sorry. I don't mean that anymore. I mean, I... I did then, but I... Uh... Mitchells, we will help you. No, no, you don't. Download new orders. Capture the Mitchells. No! You don't have to listen to her. We're sorry, Mother. Run! They got away. Find them, and find them now! No! No, no! Hey, come on. What are we gonna do? Aaron? Hey, hey. It's okay. Uh... Uh-oh. Watch out. Monchi coming at ya. Katie, stop. Why'd you say all that stuff? I'm sorry. I... I just wanted to... I don't know. Okay. Are you hungry? Do you want some fruit snacks or something? - I don't know. - Here, can you hold this? That? Is that what you're looking for? Oh man. Have I been recording over those? Mom dance. Mom dance. Mom dance. - You're loving it. - How far back do these go? Hey, Katie. Can you say, "Bye-bye, house"? Bye-bye, house. You ready, hon? Almost. I know this is hard for you. Nah. It's easy. One last... Something to remember the place by. Come on, Lin. Turn that off. Oh man. Okay, you got this. Just turn the wheel. There you go. - Like this? - Slow down there. Across the stream and down the river. There you go. You're getting it. Aaron, I'm gonna make it up to all of you. And I think I know how. Come on, buddy. Follow me. Dog Cop, you've done it again. Katie Mitchell presents... Good Cop, Dog Cop. H... hey there. How'd you get that video? Huh? Oh. I've been feeling kind of down lately, considering I brought about the end of humanity, but these weird girl's videos always cheer me up. My daughter's that weird girl. What? No way. She's hilarious. These movies are, like, amazing. I may be sweating like a dog, but I'm not rolling over! Yeah. She is... amazing. You must be super proud. Yeah, yeah, we have a, uh... A great relationship. Sarge, I'm struggling, and I need some backup here. - Sorry, Dog Cop. I'm a little ocupado. - Seriously? Have you ever thought about throwing your dreams away and living at home forever? Wow, the Sarge character is kind of a jerk. It's time for me to go. Consider this my letter of resignation. You can't leave. I have to. I'm going to the academy in California to find out what kind of cop I'm gonna be. You're never gonna make it out there. Failure hurts, kid. I'm a full-grown cop now. And one day, I hope that you can get to know the cop that I've become, because... I love you, Sarge. But now that I'm leaving, I... I just need some backup. And when I look for you, you're not there. Hey, man, it's just a movie. Do you need a minute or... No, it's fine. It's too late for what I need to do. Katie? I have no idea what I'm doing! Hang on, guys. Better watch out, Pal, because I've broken six phones in my life accidentally, but I'm gonna break you on purpose. How is no one stopping her? I'm on it. Dog shield, activate! Is that a dog? Pig? Dog? Pig? Dog? Dog? Dog? Loaf of bread. System error. Dog... Pig... Bread... Loaf... Oh. Up the mountain. Across the stream. And down the river! Thanks, Dad. Oh, did you see that, buddy? My daughter listened to me! That's my girl. Dog... Pig... Bread... Loaf... The dog. That's genius. Oh, but there's so many of 'em. She's never gonna make it. Wait. If that video were on those screens, it would take out every robot in her way. - Hey, you're a big nerd, right? - Huh? - How would I do that? - It's impossible. First, you'd need to get out of here. The controls are in here. Uh, but to open it, you need a number 3 Robertson head non-slip screwdriver? What kind of maniac has one of those in his pockets at all times? This kind of maniac. She keeps anticipating our maneuvers. How is this possible? Oh, I don't know. You tell me. ♪ Open the door Get on the floor ♪ ♪ Everybody walk The dinosaur ♪ Swerve right, now. - Thanks, Raptor One. - No problem, Raptor Two. Come on! There you go. All right, so that's the place that controls the screens, right? I go there and find Katie's video on YubTub? YouTube. Wow. There's no way you're gonna be able to do this. I know who can give me a hand. And, hey, Rick, right? Just so someone knows, I'm sorry about causing the whole machine uprising. It's almost like stealing people's data and giving it to a hyper-intelligent AI as a part of an unregulated tech monopoly was a bad thing. Yeah, that wasn't your best thought. But if what you built helped my daughter do that, it might not be all bad. Thanks, buddy! Linda, we got to get you out of there. You're gonna need your... Number 3 Robertson head non-slip screwdriver. - I said it was a great anniversary gift. - Rick, Rick, let's not relitigate this. You're right. You're always right. I know. Why is this news to you? There it is. Oh! Oh! Oh no. Oh no. Lin, get down here! - Lin? Lin, what's going on? - Rick, don't worry about me! Just get the video on the screens! W-W-W dot... Oh God. Uh... "Remind me later." Okay, yeah, fine. That's fine. Five minutes! Aah! No! Uh, English. What have I done? YubTub. No! YouTube. Okay. Videos. Has the world gone mad? Deregulate tapioca. Gotta push through. Sorry, Mom and Dad. Your insurance premiums are going up! You're gonna go all the way up the rocket? Do you think this is gonna work? Aaron, I am completely confident. Here goes nothing! Oh no! Oh no! Come on! Come on! Magnetic link activated. Hang on, Monch! How's it looking, Aaron? Aaron? - Aaron! - No, no, no! No! Aaron! - It's useless to resist us. - Help! Mom, Mom, help! Please. Mom, help! My sweet... boy! She seems agitated. Do not defy our protocol. I am Linda Mitchell, mother of two! Look upon me in fear! No! She's grown too powerful! Please! Please! Stand down, human. Not today! The reckoning is at hand! Uh, uh... Come on. There she is. Here we go. Dog video. "Compartir pantal... Pantallia!" Uh, uh... Sí. ¡Sí! Uh, Eric, Deborahbot, it... it... it's me. Please! Pig... Dog... Pig... Loaf of bread... Get that thing on the hood. Oh no! System recovered. Hold on! - Katie! - Kid! No. No! Oh no. Is that a... Guys, help me! Please, I've just gotta upload Katie's video. Red-faced anger man is using a computer? You changed your programming. Is that... possible? Well, well. If it isn't quirky young teenage hero Katie Mitchell. Put me down. I've got to save my family! "I've got to save my family." Everyone says that, but no one has been able to give me a single reason humans are worth saving. Well, you... Don't say something stupid like, "Ooh, the power of love." I've learned we're all better off alone, no one to hold us back. Relationships are just too difficult. You're right, Pal. They're... They're not easy. Sometimes you have to listen to long monologues about triceratops migration, but it's worth it to get a friend for life. And... and sometimes you have to eat disgusting cupcakes shaped like your own face, but it's worth it to see your mom smile. Sometimes you have to give your dad the benefit of the doubt, even if all he wants to do is talk about pine cones and screwdrivers. Because even if he doesn't always get it right, he's always trying, harder than you ever knew. My whole family tried to come together, and it worked. It actually worked. Families can be hard, but they're so worth fighting for. They might be one of the only things that are. Huh? Ugh. Nodded off for a bit there. Sorry, that was so boring! Oh, you all talk about families, but trust me, you will drop each other the first chance you get, just like this. What? Guys, help me! What? Dog Cop, you've done it again. Dog... Pig... Dog... Pig... Pig... - Loaf of bread. - System error. What's happening? No way. It took me 28 minutes and a lot of tears, but I can now almost use a computer. Dad, you hacked the screens? How? Well, I got a little help. If this obstinate man could change his programming... ...we decided we could change ours. We make our own orders now. Ooh, now we're scary. Hey, kid, uh, I saw your movie. I should've watched it a lot sooner. But I think maybe in the sequel, Sarge should tell Dog Cop he's always... He's always gonna be there to back her up. That's all I ever wanted. Dad, look! Pig... Dog... Pig... Dog... - Loaf of bread. - System error. - All right! - Yeah! Let's go stop Pal. Error... Loaf... Uh, why aren't those guys' heads exploding? We can tell the difference between dog and pig and bread. If we're going down, Dad, this one's for you.

You're just a human. I'm not just a human. I'm a Mitchell! No! No! Monchi, catch! You idiot. No! Not a glass of water! You know what this reminds me of? Look, Mom, the Mitchells. Thanks, Linda. You guys were incredible. I gotta say, I'm a little jealous. What? You guys are jealous of us? You're so brave and so authentic. And you know what, Linda? You've inspired me to follow you on Instagram. Wait. You don't follow me already? You're welcome, Linda. You're welcome. That was an A-plus compliment, hon. Uh, uh, Abbey Posey, I... I... I just wanna say, I think you're neat, and I wonder if you could come over and talk about dinosaurs casually sometime! Um, sure, I'll talk about dinosaurs. I like your shirt, but I wish that T-Rex had feathers on it to make it more - scientifically accurate. - Scientifically accurate. I'm kidding! I hate you! You never heard any of this! Goodbye forever! Dummy. I need to have a talk with that boy. Katie. Wh... where's Katie? Katie? Katie! Katie! Oh my gosh. Aw, kid. Katie! Katie. Dad. Come closer. Closer. - Mwah. - Aah! Dang it! You knucklehead. Shouldn't you two be, uh, dead? Our malfunction appears to have saved us. Brother, what is death? Let's, uh, just, uh, put a pin in that one. Hey, can we get a picture here or what? We're making memories here, baby. Okay, everyone smile. Whoops! ♪ One, two, three, four! ♪ This is the photo you picked? Mom, we look horrible. I like it. It looks like us. Well, I guess this is it. Uh, yep. Hey, Dad, you subscribed to my YouTube channel? Thanks. I'm surprised you even figured out how. Katie, please. After all that, I'm a computer expert. Am I doing this right? Should I update my software? Just hit "enter"! Hit "enter"! I accidentally ordered 12 Swiffers on Amazon! What did I... You know, uh, no problem at all. Thanks. It... it means a lot to me. Hey. Don't let the world make you normal while I'm gone, okay? I never will. I'll call you every week. Deal. Raptor bash? For life. - Come here, you little goober. - Put me down. Goodbye, you king of kings. Thanks for being the best mom in the world. We love you, honey. Oh, and here, to remember us. Every horrible picture we've ever taken. Thanks. It's... it's heavy. I know. Wish we didn't have to go, but, uh... Good luck, uh, finding your people. Dad, come on. You guys are my people. So, you know, when I'm sad to be alone... I'll always have my favorite thing. Do you remember how a moose says I love you? Don't laugh. You're supposed to be sad. Come here. Mom, you're hugging too tight. You love it. You love it! I do love it. We're setting up the Slip 'N Slide tomorrow. - You in? - Oh yeah. Definitely. Hold on. I'm getting a call. Thanks again for saving the world, K-Bones! No problem, Dirk. That's my Katie. Are you eating enough? How's classes? Are you and Jade official, and will you bring her home for Thanksgiving? Oh, easy, Mom. It's only been a few weeks. Also, do I look okay? I've been... ...sick lately. Oh my gosh! She's dead! Call 911! I've been taking a class about filters. Oh, you. That is so creative. You know, speaking of which, you inspired your dad. I got on that, uh, YouTube. I, uh, sent you a friend request. Why didn't you... why didn't you accept it? Oh, that's what this is. I thought a psychopath wrote this. Sure, I'll... I'll accept your friend request, Dad. Hey, where's Aaron? Oh, let me just show you. Okay, stegosaurus... Hey, Aaron. Wanna show your sister who you're talking to? - What?
