YOU KNOW, THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS THAT I THINK KOREANS ARE VERY PROUD OF CONCERNING THIS COUNTRY. AND THIS IS COMING FROM A COUNTRY THAT WAS IN DIRE POVERTY LESS THAN A CENTURY AGO. I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD ATTRIBUTE THE SUCCESS OF OUR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT TO THE HARD WORK ETHIC, BUT ALSO THE SACRIFICIAL NATURE OF THE OLDER GENERATION. THAT THEY WERE WILLING TO SACRIFICE LITERALLY ALMOST ANYTHING FOR THE SAKE OF THE GREATER GOOD. BUT AS A RESULT, THE MORAL FIBER OF THIS COUNTRY HAS NOW BECOME AN EMPTY SHELL OF WHAT WE USED TO BE. 10 MILLION CUSTOMERS PER YEAR. ESTIMATES HAVE ANYWHERE FROM HALF A MILLION TO 1.3 MILLION WOMEN AND GIRLS WHO ARE INVOLVED IN THE SEX INDUSTRY IN THIS COUNTRY RIGHT NOW. AND THE REASON WHY OF THE WORLD WILL NOT BE AWARE OF IT IS BECAUSE WE ARE VERY GOOD AS A KOREAN PEOPLE OF SAVING FACE AND PUTTING ON THE PROPER IMAGE OF WHAT LOOKS GOOD ON THE OUTSIDE. BUT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS IMPACTING EVERY WALK OF SOCIETY IN THIS COUNTRY. AND IT'S ONLY GONNA GET BIGGER UNLESS WE DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.
