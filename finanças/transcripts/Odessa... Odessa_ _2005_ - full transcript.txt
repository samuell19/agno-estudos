To the north of the Black Sea exists a city known as Odessa. ﻿Nobody knows why, but the name seems to emerge ﻿from the depths of grandmothers' tales, ﻿whose tirelessly repeated sentences still echo in adult ears. ﻿Once upon a time, long long ago... ﻿I remember life in Odessa ﻿as a dream, as a fairytale. ﻿I always see my city in my dreams. ﻿I always dream of being there. ﻿ODESSA... ODESSA ! ﻿Jewish Street I﻿'m here. ﻿Hello. ﻿Thank God, very well. ﻿Yes, I have such big news that I can't even say it. ﻿It's as if God performed a miracle. ﻿I've gone back to my youth. ﻿It's as if I was twenty years old. ﻿It's one of those miracles God creates, ﻿like with Hanukkah, with those candles ﻿that could burn one day ﻿but burned for seven. ﻿Thanks to my mother, I love all the women in the world. ﻿I was brought up on the radio. Mother would leave for work, ﻿and I would sit on the bed and listen to popular music. ﻿Mother took me to the theater and opera. ﻿I understood opera and music very early. I was a fanatic. ﻿I used to lie on the school bench while she was teaching, ﻿and the kids would say: "Anna Osipovna's boy ﻿probably won't live." ﻿She would teach while I lay there. Can you imagine? ﻿Pure alcohol. ﻿I believe in the Messiah. Why? ﻿Because the times are very dark, ﻿a man will come who must help us. ﻿very dark. ﻿The people can't stand it anymore. ﻿That's why I believe in the Messiah, ﻿and that's why I want to believe. ﻿In the Torah it says ﻿that a happy man is a man "of the law". ﻿This is a commandment. ﻿So they say a Messiah will come. ﻿It's been 6000 years and he hasn't come. ﻿They just made up the story that a man would come to save the world. ﻿They told people this so that they'd have hope and be good. ﻿The Red Army saved the world. ﻿I believe that the Red Army was the Messiah that saved the world... ﻿from Hitler. ﻿I don't agree. ﻿I know the Red Army worked in the world, ﻿and all that, ﻿but it wasn't the Messiah. There is only one Messiah. ﻿I can't see what the world is coming to, ﻿what kind of change is taking place. ﻿Why is it this way? I don't understand. ﻿I miss the community, all of us together. ﻿This is Moscow speaking: ﻿Today at 4 am, ﻿German armed forces ﻿attacked the capital of the USSR. ﻿The Great War of the Fatherland has begun ﻿against the German fascist enemy. ﻿A lot of people died of hunger during the war. ﻿So we said: We are farmers from the Ukraine, ﻿"we want to work on a collective farm." ﻿They gave us a Jewish "Kolkhoz", ﻿and we came to work. ﻿They gave us nothing for it. ﻿Everyone went to the Front... ﻿and gave their lives for their Motherland. We had to save our land... people saved other people, ﻿and so saved the whole world. ﻿So at 6 p.m. ﻿So we're inviting you to come at 6, if you can. ﻿Goodbye. ﻿Hello to everyone. ﻿He also sings, he is an opera singer. ﻿-Who? - A friend of mine. ﻿Surname? ﻿- Krivoruchka. It's her nephew. - Krivoruchka, "lame arm”! ﻿- You know him. - My God! ﻿Just don't marry him, they call him "krovonozhka", lame leg. ﻿Everyone says that but I don't care. ﻿In 1919... ﻿There is my father. ﻿We lived on the second floor, ﻿and there was also a first floor. ﻿Everyone knew ﻿that the White Army bandits would go to the second floor. ﻿The White Army? ﻿I thought it was the Red Army. ﻿The White, the Reds, all of them. ﻿The bandits came in and said, ﻿"Give me money." ﻿Father said he had none. ﻿The drunk bandit said: ﻿"Open your mouth" and he put a bullet through his brain. ﻿Seven children survived. ﻿My four brothers were all taken away. ﻿But God helped me ﻿because I had 3 sons in Odessa ﻿who carry the names of my brothers. ﻿I am... ﻿You can only see my ear. I drew the rest. ﻿My mother ﻿child, ﻿my sister in America, ﻿my daughter, grandfather, ﻿mother, ﻿mother, mother student... ﻿mother, mother. ﻿I could have made a living as an actress, ﻿but I became a teacher. ﻿Really? Oh, too bad. ﻿I worked as an actress. ﻿Danced, played. ﻿And it was so good. ﻿Because I live for dancing, ﻿for singing - you know? ﻿How many years? ﻿I did. ﻿No. How many years were you an actress? ﻿Twenty. ﻿How many - Twenty. ﻿A lot. ﻿When I saw you in the Jewish center, ﻿I immediately thought you were an actress. ﻿- When I danced? - Please dance now. ﻿You're worth more to me ﻿than life itself ﻿That means in Love! ﻿Honey, I am yours forever... ﻿She sings... She dances. She stands like a young woman, ﻿she dresses like a girl. ﻿She wears such high-heeled shoes... ﻿and she still has such good hair. ﻿- I think it's a wig. - A wig? ﻿Yesterday, when I saw her at the center, it was white, ﻿and today it is yellow. ﻿You're right. It's a wig. ﻿I even saw her looking in the mirror in the kitchen ﻿and arranging it. ﻿Shall I offer it around? ﻿No, you should eat it. ﻿Oh, she is so difficult! ﻿I tell everyone that. ﻿ I'll offer it around. ﻿I tell everyone how difficult she is! ﻿- Very difficult. - Very difficult. ﻿Please Madam, take one. ﻿- I should be offering it to you. - You offer to me and I to you. ﻿Thanks. ﻿Now we are going to study English. ﻿This room ﻿suits me. ﻿"English-Russian." ﻿My biggest problem is my apartment. ﻿If I could sign a contract with someone... ﻿so they'd help me out... ﻿I'm ready to work... ﻿I've seriously thought that I need to change something, ﻿go somewhere... ﻿Now my soul aches ﻿because Odessa is losing itself. ﻿﻿It's lost a lot.. ﻿People leaving... ﻿I'm going away again soon... ﻿- For a long time? - Forever. ﻿Maybe I'll come back. ﻿Israel is so beautiful, I want to leave. ﻿But you should be proud of Odessa. ﻿But that's all in the past. It already happened. ﻿But we have the Black Sea, ﻿Derebarevsky Street. ﻿Yes, of course, but I'm sick of it. It's all in the past. ﻿I﻿'m embarrassed. ﻿Once upon a time there was a king ﻿Who had a queen ﻿Sleep, my little child ﻿Sleep, my child ﻿The queen had a vineyard with a tree ﻿A vineyard with a tree ﻿And a bird nesting in its branches ﻿Sleep, my child ﻿My precious child ﻿Sleep, my child ﻿But the king died ﻿And the queen became desolate ﻿The branches broke and the bird flew away ﻿There are so many Jews here ﻿speaking Russian everywhere ﻿In Brighton Beach This wonderful place ﻿You have cured me of nostalgia for ever! ﻿In this place I feel at home ﻿It makes my other home feel so far away ﻿Brighton dear, you are my Odessa ﻿Where ocean water splashes on the shore ﻿Where all the kiosks are full of Russian papers ﻿Where all my best friends live ﻿It's so nice to go along the boardwalk ﻿And watch the waves in the ocean ﻿To do nothing else ﻿Than gazing at the couples walking by ﻿Odessa Mama loves Brighton Papa ﻿I know this for a fact ﻿If we didn't know that ﻿We wouldn't have come here ﻿Everything here is great like in Odessa ﻿Only there's no Privoz ﻿And Moldavanka and Peresy... ﻿Anyway, Brighton is about having fun ﻿Brighton dear, you are my Odessa ﻿When I was still in Odessa, my city, ﻿I knew the USA was a country full of great possibilities. ﻿But when I read letters from America, ﻿I understood that nothing is that simple. ﻿That nothing is really like it seems at first sight. ﻿And money doesn't grow on trees or lie around. ﻿I love you much too much ﻿You'll really never know ﻿I love you oh so much ﻿I love you more ﻿I love you oh so much ﻿That I could never hate you ﻿This is how much I feel for you ﻿The song about Odessa, ﻿it's called "Brighton you are my Odessa". ﻿My friend Mary wrote the lyrics. ﻿Dear Brighton Beach You're my Odessa ﻿Where ocean water splashes on the shore ﻿Where all the kiosks are full of Russian papers ﻿Where all my best friends live ﻿- Such beautiful words! - Yes. There are lots of names in here. ﻿All the famous shops and restaurants in Odessa. ﻿But it would be nice to sing it in a proper place. ﻿I did not have one sunny day here, ﻿a day that I managed to do something real in New York. ﻿And having written and arranged all these songs... ﻿I just didn't get the right response. The audience. ﻿In America, there's a constant chase for dollars, ﻿while in other places there are no rich or poor... ﻿There is no envy of each other. ﻿A toast to our beautiful Odessa! ﻿To Odessa Mama! ﻿Why "Odessa Mama" ﻿There's no better mother than an Odessan. ﻿Odessa has raised us like a mother. ﻿Let's drink to Odessa Mama! ﻿There was a man called Ilyusha The Teacher. ﻿He taught at a club on Rosa Luxembourg St. ﻿Treisin was a 3rd degree boxer, ﻿already a professional boxer. ﻿Ilya said: "To become a real boxer, go to Treisin", so I did. ﻿Then Treisin gives me such a hit - I tell you guys, I flew ﻿a couple of meters. - Rright to the wall. ﻿Of course I got up and said: ﻿"You throw a mean punch!" ﻿But when I hit him back, believe you me, ﻿he stayed on the floor. ﻿That day I started to learn boxing. ﻿One time I had a confrontation ﻿with a general from the KGB. ﻿I was training young boxers in Moscow and he didn't pay my boys. ﻿The general said something he shouldn't have. ﻿And I just couldn't restrain myself. I hit him. ﻿I didn't choose to leave. They sent me to exile. ﻿When I lived in Israel from 1991-1993, ﻿I worked as a builder. ﻿I worked with Arabs. We built houses together ﻿and became real friends. ﻿I'm no politician, but I can't understand ﻿what's going on there now. ﻿﻿I came here from Israel, ﻿I work in a furniture store, carrying things. ﻿I work 6-7 days a week. ﻿America is the best country in the world. ﻿America takes care of my parents, ﻿even if they didn't do anything for it. ﻿-Are you selling this "Samovar"? - Definitely. Take it! ﻿- How much do you want for it? - 3 Rubles. ﻿Let's have a look. ﻿-Are you from Odessa? - Yes. ﻿I'm an Odessan, too. ﻿You can have anything here. ﻿Let's have a look. ﻿- Like these beads? They're antique. - Yes. They are beautiful. ﻿-That'll be $7. - I'll take it. ﻿I﻿'m Russian. ﻿was born in 1922 in Odessa. ﻿Now I live in America. ﻿But I can't think of myself as an American ﻿if I can't say a word in American. ﻿came here and America gave me ﻿an apartment in Program 8. ﻿I also got money... America is good. ﻿Hey granny, what's your name? ﻿You look just like Brigitte Bardot! ﻿Grandma, come and sit with me. ﻿She's fresh off the boat. ﻿Doesn't she know it's warm now? ﻿She thinks it's Siberia. ﻿You're in Brighton now! ﻿I want to go over the Brooklyn Bridge. ﻿Living uptown. ﻿Do you remember the liver pies we had in Odessa? ﻿The ones with cereal? ﻿We'll have.them here^so.on. ﻿Can I taste just a small-piece £>f this? ﻿I haven't tried ftjn ages. ﻿I'm so happy to see you. ﻿Have you been to the market? ﻿Yes. I've bought "Bychki" with food stamps. How are you doing? ﻿I don't get food stamps. ﻿﻿I came here 10 years ago. ﻿So why don't you get food stamps? ﻿I applied for a green card in 1998. ﻿went to an interview. ﻿﻿I told the man I came from Israel. ﻿He said he was a German officer... ﻿He told me to give him my passport. ﻿And then my papers were shelved. ﻿-Why? - It's been years now. ﻿I can only earn enough for bills. ﻿That's what America gives me. ﻿was born in Odessa in 1939. ﻿Before the war my father was ﻿General Secretary of Regional Committee. ﻿When my parents left in the war, ﻿they forgot to take me. ﻿The Russian woman who took me in ﻿said: ﻿"If you're a Jew, you must be strong". ﻿So I decided to be a boxer. ﻿﻿I was 17 ﻿when I volunteered to go to the Front. Odessa was blockaded. ﻿Everyone had left by then, but my father said ﻿nothing would happen with the Germans. ﻿I left Odessa with the last ship... ﻿All the people in this picture ﻿died. ﻿Today at 4 am, German armed forces ﻿have attacked the capital of the USSR. ﻿The great war for the Fatherland ﻿against the German fascist army has begun. ﻿A city full of acacia blossom ﻿At the Black Sea shore.. ﻿Stop singing and go home! ﻿Look at this guy ﻿with an umbrella and suit. Wow! ﻿My opinion of the Russians is ﻿they're arrogant people, want everything for nothing. Freeloaders! ﻿This bench is American people. ﻿Next bench is Russian people. ﻿There's a synagogue on 4th Street. ﻿If we can give a dollar to each one of the Russians, ﻿they wouldn't go inside there! ﻿They're not used to the Jewish ways, so.. ﻿There's nothing left here no more. Everything is just a memory. ﻿And now everything is gone. ﻿Come on, Charlie! Let's go! ﻿Babel created the name Mishka Yaponchik. ﻿There was a bandit heading the mafia, ﻿but Mishka Yaponchik was not his name. ﻿Mishka Yaponchik was born in Odessa... ﻿...so it's like not being born at all. ﻿He was a really famous name in Odessa. Almost a legend. ﻿Forget the mafia! ﻿Jews have their own bandits! ﻿If Jews didn't have their own thieves ﻿and prostitutes they wouldn't be a nation. ﻿We call this place Little Odessa. ﻿Odessa is different now... ﻿but we still love Odessa. ﻿They sent me a long questionnaire. ﻿I have to study these 100 questions. ﻿And I met with a nice officer who asked me many questions. ﻿﻿I've had a hard life. ﻿I always found myself moving from place to place. ﻿I want to be a citizen of this country. ﻿In your hand I see a very very long life. A long future. ﻿Long? Thank you, darling. ﻿It shows you're smiling in the face but not in your heart. ﻿Yes. ﻿- You're very troubled. Very confused. - Yes! ﻿You have somebody you miss very much. ﻿Absolutely. ﻿- He'll always be there. - Yes... ﻿- You met many. - Yes... ﻿But he will always stay in your heart and mind. ﻿Absolutely. Right. ﻿It shows here you were born to help others. ﻿To do good for others. ﻿But not everybody treats you the same. - Absolutely. ﻿And that makes you nervous. ﻿It makes you feel very uncomfortable. ﻿Do you want to move? ﻿- Move? - To a new home? ﻿To a new home, yes, but I don't have... ﻿It shows "Be patient". ﻿Not this year. ﻿But next year. ﻿Thank you very much! ﻿There will be a new atmosphere. A better place for you. ﻿Thanks darling! ﻿Now you can ask me one question, whatever you feel, ﻿and if I see - I'll tell you. ﻿Do you think I will be with this... to whom I say with my heart? ﻿It shows he is your soul mate. You'll always be with him. ﻿will be with him? ﻿You'll always be with him. Together, spiritually. ﻿- But together, on Earth... - No... ﻿- You have to move on. You understand? - Yes... ﻿- But he will always love you. - Yes... ﻿-And you will always love him. - Yes. ﻿- But together, no? - On this Earth, no. ﻿On this Earth, no. Exactly! ﻿- But on the other side, yes. - Exactly! ﻿Because he is your soul mate. ﻿You're somebody! ﻿And don't worry. Don't grieve. ﻿But make most of your decisions on these 2 days: ﻿Friday and Saturday are your two lucky days. ﻿Friday and Saturday. ﻿Make most of your decisions on those two days. ﻿- Good luck. - Thank you. You're somebody, the best! ﻿- It's true. What you say is true. - I told you, it's for real! ﻿For real. For real! Thank you! Thank you very much. ﻿No no, thank you! I want to say thank you. That's it! Done. Fine. ﻿Please look left. ﻿At the end of Wall Street ﻿you will see Trinity Church. ﻿6 billion dollars... ﻿The New York Stock Exchange has a daily trade of... ﻿The Twin Towers were so nice! ﻿Yes. They were wonderful. ﻿And so high! ﻿In the USSR even 5-floor buildings would collapse. ﻿Well, this is America! ﻿When I came and saw the skyscrapers, I couldn't believe my eyes! ﻿- Is this your first time in Manhattan? - Yes. ﻿Who'd have come with me? Would I have come alone? ﻿No, you can come back with your son. ﻿Have you really never been here? - No. ﻿We'll have about an hour to walk around, ﻿so take your cameras and water bottles. ﻿It's beautiful. Really chic! ﻿- I like this view. I can see the Statue of Liberty. ﻿- Look at it. - It's so high and grandiose! ﻿It's the symbol of American freedom. ﻿That's why everybody loves America. ﻿﻿It gives so much freedom. ﻿New York's the most beautiful city! ﻿This is why everyone loves it so much. ﻿I see Odessa in my dreams. ﻿I knew every stone there, ﻿﻿I even knew how to throw them... Where to go, how to go... ﻿I might have returned to Odessa ﻿if I didn't have a son here. ﻿I always see my city in my dreams. ﻿I always dream of being there. ﻿feel what we call in Russian ﻿"Nostalgia". ﻿People tell me to "Go there and it will pass". ﻿Maybe it will. And maybe it won't. ﻿In general, Ashdod is a nice and large city. ﻿This is "Yud", one of its districts. Districts "Yud", "Aleph" and "Vav" ﻿are closed communities, with hardly any exceptions. ﻿Mostly Russians live in "Yud". ﻿"Zayin" has the Orthodox Jews. On Shabbat, cars don't even go around there, it's forbidden. ﻿"Vav" has Ethiopians. ﻿"Yud Aleph" a more comfortable district, ﻿has native Israelis and Moroccans. ﻿I﻿t's all divided. ﻿The city is beautiful indeed. And the job is just a job. ﻿I ﻿have a stable income. ﻿Every morning ﻿I go and sweep the streets. ﻿Where did you come from? ﻿same from Kiev, Ukraine. ﻿Zossia, where did you immigrate from? ﻿I came from Russia. city of Saratov. ﻿Lucia, where did you come from? ﻿﻿I came from Ukraine, from Odessa. ﻿- The city of... - From the city of Odessa, ﻿on the Black Sea.. ﻿We have two homes. ﻿What does it mean for us ﻿to come to Jerusalem? We came to our homeland. ﻿How do we call this fairytale land? ﻿"Eretz Israel". ﻿That's right, Eretz Israel. ﻿"Eretz" is "country". ﻿Dina and David are Israelis. ﻿And we? What are we? ﻿"We are also Israelis"! ﻿Remember hew we prepared to go to Israel? ﻿We tried to study the language. ﻿We paid a woman named Sarah to teach us. ﻿She told us it's a happy place. ﻿She described it as a Paradise on Earth. ﻿- I didn't want to come here at all! - It took me ages to persuade you! ﻿Then we arrived ﻿at "Ben Gurion" airport, and what a welcome we received! ﻿I just stood there on the stairs and cried. ﻿I fell in love with this country at first sight! ﻿Right there I was sure that everything would	here. ﻿And we didn't knew where to go when we came out of the airport. ﻿We came on a Friday evenimg. Nothing works then. We found a hotel in Ashdod. It was their "Shabbat". ﻿But we suffered so much! ﻿At first people Looked askanoe at us... ﻿We didn't understand why they didn't accept us. ﻿In Odessa there was only one nationality, Odessan. ﻿But here? "You're Russian! A Russian!" ﻿We must help this country achieve unity. ﻿Unity? What unity? They don't even have a constitution here! ﻿All they have is this supreme court, the "Bagatz", to solve all problems. ﻿- You talk like a communist! - Don't interrupt me! ﻿I used to be a communist. Now I'm an internationalist! ﻿I don't care about color or nationality. ﻿My husband Vladimir missed Odessa very much. ﻿He started to collect picture after picture ﻿for the Odessa Museum. ﻿He went to all the libraries. ﻿It took him five-six years. ﻿He did it all with his own hands. ﻿He loved Odessa. He knew every building. ﻿He loved Odessa. He lived with Odessa. ﻿Odessans are like that. They say, "Odessan" is a nationality. Back in Russia, if someone said "Jew", we'd look down at our feet. ﻿We felt exiled, humiliated. I thought Israel is a Jewish paradise. ﻿A place where everyone lives together in peace, ﻿where everybody is Jewish. ﻿Then I got here and I saw Russians, Moroccans, Georgians, Ethiopians... The Moroccans don't like Russians. ﻿The Russians don't like Ethiopians. ﻿The Ethiopians don't like Georgians... ﻿How can it be worse? Who killed Rabin? ﻿Wasn't it a Jew? ﻿"Ashdod Beach Hotel" ﻿was very hard to find. ﻿I need to arrange it by composers, you see? All this collection. ﻿- What Tchaikovsky pieces are there here? - All of them. ﻿It's in this CD. Let's place it... ﻿Even "Swan Lake"? ﻿Of course. I told you. A complete collection. ﻿- Music was always a part of you. - It was. ﻿But with the music seene here. ﻿This African-Moroccan music they play here... It's so vulgar! ﻿Alexander was an Israeli soldier, serving on the border. ﻿This is what his mother told our reporter... ﻿Poor woman. ﻿To lose a son like that... ﻿Let me listen to the news. ﻿The Russians are in the news again... ﻿It's his duty to be a soldier. ﻿Yes, but he was a guard. He saved lives... ﻿Number 24. ﻿33. ﻿36. ﻿What I don't like about Israel is all the dirt on the streets. ﻿And I don't like the terrorist aspect here. ﻿Well, does anyone? ﻿﻿I don't like the heat' ﻿These terrorists, when will th'ey leave us in peace? ﻿Who is our prime minister? ﻿Sharon. ﻿Move it! We have a game to play! ﻿It's Bella's turn now, not mine. ﻿Why don't they do something with that Arafat? ﻿He looks like a scarecrow. ﻿I can't understand you. All you watch is Russian TV, when this country has ﻿economic problems and suicide bombings. ﻿And you watch that, like you're still there. ﻿It's our country too, in a way, but it doesn't care about us at all. ﻿﻿I don't understand ﻿why you are only interested in Russian politics. ﻿Well, Kira, I lived there most of my life. ﻿I can't change as easily as you can. ﻿I listen to Russian radio because I can't speak Hebrew. ﻿I know you are an Israeli, not a Russian. ﻿You're so attached to Russia as if it's your homeland, ﻿but your real homeland is Israel. ﻿It's not just words. ﻿If this wasn't Irue we could have gone to America. ﻿I keep all your grandfather's medals from when he was in the army... ﻿Will you show me? ﻿He got this medal in 1990, for the war... ﻿And this was the Homeland's medal. ﻿This cap looks so much like mine! ﻿It's only folded a bit differently. ﻿I saw his uniform. It also looked just like mine. ﻿Come, try it on. No, you should do it like this... ﻿"Integration Street" ﻿Hello, happy Independence Day! ﻿May the Messiah come and revive our dead, ﻿and then bring us peace. ﻿I'd like to buy the book, the Bible. Do you have it? ﻿- Do you have it in Russian? - English and Russian. ﻿Praise the Lord. Now we have everything. ﻿Do you also have a large picture of Rabbi Nachman of Breslav? ﻿I ﻿have this one here.. ﻿Praise the Lord, now we have everything. ﻿- Do you want it? - Yes, I want to buy it. How much is it? ﻿- 20 Shekels. ﻿...Around 250,000 Israelis over 15 are illiterate. ﻿Never finished 4th grade. ﻿A quarter of a million in Israel. ﻿Not in Honolulu! ﻿Right here in Israel, a progressive and enlightened country. ﻿A country that invented a watermelon without seeds... ﻿Goodbye. Shalom from God Almighty! ﻿Rag and bone! Rag and bone! ﻿Old beds, cupboards, tables, ovens, sewing machines.... ﻿Shalom! ﻿What do you have here? I see a phone. What's this? ﻿This is a samovar from Odessa. Where are you from? ﻿I'm an Arab Bedouin from Beer Shieva. How much do you want? ﻿50 Shekel's. ﻿- 50 is too much ﻿I'll give you 30. -30? No. ﻿- So I'll give you 40. Is it a deal? - Alright. ﻿May the Messiah come to us! ﻿Dear Jews! Today the Shabbat w.ill start, at 7:09 pm... ﻿- What's that? - It's a samovar. ﻿What's it good for? ﻿People use it to warm water for tea. ﻿Where can you sell such a thing? ﻿Dunno. Maybe to some Jews in Tel Aviv. ﻿Shabbat ends tomorrow at 8:13 pm. ﻿The first time ﻿I went to work as a sweeper was horrible. ﻿was naive at the time. ﻿I thought we could create some artistic groups and give concerts. ﻿I remember life in Odessa ﻿as a fairytale. ﻿used to be a real fanatic for the stage ﻿and performed a lot in comic venues. ﻿There are many interesting types in Odessa ﻿But there's no person like Mishka Yaponchik. He is unique! ﻿I've known many pretty women I really can't complain ﻿That's my life And my life is quite sweet ﻿And if some bad guy comes around ﻿I will silence him - for good ﻿Yes, this is life, dear gentlemen ﻿And to make up for these things I do... ﻿Look, it's Victory Day today. Let's sing. ﻿We worked to make it happen ﻿This Victory Bay With its gunpowder scent... ﻿It's strange that nobody in this country ﻿knows'what that holiday is today. ﻿Especially because without this holiday, ﻿the state of Israel wouldn't even exist. ﻿Let's drink to those who are no longer with us today. ﻿They will always be with us in our thoughts. ﻿There's a song that goes like this: ﻿Let us bow to them, friends, ﻿Everyone all over the world... ﻿was born in 1934. ﻿I'm going to be 70 this year... ﻿My parents were killed in 1944. ﻿Father was 27. ﻿Mother was 21. ﻿Today at 4 am. ﻿German armed forces ﻿attacked the borders of the USSR. ﻿The great war for the Fatherland ﻿against the German fascist army has begun. ﻿Here is an important announcement: ﻿Today, April' 10, 1944, ﻿we have taken control of our nation's ﻿most important strategic region: Ukraine. ﻿Odessa was in my husband's blood. He had a violent nostalgia for it. ﻿In time it seemed to calm down a bit. But at first... ﻿But then he said he couldn't die without seeing Odessa again. ﻿So he went there. And it wasn't easy. ﻿It's true, ﻿what they say: "Nostalgia is nostalgia". ﻿I love my city. Always have and always will. ﻿I plan to go there, ﻿see the city, ﻿breathe its air. ﻿To look at the Opera I grew up in. ﻿That's it. ﻿My mother is buried here. ﻿In the Holy Land.

Odessans! ﻿I know you need support ﻿Let me give you some... That's all I can spare. ﻿Odessa-, my sunny eity ﻿At the Black Sea shore... ﻿We left Odessa because that's what everyone did at that time. ﻿Jews are always on the road. ﻿But if we were Jews there, ﻿here we are Russians. ﻿Our children will be Israelis. ﻿This is the news from lsrael+, the Russian channel. ﻿Today we commemorate these who died ﻿in Israel's wars anti in terrorist attacks. One hour ago, all over Israel, we heard the sirens ﻿which marked the start of memorial day. ﻿Near Jerusalem's Wailing Wall, a ceremony took place ﻿attended by Government members and Israel's representatives. ﻿10 Shekels! 10 Shekels!
