Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Ah Kiao, now, that you're all grown up, you have to listen to your parents, understand? Okay. Make a wish! I want to be a star when I grow up. It won't come true if you say it aloud! Do it again! I want to be a star when I grow up. It doesn't matter. All right, blow out the candles! One, two, three! Grandma! Good girl. Grandma, this show is addictive! You're reading magazines, anyway. Are you daring me to hit you? I want to watch that drama series. Grandma, look. Dinner time! We are having a big feast tonight! Today, Auntie Chilli gave birth. Uncle Satay made a bet with me on whether it will be a boy or a girl. Of course I won. Aunty Chilli's stomach was so pointed, of course it had to be a boy! That Uncle Satay is a newcomer. He doesn't know my prowess! Why? None of you are hungry? Going on a fast? Let's eat. Wow! Today, we have chicken, pork, mutton, all kinds of meat! Why? It's good enough we've got food to eat. Business is so bad these days. I don't see you guys bringing a bit more money home for me. I've been wearing this blouse for over ten years! Luckily your blouse is not worth much. Otherwise, you'd gamble it away, too. If you're not happy, you can always ask your father to come back from Singapore to feed you! With the little money you make from selling pirated DVDs, you think you can support the family? All right, no fighting while eating rice. But there's no rice on the table! I'll get "comstipation" from eating so much meat. It's "constipation." Fann Wong said it in Chronicle Of Life. Don't be stupid. Fann Wong's pronunciation is seldom accurate. But that show was dubbed. Comstipation, so what? Constipation. Are you daring me to hit you? All right, no toilet talk during meal time. Ah Leng, next time when you bet, make sure you bet with the vegetarian food seller. Let's eat. Here, Grandma. - Hello? - Hello. You want to buy a television? Of course I'm buying a television. I wouldn't be buying toilet bowls here, right? Are you deaf? This is a 26-inch, 1,099 ringgit. This is a 32-inch LED, 1,299 ringgit. This is also a 32-inch LCD, 1,899 ringgit. This is a 46-inch, 4,899 ringgit, but you can pay in 12 monthly installments. This is also a 46-inch, but Christopher Lee looks more handsome in this set, so, it's a bit more costly, 5,299 ringgit. Which television set do you want to buy? Grandma, this is Christopher Lee Meng Soon. He is a big star in Singapore. He's from Melaka. Ah Soon. Grandma, this is David Gan. He's a hair stylist for many celebrities in Singapore. He's from Segamat. Ah David. And, Grandma, here on the cover, we have Singapore's most popular artiste, and she's from Yong Peng! Ah Kiao. You know your mother doesn't like you to go to Singapore. I know, it's all because of Daddy. It's okay. Grandma supports you. Ah Kiao Sis... Look, I got 90 marks for my essay! Wow! Fatty's so smart! Let me have a look! "My Ambition. My ambition is to be an international ballerina. I love how graceful ballerinas are when they are dancing. They are as..." As lithe as a swallow! Wow! Fatty's Chinese is awesome! Yes! "Ever since I watched Swine Lake on TV..." It's Swan Lake, not Swine Lake. - Swine Lake. - "Swan Lake." - Swine Lake. - "Swan Lake." Forget it! Yes! Swan Lake! "Ever since I watched Swan Lake on TV... I just fell in love with ballet. Once, my school organized a musical. I acted as a tree. I really loved the feeling of being on stage. I was not nervous at all." - Really? - Of course! So, are you taking ballet lessons now? Why not? Mommy doesn't let me. She says ballet's for girls. Moreover, I'm so fat, it'll just be a waste of money. Grandma, what are you looking for? The Kingdom and The Beauty. The Kingdom and The Beauty again? You've seen it umpteen times! There's a remake! Starring Kelly Chen, Donnie Yen and Leon Lai. I'll help you find it! No, I want to see the original. It's got my superstar, Zhao Lei. You know, he used to court me... and even wanted me to marry him. Yes, I know... He's your ex-boyfriend. If not for my mom, I would have married him already. If you had married him, you wouldn't have to eat satay every day. People should just follow their dreams when they are young. Don't think too much. And when they are old? When they are old, they will just have to watch others follow their dreams. Grandma, do you know what my dream is? I know. You want to be a star. Do you think I can make it? Why not? You're beautiful and young. And you watch so much TV. Don't talk anymore. Help me find my Kingdom and The Beauty quick. Okay. You like it? I told Grandma to sew two swimsuits together. Smart, eh? What's wrong? You don't like the color? Mommy won't let me take lessons, and I'm so fat. It's useless! Don't be like this. Where there's a will, there's a way. Let me tell you a story. Is it a ghost story? Mommy says I'm not allowed to listen to ghost stories. I'll have nightmares. It's not a ghost story, it's a true story! And a beautiful one. Once upon a time, there was a boy who loved ballet just like you. But everybody said he looked like a sissy when he danced. What is a "sissy"? Well, it's like effeminate. What's "effeminate"? Effeminate is... something like that! People used to tease me and I would cry. But now, I keep it all inside. I'll prove you wrong. David Gan does ballet, too? No! Anyway, everyone said this boy danced like a girl. So, his dad was like your mom, and forbade him from doing ballet. But he was very determined. He kept practicing and even got a scholarship to the Royal... Whatever ballet college. Eventually, he became a world-renowned ballet star! Ah Kiao Sis, are you talking about Billy Elliot? Yes, I think so. That's just a movie! It's not real! Silly! Some movies are based on true stories! So, Black Swan was real, too? Your mom took you to watch that movie? I kept begging her to take me, but she refused. So I told your brother I love to watch ballet movies and he gave me the pirated DVD. Wow! That Black Swan was awesome! She kept practicing until she became a ballet star. And she was both Black Swan and White Swan! That's right! If you keep practicing, you can one day be a ballet star, too! But she danced till she died on stage. And she died a horrible death. That's just a movie. It's not real. What? So, Billy Elliot is not real either? I'm so confused. I'm going home to do my homework. Otherwise, I'm going to get another beating from my mom. I'll prove to you one day, even if I'm a sissy, or whatever you call it, as long as I lead a better life than you, I win. BRILLIANT TALENT SHOW Ah Kiao, I've got something for you. Grandma, why aren't you asleep? This is for you. What is it? It's a gift from my superstar boyfriend, Zhao Lei. I can't keep this! Take it, keep it. Is this your face? Is this your face or your boyfriend's face? Look carefully, it's a Chinese character! It's not a happy face? It's "longevity." What do you think it means? Your boyfriend wants you to have a long life? What's the use of having a long life if you don't get to do what you love? What would be the meaning of life? Longevity would mean nothing. You know, my superstar boyfriend once said to me... "Are you afraid of the dark? If you are, you have not tasted the bittersweetness of life." Grandma, I don't think it was your ex-boyfriend who told you that. Doesn't matter, just take it. Anyway, your mom will gamble it away one day. In that case, I'll safeguard it for you first. All right, I'm going to bed. Be careful! Okay. Don't sleep too late. ZOE AND FANN ARE THEY FRIENDS OR COLLEAGUES? "Zann." Quite a nice name! Do you want to be a star? Don't wait anymore! Now's your chance! If you want to be the star of tomorrow... come down to Suntec Singapore this weekend. Starz Search, where your dreams come true. Ah Kiao! Stop sleeping like a pig. Come and sell DVDs with me if you've nothing better to do. Kiao! I'VE GONE TO SINGAPORE TO BE A STAR - LEE KAR KIAO Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Starz Search! Wow, you have potential! Your skirt is very special! Stay in line and don't cut the queue! But most importantly, get your $20 application fee ready! Must be the exact amount. We've no change for you, okay? Hey! Stand in line! $20! The judge today is very kind. It's Xiang Yun. - Thank you! - Okay. 355! 361, Lee Kar Kiao, 361! I'm 361. Zann! You can't take part. Why can't I? Don't you watch TV? The stars at our TV station are mostly from China and Malaysia. Our local audiences are getting frustrated! No foreigners allowed this year. You didn't state that clearly in your TV ad. Of course we did! Look at our huge logo. Starz Search. "S" for Singapore. There's no "M" for Malaysia! Only Singaporeans can take part! Where did she come from? Where's my $20? Oh, my God! Singapore is so hot! I'm sweating all the time! I don't know how the people here keep their clothes on! Yeah, and everyone is supposed to speak English, yet the cab drivers never understand us. Maybe you should try saying "lah" after everything. Well, okay, lah. We have to be in the Sengkang in ten minutes, lah. Let's go! Caucasians are really gorgeous. I think they're twins. There's no problem. We'll get her for you. Sure, no problem! Don't worry, I'll call you when I'm free. Yes, sure. Yes, she's free, no problem at all. Excuse me? Can I help you? Are you looking for models? Did you call to make an appointment? No, I got your address from Yellow Pages. Did you bring any pictures? Yes. Your features are very nice, but if you want to be one of our models, you have to join our deportment course. That's the basic modelling course. $400. $400. After that, you have to take the professional modelling course, $600. $600. If you sign up for both the courses now, it's only $800. $800. After that, you have to take pictures for your portfolio, but you don't have to do that here. You can find your own photographer, but it's more expensive. We can recommend a photographer. We will provide the hair and makeup. It's only $500. It's more expensive out there, ours is only $500. You will get 36 shots, but we will keep the negatives. So, how? It costs so much to be a model? You think it's free? I'll show you my personal photos for reference. Take a look. Wow! You look gorgeous! Gorgeous, right? Our photographer is very good and classy. The makeup is fantastic, too. Take a closer look, they say I resemble an artiste. She's very popular! You look like Patricia Mok! Excuse me, I don't look like Patricia Mok. My mouth is not as big, okay? Look carefully. Don't you think I look like Zoe Tay? You do look a bit like her. I told you! So, how? I didn't bring enough money today. Can I go home and think about it? What a waste of time! Come back when you have thought about it. Thank you both so much. Oh, my goodness! She wants to be a model with such looks? She even brought her holiday photos! That's right! But honestly, you really do look like Patricia Mok in this photo. BRAND NEW DAVID GAN Hi! Can I help you? Are you hiring? I'm a shampoo girl. I'm sorry, we're not looking for shampoo girls at the moment. Is David Gan in? David. He's now in Cannes with Ziyi Zhang and then he will go to Beijing with Li Gong... I mean, Gong Li. Excuse me, would you like to get a haircut? How much is the cheapest haircut here? Our junior stylist starts at $120. Thank you. You're welcome! Hi, David! David Gan, you're my idol. Look, I brought your... Hi. This David's got hair? Do you know me? I'm so sorry, David. She's just a shampoo girl, and she's looking for a job. Sorry! I thought you were David Gan. No. It's okay. So, are you going to hire her? No. That's a pity. Such good skin, good figure. Hey, maybe you can come and work for me? We need new girls. The thing to remember about Pure Beauty is that the secret to perfect skin can be found in nature's vast bounty of ingredients. Ingredients! They're raw material. Yes. If you don't understand anything, just read the brochure, okay? If you have any questions, you can consult Earness and Vaness from DHC, okay? Hey, please help her with the English-speaking customers, and she can help you with the Chinese-speaking ones, especially the ones from China and Malaysia. They are very helpful, okay? Hello, Vaness. Hello, Earness. My name is Zann. PLEASE TURN THE VOLUME DOWN AFTER 11 PM Is there anyone sitting here? Come sit down. The chicken rice and noodles here are not bad, or you want some buns? Miss, are you alone? Watching TV? I've seen this show. Very tragic. The guy doesn't even love the girl, but the girl is still very devoted. I can't stand him! - These type of guys... - I want to go to the toilet! You want to go to the toilet now? I want to go to the toilet! I told you to go at the shopping center. Why didn't you say then? I want to go to the toilet! The toilet here is very dirty. I want to go to the toilet! You will slip and fall if you step on some shit! I want to go to the toilet! Stop kicking me! I want to go to the toilet! Stop shouting at me! I want to go to the toilet! Stop kicking me, I'm warning you... I want to go to the toilet! How come there's no Good Morning Singapore on the TV today? I don't know. Uncle, today's Sunday. There's no Good Morning Singapore. That's only from Mondays to Fridays. Weekends are reserved for kids' programs. Right! I forgot about that! - Thanks! - You're welcome. Kopi O, no sugar. Kopi O, no sugar! Singaporeans are so kind, hiring the deaf-mute to be coffee boys. - Thank you! - You're welcome! You are not a deaf-mute? No. Bye! Alpha-arbutin, technologically advanced brightener, used to reduce visible discoloration on the skin caused by sun and age, and to promote a more radiant skin tone. Used in our whitening range, Camu Camu! Very good! Next! Acerola. The dark circle around your nipple. You're wrong! That's areola. I said acerola, stupid! That's what I meant, stupid! I was just kidding. Acerola. Caribbean berry. One of the world's richest natural sources of vitamin C that helps brighten the uneven skin tone. All right, smarty pants! Vaness... I got big ones, you know? Big what? Areolas! How big? No! Yes! No! Yes! You don't believe me? I show you? Come, let's go to the toilet. Okay! - Hello. - Yes. Can I help you? Yes. I'm actually looking for whitening products. Why? Is it that Indians cannot use whitening products? Can! Can you speak Mandarin? I do not speak Mandarin! You are a consultant. You must be able to speak English. It's okay. Do you sell whitening product? Whitening. Black to white. Whitening? Yeah, that's what I've been saying! - Camu Camu! - No! Kumar! No, Camu Camu! Brand name, Camu. Camu. Camu Camu. This one? - Does it help? - I don't know. You work here and you don't know? I am not DHC. I am Pure Beauty. You are pure beauty? - Pure Beauty, I show you. - Oh, product. Look, Earness, that Malaysian girl is trying to take away our customer! Do something! All these foreigners. Sorry, miss, we were just in the toilet. To powder our noses. Oh, my God, it's Kumar! Kumar, my sister Barbarella and I just love you! You are our God! Goddess! In real life, you look so much slimmer. Because on TV, you are so much bigger! You know, you are like very big! The camera is so cruel to you TV stars! Yes, actually, I have lost weight. What you were watching on TV is the repeat telecast of Oh, Carol, which was ten years ago. Yeah! Sure! Sorry. My friend is not a Singaporean. Yes, fresh off the boat, ma'am! So, Kumar, how can we help you today? Although, you don't look like you need any help at all. I'm here to actually buy some whitening products. Sure! You have made the right decision! Welcome to DHC! You have a nice day, sir. You have a nice day, too. Thank you very much. Thank you, Kumar! And remember to introduce DHC to all your actor and actress friends, like Norleena Salim. Yes, I will, because Norleena Salim needs a lot of tightening products. But you are my favorite actress, Kumar. I love you more than even Leticia Bongnino! Who is Bongnino? Hello, Kumar. My name is Zann. I'm also an actress. I know you are a famous actor. Can you introduce me to the TV station? This is my telephone number. You know, I'm not with any TV station. But let me tell you, I have an agent friend who likes to handle artistes, just like you, who sound very funny. - Please call. - Thank you! You're most welcome. Bye! Did he say agent or lawyer? "Samuel Seow." Sounds fake! Bet it's only a prop! Take it back! Hi! Can I help you? Yes. I called just now. I have an appointment with... - With Mr. Seow? - Mr. Seow! Go straight, turn right, to the last room. - Thank you! - Welcome! Mr. Seow, your client is here. Come in. Hello. Hi! You look so much younger than I thought you would. Please have a seat! So, have you thought about this carefully? Sorry, can you speak Mandarin? Chinese ed? Sorry, from your information, I couldn't tell you were Chinese-educated. So, have you thought about this carefully? Well, I'm not getting any younger. I thought if I don't give it a try now, I might regret it in the future. This is such an important matter. How can you just "give it a try"? It's obvious that you haven't given enough thought to it. I suggest you go home and give it serious consideration before coming back to me. I've thought about this very carefully. I've loved your local productions since I was little, like Golden Pillow, The Morning Express, The Unbeatables, The Unbeatables II and The Unbeatables III. I love these shows! I know every line and I can act as every character! Recently, there was a re-run of the character Bobo and that Aiyoyo! I can do them all! Mr. Seow, these are my photographs. Please have a look. If you are willing to give me a chance, I will work very hard and not let you down. You're not here to settle your divorce? Divorce? I'm not even married yet. Sorry, Mr. Seow, your real client is here. I think that girl is here to audition to be your artiste. Can you please get the client to wait in the conference room for a while? What is it that you do? In my hometown, I sell televisions. In Singapore, I am Pure Beauty. I'm a beauty consultant at Watsons. I can see your passion, but I can't see your X factor. We are running an artiste management company, not an extras agency. I can't just sign on anyone who walks in here. I'll tell you honestly, your looks are run of the mill. Besides, your Malaysian accent is so thick. For you to make it in our local entertainment industry, it would be an impossible task. I think you'd better go back to Malaysia and sell televisions. Thank you. Pure Beauty super white... Pure Beauty super brightening series combines the latest whitening technology, including the advanced AWC... I've already paid for my coffee. Are you going to act in a commercial? I'm a Pure Beauty consultant. Wow! Your jade is very beautiful! My grandmother gave this to me. It's an antique. My drama's starting soon. The roads are so quiet! Three cups of coffee! Everyone is still away on holiday. What are they watching? Drama series? It's Saturday. We should be watching football! Uncle, pass me the remote control! Let's watch football, not this! Thank you! This is more exciting! This must be rigged! It's a goal! Did you bet? Yes, I did! The police cars are here! Grandma! Mom? Grandma? Mom? Grandma? Finally back? What happened? The doctor said fluid seeped into Grandma's lungs. She was critically ill and was in the hospital for a few days. Then one day... she gave up. I think Grandma didn't want to waste our money. Before she passed away, she reminded us to put her altar in your room, to protect you. Mom gambles all day now. She hardly ever opens her stall. It's all your fault! Left without a word! Couldn't find you anywhere! Where did you run off to? Do you know how much Grandma loved you? Ah Kiao Sis! You're back. I missed you so much. Wow, Fatty, haven't seen you in a while. You seem to have gained weight again. Ah Kiao Sis, your grandma said you went to Singapore to become a star. No. Your grandma said you would become very famous because she gave you her "longevity." Your whole family will then be able to move to Singapore. Your mom wouldn't have to be a hawker, and your brother wouldn't have to sell DVDs anymore. Ah Kiao Sis, have you become a superstar? I wouldn't know because Mommy won't let me watch TV. Not at all. I'm thinking of coming back to sell televisions. I wonder if the boss has found anyone. Your ambition is to be on television, not sell televisions! Fatty, you wouldn't understand. When you grow up, you will realize that dreams are what you wake up from. But, Ah Kiao Sis, you said it yourself! Where there's a will, there's a way. Look at me, I don't even eat potato chips anymore. When I'm hungry, I just eat broccoli. What's more, my mommy said that if I lose weight, she will let me take ballet lessons! But you said that the black swine danced to her death on stage. Yes, but she died a very successful ballet star. Everybody dies one day. Isn't it better to die already famous? You seem to have become smarter now that you no longer eat potato chips. Not at all. It's actually your grandma who told me all this. Ah Kiao Sis, don't you forget that sissy. David Gan? No! Billy Elliot, silly! Hey, I've seen Thomas Ong before! I've also seen him before. He's been around for almost 20 years. How come he never ages? His acting is not bad, eh? He's all right! - Kopi O... - No sugar. I just made it. Thank you. Hey! It's for you. It's free. Thank you. Bye. Oh, my God. Vaness, look! This man is so rich! Wow! 16 wives and 40 children! I can't believe it! Zoe Tay and Fann Wong are acting in a new show together. But they are enemies, right? Please, it's been so long already. They're no longer enemies. Look, Christopher Lee is also in the show. Then that Zoe Tay can ask them to have babies again. Wow! You're from the Philippines. You know about this, too? Correct! This auntie never gives up. - No! - Yes! - No! - Yes! I don't believe you! Show me. Come. Let's go to the toilet! One, two, one, two. Lose weight. Excuse me, is this where I audition to join the TV station? Go there to take your application form! The agencies here are so small. In Petaling Jaya, our agency is two storeys high. Next time, will you take me along? Hey, I've done car shows before, you know? Why do I have to wait that long? I still have a commercial to shoot later. Hello, my name is Zann. I've come to Singapore for over a month already. I'm from Yong Peng. Where are you from? Serangoon Gardens. There's such a place in Malaysia? You are also from Malaysia? I'm from Yong Peng. Can you speak Mandarin? My Mandarin is awesome. When I dance, I'm as lithe as a swallow! Are you free tomorrow? Tomorrow? Should be fine. Okay, half day tomorrow, from 7:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. Okay? $25, half-day. Report at E5 at 6:00... No, 7:00 a.m. Your local TV station is called E5? E5 is the makeup unit. If there's nothing else, sign here. What will I be acting as? You will be a... Here. Nurse. Nurse. Will I be acting as a kind or vicious nurse? Will I be dispensing medicine or giving injections? Am I a happy or depressed nurse? You're not open yet? So early today? I'm going to be an actress today. Let me go boil some water. Kopi O, no sugar. Hey, maybe not today. I'm afraid I'll be late. Gotta go! Bye. Hello! This is a TV station. Where are you going? I'm here to act, as a nurse. You're an extra? You go there, radio gate. Not radio, TV. I know. But you cannot come here. You must go there, radio gate. Not radio, TV! I'm acting as a nurse! I know! You go there, E5! - Not here. - E5. That side. - Not there? - No, there. Hey, girl! Show me your pass. I'm here to act. I'm an extra. Extra. What is your name? Zann Lee. Zann Lee? - Lee Kar Kiao. - Lee Kar Ki. Kiao. Lee Kar Kiao. - Kiao. - Lee Kar Kiao. No such name! I'm sure there is. I'm acting. I'm an extra. Swee Yong. I'm from Auntie Swee Yong Company. Swee Yong. Okay. You show me your identification card. -IC -IC? No. Not this one. Real identification card. I can't bring the original one out. I might lose it. That's why I had it photocopied. I'm late already. I'm an extra. I'm late already. Do you think my job is very easy? Even Zoe Tay needs a pass to enter... - You! Are you Lee Kar Kiao? - I'm Zann Lee. - You! Do you know you are late? - I know. I was here early but this security guard wouldn't let me in. He kept insisting on seeing my identification card. Sorry. This is one of my people. Go and do your make-up. Go! Where's the makeup unit? You don't even know where the makeup unit is? Turn left and go straight! Sorry. I have the identification card. What a good life you have now. You've got your husband taking care of you and your kid is so cute. You can come and act when you feel like it. Unlike some of our female artistes here, after acting for so long, they still get shouted at by the directors. I heard you just opened a new cake shop, Twelve Cupcakes. You're so capable. And you thought beauty queens are only capable of looking good on stage. We're capable in the kitchen, too! You're a beauty queen? Miss Singapore 2001. Right. I'm so sorry. I should watch the news more often. Sorry. What role are you playing? Nurse. I must have offended someone lately. They keep casting me as an auntie. How? Did you pass? Miss Grouchy plays a sweet girl and I'm playing Miss Grouchy's grouchy sister-in-law. They passed Miss Grouchy's sweet girl look but not my grouchy sister-in-law look! No worries. I'll touch up your makeup. Get up. Diva Koh Bee Cheng is waiting. Who's that? Is she our new artiste? No way. She's just an extra. Sister, don't sabotage me. Extras nowadays have blogs and Twitter accounts. They will call me a shrew if I'm not careful. Stop laughing. Quick. Okay. Sister, you spent such a long time touching up. Is there a difference? Check out the lips, they are crimson. I need to go on a course. Get lost. Cynthia Koh, are you done? The executive producer is waiting for you. Who are you to call me Cynthia Koh? Even Dai Yangtian calls me Big Sister Koh, okay? - Sister, I'm off. - Bye. Hey, come here. Done. I'm playing a nurse in a hospital, not a nurse in an adult film. Hey, take off your mask. You are acting as a cancer patient and you're wearing lipstick? Take it off! Quick! Wait! All right. Smile. Wait! What is that? Have you ever seen cops wearing diamond studs? Take it off. Hey, take off your hair clip. Hey! Have you seen enough? Don't block the path. Go over there. Wait. Don't spoil Swee Yong's reputation. Guys, remember to turn off your mobile phones. The assistant producer for this drama is very fierce. Karen, they got you to act as a man again? Susan, I haven't seen you since Golden Pillow. Where did you disappear to? Did Yiliang cast you in his movie? He contacted me directly. Hey, first time? You didn't bring anything to pass the time? I only took a half-day leave. And it's almost 1:00 p.m. There's always a long waiting time. That's why they book us the whole day. You have lines? "Sir, please don't be like this." Wow, not bad. I didn't have any lines on my first day. When the bomb landed, we had to jump like this. And after that, we still had to shake like this. You think that's easy? Haven't you ever acted being shot? Let me demonstrate for you. Hang on, it's a little bit painful. One shot. Two shots. Machine gun shots! Are you a full-time actress? Of course not. There's so little money in this. I help my mother sell laksa. But I've been acting a long time. The APs look for me directly, and I'm not from any agency. The APs all know me very well. You just have to say "Angie" and all the APs know. So, besides playing dead, what else have you acted as? Everything. Let me sit down first. I've acted as doctors, nurses, bar girls, reporters, office girls. I've acted in many office serials. Have you seen New Generation? I was the one who got married. Li Nanxing was my colleague and my hair was a nice bob. Maybe I have a different look now, you don't recognize me. Before that, I was in a series with Terence Cao. Remember? Terence said he was getting married? Do you know why he didn't in the end? It was because of this series. No, it wasn't me. I'm not his type. He was with... Nurse B? It's my turn. Next time, remind me to tell you who it was, okay? I will also tell you which artiste Ping Hui was going out with before. Next time, better demonstrate with less strength. - Romeo Tan, right? - Yes. - First drama? - Yeah. Okay, whatever I do later, you just follow and support, okay? Okay, sure. I've got a question. We are filming a Mandarin serial, right? Yeah, I'm bilingual, effectively. I can sing and dance, too! You, Starz Search. I, Singapore Idol. Okay. You, what number? What shade number? Am I too fair? I better go touch up! Later, after Nat says his lines, I will cue you. Then you will stand here and say your line, okay? You will kill me? "Cue" means prompting you to come in. You don't even know "cue"? Swee Yong said you were a Grade B extra. Looks like you are not even a Grade D. You're so going to get me into trouble. The director is going to kill me. Yes, director! Romeo Tan has gone to touch up again! I'm done. All right, he's back. Okay, everybody, stand by. Our Hospital scene 50, take one! Camera rolling and action! Grandma! It's all my fault, Grandma! You still have the nerve to be here? Where were you all this time? You are worse than a beast! Grandma... Grandma, please forgive me. Grandma, please forgive me! Sir, please don't be like this. I swear I'll always come and visit you. Grandma... Grandma, please don't die. Grandma, please don't die! Do you remember? When I was little, you doted on me the most. Doted, my foot. Grandma loves you so much. When she needed you the most, where were you? Haven't you said enough? No. I've been taking care of Grandma all this time. What about you? What kind of a grandson are you? I was busy. I had work to do! You have work? Me, too! Grandma! Are you okay? Cam one, go back to the nurse. Yes! Nurse. Correct, that's her! Okay. Give me a close-up. Zoom in, slowly zoom in. A little bit more. Cut! Okay! Lovely! Did you see that? Oh, my God! Did you see that? Yes, I saw that. Some extras really know how to steal the scene. How dare she even memorize my lines? That's right! Can't stand it. If she's really that good, why doesn't she join Starz Search? Or Singapore Idol. Singapore Idol. Thank you! Wow! Good take! Good take! Hey! Hello! I'm the director of this drama. Don't be scared, you did great. Did you see that? Your acting, your feeling, it was superb. Just like a lead actress! You must have majored in Drama or done some theatre. I sell televisions in Yong Peng. Well, the more TV you watch, the better your acting gets! Anyway, I'm starting a new drama series. We're looking for a female lead and I think you are who we are looking for. Great. If you're interested, just give me a call. I'm Director Boris. Remember, you must call me. You're the one. Let's watch the playback! What about you? What kind of a grandson are you? - I was busy, I had work to do! - You have work? Me, too! Grandma! Grandma, are you okay? - Grandma! - Grandma! - Grandma! - Grandma! Wow! She got a close-up on her first day? I thought you were sick. You still managed to run so fast? And for a sick person, you really wear a lot of makeup. I hate it when people lie to me. Luckily, Earness and Vaness told me about your working attitude. They said you've been passing your number to customers and asking them to give you jobs, right? Well, if you don't appreciate this job that I gave you, you don't have to come in anymore. Sorry. Excuse me, do you still have any cakes? Do you want a whole cake? They are all sold out. Well, except for one. They were supposed to collect it today, but they called to say it's not needed anymore. But there are already some words on the cake. Do you still want it? Wait here. From a birthday celebration to a funeral, that's life. What's your name? My name's Christopher. Ah Seng, two Teh O! Ah Seng is just my nickname. For you. It's free. Bye. How many times do I have to tell you? My new name is Christopher! HAPPY BIRTHDAY GRANDMA! HERE'S WISHING YOU HAPPINESS AND LONGEVITY Mom. - Hey! - Finally back? Good to have you back. Look what I bought for you guys. Don't eat this anymore. It's your favorite, roast duck. - Roast duck! - And all these goodies from Watsons. This is a knee support. Your knees are weak. Not those, knees! - Right here! - And this is for men, SPF15. Not bad, for the face. This face mask is suitable for both men and women. This is good, it's DHC! What C? Wow! Bird's Nest! Fantastic! Thank you, Grandma. Mom, it's starting soon! Okay. Ah Leng! Uncle Satay, you're here. Uncle Satay is here to watch you appear on TV. Auntie Otah, come! Quick! Auntie Otah is here to support you. There are seats over there. Great. Everyone's here. Starting soon. Plenty of space over there. Make yourself comfortable. They are all here to support you. I'm going to appear soon. I'm the nurse. Call yourself a man? You're worse than a beast! Grandma, please forgive me. Sir, please don't be like this! I swear I'll always come and visit you. Grandma, please don't die, Grandma! Grandma, are you all right? Doctor! Show's over! The credits have started. Where was she? Even the voice sounded different. Not even a shadow! Zero! Nothing at all! I knew it was impossible! Should have bet with you! It was just the shoulder, might have been a body double. Extras have body doubles, too? Body double or not, it's time to pay up! Yes! Pay up! Well, you guys saw the shoulder, right? We didn't bet whether we would see the face. Don't cheat! Pay up! We saw the body, didn't we? That's how I bet! You guys got to pay up! No cheating now, we saw the shoulder! I gave birth to Ah Kiao! I would know her shoulder! Is this Director Boris? How are you? I'm Zann. Zann, not Fann. Zann! No, I acted in your Our Hospital. I played the nurse. Yes, the nurse. You gave me a close-up, remember? And you said you have a lead role for me. Hello? Hello? Grandma, I will redeem it. What kind of joke is this? This is not even worth a dollar. What a waste of my time! What's going on? I want to watch Thomas Ong! That's my story. Sometimes, I really feel like giving up. Go back to my hometown to sell televisions, or help my brother sell DVDs. But whenever I think of my grandma, I know in my heart that she'd want me to stay. Do you want another cup? I'll go make it. No, thanks. I think I'd better go. I'm afraid the landlord will lock the door. Don't you have the key? He doesn't let me have it. He's afraid that I'll lose it. But it's okay, the rent is cheap. Anyway, I've got nowhere to go at night. The only thing I don't like is that there's no TV at his place. No wonder you're always here the whole day, to watch TV and you only order one cup of coffee. The boss says if everyone was like you, we'd close down in no time. Next time I'll order two cups? I'm only joking with you. Who are you? I'm Christopher. Do you have amnesia? No, what I meant was, your accent is obviously Taiwanese. Why would you be working here as a coffee boy? Can't Taiwanese be coffee boys? No, they can only be stars, singers and hosts! Hey, I love watching that program 100% Entertainment. I love that, too. I especially love Show Lo. I think he's very handsome. I think so, too. I'm just like you, crossing the ocean to be here. I took the bus, but I guess it's considered crossing the ocean, too, since I crossed the causeway. Right. But the difference is you're chasing your dreams. I'm chasing after my love. So, have you gotten your love? Is she Singaporean? Is it a guy or a girl? Guess. You said you liked Show Lo, so it must be a guy. Bingo! - So, do I get a free cup of coffee? - No. She went to school in Taiwan. We were very much in love. So when she came back to Singapore, I decided to give up everything and follow her here. But her dad was against us being together. He's a coffee tycoon, and he feels I'm not worthy of his daughter. Your story is just like my grandma's. Your grandma fell in love with a coffee tycoon's daughter, too? Of course not. What I meant was your story's as dramatic as my grandma's. My grandma's ex-boyfriend was a superstar. But her mother was also against them being together because she said that all actors are heartless. Hey, how come you never mention your dad? Well, my mom said he left one day to look for a job in Singapore and never came back. My mom also said, even though he's not an actor, he's equally heartless. Actually, she said, all men are heartless. What a sweeping statement. How can your mom generalize like that? Do you have a boyfriend? Let me tell you a secret. I've never had a boyfriend in my life. Liar! It's true. And you haven't even told me. Told you what? What you're doing here making coffee. Don't tell me your girlfriend's daddy owns this coffee shop. Of course not. I told myself that I would one day take over his coffee empire. I'm going to be a coffee king. I must know everything about coffee. That's why I'm starting from the bottom. I told myself, one day, I will make the world's best cup of coffee. I think you would probably have to make a million cups. Of course. Where there's a will, there's a way. Nobody becomes already famous overnight. It takes determination and perseverance to even become almost famous. Don't you agree? Here's your Gong Cha, "Already Famous!" Really? I've never seen anyone who loves watching movies as much as you do. Quick, go before the manager comes back. Thank you. Uncle, it's your favorite bubble tea. It's called "Already Famous." It's got white pearls. That's great. Thank you. You're giving me a gold class seat today? Sure. Nobody watches this kind of movie anyway. Go in quickly. Zann! Zann! Zann! Ah Kiao! - Hello. - Hello. Watching the movie all by yourself? You, too? - Today's the last screening. - Today's the last screening. You haven't come to the coffee shop in a long time. I've been quite busy lately. What about later? I'll buy you dinner. I can't, I'm still working. I'm selling bubble tea, over there. I sneaked out to watch this movie. What time are you working till? Should be quite late. We have to wait for the midnight show to end. What about tomorrow night? I'm filming tomorrow night. We are shooting the Singapore version of Night Market Life. Since it's "night" market life, we can only film at night, so we'll probably film till quite late. Don't you have to work at the coffee shop tomorrow? Yes. In that case, why don't you come to the coffee shop after your filming tomorrow? I'll treat you to supper. All right then. I'll make a move first. Do you want "Already Famous"? It's free. What's that? Bubble tea. No, thanks. All right then. - Bye. - Bye. Hot! I borrowed this dress from the wardrobe department. I acted as a bar girl today. Bar girls these days are so fashionable. Wow, this is like a film set. Have a seat. What a spread! I bought it from the coffee shop across the street. We don't sell Western food here. Cheers! Cheers! Can I eat now? I'm starving. Aren't you going to eat? So... Are you still... Do you still... How did you know what I was going to ask? I forgot to mention it the other day. My ex-girlfriend is already married. Really? So what are you doing still working in this coffee shop? I might not be chasing love, but I'm still chasing my dreams. I've never given up on making the world's best cup of coffee. We can't be "hot for three minutes" towards any work, and that includes coffee making. Coffee can't be hot for just three minutes. At least ten minutes, right? I have something for you. BLESSINGS I can't accept this. Why not? This can't replace your grandmother's "longevity," but what's the use of having a long life with no blessings? Hey, maybe these "blessings" will make it easier for you to pursue your dreams. More luck, less hardship. I just hope you will be able to achieve your dreams sooner. I better put it on now then. I want to achieve my dreams sooner. How do I look? It matches your dress. I spent a long time looking for it. The boss said it's an antique, too. This is an antique, too? Yes. The longer you wear it, the greener it gets. - Really? - Yes. My face's going to turn green then. You won't, you look great. Hello? Let me tell you, I was acting with Edmund in a restaurant that day. There were two extras who just kept on eating from the buffet. The director was so angry. Let me ask you, if there was fish and some slices of cucumber on a platter, - what would you eat? - Cucumber. Why? - Cucumber is cheaper? - No. If you were to eat the fish, there would be no continuity. Do you know continuity? I doubt you do. And we were already overrunning. The director and the AP were so stressed. So when Ah Gek arrived, we had to go out and buy another fish. Is that professional of an extra? Is it? Who is Ah Gek? Ah Gek is Zoe Tay. You didn't know that? The executive producer is here! No more talking! - EP. - Hello, EP. You're Zann, right? Do you recognize me? I remember you. I told you to call me the other time. Why didn't you? What a shame. The lead role went to another actress. Hello, EP. I'm Angie. You remember me? I acted in your The Price Of Peace. My husband was tortured to death by the Japanese. Angie. The one who died a tragic death. You've acted for a very long time. I joined this industry the same time as Terence. Same time as Terence? You've been in this line for a very long time indeed. I've just the show for you. What show? I've acted in countless drama serials. The APs always contact me directly. It's not a drama serial. It's a variety program. It's a national talent search. It's going to be phenomenal. You guys will become famous. Starz Search. I've taken part five times, but last year, they said I was over the age limit. It's not Starz Search. Anyway, just go to the variety department tomorrow to audition. Tell them that it was Boris who recommended you. Your chances will be higher. Who knows? You might be the stars of tomorrow. You are not lying to me again, are you? Why should I lie to you? Will I win the lottery if I do? Anyway, when you become famous, you will thank me for it. Here's the form. Next scene! Ping Hui, what happened to your hair? There's no continuity. KING OF THE EXTRAS Good morning! I'm sure you recognize the famous Best Actress, Cynthia Koh. And he is Bryan Wong, winner of the Best Host Award. And also the Best Infotainment Host Award. Twice. My name is Lim Poh Huat. I'm 47 years old. CYNTHIA KOH - BRYAN WONG Many people think it's easy being an extra, but that's just a misconception. Not only do extras need to support the scene, they can't steal the limelight from the lead actors. That's right. But for some lead actors, it's not difficult to steal their limelight. Okay, let me give you the scenario. You're standing by the road and you just witnessed a car accident. There's a body on the road. What's your reaction? You gotta think. Ready? Action! Action! Someone is dead. You guys go away, I need to save him. Hi, Sis Cynthia! Hi, Bro Bryan! She's calling the police. Who are you actually calling? You only need to dial three digits to call the police. Why are you pressing so many buttons? I'm not calling the police. I'm buying lottery tickets. I'm keying in the different permutations. My name is Lee Kar Kiao, Zann. I'm from Yong Peng, Malaysia. Three, two, one, action! That's not bad. I sense some emotions. Could you elaborate on what was going through your mind just now? I might not know the deceased, but I can imagine... when he was crossing the road, he was probably rushing home for dinner. But now that he is gone, he will never have to chance to go home and have dinner with his family ever again. I felt that, did you? Okay, you are... - Very good. - Very good. Thank you. TOP 16 FINALISTS TOP 8 FINALISTS "Grandmother, please don't blame Ah Tao. It wasn't her who stole it." KING OF THE EXTRAS Stole it. Want some coffee? Stole it. Stole it. Please don't blame Ah Tao. It wasn't her who stole it. That's so exaggerated! Can you lower the volume? I'm memorizing the lines for the competition. But this is your favorite show. But tomorrow's the finals. It wasn't easy for me to get this far. I have to keep practicing until it's perfect. There has to be no cuts and no "no goods." Most importantly, I have to practice until my Malaysian accent is gone. Stole it, not stole it. Stole... But I love your Malaysian accent. Nothing. It's really loud. Why don't you go watch over there? It's distracting. - I'll go make coffee. - "She stole it. You can blame me for it! Grandmother, please don't blame Ah Tao. It wasn't her who stole it." Good evening, everyone. I'm Lee Teng. Hello! I'm Pornsak. Welcome to King of the Extras. Our finalists have been chosen from thousands of contestants for the chance to stand on this stage tonight. Let's welcome them! Another round of applause! Hey, look! It's that village girl! She's in the finals! She's looking good! Must be Pure Beauty! Angie, what's been your most challenging role? My most challenging role was a bomb blast victim. Have you ever acted being killed by a bomb? - No. - What about you? - No. - Never, right? Let me demonstrate for you. Hold the mic for me. And we still have to shake like this. Let's welcome the next finalist, Sly! Sylvester Sim! Let me tell you... What a poser. Sly's really something. He was first runner-up in Singapore Idol 2004. He was a household name. That's right. He was really popular. - Yes. - So what's he doing here today? Hey! Bro David? If you were to win today, what kind of sacrifices would you make for your career? Plastic surgery. In fact, I've already done it. Because I believe I have to present my best side to the audience, if being on stage is the path that I've chosen. Fake beauty is still beauty. Very good. That's the right attitude. You were once already famous. I believe you will become even more famous. Let's welcome Zann on stage for the interview. She's the hot favorite tonight. All right, Auntie Kiasu! If you have a choice, which local artiste would you choose to act with? If I have a choice, I will choose to work with a local artiste from Malaysia. Like Christopher Lee, Chen Hanwei, Zhang Yaodong, Apple Hong, Jesseca Liu and... I think we know what you are trying to say, but why? If I were to act with them, there would be a sense of familiarity. I would be more at ease. They say when one's comfortable, one's acting will be more natural. But most importantly, they wouldn't laugh at my Malaysian accent. Well done! What a good answer. How eloquent. If I had known sooner, I wouldn't have cast you as a nurse. I would have sent you directly to Jack Neo. Everybody knows that an extra has to take on many roles. Even acting as a corpse needs to be realistic. What's the most important thing when acting as a dead person? You can't breathe. If you have a heaving chest, you'll give the game away. Hey, Singapore Idol, don't lose face! His challenge is, hold your breath for 30 seconds! Sly, we used to go fishing for mudfish when we were young. Fish, my foot. Sly was so close to you. Where were you when he needed you the most? Sly? Are you all right? Sly, wake up! That was less than five seconds. What were you thinking? I just had a nose job. Look, my nostrils are so small. How to hold my breath? Boy, that was quick. Let's welcome our next finalist, Zann. Zann, do you still remember? When we were little, we used to climb trees together. Climb, my foot. Zann was so good to you. Where were you when she needed you the most? It's getting exciting. Can Zann beat Sly's record? Not even ten seconds and she's up? What a pity. It was less than ten seconds. Must be nerves. What a shame. There are so many people supporting her tonight. She's the hot favorite after all. Is it really that difficult to hold one's breath? Let's find out from our next finalist, Angie! Angie, do you remember? When we were little, we used to fly kites together. Fly, my foot. Angie was so good to you. Where were you when she needed you the most? Haven't you said enough? Angie? Are you all right? Angie! Quick, call the doctor! - Look at her great performance. - She's not even moving a fingernail. Counting down! Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one! Congratulations! You did it! Well done! I held my breath for so long, I thought I was really going to die. Angie is really a pro at acting. No wonder she is the master of extras. Absolutely. She must have played a corpse many times in her acting career. Of course. Right now, Angie is leading. But can Zann catch up in the last round? We'll find out after the break! Zann! I was so nervous! My face was itching. I was dying to scratch it. Luckily, I resisted. Are you okay? Everyone's bound to be nervous, but I told myself, winning this competition would be like winning the lottery. I've already won the consolation prize. So don't worry so much, okay? I need to go touch up my hair. Lying down for so long messed it up a little. Angie, can you please lend me your phone? It's in my bag. Help yourself, okay? Hey, I heard that finalist is your girlfriend. So lucky. She's pretty. Stop teasing me, you guys. Hello? It's me. Zann, how come you can use the phone? You were great! Everyone here says you look beautiful! Hello? What's wrong? Are you okay? Is it nerves? Just relax. I'm sure to lose. Isn't there a final round? It's useless. I won't win. The game's not over yet and you're already giving up? That's not the Zann I know. I'm not even Zann. I'm just Ah Kiao from Yong Peng. I only know how to sell televisions. I don't know how to be on television. Don't put yourself under so much pressure. It's only a competition. You don't understand. This isn't just a competition. If I lose, I will have nothing left. I will have to go back to selling televisions. Mom will be devastated, and even lose money. My brother will be disappointed... and the whole village will laugh at me. There's no shame in losing. At least you did your best. Everybody knows that, especially me. Losing this competition doesn't mean that you will lose at everything else. How many people can be like you? You're Ah Kiao from Yong Peng, yet you managed to be on national TV. Not everyone can make it on his or her first shot. And not everyone can last till the end. To me, you've already won. If they don't give you the female lead, I will. If you don't mind... you can be the leading lady in my life. You can always "no good" and try again... but no one will ever shout "cut." Welcome back to King of Extras. It's our final round. That's right, in this critical round, we are going to test the finalists' crying skills. The one who can shed a tear within a minute will be our winner. Remember, the winner gets a ten-year, full-time artiste contract with the TV station. A ten-year contract with the TV station? The mere thought of it makes me want to weep. Tears of joy of course. Yes, of course. Let's welcome our first finalist, Angie. Angie, even though you're leading, if you don't cry on cue and Zann does, Zann will be the winner. But if you do, the ten-year contract will be yours. But if both you and Zann can't cry, you're still our winner. Understand? You got it? Anyway, just try to cry. That means I've already won at least the second prize. Glad that you finally got it. If you're ready, we're going to start timing. Get set, go! - Time's up! - Not a single tear. But no worries. Now's really the exciting time. If Zann cries on cue, she'll be our champion. But if Zann doesn't cry, Angie will be our champion tonight. Hey, Zann. We heard from the drama producers you can turn it on like a tap. I'm just okay. But now you have to cry under a lot of pressure. You think you can do it? I think she's ready. - You have one minute. Go. - You go, girl. Grandma, this is David Gan. He's a hair stylist for many celebrities in Singapore. When you're young, do what your heart desires. Don't think so much. What's the use of having a long life if you don't get to do what you love? Why is she smiling? Hey, Zann, we need you to cry. Shed tears! Weep! Cry, not smile! If you don't cry, I'm going to cry soon. What now? Cry, don't smile! Ah Kiao Sis, cry! Cry! Cry! Cry! Cry! Cry! To me, you've already won. If they don't give you the female lead, I will. If you don't mind... you can be the leading lady in my life. You can always "no good" and try again... but no one will ever shout "cut." She did it! Congratulations, Zann! You're the inaugural winner of King of Extras. She cried! She just won a ten-year contract with the TV station! It's great to have you joining us! Once again, we want to congratulate Zann for being the champion of King of Extras! She's awesome! We would like to invite David to crown our new winner. and to hand her the trophy. Don't forget she also gets the coveted ten-year contract with the TV station. It makes me want to cry, too! What a touching moment! What a joyous occasion! Welcome to our big, happy family! Congratulations, once again! Lee Kar Kiao! Stop watching television! Two cups of Kopi, two cups of tea! Crying again? Come to Mommy. She's looking for you. Daddy's naughty, let's beat him. Don't cry. BOOMING BUSINESS We can't be "hot for three minutes" towards any work, and that includes coffee making. Three minutes... Screwed! Jammed. ...and that includes coffee making. Come on. How can we as humans... Towards work... Towards what? Coffee can't be hot for just three minutes. At least ten minutes, right? Coffee... Why not? Although this can't replace your grandmother's... From here, read it again. Well... I've loved your local productions since I was little, like Golden Pillow, Little Flying Fish and... Golden Pillow, The Spring of Holland, The Morning Express, and The Unbeatables, The Unbeatables II... I feel dizzy. And I liked watching The Morning Express, too, because the actor was Chan Hanwei... I love you more than even Leticia Bongnino. Who is Bongnino? I would like to tell you about an artiste who speaks funny, just like you. So, please call him. You think that's easy? Haven't you ever acted being shot? No, right? Let me demonstrate for you. Hang on. One moment, we need to jump a bit like this. I'm sorry, I cannot... The third contestant is remarkable. He's done Lin Zhiling's with Liu Jialing's and with Gong Li's hairstyle. He's Liang... Liang Chaowei! - Don't stare at me. Eat and say, "Hmm." - Hmm. Eat. Eat more. Smile a bit. A bit more. Okay, good, now to the end, okay? Why not? Although this can't replace your... Why not?
