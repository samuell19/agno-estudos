What is it now? Dad says he can't give me the gallery in Cheongdam-dong. So annoying. So what? I told you not to wear that tie pin! Good morning, boss! Tell them I'd like to invest in those Uzbekistani coal mines. And make sure we get 30% of the shares. We will establish a local corporation so just carry on with the deal. What? About the Jungwon-dong plaza, we've gotten rid of most of the tenants. But the carpenter's shop is still holding out. Department Head Choi. How long have you been in this industry? From liquor distribution, 21 years. Now that it's been a while and you're wearing a necktie, you've lost your touch haven't you? Section Chief Bang! Yes, sir. Gather the men, go to Jungwon-dong, and deal with it. Yes, sir. Is something wrong, sir? Of course not. I'm going to go for a smoke. I told you there were plenty of things to use as weapons, why'd you have to bring all this... We aren't amateurs. Kim Jong Gi? Hands. Kim Jong Gi? This is illegal. I have the right to retain this property. You can discuss your rights with the head boss later. Today, let's just sign and grab a meal. Lease Termination Agreement Nosong Carpentry - I'll count to three. One. Two. Three. Hey! Look who it is. It's Jang Hyung! You love peasant food like stews, what are you doing here? I need to grease my intestines now and then. But, why are you eating by yourself? Where's your wife? Mind your own business, CEO Yang. You should hand the Cheongdo-related matters to me. I've been really working on it for over six months. It wasn't because you didn't scrounge up anything at Oseong Logistics? What? Are you saying you want to get down and dirty, battle it out in this high tech era? Jang Hyung, you went to a top-tier college. Have you always been this stuffy? So what? What do you mean? You smartass. But what to do? Hearing "high tech" come out of your filthy piehole makes the phrase sound so run-down. You little shit. Do you still see me as your ass-kissing minion? You couldn't even wax my shoes properly. Can you handle it? I can't. Who can handle your face? I definitely can't. Let's go get some stew! Yeah, it's me. Will Cheongdo accept it? If we pour our private loans into it and win management rights, then they have no choice. I heard Yang's men are working on Cheongdo. We worked on it first, so he won't be able to take us on so easily. Don't forget. Gangsters have no qualms bringing knives to the neck. It took us eighteen years to get this far. Congratulations, sir. Congratulations? It's too early for that. Where are you going, sir? To receive grace. My my... Aren't you dressed up for mackerel ramen? A young woman ran this shop ten years ago, did the owner change? She's dead, that woman. Kid, have your fill. All right? Check please. Aren't you going to eat? It's doesn't taste the same as before? Just let me pay. You don't like eating alone, huh? Well, at this age, not having anyone to eat ramen with-- What? I'll be right there. - How sad. - How much? Ma'am, I'm really sorry, but I lost my wallet... That's all right, this gentleman will pay for it, go on. What? - Go on. - I'm in a rush right now... - Thank you! Thank you! - Don't worry. See you! Get going! - Hey! Kid! - Take care, kid. Sir, ready to pay? 10,000 won (approx.$9) per dish, total of 50,000 (approx.$45). 10,000 for ramen? But why is it 50,000? That goddamn fat bastard... Someday, I'll give you a nice present. You're a successful man, so you can be generous. Hope Snack I'm never coming back to this shithole. It's me. Did you look into Yang's side? THE DUDE IN ME Where am I? Right, something hit me, and I must have fainted... Kid. What? Kid? You're awake? What's she saying? This lady... What do you mean kid? Don't force yourself to speak, I'll get the doctor. You're up? What? You know me? Are you all right, kid? Who are they calling 'kid'? What the... Why am I lying here? You there. You can't be moving around like this, please return to your room. Your father's on the way, please wait a bit. My father died more than ten years ago... - Dong Hyeon! - There he is. - Dong Hyeon! - Who's that baldy? Son, I thought you'd never wake up! Son? Are you all right? Dong Hyeon... Hold on, Dong Hyeon. What are they... That's a mirror... I don't believe this... Amnesia? Yes, it's a form of retrograde amnesia caused by accidents. Then what about the change in his speech? He speaks completely differently than before. There are some cases of patients with head trauma where they believe they are someone else. In those cases, their behavior and speech changes. It's your dad, don't recognize me? No, I don't! How many times do I have to tell you I'm not your son! What's with this voice? What was his personality like before? Well, he has an appetite, but he's not the kind of kid that would get into fights. - Nice kid? - Yes. A high school student? That's all right, go on. This gentleman will pay for it. What? Could he be that kid... And... Someday, I'll give you a little present. That old granny? What the... That snack shop went out of business long ago! What are you harping on about? I ate ramen here yesterday, how many times do I have to say it?! It was that good? Is that why? Yesterday afternoon around 5 pm, high school student "Kim" attempted to commit suicide by jumping off this plaza building located in Seonggilsam-dong. He fell on a man "Jang" in his 40s, who happened to be passing by. Boss, they say he got into an accident with a high school student and in a coma. Jang Pan Su?! Incredible! Stupid woman... Where the hell did she go? Dammit... My precious necklace... Why did it break... Really... Who are you? Um, I am... I'm Pan Su. Your husband, Jang Pan Su. Something unbelievable happened to me-- Stay back! - I'll explain everything slowly. - Stay back! - Please sit down. - Police! Will you listen to me?! - What are you doing? - Stay back! I'm really Pan Su. I'll prove it, so put that down. If you're Jang Pan Su, then I'm your mom, fatso! How did you know the door passcode? Did you escape from a psych ward? I'll explain everything, so put that down. No way! Stay back! Han Seo Yeon! Listen to me! Hold still! Let me go! This is my home! Don't move! The aforementioned person committed the act of breaking and entering the penthouse... Why did you go to that house? Did you go to steal some food? Listen, young man, what did you say?! Wait! Dong Hyeon! My boy may be a bit chubby, but he's not the type to steal other people's food. He injured his head recently, so he's not himself, so he must've mistaken it for our home, right? Since he's a minor, we'll release him with a warning. It's your last warning. Of course! My apologies! I'll teach him properly! Dong Hyeon, come on. Sorry, officer! Come out, you bastard. This doesn't work. I got it. Huh? Excuse me. Hey, prick! What were you doing to my boss? It's not what you think. Then what? Did CEO Yang send you? You son of a... Wait a minute... You fat... It's you! You fat ass! You crushed my boss with your fat! So savage! Bring my boss back! Wake him up! Look, I understand how you feel. Let go. Let what go, you asshole! What are you doing? This is the ICU! Let's talk later. Hey! Fat ass! If I ever see you again, I'm going to smoke you! Go inside. Alright. I'll thank you for the hospitality. I'll leave when I find a new home. This is your home, Dong Hyeon! Why do you keep saying you're going to leave? You got a job? Huh? I did. I work at a grocery store for the moment. Wait. A man must look tidy. Go ahead and eat, son. All this... by myself? I've only made half of the usual, but I can cook more if you want. You must be mistaken. I don't eat instant or junk food. Give it a try first. These are your favorites. Here, for the sake of my effort. What's wrong? See? You love them. I love that you eat so well, my dear son. So greasy... Get some sleep and we'll go to school tomorrow. School? I have to go and personally see what happened. I can't let this slide. How dare they do this to my son... Basic Carpentry Mr. Vice Principal. Hello. Good to meet you, I'm Jang— I mean Kim Dong Hyeon. Dong Hyeon injured his head... I see. - Please sit down. - Yes, sir. Dong Hyeon, over here. I've been told that he can't remember what happened that day. Couldn't it have been that something happened at school? He's not a boy who'd attempt to commit suicide. He probably had some sort of reason... Are you implying that our students did something to him? Well, who knows. Mr. Kim, I've told the police a few times already, but nothing like that happened. Hey, I'll look into it, so you can go home, mister. What? Vice principal, right? I'm going to go to class starting today. Quiet! Dong Hyeon's memory hasn't fully returned due to the accident, so please help him out until he adjusts. Yes! Go take an empty seat. Do you know how difficult it was while you were away? Alright, open your books. Jae Ik, share your book with Dong Hyeon. Page 111. You may adjust the brightness of the light with the... What's 'adjust' here? Alter or regulate, right? Then the correct answer is D, right? Imagine how hard it was for me. Where's mine? - So cute. - What a cutie. It's Hyeon Jeong. Why aren't you eating? - Too bland? - Maybe it's not good. That looks delicious. It's seasoned properly. Go on and eat it. - Go on, eat. - Eat. Look at her poker face, no reaction at all. Stop it please. - Stop it. - Please. Oops, sorry. My mistake. Hey, children! Be quiet, so I can eat in peace. Then eat, fatso! Why does he suddenly need our permission? He must be starved. Is this really happening? This fucking loser must've lost his mind when he hurt his head. Fucking loser? Should I help you remember? Hey! What's going on there? Those bastards. See me after school. Wow, he really came. - Go easy, Tae Uk. - Don't kill him. Who are you? "Who are you?" Do you really not remember anything? Talking like an shitting old geezer. Hey. But nothing's changed, so listen carefully. You come running to me at every break. Bring a hamburger and strawberry milk with you. Was I your snack delivery boy or something like that? Do we not work well together? Do you need a beating? Then you'll remember! - You bastard! - Sorry. I don't like getting hit. You crazy bastard! Not again! Dammit! Wait! I got a question. Did this Dong Hyeon bloke... did he do anything to offend you? Listen to this crazy bastard. There was no such thing, you fat ass! Which means, to sum it up, - because he's easy? - Yeah. Not just easy, he's too fucking easy! Get it you psycho?! Did you start going to gym? This joke is too much! Kim Dong Hyeon! Are you all right? - Are you all right? - I'm fine. - You bastard! - Hey! Stop! Let me go! Asshole... You saw everything yesterday, didn't you? I didn't see anything... You bastard, you want to die? I'll kill you if you're lying. Hey! This guy's got big balls. Let's strip him and film him, as insurance. That's a good idea. No, please! This isn't right between friends! What is this idiot saying? Strip him. Hold still, Jae Ik. - Here we go. - Wait a minute! - Don't move. - Please don't! Dong Hyeon... Hey, hey... Phone... G-give me that, you fat ass! What? Give it back before I hurt you! Now! Is there something I shouldn't see? Give it to me! Are you all right? Dude! I'll return it tomorrow. What do we do? Tomorrow for sure! This is Kim Dong Hyeon, how about a comment? I... I just have to bring that back, right? Yup. I won't bother Hyeon Jeong again, I promise. But walk all the way down that rail to retrieve her shoe. Then it's mission clear. Hey, what are you doing?! Dong Hyeon, stop it! He's going all out to get your shoe. It's really dangerous! "It's really dangerous!" And I was right below? Did I tell you to delete that video or not? That idiot loser won't do anything. Hey, high school kiddos! You fat ass, give me my phone! Now! That was an interesting video. So what? Are you going to take it to the cops? You gained balls after smashing your head. I'm not a big fan of cops either. I don't like getting involved in other people's business either. Other people's business? I made a copy, as insurance. If you ever get in my line of sight again... You get it, right? You're finally here! Dammit, I almost died waiting! Mrs. Jang! Good evening! CEO Yang? Team Leader Choi, have you been well? Your fly's open, man. Just kidding. What are you trying to do? Yo, bring it! My boys took a lot of photos of you two. So I was going to send them to Chairman Han... Wow this is pretty racy, how could they take pictures of this! You know how much Chairman Han hates affairs and that sort. He's weird in that way, with his strong moral compass. What should I do with this? What do you want? Who ordered you to guard him? You fat ass! Didn't I tell you I'd smoke you if I ever saw you again? Should I get the marinade ready? - Stupid bastard! - Bang Man Cheol! 43 years old. Graduate of Samil Technical High School and Dongbang Community College. Began working for Hanho Group on October 21, 2001. Promoted to section chief in February 2004. Currently single. How did you know? Because I'm Jang Pan Su. Bullshit, my boss is over there. The scar by your eye, was slashed with a broken bottle at 11 p.m., on March 21, 2005. You took the hit for me. You got twenty stitches at Jinseong Hospital, costing me 385,200 won (approx.$340). How did you... I truly don't deserve you. You sure eat a lot. My appetite won't die down. - What is it? - Um... Those eyes... You really are my boss. My apologies. When else would I be able to touch your face? No one ordered you to, so why were you guarding me in the hospital room every day? There's a rumor that CEO Yang's about to make a big move, that he's after your life. Don't worry. I'll definitely return to my body. No matter what. But you shouldn't. What? You obtained a fresh new body... Well, doing military service again could be a drawback, but it's better than living in a coma. Don't eat. Meet us at Burger Prince after the 7th period, all right? By the intersection. We have some proposals. Sorry, but I have student council meetings today. We got plenty of time, we can wait until midnight. I can't do that... - Of course you can. - We're good at waiting. Could you step aside? She can't walk through. Go ahead. She stinks up the hallway whenever she walks by. - What? - Stop it. It's nothing. I'm going to quit school. Find me a place for me to stay. You're leaving right away, boss? I figured out the cause of the accident, so no need to stay any longer. And the boy's father's a bit much. You should stay a while. Enjoy your youth and school meals too. What the hell? Hey, kiddo! Take this. Do you resent me or something? I told you not to get involved in my business. You did all that for nothing. I'm sorry, I don't remember well. Oh Hyeon Jeong! Where did you go after skipping class yesterday? You didn't even come by to eat. It's embarrassing, I can't eat at the pub. You can eat before the drinkers come in. Hyeon Jeong's Pub Mi Seon? Wait, are you Dong Hyeon? Hey, kid! It's been so long! You should come by more often! You've gotten so much cooler. He injured his head recently and lost his memories. Go home. Stay for a meal. Mi Seon, why are you here? Where... are your manners?! How dare you call an adult by their first name?! He injured his head, he's not himself! That has nothing to do with manners! You little brat! Am I your pal or something? Where are you going? Run! Go! Mi Seon... is Hyeon Jeong's mom? Are you dying for a beating? You've got a foul mouth for someone who wants to become an announcer. There's, uh... something on your hair... Ow! What are you doing?! Kim Dong Hyeon grabbed Oh Hyeon Jeong's hair. I'm sorry... Are the two losers splitting up? Paternity Test Results In order to confirm that Jang Pan Su and Oh Hyeon Jeong are father and daughter, 16 types of genes... 99.999% positive. It's too dangerous! She's... my daughter? Hyeon Jeong? That's what science says, 99.9%. She is definitely your daughter. It's an awkward situation, but may I congratulate you a bit? The Caramel macchiato and mango banana frappuccino's ready. Dammit... Is something wrong? - Shit! - What is it? Where is it?! Hey, Oh Hyeon Jeong! Hey! Did you steal my lip tint? It wasn't me. I left it in my locker earlier. You're the only one who stayed behind in the classroom during gym class! Yun Ji, it's useless now. If she touched it, it's rotted away already. - I stole it! - What? I've always wanted one, so I took it. You stole it? He went full crazy. Then show me. I put some on and tossed it. The color wasn't my style. You fucking bastard. Pervert? What's going on? Back to your seats. Turn to page 206. Japan took part in the invasion and deployed their national guards. Japan was the victor in the Sino-Japanese war. Four targets. Break one arm and leg each. Show no mercy. But boss... I don't think this is right... Minors aren't my field of expertise... So, you won't do it? For these kinds of problems, I think you should consult with her directly. Hyeon Jeong is an outcast? Because of me? Not just because of you. There's her grades, and other complicated issues. I should call her homeroom teacher first... From what I saw, perhaps because they wanted not to make a problem out of it, the teachers seemed to overlook it. Then... what am I supposed to do? Um, I came here to consult you about it... It's all my fault... I shouldn't have raised her as a single mother in this kind of environment. Jang Pan Su, that bastard! That rotten bastard! He doesn't even know his daughter is living like this. He's probably living a great life, that trash bastard. Then, how about... I take care of the situation? You? If I talk openly with the kids, maybe it could help. Pan Su embezzled 3 billion won (approx.$3 million)? Check for yourself, dad. Transaction Record: Total - 3 billion won. What... can I do to... become close to my daughter? I'm still single... Right. Though I think physical affection could be the best solution. And if your body and mind become healthy as well, that's even better. Is that so? By the way, boss. I think you should work on your appearance a bit. Before you return to your body, diabetes and high blood pressure could get to you first. The doors are closing. It was you? You told my mom to send me here? What do you mean? I came here to lose weight. I'm not going to do this with you here. I'm going. Says who? From now on, I'm your trainer, Master Bang Man Cheol. Could I just get a refund? Shut your mouth, girl!

We're having a meat party tonight, wait for me, my son! Jong Gi! Made some money? Boys, don't hit his face. What's that? If you give me a little more time... But there isn't any! Hey, muscle heads! Muscle heads? You're a brave kid. Who are you? And you? Kid! I have a loan that I need to be paid back. Head on home now! This isn't 1988, are you still doing business like this? Dong Hyeon, go home, all right? Your son? Hey! Come here. You come here. Did you hear that?! Kim Dong Hyeon, listen to me! Go home! How did you raise him? Look at his attitude! Watch your own attitude. I've had it with this bastard. Goddammit! Son of a bitch! Dong Hyeon! No! Please! Dong Hyeon, no, not him! Step on him! The kid. Let me go! Kick that little shit! That's enough, stop it! What a tenacious prick. I'll give you one week, call me with 80 million won (approx.$70,500). Get off of me. They're gone. Mister, can you hear me? Hey, Mr. Kim Jong Gi. Wake up! Who are you? - Got a boyfriend? - What? Close your eyes. What's with the commotion?! Who's Choi Dong Gu? Hand up. That'd be me, who the hell are you? Hand. You have a man named Kim Jong Gi among those who owe you money. Yes, yes, yes. How about we lightly erase his debt away with an eraser? It's not a small amount, we can't just erase it. Have you never used white-out in school? With interest, 80 million won over two years is... The principal must have been about 5 million won (approx.$4,500), right? Yes, you are correct, but that's still... You know CEO Jang Pan Su of Hanho Partners? Of course I do. But what about him? Kim Jong Gi is his father. What? It's all right. Just accept it. But that doesn't... What's this? This is amazing! Incredible! How are you feeling? If I pass out, you should take me to the hospital, you know. I got a call from the loan sharks. They'll drop the interest, they just want me to pay back the principal. My left jab worked. So what? Hey, son! Don't lose so much weight. You're handsome as you are. Hot, that's hot! So hot! Teacher! Teacher! - Dammit. - Sorry. Screw that, my lunch is all rotten now. My gosh... Smells like Oh Hyeon Jeong. Want a new plate? Forget it. What if it's not rotten? What? Want to bet ₩100,000 (approx.$90)? Here, you eat first. What did you just say? Are you nuts? You fucking loser trying to be cool? Do you really want to mess up your school life? It doesn't matter, it's already messed up. But I'd like to change that. Dammit! Dig in. I'm treating you for helping with Hyeon Jeong's problem. Is this... It's mackerel ramen. I'm not sure if you'll like it. I used to eat this a lot with someone back in the days. I just tried making it. It's great, you should put this on the menu... No way. I don't need a reminder of him. Him? Hyeon Jeong's dad. Were things bad with him? I still regret it when I think about him. What do you regret? Not killing him. I'm sorry. Actually, you remind me of him quite a bit. He used to wipe everything down too. I'll pack you a few dishes so go eat with your dad. Thank you. Ma'am - A soju please. - Sure thing. Where did you go? I had a guest. I was saying... Here you go. Hey! Firm ass! What was that? Lady, is this your son? Your mom's pretty, so I touched her. Do you want to die? You arrogant bastard, how dare you treat your customer like this?! Don't you want to make money? Don't yell at the boy! You bitch! Let me go! Dong Hyeon... Go inside, I'll take care of this. You go home, all right? Shit, that's so sweet, eh? Mi Seon, are you all right? Get in the kitchen. Now. - You... - Listen to me. How dare you... If you're drunk you should quietly head home, you fucking bastard. Look at this punk. You son of a bitch! You grabbed my woman's hair? Who are you? Are you sleeping with her? Stop, please! You'll kill him! Who are you? Answer me! Why do you keep calling me Mi Seon?! You expect me to believe that? You body-swapped after an accident? Yes, I admit that you talk and act like him. But that doesn't mean you're Jang Pan Su. You have a small peach-shaped mole by your belly button. What? If you're okay with it, want me to tell you about more intimate spots? Wait... In which restaurant did we first meet? Arpeggio in Yeonnam-dong, you ordered a caffé latte, I ordered a Bud. Where did we break up? Coffee shop in Sinsa Hotel. That was the last time you looked for me, and you ordered a lemon tea. Are you... really Jang Pan Su? Yes. Why didn't you tell me you were pregnant with Hyeon Jeong? Sorry, but she's not your daughter. I already did a paternity test. Right, that's what Jang Pan Su would do. My turn to ask. Why show up here like this out of the blue? We were over a long time ago. You thought I'd be moved if you kicked out a few drunks? You're still... a gangster. And don't get confused. I did not raise your kid, it's my kid I raised. You don't have the right to be a father. Leave. - Mi Seon, listen... - Get out! Should I call the police? You didn't answer my calls, and you even moved away. You said you can't live with a criminal. Of course! What kind of woman wants her man to be involved in illegal work? That's why. I told you our paths are different. I'm getting married next month, to my chairman's daughter. What? Let's leave our memories in the past. No need to get pathetic and worked up now. Pan Su... I'm leaving. Did you say something wrong to my mom again? She told me to never meet you again. I made a mistake. To your mom. You dropped formalities with her again, didn't you? You're Oh Hyeon Jeong of Class 2, right? Um, yeah... I'm having a birthday party at my villa this weekend, do you want to come? I want to throw one last party and hang out with friends before we become seniors. I can come? Of course! I'll take that as a yes and call you later. Let's go. Do you like him? No way. He must be, you're blushing. No way! I'm off. Please see me, I'm begging you. You came. Um, happy birthday. Thank you. Shall we? Hey, hi. Get us some grilled meat. Sure, go inside. Why isn't he here yet? What took you so long? You said you wouldn't call for me on weekends. Yo! Whine one more time and I'll call Cheol Ho. Leave that and piss off. Oh Hyeon Jeong must be having a blast by now. She was so happy to be invited. She's so clueless, stupid bitch. She deserves it. You came. What do you want? Anything. Caffé latte for her and a Bud for me. May I see your ID? I'll take the Bud and an orange juice for him. Sure. What do you have to say? I know you won't forgive me no matter what I say. But I want you to know that I really regret it and am sorry. If it wasn't for this kind of situation, if this unbelievable thing didn't happen, would you have apologized? No, would you have even looked for me? You lived just fine until now. Wasn't I someone burdensome, someone you wanted to erase from your life? Mi Seon. Then what's different now? You're married and have a wife. I just... So don't make me more miserable. ♫ You are my destiny ♫ ♫ You are my destiny ♫ Mi Seon, what I... You bastard! Mi Seon please, listen to me, alright? Just once, please? I'm sorry, I really am. How dare you kiss me! Do I look that easy? You're driving me mad. Let's go. Let's go to the police. Wait, going to the police is a bit much... It's me, what is it? I just heard something strange, Hyeon Jeong may be in trouble. Where? We'll have to go to the police station later. Something urgent came up. Hey! Man Cheol? Bring me a car. Dong Hyeon, is it okay for a minor to drive? Shut up and you better give me proper directions. Is this the right way? It is, but... Cheol Ho will kill me. Better than getting killed by me. - Are you all right? - Don't! Here. Drink. Bottoms up. No, thanks, I can't drink. You can't back out now. Everyone's watching, save me some face. How does me drinking this save you face? We put on this party for you, so if you're like this it's disappointing. Just go with the flow, Hyeon Jeong. What do you mean? Come on, drink. Goddammit... Why would anyone invite an outcast like you to a party? - Cheol Ho recommended a loser who wouldn't retaliate. - You fucking bastard. Who do you think you are? You bitch. Don't you know who his father is? Forget it. Can I help you? This is a members only— What is that? Dong Hyeon! Who are you? What's all this? I'm just having some fun with friends. Aren't we? - Yeah! - Yeah! Let's go, you don't belong here. Where are you going? We're just getting started, she can't leave now. Boys. Dong Hyeon! Bunch of little brats... Kim Dong Hyeon, did you lose your brain after bumping your head? Get him. What the fuck are you, uhm? Hey, what's up? Shit! Is he a goddamn monster or what? My punch tastes different, huh? Cute prick. Hey. Hit me. Cheol Ho! Get it together! I'm fine, I just slipped. Come on! Oh no! He's so cool... Son of a bitch! Dress neatly, huh? Let me go, you bastard! You want to die? What, are you going to hit me? Try me, asshole. You crazy bitch. Help me! I can't swim! Help! Are you all right? Yeah. Well done. Let's get out of here. What's this? By the chairman's order, no one is allowed inside. I looked into it, and everyone thinks that you got into an accident while embezzling 3 billion won. Your wife is siding with CEO Yang. How should I proceed? Hyeon Jeong told me everything. Did you get hurt? You know... How is she? If you're worried about her, leave her now. Forever. Mi Seon. What exactly can you do for her in that body? What if she finds out? Alright. I'll do that. What do you want? Did you come for Hyeon Jeong? Why? Want to get your revenge on her? No, it's not like that. I just wanted to apologize to you two. Are you going out with her? Are you nuts?! We're definitely not like that! In that case, what about me? You want me to date a high school chick? You're in high school too. Anyways, my answer is no. Go home and study. Here. I'm off! What a pest... Dong Hyeon, I like you! What are you doing here? What did Yoon Ji want? It's nothing. Did she confess to you? It's nothing like that. So are you going out with her? Why would you go to jail when you're over 40? 40? Who? Whatever, I'm not going to date her. So forget it. Then date me. Hey! Honestly, didn't you like me? Then why are you so nice to me? I just confessed to you! Give me an answer by this weekend! You confessed to who? Dong Hyeon. You like him too. Are you insane?! No! Never! Not in a million years! He's a weirdo, don't even think about it! I told you he saved me at the party. He risked his life to rescue me. Hyeon Jeong. Hyeon Jeong, please. Listen to me, this is all wrong. Tell me why I can't. He takes care of me and cherishes me like a father. That's exactly why! I grew up without a dad. I can't even have a boyfriend who's like a dad? Will you just listen to me? What exactly did you do to make her confess to you?! It's a misunderstanding, I only wanted to be good to her. Does it feel good to ruin our lives completely? Mi Seon... Leave at once, and don't ever come back! If you ever show up around Hyeon Jeong, you and I are both dead. What can I do for you to forgive me? If there was a way to do that, I would have forgiven you already. Even if I did forgive you, this would be an affair. Or did you forget? An affair? What do you mean? Hyeon Jeong... What did you mean? Forgive? An affair? Why would the two of you talk about such things? Hyeon Jeong. I'm sorry. I... I love your mom. - What? - What! Hyeon Jeong, that's not it, listen to me. This is why you were mad at me when I said I asked him out? Hyeon Jeong... So disgusting... Hyeon Jeong... Hyeon Jeong! Jang Pan Su, why did you say that?! Well, what's done is done, and it's better than dating my own daughter. What? You crazy bastard! How could you even say that, you crazy bastard! Can I help you? What the hell?! Jang Pan Su! It's a good day to die, no? Look at this prick's beard. You should've led a good life. You lived like a fucker, and so you're fucked. Pan Su. Don't hate me too much. We all live once, so I'll send you away comfortably. Mister, your fly's down. Huh? Thank you. What?! You! There. Dong Hyeon? Good timing, I made a special dish... Dad... I became a weird old man... What do I do, dad? Don't call me dad, who are you? I'm your son, Dong Hyeon! Kim Dong Hyeon! Excuse me, I think you have the wrong house. This... isn't your home... Wait, you're... CEO Jang Pan Su? I'm Dong Hyeon! I have no memory after I slipped and fell off the roof! What do I do, dad? Stay back! Please! - Dad! - Don't come near me! Dad! Daddy! What is it? - Dad! Dad! - Get out of here! What in the world? How did you wake up? You look a lot like someone... Wait, are you me? But I lost so much weight! Dammit, yes, I'm you. By the way, is your body all right? Dad! He's a thief! He stole my body! Call the police! Call 911! Geez... Hey, why did you... He got hurt because of you, how can you hit him? I'm sorry, my son injured his head... Why did you hit me? Be quiet and just sit down. I'll explain everything. That's impossible. So you're saying this man's you, and you're this man. Right. Then I have to live the rest of my life as an old man? Daddy... Yes, sir, you were saying? I don't know what will happen next. You gained 30 years but I lost the middle 30 years of my life. This is so unfair... Unfair? Listen, kid. Who lost all that tremendous amount fat for you? - Am I right? - That's true. Whose side are you on, dad? My apologies, sir. Stop speaking so formally, it's me, Dong Hyeon! I'll get used to it eventually. Wait a minute. You expect me to believe all this? You two are trying to trick me! Right? I'm not done, sit back down. You little... - Dad, sit. - Yes, sir. When I was six years old and got the measles, you had a bike accident and we stayed in the same hospital. A bottle cap got suck in my throat when I was in the third grade and almost died, and you pulled it out and saved my life. I remember, sir. I'm your son, Dong Hyeon, you gave me that name. - Are you... - Dad... - really Dong Hyeon? - Dad! How in the world did this happen? Dad... Mister, you're a smoker, right? I get so much mucus! You have a wart on your ass. It hurts whenever I sit. In any case, you need to help me. Me? You like Hyeon Jeong, right? If you help me, I'll help you date her. Shit, when I woke up, he was already gone! How could you screw up? You said it'd be no problem! Hey! Am I your husband? Watch your mouth. If he goes to dad... My boys are searching for him, so you go get the damn money! I shouldn't have listened to that greedy pig. How dare she! Got it. We found the taxi driver who drove Jang Pan Su. Mi Seon. What's going on? When this old man woke up, we switched souls again. I'm the real Dong Hyeon and this old man is the real Pan Su. Your souls swapped back? This ol—, I mean, the boy is right. I'm really sorry. I want to apologize with all my heart. I've never once forgotten about you. You... So hard to find! Who are you? Jang Pan Su. You should've led a quiet life, dealing with only what you can handle. Tie them up together and toss them in the ocean. Yes, boss. Excuse me, one moment please. What is it? You want to say your last words? Save us please... I just woke up, I can't die like this... Who are you people? Sorry ass, being in a coma made you very weird. You two get in the kitchen. Yes. What's this? What can you do by yourself? Hold on! Make sure she doesn't come out. Yes, sir. Wait... Ma'am, stay here. They're really scary men! I'm so scared, come on. What a load of shit. Boys. Bring them out. Look at this punk. CEO Yang, chatty as usual. Yang? How dare you bark at an adult, you little baby prick! Watch your mouth! - So what? - "So what?" I've heard this somewhere before... Who the hell are you?! I'm obviously a high school student. Got a problem with that? High school? Which grade and class? Enough questions, come at me. There isn't much time until the pub opens. This is nuts... Why are you standing around? Get rid of this high schooler. Hey, Section Chief Jo. Where's Jo? Are you sleeping? Section Chief? You can fight some. Take your tie off, asshole. - Boys. - Yes, sir! Ma'am, don't go out! Please, stay here... Please don't go... Let's wrap this up. I... told you to take your tie off, you bastard. What? Hey. Yo. Buddy! Jang Pan Su, watch this! Dammit, I shouldn't be killing minors. Stop! Don't hurt him! Fuck... He's the father of my child. Your child's what? Father of my child! So, if you touch him, we all die. What the fuck!... I'm going to count to 5. If you don't leave by then, we die together. If you want to live, you better run now. Hey, lady! If you light that, you die too. Do I look like I'm afraid to die? This asshole destroyed my life, and I've barely made it until now! Why, doesn't look like it? Did you think that I lived fine without you?! Why do you think I kept her, dammit... I wanted to raise a child that at least resembled you! I gave you a chance, but you still left me. What is she saying? After all this time, did you think a simple apology will work, you bastard! She's completely mad. Did she just say that she had this boy's child? If you don't want to die, get out of my pub now. One! Wait, wait, wait! Stop it, you gangster! You're no different! Two! Three! We better leave! But Jang Pan Su is in there! Four! No! No, let's go! Quickly! Mi Seon... Are you all right? Lady, I smell gas in here. I feel dizzy. Stay back. I have something to say to him. - Mi Seon. - I know, I know! But... the one I loved is Jang Pan Su over there, so just... I've waited so long. Jang Pan Su. Watching Hyeon Jeong grow up more and more like you, whenever I see her face, I missed you so much. You can't even imagine it. One year turned into ten, and after seventeen years passed, we finally meet like this. Do I look old? Thank you. Yes, it's this face. What's going on, dad? Do you know what I detest the most? What? Holding a knife against your family. Dear Chairman Han, my father-in-law, If you're reading this letter, I've already fallen victim to their conspiracy, and I would be labeled as your traitor. He states that you plotted a conspiracy with Yang. It's impossible, dad. How can someone in a coma write this letter? His handwriting has already been verified! This really is impossible! CEO Yang approached me after the accident, so how could he... In other words, are you admitting that you conspired with CEO Yang? Come in. Boss, is it all right to send him in alone? Who'd believe me if I went in? The chairman wants Jang Pan Su. Don't say anything else, stick to my plan. I called for him. Have a seat. Jang Pan Su, what exactly are you planning? Shut your mouth! What should we do now? Ask the chairman what he wishes. Ask chairman what he wishes! What did you say? I mean, ask you, Chairman, what he, no, what you would like to do. I am going to make you the offical successor to Hanho Group! Dad! Including all the money you stole, I will give all your assets to the company! How could you? I'm your daughter! You won't get any inheritance whatsoever, so don't ever come back! What about what he did to me? He had an affair without me knowing, and has a high school daughter! You thought I wouldn't investigate you? You went straight to her pub after leaving the hospital. Is this true? Uh, tell him it's a misunderstanding. I, umm... mister... Sir, I can't hear you. Hey, Kim Dong Hyeon. Can you hear me? Sir, I need your help. I can't hear you. Explain yourself! - It's true. - What?! But the child wasn't born while I was living with this lady. The Ex-girlfriend gave birth without him, I mean, me, knowing anything about it and raised her. Do you even hear yourself? The fact is, that you have a daughter, you son of a bitch! Don't swear, lady. Hyeon Jeong is a lovely girl. Dad, listen to him, he's gone mad. How could he say that?! Stay out of this! Continue. I finally understood after the accident. Should I go in? What can bring more happiness than living with your family that you love? Are you saying you will give up on being the successor? I don't know how rich you are, but yes. What did he just say? You're giving everything up, are you sure you won't regret it? I've lived so far with plenty of regrets until now. But I'm telling you this so that I won't have to have regrets anymore. You're all crazy. Good bye, ma'am. As the father of a foolish child... I have no right to stop you. Do as you wish. Thank you. I'll then... Goodbye. Kim Dong Hyeon! Thank you. You're a better man than me. You too. You fight really well. Crazy idiots... Mister, wake up! Boss. You have to keep the mask on! Man Choel, take care of... Hyeon Jeong from... CEO Yang... I understand... Expert Clean Operation Center Mister, wake up, Hyeon Jeong is here! Dong Hyeon! Excuse me... Mom, this man... is he my dad? I saw him in a old photo album you hid away. Am I right? Hyeon Jeong... I... I am your dad. What? My daughter, Hyeon Jeong. That's absurd. Don't tell me... you two already got married? What? No, it's nothing like that. I'm really your dad. I am... really, truly sorry. I wasn't there when you were born, when you said your first word, or when you took your first step. I was never there with you... What's this bullshit? My Hyeon Jeong... Your dad loves you. Never forget that... Pan Su... - Dong Hyeon! - Mister! - Dong Hyeon! - I...! Help! Over here! Dong Hyeon! Boss! I mean, boss! Did you like my present? Granny! It was hard taking care of your woman and daughter, right? Get some sleep. Six months later - It's Kim Dong Hyeon! - Wow! - He's here! - Wow! Hey, Dong Hyeon! Kim Dong Hyeon! Kim Dong Hyeon! Kim Dong Hyeon! Kim Dong Hyeon! Thanks to you, Min Woo and Cheol Ho got transferred. Things are so great now. Hey, Oppa! Want to go get some strawberry milk? Hyeon Jeong, hey... - How do you know Mrs. Jang? - How do you feel? I'll fully cooperate with the police's investigation. But it was all Jang Pan Su's fault! That punk ass high school boy! He got a kid to fight! What kind of man doesn't have any strength! Knead the dought with more power! The kids are going to get out of school soon. - What about him? Jong Gi isn't very good either... - He's way better than you. I'm pretty good at kneading. Oh, come on, I even gave you this building. Aren't you using me too much? You think I am the sort of person who would play around and live off of others' rent? Do you know the value of labor? Sorry, boss, landlady, I'll do my best. - Yes. - Yes. - I'm back! - Come on in. - Good afternoon! - Hello, Dong Hyeon. Go get changed, start cleaning the tables, and sweep the floors. I'll do it, ma'am. See? He wants to do it. Why make me... Do it together then. Mom, promise you'll at least pay me minimum wage. Or I'll file a report saying it's unfair labor practices. - What? - Hey, kiddo. Report for me too and I'll bump your allowance. They're scheming! - Keep kneading! - Yes, ma'am! Get changed right away! - Alright. - Boss? Where do you want this? Go put it somewhere. I was asking our landlady boss. - Put it in the kitchen, please. - Alright. Ma'am, do I have to work in these clothes during this weather? Yes, there's a lot of female students in this neighborhood. Please do me this favor. Quite cold isn't it? We'll open very soon! - Knead! Knead! - Kneading! Kneading! Come on out! Where are my clothes? In there! Almost done! - Come on, hurry! - Guys! Is it good here?
