You tell Bowman Magazine they agreed to put my client on the cover of their spring edition, not some back-end feature. We gave you guys an exclusive. If you're not gonna to run it, I know Town Press would love to give it the front-page placement it deserves. Cover and a five-page spread? Yeah, I think we can make that work. - Hi, Dad! - Here she is. Lyla, Rory's on the line. - Hi, honey! - Hi, Mom! We can't wait to see you. I am so excited for you to finally see Lily Lake after all these years. And to renew her vows to the love of her life. Oh. Yeah. That too. Oh, you guys! Yeah, I'm excited. It'll be good to get out of the city and not think about He Who Must Not Be Named. So no word from Jason? - Tom! - What? I was just asking. No, no... it's fine. And no, radio silence. You're still okay to drive your sister? Yeah, yeah, she's meeting me here. We'll leave as soon as I finish work, which will hopefully be soon. Well, don't work too hard! Mom, Dad, I'll see you at the lake. I gotta go. Okay, love you. Bye, bye, bye. - Hi, Melody! - Morning, Rory. How's Anne's story over at Bowman Magazine? Confirmed cover and a five-page spread. Hits newsstands next week. I thought they were downgrading it. Turns out they had a change of heart. That's no small feat for a junior publicist. Melody? You remember I don't always wanna be a junior publicist, right? You're going away the rest of this week, right? Yes, but it is just for a very quick trip. - During our busiest season. - The thing is, it's my parents' anniversary, and they're renewing their vows at the B&B where they met almost four decades ago. But I can clearly see you don't care about that, and that's understandable, because it will be a working trip for me, because I will be working... on the trip. Good. Then I look forward to seeing Anne's full press plan - on my desk by the end of day. - Okay. Traveling light, as always. Well, I like to be prepared. - For... - Anything and everything a springtime adventure can offer. Right. Okay. Again, Prepared. Oh, hey, Dad. Hey, Noah. You doing okay? I already told you, I got it all under control. I know I left you with a lot. I'm glad you're enjoying time with Aunt Mary. You never get to see your sister. Yeah, it was good to catch up with her. - You enjoy this. - I will. You deserve it. I can jump on a plane tomorrow. Not gonna happen, Dad. - Okay, I gotta go. - Noah? - I love you. - Love you too, Dad. Lily Lake B&B, this is Noah. Oh, hey, Mrs. Gardener. Yeah, the new appliances, I'm so sorry. It's... it's been a bit of a slow season, I'm... I'm so sorry, I'll put the check in the mail right now. Okay. Thanks so much. Bye-bye. It's gorgeous. Wow. Their social media really doesn't do it justice. Yeah! There they are. You made it! Hi, yes, better late than never. Guys, this place is amazing! You wanna see the lake? Oh yeah, let's show 'em our spot. Sorry, it's work. Um... I'll get us checked in, you guys go. Hello? Hello, is anybody here? Hello? 'Scuse me, I would like to check in... please. Also, I have an emergency. Do you have Wi-Fi? Does anybody work here?! Excuse me, sir? Shout about it Keep it coming ♪ ♪ I'm going now nobody telling me nothing no ♪ ♪ Dress it up To the top ♪ What are you doing in here? I tried to ring the bell! Check-in isn't until four. It's 4:03. I'll be with you in a moment. No, no, no, I'll help. Some, uh, pretty nice dance moves you got there. Oh, uh... This wasn't important, was it? Just tax forms. I'll meet you in the lobby. No, come on. Let me help. It's really no trouble at all. Oopsie. I'll meet you in the lobby. Do you have Wi-Fi? Do you have a reservation? Yes, under Richards. Your bell's broken. I know; that's more for decorative purposes. That's misleading. I'm working on it. Here you go. Three rooms with a lake view. Great, and the... If you had looked up from your phone. I'm literally looking up from my phone right now. Hmph. Oh, and do you guys have amenities? - Like... - Like a business center or party space? We're here for my parents to renew their vows. Uhh... You, uh, saw that in the request when we booked, right? - I'm sure we did. - Mm. Um... we have the dining room, or there's the outdoor space by the lake, or the gardens. Oh! Gardens would be perfect. And I was wondering, do you have an event fee? I didn't see anything on your site. Well, yeah, our website needs to be updated. We charge for the, uh, chairs. That's an additional $50. Right. For ten people. - Okay. - And then it goes up to... $100. - Cool. - Cool. So, how many? Just ten. Unfortunately, my parents' anniversary falls on a weekday. If we could have them set on Monday, that would be great. Hypothetically, had I told you the event fee would be higher... I would have paid more. That's what I thought. Enjoy your stay! Just gorgeous, isn't it? Oh! It's like something out of a fairytale. Our fairytale. All right, we are all checked in and ready to go for the ceremony on Monday. Great. - See you girls at dinner. - Okay! Behave, you two! This weekend? Ms. Penny Traverse is coming this weekend? No, no, no... Yes, of course we can confirm! Well, consider it done. Thank you. Hello again. Hi! Hi. Um... is there something else I can help you with? Yes. My room is out of towels. Sorry about that. "Check room for towels before Penny's arrival." Oh. Penny Traverse just booked a room here. Mm, okay. - About those towels... - Oh! Yeah. - Great. - Do you know who she is? Only one of the biggest travel critics on the East Coast. My company's partnered with her before. Oh, wow. - Well, she is coming here - Oh! - This weekend. - Oh. What? Well, usually, before you invite someone from the press voluntarily into your space, - you wanna put on the Ritz. - Oh, yeah! I am. I mean... I will. That's what I thought, yeah. Knock, knock! Jason! Rory. Hi, hi, uh... What are you doing here? Quick little weekend getaway. - What about you? - Uh... Did you... follow me here? Yes, Jason. I haven't seen or spoken to you in weeks, but I followed you here to the place where my parents first met. I'm not upset or mad or anything, I'm fine. Phenomenal, even, so. Wait. How did you know about this place? I heard someone talking about it and it just kinda stuck in my mind. It was me. I am that person. I'm not sure it was you. I'm sure it was me. Hm. - Hm. - Hmm. Checking in? Um, excuse me. Um... you, uh, you look good. You been working out? Yeah. I'm good, you know, I'm busy. Yeah, busy. Yeah, me too, so busy. You know, now that I think of it, I might have tried to call you, like, once or eight times. Oh, sorry. Things at the firm have been insane. The firm. I know all about that. So, uh, what do you say? Seeing as we're both here, why don't we... grab a drink sometime? This is... you... Oh. Wow. So. I'm Rory. Rory Richards? Jason and I used to date. - Quite a while ago. - Yeah, yeah, right. We don't do that anymore, obviously, because, uh, you guys are, and... this is a thing, and I'm just so happy for you! Yeah, yeah, because, uh... I'm here with my guy. With my guy. My person. It's him. Yeah. Yeah. I thought it was about time he met my family, so the gang's all here. She's lovely. Very talkative. Nice to meet you, man. I booked two rooms, both under Wilson. Hey, there's no towels in the... Jason? Wassup? Hello, welcome! I literally have no idea... I'm just helping my guy out here with the tidal wave of guests checking in. We are so busy, right? Boop! You're... working here now? - Apparently so. - Oh, don't be silly! Sh, sh, sh, sh! Uh, no, no, I'm just here to spend time with, um... - Noah. - Noah! Noah, right, right, of course. Speaking of which, can we get these two guests checked in, honey? 'Course I can, puddin'. Yes, yes, as quick as possible, great. I guess we'll be seeing you around. All the best. Take care. Ugh! Rory. Cleo. - Anything else? - Nope! So, we'll see you and your friend at dinner? Mm... Maybe, maybe. Yeah. Please don't say anything to Mom and Dad yet. So, I don't really know what just happened, but I think I might have panicked. I saw. They saw too. - You think so? - Definitely. Oh well. I guess I need you to pretend to be my boyfriend. - Definitely not. - Gah! What do you mean? Nope! Please, Jonah! - Noah. - Right. Noah, Noah, Noah. I need you to save me from a life-ruining level of humiliation. He is with someone already. Who was that guy? I mean, other than someone who blew your heart into a million smithereens? It wasn't a million smithereens. It might have been. Fine. His name is Jason, and we might have dated for a little over a year, and I might have thought that he was going to propose, but instead, he definitely broke up with me. - Ouch! - On my birthday. - Double ouch. - In his defense, he didn't actually remember it was my birthday, but now, he is here with that really pretty blonde girl. Why would you wanna be with someone who did that to you, anyway? That is a very good question that I'm not emotionally stable enough to answer at this time. Ugghh! - Are you okay? - Uh-huh. Are you sure? You... made a funny sound. Things I need delivered before Penny's arrival - are delayed. - Like more towels. Sorry. I didn't think she'd come here the weekend I invited her. I thought it'd take, like, a month or two, or never. That's her M.O. She wants authentic, the real you. She doesn't wanna give you time to change things before she arrives. Like a bell... that does not work. I thought I could pull it off. A light renovation, a quick rebrand, bada-bing, bada-boom, a good review! Mm. I can help. I doubt it. Do you even have any relevant experience? Mm-hm. I am junior partner at Extend Publicity. I just landed my latest client the cover of Bowman Magazine, and you are way outta your depth, in my humble yet overqualified professional opinion. So, yes, I do believe I have the relevant experience, and lucky for you, I would very much like to help you. You would? If you pretend to be my boyfriend for a week. Did you just hear the words that came out of your mouth? You know what? I did. So here's what I'm offering. You be my fake boyfriend, help me convince Jason that I'm over him. I be your real PR representative and help you get a glowing review from Penny Traverse. Ah! And you yourself would also leave a good review? And your parents, and everybody else in your party? Yes, yes, anything you want. Do we have a deal? Wow, okay. If you're confident you can turn this place around... by yourself in less than a week. Fine. Deal. Deal. I, um ...will get started on your, um, PR plan right away. Whoa, now, before you go changing anything... You'll wanna review it, duh. I'm a publicist, not a tyrant. Just makin' sure, puddin'. - Boop! - Oh! You booped me. Okay. Yeah, mm-hm, thank you. What are you doing? I came to ask you the same thing, Mrs. Brand-New B&B Boyfriend. All right, so, been some updates I'll fill you in on, but first... How quickly can you make a logo? Pretty quickly. Why? What's going on? Well, I've taken on a new client who needs a full rebrand in exchange for making me look like I don't have feelings for Jason. Yeah. What is he even doing here? I don't know. It's not like he knew I was gonna be here. Or did he? You think so? No, no! No. That's insane. This is just a crazy coincidence to which I will respond like an adult. Right. With a fake boyfriend. Wait, wait, wait. Don't follow me. I'm faster than you. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, hang on a second! How exactly are you gonna convince Jason that this guy is your real boyfriend? - You know nothing about him! - No, but I will. What's his favorite color? Does he snore? How does he take his coffee? I don't know the answer to those questions yet, but I do I'm not gonna let Jason get in the way of us throwing our parents a magical vow-renewal ceremony. Right. And cute B&B Guy will be the perfect buffer to make this the perfect weekend? Exactly. You think he's cute? That's what you got from that? Cover for me. Couldn't keep myself away, you know what it's like! What's your favorite color, how do you take your coffee, and do you snore? I think we need to lay a few ground rules. Number one, don't freak out my staff. Right, right. Oh, it smells good in here. Thank you. Food is one thing I know we have down for sure. You made this? More or less. How 'bout the food? That was insane. What are you talkin' about? I was flirting. - You're trying too hard. - No I'm not. - You need to relax. - I'm physically unable to relax. I noticed. What can I do for you, Rory? Right, um, so I was thinking maybe you could have dinner with us tonight? Oh, no, we don't dine with the guests. Okay, so if you won't join us, can I join you in here? Uh, why? If you're going to be my fake boyfriend, I need to get to know you. Also, I need to coach you for your interview with Penny Traverse. My what? Yeah, she's gonna interview you without interviewing you. You know what I mean? - I do not. - You gotta be ready, be on. You gotta give her all the details, sell her the experience, but in, like, a conversational kinda way, starting with your traditions. We don't have any traditions. Well, not anymore, you don't, but from what I read online, you guys used to. Okay. "Spring at the Lily Lakes Bed & Breakfast is one of the most magical experiences available in the area. From the incredible home-cooked meals," which you're still doing, so that's exciting, "to the homey amenities, the myriad of spring activities, traditions, and events, this B&B is a must-see for a springtime getaway." "Lily Lake Gazette, 1973." You sure work fast. Yes. Yes, I do. Okay. I guess one dinner with the guests wouldn't hurt. But if I'm gonna have a fake girlfriend, I'm gonna take advantage of it. Oh. Oh, right, thank you. Mm! And, um, what will you be carrying? Our finest champagne. If we're gonna trick your family, we can at least treat them. - Hm! - Chop, chop, chef. Ok, where am I going with these? Straight through there - Straight through here? - To the right Oh, right. These people? Hi. Hello, it's your, um... this, sir. - There you go, enjoy. - Enjoy your meal. Mom, Dad? I would like to introduce you to my new boyfriend, Noah. - Your... - New boyfriend? - Mm-hm. - I... didn't realize... He and his dad own the B&B, so if you see me helping them out, it's because I care about him... My new boyfriend. My new boyfriend, Noah. Well, how lovely to meet you. Noah, these are my parents, Lyla and Tom. It is such a pleasure to meet you both. Oh, Noah, the pleasure's ours. A bottle of our finest. - No, we didn't order... - Oh, please, it's on the house. Thank you! That's very kind of you, Noah. I understand a vow-renewal ceremony is happening. Congratulations. Thank you. You know, Lyla and I met here back when your grandparents owned it. Stanley and Mimi were incredibly generous people. This has always been a really special place for us. So, how did you two meet? Yes. How did you two meet? - Through mutual friends. - Online. Through mutual friends... online. We are very happy. Yes. Wildly happy. Right. If you'll excuse me, I have to just go and hide... Hydrate the sauce. It's, uh... Excuse me. Oh. Oh! Uh... Well. He seems lovely. And how cool that you're dating the grandson of the people who started this place? It's just incredible. Yeah, it's almost, um... unbelievable. Almost! Yeah, I don't feel right about this. What? Wait... why? - Your parents are nice people. - Thank you. I agree. - So I don't like lying to them. - Hold on. Do you wanna date me for real? What?! No. No! Noah, I think you do! - You like me! - Right, sure, okay. That is not what I am saying at all. Then what exactly are you saying, Noah? I'm saying that this adds a whole extra level of crazy to this deal of ours. I can't have Jason and his literally perfect new girlfriend thinking that I am very sad and very single. But you are very sad and very single. Yes, but he doesn't know that. And I would very much like to keep it that way. Please? Please, I am begging you. Okay. We get through this week. You get us that good review from Penny Traverse, and then we have an amicable breakup that somehow allows your parents to still think highly of this place and maybe not hate me. - Perfect! - Perfect. Perfect. You can take care of the rest of this on your own. We've got a big day tomorrow. Operation: Penny Traverse is up. All right. I have to get this press plan to Melody tonight if I still wanna be considered for partner. What? You know, the first time I came here, I thought it was so far out in the sticks. Mom, it is far out in the sticks. That's what made me fall in love with it in the first place. I know you feel like you've gotta have everything right now, that things'll pass you by if you don't go at them full force. But there's so much to experience when you just slow down and take it all in. You look back one day and you realize that all the little things, they add up to be the big things in life. And that makes every moment so much more precious. Promise me you'll remember that. I promise I will. Right after I make partner. - 'Night, Rory. - G'night, Mom. Seriously, who doesn't have Wi-Fi? Hey, girl, whatcha doin'? Hi, sis. Just doodling. So with the logo, I was thinking we need to build on the history of this place. Which is... I found this article about a lily festival they used to host. - That's cute. - Yeah. That there used to be their logo. - It's really pretty. - Yeah. I wonder why they stopped using it? From what I can tell, it was when they started trying to compete with other accommodations around here. So they need to get back to their roots. Exactly! You see, a blend of the then and the now and where they want to go in the future. I mean, ultimately, we would do a full rebrand. Websites, socials, the whole shebang. Oh, don't panic, it's okay. We're just gonna start with the logo. Okay! I'm on it. The big boss lady? Yeah. Yeah, I already sent her the press plan she asked for. Now she wants me to update her EPK, finish her market research, and fire Phil from Finance. And all while literally doing someone else's PR. No. This is pro bono. This is on my own time. Isn't it kinda a conflict of interest? No. I'm doing it as a favor. Besides, Lily Lake B&B isn't an Extend client. It's fine. It's probably fine. I'm sure it's fine. Yes, we cook family dinner every night. No, there's no pool, but the lake is amazing. No, there's no TVs in the room, but the view out the window is spectacular. Sometimes I just like to sit and watch the... Hello? Good morning, honey bunny. It's some kind of morning. Oh, what happened? Okay. When you, a gal with expensive taste... What makes you think I have expensive taste? Look at you, you look like you're dressed for a business lunch. What are you talking about, this is casual. - My point exactly. - Okay. When you, a professional from a city, wants to book a weekend getaway... Oh, I don't have time for getaways. - You're on one now. - Special circumstance. - Okay, not the point. - Okay, okay. My question is, when you do book a getaway, whenever that happens to be, what are you looking for in a location? Towels in my room. I know, I know, I'm kidding. Um. I guess I want an experience. Something that feels different than my day-to-day life. But also somehow still feels like home. Does that make sense? Yeah. Penny Traverse on the other hand, now she likes a hook, places with a strong narrative. Now given the steep family history of this place, I'd really like to lean into that - for your campaign. - Really? Yeah, places like this don't just happen, Noah. They're built over years and years. - Am I wrong? - No, you're not wrong. Just guests seem to want... I thought you'd wanna update it all, bring it into the 21st century. Well, I mean, there are tweaks we need to make here and there, but this place... this place is special. Tell me all there is to know about Lily Lake B&B. I want to know everything. - Everything? - Everything. All right, but first... - we need coffee. - Hm. Let me guess, cappuccino, some kind of fancy milk, - and flawless art. - No, just black, splash of cream, and one sugar. That's my order. Are you copying me? - Hey. - Hi. Yeah, I'm looking for a little recommendation for a date day tomorrow. You know, something fun, but romantic. Mhm, um, you... There's always, uh, canoeing on the lake. - Thank you. - Uh, wine tasting in town, maybe a pottery class up on Main Street. Oh, that all sounds great. I wanna do something fun for Sarah. You know, she's a big romantic. Mhm, I'll bet, and so is Noah, he's so romantic. I am, it's, uh, true. In fact, we're actually going on a date day tomorrow. Fun. Thanks again for the recs. Bye, Jason. Um, we're going on a date day? I don't know, I was just trying to be convincing. I don't know, I think it worked, do you think it worked? Yeah, totally, I mean, it's just a fake date anyway, right? Yeah, yeah, more like a strategy meeting really. - Exactly. - Mhm. - 'Cause of the PR stuff. - PR stuff, it's... - Yeah, I get it. - That's all. - Cheers. - Cheers to that. So what drew you to the PR anyway? Well, I like that it's fast-paced, creative, and constantly changing. I also like that I'm good at it, if I do say so myself. Well, I could see you're talented. I didn't know you were so modest. Thank you. Anyway, after I graduated I got a job as an assistant at a small firm, and then I saw there was an opening at Extend. I've heard of 'em. - Really? - Don't be so surprised. I know a thing or two about a thing or two, you know? Oh, now look who's being modest. Extend hired me as a junior publicist and I've been working my way up the corporate ladder ever since. How's that going? Technically I'm still a junior publicist, but I'm working on it. Say you could have your dream job, do anything, be anywhere, what would that look like? I'd like to be closer to my family. I would like to work for a firm that focuses more on personal relationships. I want to help people, you know, discover their potential, like you and this place. Would you ever go out on your own? Oh, no, right now I'm just focused on making partner. - Right, is that what you want? - It's what I've been working on. Yeah, but how do you feel about it? I feel like you have an awful lot of questions for a tour guide. Noted. Okay then. Next stop: The tree. The tree? Not a tree, the tree. Fairies live here. When I was little my grandma used to help me write letters to them, and not always, but every now and then if I was lucky, they'd reply. Sometimes with letters, but usually with treasures or trinkets, always with words of advice, - you know, bits of fairy wisdom. - Oh. Yeah, but the thing is, - you have to be patient. - Mhm. You see, you can't rush a fairy. - Oh yeah, even I know that. - Oh good. And sometimes I just couldn't wait. I'd come down here by myself and see if they'd left anything for me. Take a look. Look way down in the back. Further. - Ah! - Ahh! Noah, I will push you in the lake! You used to do that to your grandmother? - No, she would do that to me. - Good, you deserve it. I told you to be patient. You said you knew. - Ahh. - Let me help you up. Thank you. It really is beautiful Each year for the Lily Festival, my grandparents would plant a different tree from around the world. Wow, tell me more about the Lily Festival. It started when my grandparents used to harvest the lilies for Mimi's Soaps and Candles. Every year they had way too many, so she would invite people over to give it away, and they would bring food or wine in return, and it just kinda got bigger and bigger and bigger and... That sounds so fun. - It was. - Why'd you stop? Dad took over officially when Mimi passed away and we haven't done one since. - What about your mom? - She was never really in the picture. Just me and my dad. Why don't you bring it back? It doesn't have to be huge, but I think it would be such a nice way to pay homage to your family, the spring season, the beauty of this place. It really is incredible. That's why it's so important I find a way to keep Dad from selling it. What? It's been slow, real slow. We used to be the only B&B in town, but there's so many other new, fancy hotels, we just can't keep up. Inviting Penny Traverse was my last attempt to try to turn things around, maybe save the place. You can't sell. This place holds so many memories for so many people, my parents included. Let's hope you can work your PR magic. No pressure. Come on, there's something else I need to show you. You thought I couldn't do it in heels. I don't know why I ever doubted you. - What is this place? - My grandparents' haven. Stanley the woodworker and Mimi the crafter. Wow, there are so many cool things in here. Things that need to be donated. I just can't bring myself to get rid of them. Well, don't do that. - This is pretty. - Mimi's fan. I mean, one of the fairies' fans. Right, right, of course. These things are so old and outdated and guests don't want that. I do. Well, you can have that. - Really? - Of course. Thank you Noah. I was thinking. We have to do it all before Penny's arrival, but this place has so much potential. You can host locally based events here. Woodworking, soap-making classes. Things that get people off their phone and really connecting with each other. Like look at me. I honestly don't even know where my phone is right now. Incredible. I know, right? So I don't need to turn this place - into a five-star resort? - No. No, anyone that wants that can go somewhere else. When they're here, what is it you think the guests want? I know what they want. They want technology, they want luxury. I hear it every day. "Are there TVs in the room?" "You guys have a pool?" "Oh no, the lake won't do. Has to be heated." What do you want? I love this place just the way it is. I love it too. And so will the guests. The potato chips make it so good. - Stan's secret ingredient. - Mm! - Gives it that extra crunch. - Yeah. Stan Subs... Mhm. He used to make these every Sunday for the guests. Mmm. Mimi's got a whole box of recipes. I try to make at least one every now and then. Think she used them as kind of a diary. Some of 'em go way back to when Dad was a kid. Wow. Remember Peter's debate speech, "Why Potatoes are the Superior Vegetable." Are they not the superior vegetable? Yeah, I'm assuming he won that debate. - World's shortest debate. - Yeah. Do you mind if I borrow these? Be my guest. Speaking of guests, I gotta go set the tables for dinner. Can I help? That'd be great. So how did your grandparents end up running a B&B? Well, Stanley originally built it for Mimi, but it was just too beautiful not to share, so they turned their home into a B&B and it's been part of the family ever since. - Oh. - When Dad took over I realized it just wasn't fair for him to look after it by himself, so here I am. And, uh, what were you doing before this? I was a data analyst in New York. - I'm sorry, what? - I know. Moving back here just helped me slow down, gave me more time for the things I love, like cooking, photography, woodworking. Oh, is there anything you don't do? - Just don't ask me to dance. - Oh, was not planning on it. So you really just left your whole life behind? - Mhm. - Everything you had in the city? I don't even miss it. - Hm. - Uh-oh. This is the wrong tablecloth. These are Mimi's old ones. Or... What if we kept the old one? See, I was thinking, we need to bring back more of our old traditions. Give the guests, like, an experience that's different from the day to day, but somehow still feels... Like home. Huh. That kinda sounds like you approve of the direction of my PR campaign. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. - Uh-oh. - Wait, but, please. Trouble in paradise. - I have no idea. - I... I have... there's... there's... Jason, it's the phone or it's me. That's what I thought, don't follow me. I should go check on him. - You okay? - Yeah. No. What, date day not go well? Uh, it might've been too little too late. - Can I ask you something? - Of course. - What happened with us? - You broke up with me. But before. I felt like things were going so well with us, and then one day I realized we never really saw each other. Yes, and then you broke up with me. To set you free. It wasn't fair to you, I mean, to either of us. We were both so focused on work and networking, keeping clients happy. We never saw each other. Well, yeah, but I thought that was temporary. I wanted to hold on. But I don't think it was temporary. Sarah and I just broke up for the same reason, but it was more one-sided this time. What do you mean? I thought that if I found someone who wasn't as work focused as I am that maybe it could work, but, eh, no deal. The date day was a last-ditch effort to try to put her ahead of work, but that... - I got this... - You didn't. It was an important client, I had to take his call. Jason, you beautiful idiot. Oh, I know, I know! For what it's worth, I'm glad you found someone who makes you happy. Ah, I'm sorry, this is so mopey and depressing. No. It's real. Come here, give me a hug. I should go back inside. So what's the deal with you and Jason? I don't know. Well, how do you feel? Well, part of me feels like if he asks me to get back together again, I would say yes. - Really? - Yeah. I mean, we're both so focused on work that maybe I don't know if we gave it a real shot. - You can move on until you do. - Love is complicated. - I'll say. - Whoa. That was a loaded "I'll say." I just don't know if I'm really built for love. What does that even mean? I don't I've ever really been, like, in love, in love. Just because it hasn't happened yet doesn't mean it's never going to. You have to really open yourself up, let somebody in. Maybe in another life. For now a very real business and a fake girlfriend is more than enough for me. Hello? Okay, two things: One, I realized we have no flowers for the vow renewal ceremony, and two, we forgot to book a photographer. I'm sorry, that is totally my fault. I will do it first thing in the morning. It's okay, you've had so much on your plate. - We'll figure something out. - That is not an excuse. This is important to Mom and Dad, and now I've gotten so sidetracked with work and this thing with Noah. About that. I have a logo for you. Well, almost, I'm putting the final touches on it tonight. - Great. - Uh-huh, and I'm gonna show you and Mr. fake boyfriend man at the same time tomorrow - for the big reveal. - Sounds perfect. - Cute fan. - It's a little gift from Noah's grandma. Night. Goodnight. ♪ I gotta say by the way you look inside me ♪ ♪ I wanna melt ♪ ♪ I want to smile ♪ ♪ But I know the little games we play, you and I ♪ ♪ 'Cause I can tell you think about her ♪ ♪ It's just the games we play ♪ - Good morning. - Good morning. Okay, I was thinking, before we get started on the PR stuff today, I need to find a last-minute photographer and a florist for the ceremony. Do you know where I could find those? You still wanna work on PR stuff? Well, of course, why wouldn't I? Well, I just figured you and Jason seem to be hitting it off again. Sarah just checked out early, so you know, you don't really need a fake boyfriend anymore. I figured our deal was off. Oh. At least this way we don't have to waste time planning fake dates slash strategy meetings. I can get back to preparing for Penny's arrival and you can get back to your clients. Back to Jason. Sure. If that's what you want. Ladies and gentlemen, please adjourn to the sitting room. Noah, Rory, thank you both for coming. It is my great honor to be a part of this rebrand, fake romance situation. And equal parts excited and terrified to show you my work. Cleo is one of the most talented artists I know. Undiscovered, obviously, hence why I'm working as a receptionist. - For now. - For now. Anyway, not the point. Noah, Rory's filled me in on operation do a full rebrand in record time before Penny Traverse gets here, and I have created a logo that I think captures what you guys are going for. - Are you ready? - Yes. Yeah, okay. Oh, Cleo, this is... Perfect. - Thank you, Cleo. - Oh, I'm so glad you guys like it. Honestly, I'm so proud of it and more than happy to help. Is this what you do, graphic design? Well, not yet. You know, my friend Laycee owns Motif NYC. I'd be happy to connect you guys. - Motif? - Yeah. - As in the design firm Motif? - Yeah. Send me your portfolio, I'll forward it along. Oh, my God, I will! - Like right now! - Okay. - Ah! - Bye, Cleo. Oh, thank you. She has been trying so hard to break into the industry. I know she's my sister, but trust me, she is brilliant. Yeah, I know, I saw. I think she just needs someone to give her a shot. I think Laycee could be just the person. - About earlier... - About what you said... - I, uh... - List... uh... - Um. - You go. I know I don't technically need a fake boyfriend anymore, but, um, I really care about this place and I would very much like to finish what we started. That is, of course, if you want to. Of course I do. Okay, first, the florist. Mm-mm. I have something better. Come with me. ♪ It's real love ♪ ♪ 'Cause we have enough ♪ Noah, slow down! ♪ It's real love ♪ ♪ 'Cause you love me the right way ♪ Whoa. What is this place? We call this the Falls. It's where the lake begins. ♪ It's real love ♪ ♪ 'Cause you love me the right way ♪ Here we are. Take whatever you want. - Seriously? - Of course. Mimi would be honored that her flowers are being used for such a special occasion. Thank you. Oh, and green. My favorite color. What's yours? Lavender. Noted, for our fake anniversary. And the snoring. I'm so happy, my mom's gonna love these. Any time. Now I recall you mentioning you're a photographer. As you know, we need one for the vow renewal ceremony. Oh no, it's just a hobby really, I'm not very good. Okay, how about you let me be the judge of that? I can't believe you took these. Aw. Noah, wait, these are beautiful. These should be hanging up around the B&B, - not hidden back here. - Nah. Feels a little self-indulgent. How so? People don't come here to see pictures of our family. Maybe. Maybe not. Putting these up could help people feel more like the family. It'd make them feel at home. I think we should, we still got time before Penny arrives. Well, good luck with that. Old Mr. Kennith only cranks the print press - every other Wednesday. - Oh. I've been waiting on my new menus since Christmas. Oh, I love this one. That's the first picture I took with a real camera. Okay. After careful consideration... Noah, would you please be the photographer of my parents' vow renewal? I would love that. I would, too. Whoa, it's my boss, um, I should take this. Um, thank you for today. - Melody, hi. - Why are you not - answering your phone? - I, um... - You missed a deadline. - For what? The press packet hits news outlets today - and the EPK is not ready. - Melody, I am so sorry, I... If you ever wanna make partner, we cannot have mistakes like this happening. I can assure you, it will not happen again. I need you back in the office first thing Monday morning. But my parents' vow renewal is on Monday. Missing deadlines is not on-brand, Rory. Making mistakes is not on-brand. - Melody. - I will not have you compromise - everything we've worked for... - Melody, ah, yeah, the Wi-Fi seems to be really playing up. I can't hear you at all, yeah, no. I'm gonna let you go now, okay, bye-bye, take care. Rory! These are gorgeous. Where did you find them? Noah's grandparents actually helped us out. The Falls? How'd you know about that? First time I kissed your father was at the Falls. Ooh. I, uh, almost fell in, but, it was so worth it. What's up, buttercup? There is a chance I need to head back to the city first thing Monday morning. - I'm sorry, Mum - The ceremony. Honey, if you can't be at the vow renewal on Monday because you've gotta get back to the city, your father and I will absolutely understand. I am so proud of you, and I know you've worked so hard, and this has been a big dream of yours for a long time. I love this dress on you. Thank you. It feels like the real you. There might be something I need to tell you about Noah. He's not your real boyfriend. You knew? Come on, I'm your mom. - Good point. - I mean... - Great choice though. - Thank you. Perfect jawline to make Jason jealous. That is totally what I was thinking. He's so chiseled and gorgeous, right? And so tall. Wait, but was it really that obvious? Only to me. So, don't mention this to your father. - He absolutely loves him. - Oh, dear. He's kind of planned a fishing trip with him and Noah in the summer. Of course he has. Yup. I love you, Mom. I love you too. It's getting late. I can finish this up on my own. I also might have something I need to do. Are you sure the blindfold is necessary? - Yes. Shh. - Okay, I trust you. Good, good, you should. - I think. - Stop, stop. Okay. Ready? I think so. Wow. This is... How did you... It turns out Old Kenny at the printing press had never met a Rory Richards before. I love it. I, uh, thought it would be nice to add a touch of Mimi. - Her recipes. - Mm-hm. And if you will follow me... There's more? Oh yeah, there's more. In here, you will see there is a touch of Stan. Rory, it's... Absolutely perfect and Penny Traverse is gonna love it. Is that... Also might have fixed your bell. You are incredible. I'm Rory Richards. I know this may have started as a fake relationship, but... For me, it's become... a very real... Friendship. I better get that. Hi, hello. You must be Penny. And you are? I'm Noah Bardon, the grandson of the founders of the B&B. Splendid. Can I give you the tour? Very well. Right this way. Hey. Hi. - You look nice. - Oh, thank you. Uh, hey, I know you're with Noah now, - but I was... - Actually, um... We're just friends. Oh. Well, great, 'cause I was wondering if we could chat later. Maybe over a glass of wine? Yeah, that sounds great. Great. Yeah, I look forward to it. Nice shot. Thank you. What's this I hear you're heading back to the city - first thing in the morning? - Mom! I said there is a possibility I might have to go back to the office. How'd it go? She loved it. Said she couldn't wait to write about it. - Yay! - I think we may have just saved this place. Thank you, Rory. I couldn't have done this without you. I'm just doing my job. Speaking of which, I actually put together a press kit for local publications. We've had a few bites already, including the Local Gazette. Are you serious? Rory! Oh! Oh! We should totally celebrate over dinner tonight. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, uh, just gotta grab a quick drink with Jason first. Oh? Well, yeah, he invited me. And you said yes? But what about you two? Oh, well, the thing... We're, uh... Um, basically, the thing with... I set it up. I figured we'd still got some things to talk about. Well, I should get ready. Congratulations again. I'm not gonna lie, I don't get why you're doing this. Because I need closure from Jason. There's no such thing as closure from someone else. Yes, there is. Closure is a thing you give yourself. Where'd you get that, in a self-help book? Yes, I did, actually. I support you, always, always. I just... I don't get why you're going back to Jason when you have a guy like Noah right in front of you. Because what I have with Noah isn't real. Has he told you that? No. But he told me that a fake girlfriend is enough for him. And less than an hour ago, he said that we are just friends. His words, not mine. Please zip me. That's because he thinks you still have feelings for Jason. But do you? - It's true, it's true. - I still have the pink bear you got me. It's there in the corner of my room. - No? - Yes. But you never got me anything, so I never had anything to keep. Guilty. Aw. Isn't this place special? Doesn't seem like your kind of place. It's not a bad thing. It's actually one of the things I like about you. You have a high society vibe. Rory. I think I made a mistake. I know, I wasn't always the best boyfriend to you, but... I'm sorry. You deserve so much better than that. And I promise I will be better if you give me another shot. I can give you what you want, for real this time. What do you think I want? A nice house, lots of travel, a new car. No. No, Jason, that is totally not what I want. I think we... we liked the idea of each other more than we actually liked each other, you know? I feel like I had this vision of what my life should look like, and I don't know if that's the real me. Jason, I want someone who I can count on, someone who I can build something with, someone... Someone who feels like home. I'm not sure I know what that even means. You will. If you slow down long enough to figure out what you really want. I hope you do that. You so deserve it. So does this mean... Ah. I like this Rory. Thank you. I like her too. It really was good seeing you. Oh, come here, give me a hug. Noah? Noah? Noah, there's something I wanna tell you. Melody, hi. What is going on, Rory? What are you talking about? The Penny Traverse article. This little Lily Lake Bed and Breakfast - isn't a client of ours... - I know that. I was... I wasn't doing it under the Extend umbrella. You have a contract with us, Rory, and this goes against that. Yes, I know, I can explain. You've been neglecting work, missing deadlines, you took a vacation during our busiest season, and now you've taken on a client behind my back. I was just trying to help a friend. I cannot have someone working for me who doesn't respect what I'm doing. Melody, please. You are here in this office tomorrow or your time with Extend is over. Extend PR, a hotshot firm owned by Melody Remington, took on the small B&B as a client and led their rebrand. Noah! Yes, we do have one more room available that night. Thank you, we'll see you then. Lily Lake B&B, this is Noah. Oh, you would. I'm so sorry, but we are completely booked out that weekend. Yes, the following weekend we have one room left. Okay, great. Yes, I'm also a fan of Penny Traverse. Okay, bye. How could you do this to me? - What now? - You told Penny that Extend was behind your PR. - You were. - No, Noah. I was behind it, not Extend. I'm sorry, I didn't think that... That's the problem. You didn't think. That article needs to come down. What are you talking about? This is the busiest we've ever been. That's great, but nobody fact-checked with me. What you said is about to cost me my job. You hate your job. You said so yourself. You want to be working for clients that you care about. Well, do you know what, you're good enough to do that if you would only believe in yourself. He's a little busy right now fighting with his fake girlfriend. He's gonna have to call you back. I do believe in myself. No, you don't. You're back with a guy who dumped you without a second thought. You're working for a company who doesn't appreciate you. And you're halfway up a corporate ladder you don't even want to climb. You have no idea what you're talking about. I know you better than you think. Says my fake boyfriend. Fake. I didn't ask for any of this. You're right. We don't owe each other anything. Rory, wait. What? I'm sorry, Lily Lake B&B, this is Noah. Hey. Honey, we got your text. I thought you weren't leaving till tomorrow. No, but Melody is gonna fire me if I'm not in the office tomorrow. I can't say we're not sad. But we understand how hard you've worked for this, kiddo. Thank you, Dad. I just wish things would have worked out differently. Me too. We love you. I love you too. Rory? Rory. Rory! Make sure Noah gets lots of photos. Rory! Rory! Rory, wait!

It was great what you did, hiring a publicist. - What's her name? - Rory Richards of Richards Publicity. You must be Peter, it is so nice to meet you. I've heard so much about you. This is Cindy. I'm, here from the Lily Lake Gazette. She'd actually like to grab a quick comment from you. She's doing a feature about the best bed and breakfast in town. Okay, sure. Rory, what's going on? Noah, I was wrong. I completely overreacted. You had every right to tell Penny that I worked for Extend. I never told you not to. I am so sorry. No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry that I put your job at risk. I called Penny and I had her take the article down. And I, as your publicist, I had her put a new one up. "From my stay at Lily Lake Bed and Breakfast, I can tell you that nothing beats their homegrown hospitality. And I'll be the first in line for the return of their famous Lily Lake Festival. This place is a must-stay for any guest looking for a home away from home." "Now with wi-fi." I thought you'd like that. Rory, thank you so much. - Yeah, uh... - So, wait, hang on. Rory of Richards Publicity? - You quit your job? - I did, yes. And, uh, your Grandma Mimi... Sorry, the fairies, they might have had a little something to do with it. There are two moments in life. Those you miss... and those you seize. Noah, you were right. I was putting everything I had into a job that I hated. I want my life to be about so much more than that. I am so happy for you. Uh... So, um, yeah, I hope that everything went well with you and Jason. Yeah, it did. Good, good. I'm really so happy for you both. Oh, no, we're not... Jason is so not the guy for me. - He's not? - I wanna be with someone who sees the real me and loves me because of it. I think... I hope I found that in a guy that pretended to be my fake boyfriend. - Oh, that guy. - Mm-hm. - He's not so bad. - Oh, no. He's actually very handsome. - Oh, you think so? - I do. I mean, too bad it was all fake, right? For the record, I can tell you that it wasn't fake for him. Rory, I've spent my whole life in this place, but somehow it's being with you makes it feel...
