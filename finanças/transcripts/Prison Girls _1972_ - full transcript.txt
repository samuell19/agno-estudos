[Lion roars] [Mellow rock music] ♪ - God damn it. Gertie, do you have to be horny 24 hours a day? I got more important things on my mind like getting this shower to work. - If this were a box of candy, you'’d let me kiss you all over, wouldn'’t you, sweetie? - Gertie, the soap here is about as slimy as you are. - I'’d do anything for you, baby. [Water rushing] - [Gasps] Gertie, you fucking bitch! - [Laughs] - Shit. - Do you know what i'’m gonna do with this? - Soap. I never thought of that. New way to get your jollies. I'’ll have to ask Dr. Reinhart about that next time I let her know about my sex life. I'’ll be seeing her soon, you know? I'’m on her list of goodies. I'’m gonna get a weekend furlough. - Who are you kidding? I came here for a shower, not a snow job. - You quit your little numbers, or i'’m gonna wrap a towel around your neck. I'’m up for parole next month, and if you get a weekend pass and I Don'’t, i'’m gonna bust out of this goddamn place. - No butch lays their hands on me twice. - Well, I probably caught the clap from you from laying them on you once. - Okay, okay. Now, listen, Cindy, lay it on me straight. Is it just you getting the pass? - Well, not exactly. I heard from Alice who got it from Ginny who knows the file clerk at the warden'’s office... [Pounding] [Water rushing] That at least six of US will get a free weekend pass on Dr. Reinhart'’s say-so. - Big deal! Like I care. - Why Don'’t you fuck off? - Hey, girls, have you heard about the weekend passes? [All speaking at once] Down, girls, down. It'’s part of our rehabilitation. - Knock it off! This ain'’t playpen time. Come on. Clean, you hear? All right, i'’m not gonna hang around and wash your backsides. [Women squealing and laughing] - What are you in for, sweetie? - It'’s none of your damn business. Shit. - That'’s my shower. - Bet you get your own special brown toilet paper too. - Cool it, baby. We'’ve got weekend passes. - Slow and easy, sweetie. - Weekend passes. Ain'’t that nice. Be groovy visiting a sewer for a couple days, wouldn'’t it? - You fucking bitch! [Both grunting] - Stop it! - Get your hands off my towel, you bitch! - [Yells] - Oh, how dare you? - [Screaming] Get off! [All yelling indistinctly] - Let go of me! [All yelling indistinctly] - I'’m gonna drown you! - [Screams] - Bitch! Get out of here! - God damn you girls. - Get out of here! - Come on! Knock it off. [Women yelling indistinctly] Come on, you. All right, knock it off! Up! Stand up! Up! Everybody, up! Up! - [Sighs] No matter what I tried, Dr. Reinhart, I ended up being like an iceberg. Poor frank. He tried everything. He read books. We even went to a marriage counselor. And when he started going with that girl at work, that'’s when I started going crazy. That'’s when I started shoplifting and selling and... Drinking and taking downers. [Sighs] I'’m sorry. But even after all that, frank says he still loves me. - And you felt guilty because you were frigid and couldn'’t satisfy frank? Tell me, did you ever experience just one, one moment of ecstasy with your husband? - Maybe once... Almost. But you can hear everything in our apartment, and I heard footsteps clear down the hall, and I froze up. - There were two girls down the hall from you last year. They were very shy. Both of them tell me they hated sex. I guess they'’re what you'’d call inhibited. When they were released, a boyfriend of one of the girls called me, and we tried an experiment. - An experiment? - Before I got into prison work, I had a private practice. I helped this man who had nothing but money and a terrible sex life. Anyway, he'’s in the east now, and when he travels, he always leaves me the key to his apartment. I spent most of the day in the house with these four young people, discussing case histories that had worked and how, in their case, they probably could achieve a happier and more normal life by not following established morality. Then group nude touching sessions were held in a darkened room. After I left the house, they followed my advice to continue the nude touching sessions, but this time in the beautiful surroundings the home provided. Their aroused state would lead naturally to group sex. These two girls seeing each other'’s enjoyment of sexual foreplay began to overcome the strict morality forced on them since childhood. They were like children again, without a care in the world, and their problems seemed to almost melt away. A puritanical background is not the problem of most women prisoners. A woman prisoner thinks of herself as a reject, a failure, and feels that society doesn'’t want her. Some women have no one. To most of the girls in here, sex was a thing to be used for getting money or favors. They knew almost nothing about love. Inside these prison walls, they know even less. They turn to each other, not for love but for sex and comfort, and so their ability to feel love once they leave prison almost disappears. You see, if I can in any way help an inmate here toward a path where she can find some type of full sexual fulfillment in society, then I have, in a sense, helped save her. Some of these paths may be unusual or drastic, but so are shock treatments. There is a road, but each girl has to find her own way, and maybe I can suggest something to them. At least, I can listen. That'’s why I've told you about these two girls. They shared an experience. - Isn'’t that beautiful? - That'’s a nice bird. - It'’s a golden pheasant from India. I really love it. Beautiful colors. [Moaning and smooching] Want to go to the passion pits? - Yeah, why Don'’t we go over there now? - All right. - Hold on. - Okay. - Ah. - Look at this place. - Far out. - It'’s beautiful. - Oh. - Oh. - Ah. - Mmm. [All moaning] - Go again. What is this? - Me. - [Chuckles] [Sultry saxophone music] ♪ - Communal love, sharing happiness, worked for them, and I have an idea about you. - Oh, i'’ll do anything. - Why Don'’t you and your frank borrow the apartment? No one will bother you. There'’ll be no people down the hall. It'’ll be a second honeymoon. It might take a little time, but you can let it happen. - Dr. Reinhart, i'’ll try. I can'’t thank you... [Chuckles] I mean-- - please, it'’s all right. After all, if it works, I can write about it in my book. - Thank you. - Now, get back to your work. I have to take care of this weekend pass business for the six of you. [Knock at door] - Vivian, may I see you a minute? - Of course, Jack. - Thank you, Dr. Reinhart. - What'’s on your mind, Jack? Cigarette? - [Sighs] Remember Johnny bricker? When those six women who are getting the weekend pass were sent up here about a year ago, he tried to hijack the bus. One of them is his girlfriend. I never mentioned it to you, I guess. Well, he just shot a bank guard. They identified him. [Phone rings] - Yes? Yes, he'’s here. It'’s melba. - I can hear her from here. Yes, melba, what is it? Where were you? Send '’em over here to Dr. Reinhart'’s office. I'’ll see 'em here. Yes, melba. I rest easy when I know you'’re on the job. Bye. Cindy, Joyce, Toni, gertie, right? Model prisoners. They got into a water fight in a shower room and soaked melba. - This isn'’t going to make a difference, is it? - No. - They should get their passes. - All those girls were on the bus, and when they leave here, they'’re gonna be tailed. One of '’em could lead US to Johnny bricker. - None of them has mentioned Johnny. But if you think it'’s best, i'’d concentrate on Cindy and Toni. They'’ve told me the least about their relationships with their men. - Well, how did it start? - These here mermaids soaked me all over. - Thank you, melba. You realize, of course, I could enter this into your records? - [Sighs] - I'’d like to hear your side of the story, gertie. - Those new ones are smart-asses. - Hmm. Joyce. - They got my towel all wet. - You Don'’t say. I bet it was a catastrophe. Toni. - There it was. I didn'’t know what was going on. - I tried to stop them. - All right, all right. Sit down. I'’ve been in this business long enough to know you knew about it before I did. The four of you were up for weekend passes. Now, Dr. Reinhart believes, and I agree, that a weekend would be the greatest thing to rehabilitate you to civilian life. Okay. I'’m not gonna penalize you this time. - Oh, man. - You get the passes. Okay, Vivian, you take over. I'’ll talk to you later. [All squealing and laughing] - Simmer down, girls. Girls, i'’d appreciate a little attention. I want you to use these two days. It'’s the first opening of the doorway when you'’re finally released, and the transition will not be so painful. That'’s all, girls. [All speaking at once] - Oh, thank you. - And no more shower fights! Send in Kay rivers. Hi, Kay. I guess you'’ve heard the good news about the weekend passes. - Yeah, i'’ve heard. - Let'’s see. Yes. Last time, you were explaining that Mike became your pimp after you lived with him for two months. Will you be seeing him on your furlough? - Well, I Don'’t want to. Bastard. But my clothes are all at his place. Um, i'’m just gonna get them and clear out. He picked me up right after I got out of college. Couldn'’t get a job, right? Oh, he knew all about it. I was so hooked on that bastard. You could have at least changed the lock. - Hi, honey. You want to watch? - Hello, Kay. I could have picked you up, but you didn'’t even let me know you were getting out. - Are you Kay? Mike said you could give me lessons. - Get your ass out of here. I have something to say to this pig. - Hey, Don'’t be mad at me. You were here first. I'’ll take the leavings. And by the way, my name is sugar. - Don'’t you smile at me, you son of a bitch. Because you didn'’t pay off that cop, they threw the book at me. And where was the lawyer? And where were you on visiting days, huh? Oh, boy, you are a bastard. - You'’re lookin' good, Kay. Look, you'’re out. Forget it, huh? I didn'’t have the money, baby. I felt bad, real bad for a long time. - Oh, no, you Don'’t. - Oh, I like you. You still got a temper. I like you real fine. Could you do everything like you just walked off a yacht instead of a-- - Mike, i'’m on a furlough two days because i'’ve been a model prisoner. Two days to start getting my life in order so that I can be ahead of the game when I get out. Mike, i'’m starting with you! - How are things at Santa Helena'’s, honey? A friend of mine was in there for three months, and she said it was a real butt twitcher. - You'’re wearing my clothes! Let go of me. Take them off, or i'’ll take them off of you! - Sugar. - But I love this outfit. Listen, i'’ll pay you for it. Mike said I could take anything I wanted. I'’ll give you half of my first trick, okay? Okay, baby, i'’m gone. - I'’m glad you understand, Mike. I mean, the past two years, what did I get? I got about $5,000 worth of clothes, and I got it by balling everything that walked past me. I'’d have been rich if I hadn'’t given most of it to you. - Yoo-hoo! Mike! Oh, I got a real feeble freak that gave me $100. You want me back later? - Nah, stick around. Kay, this is Philly. - Philly to my friends. Phyllis to my tricks. You want to see my teeth too? - That'’s mine. I bought it over a year ago, and I never even wore it. I paid $150 for it! - You may want it, but I got it. Mike, who is this creep? - Creep? While i'’ve been serving time, this guy has been passing around all my clothes! - Philly, baby, what'’s a little jumpsuit between me and you? - It'’s a lot. - Take it off. - Mike. - Give it to her. - No! - Philly, baby, what'’s a little jumpsuit? - That'’s what you said when you gave it to me. - I Don'’t exactly remember what I said then, but I do know what I want now. Do you understand? - Look, she comes sucking around here, and i'’m supposed to roll over and play dead? - That'’s an idea. Let'’s start with your face. Plastic surgery maybe will cost you about $1,000. - Okay, Mike, okay. [Sighs] Bastard! - Now, let'’s get it straight, baby. You were in the joint. You met some dykes. So now you want a man around to take care of you. - You can'’t imagine me cutting you off unless there'’s somebody else. Look, Mike, I just want out. That'’s all. No dykes. No tricks. No lovers. I'’ve been a model prisoner. - Just go out hackin'’ by yourself? - You'’ve got sugar and Philly. - That'’s right, baby. Who needs you? Those two can rack balls so fast it'’d make your head swim. - You mean those little bitches? Ah! - You got a shitty mouth, baby. - [Gasping] [Blows landing] [Groaning] - Mike, stop it. Stop it! - You get the fuck out, Philly! - Sure, Mike. Anything you say. - Oh. [Screaming] - Not bad, baby. Just a little bit more sag. Okay, baby. You know what to do. [Slow instrumental music] ♪ - Oh, Mike, i'’ve missed you so much. - I missed you too, baby. - Why didn'’t you ever write or come visit me? - '’cause I couldn't stand to see you and not feel you like this. - Oh, Mike, I love you. Oh, Mike, do it. Do it right now. [Moans] [Breathing heavily] Oh, yes. [Moans softly] [Breathing heavily] Oh, Mike. Oh, Mike. Oh, Mike. [Moans] [Both breathing heavily] Oh. - Wow. When Dr. Reinhart suggested a change of environment, she really meant a change. I had been sitting in Dr. Reinhart'’s office when the shower fight started, so it wasn'’t a question of losing my two-day furlough. It was a question of whether or not I could overcome the sexual frustration which had turned me into a thief and a drug addict. The conditions were perfect. A quiet house, a visit to a beauty parlor, a long and lovely lunch with lots of wine, and a husband who still loved me. I felt and looked like a new woman. - You worried, honey? - Nervous. [Chuckles] Do you think those things the doctor suggested will help get me going? - Sweetheart, a one-sided sex life may be okay for a while, but sooner or later, you'’re gonna resent me. - Oh, I Don'’t think so. - I Don'’t know if it'’s something I do or something I Don'’t do, or maybe it'’s your puritanical upbringing. - [Laughs] That'’s not it. [Sighs] This place is like a palace. - This night'’s gonna be an adventure for both of US. And maybe if I can bring you to a climax, we'’ll both start enjoying our sex lives more. - I hope so. - Come on. Let'’s pop the cork. - I was following Dr. Reinhart'’s advice, advice based on the theory that the solution to my problem of reaching normal sexual fulfillment was simply quiet surroundings and a proper frame of mind, and, of course, after two years without a man, I was sexually ready, and my husband, frank, could hardly wait. All the conditions were perfect. You horny, young stud, aren'’t you getting a little fresh? - Fresh? Before the night is done, i'’m gonna get damn right sexy. - If you can learn to unbutton my dress. [Laughs] How about some of that champagne? - Okay, you think it'’ll loosen you up? - It might. I wish I could enjoy sex as much as you do. You enjoy it so much, and to me, it'’s... It'’s just like another duty. I bet if I could enjoy an orgasm just once, I could learn to look forward to enjoying it. And i'’d want to do it every time you do. - You will. Pop! - [Screams] [Laughs] Oh, no. It'’s gonna drip. - Here. - Not bad for an amateur. - An amateur, huh? - Mmm. [Smacks lips] Very good. [Sighs] Wait a minute. Are you sure we'’re all alone in here? I mean, it'’s such a big house. - The doctor said we were gonna be alone, didn'’t he? Having trouble with that? - Yes. You do it. [Chuckles] [Giggles] - Your buttons first. - Well, why me first all the time? - '’cause I like to look at you. I hope you feel better. - Mm. [Laughs] Mm, I am slightly stoned. - Already? - Yes. - Doesn'’t take you much, does it? - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. [Giggles] - You'’re so beautiful. - I'’m gonna play on the swing. [Laughs] [Sensual blues music] ♪ [Laughs] ♪ Oh! [Laughs] I just Don'’t get turned on as easy as you do.

It was warm and went to my toes, and it went everywhere. [Laughing] Let'’s go take a shower. [Laughs] [Laughs] I love you. Thanks for being so patient with me. - [Sighs] - [Laughs] - All right. [Both laugh] - Got you now. - Hey. [Chuckles] It'’s not nice for girls to be so aggressive. - Oh, come on. Can'’t you do it again? - Uh... [Both laugh] - Come on. - Just give me a little time. Come on. - Come on. - Come on. That'’s a little quick. Just relax a little bit. - Oh, oh. - Let'’s sit by the fire and just.. - Oh. - Watch the fire. - Oh. [Laughs] Okay.

Want some coffee? - Please. - I love you. - I love you. - Oh, I never realized how wonderful our marriage could be. Dr. Reinhart'’s right. Women with inhibitions should solve their problems. We did. - I--i thought I loved my husband when I married him. My parents liked him. I guess they were happy to get me out of the house. Eight kids in the family. I mean, can you imagine? It was great till we got married. Then I had an abortion... Hello? And I was sick, and then he lost his job. Hello? He was so mean. I didn'’t mean to kill him. Yes, I did. I used to dream about it. [Clattering] Hello? Hello? - Yeah? - Hi, Ken. - Hello, Joyce. - [Chuckles] Didn'’t mean to surprise you like that. - I guess they let you out. - No. Just a two-day furlough. Still have two months left to go. - Would you like to sit down? Sorry this is the only thing to sit on, except maybe the back of a car. - That'’s okay. Listen. I thought i'’d come here to thank you. - My brother didn'’t do right by you. I remember some of the things that... I remember. - Me too. - Uh, I could run down the street and get a cup of coffee or a beer or something. - No, Don'’t bother, Ken. That'’s awfully sweet of you, though. Do you realize it'’s been almost three years? - [Sighs] That long, huh? Would you like some grass? - Okay. - You know, I could never figure out how-- how my brother could treat a pretty girl like you the way he did. You look the same, Joyce. - Somebody likes me. My family never bothered to write or visit me. Why didn'’t you visit? - I--i didn'’t think I ought to. You know, he was good to me sometimes. He really was. Well, part of me wanted to. I thought if I cleared up some of his leavings it would ease your mind. - That'’s what I came here to thank you about. [Engines revving] - It'’s just some of my friends. [Engines revving] - Hey, Ken, you old fart. [Chuckles] How you been? - Fine. - Ken, I think i'’ll be going now. - No, if you'’re Ken's old lady, stick around. - Hawk, she was just visiting. - I'’d like to at least get her name. - Hawk, meet Joyce. This is my sister-in-law. - Ken, you scumbag. This is Joyce? [Chuckles] Your brother'’s wife? [Laughs] Excuse me. Widow. - [Sniffs] - Hey, hey, knock it off. Got something here that will really turn you on. This here is Joyce. She'’s really something else. - Ken, i'’m leaving. - Hawk, she just-- she just dropped by. - Hey, Ken, I know you. You want US to shag ass so you could rag her up, '’cause you had your eyes set on her, didn'’t you? [Chuckles] I'’ll fix you up.

Take a tram ride? - Oh, I had a few rides, but not on the tram. Come on, Freddie. - What'’s the rush? You'’ve got all day. To think I gave up painting for you. So how'’d you like the desert? - Was kind of hard to see it through the bedroom window. - [Laughs] No golfing, then, huh? - Oh, just the balls, Freddie, no clubs. - [Chuckles] - [Breathing heavily] - Mm. - [Whispers] Freddie. [Both moan] Oh, Freddie. - Yeah. That'’s what I like. - Then that'’s what you got. - Mm. God, you feel good. - Thanks. - [Moans] [Sighs] Mm. - [Whispers] Faster. - Mm. [Both breathing heavily] Oh. - Freddie, it'’s been so long. [Both breathing heavily] - I knew you'’d be back. - [Moans] - Oh, god. - [Moans] Baby. [Both moaning] So nice. - Oh. - Oh. - Oh. - Mm. [Both breathing heavily] - Mm. - Freddie. I spent a lot of time with this man, uh, Gary. He'’s really a love. Yeah. He'’s supposed to own half of palm Springs, or at least he acts like it. [Doorbell buzzes] Are you expecting anyone? [Doorbell buzzes] - Get your fucking finger off that buzzer, you chicken head! Hey! Get the hell out of here! - Gertie, get the hell out of here. - I followed you here. I'’ve been waiting for hours, but you didn'’t come out, and I couldn'’t stand it any longer. - Freddie, throw her out! - I'’ve got a few muscles, but I haven'’t got that many. I'’ll call the police. - If you put a hand on that phone, i'’ll pulverize you. - Got some high-class friends, Toni. - Gertie, i'’ll never forgive you for this. I'’m sorry. - You little cunt. You couldn'’t wait to get out to get yourself some big fat-assed man. Who do you think took care of you for the last six months, and what do you think I did to get all those cigarettes and candies for you? - Been in palm Springs lately? Your name, uh, your last name, Gary. Maybe your first name? - Bastard, you sure ask too many questions. - Hey, what'’s the story? - [Sighs] Okay. No palm Springs. Santa Helena women'’s correctional facility. That'’s my cell mate, my roomie. She'’s got the charm of an ice pick. - [Laughs] - Gertie, give me those things. You know, you'’re really stupid. If anybody found you with those on a two-day furlough... Give '’em to me, gertie. Gertie, come on. Jerk. - Well, I have to admit. I feel a little easier about the whole thing. You know, Toni, you'’re the best ball I ever had, but you'’re also the biggest put-on. - Get dressed, Toni. Let'’s split. - I Don'’t want to see that dumb face of yours. Freddie, get rid of her. - I know a couple of karate chops, and I can put out your eyes quicker than you can blink '’em. - I never hit women or men, for that matter. - Toni belongs to me, and I Don'’t like anyone putting a hand on her. - You make me sick. I Don'’t belong to you. - She one of the tram rides you had in palm Springs? - You butt out of this, or i'’ll strip the hide off your cherry picker. - They already did it when I was eight days old. - I said get dressed. - You get the hell out of here! I'’m sick of you. - I'’ll count to ten. - Nobody tells me what to do, least of all you. Gertie, you fucking bitch. - I want you to come with me. I want you with me. [Smacking] - Freddie, help! - I want you to come with me, you understand? - [Groans] Oh. - You whore, you! - [Gasps] Gertie! Damn you! - Oh, baby, I didn'’t mean to. - Don'’t touch me! - I didn'’t mean to hurt you. - Sure. You'’re a shit. Oh, gertie, i'’m tired. - Let'’s go. - [Sighs] There'’s no place to go. - Stay here. - Here? - Yeah. Oh, gertie, i'’m sorry. I didn'’t mean anything I said. - Oh, baby. - [Moans softly] - Can a man join this party? - It'’s okay, gertie. He'’s cool. [Sensual blues music] ♪ - I didn'’t know you were kinky. I dig kinky girls. I'’m gonna be so good to you and gertie. [Moans softly] [Sensual blues music] ♪ [Tap on door] - I Don'’t believe it! - Johnny. - Oh, baby. Oh, baby. - It'’s real. I'’m here. Johnny, what'’s that? - It'’s a gun. I forgot about it for a second. It bothers you, doesn'’t it? Okay, i'’ll take it off. - [Quietly] Thanks. - How did you get out so soon? You must have been a model prisoner or something. I'’ll bet you were the most beautiful. I'’ll lay odds to that. Baby, you look great. Look at you. Oh, wow. Oh, baby, i'’ve got to get my head together. This changes all my plans. - I only have two days. Well, less than a day now. I'’ve got to get back tonight. - What do you mean? - Well, you see they have these rehabilitations in going. Two-days furlough so we go back out and see how things are, and I spent most of yesterday looking for you. - Were you followed? - Johnny, what have you been up to? - Nothin'’. I was on a job, and it didn'’t work out. Oh, baby. Oh, baby. You look great. Won'’t you give me a little look? - Mm-hmm. - Oh, I miss that. Ooh. You wore the lace ones. You know how I like the lace ones, Don'’t you? - Oh, Johnny. I'’ve missed you so much. - Oh, you look beautiful, baby. [Whispers] Oh, baby, I missed you. [Sultry jazz music] ♪ - You know what i'’ve been dreaming about? - What have you been dreaming about, baby? - Your hands. All you'’ve got to do is touch me. Mm. [Both breathing heavily] Darling, we'’ve got so little time. - I tried to get you off the bus, baby, but the guard was a little too quick for me. - That was dumb, Johnny, but I was so proud. They asked US questions. "Do any one of you know who that man was?" And I felt warm all over. "No," I said, and inside I kept saying, "Johnny loves me. Johnny loves me." - Mm, you still have that big beautiful mole. When did you get such a sexy mole like that, huh? - I planted it just for you. Johnny, why did you ask me if I was followed? - Well, I tried to withdraw some money from the bank, and they gave me a little static, so I plugged him in the gut. - They'’re looking for you. - Well, they Don'’t know I'm here. Nobody knows i'’m here except you. And, besides, i'’ve got all the bread in the world. We can go anywhere we want to go. - I want to go to Hawaii. That'’s where I want to go. - Ole! [Laughs] Yeah. Oh. You'’re too much. I'’m gonna make the reservations right now. How about it? - Darling, i'’d love to, but i'’ve got to go back. - You'’re kidding. You'’re out. Stay out. [Sultry jazz music] ♪ Yeah. Oh. You'’re too much. I'’m gonna make the reservations right now. How about it? - Darling, i'’d love to, but i'’ve got to go back. - You'’re kidding. You'’re out. Stay out. - I can'’t, really. - Baby, I risked my neck to get you out of that place. Now, if you'’ve got something going for you, you'’ve got to level with me. - Look, if I Don'’t go back, i'’ll have to serve out my full term. That'’s another year at least. - And what about me? I stick around and wait. Maybe you get out. Maybe you Don'’t. And every time I want to go out, I have to put on a fucking disguise. I'’m getting sick of this shit. - It'’ll only be a couple of months, three at the most, and then i'’ll go with you wherever you want. - Baby, if you go back to that place, you'’re gonna blow it. [Sighs] I'’m telling you, Cindy, I love you very much, but i'’m gonna split. Do you understand? What we'’ve got is so much more important than any one of their goddamn rules. This furlough shit. What kind of crap is that anyway? - If I Don'’t go back, they might never do this again. They might not trust the other girls. - Baby, what in the hell has happened to you? When I met you, I said, "this is it." You were smart. You were tough. You were honest. You knew what you wanted. So you get ripped off, and you'’re acting just like all the other scared little chicks. - I Don'’t have a passport. - I'’ll get you one. We'’ll fly to Miami, and i'’ll get me one too, and then we'’ll kiss this fucking place off. They Don'’t need US, and we Don'’t need them, baby. It'’s all right, baby. It'’s all in here. You'’re gonna eat the biggest steaks in Miami, in South America. - Johnny, i'’m scared. Tell me not to be scared. - Oh, baby, that'’s okay. We'’ll be together. Trust me, baby. - That'’s all that matters. - Mm. Mm. Ah. [Sighs] Ah. [Both breathing heavily] - Johnny, i'’ve never met a man like you. Every time is just like the first time. - Johnny bricker! This place is surrounded. Come out with your hands up! Come out, or we'’ll come in! - Johnny, Don'’t, please. Don'’t make it worse! - Worse? How could it be any worse? - Johnny, give yourself up. I'’ve waited for you before. You wait for me. - I'’ve been hiding in this place for two months. You got them here, didn'’t you? - No, I didn'’t. I swear I didn'’t. - You sent them up, you bitch. - Johnny-- - get off! [Glass shatters] - We'’ve got a search warrant. You come out, or we come in. [Gunshots] - I'’m getting the fuck out of here. - No, Johnny, Don'’t. I won'’t let you go. - Come on, baby. Sweetie, come with me, please. Please, come with me. Let go of me, Cindy.

[Gunshot] [Gunshots] [Gunshot] - All your files in order, doctor? [Door clicks shut] - Kay, girls, I didn'’t hear you come in. - Well, we didn'’t bother to knock since this ain'’t a social call. - I Don'’t understand. What'’s the matter? - We'’re talking about your so-called rehabilitation weekend and all the goddamn good it did for US. - If you'’re talking about Joyce, i'’m sorry, but the hospital has assured me she'’ll be all right. - We'’re not talking about what happened to Joyce. She just got a rough break like a lot of the rest of US, but she'’ll pull through, and she'’ll get over it. - We'’re talking about Cindy, and we know why she didn'’t show up here today. We also know that it was no accident about that cop finding out about Johnny'’s hideaway this particular weekend. - That'’s about enough! - Give me that phone. You bitch! What you did to Cindy! You bastard! You bastard! - Gertie, get off of her! Get off! You want to spend some more time? - Knock it off! Knock it off! I'’m sorry. I didn'’t know they were here. - It'’s all right, melba. The girls and I were just having a little talk, but I believe it'’s about over. - Okay, move out. - Kay, i'’m sorry that you and the other girls feel as you do, but there'’s one thing I think you'’ve forgotten. When you walk through those gates, you are no longer an individual. You have no freedom of choice. You'’re in prison, and all decisions have to be made within that system. We have no freedom of choice. No matter how any of US feel, none of US can make a single decision unless it'’s within that system. None of US can survive outside of its laws. I'’m sorry about Cindy, but she was in prison for associating with a criminal, and she died because of that association. I did what I did because it was the right thing to do. I hope you understand. - Yes, I understand, doctor. And I also understand that within three short months, i'’ll be on the outside as an individual, and i'’ll be free. But, doctor, where will you be six months from now? Or six years? You'’ll still be behind that same desk or another one just like it, and with you at that desk will be the memory of Cindy and what you did to her with your so-called system. But tell me, Dr. Reinhart, which one of US will be in prison then? [Electrifying rock music] [Lion roars]
