This song's so cool. It reminds me of Paul, in summer 3 years ago. Why? Chjara and Stella were getting ready in the bathroom and we were singing it. You all right, kids? So, did you eat the cucumber tart? I didn't have time. Eat it soon, or else your balls will drop off. Rubbish. I've got ram's bollocks. Seriously. Be careful. Pack in that ruckus with your scooter at night. - It's not us. - It's not you? Do you think I'm stupid? I don't want to hear it again. I'll shoot your tyres next time. Precisely. What's in your bag? Drugs? An Aries scratch card. That's my heart sign. And a Cancer one too. It's the only one I hadn't got. Darling, we're going to eat at Noel's. I've left you a courgette gratin in the fridge. Yeah, all right. - What are you doing after? - Dunno. Come and watch the Tour de France with me. - Watch it on your own. - No thanks. Go on. I've got orange pop. We said no, Jeannot. Leave it, Lisandru. I've got brandy too. Piss off, Jeannot! I'll go and pick my sloes, then. They're my sloes. Don't touch them. Got it? I can smurf. So fuck you! I'll burn this village, and everyone in it. Nutcase. What's up with him? Not all the nutters are locked up. He's sick in the head. He's a spastic. If she wants to be excellent, she should try it. I'll think about it. Let me know, I'll talk to him. A friendly word of advice, though. If you put her with Marc-Andre, get her to lose some weight. She won't get through the auditions like that. That's all the sweets she eats. Did you hear, Francesca? If you want to go to Victoire's dance school, you must stop the sweets. Victoire doesn't eat any. Sweets is one thing. She has to practise too. Victoire works hard. She does an hour of afro-jazz every day at home. You can really see the difference. Victoire stands out from the others, on stage. Anywayâ€¦ I sing you a little song To take you around the world A song with two little words That speak of freedom Freedom for the flower that blooms Freedom for the bird that flies And for the river that flows Freedom I sing you a little song To take you around the world A song with two little words That speak of freedom Freedom for the goat on high Freedom for the sea below Freedom for Humanity Freedom Amandine. - How are you? - Good. - You here for the season, Greg? - Yeah, I'm fired up! That's cool. What's new with you? I'm keeping busy. Cool. Have you seen my brother? He's over there. I hadn't seen him. He's pretty transparent right now. Give him a break, poor thing. It's okay. He'll find someone else. That's life. Yeah. - See you later, then? - Later. Later. Lucienne! Everything in order? Hello Vero. How are you? Well, I'm doing my best. Got no choice, have you? You can't change things. That's the way it is. Look at him. He's off his rocker. What happens if a child crosses? Chest and nob. You're mental. And you're better with your hairy nob? Women like when it's clean. It's more hygienic. Ask Amandine. - That depends which women. - That's sure. Look at what you pick up. They're a right load of dogs. Hair or no hair, throw them a stick, they'll grab it. Nice trainers! How much were they? 110. - Nice shoes you've got. - Don't buy the same, Barabbas. On the other hand, your trousers... Tell me something, Franje. I saw Jean's son's car. Nice car. Your dad didn't give us stuff when we passed our exams. What exams, Bastien? You never even went to school. So an NVQ in plumbing is crap? Plumbers make a bomb these days. You make a mint. I might spend my birthday in Thailand. What do you reckon? So go. We could all go. We'd have a good time. You'll pay for the plane, right? As you're being a smart arse, I won't pay for the plane. But I'll pay for everything there. And I'll set up a blow job championship. A blow job championship? You take 32 birds. Make pools, mark them, Champions League style. The best suckers go through to a round of 16, quarter finals and so on. - You're vile. - You only get one life. Enjoy it. Get your dicks sucked. Piss off, you. It closes at 8. I have a lust for life. Believe me, I've been depressed since I got out of prison. I feel even more depressed when I see you like this. Give over. Your relationship won't be strong if you keep seeing other people. It won't work out, Anna-Maria. I don't mean messing around. When you've been together a long time, you can accept once. It's not the end of the world. It's a change in routine. What? It's a change in routine? I don't want to hear that. I can't believe what I'm hearing. You must be off your head. I'd never want to be unfaithful because I'd be with someone who'd satisfy me. I'd love him enough to have just him. I don't mean 20 times, just once. No, I don't share. I don't share. That's not love. That's possession. No. It's a stable relationship. But you don't know what that means. Just drop it. I'm starving. - Do you want to eat? - Yes. Two classics. - Now? - Yes, please. Two classics, Paul. - What's up? - What? What are you looking at? - Look at that. - What? We've even got ants here. It's a bloody pain. There's nothing for it. I bought some Eradicator powder. You know, the big white pot. The more you kill, the more there are. Products are pointless, Hyacinthe. They're just money makers. It's more likely to kill you than the ants. I'm not kidding. With those ants, when you kill a colony, the queen absorbs the information and lays double what you killed. It's endless. It's a horror film. - Put the cornets on my dad's tab. - Okay. The only thing you can do is keep them away. You know what I did at home? It was totally infested. I put concrete everywhere. They went off to the neighbour's. That's all you can do. It's war. Wherever he goes, he fights. We go to Bastelica, he fights. To Ocana, he fights. Ajaccio, he fights. He just needs to control himself. Is it coming out? Oh, it's full of blood! It's disgusting. There's blood in our mouths. Yuk. - Here. - No! No kidding. I told him. Get the Golf with all the options, it's cheaper. Yeah. Yeah. There you go. He'll swank around being too hot. There you are. Right. But I did tell him. Aren't you going to the bar? I'm doing it on purpose. Now he's with her... Yeah, serious. Come on. No. Yeah? Yeah. Yeah? Yeah. They're all nuts, aren't they? Yeah. I'd better go, I'm closing soon. Yeah. See you later then? I haven't got the nipper. Okay, see you then. They played Uruguay or South Africa. I can't remember who else. It was a draw. Hello, Carina. - All right, Carina? - All right. Gran wants you to pick up Victoire's stuff. I'll pass by. For God's sake. Down a bit. No, up, up. Down now. Shit. Lower it a bit. Let it go. Let it go down. Gently. We're good. - This is like slave labour. - Slave labour? You don't know what slave labour is. You'll be happy when it's done. Top level FIFA evenings. Yeah, full up on pizza. You better keep it clean. It's not a hippy squat. - Air it, if you smoke. - I don't smoke. - You don't? - I swear, I don't. I wasn't born yesterday. Don't smoke. Cigarettes are shit. The worst drug there is. You're better off sniffing glue, right Franje? Rubbish. Do you sniff glue? Rubbish. Can't you tell he's talking crap? Don't do that, kids. It's bad. I don't want to go back to Nice. You just got here. You're already thinking of leaving? You don't know what it's like. I'm traumatised. Just enjoy your time. You can see I am. Alhamdulillah. You're gross! Are you a Muslim now? Rubbish. Me, Muslim. Half my friends there are Muslims. Nice is really dodgy now. Last time, I saw a veiled woman. You could only see her eyes. I was shocked. Shocked... Now it's your turn to play. You'll see if it's my turn to play. Can you feel this? - I really like it. - You do? I like it too. I love it when you touch yourself like that. - You like that, don't you? - You're driving me crazy. I love it when you move like that. You drive me crazy too. I'm like a rag under your feet. I can't believe the way you make me feel. I want to break through the computer screen and mount you right now. I love your little pussy. Yeah, like that. You're so beautiful. Carry on. You like that, don't you? You look really turned on. You haven't seen anything yet. I love seeing you like that. You've got an epic arse. It's unbelievable. You're like a Greek Goddess. Like in mythology. - Rubbish. - You let him go! That's an expensive monster truck. 85 million. All right guys? All right Bastien? Life is cool, my dick's on top form. Lewandowski will score 30 goals a season. - Sure. - Take Dier, Trippier. They've got qualities and fighting spirit. They're worth 22 million. Why not take them? Right. You only want English players. - Lewandowski's English? - Whatever. - Just eat. - Ah, come on! Come on? The teams are supposed to represent a town or a country, right? It's good when you've got local players in your club. Today, all the clubs are the same. In European competitions, the English played the Italians. There were 2 styles and cultures. Now, tell me what's the difference between United, City, Chelsea, PSG, and Real Madrid? Real Madrid wins trophies. Real's different. They have players from Madrid, from the academy. But for the others, it's ridiculous now. All the teams look alike. People like to identify with players from their country or region. That's how it is. Or exceptional foreign players who bring something special to the team. Why do you support a team? Why are you a supporter? There's no more emotion! You're from Ajaccio and you support English teams! - You want it to be like pre-Bosman? - Why not? You have a chance of keeping your academy players. It's more balanced. Now, it's up to who's got most money. There's Financial Fair Play. PSG wiped their arse with FFP. Give up. Qatar brings a billion in taxes. That's the least they could fucking do! It's all about their image. It's all they've got. They live in a sandpit! Come on! And Baldy says "we can't go back pre-Bosman, it'd stop free movement of workers". Go organise your shitty world cup with 72 teams! Yeah, right! That's better. Come on. I don't like this place. Two minutes. Eros! Here boy! My best friend! - The spotty one's nice. - Which one? The little one. Don't cry. I'll always remember the day we met. I was sleeping, here. The phone rang. It was the scheduler from the Centre in Valenciennes. She called me to fill in for someone. In 24 hours, my life changed. I had to pick up her cat on my stopover in Paris. Someone at a cafe gave me the cat in a cage. I caught the train. I always felt my life was extraordinary when I took the train. I got to the station, with my bag and the cat. The scheduler was waiting for me at the exit. With her fat arse. And Clothilde. Clothilde was all smiles. At first, I didn't notice her. And then... And then what, Theo? The fairy tale. I felt nothing. What do you mean? I was too angry to appreciate anything. I was constantly scared of the future. Scared of losing this happiness. I was always scared of starting over. I was living above my means and beneath my values. I'm sure it was. I'm sure it was. You have to travel. Will you travel? Yes. With you. I love you. - I love you, too. - I love you. In life and in death? My sister. Your jug weighed heavy In the beating sun I would work And never find the time And the young handsome lord Would come to see you Anghjula, my Anghjula, I cannot deny it You gave your youth To this lord Who in the house Made you with child ...bait... But I'm not a fish. I know. "Lucienne, teach the children what's in the books we give you. Or else poof!" So, poofâ€¦ I didn't hold out. It's inhuman. Inhuman. We had no business being there. It was their land. France must regain its sovereignty, and pull out of all that. Or else, we're heading for a fall. They worked hard to create confusion in people's minds. Now, when you talk of sovereignty, they say you isolate yourself from the world. Of course. You can't be sovereign and have constructive relationships with the rest of the world. Because for them, it's not compatible. Let's drop it. It's all nonsense. Sovereignty is the foundation of the State. It's personal choice and action. And when you make your own choices, your relationship to people and things is healthy. At all levels. We're an annexe of the United States. Europe is for technocrats and bankers. We keep our mouths shut and do as we're told. You can stop now, thanks. Gently goes. Good. Hold on. You work, you consume, you mind your own business, and you reel off your lesson. In the meantime, they're up to their tricks. Happy is he who lives by lies. Freedom is a personal thing. You can't judge it through comparison or possession. I paid for my freedom. I paid a high price for it. - Shall I close the shutters? - Yes please. If that's not enough, they play you off against your neighbour. The poor against the poor. And they carry on their business amongst the wealthy. Money controls everything. It's not politics, nor religion. That's just an old fantasy. It's like when I see those young girls, the Felines. The Felines, what's that? The Felines. The ones who show their breasts in churches. The Femen. That's it, the Faymens. Same thing. I don't agree with them in any case. When they desecrate a church in Paris, they're fighting the wrong battle. Christianity no longer influences French politics. That's an old fantasy people keep alive. What they do is disrespect the good believers. I've never hurt anyone. Never. Ever. But them... They don't represent progress. They're just putting on a show. They're not cultivated enough to lead this struggle. They're only harming their cause. Do you know what they do? They fuel the hatred of people who have as little culture as they do. It's just as stupid as the lunatics who attacked the mosques in Ajaccio. Women's rights, yes. You have to fight for that. But they're taking on the wrong target. I forgive them. In the meantime, people are rubbing their hands together. Divide and rule. That's as old as the world. "Love one another." I say no. We're all here and you have to make do with it. As for the rest, there's supposed to be the Law. What about your sister? She says I talk about things that don't concern me. What about her? She's dreaming. What does she think? - That she can teach me things? - No, Gran. In my opinion, she's on drugs. Look at your father and your uncle. Those 2, apart from dominating... They're both like their father. Yes. Fate. You know. I'm tired. Very tired. Or love. For the little love he gave me. "I've got the travel bug", your father would tell me. Travel bug? Money bug, more like. He'd come back with jewellery and panther skins. "What shall I do with those?" I'd say to him. "You'd be better off giving them to your mistresses." I'll tell you something, grandson. I always preferred to live modestly, simply, and honestly, rather than enjoying comfort and luxury to the detriment of others. And that's not a question of religion. Beatitude is different to that. Your sister says I ramble. But I don't ramble. I have to get it out. I have to get it out. It hurts. I can't get over it. It's like a knot. Twisting inside of me. I can't get over it. It has to come out. I've seen enough. It's too much for one woman. Remember to drink your water. Yes, my love. Look. I filled the bottle earlier. It's half empty. Right, I'm off. Go and have fun. Shall I switch off the TV? No, I'm going to watch my soap opera. I'll have a lie down after. Water the geranium on your way out, will you. Yes, I will. Bye bye. That one, won't hold out a month. Needs a change of place. Not enough sun. There's lots of important things in life. Sex, money... You'll see. You might know about sex already, it's transient. Money comes and goes, but friendship, here in any case, is one of the most important things. You're together now. I'm just the coach. What we'll all experience here because this isn't the first match, is very important because you're together. You'll be on the pitch for 30 or 60 minutes. I want you to be like brothers, like people you could die for. You're going to make efforts. If GhjasÃ¨ misses a pass, you don't yell at him. I can, but you don't. When you're on the pitch, there's 8 or 9 of you but you act as one. As one. You're together. Together. To my mind, technically, they're better than us. But that's not what matters. We'll make up for that with something else. Together, but greater than friendship, is fraternity. You make efforts for each other. No arguing. So, we're going to hug each other. Tightly. Like fags. LÃ©o! What the fuck are you doing! You're fucking useless! Where's your head! Are you stoned, or what? For fuck's sake! Kick it forwards! Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! Run! Good! Run! Follow him, Paulan. He can't go on his own. What a fuck-up. You play. I'm not playing any more. - Come and play! - I'll come in a bit. Paulan! Give him time to calm down. Louis, let me calm down. We don't give a fuck if we lose! Come on. Just play. All that for fuck all. Score 3 goals, that's it. I don't give a fuck. He tried to trip me up and he shoved me. I'm not some slag you push around. He can be 6'6" and weigh 600 kg. I'll fucking do him. It's ridiculous. You're from the same valley. I'm not asking you to like him. This doesn't matter. Come on! Go on, Paulan! Don't kick it out! It's not out! Now, that's the Great Wall of China! Even I'm frightened. She needs blood on her face. Blood's pointless. Give up with the blood. It's overdone. You're right, there. The last time I was this stressed was on the orange slide at Waterworld. Ah the stress! Nonsense. - There's a car! - Hurry up! Shit head! I've had it. People don't even stop. There's another one. This is crap. It doesn't work. I told you, the white queen is so nineties. White queen? Sounds like a pizza. Whatever. White Queen. White Lady. It's all the same. You can see it doesn't work. Nina, twerk! That'll do it. In your dreams, idiot. Lads, did you hear that? What, bro? - You didn't hear anything? - No. You're fucking disgusting! Bombs away! The Doubs Ripper. - It stinks of shit. - Someone's coming! Guys, I recognise the motor. It's my dad. - You recognise the sound? - He'll kill me! That's dangerous what you're doing. Is that you, Nina? Where's Anna-Maria? I'm asking you! I'm not Nina. Do you know what my worst fear is? Having a heart attack whilst I'm having a shit. - Whilst you're shitting? - Yeah, you see. Not bad, eh? - That's a horrible way to die. - It's not a bad way to go. It's best to go in your sleep. No. The best is during sex. During sex, yeah. Like David Carradine. You fuck then you die. He didn't die having sex. He was masturbating. Throttling himself. - Yeah, having sex. - No. He was on his own. How do you know? There must have been a bird. He couldn't have been on his own. Do you get it? Can't you do photography here? I can. But I want to take photos in lots of places. Don't you want to start here? Instead of wanting to photograph what's better elsewhere? - It's not a case of better... - Yeah, but hold on... What sort of thing? - Do you want poetic things? - It can be anything. It can be... It can be a turd on the ground, or a snail. It can be just anything. Yes, but you need a subject. - No. There's no subject. - Come on! It just comes in the moment. You build it, little by little. You experience it, bring it together. You grasp it. You capture it. You create a moment of life. You create a world. - You're creating. - You need an obsession. The obsession comes to you... It can't be just anything. A snail, a piece of shit, a pebble. You don't think about it. You don't think: "I'll photograph a snail". You gather and experience. Live things. You could have a goal. - That comes after. - Yeah, but... Why don't you go, as a daft example... You can go and take pictures. You don't need to go far. You could go to the Ajaccio suburbs, round the dodgy areas. I'm sure you can find people high on coke or crack. You can hang out with them and use them as your subject. Of course. - You don't need Amazonia or Japan. - I didn't say that. Give me a light. I'm not saying I have to leave to find good subjects. I'm not saying I'll find good subjects by leaving. I find interesting subjects here too. I'll walk around and the desire will come. Give him a light. It doesn't just happen. - You'll end up a smoker again. - I won't... It takes time. We're getting to know each other. I never thought I'd hear you say that one day. There comes a time you have to settle down. I'm happy for you. She costs me a bomb, though. You look after her well? She bleeds me dry. She's like Carina. - Yeah, well Carina... - She lives in luxury. She's high maintenance. Like all women, I guess. That's women. You've got to deserve them. You've got to buy them things. You've got to pamper them. Well, you know... If it means getting your dick sucked, you can lay out a bit of cash. It's great getting your dick sucked. - I miss that. - Miss what? Getting my dick sucked. You can't imagine how much I miss it. Yeah, it's true. - Some of them aren't up for it. - What? Some of them aren't up for it. You've gotta get one who likes it. You can tell if they like it or not. You can tell at a glance. Yeah, yeah. A girl who's focussed. Who'll really work on it. Who can understand your dick. Who knows what she'll do, use the right amount of pressure, all that. - One who looks at you. - That's beautiful. The best are the ones that look at you when they suck you off. There's the ones that look and those that don't but who let you watch them. You push their hair out of the way. And you watch. She knows you're looking but she's too busy. That's great. Then you've got the gobblers. The ones who make noise? Yeah, noisy ones. Gobblers, I call them. Gobble! Gobble! Gobble! I love that, you know. I had one like that! - I could put it all in. - Yeah. I dunno about you. Yours is... different. I never have. I've never fit it all in. Yeah. Yours must be massive. You don't mind if I go? I'll see you later then, Lisandru? Have you ever been to gothic parties? I've done punk parties. What about you? Occasionally. They're pretty violent. What's violent, is what you're doing. That's violent. You're a free woman. You don't need anyone. I do my best. But you're on you're own. Not really. You're here. You crush man's last utopia. Being part of a couple. With you, there's no more utopia. If you say so. I say so. What are you thinking about? I'm not sure you want to know. Of course! Or else I wouldn't ask. It might shock you. Go on. I'm not frightened. I'd like to get you dirty. Is that all. I'm a bit disappointed. I want to spread spunk all over you. I should hope so. That makes you laugh, does it? Is that hunting? Be careful... You wouldn't be the first to make the headlines. That could be a good thing. I've got to get going. I've got business to see to. Work well. Perfect! Do you want me to cut up that oak? You'll have timber for the winter. No, thanks. You can take it, if you like. I don't know how to light the fire. Since there's been no man in this house, the fire's never lit. Just let me know, I'll light it for you. There's no need. That's kind though. It's up to you. - Can I ask you one last thing? - What's that? Could you trim the yuccas? It's dangerous for the nipper. If that's all. Thanks, Bastien. Thanks. Is that Charles or Fanfan? It's my brother. Who'd he think he was fooling with his fake plate! Fucking Frogs! She says she can't forget what I said to her. She's right. It certainly suits her family. Her dad and her brother, that is. Her mum's great. You think so? You can tell they're really happy it's over. I can apologise for lots of things. It's true, I was a dick. But, I can't take the blame for everything. I was goaded into it. Not once in 6 years did her dad ask what I was doing. How things were going. No way. He's only interested in himself. You frightened him. Not even. People eat out of his hand. I don't eat out of anyone's hand. That's for sure. Of course, I owe him respect. He's her father. He's older than me. He's been around. I understand that for him I'm still a kid. But respect is mutual, first of all. This constant need for domination. It's just not possible. Like her brother at her uncle's funeral. - I didn't tell you about that? - No. It's quite something. We bury her uncle. Mass. Cemetery, so on. We all go back to her uncle's in the evening for the wake, to have a drink. There was a nice atmosphere. They don't do the same as us. They don't do mourning. I go out for a cigarette and her brother turns up. After 5 years in Paris with nothing to pay for, as his dad paid for everything, he falls flat on his face and goes back to the Morbihan to work for his dad. It's the day of his uncle's burial. So, I ask him, "How's your new job? Do you like it here?" I take an interest. I'm friendly. Do you know what he says, bluntly? "It's going well. Do you know how much I earn?" - No! - I was embarrassed. I said, "Do you like your new life?" "Say a number", he said. "Three thousand, before commission!" The bloke's just buried his uncle and is showing off about his pay. From then on, I thought, with her brother, it's over. What can you say to someone like that? I can't have a relationship with his sort. I can't even pretend. Not a day went by without a shitty joke about Corsicans. Her dad would put on a fake Corsican accent to talk to me. I thought, "Enjoying yourself, mate?" Imagine doing that with a North African? "So my friend, let's have a couscous!" Seriously. Even if we didn't get on, when she argued with her dad and she was wrong, I'd stick up for her dad. Otherwise, I'm headstrong and narrow minded. I'm hard. "Theo's hard". I'll stop bothering you with all that. It's no bother. So are you leaving again? I don't know. - You talking to your uncle now? - Of course. And? Now he's alone at the helm, it's like some augmented fiction. Congratulatory pats on the head. I'm not 20. I can't do it. I'm not his negro. Okay. - You own it 50/50? - Yeah... But at the same time... You miss it? It's much more than that, my friend. And my car packed in. What do you mean? Didn't I tell you? The engine packed in this morning. I didn't exactly look after it. Black is black. Do you want a 4-wheel drive? - I'll give you my 4-wheel drive. - What, the "Mitsu"? Sell it me for a good price. Don't give it to me. I don't use it. I never do. It may as well serve a purpose. If someone in the village asks, say you bought it. - Hello! - Hi there. - All right, Greg? - Yeah, steady goes. We're going to take a breather under the willow. - You've got it easy, haven't you? - Yeah. - Are you coming to the ball? - I should be. Good, we can have a night out. Are you allowed out past midnight? - Exactly. - Nonsense. Watch it, the Carolu comes out late at night. Yeah, you've traumatised us with that. Aren't you going to the procession? No, not really. That's no good. Not good. What about the Virgin! - Good luck for your watch. - Don't wear yourselves out. We'll try. Try the second pond, after the willow. It's better. Okay. Well, well. Youth. The flower of youth. Isn't DumÃ¨ coming up? He'll come up after his nap, around 4. He fell asleep painting. The Lord is with thee Blessed art thou amongst women, And the fruit of thy womb, Jesus Holy Mary, Mother of God, Pray for us poor sinners, Now and at the hour of our death Amen Hail Mary, full of grace, The Lord is with thee Blessed art thou amongst women, And the fruit of thy womb, Jesus That's all good. But we need to keep it up. I'm telling you. How many of our youngsters join and leave after 2 weeks? Don't pressure him. He does what he can. I'm not pressuring him. I'm just saying it's important to join the Friary. Is that right or not? - Do you have faith? - Of course. Good. As long as you have faith, carry on. It's important to carry on our traditions. It's important. When you no longer have faith, you stop, okay? All right. Hold on. Don't move. - Here. - Thanks. - Here, sonny. - Thanks. - How's Joseph? - Fine. Good. It's nice to hear. Good. You care more about him than about me. Not at all, darling. I'm just asking. It's quite normal. He's your daughter's father, after all. I know. I was kidding. That my grandchildren are happy and healthy, for me, that's all that matters. - You here a while? - I'm off to Paris, tomorrow. - How's things? - Paris? Don't give a toss. Dad got the President's okay for the hippodrome. Works start just after the elections. Great news. Of course it is. You'll come too? I don't know anything about that. There's nothing to understand. You do the presidential receptions, I'll sell the horses. It's the best I can offer. And Fanfan? Dad's at the bookies. He's tired. He'll keep an eye on business. It's up to us to take over now. I need some time. You need time? You've been thinking for 2 years. What do you need time for? We'll run local. We don't owe anyone anything. It's not the casino. You won't be stuck out back watching those wankers throwing their money away. It's the high life, cousin. The high life. Anyone who's anyone will be there. Nothing but big names. You'll be like a pig in clover! It's family. Nobody will bother you. Nobody can bother you! You've made your Aliyah. Great. What else is there to do here? Nothing. You want to move a stone, you've got to suck off the State. You want to stick a dolphin in the lake to keep the French happy? Build cottages with that sad git? The sad git says shove it up your arse. You need time. We're not going to wait around for you. Think about your dad's death and all the shit he left. We made sure you'd have no problems. So take what's yours from the casino but now it's payback time. Dad loves you. You're like a son for him. So, he's got expectations. Some things need reconsidering then. Such as? I want to have a say in everything. "A say in everything"? All those wishing to help organise the ball, please meet here at 8pm. It's sorted, granddad. What have you done? What do you mean? The tables are all lined up. They're overlapping the dance floor. This isn't like last year. Rubbish! You said to do it like this. Now you're saying it's no good! I didn't tell you to do that. I said to do it like last year! Okay. Is the spacing okay here? No. It's no good! I've left space between the tables and a corridor to walk along! It's fine! You want to see your friends during the evening. You can go. The waiter can get through easily with the trays. And if an ambulance comes, there's room there. What's an ambulance got to do with it! If it's the same as last year... You've got a corridor running through. See. You're here. You're in nobody's way. So we'll do it like that? Do it all again. I didn't serve Charles. Just a bit? Oh for fuck's sake! Watch it! What about me? There's none left. Do you like poems? Better than piss. "I cut the orange in two. Both halves couldn't be equal. For which one was I cruel, because I will eat them both." Did you find that on Google? No. - Did you buy a manual? - It's Pessoa! - Flirting for Dummies? - No! It's not that easy, Greg. Hello stranger! How are you? Fine? You've come back to civilisation? Society, you mean? Well. Are you dancing? What you were and what you've become. We'll have a drink after, then? Okay. You got a bottle! You cunt! It's Carina's round. You cunt! - I'm paying. - You total cunt! Yeah, right. Here. Have you got a sweetheart? A sweetheart? What are you on about? I haven't heard that in ages. Sounds like something from pre-school. What year are you in, already? I'm at Uni. What's your game? What about you? Are you a fireman? I don't give a toss about your girlfriend. What's up? Life goes on. I had my daughter. I've got no regrets. Let's have a baby. I've got one. I don't want any more. You haven't, so... Just ours. No. We're not a couple. We're not in love. Who gives a fuck about being in love? - You'd like that? - Yeah. You're just saying that. He'd have your eyes, your hair. Your temperament. - Not yours. - No, yours, I said. - Mine. - Yeah. Your brains. Why not? Your personality wouldn't be bad. - You're not like them. - You like my character? Yes. Really. You've got a strong character, at least. If I've contributed to that, I'm flattered you should say so. Only in that way. Don't say you became hard because I made you suffer. - It's not true. - It is true. You made me cry a lot. I cried a lot because of you. I cried, a lot. The other girl I met later, after you, I thought she was like you. So I behaved differently. - And I hurt her. - I don't get it. Oh, yeah, well. You shouldn't do that. Everyone is different. But it's because of you. - It's partly your responsibility. - No, it's yours... You need love. Do I smell the same? I'll give you love. Careful. Watch yourself. - They'll bump into you. - Bump into you? Here... Here, there's no limits. The only limit is the wall. It's when you're up against the wall that you see it best. You see it up close. - Strasbourg? What a mongol. - She's thick! All right, I've got it. Why is Dijon full of shit? Go on, make us laugh. Because Mus-Turd. That's not funny. He's off his head. He's high, Towelie. Lisandru. - Have you got balls? - Yeah. If you're a man, a real one... - You've got balls, right? - Yeah. Dig up the stiff. No way. Shut up. It's between us. - If you've got balls... - Bigger than your head. - If you're just a puff... - If you do it, you're my idol. Are you serious? - Give it a break. - Drop it. She's always such a ball breaker. Do you realise what you're asking? Can't you see he's joking? For fuck's sake. You're off your rockers. It weighs a fucking tonne! Pack it in, you nutcases! Don't be such a pussy, Max! Pack it in! Christ. - It's heavy. - Too right, mate. It's not moving. Oh fuck! Jeannot! Clear off! Shit. Never mind. Keep on. Can I ask you something? Of course. What if he wants to know his mother? His genetic mother. I'm carrying him. Of course. Sorry. How's that possible? It's anonymous. I said, "if" he wants to know her. Are you going to start as well. Start what? I'd just like to know, that's all. You didn't hassle anyone to find out who your mother was. He's not me. Neither are you. He's him. It's different for me. I was abandoned, then adopted. Free of charge. No fees. What do you mean by that? I don't mean anything. Just that we're missing the concerned person's opinion. What do you want me to do? Ask an ovum for its opinion? Well, well. He's serious, your uncle. Dimitri seems better? Much better. Winter was difficult, but it's better since they hired the new radiologist. He earns less but he's home in the evening. Good. It's nice to see him like that. I thought we'd split up. This town drives you nuts. Have you thought of living elsewhere? For the kid. Of course. But not here. Stop it. Don't be so scornful. It's unbearable, Elisabeth. I don't want my kid to end up a hunter enrolled by the nationalists. That's scornful, Elisabeth. There are good people here, of all sorts. You're talking nonsense. There's a lot of scum too. I bumped into Bastien earlier. There's several blokes inside him. Bastien, of course. It's the same everywhere. In the metro, you'd get 20 like him. And more dangerous. I'm not sure I'd get 20 henchmen in one metro. I remember a time when you quite liked a bit of rough. I was expecting that. You lot are always smarter than everyone else. What do you mean "you lot"? Meaning? "There may be losers here, but also supposedly 'open-minded' people, supposedly 'tolerant' people who've fucked me over. 'Bourgeois humanists'." "Bourgeois humanists"? Oh yeah? Coming from the local lord? Bourgeoisie is a state of mind, my dear. It's a cultural consensus. It's tribal. It's normal you don't see it. Your own farts always smell good. Fuck you. - More Corsican than the Corsicans. - Exactly. I'm the exception that proves the rule. All these cameras they've put everywhere. It's like The Truman Show. How much did that cost? - â‚¬200,000. - Are you kidding? - Not at all. - Good God. If they're that paranoid, why not just put a draw bridge at the village entry? â‚¬200,000. And nobody said anything? When you buy cars for the village youths, you have social peace, Elisabeth. Hands off my sister. - Got it? - I haven't touched her. - Got it? - I haven't touched your sister. - Got it? - Stop it! Stop it! - Don't touch her! Hands off! - Stop it! Stop! - Hands off her! - Stop! Stop it! Stop it! - What are you doing? - Have you got it? Stop it, bro. Stop it. Not here. Stop it. I'm gonna lose it. What are you doing? Pack it in! Just stop it! You fucking cunt! He got the shit beaten out of him. Theo doesn't look much. He's stringy. Yeah, I know. But when he starts, he's all nerves. That was bound to happen. Greg had been asking for it, hanging around her. I saw them at it, behind the church. No. I can't believe it. I swear. On my mother's life. I didn't say anything. It's their business. "Don't poke your nose in where it doesn't concern you". She's there. Hey, frog, come here. Let's have a word. Do you think I don't know you're telling everyone I'm a liar? That's nonsense. Who said that? Nonsense? I was told. My sources are reliable. You look here, I better not hear it again. Ever. If I do, I'll call my uncle. You'll never set foot in the village again. Not a foot. You saw what happened to Greg? Don't step out of line. I'm telling you. Yeah, right. She thinks she's big cause she's shagging GhjuvÃ . Give over, Letizia! Get off everyone's case. Isn't there enough trouble? Is it national mongol day, or what? I don't know if you know, Max, but you're fat. Look at that. You'll have boobs soon. You shouldn't wear tight t-shirts. It doesn't suit you. What a martyr. Poor thing. You want girls to like you? Get this, they don't give a toss about you. The girls all look at Paulan. Yeah, you look like a beached whale. I hope you understood what I said! They really pissed me off! No shit. What does Elsa think? She's dating GhjuvÃ  so she thinks she rules? It's not as if GhjuvÃ 's fit! Elsa's really big-headed. She's the village queen. Nobody's taking my place. I'm the queen. After what you said to Max, I don't think so. Look. Did you see? Why's he poking his nose into my business? "Oh Letizia! Bla bla bla bla!" You're right to tell him to mind his own business but it wasn't very nice to say he's fat and he'll get boobs. - Are you taking his side? - That's not it at all. Not at all. He had become infatuated with Lady Cilistrina, Countess of Sassi, Daughter of Lady Matuttina, Princess of Cardi. When he saw her, he would glance at herâ€¦ When the Lady heard the lion, she said to him: "If you kiss me with those teeth, It's not just my breath you'll cut! If you embrace me with those claws, You'll tear my skin to shreds!" Are you depressed at night? Well, it's strange, causeâ€¦ That said, you're always on your own. You're a bit of a loner, though, so, I guess the night doesn't change much. Does it? If you say so... I'm sure you have dark thoughts at night. You look like you'd be gloomy at night. Or you invent yourself a life. Before sleeping, you daydream that you're a millionaire. I can't figure out who you are. Who you are really. I think you're a... a loner. You're not a loner. But you're not keen on the outside world. It irritates you. Yeah. But... you prefer being alone. Like... But not all the time, it's weird... You've got two faces. Maybe a bit bipolar. Sometimes... A bit temperamental, I reckon. At times, you enjoy being with people. Then other times, you need to be alone. But in the evening, you're the sort to torment yourself. I bet it brings out your darker feelings. Or perhaps you don't think at night. You just sleep. I don't know. Nonsense! What nonsense. You're good at taking people for a ride. Who? Only Paulan says that. That said, there's just 2 of us and the other one's ugly. Don't tell her, right? I really like you, too. It's not easy. It's not as if everybody liked you. - Hello Mr Leonzi. - Hello. - How are you? - Very well, and you? Very well. You know why we're here? You tell me. We came 3 months ago to ask for DNA tests, to clarify things. We still don't have them. I have nothing in writing. We've been asking for the papers for 3 months. - What have you done about it? - You think I'm doing it on purpose? - That's my impression! - Sorry? We've been waiting 3 months! I've been waiting ages for the papers to be ready. I went to see them. They said to come back after. That's where it's at. I can't work like this. What's your problem? What's your game? You said I had time to set things straight, and now you're on my case! You're past the deadline. We need animal traceability. Did you hear me? I'm missing one paper. Give me time to deal with it! Give me time! We're not here to complicate things. Just the opposite. Well you are. And not just a bit! I'm all alone here. I've got fences to mend, animals to feed, sprinklers to mend. I do everything. He helps but we can't do everything. So, your papers come after all that. Got that? - That doesn't suit me. - I can't do any different. You've got 2 weeks to provide the ewes' DNA results. You can't move your sheep until then. - Just fuck off. - Be polite, please. Just fuck off, right? No. If you don't respect DDPP rules, your animals will be destroyed and picked up by the slaughterhouse at your expense. You'll lose out. - I won't pay a thing. - It's up to you. I don't care. They're not my animals. Just clear off. You've got 2 weeks, Mr Leonzi. Clear off! - Have a good day. - Goodbye. Two weeks, Mr Leonzi. - We'll be back in 2 weeks. - Just clear off. - I don't understand, Auguste. - You don't? Tell your dad to stop backstabbing me. Sending his vultures every 2 months. If he wants trouble, he'll get it. I'm not scared of him. You tell him straight. If I lose my sheep, I'll fly to Bamako and I'll knock him for six! Is that clear? We always let your dad do what he wanted. I've always been honest and kept my nose clean. I was always there when I was needed. If he isn't over your mother dumping him for me, he needs a shrink! I won't pay for it all my life! Fuck it, if I'm filmed! He'll see I'm not kidding! Where the hell are we? Where! On the village squareâ€¦ Achille Tomasini square. The greatest mayor this village ever had. Your uncle was like a brother to me. He left me the land to work on and keep any tricky business away. Got it? Now you listen, Carina. He's going to have to ease up. Nobody in the village wants him any more! The tide's turning! Got it? He better be careful! We've let a lot pass. That's over now! Thank you so much. They're so glam. You're welcome, my darling. They're beautiful, like you. Thank you. You're so sweet. No. Just truthful. Always. When are you going to come? I don't know, honey. I'm really busy, you know. You can take a break, can't you? Come and have fun here. I'll take you for some lobster in Centuri. We haven't known each other that long. I know you as if I'd made you. I love you, Cindy. Shall we get on? I've only got 23 tokens. Next time then? Everyone's waiting. All right. Thanks again. They are really, really beautiful. You're welcome. That makes me happy. Next time, then? Yeah. Kiss. Witch. I can't. Nothing here inspires me. It doesn't work. I'm blocked. There's nothing. It's really beautiful. There's flowers and trees. But I'm not interested in beauty. It's too nice. I need something else. You're not interested in beauty? It's not that it doesn't interest me... The last time I said that, I ate my balls. Did they taste good, at least? Well that's good. Have you got money? - Yes. - How much? A thousand. That'll last 3 days. So, I'll work. I'll give you 3,000. Where will you get 3,000 from? I'll give you 3,000. - You're leaving for you? - Yes. - You're not going for someone else? - No. I met someone who lives there but I won't live with him. I'm not leaving for him. He's got contacts, though. - You won't be dependent on someone. - No. Don't act like some groupie. I'm leaving to be alone, not to be dependent on someone. It's a pity, isn't it? What is? There's so much to do here. But not right now. That's not what I want now. It wasn't him. It wasn't him. Are you sure? Positive. Apologise to Carina and everything will be fine. He'll forget it. It happens. You're overworked, having a hard time. You two have had your problems. You can make mistakes. - I'd like you to take this, though. - What is it? - Pay what you need. Forget the rest. - I can't accept, Franje. Please. No. Okay. Well. All right. Go broke then. That's better. Very bright. Thank you. I'm the one thanking you. Let's not talk of it any more. I'm going to see Max. Do you want another coffee? Yes, please. When are you leaving? At the end of the month. It'll be hot, won't it? It'll be the rainy season. You should take photos again. You took nice pictures. It's a pity. I can't do it any more. Photography's dangerous. Dangerous? When you realise a photo can make someone stupid, It's best to stop. Since Suzanne's death... I was looking at photos of her, the other day. As beautiful as she was, I managed to make her stupid. Stop it, Auguste. You're annoying me. I'm not kidding. It's true. They were the piÃ±ata party photos. Do you remember? You didn't want to break it. I've got photos of your dad with the red wig from the Crazy Horse. Ah, forget it. It's an old classic. It was another time. No kidding. Fucking traffic jam. "Blower"? What's "blower"? "Blow" means air? "Blow". Have you seen the rain? August storms. It's mad isn't it? It's sunny one minute and cold the next. I don't know how to dress any more. At least the river will fill up. True... Did you see FranÃ§ois-RÃ©gis today? Yes, this morning. So? He's cold isn't he? Did you think he'd make you laugh? It's good you're here... Otherwise this village... it's a drag. He does nothing but read. If at least he read interesting things. I'm the African in the family. What do you think of my hair? Nice. Was it better before or now? It's different. Tell the truth. It is the truth. It's nice. Very femme fatale. Thanks. Do you want a drink? A coffee. Red wine, white? I've got to work, after. Red after white... I'll have a glass of white then. Okay. Can I talk to you about something? Of course. There. Thanks. Switch on the radio, please. The batteries need changing. It doesn't matter. I dreamed of my mother, last night. I was convinced it was her. I was positive. I got the impression that I'd always known her. We were in a town, on a large square, and she was telling me I should always be nice to women. She said it with a smile. And as she was saying it, I felt that I would never know love. I had the feeling that that moment, with my mother was like a recollection that I'd already missed out on love. That the memory was there to remind me of failure. Sleep... Sleep is the key to our darkest questions. I saw my mother, Gran. Now, I know what she looks like. The way she walks, the way she looks. It was her. She was beautiful. All women are beautiful. You were communicating with your mother. You think so? Wherever he goes, whatever he becomes, a child is always connected to his mother. Now, I must sleep. You're a handsome boy. You're not bad at all. Who are you? It's me. "You"? FranÃ§ois-RÃ©gis. "Here lies a youth... dead..." Shit. "Here lies a youth, dead of consumption. You know why." I call upon the Muse To compose these few verses I'm here on these slopes And live in Albitrone I'm so sad and inconsolable The death of Filicone At Filicone's death How much pain has it brought me? Hunters have gathered with me From all around the Isle They came from Fiumorbu, From Serra Di Scopamena When they learned That Filicone is dead Hunters of Casinca... O who will stand guard Over our abode in Albitrone? By day and by night? We shall be together always Now all is over For Filicone, is no longer
