[slow music] [birds chirping] [grass rustling] [machine whirring] [sighs] - [Bo] Mom? [bed squeaks] [birds chirping] [knocking] Mom? Mom, wake up. What are you doing out here? We're gonna be late. - [Deacon] "He went down with them and came to Nazareth and was obedient to them, and his mother kept all of these things in her heart." I lost a child in a store once. There, I admit it, I'm a terrible father. You see, when Stephanie was little, she had a great love of key chains. On one visit to the store, the family had split up to conquer our shopping, and Stephanie and I were looking at some items, and she asked if she could go just a few feet away to look at key chains. I told her yes and continued looking for what I needed, until that dreaded sound came over the loudspeaker. "Would the parents of Stephanie Jacobi please come to the service desk?" I hung my head in shame. Just one of the many times I failed miserably as a parent. In our gospel this morning- - [David] Hey, Anna. - Oh, David. - How's it going? - It's good. It's been a while. - Yeah. Joan's been going to church at St. Michael's with her mom. - [Anna] Oh, how's she doing? - She's uh... How's your mom? - She's good. - [David] So, uh, parent-teacher conference tomorrow. - That's right. - I guess we'll see you there. Well. Great. [engine rumbling] [wind blowing quietly] [birds chirping] [crickets chirping] - [Man On TV] I don't know how it works, it's magic. - [laughs] What does that mean? - [Man On TV] Really? - [Man On TV] Sure it is. [audience cheering] [phone ringing] [horn honking] [honking continues] [engine rumbling] [engine rumbling] [bell ringing] [chairs squeaking] - Fuck. All right. So, how's everyone's day so far? - Okay. - Good. - It sucks. - That's good. Did everybody do the reading for today? - [Class] No. - I hope so, because we have a pop quiz right now. [class groaning] Right, in one second. You guys are in luck, I found it. [players chattering] [basketballs bouncing] - [Joan] Wanna shoot around? - No, I'm good. - I think my dad likes your mom. - What? Where'd you get that? - Do you think she likes him? - I don't know. [locker clanking] [locker slams] - So, I hope you don't mind getting out of class just a little early today. - Uh, no. Any excuse to be pulled from school is fine by me. - Not a big fan? - It's all right. - Anything in particular you're not fond of? - Um. - [Heather] It's hard when you're on the spot. - Yeah. - [Heather] That's okay. Um, your mom tells me she works the night shift at a hotel. - Yeah. - [Heather] So, does anyone else stay with you while she works? - No. - [Heather] You're all alone? - Yeah. - [Heather] How is that? - I'm used to it. [screaming] - It was good running into you at church yesterday. - Yeah, it was good to see you two. - Yeah. - How've y'all been? How's Joan? - She's good. The separation hasn't been easy, honestly. - I'm sorry to hear about that. - Oh, it's okay. - You two seem close. - I have her, you know, once a week, and every other weekend, and then I get to see her at school, you know, in the hallways and in between classes and stuff like that, so I mean, I'm lucky in that regard. Uh. - What do you guys like to do, for fun? - I force her to hang out with me. Sometimes on the weekends we'll go to this dance hall. It's fun. At least I think it's fun. Um. Anyway. Aren't we supposed to be talking about your kid here? [Anna laughs] - Is he behaving? - Oh yeah. I mean, his participation could be a little bit better, but um, teenagers can be like that, you know? So. - Right. - He's a good kid, you know? And [sighs] I know his father's not around anymore. Sorry. I'm an idiot. - No, it's fine. - It's none of my business. Uh. Anyway. Um, there were a few things I wanted to go over with you. Um, so, if you look at [clears throat] his uh, how he's been. These are some of his assignments. [stairs creaking] [rain pattering] [boxes shuffling] [knocking] - Hey, Bo. - [Bo] Hey. - I brought your homework from our last class. - Did you walk here? - Yeah. Can I come in? - Sure. [door squeaking] - It's just a few worksheets. They aren't too hard. - Thanks. - [Joan] Where's your mom? - She's at work. - Do you really think our parents like each other? - Who knows? What's that? - It's from a sawmill. It's where my dad used to work. He cut firewood for this guy. He used to tell me his boss was secretly filthy rich. He hid all his money by burying it. Would shoot anyone caught trespassing. Dad wanted to find it. - It's getting late. I think I'm gonna go. See you tomorrow. [door squeaking] [door closes] [crickets chirping] [door squeaking] [engine rumbling] [horn honking] [birds chirping] [cars whooshing] [machine whirring] [logs clattering] [birds chirping] [tire banging] [automatic doors sliding] - David? - [David] Hey. - What are you doing here? - You, uh, forgot your jacket at school, so- - That's not my jacket. - Are you sure? - Yeah, I'm sure. - That's weird. I was pretty sure that this was yours. But um. What's going on? - It's, it's really late. - Yeah. I couldn't sleep. I should probably pick up a night shift or something. You guys aren't hiring by chance, are you? - It's not as fun as it looks. - [David] That's surprising. You've got a swimming pool. - Yeah, I know, it's uh- - Looks like a pretty good deal to me. - It does. It does seem nice, but um, the pool- - I'm assuming you get free snacks. - No, can't eat the snacks. And the pool closes at 10, so. - 10? - Yeah. It's hard to take advantage of that. - That's way too early. - I know. Listen, I don't make the rules, I just follow them. - Yeah. I guess when you get older you gotta play by the rules and be mature. Cannonball! [water splashing] [Anna squeals] - [laughing] Oh my god. - Whoo! Cold. Holy shit. - I'm completely soaked. I got you wet, I'm sorry. - Yeah. [laughs] [clock ticking] - [David] Hey uh, Bo, could you come up here for a second? So uh, you have a note or anything for yesterday? [sighs] 'Cause you know, when you miss class, it's not good, so. No one wants to have to repeat a grade, you know? Especially in high school. It'd be embarrassing. I don't wanna have to call your mom, but you know, I will if I have to. So. Um. All right, you can... That's fine, you can sit down. [students chattering] - Can I sit here? - Yeah, sure. - [Bo] I need your help. I'm gonna find the money. - [Joan] What? - At the sawmill. - Bo, I'm not gonna help you steal the money. [wrapper crinkling] - You live with your mom? - Yeah. - What made you choose her? - My parents decided. - Okay, but if you had to choose, would you live with your mom or you dad? - I don't know. - [Anna] Did you skip school yesterday? I think we need to go back and see Heather tomorrow. Maybe you can explain it to her? - [Bo] I don't wanna talk to her. - You have to talk to someone. - I'm not doing anymore therapy. - [Anna] Why? - I'm just done. I'm not gonna do it. - You have to do it. - No, I don't. - Anna, can I talk to you for a second? - Yeah, sure. Here are the keys. - So, I just wanted to check in with you, kinda see how you were doing. - Yeah, same old. - You have any fun plans for the weekend? - Not really. - Maybe the two of you should do something fun, you know, together. - Okay. - You know, I'm here if you decide you ever wanna talk to someone. - Thanks. [door shuts] It's getting cold. Do you need a new jacket? - No. - You're gonna get sick if you don't stay warm. - I'm warm enough. - Let's go out this weekend and do something together. - [Bo] Fine. - David asked us if we wanted to join him and Joan for some live music. - What? - He said it was Joan's idea. That she would love it if we came. [engine rumbling] [paper rustling] - Joan. - You miss a lot of school. - [Bo] Yeah, I kind of have a lot going on right now. - Seems like it. - I appreciate you walking all the way here, but I don't care about the homework. - All right, then. - [Bo] It should be here somewhere. - What are you looking for? - I got it. - [Joan] You really think you'll find something? - I'm gonna try. You sure you're not up for it? - Why do you need the money so bad? - It's not about the money. My mom never believed any of this. - [Joan] Why do you need my help? - I need a lookout, someone to distract him. - What am I supposed to do? - You'll think of something. You're like, the smartest girl I know. - [scoffs] Please. - So, will you help me? [cars whooshing] [birds chirping] - We going, or what? - Yeah. [birds chirping] All right, if you go that way you can enter through the garage. - All right. - You okay? - I guess. - [Bo] You'll be fine. [machine whirring] - Excuse me? - [Robert] Can I help you? - Uh, I, I live down the street. My mom, she wanted me to ask you about this tree in our yard. It fell, during a storm. - [Robert] What kinda tree is it? - Uh, I don't know. [shovel creaking] [train horn blowing] [Joan] Did you find the money? - We'll have to go back after it gets dark. - No way. I'm not going back there. - We have to. Why'd you tell your dad to invite us out this weekend? - Sorry. I thought you could use the distraction. - I thought of something I could use the money for. - [Joan] What's that? - So I can leave. Get away from here. [upbeat folk music] [audience cheering] - [Musician] Thanks, y'all. We're gonna take a quick break. - So, what do you think? Are we gonna dance? [upbeat folk music begins] - No. - Come on. - No way. - Why not? - Because I don't wanna look like an idiot. - No one's gonna think that. I wouldn't. - Yeah, because you're my mom. - [David] Hey, hey. - [Anna] Hey. - Glad you guys could make it out. You haven't been waiting long, have you? - No, we just got here. - Awesome. What's up, Bo? - [Anna] The band seems great. - The band's awesome. You guys hungry? - [Anna] Yeah, we could eat. - Could eat a damn horse. - You're being weird, Dad. Stop being weird. - I'm gonna put an order in. You guys uh, want anything? - Yeah, I'll come with you. [upbeat folk music continues] Thank you. - For what? - For inviting us out. - Oh, yeah. Anytime. - My dad loves coming here. It's kinda lame, but it's not so bad. - Whatever. - You're not the only one that hates seeing your parent with someone else. - Leave me alone. - You know, I didn't wanna help you steal that money. - You didn't have to help me steal the- - But I did. I didn't have to, but I did. I never wanted to hang out with you in the first place. My dad just made me because he felt sorry for you because your dad killed himself. You're just like him.

How are things here? - They're fine. - Good, um. Yeah, I thought we should talk, um. So, earlier, a little earlier over at my house, um, your- - What is it? - Um, [sighs] how is uh, Bo doing? - Look, I'm sorry about last night. - Oh. I, I mean, yeah, no, I had fun. I mean, I think we all had fun mostly. Um. But maybe I should give you guys some space, you know? - What do you think this is? 'Cause it's not like we're dating. - What do you mean? Us talking? We're- it's just us talking. - [Anna] I mean, we're just friends. - Yeah. I know. I know that. I didn't think we were dating. I mean, I thought we liked each other, and um, [sniffs] I thought there was a little bit of an attraction. I'm not gonna lie. - So, you don't need to worry about my son. - So you have to be dating to worry about someone's son? Is that standard? I mean, I am his teacher and I thought we were friends, and um, I do like you. And um, you might be right. And uh, I think you're a good mom. [door squeaking] - Mom? - I know you think it's my fault your father's gone. Maybe it is. [pot lid clattering] Get yourself some soup before it gets cold. [paper tearing] [students chattering] - [David] All right. So, should we get into the reading? - [Student] No. - All right, great. Let's get into it, then. [paper tearing] Bo, what did you think? - Of what? - Of the story. You must have it down pretty good 'cause you're working on something else there, so I figured. Did you read it? - No. - Why not? You're kinda getting on my last nerve here, Bo. Um, can you just go read it in the principal's office? You can discuss it with the secretary or something. I think she was an English major. Anyway. So, comedy versus tragedy. No, comedy equals tragedy plus time. What is, what do you think that means? [phone ringing] - [Secretary] Hi, North Harrison High School. Hang on just a second. Let me check. [birds chirping] [footsteps approaching] - You interested in this one? - What's the cheapest car you have? - The cheapest? - Yeah. - You here with your parents? - No. - I'm not sure of the cheapest. We could take a look. You wanna come inside? [bell chiming] Do you live around here? - Yeah. - Go ahead and take a seat. Can you drive yet? - Yeah. - Okay. If you're serious about buying a car, let's give your folks a call. - I can give you a check right now. I have it right here. See? - [Salesman] Doesn't really work like that. [cars whooshing] - [Driver] Where you going? - I'm, uh. - [Driver] Are you getting in, or what? - Anna. - Hi. - Would you like to come in? - Yeah. Thanks for taking my call. - [Heather] It's no problem. - Do you have any kids? - [Heather] I don't. - I had Bo so young. I was really scared. I just felt like I wasn't prepared, you know? I still feel like that. - [Heather] I can imagine. - When he was younger, he used to come up to our door in the middle of the night. He had a hard time sleeping, and he would just knock until we let him in. I miss that. [logs clattering] - [Robert] Nice shirt. Where'd you get that at? - It was my dad's. He used to work for you. - I'm gonna get a fire going. You can come in if you want. [door squeaking] [paper rustling] So, what were you doing here the other day? - My dad used to tell me stories about you. - Stories like what? - That you were rich. Buried your money. - Is that why you dug up my dog? You Bo? - Yeah. - I remember your dad. I'm sorry to hear about that. I hate to disappoint you, but I'm not rich. I've never buried any money. - You're saying he lied? Made it all up? - Not saying that. It's just not true. [fire crackling] [fire crackling] [crickets chirping] [engine rumbling] [door slams] - [Anna] Stop! What the hell are you doing? - What do you care? - [Anna] No. [groans] [crickets chirping] [knocking] [bed squeaking] [Anna] Bo, wake up. We're gonna be late. - [Deacon] So, today we realize, the holiness of family life and how blessed we are that God gifts us with the presence of our family. So, let's take just a moment now to spend a little time in silent prayer and offer whatever prayer is in your heart, for the gift of your family, for the gift of God's love and his life in our lives.
