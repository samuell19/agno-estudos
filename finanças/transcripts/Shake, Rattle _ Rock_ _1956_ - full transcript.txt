(Horace snoring) Well, we'll put a stop to that, won't I! - Oh, yes you will, dear. - Now, you've seen with your own eyes how rock and roll is destroying the youth of our nation. - Disgusting! - Revolting! - Disgusting, revolting, all those in favor say aye, carried. - We ought to write to Washington. It's been weeks since I've written Washington. - Now, we need an organized resistance to this vulgar, lewd rocking and rolling. - Sometimes referred to as shaking. - Now, all those in favor of an organized resistance such as the Vigilance Committee, signify. - [Group] Aye! (Horace snoring) - We are waiting for you, Mr. Fitzdingle. - Oh, down with the... What is it this time, Georgianna? - Rock and roll, idiot. - Rock and roll, idiot. - Good, now we will need a strong and militant leader. I suggest the name of Eustice Fentwick. I accept, nomination are closed. All those in favor say aye, carried. No doubt you would like to have an acceptance speech. I accept this nomination with a great deal of reluctance. I did not choose this all-consuming job, but I realize how much you need the best help of the best leader available. - This takes care of my one free afternoon. I'm already organized against 11 different menaces. - Oh, but my wife's got you beat. She's anti 21 things, including Sunday walks in the park. - Ladies and gentlemen, we need a name. Any suggestions? - Well, I thought-- - Suggestion period is over. The name will be will be SPRACAY. - Magnificent name, but what does it mean? - Society Prevention of Rock and Roll Corruption of American Youth. - Oh. - That's two letters more than any group I know of, which reminds me of a funeral service I once held in Arkansas. - Now then, to war! You and you and you! Call up the studios and keep it up for an hour! And you and you write letters to police officials! And the rest of you write letters to the studio. Now, you know what to say. - Indeed we do! We'll use form letter number 12. (group chattering) (upbeat rock and roll music) (audience clapping) (audience applauding) - Today's winners, Carlos and Rosie representing the Black Eagles. (audience applauding) They will be competing for the club awards next month. (audience applauding) And by the way, we have three new clubs incorporated into our organization. That makes a total of 78 throughout the city. Now, Ax McCallister and I-- - No applause. - Will be paying these clubs a personal visit throughout the coming week. See ya tomorrow, cats. Same time, same channel, same bop beat. (Ax sighs) It's all yours, Ax. - Okay, say kids, you were the greatest! Absolutely the greatest! Nobody blew the bit, nobody egged it, you can all stay in the human race. (all clapping) Now wait, wait, wait, wait! Wait cats, before I send you up completely in flames, I wanna know what you been doin' about the money bit? Make me know that, in the meantime, I got some announcements about some real working cats and what they are a-doin'. Yeah, here we are, Lucky 13 are gonna hold an arts and crafts bit. The long green stuff goes into the pot for the permanent building fund, right? - Hi Gary. - Young lady, would you open this refrigerator door please? - Anything to please a customer. - Ah, good, I'll buy it. You can work in my kitchen anytime. You know, it looks awfully good on you. Say, how are you with a stove? - Oh, terrible. (gentle music) - Just Junie and me and kitchen makes three. Hey, what's the matter? Aunt and Uncle object to a possible union? - I haven't told them yet. I think Aunt Georgianna would flip if she knew we were talking kitchen appliances. - Ah, they don't go for me, huh? - They don't go for this. They're even organizing a group to fight rock and roll. - Oh honey, these crackpots just come and go. - Not Aunt Georgianna. She hangs on like a bulldog, doesn't let go. You're demoralizing our youth, she says. - Demoralizing our youth? Doesn't she realize what's happening? We've now got 78 groups all brought together by the same interest, music. And our activities have branched out into hobby work, dramatics, club newspapers, charity drives, paper drives. All she has to do is ask the juvenile authorities. They'll tell her what those kids were doing before we organized these clubs for 'em. - Hey, you don't have to sell me. I tried to explain it to them, but they couldn't see it. - I guess you're right. - Gary, I hate to break up this touching little scene, but the studio is needed for rehearsal. - Oh, who's workin' out here? - Fats Domino. - Domino? Hey, my kids would give their young brothers to sit in on that. - Oh, I don't know, you know what he does to 'em. They'd tear up the place. - Frank, you just leave that up to me. (crowd chattering) - That's pretty good. - Ax, excuse me. - Oh look, look, these kids are really diggin' the permanent building fund. - Yeah, let it hang, Ax. Listen kids, Fats Domino is headin' this way for a workout. - [Crowd] Fats Domino! - Oh, the most, the most! - Hold it, wait a minute now! If you've got no chores to do and you're willing to stand by quietly and listen, I think I can fix it. - Oh, us cats, we'll be as quiet as mice. - Now, wait a minute, okay, okay now! Just gather around quietly, come on. Now just stand by, here he is now. Say Fats? A bunch of the kids would like to listen to you blowin' up a storm. Would you let them listen in? - Well, there's a rule that we don't do it, but for the kids, I'm more than glad. - Hooray! (crowd applauding) - I just wrote a new number called "Honey Chile." Would you all like to hear it? - [Crowd] Yeah! (crowd applauding) - All right boys, so you're all ready? - [Band] Yeah! - Well, let's get going then. ("Honey Chile") ♪ You will never win wonderful charm ♪ ♪ But I love to hold ya in my arms ♪ ♪ Only you can fill me like you do ♪ ♪ So hold let kiss for a long, long while ♪ ♪ You know why I love you honey chile ♪ ♪ I love to hear you whisper low ♪ ♪ You know you really thrill me so ♪ ♪ Only you can fill me like you do ♪ ♪ So please don't put me on that shelf ♪ ♪ You know I can not help myself ♪ ♪ I am happy as a baby boy ♪ You ain't nothing but a bundle of joy ♪ ♪ Only you can fill me like you do ♪ ♪ Bend your legs and pigeon toes ♪ ♪ You know why I love you, goodness knows ♪ (crowd clapping) ♪ You will never win wonderful charm ♪ ♪ But I love to hold ya in my arms ♪ ♪ No one can fill me like you do ♪ ♪ So hold let kiss for a long, long while ♪ ♪ You know why I love you honey chile ♪ ♪ I am happy as a baby boy ♪ You ain't nothing but a bundle of joy ♪ ♪ Only you can fill me like you do ♪ ♪ Bend your legs and pigeon toes ♪ ♪ You know I love you, goodness knows ♪ (crowd applauding) - All right kids, let's hop to it. Get with your homework and chores, huh, come on. (gentle music) Say, by the way honey, when are you gonna sing our love song to your aunt and uncle? - Let's wait a while. - You're not pulling a Uncle Horace on me, are you? If you can't fight 'me, join 'em? - I've got to pick the right time. (disappointed music) (Ax mimics dog barking) - Come along, Horace, come along. It's nearly time for the collection. Come, oh dear, oh dear, what is the matter with you? (tense music) Will you put them down! (Horace sighs) Put them in the box now, hurry up, hurry up. - Oh, don't mail those grouch letters, please! - We feel it to be our civic duty. - If only you'd try to understand before you condemn! - But your aunt don't work that way, June. - I've asked you to stop seeing that corrupter of youth. These will see that you do. They'll break him. - Break Gary? You'll be breaking 5,000 kids who are held together by a common interest. You'll send them right back from where they came, back to gang fights and slums! - Ya know, we oughta think that over, Georgianna. - Oh, you do? Well, the S-P-R-A-C-A-Y does not think, it does. - Hey! - Go ahead, get them in. - Long live whatever those silly initials mean. - They're silly to you but not to me. Get the letters in, get the letter in. - Gary, I've never seen anything like it! 600 letters wishing you death by slow torture. 800 phone calls-- - Yes, plus numerous publicity releases. Look at this. "Citizens committee forms to combat rock and roll craze." Here, "irresponsible leadership can ruin our youngsters "says head of new vigilante committee." - You know, medicine has found ways to prolonging some old squares' lives. You know how they spend it? Beating their gong. - Give me that bottle! - This one? Here. There ought to be a law against prolonging some lives. (Bill groaning) - They're threatening boycotts of the station, the sponsors! - Why don't they boycott breathing? - Oh, these letters were all written by the same handful of people. It's just too bad the others, the ones who know we're doing a job with the kids, keep quiet. - All I know is this can help our ratings. - Ratings? Is that all this means to you? - What else, I'm paid for ratings! - Look, why don't you come with us to a meeting of the Black Eagles? That's a group that's been formed in the slum area. Every one of those kids has a record of some kind! I'd just like you to see how they spend their time now. - Save that malarkey for the social welfare people. Rock and roll's a gimmick that sells Shadrach Shoes as far as I'm concerned. - Oh come on, Ax, let's look for friends elsewhere. (door slams) - I have just one word for you. (Ax groans) (upbeat rock and roll music) That's right, follow the directions. How ya doin' kids? I'm stuck, where are the directions? All I need is the plug. Oh, yeah, yeah. (Ax snickering) Always something, kid. Hey, hey, hey, Gary, Gary, come over here. Look, show them what this wig's doing. Dig it to him, pops! - [Tommy] It's a building down the street the city's condemning. - Yeah. - I'm just playing around with the idea the we own it, and are gonna convert it into Teen Town. A spot of our own, run for and by the kids themselves. - You've got something there. All we need's a few thousand dollars. - Yeah, but the kids figure they can make a lot of the sweat themselves. - My old man would chip in on the cement work. Must be a lot of our squawkers could give a finger. - You know, you've got something to think about, Tommy. Yeah, but right now, our big problem is just to stay alive. - Gee, but it's worth a pitch, huh dad? - I'll try it on for size. - Happy fit. - What are you doing, Petes? - Arts and craft. - Arts and crafts? Where is the dice? - I'm making a leather wallet. - You're make, the last time I saw you make a wallet was in a guy's pocket. Three lousy months in the jug and what happens? I leave behind me a nice, normal bunch of hoodlums. I turn my back, you turn respectable. A couple of you have been known to be smiling at the cops. You are turned rotten, turned rotten. And you are the guy with muscle in on me, huh? What is the matter? Nobody informs you this is my territory from Third Street to the union depot? You think you can just move in and take over just like that? - The kids made up their own minds, Bugsy. - Well, I am not about to stand by and watch you make bums outta these kids. Arts and crafts? (fingers snapping) All right you punks, throw the crooks out. So, you have turned chicken? Turned chicken! Do you see what's happenin' to the youth of today? The next thing you know they'll be going to school every day. Throw them crooks out! I said throw these crooks out! Mister, do you realize what you have committed? You have committed brainwash! (Ax yawns) - Look Bugsy, we got a lot of work to do tonight. So, I suggest you either join us or take a walk. - Ditto, repeat, ditto. - There is nothing I would like better than to cut out paper posies and spread 'em across your grave. - Oh. - Should I give 'em what for Bugsy? - Oh, come here, stupid. Do you not know it is no time to fight in a crisis like this? You have got to use strategy, which you possess none of. Go. - Looks like we're right in the middle of it. Fentwick and his gang yelling corruption, and Bugsy and his boys shouting the same thing. - Yeah, I guess it depends on which video you view it on, huh? Oh, but enough of this philosophizing. (laughs) Big word, huh? Say, I want you, hey chick, come here, will ya? Gary, this is Anita. - Hello, Anita. - Hi, Gary. - She's gonna do a number for the building funds benefit, so will you make with a mouthful of high-five for dad? Get ready, kids! Unhook your ears, dad! ♪ Come on you teen queens, put on your blue jeans ♪ ♪ We're gonna have a big ball ♪ We're gonna romp, stomp, rock on a Saturday night ♪ ♪ We're gonna bop, stop, hop on a Saturday night ♪ ♪ We're gonna leap, creep, jump on a Saturday night ♪ ♪ We're gonna serve soda pop, from the corner shop ♪ ♪ Records that will play, till the break of day ♪ ♪ Come and join the crowd, we'll be shoutin' loud ♪ ♪ Don't miss it, don't miss it, man ♪ ♪ We're gonna do the mambo rock, do the Texas hop ♪ ♪ Most of all we're gonna do the boogie rock ♪ ♪ Jumpin' starts at eight, no one should be late ♪ ♪ Don't miss it, don't miss it, man ♪ ♪ We're gonna bump, jump, rock on a Saturday night ♪ ♪ We're gonna sing, swing, rock on a Saturday night, ♪ ♪ We're gonna flip, flop, rock on a Saturday night ♪ (crowd applauding) - Oh man, the was the most, the greatest, the solidest, you know I've been thinkin'. It's a painful experience, but I been thinkin'. And you know, it kinda gets you here. Here? - Now, just take it easy, Ax, take it easy. You know, anything new like this, you should do just a little at a time. - Okay dad, I'll give it to you bit by bit. Okay, first bit, I figure that these kids can really scoot some loot. Second bit, I figure I can round up a group to really ball for the kids. And third, and most solid bit dad, we should plug this thing over the air. We'll get every cat in town down there. - The way these poison penned epistles are coming in, I doubt if there'd be any air to plug it over. - You mean they'll cancel us, null us, void us? - It's looking more like it every time the mailman comes. - Ooh. Ooh, I'd like to tell 'em off. Those squirrels! In court I'd like to tell 'em off. I would rock that jury down to their ever-lovin' argyles. Who should know better than me what all this means? - Ax, boy, you just got yourself a thought. - Me? How'd I do it? And what is it? - Just let me live with it a while. I'll chew it over with you later. - Okay, take five dad. (Gary sighs) - Looks like they're gaining on us. - Hey dad, dad, look! Here's somethin' to gladden your beaten breast. It's an editorial in the Clarion. Now, get a load of this, focus your audio. It says, "Leave kids alone. "A close examination of the facts in the latest attempt "to curb rock and roll leaves room for doubt "in the supposed evils of this pastime." - "In the final analysis, "youth must express its overabundance of energy, "better on a dance floor than in the alleys, "better around a jukebox than a pool table." Ax, I think we finally got ourselves a friend. I'm gonna find out who wrote this right after the show. - Crazy. - Start the slaughter, Nelson. - Right. (crowd chattering) - All right now, quiet kids. We're on the air in 30 seconds. (fast upbeat music) - Well, what's the good word, bird. - I am not a bird! - I know a lot of buzzards that would be mighty pleased to hear that. - My name is Eustice Fentwick III. - The third? Don't tell me this has happened three times before, man. Well crazy, what can I do you Mr. Useless Bentstick? - The name is Fentwick! - So, what can I do for you Mr. Airwick? - Young man, I once buried a pan just like you. - Oh, not like me, dad, I'm the original. I am the thing! - [Georgianna] Such impudence! - Oh chick, thanks very much. I'm gonna sit this one out. Maybe when they play the next number, you and I can work up a sweat and hop-a-bop? Because kid, nothin' braces me up like a good drag across the slag with a hag. - Oh my hat, oh my hat! Oh, my hat! Come back, give me my hat. Oh! - Lady, you're the craziest one here. Go on! - Gracious, get away from me! Oh! I never saw anything like this place. - Whew, oh Gary, look! That is a delegation from the Clobbered Cats Convention, and that is Mr. Useless Fentwick. Now mind you, he is not the first, not the second, but the third! - Take over, Ax. - In the name of the S-P-A, oh I mean the S-P-- - Uh, that's a railroad, ma'am. - The S-P-A-R-- - SPRACAY. - In the name of what Mr. Fentwick just said, will you please stop that vulgar contortioning out there? - There's no law against it, ma'am. - If there isn't, we'll make one. - I remember I had a case in Galveston once. Lady looked just like you, Georgianna. She was run over by a streetcar. - Shut up, Hiram! - Young man, take us to the manager's office. - Certainly, ma'am. - Don't ma'am me. You've seen the last of June, I assure you of that. Savage! Horace, come along, come on, come on! Come along, come along, come along. All right, come along young man, I'm ready. - Ax, would you wind up the show? I'm taking these people to the manager. - Man, is that what they are, people? - Everything is gonna be all right, honey. - This can hurt. There goes my honeymoon cottage. - Ya know what? It takes two sides to make a battle. From now on, call me General Ax McAllister. (crowd chattering) Pardon me cats, come over here. Hello you out there in video land. Now dig this, there's a brigade of blue noses here out to smash this whole bust up. I need a shoulder, so make with a quill on the parchment, please, and keep 'em coming in, else the whole works will blow up, the club, the permanent building fund, everything. And another thing, get to mama and papa square. Try to sell them the pitch, huh? Radar shows trouble ahead, but are we kittens or are we cats? We can do it, I thank you! Excuse me. Dance! (upbeat music) - All right, sir! What is your decision? - I'll discuss it with my superiors. - An outraged public demands that this be stopped at once! - An outrage public? Four people. - Three. - Quiet. - A handful of people who presume to sit in judgment on the rights of their fellow citizens. - Citizens? Teenage hoodlums. - We want to bring back sweetness to youth, the waltz, the slow fox trot. Why I remember when I was a girl. (Georgianna sighs) - That'd be quite a trick. - Do you intend to sit idly by and watch these youngsters being led into acts of delinquency? - Delinquency? This does just the opposite, and we've got 81 groups to prove it. - Well, if necessary, we'll get a court order restraining them from performing this rolling stone in public. - (clears throat) Rolling rock, Fentwick. - Yeah, rolling well, whatever it is. Come on! - I'd say about six foot, one inch tall? 185 pounds, right? - Very close, why? - Four pallbearers should do nicely. (door thuds) - Thanks for backing me up, Bill. If I wasn't convinced it was a good thing for kids, why-- - The kids, who's thinking about the kids? This feud's given us top rating, we're even killing the networks. We'll build it up as far as it goes. When it gets real hot, we'll switch to something else. - That's all it means to you. Ratings and advertising sales, huh? - That's what pays for your bread and butter, Nelson. You're not falling for your propaganda, are you? That club stuff, it's good for the kids baloney? You don't expect me to swallow that? - Look, I believe we're doing a job for these kids that goes far beyond giving them a chance to just stomp their feet. - By the way things are going, you might have to prove that to stay on the air. - That's exactly what I intend to do. And if I can't, you won't have to fire me. (door slams) (fast jazzy music) - You wanna try your hand at something, Nick? - Ah, this stuff's for kids. - You've been standing there watching for an hour. You might as well take a stab at it. - Dumb, little jerks. Little lord Fauntleroys. - Hold it kids, hold it! Now, this is Mr. Armstrong, editor of the Clarion. He's been giving us a boost in his paper. - Oh man, this cat's a positive gasser. - I beg your pardon? - That's his way of saying thank you, Mr. Armstrong. - Well, you'd never know it. - I just had Mr. Armstrong over to look at that run-down joint we want to call Teen Town. - This all started out of a rock and roll dance group? - That's right, this music is their basic interest, their kind of music. You see, it brought 'em together, and once that happened, why their activities branched out. - And the same is true of your other groups? - That's right, only with some it takes a little longer. - Well, it looks good, if you can figure out what it's going to cost to put that dump on Third Street in shape? - Well, about $12,000 for material. We get the labor free, you see the club members' fathers have promised to pitch in. - Yeah, but that's still a lot of money. Do you think you can raise $12,000 in 90 days? - Well, we could give it a try. - Well, the Clarion will pay the rent for 90 days. If at that time, you've got the money you need, we'll back you all the way. We'll pay the rent and the upkeep, just so long as you keep doing constructive work. - Oh man, man, man, man, man, man, didn't I tell you this was a gasser! - I don't know how to thank you, Mr. Armstrong. - Well, save it till you get the $12,000. You know what would make a good headline, at that? "Clarion Underwrites Teen Town." Goodnight all. - [Crowd] Goodnight! (crowd clapping) - How's that? - Oh, let's get to work on the money angle. - Yeah, how 'bout that bop concert you told us about, Ax. - Ooh, that old thing, well naturally we're going to have people from the top 10. You know, Fats Domino, Joe Turner, Tommy Charles-- - Hey, you're floating, Ax. Back down to earth, huh? - You know what, I'm floating right over here to ask you, didn't you have those cats on your disc jockey show? - Well, yes. - Ask him! (crowd chattering) - Okay, I'll give it a pitch. (crowd cheering) (Horace snoring) - June, I don't think that your aunt wants you to go out tonight. - Well, I was just going to take a walk down to the library. - Yes, I know, and when you see Nelson down there, you tell him that your aunt is bringing out a group to his concert tonight. - What for? - To cause trouble. And if there is trouble, they're taking a police officer along with them. - Yes, and if they can't find it, they'll make it. - Now June, your aunt is a very determined woman. And since condemning low necklines has gone out of fashion, she's joined up with this lively group. Now, I'm going to tell you, you hurry up and find that library of yours. - Horace? Horace, come along, we have work to do. - Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, my dear. - Hurry up. - Yes, yes, yes. - I think now. - Yes, my dear. Ah, oh. - (sighs) What is happening to the younger generation of today, Nick? - Uh, lousy jerks. - Oh, shut up, stupid. When I wish you to venture an opinion, I will ask you there of.

All the time they've been taking orders from the law. Now, cut out before they take you home in a wagon. - Hey, hey, hey, hey, remember me? Outside, no agitatin' in here, cat. Come on, come on, out. - Tell the kids to go home. - Hold it kids, hold it! I've got my orders. - Lousy cops. - Ya, let's have some more music. - Oh, we paid to get in, real squares! - Oh now, listen kids, let's fold up our tents and silently fade away, huh? - Now, you're talking sense, Mr. Nelson. - Oh come on, come on. (tense music) (woman screaming) (dramatic music) (balloons popping loudly) Stick 'em up, I got you covered! (woman screams) (crowd yelling) (Bugsy whistles) - Now, we know what's what. - Arts and crafts? I'll show you what to do with a knife. (air whooshing) - Yeah, yeah! (officer whistling) - Scram! - My car! My car! Arrest that man, for contributing to the delinquency of minors. He's in charge. - I'll report it to the chief, he'll take it from there. - Arrest him, officer, if you don't, I'll have your job. - You're welcome to it, ma'am. I want a list of those kids who did this. - Kids, kids? Are you sure this wasn't a hurricane? - You saw them, Nelson, now I want their names. - I can't give them to you, captain. - Oh, so that's the way it is, eh? Anybody gonna cooperate? You know I could book you now, Nelson, for obstructing justice. - Do it now, I insist! - Put him where he belongs, in jail. - I'll do it my way, lady. - Georgianna, let's go home. My feet are killing me. - All this activity and not even one corpse. - Now, I hope you see him for what he is, June, a common criminal. - You better tell 'em, you'll be finished if you don't. - And I'll be finished if I do. - Come dear. Come, officer you'll have to drive us home. - That's a perfect way to end a lousy evening. I'm sure somebody will want to talk to you tomorrow. You're hereby notified to keep yourself available. (Ax sighs) - I'm sorry, I guess I blew the whole bit. Kick. - Nah, I was afraid it might end up something like this. Bugsy's been sitting around waiting for just this chance. And the worst is yet to come. If they ever put me under oath, I'm gonna have to tell them who those kids were. - And then the whole jazz goes up in smoke. Come on, one on the house please. (Ax laughing) Those kids, they really did a bit on old Fentwick's car, didn't they? - Yeah, and on us too, Ax, a real good job. Let's go. (dramatic music) - Still pouring in, it's snowballed, it's always like that. First a few crackpots start the push and the fringe characters move in. - Are all these for wrapping me in cement and floating me down the river? - No, Ax's pitch is bringing in results, some of them with money. That's what makes it so interesting. You've become a public figure. A little controversial but a public figure. Get yourself straightened away with the police and you will be made. - I've got no beef with the police. - Not much, just the names of half a dozen hoodlums. - But if I give those names up, I'm washed up with the kids. Can't you see that? - You and your kids. So, we put you on something else. Main thing is all this has built you up. - And if I don't give the names to the police? - Two weeks severance pay and a guarantee that you'll never work on any station in the country. Besides which, you'll be taken to court and tried for contempt or perjury or whatever they call it. - In any event, I've only got a week left. - I'd say that's about right. By then, you'll put up or be shut up. - How would you like me to build this to a climax that would shut every other station but yours? - Naturally. My happiest dreams run along those lines. What's the gimmick? - It's a natural. I'd like to bring this whole thing to a showdown publicly, a trial with every listener as judge and jury. - [Bill] Whose versus who? - Fentwick and his do-gooders versus Gary Nelson and his Teen Town. A regular trial with witnesses, evidence, prosecutors, the whole works. - I think I see it. You each present your case, and the phone calls and mail determine the verdict. - Right. - Nelson, I love you, (laughs) even if I have to fire you in two weeks. - And what if Fentwick gives me a no thank you? - He doesn't dare. After all the honking he's been doing, he'll love it. He'll be in here, studying makeup inside of half an hour after I talk to him. - You know, I think you're right!

You cats figurin' on diggin' the habeas corpus tonight? - Nothin' else to do. - They have subpoenaed Bugsy as a witness. Me too. - It's a lousy waste of time. - It will be if they stick the shiv in Gary. And you know they will too, if they ask him one question. They'll ask him to tell 'em who roughed up Fentwick's car. And he'll refuse because he's trying to play square with you guys. He'll refuse and that'll be that. And you cats can scramble back into the sewers from whence you came. - And what if he doesn't have to answer any questions? - Then we got a chance, we got a fightin' chance. So, weigh it kids, weigh it, tempus is fugiting. - We've been weighing it all day like crazy. - So, where are you? - With more to do, so if you wanna check out and leave us alone, we'll buy it. - Excuse me, cats. Okay. - Now listen kids, this is what we're gonna do. We're gonna change the whole thing around. We're gonna make a new plan. (tense music) - There. - How do I look? - Oh, magnificent! - Like Liberace's candelabra. - You look positively embalmed, Fentwick. Like a man I looked after in Houston, his wife wouldn't believe he was gone. - The fool. The fool to challenge me to public trial. Thousands of people, maybe millions will see me. Who knows what it'll lead to. Perhaps to a cabinet post? Perhaps even to the presidency? All those in favor of the presidency say aye, carried. - I nominate my wife for vice-president. - I don't know if I care to travel that much. I'd scarcely get to see you Horace. - The nomination is posed, you're elected as vice-president, Georgianna, and I'm gonna take you home and help you pack. - To battle! We must prepare our case. Come in closer, ladies and gentlemen. (soft music) - Ah, you still look great in this setting. Say, have you learned to cook yet? - I'm up to ham and eggs already. (Gary chuckles) We seemed to be pretty far away from the actual breakfast dishes, don't we? - Oh as the cornballs say, love will triumph. - But they're so sure they're going to win. - Maybe they will, but I'll get in a couple of good licks anyhow. Can you just picture yourself the wife of a poor but honest laborer? A poor old cotton picker, for instance? - I love cotton pickin' cotton pickers. - Young man. The next time you do that will be through the bars of a jail cell. - The condemned man ate a hearty breakfast, followed by a kiss. - Now, don't get excited, Pigeon. - What? - You'll ruffle the feathers in your hat. - Oh. - What a nice young man. Will you be wanting organ music for the service? - I'll take Fats Domino instead. - I once performed in New Orleans. Beautiful service, (gasps) beautiful. - Three minutes, Judge McComb's here. - Be right with you, Frank. - What about the names of the kids, are you going to tell them? - I can't. - Then you've lost the case before you've started. - Maybe, maybe not. We'll see, let's go. - It's two minutes, judge. (gavel bangs) - My function is to rule on the legality of the questions and answers. A decision if entered will be rendered by the public. Now, any deliberate falsehood will be considered as being perjurious, any withholding of facts as contempt of court. - Hold your places everyone, we're on the air in one minute. (audience softly chattering) - We got him, Ax. - Crazy cats, you just got here for the top. - You mean you guys are ratting on yourselves? - Yeah, with heavy hearts and light tongues. - What is left to live for? The whole world has gone crazy, democracy is dead. I cannot wait to get back in the stir. - Okay boys, take a seat, thanks. - All right, quiet everyone. We're on the air. - Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Advanced publicity has acquainted you with the purpose of this unusual procedure. We will therefore allow but brief statements to be made by both litigating parties. Mr. Fentwick, you first. (Eustice clears throat) - Your Honor, our case is very simple. This rock and roll's a musical noise symptomatic of a decadent and irresponsible youth. Its savage rhythm leads to lust and crime. - Lust and crime. (gavel banging) - Order! - We demand therefore, that this form of vestiality be outlawed by legislation. And those practicing this cannibalistic exhibitionism be confined in jail the same as any other criminal. (Georgianna clapping loudly) (gavel slamming) - Order! Go ahead, Mr. Nelson. (Ax claps) - Thank you, Your Honor. We wish to prove that the youth of today is no more corrupt than it has ever been, that teenagers are responsible citizens when freed from the tyrannical supervision and the ignorant moralizing as imposed on them by self-styled reformers. - Oh, crazy cat. I don't dig a word, but it's got class, man. (crowd laughing) (gavel banging) - Order! All right, Mr. Nelson. - I furthermore mean to prove that rock and roll music is an art form, a cultural expression evolved by and for the youth of today, and is no more significant or harmful than was the Turkey Trot 40 years ago. (Horace clapping) (Horace coughs) - Statements have been duly made and recorded. Proceed, Mr. Fentwick. - Your Honor, I call for exhibit A. Music please. (upbeat rock and roll music) Dance. - [Bailiff] Lights please, hold the music. - There, Your Honor. You see the source of the disgusting culture form, as Mr. Nelson calls it. Now Your Honor, I wish to call attention to the effect of music, I call for exhibit B. (crowd murmuring) What is your name? - Aloysius Pentigratch. - Your age? - 17, sir. - What are your interests? - Music, the dance, and drama. - Ah, you play an instrument, I presume? - Yes, a piano, sir. - Oh yes. Do you play rock and roll music? - Oh no, sir! I consider it degrading, deteriorating, and degenerating. - Yes. - Man, I must learn that language some day. (crowd laughing) (gavel bangs) - I must have order. - Now, what sort of music do you play? - I find my inspiration from Beethoven, Chopin, Tchaikovsky. - Those fellas play for the Cincinnati Reds, don't they? (crowd laughing) (gavel banging) - I demand order. - You find their works inspiring? - Oh, their emotional subtleties, their pulsating probings of the intellect through music, oh these are the things that make life worthwhile. - And with Your Honor's permission, I will call another witness. - You may. - Would you come here? Now, we will ask you to play something on the piano so that we may better demonstrate the nobility of your meaning. (crowd murmuring) (classical piano music) (crowd laughing) (crowd applauding) (Horace yawning) - Horace. - Your witness, Mr. Nelson. - Mr. Pentigratch, do you agree that music is largely a matter of interpretation? In other words, musical sounds react differently on different people? - Of course! Music can be a purely emotional experience or a mental one. - Then you admit that Chopin didn't conceive of his music being played in any one particular way or interpreted in one specific manner? - That is a safe assumption. - Suppose then, I asked you to play that last 32 bars again, only speed it up and accentuate the rhythm. Can you do that? - I suppose so. - I object! - On what grounds? - On the grounds that he hasn't objected for a long time. (gavel bangs) (crowd laughs) - Quiet! Objection overruled. Go ahead, Mr. Nelson. - Would you play, please? - Yes, sir. (crowd murmuring) - Kids. - Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go. (soft classical music) Oh! (blubbering) (upbeat dance music) Go kids, go! - Hey, that Chopin never sounded that good to me before. - That's because you are an illiterate, underdeveloped ignoramus. - Maybe that's the reason we're such a good match, Pigeon. (crowd applauding) - It's all a matter of interpretation, Your Honor. The times we live in determine the tempo in which we live. - Next witness. - I call on one Gary Nelson. - Ooh man, here it comes. - Tell them Gary, you've got to. - I can't. - You're under oath, you know. You are bound to tell the truth. Were you present at the Teen Town concert the other night? - The concert conceived and executed by teenagers for the purpose of raising money to occupy a permanent headquarters. - Confine your answers to the questions asked. - Yes, sir. - Did this said concert end in a fight? In criminal acts? - Provoked by people who had no business being there, by interfering busybodies who are suspicious of anyone's freedom but their own. - I object, Your Honor. - Objection sustained, answer the question, Mr. Nelson. Did this concert result in a criminal act or acts? - Yes. - By members or your so-called organization? You saw these acts? - Yes. - You could identify the people involved? You will name those involved? You're under oath, you know. - A signed confession, by every kid that took part. - Thanks, Helen. I submit this list in answer to the last question, Your Honor. - I object, I object! - Objection overruled. I accept this piece of paper as evidence. Any further questions? - No, Your Honor. - I've got a question. When do we go home? (crowd laughing) (gavel bangs) - I suppose in this highly irregular procedure, you're entitled to cross-examine the witness. - Thank you, Your Honor. Your name and occupation? (audience laughing) Gary Nelson, disc jockey. Mr. Nelson, you conduct a television program known as "Rock, Roll, and Shake"? (audience laughing) I did. You were present at the Teen Town concert in question. Tell us about the fight. - He'll kill himself, I hope. - Some, excuse the expression, adults came in, the kids didn't like it. There was a character there by the name of Bugsy Smith. He's the one that started the whole thing going. Is that the man, the man you are referring to? That is the man. No further questions, Your Honor. I would now like to call on a one Mr. Bugsy Smith. (crowd murmuring) - I would prefer a six-by-eight jail cell anytime. (crowd laughing) - Mr. Smith, why do they call you Bugsy? - You know, you have got me there. I have never been able to figure that out. (laughs) - You were present at the Teen Town concert. - Yeah, yeah. - Why, just what was your interest there? - I had to protect my kids, you were makin' bums out of 'em. You spoil 'em rotten. - There, what did I tell you? - Lady, by chance, you are not gonna be one of the witnesses, are you? (crowd laughing) - Just how was I making bums out of them, Mr. Smith? - Why the kids used to run bets for me. You know, do odd jobs, break up a window or something when somebody didn't pay up. And then you come along with your la-dee-da, and the next thing you know, they're going to school regular, attending meetings, painting pictures, why some of 'em even been seen going to church. I don't know what is happening to the youth of today. (crowd laughing) - Well, so that's how Mr. Nelson spoiled your neighborhood, hmm? - It is a national disgrace. I am ashamed to live there no more. - No further questions, Your Honor. Your witness, Mr. Fentwick. - I have no questions. I don't wish to say anything to a paid witness. - I object, Your Honor! - Sustained. Disregard that last remark. And watch yourself, Mr. Fentwick, or I'll hold you in contempt. - That's about the only way that you can hold him, in contempt. (crowd laughing) - Next witness. - Your Honor, our boys and girls live in a jet-propelled age. They'd have to be cabbages not to be affected by them. I'd like to call on one of them to act as spokesman for his group. Ax. (crowd murmuring) - Crazy man. - Your name please? - Well, I teed off Monicut Albert, but folks now dig me Ax 'cause I chop a mean tin. - I beg your pardon? - What'd the cat do? - I knew they'd bring in a foreigner to give evidence. - What language is that you speak? Igoroti? (crowd laughing) - Look, you don't dig, eh cube? I yakked that I chop a mean tin. (Judge McComb groans) - I'm sorry but we're going to need an interpreter. Is there anybody here who can understand that gibberish? - I'll act as an interpreter, Your Honor, I dig what he's, I mean, I understand what he says. - Of all my 50 years on the bench, I have... Oh, all right, go ahead. - Excuse me. Say Frank, we'll need several sets of earphones, huh? - Got 'em right here, Gary. - Right. We're ready judge, I'll translate as he goes along. - I didn't think it was humanly possible. Your name again? - They dig me, Ax, I chop, I chop. - They call me Ax because of my ability to get the best in exchange of repartee. - Your occupation? - Hipster, I blow a tin, I beat a skin. - [Gary] I'm a musician, I play a horn or a drum. - [Judge McComb] Proceed. - Yes sir, well I cut from my pad one early bright. - [Gary] I got out of bed one morning. - I float into my set of threads. - [Gary] I get into my suit. - Then I glance in the reflector on the wall. What do I gam? (sighs) Nowhere, a great big nothing from Hungerville. - [Gary] I looked into the mirror and saw that I was getting nowhere, a big disappointment. - So, I figure I'll salt mine it all. - [Gary] I thought I'd work this feeling off. - So, I grab my tin, I chop off a few riffs. - [Gary] I play a few bars on my instrument. - Yeah, zero minus nothing. - [Gary] It didn't work. - No bread, no ox pulling rocks. - [Gary] No money, no work. - So, I figure I'll flounder over and flick my chick. - [Gary] I went to see my girl. - Well, she was masonin' it with her chank and her choke. - Would you, uh, say that again, Ax? - She's masonin' with her chank and her choke. She's masonin' with her chank and her choke! - I, uh, found her at home with her mother and younger sister. (crowd laughing) - Proceed. - The red eye in the silver screen. - [Gary] They were watching television. - And all of the sudden, I gammed this gasser, and judge, I dig him the most. He's making jazz for some diaper dots and dashes. - [Gary] I saw Nelson trying to do something for some kids. - Well, I figure, I like this guy, so I go over and wag a tongue at him. - [Gary] I went to talk to him. - Well, we shoveled each other, and you know what, judge? He took me off the ragged edge and he put me on the every Saturday. - [Gary] He gave me a job. - So, any creep that peeps this cat is zero is nuts! He's the most. - He's doing a good job. - Any questions, Mr. Lipstick? - No, no, send him back. - The defense rests, I am pooped. (crowd laughing) - I am still convinced that I can prove the demoralizing effects of rock and roll. Picture please. ♪ Rock, rock, rock - [Eustice] This is a typical evening of this kind of music. Now, take a look at the utter depravity. You can thank rock and roll for this, the complete deterioration of our young people of today. - Do you care to sum up, Mr. Nelson? - I would like to offer a couple of pieces of Americana for my closing testimony. - All right. - Picture please. (ragtime music) - In the '20s, American culture produced this gay little thing. This delicate little thing was known as the Black Bottom. - [Judge McComb] There will be no profanity in this court. - [Gary] You all survived those savage expressions of youth. And yet our teenagers can't survive rock and roll? - [Eustice] We never participated in these decadent antics. (crowd murmuring) - Would you run that last piece of film again please. (ragtime music) - It is Aunt Georgianna! Come on. Aunt Georgianna, that is you! - Nonsense. Take that picture off immediately! That was not me! - Oh yes, it was, Pigeon because you've still got the trophy at home on the mantle piece. - Oh, just because I was young and foolish. - You worked your own way out of it, didn't ya? That's all my kids want. - I liked you better then than I do now, Honey. - Your Honor, that's all we want. A chance for these kids to work their own way out of their teens. If you wanna help, if you believe in them, in yourself, you can help make this Teen Town dream come true. Now, anybody with a couple of bucks-- (gavel bangs) - There being no further testimony, I instruct the jury to bring in the verdict. - Look at Fentwick, rigor mortis is setting in. - What did you say? Rigor Mortis? - Oh. (Eustice grumbles) - May I suggest that while we're waiting for the results, Your Honor, that we listen to the arch criminal rock and roll as portrayed by a real musician, Mr. Fats Domino. Our television studio will be glad to pipe it in on the screen. - Very well. - Hooray! (crowd applauding) - Hiya kids, this is Fats Domino. I want all of you to know that I'm in love again.
