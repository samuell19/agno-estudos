We won't. - Goodnight. - Goodnight, Pat. - Goodnight. - Goodnight, Jack. [Pat] 'We'll just watch you walk in.' We just wanna make sure you don't get mugged. - We will not get mugged. - I promise you. - She promises you. - Goodnight. Alright. Thank you. It was great. I know. - 'Goodnight.' - Goodnight. [all] Surprise! [indistinct chatter] Alright...I need a drink. Oh. And you sneaked. You never let on. Not once. You kept our boys up this late. Shame on you all. Everybody say goodnight to Kerry and Dan. [all] Goodnight Kerry and Dan. Sleep well, darling. This is your life Michael and Marjorie Delaney. [laughter] How did you do it without our catching on? I sneaked in and borrowed your photo album. I don't believe it. Oh, no, oh, this is.. Look, this is where Michael and I met. It was...I had left accidently 'my poetry book on the campus lawn.' And I found it and then I went in search of the giggling freshman whose dishes I dutifully washed and I found her. You know what he did? He memorized the entire poem just to impress me. And I hate...Rupert Brooke, but I have remembered it and I will now recite. "These things I have loved. White plates and cups, clean-gleaming." I can identify with those lines. I washed all the damn cups. [laughter] Uh, if you want the further recitations of Michael Delaney, follow me. Let's see, where was I? Gleaming cups and.. Oh, yes. "Ringed with blue lines. "And feathery, faery dust. "Wet roofs, underneath the lamp-light. [both] "The strong crust of friendly bread. "With many tasting food. "Rainbows and blue bitter smoke of wood." Oh, stop it you two. Has anybody told you that there is no love over 40, only death and taxes. - "The Great Lover." - Who? Michael? No, that's the name of the poem. He's a great dishwasher. But, Michael, did you really take such a grungy job? Yeah, did at will. But I know how he was. The old man was too uptight. - Huh, Michael? - No. Too dead. Uh, I'll get more ice. Pat? 'Oh, hey. Right, I almost forgot.' - More congratulations. - For what? Well, now that the hush-hush secrecy is over, we have the fruits of the labor of your think tank operation. You should be very proud of that 'fire-proof installation you've developed.' It was a group efforts. Hey, would somebody translate that into English? Well, Michael's aid had a group of physicist while 'we're working on the space program came up with an' incredible aid to home safety. That's very impressive. Now, I better go impress my wife. [indistinct chattering] [gasps] Oh.. Oh, how beautiful. Allcrystal. For the crystal boutique. Oh, it is so delicate, I.. Thank you. Thank you all of you. Oh, look what Michael gave me. Oh, wow.. Michael. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Uh-oh. - Oh-oh. [clears throat] I thought you were told to go to bed. How come I'm not in any of those pictures? - Uh, ask your daddy. - Yeah, how come? Ask your mommy. Um...because, because you hadn't happened yet. But you were on our minds. Scoot. Get up there. [Jack] Oh...nice shot. He's feeling very well today, isn't he? Yes, he is. Thank you. Great shot, Delaney. I hate you. Reward time. [Jack] 'Come on.' Take it easy, Michael. It's only a game. Hit it again, Michael. I admire your patience with that, Pat. Anything to stop smoking. Maybe I should get Jack to take it up, he might be better at it. May be they should both take up needlework. [chuckles] Can't you see that? But don't laugh, a lot of macho athletes are taking it up. Did you know I had an uncle in Bangor who weaves the most magnificent rugs. [chuckles] We call him a 90 roll hooker. [laughs] Oh, Pat. Mummy, when do I get my lesson? Oh, your daddy is almost finished, sweetheart. Why don't you sit down and wait. It won't be long. Good point, Michael. I love you, Jack, even if you loose. Forty love again. [Jack] 'Come on, Michael, it's set point. Get it over with.' Yeah, daddy. [racket clanks] I will deal...with you later. Come on, Delaney. Trouble is, Michael, the day that Lockheed blew its cover your whole industry is suspect. You're my association lawyer? You should know better than that. Now, wait, what-what makes your precious.. ...Powerwell Aerodynamics different? I mean, you know, don't kid yourself. - There are all enterprise. - Have some more vodka, please. How else are they're gonna sell planes, right? We lost the contract, so that proves we are clean besides, I'm not into sales. - Hey, Michael. - Yeah. What do you do over there these days now there is no more space program? Play chess with the computer. Well, move your drinks to shay Delaney. [crickets chirping] Oh, boy, everything's.. Everybody. Where are you? [indistinct chattering] I don't know how your science wiz does it but I got to be in court 8:30 in the morning. Healthy living and clean thinking. - Clean thinking. - Hey, watch it, Mike, watch it. Hey, hey, I'm sorry. - Goodnight, Margie. - I'm sorry. Hey, I'm sorry. ♪ The night is young and.. ♪♪ - You are so beautiful. - To be continued next week. - Goodnight, darling. - Goodnight. - Thanks for coming by. - Goodnight. [door closes] Why does the party always has to be at our house? You want to wrestle? No. I'll let you win. You just gonna lie there all night? - Not alone. - No, Michael. [laughs] "I...have been so great.. "...a lover. "Filled my days so proudly with a splendor "of love's praise. "The pain.. "...and the calm.. "...the astonishment.. "...desire.. "...illimitable. - Michael? - And still content." - Is everything alright with us? - Hmm. [indistinct] The aerospace.. ...in this field by Michael Delaney. Nuts and bolts. Nuts and bolts. Nutsandbolts. [laughs] Where a man works.. ...he lends to cut throats. I love you, Michael. You are...all I need. I don't even need this house. Oh. This house and all the things that go with it. Sometimes I think we went in too deep. You know, we built the pool, we haven't even finished doing it-- I worked for everything ...in this house. Thingsare not important to me. Youare important to me. - Nothing things. - But. There is a but, isn't it? [laughs] No buts. I guess I just.. I just miss the easy life we had once. Whatever you want, I want. I want you. [dog barks] Hey, dummy. Not like that. - This knife is no good. - You know what your daddy says? "If at first don't succeed, eat with your fingers." - Hi, dad. - Hello. - Hi, dad. - Eat. Daddy's right. Eat. Rough day? How can you tell? By the thud, thud, thud, of your briefcase. Reward time. - Daddy did you bring it home? - Did I bring what home? - You know. - Are you teasing, daddy. - Teasing about what? - I bet he hid it. - Is it here? - No, you're cold. - Am I warm? - No, you're cold, he's tapping. - What's tapping? - Look it up in the dictionary. It rhymes with oven. It's in the oven. That is a top secret design of your daddy's work. Really a top secret? Well, now that the government's making 'em I guess that secret can be shared with members of the immediate family. If they can be trusted. I can be trusted, honest. - Are your rooms together? - Sort of. - Sort of? - Yeah. Out. Out. You gonna get fat. I'll cut out the olives. [instrumental music] Daddy, I'm not sleepy. Out. You know, this is mummy and daddy's private time. Aren't you gonna count? 'Come on, daddy. Please count for me.' Ten, nine, eight, seven, six five, four, three, two...one. - I love you. - Thank you. Go on. [sighs] - 'Cause you're a genius. - Hmm. You've such patience and skill at getting those boys to do precisely what you want them to do. Thank you. And how come when I count, I get nothing. Because, you don't count backwards. For instance, seven, six. - M-Michael. - Hmm. - The stew is ready. - Well, let it stew. [chuckles] We got to eat. Do you love me? You...are loved. Am I? [Margie] My love? You're like.. ...this bird. You're fragile and delicate and.. Yes, I'm like glass. Easily broken. Not easily broken? Just.. That you must be.. ...gently handled. Gently handled. Just love me. - Here's some butter.. - Anymore juice? Here. Finish that one. Eww. This orange juice tastes weird. 'Really weird.' That's daddy's glass. What's in your juice, dad? Your daddy made a mistake. Yes, son, I made a mistake, I should have put the vodka in the cereal, instead I put the vodka in the orange juice and then I'll put the orange juice in the vodka and instead. 'And see if the cereal will speak.' Michael. Snap, crackle in here. [laughs] Dad, I got a problem. - 'Could you help me please?' - What's your problem, son? Well, it's my math homework. I couldn't finish it. How long before you have to go to school? About 15 minutes. Well, let's get to it? Finish your cereal. [instrumental music] Cindy? Mrs. Delaney. I came by to surprise my husband and take him to lunch but...seems the surprise is on me. Uh, they didn't tell me they moved his office. Where is he? He was fired. [dramatic music] When? Two weeks ago. He made me promise not to tell you. 'He said if...if you called I was always to say' he was out or at a meeting. I didn't want to do it. I'm not good at lying. Oh, no, he always said you were loyal. You did the right thing. He said he'd tell you when he found the right moment. 'Please don't tell him I told you.' - I won't. - Look, I'm so sorry. I really loved working for him. He was so terrific. He...made me laugh all the time. Well, don't talk about him in the past tense. He is not dead, you know. Thank you so much. Bye, Mrs. Delaney. [music continues] [car approaching] [car door slams] [door opens] Reward time? How was your day? Well, it was your average.. Oh, not the okay type of day. - How are the boys? - Under control. No countdowns? Just one. [instrumental music] May I make you a drink? [instrumental music] The pool is absolutely marvelous, Michael. Well, they've cost me a lot.. [Jack] 'Then the guy has the nerve to complain about a big fees.' Fees? Fees? 'Let me hear about fees, lawyers.' I want to hear about me, what kind of fee.. Um, Michael, i-it's late. I think it's about time we-- Shut up. Hold that! Geez, hold it a minute. What do you say to all of these poor suckers. They come to you and say-- - Look, Mike-- - Hey, hold it, Mr. Lawyer. Mr. Lawyer save me. - Michael, will you knock it.. - Getting very late. Let's go. It's getting late. Let's go. Come on. Do you have to get up in the morning? - You have to go to work? - Michael. No, no. Do you have to go to work? Well, Mr. Delaney goes to work. Mrs. Delaney doesn't go to work, does Mrs. Delaney? Now, Mr. Delaney paid for the house. - Mr. Delaney paid for the pool. - Yes. Mr. Delaney paid for all that, didn't Mr. Delaney? - Yes, yes. - Yes, Michael. Yes, Michael. - So, say it again. - Yes! Have a drink, Mrs. Delaney. [dramatic music] [coughs] You want some orange juice? No. Nothing in it. Promise. And I, uh.. ...gave the boys breakfast, send 'em off to school. The kitchen is, very neat and very clean. I sent your...blouse and slacks to the cleaner. He came by early. Thanks. Here. Uh, that blouse and, uh.. ...your slacks were in terrible shape. Well, you must've had a hell of a time last night. Who was he? You don't remember, do you? Not really. But unfortunately...happened. Morris called this morning and filled me in on the details. I'm sorry. I'm truly sorry. I know you are. Well, to show you how sorry I am I'll take the day off and we'll go to the beach. Michael.. I'm a lousy liar. Well, they fired me, Marge. They dumped me. Let me go. Why didn't you tell me? I didn't wanna hurt you. I'm just trying to protect you. Everyday I left you, I thought I'd come home and be able to say "Hey, kid, there's good news and bad news. The good news-- Yeah, but why? You're too good. It couldn't have been your work. Not my work. It's any work. They fired the entire research team and now [indistinct] is into the exclusive selling of...farm machinery. I don't understand. I just don't understand. Well, I'm relieved. You know what it's like going to work everyday for two years? I think you do. You know...we used to.. ...used to just sit around and...think of hypothetical problems for the... for the computer to solve. Keeps from going crazy. 'The handwriting was on the wall.' That doesn't matter. I love you. That's what matters. I'm your best friend in the world. I'm your best friend too. But don't ever do that again. 'No more secrets.' No more secrets. Just don't leave me. Never. Never. [dramatic music] Marge! Marge! Yeah. A toast. To honesty. "Here's to you as good as you are. "Here's to me as bad as I am. '"But as good as you are and as bad as I am..' ...I'm as good as you are." It's an old Irish saying. [Kerry] 'Leave me alone.' Okay, okay. Settle down. It's only the zoo. Why? Daddy has to get up. Give him a couple more minutes, okay? Did you pack the potato chips, mom? And the coleslaw. Mom, why do we need all that junk for? We can get hot dogs at the zoo. You can also get ptomaine poisoning. - Yeah, I like picnics. - So do I. How come daddy can take day off from work? Special holiday for him too? Now, why would your daddy want to go to work when he can take his two favorite fellas to the zoo? Yeah, I'm gonna wake him up. No, I'll do it. You pack the car. [both] I don't want any coleslaw! Pack the car. Michael, aren't you up yet? Go away. It's past 11:00. The kids are waiting. Come on. - Go away. - Get up, Michael. Go away. We promised the kids the zoo. Now, come on. Get up. I'm not going to any zoo. Now, get out! You're a terrific father! He's not going, is he? No. He's not. I knew it! I just knew it! Dan.. [door slams shut] [dramatic music] Good evening, America. Once again, I'm speaking in behalf of John Q Public who's getting sick and tired of listening 'to the would-be crusaders' about the downfall of the world's greatest diplomacy.. [Michael] 'Go on.' 'America is as great, if not greater than it has always..' What's so great about it? 'Get off my set!' 'Sit on your own assets, buddy.' Shut up! [glass breaking] 'When has there ever been so keen an interest' 'in the part of the government' 'to create new jobs and programs' 'for the betterment of the people?' 'Where else on Earth can a man or woman reach for the stars' 'and come back with a piece of the moon?' 'We must carry on and pass down to our children' 'the essence of our American Dream' 'so that this dream does not become the nightmare..' Ah, shut up! [glass shatters] [grunting] That's good. [dramatic music] [Michael] 'Where were ya?' I went out for a while. I brought you some flowers. Flowers for me. La-di-da. - Michael. - Mm-mm. We can't go on like this. We're eating up all our saving. Well, we have my...stocks. 'And we have my...trustees, baby.' So what are you worried about? You haven't looked for a job in weeks. Why, Michael? 'Cause I ain't gonna jump at the first thing and everything's below my level. Then take something lower. Can't you take something lower? I've worked.. ...for the PhD.. ...after my name! No doctor...is gonna take no for a job. Well, I'm not that particular. I'm gonna get a job. Here's to women's liberation. Is isn't that. We need the money. Besides, I'll get out of your way and maybe that will clear the air a little bit. They're dying for literature majors out there. I'm not stupid, Michael. I can find something. No wife...of mine ...is going to work! And nor, obviously, is any husband of mine! Oh! Hey, Marge. Margie. Margie. Marge. Marge. Hey, I didn't mean it, I.. Damn it! Get out of the kitchen! I just want you to forgive me. Will you forgive me? Get out! Listen, I didn't hit you that hard. I didn't, I've never hit you before. Michael. Oh, Michael. Don't you dare.. You can't get a job because you drink and you drink because you can't get a job. 'I don't know if you know what you're doing to yourself.' Please, let me help you. Just want you to forgive me. Will you just forgive me? That's all I want. I want you to forgive me. I forgive you. You're not the first man in the world who ever lost...a job. Not the job, or money.. It's my life. My life. There'll be, there'll be other space contract. Sure. Next decade! Next century! 'Cause people are tired of watching space rhapsodies they see it on television. You can find something. And you'd-- - Just like that! - Yes, yes. Men are changing careers all the time. You can too. Go back to college for seven years and become a lawyer? Oh, Michael. You're so good at so ...at so many things. You can find something. I'll think of something. Bad news. Kevin Brian's father is on vacation in Tucson, Arizona, for two months and Mrs. Brian regrets that he will have to cancel his Career day appearance.. Oh, too bad. Find me another actor. Ha-ha. Try Robert Redford. I'd loved too. Poor Pat. Always volunteering every year for Career Day. Didn't your mommy ever teach you to say no? Excuse me. Yes, it's my mother's fault. How's Michael doing in real estate? Oh, well, it's only been two weeks but...he's doing fine. Knowing Michael, I'm sure he's running a class! He is something, isn't he? I have an idea. Wouldn't Dan be delighted to see Michael standing in front of his class? You mean Michael give the Career Day speech? One scientist daddy coming up. He knows more about it than anybody. Well, I could ask him. He might. [door opens] Michael? He isn't here. What happened? Class break up early? What class? Suppose you tell me. Well, if it's Tuesday.. ...then it must be.. ...escrows. And escrows...are boring. Enough to drive a man to drink? Real estate ain't my bag, lady. 'I went to two sessions' and my PhD began to show. The people depress me. The professors depress me. 'And you're beginning to depress me.' Michael, what are you trying to tell me? Trying to tell you that the teacher picked on me. So I quit. You quit! Where have you been these nights? Wouldn't you like to know! Why, in God's name are you doing this? Michael! Michael! When are you gonna face.. ...what you're doing to yourself? You saw what happened to your mother? She died a drunk. She made your life miserable. And now you're making our lives miserable. Because you're just like she was. A selfish, weak drunk. Don't you ever.. Mommy. Hey, kid. Mommy and I are just fooling around, right? We're just fooling around. Come on, dad'll, uh, tell you a bedtime story. And so when the, uh, prince found out, he said to all those crazy people and all those people with long beards and dirty clothes "You're not gonna take my kingdom away because nobody takes my kingdom away." Hurray, prince! And so then he went and he got a gun and he got a-a-a cannon and so he killed everybody. - Everybody? - Everybody, just...like that! And then...he walked.. ...on their dead bodies. Then he made a speech. He said.. He said, uh.. "Nobody...takes my kingdom away "and nobody, uh.. "...does that to me because I've worked.. "...all my life. "So what I thought was.. "...right. And worked all my life for.." [grunts] Aah! [Michael groaning] This is an emergency. Uh, my husband is having convulsions. I'm Mrs., um. Mrs. Michael Delaney, 435.. [groaning] 'How soon can you be here?' [Michael coughs] Damn it! I said this is an emergency! Thank you. Hurry. [Dan] 'Mama.' What's the matter? Nothing. Nothing. Kerry's scared. 'He's crying.' Tell him to go back to bed. You daddy is alright. Go tell him, honey. [Michael panting] [dramatic music] How is he? If this is the first time, it might scare him. He needs watching. Sedation, vitamins. Call your family doctor as soon as possible. 'He will know how to handle the DTs.' Thank you, for getting here as soon as you did. I...appreciate it very much. He's a...he's a very good person. - He's worth helping. - 'I'm sure he is.' 'Goodnight.' [dramatic music] [engine turns over] The name's Michael Delaney, folks. And I'm not a joiner. Clubs.. ...are for the weak. That is why they call them.. ...anonymous. There is gamblers anonymous. There is facts anonymous. Then child abuse, I don't think child abusers have a club. Let's see what else. Anonymous, anonymous. Yes, we have sewing circles. Yes. Knitters Anonymous. You wanna drink, they come over and sew up your bottles. 'How about wives anonymous?' 'You're tired of the one you got you call alcoholics' 'they send you another one...hopefully.' Why don't you sign me up for a knitting circle? Lay off, will you? Call it knitters anonymous. You like taking a drape, somebody comes over and knits with ya. I am going out. What for? For your birthday party. Happy birthday, damn you! [door closes] [all] Happy Birthday! Make a wish, daddy. Hey, well, I wish for this face to blow out this messy candles. [laughing] Bravo! You go get the ice-cream. - Okay. - Hurry up. Birthday cakes are a bore. Happy 42nd, old buddy. And here's to number 43, Michael. Well, don't count on it. My own daddy didn't make it to 43 so why should I, out of respect for dear old daddy? Please, Michael. It's only wine, sweetheart. Poor old dada, he worked so hard and he was so earnest, but he was poor, poor, poor! Not for the lack of trying. It wasn't the money. It was my mother's drinking problem that brought about 'the untimely death of dear old daddy.' Or was it.. ...his death that brought on.. ...mommy's drinking problem. I never did get it right. Uh, Ann, you wanna cut the cake? [Ann] 'Oh, yes.' How did your game go today, mommy? I-I got here too late to play. Your daddy's not feeling very well. When's he gonna be better? Is he still coming to my school tomorrow? He is coming. I've got it all set up. You and I are gonna be there to root for him. You sure he won't be ...sick tomorrow? I don't think so. Do you? Well, I guess not. "Alcohol-ism is a progressive.. "...disease.. '"...which, if not treated, drives its victims' "into an abyss of either insanity.. "...or death. "The family must adopt a sympathetic 'constructive attitude."' It's almost ten. I wanna start on time. Let's go. Umm.. "Constructive, sympathetic attitude, that is the key. "It will pay off dividends '"for alcoholics respond gratefully...to warmth..' '...and understanding."' You're ready? You look a little tired. Come on. Marjorie, Michael. Thank goodness you're here! Dan was upset that you miss the preliminary. Sorry, Pat, we were held up. We're in Room 207. - Where is the men's room? - Men's room? Um...it's down the hall, that way. And 207 is that way. [male #2] 'One of the tutor aspects of being a dentist' 'is that we spend our entire lives trying to make' 'our profession...obsolete.' 'I mean, the more advanced and definitive our research..' '...the fewer cavities, and the fewer the dentists.' 'But, setting aside this paradox..' Where's Michael? He's on. Uh, I'll go see. 'I mean, you couldn't hope to make a career as a dentist' 'and be careless about your own health.' 'The profession of dentistry is a dignified' 'and a worthwhile career, I think.' Michael? Children, our aircraft specialist is gonna be just a little bit late. Perhaps he had some engine trouble. 'So why don't we just skip ahead.' 'Um, I have some posters I'd like to show you.' 'Oh, here he is!' And now children, Dan Delaney's father, Mr. Michael Delaney. Everything you ever wanted to know about the aerospace industry and Mr. Delaney does know everything. Yeah, these are, uh.. ...well, they used to be, uh, rockets. You put a.. ...fire under there and they go up. A, uh, speech. "What I know about the aerospace industry by Michael Delaney." [laughter] The aerospace agency is, uh.. ...composed of, uh.. ...people who, uh.. ...fly, uh, rockets. And you, uh, go to school for about.. ...a 100 years. Give or take a year or two. [clanking] Uh, then you, uh.. ...marry the bosses daughter. Meet, uh.. ...an influential friend. And that's what I know about the.. ...aerospace agency. 'So, I thank you for you're time..' ...and now.. ...everybody go out and steal hubcaps or whatever you do. I hate you! I hate you! You heard my son. He hates me. 'And, uh..' And there goes my wife who ain't to fond of me either. And, uh.. Here go I. Not one of my best speeches. Dan. - Dan. Dan! - Margie. Margie! [clanking] [glass shatters] Where's the kid? What do you care.. ..about anything? [dramatic music] - Dan-- - It's okay, mom. You don't have to explain. Well, sweetheart.. I want you to know that he-- I know, mom. I just don't want you to.. I don't hate him, mom. 'Not really.' Well, as you get older.. ...Daniel, uh, you'll understand that-- 'Mom!' I don't hate him. But I don't like him either. I don't like the things he does. 'What he did today was awful.' But I don't hate him. Mom? Yes? What're we gonna do? I don't know. I don't know. Oye, ya lady! [footsteps approaching] Hi! - Where the hell have you been? - Who are these people? They're friends of mine. Want a sandwich? Haven't you done enough for one day? I'm making sandwiches for my friends. Maybe you would like to go out by yourself without my company. - Uh, the boy's asleep? - Huh? Where are the children? What do they look like? They are at the Morris'. Get these people, whoever they are, out of here! My friend.. Hey, who-who's she, old buddy? - Who are you? - Ha! I'm Lou. You're Lou? This is Marjorie. Eh, Sophie. Sophie, this is Marjorie. - Butter - Marjorie. - Butter! - Marjorie! Michael, I'm going to call the police. Mike! Goodbye, Butter. Who wants butter? [laughs] Sweetheart, where's Pat? They went to the movies. They told Dan and Johnny to babysit. - Is Dan asleep? - Yeah. What's the matter, Kerry? I wet the bed. Well, that's okay. A guy has to slip once in a while. - Where's Dan? - He's in the kitchen. I'll be right up. - Reward time! - Dan! What are you boys doing? Go upstairs, Dan. Johnny, go to bed. Can't tell you how sorry I am. It scares me, seeing him imitating us like that. Marjorie, they're not imitating us. Johnny would never have done that. He was just going along with Dan. I-I hate to ask this but.. Michael has some.. I mean.. Would it be alright if I stayed the night too? - Of course, you can stay. - Well, why, sure. Thank you. I-I appreciate it. I'm terribly sorry. Marge, you need help. Legal help. - Legal help? - Yeah. - Perhaps I could-- - Jack! You can't handle this. We're friends. - 'We're too involved in it.' - 'Wait a minute, Pat.' Marjorie, why don't you talk, about it? It'll make you feel better. 'Why don't we all sit down and talk about this?' Pat, as long as I'm going to be seeing a lawyer.. ...I'll save the tedious details for him. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'll go take care of my boys. Be a good girl, Mrs. Delaney. Cool it. Take the kids. Leave town for a while. Soon as my processor re-bags him, you're in business. I'll serve him with a restraining order. Immediate court action? That's when we hit him with the financial terms. It all sounds so cold. Relax, Mrs. Delaney. You'll get your legal separation. We're really gonna work on this bum! He's not a bum! He's an alcoholic. 'And another thing.' This isn't legal aid. My fee is $500. I don't move without a retainer. I don't think I like you, Mr. De Mora. But I guess you're all I can afford. You don't have to like me. Just hope I get the job done. I've endorsed this house on a check from Michael. He sold the last of our stocks. I'll send you the rest.. ...as soon as I find a job. Well, good luck. And remember.. ...get out of town. Fast! Hey, hold it, hold it. Alright! - Where are you going? - Get in the car, boys. No, wait, wait, wait. Come on. Come on. Where are you going? - Don't you-- - Nobody's leaving! - Run, run! - Come on. That's it. - Come here, John! - Get here! Run! Hurry up! We're just going for a couple of days. Until you get yourself straight. No. Give me that! Give me my purse, you can't. You can't! Don't! Don't you dare! For once.. Margie. Margie. Stop fooling with that thing. It's broken. You'll only let in more hot air. - I'm boiling! - Well, that makes two of us. Gary! Put your seat belt back on! Daddy's gonna miss us. Yeah. He's probably too drunk to care. Dan.. Now your daddy is a very sick man. He doesn't mean to do the things he does. You've got to understand that, do you? He wasn't like that before. No. He wasn't. He's very sick. But, why don't we stay home and take care of him? Because, because we need to let him have some time alone. I am not doing this to punish him. But, who's gonna take care of him? Well, you're daddy's a big boy. He'll, he'll take care of himself. How do you know you can find a job? You've never worked before. Who, me? Talented Tilly? 'Yeah.' Well, I raised you fellas. That makes me a genius! Read some more of those ads. This one sounds like you. "Wanted girl.. "...A-1 personality, good legs, no nudity. Learn latest dance steps." Who thinks I'm a great dancer? - 'Not me.' - Not me. You got good legs though. I brain washed you pretty good. [metal clanking] Uh, lady, that transmission's shot. Now I can fix it for you for about 300? Three hundred? Well, we're high but we're here. Well, I don't have $300. That's your problem, lady. Yeah, I know. Can I leave it here a couple of days? - See if I can come up with it? - Sure. You better put up a sale sign on it in case I don't. You got it. Um, oh, boys, will you get our stuff outta the car? Well, lady, you need a place to stay? Without a car, I sure do. You go on up the road, The Embassy Motor Courts. - Clean, low rates. - The Embassy? And tell him Roy Jessup sent you. He'll give you a real low rate. Roy? I'll see you around, honey. You've got my keys. [instrumental music] Come on. Here we go. Might as well unpack. Haven't you served him yet? [De Mora] 'Oh, he's fast on his feet.' He's been on a real toot since you left, Mrs. Delaney. Smashed a couple of windows. I hear your front yard looks like the city dump. 'You got a real PR job to do on your neighbors' 'when this is over.' Then find him. That's your job, Mr. De Mora. Not anymore, lady. That check you endorsed from your husband? It bounced. Wait! I'll get you the money. [phone beeps] Hey! What're you doin' home so early? I quit. They were pinching instead of tipping. What are you doing up so late? - We had a lot of homework, mom. - Uh-huh. I bet you were watching television, right? You'll haven't even taken your bath. Now get going. And I'm gonna check your homework. Two points for the desert. The shirts dry faster. I'm gonna look at your multiplication. [Dan] "A poem to my dad" by Dan Delaney. "I think we're losing you. And there's nothing I can do. "Don't you care anymore? "Can't you be my father anymore?' "I'm scared of all the stuff that you drink. "And the strange way you talk and think. "You make my mom sad and cry. "I think she's afraid you're gonna die. "Please don't leave us lonely and sad. "I don't wanna hide from you, dad. [knocks on door] - How're you doin'? - Hi. Hey, I'm right next door, I thought you might wanna come on over, have a drink with me. Nah, I got enough right here, thanks. Aw, come on. My kids don't like late parties. Sorry. Well, actually, I was thinking you and me. You want me to call the manager? Sure. I'm the manager. Oh.. I'll see you around. He busted the mans jaw! End of story, Mrs. Delaney. You're nowhere. 'That money you sent goes to pay for the hospital bill.' Please, you've got to try again. I can't stay away much longer. Sue me. Get me more money or forget it! [Pat] 'Where are you?' 'And the boy's are with you?' Just hold on. Jack is here. It's Marjorie. She needs money from us. - Hello, Marjorie. - It's not for me, Jack. It's the lawyer. He won't move. He's sitting on his hands. I thought maybe you can help me. Marjorie, as a friend I'm naturally concerned about you and the boys. You know that. But I can't mix in. Michael is violent. 'He was here last night. He threatened me.' 'Insisted I knew where you were.' 'I had to call the police.' 'It's a mess.' Look. It's not the money. Try to understand. I have my family to protect. Thank you, Jack. Hey, Ma! Where are you going? 'Don't answer the door for anybody.' Don't talk! Now, you just listen.. Michael, do you hear me? Don't do this to me anymore. I want you to stop this. 'I.. Are you listening?' - Margie. - 'Michael!' Stop. Stop. Please. I've stopped. I am not drunk. I haven't had a drink. 'Are you listening?' Yes. I'm listening. Let's see a psychiatrist, a Dr. Lazerow. I want you to come home. I miss you so terribly, darling. I miss you. Me too. [sobbing] - What's the matter? - 'Nothing.' Come on, tell me. I'm just scared. Don't be. Mom's gonna take care of us. Now go back to sleep. - Dan? - What? I wet the bed again. Come on. Let's change the sheet before mom gets back. Boys? We're goin' home. Mr. Delaney, would you excuse us for a few moments? Before I see your husband alone there's something I'd like to say to you. I feel you were very brave in coming back to your husband, Mrs. Delaney. 'It's not your duty to stay with Michael.' 'With two young children, it might even be' 'terribly destructive.' He's a desperately ill man. 'I can't force him to go to AA.' 'I'll do my best to work with him.' Will have to be at least three time a week. I see. Is there anything I could be doing? I'll have to spend some time with him first before I can answer that. - Alright. - Alright. Mr. Delaney, will you come in now, please? How did it go? Swimmingly. I'm so glad you like Dr. Lazerow. Yeah, he's a nice man with a tall order. [instrumental "Jingle Bells"] Hello, Pat! Marge! - I.. - Would you like to taste? 'It's delicious.' It's wine flavored. You'll love it. I.. Sir? Would you like to taste? Thank you. Nice to see you again, Pat. Happy New Year, Frank! Mr. Delaney, just a minute, please. - Mr. Delaney? - What is it, Frank? - Mr. Delaney, just a minute. - What do you want? I'm sorry. I can't let you use the courts today. Hey, listen. I didn't make a reservation. It's alright. There ain't that many people out there. I'm sorry, those are my orders. Hey! You don't give orders! Me Tarzan, you're a hired help. Mr. Delaney, just a minute. Mr. Delaney. Oh! I'm sorry, Mr. Delaney. Dad? Dad? Are you okay? Go away. 'Please, go away!' [water splashing] Hey, um. Hey, kids! Hey! Danny, Kerry, come here. I wanna talk to you. Dad wants to talk to ya. Come on. Put a towel on ya. You'll catch a cold. Come here, baby. Daddy.. ...is gonna make a New Years resolution. What's a resolution, daddy? Uh, well, it means that your father is going to try to.. What your father is going to do in the new year. There will be no more of that funny old.. There will be no more, uh, misunderstandings between mommy and me. 'Because I love your mother and she loves me.' 'And we love the both of you.' So, it's going to be a happy new year for all of us, right? - Okay? - Okay, daddy. Okay. - Okay. - Okay. [instrumental music] - Happy New Year. - Happy New Year. To a very happy New Year. Thank you. At least we've got the bubbles. At least we have the bubbles. - I like it. - You like what? - Just the two of us. - Me too. Alright, I will spread the cheese. And you pop the cork.. ...on a brand new vintage bottle of ginger ale. I don't think there is anymore. Michael Delaney to the rescue. - 'Where are you going?' - Don't go away. That old chuck every year. A bottle of cheap wine. Ah, Michael, I don't think that we should. It is only wine, darling. They serve it in church. It never hurt anyone. Wine. [bottle clanking] - Where are you goin'? - I'm going to get some more. Not without me? You always said I couldn't keep up with you. But I'm gonna try. [Margie] 'You're not making any sense!' 'Dollars, my dear, not sense. I want that check from the club.' 'They do not want me as a member till they owe me a refund.' 'They said they put it in the mail.' - Where is the check? - What are you talking about? - Talking about the check. - What check? Where is it? Nobody check.. What? I swear. Why would I hide it? We're deep in debt as it is. Everything we have is pawned. If I had it, you think I'd give it to you, you stinking drunk! 'You stinking drunk!' Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Get out! Get out! Get out! Get outta here! And stay out! - Good morning, boys. - We made our own breakfast. Good for you. - Daddy was here. - He left. Dan. There was a check in here. He took it. [dramatic music] Okay, come here, Delaney, let's go. I can't thank you enough. That's okay, lady. I've been there myself. Come on. [exhales] I don't wanted to do that.. Shh. No, I know, I don't want to do it. I'm just tired. Tired of the.. [mumbling] [gasping] Mike. Oh. Mike. I don't, I don't care. I didn't wanted to do.. No one. Sit up! Sit up! Sit up! I'll-I'll hold you. You'll sit up, if I have to hold you all night. I'm sorry, Mrs. Delaney. Perhaps I was remiss. I should've called you. Michael only showed up for two sessions. And he always said how well it was going. He even...he even said he was one of your best patients. That's typical of Michael. See he feels that he's more superior than the world thinks he is. Well, he's, uh, an extremely bright man. He's really gifted. The fact is...he feels terribly inadequate. - Michael? - Yes. And he's a perfectionist. That's an unbearable condition with no solution. Have I failed him? In Michael's head the world has failed him. 'And he cannot tolerate an imperfect world.' You must face a terrible truth, Mrs. Delaney. Michael wants to die. 'He will die.' 'Smash up, suicide' or if he's really unlucky later from starvation. Now, this might sound cruel but it must be said. First his liver will cease to function. His nose will hemorrhage. The vessels of his stomach fill explode. From what you've told me of his poor tortured body the process has already begun. I feel you should institutionalize him. There's nothing more you can do at home to help him. He's in a very bad way, Mrs. Delaney. I think you better come and get him. Yes, ma'am, I will. [telephone rings] Mr. Romero? If your husband has property legal aid can't be involved. I am sorry. You have to convince him to sell the house. See that it's sold, your lawyer 'will go after the money, I assure you.' I can't wait. That takes months. I-I'm afraid for my children. I have to have legal protection. There are lot of truly unfortunate people waiting to see me, Mrs. Delaney. I am sorry. 'That's the reality of the situation.' I have no money. But your husband owns property. There's nothing I can do. Hey. [coughing] Margie! Margie! [instrumental music] - 'You'll really like it.' - 'Thanks again.' Oh, don't forget you napkin. Too bad we're losing you, Margie. It's a real break for you. You really moved up fast. That's me onwards and upwards just like the food crisis, Joe. Charge it. Michael, be reasonable. - At least listen to me. - 'No hospital.' Let me in and let me talk to you about it. 'I don't wanna talk to you?' 'I don't wanna talk about any hospital.' [Dr. Lazerow] 'I know a man who does this kind of job, I'll set it up.' 'They'll come and get him.' Isn't, uh, tomorrow a little too soon? 'No, the sooner the better.' Alright. Only, uh, could you please have them come while the children are at school? [male #1] 'Of course.' Thank you. Where you going? - Outside. - Relax. [grunting] [panting] Oh, God. [siren blaring] [tires screeching] Do you have to put that on him? He's out cold. This is procedure, ma'am. When they first come around they can be difficult. 'Will you be riding in the back with us?' Oh, no. I'll follow. [dramatic music] [indistinct chatter] Boys. Uh, why don't you sit down for a minute? Before you go out and play I want to talk to you. Well, mom, what's the matter? It's something very important you both should know. It's about dad, isn't it? Yes. It's about your daddy. Where is he? When a person drinks he doesn't always drink because he wants to. Sometimes there's something bothering him. 'And he has to drink.' Where do you go when you break your leg? You go to the doctor or the hospital. [Margie] 'Yeah.' 'You go to the hospital.' Your daddy went to the hospital today. We're gonna help him. So he doesn't get drunk anymore. Don't ever say that about your father. 'He has a problem and he's trying to help himself' and while we're in this house we will respect him. Now go on out and play. [barking] [birds chirping] Here. You were there only 30 days. That's not enough time. Why did they release you? Good behavior. Not one visit from my faithful wife. I thought you'd be better off without me. I thought you'd get better faster. I was constantly in touch with the staff. I didn't even get a packet or a piece of cheese, you get that free. If they ever gave me the slightest idea they were letting you go. [Michael] 'Gone but not forgotten.' I'm on the other system. I report to the Yoho locals once a week. Is that fair? No, it's inexcusable. They had no right. You're drinking already. They need the beds and I prefer my bed here. You have to go back, Michael. - It's too soon. - I am forgotten here. - But I'm not gone. - 'You need more time.' I'll go with you. I'll explain to the doctors. - You have to go back. - I'm staying here. I'm leaving here on Friday. Who gave you permission to sell this house? Your conservator. - Who's that? - Me. Michael, I did what I had to do. You were incapable of making decisions. Dr. Lazerow testified to that in court. 'I had a lawyer such as he was.' The house was sold at a good price. It's a seller's market. I went to real estate school and you became the authority. I put your share of the money in trust. Tough roar, Margie. Tough roar, Margie. I have to finish packing tonight. I don't want any trouble, Michael. I won't give you any trouble. [honking] [Michael] 'Hello..' [honking] [Michael] 'Hey, you..' '...wake up.' The home wrecker. 'Come on, I wanna introduce you to the next' 'Mrs. Delaney.' Mrs. Delaney. [laughing] Hey! Hey! 'Are you up there?' [dogs barking] 'Nice work.' [laughing] [Michael] 'Hey, you, wake up.' Someday, my dear. Oh, uh. [laughing] Well, forever yours. Goodbye, slut. [laughing] 'Goodbye!' [dogs barking] Come on, just you and me, baby. Let's get the hell outta here. Come on. Ah, I don't need this. [laughing] [honking] Goodbye, slut! Swindler, home-stealer! [dogs barking] [honking] [engine revving] I want my house back! You, slut! It's still my house. Margie. [mumbles] [telephone rings] Yes. [Rachel] 'Mrs. Delaney, this is Rachel.' 'I'm Michael's friend.' Yes. 'He's in the hospital.' 'He's dying.' 'Can you come?' Margie. I'm here, darling. I have been so great in love with you. Filled my days so proudly. The pain. 'The calm.' The contempt. I loved you. 'No.' Michael. [sobbing] Oh, Michael. Oh, God. Oh, Michael.
