subtitles by rubinmusicbox Â® A two day police search has ended with the discovery of a man's body at the bottom of a cliff on one of the islands remote beaches. Authorities have not released the man's name but it is believed, he was a detainee in the offshore facility on Christmas Island, for more than five years. The department of border control says service providers staff have reported what they called, an illegal maritime arrival escaping the centre early on Saturday morning. The department confirmed the man's death on Sunday evening and said the matter is now being investigated by the Coroner. Reporting for Nation Australian radio. - The sand that we use in the boxes... it's what we consider to be the smallest particles of earth. You imagine that every grain of sand that we see you know, used to be part of rocks, mountains, formations and now they're down into their finest form. - How does the sand feel, is it cool or warm? Yeah? I think it's, it's, it's, like cold. - Cold. Yeah. - Does it feel soft or hard or sharp or gentle? It feels... I like the sound, you know. - The sound Yeah, because I guess the sound you know it reminds me of the waves. -Hmmm Yeah. I think. - Go with your feeling. - Go with your feeling. - and that doesn't mean you have to keep moving. - If you feel like that's enough, then that's enough. - But if there's a another feeling like that you're drawn to, try to follow it. - Hmm. - What do you notice as you look at your picture? Hmm. - What do you notice? I think this is the life that we left behind. - Hmm. - When you look at this picture, all of it. - Does it feel complete for you? - Or is there something missing or is something in the wrong place. - Have a good look. - Park Space, this is Parks Two. Do you receive? Hey Parks Two, do you copy? - Can you give us an update at Ethel beach mate? Inaudible - Alright thank you. On your way back can you do the red sign and just put on Ethel is closed.Thank you. Copy that. Wow. - Mama crabs. Yeah mama alright. You can tell like. This one here carries a lot more than the other ones. Come here. - They're so much smaller. Smaller, but see how big they are? Yeah, I say another day or two..tomorrow. Look at this mom as well. You see they can't cross the road. Umm. We need to find something so that they can cross. Maybe if we look around for some Timber or whatever. Ahh, so they can cross across it. So, make a bridge. Make a bridge for them. Otherwise they're not going to get across. Watch out crabby. Just put it anywhere. We're making a bridge for them. Oh no. They're so fast when they're little. -Yeah. - We just, as much as we want to do we're just helping them out that's all. Poppy must be tired she's still asleep. Yeah. Good morning. - Look at the mommy. - Mamma, look at the mummy. Hmmm. - Look. - Mummy. - What's the mummy doing? Working. - Working. Yep. - Just like your mommy. I think Pappas coming. Quick. Why? He won't see us. Oh no, my foots out the bottom, ahhh. Just like me. I can't get my foot in. 'We can turn there.' 'We can't camp next to the Detention Center.' 'Why?' 'We're not allowed to.' 'Oh.' 'Yeah.' 'Why?' 'The Detention Centre has people that guard the gates because people that are staying in there are not allowed to come out.' 'They can't come out.' 'No. Not unless the guards say they can.' 'Oh.' 'How minutes you can stay?' 'What do you mean?' 'How many minutes?' 'Can the people stay? Sometimes they stay for a couple of months. Other times, for years.' 'Years?' 'Yeah.' Good thing we wore jeans. Yep. Lets hop on the mountain. See if we can find any pumpkins Alby. - What's happened to the world famous pumpkin hunter? - Just too early for them. - No there's one hiding here. I'm sure of it. - Very gently and slowly Alby. - Do you know this could be almost 70 years old this crab. - It's like your granddad or your grandma. - Come on girls, let's go. Yeah, but we haven't had dinner yet darling. Can you imagine what these robber crabs have seen in their lifetime. Nope. Humans? Yeah, they saw the first people that arrived on the island. Well, if they're up to 100 years old, they'd have seen the first people. 'When you put your hands in the sand' it's to follow what feels right and to keep going with what feels good. If something doesn't feel okay that you stop for yourself. You don't wait for me to stop you. Yeah. - Okay. Does that make sense? - Yep. Yep. So, any questions so far. - What sort of sand it is? - This is sand from the beach. - Awesome. - Yeah, sand that I collected. - I don't know if you've ever been, out on Christmas Island. - But this is from Muriel Beach. Have you been to Muriel beach before? No. - No, it's a very very small Beach - and you can only get to it when the tide is out, when the water is out. Ahh okay, is this in Christmas Island, Muriel beach? -Yeah, yeah. Yeah... - So I collect it there, I wash it and, prepare it for the tray. - Hmmm. - Ok it's - like, in a, peaceful country. - So there's no fight. - Everything is okay and the community live there. They're secure and the country is secure. Hmmm. They can have this nature, grain and all the time because, in this country no one had a like no other problems, security problems. That's why it's nice and beautiful grew up everyday improving. But in a country is all the time fight like my country. I don't remember one day of peace in my country everyday everything happening. -You don't remember one day. No. -Of Peace Like, you know, every night news is not good. Like everyday innocent people get killed. And also the country goes like this no nature like it's all sand and the buildings destroyed and you know. So. The difference between this and this, is too much. Yeah. It's really hard for me, like I never been away, one lunch or... breakfast or dinner. I always, always at home, around family eat together, and you know. But now it's like it's like almost, nearly four years. Like like I didn't celebrate anything with them. It's a bit hard. Yeah, but it's good. I've got friends now. Keep me in touch and, spend time. Yeah. - I can just hear how precious, your family are to you. Hello. - Detention ops. Oh hello, it's umm, Poh Lin here. I'm one of the torture and trauma counsellors from the community hospital. How are you today? - Good thanks, how are you? Not too bad. I'm just calling we had some appointments for 10:30 but, it's now 10 to 11, and there's no sign of them. I just wondered if you could check on that for us. - Err yep, just a moment. Okay, thanks. - Okay. Errrr... No, there's no one listed here for that time sorry. No appointments? - No appointments. Right, ummm. Well we've definitely sent through the, the booking request and we had people, yesterday afternoon. So I'm not quite sure why, that's happening are they, are they on island still are you able to check that please. - Ah sorry no, I'm not able to check that. But if you could just let us know if they're on island or not so we can follow up. - I'm, I'm not actually allowed to give you that information sorry. Right okay? Have you heard from transport this morning? Has there been an issue? - I, I can't disclose any further information sorry. Okay, no worries. I'll umm, I'll give transport a call and a... check in with the HLO. And umm, yep try and find where they are. Thanks anyway. - OK. All right - No worries. Bye. - Thanks, bye. What is it in the rubbish? It's flags. It's what, uncle? They're burning some offerings. and what Uncle was saying before this is like, for the new year. So they make these offerings, so that the ghosts are happy and the ghosts don't go and bother other people. What is a ghost? Is a ghost the animal or the ghost is the... When a person dies the Chinese belief is that the ghost leaves the body, yeah. So it's like something you can't see but it's around us. Does that make sense? But I can't see any ghosts. No, we can't see them with our eyes. - Why? - Because they're no longer body. - They're no longer like you, like your body. - It's like, kind of like air or clouds or something. You okay babe? - What's wrong? Do you remember that boat, that went down last week. - At night, yeah. - Yeah, of course. There, was a young man Ahh, that I met today who, was on that boat. and umm... - He was talking about Like all those hours in darkness on the water. He managed to hold on to something that time. and umm... It was just the way that he described when the the first light was coming, like when they could first see what was happening. And like I think maybe what 32, or so, people drowned off that boat. He explained to me that As the light first came up, the water was still like like oil, it was, slick and dark. In fact, he didn't see the, the sharks, he he heard the people, their screams, as they were, taken. and I just sat there thinking like if I was in that situation, I don't know whether I would let go of the like let go and just sink, drown or whether like, you would wait for your turn, to see if the shark takes you or not. It was really hard to sit with that. I don't know, maybe he'll come back next week or maybe they'll move him. It's the usual, never knowing. You don't know if you've got one moment one conversation or two years of conversations. I'm exhausted. Not much you could do babe. - Roger, and clear, that's it for now. - I'll let you know when there's more, coming through. You got any more coming? Stop there by that one. - That's good, I'll let you know when I need ya. - Yeah alright. -Yep. I've got a car coming up mate in a minute so then I'll escort you through ok. Is that alright? So if you wanna just put it there, just go to the other side and I'll come with you. Hey boss boss, you copy. - Hold them there until the next ones - come through from the opposite direction. - There's some coming through now Esme will bring them through. - How is it, to talk to me today? - Yeah, I feel like even if I talk for a couple of days and constant. I wouldn't get empty. I feel like my inner.. is full of all those experiences, stories and bitter experiences. - Is it okay to ask a question? - I guess I'm curious about, as a mother and son. - Is there a way that you particularly look at each other? - Is there a way that you hold each other? - Do you sing, do you pray, what do you do together to experience connection even when the conditions around are so chaotic? - Yeah, yeah. - His character, he's a very kind and sensitive boy and he's very intelligent and smart as well and as a mom, by just holding and hugging him it was giving both sides comfort. - So that was something that you could give each other both ways. How old was Zane, when you first arrived? - It's ok ok. - As we've talked before it's not illegal to seek asylum. - And it's not acceptable to experience punishment for requesting safety and protection. It's ok. - Have you had any contact from anyone about them or they just have been no shows. - Well I did the normal, like I rang detention ops and they were like, it's an issue with transport so I rang transport and they said it's an issue with with detention operations and I sent through the list of names and boat ID numbers. - Yep. - and just got a really short email back saying cannot advise if they are or where they, are currently placed. Or on or off Island. -Yeah. -Yeah ok. - So. -So, it's gradually being reduced isn't it. All of our information. -Have you had any? Nothing, I just keep being referred to the policy, and the secrecy. - Privacy policy of Immigration. - At least two years ago, three years ago we felt we could make a difference. - I know it's now got to the point where we feel like we're just being here as a little prop for the immigration, tick their box. - I know it's incredibly hard to do worthy work. Yeah. And to ignore our recommendations week, after week, after week as we just have to watch someone just deteriorate and have no ability to prevent it. - I didn't think that I would ever work in a context where you, like.. you know, at least in other places as difficult as it was you could hope to see some improvement over time. I... It sounds awful, but sometimes it's hard to come in because I don't know that I want to see the people that I care about worse than the previous week. -Yeah. Lawyers and asylum seeker advocates are concerned about new laws that will apply from tomorrow affecting staff of immigration detention centres. Government contracted workers risk up to two years in jail if they disclose what they see. This new law effectively turns the Australian department of immigration into a secret security organisation with police powers. It will prevent anyone working in immigration detention centres that is international human rights bodies, doctors, teachers, councillors from raising concerns about asylum seekers about the conditions inside the facilities they could go to jail for up to 2 years. So, it will definitely have a chilling effect. You okay babe? Yep. I just thought of something. Alright. Where are we camping? Just there in the sun, at the bottom? Yeah, alright. How about, just here? - Sure. Well I kind of imagined a place where the girls could just scream too. With no, no limit. Well, I think you found that. 'The locals make their offerings to those who have died.' 'Those who have lost their lives in the island and the oceans surrounding.' 'The wandering spirits.' 'The hungry ghosts.' 'Those stuck between worlds.' 'Trapped between homes.' 'What offering will it take to free those Spirits, from uncertainty?' - It's alright. And as you say that to me You talk about having the two face that you show power to your family and when you said your mother met you even though she couldn't hop up she, smiled at you. Sounds like she was also -She was doing that. trying to protect you. Yeah. Is that what gets you through? School drives open. Yeah. Switch them round, yep. North West Point. Road is closed. Maddock Knoll, is that open? Aye, that's open. - Here? Yep. I'm going to put this by the side. Perfect. Does that make sense? Yep. We've put so many recommendations that he's not okay. He's not okay to be transferred. He needs to go the mainland. It happened the same today as well, it's.. Yeah. Only had one person come today. I love these people dearly, but I'm not prepared to be complicit in some way, with the system. Can't just keep propping someone up mentally forever, when there's complete uncertainty. You know like someone in prison has a sentence they have a time frame. They know when they're going to get out. But indefinite, like.. Can you imagine trying to get your head around no certainty? The day becomes the month, becomes the year, becomes the decade. When time is like that your whole mental faculties start to break down. It's the first place I've worked where even though you're doing really good therapy you're seeing them decline. You seeing them going from being fit and capable to, talking about suicide ideation. And they get this real deep desire to end their life. But I tell you what, when your life is the only thing that you have choice over in the end? You'd probably contemplate it too. Wow. Wow. Mama, are there crabs in the water? Not red crabs, no. Other crabs maybe. What like crabs? You know the ones you see on the rocks. No. Brown ones. Oh yeah brown. And they live in the water? Just on the rocks I think, but they can go under the water. - Do you want to go back? They're not in the waves? - It's rough today. - Come on, lets go. No, it's a... Mommy can't do, this work anymore. It's not possible. Why? Because umm I've reached a point where the people I want to help I can't anymore. Why? Ahh, there's lots of lots of things going on, but umm. But you know my job is about trying to help some people and if I can't do that then it's time for us to go somewhere else. -That's, Poppy and Albertine. Ok. Can we give that one, to the op shop? No. We can't take everything. I like that one and I keep it. And keep that bag and Albertine bag. Ok. So maybe we put the things up here that we're going to take. Are we taking this book or not? Yep. Yep.
