Negresco My profession: Photographer If I had only stayed with it. Always had jobs. Made ends meet, somehow. Fashion, advertising,... Did everything that paid. Spice it up, girls! Not so boring! Shake it, dammit. Money has always been my problem. Money and women. I've had enough women, and yet not enough. And money? Well, I've always had just small change in my hands. I wanted to get to the big money, to the large bills. This doesn't give it to me, not at all. You're driving me mad, c'mon. Yes, finally! I had one of those usual jobs: Three girls in a wind tunnel, hippie colours. I started shooting, disliking what I was doing. But that was the beginning. I have always shot with just the camera, I swear. And your murder weapon... shove it up your ass. It doesn't belong to me. Do you want to sell *this* prancing to the shareholders of Glanzstoff-Werke? You requested something lively for the old geezers to wake up. The geezers sell fabrics. They don't want to see others' breasts, but their own products. In short: the same old crap as ever. - What you do is old hat. - Too bad. So you employed the wrong man. - I'm realizing that, too. - Then I can go. - But you're paying the day anyway! - Don't worry. You can pick up your money this afternoon. Apparently, our photo models aren't enough for you. I don't know what you're talking about. - About her. She's barefoot up to her neck. - You better forget about these photos. - Because that is Laura Parrish? - That's none of your business. She's certainly showing off! I never thought that anyone here would know Laura Parrish. Wouldn't you have hung up the pictures otherwise? Why not? Frankly... because it's too dangerous. They are private pictures. - Did she want to seduce her husband? - Hardly. And it's none of your damn business. A millionaire's half-naked wife is always intriguing! Don't get your hopes. You'll have no luck with her. What others achieve, I will achieve all the more. If I may give you some advice: don't do anything stupid, having seen these pictures! That's a matter of honor. If I get my money this afternoon... I'm calling this off. It was a misunderstanding. I'll do the shooting myself. Get out of that storm, girls. I thought you'd be hanging around here. I'd like to tap your good memory. Yeah? By the way, you still owe me a thousand marks. What do you want to know? Tell me everything you know about Mr. Parrish and his wife Laura. They are filthy rich. I know that. How did they get there? Maybe I can get involved. Listen, Parrish is a very dangerous man of honor. He holds the world record in this field. And if I snag his wife? The gentleman will not voluntarily give away anything he once bought himself. Too bad. - That's how things are. - You couldn't hook up with her anyway. Well, it was just an idea. It was a stupid idea. But you've got to try to exploit anything. And if it won't work, it won't work. I went back to Berlinger's studio to pick up my day's pay. I wouldn't let him keep it. But Berlinger wasn't able to pay out money anymore. Something unexpected had happened. Berlinger was dead. Shot. And the photos of Laura Parrish were gone. "The shots are dangerous‚Äù, Berlinger had said. He was wrong. They were deadly. It's already 9 o'clock. Don't you have to get out today, or have you overslept? It's alright. I've got nothing to do today, and so I'm sleeping in. - Again? - I've only toiled yesterday. All day! Should I have gone to the police? Of course I should have. But at that time, I thought "Are you insane?" You know how the coppers are: There's a corpse, and someone who allegedly found him, etc... Well, and then Delloo called the next morning: I was supposed to fly to London with him. To do some coverage on wild strikes. And so I had an opportunity to disappear. What should I have told the police? Some wild story of disappeared bosom pics of an international business man's wife? They would be suspicious, for sure. And learning I had flown out, they'd have their suspect. They never catch the real perps anyway. Admittedly, everything looks even more suspect now. Thank you. Come on, hurry up. The plane is not waiting. Swinging London with strikes. Please go straight to passport control. Your machine is ready for takeoff. - Thank you. - Come on. - I'll do it. - Bring the luggage to the taxi. Alright. Hey, Roger! Berlinger had said I wouldn't get to her anyway. As I saw her there, it suddenly hit me. Delloo flew off without me. Now I wanted to find out. - Where to, please? - To the Hilton. Good afternoon! What an impudence! What is this? - We know each other. - Isn't this a little unimaginative? I do have imagination. My machine just flew off to London. You are crazy. Thank you very much. - Your husband has called twice, Mrs. Parrish. - Did he leave a message? I noted it down. - He'll be here tonight. Mr. Parrish arrives from Zurich. - Thank you. Hilton Hotel, reception. Yes, ma'am, he is already here... The man in the elevator was Charly. I did not know him then, of course, but I should see him again. I was damn naive. I've always underestimated Parrish. Charly is one of his men. I didn't seem to be mistaken about Laura. She was the type who participates. Quite nice here. What do you want from me? I do not know exactly. I do not know you well enough yet. Do you want an interview? - Tell me, what's your first name? - Laura. - Are you American? - No, my husband is American. - I'd like photograph you some time. - No. Too bad. - Reception. - Parrish. Is my wife already in the hotel? - Your wife arrived two hours ago, Mr. Parrish. - The operator said she had gone out. - Really? But I did not see Mrs. Parrish go away. - Has she deposited her room key? No, Mrs. Parrish has not deposited the key. - Call through again, will you? - I certainly will, just a second. - They're really persistent. - Why so nervous? Don't worry. - 20, oh no. - No, no. It's 12. Say, do you cheat on your husband often? No. I'd say: sometimes. - 30, rouge, pair, passe. Won't he come up here? - No. - I like that. - Now what about London? Let's not talk about it. The chance is missed. 33! - Mrs. Parrish, your husband tried several times to reach you! - Yeah, I know. Your taxi is waiting outside. Unpunctual as always. I see the affair was good for you. You gained from it. Berlinger is dead. This happens to people who know too much: they die prematurely. I want a divorce. Yet again? I principally keep what I possess. You know that. I can't go along anymore. It's over. Why so vigorously? A pity that you do not take me seriously. You have to relearn. - I'll take another whiskey, how about you? - I go. - Stay where you are! Believe me, your fear is reasonable. - I could kill him. - But he loves you. - Parrish loves only money. - I immediately book our flights. Not from here! We must leave no trace. Don't you exaggerate a bit? Believe me, I know him better than you. Are you not afraid? Well, alright. We'll meet at the airport, right? Yes, darling, hurry up! It was very foolish of you. Mr. Parrish is very annoyed about your departure, as you can imagine. - Leave me alone, Charly! - Why this risk? Call me later! - What did that fat guy want from you? - Why? I don't know him at all! To the Negresco, please. I used to sleep on the beach down there. Has been fun. At that time, I swore that I will live in the Negresco one day. - Now you've done it. - What I want, I can do it. You really are convinced of yourself! Good night, pleasant rest. Thank you very much. Thank you, dear. It is not much. I'll come up with something myself. Well then, take the rest. Yes. Yes, I think it's enough for a while. Just before departure, I had called Delloo. He was really furious. But curious as he is, he said: "I'll come. Let's see what's the deal with this story. " We had arranged to meet at a bar. I looked up from the dark vortex of my soul, and was 25,000 ft above the sea level. And I knew that I had lived a full life,... - ... and many other lives... - Do you need money? I can give you some. Hello fatty! You're punctual as an egg timer. We'll talk later. Too bad. I seem to interfere, too bad. Man, you got lucky. - What's the name the cutie? - Nadja. Not bad, the little one. Is she from London? Or a creature of the Cote d'Azur? Leave Nadja alone! - How, funny: You know each other? - Yes, I'm extremely sorry. - Get lost! - May I buy you something? - You got money? - Hell yeah. As I told you, I'm after a big thing. Impressed, aren't you, fatty. I live in the Negresco. - Okay. - Get lost, really quick. - Well, you bore me. One Pastis for the monsieur. Bring him a whole bottle. He shall live like a human being for once. I think we have planed something else, honey. And you, don't run away. It won't take long. I'll be right back. Sleep in peace, my children. Only love is true. What's the matter with you, my dear brother? Is it not God's will that you share this wonderful bottle of Pastis with me? - Why did you ditch him so easily? - Never mind. He was surely looking forward to this evening. Naturally, he wanted to sleep with you. - You do not? - But yes, with the greatest pleasure. Just not today. - Call me when you've got time, will you? - And where? - Well, in the Negresco. Where else? - Let's see. Maybe you'll think a bit of me when you're with Delloo. But do not forget. - Yeah, who's there? - Charly. - Are you crazy to call here? Berlinger could still be alive. Parrish had not given an order. - You have to do what I tell you. - You lied to me! - Parrish orders you to come to the Engadin. - Mind how you talk to me! 19 transverse pleine, and uh, the 27 and 30. - The 10 and 16. - The 10 and the 16. Rien ne va plus. No more bets. 13 noir impair manque - Now I don't have any sou left. - You've got luck in the love. It is of course not so bad if you still have got money. Maybe I should also try my luck. Put on the 6. It will come for sure. Well, do it! Exactly, everything on the 6. Actually, we are a good match, in every respect. - 5 rouge - So this is gone too. - Oh, loosing money in Nice is wonderful. - Your sense of humor is admirable. - Thank you. - Actually you are admirable quite a lot. Another one! How is it? - Looks great! - We are very photogenic. - He says it's great. - If he says so, it's certainly right. What? - There. - Thank you. I don't understand. Hey, Laura. Are you dreaming or what's going on? I think the casino has really earned enough from us. - I'm not a millionaire. - I very much regret. If you give me money once more, I'll pay it back tenfold. I swear to you by my love. Garcon? The lady wants to pay. Want to sleep on the carpet? - Say, can you think of something else? - Please, not now. Who was the bald fatty? Oh, I know many bald ones. You have to be more precise. You're not jealous, are you? Oh stop that. I am talking of the one at the airport. Please bring a whiskey. 27. No, no. A whole bottle! What am I supposed to do with a sample? Maybe you find bald heads incredibly sexy. Come on, tell me already! - I've never had anything with Charly. - Charly? - Did I say Charly? - You're suddenly very forgetful. But I don't know any Charly. You should think about it again. Maybe you can finally think of someone. Oh, my little brother's name is Charly. How fabulous. The little brother. Introduce him to me some time. Is that all? I've got more. But at the hotel. That is, if you didn't take it already. No, not this time, my sweetie. Where's your dear brother, by the way? - Never mind. - Yes, you're right. - Where are you going? - Make money. Do not worry. I have to start some time, don't I? Great, mesdames. Hey, mademoiselle, how about a photo? Get lost! Go away, or I'll make you get a move on, understand? - Now, I don't have any sou left. - You are copying me. - What should I do? - Come up with something. A whiskey to room 27. Say... Your fat friend from the airport... perhaps he gives you something. Be nice to him. Don't talk nonsense! - Just try it. - That's out of the question. I don't want to be photographed like that! Why is that? That's very sweet. "Laura in the bathtub. " Gonna be a series. Give me the film right away! No, no. I'll sell the photos. And I know to whom. - You must be crazy! - Don't get so loud. - There'll be more trouble for me! - Stop it, you're driving me mad. How can someone be so outrageous? You don't mind if I sit next to you, do you? Do you want something from me or from Laura? What could I want from you? I do not know you. I am extremely generous. If you want to talk to Laura, I'll go for a walk. So please, just go. Here, everybody can do as he likes. I have no desire to talk to you. How about you tell me something about your friend Berlinger. Get lost, you loafer! My friend, you are damn amusing. Well, as you wish. We will meet again. I should hope so. - Look, I've thought so. - I don't think you are able to think. Hello Roger, jump on, I cannot stop here! - You want too, granny? - Don't be so cheeky! As far as I remember, you wanted to call me in the Negresco? I could not sleep anymore. I think it's really brutal, to leave a man alone with his feelings. Say, what's the matter with you? You talk so like a waterfall. Well, yes we can catch up on everything. I'd think of something, but I can not tell you now. Oh, nobody tells me anything. - Oh, you're really sweet, Nadja. - Swindler! - Yes, really! - If I didn't exactly know why you say that, I would even believe it. - Ah yes? Works quite well. Maybe we get a free game. Shit, well, I was better previously. Doesn't matter. It's your turn. - Do you still have money? - Why? I need none. Look at that! You are really an exception. If you achieve more than 500 points, we'll stay together tonight. - I am very curious to see if I can do it. - It would be worth it. Well? Your husband is expecting you in the Engadin! Couldn't you think of a less favorable meeting point? Somewhere I had to talk to you. Then finally say what you want to talk about. - I warn you against the boy. - That really is my thing. He wanted to question me. He knows something about Berlinger. - Mrs. Parrish, I warn you. - How often do you want to repeat that? I would not overdo it. Your husband is very sensitive. - Say, where did you get it? - I stole it. - And the hotel, what did it cost? - A smile. Listen, Roger. About half a year ago, I lived with Parrish in the villa of a business friend. He's called Borell. I got along with him very well. I had the impression, he fell in love with me. I can't think of anybody else to help us in this situation. Why don't you ask your husband to send a check. Would be much easier. - I'd like to meet him once. - I believe you like, Roger. - What does he do? - Money. One more reason to be interested in him. He says with just some brain, you can be perfect in any industry. The guy has good sayings. Parrish knows what he's talking about. He is very clever. I believe that, unseen. I hurry. The villa of Borell was fantastic. But the residents all seemed to be whacky. True, they were lunatics. But unfortunately not harmless ones. Sure, it would still have been possible for me to leave then. But I was so damn curious, and always waited for the chance get involved. And where there is lots of money, there's also lots of money to get. - Laura! How charming. - You see, I keep what I promise. - I am really happy to see you. Hello monsieur. - How do you do?. I have never had time to come. But now I'm here. You're in luck. I only returned yesterday. - Yes, we're all too much on the way. - And the years pass. - I have something important to discuss with you. - Well, let's go outside. - A very pretty shirt. - Yes, I've painted it myself. Before the dance, we take a drink first. - Well, here's to you. - Nicely said. - Say, do you play with us. - Well, depends on what. Yes, definitely. We can think of a lot. - Laura, you're in trouble. - I hope you help me. Only on one condition: You are flying to Parrish as soon as possible. Not as easy as that. We don't know how much Roger knows. - What were you thinking? - I don't know. But I was just afraid of Parrish. You are a clever woman, and doing such stupid things. If you had at least contacted me. You know, I get along with him well. Well, now there is nothing to change. Somehow we'll get the thing out of the world. Parrish is so angry, as I have never experienced it. He will only give peace when you fly to him, and... You know, Jeff, it works with a steel helmet on the head: Put the hand grenade on there, release the pin, and it explodes. - Just don't move. - On the head? - On the head! My queen of the front soldiers! I will always wait for you, my angel, always. - Everything revolves around it. - Well, nothing better invented so far. I think you have to tell him somehow. Laura needs real man times, vroom. I would be exactly the right one. - You show-offs. - Listen to his words. Love makes the small one big. - Big enough. - Well, Roger? - Have you made friends with Jeff and Nicolas? - He is fast with that. - Yes, perhaps we should have brought Charly? - Who is Charly? Charly is Charly. The spells: C as in call-girl,... ...H as in hashish, A as in alcohol, R as robbery, and L as in lustmord. Y as in... uh... well,... any nice mess starting with Y. This composes Charly. - Yes, that is Charly. - Looks like you were sympathetic to each other. Yes, I like them. I hope they cherish the same feelings for me. In my house, there are only sympathetic people. - Now you, Roger! - No, I think I can't do that! - Oh, you'll make it. - Come here! No, I don't want to. Really. - Coward! - You can do it without me, can't you? This was in the Gulf of Pueblo Hindenburg in the Bahamas. The was in the time back then with Orson. A light breeze drove our catamaran from the lagoon to the open sea. We did not notice. Orson had just won the boat from me. I had a full house with three queens. He got a four of a kind with 8s. Now my sister in Paris was at stake. Suddenly Orson was gone. The suckers of the giant squid pulled the paint from the boat deck. My friends, the natives, call it the Nine-Tailed one. I yelled: Orson! I had a flush on the hand, and after all the boat belonged to him. The sea was like lead, upon which the single eye of the octopus swam. It's really a hot story you tell here. Sounds like a comic strip. But your friends are fascinated. It stared at me. Then a tremor went through the red-veined iris. Only those not knowing Orson can doubt it. - You, Laura? - I know the story by heart. I hear it every time. It was the gray cardinal, the hated loner among the killer rays,... ...as my friends had often described it to me. It glided over my boat. I was able to perceive the glint of his razor-sharp sword fins. The octopus was paralyzed. And so the gray cardinal slashed its eye. The South Sea turned into a volcano. Nonsense! Like Lava shocks, the wounded octopus thrust its mast-like tentacles... ...up into the azure sky of the South Sea,... ...but being blind, incapable to strike the cardinal! Suddenly I saw Orson. The Nine-Tailed one had caught him. He whirled high, slithered on the deck of the boat,... ...suddenly came to stop in front of me - and laughed! I am getting another drink. Do you want anything? What do you say? If you want something to drink. And if so, what? Haven't you had enough already? This is the only way to survive Borell's eternal grinning.. I find him very amusing. - How does he pay all this? - Some people do something now and then. I want to see that. What does he work, if I may ask? Anything. Jeff and Nicolas don't talk nicely about you. So what? - You have lovely shoulders, honey. - Thank you. Would be the smartest, if we sold your jewelry and saw that we got away. Can't you think of anything better tonight? I am totally serious We can not do anything else. - Parrish is the god of eternal cold. - Charly is his accountant. I don't know who is tougher. But I don't want trouble with either one. It was damn careless of Laura, ...to lie to Charly that Parrish had ordered to knock off Berlinger. If she had made me this nice offer... I would have done it all the same. Nonsense. Charly only loves his bank account. Dear friend, you may be mistaken there. Why do you think he did it otherwise? He does neither smoke, drink, nor gamble. He has got to have one passion. I' say it's Laura. Yes, of course, you are a bright one. - Roger! - Why were you not in the pergola yesterday? I didn't like it in Nice anymore. - But not because of me? - No! I like you. - I can not understand! - I like you! - What do you say? - I like you! - Say again! - I like you! I love youl! There they are. Yes, that's it but... But, there is no one there. The boat is empty. Jeff sees the boat. But he says there's no one there. - Continue to observe! - Continue to observe. I see something. Someone swimming. Looks like he jumped into the water. Jeff says that he has gone a bit into the water. Our friend won't bring us grief and drown? - Well, would not be bad for you. - What have you done with him? - Us? - Who else? What are you saying? But you're wrong you very much, Laura. We do not lay hands on such small fish. - My dear, I do not trust you. - And we do not know if we can trust you. I'm sorry, but I do not understand you. You have to have a goal. You certainly want something there. For example, you can't simply say: I am flying to Tahiti, just like that to Tahiti. You can say: I'm flying to Tahiti, ... maybe to dance hula-hula. I do not wanna dance hula-hula. I want to have some enjoyment, and go to Morocco for some time. Do you comprehend? What are your wishes? Wishes? You mean a trip? For all I care. - Yes, well. - Then I want to go to Las Vegas. - Las Vegas? That can be arranged. And who will pay for the crossing? But dear, money is no object at all. First there was no one. And now there are even two. - Let's meet tomorrow morning at the same place, yes? - Okay. - To Reno! - Las Vegas! Some table-football, Nicolas? - Yes, why not. Which side do you want to play? - Don't mind. - Well, then I take red. - OK. You'll lose anyway. Let's go out a bit. I cannot stand the brothers any longer. We must not do and not do as we like here. Excuse me, what do I care about these people. I can organize my time as I want. But not mine. Look at them. They suck. Get me rid of Roger. I want to be alone with her. But be nice to him, will you. We will take care of him. How long do you need? Two hours surely suffice for the lady. The boy will be comfortable with us. Do not worry. Go ahead. Go! - A real eagle. - No, it's an owl. Emperor of the skies, come with us. We are going to the casino. Ready to go? Please, place your bets. - On passe. - Passe. If the 19 won't come, then another number will. What the hell? - What? - No more bets. Your victory means nothing, dude. Nothing on that number. - Listen, how about you go to bed now? - What do you want from me? - Nothing, nothing at all. Just get lost. - What are you doing? - Leave the man alone, you bastards. - When Fortune smiles, Venus is no stranger. Feel free to play on. This was a little joke by them. So, we place this pile on 13, plein. I'm glad that we are finally alone. Which I've always dreamed of. The both of us, Laura, we'd be more than a match for all of them. - Are you afraid of Parrish? - If so, would I dare to do with you what I do? I'm afraid, you are expecting too much. - Oh, no! - Let go of mel! One hand washes the other. - You madman! - Are you crazy? - What is wrong with you? - I'm so sick of you! You're making a mistake, Laura. You need me, or have you forgotten yet? My nocturnal tour of inspection had success. There they were again: The pictures I had seen at Berlinger Laura, again Laura. But I did not get what the value of the photos was. Was Parrish jealous? Then he could have had them destroyed. And why had Berlinger had to die? Because she was his lover? Hardly. They would have tried to shoot me too. But then I discovered something more interesting than the photos. Something I could nail Parrish with. Berlinger has definitely had something with Laura. Otherwise he could never have taken the photos of her. Later, he blackmailed her with them. She would have had to knock him off, instead of sending Charly ahead. No, she claims it was an order of Parrish. She wanted to convince me that she had merely tasked Charly... ...to snatch these photos from Berlinger. - Photos are better than perjury. - A wise word. Is she fooling with us or not? If Parrish discovers that someone poked around here, he will rejoice. But we won't. He must never know! As if Parrish would ever have not learned something. Bugger-up! Caution. - We need security locks. - I'll take care of it. Laura! You look charming again. Did you sleep well? You look like runaway gorillas. There is something unpleasant: Roger searched through my desk tonight. - Oh yeah? - He discovered your photos. And the plans. Have you become completely nuts? How can you put my photos to the plans? This is insane. You put me in danger. Do you realize that? You want to hand me over to Parrish, am I right? Of course I am right. I knew from the beginning, that you cannot be trusted. Listen, Laura. There is only one way: You pack your things and immediately fly with my machine to Parrish to the Engadin. You will tell him the truth. This is still the best in this case. He loves you. And that's why you still have a small chance. And Roger? You must only think of yourself now. We want to help you, Laura, you know? Yeah, you're right. Maybe I should really return to Parrish. - Well then, who is taking me to the airport? - I'll tell my chauffeur to pick you up in one hour. Good. Very good, boss. Now I don't understand anything at all. Jeff, listen to good. You take my car, and bring the photos to Parrish. Clear? You bring along our friend Roger. On the way, completely incidentially, you let him alone with the photos. That way you see what he knows. - Yes, now I understand. A fabulous idea. - Hm, I do not know. I do not like the whole thing. The girl is as good as dead. Maybe you want to cry a little? You know what you have to do! - Good morning, madame. - Good morning. - You know? - Yes, madame. He just pretends as if he's still asleep. Hey, buddy, get up! Come on! I think we are insanely helpful, aren't we, Jeff? Look at this, Nicolas. Pretty, isn't it? It's a gift from me to the boss. The boss loves exclusively the expensive pieces of art. I can not bear to watch. I feel dear Roger wants to annoy us. Not nice of him. - Well, a mistake. - Come on, kid, move it! Yes, yes. Listen, pal. I run out of patience soon. - Come on. - Hey, you are nuts. Come on, get moving. You impotent pig, bastards, sons of bitches,... ...you lousy bums, you gay princes, damn pigs, you... Let go of me, damn it. - Wait, first tie your shoes. - He is messy too. Go, go. - So, kindly say goodbye. - Goodbye. I hope you enjoyed your stay with me. I wish you a pleasant journey. You see, now you'll be riding in a real car. Goodbye! Behave yourself decently, right? Well, what is this? - Here. - Hey, you're suddenly so polite. Scary, all the advertisement they do for that stuff. They want to sell it after all. As a photographer, you meet with many beautiful women. - It's not bad. - Why don't you take a photo of me? - The camera is in the car. - Yes, why not? - I would only have to load a new film. - Come on, get it. Okay, okay. Well done, keep moving! You're a killer, boy. Show it to me! Yeah, come on, boy. Bring it, c'mon, come! Yes, go boy. Great. Keep on going! Come, come, something new, come! - Do you have the advertisement on it too? - Yeah, why? Don't bother. Bit more to the left! Bit more to the left. Yes, good. Stay that way. Yeah, well, excellent. Keep going on. Yes, like that. If Lydia could see you like that! I want to spend my retirement years here. In a bungalow made entirely of glass. Well, just the way we millionaires construct. Say, what I wanted to ask you: are we traveling on expenses, or how does it work? $ 32 per day. Not bad at all! Well yes, the boss is very generous on this point. And that's just the expenses. - Insurance is extra. - Yes? That's a likeable trait of him. Yes, Mr. Parrish manages his empire very correctly. By the way: I've never seen a gorilla without a shooting iron. I got one - when I need it. Over there we could wonderfully ski. Listen, Roger: Better keep your hands off such women in the future. A friendly advice. In our business there is only trouble with women: They want to know too much. Yes, you're right. You sure have made your experiences, huh? And when you finally have them shot, they start screaming. Not this one. Bang, all dead I'm just pretending. I do not like the noise. Go to the room 113. - 113? - 113! He is coming up now, boss. - Yes, of course. He knows everything. - Yes, well. - That's what I thought. - What? You don't betray me unpunished. Get closer. Come, my friend. - To see you, no distance is too far for me. - And you? No words for him? You are Parrish. Am I right? - Here, drink! - Thank you. Maybe I find out now why I'm here. Are you not surprised, that I want to get to know the lover of my wife? My wife and I, we have no secrets amongst us. You may go. Everything ok, my friend? Do not forget to send me the photos. - Editorial Delloo. - Here Roger. Listen, I have *the* story for us. - What's up? - I photographed all the plans. - I don't understand what you're talking about. - I'm explaining it to you. - I'm tracking a big espionage affair. - So what? Now listen. What do you think of the headline: "Was Berlinger a spy? Did he have to die because of that?" You do not seriously think that the boss will spit out a single penny for that. If you don't believe me, Delloo, then get on a plane, come here and look at the material. - You know how mad the boss is at you. - Screw you, all of you!. You are finished. Will you give me another glass? Your last one. You cannot send me away. I know too much. Exactly. Your bad luck. What are you planning with me? You'll see. I lost the check you gave me this morning. You have to block it immediately. And you know what he said then? "Not necessary. " - Here is his address. - Thank you, Charly. - Yes, please? - Put me through to the Walther Palace Hotel, please. - Walther Palace, reception. - Please put me through to Mr. Parrish. - Parrish. - I demand $ 50,000. Or the thing will burst, Parrish. I've understood. You have won, young man. We have no more chance. - We? - Parrish is capable of anything. Did he send you here? Jeff and Charly waste no time. I don't know why are upset. Sit down on the bed. Do you think I am afraid of them? We're trapped. You know exactly. I think you're wrong. Parrish is trapped, not us. I've taken some interesting photos. Here, look at them. The will not save us either. What is it? A new tank design for an electric tank. Parrish will earn millions with them. Really? Then I demanded far too little. You do not have the slightest chance. Oh, yes. Certainly. I just had an interesting conversation with him. He was charming. - What are you going to do against Parrish? - What, me? You're just a dirty little crook! Well, maybe. But this time I dictate. And you cannot back off that easy. You're in it just like me. The is true. She didn't directly say "knock off". But she literally said "command from Parrish". And a command of Parrish still meant "knock off" every time so far. - Have you seen the photos? - You bet, Charly. Berlinger wanted to have a form of pressure against her. I wonder how he got her into it? In a weak moment, probably. Pretty stupid to have nude photos made of yourself. He wanted to blackmail Laura with them for sure. - As if Parrish bothers. - He knows her naked. Laura was terrified of a potential publication of the photos. Berlinger's death was the only way out for her. - I kept the negatives. This way you live longer. - You are a damn smart guy. Hello? Huh? Wishes to speak to me? Well then get him over here. Yes, I am listening. You and Laura take the 10:15 train to the Muottas Muragl. At the top you leave Laura alone. You yourself take the next train down. Then you wait in your hotel room until Laura comes back. We'll hand her the money at the top. And you give her the films to take with her. - What is the name of the mountain? - Muottas Muragl. What does he want up there? - I do not know. - Some information. Do you know what you're doing, Roger? You're walking into a trap. You make the mistake of underestimating Parrish. This is dangerous. One of us must do something about this. Forget Parrish's money. I have an account with a bank in London. - We can not go back. Too late. - I warned you. You do not have the negative. I mean, not the real one. It is in the hotel. - I love you, I love you, I love you. - Parrish has to pay again, really pay. - So, go now, my love. - Do not leave me alone. Delloo is the only one I've told the story from the beginning. But what should he say? Laura was right: I walked into a trap I made the mistake of underestimating Parrish Only Laura could have helped me... But she's dead. Nobody will believe me.
