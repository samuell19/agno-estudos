(gentle upbeat music) - Hey, Barry, I'm kind of busy right now. - [Barry] What's your greatest fear? - I don't have time for your jokes. I'm running late as it is. - [Barry] No, I'm serious. Your greatest fear. Think about it Nat, could be a lot of money in this for us. - For you, you mean. - [Barry] Listen, I just got off the phone with a new client. He needs four stories in splash pages by the end of today. I told him you're just the right girl for the job. - Hold on, who is this guy? - [Barry] Who cares? He already put up half of cash. Four stories and four drawings, Nat, all based on your greatest fears. You gotta deliver it all in person by five o'clock today. - That's not enough time. - [Barry] Do you want the gig or not? There's plenty of artists I could call. - Okay. Okay, I'm in. But on one condition, I want my name on the cover as creator. Full credit, not some pseudonym. - [Barry] That wasn't part of the deal. - It is if you want me. And you know I'll deliver. - All right, Nat, you got yourself a deal. Better get busy. And make it scary. (birds chirping) (gentle music) (birds chirping) (gentle music) (car engine revving) (gentle music) (car engine revving) - I can't guys, no, this isn't cool. We gotta go.

You're doing it. - Look, guys, I've heard horror stories about guys dicks falling off when they go to a whorehouse. This is crazy. - I'm not taking no for an answer on this. You already agreed to it. - Yeah, but I didn't think we'd actually do it. - Dude, what do you think this is, the average Joe's gems of fucking whorehouses? This is the Mercedes-Benz of brothels, all right. We're talking high quality stuff here. - We're talking the Hope Diamond of pussy. - And you two dorks know this how? - We asked around bro. Look, let's just look around in there. If it looks like a penicillin oral to hell, we'll just leave.

But I don't feel right about this, guys, I mean. - Jason, you have got to stop being so scared of pussy man. Listen, trust me on this. You do not wanna lose it to some girl at the bar, all right. The women here, they know exactly what they're doing and they get checked out regularly, probably. - These girls are incredible. They are clean, discreet and professional.

What do you think about trying some of this? Mmmm. Yeah. - You know, I'll always try anything. - And I heard the best place to put it is like right in the side of your boob, you know, so it gets in your bloodstream a little bit faster. So if that's something you wanna try. Hey, that's a freebie on me. - Same time next week. - Yes, have fun shooting that up. Let me know how it goes.

(gentle music) What is this? (gentle music) - Jezebel, whore. Why are you denying it? Just tell me the truth, Lucy. - Oh, sure. You're imagining things. You're just paranoid. I mean, what do you want me to say. - All right, so how do you explain theses? You know, I don't let you wear this kind of stuff. This is the attire of a whore, a Jezebel. - All right Marshall you've got the evidence now choke on it. - Choke on it, yourself. Do you have any idea what this is gonna do to my career, what it's gonna do to my personal life? What are the people at church gonna think of me now, Lucy? I'm gonna give you a joke and it's all your fault. - Marshall, our marriage has been deteriorating for a long time now. We've just, we've fallen away from each other emotionally, it happens. Let's just learn to deal with this like two adults. - Let's just deal with it, yeah, let's just deal with it. I will not have this in my house. You heathen bitch. Stop! I can't allow you to destroy me anymore. (Lucy crying) Bitch. (Lucy crying) Ruined my life. I hate you. You whore, Jezebel. (Lucy crying) (dramatic music) - Hey, it's me. Marshall knows, he found out. I guess we left some evidence in the backseat of the car. I know, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. But I mean, we knew he was gonna find out eventually. We weren't very careful anymore. We got too careless. And I'm just so scared. (gentle music) I'm so scared. He's just got that temper, I've talked to you about. [Lucy] What if he tries to kill me? I know, okay, okay. Okay, I'm sorry. Okay. You're right. (gentle music) [Lucy] You're right. Yeah. Yeah, I'm in, let's do this. - [Marshall Voiceover] Whore. - [Lucy] I just can't wait until it's over - [Lucy] Then we can be together forever, baby. [man speaks indistinctly] Okay. All right, bye. (gentle upbeat music) (panting) (gentle upbeat music) (birds chirping) (moaning) (dramatic music) - You've given me the kiss of Judas, Lucy. (dramatic music) "Wife, submit to your husband that says the Lord." Nothing to say, huh? Okay hot pants, go ahead and put these on for me. - What? No. - That's what I thought. You don't even wanna love me anymore, do you? It's like you said, this relationship really is over. It's hopeless, I don't know why I even bother. (dramatic music) (woman choking) You wanna make a fool outta me? You look stupid in everything. You're an idiot. You brought this all on yourself. You've got nobody else to blame but yourself. Die bitch. "So sayeth the Lord, wife submit to your husband." (dramatic music) (gasping) (dramatic music) Oh, sorry, honey. Bitch, you can't say you didn't deserve that one. (gentle music) (door bell ringing) (dramatic music) (door bell ringing) (door knocking) (door hinge creaking) Deacon Grantham. - Hey. I know it's a little later than normal. I got off of my shift a little late, so, but I brought those notes for your sermon next week on marriage in the Lord's eyes. - It just totally slipped my mind that you were coming tonight. I got so much going on tonight, I just totally forgot about it. It's fine, you can come on in. Come on in, make yourself home. Come let's go in here. (dramatic music) Have a seat right here. Have a seat right here. - All right. - So I got some really great ideas, you know, of marriage and divorce and all that stuff. Man, I'm a little parched. Mind if I go grab a beer? - No, wait a minute, come here, come here, wait, wait, whoa, whoa. It's just I'm so scatter brain, I just remembered I grabbed the last one. That's the last beer in there. There's no more beers, I drank the last one. Here, you can have it if you want it. - I wouldn't want to take your last beer. - It's perfectly fine. To be honest, I'm feeling a little queasy, I don't even even know why I grabbed it. I didn't even want it when I opened it. It's all yours. - All right, well, that's mighty cool of you. If you can't drink at for your Pastor, who can you drink at? - Too true, yeah. - All right bud, all right. - Okay. (gentle music) - Are you sure you're okay? (telephone ringing) It's your phone in there? You think Lucy will pick it up? Why don't you wait right there, I'll go get it, it could be important. (telephone ringing) (dramatic music) (bag rustling) Oh my God. (bag rustling) (dramatic music) - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. It's okay. You got me, you got me. You have to understand though, she was cheating on me. She would've ruined me. I didn't know what else to do. The Bible, Deacon you know this, the Bible looks down upon things like that. In the Old Testament's time, she would've been stoned to death. (gentle music) - Relax, put your hands down. - I lost it, I lost it, I didn't know what else to do. I'm sorry, but I'm not sorry, she deserved it. (gentle music) I'm sorry, I really am, but I didn't have any other, I had no other option. - Pastor, do you know how much I make a year? - How much? - Not a whole hell of a lot. After taxes and insurance and all that money my ex ran off with, well it doesn't really amount to anything. - I'm sorry to hear that, I truly am. - Does old Lucy have a life insurance policy? - You know, she does. Haven't thought about it until you brought it up just now, but yeah. - How much? - A million dollars. - Say you split that million with me. I help you dispose of the body and you don't get caught. We go our separate ways. - I don't understand, why would you do this? - Well, I got a lot of debts, you know, I'm sunk in my house, my husband ran off with all that money and I don't make shit. So I gotta do something. I'm not gonna get an amazing raise anytime soon. We got a deal? (gentle upbeat music) - Yes. You have a deal, my friend. - Excellent. (gentle upbeat music) - This is working out perfectly. I can't believe it. It's almost like it's. - God's will? - Exactly. It's a miracle, a true miracle. - Yeah, sure is. (gentle upbeat music) I thought we'd just bring her out here, set her on fire, let her burn until there's nothing left but ashes. Nobody ever be able to identify her that way. - I don't know, pretty dry out here this time of year. - [Grantham] You start a fire, the whole woods is going up? - [Pastor] Eh, I guess you got a point. Don't wanna do that. Last thing we need is Smokey the bear after our asses on top of everything else. Tell you what though, my parents stay, they've got land down here. There's an old well, it goes down for miles. What do you say we take old Lucy for swim down there. By the time everybody finds her, there won't be anything left. Nobody will ever know it's even her. Just bones and little bit of dust maybe. (gentle upbeat music) - As long as you get the insurance pay out on it. That's all I really give a shit about. (dramatic music) - Dead weight. Why don't you make yourself useful, give me a hand. Oh God. Lucy, maybe we should have done the Jane Fonda aerobics, like you wanted. All right. God. Oh god. (dramatic music) Jesus, maybe this wasn't such a good idea after all. - Can you make it? - Sure. - Christ, couldn't you get somebody who knows what they're doing? - Hey, I know what I'm doing. - You sure about that? - Oh Jesus Christ. - Why don't you take this? Why don't I grab the body? - Yeah, why don't we do that, She-ra? Go on and pick her up there, China. Show me how it's done. Woman power and all that crap. (dramatic music) What matter, She Hulk, getting too heavy for you? (dramatic music) Well, here we are. I think we're far enough out here. I think this is good. We're far enough out here. - Are you sure? - [Pastor] Yeah I used to come out here hiking when I was a kid, all the time. Nobody ever comes out here this far. - I don't know about that. I guess I'll take a look around the perimeter, make sure we're alone. - Yeah, why don't you go do that. (dramatic music) Let's get you a path here sweetie. So you can go take a pill. (dramatic music) Come on. (dramatic music) - What the hell? - Fucker. (Marshall screaming) (dramatic music) - Oh, you're back. Ooh, ooh, careful. Oh, don't take it too fast. Here. (dramatic music) - I love you. - I love you too. - What am I gonna do, should I just leave? - No, absolutely not. It'll be just fine. We're gonna beat him at his own game and we'll be set for life. Okay. All right, I'm in. You always make me feel better. - Shew. - Did it work? - It worked. He went down. Just easy as pie. Come on. Come on, all right. Ooh, steady on your feet. Oh, you okay? - My head hurts. My throat's really sore. - No kidding. Fucker, strangled the fuck outta you, didn't he? - Yeah, he did. Is he gone? - He's gone, down the well. - Uh. - Thank you. And you can collect the life insurance. But I think our plan worked. The drug I gave you, that you put in your tea, knocked you out pretty good. I was kind of freaked out when I saw you all wrapped in plastic, but it's all over. - Thank God. - It's okay. - All right, let's try to get the fuck outta here. (dramatic music) - [Grantham] Come on. (gentle upbeat music) (birds chirping) (gentle upbeat music) (all laughing) (Daddy laughing) (dramatic music) (Marshall screaming) - Oh fuck, oh geez. Oh God, oh fuck. - Oh God. - Oh my God. - Oh fuck, oh shit, oh God. Ow. - Oh my God. Oh my God. - Oh God. Let go, I'm sorry. - Oh God, okay. - I'm sorry. - Oh God. - I'm sorry. - Okay, okay. (Lucy crying) - Okay, it's okay. Oh just, you gotta keep it together, you gotta keep it together please. Please. Okay. - Okay. - What you're gonna do is you're gonna have to go back to the car and you have to get a tire iron or fucking something, anything, I don't give a shit. - [Lucy] Okay. - And go and get it so I can get this trap off my leg. - Okay. - Please. - I'll be right back. - Oh fuck it hurts. - Don't go anywhere. - Oh God fuck. Oh God, oh God I'm gonna die. (dramatic music) Okay. Okay. What the fuck was that? (dramatic music) Lucy, was that you? (rocks knocking) (dramatic music) (rocks knocking) (dramatic music) (rocks knocking) Oh shit. Oh fuck. (dramatic music) (rocks knocking) Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Our fuck. Our fuck. (dramatic music) (gasping) (birds chirping) - "And Jesus roared, Lazarus come out." (dramatic music) (Grantham moaning) (dramatic music) (woman crying) You're not going anywhere. And the devil was an angel. (panting) Bitch! (all laughing) (snake hissing) (fire raging) - [Reporter] A flaming wildfire that shut down a stretch of a major Interstate near the Appalachian mountain border exploded in size as crews on Sunday, scrambled to prevent flames from reaching rural communities. The blaze and Red River National Forest was burning out of control after chewing through 69 square miles of timber and brush since Thursday. Firefighters working in a rugged terrain were contending with hot temperatures and gusty winds. Authorities announced Friday that a 44 mile section of Interstate 64, North of Cravenburg would remain closed until further notice. In one section, the remains of three charred bodies have been discovered in what is currently being investigated as a possible murder/suicide situation. No one is sure what started the fires, but a full investigation is underway. This is an ongoing story y'all so stay tuned for further details as we get them. (fire raging) (gentle upbeat music) (cellphone ringing) - What's the matter, last one wasn't scary enough for you? - [Voice Of Fear] It was good, but it's not what I want. - Who is this? - [Voice Of Fear] You have two more stories, two more chances. - Did Barry put you up to this? - [Voice Of Fears] I don't want just anyone's fears, Natalie, I want your fears, your greatest fear. - How did you know my name? (wind gushing) (gentle music) (pipe banging) (gentle upbeat music) - Can you cut that out man, it is really annoying. (dramatic music) Oh motherfucker. Hey, get back here. (dramatic music) - [Chud Voiceover] I have no home, but I still hope. Some nights I get to sleep, but sadly, it's only to wake up and be back in this living fucking hell. This is not me, it's what I've become. The sidewalks are cold, but not as cold as the people that just walk by, not looking or caring. To them, we could all probably just be dead. They are the judge and jury. The streets, our executioner. (dramatic music) I'm scared, can you believe it? Please believe it. I don't. But I need someone to. I know I'll die out here. I'm not worried about that part. I'm more worried about what'll happen to my body after my soul has left it. But not scared. The streets can be cruel, the streets can be tough. But for better or worse, the streets are always watching. - I have to save you. - Oh shit there he is. - Good old KKK. - KKK? - Yeah, Kray Kray Karl, the guy's a fucking nut. - Guy's fucking dangerous. You're gonna wanna stay clear of him. - Get real Spliff. He's harmless. I've been around him constantly. - Harmless my ass. I've heard so much about this guy. - [Homeless] Like what? - Shit man, where do I begin? There's so many theories on what made KKK, KKK. He to be one of the biggest drug dealers in the city. He controlled everything around here. And then one day a rival drug dealer put like a lethal dose of LSD in his drink. He drank that in wet nuts, ended up killing half the people at some party. (dramatic music) The ones who survived were so scared that they never testify. So the police like can't even pin anything on him. And that's how he got the name KKK. Krazy Killer Karl. - That's bullshit. That's not what I heard at all. I heard one day he got the bright idea he was gonna rob a dice game. He almost got away with it, but they caught up with him at his mom's house, raped and killed her right in front of him in retaliation. And it was so much that he just snapped. So now he wanders the streets trying to write the wrongs of that night. And that's why he is always fighting the air and shit, he's trying to fight them demons. (dramatic music) Yo, that's deep. - Fighting the demons yo. - That's fucking stupid, that's what that is. He's just some poor schmuck like us, stuck on the streets, trying to make a way from himself. - No, that motherfucker is a killer. You know, he is the one who killed Niles, right? - Shut the fuck up. - What? You know, he was the last one to be seen with him. I heard he killed a bunch of us. Just nobody cares because it's people like us. If you ask me, he's working for the police to get rid of us. - Where are you getting this shit from, man? - Where am I getting it from? Three of us dead in two weeks, that doesn't worry you? Everyone thinks that fool's harmless, but I'm just saying, watch your fucking back out here. - He ain't no cop, I heard he killed a pig. - My fucking hero. (all laughing) - [Chud Voiceover] They don't trust us. We don't trust us. We wanna believe we're better. Better than the ones that judge. We're not. (dramatic music) - Yo, he's coming this way. - I have to save you. - Save this you fucking dickhead. - [Chud Voiceover] It can never get worse. I repeat that constantly. But constantly, constantly I'm reminded that it can. (upbeat music) - Everything copacetic? - Totally. I'm homeless, drunk and horny. What more could I ask for? - I could help you with one of those things, you know. - Really, you could get me a home? - You have a home. - Just like Niles did. - What, you're letting that KKK story get to you? - What if it's true? What if one way or another the stories are true? What if KKK is killing us? (upbeat music) - Well, I have to salute you because you, my friend, are officially flagged. (both laughing) - Thank you. - Don't thank me. I'll be right back. (upbeat music) (singing indistinctly) (upbeat music) (police sirens blaring) - God, I had a fucking piss. (dog barking) (police sirens blaring) (dramatic music) Oh, Karl, what's up? (dramatic music) - I must save you. - No saving needed, my friend. We're all drinking over on Fifth, if you wanna come by. I got a handle of a. - I must save you. - Karl, what the fuck are you talking about? - I must save you. - Fuck are you doing, man? Get the fuck away from me. (dramatic music) I deserve this. - No, you don't. I have to save you. - There is no saving me. - [Chud Voiceover] This is it. I've been waiting, waiting longer than most. Shorter than the ones who never had to be here. I always knew it would come, always knew it wouldn't be how I wanted, but I didn't think it'd be like this. Strangely, my thoughts turned to him. What brought him to this place? What brought his punishment to me? - I have to save you. - [Chud Voiceover] No, this is not how it ends, not from me. - [Karl] I have to save you. (dramatic music) - [Operator] 911, what's your emergency? - Hello, help please. He's chasing me, I think he's gonna kill me. - [Operator] Where are you calling from? - I don't know.

We got dibs. - I'm actually, I'm kind of tired from the drive. - You're tired? - Yeah. - You slept the entire way up. Come on, you see outside, it's beautiful. Let's go for a walk. - I'd like that. (Laura laughing) - Laura hold on. Move into the light. - Taylor God. - Can't help it, the camera loves you. - But do you love me? - Shh, don't ruin the shot. (camera shutter clicking) (birds chirping) (camera shutter clicking) Nice. (birds chirping) (camera shutter clicking) (birds chirping) - Do you hear that sound? I heard it when we first got here. - It's probably someone doing yard work or something. So much for the peace and quiet out here. (birds chirping) (camera shutter clicking) - I've never heard anything like it before. - Shh, don't be weird. Stay still. (birds chirping) (dramatic music) (camera shutter clicking) Nice. Yeah, hold that pose. I'm really liking this. (dramatic music) I'm gonna make you a famous model. (dramatic music) (birds chirping) Laura. What? - I saw something there. - I don't see anything. - It was there, I saw it. - You saw someone in the woods. - No, it wasn't a person it was, it's hard to explain. It was like, I don't know. - It wasn't Bigfoot, was it? - Taylor, no I'm serious please. - Come on. You know what I think, I think all this fresh mountain air is just driving us a little crazy. - Yeah, maybe. (birds chirping) - Now let's pick out our master bedroom. Yeah? - Hold on. Wait, there's someone here I think. Look at this. - Oh, isn't this a nice surprise? - Hi. - I was beginning to think I had the place all to myself. I could use some help. Thanks. So when did you two get here? - A few hours ago? - Yeah. - Beat the traffic. I'm Taylor, by the way, I'm the DP. - Oh, Alexis, key makeup and hair. Are you with the camera department too? - Oh no, I'm just here with Taylor, I'm Laura. - You'll probably wanna go back to L.A. after a few days. Movie sets aren't nearly as exciting or glamorous as people think. - It's okay, I'm just gonna work on my dissertation. - Oh, you're still in school? How'd you guys meet? - We're throwing a party or? - Oh, you know these mountain towns, they have one bar up here and last calls at 10. I like to wine at the end of the day, don't you, Taylor? - Speaking of, should we go get cleaned up before everyone else gets here? - Yeah, sure. - Save some hot water for me. - So my roommate had an extra ticket and she dragged me to the concert. And then Taylor was on stage shooting and I was in the front row. - You kept getting in my shot. - Yeah. And then you hunted me down afterward. And that's the story. - Say when. - No, I'm good. - Okay. - [Taylor] Thanks for making dinner. - Yeah. - [Taylor] What'd you say was in the sauce? - Well, some old family recipe. I usually make it spicier, but I figure it was hot enough already. - I didn't notice. - Are you kidding? It had to be like 85 when I got here. It's like, isn't it supposed to get colder, the higher you go? It's like November. - You were probably standing too close to the stove. - Or maybe it was hot flashes. I'm just kidding. - It's getting pretty late. I wonder when the others are gonna show up. - Maybe they found about a gig. - Mike was on the five the last time I spoke to him. - Or maybe he's drunk off his at a bar like that gaffer on that one show, you remember? His girlfriend was like freaking out and she's all like, "Where's Keith?" And we're all like, well why are you asking us? We thought he was at home with you. - Wait, did do you guys, you worked together before. - Did we? That's right. I knew you looked familiar. God, that must have been years ago, I can't believe I forgot. - Anyway, why don't we carpool tomorrow? Be like just me and my kit. Unless you're planning on coming. - Oh no, I have work to do. In fact, I think I'm gonna turn in a little bit early. - Are you sure? - Yeah. (insects chirping) (birds chirping) (dramatic music) (birds chirping) (keboard keys clacking) (birds chirping) - Fuck. Fucking first timers. I knew I should not have taken this gig. - What happened? - Nothing. - Alexis and I were the only ones that showed up at the location. - That's so weird, I wonder what happened. Where'd they go? - How the fuck should I know? We were texting, leaving voicemails, trying to get a hold of somebody. Nothing, radio silence. It's like someone pulled the goddamn plug on the shoot and did not have the balls to tell us. - Sorry Taylor. - Did you hear anything? - No. Honey it's sweltering in here. - Hey Mike, missed you today. Where the fuck are you? Why did you not come? Fuck. God dammit. - Well, this thing's useless. Are you getting a signal? - My phone's upstairs. - Could you give it a try? - Yeah, sure. (dramatic music) - Is the AC working? 'Cause it doesn't seem like it. (dramatic music) - Will you calm down. (dramatic music) - Jesus. (dramatic music) - Any luck? - Nope, nothing. Sorry. - This is bullshit. I don't know about you two, but I'm ready to bail. - There's no way I'm driving three hours back to L.A. tonight. I'm fucking exhausted. - Same, I didn't get any sleep. I mean it didn't even get dark until after midnight. - Okay, I think that we should all get some rest. I'll drive into town and try to get a landline or a signal or something. - Really okay? Be careful. - I'll be right back. (dramatic music) - No wifi, no cell service. Not even a frigging TV. Really are in the boonies. I've done makeup on over 30 shows and I've seen some shit, but nothing like this. Hey, you want a makeover? We've got the time. - No, thank you. (keboard keys clacking) - What are you writing anyway? - My dissertation. - Right. Taylor told me you're a science major. - Environmental science. - Oh. Gonna save the world, huh? Well good luck with that. - What else did Taylor tell you about me? 'Cause he didn't mention you. - Let me give you some free advice, sweetie. Don't get too attached. He's not the nesting type. We were together for about a year before he moved on and well, sooner or later he'll get bored with you too. (birds chirping) - Fuck. (birds chirping) (dramatic music) (screaming) - [Taylor] I can't believe you're bringing that up right now. - [Alexis] You could have at least called. - It was a year ago, okay. - It was a year. - Just get over it. Move on. Oh my God. Are you okay? How are you feeling? Easy, easy. You passed out. We found you in the woods. You must have fainted. I don't know. - I went for a walk then I saw it. Taylor, I saw it. - It's okay, you're okay. - It was just like before. I heard the sound, that sound and then I saw it. The same thing I saw yesterday. It was like a circle of light. And only now I could see it more and then I could feel it too. I could feel the heat coming from it. - Yeah, you must have hallucinated and passed out. It's gotta be 90 degrees outside. - No. - Thank God I got back when I did it. - It was not a hallucination. - Maybe they don't have cell towers around here. But what I don't get is why the convenience store was closed. I mean, it's Tuesday afternoon, they should be open. Alexis is right though, it's fucking hot in here. - So let's take a few things off. - Well that wasn't exactly what I meant, but. It's so fucked up. It's after 9:00 p.m. and it's still bright as day. - What's wrong? - Nothing. Are you feeling okay? - Yeah. I know it sounds weird, but I feel better now than I did this morning. - Well I'm happy for you, but I'm exhausted. Goodnight. (dramatic music) Are you sure you wanna do this? - There's no phone, no internet, we're running out of food. And we're not just cut off from the movie Taylor, we're cut off from the world. - I understand, but I don't think it's safe to drive right now okay. Where's your car anyway? - It's just up the road. And I can't sleep here. How can anybody with all this light? Every day it gets hotter and brighter. And if I stay here one more hour, I'm gonna melt. - You're being dramatic. - Have you looked at yourself, man? How much sleep did you get last night? This is fucked up and you know it. Are you sure you don't wanna come with me? (dramatic music) - I tried to convince her to stay but that's how she is, stubborn. Maybe she's right. What's this? - [Laura] Breakfast. That's all we have. - You're not having anything? - I'm not hungry. It's better now. - What's better? - Now that she's gone? - I'm sorry I didn't mention it earlier. Alexis and I, it was a long time ago. - I know. - If you want to talk about it. - Not really. (keboard keys clacking) (birds chirping) (keboard keys clacking) (dramatic music) - Laura, Laura. Laura. Laura, please. Please help me. Please Laura. Please help me. (Alexis crying) (dramatic music) (Alexis crying) Oh, I can't go home. It was so bright, I couldn't even see the road anymore. And I wanted to stop but I couldn't. I had to keep going. I felt like if I could just stay on the road, I could get away. Is there any wine left? - Yeah. - So I kept driving until, as far as I could and the road ended so I had to. - What do you mean ended? - It ended Taylor, there was nothing. It was the end of everything. Oh, thank you. - There is no end, only beginnings. (dramatic music) - And the heat, the heat was unbearable. I felt like I was burning alive and I was just sitting there. And then I don't know how but the car flamed up, it just, it was literally in flames. And then I had to get out of there, I had to get away. And there was ash, there was ash in the sky, it was coming down like rain. And that light that burned your eyes, it was everywhere. And I couldn't see where I was going. There's nowhere to go but back here. Taylor, what is happening, what are we gonna do? (Alexis crying) (dramatic music) (crying) - Fuck is wrong with this thing? What are you looking at? (dramatic music) ♪ How do you know if you're dead ♪ (gentle music) ♪ There's only one way to find out ♪ (gentle upbeat music) ♪ Ooh, ooh, oh ♪ ♪ Ooh, ooh, oh ♪ (gentle upbeat music) ♪ Ooh, ooh, oh ♪ ♪ Ooh, ooh, oh ♪ (gentle upbeat music) ♪ Ooh, ooh, oh ♪ ♪ Ooh, ooh, oh ♪ (gentle upbeat music) ♪ Ooh, ooh, oh ♪ ♪ Ooh, ooh, oh ♪ (gentle upbeat music) ♪ I have been in the dark ♪ (gentle upbeat music) - Laura. Alexis. I didn't know you were awake. - Couldn't sleep. - Me neither. - It feels like I haven't slept in days. I don't even know what day it is anymore. Have you seen Alexis? I've been thinking about this situation and I think we've been making a big mistake. We keep going down the mountain to look for help, but we should be going up. - Up? - Yeah, I mean we can't stay here, Laura. The fire or whatever it is, it's getting closer every day. Can't you feel it? It's an oven out here. But if we get to higher ground, it'll be cooler at the top, it has to be. It's our only chance. I'm gonna start packing. - Alexis, we have to go. (door knocking) Open up. (door knocking) I've got a plan. (door knocking) Alex. (dramatic music) No. No. (crying) No. (dramatic music) - She's dead, she killed herself, Laura. We have to go now before it's too late. - If that's what you want. - What the hell is that supposed to mean? We can't stay here. - Why not? - What's wrong with you? - Nothing's wrong with me. - You're crazy. This place is driving us all crazy. - I need to stay, this is good for me. - How could this be good for you? How could this be good for anyone? Do you wanna die too? - Please understand, Taylor, please. - No, we're leaving. (dramatic music) Time to go now. - Right. It is time. - Please Laura, stop with the games, we have to leave. - You should go. They don't want you anyway. - What the fuck are you talking about. (dramatic music) Laura. (dramatic music) Come on, we have to go. (dramatic music) (crying) (seatbelt alarm beeping) (dramatic music) (gravel crunching) (dramatic music) (car engine revving) (crying) (dramatic music) (car engine revving) (screaming) (dramatic music) - [Voice Of Fear] Natalie. - Stop it. - [Voice Of Fear] Not until you give me what I asked for. - I gave you the stories, what more do you want? - [Voice Of Fear] You know what I want? I asked you to show me your greatest fear. - I'm not listening to you. (moaning) - [Voice Of Fear] Show me your fear. Your greatest fear. (dramatic music) Your greatest fear, Natalie. (dramatic music) - [Voice Of Fear] It's you. (dramatic music) (crying) (dramatic music) (crying) (dramatic music) (screaming) - [Reporter] Authorities are still searching for illustrator and writer, Natalie Chase, creator of bestselling comic book, "Hi-Fear." Reports have surfaced of Chase suffering from hypochondria and undergoing anti-aging treatments. But according to her publisher, Barry Novak, Chase is in perfect health at the time of her disappearance. "Hi-Fear" continues to rack up record sales for Nightfall Comics, who recently announced the movie deal is now in the works. We can only imagine how scary that's going to be. (dramatic music) - [Voice Of Fear] What's your greatest fear. (Voice Of Fear laughing) (dramatic music) (gentle organ music) - Just like my mother used to play an organ. Jesus spoke to me and told me that I had to raise a quarter of a million dollars or else my life was gonna end. To demonstrate, we have a timer here, with this dynamite. If you don't start calling in and making your donations, who knows it could blow up and that could be the end of Cove Ministries. And we all don't want that, nobody wants that. I don't believe so. Well, again, just give what you can. The big message here is that you have to help me. Jesus wants to call me home. I want to go home, but I'm not ready quite yet. Your donations, they can make a difference here. Give what you can. Kids at home, if you got a piggy bank laying around there, go ahead and grab that crack that thing open. You don't need those old devil worship and music tapes. You don't need the video games with all the violence and all that horrible stuff. Send your money to me, keep me alive.
