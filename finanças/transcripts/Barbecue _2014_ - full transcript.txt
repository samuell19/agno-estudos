For Arnaud Delaireja, my best friend. I'm sure you won't believe, that I am 50 years old. Actually it's true. My birthday is next week. I have a flat belly right? You wan't to know my secret? I am always hungry and I walk three times a week. The problem is I ... started to think a lot about my life, and it scares me. I have everything a man wants: a wife, a son, a job, friends. But somehow ... -Honey, I'll be right ahead! -Antoine, get out of the way! Don't wait for me! Idiots. What I experienced in the next 5 seconds was probably the best thing that ever happened to me. 10 days earlier... Barbecue is like a ballet. Because in ballet, everyones role is precisely defined. Womens role... -Honey, can't you help me with the chairs! -No I can't, I'm responsible with the fire! ... and mens role. I think you should put this here. I know. I was just about to. Thank god I bought a Weber. This is the Rolls Royce of grills. I said thank god I bought a Weber It is the Rolls Royce of grills, isn't it? Yes. You see Antoine agrees with me. Daddy, pass me the ball! Watch out! You're out, Jean-Mi! What do you mean I'm out! Laurent please take my place. I'm exhausted. Come on, give me a break! Thank you. How's Laurent? -What's he working on? -You know he bought some land in Mulatiere In the middle of nowhere and cheap But with the new tram coming in And the price went sky high. Excellent news! Yes, yes really good news. -But you're cheating! -No there are rules. -Hi, Mom! -Hey honey, how are you. -You can have some. -Mom look, daddy's here. -Yes. -How are you, Olive? -Good and you? -Can you take these. -Yes, thank you. How about you no hello to Mom! -Hey, Jean-Mich. -Hi, Olivia. Hi. Are you okay? You have to pick up Camille on Wednesday, I hope you didn't forget Mom, come play! Is this ball FIFA approved? Catch me if you can... In your dreams! Mama that was a foul! No, come on it was fair. Ladies and gentlemen, finally the beef! Hello everyone! Sorry I'm late. Barely an hour. Where were you, was there traffic? No the roads were fine, I had a difficult surgery. Due to my patients large intestinal infections. -We had to do a Vasectomy. -We don't need to hear the details. Sorry my work doesn't interest him. It's not that, we're eating. Then, I'll have a really rare piece. There you go. Here. Jean-Michel, can you pass the beans. I hate this. I don't like vegetables. They seem to like you. Thank you, Olivia. How come you eat so much and don't get fat? -Do you throw up? -No. I empty it. There is no better diet. You can loose 4 kilos a month. -Excellent meat! -It's really good! My secret is in the coal! Yes, Yves is the best. He puts the meat on grill and then... turns them over! Me on the other hand, went and did the shopping, vacuumed and cleaned up the house, went to the hairdresser and got a new hair color which nobody noticed by the way. Why did you bring this salt? -We're having a barbecue honey. -Then let's just eat on the floor. Laura, can you bring the mustard too! She's exaggerating isn't she? When she lived with her mother, I had to do my own shopping and wash my own laundry. Unbelievable! You men, you just need one occasion. Just because you washed your clothes once My thoughts suddenly were taking form Everything was getting clearer I was getting bored Everything was boring me First of all we need to look at the pharmacies Therefore I suggest we take two sample areas. No no that's just bullshit! First we need to look at dermatologists and then practitioners then the pharmacies. When things go wrong, people find comfort at home My problem is that they're both the same to me. Antoine? Can you give me a ride? My car is not here. I could, but... I live on the other side of the city. Can you ask Sophie or Nicholas? They live closer to you. Your brother has things to do! So does your sister. Are you OK, you look weird. No no, I'm really fine. You see it went well with Baptiste The less I see him, the better. He will never change anyway Did you know he wasn't working on Wednesdays for two years? Yes. Oh, really! Everybody knows. He has a day off and I don't know about it! And on Wednesday I went to pick up his mother. His mother! Not mine, his I say! God knows what his majesty is doing. Maybe playing golf. He always did as he pleased. Tell me then... are you seeing anyone? No not really. I mean... I just had a small fling, but nothing special. What does that mean? Wait a minute. Are you trying to give me lessons? You want to talk about drawing? A girl who notices that someone is drawing, can't resist but look She will want to see what she looks like that's why I draw girls. -Is that me? -A gift Aren't you going to sign it? That's my stage name. -Bedankt. -Bedankt to you too Why do I listen to this story? all the time... Can you check on Vero What has this got to do with her! Imagine if she did the same to you Impossible. She doesn't know how to draw. Aren't you afraid the girls would want more from you? No, that's not a problem. Hello Geraldine! I was just about to call you. When can I see you? I don't know... If you want Tonight may be I just have to go to the pharmacy No no it's not a big deal. It's a genital thing you know. You understand? Itching, redness and so on.... Yes, it hurts. I'm not an expert, but I think it is not contagious. -And no more calls. -You bastard. I don't hurt them, I just disgust them. You're disgusting! Go, go go. Bye! Fasten your seat belt. I'll see you on Wednesday. Daddy, your bears hurt me! I'll pick you up from the horses. Not a horse, a pony! A pony is a small horse. Have fun with your mom! Okay! The day when Olivia left him, Baptiste said that she would come back It was a good guess but... Olivia did not come back. Did you talk about much with Olivia? What did you talk about? Baptiste took shelter in my house I lived near by My wife was almost never home -Hi! -Hi It was a good solution. And Baptiste was the best cook among us Our number tags for the race have arrived Super I think I found an apartment Ok. You don't need to rush. You can stay another hour or two. What did you prepare? Boiled water. Actually I like to cook for the children. If we add a little salt I think it will be a real feast. In the basement I had a Chateau Yquem 1976 Outstanding sauternes. I've had it for a special occasion to put someone in a good mood who cries over boiled water. -So? -It's sweet. Of course it's sweet It's sauternes. You don't like it? You think Olivia is seeing anyone? I know that you know actually. She tells you everything. -Does she? -Your'e a bastard. I don't know. And she doesn't tell me everything. So stop it. I have never cheated on Olivia you know right? Never. Except with little Xerox from the print shop. Well, except little Xerox from the print shop. And the neighboor in Fourviereju. And the black chick in Val d'sere You did it on the chairlift if I'm not mistaken No it was the cabin next to the cable ways. But that's not cheating. It didn't mean anything. And it's history it doesn't count What, you wear glasses now? No, I just love them. Wearing glasses. Gosh, I forgot. I have a dinner tonight. And Vero is on duty. -Do you want me to stay? -No, go live your life. Live your life! I would rather live alone. I'm relieved. Middle aged men are usually criticised for pursuing younger women My case is quite different I have always liked 25-year-olds. -Good evening. -Good Evening. I don't want to grow old. I don't want to look old. I'm watching what I eat, but I don't think there's a diet for short sightedness. -What a smashing menu! -I mean, everything looks great -Yes, really. Have we decided? What would you recommend for me? The entire menu. Everything is delicious. -You need a bit more time. -Yes please. I'll be back shortly -Oh it's vibrating. -Vibrating? Yes, my phone. It's from work. Can you excuse me for two minutes. PASTA AND RISOTTO OK. I'll call you! And a glass of champagne, please. Of course madam. And for you? I'll have the "Linguine alle Vongole." I'm afraid that we don't have that on the menu. You'll have to go to the Italian restaurant next door for that. Then I'll have whatever shes having. Double veal liver. Medium pink. Thank you. Liver gives strength doesn't it? Vero? Are you home? Yes, my shift got cancelled. What did you do? I was going to say I had dinner with Baptiste as usual But Baptiste lived with us. So, I decided to say that I was with Olivia On the way back I went to Olivia. I called you but couldn't reach you. Where were you? One moment I'm coming. I had to be quick Yves was in a business seminar Who knew where Laurent was. So I only had Jean-Mich. I went to see Jean-Michel I visited his workshop. He was doing his 15.000 maintenance. So we stayed late and ate something. And you? I'm exhausted. Want to go to bed. I'm exhausted too. Hi. Antoine! Your car is ready. I've put in 5-30 motor oil. Top notch. -Is that okay? -Super. Listen, Jean-Mich Yesterday we had dinner together alright? Just in case. I had a thing with a young chick. A beautiful Dutch girl. A real babe What do you mean by a "thing"? You know, a plan. Do you want me to demonstrate? I got some. Are you cheating on Vero? Who cares? Whats that got to do with anything! If someone asks, we had dinner together, understand! Nothing else. Does Vero know? Of course she doesn't know I wouldn't be asking for a favor! This is a great mystery. Yes but... Not such a big deal Come on. This is too much for me. I can't keep it a secret. What do you mean you can't? I just told you, so you have to! I can't. I know my self. Listen my friend I can't promise that I will and then I tell everyone and you find out. No, now I'm telling you. I can't keep this secret. Come on Jean-Mich! I bet you can. I don't have anything interesting to say. But you and a Dutch girl will interest everyone! What are you talking about Jean-Mich? What are you saying.. Oh my god...? See you on Sunday at the race. If you tell anyone, I'll kill you. Welcome to the annual Rhone Run sponsored by Caisse d'Epargne Vero, you want some Gatorade? -No, thank you. -Would you anything else? No, I'm fine. Thank you. Tell me if you need anything. Yes, sure! This year I'm going to outrun you! -You see I didn't say anything -Good for you So how is it going to work with the Dutch girl? Is she going to move here or are you going away? What Dutch girl, what are you talking about? What does she do for a living? I don't know what she does. I just saw her once! Move, move! Get out of my way! I'm good, I'm good. I got my rhythm. It's been just 2 minutes. There are 10 more laps to go. Yes, but I feel good. I'm in the zone Antoine is running too fast. He's going to fail. -Don't rush honey, I'll stay with you. -If you can catch me. Look at Olivia she bought new sneakers. Please don't tell me she has a boyfriend. Does she or doesn't she? I can not talk. That's a big mistake, severe mistake! Honey I'll be right ahead! Antoine, get out of the way! Don't wait for me! Idiots. Yes! 1:10:48! My new record! Did Antoine finish? No, I did not see him. I killed him! I am ahead, I am ahead! Baptiste, what did you do? I don't know and I don't care Probably it is around 1:12. Bravo. I have 1:10 can you believe it I made it before Antoine! He will never recover from this! Bravo, I am proud of you honey! Where is Antoine? Unbelievable. Probably he's going to make it in two hours. See! Even Jean-Mich beat him. Horrible. You all right, Jean-Michel? I can not talk. You know, I ran 1:10. I beat Antoine. -A bit more. -I'm going home to take a shower. We'll go to church with Laura and meet you guys at lunch Perhaps he was ahead of us and finished first and left. No way! Very strange. Sorry, sorry move out of the way please! Hospital You learn a lot when you have a heart attack I had no idea about therapeutic hypothermia. Basically, they cool your body, and blood goes back to vital organs your heart and your brain. And you learn that protective hoods... despite their important role for hygiene, makes people look like an imbecile. The next day I woke up fresh relaxed and in a good mood. Are you OK my love? I want french fries French fries? With mayonnaise. Good he's good. Tired, but well. I'm going to look at Hugo You can go in, but not all at once. Who will go first? -Go. -Come on guys. Are you sure? Yeah. Hi, Tonio! How are you, Antoine? You look good. He looks good, right? What are you saying? He said, "pi-pi." He can't get up. Veronique went. I'll find a nurse. Quick! Stop! Barrel! A barrel, what are you going to do with a barrel? Are you crazy? Life gave you a second chance! I think he wants to pee. You have to put his penis through the barrel of the container. Oh, Okay. Come on. -Here. -Help Me. He says he needs help. Yes, but he told all of us. Then, Jean-Mich -No. Why me? -You know how it works. I did it to my grandmother once It was awful Laurent. No, I can't. Then it's you Baptiste. You're single Wait a minute. Just because I got dumped do I have to be homosexual. You know what I mean! I'm Married. No, I don't understand what you mean. Yves... He's calling your name. He wants you to do it. The lid. Oh yeah, I forgot Let me help you. Thank you. Raise it a little. A bit more Wait. There you go. What soft hands you have are you excited. Oh my god, it's terrible! I hate you, I hate you! Gentlemen, please. From now on you must be more careful. I have been careful for 50 years! I don't drink, I don't smoke. I exercise, eat healthy, and boom! Why should I be careful? Maybe if you weren't so careful this could have happened much earlier. Or later. Obviously it can happen any time right? That's right. We can not predict it. So this is nonsense. Look, I know that things are not clear. On the contrary Everything is crystal clear. Coronary thrombosis does not have to be a heart attack, it can also be a sign. It's time to make a big change Dad, I need the money for vacation. -How much? -2000. -Wow that's expensive How long will you be gone? Two months. I have a better idea. Go for a month and save a 1000 Euros. Not bad, right? And then you can earn the rest by working Do you understand? I get it, you're not in the mood. No, not really I want you to start thinking about working for a living I know this is new for you, but it can be rewarding. You came back? You should have told me. You can thank your sister and brother. They've done miracles while you were gone. Yes, they are marvelous! By the way, can you arrange an internship for Hugo? Maybe in packaging or something. Let him call me. My grandson, has my number right? You're not going to work in jeans are you? No no I'm not. I just turned 50 and got retired. Nicolas and Sophie will gladly take my part. Here are the company car keys. Oh, and... Good morning, Dad! And good-bye, Dad. I had two things missing in my life: A good cigarette And wandering around. Wandering around is magical. You can go for crazy ideas. like going for a drink with friends in the middle of the day. Just like that! LAURENT BARTHELEMY Real Estate Laurent? Alain, you can not freeze all of my accounts! I can not even pay for my coffee! I can not sell the land! There are no buyers, because there is no tram! The municipality and the political bastards screwed things up! Because the of the tram line, I got screwed! Sorry, sorry I'll calm down. I need just one favor. Nathalie, my wife, she doesn't need to know. She's just recovering I don't want to worry her. Ok I'm counting on you. Thank you. Ever since I met him, for the past 18 years Laurent has not changed. He never talked about his problems. Not his family, not with Nathalie not even with us. Stand up if you support Lyon! We don't need to see the overtime. Yes we won't miss anything. -You should have told me Olivia was coming -You prefer she was with her boyfriend tonight? -So, there is someone then? -No, I didn't say anything. -Let's go eat at Abel? -Yes, I'm starving! -Baptiste? -No, I'm tired. -I'm tired and I forgot my creditcard. Come on, guys! I am celebrating my return to life. I'm paying? Super! Baptiste? Okay. Please can you pass me the pork. Aren't you supposed to be careful after... "Heart Attack" That's whats its called Yes I should be. I have a rehabilitation program. Exercise and a strict diet. -Aren't you following? -No. -Why not? Well that's a very technical point It's very boring. And I don't want to be bored anymore! Theres a good lesson for you Are you wearing glasses? Yes! I'm old and blind as a bat. Steak with french fries please. The stadium doesn't need a thousand roads. I take the left river bank road. After 20 hours I still didn't make it to the Bonaparte bridge! Some fools have gone all the way to Jean Moulin. Those are my fries! If you get stuck behind the tram, good luck. Message at 23 pm? Don't tell me she doesn't have a boyfriend. I'll show you: This is market Bellecour, This is Gerland stadium. And here, Perrache. Now Guess! It took me 10 minutes. Question: which way did I go? Baptiste? Baptiste, which way? I have no idea From the iPhone to the mineral water. Are you crazy? -Olivia. -I am eating -Laurent? -You're eating my fries -A clue for you Shortest route from A to B does not have to be a straight line -What are you doing? -You're such a pig. Why? These are my french fries. If you want them, eat them. Now continue with your fascinating road trip Sorry, I'll be right back. I got news regarding Laurent. His business is doing very badly. The trouble is, he can not sell his land How about Nathalie? -Did she tell you anything? -I don't think she knows. We also don't know we know nothing. Maybe I can help. I have 3500 Euros in my savings account -I can lend him money -You're so sweet But I think it will not be enough. Guys, we have to solve this problem. What does that mean? Are you going to work and bring the tram over there? You can't do that He meant we have to do what we can.. But we have to say something if we want to help He is too proud! If he knows that we know he will be worried and will go away and we'll never see him Why are we hiding it. When I had problems with the short-term loan ... When we had a problem... You guys helped us. That's not the same. No, no this is not the same Laurent is too proud. You can handle it If I say you're a terrible dancer you don't care -I dance really well. Better than you. -You see you complain about it and carry on. There's taking it bad and then taking it bad. But I took this really bad Sorry, but I have a sense of rhythm. Seriously. I am a good dancer. That's how it should be known. -Yes I am a good dancer -No, you're not He's coming. Change the subject. Yves, which is the best way to go to the Airport then? Good question! Thank you, gentlemen! -Thank you, Antoine. -With Pleasure. Jean-Michel, I dance well, right? No, you're terrible. I have to call the landlord in Arcachon for our holiday arrangement for the summer. I'll send the check and you'll pay me later as usual right? Sorry! I can't. I have too much work. With can't come this time. Aren't you coming to Arcachon? Forget Arcachon! I'm tired of the coast! Are you kidding? We go there every year! That's why we need to change something. Look I'll show you something. Wow you have a folding cover! NO idiot, I'm going to show you photos. What is this? What a house and a swimming pool! Where is this? Le Vigan, in Cevennesu. Nice, isn't it? Take a look The rent must be really expensive. Yes, true... But, the deal is. The owners are wealthy friends of Vero's parents And they don't go there at all. They even have heating installed. They want some people there so the house isn't empty So you're saying it's available -And free? -Yes exactly. I'll try to arrange something Worst case I'll bring some work Yes do that! That's a good idea Ok so I have to go now I need to send the nanny home. I'll take a Taxi Or, can you take me home? Yes, of course. Bye! Bye! Have a good night! Wow, what a deal! No, not at all. You don't understand. If we don't do this Nathalie and Laurent can't go on holiday. Too many lies, I can't take it. Well I'm not going to come if Olivia is there. You'll each come for a week. What the hell is this? Laurent sold the Cayenne. 400 km in a Twingo was tough. I ordered the latest model the wait is crazy at Porsche. You guys are early. I found a great route. The navigation wanted to take us through Nemes. Can you imagine? Nemes! -Let's look at the house. -The luggage! Later! Come on, Jean-Mich. Take a look it's magnificent -Where's Laura? -She's taking care of the luggage There's even an ice machine! Good food, great house and good friends. And Lyon beat the Parisians. Yeah! This is proper ice. Everything is here. True monster. Petrus 1989 Olivia is here! Slowly. Hi! I didn't watch the game. I don't want to know! don't tell me. Jean-Michel, did you make the DVD? Of course. Let me go get it. So if you didn't watch it... Please don't say a word. Not even "OK", don't say "OK" Even "OK" can mean something. You really didn't watch the game? Look at him! You look happy. Did we win? No don't say anything. I'm happy because we're on holiday. Marvelous place. A canyon... Lot's of old stone. What's that Champagne? Oh, shit. We won. Didn't we... Yes we won! No don't tell me. -But come on... -No! Are you going to tell me the score! Would you like to know? I am not going to look at your eyes! Olivia, I got it come on. This is crazy Antoine, do we need to thank Vero's parents friends for the house? No, no no need. I'll take care of it You watched the game right? What about Grenierjev's free-kick... Unbelievable! 2 goals in the last minute Damn it! What is happening? This is a documentary. Jean-Michel didn't record the game Yes you're right I'm sorry Maybe they cancelled the game Canceled the game? What are you talking about? You recorded channel 3! It shouldn't be hard to remember. How could you do this! What am I supposed to do with a travel documentary? I told you channel 4! Football on Channel 4! The fourth channel! One more than three. I'm sorry, I'm really sorry. It doesn't matter, don't worry about it. Well then... Tell me the result. Well there were goals Yes, quite a few! Come back here! Don't do this to me! Tell me the score Laurent do you want to go for a swim? Good idea. The pool is ready. True a great idea! Bravo, very funny! Very funny... Vero, what was the score? I didn't know there was a game. No 3G! - "There is no 3G"! I am not even going to ask for Wi-Fi We're up in the mountains with bears. Honey be carefull Don't mess up my hair! I love to hold my breath. -How much can you hold it, Olivia? -I am not interested. Just tell me the score. You really don't know? No, I don't know! -We beat them 3 to 1 -Really? Great! Super! I know. Guillaume is coming tomorrow. What are yours up to? Are they with Baptist? No, they are with my parents. They enjoy going there. And I enjoy myself when they are not with me. Actually may be I can rent them some times. There could be a lot of money in that May be I'm a bad mother too but A true holiday is one without kids Do you remember last year in Arcachon? I really couldn't relax at all Take them kayaking, take them from the club make them Nutella pancakes in the morning I would gladly make pancakes if I could have children No, of course. I'm sorry. Of course we love our children Of course, but sometimes! They can be challenging -You know what? It's raining in Lyon! -Poor Baptiste. Watch out! My feet! Why are you here? I can ask you the same thing. I told you I had first week. No, the first week was mine Come on we'll take care of it. Don't make a scene. Come on we're not 15 anymore. You probably made a mistake. So you leave now, and come back next week -Why should I leave? -Because this is not your week! First week is mine Second week is yours I'll tell you another reason to leave. It's very simple. This is my vacation these are my friends and I would like to have peace and quiet. What do you mean my friends, they're my friends too! Our friendship goes back 25 years I'm the one who introduced them to you Don't be ridiculous we went to school together! Who did you introduce? Don't be ridiculous? Do you wen't to do the math? Yes, if that's necessary Who did you introduce to me? Tell me Yves Yves isn't that right? No I don't remember. You're not going to ruin our holiday are you? We meet him together at the restaurant He was short 50 cents to buy pie. I don't remember the exact bill... Jean-Michel how much was the pie? -2.30 francs. -You see, 2.30 francs. I was right behind him in line. In fact, that makes me first. Really? How about Antoine? You didn't know him before we went skating You're so wrong. We used to go out before I even met you I don't understand. What do you mean we used to go out? Who? No... No, no. -We weren't dating. -No but you said... "We used to go out". That was the word. Antoine? Why didn't you tell me this earlier? Baptiste, you're making a big deal out of this It was nothing. It was meaningless You've hid it from me for 25 years a quarter of a century therefore it is an important secret. Otherwise, you would say: "Baptiste you know we had sex before we met... but it was nothing" then I would have replied "It doesn't matter" It was ages ago come on... Oh just what I was waiting for the magic words "Ages ago" time heals everything I fucked your wife... but ages ago I poked your eye... ages ago I raped your mother... but ages ago Stop! In fact, we only slept together. -Technically we didn't... -Stop. Too much information. What's the problem? You were not married to Olivia, I wasn't married to Antoine Actually I knew about it but I didn't care. Ahh, you also knew? So I'm the only clown. Is this a conspiracy? Today for example I don't care if Olivia sees someone. Are you? I don't care. But before... No Not with a friend. Not in the past. This is about having respect. We're on holiday We came to relax. To enjoy. But this requires respect. I am not asking for much. I hope you finished and you're not going to talk about this all the time I said what I had to say. End of story. Okay, I'm going back to the pool. Baptiste... The rain ends... then the sun shines again. Don't comfort me with proverbs. We need another room Baptist and Olivia need separate ones. Just take care of it. Why us? Are we cursed, just because we got divorced? -We didn't get divorced. -Don't start it again. -There is an attic with a bed at the back. -It sounds great! I won't sleep in an attic, no matter how good they are. I can take it if you want. You're so sweet, but we'll figure something out. We didn't pick rooms yet Actually... We... We already unpacked and it would be silly to move. Naturally you chose the best room overlooking the swimming pool? No... we got here first... so... I'm sorry if I chose a better route! Enough with your routes! The thing is you always come first and take the best room. Just because you unpacked, doesn't mean that the room is yours. Hello dark clouds. No no... nothing is spoiled. But after 25 years of silence it had to be said... right? Of course. I have a suggestion.. that we play a game for the rooms. Petang. -Come on Baptise we can't wait all night! -Fuck off! I am going to get more wine Damn! What the hell are you doing? I am warning you. We'll go to a hotel. I will not sleep in the barn! -It's not a barn an attic. -Whatever, same thing. Olivia was a pretty girl. Polite and well brought up. And now she was about to finish a whole bottle of rose... or maybe not. Antoine is the closest.. then Baptiste. You will regret that you have an ass Why is that? Because I'm going to screw you Olivia you moved Baptiste's ball. He lost. Come on! This is cheating! She screws me everywhere in life! Antoine, did you take your medicine! Wow.. our first sangria on vacation! Super! Jean-Mich, you are a great guy. You prepare cocktails you can fix things with your hands. No thanks I'll continue with the rose We'll pass it on You're every womans dream But seriously... how's the love department -Come on tell us. There's something going on... -Give him a break! -Come on spill it out -Are you seeing someone? Actually I am really excited There is a gril She came just before the holiday to change her brake pads She's about 38 years old Very pretty and sophisticated. She has a hand bag And...? She's really beautiful. Marvelous news! Will you see her? Pads have a 3-year warranty, she'll be back but not so soon Come on! Do you know her name? I guess it's on the invoice Wait a minute. What did you tell her? That she has a 3-year warranty. No but... romantically? I don't know. We didn't talk like that. -It's getting serious I think -Very sexy Brake pads, a hand bag, beautiful girl I think I'll go and masturbate Oh.. come on Antoine... But seriously guys the sangria is divine. Really? Let me try. It smells very nice Aren't you going to have a glass? One minute Jean-Mich This is not a joke, it's outstanding I am not a sangria guy but Whatever is inside this... What did you put in this? The wine you brought and another stuff: Oranges, cinnamon, sugar Which wine? The wine from the kitchen. The one you showed us Not the two bottles I put on the table right? Yeah those Please say "I didn't put Chateau Petrus" in there Good God! You didn't put a 89 Chateau Petrus in our sangria did you? You were supposed to use the table wines from the box next to them Damn, Jean-Michel. How could you? Do you know how much a bottle costs? Sorry, Yves. Sorry. I'll pay for it Not it's not about money Jean-Mich Just... Damn! I mean... What the hell did you do! I really am a fool. No, your'e not. No, I forbid you to talk like that about any of my friends. You are not a fool. Yves, you've already had enough Petrus in your life You know what this is? This is unique! There is nobody who drank a Petrus sangria in the world! The best sangria in the world. You'll remember this sip. For the rest of your life Therefore enjoy it. Isn't that right? Enjoy! It really is outstanding Yes I'm sure Bravo, Jean-Mich! Cheers! Watch out! I'm coming! It's very hot! Is everything okay? Isn't it funny? When I'm on vacation, I can eat a peace of toast or a baugette There are no rules! Shopping list. -Good Morning, Yves. -Hi, Vero. How many are you going to eat? That's just butter and grease. It's not good for you Why are you eating that? Because it's good! You forgot cream and vodka. Yes, and you forgot your pills. Vero can you put the butter in the fridge, it shouldn't stay in the sun. The sun can really ruin it Last time we forgot something with Laura outside and the sun... boiled it. Are you going shopping? Let's take the Picasso. I don't know why but Yves decided, taht shopping in the morning was our morning ritual. Whats worse than Yves at breakfast is Yves in the car Tires are full. I always buy Goodyear. I never bought another brand. What about you? What is your favourite manufacturer? Because the liver of the polar bear is extremely toxic. No Eskimo will ever eat it. None. Guillaume is here! Nice of him. The holiday at Vigan did him good. Son! You should have told us. We could have picked you up. How are you, father? -Your father is quite lively. -The eternal flatterer -Good to see you! -You too Come on to the abbey We have to go Super. Are you coming Guillaume? No, I have to finish my homework Too bad. Antoine, we're going to the abbey The Abbey? Why? It's nice here Go without me You can't get a tan in the abbey And monks always look miserable and they are very pale I don't want to leave the sun You know, I'm on the "market" now... I have to stay with her and supervise, incase something happens to her We don't do anything together all year long Vacation is not only relaxing and drinking -I think that's exactly what it is -That's the definition of vacation! Did we come 480 km's just to to walk around and see things? This is a classic Cistercian style You immediately feel the influence of Enguerrand de Lusigny, A very old style. Strong pillars. They knew how to build True, honey. You really are a great match Ahh you're so kind Thank you, Antoine. Since you wondered The Cistercian monks were committed to an oath of silence Wonderfull.. we should respect their oath. -Antoine can we talk -Do I have a choice Listen. When folding Guillaumov's tent I found this in the side pocket -It's drugs. -You don't say I don't know what to do. It doesn't look good I am only his father and he doesn't listen to me anymore Would you like to talk to to him? -What do you want me to say? -I don't know. Tell him he's being ridiculous You're his godfather he will listen to you I lit one for my mom. You want one? Please take one it's on me Thank you. What did you wish for? But you're not supposed to tell Why not? Who's gonna know Your ritual is no fun Yes. Wait a minute. Does this mean I'll have to sell our house? Am I supposed to tell Nathalie, that we lost the house? Alain please. I told you before I am waiting for the councils decision It's coming in a month! You can't wait that long? Ok. Call me. Are you going to talk to Guillaume. Thank you He put too much coal The fire won't be able to breathe And the twigs are green. You always have to use clean dry branches. Or pine cones Or maybe saw dust That will not do. Laurent, are you okay? I'm sorry... I had a terrible sleep I'm very tired. You know what? Forget the barbecue. I saw a restaurant, where they have great Aioli No Aioli please! It's greasy and with too much garlic. I made some vegetable stew Vegetables vegetables! Let's have some local food A nice Aioli would be great for lunch Guys, you do what you want We are going to stay here. -Exactly Come on don't be silly It is a pity! See you girls! I'm really sorry. Forget about it. -The profiteroles were great -Lets see Great. The wine is on the house Nice. And we got a discount. So per person divided by five. 9,20 euro per person. It's almost free Super. What? 9.20? Do you know them? Didn't I tell you? The owner is a friend of Vero's friends which offered us the house. Francis and Nicole. That's great really great Thank you for your generosity! It's Great, really! Nice of you. Thank you. I will send Francis and Nicole your regards. Thank you for your kindness. Thank you very much. I'll bring mentha for everyone I wan't a mentha cocktail but really cold Jean-Mich, bring some ice! -Honey? -I want some Calva Are you going to drink more? I love the color. Antoine you just had a coronary artery problem Why are you risking your life? Don't worry, you will be a beautiful widow. Sorry, we're going to bed. Come on, Antoine. You are not my mother. My mother is dead. Listen to me. I won't take this bitchy wife role. Go find someone else to play with Good night. Come on! I was kidding! I was kidding! Don't look at me like that! I did the math If you could put all the paper you sold you could have a road to the moon and back Amazing isn't it? I am going to see my friends at Montpellier -Have a nice day. -See you tonight. -Is Olivia leaving? -Help me? Thanks! -Where is she going? -To go see friends -What friends? -Friends in Montpellier In Montpellier? We don't have friends there Perhaps she met new ones. You should be happy She won't be here all day We don't have friends in Montpellier. Honey, you have to transfer the money. I have to make the payment today Sorry, I forgot. I will handle it Look you can even make crushed ice. Cool, isn't it? Excellent for mojito. Did you see the crushed ice? Why are you crying? Nothing.. nothing. It's the onion. But those are carrots Maybe she met someone on the beach. It happens you know It's hot... there's the sun People are in bathing suits, almost naked... It happened to my former boss in Norautu Or was it in Speedy? I don't remember No, Norautu Just before Midasom. And? Your boss? Yeah, like Oliva. He met his wife on the beach. They got married Had two children. Remind me not to speak to you anymore Honey are you having a good time? -No don't eat that, that's for Olivia! -She should have been here then... But she's at the beach Yeah? At night? The time is 22:50. What is she doing at this time on the beach? Did she buy a metal detector. Is she searching for gold? You fool! Perhaps she's with a new boyfriend. The beach is romantic. It's Full Moon. The important thing is not to be jealous! I'm not jealous. I really don't care at all! It is only about respect. That's all I'm trying to say There are rules you know. You can't have sex in the same region! -Don't talk like that in front of Guillaume! -Sorry. But you're not in the same region. She is in Montpellier the 34th region You are in Gard, the 30th region It doesn't matter they're almost the same So your rule applies to neighbouring regions too then Are you okay sweetheart? Are you bored? No, no. It doesn't look good Are you going to talk to him? About the Drug situation. Yes, I will. Don't worry. Can I have some more wine, please? Laurent are you thirsty. You drink too much tonight Yes. He's relaxing We're on holiday. I'm relaxing Ahh finally, there is Olivia! Am I late... sorry. I'm starving. I was on the beach all day I made some vegetable casserole Would you like some? I'm going to take a shower. I have sand all over Full of sand. Come on! That's for Olivia! Oops, sorry. -Is it good? -Excellent I'm so happy! What did you do today? I had a wonderful time! Super. That is not an answer. At least you can be polite and answer the question. This is called respect. What's up with you? Suddenly are you interested in my life? Previously if I left for the moon you wouldn't bother to ask why That's not true. You live your own life, I live my own Is that what you want? Is that what you want? Yes why not? Hi! Did my father send you? Yes. I know why. Because of this? How old are you? 19? I missed your birthday It was on the 10th of April You were in a coma. Excellent excuse You know, Guillaume... I made a lot of mistakes. I did not have enough fun. I was too carefull I never enjoyed life. And at 50 years old I still had a heart attack. Your best years are still yet to come. But this... You only realize much later Therefore I'll give you a secret Have fun. Go to clubs, have sex. Eat at McDonalds Drink Coke, the red one with sugar not zero But mainly: Forget about common sense. I think he understood. The message has been delivered. What is this? Did he charge you for that? I asked you to talk to him, and you made him a dealer You're completely crazy! I gave him the money for his birthday. I confiscated the drugs. You should be happy. Your son is a great kid. Super boy. I'm stoned. -I can see that -Have some I haven't had one for ages Thank you.

Do I look like an inflatable doll? You are rude, you're drunk you stink and you want to have sex Wow that really turns me on! You are not fun. You are old... like your sister Never again... We will never smoke pot again. Drugs are evil! I dreamed that I married a wild boar. What does that mean? Are you going to the village? Can you get me cigarettes Did you cancel your appointment with Fabrice Blomet. Your cardiologist, professor Blomet. You had a review scheduled for the 12th -That is today. -Don't remember?

Hey Wait In times of difficulty it's good to be alone to look at a landscape and the horizon. it helps you assess the situation. But in fact, it becomes really boring after three minutes. Antoine did you buy eggs for the trip? Did you call Blomet and cancel your appointment? Why didn't you want me to come? I don't know. I didn't want to talk. We don't always have to talk -You don't talk to others too sometimes -I know. But when I don't talk to the others I don't get so annoyed Do you get annoyed when we don't talk? -Just say I'm annoying you and it's all over -No no. Forget it. Wait wait. You said I annoy you. -Aren't we friends anymore? -Yves, I don't know. What do you want me to say? The stories you tell that they are boring and that you don't make me laugh you used to be fun Now, you're not funny. I'm not funny? Forget what I said. Come on. Faster, Laura! -I'm trying! -Don't forget what I told you One small step one big step One small step one big step Let's break for lunch!

I'm boring and not funny Thats what Antoine told me yesterday -You're joking! -Not at all not. Come on I didn't say terrible things We should be able to tell the truth right? We have so many people to lie to Our family, work colleagues, neighbours We should be able to tell that we are bored It's not a big deal This is life. We're getting old This happens to old friends. Anyone for radish? My little chicks Jean-Mich. I think I cooked them right It'll be excellent with mayonnaise. Baptiste? Yves. Wings or breast? I don't eat chicken -Why not? -I don't like it. What do you mean you don't like chicken Are you a vegetarian? Laura, doesn't your husband like chicken? -I don't know. -I don't like it. Isn't that enough? Well, as you wish. But I just I don't believe you. Everyone loves chicken On the grill, boiled, fried You don't want it because I cooked it And you're angry at me. Tell me Admit it, you're mad at me! Damn, Antoine enough! Since you had the heart attack... enough! You're always preaching, like you know siht But no.. don't... And don't call Me Jean-Mich anymore It's Jean-Michel or Jean-Mi.

In fact, you are all perfect Don't change a thing. You're all awesome.

Nothing serious -Good morning, Hugo . -Hi, dad. Are you really in the packaging department No I moved to marketing...

The rules you know You have to respect them I tried to quit it for some time but it seems... I can't do without it. No, sir. Laurent, please. 9 of us... Oh by the way, I found the house where we went to on the internet They were your parents friends right, Vero? It seems they decided to rent it out and at a very high price too Probably because it's their first time. Then we're very lucky So the bill comes to 9.20 per person. Come on don't mess with us! How much? Seriously. 9.20 per person. I can have plans too you know I didn't tell you guys The Tram line is extended. All the way to my lands Great! So everything is fine. How I fooled you! Thank you, friends! After a bottle of cognac we decided to go home No one was sober enough to drive All 9 of us tried to fit in Yves car. We were together, we were friends having fun carelessly. But at the first roundabout a disaster happened Yves took a wrong turn. BARBECUE
