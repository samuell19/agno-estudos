My Godmother! My Godmother, she needs help! I'm a nurse. Let me check on her. It's my Godmother. She was at the wheel and she had a dizzy spell. We called the ambulance. They're going to be here any minute. One minute we were driving... You're in shock. You need to relax a little bit. We need you to calm down. Okay. Okay. Are you all right? Yeah, I just bounced around a bit. Did you hit your head, or anything? No no. No no. How are you feeling? Not bad for stage four pancreatic cancer. And you? Fran! How is she doing? Well, there's no head trauma. Her vital signs are okay. The ambulance is on the way. Well I guess I won't hold my breath. Considering happy hour isn't for a few hours yet. Hey Sarah, you think you might do something about getting that pushed up a bit, so I could, like, calm the nerves a little. Right? Oh Daphne, how are you sweetheart? You okay? I'm a bit of a wreck. But I'm in one piece. Hey, how about that book? Did Elizabeth and Mr Darcy survive the crash? She is such a Jane Austen fan. Obsessed with a happy ending, that one. Really Fran? You want to tease me now? Every chance I get. I don't have a lot of time, you know. Well you sound like yourself so she must be okay. You know what? Daphne, promise me that you will never let me die in an ambulance. They are not dignified. I work at the hospital. I'll go with you. Oh. You think you might want to come with me, to the West Coast? I can leave Daphne and her book here. I mean, truth be told, I drive her crazy. Okay. Well I'm sorry Fran, but I'm with you until the bitter end. That's not a long commitment. We're okay. You're okay. She's okay. All right. And your relationship to the injured party is... Fran is my Godmother. Okay. Godmother, Fran, was driving? Yes. Okay, I just need to make sure it wasn't you. I don't drive. I get panic attacks when I'm behind the wheel. Oh, good call on the no driving, then. Umm... The purpose of the trip? We're driving to the West Coast to scatter her late husband's ashes. - Oh, sorry about that. - His name was Frederick. Okay, that might be too many details for a traffic report. But don't you want all the facts? Yes. All the actual, relevant facts, ma'am. They got engaged on the West Coast under the setting sun. A love to last a lifetime. You're not writing. I'm listening. I scored ten out of ten on my sensitivity training. Understood. I'm writing my thesis, so my head is really deep into details. My professor wants evocative storytelling. I see. By the way, where are we exactly? Have we reached the Midwest? Exactly. Town of Greenwood. Sugar? Caffeine? Thank you. Yes. What about you, Paul? Huh? Not every cop likes donuts, Matt. I'm so sorry. I've got everything I need. This is basically an insurance matter. - Are you sure? - Yup. Can you just suspend her licence? I need to convince her not to continue. No. But you can try the doctor. We have an update on that tow truck. It should arrive in a few minutes. Roger that. Um, thanks for the offensive offer, Matt. Uh ma'am, your tow truck will be here any minute, okay. - Thanks. - You bet. Okay. Do you have a phone number of a taxi service I could call? I can give you a ride to the hospital. It's not far. Not that anything is in Greenwood. Oh. Thank you. I appreciate it. Daphne Merlotte. Matthew Greene. Matt. - My truck's right over here. - Okay. Hey Matt! Now I know it's not quite a motorhome, but it will get us from point A to point B. Thank you so must. The least I can do. Do you think Fran looked all right? I mean I know she wasn't bleeding, but... I think she might of hit her head on the steering wheel. She always pretends she's as tough as she's always been. I'm sure she'll be fine. Sarah would've called if she wasn't. Right. Yeah. That makes me feel better. No, no, no it doesn't. I'm still, I'm still worried about her. Like I am every minute of every day. We have an excellent hospital. She'll get great care. She's my family. She raised me. Right alongside her son. I still can't believe we're going to lose her. So you're from the East Coast, huh? Yeah. - I saw your licence plate. - Yeah. Yeah. I've actually never been to this part of the country. People seem friendly. Ah, Greenwood's a friendly place. We all look out for one another. Well, I have to admit Fran picked a pretty nice place to wreck. Well, friendly or not, you might want to keep a low profile. After all, you almost did run into our only donut shop. Thanks for the heads up. I'll warn Fran. I am as fit as a fiddle. If the fiddle had terminal cancer. I meant as far as being not dizzy and able to drive. You just need to rest Fran. Oh well. If only I had help. Do not look at me. I cannot drive. I have never driven. I never will. She's referring to the accident. Which was years ago. And it was just that, an accident. Hannah would want you to drive. To live your life, to enjoy. Whoa whoa whoa whoa! Fran. You need to rest. I will rest after I bring my Frederick to the West Coast. Frederick? Who's Frederick? Her late husband. I promised to spread his ashes at the exact spot where he proposed to me. May I ask... why the fire extinguisher? His company manufactured them. So I thought it would be fitting to give him a good SSSSSSSSSspray. Come on. Classic. Fran, you are my new favorite patient. As long as you... Stay in bed. Okay. Well, you are my favorite doctor. But I just have a question. Do you have any handsome single men for my Daphne? Fran! No I mean are there any social events that we could attend? - Now? - No, for real. I mean we could stick around for a bit. I think you're pulling me into dangerous territory. I'll check back up on you in a while. I see someone's feeling much better. Well there's nothing wrong with us, checking out the local prospects. You're never going to find a real life Mr Darcy with your nose in those books all the time. I don't need men, okay. I just need you to be safe. But I don't want you to be alone when I'm gone. Okay. Let's just get you better and take care of Frederick. You need your own Frederick. - I love you. - I love you too. I'm going to go see about the motorhome. It was just a scratch! Optimist! Okay, fine, listen. When you're out there, just do me a favor and take a look around, because you never know. You might find something handsome. Will do. Right after I finish writing my thesis. See you soon. Matt? Hey. Hey. How's your Godmother? Oh, she's good. She's pretending to sleep. How are you holding up? I'm pretty worried. Yeah. I'm just trying to figure out everything I have to do, you know. How badly is the motorhome damaged? Where did they even tow it? Can I still sleep in it? And the big question is... how do I get Fran to stop driving too soon? Well, umm... I can try to answer a couple of those questions for you. That motorhome of yours is built like a tank. There's some minor front end damage, the chassis is still intact, and no major engine issues to speak of. Well, that's good news, right? How do you know all this? Oh, I'm the mechanic in town who's repairing it. Really? I wasn't expecting that. Yeah they towed it to my yard. So, to answer your last question... Yes, you can sleep in it tonight. In fact, that's why I'm here. I figured you could use a ride? Thank you, Matt. And are you good at body work? Best in town. Come on. You're working hard. Looks like you are too. Yeah. It's nice to be off the road. Just sit down, work on my thesis. Masters or PhD? I'm doing my PhD on the economic circumstances of women in Jane Austen novels. Ah. So Jane Austen, huh? Is she any good? You've heard of Jane Austen? The English author. Pride and Prejudice? Ah, I'm really more of a magazine guy myself. What? - Tell me about this, what is it? - Pride and Prejudice. Pride and Prejudice. Yeah, yeah. Tell me about that. Well, it's her classic novel, written in the early nineteenth century. It's been made into a movie countless number of times. I'm sure you've seen one of them? I will add it to my queue immediately. Oh. You are missing out. She is the great literary expert on love. Oh what, so, she's got it figured out better than the rest of us train wrecks? Yes. She does. Well in that case, maybe I should read her. Oh, you should. Start with this one. So, Pride and Prejudice. Then Sense and Sensibility, Persuasion, Mansfield Park... Wow, you've got me figured out. Caffeine and English lit, my two favorite vices. Okay, you think I'm exaggerating but she really delved into areas like how challenging it was for women to change their station in life. How advantageous marriages were one of the few levers women had to change their fates because society never allowed women the same opportunities as men. All that's in here? Yeah. Huh. Sounds relevant. So she really helped you figure love out? Yeah. Yeah. Well, nineteenth century love. But I think you would like her take on human nature, good and bad. Yeah, maybe I would. She's funny. Even Fran likes her. Well, I don't know much about Fran, but I can tell she can find the humor in any situation. Yeah. I've never met anyone like her. She's a force. You mentioned she helped raised you. Yeah. She and my mom were best friends. My parents were killed in a car accident when I was a kid. I'm sorry to hear that. Fran, Frederick and their son took me in without hesitation. It's tough enough for most people have to lose one Mom, let alone two. I just shared more with you about that than anyone else. I don't know why I did that. I'm very sorry. Oh, no no no. Actually, it was, it was great. Tell me, is that something that a Jane Austen character would do? Yeah. Share their deepest, most honest feelings? Yes, but usually after a series of misunderstandings and mix-ups, and then they usually they end up getting... What? What do I owe you for coffee and everything? - Don't even... - No no no. - Don't worry about it. - No no no. You've done so much. I tell you what, you educate me on all things Jane Austen. We'll call it even. Deal? All right. Deal. Well, I better get back to work. Otherwise you'll never leave Greenwood. Okay. I know you're in a hurry. I'll grab the bag. Argh! Yes! You think you're out the door when suddenly someone very tiny decides to have a very impromptu diaper change. Thanks for taking her last minute. Of course. It's the least I can do. New customer? Yeah. Hi there! Wait. I brought you something. What? Ahhh! Caffeine on ice! You know what I like. Let me get her. There you go. Oh yes. I got her. Let's go. Come on. Thank you, Matty! Yeah, of course. Drive safe, Brit! - Love ya! - Yeah, love you too. All right. Come on. Let's go. We get to play in the backyard. Who's this? Say hello to baby Emma. Hello! Yeah, when we were waiting on her. Couldn't sleep a wink. It was just... so many things that can go wrong. Oh, she was worth the wait. Aww. She's as beautiful as your wife. Yeah, she does look a lot like my sister. Your niece! Your niece. - Yeah. - Yeah, yeah. I try to help out wherever I can. She is really, really precious. Yeah, she is. So is my sister. You know, we lost our Mom a couple of months ago. And we really never know our Dad, so we look out for each other. You grew up without a Dad, too? Yeah, yeah. I don't get it how you can have kids and just leave. Not say goodbye. I should put her down for a nap. Okay. Okay. That's my girl. Bye bye. Hey Judy. Well, if you've come to run away with me to some place exotic, the answer is, yes. And deprive the good people of Greenwood of a top notch librarian? Never. Best in the tri-state area. Maybe even national. So, I heard about you and the motorhome lady. Already? All anyone can talk about is how the motorhome crashed into the donut shop. And how the driver was taken to hospital. - Well, news travels fast. - Always! So tell me about the other woman. Hey, did that book come in for me yet? You are a subject changer. Tell me about the one who wasn't driving. I also need Jane Austen. Pride and... Prejudice! I love that book. Follow me... to the back. It's classic lit. Oh! Are you sure you're going to read this? Well, maybe. I hear it's funny. You're funny. Hey Judy. Hi. - Matthew. - Hi Paul. Just grabbing some summer reading. Cool. I enjoy a thriller too, in the summer months myself. Paul, mysteries are on the back wall, as you know. Yes, but your recommendations are the best. It's almost like you read me like a book. Umm... Are you going to the strawberry single social? Haven't you button down for the occasion? - Yeah, you look nice. - Oh, thank you. Yeah. Is this new? - Um... - The shirt? - No. - Oh. I'm not sure why that is such a difficult question. I'm not sure... Is it repaired? Is it not repaired? Why can't you just answer me? - It's not ready. - Why not? It should be. Because it takes time. You crashed it. Let's talk about it later. Right exactly. Thank you driver. You're not ready to travel, Fran. Says you. Why are you so stubborn? Does the hospital even know you left? They'll figure it out. Until then, I am going to a lake on the West Coast so I can spray my Frederick all over the waves and die happy! I need time to think about continuing this journey. Really? You need time? Because I was thinking this could help with your decision. Fran! Fran Fran Fran Fran Fran Fran Fran. What do you think? What are you doing with my book? I am releasing you from its grip. Don't you think that's great? I think it's great. You know I can buy a new one. You know what. It's the summer. Take a break. Less reading, more living. Okay? Thank you. That's your favorite book after all. Hey! Don't give that back to her. I worked hard on prying that out of her hands. And anyway. Who are you? This is Matthew. I drove her to the hospital. You drove together? I mean, did she talk to you? Because she doesn't talk to me when I drive. And I need lively conversation. You know what I mean? Like some back and forth banter. Some love! But she's always got her face stuck in a book. What are you talking about Fran? We talk all the time. Even the doctor said you needed at least a few more days to adjust to your new medication levels. Come on. Please. Okay, well, that's it. Whoa! Whoa! Oh Matthew, Matthew. I was really hoping we'd be able to take what's happening between us to the next level. You know, I really, I really felt like I found someone I could take care of and who could take care of me. But I guess we'll never know for sure what could have been. It's going to be so hard to leave you. After our long wonderful talks. And snuggling on your swing. Heart breaking, heart breaking, really. Daphne, you are not fooling anybody. Fran! Fran! Fran? Fran! You know, Daphne. I was just thinking, we could delay our departure. It just hit me. Just like that. You know, maybe Matthew could use some lemonade. Matthew, do you like lemonade? I, I, like lemonade. Perfect. Perfect. Come in. Come on. Both of you. Daphne has a secret ingredient to her lemonade. See if you can guess what it is. Nobody ever does. Fran, Fran. Matt doesn't care what's in the lemonade. Do you, dear? Uh, maybe? Figure it out. Come on. I'm learning a lot about myself now. I should get going, so... I'll call when we stop. No no no no. There's really no rush. We're fine. But we need to get to the coast. No, no. No! I need to rest, Daphne! I can't believe that you're going against doctor's orders. Are you forgetting? Okay. Let's talk about it after I say goodbye to Matt. Goodbye to Matt. All right. Shhhh, shhhh, shhh. I'm so sorry. I shouldn't have done that. I wasn't opposed to it. No, no! I'm giving you the wrong impression. Actually it was a good impression. Keep walking. I panicked. So when you panic you kiss virtual strangers? - No. It's not like that. - Explain it to me. Hold me. I'll owe you. That's quite the explanation. Okay. I wasn't ready to get back on the road with her. She's not ready to drive. I was desperate. So she won't leave if you kiss someone? Fran won't leave if I'm trying to have a relationship. She's wants me to date more. But I'm taking working and I'm taking care of her. And... I'm not good at it! Well, nobody's good at it. You seem pretty dateable to me. I do? She's watching. There. That should convince her. - Who? - Fran. What about her? That we're fake dating. Yes. Yes yes yes. Oh, okay. Um, I will explain later. You're not angry? If you think more kissing will convince her, I'm willing to do whatever it takes. I appreciate it. Can I see you tonight? There's an ice cream parlor a couple of blocks from here. It's the best pistachio in town. - Okay. Six? - Sure thing. Okay. Thank you so much. Thank you. You know, I can't believe you didn't want to try the pistachio? Oh no. It's underneath the chocolate. The chocolate sauce? Yep. The chocolate sauce, chocolate ice cream, chocolate sprinkles, chocolate cookie. Yup. It's pretty delicious. I don't share with just anyone. But I'm trusting you on the pistachio. It never disappoints. You can even ask my ex-fake girlfriend. Okay, I had to do something. I just couldn't face driving through the mountains with Fran. - I'm sorry. - For what? I got a couple of great kisses out of it. Fran has never seen me have a serious relationship. Because I've never had one. She's just trying to take care of me, you know. And she doesn't want me to be alone. Ah, so if she sees you in a serious relationship she'll postpone this whole drive? I didn't know what else to do. Her doctor says she just needs another week or so to rest. Well, I've seen how stubborn Fran is. Don't forget. I saw the crash too. Look, if it keeps Fran and others, including you, out of harm's way, I'm all about it. Thank you. Well, as a back-up plan, in case she insists, you should really let me teach you to drive. Oh no. Not going to happen. Driving phobia. What about my phobia about her driving you two off the side of a mountain? Okay. That's horrible. It's also possible. Look for her safety and yours, you need to learn how to drive. You have a point. All right. Yeah. I have to learn how to drive. I have faith in you. You can do it. Oh, and... Got you a little something. Austen! "I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading. How much sooner one tires of anything than a book!" Look, I just saw it in a bookstore window. Thought maybe you could use a replacement. It's perfect. Thank you. So do me one favor. Can you reassure me, please that you like the pistachio? Yeah! I like it. But I really like that you're sharing it with me. Oh, um, excuse me. Do you mind? Could you just take a photo of us? I can show Fran how in love, 'we' are. Because pictures never lie. Hi Uncle Matt! Marshall! My man! What night is tonight? - Greene Family night! - Greene Family night. You got that right. And I think I brought... Yeah, I did. Hey Britt. So, lemonade, anyone? Can you just finish the story! I'm repairing her motorhome. And then she kisses me. Sure. That's all. Just repairing the motorhome. And then smooch. Uh huh. Oh and her Godmother is starting to get bored. So I stretched the truth a little bit, and said I'm waiting on parts. I heard that there was ice cream. You shared yours, she shared hers. You shared your pistachio? Greene family night is not supposed to be about my love life. It is when the entire town sees you out with the woman who almost smashed into our donuts and coffee. Technically, she was the passenger. So, who's ready to eat, huh? Well, well well. Kissy face. Ah ha ha. You kissed someone, you kissed someone. - Marshall! - You should work on this. It is not a good social skill. Yeah, but you did kiss someone. Okay, so who's ready to eat? Hmm? - Pizza! - Who wants pizza? Hmmm. I thought you had a date with Mr Greene. Oh oh. Yeah yeah yeah! I can't wait. Look he gave me this book. Daphne, I thought you were meeting at five. Yeah. Daphne, it's 4:45. You really shouldn't get so engrossed in your reading. You have a date. Oh. Yeah yeah. Yeah. - Really? - I'll see you later. Oh. What? Like that? Oh, yeah. Yes, okay. Better? - Much. - Right. Okay. Wait wait wait. You're going on a date with your laptop? Oh yeah. Oh oh. Matt loves to hear about my writing. He asks all the time. He's just great like that. Okay. Bye. That girl is crazy. No Matt tonight? Pardon me? Oh, um, I'm a good friend of his. Judy. Daphne. No Matt tonight. Just doing some work. You didn't break up did you? No no no no. But let's just say, it's complicated. I hope things get uncomplicated. Everybody loves Matt. He's been here his whole life. You know, he's never left town. - Never? - Not even for a holiday. Okay. That does not mean he doesn't have an adventurous soul. A wild and uninhibited soul. Ever since we were in grade school he used to talk about a girl who blows into town and sweeps him off his feet. That is quite a fine piece of fiction, Paul, but I'm sure that Daphne will get to know the real Matthew during these sweet honey first days of romance. Yeah, we renaissance men need to stick together. You know. Just letting Daphne in on his dreams. It wouldn't be the first time as Matthew's cupid wing man. Oh that was back in grade school with Jennifer Steinman. Boom! There. Validation. We're always so much in sync. Well, I will just leave you two in memory lane. I have a lot of work I need to finish up. By the way, beautiful wifi here, Judy. Oh, well thank you. We are roaring into the digital age. She's funny. I, ah, have some new thrillers that you would love. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Okay. - Come with me. Yeah. Sure. Okay. Good. Frederick? Sweetheart? I love you, Fran. But what are we going to do? Fran? When you go off to law school... What if you meet somebody else? That would be bad luck for you. There's a good chance you'll meet someone who is smarter, better looking. Or someone who's less smart, worse looking. No, I mean, like, a gentleman who's rich and tall. What nonsense. We fit together, Fran. Like forever. What are you saying? You have no common sense at all. No. None whatsoever. But neither do you. It's a blessing. It's a blessing. I love you. You eat like you're on a desert island. Dessert island. It's pretty delicious here. Does the offer still stand? What offer? To teach me how to drive. - Uh huh. - Great. When can we start? In about four minutes. As soon as I finish these. Okay. - Bite? - No. - Thank you. - Your loss. Ta da! - Your turn. - My turn? - Yeah. - Now? Right now. No better time than the present. Unless it's tomorrow. Then that's a better time. Do you want to do this another time? No. Now is perfect. Oh. Okay. Okay. - Okay. - After you. Watch your feet. It's Brittany's car. You can't hurt it. And even if you do, I'll fix it. Yeah. Okay. I'll tell you what. Leave the car off, throw it in neutral, I'll just push it. Okay. That way you can get a feel for it while you're steering. It's totally safe. You know what? I feel like you've done this before. How do you think Brittany learned to drive? - Ready? - Just not too fast, okay? I will try and keep it under sixty. Okay.

Let's go. - I'll take you. - Okay. He pushed you around a parking lot? Yeah. And, I was pretty good. You finally get into a relationship and you nearly give him a heart attack. Fran, I know you don't like that I can't help you with driving. And I want to be able to. That would be good for me. And your independence. So where are you two lovebirds going this evening? Dinner. Just dinner, Fran. Oh, well I said 'lovebirds' and you blushed. - Did not. - Did too. - Did not. - Did too. And I think it's great. I am so happy for you. Come with us. No no. I've got another nap on the agenda. You go. Okay. Bye Fran. Where are we going? Well, it's my birthday. It's your birthday? Why didn't you tell me? Well, I didn't know if you'd still want to go. Go? Go where? To my sister's. Like, I wasn't sure if meeting my family was part of the whole fake relationship thing. Yeah, it's not. But before you say no, I promise we're a really fun family. How fun? Board games and chocolate cake fun. Yup. I'm in. Come on. They're nice. I'm not sure I should've come. They're going to look at me like I'm your actual date. Let them stare. That's half the fun with us. It's also why I didn't tell them you were coming. You didn't tell them? I told baby Emma, and she already likes you. Okay. Okay. What's your name again? It's Daphne. Like the duck? No, that's Daffy. Excuse me. I don't feel well. Hey, why don't we go check on mommy, huh. We'll put you to bed. Excuse me. So, is your last name is Greene, too? No. My last name is Merlotte. But this is Greene Family Night. It's for Greenes. I see your logic. Although, I am the guest of a Greene. A Greene guest. Okay! So did you kiss? Maybe we should just change the subject. Sorry about that. Lunch must've disagreed with me. Daphne, can I get you a glass of wine? Please. Thank you. I'm just going to... What's going on with you? Are you sick? I'm fine. Are you sure? Yeah. Stop worrying. And by the way, thanks for the advance notice that you were bringing a date. Well on this special day, Matt gets to have his cake and eat it too. Where do the sheeps go for vacation? To the Baaaaahamas! What's the subject of your PhD? The role of economics in Jane Austen's novels. Sounds like a page turner. For about ten people, it is. Yeah. You said it's rooted in equality and fairness in society. Who gets opportunities and who doesn't. I couldn't have put it better myself. So... how's the driving going? It's more like sitting so far. Well, it's a good way to start. It helped to relieve me of my white knuckle syndrome. So... Daphne, you are an academic, three years into your post doctorate, and you are going on a cross country road trip. Yes. Now, Matt never liked school, he reads car and truck magazines, and he doesn't like traveling at all. Okay, so now this is over, William. It just goes to show that opposites attract. To opposites! To me and my academic. Hey Britt. I thought you poured wine? No. Now, William? Sure. Yeah. We have an announcement to make. We are going to be having our third baby. Oh! You're getting a brother and sister! Congratulations. Thanks very much. I appreciate it. Come here. Can I ask you something? Anything. Where does the over protectiveness come from? That is a long story. Does it have to do with your Dad? Unfortunately, it does. And I'm still pretty bitter about it. You probably will be until you confront it, right? You have to deal someday. Yeah. Just not today. Your turn. I can tell you dread family get-togethers. Why is that? Okay. Well I told you that Fran and Frederick raised me from a young age... after I lost my parents. There was a car accident. My parents were driving my best friend Hannah, Fran's daughter, to a recital. And I was supposed to go, but I got was sick. And a truck hit the car. Oh, I'm so sorry Daphne. I wouldn't want to get behind the wheel of a car either. Yeah. I don't know, I just... I could never get over the guilt. Instead of their daughter, every holiday, every get together, it was me, some stranger in her place. So I'd find a corner and hide. And read. Books let me escape. Pride and Prejudice was Hannah's favorite. Thank you. I had a really nice time. Wonderful people.

Just like that? I was hoping that you'd get over this before I finally checked out. Get over what, Fran? Sabotaging yourself. You have real love, Daphne. Not on a page, in a book. In the real world. Wake up. You have no idea what you're talking about Fran. You don't. This trip has one purpose, okay. And one purpose only. You want to scatter Frederick's ashes on the West Coast where he proposed to you. I want to help you get there. It's the least I can do because... Because? Because what? - It doesn't matter. - It does matter. I said it doesn't matter Fran! We don't have a lot of time to be careful. You were going to say 'because you owe me.' Weren't you? How could I not owe you! My baby girl. What happened to Hannah all those years ago was not your fault. You were stuck with me Fran. What else could you do? You were stuck. All those family get-togethers, year after year. I was sitting in your daughter's place. You're wrong. You're wrong. No, I'm not. I wasn't her. I wasn't Hannah. I was just me. Stupid, useless me, who got sick that day. I should have been in the car with my best friend. And my parents. And you know this Fran. No, no. I never felt that way. Frederick never felt that way. We love you! I was no substitute! I was a burden. I was a burden. You were not a burden. - Yes! - Don't say that. Don't! Frederick and I were blessed to have you. You, our little girl, your presence and love. We were happy that you were with us during a time when our family needed it the most. You helped us heal our pain. The only thing we couldn't figure out, Daphne, was how to help you heal yours. But now, now, you finally have real love in your life and you just want to toss it all away. It was fake! It was fake Fran. I was afraid of a relationship with Matt. I did it so I could convince you to stay here and not get on the road. It surprised him as much as it did you. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Matt... I just got into this fight with Fran. I don't know what to do. I don't know who to talk to. No! No! No! Fran! Fran. Please. No, I'm so sorry. Fran stop! Okay that's good to hear. So you'll some of your patrol men keep an eye out for her? Great. Thanks, Paul. I really appreciate it. Uh huh. It's not illegal for her to drive her own motorhome so... Fran is going to get into another accident and kill herself or someone else. There is nothing we can do until the police call. In the meantime, I made the bed up for you. No, no, that's okay. I can take the couch. Or... You can sleep on the bed. Trust me it is way better that the couch. Come on. Come on! Let's go. If you need anything just yell. I'm a pretty light sleeper. Okay. It's going to be fine. They're going to find Fran. Or she'll check her phone and call you back. Stay positive, okay? Tomorrow's a new day. - Good night. - Good night. Thank you. You got it. Matt? Breakfast sandwich for you. Enjoy. Hmm. I appreciate what you did for me last night. And what exactly did I do for you? Sorry. Sorry. I thought you were Matt. Relax. Matt called me and explained everything. Let's go. Where? Go where? Shopping. Matt said all your clothes, makeup, cell phone charger, it's in the motorhome, right? Right. Yes. That's very nice. That's very nice of him, and you. Thank you, but I'll be fine. No offense but I'm sensing 'not fine'. Maybe I haven't mention it to you before but I'm the best shopper in this county. Okay. Okay. Okay, but I'm paying you back. Okay. Let's go. ♪ Time's when ♪ ♪ I'm really feeling down ♪ I know I can turn it around ♪ And I go through with a smile ♪ ♪ Woo oh ♪ I'm happy ♪ Yeah, even though sometimes I get mad ♪ ♪ But I can't go through life being sad ♪ ♪ No no because the good outweighs the bad ♪ ♪ Yeah yeah Woo woo woo ♪ ♪ You don't need someone to tell you ♪ ♪ You don't need someone to help you ♪ ♪ You don't need to be afraid ♪ You got it You got it ♪ ♪ Oh you got it You got it ♪ ♪ You don't need no one to say ♪ You don't need no one to pay ♪ You don't need to walk away ♪ Cause you got it You got it ♪ ♪ You got it! I haven't had this much fun in... Ever! Yeah ever. It checks all the boxes. - New clothes. - Check. - Hair done. - Check. Lunch. Check! Last night I was alone. Now I'm with a friend, enjoying mint tea, and gazpacho, and the most amazing club sandwich I've ever had in my life. My head is spinning. I'm glad you like the food. This is Matt's favorite place. He's all about the chopped salad. Heavy on the avocado. Well, he has good taste. He told me your Mother passed away recently. We're still trying to figure out life without her. She was our heart. I only just worked up the nerve to go through all her things. So what are you going to do about Fran? Well, I'm hoping she reconsiders and comes back. Should Fran even be driving? Not really. No. She has a terminal illness and she acts like... Oh, it's just another thing. I should be angry at her. I just love her so much. It's never easy. I know. Hi. Hey. I hope you're heading east. Got some serious weather in the mountains. Probably going to be some bad winds for the next few days. If you are headed west, I'd wait until that passes. That is one fast delivery guy. Great, because I'm starving. This is the best pie in town. I'm telling you. You're absolutely are going to love it. It's been a long time, son. You lost the right to call me that a long time ago. You should leave. Please. Just give me a few minutes. I know it's a bit of a shock, me turning up like this, out of the blue. There's my card. And my number. I just wanted to see you. Talk with my son. I'll be at the restaurant on Waverly Street at eight o'clock. Financial Advisor. Yeah, right. Are you going to meet him? Huh? No. No way. But he's your Dad? Right? Come on. I haven't had one of those since I was ten. For a long time, my Mom put up with Cal chasing his dreams, blowing away their money. Until one day, she'd finally got fed up and left. Took us with her. And rightfully so. I mean, Cal is a selfish man. Always just thinking about himself. Twenty years and not so much as a phone call. Or a birthday card. Zero interest in us whatsoever. Good riddance. I'd give anything to see my Dad one more day. That pain doesn't go away. Trust me. I know better than anyone. You never know when it'll be too late. Look, um... If you say you'll go with me, I'll think about seeing him. Deal. After pizza. Great. Great. Matt. You came. It's Matthew. One drink. No dinner. Of course. Who's your lovely friend? Hi. I'm Daphne. - Cal. - Nice to meet you. Have a seat, have a seat. - Light beer for me. - Chardonnay. Ah. Jack straight. Thanks. I don't see a ring so it must be a dating thing. No, it's more of a none of your business kind of thing. I've been on the road my whole life. Sold everything from frying pans to insurance. I learned to read people quickly. I wonder if you can read 'angry'? Yeah. And you deserve to be. I was a terrible father. Matt, I've changed. You changed? So, twenty years and that's the best you got? These are on me. At least we can agree on something. I won a little money. Enough to get me up here to see you and your sister. You know I love my kids. Let's go, Daphne. Cal, you can't blame Matt for not believing you. I'm not as bad as you think I am. Your Mother asked me not to follow you all after she left. So, I didn't. I respected her wishes. And when I tried to make contact with her, all I got was a letter from her lawyer saying she wanted full parental rights. I gave her everything she wanted. She deserved better. I don't expect you to forget but I had hoped you might forgive. You abandoned us. No doctor, no midwife. It was the middle of nowhere. You couldn't even pay the phone bill so she could call out for help. So I'm sorry. The only person who could forgive you is her. And guess what? She's gone. She forgave me. You didn't even show up to the funeral. Is that what you think? That I never cared? I visited her in the hospital five times. I begged her forgiveness. She gave it to me. God bless her. Look. I know this conversation was never going to be easy. But I respected your Mother's wishes while she was alive. I wanted to give you some healing time before I showed up. Maybe you should have waited a little longer. She deserved better. She was my soul mate. She left me with some beautiful memories. She must've left you with some of her important things too, right? Are you serious? That's what this is all about, isn't it? What do you want, man? You want her wedding ring? Something else you can pawn off for a couple of bucks? No no no no. Just... Thanks for the drink. I'll see you in another twenty years. I'm so sorry. The night my sister Brittany was born was the worst night of my life. Matthew. Matthew. I'm going to need you to get some help. Okay? Something doesn't seem right. Don't worry, mama. I'll get help. Emergency. What is the problem? Hi. My Mom needs help. Cal was at a bar. Drunk. Clueless. Brittany nearly died. Ten days later, when my Mom was released from the hospital, she left him. She told me that it was over and we were never going to speak about him again. She couldn't bear it. Hey. Hey. I brought breakfast. I'm glad you were here last night. Thank you. Oh, ah... Hey, Paul. Anything? Where? Sure, we'll head that way. Thanks. Okay, look. They found Fran about sixty miles west of here. She's okay. Just a little disoriented. They took her back to Meadowbrook Hospital. So, let's go. Fran? Fran. I should be so angry at you for deserting me. Deserting you? No. I was protecting you. From making a mistake. You mean me and Matt? Okay, well. We've become friends but that's all Fran. Now you and I have to finish what we set out to do. But I already have. All I ever wanted was for you to feel loved. By me, by someone special. Now maybe that's Matt and maybe it's not but there is nothing fake about the way he looks at you and you look at him. Make it work. I'm not sure that I can Fran. I am sure. Because you are loved. And you have brought me more love in my life than I could ever have imagined. And I am blessed to have you. Matt is too. Make it work. Oh. I'm tired. Hey. How is she? She's tired. She's sleeping. So what are you going to do? Fly back East with her. It's our only choice. Yeah, of course. You have been a really great fake boyfriend. I like you too, fake girlfriend. What are you doing with those? Son... I'll make you wish you never had a son. Put them back right now. I was a terrible Father. You weren't around long enough to actually be a Father. So what? It wasn't good enough for you to almost kill Brittany the night she was born. You want to take our only memories of Mom too? I was a fool. I was on the road months, months at a time. I made money, I spend money. Drinking. Women. Forcing your Mother to shoulder the responsibility. You might not believe me but I really did love her. When she took you kids and left, it broke me. I don't care. I don't care about any of that because you left us. You had a thousand chances to make good on it and you never took one of them. The best decision I ever made was to marry your Mother and have you kids. Mom needed you that night. Mom needed you that night and you weren't there. I was. I lost my entire family that night. And I deserved it. You didn't even try to contact us. No phone call. Nothing. What did you do instead? You abandoned us! I was only looking for the letters. She said that you would find them in your own time. But from what you said at the bar, I knew you didn't. You don't know. Whoa whoa whoa. What don't I know? You tell me. Do you still have her special box? You can't have it. That's hers. Just take a look. I haven't been able to bring myself to open it yet. I thought about you. And your sister and your Mother. Every birthday, every holiday. But she made me promise never to contact you so I never sent them. I brought them to her at the hospital, so we could catch up on all those years in some sort of way. You wrote those? I love you Matt. And I wanted you and your sister to know that. To know how much I missed you all these years. Please, just read them. Just read them. I'll be on my way. Marshall. Come. Marshall, this is your Grandpa Cal. He's my Dad. And he's your Uncle Matt's Dad. Hi. Is your last name is Greene too? I sure am. Come on. Hey! Whoa! Let me grab Emma. Go to daddy. Let's go play. She's getting big. Greene Family Night With Cal. Who could have imagined it? Who would have thought he'd actually try to see us? Not me for sure. I guess if you wait long enough, love comes around. We only know him from sneaking into Mom's photo albums. I miss her Britt. Me too. You must be a really good driving instructor, Matt. Ah. Give me a sec. What? You drove that tank here all by yourself? It's Greene Family Night. I passed! Well look at you. Driving a motorhome with confidence. I'm so proud of myself! I'm so proud of myself I am too. Daffy! Oh! Marshmallow! Give me a hug. Come on. Hurry! Go! Go! Go! Let's go! Oh. Marshmallow, you're beating everyone! That's your son. Uh huh. Hey. I know you're worried about Brittany. I always have been, always will be. Yup. And we appreciate that. We do. But, it's time to open yourself up to love. I'm thankful everyday for each moment that I get to spend with Brittany and the kids. I can't imagine my life without them. It's time for you to start living your life, Matthew. Well, thanks for saying that Will. You're welcome. Come on Uncle Matt! I'm being summoned. I'm coming. I'm coming. Who's winning so far? Me. Oh, well. Sounds about right. I think of Hannah every time I make lemonade. We sold it every summer and kept playing with the recipe until it was perfect. It's not like any lemonade I've ever had. It's the secret ingredient. She used to say that the ultimate test for my hero was to see if he could identify what it actually was. Hannah was a romantic. Yup. It was crazy of me to start a fake relationship. I'm sorry. It didn't feel fake to me. I just wanted to reassure Fran. How can we be sure it's anything but fake? This was different. How? I wish I knew. But it was. It definitely was. Fran doesn't have that much time left. Right. Yeah. She has to see the rest of her family. Goodbye, fake boyfriend. Goodbye, Daphne. Daphne. Come give me a hug. I could use one. You just had to go all Jane Austen on me, huh? I love the way she paints the relationship between the heroine and the parental figure. Mr Bennet is my favorite. Yeah. That is pretty cool. Yeah. Oh! My favorite mechanic... That is always around if our cars need fixing. I'm always up for that. I just came by to return this. Ohhh. How did you like it? The way she deals with the class structures. Between the three of us... I actually loved it. Ever the romantic. But you have to be careful. I am no longer single. So you are going to have to back off mister. You know what? I even read the study notes at the back. And...? Oh, something about people not hiding their feelings and sharing them. Don't you know it. Often leading to misunderstandings and near heartbreak. Well, you can't stand by and let that be. No. You can't. I'll see you. - You bet. - Good luck, Mr Darcy! ♪ ♪ What are you doing here? Is it true that no one's been able to guess the secret ingredient in your lemonade? You didn't drive thousands of miles just to ask me that? Not exactly. Long distance never works. We've been through this. You're right. We have to let whatever this is go. It's time we both move on. Here goes nothing Matt. "In vain I have struggled." It will not do. My feelings cannot be repressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire you. "And love you." I love you, too. It's white pepper, by the way. In your lemonade. The secret ingredient. Not so secret anymore. Hannah was right.
