I know it's old, but still, he just had to break it. I turn my back and he's at it. I can't be the one to re-educate him. He's hanging onto this until it breaks. This is the second time. I brought it here to be safe. When I see his class in my schedule, I don't feel like coming to work. Lovro, the new counsellor is here. Come on! Apologize, let's hear it. -Why should I apologize? Why did you destroy it? Are you bored? -Yeah, I'm bored during gym class. And you don't think I'm bored dealing with your shenanigans? Tell me who's gonna pay for this. Want me to pay for it? Will your mom pay for it? -Do I need to pay if I apologize? What happened, Lovro? Look at me for a second, please. Imagine if you hurt yourself, if you fell. Those splinters could've pierced your fingers. Teacher got really scared. Me as well. That's the whole point. Apologize, c'mon! She didn't say anything? "I'm gonna take your laptop and good riddance!" Those words exactly? -Yes. But she's the older sister. Why does that matter? -It does. You got dibs if you're older. Maybe she was bragging in front of her friends. Gregor, what do you think? -Nothing. Nothing? You weren't even listening. But, what Mila said... When you put yourself in someone else's shoes, you realize they've got things on their mind too. Right? So what should've Lovro said to his neighbour? Let me hear it. -You could've explained your mom was asleep. My neighbor's crazy! She knows my mom works nights and sleeps during the day. Why are you so arrogant? -I'm not. You're just stupid. Lovro, this is what we're talking about. We're here because you're angry. Do you understand? Let's have a cookie break and we'll continue. Lovro, how do you feel about this? -It's OK. Very well. Verica! I'm sorry, I thought the classroom was empty. It's empty for a reason. We have to prepare this. OK, but... I have to reorganize these desks, it's all on me. Ok, now I know! DAYS OF BREAD Verica? I've been thinking about the school play... We could have just one theme. And different groups could work together. They could merge. Drama club, the choir... The art club. Go on, I'm listening. What do you think? You're allowed to suggest it. -It can be anything. Marine life, school stories... Something they can relate to. -I'm writing it down. MAILBOX OF TRUST WHY DID YOU PUT COFFEE IN OUR PUDDING? I remember it from folklore classes. So cute... -I loved it! My dear-dear sweetheart... -"My dear sweet-sweetheart". Isn't it "dear-dear"? -No. You've found our spot. -Why are you hiding? How do you pronounce your name? Separately as "Ana Marija" or... One word: Anamarija. Ivana says you've been doing substitute work until now. And here you're full time? I'm so happy for you! Look what I've found. -What? Hormones. -Thank you, colleague! I accept. Look at this, look at yourself. You look exactly the same! Slim, and that cute face! -It's the two of you! I think I've changed a lot. -What are you saying? How old were you? -16, I think. So you were a goth girl? -Yeah, bullied non stop. And look at her now, all romantic! Full of colors. Put it away. I don't like looking at myself. So what? -Put it away! Girls, I'm so hungry my stomach's gonna cry. I'll drop dead if I don't eat something. That coffee was part of the mix. It's just pudding powder. It's not up to me, to add sugar or salt as I please. Don't you worry. -You can tell everything to madam principal. You are allowed to tell her, tell her the kids complained. There's no need for that. There's Vedrana now. I can hear her coming. Hey! Don't you go telling all that to Vedrana. Ana Marija, please! They've posted some videos from class on the Internet again. Danijel, I think that's plain wrong. I beg you to solve it. Fine! Then make her find a kid who will snitch! I didn't film it. I don't even have a smartphone. Only this old junk. Doesn't even have a camera. If you don't want to tell me now, you can write it to me. You know about our Mailbox of Trust? -What did I do? I'm asking you to help me. I can see that was you. There's nothing you can see. Teacher! But I can count the seats, I know where you sit! Anyone can figure that out. You and everyone from the video will be reprimanded. There's no point for the entire class to be reprimanded. That's why I'm asking you. Teacher! -Don't "teacher" me! You'll see how it'll go. I'll delete everything. Of course you will. I told you what would happen. Vedrana, I told them not to do it. -Danijel, I think you're great. But you're the head of the informatics class. Kids can't act as administrators. You either run it or you don't. But... They know it's not allowed to film in class. Sweetheart! What did I just say? -Let Ana Marija finish. If we reprimand them and keep repeating that filming is forbidden... There's no point. What should we do, call the police on them? Just try and be clever about it, Ana Marija. Vedrana, I've been thinking... I can organize it. Maybe we should ask a policeman to hold a lecture. A policeman? Yes, it was your idea. I don't think that's crazy. He could explain why they can't make videos in class. They'll get a different vibe from him. Know what I mean? -Did I complain? Excellent. Just imagine parents complaining, saying they've seen you in a video. Perfect! -Vedrana, I just wanted to ask you... Just look at him! Chasing after her arse, as if she was coated in honey. Leave her alone already, man, for Christ's sake. Enough! I'll be back in five minutes. -Vedrana, please... Coming back! It's for my migraine, you see. When I feel it coming up fast, I drink a whole bottle of water, and then I... I vomit. I'm not so sure about that. -You don't think it's a good idea? I don't know anything. I was just saying, they still play cocking the stickers. You know, cocking, like so. Where was that video from? From your classroom, Sini?a. Nobody filmed at my class. They cocked them at Sini?a's, right? -Yes, they did. I had to review it, that's how I know. All of the videos. Mine are the worst. I mean, I think your suggestion is great. Bring that policeman over. Let them see. THE STAFFROOM Ana Marija organised it superbly. I fully support her idea. A policeman should come, and hold an official lecture to raise interest in them. Regarding taking photos, those GPR issues... That terminology is too advanced for me. They won't listen to me or to you. Look how fat she got. Ugly to see a fat woman. These are some groups that I've started. If you have a suggestion, just write your name on it, Jambrovi?. Vedrana approved it all. -Oh, really? Sini?a, we never got a chance to talk about those videos. If you have 5 minutes to spare... -I have to see the counsellor! If there has been any unpleasantries, we can talk about it. What do you want? Who did you talk to? You're talking rubbish! Excuse me. I didn't mean to single you out. I talked to everyone. It's not a secret. -Talked? Talked about what? Mind your own business. Move it. I don't believe it. Does he look like a policeman to you? -He looks like a stripper. Must be a gift for her 50th birthday... This is our counsellor, Ana Marija. Anamarija. We've talked this morning. "They've talked!" They can't wait to meet you! Ozana, don't take every word so seriously. You think I'm organizing this play just to indulge myself? I have a sick husband and two grandchildren at home. It should be taken into consideration when organizing the time-table. Relax. Easy now. I have a grandchild as well... Blessed are the poor in spirit... Take a leave and deal with your problems at home. Enough! If none of it is no longer included in the working hours, nor the choir, nor the drama club, then everyone's in the same boat. And who doesn't feel like working... That's not what I said! So? Ozana, I need to give some attention to others. Just a moment. You know what I was thinking? It would be better to have the reception first, before the play. So the food doesn't spoil in the heat. Yeah. Caterings sometimes put all the leftovers together... Who knows what's in it. -What do you mean? What did you want to say? It wouldn't be the first time they try to serve old food. It happened before. That's what you say. And I'm telling you that's not the case in this school. Because we fought for that. So don't go saying things that aren't true. Danijel, you wanted to say something. Me? No, I didn't. So? -Should I tell Veronika? Go ahead. It's not a conspiracy, those are just conclusions of the Parents' Council. But it's a done deal now! What's so bad about the groups merging? Merging? -Yes. Verica can explain it. I don't want the groups to merge. -It's only voluntarily. A suggestion. Voluntarily? Are you out of your mind? You won't pull me into it, I don't wanna do this. Hold on. Who brought these baked rolls? I'm getting a bit hungry. We have some bananas. What's her problem with me? She could've told me not to suggest anything. No, he's the real problem. He's the first one to complain. He's arrogant. You can't talk to him. He's so pissed all the time. Coming through, ladies! Thank you. I'm leaving. Those two... You don't know which one's smarter! I told her how I wanted to attend that Dalai Lama course... She asked me if he was still alive! And she's teaching our children, my God... And I'm stopping it, right? I'm against it? -I did not say that... There she is. You stepped on a mine there. You can't keep blackmailing me... There she goes... -Ozana, Ozana! If the groups merge, my literary club can't write 15 characters for your drama club students. I understand everything, you think I'm annoying! I really don't. I didn't say that... Listen, I'll tell Vedrana there's no need for merging. I'm sorry, I've made a mistake. I'm really sorry. Give them an existing piece and that's it. I know how this will work. The kids will write it, then Mrs. Ozana won't like it. And in the end I'll be the one writing it! Oh my! He's so cute! Is that your son? Yes. -Look! He's precious! He said, "Granny, you're the best granny in the world!" That's so true! Seems to me Ozana likes them younger. -That's modern. Dating younger men is now in fashion. Madam principal! -Oh, come on! Let's go. Who keeps opening this, son of a... Windows, radiators... Crazy hags! What was that? Kids throwing rocks. -That wasn't a rock. Was that a ball? -It wasn't a rock. Sr?an, what is it? -A sparrow. A sparrow. -Sparrow? I'm allergic to feathers. It's dead. Do the CPR! Mouth to beak. No, don't put it there! The kids will find it there. Oh, give it a funeral, why don't you?! Lovro! Lovro, stop! Wait! Just a doodle. -You're great at drawing. But everybody tells you that, am I right? Most people. Which classes did you have today? Geography, history, maths and gym class. Where's your history notebook? -I don't need it. Mr. Jambrovi? teaches you using only the textbook? We don't need that either. He gives us these printouts and we study only from those. These ones? -Yes. He doesn't allow the textbook. So you don't have a notebook or a textbook. -No, I don't. Only that. We have to study from that and that's all he's grading us on. I'd bring it with me, I swear. I have everything else. I heard they'll move your office next to the library. Sorry? Don't mind me telling you. I heard the accountant will get your office. OK then. -It'll be better for you there. Great! Student's name: Lovro Mihalec Parents: Ru?ica and Slavko Mihalec Class commitment, Oral exams, Written exams History Don't do it! You know that a guy from my class got reprimanded for breaking the door knob. He broke it and... Stop filming! A guilty man always shows himself! You wouldn't believe the things they did to my brother and me! ...the things they did to my brother and me! Such nasty things, it would sicken you! Listen to me, this is important! They won't stop until they make your life a living hell. The guy comes to me in the street and threatens me to keep my mouth shut. That's how it is. They've been following me my entire life. Leave her alone, I'm talking to her! When that waste container caught fire under my window... They said it was an accident. But I knew who did it! It's an attempted murder! It's murder right there! "What happened? He suffocated." An attempted murder! I don't think Sini?a's exactly crazy. I wouldn't say I'm worried about it. I didn't say he was, like, mentally ill... He's an intelligent man. He can be very funny, you saw it. He just tells it how it is. But this didn't seem normal to me. And Vedrana? Does she know about this? Should I tell her about this? Don't. She knows... She can handle him just fine. Don't you worry about her. I don't know what would need to happen for you to go telling her that. He just knows when someone's inferior to him. Did you see how he snapped at you? It's 'cause your so timid with him. Vedrana knows how to talk to him. And he really respects her. Natalija, let me pay for it. I invited you. -You're my girl. Did you put up the Mailbox? -Yes, just like you did. If he's leaving blank spaces, like you say, it means he just logged in the class, but didn't do anything. You can always notice those who don't do any work. He's talking nonsense during class. He tells an 11-year-old girl he's being followed. Who's following him? The Secret Service? He gives the same grade four times. Without any explanation. I could sit down and resolve this with anyone without any problems. But he simply sees through me, as if he's disgusted with me. You should attend one of his lectures. I'd do that. Choose a mischievous class, and say you'd like to sit in on their lectures. You'll stay with them the entire day, but actually, you'll be observing this particular professor. Then you'll know if he's doing any work or not. But it will all be by the book, protecting yourself. Keep an observation diary and you'll have everything in black and white. If you're still worried about him. You did well by not staying at us. I couldn't do any more substitute work. It drained me. I'm fine with this school now. -One has to fulfill himself. You gotta find your place under the sun. You can't let life throw you around. What God gives you. Now you have your peace. Wonderful! Out of all the classes in this school, she had to choose mine. Sanda, listen to me. Why didn't you choose Katarina's class? That kid Lovro Mihalec is in her class. He's the worst, by far. He never stops making problems. I heard you! Why not her class, why starting with mine? What makes you think they're the worst? Where did you get that idea? -I understand. But it's better not to single out a child. He'd believe he's the worst, and I can't label him as such in the 7th grade. You know? OK. I'm not saying my kids don't misbehave... But they're far from worst. -Yeah, I don't know... It all started with Zora. She was their classroom teacher. Whoever gets them next is screwed. But OK... You do your job, I'll do mine. That's it. -But... Everything's fine. I'd prefer if this sort of things were announced ahead. I did, really, this morning. It's because we're the worst class, teacher. Shut up, douchebag! So, you're angry the lady came to observe you. I'm furious! Crazy furious! Would the missus like to come to the front? -No, thank you. I'm fine here. I had no idea counsellors and the police joined forces. A new tactics, eh? It's dangerous... It's no game when the police comes knocking. Continue with the lecture, please. Pretend I'm not here. We're already used to each other, right? -Yes. Would you look at her... I know your father works at the police. I sniffed it out. I understand everything. What are we going to do now, huh? We'll make a fool out of me? Supervise and control me? Keep an eye on me? What are we gonna do now?! Silence! Rules are about to change. I've been fair and correct with you and you're taking me to the gallows. Well, you're not fair. You're not fair. Who filmed it? You think I was born yesterday. I've seen my fair share of traitors like you. I know what's going on! I was smaller than you when they filmed me! I was a little boy when they tapped me. And they sure did it! Sini?a... I apologize to you. I came to see how the lecture was going. Don't be mad at them, it's not their fault. What's this show for then? They now understand they shouldn't be filming, right? We've discussed it together and everyone's calm. I don't care! Sit down! I was talking to them! From now on, you'll reap how you sow. Whatever happens, it's your fault. Understand that. Is that right? That's right! You keep sitting there, you snotty miss. I have work to do. A lot more important work. Is Vedrana here? -Not today. He was telling me about my dad. He's a lunatic! I get it now. He'll take it out on them, that's what I'm concerned about. He's insulted... -Hi. He's insulted as if the kids and I plotted against him. It's just a phase he goes through. He's not doing anything, giving them answers. We held a meeting about him two years ago. He gets over it. Vedrana knows how to handle him. He's like... -What? His daughter won't even speak with him. -OK, but you can't be like that in class. In any case. -The eight graders love him. It doesn't matter. -I don't know. He actually wrote a textbook, you know? -I don't give a fuck. That's why he's giving printouts. He's not making it up. I'm just saying. You do as you like. This kindergarten's really close to the school. You got lucky. It's God given. I barely got him in! It's crazy, everybody wants this neighbourhood. You can't even imagine. I had to pull a proper miracle. Look at this! Who's lost in his thoughts? Poor thing, waiting all alone for her. Where are all of your friends? Did you leave them? No. -No. They won't stop until they make your life a living hell. The guy comes to me in the street... Hello. Excuse me... -I'm here! He gave him an F. My kid got home and started crying. I hear you. -Literally crying! 'Cause the teacher told him he couldn't correct it. So I came to check the grade book, and there are three F grades now! Same grade copied three times! For what? For what? You are my witness, did I make any fuss about the reprimands? 'Cause my son is a perfect student! They've been following me my entire life. Hey, I'm talking to her! When that waste container caught fire under my window... They said it was an accident. But I knew who did that! An attempted murder. That's murder right there! They... Stop it. They lit a container... I told her. As a homeroom teacher, I can't... I'm not an expert. I can't change the man's grade. Of course, but he's taking it out on them. That's the thing. He's provoked. -Provoked? What are you suggesting? That I should call for a staff meeting? It turns out you're having a secret project. -It's not secret. I was observing his lecture. -Excuse me. If I may... History being taught like that, I find it horrible. If it was another subject, that's fine, but history... Unacceptable. Ok, Vlado! -Am I right? Vedrana, listen to me. He attacked the children in front of me. There was no lecture, do you understand? Ana Marija. I would prefer if you consulted with me. That would be the right thing to do. I'll talk to Mr. Jambrovi?, but I don't want to make a fuss about an F. I'm not talking about that. -I understand everything. You think it doesn't matter to me. It matters, but you don't have all the facts. The damage is done now. It looks as if I'm not doing a thing, but you were acting behind my back. I wasn't. -I did not expect this attack from you. But the damage is done. -Vedrana... We had a staff meeting, maybe you didn't know. But now it's clear. I gave you a chance when you needed it. Verica's nephew was also looking for a job as a counsellor. But I trusted Mrs. Ljiljana when she phoned me. And when she asked me to hire you. I've put my neck on the line. You see how embarrassing this is for me. I showed you some understanding. I'd expect the same from you. I feel stupid for even saying this. -Excuse me. Vlado, are you planning to sleep here tonight? Veronika, the window. What happened? Mirjana, bring that chair. Vedrana told us to help you move today. Now? I can't do all this today. -We were told just now, as well. One at a time! Be careful. Let's go. This room is bigger. Who's gonna find me here? What about me? SCHOOL VOLUNTEERS Wait, it was your birthday! -You scared me. Happy birthday! -Thanks. Did you bring any food? -Neda! You're a Sagittarius? -Unfortunately. Let me congratulate her. All the best! Happy birthday. We didn't know. -Thank you. Happy birthday. -Thanks. The two of us. -The two of us? It's her birthday. Can she join us today? -Yes. What's today's topic? -Gossip. Next week, human rights. Who's gonna hand these out? Mila. Why did they move your office? -This one's bigger. Come in. Defendant Sini?a Jambrovi?'s appeal is dismissed as unfounded. Ivana! Sini?a, do you have a minute? Let me give this back to you. Is that OK? We can sit here. Sini?a, I'd like to give this back to you. That's yours. Hold on to it. I can see it's something important. The Mailbox is for kids. They need the anonymity. Fine. If it's for the kids... You can always come talk to me in person. I wanted to make it easier for you. I see you're investigating me. You should know what some people are going through. This is your dispute with the textbook publisher, right? You wrote a textbook, right? -Wrote it? Those are such nasty games, I can't even tell you... At first, they were very nice. I get that. I'm used to it. They give you a deadline, which they cut to a year. And then they cut it again. So you applied for the publisher's tender? You didn't do any maneuvering? It was official? -I came to them. I made everything myself. I could do their jobs. All the minute details I had put into it! There was a tender. They thought I didn't know. Nothing's real about it. They had their own player all along. Of course, I understand. Look, you're young. You have no idea what this is all about. That's why I'm telling you all this. -True. I've been thinking. These are some dreadful things, right? You feel like all your effort is slipping through your fingers? For example, my father... -Oh, come on. People think, "A cop." No! He had the same problem as you did. He was offered a position in the union and he wanted to do it. But he didn't want to risk his health. He knew he'd have gotten ill. He knew exactly how it would've ended. Is that it? That's what I'm talkin' about! You can tell where this story begins, and how it will end. I can tell you all about it! My brother died from cancer because of people like that! They all laugh at me, thinking I'm ignorant. I read everything: the media, newspapers, web portals... I know everything! My father-in-law and his little daughter laughed at me. I told them: "Get out of my sight, morons!" I'm well-read and some people can't handle that. Yes. It's just that... Children can't comprehend that. They can't. It's not for them. Those are difficult subjects. It's better to cut them some slack, right? Alright... This is not something to discuss during class. Fine. Why don't we make a deal not to talk to them about it? So they can focus on the lecture. OK, we won't discuss it. What's the problem? Do we have a deal? -Deal! The two of us can talk any time. I started reading it, and the most important parts were highlighted. Imagine that. He finds me interesting now. He needs an audience. I didn't do it to really make friends. I wanted to tell him: "Sini?a...!" Ozana, listen to what I'm saying. Crazy hag. As soon as the new minister comes, you can throw that ordinance goodbye. It'll be in your working hours again. The Lord giveth, the Lord taketh away. Here's your pet. Why don't you talk to her? Ozana... Please, don't say that. Understand? Would you listen to her! It was a joke. Don't even joke about it. What's the "pet" for? -That'll say on my tombstone. Have some. Ri?i?ki! -Yes? What did you assign them to do? I will not perform the things they wrote in front of parents. I knew it. -Ozana... It's inappropriate! He wants the kids to take drugs on stage. Not drugs, it's glue. They saw a man with his head in a bag at the park. It's a problem they want to talk about, they're interested in that now. I'm not interested in it. But the kids wrote this. They expect to perform this. We can fix it together... -Together? But we can keep the same theme... -No chance. Will you come down? -No, you two have done plenty. Only thing missing is for you to start writing, too. We can have two plays. 'Cause I have time for everything. I'll do fables. That's got nothing to do with the theme of the play. Or some folk tales. They had book reports on them. Fables! Why speak when kids could bleat? What's this... Don't lose your temper. Do you need anything? Vedrana's not here and I need her, so I thought... I have a session in court. They're acting dumb. No one will show up again. I know them well. It's like the Inquisition. If I was weaker, I'd have been burned at the stake a long time ago. I must be... I'm like Galileo, for fuck's sake! They want me to deny everything. Now I have to, in front of you as my pupil, say the real truth. Right? -Exactly. People think Galileo was burnt at the stake. Hell no! The man said "Eppur si muove" behind their backs! The guy went on with his work and life. He saved himself. Fuck, he wasn't crazy to sacrifice himself for a bunch of idiots! Come with me, I'll give you a few apples. -That's fine. Don't get so riled up. It's better if you ate some apples instead of hitting that machine. I can sense you're nervous. It happens when you can't hold back. -Oh, no! You've got that streak in you. It shows immediately. I'm also good at reading people. Just like you, I'm a psychologist of sorts. You're way too sensitive. I'm telling you for your own good. You're sickly. You gotta filter things out! Sini?a, please, don't. Sometimes it's good to hear what others think of you. It's not just me saying that. You gotta be less nervous. It's not good for your head, for your body, for anything! Is that right? You are a young mother. Right? God willing, you'll have more children. A child picks up on that nervousness. The stress comes from the pregnancy, from the stomach. It's all connected. I mean, it's not like I'm... Would you look at her... I speak from my heart. Otherwise, I wouldn't have said a word. I care about you. I'll wash a few of apples for you. What do you think I'm doing? This isn't about you... -No, it's not. I'm not doing anything for anyone. Do you think I'm doing this on purpose? -God forbid! Do you? -No! If you think so, I'll resign right now. I will resign! It's not about you. -It's not me? Ask the lady... -Should I put an apron and cook with you?! Give it a try. Maybe it'll work out. OK, I'll resign just because of the kitchen. Give me a hat and I'll do it, no problem. Such mouth you have! You could run for government! I won't be provoked by you! Where were you? Did you get lost? Put all of these biscuits on a tray. We'll have them with our coffee. Vedrana, I brought them for you. Thank you, Gloria, but I'm on a strict diet. So? -To sum up... The kid was in a drama club, acting workshop. Maybe she wasn't really up for it, not enough talented... After moving to Ireland, the kid blossomed. He's from City Council? In the West, teachers try to hire professionals. Professional actors who teach those kids in drama clubs. Teachers work with them in their own free time. Somehow, this works in the West. Maybe we could make a suggestion. -You can, of course. Could we? -To the parents' class representative. And he'll propose it at the Parents' Council. That's right. Me and Ana Marija are present at every Parents' Council meeting. Try a biscuit or two. -The lady will do our catering. And for the play as well. Our kitchen staff is somewhat limited. We'll also have a nice little stall at the Christmas Fair. Try one, Ana Marija. I can see they're excellent. It's all natural ingredients, no sugar. My wife bakes them for our friends. -Excellent. I think those could sell well. -Absolutely! Those biscuits are nothing special. I don't know who'd eat those. They're dry and crumble a lot. Definitely not an original recipe. Did you see what she looks like? Floozy. -Floozy? Vedrana is having you do all this bull for the Fair, just to impress her. All we need is a folk band. Or a philharmonic orchestra. -God help you, girls. You're so big, honey. Let me see! Delete them, delete them! Did you sell anything, how's it going? I have a question for you. Ivana said you had a nose job. I don't believe it for a second. I'd have never guessed it. It's true, but don't spread this around. -Over my dead body! Let's go! I can't hold more than this! Get back here! They took our presents. We need them. It took us two days to wrap them. Give that back! I don't believe it. Come on, boys. You're throwing them. Shame on you! He's kicking it in front of me! We were only goofing around. -Goofing around. Stop throwing them! Tell them something. Stop throwing the presents! You're the one to ask... Shameful. Thank you, colleague. -Like she's gonna tell me... See that? Some people are oblivious to the problems of others... Is this your car? -Yes. See this? The only one with a brain here! The woman knows how to protect the windshield from freezing. A woman thinking like a man. Put them under the tree. Freeze! Who are you? -The bully. Who are you? -The separator. Who are you? -The victim. Who are you? -The witness. Who are you? -The witness. Witness? -Yes! Guys, who'll stay and help the first graders tomorrow? I can. -Tonka... I can too. -Mila... I will stay. -All of you? I can't. Lovro? Lovro? The man yelled at me so hard... I'm scared to go outside. Why would I kick a child out during class? He must've hit himself afterwards. I don't know. You're too lenient. You don't know how to handle them. I don't tolerate that. I'll bite, straight away. Not like a caveman, but nicely, with fancy words. That's how it works. Want me to drive you home? Oh no, I called my husband to pick me up. I had a couple like that. They were divorced, but they would come together to every information meeting. Both scared of what the other might say about them behind their back! He'd scream at her, "You bitch!" In front of me! You should hear me sometimes... When I drop Teo at the kindergarten... I tell those women: "I strictly said that Teo should not take a nap!" Like they need me saying that! Wait, I can't open this. -Let me try it. Well done! You lifting weights? Slavonian chutney, guys! You gotta try it. The lady's waiting for you. Mrs. Vlaovic is waiting for you. But you better tell me what the two of you talked about. OK? She told me this was the second year that the Parents' Council... Mrs. Vlaovi?? -Yes. Parents want the City to announce a vacancy for another cook. She wants me to put it on the agenda. The agenda for the Parents' Council meeting has been sent. If she wants to discuss that again, she can wait for the AOB item. Should I call her and tell her that? -No, no, no. Ana Marija, let me tell you something about her. She's always looking something to occupy herself with. It's always the same. She's capable of setting up and lying. It happened more than once. But let me tell you something. I can tell the parents show great affection for you. It really is so. They appreciate you, I can see that. And they will listen to you. I'd like to show you all of the files regarding the request we sent, so you could explain it to them. -Me? Yes. Because they won't listen to me. Now you'll see what I have to deal with. Shall we vote on the new agenda item, the kitchen? No! We won't waste our time on voting. Please, let's open the AOB item where you put it. Of course. I'll take a seat in the back, right here. You take over. Imagine I'm not here. I'll begin. I have all the paperwork sent to the City back in October regarding the new cook position. You're all aware of that. Unfortunately, we have yet to get a reply. I'd like to make copies of these and give them to you... Dear lady, we have the copies right in front of us. I had no idea. In any case, we can't move forward until we receive a reply. We're very sorry, but... Until then, the parents will have to pay for school meals... Are you seeing this? Are you? We're going in circles. It's not our fault. -Then who's fault is it? Anamarija, please! The request for a cook won't pass anyway. You should've put it on the agenda, so everyone could read it in advance. I've elaborated this project in details, how we should take money from EU funds for 10% of meals in question, instead of having to pay for them ourselves! People don't know what we're talking about because you didn't give them any materials. Say it now, ma'am. -How can I say it now?! How can I retell all 30 pages of it, one at a time? We can arrange something. -Let me finish. Why didn't you give them the materials so they know what I'm talking about? Why did we meet today? I'm wasting time I don't have. Mrs. Vlaovi?. Do you want a glass of sugar water? Do you see what kind of emotional blackmail this is? I really don't think you need to deal with this. I don't think it's your job. It's her job. I'm really sorry about this. I didn't want to make a mess. Please... This has been going on for three years now! She'd do anything just to make me look crazy. She doesn't want me in the School Board for the next vote on her new mandate! But of course, the Parents' Council will elect me, 'cause I'm the only one who wants to deal with this! She's afraid... ...of the things I might call her out on. -I see. It's so hot. Are you hot in here? We should drink more water. We always forget to do it. 17, 18, 19, 20... 'Morning! Sorry! I didn't even realize all seats were taken. There's no seat for her. Who's sitting over there? Sorry! -Don't sweat it. Where's your backpack? Where have you left it? Stop. Everybody, stop! Wait here. Is this an owl? -Yes! Can you do a peacock? -No! It sounds like a seal. Hey there, girl! Hey there, girl! Could this work? Sure. Found it! Move along. I'm a bit embarrassed right now. Let's go! Oh my... Hello! I'm so glad to see you. -What's up? Hi, Danko. Field trip? These are my volunteers, the sixth-graders. Good afternoon. -Good afternoon, volunteers. We wanted to eat some cake in peace and quiet. Look at this now... I always remember our sweet snacks after lunch... All that sugar would hit me, I had to sleep in the bus the entire way home from Mlaka. You stole her from me! -Stole her? Yeah, right! She's thrilled to ride the bus to work in Velika Mlaka. This one can take care of herself, don't worry. She even "found" a kindergarten at a walking distance. Caught the golden goose, didn't she? Mestre, Venice, Udine, Trieste... I've been there. In the south: Rome, Ancona, Padova, Naples, Mt. Vesuvius, Ancona, Mt. Etna, Sicily... Everywhere! Southern Macedonia, ?tip, Bitola... I love it. -Let me see. Look! This one's not so good, but there's a better one. You'll take mine by the deer. How can you hang dead animals on your wall? Taxidermy is art. -Surgical precision, I get that. Talking about surgeons... -Let me hear it! His name is Tomislav. -How precise is he? But Vedrana's son is also a surgeon. -Bless him. Vedrana's just putting pressure on you. Someone arranging you the job, etc. -But it's not true! Oh please! I could tell you such stories... She doesn't want to go back to teaching. This tells you everything. I can't avoid her. We're hand-in-glove. OK, she has some good sides too. But those with fancy words are the worst. She's not afraid of us, you know. She'll handle both you and me with ease. She's afraid of the outside pressure. She's afraid of the parents. If they put their feet down, and I don't mean those crazy ones, but normal people, that would be her biggest grudge. Get away from here. Let him sit here, get in the back! Come on, we don't want you here! Shush, sit down. Move to the back! -Stop it. Sit down already! Quiet! Move! -Oh, no! My boob! You're so strong! -You're next! Boobies! There's a leak! -A leak! Call the cleaning lady! Cleanup needed! Who's got a cleaning lady? Dino, you got a cleaning lady? Did you hear this? God forbid doing something by themselves, they might break a sweat. They're not talking about that. You misunderstood them. Really? Misunderstood? Then what is it about? They're just swearing and kidding around. Vlado, I wasn't talking to you. I was talking to them. Spill it out! -It's just their slang, Sini?a. It doesn't matter. -It doesn't? But what matters is that I've misunderstood them. Is that right, Vlado? That's the important part. Spill it out, kid! But... We... we were just... Foo... fooling around. Sini?a. -I wasn't asking you, but him. It's their private joke, you've got it all wrong. Vlado, can he speak for himself? Start talking, Dino! -What did I do? Alright now! We will all calm down now. We should all be quiet! We can't shout at each other behind the driver's back. Is that OK, Sini?a? It's dark, the road is slippery. We should drive carefully. I'm sorry, Dra?ko. Look at this. I got here, I'm looking at this... There's a photo missing. It was lying on the floor. Thrown? -Ripped away and torn apart. He pierced my head with a pin needle. He did it? -Who else? The guy's vindictive. I'm telling you. I don't even find this funny anymore. Vlado, someone wants to talk to you. -I don't care. Look at the time... I'll find them and then we'll resolve this. Just a second. We'll be here. -Thanks a lot. They're over there. Please, go talk to them. My students' parents. Talk to them 'cause I'll go nuts. I feel helpless. Just a moment. I've told the teacher to come, so please start from the beginning. Vlado, I have nothing to talk to you about. What did I do? OK, then I'll start. I'd like to apologize to the teacher for having him caught off guard. This wasn't supposed to be an ambush. We asked for the homeroom teacher and the counsellor to be present. Once again, it's the same thing. Do you understand? Once again, the answers didn't match the test. What's from the textbook and what's not. I don't understand what's so complex about this? Why complicate it this much? -Just look at this... All we ask is that you teach from the textbook. So the kids don't get confused. -No one's attacking you. You've set up this meeting and cornered me! Sini?a, Vlado didn't organize this. -It has nothing to do with me. Sini?a, wait. If the kids are confused... They think they did something wrong. They feel embarrassed to ask. -Oh don't give me that! Please, sit down. -Do we have the right to complain? If they don't, do we have the right? -Take it easy. I'll give you an exact example, OK? -Please do, mister! The book says... I'll read it. Croats were polytheists. The worship of ancient deities and the chief god of thunder, Perun, is found in folk songs, old customs and superstitions. In contact with the natives, they were baptized in the 7th century. From here and here to here. But what's this on your papers? Where did you get that from? Even I couldn't understand it! It's like reading someone's train of thought! Huh? This list of documents you name, it's all unstructured nonsense! I looked it up, it's not being taught anywhere! Well, If you don't want your child to learn... Hold on. This is page 35 out of 220. And it's almost March! Listen here, now! When I hear the respected teacher rattles on to the kids about himself for half an hour, talking about what they'd done to him... They didn't want to hire him, he doesn't have sufficient pensionable service... I feel like coming to the class and going apeshit! For Christ's sake, leave those kids alone! All we ask of you is to teach by the textbook we bought. That's all bull! Here's Mr. Bla?evi?, the President of the Committee... President... Of the Parents' Council. A nice, polite man, so he won't say some things. But I will. We know that you made fun of his son for stuttering! I won't tolerate this. We know you did! So what if he stutters? Let him stutter! What are you talking about? -What? So, the children are lying? What's he talking about? -Hold on... My apologies to you. The teacher said you got our back on this. Wait, Sini?a, please. If we can't sort it out here, let's take it to the principal. I agree. -I didn't want this to be about stuttering. What stuttering? Come on! I'll put this in the papers. -Do whatever you want! You stinking motherfucker! Sini?a. -You fuck... Sini?a, wait. That disgusting stinking motherfucker... Vlado, you should leave. This doesn't really concern you. I can stay. -Don't get smart with me! There's the door. I'd like to say we're not here because of the stuttering. The teacher will come shortly. We'll settle everything. We had to wait for you again, huh? Half an hour. I wasn't making fun. Sini?a, you'll keep quiet now. -OK. However... You can't talk while I'm talking. You're interrupting me. -I'm not. Look at this! -You're not using your head! You're interrupting me in front of parents. -I'm not! You don't let me speak. You can't... I wasn't making fun! Ask her. You can't speak... -It was late and... Wait a minute, now you're the one who's interrupting me! Can I get a word in edgeways?! This is an extremely uncomfortable situation for me. Did you hear? You'll be in the papers. He won't do it... But that's what you wanted, now you have it! Should I beg for forgiveness on your behalf? You need me now, so think carefully about it. Shame on you! You tell me now, what should I do? What should I do?! I think it would be better if we left. No, I wanna hear this. -We'll go outside. Let them talk in peace. C'mon. You just talk in peace. There was no reason. -You got scared shitless! I wasn't scared. -Let him speak. Let him talk. Sr?an, please... I was stupefied. Stupefied. Vedrana put on a show for them. So what, what do you want now? What was she supposed to do? I don't understand what you're asking me. I'm telling you, what a fucking actress. She got all hysterical on purpose. Vedrana wants to see you. A journalist is here, Anamarija. I think it's because of that... Look what they're doing to her! There you go! Where were you? They're sending us journalists. Madam counsellor will also tell you, you have no business here! You may leave immediately. -Jeez, I got it! Sir, please. -Don't you try and take photos! I'll call the police. -We won't. Please don't write anything. We're dealing with a difficult person. You'll just make it harder on us. The man's lying at home, sick. -OK, I get it. I made Sini?a take sick leave. He'll come back after he's calmed down. I know how to deal with him. That dad called this guy. The one from the Customs. He thinks everyone will help him. Go after him. Go! You got a wild one over there. She's lucky that I came. Someone else would fuck her up. I know who she is! Isn't that great, how you know everything. I have my job, you have yours... So long, I won't help you. Are you insane? Who let you in? Was it you? Yes. He said he needed to use the restroom before a meeting. Shame on you! -What are you yelling for? This isn't the high street! -Secretly taking childrens' photos! I wasn't photographing anything. How am I supposed to know that? -I'll show you. Am I an expert on cameras? He didn't take photos, for fuck sake. Who let them in? -Nobody! No one should have any business with them! Mirjana... Vlado? -Hold on... He sped by me and yelled... She's hysterical. -She's not fine, she's lucky as hell. She's clumsy. -She wil pull herself together. Pull herself together? She's crying like a child. You go tell her to turn on her phone! I grabbed the first aid kit... That poor girl, who knows what state she's in? Katarina, listen to me. Calm down and answer. You have to start answering the phone. I'll help you, don't worry. We'll call the Social Service, the psychologists will come... It will all be fine, but you have to answer. Do you hear me? Horrible... -I kept saying Lovro was a trouble maker. Don't get me wrong. We shouldn't put labels on children... Your mom and dad here? -Yeah. There she is. Hello. Throw the gum away. Throw it. Are you scared? -He's not. Are you scared? -Let's go, Katarina. He's crying, look at him. What's going on? What did they tell you? Tell me what's happening! Lovro, look, a flamethrower! Be quiet! They're scared, in a shock. The inspection will go into their home. They're now becoming aware of the entire system they have to go through. That the Social Service will check if he was neglected... But the Center may conclude that everything's fine. That the child regrets it, and that it was a one-time issue. Then it won't get out of hands. You've explained them the situation very well. I mean it. And honestly, that's really rare. Lovro and that girl, Ema... The system will work with them on an individual basis. But their class witnessed it. We should be the first to hold a conference with the parents. Then you do the same. So they get psychological help as well, to learn how to speak with their children about it all. I don't want to come here twice, do you understand that? You're sending a psychologist to ask me how I feel. What's wrong with you? I know how to talk to my daughter. We need to discuss specifics here. That girl got mutilated. Have you seen her face? Why didn't we meet first and then with the psychologists? Who's gonna answer for this? That's what I want to know. Please, sit down. -I want some answers. We've taken all necessary steps. -That's right. Who let him into the school with that kind of spray? He didn't carry it under his shirt! What is it with you? Don't touch me. Half of the girl's face is bandaged. I've heard he's already been sent to the counsellor several times. That's true. I've worked with him, but I can't talk about him. What can you do? We all want to know what's going on with that boy. I understand. But I can't disclose this information in public. Just tell them... Tell them. I can't discuss a child to people other than his parents. I have to protect his privacy, as well. -Tell them, already. I can't reveal the child's diagnoses! I can say that the child's ombudswoman has been informed, as well as the Ministry and the Social Service. That's it? -For now. That's it?! We got here just for that? -For the time being. I'm Lovro's sister. I'll tell you. We had two appointments, we're waiting for the psychiatrist's and the psychologist's evaluation. In two weeks, we have a scheduled appointment at the Children's Hospital. Was that so hard to say? Thank you. Ana Marija! If I instruct you to do something, especially in front of parents, then do so. What was that scene? You're not letting me do my job. If you don't trust me, say it clearly. Then write an official statement about all of this. For our files. To avoid any confusion. -Very well. I'd like to ask you... I'm somewhat embarrassed. Is Mr. Jambrovi? really ill? I wouldn't like to be the cause of his illness. I know madam principal told him to go home, but I don't want to send a man to his grave. Understand? He's on sick leave, of sorts. Get it? -Oh, thank God! I'm not sure if... Whether to run for the School Board. Some people are trying to persuade me... I thought Mrs. Vlaovi? was supposed to be elected. Yes, but... There are some who would like me to run as well. They keep calling... It makes me uneasy. I don't like the arguing. I don't mind attending the meetings, preparing for them... But all those hotheads... Unlike her, I couldn't step on others... And on madam principal, as well. Each person needs to be given a chance. Keep an open mind. We should try to see the best in people. It's easy to criticize and sow discord. -Right. OK. But... I think Mrs. Vlaovi? really wants to do it. You know? She has the strength for it. It's up her alley. Not an easy task. -Yes. That's an important role. You think it would be best if I didn't run? I don't want to dissuade you. I mean... Then the votes won't split between us. She'll definitely be elected. It would be the simplest solution. -Yes. Thank you. Look at him! Looking great. Want some of this? What did we say? -That. Well done, colleague. Congratulations! Every dog has its day. I've heard everything, I know what happened. Our colleague gave herself a lot of work. Gave herself a lot of work, Sini?a? She had to know what to do. Diana, it's fine. Never mind. -Hold on. Our ex-counsellor wouldn't know who to call. I congratulate her. What's the problem? Bravo! Congratulations! Just leave me alone, for cryin' out loud! Why are you acting like this? That's what I'm talking about. Jambo, keep it down! -PMS bothering you, sir? Why are you like this? Look at yourself. I'll give you a round of applause, if that's what you need. What is it? Why are you looking at me?! You had your five minutes in the spotlight. Bravo! Mommy... Did you hear about this soup... It has deer poop in it, little chocolate balls covered with olive poop, olive juice, and on top of that small ant poops. And then on top of it... Education and Teacher Training Agency Subject: Complaint on a teacher's work Have you gone mad? Why did you do that?! He won't know it was me. -Someone will know. You said the old guy's nuts. He could assault you. I don't give fuck. He can eat shit for all I care! I wrote it on a computer. How's he gonna know? Boy, I'd love to give you a proper beating right now! Where did you send it? -To the supervising agency. At least someone should sanction him, if she doesn't want to! She should get scared shitless, that nut case! She sent him home to lie in bed! Why do you always need to take charge? He won't know, for God's sake! People write complaints all the time. It's nothing unusual. And I wrote it very objectively! Yeah, if it's anonymous, there's no harm. Don't scare her. You guys think I don't know anything. There was a lot of these things at my job, too. I'm scared for you. And you're screwed, big time. Where are we going, Mom? Mom doesn't want to talk to those ladies there. Let's go under here. -No! You can fit easily! -I wanna go over there. Teo, we can't go there. -We can. You're the one with the problem. Teo, please! I'll go after you. No, please go under this! Well done, sweetie. See, we got through. No one saw us. It's written too generally, understand? A parent could not have written that. Vedrana told me this in confidence. Parents write about specific situations they know about. Maybe there were more parents involved. There's no way it was a parent. I feel really sorry for him, but his behavior is awful. I care about Vedrana, not him! They can inspect all of us now. Why not, why not? They can tell Vedrana to provide them with whatever they want. Nikola... He punctured my tires. Him! He knows, for sure. I don't know, front ones. Punctured, ripped, I dunno. Kids couldn't have done it. Please, just get here. I don't know. Call a cab. Call a cab and get over here. Good afternoon. Are we leaving? I don't get it. -He's over there. That's him. See? He's sitting over there. The guy who looks like a hunter? -Yes. Come on! -Tell him something. What do you want me to do? What should I say to him? You want me to punch him? Don't look at me like that. If I go there, I'll seem crazy. The man's busy. Look at him, he's not even turning around. 'Cause he's doing his entire year's work now. So what? Why are you getting angry? -I'm not angry. Look where I am. They're looking at us funny. We both look insane. Let's go, please. It wasn't him, come on. Who are those guys? Who? -That one. Pretty boy with fancy sunglasses. -He's my co-worker. You never mention him at home. You think it's funny? Anamarija! You should bring a globe. But without the pedestal. Just the planet that'll hang on your hand. And I'd like it to glow. So, a glowing planet. I don't care how or where you're gonna get it. No problem. -OK, move now! Let's go! A man was riding... -Now! A man was riding a donkey and his son was walking next to him. A man was passing by and said... It's wrong that you're riding instead of your son. Your legs are stronger than his. What's with this? -I have a tic. No, you don't. Continue. The father got off and his son got on. Another man passed by and said... Shame on you for riding and letting your father walk! Your legs are stronger than his! Why are you shouting? So that they hear me. -Next. Then they... Then they both sat on the donkey's back. A third man was passing by and said... What's this nonsense? Two old asses riding a weak animal! Very nice. Continue! -Well done! When all those passers-by... When all those passers-by start laughing... We lie the donkey down, put his legs on our shoulders and walk, walk... The rest of you walk behind them and wonder. We're wondering! Move! We're all wondering... Wondering... We're wondering a lot. A lot, a lot... And finally, the father puts the donkey down and... And says... A man gets crazy trying to please others! I'll do with my donkey as I wish, just as before. Others can say what they want! Exactly. In the afternoon, the roundabout gets crazy. We've come to an agreement. The supervisor will talk to each one of us separately. That's right. Where to? -Downstairs. Yes, you filled everything correctly. The teacher's initiative, the use of teaching aids... You did a thorough job. It's how I always do that, the same protocol. There's a big difference between what's written here and what I saw in today's lecture. -Yes, I understand that. It was a different story today. My role is to see how things work on-the-spot, as a witness. Apart from the complaint. The state of affairs is determined here. I will make an assessment based on that. I received information that it was you who filed the complaint. It wasn't me. According to this, it makes sense. -No. The complaint is one thing. These are my notes to everyone, including madam principal, and my multiple conversations with the teacher. Parents were complaining. They were upset. They even threatened to report him. -Right. Actually, my question was just a routine matter. Unfortunately, we are aware of the teacher. I will definitely issue him a reprimand. He'll have time to correct things. You will also have to correct certain things, nothing special. You have to understand... You can't just throw a man out on the street. He doesn't have enough years in his pensionable service. It would be cruel. It's a matter of pension. It's a problem, at his age, to lose a job like that. One's life stops, so to speak. I'll tell you what I think. I've told you that about myself. It's not a counsellor's job, to undermine those who do some actual work around here. Anamarija? Come, please. No, no, not yet. You may go in. Close the door. I'm sorry. Here you go. This is for you. You have time until Thursday, 48 hours. Vedrana, you must be kidding. This has nothing to do with me. I'm not kidding one bit. Just as it says. Write an official statement about the entire matter. In black and white. Because I will not be dragged through the dirt! Vedrana, please... -Vedrana, nothing! Unfortunately, I can't fire you. The woman terrifies me. I told her, "You must be kidding." And she said, "I'm not kidding. You have 48 hours." Or whatever. You know what she's like. But this thing with the photographer... To give an official statement about being present when he was allowed to enter the school. Me? I was there, not letting him inside. She's lying through her teeth. I wouldn't let him in under no circumstances! The cleaning lady let him in, not me! This will all be in your record. That's idiotic, for that to be official... I won't go to the union representative. I won't. OK, everything's clear. -I don't know what they're... What deal they have. -Listen. We'll write a memo saying all further questions are to be sent to your lawyer. We'll put my name and contact info. And done! She's the one slandering you, not the other way around. Nikola, that's not the point. It's an internal memo and it shouldn't go public. These are frame-up schemes... She's getting even with me. A statement on the complaint is one thing. I screwed up by doing that. Listen... Legally, she can't force you to write a statement. The complaint is anonymous. Full stop. You're not in any offense. That's why I say, let's impress her. She'll have me doing this for every little thing now. I'm afraid she found out I spoke to Bla?evi? about the Board. Don't dwell on it for no good reason. What are you crying for? -Leave me alone! You should just calm down. It's done. You wanted to do something, to get things moving. To get something moving. I know what's going through your head. As if anyone ever asked me if I would change something. As if anyone ever asked me anything either! You're not Jesus on a cross. You're now punishing yourself and you're angry... You wish you could whip yourself! -OK, mom, I get it. I can see you're torturing yourself... No one will blame you if you stop. If you don't mess with it anymore. Just don't confront anyone and that's it. Right. Life is a struggle. Listen to Nikola. You left your previous job, now you're here. What'll you do now? It is what it is... You love children. Do it! You'll be coming home, going to bed... Hand in those papers and be done with it. Finished! Lovro's mom just called me, crying. She's rushing here from work. This is his third final F. He'll be held back. Because of geography. She wants to talk to you. -She should talk to Sanda. I don't know. She wants to talk to you first. Could you... He was supposed to call me after the exam. I came straight from work, as soon as I could. He's so embarrassed. Ask the teacher, persuade her, just to retake the exam... Just one retake! Go to my office, please. I have to talk to the teacher first. I'll be right there. -But ask her to do it. Wait for me there. Oh, no. No. We won't play like this. Now you want to put pressure on me, you want to decide who should be lenient? What were you thinking? I was just about to look for you. I wouldn't... Katarina already told me. You want to question my judgement without anyone telling me about it. I don't need a middleman. -I didn't say it like that. That's not true! I was looking for you, listen to me! She wants to talk to you! So she doesn't want an F, but doesn't care about his absence. He barely knew anything! He answered only two questions. And you're not going to be the one... -You know what? Stop explaining. It's your subject, I'm not an expert. She needs you! It's your call. Listen to me... -He really studied. I don't know what comes over him. I tell him, "Son, you gotta get some sleep." He doesn't sleep all night. I tell him, "You have to sleep." He says, "I get everything mixed up, Mom." I tell him, "Son, it's because you're scared." But when should she quiz him?! That was his final grade, what am I gonna tell her? I came to you 'cause you're smarter than me. You understand what's wrong with him. You could tell her about it, whatever it's called! I'm the last one she'll listen to! I can't even talk to her! Sit down. Listen now. Go to the staffroom. Apologize to the teacher immediately. Immediately. Apologize for not asking to see her first. You didn't want to impose, but you needed to see her. Understood? Say your sorry straight away. That would be the best. OK, I'll tell her you sent me... -No! If she says anything about me, you keep on talking. Don't even mention me! It will be better for Lovro if you do so. I'm not here. Thank you. Goodbye. You can have a seat. Where is he? Sini?a, I'm not at that stage yet. After all. I used to have an apartment here. It was my brother's. He was a saint. I'd have it still, but it all went to shit. It was all stolen, get it? His wife divided his apartment in two parts. That bitch got her hands on so much... She'd put her claws into you without you even noticing. I really like this neighborhood. It's nice, quiet... Everything's here. A pharmacy, a library, a supermarket... Everything. Good people, good neighbors. No shouting, screaming or fighting. You know everybody. People are shit. Shit. Vlado, I hope you had breakfast this morning. The woman sent me an e-mail. I was so surprised, but pleasantly. She thanked me for letting her son pass my subject. The way she wrote it was beautiful. The text was so embellished. She thanked me from the bottom of her heart. I was surprised how eloquent she was. She was so kind, I almost cried. Sanda, did you bring this? Slavonian chutney? -Of course. Can I? -Sure. I was just saying, Lovro's mom... What's her name? -Ru?ica. Dad's name is Slavko. -Slavko? Ru?ica and Slavko? Such archaic names. Cute! She works in a casino. -Really? She sent me an e-mail. I almost cried. It got me so endeared. She's thanking me for everything... Beautiful! You know what they say... When your life is down in the dumps, when it's all terrible, you can always find consolation in others. That's true. -Isn't it? It's true when they say God is among people. He's here, with us, within relationships. Within a man. -Exactly. Food's good, isn't it? -Excellent. Veronika... -Is this homemade? Veronika! I love this pickled food... I'd like some more, please. What about you? -I'm on a diet. I'm starting on Monday. What is this? Children, put that donkey up there! Have you gone mad? That's part of our set. You too, did you go pee? Do that one more time and you're going home. And you're out of the play! Ozana, let go of that haystack, it's fine. Anamarija, do you remember? You'll be up there with the others, behind the curtains. That's how we start. Don't forget! Are we waiting because of this? -No, I'm ready. It won't be long now. Are you about to begin? -Yes. Don't worry. -I'll keep my fingers crossed. Anamarija, come here for a sec. Did you hear this? -What? He told me you advised him not to run against me. He didn't listen to you. She talked him into it and now he's running. She asked him to do it? -Yes! They'll both get elected, for sure. See what a cunt he is? Now they're some kind of "pals". Where is she? -I've no idea. I can't stand anymore. Would you bring me a chair? There she is! There's mommy! It's so hot here. Where's your class? -Dad... What are you talking about? She doesn't have her own kids. She's not a teacher! I've told you a hundred times! They're all hers, isn't that right, Nikola? -That's right. Go on... I can't find her. Ozana isn't here. She's disappeared. I've no idea where she is. Where's Vedrana? -I don't know. You're bleeding. -Give me a handkerchief. Don't put your head back. Put it down and press here. Sit. Put your head down. Want some water? -Yes. Who's in charge of this? Whose show is this? What's wrong? Anamarija, is the AC running? I don't feel anything. It's on. It's freezing in here. Oh, dear, I don't feel good. My stomach's twisting like I'm gonna throw up, but I can't. Play's on hold. We can't get it moving. Don't let them begin, nothing moves before I come. It hurts so bad. I don't know what's wrong with me. I might die in here... Drink down some water and throw up. Drink it all up. Drink up. Drink up! -I can't. I can't. Let me help you. More! Bottoms up. More. You saved me, Ana Marija. -Well done. Now throw up. Don't let them move before I come! Turn it on. -Huh? Just do it. -OK. Are we on? I don't get it. What is this? Are we moving with it? -No, nothing should move! And yet it moves! THE STAFFROOM
