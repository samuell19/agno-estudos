APPLAUSE AND CHEERING Hey! Very nice! Hello, I'm Jimmy Carr and this is The Inbetweeners Fwends Reunited. Ah, friend. LAUGHTER We're going to be celebrating ten years of Will, Simon, Jay and Neil. The Inbetweeners was famous for its offensive jokes, rude language and juvenile sense of humour. Naturally, I'm a massive fan. I've watched everything they've ever done, and if I've learned one thing, I'd be very surprised. Join me as we spend the next two hours balls-deep in nostalgia and clunge. Tonight, all four of the boys are back, along with the celebrity fans, some of our favourite supporting cast members, and Greg Davies. And we've got exclusive, unseen footage. The first ever Inbetweeners Awards, and at the end of the show, we'll be crowning the best-ever Inbetweeners moment as voted for by you, the fans of the show. All that, and one lucky superfan is going to be winning their very own yellow Fiat. Check out the Clunge Mobile. CHEERS AND APPLAUSE Oh, yeah! But before all that, let's remind ourselves why we love The Inbetweeners so much. MOCKING LAUGHTER Come on, guys! Look what you've done. Christ, I've only had it a day! You're in the shit. Feisty one, you are. Oh, friend. Friend! See you later, friend. Shit! Ooh, fuck. APPLAUSE So, without further ado - they were too old to play teenagers ten years ago. God only knows what they look like now. Please welcome the four most famous virgins in the country, the original Undateables, Simon Bird, James Buckley, Joe Thomas and Blake Harrison. CHEERING AND APPLAUSE Amazing. Of course. Good to see you. All right? Good to see you. Come on in. Sit down. How are you? Good to see you. Thanks for being here. God bless you. You all right, Blake? OK, thanks. Come on in. Cheers. I love the show, but I'm, like everyone else that watches the show, I realise you're actors. Like, you're real people in the real world, but I get confused. So, I made you stickers. OK. So, I've got that for you. OK. That's... That's, uh... James, not Jay. OK. Yeah. Do you want me to put this on? Yeah. Genuinely, yeah. Because otherwise the whole show will be shit. Simon, not Will. Simon not Will. Simon not Will. Thanks. There you go. I've got Jimmy, not Alan. Nice! I love it. So, it's been ten years. When did you first realise it was going to be a hit? Because obviously, there's not many shows that you do, like, a ten-year anniversary of. It's been a huge cultural hit. I think it was when I got a call asking if we wanted to do a ten-year anniversary that I realised it was... I know after the first series, you had to go back to work, didn't you? Yeah. Big time. Yeah. What did you do, Simon? I was a student. Me and Joe lived together. Joe was tutoring. I was doing a PhD. And you guys are, uh...? You two knew each other before. And what was it like being thrown together? You hadn't met before the show, right? No. No, I think I was cast last, as well. I think I auditioned about, like, a week before rehearsals. So, you nearly didn't go to the audition, right? Yeah. I'd done three days of training at this call centre, and got the audition through Spotlight, and I phoned my mum and I was, like, "Oh, I've got no money." And she wasn't going to help me out. And you know, I do two more days of this call centre stuff, then I'll start getting paid and do the call centre. You had to complete the training. And she was, like, "Well, you've just done drama school. "You're an actor. Go to the audition." I went, "Oh, all right, then." Went to the audition and did not do the call centre. So, there you go. Any regrets? Obviously. Three of them, yeah. Well, in the audience tonight we've got the supporting cast from the show. Emily Head is here, I believe, with her father, Anthony Head. Very nice to have you here. APPLAUSE Anthony, you're an incredibly handsome, brilliant actor. How did you get cast as Will's dad? My daughter pulled strings. She pulled more than that. EMILY: What?! Belinda Stewart-Wilson's here, aka Will's fit mum. AUDIENCE WHOOPS APPLAUSE Hi. What was the most difficult thing about working on The Inbetweeners? I found sitting in the read-throughs, in front of many, many, many people and listening to four age-inappropriate boys talking with unswerving regularity about my vagina. It was uncomfortable. What can I say? Your vagina? Well. That goes without saying. That's not what I've heard. So, Iain and Damon, the creators of the show. I think Damon's here. What was it like working with them? They were not like authority figures at all. Did they ever tell... I believe they told you off a bit. I tried to tell on James to them. Oh, yeah. I was getting this thing wrong over and over again, and we got to take ten and just before they called, "Action," James went, "Oh, double figures." It is good to get over the line. I was, like, "You're so selfish." I just can't fathom the selfishness of just doing a joke when it's actually ruining our own show. On a comedy show. And they said, "What was it?" And I was, like, "Oh, it's double figures." And they were, like, "Oh, that's very funny." On the four of you working, who was the least professional? I was going to say everyone apart from Blake but, yeah, it was James, actually. It was definitely James, yeah. He'd never learn... Go on. ..his lines. Yeah. And never rehearsed. One rehearsal week, for the second film, and the whole rehearsal week was just a week-long argument about whether or not we should be rehearsing. There was just this argument just going on. Like, that was the week. To be fair... Like a really unproductive summit about whether to rehearse. It wasn't unproductive, mate. We got you into that suitcase, didn't we? You did, actually. It's always about trying to fit Joe into stuff. It was productive - I did successfully get in the suitcase. We did get you in the suitcase, didn't we? That's true, yeah. Are you normal? Well, there's a question. I think we've got a clip. So, this is you being stuffed in a bag. That's me. That's Damo there, overseeing it. That's Iain. Iain. I'm totally compliant! APPLAUSE That was Iain and Damon as well, who was encouraging us to behave that way. So, Iain and Damon then directed the second film. I remember one of the rehearsal days for the second film was the day... One of the rehearsals was the scene where we're sat by the car and it looks like... Get in that. To be fair, that's ideal. This is huge, mate. CHEERS AND APPLAUSE This isn't even fun. Just get in there, mate. Get it over with. Get down. Why? Why is he doing it? Why is he doing it? He could have said no. He could so easily have said no. ENCOURAGING CHEERS Go on, get it zipped up. You've put on weight a bit, Thomas. Those ten years have not been kind. That's not going. I'm disappointed. You've ruined everything. All these people. Say sorry to everyone, Joe. I'm sorry. APPLAUSE I love the show, but there's moments in it that are just, even when you're watching it on your own, it's kind of cringey. The embarrassment of those teenage years, and I think that's why everyone relates to it. What did your parents make of it when they watched it? I only watched it with them once, and it was me being wanked off. I don't know what I thought was going to happen. "Oh, maybe this'll be the episode where..." And you was doing that while you were watching it? Greg Davies is here. APPLAUSE Hello. Mr Gilbert. Hi, Jimmy. Lovely to have you here. Lovely to be here. LAUGHTER Wow. You are quite the actor. Now, you played Mr Gilbert. Obviously, the brilliant teacher. You were a teacher in real life. How close was it to your teaching technique? Gilbert is a psychopath. I had all the instincts that Gilbert had, but it's illegal to act on them the way that he did. I mean, I hate children. I mean, deep within my soul. Was there anyone as bad as Will? I mean, you really took an instant dislike. Yeah. Well, Simon and I, there was an instant animosity between us, you know, when we met, so channelling that white-hot hatred became barely acting. I feel this overwhelming aggression. Just with the slightest green light, I could windmill into him now. I can't even look at him. I can't even look at his stupid little face now. You going to let him get away with that? That's all right. I'll handle him later. Don't worry about that. I'll fuck you up, Bird. I'll fuck you up. Fuck away... I mean it, Jimmy. I'll destroy him. I mean... Like you destroyed his mum at the end of the second film. Right. At the end of the night, we'll be revealing the best Inbetweeners moment ever, as voted for by you, the fans of the show. Although I won't lie - the last time the public were given an important vote, they fucked it right up. But there's one thing every two-hour celebration of a beloved TV show needs - filler. And tonight, we're picking up the slack with our very own Inbetweeners' Awards. The first award is Best Bodily Malfunction. Here to present it, it's star of Fresh Meat, Zawe Ashton. APPLAUSE Hey, Zawe. How are you? Good to see you. Hi. How are you? I'm very well. Now, you starred with Joe in Fresh Meat where he plays, like, a nerdy virgin. Is it acting, though? I don't know, to this day, really, if it was 100% a craft or whether it was just... Yeah. You're here to present this beautiful award, some expense spared there, I think. The award for Best Bodily Malfunction. Let's take a look at the nominations. VOICEOVER: Best Bodily Malfunction. I'm really sorry. I think maybe I ate something. Could we maybe sit down and talk about us, and have you got any Nurofen, it's just... Oh, dear. STOMACH GURGLES Oh, God, no. Phil? BOWELS BURBLE AND CREAK Phil? SQUELCHING SOUNDS Oh, no. Phil? Oh, Jesus. I thought it was a fart, sir. I thought it was safe. Sorry, Si. I got no more piss. That's all right, mate. Thanks for trying. Hang on. There was that bit. Hello. Who's that? Oh, God! Oh, I'm so sorry. Don't worry, love. I've seen it all before. They're all good. Oh, I hope it's piss in face. Hope it's piss in face. Go on, tell us who the winner is. And the winner of Best Bodily Malfunction is... ..Simon's sick. APPLAUSE Emily Head and Joe Thomas, please. Um, I guess, really, just my parents. Um, thank you. Um... And all those people who maybe I've seen vomit. Um... Uh... And I think I've taken something from each and every one of you, and this makes it all worthwhile. So, thank you. But there was someone who stood there and got vomited on, and I really think that this award belongs to him. I think that's very fair. Yeah. I believe he's here tonight. Carli's little brother. It's Deo Simcox. Come on up. APPLAUSE Hello. How, are you? Good, thank you. Sir, you know what? Grab the award. You deserve that. Also, thanks for coming as a miniature version of me. LAUGHTER I haven't really grown much since then, really, to be honest. So, you're the ideal height to get sick on. I might try now. Well, round of applause. Best Bodily Malfunction. Thank you very much. Well done. Thank you very much. Right. Now it's time for a trip down Memory Lane, so we asked four men to drive a car none of them ever actually owned to a school none of them went to in an attempt to conjure up some memories of a fake adolescence they never experienced. Sounds great. Let's see how they got on. Hello. All right? All right? Yay. What are we doing? Here we are. So, where are we going? We're going to the school. You know, the school where we filmed series one and series two of The Inbetweeners. Just four men in their 30s going off to a school. Four men. There's nothing wrong with that. It's fine. Oh, yeah, I had to get this moustache cleared before they let me anywhere near the school. Yeah, yeah. I haven't driven a manual in ages. Whoa, whoa. Brake, brake, brake, brake! That's quite good. There's a bit in The Inbetweeners where you do your driving test. There is, yeah. They had to add it to the Thorpe Park episode. That was the first week, wasn't it? Week one. CAR BUMPS OVER POTHOLE Fuck! Jesus, Joe. No-one knew what The Inbetweeners was. We didn't know what The Inbetweeners was. Wasn't called The Inbetweeners. It was called Baggy Trousers. Yeah. Shall we talk about some of the other names that it might have been called? Dickheads. Dickheads. Desperadoes. One, Two, Three, Four, I think, was... One, Two, Three, Four! Yes! Legends. No-one knew who we were, and so there was these guys making a TV show and Blake walking around in Speedos. Yeah, that was the worst. One of the worst days of my life, mate. Someone just shouting out, "What is that?" Not, "Who is that?" but, "What is that?" at me, walking around in red Speedos? That is the one thing I had forgotten about The Inbetweeners, is The Tired. The tiredness, and also the coldness. Tired and cold. Tired and cold! Just kept filming it during the winter. And we were outside all the time. On lakes, on rivers. We were constantly in water. At the seaside. Why am I always in water? Where's my costume? Why haven't I got any clothes to wear?! "Now, if you can bob back under, Joe, that would be great." "I'm drowning." "OK, just bob under. We haven't got the shot, Joe. Just bob under." "I'm drowning." "Are you going to use that shot?" "No." SOMEONE FARTS James! Fucking hell. Oh, that is bad. That's disgusting. That is so bad. What about this - I have to open my window cos yours doesn't work, so it just blows even more past my nose and mouth. That stinks! It's tradition. What a wonderful tradition. There's a bus there. We could do a... Oh, yeah. We could re-enact. Some of the famous catchphrases. Famous catchphrases. Friend! Ah, wanker buses. Show him the lines that you stashed, James, from the old days. Are they in here? I doubt it. They can't be. They're in your head rest, in there. No way! They can't be. Honestly, in your head rest, there are some lines. That's amazing. Fucking hell! The camping trip. Shall we do it? Shit! Whoa. Oh, my God. Sorry, mate. My head's a mess. What if I have to go to the birth? Can you imagine how grim that'll be, watching that baby getting squeezed out of her arse? I imagine it's me? Oh, Neil! Right, it wasn't news, Neil. I can't believe that fucking script is there. That's amazing. I'm going to keep that in there. That's incredible. Where, are we? School. Good. Here we are. TYRES SCREECH Joe, I just took my seat belt off. Oh, we made it. Yeah, we made it. Oh, I can't believe we survived. OK. That's gone well. Here we are. Here we are, then. Oh, the boys are back. Fashion show was in here. Yeah. That was probably the day I wished I was in work the most, just to see Joe walking around with his ball out. You can see it whenever you want. The people in the audience didn't know what was going on, and the first take the camera was on them to get real reactions. Yeah, to get real reaction. What it was like to see... Let me tell you, they weren't laughing. They looked sort of cross. Yeah. Mortified? Angry. The wedgie corridor. Anybody want to do a wedgie? Yeah, I'll do it. I'll give you a little wedgie. Fucking come on then. I like it! They fit. It's a weird thing to do, I think. The exam hall. That's where you shit yourself. The scene of my greatest triumph. Yeah, I probably shit myself about... Probably about here, I imagine. I'd been up all night. Did you get method and kind of do that for real? No. And we kept working after the first series as well, didn't we? Yeah. I worked at Madame Tussauds between the first and second series. I was working at Madame Tussauds in the Scare Chamber. You were fitting kitchens. It was really good. I remember turning up to Howdens to pick up a kitchen for a client, and The Inbetweeners had been on the night before, and some bloke was just, like, "You're off the telly." I was, like, "Yeah." "What're you doing here?" I went, "Picking up a kitchen for someone." Oh, it's weird, innit? It's mad, innit? It felt so much bigger back then. Do you think kids think, "Oh, this was where they shot The Inbetweeners"? There should be a little blue plaque, really. There should definitely be a blue plaque. APPLAUSE My favourite scene was when everybody was talking about banging Will's mum. She's fit. And they ask Will, "If your mum wasn't your mum, "would you bang her?" Well, if she's my mum, no. But if she wasn't? I like it when Neil is wondering whether or not pesto is food for humans. What's this pesto? Is it for humans? No, it's for extra-terrestrials. That's why we keep it in the fridge. Jay has it into his head that one of the women that works in the ice cream stall is known for doing naughty things. Do you wanna lick it? Sorry? My Cornetto. Do you wanna lick it? Poor Will, in the loo, with Jay's dad. Mr Cartwright, you seem to be splashing me a bit. Jay's dad is just so awful. Better out than in. I'm going to go now, then. Welcome back to Friends Reunited, a ten-year anniversary special celebrating all things Inbetweeners. APPLAUSE I tell you what? Jessica Knappett's here. Hi, Jessica. How, are you? Now, you were in the movie, right? I was. And you were Blake's hot piece in the movie? That's how I like to be described, yeah. That's what's on my CV. Have you got a question for the boys? You guys famously danced towards us in the movie, which was hot. LAUGHTER What is the worst chat-up line that you guys have ever delivered? Have you seen The Inbetweeners? That is the only way you're getting laid. I once said to a girl at university, "Before I met you, all I could think about was history. "Now all I can think about is you." OK. What was the worst thing you saw on a script and went, "Oh, I've got to say that to another human being"? The worst thing I had to do, I can't remember any lines, but I had to throw a Frisbee in a disabled girl's face. I mean, the reality of that, in TV terms, is, we did, like, a wide shot where I threw a Frisbee, but then there's a close-up where the girl has to be hit in the face with a Frisbee, and I remember there was a props man standing on a ladder with a stack of 10 or 15 Frisbees, and Frisbees are quite hard, and just whacking them in this girl's face, to make sure they got the shot. And I remember standing there watching that and thinking, "This feels like a low point." But you had to say some horrible stuff to an old lady. Yeah, I had to ask a sweet old lady if she would suck me off. What about in the show? Yeah, in the show. Now, The Inbetweeners were famously bad with the opposite sex, and to demonstrate that, we've invited a collection of their failed romances. Let's meet them. Hi. Now, The Inbetweeners was a masterclass in how to treat and talk to women. Oh, definitely. Am I right, love? Totally. Were there any on-set romances? Definitely not for me. OK. Snog, marry, avoid, kill. Can I marry Blake? Blake is one of my favourite people in the world. They're all gonna go for Blake. What? To kill and marry and...? OK. So, you'd marry Blake? Yeah. Sorry to his actual wife, but yes. That's all right. They're good friends, so it's fine. They're good friends? Oh, friends. Yeah. AS BLAKE: Oh, Blake's wife's friend. Well done. OK. If you had to shag one of those. Blake. Blake as well? OK. Now it's time for our next award, Most Romantic Moment, and here to present it, taking a break from his busy schedule, sitting by the phone waiting for it to ring, it's Peter Andre. Hi, guys. Which one of The Inbetweeners boys do you most relate to? Probably Simon, and I'd say it's because I thought I was cool, and I wasn't, at school. I was Greek, I had curly hair, I had an English accent. I was living in Australia, so it's different times. And then these guys went to Australia and took my car with them. Oh, yeah. You're in the second movie. Did you know you were gonna be in the movie? No, and here's the thing. Look at that. Yeah. Brilliant. Oh. So, do you know what happened, right? So, these people rang me and said, "You're not gonna believe this. "You're in The Inbetweeners 2 movie," so I was, like, "That's amazing," and then I saw it and I went, "Oh, yeah. "Why didn't they take me with them? "I would have loved to have gone and done that." Right. Awards. What award are you presenting? I am presenting the Most Romantic Moment and here are the nominations. Yeah. # And the first time ever I kissed your mouth # I felt your heart so close to mine... # Why don't you start? Every time I don't want one, it's there, and yet the one time I actually need it, nothing. OK, you're scaring me now. Just work, you stupid fucking thing. Get big. Get big. Simon... Why aren't you doing it? Do it! Get big. Oh, please, just work! Oh, yeah. Tell me you love me. Tell me you love me. Oh, yes, I love you. Get out. I'm... just looking at holidays. It's just holidays! God. We're off. Right. Won't be a minute. I'll just finish up here. What about...? She won't mind. We're not kissing. Nah, it's just fingers, in't it, luvvie? Right. Yeah, I'll catch you lot up. One second. He's definitely picked up the pace. APPLAUSE The Most Romantic Moment winner is... ..Will singing. It was brilliant. Come on, Will. Thanks very much. Well done. Thank you very much. Please. Cheers. Well, what an honour. This is for every child out there with a dream. Maybe one day you can devise a scenario in which you get given awards by an Australian muscle man. Um... Thank you very much. Cheers. I've got a question. For that scene, you learned to play the guitar, right? That's right, yeah. And you learned a song on the guitar? I did, yeah. What song did you learn? I learned You're Beautiful by James Blunt, because that's what we thought the song would be. Then James Blunt didn't give us the rights to use it, so I spent three months learning guitar and playing You're Beautiful on loop, having that rattling around my head, which is great because, thankfully, it's such a fucking good song. Ladies and gentlemen, Will the singer. And Peter Andre. Peter, thank you so much. Thanks. Right. Stonehenge, the Bayeux Tapestry, Inbetweeners series one to three, all cultural legacies that have helped define our national identity. But how did The Inbetweeners get started? Let's take a look. It's hard to imagine now, but there was a time when Britain didn't know what the word "clunge" meant. There was a time when no TV show had ever featured a fish being punched to death in a rowing boat, and, yes, there was a time when the word "bus" had never been paired with the word "wankers". So, how did this cultural masterpiece come into existence? I'm Neil Oliver, archaeologist, historian and part-time Loki lookalike. A Loki-like. I want to take you back to a bygone era. It's the first day of May 2008. Nickelback are riding high in the charts. GRINDR is just another tool for a workman, and ADELE is just a type of computer. On a digital channel called E4, a new sitcom is launching. It's called The Inbetweeners. Bus wankers! Briefcase wanker. Oh, friend. Fuck you lot. Where's the beer? The show's writers and creators, Iain Morris and Damon Beesley, are often mentioned in the same sentence as Shakespeare. The Inbetweeners was THEIR magnum opus. Damon and I were living together and we talked a lot about sitcoms we loved, like Alan Partridge, and The Office and Fawlty Towers, and we were like, "Imagine if, one day, "we could write our own sitcom." We just gathered up all the funny stories that we had about, you know, childhood, our friends, things that had happened to us and were continuing to happen to us, and it felt like that would be the perfect sort of delivery vehicle. That would be, like, the four boys, you know, at that age, doing sixth form, not yet men, you know, in the eyes of the world, but actually, technically, adults. And it gave rise to Damon and Iain's teen opus Baggy Trousers, originally set in the 1980s, and soundtracked by such bands as the Happy Mondays, who are kind of like an all-male Mancunian version of Little Mix. You can stick our music on anything as long as it pays. I don't give a fuck. After many drafts, E4 commissioned a pilot which featured a different set of lead actors, with one exception. James Buckley. I wasn't always Jay. I was originally cast as Neil. No, your mum's so fit, Will, I reckon she could be a prostitute. My Neil would have been better than Blake's. The proof is out there. I'm not being funny, like, a high-class one that comes in a limousine. But apparently the pilot is so bad that human eyes aren't allowed to see it. The channel commissioned a series, but wanted it in a contemporary setting with a new cast. Undeterred, James Buckley re-auditioned. When we shot the pilot, things didn't quite work, but one thing that did happen was that we found Buckley, off camera, just incredibly funny and annoying and a wind-up. I was, like, "Is he lying about that? "It sounds like he's bullshitting." I think we all realised he'd been tragically miscast and that he could potentially have been a Jay. On holiday in Spain one year, me and my mate took a pedalo out and we went to Africa. I can show you a DVD of me leaping over five lorries on Blue Peter, if you like. Private poker tournament with Danny Dyer and the Krays. Aren't the Krays dead? No. That's just a cover story cos they done a bunk from prison. Damon went, "We should get him to read for Jay, shouldn't we?" and I was, like, "We definitely should." He denies it vehemently, but there's definitely a fair slice of Jay in James Buckley. The thing is, I probably could have done any of the parts but I can only play one. The further castings for the series were rigorous and extensive. Yeah. I mean, it should be on record that Iain and Damon definitely didn't want me to be in the show. I mean, they made that very clear on several occasions. They said I was too old. True. They said I was too camp. Also true, to be fair. Simon Bird was eventually cast, but Iain and Damon did reject Matt Smith, aka Doctor Who. Twats. Neil became the last part that we cast, and it was almost the last day. I think it was the last session. And Blake walked in and was just Neil, like immediately. At that point, you're a bit like, "OK, the band is complete. "We've got 'em now." With the cast finally in place and director Gordon Anderson on board, the world would soon have its first glimpse of The Inbetweeners we all know and love. Inside these ancient manuscripts are the first reviews of the show. This one is the Radio Times. Way back then, it was like the Sky EPG but printed on paper. It reads, "The writers are in their 30s "and the cast blatantly in their 20s. "Nothing rings true, and there are few proper jokes." Wow. Sick burn. But all E4 cared about were the viewing figures, which is a shame, because they were terrible, too. In one tragic week, the show was beaten in the ratings by low-budget reality show spin-off Big Brother Audition Tapes, and it wasn't even a good series of Big Brother. It was the crap one, with Lisa and Mario and someone called Darnell. Dude, I'm Darnell from that series of Big Brother, and even I don't remember it. With the critics labelling the show puerile, and ratings low, would this spell the end of The Inbetweeners? Well, obviously not, because this is part of the tenth anniversary show, but, you know, trying to end on a cliff-hanger. Clunge - noun, Positive. The clunge is a sumptuous part of the female reproductive anatomy. While the desire to plunge a clunge is lyrically pleasing, there is a negative correlation between someone's usage of the word and their likelihood of ever seeing one. APPLAUSE Welcome back to The Inbetweeners: Fwends Reunited, our celebration of the most puerile show on TV, you gaylord bumders. We all had that special teacher who changed our lives. Mine was Mr Kennedy. Mr Kennedy taught me so much. He taught me Geography, sure, but he also taught me to stand up for myself. He taught me to find my place in the world, and perhaps most importantly, he taught me, "Don't neglect the balls." Ever wondered what The Inbetweeners would look like if the boys had transitioned and moved to Ireland? Well, Channel 4 did, and here to present the Best Teacher award, it's Derry Girls. APPLAUSE Hello. Hi, the Derry Girls. Very nice to see you. Are you fans of The Inbetweeners? Of course. We are the superfans you announced earlier. It's us. Yeah. Right, so which award are you presenting? Best Teacher. A lot of competition for this one. We have no idea which Greg is gonna win it, so it's... yeah. I suppose we should probably have a look at the nominees. Yeah. So, if you do find yourself at a loose end next year and think it might be nice to pop in and see how we're getting on, don't. This isn't The Dead Poets' Society and I'm not that bloke on BBC TWO who keeps getting kids to sing in choirs. I assure you that once my legal obligation to look after your best interests is removed, I can be one truly nasty fucker. As I'm sure you're aware, there's been a spate of vandalism recently, culminating in someone adapting the flower display by the main road so that it now reads, "We come tit village". HE STIFLES A LAUGH Oh, you think that's funny, do you, McKenzie? Well, a bit. Doesn't even make sense. "We come tit village"? What kind of morons would do that? I think you know exactly who did it. What? And if you don't tell me who did it, in my role as your UCAS referee, I will fuck your application up. He had to walk back through the town centre, sopping wet and barely clothed, Mr Gilbert. Ha! I'd hoped you'd take this more seriously. He wrote to the paper especially to get work experience and instead, I'm picking frog spawn out of his underpants. Would you excuse me just for a second? HE CACKLES Ohhh! And who have we under here? McKenzie, sir. Oh, let me guess. No-one saw how this happened. I suppose you tripped. No, sir. What happened is... Sorry, McKenzie. You're not about to grass, are you? But sir, if no-one reported crimes, the justice system would collapse and... I'll ask you again. How did this happen? I tripped. Tsk! Clumsy. APPLAUSE OK. And the winner is... Dramatic pause. ..Mr Gilbert! CHEERING AND APPLAUSE Hello. Hello. Wonderful speech that you've prepared. Yeah, I have. I've actually written one because I had a good feeling about this. HE CLEARS HIS THROAT Thank you. I'd like to dedicate this award to all the children I taught in real life when I was a teacher. The Inbetweeners, for me, was the big break I needed to leave you all behind. I'd love to tell you that I look back fondly on those years, but I don't. It was a living hell. But just because I've moved on, don't think that I don't monitor your lives on social media. I genuinely do. Where, for example, are you now, Gary Simmons? You were pretty damn cocky in my classroom, weren't you? And now, thanks to Facebook, I know that you are a divorced father of two, and that after 20 years, you're still working in your dad's fucking shop. APPLAUSE Greg Davies, everyone. Give him a round of applause. Nailed it. Nailed it. Nailed it. And the Derry Girls, give them a round of applause. Thank you so much. God love you. The Derry Girls. I love the fact one of the Derry Girls is a boy and we never reference it. Please tell me that's the genuine, genuine name. No. His real name's BLEEP. Of course, there are other Inbetweeners' teachers in the room. Amanda St John, you played the fit biology teacher, Miss Timbs. I did, yes. Fantastic. And we've also got Waen Shepherd, aka "Paedo" Kennedy here. APPLAUSE Thank you. Shall we treat ourselves to a little look at "Paedo" Kennedy in action? Hello? It's only me, boys. Just on my way to bed. Thought I'd check how you are. Ooh, swimming's tiring. Are your legs tired? I think they're OK. Yes. Quick massage before bedtime. Ahh, tired legs. Ooh. Come on, John. Oh. Rub down to shift the lactic acid? Not now, John. Oh. APPLAUSE Can I ask, was it typecasting? Yep, pretty much. I know it must have been difficult because you're not a real... teacher. But obviously, for legal reasons, we have to say you are not a paedophile, but if you had to fuck one of the boys? Nah, sorry. They're all too old for me now. Come on. "Paedo" Kennedy! Ladies and gentlemen, please give it up for Waen Shepherd. Fabulous. I think the most Inbetweener thing that's happened to me was... ..all my mates were trying to get into this club and I had this ID that wasn't mine. You know this is an Australian driving licence? Yep. The bouncer looked at me, looked at the ID and was like, "Spell your name." And I couldn't. So you're Australian. That's right, mate. A friend, I can't even name him, but he took his mum and dad's car and we went out in it, and he, like, slightly crashed it. Rather than just driving it home with a slight dent in the car, we burnt the car. Oh, no! There was a guy in our school who did a shit in the showers. GURGLING Oh, no. We always said, "You shit yourself," and he said, "It was sand." And it wasn't. It was shit. I thought it was a fart, sir. I thought it was safe. Ever since The Inbetweeners hit our screens ten years ago, it spawned a legion of devoted fans and we've scoured the land and found four of the most obsessive superfans. Let's meet them. We've got Matt. Matt, take the bucket off your head. That's Matt. He's a superfan. We've got Paul. APPLAUSE Paul, take the bucket off your head. We've got Jason. Hi. APPLAUSE And we've got Rachel. Pop your buckets down. Right. OK. Matt, how big a fan of The Inbetweeners, are you? Huge, huge. Maybe top 2%, 1%? I'm bingeing it three, four times a year, and it makes me feel normal, which is great. Aw! You're adorable. What's your Inbetweeners claim to fame? So, a few years ago, at our university summer ball, me and a few friends dressed as The Inbetweeners and I was Will, and we made the car as well, out of cardboard, and drove it through the streets of Cardiff. I think we've got clips of the car. Yes! Whoa! Yes, go! APPLAUSE Simon, were you impressed by your superfan? I'm very impressed, yeah. Keep it up? I don't know. Well, next up, we've got Paul. Paul, how big a fan are you? Massive fan. I've watched the show that many times, I've had to replace the DVDs twice. I went to see the first film twice in one day and then another few times after that. Just can't get enough, really. Wow. This is nice, Joe. You're meeting the man who's clearly going to murder you. Yeah. No, it'd be a great honour. What's your Inbetweeners claim to fame? It was my now wife's 21st birthday. I needed something a bit more special. I mean, I was gonna propose anyway, but something a bit different as well. So, I hunted their agents down, sent them a nice, grovelling letter saying, "Sign this card," basically, "Send her a birthday card home for her 21st.". And did they all sign the card? It's funny you should ask. The one question that always gets asked is, "There's four Inbetweeners and you've got three cards.". So, who didn't sign the card? LAUGHTER I didn't sign the birthday card. Apparently. I'm really sorry! Come on. Shall we crack on? Yeah. He's not like his character, is he? So, Jason. How big a fan of the Inbetweeners, are you? You've had reconstructive surgery. I'm a massive fan. All right, mate. All right, mate. From literally the first episode, I found it hilarious. It was always gonna be a classic and obviously, having a little bit of a resemblance to one of the main characters was a bit of a bonus. Can we get you to, sort of, turn to each other, Abba-style, and look at each other, just to see how similar the...? Oh, wow. APPLAUSE OK, pretty good. Well, we come to Rachel. Hi, Rachel. How, are you? Hi. I'm good, thank you. How big a fan of The Inbetweeners are you? Well, I'm that big a fan that... I don't look like them, but I had a tattoo done. You've had a tattoo done? Yeah. Do you want to see? Yeah. 100%, let's see. Ooh. What? No! No! I'm sorry. Is that genuinely real? Yes, genuinely real. APPLAUSE Oh, Jesus! His face and the word clunge! It's really good. Can we get that expression? Let's get that expression. APPLAUSE Here are our Inbetweeners superfans. Give them all a round of applause. Amazing. And after the break, our superfans will be competing to win this. HORN HONKS You could be driving home in a state-of-the-art Fiat Cinquecento, Hawaii edition. Really? Really?! Yes, really. With top speeds of more than 85mph... 99... BOTH: 100mph! ..this super little runaround is packed with brilliant extras like hand-powered retractable windows... Bus wankers! ..all the latest mod cons... Oh, Christ, it's got a tape deck. ..and seating for five almost grown-up passengers in total comfort. Ow, something hard's digging into my leg! Don't look at me, although it could reach from here. So get ready to play for the ride of your life. Well, I don't think it's too bad. It's not great, though, is it? No. APPLAUSE Welcome back to The Inbetweeners: Fwends Reunited, a night where we celebrate the phenomenon that is The Rudge Park Four. Now, before the break we met our four superfans of The Inbetweeners and we teamed them with their heroes. They're now gonna be playing for their very own state-of-the-art yellow Fiat Hawaii. AUDIENCE: Ooh! A piece of shit if ever there was one. OK, let's start. So the first round is Complete Bullshit. APPLAUSE So simple - I'm gonna read out a classic Inbetweeners quote. All you have to do is buzz in and complete it. For example, if I said, "I'm gonna fuck your fucking fanny off, you..." AUDIENCE: Twat! Tell me you rehearsed that because if you didn't, I don't feel safe. OK, all right, you ready? Let's try and win one of you a car. OK, after Will buys alcohol for the boys and they bunk off school Simon asks Will, "Have you spent all out money on fancy fucking...?" BUZZER Birthday Card Friends. Crisps. Let's see if you're right. Have you spent all our money on fancy fucking crisps? You twat. That's correct. OK. Our next question - after the boys smoke a spliff for the first time, Will tells Jay, "Just because you've had a puff on your first joint doesn't make you..." who? BUZZER Birthday Card Friends. Kurt Cobain? Let's have a look and see if you're right. Just cos you've had a puff on your first joint doesn't make you Kurt Cobain. It's very good, that's very good. That's two. I would remind the other three, you are playing. After Simon reveals that he might be moving, Neil asks, "What is Swansea? Is it..." what? BUZZER Cardboard Car Friends. An animal. Let's have a look and see if you're right. What is Swansea? Is it an animal? APPLAUSE We're off to the races. Yeah, oh, you're back, you're in the game now. Oh, yeah. Look how excited his little face is. I like it. Whilst working as a toilet attendant in Australia, Jay says, "No Dolce and Gabbana, no sucky your..."? BUZZER Tattoo Friends. Banana? Let's have a look. No Dolce and Gabbana, no sucky your banana. APPLAUSE Fingers on buzzers. To ask the next question, it's John Seaward, AKA Big John, with Big John's Big Question. You could be friends with us. Hello. John Seaward here. My big question is this. At the Christmas prom planning meeting, Big John suggests burgers and which other food to the party? BUZZER Cardboard Car Friends. Lasagne. Well, let's have a look and see if you're right. Big John suggests burgers and lasagne. APPLAUSE Big John's Big Question. Definitely worth it. It's definitely worth it. OK, quickfire round cos the rest of it, I mean, really took some time. OK, fingers on buzzers, all still to play for. Not so much for you, Jason, if I'm honest. I'm only two behind. I can catch up. You can, yeah. It's all to play for, yeah, sure. The guy from Nine Inch Nails is probably gonna win, I mean... Why has he ironed his hair? We're all thinking it. OK, while in Australia, what does Jay tell the boys his DJ name is? BUZZER Birthday Card Friends. DJ Big Penis. That is the correct answer. APPLAUSE What is the nickname on the back of Neil's Pussy Patrol T-shirt? BUZZER Cardboard Car Friends. Mr Lady Killer. That is correct. APPLAUSE After returning to sixth form after the summer holiday, Simon sarcastically says, "He's had 210 wanks and he's..." BUZZER Look-Alike Friends. I have no idea, I just really know that we don't have a point yet and I'm hoping that he can bring something out of the bag. OK, you've buzzed in so I will have to accept your answer. What was the question? LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE I can't because we're giving away a car, so there's rules so I just need your answer. Oh, it's a shit car, there shouldn't be rules. You're right. OK, anyone else? BUZZER Birthday Card Friends. I think the answer's Peperami. That is correct. APPLAUSE So in the lead so far are The Rain Men. You may laugh - I'm taking these two to a casino afterwards. Genuinely, they're gonna be friends. OK, which roller-coaster do we see Will and the boys... BUZZER Cardboard Car Friends. Nemesis Inferno? That is the correct answer. APPLAUSE What is Mr Kennedy's first name? BUZZER Look-Alike Friends. Look-Alike Friends! Paedo Kennedy. OK... Let me just check. So I asked, "What's Mr Kennedy's first name?" and you think his first name might be Paedo? I'll look. Anyone else can buzz in. BUZZER Birthday Card Friends. John. Yes, of course, you're right. APPLAUSE What is the name on Jay's fake ID? BUZZER Tattoo Friends. Bret Clement. Correct. APPLAUSE Well done. OK. What drink does Neil take on the trip to Warwick? BUZZER Tattoo Friends. Orangeade. Correct. APPLAUSE And it's worth reminding viewers at home that these four have no life. And the contestants. OK, what is the full number plate on Simon's car? BUZZER Birthday Card Friends. Go on. M335 ALP. Yes. APPLAUSE Which dish does Will cook for his dinner guests on his birthday? BUZZER Cardboard Car Friends. Coq au vin. You are. That's the correct answer. APPLAUSE OK, next question. In series two, which pub do they go to after their last exam? BUZZER Look-Alike Friends. Look-Alike Friends. The Fox and Hounds. It's the correct answer. Yeah! APPLAUSE If you wank each other off, is that masturbation? We'll find out later. OK. The boys travel into London to go to which nightclub? BUZZER Look-Alike Friends. Astoria. Yes! We're on a roll! Last question. Which rock band do Will, Simon, Jay and Neil...? BUZZER Cardboard Car Friends. Fail-Safe. That is the correct answer. APPLAUSE OK, so it's a tie break between Birthday Card Friends and Cardboard Car Friends. How are you feeling? Are you feeling confident, Birthday Card Friend? Hmm, so-so. Cardboard Car Friends, how are you feeling? About that. Right. That could be any manner of things. And so it's all on this. For the shitty yellow car. Ooh! OK, here we go. It's the tie break question. How much is the fine for shitting on the... BUZZER Cardboard Car Friends. 50 euros. That's the right answer. APPLAUSE You've won the Cinquecento. Please, come to the car. You have won a Cinquecento. Come on, jump in. Sir, this is all yours. Good luck getting an MOT on it. Oh, my God, it HAS got a fucking tape deck. Incredible. OK, whilst we attempt to Febreze the shit out of the back seats of this, why don't you catch up with the next instalment of the history of The Inbetweeners? APPLAUSE Beneath the surface of this unremarkable woodland clearing lie many of the original Inbetweeners props, each one carefully buried as part of an ill-conceived tax dodge. Oh! Jackpot. Look! It's the unmistakable passenger door of a Fiat Cinquecento Hawaii. Sweet. That's a tenner on eBay right there. Anyway... when we left the story, The Inbetweeners was finally on TV but taking a battering in the ratings from a spin-off show from the shitiest series of Big Brother to date. Was this the end of the iconic comedy? No. It wasn't. The show was saved from the TV scrapheap by the sale of lots of this. This archaic technology is what you call a DVD. It's like a podcast with pictures. People used to spend good money on these, and so a second series was commissioned, this time with a new national catchphrase. Oh, friend, friend! Oh, friend. Ooh, friend! Friend! Friends. Sorry, that's not the catchphrase. Yeah, I know. It's the name of a fantastic sitcom. Wait a minute, what show are you talking about? We're in serious trouble here. What? Oh, what? That's only for emergencies! For emergencies! Channel 4 commissioned a second series, this time with Ben Palmer in the director's chair. The second series, it just jumped up to another strata, so we had 1.3 million viewers tuned in for the start of the second series and I think by the time we got to the third series, it had just gone through the roof. And the British Comedy Award goes to The Inbetweeners. And it did pick up awards - left, right and centre. Not that everyone in the comedy industry was happy about it. Can we say to the most important people...? So with all these viewers, DVD sales, online hits and awards, you can see how successful The Inbetweeners became. However, the show started to attract complaints, but why? What you should do if you have to kill a fish is use a sort of blunt instrument like a cosh or something like that and whack it behind the eye because that impacts the brain and ends its life. It was a dead fish and obviously had to punch it take after take after take and basically ended up with bruised knuckles the next morning, quite swollen, so the fish in a way got its own back. Many of the scenes that drew complaint were based on true-life events. Room for one more at the front. How can there possibly be room for only one more at the front? Oh, God, it was so bad. We queued up to get on this ride that had three seats at the front and when we got there there were already two people sitting in the front and they were closing the ride and I threw a huge fit. I mean, as a fully grown man, I threw a huge fit. Get them off! Get them off and make them move! Fucking pushing in! About how they should make these people move. Can't they read? The whole line says, "Three people only." What's wrong with these people? Are they stupid? Sir, if you could... Are they so dumb they think it's OK to push in?! Anyway, I sat down in the front, my friends sat behind me. I'll just get on and sit at the front next to these inconsiderate arseholes! I look to my right and it was two guys with Downs syndrome who had been sitting in the front that I'd been berating. I'm the worst human being in the world. I got off and people were just kind of booing me from the other queue and I was like, "Come on, we just need to leave the park. "We need to get out of here right now." I mean, it's pretty bad in the show but it was much worse in real life. The worst story line that happened to me that was in the show was the moment where Simon goes to an under-18 disco and is given... I mean, no other way of saying this, a hand job on the dance floor. Oh, what are you doing? Shall we go somewhere more private? I want you! Right, yeah. Careful, no-one's touched that before. It might go off! Oh, good. And I remember just the mad sort of tortured dance my brain was going through because like on the one hand I was aware how horrific this looked, the optics were not good on this, so it was quite brightly lit for a dance hall as well and my mates were literally like, three yards to the left of me as this was happening, but then on the other hand, you know, my teenage brain was like, "But no-one else has ever touched your genitals before". So it was horrific. Getting a bit weird now. I don't like it when he makes eye contact. None of us do, Neil. Yeah, that one is particularly raw still. After three series, the nation was begging for more Inbetweeners but the cast were looking well old so Iain and Damon decided to call it a day. That was until Film Four came forward with an offer to make a motion picture. Iain and Damon agreed because they're big fans of cinema and even bigger fans of money. But translating The Inbetweeners from the small screen to the big screen wasn't going to be easy. Oh, hang on, look - possible pot there, you see? No, it's just a wee jobbie. Jugasaurus Rex - from the Latin for "well-endowed reptile". The Jugasaurus Rex is a being who possess breasts at a cup size D or above. Like a peacock's tail, these breasts entrance young men, who are then vulnerable to emotional manipulation and forced coupledom. So what I've learnt from The Inbetweeners is... Never trust your friends when you're parking your car. Right, how much money have we got between us? No, you chose to park here. Just because someone's in a wheelchair doesn't mean they're not an arsehole. Even in this chair, I could kick your arse. I could kick your arse right in. Ow! Get out of the way when Jay is driving! It's road kill. See it every morning. Oh, no! Why did you do that? Not so clever now, is he? Don't do drugs. No. I think I might be dead. I learnt the word clunge. It's the ultimate clunge magnet. I'm off to find the clunge. Oh, I bet it's crawling with clunge. Big clunge fan, so it's nice to have clunge in my vocabulary. APPLAUSE Welcome back, bumbers, to The Inbetweeners: Friends Reunited, the only show that acknowledges sometimes you can put the balls in, too. LAUGHTER Right, let's talk about nudity in The Inbetweeners. Yeah, please. Let's talk about dicks. Go on. Now. you get naked in the show, don't you? You get your cock out? Yeah. Yeah. I didn't though, I was too scared. It was the first film I'd ever made, and they wanted me to get my penis out. And you didn't want to... because it's malformed? No, just cos it was... you know, no-one wants to get their penis out. So, yeah, they super-imposed this penis on me, and it was a small penis, and I just thought "Well, I could have done that." I was hoping they'd put something bigger in the way! I think we have some footage of you. Oh, good, thank you. CHILD: I no swim, I beg you. Not cool. Argh! All right. All right, it's just a joke. We're mates. CHILD LAUGHS So little, so little! Yeah, so... So that's... that's not your... ..that's not your cock and balls? No, it's not. Who is your, er, stunt cock? OK, so that guy... Yeah. ..he was offered to us by his grandmother. LAUGHTER And I believe he's here tonight. Cole Templeton, your cock double. Hi, how are you? APPLAUSE DROWNED BY APPLAUSE So, how did you get the job? You got...? It was actually my mum, not my grandmother. It was your mum? Yes. Oh, it was your mum? That makes it less weird. Sorry, yeah. Exactly. So she'd heard, "Oh, they're looking for someone with a small cock," and was like, "Oh, my boy!" Can I just say, this was in February and it was very cold. Let's give him a round of applause. What a gent. Now, we all know nothing embarrasses teenage boys more than their parents, so let's talk to The Inbetweeners' parents! APPLAUSE How you doing, Inbetweeners' parents. Hello, Jimmy. OK, most embarrassing thing you had to do on The Inbetweeners? That's probably the fashion show, where I was instructed by the director to stare at Joe's right testicle. LAUGHTER And I couldn't just fake it, it had to be exactly, that had to be the eye line. So I started at that for the best part of 25 minutes. Mesmeric, I imagine. Yes. Testacular. Yeah. Yeah. What? It's a dad joke! Worst thing? I think I kept my powder pretty dry, but I did have to get off with Greg Davis. Which wasn't embarrassing, it was just fun. Yeah, who wouldn't want a bounce on that? Do you get recognised in the street? Do people shout things at you, or...? Yeah, "You got a cock like a McDonald's chip". You get that shouted at you? I get that a lot, yeah. And do you think that's from the show? No. LAUGHTER OK. Ladies and gentleman, to present our next award, you might recognise him from sitting at the table earlier looking bored. I'd like to introduce one of my favourite comic actors, I'd like to but I can't, cos it's Greg Davis! # Show some love # You ain't so tough # Come fill my little world right up # Right up... # Hello, Greg, you all right? Having the time of my life! Lovely. I'm a bit nervous, I've just smashed a bag of crisps in the short time I was standing back there, so I'm just picking them out of my teeth. Right, well, a body like that doesn't just happen, does it? You know it. You know I've worked on it. Do you want me to crack on with it? No, you can just have a chat. I thought you had a chat with everyone else? Oh, yeah. Well, I was, you know... You've got to lead that, Jim. Oh, OK. Yeah. Favourite moment working on The Inbetweeners? I can't remember. LAUGHTER I don't. Not that the show's not memorable, the show's wonderfully memorable. I'm 50 years of age, I don't remember any of it. Right, I'm here to give out the award for best parent. You know how you've got the winner out and you're about to read it? Yeah. Don't do that. Yeah, don't do that. LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE I don't want to be that guy, but you had one job. And the nominations for best parent are... Where was it you were headed to again? Simon never tells me anything. Malia, Mr Cooper, in Greece. Can't say I've heard of it. Of course you haven't, it's a cool place to go. And it's got a Subways. Oh, right. In my day, it was all about Spain. Me and my mates went to Magaluf this one time. Shagaluf, we called it. Should have called it Shag-a-lot, and hard, anything that moved. We had a system. Always left a hat on the bedroom door when one of us got lucky. It was usually me. Oh, Dad, please shut up! I don't know what it is, but you'll find girls just seem to let themselves go a bit more abroad. It's like as soon as they smell the sun cream, they get wet. Your mother's the same, even now. Oh, God. Just drop us here! Don't worry son, there's a girl out there for you somewhere. You just need to find a desperate bird that likes the smell of BO and blokes with tiny cocks! Oh, and Neil, Will's a little bit stressed at the moment. Me not being around might bring on one of his migraines. If that does happen, there are special suppositories in the bathroom cabinet. Mum! It's the only thing that works. He's usually a bit sick, can't keep pain killers down. Just need to pop two in. In where? Well, they are suppositories, so in his bottom. Mum! For a joke? No, to stop his headache. Bye, Petal. Well, that is not happening. Seriously, I don't care if you're dying. I'm going nowhere near your arsehole. WILL IN VOICEOVER: Could this party get any worse? Turns out, it could! Oh, I say! What must you think of me racing around the house in my briefs like we're at some sort of Roman orgy? Neil will be back in a minute. He's just finishing off up after chess club. APPLAUSE You've already practised this bit, haven't you? No. Yeah, you should nail it. And the winner for best parent is... ..Jay's dad! # Hey, show some love # You ain't so tough... David Schaal, everyone. # Come fill my little world right up. # Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Congratulations. Thank you. Well done. I won this award for playing a bit of a prick, so I'd like to invite all the pricks at BAFTA to give me a BAFTA for playing a prick. David Schaal, Greg Davis, give them a round of applause. APPLAUSE Time now for another high brow look back at the TV show that gave us the phrase, "I'm gonna fuck your fucking fanny off, you twat." That's right, it's another instalment of the history of The Inbetweeners. MUFFLED I'm sorry, bear with. Bear with. There we go. In just three years, The Inbetweeners went from small screen to big screen, and the fans went wild. CHEERING The film was released in the summer of 2011 and the film crit... the... ..the film critics were all agreed, it changed the face of cinema forever. Citizen Kane, The Godfather, La Dolce Vita, they all pale into insignificance next to The Inbetweeners Movie. When I first saw it, I thought, "This is what cinema is all about." It was the greatest day of my life, and I include in that my wedding day and the birth of my two children, if I ever have any. With a budget of just £3.5 million... I think you're in my seat. Have you ever picked up teeth wi' broken fingers? On your way. With a budget of just £3.5 million, the producers had very modest aspirations for the film. Our ambition, really, at the beginning of it all was just, you know, not to fuck it up for the audience, and to hopefully, you know, people would go and see it. The film was huge. It smashed the record for the most successful opening weekend for a comedy film in the UK ever. It stayed at the top of the charts for four weeks, by which time it had made £42 million. Yes! Right, then, Si. Looks like the holiday starts here. # Pa pa l'americano. # The dancing scene. Oh, my word. In all my years of choreography, I've never seen anything so graceful! MUSIC: We No Speak Americano A daring fusion of the American smooth free-form Jazz tap and the Macarena. After I watched that scene, I retired from creating dance because I realised I didn't understand dance myself. NEIL OLIVER: Even the world's biggest boyband coveted their moves. The Inbetweeners Movie surpassed everyone's wildest expect... Shh! The film's about to start. Well, tell someone who gives a toss! The Inbetweeners Movie surpassed everyone's wildest expectations, becoming a true modern classic. Oh, bollocks, I thought this was Miss Congeniality 2. I love Sandra Bullock. A vehicle full of desirable young women. When young men encounter a muffwagon, their natural instinct is to honk their horn and follow it. Up ahead, a car full of muff! The total number of relationships started by chasing women in a car currently stands at zero. What I've learnt from The Inbetweeners is... ..to never volunteer for a fashion show. MUSIC: Lady Marmalade I just wanted to know whether it was actually his testicle. A teenager's bedroom is their castle. GROANING Are you OK? It's just a film. Can I say I relate to that? It's just a normal film. God, I'm getting changed. Get out! Never go on a caravanning holiday. TOILET FLUSHES Jesus Christ. WEAKLY: My eyes are burning. Never let a French exchange student stay in your house if you have a hot mother. Bonjour. Oh, goodness, you're French. "Your mother is very sexy." I just had a really nice... er, tug thinking about your mother. LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE Welcome back to The Inbetweeners Friends Reunited, the Channel 4 telethon where we attempt to raise money for four of the UK's most disadvantaged loser virgins. Right, we've got a guest. Do you recognize this voice? "Your mother is very sexy. "She has the sex." Yes, that's right, it's Vladimir Consigny, AKA Patrice the French exchange student! Now, you're a proper actual actor. No offence. No, none taken. None taken, it's fine, yeah. But, like, you've gone on to do sort of things in France and, like, proper actual drama. Yes, I have. Yeah. But they are amazing actors, all of them, actually. Vlad, you're so handsome. LAUGHTER I love you. LAUGHTER Have you got a question for the boys? Well, I have a question, yeah, I do, actually. I came to London for the first time, to England for the first time, for shooting The Inbetweeners 10 years ago, and I haven't been back since, so my only vision of England is this. Is the UK only like that? Is it normal here? Are we normal? Yeah. Like, do you think you give a good representation of Britain today? I don't think we give a good representation of humans! I think it gives a fair representation of teenage idiots in Britain, but I like to think we're a bit better than just what you see on The Inbetweeners. But then you never know, we're in a dodgy situation at the moment. Well, let's throw it back at you. Are these boys like teenagers are in France? Oh, look at him. He was knee deep in clunge. LAUGHTER Were you successful in school with the ladies? I don't know, I did OK. What about you? Me? Yeah. Oh, yeah! LAUGHTER This guy? Sure. Sure. No I had to... er, no. No? Weirdly, yeah, no-one got lost in my eyes, because you can barely see them. They're like pissholes in the snow. Everyone, let's hear it for Patrice, the foreign exchange, Vladimir Consigny. Thank you very much. APPLAUSE Right, time for our next award. It's Best Action Sequence, and here to present it, the man, the legend, Frank Bruno. MUSIC: Theme from Rocky APPLAUSE Good to see you, yeah. Thank you very much, it's great. I've enjoyed it. Thank you, thank you. It's Frank Bruno, everyone. FRANK CHUCKLES Cheers, thank you. Did you have a tough time at school? Did you get bullied? Erm... not really, cos I started boxing so I could look after myself and run very fast. Nice. Yeah! Normally when people... I like your suit as well. Thanks very much. Normally, when people come on the show I take the piss a little bit but... eh! Yeah? No. LAUGHTER I'm not... not having it. FRANK CHUCKLES You can take the piss any time you want. cos I admire you, you've got class and I like your suits that you wear. So you can take the piss out of me any time you want. RAPIDLY: Thank you very much, you massive bell-end. Cheers. FRANK CHUCKLES LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE Shall we announce the nominations? Yeah. Go on. The nominations are: It's like riding a bike, innit? HE LAUGHS MUSIC: Lady Marmalade But it's my bowels. They're disabled. Oh, no. Will! Will, poo! Poo! Poo! Clear! Clear! Yeah, you won, yeah! Nooo! Right then, Si. Looks like the holiday starts here. DANCE MUSIC And the winners are... the dancers. CHEERING AND APPLAUSE Just, James, if you could just sit there and do nothing. Hello, there. Hello, sir. Hello. How are you doing? Respect. All right, thank you. How does it feel to win, gentleman? Good, good. This for me is like the result of spending my lonely teenage years watching a lot of Justin Timberlake movie videos, so I'd like to thank all the people that wouldn't be friends with me, and Justin Timberlake. Who probably wouldn't be friends with you as well. Yeah! He'll fit within that group. Can I ask, James, what's it like to lose? To lose to these guys? They... fucking deserve it. LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE A round of applause for our dancers and Frank Bruno. Thank you very much indeed, Frank. Now, Joe, Simon, Blake and James have spent the years since The Inbetweeners ended trying to convince people they're actual proper actors. Let's see how they got on. For someone who doesn't stop going on about Formula One, you're surprisingly shit at driving. Ha-ha! Seriously, like no control of the vehicle. No control of the vehicle? ALARM GOES OFF Why does it keep doing that? No control of the vehicle. Well, you can drive next time. Fine, and you can learn from the master. Master Knobface. I was sitting at my desk... That's strange! No, it's not. And I was on the phone... That's strange! No... it's not. And then there was this flash of light, and before I knew it, I was in another world. That's the strange part. Guys, this is The Pirate. Who calls themselves The Pirate? What, does he have only one leg? He does actually only have one leg, yeah. He was in a really savage car accident when he was five and they had to amputate below the knee. There really is no way I could have known that. I mean, The Rock isn't called The Rock cos his dad was crushed by a boulder. I hate dogs. Well, that's a silly thing to say. It's like a bloody donkey! How's it going to fit in the car? I thought we were going to the hotel? That's a different car. Change of plan. I need to go to Porlock, see a client. OK, well, I'll wait here. You need to come with me! He could be anywhere, the man from Canada. Well, I'm not going without Rinka. Christ, you make it difficult. Get in, then! In, in! Get in the car! APPLAUSE That's your proper acting. So, Blake, you're in A Very English Scandal, which is quite a serious thing. Were you were preparing for that role by just punching fish? Well, obviously, you know, having a history of animal cruelty in shows has probably helped. I don't know what it is about my face that either screams "idiot" or "masochist", but there's something in it. Yeah. Simon, you're directing a movie, right? That's right, yeah. It's hopefully coming out next year. It starts Monica Dolan, Earl Cave, Rob Brydon, Tamsin Greig, Tim Key, lots of other people. I didn't get a phone call. It's weird, isn't it, that I didn't want you guys hanging around, slapping me in the balls and drawing horrid little cartoons of me on the clapper board. Were any of you worried about being typecast on The Inbetweeners? Yeah, I think so, at the time. I've sort of changed my opinion on that recently. Go on, how so? Because that's sort of the best thing I do, and people like me doing it. Yeah, I'm 100% with you. I'm good at one-liners, shit at interviews. Of course one of the most beloved scenes of The Inbetweeners is when you're at the water park and some shit lands on your face. Yeah. How many times did you have to film that sequence? Phew. I lost count, to be honest. Let's take a look. Yay! What? APPLAUSE I mean, my favourite thing about that is that you must have had to call home, "How was your day?" "Not great." "Of course, Blake had the really difficult job, shitting 18 times". I lost a lot of weight on that. OK. Join us after the break when we'll be revealing the winner of the best ever Inbetweeners moment as voted for by you, fans of the show. See you in a minute. APPLAUSE Dead hand gang, collective noun. If one is simply too unattractive to find a sexual partner, one can numb one's own hand to experience the sensation of another's touch. Or, at the very least, the symptoms of late stage diabetes. APPLAUSE Welcome back to The Inbetweeners: Fwends Reunited. It's the final part of the show and we'll be revealing the best Inbetweeners moment ever as voted for by you, fans of the show. But before that, we have the final instalment of our history of The Inbetweeners. After three television series and one hit movie, what was next for The Inbetweeners? Excuse me, can you be quiet, please? Book wanker. Shhh! International versions, that's what was next. The American version of The Inbetweeners had a profound affect on the USA. It aired for the first time in 2012. Just four years later, Donald Trump was elected president. You join the dots. Merchandise followed, and because Iain and Damon hated the idea of selling Inbetweeners tat, the bootleggers were having a field day. I know where the smart money came from in 2011. I made a fortune out of bootleg "bus wanker" phone covers. The success of the first Inbetweeners Movie simply couldn't be topped, so Damon and Iain explicitly stated there would be no more Inbetweeners movies, they would not do anything to tarnish their art. No amount of money would persuade them to sell out. And then three years later, they made The Inbetweeners 2. Will! Will, I need help! That last one, I think maybe I followed through. Go. RAUCOUS LAUGHTER It's my bowels, they're disabled. Oh, no. Will! Will, poo! Poo! I mean, that water slide scene, it is just perfection. It's got everything. It's got the wild thrill of the car chases from Baby Driver. Oh, no! But instead of cars, it's a poo. It's got the edge of your seat tension of Spielberg's Jaws. Out of the water! Clear! But instead of a shark, it's a poo. Yay! You won! Yeah. I mean, it really is the greatest poo-based water chute scene in cinema history. No-o-o! Sadly, that's the end of the historical account. It's only a day's work, which is a shame really, because talking about stuff that's already happened is a piss easy gig, but enough about me, what was next for The Inbetweeners? Nothing. That's it. It's finished. But while The Inbetweeners has come to an end, its impact is still resonating, not just culturally, but socially, in the villages, towns and cities of this great nation. Goodnight. Bus wankers! Right. Time now to reveal the winner of the best Inbetweeners moment ever as voted for by you, the Great British public, or Russian bots, who knows? From a list of the top 12 best moments ever, you overwhelmingly voted for the following four clips. Here to introduce the favourites, I'm not saying my next guest likes her men young, but her vagina recently failed its CRB check, it's Katherine Ryan. CHEERING I always get so excited when he asks me to come on a show and it turns out to really be a show and not a trap. Well, and I'm glad you got the message about the uniform I wanted you to wear. Thank you. I struggled to find the exact tie. You've performed with four teenage boys before but I don't believe it was televised. It's all right, it's just a bit of fun. Were you any good at school? Well, you know the game plan in Canada is just get fingered by anyone who owns ice skates and hope that one of them gets drafted to the NHL. Some nominations. OK. The nominations for the best Inbetweeners moment ever are... Best Moment Ever. MUSIC: "We No Speak Americano" by Yolanda Be Cool and Dcup Well, that was a much more dignified end for him. I have to stop. Aye, aye! No! Jay! Bus wankers! Why are you slowing down? I tried to say! Oh, Christ, Jay! Oh, shit! Oh, no, they're coming. Shit! Drive! Where? Where am I meant to drive to? Anywhere! Oh, shit! Listen, sorry. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. Who's a wanker? I'm sorry. I'm a wanker, am I? I'm really sorry. He's really sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Sorry. I'd rather be a bus wanker than drive that piece of... Oh, fucking hell, you two shit yourselves! Enough of your lip. Oh, you'd like my lip, wouldn't you? Right round your bell-end! If Mr Chippy doesn't get there first. What's he going to knock up, a closet for you hide in? You bumder! Katherine Ryan, the best ever Inbetweeners moment. Oh, my goodness. And the winner, with 21.5% of the votes, is.... ..bus wankers! CHEERING James, Joe, Simon, Blake, come over and get your trophy. Give them a round of applause. Yeah, it's good. Nice, weren't it? They were all good moments, weren't they really, when you think back? It was a good show, wasn't it? Would you do a third movie? Yeah, of course I would. LAUGHTER AND CHEERING There you go. Well, that's almost all we've got time for. A huge thank you to Simon, Blake, James and Joe, the supporting cast and to all The Inbetweeners fans. Take it away.
