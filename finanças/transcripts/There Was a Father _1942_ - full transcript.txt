I'll buy some today my shoes are worn out. I'll never get them to shine they'll do for now but they're split you can still wear them you haven't forgotten anything, have you? Right, then. You've left nothing? Ethics, mathematics, history, reading, craft - oh, I forgot my abacus - You see? Smarten yourself up - the area of a circle? - The square of its radius x 3.14 a cone's volume? The square of its radius x 3.14 x the height and divided by 3 - good All right, the quadrangle aedc is inscribed in a circle And the angles aec and abc are equal to this angle and this angle - all right. Kato? - Above the line ac yes, the angles formed above line ac are equal the triangle adc is an isosceles triangle therefore, this angle and that angle are equal that means aec and def are also equal, right? Understand? Any questions? Right, that's all for today. Now, about the school excursion... Quieten down, quieten down this class will be going to Tokyo first we'll visit the imperial palace in Tokyo then we'll visit meiji shrine and yasukuni shrine finally, on to kamakura, enoshima and hakone Ready? Everybody look this way here we go Hakone fass, the steepest in all of Japan even the kankoku barrier doesn't compare the highest mountains and the deepest valleys tower before us and hold us up from behind mountains circled by clouas, valleys cloaked in mist the rows of ceoars are gark even auring the aay the winding path [s soff with moss if fakes only one man [0 protect it from an army stalwart warriors travelling the land swords at their hips and clogs on their feet stomping along elght miles of boulders such were the warriors of old It's a stalemate with that move - your blisters are huge - Do they hurt? - Want me to burst them? - No come on - I said no! How are the blisters, Yamada? All right, sir - can you walk? - I'll be fine, sir - try rubbing soap on your socks - Yes, sir Aren't they our students? They can't be. I warned them not to go on the lake did anybody go out on the lake? Do you know anybody out in the boats? No, sir - kinoshita? - I don't know, sir - what about you, sato? - I don't know, sir right? - How much? - 50 sen 50 sen? Not bad. I wish I'd bought one - you can have it for 80 sen - 80 sen? No way! - Sir! - Mr. horikawa! - What is it? - Yoshida's boat has capsized! Yoshida's in a boat? A telegram for you, sir His family are coming on the night train I understand how you feel. But I'd like you to reconsider will you? I understand that you consider yourself responsible... Out you did your best as a leader the boy's family knows that I warned them it was dangerous... But if I'd been more strict with them, they wouldn't have got in the boats they would've obeyed me I've had these children for 3 years but I became careless yoshida wasn't a disobedient kid. But I've failed in my duty as a teacher I was negligent I think you're taking too much responsibility I thank you for your concern... Obut I've thought it over and made my decision I realise that, but... I've tendered my resignation to the headmaster - you can rescind it - Listen, hirata... Let me do it this way the responsibility of taking care of other people's children frightens me I'll never forget yoshida's parents I have a son, I can imagine how they feel it's unbearable suddenly losing a child you've raised for so long he leaves on a fun trip and returns cold as stone it's an unendurable sorrow, one beyond mere tears he'd even bought his mother a souvenir from the trip to hakone I'd despise such a teacher... And never again leave him in charge of children this job scares me now it frightens me I'm not suited for it And what will you do about your own son, ryohei? I'm thinking of returning to my home town I have an old friend there I'll stay there and think things over I'm home! Hello, sir Is it far to ueda, father? Another 40 minutes. Are you tired? No. Is ueda a big town? Of course, it's a city what's the population? Around 35,000 it's famous for its orchid market and its silk industry school, isn't it? That's right you forgot to cut your nails? You should keep your nails cut and clean at all times Were you born in that house? - Is it still yours? - No, not any more remember we visited your grandfather's grave and your mother's grave? Your grandfather sold that house to put me through school was grandfather a kimono dealer? No. He was a teacher of the Chinese classics. He worked at the castle each day The house used to have a big persimmon tree at the back let's go later on to see the castle yes, let's do that chew it well Ueda is quite a small town, isn't it? I imagined it'd be bigger well, kanazawa's much bigger. It's the largest on the sea of Japan coast - don't you like this town? - Why? I'm thinking of settling here you mean we'll move here? Will you teach here? No, I'm not teaching any more I've been trying to tell you... I'll never teach again - what will you do, then? - 1 don't know I have this priest friend here, I'll live in his temple - will you become a priest? - No, priests are much more virtuous don't be upset you'll have to attend school here all right? Be brave schools are all the same, you'll soon make new friends okay? It'll be fine you were nicknamed 'badger, weren't you? I was always 'little badger". I hated it - the people here don't know that - No, they don't - How's work going at the town hall? - Fine, thanks for such a small place, they have big families - I registered three births yesterday - Really? And the infant mortality rate is low I should have been a midwife Where's ryohei? He went catching dragonflies with a friend so he's making friends? - No, he prefers killing creatures - Well, children should be active It's a beautiful Sunday You finished? Then you can't go to the river tomorrow it's the same as the problem last night you're still stuck it's proportional division. I explained it last night a, b and c set out a will take 12 days, b will take 15 oh, right wrong again just settle down and focus you'll never get into a good school that way you're not focused enough you'll never amount to anything if you don't get into high school study hard and I'll send you not only to a good school... But to a school of your choice just relax and concentrate done it! It's easy if you concentrate, right? That's good. Easy, wasn't it? Get the fishing tackle Check the line for any tangles - is this all right? - Yes we'll get some worms early tomorrow - there are loads under the fig tree - Really? I hope you both catch plenty of fish tomorrow I gave them their last rites a long time ago... Obut the fish in these parts can be quite crafty You must be happy now your exams are over - what about that other lad? - Who? What's his name? The soy sauce merchant's son oh, toshi? He passed he did? That's good I don't know how I did it, though. I couldn't do question 4 well, just one doesn't matter listen, ryonhel... When you go to school, you'll have to live in the dormitory the dormitory? It's too far to commute every day me? Alone in ueda? I'll come and visit you once a week come on, you'll get used to it listen, it'll be the summer holidays soon... And you can come home then Does 'hen' mean a female chicken? And 'cockerel' means the male? - What's 'dog' then? - Inu - is it male or female? - No idea english is so difficult - aren't you starving? - Yeah - what's that yellow stuff with rice? - Rice with curry? - Yeah, it tastes so good - Good but hot horikawa... What are you doing here, father? Well, I happened to be in town can you get permission to come out? He'll probably give you some pocket money no, he already gave me 50 sen last Sunday buy us something, then - okay is your dad here? Lucky you - let's give his father a nickname - Like what? - How about 'badger? - Yes, that's good everybody has to help with the weeding - again? - They grow so fast This is really tasty. Have some I'm supposed to be weeding with the other boys - I feel sorry for them - That's all right we'll buy them some sweets - no, thanks - You've had enough? I'm stuffed - They have rice with curry, don't they? - Want some? Too late now - don't lie down after you eat - Don't worry - there's only 53 more days to go - Till the summer holidays? Father, can we go fishing in that river? Course we can we could drain the pond and catch loads in the summer holidays, we can go every day well, I'm afraid not, son - I came to tell you, ryohei... - What? I've decided to move to Tokyo Tokyo? Great! When? But you're staying here, you have your studies I've thought it over, and I'm going to try to find work in Tokyo I can't make enough money here... To send you to good schools so, I need to work harder I think you're mature enough now to understand what I'm saying I'll go to work in Tokyo, and you'll continue your studies here it'll be like having a contest between us you mustn't let me win, okay? I'm still young enough to give you a run for your money you mustn't get lazy there's no need to cry. It's nothing to be sad about we're not saying goodbye forever I'll be waiting for you to come and visit me in Tokyo we'll soon be back together again. Understand? You understand? Now, stop your crying I won't be seeing you for a while, so I've brought you some things shirts, pants, tissue paper, and three pairs of socks wear the socks in turn and wash them occasionally These are cold remedies... And these are for if you get stomach aches, all right? And don't drink any unboiled water even when it gets warmer don't catch a chill while you're sleeping and keep your stomach and chest warm at night here's some spending money Don't waste it spend it wisely I'll write as soon as I get to Tokyo... And you write a letter to me every week we'll correspond by mail like we do now, all right? Understand? There are some stamps in here Stop crying now it's nearly time for you to go back what time did your teacher say to return? - 7 o'clock - Well, we still have some time You have to work hard - Yes, sir? - Another one of these, please hey, do you want curry and rice? Just sake then Hey, ryohel, come here It's unbecoming for a man to cry. Men shouldn't cry I hear your son graduated from school? - Which university will he attend? - Sendai city I thought we'd live together in Tokyo, but it's not worked out that way... I see. But it must be exciting, all the same still, as long as he works hard at his studies Fxcuse me a moment Mr. hirata fxcuse me - well, well! - It zs you. It's been a long time how strange, bumping into you here I thought it might be you... But I never imagined you'd be in Tokyo what an odd place to run into you. Have you been in Tokyo long? Yes. Do you often come here? Is that so”? I've been coming here a lot since last Autumn - it's strange we didn't meet sooner - Isn't it? - I'm glad you're well - Good to see you the last time I saw you was at that temple in ueda that must be 12-13 years ago such a long time when I first came here, I was a total stranger but as the days passed, I just got busier I haven't kept in touch with any of the others, though I meant to we're both guilty of that - A little something for you - Please don't go to any trouble - there's none left? - There was... Fine please. You've grown. I can hardly recognise you now you've grown into a very beautiful girl how old are you? Twenty-one she only looks grown up here. She's very beautiful seiichi... Come and say hello to our guest - don't want to! - Seiichi! I said no! He's such a handful at least he's got plenty of spirit that's very naughty, seiichi you silly boy - what's that? - I want money for films no way! Not until you greet our guest properly - come on, sis! - No way you're working at the town hall? I'm compiling material on the history of Tokyo here. It's not a bad job for a washed-up old teacher like me hello there what are you up to? I'm going to see a film what a rascal! How's your ryohei? He's fine, thank you he graduated from tohoku imperial university this year he's 25 now already 257 and what's he doing for a living? He's teaching at an industrial college in akita that sounds good fate is strange. I myself gave up teaching... And I never thought I'd let him enter the profession I guess it's a case of 'like father, like son' it's a good thing, I envy you but you must be lonely living alone no, I've grown used to it we've been apart for such a long time I thought this year we'd be together, but it's not worked out like that you're still in good health. There'll be plenty of chances to live together I hope so - I mean it ryohei's grown into a fine young man. I envy you I still have all that to come with my kids! They'll always be children in our eyes I just hope he's doing all right for himself When you mix nitrate toluene three times with nitric and sulphuric acids... You get trinitrotoluene, or tnt see the three nitrogen dioxide particles here? The solid is yellow in colour it melts at 81 degrees celsius, and it combusts if heated to 295 degrees when it combusts... Two molecules of tnt decompose to three of nitrogen... Five of water, seven of carbon monoxide... And seven carbon atoms its use as an explosive derives from the energy released A steam train... Wish it was taking me home I could get home on that train if my home were a little closer, I could commute to school it's a long train makes me want to go home - who's the dormitory master today? - Mr. horikawa - you think he'll allow us? - You went home just last Saturday but my baby brother's just been born Permission to enter, sir - Sir! - What is it? I'm requesting permission to go home, sir But you've just recently been home yes, sir, but we just had a new baby, so I'd like to go back again with a new baby brother, there'll be no mother's milk for you, you know? I know that, sir how old is your father, then? You shouldn't forget your father's age your elder brother was drafted, wasn't he? - How's he doing? - Fine, sir how are your parents managing? Not too well. But the neighbours help out a lot well, I'm glad to hear that your duty is to study hard don't cause your parents any worry all right... Permission to leave, sir Permission to enter, sir what is it? We're planning to go to mt akiba next Sunday. Will you join us, sir? I can't make next Sunday - can't you, sir? - You sure, sir? - I'm busy - Please, sir, won't you reconsider? Sorry, but I'm going to see my father - I see - You still miss your father, sir? Of course, I still do. And I always will is that so? - That's that, then - Guess it is permission to leave, sir - perhaps another time - We hope so, sir Ah, that feels good it does, doesn't it? Thanks for coming this far not at all. The train wasn't crowded - the water here is beautifully scented - Tis I haven't been in these parts for a long time you've put on weight - have I? Being the dormitory supervisor suits me perfectly I get up early in the mornings and do exercise it does you good to have regular habits - how are you, father? - Excellent. Never had a day off sick really? You've more meat on you than I have - shall I wash your back? - That's all right I'll wash yours - no, I'm fine I haven't been here for such a long time I came here once before, when I was at utsunomiya high school your mother was still alive then - I don't think you were even born - Really? So Mr. hirata's well, too? He's still quite active. We often play go together - do you? - He's a better player, too I'd like to see him again - remember his daughter, fumiko? - I'm not sure she used to be a slip of a girl this tall I remember, a little girl in a yellow sash well, she's grown into a real beauty now really? She used to be such a cry-baby was she? I've drunk a lot tonight. It feels good you can hold your drink, can't you? Not at all I couldn't drink this much every night... But this is a special occasion - Oh, do you smoke? - A little I'll just have the one - When did you first start? - I don't smoke that often good. Best not to, they'll send you stupid is that right? Listen, father... I've given it some thought, and I've decided to give up my job - why? - To move to Tokyo why? Are you unhappy in your job? No, it's not that it's just that with me working up north... Who knows when I'll be able to move to Tokyo? Ever since school, 've always wanted us to live together I thought we could do so after I graduated, but I ended up in akita I hate living apart from you like this I appreciate how much you sacrificed for my education... And I shouldn't be selfish... Out I want to work in Tokyo and be with you what do you think? There are jobs available in Tokyo no, out of the question I would like to live with you too... But we both have our jobs no matter what your job is, it's your calling in life we all must do our duty... And we must do it to the best of our ability there's no room for personal feelings do your best, work all you can... And you'll maintain your position in the world sometimes work can be tedious... 'Lasting happiness only comes about from the alternation of pleasure and pain' work isn't worthwhile if it isn't hard you'll only be happy if you see it through stop being selfish. Let go of the self you can't do your job with such a nonchalant attitude... Especially in a profession as important as yours the parents of those boys have made great sacrifices... To send their boys to your school shaping their characters should be your prime concern your every action is an example to them... And that responsibility is not to be taken lightly I failed in my responsibility, so you must succeed you must do your duty for both of us. I want you to give it your all we can occasionally meet like this isn't that enough? Isn't life better when we're both working as hard as we can? Isn't it? Isn't that enough? You understand do the best you can It's a pity, though I wish we'd had more time to fish we should have gone fishing yesterday evening time flies as soon as we meet, we have to part we waited a long time for this chance but at least we had a night to talk I really enjoyed it when's your train? - Not for a while - We'll meet again soon anyway look after yourself and don't get sick at a time like this, we all must do our part I will take good care Father... Do you need some spending money? Spending money? For me? It's not much, but please take it I wasn't sure, it's such a small sum - well, I'd be honoured to accept it - Please do thank you I'll offer it at your mother's altar when I get back thank you Father, I'm sorry about last night I was being selfish I was perhaps a little too abrupt, but I'm glad you understand please do your best there is no time for idleness now I'm still capable, so I'll work hard too I et's both do our best yes, let's do that don't forget anything The nightingales are singing Some visitors for you, sir Mr. kurokawa? To see me? Send them in It's been a long time, sir I'm yasutaro kurokawa. You taught me at kanazawa high school is that right? And I'm minoru uchida well, well. Have a seat - you're looking well, sir - Thank you you're looking well yourselves. Do sit down thank you, sir it's been a while I ran into Mr. hirata yesterday and he told me about you, sir oh, is that right? - He told us all about you, sir - Did he now? About you both playing go together he was my go partner back in our teaching days then we ran into each other in Tokyo and started playing again - I bet you're a good player, sir - No, far from it there are a number of our old schoolmates here in Tokyo... And we're planning a party in honour of you and Mr. hirata we can all talk about the old days we'd be honoured if you could attend, sir that's very kind of you what day would be convenient, sir? Mr. hirata said any day was fine by him me too. I'd be glad to come really? Well, then, the sooner the better how about this Saturday or next Wednesday? Let's see, which day would suit you, sir? Well, next Wednesday would be best for me. Is that possible? That's best for you? You see, my son's coming to visit me this Saturday your son? I heard he's up in akita is that ryohei? He must be all grown up by now - how old is he? - He's 25 Welcome - I've just got back master ryohel is here, sir really? Welcome home - when did you arrive? - About an hour ago you're earlier than I expected. I thought it'd be tomorrow or the day after are you planning to stop over in ueda? Yes, the priest offered to let me stay why didn't you stay? Well, I wanted to come as soon as possible I see. And how is he? He's very well. He gave me some cigarettes for you - that's nice of him - He's still fond of his tea and you passed the physical for the draft? Well, that's good go and tell your mother I'm so relieved you were a sickly child... But I'm glad you've grown out of it you've grown into a strong young man - how long can you stay? - I have 10 days off well, that's long enough for us to enjoy ourselves you look younger than before do I? - You still have it - My bald patch? - You remember? - I fell off the porch - will you take a bath? - You go first are you sure? Very well I'll have one later Please get out a cotton kimono for ryohei we'll have dinner after our baths Mr. hirata, do you still remember... How you punished Iwamoto and me for fighting in year 3? - Did I? - Yes. Isn't that right? That was an awful day you made us stand outside the staff room, and then forgot to dismiss us did I? I'm awfully sorry Mr. horikawa, sir, you used to scold me a lot too that's right, you were always dozing off in class now he's famous for dozing off at work - oh, dear - You should give him a talking-to, sir - he'll never change, sir - Give me a break I'd like to say a few words we're very grateful that both of you could spare your valuable time we greatly appreciate it. Thank you more than 10 years have passed since our graduation... And nothing could give us greater pleasure... Than sharing this evening together with you we'd like to take this opportunity... [O ask that you continue to offer us your guidance please eat and drink to your heart's content let's enjoy ourselves like we did in the old days I'd like to add something two more old boys were expected this evening... But sasaki was called away on business to Kobe he's sent the following telegram, however, which I'll read for you now 'pleased to hear you're both in good health 'hope the reunion is a success and nakanishi called to announce... The birth of his baby boy earlier this evening mother and child are fine he said he'll try to make it later on well, that's wonderful news! Cheers! It was very kind of you to organise this wonderful reunion we are deeply grateful to you it makes us very happy to see you all as healthy and active as ever all those years ago you nicknamed me 'the badger but the badger is old now and now it's time for me to ask you for your help and guidance I sincerely hope that all of you enjoy good health... Push yourselves to the fullest... And be successful in your chosen professions I express my heartfelt gratitude to each and every one of you Mr. horikawa has said everything I intended to say not only 'the badger' but I, 'the chicken'... Also ask for your favour It's been such a long time, sir. I didn't expect to see you in Tokyo - another drink, sir? - Thank you you've grown into a fine young man. Are you married yet? Yes, indeed most of us are is that so? Everybody, raise your hands if you're married - We're the only bachelors here! - It appears so and those with children, raise your hands congratulations those with two children? Anyone with three? - It's a little soon to have three - Indeed it is just a moment! I have four congratulations isn't it amazing, Mr. horikawa, how time flies? Most of them have children already time certainly does fly one more, sir? - And for you, sir? - No, thank you, I've had my fill just one more - life's so unpredictable, isn't it? - It certainly is it's been over 10 years since you gave up teaching over that accident... And now, here you are enjoying this reunion quite so do you still make offerings at yoshida's grave every year? Someone told me that when I went back home I do what I can, out of a sense of remorse but making such offerings isn't easy I can still picture you all as students, just as you were back then I know what you mean. Strange, isn't it? When I resigned my position and returned home, Mr. hirata... You held a party for me yes, I remember I often recall that night the primroses were in full bloom all along the river yes, they were I was deeply moved... By the Chinese poem you recited - do you recite poetry, sir? - Yes, and very well, too - we'd like to hear some - Please, sir yes, please, sir listen, everybody If you insist... - Welcome home, sir - Sorry it's so late - welcome back - You're still up, then? - 50, how was the party? - I thoroughly enjoyed it that's good my old pupils have grown into fine young men is that right? I'm just grateful that they still remember me... Even though I wasn't a very good teacher they were extremely kind and thought of everything did they? It was a very nice evening were there many there? Yes. And they were all very pleased to hear news of you too really? You must work as hard as they do We should endeavour to do our best in everything we do What do you think of Mr. hirata's daughter? What do you mean? What would you say to marrying her? I'm still too young I think fumiko's a lovely girl Mr. hirata was the one who brought it up in conversation don't be so shy you can read that book later what do you think? Or is there someone else? No Then marry her you passed your army physical with flying colours... And the single life is hard in the countryside well? I'd marry her if I were you all right, 'll leave it your hands, father you will? She'll make a good, hard-working wife she's the type 've always wanted for you now I feel relieved and very drunk would you get me some water? Oh, I feel wonderful Are you off anywhere today? - I'm going to buy a book - Again? Yes. I need a certain chemistry text I found one last time, but it was falling apart I'm going to look for a better copy today you should visit the museum in ueno as well. They have a fine collection really? Where else can you see so many beautiful things for 10 sen? There's an exhibition of paintings by kazan watanabe really? You should see them when you see his paintings, you'll understand... The profound beauty of traditional Japanese art I'll go and see them I'm bringing Mr. hirata over tonight... 50 try to be home for that, all right? Master, there's something wrong with your father Father, what's wrong? What happened? I feel a little pain, here are you all right? Father? I'm fine Father, why don't you take the day off? No, I'm fine I've never missed a day of work in my life Father. Father! Quickly, call the doctor! Father! Father! Help me get these clothes off I feel strange father! Father! Father... Can you hear me? Mr. hirata's here Kind of you to come Mr. horikawa. Please try to hold on thank you fumiko... Look after ryohei for me That's my wish father... I feel good I feel sleepy... Very sleepy father... Be strong it's nothing to be sad about I did the very best I could I'm happy... Father! Time of death: 3:16 there's nothing more I can do Ryohel, please don't cry your father died with great dignity only people who do their utmost while alive... Can die with such dignity Mr. horikawa was a great man you were lucky to have him as a father please, don't cry I wonder if seiichi is asleep by now? I bet he misses you terribly and your father will be helpless without you Perhaps we could ask them to come and live with us in akita? It'd be good, us all living together yes, I think so, t00 I always wanted to live with my father, ever since I was little unfortunately he died before we could live together but it's all right. At least we had a week together that was the best week of my life He was such a good father
