Help! Somebody, please! Oh. Oh, god. My phone. Where's my... 911, what's your emergency? I've been shot in the leg. I need help. Oh, jesus. Please hurry. Okay, I need you to tell me your location so I can send help. Big lake park. End of the... End of the walkway on the train side. Oh! Is the assailant still nearby? No! She took off running. Stay with me, an ambulance is on the way. hey, liz. What are you doing? Are you crazy? Isn't that what you love about me? how do you know how to get up here? I cocktail waitressed here part-time many years ago. Very short-lived. It's freezing. Aren't you cold? I don't have to be. don't stop. I'm too damn old to be doing the walk of shame. Well, you certainly wear it well. You hungry? No. Alright. you know, it might be nice if I had my own drawer here. Liz. Dave! Please. I'm just asking for a place to put a clean pair of jeans, not an engagement ring. We talked about this. Four months ago. Things have been going pretty well since then, don't you think? Yes. So? You want to maybe try the exclusivity thing for a while? You know what? Never mind. Hey, hey. You know that I just got out of a 12-year relationship. Oh, my god. Whatever. As always, I bring something up and dave runs for the hills. You're the only one who has a problem here. I don't want to hurt you, so maybe we should just not even do this. No, no, no. No. It's fine. Honestly. It's just... my two of hearts membership is expiring in a couple of days. I wasn't sure if I should turn down the brad pitt lookalike who recently messaged me or renew it, so now I know. dave was very young when he first got together with sarah. Didn't have a chance to sow his wild oats. Whatever. I am dating several people, too. Oh, well, the point is you don't want to. - No, I don't. - Uh-huh. It wouldn't be so hard if I didn't really like him a lot, and... The sex is phenomenal, and she's fun to hang out with, but I don't really see it being anything more than that. Hey, can you bring me an extension? Yeah. Liz is cool with you dating other women? Not really. She'd like it to be more serious, but, you know, I like to keep my options open. Yeah, I get it. Maybe meet someone the old-fashioned way. Go for it, don juan. Hey, there. Hi. That does not sound good. No, and the timing couldn't be worse. Do you have a minute right now to look at it? You're in luck. Oh, wow. Such service. Who said chivalry's dead? Let's pop this open. Oh, thank you. Okay. Oh, yeah. Alright, you see those? - Yeah. Mm-hm. - Yeah. See, they collapse when there's not enough of an oil cushion to dampen the pounding from the, um... The camshaft. almost. the tappet. Um, yeah, I was trying to impress you, and clearly I know just enough to get myself into trouble. Well, I'm still impressed. Um, I'm late for work. Uh... Do you know how long this would take? Uh, have it by 1:00? Great. And if you're going to be at work, then is somebody else coming to pick this up, or? Oh, you mean like a husband or boyfriend? You could just ask me. No, no. I was just asking, because I'm going to need - to just give the car... - No, it's... It's, um, just me. Here you go. Okay. And I will see you later. At 1:00. Yes. Dave. Yup. That's me. See you at 1:00. so, did you get her phone number? Nah, I didn't even get her name. She's, like, she's a customer. It's unprofessional. Bro, that's exactly how you meet someone the old-fashioned way. I, uh, forgot my computer. uh, hey. I was... - I was wondering... - I also wanted... Maybe you'd want to go get a drink sometime. Yeah, that sounds, um... That sounds really nice. Bye. Hey, mom. We're here. Uh, we're in the kitchen, hon. Hey, what up, cuz? Oh, just hanging with the ladies. Yeah, like I had a choice. Happy wife. Happy life. hey, there's some lasagna in the oven, if you're hungry, sam. When am I not, grandma? These are such cute wedding favors. See? Better than his and her shot glasses. Yes. Hey, nice touchdown last night. Did you hear us screaming in the stands? I've scored the most points this season so far. Aww, that is so good! I'm so proud. Don't get cocky, right? Even a blind squirrel finds a nut now and again. Okay, I will pick you up in the morning. have fun. I'm happy you're getting out there again. Mom, please. How's your dad doing? Oh, you know him. He's tough and he doesn't complain, but, um, I think treatments have been rough this round, so. - Oh. - Yeah. Uh, love you guys. Bye. - Bye. - See ya! so, you knit scarves while you watch scary movies. well, I weirdly love them, but they freak me out, so knitting calms my nerves. okay. Scarves, zombies, running marathons, and what else do you do when you're not computer programming? Uh, I raise my son. Oh. When he lets me. We're really close, but he's almost 16 now. - Yeah. - So. Hm. He's got his dad's hair. He's not in the picture, his dad. I... That's embarrassing. We broke up a long time ago. Actually, right around the time we found out I was pregnant. We tried to stay together, but it didn't work out. That's rough. Daddy! He wasn't ideal. Oh, that takes care of me asking if you have kids. Two actually. Hey, guys. hey. I'm emily. Oh! Guys, come on, let's leave daddy and his friend alone, okay? - Why? - No! Go. Now. See you guys. Oh, right. Sara, this is cari. Hi. So sorry they interrupted like that. Oh, it's totally okay. It's really okay, yeah. Anyways, I was just picking up some take-out, so. It was really nice to meet you, cari. You, too. Have fun. bye. yeah, that is not how I planned on this going. It's okay. I mean, it definitely made it memorable. Maybe I can get a do-over sometime? Well, it's still early. Alright, here we are. Oh. nice place. Yeah, right? when sara and I split up I didn't have a lot of money for furniture, so. Well, it's bringing me back to my college days, and who doesn't love that time in their life? Yeah. um, I got a bordeaux. just hold on. yeah? Dave, I've been trying to reach you. What is it? I lost my keys. I've looked everywhere. I can't get into my place, which is why I was texting you... I have a spare set. I'll be right down. I'm just... I'm going to go. No, no, no. You sh... no, no. This will not take long. You should stay. It's getting late. have a good night. Thank you. So sorry about this. Yeah, it's, um... Fine. Your date just got cut short, and I just left the worst date ever. You wanna have a quick drink? You know, I actually am pretty beat, so I think I'm just going to call it a night. Rain check. You're a life saver. See you soon. That was fast. Come on in. Thanks for, uh... Thanks for being so cool about everything. Honestly, that was nothing. The last guy I dated, um, he ran into me one night when I was out for dinner with a co-worker sushi dayo, and he thought we were together, and he lost his mind. Almost got physical. sounds like a nightmare. Yeah, I was mortified. But we're all old enough that we've accumulated some baggage, so I get it. if you don't mind me being brutally honest, before we were interrupted, I was actually working up the nerve to kiss you. Oh, really? Mm-hm. Um... If we're going to do this, I just need you to know that that's all it is. Nothing more. What? Uh, that... I'm cool with that. I'm into casual. Great. Latte, whole milk? Jesus, you scared the hell out of me. How'd you get in here? I didn't realize you were so jumpy. Your door was unlocked. Well, thanks for this. It's the least you can do after the punishment you're about to put me through. I think you're going to do so well. Oh. That's cute. That's how you run, right? Yeah. Let's go. I have a right to kill in self-defense. That's what the law says, doesn't it, warden? I don't know about this movie. What? You picked it. Yeah, now I don't know about it. whoa, what the hell? I don't know. jesus. James? What are you doing here? Are you frickin' kidding me with this? I'm gone a month. I come back home to a restraining order? What did you expect after last time? Do you have any idea how this affects me? How this looks on my record? And you think violating it is going to make it better? Hey, hey. Is everything alright here? You need to get this lifted. Leave right now before I call the police. Just calm down, buddy. I'm not your buddy, asshole. You're going to regret this. I'm guessing that was sushi dayo guy? Yeah, um, I'm so sorry. I feel terrible. No, don't, but definitely call the police and do not stay here tonight. Well, where am I supposed to go at this hour? Just crash at my place. No, I... Pack... just pack a bag and stay for a couple days. I don't know. Look, I have my big work presentation and I don't... Even better, you'll save time on the commute. So... so, great. Are you sure? I mean, I actually could use the extra time to work on the project, and I think sam can just stay with my mom. Okay, great. Okay. Good morning. Hi. I didn't wake you up, did I? No, no. I always wake up at the same time. Mm. Any big plans for your day off? Yeah, deep cleaning. Can't have a lady of your standing living in this squalor. Well, this lady better get to work. Mm. Do you want me to pick up dinner? No, no. I'll get it. How does italian sound? It's perfect. See you later. Yeah, have a nice day. Thank you. Whiskey, marbles. Enough! Uh, here's your ipad. Oh, my god. Thank you so much. Half my life is on that thing. I'm so glad... Okay. Here it is. Marbles! I'm so glad to have it back. Hey, could I get your help with my window really quick? Look, I gotta go. Please? It's getting warm at night and it's stuck. I can't get it open. Okay. it's totally warped. It's junk. You should call your landlord. Hey! Hey. Mm. That italian smells good. Um... We need to talk. what's wrong? You remember liz, who interrupted our first date? Yeah. I remember. Alright, well, I had to drop something off at her house today and... One thing led to another, and we... I mean, I didn't go over there with... I really was just dropping off her ipad, but, um, then she needed me to help her fix her window. Uh-huh. Um... thanks for being honest. I understand if you're mad. We agreed we weren't going to be exclusive. So, I'm not mad. But I'm famished. So, let's eat. everything okay? Um... No, it's cari. This doesn't make any sense. She wants to move in together. That was fast. It's bizarre. I mean, we said we want to take things slow. This is coming out of nowhere. Oh, except... Except what? I slept with liz, and I told cari, but we said that we could see other people. Nice work, cowboy. You know what, man? She's just reacting to that. Agreement or not, give her time. She'll calm down. now, come on, man. We got two more transmissions to get to today. Okay. the heck? Hey, you gotta read this. "have fun knowing you ruined my life, asshole?" Cari? hello? Oh, hi. No, I haven't. I haven't heard from her, but she's supposed to pick up sam after work today, so... You're kidding me. Alright, I'll let you know. how you feeling, grandpa? - Hi, dennis. - Hey. Did mom call? No, but maybe she got stuck in traffic. We have to start, guys. Yeah. Something's not right, grandma. Mom wouldn't miss this. we haven't seen cari in five days. She's very close with her son and with me. We've never gone this long without talking. Something's wrong. You haven't heard from her at all? Just text messages. Look, I know what you're thinking, but she missed her cousin's wedding. She would never miss something like that if she could help it, and she's taken her father to every single chemo treatment. My daughter, cari... She is a wonderful person. She really is, but yesterday she didn't show up. She didn't call, she didn't text. Nothing. Has she ever disappeared like this before? Um... Yes, about 10 years ago. She was gone for four days. Um, I had her son, I didn't know where she was. She said she'd been feeling off. So, she went to a doctor, and she was diagnosed with anxiety and... And bipolar disorder. But she has been taking her meds ever since. She's never done anything like this again. Is it possible that she's gone off her meds? No! No. I am telling you, something has happened. Can you tell us about cari's romantic life? She has a new boyfriend. His name is dave. Do you have a number? Uh, no, but his last name is kroupa. Dave kroupa. Alright. Thank you for coming in. No, wait! Wait, before dave, cari had a really bad breakup. And the guy, his name was james medina, he just couldn't let the relationship go, and she had to get a restraining order. And there was another guy, um, from her past, not long ago, who's really odd. He... They just went on a few dates, and one night he followed her home, and he almost ran her off the road. You know his name? Toby. Uh, he had two... Two first names. Toby daniel. Okay. We're going to look into this for you, mrs. Raney. Thank you. come on, kids. Alright. In you go. seat belts, please. Oh, my god. what the hell is your problem? I'll tell you what my problem is! Oh. No, no, no. I'm sorry. I thought that... Guess what I found on my garage, dave. I'm so sorry. My kids saw this, dave. My landlord is going to freak. Who would do this? Cari's missing? Know anything about that? No, I haven't seen her in months. How long were you dating? It was brief. She's the one who ended it? Yeah. Because? I don't know. You'd have to ask her. Oh, but I guess you can't, can you? Could it be that you tried to run her off the road? Is that what she said? No, no. Look. I was protecting her. By tailing her? No, by following her home to make sure she got home safely. She almost got into an accident. Well, I don't know, maybe she swerved to avoid hitting a cat. Look, we were drinking. We both drove separately. So, I followed her home to make sure she got home safely, then I continued on to my place, which is four blocks past hers. Look, is that all? 'cause I gotta get back to work. Go. Thanks. So, I'm going to take you to your practice at 3:00 and then we're going to have dinner with jacob and hillary, and I thought maybe you could help me make the spaghetti sauce? I have geometry homework. Okay. Maybe next time. is... Is that mom? what? Did she ever mention to you anything about a job in kansas? Maybe, yeah, like, a month ago, but then she got a raise and she decided that she was going to stay here. Why? Because she says she's moving to wichita for some new job and that she sold all of your furniture. No! Wh... wait, this is... She's just texted me a picture of a check. She wants me to let the buyer into your house so they can take away everything. Tell her that if she wants to sell everything that she can come here and she can do it herself. Maybe she can stop by and say hi to her only child while she's at it. Sam! evans automotive. Hello? Hello? Hello? That's the fifth hang-up today, man. Hey, as your friend I'm here for you, but as your manager, you gotta get this wacko to stop calling here. I... hey, can I help you? Looking for dave kroupa. Uh, that's me. What's this about? Cari farver. We understand she's your girlfriend. I wouldn't call her that. We only dated a few weeks. She broke it off last Thursday. Thursday? Uh-huh. Wednesday the 25th is the last day anyone else saw cari, according to our information. Wait, cari's missing? You don't think I did anything. Why did the relationship end? She wanted to move in together and I said no, and then she... She went kind of crazy. Well, look. She's been harassing me and liz golyar, this other woman that I'm dating. Cari know about this? Yeah, we weren't exclusive. Would you say cari was unhappy about your breakup? Well, if these texts are any indication, yeah. She says, "hey, asshole. You better watch your back. I know where to find you." I mean, there's tons more like that. So, yeah, I'd say she's probably pretty unhappy. Come to the station and we'll help you file a complaint. In the meantime, if you hear from cari, give us a call. Why is she so fixated on you, if you only dated for a couple of weeks? Beats me. And me. Why's she so fixated on me? Because she's crazy, clearly. I just didn't see it. It's not your fault. I mean, it's not entirely your fault. I'll take it. You could have meted out a much worse punishment, but I promise I will make it up to you. Yeah, you will. Spend July 4th with me. Oh, um... I'm barbecuing with nick. I just have to ask. Tell him I'll make my grandma's potato salad. Nothing is more delicious. I promise. sam, I hate to ask you this. But has she been taking her medication? I'm not sure if that's what this is about, but it might be. I don't know. I should have paid more attention. I'm sorry. No, sam. It's not your job. Come on. We have lots of work to do. I'm going to unplug some stuff. You go pack, okay? I don't want to lose our house, grandma. I know. Grandpa and I will cover the mortgage 'til... 'til your mom gets back. I'm ready, grandma. What's wrong? Nothing, I just... Let's just get out of here, okay? Spill a little extra in my cup. Yeah! Ladies. Thank you, sir. Mm, alright, we have to toast. - Um, I will start. - Thanks. Here's to you two. For setting me up with this guy. - Thanks, babe. - Aww. Cheers. Uh, and I'll toast to having somewhere to go when I can't spend the fourth with my kids. Liz? There have been holidays where I have felt very alone. So, thanks, you guys for making it more tolerable. We're just tolerable? Oh, shut up. Cheers. Cheers. Anyone want some more vegetables? Think I made too much food. Sam? You okay, pal? Yeah. Well, I, uh, think I'll take some watermelon. I think jacob and hillary are going to be home from their honeymoon on Sunday. I wouldn't want to come back from the caribbean. Well, maybe someday we can take you. Right. what's wrong with him? It's okay. They both made apple pies. We both have secret family recipes. Mine being the best, obviously. - Okay, we'll see about that. - We will. which one should I try first? - Mine? - Mine. oh, that might be my kids. Everything okay? Uh, yeah. "I spy with my little eye, "you wearing a blue shirt and eating apple pie"? Cari. She's watching? I don't know. Oh my god. how did she get my number? Wait. Are you serious? - She texted you? - No way. What does it say? It's a link... To an obituary. "I didn't know liz golyar very well, "except that she was a man-stealer "and a whore. "rest in peace, liz. "maybe her ugly kids will be next." what? oh, come on, pick up. Pick up. Liz hi there, howdy! It's liz. - Damn it! - You know what to do. Liz, liz, hey. It's dave. Call me back as soon as you get this, okay? It's urgent. I'm on my way to your house now. Damn it. Liz?! Liz?! Liz! Are you in there? Liz?! hey, this is dave kroupa. I just found cari's car in my parking lot. I need you to get here right away. Let me talk to miller. Now! Now! If I could get everyone here to stand back, give us some space. Thank you. All clear. I could send a patrol car to liz's house to check on her. Okay. Okay. it's liz. It's liz! Hey, are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. - Good, good. - What's going on? - You're scaring me. - No, no, no. Everything's okay. I'll explain later. I just... I think it's better if I stay at your house tonight, okay? Okay. Okay, great. I'll be right over. You have no idea how terrible I feel for dragging you into this nightmare. Well... There are a lot of whack jobs out there. You got unlucky. Don't get me wrong, I'm still pissed at you for bringing this lunatic into our lives. Yet, you didn't just bail. My stomach drops every time I get a text. I change my number, she finds it. I block her, she star 67s or calls from a different number. was that her? No. It's a telemarketer. Who knew I'd ever be so happy to get a spam call? god, I can't take this anymore. "you are a worthless whore, liz. "yesterday was a warning. "but maybe I really should do dave and me a favor "and get rid of you and your bratty kids for good." jesus. Hey, you have to send that to the detectives. Hey, aunt nancy. Holding up okay? yeah. I'm okay. I just can't believe that cari missed her father's funeral. She really didn't call? And sam still hasn't heard anything either? Just an apology for not being here today... By text... With this little exclamation point at the end, like she was... Missing some sort of casual Sunday dinner. No more texts. Cari, if you want to communicate with me, it needs to be in person or by phone. Yes. And? She just texted me back and she said... I've always been so controlling and that I'm a bad mother. Well, we both know that's not true. you're wonderful. It's okay. Thank you. car's dusted and there are no prints inside or out, except one, on a mint tin in the center console. Anyone turn up? No, and it doesn't match anyone on the database. - Hey. - Hey, babe. Everything okay? I'm still at work. Yeah, fine, just checking to see if you heard anything from the cops. Yeah. They said the picture of you tied up in the car was photoshopped. oh my god! Dave, my house! What? What? What's happened? Liz? - Holy... - Liz? Hello? Liz, what's going on? Hello?! Oh my god. liz! Liz! you okay? Are you okay? They're gone, dave. they're gone. Wait, wait. What? What? they're dead. Whiskey and marbles, they're dead. They died in the fire. They're gone. Mr. Kroupa? We're waiting for confirmation. But the investigators are thinking that this is most likely an intentionally set fire. Oh my god. There is just one person who is sick enough to do this - cari farver. None of this makes any sense, right? I mean, there's no sign of cari for months, not a single legitimate tip on the hotline. Her only communication is via text message or emails sent to dave, liz, nancy, and sam. She skips over family events. suddenly, she's burning down houses? - What? - Think about it. There hasn't been a single sighting of cari since... - She disappeared. - She disappeared. No sightings of cari, no recent bank activity, which makes sense for somebody who doesn't want to be found... Or it means that person is deceased. Yet, we have no evidence to suggest that she's dead. That's true. But I say we start from scratch. You try to prove that cari's still alive, and I'll try to prove that she's dead. Okay, if she's alive, then the question is where is she? And if she's dead, that means someone else is sending the texts and emails. Maybe someone with tech know-how. What the hell are you saying? That I know what happened to cari? No? I didn't know she was missing. Jesus... Do I need a lawyer? I don't know. Do you, james? If you're trying to pin whatever happened to her on me, then, yeah. It's pretty clear there's no love lost between you two. You made threats. Told her she'd regret putting that r.O. On you. Regret it because I didn't lawyer up and put her ass in debt for a false restraining order. False. The r.O. States you were stalking her, harassing her at work, at home. Hey, man, I was trying to get my stuff. Colleague with her at the sushi restaurant said that you yelled, "if you were trapped in a burning building, "I'd throw gasoline on it. "you deserve to get what's coming to you... Bitch." guess I shouldn't have said that. And you blamed cari for getting you fired. I did. I still do, but... You snapped. Cari created a lot of problems for you. I have a temper. I said a lot of terrible things, but words aren't a crime. They are when you put them into action. Prove I did anything. If you can't, then I'd like to go now. hello? Hi, I'm looking for nancy raney or sam farver. This is nancy. I'm a coordinator at the south omaha women's center. The homeless shelter? Yeah. We have your daughter, cari, here. cari? She's alive? Yes, and she's ready to come home. Oh my god. thank you. Excuse me? Oh. How can I help you? Um, someone called me to tell me that my daughter is here. Cari farver. I think it was a coordinator. It's spelled "c-a-r-I". Cari farver. I don't have any caris. Could she be going by another name? I don't think so. This is a photo of her here. I haven't seen her. I, uh... I could get my manager, to do a walk-through and have a look for her. Thank you. Just use my stuff while you're staying with me. With the kids at their dad's for now, I want to buy them some of the stuff they had before, so they feel more at home. Yeah, I get it. I'm looking at apartments tomorrow. Great. But you can, you know, stay with me as long as you need. - Is that sara? - Yeah. Apparently, she can't even go shopping with the kids by herself. Maybe the kids begged him to come along. You know how they are - always wanting their parents together. Unfortunately, I don't think they're the only ones wanting that. Oh, come on. What makes you say that? Oh, I don't know. That little interaction right there. Hey... He's with you. I get the feeling she would do anything to get dave back. We looked through all the common areas - the showers, the restrooms, the kitchen, even the back alley. She's not here. I'm sorry. I don't understand. Then, who called me? It was a man's voice. - Are you sure? - Yes. Because we don't have any men that work here. I'm so sorry. Ms. Golyar. Oh good. I need to talk to you. Is everything okay? Yeah, but I wanted to tell you guys I'm not so sure that cari is the stalker anymore 'cause... I think it might be sara brower. Dave's ex? I think she might be the one who burned down my house. Okay. And the texts are still coming in 24/7. Could I see these latest ones? Sure. There's so many. Okay, I'll talk to ms. Brower. In the meantime, do you mind if I have my tech guy do a quick download? No problem. Okay. Right this way. come on. You know these. These are easy. what the hell? jesus... What the hell, dave? - Jane, hey, no, no, no, no. - No, you listen. Please, please, please, do not hang up. I have no idea what is going on. - You're sending me... - I did not text you. What? You've been sending me texts. No, I looked at my phone and there is zero texts from me to you. - That is nonsense. - Okay, can you just... Will you please just send me a screenshot of your phone? A screenshot? Okay. Fine. Thanks. You get it? Dave?! Yeah, I-I see it, but I did not send those texts. Okay, we're done. Dave? Yeah, hey. Your door was open. Wait. What? Okay, kiddos, go get your stuff. - Emily's got ballet tonight. - Okay, fine. Have you seen your door? No. Why? Jesus... Who would say such a thing about you? I'm worried, dave, about your safety and the kids. Me, too. Excuse me. Mrs. Raney. Oh, thank god. I got a text from cari, but I know it's not cari. Look. She says she's getting married, but that's not her hand. I know you don't believe me, but I don't care. I am not crazy. This is not my daughter's hand. We believe you. You do? We've made some recent breakthroughs... What? And we don't think cari left on her own accord. Where is she? Do you know? Can you tell me, please? Where is she? Is she safe? We're doing the best we can. It may take time to figure out what's happened, but we will. So, buddy, what do you think about their theory? theory? - Yeah. - It's nothing. Just that it could be sara, not cari, who's stalking you both. What?! We weren't serious. No, of course not. It just, you know, struck us when we saw you two at the store the other day. I'm sorry, you saw us at the store and you didn't even say anything? What? We just didn't want to interrupt you. And then, you said that you thought sara was stalking us? No. I mean... It crossed my mind. Sara is the one who has a lot to lose and a lot to gain. Are you serious right now? It was just a vibe we got. A vibe?! You don't know her, neither of you do. Why are you sticking up for her? Because she never would have done all of these crazy things. Okay, you know what? Never mind. Forget about it. No, no, no. Sara's not a psychopath. She's a really good person. Wow. Okay, then. Well, maybe you should get back together with sara because she's such an angel and I'm, apparently, a terrible person for thinking anything horrible about sara. That's what you just said. So, excuse me for being just a little bit traumatized by everything that has gone down - my garage vandalized, my house burned down, my dogs killed, and harassing threats every single day. But I got it wrong, so, you know, sue me. Liz, come on. No. Leave me alone. hey. Hey. Is she okay? They were able to remove the bullet, but she's still in surgery. Well, is she going to be all right? Well, should know more in an hour or so. This is insane. Who would shoot her? Council bluffs pd are still at the scene. But liz identified the suspect. Who was it? Was it cari? I... did you find her? Did you arrest her? Not exactly. Liz said it was sara brower. Sara? That's... that's not possible. We're looking for the weapon in the lake right now. Only thing we know for sure is ballistics. The bullet was a 9mm from a smith and wesson. Oh my god. That's my gun. oh my god. What is going on? Sara brower? Yes. Liz golyar has been shot. What? Who? She says you did it. That's insane. I've been at home with my kids all night. We need to ask you a few questions down at the station. Is your name sara brower? Yes. Do you know liz golyar? No. Were you upset about her romantic involvement with dave kroupa? No. Were you at big lake park this evening? No. Were you any place other than your home tonight after eight p.M.? No! I didn't shoot liz! I'm so glad you're okay. The surgeon said it was a miracle the bullet didn't hit a major artery. My kids, can you call them? No, they're fine. They're with their dad. God... Look, I'm... I'm so sorry. If we hadn't been fighting, then you wouldn't have left, and this wouldn't happen. That's okay. Sorry to disturb you both. That's okay. I'm gonna go get her another blanket. It's good to see you awake, liz. How you feeling? how do you think? Well, we'll take an official statement when you're feeling up to it. For now, forensics will grab some prints and we'll let you get back to sleep. Prints? Like fingerprints? It's standard procedure, for elimination purposes. So, we know which prints from the crime scene are not the criminal's. Oh, okay. Okay. What about sara? We have her prints already. But are you arresting her? Unfortunately, we can't detain her. Why? The woman tried to kill me. Well, without the gun or a confession, we don't have enough evidence to arrest her just yet. Right hand, please. Detective kava, you look like you haven't slept in days. Well, until someone comes up with microsoft homicide, it's nothing but endless hours looking through digital files. Anything interesting yet? Liz deleted her call history, her texts, her photos, but it's all still there in the software. There is one thing, though. We're listening. You said liz and cari don't know each other, right? According to her and dave, they only crossed paths for a few seconds, didn't even speak. Which is why it doesn't make sense that liz called cari six times before she disappeared. Let me get you another pillows. Oh, and a glass of water? Yeah, of course. All right, there you go. hey, I was thinking, maybe I'll microwave some popcorn, and then we can watch one of those '90s rom-coms you love so much. Wow, you really do feel guilty. Hey. Thanks for taking care of me. Of course. I mean, after everything you've been through, the least I can do is help you convalesce. So, in my initial download of liz's thousands of texts, calls, emails, photographs, I didn't see anything worth noting. But check this out! With this physical download, I'm getting all of her wiped data. That's how you found the calls to cari. Exactly! And also this... It's an app called pretext. Now, I didn't think anything of it. It's just a texting app. Why wouldn't she just text normally? Great question. This app allows the user to pre-schedule a text and make it look like that text is coming from a different number. So, what you're saying is that liz could use this app to text somebody and make it look like it came from cari. Bingo. And she could even preschedule a text and make it look like it's coming from cari. So, not only could you have "cari" text dave, but... But she could text herself herself to make it look like she's also getting stalked. When, in fact, she's the actual stalker. Kava, you brilliant son-of-a-bitch! Keep going, see what else you can find. We'll be back. Christine, we have a breakthrough in the farver case. Whoa. What can I do? Pull up the print we found in cari's car and run it against liz golyar's prints - the ones you took at the hospital. Okay, just give me a second. It's a match. Here you go. Thanks, babe. Yeah. No problem. hello. Dave. Detective adams. Yeah, hey. I wanted to let you know that sara's neighbor saw her the night of the shooting, so she's been cleared. That's great. But there's something else. Are you alone? Uh, no. I'm with liz. Can you meet us somewhere? By yourself. Okay, sure. Why? Because she may be dangerous. Who is it? Uh, it's, um, nick. Tell him I said, "what's up?" okay, yeah. Uh, hello? I don't know how to tell you this. We have evidence that points to liz golyar. Dave, she's your stalker. No, no. I was... I was with liz when we both got texts our phones. She couldn't have texted herself. We have digital proof that liz was impersonating cari with an app. Okay, so, she shot herself? She burned down her house? Her two dogs were in that house. Unfortunately, yes, it looks like she did all those things. You're s... Oh my... I... Oh my god. Oh my god. I know, I know. She had us fooled, too. So, it wasn't cari. We think cari is dead. This whole time, I thought... But you're telling me that you think liz... Was involved in cari's death, yeah. But we don't have enough evidence for a murder charge... Yet. There's something else. You and sara may be in danger. And my kids. If I were you, I wouldn't want them to be alone. Thanks for coming in today. Yeah, anything I can do to help. Can we get you coffee or water or...? No. Thank you. Well, the reason we brought you in today is because we found remains. Human remains. Okay. We're waiting for the lab for a positive id, but we suspect it's cari farver. Well, I only met cari one time, so... Yeah, uh, but you are one of the victims in the stalker case... Are you looking at sara brower? Well, we were looking at cari. But now, we're thinking, if sara was so bold as to do this with you, maybe she did it to cari, as well. Sara keeps coming in and out of dave's life, so, I'm just saying, as another person who would be... Possessive of dave, it'd be her. The problem is, we don't have any evidence. Okay. If, for example, we had anything of sara inferring that she had done something to cari... ..That'd be gold. We could build a murder case with that. You mean, you need her to admit it? Well, that or threatening statements of some kind, yeah. Hey. Hey. Uh, I got you a beer. Sorry I'm late. So, uh... I have some news. Danny's been getting into fights at school, acting out. Oh no. Yeah. I guess he punched a girl at the water fountain. What? So, anyway, we talked to his teacher and she thinks it's best if I'm maybe around a little bit more. But you're around all the time. I know. I know. And I know you'll understand, as a parent, that, obviously, kids come first. So, uh... I'm gonna have to move back into the house with sara and the kids for a little bit. Is this some kind of sick joke? No, no, I just, you know, danny's... What the hell? Dave, are you kidding me right now? You're telling me you're gonna move back in with a woman who tried to kill me? She shot me, dave. I mean, that's still under investigation. It might... Oh, wait, wait, wait. So, you're telling me you don't believe me now? Is that what you're saying? We're back to that again? You don't... You don't believe me? No, I completely trust you. You are a son-of-a bitch, dave. You're the one that asked me to move in with you. No. I just said that you could... I said that you could stay with me as long as you needed. But then, all this stuff with danny happened... No, that's not what you said! That is not what you said! Go to hell, dave! Go to hell! About time. Bad news is there was traffic. Good news is there's a triple shot in there. You're forgiven. Anything? Well, she didn't waste time. Came in this morning and this was waiting in my in-box. Liz forwarded it over and, apparently, it's from sara. "when I met crazy cari, "she would not stop talking about dave being her husband. "she tried to attack me, "but I stabbed her three to four times "in the chest and stomach area. "I, then, took her out and burned her. "I stuffed her body in a garbage can with crap." wow. Very first email is a straight-up murder confession. She knows that's what we need. Well, we know what the murder weapon is now, all we need is a body. So, where do you want me to put my stuff? I don't like this, dave. Look, it's not forever. No, I mean... How dangerous do they think she is? I just want you and the kids to be safe. this is detective adams. Looks like the only person that benefitted was sara because she gets to shoot somebody, and she gets to kill another person, and she gets to live with dave, and she gets to be free, and you guys aren't arresting her. Well, we know this must be hard on you, but we need more evidence in order to make a murder charge stick. We're building a case. We don't want to move forward unless it's rock solid. I don't understand. What more do you need? She confessed! We need details, things that only the killer would know. Aah! is it liz? Yup. "from sara." "I really did kill cari "and I did it in her own car." her freaking car? Jackpot! We've got some blood. Let's get dna. This is cari's. It looks like there's hair. Will this work? I think so. Thank you. Um... A few days ago, I had a dream. It was very vivid. Cari's dad came to me, and he told me not to worry about carrie anymore because she was with him. She's gone. I know. I just... I don't know how to tell her son that... His mom's dead. how do I do that? How do I tell him? who wants orange juice? I do! Okay, sweetie, grab yourself a glass and I'll pour it for you. Oh my god! Mommy! - What happened? - Daddy! You okay? You all right? All right. I'm calling the cops. All right. I think it's gonna be a really fun weekend. - With the kids? - Yeah. Things are going really well with dave. blood in the vehicle's a match to cari farver's dna. How's the search going? Well, we found multiple phones, a camera, a tablet, all at liz's house. Kava's gonna have a field day. Where's liz? In processing. They won't be able to hold her long, though. I think we've got enough. You ready to do this? why am I here? I got to pick up my kids soon. We need to ask you some questions about a few items we found in your house. In my house? Yes. We got a warrant. Why? Because you think I threw a rock? We found a bunch of electronics we believe belonged to cari farver. My kids have tons of electronics, and their friends are always bringing over devices. You probably found one of their ipads or whatever. These belonged to cari farver. Cari's never been to my house. I don't know cari. I met her one time. We also found evidence that shows you've been sending emails using cari's account. No, I didn't. Did you load an app on your phone called pretext? No, I didn't. Because that's what you've been using to text dave and yourself, posing as cari. No, I didn't. We have the digital evidence, liz. And we know the emails you forwarded to us from sara were actually created by you. - I haven't created any emails. - Keep in mind, lying to a government official is also a crime. I don't... I don't know what to tell you. I-I'm... Someone shot me. Someone burned down my house. Well, you set the fire. Investigators found candles beside the electric heater and the accelerant on the back deck. Plenty of time for you to leave the house before it ignited. I'm not gonna be accused of something I didn't do! You're not going to admit to this? I'm done talking, and I'm going to have my attorney because I didn't do anything. We have confirmation that this foot is decomposing and the tattoo is consistent with many photos of cari farver. This is her foot. The photo was found in the deleted data of your cell phone. Your fingerprint matches a print found inside cari's vehicle. We could go on and on. There's much more evidence. But I think you know by now this is over. Just so you know, that tattoo on your victim's foot... It's the chinese symbol for "mother". In the case of nebraska vs. Shanna elizabeth golyar, the defense's argument has been refuted by the overwhelming evidence presented. Cari farver did not voluntarily disappear off the face of the earth. Very sadly, she was murdered. The court finds that the defendant shanna elizabeth golyar guilty of first-degree murder and arson in the second degree. How did you feel when it was finally over, after liz was convicted? Honestly, I still can't believe it even happened. Have you been able to grieve for cari? I mean, I've cried. But I just... I don't really like to go there; I can't bear it. And yet, here you are, helping to tell her story. It's the least I can do. I think about her son sam all the time, and her mother nancy. it's just something I'll never forget. your mom would have wanted you to be happy, sam. I know. So, the best thing for you to do is look forward and go out there and live a good life. I'll try, grandma. But only if you do, too.
