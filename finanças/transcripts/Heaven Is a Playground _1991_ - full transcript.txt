Byron. We're gonna improve ourselves this summer. Get that beer out of here, Case. Go on. ANDRE: And to show you how serious we are, we want you to coach us. CECIL: Yo, you see, Byron, man we gonna take on any motherfuckers with enough guts to play us. You wanna play here, you leave that street talk out in the street. You asked for it, man. I'm gonna rip your tongue out now. Wait a minute, Herc. ALL: Pride, respect. Pride, respect. Pride, respect. BYRON: Showtime. Showtime. Showtime. Pride, respect. Pride, respect. BYRON: I can't hear you! ALL: Pride. Respect Go some one-on-one? You must be lost. Hey, what are you doing? I got better luck keeping out local crack dealers than you entrepreneurs from the suburbs. PLAYER: Get out, white boy! PLAYER 2: Let's do it, Byron. Run him out! Oh, you're Byron Harper, the guy in the article. It says in here that you run the best pick-up games-- And you came early for a good seat. No, man, I came to play. [LAUGHTER] No pushers in my playground. I'm not a pusher. No agents, no scouts, neither. You're all pushing something. Yo, William. ZACK: No, no, I'm a lawyer. BYRON: With a basketball for a briefcase? ZACK: I just quit my father's law firm. BYRON: And I'm a nuclear scientist. Now, get your butt away from here. You can't legally kick me out. Get on! Give it up Or you're through. But it's mine. You ain't staying here. Yes, I am. This is a public playground. Ain't no democracy in my playground, Ollie North. PLAYER: It's Williams, man. BYRON: What is it? Watch out. What is it, what happened? PLAYER 2: Is he dead? BYRON: Who's got a car? Who's got a car?! ZACK: I do. Go get it. Hurry up. [TIRES SCREECH] All right, that's good right there. Are you the boy's father? Closest he's got. I need some information. The boy's been shot. We'll do all the paperwork later. I need proof he's insured before I'll admit him. Goddamn it, get him to a doctor right now. I'll have you arrested. And I'll sue you and this hospital so fast your head'll spin. Sir, policy dictates-- I don't care. Clark vs. Urban Memorial, 1985. $20 million bucks for gross negligence. You want some? I suppose this is an emergency. I thought he is. Let's get moving here. Let's go, let's go. WOMAN ON PA: Dr. Lopez to intensive care. He'll live, Byron. Oh, thanks, doc. But the boy lost a lung. He'll never play ball again. Don't tell him, doc. You get him strong first. If William hears he can't play ball... he's gonna die. Thank you, doctor. [SIGHS] What did he shoot that kid for? Because they live in Beirut, U.S.A. You mean, he just shot him? Where the hell you from? Down state. Fairfield. Fairfield? Go home, man. For all our sakes, just go home. ZACK: Byron ran his playground like a boot camp. But the rule is if you can play, you can stay. And I was staying. I told you not to come back here. Look, I just came to play. Why won't you let me play? Playing here is gonna cost you. Cash or check? Come here, knuckleheads. Meet your new coach. Hey, forget it. I'm no coach. No, we want you, Byron. Yeah, not this sorry-ass white boy. Go one on one. I'll spot you five, big mouth. See, look, he's a mental case. That's why he's perfect for you, Caseman. Run some three-man a full court. And just keep them out of my face. Man... [♪♪♪] You hack me again, you history. Bring that lucky shit again. All right. Check it up. Way to smoke him, coach. You ain't on our team, you little pigmy. Yes, I am. Those guys are idiots. Yeah. But they be your idiots, now. [LAUGHS] My last year at Wesleyan, I was all-conference. Dinky little league. Why didn't you go to a major U? Guess I wanted to stay near home. Good P.R. for the family law firm. Blue blood lawyers? Spent the last nine months defending this tractor company. Had to prove it was this poor farmer's fault his arms got ripped off by their machine. The whole thing made me so sick... I quit. Now what you gonna do with your life? Go brain dead this whole summer. No thinking. I'm just playing ball. BYRON: No, I don't live in the projects, Fairfield. The kids wouldn't listen to me if I hadn't got out. Right here at the green house. Stop. But Byron, you're only 50 yards out. Out is out. How're my girls? Hi, baby. Hey, Dee Dee. [BABY GIGGLES] $600 phone bill, Byron? Oh, baby, I'll cut back. Any calls? Coach Richards, three times. Coach Lane and Coach Bev. BYRON: Mm. [PHONE RINGS] Byron here. Hey, coach. Yeah, I got one right here. Power forward. Any academic requirements? You with the IRS? He's a big time lawyer, baby. Yeah, Coach. I got a real banger for you. A man-child. Come to my park Labor Day. You can see him live. All right. Come on, Fairfield. Deedee! Excuse me. I produced this, Fairfield. My boy's gonna be a movie star. Look at him go. Now watch this move coming up right here. BYRON: Showtime. Showtime! Oh, man, look at that. Get on. Truth's a big hero in the projects. Know anything about him, Fairfield? Who doesn't know about the Truth? 6'5", 210. Averaged 32 a game last year as a junior. Mmhm. He's my son. Your son? You must be proud. He's gonna be a heck of a pro when he graduates. Nobody knows this, but, uh... he might turn pro this summer. Skip his senior year. What? You're talking big headlines. This from a sports lawyer who wants to represent Truth. David Racine. Mm-hm. Whoa! "And if you share my opinion "that an early entrance into the professional game "is in Truth's best interest, I'd be most happy to discuss representing him." Well, what are you waiting for? I need a lawyer to explain the legal stuff. Well, there's plenty of lawyers in Chicago. They're all in bed with Racine. Or want to be. I can't trust them. Well, you just met me. I got keen instincts, Fairfield. You're a straight-shooter. Well, I'd have to meet my potential client before I could commit to anything. Commit to me now and I'll get you in a game with Truth. Game? A game. Deal. I'll sit in on the first meeting. All right. After then, and depending on how you do maybe I'll get you in to the second. Hey, baby, Fairfield's staying over. WOMAN: He certainly is not. Baby, he can't sleep in the gutter, and Truth ain't here. Not my problem. I got a room at the Holiday Inn. Baby, look, he's helping with Truth. He's gotta know Truth's world. [DOOR CLOSES] Girl's crazy about me, Fairfield. My name's not Fairfield. It's Zack. Cool. BYRON: Come on, now. Come on out. Don't give up. You give up, your opponent steals your heart. He steals your heart, you've lost the game. ZACK: Byron was on a mission with his Breds. But if you didn't have a serious talent, and a serious attitude, he wanted you in one place, on the sidelines. What's up? Should we run laps, too, Zack? I'm not your coach. Yeah, well, Byron says you are. You've played organized ball. Organize us. Let's just pick up another guy and run threes. Yeah, calling all cars for one man. We accept cripples. What about him? ANDRE: Matthew never plays, coach. I could play, I could play. I'll be good, I'll be good. Go away before I smack you, flea. You're with me, Gus. All right! Yeah! Man... You, me and Big Man. No, man, no. Come on, take it up. [TIRES SCREECHING] [♪♪♪] Your homeboy's home. Yo, what's up? What's up? ZACK: Sparks flew from Truth. Everybody wanted to be near him. There was no doubt about it, he was a star. Well, damn, Truth. Where did you get that rhythm, head fine hammer over there, homeboy? You mean Lawanda? CASEY: Yeah. She sure is fine, man. She's just a little something to play around with, you know. Hey, Truth, I saw you on TV the other day. Yeah? How'd I look? I look good or what? I almost kissed the screen. Baby, you know, if I couldn't shoot the rock, you know you wouldn't give me no rhythm. Uh-uh, you were always fine to me. Used to be the ladies thought I was ugly. Yo, By. Now I'm playing ball and shit. All the bitches is on my dick. [CROWD CHATTERING AND LAUGHING] I'm getting ready to get out of here. I'm gonna be here all summer, so we can, like, kick it, right? All right. [CROWD RESPONDING] We all got our Truth, man. How's classes, man? How's classes? Truth. Catch you later, bro. Well, what's happening with gray-boy? He's our legal consultant for Racine. I'm Zack Telander. I'm really pleased to meet you. I'm such a fan. [LAUGHS] Yeah, I'm pleased to meet you, too. You think I'm ready for the pros? Right now. I'm just not sure they're ready for you. [LAUGHS] I like him, By. I'll think we'll keep him. I'll catch you all later. Wow. He's something, huh? Yeah, he sure is. Damn. If I had Truth's ability, girls in college would be crawling all after me, man. Even if I was mentally retarded. But that's what you is, chrome-dome. [LAUGHING] Fuck you, Herc. Salami sandwich eating motherfucker. Thank you, ma'am. Truth's psyched about going pro. Not as much as I am. See, I've always discovered kids, man. 10, 20-year-olds. Give them a clean place to work on their game. Get whoever I want into college. But I had this dream of taking kids from my playground all the way to the pros. Interesting concept. What's in it for you? I ain't no meat seller, goddamn it. I ain't never take no money from my boys. I'm sorry. I just never heard of a non-profit farm system. Well, that's my dream. I wanna bring pride here, Fairfield. But I need a boy with pro talent for it to come true. And Truth... is the one. Truth said, "Put the whole park on my back. I'll carry them all out of the projects." [CELL PHONE RINGS] PLAYER: You playing, Fairfield? Byron here. ZACK: Hey, I had next down Coach. How is the University of Alaska? BYRON: Got whatever you need, Coach. My playground is a gold mine of talent. Alaska is begging me, boys. "Byron, send me a city player." Sh-- Too cold and too dark for my Breds, but Byron's gonna be looking out the corner of his eyes this summer. And which ever one of you all improves the most, that boy's getting a ride to the North Pole. [♪♪♪] Zachary. This is a place that can change your life. Mr. Harper? Yes. Hi, I'm Dalton Ellis, Vice President of team sports. Zack Telander. Pleased to meet you. And you. Let's go. Thank you. Thank you. Damn. Hey, Zack. Check out our man. I could watch Truth play all day long. Mr. Racine. Byron Harper, sir. It's a real pleasure meeting you. You're the only agent in America who hasn't been dogging me, phoning me, sucking up to me over Truth. I'm keenly aware of that. Zachary Telander, counsel to Byron Harper and to Truth. Dalton Ellis, my Vice President in charge of team sports. But then, of course, you met. Sit down, gentlemen, won't you? Thank you. Byron, what can I do for you? You see, Mr. Racine I want Truth to get a million dollar signing bonus. Multi-year secure contract. A million dollar endorsement. Byron, all-stars make millions, not undisciplined rookies. Until now. [LAUGHS] Mr. Racine, Truth's gonna revolutionize sports economics. I see Truth in New York or L.A. or Chicago. On a team that runs? Well, let's not forget about Portland or Denver. Well, those are bona fide fast-break teams. DALTON: Oh, Mr. Racine is not referring to style of play. He's alluding to-- Cities where I can maximize Truth's media exposure. Oh, yes, sir. Truth's got a lot of personality, Mr. Racine. What Truth has is a maturity problem. That's just because he's a junior. A maturity problem that hurts his market appeal. But everybody loves a score. So do I. I also love to handle athletes who can represent themselves and corporations. Athletes who transcend their sport. Can Truth transcend his sport? No. With teamwork... you and I can transform Truth's immaturity into flamboyance, grace, elegance. Truth will transcend his sport. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Racine. I'm gonna bring all my boys straight to Racine and we're gonna transcend the sport. [LAUGHS] And Racine will be a good place for a lost soul like you too. Byron, I'm not lost. Give me a lift to my job. There you go. How many do you want, four? One, two, three, four. There you go. Best seats in the house. Got shade for the ladies. Byron, you call this work? Playground's my work, Zack. This is my job. Best seats-- Hey, man, what you doing? Hey, you his partner? No, he's my boy. Oh. You're a wise-ass, Satchmo. Kiss my ass, Bozo. Move it! Beat it! Zack, it's all right. I'll take care of it. Mind your business. You're a gold-plated pain in the ass. Now, I'm gonna book you. Byron, nobody wants my boy. Charlie, there ain't no market for a slow white boys. Yeah, but Byron you ain't tried yet. You get my boy into school, I'll kiss you on the lips. Hey, hey, Charlie, no, no. Arrest me right now. Charlie... can your boy at least hit the jumper? ♪ Baby, baby, Baby don't leave me ♪ [TURNS OFF RADIO] I hate white people. I ever see you again, I'll blow off your fucking head. Now, get the fuck out of Dodge. HERC: Hey, yo, Jesse James. You gotta chill, man, okay? Chill. He ain't white. He's our coach, man. Yeah, I'm the coach. Chill, man. Come on, chill. Thanks, man. Yeah, coach. ZACK: It was a fair trade. Herc saved my life, so I agreed to coach. Finally got to use all those fundamentals coaches had tortured me with. It's your head. You think too much. Really? Yeah. Just stroke it. BYRON: Five seconds to go. Bulls down by one. Harper's got the ball. Three...two...one...he shoots. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. He made it. He made it. Hey, Byron. Do grades matter for that ride to Alaska? You blind? Did you see what I just did? I was Valedictorian in my class with a 3.9. I think if-- Whoa, whoa, whoa, Einstein. Coaches call me for players, not eggheads. Even Harvard's gonna say, "Byron... when's the last time that boy canned a jumper?" [♪♪♪] BYRON: Zack, I just got a kid who had two broken shoulders and never played a second of high school basketball in the Kissimee J.C. Byron, what about those kids you made me coach? Cruel and unusual punishment, huh? You gonna get them any scholarships? Boy, are you crazy? TV ANNOUNCER: A reliable source informs me that Truth Harrison may bypass his senior season and take his show of thrills to the NBA. Reliable source? With an arsenal of shots, he has been virtually unstoppable at the college level. Truth's trademark is his quick-release jumpshot and his almost unlimited range. Byron when Truth signs, what do you get? More of this. More of this. I want you to schedule a scrimmage between your Breds and my guys. You mean those sorry knuckleheads? Yeah. I think a game situation is gonna help them concentrate. Focus, absorb all the things I've been saying. What? No way in hell. Guys, I got Byron to give us a game with his Breds. Really? Yeah. Ooh, we need a name now, brothers. GUS: Yeah, man. Jerseys, too. Let's make fifty and sell them for $10 bucks a piece. Shut up, little Gus. Fuck you, Herc. [LAUGHING] Fuck all of you, man. I got our name. The Cabrini Green Traveling Hitmen. That's nice, Caseman. Criminals? Hitmen? The city's too bright for stars. I seen them once. In a book. Stars...stars. The Shooting Stars. I get it. Like, we get to carry guns. HERC: No, you goggle-faced dope. It means we're great players who hit the jumper. Yeah. Good call, Andre. That's smooth. I likes. I likes that. Sorry, Zack. Some things are just sacred, man. Oh. Sorry. [LAUGHING] ZACK: Beauty isn't so much where you find it, as when. We found it for the moment up there in the night. It felt good. It always feels good when people agree. Fucking Shooting Stars.

ZACK: We were pretty taken with Racine. Thought he was all style and clout. But, man, what I really liked was his glass backboards. DALTON: This complex is part of Racine's Sports' real estate portfolio. Good to see you, gentlemen. Good afternoon. Mr. Racine. Byron. What do you think I can do for Truth's career? I want Truth to be a role model. I want him to get charity games. Image is the whole thing. I'm concerned. That Truth may be very difficult to polish. Hold on. Are you saying I didn't do my job as a father? Not at all. I'm saying I'm willing to represent him. But my fee will be 30 percent. Thirty percent? Three times standard? When you take into consideration my time and energy. To blow smoke up my butt. To compensate for Truth's immaturity. To hell with you. 30 percent is ridiculous. Byron, it's a negotiation. He didn't say anything about your mother. He's sparring with you. Don't take it personally. Come on, stay with me. BYRON: Where did you get your sorry-ass shot, Racine? The zoo? [LAUGHS] DALTON: Yale. We both played there. Yeah, right. You played college? All-American. Kentucky South. RACINE: Oh, really? A pioneer. You must have been one of their first blacks. Would have one pro, too, if my father hadn't got sick. My, my. All pro. Well, we better not go two-on-two. Let's make it one-on-one. Ow! Shit. I wouldn't waste my sweat on you. Zack, stay here and knock this great white off his 30 percent, and into some reality. Whoo! [BYRON LAUGHS] Deal with my lawyer. Whoo, whoo, whoo! Black pride is amazing, isn't it?

That's right. Get up, Dave. I got a sock full of money, all day long. Come on. Get up, boys. Get up. You try it, Matthew. PLAYER: Show us where you at, Matthew. BRED: Yo, Matthew, you know you got some hops, man. BYRON: All right, Breds. Let's get back on it now. Let's go. Get up, get up. Byron's deep concern for Truth, his work down at that playground, it's a mask. He's feeding his own ego. Do you really think Byron's an angel? Yeah, he's sort of a guardian angel. And I'm here to insure that my client gets a fair deal. Fair? Fair. What a concept. Fair has got nothing to do with Truth's talent or Truth's needs or his value to basketball, all right? It's complex. You have to factor in my clout, my tastes and my expertise. Help me help Truth. I can handle the kid. But Byron has got to accept my terms. Or I will make it very difficult for him in professional basketball. Come on. Come work for me. I'm building an empire. I might put my bed under that basket, man. Sleep here. Wake up in the morning. Take a few jams. I just might do that. You hear that? What are you doing, Gus? Come on, Zack. Follow us. [LAUGHS] Truth-- Come on, Truth. Oh, man, Byron, that Matthew, he jumps, he doesn't come down. Byron, he's super-natural. He be flying-- Matthew done crashed and burned in high school, knuckleheads. Besides, I'm the talent scout around here. And I'm the Truth. You get Racine to come down yet? No. Goddamn it! You're gonna be hitting clutch-jumpers. Taking bows in your face, earning your million bucks. And Racine wants you to give him $300,000 for putting you on a jelly jar. Jelly? Bullshit! He said take it or leave it. Tell him it's left. Truth. Racine's just playing hard to get. He's just talking noise. He wants me, I got his letter. No, no, no, man-- Truth, go and have fun with your girl. Me and Zack'll take care of it. But-- Hey, I'm the coach. Byron, Mr. Racine's serious. Seriously insane. Tell Racine to meet me here. In the projects. We'll see if he's got any balls. ZACK: Byron said Racine was his insurance policy. His guarantee that Truth would never end up on the streets again. BYRON: My folks moved me when it changed. But I come back every year. One day I see a little 8 year-old boy eating out of a garbage can. It's Truth. Truth had neighbors like them. All of them. Kids, too. Junkies. Took Truth home. Adopted him before I even married. When do we meet with Racine? Byron, the man says you have to accept his terms. Goddamn mind games. Zack... he's trying to make me give up. Steal my heart. Steal Truth. Just wait a week, and then, then tell him I got another agent. Tell him what? I got another agent. Who? Nobody. I can play mind games, too. Let's go. [♪♪♪] Knowing our season starts today-- that feels so nice, brother. Yes, yes. It's a lovely day in Byron's playground. Shoot them up, homies, shoot them up. GUS: Hey, y'alls, look what I stole us. Here, Cecil. You still can't play worth shit. Here, Casey. Grow a brain. Try to make a shot, Andre. We're a team now, Coach Vanilla. Hey, Herc, now you owe me $10 bucks. Give me number one, Andre. Please, please, Andre. CASEY: Yo, yo, yo, Dre. Give me number seven, man, for good luck. Your IQ on a good day, with shoes on. All right. Hey, Stars, Stars. Listen up, listen up. When you're out in public today, you're gonna be repping Cabrini, the playground and me. You understand? So, no cussing, no spitting, and no fighting, Herc. Tuck in these jerseys. Tuck them in. Let's go. I play better with mine out, though. Tuck this, all right? Yeah, tuck your face, boy. GUS: Please. Brother, I ain't tucking my shirt in. Won't help your game none. The way you look is the way you play. It's all about mental discipline. Oh, shut up, please, man. Hang on a second. Who do you think you are, Dr. Ruth? I got some bad news, Matthew. I thought it over and, uh, I'm afraid you're not good enough to play with us. You're Matthew Lockhart. You were headlines five years ago. You had all the schools in a feeding frenzy. You signed with, uh, UCLA. You were going to be their Messiah. Hey, man, it's a good thing you're doing with those guys. But I don't play, ever. When did you finish high school, Casey? I didn't. Dropped out 10th grade. Was gonna be an armed robber, but then, you know, Byron he... Byron what? Byron saved me. He did? Yeah. Made me one of his Breds. But I'd blow my lay-ups. And I'd drink, you know. I'd play sorrier and have to drink more. One day I showed up to practice all messed up... and Byron dropped me. See, that's how I became so mental. You know Byron, he's kind of-- He's pretty hard on you. Yeah, he is. But I'm gonna win Byron over again. I'm a man now and balling's my job. Where every day I grade myself. Did I hustle? Did I showboat? I think I got a A-minus going, man. There you go. BYRON: All right, Shooting Stars. Court's open, let's go. Let's do it. Let's go. Oh, man, look at those peons, man. We're gonna skunk them. We're gonna put a donut on their ass. Man, be serious. ANDRE: Wait a minute. That's Luther Hakim. ♪ Come on Go, go, come on ♪ He's all pro. What the hell is he doing here?

ZACK: Matthew had this secret place to play. Always alone. I couldn't figure out what he felt about the game. It was like he was this artist making these paintings nobody could see. ZACK: You remember your first dunk? Yeah, I was about 12 years old. I was still just another little shrimp. One night, I had a dream about dunking. So I woke up, I went out to the nearest court, jumped up... yo, and busted my lip on the rim. Never had something hurt so bad that felt so good. The game was fun then. All right, you got nice form there. Thanks. Old faithful. Why did you stop playing? Oh, man. It happened senior night. The gym was rocking, had about 20 points. Five dunks in the first half. So, I'm angling in on a fast break. I'm all alone. I start rising up. And Truth bridges me. He's always been a scoring junkie. He shoots, hits, boom. Self respect. That night, full house. And I shut him down. He tore your knee up because you shut him down? Man! UCLA still wanted me. But in recupe I woke up. Since junior high, the coach, the press, everyone expected me to be the hero every game. Didn't even think of me as a human being. Just some kind of-- some kind of thing, like Truth. I quit. If you ever decide you want to go to school, you know, I-- UCLA, whatever, I think I can get Byron to hook you up. Thanks, but no thanks. ♪ I used to go out to parties ♪ ♪ And stand alone ♪ ♪ 'Cause I was too nervous ♪ ♪ To really get down ♪ ♪ But my body ♪ ♪ Yearned to be free ♪ ♪ I got out on the floor, boy ♪ BYRON: Happy 4th of July to you too coach. What you need is a city ball player. Yeah. Come to my playground, Labor Day, see him live. All right. Bye. Hey. Light or dark? Give me a leg. A leg man, I knew it. Yeah, Racine invited me to a party tonight, but I'm not going. Yeah, you are. Zack, go pull his chain. Tell him how I got Truth another agent. Let me eat first, Byron Well, eat in the car. Come on, Zack. Man... All right, hey. Breds, Breds, Breds. Who wants another piece? Bad news is... I got Truth another agent. I'm hurt. It's a tough business, sir. Oh, yeah, it is. Especially if you think you got a bigger cock than me. Because, trust me, you and Byron Harper together don't. Well, maybe our new agent does. Oh, fuck you. Come on, you're just bluffing. Anyway... you queered this deal. But you know you want this guy. I mean, he led the nation scoring as a junior. He's golden. He's the most impressive scoring machine coming out of college since David Thompson. Yeah, but the pros bang so hard. And they talk such trash. I mean, Truth could go ballistic on me every game. Then where am I? Head cases do not win corporate sponsorships. All right, well what if we get him into a pre-draft camp with all the other future pros? He kicks ass and, uh, keeps his head together, he'll be a media darling. He'll sell himself. And you can lower your fee. Hey, that would put Truth on the dime instead of us. Truth's gonna destroy that camp. You tell Racine that he's a pin-headed dummy to make me that offer. Byron says you're brilliant. I'm glad he's seen the light. Let me wish him a happy fourth. Son of a bitch! There's my boy. ♪ This is The chance of lifetime ♪ [DIALTONE HUMS] Lost him. Hey, Lawanda. How you doing, superstar? By, I'm running on E. Here, take these. Thanks, man. Guess what? We're going to a pre-draft camp. Man, everybody knows I can handle the rock. All it's gonna be is the Truth Harrison Show. I ain't no side-show freak, By. They know what I can do. [TIRES SCREECH] Just keep it. Yeah, just keep it till you burn in the pros. And then I'll be there to deliver and collect. Faster than the pizza man.

And keep them clients. It's relentless. It's a high. It's nothing like the high I get from running the rock with the homeboys every day. That's a high. Right on, brother. Hey, homey. You white boys, you love the way blacks play, so you take on black affectations, like clothes and language and being impressed with Byron Harper. Hey, Byron's trying to do something positive. A ghetto guru. [♪♪♪] Everybody telling me that I'm the Truth. What if I ain't the Truth? What if I ain't got the goods? I'd just be another project product fool who couldn't hang. [TRAIN HORN BLOWS] [BLOWING CONTINUES] BYRON: This ain't no house party, boys. It sure ain't no picnic. This here is your one-way ticket out of here. Half the coaches in America's coming to see y'all. And they gonna want to see who's gonna play the solid D. You play defense with your feet, not your hands. Quick, short, gliding, sliding steps. You got a man? You beat him to the spot. Take the charge, sacrifice your body. [PLAYERS STRAINING] You gotta fight for that rebound, boys. You gotta want the ball. You gotta want it more than you want your girlfriend's drawers. It's your world down there in the paint and you can't give an inch to nobody. Every drop of sweat is money dropping in your bank account. So, come on, work hard. Attack the basket, damn it. Attack the basket. You should be jamming the damn ball. When you jam you're dominating your man. [PLAYER YELLS] Come on now, show me something. Head up, see the floor. Byron. Truth. Thanks, sweetheart. Look, you can't have my autograph. Find your mama. Find your mom, go with your mama. Truth? You always sign for the kids, son. Do you remember when we used to talk? About important things, like, uh, staying out of trouble? Mm-hm. Then you became a man. Went into the 6th grade and said, "Byron, I don't need your advice". Byron... going pro... You scared? Truth, you can't be scared, son. Can't nobody cover you. Hey, Byron, where's mine? Hey, Truth. This trial camp your idea? People beg for me, motherfucker. We ain't going, son. No. I'm chill, Byron. Get me to camp. Racine said he's come here and pick us up tomorrow at 10:00. Good. CECIL: Forget it, man. If I can't go pro, I'll be a garbage man. They make big bucks. I want to be one of them kung fu movie dudes. Walking on one finger and leaping over buildings and shit. I'll be nice. I'll be dunking on everybody. [MAKES MARTIAL ARTS NOISE] I thought you guys disbanded. Caseman's psyche book said, we don't keep playing we catch some serious depression. Yeah, Coach, come on. Run the team. Guys, we're not a team. What we are is a bunch of individuals trying to blame somebody else. We don't listen, we don't pass, we don't play as a unit. Am I right? STARS: Yeah. We play one game as a team. Pass the ball, play as a team. Play one game like that, and we're winners. Deal? STARS: Deal. All right. BYRON: Seven-- 18. 18 coaches flying in for the show, Zack. Truth's going pro. Shit, everything's coming up roses. You know, when I was in high school, I wrote letters to college coaches. 112 of those mothers, long hand. Guess how many wrote me back? How many? Zero. But you walked on to Kentucky South and won their racist hearts with your sweet "J". Busted their ass. What did you play, three years? Four? Oh, man, I never went to college, Zack. I made that up for Racine. I had to. Anyway, six of those same coaches who wouldn't even spit on me, they're now coming to my show. Showtime, boys. Ready, son? Yeah, I'm ready. All right. Good morning, boss. Fairfield. Do I look all right? You look great. DALTON: Hello. Good morning. Good morning. BYRON: Morning. Where stars are born. And you're looking at two supernovas. Mr. Racine, pleased to meet you, sir. Well... shall we? Promised Truth the best rep. You're just lucky it's you. We're all very fortunate. For instance, that Zachary came up with his inspired "Truth goes to camp" solution. I spots all kinds of talent, Racine. Zachary's got ability. He's joining Racine Sport. Wait a minute, I haven't made that-- I know, I know, we haven't discussed it, but it's as inevitable as Truth's impact on the pros. You gonna get me some commercials? Cereals, cars, shoes. Lead the league in scoring, son, I'll get you... a date with the Virgin Mary. There's gonna be press at the camp? Oh, yeah. You're a walking photo opportunity. Here, sign this, Truth. I'll look at that. Standard evaluation camp form. It's okay, Byron. All right. Sign here, Truth. The future is now, son. Walk into this camp and school's out forever. It's hot in here. I need to get some air. [CAMERA FLASHES POPPING] BYRON: Truth, Truth. Truth's God knows where because of your ass. And you're supposed to be working for me, not Racine. I've been working for you this whole time. I don't bullshit all the time, like the genius. Go on. Join Racine's boutique. You sorry-ass, two-faced, lost boy. I'll get Truth into the pros myself. So you can be a star. Racine's right about you. You don't give a shit about those kids. Or Truth. You're just using them. Truth wanted to go pro, goddamn it. For all my boys. Yeah, right. Get on out of my house. [TIRES SCREECHING] What, are you on drugs? Whoa! Wait, Truth. Why'd you run today, huh? It's his fault, Byron. Boo! Where's your Matthew? Matthew? Yeah. You better hide, motherfucker. I'll kick his ass one-on-one. He'll bury you. I'll break his heart just looking at him. Yeah, let's see what you got, huh? You wanna see what I got? Yeah. Lock your door, boy. Put your seatbelt on. Come on. Come on get in the car. [BOTTLE CLINKS] I'm gonna play again, Zack. You're gonna be my first comp in three years. Wrong. You gonna play me. I'm gonna light you up, pussy. You always was a joke. Well, let's play ball then. I don't know what to-- [♪♪♪] [HEAVY BREATHING] [STRAINING] [GRUNTS] [GLASS SHATTERS] What the fuck is wrong with you? No, I ain't finished with him. I ain't finished you with, mother-- It's all right. Let's go. Let's go. No mas. No mas. Matthew... I'm sorry. You betrayed me, man. Betrayed me. ZACK: The game is so pure and so clean and so straight up. And there I was using Matthew to get back at Byron and Truth. Byron? It'll kill me if Truth ever goes back to the streets. You'll take care of him, you will. Good morning, Zachary. Hey. Zack... I've been dreaming about Truth going pro so long, the closer it got, I kind of got drunk on the dream. Byron, I-- I had no right to say what I said last night. We both said some pretty silly stuff. It ain't no problem. Now I know Truth needs more school to mature. Tests all year, too. The boy needs to be tested all year to make sure he's clean. I agree. Let's talk to Truth. Let's do it. Truth, are you sure you don't want anything to eat? Yeah, I'm sure. Truth, we got some personal stuff to discuss. About next year. I'm going back to school. When did you decide that? Talked to Coach Beverly today. Told him I don't wanna go pro. Well, I bet he jumped for joy. He said he wants to talk to me face-to-face. He's gonna come to the "Byron Talent Show." Another year of college, Truth, you're just gonna get better. It'll give you a whole lot of experience, Truth. You'll be more valuable. Yeah. As long as I'm scoring them double digits in school, they love me. With a few minor adjustments, I think we could be contenders again. Save your hype, coach. Truth's gonna finish college. Well, let's talk about that. Now, son, I want you back in my program. But there's one condition. I want you to get some therapy. Therapy? I'm talking about psychological counseling. See, you've been a disruptive influence. Disruptive? You're not capable of playing within a team concept. I carried your tired team. Truth-- Because of your selfish play, you took teammates out of the flow of the game. Fuck that! They punked out at crunch time. We lost the conference final. I don't need that. Well, I don't need you, cracker-face. Wait, Truth, let's just-- And I don't need you neither, gray-boy. Why don't you all order up some cherry wine and suck your motherfucking selves off? I'm out of here. I'm my own man. Shit, you don't need me. [DOOR CLOSES] [♪♪♪] Truth, I'm glad I tracked you down. I ain't ready to go pro. All right? That's fine. But I think you should know that... when Byron shipped you to your school he collected $10,000. Mr. Racine asked me to tell you. I'm sorry. Come see us. TRUTH: I love basketball. It's all I got. I'll do whatever I got to do. Mold myself to fit any team. Be mature, you know. I'm ready. Okay, Truth. I want you to sign right here, okay? Stay. Very good. So, um, when do I start doing commercials? We'll be setting those up for you any day now. My date with the Virgin Mary? When I... She'll wait. Until you clean up. Clean up? I'll take my signing bonus now, right? Uh, Byron said I'll be getting about 100,000. After you've done 90 days in the drug rehab of my choice. I ain't going to no junkyard, man. Man, I'm primetime scorer. I score on anybody, any time, any place. Scoring is not enough. Right now, all you can score is some funny shit. Right now you are damaged goods. I can't sell damaged goods. Damaged goods, man? I'm the Truth. Truth Harrison, man. You are checking in tonight. Before you kill yourself. [♪♪♪] [CROWD CHEERING] ♪ Pump it up Pump, pump, pump it up ♪ ♪ Pump it up Come on pump it up ♪ ♪ Pump, pump, pump it up ♪ [♪♪♪] Coach Walker, didn't think you were gonna make it. Oh, you know I was gonna make it. How you doing, coach? Fantastic. Byron. Nice tan, coach How's the wife? Byron, how are you? By, let me run for the coaches. Come on now, one last chance to get on my feet. Get. Case. What's up, man? Yo, Caseman, now what's up, man? So, what's the deal? Is Byron gonna let you run? Yeah, man. All I gotta do is re-learn the program. What? Next year, though. You know. Next year. He's got brains. That's what I like about him. He plays with his head and-- Truth! This is Truth Harrison. Super-- That superstar shit is weak. You sold me out, Byron. No, no. He's joking, coach. You're the joke. I'm paying your rent. Yeah, David Racine told me. I'll call the whole show off, anything, son. Just come with me for help. Truth! Truth! Truth! [CROWD GASPS] Without me, you'd be dealing punks for chump-change, motherfucker. ZACK: All Truth grabbed was Byron's scalping money. Hell, he had cash everywhere, not just in his socks. Tickets are a liquid sort of business. But Byron wasn't a flesh peddler. He never sold Truth. He never sold anybody. Welcome. These are the stars of the future. Don't blink... or you might miss your next All-American. [GASPING] [GROANING] [YELLING] Those people didn't love Truth. They really didn't care that he was born in hell. Or that he got beat up every day as a kid. And that he didn't have a father. Byron, he had a father. I'm leaving Cabrini, Zack. I don't have the strength no more. ZACK: It hurt when Truth died. But it hurt me almost as much to see Byron dying inside. I wanted the old Byron back. If he went down, who was gonna be the guardian angel? RACINE: By releasing our clients' instructional video, together with her fashion line. We project a tremendous market rub-off. Creating a profit synergy-- Where were you, asshole? Didn't you care? Or was Truth just another piece of meat you put on your fucking shelf? Of course I care. If you or any of your flunkies here come near my playground and try talking to my boys, I'm gonna fuck you up. As a matter of fact, soon as this meeting is over, I'm going down to that public playground and I'm going to offer-- You can expect to see a restraining order. And after that, I'm going to institute proceedings to have you disbarred. On what grounds? Start with professional misconduct. Because you can't compete. Gentlemen, will you throw this trash out of here? Asshole. Get him off of me. Get him off me. He, said, "Get him off me." Get him off me. Do you think I hurt my chances of getting a job there, Byron? MAN: Byron? Otis Winston. Otis the Elevator? Yeah, yeah, Byron. Yeah. Oh, man. Zack... That boy could get up and stay up. Serious hang time. I got him 15 rides. The boy didn't want to go on none of them. Need some help? Matthew, you got a gift from God, son. I'm not your next Truth. I know. I'm just saying that your talent is so strong, if you don't turn it loose, it's gonna turn on you. And one way or another, you're gonna die. Who are you guys telling me about my life? Look, you bought all the expectations: I gotta score 40 points every night. I gotta be a hero. Just play for yourself, for fun. I'm not ever playing again. Matthew... What're you gonna do? Stay in that cave forever? My Breds will be running against Zack's Stars tomorrow. Yeah, and we're thinking you come down and play for my guys, all right? Give them a lift, you know? Kick some butt, have some fun. What do you say? Why don't you guys just leave me alone? [♪♪♪] Hey, J.J., you beat them by 50 last time. You lazy? They got better. Crank it up a notch. Don't give up, Stars. Keep your heart in the game. Let's go. [GRUNTS] Man, look at those Stars. Y'all garbage, man. Y'all can't play. All right, let's get back on D next time. We should have scored. Man, we have three on one. Man, they're making us look like fools. Damn, let's quit now. No. Byron, time out! Huddle up, guys. Bring it in. Bring it in. Now, you're playing against a great team out here. And you're holding your own. You called time out to tell us that? Man, come on, what's up? That's a crock of shit. Guys, just stay with me. Listen. This game is won in two places Here, and here. Now play for yourselves and play for each other. 20 more minutes with pride and this whole neighborhood will know who you are. All right? Come on, now. You know, you're like our Byron, man. Guys, listen. Bullshit! On three. One, two, three. ALL: Bullshit! Let's go! Come on! Come on, Andre. Lead them. Come on, man. Man! Caseman, you all right? Yeah, yeah, I'm okay, man. Come on, Case. How is it, Case? Ain't nothing, Byron. What you gonna do, Zack? You need five to play here. We'll run with four. Give me five or go home. You're getting off lucky too, punk. Byron? House rules. Good game, good game. All right. [CROWD BOOING] It's over. Shit! We're not gonna talk about it, we're gonna do it. Let's play ball. What, are you scared? PLAYER: Come on, man, it's your world! ZACK: You're open, shoot! ANDRE: Take a J, Case. MATTHEW: Shoot it! Shoot it! [CHEERING] All right! They were saved by the rain. [BREDS GRUMBLING] Yeah, no more giving each other crap. Let's call UCLA, Byron. I'm ready for a big-time program, now. Big-time classes too, Matthew. You're gonna be booking it. Yeah! Nice shot, Caseman. Oh, yeah, I've been working on that, man. ZACK: Byron was a changed man. No more running down the Shooting Stars and giving his time to only the most talented. He had a whole new program. All right, Caseman. When you get to Frisco, look for Alaskan Airlines. Don't be drinking none. Watch your language on the court. Hit them books. I want to see a diploma. Play tough defense. And don't kiss up on the coach's daughter. You got your life back together? Yeah. I feel nice, Byron. I ain't gonna let you down neither, man. Continue to study hard, work on that jumper. All right, Caseman. You got my number. Use it. Tear ass. Alaska better be ready, because the Caseman is coming. And I'm all about business. Coach? Byron here. I'm sending you Casey Caldwell, this unbelievable, wiry, quick-leaping, sharpshooter. Yeah, he's a city ball player, but Coach, he loves the country. Horses, flowers, everything. In fact, Coach, he plans to settle down in Alaska one day. And open up a barber shop, cut heads. I don't know why you're leaving now. We'd make a great team, we wouldn't need no Racine. Zachary, we'll be partners. Me and you at the playground. Huh? I gotta go home. All right. Gotta get my gear and come on back. You're bullshitting? I wouldn't lie to you, Byron. What are we waiting for, huh? Let's go for a ride in the country? All right. Zachary, it's starting all over again. So much basketball. So many kids. I wanna ship my whole park off to college before I'm done. I thought you said we were partners? Okay, before we're done. ZACK: They say basketball is like life. But it's more. It's what life could be. Yeah, it's more than a game.
