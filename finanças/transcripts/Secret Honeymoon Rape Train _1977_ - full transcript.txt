Shall we go? Don’t move! I don’t want to hurt you! Be a good boy. Is he going to kill us? Cops! Cops! You are under arrest! Do you promise to be true to Akiko Nakamura... in good times and in bad, in sickness and in health? I do. Akiko Nakamura, do you promise to be true to... Excuse us. We are the police. The police? Did you see two young guys enter this building? Such a beautiful bride. I am happy for you, Akiko. - Everyone! - Thank you. Can I steal away the beautiful bride now? I want to be alone with her. Let’s get out. Best wishes. Thank you. Don't. Why now? This is the time! Don't. Don't! Why here? This is the place! No... No. No! No! No! Look this way. The reception at the hotel is ready. Come right after redoing your makeup. He is injured. Can you drive? Where are we headed? As far away from Tokyo as possible. - But I… - Just drive! Sorry. It’s all because he can’t drive. Can't you drive smoothly? I'm not good at this! It’s okay. Speed up! Are you OK? The road is blocked. Go left! Turn left! Hey! Are you OK? How’s your injury? Pull yourself together! It's no use! It's hopeless. I am fine. Just leave. I will release you later. I promise. Is this train running? Yes, it seems it is. We made quite a scene. Quite a scene, wasn't it? Sorry about that, Ms. Bride. Hey... Where is this train heading? Shit! I've gotten thirsty all of a sudden. Aren't you cold? If you are, put this on. I know you are pretending to sleep. I'm not. I feel really sorry for getting you involved in this mess. This is all your husband’s fault. He is from a rich family. Are you from a rich family too? No. When are you going to stop running? You should show your injury to a doctor. The two criminals who ran away with the valuables... from the stolen car have been identified... and the Prefectural Police has placed them on the wanted list. We don’t know where they are heading yet. Arresting them is just a matter of time. Fuyuhiko Yamada, 24 Haruo Suzuki, 22 And now other news... How much? This is the end of the news for the hour. And today’s weather forecast shows winds from north... a somewhat cloudy sky, and the mountains will experience a bit of rain. Tomorrow’s forecast is wind from north, cloudy and fair in some areas. This is the end of the weather forecast. Good morning! It’s time for the Wednesday morning exercise! Let’s enjoy it together before work! You’d better not scream. You don’t want others to see you like this, do you? Don’t tell anyone about me. I won’t tell anyone about you either. No! Let me go! You're hungry, aren’t you? What do you want? An egg? Juice? Juice, please. You should have some too. The money wasn't enough, so this was all I could buy. I'm not hungry. Put it on. It’s a present. For me? You can't look like you're in the middle of a wedding ceremony forever. Akiko Nakamura’s fingerprints were found in the car... abandoned around Kamagami-cho, Tsurukawa. The police assume that the two criminals kidnapped the missing woman. We still have some juice left. Water. I need water. We need to do something. Water! She's gone. It’s too late to look for her, isn’t it? I think she is with the cops now. Can you stand up? What’s is it? Hey! Hey! 500 yen for 10 pieces. Sorry, I don't have any money. Huh?! Please give them to me. Mister, what can I do to make you give them to me? Hey! Run away! Just abandon me! It's me. Open up! Where did you go? How did you get it? It’s a present. A cigarette, please. Hey, why didn’t you run away? Let me go into town. I join you. I want to help you. Let’s just give up. You can't do it. Why? I can do it! We need to talk. Please follow me. We don’t want to make a big deal out of this. You don’t want to get cops involved in this either, do you? If there's something you haven’t shown us yet, please do so now. Otherwise, I will search you. Manager, we have no choice. Right. Don’t touch me! Are you okay with filing a police report? No choice. Please wait! You might have put small things in here. Some people put things in here as well. Stop! No! You’d better not scream! You don’t want to go to the police, do you? If you don’t, be a good girl, okay? Who are you? I'm her older brother. What the hell is this? Actually, this is… Akiko! Call the police! Wait a minute! Stop it! Did they do anything to you? Don’t do things like that anymore. Got it? Go first. Got it? This is bad! The train is gone. What should we do? Let’s talk to the station staff about the train schedules. Go sleep. We can only change trains in the morning. I need to go to the toilet. You must be the bride who disappeared from the church. That's the guy you were with, isn’t he? I will tell the boss right away. Bride Missing - Unable to Trace Two Men Wait here, got it? You… What are you doing? She knew about me. She will tell others. What should we do? We'll be in trouble if she talks. Close your eyes for now. Don’t tell anyone about us. Got it? Got it? Got it? Got it? It’s the police! Wake up! I guess the pain must be gone by now. Yes. The wound must have gotten worse. How come? I heard it doesn’t hurt when the wound gets worse. It smells. A cigarette, please. I go buy some for you. Don’t miss the train again. Wipe his body with this. Hey, let me see your body too. When I was alone, I was only thinking about you. Hey, show me. Come here. What’s up? Come in. Hey. Let me join you one more time. Don’t. You will get in trouble again. I will be fine this time. Hey, let’s go. “Sorry” is not enough! What will you do about it? It’s important to me! There is a bar I usually go to. Would you like to go there? Let’s go! Let’s go! Hold on tight! You were the ones who did it, weren’t you? Anyway, give me the money for treatment. Unfortunately, I don’t have a penny. This party is for shutting down the bar. Are you really okay? You have been through a lot. It’s nothing. I can take worse than this as long as I can follow you guys. Let’s separate. You’d better go back! I'm not kidding! Are you okay with becoming like us? Go! Get out. Hey! Where are you heading? I can give you a ride. You are surrounded! Stop resisting! Come out immediately! According to the employee here, the two guys are identified as… You are surrounded! Stop resisting! Come out immediately! Hey! Where are you heading? It’s okay. Stop the car. Just tell me. I can give you a ride. Thank you. You are surrounded! Stop resisting! Come out immediately! You are surrounded! Stop resisting! - Come out immediately! - How are you? The End
