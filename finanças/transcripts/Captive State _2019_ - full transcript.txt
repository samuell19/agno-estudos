Commissioner Igoe is ready for you. They're bringing in hunters this time - from off planet. - They can't do that. The one I.D. we have... the ex-priest from Saint Anthony's... points to Pilsen. You know what that means. We can clean this up ourselves. Yeah, nobody's talking about a cleanup. Pilsen isn't Wicker Park, Commissioner. - Yeah, not yet. - They torch this neighborhood, the network will go to ground just like they did last time. You know, you're too sentimental, Bill. Pilsen's a goddamn armpit. Only good for whoring. Their leadership is in Pilsen. - You know that for a fact? - I'm working on it. Not fast enough. If we do our job, we can locate the end of the thread, their Number One, and unravel the whole network. Look, let me stop you right there. Hey, that ship has sailed. And I have to explain why to them in there. I got a positive I.D. at Soldier Field, the man I've been tracking for two years. I need time to bring him in alive. You're not listening. Right now, we have resources behind us. Now, you might not see them, but they're there. They're protecting you. And the more irrational you become, the more unnecessary noise you make, the harder it's gonna be to invite you into the lifeboat. Do you understand me? If there's any chance of getting off this dying rock, I'm not gonna waste it. Pilsen is already dead. They just don't know it yet.
