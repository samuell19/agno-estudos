Are you Jonathan? That's me. Let's go. Do you do this a lot? What's that? Call that number, go out with random girls like me. No. This was my first time. I didn't think people called hotlines anymore. Figured I'd be the only one on the phone. Do you think it was worth it? Sure. It's good to meet cool people like you. Have you called the number before? A few times. So you've been on a lot of dates like this? If I told you I'd been on a lot of these kind of dates, you might get the wrong impression. What's the impression? That I'm a slut. No. Don't say that. There's nothing wrong with being a sl-- I mean, wanting to make new friends, that's all we're doing here, right? It seems like you're very uncomfortable. Like you don't want to be here. I... I'm happy to be here. We're having a great time. I apologize for making you feel uncomfortable tonight. That wasn't my intention. You want to get out of here? So where are we going next? Figured I'd be a gentleman and get you home early. No, I don't... I don't want to go there. I don't want to be in that house with all those people, you know? We can go to the movies. Well, can't really get to know you in the movies. Why don't we go to your place? Hey, you can't smoke in here. Why? Manager's rules. You want a drag? I quit. I don't smoke anymore. Well, I hope you didn't quit everything, because that would be really fucking boring. You like it? Yeah. Just... You know, quick drawing. Nobody's ever drawn me before. Which part of me do you want to draw next? The front... or the back? Maybe we should pick this up another time. What's the matter? Are you scared of me, Jonathan? Don't you like my body? Look at me. Look at me. Do you like my body? Yes. Well, what is it, then? I'm not good enough for you? Is that it? I... I just... I shouldn't be doing any of this. It's... It's not a good idea. This was your idea. You called the number, remember? You said you wanted to fuck a girl like me. Isn't that what you said? I don't know. You said you wanted it like this. Right here. Say it. Say, "I want this to happen." I want this to happen. Say it again. I want this to happen. Thank you, sweetie. Ringworm, scabies, herpes. Dude, it could be anything, to be honest. Oh, shit. - You do not wanna see this. - What is it? What is it, man? Dude, what-- -I can't even pronounce it. Chill out. Okay, do you realize that you paid three bucks a minute... for a fucking STD? You know that, right? You don't know it's an STD. I mean, it could be poison ivy. I just didn't know you could get poison ivy from vaginas. Maybe it's poison oak. Or just an allergic reaction. I-I don't know. Maybe it was the fried chicken. I don't fucking know, dude. It wouldn't grow this fast if it was an STD. Or maybe you barebacked a disgusting phone skank and you did not use protection. She wasn't a skank at all. She was actually really sweet, and pretty, and really interesting and... So, a sweet and cute and interesting phone skank. Got it. People have unprotected sex all the time and nothing happens. Dude, it fucking burns. You need to see a doctor, like, now. I'm not going to the doctors. You know I hate doctors. You're going to infect the whole store with that shit and I'm not going to allow that kind of health violation, not in my store, not on my watch. You're smoking weed in the cooler, talking about health violations. I'm serious, man. You're not working today. And you're gonna go get your shit fixed, or don't come back. I'm telling you this as your friend. And more importantly, as your shift manager. Now get your dirty dick out of here. And how long do you say you've had it? I just got it this morning. All right. - Mostly concentrated in this area? - Yes. Okay I'm gonna apply some pressure on a few areas. I want you to tell me if you feel anything unusual. All right. You feel a sharp pain right here, though? - Anything? - Just burns. Is the rash radiating down your genitals? - Yeah. - Okay. - And you said you penetrated your partner without a condom? - Yeah. So, first I'm gonna tell you this: don't do that. It's a bad idea. All right. What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take a small sample here. Great. I can't diagnose you right now, but I can tell you I'm not concerned. I see these kinds of things all the time. Patients come back a few days later, and it's gone. Don't you think this rash is pretty bad to get after, like, 12 hours? After unprotected sex? Yeah, it's not ideal. All right? What I can tell you is, it blisters a lot like herpes, but it's happening a lot quicker. So I have herpes? We will not know anything until the lab results come back in. How long is that gonna take? Two days, maybe three. Can't we get the results sooner? Look, I looked on the Internet, and it could be a number of things. Ringworm, syphilis, cancer, MS, poison oak. Is the Internet your doctor? No. I am. What I would do is, I would track down your partner. I'd see if she was exhibiting the same symptoms. She might know exactly what that rash is. In the meantime, you're gonna take this cream. You're gonna apply it three times a day and I'd also invest in some condoms. We're sorry. You have reached a number that has been disconnected or is no longer in service. Hello, sir. I'm looking for Dena. Is she around? - Dena? - Yeah, Dena. Yeah, I don't know a Dena. I picked Dena up at this address last night. 1366 Torrington Road. All these houses look similar. You might wanna go look around. I know it was here. Maybe she goes by another name. Look... This is Dena. All right? She's about 30 years old, really tall, brown hair. I've never seen this woman before. The only people living here are me and my wife and trust me, you didn't pick her up last night. Look, I picked Dena up right out front of this house. She told me she stays here with some other people. Well, maybe you should call your friend and find out what her address is. - Her phone got disconnected. - Yeah, well, that's not my problem. Yo! Get off my property. Now! Sorry to bother you. Hi. I'm Dr. Jason Ronaldi. Every hour, 12 people die from the effects of alcohol and drug abuse. Addiction is a disease, an epidemic that we can control one patient at a time. When I just moved to America, crack became my best friend drug addiction hotline taught me is my worst enemy. Hi. Yes, I called this number a few days ago and I met a girl using this service. I'm looking for some help. I was wondering if you can give me some more information. I don't know, can you look, over the last couple days, first name Dena? I'm not permitted to give anything away to any of our customers. Can you just give me an e-mail address or something? I'm not permitted to release any personal information. What do you not understand? Can I speak to your manager? I am the manager. Is there anything else I can help you with? - No. - All right, then. You have a good evening, Jonathan Marsh. We'll be seeing you real soon. Night... - Another cup of coffee? - No, thanks. Do you remember seeing me here last night? I sat at this table with a woman, dark hair, kinda looked like that. Sorry, honey. It's too many tables. Yo, Eric. Jonathan, where you at? I'm at Jenny's diner. - Are you alone? - Yeah. Listen, you're in trouble. Come over to my place, and I'll explain. What do you mean I'm in trouble? Just get over here now and we can talk, okay? I'm not fucking around, man. I'll be there in five minutes. Eric? Eric, you here? I'm back here! Where you at? In my room! Dude, are you fucking with me? - Eric? - I'm here. Dude, if you're under the bed... Get off! Get off! Get off! Dena. Did you receive any messages... Say it, Jonathan. Say, "I want this to happen." Good morning, Jonathan. How are you doing this morning? Not good. Do you remember talking to me last night? No. Do you remember how you got here? The police? That's right. You're in a bit of trouble right now, and you're gonna be staying here with me until we figure out what's going on with you. Do you understand? Can you tell me why you did this to your friend Eric? All right, this happened last night. - Can you explain this? - I wouldn't do that to Eric. You did this. Hey, pal. All right, Jonathan. Everybody in this room cares about you and wants to see you well. But right now, we're all very concerned about your well-being. According to your parents, you've been exhibiting some very erratic behavior lately. Some might even call it conspiratorial in nature. Can you please tell us why you did this to your friend Eric? I wouldn't attack Eric. S-Somebody jumped me. That's not true. I came home, and you were just standing there, completely catatonic, like-like a zombie, and so I went up to you, and I tried to wake you up. And then you went completely fucking apeshit. I'm sorry for swearing, Mr. and Mrs. Marsh. But I'm just... I'm really frustrated because I've done nothing but help you. Okay? I gave you a job, I've helped you with your social life, I tried to help you get girls the right way. And you do this to me, man? You called me. You said to come over, that I was... That I was in trouble. I didn't call you. Okay? I never called you. Do you see now why we're all concerned about your well-being? - You think I made this up? - Considering your track record, I think your parents have a right to be concerned. One bad day in high school doesn't mean you can throw it in my face the rest of my life. Jonathan, it was more than one bad day, okay? It was a lot of bad days. And... it's happening again. This rash is real, and I want it tested. Toxins, poisons, bacteria, malignant tumors, all of it. Dena wanted to poison me. Jonathan, listen to me. Nobody here wants to poison you, son. - Jonathan? - Hey, kid. Jonathan, come on, wake up, buddy. Come on. Wake up, Jonathan. Jonathan! Wake up, Jonathan. Can you hear me, Jonathan? Give him the full 72 hours. It's gonna be so nice to have you back home again, just where you belong. Doctors don't always know what's best. Sometimes moms know. Oh, my God. - What? - You're bleeding. Oh, shit. Just try to keep it off the upholstery, all right, kiddo? You know what? I'll... Let me take this up to your room and you go clean up your nose, okay? Think of this as vacation. No responsibility, no stress. In a couple of days, you're gonna feel all better. I hope so. Of course you will. How long has he been in there? I don't know. It's been a while. Once he had some razors in there. - Is there anything sharp in there for him to hurt himself? - I don't remember. I'm not the one who goes in the bathroom anymore. We're so happy to have you home. - That looks good, honey. - Oh, you know what, why don't we... Why don't we get those other ones, huh? Less dishes for your mom, kiddo. Here you go. Thank you. Bet it's been a while. Bet it's nice to have a home-cooked meal, huh? Are you serious? Look, I appreciate you guys offering to take care of me the next couple days, but I think it's better if I get my truck and stay at my place. You know what? You're staying with us, all right, for a while. Whatever medications and creams the doctor gave me, I can use at my place. You're not-- You're not going to your place. You're staying with us, okay? There's no discussion. It's my apartment, my truck. Please give me my keys now. Mom, where are my keys? You don't need to be driving, honey. Your dad and I can get you where you need to be. I can get me where I need to be. You know what? You've been driving on expired tags since last year. All right? We don't hear from you in months, and then you just spent 72 hours in a psych ward. Now, you're not getting that truck, and you're not getting that apartment. Nice. Real nice. How is living with my parents supposed to help with stress? I'm embarrassed, you're embarrassed. Let's save each other the trouble here. All right, you know what? Dr. Ronaldi doesn't think you're fit to live by yourself. - Fuck Dr. Ronaldi. - That's great. We can't afford to keep paying half your rent while you figure your life out. Figure my life out? What do you think I'm doing? I've been figuring it out. I'm following every fucking step in this book that you guys gave me. This "figuring your life out" book that you guys gave me. What more can I do? I work 60 hours a week. Oh, yeah, and we're so proud of your accomplishments at that liquor store. - Honey. - No, no, honey, no. No. You know what? He needs to hear this. All right? His friends are starting careers, and he can't figure out how to pay car insurance. You guys want me to be better? Believe me, this is real. Dena was real. I should get support from my parents! P.S. It's not a liquor store. It's a lifestyle convenience boutique. That's awesome. Pick up the phone and call the all-night party line. Sexy singles in your neighborhood are looking to get in touch with you. What are you waiting for? Call 1-900... Jonathan? Dad, we have to go. We need to leave right now. It's here. It's here for me.

Hold him. - Shut it. - Slut! -Now just open your mouth. It's okay. No, Jonathan! Stop! Stop! Stop! Jonathan, I'm sorry. I can't let you in here. Look, I just need to grab a couple things. I need shoes. I need money. Please. I've been instructed to call the police if you try and enter your apartment. Eric, I need to talk to you! Excuse me, sir? I-I don't mean to bother you. I just, lost my phone and wallet last night. Is there any way you can spare any money? I'd really appreciate it. - Sorry. - No problem, man. Excuse me? Sir? Excuse me. I don't mean to bother you. This is really embarrassing, but any chance you have a couple of dollars you can lend me? I just need to make a phone call. How much you need? Just... A couple of dollars would be great. Okay. Okay. You're not gonna buy liquor with this, are you? No, I... I don't drink. You gonna get high? No, I'm just... This is really embarrassing. I'd pay you back if I could. I just... - I just need to make a phone call. - Okay. Here's your fucking money. What was that? You remember me now? Yeah, you tried to punk me in front of my girlfriend. "What size condoms do you wear? You want the piña colada?" What are you, some kind of fucking stand-up comedian? Man, you were in my store. I wasn't trying to punk you. I was trying to help. Yeah, why don't you help yourself by getting some fucking shoes? All right? And if I ever run into you again, and I see you eye-fucking my girlfriend like that, I'm gonna beat the fuck out of your little crackhead ass. All right? Take your money. I don't need it. Are you serious right now, dude? Are you fucking serious right now? You wanna go? You wanna go, motherfucker? You see, I'm an alpha male, and you are my bitch. - Break it up! - All right? Hey! Break it up! Break it up! This guy's accosting your customers, man. Hey, you can't-- You get out of here. Okay? You can't beg for money on my property. I'm not begging. I'm a paying customer. - I know how it works. - You go now. Okay? I call the police. Hey, nobody wants you, all right? Get your crackhead ass out of here. You see this? Oh, yeah. It's all over you. I hope your girlfriend likes it when your dick falls off. Cocksucker. What the fuck was that? You should go to a doctor, man. Hey, man, what was that? No, for real, what was that? Dude, what the fuck was that? Hey. Hello, there. Hello-- Hey, what was that, dude? Some guy. Yo, you've reached the ERC. Leave a message after the beep. Holy shit. "Are you experiencing sudden bad luck, illness, addiction, heartache, or feeling persistent evil? "Let me destroy the evil before the evil destroys you." Hey. No shoes, no service. If you can make an exception... I'd really like to speak to this lady. Are you fucked up? No. Look, I just really wanna talk to Ms. Melinda. What do you wanna talk to Melinda about? Well, I'm experiencing everything the flier says. Bad luck, illness, feeling persistent evil. The day I got this rash, Melinda was watching me at Jenny's diner. Why would Melinda be watching me the same day all this shit started? There's no way this is a coincidence. Please. Wait here. There's a guy here to see you. - Yeah, what does he want? - He's got a rash. Can we trust him? Does he have money? I don't know. He says he met you in a diner. He's got a rash on his arm. How big is the rash? What is his... - Yeah. - I'll give him this. Give him the... You need this. Well, it's not free. How much? How badly you want help? That's all I got. Give me your watch. Spiritual defense safety kit? Level three. - What do I do with this? - It's just to get you started. Melinda will meet with you at Blue High Shack. - You know where that is? - Yeah. - 6:00 p.m. Don't be late. - Why can't we just meet here? No, we don't bring that kind of shit into our store. It's bad energy, dude. Did you bring anybody here with you? No, it's just me. I don't want any bullshit. Do you understand me? - I said, do you understand me? - Yes. Yes, I do. Show me your rash, Jonathan. What do you think it is? Poison. This is worse than poison. We have work to do. It doesn't matter how much money they have, how nice they smell. Doesn't matter. They're vile. They're filth. You've already been to the house. You know who you're dealing with. What is this? It's the start of the cleansing process. If you have what I had, time is not on your side. The solution is to make... Spread it out. They tried to seed you with that woman. If it took root, you'll find it just under these scabs. - Find what? - You'll see. It's not that far beneath your skin. Dig all of it out. Dig it all out. Stay focused. Stay focused. Oh, God! Oh, God! Don't stop until it's all out. Don't leave the circle. Don't leave the circle. Don't leave the circle. Don't leave the circle. Don't leave the circle. Jonathan. Hello? Hey. Hey, you. You okay? You all right? Shit. Where is she? - Where are you going? - I need to talk to Melinda. -No. You can't go-- -She owes me. - You can't go in there! - I don't care. - Winter! Winter! - Get out! - Get out! - It's okay. I'll handle this. I'll handle it. What can I do for you, Jonathan? What happened last night? What did you do to me? You started the cleansing process. It's what you wanted. It's what you need. Explain to me what I saw. I pulled black shit out of my arm. In the morning, it was gone. You saw everything you needed to see with your own eyes. You know exactly what's going on. That is the problem. I have no idea what's happening. - Help me. - I gave you everything you need to help yourself. If you're too stupid to figure this out, then you deserve what's coming. I know your fragile mind can't handle this, Jonathan. But there are evil forces out there. Forces sent to kill you. If you want answers, go back to that house. See for yourself what they're doing to people in there. Hello. We are not available now. Please leave your name and phone number after the beep. We will return your call. Mom, it's me. I'm sorry about what happened. I didn't mean to hurt you guys, but I just need you to understand. I know what's happening to me. It's... something I'm going to fix. By myself. If you or Dad don't hear from me soon... I love you. Dena. Oh, God. They... They... They... used me. They used you for what? For what? Fucking Melinda was right. They're fucking witches. Oh, fuck! Fuck. Shit. Shit! Stop! Don't leave me here! Just tell me how to stop this. How do I stop this? I'm sorry. Fine. What are you doing in my house? Don't know who Dena is? Tell me who's upstairs. Who's half-dead in the bedroom? Listen, son, I'm gonna call the cops. You can tell them whatever story you want to. You fucking liars. How about I call the cops? I'll tell them Dena's upstairs. I'll tell them your fucked-up cult is sacrificing people. I'll tell them what you did to me. I don't know who Dena is. I don't know anything about a cult. You better put that knife down before you get yourself in worse trouble. You don't even fucking think about touching me. Yeah? The cops are gonna find you, and they're gonna throw you in jail for a very long time. No. They're gonna find you. You're fucking crazy. Eric! Eric! - Eric! - Holy shit. What the hell are you doing here? Everybody's been looking for you. I know you and I haven't fixed what went wrong at your house the other night. I'm really sorry for flipping out, but as your best friend, I'm telling you I need help. Okay. I'm here for you. Whatever you need. Look, I know this doesn't look good, all right? And I'm this close to getting in big fucking trouble, but I had to figure it out. Why me? Why am I sick? Why am I all fucked up? What'd you find? Witches, man. Witches. Using black magic. It's real, and it's all happening at 1366 Torrington Road just like I always said. Wait, you think... - You think witches are doing this? - Yes. Look, this coven, they sent Dena out to fucking find suckers like me. And here I am, all right? Look at me. Now they're gonna sacrifice me. They're gonna kill me! Wait. They're trying to kill you? Yes. Dena infected me, all right? She marked me. And now they're coming for their harvest, all right? I pulled some of it out. Look, right here. Black string, dude. It's in there. But the doctors never looked for it. You cut your arm open, dude? Yeah. With this. I mean, but I had to. I-I had to pull it out. I need you to come with me, all right? I need a witness. They won't believe me by myself. Just come with me. Will you come with me? Yeah. Of course, man. Look, I know you think I'm crazy. I mean, I would think I'm crazy. But I'm not, all right? We have to get them to remove the curse now and if they don't... If they don't remove the curse, what? Then I have to... destroy them. What do you mean you have to destroy them? - What does that mean? - You know. Wow. Shit, man. Okay. Okay. Okay, place is still open. I gotta close up. All right? So why don't you go wash up, eat some snacks, then we'll go find these people and we'll talk to them. You promise? Scout's honor. Sounds crazy, doesn't it? To be honest, a little bit. I got you, man. Dig all of it out. Dig it all out. Mrs. Everly. Isabella. What are you doing here? What's wrong with your arm? Oh, nothing. It was an accident. Sorry, I have to go. Why are the cops here? Dude, you've been missing for three days. Your parents are worried about you. We all are. Tell them everything is okay in here. I'll go out the back door. Dude, I called them, okay? You need help. This is for your own good, man. -Just please-- -You dumb shit! Yo! Yo! Jonathan! Hey, you put that knife away, man. Jonathan. Hey! Yo, Jonathan! Put the knife down. Look, I know where her dead body is. - 1366 Torrington Road. - Put the knife on the ground. I'll surrender! If you just take me to that house. I'm not fucking resisting. I'm on your team. Blue Lives Matter. Hands up. Don't shoot! Just take me to that fucking house, please! - Yo, put that knife down. They're gonna shoot you, bro. - Goddamn! Stop! Put the knife on the ground. If you put the knife down, they won't shoot you. Why did you fucking call them? Come on. - Hey, hey, shut up, man. - I'm not a criminal. I'm not-- I'm not a criminal. Give me your hand. They're gonna kill me! Fuck! Let me out! End of the road. - You're gonna be okay. - Right arm. What are you doing? Are you taking any drugs or medication? Jonathan, do you hear me? - How's his pulse? - Pulse is 170, satting at 98. You're going to feel a prick. - No touching. No touching. - No. No. - Hey, it was in my bedroom... - Settle down. - ...and now it's fucking gone. - Stop. No. No touching. Now what do you think you're doing? This is a level-three safety circle. It's protecting me from things you can't comprehend. You know the rules. You're gonna have to clean that up. I don't want anybody coming in here and fucking with my circle. Oh, I don't intend to mess with your little Dungeons and Dragons voodoo anti-curse spell. You can tell Dr. Ronaldi all about it. - Now? - Right now. Let's go. You know, Jonathan, I have to admit I'm a little bit disappointed. You failed your drug and alcohol test. Marijuana, cocaine, ketamine. That's not possible. It's all right here. - How've you been feeling the past couple of days? - Like crap. But now you're gonna blame everything on that bullshit drug test. Forget about the drug test for now and concentrate on what we can control in here. You don't feel the medications are working or at least helping? No. I don't. I don't think you are. The nurses, the pills, this place, none of it. How's your rash? Tell me about your rash. This? This? Fucking painful. You wanna give me some more creams? Some aloe Vera? Maybe it's just a sunburn. Oh, wait. Maybe the black shit that I've pulled out of it is just a manifestation of my anxieties. - Yeah. That's it, huh? - Do you have to be so aggressive? Oh, my God, instead of playing games like I'm a little kid, tell me what you really think is wrong with me. This is just a simple case of sleep paralysis. I'd say that life stress and substance abuse has triggered a severe psychosis that's gone so far as waking hallucinations. But if you stop listening to this psychic and you start listening to me, your board-certified psychiatrist, you're gonna find that these symptoms are completely treatable. Except for the fact that this is no delusion. I know you can't wrap your little brain around it, but there are witches in this world, and stuff like black magic and fucking demons sent to kill me. You're not dead yet, Jonathan. Look, Jonathan, the only way that you're gonna get out of here is if you stop running and you start facing your problems head-on. Next time this entity attacks you, don't move. See what happens when it approaches. You'll realize it's not real. It just feels real. Do you understand me? I'm gonna die in here. It's gonna be your fault. Don't leave the circle. Hello, Jonathan. How'd you get in here? The same way you did. You're probably confused by all the things that have been happening to you. I'm not confused. I know exactly what's going on. Should I call the cops now? We've already dealt with the police. They weren't interested in me, so let's not waste time. You're not gonna get away with this. I've told everybody what you're doing, what you've done to Dena, what you've implanted in me. They know where you live. You are not remotely capable of comprehending the gravity of what's happening here. Jonathan, if you could see the doors we've opened, the portals we've looked through. Very few people have ever experienced something this... this horrific. But you will, Jonathan. I've got you figured out. That's why you haven't got me yet. Melinda told me. I know everything. Listen to your doctors, Jonathan. Stop running. Dena served her purpose, and now it's time for you to serve yours. Embrace it. Is that a threat? Tonight is going to be special. Nurse! Yo, nurse! Help! This guy's a murderer! He's here! - Calm down, Jonathan. - Call the cops. He's right here! - Calm down. - This is the guy who tried to kill me. - Through Dena. - Who are you talking about? It's all right, buddy. Look around. Look around. He's not here now. He's not here now. He was just right here. All right, buddy. It's okay. It's okay. There's no one here, all right? There's no one here. -So... Hey-- -He's right fucking there, man. Well, he's not here now. Let's get you back to your room, okay? I want to know what his name is and who let him in here. This is bullshit, letting him fuck with me like that in here. I will check the registry for you, but you gotta calm down, dude. Relax. You've been doing good. Don't start going backwards. He said tonight was gonna be special. - That's a threat. That's a goddamn threat. - Hey. Watch your mouth. You know what happens when you talk like that around here. Doesn't matter, Wally. I'm getting the fuck out of here tonight. Hey, a little help now. - Thanks. - What'd you get? Hey, where do you think you're going? Jonathan! Stop! Jonathan, settle down. Someone grab the Haldol. Okay. Okay. I'm good. Please. Please. Please don't. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's gonna be so nice to have you back home, just where you belong. You have my blessing. Say it, Jonathan. Say, "I want this to happen." Do you know why your mom is crying? 'Cause she thinks you're gonna kill yourself. That's why you're in here. This is your last stop, Jon. No. Come on. Relax. Just relax. This isn't real. Take all of it out. Take it all out. Oh, my God! Paging Dr. Cline to 452. Paging Dr. Cline to 452. Paging Dr. Tower. Paging Dr. Tower. Dr. Tower, if you will. Code Red in 347. Hello, Mr. Marsh? Yeah, this is Dr. Ronaldi over at County Psych. There's been an incident involving Jonathan. I need you and Mrs. Marsh to get over here right away. This is something that we should not be discussing over the phone. I just need you to get here as quickly as possible. Hey, you need a ride? Um... Come on, hop in. We'll take you wherever you want to go. Be our good deed for the week. It's okay, sweetie. Come with us. - All right. - All right.
