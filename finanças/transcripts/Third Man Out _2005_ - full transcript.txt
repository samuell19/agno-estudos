DEAD GUY IN A LOCKED ROOM. WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN THE HOSPITAL? YOU DON'T LOOK SICK. I'M NOT THE ONE WHO'S HIRING YOU. DONALD STRACHEY, JOHN RUTKA. HELLO. BYE. SOMEONE TRIED TO KILL HIM. YEAH, I'M NOT SURPRISED. YOU KNOW MY WORK. UNFORTUNATELY. WE'RE ON THE WEB, TOO. THE RUTKA REPORT. WE GET OVER 8,000 HITS A WEEK. I WOULDN'T TOUCH THAT SHIT WITH A 10-FOOT POLE. I'M SURPRISED THEY EVEN LET YOU IN HERE AFTER YOU RUINED DR. POKE'S LIFE. PLEASE. ED POKE WAS THE HEAD OF THE HOSPITAL BOARD, AND THE BIGGEST REST STOP QUEEN ON THE NEW YORK STATE FREE-WAY. AND FOR THAT HE DESERVES TO LOSE HIS JOB AND HIS FAMILY AND EVERYTHING HE'S WORKED FOR, HUH? HE SHOULDN'T HAVE VOTED AGAINST EXPANDING HIV CARE IN THIS HOSPITAL. HE GOT WHAT HE DESERVED. MAYBE YOU DID, TOO. WHAT? BY HAVING SOMEONE BREAK INTO OUR HOME AND SHOOT HIM? IF HE WAS SHOT, THE POLICE ARE INVOLVED. WHAT DO YOU NEED ME FOR? BECAUSE THE COPS COULDN'T CARE LESS ABOUT US FAGGOTS. YOU KNOW THAT. LOOK STRACHEY, I NEED YOUR HELP. YOU'RE THE ONLY GAY PRIVATE EYE IN THE CAPITAL DISTRICT. MAYBE IN ALL OF NEW YORK STATE. I SEE. YOU FIGURED THAT WOULD MAKE ME SYMPATHETIC TO YOUR CASE, IS THAT IT? WELL, YOU FIGURED WRONG. GOOD LUCK WITH YOUR BALLET CAREER. REALLY? HE SAID THAT? WELL, WHAT ELSE DID HE SAY? YEAH? HOLD ON. EXCUSE ME SIR, VISITING HOURS ARE OVER. SIR, IF YOU DON'T LEAVE, I'LL HAVE TO CALL SECURITY. WHERE IS HE? MR. RUTKA CHECKED HIMSELF OUT. ARE YOU A FRIEND? WELL, DID YOU WANNA LEAVE THE FLOWERS? THERE, THAT SHOULD KEEP THE RAIN OUT FOR A WHILE. FOR A WHILE? I THOUGHT YOU SAID THE FIREPLACE WOULD BE FINISHED LAST WEEK? FIXING HOUSES AREN'T AS EASY AS THEY LOOK, YOU KNOW. YOU CAN'T JUST RUSH THE JOB. YOU GOTTA COAX THEM, FINESSE THEM. MAKE THEM FEEL LOVED. MY BILL. LOVED ISN'T EXACTLY HOW I FEEL RIGHT NOW. MORE LIKE SCREWED. HELLO. AH, FOR ME? YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE. HAHAHA. I DIDN'T. WITH THE AMOUNT OF MONEY WE'RE PAYING YOU TO RENOVATE THIS PLACE YOU SHOULD BE BRINGING US FLOWERS. HAVE A NICE NIGHT, BOYS. SEE YOU NEXT WEEK. FOR YOU. LET ME GET THAT. YEAH. DID SHE JUST SAY NEXT WEEK? WHAT HAPPENED TO TOMORROW? WELL, SHE AND BOBBY JOE HAVE A DYKES ON BIKES RALLY IN P-TOWN. YOU KNOW, FIGHT THE RIGHT, THEIR KIND OF THING. AH, SWEETHEART, I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU WANTING TO HIRE WITHIN THE COMMUNITY AND EVERYTHING, BUT MAYBE JUST ONCE, WE COULD GET A CONTRACTOR THAT DOESN'T SEE THE WHOLE WORLD AS ONE BIG GAY PRIDE FLOAT? HMM, NO. WHO'S THE MYSTERY CLIENT? NOBODY SPECIAL. I TURNED IT DOWN. YOU TURNED IT DOWN? YES. HONEY, HAVE YOU LOOKED AT OUR BANK ACCOUNT LATELY? I MEAN, THE HOUSE, THE CAR. WE'RE IN SOME TROUBLE HERE, DONALD. YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO TURN DOWN A JOB. IT WAS JOHN RUTKA. TURN DOWN THE JOB. UHUM. YUP? HELLO DONALD, IT'S JOHN RUTKA. JOHN, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? I WANT FIVE MINUTES OF YOUR TIME, DONALD, TO TALK. THAT'S ALL I ASK. NO, NO, NO. NO, NO, NO. ABSOLUTELY NOT. I REFUSE TO LET THAT EXCUSE FOR A HUMAN BEING SET FOOT IN OUR HOUSE. SWEETHEART, I'LL HANDLE THIS, OKAY? OKAY. JOHN, MAYBE YOU DIDN'T HEAR ME BACK AT THE HOSPITAL WHEN I SAID GOODBYE TO YOU, SO I'M GONNA TRY THIS ONE MORE TIME, ALRIGHT? NICE AND SLOW, HERE WE GO, ARE YOU READY? FUCK OFF. THAT'LL BE THE END OF THE JOHN RUTKA PROBLEM. DONALD STRACHEY IS A SELF-LOATHING HOMOSEXUAL. HE'S A TRAITOR TO THE CAUSE OF GAY RIGHTS. HE HATES HIMSELF SO MUCH FOR BEING GAY, HE DOESN'T CARE IF A GAY MAN IS SHOT TO DEATH IN HIS OWN HOME. DONALD STRACHEY IS A HYPOCRITE, A JUDAS, WHO WOULD HAPPILY WATCH A GAY MAN DIE LIKE A DOG INSTEAD OF HELP HIM FIND JUSTICE. NICELY HANDLED. HOW IS SENATOR GLASSMAN THESE DAYS? HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT? THAT YOU'RE HER CHIEF AIDE? IT'S MY JOB TO KNOW THESE THINGS. SHE'S GOT A GOOD VOTING RECORD IN GAY RIGHTS. I WISH THE REST OF THE STATE SENATE WAS LIKE HER. OH, GOOD. SO, MAYBE YOU WON'T FEEL OBLIGED TO DESTROY HER, AND I'LL GET TO KEEP MY JOB. I DO WHAT I DO FOR THE GOOD OF US ALL. YEAH, YOU'RE A REGULAR MOTHER TERESA. OKAY. TIMMY, I THINK MAYBE YOU NEED TO TAKE DR. WATSON FOR A WALK. I JUST DID. I THINK HE NEEDS TO GO AGAIN. OKAY. EXCUSE ME WHILE I OUT MY DOG FOR THE GOOD OF US ALL. MIND IF I SIT? NO, PLEASE, GO AHEAD. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE, JOHN? THEY LET YOU OUT EARLY ON GOOD BEHAVIOR? IT WASN'T SAFE IN THERE. ANYBODY COULD GET TO ME TO FINISH THE JOB. OH, NOW YOU'RE JUST TEASING ME. HAVE YOU EVER BEEN SHOT, DONALD? AS A MATTER OF FACT, I HAVE. I DIDN'T CARE FOR IT TOO MUCH. NEITHER DID I. BUT THAT DOESN'T MATTER TO YOU, DOES IT? YOU PROBABLY THINK I SHOULD BE SHOT AND KILLED. NO ACTUALLY JOHN, I DON'T. BUT THAT PROBABLY PUTS ME IN VERY EXCLUSIVE COMPANY. YOU THINK I DO MY WEBSITE TO MAKE FRIENDS? YOU THINK I PRINT THE RUTKA REPORT, PAY FOR IT OUT OF MY OWN POCKET SO I CAN GET INVITED TO THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE CHRISTMAS PARTY? NO, DONALD. I DO IT BECAUSE SOMEBODY HAS TO SPEAK UP FOR ALL THE MATTHEW SHEPARDS OUT THERE, FOR ALL THE GAY MEN AND WOMEN WHO ARE BRUTALIZED AND MURDERED EVERYDAY. SOMEBODY HAS TO TAKE A STAND BEFORE RELIGIOUS HYPOCRISY AND HOMOPHOBIA TURN THIS COUNTRY INTO A 21ST CENTURY VERSION OF NAZI GERMANY. BRAVO, JOHN. BRAVO. DID YOU WORK ON THAT SPEECH ALL THE WAY OVER HERE? FUCK YOU, STRACHEY. OH, COME ON, RUTKA. THIS IS ALBANY. IT'S NOT PROVINCETOWN OR WEST HOLLYWOOD OR AN EPISODE OF "WILL & GRACE". THIS IS THE REAL WORLD. MORE GAY MEN LIVE IN THE CLOSET THAN OUT. WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT, IT'S THEIR OWN GODDAMN BUSINESS. THIS IS A NICE PLACE, STRACHEY. THIS RENOV IS COSTING YOU A BIT, HUH? A BIT. YEAH, I BET IT IS. AND I'LL ALSO BET SNAPPING PICTURES OF CHEATING HOUSEWIVES ISN'T EXACTLY PAYING THE BILLS. SO, MAYBE IF YOU WON'T TAKE MY CASE FOR THE CAUSE, YOU'LL TAKE IT FOR THE CASH. SOMEBODY WANTS ME DEAD. MAYBE IT'S SOMEBODY I OUTED WHO WANTS REVENGE OR MAYBE IT'S SOMEBODY WHO'S AFRAID THEY'RE GONNA BE THE NEXT RUTKA REPORT COVER BOY, TRYING TO STOP ME. EITHER WAY I NEED PROTECTION. THAT'S A LOT OF PROTECTION. MY FATHER DIED, LEFT ME SOME MONEY. THERE'S MORE WHERE THAT CAME FROM. WILL YOU DO IT? JOHN, I CAN'T PROTECT YOU 24 HOURS A DAY. ALRIGHT, THE FACT IS, THAT IF SOMEBODY WANTS TO GET TO YOU BAD ENOUGH, THEY'RE GONNA GET TO YOU. THEN FIND OUT WHO IT IS, AND HELP ME STOP HIM. DONALD, PLEASE. I DON'T WANNA DIE LIKE THIS. YOU AREN'T SERIOUS. TIMMY, IF I ONLY WORK FOR PEOPLE I LIKE, WE WOULD STARVE. IT'S NOT ABOUT LIKING ANYBODY. THERE ARE CERTAIN RIGHTS AND THERE ARE CERTAIN WRONGS IN THIS WORLD, AND JOHN RUTKA IS AN ABSOLUTE WRONG. WITH DEEP POCKETS. IN CASE YOU HAVEN'T NOTICED, THIS HOUSE ISN'T GOING TO FIX ITSELF. SO, MAYBE I'LL ASK MY FATHER FOR A LOAN. I'M SORRY? YOUR REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMAN FATHER, THE ONE THAT HASN'T SPOKEN TO YOU SINCE YOU TOOK A JOB ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE? COME ON, I DON'T THINK SO. LOOK, HE JUST WANTS ME TO TAKE A LOOK AT HIS FILES, OKAY? SEE IF I COME UP WITH ANY LEADS, THAT'S IT. THOSE FILES HAVE DESTROYED PEOPLE'S LIVES, DONALD. I JUST DON'T THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT YOU SHOULD BE A PART OF. I'M NOT GONNA BE A PART OF IT. IT'S, IT'S A JOB. WHAT DO YOU SAY? I SAY WE NEED ANOTHER BUCKET. HI THERE, GOOD MORNING. CANDY? YOU KNOW WHO IT IS, YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO. RUTKA, YOU'RE DEAD. YOU GODDAMN FUCKING FAGGOT. I'M GOING TO SHOOT YOU UP WITH AIDS, YOU FUCKING FAGGOT. ANOTHER SATISFIED CUSTOMER. I GET HALF A DOZEN OF THESE CALLS EVERYDAY. DO YOU OWN A GUN, JOHN? NO, BUT NOW THAT ALL THIS HAS HAPPENED, I CAN'T SAY I'M NOT THINKING ABOUT IT. SO ARE YOU ALONE HERE? EDDIE LIVES WITH ME. HE'S AT WORK RIGHT NOW, DOWN AT THE PRINT AND COPY. THAT'S HOW WE GET SUCH A GOOD DEAL ON THE RUTKA REPORT. HE DOES A LITTLE OVERTIME FOR FREE. THEY GIVE US THE PRINT RUN, HALF PRICE. SO, WHY'D YOU LEAVE NEW YORK CITY, JOHN? YOU UH, MISS THE GLAMOUR AND EXCITEMENT OF ALBANY? THIS PLACE BELONGED TO MY PARENTS. MOM DIED A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO AND THEN, WHEN MY FATHER WENT THIS PAST SUMMER, HE LEFT IT TO ME. ALL THESE FOR A SET? YOU EAT A LOT OF THIS SHIT, HUH? CALMS MY NERVES. NOT YOUR TEETH. VERY HIGH-TECH, JOHN. HERE WE GO. WELL ARE YOU GONNA HELP ME UP OR WHAT? DON'T GET ANY IDEAS. SCOUT'S HONOR. THESE ARE MY FILES. ALL THESE BOXES? YEAH. HOW LONG DID IT TAKE YOU TO COME UP WITH THIS MUCH DIRT, RUTKA? YOU CONSIDER GAY SEX DIRT, DONALD? EVEN WHEN YOU'RE DOING IT WITH THAT LITTLE BROOKS BROTHERS HUBBY OF YOURS? HEY, THAT'S DIFFERENT. NOT TO THE RELIGIOUS FANATICS WHO RUN THIS COUNTRY. THEY'RE OBSESSED WITH WHAT WE DO IN BED. HOW'D YOU GET ALL THIS? I HAVE MY SOURCES. HOTEL CLERKS, DELIVERY MEN, A FEW WELL-PLACED BUCKS A MONTH, AND I GET ON-GOING REPORTS OF WHO'S COMING AND GOING. ESPECIALLY COMING. YOU KNOW, THE WAY A DETECTIVE WORKS. BRILLIANT. WHY DON'T YOU PUT IT ALL ON A COMPUTER OR SOMETHING? I DO, BUT COMPUTERS CRASH, HARD DRIVES GET ERASED. YOU CAN'T BEAT A GOOD OLD PAPER TRAIL. SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK? I THINK IT'S A TOXIC WASTE DUMP, RUTKA. THE WHOLE THING SHOULD BE PUT IN AN AIRTIGHT DRUM, BURIED IN THE DESERT. THIS ONE TOOK SOME INGENUITY. CELLPHONE CAMERA ON A TIMER. I HAVE A SERIES OF THESE. RIGHT ON THE DESK IN HIS OFFICE. YOUR GOVERNMENT DOLLARS AT WORK. IS THAT? ASSEMBLYMAN BRUNO SLINGER, JUST TWO HOURS AFTER HE VOTED AGAINST THE DOMESTIC PARTNER BILL. GOD, RUTKA. HE PUTS THE ASS INTO ASSEMBLYMAN, WOULDN'T YOU SAY? IS THAT EDDIE? HE SHOULD STILL BE AT WORK. CALL 911! JOHN! HERE. NOW, DO YOU BELIEVE ME? LET'S NOT JUMP TO ANY CONCLUSIONS. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED. IT COULD BE AN ACCIDENT OR SOMETHING. YEAH? THIS IS NO ACCIDENT. IT'S GAS. I TOLD YOU SOMEBODY WANTS ME DEAD. WE WERE UPSTAIRS. WE HEARD A CRASH. AND MY FRIEND CAME DOWN AND THERE WAS SMOKE AND EVERYTHING WAS BURNING. OKAY. WELL, THE FIRE'S OUT. BUT WE FOUND THIS UNDER THE SOFA. NOW, YOU DO HAVE A PERMIT FOR THIS GUN, MR. RUTKA? NO, HE DOESN'T. BUT I DO. IT'S MINE. HEY, MR. STRACHEY. I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE HERE. YEAH, I STOPPED BY TO CHECK IN ON THE PATIENT AND IT'S A GOOD THING THAT I DID. I MUST HAVE LOST IT DURING THE FIRE. THANK YOU. OKAY. WELL LOOK, THE COPS WILL WANT TO CHECK THIS PLACE OUT. ANY IDEA WHO? OBVIOUSLY SOME TWISTED HOMOPHOBIC PIECE OF SHIT. MY FRIEND MAKES A LOT OF ENEMIES IN HIS LINE OF WORK. HE'S A JOURNALIST. DON'T TELL ME, MOVIE CRITIC. VERY GOOD, COLE. HEY, THANKS A LOT. IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU. YOU BET. LET'S GO. DID YOU LOCK UP THE ATTIC? FUCK THE ATTIC, JOHN. YOU TOLD ME YOU DIDN'T HAVE A GUN. NO. I SAID I DIDN'T OWN A GUN. I BORROWED THIS FROM SOMEBODY AT THE HOSPITAL WHERE I USED TO WORK IN NEW YORK. I WAS MUGGED ONCE. I WANTED SOME PROTECTION. OKAY, WE'RE GONNA GET SOME GROUND RULES STRAIGHT RIGHT NOW, JOHN. YOU WANT MY HELP, YOU STOP BULLSHITTING ME. I'M NOT. AND YOU CONCERN YOURSELF WITH THE FACT THAT SOMEONE JUST TRIED TO FUCKING. SHUT UP. YOU'RE GONNA START BY TELLING ME EXACTLY WHO NEXT MONTH'S RUTKA REPORT COVER BOY IS GONNA BE. I DON'T KNOW. WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU DON'T KNOW? IT'S YOUR GODDAMN WEBSITE. I MEAN, I HADN'T EXACTLY FIGURED IT OUT. I HAD IT NARROWED DOWN TO THREE NAMES BUT I STILL HADN'T DECIDED. ALRIGHT, THEN GO UPSTAIRS AND GET ME THOSE THREE FILES. I'LL GET A HANDLE ON WHO OUR MOST LIKELY SUSPECTS ARE. WHERE ARE YOU GOING? START LOOKING FOR SOME OF THE PIECES OF THIS PUZZLE. YOU KNOW, THE WAY A DETECTIVE WORKS. HELLO. HELLO. EVERYTHING OKAY OVER THERE? OH YEAH. IT'S JUST A SMALL FIRE. IT'S OUT NOW. NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT. THERE'S ALWAYS SOMETHING GOING ON AT THAT HOUSE. YOU KEEP AN EYE ON HIM, DO YOU? YOU A FRIEND OF THEIRS? IN A WAY. WELL, I'M NOT NOSY OR ANYTHING BUT EVER SINCE THEY MOVED IN, THERE'S BEEN SOME PARTY OR SOME MEETING, SOME DANCING GOING ON. PARDON MY FRENCH. I'VE GOT NOTHING AGAINST THOSE TWO GUYS, MIND YOU, BUT IT'S ALWAYS GAY THIS, GAY THAT. GAY, GAY, GAY. ENOUGH ALREADY WITH THE GAY. YOU DIDN'T HAPPEN TO SEE ANYTHING GOING ON OVER THERE TODAY, DID YOU? YOU MEAN BEFORE THE FIRE TRUCKS? YEAH. NO, NO. JUST EDDIE RUNNING BY ON HIS WAY TO WORK, I GUESS. HE USUALLY GOES FIRST THING IN THE MORNING BUT HE MUST HAVE BEEN LATE. ABOUT WHAT TIME WAS THAT? OH, ABOUT AN HOUR AGO, I GUESS. AN HOUR AGO, YOU SURE? YEAH, I'M SURE. I'M OUT HERE FOR ONE HOUR AND 45 MINUTES EVERY MORNING. YOU DON'T GET THIS KIND OF A BODY SITTING IN FRONT OF THE TV AND WATCHING JERRY SPRINGER, YOU KNOW. NO, MA'AM. I GUESS YOU DON'T. YOU SURE IT WAS EDDIE SATIN THOUGH, HUH? SURE. TATTOO, EARRING, LOTS OF MUSCLE. THIS IS ALBANY, MISTER. WE DON'T GET A LOT OF THAT TYPE RUNNING AROUND OUR BACKYARDS. I'M SWEATING LIKE A HOG THIS MORNING. WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME INSIDE? HAVE SOME LEMONADE OR SOMETHING? OH, I'D LOVE TO. THANK YOU. BUT UH, GOT TO WORK. ANOTHER TIME, THEN. I ALWAYS LEAVE THE BACKDOOR UNLOCKED JUST IN CASE. HUH. JESUS CHRIST, DON'T DO THAT. I DON'T LIKE WHEN PEOPLE SNEAK UP ON ME LIKE THAT. YEAH, I DON'T LIKE THAT EITHER, JOHN. I ALSO DON'T LIKE IT WHEN PEOPLE LIE TO ME. WHAT? YOU'RE USING ME. I MAY BE A LOT OF THINGS, BUT I'M NOT A SUCKER. I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. JOHN? MY GOD, ARE YOU OKAY? I SAW THE FIRE TRUCKS LEAVING AND THE SMOKE. I THOUGHT YOU WERE. DEAD? OH COME ON, EDDIE. YOU KNEW HE WAS ALIVE. YOU WERE WATCHING THE WHOLE THING. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? I'VE BEEN AT WORK ALL MORNING. REALLY? YOUR NEIGHBOR SAW YOU RUNNING BY THE HOUSE RIGHT BEFORE THE FIRE STARTED. EDDIE? SHE'S CRAZY. IT WASN'T ME. SHE DESCRIBES YOU TO A TEE, EDDIE. MUSCLES, TATTOO AND AN EARRING. AND I TELL YOU, SHE DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THE KIND OF GIRL THAT LETS A MAN GO BY WITHOUT TAKING A GOOD LOOK. NO, NO. I SWEAR, I'VE BEEN AT WORK. JOHN, YOU BELIEVE ME, RIGHT? RIGHT, BABY? I WOULDN'T HURT YOU. RED COONTS. WHAT'S A RED COONTS? IT'S ONE OF BRUNO SLINGER'S TRICKS. HE LOOKS A LOT LIKE EDDIE. SLINGER MUST HAVE PUT HIM UP TO THIS, TRYING TO FRAME EDDIE. HERE. THERE. SEE? NOW YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE UP AGAINST. I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING. BUT I DO HAVE A COUPLE WAYS OF FINDING OUT. JOHN, I PROMISE YOU. IF YOU ARE RUNNING A NUMBER ON ME, I'M GONNA COME BACK HERE AND STOMP THAT CHECK OF YOURS IN YOUR FOOT. NO ALLISON, IT IS NOT OKAY IF YOU TAKE AN EXTRA DAY DOWN THERE. I NEED YOU BACK HERE NOW. BECAUSE MY HOUSE ISN'T FINISHED YET! HELLO? DONALD! HI, BEAUTIFUL. HOW WAS YOUR WALK? OH, IT'S FINE. FINE. EXCEPT FOR THE END PART WHERE I ALMOST HAD A HEART ATTACK. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? OH, I NEEDED A SOFT TARGET. I FIGURED OUR FIREPLACE WAS GETTING A FACELIFT ANYWAY SO. SO, YOU KILLED THE MANTLE? OH, YEAH. OW, OW. I'M GONNA TAKE THIS DOWN TO KAREN PAYNE AT THE LAB. SHE OWES ME A FAVOR. DONALD, WHAT IS ALL THIS ABOUT? WELL, I'LL BE BACK LATER. IF YOU'RE LUCKY, I'LL BE BRINGING A BOTTLE OF WINE. OOH. ONE SIMPLE WORD OF ADVICE, NEVER MARRY A PRIVATE EYE. COME ON, COME ON. COME ON, COME ON. MR. STRACHEY. DETECTIVE BRADLEY BAILEY, ALBANY POLICE DEPARTMENT. I WONDER IF YOU'D MIND TAKING A LITTLE RIDE WITH ME. YOU LIKE ALBANY, MR. STRACHEY? MATTER OF FACT, I DO. I JUST SETTLED IN TO THE NEW HOUSE. A LOT OF WORK TO DO. UH-HUH. YOU AND UH, YOUR FRIEND. OKAY LOOK, DETECTIVE BAILEY. BOB. YOU CAN CALL ME BOB. THEY ALL CALL ME BOB AROUND HERE. CAN I CALL YOU DONALD? BE MY GUEST. IS THERE SOME REASON WE'RE DRIVING AROUND IN CIRCLES, BOB? ACTUALLY DONALD, THERE IS. I'VE GOT A FEW THINGS I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT AND I THOUGHT THEY WERE BETTER DISCUSSED, YOU KNOW, IN PRIVATE. YOU KNOW, BETWEEN GENTLEMEN. WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND? TELL ME, HOW WELL DO YOU KNOW YOUR CLIENT, JOHN RUTKA? IF YOU KNOW HE'S MY CLIENT THEN YOU ALREADY KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION. I GUESS I DO. AND UH, YOU'RE A MEMBER OF THE GAY COMMUNITY YOURSELF. YOU THINK THAT JOHN RUTKA WOULD HIRE SOMEBODY WHO ISN'T? AN HONEST MAN. THAT'S A RARE QUALITY THESE DAYS. I TRY. SO, YOU'VE NEVER PARTICIPATED IN A CONSPIRACY THAT INVOLVED ARSON AND A FALSE REPORT OF ATTEMPTED MURDER? OKAY, ARE YOU ASKING ME OR ARE YOU CHARGING ME? NEITHER, DONALD. JUST A PLEASANT CHAT BETWEEN GENTLEMEN. SEE, YOU KEEP SAYING THAT, BOB. BUT HOW COME I FEEL LIKE I NEED A LAWYER? I'VE KNOWN JOHN RUTKA MY WHOLE LIFE AND THE ONLY SURE THING I CAN SAY ABOUT HIM IS HE'S AN EXCELLENT LIAR. IN WHAT WAY? ANY WAY HE CAN. MY GOD, FROM THE AGE OF SIX, SEVEN YEARS OLD, HE LIED ABOUT EVERYTHING. FROM HIS CHORES TO HIS HOMEWORK TO WHERE HE WAS GOING AND WHERE HE'D BEEN. HE PRETTY MUCH BROKE HIS MOTHER'S HEART. A LOT OF KIDS LIE, BOB. WHAT MAKES JOHN RUTKA ANY DIFFERENT? HE DIDN'T GROW OUT OF IT. NOVEMBER OF LAST YEAR, HE WAS ARRESTED IN NEW YORK CITY FOR THEFT OF DRUGS AND MEDICAL INSTRUMENTS FROM THE HOSPITAL WHERE HE WORKED AS A NURSE. THE CHARGES WERE DROPPED WHEN HE AGREED TO RESIGN. OKAY, SO HE'S NO CHOIRBOY. THE THING IS, HE WAS ONCE UPON A TIME. HAD A BEAUTIFUL VOICE, TOO. BUT NOW, WHY DOES HE WANT TO CAUSE SO MUCH MISERY FOR PEOPLE? I'D SAY HE'S FIGHTING FOR A CAUSE. WHY DO IT HERE? WHY NOT IN MANHATTAN OR SOMEWHERE ELSE? OKAY. DETECTIVE BAILEY, WHY ARE WE TALKING? JOHN RUTKA AND EDWARD SATIN WILL END UP IN JAIL IF THEY STAY IN ALBANY. I WANT YOU TO TALK THEM INTO LEAVING TOWN. ALBANY IS THEIR HOME. I DOUBT THEY'LL GO. THEY LEAVE, I CAN LET SOME THINGS SLIDE. YOU KNOW, I'VE TALKED TO THE GOOD FOLKS OVER AT PRINT AND COPY WHERE EDDIE WORKS. LET ME GUESS, IT WAS HIS DAY OFF. YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE ON THE CASE, DONALD. JOHN RUTKA HAS BEEN A LIAR HIS WHOLE LIFE AND I KNOW HE'S LYING NOW. YOU THINK THEY SET THIS WHOLE THING UP? YUP. AND NOW I'M GONNA HAVE TO CHARGE BOTH OF THEM WITH ARSON AND PROBABLY FRAUD. AND I HATE TO DO THAT TO A FELLOW I'D KNOWN MY WHOLE LIFE. I SEE YOUR PROBLEM. SO, WILL YOU TALK TO THEM, MR. STRACHEY? LIKE GENTLEMEN. ARE YOU INSANE? THAT'S BAILEY'S OFFER, JOHN. I THINK YOU SHOULD TAKE IT. JUST PACK UP YOUR STUFF AND GO. BOB BAILEY IS A FASCIST. YOU KNOW, WHEN WE WERE KIDS, WE USED TO BE FRIENDS. USED TO BE. BUT NOW, THEY WANT ME OUT OF HERE. AND HE'S OUT TO GET ME JUST LIKE THE REST OF THOSE HOMOPHOBIC COPS. INCLUDING THE COPS THAT CAUGHT YOU STEALING DRUGS FROM THAT HOSPITAL? THAT WAS MORPHINE. FOR A FRIEND'S LOVER. HE WAS DYING. HE WAS IN PAIN, BEGGING TO END IT. YOU EVER BEEN AROUND HORROR LIKE THAT? YEAH, I HAVE. ANYWAY, I DIDN'T STEAL IT. I PAID FOR IT WITH MY JOB AND MY NURSE'S LICENSE. IT'S A FUCKING SHAME THE WAY PEOPLE WITH AIDS HAVE TO SUFFER BECAUSE OF THE HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY TRYING TO MAKE ANOTHER MILLION DOLLARS. SHOULDN'T YOU BE AT WORK, EDDIE? OR DID YOU TAKE THE DAY OFF LIKE YOU DID YESTERDAY? YEAH, BAILEY CALLED THE COPY SHOP. I WAS THERE. THEY'RE LYING. THEY'RE NOT GONNA TELL THE COPS THAT I WAS WORKING OVERTIME UNDER THE TABLE. IT'S AGAINST THE LAW. SO IS ARSON. WAIT A MINUTE. YOU'RE ON HIS SIDE, AREN'T YOU? YOU BELIEVE THAT ASSHOLE BAILEY INSTEAD OF ANOTHER GAY MAN. DO YOU REALLY HATE YOURSELF THAT MUCH FOR BEING QUEER? JOHN, SAVE THE SPEECH. I'VE HEARD IT. OH, THAT'S WHAT IT IS, ISN'T IT? YOU HATE YOURSELF. I KNOW ALL ABOUT YOU, DONALD STRACHEY. I KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU. I KNOW HOW YOU ENDED UP LIKE THIS. THAT'S ENOUGH. WHAT MUST THAT BE LIKE FOR YOU, HUH? WHAT MUST THAT BE LIKE TO LOOK AT YOURSELF IN THE MIRROR EVERY MORNING AND SEE A HOMOSEXUAL LOOKING BACK AT YOU? I BET YOU WANT TO KILL YOURSELF, DON'T YOU? I BET YOU JUST WANT TO DIE. JOHN. I QUIT! YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT. JUST WALK AWAY. LIKE YOU WALKED AWAY FROM YOUR LIFE. WELL, SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO TAKE A STAND, FIGHT BACK. I HOPE YOU'RE FEELING REAL GOOD ABOUT YOURSELF, STRACHEY. I HAD ANOTHER MESSAGE TODAY. THEY SAID LAST TIME THEY BURNT THE HOUSE. NEXT TIME IT'S GONNA BE ME. I'M GONNA BE THE NEXT QUEER-BASHING DEATH STATISTIC AND IT'LL BE ON YOUR HEAD. BACK OFF! I'LL SEND YOU BACK YOUR CHECK MINUS EXPENSES. THEY'RE GONNA KILL ME, STRACHEY. AND WHEN I'M DEAD, YOU'LL KNOW IT'S BECAUSE OF YOU. YOU SELF-LOATHING, PRE-STONEWALL PIECE OF SHIT FAGGOT! GAY, GAY, GAY. ALWAYS WITH THE GAY. WHAT THE HELL IS THAT? I LIKE IT. IT'S KIND OF CAMPY. I DIDN'T ORDER CAMPY. I ORDERED MINIMALIST. WELL, IT ADDS A CERTAIN CHARACTER TO THE ROOM. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? IT LOOKS LIKE LIBERACE THREW UP ALL OVER MY CEILING.

HOW COME HE GAVE YOU A LITTLE OVER $6000 LAST YEAR? CLEANING SERVICES? THERE ARE BACTERIUM EVERYWHERE IN A PLACE LIKE THIS. DISEASES. ONE MUST KEEP THINGS STERILIZED. THERE ARE ABOUT 90 REFERENCES TO YOU AND YOUR MOTEL IN JOHN RUTKA'S FINANCIAL RECORDS. I DON'T THINK YOUR CLIENTELE WOULD BE TOO HAPPY IF THEY START FINDING OUT THAT YOU ARE SELLING THEIR NAMES. SO, YOU'RE BLACKMAILING ME? IS THAT THE PURPOSE OF THIS VISIT? NO, IT ISN'T. I WANT TO KNOW ABOUT RONNIE LINKLATER. I'M SORRY, I DON'T WATCH TELEVISION. THAT'S BAD, HOWIE. JUST LEAVE ME ALONE.

RONNIE MUST HAVE CALLED SOMEONE ON HIS CELL PHONE. BECAUSE A WHITE CAR TURNED UP, TWO MEN GOT OUT IN LONG COATS, YOU KNOW LIKE BUSINESS MEN OR MAFIA. I WAS AFRAID THAT RONNIE'S FRIEND MIGHT HAVE BEEN A GODFATHER OR SOMETHING. SO I KEPT MY NOSE OUT OF IT. ONE OF THE MEN DROVE AWAY IN THE WHITE CAR AND THE OTHER ONE DROVE AWAY IN THE BOYFRIEND'S BLUE CAR. DID YOU TELL ANYBODY ABOUT THIS? RONNIE GAVE ME A THOUSAND SHUT UP DOLLARS. SO, I WENT IN.

WHY? RONNIE'S A CHURCH-GOING BOY? YOU REALLY DON'T KNOW VERY MUCH, NOW DO YOU? RUTKA HEARD RONNIE SINGING IN THE SAINT MICHAEL'S CHOIR. AND HE CONVINCES HIM TO GET INTO SHOW BUSINESS.

BISHOP MCFEE IS YOUR BROTHER? YEAH. AND HE BORROWS THE CAR. ISN'T THAT NICE. THEY LIED ABOUT THE MIRROR FALLING ON THE BISHOP AND ALMOST KILLING HIM, JUST TO COVER UP HIS AFFAIR WITH RONNIE LINKLATER. I WONDER WHAT ELSE THEY'RE HIDING.

WE WERE JUST DRIVING BY THE NEIGHBORHOOD. AND IT WAS A LOVELY DAY AND WE THOUGHT THAT WE WOULD. FATHER MORGAN I'M WORKING ON THE JOHN RUTKA CASE. ARE YOU FAMILIAR? THE HOMOSEXUAL ACTIVIST? THAT'S RIGHT. SAD SITUATION. SERIOUS. I JUST NEED TO KNOW WHO WAS THE PARISH PRIEST WAS AT SAINT MICHAEL'S WHEN JOHN RUTKA WAS A BOY, LATE 50'S EARLY 60'S? OH MY GOSH. THAT WAS BEFORE MY TIME HERE. YOU KNOW I COULD SIMPLY LOOK IT UP FOR YOU, IF YOU LIKE. GREAT. ALRIGHT, JUST GIVE ME A MOMENT. AND STAY HERE. OKAY. OKAY. SMOOTH. FATHER MORGAN, BOB. WHAT'S THIS ALL ABOUT? THIS CAR, WHO OWNS IT? THE DIOCESE. AND WHO NORMALLY DRIVES IT? THE BISHOP DOES. HE DID UNTIL HE HAD HIS ACCIDENT. AND THEN? I DRIVE IT NOW. FATHER MORGAN, I'M AFRAID I'M GONNA ASK YOU WHERE YOU WERE ON THE NIGHT OF JOHN RUTKA'S MURDER AND YOU MAY WANT YOUR ATTORNEY PRESENT. BOB, I CAN ASSURE YOU. FATHER, I DON'T THINK YOU UNDERSTAND ME. YOU'RE UNDER ARREST FOR THE MURDER OF JOHN RUTKA. THEY SAY HE CAME OUT OF IT LAST NIGHT. IT'S BEEN A MAD HOUSE EVER SINCE. BISHOP MCFEE, DO YOU REMEMBER ANYTHING ABOUT THE ACCIDENT? DID YOU KNOW THE DIOCESE IS UNDER INVESTIGATION? HOW DOES IT MAKE YOU FEEL, BISHOP? EVERYONE OUT IN HERE OR YOU'RE ALL GOING TO JAIL. COME ON. COME ON. IS THAT? I KNOW YOU. BISHOP MCFEE.

TIMOTHY CALLAHAN. PLEASURE TO MEET YOU. PLEASURE. YOUR PARTNER WAS A BIG HELP ON THIS CASE. I TAUGHT HIM EVERYTHING HE KNOWS. YEAH WE WOULDN'T HAVE NABBED THAT ONE FOR YEARS. FATHER MORGAN? BUT I THOUGHT HE WAS JUST TRYING TO PROTECT THE BISHOP? NO, I MEAN THE BISHOP. I'D HEARD THE RUMORS THROUGH THE YEARS THAT HE'S DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHER PRIESTS. PICKED ONE BOY WITH A STICK FOR THREE YEARS. THREATENING THEM, TERRIFYING THEM, KEEP THEM QUIET. I READ THE PAPERS THIS MORNING A FEW MORE MEN HAVE COME FORWARD WITH CHARGES OF THEIR OWN. WELL I WONDER, WHY JOHN DIDN'T JUST OUT MCFEE HIMSELF. WELL, WHAT HE COULDN'T DO IN LIFE IS CERTAINLY ACCOMPLISHED NOW. DONALD. I WANT YOU TO KNOW, JOHN WOULD REALLY BE PROUD OF WHAT YOU DID. EDDIE, I NEED TO TELL YOU, YOU KNOW, I WISH I COULD HAVE DONE MORE. I WANT TO PAY FOR YOUR WORK. I TALKED TO THE RUTKA FAMILY LAWYER. JUST SEND THEM THE BILL AND HE'LL WRITE YOU A CHECK. LET'S NOT TALK ABOUT THAT RIGHT NOW. NO, NO, NO WAIT. ACTUALLY EDDIE WHERE DO YOU EXACTLY, DO YOU WANT THE BILL SENT? DAVID RESUTO. HE'S HERE IN ALBANY OH YEAH, YEAH. ARE YOU TAKING A TRIP? YES, THERE'S NOTHING LEFT FOR ME HERE NOW WITHOUT JOHN. I'M GOING BACK TO MANHATTAN AND STAY WITH THESE GUYS FOR AWHILE AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS. YOU KNOW, TAKE IT ONE DAY AT A TIME. WELL SEE YOU LATER, EDDIE. YOU TOO, TIMMY. TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF. YOU TOO. DONALD STRACHEY. SO EDDIE GOES BACK TO THE BIG CITY TO START OVER, CASE CLOSED. IF THERE'S EVER A CASE I WANTED CLOSED, IT'S THIS ONE HUH? OH NO. WHAT? DAVID RESUTO. THE RUTKA FAMILY ATTORNEY. JOHN'S FINANCIAL RECORDS. FOURTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS TO A D.R. IT'S DAVID RESUTO. DONALD? DONALD. CASE CLOSED? SORRY. JESUS. YOUR BROTHER GAVE SOME MONEY TO A DAVID RESUTO, FOURTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS. YOU KNOW WHAT, MISTER STRACHEY? I DON'T THINK THIS IS VERY APPROPRIATE. ANNE, PLEASE. DID YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S FOR? YES. OF COURSE. LIFE INSURANCE. THE BENEFICIARY? EDDIE, OBVIOUSLY. HOW MUCH DID HE GET? YOU KNOW, IT THAT REALLY ANY OF YOUR BUSINESS? ANNE, JUST TELL ME, WAS IT ENOUGH FOR HIM TO GO OFF AND LIVE HAPPILY EVER AFTER? OKAY. WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO SAY? JUST SPIT IT OUT. EDDIE SANTON JUST BECAME A VERY RICH MAN. EXCUSE ME, EXCUSE ME. PARDON ME. TIMMY. I LOVE YOU. OKAY. I LOVE YOU TOO. GOOD, TAKE A CAB HOME. WHAT? DONALD? WHERE ARE YOU GOING? ALRIGHT I'LL JUST CATCH A TAXI CAB. I'LL HAVE DINNER READY. HAVE SOME MARTINIS CHILLING. I'LL JUST GET A TAXI. PRIVATE EYES. LAST CALL FOR FLIGHT 431 TO MEXICO CITY. LAST CALL FOR FLIGHT 431 TO MEXICO CITY. HOW ABOUT WE GET TO MEXICO, YOU BUY ME LUNCH. YOU'RE RICH. DONALD. HOW FABULOUS TO SEE YOU. I'M GLAD I HAVE THIS CHANCE TO THANK YOU FOR FINDING MY MURDERER. CANDY? FALSE TEETH. CONGRATULATIONS, JOHN. NICE WORK. IT TOOK A WHILE FOR MY FRIENDS AT THE HOSPITAL TO FIND THE RIGHT BODY. STUCK AN OLD SET OF MY DENTURES IN ITS MOUTH AND A BULLET WOUND IN THE LEG, AND IT ALL WORKED, BEAUTIFULLY. NO, IT DIDN'T WORK BEAUTIFULLY, JOHN. FATHER MURPHY'S BEING ARRAIGNED ON A MURDER CHARGE TODAY, AND HE'S INNOCENT. HARDLY. HE HELPED MCFEE COVER UP HIS SEX CRIMES. HE DID NOT COMMIT A MURDER. LOOK. OUTING IS OVER, DONALD. IT DOESN'T HAVE SHOCK VALUE ANYMORE. I KNEW I HAD TO DO SOMETHING MORE TO BRING DOWN MCFEE. AND NOW IT'S DONE. YOU KNEW ABOUT THIS? YOU PLANNED TO FUCK ME HARD? NO, HE HAD NO PART IN IT. HE HAD NO IDEA. I HATED TO DO IT. BUT EDDIE'S GRIEF WAS AN IMPORTANT PART OF MAKING IT LOOK REAL. I WAS PISSED OFF AT FIRST BUT, JOHN'S BACK. THAT'S ALL I CARE ABOUT. JOHN, YOU GET ON THAT AIRPLANE, THEY'RE GONNA EXTRADITE YOU, YOU'RE GONNA BE RIGHT BACK HERE IN JAIL. ON INSURANCE FRAUD. I GUESS THAT DEPENDS ON WHETHER OR NOT YOU TELL, DOESN'T IT DONALD? AFTER WHAT YOU'VE PUT ME THROUGH, I'D LIKE TO LOCK YOU UP MYSELF. BUT YOU WON'T. WATCH ME. NO, WATCH ME. WE'RE TAKING THE MONEY TO MEXICO WHERE THERE'S A PHARMACEUTICAL LAB. WE'RE GOING TO ESTABLISH A NETWORK TO GET DRUGS TO HIV PATIENTS WHO CAN'T AFFORD THEM, HERE AND OVERSEAS. JOHN. SHUT THE FUCK UP. HE'S RIGHT. INSURANCE COMPANIES CUT OFF AIDS PATIENTS AFTER A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MONEY IS SPENT. WHAT'S A FEW HUNDRED THOUSAND TO AN INSURANCE COMPANY? THIS IS BULLSHIT. THEY SPEND 10 TIMES THAT FOR LAWYERS AND LOBBYISTS WHO FIGURE OUT HOW TO PISS ON PEOPLE. THIS IS BULLSHIT. WHEN THOSE PEOPLE NEED THE INSURANCE THE MOST, THAT'S ABSOLUTE SO I'M ASKING YOU, DONALD. BULLSHIT. JOHN, YOU'RE A LIAR. YOU'VE BEEN A LIAR SINCE THE DAY YOU WERE BORN! NOT SINCE THE DAY I WAS BORN. I LEARNED TO LIE. YOU KNOW WHO TAUGHT ME? MCFEE WAS A DEMON. DON'T TELL ANYONE, JOHN. OR YOU'LL GO TO HELL. TO ETERNAL DAMNATION IF YOU TELL. THOSE WERE STRONG WORDS TO A CHILD. AND THEN HE'D DO WHAT HE DID. WEEK AFTER WEEK. JESUS, DONALD I WAS NINE YEARS OLD. NINE. OKAY. GO BACK AND TELL THEM I'M NOT REALLY DEAD IF YOU WANT TO. GET MORGAN OFF THE HOOK. JUST SAY YOU SAW ME IN EDDIE'S CAR AND YOU LOST US IN TRAFFIC. BUT JUST LET US DO WHAT WE HAVE TO DO. DONALD. YOU ONCE SAID THAT YOU NEW ABOUT ME. WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? I HAD A FILE ON YOU, TOO. I KNEW ALL ABOUT YOUR ARMY CAREER. YOU MADE SERGEANT, MILITARY INTELLIGENCE. YOU WERE ON A FAST TRACK. BUT YOU WERE CAUGHT IN BED WITH A LIEUTENANT. AND YOU RATTED HIM OUT, YOU SLINKED OUT OF THE ARMY, WITH A DISCHARGE THE SECOND THEY YELLED QUEER. NOT A FIGHT, NOT A PEEP. THIS IS YOUR CHANCE, STRACHEY. YOU CAN DO SOMETHING DECENT FOR A CHANGE. DECENT. SO, YOU LOST THEM IN TRAFFIC ON THE FREEWAY? THAT'S IT. JUST SAY IF ANYONE ASKS, I LOST THEM. THANK YOU. SO, SAINT TIMOTHY. WHERE'S THIS ONE FALL ON THE SCALE OF ABSOLUTE RIGHT AND WRONG? AM I A CRIMINAL? YOU KNOW I'M STARTING TO WONDER, IF MAYBE LIFE ISN'T ALWAYS BLACK AND WHITE. IN KANSAS MAYBE. BUT NOT HERE IN EMERALD CITY. WHAT ABOUT FATHER MORGAN? HE'LL BE OUT ON INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE AND A SOLID ALIBI. SO FAR AS THE POLICE ARE CONCERNED WHO KILLED JOHN RUTKA? NO ONE. THEY'LL POKE AROUND FOR A COUPLE OF MONTHS AND THE CASE WILL LAND IN THE UNSOLVED CRIMES FILE. IN A COUPLE OF YEARS WE'LL ALL FORGET IT EVER HAPPENED. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? THAT'S- A KICKSTART ON OUR NEW FIRE PLACE WITH THE WORK OF ABSOLUTE GOOD. SUCH THINGS DO EXIST, YOU KNOW. I DO.
