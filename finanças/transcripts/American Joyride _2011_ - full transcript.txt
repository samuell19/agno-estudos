Hey, baby, look over here. >> Hold on, honey. >> You don'’t know what you're missing. We'’re out here in the woods all by ourselves. >> Oh, honey, we'’re supposed to be doing a nature show. >> Who'’s to say I'm not natural? >> [ laughs ] Come here. Come here. Oh, yeah, that'’s nice. >> [ giggles ] Oh, look. How cute! >> Oh, darlin'’. >> She'’s selling lemonade. >> There. >> Thank you. >> There you go. >> Oh, babe, she'’s so cute. I want one. >> Soon, baby, soon. Yeah, I repossessed that last night. That'’s where I got this here camera. And this here'’s my beaut. She'’s got a couple of dings in it. Crys don'’t like it, but, damn, she goes fast, let me tell you. >> Ty! It says we'’re evicted. >> Wait a second. Hold on a second. That don'’t mean nothin'. >> Don'’t mean nothin'? How can we be evicted? Didn'’t we pay the rent? >> I ain'’t got the money yet, but I will just as soon as Tank picks up that truck tomorrow night. >> I thought he paid you last week. >> Look, you got to get to work, all right? Just let me handle it. >> All right. >> Shit. >> How come you got to cut early? >> Wasn'’t no one there. >> How much you make tonight? >> 22 bucks. >> That'’s not bad. >> Bud was riding me all night. Called me lazy, told me to clean the tables and I just did it. >> Asshole. >> That ain'’t the worst of it. I go in there to get my clothes out and he'’s standing there with his dick in his hand. >> What? >> Tell me I'’ll come around-- >> That motherfucker! I oughta to kick his fuckin'’ ass, Crys! >> No, baby. We need this at least till I can find another job. [ changing TV channels ] >> What you doing? >> Getting ideas. >> From reality TV? You hate this shit. It just makes you mad. >> Makes me mad '’cause it's so bad. Just boring, no creativity. You know I could do better than this, Crys. What'’s this? >> The baby money. >> The what? >> $842. 44 after tonight. I been saving up for when we have a baby for a year now writing my tips down. >> How come you didn'’t tell me about this? >> It was a surprise, but I figure the way things are right now, we need every little bit we can get. So I just wanted you to know it was there. >> Thank you, Crys. >> You'’re welcome, baby. [ engine starts ] >> Oh, shit! Goddamn it! >> What? What? >> Keys! Where the keys? Crys, where are the keys? >> What happened? >> Of course the goddamn thing don'’t work when you need it to. >> Should we call the police? >> Oh, no. They'’ll just fuck it up worse. >> Um...what about Tank? >> Fuck! Fuckin'’ fucked! >> The truck got stolen. It ain'’t your fault. >> He ain'’t gonna see it that way, Crys. He'’s gonna kill me. >> He'’s not gonna kill you, baby. >> You don'’t understand, Crys. I'’m leanin' with him. I owe him. >> Oh, God. >> I'’m so sorry, Crys. I been paying him for the last two months, half my paycheck. That'’s why I couldn't pay the rent. >> Goddamn it, Ty. >> Look, Crys, it was so close, all right? It was supposed to be a sure-- All you had to do was get the goddamned-- >> I don'’t wanna hear it! How much? >> Five grand. I'’m sorry, Crys. >> Unbelievable. And you wonder why I don'’t trust you. >> Hold on, hold on. >> Can you quit it with the camera? >> No. I wanna make a documentary. >> What? >> What if, instead of making a nature show, we made a movie about us? >> Get in the car. >> Listen. Just let me explain. I done seen all them reality shows on TV. Half of '’em ain't real. The other half just plain boring, right? >> Yeah? So? >> Yeah, well, those people, they ain'’t got real problems. They got them Hollywood producers paying '’em thousands of dollars just to put their lives up on the TV. Now you and me, now we got real problems. We got this here camera, we tape ourselves, put it together real nice. >> Who'’s gonna watch it? Nobody cares about us. >> Yeah, well, they should. Think about it, Crys. When they see the shit that you and I gotta deal with, they gonna love us. They gonna buy this here tape. They'’ll make us rich. All right, tell the camera what we'’re doing. >> We'’re goin' to see Dwight. >> Now you gotta be more specific. >> Huh? >> Like tell more details, you know, make it interesting. Tell about Dwight. >> Okay. He'’s my brother. He lives in Mississippi. He just got out of Parchman. That'’s the prison over there. Not for anything bad, just, you know, drugs and stuff like that. He'’s the only family I got, well, really, anyway. I raised him up from the time I was 15. >> Tell '’em why we're going to him. >> He said he'’s got some work that we can do to get the money to pay back Tank for the truck that we just got stolen and Ty'’s gambling debt. Pull over up at Sue'’s. >> Huh? >> Just pull over. Trust me. >> All right. >> All right, keep that thing running. I wanna remember this moment forever. >> That woman'’s got a mind of her own. That'’s why I love her. What'’d she do? >> Okay, go! >> What'’d you do? >> Just remembered I had the key. Lookit. >> [ laughs ] You tramp! You tramp! >> God, that felt good!

Yes indeed. >> Where'’s your lady? >> She is at church. She'’s at church. Yeah, services. She goes just about every week, you know. When we first got together, I met her actually right outside of a Gravitron. And I told her that I thought she looked really, really fine. I mean, better than any fair worker I'’ve ever come across, not a food worker, not a funnelier. I mean, she was funnelier hot, funnelier hot, but she was right there working the Gravitron. So, you know, I just thought that that meant something '’cause it's my favorite ride. Always has been, you know. >> Y'’all have church on Tuesday? >> She is really involved in the church and she never said that she was when we first got together and she never, ever, ever, ever, ever went to church. And then we got this new pastor in town and, you know, he'’s a really handsome devil and she'’s just been a right-hand man of the pastor like she says right hand of the Lord is the good hand you wanna be at and she'’s trying to give him her right hand all the time. She spends long hours helping people now and she never really helped me do anything, you know, not even pick up after her or get her out of jail or-- >> She went to jail, too? >> She did, but nothing bad. Same thing, just drinking and driving and hit a lady, you know, she hit-- Yeah, the lady'’s all right. She walks a little differently than she did beforehand. We both saw her and I said, hey, look at that lady. There'’s old...you know, she looked like Miss Jenkins. I thought she was Miss Jenkins and it turned out she sure enough was. She wears one of them boots like one shoe'’s got a heel on it and the other one'’s got a larger heel on it now. Miss Jenkins is out of the hospital, my lady, we got her out of jail a couple weeks later. I saved up about $500, saved up in the sense that I went in to someone'’s house while they weren'’t home and took the $500 out of that house. And I went on down to the jail and got her out.

They do look nice, but they don'’t run worth a shit. >> Nothing but trouble, exactly. >> That'’s right. >> Nothing but trouble since we got it. >> Next time around then, you gotta find yourself a new type of trouble. Sure enough, right? You just keep on getting the same type of trouble, you'’re bringing the same type of trouble, you just gonna be... >> Goddamn it, Billy! Did you steal another fuckin'’ Jaguar?

Are you sure? >> Well, we would love to stay. We just can'’t. >> I have a costume you could wear too if you want. >> No, that'’s okay. >> You sure? >> Yeah. >> I got some things left over from where I used to work at the Gravitron. >> Oh, really? >> Hey. >> Hey. >> Hey, babe. >> Hey, you all right? >> Yeah.

Hey, what you got here? I thought you two was broke? >> Well, we did pretty well for ourselves on the way up. >> What do you mean by that? >> Yeah, well, we managed to find ourselves a little bit of cash along the way. Hey, let me see that. >> A little cash, and what about this car? >> Well, we had to get rid of ours yesterday '’cause we got caught on tape when we got ourselves a freebie at a gas station the other day. >> What? >> But it was the craziest thing. Last night, we'’re at dinner and this drunk rich guy just drops his valet ticket on the ground. Ty picks it up and, voila, we got ourselves a Jaguar. >> I'’m having a little hard time following all that. So you robbed a gas station first and then you stole a car and then you drove it up my driveway? Is that what you did? Are you fucking retarded? >> Hold on a second, all right, Dwight? Now the gas station was a fuck-up. Now we done this car right. We changed the plates out and everything. >> Oh, you changed the plates and everything? Whooptee fuckin'’ do. >> That was in Florida. We ain'’t in Florida no more. >> I know this ain'’t Florida! This your idea? '’Cause I sure as shit know it wasn'’t her idea! >> You can put your bullshit-- >> Look, you said you'’d take care of my sister! >> I am taking care of your sister. Ain'’t no use for saying that! >> At this rate, we'’re all gonna wind up in the Goddamn penitentiary and I already been there. Can you put that Goddamn thing down? >> I can'’t. We're making a documentary. >> What? >> You know, a movie about our lives. >> I know what a documentary is, sis. I'’m trying to say is you did all this and put it on tape? Well, film this. >> Dwight, stop it! Well, that didn'’t work out so well, did it? >> He ain'’t got the right to come at me like that. You know, I'’m doing the best I can with what I got. >> Hey, I'’m sorry. We just fightin'’ is all. >> Y'’all gonna play nice? >> Yeah. >> Damn it, I'’m trying, you know. And I love Crys and that should count for something. >> It'’s just a movie, Dwight. >> You be calling it a documentary. Everybody knows that makes it real. >> Uh-uh. Half those reality shows on TV are fake. Most of '’em are just made up. People aren'’t gonna know this is real. >> That is the stupidest thing I ever heard. >> And he'’s her brother, so I'’m gonna give him another chance. >> Well, keep the camera, but you will get rid of that car. >> We just got it. >> Crys, it'’s like a flashing neon sign saying, hey, I'’m breaking the law. It'’s stupid. It'’s like robbing a liquor store. >> We didn'’t rob no liquor store. >> Yeah, I know, and you ain'’t gonna. What I'’m trying to say is, it'’s not worth it. It'’s a bad risk-reward ratio. This is what you'’re gonna do. Are you listening? >> Yeah. >> You'’re gonna take your car, drive it out about 20 miles from here. You'’re gonna follow him and you'’re gonna drop that car off. >> Where? >> I don'’t know. Hell, I don'’t wanna know. Your little friend here, you'’re gonna be staying with me. Howdy, there. My name'’s Dwight. As you can see, I'’m pretty much bad-ass and this is my humble abode. Yep, good thing about trailers, you can up and leave whenever you want. You never know when you'’re gonna need to get. This redneck likes to read. Go figure on that one. Yeah, and as you can see here, it'’s never a bad idea to be too prepared for anything. [ knock on door ] You'’re gonna have to excuse me. That'’s a sweet little piece of ass I got at my front door. You know what? I think I'’m gonna have to put you down so she don'’t know about it.

[ rifle cocks ] >> Hey. >> You gonna tell me who the fuck'’s looking for you, huh? >> Hey! >> Dammit! >> Hey, stop! >> Who the fuck you owe 10 grand to, huh? >> Stop, stop! >> Five grand! >> Yeah, well, it'’s 10 now, baby. Let me guess--you lost-- [ all shouting ] >> That'’s why we came out here, to get the money to pay him back. >> Who? Who? >> A guy named Fish Tank Collins! You know Fish Tank? >> You listen up. I saved your ass tonight. Told them you were on your way up to Memphis. You sleep in the barn tonight. >> I don'’t wanna talk to him no more. You know what? You wanna talk to him. I don'’t wanna talk to him. You coming? [ gunshot ] [ gunshot ] >> It'’s all right. >> What in the hell are y'’all doing? You scared the shit out of me. >> Hey, Crys. Sleep all right? >> Morning. >> Hey, give it a shot. >> Whoo! [ laughs ] >> It'’s clean? >> Looks pretty good. >> All right. Crys, I'’m gonna be taking Vegas with me on a little business trip. >> Hey, name'’s Ty. >> Vegas here and I are gonna be going on a business trip, all right? >> I can'’t come? >> I guess, but you'’re gonna have to stay in the car. >> ♪ The sounds he can see ♪ From his back ♪ And his feet off the ground ♪ Like a ghost in his eyes ♪ Now will he? ♪ Run alive through the night ♪ He don'’t feel anymore ♪ ♪ As the sirens blaze ♪ And all the children dance ♪ He'’s got what it takes ♪ ♪ To make it ♪ But do you feel content? ♪ '’Cause God loves ♪ ♪ All the children ♪ But only children who repent ♪ He'’s got what it takes... ♪ >> Reach in there and pull those out, okay? >> That'’s a nice-looking Glock. >> Goddamn right.

We'’re gonna make that into half a mil. >> We are? >> MM-hmm. Me and Dwight, we decided to be business partners. >> When did you decide this? >> Earlier this evening. >> You think maybe it'’d be a good idea to talk to me about it first? >> Jeez, woman. You know, I gotta make my own decisions sometimes. You know what? One of these times is this time. >> No. No. >> Yes. >> This is not a good thing to be decided on by yourself. >> I'’m deciding it, woman. I'’m deciding it. >> Are you the decider? >> Listen, I thought you'’d be proud of me. You know, just trying to take care of you and all. >> Drug dealing? This is supposed to be temporary. >> Crys, what'’d you think I was going in there to do? Make friends, huh? >> Shit, I don'’t know. >> Sell Girl Scout cookies? >> Sit down. Sit down. >> Going around door to door? >> Stop. Be serious. You have to be serious. This is serious. >> Okay. Focused. Focused. Listen, we cut and run now, we get 10 grand, Crys. >> Ain'’t that what we need to pay back Tank? >> Mm-hmm, that is what we need to pay back Tank, but then we got nothing, all right? You gotta go back to Sue'’s and we gotta go back to that trailer and we ain'’t goin' back to that trailer. >> I can'’t go back to Sue's. I took their money. >> That'’s a very good point. [ both laugh ] >> It'’s not funny. It'’s not funny. >> No, it'’s not funny at all. [ chuckles ] Crys, we done got away this long. Another couple days won'’t hurt. >> All right. See you later. >> This isn'’t where I live. >> Something you wanna fill us in in that little luxury item you had right there? >> Man, I have honestly no idea. I woke up this morning and she was just there staring right at me. >> Staring at you? She does do a lot of staring. >> I think her name is Julep or something like that. >> Like a mint julep. >> I think that might have been what you were drinking. >> I'’m fine now.

Don'’t ever lie to me if you wanna live. >> What the fuck? >> What the fuck yourself? You ever heard of knocking? >> What the hell'’s going on in here, Dwight? >> You been in a bad mood since this morning. What is wrong? >> You fuckin'’ crazy bastard! Dumb ass, you could have shot me. >> I ain'’t shooting nobody. I just don'’t like people fuckin'’ with me. >> Who is fuckin'’ with you? '’Cause it ain't us. >> Whoa, whoa, whoa!

Just sit down. >> We'’re all family. >> Yeah. >> Well, I'’ve only known you two weeks, Vegas. >> Dwight. >> You know, a real gentleman would be helping me carry my bag rather than filming me carrying it. >> [ laughs ] That'’s the problem. I don'’t see no real gentleman around here, Crys. You keep looking like that, we ain'’t never gonna leave. >> What the fuck? >> What? Oh, shit. Goddamn-- >> You get that thing outta my fuckin'’ face! Goddamn it! >> What'’s all the guns for? >> Look, shit got a little more complicated than I anticipated. >> What do you mean by that? >> It was supposed to be a straight deal, cash for product. I ain'’t the only runner these guys got. You know that. The last one got fucked over pretty hard by these Mexicans. They cut the product with something. >> What does that mean for us? >> Well, it ain'’t good, Crystal. The Jefferson brothers, they want revenge. That arsenal you seen in the back of my truck? Had me pick it up last night and tonight I'’m delivering it to somebody else, and that was fine. Now they wanna know the location of our exchange. Do you know what that means? Do you? They'’re gonna ambush these fuckers while we'’re there! >> Oh, God. >> This might be a good time for y'’all to jump ship. No hard feelings. Can I get another round, please? >> We should hold off till after the meeting. >> Liquid courage, sis. >> If you need liquid courage, maybe we shouldn'’t be doing it. >> It has to be done. You don'’t understand. >> Nothing has to be done, Dwight. Nothing ever has to be done. >> They think I'’m doing 'em a favor. Well, I don'’t do favors. I got a plan. >> A man with a plan. >> Can I get that shot, please? Where you going, sis? >> Dwight, what'’s goin' on, man? Dwight? Dwight, what'’s goin' on? >> Push come to shove, I need to know you got my back. Are you with me? >> Dwight, I'’m with you. I got your back. Now what'’s going on? >> You just wait. I got me a hunch. Well, well, sis. Going somewhere? You know, you take that money and run, it'’s gonna make things real hard for me. >> At least you won'’t be doing something stupid like getting shot just over some money! >> Yeah, that'’s when you know somebody'’s family. You know exactly what they'’re gonna do. >> I can'’t let you do this. I'’m not gonna let you do this. I'’m not. >> Sis, we'’re in this deep, real deep. I'’m talking you fuck this up, I'’m for sure dead. >> You have a choice, Dwight. You don'’t have to do this! >> This is my choice! It'’s the way I choose to live. I'’d be bored to shit otherwise. Y'’all coming? >> That fit? >> Yep. Good. >> All right. >> Where'’s yours? >> I don'’t wear condoms. >> That'’s just stupid. >> It'’s also the only one I got. Look, sis, you'’re gonna hear gunshots. Whatever you do, don'’t leave the car. Just promise me that, all right? >> Okay. >> Just get under the blanket and lay low. >> What if you don'’t come back? >> Well, wait an hour and then get the hell out of here. Give me that bag. All right, we'’re gonna go in and as soon as bullets start flying, we hit the deck and come out the same way we went in. They'’ll be facing the opposite direction. Won'’t know what hit 'em. >> All right. >> Please be careful. >> Sis, don'’t worry. Whatever happens, happens. And, Ty, that shit I said earlier, you know I didn'’t mean it. You'’re all right. All right, you ready? >> Yep. >> Let'’s do this. >> Good luck. >> I'’m doing this for us. >> I know, baby. >> See you in a second. >> Please, God, let them be okay. Please, God. I'’m so scared. [ crying ] I'’m so scared. [ gunshots ] [ gunshots ] [ running footsteps ] [ engine starts ] [ tires screech ] Please, God. >> Where are the keys? >> What happened? >> Where are the keys? >> What happened? What happened? >> Goddamn it! >> What happened? What happened? Where'’s Dwight? Where's Dwight? Where'’s Dwight, baby? Where'’s Dwight? Where is he? Why are we leaving him? Baby, where is he? Where is he? Baby, where is he? Where is he? Answer me! What happened? Let'’s go get him. [ crying ] Oh, God! Oh, God! Let'’s go get him. Let'’s go get him. Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God! >> We moved around last week going from motel to motel, laying low. Crys was a wreck. She'’s in the bath. Only place she can keep from crying. Everybody got killed back in Texas except for me and two of them shooters. Would have killed me too if they had known I wasn'’t dead. Now we got the money and the drugs. Just trying to find ourselves a buyer. >> Baby? >> Yeah? >> I don'’t feel good. >> I know, baby. >> No. I mean, I just threw up. >> I don'’t know what to do. It'’s been four days. Crys is still sick, some kind of stomach bug. I think we found a buyer for the drugs. Supposed to be meeting in an hour. I don'’t know. Hey, how you feeling? >> Shitty. >> Yeah? >> Why are you doing this? >> Honey, I do this, we'’re gonna have enough money to never even think about it. >> I'’m not worried about money. I'’m worried about you. >> Look, I know you miss him. I do. I miss him, too. But he wouldn'’t want you to spend the rest of your life like this, okay? What did he always say? >> Whatever happens, happens. >> Let'’s see if we can find some happiness today. Ty? >> I mean, Crys is right. We leave now, we can get the B&B free and clear. But if I do this deal, I mean, we'’ll be rolling in it. >> Oh, my God! Ty! Ty, baby! >> Hi, there. Remember me? >> Tank. >> That'’s Fish Tank to you, sugar. Here I thought you remembered me. You looking for something? You looking for this? Where'’s your piece of shit boy? >> Shit. I'’m all she's got. God, but it'’s so much money, you know? It'’s like fuck you money. She don'’t even want it. She don'’t even care. >> No! >> Just remembered, huh? I ain'’t here for the money. That'’s shit to me. I'’m here for you. I'’m here to fuck you upside down. >> No. No! >> She'’s worth it. She'’s worth every goddamn penny. >> Yeah, you keep fighting. It turns me on. Oh, it'’s gonna be like fuckin' a buckin'’ bronco. >> But I'’m pregnant! I'’m pregnant! >> Motherfucker! >> Why you look so surprised to see me? >> Tank, I didn'’t mean no disrespect. >> Oh, no? I'’m gonna show you what disrespect really is. Sit. You sit. Sit, doggie! >> All right, all right, okay. >> Well, well, well. [ laughs ] You two into some kinky shit? Oh, I know. Well, you'’re gonna make a different kind of video today. This thing on? I think your bitch got something to tell you. Ain'’t that right, huh? Go on. You tell him what you told me. >> I'’m pregnant. >> Huh? What? What'’d you say? >> I'’m pregnant. >> Oh, did you hear that? She'’s pregnant. But don'’t worry, buddy. She gonna have an abortion. >> Tank, wait a second, all right? I'’ll get you-- >> Fish Tank! You'’re gonna film it. [ laughs ] And I'’m gonna be her doctor. I'’m real good at this shit. >> We got it all. You can have all the money we got. >> Take the goddamn camera. Take it. Turn it here. Turn it right here. Everything you do gonna come back at you twice as hard, maybe even more. Ain'’t you figured that out yet? >> Tank! No! Tank, you got to stop! >> You wanna die right now? Put that thing in my face or in her stomach. You get it? That'’s how you're gonna pay me. You got it? I'’ll tell you when I'm done. >> She had enough, Tank! She had enough! She had enough, Tank! >> [ coughing and gasping ] >> That'’s probably about good. Now that I got rid of your baby, it'’s my turn to give her one of mine. >> No! >> Aw, what'’s the matter? You afraid she'’ll like my dick more than she likes yours? Oh, you'’re a hero now, huh? You'’re pissing me the fuck off. I was gonna let you live, you stupid fuck. Oh, you'’re a dead hero now.
