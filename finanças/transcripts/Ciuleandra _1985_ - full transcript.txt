ROMANIAFILM PRESENTS CIULEANDRA BASED ON LIVIU REBREANU'S NOVEL Father? What is it? What happened? I don't know. It seems that.. Speak clearly. What happened? I don't know. Madelaine died. What? I killed her, father. Why? I don't know. I don't know, I didn't want to. What do you want to do? What would you like the Minister of Justice to do before resigning and vanishing from the political life of this country? Father, just a moment... Hello, give me the Prefect, miss. Yes, thank you. Hi, this is Policarp Faranga. No, we didn't leave and we won't leave either. My son killed his wife. Yes, as you heard. My son.. Yes, I need you. Of course, the prosecutor on duty and who else you consider. How else? Yes, yes, what else can we do? We are waiting for you. He's going to arrest me, isn't he? There would we another solution. I knew you would find it. Which one? This one! I was wrong, father. You was wrong? You're joking. You're an assasin, my boy. A Faranga, an ordinary killer, like any scoundrel. In half an hour the Prefect will be here. Until then, you have to choose. You ruined everything I hoped to do. But you are lucky, I will not accept the name Faranga that meant something in the history of this country to be tarnished in the mud of the press, in the cesspool of the freedom of expression. But at least, did you have a reason? The shadow of a reason? No. It's all right. In this way, with "No" and "I don't know" it seems plausible. Father, do you want me to pretend that I am crazy? The Prefect of the capital. What a disgrace! I can't believe it's true! Gentlemen, let me accompany you. He must be present? No, no. Let's not aggravate the state of depression that in fact, caused misunderstandings. Here you go. The prosecutor is a good guy, he is deeply grateful since you approved his transfer to Bucharest. Yes, Zamfir, I remembered his name. Let's see my child, I don't want to hurt you. Are you a child? Gentlemen, regarding this homicide, of course an involuntary one. A miserable event, a mere coincidence. There is only one solution: a sanatorium. A medical expertise. No, I'm ready to bear all the consequences. You shut up now! Great idea, Puiu! I have concluded the minutes, if the Minister wishes.. Don't bother me with this office paperwork. We'll have time for this. Sir, are we taking the corps to the morgue? No way. We will take care of Madelaine. Why are you staring? What do you think about Chirileanu's sanatorium? As far as I know, he spends his vacation on Cote d'azur. He must have left an assistant. I'll call him right now. Yes. Come on, Puiu. Open the gate, what are you looking at? Can't you see I am with the Prefect's car? Come on, don't talk to this idiot anymore. I'll go first. I talked with Minister Faranga on the phone. Do you want to tell me what he did? He killed his wife! A moment of straying, of recklessness. Please have a copy of the report signed by the coroner and a decision for admission from the Police signed by you. What's your name, sir? Doctor Dumitru Aioanei, professor Chirileanu's assistant. All right, doctor, let's check in the patient first and then we'll solve all the formalities, yes? Please follow me, mr Faranga. I think you had a good idea to bring him here. Yes, I hope. I will ask you to hand us the belt, the tie, the laces and the sharp objects. This is how it's done in prison! Here is the pavilion for the patients who commited murder. Here you go. Here you go. Here is the room. It has also been used once for such a situation. It's not great, anyway, but that's it. Sorry, gentlemen, but that's all we can offer. Doctor, I want you to understand: I am the Prefect of the police and he is Mr Policarp Faranga, Ministry of Justice. So I pretend you to take a special care of your patient. Mr Prefect, we do our duty properly. You do your duty to the ordinary ones, the one which come from the street corners As for Mr Faranga's son, you must try to make him feel at home here. "Mon cher" Poli, you have to forgive me now, I must leave. We are all leaving. Puiu doesn't need anyone for the moment. Tomorrow morning I'll stop by. Have courage, my boy. Be brave, Puiu, be a man. Don't worry. Don't kill her! No! No! Wait! Wait! Open the door! Open the door! Open up, don't you hear? Open up! Open up! Please take off your clothes. All right, Doctor, but I killed my wife. I was told about it. Please take off your clothes. I don't know why I did it. No matter how hard I try to find an explanation! Lie on the bed, please. At first I thought I didn't love her, then I realised I loved her. I loved her like no other woman. You are kind enough to tell me what deseases you suffered from as a child? Does it make sense? I'm not crazy. It's just my father's stratagem. The name-Faranga! I'm perfectly normal and I'm ashamed of all this farce. Do you remember what deseases you had in childhood? Measles, scarlet fever, I don't know.. write what you want I only write the things you tell me. Lie down, please. Then write: She was beautiful she use to walk as a queen... All the men loved her and in the same time... So measles, scarlet fever? What age? Her skin smelled of field, sun honey. She never used perfumes. Why is the door closed? How can you do this? Leave me! What is the meaning of all these, doctor? I remind you that you are under observation in a sanatorium for mentally insane people and in a pre-trial detention. In the address I received from the Prosecutor's Office, I was informed that you are accused of murder But there would be indications that you comitted the deed during a nervous breakdown I must examine you to see if your guilt is total, partial or null. I didn't know that, I was told I was under arrest, though. So the guard in the other room? He is a police officer and I warn you that you can leave the room only accompanied by him. Doctor, how long will it take? One week, one month, two, maximum six. Anyhow, we have no interest in dragging things. Get dressed and follow me. Please, come in. My God, how many misfortunes happen in this world! Did you go to war? Yes, of course. My father arranged for me to be a liaison officer to the Ministry of defence So far, I know only that you killed your wife. I want you to tell me how and especially why you did it. Doctor.. Your question is mine, too even from the very moment after the disgrace. And yet, I'm not able to find the answer. We'll find it together. First, let's try to recreate the yesterday evening's events. Everything happened very quickly. Did you have any misunderstandings? Or any arguments? No, doctor. No. I will tel you all about it. Really all about it. It would be a relief for me. We were about to leave to a reception at the Palace. We were dressed. Madelaine was silent as ever. I asked her something, I don't know what. She didn't answer. She had no malice, nothing provocative. Nothing. She only wasn't present. I became angry. My ears started to tingle and I thought that she was insulting me I don't know why I felt that. At the same time I realized that she was still silent that she didn't say a word, that she only looked at me. No, she didn't look at me, her gaze passed through me and I couldn't stand that anymore. She was a very beautiful woman. It's not me who says so, it's everybody. Were you jealous? No, never. Me, jealous? I cheated her shamelessly with women... with women who wouldn't have deserved to kiss her feet! I don't want to tire you today. We'll talk about everything, little by little. We have enough time. Accompany him in his room. Goodbye. Doctor, did we know each other? No, mr Faranga, certainly not. Goodbye. I brought you everything. The servant took them in your room. I'll be right back, I just want to see the doctor. But I heard you had some trouble this morning. No, who told you? Nothing happened. All right. Go, I'll come, too. Why do you lock the door? Don't be angry, we have an order. Don't lock the door anymore! I need air, I am suffocating in this slum! Qu'est ce qu'il y a, (What happened), Puiu? Relax, son. You know, it's not that bad here. The professor is missing for about three months, but that doesn't mater, of course. His sitter must serve me with the same promptness. Chiriloiu's assistant is an appreciated doctor at the faculty and the presumed heir at his department. He is a distant guy, but he still had time to become a gentleman. Anyhow, as much as a peasant can become a gentleman I feel that we could get along. He thinks it might be a big nervous breakdown, especially after this morning's crisis. What do you personally think? What do I think? You must know, dad, that I didn't pretend it at all. I don't even see how I could pretend. What will happen at the end, if I will be declared sane? Don't exaggerate, we live among people. It's quite a punishment for me and for you that we have to bear the moral consequensces of this misfortune. But, if necessary, I will not allow things to happen as they should not. For now, though, I can't deal exclusively with you. Don't forget, we still have obligations toward poor Madeleine Yes, father, it's true. God, how vile and selfish I am! I hope you have got all you need. If you need anything else, let me know. Anyhow I will visit you everyday. Father... I'm so sorry I can't attend the funeral, too. Do take care how you behave, I'll take care of the rest. I brought you some jam and cold water. I don't want it, you take it. Thank you, father, wherevere we'll go, we'll arrive without your help. Let's dance, brothers. Let's dance! Fire! Do you need anything? If you want, leave the door open. Yes, fine, thank you. I brought the newspapers. Why?Who told you to bring me newspapers? The grand boyar ordered me to bring them to you every morning and evening. so that you will not get bored. The doctor just told me to ask you what you usually have for dinner and to bring you what you prefere. Why don't you leave me alone? Sir, we have to carry out orders. But please forgive me. So, you see, I'm a little nervous. Please. If you want.. bring me some tea. but make it very hot. That's good, sir. When someone is bittered, he must eat, otherwise the bitterness gets him down. CRIME OF PASSION? SPOUSAL CRIME THE SON OF A MINISTER, ASSASIN? What's your name, man? Grigore Leahu, sir. And where are you from? From Arges county, Cioflingeni. From Arges county? I used to go a lot in Arges county. An uncle from my mother's side has an estate at Manesti. It's possible.There are many estates there. When did they send you here? Last evening. I went to the mansion as well. It means you know why I am here.. Well, how couldn't I know, boyar? The trouble founds you everywhere, God forbid! And why do you think they brought me here, among the sick people, instead of.. They couldn't take you to jail, among all the ordinary thiefs and thugs. It would have been a shame. But the good Lord will take care and he will help you get out of here soon. In such trials, the jury always forgive the boyars. And how did you manage to come here, from the Arges County right in Bucharest? Furthermore, in police. Don't you have a house, a land, like all people? If even privileged people like you, have troubles... we are more unfortunate.. Who assumed you in the police? The troubles, who do you think? I was settled, married, had my own house and some land, as all the good people But when the war of 1916 came... I was on duty They made me a sergeant because I behaved well. When I returned home in 1918 I found my wife with a big belly. And she was the angry one, all the same. When I saw that she mocked me, I left them all. And you didn't tell anything to your wife when you found her so? I told her and I even beat her to remember me until her death. But in the end I left, not to be tempted by the devil to kill her. To get in jail for a wretch like her. I brought you some tea. Please. What's that? A sedative, for you to sleep well. I didn't want to kill her! I didn't want to kill her! I didn't want! Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Good morning. I brought you the newspapers. THE MINISTRY OF JUSTICE COMPROMISED SCANDAL IN HIGH SOCIETY I want to talk to the doctor. Did something happen? I need you, doctor. Take a seat. In the name of kindness, I ask you a favor. I am listening to you. I wish if it's possible... I could attend to the funeral, even from distance. All right, I'll take you. Thank you, doctor. Thank you. Why did you agree? Because you asked me in the name of kindness, no? We take her to the eternal place, and her name is part of the history of this family. A young flower who bent its corolla under the wind of misfortune. Facing fragility of life, we can only turn our spirit to divine forgivness and love. When the holy church wants to cover up something, it really does. If the deceased is not guilty I'll will be writing at the lost dog section. As it is mentioned in the Bible.. We take over the world, but then in grave we are together: the emperors and the poor ones. Have mercy.. Have mercy, people.. A penny, boyar.. Please. Doctor, I'd like to go home if it's possible. Grigore, take mr Faranga to the sanatorium. All right. Put your hat on so you don't get cold. Aren't you coming, doctor? No. Why did you bring him to the funeral? To see his reactions. So? So? Along with other data, this moment will help me draw my medical conclusions. Doctor, I wouldn't want you to think that I intend to save my son at any cost. I loved a lot Madelaine, in a way she was my creation But Puiu is my son. Blood from my blood. And Madelene is no more. Don't forget that. What do you want to drink? Forgive me, I am not permitted to drink during my job. Take the glass. Ah, for the dead's soul. Do the same. It makes easier. God forgive her! God forgive her! You must have loved her a lot. Why do you think that? Well, if you killed her...I think it was only for love. In the countryside, we only beat them, that's all we afford. We are peasants, what do we know? Cheers! In the beginning it wasn't love. It started like a game If I think about it seriously, it was not even desire. Only later, when I started to love her I understood that she didn't belong to me. She had something that she wanted only for herself. She didn't want to share herself. Only now I understand. The man, when is young is tormented Luckily, it pass quicky Your lover is waiting for you? Yes. If you will laugh again the way you did when you started dancing, I'll let you go. I wouldn't be able to do it this way, boyar. What did you say your name was? Madalina. Laugh, please laugh. Only the fools can laugh if they are ordered to. I'm not giving yo an order, I ask you, please. You know the dances? Yes, I knew them. There is one of them.. It's something like this: Something like this: Something like this: I don't know.Maybe it's a city dance. It's a weird dance. It's like a dance of life and death. It flows unstoppable, like a stream through the rocks. Do you understand? No, I don't know. Wait! Confess! Don't you hear me? Why did you kill her? How did you enter here, Comissioner? Please forgive me doctor, he is the police comissioner and he is my boss Please leave the patient's room. Oh, then you are considering him ill already? Please. All right, all right.. The victim and the case, both buried. A funeral without any autopsy, with an unknown approval. You are cancelling your tracks, as the bandits do. Well, sir, how do you want the poor ones to follow the law if you break it like a rag.. Mind your own bussiness, sir, you're not at the police station here. You said, you declared that I was sick. Just to make the police comissioner leave. Thank God! Doctor, is it true that you convinced yourself that I am not crazy? I am a murderer. All right, so what's the reason for murder? I was jealous. Now I know. I was jealous. This is something new. In one of our discussions you stated the contrary. You don't understand exactly the meaning of the word. I wasn't jealous of something, I was jealous of something. If it's not a secret, can you tell me what is that? Find it by yourself, doctor. You promised me that we would find it together. Yes.. Did you have extramarital affairs? But I've told you again! Countless! And yet, you said that you loved your wife. Above everything. Sit down. Then why did you cheat on her? Doctor, return to your books I talk about things which can't be seen under a microscope, like bacteria Since yesterday morning, the electrical instalation has failed. I'll send someone to fix it. My dear Edith, you are our family's best friend maybe your encouragements would work. And your frienship with Madeleine brings you even closer to Puiu's pain I understood why you asked me to come. It's very hard to understand everything. But for you and for Puiu I would be ready to do anything. Poor Madeleine.. Oh, but no!It's a foolishness. You'll say that you are really Napoleon. Yesterday, George, poor one, bumped with his Ford into a tree. He was lucky. Luckily he was drunk and he didn't realize it. Last week Ghighi Duca died in a sanatorium in Sweden. Cocaine and alchool are fatal. This is nice. Isn't it true that my father sent you? You know that I am sincere It was your father's idea. Doctor, untie me at once! I'm very sorry about that happened. In fact I don't understand why you did it. Doctor, please don't ask me why and how I got hurt. Do you feel better now? Is it day or night? The spring has come. Can we talk? Mr Faranga, I don't want to snatch unpleasants confessions from you. If any of my questions is too indiscreet, feel free and don't answer. You're wrong, doctor. I have nothing to hide. If you want, I tell you everything. Aren't you tired? No. I would like, if it's possible, to walk in the park. All started because of one of my father's whim, one of his obsessions. Changing the diluted anaemic blood of Faranga's family with young, fresh, healthy, peasant blood. And me, the only Faranga, I was going to sacrifice myself for my generation and marry a girl from the countryside, a girl chosen by my father, of course. Finally, on a Sunday, we went to Arges county, to Manesti to one of our properties to spend a few days there Due to the horrible roads, we only reach a village one hour from Manesti We were very hungry. Please, sir, come in! Go away! The woman was just preparing lunch, the wine is ready, please come in. Make way, make way.. Take a seat and please forgive us, boyar. How did you manage to keep them like a hundred years ago? Boys and girls. They are dancing "hora" at the crossroad. It's gorgeous. If you please, you can take a look, sir. You know, doctor, I was raised so that my contacts with the peasants were...how should I put it.. very rare. I was a sickly child and the peasants were..you know..dirty. Yes, but with a lot of healty blood, as we saw in 1907. Yes, when they rose up. It was a dance, a folk dance like I had never seen before. Strenght and tenderness at the same time. Unexpected changes of pace. Purely amazing. And the melody caught you in its waves like a stormy and clear water. What's the name of this dance? Ciuleandra, pardon me, boyar. Ciuleandra. Make room for the gentleman, he wants to join you. What's your name, you wild creature? Madalina. And how else? Crainicu Madalina. And how old are you? Seventeen. How are you? I am well, boyar. Let's dance.If you dance with me this dance, I promise you I let you alone. So be it. Whose daughter is she? Of Maria Crainicu. She is a widow, a very hardworking woman. And the girl? The girl is virgin. Is she? How couldn't she? She is a chid. She should be no more than seventeen. So he died a long time ago? In 1907, pardon me. Call them both. Right now, boyar. The boyar is waiting for you. You, too. Come on, don't be afraid. Dad, I hope you don't think by chance to.. No. No by chance. She is very delicate. All right, girl, you can leave. My father was completely changed, rejuvenated and joyful. Two days later he informed me that we were leaving to Bucharest. Everything here belong to us. And it must be ours for ever. And if we are not strong enough, they will take away from us this estate which belonged to our fathers. We need to have strong, bold offsprings, not weak and powerless ones. Men able to defend the wealth of some generations, understand? Father, for God's sake, you don't want to..? That girl seemed to me the embodiment of the vitality thjat our family needs. I decided. We will embarassed ouselves. She is a peasant, she is really beautiful, but.. I decided, go on. Maria! Please come in. Come in. I kiss your hand, boyar. Please come in. Shut up, Maria. You are very lucky. Come on! Forgive her, boyar. Come in! Sit down, woman. It's disrespectful. Please, sit down. Look what I decided, woman. I want your daughter Madalina to marry my son. I will take care of her upbringing to cope with the world You will receive 50.000 lei and some land. Tomorrow I will send the administrator to tell him what and how much do you want. Why? You pack only the sunday clothes, the ones she has worn at the dance. Why are you mocking us, sir? Forgive her, sir, the joy made her loose her mind. Come on, girl, dress yourself. Don't give me away, mom! Don't give me away! My girl.. We are waiting outside for you to say goodbye to each other. I cannot believe it. You'll get use to it. Don't beat her, sir, because sh'e a good girl. Yes.. I interrupted you because I see that you are too tired. No, doctor, I feel very well. A month later, Madalina was totally unrecognizable. She had become a charming young lady precisely because of her clumsiness. The next day I had changed her name to Madelaine. She didn't object to the changing of name, the same as to anything else. After a month my father accompany her by train to Switzerland, to a boarding school in Zurich Afterwards in Berlin, Vienna, then one year in Paris and another year in London. It's incredible how easily the women adapt. It looked as if Madelaine was born a princess. She had so much grace in all her appearance. so much simplicity and natural in all her gestures and attitude! When she returned home, my father was proud and delighted so he immediately introduced her to the world. and only one night was enough for her to conquer Bucarest. Of course, there was a big difference between the former Madalina the one from Ciuleandra and Madeleine of today. The difference was not only in what it could be seen but especially in her soul. So after our engagement, we have celebrated our wedding four years ago, just after Easter. How could such things be hidden from the world? And why would I hide them? I didn't have any reason to be ashamed of Madeleine just as she didn't have any reason to be ashamed of herself. Thank you. Of course, you are tired now. No, doctor, you did me a great favour, you cannnot even imagine.Thank you. Doctor, I'd like to ask you a favor. I am listening. I'd like to go home tomorrow. Please forgive me, sir, but I didn't know you were coming. It's all right, George, you didn't know. By the order of the minister, nobody entered since then. The electrical installation is broken, but I will bring you some candles. As far I can remeber you said you knew my wife. Yes, it's true, I had the chance. Leave us alone, we don't need you anymore. As you wish. Come on, doctor. She was mine, do you understand? This miracle for which any man would have sacrificed his entire fortune, the honour. She was mine whenever I wanted, at any moment. But I could never pass beyond her gaze, beyond that bright and cold wall. This fact which I never wanted to admit triggered in fact my violence. She was beautiful and maybe that evening was more beautiful than ever. I wanted to blame her for something to make a fuss out of something so we would not leave anymore but my anger was growing precisely because I couldn't find any reason. Madelaine, I love you. I know that after five years of marriage and especially in our world it is not adequate to say it Are you listening to me? I know that you..I know.. but please tell me that you love me.Even if it's not true. Please, tell me only once. Now. That was the moment I lost my temper. She was soft and she didn't resist. For a long time I thought that's how she wanted to take revenge for something she never told me. And she took her secret in the grave. Here in this offoce I found my father. Yes, now I remember. The white carnation was on the desk. It was Madeleine's favourite flower. What does this mean? It's a proof that he loved her. Like a father. Forgive me, doctor. It's true, my father is not capable of loving anyone. He just loves his ideas and himself. That's all. He used to tell me that Madeleine is his own creation. Hello! Leave us alone. All right. Did domething happen, father? Yes, Puiu, very serious. This doctor is a bastard(French) You are exaggerating, father. I decided, I will take any risks to transfer you to another sanatorium. Right now, when I'm starting to feel better? There you will feel even better near some doctors who are more humane and friendly, not like here, enemies. When I brought you here, I counted on Chirileanu in whose care I could leave you with all my confidence. Last night was chatting with professor Dortea at the club. He asked me what you were doing, how you were doing and that's how we got to talk about doctor Aioanei. Dortea knows him perfectly since he was his student. He said that since college he never missed any opportunity to show his hatred towards the privileged people and by privileged people he was meaning all kind of decent people who are not peasants. He might have exaggerated. Not at all. If he told me all this, he did it just to prevent me in a very gracious way. Don't forget, Puiu that your life depends on this doctor, on his report. What greater harm could he do to me, greater than I have already done to myself? To give me a certificate attesting that I was responsible? So what? Would this be a greater catastrophe than Madeleine's death? All right, Puiu.. but don't you think about me? About all those generations that made the name Faranga be honoured and esteemed? There will be a huge trial a political scandal with hundredss of journalists digging the intimacy and the secrets of this family. Do I deserve all this from you? Does the outside world seem of any interest to me from now on? In order to come to terms with this, I should pretend that I'm insane. And that's no longer possible, at any cost, father. I don't want to charge my conscience with this to get rid of the consequences o a murder. I can't and even if I were so vile to want it, I wouldn't know how to pretend, to simulate this. Therefore I will quietly stay here and wait for what is to come. Indeed, you may be right. I'd like to talk to you. Good evening, please. Yes, thank you. I went to my son and I am sincerely, deeply worried. And if I add to this what you have already told me over the phone about his injury my state it is totally justified. Have you noticed any bad changes in your son's condition? Unfortunately, I have to say yes, This growing restlessness, this strange look.. As a father I am asking you to give him an adequate cure. I've been reading lately about new methods that seemed very successful You mean shock therapies? Exactly. Minister, for these methods I need your written consent. We usually use these methods in certain forms of schizophrenia In certain cases they are successful. However I must draw your attention to the fact that in some cases the desease can assume an unforeseen form I know. I signed. In your village they dance "Ciuleandra", Grigore? Yes, sir, only that we call it "Suleandra". A complicated dance. There must be very good dancers and musicians who also know how to dance. Have you ever dance it? Of course I did, how could I not? I torn so many pair of boots! Amazing dance! I also dance it once, at Varzari That's when I chose my wife, the one that I strangled.. Understand? When they dance Ciuleandra, almost all men get married. The meet the girls they like, hug and dance until they lose their minds Listen, Grigore, can you whistle Ciuleandra? Forgive me, Sir.I don't have this skill, I don't know how to whistle. Too bad. I whished to see how are you dancing it. I would sing the song but I don't remember it. Sir, this wouldn't be appropriate, Ciuleandra is a dance that equires a lot of jumping and I am too old for it. It's a dance for young people. I wasted my energy during the war and during my whole life. You're a fool. You brag that you know a lot of things and you don't know anything! Forgive me, sir.. It's getting late.The oother gentlemen in the other rooms are actually ill, unlike you. Turn off the light! I didn't want to kill her! I didn't want! Is it day or night? It is day, sir. Tell me, Grigore did I dream or is it there a portrait of my wife in my room? You didn't dream, sir, you asked for it and the minister brought it to you Some time ago. Yes, that's right. We are getting out of here soon, Grigore God help you sir. We are leaving this place, anywhere. We are getting rid of the doctor, too. He is kind of grumpy. I think that he behaves badly with the staff, too. You can notice the vail man from the first sighr. Even the folks here are surprised by his harshness. Especially since he is a peasant's son. That's what I heard, too. The cook told me he had known him since he was in school He is from a poor family from Arges county How come, from Arges? Yes, from a village I went, too, its name is Varzari. Varzari, you say? It's just one village with this name. Varzari...strange thing.. Doctor aren't you from Varzari village? The place where I danced Ciuleandra and I have met Madalina? Yes, so what? That means that when I talked about your village, about your dance.. And what do you think, sir, that I, also, had to make any confessions to you? Let's not cchange the roles. My questions about your past helps me better to understand your crime. That's all, mr Faranga. From your stories I could document your medical report. For example, Ciuleandra. I am convinced that Ciuleandra plays a very important role in your story. Doctor, I want to ask you something. Tell me. But I don't dare. Dance Ciuleandra once more. Like the last time. Should I dance Ciuleandra? You are wrong, sir. I never dance it. Someone wants to see you, that's why I called you. I am sorry, but.. It's your wife's mother. I'm Madalina's mother. I am sick, woman. You have to talk to my father he will give you money and everything you want! That's not why I came, sir. money.. I came to give me back my Madalina. All right, but.. she is dead. I know, sir. You killed her. I don't know why she upset you as she was a good girl. Doctor, please.. I am to blame, I give her to you. But the other siblings? Tell me, sir, you are an educated man... how should I raise them? Doctor, do you think these scene is good for me? I came to help me move Madalina's grave to our village because she asked me not to gave her and I gave her away. At least her grave, dear daughter, should not be among the strangers. We need to get rid of this doctor Aioanei Yes, so? I ordered an investigation. He seeks revenge. He is the teacher's son, that one too was a wreched rebel. He was.. He loved Madeleine They were to get married. Puiu do you understand? Your life is in your hands We must leave from here at once! I talked with.. Puiu! Yes, I loved her. I loved her a lot. I loved her as a sister and as a wife, too. I knew her single thought. She liked to read, did you know? She wanted to become a teacher In the evening we used to watch the steam of the plain and dreamed. And her gase was nor empty and deserted. You killed her not when you strangled her, sir but when you bought her like a cattle Now I know, doctor I know everything. You were there when we danced and when I kissed Madalina You were there and she was looking at you! I remember so well! Is it true, doctor? Soon after that I have had the premonition that a great disgrace would happen to me. When you came again, I wasn't at home and you took her away. But fate once led me to run into your wife. I was introduced to her like any other stranfer. She startled and I kissed her hand. From her eyes, I understood that she hadn't forgotten me and that she would change all her successes and wealth for that village we once dreamed of. Now I know why I strangled her, doctor. I only killed her because of you! Only because of you! You didn't know I existed. I didn't know, but I felt you When I understood that she will remain a stranger forever and rather than being someone else's I preferred to smash her. So, Mr Faranga not knowing and not wanting, you were the killer of my happiness. Obviously, you are not to be blamed but you were the tool of destiny which worked against me I understand that my life is in your hands. You want revenge. Me? On you? To take revenge?

Please come outside! Did something happen, mr Faranga? Are you not feeling well? No, doctor,I feel very well. I want that farce to finish once and for all. I want that everything ends that's why I came to you, to declare on my conscience and on my word of hinir that I'm not insane. And for wwhat I did, I want to be punished Yes.. I want you to note that I'm not crazy Of course that you're not insane but I want you to remember that you are not my patient, too. Accompany mr Faranga. He thinks I won't remember.
