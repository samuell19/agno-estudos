The White Lotus Cult rose when the Empress Dowager was in power and the Imperial Court was weak, and the Western nations eyed China with hostility. The cult sprang up under the pretext of wiping out foreigners. So the fortune-teller's prediction was correct. He said my trip akin to a waning moon is a bad omen. Don't be superstitious. I wouldn't have brought you along if I'd known you were dissatisfied. Had your boss not been so miserly and put us into the truck like goods, it wouldn't have been so bad. Make way! Bloody foreigner! Rushing back to hell? Kuang, don't get involved. - Big Brother, are you all right? - Yes. Herd! Come here! Get out of the way immediately! - Get out of the way! - Herd! Go away! The dog is going to bite someone! Get out of the way! Go away! Move! Let go! You asked for it! The Chinese are all pigs! Let go! Foreigners fired! Foreigners fired! Big Brother! White Lotus descend to Earth to support the government, annihilate foreigners! Give me divine power and save the masses! - Are you all right? - Yes, thank you. Terrific! Who are those people in white? The White Lotus Cult. Fire! Left Green Dragon. - Right White Tiger. - Divine Power Body Protection. Divine Power Body Protection. It's magical! - The officers are here! - The officers are here! Let's get out of here. Let's go! - Let's go! - Run! Quickly! White Lotus will save the masses with their paramount strength! How dare you incite trouble in the Imperial City? Get out of here! We're under orders from Empress Dowager Cixi... To dispel foreigners and to protect the Qing unity! Get out of my sight or I'll put you in jail and make an example of you! Get out of here immediately! White Lotus is powerful, it can save the masses. White Lotus has great skills. You Chinese have injured our officer! Careful. The foreigners hurt you. Let's sue them. No, it's pointless. We civilians can't fight against foreigners. Buddy, get out of here quickly! Big Brother, don't get involved! We still need to make that delivery. We demand an immediate apology from Lee Hung-Chang. - Left Green Dragon. - Right White Tiger. Bring heavenly soldiers. Then black evil gods. Invite all omnipotent gods to protect descendants of White Lotus. - Please come out, Chief. - Please come out, Chief. - Please come out, Chief. - Please come out, Chief. - Please come out, Chief. - Please come out, Chief. - Come out!

Come out! - The Chief is valiant and invincible! - The Chief is valiant and invincible! - The Chief is valiant and invincible! - The Chief is valiant and invincible! - The Chief is valiant and invincible! - The Chief is valiant and invincible! - The Chief is valiant and invincible! - The Chief is valiant and invincible! - The Chief is valiant and invincible! - The Chief is valiant and invincible! - The Chief is valiant and invincible! - The Chief is valiant and invincible! - The Chief is valiant and invincible! - The Chief is valiant and invincible! - The Chief is valiant and invincible! - The Chief is valiant and invincible! Eunuch Tsao. I was focusing on alchemy, so I didn't notice you were coming. Thank you for your devotion to making pills for the Empress Dowager. This is for you, Tsao. The one for Empress Dowager takes a little longer to make. And this pill... Tsao, this is the same as Empress Dowager's. It won't let you down. Good. Any information for me this time, Tsao? Many court ministers scruple about you. The Emperor is upset too, so the Empress wants to alert you, or... Everything I do is for the good of the Qing Court. I'm devoted to Empress Dowager. I know, but now the villain is in power. Be aware of it. I must leave now. Thank you, Tsao. - Boss King? - Everything is fine. Thank you. How's your leg? - I am fine, thank you. - You did good. He did a brilliant job. Dad, are you all right? I'm fine. Dad, you need to take care of yourself. I'm very capable, but I'm held back by this ailment. Dad, you're out of snuff tobacco. Let me buy some for you. That won't be necessary. I decided long ago to quit it, so give me the chance to do it. Hey, get some medicine for your dad. All right. I'll give you a chance. We're lucky that our cargo arrived intact. You two brought such valuable cargo to the capital all the way from Kwangtung. It's better to not go against any foreigners. My big brother is powerful and fearless! - You don't need to worry! - You'd better shut up. Why did you push me? Take some ginseng to your boss when you return to Kwangtung. Aren't you afraid we may eat it ourselves? Hey, the boss trusted you with this delivery from Kwangtung. I should trust you too, right? But the kid with you seems up to no good. Be careful with him. - He needs ginseng then, right? - I... He's like my brother. If you don't trust him, then you don't trust me either. I won't transport that cargo for you. It would be great if we didn't go back. I can stay here to start a business. I was only joking. What's wrong with you? If you won't deliver this for me, who will help me get this ginseng to your boss? Don't worry. I'm Liang Kun, a man of honor. I'll deliver this cargo to Boss Li as promised. And I'll deliver it in full. Thank you so much. Kuang? Kuang! Fresh, have one bowl! - What's this called? - Roasted wheat flour. Good job! Roasted wheat flour. Sugar coated fruit. Give me one. Thank you. Sugar coated fruit. Miss, would you like one dough figurine? The dough is delicious. - I'd like this one. - Ok. Girls love beautiful things. I'll pick a handsome boy for you. My dad's a military man. I'm buying this for him. All right. Great! Excuse me! Boss, they are all here. Boss, please make the prescription for me. - I want this one! - Ok. One, please. - Little one, don't touch my figurines! - We just... - My son wants one. - You can't have it! - I'll pay you. - I don't sell my wares to foreigners. I'll pay you. Why won't you sell it to me? - I don't like you foreigners! - Don't do that! - Why not? Sell me one! - You evil foreigners! - I won't sell you it! - I want one! What a brave old man! - Sugar coated fruit. - Baby, don't cry. Come on. Here, you can have mine. - Thank you. - It's fun. Here. Boss, one bowl, please. You run a stand over there, don't you? Why come to our place? If everybody buys your flour dolls, what about my noodles? For me, I despise those foreigners with their red hair and green eyes. Those foreigners drink human blood! I won't sell my dolls to them. That's great, but why have you come here? Are you afraid of them? How embarrassing. - I'm afraid of them? - Yes. This is fun. Hey, stop! - You foreigners are thieves! - What are you doing? - You stole my flour doll! - What are you doing? This is his doll. What are you doing? Why did you take it away? Be my witnesses! This doll is mine, and this foreigner stole it. He stole it! I didn't sell it to him. What are you talking about? You are crazy. Give it back to me. This belongs to my kid. - Dare to beat me? - Keep away. - Ouch! - Don't use violence. Let me tell you! A lady gave this to my kid! We didn't steal it. Bloody foreigner, you're a bully! Time to impersonate. Please don't do that! Don't be afraid, everyone. The White Lotus descendant is here. I will make him confess. You foreigners dare to steal. Give it back! Give it back! Give it back! Give it back! Excuse me. Everyone, calm down! I gave this doll to the kid. How dare you side with a foreigner? Let's get her! Listen, there are good foreigners and bad foreigners. They don't play tricks like the White Lotus does. Don't defend him! You dare act this way in front of a Cult priest? Give it to me! I've got her. Now beat up that foreigner! Kuang! Stop! I recognize this. - I know this doll belongs to this lady. - She... You're talking nonsense! You're barbarians. Bitch! - He's siding with that bitch. Get him! - You don't understand! He is my bro. - Why did he defend foreigners? - Don't get it wrong! White Lotus descends to Earth to help Qing wipe out foreigners! Grant me divine power to save the masses! White Lotus descends to Earth to help Qing wipe out foreigners! The White Lotus is here. It's not safe here. The White Lotus is here. Grant me divine power to save the masses. Quickly! White Lotus descends to Earth to help Qing wipe out foreigners! Miss, your purse! Big Brother! Miss! Grant me divine power to save the masses. - Miss! - Big bro! Big bro! Big bro! Stop! You're an impostor! - You've got nerve. - But I helped you fight the foreigners! - How dare you pose as us! - Help! Stop! Get on your knees in the presence of Emperor Qing. The envoys of the White Lotus greet Your Majesty. The Empress wants you to dampen foreigners' prowess only, not use violence so casually. Your behavior is a disgrace to this nation. I'm in charge of foreign affairs, and this reflects badly on me. Keke's skating pose is really beautiful. How agile. - His Majesty is here! - Hurry up! Hurry up! His Majesty is here! Your Majesty. Arise. Sire, don't catch a cold. It's cold by the lake, be careful. I'd like to discuss something with the Dowager. Sire, now is not a good time. She's learning how to skate. Please go back to the palace. I'll give her your message. Empress, how was my skating? Not bad. Thank you, Empress. In fact, I work so hard. I'd like to try it and have some fun. Give me a hand. - Be careful, Empress. - Empress, easy. - Empress! - Are you all right? Your Majesty, His Majesty is here. He might have important affairs to discuss with you. He always comes to bother me when I'm having a good time. - Li? - Your Majesty. - Greetings, Queen Mother. - You may rise. What is it, my dear? Mother, the White Lotus has been encouraged to attack people in the capital. They bewitch people, flout the law and try to kill the foreigners. If this continues, the Western powers may have an excuse to invade us. I can't believe you'd say something like that as Emperor. You boost other people's morale and reduce our own courage! That was not my intention. However, I do think that we shouldn't impulsively enable these disorderly people to cause a bad relationship with foreigners. My dear... don't you know that the foreigners are showing how arrogant they are? The White Lotus is doing us a favor. They are doing justice. How can you call it trouble? - But, Mother... - That's enough! You're such a killjoy. Keke, let's continue our lesson. As you wish. - Li, go and talk to the Chief Chan. - Yes. Tell him to show a little restraint. Behave themselves. Understood. Who dared to complain about me to His Majesty? It wasn't me, Chief! Chief! Chief! Chief, look closely. It's me. Practicing the White Lotus Classic affects my blood circulation. Nobody must know. I will keep your secret. Is there any news about my brother, Jin Zhen? I'll have them look for him. He's the only one who can cure me. If you can find him, it'd be an asset to the Cult. I'd give you a sizable reward. I might even teach you the White Lotus techniques. Thank you, Chief! Customers are here! - Why'd you leave? - Go on! RED SUN RISES FROM THE EAST WHITE LOTUS The White Lotus greets Cult Uncle. What did you say? I'm not your uncle. Uncle, don't deny it. I am not mistaken. You're the legendary iron lock, Chin Chen. Let's go. Uncle, don't make things difficult. The Chief is here! - The Chief is valiant and invincible! - The Chief is valiant and invincible! - The Chief is valiant and invincible! - The Chief is valiant and invincible! Brother, your skills are as good as ever. I'm unworthy to be your brother. You're the Empress Dowager's new baron. I'm no match for you. Big brother, I think you misunderstood me. Let's not talk about it here. Let's discuss it in front of our altar. Show Uncle the way now. Uncle, this way please. - Tieh, go home. - No, Dad. Do as I say. Let's go! This altar is our secret holy ground. DEFEAT QING RESTORE MING BANISH MANCHUS Outsiders aren't allowed in here. The pupil is here to worship the master. Master. Big Brother. I'm only pretending to be loyal to the Empress Dowager. I want to win her trust. When the occasion arises, I'll strike. The Court is a mess with her in power. This is a rare opportunity for us to revive the glory of the Ming Dynasty. We'll succeed or die trying. Are you really against the Qing? Here's my plan to assassinate the Empress Dowager. I'm seizing this chance to wipe out the Qing lackeys. Brother, we nearly have everything we need. All we need now is someone skilled in kung fu. I hope you can shoulder the responsibility of slaying her and return the land to the Han. Brother, remember the vow we made before the founder? - To the founder, your pupil Chin Chen. - Your pupil Chan. We vow to vanquish the Qing lackeys. Someday, we'll expel the tartans and revive the Han power. All right, I give you my word. That's splendid. Brother, show me our master's White Lotus Classic. Let's practice together to accomplish this noble goal. No, I cannot. Master said that only the head of our faction can read the Classic. Let's discuss that later. Now, let's discuss how to murder that old witch. Your Majesty, this character has good skills. Time's up. The train's leaving soon. Take your tickets. Hurry up! Get in quickly. Show me your ticket. Don't rush. Dad has important affairs to attend to. Take a train to Canton and find Ms. Hong. Take this snuffbox and letter to her. This is strictly confidential. Here. Be alert and take care. Hurry up! Get in the train. An assassin! Protect the Dowager! SING, DANCE, AND ENJOY - Capture the assassin! - Protect the Dowager! The train is ready to go! Wait for me! Miss, your ticket? - Hey! Ticket, please. - Here. Go now! Stop! - Do you have a ticket? - Sorry, I'm in a hurry. - Do me a favor. I'm in a hurry. - No ticket, no entering. No way. Please, I beg you. All right. Go through. Come here. Excuse me! Excuse me! - What's wrong with you? - Sorry, I need to catch the train. My goods are all over the place. - You need to pay me. Don't run! - I am sorry. Miss! Miss! Capture the assassin! Over there! Don't let him get away! Capture the assassin! Over there, hurry! You betrayed me! Yes, Chin Chen. My plot had two purposes in mind. To gain credit from the Empress and to kill you. Stop dreaming, Chan, I won't give you the Classic even at death's door. The poison has entered your heart due to overuse. Stop dreaming about getting the Classic. Over there! Quickly! This way! Quickly! Go! Listen, this criminal is wanted by the Court. Report any strangers to us. - Nice buns! They're oven fresh. - I want one. Nice buns! You're my dinner tonight. Tell them to stop that train and search for the criminal! Stop that train! - Hurry! - Stop the train! - Stop the train! - What's going on? The Empress Dowager ordered us to capture that criminal. Search the train. What is all this about? Let's go inside. Stay aside. What's going on? - Get up! - What happened? Who are you? Help me. Check the goods compartment. - What are you doing? - I'm in charge of the cargo. Go away. I'm in charge of the cargo. You... Nothing is suspicious here. Don't search my goods. That's just medicine. There's nothing else there. I cannot find anything here. Let's go to the next one. - Quickly. - Go! Stay in your seat. Get out of the way. Easy. We can't wait for any longer, sir. A delay will put the national train behind schedule. And I might be beheaded if I go back empty-handed! - We didn't find anything, sir. - Idiot! Try elsewhere. Follow me! - Can I leave now? - Start the train. Quickly. How can you vomit on this? This is ginseng! It is very expensive. It doesn't belong to me. What should I do? I am screwed. Hey! Don't eat it, it is expensive! Give me that ginseng! You're so ungrateful. I just saved you! And you ate my ginseng! What am I gonna do? This ginseng can save my life. And I'm going to die if you eat that ginseng! I don't have money to pay for it. What can I do about it? Buddy, that's enough! You're so ungrateful! I'll report you at the next stop! Only I have the antidote to this poison. If you report me, we both die. The Chief's brother attempted to assassinate the Empress! His kung fu was terrific. - Even the Chief was wounded. - I think... Who dared to say I was wounded? Anyone who claims the killer was my brother will suffer the same fate. - The Chief is valiant and invincible! - The Chief is valiant and invincible! Chief, Chin Chen is missing. But someone saw his daughter leave for Canton. Canton? Here is the imperial decree! Chan, receive the decree. EMPRESS' DECREE "By order of the Empress Dowager, "Chief Chan's White Lotus Cult is to be honored as a state cult "and rewarded with 1,000 taels of gold and silk for protecting the monarch. "I hope the cult can strengthen the state, Her Majesty." Thank you, Your Majesty. Please keep the gold and silk for me, Tsao. You are so modest, Chief. Please let Her Majesty know that I've heard that the killer's daughter has left for Canton. I will head there to chase her tomorrow. Arresting the killer is the court's duty. Don't bother, Chief. Actually I am going there too. The White Lotus Cult is now a state cult. So, I shall return home to worship and thank to my ancestor. You should, but don't clash with the court. Many of the princes scruple about you. Thanks for your advice, Tsao. Don't move too much. That poison is quite effective. Are you in pain? Yes, my chest hurts. My chest hurts badly. Listen to me. I am truly in pain. Bend down. Put your hands on the ground and do a handstand. Well? It's all up to you. Be focused and listen to your heart. Breathe in, let the air go to your abdomen, out to your toes. KAO'S FAMILY INN - Come buy tofu! - I'm selling umbrellas! Come buy tofu! Come buy tofu! Go away. What are you looking at? - Miss, do you know how I can get here? - Sorry, I don't know. Let me see it... Miss, I know the way. I'll take you there. Come! Get on the tricycle. Get out of the way! Make way! Get out of the way! Get out of the way! - What are you doing? - Make way! Get out of the way! Go away, neighbor! Good, stay aside! Here you are, miss. That'll be three cents. Miss, it's haunted here. No one dares to come around here. Take care. I am off now. Why are you here? Are you a Qing lackey? No, no, I've come to visit Hong. Why do you visit her? My dad told me to come here. - Who is your dad? - Chin Chen. At last, I've heard from him again. What did you just say? Chin Chen is your father? - Is he? - Yes, he is. I've waited for him for over ten years! Turns out he's married. And he has a grown-up daughter. Hong, my dad asked me to give you this letter. I won't read it! Now get out. You and your dad are no good! Hong, you're my elder, so you may scold me. But you can't do this to my dad. NOODLES The White Lotus is in Canton! Help Qing wipe out foreigners, grant me divine power... Quickly, serve the guest. Miss, this fabric is beautiful. What's going on outside? The White Lotus descends to Earth to help Qing wipe out foreigners! Grant me divine power to save the masses! FABRIC STORE - Quickly. - Help Qing wipe out foreigners! - Make way! - Driver! - Where to? - Quickly! Anywhere will do. - Make way! - Hurry! ...to save the masses.

Let's go there! Tieh. Tieh... Are you all right? You're still here? Are you afraid I won't give you the antidote? You're judging my heart with your cynicism. I was afraid you'd die if there was no one to look after you. Here, drink this. What kind of medicine is this? I bought some herbs for your wound. Drink it. There's a strong smell of ginseng. I make it with extra ginseng. Let's see what's next. I'll just apologize to the boss. You're so kind. You didn't expect that, huh? Anyway, give me the antidote. Antidote? - There's no more antidote. - What? It can't be! Give me the antidote right now! I said there's none! - You must have some. Give it to me! - I said no! Damn, old man! You can fight even while injured. You're badly wounded. Killing you wouldn't be heroic. You are a true hero. The skill I taught you... do as you're told and the poison will gradually dissolve. What did you say? The skill you taught me on the train? It's working. Tell me how to do it again. Put your hands on the ground and do a handstand. Breathe in, let air go to the abdomen, Be focused and listen to your heart. I, Governor Fan Kuo-hung, greet the newly honored Chief of Qing's White Lotus Cult... by Empress Dowager. Greetings to the White Lotus Chief. - Greetings to the Chief. - Greetings to the Chief. Please come out, Chief. Our cult venerates the White Lotus, why are there so many red lanterns? You dare overshadow our cult? They are just there to welcome you. If you don't like them, I can have them switched. Remove the red lanterns and replace them with white ones. That's outrageous. - White lanterns are used for funerals. - Switch to white lanterns. - How dare you insult my cult! - I wouldn't dare. Today's a happy day for us, so I won't kill anyone. Pull out his tongue! WHITE LOTUS I came to Kwangtung to pay respects to my ancestor. My other mission is to arrest the Empress Dowager's assassin. Blockade the ports to stop that criminal from escaping via the sea. I'm in charge of affairs in Kwangtung and Kwangsi. But the responsibility for sea blockades lies with Admiral Kuan. He takes orders from the Military Command. I can't do anything. Tell him to hand over military power. He's stubborn. He only obeys orders from the Military Command. Insolence! I'm the Chief of the State cult. How dare a petty admiral go against my wishes? Kuan, come out here! General Kuan isn't here. What? Aren't all the officers here to welcome me? - General Kuan... - Tell him to come to see me tomorrow. He said the White Lotus is just a religious group. Kuan, you've got some guts! There's no admittance to the admiral's quarters. The White Lotus is powerful and famous! It helps Qing wipe out foreigners and is powerful! The chief descends to Earth! The chief descends to Earth! Tell Kuan to come here! He's busy and won't see anyone without an appointment. Well, it's up to him. Hand over the seal! As of today, I am in charge of the navy. I'm here. Now, who dares to take my seal? Admiral, Chief, please stop. Please stop, for my sake. How could I bear the blame if you two suffer any injuries? Tell him to blockade the sea! I won't do anything without orders from the Military Department. I'm here under orders from the Empress Dowager to arrest a convict. Where's the decree? Why were there no orders from the Military Department? Admiral, the White Lotus is an honored cult. They're here under secret orders. Then it has nothing to do with me. See them out. They only wheel and deal. - Insolence! - Please calm down, Chief. He's the Emperor's baron. Even the Empress has to concede somewhat to him. Let's go back and come up with a good plan. We'll then act on your orders. - The Chief is valiant and invincible! - Let's go back! Let's go. Miss, let me wash those clothes myself. It's fine, you've done me a big favor. How else can I repay you? Let me do something for you. Here, let me help you. He's one lucky guy. This is great, An. You stunk because you didn't wash your clothes. - Now someone can help you do it! - Mind your own business! I'm just saying. - You are so annoying! - Don't get mad. Let me wash your linens too. - Wash mine first! - Wash mine first! Take them back. Wash these for me! Thank you. And mine too. Take them back! ...descends to Earth to help Qing wipe out foreigners. The cult is so powerful. - The White Lotus descends to Earth... - White Lotus' amulets are divine. - The cult is so powerful. - An amulet grants you peace! Look, isn't that Kuang? - It's nonsense. - It is true. Listen to him! Neighbors and elders, buy an amulet! These amulets will protect you. Buy them now! You misunderstood me! - You misunderstood me! - Why did you do that? What's all the excitement? Brother, you are back. The herb shop owner is looking for you. What took you so long? I lost the cargo and I must work for him the rest of my life. Why were you so careless? Miss. Miss, you dropped this purse. - Thank you. - So you know each other? We saw each other in Beijing. You know each other then. You're sly! ...help Qing wipe out foreigners. The cult is so powerful. It's Kuang. How are you, my brothers? I was caught by the cult but it turned out to be a blessing. I became a leader now! - Can we join the cult too? - Kuang! - Hey, brother, what's up? - Not much. Can we join the cult too, Kaung? Yes, we want to join too. Normal people are not allowed to join. But I will recommend you guys. Think it over. Don't do anything you'll regret. Big Brother, you still don't believe in our cult? We saved the empress's life and were honored as a state cult. Look at my... divine power! Wow, that's amazing. What are you doing? All right. Brother, are you all right? I've been poisoned. - Don't worry, swallow this amulet. - Back off! - What now? - Let's check on him. With my grand homecoming, I'll buy you a treat. - You must come. - Sorry, I'm busy. Maybe next time. Don't be a killjoy. I will solve your poisoning issue. Our chief is supreme. He'll get you an antidote. WANTED What does that say? Listen, this guy tried to murder Empress Dowager. But our chief defeated him. The Governor has given us orders to arrest him. Is that so? Hey, brother? - Have you seen him? - Brother... Wait for me at Ta San Yuan. I'll be right there. Ok, we'll meet you there. Let's go. Mr. Chin? Mr. Chin! You're a wanted man. Don't leave this place. Mr. Chin, how is your wound? I'm seriously wounded. Only my faction's chi can cure it. Then what should we do? Help me find a member of my faction. Her name is Hong. I also have a daughter. Her name is Tieh. Tieh? Got it. Don't worry. Here, have this rice dumpling. I'll go find them for you. Just don't go outside. Hong? Hong? Who are you? That's my question too. How can I speak like this? All right. You can speak now. What should I say? - Don't play dumb with me! - Fine! I'll talk. I'm Liang Kun. Mr. Chin wanted me to ask you about his daughter. Did he teach you our faction's chi? What are you talking about? I don't think he would do that. I'll be thankful to God if he doesn't kill me. His daughter is not here. Why did he send you here? He wanted you to see him. To see him? I won't see him anymore. Are you going to abandon him? What do you mean? He's seriously wounded and needs your help. He's seriously wounded? Impossible. His daughter came here and she didn't mention it. It's true. He was injured after his daughter left. She wouldn't have known. Are the two of you trying to trick me? I won't be fooled. I'm stuck in a tough situation because of him. Why would I trick you? You're a really good actor. Actor? I could die of poisoning at any moment! You were poisoned? Chin Chen did this. You'll kill me if you don't help him. - Still trying to trick me? - I am not! You're not poisoned, and you're full of our faction's chi. I'm not poisoned? I'm trembling and have a fever. Isn't that a sign of poisoning? Don't believe me? Try to jump up high and you'll see. Really? You can't jump high because you don't control your breath properly. If you did, you could jump much higher. He didn't trick me then. He's still in that dilapidated temple! He might not make it. - So he really is seriously wounded? - Yes, I wasn't lying to you. Go there right now! He could die if there's any further delay. All right. Lead the way. He's inside. Mr. Chin? Mr. Chin? You lied to me. He was right here! I wonder where he is. - You're lying! - I'm not! Let me find him. What are you doing? Forget it. Next time I see you, you will be dead. Where is the White Lotus Classic? Tell me now! Are you going to tell me? I will take it to my grave. The poison has penetrated your heart. Your veins will explode in 49 days. We will die together! I want you to be in utter misery. - Search the house! - I don't know where he went. I really don't know where he is. What happened? They say that Tieh is a wanted criminal. - Tieh? - Do you know this person? He just came from Beijing and knows nothing about it. Let's go. Follow me. What's going on? Kuang found criminal Chin Chen at a temple and captured him. Captured Chin Chen? Attention everyone, let's celebrate for Kuang. He's got our back. Cheers! Not too loud. The chief may behead me if he hears it. Cheers! Let's toast. Brother, you're here! Come and sit down. Brother, come and have a drink. We are waiting for you. - We've been waiting for you. - Join us for a drink. Come outside! - Tell me over a drink. - Let's talk outside! Why are you so rude? You disrespect me! Never mind. Let's have another drink. - Kuang, go and see what happened. - Yes. Go talk with him. You guys continue drinking. I'll check in with him. What happened? - What's the matter with them? - I don't know. - I didn't see him mad like that. - Let's go outside. Let's all go together. Big Brother, what is it? You bastard! You followed me! You reported to the White Lotus and capture Mr. Chin, didn't you? All I know about him is that he's a royal convict. I did what was right. Is that a crime? We're brothers. Show me some respect! Did you know that they will kill him? He's a criminal! He deserves it. The White Lotus executes the justice of heaven. Shut up! The White Lotus? You are a strange bunch. You just bluff and deceive people. Enough! Stop insulting our holy cult! Make me! Liang Kun, I'll give you a second chance because we're brothers. What did you say? Next time you insult our cult again, I will kill you myself. Kuang, I've been your brother for over 10 years. You want to kill me because of this cult? Big Brother? I'm the 28th team leader of the White Lotus Cult. They call me Leader Kuang! Who do you think you are? I only call you "brother" because I respect you. Or else I would just call you Liang Kun the Driver. Kuang, don't be misled. Misled? Every man has the right to pursue his dream. Unlike you, I won't be a driver all my life. - Kuang... - That's enough. From now on, we shall go our separate ways. Don't mind him. Let's go back and have a drink. Hey, you guys. - Come on. Let's go. - Just ignore him. Let's go. An, you're a good friend. Let's have another drink, huh? Let's go. Are you all right? That was your food. I'm returning it. An! Go! Bunch of chickens! Close the windows. Be careful on the way home. Good, good. Uh-oh, it's so high up. I should use that technique I learned. It worked! Come with me. - Why are you here? - I'm here to save your dad. Me too. - Do you know any martial arts? - No, I don't. Too bad. I'm not very good either. What should we do? What then? You go outside and wait for me in the woods, all right? Let's go! WHITE LOTUS IS THE ONLY HOLY CULT Don't let them escape! Let's go! This way! - Stop! - Catch them! Quickly! Mr. Chin! Dad! - Tieh. - Dad! Are you all right? - Sit down and rest. - Let's take a rest. That old traitor tortured you so badly. - I will avenge you! - Tieh... Tieh, I'm all right. Don't be impulsive. Have you found Hong for me? I did, but she's a bit cranky. She even tore up your letter. Yes, she's weird and enjoys using violence. That's enough for now. Did you give her my snuffbox? I didn't give it to her due to her strange behavior. Tieh, give me the box. The White Lotus Classic is inscribed on this. Please keep this for me and don't lose it. Master? It's you. He has another lover. Why are you helping him? I'm not helping him. I'm helping the Master to purge and punish you! Dad, how are you feeling? Tieh, I've suffered heavy injuries. I won't survive for long. Dad, don't say that! You're going to be all right. Mr. Chin, you will survive. Brother, I'm sorry I dragged you into this. Don't say that. Tieh is the one I'm most worried about. You're still alive! Don't say these things. Let's discuss how to deal with Chan. Listen, we've both suffered internal injuries. We can't beat him. What then? He'll come to us sooner or later. If you and I work together, we may stand a chance. You can't. You're badly injured. I didn't mean that you and I fight personally. Instead, we bestow our kung fu skills on someone else. Me? Tieh knows nothing about kung fu. And... you've eaten our faction's golden pill. I can't. You won't? You're lucky that we want to teach you kung fu! Don't you want to be my student? - Yes. Greeting to my masters. - I am not your master! Hong... You've swallowed my pill. Maybe your skills will improve. Upper body stays high. Lower, relaxed. Medium, steady. An unsteady lower body disturbs the stance and affects breathing. Work hard to improve this or you may tumble to your death. Keep the air in your body and remain calm. When you're filled with air, you're peaceful. If chi is not dispersed, then it forms and accumulates. Chi is dispersed in the air, accumulate air or you will have zero chi. If the head's seven apertures are clear, everything is bright. WANTED Who are these people? Liang Kun is wanted. That's our brother Liang Kun! Why did he become a criminal? What does it say? It says "Wanted, Liang Kun." Out of the way! Out of the way! Catch Chin Tieh! Catch Liang Kun! Catch Liu Cui Hong! Catch Chin Chen! Catch Chin Tieh! Catch Liang Kun! HAI SHUN HALL If any of you sees Liang Kun, please report it to the magistracy. None of you should harbor these wanted criminals. Anybody doing so would be considered a guilty party. Kuang, you have gone too far! - Go away! - Liang Kun has been like your brother! It's a false accusation! Why did you do that? So what? I am doing this for justice. Now, go away or I'll arrest you too! Oh, I remember now. He transported the convict's daughter. Yes, I remember that too! You know that girl? Speak up! You're crazy! How could I remember every single passenger? Stop! Get him! Catch him! Stop! Quickly! Stop! Rushing to hell? An? An, what are you doing? Don't stop me. Give me some money. - Lend me some money. - I don't have money. - I will return the money! - Why... An, where are you going? - Where is the criminal? - Kuang, An is on the run. Help him! Out of my way! Follow him! Don't let him get away! Stop! You have nowhere to go! - Where is that girl? - I don't know, I really don't. Tell me or I'll beat you up! You asked for it! Master, I did it! Master, are you all right? Master! Dad! - Master, are you all right? - Dad, wake up! He exhausted all of his skills. His veins are all ruptured. Dad! - God! Don't do that. - Stop it. Tell me or don't! Show a little mercy! Kuang, I'm an old man. I've watched you two grow up. For my sake, - let him go. - Who let him get in here? - Drag him out! - Get out! Kuang, let him go! He's tough. He won't talk, even if you try to kill him. Let him go! Let's see how tough you are. Bring him here! Douse him with water! Let me see. I know this place, miss. I'll take you there. Damn you! Spit it out right now! Or I'll kill you! Butcher him! We're brothers... - Search the place. - Let's go! We didn't find anything. Bastard, how dare you trick me! I didn't! They must be here. - The Chief is valiant and invincible! - Enough! Chin Chen! I want Chin Chen! Master, I will avenge you. Liang Kun, as of today, forget vengeance. But I've already mastered White Lotus kung fu. If you could defeat Chan so easily... then my 30 years of training would have been in vain. Master, you mean... You've taken our pill and made rapid progress, but it will take a lot longer to defeat Chan. I can't wait any longer. I must kill that traitor myself. I've said everything I can. Now it's up to you two. You are no kin to me. Your survival doesn't concern me. Master! I'm not your master. Only Chin Chen would take on such a stupid student. Now I give the White Lotus Classic to you. If I die, avenge my death after you've mastered this. Don't go! It's suicide. My father is dead. My life no longer has any meaning. Then I'll go with you. I don't want to lead you to your death. If you want to honor me, remember what I said. I won't let you go there! I might not know kung fu, but my dad did teach me how to defend myself. I'll use a poisoned needle to kill him and avenge my father. But... Tieh... Master! Master! Master! Master, Tieh has gone to kill Chan! - Come with me. We'll help her. - No, I won't go. - Why not? - We're not able to defeat Chan. If you and Tieh are both killed, Chin Chen won't be able to rest in peace. If Tieh dies? A reckless person is useless, even if they live. She's not reckless! She just wants to avenge her father. Death is nothing to fear. The pain is over in an instant. You're a hero if you dare to kill him. I can't let Tieh be killed. She's sealed her fate. Even if she survives, Chan will capture her. Go after her and you'll be falling into his trap. - I don't care! I must save her. - Don't go! Master! Chan, I'm offering you the White Lotus Classic in exchange for the antidote to cure my father. Chin Chen and Hong each have a pill. Why come to me? My dad took both of those pills, but he needs another one. He was seriously injured. All right. But first, give me that snuffbox. The box was damaged, but I've memorized the Classic. Give me the antidote and I'll recite it to you. Show me the Classic. I'll recite half of it now. I'll tell you the rest after I've used your antidote to save my father. You're a smart lady. Don't pull any tricks on me! Listen to me, Chan, and promise not to go after us. I will not recite the rest until we are safe. Tell me the first half now! - The antidote. - Talk! All right... but I don't want other people to hear the content. - Come here and I'll whisper it to you. - All right. Come on. The first chapter... A poisoned needle! Kill me. My father is already dead. There's no point in living anymore. Chin Chen is dead. But where is the Classic? I won't let you die that easily. I must have the White Lotus Classic! You've already learned the Classic. If you can break the white fabric on your body, you'll be able to defeat Chan. White Lotus power is invincible! White Lotus power is invincible! White Lotus power is invincible! White Lotus power is invincible! White Lotus power is invincible! The Chief is valiant and invincible! The Chief is valiant and invincible! The Chief is valiant and invincible! The Chief is valiant and invincible! The Chief is valiant and invincible! The Chief is valiant and invincible! The Chief is valiant and invincible! I have gained the Empress Dowager's great favor. Thanks to the cult's saint maiden. She was incarnated and named Tieh to save the public. After hearing the people's distress, she will retire and return to heaven. She will report the distress to the Jade Emperor and come to Earth again through myself. I now declare the commencement of the sacrifice ceremony. Burn Tieh and deliver her up to heaven! Burn Tieh and deliver her up to heaven! Big Brother, help me! Insolence! The Chief is valiant and invincible! The Chief is valiant and invincible! Liang Kun, hand over the Classic. It's not gonna happen! You want to save her? You will die first! Hand over the Classic. Or your fates will be the same. Tieh! Tieh is all right. Wait! Here's the White Lotus Classic! Hong! Are you all right? - Big Brother! - Master!
