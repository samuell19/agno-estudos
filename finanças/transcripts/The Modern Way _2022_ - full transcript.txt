People who could help me out? Yeah, I know people, Frankie, just not people who are gonna hand over that sort of money. So... Looking forward to Brighton on the weekend? Mm-hmm. Good It should take your mind off of everything that's going on at home. What's it like down there? It's good, you know? Mods, scooters, music, fresh air. Can't beat it. So does this happen a lot then? The event that's on tomorrow for the mods? Yeah, but it's not just for the Mods. I mean, all sorts go down there... Bikers, Skins, Punks. It's for everyone, really. Why did you become a Mod? Mason says I shouldn't hang around with Mods. Oh, he does, does he? He says it's like football fans, like Arsenal and Spurs. They just don't mix. Well, I've got friends who are Skinheads. Yeah? Yeah. I'm looking at one right now. Millie? Well, don't look at me. I wouldn't even know where to start. Come on! The answer has got to be out there somewhere! So, why'd you become a Skinhead then? I don't know. When I met Mason and the others, they were already Skins. Since my mum changed, I felt like I didn't belong there anymore. So I felt like I needed to become one of them. A new start, to feel like I was a part of a family again. And do you? I guess. I mean, they take care of me, they look after me. Look... don't confuse care with control, Danni, alright? I mean, people can pretend to care about you, pretend to be your friend, but all they are really doing is using you for their own needs. I mean you're young, so... you might not understand it, but... one day you will. Fucking hell. What? Now if there is anyone that can help you out, Frankie, it's that man there. Who? At the bar! That's Terry Harrison. My brother's boss at Steve's Wheels. Marvin? Down the Truck Warehouse? Yeah. Now he's got money. I'm thinking... he might be able to help you out. Why? Because he's a good friend of my brother's. And he's a business man. He loans out money all the time. Yeah, but what's Frankie gonna give him in return? I don't know. He's a good friend of my brother's. It might be a favor. Well, how tight are they? I mean, is this realistic? Or is he gonna laugh in my face? It's worth a shot. And he's a Mod! So? So, so are we.

I'm in the truck business. Cleaning the wheels, renting trucks out to clients, that sort of thing. Does it pay well? It pays the bills. Do you know why I got into the business of moving weight, Terry? No. Boredom. I see people, especially the British youth, they get bored so very easily. They work all week long, they get paid at the end of the week what do they spend their money on? Booze and drugs. That is what 80% of the British youth spend their money on. Booze and drugs.

[ Chuckles ] Leon, how's the classes going, mate? Classes? Oh, right, yeah, um... They're going good, mate, really good. What classes are they, then? Well, that night at Harvey's, on the dance floor, I felt something. Probably the amphetamines and adrenaline running through your veins? No, something much, much deeper. Something woke up inside of me, like a calling. It was a rush I've never felt before. Changed me as a man, so now I'm taking dance classes. Dance classes? Yep. And not just any dance classes. I'm learning the tango. The tango? Yeah. Best in the class I am, a natural. Got my eye on this little foreign sort. Latina she is, absolute beauty. Me and her, when we dance together, it's like a fire that can never put out. Like a volcano about to erupt. Pure passion. She's special, mate. Well, good luck with her, mate. Thank you. Listen, I'm off. Behave now, you two, won't ya? And Frankie, keep that door locked in future. Yeah, I will do. Thanks, mate. See you later. [ Engine starts ] Bye, Leon. Bye, Leon. It's just me and you. Me and you. Should we go in and get another? Yeah, why not? Alright, Terry? Yeah, you, birthday girl? Happy birthday. Thanks. Your hair looks nice. Suits you. Thanks. Do you want to come inside? Mum's just cooking breakfast. Oh, yeah? How's she doing? Yeah, good. Rehab's really helped her. She's back to her old self again now that... Simon's out the picture. Well, good. I'm glad to hear it. Danni, breakfast is ready! Are you coming inside? Nah, I think I'll let you and your mum enjoy your birthday breakfast. I just wanted to pop by and wish you a happy birthday, that was all. And also... [ Car door closes ] I just wanted to, uh... give you this as well. For me? Oh, wow. Thanks, Terry! It's alright. Now you can learn to start playing now, can't you? Yeah. Are you sure you don't want to come inside? Mum would like to see you. Hey, Terry. Well... Maybe I could use a cup of tea, then. Come on.
