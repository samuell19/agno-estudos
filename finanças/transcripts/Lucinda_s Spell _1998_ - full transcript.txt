Do you never think about anything else? - [Betsy] You just said they cut off his member. - Dismember. Torn limb from limb. Ouch, she is so dumb. - You see Beatrice, we have to have rules. Before you know it, it will be a spit of penis stuff and we'll have a massive witch hunt on our ass. - Nobody is going to chop off some poor schmuck's wonker and grind it into spell powder. - That's right because it'll be against the rules. First rule, no male extremities. Write it down, Betsy. - Next you'll be inviting animal activists in to make sure we don't use any bat wings or sheep pies. - Don't be ridiculous. Rule number two. No fraternizing with the First Horn before the contest. - What are we trying to do eliminate shitting? - What if he's the one that wants to start the fraternizing? - You don't have to worry about that. Believe me. - Third and final rule. There will be no spells cast from this day forward until it's time for the contest. We can't have anyone jinxing anyone else's chances or hexing up the airwaves. - That's a ridiculous rule. No one is gonna keep me from using my magic. - Anyone caught cheating will be disqualified from the contest and suspended from the coven for a year including you Beatrice. You got all that, Betsy? - Scribed in blood. - Ha, that is a laugh. I would like to see any one of you try to keep me away from the coven. (box thudding) Oh yuck. It's the whore. (eerie music) - Whore to you too, Beatrice. - What are you crawling around for? Looking for a spell to cure your V.D.? - I think we all know who's carrying the fungi around here. Do you all have your gloves on? Look, you know why I've come. What is he doing here? - What's it to you? Spread your legs? Membership to this coven is not open to whores. - You're being mean to me. Look you fat inflamed vaginal wart, I don't care about your stupid puberty club. I just want to know what he's doing here. - Well actually Lucinda, if it hasn't escaped your attention it is the eve of Beltane, the sacred night of love, and the First Horn has to choose a mate for the celebration. - Choose a mate? How, who? - Whoever can cast the most powerful spell. Me of course. Fangs up. - Don't count your wrinkles, Beatrice. There's more to fancy spell casting than dollin' for foundation and mascara. - Shut up you fat slut. He'd never fuck you for solstice. - You cheesy, smelly cunt. - More repugnant than gorgonzola. What a whiff? Lucinda, nice of you to stop by, and ah, give my regards to your pimp. - Eh? Eh? Hey Beatrice, wonk. And wonk. Hey, how's your cheese factor? Cheesy, baby. - You virus stricken whore. - You're scaring me. Oh God, you guys are scaring me. (eerie music) You know what? I think I'm gonna go to the friend's store and get some new friends. And a whore to you, too. (eerie music) - Lucinda Bale. I know her little secret. I will fix her now. Vision light. Vision bright. - You can't do that. You can't cast a spell on another witch. - She's not a witch. She is a whore. One little spell is not going to hurt. Go on, Beatrice, fry the bitch. - Vision light. Vision bright. Foul up the First Horn's sight. Lay his eyes upon Lucinda Bale and all he'll see is a scabby veil. - Hm. A spell contest. (singing in foreign language) - Artos. Spirit guide, it's about fucking time. Come on, Artos. I'm not in the mood for this crap. - So Jason, it's nearly the eve of the Beltane. You must be fairly excited to have sex without a condom. - Cut the shite. Do you not get laid in the spirit world? - Beyond your wildest dreams, sonny boy. So what's the problem, women, again? - Just one woman. That bitch Beatrice. You know she's gonna win the bloody spell contest. - [Artos] But didn't you say she gives good head? - That's not a good enough reason to have a child with a woman. I'm trying to be serious about all this and she's a fucking nightmare. - A horny fucking nightmare. A First Horn nightmare. It's your duty to father, nurture and train a son to carry on the legacy of your ancestor Merlin or it will be lost forever. - I don't want the shite responsibility on my head anymore. It's driving me fucking nuts. - Too many undesirables know about your enchanted bloodline. You need some earthly protection. Try this. Jesse James did. - You must be out of your mind. You know every time I'm violent I lose power. This should not be the way of the druids. - Promiscuity also cost you power druid. If you spend less time screwing and more time on the magic, you wouldn't need a gun. - I'll take love and whatever shape or form it comes in. What I do not need is you encouraging me to be violent. - The preservation of knowledge and culture are two things worth fighting for. Listen to the voice of your own conscience. - Artos. Wait. What do I do about Beatrice? - [Artos] Necessity is the mother of invention. - Did the First Horn check in today? - Got a name? - Lucinda Bale. - No, his name. - His mother doesn't even know his real name. - Look, are you soliciting?

Speak quickly before you faint. - I need to know, do I have a son? - [Merlin] Indeed you do and not by a priest who was chosen on the eve of Beltane. - But does he have our blood, Merlin? - [Merlin] I myself was born of a union between a Goddess and a demon. Now, in your son's case, who is the God and who is the demon? - That's not a fucking answer. It's a riddle. If you want me to play your archaic games, then at least you can play it straight with me and give me a vision. - [Merlin] You can see the queen's ass if you so desire, but you're an idiot if you want to step inside the future. The future is a realm of possibilities. Weakened power as you are, all you'll find are your fears. - I'm not your fucker Arthur. I'm not your boy king. I'm your flesh and blood.

Where do you want to do it? - Do what? - I never did it with a real witch before, you know. - Oh no. Here's where my integrity fails me. - If you want the address, you have to do the nasty. - [Jason] That's not part of the deal, you know. - Are you scared you're gonna catch something? - Who me?

We grew up in the brothel together. When we were little, we used to have fun dreaming up far out names. Her favorite name was Necessity. Mine was Luxury 'cause I could use a little. - So what happened to her then, eh? - Got knocked up like me. Ran away. So anything you think she could do that I couldn't? - Well I do need to know where she is. - I don't know. (baby crying) - Well do you know what her real name is? - She was born and raised in a den. I don't think she had no real name. Can you pass me the Desitin over there? (baby crying) - Is there anything I can do to help? So what about the woman that runs the den with her? What's her name? - Georgina Bale, why? - I don't know. Bale. Just a thought. (baby crying) Here, darling. (bright music) - Of course they don't pay me as much as they pay the men at the institute, but they're not gonna get away with that for much longer. (bright music) - You talking to me? Listen, Melanie. I appreciate you bringing me that mermaid purse. I know it was expensive. - It was no problem. We get them free at the Marine Biology lab. I didn't have to pay for it. (bright music) - Now I know you been working hard, not getting out, getting much play, huh? - Especially surrounded by all those chauvinistic pigs. (bright music) - Oh boy. What do to me? I'll do to you. Oh yeah. Oh yeah (laughs). Oh, oh. Oh yeah. (gentle music) - When my mother comes looking for me, you tell her where I am. - Oh, get that idea out of your head. Hey, hey, smile. (bright music) (ominous music) - May I help you? (ominous music) - [Lucinda] Any ailment, any time. For the right price, I'll make you mine. Leave a message. - Lucinda, we met at the gas station in Greenview. I saw your son today. They was taking him from the orphanage. I just thought you need to know. If I could be of any help, let me know. Goodbye. - Under no circumstances at all can I tell you who adopted that boy. And I don't care if you think you are the father, especially considering the occupation of the mother. - And can you not call these adopted parents for me and explain the situation? - Absolutely not. That's illegal. They have total autonomy and anyway, I don't know how to contact them. - And what about the boy's real mother? Lucinda Bale. Do you know where I can find her, perhaps? - Probably in the same place you met her the first time. The Red Light District. - Up your bum.

Listen, we'll just pluck it off and he won't feel anything. - I can get you a peacock feather. I don't have any dodos. - What? What? What are you talking about? You have tigers and lions and gorillas and giraffes and elephants and you don't have a dodo? What kind of shit is this? What kind of crap are you running here? - They've been extinct for 100-- - Extinct? Oh my God. What? (elephant trumpeting) - [Ursula] I told you to check all of the ingredients before you did the spell. - I did. I didn't know that dodos were extinct. Do I know about dodos? Do I know anything about dodos? - Well for heaven's sake, you can choose another spell. - I can't. Tomorrow's the contest. Don't you know I did everything I could to pull this off and I don't have it at all. - Lucinda. Lucinda. If it's the First Horn you're interested in, then why don't you go directly to him? - Oh, oh and just walk up right up to him and go excuse me sir, I'm that prostitute that you saw and you know we were like hmm and then we were like hmm and now we have a son. Hey how do you like that? - Lucinda, I didn't realize that he's the father of your child. Well then you can go to him directly and ask him. - Ursula, you don't get it, do you? This is my last chance to get my son. What if he takes custody of my son? What if he takes him? What if he tries to take him away from me? - Lucinda. - No, no, no. - Lucinda, Lucinda. - If I win this contest, he'll respect me and I can have my son. We'll go and we'll adopt my son, Severin. And am I gonna win this contest? Am I gonna win this contest? Is he gonna respect me? - Yes, he respects you. - Do you respect me? - I respect you, Lucinda. I respect you. - Now listen to me you little brat, if you start screaming, I won't feed you and you'll stay here until you rot. Do you understand? Do you? Now, if you're a good boy, I'll bring your father here to collect you tomorrow night. - What about my mom? - [Beatrice] You can forget about her. She's dead. (ominous music) (speaking in foreign language) (ominous music) (upbeat music) - [Gideon] Check messages. Check messages. - Shut up you little twitch. (upbeat music) (patrons chattering) (soft music) - Fucking little shit. That hurts. (soft music) Give me that shit. Give me that shit. Shit. Lucky I don't torch your little ass. (soft music) (speaking in foreign language) (soft music) - Give me some. Oh yes. No kiss me. Kiss me. Go on, steal a kiss. Oh no. - Ew. Ew. Oh Ursula, I'm wasting my time. He's not gonna help me. - You're going to have to talk to him. That's that. - Ew. - Why do we have to wait until tomorrow? We're all here. You can spend 15 minutes with each of us and then make your decision. - Quite right. Beatrice may well be the best looking witch in the land, but I doubt she's the best fuck. - You're all forgetting something. It's not a gang-bang that we're having tomorrow. It is a contest to find the most powerful witch to participate in the Coupling for the Beltane ceremony. - Nobody's quite forgotten that, Natalie. And that is why everyone is scared shitless. - Did you really think you're gonna be the one to cast the most powerful spell, Beatrice? I mean, how much time do you actually spend practicing magic? The only practice you get is pouting in the mirror. - Is that so, Gloria? Then why is it that not one of you will look me in the eye? - Because you're phallus Medusa and everybody knows it. (Group laughing) Come on, tell the first time how many spells it takes to keep that face-lift of yours in place. - Jason knows firsthand that I haven't had any face-lifts or any other type of lips for that matter. Isn't that right, Jason? - You're all a disgrace to your sex. How can you sit there and let them pander to you like this? Do none of you have any self respect? We're just as important in all of this as he is. - No, you're quite right, Natalie. I agree. Right. The First Horn won't stand for anymore of it. So you'll just have to contain yourselves until tomorrow. And on that note, goodnight. - Meow. - And don't wait up for me. - Ah. - What is it? - He's wearing the dodo feather. (bright music) I'll have the usual, Neal. - I'll have a lemon drop. You've got to have some confidence. You need to go and speak with him, dear. You need to go and speak with him, please. - What am I gonna say? - Darling, darkness and light and the moon shining bright. I miss a man. May I join you? Go on. Go and talk to him. (bright music) - Do you mind if I sit here? - Suit yourself. (bright music) - It's an early bird day. It's one hour, special deal. (bright music) Do you want to fuck me? - Get lost why don't you. (bright music) - Do you have a match? - There's a bartender over there. Why don't you go and ask him? - Do you have a match? So, are you waiting for someone here? - Excuse me, another beer and a shot. - [Waitress] Do you want something? - I'll have what he's having. So am I bothering you? - I'm just sitting here trying to have a quiet drink. (bright music) - Oh wow, look at her. Does she turn you on? - No, does she turn you on? - No, not that one. She. I don't want cellulite. I want a girl that's, you know, she's beautiful. She has to be more beautiful that me, right? - Right. - And look her tits are fake. - And how can you tell? - 'Cause it's like real breasts are like. You know they're up and they're squishy. And the nipples are always hard when they're fake. That's how I know. - I'll remember that next time. (bright music) - Ew, I hate that. Pig. Hate when guys do that. No respect for women at all. They don't know how to make a girl feel good. - What kind of a man makes a girl feel good? - The gentle ones. They have compassion. They have a backbone, not floppy fish, you know? They have a secret. That's what it is. - Secret. - That's pretty. What is it? - It's a dodo feather. - Did you know they're extinct? - Ah, it's a family heirloom. - Do you have a family? Are you married? - No. - Children? - No. - Good. - And what's good about that? - Well, I mean no, I didn't mean that. I mean. Do you want a blowjob? I can just slip under the table. - Get lost, will you? - What's wrong? Don't you find me attractive? - Was that a trick question? - Usually guys are all over me. - Well I can understand that. I mean you do have a certain blunt charm but. - But. But what, what is it? - Well. I mean you must've been very beautiful before your accident. - What? My accident? - What was it, a car wreck? Did you go through the windshield? - What the hell? Are you crazy? What accident? - I'm sorry. I haven't stopped drinking since I got to New Orleans. - What's wrong with you? You too proud, too clean to be fucking a whore? - Actually I'm famed throughout the land for going down on whores. - Oh bullshit. I know what kind of guy you are. You're the kind of guy thinks we should be all locked up, huh? We got diseases and disorders. Definitely unfit to be mothers so fuck you. - You know I think you're going through a bit of an identity crisis. You'd be doing better business over there. - Believe me, I'm selective about who I fuck. - You know what? So am I. (bright music) - Mister listen, listen. I've got to tell you something. I've got to tell you something. - What is it, eh? Come on, what is it? - I. - You in trouble? Do you need help? Do you need money? You want money? I'll give you money. Just leave me alone. - I don't want your money. - What do you want? - I want your dodo feather. - You want my feather? - Mm hm. Listen I'll make you a deal, okay? I'll do anything. I'll do anything you want. Just give me that dodo feather please. - Oh God, you're out of your mind. - Please, please, please, come on. - No. - Come on. - Oy, stop it. Stop it. Take the feather. And get out of here. Jesus. Women. (upbeat music) (singing in foreign language) (upbeat music) - Car wreck?

I'ma come in there and lay you across your kitchen sink, baby. I'll see you tonight. (machine beeping) - [Attendant] Lucinda. We met at the gas station in Greenview. I saw your son today. They was taking him from the orphanage. (dramatic music) (glass shattering) - No. I gave away my son. I'll never get him back. Give me my son. - You can't come bursting into my office. You have no rights here. - Where is he? - You should be thinking of his best interest. He was very lucky to be adopted. There are better children that have been here for years. - I want to know where my son is. - I have a restraining order. I'm calling the police. - Police? Why don't you call the FBI or the national guard, you fuck? Now you give me my son. - Don't you threaten me, you filthy woman. - Where's the file? - [Orphanage Woman] There is no file. The state doesn't release any information to me. - You crook. You criminal. Give me their names. - You are not privileged to have that information. - Who adopted him? Who adopted him? Do you want me to say it again? - [Orphanage Woman] I want this filthy whore out of here. - Severin. Severin. Let me go. Can't you give me my son? Please? Get him to be with his mother. - Get this whore out of here. - I can do this. Please. I need your help. (soft music) (singing in foreign language) (crowd cheering) - Tonight, as the eve of Beltane, long ago bonfires raged across the pagan land. People abandoned their burdens to celebrate new life. Children were conceived out of wedlock. And the Gods were invoked to protect the seasons crops. To mark this day, I would be honored to join the winner of the spell contest for the coupling. (soft music) Let the celebration begin. (crowd cheering) (soft music) - My how attractive you are, Maddison. Too bad I'm not a lesbian. - When do I get the kid? - After I win the contest. - Why wait? - Because if the spell you gave me doesn't work, he's mine. - Hail the First Horn. He of shadows, he of night, I drink your piss, your vile, your fright. From Adial Grave to Algol Star, come out, come out, wherever you are. - [Demon Spawn] What you want you blue haired twat? - To demonstrate my power over your domain. Tell those who gather here who you are. - [Demon Spawn] What right do you have to command me to give you my secret name? - Don't question my power. Reveal yourself. - [Demon Spawn] Make me you pathetic, wretched, fag hag. - Reveal your name demon spawn, I command you. - [Ezekial] Time out. Stop it. You win. Ezekial, miserable 14th son, 14th son, 14th son of Satan. I bow at your command forever and forever. Now please, stop squeezing my balls. (crowd laughing) - Go home Demon Spawn. - [Ezekial] Fuck you too. - Does any among you feel they can better Betsy's power? Eh? (soft music) (crowd cheering) (soft music) Does any among you feel you can better Natalie's power? - [Crowd] Beatrice. Beatrice. Beatrice. Beatrice. - Hail the First Horn. I'll show you what real power is. I consecrate this magic circle with ancient elements of earth, water, fire and air. Let all evil spirits come forth. Let all good be gone. (crowd screaming) Witch power, witch power, burn with fire. Influence these demons to bring me desire. Crimson passion, crimson passion burn with fire. Bewitch this sator for my hire. (soft music) - [Virility] Here's what you want. Good girl. - Watch as I devour Virility himself. (soft music) - Nice, kitty. Good girl. Oh yeah. (soft music) (crowd cheering) - I am the best. Never doubt me. I am the best. - The best of the worst. I challenge her. - Who let this clap trap in here? Get her out. She's not a member of this coven. - Relax, Beatrice. Maybe it's time that I join. - She's not a witch, she's a whore. She'll ruin the good name of this coven. - I'm a sex witch. And you, you're a fraud. I know all about you and you know nothing about what I do. - I know that you're a filthy whore. - What are you afraid of, Beatrice? That my magic is more powerful than yours? - You wish, whore. Whore. Whore. Whore. - [Crowd] Whore. Whore. Whore. Whore. Whore. Whore. Whore. - Silence. Silence. Silence. I want to see her magic. - Why? - Oh shut up, Beatrice. Give the wee lassie a chance. - Whore. (soft music) (singing in foreign language) - Without me, you'll never scratch the surface of the power he holds. - Come on out, boy. Your father's here. Don't you want to meet your daddy? - He's not my daddy. - Come on, son. Everything's gon' be all right. - You're not my father. I know what he looks like. He came to me in a dream. - I'll be more than a father to you. I'll be your friend. - I don't think so. (speaking in foreign language) (soft music) - Come on, grab the kid. (singing in foreign language) (upbeat music) - All who will have their own truth revealed to them, look into the light. Lucinda, look into my light and see. Abandon your doubts and feels for I am conjured from the purity of your heart. I am the light within you. You have lived the life of the wholly hollered. You are descendant of Ishtar, great lover of Babylon. You are a Priestess, a Sorceress, a Prophet and Healer. Sister of Aphrodite and Mary Magdalene. You have been set apart to be the bride of man and to give birth to the son of Merlin. Scarlet woman, you are the sacred whore, glorious daughter of Venus. (crowd cheering) (soft music) - Severin. Oh God. Magic beads for you. (soft music) Hey. - Stay back, bitch. Here's the deal. I take the boy and you can have both those bitches. I'm sure you can figure out a way to have more kids, oh great horny one. - You beg my wrath, Maddison. - What? Your wrath (laughs)? I can kill them both and you wouldn't lift a finger to stop me. - Do something. - Lady, he's a lover not a fighter. - Use your magic. - He can't use his magic to kill. Isn't that right, Merlin? True Blood. - I've warned you. - Forget it. - You reckon just 'cause I think killing people's a mistake that I wouldn't lift a finger to save my own son? - Yeah, you're still a free range chicken shit. - So you want my blood? You need to turn your lead into gold, right? That's why you're here. But do you understand it also means I have the power to transmute? - So? - So, did you ever hear the riddle of the shape shifter? - So what of it? - The theory has something to do with the one love idea. God and the universe being the same. God is love, love is everywhere. Everything's interconnected. We're all one. You're me, I'm you. Know what I mean, eh? Do I have to spell it out for you, sister? - Sister, huh? Don't preach that holy shit to me. - To put it in layman's terms, I believe love is magic. (speaking in foreign language) (ominous music) - Bitch. (gun firing) (ominous music) (thunder rumbling) - Necessity. Necessity. Necessity. (sirens wailing) Necessity. Lucinda. Lucinda. Why'd you not tell me about my son? - Your son? - What's that for? - That's for getting me pregnant. - Well I suppose you have every right to hate me. Now what's that for? - That's for getting me pregnant. - Wait, wait. I need to see you again. I need to have a relationship with our son. - Oh that's right, you're the father. Well you can always call me. 669-6969. Make an appointment. (soft music) - An appointment? (soft music) Aye.
