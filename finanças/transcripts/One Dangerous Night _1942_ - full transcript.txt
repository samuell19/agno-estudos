Among those presents at mrs Brownell's delightful garden party were miss Dottie Duckandfield and that respected pillar of society, mr Michael Lanyard alias the Lone wolf retired. Once the world's most notorious and distinguished jewel thief. Whilst his man Jamison spent an electable evening entertaining the local boy scouts outing with practical jokes conjuring tricks fireworks... - fireworks? So that's what you have in that package. Don't you know that's illegal Jamison? Oh, yes sir but do we have to be pillars every day of the week sir, sundays and holidays included ouldn't we just treat ourselves to a small crime or two on my days off sir couldn't we search us for old anxiety, sir, couldn't we? I haven't forgotten my old days James. No, haven't you sir, haven't you really? -Oh no, indeed. Oh, look sir a lovely sight, a very lovely sight Can we help you? Way, yes. Do you mind giving me a lift? I'm just going a short way down the road. Not at all. What about your car? - oh I don't know, I'll phone from the house where I'm going have the garage man do something about it. I'm in an awful hurry. Please can't we go a little faster. Oh, but sir we're doing 30 now. Having trouble, Arthur? No mr Cooper. The bag was a little full and I had to repack it. Can't seem to get this in the lock. There we are, sir. Arthur. Now, um... what are your orders? I'm to take the luggage to the airport, sir, and have it put aboard the plane. That's right. Then what? on the way back to town sir I'm to telephone you at about 10 o'clock and let you know if that certain party is left for the plane. - that's right Arthur. Is that all, sir? - Good night Arthur. Good answer. Thanks very much. Goodbye. - Not at all, goodbye. Coming Jamison? - Yes, sir. oh, yes, sir. Oh it's you, Arthur. - Yes, miss Anderson. Where's mr Cooper? I don't think he's quite dressed. When he plays down that waiting Arthur, and I must be... Wel, it's about time you got here. Kids got a bad case of ants always in the stew. Take it easy Mike. The bracelet's there now waiting for Cooper in his drawing room. Well, what a racket. I wish I knew this guy's angle. I'll tell you so you know what you're up against. Cooper was the doe back of your pal Davey Simpson's fancy gambling joints. He was the devil Nicholas Simpson down a long time ago. Sure, but a lot of prominent citizens Cooper's society playmates had big ious outstanding with Davey, which I owe us an hour mr Cooper's hands. Cooper's got him good and he knows it, so when he turns on the heat they come across. That dirty blackmailer. Davey takes the wrap and he's still operating. When I get my hands on the wrap... - All right Mike take it easy. If the stuff's not on Cooper it'll be in the wall safe. Here's the combination. - Okay, Arty. If sunnyboy here can just keep his shirt on long enough we'll do all right. Keep out of sight. And make sure you wait till Cooper's alone. Jamison what's happened, out with it man. Just look, sir. The star sapper excellent qualities are surrounded by diamonds. A fine halter and a neat job well done if I do say, sir. You idiot. you petty bird brain. Did you dare... - I did indeed, sir, the young lady never even missed it. Jamison you're fired - No, but you can't stop progress sir, this is the birth of a new era and fate, dame fate has us by the hand. Well, tell her to hang on. because I have you by the other hand Jamison, and I'm leading you right back to return this handbag. before we have all the police New york after us.

truth about Cooper from her I'll move on to the others that's a good idea you and Jamison wait for me in the lobby of the park avenue hotel oh here to Jamison you keep this just in case mr Shannon gets restless and tries to communicate with the police sorry Sydney but from now on we're not playing games I'm sorry Arthur miss Andrews isn't here why did you want to see her oh i guess she and mrs bodine have gone to see miss Jane Merrick at the royal theater they're all friends of mr Coopers and I've got a hunch they have things to talk about why what makes you think that I'm sorry old man for us all right who's your friend Harry Cooper's ballot why why should Harry Cooper's fella think that miss Andrews and mrs bodine went to the royal theater to see uh Jane minnick why not they're all friends no doubt they had things to discuss Harry Cooper's murder for instance say what's all this to you who do you think you are cross-examining me like this just a man who wants to find out who murdered Harry Cooper after all i should think you'd be a little interested yourself mr Sheldon I think your fiance is mixed up in a very serious business if i were you i wouldn't think that mr Norton not out loud you better be sure I will be before the evening's over and just in case you get a little worried about her yourself you know where she is thank you please you keep Shannon here if Eve Andrews doesn't return in 15 minutes follow me to the royal theater I'm going to call on miss Jane Merrick backstage hey Mike Mike say what is this Lanyard promised me I'd be in on Everything that goes on I'm going down to the royal theater too oh sexy not just yet sir if you don't mind we'll wait here for a few minutes what is it what are you doing here somebody saw us earlier tonight you mean his house yes come on Arthur I'm here on business girl so let's skip the formalities what do you want well let's just say that I'm here to continue negotiations where poor mr Cooper left off the boss was getting a diamond bracelet from you wasn't he miss Andrews and I'll take that diamond ring from you mrs bodine and that clip that you were going to give mr Cooper miss Merrick make us happy girls I have no time to argue so just come across please suppose the police were to find out where you girls were this evening drop that gun out there what do you mean by frightening these three beautiful ladies mustn't touch Mike well inspector you're ahead of schedule I didn't expect you to catch up for quite a while all right outside Everybody line them up against the back wall diggins I'm going to find out who's who and what's what come on outside outside Everybody come on just a minute oh it's okay I'm cindy Shannon oh hello inspector what goes on oh hello Sydney better get your pencil ready by the way inspector have you met Arthur mr Cooper's valet face is familiar those were probably his pals you and Dickens were chasing at Cooper's house did you catch up with them yes good they planned to rob Cooper tonight and that isn't all Arthur was attempting to blackmail these three ladies when i interrupted him a few minutes ago wasn't he ladies yes oh good evening dr bodine oh Sydney i promised you some sensational dirt and here it comes sorry inspector but I can't get away just yet good evening gentlemen I've been expecting you inspector the case against me looks pretty bad doesn't it obviously it would be bad for anyone who was at Coopers tonight even though Cooper was dead when I got there but did you know that these three ladies were there when Cooper was killed it's a lie Sonia Sonia i refuse to be questioned like this Sonia denied why should i Eve I know you couldn't have had anything to do with a murder but you can't stop now you must tell us what you were doing at Cooper's house Johnny Cooper was trying to blackmail me blackmail you how why didn't you tell me about it i should have I know that now but he threatened to go to your father and I know if he did we never could have been married I was terrified i hated him Johnny but i didn't kill him i swear I didn't sony and Jane were afraid of Cooper too they had as much reason to hate him as i did don't drag me into this i had nothing to do with it no me don't try to blame me I don't know who killed Cooper but when the lights went out we heard the shot my little match and you were near Cooper's body you could have done it stop her Sonia don't let her say anything like that why not it might as well come out now I was there i went to bribe Cooper to keep his mouth shut to protect you from a scandal that's a laugh isn't it but just before koofa was killed tonight i made up my mind to stop pretending that i care anymore about you than you do about me I was about to tell him to go ahead and make a scandal he was getting no more jewels for me to protect you put that in your call mr Shannon and see how he likes it so you don't know what you're saying oh yes I do gentlemen I didn't kill Harry Cooper for the simple reason that my husband means absolutely nothing to me you're sure you didn't kill him Jane my husband means quite a lot to you doesn't he that's enough Sonia leave Jane out of this of course Jane isn't the type she couldn't have done it could she Jane tell them you shouldn't do it Eric you're being ridiculous after all I have my career to worry about our little romance isn't that important to me don't flatter yourself i wouldn't commit murder for you or any man on earth I've got to hand it to you Mike the dirt is certainly pouring out now all right we're not interested in your gossip column Shannon gentlemen gentlemen please you're breaking the spell let's let the murderer convict himself or herself come come ladies and gentlemen don't stop now you were doing beautifully why did you interrupt them is that all you had to say miss mary dr boudin you had more than sufficient reason to hate Harry Cooper haven't you anything to say ladies and gentlemen one of you killed Harry Cooper well my guy inspector this strain is beginning to tell give the murderer a chance to do the talking strain yourselves gentlemen please not now Jamison not now but I've come to the rescue sir Jamison you have the most amazing knack of doing the right thing at the wrong him somebody time it inspector I'm afraid Jamison and i must be leaving it's unfortunate that we were interrupted just when the murderer was about to give himself away you think i killed Harry Cooper but you're wrong inspector the guilty person is within your reach and the proof is not far away so stay close to your phone inspector I'll call you up very soon and lay that proof right on the line where'd you get that thing Jamison it's just a fake sir I got it out of the prop truck it's loaded with blanks oh well here let's jam the trigger and leave it on the floor to speak for itself did you see land user Jamison no sir the other guy got away too get back headquarters and wait for land to tell the phone calls right sheep well we got away again sir I'm afraid cheer up Jamison if my hunch doesn't come through we won't get away oh come now sir we always win out in the end don't we don't we well don't we i expect we'll have company you wait here and if you see anybody you recognize male or female let me know well whom do you expect sir oh good evening good evening how's the patient just fine i hope that wound isn't too painful let's see the unfortunate interruption occurred just when you were going to tell me about Harry Cooper listen I don't know who you are but the last time we talked about mr Cooper you know what happened you loved Harry Cooper didn't you will you please go away you loved him didn't you why was he killed you're implicated too you know so you'd better tell me all right i loved him isn't that enough for me to say now will you please go away you loved him and that's why he was killed thanks Patricia that is all you have to say I didn't say that mr Lanyard someone's coming down the corridor sir i won't close the door not all the way here let's leave it like that hello now tell inspector Crane at police headquarters that Michael Lanyard is here in sweep 3a well keep that aside Jamison remember you're here just in case oh hello Mike oh it's you Sydney I'm glad you came huh by the way how did you know where to find me oh that was simple i knew you'd come back here but I'm afraid it's not going to be quite so simple for inspector Crane to figure out oh well if it's the inspector you're going to call I've already saved you the trouble Sydney he's on his way well that's fine yes I believe you know Patricia don't you Sydney just gave me some interesting gossip for your column she told me that she was in love with Harry Cooper give that to me James so Mike you were going to prove I was wrong huh and i find your man with his gun and Shannon's back copping Dickens with pleasure and frisk him i did your partner good job do me a favor Crane and call out the army or whatEver it takes to get these two downtown once and for all now none of your tricks this time Mike come on we're going for a ride I've got some very interesting information for you inspector very interesting nothing doing all right you win over the way have you met this lady here this card will introduce her mrs Patricia blake Shannon how'd he do mr Shannon asked mr Shannon what his wife was doing at the airport tonight that's ridiculous don't listen to him the murderer was afraid I'd find out that she and Cooper were planning to run away together he got panicky and took a shot at her then he tried to get me I told you not to listen to him take him downtown Crain he's getting delirious oh wait a minute wait a minute both of you there's the man who killed Cooper that's very interesting Mike but i happen to know that some valuable jewelry has been missing since that murder that was the motive for this crime you find me the man with those jewels and I'll have the murderer the jewels had nothing to do with it very nice story for the tabloids Mike but it won't hold in a court at all come on now we're going downtown oh all right Crain but if you really think the jewels had anything to do with the crime do me one last favor search Shannon all right you won't mind mr Shannon just humor our smart friend here not at all go ahead dig it go ahead the jewels but it'd be a lesson to you Jamison yes sir what I don't understand is how you knew he had them well i knew the Dickens was about to search you besides your hands are slower than they used to be yes you mind if we hurry what somebody stole it i had it just a minute ago in fact if you don't mind the exercise i suggest we run a bit Jamison not again haven't we had handbag trouble enough for
