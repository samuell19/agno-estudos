A puma doesn't kill for food. It kills because it can. Well, sometimes it does. But other times it kills just for the sake of killing. Because it's frightened. Or because that's just the way it is. It sees another creature and goes for the jugular. Because that's what it was born to do. Did you kill it? Did you? Easy, little fella, easy. This would be "doesn't". Ok? This one. Which pronoun would it be for this one? "I", "we", "you" and "they". And for this one, which pronoun? "He", "she" and "it". This is the negative form. Isaías, over here. In the interrogative, the auxiliary goes first. -Until tomorrow, kids. -Until tomorrow. Peace. Don't forget to bring your english homework tomorrow. Isaías used to say that when he grew up he wanted to be a motorcycle mechanic, or a singer. Something in the city. Later, he started to talk about becoming a hunter. Since his older brothers hunted, he said he could do that too. But we always hunted birds and armadillos. Turn it on, Uri. That's it. Turn it off. I hit myself. Fuck. Now you hit me. Put your hand there. I don’t want sun on me. No, put your hand there. There? No, close it. I'm putting it there. There! Let me go and I'll put it there. There, no! Did you know the puma has cubs? My brother told me. How does your brother know? Because of the footprints. Is it very small? The footprints made it seem really small. You can identify a puma's footprints by its paws, its tracks. The paws are like a dog's. The same foot. But a dog leaves marks with its nails and a puma doesn't. A puma leaves just the paw, no claws. Listen. Look, mama. Do you remember when we used to do the up, down, slowly, slowly, up, down, slowly, slowly. Come on, mama, let's see those moves. That's "Long bell people". You scared me. You have some left. Right there. Hang on. There it is. See how it changes. Are you going to go? Yes. There's a quinceañera. Do you know whose it is? Yes. Whose is it? Mili Cafarate's. No way. That's what they told me. I'm gonna kick your ass. You're always the same. Not this time. What do you know? I know a lot. You know a lot about blood. And you know a lot about moustaches. And rats. They've been fired. Then they're useless, throw them away. We'll need to buy some more. Now we had to lock the stables, put the livestock away earlier, not go out at night, nor leave the dogs loose. "Pumas attack at night". That's what Isaías used to say. He said that he'd seen the puma. That he had shone a flashlight on it and it'd stood still, staring at him. There, Uriel, on that mound over there, the red light appears, that's the bad light. And in that tree you see over there a crying baby appears. Every night. Why are you covering your ears? At night, when we had to lock up the stables, we would race. The first one to arrive and close the gate would be the guard. The other would be the assistant. And the guard could give orders. So he would say: "Walk over to that tree with your eyes closed". Or stuff like that. Is this filming? The older ones told Isaías that he couldn't go with them. But all the same Isaías wanted to go. "We'll take Troy and a shotgun" he would say to me. But it's not that easy to hunt a puma. Because if it doesn't come down for water, you're not going to see it. And if it's a female with cubs, it's more dangerous. Maybe it kills three sheep, and eats only one. It does it so the cubs learn how to hunt. So that they learn how to kill. At first, long before we arrived from the cities, it was all swamps, pools, and absorbing plants. And before that, soft beasts, and smilodons with sharp fangs. Giant animals that slept entire days on the green grass. We used to live in Villa Mercedes. One afternoon, a truck appeared at my place. They loaded all the furniture, we loaded some things in the car and took off. I think it took us two and half or three hours to get here. We arrived at night. And when we arrived, all we could see were some scattered lights. Because we were in the middle of nowhere. There was no road, no asphalt, no stores. There was nothing. It was all open fields and all you could see were some lights. El Cacique escaped at night. He left having loaded everything on a truck. He took a table and three TV sets, an electric bike, two calves, a sheep, a statue, and 14 million pesos. He left his house empty and damaged. That's my mom and dad. They met at work, I think. I don't remember. But they met. Some days went by, she got pregnant. And I was born. That chubby kid there is me. One day my dad went out to buy some bread, but he went to see a girl, so they split up. I don't call him because of that. It was really tough seeing them break up. And it got worse when my grandparents died. Angel, time to eat. Angel. Angel was the first to be born in the community. La Machi named him "Toro Nahuel". But since his dad is El Muerto, they call him El Muertito. I know. It's under a Trinoceros. They are very small dinosaurs. Which have large families and are fighters and dangerous. This one's bigger than the Carcharodontosaurus. The Carnotaurus. Bigger than the Carcharodontosaurus. And the most famous is the Tyrannosaurus. The Tyrannosaurus is bigger than the Carnotaurus and the Carcharodontosaurus, too. In that one you can download the motorbike. -Do you know how to download it? -No. In the video you cannot see it. Isaías liked Luana. I think that's why he wanted to hunt the puma. Luana was the last one to arrive. She came one night a year ago. Her mother started working in a factory. And had to leave her here with her grandmother. We'll be in the south of San Luis celebrating the coming of spring and students' day. Kids and grown-ups only. You can't miss it! State-of-the-art sound! Quality lighting and best stage sets. Advanced tickets are already for sale. For everyone in Fortín, Ranqueles, Buena Esperanza, Nueva Galia, Arizona. This is how the fugitive from Ranquel leaves. This is how this man leaves. Here comes the truck. It's 2 am. He's leaving at night because he's ashamed of loading things up in the daytime. Pueblo Nación Ranquel. Where is this? At the entrance. He stole, he robbed. Hobo, insolent, scoundrel! A pig ate from here too. Sure, but a pig couldn't have killed it. It only ate the back, did you notice? Because there's a lot of meat. The chest has more fat. Then it leaves it. The chest has more fat. Then it leaves it. A puma must have killed it. What do you think? I dreamt I saw the puma. That it was walking and I found it behind a bush. It started staring at me, lying on the grass. I tried to get closer to touch it, but the grass turned black and started to burn. The puma cried, like a baby cries. I turned around and saw lightning nearby. But then the puma turned black, like a panther, or a wolf. And I felt like I didn't have to be there anymore. Like I had to leave. It was like the panther started chasing me. To get me out of its place. But my legs weren't working. It was like I was running in slow motion. Or swimming. And then I woke up. Write down the date. Women used to dress up mostly for special occasions. They'd wear earrings: "chawuai". Necklaces: "traipel". And always had brooches to fasten their clothing the "tapú". Are you copying this? Nazareno Cruz was cursed. Because he was the seventh son, he was doomed to become a wolf. One day the Devil told him that he would free him if he stopped liking the girl he liked. Nazareno said no and became a wolf. And he ate the sheep. But it was fine, because he was in love. Isaías used to hunt little birds. He had a yellow cardinal, a hooded siskin and a golden-billed saltator. Territorial birds. They go blind if you put another songbird in their territory. That's how he hunted them. He would record them with his phone and then use it to call the birds. And they would always come. Are you coming with us to buy ammo? With who? With us. Where will you go? To Buena Esperanza. With who? Joaco? You're not going. Of course we're going. To Batavia? No, that old fuck in Batavia won't sell to me anymore. Why? He won't sell to me. But why? I don't know. Louder! More! Louder. You want me to roar even louder? If I were a puma, I'd hide in the dunes, far away from everything. I'd look for a high place from where I could see far away. A place hard to find. A cave dogs couldn't reach. Where humans would have to get off their horses. And then I'd attack them. Number three: "Kla". Four: "Meli". Five: "Kechu". Six: "Kaiu". Seven: "Regle". Eight: "Pura". -See you tomorrow, kids. -Until tomorrow. Peace. If I were a puma I'd wait until nightfall and then seek shelter. Somewhere deserted. And there, I'd wait until the rain comes. Because the rain erases the tracks. And then I'd attack again. Isaías insisted and insisted, until the older ones said he could go with them. He said that to kill the puma he just needed one bullet. And with its fang he was going to make a necklace. Will you use this one? No. I'm staying here. They started their search near the community. Later, they searched around the lagoon. But there were no tracks. In the woods they found more fresh prints on the ground. They could see the mother's and the cub's. They saw something moving behind a tree. Pichinau raised his weapon. And almost without looking, took a shot. He hit it, but didn't kill it. Then they followed the trail of blood and the dogs led them to the desert. And there they kept searching. Salute these lands. Nowadays, nowadays, nowadays. How nice is the dance, the dance. They came to show, choyke. Right now, right now. Salute the people. Their dance is very beautiful. If you don't know how to ride. Get out of here, Uriel. So in the game you have to catch fish, and when they bite and the water runs white, you have to pull out the pole. And the fish comes up. Look. There are prints there. They're like… A puma's. There are more prints there. No, those aren't a puma's prints. They're too close to the community. It doesn't matter. They can kill us. You guys are gonna get killed. You too. No. We'll be at home, and pumas can't get inside houses. Yes, they can. Tell me how. By smashing the window. Only the little ones can go inside. They can attack us, but they can't hurt us. Yes, they can kill us. A car's coming. Uri, it's Isaías with the older ones. I don't care. They would go hunting every day. Sometimes they followed the trail of blood or thought they heard moaning. But they could never find the puma. They had to go further away every time. Until Troy got lost while following a trail. Let's go! They used to say that's how everything had started. That in the beginning, there was only water. Everything was lagoon and puddles. And in the sky were the clouds. Which looked down from above. Then came the wind. And the clouds started crashing into each other. And from the crashing came the lightning bolts. And the lightning bolts dried the water. The sand was full of dried fish. And after the prayers the storms returned. And with the storms the water revived them. And then, we were all born: dogs, humans, horses, and pumas. I'm bleeding and it hurts to walk. I have to hunt so my cub can eat, and learn. I go down to the lagoon and see a deer, alone. Drinking water and resting. When it trots towards the trees again I follow it. I walk on the grass where my blood drops. I approach slowly. When I see it again it's no longer a deer. It's an ostrich. And it stares at me. It tells me to hide. But I cannot hide. I have to hunt. Then it tells me to come closer. And that's when it shows me. A group of men coming with dogs and shotguns. The ostrich tells me not to move. That it will warn me. They come from everywhere. They talk to each other with talkies. Whispering. "It's there, behind the bush". "Don't move". My wound hurts and I move. The ostrich digs a small hole and tells me to put my head inside it. I hide my head and listen: "Where is it? I can't see it". The ostrich tells me the storm is coming. And that when it arrives no one will find me. I hear a shot. I take my head out. And the ostrich is no longer there. Listen. It's there. Listen.
