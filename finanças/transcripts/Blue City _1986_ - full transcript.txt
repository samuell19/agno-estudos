I'm not going to leave right away And Kerch could be told that I came to talk Who are you then? - Turner.

Try me. - One drink does not open the bloodstream yet Did I hear you ask Kerch? - I don't know, did you hear? You talked about your father's killer. Was it a joke? I guess it depends on whether he killed others Here you should pay attention to their speeches. - So I'm going elsewhere to talk It's cozy. Bed and all Do customers take a nap here? - I'm not laughing anymore You had to tell me who else Kerch has killed Get considerable evidence if you plan to talk like that The police never know what they believe Either you went to sing? - With the chief of police He happens to be a family friend The police don't believe a word of your speech - you don't know what I know Will you find out?

Just think! What about Kerch? - She had a small accident This month's special offer. - I don't eat birds Let's take another one. - What kind of accident? His car exploded. Nothing more serious Accidents just tend to pile up And the next may already be more serious. In that way, life is constricted Kerch should be careful - he does not happen to be in the car when it explodes Better safe than sorry. That's what Dad always said A personal call from W. Turner. Finally, Mr. Kerch I have played all days a car telephone I do not believe it! R j hti, huh?

You and me both I came here from Miami to help your father Pam. Someone went and shot him Then I fell in love with her widow and now I run a club I thought you wanted your share when you showed up here I tried to buy you cheap out of business I believed that with a little intimidation, it would work Did not work out Now we do - that I will give you 50,000 bucks You take that too and disappear here Our war will end there. You got that? You will disappear here too. I don't want to see you anymore That's when I hate you Next time you will not survive the gorilla discipline Next time you get out of your breath You just don't realize I don't want your money, I catch my father's killer I want him caught in irons and an electric chair That's how much justice needs to be found. You will be strong in this Strange hubby Did you have to send our money to that grandmaster? Reynolds doesn't have time to chase us while playing banker You should have that kind of boat too Healthy, racetrack ry . You were involved, of course What are you talking about? - Don't try! I am a police station tiss What about the other service I asked for? - No way What was that? I get embarrassed for your use I'm worried about you You don't realize. We're going to war ... - You've already lost your war Billy is just as crazy as he was in school I'm going to war against Kerch without you I'm not going to end up in that lousy boat I don't swallow anything It will take a long time before you can walk home It's good then How long do you have to take Joey on your crusade? He wants to join. Pit still concerns I too Thanks for the ride. - Please Sorry I can't be as excited as you are I'm just. You don't spin on that villain If Joey doesn’t get up now it will never happen Or are you doing this because of Joey. - I do it because it's right What should you think of? Usually I just make people angry I do it wisely when I don't think of anything Didn't Joey tell you to keep the buttons off me? - I didn't think so But that's the idea. Sometimes you can't do anything about it I had to sleep on the couch Of course you can sleep on the couch if you want You're pretty nice, too. - I won't win You didn't have to think Good morning. This is Parker from the Miami Herald Your male coroner in the murder scene - new issues have emerged that lead to prosecutions Would you have any comments? - No. Would he swallow the bait? - As a whole This low trick feels good to destroy Who called? - No one Yes, there was clearly someone there Now start again. - Who's doing this trick? I want to know who it was Hey. You will come later I got evenings so the day will be long Kerch hired me to dance for his club Why? - There, I have not known that Joey's sister I could gather information while I was there Unnecessarily dangerous. - Or is it You can surrender to death - and put my brother in there but I can't do anything By the way, this is the card information about your father's murder Mit�? - Mit� sielt� l�ytyi? Not a single clue What did you think you would find? - Something crucial No traces of fighting. Shot directly in front The shooter apparently felt like Dad. - You guessed it anyway Getting a file was a silly idea. - Was not It was a good idea because it led me to important information There was a mention of more information in the Reynolds archive After all, they relate to Kerch's presuppositions Did you bring that report with you? - I did not dare Reynolds came in just as I was at the filing cabinet But I called Miami and asked for 607 from Kerch What is a 607? It is a computer print of public documents Why didn't you tell me yesterday? You said I shouldn't play undercover We'll see. I'll let you know if I find anything interesting Hey now. I don't want to be late Hey, amitimamma. - What are you doing here? I came to pick you up for the ride. - You're not serious We could visit the cemetery to watch Dad Do you remember your male corpses? If the father's killer is not found - can be used so that you lose your big house You're crazy. Now get out of here and leave me alone You can, of course, explain what Kerch did - but it retaliates as quite a biblical grief Why are you bothering me? I've never done you any harm Katsohan t t I liotellut koipeani vedess. It seems to have helped Is everything ready? What now? Do you still want to join? - I don't think I'll cancel? This gig is from a different country. When you walk in, you will be recognized So for sure. After all, I'm an actual celebrity How are you getting along? - No complaints What are you showing? - Too good I lift a hundred Every age stand up! You too, little pig Miss Kerch? - Not here What? - He's not here Sli. Now he leaves this fun unexperienced Is the team in control? - Is. Go collect the winnings About that There he breaks up your club We came again. - Hey, puller, come here for a second Do you remember me? - This is your street Pour your palate! It's on the house! A blow to the puller’s knee changed my life A bowl for that crystal crown. - You can scab Kerch's bum In this game, only the little devils go crazy T m p yll tys! - The venetian audience, Billy We now have no idea what you are talking about After all, the powers of your district do not extend to the club or the dog track So there are no problems. - There are problems and a lot The users of the club come from the city side You ruin people’s fun and shake my ball And the benefit of this is. You won't find your father's killer like that Because the police do nothing - we are forced to put pressure on Kerch somehow Wasn't it enough that Kerch broke your knee? Where did you find this today? - He's my only friend You are still alive but not because of skill Moukan has been lucky Kerch will not fail to retaliate I would advise going on holiday You know Billy Turner. Do not pour Kerchia But he would give me the necessary evidence What inspires you to help? - Money Let Paradise Palms bring you all the savings Didn't that motel go? How far are we going? - Far enough This is no pleasure It is a luxurious place Would we even change the sheets here? - Four times a night Is there a swimming pool here? - Guaranteed Yes, they now remember us What's next? - I don't know at all I wished Kerch was there Options are low and the finals are near He or me. - I guess so You could pick up a little.

All right Now listen carefully Dehhie Torres said she knew about her father's killer She is one of those club girls Meet Falsta / under the pier Are you still crazy about me? - Still You're late, Annie I couldn't tell the boss I was going to see you I saw this. - This is definitely 607 It is a marriage certificate of Perry Kerch and Malvina Bragg They were inaugurated on October 17, 1975. There is no indication of the difference They have been married all along They cheated on my father's parka and took his money This does not yet prove Kerch to be a killer Why didn't they keep milking? - Maybe Dad found out And I'm not a good detective? - Are You are an excellent detective Dehhie is in room 11 Kuka siell ? - Annie Rayford Did you bring Billy with you? - I brought both Billy and my brother Annie said you knew something about my father's death Who else wants pizza? Min die soon nlkn Now is not the time to talk. - You just ordered pizza Stop twisting or rail the heart from your chest This is a trap How is? Let's talk You end up as dog food.

Right away for the first time I saw that the guy was full of devils Are we calling the governor now? Where are you taking him? I can't defend you You did a terrible thing. You could be charged with murder Do you know about self-defense? - I had already forgotten your legal skills You are starting to be a real bully You would deserve a long sentence, but it would arouse evil blood The mayor's son is not getting better The report states that the pimp killed that slut because of a money dispute And the police again shot the pimp when he tried to escape You were brought in for a hearing but I let go You're leaving town now. You got that? Is that all? - No. If you still see your face here, you will not survive without a prison sentence I could still make a lot of charges I have a lot of friends in prison - who know how to make the hell of your life difficult Raise the boy's wheel on his back and bring the city to the border Ent� Joey? - Mit� h�nest�? Joey could leave as well He is not a problem. Release Rayford in the morning But he also ends up in the tube if he still shows up here Or I guess it is wisest to shoot him right away Korea py�r� Didn't you have to go to Savannah? You can't get there except through Jacksonville My cousin is there in these branches called Plantation Walk past you. There is good food and atmosphere If you have the wrong number. Annoyingly dials the wrong number Thank God. You finally answered P stik Reynolds Joey released? - P sti Give him the phone. Hello? Is Joey there? - Renolds called Joey is dead. They shot him I recognized the body I'll go back there to take care of this to the end. - I know that A little pickles and then onions Why aren't the lights on? What do I pay you for?

The JW can rest in peace And soon you will rest Was this a surprise? Your father was good to me. He was promoted to police chief Ensured a comfortable stay But man always just wants more I figured out how to get everything for myself I killed your father To be honest, I killed everyone else Kerch found me quite a nice man I was just waiting for the right opportunity I let them tire themselves You have your father's nature. You attacked directly JW would have been proud of you But my hunger has not yet settled You would give up already Here, however, I fix the pot
