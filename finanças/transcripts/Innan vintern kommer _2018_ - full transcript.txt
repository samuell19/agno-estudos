A family in the shadow of an armed rebellion Peace can never be taken for granted. Kykliky, the clock is seven. I was awake until three. I was coming up with coffee. I could not sleep. - Have you slept? - I slept like a stone. Of course... - Is it a full moon? - Not yet. Hey. Good morning. So. I go down and give Poco water. Do you take the eggs with when you still there? Have you ever heard him complain? What? Not even now. - I drive into town and trades. - No, let me. They stopped the you last. They know me. It's the same every time. - They let me through. - I'll drive. We lack everything. I would bake. There ought to be flour to buy. Do not you think? I take all my papers. Take it easy if you are stopped. Do not provoke. Do not get angry. The bells ringing and ringing. It was not like before. I do not know why. Yes, I know. But I will not think about it. I know a little. I'm just clothes. I drive into town to shop. Mother? Did you know that we are of the fish? Bleach. They climbed up on shore and became human. I've read it. - Am I a pike? - And I'm a horse. I know. - See you later. - Mom, wait a minute. Come on. I'm driving now. - Can father not act? - I do it. It is fine. - If you buy carrots to Poco? - If they have. And you're riding nowhere without saying it to dad. - You forgot your phone. - Thanks. What is it? What will you? What it is?

We'll stop them. - Keep me out, right? - Yes Yes. I promise. Far! Dad, Dad. I saw smoke over the city. What if it was a bomb? A bomb? The smoke rose into the sky, and the earth shook. I have heard nothing. You have to help me with the fence. - We have to get mom. - She'll be right. - How do you know? - She did not take the phone. She is driving. I'm riding to meet her. You do not at all. You stay here. Where have you been? Do not ride off without saying anything. - What if the phones do not work? - They do. - I just called for you. - I forgot it. Pardon. Mom probably will soon. We have to wait and see. Was it our flight? What? Forget it. Do you think they come here? Nobody comes here. We are not important to them. Of... If there should happen to us ... - If we die? - No, if mom and I now was ... If you were alone, what would you do? I would ride over to grandpa. It is well. Men... What if there was also happened grandfather something? Then I would ride off into the woods and stay there. I wanted to build a cottage - - and make a trap that the stupid would fall.

Just teach me to leave it. - But do you have an AK-47? - No. I have an ordinary hunting rifle and a shotgun. - Can you shoot people with it? - Yes, but why would anyone do that? If you now have it to ... To survive. If mom and I ... ... was forced to hide for anyone. And they came and asked you where we were. What would you do? - I do not know. What would you do? - I would not say anything. - I would shut up. - Me too. - What if they would shoot your horse? - Who would shoot my horse? They do if you can not say where we are. I would like you and shut up. It is well. It is important that you do not betray anyone. It does not help to cry. - When the mother comes, everything will be good. - Yes, it does. You then at least what I saw. Maybe it was better if you had gone. And... So. - Do not you want some? - Eat only. You've reached the voice mailbox ... I do not understand why she did not call.
