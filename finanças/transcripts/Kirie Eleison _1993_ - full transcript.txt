Real Time Tapping Report: Pillow Talk aka 'Kyrie Eleison' I've had a mark on my right breast ever since I was born. Maybe it started to bother me after I imagined... myself giving birth, and the sight of the baby suckling on my breast. Obstetrics and Gynecology However, for some reason what floats to the surface in my mind isn't a normal birth. I see the baby being taken out through something like Caesarian section. Even though I'm afraid, I think I want to know... the reason for the nightmares. Oh... sorry. Ms. Aki Kageyama "KORIN" Prescription for "Korin" Video Drug Thank you very much for purchasing the video drug "Korin" "Korin" is a video that can mentally stabilize people with psychological problems Yes... This is KORIN. Persons who wish to discuss their worries, please speak after the signal sound. Depending on what it is, the person in question will give appropriate advice. Also, don't forget to supply your full name, address, age, occupation, and phone number. I have a feeling that I'm pregnant. But if I'm pregnant, I'll have to get an abortion. Because he has a wife... No. Because I'm scared. I'm scared of giving birth. That's why... I've had enough. 'Wiretapping'? Shida, you said you'd studied counseling; I want to consult with you. All I've done is read books... Because you had a dream about a telephone instrument? That's part of it, but Inumaru, whom I teamed up with for wiretapping, had an accident, and I guess I'm feeling uneasy. Wouldn't it be best if you just stopped wiretapping? I deal with nothing but machines every day. It makes me really want to hear the voices of people. But you're still using machines for that purpose. You're good with machines, aren't you? I'm not so sure about that. New machines for wiretapping come out all the time, right? But Inumaru taught me about it. The person you just mentioned, who died in an accident? He's not dead, is he? The plant person is dead. How sad... Aki, I think you should tell Inumaru's wife about your pregnancy. Eh? Because both of you are like the front and back of a mirror to Inumaru, right? That's my advice. The KORIN video that you told me to order as materials for wiretapping has arrived. But... what should I do by myself? Please come in. Please come in. I'm sorry... So this is where it dropped. I put it on the vacuum cleaner. It's okay. I'm sorry to disturb you so suddenly. I'm not busy at all. Want something to drink? I don't know what you like. No, thank you. Did you quit your job? I don't know what Inumaru told you, but I was an 'OL'. But after what happened, I quit. But it seems like you don't go to the hospital. It wasn't so that I could be by his bedside. I... had a nervous breakdown. Erm... It's hard to say, but... I heard about you from Inumaru. You're pregnant... Is that it? I'm not the least bit surprised. So? What do you want from me? It's not like that. I just wanted to talk. Of course. Well it's your body... I can't do anything about it. Because there was a seiga above your head just now. - A seiga? - A blue moth. They come flying in when it turns to night. They eat everything up, while scattering scales from their bodies. Didn't Inumaru talk about that when he drank? Why do you suppose he was left with his eyes open? During the car accident, surely he must have seen something unexpected, right? You're out of breath. What happened? It seems your advice had the opposite effect. Oh... Is that so? I'm sorry. Actually, I came because I was worried about that. You understand well. A detective for only a day, relying on the name and telephone number, checking the map at the bookstore... And so? Are you going to help me with something again? Ah, it's tough... You're still wiretapping, aren't you? Why? I was wondering if I could assist. That's not funny. Then you're quitting? On many occasions I thought I would, but what can I say? I get addicted when I hear the sound. I want to try that sort of thing too. You want to get sick? I don't know... Since you've gone through all this trouble, would you like to stop by? Just kidding. I wouldn't say that. Of the person in the hospital... You're not drinking it? I wanted to touch something cold, to cool my head down. ?Research Commission Document? I wonder what they're going to do with this tape? This person's company requested it. They said they wanted to fire him, over a scandal. Are there a lot of them like this? Most of what I get is sex. Anyway, a lot of people want to hear other people's secretaries. Perfect. I have to confirm the payment. And so, the end. It's Miike. Are you available tonight? Hello? Was it you? The one who called me. You're Aki Kageyama, aren't you? I'm Kamizaki. Have I met you somewhere? I saw you at the hospital. At the hospital? I'm Inumaru's friend. Inumaru's... I've heard about you. Kageyama... When I heard that name, I remembered something. You were born in Nagoya, right? So what? When my father was a newspaper reporter, he often brought up the name 'Kageyama'. There was an incident at a residential area on the outskirts; a young wife was murdered by a burglar, while her husband was out of the house. Seems it was quite a tragedy. What do you want to ask me? You were doing some wiretapping with Inumaru related to KORIN, right? 'KORIN'? Both sides and one side. I'm hard to open, but you're just left open. What the hell are you looking at? What are you looking at? Are you looking at me? Are you able to see me? Your friend, a man named Kamizaki came. He asked about the KORIN wiretapping. Could it be that he's the one who asked you to do the wiretapping? The man said a strange thing... He said Inumaru can do spirit photography. It's a lie, isn't it? You took a Polaroid of me but... If you were able to do something like that, you would have shown me. Well then, try it I say. The man lent me this. I want you to take it, but you can't. I'll take it. My goggles. At that time, someone was calling me. That's what it felt like. It was like a person's voice, and also like the sound of a machine. If I must say, I felt something like the kind of electronic signal that appears in computers. Can you understand, it if I put it that way? The characters came and entered my head and whispered to me. "Go to Nagoya." I called work and said I wanted to leave early, because my condition worsened. I headed for Nagoya on the Hikari #17, which departs at 1:07 pm. I got down and stood up at the platform, but I couldn't hear anything inside my head. I'm certain I had been at my uncle's house in this area before, as a child. But that's ancient history. There's no place for me to go there now. Since I can't hear anything, there's nothing to do but return. I ran to the nearby platform and jumped aboard the Hikari #244, which departs at 3:01 pm. Shortly after passing through New Yokohama, through the window I saw the skies of Tokyo in the distance, stained an ominous colour, like blood. At that time, I wondered if the inside of my own heart was being wiretapped. That's the feeling I got. She's trying to kill the baby? It can't be... I have a feeling that it wouldn't be strange for Inumaru's wife to feel that way. When I looked at the video, I... You had another dream? What kind? I don't want to talk about it. Am I disqualified as your counsellor? I'll try to steal it. Knowing Inumaru, he might have had his own house wiretapped. I'll help you. This is my problem. # Love. Love. It's unbearable. Drink sake and fall in love. # # You laughed at me for mishearing biki and bishi. # # I fell in love with your unkind gesture. # # I turned around again and again. # # My boogie-woogie... # Sorry for disturbing you at this hour. But... I have a feeling that you're the one who injured my eye. You can really move. But you pretend to be unable to move, and watch everything going on around you. And you're in control. I followed you, yet you had it on. I feel like you're sending something to my right eye through the bandage. Are also the one who keeps calling me? What do you want to say? What do you want to show me? Hey! Are you keeping an eye on me? I'm wiretapping. Didn't you try looking under the bed at the hospital? You can't see the forest for the trees. Did I say that? Do you know what you're doing? The same thing as you! Give it back. Why would I have to return this? You know that Inumaru's wearing goggles, don't you? So what? It's hospital equipment. Inumaru went back to normal. I had a feeling he called that woman's name first. I can't forgive a thing like that! You tried to kill Inumaru and make it look like a car accident, and yet... you still have a lingering affection for him? That's not it! It's because Inumaru was wiretapping me and fishing around. That's not enough to justify attempted murder, right? I figured Inumaru would continue wiretapping you and me. That's what I feared. That's why... Besides... Inumaru made that woman find out about KORIN. I wonder why... But what on earth is KORIN? The sales of the image videos I do at my company were poor. I consulted Inumaru and the idea was born as a result. My objective was to sell tapes through a signal box. It was far more successful than I predicted, and the spontaneously started calling it a ?media religion.? He was described as a "former baker and critic of new religions". It seems like an idea typical of Inumaru. There was something interesting among the files concerning that woman gathered by Inumaru. What? There was an incident in which a married woman in the last month of pregnancy was killed by a burglar. - Oh? When was that? - A long time ago. My patient... That woman is connected with that incident. It seems Inumaru had been hiding it, but you said he could do something like spirit photography, right? Well, yeah. If Inumaru could do something like that, then maybe he knew about us through clairvoyance. Dumb ass! More importantly, there aren't any bugs in this place, are there? I checked over and over, so it's safe. Goddamn. My nerves are going crazy... Help! I'm going to be killed! Don't play pranks. Mama! Help! Who are you? Where are you calling from? My body is becoming a wiretap. Close your eyes, dear. You want to be with me, don't you? Hello. Aki? It's me. You were wiretapping me, weren't you? I heard you had files concerning Aki, so I figured I'd try to look for them. Let me go! You! This person made me stab. Do you believe me? If I hadn't wiretapped their conversation, I might not have. What did you hear? A discussion about how this person had a special ability to do something, like spirit photography. I've read books about psychic abilities before. Among them, there was a story of people whose hidden powers were awakened through accidents. Are you saying it was the same with Inumaru? Aki, you're the only one who would know that. Don't touch that. Show me, too. Even if you see, you won't understand. Fine. Then why did you consult with me and team up with me? Father recognized the signs in mother when she was around 8 months pregnant. When her strong desire to give birth to her own child was about to be fulfilled, she was overwhelmed with the uneasiness called tokophobia. Through the phone, she started talking with me, who lurked within her body. "Help me, Aki... Help me." While screaming that, she continued to fight with the uneasiness of pondering the coming birth of the important child. But father was still shaken. He started having wild delusions. He wondered if the child wasn't his. The knife point thrust by father wounded the right breast of the baby. "You get aroused when you stroke the scar, dear." You said that before. He felt something inside your consciousness, Aki. By having you look into KORIN, he was trying to find the roots of your uneasiness. Surely that's it. You were that important to him. That's why he hurt those who got too close. He was trying to make an agreeable response. Wait. I can save you now. I wanted to search inside my own body. You let me do it. This is me. Look... look inside my body. Don't go inside my head. Don't call me. It seems you wanted to have an abortion, but this is a phantom pregnancy. Well, take care of your body. Are you okay? You had a nightmare, because of the anesthesia. It's a lie... Give me back my baby. Give me back my baby, that was taken out through Caesarian section. It's mine. Eh? Cut the circuit. Is that what you said, dear? You want to die, don't you? The wiretapping is complete...
