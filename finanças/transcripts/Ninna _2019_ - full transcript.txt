"The floor is spinning! I'm fucking drunk." "Where's my paper? Stupid cow!" "Let me put your feet up. Do you want a blanket?" "Where are your slippers? Do you want a beer?" "Why are you always moving the furniture around?" "You can't find a bloody thing!" "Where's my paper? You ugly bitch!" Don't give him a blanket. Let him freeze till his balls drop off. He shouldn't put his feet up. He needs to get out of this house. Let's roll him in the paper. Then he can lie in the trash and choke on his own vomit. 34 years later The name's Ninna. I love my job at the chippie and the small piss town I live in. My Dennis. He still doesn't put the seat down after pissing - - in spite of many years of training, - - but I'm proud of him. Dennis is a really good kid. He and I have always been a great support to each other. Mum, that's totally illegal. MEN ARE PIGS Dennis turns 18 today. Unfortunately, we can't celebrate together - - because his band's playing at a party down by the harbour. Happy birthday! What time is it? It's December 8th. You wake me up at 6 AM to say happy birthday? How did you get this big? It's steroids from the gym. Did they say how long it'll take before they have an effect? Eh? Mum! Really. My mum. A considerate woman who always puts others before herself. I want more decorations, Ninna. I want them all up. Don't you want to come? It's so ugly when you can't get rid of your defecation. It was terribly painful. My tummy was so bloated. Could we talk about the party, Mum? I tried to massage it with lotion. You know, around the anus. Judith was kind enough to help me. Are you even listening? Yes, Mum! Of course I am. It's a wonderful Christmas story we can all learn a lot from. Where do you think you're going? I have to go. Jeanette has been good enough to take my shift. Really? And who has to approve it? My mum is dying, unfortunately. How often have you used that line? Your mum must be terribly feeble. It's not you we're laughing at. I've just opened a new laughter club. We meet on Sunday at 2 PM. You do? Are you aware that Danes laugh for only about 6 to 7 minutes a day? That's a lot. There's no obligation. Just turn up. If you're not up for it, you leave. I'm not joining some laughter club. I'm in the shithouse with my ex. I have to go. It's important. What have you got planned? A celebration for my kid, Ole. Does the costume fit? It's perfect. Jeanette and I are so grateful for the Santa's helper costumes. So why aren't you wearing it? I'm a human, not a pixie. Wear it tomorrow. It sends out a message. What is the message of this costume? Besides not looking cheap as usual. If you've got a fetish for women dressed as Santa's helpers, - - then move to Greenland. I love you, Jesus! Happy birthday! Got you. Dennis, Dennis, Dennis! Is this for me? This is crazy. Yes, man! Where are we going, Dennis? Blind Man's Bluff Blind Man's Bluff Mum... Yes? Okay, are you ready? Yes. Surprise. What do you think? It's great. Thanks, Dennis. Why do you say thanks? It's mine. I've gotten this flat. Okay. Did you trade our flat? Are we moving? No, that's not what I'm saying. Hallo? You've found a new flat for us, but we're not moving? I don't get it. It's my flat. My own. I can move in when I want to. I can do whatever I bloody like. It's mine. Mum... He's not moving anywhere. The kid's a teenager. Sexually frustrated. Teenagers get a hard-on from driving the bus. And then they start doing all that graffiti business. Do you want a new set of teeth? No. Then stop calling my kid sexually frustrated. I've just briefly explained the matter to my cousin. You've got the ball. And my cousin has had five teenagers in the house. So listen to my lecture, girl. Listen up. Are you ready for this pearl of wisdom? Just fucking say it! He's saying that you have to practice what they call active listening - - and then you say, It's not too soon or too late: "I'm fine with you moving out. But let's look at your finances and what it'll cost you each month." That way you show that they have the right to move when they've turned 18. But the key word being... finances. You're coming with me. Come with me. Come on. I hear what you're saying. And I understand what you're saying. And it's exciting you've got this flat, Dennis. But we have to communicate. It's why we have language. Am I meant to say something back now, mum? Yes, please, Dennis. You're a big boy. Now the two of us communicate. I'm tired of living at home. You're interfering in my life. Sometimes, not all the time, it's as if... you're taking it out on me that you haven't got a man. And now I can rent the flat from Snooker Christian. Well, it all sounds great. Do you have anything else to add? Have you started taking drugs? And now you want a sex change and want to live on the moon - - and raise a child there with a lovely man? Okay. But... Good. It's fine with me if you move out. But let's have a look at - - what it'll cost you each month, your finances. My finances are fine. I've drawn up a budget and... I've got my wages. I'll just do as I do when I manage our budget. Spend less than I earn. And no to the drug part. And I won't have a sex change, either. I've found a girlfriend. Say again. I've found a girlfriend. Well, I'm deeply moved. Will I be allowed to meet her? Before you realize she's banging all of your friends. Mum, seriously! I'm moving out. I might want to live with Maria. Tell me, are you filming me? Eh? Am I in some kind of YouTube video? Dennis, you're not moving anywhere. And that Maria... I have said yes to the flat. It's mine! And I would like the 230 euros that you owe me. Who in their right mind would call their daughter Maria? They must have had a puerperal psychosis. Doesn't it sound like some brain-dead blonde in silver sandals? "What should we name her?" "I don't know. I'm a bit tired." "How about Maria?" "Yes, good idea. For now." I don't know any Marias. Well, Jesus' mum, of course. Isn't Maria the type who gets pregnant without even... You're funny. Dennis here. Leave a message. It's me. I've called you ten times. Do you think you could call me back? Bye. Grethe from Station Road - - ended up seeing a psychologist when her daughter left home. And she was 35. The mother? No. The daughter, for god's sake. Dennis! You have to learn to let go of your son, Ninna. There's a big difference... It's my child you're talking about. Do you smoke pot? Excuse me? You're talking incredibly slowly. At 110 euros an hour, I'd be better off with someone who speaks faster. We do lose rather a lot of words because of the pace. We're in a hurry. We need to get my kid home. Why do you think I say these things to you, Ninna? I'd like you to really search yourself before you answer. You're asking this because you're incompetent. The alarm bells should start ringing if the psychologist asks the client - - why the client thinks the psychologist says what she says! Dennis here. Leave a message. Hi, kiddo. Well, I've been to a psychologist. Just to think all of this through. I told her - - that you look forward to being grown up and living on your own. She totally got it. In fact, she was very understanding. She saw everything from your side. It's called the diabolical puberty. She was very positive about the two of us. There aren't many who have as close a connection as you and me. That's also why it's particularly painful - - if one of us hurts the other. Especially at Christmastime. Yes. But call me, right? Bye, bye. What are you doing? It's a declaration of love for my new neighbour. I've noticed your fondness for bangs and bullets. Where's the declaration of love? China can't do shit. Are you happy now? Next time it's a hand grenade. Find a biker club that needs a new man... or woman. You are a woman, right? Most murders are committed by people who already know each other. Well, then come on in. At least tell me if the party was a success. It bloody well was, Mum. There wasn't a dry eye in the house. The kid was so grateful that he has moved out. Goodbye to 18 years. Thanks for all you've done. Merry Christmas. It had to happen. Are you demented? What? Am I using words you don't understand? I'm saying my kid moved. Little Judith was so lucky to change her shifts. Now she can drive her daughter to her riding school. That's lovely, Mum. Let's hope she won't get kicked in the head by a horse. Now you're a cheapskate. What about the other hand, foolish little girl? Mum has two hands. I just have to close up here. You've got everything? Yes. Good evening. Hi. I'm Dennis' mum. Antonio. Ninna. Come here, honey. It's Dennis' mum. Elena. Ninna. Would you like a cup of coffee? Yes, please. Please come in. Take a seat. I'll get the youngsters. Hi. Hi. What are you up to? How do you know where Maria lives? I've brought your gift calendar, Dennis. It's good that your mum's here. Come. Take a seat. We're so fond of Dennis. We're so happy that Maria has found a sensible young man. Dennis is welcome here any time. No, he's not. There's something called freedom with responsibility. I'm 18. I can do whatever the hell I like. Dennis is going through a clingy/let go phase. I gave him freedom because I can trust him. But I need to know where he is. Yes, of course. If we don't prove our worth as parents, the two of them will think - - that they're going to go all the way. Have you seen "Teen Moms"? It's my impression that they are sensible young people. Why don't you leave? I'm having coffee with your in-laws. Perfectly normal. There'll be a lot of these in the future. This is a rehearsal. You'll have a steady stream of girlfriends. Then I'll get to know people from all over the world. Right now, it's nice to play Monopoly with a girl from... It may well be that the youngsters will stay together. They've been dating for six months. Later on, they might have plans to... Plans, my arse! Go! You're so fucking embarrassing! Your hormones are raging. No, your hormones are raging. Don't you take that tone with me! What happens in Istanbul when you speak like that to your mum? I wouldn't know. I'm from Croatia. Did you see "Not Without My Daughter"? Open that gift calendar. Just fucking do it now! I'm sorry you feel this way. No! I'm the one who's sorry! Don't take my Dennis from me. He's unstable and not equipped to handle all of this. You have to choose. Me or the vampire! Come here! Either you go now and we talk another day. Or you stay, and you'll never see me again. Show some fucking respect! Were you spying at the window? Were you? Thank you for a great night. It's been super unforgettable. Next time I'll bring my mild mother. And we can all wear silly hats. Do you have plans for New Year's Eve? Think about it. Shit. LET GO OF YOUR CHILD I can't be alone, Mum. I don't know what to do. He won't come home. Can't you call him? No, Ninna. My heart is pounding like crazy and I can't breathe. Wait a couple of days. If the anxiety doesn't pass, you'll need pills. Don't be afraid of medicine. In the States they say... Fuck the States! Their president is five years old! Don't bad-mouth Trumf just because Dennis wants a new mum. Shut your mouth! No, you shut your mouth! Hi. If you're about to lose it again, you're welcome to come in. I've got a punchbag. You don't have to throw things at people then. I'm not losing it. Or out the window. Nice T-shirt. Set up a dating profile instead of hitting on me. I did. I don't really think it worked. Is there a photo? Will you reply? I think you should expect replies from women with a rather low IQ. Maybe we are having love life issues ourselves? Where do I find the woman I can grow old with? You are old! So what was the reason? You can't lead a normal conversation with a teenager. But what did he say? He's got his finances sorted. He made a lot of excuses. What were the exact words? He feels that I'm taking it out on him that I haven't got a man. Here you are. Thanks. Bo just proposed to me. I see. And what did you say? I said yes. You shouldn't answer when you're drunk. I wasn't drunk. I was very happy, I almost broke down and cried. Give it half a year. Then the breakdowns come rolling in. You'll sit behind the bars and look out at all the happy singles. Can you say "alimony"? It's love, Ninna. A man only spends a fortune on a basket if he's got a crush on you. Yes, or if he's a sicko. My kid has left me. What's my consolation prize? A stalker neighbour. In two days, I'll be found dismembered in the bicycle shed. Are you allowed to join up flats? Do you mind, Mum? I'm telling you the man's an idiot. There are two of them. Will you put them in my room? Look at that! I think someone just got a new pair of glasses! Come over here, Judith. Let me look at you. You look so snazzy in those! Doesn't she look great, Ninna? Dennis here. Leave a message. Okay, Ole. This is what Santa's helper should look like. Dear chip shops in Vordingborg, Stege, Præstø. Dear friends. I love you. It's such a pleasure to be gathered here today, new and old employees. I just want to remind you that tomorrow is a new day, - - when the chippies will be open and customers will demand the very best. You're grown-ups. I'm counting on you. Have fun. And drink responsibly. We know what we're doing. It's too strange if I have to call your ex for you. Call her yourself. The bitch won't talk to me. She's not answering my calls. Maybe she's just busy fucking some other bastard? Yes. What the hell am I to do? I'm touching rock bottom. I haven't felt this bad since I was a boy scout. Did you do anything to her? No. No, I... I just rang her doorbell sometimes when I passed her house. And what more? I sent some letters. Threatening letters? No, god damn it. Letters proclaiming my love for her. Why won't you help me? Did you do more to her? No. Well, I did scratch the car of her new boyfriend. Stop it! You're making me so horny. I love you. Let go of me! Let go! Just a nice, little quickie. Nein! Bye! Say hi to the staff at the chippie. See you. Shit! Business is slow? Christmas party. And I'm sober, so forget it. Why aren't you sitting on your couch? Because my door needs keys. Did you call anybody? The battery's dead. Do you want to borrow my phone? Should I let you box? I've been training since I was born. I also know karate. Yes... The phone! Yes. Here you are. Dennis here. Leave a message. Oh, is it little Dennis who's sucking all the blood out of a vampire? I've locked myself out in the middle of the night stark naked - - with an unpredictable and violent man. When you're done having sex in an open coffin, come and help me. It's the least you can do after everything I've done for you. On your way out of a relationship? My son. But... doesn't your son's father have keys? He's the type who manages doors without keys. He's a magician? Sort of. Love-hate relationship? No, murderhate. Do you have children? No. So what's this? Oh, that is just... I'm taking the bus driver test next Friday. If I pass, they've promised me the route to Næstved. I have to pass. Coffee? Yes, please. Morten, 52, living in Præstø Seek young blonde, 25-30 Here. Isn't this a bit too clichéd? What? Does she have to be a blonde? I've just always thought that blondes were a little... Cheap. It's not a must. Brunettes can also be... So there you are. A true princess. Like kicked out of a fairy tale. Want to play? If your son's not coming, you can sleep on the couch. I've got a duvet. Would you like to try being with a really hot girl? What? So is it your own hair? Hey, you. No, no, not my hands! I earn a living as a pianist. If you stay here tonight, we'll have breakfast together. Okay? Ouch! Let go of me, bus driver! Dennis! Yes? You promised to have breakfast with me. I can't do this. It won't work out. Okay. I just need to get my kid back home. I understand that. So it's not a good time right now. Or rather, it never will be. 32.05 euros. And a withdrawal? Yes, please give me 10,000. The psychologist suggested you return home for a while. You need to "hold your horses" was the way she put it. She suggested I could pay you to live at home. 500 euros a month. What do you say? I think it's a lot of money. But we can discuss it on Christmas Eve. Hi. 10.19 euros, please. On my credit card, please. Do you need the receipt? No, thanks. Have a lovely day. Thanks, you too. We can talk about it. I'm not celebrating Christmas with you. I don't want to celebrate Christmas with you! Thursday at 3 PM Did you lose a loved one? Everyone's welcome Thank you for listening to me. It was a really good feeling. Hi. My name's Ninna. I read on the notice that everyone's welcome. Yes. Welcome. If Jesus exists and he loves me and he can create miracles, - - why doesn't he go ahead and do so? "I love you unconditionally, - - so I'll let the sky fall down upon you - - while you're throwing up your lungs in grief." I've... I've lost my son. Dennis isn't there anymore. I think it's particularly hard for me because I was alone with him. And now it's Christmas. When I look back, I can see where it all went wrong. Even though it's not easy to admit as a mother, - - I can see that Dennis changed when he got to know Maria. There were signs. It would help me if we could write him a letter. I know what it should say, but it has to be phrased - - so that it makes him cry and really feel how much I love him. Maybe we have to start living together in another way - - if there's something that's hard for him in the diabolical puberty. We're a group who come together because we've lost a loved one. As I experience what you've just said - - it sounds to me as if you've come to the wrong place. I'm not. I'm supposed to be here with you. It's unfortunate if the sign can be understood... Is it every Thursday at 3 PM? I have to stop you now, Kira. Ninna! I'm not in the wrong place. I need to be here! I won't drag you down each time with all of my shit. I've also got some positive stories. I really have to stop you. See you. See you. Bye, bye. Hi. I haven't had a drink in two years. If I can find a restaurant without a knife and fork, do you want to come? There's no way I'm going on a date with a man from AA. Ninna, listen... No, you listen! My parents were alcoholics and I have a child with one. You never stop drinking. Because you can't. You can only hurt other people. And when you feel guilty about the shit you put other people through - - you seek comfort the only way you know how. By drinking! I haven't seen my dad in 30 years because he's a boozer! And so are you. You're a fucking drunkard! Disguised as a sober man! You know what? I fully understand why your son wants to leave home. You only think of yourself. You've got good eyes and don't understand why others judge you. Take a look at yourself. Why are you like that? I know why I was drinking. But you're not even aware that you're a selfish bitch, are you? It's Christmas soon. Is your son coming? No, I didn't think so. You can't sleep there. I'm not allowed to have guests. Not like that. You can't bloody well lie there. What do I do when I need a bath? The rats will come out of the sewer tonight and eat you. I'm not feeling very well, Mum. I feel as if everything just... Good morning, girls! Are you ready for Christmas? Have you never learned to knock? I did knock on the door. This is my mum's home. She's paying rent. So you need to knock. Yes. You are right. In the future, I'll... What? Grow a brain? Stop it. Judith is so sweet and she always knocks on the door. How are you? Snug as a bug in a rug. And soon it'll be Christmas. Do you want your medicine now? No thanks, sweetie. I'll just wait. You're so lovely, little Judith. I don't know what I'd have done without you. My little sunbeam. Look, you came. And now the sun is shining. When your lesbian show is over, maybe you can tell me - - why I am the way I am. I don't know, Ninna. You're just born that way. Nobody's just born that way. Ever heard of nature and nurture? We were completely normal. Bordering on the dull. For several years, - - each day I expected a UFO to land on our lawn. Because they'd changed their mind and wanted Ninna back. What do you mean? You were difficult. Even back then. Life's tough, Ninna. Either you start crying or you start laughing. It's obvious that you chose the laughing option. Yes, of course I have. And in a minute, it's Christmas! Yes, Mum! A Christmas without my child! Oh, damn, here comes trouble. Ninna, put on the costume. Ninna, put on that costume now. Glad to see you in your costume. Let me look at you. Spin around. You're so fine. Santa's cute little helper. I have to fire Connie in Stege. I just couldn't get her to wear it. It sure as hell isn't pretty. You think life is just a game. When the little wife has shown you some love - - because she's still got the hots for you, I bet you sit hand in hand - - and laugh at her old boyfriends. My wife's not sitting at home. Did you look in on the knitting club? Are you sure she's really there? My wife's dead. Then it's very unseemly to start a laughing club. Bodil died three years ago. Why do you think I spend so much time at your chippie? My mum calls me all the time. "What are you doing? Where are you?" Do you have ketchup? It's because your mum loves you. Right. She wants to look after her kid. Right. What do you love most about your mum? Nothing. How many women have you upset? How many have you lied to? How many times did you break your promises because of drinking? How often was alcohol more important to you than the people who loved you? An awful lot of times. But I did say I'm sorry. Do you ever say sorry? The road to hell is paved with excuses. Bad excuses. Not the same thing. We are responsible for our lives! Don't quote your AA leaflets to me. Find a younger woman. I'm trying to do just that. The mails keep coming since I lowered the age limit. Where is your son's dad? Huh? I haven't a clue. The last time I saw him, he kicked in the door, - - threw me on the floor and nearly broke my shoulder. He took my scarf and tried to strangle me. I woke up in an ambulance. Dennis was four years old. He ran around the parking lot screaming. An old cow found him. She lived in your flat and died in your bedroom two years ago. Just where you have your ugly bed. Who's going to hold you? Huh? You heard me. Who's going to hold you? You need to find a women who'll believe that you won't drink again. I want somebody who wants me with all my baggage. In my airline, I'm afraid we've had to establish limits - - as to how much heavy baggage we can take. Dennis? What's up? Do you have extra keys to the flat? What do you need them for? To commit suicide in Dennis' flat. Hang on. I'll just find them. Are you busy down at the chippie? Here you are. He can keep them. I promised him two sets. What are you doing here? I cleaned the flat. Look, I can totally understand why you're pissed off at me. So that's why I came here to tell you I'm sorry. How did you get in? With the keys. You can keep them. Did you get them copied, so that you can come in - - when me and Maria are banging? I love you. You're a loser. What? You're a fucking loser. I'm your mum. I don't want anything to do with you, Mum! You ruin everything! I'm so embarrassed that you're my mother. You're a fucking loser! Get out! Out! Earth calling Ninna. What are you doing? Where are you going, Mum? Take your jacket. Where are we going? Take your jacket, I said. And take mine. I need help. I'm disabled, for god's sake! You haven't been outside the door for two years. Get that jacket. Where do you want to go? It's not right that you're not together on Christmas Eve. We're going to the vampire's parents. I don't want to see you like this. You're a warrior. I've already been. It didn't turn out well. Because you didn't bring your mum. Go faster. Come on, push harder. Push! I'm Dennis' grandmother. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. I'm Dennis' grandmother. We just want to say hi to the little squirt. I hope you don't mind my wheelchair. If the wheels make your floor dirty, I can leave it out here - - and twist along the floor like some odd worm. No. No, come on in. Mum! Grandma! In Bulgaria, you also stick together as a family, right? I've never been there. So I'm not the right person to answer that. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Let me be the first to regret the last visit, if you can say that. Ninna lacks tact. But her big heart makes her... And what the hell do you lack? Do you know how embarrassing you are? You don't just turn up uninvited. And definitely not on Christmas Eve. That's what Santa does. He also turns up without being invited. Isn't that true? Yes. And you must be Maria! Hi. Well... Please sit down. Let me take away a chair. I know your mum looks like a porno model. Mum! Sorry. Former porno model. Okay, Mum. Let's get out of here. Sit down, Ninna! I'm proud that Ninna is my girl. I wouldn't trade her for anything in the world. She's bloody difficult. But Ninna has a gift that most people don't have. She expresses what's inside of her. Most people are so full of lies. With Ninna what you see is what you get. Now, take bloody China... Thanks, Mum. Stop. Let me help you. Let's get this off. It's covered in dessert now. Leave it, Mum! Stop it now! Give it to me when I tell you to. It's a baby. Ho, ho, ho! Are there any well-behaved children in here? Santa Claus. Maria's having a baby. No, she's not. Yes, it's true. There's a little one in there. Dennis and I are having a baby. I don't understand... Can anyone help me? What is that? We were too afraid to tell you. Why don't you say anything? We're going to move in together. Yes. We'll live in the flat. Dennis will buy a used pram. His mum owes him some money. She often does. What about your studies, Maria? A child giving birth to a child. It's Christmas Eve! And Maria's having a baby! That's just perfect. How old are you, my girl? 17. Why don't you say anything, you idiot? Well... I was only 21 when I had you. And it turned out just fine. You're working in a chip shop. My Maria will have an education. Don't you badmouth my workplace. It's not the end of the world. Maria can still study. Get a grip, be a man and support your daughter. I can't do this. You have to leave. All of you. I'm sorry. Out. Everybody, out. Out. Not you, not you. Everybody else, out. Dennis, wait! I'm going to be Dennis' grandma. This is just so far out. No, you'll be the child's grandma. And I'll be its great grandma. I've still got my own teeth. Do you think the baby will develop fangs? Thanks, Mum. Good morning, Helen. It's time to wake up. You have to leave dreamland now. Helen. Helen? Helen. Helen! What's going on? Your mother... on your way be true be brave on your way to Jesus Yes. Do I need to sugarcoat this? I can't have an employee who doesn't turn up. My mum has died. Yeah, right. - You're fired. - What? You can't be serious. You bet I'm serious. You're fired! I've been in your chip shop for 12 years and never let you down before. No. But ... I'll be there tomorrow. Or better, I'll come right now. I'll just come this minute. - You're fired. - I'll drop by. Goodbye! Hallo? Hallo? Mum. What are you doing? Come on out, Mum. Okay? For god's sake. Come out. Get the fuck out of there! Verner, it's Mum. What do you say? It's my mum. She's going mad. Ninna girl? Dennis says you've been lying here for hours. Are you coming out soon? Are you? God damn it. Everything's such a mess. Grandma's dead and I am... I'm bloody well not having a child. I've still got pimples, for god's sake. I'm moving back home. I'm moving back home, Mum. Mum? No... It doesn't always help to laugh. No. Yes? I had a chat with Verner. He told me that your mum really is... you know. So my deepest congratulations. And also... No, no, I mean my deepest condolences! And then I also wanted to tell you that your customers miss you. So, Ninna, god damn it, - - you're hired again. Think about it. Do we just carry it all inside? Hey, guys. Great! Yes, carry it all to my room. That's fine. I don't mean to push you, but I'm really in trouble here. We're behind with the cleaning and the groceries are delivered tomorrow. I don't know what to do. Could you maybe start tomorrow? Great, Ninna. Hi. Is it good to be back? Mm. Now you're home again, right? Now everything will be fine. We always work things out. We help each other. Are you and Maria okay? Here you are. That'll be 22.20 euros. Yes? I'm really sorry about your mum. To Ninna From Mum Why don't you call Maria? No. Never mind. What? What is it? You're my kid and I love you. And you're not going to live here. But I just moved back in. We need to move your shit out again, Dennis. You can't just kick me out. You can't live alone. Grandma's dead and all of that. Then I'll have to learn. You have to live in that flat. But she wants to live with her parents. They want her to. Because you don't stand your ground. I can't look after a little baby. Stop! Listen to what I'm saying! You can do this because I say so. I'll help you with the suckling. But you have to live in that flat. Now get out before I throw your shit out the window. What about the 500 euros for living at home? Nice try. And no. What am I going to say? "Hi! I look like a cartoon figure, but only due to my father's genes. I love your daughter. And if anyone's going to be a good dad, then it's fucking me." And then you give her flowers. I can't give her those old flowers. They're plastic flowers, dummy. Go! I did. No, you didn't. Do you know why there are always 17 blondes outside the disco? Because they've heard you have to be 18 to get in. Who's she? This is my younger sister. Okay. Not. What does the blonde say after ten years of studies? "Welcome to McDonald's." And what do you call a blonde with two brain cells? Pregnant. Teresa just qualified as a dentist. And this is extremely bad timing. We might need to hire a relationship counsellor. But I want you. We've just started a relationship. What? What? No way! Yes. Now, listen. I want you with all your baggage. Did he say he's an alcoholic? A sober alcoholic. I want to ride in your bus. You have to go now. I need a few words with Teresa. No. You know what? You really don't need to bother. I'm throwing in the towel. My life is complicated as it is. Come here, you stupid bitch. We'll move to a detached house. Oh, no, we're not. When Jesus said: "Love each other the way I love you, - - it's a rather big demand on the whole of humanity - - running around with their heads up their arses. Also, don't forget that you can never know - - how much wine Jesus had drunk before uttering those words. I still love him, but what if we all hate ourselves - - for something a man once happened to say in a drunken haze. Hi, Dad. It's me. Ninna. Can we meet up? No storm lasts forever, no matter how fierce it is. Dennis is now the father of a 7 pound 5 oz, heavy vampire boy. And I've worked a lot with myself. I've become totally normal. I've learnt to keep all of my impulses under control. Subtitles: Malene Hollnagel Scandinavian Text Service 2018
