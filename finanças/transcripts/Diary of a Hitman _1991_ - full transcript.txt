Hi, this is koenig. Leave a message. It better be good news. Hey, koenig ...! Koenig, pick up the phone. Okay, my turn to leave a message here. You're gonna get into a lot of trouble for all this shit. See? I care. Hey, but you're $20,000 richer, right? You're okay. Crazy-ass days, huh? I thought of myself as an average working slob. I mean, maybe my job was a little different... Hired killer, hitman, whatever you wanna call it, but the way I looked at it, I was a pro. A pro is a pro, right? Ha! Bullshit! Was full of myself, my life was driving me nuts, I started to fall apart in every way. I wanted something better! Why not? I mean other people seem to manage to be able... I mean, guys are a lot dumber than me seem to be able to get together... Purely business. Nothing personal. Our motto, huh, koenig? Was losing it. I thought I could just patch things up, get a quick fix. I mean, who do you go to? Certainly not you! Who can you talk to, make you feel better about yourself without ending up in the state pen? So I went to this psychiatrist. I pretended the hit I just did was part of a dream I had. What's your bet I'm not the first guy who ever lied to a shrink. I... I don't get to use the couch here? No, no. That comes later. Please, sit. You comfortable? Yeah, I'm fine. Good. So, you were referred to me by ...? Guy at the bar I was drinking with. I got his number written down here somewhere. No, no, no, it's okay! It's just a formality. Skinny white guy with, like, a mole right here... Said that you turned his life around. Sometimes I have these had dreams. Tell me about your dreams. Oh yeah, I could tell you any dream I want to? Recent. Like last night, for instance. This one's weird. This dream is... I'm in this underground car park. And there's this guy... Why? Why? Tell me why? Somebody told you I was scamming? No way! No way! I can describe his face to you. He was scared shit. Were you the guy? = no, no, this is a whole different guy. This guy... We're wrestling in this... = opn grave. = this is ridiculous! I... Not the underground car park? No, will you listen to me for a second? I'm trying to tell you! This guy, he goes: “1 got a brilliant idea!” I've got a brilliant idea! Nothing personal. Purely business. And this one needs girls, there, see? These topless titty girls? Uh, they came out of the grave? No, no. Out of the, uh... Radio city music hall, you know? The rockettes! With the... With the legs and the... boobs! And money! Money's falling out of the sky into my... I thought you said this was a bad dream. Hm, yeah... Out of curiosity, do you rent or do you own? Do you have a fantasy about where I live? = no. I have a fantasy about the juiciest rockette doing the splits on my face. Well, uh... Sometimes a rockette is just a rockette. I checked where you live. Duquesne heights. Classy. I see. Uh, mister ...? = Smith. John Smith. Hm. I think that I should point, uh, out that, uh... Psychotherapy is not for everyone. Are you saying I don't belong here? I can't afford it, maybe? No, I'm not suggesting that. But... butitis a rigorous discipline. Th... this is not a judgment on you. I just think you... Please, sir, use the door on your left. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Pittsburgh's fabulous winterfest. A warm celebration of the first season of the year. A snowmobile competition is about to begin. What a mistake! Sometimes, a shrink is just a shrink. Man, he couldn't help me feel better. Only I could. And now, I knew I wanted out. I mean, I'd just do one more gig. It couldn't hurt. Get the down payment for my co-op then I'd kick it, pure and simple. Get out, retire. You know, retire? Exit. Fade away. Over. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Pittsburgh's fabulous winterfest, a warm celebration of the first season of the year. Hey, boss, how're you doing? =you're late. I've been thinking. I need a vacation. But I need the cash to buy my apartment. I'm not happy about your work last night. You got your ways, but you're getting a little wild. You know what's funny? I've been doing this for a long time and I never met a guy that didn't ask me "why?" First. I never met a guy that didn't deep down inside know the answer to the question himself. Lemon drop? = no thanks. Look, it's over now. Christ! A parking garage, of all places? It must've sounded like bowling Saturday night, huh? I mean, couldn't you have taken him outside to some nice quiet potato field? What do you got against spuds? What do you care, as long as you get your cut? I worry about the noise factor. I worry about you. All the time rubbing your arm. And I worry about shandy downtown. Shandy? Ha! Get outta here! Come on! Assault with intent's the worst thing on my rap sheet. Ain't nothing to connect me with no murder. Really? Well the buzz is: Shandy's got a hard-on to put you back inside. One way or the other. Dekker, I just want you to shape up. I care about you. And you're falling apart on me, for Christ's sake. Look you just line up the work. The day after tomorrow, I close on my place. I need the bucks, man. And you'll get elephant bucks for this job! - Gimme a pass. - All right, go deep! Hut, hut, hut! Hey, girl, how're you doing? Hey, want a biscuit? Damn you, getting me all upset over shandy. I'm thinking: “I'm a pro, they don't forget that. The photo was there, the letter with the instructions... But there was double my usual money down payment. What was I getting? Pension and welfare contributions? Hey, how you doing? Such a good girl, such a good girl... Don't you hate running into a guy who's wife you're nailing? I mean, what do you say to the guy? "Is it cold enough for you?" "How is our little woman? S50, you attending the tenants' meeting tonight? = I'm hooked. Hot date. Well, you know, if uh... If one tenant breaks the no-buy pledge, we're all penalized. Hey, you do understand that. Don't you? What's important is that we all gotta stick together, okay? It is us against the sponsor, do you understand that? - Gotcha. - So tonight, 8 o'clock, if you think you can break that engagement. Okay? We all got to stick together. Poor little pissant. I was thinking... Maybe I should break that engagement, stand up his wife. Nah. Sheila would punish us both. So I'm really doing him a favour. God! Ain't life a trip? It's message time. Always some last words of wisdom from old king koenig, my rabbi. Hey, I bought you some technology. A silencer. I'm having it delivered. Now, the hit expects a TV repairman, so look the part. She's the only tenant. The building's a tomb! What do you think? Is shandy on to you? I can't make up my mind. Anyway, just be cool. It's Sheila. We're on for tonight, 8 o'clock. Monday, 2:15, Marvin sadler, your trusty broker, well, you've bought yourself your apartment! Yup. Congratulations! All that's left to do is to rock'n'roll with the down payment! The day after tomorrow, no later! Bye-bye! Marvin again. Remember, we'll need your w2s. Thanks. W2s I'll get conan to send in the forms. Hey, dekker! Guess who? Special request, buddy! The clown wants to meet you in person. Now, now, I know this is unusual... But Mr. al zidzyck, our paymaster, will not take no for an answer, and we aim to please, right? St. Joseph church, on berford. Four o'clock sharp. Don't be late. Are you hiding your money again? In the radiator, I bet! You shithead... I hadn't been in a church since my grandma died. She was in an open casket. Gave me the shit fits. Me! Imagine... Maybe it was the makeup that did it, I dunno. I swore that was gonna be my one last time. Now, in a way, it was another funeral that was bringing me back. Thanks for coming. You believe in god? This ain't smart. I don't understand why we're having this meeting. I already got the information in the letter. I didn't for a long time. I've been in hell. Jain dragged me down. =- names. Never tell me names. I function better when the pop isn't personal. One thing: Why am I getting my whole fee up front? I'm not proud of my past. Snorted a number of prime years of my life away. Her doing. She made me crazy. Look. Maybe I'm talking myself out of a job, here... Why don't you just get a divorce. Whoa! What are you ...? Sit down! She has stuff on me! Another mistake I made. My trusting nature. She's... hurt me in a lot of ways. Can I share something with you? Not necessary. Six months ago, I took Jesus as my saviour, and in return, this is what he did for me. I'm truly blessed. Commodities .. What's your problem? I mean, you have something wrong with your eyes? This light... You gotta be a bat. I would say... The name koenig gave me was zidzyck. I changed it. Professional reasons. - Commodities. - The lord provides. Unimaginable high. Drug pales in comparison. Sad to say, jain... = names! Helplessly addicted. You know, you really don't have to tell me all these things, I don't... Ask my codependency group. They'll tell you. It's her life or mine. I see they tell you to contact me, these guys? That's funny ...! Fucking bitch is killing me. Not like her sister. I ot easier on the nerves. Couple of fur coats, a trip to St. Thomas... Not my life's blood! Look if you just tell me why I'm here... I'll do this job for you. - There's a baby. - What baby? Jain's an infant. You expect me to do it in front of a kid? You better talk to koenig about that. Go ahead and call your Mr. koenig. I'm sure you have a quarter on you. There's $20,000 in that envelope. This is not the full amount! This is twice the down payment. You wanted this no squeeze of the trigger, you head out the door. = I'll be damned. Hard to bring up casually... How old is the kid? Personal, remember? How old? He's a few months. Doesn't walk or talk. I'm letting you charge me full rate for what's technically a half-fare. Wait a minute, you... you're not under the impression... This is my kid? This is one of jain's drug-pusher boyfriend's or I don't know. She won't say whose it is. I gotta think it. [T's a crack baby. It's pathetic to look at. You'd be doing it a favour. Tomorrow night! Then or never! Fucking koenig! Babies now... What a lousy goddamn night! Man, I was at the limit, I kept thinking to myself: What was my life coming to? I mean, I couldn't sleep. No way. So I had to get out of the house. If I see the whole gang, yeah, see Clyde... that'll help. Clyde. Oh, man... Oh, man... Oh, man! It's good to see you! - How you doing, young fella? - Good you want some beer? Yeah, yeah. Um... draft. Draft. Where's Avery at? I don't see his silly ass nowhere. Lung cancer. You outta touch. = Charlie d.? Damn... I don't see none of the guys! Hm. You're a stranger yourself! What's the matter? No time for the old neighbourhood? - You know, one thing and another... - Stoli, double it! We don't serve mixed drinks. Mixed drinks! Never heard of stoli! Jesus! We got glasnost going on! Ah! Get educated! Get outta here! "No mixed drinks” means he don't serve no obnoxious white boys like yourself - son! Who you shovin'? I'm dangerous, man! Show you my piece. I don't pack it in public. Out in the car. You'll see! You're gonna hear about me! You're attracting a bad element here, Clyde. He likes his ass on the jukebox, that's all. Where Lester at, in the back? He duckin' the man. Your guess as good as mine. Goddammit! Hey! Your machine ate my quarter! All right. All right. I'll give you your money back. Hey Sheila, it's dekker. - Hold on... - Ah, sh... Just a second! Sheila, why don't you open the door... Come on, open the door. Damn it... I'm tired of this shit! Come in... Look, I don't wanna go through this chain thing again here. Sheila, I don't wanna play this game, all right? Open the door. Not a word about my outfit? You know, the tenants' meeting is not gonna last all night. We gotta get with it. Let's go. Close the door. Not everyone's at the tenants'... oh ...! Watch out! Oh, no, no, no... not yet! You're tearing my bustier! I don't think you appreciate me fully... Shut up. = damned boots! They only had an 8 and a half. We oughta have our heads examined. Wide open here. Yeah... Sheila and [weren't exactly what you would call lovebirds. You know what I'm saying? Fuck you, dekker. Bless you! [T's a great night, huh? Hello, if you leave your name and phone number, your call will be returned as soon as possible. Hiya, buddy! It's me! I guess you're asleep... Resting up for tomorrow, huh? To be- - Oh, yeah... What the ...? Hey, monster! What're you doing in there? Gimme a heart attack! Hey! Ow! My arm! Leave me alone! I was having a good time! Ow! My arm! Just leave me alone. What's wrong with your arm? I ain't bothering no one. I'm just playing. Ball is playing. Shooting hoops with the other kids, that's playing. Hey, jetman, ciggy-butt on ya? I gave 'em up. How are you gonna grow up smokin'? Oh, save it. That line is printed on every pack. Read this on the bottle for me, will ya? What, your eyes quit on you or somethin'? It says: "Fill cap to line for normal loads.” Gotta be a hat to read in this light. Batman, what did you do? You crawled in there to pull on your pud? Oh, shut up! Fddie... Show me. [T ain't nothing! If it's nothing, you can show me. Show me. Come here. Hey, hey. Easy. Oh, man... Who did this to you? I fell... Honest. It wasn't the old man this time. I'm gonna take him out. Don't go! He didn't mean to! You don't want to get mixed up in this! Social workers... We'll call the cops. =- you don't understand... He's all I've got. That's how it is. Hey! Hey... hey... uh... Hey, suck on one of these... Gimme a ciggy-butt any day. You owe me both. Hey, I show you this scar? Fine... Uh-huh... Okay. Thank you. Very good... Mr., uh ...? The name was? Oh, wow... Uh, zidzyck. Could you please not play with that? Please? Thank you. Okay. Very good! No indication of cataracts, glaucoma... Very good! Doc ...? Doc! I'm seeing double, here. The mydriacyl the nurse put in to dilate your pupils... Your vision will be affected temporarily. Did you drive to the office? I could arrange for someone to... I got important things to take care of. How temporarily are talking about, doc? Could you put something in them, give me my eyes back? No, I'm sorry, there's nothing I can put in them. Doc... I get my eyes back tonight? Absolutely. Of course, Mr., uh... zidzyck? Zidzak? The nurse should've explained it to you... Doctor wyle? = nurse! Yes? Oh, it was killing me. My eyes are going... And the fucking doctor made it worse - as usual. Maybe it was fate telling me to take the night off. Let this Mrs. zidzyck wake up tomorrow. Yeah. - Hello? - Koenig. Hey! Tonight... I dunno, man! Hal ha! You... You're kidding me, right? = uh. No. Goddamn eyes! Goddamn optometrist. I can't see shit. You can't see shit is why you went. I'm gonna sue his ass. Puttin' these drops in my eyes... And this guy, zidzyck, Zane, whatever .. You gotta tell him. Who is this prick who wants to see a baby get blasted? Since when have you had personal opinions? Even if I get my eyes back, I need a break! A day or two, what's the difference? Look, all the times I fronted you, I staked you, and now you're gonna play prima Donna on me? I don't understand! What do you want, to get my ass burned? Okay, fine, fine. Don't get yourself out of whack. Hey, I sent you a little present. You know, plain brown wrapper. I hope I got the size right. Just keep your appointment and use your new toy. Whatever. Yeah, yeah. See, no problem. I'm counting on youl. Yeah. But I'm tolling you, nun! I wanna sue this optometrist! This is a crazy day. There I was you know, I thought to myself... If the world would just stay like this, (wouldn't have to do nothing. Now that would be a real vacation. Hey, whoa! Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey! Freeze, punk! This was the last person I wanted to see. Jake cooley. Fucking optimist! I ask you, back in lunenburg, who'd've thunk we'd be on the outside this soon enjoying the fruits of free enterprise. Why not? We spent the dime, we did the time. Hey! Watch it! Be careful. Things are going great for me! Hey, look at these photos. My little boy. Has he grown, huh? This here's the new place. Cooley's pizza paradise. Cooley's got a wife and a kid. That's nice. Guess he really pulls it together okay. Okay, so, fine, he's got a crumby pizzeria franchise, but he's got his act together. I gotta get home, I got business. So you movin' lots some oldsmobiles? Porsches! How many times do I gotta tell you? I'm a Porsche dealer! It confuses me! 'Cause you drive a olds! This guy wants to be my buddy. But you know, I mean, I don't have buddies. Anyway, what was I gonna do? Discuss the old days over a pie with anchovies? I gotta get a hold of my life, get my package, do the job, close on my co-op, and get out of the business. Just the man I'm looking for. Package from Mr. koenig. = I'll be over at the paradise. Koenig's gift of technology. Your up-to-the-moment hitman device, shooter, bumper-offer keep-it-quiet toy. Now, goddamn sleep, jockey. Hey, dekker! Hey, it's your old pal shandy! You know, like "the shandyman can"? Hey come on, get in the car! Whoa! Dekker, I need new brakes. Oh, man, this car just has a mind of its own. It's a monster! I can't control it! Oh! Ah, there, I got it. Parallel park! Hey, can't do it! Here, grab the door. No! Wait! There. - Hey, shandy, what's going on? - Put that up here. Put it up here. Hey, you meet piccolo? Hey, you know who I miss? I sincerely mean this. Sammy. Singer, dancer. Bojangles, bojangles... What a talent. Now that's an all-around entertainer, Sammy was. He left a real void. Um, I'm gonna get on outta here, I got some business. =- hold it. What's your vote, pic? Pat him down? Cuff him? Take him down to headquarters? Confiscate his tool box? Huh? Piccolo is in his best. And now, for kdka sports, good news for steelers fans. = oh shit! Pittsburg 13, Miami 7 ball scores! Huh? How about that? How about that, pic? Steelers by 6! I had 'em. Point spread and everything! Spread my cherry hole you did! Spread your cherry hole I didn't! You work security at the an museum lately? I was working there last spring, in April. April, hey? Let's see... There seems to be missing a... Bronze vessel, late zhou dynasty. I think they said it's pronounced "Joe". Joe, zhou... What's the difference, huh? Fourth century b.C. That's third century... Ah, give or take... You know these cases? Nine out of ten times, it was a security guard who did it. Why is that, pic? Because nine times out of ten, security learn skills in the joint. Got that right. Yeah. Security, they're either ex-offenders... Or ex-copss. You packin®' up bronze dust? That ain't no little bronze vessel in my pocket, shandy. I'm just happy to see you. Get your face out of here. Will ya? Get outta here! I don't wanna see your face! I'll explain it to pic! You see, he's not packing a bronze vessel he's just happy to see me! You dickhead! Ba-boom! A bronze vessel? I just took it because I wanted it! I don't have any good reason! And he knows... He knows everything about me. Who I really am. I'm dying. A professional without coffin. That's death! I'm telling you he had me! I was a dead man! Dekker, don't fall apart on me! You got a pop to do! = shit! That asshole! Dekker, there's something else zidzyck wants! A birthday present. Proof you did the work. Who's this guy think he's dealing with!? He's insisting you bring back a piece of her. A piece of her? He's a sick son of a bitch! You fucking better do this! = I'll do it! I'l do it... It was just like he described it: A tomb. You know what's funny? I was all better. My eyes would cooperate. I'd almost cooperate. It was just me and me. Nothing personal. Purely business. She's ask me why, they always did, she'd know why... They always do. Come on up and join the party! Oh, shit... Happy birthday, al! = oh, shit! Ah! What? Did you put your eye out? I thought you were my husband. It's his birthday. That's why I didn't. I didn't ask who it was. Do I look like your husband?! Do I look like your husband?! TV guy? Where is the goddamned TV here?! Um... look, I feel so terrible for shooting you like that. I won't mind if you just want to walk out the door and leave. I got an appointment. I'll keep my appointment. Gee, you guys keep late hours, huh? Well, there's the patient. Ta-dah! It keeps me company. What a mess. I can't even watch any my favorites. It was working fine until al took it apart. That's when it went ka-blooie! All right, all right, baby! I'm having one of those days... Here I come, baby! Hold on, sweetie! You are so big and strong. I can take care of you. I love you. What a mess... Excuse me. = that little hum, does that mean there' hope or no hope? Gasp! My roast! Oh god! Can you hold him for one second? Please? No, no! Shit! Oh, it's totally smoking! I can't believe I did this! I should've known that I'd... Burn it and mess it up! I turned this stove off no, it's gonna be okay... A little done on the outside but the inside is nice and pink... Okay. Oh, it's okay. Oh yes, there we go. That small and poor baby. It's okay, Billy. I'm going to let you stay here. Look at the bears, baby, I'll be right back. He's fine. He's okay now. How're you doing? Oh god! No! No! Al? Al... Jain! Open your mouth... I got my key stuck! Jainy! I'm gonna kill you all. Promise. Jainy! Jainy, honey, it's your sister! It's kiki, open the door! I'm coming. Jainy, it's kiki! Jainy! There! What are you gonna do? Make me stand out there all night? Like this wasn't enough! = kiki... I can't believe this! I was at the grand union over at belmont and I walked out and there was these three guys... I need some water, I just... = I'll get it for you! No, it's not for me, it's for the coat. They spraypainted all over my coat! The baby... A bullit's so quick, jain. Get rid of her. Look at this place... Jain, this is a mess. Jain, what ...? Hey, leave those on, they look great! What's with the cooking, anyway? It's al's birthday. Well honey, in the future, cater. Look, I'm sorry I didn't bring your last minute shopping. It's just that when those goons attacked me, I dropped everything and ran. I don't know why the store won't deliver your groceries anyway. Yeah, they cut off the credit, there's some mixup. I'll speak to al. - Mrs. zidzyck. - Ah! That screwdriver I asked you for... Yeah, I'll be right with you, okay? It's the TV repairman! I really need to help him, kiki! = that's the blind leading the blind... Tacky! And on al's birthday. Although I personally cast no stones. I found it. You look terrible. You should get out more. Truth is, you don't get out at all. Honey, how am I supposed to go to Vegas and leave you like this? It's just that... well, the pay in Vegas is so tempting. Wait 'til they see the only unsiliconed set on the strip. Kiki, I think he needs to work on the TV! Mighty big toolbox not to hold a screwdriver. I'm pretty well equipped. = I'll bet. Kiki, if I'm gonna surprise al, you gotta go, now. Okay? You gotta go. =jaine... Jaine, people don't live like this. Ask the man. What do you think, Mr. repairman? I mean... He's obviously too flabbergasted for words. Just take a look at this place. Where she comes up with these harebrained schemes... On TV, you know that. Like she could tackle a major construction job like this on her own. The idea is that we do it together, me and al. Like al would really dirty his hands. - Mrs. zidzyck... - That darned al... I think I left something in the back room. I'll go get... I'll get it in one second, the baby's sleeping. Look over here, look. We turned over to one home improvement tape. I swear she keeps the home shopping club in business. That's not fair, kiki. Get her outta here. Jain, honey. How long do you intend to stare at these paint samples? Since they were suggested, I decided to live with them. He didn't mean for ever. All hideous, I might add. I prefer the color they sprayed my coat with. Ah... I just love this coat. It was my favorite leopard. Should I call the cops? I wonder. If 1 call right now, they're probably still in the neighborhood. = don't bother... Yeah. And then they make me wait and hang around for weeks of line-up and shit and there goes Vegas! You're right. Thank you. I've got something... For Billy. Billy, sweetie! I... Hey! Uh What? We had a really hard time putting the little kid to sleep. Yeah, he's real cranky. Thank you. Well... I don't need a ton of bricks to fall on my head. I'm grabbing your style. Wow. Can I have a hug? =yeah. I'll call you when I get to Vegas, okay? Okay. Tonight. - Yeah. Who are these killjoy creeps to tell me fur is no fun? Hmm? Bye-bye! - You expecting any more company? - Al, any minute. Yeah, well, we'll leave al aside for the time being. Who else has the key to your place? Kiki. Well, she won't be back. But she acts suspicious. But you frosted her. = no! She's a dancer! Look, why don't you take whatever's valuable and go! Why do you attack me and my baby? Do you know my husband? Do you know my husband? Who are you? Look, you don't need a gun. You don't need a gun, there's no other tenants, here! Al got this really good deal. The construction company went bust. It's a ghost town. Hey! You know I won't risk the baby! If you touch my baby, I'll kill you! I just wish al was here, that's all! One thing to bully a woman alone in a house with a child, but he cut you down to size! I told you, I'm expecting him any time now! = don't count on it. A man does not miss his own birthday. Ah, man... How many times he been here, this month? Once. To mess with the TV, so the repairman could get in! What do you know about it? I'm married to him! Don't you get it? I'm your divorce! Your husband hired me to kill you. = no. Not all that's crazy, that's crazy! We'll be celebrating our fourth anniversary this summer. = that's all she wrote. I was 16 years, this big time cruising in the school yard in a silver BMW. All the school girls were just gaga over him. But it was me. I was the one he was after. Let me call him! It's a misunderstanding. On your part, it looks like. No! No! He has a bad temper but he cools up! He loves me! He loves you not. This isn't happening. It's about the baby, is that it? God, in his head it's not his baby... you go in there, look in that baby's face, you'll see it's al's baby! No, don't! He usually wakes up al and then... I have to watch my step around you. Nothing is gonna affect the outcome, Mrs. zidzyck. = it's jain. I don't care what your goddamned name is! It's just Mrs. zidzyck sounds... It's jain! Like rain, j-a-i-n. When al gets pissed off, he sings in my ear: "Jain, jain, go away come again some other day." What's yours? This gun... Has a name. Smith &wesson. Stainless steel, satin finish. Sleek. - No, please. - It's not my idea. = no. Nothing can beat a .38 special at close range. No, please... That's big al! = kiki! No, it's big al! He's checking up on me! No, kiki she got downstairs, went to the first phone. She knew you weren't my boyfriend, ha! You stepped out for a second. Can I answer before it wakes the baby? You got a phone in the can? =no. That's where you are. You're in the shower. You got shampoo in your ears. = she'll call back. You went to a movie. Big al was a no-show, so you took the baby. - I don't go out. - Kikl'll figure you did. - She knows I don't. - So what? Do I have to repeat it? I don't go out. I don't go out! Ah! Big al... Big al... I bet your money that's big al! Answer this bastard! He couldn't wait half an hour! The son of a bitch is always breathing down my neck! Between you and me, your husband... Is a pain in the ass.

I saw his business card. Commodities. No, al's a furrier. He took over for his dad. Not that I have anything to show for it in my closet. Fur's a business to al, though, you know. Shady business, mostly. Hijacked off trucks and shit like that. But Mr. al zidzyck wouldn't last long in the stock exchange with the tales I could tell, you know? On his business card, it says Albert Zain. Albert Zain? He's so screwed up! Well, I guess that makes you jain Zain! = jain Zain! That's worse than zidzyck! Poor al's cake... Poor al's cake!

You like dusty Rose? All day, I couldn't make up my mind. Turns out al didn't care. He's always screwed around. Girls galore. Maybe somebody else would be more appreciative. You have to do me up. Hands are warm. Al's are clammy. I never noticed that before. He wears clear nail Polish. Did you see that? I'm gonna go with you when you tell him to his face, right to his face what he can do with his contract. = jain... I mean, can you believe a man would do that to his wife? See him for the bastard he really is, huh? Serves him right, what's going on here. Serves him... What's wrong with you? It runs in the family, you and that sister of yours? You want me to, you know you do! You're a whore. You do it with anybody! No, I am not. You wouldn't put me through all this if there was no hope, would you? =- damn... There .. Is Ho... hope. You got a house falling down around you, and a husband that wants you dead. You got a sister... That is fucking... Your husband that wants you dead. There is no hope, jain. I promise youl. Kj=== kiki... Kiki, oh god... How many did you swallow? None, kiki gave them to me. You're all alone poppin' pills, watching a scrambled TV screen and pretty paint streaks on the wall, pink and purple... Look at you, dressing up like a baby doll, a wind-up toy! = kiki wouldn't do that to me. She can have anybody. A fistful of "trangs™ ain't gonna put it out your mind. Guess zidzyck was right about you. Who are you to judge me? I'm fighting for my life!!! I'll kill you bastard! I'll kill you! Kill you! I'll kill you! Hey... let me show you. Let me show you what this is all about. This is your picture... That's the instructions. That's $20,000. Twenty thousand... for me... It's only half. I got another 20 calling to me. I don't deserve this. I'm not a whore. You coming onto me with the kid in the next room? You're your own worst withess! To save my baby! $40,000... You think that's a lot? You think that's a little bit? For al, it's high. Jain? $40,000... Pays for you. And it pays for your baby. No, not my baby. You kill me. Kill me! Me! You hear me?! He's a crack baby! I'm doing him and you a favor! He is a healthy baby, I kicked cold Turkey, everything. I made him healthy! You keep lying to me! How am I supposed to believe you? It's the truth! No, I made up one lie: Me and Mary-Helen, we didn't make cheerleader. Mary-Helen was so great, her dream was to be a nurse. Mine was... god... To be married. = jain... This is rough. When you and kiki were in the kitchen... I gotta... I gotta remember: Three-hundred degrees, twenty-two to twenty-five minutes per pound, gotta remember. Gotta remember, gotta remember. The baby's gone... Why? I got... l got... Jain, don't go in there! It's gonna hurt you! Tell al this time I had the final say so! = don't! - That's a... - My baby... A pretty dirty trick I played.

The fuck you're controllin' this! I can do this! This is who I am! We are the wild cats and we couldn't be prouder and if you don't believe it we'll shout a little louder shut up! We are the wild cats and we couldn't be prouder and if you don't believe it we'll shout a little louder! We are the wild cats and we couldn't be prouder and if you don't believe it we'll shout a little louder we are the wild cats we couldn't be prouder and if you don't believe it we'll shout a little louder we are the wild cats "Nothing personal. Purely business.” Who am I kidding? Of course it's personal! It's goddamned personal to them! It's all personal! The way I was shaken up, the way she had my number, the way she and I saw through each other... I'm a pro, this is who I am! No, it isn't. No! But then who am I? I gotta know. Good night. Doc... I gotta talk to you, doc. Uh... I gotta have a session, I gotta talk to you now. Uh... mister ...? = dekker. Mr. dekker, this is my home, I'm entertaining guests. Who is it? I dunno where else to go. See there's all these people... I blew away. I can't even remember their names. I have done... So many horrible things. How are you doin"? Raymond, should we ...? No, it's all right. Mr. dekker... You have violated my home. We do not have a professional relationship. And if what you have told me tonight is in fact the truth... I may very well have to call the authorities. I just came here to ask you... How am I supposed to live? =I don't know. How? I don't know who you are. I gotta go. Hello. If you leave your name and phone number, your call will be returned as soon as possible. Hello, are you there, dekker? It's your friend Jesus. You know, your current employer. Koenig told you we're at 210 east Liberty. Ask for me, I'll be in the back. I'll show you my real church. Don't you want your co-op down payment? Come and get it! You're an owner! I'm not a happy individual, dekker, you know I feel I'm gonna be very upset! Tick-took, tick-took... It's coming up on 9:53, two hours overdue. You owe me an explanation. Get here, I'm waiting. Plus, you don't care about the 20 I got in a case, here. You know, I got a good mind to burn a bill for every minute you keep me waiting, how's that? What are you doing? Sitting and screening your calls enjoying yourself, while I got this hook in my goddamned guts? You know, I feel I'm gonna be very upset! Well, nobody diddles me. I expect closure on this to the letter of our agreement. We're not finished. Come on! Come on, it's Eddie from the seventh floor! What? Bob, you know what's going on? Did you get my message? I had the worst scene with my husband. Dekker, he knows! = shush! Is eddy hurt? The boy stabbed his father. A butcher's knife straight through the heart. Carried him out in a body bag. Eddie! Uh-huh! You're coming with me! This way. And there you were, your gun in my ribs. I couldn't help the kid again. Ah, here we are! We'll take your car. And you'll drive. Time weighing heavy, dekker. You and me, we've entitled a lot of years. I played the gig. I got his proof right here. =I don't need to see it. That's good, though. It's worth $20,000 to you. That's my commission. Okay. Zidzyck... He's poison. He's the client, dekker. I knew you'd come around. It's gonna be just like old times. Thanks. - Sure, boss. He's risen! No chair to offer you, but it's a room with a view. It's a one-way glass. She's performing in front of a mirror. Guys are watching her on five sides. Pentagon! Here's your twenty. All yours, once you reassure me. Got my work? You know, I'm convinced that jain was destined to suicide in time. You promised me proof. That's funny. You know, I had a whole different take on jain. You're... you're calling her "jain" all of a sudden. J=a=1=-n. Rhymes with rain. “Jain, jain, go away ..." You spoke? She cursed you up and down. You told her it was me? She put 2 and 2 together. She's smart, jain. I never dreamed my name would come into this, I wonder how comfortable I am with that. Intimate contact wasn't the deal with jain. This is intimate here in my hand. You're so anxious to get this. I'm satisfied, I can see it. I worked so hard to get it, I mean, don't you want to take a little peek at that? I don't want it! I don't want it! Did you wanna know the details? I mean, after your long wait... How it felt to pump one into her brain? Jain's brain ...? Go away, come again... I'm tired of this. Just take your money. Look here, this is a new experience for me. I mean, try to imagine how it felt to pump one into this... The destruction, the damage... In this soft skull. I don't wanna hear this, okay? How did you know I was the guy for this job? I mean, when you first saw me, under the painting of the holy virgin, you said to yourself then: "That's my baby killer"? Now, maybe I was right about you. When you were so late, I used another contact. Fellas, how long is this gonna take, for Christ's sake? =I don't stand still! I hired a third party to check out the situation! Fuck you, you did! Look, the boy's obviously unstable. Ought to be there any moment! = you motherfucker! No, don't shoot! I quit! Why don't you take your money, your down payment, and go home. Zidzyck's dead. Zidzyck? = Zain. Albert Zain. Zain, huh? Kind of a tall guy, little heady brown eyes, big deal on the stock exchange? Yeah. I killed him. Oh, shit! Yeah. Clyde... Why don't you be nice to the guy? The next time you order stoli, say "please." You see? I told you you'd hear about me. Is he really dead? Yeah. I'm getting our stuff together, we're getting out of here. Yeah. = I'm scared. =I know. Hey! Yeah? You gotta help us get out of here. We need you. Took 'em to see that guy I told you about with the pizzeria. His family loved her. Changed like a kid, koenig. You know what I mean? A woman and a kid, all at the same time! I had to get her out of town. But I had one piece of unfinished business first. You asshole! Shandy never knew about the garage! That was you keeping me in line, wasn't it? He just wanted his bronze vessel - Joe, zhou, second, third, give or take... You know what it was? He wanted me to blast the baby. Not that I like babies... I like this baby. And jain. We changed each other. Stranger things have happened. Not that there could be anything with me and jain. I mean, never! Hell, I'm not stupid! Anyway... I'm leaving town. So I won't see you for a while, maybe never. But, uh... Someone, sometime. Someone like jain you know? Like rain, jain... Between my eyes, my arm, my goddamn troubles, the woman and baby lived. Maybe me too. Maybe not. The girl has a chance. So we'll both be sure that nothing happens to her. Otherwise, watch out. I'd like to say it was a pleasure talking to you, but... Since I'm really talking to your machine, then I guess I'm really talking to myself. All right, bye. =I can't believe it! She said she'd even pick me and the baby up at the station! Yeah, I thought Mary-Helen was the one we should call. It's really all gonna be okay, I know it. Mary-Helen, she's my best friend - still. She's a nurse, remember, I told you? Hi. One-way ticket to Denver, please. For me and the baby. First class, sleeper compartment. Compartment is $620. - I can't... - 1 got it. Hey... this is for you. Uh, no, I can't. This is yours! = oh. Wow it is, isn'tit? Crazy. Where are you going? = uh, it's better I don't tell you that. = I'd like to know. Excuse me? Excuse me. Gate e, compartment 7 train's already boarding. Okay, thank you. Thank you. Listen, you stay inside the compartment here. We can go to the dining room. Uh... no, you just tip the guy and the guy'll bring all the stuff to your room, you'll be out of sight. But we've never been on a train before. We really wanted to. You know, the police, they... They're not looking so hard for you, but they do want to ask you some questions. You're right, you should be able to... Go to the dining car. The dining car's nice. They got table linens and they got nice silverware. You just got to be careful. You don't talk to no strangers. I'm sorry. I'm very sorry. Will we ...? I mean, will we see each other sometime? I know it's crazy, but you saved us. Guess you can't come with us. Hide. Guess it'd be kind of obvious. Anyone walked in the room, they wouldn't have to ask which one is dekker. All aboard, please, for amtrak train... I gotta go. This is the final call. Thank you for travelling amtrak. Yeah, yeah we do. Here you go. - Oh, thanks. I hope I see you again sometime. Me too. All aboard, please, for amtrak train departing Pittsburgh at gate e. This is the final call. Thank you for travelling amtrak.
