What were all these people doing here today? Is she your daughter? What's your name? Didn't you say you quit smoking last year? Don't you want to talk? Not about smoking No about this Jalal I wish you'd ask my opinion -I told you what I wanted to do -You did but you didn't ask for my opinion I knew what you thought Then why did you talk about it? You could've not told me the car was found Suppose you never had it -You said that, didn't you? -That was when it was lost Why should you think you don't have it when it's found? Why should you think that? Do we seem very rich Jalal? -You can't pay the rent if they don't pay you for a month -Bita I'm not well Can you not say anything? It's not a little while, you've been unwell for 11 years Jalal he was my son too! You haven't been my husband nor a father to your other son for 11 years This is my certificate that's Morteza's name This is his photo He hasn't gone to court yet but the person in charge said It's around 30 million I swear Morteza didn't do anything wrong. My cousin attacked him He went to lift his head it hit my cousin's nose -Do you sleep here at night? -Yeah -But they said I only have until -Sir this place Place needs a caretaker they've asked someone to come on Tuesday Then what will you do? I don't know Sorry but have you chosen Morteza's wife? Yes -Thank God -Really? But there's only one thing I posted the ad for 30 million But I can only pay half of it -But they said around 30 -She's right We went to their house with my wife and father-in-law We went to talk to them but they didn't change their minds Money is their excuse they want her to leave him I promised half of this money to someone else -Thank you, it's still so nice of you -But they said they want 30 to let him go I know but to be honest I promised someone else This money wasn't there since the beginning Hopefully you'll make him change his mind with 15 Come to the office around 9 you have the address -Yes -Bye -Bye -Thank you Excuse me! I wanted to tell you something I'll be off I couldn't tell the other man I met yesterday I... I... I'm pregnant If Morteza doesn't come out I can't keep this baby What are you looking for? -Where is the gold? -What for? -I need them -You need them or you want to do some more charity? Why do you talk like that? I'll replace them -What use are they to you? -I said I'll– -Why do you argue with me? -Should I? You're giving your family's money away Wasn't the car enough? You were the only one using it! -Why do you keep bringing the car up Mitra? -Should I? When they took the car four months ago you said suppose you didn't have it. Didn't you? I was wrong, I wanted to calm you down Why do you act stupid Jalal? Think -What should I do? -What's all this? Why did you make a fool of yourself Sara's husband called saying why is Jalal doing this? You want to sell it, do that why the ad? You want to portray yourself as a hero? -If my wife says this what can I expect from others? -What should I think? -You never even asked my opinion -I told you as the first person You think I'm an idiot? You think I don't know what your problem is? I've lived 11 years with your problem Jalal Take a look at yourself it's as if the kid has died yesterday You think he'll get back if you do this? Look at what you did to your hand Why do you do this to yourself? How many times have we been over this? I swear my point isn't the car forget that Why do you do this to yourself? -You did everything you could back then too -I should have done more -If a human was out there, it would -There weren't any around -You believe in God, he decided it -He didn't! He didn't! When I was in need of 5 million no one was around To help me so my kid doesn't die in my arms He was too smal to know God He expected his dad to help him so he doesn't die I asked every single person for help even these papers Even these papers -Some animals -Drink this Drink this Let them all say what they want they think I'm stupid They want to say he's lost his mind? They're looking for a sane person? Here, here, here I posted an ad for my own problem Why do you I don't get it? I told you he was my baby too You're so mean Jalal Here, there's only this one The rest is in the bank But I swear this isn't the way Look at me It's 10 Why are you crying? I won't go if you say no Look at me -We'll wait half an hour more -Sure Did you see your aunt? Well... What happened? Did they say they'll change their mind with 15? What do they say? They say you either pay it all or you leave Morteza Did you cousin love you? When did your parents pass away? -In the Baam earthquake -Did you live in Baam? -Where? -Baravat Don't you want to wait more? No, she'd come if she wanted to -Can I ask something? -Sure Why do you do this? You think I'm wrong too? I don't know You'll be late
