Hello. Are you asleep? Rise and shine girl, there is some morning news. I can't believe it. How twisted the world is. I already noticed something when he bought the shotgun. Please, Mona. I'm like a tomb. I will keep the secret. Who am I going to tell? That's why you can't trust humble people. With that little face... It's revolting! And what does the prince say? Of course I won't tell anyone! I'm not even surprised, I feel sorry. Humanity is perverted, we live in a world of masochism. What a poor generation. Don't be dumb, I won't tell anyone. I know girl, I know. And she studied in a religious school too. How little conscience... Poor prince. Veronica honey, it's Cuqui. I've got some news! What news? You are killing me baby. Isn't it a pity? Serves him right. He's been a reveler. Always from one girl to the next. Tell me about it! I met him in Laredo, with his canoe and his fishes. He was there sunbathing and he flirted with me. So what? He was empty. - Like he is now. - Now he's worse. Good afternoon, lady. - Hi. - Hi, Veronica. What does the latest news say? He's already had four drinks. Why do they always have to drink? - It's a drug after all. - And a way to forget. Wow, nice dress! Made in Italy. It's no big deal. Oh, that must be expensive, doll. How ordinary. Luisito bought it for me. He's ordered the fifth drink! I'm going to calm him down. - I can't tell you any secrets. - Everyone in Madrid knows it. And if I let you, in a moment everyone in Barcelona and La Coruña too. - How are you prince? - Cuqui, dear. - Are you alone? - No, with the group. - Ciao dears. - Hi, prince. I didn't see you as I had my back to you. Prince, never turn your back on a lady. - Where's Pochola? - Shooting. Just a month after getting married? Don't be like an old lady, Sonsoles. She likes hunting and I like fishing. Married couples have to understand each other nowadays. And resign themselves. That as well. Year 2000 is getting close. Things change, why would marriage be any different? I pity those who can't see this. It's funny. Pochola is killing partridges and you are killing time. They are both killing something! Come on. Let's go! She doesn't get tired! Come on, Ms Pochola. It's going to rain! - Fine. - The others have already gone. Fantastic! Then the whole hunting ground is for me. Another one! Forward! - One shot, one bird. - In a war you'd be unstoppable! I only missed two shots, and you know why? - Because I thought of you, brute! - I swear I'm innocent. I know. Poor birds. When I shoot them I only think about the money. Now, I regret killing them. Yesterday they were flying happily - What are we going to do with them? - Send them to you friends. To my friends? Why? They think you weren't hunting, but with some boyfriend. And that I am a cuckold. Is that right? A gift from Ms Pochola. Take that out off my sight. She sent me another dozen. - It's her typical sense of humor. - And what's that nonsense? I'm sorry for those birds. This is only the cover, Carola. Three days is a lot of time. Luisito, leave that trash off. You can kill many birds with one shot. Even if there are plenty, the one that is missing is the most important. But if she kills that one, the "hunting" is over. Bye. - Prepare them but without pellets. - Sure, sir. - What are you going to do? - Eat them. You have no conscience! If you are so sad about them, write them an obituary for the newspapers. See if you like it. - What do you think? - Violent. If I wear that my husband starts barking. Your Pablo, Fonseca is so uptight. Amalia, what is the news from around the world? In the Iberic continent, a couple of skirmishes. - Agapito and Lola broke up. - I saw it coming. Cuqui wants to go to the Far East. Again? - She wants to see hunger up close. - But she's so skinny. Ms Sonsoles is calling you. - Tell her to wait a moment. - OK. She's made herself a new dress for church. - You're not coming? - Ah, no. So much time in church when Alejandrito is already dead. It's to thank him for leaving her so much money behind! And one mass doesn't hurt anyone. When the prince dies I won't do any mass or reminder. No matter how much money he leaves me. Men live to make money and die. The earlier the better too. - You make me shiver, Pochola. - But I'm right. Sonsoles is an introvert. The Alejandrito masses, who was a schizophrenic, are for her a party. And she cries in that way... And she wants us to cry. I don't cry for anything. No way! Have you seen her fancy dress? All black is very boring. It's been 3 years already. Already? Seems like only yesterday. I can remember him, with that oily color. What a temper he had. Deep down, Sonsoles is more relaxed now. He only liked eating and making money. - Just like Luisito. - But Luisito is healthy. Don't be so certain. I always tell him no to eat so much, but he is very rebellious. One day he's gonna give me a fright. Amen. This is ending and those two are not showing up. That's not nice. Because we are friends and if any of us needs support we have to give it to her. Tell me the truth, Veronica. You and the girls thought I was cheating with the prince. - You are terrible. - I'm sincere. I don't care if they think that. But I care if you do. - Don't smoke so much. - Why? I like smoking, drinking... I like life. - And hurting. - Hurting? - Hurting who? - Me. Why? You've not been the same for a while. - You hide things from me. - Don't be artificial. We've always been good friends. I've always loved you like a sister. More than a sister. I care about your matters as much as mine. We've shared many secrets and we've always been loyal. That's why it hurts that you lie to me now. - What do you want me to tell you!? - Everything. Nothing happened. The prince and I still have a good relationship. He loves me. I love him. And that's it! You sure? Why a man and a woman sharing a drink means having an affair in this country? It wasn't a drink, it was three days. So what? If I asked an officer for directions, would you think I'm flirting? - It's not the same. - Look... When the prince and I got married we made a pact. If either of us got bored some day, there would be a cordial breakup. Without drama or bad blood. That's fine to say, and if nothing happens the pact stands. But what about later? It's the best formula to avoid something from happening. And if something happens, let it happen. If I got tired of sleeping with a man, why should I sleep with him? I'm amazed by your extraordinary frivolity. Cosmos model. This is Carla, so daring in this model. Deliciously juvenile. It has black lace tights and a white cloth skirt... and vinyl ornaments. - Julita. - Yes? - Note number 4 for me. - Sure madam. That model will make me look like a little girl. - She will look horrible in that. - Don't you think? It will look amazing on you! You don't waste any time. I come here to buy, not to look pretty like others... You are really powerful. Coque Louge model. A sophisticated and charming outfit. Composed of a black velvet frock-coat and long coat with ornaments... Here they are those two! - Hi! - Hey. - Where have you been? - From the gynecologist. What did he say? That I shouldn't be careless. I can easily get pregnant. - So soon? - Does it surprise you? Marriage provides children, among other things. Oh sorry. I forgot you were still waiting for the bus. You got on while it was running. But the driver was worth it, wasn't he? An advice, darling. Try catching the bus early. The last ones come at dawn. Hurry up! Cuqui you are so cute! What did you put on your face? You want to know it, honey? My conscience is clear. Julita, number 7 as well, please. Dolomitas model. Youthful outfit with a very modern finish. Accompanied by an original hat and sunglasses. - Veronica. - What? - I just got an idea. - Good or bad? Daring. And you are in it as well. Pochola, you're scaring me. Julita, please. Lady Eloisa model. We don't know if it's better to describe the elegance and audacity of the model... or the perfect body that is needed to wear it. Either way, the harmony is perfect... What's the matter? You haven't said a thing. You are absent. - I'm preoccupied. - I can tell. Let it go. No. I don't want to bother you with my problems. That's what friends are for. It's something very delicate. You don't trust me. We can't talk here. I've known you for a long time. And I think about you everyday. I know it's still early to meet. That you haven't completely forgotten. But I need to write to you so you know that a man that is not happy... wishes to be. And will only be happy with you. Shocking and old-fashioned. - I like it. - I'd like it too if I was 15. - Any idea of who he is? - No. Think. It's probably a friend of your husband. Why do you say that? We are always chased by our husband's friends. Is it the first one? - The second one. - It isn't signed. I know. - I know it's not signed. - Couldn't be a joke? Why would it be? Why? Maybe a pimp trying to live at your expense. - I didn't call you to torment me. - Sorry. - But you have so much money. - Money, money! Is that all I have? Or is it that I am too old? Sonsoles, I want to help you. You don't know how hard it is to be locked here everyday... waiting for the phone to ring so you can take me to the movies or a restaurant. - Please. - I'm tired of you comforting me. Tired of having money and living alone. You sleep with your husband every night but... I spend them all alone in that bed... full of fear and distress. I need someone to take me away from this. Someone that makes me live again. That's why I like those letters. Because they gave me a bit of hope. I thought being a widow felt like a release. Like being lucky. You're wrong. No matter how little a man is worth... he's always a man. You spend all day outside. I never see you. - It's me who doesn't see you. - Because you don't want to. Pablo, let's not get started... And now this dinner... with Luisito. Who is insufferable. - He's your friend. - A friend you brought. And that fat woman... they stink of pig. - What was deodorant invented for? - I can tell them we're not coming. You would give me the party here... I can go alone. So you can skin me all night? No. I prefer to hear things at first hand. You have so many complexes. Because I don't play your game? Because I don't like your people? Those harpies who spend all day skinning everyone alive with their talking. - You don't know about friendship. - And what about you? Do you? Do you know what friendship is? There are no friends nowadays. I can count mine with my hand. And I wouldn't need more fingers. - Because you are an antisocial. - I'm a realist. Now we live in a platform and everyone wants to stay on top. The higher the better. They don't have their feet on the ground for fear of slipping. - It's a power struggle. - You chose the wrong profession. You should be preaching in a church. I don't like falsehood or hypocrisy. Having to laugh without desire. And telling that dinner is exquisite... even if I'm bursting. Dinner was exquisite. The piglet was delicious. And what about the crabs? I've eaten so many they are tickling inside. - Stop it, stop it. - Don't be stupid. Preacher. Another drink? Thanks, Luisito. I've had enough. You didn't like the piglet? How come? I even had seconds. For you prince. You are one of mine. I always thought you were a real prince. Chus said you were a bit illiterate... Many believe I am. Even I believe it sometimes. It's because you look so important. Look man, we call him prince... because his father named him Igor. As it was '36 and the Russians were close... Olé. You have great hands for flamenco. Did you see how great she is? Long live blood and Galicia. - You are from Ponferrada, though. - Can't you say it any louder? - Why do you stop? - I don't know any more. - That's all the gypsy taught you? - I've only taken 20 classes. Let me. Come on, come on. What about the widow? You are very quiet. Luisito, don't be impertinent! But she is very serious. Natalia too. And I like happiness. Cheer up. When are you going to get married? You're always alone! There are no men, Luisito. No real men. - She doesn't have a boyfriend. - Olé. The party must continue! So typical of you, Pochola. - Any news? - No. You will get another one. Don't worry. I'm not worried. - What's this about? - I don't know. Other times... Laredo... Natalia, why don't you live in the present? Tell that to Pochola. You don't like her, do you? Why? She's my friend. I don't hold a grudge against her. She took what I didn't want. Then, why do you kiss me? Maybe, I was in the mood. However... You're not the same anymore, prince. You think so? I'll take the ice. This stain doesn't disappear! - It's not important... - Don't worry you two... ...that goes with talcum powder. - It's nothing really... - I like cleaning stains. Luisito makes me sick. And what about Cuqui? She imagines an adultery just to excite everyone. - What a night. - Do you like the idea? - I adore it! You and me... - Alone! - Without men. - That would be nice. But what will the preacher say? No. I refuse. And if I ignore you? I'll be sorry for you. What's wrong with me and Pochola going on a trip? I don't like Pochola. And even less that trip with you two alone. Pablo, I'm going to Rome whether you like it or not. Pochola got a meeting with the Pope... ...and I won't refuse only because you don't like it. What do you two care about the Pope? A lot. I want to have his blessing. I'll get the Pope's signed portrait and hang it here like everyone. That's what you want... His portrait. So everyone can see it. Pure vanity. Not faith. Just like Sunday's mass. You go just for appearance. 45 minutes go by fast. But there's enough time to see each other... ...to show off. To pay attention to everything. Except God. A few exceptions aside, you all go to church for the same thing... ...just because it's Sunday. And you are among those exceptions, always bragging about being a Catholic. - Are you really? - More than you and your people. You sin all week and believe that with the weekly mass everything is fixed. So you can start all over again. I know you love theology, but I don't. Besides, it's 4:00 and I'm sleepy. Good night. Veronica. How are you really like? And you Pablo. How are you really like? I detest the preacher. With his bitter face. He thinks he's important. - He's got two degrees. - Bullshit is what he's got. She's different, though. But... - Pochola is really nice. - She's just the same. - Nobody is nice for you. - If you saw and heard what I have... If I told you what I saw in the kitchen... - Natalia was looking at you all night. - Are you jealous? That's no real competition. And if you take her bait, it'll be worse for you. With Natalia? Come on... Here he was, eating seeds like a bird. I could have squashed him like this. But it wasn't worth it. I let Pochola do it. You like the prince. I can tell. I like to play. But believe me Sonsoles, no man is worth the trouble. Then again, we can't live without them. I can, and you do too. - Do you think I'm happy? - More than any of us. Some years of marriage... ...some trouble and then a fast heart attack. And freedom. Lots of money, as well. - Anyone would envy you. - Nonsense. How can you speak like that? Ciao, darling. - Don't go yet. It's early. - It's already 5:00. Have another drink. Are you scared of being alone? - No, it's not like that... - Have a good night sleep. The best thing about the dead is that they don't come back. What's up Sonsoles? Another card? For real? No, but we have a date! - That's amazing. When? - This afternoon, at 4:00. What do I do Veronica? What do I do? Dissipate all doubts by seeing his face. Even if it's just for curiosity's sake. Sonsoles. I thought you wouldn't come. I wasn't very sure about this. But I was curious... - I don't know. It's all so weird. - Not for me. I've been waiting and dreaming... ...for this moment a long time. 10 years ago... ...Alejandro and I flipped a coin to see who would get you. I lost. I didn't care about it, because I thought you wouldn't last. You were so different. But you got married. I went to the wedding. You looked so pretty. Shortly after that I went abroad. I considered myself a failure. About you... ...and other things. Time erases everything. A couple of months ago I came back. I learned about his death and... ...you appeared before me. You. Again. Like a fireball. - So you wrote the first letter. - That's right. Why didn't you sign them? My name wouldn't have meant anything. You didn't know me. But I... I still remember you. You were such a nice girl. Fun and cheerful. - I've changed a lot, haven't I? - Yes. Now you are a great lady. And you have a strange beauty that makes you even more attractive than before. I must say I'm impressed. What are you thinking? I'm trying to find you, but I can't seem to place you. I told you, you don't know me. Alejandro didn't want to introduce us. I don't understand why. He was scared that I told you how it all began. Well... You know it now. Now you can forget it. If you want I'll never bother you again. This can all end here. I have the picture of Pope John XXIII. He was a saint. It was an unforgettable meeting. In Castel Gandolfo. It was pouring! When he blessed us, I started crying like a fool. The emotion... - Don't cry now. - You'll cry too. Even if you don't like crying, you will. It's so impressive. - They are inside there. - Oh, thank you. Hello. - What's up girls? - Hi. So pretty. Hi, Sonsoles. Why do you cry Cuqui? Did you know Veronica and Pochola are going to Rome? To see the Pope. Yesterday I'd have gone with you. - Why don't you come? - Right? I'd be good for you. Italians are so... latinos. How do you know that? Chus is from Guadalajara. - Your usual tea? - No, bring me some champagne. - What's that about!? - You are too happy... - Hydroelectric companies went up. - Nonsense. I'm the same as usual. - You met him, right? - Indeed. He's a friend of Alejandro. - I never miss. - So touching... - Do I know him? - No. - What are you talking about? - Eh? - You're like two old ladies. - Italy, of course! Those two understand each other too well. - And that's fishy! - Cuqui, don't be so uptight. Going alone, like two foreigners... ...leaving their husbands here. If I left Luisito alone, he would die. Cuqui doesn't even go to church alone. It's been the same for 20 years. Well. I leave you two here. I'm going inside for a car meeting. Ciao, Pablito. I can't stand him. - He makes me sick to my stomach. - He's like that... Do you know something? Nothing. It worries me. Why? You have to give them some freedom. They love you more afterwards. You met not that long ago, so that might work... ...but we go way back, and it's not the same anymore. I don't get what you mean, but I'll tell you something... ...when they come back... ...let's go you and I on a trip and then we're even. Are you scared of him? Pablo is capable of following us. I get the impression he's watching us everywhere we go. So what? We're not doing anything wrong. For him, this is wrong. Does he love you that much? I don't know. And do you love him? - I did when we got married. - And now? Now it's different. Love turns into affection, then into a habit, monotony... We respect each other so much... ...that we could use honorifics. Love inside a marriage is very difficult. I'm not very experienced but, I try to go along with it. I'd get tired otherwise. The prince is crazy for you. And you don't make it easy for him. The prince is a cute boy... ...but too spoiled. Easy life, lots of money. A womanizer. He needed a woman like me. - Are you sure about your dominance? - Completely. Tell me something. Did you marry him for love or money? Both things. The prince is an easy and faithful husband. As you like it. What are you looking at? Poor him who wants to know what you have inside that brain. Poor her who trust men. That's why you're still single. Look at you. You forget you are married the first chance you have. What do you want me to do? I'm a man. Does that give you the right to cheat on your wife? You see? You don't love her. Do you think I don't love her anymore because of this ? Of course. If you loved her, you wouldn't do this. Or leave her go abroad alone. - She went with Veronica. - That's worse. Natalia... ...I don't know what you want, but whatever it is, this stays here. My wife is my wife. And you are... an affair. One night. One old friend. Don't be absurd. You are weak. You've done it once, you'll do it again. Because you have no integrity at all, prince! - This is wonderful. - Ladies... Again? Why so many photos? He must have taken us for princesses. I'll fix this right now. Look at these photos! - I've never got one like these. - Let me see. You are gorgeous. What does he say? He got us into the Lady Winter pageant. That's why you were chasing us. Naughty boy! It's funny. Lady Winter Holiday. It's wonderful. Pochola, don't count on me for this. I don't like this at all. It's not fun. - It is for me. - I'm leaving. Wait. Don't be ridiculous. Thank you, paparazzi. Pochola Serrano, a Spaniard has been crowned Lady Winter Holiday in Cortina d'Ampezzo. Another Spaniard, the wife of reputable industrial Don Pablo Fonseca was awarded Maid of Honor along with Patty Pearson from Ireland. Many beautiful girls reunited in the matchless Cortina d'Ampezzo pageant have been outmatched by our girls a new triumph for Spanish women. Carola, turn on your TV. Channel 1. You are going to die. I can't believe it Cuqui. This is huge. Here we see her kissing a carabinieri. Pochola. Shameless. Front page. I didn't know the Pope was in Cortina d'Ampezzo... - This Pope travels a lot... - Don't be a fool. What's wrong about her going to Cortina? She did good. She loves snow. What about this? A little foolishness that amuses me. It should embarrass you. Don't you see? - Me? Why? - You are a joke of a husband. Your friends must be enjoying the situation. - You too, right? - It makes me laugh. It hurts me that she is fooling you. After marrying you all she wanted is attention. To exhibit herself like a stupid and show off. I love her like this. With all her little jokes. Her frivolity. It's precisely what attracts me about her. I don't know if you are: a fool, insensitive or a cynic. Pablo. - Hi, Natalia. - Sit down. No, you two are talking... Sit down, I was about to leave. You should be proud, right? Natalia, I've always liked you. Don't force me to hate you. But it's been a triumph! A little far from the Vatican but it was worth it. They are so gorgeous. They are the girls of the day. Arrivederci, lucky boys. Why do people enjoy the misery of others? Because they suffer with their own. Envy. Natalia would have loved to be here. - This makes me sick. It's embarrassing. - Don't suffer. Take it like me. I can't. Do you know how many people has congratulated me? My own employees, the guards, the people here... Even the parking attendant. Congratulations my friends! You are the best. Have you seen the TV or read the newspapers? They only talk about your wives. It's great publicity for you. Announcing my preserved food cost me 1000$ a second. Fonseca this, Fonseca that. Even the stock market felt it! You're a lucky man! That's enough, Luisito. I hate jokes. What's that all about? What's wrong with him? - What do you think? - Might be his ulcer. Why doesn't he get surgery and change that mood? Hey, if my wife went to Cortina d'Ampezzo instead of bringing me a crown, she would come with a broken leg. Alright. I'm not going to argue. But I should say that thanks to your audacity, I've become the news man. The target of all gazes and comments. - At least the monotony is over. - No. Something more important broke. Something we've been silently breaking during the last few years. - Where are you going with this? - We've already gone. Let's not fool each other. We've been living with our backs turned for a while. We're together only because we have to be together. But not because of love. We lost love foolishly. I don't know if it was you fault or mine. - Let's say that a bit of both. - Pablo, I hate your lectures. I know that the trip and all of this has been absurd. But let's not be dramatic. After all, what has happened? So, finish talking, but put it bluntly. Alright. We don't understand each other. And when a man and a woman don't understand each other The best thing is to end it. Divorce. - Say goodbye. - If you want it, I won't say no. But destroying eight years of marriage just like that is very selfish of you. I know I haven't been good to you lately. I haven't been the wife you dreamed of. But you've also forgotten that I have feelings. And just like you missed a woman, I've also missed a man. A man? Did you ever need a man? I thought your friends were enough. Especially Pochola. The intimate friends, people call you. What do you mean? She's your shoulder to cry, your solace. She will take you wherever she wants because she manipulates you. Yes, because she understands me. She's always had for me that encouragement you never gave me. So, blame yourself. You are to blame. Because you never knew your place. Suit yourself. You're the victim and I'm the executioner. A harmless executioner. Incapable of hurting anyone. That's always been there for you. And even if you don't believe it. I never stopped loving you. Did you take your freedom well? Or are we going to argue? I like that you don't follow any trend. That you do what you want. I trust you and I congratulate you. See? This is what a gentleman's reaction looks like. I love you prince. And even if you don't believe me I've missed you frequently. Tell me something. How did the Cortina thing come up? Spontaneously. How I usually do things. Why did I marry you? You're right. The bad part is that your friends are not going to forgive you for this. She's a vulgar harlot. Very presumptuous. She wants to be better than anyone. The first at everything. I can't stand her. - The crown is so tacky. - Her husband enjoys it. - That prince... - That's why I don't care. You are going down no matter if you're good or bad. I can't look at her, because I'm not going to be able to contain myself. She's entered. She's coming. Look at her queen delusions of grandeur. Pochola, honey. I couldn't wait to see you! And the crown? Where did you leave it? - On the TV set. - Tell us, tell us. How I missed you my friends. Our tea, our talks, our gossip. I'm dying to hear the news. - You tell us. - We don't have anything. - It must have been overwhelming. - Really overwhelming, Cuqui. All the privileged people of the world were there. Sounds exciting. And, how did Veronica take your crowning? - Great. - Don Pablo Fonseca too. - I already know it. - You are so lucky. Of course. They were "blessed" after all. You too. The blessing was for our friends too. Let's see if there's any luck for you... And Sonsoles? Where is Sonsoles? - That's a whole different thing. - She's in love. You don't say. - Of who? - A man. - From Spain or a foreigner? - We only know he's a man. - Bad, bad, bad, bad. - Don't think like that! A widow is a second hand product. - And it is really hard to sell. - You're horrible. Can I tell you something? - What thing? - You've made me a different man. And you've made me a different woman. I'd like to say that I love you. - So why don't you? - You only say those things in your 20s. At my age love is felt in a different way. I like this place. I found you here. Yes. - I had so many doubts then. - And now? Now I feel safe. With a huge desire to be happy. To live! I'd like to recover what I lost. I think that by being with you things will change. They've already changed, haven't they? Where are you looking at? - Hey. Eduardo! - Oh, sorry. You got so serious suddenly. Excuse me a second. - Who's that? - It's nothing... - You seem worried. - Not at all. - What did that man tell you? - Nothing. Let's go. I'll take you home. You were silent the whole way here. Sorry, I was distracted. - That man, right? - Yes. Can you tell me what is going on? Not now. Your keys. I'll call a taxi. - Are you leaving like that? - I need to think. - Come on in. It's cold. - Don't worry. I'll see you tomorrow. Come on, just for a moment. I'll pour you a drink. I won't ask you anything. - How do you feel? - I can't remember anything. Whisky is a stimulant. It's not the whisky. It's you. And this. When you are passed your 40s is when you start to appreciate these things. You talk like an old man. I'm a bit tired, and it's time to settle. That's why I thought a lot about us. The first thing I'm going to do is giving you all my money. - What for? - In your hands it'll be safer. - But to retrieve all of it I must go. - Where to? Mexico. How long? I've got to get rid of many things. That's not easy. It'll take me a month. Maybe two... I don't know if I'll be able to stand it. Before you even realize I'll be here. And how do I know you'll come back? Do you doubt it? I need you so much. Who's calling so late? A man is asking for you. Who knows I'm here? - Did he say his name? - He only said it's very urgent. They want the money tonight! Until I sell the Mexico properties... - ...I can't pay them. - I don't care! We gave you a loan and the term has expired. You are crazy! Where am I going to get one million now!? Come with me and explain it to them. I heard everything. I'd have preferred if you never knew. - Don't go. - I have to fix this. Somehow. - I'll give you the money. - No. - No way. - Why not? Shortly we'll be sharing our money. This is different. - I'll write you a check. - I said no. I have to fix this matter on my own. What do you prefer: owning them or owning me? Sonsoles, this is very unpleasant. I'm ashamed. Don't worry. Here. In your house. Those bastards. They've found the perfect moment to humiliate me. Give this to him, so he leaves. Take it. Sonsoles. We barely see each other now. We sleep in separate bedrooms. Not a glance, or a good morning. - He's jealous. - About what? I haven't done anything. About everything. Look, I'm so frivolous. I don't care about anything apparently. But sometimes I keep my feet on the ground and I can see things for what they are. And I don't like them. - That's why I try to escape reality. - What's your point? Men are like children. They want to be loved like when they were kids. They want us to be their moms. And we also have to be their: wife, friend and lover. Too many things for one life. That's cool. But my problem is still there. And it hurts me. Pablo is very classical but he's also human. He'll leave, Pochola. He'll leave me alone. You don't know him. - Table 25, Plaza de España? - The duchess always goes there. OK. And where do you take us? It's a surprise. I know, this year I'll preside the table. Is that right? You'll always preside no matter where you go. This should be done at least twice a year instead of just once. - People waste money on stupid things. - Not everyone thinks like you. Don Alberto. Here are the ladies from Fonseca and Serrano. - Show them in. - Come on in. - Alberto, how are you? - Welcome, Lady Winter. - Hi Veronica. - Hello girls. Hi. Well. The board has agreed that you will preside the table this year. And you will be the vice-president. What do you think? You are very appropriate. As you are everywhere now, we think your table will be very crowded. Don Alberto. Our table is very crowded every year. Thanks to you I bet... And your husband. This year we have to gather as much money as possible. Let's hope it doesn't rain. It'd be a shame if the new president got wet. - Calm down. This will get you nowhere. - I'm not going! So I can't be the president but that harlot can? - Cuqui, she's your friend. - She's nobody's friend! - Those rascals are the first always. - It's not so bad, honey. - Next year you'll preside. - Don't count me in! They've done me dirty. And you know how I am. That's why I put 20k every year. - And then you put even more! - So this year put 1k and it's settled. Let's see how much the president puts... You have to be generous, prince. You come from a rich family. - It all goes for charity. - I'll put as much as you want. Surprise me. By the way, where does your friend, the count, live? - Let me see. - Give me names, give me names! I want my table to be like a bank. Alright, let's see... - 50k. - Come on Carola, we're not that rich! You are so selfish. Last year you made me go there many times. - And you were so pissed. - Each time 1k... That's nothing. Each time Luisito came he gave us 10k. - He did it over 20 times! - Luisito has money to spare. - Your father too... - But I'm not my father! - You know what he told me this morning? - I don't care - Son, I'm tired of protecting you. - Another selfish man. And he's so healthy that we won't inherit anything until we're very old. Stop it. I'm not in the mood for party. If I don't do it I can't sleep... Count sheep. Did you think it through? Yes. I've thought about it a lot. Believe me. We can't live like this. My lawyers will talk to you. If you don't agree with something... Whatever you do it will be fine by me. You are a righteous man. - I don't want you to be in trouble. - I'm already in trouble. It's something I didn't count on. But it's irreversible now. Tell me something. Are you leaving me because you can't follow me or because you don't love me anymore. You know why. Yes, you too. It didn't work because I can't have children. - You're wrong. - A child would have made you happy. You managed to stand it quietly. But I've suffered deeply. I got bitter inside. That's what made us separate. No, it's been your behaviour. Your way of living, your abandon. And especially, because I don't trust you anymore. And when a man can't trust his wife it all comes tumbling down. - Do you think there is another man? - There is a woman. Which is worse. - What do you mean? - You know really well. No, I don't know what you mean. Let's leave it there. Not now! Talk to me! Look at me! Tell me what you think. What everyone thinks. You and her, and your strange relationship. And you, my husband, believe that nonsense? Pablo, a moment ago I was going to ask for your forgiveness. I was sorry for not doing anything. Whatever to avoid losing you. Now I prefer that you leave. The sooner the better. Sorry for the early start. Darling. For charity events the sooner the better. Look what the president is wearing. - She just wants attention. - I'd have worn a bikini. The way she walks too... Kisses for you girls. What a wonderful day! Take your glasses off, it's cloudy. Don't worry. We have good starting money today. Cuqui, you look wonderful. - That hat, that coat, those earrings... - I know. - Veronica, honey. - Hi, Pochola. Look at what you're wearing. Sonsoles, what a change! - Don't you like it? - Sure, but it's a bit out of place here. Girl, miniskirts are way better than coats and jewelry. They make you look old. Miniskirts are great, but you need to have nice legs and 20 years... And to be like you. Trust me Cuqui. Throw this stuff and try to be fashionable. - Why do women like girdles? - To hide what must be hidden... Unbutton yourself a bit Cuqui, you're going to suffocate. Place your bets, ladies. I open with... ...with 250k. Does anyone put more? Spanish TV live from the table presided by our lovely Cortina d'Ampezzo Lady Winter. The plates are being filled with money so it will probably be a great collection. Smile Cuqui, the whole country is watching. How do you feel about this gesture of sympathy and affection? I want to thank everyone who contributes with their generosity so that this charity event can be a success with all its great intentions. - For the sick. - Thank you. With these honest words of our gorgeous Lady Winter Spanish TV ends its live broadcast after this brilliant day. We give back the connection to our studio. Everything is fine right? I see it in your eyes. Yes. He's gone to Mexico to fix some stuff, but he'll come back soon. - I'm happy for you, Sonsoles. - And how are you? Fine. I'm always fine. - Hello. - Hi. - Luisito, what are you doing? - Is it too much, honey? - You're such a joker. - Cuqui, you scratched me with the ring! See how he's like? Don't make us beg. Come on Luisito, you have money to spare. I don't want to brag, but the rest of the tables compared to yours... - ...have nothing to do. - Luisito! - Again? - Your wife is so expressive. Well. I'll come back later. - Shall I bring you a sandwich, honey? - No! You always need to eat something. - See you later. - Bye. Bye. So good. No one is coming anymore. - Hello, Pablo. - Good morning. We were missing you. Especially your wife. Right, Veronica? I've been very busy in the office. Here you go. Is it fine? Let's see what the president thinks. The president thinks that your husband is a man. 100k from Mr. Fonseca. - Very nice. - Late, but strong. Intimidating even. Don't resent me, Pablo. Little things happen and are forgotten. The important stuff stands, and that's the important thing. I hope you collect a lot. Veronica, please. The crows notice everything. Hi, Chus. Hi. - What's wrong with you? - I think I caught something. Dress warmly. Don't get cold. I'm very healthy like your father. I left it in the bank. Or in the car. - Look for it. - I got it! Here it is. What a relief. Imagine if I lost it after that scene... - With your father? - Yes, he sends his regards. Send him mine. 50k here. This is worth a kiss, Chus. Come here. Bless you. Your prince didn't come. My prince is with two little French girls and came secretly. Like a good friend. How did you let him with his reputation. That was before. Now he's an exemplary husband. But you know that better than anybody. Veronica, you haven't touched your plate. I'm not hungry. Love troubles. People are talking... What do people talk about? You and Pablo declared war. You are going separate ways. - Such a pity. - Enough, Natalia. I hate your insinuation. - Always looking to hurt. - I'm also fed up with you. Of your presumption and airs and graces. Shut up, sorehead! Find yourself a man. A Chinese will do, there are plenty of them. - Leave our husbands alone. - You are repulsive. Spinster! You shouldn't have said that. I'm tired of her talking rubbish about everyone. You won't believe who I saw this morning. - What's wrong? What happened Sonsoles? - Leave me. - Do you feel sick? - Want me to take you home? Leave me alone, please. Leave me alone! What's wrong with her? You are eating your fill. They ate and I didn't. I'm too proud. - What you are is hungry. - Luisito... Later you complain about getting fat. Stupid. Don't ruin my dinner too... ...because this morning was awful with those bitches. - Where are you going so late? - Hunting. - Why don't you go in the morning? - I travel better at night. - You don't stop! - I'm full of life. - Ciao, prince. - Ciao. Behave yourself. She's not here. She went hunting. I don't know. Veronica. Veronica. Veronica. I went home and when I saw it empty I felt my world crumbling. I know it is hard to forget... ...but if you still love me... I could say no. But I can't. Then we will try to get back what we've lost. Veronica. Have you heard? It's as if nothing happened here. - They won't last long anyway. - And what about her? - And what about Sonsoles? - And the other one? - Hunting. - That's what she says. Poor prince...
