And how are we today? You feeling better? Be good. £16.83, please. £32.28, please. - Hi, Jan. - Hi, Jan. All right, Cath? Anne? Mam? - Are you all right? - I'm fine, love. I just knelt down to try and light the fire. Couldn't get up again. As I was here, I thought I'd have a little sit down. Oh! Quite comfy, really. She looked a goner to me. If I'd tried to get her up, I'd have ended up on the floor myself. So I said, "Best get Jan." And I said, "Don't bother her. She'll be at Tesco's." Co-op, Mam. I work at the Co-op. And how many times have I told you to leave the fire to me? I hate for you to feel you have to do everything for us. Rubbish. All she's got is that useless lump, Brian, to look after. She hasn't even got the pigeons anymore. Besides, what's a daughter for if it's not to look after her mam and dad? I told you before, son, if you lived closer I could do it and you wouldn't need to pay for a babysitter. All right. Bye-bye. State of my parents. Dad calls, said Mam's had a fall. Dashed round thinking she'd had a stroke. - She all right? - Yeah. She's just had another funny turn. It'd be so much easier if they moved in here with us. We got the room now Dennis and Sasha have flown the nest. I know you and Dad under the same roof might not be a bed of roses, but... Didn't use a glove in my day. It was just spit, rub and shove. There was that time I lost my watch up there, mind. Brian? I've won the EuroMillions. I'm having an affair with John the post. Absolutely bloody clueless. - I'm leaving you, Brian. - I've seen it all now. What's for tea, love? I nearly crashed my car earlier. Those wild ponies are down off the mountain again. Aye. Lured by chips and curry sauce. Cheer up, Gerwyn. Might never happen. You mean you paying your bar tab? I'd already drawn that conclusion. No more credit. I'm telling you, boys. Our horse, Sweet Gemma, was in the race of her life. And you know what gave her the edge? Her good breeding. Bona fide thoroughbred she was. Coming round the far bend, she's still going well. She's about four lengths clear of the third horse. I'm already running down to the front. And then I lose sight of her. I think she's gone down. My horse has fallen. And so I panic, and I'm fighting my way down to the track. And there she is, Sweet Gemma, giving it everything she's got, and she comes through on the outside and wins! - I duck under the rails... - Totally illegal. Totally illegal, and I run across the track to congratulate her. She was my horse, and she won! Haven't seen him in here before. You gotta dream big. Howard Davies, accountant-type. Used to drink up the Cross Keys. Started coming in here Thursdays after squash. Owns a racehorse, does he? Owned. Part of a syndicate. Till it all went tits up. - What happened? - He doesn't like to talk about that bit. Oh, aye. Word is, he almost lost everything: Pile of cash, house, missus. Bitter's gone. Who's having one more? Before we go? Six Stella, please. - Howard, is it? - That's right. Owned a racehorse, I gather? Couldn't help overhearing. - Must be an expensive business. - What? To buy one. Well, let's see, Sheikh Omari just shelled out 16 million for French Over, winner of the Welsh Grand National. Mind you, that was dollars, not pounds, so it's more affordable than you think. Bring them over can you, please? Thanks. You've got arms, haven't you? Gerwyn said to put it on my slate. There's a spillage in aisle six. It looks like chicken korma. - What's for tea, love? - Just starting on it now. Hello. You are not gonna believe this. The goat's got ringworm. And now this duck has got bumblefoot like the others. Here, this fella's making a complete balls-up of castrating this alpaca. It's a two-man job, see. One to hold him down by the legs and the other to nip off the squealers. Could you turn that off? I want you to help me buy a mare. You'll never learn to ride at your age. I'm going to breed a racehorse. Aye, and I'm gonna play fly-half for Wales next Saturday. I bred budgies, rabbits, whippets. Won prizes, didn't I? And pigeons. First woman to win the Welsh Open back in the day. Then let's get you another pigeon. Or two even. I'm breeding a racehorse. I've done my research. A lot more to learn, I'm sure. But there's this fella that comes in the club. - What fella? - Howard. Bit arrogant. But he's an expert, and I'm hoping he'll help. It's absolute madness. I mean, to even think of breeding a racehorse, you're gonna need to buy a thoroughbred mare. Where you gonna get one of those? "Retired pedigree racehorse for brood mare." £300? Oh, Jan, man. £300. Could have gone to Benidorm for that. - Top racehorse, she was. - No, she wasn't. I checked. But she got good ancestry, though. And her father's father's father, what a stallion. His semen has gone all over the world. You're lovely. Yes, you are. Where the bloody hell are we gonna keep her? What the hell is that? Oi. I hope you got planning permission for that, Daisy. Sod off, Maldwyn. According to council regulations, a wooden outbuilding should not exceed a maximum eaves height of 2.5 meters. Oh, what's that racket? I hope it's got its emissions certificate. No business bringing a vehicle that size down here. Thanks for the help, Goose. You're lucky the box was available, Jan. Been using it all winter to store Hoovers. All totally legit, mind. Hello. Hello. All right. Come on, Rewbell. Come on. Come on, Rewbell. Come on, Rewbell. Come on. - Come on, lovely. - Here, let me. How many animals do they think they need? Hope they're gonna clean up after it. Don't worry about this bloody circus. They can't get the bloody thing out. What about one of these? You like that? Wanna come down, yeah? Down we go. Yeah. All right. Good girl. Come on. Come on. There you are. Not much, but it's home. All right, two pints, please. So... made a start, haven't I? Sorry? Rewbell, she's called. Found it working on the beach with the other donkeys down Barry Island. Keeping it on the bloody allotment, I heard. You mean, you've actually gone and bought a mare? Gotta find the right stallion now. Seen a couple I like the look of. Yeah? You got the ten grand for the stud fees, have you? Vet's charges, stabling, insurance? And that's all before it starts racing. If it ever does. But I read up about it. There's ways of doing these things, isn't there? We set up a syndicate. 'Cause if, say, 20 people in the village put in a tenner a week for two years. I mean, I know it's complicated, but... Yeah, it is. But most people in the village haven't got two beans to rub together. It's normally wealthy, professional men who go in for this kind of thing. Bring them over, would you? I wasn't asking for your help, anyway. Right. And that's what I'm doing. I'm going to kick you out. Don't judge me, Jan. They're my only solace. Have a look at that. What do you think? Sorry, Jan, no call for it these days. Not since that scandal with the lasagne. Happily take those geese off your hands, mind. Dead or alive. The tax compliance framework for Sinclair Beatty. Need that done by 3:00. And I need this one done by lunchtime. It's that fella from the club. All right. I, uh... I thought maybe I was a bit hasty in the club. Lucky I've got thick skin, then. This is Brian. But you can call me Daisy. Just as I thought. Having to beat them back at the door, are you? Very funny, Gerwyn. Well, Jan, no one can say you didn't try, love. One more minute, Brian. Your missus know you're doing this, Howard? No danger of losing your house with this non-starter. Evening, all. Gerwyn. I'm fully briefed and ready to assess the viability of this venture. Maureen! Glad you could make it. Nothing on the telly. I just gotta say, I know absolutely sod all about racehorses. That's all right, Maureen. I've done the research for all of us. - Well, well. - Hi, Goose. - All right. - Have a seat. - Goose, is it? - Yeah. - Howard. - Nice to meet you. - Goose. - Maldwyn. I'd have been in sooner, only I had to de-gunge the mincer. You can't mix your meats. Take a seat, Nerys. Sorry, Howard. Got totally lost, mate. Hello. Peter. Daisy. Bloody satnav tried to send us into the lake. Oh, they will do that, yes. Peter and Gordon, mates from work. And this is Kev, he's my neighbor. Right. Welcome, everyone. Let's crack on. God's sake. If you lot are good enough to own a bloody racehorse, so am I. - It's a tenner every week, Kerby, you pillock. - Oh. So... the purpose of this meeting... Brian, have you got 50p? Where's the organization in this place? There you go, love. No one touch my tenner. - Oh, yes. - There you go. Bob's your uncle. Not sure I understood that last point. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I still don't quite understand. Jan is the owner of the mother, yes? When the foal is born, then everyone will be the owners. We'll all have an equal share. So, who would take the critical decisions? Which critical decisions? The horse's diet, for example. Look here. "Racehorses should be given a high-energy feed rich in nutrients. Excess consumption of grass may lead to colic and flatulence." We'll have enough of that with Kerby. But this foal doesn't exist yet. So who's the daddy? Bien Bien, he's called. American. Ten year old, won 2.3 million dollars before he retired. They wanted three grand stud fee, but I knocked them right down. - Which we will pay. - Gonna rob a bank, are you, Daisy? Which we will pay out of our retirement fund, until the syndicate is up and running and can reimburse us. One thing I must stress, above all else. If you do join, don't do it expecting to make money. There's a less than one percent chance this horse will ever win a race. So, do it for the "hwyl." That's what this is all about. You mean like, the "craic"? With respect, the "hwyl" is not the same as the "craic." The "craic" is a Gaelic term, whereas the "hwyl" comes from the Brythonic branch of the Celtic languages and means "a feeling of emotional motivation and energy." Right. I'll do it for the "hwyl." Of course I will. Yeah, go on. We'll both do it for the... - What's it called again? - The "hwyl." English. Yeah. In. - Yes. - Yeah, me too. In. Gerwyn? Well... if there's gonna be a circus in town, may as well have a ringside seat. Mrs. Vokes? - I'm James. - Sorry we're late. Oh, that's all right. This won't take long. Bien Bien doesn't mess about. Oh, God, he's handsome, though. And this is Rewbell. I'm not gonna lie. One of us has left a present in the corner. Come on then, girl. What do you think? Here we go. Yeah. Well, Bien Bien is known to upgrade his mares. - Go get him, girl. - Brian. We should have watched. Would you like to be watched? I'm not a stallion. You can say that again. I've had my moments, haven't I? Still, having a bit of fun now, aren't we? Never knew how much I missed messing about with horses. It's more than "a bit of fun" and "messing about," Brian. Yeah. What do you mean? I don't know. I mean... I need something to look forward to when I get up in the morning. To remind me that things can... change. That was good cover! I hope he bought her a drink first! What are you looking at? What do you want, then? Eh? What do you want? Oh, I know. I know. It's my mints you're after, isn't it? Eh? You only want me for my mints. Brian? Oh, my God. I said! Didn't I say it'd be this week? I'm on my way. Jan. Jan, can I have a word? Jan! Hello. Oh, God, he's gorgeous, isn't he? Hello. Where's Rewbell? We've lost her, love. I come down first thing and the foal had been born. There he was, bright as a button. But I could see straightaway that Rewbell wasn't right. So I called Ron and... There was nothing we could do, was there, Ron? Lovely, isn't he? Maureen. Goose. I wasn't sure we should carry on after Rewbell. Poor old girl. But look at him. He's a real fighter. Will you look at that. What about Foal Throttle? - Butcher's Boy. - Daisy Chain. - Lost Youth. - Colt Leader. - Don't Tell The Missus. - Welsh Wind! Kerby's the expert on Welsh wind. What about Colin? After Colin Jackson. I used to love seeing him fly over those hurdles. What about Dream Alliance? It's our dream and we're all in it together, like an alliance, so Dream Alliance. - Very good. - I like that, Jan. That's good. Nah. Let's have a vote. "Cefn Rocket," three votes. - "Kerby," one vote. - Worth a shot. "Dream Alliance," 12 votes. Hey! So, I am completely chuffed to the bollocks to announce the winner is Dream Alliance! Dream Alliance! - Dream Alliance! - Dream Alliance! - Go on, Dream. - Go on, Dreamy boy. So, you got a name. Dream Alliance. What do you think? One time when I was a girl, Dad and me took Sammy and Murphy, our whippets, to a dog show in Pontypridd. Didn't think we had a hope in hell, us nobodies from the back of beyond. But we got first and second prize. Dad was so proud of me. Took me for a milk shake at Gambarini's café after to celebrate. Mmm. Seemed like anything was possible. Hungry are you, boy? There you go, boy. This driveway's longer than our high street. Are you sure about this, love? Philip Hobbs is the best trainer in the country. This is where Dream should be. Hello? Well, you've missed the turning. It's a mile back down the road. No, mate, no. I've come about the position of trainee jockey. - Pardon? - We've made an appointment with Mr. Hobbs. Uh... I'm afraid the guv'nor's with an owner. - Let's get him out, Brian. - Aye. - Guv'nor? - Excuse me. They say they've got an appointment? I'm afraid I know nothing about this. Howard arranged an appointment with your office. - Who's Howard? - Howard Davies. Helps me run our syndicate. Come on, then, boy. Come on, let's show them. This is our boy. Dream Alliance. You've actually brought the horse with you? I'm sorry. I'm busy right now. If an appointment was made, it would have only been for a preliminary chat so you could view the facilities and discuss our charges. I know about your charges and I'm sorry we didn't come in a helicopter. We'll take our custom elsewhere. Brian. Come on, boy. Back to the valleys for us. Look, you've obviously come a long way. Johnson, get the horse saddled up and put him in the arena. I'll give you an honest opinion. Brian. - What? - Get him out. Come on, boy. Come on. Calm. Come on, boy. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. With a bit of work... be worth giving him a crack at your local gymkhana. Good luck. Come on. Walk on. He's not having it, Jan. Come on, boy. Walk on. Come on. Come on, lad. Come on. Come on. Come on, boy. Walk on. Come on. That's it. Come on. Come on. Good boy. Good boy. Guv'nor? Well? He's pretty rough around the edges... but he's definitely got something about him. It's... spirit. Character. Like his owners. We'll take him for a couple of months, see what we can do. - No promises. - Thank you. That's all I wanted. Johnson will sort you out with a stable and we'll go from there. I'll miss you, Dream. I'll be thinking of you every day. This is what you were born to do. Be brave and brilliant. Okay. Walk on. Hello? Any news about your pony, love? Racehorse, Mam. - No, nothing. - Oh, thank you. Howard calls occasionally and all they say is they're still assessing him. A horse raised on an allotment has got a cat in hell's chance of ever racing. Howard says while they've still got him, there's hope. Brian had a horse once, didn't he? Lovely big teeth it had. Now, he hasn't got the horse, or the teeth. - Let me, Brian. You get off home. - It's damp. Well, a fat lot of use he was. He can't help his arthritis. He could have helped getting our Janet in the family way when she was only 17. It's been 30 years, Dad. Can you just leave it, now? Hello? We're going to the races. - What? - Philip Hobbs just e-mailed us. But he's gonna put Dream in a bumper race for beginners. Oh, my God, he's gonna race? Our horse is gonna race! Right, I'm off! Was Davina okay with you taking the day off? Oh, yeah. Not to worry, love. All taken care of. How come you're leaving so early, anyway? Chepstow's not that far. Well, Kev and I just wanted to make a real day of it. You know, savor the atmosphere. Have a couple of bevvies and a bar snack. Ta, love. You still haven't told Angela about all this? You know, I'll let her know in time. She'll be absolutely fine with it. - Good luck, Jan! - Thanks, lovely! John! - Here he comes! - Fine figure of a man. Slept in, did we, Kerby? No, no. You're not sitting here. Your flies are undone. The cage may be open, but the beast is asleep. Room for two more? - Oh, the dynamic duo. - We are off to the races! - Oggy, oggy, oggy! - Oi, oi, oi! Oh, I haven't been so excited since Wales beat England that day at Wembley! Shat on them, we did! Here we go, here we go! What a sight. The jockeys are so small. Come on, everyone. Owners' and trainers' bar, here we come. I suppose we should put a bet on. Yeah, 10-to-1 Kerby gets drunk. Do you know how to make a small fortune out of horses? Start with a large fortune. Sorry, sir. Owners only. I am a bloody owner. - May I look in your bag? - You haven't asked to look in their bags. You can't bring alcohol onto the course. Who says I've got alcohol? Cheese sandwiches, that's all. He's gonna get us all chucked out. All right, then. - Bloody knew it. - Come on, mate. Look out. Welsh champagne. Be here all day. You'll be pissing like a racehorse. Come on. Never mind him. Come on. Classy in here, ain't it? Nice soft lighting. All the big knobs are in here. I seem to have misplaced mine. Strictly no admission into the owners' enclosure without a pass. Ooh, finger food, is it? - Some for later? - Brian. They're free, love. Oh, here he is. Had to get Philip Hobbs to vouch for me, didn't I? How about this, eh? Do you think that Clare Balding off the telly will be here? 38 quid, the cheeky buggers! That'd buy a drink for the whole bloody room in my club. Look, look, look. It's Lord Avery. He owns White Knight and Conquering Hero. And most of Oxfordshire. Pals, are we? We're Lord Snooty's bloody equal today. - Oh, look out. He's off again. - Ooh... I'm sorry. Have we met? We have now, butt. Tempt you to a can? It's nice to share a drink with a fellow owner, isn't it? Ah, you're an owner. How many? Well, there's about 20 of us. All right! I mean, how many horses do you own? - Just the one. - Excellent. Enjoy it. A little tip before the race. Ah, go on. If you're using the gents, give the first cubicle a few minutes. And the horses for the bumper race are making their way to the paddock. - Here we go. - We're up next. - Everyone got your bets on? - Yeah. Wait. We must have a toast. That's right. To us. To us. To Dream. To Dream. Come on. We're moving on here at Chepstow. The conditions are good, so we should have quite a tussle in this race for beginners. Jockeys are mounting and they're making their way down to the start. So, he's there. He's up on the big screen. There he is. Oh, look, there he is. They're all on the racecourse and should be good to go. Horses are circling at the starting line. Number six, Inarco, in the purple and orange. Dream Alliance, number three, in the red and white. And Forgive Me Mary, an impressive winner at Kelso. A bit reluctant to join the others at this stage is Dream Alliance. He's become a bit playful down at the start. Oh, God. Tapes are across. Starter's getting up there. Perhaps they'll have to go around again and walk in. Hopefully with Dream Alliance. He doesn't look happy. His first race. Bound to be a bit edgy. Edgy? He's facing the wrong way. Let's see if he settles down. If he keeps going in that direction, he'll end up back in the village. - They are under orders. - Turn around, boy. Dream Alliance still having a bit of bother. - Will he let them go? - Turn him around! Turn him around! He's at the back! Look! He can't let them go, can he? Turn around. Come on. Turn around, man! They've all gone! He'll be in front if he waits for the next race to start. Come on! It's a disastrous start for Dream Alliance. He's about ten lengths behind the pack. I hope you're gonna give us a refund, Jan. Come on, Dream, boy. - Come on. - He's miles behind the others. Then on the inside, Forgive Me Mary. And still trailing by six, possibly eight lengths, is Dream Alliance looking very green at the back of the pack. Even Daisy could run faster. It was fun while it lasted. Come on, Dreamy boy, you can do it. Mate, what a waste of money! Inarco and Forgive Me Mary in the middle of the field. Look at him now. He's found the accelerator. Clawing back some ground is Dream Alliance. He's our boy! Come on, lad. Come on, my boy. He's coming! He's coming! Dream Alliance pushes forward. And he's on Inarco's heels now. And as Cornell goes for broke, Penelope Star in second. Inarco slips back. Go on, Dream. Dream Alliance battles his way into fourth. Go on, Dream! Come on, Dream! Dream Alliance making a real challenge to get amongst the top three. Come on! Cornell takes it, second Penelope Star. High And Clear in third. And Dream Alliance coming in a strong fourth place. Fourth! Fourth! Fourth! I had him down for fourth! Yes! I won 20 quid! No bloody chips! Well done, my boy. Your mam would have been so proud of you. We're gonna need a bigger bus! Hi, love. How's things? Angela? You promised me you'd never, ever even think of doing it again. You can't possibly have forgotten what it was like last time. Coming this close to losing the house. Having to raid the kids' uni fund to pay off the mortgage arrears. All for some bloody horse. And worst of all, you've lied to me, Howard. I know. I shouldn't have lied. I swore I'd leave you if you ever got into another syndicate. And I've learnt my lesson, and this won't get out of hand, I promise. I'm gonna have those words written on your bloody gravestone. It's completely different this time. There's a few of us just chipping in a tenner a week to have a bit of fun. That's all it is. Nothing is more important to me than you. This family. Well, you have to make your own choices. But I don't want anything to do with it. And if you dare jeopardize what we've got again... And that was when I pinched Dai Fats' prized cock! Have a look at this! We made the front page of the Argus! Must be building a tidy balance in the bank now. Aye, all that prize money, but no mention of when we'll see any of it. You must be a witch, Jan Vokes. Gotta be some reason you got so lucky. We'll win the Cheltenham Gold Cup, one day. I swear we will. Come on. Let's go play some dominos. No, let's have a game of darts. Hello, gorgeous. How are you doing? You're looking lovely. The other day at work I spent two hours stacking tinned sweet corn. And all I could think about was... Well... All my life... I've never been me. I've been Elsie's daughter, Dennis and Sasha's mother... or Daisy's wife. But watching you race... I'm Jan. Mrs. Vokes. Don't wanna disturb you. - I'm sorry. - Sorry for what? He's your horse. Anyway, glad you dropped by. Got some news for you. Really? Newbury? - Where's the owners' bar, then? - There, boy. My God, Howard. You weren't wrong. This really is something else. Have any of you spotted Clare Balding? She must be around somewhere. - There's a rumor Mick Jagger's here. - Ooh. Not that I'm bothered, mind. I suppose you're used to this, hanging out with the big knobs. - How do you mean? - That's what you do all day, isn't it? Telling them rich buggers how they can avoid paying tax. Bit more complicated than that, Kerby. I call it legalized robbery, myself. I've just had a pee next to Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber. I told him I thought Evita was a far superior work to Phantom of the Opera. Right, so look here. Dream's still way out at 16-to-1. Fearless Pursuit is massive odds-on. He's one of His Lordship's horses. He's won the last nine out of ten races. This time he really is up against the big boys. And she bred the damn horse on an allotment! An allotment! It's almost time for the main event here at Newbury Festival, the King Edward Challenge over two miles. Lord Avery's horse, Fearless Pursuit, is the bookies' favorite, hoping for yet another victory. He's shaping up to be a true legend of the track. - You all right, girl? - It's a big race, Brian. Hurdles and everything. He's never done that on a course this size. Out next is My Heaven, in the light blue, followed by reigning champion, Fearless Pursuit, number four, in yellow and lilac. Owned, of course, by Lord Avery. And the horse raised on an allotment, Dream Alliance, number three, in the red and white striped cap. The horses taking a look at the first hurdle in the King Edward Challenge. A wide range of experience amongst our runners today. For some of them, this is their first time over jumps. - They're being called back now. - Come on, then, boy. And they'll soon be good to go. - There we go. - Come on, hurry up. Dream Alliance yet to win a race. Fearless Pursuit looking every inch the aristocrat. Trained at the Berkshire court stables, let's see if Fearless Pursuit can reign victorious again. I think we're good to go for this famous race. The flag is raised. I've got sweaty palms. Feel. Bunched nearly together. It's a pretty good start. Chauncey Lad taking the early lead at the front. A certain amount of jockeying for position in behind. Now muscling past Spring Morning is Lord Avery's Fearless Pursuit, number four, asserting his dominance early as they approach the first hurdle. My Heaven in third, then Kelly's Nan, then Justice Jones and Dream Alliance right in the middle of the pack. First jump, always a challenge. The leaders are over, followed by the rest of the pack. Good job! Fearless Pursuit and Spring Morning, neck and neck as they come over the next hurdle. That's a nasty fall. Jeanguin, out of the race. Both rider and horse up on their feet. That's good to see. Dream Alliance takes it pretty smoothly. Setting a fast pace is Fearless Pursuit, who won this race in commanding fashion last year. They approach the next jump. Dream Alliance inching his way up the pack. Come on. You can do this, boy. Come on, my boy! Dream Alliance muscles past and finds his way into fourth as they round the far bend. Oh, my God, he's doing it! Heading round to the final straight. Dream Alliance giving all he's got. Come on, Dream! Come on, my boy! Dream Alliance showing real spirit. The boy from the valleys scrapping his way past My Heaven and Spring Morning, letting Fearless Pursuit know he's got a real fight on his hands. Dream Alliance threatening the reigning champion, Fearless Pursuit. This is now a two-horse race as they take the second last. Come on, Dream! They're safely over the last hurdle. It's a titanic battle. He's gonna do it! Dream Alliance pulls ahead of Fearless Pursuit. - He's gonna do it! - This rank outsider digging deep and showing his class. We did not see this coming! Fight back! Come on, boy! Could we be witnessing the arrival of a new champion? The young novice is powering ahead, a length clear. Now two lengths! Dream Alliance, he smells victory. Untouchable now as he pulls ahead. And wins! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Dream Alliance stealing the crown from Fearless Pursuit in a remarkable turnaround here at Newbury. They'll be dancing in the Welsh valleys tonight. Please welcome to the winner's enclosure the King Edward Challenge champion, Dream Alliance! Not on my hat! We are so proud of you. So proud. And now it's time to present the Challenge Cup to Janet Vokes and the Alliance Partnership. Is that real gold? And not forgetting, of course, the check for £26,250! Split evenly. Of course. - Congratulations. - Thank you. Bad luck about your Fearless Pursuit, butt. Has it occurred to you this might be time to take a tidy profit? How do you mean? I'm prepared to make a substantial offer. Oh, God. I'd never sell him. Never. You haven't heard the offer yet. I wouldn't sell him for 500 million. Well, if you change your mind. Hang on a minute. That's not right. What, the idea of selling Dream? No, it's bloody ridiculous. No, I mean him offering to buy him off Jan. The horse belongs to all of us. Correct. Any financial offer should be put formally to the syndicate for consideration. We're not selling him and that's that. With respect, Jan, that's not for you to say. Are you deaf, Gerwyn, or what? She's just bloody said it. Legally she has no right to. But morally she has every right. Surely we can all agree about that? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Come on, boys. Let's just celebrate our win. Oi, Rossi, feet off the chairs. It's absolute pandemonium in here. I don't recognize half this lot. I know. Once upon a time, people didn't even want to admit they came from this village. Now half the valleys reckon they live here. How much do you reckon Lord Snooty would have offered us for Dream? Tens, maybe hundreds of thousands. Thanks for standing up for me before. That's okay. We both know this has always been about something much more important than money. ...e-mail you sent yesterday to Sinclair Beatty. Care to read it? "Just quit moaning and pay up, you bastards." They had a tax bill. I'm a tax advisor. I advised them to pay it. You know, Howard, I've started to wonder lately why you came into this profession. Oh, you're not the only one. 'Cause I have no idea why I sit behind this desk all day, helping rich bastards, who can well afford to pay their share, save millions in tax while people out there can barely afford to put food on their tables. You know, it's... legalized robbery. Howard, mate. Has to be something better I can do with my life. He's taking the lamp. Why is he taking the lamp? Resigned? What were you thinking? I wasn't thinking. That's the whole point. I was just... It's what I feel. It's what I felt for years. I can't do that job anymore. This is that bloody horse again, isn't it? Being involved with Jan and the syndicate has made me feel like I'm part of something important for the first time in years. And it's bloody fabulous. It's selfish! And it's reckless! I can work it out. We'll manage. Oh, how exactly? On my wages? So, I've been talking to Philip, and he reckons Dream's bouncing, in the form of his life. Howard reckons it's partly that new probiotic food they got him on. And they've got him in that new equine swimming pool. Dream absolutely loves it, apparently. Howard says swimming is brilliant for building up muscle strength in the hindquarters. Brian? What's the matter? Nothing. Come on, spit it out. I miss him, is all... Dream. It's stupid, isn't it? Missing something I didn't even know I wanted. No, it's not stupid. But still... that's the way life is. I shouldn't grumble. But life's not like that, Brian. That's the whole point. There's a whole world out there you don't see because you're just sat watching the telly. You what? Look, when Dream arrived... I saw you light up. Look, I know you miss him. But don't just... settle back into your old ways again. I shouldn't have said anything. I don't mind really. I'm happy enough. No, Brian, you're always "happy enough." You lost your job, you said, "Never mind, another one will come along." And it never did. You got arthritis, you said, "Oh, well, we all get old and ill sooner or later." I mean, when I first met you, you were a fighter. And now you just accept things. You don't fight anymore. So, what your dad said was right. You could have done a lot better for yourself. So I can evade tax, but I can't avoid it. Other way around, Nerys. Avoid, not evade. - Evasion they don't like. - Got it. Um... things are a little tight cash-wise these days, so... best sirloin. - Cheers, Nerys. - Enjoy. - Oh. Hello, Nerys. - Jan. It's looking very smart, Howard. Well, the refurbishment is, um, ongoing. How come, though? You had a good job in Cardiff, didn't you? Uh, well, I realized I couldn't do it anymore. And I wasn't gonna live a life of lost chances like my dad. - What happened to him? - Uh... ran away from home at 14 with a dream of being a famous jockey. Lied about his age, got a job at a racing stables. The coppers tracked him down, bought him home. Became a lifer at the steelworks and... that was that. "Don't let them crush your dreams," he used to say. And at least I've had plenty of time to keep on top of the syndicate finances. Believe it or not, we're showing an overall profit of about a hundred grand. Good God. I never in a million years thought we'd make this kind of money. That's not the only good news. Philip Hobbs wants to race Dream at Aintree on Saturday. - Oh, my God. - I know, I know. - A wedding, is it? - No, Mam. It's two of the yellow ones, Dad. - I've taken two. - No, you've only taken the white. Sasha? Is our Sasha getting married? No, Mam. I told you. I'm off to Aintree 'cause Dream's racing there. Aintree! Bert, did you hear that? We'll watch it on the telly, Jan. We love doing that. I need you to pick up my prescription from the chemist. Is that all you can say, Dad? - What? - The horse I bred is racing in the biggest meet in the calendar, and that's all you can say? I'll see you later. Welcome to Aintree, where we've got a record-breaking attendance on the course of 75,000 people here to celebrate the very best of British racing. The going is good as the horses gather at the starting line for the next race. A three-mile, half-a-furlong handicap over hurdles. There he is! Looking good. All right, Daisy? Tidy enough, thanks. Horses coming out onto the course led by Real Charmer, very much on his toes, keen to get on with things, alongside Aurora's Encore, a winner here just two days ago. Dream Alliance, in his now-familiar red and white colors, is number three on your card, and number one is According To Pete. Come on, then, boy. Hey, he's looking good. Over there, look. Come on, Dreamy! Starter is calling them forward. I've got a good feeling about this one. Come on, Dream! Flag is up. And they're off and racing. So, the field leave the tapes bunched together. Buena Vista, the first one to show... Take it easy. Good start. Dream Alliance challenging According To Pete, racing in the blue and white colors, currently in the middle of the field. Come on, Dreamy boy. Deep Focus edges past Buena Vista now, while Dream Alliance tries to make ground on the outside of According To Pete. Deep Focus is out of the race. Takes a pretty hefty fall. Horse and jockey look okay... - Is he up? - ...and quickly on their feet. Come on, Dream! ...as they approach the next flight of hurdles. Dream Alliance is jumping with real confidence now. - Come on, Dream. Come on, boy! - He's up into third place, chased hard by both Superior Wisdom, - and then comes Aurora's Encore. - Come on, Dream! Come on, Dream! Dream Alliance now just a length and a half behind. Dream Alliance and According to Pete neck and neck. Nothing between these two as they take the next. And the field head round the final bend. Buena Vista continues to lead the way. According To Pete on his outside. Superior Wisdom in third and behind them Aurora's Encore. Where's Dream? I can't see him, either. Howard, can you see anything? He's not there. - Can you see him? - Oh, Jesus. Oh, what's happening? Let me see. They're putting screens around him. Means they're gonna shoot him, don't it? Stay calm, everyone. The vet's arrived. They can't shoot him. If his leg's broken they'd have to, Jan. Okay, I'm calling Philip. What are they saying? Pick up, Philip, pick up. Philip? Put him on speaker. - Philip, what's happening? - They can't tell how bad it is, but it looks like he's severed a tendon. That's serious, isn't it? If confirmed, then he'd never run again. - Philip? - Yeah. Hold on. Oh, please, God, we can't lose him. We can't lose him. We can't. It's kinder to put a horse down immediately in these circumstances, you know. Whoa! Stand clear! Hello, Howard? Vet thinks the tendon may not be completely severed and there's a chance it could be repaired. Then try, for God's sake! If there's the faintest chance of saving him! I have to warn you, if the tendon can't be repaired, he'd still have to be euthanized. - Right, Philip. - And if we remove him from the course and the operation does fail, you'd lose the insurance money and, of course, face substantial bills. Philip, we don't have time. I really need an answer. Well, how much is he insured for? Currently, 120 thousand pound. Maybe we need to discuss this. No, there's nothing to discuss. What's there to discuss? Well, 120 grand, to start with. That's a hell of a lot of money. Look, he belongs to all of us, and any decision about what happens to him should be taken collectively. - It's a fair point. - Yeah, but... Like it should have been that day Lord Avery offered to buy him. You're not still on about that, Gerwyn? - Wait. Listen. - This is a syndicate, isn't it? He's suffering and all alone! Everybody be quiet and just listen to Janet! Look, before Dream... who were we? Gerwyn? Kerby? We lost our jobs, our community. Even lost our pride. And then Dream came along and reminded us all what life is like when you have hope. Dream's out on that course in agony, his life hanging by a thread, and you're talking about putting a gun to his head so you can have a couple of grand in your pockets. Too bloody right. Dream's never asked us for anything before. - He's just given us his all. - Yeah. Dream has given me a second chance. He's given us all a second chance. And now... I think we need to give him one. - Fair enough. - Yeah. Right. Philip. Tell them they gotta do whatever they can to try and save him. Steady! Steady, Dream. Anything? Brian, I... It's... It's all right, girl. Dream's had an accident. They've been operating on him through the night. Philip? What's the news? I see. Right. Okay, thanks. Well? We hope he'll be able to walk again. But you do understand, the chances of him racing again are virtually nonexistent. All I care about is he gets well. And if the tendon won't heal and he's lame, well, then we'll have to consider his quality of life. Hello. God, Dream. You had me worried. Thank you. Mrs. Davies? Angela? I'm Jan. From the syndicate. Oh, right. Hi. How's Howard? Haven't seen him in a while. Not since what happened with Dream. Yes, I heard. I was, um, so sorry about his accident. Thanks. He's alive. That's the main thing. Yes. Well, I... I just, um... wanted to say I think it's brilliant... supporting Howard the way you did with the syndicate and everything. I mean, after the last time, a lot of wives wouldn't have done that. It wasn't until he told me that story about his dad running away and becoming a jockey that I really understood why this mattered to him so much. But I guess you knew that all along. Yes. Well, thanks. That's £18.90, please. Thanks. - Brian? - Listen, Jan. It's your dad. I'm sorry. I've called an ambulance, but... I'm two minutes away. Well, there he is. Oh, good God. You said he could walk. But is he really up to being ridden? Oh, he's going pretty well, isn't he? Well done, boy. Unbelievable! My God. - I swear he winked at me. - It's miraculous. The stem cell treatment was a complete success. The vet thinks the tendon's stronger now than before the injury. He's running faster than ever. How come you never mentioned he was coming on so well? Didn't want to raise any false hopes until we were sure. Of what? We think he's ready to race again. - You're joking. - We're thinking The Welsh National. - That would be incredible. - But after all he's been through... I need to be sure it's what you want. I can't bear the thought of him risking his life again! I just don't think we can take the risk. Not after all that's happened. But it'd be the comeback of all comebacks! That's rich. You were ready to write him off. - We'd all written him off. - You saw him on the gallops. And you heard what Philip Hobbs said. It's miraculous. I mean, surely it's a sign. Dream wants to keep going. - He lives to race. - It's in his blood, innit? Out on that track, when he was hurt, you said we owed him a chance because of what he'd done for us. What was that chance for if not to let him race again? But not at The Welsh Grand National. It's too dangerous. Tell him, Brian. It's just too big a risk. I would, Jan. But I can see what they're saying. How could you? That's why I'm single, see? Jan. - I thought you cared about Dream. - I do. Of course I care about him. When Dream come along, took me right back to when I was young. Wanting to be a farmer. All those hopes I'd given up on. And it hurt like hell when he went to live at the stables. Almost as much as it hurt when he fell at Aintree. You spoke for him then, when he couldn't. But if Dream was here now and he could speak... ...he'd tell you he wants to race. It's in his blood. You know I'm right. Let him run, Jan. I just can't bear the thought of him getting hurt again. I know. But you were right. We can't stop ourselves from dreaming of bigger things. Come on, love. Come on. There you go. See ya. Hey, Kerby. Where's your glad rags? You better get a shift on, mate, or you'll miss the coach. I'm not going. Can't afford it, butt. You gotta come. Come, we'll have a whip-round. Bugger off. I'll put the money I'm saving by not going on Dream. Twenty quid, Dream Alliance to win. I'll watch it in the club with a pint in my hand. Now, you tell our boy to run the race of his life. Right, I'm off. Why are you all... We thought we might come along, too. What the hell is that? What do you reckon? Angela and the kids in there. Howard, you're lying down in the hearse. I couldn't fit you all in the coach! We had to think laterally! - Come on. Follow me. - In you go, love. It's gonna be all right, isn't it? - Good luck, Jan. - Cheers, John. - Oggy, oggy, oggy! - Oi, oi, oi! - Oggy, oggy, oggy! - Oi, oi, oi! Is it starting? Yeah, it's starting now. - Excuse me... - Let us watch this! I should never have said yes to putting these bets on for the boys in the club. You start down that end. Tenner each on Dream Alliance to win. Sharpish. We can't miss the anthem. Welcome, everyone, to Chepstow to the greatest day in the Welsh race calendar, the day of the Welsh Grand National! And welcome back to the course from a serious injury, from the valleys, Dream Alliance! And to his breeder, Janet Vokes. And now please join with that great voice of Wales, Katherine Jenkins, in the singing of the Welsh National Anthem. Go on, my boy! Oh, my God, is that Rod Stewart? Oh, he never misses the Welsh. The horses circling now, raring to race. There they are. This year's runners and riders in the Welsh Grand National. Dream Alliance there. First race back after a long convalescence. Looking a little bit unsettled. Oh, God, there he is. His ruptured tendon the cause of his nerves, perhaps. Understandable. Le Beau Bai, number nine, is the bookies' favorite after a great year for him. Tapes go across and we'll be under starter's orders. Anxious wait while the starter raises his flag. Under starter's orders! Come on, Dream. Come on, man. The flag drops and we're off on this Welsh Grand National! A grueling race that has seen plenty of drama in its time. Come on, Dream. Go on, boy. Leading now is Operation Houdini, in the yellow and black. Get around safely, eh? Just get around safely. Having work to do at the rear of the pack is Dream Alliance, number three. Come on, boy! As they head into the first bend, Operation Houdini still holds his position in the lead. - He's coming over the rise down there. - Come on, man. The pack are now climbing steeply on this punishing course. Ahead of them looms the challenge of the first fence. Coming to the first now. Here we are. Come on, Dream! Dream Alliance still the back marker approaching the second fence. He's got it! And they're all over clear. Approaching the far bend, Operation Houdini slipping away. Come on, lad. Come on, my boy. Dream Alliance looks like he's making a move! Muscling through, pushing Cornish Chef then Nositch out of the way. - He's away! - Go, Dream! The pack rounding the far bend and Dream Alliance sneaks past Hello Bud and Old Benny. Go on, boy! Look, Jan! Dream Alliance battling his way past Operation Houdini as he barges into second place! This is incredible! Silver By Nature has got a real scrap on his hands now! Dream Alliance and Silver By Nature locked in a duel as they approach the second to last. Come on, boy! Come on! Dream Alliance tightening every sinew as they take the final jump. A slip by Silver By Nature, and Dream Alliance lands ahead and steals the lead for the very first time in the race! - Yes, yes! - Come on! Dream Alliance in first place, but Silver By Nature is fighting back! He's pulling away from Dream Alliance! Go, my boy! Both horses giving it everything they've got. - My boy! - Dream Alliance pulling ahead! - Go on! - The boy from the valleys proving he's up there with the best in the world! Go, Dream! Hey! First place, Dream Alliance. A fairy-tale return from injury to conquer this Welsh Grand National! Oh, lovely! Dream, Dream, Dream! Yay! I bloody knew he was a champion right from the start! You did it. Hey, well done, girl. Well done. Please give a rapturous welcome to the horse born on an allotment and now the Welsh Grand National champion, Dream Alliance! Come on, Dreamy boy! You gorgeous, clever, lion-hearted boy, you. Well done! Well done. I told you he's got spirit. Who'd have thought, eh? Well done. - Oh, thank you. - Bloody well done. Yes! - Oh, Maldwyn's crying. - No, I'm not. Where's Howard? Howard? All right? Yeah. Yeah. Just needed a moment. Quiet word with Dad... about how this win was for him. He'd be very proud. Dream's a beauty, isn't he? Proper valleys boy. Hey, best day of my life! Oh, what a day! - Oggy, oggy, oggy! - Oi, oi, oi! - Oggy, oggy, oggy! - Oi, oi, oi! - Oggy! - Oi! - Oggy! - Oi! - Oggy, oggy, oggy! - Oi, oi, oi! Whoo-hoo-hoo!
