I wanna tell ya, ya got a great product, by God. We believe in it, and if it works for us, it's gonna work for you. We're all here next year, thank you. [cheers, applause] Well, the question I hear most often around my congregation is, "Reverend, how do you keep the faith?" In these troubled, turbulent times with chaos and confusion, where our morals are under assault, our values, our very code of existence is under threat of extinction. How does one keep the faith? Well, it's very simple, gentlemen, I grasp them by the hand and I look into the eyes, and I tell them, "I read the bible." You know, people often refer to an instruction manual as a bible. Uh, the bible of automotive repair, the bible of, uh, baseball stats. These bibles are complete. Our bible is not complete. Our bible is open-ended. It's more than a guideline with rules and regulations for living. It's our imagination. It is the very essence of our life. Goodness and evil. Cruelty. Charity. Wisdom and foolishness. Crime and punishment. You sell the bible. You need to know this. You are the difference. You. Keep the faith. [applause] - Thank you, Reverend. Thank you very much, Reverend. Words to live by, gentlemen, words to live by. [microphone feedback] Now, to lighten things up a little bit, I've got some stag movies down in my room. You're all welcome. [cheers, applause] You know, Sidney's been with me 15 years. He's the only Jew I know that's selling Bibles to Gentiles. Not to mention making a profit. Only all the Catholics, Reverend. [laughing] Very powerful speech, Reverend. Oh, I'm glad you enjoyed it, not too heavy-handed, I hope? Oh, no, no, spoken like a believer, a true believer, Reverend. Well, there's words of wisdom for all of us in the bible, even the naysayers. So, how is the convention this year, as informative as ever? Oh, yeah... you know, every year is a new angle, but this year, I-I think we're really getting up to speed, and, uh, I'm happy to say that my men are right on top of it. We're not quitters. Well, it's like my father said to me, "Arthur, the day you quit the bible business is the day the good Lord tells you it's quitting time." Well, I hope the Reverend Dent is not making a nuisance of himself this morning! - Jack! - How are ya? - Hello, Bill, how are ya? - Oh, Jack! How are ya? Good to see you! - My pleasure. You know my men here, uh, Sidney. Oh, hello, Sidney. How are you? How's Sherry? Oh, she's fantastic. Thank you for asking. And Herman? Where's your brother? Well, Herman's been ill. He retired a few months ago. So he's no longer with the company, I'm sorry to say. Sorry to hear that. Bill did not inform me of that. I usually like to make it a point to, you know, know all about my past employees who may be ailing. Please send him my best. - I'd be happy to, thank you.

Moving, Bill, not closing, okay? Well... why are you thinking about moving us? Ann and I have studied the operation for some time now.

Now, we're spec-- specializing in this particular edition at this time of year because we know that, within a year, the value of this bible will triple. I'm not kidding you, ma'am, it will triple. Now, what do you think ma'am? Would you, would you be interested in, uh, buying one of these today? I-- I don't think so, not right now. Would, uh, later on, say six o'clock be fine with you, ma'am? - Tonight? - Tonight. No, sir. Okay, what time would be more convenient for you? Well, I have no income right now, so it would have to depend on when I get income. Oh, I see. And another gook bites the fuckin' dust. Yeah, that's nice. Yeah. What'd you say the price was? For your business today, this is $500. The glock normally goes for 350, I'll give it to you for 175. Go ahead, put that in your belt. And then, absolutely free, at not additional charge, that's right, throw in the pansy popper for your wife, huh? God. I'm a walking army in the neighborhood. That's right, sir. We believe in a well-armed family, and a well-read family. [TV playing faintly] Looks like somebody had a good day. Nobody wants to talk, nobody wants to buy. Hey, Sidney, uh, did you get those tickets? Nope, sold out. - Damn, already? - Yup. Well now, we've come all this way, we gotta see Neil Diamond. What about Monday night? Tonight's his last show. Damn. We gotta... We gotta see Neil. I mean, how often do you get to see Neil play Vegas? Neil never plays Vegas. What if we hang around? We can get some tickets. Yeah, where's he playing? At the Ce-- at Caesar's? - Yup. - Well, yeah, there's gotta be scalpers. Hey, Stan, you wanna go with me? No, I... I'm gonna stay in, I think I caught some kind of disease in that trailer park today. Aww. Sidney, what about you? Mm... Yeah... Yeah, okay, I'll come down. Why not? - Good! My kind of man. Hey, Neil'll be proud you showed up, you know, one Jew to another. [chuckles] Hey, you know, all you kikes should be like Neil. You know, what a guy. He's a talented guy. He should be king of the fucking Jews. Christ, Phil, you still going on about that Neil Diamond? The guy sucks! He died 20 years ago. What'd you say? You heard what I said. Neil Diamond's all washed up. Hell, if you wanna talk singing Jews... talk Billy Joel! Billy'll kick Neil's ass! Washed up? Billy Joel kicks Neil's ass? What'd you call him? - Hey! Christ's sake! [overlapping shouting] It was August 24th, 1972 at the Greek! I was a great person, man! Did you ever listen to "Sweet Caroline"? Hey, cut it out! [overlapping shouting] Hey, hey, cut it out! Apologize to Neil! Apologize to Neil, man! Take it easy! Relax! - Take it easy! - Yeah, yeah. Just cool it, man! Okay? [overlapping chatter] Calm down. Come on. He's got this stuff... you know, about Neil Diamond. Neil got him through some rough patches in Vietnam. He takes it personal. - Shit! No kidding! Hey, Mike, I-I don't know what happened, I-I'm sorry. - That's okay, Phil. - Hey, are you okay? - I'm fine, just cool it. - I feel so stupid. Leave me alone, I'm fine. Okay, look, guys, come on. We need some fresh air. Let's get a breath of fresh air. Let's all go down to the pool. We'll sit there, we'll have a drink. We relax. Okay? - Yeah. Okay, let's come down. Okay? - We'll go get some tickets? - Yeah, come on. [speaking Bosnian] It, uh... looks like my coat caught something. I'll see you guys up there. Hey, uh, excuse me, uh... You girls, uh, fly for TWA? No. Who do you work for? For Pan Am. Oh, Pan American. I used to know a girl that used to work with Pan Am. Um... Uh, Pamela Roberts. Do you know her? No. Uh, well, she lived in Cincinnati. I was just wonderin'. - No. So, um, where are you girls headed to from here? New York. - Oh, New York, huh? - Mm-hmm. - The Big Apple, huh? - Uh huh. - Quite a life you girls lead. - Uh huh. And, uh, what do you do? Oh, me, I'm, uh... I'm in sales. Um... Real estate... It's industrial real estate. Warehouses, shopping malls, that type of stuff. It's all hush-hush now, though. Well, Mr. American, you want to buy me big house? - Would I-- - Phil, you coming? Uh, yeah, yeah, coming. I gotta run. - We're going. - Okay, I'm coming. Coming. I gotta go. Hey, maybe I'll see y'all later. You girls stayin' at this hotel? - Mm-hmm. - Well, ta ta. - Bye bye. [speaking Bosnian] [whispering] So what's the story with Stan? He thinks he's dying. Has he seen a doctor? Did he get a medical opinion? He says why confirm what he already knows. Oh, shit. Should I send him back? No. No, he'll be fine. A couple days R and R is just what the doctor ordered. Is he sleeping? No. He lies awake the whole night trying to piece together his past. He's what? He tryin' to remember his whole life. Every day, every week, every month, from his very first memory at the age of five. That's impossible. Not if one has a good memory. Geez... Right now he's up to his early teens, but he's starting to run against some gaps. It seems that, uh... He thinks that they're his good memories, but he can't remember 'em. It seems the bad parts really flow. It's really starting to get to him. Yeah. I imagine so. Hey, Bill, I'm sorry about Mikey. I don't know what happened. Don't apologize, will ya? Look, as far as I'm concerned, you shoulda smacked him up against the side of the head and knocked some sense into him for God's sakes. I'm sorry. So, um, what are you doin' this Christmas? Uh, we'll probably go to Patti's mom's in Fresno. That sounds exciting. And you? Oh, the wife wants to come here to Vegas, you know, with the kids. Here? Vegas? Oh, Jesus. Why do you complicate your life? I mean if you're gonna find misery in every miserable aspect of your miserable existence, at least rejoice in the misery. Revel in the wretchedness. You wanna know the secret to life, Stan? Huh? You wake up in the morning, you screw your wife, 'cause you're gonna be too pissed off later. Go to work, come home, watch some television, and go to bed. Anything on top of that is icing on the cake. Enjoy the pain. That's the secret. - Enjoy the pain? - Mm-hmm. Yeah, between me and you, Stan... ...you need to get into some serious masochism. Yeah. It'll change your life. There is no happier person in this world than a true masochist. - You really think so? - Mm. Think so? I know so! You could throw that hot coffee in my face, and I'd find a reason to enjoy it. Hey, stick the ketchup bottle up my ass, and I might even give you a little dance. [scoffs] You're so screwed up. Hey, check it out. Eyes at ten o'clock. What? Where? What? You don't recognize them?

[stammering] Which one's Holly Blonde? The one in the sweater. Hey, you got a pen? [stammering] What do you want a pen for? You-you're gonna ask her for an autograph? - Yeah, why not? - What for? She's famous. Famous for havin' a dildo stuck up her ass. That's the kinda fame I like. Hi, I'm Phil. That's Stan over there. Hi. How you doin'? [giggling] Nice to meet you, Stan. I got a pen if you girls would like to, uh... ...sign a napkin or something. Isn't it crazy here this weekend? It sure is. This is to Phil, right? - Uh, that's correct. - Oh, right.

This is- I need this scene. Okay? The motivation for the scene is pretty important. I mean, yes, we are shooting the scene, and if I don't get you kind of getting ass-fucked, then there's no point with you in the scene with the truck driver for tomorrow. You know what I'm saying?
