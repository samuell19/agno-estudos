Admiral Dozle! My ship is lost! Good luck, sir! - Iwo Jima destroyed! - Zé†«opek, engines offline! Admiral Dozle! Good hunting, sir! Sieg Zeon! I won't let your deaths be in vain! Don't let the valiant struggle of our rear guard ships be for nothing! Spread out, then come about! Hurry! This is a resounding victory for the Tianem Fleet. At this rate, there will be nothing for us to do. They're only Zeons... - Engine section hit! - Heavy damage to power reactor! Lights spotted! 3 o'clock, roughly 8 km ahead! No sign of enemy vessels! It's a humanoid mobile weapon that's attacking! Starboard side, put up a barrage! Denim, use this to fire from the enemy's rear. Slender, cover Denim. Yes, sir! But, Lieutenant, if you're alone... One is plenty for a diversion. It's too fast! Unable to engage! All hands, abandon ship! Can I take down two more? Five Magellan-class ships destroyed! Enemy is a single, red, mobile suit! Multiple intense heat sources closing in from below! Mobile suits! Engaging enemy! All hands, put on normal suits! Launch attackers! Wow, it's fast! Who is that? - I couldn't see it. - A red suit means it's Lt. Char. The Ananke, huh? That's Revil's ship, isn't it? I'll finish her off! - All gun ports offline! - All hands, abandon ship! - That bastard's fast... - Char, you mean? That's triple normal speed... The guy's a veritable red comet. One round left, eh? MOBILE SUIT GUNDAM THE ORIGIN I At last, it's finished! My draft for tomorrow's speech is done! Read it and see what you think, Astraia. Go on! Shh! You're shouting, dear. You'll wake the children. It's wrong! This is all wrong... This is just a demand for more autonomy! That isn't what I want to say! This speech is to be a declaration of war to all who live in the Earth Sphere! But I just can't find the words... You're exhausted. Rest for a while. All right? Lie down for a bit, and... Are you telling me to go to sleep? If I sleep, how will I be able to rouse my disciples? Astraia, tomorrow, I will be dragged away to Golgotha to be executed. And I will address the world from atop my cross. I will warn them that those sinners who incur the wrath of Gaia will soon be engulfed in hellfire and be annihilated! Please, rest! If only for a little while! The children? Fast asleep. After all, it's the middle of the night. No! You mustn't! Please don't disturb the children! Who is it...? Father? I'm so sleepy... Your beard is all scratchy. Good night, Father... Good night, Artesia. You're a sweet child. Good night. Good night... Blue-Eyed Casval Side 3 Autonomous Republic of Munzo Diet Chairman Zeon Zum Deikun's address is about to begin. Will he declare independence from the Federation? The eyes of the world are on him. Please stop! Father is sick? Don't worry, Artesia. I'm sure that it's nothing. Deikun! Deikun! Deikun! Deikun! Deikun! Deikun! No! Deikun! Deikun! Deikun! - Send out the Chairman! - What happened to Deikun?! Don't put up with the Federation's tyranny! Do you know how much we're suffering?! Let us hear the Chairman's speech! Independence! The Chairman had a sudden heart attack. First aid was administered to no avail. Before he passed on, he said to me, "Please look after Astraia and the children." Feel free to turn to me for anything you require. As Deikun's oldest comrade, I, Degwin Zabi, place my entire family at your service. It is most reassuring to hear such kind words from a Zabi. Deikun's been assassinated! He was murdered! By the Federation! The Federation is Deikun's enemy! The Federation security force has been mobilized! The streets around the capitol are packed with protesters, and there is no way for us to leave! Lady Astraia, if I may have a word? You mustn't trust that Degwin! Zabi loyalists might be behind Deikun's assassination! Surely not! No! I am certain of it! Protestors are rioting outside! Why is that?! Deikun's death is supposed to be a secret! Someone leaked the news! Their second son, Sasro, had a hand in it, I'd wager! Degwin has been trying to get Deikun out of the way for ages. And that is why he poisoned him! Mr. Ral, please! Not in front of the children... No! It is the children above all who must know! Your father was assassinated! By those Zabi fiends! We must act with the utmost caution. First, we must get you to my home. Hey! This is my son, Ramba Ral. He will lead the way. Please consider him your personal guard. It will be my honor, madam! To think I may be of service to the Deikuns! Halt! Emergency evacuation of the Chairman's family! Coming through! Good! Take the detour to the left that's coming up! All the way out here, too... - We're not scared! - You think you're hot stuff? Try it! Clear the road! Dammit, get out of our way! - Check out that car! - Who's in it? Who is it? Who is it? Wow, it's Deikun's family! It's Astraia! It's Casval! Artesia, too! Listen up! I mean it, I'm going to gun you down! You seem to be in a spot of trouble, Capt. Ramba Ral! Kycilia Zabi... May I render assistance? You won't owe me anything. You're Miss Kycilia, aren't you? Yes. Is everyone all right? Yes, thank you. Goodness, you cut quite the dashing figure. "For a woman", do you mean to say? It is the way of the Zabi family. Laugh if you wish. And then you let them slip through your fingers?! Yes. I thought it would be childish to squabble with Ramba Ral over those three. You allowed him to snatch Deikun's orphaned children from under your nose! You fool! Sasro! - You didn't have to hit her! - Not a word out of you! Just when my public opinion manipulation was starting to make everyone think that Deikun's death was a Federation assassination! You fell for that old fool's scheme! Elimination is our only option. I'm referring to the doddering old fool. Meaning? We deliver the final blow to the Ral family. Once and for all. Zeon Zum Deikun, embodiment of our ideals and leader of glorious Munzo. As chairman of the Munzo Diet, he was a trailblazer for Spacenoid liberation, and now, as he ascends into the cosmos, he is becoming the very cornerstone of that ideal. May his soul be at rest and inspire eternal justice. May his ideals live forever. Though his flesh may have perished, may he cast his light upon our path and show us the way. Sieg Zeon. Sasro, you went too far. What? You mean Kycilia? Yeah. You didn't have to go and slap her. I should have done more than that! She's been too full of herself lately! Well, that's true. But we're family, so we ought to try to... Dozle! That soft heart of yours is a liability! Listen! The political situation here is about to turn into a bloodbath! You'll never survive if you don't... Kycilia! The car Dozle and Sasro were in, it... Garma! Don't let a little thing like this rattle you! You're a man of the Zabi family, aren't you?! Put it out! Put it out! It's going to explode! Crap! Sasro's been murdered! Who did this?! Who's the bastard who's behind this?! - Who's the bastard who's behind this?! - Wait, don't shoot! Who's the bastard who's behind this?! A car in Zeon Zum Deikun's funeral procession exploded without warning. Of its passengers, Sasro Zabi was killed, and Dozle Zabi miraculously escaped life-threatening injuries. Lies and slander! The stinking media, always doing the Zabis' bidding! This is part of Degwin's plot! He's trying to distract the public from Deikun's assassination by killing his own son and making it look like we did it! Is that true, Dad? Ramba! What's this?! Do you suspect me, too?! No, I didn't mean that. But could he kill his own son for such a reason? Sasro was a right bastard, but he was good at his job, and the other Zabis thought highly of him. Mr. Ramba. Lady Astraia is asking for you. I'll be right there! - Damn it all! - Get out here, old man! Murderer! Sasro-killer! You abducted Deikun's family! That's playing dirty! You sleazy old fart! You're a disgrace to Deikun's memory, you traitor! It's Capt. Ral, madam! I'm coming in! I understand perfectly! You wish to go home? Of course you do! Of course you do! However, I ask that you wait a little longer... No, Captain. She is crying because... Lucifer is all alone... I'm worried. Lucifer? A cat?! A cat, Miss? Lucifer gets lonely really easily. He can't fall asleep unless I hold him, and he can't even go potty unless I help him! I understand! Uncle will bring Lucifer to you! Really?! Yes, I give you my word. There's nothing that Uncle Ramba Ral can't do! Uncle Ramba, you're the best! Commence Operation: Rescue Lucifer! - Lucifer? - Who's that? Beats me... - Lieutenant! What's your name? - Sir! Donovan Matgloss, sir! Put together a platoon and follow me! Oh no! I forgot to tell him that Lucifer scratches people he doesn't know! Zabi! Zabi! Zabi! Don't let the traitors get away with it! Crush the Rals! Long live Degwin Zabi! Kill all the Rals! - Awesome! - That's for Sasro! Zabi! Zabi! Zabi! Zabi! Zabi! We've beaten the Ral family. The city has descended into anarchy. It's not enough to simply fan the flames. It's about time that we restored order. That's your name that the mob is shouting. Be that as it may, I cannot push them. It would give the Federation the pretext they've been waiting for. Gihren! Father! So this is where you are! Oh my, this is so much fun, watching the Ral family fall! Dozle, should you be up and around? I can't stay in bed, not when I'm this worked up! I'll settle the score for Sasro with my own two hands! Need I remind you, a cornered mouse will bite the cat. It's true that Jimba Ral is already a dead man walking, but there's still his son, Ramba. He seems to be quite popular among the younger members of the Munzo Defense Force. Gihren, my boy, you need to master the art of duplicity. You're right, Ramba Ral is a good man. If he wasn't a Ral, I'd want to have him serving under me. Give them a way out. It is the prerogative of the victor to be magnanimous. Deikun and Jimba Ral are both men of the past now. The Zabi family alone will shoulder the responsibility of the history to come. Hold it right there, buddy! Which side are you with?! You better not be a Ral loyalist. Ugh, pee-yew! What's this guy been drinking?! Two sheets to the wind, and you're after a third? Do you know what today is, Pops?! I'm sorry, sir! The bar is already closed for the night, so... Captain? Is that you?! Keep your voice down, Lt... Tachi, was it? You moonlight as a club bouncer? N-No, sir! Things looked pretty bad tonight, so I volunteered! Honest! W-With all due respect, sir! Please don't drag her into any dangerous business! Please stop exploiting her and let her live a quiet, ordinary life. Lt. Tachi, this is an order. Don't stick your nose into what I'm about to do! Hey, good to see you, Captain! Clamp. Every time I see you, you look more at home behind that bar. How about it? You coming back to the military? The military? I don't feel like being a Federation lackey. But if you ever need me, Captain, I'll come running. Miss Hamon! You've been requested! Come inside. Bartender, don't let anyone in. Goodness, your disguise today is even more elaborate than usual. You missed some. It isn't makeup. That little Lucifer did a number on me. Gallivanting around at a time like this? So, what's this latest conquest like? A raven-haired... ... nimble little fiend! I'm sorry, Hamon, but I need you to do me another favor. I want to smuggle someone to Earth. Your father, Jimba Ral? You catch on quick, same as ever. After Sasro, the old man will never make it out of this alive. I couldn't bear to see him fall into the Zabis' hands. What about you? I'll come up with something. I'm confident that I'll find something to hold over them. So your father... will be the only one going to Earth? About that... He might be traveling with even peskier passengers. Who? Don't make me spell it out. You've already put two and two together. Well... If I use my connections at the Port Authority, I can make it work! I knew I could count on you! - That lieutenant is here again. - Yes. You shouldn't string along a naive guy like him. - You shouldn't string along a naive guy like him. - Okay, okay. Now that you mention it, he's stationed at the docking bay now! He might prove useful! Who, him? Why did those poor children have to be born into this world as Deikun's progeny? Halt! Don't come any closer! Take another step, and we'll fire! Go ahead and try, I dare you! State Security Police commander Kycilia Zabi is here on a special errand! Nothing doing! Mr. Jimba Ral will not see any member of the Zabi family! That's fine! I have no need to see Jimba Ral at this point! I wish to speak with Casval Rem Deikun on behalf of Degwin Zabi, the new chairman! With Casval, you say?! Never! Send her away! What, you already let her in?! You fools! Where is Ramba?! What?! He went into town to drink?! At a time like this?! That wastrel ingrate of a son! I will meet with that woman. If she says her name is Kycilia, I know her. She's intimidating, isn't she? But I won't be intimidated by a Zabi, the people who murdered Father. Oh, dear, I've woken you. You must think me terribly rude to call on you so late at night. However, this is an important matter. Something only you and I can do. At this moment, there is fighting in the city, and many people are being killed or injured. How have we found ourselves in this situation? It is because Jimba Ral murdered my brother, Sasro. And the reason that Sasro was killed is because your family took shelter in this house. But didn't all this begin when your family murdered my father? And who told you that? Your mother? No, not her. Jimba Ral put that idea in your head, didn't he? Miss Kycilia. Didn't you want to have a discussion? If all you want to do is scold me like some child, I won't stand for it! I'm going back to my room. I see. I apologize. Let's return to our discussion, then. I have a proposal. Go on. Your family has a home. A mansion prepared especially for the Deikun family. Return to that home. Just you three. Do so, and there will be no retaliation for Sasro. We will also calm the situation in the city. No! He can't do that! It's obviously a trap! If the three of them leave, the Zabis will slaughter the entire Ral family! Stand aside! Let me in! Mommy, where's Casval? If you truly give me your word, we will go home. However... However? You say that you're willing to overlook what happened to Mr. Sasro. But if that's the case, what about the fact that you murdered my father?! I'll never overlook that! I'm going to... You're still going on about that! I hear noises inside! It's gone quiet... Casval's in danger! Open the door! Ah, wait a moment, sir! I hear talking... I expected you to shout for help. Why didn't you cry out? You're more than welcome to call for help. Or is it that you aren't afraid of me? If you think that no one will harm you, you're quite mistaken, little lord Casval. How do you like that? I can even slap cuffs on you. I can throw you in a cell as a criminal if I want. Isn't that scary? Say that you're afraid! I'm not afraid. I'm Deikun's son. No one can do this to me! Degwin Zabi is now the most powerful man in the nation! If Degwin orders it, I can tie you up hand and foot! Still, I am the son of Zeon Zum Deikun. I'll grow up and make Degwin and the rest of you bow down to me! Casval Rem Deikun orders you! Take these off me! I must say, Casval is formidable. I pressed him hard to test him, but not only was he unafraid, he threatened me. He may be only 11 like our Garma, but the boy has guts. If you intend to found a thousand-year Zabi dynasty, you need to deal with him! That almost sounded as if you were giving me an order, Kycilia. I wouldn't dream of it. I merely hoped to correct my past mistake. I've given all these matters plenty of thought. Do not interfere! But with Sasro gone... "Leave the scheming to me," is that it? Don't make me laugh. Rather than scheming, I suggest you pray for the repose of Sasro's soul instead. Chairman's Residence Oh, I had no idea that you had returned, Madam Roselucia. Of course. This is my home, after all. Yes. Of course it is. It's too noisy here for us to talk. Let's have a chat somewhere quiet. Come to my room later. By yourself! You will move into the tower. Very well. The tower is not so bad. Aside from it being more cramped and lonelier at night. It was originally built as a place for contemplation. Who knows how many of Deikun's ideas were birthed within its walls? It is imbued with the many feelings of us 2nd-generation colonists. Our suffering, our sadness, our hopes. Our dark resentment. How fortunate you are. After all, you bore Deikun's children. You, a mere nightclub singer using your feminine wiles... With all due respect, Madam Roselucia, I have raised both Casval and Artesia into fine young children. Ones who will do Deikun's name proud when they follow in his footsteps! Listen to you, sounding so haughty! But tell me this! What does "the reformation of humanity" refer to?! Tell me! How have Spacenoids changed? How are they different from Earthnoids?! Why is it that man mustn't continue living on Earth?! You can't answer! As if you could ever understand! When we were young, we would often gather around Deikun to debate. How I miss those days... I did anything that Deikun asked of me! The only thing I could not do was give him children! But what of it?! Only children! Just because I couldn't give him children! Why did I have to lose out to a whore like you?! Someone... Madam Roselucia! Hold on! Take calm breaths! Your medicine! Here, madam, drink it! Excuse me, Madam Roselucia... Will the children be joining me in the tower? I can't very well allow the heirs of the Deikun family to live there. Not in a place like that. But they may spend this one night with you. As a special gift from me. What the hell is this? What's going on with our security?! Butler! Isn't anyone here?! Damn it all... Everyone left in a hurry when they saw which way the wind was blowing. Mr. Ral. A message for you. What?! "Astraia sent to tower. "Family together tonight only. Must act now..." Who sent this?! Shall I take care of it? Hamon, huh? That's a terrible prank. That intel is no prank. Astraia will be held under strict house arrest in that tower from now on. Extracting her will be impossible. Your decision, please. What are the odds of the Zabis waiting for the children to grow and letting them rise to power? None at all. 300% against. This just isn't doable without similar odds in our favor. But can you do it? Can you get them to the docking bay? Not to worry. I have a foolproof means of delivery. Dad! O-Oh, it's you. What have you been up to at a time like this?! Good grief. You and your pointless resistance. They won't take me without a fight! If I get the chance, I'll take Degwin with me! Dad, never mind that. I've made arrangements for you to flee to Earth. What?! You have?! The people I've lined up will see to everything. That's my boy! Thank you so much! That's why you're the Ral family heir! Once you get to Earth, it's up to you what to do with yourself. You can worry about those of us who stay here. Or don't worry. Whatever you choose, I guess whatever will happen will happen. Is this our new house? I call dibs! I like this house! It's way better than that dumb house with that scary old witch in it! Though the hallways are kinda dark, and the yard is kinda small and dirty. But I'll help clean it up, so it's okay! Right, Mommy? Artesia, don't run around so much. Lucifer! Come here! Quiet down, Artesia. Join us, Casval. I have something... very important to tell you. Hush! Not so loud! No one must hear us! If those scary people find out, we are all done for! Why aren't you coming, Mommy? Why? I don't want to go without you! No, no, no, I won't go to Earth! I won't go if you're not coming with us, Mommy! I'm sorry, Artesia, I didn't express myself clearly. I'm going to join you later. I can't go with you now, that's all. Then... when? When will you come? C'mon, when? When you've become a good girl on Earth. No, not like that! Promise right! Or I won't be a good girl! Oh, dear. I'm sorry. Let's do this, then. On Earth, you can see stars in the sky. The biggest and roundest of them is the Moon. Count each time it shrinks down to half, grows thin, and then grows round again. When it does that 100 times, that's when I will come. So wait for me, all right? The Moon will grow round 100 times? That's right, 100 times. Can you count that high? One, two, three, four, five, six... - Seven, eight, nine, ten... - Miss Astraia! It's cold, so come in! It's all well and good for you, but think of the health - ... thirteen... - of those precious children! A hundred times... When the Moon grows round 100 times, you promise? Earth is a beautiful place. The sky is blue, and it has mountains and forests. We have forests in Munzo. Yes, but Earth's forests are filled with all sorts of animals. What kinds of animals? Please go to sleep. It's very late. I want to talk more. Aren't you sleepy? I'm sleepy, but I don't want to go to sleep. If I did, it would be morning right away. I hate the morning. I don't want morning to come! I want it to stay night like this forever. But then you wouldn't be able to count the Moon. Well, yeah, but... You mustn't stay the way you are now forever. You're a growing girl, aren't you? You have to grow up to be a fine person and make lots and lots of people happy. Okay? - Whoa, what the hell?! - Halt! Stop right there! I am here to take custody of the two orphaned children of Zeon Zum Deikun as a special mission for the Federation Munzo Garrison Force! Hand them over immediately! - Did you hear anything about this? - News to me... You're refusing an order?! I'll have you in front of a court martial! W-Wait a minute! We're calling it in now! You are Miss Artesia and Master Casval, I take it? I've come for you! H-Hey, check in with the Federation garrison! Hurry! You are Miss Crowley Hamon? Good, your mother has explained. I am. Go on, climb aboard! W-W-Wait a minute! Hello? This is an emergency! Hello? This is the chairman's residence! Hello?! Hello?! All right, back us up! Bring us about 180 degrees! Hello?! Hello?! Mommy! Get changed. Into these! They're a little grungy, but don't make a fuss, okay? Driver! Hurry! Go faster! So, Miss Fake Lieutenant. You're hiding something about those two kids up top, aren't you? You know, I think we undersold our services. Oh? I think that 20,000, including fuel costs, to take us to the cargo center is hardly a cheap fare for the ride. All right, I'll add 10,000! How does that sound? We won't accept less than double. But if you don't have that much, well... Well what? You're more than welcome to pay with your body. How does that sound? Pig! Put that down! You know what would happen if you fired a gun in here, don't you?! Now, take those controls! What do you mean, a Guntank is running out of control?! Intolerable! I won't stand for it! Target is proceeding along the rotation axis! It might be heading for the docking bay! Stop it! Immediately! Head straight down the main street! We'll take the shortest route! What?! A Federation vehicle took Casval and Artesia?! It... couldn't be! Captain, Miss Hamon's part of the plan was a success! She's something else. It's a crying shame that she's a woman. Right, then! Let's get to work, too! Hey! Watch where you're going, dammit! Gosh, I'm ever so sorry! Hey, back it up! Huh? What? You've got a flat? What lousy luck! Be quick about it! I'll run you over! What are you doing?! I told you to hurry it up! What? You don't have a spare? I guess we'll have to wait for a tow truck, then! - What are you doing? Move! - Just get that mess cleaned up! This is no time to be dragging your feet! How long will this take?! Finish up, dammit! They're here! They've come for us! This is why I didn't want to do it! Destroy them! Do that, and I'll double what I'm paying you! We can't win! There's four of them! Weakling! Stand aside! What are those? The enemy! My enemy, your enemy, Mother's enemy, everyone's! I'll take them out! It can be fired from up here, too... Safeties, disengaged... P-Please don't! If you fire that, we'll get the firing squad! You can keep your money! Oh, shut up! Stop bothering me! I-It opened fire! Return fire! Return fire! Stop firing! Please! It wasn't me! It was... The boy up there?! Earth is a beautiful place. The sky is blue, and it has mountains and forests. We have forests in Munzo. Yes, but Earth's forests are filled with all sorts of animals. What kinds of animals? You mustn't stay the way you are now forever. You're a growing girl, aren't you? You have to grow up to be a fine person and make lots and lots of people happy. Okay? Stop, Casval! Those poor people... Federation tanks are exchanging fire! A battle has broken out on 7th Avenue! Federation tanks are exchanging fire! - Federation tanks are exchanging fire! - This is bad... Dammit, Hamon! You're taking this too far! - Proceeding north on 7th Avenue! - It's slowed down! It will reach the blockade line soon! Stand by to fire and destroy it! - Roger that! - Not so fast! What?! Major Dozle Zabi, Munzo Defense Force, Capital Banchi Command Center! I-Is there a problem? The children of the republic's late chairman are aboard that thing! You mustn't attack it! You must wait until after they've been rescued! U-Understood, Major! I'll call it in now... That is what he says, sir! Sir? That isn't any of the Federation's concern, sir? Destroy the rebel vehicle immediately? That's what my superiors say, Major. What?! I won't take this lying down! You will not harm the orphaned children of Zeon Zum Deikun! U-Uh, s-s-s-sir...? It's for me? Yes, it's me. Take no action on your own. Just wait and see how it plays out. Deikun's children? Leave them be, too. Yes? I don't care. We're getting out, you two! A lot more are on the way! That's good, all this smoke is acting as a screen. Wait for us! Take us with you! I've set the controls to auto, so it should keep going straight ahead! We're jumping down! Ready?! I'll catch you! Jump as hard as you can! Come on! Hurry! Hurry! RTX-65 closing in! Distance, 2,000! Still no response to our orders to stop! All right, prepare to...! Major Dozle, may we attack... sir? Um... Yeah. Sir! In that case... Prepare to fire! Fire! Hey, taxi! Where are you headed, miss? Oh, as if you don't know! Take us to the cargo terminal, please. Almost entirely according to plan. Don't you agree? I suppose. Lt. Tachi! Can we close this last container? Wait! There's one more! I mean, just a little longer! Ow! Ouch... This is intolerable, treating people like cargo... I suppose we are cargo... Then we'll just have to bear with it. That's how it is, so try not to say a word. Cargo doesn't talk, you see. Shh! They'll hear you! Okay! That's the last one! Go ahead and load it up! It's fragile, so be gentle with it! - That stupid little... - It's all right. He gets the job done. He is a bit hapless, though. Wait! What are you doing?! I thought I'd run an HF tomography check to be safe. Don't! Are you saying you don't trust my inspection?! I'm the officer in charge here! If you don't put it on board soon, the ship will leave without it! - Shh! - No meowing, Lucifer! A cat?! In here! Of course not! Over there! Wow, it's a cat! It's a cat! Here, kitty, kitty! Gosh, where did you go? Here, kitty! Oh, brother. We can relax for now... I don't think that's going to be the case. That was a clever bit of work, but do you think you've won, Capt. Ral? I could stop all cargo flights right now on my authority and have everything in them rechecked. Yes, but I don't think our kindhearted Cdr. Kycilia would do anything quite so drastic. Why, thank you, Captain. You're a fine judge of character. But I'm going to bring you before the proper authorities, of course. Of course. We'll obey your summons like meek little lambs. - Gate 3, open! - Flight 103, clear for departure! Gate 1, course is clear. Ocean Cargo 008, you may exit when ready. 008, proceed to taxiway! Roger! Activating auxiliary engines! The ship is leaving... Dead slow ahead. Course is clear. It's safe to go out now. Not yet! Stay put! We're inside a container... Let's go! Listen, Young Mas... The capsule and container can both be opened from the inside. It will be cold in the cargo hold, but try to endure it, okay? Casval... My body is floating, it feels kinda strange. We're in zero-G. In space, you don't weigh anything. The terminal at Granada is packed, so be prepared for delays. Thanks for the heads-up. Once the ship leaves port, look out the window.

Miss Hamon, tell my mommy something for me, okay? "I'll be a good girl on Earth "and I'm gonna count until the Moon grows round 100 times. "When it does, make sure you come. 'Cause I'll be waiting."
