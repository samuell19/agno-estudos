Wake up, honey. You'd better remember That an empty glass Is full of air You'd better remember That the dark air... Good morning Batista, you jerk. Morning, Mrs. Nobody. Don't, will ya? Don't! Jerk! Go to Hell! That's what you deserve. Look at mommy. Wanna hose me down? Go ahead! There! I'm soaking wet! You'd better remember That an empty glass Today only if you pay for it, ma'am. Pay? Over my dead body. A bunch of disgrace. That disgrace is not gratis. Let's not bicker. What for? Hey, Mrs. Nobody. - I'm tempted. - Go ahead. My pleasure. Bottoms up. And my bologna sandwich? Come back after 6pm. Deal. The kid cried all night. And all his mom cares about is raising the kid's rental rate. You're a heroine. It's so good to see you, you! Can you spare me some change? I need a bath. I got hosed down with a stinky water. A buck or two. I'll pay you back. Spare me some, come on! Excuse me, ma'am! No teeth-brushing there. Morning, Officer. The water is terrific. Refreshing. Leave, please. I mean it. - Or l'll take you in. - Please. Harassing people, to arrest them, Officer? That's not healthy. What else can l be? A pilot! See? A 3-day rest period between 1-night shifts. Life is short. Enjoy it, Officer. Or die. And who's gonna protect the city against crime? You? Definitely not the Police. Over there Downtown... those white-collared men. You should begin with them. From the cream of the crop. Sure, along with you, ma'am. - No teeth-brushing. - I've done no harm. - Leave. - Come on. - No! - Leave her alone! Fucker! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!!! Miserable bitch! You're past due for a good shower, son. Grandma. Grandma? It's me. Leandro. No. My folks said you'd died, grandma. To your family, l'm dead. Look. Look... Look at that... l've tagged you since early today. You sleep on the streets. Why? I'm used to it. Used to it? Grandma, you had a home, a bed. You were a teacher. I don't get it. And you don't have to. I want to live on the streets. As simple as that. So? What's the problem? None. l just find it all very confusing. It's not confusing at all. Come with me. Come on. I'm inviting you. No, no. You come with me, grandma. I'm gonna call the day off. You're coming with me. No. I need a shower, son. At the fountain? Well... "If it's dirty, clean it." You sounded just like my mom now. Do not compare me with you mother. - For God's sake. - Why not? I'm sure she thinks, as l bet you do, that life is... Things are more complicated than they really are. That's it. Life is simple. There's no mystery. At all. - Your pitch is illogical. - Why? You pay for electricity, water, phone, Internet... trash! HOA fees... HOA fees! I don't pay a thing. Zilch! I pay for zilch! I like the streets. It's my home. - Remember our home? - Of course. Remember the two of us couch-potating? No. I sat on the floor. - C'mon. - I hated that couch! Never liked couches. Grandma! I don't like living at home. Birthday parties for grandmas, grandpas, mothers, fathers. God forbid. No. - I might come off as insane. - Like you do now. The thing is I like people! I like the streets. Of this city, dear. But you're filthy, grandma. Such is life. You've got nowhere to shower. How dare you? Who says I don't? Who says I don't, boy?! Wine occupies Ipain's place Come on! Come on in, son! Come on! Come on! Don't be silly! Come! Half-full, Half-empty Half sadness, Halfjoy The magic of the whole truth, Our almighty love You'd better remember That an empty glass Is full of air You know what day today is, bro? The 3rd anniversary of the day she left me. Miserable bitch. I still love her, man. This is her. I've put some of her perfume on the photo. Here. But it's not the same. Hey! What the hell? Perfume is a trap. Perfume is a trap in the air. I should've forgiven her. - Hey, the flowers! - Sorry. - How are you? - Man! You've turned grey. Yeah, time flies, right? - Good to see you. - Yeah. - Your daughter? - Yeah. My baby girl. - So cute. - She is. Very. - This is my wife. - Nice to meet you. - I'm Felicia. - Felicia? Really? It's our daughter's name. Oh yeah? Yeah. Yeah? C?lio, you're scheduled to escort Jai Arnott during the Festival. Pick him up at the airport. Jai Arnott, the actor? Yeah. That's him. Pick him up at the airport, ok? Sure. Will do. Like it? Yeah. l like it a lot. Good size, right? Great size. It's expensive, right? Maybe. But... l think it's worth it. Hi, love! Hi, my muse. What's up? How did you like the place? I like it a lot. It's great. I'm gonna send you a pic, ok? - Ok, love ya. - Me too. Do you speak Portuguese? Prison 1, Prison 2. Is that Justin Bieber?

In all the chats we have About affairs, or whatever So much in common Confiding secrets I don't know when to say it I feel afraid So afraid I need to tell you I love you To win you or lose you Without fail I need to tell you I love you so much! I need to tell you I love you To win you or lose you Without fail I need to tell you I love you so much... When there is no more love Its remains are left A few feeble oaths In permanent marker Hair strands on a jacket When there is no more love There remains a few things A few common mists A few common secrets By a big pink house When there is no more love There remains the horror A torrent of insults And blood perjuries Doors in the wind And the lover's fear When there is no more love There remains a few things A few common mists A few common secrets By a big pink house When there is no more love There remains the horror A torrent of insults And blood perjuries Doors in the wind And the lover's fear No more ocean view The same linear future It's the winter of love Ordinary, so ordinary One single wrong word For a stone-throwing attack It's the winter of love Seaside, so ordinary So ordinary When there is no more love There remains the tenderness And sometimes we get drunk On cheap wine to survive A moment that leave us Even less full of love Suddenly, all oppresses us When there is no more love There remains two hostages Almost two lions in a cage Dreaming of other shores Other shores No more ocean view The same linear future It's the winter of love Ordinary, so ordinary One single wrong word For a stone-throwing attack It's the winter of love Ordinary, so ordinary When there is no more love... BOXER "TEXAS" FRAYJO AND WIFE MARIA SlLVA'S TRAGlC CAR ACCIDENT Professional bout, Texas? You gotta be kidding me. There's no professional bouts with one-armed boxers. I need $80,000. $80,000, Texas? Everybody needs $80,000, including me. Up, up! It's for Maria's operation. The doctor says she might walk again. You should've considered this before drinking and driving. Now deal with it. Shoulder that responsibility. Look, I know how to find you something. What the fuck, William? Is this a fucking joke, dog? It's no joke, man. He's my boxer. - Are you Jo?o Frayjo "Texas"? - That's me. Keep your guard up, damn it! - R$ 500? - Don't you need 80 grand? This is just the beginning, champ. It must begin somehow. This is the champion! Thank you, buddy. Texas... a gringo wants to speak with you, let's go. The gringo wants to make you an offer. Straight talk. He knows your wife needs an operation. He's saying... you two should fight. If you win, he'll pay for her surgery and treatment. If you lose, he'll pay for her surgery and treatment just as well. He lost me. His wife died a while back. She was pregnant and died at childbirth along with their son. He saw magazine photos of your wife... and she looks just like his. Same name, Maria. So he'll pay for her recovery. When she's well, he'll take her to his home... where they'll have sex until she gets pregnant. Once the child is born, your wife comes back. But he keeps the child, got it? Hey! Calm down! Calm down. I'm gonna kill you! Gotcha! Guys, listen up! See this cute guy here? A thief! He used my services and didn't pay. Thief. You've bitten me, are you crazy? I'm not, but I'll get crazy now if you don't pay up. - Pay up. - You tried to bite me... Hi, mom, any goals? Brazilian passports are worth top money in the black market. Really? Why? 'Cause only here you'll find all skin tones. White, black, milk chocolate... Easterners, lndians, you name it. Brazil has people of all skin tones, know what I mean? Of course! We all understand Portuguese. Your neighboring countries have mostly white populations, why? 'Cause in the past white men decimated other races. Not in Brazil. Why don't you stop with your idiotic stories and start doing something? What? So you're seeing Isabel today? Tell her l said "hi". And that I've prepared this for her. Isabel... Oh, Isabel... She's an angel that sleeps with men like you for free. Shameless son of a bitch. Fernando... Fernando! I got my Visa. I'm going to New York. You? You don't even speak English. Come, Fernando. I'm so thirsty! Thirsty for your damn blood! So thirsty! For your damn blood so thirsty Buddies, disperse! Whore! Let's do it. Hold it up. I would go. If l were you, I'd go. We're lucky l was the one invited. Anybody would! No one would think twice. - I get it. - It's the chance of a lifetime! I get it. You must take the offer. The rest takes care of itself. The rest? Everybody, line up! - Come with me. - It's you they want. - I'm not going without you. - For God's sake! I'm fine here. There's something l didn't tell you. You're only here because l asked. What's going on? Go on! Go. I'd have a place here without you. Not as good, but still. You've always had one. I remember being someone without you. I remember falling in love. Head over heels? Head over heels. I'm at a place you made up. And you made up my need to go. - I'm staying. - I'm leaving. - Then take me with you. - Where to? To the last place that used to be yours. That was when we first met. I still live that moment. That's where we'll start over. But what for? Why so much sky? Why so much sea? What for? What's the use Of this wave that breaks? With the afternoon wind? What's the use Of the afternoon? Useless landscape It may be so That you won't come anymore That you'll never Come anymore What's the use of the flowers That grow along the path If my path Alone is nothing? What's the use of the flowers That grow along the path If my path Alone is nothing? Nothing So? Won't you say you're sorry? You never helped me with Clara. It's all a lie. Your open arms are also just a lie. This city is a lie! Have you been down there? You never go down there. Down there there is no love, so you stay here. The Police is killing people, when it rains it's a mess, everybody dies... Children don't have schools. But up here it's better to see, isn't it? You know what? I'm leaving! Wonderful city my ass!
