RAW protects India from the outside. IB and police protect it from within. Borders are guarded by Army, Air Force and Navy. Only one entity coordinates them all. Trinetra. In South India, amongst the 40,000 applications RAW received last year 800 members were up for selections In that, only six of them were selected for Trinetra. So, what is Trinetra? RAW doesn't function in India. IB cannot operate outside India. Trinetra has no boundary. We can operate from anywhere because nobody knows we exist. No one knows our existance.

Our best officer who was investigating it was killed. After that Trinetra shut down. With the terrorist attacks in Mumbai... ..our Prime Minister realized enemies are amidst us. He felt the need for Trinetra again. we had bases only in Delhi and Mumbai till yesterday. Today, Trinetra is in Hyderabad too. What else? I mean You're telling us all such secrets.

The truth about me is in this locker. That's why this locker is in the name of Gopi. That's because Gopi does not exist to the world. Sameera, I wasn't born on the 12th of June. My dad in my hometown is not my dad. It's my uncle. My uncle raised me. But I grew up missing my dad. I know how it feels to be missing parents and pretending happy to the world. You came into my life, made me smile and fall in love. I love you now. That's why I can't hide it anymore. Sameera, love means giving the other person the ability to destroy your soul. But trusting them not to. I trust you. And I love you. My birthday is 19th August. My name is. Gopi. Gopi? Couldn't they find a better name? [Chuckles] [Instrumental music] It's all right.

[Siren] Gopi, run. Listen to me, Gopi. Run! [Siren] [Tyres screeching] [Music] [Footsteps] [Foot steps] [Foot steps] Move. Move. [Elevator sound] [Unlocking the door] [Device squeaks] [Device beeping] [Device beeping] [Device beeping] [Blast] [Siren] [Car ignition] [Music] [Phone vibrating] Hmm. He escaped. Not a single scratch on him. [Roaring] Tell me. OK. Maâ€™am! Ten of our agents are killed. Arjun blew up his apartment and escaped. -OK. - Sir found this gun at the crime spot. Send the forensic team to the crime scene and keep it confidential. [Door opens] [Machine beeping] Itâ€™s Arjun. No, maâ€™am. Arjun called me at the same time. And tried to warn me. Please tell Arjun. The mission was always important for me too. Sorry, maâ€™am! I couldnâ€™t save Aacharya. Aacharya? [Machine beeping] [Door opens] He tried to talk, but didnâ€™t tell anything. Go to Arjunâ€™s apartment immediately and start the investigation. -Okay maâ€™am. -Go. [Message tone] [Birds quacking] [Music] -Trace the vehicle ownerâ€™s information. -Yes sir. - Maâ€™am! - What do we have? Arjun tried to escape in this vehicle. We suspect he killed Aacharya and came home in this school van. What about this video? We found this on traffic signals CCTV footage. Arjunâ€™s fingerprints are traced on this gun. Maâ€™am! Itâ€™s clear, Arjun is the prime suspect. Maâ€™am! PM secretary is on line. OK. [Notification tone] I was told, he is one of you. Yes, Sir. Do you even realise how serious the situation is? Whose side is he on? Ma'am, Arjunâ€™s account was credited with 2 crores rupees an hour before the attack. He got calls from an encrypted phone at the same time. But, nothing has been traced. Not only that, There were calls made to Karachi and Dhaka from a satellite phone found at his home. Pakistan? [Music] You taught him to disappear. You taught him to hide. You taught eveyrthing. Listen! I donâ€™t know what you'd do. But, find him! Alright! Cut his financial access. Freeze all his bank accounts. [Machine beeping] Block all his debit and credit cards. Inform immediately to all national and state highways. Initiate checkpoints. Hey stop. Pull over. Airports, police stations and all railway stations. Notify Interpol.

Welcome. [Train honking] M. Arjun Kumar who is accused of this barbarity will be found and punished. Warrants were already issued from the prime ministerâ€™s office. The accused blasted his house before the escape and his girlfriend is found dead. This incident took four other lives along with her. The Bureau suspects them to be his followers. [People canvassing] [Rewinding video] [Indistinct people conversation] Do you have a basil plant? [Indistinct people conversation] [Device beeping] Dad! They killed her. They meant to shoot me but killed her instead. They used your bike. They transferred 2 crores to your bank account from Dubai. Whoever did it was anonymous. Youâ€™ve are their target Gopi. But why me, dad? I joined Trinetra very recently. Why would they frame me to kill Aacharya and Damodar? Why would they even kill me if their intention is to frame me? Thatâ€™s how they operate. First, they kill the both them, and put the blame on you. Then Trinetra will hunt for you. Then, if they kill you, Trinetra will be chasing a ghost forever. They knew about Acharyaâ€™s route map earlier. This means somebody from Trinetra helped them or Someone from Trinetra actually did it. [Vehicle arrives] You got the clearance from the ministry of Home affairs? Tell them that the CBI has taken over. Maâ€™am! We are telling them that we are from the CBI. -Warn the cops to not contaminate the scene. - Yes, maâ€™am. Maâ€™am! Damodar Sir got a call from a number before the attack. Arjun too got a call from the same number. The number is encrypted. We are unable to trace it. Here are Arjunâ€™s phone and gun. -Keep them in my office. -Yes, maâ€™am. Shyam is on the line, maâ€™am. Maâ€™am! They spotted Arjun in Rajahmundry. The news is in on TV. He was found in a political rally at Rajahmundry Send someone immediately. I am already on my way, maâ€™am. Head to the airport.

[Gun fire] Our mission has been growing with Godâ€™s grace. We train new recruits like you and present them in India. India will be doomed today. Tomorrow. 3 countries will be united as one. -Who is greatest? -Allah [VCR squealing] India has parted our country Pakistan and Bangladesh came into existence.

I like to play. Salma! What do you like? Gun. India is a country of nonbelievers. We should be safe from them. This is a mission thatâ€™s stays for life. and this is our expert trainer. Our very own Indian. Dad. [Music] Tell me, Gopi. Gopi! What happened? Why did you lie about Dad? -Gopi? -Dad! Whatâ€™s the truth? Listen, Gopi. Whatâ€™s the truth? Your dad and I were friends. We met in the army. Madras regiment Fourth Battalion. Great bonding. Wonderful friends. Our friendship has grown into a bond. Trinetra was just established. Raghuveer was recruited to the Assam division. After that. I was assigned to Dehradun along with my colleague. You didn't have mother when you were a kid. Being a motherless child, you were kept at the Delhi house. Your Dad would visit you every month. Dad! Love you, dear. That was the last time you saw him. One day we got a message from Sikkim office. We got to know that classified information was being leaked since one year. To investigate it. with my colleague Vijay. Along with my colleague Vijay. We went to Sikkim. Two of them. [Jeep arriving] Raghuveer. No. He leaked the information. Satya! He has the documents. Heâ€™ll give them. Let me see. He is giving them. He is giving them. [Gun fire] No! [Gun fire] Fire! Keep firing. Abdul! Cover on the right. You take the left. Keep firing John. Documents [Gun goes empty] [Gun fire] -Satya! Are you OK? -Go get the documents. Get the documents. Vijay, check them. Check them. [Gun shot] Vijay! [Blank gun cocking] Why did you do this? You did all this for money? Thatâ€™s not my name. This is not my country. [Gun shot] Vijay. Vijay. [Gun shot] [Splash] Al Mujaheedin killed Raghuveer His body washed away in the river. I didn't just kill your dad. I killed a terrorist. 'Al Mujahideen.' That is your father's identity. He grew up with them, he killed people for them. I got scared that those terrorists will come for you. That is why I changed your identity. Gopi cannot be a terroristâ€™s son. No one knows. Raghuveer wasnâ€™t a soldier who turned out to be a terrorist. He was a terrorist in the guise of a soldier. That is why I killed him. I killed him. How will you take so much pain. Heâ€™s alive. Heâ€™s alive. [Blast] Dad. Dad. What happened? Dad. Dad! Dad. [Gun fire] Raju. [Music] [Tyre screeching] [Music] [Car leaving] [Music] Whereâ€™s Dad? Iâ€™m right in front of you. Whereâ€™s Dad? Iâ€™m right here! [Music] We shall start in a while. Weâ€™ll go to Mumbai by road. and to Karachi by boat. We canâ€™t go to Bangladesh now. You blew that place. Good! You are my son. Is that why you wanted to kill me? Kill you? I spent 20 years without you. [Roaring] Do you know how I found you? Your application. You wrote that youâ€™re my son. That is when I was sure you are my son. Yes! My people are in Trinetra. I knew you wouldnâ€™t come for me. I knew that you wouldnâ€™t agree. Youâ€™ve been nurtured that way for 20 years. You serve your country in the army, Tricolour or Trinetra. If I came for you Satya and Trinetra would kill me. They called me a terrorist. You are my son. That is why I couldnâ€™t stay away. I started this plan when you joined Trinetra. One shot. I made them believe that you killed Damodhar and Aacharya. I set you up. They would definitely kill you. You wonâ€™t have friends, food, shelter or any other way to live. That was the way to bring you to me. You would have no choice. To accept me. You may argue but you will join me later. You will be with me. This country has forced me to do so much to get my son back. This is the country of nonbelievers. My biggest weapon was. Sameera. Sheâ€™s one of our best soldiers. I asked her to get close to you, influence you and find about you and Satya. She tried hard. But, youâ€™re not that easy. We surprised Sameera also. We asked her to give you this injection. Now? We doubted her. I understood then. That Satya didnâ€™t come because of her. You donâ€™t want to come tomorrow, right? We will come when there is a possibility. If she followed our instructions. Satya wouldâ€™ve been dead like Damodhar, Aacharya. You would have been unconscious and brought to me. I suspected her. But, she spoiled the plan. She didn't have the injection when she came to meet you. Sameera didnâ€™t know that I was watching her. I was ahead of her. So, I implemented plan B. [Dialing] [Gun shot] I planned to get close to you through her. But, she got close to you and kept me away from you. You were hunting for who was behind this. and I was waiting to get close to you. Weâ€™ve been looking for each other. What else? [Gasping] Dad! Any last words? Did we meet in the same way again? You might be his father. But, he is my son. Raghuveer! You might be his biological father but I am his real father. Rana! My name is Rana. Rana! You heard right. I am not that easy to trick. This is my plan B! Trinetra is always watching. Go. [Gun fire] Move. Move. Go. Ravi! Gun. [Gun fire] Go and get Gopi. -Get Gopi. Go. -Yes sir. -Rasheed! -Sir. -Start the vehicle. -Okay chief. [Gun fire] Move. Run. [Gun shot] [Fighting sounds] Move. [Fighting sounds] [Gun fire] [Gun fire] [Blast] [Gun fire] [Magazine reload] [Gun fire] [Car leaving] [Car vrooming] Hey! Donâ€™t move. [Collision] [Wind breezing] [Gasps] [Wind breezing] [Door opens] [Gasps] [Gasping] [Bang] Leave it. I will. Will you come with me? Surrender Rana! That sounds like Dad to me. We donâ€™t have any differences. Both of us hold a gun. You are a spy for Trinetra and I work for Al-Mujahidin. We do the same thing. Why do you judge me? Why should I surrender? Youâ€™re betraying my country. -I work for my country. -So, what? -Will you kill your own father? -Wonâ€™t you believe it unless I do? Youâ€™ve been away for 20 years. How can you expect me to let you go? You wonâ€™t come for me. But, you will come for him. He wonâ€™t. Heâ€™s ready to sacrifice his life for his country. My life is nothing. Gopi! Letâ€™s go. [Thunders] Come. How can you expect me to come after what I have seen? Youâ€™re my blood! [Music] I lived with your memories. Donâ€™t believe him. -Heâ€™s trying to emotionally blackmail you. -Hey! Dad. Will you believe him or me? He tried to kill me 20 years ago. He told you that Iâ€™m dead. He convinced me that you are dead. Heâ€™s trying to separate both of us now. Heâ€™s the one who emotionally blackmails you. No, Gopi. We donâ€™t need this. We don't need countries, flags. we don't need any of this. Come with me. Letâ€™s go. Come. Come! [Music] What will you do to become like dad? What do you want? My father is my strength. Do you want him or your father? You can only save your country if you are strong. Gopi! Do you want your dad or these people? I want my country. [Gun shot] [Thunders] [Coughs] Gopi. [Weeping] [Music] [Rainfall] [Music] [Helicopter whizzing] Arjun! Iâ€™m really happy that your here. Iâ€™m just curious to know How did Trinetra find you? Nadiya believed that Iâ€™m innocent. I received my passport and glasses at Vizag. She helped me without Trinetra knowing. We need to help Gopi. Yes, maâ€™am. [Gun shot] Go. Mohammed told that I called before attack to Nadia before he died. Damodhar and I got calls from the same number. Nadia thought that it was from Satya. Hello, Satya. Their person is in Trinetra. That person revealed my application details to Rana. Whoâ€™s that, Shyam? Will you give it like that? Give it to me. I will wrap it up. You gave that bottle to Damodhar that day. You went in search of Satya to the post office at Rajahmundry. That means youâ€™re the one who told Rana about Satya. You set up the background check for Sameera. What? Are you? Sameera faked the background. Sheâ€™s the one who did this. I just canâ€™t believe that you have fallen for this shit! Shyam! I saw the video in Bangladesh. Shyam! What do you like? Computer. It was Rana back then. It is you now. Now? Yes. [Beeps] [Gun shot] Thereâ€™s no difference. Shyam! Theyâ€™re watching you. [Device squealing] [Gun shot] [Slow music] I found this letter from Sameera in your bank locker. Dear Gopi, Iâ€™m not who you think I am. I got scared to reveal the truth. But, I understand that our love is more precious than my life. I thought about it. I remembered what you did. So, this is my letter. I love you. Sameera Shaik. The prime minister will give you an official apology. Will they apologize for calling me a terrorist? Something like it. Youâ€™ve got a new mission. Do you remember Aacharyaâ€™s words? This is a new world that canâ€™t be seen. It's a dark world conquering the world of light. You will have to face challenges, betrayal and loneliness. You will win and you will lose. You should always be ready to sacrifice your life for your country. Such soldiers should not only be at our borders but within our country. They should cross every boundary.
