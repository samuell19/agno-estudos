Easy now, easy. You're awfully excited. We'll have to around one more time. That's more like it. Easy, easy. That's wonderful. That was wonderful. That's good. That was really a nice trip we had this year. There was so many more people to see. There's really something to get around like that, and the way you fellas brought me back home all safe and sound. Now all we have to do is look forward to next year. That was a good trip. Very good trip. Now we get you unhooked and we get you out into the hot spring meadow there, you can get a good feed and get a good, well earned rest. THey're like, "I didn't want a blue one!" I can't give them what they want anymore. I'm not perfect like everybody else, I need, I need... They're just so greedy and they don't understand. Oh, there you are. Hi, Santa. What's the problem? Nothing. Oh, come on now, you can tell me. You can tell me. See Santa, it's like this. All the kids now. They all seem to think that they can have everything they want and they want different different types of toys. Than we give them, and they're so greedy Santa. Well, you can't let that bother you. They're not getting the real idea of Christmas. It should be about love and sharing, and people. It shouldn't be about Things that they want and need. I just feel so bad Santa, I can't do this anymore. We do we do the best we can. I can't help them! We do the best we can. They should be happy. Why can't it just be red, not blue? Why can't they be happy with dinosaurs anymore? I hate, don't like cars. I feel kind of lost. I'm lost and trying to make everything better. They're just not happy with what I give them. Well, you do the best we can, so that's all that can be done. That's all anybody can do. You shouldn't be too sad about that. Remember how Christmas used to be Santa? Kids come down in the morning, they wouldn't even look at their presents for a while, and even when they got them and they didn't get what they wanted, they'd be happy enough just to sit down and play with it for hours and hours. They didn't sit there and say Santa, Santa didn't give me what I wanted. I want things to be the way they used to be. Children to be happy. Not, "I want." Not, "I need." Santa's got a problem and it's not a lack of snow, he'd through snowless skies before as round the world, he'd go. No this time Santa's problem is a pesky little elf whose heart's no longer in her work. And he's talking to himself. It seems she's just not happy with the way this world has gone. It's for the good old days of yore her little heart does long. So Santa is busy thinking of some way to cheer her up. A teddy bear, a kitty cat, or frisky little pup. Oh Lilybell, you tiny elf, whose heart seems broke in two Santa's trying awful hard to make your dreams come true. Even for the wild ones, life is changing. Today people have more concerns and live a much faster life. Now more than ever, we need to reflect on the lives of the wild ones. To gave us more relief from our day-to-day tensions as well as help us find new ways to meet their needs. In this way we will find ways to make our lives better. For we must all share this world together. So you see, we are not meant to be alone. Maybe that's all you need. Come with me and see that little reindeer that's just born over in Crystal Valley. How little she must be Santa, I just can't wait to see her. Oh, she is little, and she's just- wait till you see her, but wait. Don't get too close to that waterfall, it's very dangerous. Thank you. We'll have to go down to my hidden valley. I've heard about that, everyone calls it Crystal Valley. That's because these big crystals hang down to the entrance of the cave. And beyond that, Ii a nice green valley with hot springs. They keep it green nearly the whole year round. Is it true that the frozen waterfall is a result of the hot springs? The heat of the hot springs valley? Yes, that's true. The springs they've got to go somewhere so they go over the waterfalls and they freeze in the process. Before we get our frozen waterfalls. Oh how did you make this beautiful place? I didn't make this place somebody greater than I made it. I just found it and I use it for my reindeer. It's very wonderful. This is a perfect place for a new reindeer to be born. Is it a boy or a girl? It's a girl. What are we gonna name this little deer? Like a story from long ago, name this little one Christy. Santa Claus gazed down in awe at the tiny newborn babe. And asked the helper by his side "can you name this little babe?" Lilybell the elf replied, her big blue eyes all misty. It's like a tale from long ago, let's name this new one Christy. Sa Santa looked in Lily's eyes A thought popped in his head. Of Lilybell and Christy, in a shiny little sled. The sled was Lilys project to help her make it through a slump Christy would be just the one to make it take off with a jump. Santa I have a great idea. Let's have a Christmas for the wild ones. That's a good idea. But it could never really work. But you always tell us, never say never. Just tell me why you think it can't work and I'll give you a reason to make it so. Let's face it, I don't have time to do more than I'm already going on Christmas Eve. With the population growing the way it is, I can hardly make my rounds before it gets light the way it is. Then just make the rounds during the day. That could work. And it would help with another problem. Landing in the woods. But at night with no rooftops, it would be too dangerous for the reindeer to go again. Besides, most places are too small to land that big sleigh in the woods. It just won't work. There's too many problems. It wasn't always too big. The sleigh, I mean. Remember the one you started out with? The one in the shed? It was a lot smaller because you didn't have to carry the big loads that you have today. It's so much smaller it could land almost anywhere, and you know the animals will come and meet you in the clearing. But who would pull the sleigh? My team would be all wore out. Besides, they are just too big to land in such small areas. I would need a strong reindeer, but small enough too. I just don't have a reindeer like that. Such a reindeer would have to be very special. Besides being strong and small, it would have to also fly. And you know how hard it is to teach a reindeer to fly. The reinder must be really determined, and then only a few can succeed. You need Crystal. I'll bet you could teach her this summer. How to fly. I've never had a female reindeer pulling any of my sleighs. You said it. Times have changed. Females can do anything. They can be anything they want to be as long as they are determined and work hard. I bet if you asked her she'd love to pull your sleigh and be the first female reindeer. She'd pull your sleigh. What about a different job to keep her occupied? Why not fix the little sled no longer fit to ride? The one he used so long ago when Christmas first began, when Santa started out to bring good tidings unto man. Back in time, when man and animals seem to have more space, where want and death was not so bold, life was not a madman's race. Perhaps if this old world could see the road leads straight downhill, we take a second look at life and be friends of Lilybell. Oh Lilybell, you tiny elf, whose heart seems broke in two Old Santas trying awful hard to make your dreams come true. Santa's really trying hard to make your dreams come true. See, she loves the idea, she won't let you down. I'll take Christy out- if she's ready, that is. Besides her other training, she's gonna have to learn how to fly. I really enjoyed getting out in wild with these wild ones. Every time I see a new baby born, that means that life is going on. And there's nothing more interesting than to see these little ones grow up. The peace and quiet, solitude, and being alone out here with the wild ones it gives you a restful feeling. It gives you a refreshment so that you can go back and and really get back into the life again. Christmas was never meant to be just for children. It was for all of the animals of the world, and you can help make it so. Christy, you got a big job ahead of you. We're going to make this a big animal Christmas. For one thing, you're going to have to learn how to fly. You're the only one that's small enough to pull my sleigh and land where I've got to in order to reach the animals. It's going to be a big task. But I'm counting on you. It's gotta be around here somewhere. It's gotta be. Look, there it is. This is it. It's gotta be. Look, this is it. But it's a mess. We can do it though. Yeah. This will be perfect. Can it be a good sleigh? Well, not yet, but it will be. Oh, I know. Before this day is over, you're going to think that I'm the meanest old man that ever was. You know, we've got a big job ahead of us. You're gonna help me make all of your little friends at the forest real happy. You're going to have to learn to fly and, we're going to visit all your little friends of the forest, so now you just behave now. Take it easy, oh. Oh, take it easy here. Take it easy. Come on, you'll learn how this is done. That's it. Come on now. Well, I gotta get into this now and get this harness ready so that I'll have it done by the time that Christy is ready. You know? If I've done my work the way some of these guys do, that make these tools. Christmas? I'd never be ready for Christmas. It's really a big mess, isn't it? It shouldn't take too much more work, though I think. It's pretty good. I think so too. And won't it be perfect for Christy. Oh yeah. Hi, girls. Oh hi, Santa. How we doing? Pretty good. Good great. Almost done. Think it'll be good as new. Think it'll be good as new? Well, oh what's this? It's just a minor repair. It's gonna be done in time. Repair really fast. OK, OK if we don't get that on, that's alright too. We promise it'll be perfect. We don't want to disappoint you. OK yeah everything alright on this side too? OK. There. Won't the animals be surprised, Santa? They will, they will. We won't let you down. It'll be ready just in time. I'm sure you won't, well goodnight. Goodnight, Santa. Bye bye! Christy I hardly seen you hiding there in that tall grass. Come on over here and let's try on your new holder. Now hold still. So I can get this on. There. See it fits you now. 'cause I made it so we can let it out as you grow. Now I gotta go and finish the rest of the harness. Christie looks so little for such a mighty task, but neither size nor gender had effect on what was at. So it was another name became a part of Yuletide history. Along with Rudolph and the rest, we add a female deer named Christy. The days ahead, old Santa knew would go so quickly by. Along with all his other work, he'd teach Christy how to fly. Well with Christy and a little sled in a wooded meadow he could land and then a dream so long he'd had, an animal Christmas, would be at hand. OK Christy, here's your new harness. You gotta hold still a little bit. We had to make this adjustment. OK now girl. Let's go for a walk and see how this new harness feels on ya. It's going to feel funny carrying it for a little while, but you get used to it. After awhile it'll be just like anything else, it'll be all in a day's work. And you'll really get to enjoy it. You know you're doing real good Christy. That harness fits for real good. As soon as you get used to carrying that around like that. We'll hook you to the sleigh then. And we're going to have a real nice Christmas, for these little animals of the woods. C'mon, Chrissy. You gotta keep up. Gotta jog a little bit. We gotta get you in shape, you know? Now wait a minute Christy. I gotta check your feet. Well, they're just fine, just fine. OK Christy. We'll put a little weight on now. Just a minute til I get this fastened down. Now we'll try. OK, c'mon Christy. So a little heavier, I know. It's a little heavier, but that's alright. You're doing fine, you're just doing wonderful. That's great. Now we've got to teach you how to fly. But the first thing you gotta do is learn how to jump. Come on. Come on, that's it. That's a good one. Come on. Come on, come on, that's it, that's it. Have you seen the elves? They said they were going to bring Christy up here to get her used to the snow. Oh, there they are now. Isn't Christy wonderful? Ooh! Ooh! Oh look! It's that Jack Frost again. What's he up to? Can't be anything good. She's learned everything that I've tried to teach her. She's really done wonderful. You really- Hi Santa Claus. Jack Frost! Is that you? It's me. Early this year, aren't you? Oh no, I'm right on time this is usual. Hey, You mean it's that close to Christmas already? Yep! Oh my God. It is getting real frosty. It is getting real frosty when you start showing up. I hope you got your little reindeer. She's ready, she's ready, she's really ready, and willing to go. She's looking forward to it. Good. If you look right over here, you will see Christy's mother. She's real proud of all the hard work that this little girl has done. She's been doing real fine. Fact, I think she's getting kind of proud of herself. She's getting kind of anxious to show the world what she can really do. Gee, after all that hard work, I'm really getting thirsty. Here's a glass of water for all the work you've done. Gee, Jack, you never cease to amaze me. After the animals, we could. What are their names? Well. So we make sure. There's Shirley, and Thomas the rabbit. There's Ginger Snap. And Juju. My favorite. They're so pretty. Gotta run colors all over it, nice and brown. The animals are like this kind. OK, so. Sometimes I go like this, see? The animals will eat the corn, and- I should have gathered some things to wipe our hands on. That'd be nice, wouldn't it? I'm just putting these out. I know. So much peanut butter. Oh there. If I put it in this thing, it's easy. Now we just need another bucket. You just have to take 'em down the woodstand and hang them up. This'll be perfect for the animal's Christmas. You can give Mr Santa Claus that job, yes. Ooh! Heh heh! Hoo hoo hoo! Ha ha ha ha ha! What's up, porcupine? Hmm. Um-hmm. Huh. Hmm. Hmm. Oh. Hmm hmm hmm! Woo! Ha ha! Woo hoo! Wahooooo! Oh, it's Tanglefoot. Oh no, not him. We don't need any help! How did he get in here? Watch out. We don't need anymore boards. Tanglefoot! Oh no! Oh, Tanglefoot! Look at this mess. Oh, Tanglefoot. Tanglefoot! Look at this mess you've made. Do you mind helping us out? Oh no, no no. We don't need help with that. Tanglefoot, no! Tanglefoot, please just go. You've already done enough. Look at this mess. Ooh, Tanglefoot. Tanglefoot, just go. Tanglefoot just please, will you go? We don't need your help. Thank you very much, you're not wanted here. Now go away. No no no, Tanglefoot. We can do it ourselves. You're no help at all. Why don't you just leave? Just go Tanglefoot. Go on, we don't need you. Oh Tanglefoot, has got himself into a mess again. If anything had once gone right I can't remember when. With a heart as big as all get out, he tries so hard to please. Is it a curse, or something worse? That his hard luck won't sleep. Can't recall his given name, because of his hard luck. And every time he'd call for help they'd try to pass the buck. No one stopped to think their actions cut him to the bone More and more old Tanglefoot just ended up alone. Tanglefoot don't give up yet. Your race is not been run. Remember behind every cloud is a bright and shining sun. Although the world might laugh at you, and some of them might scold. They'll learn old Tanglefoot has a heart of solid gold. Hey lady. Hey, lady. I know you're worried about Christy. She's doin' alright. She's ready to go. I'm going to take her up to the compound and we're going to get all hooked up. She's ready, she's ready to go. Oh wow, I can't believe it. Hi girls. Hi, Santa. How we doing? Great, we're almost done. That's good we got a lot of time, so let's have some cookies. Oh thank you, Santa! Don't take the sleigh down by the waterfall. There is, there are frozen waterfalls. It's too dangerous. OK, we won't. I'll be gone for a little while, but I'll be in touch. OK! Bye, Santa. Thank you! Grandma talked of old Jack Frost and all the things he did. Acrostic scenes on windowpanes colored leaves in which we hid. She said when leaves begin to turn, then winter is close by. Seems everyone blamed old Jack Frost and I always wondered why. For late one night I saw Jack Frost and he didn't seem so old. As he dusted all the maple leaves turn the greens to red and gold. And as he did, I saw a smile appear upon his face. And I knew this was no ogre, but a spirit filled with grace. So Jack Frost, do your magic tricks and let the nations wonder. How one who's said to be so bad can fill the world with splendor. Well, Tanglefoot. Thought you were with all the elves. You thought you'd be no help to them? This can be a real pickle. You can't listen to people like, some people even say I'm no good. And cannot be helpful. It's true. You can't listen to them they'll all need you. You must go back. You got skills the elves lack. You got the part they need to finish their sleigh. Yes, you can help, Tanglefoot. You're the one they need. Go! Help the elves! So Jack Frost, do your magic tricks and let the nations. wonder, how one who's said to be so bad can fill the world with splendor. Look, it's sticking. It must be slower than normal. You're just not a good- Just kind of put it in the edge here. So it'll hang out. Hard to do sometimes. Getting the hang of it now. Oh that's good, yeah. Here we go. Okay then. You got it right. Hang it up. Here. Ha ha, okay. Now I can put it on this side. How's it look? Pretty good? Hello, Lilybell? This is Santa, I don't have much time but I really need your help. I'm all tied up, but I'm trying to get away. It's taking more time to get these things together than I thought. So I need your help. It's very important that you finish the sleigh by the time I get home. I want to hook up Christy as soon as I get there. The time is running out and Christy should have one more practice pulling the sleigh before it's loaded. You could save me a lot of time if you move the sleigh down to the practice area. But don't try to move it past the frozen waterfalls. It might get away from you and crash down into the ice and rocks below the falls. It's best to be safe. And you take care of things, now. Remember now I'm relying on you and, tell Mrs. Claus not to worry. I'll be home later today. It's going to be a very special Christmas. You could save me a lot of time if you'd move the sleigh down to the practice area. Try to move it past the frozen waterfalls. Remember now I'm relying on you. It's going to be a very special Christmas. Relying on you to save me a lot of time. Remember now I'm relying on you. Ha ha ha! Tanglefoot, stop! No, no, Tanglefoot! No, no, no! Our sleigh! No, the sleigh! The sleigh! Tanglefoot, give us back- Oh no! The sled! It's all your fault! It's ruined! How will we ever bring Christmas to the animals? They're going to be so disappointed in us. Tanglefoot! It was Tanglefoot! It's all your fault! Hmm. Ooh! Oh oh. Ha ha ha! Let's go. Tanglefoot! The sleigh! Just a minute! Whoah! You got me confused. It's just like this. Tanglefoot threw the sleigh right off a cliff, and now it's buried under- Jack Frost helped him, it wasn't our fault! it was all Tanglefoot and Jack! Jack Frost, too? I can't believe... Jack Frost ... buried! What's going on here, anyway? Tanglefoot. I knew I'd find you here. You probably think the sleigh is ruined, 705 00:49:32,634 --> 00:49:38,954 and it's all your fault. Did you not see the Avalanche, Tanglefoot? Yeah, it was a big avalanche. A big avalanche, full of Frost snow. The sleigh is just waiting at the bottom of the hill in the soft snow, for somebody to pull it out. Yes. Pull out the sleigh. The sleigh can be pulled out and dragged home. Yes! You are the only one strong enough to pull out the sleigh. You can save Christmas for them. If you don't, no one will. You can save the day Tanglefoot. You can make Christmas for all the animals just how it should have been. Yes. Go, Tanglefoot! One at a time. One at a time. Well Santa, it was Jack Frost, it wasn't us, and- Santa, we just don't know what to do. So Santa, you see what our problem is. It's Tanglefoot! Not us, we tried everything- What do we do? Oh my gosh, Santa! Look! I see! Oh my God, it's Tanglefoot! You brought back the sleigh! Tanglefoot! You saved the day! This is pretty good. Ha ha ha. [Santa mumbles] Whoah! OK, I guess we better get the sleigh loaded so that I can get out of here. Help me. Oh no! Are you okay? Tanglefoot! You came to help us! Here, Tanglefoot. Good job. Tanglefoot. Here's another one. Thank you. No, I gotta sit there. I gotta sit there. No, Tanglefoot! Help us. It's gonna fall off. We gotta tie this on here pretty secure. Yeah. Don't want to lose those presents. Somebody's gonna have to take that off, you know? We're all ready, Christy. Amazing. Ok, I'm off to see our little friends. I've been waiting a long time for this opportunity. Thank you. Bye bye, now. Bye bye. Don't forget. Now what are they up to? Can never tell what those guys got on their mind. Here I thought I was ready to go and they take off like as if something is really wrong. But I'd better wait and see what's up. Now you see, you're getting anxious too, Christy? Oh, it's a long ways up there isn't it? It's going to be a new experience for you too. We'll just have to wait and see what's going on. Well. I wish they'd hurry up because we got a lot of traveling to do tonight. Oh well, thank you, my little friend. Here you go, Santa! Our little friends. I'll really enjoy this. Thank you, thank you. Goodbye! Bye bye. Bye, Christy. I'll have to show 'em that you girls thought of them while we were getting ready. Bye bye. Love you. Bye, Christy. Easy now, easy. You're awfully excited. Bye Santa! Have fun on the trip! Merry Christmas to all the animals! Bye, Christy. Make sure you feed her a lot of treats, Santa. I almost stepped on Tanglefoot. You can have a lot of little treats. Good luck! Be good! I'll only find trees standing in a shady forest nook, a beacon for its dwellers like in a fable book. As dawn today, a man dressed in a shiny suit of red. He has a sack upon his back, he's taken from his sled. He thinks it must be Santa, but what is this I see? He's hanging apples, oranges, nuts, and figs upon this tree. For this is not your ordinary children's Christmas eve, All God's creatures, sharing love, the tidbits that he leaves. Santa's hanging fruit loops, on a woodland Christmas tree, garlands made of fruit loops for his forest family. On Christmas eve the children of the world his sleigh might see, But today his sleigh is loaded for his forest family. The morning sun sews sparks of love upon the little tree, as big and small, the creatures all the gifts have come to see. A smile appears upon the face of the man who's dressed in red. He whispers low, "goodwill to all," as he flies off in his sled. Santa's hanging fruit loops, on a woodland Christmas tree. Garlands made of fruit loops, for his forest family. On Christmas eve, the children of the world his sleigh might see, But today his sleigh is loaded for his forest family. Today his sleigh is loaded for his forest family. Oh, we made it down alright. Yeah, I get my feet on the ground now. That was kind of a rough landing girl, but you'll learn. Well, we'll see who lives here. Yeah, it kinda shook up the old back a little bit. But get myself over here a little more comfortable. Oh, I see. I think it's our friend Fox that lives here. Well. We'll decorate here a little bit for him. He'll probably show up in a little bit to see what's going on. Yeah, there he is. There he is. You gotta be as curious as he can be. See what's going on. Well. This is gonna fix him up for a little bit, anyway. He still isn't sure what we're up to. But that's alright. He'll appreciate it when he gets down anyway. He ain't looking happy right now does he? Oh, here is my friend Whitedale. We gotta have a little treat for him too. He's come around here to see what what all we're doing. And he's just so friendly that it's, it's really nice. There's a nice marshmallow for you. Now I know that he loves these treats like this. We'll have to see what else I got now. Let's see what other friends we can find here in the forest. So we move on over here now and. See if our friend Bob is home. We'll wait a little while. If he's home, yeah, there he is. He shows up. He seems to know right when I'm coming. Either that or he's been sitting over there, watching me with the the other little friends of the forest here. Oh he looks like he isn't too happy to see me here right now. We'll have a little chat. I think he'll warm up a little bit. This was one guy that day he don't trust too many, too many intruders into his part of the woods. Get down here on his level and it won't look quite so big to him. He's got a mean look in his eye yet. Now he's coming around, he, I think he recognizes me now, he knows who it is. He knows that he's not in any trouble. Yeah, sure, he's ready to talk now. But he's still keeping his back protected. You notice that? Now we'll see who else is in the forest here this morning, oh. Oh oh, he wants to play. He's very happy to see here this morning. Yeah, he's gonna start to find out what's in that bag all on his own. Now, who else is here? Oh yeah. Oh Buck. He's been a friend of mine for many, many years, so. We just sit down here and have a little talk with him and he'll come around out. There he comes. That boy's always looking for a little handout. But he's really a nice boy to have around. One thing about him, he's always ready to eat no matter what you have to hand him. Boy. He's right there. He's right there. He's always got his nose right there. He's ready to eat. Oh oh. He spills them, but that's alright. Here's my friend Otto the otter. He's coming outdoors around now. I guess he wants to see what's going on too. Little cautious this morning. Uh oh. He's gonna be very careful who sees him. Come on out. Come on out. That's it. That it, old boy. Would you like to have a little treat too? He's not gonna be too friendly here for a little while. Uh-on, there's Stinky. Now this is one boy that you don't want to mess around with. He's alright as long as you give him plenty of room. But don't try to to crowd him because he gets a little excited and then things get to be a mess. I don't think Mrs. Claus would want me in the house after I fooled with this guy. Well, looks like he's gonna. Come over and nose around a little bit and see what's going on anyway. Now who have we found? This is a guy I guess they call him Porky. Their friend porcupine. He's another fellow that you don't want to get excited. He's like grandma's pincushion. He's full of needles. If he starts sticking needles around, he gets pretty uncomfortable. But as long as you don't push him. He's a friendly little guy too. He's also a nosy little guy. He's one guy that you don't want to try to mess with there, 'cause he if he gets a little irritated, why he can throw a lot of needles at you. And he knows me so I don't have to worry about that. Oh looks like Christy's getting a little uneasy about that guy being under the sleigh. That's alright girl. Just stand still and he'll go away and, not give us any trouble at all. He's gonna do a little job of trimming trees now. Yeah, there he goes. That's one branch. Maybe that one was in his way, he couldn't climb very good. He's gonna fool around here and find another one that he don't like the looks of. He'll drop that one down to the ground too. There it goes. Well, let's see, here is our friend the Fisher. He's a kind of a curious little animal too. He's always looking for something to get into. But he's pretty cautious about where he goes. We just give him a little bit of time. Just give him a little bit more time. He'll get see a warm up here in a little bit. I don't know what he thinks he's doing, but. Oh I- I guess he's over there now, and now he's getting curious about what's down in the log. He don't know what he's looking for, but he's digging. Wish he'd come over just a little bit closer here. But he's another one them boys that's kinda cautious. Now we'll see who we can find here. Here's our friend Fox. He's supposed- Supposed to have his buddy around here someplace. Well, there she is. There she is. She's a little bit cautious about coming out to where you can see her. She's gonna stay back, stay hid. She'll let him go up. Do the parading around. Get into trouble, so to speak. If there's any trouble to get into, that's his job. He don't seem to want to be too friendly either this morning too get too close. He's still staying out in the limelight so that he just kind of protects her 'cause she's she's a little bit on the on the cautious side. Uh-oh, there's our friend, Buck back again. That's alright, Christy. He's just back for another handout. That boy can eat. He's always looking for a handout. You're always looking for- uh-oh. There's a little bit left in here. Yeah, OK. Well, we're off now to see what we can find out. See some of the other friends in the forest. This has really been a wonderful day. Really been a wonderful day. Now here's our friend Goose. He's kinda out of place right here. He figures that he should've went South cold as it looked, but even at that he makes himself right at home with us. Now I think we should go up there up the hill here. I think that his friend is up on top there. Oh yeah, yeah. We gotta say a Merry Christmas to him, too. He a little, he's not so sure that he wants to see me around here. Oh, he's gonna warm up. He's gonna have him a marshmallow. These guys are all pretty cautious about who comes to see him out here in the forest. That old Coyote has been playing tricks on me long enough. I gotta go over and see if I can get even with him. Play a little trick on him for Christmas for a change. There. Now stay here, dear, for a while. He's gonna show up. Hey Coyote. There he goes. Hey Coyote. He's acting like he's not paying attention to me, but he's trying to figure out where I'm at. There he found me. He's really a friend of mine, even if he is always trying to play tricks on me. I got the best of him this time, he didn't know where I was at for awhile. He's really a nice guy though. Yeah. He loves to be petted. He also loves to play tricks on people too. Basically on me. He's acting like he's real sorry about what he's done now, but he's up to something. Well, I knew it. I knew it. I knew it. He got my bag now he. He figures that he can keep it away from me. I'll just make him think that I'm going to try to take it away from him. Boy he's right at the height of his glory now. He wants me to chase him, that's what he wants. Hold on a little bit. We'll have a tug of war here in a minute. Yeah, he thinks he's really... Uh-oh. He won that one, he thinks. Now that makes him happy. That makes him real happy when he thinks he's got the best of me again. You see what he's trying to do? He's trying to take my glove again. I'm going to hool him this time, he ain't gonna get it. Well, it's been a wonderful Christmas, Christy. Job well done. Everybody seems to be very happy. Go back home now. Now we'll get you out here to the hot springs faster, Christy for a nice feed in a well-earned rest. In the meantime, Merry Christmas everybody! Merry Christmas! I'll only find trees standing in a shady forest nook A beacon for its dwellers, like in a Fable book. As drawn today, a man dressed in a shiny suit of red. Merry Christmas, everybody! Merry Christmas! He thinks it must be Santa, but what is this I see? He's hanging apple, oranges, buts, and figs upon this tree. For this is not your ordinary children's Christmas eve, All God's creatures share in love this tidbits that he leaves. Santa's hanging fruit loops on a woodland Christmas tree. Garlands made of fruit loops for his forest family. On Christmas Eve, the children of the world his sleigh might see. but today his sleigh is loaded for his forest family. The morning sun so sparks of love upon the little tree, as big and small the creatures, all their gifts come to see. A smile appears upon the face of the man who's dressed in red. He whispers low, "goodwill to all," as he flies off in his sled.
