Please... - Can we shoot it again? - Yeah, I think so. Let's go. Please, let's do it. OK, down, down... that's it. Shake the can! Shake it! OK, thanks. That was good. I think that was good, huh? And what's it for? Why are you filming? It's going to be sent to Europe, for German television. Ah... But to find out how people in Cali live? So we can film all the poverty. Oh right. We have to move in, but carefully, respectfully, understand? Don't scare her, or anyone else. Walk over there... Careful. Pan from one face to another... The face, the children. Let's go. OK, start. Camera... Camera... Don't stop shooting! Let's go over to her. Come on... OK, let's shoot her. She's laughing. Get the clapboard out of there. Cut! Cut! Let's go!

Go ahead. Don't stop! Don't stop! I'm not getting out here. This place looks so controlled, look. OK, cut! This place is so sinister. If we get out here they'll steal our camera. He's getting mad... Lookout! Careful! That's enough. Cut! Did we get it? -Yes Thank god. So what do we need? We need crazy people, beggars, street kids.. What other kinds of poverty are there? Let's see... There's that crazy guy who gave us the slip yesterday. Yeah, the crazy guy that got away. OK, but we've got just about everything. Remember, we still have to go to Bogota We're running out of subjects. We re using all our film on those crazy people and street kids and stuff like that. Shoot from a distance with a zoom because she's really crazy... Let's try to move in though. Let's move in. Come on! Come on! Shoot her! Shoot her! Pan down! Move the camera down... That's it. I think we've got it. Stop there. Change positions, lady! Slow down. Get a little closer to them... Here. Slower... that's right. Don’t stop. Don't stop, keep moving. Get that little group over there. Easy, easy now, don't stop... That's right. Over there. Look, look, look... OK, that's enough. Cut! Let's go! Let's get out of here. Let's go get some whores. Where can we find some whores? Eleventh Street and Tenth Avenue. Then all we'll need is a crazy person. We still need a crazy person. Do you know where we can find a crazy person? I will now burn one of the most delicate parts of the skull: the eyes. Now I'll burn my eyes and will jump thru those dangerous knives? Or work with these tiny and dangerous pieces of glass? The tongue that talks too much must be punished. I am about to punish mine. People say "the flame doesn’t burn" It’s not real... Why? He says he's going to punish the tongue that talks too much but what happens? The tongue continues to talk. First, I mix it all up; I shuffle my dominoes with my bare hands... I will wash my face with these tiny dangerous pieces of glass... I will now slither like a serpent across the desert, desperately thirsty... I will now jump through that dangerous ring of knives, but first let me rest. Ten, twenty cents for my work would be much appreciated. Those of you who help me out understand the meaning of art in Colombia... That's the easiest thing I do. Why? To stick the knife in... I'd appreciate a small contribution... Don't throw anything at me, kids. Thank you very much for your applause. Those of you who give nothing. Those who can give 10, 20 cents. Let’s see A small contribution, Nobody gives me anything... Just look at them. Look at that! It's good stuff. Too bad we re out of film. I think it's alright. Let's go check out the whores. Yeah, the whores Over on 19th. - Did it come out OK? - Perfect. OK, look. Hold on a minute and you can make some money, OK? OK, take off your pants. Come on! That's it. Into the water! Let's see.. Let's see. Let's see... That's it. Into the water! Next! Swim around a little and come get the money. Come for the money Look over here! Share this now, Like good kids, OK? OK, now dive in for the money. Careful or you'll cut yourself on the glass in there. Go get it... I'm not going to make it too easy now.. OK, cut! You cut yourself? I'll give you some money for a band-aid... Let's film him. What's the matter? I'll throw you the coins. What's up? That's it. Swim. OK, that's good. What about you? OK, here's some money for a band-aid. Why are you taking pictures of these kids? They're always coming here... People are always coming here to make money off us... - Here in our country. - Don't be stupid! Argue! It's so stupid! Why should we let them? Always the same poverty, the same misery, That's all they want to show. This is the real thing: reality. All the gringos come here to exploit us. They only print books and pictures but never help us. Let them film. - They'll make money off of this. - They'll get paid for it. They'll get paid to show this. I'm sick of seeing it every day... - They're filming the truth. - What truth? It's just shit. Why do they always film the misery, the poverty? What's the problem? You shouldn't be filming these kids. We have to film it so people realize it exists. We know all about it. There's the film "Paco" and the book by Jose Gutierrez. it's always the same. But we have to show it because it's always there. No, that's just bullshit. You should never do that. But you don't even know what kind of film we're making. Of course I do, it's a documentary to sell to a foreign country. Hello? OK, thanks. Hello? What's up? Everything's fine. Tomorrow? PK. We figured we'd finish here today... Hang on a second. - What’s up, man? - It’s all taken care of. - Hang on. - You're on the phone? - Hello? Yeah. Hello? Yeah, it was Ramiro. Yeah, it looks great. We're going to shoot with a family... a final decisive scene. It's just that we shot a lot of other stuff we can use for other things... No, no, no just the opposite. It's critical but I don’t think it'll be a problem. If it's a problem who cares... in Europe. Fine. Fine. Yeah, I'll tell him. Bye. What? OK, talk to you later. - It was that jerk. - Did you fix it? It's all set. The corollary is much shorter and I changed one word. The first part goes: "The corollary is practically inevitable, cases of family abandonment abound..." Hang on. How does it go? "The corollary is practically inevitable, cases of family abandonment abound. Child vagrancy, juvenile delinquency, dementia, begging..." Hang on a second... Javier and the family are here... the woman we hired to play the poor mother. The young girl? Yeah. Wait a second. Good morning. How are you? Are these the children? I think they'll be fine. You only have to learn a few lines. Just these answers to some questions I'm going to ask. They're really easy. Before we go to the location, let's rehearse them. - This is the director. - How are you? They all look just fine. Do you have the clothes? Yeah... Change into these clothes. Take a look at the clothes I picked out for the man. We have to pick him up on our way to the location. - The one who's playing her husband? - Yes. - Did he learn his lines? - Yes. The clothes look fine to me. Tell me what's up. I wasn't paying attention. One more thing: I had to pay the woman 500 pesos. I think that's enough. I just spoke to the man. No, we changed the word "alcoholism” to “illiteracy”... "cases of family abandonment, child vagrancy, juvenile delinquency, dementia, begging and illiteracy.” We used illiteracy instead of alcoholism, which was the original word, because we had some problems during the shoot... We had a real problem. We were filming those bums when this guy came at us with a stick! Take a look at the clothes. What do you think? I'll tell you what- undress them when we're ready to shoot. I don't think the hole in the shirt will be a problem either. No, it's all fine. Let's call those guys. OK, come on now. No, give me that magazine Let's go! Let's finish this shit. We only have 400 feet of film left. That's enough. OK. can we go now? I'll see you in the taxi. Wait for me. On the left. I don't think it's around here. Keep going. Keep going. It's just that all these neighborhoods look alike... Keep going. It was a house just like that one. Keep going. A bit further. It's a wooden house. Yeah, over here. But this isn't it. It doesn't matter. This one will work. Made to order... - There’s nobody here. - Nobody? So let's go. Get out. Get out the camera, man. We'll shoot sync sound here. Come on! We can shoot it all here. We'll put he family over here and interview them. The family, please! Put the tripod over here. Ready? Did you rehearse? Let's go over it again. The camera over there. Let's start the interview. We need to shoot how they live, OK? Let's go. I think the best thing would be to zoom in on all these textures, all their stuff, what Lewis calls the “culture of poverty”... All this... And then stop here on this pot, and - then go onto to the next one. OK? - Yeah. OK, come on, let's shoot it. Let's go. Ready? Camera... I think the best thing would be to move in from the outside, I think a wide shot would be better. - A wide shot? - Yeah. Right. Let's start with a wide shot, but remember to get the details, the things, the objects... Look, the newspaper, and then finish up with the shoes. I think the guy’s a cobbler. - Got it? - Yeah. - The shoes and everything? - Yeah. Let's go. I'm getting tired. - How did you do with the pot? - I got some good stuff. OK, you're not a carpenter you're a cobbler... So this is the final shot, perfect conclusions and everything, OK? Ready? Hurry up, man, we're losing the light. OK. Ready? - Sound! - Rolling! Camera! Slate! "Whose Future?” final scene, take One Action! Do you live here? For the past nine years. How many people live here? My husband, the two children And two cousins who had to move in from the country. There's six of us. Does your husband work? No, he's out of work now. I'm a cobbler, right? But they stole my tools. They broke in and took everything... Sometimes I do some carpentry work, you know? Have your children been ill? They kids have been sick, they broke out in a rash and had fevers Have they been vaccinated against smallpox? No, sir. - Do you know how to read and write? - No, sir. - And you, ma’am? - No. Do you plan on having more kids? Well, you never know. The corollary is inevitable... cases of family abandonment abound... child vagrancy... juvenile delinquency... dementia, begging... and illiteracy. And on a larger scale a gigantic mass of humanity that doesn't share in the nation's benefits or take part in political and social decisions victim of a group of circumstances of a system it can have no significant impact on these conditions. At times apathy, or the conditions of unavoidable ignorance, at times the dramatic need to earn a living, at times all these factors together prevent men and women, marginal youth, from getting their voices heard... What happened? What's up with that guy? Bloodsucking vampires! You only come here to make people laugh in far away places.. - Cut! - He fucked up the take! Hey, sir! Please step aside, we're making a film. - Who? Me? - Yeah, you! Move! What do you mean move? Where do you think you are? Sir, please do us a favor A favor? Hey, guard! Go see what’s the matter with that guy. Sir, why don't you just move over and let them leave? Why don't you go film somewhere else? Why don't you just step back? This is my backyard, asshole! Good afternoon. I'm the producer of this film. Do you live here? I'm sorry we just let ourselves in, but now we've got a problem with the light... If we don't finish the film quickly, we're in trouble. We have to finish the film here. Why here? Do you know we chose your house from among many others? Over 25% of Colombian houses are just like yours. So if there are so many of them, why did you pick mine? I'm sure we can work this out friendly - How much am I worth? - We’re not buying anyone. How much do you think I'm worth? Let's work this out quickly and you'll make some money out of it. Do you know what you can do with your money? Look here! Look. Look at this. Just wait and see. Take your cameras and go somewhere else and leave me alone! - Just wait and see! - Let’s film this guy. - Come on!. - Keep filming! So you're afraid? You're afraid, aren't you? - Who are you? Charles Bronson? - I’m not doing anything. Bullshit! Open your eyes - you're being filmed, dressed up like a poor man. You phony! - I didn't even get paid! - Go on! Take your money! Here it is! Come and get it! Come! Bunch of know-it-alls... "Do you live here?" "Do you have children?" "Have they been vaccinated against smallpox?" "Can you read and write?” I've heard it all. Look! Look! Look! Cut! Was it OK? What do people here have to say about the film? For example, Here on the street there are several people who have asked how I got to where I am. And I tell them: it's a question of grace and luck. You need two things: That leaves them dumbfounded. That leaves them dumbfounded. I like to confuse them when they're trying to understand. What's your favorite part of the film? My favorite part of the film is... mostly... the satire. Which part? Whereabouts? - The obscene part. - Really? - Yeah. - Why? Because people never imagined That I'd be allowed the luxury of getting naked and would wipe myself with bills. Like I said, I'm the only lucky man in this life to have wiped his ass with bills. Not dirty ones, freshly minted at the bank. Do you think all vampires of poverty deserve the same thing? Well, why not? Because... really, anyone who does this isn't looking beyond the color of the money, and that's not me. I'm after the document. What is this movie trying to say about film? Well, keep an eye out, because you're being filmed. You stand there and that's right where they've got a lens or a powerful camera pointed, or they're stealing your image or somebody's taking your picture without you knowing, right? What would you say to those who make films? Around here they say the cow that shit the best films are Americans, right? And they been shitting for awhile now, but not anymore. There are others who shit higher and better. We Colombians also have a talent for moving around in front of a movie camera. Even if we lack culture. Why not? MY NAME: DIRECTION, EDITING AND SOUND.
