The new casino tycoon Ho Sun... ...came to Macau in the 40's to make his fortune. After trials and tribulations, he at last... ...struck a deal with the government in the 60s, and obtained the licence to run a casino. Although the new casino New Garden was oppressed... ...by Wong Cheung's gang, Ho Sun, his partner King of Ghosts... ...and Kwok Yingnam overcame all obstacles, and their gambling business took off. Ho Sun at last became the... ...casino tycoon. As for his old lover, she took off with his son to some faraway place. In 1970, the Hotel Lisboa opened for business, in the same year the casino was also opened. Sun chaired the Macau Entertainment Company, and Mr. Nip became Managing Director & General Manager. The two fell out due to difference of opinion, and their stand-off worsened. Wow... Master Chan Is the fung shui of Lisboa really so deadly? Yes It is set up in such a way that... ...its exterior resembles a bird cage. Once the gamblers enter, people inside are like caged birds going round & round. They don't know even if they have been skinned alive. What... The entrance is even deadlier. It's known as "bat sucking money". Doesn't it look like a upside-down bat? Not only that. It's a blood-sucking bat. The red neon lights are on 24 hours, they are like a bat's claws. Once you're in, you're caught, and you can't leave till sucked dry off your money. This is a eight-cornered flying hammer. Man or animal within 49 zhang (490 feet)... ...will be hit. They'll go in dazed and make their contributions. The ceiling atop the lobby is adorned with pirate ships. Westerners made their fortune at sea. In fact, they robbed underdeveloped places. Even before you enter the casino, the pirates have robbed you. Scary, right? - Let's not enter this way then. - Yes... This side is even worse. Why? There are two doors here, one is the exit, one is the entrance, & can't be mixed up. So what should we do? That is the door to death. If entering from here, one is bound to lose all. The gamblers rush in, and they are cleaned out by the casino. So... where should we enter? This way. This is the only loophole; the only way you can come out without losing. All the staff therefore will enter & exit from here. We'll look out for the right time... ...and the right opportunity. Start the attack before midnight - and you'll surely win. - Alright... Have you kept safely the 3 charms I gave you? - Keeping them safely... - Yes... Any affairs with women? Haven't even touched one for a week. Stepping on the 7 stars with the seal of wealth. Attack! Wait, the god of wealth is southwards. That's the position. But we are here for making a windfall. God of fortune is at this position. - We'll surely win today. - Yes. - Double sides... - Great! Great... Win again! - Great! - I told you that we will surely win. Fourteen on a consecutive row. - But the time has expired, let's retreat. - Alright. Hey... tea money for you. What is it, Master? Mr. Ho's facial complexion is bad today. Really? Let's go back and gamble again. Let's go again. Hey, those guys have won a lot. Master Nip, who would come if nobody wins. Do you know that the bald guy in sunglasses... ...is the well-known fung shui master of Southeast Asia. Those Thai folks have invited him over... ...to break our fung shui arrangements. Our architect is a foreigner, how would he know anything about fung shui. Who knows if you've someone teaching him discreetly! Master Nip, if one could win by just knowing fung shui, we would have gone bankrupt a long time ago. But they are really winning. I've watched them for two hours. They would surely lose all they've won. The wealth position is located here. I'm now standing right on it. Let me try... No, let me do it. What? You've lost! You've lost our last two dollars. Beat him... Sun, how did you know they'd lose... ...to the last penny? They've bet for six hours, and haven't looked at the watch once. This is rotten ass, and rotten ass is doomed to lose. That's why I've always told others... ...that there's no sure-win in gambling. - Mr. Ho. - Yes? What is it? Someone from the TV station wants to interview you. The PR Department has agreed. What's with those PR people... ...agreeing to interviews so indiscriminately? People might think I like to show off. Is it a man or woman? Well... a lady called Dik Wan, she's quite pretty. Oh... show her in. Alright. Miss Dik, is it? Please stay. Mr. Ho hasn't asked you to go in yet. How arrogant, who does he think he is? I'm sorry, this is a non-smoking area. So many rules, might as well open a school instead of a casino. Is it Miss Dik Wan? - Mr. Ho has asked you in. - Yes. Have a seat please. Record every word I say. Yes. Mr. Ho, I'm representing the TV station here today. We want to do a special series for you. Also... - we'll be holding a... - Hello. ...charity jogging event next month. - We hope you could participate, - Yes. And be the captain of a team. Mr. Ho, I'm sorry. Mr. Nip has some urgent business. Excuse me. What is it? - Hello. - Sun, Ngau B and Chyun Bill, these two loan sharks want to create trouble here. You'd better go back immediately. Why? For that territory in Bat Ye Tin. Ngau B said it was his, and Chyun Bill was not convinced. Can you handle them? What do you want me to do? You are now the Company's chairman. You'd better hurry back and handle it. I've business to deal with, ask her to leave her number. I'm sorry, Miss Dik. Mr. Ho has to rush to Macau for some urgent business. We will arrange for the interview some other time. I just need ten minutes. I'm sorry. Then let me talk to Mr. Ho myself. He's left already. This is so discourteous. Mr. Ho will apologize to you some other time. So arrogant! Alright, I won't give up! I will definitely do the interview today. Mr. Ho. What's the status? Ngau B and Chyun Bill are up there. They want to wait for you to come back to settle it. These loan sharks are getting more and more unruly. They think the triad is supreme. Can a casino exist without triads? It's like the relationship between chicken and egg, where's there's chicken there are eggs & vice versa. Let's go... - Mr. Ho, I've something to discuss with you. - What's the matter? I have no time now, maybe later. It's very urgent. No need to be so rash. Chyun Bill, get yourself a Thai chick. What's all the squabbling about! Mind your own business! I can do as I please, it's none of your concern. Damn you! Alright, you've agreed that you won't fight... ...before Sun comes back. You must honour your words. Master Nip, in case Ho Sun is not back in a year, does it mean I can't beat this bastard for a year? That's right, Sun is too cunning, who knows what tricks he'll be playing. What tricks will I be playing? What's the matter? So you are finally back. What're you going to do? Don't worry! - Really? - Brother Sun, it's good you are here. Originally, we were the only ones giving usurious loans. But since he came, he's been using mean ways to get my business. We were here first. My men said if we are... ...out of business, we might as well kill that bastard. You'd better think carefully with your damn ass. You think this is on a first come first serve basis. If this is the case, Brother Sun should have asked Mr Fu to be the in charge here. This is a society where power matters most. - So you're asking for a fight! Kill his ass! - Hit him! You are too much! You are here a bit late. I should have dealt with the case myself. I said no problem. Really? I'll polish your shoes if it is really so. Brother Sun, do you think we'll be afraid of you... ...when you take out a gun. You only have one gun which has just 12 bullets in it. We've twenty men here, can you Kill us all? I know. I only need to kill the two leaders. What do you want? Well... I just want you to stop for three minutes. Ngau B, Chyun Bill, I want to talk to you both, come in. Brother Sun, nothing you say will be of any use. This fight is unavoidable; nothing much to talk about. That's right! If we don't fight, We'll lose face. How are we going to survive then! Well said, I agree that you must fight. But you as leaders... ...need to ensure that your men don't get hurt. I have two knifes here. I'll let whoever is left... ...to manage the loans business. No need to ask your men to fight at all. It'd be the same for the two of you to fight. What? You're asking us to fight ourselves? Don't move... Try if you've guts, - I'll kill you bastard! - Try to come close! - Try if you have guts, try... - Come... Attack! I have won... Are you fighting for real, bastard! I'll kill you! Bastard, you're doing this for real too! - Don't come closer... blood... - It hurts... You are always boasting, but when it comes... ...to a real fight, you're cowards. Do you still want to fight? Let me suggest this. I'll kill you both... ...and let someone else handle the business, alright? Brother Sun, it's just minor misunderstanding, we can talk this out. We are friends. We should be able to settle it. We don't want to put you in a difficult position. - Right? - That's right... Here's 200 thousand dollars, 100 thousand each... ...for the boys' medical fees. Brother Sun, you've been so good to us, how can we take your money. I don't agree with you. Brother Sun is well-intended. If I do not accept it, it would mean I am not sincere. Brother Sun, I'll take it to show good faith. Brother Sun, I won't take your money. But in order to let you do some charity, I'd take it and give it to them. That's right, let's be clear about everything. Pretend nothing has happened today. Let's go for a Jacuzzi. Go for mahjong instead. Alright. When are we going for a Jacuzzi? Better go for mahjong first. Whatever you say. Brother, what is it? Hide the weapons. Silly boy! Let's say a vow and become blood brothers now. Let's go... Mr. Nip, Mr. Ho has bought many new shoes. Sun, you've settled the matter. Hope they'll listen to you. Mr. Ho... I'm not in the mood to talk. Let's talk tomorrow. Ko, is Miss Dik Wan's phone number real? Try it. Alright. Damn it! There's no point killing me. Where am I supposed to get 3 million dollars. No money? You dare gamble without money? The interest is too high; few hundred grand become 3 million. What do we live on if no interest. You don't have money but your boss has. Borrow from him. He won't lend money to me. Listen to me well. Your wife and kids are in my hands. If you don't have the 3 million by tomorrow, I'll sell her! Think about it... go! Hey! What's happening? Gone crazy? - Mind your own business and close the door. - Alright... Miss, who are you looking for? I'm looking for Mr. Ho. Are you Miss Dik Wan? Your TV series is just great. Really? Do you have an appointment with Mr. Ho? No... but I want to give him a surprise. You must help me. Me? We've known each other for 2 years today. You must keep this secret. Mr. Ho doesn't want anybody to know that... ...we are friends. I understand... Just pretend you don't know I've gone in. Lot of things for which I'll need your help with later. Alright then. - Maybe you just go in and have a seat. - Alright. Please sit. Thank you. Miss Dik, I'll bring you some photos later. Can you sign them for me? Sure. Thank you. Mr. Ho... I don't want to do this. I really don't. I have been wanting to discuss with you this morning, but you never gave me a chance to talk to you. I'm listening, speak. Mr. Ho, please lend me 3 million dollars. I've owed others a lot of money. My wife and kids are in their hands. Please lend me some money. Mr. Ho, you have so much money. You wouldn't care about this small sum, is that right? I can help you solve the problem, but I can't lend you any money. I hate people threatening me. Today you point a gun at me. Later on everybody can point a gun at me. You bastard! You refuse to lend me, right? Alright, I'll die with you. Put the gun down now and I won't report to the police. You lied! You treated Wong Cheung ruthlessly. Would you let me go away so easily? Let me tell you. When you step out of the lift, you'd better walk quietly to your office. If not, I'll just blow your head off. The lift is here, come on. Mr. Ho. Don't let anyone come in. I have things to talk to Hu. Yes, Mr. Ho is not taking any calls. - Don't put any calls in. - Alright. Well, give me a cup of coffee. Mr. Ho never drinks coffee. Put down the gun first, aren't you tired? No, I want to rescue my family. The loan sharks push you very hard, right? Just think, are they more powerful, or me? Once I report to the police, you can't go anywhere; where could you hide? Don't you know that I'm on a tiger's back? I can't get off. Be wise, ask Ko to bring in 3 million, and go with me to Hong Kong. If not, I'll just blow your head off, and kill myself. It's bad. Stop talking nonsense, go in! Go in! Hurry and make the call, I want 3 million. Numbers on the bills shouldn't be in series. Then go aboard the ship with me. You're so naive. You think you can return to Hong Kong? Once you land, you'll be arrested. It's a dead end. I don't care. Only you can... save yourself now. I won't make the call, you decide for yourself. Hu, you've been with me for five years. I've never treated you badly. I thought you were a talent. Put the gun down. I promise that if you give yourself up, I'll rescue your family. You have my word. How did this happen? How did this happen... Who are you? Don't shoot... You hid a woman here to eavesdrop? You despicable bastard! I really didn't know she's here. Get him! - Let me go! - Mr. Ho... Ho Sun, you despicable bastard! You'll suffer for this! Even if you don't, your kids will. Still talking! We've heard it all. You're going to jail. Ko, never mind, take him out. - Take him out! - Go... Mr. Ho, are you alright? I'm fine... How did you know I'm in trouble? You always have upset stomach after coffee, - but strangely you asked for coffee, - so something's wrong. How clever! Arrange for us all to get to the hospital. Yes. How come you are here? Well... I want to do an interview with Mr. Ho. You know I could have you apprehended. By the way, Hu's family... ...has been taken away by those loan sharks. Help me handle this. He's a traitor and you are still so good to him? I want to know if I could go down in history. Who's laughing with you? Is the lady inside okay? Yes, she's slightly wounded. I want to go in and have a look. Alright, she can go anytime. Are you alright? - Are you smoking? - No. You almost lost your life just now. You needn't die if you only want a promotion. The police said they want you back for questioning. I turned it down for you. I don't want this news to spread. There's smoke coming out of your mouth. No, the room was very cold, but it's much warmer now. That's good! When you interview me, it wouldn't be that hard. - You agree to be interviewed? - Yes. But I need to handle something first. You can interview me in the car for fifteen minutes. That's good enough. I'll wait for you in the car. Wow... Since this is a charity walk, I'll join in. Thank you Mr. Ho. About that special... - Let's talk about this later... okay? - Okay. Where are we going now? None of your business. Ko, go up with me later. Alright. Wait for me here. Oh... Mr. Ho. Sun, are you here? Your ear is getting better and better. I intended to surprise you. This house is so quiet, how would I not know if someone approaches. What happened to your hand? No big deal, got wounded while playing tennis. You are not that young now, be very careful. Mrs. Ho. Ko. Sorry, I'm late today. It's just 5:15pm. Mr. Ho is punctual. I've been with him for five years, and he always comes back before five. Shut up and deal the cards for us. Let's see who's got better luck today. Look at the cards. Here are my cards. Oh... I lost again. Lost six hundred dollars, there you go. How come you are in such good luck. Sun, Tinyee faxed in today, saying that she and Tinbou... ...will be coming back from Hawaii next week. - Coming back so soon? - Yes. She said she wants to introduce her boyfriend... ...to us. - Wow... an American boyfriend! - Yes. What if he were an American black guy, keep singing I'm Bad I'm Bad... then give me five... Look at you, a man of your age... ought to behave. What a hypocrite, there must be a woman somewhere. I'll expose you. You've come back with someone? No. Miss, come in please. Sorry. Didn't I ask you to wait downstairs? It's okay, come in. I love to watch your TV soap opera. You're great! You're too kind, Mrs. Ho. Come, have a seat. Sin. Coming... Mrs. Ho, what can I do for you? - Give Miss Dik some tea. - Yes. Pardon me. - Never mind. - Sun, how could you ask her to wait downstairs? Sin... You want to die? Softly. They are chatting, let's relax! I asked you where you went last night? You didn't even give me a call. I know you'd say you're entertaining with Mr. Ho. That's right. We're entertaining guests from Taiwan. I was drunk... ...even before we had shark's fins. Swear it! That's not necessary, is it? Say after me. If last night I came into contact with... ...females of any sort, I'll suffer poisonous boils all over my body. I'll eat shit and my share prices will plummet, my car will be stolen... ...and each night a ghost will disturb me till dawn. Sigh... you always had a sharp tongue, but its getting worse. I should be mean to you men. I bought you a watch. Really? You bought a Rolex, Piaget, Baume & Mercier, or Chopard? Come back for soup tonight... It's a Seiko. Go and eat shit... get lost! Sin... Miss, have a cup of tea please. Thanks. - It's inconvenient for me to move about, - Get out! I don't want to run around with Sun, so I live here all by myself. Sun will come and keep me company each day at five. Take Miss Dik to the pier. Yes, Mr Ho. Mrs. Ho, Mr. Ho, goodbye. Drop in when you're free. Goodbye. If you don't buy me an expensive watch, I'll engrave the words "I have AIDS" below. You can't do that. How do you know if I don't try? I would be dead before you finish. At least could finish the word 'I'. See you tonight. See you tomorrow. Not tomorrow. Why? I did the math and you'll be riding a tide. What tide? The crimson tide (menstruation). Scum! I don't see you doing math on other occasions. Damnit! What are you laughing at? Good taste! No way... you thought she and I are together? I have been paralysed for 20 years, you've been good to me. A normal man... ...should have a girl with him, otherwise he'd be abnormal. Don't be silly! I exercise, swim, so ll am normal. Look at you, you lose a few hundred to me everyday. You give up even though you've a good hand. I really hope... ...you should find a decent girl. Don't' let your mind wander! I only have eyes for you. I know you love me. But I know in your heart, she'll always be number one, and I'll be number two. I know deep in my heart. I have forgotten her. I really wouldn't mind. Don't talk about these, I'll be unhappy. - I'm going... byebye. - Alright. Mr. Ho, you have improved a lot... ...after your hand has recovered. Stop sucking up to me! Hah... can't play anymore... l am out of breath! Hey! Can't take it anymore? Sigh... not anymore. Over 10 years younger yet in a poorer condition than me. Exhausted by too much sex, that's why I'm weaker. You mock that I have no girlfriend? It's just that you don't want any. In fact Miss Dik is not bad. I wouldn't wait to go for her if I were you. Well... may get rejected. I'll think of a plan for you. Present her with a diamond watch, then take her on a trip to Europe. When have you become a pimp? I think you may feel embarrassed. In fact Miss Dik likes you. Really? How could she like an old man? Girls nowadays... ...like mature men. Really? But I don't know if you are still capable? - It's been a long time - and I don't know either? - That I can't help you with. I'm going. - Hey. It's your birthday and I want to treat you to a meal. Sorry, I already have an appointment. Could you not see Sin for a day? I'm not seeing her. I have an appointment with someone more beautiful. Really? I had never told Sin about my birthday. Please don't tell her! Alright... Mr Ko, a lady is here to see you. Alright... coming. Thanks... I am going now. Take care! Happy Birthday. Surprise. How did you come here? It's your birthday and I know you like sex, so I've come to present you with a special cake. Happy Birthday. Who is she? You ask me? What do you mean? Do I need to tell you everything? Silly! Look... what are you looking at? Lower your head when man is talking. You get back to Macau at once. Who would take the responsibility... ...if something happens to Mrs. Ho. This is dereliction of duty. I have always been proud to have a... ...responsible girl friend as you, but you disappoint me. Lower your head! I only have one feeling now. My heart aches and I cannot bear to watch. I want to play ball. You're great! I admire you... I better make this awkward situation appear casual. Let's play. Believe me, there's nothing between us. Everyone gossips. What's untrue becomes true. You lack confidence in me? It's not that. - It's just that - you haven't earned my confidence. - Cut! Next scene. - Thanks. Okay? - Miss Dik, from Mr. Ho. - Ko. Thank you. "How about dinner at the usual place?" I'll go myself, Alright. Mom, I miss you much. You've lost some weight. No I haven't. I'm more or less the same as before. Mr. Ho, you're back. Dad? Is dad back? Dad... Naughty Dad, you scare me! Let Dad look at you. I really don't understand, why you like your steak so rare? It gives me power. Humans thousands of years ago ate like this. This is a dog-eat-dog society, it's just that you don't know it. Dad. Tinbou. Dad. Come back and help dad. Of course, my good friend Ching Jan, who is also Tinyee's boy friend. How come he's not black? Mr. Ho, pleased to meet you. Hi, I believe my kids' choice, you must be very capable. Despite all that capability if there were... ...no opportunity, nothing would happen, right? Jan is very interested to... ...work in our entertainment company How much do you know about casinos? In what respects? If I asked you to manage a casino, what preparations would you make a month in advance? I would analyze the location of the casino, and distribution of the gangs. Wouldn't you learn gambling? You have experts in that area. Once everything is on track... ...that is not so important. The crucial thing is to balance interests, and give customers a safe haven to enjoy. Business will naturally be good. If not, you would not be the leader, but it would be Mr. Nip Ngoutin. Dad, Jan and I would... ...be able to help you with our talents. I fear your talents are inadequate, and make a mess of things. In Hawaii I beat up the Japanese gangsters so bad that... ...they all lay dead. Don't think I don't know, you did make those Japanese girls... ...all lie down. Let's stop talking and go have a meal. Jan, I'll give you a month's time... ...to do what you said. Come to work in a month. I'll not let you down. I admire pride in a young man... let's eat. What's the matter? Can't sleep? I'm thinking. Our kids are back, what more do you want? It's about Tinyee's boy friend. Well? You don't like them sleeping in the same room? It's a modern world now. If that kid is irresponsible, I'll castrate him. You don't behave well. His eyes remind me of someone. Who? They look familiar, but I just can't place them. You think too much... go back to sleep. Let's order a pair of golden bracelets tomorrow... ...as dowry, okay? Sleep early. You can do it... Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to our programme. Walkathon with celebrities, it's been going on for a few hours. This is Ng Sauseun reporting live... ...with my partner Big Sister Chun. That's right, donations have... ...reached 21 million. The latest news indicates that... ...the competition is keen. Little White Dragon and the Yellow Warriors teams lead. Their representatives for the final journey are... ...tycoons Kowk Yingnam... ...and the new star... ...Hong Kong Princess Chu Lamlam. There's also our top donor Mr. Ho Sun... ...and Miss Dik Wan representing the Rose team, and Mr. Nip Ngoutin leading the Peanuts team. Dad, introduce me to Chu Lamlam. Hey, Ting. As I said, anyone who parts his hair in the middle is a pervert. Flirt all you want, but don't ask for dad's help. - Should I get with her myself, you idiot! - Alright. Dad, you should talk to the teacher in English. Hey... of course I remember? Agree? Dad... she's smiling at me. Wouldn't you if you saw gold? You are a piece of gold chasing her, - of course she'll smile. - Alright. This is a great looking girl. Great figure. Well... don't you see her big hips? She'll have kids, go after her... go... - I'll go then. - Go... Hey... you follow me. - Sun. - Hey. Allow me to introduce my English teacher. Hello. Mr. Ho, Mother Fucker. Hey! Careful how you speak, understand? What do you mean? I spent a lot of money to get him... ...to specially teach me English foul language. Otherwise how could... - ...1 deal with those westerners? - Hi. Hey! I hear that recently you're pursuing the one besides you. I told you to watch your mouth. Mr Kwok, I am Dik Wan. Hi... Hey... He dates... Hey! Can you watch your tongue? Don't pretend, you idiot! What is there that I don't know? If you won't I will go... When we get to the TV station, don't shoot your mouth off. Tinyee and Tinbou are with Mui over there. You are the one speaking nonsense. You tricked them to the TV station to wait for you... ...while you flirt with girls here. Why did you trick me? We are brothers... right. Sun... you haven't had another wife all these years, you've been faithful to Mui. Nam, I am an old man. Hey! You said it, I didn't. I can take it out now, and it still works well. You can, I can't do it. Hey... Nip Ngoutin that old fox, what's wrong with him lately? I feel strange. He's been against me all the time. What an asshole! Remember when he begged us to return to Macau, he was like a dog, calling us sir... damn! Don't mention him anymore. - Let's go. - Go... coming... Ladies & gentlemen, fierce competition... ...among the Yellow Warriors & Little White Dragon teams. They'll be here soon. Dad, your turn. I know. Hurry... Your turn too. I know. Faster... Huh... - Hurry... - You... Come on, dad! I stepped on you. I did it on purpose, so? Son, - Dad"ll help you to chase that girl... - Hurry... Shit... we are so slow, we are bound to lose. - Do our best for charity, okay? - Okay. Yes, got it. There should be news... Yes... Right! Got it... I have received news. All teams have set off for the last lap. The one currently leading is... ...the beautiful Chu Lamlam, and Mr Kwok Yingnam. Do you think your dad... ...will be the last today? That would be embarrassing. You can do it... Hurry... Looks like we are bound to lose. This way it will be less strenuous. - Miss Dik Wan, please give us your autograph. - Sure. Hey! Wait for me. - I'll lose anyway, - I'll be a gentleman and wait. Miss Dik Wan, please give us your autograph, - thanks! - You're so pretty! Wow! So exciting! Seem like the champion is Miss Chu Lamlam of Yellow Warriors. Not really, Mr. Kwok Yingnam of White Dragon is catching up. Damn... Big hips! You hit the balls of a senior citizen! I've won... Yeah... I'm a lady. I've won... Won... I don't know you... I've won... I protest... I persisted till the final lap... ...1 was seriously disturned by this big hips. I protest against her win. Dad... This is a TV station! You bastard, you only have eyes for a girl. - Bullying dad with that big hips! - I like her. - I sleep with your... - This is really a TV station. It's alright, keep dancing... Guess how your dad will do? - Hey! What's wrong... Don't run! - Someone is hurting people! Yeah... This is great... Dad, she... is smiling at me again. Hey! Asshole! She has just molested... ...your dad, can you still laugh at that? Alright, I won't laugh. Let me tell you. Make an effort and go after her. You must get her. Don't make me lose face. Dare to contradict me? I'll make my son treat you right. Mother Fucker! Ko, how come Mr. Ho is not back yet? - Let me take a look. - Alright. Miss Dik Wan representing the Rose team is back. See... Dad is back. The one behind is... ...Mr. Ho representing the Sapphire team. Congratulations! Daddy. Alright... all the eight teams are back now. Here's the result. The Champion of the 1st Walkathon with celebrities... ...is the Yellow Warriors team. Yeah... The one who's got the most donation is... ...Mr. Ho representing the Sapphire team. Ko. Mrs. Ho, what is it? Mr. Ho is wounded, don't spread the news. He doesn't want others to know. Arrange a car and take him to the hospital. - Yes. - Alright. Everyone, the Walkathon with celebrities... ...has now come to an end. Thanks for watching, goodbye. Are you alright? Okay, don't let anyone know. Sun! - Dad... - Sun... - Dad... - Sun... - Dad... - Benny, are you alright? - Sun... are you alright? - Dad... - Sun... are you alright? - Dad... - Call the ambulance... hurry! - Dad... I must find those bastards. No use. If I were to kill a celebrity like Mr. Ho, I would have hired an unknown assassin. Besides, I'm alright now. He would hide and wait for the next opportunity. Security has been tightened in... ...Mr. Ho's residence and offices... - ...in Hong Kong and Macau. - Okay. - It's late, let's go back. - Alright. - Tinbou, go back with mom. - Yes. Miss Dik. What are you doing here? I come to see Mr. Ho. Since you appeared, bad things have happened to my father. Do you want to destroy our family... ...or kill my dad? Tinbou! Tinbou... don't talk nonsense. Sorry, Miss Dik. Take you time. Let's go. Mr. Ho, I go to check if the security people are here. He's right. Since you knew me, many bad things have happened to you. I fear you and I are incompatible, and that I bring you bad luck. Why do you believe in these things? Sun... I am afraid. Of what? That something might happen to you. Every time I face your wife, I feel guilty. I feel so much pressure... ...being with you. I cannot let others know, and I cannot share this with others. We can't meet any time we like. Benny, it's painful. Did I hurt you? No... I feel your pressure. I am sincere. Well... are you happy when you're with me? Yes. Alright then. But would we come to anything? May I come in? Your fourth brother? He brought me here. Please come in. Sorry. Wan, they are asking me to move my car. I'm okay, you go first. I'll wait for you downstairs. You must be careful. I will. Let's meet less in such times. I feel treachery is brewing. And I have a hunch, the enemy I face this time... ...is the worst in my life. Kung Hay Fat Choy... Hurry... greetings to Uncle Benny. Sun, I wish you the best year after year, and clean out those gamblers. May your good words come true. Sister in law, I wish you'll keep thin, and be young forever. - Tinbou, keep at it, - What? And help your dad soon. So he'll have time to accompany me to flirt with women. Still joking at this age. What are you standing there for? Give the red packets. That's why I've asked you to come. Give... or else I'll deduct the house money! - Sai Po, you take care of it. - Alright. I've prepared red packets for you. Your turn next year. Come... I've red packets for them too. Have you thanked your uncle Benny yet? Idiotis! - Thanks Uncle... - No needs to say thanks. Have to. When we play cards later, I want my capital and interest back. Sun, my son... ...is clever this time. He finally got the heart of Chu Lamlam, and will get married soon. Hey! You must come to the wedding. Sure... How is it with Dik Wan? Hey! I haven't thought about these things. As my English teacher says, Past tense means in the past. Sun, we've been blood brothers for so long, for sure I know what you're thinking. I even know what your dick wants. What's to fear, one must sow some wild oats. No English teacher lately? Don't talk about him. He called me a Chinese pig at my back. I wanted to let him get away at first. Then I thought... ...I'll better call god on the phone to discuss. God said to punish him... ...so that he broke his nose while walking in the street; also broke his teeth, his arm and his leg. You still harbour those gang? Yes... but don't get me wrong. My men haven't touched him. God punished him. You are becoming more cultured recently. I hired a Chinese teacher to teach me. He also teaches me how to write modern poetry. - Really, recite for me. - Sure. Oh... beautiful woman, you are a cloud in the sky, when I see you I get high. Very high! Dad, you are awesome! You are a sock, and ll am the foot inside. You're a hot dog, and I am the sausage inside. You are a fat ass, and I'm poo inside. Dad is great! Hey! Applaud him! Enjoy? Since we're so happy today, I'll do one more. Hey... That's enough. Sun, I've been to Karaoke frequently. - How about... let us perform a song. Come... - Great... Let's samba! Let's get drunk! Dad... let's stop singing. Hey! You always spoil your dad's fun. Am I having a special relationship with your mom? - What? - What's that mean? Be more polite, teacher has taught me. - Really can't stand him. - Sun, Mr. Nip is here. Congratulations... Congratulations... Wishing you good health, Mr. Nip, and great prosperity, SO you could retire soon. Mr. Nip, I wish you virility in your old age. Of course. May I know your name please? Well... he's just started working with me, his name is Dai Tung. Hey! You should greet Mr. Ho. Mr. Ho, hope you turn all bad luck into good. Hey! What did you say? Tinbou, go back! Mr. Nip, how did you teach your men? How can he say such unlucky things in a new year. I'm so sorry! Dai Tung, what day is today? How can you say such things? I'm just a kid and don't know much. Please forgive me Mr. Ho. Never mind. A pair of Aces... Mr. Nip, it's your call. A pair of Aces... I'll put in five hundred thousand. I'll follow. I'll see if you're bluffing. I'll put in additional one million. Sun, your turn. What? I'll follow. It may be a pair of jacks and ten, or three Jacks. Tough luck you run into me. I'll follow, and an additional three million. Mr Nip is great! If afraid, don't follow. And you too. Hey, Asshole! You are not welcome here, get out! Do I need to do as you say? If I leave, someone may harm Mr. Nip. Then I'll kill you first! Tinbou! Stay calm. I'm so sorry... please forgive his ignorance. Continue to play... come. No big deal, but there are times... ...when you have to give face to the master. You've been in charge of the casino for many years, but don't forget we still have a couple of shareholders here. If business is not good, you'll be dismissed even we're old friend. 3 million, following or not? 3 million, I'm not afraid of you. Sun, don't be afraid of him, I'll support you. Follow and add ten million. Even if you've gotten 3 Kings, aren't you afraid I have 3 Aces? I wonder if he'll follow? Things change. Draw the cards. Nam, this Jack should be yours. That's right... Damn it! I should've 3 Jacks. I've told you before, things change. My call, showhand! You are really not afraid of my 3 Aces? You have 3 Aces? Thought I'll showhand instead of you asking for "show". That's right. Sun, you're great! Today is the second day of the lunar year, we still have a whole year to play with it. I quit. I don't believe that you have 3 Aces. I've only got a pair of Kings. I just don't understand why you didn't follow. You lack guts in your old age? You've won and you still want to take advantage! You obviously don't give my boss face. I'm going to beat you bastard up. Tinbou, how dare you talk like this in here. You think this is your territory... - ...so I have to be afraid of you? - It's not your turn to talk here either. Dai Tung, stop! I'll deliver the money to you tomorrow... let's go. You'd better watch out! Mr. Nip... Damn, this old fart! Causing trouble in the new year. I didn't abuse him enough. Sun, never mind him... let's play card. Dad, why didn't you let me hit him? You are supposed to be educated, why such violence? I've sent you to study abroad, what've you achieved? You've studied shit? - You should learn from Jan. - Tinbou... Tinbou, stop quarrelling with your father. How come you are not on my side. That's not true. Stop it! I'm so mad! Let's go for a drive, come on! Tinbou... don't drive too fast! Mom, what should we do? Blackjack. These people have been winning for six days. Just playing blackjack but they win more than losing, and they always win on big bet. They almost always win on big bets. Did you search them? Why do you suspect them? Calculator. Even if they have it, they didn't take it out. We didn't notice they swapped cards, or made marks on the cards. Even Mr. Nip couldn't see their tricks, I don't think they are swindlers. They must have used tricks, it's just that we were deceived. - Dai Tung, go down and ask them to leave. - Yes, good. Don't... Master Nip, you didn't agree to do this previously. It's different now. Now the real pros have come to take advantage of us, we must teach them a lesson. If we use force, I won't agree to that. You object? Alright, settle this at... ...tomorrow's Board meeting. Sun, these people have won over 30 million dollars. We can't tell what they have done. You've got to stop this. What're you insinuating? I haven't conspired with them. I didn't say that. I just don't want to see them here again. I've checked it out, these people have no records... ...in casinos all round the world. That is to say they're not professionals. Unless they are proved to be swindlers, they are gambling legally. I didn't say they are not allowed to win. But I want them to know, if they keep on winning, everybody will be unhappy. Didn't the Dice Gang win... ...as much money in those years? You advocate letting people go easily. We are running a casino, winning and losing is common. You taught me this, right? Mr. Nip, not everyone could be... ...as aggressive as you as you grow old. Some people may regress. Guts diminish with age, haven't you heard that? It's not your turn to speak, you're only a junior. Bastard, what's your background? We are having a meeting, not a triad negotiation. Sit down... Mr. Ho, there's nothing to fight against. We'd better think of something and vote on it. Good idea. Sounds more civilized. You are in charge of this casino. You'd better handle those swindlers... ...in the next 24 hours. If not, I'll take charge of the casino. If you don't have the guts, I do. If you don't have manpower, I do. I first arrived in Macau with just ten dollars. Now with some luck I am established. My humble business... ...has grown into an empire. Everyday, someone wants to kill me. Everyday, someone wants me dead. I could survive until now, is no sheer luck. You now dare to threaten me with a junior. Who is he? Is it a joke? You know I hate kidding around. I'm not joking either. You have no guts, bastard! Threaten me in such condition. Are you capable? You were incapable back then. Don't think I wouldn't fight you... ...when I'm wearing a suit. I too can be a thug when I take off my tie. You need not be afraid. I am a man with principles. Whoever treats me nicely, I'll treat him nicely too. Whoever is harsh on me, I can be even harsher. As the Director of the Board, I'm ordering you to put down your cigar. There're rules for everything... ...in this room. Did you work in casinos for over 20 years for nothing, just shit? You better realize who's the boss. Good to be obeident. Alright, those who agree to let... ...Mr. Nip handle the customers... ...after 24 hours, please raise your hands. Dad told me to stand on your side no matter what. No need to literally stand on my side. - Go back and sit down... - Yes. I think it's more fair... ...to every shareholder. Mr. Ho, don't you have anything to say? - Mr. Nip, don't worry, - I still have 24 hours. - You'll see tomorrow who is without guts. - Go. - Mr Ho, are you alright? - Uncle... I'm fine... Brother, take good care of yourself at your age. Sex kills. Mr. Nip, you still have a dog over there. I'll get the doctor. - No need, - take the video tape back to Hong Kong. I've to find out how they won our money. - Yes. Mr. Ho. They've tried their best to clean Tinbou up. Mr. Ho. I'm alright, take him out and let me have a look. Why? Why're you treating my son like this? Someone saw Tinbou being hit by a cement truck. How about Jan? Where was he at that moment? He said he's got a flat tire. A cab passed by and helped him change it. We now have a secret enemy around us. I'd think it's done by Nip Ngoutin. No, he was quarrelling with me just now. It's too obvious to kill my son like that. He's a patient man. Then who could it be? I don't know. Spend some money and get some information on this. Pass the word around to all the seniors. Whoever finds out who the murderer is, I'll owe him a favour. Many other gangs are helping us on their own will. Block the news and don't let Mrs. Ho know. I understand. They don't seem like swindlers. I feel the same way too. Looks like they were doing some calculations. Our casino doesn't allow clients to bring in calculators. They didn't have pen or paper, how can they calculate? People shake and luck will go; Tree shakes and leaves fall. He's shaking all the time, how could he win? Not true, they have won us over 10 million. Which one? See... That one. Hey... Zoom in on him. Morse code. There's a small coding machine hidden in the shoe. They convey their signal to a hotel room. Someone there do the calculations for them, and then transmitting it back. How to let them know? See... That was his partner. He's got a hearing aid, it's actually a receiver. When the calculations are done in the room, they forward the message to him, then he controls the stakes. Did he win the most? Yes. So they were not swindlers, they are mathematicians. I've a plan to make them return all the money. Don't use these old card boxes again. From now on, for Baccarat and Blackjack, use these boxes. Also use 4 decks of cards for Blackjack. Mr.Ho, why's that? The new card box has got a cover, even if the swindler leaves a mark, when we deal the cards, they couldn't see... ...the mark being left on the first card. Also, some gamblers like to calculate, that's why we use 4 decks. The order combinations of cards will be increased manifold. But they could be calculated at the end. That's why we have a white card. Each time before we deal, we ask a customer to insert it into the deck. When it appears, it means the deck is finished. To prevent argument, no matter the last player wants a card or not, a card will be drawn out when it comes to the house. Everyone understand? Yes... Draw a card... What's that? New card box. From today onwards, we'll use 4 decks of cards. Though complicated, - we could still calculate it, go gamble. - Alright. - Sir, fruits for you. - Okay. Don't move... The next 5 cards are in our favour, we've a high chance of winning, increase the stakes. Shit! Wait, come over there! What do you want? Over there... Don't move... Mr. Ko. Mr. Ho. Very nice indeed. I bet you've nothing more to say. I suppose you've lost everything. I've prepared the boat tickets for you. I'll let you go this time, but don't ever let me see you again. - Let's go back. - Yes. Mr. Nip. Damn it! Swindler! Don't let them go! Never mind them! What's going on? I want to catch them all. You nab those I've released, you're not giving me face. I've reported to the police, - swindlers must be arrested. - You... Mr. Ho, are you alright? Mr. Ho, how can you let swindlers go? You're not in good health, better get sick leave from the Board of Directors. You... That's right, Jan is good enough to replace you. You'd better take a rest. Hurry and take Mr. Ho to the hospital. Hurry! Make way... Mr. Ho has gotten a heart attack and is hospitalised. Doctor says that he shouldn't work in the next 6 months. So Nip Ngoutin will replace him as the Board Chairman... ...with immediate effect. He has also promoted Ching Jan as General Manager. A great storm has just begun. Sin. What are you doing here? After young master passed away, Mr. Ho has been depressed everyday. I was forced to be angry like him. I have been in a bad temper everyday. My lip and eyes are squeezed together. So what? I want to relax. Relax? I'll do facial for you. Facial? How to do? On the face, rub it... You'll feel comfortable after that. Not facial, how about something else? What? Dick massage! Dick massage? You... are shameless! How could you talk dirty stuff, shameless! Hey... are you trying to kill me? Miss... Why are you so happy? Nothing, in fact I'm very depressed. - Alright, the dead can't come back. - Yes. Hey, if you don't want to do dick massage for me, how about I do boobs massage for you? Boobs massage! You bastard! What are you doing? You should know what you've done. What are you talking about? What am I talking about? Don't pretend to be stupid. How come there's a woman's picture in your pocket? Are you crazy? Look at the picture. It's an old one. It's losing color. That woman is at least 90 years' old. Give it back to me. No. Give it back to me. No. I'm asking you for the last time, give it back to me. Who's this bitch? Go away! Congratulations, Benny! Congratulations! - Your wife is so beautiful, - I must congratulate you. Thank you, I'll treasure it. - Sin, help me pour some tea. - Yes. This woman is so beautiful. I bought it from an antique shop, give it back to me. Just help pamper my daughter first, I'll return it to you later. Okay. I'm so worried about Mr. Ho. He has been so depressed. He's losing his spirit. - You'd better go and find another job. - Yes. Mr. Nip wants to talk to you, get in the car. Mr. Ko, you've nothing much to do at Mr. Ho's. Come and work with me instead? My pleasure. I'll let you be the casino's Chief Supervisor, only Jan is above you. Mr. Nip... what about me? You are the third in command. Do you think you're clever? Ask your girlfriend to come over too. My pleasure. What can she do? What did she do at Mrs. Ho's place? Help her bathe, washing underwear. Then do the same here. Help you bathe? No problem at all, I seldom bathe. What about washing the underwear? No problem either, I don't wear underwear. - My pleasure. - My pleasure. The monthly salary for the two of you... ...will be $50,000. - My pleasure. - My pleasure. You'll be in charge of one casino hall. - My pleasure. - My pleasure. I'll also take care of your kid's education expenses, and there'll be one month's annual leave. - My pleasure. - My pleasure. You'll be provided with accommodation. - My pleasure. - My pleasure. Then start working tomorrow. That's not possible. Why not? I have no pride, no shame, no feelings, no conscience, - but I still have a little integrity. - Yes. Mr. Ho is in trouble. I can't leave him... Asshole! Bastard, how despicable, get off the car! My pleasure. I will take my revenge sooner or later. You were really cool earlier. I'm always like this, needless to say... Sin. How should I reward you? Tonight I'll... Do whatever you want I want to go to nightclub tonight. Go to hell! See... Sun, you neither smoke nor drink, you appear to be a good man, but you've got a heart attack after all. Sun, what happened to you? You have become so weak? You should learn from me. Hey doctor, to be frank with you, - I'm addicted to all vices. - Hey... I womanize, gamble, drink, and I smoke, all together. Also, I have sex all night. Not only that, afterwards I go... ...play football immediately, and tennis too. I'm as strong as a bull. Fore hand, back hand, so deadly! Let me rest for a while. How come the corridor outside is so long. Wipe away your sweat. Thank you. If I learned from you, I'd be dead. Nonsense, you want me to be dead soon? Hurry and recuperate. Get better and I'll kick you back to Macau. That bastard Nip Ngoutin, how could he take your place. - Mother Fucker Asshole! - Hey. Sorry Monkey, sorry. I'm sorry, I've got something to discuss with him. - Alright, have a nice chat. - Yes. Sun, you are doing this everyday, aren't you bored? Sun what are you doing? You want to die? Be careful! You've a weak heart. Be careful... Hey... Do I look like I have a weak heart? Mother fucker bloody hell, are you pretending? Use your mind, if I don't pretend to be sick, that cunning Nip Ngoutin... ...wouldn't have exposed himself. Sun, do you really think I am that stupid? I knew from the very start that you've got plans, how could your health have deteriorated so suddenly, how could I be fooled. What do you intend to do? I don't trust anyone now, only you can help me. Of course, I can help you with anything, except my dick. Nam, I knew that you've got the gang. Would you lend it to me? The tiger's going to show its fury, right? I don't mind myself, but I must find out who killed Tinbou. Taste good? Of course, come again. Hey... could you two stop showing off for a while? My brother hasn't had his way yet. Never mind him. I said no... you're shameless! What sort of a friend is this. There're enemies! Go! Hurry! Big brother, it's done. Help to put his dick back in. Yes... Don't run... chase! Don't run! Don't move... I know that you've killed Ho Tinbou. Who sent you? Speak. I have my principles. - I won't speak even I've to die. - Speak! Tough guy. See if your wife is as tough. Drag her to the room. - No... dear... - What do you want? I'm afraid you are too short... ...to satisfy your wife. So I've asked a few friends to give you some help. - Don't do that! - Dear... If you touch my wife, I'm going to kill you. With what? Brothers, have a good time. Dear... - Dear... - Don't move! Dear... The black guy has a huge Johnny, she wouldn't be able to take it much longer. I'll speak... but first let go of my wife. Who's the mastermind? Is it Nip Ngoutin? No, it's Mr. Ching. Mr. Ching? It's Ching Jan... hurry, hurry to let my wife go. Come out. What does this mean? I've just let you see a special show. The woman who got banged is called Horny Lin. She's your wife's replacement. Just now she dressed up as a man, and went in with them. We don't do such mean things. We have not touched a hair of your wife's. You're something. Ching Jan. Yes... 3774 Diamond Hill, Honolulu, Hawaii. Is this address correct? My friend in Hawaii found this out for me. It should be correct. How's Mr. Ho? He's chatting outside. Sun, what those guys said... ...might not be true. Whether it's true or not, I can tell. Ko. Mr. Ho. Ngau B and Chyun Bill are quarrelling again? - Worse than last time, some got killed. - Alright. Make it look good. Are you going to that charity basket ball match? Why not? I keep my word. But there's a lot of rumours saying... ...Dai Tung will kill you. I'm not afraid of people planning against me. I've been well prepared for that. How could I run my business if I fear even this? Go. Sun, we have been buddies for so many years. No matter what you do, I'll always be on your side. But this time I must advise you to think very carefully. Tinbou is dead, Jan is your son-in-law. If you Kill him, Tinyee will be broken hearted. Nam, I've never thought of killing him. It's god who will be punishing him. On the day of his funeral, I'll be the one who'll cry most. - Understand? - Yes. We would like to see Mrs. Vivian Ching. Yes, she's right in the garden. Are you Mrs. Ching? Haven't seen you for so many years, never expect to see you today. The sky is so grey, I think I am truly an unfortunate person. My heart is greyer than the sky. I am a Catholic, I never believe in fortune-telling. But if I really have to check it, I must be having a hard life. I was ill-treated after mom died when I was just a kid. My leg was paralyzed when I was 20 something. Maybe I'm doomed not to be worthy... ...of having a good husband like Sun. It's god who makes me a condition for exchange. I'm no better. I've never in my life done harm to other people. How come at my old age... ...such disasters fall upon my children? I just don't understand. Ching Jan is your son. What about him? You don't know what he did? He's been an introvert since he was a child. He worked in Hong Kong after he graduated. He writes to me once every two months. He's now taking the place of Sun, and forced Sun to nowhere. He's avenging his father, isn't it? Don't you know his plan for revenge? He started dating my daughter at the university, don't you know that? Don't say anymore! He's the son of Fu Kachun. Avenging his father is not unexpected, but he's too ruthless. - How can this be... - He's your son, and he goes by your surname Ching. Actually his name is Fu Jan. He wants to bring harm to our whole family, doesn't he? He is my son, but his father is not Fu Kachun. This secret has been with me for over twenty years. "Forget not, forget not." "Forget not your faults, forget not your goodness." "Forget not the strolls in the rain."” Even he doesn't know it himself, his father is Sun. Everyone, Hong Kong-Macau Celebrity Basket Ball Match has begun. Captain of the Star Team is Mr. Tsui Sifat. Captain of the Celebrities Team... ...is Mr. Ho Sun who has just recuperated... ...and doing his best for charity. Our prize presenter is Mr. Lee Jihang, Mr. Choy Chungfai, and the Chairman, Mr. Nip Ngoutin. - Big brother. - He's the one that I'm going over to greet. Mr. Ho, congratulations! Mr. Ching. Don't think you've got many men, I've brought men from ten boats today. I for sure will fight for But Ye Tin territory. Are you trying to threaten me? I fear you not. I've seen all kinds of threats. But Ye Tin is my territory, You're insane to think I'll just give it to you. Fuck you! You're just a piece of iron in the fire, have to be beaten up, right? - Why do I need to fight as you said? - Let's fight... Calm down, everyone. We are all here for the money, not to fight. Let's talk this out. You should send the King of Ghosts in brother Sun's absence. Now send over a kid... ...to talk to us. That means you look down on us. I'm the General Manager here. I'll be responsible if anything happen here. How boastful! Kid, where are you from? Can you create two But Ye Tin... ...and they must be equally popular? Alright, let's talk this out. You think you can settle this? He's got Sun's daughter, and then kicked out his father-in-law. I heard that Sun's son was killed by him too. Be careful, he might kill you too. Don't worry, can he do it? You mock my big bother? Go to hell! Chop him... Run... It's 17 minutes into the second half. Yes, thanks to Mr. Ho's marksmanship, - he's closer to winning. - That's right. - Three minutes more before the end of the match. - Yes. Congratulations... Brother Sun is great. We owe it all to you. Brother Sun is great... Come on, lift brother Sun up, okay? Hey... Be careful! Tung, what is it? Nothing. Mr. Ho, this side... Mr. Ho... That's great! Mr. Ho, are you safisfied with the total money rasied? What do you think? How much are you aiming to rasie next time? That's great... - Hurry... - Kill him Watch out those three guys. Mr. Ho, you're still so sharp. Brother Tung, congratulations! It's him. Don't move, you are suspected of inciting murder. We are arresting you, - come back with us. - No. That's great... Please look over here to take a picture. I like this feeling of winning, so I'd never lose. What are you doing... Are you insane? Sorry... - In there. - Yes. Sun... - Hey? Mom. - Mom... - Mrs. Ho. - Hold it. Where have you been these days? Have you done anything to Jan? Nothing... I didn't do anything. I went to Hawaii to look for Jan's mother. Why did you go to Hawaii? - She's Ching Lokyee. - What? Dad, who's Ching Lokyee? Shut up! Sun... come over here. What is it? Lokyee said Jan is not the son of Fu Kachun, he's yours. How can it be? Mom, what's going on? Tell me. Mom... tell me... Don't ask me anymore... Tinyee... What I've done wrong? What have I done? Don't run! Why are you running after me? You aren't coming here to talk. Why do you want to kill me? You should know what you've done. Jan. Mr. Ho, you have come yourself. You killed my dad years ago & now you can kill me too. Come... Jan... Go away, bitch, you think I'm really in love with you. I'm using you, first I woo you - then I dump you. - Jan, it's not true... I want you bastards to have hard times. Jan... no... you really love me, you've said. Jan... You're putting on a show. Can a wolf cry? Bastard! Shut up! You can scold anyone... ...but not Mr. Ho. Why not? Let me tell you, my name is Fu Jan. I am the son of Fu Kachun. Jan, you are actually... No... don't tell. Why... Mrs. Ho, calm down. You promised me on the plane. Why? What're you waiting for? Get rid of the problem forever. Kill me and no one will seek revenge from you. Sun, it's a mess upstairs, don't you know that? Wow... it's a mess here too. Asshole, it's your retribution today. Come on all of you. I'm preapred for it, damn you! You don't believe I'll cut your dick out. Come out, come. Sun, why are you holding me up? You're still protecting him, he got you into this mess. Jan is the son of Ching Lokyee. Ching Lokyee's son is the son of Fu Kachun. The bastard wants to come here for revenge, and also takes the heart of Tinyee. Bastard, I'm going to kill him. He isn't the son of Fu kachun. He's the son of Ching Lokyee. Then he's the son of Fu Kachun, unless Ching Lokyee had an affair with another man. Affair with another man? Wouldn't it be you? Yes. I don't understand what I've have done wrong... ...to have caused incest and feud among brothers. This is the biggest loss... ...ll suffer in this life, so much that I can't get back on my feet. Sun don't worry... you didn't lose... What are you talking about? You didn't lose... I'm so smart. I Kwok Yingnam is really so smart. What are you talking about? Make it clear to me. You asked me to bet on banker and I bet on player so did not lose. Did you remember that... ...Mui was beaten up badly - by Fu Kachun? - Yes. - She ended up paralysed. - Yes. When she was in the hospital, the doctor said she lost her child. I was afraid that you and Mui would be sad, so I forced the doctor to buy a child, and pretend that she was yours. That child is... - She is... - She is Tinyee. Yes... that's right. Did you lie to me? You really didn't lie to me? Why should I... Sun? For so many years, the only thing I didn't tell you... ...was that I got syphylis in my 20s. - When have I ever lied to you? - Okay. Thank you, thank you so much! Really... don't be like this. What a shame to cry at our age. You should stop crying too, stop crying. When you go in later, don't speak out. Just whisper... ...to Mui only, understand? Yes... I know, I will be smart! Thank you! It's alright. You tell her. Jan, I've something to tell you. Stop wasting your breath. You look like shit! You may leave. What tricks are you up to now? If not for the fact that my daughter loves you, I wouldn't let you off so easily. You will regret it if you let me go. I won't. I hope you won't come back again after you leave. I don't want to see you again. Ho Sun, you are stupid to let me go, I'll definitley take your offer. I will be back. Then they didn't commit incest? No. Make way. Jan. I will be back. Mom. Alright, it's alright, you are my daughter, you are always my daughter. My lovely daughter, it's alright now. I must talk to you. What happened today is not my idea. It's that bastard Dai Tung acting on his own. I know you don't believe me, but I must tell you. I believe you. I always understand well my enemy. You won't play such dirty tricks. Thank you for thinking highly of me. - Ko, take Mrs. Ho and Tinyee back. - Yes. - I've got things to talk to Master Nip. - Sun... what do you want now? Come on, go back first. Sister in law... go back first. - Nam, close the door. - Yes. Today we must settle all our grudges. How? If we go on like this, someone's bound to fool us, and we'll suffer great losses. Let's settle it in this room, no one will know what happened today. What do you want to do? I have always wanted to beat you bastard up. I'll fight you alone. Fight you alone? It isn't fighting, just you're beating me up. You have no choice. Nam, keep watch. No problem. You needn't do this. Alright, people in this room are used to casting votes. Whoever supports me beating this bastard up, please raise your hands. I support. You lose. However, I fear people say I bully you for your age. I'll let you make 3 moves, come. You said it. Wow, Sun! Wow! So deadly! Of course! You thought just because you're 20 odd years younger, you could bully me. I tell you, my leg was considered famous... ...when I was a bouncer at a theatre in China. Those people who came without paying for the ticket, ...Kicked them out. My kick even dislocated their jaws. It's called the King of Kicks. - Here's the second kick. - Nam! Old bastard! You said one to one... hey! - Who would have time for you? - Come. Two against one, that's not fair! Hey... Sun, let's beat him up together. You hit my dick, I'll hit your old dick! Nothing is fair-play in this world, just victory or defeat matters! Oh... my dick... No one knows who won the fight. It was rumoured that... ...after Kwok Yingnam was hit in the balls, his visits to night clubs dropped... ...from 6 to 3 times per week. And Nip Ngoutin left the... ...Macau Entertainment Company after a week. Miss Dik... come in. Have a seat... Mrs. Ho. Thanks for what you've done. I'll be most willing to... - ...help Mr. Ho anyway I can. - Yes. See if you like it or not? Mrs. Ho. Just a small token. This was supposed to be my daughter's dowry, But now... I can't accept such an expensive gift. Accept it. Is it okay if I call you Wan? No problem at all. Wan, I know you like Sun very much. I like you too. Mrs. Ho. I've been paralysed for over 20 years, Sun and I are only husband and wife in name. I've been wanting to find a nice girl... ...to live with me, and be like a sister. I can even divorce Sun... ...in order to let you be the real Mrs. Ho. I wouldn't mind all this. No, it can't be. Don't tell me you don't like Sun. Although I'm a bit stupid, my eyesight is not yet dimmed. I'm too headstrong, I'm not suitable for Mr. Ho. Tell me which Hong Kong girl isn't headstrong. The most important thing is you love each other. You are a celebrity, I'll ask Sun to arrange it with all pomp & grandeur. I'd like to have a few words with Benny. Yes, sure... Go have a chat... go... - Benny. - Yes... Your wife asked me to marry you. She discussed this with me; she seems an open-minded person. Please return this to your wife. I don't deny that I liked you. But we both have too many past stories, there'll be trouble if we are together. Never mind what others will say. Of course I care, Benny. When others point their fingers at you behind your back, you'll feel the pressure. It's not the first time that I'm with a married man. I know it very clearly. So you asked the little actor to wait for you downstairs. I've promised to marry him. I've no pressure to be with him. Though Mrs. Ho is not able to walk, she stood by you and supported you... ...in your most difficult times. She is the one who loves you most. I feel so ashamed in front of her. Mrs. Ho has told me... ...that she was only placed second in your heart. Don't you feel sorry to her? I'm leaving, don't contact me again. Maybe I'll send you a card at Christmas. Benny. He's been waiting for me for a long time downstairs. How's it going? Congratulations, Mrs. Ho! You are in fact the one he loves most. - Goodbye. - Hey... She said she wanted to return this to you. So everything is fine now. You don't look happy? Got any cigarettes? Yes. You haven't smoked for a long time. I think... it's better for me to smoke again. See how happy they are. Sin, there's something I'd like to talk to you, but I don't know how to say it. What is it? It's something to do with the future of both of us, and our kids too. I must do it. I thought you'd never say it. You know already? How would I know... if you don't tell? I thought it's easy, not realising that it's so difficult. You must promise me. But I've to think about it. So annoying! Indeed it's really so hard to say it. Actually it'll take only half an hour. I knew it when you took the flowers. I like to hear you say, say it. You hold it first. Hurry up and say it, say it. I have passed my syphillis to you, let's go and see the doctor together. Damn you! Go to hell... What are you thinking about? I'm thinking about someone. Who is it? Now I have only you in my heart, of course I'm thinking of you. Mr. Ho, can I have your autograph please? Can you tell me your secret of success? - However difficult it is, never admit yourself a failure. - Yes. "Forget not, forget not." "Forget not your faults, forget not your goodness." "Forget not the strolls in the rain."” "Forget not the embraces in the wind." "Forget not, forget not." "Forget not your tears, forget not your smiles.” "Forget not the melancholic falling of leaves.” "Forget not the worries of blossoms."
