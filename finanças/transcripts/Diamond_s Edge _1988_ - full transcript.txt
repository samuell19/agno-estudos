[ meows ] [ trolley bell rings ] Boy: There's not much call for private detectives in Camden Town. Business had been so bad, even the cockroaches were walking out on us. And I'd have gone with them if I had anywhere to go, but my parents had emigrated to Australia, and I was stuck with my big brother Herbert. It was the second week in December, and the way things were going, it looked as if the turkeys would be having a merrier Christmas than me. No credit. I'll pay you next week. You said that last week. We're going to starve up there. You have my sympathy, but this is a supermarket, not a charity. Just one tin of beans? You wouldn't miss a tin of beans. You've got lots of beans. You'll put me out of business, you and your brother. Here. My brother. His real name is Herbert Timothy Simple, but he called himself Tim Diamond, Inc. [ chuckles ] The only ink in the place was in the pens. What did you get? Beans, more bills, and a Christmas card from Mum. A koala in a Christmas tree? How do you want the beans? How 'bout baked? There's no gas. Well, use a candle. We're out of candles. Oh, just open 'em, Nick. I can't. You pawned the tin opener. Herbert, why can't you get yourself a job? You don't understand, Nick. Jobs just don't come out of the blue. No, they come out of a job center. You mean a job job? Well, how much longer can you just sit here waiting for someone to knock on the door? [ knock on door ] Tim: Come in. Take a seat. Are you Tim Diamond? Yeah. My name is Naples, Johnny Naples. Oh, Italian. South American. Diamond, Tim Diamond. I know it. How do you know? You just told me. All right, let's cut the introductions. What can I do for you, Mr. Navels? Who is he? He's just my kid brother. You want a cushion? I want to leave something with you. What did you have in mind? A package... ...this package. You must not open it. Keep it safe for two or three days. Then I'll come back for it. What's inside it? That my business. All right. Let's talk about my business. I'm not cheap, Mr. Nipples. You want a cheap private eye, you look in the cemetery. We're talking about a flat fee, plus expenses, and my expenses... are expensive. There's £100. 100?! I'll give you another 100 when I come back for it. Just make sure you look after the package. Guard it with your life, Mr. Diamond. It's in safe hands. [ cup shatters ] Yeah, I can see that. - Hey, wait a minute. - What? What happens if we need to get in touch with you? You don't get in touch with me. I get in touch with you. You hear it? I think we ought to open the package. No, the package stays here, and you open it over my dead body. I just hope nobody else does. We spent half the money paying off Mr. Patel. We blew the rest on a decent meal and a movie. I let Herbert choose the movie. Philip, for short. Philip Marlowe, name for a duke. [ chuckles ] You're just a nice mug. I've got a name for a duchess, Mrs. Lewin Lockridge Grayle. You know too much. - [ gunshot ] - [ music playing ] You don't call me. I hear it, so I come up. I'd like to talk to Velma now. It didn't work out the way I planned, Moose. You got a refund coming. Moose: You shouldn't have killed her. Marlowe: Moose. You shouldn't have killed Velma. Moose, listen to me! [ gunshot ] Why did Moose Malloy want to kill Mrs. Grayle? Because she turned him in to the cops. But that was Velma Valento. Mrs. Grayle was Velma Valento. Then what about the stolen necklace? There was no stolen necklace. Marriott went to the canyon to kill Marlowe, but Velma double-crossed him. So it was Velma Valento who strangled Jessie Florian? No, that was Moose Malloy. Oh, well, I knew he was up to no good. I mean, with a name like Moose. Herbert. The package! Herbert. They've got the package. Herbert. It's-- Yes. You took it to the cinema? It was in my pocket. But did you stop to think about pickpockets? Herbert. Good work, kid. [ phone rings ] [ rings ] [ rings ] Hello. - Is that Tim Diamond? - Yes, it is. - You like a Turkish bath? - Yes, I do. You heard of the Turkish baths in Green Street? Yes. I have. Be there at 12:00 tomorrow. Yes, I will. You'd better be. - Yes. - [ dial tone ] Who was it? It was the Fat Man. Nick: You're really scared of this Fat Man, aren't you? No, I'm not. You're sweating. Of course I'm sweating. We're in a Turkish bath. Why here? Look, you don't ask why, Nick. When the Fat Man tells you to be somewhere, you just turn up, and you're grateful he didn't kill you before you arrived. Lawrence. That's the Fat Man? You are Tim Diamond? Yeah. I am the Fat Man. You don't look so fat to me. And who are you? Nick, Nick Diamond. I'm his brother. I had a brother once. He died of an unfortunate affliction. What was that? He talked too much. Hmm? My doctor advised me that I needed to lose weight, and so he put me on the "F" plan diet, which means that I'm only allowed to eat on Fridays. What do you think? Now, Timothy, you have something that I need, a package. Last night, my representatives looked for it in your office, and they were unable to find it, and I want it. How much would you pay for it? Nick! [ laughs ] You are an amusing boy. I'm sure the nurses are going to be glad to have you in intensive care. But what makes you so sure we've got it? You were visited yesterday by a small friend of mine. He was carrying it when he went into your office, but not when he came out. He didn't leave anything with us, - did he? - Didn't he? N-no, he didn't. Right. Well, let's play it your way. If you want to find out what the bottom of the Thames looks like on a dark winter's night, that's your affair. On second thought, Timothy, if you do change your mind, you can contact me here. I'm a patient man. I can give you, oh, 48 hours. Thank you, Lawrence. I want that package. Do you understand? I will have it, and you'd be most unwise to stand in my way. [ buzzer sounds ] Hello. You must be Tim Diamond. - Who are you? - Charlady. Charlady? I saw your ad in the supermarket window, "Charlady required." Oh, the cleaner. Right. Well, what's your name? Charlady. Elizabeth Charlady. That's my name, but you can call me Betty. Oh. That's quite a party you've had in here, Mr. Diamond, but I don't mind. I like a good knees-up meself. Well, I used to, but these days, I haven't really got the knees. When can you start? Whenever suits you, Mr. D. I could start right now if you like. How 'bout tomorrow? Oh, tomorrow. Right you are, then. 9:00, bright and early. How much do you charge? Oh, he's quick, isn't he? He's a clever boy. I can see that. He's lovely. Here, how'd you get your-- How much? Two quid a hour, and I bring - me own tea bags. - Fine. I'll see you tomorrow morning, then, 9:00 on the dot. Lovely. Ta-ta. Weird. It's red. What is it? Some sort of box. Chocolates? Maltesers. [ water bubbling ] I don't get it. They really are Maltesers. What were you expecting? I don't know. Look, we've looked at the box, and we've looked at the chocolates. And they're ordinary Maltesers, right? Yeah. So why does Johnny Naples pay us 100 quid to look after them? You tell me. The only answer is to find the dwarf. He didn't leave an address. No, but he left us a clue. Come on. 8p. That's cheap for a box of Maltesers. That's not the price of the Maltesers. That's the price of the envelope. So what? Look at the name, Hammetts. That must be the stationer's where he bought it. If we can find the newsagent, maybe we can get a lead on the dwarf. There. [ girls laugh ] [ entry bell rings ] A dwarf, you say? Sure. Came in yesterday, 2:17 P.M. Yes, he was wearing a camel-hair coat, a silk suit, a fedora, smoked some funny kind of cigarettes, and had a gold ring on his left hand. How do you remember all that? "Reader's Digest," November issue, "10 Ways to Improve Your Memory." Right. He bought an envelope and a pair of scissors. He could have got the scissors free with "Woman's Weekly," but I guess he was in too much of a hurry. Seemed a nervous kind of a guy. - Yeah? - Yeah. And I didn't need to read the July edition of "Practical Psychologist" to tell you that. Kept looking over his shoulder, as if he was being followed or something. Hey, are you really a private eye? That's right. Only, I got the November issue of "True Detective" in. No, thanks. "Police Journal." No. Look-- This fella you're looking for, you'll find him in the hotel at the end of the road, Hotel Splendide. - Uh-huh. - How do you know that? Well, the owner buys his magazines here. [ whimpering ] [ belches ] [ bell rings ] Leave this to me. You Jack Splendide? Who wants to know? Name's Diamond. I'm a private eye. You don't say. We're looking for a guy who's staying here, a small guy. His name is Johnny Naples. He owes a client of ours a lot of bread. That's right, and if we find him, we'll cut you in for a slice. 25. Room 25. 25%. Room 39. Do you think this is a good idea? Have you got a better one? We could go home. Come on. [ thumping ] No. [ grunting ] [ object clatters ] - [ gunshot ] - [ groans ] Herbert! Oh, no. [ footsteps clanking ] [ dog barking ] [ groans ] The Falcon. The sun. [ gasps ] Nick. [ dog barking ] Hold it right there. You're under arrest. [ sirens blaring ] [ onlookers chattering ] Evening, sir. Sorry to drag you out on such an awful night. Hold it. Is this the body? No, sir. That's the detective. He fainted. [ chuckles ] Ah, God. What should we do with him, sir? Why, make him a nice strong cup of tea, and then nick him. Right. And who are you? I'm his brother, Nick. Nick him as well. Herbert Timothy Simple. [ laughs ] What's this you're calling yourself? Tim Diamond, private eye. [ laughs ] Pull the other one. Hello, Inspector Snape. Chief Inspector, no thanks to you. Do you want me to... Not yet, Boyle. Now, and this must be your little brother. Yeah. Bad luck, old son. Bad luck. How 'bout him, sir? Relax, Boyle. So, Police Constable Simple... ...who couldn't even direct traffic without causing a multiple pileup, now private detective Diamond, what have you got to say for yourself? I didn't shoot him. Oh, I know that. That much I guessed. You never were much of a shot, were you, P.C. Simple? After all, when we sent you for weapons training, you managed to shoot the instructor. Now, what I want to know is if you didn't go there to kill Naples, what did you go there for? He was my client. Oh, he needed a private eye? What for? That's private. Do you know who you're talking to, sonny? We were introduced. That's the chief inspector. Then why doesn't he go and inspect some chiefs and leave us alone? That'll do. All right, Boyle. But, sir-- He's underage. Is he always like that, or has it been a full moon? Not now, Boyle. I won't hurt him, sir. That's what you always say. Well, I just wanted to show him a little bit of respect, that's all. Just relax, Boyle. You want to watch yourself, sonny boy. Boyle here is really into police brutality. You don't want to upset him now, do you? All right. We'll tell you everything we know. Will we? Sure, once he's told us what he knows. How do I know you know anything? How do you know we don't? C.I. Snape: This is Henry von Falkenberg, also known as the Falcon. He was an international crook, a money-man, the finance behind just about every major crime in the Western world. You said, "Was"? Next slide, Boyle. This is the bus that ran him over. It happened in Bolivia. He was going to the airport on his way back to London. Bolivia! Johnny Naples. Naples was a Bolivian hood, strictly small-time, of course, but he had dealings with the Falcon, and he was there when the accident occurred. That was his lucky break. He heard the Falcon's last words. What were they? If we knew that, we wouldn't be talking to you, would we? Next slide, Boyle. Nick: The Fat Man. C.I. Snape: You know him? We've met. The whisper is that the Falcon was going to lend the Fat Man a great deal of money. We believe he was carrying it with him when he was knocked down. And Naples took it? Not the money, but the key to the money. You mean, like a checkbook? [ laughs ] Ah, the Falcon didn't trust banks. He had his own stash hidden somewhere in London in a strongbox or some sort of a vault. We don't know where it is, but we do know what's meant to be inside it. 3/4 of a million pounds in uncut diamonds. So the Falcon must have told Johnny Naples where they were. the Falcon must have blurted something out, enough to make Naples get on the first flight to England. And he wasn't alone. C.I. Snape: This is William Gott and Eric Himmell. They were the Falcon's right-hand men. Educated at Eton, expelled for suspected manslaughter, Gott and Himmell are masters of disguise. They're here now, and they're deadly. Boyle. This is Brenda von Falkenberg. She was a famous actress before she married the Falcon. Cute. About as cute as a tarantula. If she's after the diamonds, you'd better watch your back. Okay, so now you know. So now you tell us what you know. You were right first time, Chief Inspector. We don't know anything. You expect me to believe that? Why not? It's the truth. I'll get the truth, sir. Just five minutes with him alone. No, Boyle. I won't break anything. Well... not so that it shows. - No. - No? He's more use to me in one piece. Don't suppose you've got anything to add. I'm with him. Yes. Okay, you two, you can go. You're free. Free? Yeah, just like Johnny Naples was. There's a lot of very nasty people waiting to talk to you out there. It'll be interesting to see just which one of them gets to you first. [ both laugh ] [ sighs ] Hey, look, Nick, this case is getting dangerous, and I reckon, well, maybe it's time you backed off. - What?! - Well, sooner or later, someone's going to get hurt. You mean like Johnny Naples? Right, and you don't get more hurt than that. What are you saying, Herbert? Tim! It's Tim Diamond. - [ sawing ] - Nick: Okay, what's Tim Diamond going to do next? Next? Just out of interest. Oh, ta, love. Well... what would you do? Just out of interest. I'd find out where Johnny Naples went before he got killed. Why? Maybe he talked to someone who knows what the Maltesers mean. Yeah. Where would you start? Right here. The Casablanca Club? I found them in his hotel room. Members only. Oh, you don't want to join one of those places, Mr. Diamond. Dens of iniquity, that's what they are. It's part of my investigation. Oh. Oh, it is exciting. I've never cleaned for a private detective before. I once cleaned for a criminal, but it wasn't the same. He stole all my dusters, for a start. Betty. All right, Mr. D, I'll go and see to the bedrooms, leave you in peace. Nick: I wonder if Johnny Naples was a member. Tim: He's dead. Yeah, we know that, but they won't. Nick: It's this way. [ overlapping chatter ] This'll never work, you know. Man: What you looking for, boys? Hi there, young man. [ laughs ] [ glass shatters ] [ buzzer sounds ] Good evening, Mr. Naples. And who are you? I'm a chauffeur. Mr. Naples ain't got no car. I know that, but don't tell him, or I'll be out of a job. Nick: Getting in was no problem, but what would have brought Johnny Naples to a dive like this? Of all the bars in all the world, why had he walked into this one? Good evening, Johnny. Buenas noches. Show Mr. Naples to his usual chair. Yes, sir. Man: Thank you. - [ applause ] - Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much indeed. Champagne, sir? It's on the house. ...Casablanca Club's own Lauren Bacardi.

[ piano playing ] So the little runt went and got himself killed. Lauren: I knew it was too good to be true. When things start going right for me, that's when I look over my shoulder. How did you know him? You some sort of private eye? Yeah. How did you know? I can smell it. We were pen pals, sort of fell in love in the post. 10 years, we wrote to each other. Finally agreed to marry him. Did he have a package, a box? [ chuckles ] Maltesers? Sure. He never went anywhere without his precious Maltesers. Was some sort of secret about 'em, something he'd heard. Trouble was he hadn't heard enough. Said there was a fortune tied up in those damn Maltesers, but he couldn't work out how. I thought he was making the whole thing up. You believe him now? He's dead, isn't he? Must have been on the level for someone to want to wipe him out. Just my luck, the day after he finally figures it out. He found the diamonds? Diamonds? No, he didn't find any diamonds, but he did find the answer. I know, because I was with him at the time. Where were you, exactly? Ms. Bacardi. Yes? Special delivery for you, Ms. Bacardi. For me? I'm afraid I will have to ask for you to sign for them. Sure. But I've left my delivery book at the door. I'll talk to you in a moment. Since when did you have to sign for a bunch of flowers? I don't know. Nobody ever sent me flowers. [ chuckles ] Typical German bureaucracy. German! Oh! Sorry. Lauren: Help! Let me go! - [ muffled yelling ] - [ banging ] Hey! Stop! Nick! [ muffled ] Let me out, you... [ muffled grunting ] That brat is on the back. [ yells ] [ groans ] Nick? [ groans ] Nice day for a funeral, eh? Very funny. Where's Betty? She couldn't come. A death in the family. And I wasn't joking about that funeral. Here. Read this. You read it to me. They're burying the Falcon. "Henry von Falkenberg. Born in Camden, died in Bolivia, was flown home today to be buried back in his roots." The Camden Cemetery. Yeah, that's only two minutes away from here. That's quite a coincidence. You think so? - [ organ playing ] - [ bell tolling ] Man: What can I say about Henry von Falkenberg? He was not a good man, but does the Bible not say that, "He who is without sin amongst you, cast the first stone"? Now that he is about to find his final resting place, perhaps we can find it in our hearts to forgive. Nick: We weren't the only ones who'd come to see the Falcon buried. That had to be Brenda von Falkenberg, the black widow. Pastor: We can, as Christians... But who was the old guy propping up the gravestone? A friend of the Falcon's? Then there was the Fat Man and his chauffer. They were up to something, but what? Aye, the Simple brothers. Still playing at private detectives? Just following a lead, Chief Inspector. The only lead that you could follow is the sort that comes with a collar. You recognize 'em? Nick: Yeah, except the guy with the terminal cough. He's the Professor. Did he know the Falcon? He was the Falcon's technical advisor, his pet scientist. They say he invented computer fraud three years before they invented the computer. Brilliant, but harmless. C.I. Snape: I thought the booze had got him years ago. So what's he doing here? I was about to ask you the same. Let me ask him. Not here, Boyle. Well, we'll catch up with you later. Boyle. What more can we say about Henry? Indeed, he was not a good man. He was not a kind man... ...but now that he is a dead man, let us hope that he has finally atoned for his sins. Are you Tim Diamond? Yeah. I must speak to you. But not here. Come to my house tomorrow at 1:00. Hmm. Classy. You really think so? You're too young to know. Nick, look. In a hurry? Hello, Mr. Fat Man. Do you like funerals? I was thinking of arranging one, yours. I'm too young to die. I wouldn't bet on it. I gave you 48 hours to find me something. 48 hours have passed, but I have it not. Well, we're working on it, Mr. Fat Man, honestly. Your time has run out. [ gunshot ] Come on. Who is it? It's Lawrence, the Fat Man's chauffer. He must have got through the bathroom... - Nick. - ...window. Oh, no. Just hold it right there. You're under arrest. [ siren blaring ] Maybe I'm not cut out to be a private detective after all. What makes you think that? Well, I'm wanted for two murders, the Fat Man wants to kill me, my client is dead, my office has been torn apart, and I haven't actually been able to detect anything. I'll tell Snape everything. He can have the rotten Maltesers. You'll what? We got to give 'em to him, Nick. 3/4 of a million pounds worth of diamonds, and you want to give them away? I might get sent to prison. You're already in prison. They had nothing on me, so they let me go, but they kept Herbert for further questioning. That suited me. I had some questions of my own, starting with Brenda von Falkenberg. Whoever said crime doesn't pay should have seen the Falcon's place. [ carriage rattling ] Thanks. Yes? Remember me? Come in. What happened to your brother? He got held up. How did you know he was my brother? The same eyes. Come through. I want the Maltesers. Well, what makes you so sure I've got them? Fido. Fido. Nick: Fido? Nice swimming pool. [ yelps ] That's Fido? Don't worry. He's very fond of strangers. Yeah, cooked or raw? - [ gasps ] - The Maltesers. They belonged to my husband. The dwarf stole them. I want them. I've never been threatened with an alligator before. He's my pet. Have you ever thought about pussycats? - The Maltesers. - I don't have them. I don't. Tim has them. And where is he? He's helping the police with their inquiries. [ tray clatters ] [ laughs ] I like you, Nicholas. You're not afraid. How could a box of chocolates be worth 3/4 of a million pounds? Brenda von Falkenberg, the Fat Man, and Johnny Naples all seemed to know the answer, and I had it right in my hands, and I still couldn't work it out. Yeah? [ coughs ] [ panting ] It's good to sit down, so it is. It's a long way up. How many floors is it? One. Only one? But it's a lot of steps. You wouldn't have a little drop of something, would you? A restorative? No problem. I have my own. So you're the Professor. I came to see Tim Diamond. He's not here. So I see. I don't see much, but I can see that. I'll come straight to the point, sir, 50-50, half for you and half for me. - The cigarette? - [ coughs ] [ chortles ] That's quite a sense of humor you've got there, sir, quite a sense of humor. But you see, I know you've got it. Indeed, I do. A little box, would it be, a little red box? Yes. I designed it, you see, and I know what it's for. And what would that be, Professor? [ laughs ] Oh, no, no. No, no, that would be too easy. You're very bright, sir, very tricksy. I congratulate you, really, I do. So what do you have in mind? You give them to me and wait here, wait one hour, and I'll come back with the money. Half for you, half for me. On my word. All right. Thank you, sir. Thank you. You won't regret it. Just one hour. In one hour, the Professor would probably be on a flight out of the country, but he wouldn't get far, not with the box I'd given him. Nick: Where am I? What do you want with me? We just thought we would invite you to tea. Sit down. I do hope you like fairy cakes. I made them. You're too kind. [ speaking German ] Salmon and cucumber, and these little ones here are prawn and cream cheese. Danke. Bitte. Bitte. Yeah, it certainly is. Who plays the piano? It's Eric's, very fine instrument. 19th century. Perhaps you would like to hear something? Sure. How about, "Good-bye, it was nice meeting you"? I don't think so. Eric. [ playing piano ] Now if you're comfortable, I'm afraid we have a number of questions we must put to you. Yeah, I was rather afraid of that. It will be quite painless, I assure you. Unless of course you decide not to sing. Hold on. I haven't even picked up the tune. You have the Maltesers? Not exactly. Ah. Did you search the flat? Gott: Of course. Well, everyone else has. Willie and I broke into your office during the funeral. We were surprised there by a gentleman in a chauffeur's costume. That was Lawrence. We would have been quite happy to have come to some sort of arrangement, but he was very uncooperative. In fact, he said some very hurtful things, so we shot him. Nice fairy cake. So where are they? Uh... well, we put them in Saint Pancras Station, the left luggage lockers, but the trouble is Tim's got the key. Do you know the number? What if I don't? Then we have no further use for you. It's 180. 180? Einhunderhtachtzig. Yeah, "Einhunderhtachtzig." Thank you. Well, if that's all you wanted to know... I'm afraid not. - Eric, the cord. - [ plays chord ] Nein! Die seil! Ah. All I can say is if this is what they taught you at Eton, I'm glad I went to a comprehensive school. So you're the kid who came round to the Casablanca Club. Yeah, Nick Diamond. Well, thanks a lot, Nick. I was enjoying my life until you came along. Hey, wait a minute. It wasn't me who led 'em to you. Oh, yeah? Then who was it? That's a good question, and I've got another one. What is it? Those two clowns aren't going to find anything at Saint Pancras Station, so what are they going to do to me when they get back? P.A.: Local service to Bedford. [ P.A. announcements continue ] ...platform number three. Platform number three, local service to Bedford. You're going to hurt yourself. That's all right. It'll save them the trouble. Secret is to relax. - Relax? - Yeah. And muscle contraction. Like this. How did you do that? Easy. Before I became a singer, I worked as an assistant to an escapologist... ...Harry Blondini. - You ever see him? - No. Only guy I ever knew who took his showers hanging upside down. He taught me some of his tricks. It's easy when you know how. So why didn't you escape before? Wasn't any point. Door's locked and bolted from outside. We're five stories up. Anyway... I'd never get through those bars. [ P.A. announcements continue ] [ speaking German ] Oh, look at that, Uncle. Hey, get out of the way. Look at this. Look at this. It'll never work. Why don't you just get a move on and do it, honey? I got it! Then do it. [ shrieks ] Oh, no! [ yelling ] Look out! Uhh! Right. [ yells ] What took you so long? [ horn honking ] Oh, God! Oh! Let's get out of here. [ honking continues ] Too late. The piano. The what? Don't you think you're going just a little too far? Just as far as the window. [ piano strings twang ] You know, I never thought I'd have my life saved for me by a 13-year-old. Here's to you, kid.

The last minute, he walked out on me, ran away with a snake charmer. What did she have that I didn't? I turned to singing after that. 20 years of the same old songs, and do you know, in all that time, I've only met two decent people? Johnny Naples... and you.

You told them you'd been here? - I had to. - Come on. - This way! - This way. - No, this way. - Meet you at the bus stop. Hey, you take Bacardi. I'll get the boy. Excuse me. Sorry. Do you mind? Out of my way. Out of my way, you-- What do you think you're doing? Oh! Woman: Wasn't it Moose Malloy who killed Marriott? Second woman: No, it was Velma Valento who killed him. Oh, but how did Marriott know-- - You brat! - [ bullet zings ] [ both gasping ] Out of my way, you-- [ man mutters ] Woman: Hooligan. Gott: Hold it. Just spoiling it for everybody else. - [ gasps ] - [ girl screams ] Man: Little bump here. Excuse me. What? Stop it. Girl: Granddad! Granddad! [ gasping ] [ children scream ] [ groans ] Ho ho ho. And what have we here? - [ silenced gunshot ] - Oh! [ air hissing ] What of this one? You want it or the panda? Effective at over 30 feet, the safety catch is here. The price on this is £159.99, sir. [ glass shatters ] [ bullet pings ] [ bears squeaking ] - Does the job. - [ squeaking continues ] Oh, no. No, you don't. Not this time, sonny boy. Lauren: Hold tight. I thought we'd never make it. Fares, please. 1 1/2 to Belsize Park. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Belsize Park? - Fares, please. - Herbert. - Yes, madam. Thank you. I don't believe it. You mean he tried to kill Uncle Holly? He was trying to kill me. Yeah, but you're not fat and loveable. Thanks, Herbert. You haven't told them anything? I haven't seen them. They're letting me sweat it out. You don't know what it's like in here, Nick, the solitude, terrible, endless solitude. It's only been two days, Herbert. It's all right for you. You're out there enjoying yourself while I'm the one who's stuck behind bars. Sure. - Wait a minute. - What? What did you just say? I just said, "What?" - No, before that. - When? You said it. You're brilliant. Sure, I am. But why? What did I say? "Behind bars." Bars? Bar codes. Bar codes. Bar codes are digital information. Information about what? About the product, who makes it, how much it costs, all that sort of thing. So that's what Johnny saw in Selfridges? It has to be. How does it work? Come. I'll show you. Thank you very much. There you are. It's all done by lasers, you see. This is called a light emitting diode. See this shining light here? It bounces off the white lines on the product, creating a series of signals rather like Morse code, black, white, black, white, black, white. Can we run our Maltesers through this? If you want to. You left them out the back. I'll get them. It's not new technology, but I had to save for many years to get it. And it'll be able to read my bar code? No problem. Here you are. I shall show you. The pen. The bar code. [ beeping ] Oh! Come along! There's nothing to be seen! Get out! Get out! Lock the door! You all right, Uncle? What happened? You sure you won't come up? - No. - [ siren passing ] I want to get home while it's still light. See you, kid. Sure. Look, what I said last night, I want you to know I meant it. You're a nice kid. You deserve the best. Hey, wait a minute. You're talking like we're never going to see each other again. I am? Sure. Forget it. I just stood there and let her walk away from me. That was my first mistake. Then I went up to the office. That was my second. Are you Nick Diamond? No, I'm not Nick Diamond! I don't even look like him. - I'm... - Yeah? I'm the delivery boy. What are you delivering? I'm delivering singing telegrams. That's it. I'm a singing telegram. Ahem! ♪ We wish you a merry Christmas ♪ ♪ We wish you a merry Christmas ♪ ♪ We wish...

Hello, Fat Man. Get him ready. In. No, thanks. I've already had a bath today. Just do it, kid. It's wet! Don't worry, kid. It's quick-drying. [ laughs ] You're crazy, Fat Man. And you, my friend, are a fool. I gave you 48 hours to find me something, and find it, you did not. I already have the answer, the key to 3/4 of a million pounds. Okay, so you've got the key, but you still don't know what it opens. True, but I shall know soon. [ boat horns honking ] Professor. You played a trick on me, sir, a trick. You gave me the wrong box. And so the Professor came to me, a wise decision, very wise. It was the Professor who invented the bar code. You see, the Falcon needed a key, and this was the perfect answer. And soon the Professor will show me what it opens, and then-- And then he'll be joining me at the bottom of the Thames. No, sir, no. It's half each. I have the word of a gentleman. Throw him in. Some gentleman. This is the police! Drop that bath, and stay where you are! We have the place surrounded! - [ gunfire ] - Watch it! This way, Professor! Come on, let's go. This way! [ yells ] Help me! I can't swim! Put down your weapons, - and-- - [ bullet pings ] [ groans ] Sir, the car. [ police radio chatter ] Hey, wait a minute! [ clears throat ] We came here to rescue him, Boyle. Go and see if you can find a chisel. We were watching your flat, lucky for you. Why? We wanted to see who would turn up, and then when that lot led you out, we followed you, and the rest you know. No, I want the Maltesers. So he told you. Your big brother sang like a canary. Well, Herbert and canaries have a lot in common. Where are they? The Fat Man took them. I'm not lying, Snape. Arrest the Fat Man, and you'll get the Maltesers. We're too late. The Fat Man's probably halfway to South America by now. Hey, look, Inspector, I'm finished for tonight. I just want a hot bath and bed, okay? All right, son, but I've still got a few questions I want to ask you. Sure. Try and get some sleep. Yeah. Good night. Sleep tight. Don't let Boyle bite. Hey, when are you going to let Herbert out? It's all-- it's all right, son. I've radioed from the car. He'll be on his way over now. As I washed the concrete from between my toes, I thought back to how the whole thing had begun. You must not open it. You just keep it safe for two or three days. Then I come back for it. But the dwarf had never made it back. The Falcon. The sun. Where'd Naples been going the day he came to see us? He bought an envelope and a pair of scissors. Nick: Camden Cemetery. And it's only two minutes away from here. Quite a coincidence. He needed the scissors to cut out the bar code, but why the cemetery? Patel: You see this shining light here? This bounces off the white lines on the product. [ telephone ringing ] Yes? [ muffled grunts ] We have your brother. So what, Gott? I want the Maltesers. And what if I don't play along? We send you your brother one piece at a time. [ muffled grunts ] Okay, I'll save you the postage. Be at the cemetery at 10:30 tomorrow morning. I'll bring the Maltesers. You bring Tim. No tricks, Diamond. Just be there. I'd managed to work it all out in the bath, but how could I get the Maltesers back? Then I remembered. Hello. Hello! Hello. I need to get a message to the Fat Man. And who should I say is speaking? Tell him it's Nick Diamond. Tell him I know what the key opens and I'm willing to do a deal. Deal? What sort of deal? I'll be at the Falcon's grave tomorrow morning at 10:30. Tell him to bring the Maltesers, but no tricks. I just want the Fat Man, nobody else. I do hope that you're not wasting my time, my boy. You must know by now that I don't take kindly-- Where are the Maltesers, Fat Man? Now, where's the deal? I thought the deal was going to be with us. You okay, Herbert? It's Tim, Tim Diamond. Why don't you ever get it right? I'm sorry. All right, what is this? If this little [ speaking German] is trying to trick us... Relax. I promised you the Maltesers in exchange for Tim. There they are. And I promised you I'd tell you their secret. If you'll let me, I will. Go ahead. But it had better be good. Oh, it's very good, but then the Professor was very smart. He built the Falcon the ultimate safety-deposit box. The key was on a box of Maltesers. Excuse me. Thank you. Nobody would ever look for it. Nobody would ever know. So much for the key, but what about the lock that it opened? You're looking at it. "The shining light" refers to a light beam of some sort. That ought to be a laser. You run your bar code through here... [ whirring ] ...and provided you've got the right bar code... My God. There you have it, the Falcon's diamonds. the Fat Man: My diamonds. - Gott: Our diamonds. - Himmell: Our diamonds. Now this is the interesting bit, who gets to shoot who. I just want to shoot you. Nick: And let the Fat Man get a shot at you? I'll take care of the Fat Man. Not before I take care of you. But why does anyone have to take care of anyone? [ guns firing ] [ gasps ] Nobody's hit you, Tim. Haven't they? Oh, my God. What... Nick... Hello, Mr. Nicholas. Whatcha, Mr. Timothy? Blimey, what a turnup, isn't it? Betty Charlady? Yes, Betty Charlady, but that's not her real name. You guessed? Well, there wasn't anyone else left. I know who she is. She's-- she's... She's Brenda von Falkenberg. May I? Be my guest. Gott and Himmell had to be working for somebody. How did they know we were going to the Casablanca Club that night? Somebody had to tell them. Betty did. But how did you know that Betty was Brenda or Brenda was Betty? When I went to see Brenda, she knew my name without my telling her. She also knew we were brothers. That meant she knew us, so I put two and two together, and it made one person. You're very clever, Nicholas. Maybe, but there's still one thing I don't get. Why did you kill Johnny Naples in the first place? It was an accident. I'd always meant to double-cross Eric and William. Of course I had. They found the dwarf for me. Then, without telling them, I went to see him, slipped in the back way, up the fire escape. - What happened? - We argued, and he pulled a gun on me. There was a fight. Somehow, the gun went off. I'm completely lost. Don't worry. I'll explain it all again later. Later? [ laughs ] I'm sorry, boys, really I am, but there can't be any witnesses. You must see that. Nobody leaves this cemetery alive. When did they ever? Cheerio, Mr. Nicholas. Ta-ta, Mr. Timothy. - Oh, no. - I don't think so, Betty. [ grass rustling ] That's a lucky coincidence. What do you mean, a coincidence? I called them last night. Tim: You called them? I wasn't going to walk into this alone. Thank you. - [ yells ] - Boyle! [ overlapping chatter ] - Got the wagon? - Here. You okay, lad? Sure. Good. Come on, then. Let's have a look at these diamonds. [ band playing "God Rest You Merry, Gentlemen" ] It was Lauren Bacardi, of course. She'd taken them. I'd known it in the cemetery the moment I'd seen the empty tray. Nick Diamond. Back in the supermarket... - Sign here. - ...we'd left the Maltesers sitting right next to a photocopier, and she went out to Mr. Patel's office, she copied the bar code. It would work just like the original. [ band continues ] After everything I'd done for her, she'd run out and left me with nothing. Another postcard from Mum, more bills, and a package. It's for you from the south of France. How do you know? The postmark. That's brilliant, Herbert. Well, I am a detective. [ band playing "We Wish You a Merry Christmas" ] "No hard feelings?" Question mark? Who's L.B.? What is it? What does it look like? So she finally got her place in the sun. It's a... Yeah, it's a diamond. So we're rich. [ ornaments clatter ] Yeah, we're rich-ish. Let's go out tonight. Let's celebrate. Dinner and a movie. What movie? They're showing "Farewell, My Lovely" down at the Roxy. But we've already seen it. I know, but there's one bit I didn't quite understand. What bit was that? Well, it's when Marlowe goes to see Jessie Florian. Yeah. Why doesn't she tell him about Mrs. Grayle? Because she doesn't know about Mrs. Grayle. Then why did Velma have to kill her? But Velma didn't kill her. That was Moose Malloy. You mean Moose Malloy killed Velma? No, I mean Moose Malloy killed Mrs. Grayle. Then who was Black Jack? Blackjack was the weapon she used. [ theme music playing ] ♪ Just ask for Diamond ♪ Just ask for Diamond.
