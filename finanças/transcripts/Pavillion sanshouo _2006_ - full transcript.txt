Next week at 1pm on Sunday November 20th... at the Tokyo, Koganei city Salamandre Kinjiro Foundation... the 150th birthday party for national animal treasure... great salamander Kinjiro will be held. 15th generation shogun Yoshinobu had the legendary salamander Kinjiro... displayed at the Paris World's Fair in 1867. Later, Kinjiro was put on display by the Meiji government... at the 1889 World's Fair when the Eiffel Tower was built. And at the 1900 World's Fair where... recent inventions like cinema and x-rays were unveiled. The X-ray discovered by Wilhelm Rontgen debuted at the 1900 Paris World's Fair... wowing all scientists who came in contact with this astonishing invention. Meanwhile... in a small pond nearby inquisitive eyes were fixed on a sad fur seal. But he's no fur seal, he's a lizard. Wait, not a lizard, but a newt. No, if the truth must be known no one understood what he was. If only Dr. Rontgen had visited his pond... 21st century genius X-ray technician Tobishima Houichi... wouldn't have been chased by this suspicious Mercedes. "I am a salamander." yelled Kinjiro. Then he cried. I ain't tailing you. I've got a job for you. Dr. Tobishima Houichi, right? Kagawa Morihiro, Farm Fidelity Chairman Heard x-ray techs are tight-lipped. But how tight-lipped are you? I'm joking, Doc. Fun jokes come with the job. You busted into the Kanto Bank exam line this morning, right? OK next. Was that a "fun" joke too? Rest your chin there. More. Higher. OK. Inhale, inhale. Hold it... Whammy! He's no joke... Dr. Houichi. SALAMANDRE KINJIRO FOUNDATION Hey sis... My mommy... where is she? Azuki, are you lonely without a mommy? I'm not lonely. But, my school athletic meet is coming up. I'll go watch you. You don't want your sis to? No, I want you to sis. You know I was studying ballet in France before you were born, right? I met your mommy there. We were... How old were you? We were both 18. Really? Almost the same age as me. Yes. Azuki... It's been too long. Mihari's in the office and sent me for you. Okay then. It's not a bad offer. Mihari... much of your father's debt still remains, right? So... Daddy's loans aren't your concern. Why isn't Mr. Kagawa here? Something came up. He'll attend Kinjiro's birthday party. Akino, I won't oppose your marriage to him sis. Do as you please. But we won't treat him like family. I've never considered selling the foundation to him. We'll take care of daddy's debt. So stop meddling. I'll be back. Is Azuki home? Who knows. School I guess. Daddy, complain about Kinjiro to Mihari. Mihari and Hibiko ran me out, remember? They haven't seen or talked to me now for three years. Then ask sister Akino? Akino's... busy with her movies and such. Make peace with them, will ya? 'Course I'd like to. But time's of the essence. Bad guys are after Kinjiro. - Huh? - That's right. That's why we gotta move him to a safe place quick smart. Please. Get Kinjiro out of the house. OK? Will ya? You got it? He's in your hands. Please, OK? I don't know why, but no way! Why not? C'mon why? Hey Azuki... Azuki! Damn! Azuki! Come here. Your mother loved Kinjiro. Huh? Mother. My mother? You bet. So save Kinjiro and we'll go see your mother. Okay? What'd you say? Azuki... That's no good! No way! C'mon, you're not watching. A week ain't enough time. It is. Stop joking. Took me three months. Take you ten years to be a pro. At least ten years. Same for x-rays, right? Salamandre Kinjiro Foundation controls the national animal treasure Kinjiro... receiving massive funding from the government for decades. The public's taxes have poured billions into this freaky animal. However, suspicion has risen that this national treasure is a fake. How about it, Doc? Heard you're a man of justice. I'm an x-ray tech. OK! Let's get down to business. Kinjiro fractured his spine at the Paris World's Fair during the 19th century. In other words, if he's genuine, he'll have scars. But if he's a fake, he won't. So? Does this job call for radiologists or what? Then what will you do? Payment is upon the results. Consider this... a gift from me. Your sister's wedding is costly, right? You've got a week. How'd he know about my wedding? Kinjiro is genuine. Kinjiro is fake. Houichi didn't know either. If only the great Dr. Rontgen had visited Kinjiro's pond... 21st century genius X-ray technician Tobishima Houichi... wouldn't have accepted this queer request to pay for his sis's wedding. Salamandre Kinjiro Foundation and the Farm Fidelity. Tobishima Houichi knew neither their plans nor feuds. But as Ninomiya Azuki who he'll meet in this vortex will say... "Genuine or fake? It's no skin off my nose." As for their sweet rendezvous... he didn't see that coming either. I'm most honored to be invited to Kinjiro's 150th birthday celebration. Here's his gift. Shall we get down to our important business? We're finished talking. Have a drink outside, forget everything and go home. You haven't changed, Mihari. When I worked for your dad, you were in Kindergarten. - Remember? - I don't. What projects are you up to presently? Your dad used this... Come on, Mihari and Hibiko. You remember, your "brother" Kagawa? Forgot the toys he brought? H-huh? W-when we were in k-k-kindergarten... weren't you s-studying in F-fran-ce... sister A-A-Akino? D-don't you remember? Sorry. It's my fault. I'll talk to my sisters and we'll meet again, okay? They simply forgot about me. They'll remember soon enough. Drive. Call Hibari. Sister A-A-kino... be-be-betrayed us after all. The guards were drinking. Outta hold a "Steal Kinjiro" sign. You're drinking. We're on duty. CONGRATULATIONS KINJIRO - 150 YEARS You in the glasses, move your chin. And you sir, over to the right. Hey sis... I've decided to go see my mother. - We all ready? Here goes. - See her? But... But? - Well, why so sudden? - Look this way. I'm lonely. Here we go. Good. Alert! Alert! Alert! Kinjiro's gone! Quiet. You're from the party? What? Hey, hey, hey. Didn't think I had help. Tobishima Houichi. That's Kinjiro, eh? Yep. I just put him to sleep. Cute, huh? If he wasn't slimy, sure. Hurry and drive. But we gotta take x-rays. What? Hurry or they'll catch you. What do we do? Take him? Didn't daddy tell you? Daddy? You're the daughter of that yakuza? Yakuza? Yeah, hired me to take x-rays. - Who did? - Your daddy, right? - Open up! - See, they're here. Hurry and drive. Hold your horses... Who are you? Drive... the... car! Get a move on! Hey! Wait! Hold up! Stop! Hey, he's backing up! He's turning! Azuki told me. About her mother... what're you planning? We can't keep hiding the truth, right? Someday we... Why do you get to decide that "someday"? Don't be selfish. I'll decide things for her. Akino. - Hey Akino. - I can hear! I'll tell you the truth. I wanna live with you and Azuki. Properly as a family this time. To atone for the past. Don't talk silly. I'm serious. If you let me, you can drop the sister act. Ever thought how hard it was for me? Saying she wants to see her mom so much. And I... her... Maybe so. I was wrong. Let's start over and get married for real. I'm marrying Kagawa. I'll take custody of Azuki as her mother. By God you will! Why not? She's my child. Why can't we live with Kagawa? Kagawa is dangerous. I won't hand Azuki over if you marry him. Can you inhale? Inhale. Inhale, inhale. Hold it. Oh... sorry. Azuki. What were you thinking? Hand over Kinjiro. I promised daddy. If I deliver Kinjiro, he'll bring me my mother. Your father is using you. He's not even here, right? Get in. "Not here"? You mean you didn't let him come? What's with that tone? I don't have one photo of her. I gave up. But when I heard I could meet her, I got excited. So don't interfere. That woman left you. She neglected you for 17 years. I still wanna know. Why she had to leave me or... how she felt 17 years ago? I won't know unless I see her, right? Kai. Call the Farm Fidelity guy about the job. Sure. Tell him I failed and I'll give back his money. Sorry I couldn't help with the wedding. No worries. How cute. How great, Kinjiro. We can take him anywhere. Now we wait for your dad to call. Yeah. Kinjiro who just celebrated his 150th birthday is ill so... unfortunately, we can't show him to you at home. Salamandre means salamander in French. I'll ask Ninomiya Mihari... the chairman and vice-chairman Ninomiya Hibiko about its origin. Why the French name? S-s-salamander... K-K-Kinjiro is... Yes? Go on. Kinjiro who we care after... has been a goodwill ambassador three times since the 1867 Paris World Fair. - Kameda. - Yes? We're a laughing stock thanks to you. People know he's been kidnapped. But you know, it could improve the foundation's image. Don't be silly! The Farm Fidelity is behind this. Kagawa plotted his revenge! Stop being surprised and do something. Have you even investigated that x-ray truck? I'm busy looking into medical companies right now. Get busier! Hurry up!! Yes. Take down those decorations. But your daughter made them? As you wish. S-s-somebody get me a car. Where to? O-out. To Rop-p-pongi. If it's a man, invite him here. You're too careless lately. I don't want to be here any longer. W-what's wrong? Y-you okay? I can't take it anymore. I wanna go home to Iwaki. Are you from Iwaki? I wanna go home to Ehime. Ehime? W-what's wrong? Here, it's OK. - What happened? - Take a ferry... A ferry. - You? You want to take a ferry? - To Ehime. He... that man... he... Just a moment. Jason! Relax. You're so kind. J-Jason? J-J-Jason! Well if it ain't Ninomiya Hibiko, age 25, Scorpio, B blood type... Salamandre Kinjiro Foundation vice-chairman, Level 4 English proficiency. What's a stutterer studying English for? Get real missy. Answer the question. Answer please. P-pardon? I ain't smart ya know. Don't speak English. OK? H-help me. Pardon? I wanna know. Why she had to leave me or... won't know unless I see her, right? A popular actress shouldn't be here, now should she? What now? Hibiko was attacked by Farm Fidelity hoods. Kinjiro. You wanna see mommy too? Hope we see her soon. Open up you thief! Open up! I'll burn this car! Miss Azuki... why? Miss Azuki, please open the door. You're hiding Kinjiro, right? We'll make up an excuse later. Miss Azuki open... Was it you? Answer me. Did you do it? Don't worry. She's fine. I called to check on Hibiko's health. My staff are too short-tempered. I told them to stop, you know. I'm practicing for the Concours De Concours. I'm busy. I'm sorry. Marrying you scares me. I figured you were doing bad things but... So please... don't be rough with my sisters. Good-bye. Wait up! Your sisters? Get real. Those chicks ain't your sisters and you know it. Huh? Don't "huh" me? Planning on keeping it secret? I know everything about you. You and their father Shiro. Secrets about you and that filthy salamander. What... are you after? How's your daughter? Heard she's searching for her mommy these days. You and Shiro are cruel. The poor kid. She's with the x-ray tech, right? Sister? I've got something to tell you. Meet me tomorrow. Huh? Sounds strange. I'll tell you about your mother and introduce you. Huh? Tomorrow afternoon... Shi... Shizuoka prefecture, Fuego village... Gobansho Ridge, Mt. Nishido tunnel. What? I can't hear you. Gobansho Ridge. Go-ban... This is the voice message service. What! Connect me! Shizuoka Prefecture, Fuego village? Maybe... your mom's living here? Give it up and open the door! My sister was crying. Come on. Sweet. Kinjiro, dinner time. Here ya go, fella. This white powder isn't mold. It's salt. Pretty cute once you get used to him. There ya go. Tuck in. Hey... - Yeah? - Why are you helping me? Well, 'cause if I don't, who will? How long does your dad plan on keeping him in this tiny tank? Daddy's fine. He always turns up in the nick of time. How cool. Maybe he'll turn up now. - Hope not. - Why? I mean I'm with a weird 30 year old x-ray tech. Daddy would blow his top. Sorry for being 30. And divorced too. No way? Who was she? No one in particular. An ordinary girl. Where'd you meet her? Why? I wanna know! Tell me. Here. Huh? Well, like I just said. I sat here and she was in there. "Inhale, inhale. Hold it... Whammy!" Like that. Like what? So you examined her? - Yep. - Whoa! Kinjiro, did you hear that? He's into taking x-rays of girls. What a pervert. I'm no pervert! It's my job. I'm a pro. I just thought. The job's not interesting. Can this really take x-rays? 'Course so. This van was built to take x-rays all day long. Take mine. - Take what? - Me. Wow. She's inside. No, don't face this way. Put your chest over there. But then I can't see it. Forget about that. I wanna see! - In... Inhale. - You okay? Inhale... - I can't. - Hold it, whammy! Double whammy! Hold your horses! How many are you taking? Triple whammy! That's enough. I'm a pro, a pro! No. 1 was dodgy. No. 2 is professional. I wasn't in there. No. 3 is professional. No way. It's fine. I'm a pro. Whammy! But I'm not over there! It's fine. Can I come out? OK 'cause I'm a pro. National health insurance? Full chest, No. 2 whammy OK. No. 4 whammy, a keeper. Ninomiya Azuki, 18, female. I said no bra. That camisole is fine but no bra. The wire shows up. - Retake. - Huh? Retake. What a pain. Hurry or I'll take it off. Fine. Take it off. Huh? Did you do the same with your ex-wife? I wanna know. I did this. And then? We kissed. So kiss. Kinjiro. Be patient, almost there. Should be around here. I thought so... Lend me your glasses. Ow! Sorry! - Don't sorry me! - Sorry. Sorry. - Here. - Apologies. - Oh, my bad. - Hey, shape up! It's my fault! Go easy on him. Is Mt. Fuji around here? This way? - Around here I guess. - That's wrong. No it isn't. Don't... We ate at this rest stop here, right? Then we ate at that industrial park, right? Did not! - Kameda hasn't a clue. - Where'd he say it was? Think your mom's really here? Huh? Kameda? Hey, Kameda! Kameda! He fell. You all right? What the hell. We'll worry. Can't he hear us? Oh, we're busted. Azuki. Been looking all over. What're you doing here? Let's go home. No, I've got business here. Do it later. Something's happened. Like what? Akino's dead. Huh? SUDDEN DEATH FOR ACTRESS NINOMIYA AKINO Mihari told us "authorized staff only". You calling me unauthorized? Ain't for you to decide. Let me by. No, Predecessor. Predecessor? That what they're calling me? Akino's dead and I can't even pay my respects. What's happening to this family? Mihari. Let me see Akino. Please. Offer your incense here. Mihari, do you have time? None. Azuki... it's about your mother. Forget it. It's important. What do you two care? Besides, we have different mothers. S-sister Akino. Huh? We figured out that Akino was actually daddy's lover. What the hell? D-didn't you know? How could I! When Keitaro and I got married, I saw our family register. You were listed as their daughter. And you believe that? Yes, I do. Really. Some strange family, huh? The bandit Salvatore Giuliano during post WW2 Sicily was a hero... saving the poor who were oppressed by the church and nobility. Extending a helping hand for the feeble and the downtrodden... Tobishima Houichi was a new man. Like Giuliano. Salve. It's been too long. It's mi, Houichi. I'm way legit you know. Don't pass me by. Left this in my ride. You're such a space cadet. Sorry 'bout your sis. I know how to cheer you up. We'll search for your mom. OK? Off to Fuego village. Hang on, I've got school. Fuego's got one! These ideals lit a fire in the revolutionary Giuliano... 'til one 1950 morning in his sleep under an olive tree, his life was scattered. Then in the winter of 2005 fueled by these ideals, the lordly Houichi... was the next fellow to make sad, Sicilian history. With his band of simple, gallant revolutionaries... he pledged to find the lovely Ninomiya Azuki's... still unseen yet kind mother. Houcha! Howdy-do! Howdy-do! Hey, let's go. - Howdy-do! - Howdy-do! - Still waiting? - Yah! Give it up. Nah! Villagers. Dat boy over der sleepin'. He don't getz up. Iffin' he don't seez a doc, he'za gonna go loony in der head. Yah, yah. Iffin' we don't call a doc, we can'ta help him. Sorry. Fregive uz. No, we'll tread softly. He's fought enough. Let that hero rest. It's Kameda. These villagers saved him. He's alive but... not living! I'za shootin' mountain goats! Boyz iz huntin'! Tomorrow's another day. Get some rest tonight. No thanks. You'll thank me! What Akino wanted to tell you was that your mother is living here. We'll do it for Akino, okay? Kameda. Got a school here, right? We'z goed to the temple school. She can't go there. Ain't got compulsory education? Qapla'. Batlh je! Qapla' batlh je! You have one new message. Message number 1. Azuki? It's Akino. Sorry we got cut off. You taking this down? Shizuoka prefecture, Fuego village... Join us Azuki. Kinjiro... whether you're genuine or fake it's no skin off my nose. Azuki! Azuki! Houcha! What'z wrong? Azuki's gone! Kinjiro too! Don't wig out, just find her! Yah! Azuki! Azuki! Howdy-do! Azukiii! You won't find her going in circles! It's heavy. It's okay, I can do it alone. Let's... sell the foundation to the Farm Fidelity. It's mortifying but we should all be living quietly together. Tending rice fields and chasing after goats and sheep or... catching eels and... D-don't cry. Don't cry. - H-huh? Azuki... - You have one new message. Message number 1. Azuki? It's Akino. Sorry we got cut off. You taking this down? Shizuoka prefecture, Fuego village Gobansho Ridge, Mt. Nishido tunnel. Tomorrow afternoon... Huh? What are you doing here? Hey! Why are you here? Sister... who did you last see? Hey, hey! Howdy ho, A-zu-cha! Eh? Azucha, what'z wrong? It'z Houichi! I'za talkin' to ya!

Wait! Wait! My truck's this way! Back here! Hey, Keitaro? What? Clever figuring out where I was. Mihari said you were visiting the grave. I see. Thanks for picking me up. Good! Who's there? There you go! Ninomiya Shiro, Azuki's father. Owch! I was thinking of living together as a family. But I had a fight with her mom about Azuki. She died soon after. We were like two ships in the night. This stuff's strong! Relax old man. Azuki's a fine woman. I can guarantee that. How can you? You do something to her? Yep. I took her x-ray. So... you can die happy. Didn't say I was dying. Sounded like your last will. I wanna raise Azuki. You really a radiologist? Why question that? Got a license. I'm a pro. Now, you're sounding fishy. Right, then! Take my x-ray. Why so reluctant? I choose my patients. So Azuki was just a patient? I didn't say that. So as a top x-ray tech... Azuki and I, we've gone beyond the x-ray tech-patient relationship. Maybe we'll have such a relationship? So take my x-ray. Here, here, here. Right here! Actually I'm thinking of quitting. No more x-rays? Too bad. It's a noble profession. I respect you. I'm honored. But I'm finished. I've decided. I want to finish that stodgy foundation. Didn't they run you out? Don't matter. They sold it. I can't take it. Help me. The enemy is fierce. Lend me a hand. For what? For Azuki. I'm a radiologist. You just quit, right? You telling me to give it up? You said you were quitting. Giving it up, right? Give it up. But Azuki will remain. I gave up the foundation for my family. So you give up radiology. Got mates? You bet. One plus two. From today we're mates too. Right? - Yeah. - Shake on it. Deal! - You bet. - Good! Let's start by giving up this truck? No objections! No objections! No objections! It's light. - Huh? What's this? - It doesn't fit. Not one bit. Who measured it? Not again. Wasn't me. I'll get it back someday. Thanks. Kinjiro is gone. - Kinjiro's not here. - Again? Kinjiro's gone. Find him now! Angry again? Mommy's angry. The "Reborn" Kameda Hitoshi? Private preschool and dental care. My wife's dance school and quilting club. All costs big bucks. Where's a dance school here in the sticks? You remember me? My comrade, right? Hey... Family is a wonderful thing. Whatever. Yeah, we're comrades. Got a job for you. Be ready in five. In ten. No deal. Five minutes. Hey! No, no! He almost got run over! Here. Here. Here. Take him. Hurry. Put him in the pond. Daddy? W-what... W-what the heck? REBORN KAMEDA GROCERY / OPEN 24H 24 hours? It's closed! Kameda! How long we gotta wait? It's morning! I've never not kept my word. I'll bring home souvenirs. Wait for me. Kameda. How do you throw this? "Huh? What are you doing here?" Just came to return this net. "Hey! Why are you here?" Kameda, this van's got no pick up, man. No objections! Hey wait, what's your business here? No objections! Whammy! Hey wait. - Watch out. - You okay? Stop! Intruders! Who the hell are you? Shut up ugly! Shut up ugly! Shut up ugly! Shut up ugly! Who you calling ugly, you ruffian! Shut up ugly! Shut up ugly! There wasn't a job for me at the foundation. Kagawa approached me last year about working together. And this pet food was the job. I wanna know about that day! Answer me. When I came up the stairs... Akino was there. I was shocked too. Kagawa said if I didn't help, he'd kill my daughter. Kagawa killed her? Kagawa! Where iz yah? I'll confess to the police. If you go to jail, who'll play with Michi? She's finally calling you daddy. Can you be so cruel? What should I do? Don't cry to me! Figure it out yourself. Nobody'z in der! It'z abandoned! Yah! Keepa lookin'! Yah! Punch me. With your fist. Can't do... My cavities. Kagawa won't get away with this. Get me the car. That's the spirit! 1, 2! 1, 2! Watch the cross. Don't rest. Now uppercut! Uppercut! Don't stop. No resting. Now cross! Rope a dope. Don't rest. Uppercut. Don't stop. Uppercut. Jab. Jab. What? Didn't recognize you Doc. What's up Doc? I gave up radiology. Don't ever call me Doc again! Either way, you'd better leave before I get pissed. The Pan Pacific Boxing Senior Championship is coming up. Let me train. OK! From today we get serious! 1, 2! 1, 2! 1, 2! Now rush in! Rush, rush! And clinch! Bust free and uppercut! Uppercut!

My liver. The ink... in my liver. The ink... my liver. In... Live... Way to go. I knew we could. Remember, the ink was my idea. Honestly, Tobishima Houichi... was a bit bewildered by this warm welcome. He'd given up everything raiding the evil fortress with his band of friends. But to attend his sister's wedding? "Just like Dazai's Melos," he thought. Suddenly amid the circle of applause... an unexpected happiness engulfed him. This being... Kai. Is this Kinjiro's baby? Are you marrying Kinjiro? So Kinjiro and I'll be brothers, eh? How do you feel? Where's the camera? Over there. Sorry. Over here. I know I couldn't have made it without everyone's help. Thanks to you all I think we were able to succeed today. Being an x-ray tech for ten years had meaning after all. You have blessed us! Making my sister's wedding in time I feel like Melos. With his sister bride... being treated like a pet by his partner... Kinjiro felt severely unpleasant. Was Kinjiro genuine or not? That very suspicion led Tobishima Houichi to meet Ninomiya Azuki. While the object before his eyes was clearly fake... it's form was ripe with unsuspicious malice. See Mount Fuji. Over there. See it? Far away. - A crow. - Huh? Look a crow. You're right. How cute. It's white. Come on Jason, help us. My tummy hurts. I can't lift heavy stuff. How old is Azuki today? 15? 18. Got enough candles? Plenty. 18, eh? She's all grown up. Sister Akino? Mother. Happy birthday. Mother... thanks. Where are you? A-zu-ki! Lemme x-ray you! I brought my truck! Know what day today is? I'm kidding! I gave up x-rays. I got nothing! Do what you want. Can I come up? You're freaky but cool! No objections! CONGRATULATIONS KINJIRO - 150 YEARS Tobishima Houichi had told a strange lie to Ninomiya Azuki before. Wanting to behave like an adult was... his guileless ulterior motive in saying he was divorced. He plans to apologize. It was a joke. Won't happen again. Sorry. Really sorry. Lately, he's been practicing saying this over and over. Odagiri Joe as Tobishima Houichi Kashii Yu as Ninomiya Azuki KIKI as Ninomiya Mihari.
