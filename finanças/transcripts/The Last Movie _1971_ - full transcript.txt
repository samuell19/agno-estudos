SubRip-Fixes by VaVooM Now, we're going to start... ...the beauty contest... ...for my movie. Music! Stop! Stop! Stop! Miss, come here. Very pretty. Very pretty. I congratulate you. You're going to do the part in the movie. Friends, music! Here, very well. Very nice. Cut! Cut! Cut! Cut! Cut! Stop! Good. They didn't want to come to my church anymore. They got carried away by that game. So I just wanted to... to show them that the same moralities that exist in the real church, can exist here in the facade, in the movie church. Right? So the only thing is that I hope that after this game is over, morality can be born again and that is what we should pray for Mr. Kansas. Wiffledem time If you wibble-de-wobble my wee If you fribble-de-fram on the side of my flan I will fribble-de-dibble your flee And you flipple-de-flam And you flipple-de-side of his flee And she wambled it on well his deed And she dibble-de-dam on the side of his flam And he donk-donk-donkled her free I prefer your condemnation to your suckin' sympathy.

Spaces between spaces And lines between lines She stands in the doorway Beyond space and time And she picks the flowers Out in the rain and She says she loves me and you know I can't complain But only when it rains does it rain And only when it stops it is no more And only once does the big ship come down To let those good rats run ashore Boy, this is the life. Isn't it? This is the life. Just nice and simple. Just give me a little adobe up there in that. Right up there in those rocks somewhere. I'll be a very happy man. Can we have a swimming pool, like the one you have in town? Why the hell do you want a swimming pool for with all that? Because I like a swimming pool. I bet you can buy this land around here dirt cheap. Probably get for under a dollar an acre. Yep. I bet I could buy the whole top of that mountain up there for practically nothing. For a nice simple adobe you don't need a whole mountain. You know, the top of that mountain up there is flat as a pancake. I'll bet you that you can put in a landing strip. You put in a landing strip, fly the people right in there, you build a hotel. I'll bet you could put in a ski jump. Ski slope around here. Somewhere. There is no snow here. Oh yeah. That's right. We're going to be so happy here. Even without a swimming pool and hotel? Aren't we? Well, I don't know about that. You're damn right we're going to be happy. Only thing is, how are you going to get people up there? That's the thing. Maybe put in a cable car. Yeah, probably put in a cable car. Just cable everybody right up there. Hey, Maria! I'm going into town. I'm going to see if there's any mail for me down there. Oh wait for me. I'll go with you. I'm just going to be gone a minute. Well, I have beauty appointment. What's the matter with your hair? Your hair looks fine? No, it's dirty. Well, why don't you wash it here then? I have beauty appointment and I must look beautiful. Hey, you know what I want let you buy me? One General Electric refrigerator. You know, there's an awful lot going out. There's nothing coming in and we're going to have to start economizing some way. Well, you want I go back to work? Okay. I support you. That don't mean we don't like to have nice things, Gringo. Just because we don't have electricity and running water, it don't mean we don't like to have nice things, Gringo. Alright, get it together. Let's go. I just can't understand that. I don't understand how I can get letters like this and I don't, I mean, I don't understand how they can build all those sets, afford to build those sets and not send movies down here. What the hell are we doing here? I got the horses down here. I mean, maybe they got more facilities in Mexico. Okay, but I mean this here, I mean they can't duplicate this anywhere. And this is just... I'm not even going to think about it. I'm going to play some checkers. That's what I'm going to do. Alright. I've been looking all over this damn place for you, boy. - How they hanging? - Two in a bunch. What the hell is going on here? What does it look like is going on? I'm standing on my hands. Looks like you shot Daffy Duck is what it looks like to me. - You did this, right? - Yeah, right. - You were out there bang bang. - Got my carbine, five in a row. - Bam, bam, bam. - They fell down just like a gook. You love that damn war, man. It's like a childhood sweetheart to you, ain't it? Hey listen, what the hell? I want to play some checkers. I want to take some money from you. Now look, think of me as a map. I can taste it. I can smell it. And I got it right up here. A Goddamnest gold mine you ever saw in your whole life. And all I need is 500 bucks. 500 lousy bucks. And you want to talk to me about those Hollywood fruits and all those guys you working with. I'm trying to make you a rich man. That's what we call Hollywood's... That's a big old box office. That's what that is. Oh yes. Flashing it up, boy. They're flashing it up now. Do your feet hurt, baby? Yeah, they're swollen. It's those shoes. Hey, wait a minute. I know them. I know her. I know them. - You know them? - Yeah. Okay now. I've seen them. I've seen them on the movie set. I think they're married, man. - How do you like my new bath oil? - I love it, I will have to try it. Yeah. I'm right there with you, but let me cool it, okay? Now you go ahead. You turn around. Okay. - Is it my move? - Yes, it certainly is. Okay. Hi, Mrs. Anderson, Miss Anderson. Well, hello. Do I know you? Ah yes, I'm Neville Robey. I met you once when I came to your husband's factory, broom factory, and tried to get a job. Oh yes. How are you? Hot! So am I. Are you hot? Oh yes. I'm very hot. You're hot too, huh? I'm hot. You're hot. You're hot. I'm hot. Are you hot? I'm the hottest. This is Kansas. He's hot too. - I'm Kansas. - Kansas. We're all hot. We've got some cool drinks coming for you now. We just ordered four, because we got this mix and everything and we better drink it up here. We'll give you two of them. We got this Julio de Penis. How long have you boys been drinking this afternoon? What did you say? I mean, after all that naughty talk we shouldn't take those drinks. But I guess we will anyway. Really, it'll cool you off and make you a lot hotter, I'll tell you that. Well, even if you're terrible, I guess we'll take them. Did you know also that you can tell the size of a man by, size of a woman, by the size of her mouth. And the other lady looked at her and says, "ooh, is that so?" Did I ever tell you the joke about the midget? He was in love. Real shy, you see. And he was in love with this real tall blonde, but he couldn't find anybody to put him up to it. That's good. That's real good. Put him up to it. Terrific, Harry. That's the reason I went into the broom business, you see? It's because all these witches in the whole world. Riding around these old, dirty brooms with these long sweeps on them. You know? So I said I'm going into the broom business if for nothing else is to get all the riches in the world, witches in the world, into new brooms. Oh come on, there's got to be one laugh! How many times have you told that story now? - Maybe 85,000 times. - Yeah, about 85,000 times. Yeah, along with all the other stories. Yeah. I believe you'd rather make bad jokes than make money and that's really saying something. Harry, are you by any chance interested in gold? Yeah, you outta see the map all over his face? He's got... tell them about the map you've got all over your face. Come on. No. I have a gold mine, you see. And I need $500, which isn't very much. I need $500 as a backing. You've got a gold mine and you need $500? Is that right? And it's right out there, just for the taking. All you need is to take it. - Well, how about that? - What did you do? Put a garbage lid on it and walk away to tell somebody about it? So we can all walk over and pick up that garbage lid and make ourselves millionaires. Come one, Neville. Who do you think you're talking to? I think it would be fun. Let's go get a goldmine and we'll all get rich. - Right. - Then we'll go to Hollywood. - Yeah, that's right. - We'll all go to Hollywood. - That's terrific. - And I'm telling you something. I'm willing to spend part of it right now if we can think of something to do for some excitement. You fellas must know everything there is in town. - I mean, what's good around town? - What? What? What? For entertainment. You know, something lively. With a little action in the game. Oh. Well... ...the best show in town... and if you pardon me ladies, it's the whorehouse. - Do they let ladies in? - Of course they let ladies in. - They do? - Yeah, but they don't let them out! You ready then? Why, Harry. I'm surprised at you. Wait a second. There are ladies here now. Well, hell. There's nothing wrong with an orgy. That's not what's going on now. Not orgies. Come on. You mean, what do you call it? I know what you mean. A circ... a circus. - That's it. - That's it, listen. - Yes sir. - Could you arrange it? Yes, sir. We can arrange that. - Money is no object. - Like an expedition. Right. That's it. You can arrange it. - A circus. - Yeah. That's great. Do you ladies want to see something like that? I've always wanted to see what it was like. - There's a lot of romance to them. - Oh, Christ. There really is. Boy, you Americans get out of your own country and come down here, you think you look at anything, don't tell me you'd be doing that in River City. You come down to a foreign country you think you can look at that kind of thing, don't you? There's got to be some advantage in being here. Right? Alright, money's no object. You know that, right? Yes, sir. Okay. Let's drink to that. To brooms and all the girls that ride them. Right? To all the whores in the world. To all the small mouths. That's right! On her titties. Excuse me. Oh, let me help you on with that. It sure feels good. Now it explains why. I never understood before why people liked all that. You know? You know why? Because people got hair all over their bodies. Does that feel good? What the hell are you doing here, man? You should have had your coat on and be out of here by now. Wait a second, let me finish this. - Kansas. - Huh? I want to go home now. - What? - I want to go home. Now, look. You haven't been with me all evening now. You've been ignoring me all evening now. Now don't you start this "I want to go home" stuff. I don't want them to know what I am. What are you talking about? Know what you are? What the hell do they care what you are? You're with me. I'm paying the bills, you know. Now you just get your ass out into that car now. Come one. You straighten up here. I'd like to see two broads out there! Listen to me. Goddammit listen to me. - Two broads. - Listen to me now. - Listen to me. Goddamn. - Alright, Kansas. I'm not trying to get much attention here. - Alright, let's hear it. - I was trying to talk, too. I want to get the Goddamn scene together. Now I got to arrange this business, right Harry? - That's right. It's all paid for. - Right now. - I got to know what the hell... - Serious business. Okay, what do you want to see, damn it? - Two broads! - Okay. Two girls. - Miss Anderson and Mrs. Anderson. - Is that okay? Well, I think it's a pretty good deal. - Two girls. - Why not? Maria. Hey, Goddammit. Now listen to me. Now Maria, we want two girls now. Alright? Now I'm just talking, you know, but I just think the ones we'd like would be that girl that stars in that. - That singer. - You pointed her out to me. Wait a second, she was there with Rockwell man, at the party. Now that girl, that'll be good. - Alright. - And okay. - Alright. - And whoever is with her. Now is that right? Is that a deal? You're Goddamn right! Oh yeah, baby! Oh, shake it baby! Shake it! Ohh! No, no honey. Go away. - Fuzzy wuzzy was a bear. - You like that? - Oh, I like hair. - Yeah? I've figured it all out. It's all hair. Is that what it is? You're awful cute, cowboy. What if I wasn't a cowboy, would you still like me? I don't think so. Harry. That's it. That's the one. That's the one I'm trying to get for us. I'll sing her. Oh, we got her, boy. Money's no object, right, Harry? That's what I said. Didn't I? - Money's no object. - Right. We're family now, ain't we Harry? - That's for sure. - Family now boy. Family, eh, Nev! Hey, we're family now! Goldmine and everything. It's all in. Now that's what I call family. That's what I call family. That's family, boy. Thank you baby. Thank you. And the sun of hope Rises from the dawn The light shines bright on last night's dreams Maria's dreams Through jungles, suns and moons Ricochet her reveries Flying through hills and mountains Maria's dreams They pierce closed hearts Open closed minds Reveal the truth to lying men They course through the land Crying out for more life In the years of Maria The dreams of Maria She sleeps like the stones That pave winding roads But like flowers through the cracks sprout always The dreams of Maria Hurry! Hurry! Good evening. Be careful. I've been waiting for you. Start it now, Marietta. Start that machine now. Start that machine. What are you doing? Hurry! - I am the Mistress. - I am the Maid. Now hurry up! So that means the Mistress and the Maid. The Mistress and the Maid. She's playing the Mistress, and then she's playing the Maid. How's the little lovebird doing? Oh wow. My brassiere. Hurry! This is damn pretty. Oh boy. Here, fasten it! Marietta! Now there it goes. Goddamn, let's see a little more action here. My friends here are getting bored to hell here. I want to see a little breast sucking. Move a little bit. Oh! Come on... Tell Maria I want to see a little more... Now! Gringo, shut up! Well, Goddamn. Get it on. Which man? Or woman? What have you got that I haven't got? Is it what's in your pants, or what is in your pocket? I want you to know something, boy. I got plenty in my pants and I got plenty in my pocket. And I buy this little lady here everything she needs. Nino, you underprivileged bastard. You turned her into a whore. That's what you did. No! No, no, no. Kansas. Don't go out there. Come on. We're having a party, huh. Come on. We're having a party. We don't need that, right? Come on, everybody. Let's have the party. Get going. No, I didn't do anything! I didn't do anything! I didn't do anything. Oh God, no! You gotta be kidding? I mean, I'd have to move out of this house. We'd have to move out of this house and move in with your parents. I ain't going to do no foolhardy thing like that. No, ma'am. Well, I don't care. I want the fur coat of Mrs. Anderson. You beat Maria up? Why you bad boy, you. - Yeah, well, I, you know... - How'd you do it? - I just slapped her. - Did you hit her with your fist? No, my hands. I just slapped her real hard. Listen... I... look listen to me for one minute. You know, I have fantasies like that. About... ...of being beat up. You ever have a fantasy about women hitting you? Or do cowboys have fantasies? I don't think I ever got into any of that. Yeah, No? Well, we'll see about all that. Won't we? Yeah, listen. I... I gotta buy your fur coat. I mean it's crazy. It's a long story. My fur coat? It's what she wants. That's what she wants. What she wants? And I told her... - I told her I'll get it. - She wants my fur coat? - Yeah. - Why, that little whore. And so, I thought that we could help him out, because I thought we could sell him... - ... Cress' old mink's fur. - I really appreciate it. It was a present. Well, yes. I know it is, baby, but you haven't worn it in about five years and I didn't think you'd mind. - You don't mind do you? - I'm in trouble, I'll tell you that. - There's a problem, huh? - Oh, boy. Cress, I already told Kansas that he could have it. - Okay? - That's right. Look, are you going to answer me or not? Cress, I've already told him we'd do it. So that's that, and we'll talk about it later. No! No! Isn't that typical? And off she goes with the little dolly. I didn't want to cause anybody any problems. I just, I... I'm sorry you have to see this, Kansas. Okay. Yeah, look. Come on, let's, we'll be back in a minute. I'll take him upstairs for the stole. - I certainly appreciate it. - Well, lots of luck. - I'll see you later. - I'll be right back. - Hey, Kansas. - Huh? Take off, I'll get you on the rise. Thank you. Boy, Harry's really into hunting, isn't he? Oh yeah. This place is such a mess. Harry kills everything. And he never throws anything away. I know I saw it up here somewhere. I saw it about a couple months ago. I think it was over in this area somewhere. Ah, here it is. I sure hate to trouble you like this, Mrs. Anderson. - Oh that's alright, that's alright. - Oh that's pretty. It's real pretty. Is this what you have in mind? - That'll be great. - Yeah? That'll be great. She'll be very happy. You really need this, huh? You really want it? Oh yes ma'am. It's going to make her very happy. So what would you do for it? I'll do anything you ask me, Mrs. Anderson. Would you do anything? Anything at all? Nice and soft, isn't it? Hmm. It feels good. Yeah? What does that remind you of? You sure make me hot. Get you all nice and hot, cowboy. You'll do anything for it? Would you do anything I told you to? - Yes, ma'am. - You'd do anything I told you to? I said I'll do anything. Alright, then get down on your knees. Aw, come on. Get down on your knees, cowboy! I said get down on your knees. I want you to beg me for it. Right now! Well, that's sort of silly, but I... It's not silly. You do exactly what I tell you to do. You understand me? Here I am, ma'am. You've been a bad boy, cowboy. You beat up your whore last night, didn't you? I lost my hat. That's alright, you leave your hat off. You leave your hat off when you're begging to a lady. - You understand me? - Yes, ma'am. You do what I tell you to from now on and we'll get along just fine. Okay? You beat up your whore last night, but you're my whore now. It's beautiful. I want you to move everything out of here. Move everything back to your mother's. All right? Okay. Neville and I will go find gold. Oh, I love, my darling. There it is baby. There it is. All our lives we've got to take shit and try to make gold out of it. But by God, we're going for gold this time, Neville. There it is. You put it in your pocket. There it is. We're going. Well, Goddamn, my buddy. Goddamn you buddy, Goddamn you! We're going to find it too. - You know that, don't you? - You're damn right. Let's get it in your pocket. Let's get the hell out of here. Let's get it. It's not worth it. It's not commercial. They'll lose money, as they need to build highways, roads to be able to start this... They're not going to get their investment fast enough. He says that you will lose money, because it is not close to a road. It's too expensive to develop at 250 miles off the road. You've got to get trucks and equipment there. If you go and do it, it's going to cost you at least 500 bucks for a mile for a road and that's a $125,000, Neville. Well, Hell. You got a lot of money. We'll do it together? I'll make you my partner. We'll all be partners. Hell, there's enough for everybody there. That's speculation. Now, wait. Just wait a minute. Now wait a minute. You're trying to tell me, that... that dude knows some sons of bitches that'll buy my mine, but you sons of bitches won't help me develop it? The thing you can do is to sell it over to some big combine, some big mining outfit and make yourself a bundle. It'll be a long time to get what they invested. What the hell's he saying? What's he saying? He says it is very difficult, because it is very far away from a road. Twenty years to recover what it will cost you now. Twenty years to get your money. If you had to come up with this money, you've got a paying mine. What are you trying to say, Harry Broomman? What I'm trying to say is there are a lot of big companies you can sell it to and make yourself a bundle. Huh? What'd I tell you? You sons of bitches! You want my mine. Well, you're not going to get my mine. Nobody's going to get my mine. Goddamn, Harry. - Who called in the assayer? - You did it, you bastard! It was our agreement that you pick him out. You don't think I got gold? I'll show you. Give me your hand. Give me your hand! Look at this. You don't think I have gold? I paid her off in gold. - Look at that. - I want my money. Don't you think if he had gold, that I wouldn't be the first guy who would want to jump in here? Hell, money's my stock and trade, man. Ever since I got into this broom thing. Get out of here! Alright, get out! Come on everybody get... Get out of here! I've heard enough Goddamn lemonade. Get out of here. Get out of here! Come on out! Okay, okay now. I think everybody better leave now. Just leave me with my boy here. - All right. - You get out and take this hooker with you. Out! I want my money, Gringo! I want my money! - You'll get your money, baby. - Give me my money. You'll get your money. Get the hell out of here! Please, everybody. Okay? Get her out! Get her out of here. Just get out. Tell him to forget it. Better leave them alone. Don't you forget about my money, eh? - All right, all right. - Get your ass out of here! Come on, alright. We'll get it together now. Break my ass, will he? Well, we got it buddy. Goddamn it. We got it, we got it, we got it. We got it, buddy, ain't we? We found it didn't we? - Yeah, we found it... - Didn't we buddy, goddamn we found it. If we found a hell of a lot more than that, we're friends you know that? Okay, that's all that really matters. We found gold that's more than any of those assholes ever did, and we found it, we ain't ever gonna be rich. We ain't ever gonna be rich, Nev. But we found it. Okay? Shit man, we're gonna be rich. We're already rich. We don't need that stuff. We found it. You know... Oh God. When I was a little boy, my old man was a... Goddamn... he was a failure. He was the Goddamndest failure you ever saw in your life. Bet he was a hell of a nice guy though. Here's to your father. Yeah, here's to all... Goddammit. Yeah, buddy. Goddammit. Goddamn you - Goddamn you! - Gringo. Quickly, quickly. I want the camera here. Careful with the camera. Here, a little bit this way. Sit here, please. Put the mic on this side. - Everything's ready Mr. Director. - Everything's ready? To the jail. To the jail. Now we're going to the jail. Help him. Take him over there. Open the door.

You know, that's what's wrong, cause we brought the movies, you know. That's where we made our mistake. No. It's not true. It's just for fun. Oh, for fun, huh? Yeah. You say it's for fun and all of them, they all say it's for fun, huh? And you know what the priest says, don't you? The damn priest says it's a game! I'll tell you something. You know what?

I mean, you would know gold if you saw it. Hell yes, I would. Wouldn't you? Hell no I wouldn't. How the hell would I know it? Did you see "Treasure of the Sierra Madre"? - Yeah. - Okay. Did you see "Lust for Gold"? - Nuh uh. - Okay. You saw "Treasure of the Sierra Madre". - Right. - Alright. Well, Walter Huston found gold, didn't he? I can find it. Well, what the hell does that have to do with knowing what it looks like? I mean, have you ever seen any gold? Have you ever really seen any gold? You mean like gold nuggets you mean? I mean seeing gold, like gold, gold, gold. Yeah, here my ring. No I mean that comes off of the ground, damn it. - It comes right off... - No, no. - I never have, but that's not... - Well, what's your reference. I mean now that... what school did you go to? I didn't go to school. I only went to the 8th grade. Well, I mean you've read books about it. - I mean you've... - One book I told you I read about it. - What book? - I can't remember the title. Oh, come on man! Now you got to be putting me on now, damn it. I mean I... I mean you got mercury with you. Don't you? Hell no. What do I need mercury for? Don't kid me any more now, Neville. Seriously now. - No. - I mean you got mercury with you? No. What do I have to have mercury for? You pan gold with mercury. That's what you use when you're panning to separate it. Walter Huston didn't have mercury, did he? Oh now, come on. Don't, don't give me any of this movie thing now. I mean, come on, you got to be... you're teasing me about this. I mean, you know how to find gold? Yeah, I know how to find gold. - Well? - What do you think I'm doing here? You just walk out until you see a mountain that has some valleys in it, like little ridges in it where maybe a river could come out. Honest to God, I mean... - You may... - And you think it's yellow, right? - Like your ring. - Is the ring yellow? I mean you find rings laying all over the ground? I didn't say you were going to find rings, but you're going to find pieces of gold and then you know it came from up there in the mountains, and you just go up and get it. And that's it. Now just reassure me. I know you got to be putting me on I know you're teasing me. It's fun and games and all that. Just tell me. - You know how to find gold? - I know how to find gold. You know it? I know just as much as I knew before, maybe more because you told me about the mercury, which I didn't know before. Next time I come out I'll bring some mercury, but I don't know what the hell mercury's - got to do with it. - Okay, okay. You got a sense of humor. All right. Which way are we going, tomorrow? - Well... - I mean, the sun comes up, I know, and the moon goes down and all that. We'll keep heading that way. - We keep heading that way. - West. Keep heading west. God is everywhere. SubRip-Fixes by VaVooM
