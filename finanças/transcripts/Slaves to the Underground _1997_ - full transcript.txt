[MUSIC PLAYING] SUZY: (SINGING) Wait naked in my shadow, playing with your ego. It must be hard, hard, hard. It must be hard, hard, hard. Wait, wait 'til you walk on air. Fill me up with your care. It must be hard, hard, hard. It must be hard, hard, hard. I'd like to fuck you up, I'd like to see you scared, I want to see you drop, drop, drop. I'd like to fuck you up, I'd like to see you scared, I want to see drop, drop, drop. Thought in your decision, time in your position. I am your illusion, I am your illusion. I'd like to fuck you up, I'd like to see you scared, I want to see you drop, drop, drop. I'd like to fuck you up, I'd like to see you scared, I want to see you drop, drop, drop. I remember your day left inside. Live to see you die. Live to see you die. Live to see you die. I'd like to fuck you up, I'd like to see you scared, I'd like to see you drop, drop drop. I'd like to fuck you up, I'd like to see you scared, I want to see you drop. I want to see you scared, I want to fuck you up. I want to fuck you up, I want to see you scared, I want to see you scared, I want to see you scared. I want to see you scared, I want to see you scared, I want to see you scare, I'd like to (WHISPERING) see you scared. SHELLY: (VOICEOVER) "The Graduate" is my mother's favorite movie. And the other night it occurred to me that it's actually a movie about a stalker. I mean, here's this guy who's obsessed with this girl, and even though she tells him to go away and her parents tell him to go away, he keeps after her, follows her around, and then trashes her wedding. The Dustin Hoffman character is actually a selfish irresponsible proto-slacker, who at the end of the film takes this poor girl hostage. It's your basic romantic slacker stalker film. And this was a movie that defined a generation. My parents' generation. [DRUMSTICKS CLICKING] [MUSIC PLAYING] SUZY: (SINGING) A cast away came in one night to oversee world below, he waved his moon goodbye. SHELLY: Bye-bye. SUZY: Were you the one who was meant for me? Were you the one? SHELLY: Never know. Never know. Never know. Hey, Suzy. Check it out. [LAUGHING] Let's go. Hi. Are we having fun? Can I look at that? Oh, wow. Pretty pussies, huh? What would you say if I said, I'll show you mine if you show me yours? What? Come on. The backroom over there. My girlfriends will watch the front. SHELLY: Go on. She won't bite. Not unless you want her to. Come on. Put them in here. Here, put them in this. Why don't you take your shoes off, too. Otherwise you're going to trip when I go down on you. [LAUGHING] Come on, let's go! Come on! Hey! [LAUGHING] I got 17, Jimmy. You want to count them? No, I trust you. BIG PHIL: I'm surprised you trust anybody. So, we got 17 left. I left you 50 last week. How about I leave 40. Sounds good to me. So what's this? Oh, I'm promoting some all ages shows down at Mo's. Mo Roc'n Cafe. JIMMY: These guys any good? - Yeah. For an all girl band, they rock. Cool. All right, I'll see you later. Adios. JOE: This is Joe Bunch, on AM 640. We've been talking about national health care. The issue that never completely goes away. First of all, I'm not interested in paying anybody else's medical bills. I mean really, if you can't afford to get sick, then don't get sick. Second of all, all these people that think universal health care is the answer have never even been to these other countries. - Hey, roomie? Hey Jimmy? Hey look. JOE: (ON RADIO) Face it. the United States has got the greatest doctors in the world because we have choice. Let's go to the phones. First caller. JIMMY: Yeah Joe, this is Marvin from Clydehill calling, and I've got a couple of things to say regarding your views on health care. Get fucked, you old hack. What kind of a choice do the poor people have in this country? That's just another example-- [DIAL TONE] Dammit. JOE: (ON RADIO) If I'm not mistaken that sounds like our old friend Jimmy in Wallingford. Hey, nice try Jimmy. All right caller two, talk to me. Shit. Dale. Jimmy, what's up? What's up? Where have you been? You just took off without saying a word. I had some personal things to take care of. - You want a beer? - Yeah. You? Yeah. Yeah, he called me out of the blue this morning. I just picked him up at the airport. JIMMY: How long have you been away? About a year. I'm going to move back, though. He's got a job interview at Microsoft. Ah-ha. So, you want to get a job on the campus, do you? Yeah. I've been working for a small software company for about a year. So I just figured. You just figured you'd sell out, like everybody else in this town. - Come on man. What do you want to give him a hard time for? I wouldn't be caught dead working for Microsoft. Bill Gates is Satan. It's just a job interview. Still trying to save the world? Is this a new one? JIMMY: It's number 28. Got about 200 mail in subscribers, and I sell them down at Big Phil's store, too. They're $1 apiece, and after expenses you must clear what, $150, $200 a month, huh? Hey, we're going to go down to Mo tonight. You want to come? Count me in. JIMMY: Zines are the future. They say that daily newspapers will be all but extinct by the beginning of the next century. I say good riddance. Mainstream media is such-- it's such a crock. Look what I'm wearing. Look at my haircut. Am I a slacker? My part of Generation X. The mainstream media would focus on me, and they would label me in a second. There's people out there who would believe it. Sooner or later people are going to be tired of hearing lies. They're going to want to know the truth. And when they do, guys like me will be around to give it to them. [MUSIC PLAYING] (SINGING) Yah, yah, yow! What is this shit? JIMMY: These guys are an Olympia band. DALE: Oh, great. Hey, Jimmy, isn't that your old girlfriend over there? (SINGING) to see if she can find a reason for what's wrong and right. Yeah, it is. Who you guys looking at? Oh, nobody. You going to go talk to her? Nope. Why not? Because. You guys want something to drink? I'll have a beer. - You? - Yeah. I'm going to go take a dump. I'll hang out here. (SINGING) In the entire world, she's impossible [INAUDIBLE].. Spend a days [INAUDIBLE] in community [INAUDIBLE].. And at night she goes out-- Big Phil. How's the [INAUDIBLE] Jimmy? So far, so good. Well, that's great. Listen, thanks for coming out. And let me know how good it gets. - I will. - All right, I'll see you later. Yeah, take it easy. Three Luckies, please. (SINGING) Add to the girl trying to change the world you got to knock on the door. That's him. [INAUDIBLE] (SINGING) She's impossible to ignore. Revolution! What the hell you doing here, man? I told you never to come back here, man. I told you, you fucking son of a bitch. God damn-- ugh! ZOE: Hey, Suzy. Suzy, Suzy. Come on. Oh, shit. Here. You come back here, I'm going to kill you! Come on. JIMMY: Excuse me. Excuse me. Please. Dale? Jesus, what was that about? Nothing. A little misunderstanding. A little misunderstanding? She beat the shit out of you, pal. Come on, let me see. Oh! Oh man, we gotta get him to an emergency room. I think she broke his nose. Yeah. Swedish Hospital is the closest. Take my car. I'll hook up with you guys later. OK? Whoa, whoa, whoa, you're not going to stay for the show, are you? JIMMY: Yeah, why not? What good is it going to do if I go? Besides, I want to find out what happened. You're going to talk to Shelly, aren't you? JIMMY: Yeah. Come on, Dale. She's trouble, you know. (SINGING) Do we have to have this talk again. I've an answer. Are you going to threaten to walk again? I'm too frantic. It's a kick-- SHELLY: Guess who? I was just looking for you. And here I am. Been a while. Yeah, it has. So, was that your friend that beat up my friend? Your friend? You gotta be more selective, dude. I could say the same, dude. Brian had to take Dale to the hospital. What's her name broke his nose. Her name's Suzy. And he's lucky she didn't break his arm. Why? Because, that's why. What's with you? Why won't you tell me what's going on? Why what? Why did your girlfriend beat up Dale? Come here. (SIGNING) We had thunder. Cloud of dust is what I need, [INAUDIBLE] You're sure it was Dale? Of course you're sure. I don't know what to say. I didn't know. Well, now you do. (SINGING) I'm too frantic. I can't believe you didn't tell me. I didn't think you'd understand. SUZY: Yo, Shelly! Come on, we gotta go in a minute. Look, I can't talk. I got to go play. Oh, I work at Little Wonder's Preschool if you ever need to get a hold of me. It was nice seeing you again. GIRL: Suzy! Woo! Suzy, you rock! Hey, you got that right. Hi, everybody. Were the No Exits, and I wanted to start off by telling you something. That we started this band because we saw other women in bands. And if we can do it, so can you, whether it's a band or a zine or whether-- [ELECTRIC GUITAR PLAYING] Please stop that. Or a movement. You can do it as well. OK? [APPLAUSE] [MUSIC PLAYING] (SINGING) Ellen catch a wave came one night to oversee the world below and bid this world goodbye. Bye-bye. Were you the one who was meant for me. Were you the one. Never know. Never know. Never know. Hey! This capsule [INAUDIBLE] too high, he wouldn't hurt you. I'll be your insect on the wall. I'll be your information. Never know, never know, never know. If it was all up to me. I see the panic, I see the panic in his eyes. Never mind, never mind. Never mind. Never mind. Queen Boudicca was this really cool Celtic queen. She inherited her kingdom from my husband, but the Romans didn't like that, because they believed in patriarchy. You know, male dominance. So they show up one day, and they beat her. Rape her two daughters in front of the entire tribe, and announce that they're in control. And in response, she raised an army of men and women, and proceeds to level three Roman towns, including Londonium. And after every victory, they would hang the bodies up on posts, and sew private parts like penises and breasts on the faces of the dead. Ah, she would have taken control of all of England. But the Celts started getting liquored up, and you know how those Irish folks get when they get drunk, so. She got mortally wounded the last big battle, but she managed to escape with her daughters. They said she ended up dying at Stonehenge. And they never found her daughters. All I know is, she didn't put up with any shit. [MUSIC PLAYING] [CHEERING] You remember the rules. One beer girls, [INAUDIBLE] Where is Shelly? [LIGHT GUITAR PLAYING] SHELLY: (SINGING) Sometimes the truth is all you have left. I like that. Is it new? SHELLY: Yeah. It's a little folky for the band, though. First star. I'm not going to get my wish. You just might. Who was that guy I saw you talking to tonight? Which guy? Don't be coy. It was your ex-boyfriend, wasn't it? That Jimmy. He went to Evergreen with us. Yeah, that was him. So he's friends that Dale guy. That's pretty fucked up. He knows him. But how could he be friends with that guy? I never told him about being raped. Oh. Must have been some great relationship if you didn't tell him. It wasn't a bad relationship. Me and Jimmy used to have a lot of fun. I'm, sorry, I'm just jealous, that's all. It's nothing like our relationship, though. [GUITAR PLAYING] PAUL: I'm telling you, Jim, these little wars that are popping up. It's all part of a conspiracy. Are you listening? What will you have? Where's Kathy? She's got the night off. Oh. Well, I'll have two eggs, scrambled hard. Bacon, and the rye toast. Anything to drink? Coffee. And a Lucky lager. Great diet you got going there, pal. Hey, Jimmy. Paul. JIMMY: How'd you know I was here? You weren't at home. How's Dale? Dale is on his way back to L.A. I though he had a job interview. Yeah, so did I. But as soon as we left the emergency room he said, take me back to the airport. What happened? Some girls beat up our friend, Dale. Wow. Beaten up by chicks. That's really-- Intense. Yeah, intense. WAITRESS: You want anything. Yeah, water. So did he say why he left? BRIAN: Yeah. He said he forgot how much it rains in Seattle. So what did Shelly say? Nothing. BRIAN: Come on, she had to say something. I'm telling you, she didn't say anything. You are the worst liar. So how was the band? JIMMY: They were really great. Who? The No Exits. BRIAN: The chicks that beat up our friend, Dale. Oh, well that figures. Aren't they one of those bands from Olympia? They don't put up with any shit. Here you go. I ordered bacon. - Yeah, you did. Sorry, I'll have them make it right away. Also, could I get those eggs scrambled hard? You want them cooked longer? JIMMY: Yeah. I want to cook longer with bacon. I get it. This always happens to me here. PAUL: But you keep coming back anyway. So come on, what did Shelly say? Why did they beat up Dale? You really want to know? BRIAN: Yeah, I really want to know. Shelly said that Dale raped her. No way. That's why they beat him up. BRIAN: Oi, that's bullshit. I don't think so. Why would she lie? - I don't know. Why would he rape her? He can get any girl he wants. Rape isn't about sex, it's about power. Here you go. What is this? It's what you asked. Eggs scrambled with bacon. - No, I-- I didn't want the eggs scrambled with the bacon. I wanted the bacon-- Is this guy a friend of yours? Yeah. OK, then why is he giving me a hard time? Yeah, Jimmy? What are you, an asshole? JIMMY: No, I'm not. Look. They're fine. They should be. It's what you asked for. No, it isn't. There's no way. They're wrong. Maybe they are. Come on, callers. Isn't there any intelligent life out there on planet Earth? All right next hour, I want to talk about this article I read in today's paper. On the subject of so-called acquaintance rape, or date rape. They found that nearly 80% of these women had been molested as children. I'm not one to argue with their results. But they conclude that quote, "these women don't know how to set boundaries." And what does that mean? It's a bunch of bunk. Bunk. Bottom line is, they don't know how to say no. And whose fault is that? No, I think most of these young ladies seduced their daddies. Now they're all grown up and they're seducing the young men of America. Come on, ladies. Time to take responsibility for your actions. Shouldn't you girls be home studying? Hey, Suzy. You guys kicked ass last Friday. We always kick ass. You got that right. Hey, Suzy, we started a zine. Really? That's cool. Why don't you send it to me? We have an address in the back of our seven inch. I'll let you know what I think. Hey. Don't I know you from somewhere? - Sort of. You beat up a friend of mine last Friday. Oh, the rapist. He's not a rapist. Right. So what happened to him? I haven't seen him around lately. Yeah, after they set his nose in the emergency room, he went back down to L.A. SUZY: Aw, that's too bad the folks in Southern California. Here's 12. Keep the change. Excuse me. Excuse me. Don't you think it's odd that your friend would go back to L.A. instead of going to the cops? I think it's a little more odd that a girl would say she was raped, and not go to the cops. See you around, Shelly. Does anybody want to have some fun tonight? You girls want something? Yeah. I got an idea. This hasn't happened to me since I did rock and roll. Hi. Who are you? I'm Suzy, and I'm back. We're back. And what do I get if I put you on the radio? Who is our caller? JOE: This hour we about breast feeding in restaurants. Ladies, you didn't bring enough for everybody, leave them at home. Oh, so it takes a real man to screw a girl who can't even stand up. Is that how you guys get most of your dates? There's no excuse for rape. Next? BILL (ON PHONE): Hi, this is Bill from Lynwood. Oh, it takes a lot of guts to admit that. Go on. BRIAN (ON PHONE): Yeah, I'm surprised there's not more sexual assault on women. Look what you wear, the skimpy skirts, and the bras with no shirts on. I see where this is going. So if we get dressed up, and then we complain about getting raped, then that's not real good. That's great, yeah, you really are from Lynwood, aren't you? Next. And I don't think we should limit it to sex offenders, either. Mean date rapists, men who sexually harass women. I mean, I think should cut off all their balls. See something you like, grandpa? CALLER (ON PHONE): Hey, where's Joe. What's it to you? CALLER (ON PHONE): I'll tell you what it is to me. And I own this station. And you're aren't breaking several laws that I know of, and probably several others, including kidnapping, which is a felony. SHELLY: Oh, great. CALLER (ON PHONE): The cops are on their way right now. OK, let's go. CALLER (ON PHONE): You'd just better hope that Joe isn't hurt, because if he is-- Listen, we're going to leave you with a song that we really, really like, and thank you so much for listening. Good night. Goodbye, sweetie. Have a good one. Let's go. All right. [GRUNTING] [CHEERING] [LAUGHING] Let's go, let's go. Stop, or I'll shoot! Oh, like you'd really shoot a girl. Come on. SUZY: (SINGING) This girl that you know well. She last a minute strong. She's stress your own men's smiles with that TV on. With a fashion magazine, they lay across the floor. With closet full of new clothes that she never wore. She's always dressed for every occasion, smiles and perfume her persuasion. You know Lisa. With any bad joke, she'll laugh, I've heard her laugh. Pick her out a [INAUDIBLE] and say, cry. He goes, such a bitch. She says she knows, but it's OK. 'Cause when she on top, they made love anyway. She's always dressed for every occasion, smiles and perfume her persuasion, You know Lisa. You know Lisa. You know Lisa. You know Lisa. It's OK. It's the way she likes to be. And most say she's just funny that way, she does it cleverly. She's always dressed for every occasion, smiles and perfume, her persuasion, you know Lisa. You know Lisa. You know Lisa. You know Lisa. You know Lisa. You know Lisa. I'm going to go to the bathroom. Love you. Love you too. OK some things I hate about Cindy Crawford. First off let me just say that I don't hate Cindy Crawford. I don't even know Cindy Crawford. But she's made a choice to represent a standard that women find impossible achieve. In fact, even Cindy herself hasn't achieved that shag rug eyelash perky breast look that we all see on the cover of Cosmo. It's all airbrushed and computer enhanced. And speaking of choice, some people say that women are programed and don't really have a choice about what they do in life. But in my opinion, Cindy isn't done. In fact, if other models put as much time and effort into exploring their intelligence, or creativity as they do into plucking their eyebrows, injecting their lips or bending over in front of the camera, we'd have cured cancer by now. But Cindy has allowed herself to be a dupe for all those assholes who go to our clubs and the places where we hang out, see what we're wearing. Then they go back to their Manhattan high rise offices, draw a picture of it, have some poor oppressed women in Taiwan sew it up for a couple of cents. Slap it on Cindy's ass, so she can wiggle down the runway and sell it to a bunch of rich mother fuckers for a grand and a half. Then we go back to the same place to buy the same shit we bought last week, because it was comfortable. Only now the price is five times higher, because it's hip and trendy. I don't think so. SUZY: I don't think we're going to be able to practice tonight, because I gotta go see my mom. It's her birthday. SHELLY: I'm sorry. Why are you sorry? I know how much you hate seeing your mom. I wouldn't go, but she called last night. How is she? Well, she was drunk. As usual. Could hear her boyfriend in the background. She's cocktailing, and he's on disability. God, what a bunch of losers. Sometimes I wish she would die. Do you really? No. I do wish she'd go away, though. Can I ask you a question? SUZY: Sure. Did anything ever happen to you when you were growing up? Like what? Like did any of your mom's boyfriends ever-- No. No one ever fucked with me. Or should I say no one ever fucked me. Unless I let them. I never let them. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you. SUZY: You didn't upset me. Oh, I got a call from Debra yesterday. SHELLY: Who's that? My friend that went to Washington D.C. a little while ago. SHELLY: Oh, right. She works with this group, Stop The Violence. She organizes demonstrations and lobbying. It's like, there are so many activists down there right now. She really loves it. What are you saying? I don't know, I-- I sometimes feel like if I was in New York, if I was in D.C. I could be doing something more. I mean don't you ever feel like we should be doing more? For the cause. Well, what about the music? No, I'd never leave the band. No, what about the music? What do you mean? I mean, music for music's sake. I think music is a means to an end. Well, I'm not sure I agree with you. Of course you agree with me. You always agree with me. That's what makes you so great. - Yeah, right. SHELLY: Hi. Hey. SHELLY: What are you doing here? I was just in the neighborhood. Thought I'd stop by. What? It's just such a stupid thing to say. What's so stupid? Well, I was just in the neighborhood. I'm sure you were. So, where are we going? I don't know. Thought maybe we could go for some coffee at Lula's or something? Why don't we just go to your house? It's in the next block, isn't it? How'd you know? I've passed a couple of times. I was just in the neighborhood. Let me get my things. I like this cartoon. Which one? The one where the girl carries the guy's penis around with her. Oh, that one. SHELLY: So you're really into this shit, aren't you? JIMMY: Yeah. I'm very interested in getting my message out there any way I can. You really didn't think you could tell me? No, I didn't. That kind of hurts. Still can't believe a friend of mine would do something like that. Well, he did. How? I don't want to talk about it. You want something to drink? This is a great house. JIMMY: It belongs to Brian's grandmother. He gets free rent so long as he takes care of the place. That's cool. Yeah, works for me. You don't need that. What. You don't have to be nervous around me. I'm not nervous. Yeah, you are. I'm not! But you've changed. When did you decide to become a riot girl? I don't know. When did you decide to become a slacker? JIMMY: I'm not a slacker. I'm not a riot girl. Well, what's the deal with your lead singer? Suzy? She's my lover. Why? [LAUGHING] She's what? Isn't that what you wanted to know? Well, no. I mean, I just wanted to know what her story was. So. Wow. You left me for her. No, I left you because I was having emotional problems. And then we started the band, and we just-- She seduced you? No one seduced anyone. How did it happen? We were just watching a movie, and we were relaxed, and-- What movie were you watching? Why does that matter? I'm just curious. I remember the first movie I took you to see. Ghost. See, you remember. So you must remember the movie that you and Suzy were watching. OK, OK, it was Snow White. You got all hot and bothered over Snow White? We didn't get all hot and bothered. We just-- you know. JIMMY: Are you in love with her? What? Are you in love with her? I don't know. I don't-- I guess so. That sounds convincing. SHELLY: Do you still have that disco tape I made for you? The one with the version of "Give Me Just a Little More Time" on it? Yeah. (SINGING) Give me, give me, give me just a little more time. Yeah I still got it. (SINGING) Give me just a little more time, and our love will surely grow. Give me-- Hey. I think it's in my closet. I lost mine when I moved. You can borrow mine, if you want to make a copy. You find my address book interesting? Oh. I thought that this was Jimmy's book. I was just going to put my number in it. Hey, Brian. Can I see your phone book? I want to put my number in it. Sure. This is my voicemail number. You can call me here any time and leave a message. How's it going? Well, I guess I'd better go. Do you want me to give you a ride? I don't think that that would be a very good idea. I mean I can drop you nearby. You could walk the rest of the way. OK. Later. This is my zine. "Psychic Roadkill," dedicated to reviewing live political national television. Everything from "This Week with David Brinkley" to "The McLaughlin Group" to "Nightline." I review not only the content, but the performances. And did you know that over 60% of Ted Koppel's male guests wear rugs? I'm not sure why this is, but I think it has something to do with the fact that Ted himself has like a like a small animal on top of his own noggin, right? I mean it. If he wasn't wearing a rug, he'd look like Telly Savala's twin brother. So maybe this is why bald people feel more comfortable on his show. The other thing about Ted is he's got this huge pumpkin head on top of these little tiny shoulders, right? So despite all these physical irregularities, he's a huge TV star. Makes a ton of dough. And I've heard he gets more action the most rock stars. "Psychic Roadkill." Send six bucks, two stamps-- send six stamps, two bucks, and I also take submissions. This is it. Sorry. Call me. I will. Hey, there. How you doing? SHELLY: Good, how are you? [BELCH] Ugh. Oh. - You're done. [GROANING] Yes. Oh, thank you. SHELLY: Here, I got something to show you. SUZY: What is it? Here. It's that guy Dale's work number. Down in L.A. I thought that maybe we could call him and get the address, and write to them or something. Where'd you get this? I-- How did you get his work number? Here, let me help you. Shelly. You went to see Jimmy, didn't you? I had to. I had to find out where Dale was. I don't want what happened to me to happen to anyone else. - Makes sense. - That's bullshit. Shelly, why are you doing this? Come on, Suzy, chill out. Have a little trust. Fine. But I don't like it. I don't want you to see him, OK? Yeah, all right whatever. OK. Computronics. That's cool. Dear sir, it has come to our attention that one of your employees, Dale Edmonds, has been charged with rape. [KNOCKING] SHELLY: Hi. So what's up? Suzy and I were sexing last night, and it was really great. I came like four times. And you, you came all the way over here to tell me that? No. I kept thinking of you when Suzy was making love to me. I kept seeing your face. I tried not to, but I couldn't help it. So, you were with her, but you were thinking about me? That's kind of cool. No, it's not. Suzy loves me. God, why do you drink this shit? Horrible. There's puzzles on the inside of the cap. I never knew that. So what did you do? When? JIMMY: Last night. With Suzy. Everything, why? I've just always been interested. I mean, what's it like? It's just like with you, only different. Did you 69? What? JIMMY: I'm just curious. I remember how much I used to enjoy that, and since I was kind of involved-- SHELLY: Yeah, we did. Now can we talk about what I'm going to do? I don't understand. Why-- why don't you just leave her? I can't. Well, you said you didn't love her. I know. But if I leave her, it will fuck up the band and everything that we've worked for. We just made a demo tape, and we've got some interest from record labels. I didn't know that. God, this sucks. And it's all because of your friend. How's that? If he hadn't come back into town, then Suzy would never have beat him up, and I wouldn't have talked to you. That's kind of a reach. OK. If he had not raped me, then I wouldn't have broken up with you, and I wouldn't have gotten together with Suzy, and I wouldn't be confused now. But either way it's his fault. JIMMY: I guess it is. I just-- I just wish you could have told me what happened. Because then we could have worked it out. I know we could have. Yeah, we could have. [LAUGHING] [MUSIC PLAYING] (SINGING) Give me just a little more time, and our love will surely grow. Give me just a little more time, and our love will surely grow. Life's too short to make a mistake. Let's think of each other and hesitate. Young and impatient, we may be. There's no need to act foolishly. If we part our hearts won't forget it, year from now, we'll surely regret it. Give me just a little more time, and our love will surely grow. Give me just a little more time, and our love will surely grow. Oh, shit! You fucked him, didn't you? Don't lie to me. Ugh, I can smell his man stink on you. Get out of here. Get the fuck out of here, now! Both of you! How could you do this? Come on. It's going to be OK. Who should I kill? Him or her or both? How about neither? Why not? Please, you can't be serious. Why not? Because you threw her out, remember? No, I mean what about the band. We have a gig next week. Things were just starting to happen. Get another guitar player. Howard plays guitar-- I don't want another guitar player. I want-- I want Shelly. She and I started the band together. Yeah, well, maybe that's why you shouldn't have started getting it on with each other. You don't get it, do you? You just don't get it. What's she doing here? Good to see you, too. I'm serious. What's she doing here? She's going to be staying with me for a little while. I'm going to go to the bedroom. What the fuck is your problem? Dale called me today. JIMMY: And? And, he lost his job. Why? Because someone wrote a letter to his boss, and said he was a rapist. And the letter had a Seattle postmark. And you think Shelly had something to do with it? I know she did. I caught her going through my address book last week, and this week his boss gets a letter. It's not too hard to figure out what happened. Well, that doesn't mean that Shelly did it. No? Maybe one of her little carpet munching friends did. But Shelly's responsible. We have a problem here, don't we? BRIAN: Yeah, we do. It's only $50 a month. We get complete kitchen privileges. It's got a cable hookup. Pretty cool, huh? This sucks. It's only temporary. So, you kids making yourselves at home? Yeah. She doesn't look all that happy about it. She'll be fine. How about the band? They're supposed to do a show for me. Well, you're going to have to talk to them. Suzy threw Shelly out of the band. You know it's not a good thing if the band breaks up. I've got record company people calling, they want to get on the guest list. They're going to-- Look. Don't tell Shelly about that, OK? It'll just make her more upset. OK. [MUSIC PLAYING] I know you're a guy, but can't you count? Sorry. Lighten up, Suzy, it's only his second try at this. I know, it's only his second practice. But we have a gig next week. ZOE: We used to do shows without practicing at all. Yeah, we used to suck. People liked us anyway. OK, let's try it again. OK. 1, 2, 3, 4. [TV PLAYING] Hey. I've got an idea. Why don't I go to the store, and get us a nice couple of steaks. You still like to eat steak, don't you? Yeah. I still like steak. Great. I'll go to the store. I'm get us a couple of steaks, and maybe a couple of nice potatoes. Maybe a nice bottle of wine. Don't get wine. Get some beer. OK. OK. I'll be right back. [RADIO PLAYING] I thought you were buying steaks. I had a better idea. Let's go out. Thank you. Anything else I can get you? No, thank you. You still like steak, don't you? You already asked me that. Right. I was just remembering how much you used to like coming here. Look. I know things are rough right now. I just want to make you happy. I'm doing the best I can. I really am. I know. [SOBBING] Hey. Hey, you don't have to cry. It'll be fine. See? [SOBBING] It's fine. See? It's not fine! All right. What's the matter. Haven't you ever seen anyone throw a steak before? Isn't there anything I can do to make you happy? Masturbate for me. What? I want you to jerk off for me. [LAUGHING] What? I'm serious. You asked me if there was anything you could do to make me happy. I-- all right. [SIGHING] You want to help? No. [BREATHING HARD] Yeah, just like that. JIMMY: (WHISPERING) Shit. [BREATHING HARD] [GRUNTING] [GROANING] I'll get you a towel. [MUSIC PLAYING] Thanks. Hey! GIRL: Fuck you and your friend Dale. (SINGING) Send her the pop up books, daisies and candy canes. It's all she wants. Make her a birthday card, hand painted boxing gloves. Make her laugh. And these are things the things you do when you're poor. It's about time you go home. JIMMY: I had a problem with my zines. Had to remake them. Oh, yeah? Which means I'm not going to have my half of the rent for another week or two. That's OK, I think I can cover your $25 for now. Come on, I want to go dancing. [INTERPOSING VOICES] You sure that's a good idea? I mean what if we run into Suzy? [INTERPOSING VOICES] And what if we do? Whoa. Hello, Shelly. Hello. So you know that on Friday, labels are coming to look at us. No, I didn't know that. Really? That's funny, because you guys live with Big Phil. So? Well, he's the one that told us. I mean, I'm sure he would have told you, or at least he would have told Jimmy. Jimmy? Why are you doing this? First you throw Shelly out of your house, then you throw her out your band, and now you think you can just come down here and push her around? Get your fucking hands of me. Fucking what's the matter with you? You know I always thought you had your shit together, but now you go around acting like the people that you say you hate. Come on. Let's just go. You're lucky I don't hit girls. Oh, I'm really afraid. What's up? Hey, Shelly. I'm really sorry about last night. You and Suzy? No. Not about that. About not telling you about the gig. Wasn't right. I don't know what's happened to me. Where are you going? Going to get a job. - What? - I'll be home for dinner. Love you. Love you, too. I can't believe I'm on the campus. I keep thinking about the movie "The Graduate." Maybe the Dustin Hoffman character is completely beside the point. What about the Elaine character? The one that was played by Katherine Ross. She made me so mad. She was this good student at Berkeley, of all places, and she completely compromises herself. She's not in love with either the men that she's with, and she marries one of them, and then she runs off with the guy who fucked her mother. What's up with that? Where you been? I just wanted to make sure that you came by yourself. Please. The last thing I want to do is join the Suzy and Shelly drama club. So what's up? I just would-- I would-- you've always seemed so even keeled. And I was just wondering if you would tell me what I should do. About what? About the fact that you treat people like dirt? I don't treat people like dirt. I know, I'm sorry. About the fact that you treat people who love you like dirt? That's not fair. ZOE: Yeah, it is Shelly. You seduce people and then you run away. I didn't run away. Yeah, you did. I didn't mean to. I just-- I get so confused. What? Scared? Oh, come on Shelly. I got to go. [MUSIC PLAYING] (SINGING) Isn't it funny now it has ended. Let's be good friends now. Least let's pretend it. I don't want to lie about it, I don't want to lie about it, I don't want to lie about it. Give it to me. I don't want to lie about it, I don't want to lie about it, I don't want to lie about it. Give it to me. Surprised to see you in this part of town. I'm sure. So what's the special occasion? I want back in the band. That was something special. Yeah, well. That's why I never understood why a guy had to come in between us. I didn't mean for it to happen, it just did. And so what do you want to do now? I want to move back in the house, and I want us to have a platonic relationship. I'm not sure that's going to work. SHELLY: You always said that the cause came first. Here's your chance to prove it. What about your boyfriend. No, I'm not going to be seeing anyone. And I don't want anyone bothering him. SUZY: Nobody's going to be bothering him. So when do you want to move back in? Tomorrow. Well, why not tonight? I mean we have a gig on Friday, we have to practice and everything. SHELLY: I need some time to pack. OK. So I'll see you tomorrow. I'll see you tomorrow. What's up? I'm moving back in with the band. You're going back to Suzy? SHELLY: I'm not going back to Suzy. I'm moving back in with the band. You know that we've got record labels that are interested in us. We need to practice more, and me and Suzy have decided to have a platonic relationship. What about us? You weren't even going to tell me, were you? You were just going to split, without saying a word. You lied to me. How could you do that? I'm not leaving until tomorrow. I figured we could have one last night together. Oh, how fun. Sort of like playing the last game of shuffleboard on the Titanic. I could leave earlier, if you'd like. JIMMY: I don't believe this. I went out and I got a job today, so you and I could have some more money. I didn't ask you to do that. How fun. I'm doing this as much for you as I am for me. JIMMY: Jesus, I should have listened to Brian. You know he said she's trouble. Would I listen? No. You need someone sweet and sensitive, not someone like me who doesn't know what she wants. JIMMY: No, stupid, idealistic Jimmy. I'm just moving back into the house. Maybe if I just lover, just a little bit more. SHELLY: So it will make it easier to practice. I would think that you, out of all people would know why I want to get to get my music out there. JIMMY: You know what really pisses me off was the way that you used sex as a weapon. Dammit! Why did I have fall in love with you? [MUSIC PLAYING] (SINGING) Think what went wrong. Think of what's far from the rooftops. And the downtown lights made me cry. And the downtown lights made me cry. With outstretched arms up above the rainy weather. What are you doing? Just lay back and enjoy yourself. (SINGING) And the downtown lights made me cry. SHELLY: Let's jam, we got to get going Friday. [MUSIC PLAYING] (SINGING) Sometimes when I think of you and when I plan the things that I want you to do. Take my mind, I don't need it this time. I want to be just like you. Whoa, ho! Cover me. Strip down, I want to see you exposed. Defenceless, victim of the pleasure about to explode. Take my mind, I don't need it this time. I want to be just like you. Whoa, ho! Cover me. Whoa, ho, cover me. Whoa ho, use me. Whoa ho, cover, whoa ho, lover, whoa ho, let's fuck. What do you want? I heard Shelly moved back in with her girlfriend. So I thought I'd come by see, how you're holding up. I'm doing fine. What's up with the monkey suit? I got a job. BRIAN: Where? Microsoft. No way. It's actually a really cool place to work. Man, you must have took her leaving really hard, didn't you? Still doing my zine. I got a call from Dale's mom last night. He got arrested down in L.A. He raped some girl he was working with down there. Look, I-- I'm really sorry I treated you guys so badly. It's just-- JIMMY: I told them Shelly I wouldn't lie. No one wanted to listen to me. It's really hard to admit your friends are fucked up. I know. Doesn't really matter, though. What do you mean? You and Shelly should be together. And you would be if people would've helped you out. If I would've helped you out. JIMMY: Hey. She wanted to stay with the band. Well, I'm going to go down and see them tonight. I'm going to try and apologize to her. I came by to see if you wanted to go, too. I don't think so. Come on, I know you want to see her play. MAN: Yeah, it's really cool-- JIMMY: I don't know about this. BRIAN: Come on, there hasn't made a big buzz in this town since grunge was around. JIMMY: Yeah, but I never lived with Chris Cornell. You always wanted to. Come on, man, with all these people in here nobody's even going to know you're here. [MUSIC PLAYING] BOB: Hey. Bob Duncan. Sideburg Records. Donna's record company. Oh, hi. I'm Suzy. Nice to meet you. Well. I just want to say, I've heard a lot about you guys. I'm really looking forward to seeing you. Donna is very interested in you guys. She and I both think this punk thing is going to be really big. Oh, yeah. Well, I mean it's like how rock and roll was meant to be. Chaotic, edgy. Dangerous. Well, I'm just going to-- I'll leave you guys alone so you can-- good luck. OK. Oh, hiya. [INAUDIBLE] Thanks. Just go talk to them, OK? All right, calm down. I'll talk to them. What's up? Those girls from the zine table, they want me to ask you guys to leave. What did you tell them? I told you there wasn't anything I could do, but they didn't seem to care for my answer. They're going to complain to Suzy. Maybe we should just go. Normally, I don't tell you guys how to behave. But if you leave now, you're never going to show your face in this town again. Yeah. Yeah, Jimmy, it's matter of principle. Besides, I don't think they're going to get a chance to talk to Suzy until after the show. [CHEERING] There are two guys in the audience that need to leave. They know who they are. And the show isn't going to start until they're out of here. GIRL: Let's hear some music. Get off the stage. We're not getting off this stage until these enemies to the cause are forced to leave. God, they should just leave. What the hell's going on? Ask Shelly. What are you talking about? It's your boyfriend and his loser friend. I didn't know they were coming. Shut up and play. Get off the stage. Get them off the damn stage. Why don't you talk to Shelly? Why don't to ask her to make them leave. I got a better idea. Why don't we just play? You know what? This is fucked. Don't leave. Make the guys leave. Shit. Let's go. Get off the stage. GIRL: That's right, make them leave. BOY: Fuck you, play. [GUITAR PLAYING] Let's go. They're not going to accept your apology. You can do whatever you want, Jimmy. I'm not leaving. Big Phil. What do you want me do? (SINGING) When I think of you. BOY: Sing it, girl. [INAUDIBLE] of the things that I want you to do. BOY: Throw her off the stage. Who threw that? SHELLY: Take my mind, I don't need it this time, I want to be just like you. Don't throw things at them. Fuck you. Whoa ho. Cover me. Bastard. (SINGING) Strip down. I want to see you exposed. Defenseless, victim of the pleasure about explode. Take my mind, I don't need it this time. I want to be just like you. Lay down. Whoa ho. Cover me. [INTERPOSING VOICES] Chaotic. Edgy. Dangerous. (SINGING) Whoa ho, cover me. Whoa ho, use me. Whoa, cover, whoa, lover, whoa, let's fuck. Thanks for coming out. [CRASHING] SHELLY: (SINGING) Whoa ho, cover me. Whoa, ho, use me. Whoa, ho, cover, whoa, lover, whoa let's fuck. [LAUGHING] Oh, shit. Morning. Morning. I've decided to move to D.C. What's going on? Suzy's moving to D.C. How come? I've been thinking about it for a while. I mean I like being in the band. You know? I always thought it was a way to make a statement. But I think I can make more of a statement by being an activist. I think it came to a head last night, because I don't really think a riot like that does very much for the cause. So. The time is right for me, now. I'm more of an activist, and you guys are a band. I don't know if this is the right time to bring it up, but the guy offered us a deal last night. It's true. It made have been bad for you last night, but it only helped us. He said it gave us real punk rock credentials. Suzy? I think you guys will make a great trio. Oh, they return to the scene of the crime. Hey, come on. It wasn't our fault. Sorry we didn't get here sooner. Listen, I'm not mad at you guys, if that's what you think. That was the insurance guy. He's giving the club owner $3,000 for damages. He's given me $4,000 for PA system. [LAUGHING] How can he give you four grand for-- I mean that PA sucked. Hey, ding dong, I didn't say it was worth four grand, I said he was giving me four grand. I'm taking that on a long vacation. When I get back, I'm selling the store. You're going to sell the store? No way. What's with the guy, Jimmy? You can't do this. We need you. There's a lot of us who can't go shopping at the warehouse. I know. Who's going to promote the cool shows? And who's going to sell zines, and vinyl, and all of those-- [KEYS JINGLING] Take it easy, guys. He gave me the keys. PA SYSTEM: [INAUDIBLE] for final boarding call. Flight number 87, service to Anchorage. All passengers intending travel on this flight should be on board through the door marked C9. - I'm going to miss you. - I'll miss the music. [MUSIC PLAYING] (SINGING) Somehow it all got turned around once again. In the dark I might lose in the end. Sometimes the truth is all you get. There's a man on the street, he was wearing only one shoe I bought him doughnuts and wine, he wanted my change, too. Excuse me. Do work for a congressman, Allen Palmak? Yes, I do. You know his voting record on women's issues sucks. But I had no idea what happened two months ago in that election, because first of all the bill that was introduced had nothing to do with-- (SINGING) Sometimes the truth is all you get. Sometimes the truth is all you get. So. You going to go see her tonight? I have to. I'm sponsoring the show. Oh. (SINGING) I know an old man who's got some deep rich dreams. I've been thinking a lot about this woman named Ani DeFranco. She pulls together exactly what I want to pull together in my music. It's like a mix between politics, empowerment of women, and really, really good music. She blew me away. I saw her at Bumbershoot this summer. She was amazing. She's owed her own record company for like seven years, or something. All these major record labels have tried to get her to join up with them, but she won't do it. She doesn't want to sell out like that. And I think that that's really honorable. She's really cute too. I'd like to fuck her. Sometimes the truth is all you get. [MUSIC PLAYING] (SINGING) Buildings and bridges are made to bend in the wind. To withstand the world, that's what it takes. All that steel and stone are no match for the air, my friend. What doesn't bend breaks. What doesn't bend breaks. [VOCALIZING] [VOCALIZING] We are made to bleed, and scab and heal and bleed again. And turn every scar into a joke. We are made to fight, and fuck and talk and fight again, and sit around and laugh until we choke. Sit around and laugh until we choke. [VOCALIZING] Don't know who you were expecting. Probably some bitch who does not budge, with eyes the size of snow. I may get pissed off sometimes, but you seem like the type to hold a grudge, and in the end I just let it go. In the end I just let it go. [VOCALIZING] Buildings and bridges are made bend in the wind. To withstand the world, that's what it takes. All that steel and stone are no match for the air, my friend. What doesn't bend breaks. What doesn't bend breaks. What doesn't bend breaks. [VOCALIZING]
