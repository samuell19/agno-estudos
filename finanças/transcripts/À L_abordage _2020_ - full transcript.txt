ALL HANDS ON DECK Shit, my train! - You ok? - Yeah. Sorry, we don't have time. My train is in an hour. Does she have pretty hair? Beautiful. Nice teeth? She has big cheeks. - Big cheeks? - Yes. That's nice. It's because she's young. Mind if I help? Not at all. Sometimes you don't want help because you walk well. Thank you. You're welcome. - Do you want your pills? - Please. It's a very good idea or a very bad one. Ok, but do you think it's worth risking it or not? You have to take risks. Or you do nothing and that's terrible. So I go for it? I go for it. - It's best to do it. - Yes. It's best to do it. It's either good or lousy. It could be good. Exactly. And if it's lousy, then you'll know. But you have to go. There. Where is it? Between Montélimar... Montélimar and Valence. I see. I know that part of France. That's nice. Is she with her family? Yes, she is. But I won't be with her family. I'll be at a... I won't stay with them. No, certainly not. It's not right. You have a hotel, or a room? Exactly. Do you think she'll be pleased to see you? That's the question. I hope so. - What? - I hope so. That means you think she will be. Yes. I think so. Félix! Sorry to drop by but we're taking off. Yes, I heard. There are a lot of trips on now. Mountains, sea... We're short on gear. We'll take anything. Two tents would be great. We're two big guys. And my buddy snores. Understand? It'll give us privacy. Naked in the river Come in. Can I help you? It's my grandmother. She wants a discount card? No, she lives back in Africa. Well, lived. Spit it out. My grandmother's really sick. She's dead. Sick or dead? Dead. When? Last night or this morning, I'm not sure. The time difference. You want time off? To go see your family? That'd be good. Five days, say? Maybe a week's better. A week... Take a week. Thanks, boss. But when your grandma really dies, Chérif, don't bother asking. When your exams start and you want flexible hours, remember to ask nicely. Knock on the window. Edouard? Sorry we're late. What? Who are you? Your carpool. I expected girls, Felicia and Cherifa. That's us. What? I don't like being fooled. What is this? We used a girlfriend's account. We take the same space. Sorry, it's not the same thing. You carpool to pick up girls? What? Bullshit. Hold on, this wasn't planned. I could report you for using a fake profile. Could you stop eating? You'll dirty the seats. Hi, Mom. Hello, kitten. Everything ok? Can I call you in five minutes? - Drive safely. - Yes, Mom. Watch your speed. I'm sunbathing by the pool. The crickets are chirping. - What's that? - Nothing. Is someone with you? Mom, can I call you later? You got my curtains? They're in the trunk. You darling. I can't talk, I'm driving. Call me later. Lots of love. Love you, kitten. Carpooling without telling Mommy, kitten? Naughty boy. I can leave you at the next rest stop. The kitten has claws! That breeze feels good. Nothing like the wind in Paris, huh? It's from someplace else. - Get it? - You're off... Can't wait to get there. We'll get there and then what? I turn up, I go see her... She'll be shocked. "He's here?" She'll be shocked. Totally shocked. First thing you do in a town like that, you go to the river. See what I mean? We'll get to the river around 7 or 8 pm. We'll have it to ourselves. We'll go for a swim... Naked, of course. We'll make love like Mohicans. Shouldn't you tell her you're coming? My big idea is to surprise her, ok. She's been on my mind since that night in the park. I'd tell you about it, but with kiddo here, I can't go into detail. If I'm bothering you, say so. You've got a nerve. You arrive late, lie... I'm not your chauffeur. You talk like I'm not here. He's pissed. Yeah, I'm pissed! On a ride-share, you're friendly, take an interest in others... You can join in, kitten. No worries. You overheard our conversation. Surprise or not? No idea, I don't know her. You don't need to. He only knows his mom. You can't say without that? Have you got a photo? Smart guy, he wants her data! Hold on, he needs a photo too. I'll show him a real woman. Look. What do you say? He's flatlining! The guy's st-stuttering! He can't speak. She's pretty. We know that. But she looks feisty. The guy sees. He senses photos. Yeah, give her a surprise. We agree. She's worth the risk. Hear that? Check out the wild scenery. Unbelievable! The foliage, the pebbles, river and mountains too. It's a total paradise. I said it'd be paradise. It's not bad. It's so pretty! Don't we go through town to the campsite? My GPS is telling me straight on. Can't we check the town out before we go there? A 30-km detour and you want the dude to give us a tour? For his culture. Maybe there are sights here Kitten doesn't know. Every town's the same here. I'll be late. No, this is Alma's town, not some... - Jesus... - What's wrong? It's not just any town. Hope to spot her? No, it's not that. But there may be some nice things to see. I suggest... Kitten, try turning here. It's narrow. You can pass. You're not driving. - Fuck... - Yeah. Why am I here? I can show you the town but this sucks. You're a bit close. Watch out. To the right. Pull away a bit. No more detours. To your campsite, and I'm off. There, that's it. Ok? More to the left. Shit! What was that? Take a look. Looks like it's broken. The camp mechanics? We don't know. We arrived today. Is it serious? What? We can't move, the wheel's jammed. It's jammed and makes a noise. You ok, man? Mom's so stressed she'll freak out. What, bro? My mom'll freak out. You piss me off, making me enter that dumb village. I fucked up cos of you two jerks. Shit... What a dumb idea! Just so he can find his bitch. - Screw that. - Learn to drive, pal. What was that? He didn't say anything. Chill, ok. The repairs will cost him a bomb. Apologize at least. Are you serious? You heard the guy speak to me. He's filthy rich. You heard his mom. "The pool with the crickets..." Ok, but it's not done, bro. I just don't like that guy. It's something about his face. It's true, he has a face like... I dunno. A choirboy's face, that's it! I hate it. I swear. I can't let that by, bro. Look at this beautiful river! Spare me the other crap. Brought your white boy shirts? What's this? Basic? You wanna diss me? My girl's from Paris 14, bro. Right by Montsouris Park. Get it? I can't turn up looking like a bum. I have to look good. What's up with my shirt? C'mon, man, don't turn into an Oreo. It soon happens. You think I'm like that? You're nuts. No worries, I know who I am. It's crazy when you want to up your game... See what I mean? ...you have to adapt. I can't stay a hick forever. Feels so good! Yes, he's in my class. He's invited me to stop over at his parents' place in Die. I thought we could go cycling together. We could go cycling together... There are some good passes to climb. Fuck! I just tripped. I'm fine. No, it's ok. Another guy in my year. An Irish exchange student. - Félix? - How are you? How's it going? Sorry, I can't talk now, I'm eating. Not even for a minute? Just a second, let me move. Ok, I'm in the living room. We're eating on the patio as the sun sets behind the mountains. It's been crazy hot today. We had to spend all day in the river. Great, I went for a dip too. Really? Where? - At the pool? - No, guess. I don't know. In a river. A river? Which one? Hold on, I'll send you a photo. Got it? Hold on, I don't get it. Where are you? Not in Paris? No, I wanted a vacation too. Surely you're not here? - I am. - Hold on... When did you get here? An hour ago. But... You just turn up at my place? Not your place, the river. C'mon, don't split hairs, you know what I mean. It's a surprise. Can't you see how freaky this is? I just wanted to surprise you, Alma. I mean, I've come 600 km to see you. You shouldn't have, ok. You could've let me know. What do I do now? I dunno... The viaduct café... Meet me there tomorrow at 5 pm. Bye. I see her tomorrow. Tomorrow? Why not tonight? She had to stay at home tonight. Her folks are having friends over. But that's ok. That way, I can rest a bit. She liked the surprise? Why wouldn't she like it? If your girl crosses France to see you, you're happy, right? Yes. So she liked it. Edouard's taking his car to the garage in the morning. We talked it over and he could come camp with us. I'll let him have my tent. I need to be in shape tomorrow. You'll snore and I'll have a bad night. That'll teach me to help such selfish louts. We're louts now? Cos we're not scouts or preppies, kitten? Stop calling me kitten! What's up, man? Chill. Watch the words you use too. Something stinks. Maybe my feet. Sorry. Smell this. I think it's this. It stinks of piss. Yeah, it's piss. The youth club kids, pissing their beds crying for their moms. Seriously... How can I sleep in this? Think it's funny? I can lend you another of my mom's curtains. Ok. Shit, we're sleeping in curtains. 100 euros, all included, I should've realized. Look at this. Jesus... Good night. Thanks, you too. You know, bro... Don't be mad at Félix. He may seem blunt but he's a decent guy deep down. The sensitive type. I've never seen him like he is over this girl. I understand. Yeah. Good night. Don't hesitate... to wake me. I'll try not to snore, ok. Wake me if I do. Don't worry. I snore a bit too. Yeah? Girls have told me. Good night. Good night. Is it bad? Not totally bad. The hub's twisted. It houses the wheel bearings. As it's all off kilter, the wheel struggles. It's not straight. I have to change it. How long will it take? Well, it takes... it takes time. We order the parts, wait for them, then change it. That'll take a while. Meaning? A good week or so. What? A week? The parts, see. I don't live around here. It's my mom's car too. So call your mom and tell her the car's stuck here. I called her, but the thing is I have to be discreet. Discreet cos Mom doesn't know the car's here? Yes. Ok, I get it. But we can't do it faster. We can't. A good week. You have to wait. Make the most of it. Hike, go canoeing... There's plenty to do. Hello. Be right back. Want it? Take it? You rascal. Here I am! You can't see. What is it? Hungry? We'll eat soon. Nearly done. - A little girl? - Yes. What's her name? Nina. Beautiful eyes. Thanks. - She loves that. - Dropping stuff. She's seen how... If she plays, she likes you. Me too. Ok there? - Got any kids? - No. She put it on her foot. That's two rings. Very bling-bling. Hi. We were at the river. My sister, Lucie. Delighted. Félix. I'll be going. I have to make a phone call and shop for dinner. Call me to head back with me. Bye. See you later. I'll park my bike. Go ahead. - Ok? - Fine, and you. I'm good. You had coffee? It's really hot. Still, it's up to you. What'll I have? A Perrier might be good. I don't like this café. It's not so bad. There's a nice view. It's on a bridge, people pass, there's a breeze... I know the view by heart. Sorry about yesterday. I reacted weirdly. But I really hate surprises. I really do. My mom arranged a surprise party once. I began crying and locked myself in the bathroom. You're here now. That has to be a good sign. How's the campsite? It's ok. Their karaoke evenings are pretty cool. I go with my sister. Been coming here long? Yeah, a while now. My folks got the house when I was six. So you had your first summer romance here? Mind your own business. Feel like going for a walk? Cafés are so Parisian. That's a nice spot. Ok, wait there while I go change. Turn around. Go on in. I have to put sunscreen on cos of my acne treatment. Why? Your skin's beautiful. It was nothing like this a few months back. I bet you were still beautiful with pimples everywhere. Stop, that's gross. I can rub it in. Dream on. Ok. Chérif! Check this out. What's up? He's good. I'm surprised it worked. Make her laugh and you're in. Beautiful. Like a dream. Got a girl? No. You? Not right now. You just broke up? No. Onto one? No. Well... Not exactly. You're a washout too. That's a bit strong. You're a washout, man. Yeah, I'm a washout. See that? Play with the joystick tonight! Hit her bull's-eye! Kévin! Sofiane! Watch it! It's not very private. I'm getting cold. We're good here. I'm cold. Come back. Let go. Come on. Jesus! What? I really hurt my foot. Fuck it. - Really hurt? - Yes, really. Shit. Let me see. The river isn't clean, it's full of bacteria. Only Dutch tourists go there. Do the sewers empty into it? People say that. Come to the pool. You're safe with the chlorine we use. I can save you if you drown. I'll do it, ok, I'm a nurse. No can do, buddy. - I'm not your buddy. - Calm down. Ok... I'll wrap it before it gets to a duel. I feel weird. Can you get me a drink? I'll look after her. I'll see you around, wise guy. He's the cranky type. Yeah. I'm Martin. And you? Alma. Alma? That means, "one with cool saliva." Know that? No. That's not right. It is. An Alma in Morocco told me. Been to Morocco? Yeah. What did you do there? I hitched from Fes to Essaouira to surf on the Atlantic coast. Hold this for me. Thanks. Great, you surf. Yeah. Can you stop here? Thanks, it's not far now. My parents don't know, so I'll leave you here. Can I see your house? That's it, with the blue shutters. I'm not their type? What? You're way wrong. My parents are very open. If they're very open, fine. What's your problem? Go back to the campsite. Aren't you sick of ordering me around, princess? You send me to get a drink while that clown was kissing your feet. Kissing my feet? Doing a dressing is kissing my feet? You need help. I'm going. - Wait. - Let go. Listen to me first. Let go. I hate blackmail. Ok, sorry. First you cut my foot, now you break my arm? I'm sorry I hurt you and I'm sorry I got mad. Ok? Let me hug you. That's not how it works. I don't want you touching me right now. See you tomorrow? No, I'm hiking with my family. Maybe tomorrow evening. If I'm not too tired. I'll call you. Bye. Excuse me. Bro... Tabbouleh? Not my thing. It fills you up. Get it if you want. We share. Veggies are out with you. Ever tried canyoning? What's that? You descend a canyon. I did it in Corsica. It's a lot of fun. In the water? No way with my ears. Yeah? - Félix. - Not why I'm here. Those bastards are marketing wizards. Look at the packaging, it looks homemade. What are they? Favas? Some kind of beans. Good thing I got the melon. Shit... I got good grades in college. My profs wanted me to apply to business school, but the truth is... Even with a scholarship, I never would've gone. It's for rich kids. Do you realize, they're taught to sell fancy-looking junk to poor people, it's... It's crazy. They'd never buy it. They know what's in it. Well... Rich kids... I dunno, business schools... The application process is... selective. It's not just rich kids. Guys, I think I'm going to turn in. See you tomorrow, bro. Good night, Félix. Sorry... I forgot my sunblock. Cycling's never boring. Everything changes: the scenery, the wind... the rain. It's an adventure in the mountains. When you climb a pass... It's an inner struggle, a personal challenge. When you reach the top, you're drained, but happy. You feel powerful. So, kitten? What are you doing here? Don't be a wise guy! You'll top out. That's a mistake. Yeah, right. See you at the top. Kitten! Been here long? 10 minutes. Oh really? Those beans gave me indigestion. Chérif snores, it's... I didn't sleep either. It's beautiful. Magnificent. Feel that breeze? That high-altitude breeze. Feels good, doesn't it? It brings back so many memories. So what do I have to do? Nothing. Make sure she stays on the sheet, and doesn't eat anything. That's it. She's quick. I see that. She's attacking my glasses. I can't let her... Holler if you need me, ok? I will. No! Denied. See you in a sec. Ok. You're going to turn into a pretty little girl. Like your mommy. You better be nice to washouts like me. You seem alright. You have a good heart. You'll do alright. Yeah, I know. Wait... Look at Mommy. Look. It's Mommy. Say hi. Mommy's about to go splash. A little splash... Not a big splash like me, but a pretty little splash. In the water. Look, she's waving. Can you wave? And... splash! Look at Mommy swimming. Did you finish it? Did you? How'd it go? Great. How'd it go, my love? We clicked, right Nina? I see that. Anyway, thank you. It was really nice. Aren't you going in? I can't, with my ear infection. Ear infections like kids? Yes. I better get going. Stay with us a while. Unless you'd rather read your book. I'd understand. I don't want to impose. You're not imposing. He had to leave because of an emergency at the restaurant he's renovating back home in Lille. He was supposed to return in 2 days, and now, with the complications, it's been... 5 days that I've been alone with Nina. There. But we're just fine. It's nice here. We're having fun. Vacation has never been my thing. Really? No. As a kid, my friends from the projects would go to camp on the coast. - Summer camp? - Yeah. My thing was more... A basketball hoop and a computer, and I was happy. Where'd you live? La Courneuve. No way! I used to live in Stains! - Seriously? - Yes. - It's near... - Next door! We're neighbors. There's the Carrefour! The Carrefour with the mall! There was a Star Food, know it? At the entrance. I used to go there all the time. The food was so good. It was amazing. Is it still open? I think they closed. It's been a while. That's too bad. Ok. Yeah, I lived there till I was 14, and then my parents decided it was too dangerous, so we moved to Lille. But all my friends were in Stains. That's wild. Stop obsessing and drop your phone. I'm not obsessing. She could at least text me. Maybe the girl's having dinner. Leave her alone, she's with her parents. But we're having dinner, and I'm checking my messages. It takes what, 2 seconds? She's busy, you're busy. Period. Who cares? I didn't see him. Don't worry, at some point we'll beat the shit out of him. - Yeah? - He's asking for it. It's true, cocky surfer types really get on my nerves. I say hang his dog before we go. You're hardcore! He's dangerous. Not the dog! Golden retrievers are so sweet. Don't punish the animal for the human's mistakes. Drop your phone. Enough! Let her come to you. What if she doesn't? Women are... It's not easy, but you have to play hard to get. If you're too available, it doesn't work. Women don't like lapdogs. Yeah, they must prefer kittens. No, for real. I should've been born a kitten, instead of a lapdog. That's funny. Stop calling me! If I don't answer, I'm busy. Félix, I'm going to bed. I'm in pajamas. Yes, it's bedtime. Alma, how can you talk to him that way? Nobody asked you. After everything the guy did for you? I never asked. Maybe you led him on. Not at all! Yesterday, I saw him even though I didn't want to. Careful Alma, you'll be older one day, and if you keep being cruel, you'll turn into an old witch. Know what? You're projecting your fears on me. I'm 22. That won't be for a long time. Anyway longer than you. Thanks for the cone. You're welcome, my pleasure. Is it good? Can I taste? Here. Hold on. Sure. Vanilla. Classic. Attack! Attack! Attack! She's funny. Don't spit it out at us! Why would I spit it out? It doesn't look very good. Where's the dog? Right over there. On the terrace? He's not going to come inside? He does sometimes, but I don't think he will now. - Is he holding him? - Yeah, he's got him. Don't worry. What is that? Breath spray? I wish. No, it's not that. It's for anxiety. What anxiety? Let's just say that, if I have a kid someday, which will never happen, he'll see the apocalypse. How can people joke around and have babies with what's in store? When animals disappear, insects... It keeps me up at night. I can't sleep. Yeah. Am I boring you? Not at all. - Tell me. - Not at all, really. You're a tax lawyer? Yeah, so what? I should make him eat you. That's disgusting. Given the choice, I'd rather you did it. - Who bites me. - I'm afraid it's contagious. It isn't. No. So you're right-wing? That's not good. You help the rich get richer, isn't that the... The heart of the matter? If I'm not mistaken. What do you do? Other than give out good marks and bad marks. A 20th century man. Or even the 19th. Yeah... I do odd jobs, honest work that does no harm. I wash windows, pick fruit, heal feet. You're kind of a lonesome cowboy. - Is that it? - No idea. I bet the girls are into you, the young ones I mean. Yeah. The older ones too. Don't you ever get anxious about all that? Well, I understand, you know... But I figure... You can't think about it every day. You might as well shoot yourself. Sorry, but... Yeah, maybe that's what I'll end up doing. Where's your bathroom? My mom called earlier, I didn't even answer. I'll call her back tomorrow. Your mother's persistent. If you want, Félix and I can intimidate her a little. No? Maybe a little intimidation will... That sounds scary. Just over the phone, it's harmless. No, I'll handle it. Guys, it's Alma! It's her. Alma! Wait! Guys, are you coming? You think it's a good idea to just show up there? Can't you wait till tomorrow? She made fun of me! I need to set her straight tonight. Is making a scene at her window going to fix things? It's past the point of fixing things. Fuck! Don't you think we should grab him? Bro, are you retarded? Alma! I know you're awake. Come down. Shit... Dude, remember your pride. What are you doing? I need her to come down. - Why? - We have to talk. You're too violent. Let it go! Text her, if you want. I won't budge till she comes down! Alma! What are you shouting for? Are you insane? I don't want to see you. Leave now, or I call the police. Call the police. I won't budge. No, dude. You're not gonna get arrested for a girl you saw twice! What if she calls the cops? I don't have ID. Stop worrying. At least have the courage to talk to me! I won't let them take Félix alone. If he goes to jail, I go to jail. Félix. Alma's staying upstairs. I came down because you both seem to be stuck. Dialogue has broken down. I'm for non-violent communication. I think you just need to talk calmly. You have to open up and tell her to be straight with you. Can you promise me I'll talk to her tomorrow? Tomorrow morning, no, because we're going canyoning. She'll call you when we finish. Canyoning? Awesome! Are you going with Drome Adventures? No, with some friends who have a canyoning license. Félix, that's great! We should go with them. We could come with you. A group activity. It's better than a phone call. - Or talking at a café. - Count me out. I get ear infections. Félix, I'll come. It'll be beautiful. We'll all go. You two can talk. There's no guarantee you can come. - What's up? - Hey, there. Is this an ambush? No, we were together yesterday, and we mentioned canyoning and they wanted to come, but I don't know if it's possible. I told them it might not be. Got any experience? Once, yes, in Corsica. And Félix... present here, is a great athlete. He boxes... He biked up Chaudiére Mountain the other day, heroically. I see, I see... Would the injured patient like that? Yeah, yeah. I dunno... Yes. Given so much enthusiasm, I accept with pleasure. Provided the gentleman doesn't throw me off a cliff. There's the hole. Here we are. Feet first. Go for it, kitten! Bravo, kitten! It's awesome! What's wrong, Alma? You don't want to jump? Even Lucie was shouting how fun it was. Please, stop. Félix, please come with me. Let me talk to her. You don't want to try? Come on. Leave me alone! Come on. No. Leave me. You're stressing her. Come with me. I'll take care of her, don't worry. Alma! Stop, you'll just stress her! Alma, are you ok? - Calm down. - No, she's not ok. What are they doing? He's massaging her, the player. Chill. He massages me all the time. It's not sexual. Yeah, right. Even so. It's so annoying. She's being a drama queen... I know her by heart. Alma, get down here! Get down here! Jump! Hey Félix, got any weed? - What? - Weed. Know what? Ask him. He's got lots. - What? - Got any weed? - What? - To smoke. - Weed? - Yes. - For Alma? - No, for me. - I don't understand. - To smoke. - Oh, drugs? - Yes. No, I don't do drugs. - Give me your hand. - No, please! Alma, give me your hand. Look, hold my hand. Take one step, then jump. Just one step. Let go of the side. You've come this far, now go. 1... 2... No! - 2, 3... - No! Count! Count! Alma, a little dignity, please. What? Just get a grip. Thank you. I must be dreaming! What's she doing? Just get naked! Enough, ok? Are we bothering you? You should be ashamed! You're feeling her up in front of everyone! What's up with you? I'll soon cool you down. Feel better now? What are you doing? Let go of him! Are you ok? Asshole! What was that? It's called a smash. Not cool. - Nine. - Fénf. She said fénf-neun. - It's slippery. - Yeah, it is. A little slippery. It's the net. Be right back. For me, this past year, I've put my studies on hold, I've stopped dancing... and for him, it's like nothing's changed. Maybe a restaurant and a baby the same year wasn't a good idea. What kind of restaurant? Neapolitan pizza. Sounds delicious. His great-grandparents were Italian. They came after the war to work in the mines. So it's in his blood. Fuck... I told you, I got mugged in Yucatén. It was the same deal. He put me in an armlock. It hurt for a few days. Because the ligament... gets sprained. There's a little swelling. Anyway, if they amputate... Women love stumps. I saw a guy online with a shark tattoo on his stump. The shark's teeth... Stop, please. Get into alternative sex. Slowly, slowly... Thanks for this lovely day. Nicolas, I'm sorry. - You stay. - What do you mean I stay? After the hospital I buy dinner. I decide who I have dinner with. Don't be prissy, what'd you think? I don't know, we could all go home. I don't sleep around! I didn't say that. I invited you to dinner. Ok, I'm staying. I'm staying and I'll see you tonight or tomorrow. Bye. Félix, wait! Can I talk to you for a minute? I'm listening. I wanted to apologize. I'm really sorry. I don't know what got into me, treating you that way. I was a real bitch. It was a beautiful thing, coming all the way here. I don't think I deserve to be loved like that. There. Now you see my true colors. I don't think you're a bitch. You deserve to be loved. We just weren't meant for each other. That's all. Evening. Hey. - What's up? - Can we talk for a sec? Yeah, let's go. Dude, wait a minute... I understand it's tough, but... If I risked my job, it's not to leave after 3 days. We're here, let's enjoy ourselves. What risk are you talking about? Just say you're staying for the mommy. Are you serious? You babysit for her! You can babysit in Paris. You're wasting your time here, bro. Dude, back up. Not all relationships revolve around sex or love. Some can be selfless. I don't deny it, but you always end up with women who are either taken or married. Anyway, women who are unavailable. Anyone would think you're gay, wake up! If you want to leave, leave. I'm staying. You're abandoning me? Go on, split. Any plans tomorrow? No, none. Do you think you could watch Nina for 2 hours? Or would that be a problem? I heard I can get a great massage in town. And I really need to relax. If you're looking for a nanny, place an ad. I'm on vacation, get it? I get it. - Why are you so upset? - Enough. Chérif? Chérif? For my last night, I'm sleeping by the river. Want my tent? Thanks. It's weak, don't worry. 2 weeks sick leave... calls for celebration. Sorry. It happens. If the camp needs someone to fill in for you, I'm game. To work? Well, yeah. It's not easy. It's August, so the toilet blocks need cleaning 3 times a day. That's ok. I need money to repair my mother's car. I don't know who does the hiring, but I'm motivated, serious, a quick learner. Well, why not. I can't promise anything, but... I'll ask him, yeah. We'll see. She finally fell asleep, I don't want to wake her. You alright? Yeah. I wanted to apologize for earlier. I shouldn't have reacted that way. It's not like me. I had a fight with my friend, and I took it out on you. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have. I'm the one who's sorry. I've been taking up your time, pestering you with my problems. It was a lot to ask. You didn't pester me. I had zero expectations for this trip. I don't even know why I came, and... I've really enjoyed spending time with you and Nina. It made me feel important. Really. We really enjoyed it too. But it's not over, you're not leaving? I am, actually. That's why I came by... to clear the air. That's sad. We're going to miss you. I was thinking... Since it's my last night... We could get a drink at the snack bar. Do something adult for once. Something adult, meaning? That's not what I meant. Something grownup... Right, well, sorry... I'd love to, but I don't want to wake up Nina, and I can't leave her alone. We wouldn't leave her alone. The snack bar's next door. I'll give a Dutch kid twenty euros, a 16 or 17-year-old. They're reliable, it'll be fine. First, I can't let you pay for her babysitter. Why not? I mean, I'm her main babysitter. I should pay my replacement, it's normal. Second, I'm not leaving Nina with a kid I don't know. Think about it. The place is on fire. I know that voice. It's Edouard. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. And now... Now, my brother. My bro. He's over there. Chérif! Come on, you've no choice. Get up here! I loved one in high school... "Aline" by Christophe. Do you know it? I heard it once. That'll do. Just the chorus. Did everything go ok? She slept all the time. - Thanks. - You're welcome. It was really a very nice moment. Very calming, to watch her sleep like that. Better than a joint. Thanks. No... Thank you, she's adorable. 20 euros. Wait... I'm paying. No, don't argue. Put it away. It was a pleasure, really. I really had a nice night. I haven't danced like that in ages. Me too, ages and ages. Well, I should go. Maybe I should go, no? Hi. Hi. You sing beautifully. - You heard everything? - Yes. Thank you. A voice coming from the river, it's like a dream. It sounded like a siren. No, it was just me. Aren't you the clown I saw in town the other day? It was great. - You liked it? - Yes! You can do anything. No, I feel like a screw-up. Stop. What can I say?
