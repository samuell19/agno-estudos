YESTERDAY ﻿Benjamin Netanyahu, ﻿can you recall when you were told that Yoni died? ﻿The operation took place on the night of 3-4 July. ﻿I had just finished my studies in Boston, ﻿and a few Israeli students were sitting in my apartment. ﻿Suddenly someone burst into the room. He said he heard a report ﻿that Israeli commandos rescued the Israeli hostages in Uganda. ﻿Early that morning, the phone rang. ﻿I went to the kitchen, picked it up, and heard my'brother Ido say: "Bibi, Yoni was killed." ﻿I don't know how he kept his cool. ﻿I just remember that at that moment, ﻿my whole world came crashing down around me. ﻿Yoni was a great person. ﻿If he had lived, I have no doubt he would be leader of the country. ﻿Those are Israeli soldiers! How did they get here? ﻿- Reagan to Shultz: "You must read Netanyhu's book." - ﻿Ladies and Gentlemen, Israel's Ambassador to the United Nations, Benjamin Netanyahu. ﻿Who do we thank for your visit to Israel? ﻿The Passover holiday. ﻿I'm on vacation and it's a pleasure. ﻿A pleasure? -A pleasure. ﻿Compared to the UN? It's a huge pleasure. ﻿What's so tough about the UN? You're representing us. ﻿It's not a very welcoming place for Israelis. ﻿They don't exactly support us there. ﻿Really? They don't like us? -Not very much. ﻿You're a media star in the States. ﻿I appear on TV every so often. It's part of the job. ﻿What was your breakthrough? There are no instructions. ﻿You appear once. ﻿The American media is brutal. ﻿If they donft like you, you won't be back on. ﻿The key is to avoid gimmicks. ﻿You have to present your case. ﻿If you believe in it and tell the truth, it gets through. ﻿People want to hear you. ﻿Do you always tell the truth? ﻿I'll never lie knowingly. ﻿I may not say everything I know, ﻿but I'll never lie. ﻿You sold furniture before this, didn't you? ﻿Yep. -Is it similar? -What a question! ﻿Look. Everything... ﻿Everything you do... ﻿Is it business management? ﻿It's managing something. I﻿t's similar. ﻿Business, diplomacy, the army, ﻿every job I know, ﻿the key is to really connect with people. ﻿Benjamin Netanyahu, thank you very much. ﻿And now, the Swingles. ﻿I was bom to peace... ﻿As Ambassador to the United Nations, Bibi came under considerable criticism. ﻿They said he spent most of his life in the United States, ﻿and that he was unfamiliar with Israeli society. ﻿UN Ambassador Netanyahu submitted his resignation to Foreign Minister Peres. ﻿Ambassador Netanyahu plans to get involved in Israeli politics. ﻿He will likely run fora seat on the Likud's Knesset list. ﻿Do you see a light at the end of the tunnel. ﻿Of course I do. ﻿I don't believe that the war with the Arabs will go on forever. ﻿I think that the Arabs are people too. ﻿They won't bang their heads against the wall forever. ﻿But if they see cracks in the wall ﻿and saw that some of it was destroyed, so of course they'll continue, ﻿and the whole world will help them. ﻿What we need to do now is stand up against this, ﻿stop the evil, and unite, ﻿so that Israel will get through this, and I have no doubt that it can. ﻿But we're on a collision course with the U.S. Administration. ﻿The United States isn't a single bloc. ﻿There's the Senate, Congress. ﻿There's the Jewish lobby, which has enormous power. It's stronger than ever. ﻿There's public opinion. We have enormous influence on public opinion. ﻿The major pundits oppose this policy. ﻿America won't force anything we don't want. ﻿A missile attack on Israel has begun. This is not a test. ﻿Everyone must put on their gas masks, ﻿enter their sealed rooms, and seal the door with duct tape. ﻿but of course, what it does demonstrate-, ﻿is the kind of threat we're facing. ﻿Maybe, if you can get with me on this map... ﻿Look. This is the Arab world. ﻿I'm just going to put my hands on it ﻿for the benefit of the viewers. I have a size-10 shoe, an American size-10 shoe. ﻿I could walk on this map, on the Arab world. ﻿Here's Israel. I can cover it with my thumb. ﻿Now that tells me the whole story. ﻿Israel is one of the tiniest countries in the world. ﻿Knesset Member Benjamin Netanyahu wants to head the Likud party. ﻿He claims that voters didn't want the Likud to win ﻿because of all the infighting in the party. ﻿Restoring trust in the Likud demands what he calls, "clean politics." ﻿Here is the news for the first time, on the new Channel 2. ﻿The "big pig-out" That's one way to describe tonight's crowds ﻿storming Israel's first McDonald's. ﻿No eating here. ﻿What are you gonna do about it? ﻿Arrest me? ﻿The two of you are often compared to Bill and Hillary Clinton. ﻿Do you see it as a compliment or... ﻿We are who we are. ﻿Everyone is entitled to their opinion, ﻿but we don't make those comparisons. ﻿And now to a new scandal rocking the Likud. ﻿An anonymous source is threatening to leak intimate information ﻿about Netanyahu's affair with another woman. ﻿He called Netanyahu's wife, ﻿demanding that he drop out of the race for leader of the Likud. ﻿If not, he'll release the material, and ruin Netanyahu's reputation. ﻿Good evening, Knesset Member Netanyahu. ﻿You brought some of the American style of campaigning to Israel. ﻿So, my first question is: ﻿Did you have an affair with another woman? ﻿It happened. It ended a few months ago. ﻿It's a personal matter. if I owe anyone anything and I do, ﻿it is to my wife and family ﻿and no one else, with all due respect. ﻿It's personal, and it will stay that way. ﻿Yesterday at 6:00 p.m., an anonymous person called, ﻿while I was at an election rally. ﻿He threatened my wife, who answered the phone, ﻿that if I don't quit the race for the leadership of the Likud, ﻿he'll release the material. ﻿How did your wife react'?' Before we go on... ﻿That's all I will say. It's personal, and it will stay that way. ﻿But there is something else. This is a national crisis. ﻿If we don't uproot this phenomenon now ﻿from its very roots, ﻿I'll just be the first. ﻿There will be others, ﻿There will be others, another candidate and another, ﻿a candidate for President, for Chief of Staff, for the Supreme Court... ﻿Go ahead, Yaakov, -...and for news anchor... ﻿There's no end to it. ﻿This isn't about Benjamin Netanyahu, ﻿but about the nature of Israel's democracy. ﻿Once it has started, the cancer will spread throughout our society. ﻿- Hundreds of Bibi's supporters demonstrated their love - ﻿- "Bibigate": The Suspicion: Political Espionage Uncovered the Affair - ﻿Bibi Sinned, and I'm Paying the Price ﻿Benjamin Netanyahu was elected leader of the Likud by a huge margin. ﻿He received over 52% of the vote. ﻿A victor's triumphant entry. ﻿There's a reason they say that Netanyahu is the Israeli Clinton. ﻿He waited for the hall to fill up, ﻿and only then did he enter. ﻿Finally, I want to thank the person, ﻿who stood beside me ﻿and walked alongside me ﻿through this entire long journey, ﻿paved with obstacles and grief, ﻿and still walks beside me, ﻿my beloved wife, Sarah, who is standing here with me. Hello and good evening. ﻿Just over two hours ago, at a ceremony at the White House, ﻿Israel and the,PLO signed an agreement to grant autonomy to Jericho and Gaza first. ﻿Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin shook hands with Yasser Arafat, ﻿and there are no demonstrations outside the Prime Minister's Office. ﻿The sky didn't come crashing down. ﻿The sky came crashing down. ﻿It was a very troubling event of national humiliation. ﻿of national humiliation. ﻿I'll ask you to sing the song. ﻿Not a chance? ﻿Lets not ruin the evening. ﻿These people believe in returning every centimeter, ﻿not because of external pressure, ﻿but because of an internal desire to hand over, be rid of, to give. ﻿It's not even selling. It's giving ﻿They believe in the theory of the end of history. ﻿They really think that being surrounded by all these vicious regimes, ﻿if we give them the high ground overlooking our homes and our cities, ﻿if we give the land to Arafat, and all the other "philanthropists," ﻿peace will come. They believe it. ﻿If you ask me what the main thing in this campaign is: ﻿The main thing is that I want to live, ﻿and’we can't live with them. With them, we'd be in danger. ﻿It would be a real existential threat. ﻿That is why I am afraid. ﻿I'm worried about my home, my country. ﻿I'm even worried about my son. That's new. ﻿I have a baby now. ﻿He stood up today. He's nine-months old. ﻿I want him to stand in this country, ﻿and forthat to happen, I turn to you ﻿to leave here with the same strength, ﻿the same vitality, ﻿with the same readiness to fight for what matters, ﻿because what we're talking ﻿The Land of Israel is at stake, and we all stand with the Land of Israel. ﻿and we all stand with the Land of Israel. ﻿- Rabin is burying Zionism - ﻿say to the left ﻿and their representatives in government: ﻿When you attack the settlers ﻿you're not only attacking them. ﻿You're attacking the majority of this nation. ﻿They're quiet. True. They may not have the media. ﻿But they support the settlers and identify with the settlers, ﻿and they want the settlers. ﻿Rabin go home! Rabin go home! ﻿This terrible explosion occurred on the #5 bus. ﻿The bomb must have weighed tens of kilograms. ﻿I don't shut myself off in my office. ﻿I think all the ministers should have been there, ﻿instead of just standing on manicured lawns. ﻿They should see what's really happening. ﻿Aren't you exploiting this tragic event for political ends... ﻿These are scenes from the mass demonstration ﻿in Jerusalem's Zion Square. ﻿The crowd is very upset, very riled up. ﻿The arrival... ﻿of the blood-stained Arafat ﻿his arrival in Israel ﻿in a victory procession ﻿protected by hundreds of Israeli policemen and soldiers... ﻿Rabin's a traitor! Rabin's a traitor! ﻿...was the climax of this humiliating theater of the absurd, ﻿orchestrated by the government of Israel. ﻿Death to Rabin! Death to Rabin! Death to Rabin! ﻿Knesset Member Netanyahu asked to meet with me. ﻿I came home on Friday afternoon ﻿and saw a Likud demonstration, with people chanting, "Traitor! Murderer!" ﻿It would be'wrong on my part ﻿to play into the hypocrisy ﻿by the chairman of the Likud. ﻿He sat there and spoke under the Gestapo photos. ﻿He asks to meet, demonstrates against me... ﻿Won't you try to reduce the tension? -I don't believe him. ﻿Then it will get worse. -Maybe. ﻿Can you say that you did enough ﻿to calm the mood and expel those who may have incited Yigal Amir, ﻿who shouted, "Rabin is a murderer! Rabin is a traitor!" ﻿who shouted, "Death to the Left"? ﻿This campaign to intimidate Rabin ﻿wherever he went, shouting, "Traitor! Murderer!" ﻿They say... ﻿Stop! -I'm finishing my question. ﻿They say... But it's not true. ﻿It's all been published. ﻿They say it was inspired by the Likud's leaders. ﻿The current attempt, and unfortunately, it's real, ﻿to stigmatize an entire camp, half the people ﻿and their leader, ﻿blaming them for the assassination ﻿is terrible. ﻿It's using a national tragedy ﻿to conspire for political gain, like winning the election ﻿or silencing the opposition. ﻿Why is Arthur Finkelstein so mysterious? -Arthur Finkelstein is a good man, ﻿a good Jew. -How did you find him? ﻿He came to me. ﻿Arafat is leading Peres to the partition of Jerusalem. ﻿Peres will partition Jerusalem, ﻿There is no security. There is no peace. There is no reason to vote for Peres. ﻿All of Israel wants ﻿a safe peace... ﻿We have a wonderful country ﻿with great people. We have great young people. ﻿We have the willpower. We have hope. ﻿Actually, we have everything but two things: ﻿We have no real peace... ﻿I have no doubt that we can beat this terrorism. ﻿I have no doubt that we can push this wave back. ﻿In the mid-1980s, when the U.S. adopted the policy that I suggested, ﻿and they did adopt it, ﻿international terrorism as we knew it was wiped out. ﻿Debate '96 ﻿A good, calm, ﻿and I hope intelligent evening ﻿to our viewers at home and our two candidates. ﻿If we had to choose a model and not a prime minister, ﻿age would be an issue. ﻿I'm in excellent health, I can work a full load, ﻿and my mind is young. ﻿I know lots of people... ﻿My next question is for Benjamin Netanyahu. ﻿After your army service, you returned to the United States, ﻿took back American citizenship, and changed your name to Benjamin Nitay. ﻿Are Israelis right in thinking ﻿that you considered staying there, ﻿and not coming back to Israel? ﻿-Let me say something. I'm angry. ﻿I'm not angry at you. ﻿You're just repeating what people say. it annoys me ﻿that they are casting aspersions on my willingness ﻿to fight for this country. ﻿My family sacrificed... and fought for this country. ﻿God will help him and he will become Prime Minister. ﻿The Rabi gives fantastic advice. ﻿This is the moment. We have dramatic results fot you. ﻿Bibi, come say something to us. -Bibi, say something. ﻿Your response. ﻿The murderer won. ﻿I want a tomorrow of peace and tranquility. ﻿want a world ﻿of unity and hope. ﻿want peace ﻿that is secure. ﻿I want a young leader. ﻿want to be safe... ﻿Hurray, Bibi! ﻿Today, Israel sets off in a new direction. ﻿We believe ﻿that every citizen of Israel... ﻿Why are you shouting at the press? ﻿After all... ﻿No. ﻿As one minister in this government said, ﻿these elections will prove beyond doubt that there is a God. ﻿- To the Leftwing Media Condolences, Bibi - ﻿- Leftist journalists, go home! - ﻿Bibi, King of Israel, ﻿He's alive and well! ﻿Bibi, King of Israel, ﻿He's alive and well! ﻿Bibi, King of Israel, ﻿He's alive and well! ﻿Bibi, King of Israel, ﻿He's alive and well! I don't see her. ﻿People, what do you want from the media? ﻿Okay, I get it. You want us to privatize the media. I get it. Thank you very much. I don't hear well. I didn't understand. ﻿In the weekend papers, for instance, ﻿what haven't they said about you? You're easily pressured, impulsive, ﻿a political novice... Are they being unfair? ﻿Listen... If I paid attention to what the press writes about me, ﻿and what the media says about me, ﻿I wouldn't be fit to sit at this desk. ﻿- Behind his back - ﻿- Time Magazine -"Netanyahu is undecisive"- ﻿- The Sarah Netanyahu Case - ﻿This week, Sarah Netanyahu received harsh criticism. ﻿It happened after the nanny was fired ﻿for what she claims was mistakenly leaving soup on the stove until it burned. ﻿One month after her husband became Prime Minister, ﻿Sarah Netanyahu was caught in the media's crosshairs. ﻿Mrs. Netanyahu, all sorts of things have been written about you, ﻿raising the question... ﻿And 99.9999 percent are wrong. -Nice, ﻿because I was going to ask what percent is right and what isn't. ﻿I read your mind. -99.9 percent. Okay. ﻿-It's because I'm good at math. love numbers. ﻿I'll surprise you. I won't get into the gossip. ﻿I'll just ask questions that I think, ﻿as the prime minister's wife, you do have to answer. ﻿For example, they say that ﻿you and your husband have an agreement, ﻿and that he owes you all sorts of things, ﻿like taking you everywhere. -First of all... ﻿-Yes, trips abroad... ﻿First of all, ﻿Yes, trips abroad. -To respect you and consult with you... ﻿To consult with you. To hold your hand contractually. ﻿Contractually. ﻿First, consider ﻿that much of the media collaborates with the Opposition, ﻿with the Left. ﻿Furthermore, there are a lot of people ﻿who want... to hurt us. That's no secret either. ﻿They try to use their ties to the media ﻿to change history. ﻿They say that he can't' make up his mind, ﻿that there are promises he doesn't keep. ﻿I don't want to get into all that. ﻿Are you happy with... -No. ﻿Hold on. When things don't... ﻿Avner, don't put your feet on the table! ﻿Avner, no. You don't go into there! No! No! Avner no. ﻿I will play something. Can you play 'Yonatan'? ﻿I'll teach you. Yair, let me... Look, you choose a note. ﻿This is the deal: an Attorney General for an‘agreement. ﻿Mr. Prime Minister, the responses to last night's story on Channel One ﻿called it nothing less than racketeering and Mafia rule. Were you surprised by the story? ﻿If there is a plot, it's this political defamation ﻿with no'basis. ﻿You have to act like a responsible press! ﻿You're holding a gun. ﻿You have a mouth and a camera. ﻿You can't just make things up about a government or a prime minister, ﻿and say things with no basis, without checking them, ﻿without knowing that there really is a basis forthem, ﻿and there'is no basis for any of this. ﻿It's clear now that the Likud ﻿is run by a gang of power-hungry people with no restraints. ﻿Heading this gang is a man who used extortion and deception, ﻿and this will send the Likud reeling. ﻿It's worth noting before I hand the broadcast back to you: ﻿the Prime Minister asked for just one camera in his office, ﻿with no journalists present. ﻿There will be no questions. ﻿The simple truth is that for political motives, ﻿some members of the media, ﻿particularly TV's Channel One, ﻿are still unwilling to come to terms with the voters' decision in the last election. ﻿They try to challenge the government's legitimacy almost every evening. ﻿They will not succeed. ﻿In a democracy, only you, the voters, can decide the country's direction. ﻿I want to know if you realize ﻿that in the heat of this struggle, what you are doing ﻿is destroying those elites ﻿and centers of power, without which we would have no democracy. ﻿I mean a strong police force, an independent judiciary, ﻿the Supreme Court, a free press. -Not at all. ﻿You can say it again and again. ﻿But you address the people over the heads of this media elite. ﻿You asked a question. Let me answer it. ﻿The first thing we need here is more freedom, ﻿more decentralization, more privatization, ﻿more broadcasters. ﻿so citizens can hear different opinions and decide on their own. ﻿Large groups of people here feel like they have no say. ﻿I read a long interview with you. ﻿You said, "Sometimes I feel ﻿"like the country is full of halls, with TVs broadcasting ﻿"the message to hate’Bibi'Netanyahu. - ﻿"Hate himm! Hate him! Hate him!" ﻿Do you really hear voices and imagine rooms full of people, ﻿saying "Hate Bibi Netanyahu" ﻿Every night there's fierce incitement on TV, ﻿and not just on TV but throughout the media. ﻿Just open the daily paper. Are you being naive? ﻿- Top Minister: Replace the Leadership Netanyahu: It's a Putsch - -The Magic Is Over- ﻿Can I ask you a personal question? ﻿Please. Ask. ﻿Aren't you isolated? You're all alone. ﻿It's like your office is under siege. ﻿I have to tell you something. ﻿Leaders have to learn how to be loners. ﻿I don't know any leader of stature in the twentieth century, ﻿who wasn't alone at-some point, and even very alone. ﻿Hello. ﻿Let me congratulate you ﻿for visiting the website of the Prime Minister's Office. ﻿On this site, you can find all sorts of information ﻿about the Prime Minister's Office and about my activities. ﻿You don't have to rely on interpreters and mediators. ﻿You can ask what you want, ﻿go where you want. ﻿You can decide what you hear, what you see, ﻿and even what you think. ﻿I think it's refreshing. ﻿That's the future to which I'm committed. ﻿Only Bibi! Only Bibi! -Why? -Only Bibi! He's the Number One politician in the country: Bibi Netanyahu! ﻿He has a mouth that can wrap the whole country around his finger. ﻿Come on, man! ﻿Tell me one time. I watch all the shows. ﻿Tell me one time you said nice things about the right... ﻿one tiny little time. ﻿Why? Did you ever see me favor the left? ﻿Always. If you're against the right, then you're for the left, right? ﻿What can you do? We're not as dumb as you think, ﻿as you think. ﻿We need a prime minister to stand up to the world, not a sucker! ﻿Someone who knows how to lie too. We need a prime minister who's an asshole, son of a bitch! ﻿-Liar- ﻿Over the last day there's been ﻿Ehud Barak and the Labor Party. ﻿Is that Finkelstein's latest recommendation? ﻿Did Finkelstein send Peres to Ramallah to declare a Palestinian state? ﻿Did Finkelstein do that? ﻿I asked about Barak. ﻿I stopped the partition of Jerusalem. ﻿You're taking time away from our guest, ﻿whom you love so much, so quiet, please. ﻿Let Israel TV hear some applause. ﻿They're applauding their prime minister. ﻿Yay, Bibi! ﻿I have one thing to tell you. ﻿I can't compete with you over manipulating an audience. ﻿I give up. ﻿Why do you think they're robots and not people with feelings? ﻿Don't you think they're expressing how they feel? ﻿You know.how to exploit them, while I donH, ﻿So, I suggest... ﻿I'm asking for quiet. Excuse me! ﻿People, please! I'rrii asking for quiet! ﻿Show some respect for Knesset Member Ehud Barak. ﻿I apologize, Knesset Member Barak! ﻿When he finished, you wanted... -You have no reason to apologize. ﻿We're the hosts. -Only... ﻿Only people in crisis, because they know ﻿the voters' verdict is coming and will remove them once and for all, ﻿like a political traffic accident. ﻿It wasn't-a total'loss, and it's behind us now. ﻿Only people in that kind ofcrisis can act like this ﻿on Israel's official network. ﻿Vast amounts of people are signing up. Ask yourselves, ﻿why are they signing up? ﻿There's one reason they're signing up. ﻿They are terrified! ﻿They are terrified! ﻿They are terrified! ﻿They are terrified! ﻿They are terrified! ﻿﻿They are terrified! ﻿They are terrified! ﻿They are terrified! ﻿In the only round in the 1999 election, ﻿the next Prime Minister is Ehud Barak, by a large margin. ﻿For almost 20 years, I've been in public service ﻿on behalf of the State of Israel, ﻿Bibi! Bibi! Bibi! ﻿Forward, Bibi! ﻿Forward, Bibi! ﻿so I am announcing my plans to resign from the leadership of the Likud party. ﻿When people say, "former Prime Minister," ﻿do you realize they're talking about you? -Of course. ﻿Does the word "former" bother you? -No, listen. ﻿'ll surprise you. I'rn a democrat, ﻿with a capital D. ﻿I never imagined staying in power forever, ﻿not in the Likud, and not in the country. ﻿I always told my son that the house we live in ﻿is temporary. ﻿Today, we're fortunate to have with us someone who's been leading the fight against terrorism ﻿for most of his life ﻿And there are many of us, and I'm certainly one of them, who considers you, frankly, ﻿the Winston Churchill of our times. ﻿ThiThis is the story of power, fortune, and a newspaper ﻿Billionaire Sheldon Adelson, ﻿who earns an estimated $1 million an hour, decided to publish a free newspaper. ﻿The new paper is sending shockwaves through' Israel's established press. -Likud Supporters are called to the ballots- ﻿-Netanyahu: "we will win"- ﻿Today, we're in danger of annihilation. It's that simple. ﻿It's not just an existential threat, but a real threat of annihilation. ﻿People think that annihilation, i.e., the Holocaust, is over, ﻿but it's not over. It's always happening. ﻿He'd be an excellent Foreign Minister. ﻿He could be an excellent Finance Minister too. ﻿But I think that given the current circumstances, ﻿he's the... ﻿the best candidate for Prime Minister. ﻿The people have spoken loud and clear. ﻿I really appreciate and admire how you sacrifice ﻿for Israel and the Jewish people. ﻿And it's...
