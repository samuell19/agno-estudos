What are you doing here? Hanna, honey, I have something I want to talk to you about. What's up? I was thinking about inviting Cameron over for dinner. I think it's time the two of you met. Sure. I mean, I know it's just been the two of us for so long now, but I think that... As I was saying... Do I look okay? Yes, honey. You look very nice. I find out if I'm a finalist for the scholarship today. If I get this scholarship, you won't have to work as many double shifts for my college fund. I am sure they will pick you, honey, and either way, we will work it out. Today is not about me, it's about you pursuing your dreams. Mwah. Thanks, mom. Oh, I got to go. Alright, see you. See you. Oh, and you should totally invite Cameron, and make your lasagne. Michael: Madison! I'm right here. There's no need to yell. I thought you were still in bed. I have an important meeting this afternoon, so I probably won't be home until late tonight. You gonna be okay on your own? Of course, Daddy. Why would tonight be any different? Well, maybe tonight you actually do some homework. You need to raise your grades before colleges request your transcripts. I don't even want to go... Madison, we've had this discussion already. You're going to college. Have you thought about maybe getting a tutor? We'll talk about this later. I gotta go. Good work, Miss Fletcher. Seriously? Stop making us look bad. Okay, but what'd you get for that one? Oh, girl, you are way off. Do you think he knows I skipped 7th period yesterday? You did? Hanna? Please tell me you have... Not so loud. Yeah, I have your project. First, there's a matter of payment. Now can I have my project? I won't keep you in suspense. You're a finalist! Top of your class, captain of the cheerleading squad, class president. You're a college recruiter's dream. Well, I took my entrance exams last summer, but I'm totally happy to do them again if... No need. The interview focuses on upstanding moral character. My secretary will contact you with all the scheduling. Okay, cool. And congratulations. We're all very proud of you. Thank you. I am so over this day. Please tell me you have something. Don't take it all. Okay, we've made our appearance. Can we go now? Hey, Madison! Why aren't you in class? Go! Go, go! Where are you going? Are you okay to drive? You don't look it. I'm barely buzzed. I'll be fine. Just take the empties. Oh, and make sure you recycle it. She's in room 12. I was just in there. Okay, thank you. Madison! Are you ok? Aunt Amanda? I... I'm totally fine. I shouldn't even be here really. Hey, can you stop them from calling Dad? It's procedure. We have to. Driving while intoxicated? What's going on? I don't know. I don't know. Look, lately, just everything has been so crazy and I'm starting to feel... Young lady, do you have any idea how much trouble you're in? Do you? I had to walk out of an important meeting. I come here and I find out you didn't just total another car, but you were driving drunk? I wasn't drunk. That's what you want to say to me right now? You know what? You're lucky I spoke to the officer and he's just letting you off with a warning. Having that on your record could ruin your future. Don't look at your Aunt. She'd never find Hanna doing something so stupid. Mike. I wish Mom was still here. If your mom was still here, what you did today would've killed her. Michael, that is not fair! Stay out of this, Amanda. Can I talk to you for a minute outside, please? Come on. I get that you're upset, but this could have been a whole lot worse. Maybe you could just ease up a little? Madison is my child. She's my sister's child, too. You can at least tell her that you are glad she's okay. Of course I'm glad she's ok. Well, don't tell me. Tell her! You know what, Amanda? Just back off. Don't, Michael. Do not do that. Do not push me away again. We're done here. There you go. You do realize it'll take at least an hour of work to earn enough to pay for those drinks? Okay, new rule. No math during work hours. Okay. Besides, nothing's too good for you. Chai Latte. My favourite. What's your favourite? Maybe you could find out if we get coffee together this weekend? That was incredibly awkward. No, it wasn't. I messed up. I... I, um... I'm really just trying to ask you out, I guess. I would like that very much. Well, the shelves aren't going to stock themselves, so... Okay, yeah. Sorry. Madison, we need to talk. Is it about the color of my new car? 'Cause I'm thinking a mirror finish this time. I agree you need a car, but no more sports cars. This time, it's going to be something safe like an SUV. Do I look like a soccer mom? No, but you'll drive like one. As far as school, I think you need to be more like your cousin Hanna. - Daddy... - Don't Daddy me. You're about to learn that actions have consequences. You don't get into college, you won't have my financial support. He said that? What are you going to do? Whatever I have to. And one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. There's going to be lots of hot guys there. She already has someone she's interested in. A secret guy? You don't know him. He just goes to another school. Brookside Academy. So, he's some rich douche. Not at all. He's actually there on a scholarship. We work together and he tutors. He's really smart and cute. Has he asked you out yet? I'll see you guys later. Hey, Madison. How are you? Tonight? Well, I kind of have an important dinner thing to get to, so... Oh, perfect. You're here. - Hey. - Hey. Cute sweater. Thanks. Drew, I thought that was your car outside. Yeah, we... We have a... We have a project, so... Cool. Yeah. Well, enough chit chat. Hanna, I have an emergency. I'm totally desperate for your help. What's up? So, I know it's been a while since I've given you any of my hand me downs, but Daddy says at least half this stuff had to go so I figure the least I can do is help you update your own closet. Come on, let's try some stuff on. This is the emergency? Actually, I have my college entrance exams on Saturday and I am so not ready. Oh, well, I have a few practice tests if you want. Or you could just write it for me. Are you serious? Oh, come on. You could totally pass for me. Uh, I'm not going to help you cheat. But I'll help you study. I'm totally kidding. Of course, you'll help me cram, right? Of course. Cool. You must try this one on. It would look so gorgeous on you. Uh, it's not really my style. We're just having fun. Come on, strip. I will go make us some mocktails. How's my homework coming? Wow! Here you go. Thanks. Should we go check on Drew? You like him, don't you? First, these are great mocktails, so drink up. Ooh, try this one on. This is fun, right? Sure. Go. Okay. So cute. Yes. Oh, wow! Look at you, miss thing. Yes, you look gorgeous. Thank you. See? You look amazing. Hanna: Hi. Hi. Wow. You two should totally get a picture. Come on, get close to her. Put your arm around her, come on. You guys should totally kiss. Don't pretend like you don't want to. Come on. Just do it already. Oh, baby. Okay. Is she okay? What did you... She's just tired. She works so hard. Did you spike Hanna's drink? Of course not. Although she may have had a sip of mine and, yeah, it's pretty loaded. Oh, come on. You've been wanting to kiss her. Not like that. What did you put in her drink? Nothing, I swear. See? Zero alcohol. Happy? You'd think she'd know better than to drink mine, but it's fine, okay? I'll take care of her. Such a lightweight. Look, I gotta get home, but you promise me... I promise. Go. Drive safe. Rise and shine, Princess. What happened? Check it out. We had so much fun last night. Oh, my God. Madison, what are those? You don't know? You wrote on me? It's just lipstick. It'll wash off. You made it look like I'm... A trashy slut? You haven't even seen the best part. You have to delete those. I will. I promise. Just as soon as you take the test for me on Saturday. What? No! I already... Look, the choice is simple. Either I can post these everywhere, or you can take the test for me. You'd get in trouble. I would tell everyone that it was you. Maybe, but you're still the one who would lose. All those college applications? The extra shifts your mom's been working, and that big scholarship? Even if you told them they were photoshopped, which they're obviously not, would they really want to be associated with this? How did you... No one can see that! Okay, then all you have to do is write one little test for me. Why are you doing this? Because Daddy says if I don't get into college, then he's cutting me off financially. He says he wants me to be more like you. I'm sorry that he said that, but, Madison, this isn't right. You wouldn't... I wouldn't dare? Should I post these on social media or just text your contacts directly? No, no, no, please! Just one test? That's all. Where have you been? Uh, Madison's. This whole time? Yeah. She invited me over and gave me some more hand-me-downs. I called you and texted, and you didn't reply. I'm sorry. I fell asleep and Madison didn't wake me up. Dinner with Cameron! Mom, I'm so sorry. I really do want to meet him. Do you? Because if you have any reservations, you can talk to me. I know, but I don't. I told Madison I had a dinner thing, but she didn't care. It was all about her. She's not that bad. Maybe she just figured you needed the sleep? Did you get some nice clothes? Yeah. You okay? Just tired. Nothing some leftover lasagne can't fix, right? Well, it is always better the next day. I'll get you some. Horrible news about Drew. What do you mean? How do you not know? Kid drove his car into a tree. Do you think he was drunk? How would I know? Weren't you guys working on a project together? It's funny. He actually never showed up. Really? Mm-hm. Poor guy. Okay, he has a couple of bumps and bruises. He's in a coma. Mrs. Mia? Hanna. So nice to meet you. I'm Beatrice Mia, here on behalf of the Jefferson Scholarship Committee. As a finalist, you are already amongst an elite group, but in this final phase, we want to delve a little deeper. Find the story behind the statistics. Shall we get started? Yes, Ma'am. What made you want to be a doctor? Well, my mom's an amazing nurse. I've always wanted to help people, you know? Be more like her. We even call ourselves Team Fletcher. So, you really rely on her? Of course, she's my mom, but... Yes? She'd just had to work really hard for us. I try to handle as much as I can myself. Do you consider yourself to be a person of good character? I try, but nobody's perfect, right? Exactly. That's why the interview committee likes to provide our candidates an opportunity to explain any past mistakes. Have you ever done anything you regret? Not yet. Well, hello. You've been avoiding me. Mr. Parker, don't be silly. Can I call you Jim? You missed your practice test... I'm so busy. No time for practice. The real test is coming. That sounds like a dire prophecy. Okay, cut it out, Ms. Willits. Look, I know that you want out of here. Oh, I really do. Then you need to get serious about your college entrance exam. You know, people really need to stop underestimating me. I'm a lot smarter than people give me credit for. I've never doubted your intelligence. So, I will see you Saturday? Wait, why? I'm volunteering as a proctor of the test. I'll be able to wish you luck. Gotta go. See you later. Mm-hm. You heard about your boy Drew? What? Hey. Maybe he's more than just a work friend, huh? Yeah, he asked me out this weekend. I was going to tell you. I know you can't really say much, but he's going to be alright, right? It's just too early to tell, but he could make a full recovery. You've got to hold on to that, okay? I need to go. Hey, I'm sure there's a part of him that knows you're here. This is too much. With the interview today, and I have a bunch of homework. I just... I gotta go. You're gonna watch over him, right? He's a really good guy. Of course. Hanna: I know the drill, Madison. Well, just a couple of reminders. Hanna: Fine. There's gonna be kids from all over the county there and just a couple from my school. Just stand like you're ready to go into a fight, not cheer for one, okay? Hanna: Whatever. Anyone who actually knows me will take that as a sign to just give me my space. Most importantly, do not let my guidance counselor Mr. Parker get a close look at you. He'll be wearing this hideous blue cardigan. Such a dweeb. Do what I say and everything's going to be fine, okay? Hanna: Yup. He's not gonna be a problem for long. Why is it so hard to get into college? Hello? What? Yeah, I'll be right there. Thank you. I've got an emergency at my home. Uh, I'll try to make it back. I'm sorry. Excuse me, sorry. Mom, I thought you had a shift. What is with this new look? You look more like, uh, Madison. Her way of thanking me for a last minute cram session. It seems a bit dramatic for day. Mm-hm. I'm looking forward to washing it all off. So, the thing is, I don't personally think... Who's that? It's my cousin. I should probably go see what she wants. Okay, don't be late. What? Wow. No foreplay or anything, huh? Ew, why are you so... Alright, let me stop you from saying something you're going to regret later. Okay, weekend's over, and so is our deal. Did you delete the pictures? I've actually been rethinking that. What do you mean? I need you to write my college entrance essays. You said it would be one test. I held up my end of the deal, now you have to as well. Geez, you'd think you might just want to help me because I'm your cousin. I don't know why you make me go to such extremes. I would help you, it's just you're not really asking for help. Touché. Here are the essay prompts for the colleges I'm applying to. Princeton? Columbia? UPenn? Mm, just my safety school. Well, with your GPA, I think you should apply to State College. Gross. Now, come on, if I have to go to college, I'm at least going somewhere with some prestige. Come on, Hanna. It's just a few essays. It's so easy for you. No. I can't just keep doing stuff for you. I won't. Sure you will. I mean, if those photos aren't enough to ruin you, I'm pretty sure fraudulent test taking will be. Now, how about those essays, huh? When do you need them by? Mr. Parker: Madison, got a minute? Mr. Parker, always a delight. I was surprised to see your name on the test roster on Saturday. You actually showed up. Yeah, I feel really good about it. You seem confident. Definitely. I was kind of surprised though. I didn't see you there. I had a last minute emergency. Oh, no, you have to rush home? I didn't say anything about my home. Just guessing. And is that how you approach a test, too? My scores might impress you, Parker. Don't underestimate me. Okay. How do I look? You look beautiful. Okay, can you take care of that? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hi. Oh, thank you. So nice. They're beautiful. Hanna, Cameron. Cameron, Hanna. Hi, how are you? Nice to meet you. You, too. I was expecting a pocket protector. Ah, yes, computer technology specialist. Normally I sport one, but for special occasions I like to dress it up. Good call. - Would you, uh... - Yeah. Thanks. What are you working on? Uh, college entrance essay. I'm editing this for my cousin. Ah, it's that time of year. Yeah. I hope everyone's hungry. Yeah, I'm starving. Okay, well, let's, uh, let's eat. I hope it's good. So, the guy made hundreds of fraudulent purchases on the credit card, from dog food to Gucci loafers, never realizing it can be traced. And you caught him? Go, Cameron! The things people do. He'll have plenty of time to reflect. Hi, Madison. Right now? I'm kind of in the middle of dinner. Okay, I'll be right over. Really? Go ahead. I'm sorry. It's okay. How you doing? Almost done. Oh, good. You can do my pre-calc assignment, too. I gotta get home. I have my own homework to do. Hm, sounds like a you problem. It's okay. You can bring it by my school tomorrow. All the way to Brookside? Obviously. What's going on with you? You haven't responded to any of my texts. I haven't received any texts. Whatever. Ms. Davis: Hanna, I didn't get your homework. I'm so sorry, Ms. Davis.. Can I get an extension? Not on a homework assignment. If it's just once, it won't affect your grade that much, but is something wrong? Hey, kiddo. Your vitals looks good, so maybe try waking up today? I'm trying to get Hanna to come see you again, but she's been busy helping Madison with her college... Hey, calm down, Drew. What's gotten your heart rate going so fast? His vitals were stable 30 seconds ago but just spiked. Such a nice colour for you. It's gonna look so nice. You're done? Did we start early? I texted you. I'm so sorry, coach. I didn't know. This was delivered for you. Parker, not so much of a delight when you appear out of nowhere. Are you practicing your magic tricks? That's interesting because your SUV appeared out of nowhere too. What do you mean? It's kind of strange how you could be here taking the test and yet at the same time vandalizing my home. Maybe you're the magician being in two places at one time. Again, I don't know what you mean. I was here. Except, my neighbor saw a vehicle that looks just like yours driven by someone who looks just like you. That is weird, because I was here. You know, you keep saying that. I'm still not believing you. I'd be careful throwing around such unfounded accusations. Working hard? Yeah. I'm not supposed to say anything, but we got some test results back today, and your friend Drew had Rohypnol in his system. Drew doesn't do drugs. I believe you. We see it at the hospital all too frequently investigating this type of thing, but it's just different when it's someone so close to my own girl. Promise me you'll be careful, okay? Yeah. Of course, I'll be careful. Okay. What are you doing here? Well, I just found out that Drew had Rohypnol in his system the night of his car accident. The same night that I have absolutely no recollection of. So, what are you saying? Drew never took drugs. You must have slipped him something, and me, too. Was it the drink? Nice conspiracy theory, Hanna Banana, but, uh... He's not a goody two shoes like you. Only one good shoe at most. Whatever. He is a good, honest, decent person. Hanna, who do you think I had doing all of my work before you? What? Your golden boy was a world class cheater. I paid him to do it all. Well, you took advantage of him, his financial situation, just like you're taking advantage of me. Maybe. You're not going anywhere. Why do you do this to people? How can you live with yourself? How can you live with yourself? You know, you've done things that you're not proud of, and in case you've forgotten, you still have the most to lose here. Well, the police are investigating, and I'm not going to let you get away with this anymore. You have it so good because you have a mom. Somebody who cares about you. And remembers your birthday and what sizes you wear, but you are not better than me, Hanna. I never said I was. You don't even know how good you have it. Your mother does everything for you. We both lost parents. You have a dad and I don't. No. No, you're wrong because see, when I lost my mom, I also lost my dad. Mike: Madison, come down here. Are you nervous? I've seen you working with Hanna and applying yourself. I just hope it shows up in the grade report. So do I. Open please, Daddy. I still have a C in Pre-Calc? My teacher hates me. Well, check out that B+ in Econ. I worked hard on that project. So, do you think my grades are good enough to get me into UPenn? Well, it'll help if they continue to improve, and of course, we still don't have your entrance exam scores yet. They can make or break you. I feel really good about them. Still, after three years of not taking school seriously, it's going to take a lot of hard work to raise your GPA. Maybe you should consider joining some extracurricular clubs or maybe doing some community service or something like that. Or I could transfer to Elmwood. Transfer to Elmwood? I'm sending you to one of the best schools in the western hemisphere. Exactly. Look, colleges can see that I'm struggling there, but if I transfer and I continue to improve my grades and I get killer exam scores, then it looks like I'm a great student and Brookside was just the wrong environment for me. That's actually not a bad idea. That could work. But listen to me carefully. I still mean it. If you don't get into college, you won't have my financial support. No more clothes, no more cars. You do understand that, don't you? If we do this, and that's a big if, I don't want to hear any excuses about how hard it is to change schools mid-year. Daddy, I will be their queen. What are you doing here? Did I not mention that I transferred? What? You can't... Actually I can. Public school. Now, it's gonna be so much easier for you to do all of my homework. All? Madison... I'd like straight As. I really can't talk right now, Madison. You think you'd be a little more welcoming. Are you serious? Do you remember the last time we saw each other? Okay, I admit I overreacted a bit, but so did you. No, you can't be trusted. That is such an understatement. I can be trusted, but I need to get into college, and you can trust me to do whatever is necessary to make sure that happens. Whatever is necessary except your own work. Hanna, I'm a realist. I know that you're my best bet. Hanna? Is that you? Oh, hi. I did hear something good about you. Really? Your principal mentioned that you're on the list of Stellar Students. Thank you. It's an honor. And I also have some news about the scholarship. We've had a wonderful influx of donors and now we can guarantee to meet the full costs of not only tuition and books, but also room and board. Oh, wow. A full ride? That's amazing! That sounds life changing. Indeed. Mrs. Mia, this my cousin Madison. And you decide if Hanna gets this scholarship? I'm on the committee, yes. That's great. So, what brings you to Elmwood? We check in on our finalists every so often. We try to be thorough. Oh, well, you haven't talked to me yet. Well, if there's anything else you need... Oh, take it from a cousin. I mean, the things I could tell you. Well, I'm sure if she needs a refe... Come on, let me tell you a secret, hm? I mean, she won't tell you something like that, but I will. I'm a tell-all waiting to happen. What did you say? We should get to class. We don't want Hanna doing anything to jeopardize that that big scholarship, huh? I'll will talk to you again soon. Okay. Okay, seriously, what did you say? You only need to worry about what I could say, or show her. Okay. Fine. I get it. Tell me about this Stellar Student List? It's a list honoring the top students at Elmwood. Hey, cousin. Sit with me. Guess you guys don't have sushi days like my old school, huh? Maybe you should go back there. I'll ignore that this time. I have a new assignment for you. I already do all your assignments. Well, this one is extra. What? I want you to get me on the Stellar Student List. I checked around. It's an impressive thing. There's no way. You have to be nominated by at least two teachers. Being on that list would convince a school to give me a chance. The list is not student run. I can't just alter the names. You know, you're a really smart girl, but you need to learn to think outside the box. Put your imagination to work. I'm sure you can figure it out. You, and everybody else, really need to learn to stop underestimating me. Not only do I have everything on that phone backed up, but I am also fully committed to seeing this plan through. Have I made my point, Hanna? Yes. Yes, I'm sorry. There will be repercussions. Like Daddy always says, actions have consequences. Get me on that list tonight, Hanna. Hanna, come join me. I don't think Hanna's feeling too well. Is she okay? Oh, yeah. She'll be fine. She has not been herself lately. I'm actually am really glad we have a moment to speak in private. Because I've been wanting to tell you that I don't agree with Hanna. About what? I don't think that your butt is too big. She said what? I mean, look if you want to go through with a nose job... She said I need a nose job? I'm just saying I could see the benefit, but I definitely don't think you need to lose weight. Hanna said I need to lose weight? Oh, was that something she was just saying to me? I thought she spoke about this openly with you. She's never mentioned any of that to me. I am so sorry. I feel terrible. I just wanted to support you, that's all. Really. I think that you are so gorgeous, and I mean, Hanna's so smart that sometimes she just thinks she knows what's best for everybody else, too I shouldn't have said anything. Just forget I brought it up, okay? Please don't tell Hanna I said anything. I'm glad I know what she really thinks about me. Don't bother changing. Why? Everyone else has been at it for at least thirty minutes. You don't even realize you're late, do you? No, because it's Hanna's world. Why are you in here? I asked Coach for the privilege of telling you myself. Telling me what? You're off the team. What? Why? This isn't fair. What's not fair is that everyone else shows up on time every time and puts 100% into this. You are late, you're distracted, you don't respond to texts. What texts? Like the text about practice time being changed. Look, I'll talk to Coach. You have broken team rules. Team's voted. Coach is backing me on this. You're off the squad. And lastly, if you have something to say about me, say it to me or keep your mouth shut. What are you talking about now? I told you you'd have to pay. Please stop. I know what I did wasn't nice. Do what I asked you to do. Just do it tonight. The cheesecake, it was incredible. It's so good. You're late. Again. Do you want to tell me where you've been? School. No, it is going to take more of an explanation than that, young lady. Can you leave me alone? You are out of line. And, honey, I am worried about you. You know I can take care of myself. We take care of each other. We're a team. Yeah, right. I've never felt more alone. Okay, that is enough. Start talking. What is going on with you? Nothing is going on. I had homework so I was doing it at school. I didn't realize how late it got. And why didn't you reply to any of my texts, then? Why does everyone keep saying that? I have not received any texts! There's no text from you. There is the text that I sent you, Hanna. Okay, I don't get it. Is my phone broken or something? May I? Ah, that's it. What? Your mom was blocked. What? Whoa, wait. I never blocked you! Check Jill. Yep. She's blocked too. Okay, what is going on? Apparently, someone got into my phone and played a trick on me. I've unblocked them, but you might want to check your other contacts. I will. Thank you. You know what? I'm gonna warm you up some dinner, and then we are going to have a talk. No, no, no. I really tired and I just need to go to sleep. I'm so sorry about that. Oh, no. Don't be. I haven't seen her like this for a very long time. She's got a lot of pressure on her and she's been helping Madison a lot too. That's all extra. Luckily, she's also got you for a mother. Yeah. No way. A cousin. That's how she did it. Hi. I know you can beat this. You have to. There's still so much you have to do. You still owe me a date. I know you're still here. I know you're still fighting. I am, too. What are you doing here? You usually put such practiced charm into your greetings. That was when I had to stay on your good side. Yeah, right. You burned that bridge or should I say, smashed it? Are you going to tell me what you're doing here? I'm here to talk to your new principal, but he's at a conference, so I'm gonna come back tomorrow. Maybe you could leave a message. I know how you did it. I know how you managed to be in two places at one time, but what I don't know is how you convinced your cousin Hanna to go along with it. I'm going to talk to your new principal about the academic stuff and I'm just waiting on the security footage from the test and I'm pretty confident it's going to show that Hanna was there instead of you. You don't know anything. Just think about it. If you're as smart as you think you are, you'll turn yourself in. What are you doing here? I know you're under a lot of pressure, but if you're not gonna come clean then we don't have anything to talk about. Come on, I've worked too hard. I can't let you ruin everything for me now. Get off my property. Now. Go. Oh, my God. Daddy! What are you doing here? Wait. What? The Stellar Student List? Honey, that is wonderful! Oh, I know you've worked so hard. What do you want, Madison? Why can't your friend Kitty come pick you up? She got you there. Because genius, then my father would realize that I'm not at your house studying. Oh, come on, it's barely a block away. What is the problem? If you don't, I'll show everyone the pictures. Okay, you win. I'm on my way. Madison: 1887, Giles Avenue. Where are you going? Madison: Is that your mom? Who is that on the phone? Madison. She wants me to... I don't care what she wants. You tell her you're not available tonight. Wait until she goes, and then sneak out. I can't come, Madison. Like I told you, just do what I say and everything's going to be fine. I'm not coming. Give me the phone. But as you know, there will be consequences. What did she mean there will be consequences? You're going to start explaining now, and this time, I want the truth. Okay. Talk to me. I didn't want to worry you, but then things got out of control. What things? Tell me. I think Madison roofied me. What? I mean, she must have. After I found out about Drew, I wanted to see if the same thing happened to me. So, I got tested. You tested positive. That little... I think I needed those results to believe this nightmare's real. Yeah, but... but why? Why would she do this to you? She took pictures, Mom. Bad ones. When I was unconscious. And she took off all my clothes. What? And she's been using the pictures to blackmail me. She's been making me do all of her homework. And a lot more. Why didn't you come to me sooner? I thought I could handle it myself. Right. My brave, strong girl. I'm so sorry that you went through this. This is no longer your burden, okay? Okay. I'm handling this now. Uh, hello? Do you have any idea what your daughter has been up to? Yes, I know she's at a party. I can track her phone with mine. I'm not going to hold it against Hanna. What do you mean hold it against Hanna? Well, instead of studying, Hanna took Madison to the party. No, Hanna was asleep in her room. Are you sure about that? Yes. Yes, I am sure about that. I found her on the phone as Madison was trying to blackmail her into picking her up and saying they were studying together. Blackmailed? With what? Madison drugged Hanna. She took compromising photos and has been holding them over her head for months and Hanna's been doing all of Madison's homework. Don't be ridiculous. I know Madison can tell a good story, but I mean, Hanna, that's a a whole other level. She got tested, Michael. It came back positive for Rohypnol. Look, I understand your concern that someone tried to take advantage of Hanna, but you don't know Madison. No, you don't know Madison. She roofied Drew, putting him in the hospital. She roofied Hanna. Hold it right there. You might have proof they've both been roofied, but you have nothing that proves Madison did it. Madison has turned her life around. She has a really good chance to get into this great school, and now you're saying she did it all by cheating? I'm sorry, yeah. How dare you make such accusations? Just because Hanna's been a handful lately, don't redirect your daughter's failures onto mine. Okay, Michael, you are not listening to me. You don't hear me. I know when you see me, you see my sister, and you are angry that she's gone, but... You know what? You just can't handle that my daughter is finally the smart one. No, I can't handle that your daughter is a criminal. I, uh... I have to go to the police. Okay, just hold on. Hold on. I'm sorry. It's late, this is all very upsetting. Okay, maybe we should get some rest and just deal with this tomorrow. Please. If Madison goes near Hanna... You have my word. And, I... I'd like your word that Hanna won't do anything to hurt Madison. Uh, yes. How can I help you officers? Good evening, sir. Mind if we step inside for a chat? Uh, yeah, sure. Come on in. So, what's going on? I'm Detective Frey and this is my partner. May we ask you a few questions about Madison Willits? Uh, that's my daughter, yes, but she's out for the evening. We're here because your daughter's SUV was spotted on Walnut Street this afternoon. Are you investigating whether she skipped school or not? Would it be possible to examine your daughter's SUV? Do you have a warrant? Not yet, but we are investigating a vehicular fatality and we believe your daughter may be a person of interest. You've got to be kidding me. A fatality? I'm sorry, detective, but not without a warrant. We'll get one. Thank you for your time. Oh, my God. Daddy. Madison, Hanna's mom told me everything. Listen, don't believe anything that Aunt Amanda says, okay? It's all Hanna, I swear. I found the pictures, but baby girl, listen to me. The police were here. Honey, what were you doing on Walnut Street? Daddy, nothing. Nothing. It was nothing. I... Look, I can fix it. I can, okay? Please just... Stay where you are. I'm coming to get you. Don't move. Madison, what are you doing here? I really need your help, Hanna. This time I'm desperate. I need you to say that I was with you all afternoon. You've got to give me an alibi. What did you do? He wouldn't stop. He made me do it. I don't know what you're talking about, but you're sounding insane. Just do this last thing and I will delete all of the photos, but if you don't, Hanna, I swear, I will ruin you. No. I am so tired of these stupid threats. I don't want to hurt you, Hanna, but you know that this is your fault. What's your plan, Madison? You gonna kill me? Put the knife down. No, get off of her, Madison. Stop. Let me go! No, no, no, no! Okay, Madison. You should have been my mom. Or you should have been the one who died. No! Madison! Michael: Madison. Madison. Madison, listen to me. I am so sorry. Honey, I failed you. This is all my fault. You don't know. Whatever you did, I will be there beside you. Honey, we can face it together. Please. Please put down the knife. I'm begging you, honey. Please. Put it there. I love you so much. I'm so sorry I haven't been the father you deserved. I was lost in my own grief and I completely shut you out. And I promise I will never do that again. Daddy? I'm sorry, Daddy. Are you sure you want to send it now? I really need to own up to my part in it. I am so proud of you. Hanna Voiceover: Dear Mrs. Mia, in our interview, you gave me the opportunity to explain the story behind a situation I regret. At the time, I had no story. No regrets. But now, if you will allow me to explain, I have both. There's a truth in the saying that everyone is fighting a battle we know nothing about, but through it all, I learned though there may be consequences, there should also be compassion.
