See, Maizy, when someone goes by this dummy jumps out to scare 'em. - Cool. Oh, Levi, this is gonna be the best Halloween harvest ever! Especially since this year, you're my Corn Cob Queen. And you're my Corn Cob King! Guys, it isn't even Halloween yet. Duh, Maizy, we're practicing. Well, don't let anybody see you. It'll spoil the surprise. Hey, who set up that scarecrow? Is that another dummy? - No. That's Cornfield Clem! Get out of my cornfield! We're here. Happy Halloween, everybody. It says here, that the Cobb Corners Halloween harvest festival has become so famous, that families come from all over the state to have a spooky, but safe Halloween. I'm so looking forward to it. Yeah! Like, they make corn on the cob, corn muffins, corn bread, kettle corn and corn dogs. - It's a regular corn-ucopia. - SCOOBY: Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah! Wonder if they've started cooking yet. - Something's up. - Huh? Now, folks, I'm sure there is a reasonable explanation. Reasonable? Cornfield Clem is not reasonable. He's... It's a menace! I say, we cancel everything right now, before someone gets hurt. Who's Cornfield Clem? Local legend? Supernatural creature? Homicidal maniac? Just guessing. Are they really going to shut down the Halloween festival? Eh, yep. Because of a scarecrow? Eh, yep. That's crazy. Eh, yep. My friends, this festival is too important to our community, especially now that the toothpick factory closed down. And I'm sure we can handl this without any more disruptions, isn't that right Sheriff Kern? Well, yes, Mayor Husk. But, if I may add a brief word of caution, - I think... - Thank you, Sheriff, duly noted. Now, let's all dig in and make this the best Halloween festival ever! Dumb 'ol Cornfield Clem! Why'd he have to show up now, when I finally get to be Corn Cob Queen? Maizy, shh, he'll come after us. He already came after us! Excuse me, but can we talk? And here is the house specialty, - pumpkin and cheese pizzas. Like, two of the greatest food groups together. - Right, Scoob? - Uh-huh. Are they like this all the time? No, sometimes they get really hungry. Now, what were you saying about... Cornfield Clem? He's been famous around here for 200 years. It all started wit this old woman, okay? Everybody said she was a witch, so they ran her out of town. Don't let her get away! Very well, then, I shall go. But whilst you may be rid of me, you shall never be rid of my curse! I give you, Cornfield Clem and I vow that he shall make your lives as sorrowful as you have made mine! They say Cornfield Clem comes back every year at harvest time and haunts the town until Halloween. Has that ever happened? Not that we can remember. Which proves that it's just an old legend. Cornfield Clem isn't real. Is this real enough? Well, gang, looks like we have a mystery on our hands. Like, we may need to order more pizza just to calm our nerves. Mm-hmm. Waiter! But, he can't be real. Daphne, it doesn't matter if we think Clem is real, what matters is these folks think he's real. Oh, yeah? Well, we've been a lot more scared than that. Yeah, a lot more. Where'd they get that costume? My guess is, over there. Good eye, Daphne. Well, you know, me and shopping. It looks like a Cornfield Clem convention in there. He is our biggest seller. Do you sell a lot of those masks? Well, Cornfield Clem is a local favorite. By Halloween, I figure a hundred people will be wearing 'em. That won't make our job any easier. By the way, love your mask. What mask? Awkward! What? What did I say? Hello! And welcome to the Cobb Corners Halloween Harvest festival. We'll each have one, please. - One ear? - No, one bushel. With extra butter. Huh? Excuse us, sir. We'd like to go in and search the maze. Mmm, nope. But we have to catch Cornfield Clem. Mm-mmm, nope. Is that all you're gonna say? Eh, yep. Hey, guys. Check this out. - Like, isn't that cool? If you're a garbage disposal. Abner, are these kids giving you a problem? Eh, yep. Sheriff, you have to trust us. We're serious investigators and we have to get into that maze. Look here, pretty boy, that field isn't just full of corn, it's growing a crop of evil, mayhem as high as an elephant's eye. Do you ever go to the movies? Hmm, not often enough. Well, I've seen 'em all. Trust me. Those amber waves of grain are like an ocean stocked with every giant shark, killer piranha and angry blowfish you've ever seen. Blowfish? - But no one's gonna get sliced and diced on my watch. Which is why this cornfield is off limits. Looks like we need a plan "B." We already got our plan "B." - Corn dogs! - Yeah! We knew we could count on you. I saw some tables over here, Scoob. - Ah! Huh? Relax, Scoob, it's just a prop. Oh! Thank you... Oh! That's no prop! That's Cornfield Clem! Run, Scoob! Run! Uh, this might be one of those disruptions you mentioned. Allow us. Fred? Net gun. You've done this before, have you? Uh-huh. Huh, quick, Scoob, in there! Shoot, Fred. Shoot! I'm on it! Like, who's running this run-away hay ride? - Wait! - Hey! - SHAGGY: Like, I don't think this wagon comes with air bags, Scoob! Where are we? Huh? A cemetery? Like this whole night hasn't been scary enough? Let's get out of here! I caught you, you miserable thieves! Who? Us? Are you guys all right? Yeah, except this dude thinks we stole something. My shovels, my tool box, everything but this old pickaxe. All taken by some tall, skinny fellow like you. Who is skinny? This is all muscle! How long ago were your tools taken? Been happening all week. We just got into town today, Shaggy couldn't have done it. Oh! Well, then I guess we can bury the hatchet. "Bury"? Get it? Hey, that's a little graveyard humor. Good one. Don't worry, sir. I bet when we solve the Cornfield Clem mystery, we'll find out who's been stealing from you, too. Did you notice? The cemetery stretches all the way back to the cornfield. - Which means... - That Cornfield Clem may have more on his mind than scaring people. Creepy. Folks, we have to face the facts. Thanks to the catastrophe visited upon us by Cornfield Clem, and by some of our guests... Uh... I must reluctantly, as your Mayor, cancel the rest of the festival. No... And since it's clear tha the local authorities cannot keep us safe... Said Mayor Pass-the-buck. I also recommend you parents keep your kids indoors this Halloween. - BOY: Oh, no! Then what? How long are we supposed to be prisoners in our own homes? Dwayne, you know as well as I do. The day after Halloween, we harvest the corn and mow the field flat. After that we can only hop that Cornfield Clem will leave us alone, at least for a year. But if the festival's off, I won't get to be Corn Cob Queen! Well, she sure has her priorities straight. Right, Fred? Huh? Oh, yeah, right. One more thing, make sure no one gets near that cornfield tonight. - You can count on that, sir. - Good. 'Cause this is the second calamity in a year. And if you don't do any better this time around, I will have your badge. What'd he mean, "second calamity"? Well, the fact is, some months ago we had a bank robbery here in town. SCOOBY-DOO: Robbers? For reals? For reals? Yes, we think it was a one-man job. County payroll was in the safe, so there was lots of cash. - I set up road blocks, checkpoints, the whole kit and caboodle. I found the getaway car, empty. There was too much money to carry, so he didn't run off with it but I never found him or the cash. The car, was it near the cornfield? I suppose it was. Why am I not surprised? Abner, there you are, set up some barriers. Nobody is getting into that cornfield tonight. Is that clear? Eh, yep. Hey, like not all the news is bad. There's a candy corn factory one town over, and they give tours! Sorry, but there's only one place we're going tonight, and that's in the maze, to find Cornfield Clem. Did we mention, free samples? Mmm... Uh... Oh! Kids, get away from the window. The Mayor said Halloween was canceled. - Stupid scarecrow. Let's go. Can Scooby-Doo and I just stand guard? Please? - Ow! This map Maizy gave me will get us where we need to go. And where is that? Where the scarecrow is working. Uh, working on what? A better personality? Note to self. Don't wear high heels in a corn field. My shoes aren't the problem. There's a hole. And another. Cornfield Clem has been digging. Digging for wh... Shaggy? Like what's he digging for? China? Looks like he found what he was after. Uh-oh! What do you hear, Scoob? Where to now, Scooby? Hmm. I think we found him. You mean like, he found us! Spread out! Run! The balloon from the festival! Hmm. Hey! I know this row. Scoob! Jump! Ha! He missed us! Huh? Shoot, Fred, shoot! On it! Huh? I was on the road when I saw that combine... - Is that Cornfield Clem? - Yes. Or to be more precise, Abner, your hired hand. - I can't believe it. - It's him all right. The first thing we noticed was that his hands weren't calloused like a farm worker's, but soft and smooth like a safe cracker's. Sheriff, those roadblocks you set up did stop him from driving out of town after he robbed the bank. You forced him to bury the cash in an open field. He figured he'd come back an get it once the heat was off What he didn't realize was that the field was just planted with corn. When he came back, he couldn't see where he buried the money. Imagine his panic when he searched the field and had no idea where to dig! He needed time to figure it out. That's when he realized, he could use the Halloween Harvest to his advantage. That's why he dressed u like Cornfield Clem, so he could frighten folks away and work in secret. He added arm extensions to make his scarecrow even scarier. Get up. All he had to do was dig up the money before they cut down the corn after Halloween. Yep. And I would have gotten away with it too, if it weren't for you meddling kids and your spooky old dog! Eh, yep! Well, gang, looks like we've solved another mystery. Yeah, like except for one, where's Scoob? Mm-mmm. Trick or treat! Scooby-dooby-doo!
