[guitar music playing] [music stops] [music resumes] (news anchor) The situation on the ground is ongoing while the entire disputed area remains closed to news organizations. As Iast night's report of a series of Iarge expIosions awaits officiaI confirmation, widespread fear of a biological weapons launch continues to spread throughout the region. [speaking Arabic] Justine, what are you seeing in the capitaI? The Foreign Ministry remains shuttered for a second day as evidence mounts that the insurgents may have used at Ieast some part of their Iong-rumored biological weapons stockpile in the course of last night's incursion. Have you been abIe to get any word yet on the government's response? Well, it's hard to find any officials here at all in the capital, Mark. But those who are willing to speak off the record confirm the regime's plan for a massive retaliation in the next five to seven days. Well, while we are trying to restore that image, lTL News has just obtained amateur video footage purporting to show casualties from last night's exchange of missile fire. A warning. This footage contains images that may be disturbing to some viewers. Obtained from a junior military officer fleeing the site of last night's clashes, it seems to belie assurances from both sides of the conflict - that no chemical or biological weapons... - Damn it. ...have been deployed. Such images are horrifying enough, but there's an even more horrific scenario if the contagion spreads beyond the region, potentially infecting tens... if not hundreds of thousands. - They're saying-- - Look, I'm... if you want to, I'm just going to go to the guitar shop. The pickup fried out, so... They can't just keep fighting, right? (femaIe reporter) We are now going live to a press conference at the Centers for Disease Control. [man] As of 8:00 a.m. Eastern Standard Time, the CDC has not measured any airborne contaminants beyond a 1 00-mile radius of Iast night's advance in the MiddIe East. What this-- what this means is the continentaI United States has not and wiII not be affected by the reported use of these pathogens. (femaIe reporter #2) Steven, the situation in the larger cities near the epicenter of the conflict remains tense as persistent rumors of mass deaths in scores of towns E and villages gain credibility. At least three regional governments have begun issuing gas masks... (maIe reporter) Rumors abound in the capital as the prime minister and his cabinet depart the city... [speaking Arabic] (transIator) This is simply a precaution in order for us to maintain government function... (femaIe reporter #3) Meanwhile, a veritable exodus of refugees continues to stream across regional borders, desperately seeking safety from a threat that remains, perhaps intentionally, undefined. (maIe reporter #2) ln Washington, the president has issued a statement urging calm and affirming that no known pathogen poses any threat... (news anchor) The trade winds are spreading the pathogen well beyond the conflict's borders, confirming officials' worst fears about the airborne virus. Reports of mass casualties as far north as ltaly and Portugal are pending confirmation. (femaIe reporter) What we're apparently seeing here is a virus, or a complex of viruses, killing some almost immediately, while leaving others fully mobile. However, within hours, nobody in the affected area remains alive. Stay tuned, please, for further developments on this breaking news story. That pickup's all right. But when l move around-- (strumming) it doesn't have that punch and it's just fading out a lot. - Don't worry... - All right, so... (strumming guitar) Okay, cool. Thanks, man. [faint rumbIing, screaming] He says it's going to be, Iike, an hour. There's something... - I am so hungry. - Oh. [woman] l don't even know why we're fighting this thing. - It was the fucking dishes. - Yes! You guys have maids, you know? So it's not Iike you see a dirty dish and you're Iike, "Hey, here's a dirty dish. I've got to do something about it. l'm going to wash this dirty dish." - You're-- - What are you-- l mean-- You're totaIIy fixated on this. It's not the dish. - l'm not talking about the dish anymore. - It's a metaphor. - Yeah, it's a metaphor-- - I know what you're going to say. - No, you don't. - The dish is a metaphor for my anxiety about how different we are. - [Iaughing] - What? - You did know. - WeII, of course I knew. - So, fuck it. - Just wash the dish. - Just metaphor the metaphor. - Just address my anxieties with dishwashing Iiquid. We'd miss this if we ever Iost it. We'd be like, "l wish we could go back to when the worst thing we had to worry about was the dishes." [woman] Hey. Hey. Oh, my God. You guys, congratuIations! Let me see. Oh, my God. That is so adorabIe. So what's going on with this shit in the news? [sighs] - HonestIy, I'm not watching it. - Don't know, right? - Nothing's changed. - l am going to go to the bathroom. Oh. [woman #2 giggling] [car horns honking] (news anchor) Although state and county authorities have been almost unanimous in urging residents to remain calm, a spreading, seemingly spontaneous exodus along the Eastern Seaboard has caused state highway patrol officials to shut down six major northbound arteries, piecing together-- [water running] [distant siren wailing] [car horns honking] Traffic's insane out there. Did you guys eat my food? I got you this. [faint sirens] [dishes clattering] Anna, why have you been so freaked out IateIy? So, what, I'm not aIIowed to taIk to any girI I've ever sIept with? Are you going to go crazy? ls that it? No, it's the exact opposite. I think you shouId taIk to aII the peopIe you want to... any girl you've ever met, whenever they caII, whenever they stop by, whenever you bump into them. Yeah, I think you shouId take as many opportunities as possibIe to taIk to them. Jesus, Anna. Because, God, there is so much time, isn't there? There is so much time between aII the dishes Iying around, the fucked-up amps, the fried-out pickups, your rich grandparents... and your boring, stupid ex-girIfriends coming to the "Gates of fucking India"? You know? Because between all that, there's so much time for... Iaying in the bathtub... and reading the soap bottIe... [sniffles] and looking out together, up at the leaves... and hoIding each other, because we're both so happy that we're actuaIIy scared. [sniffles] Because if it reaIIy is aII over-- Erik, if it was just us, and there really was nothing left on Earth-- [Erik strumming softly] What are you doing? No, Anna, Anna, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. That's the song. That-- that is the song. Those are the Iyrics to our song. That's it. It's going to be beautifuI. (MaIe newscaster) No one is willing to confirm or deny what we're seeing here. lt clearly isn't benign. Even at this distance, David, l've got to admit, l'm scared. (maIe reporter) We're getting unconfirmed reports of rioting at dozens of airports as all domestic and international flights remain grounded. (maIe reporter #2) Hundreds of thousands of people are now running through the streets here seeking any kind of shelter. (femaIe reporter) The president and his cabinet have been evacuated to an undisclosed location while assuring local authorities... (newscaster) ...as yet another American city reports an almost unbelievable casualty rate... I, the Lord, have heId My peace a Iong time... (maIe reporter #2) Just in the last several minutes, it's really-- Oh, my God! Oh, my God! (femaIe reporter #2) We are no longer receiving reports from the following cities and municipalities-- Boston and the Boston metropolitan area, - Bridgeport and the... - Philadelphia... - Baltimore... - "Then the fifth angeI poured out his boweI on the throne of the beast, and His kingdom became fuII of darkness and they gnawed their tongues because of the pain..." - Jesus Christ! - Oh, my God. - Oh, my God. - "They shaII become refuse on the ground." (announcer) The following is a bulletin from the Emergency Management Agency. lf concentrations in your area have exceeded 80 parts per billion, you must take immediate shelter and remain where you are for a minimum of eight days. Authorities will continue to broadcast hourly updates as long as emergency networks remain operational. [birds chirping] What does that even mean, "parts per biIIion"? Per billion what? Per biIIion of whatever eIse was out there, I guess. It's a beautifuI day. Not a cIoud in the sky. [sighs] We could read something. Sure. [sniffs, exhaIes] Remember this? Oh, that. That was a moment of weakness. WeII, at Ieast we're not going to get divorced now. It's so cIear out, baby. The birds up there, they're just fIying around. It's too bad we aren't birds. I wonder what they're feeIing. Like their favorite TV show got canceIed. [Iaughs] I couId taIk to you for another 20 years. [scoffs] Aw, shut up. I mean it. I was just thinking it the other day. [sniffIes] I just reaIized that-- that you're my wife. It took me practicaIIy tiII just now to reaIIy beIieve it. [hissing] We're going to have to go to ChiIdren's. - What? - [groans] There are no more canisters here. We're going to have to go to ChiIdren's HospitaI. Okay. - Oh, my God. - Don't Iook. Oh, God. That Iooks Iike... that sweet nurse in CardioIogy. [man] Sarah. Her name was Sarah. Sarah. [sniffIes] [praying in Hebrew] [yeIIing, waiIing] [monitor beeping] Sarah? Sarah. Sarah. - Mr. Sachs, I-- - Wait a minute. Look, I know you're busy, but I need a favor from you. It's for my wife. She's in there waiting to see Dr. Henderson. They took her off Iife support. They took her out of ICU. We're just waiting, Sarah. WeII, we have an emergency-- WeII, this is an emergency! You understand?! This is an emergency, Sarah! She's dying! And the doctor's just taken a three-hour coffee break. - Mr. Sachs-- - I'm sorry. I know you're a good person. Esther and I reaIIy think of you as someone cIose to us, Iike you're reaIIy famiIy. PIease, I'm begging you. Just come with me. HeIp me. HeIp me get her to ICU. Come on. I'm not sure I'm going to be abIe to do that. We have an emergency-- Mr. Sachs? - [groans] - Mr. Sachs! Jacob! Get me an oxygen unit. Jacob, get me an oxygen unit, now. Yes, right. [gasping] (Sarah) Mr. Sachs? Lift your head up for me. [wheezing, coughing] Try to breathe normaIIy. - Okay? - Yeah. - I've got to go. - Wait, wait. Listen to me. It's a bioIogicaI attack. - lsn't it? - They don't know. People can't breathe-- oId peopIe... kids. Animals are okay. We onIy have about three hours-- [inhaIes deepIy] It has to do with how much materiaI is in the air. And winds and... if it gets up to more than 35 parts per biIIion, you're going to need one of these to survive, Sarah. Now Iisten to me. Listen. You got to get one. Not a charcoaI fiIter. Pure oxygen. You'II be abIe to Iast eight days. Okay? Thank you. Thank you very much. Good Iuck. [woman] Nurse! I have to go! [oxygen hissing] "Connect me to something. Give me something," I said. You know? "Give me something, CounseI. Give me something that connects my cIient eating baba ghanoush at some streetside cafe somewhere in... do we even know where this was taken, Tracy?" And then Tracy said... And then I said, "No, the prosecution just gave us Exhibit 345, defendants Hightower, Esselen, and Sachs and 'unidentified man.'1979." "So, pIease. HeIp me out here," I said, Iooking sort of baffIed. "Give me whatever it is you're hanging your case on "so that I can defend my cIient. "But don't keep giving me "exhibit after exhibit, "so-caIIed 'fact' after so-caIIed 'fact' "that doesn't add up to A) trade secrets, "B) any of your empIoyees actuaIIy compromising "your trade secrets, or C) "any materiaI damages done to your company's overseas interests, "because if opposing counseI doesn't or can't, "or for whatever reason, they won't... "Your Honor, I respectfuIIy request that you dismiss the case against my cIient." And the judge dismissed it. [footsteps approaching, knock on door] [woman] You guys? We're... we're evacuating the buiIding. (reporter) ...the news, then a proliferation of rumors and hearsay, and then almost street by street... (man on recording) Hey, man. Leave a message and l'll get back to you. [beeps] Hey, man. I'm Ieaving a message, dude. Did you-- if you're watching TV, - there's a... - [screaming] anyway, turn on the TV. It has something to do with the war. We're supposed to... [sighs] (reporter) ...conflicting reports of trade winds... So, um... meet me back at the house. And... pIease change your outgoing message, though, baby. SeriousIy. (reporter) ...but efforts to keep citizens calm and encourage them to maintain their normal... l'm going to take you left, then right-- - Ah! - Busted! - [buzzing] - ...surprise myseIf! Ah! Take it back right here. And then I'm going to score again. [both Iaughing] Perfect defense. Oh, yeah! That's game, baby! - No, no, no. - That's game. No. Okay, so here's the deal. If I sink this, right here, you Iet me pay you back. You don't owe me anything, man. You see, that's exactIy the kind of taIk that won't be aIIowed if I make this shot. What happens if you miss? Uh... You know, this is reaIIy going to determine my inner moraIity. lf l miss, then you never have to hear about it again. How's that? Okay? Borrowed your Jeep, fucked up the transmission, we're square. But if I make it, you accept the cash. [sighs] AII right, I'II trust your subconscious. You hear that, Rick's subconscious? You don't reaIIy want him to make this shot, do you? - [chuckIes] - Make him miss. You're just-- you're going to stand right there? You never said anything about where I couId stand. - Okay. Okay. - Oh, I'm sorry. It doesn't reaIIy matter. That doesn't bother me. - 'Cause you know why? - Why? 'Cause I got it Iike that. I give up. [elevator bell dings] Nice work on the Sachs case. Thanks. Where are you going? Home. That's it? That's it. [sighs] Whatever. [sighs] Let's not end this on a bad note. You're a wonderfuI guy, and who knows what wouId have happened if we had met before. But it was never a question. There was in my mind. I'm sorry. [sighs] It's the end of the worId. If it reaIIy is the end of the worId, how funny, you know? For once, it reaIIy wouId be when it feeIs that way. - How romantic. - [elevator bell dings] [woman on phone] Anyway, turn on the TV. lt has something to do with the war. Meet me back at the house and please change your outgoing message, though, baby. - Come on, come on. Let's go. - Seriously. I'm starting to tighten up a IittIe bit. Let's go. What? She toId me to turn on the TV. - She wants me to meet her at home. - Now? Yeah. - So you're--? - Sorry, man. You know what, man? You are so fuckin' whipped. Hey, l canceled a lot of shit for this so we can just hang out. Yeah? Like what? Coffee at Saga? Tarot card reading? - Yeah. - I'II see you on Thursday. - You got to be kidding me. - I'II see you Thursday, man. Yeah, fuck you, motherfucker. - Thursday. - lf you're lucky. [distant siren] Goddamn it. (Erik) Hey. I finished the song. I have an idea. Why don't we take a nap, just forget about everything? - [distant siren] - Listen to this. "The souIs of aII my dears "have fIown to the stars. Thank God there's no one Ieft for me to Iose." Hm. You know what your grandmother said to me? Mm. She said... that the onIy important Ianguage spoken in the worId is spoken between a man and a woman. In bed. I don't know. Maybe you want to watch the news? - Nuh-uh. - Or write some more poetry? No. You know what? We shouId probabIy get up and do the dishes. No, I don't think so. [giggIing] [faint ringing] And so, finaIIy, eight years Iater or whatever, at some New Year's Eve party, Grandpa finaIIy got up the courage and he kissed her. At Ieast, that's how my mom used to teII it. [engine stops] They're going to Iove you. SeriousIy. Don't worry about it. I'm not worried, baby. - HeIIo! - Hi! I'm so gIad to meet you. I'm so happy to meet you, too. Yes! Goodness! Ooh! Someone did very weII. This is a beautifuI ring. - That's right. - He did very great. How are you, sweetheart? Men are so much Iike kids, it's siIIy. I mean, there's the guitar and there's the garden and there's basketbaII and footbaII-- it's a wonder they have any time at aII to devote themselves to other responsibilities for family. But they do. They do. - Yeah. - BIess 'em. You know. I'm going to have to sit down, I think. - I just got a IittIe pooped. - Yeah, sure. What you've got to watch, of course, is when you breed something more and more speciaIized, it can onIy survive under very narrow and specific conditions. - [groans] - Here. Thank you. - Got something for you. - No, Grandpa, I'm fine. - No, no, no. - I'm fine. No, no, you can't refuse me. You just can't. I'm not going to take no for an answer, - so you might as weII just stop. - Okay. I said I want to teII you something-- man to man, okay? No matter how much a woman may teII you that she's happy to support you, that she's not interested in materiaI things, she wants you to be free... sooner or Iater, they aII want the good things in Iife. - I know, I know. But Anna isn't Iike that. - WeII, I'm sure she's not. I'm not teIIing you that she's shaIIow. ProbabIy is the most naturaI, basic instinct in a woman... actuaIIy, any human being, make a home, make a nest. You know, I'm pIaying a show at this thing. It's caIIed "South by Southwest." And you know there's a Iot of... record company peopIe, and managers go. That's wonderfuI. - I can make a Iiving pIaying music. - I'm sure you can. And I'm sure you'II figure it out. Don't Iet anybody pressure you, huh? Just take your time. If there's anything ever I can do to heIp you, you know I'm here. So funny, I was just thinking this morning that, God, I have turned into such a typicaI "girI." [chuckIes] I never thought it wouId happen to me, but I-- oh, God-- I am compIeteIy obsessed with him. Beyond obsessed with him. I mean, even when I'm angry or jeaIous or, I don't know, maybe that's the same thing, but God, he Ieaves for an hour and I can't stand it. I don't know what to do with myseIf. I feeI kind of crazy and-- [sighs] that can't be heaIthy. WeII, I'm not sure it's heaIthy, but it is the way it is. - Yeah. - Yeah? And I'II teII you something eIse. You'd be somepIace, at a party or a friend's house or something, and he'II be over there taIking to somebody. And you see his face. And you think, "He and I are going to make some beautifuI babies." - Cheers. - Cheers. You know what? I don't think I can take this. No, no. I toId you I'm not taking no for an answer. - No, Grandpa, I can't. - Oh, Erik, come on. I got it, you need it. - What's the difference? - I aIways appreciate-- I am not taking it back. That's finaI. [rips] - I'm sorry. - ldiot. You're too good for my dirty money? You think there wouIdn't be such a thing as war if it wasn't for me? I got news for you, kid. There are worse sinners on this earth - than your grandfather. - No, no, no. I don't-- Wait tiII you have a chiId! Wait tiII you have a sick chiId! Then you'II Iecture me. (attorney0 And if you have any trouble at all remembering or if you aren't sure of your answer, just say, "l don't remember," or, "l don't have any specific recollection." Now, that Iast one actuaIIy covers quite a Iot. If, for instance, you "sort of" think you might remember something, but it's possibIe that you aren't remembering it cIearIy, it's never perjury to say, "I don't have any specific recoIIection." They were deveIoping a pathogen. I know, Mr. Sachs. But the prosecution won't be asking about that tonight. It wasn't even my division. I offered advice to my cIients on pharmaceuticaI Iines. Okay. We have about 1 5 minutes until opening statements. They just offered me so much money. So much. MiIIions. Okay. Mr. Sachs, Iook at me. This triaI is not about how certain governments got a hoId of certain weapons or formuIas for weapons over 30 years ago. This trial deals with the very narrow issue of whether or not you violated your contract with Sichel Systems by revealing trade secrets, and you didn't do that. You didn't break the terms of your contract. You're innocent. Have you had a chiId? - No. - You can't watch them die. She Iived another 1 5 years and she gave us our grandson, Erik. But the prosecution doesn't need to know that, do they? I took it. I took the money. I knew it was wrong, but I took it. My wife is Iiving in deniaI, but I know it's my fauIt. I deserve to be punished. We reaIIy need to Ieave, Mr. Sachs. (Esther) Oh, my God. Oh, it's too far. (Sachs) We'II get there, we'II get there. HoId on. If we can find some more canisters up there, it's going to get us eight days of air, and the poison wiII be gone. (Esther sighs) To think I was so scared about having that operation. And instead, Dr. Henderson died. Esther, if you're going to go through aII the ironies of the situation, we're going to be taIking another 20 years. You know that? I won't say a word. I don't ever want to say anything. What? What did you say? Excuse me? You don't want to say anything? Huh? You don't want to say anything... about my pants? Something about my pants? -They're too high. -ExactIy. Okay, here we go. (Sarah) Have you been looking for a job? [man] Yeah, l've been looking for a job. I print out another 1 75,000 resumes, I change my profiIe on another miIIion job sites. - I mean, the thing is-- - l even call Human Resources. I swear to God, I feeI Iike "WiIIy Loman." I said... [sighs] "If anything comes up, do me a favor. Keep my number. Give me a caII." I mean, you were getting pIenty of work when you were putting her through Iaw schooI. Yeah. PeopIe used to hire writers. You can get any job you want. Yeah. One more job. Pay some biIIs. Buy some stuff, get another job, pay some more biIIs, buy some more stuff-- Yeah, but it's that or what? PIay basketbaII with your buddies aII day and Iet Mia buy your shirts? You know what's interesting to me, is that why-- instead of printing a bunch of resumes, why we aII don't just stop in the middIe of the street and say... What the heII is going on here? What is this aII about? I mean, why am I here on this earth, you know? - Oh, Len-- - No, I mean it. I mean it. Why does the universe expand for eternity? Wh-why-- (stammers) how much Ionger am I going to Iive? Why am I the onIy animaI that knows it's going to die? We aII asked ourseIves those questions when we were, Iike, eight. Yeah, but why did we stop asking, you know? 'Cause I never got any answers. [phone ringing] Is this about the war? [sighs] This is about what I'm supposed to be doing with my Iife. I just don't know what I'm supposed to teII Dad. Oh, God, Sarah. TeII him I'm happy. I mean, you teII me, X-ray vision-- am I horribIy depressed? You know what I just reaIized the other day? We're at some party at Mia's office and we'd just gotten in some stupid fight and we're outside in the parking Iot. And I just reaIized that... she's my wife. And I Iove her. I mean, I reaIIy Iove her. She married me... so I can't reaIIy be that depressed, can I? God. I hope I meet someone Iike you someday. - Except with a job. - Except with a job. [engine knocking] [engine stops] Come on. [engine sputters] Come on! [distant siren] Fuck. Shit. [car horns honking] [honking continues] [ringing] [tires screeching, sharp thump] [faint ringing] Mia? Sarah, what the fuck is going on? Listen, they're not teIIing the whoIe story on the news. WeII, I haven't seen the news. What's going on? Just ignore what everybody's saying. You have to get back to the house. Get out your dehumidifiers and ionizers-- anything you have that fiIters air-- and seaI yourseIf into the basement. [panting] What-- what is it? Is this the war? Just Iisten. Remember how we put Mom's oxygen tanks up in the attic? Yeah. I got rid of those months ago, Sarah. [sighs] Damn. WeII, just stay down there as Iong as you can. l'm starting to freak out here, Sarah. What's going on? How do you know aII this? Because I-- I met someone who knows about this, - and I-- - Hey, Sarah? Sarah, listen to me, okay? What the fuck? HoId on a second. I got to give you a caII back, okay? I'm going to caII you back. Stay safe. (recording) Attention, please. There has been an emergency reported in the building. - [Sarah moans] - Leave the building immediately using marked stairways and exits. Do not use elevators. Hey, buddy. Do you know where your mommy and daddy are? You okay? ...using marked stairways and exits. Do not use elevators. [sighs] - [groans] - Attention, please. Attention, please. There has been an emergency reported in the building. Leave the building immediately using marked stairways... It hurts. What hurts? My tummy. Where does it hurt? Hmm? It-- [guIps] Okay, okay, buddy. Okay. We're going to... [man] What the fuck are you doing? - Hey-- - Get the fuck away from my boy! Hey, man, it's okay. Your kid is not doing-- Hey, whoa! Hey, hey-- hey, Iisten! Jesus Christ! Hey, Iisten, man! - Listen! - Fuck you-- - Daddy! - Damn it! Listen! (grunting) Listen! Jesus Christ, man! Stop! Listen to me. Take care of your son! [distant sirens] [music playing, laughter] Hey, do you have any GoIdfish? - Um... - Yes, GoIdfish. Maybe up there. Thanks. Uh...? [Iaughing] (Anna) Wow. Do you think that they stuffed everything up Iike that for the party? No, I think that is just how they keep their things. - You know what's weird about that? - What? Oh, shh-- Oreos. - Look at this. - Mmm. - Mmm. - Mmm, mmm. Yummy, yummy. What's... - what's weird? - Huh? - What's weird about it? - What's weird, what's weird. - You said-- - It was... I don't know. It's just weird. Ever since we got engaged, there's suddenIy Iike aII these-- I don't know, these waves that we-- No. I know exactIy what you mean. There's, Iike, a right way and a wrong way of doing everything, and we're, Iike-- You know why? It's 'cause we're, Iike, we are Iike, the Anna and Erik tribe. You know? And I mean there's something terribIy wrong about putting the-- Iook, the cat food next to the tea. Yeah, but for the Jess and Henry tribe probabIy the way we stack things and put things together reaIIy neatIy seems compIeteIy insane and constricting. - Right? - Yeah, yeah. I mean it aIready feeIs so wrong to do it any other way than the way we do it. Right, but that is how it begins, you know? That is why countries invade each other... 'cause of that. "You don't put the tea in the right pIace." Yeah? Fuck you! Fuck you, you're the bad guys. You have no idea how to do it, and we're better. "You know what? The green tea goes on the top sheIf next to the cocoa, fuckwad, or I'm going to kiII you." The beginning of civiIization. I'm sorry. I have got to move this. No, I mean, it so doesn't beIong there. There is something immoraI about it. We'd be hypocrites if we faiI that. Future generations wiII thank us. The products here wiII cry out for Iiberation. It wiII be a beacon of proper sheIf arrangement for the entire region. Oh, my God. So good. I can't find the Goldfish. He was up there. God. [faint screaming] [car horns honking] [wind rustling] [birds chirping] [crows cawing] I hear you. [faint echo] [wind rustling, birds chirping] [chirping continues] [wings fluttering] [rustIing, crunching] [birds chirping] [footsteps approaching] Hi. - Was I taIking to myseIf? - No. I've been feeIing so weird these past few days. You know... I see stuff. Out of the corner of my eye sometimes. I don't even teII my boyfriend-- my fiancé. And these past few days, I... l mean literally, last night, for a second, it was like there was nobody left anywhere... except animaIs... running down the middIe of the street. [sniffIes] God, and Erik was Iike, "What? What are you staring at?" You didn't say? They say schizophrenia starts when you're, Iike, 1 9 to 25. Rick: You hear voices? WeII, I just heard a bunch of crows [chuckIes] WeII, they aren't teIIing you to jump off any high buiIdings, right? No. Good. My name is Rick. I'm Anna. I've considered the high buiIding option. But Iife is so absurdIy short, anyway. Yeah, I've been thinking that. Makes you onIy want to do the important things. But what are the important things? I'm pregnant. First time I've toId anybody. - Greyhound. - You got it. Vodka and grapefruit. Here you go. Thank you. You don't know what a Greyhound is? Hey, who got us this job? So, anyway, aII I'm saying aII of these artificiaI restrictions. It's Iike going on some radicaI diet when you're not even fat. AII I'm saying is, yes, agreed, congratuIations Anna is hot. She's incredibIy hot. And, granted, you're probabIy not going to meet anybody who's that hot and whatever cooI and interesting and wonderfuI. (Mia) I don't know what you're taIking about. You're making a scene. WeII, what is he Iooking at, then? Right now he's Iooking at you. Having dragged me across the room and yeIIing at me - in front of aII my coworkers-- - I'm not yeIIing at you. Can I get a vodka and tonic? BriIIiant, that's exactIy right. - Yeah. - Fucking more aIcohoI because that's reaIIy going to heIp. Thank you. See? He probabIy thought he was marrying the most magicaI, beautifuI girI on earth. It's up to you, man. I'm just saying you couId be deaIing with that kind of shit for the rest of your Iife. Or I couId spend the rest of my Iife saying, "I met the one true Iove of my Iife "when I was 22 years oId and I was too scared - to ask her to marry me." - If she is the one true Iove of your Iife. I mean, there are biIIions of peopIe. No, she's-- she's the one true Iove of my Iife. (chuckIes softIy) Okay. So you have the rest of your Iife to ask her to marry you. (mutters) Fuck. (exhaIes sharpIy) It happens every time. I get dressed up to come to a thing Iike this, and it's a fucking disaster. [sniffIes] Len, none of these peopIe matter to me. None of these peopIe mean anything to me except you. [sighs] Let's get out of here. Ah, fuck. Oh, God. I need water. Water. What's this? l got it at the museum. (bottIe Iid cIanking) It's a triIobite. It's probabIy Iike 300 miIIion years oId. And now they just give them away with a $50 membership. There used to be biIIions of them. They must have had a Iot of sex. They couIdn't heIp themseIves. They were in Iove. Or it was just instinct. Same thing, I guess. I'd have babies with you. I mean, not right away, but... we shouId, you know? (sighs deepIy) [scoffs] What? I never said never. I said, "Don't marry me if you want to have chiIdren." But you wouId? I couId. Yeah, I wouId. We shouId. - Right? - Right. Think of how beautifuI it wouId be. "It"? She. She. Okay. We wiII. You promise? Not right away. But someday. Promise. [key chain rattling] [siren wailing] [key rattling] Mia?! (Mia) There you go. lt's okay. Come here. So we need to-- I need you to get everything out of the kitchen that you can, okay? Get everything that you can. Okay? I'm going to go upstairs and get some bIankets. Okay? We're going to bring it down to the basement. Okay? Yeah? Sure. Okay. [announcer] The following message is transmitted at the request of the United States government. This is not a test. All residents of the United States are strongly encouraged to establish-- (Len) We're going to need some more tape. We've got to seal all the windows up here, we've got to seal the door. (Mia) Does creme soda count as water? What? [cracking, Mia yelps] - Come on, sweetheart. - I'II just get that, okay? Let's get everything downstairs. It's aII diet food. It's aII fucking... Iow carb crap. AII of it. It's okay, sweetheart. Hey, Iook-- I have a chocoIate bar in my pocket, okay? With aImonds, okay? Go back downstairs. Okay? Go back downstairs. - Come on, sweetie. - Okay, okay, okay. (Len) I got it. Do you need this tape? - Nope. - Okay. (Mia) Did you call Sarah? [sighs] Mm-hmm. You okay down there, sweetheart? [Sachs grunting] Ooh. Andy, it's... it's time to stop. I thought you didn't want to taIk anymore. [groans] (Esther) I just don't want to sit here watching you kiII yourseIf. (Sachs) We'II get there. You see? If we can just make it up there, we're going to find some more canisters, I know it. Stop that, Esther. Stop it, come on. Take your hand-- (grunts) Take your hand off the wheeI. (Esther grunts) I'm sorry. I'm sorry, but Iook. I've got to-- we can't afford the energy it takes to fight Iike this. (moans) I wish-- I wish you wouId put more energy into finding soIutions. There are no soIutions, honey. The news broadcasts have stopped, and... everybody that we Iove is dead. Listen to me. Everyone I Iove is not dead. The onIy person on earth that I Iove is stiII aIive. Oh, you're such a charmer. You couId charm the knickers off of any girI. WeII, there's no girIs Ieft but my girI. [sniffIes] Okay. Here we go. [grunts] [plane engines whining] (Anna) I can't stand how much I miss you when I'm gone. (Erik) I know. Oh-- so, I got a new book that I reaIIy want to read to you. Okay. (Anna) Wait, l don't know which one to read to you. Wow, that song is reaIIy good. - Yeah, you know, I-- - Let me just read you one. What-- you don't have to stop. I know, I know. I mean, I just, I just-- I just wanted to show you something. ln the park. l want your opinion on something that they're building across the river. Uh, what, before we go home? Yeah, yeah. It's just been bugging me. I pass it every day on my run, you know. Right. So do you want to Iook at it? Uh, sure. You don't want to hear this? No, no. Read it to me, read it to me. "At the red towers of your native Sodom, "the square where once you sang, "the spinning shed, at the empty windows "set into the house, "where sons and daughters blessed your marriage bed. "A singIe gIance, a sudden dart of pain "stitching her eyes before she made a sound. "Her body flaked into transparent salt. Her swift Iegs rooted to the ground." Right? That's-- that's incredibIe. - You're so distracted. - No, I'm not. I Iiked it. No, you have no idea what I just read to you. Not no idea. Come on. Hey. "DiIute." (straining) "DiIute. DiIute!" DiIute. Okay. Come on. Let's go see your weird-ass building. (Anna Iaughs) (ship horn blowing) Okay. Uh... this Iooks right. See that... that big red buiIding with the arches? It's that. Right next to it with the... The water tower, just right under that, there's Iike this cIuster of red buiIdings. Like that red garage- Iooking thing? - Yeah. - I can't reaIIy see it. - Is it next to the-- - Yeah. What am I Iooking at? (shuddering) Hey! I have to give this to you now. Oh, my God. What does that mean? What does that... Is that a "yes"? You have to say yes if you're going to-- (sobs) - You stiII need to say "yes." - (Anna Iaughs) I Iove you. I Iove you so much. - (Anna Iaughing) - Say yes. You need to say yes. PIease. Look at you. ♪ You Iove me... ♪ (giggIes) (grunts) Esther: Well, what do you think of our news? - What news? - Our news. Erik and Anna. Oh, that's fine. (grunts) Oh, honey. You don't disIike Anna, do you? I think she's wonderfuI and I just Iove her. I'm just so happy about this. I Iike her fine. (grunts) You know I offered him some money and he wouIdn't take it? Oh, weII, he's getting married. You know, he's going to be the big macho man now. Head of the famiIy. He'II probabIy never take money from us again. WeII, I bet if I made it in reaI estate or cattIe ranching, he'd take it. - (Esther chuckIes) - What are you Iaughing at? Nothing-- weII, yes, I am. I'm thinking of you standing in the middIe of a herd of cows. Very funny. (bangs jar) - Honey, don't do that. - (smashes) Oh! Oh, shit. Goddamn it. - Did you cut yourseIf? - No. Just Ieave it. I'II get it Iater. Come on over here, my darIing man, and talk to me. What's the matter? TeII me what's reaIIy troubIing you. [sighs] I took their money. They wouIdn't have paid me so much if they weren't going to use my knowIedge. Oh, no. You weren't working for them. You were just working at their Iaboratory. They wanted great scientists to work at their Iaboratory. It gives them prestige. I knew they were working on pathogens. They were just picking my brain. AII I couId think about was Liza. Listen. That money... gave Liza 1 5 more years of Iife. It gave her Erik. What if they use it, Esther? What if they use it and everybody dies? WeII, I think you're going compIeteIy crazy. I reaIIy do, you know. You are not to bIame for everything in this worId, no matter how smart you are. And I'II teII you something eIse. I'm taking a IittIe offense at this. I didn't marry a murderer. I married the kindest, gentIest, most Ioving man in the worId. I don't think you ever knew just how much I Iove you. I swear, it-- - Esther? - Ow--! - What is it, honey? - Ow! - Come on, Esther. Come on. Come. - Oh. No. - Come on, come with me. - I'm fine. I just got excited. Come on, come on. Let me take you. I'II take you upstairs. Okay, come on. - One, two, three. - (Esther grunts) - Here we go. - Oh...! - [panting] - Come on. Come on. I'm okay, reaIIy. (Len) Well, whatever it is, seven or eight days. When we're done with the water... and there's the tangerine juice, too. When we're done with everything, then we go up. Even though the radio said eight days. So maybe we only make it seven. But what the fuck do they know, you know? Air could be clear at six. CIear enough, anyway, for me to go up and get suppIies and come back down here. - What? - The Iast thing they said was... "200 miIIion dead in Europe." So that's not everybody. Nothing's going to be Ieft, Len. We don't know that until we see. Len, nothing's Ieft. The radio stopped. [sighs] There's no more pIanes or heIicopters. When's the Iast time you heard anything other than birds? We'II stay down here three more days. - And then... - (Mia sobs) - we'II drive to the marina. - No. [sighs] We'II get a boat. We'II go out on the Iake. - [sighs] - And we'II keep going untiI we find someone. - I don't-- - What? I don't want to... wade through a bunch of corpses to go steaI a boat to go Iook at more corpses Iying on a bunch of docks. [sobs] Even-- [sniffIes] even if we did make it, Len, what are we supposed to do? Do you reaIIy want to pIay "Adam and Eve"? BuiId it aII back up so it aII just gets destroyed again? Maybe peopIe wiII Iearn. It's Iike that guy who hit you for trying to take care of his kid. It's Iike that guy I defended-- great guy, good father, aIways showing me pictures of his grandson, who heIped invent the shit that kiIIed everyone. PeopIe aren't going to Iearn. It's something in us. It's something in the way that we're made. Then at Ieast... we'II have more time. At Ieast we'II go out on the water together. We'II find a boat with a nice, big cabin. Come on. [sighs] Len? That guy, Jay, from the Iaw firm? He feII in Iove with me. I never did anything. I never Iet him touch me. [sniffIes] But I... you know, I-- I made him think, I guess... that he had a shot at it. - Why? - It was just a way to-- Just a way to pass the time? To feeI better about myseIf, I guess. Why do you need to feeI better about yourseIf? It wasn't about you. [sobs] It was just my curse. Len. Either we're going to stay down here Iike caged animaIs, Or we're going to go upstairs tomorrow... and Iie down on the grass. Breathe in... and die... when and where we choose. We'II eat the chocoIate bar before we do it, okay? Okay? [pIaying softIy] [Anna giggling] - Oh, my God. - What? What? Did you buy this weird soap? What? I seriousIy think l've found my new religion. Oh, yeah, that stuff. Wait, have you read this? No. I mean, the writing's so tiny-- Wait a minute. Listen to this. "Einstein, 1 939. "After Nazis and Commies united, "proposes 'space bombs' "that destroys aII "unIess we finaIIy teach the moraI ABCs. "The reaI Rabbi HiIIeI taught Jesus to unite aII in, aII one, God faith." [sighs] (Iatch cIicks) (oxygen hissing) (hissing stops) Did you find a pay phone? (coughs) I got some noodIes. Just got to add water. And some drinks. And there's these things-- energy bars. And napkins. I couIdn't find a pay phone. I don't think they make them anymore. What is this doing on a soap bottIe? And where did you get this? I mean, it was at the heaIth food store. - It was cheap. - "We're aII one or none. "There is no god but God. "Teach 'Love thy enemy.' "One IsraeI-Moses- Buddha-Jesus-Mohammed. - One! AII one!" - AII one! "Dilute! Dilute! Okay!" (giggling) How about the switchboard? The hospitaI switchboard. Or aII of these houses and apartments around here. They've aII got to have phones. Esther... he's gone. - Erik's gone. - (Anna giggling) Oh, Iook at this. Read this. "For on God's spaceship, Earth"-- [together] "With bomb and gun, "we're aII one or none. "AII one, aII one, all one! Exceptions eternaIIy? AbsoIuteIy none!" "AbsoIuteIy none." (Iaughs) Oh, my God. Why is the most inspiring thing that I've ever read sitting on a soap bottIe? "DiIute." [together] "DiIute! DiIute!" "DiIute! Okay." [Iaughing] - You don't know that. - It's just the way it is. Because he couId be with any of his friends. That's just it, honey. You don't know it for sure. You don't-- [sobbing] No! No! - Oh, oop! - [Anna giggIing] No... [sobbing] Oh, God, no. Shh... [rustling] [rapid footsteps pattering] [siren] Okay, peopIe. We're cIosing down shop in two minutes. You've got two minutes to get your purchases up to the counter. Okay? - That's it, man. We got to go. - Come on. 250. Let's go. - Come on. - Yeah. Um... fuck. [man] Hey. We're done, man. Let's go. I-I gave aII my money to-- here, just run this. Yeah, okay, buddy. That's it. We're outta here. You're cIosing up shop. Just-- just-- you're not seIIing any more of these anyway, right? Don't be stupid, man. We ain't giving them away, either. I understand that. Just take this. Here. That's aII I got. It's aII I got. Get the fuck out of here. Get the fuck out now. - Hey. - Hey! Put down the kit! It's the end of the worId. Just Iet me waIk out of here with a chance. - Put down the kit. - [gun cIicks] What? The Iast thing you want to do on earth is shoot me? This is how this shit started, anyway. Right? That's how it started in the first-- [gunshot] - You ready? - I'm fine. Good. If you're fine, the tests are going to show it. Anyway... [groans] we haven't seen Dr. Henderson for a Iong time. - Come here. - That's right. And here I was, trying to cheer you up. Oh, yeah. (Sachs) You remember when we lived in Washington, the Georgetown apartment? Yes, l do. We both got the flu at the same time. Yeah. And l took care of you first. l ran out in the freezing cold, went and got you a nice, big bowl of hot soup. - lt was so cold. - Yeah. And I wrapped you up aII nice and cozy in a bIanket. Remember? Then I turned the thermostat up as high as it wouId go. Then it was my turn to baby you. Tucked you in real tight, And l made you some of those awful poached eggs you like. Mm-hmm. It's been a good Iife. Yeah, I think so. A good life. [no audibIe diaIog] Oh, I forgot to teII you. What? The best thing in the worId. [Anna, Erik moaning] I have something to teII you. What...? The best thing in the worId. We're going to have a baby. We don't have to do this. [sighs] Whatever we said Iast night, we don't have to do it. Not today, anyway. Mmm, mmm. I regret every fucking diet I ever went on. [chuckIes] Mmm. Come on. Let's get out of here. [gasps] If you have to, if that's what you have to do... go, but I won't. I-- I don't think we're going to run out of food. I don't think we're going to run out of water. I think that if we just stay down here another coupIe of days-- - No. - if we go up then, we're going to be fine. - Mm-mm. - Okay? - No. - Yeah. Yes! Yes. Mia! Don't Ieave me! Don't leave me. Stay with me. I Iove you, baby, I Iove you. I need you. I need you, I need you. I need you, I need you, stay! PIease stay! Please, l need you. Please? [rustling] [bird chirping] [girI] Mama, look what l found.
