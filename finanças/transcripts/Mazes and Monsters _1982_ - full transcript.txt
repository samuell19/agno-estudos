[sirens wailing] BUD: Look, I've got less than a minute. LT. JOHN MARTINI: You know I can't release the name yet. But they told me it was a student of the university. - Yes. - Right. Now what was he doing in there? How should I know? John, we're going in. OK. Be careful. Look, we heard a game of mazes and monsters got a little out of hand over at the university. Mazes and monsters? Right. You know how to play it? - My kids play it. I know the game. - Yeah. Well. - All right. up here. Five seconds. Let's go. Let's go. This is Bud Hayden live from Pequod Caverns, where I'll be reporting on the apparent disappearance of a grad university student, the victim of a seemingly innocent game, mazes and monsters. Now mazes and monsters is a fantasy role playing game in which the players create an imaginary character. These characters are then plunged into a fantasy world of invented terrors. The point of the game is to amass a fortune without being killed. It's kind of a psycho-drama, you might say, where these people deal with problems in their lives by acting them out. But in this case there might be loss of distinction between reality and fantasy, and possibly the loss of life in the process. I'll be back in three minutes with another live report. [music playing] Ah, nice to see you, Mr. Brockway. Nice hat. Thanks, Paul. Mom, I'm home. Thanks, Paul. Take care. Jay Jay, where are you? I'm in here. Oh, darling. You've grown. I'm not growing anymore. This is it. Well you have an IQ of 190, I don't suppose it matters if you are that tall. I'm late. Oh. Oh, where are you going? To the French consulate for cocktails, then to a new place in Soho for dinner, got rave reviews. Everything is less fattening. Even the Champagne has less sugar. Before I go I want to show you your new birthday present. But it's a month until my birthday. Oh, it doesn't matter. You'll see it anyway. Oh, no. JULIA: Oh, yes. Yes. JAY JAY: NO. JULIA: Come on. Voila. Oh, no. What have you done? It looks like a hospital. Don't scream at me. I worked my tail off to get this finished in time. Where's all my stuff? My furniture? I can tell you don't like it. Don't like it? I hate it. Jay Jay, do you know how many of my clients would give their eyeteeth for a Julia Brockway room like this? Your clients put their eyeteeth in a glass of water every night. You are still fresh kid. Mother, this is my sanctuary, my nest. When you change it like this, which you do every time I turn my back, you obliterate me, you wipe me out. It's just driving me crazy. And Merlin hate it, too. Don't you? MERLIN: Bird's can't talk. JAY JAY: Coward. Jay Jay, You know I would never do anything to hurt you. Well, I guess I'll get used to it. And when I do, you'll probably change it again. I truly do not understand why you are so upset. I thought it would be such a nice surprise. Must run. Actually, mother, college was fun. Oh, well I'll probably get straight A's again this term. Thanks, mother. I'm glad you're glad. Poor old Merlin. Poor Jay Jay. So Noreen is boring, huh? KATE: Boring is the nicest thing I can say about Chlorine. Kate, she is your father's wife now. No, you're my father's wife. Oh, baby. It's been over a long time. But I love you for saying it. Come on now. Mom? When dad left us, were you ever sorry you married him in the first place? For about one minute, but I was really angry. Listen, we had some very happy years together. Life is risk. Yeah, but-- I don't know. The guys at school are such chauvinists. I can't be myself with them. You know you have to pretend to be dumb because bright girls scare them. Feelings scare them. They don't really want to know me. They want a little act. I don't care. I'm never going to get married anyway. I'm going to be a famous writer. By the way, how is the writing coming? I got writer's block, but I finally figured out why. It's because I haven't really lived yet. So how can I write about things I don't know about? Well you could-- you would use your imagination. I tell you We're destroying our planet. They do a satire on television and a couple of years later it comes true. And no one's doing anything about it. Daniel will. Right, son? I don't know, dad. But you know where the future is? Well I'm not sure. Computers. Your father's right, Daniel. Have you thought any more about transferring to MIT? I know it's near here, and all of that. Mom, I think it's a really good idea that I be away from home. If I see you on the street I promise I won't say hello. It's not you. It's me. I'm just not that competitive. So Grant is comfortable for me. Daniel, I have seen students in my class and I have seen you. You have a special gift for computers. You've always had that. What I really love is to make up games for computers. There's nothing wrong with that. You can do it as a hobby. Daniel, your father and I are not telling you not to enjoy life, we're just telling you not to waste it. Who's going to make up the games in the world? Other people will. You have a much more important talent. Just give me a little more time, OK? Daniel, this is a very competitive world and you're going to have to live in it. Now. Not later, but now. Later you're not going to be able to find a job. Later they're going to want the computer expert from MIT, not a game player from that Grant University. Your father and I love you very much, Daniel, and you know that. Otherwise we wouldn't be so concerned. [music playing] KATE: Jay Jay? Kate? How are you? - Oh, I'm fine. - Good. Have you seen, Daniel? Oh, I took it for granted he was up locked in some room with his latest woman of the week. I don't know. Do we have a fourth player? Well, I typed up the notice. I'm going to put it up in the bulletin board, OK? Great. Let's go. OK. We've got to find a fourth player. Right. Someone who doesn't flunk out or freak out. Not like last year. [music playing] Robbie, you're starting new at Grant. That means no more games. You know what it did to your marks at Tufts. This time you're going to concentrate on your school work. Do you hear? Yeah, I know, dad. I will. I see another D, you don't see another check. Oh, Hall. Leave him alone. And you've had too much to drink. Again. Oh, threats and accusations. That's all you know. I should have driven Robbie up myself. Oh, you should? Well may I remind you, whether you like it or not we are still a family. I hate it when you drink. I drink to get through the day. I was a talented, well-educated woman. Oh, Cat. Please let's not start that again. It's getting very-- Well I could have been someone. All my life it's been what you wanted. Not ever what I wanted. Nobody ever asked me what I wanted. A nice way for Robbie to start a new school. Dad, this is it. You'd better make this right. [bells tolling] I'm going to miss you, Robbie. Now try hard and do well. Now you know how proud that will make him. I will, mom. And promise me you won't play that awful game anymore. Promise me. - OK. OK. I promise. OK. I'm-- I'm sorry if I sounded cold. Good luck. Call us collect if you need anything. I will. Thanks, dad. [music playing] Hi. I'm Jay Jay Brockway. Yeah. Hi. My name's Robbie, Robbie Wheeling. I'm sort of new here. Yeah, I noticed your pulling up earlier. Nice car. - Yeah. You know, I had a red convertible once for five minutes. The boy wonder gave it to me for my birthday, neglected to notice I was too young to have my driver's license. So I sold it and bought my minor burden a motorbike. What? What what? Uh, what is the boy wonder? Oh, that's what I call my father, he was the youngest publisher in New York. But I don't want to ruin your lunch by talking about him. Although, he's ruined many of mine. Listen, do you play mazes and monsters? That's-- that's my sign there. - Yeah. Yeah. Jay Jay Brockway. I used to, but I don't anymore. Oh, that's too bad. We really need a fourth player. Well, sorry. Uh, wait. Listen. I'm having an intimate little party tomorrow night for Brigitte Bardot. It's her birthday. So if you want to show up around eight, second floor. It will be the room with all the noise. - She really going to be there? - Who? Brigitte Bardot? No. Why would she come here? Although, maybe next year I should invite her. Yeah, well, thanks for the offer. I'll-- I'll be there. OK. [music and chatter] MERLIN: Brigitte Bardot, happy birthday. Robbie? Robbie, come on in. Hey, Jay Jay. Hi, I brought you something. Ah, 1987. Great year. Kate, a cork screw, please. Have fun. Thanks. [whistle] MERLIN: Brigitte Bardot. Here. Oh. What? Oh, nothing. I'm sorry. It's just-- you're very beautiful. Thank you. Uh, I'm Robbie Wheeling. Ah. Kate Finch. Hi. - Hi. - You're new here. Yeah, I am. I just transferred over from Tufts. Well, before they threw me out, actually. I didn't go to class very much and that's not the best thing for my marks. - Uh-huh. Why didn't you go to class? Well I was into some extracurricular activities. I played a game called mazes and monsters a little too much. You're kidding? What level? Uh, ninth. Ninth level. So am I. Oh. Isn't it wonderful to be finally creating your own scenarios? - Yeah. Yeah. And your own fantasies too. I'm really going to miss it. No, you're not. We have been looking desperately for a fourth player. This is wonderful. Just a-- Daniel? Daniel? I want to meet Daniel. Daniel? Meet Robbie. He's level nine. Hey, you going to play with us? Well, no. I-- really I can't. My folks-- Hey, we're not fanatics. How often do you play? Oh, a couple of times a week. No. I really have to crack the books this-- Jay Jay? Jay Jay? Jay Jay? Come here. Come here. Come here. - No, seriously-- - He's a level nine. - Level nine? He didn't tell me that. Well sign him up. No, I can't. This semester I have to-- - No, you can. Robbie, please just try one campaign with us? Yeah. - Really, you guys, thanks-- - No. No. And if you don't like it, if it's too much, you can always quit. Yeah. Well, if you're going to be there I guess I'll have to give it a shot. - All right. - Got some glasses? Yes. Yes. Here. I am the maze controller, the god of this universe I have created, the absolute authority. Only I know the perilous course what you are about to take. Your fate is in my hands. I am Glacia the Fighter. I have great strength and courage, strong armor, many weapons, and I have won the mighty talking sword of Lothia. I am Freelik, the Frenetic of Glossamir the cleverest of all sprites, not so strong, with enough tricks and powers to take me far and keep me safe. I am Pardieu, a holy man. In reaching the ninth level I have acquired many magic spells and charms, the greatest of which is the graven eye of Timor, but I also have a sword, which I only use should my magic fail me. There's a wasteland of gnarled hills covered with withered trees and dried grass. Beneath these hills is the entrance to the forbidden mazes of the Generac. It is rumored that within these mazes lives a mutated people, once human they are now unspeakably vicious. It is also known that there are wondrous treasures within these mazes for those brave and clever enough to find them. Thus warned, shall ye enter? ALL: Aye. Let the journey begin. [music playing] [bells ringing] [music playing] I have an older brother, his names Hall, Hall junior. And about three years ago on his birthday, it was Halloween night, my mother threw this big party for him. And in the middle of it when nobody was paying attention he ran away. We never got a letter, postcard, phone call. Nothing. Like he disappeared right off the face of the earth. And I've always wondered what it was that happened to him. It must be terrible. Actually not knowing is the worst part. Robbie, I'm so sorry. That night he came up into my room and woke me up and said that he needed all of my money so that he could go to New York. And I gave it to him, and he told me that he would keep in touch, but he never did. Sometimes I wonder if I hadn't given him the money he'd-- I don't know. It's funny, I dream about him a lot. ROBBIE: Hall! Please stop. Hall, come back. It's me. It's Robbie. Hall! Hall, please stop. Hall. Stop. Please. Come back. It's me. It's Robbie. Hall! What I really want to be is a movie or television star. I know that I was meant to do comedy. Unfortunately I'm not turning out to be the leading man type. Oh, it'll force you to be a good actor. Well, it'd help a lot if I looked like you. Not to mention what it would do for my social life. My social life is no big deal. No for you it isn't. No, really. Everybody kids me about being the great make-out champion or something. You know what that does to any girl who's sensitive or caring? She's decided I'm bad news before I've had a chance to prove I'm not. Yeah. So I spend my time with strangers, one after another. Poor Daniel. I wouldn't mind just having a girlfriend. That would ruin your reputation. Wouldn't that be nice? Listen, are we playing tonight? Uh, no. We can't tonight. We haven't played in three days. I've got a physics exam I really need to study for. How about tomorrow night? Uh, yeah. That's OK with me. Why don't you check with Kate and Robbie? [music playing] Kate? Oh, hi, Jay Jay. What's happening? Oh, uh-- uh, nothing. Come on in. No, that's OK. Kate will be right out. Listen, are we playing tomorrow? Oh. Gee, no. We're kind of busy. Uh, how about Wednesday? Sure. You sure you don't want to come in? No. It's OK. Well take it easy, all right? Was that Jay Jay? Mhm. He didn't want to wait. He seemed real down. Sometimes I can't figure him out. Ah, Poor guy. He acts so together, but he's really very lonely. Well can you imagine what it must be like to be 16 and a sophomore? Yeah. [music playing] We're all alone in the world. You know that, don't you? It's just you and me. MERLIN: Birds can't talk. Maybe I should smash my motorbike into the dorm wall. That's too ordinary. They'd think it was just an accident. You know that no grad university student has ever committed suicide? What could I do? It's gotta be the stuff that legends are made of. I want them to remember Jay Jay Brockway. [whistles] I know. The Caverns. The mysterious forbidden Pequod Caverns. Boy genius suicides in caverns. They'd talk about it forever. I'd be immortal. MERLIN: Poor Jay Jay. Don't worry, Merlin. Someone would feed you. [music playing] Close your eyes. - Oh, come on. - Close them. Close them. Close them. - OK. They're closed. - OK, now guess where we are. OK. Ready? Come on. Yes. Ready. - All right. All right. Keep them closed. - OK, they're closed. All right. Open them up. Oh, a double bed. Yeah. Now we can-- we can live together now. Robbie, it's-- you know it's too soon. OK? You should have talked to me about this. Well what difference does it make? We're together all the time anyway. Yeah and you know how I feel about you. It's just that I'm not ready yet. It's too soon. [music playing] All right. All right. Let's get out of here. Oh, Robbie. Come on. You know that our going together is the best thing in my whole life. But we've got lot of time, OK? So let's not rush it. [wind whistling] You blindly stumbled face to face with a dozen bloodthirsty undead. Woo! However-- however between you and the evil undead is a deep pit, where at the very bottom, you can see just a faint glimmer. It could be a legendary treasure of the Generac or it could be a trap. Freelik jumps into the pit to gather the treasure. How much does Freelik get? It's a trap. No. The pit is filled with sharp gem encrusted spikes. Freelik the Frenetic of Glosamir is impaled and dies. Pardieu save him. Use your power to raise the dead. Well I-- I can't. I don't have enough points to raise the dead. Oh, hell. Ah, Jay Jay, that was really stupid, jumping into the pit without using your sonar first. Really stupid. Why did you do that? Hey, cheer up, Jay Jay. You can start again as a new character. Oh, it'll take him forever to gather power. Well I didn't kill him. Did so. You weren't paying attention. Hey, let's not fight about it. Right. So what are we going to do now? I'd like to propose a new game, kind of an evolution of mazes and monsters, but we'd be playing at a much more sophisticated level. We're not finished with this game yet. Yes, but it's not the same without Freelik. Let's hear the idea. In all modesty, it's the most intriguing concept of the game I've ever heard of, something that no one else has tried. I propose we play mazes and monsters in a real setting, Pequod Caverns. I was there. I went in. Oh, it's fantastic. Jay Jay, those caves are too dangerous. No one is allowed inside them. We'll get expelled, not to mention getting killed. They're perfectly safe. I walked around all inside of them. It's a logical extension of the game. Naturally I'll be the maze controller. A couple of kids got lost in their once. They never found them. It's a new frontier. It won't be a fantasy. It really will be mazes and monsters. All in favor of starting a new game in Pequod Caverns say aye. Aye. Aye. All right. We'll get expelled. We'll have to keep it absolutely secret. Aye. I just need them. That's why. OK. Dinner for four on your credit card. That's what I said. Anywhere at Pequod. Mhm. Well about the only time I could sneak old Basil out of here is on Saturday morning. Early. - Perfect. We have a deal. Now just hold on a minute, Jay Jay. Me and Basil are pretty close. I got to know why you need him. You don't gotta know. You want to know. Same thing. You got to keep it secret. I don't want anyone invading my territory and ruining it. Yeah right. Like I got nothing better to do than run around campus telling everybody your dumb little secrets. I'm inventing the ultimate game of mazes and monsters, Pequod Caverns. You are nuts. I'll pick up Basil on Saturday. Early. Dress him warm, huh? [bells chiming] Jay Jay, Where did you get these costumes? From the theater arts department. I borrowed them. Hey, guys. Last chance to turn back. [laughing] JAY JAY: You sure? KATE: Yeah. You are entering the secret mazes of the evil Vorations. Somewhere within dwells the wicked Ak-Oga, the most fiendish monster of them all. His awesome wickedness is matched only by the greatness of his treasure. Shall ye enter? Aye. Aye. Aye. This is great. Come on. It's cold in here. Bats! [bat screams] KATE: Jay Jay? Jay Jay? Jay Jay? Jay Jay? Jay Jay? JAY JAY: Your maze controller is with you, unseen to your eyes. Now, let the journey began. But which way do we go? JAY JAY: Your decision. We'll let Glacia lead. She'll protect us. Thanks a lot. [screaming] Perhaps he was on a mission such as ours. DANIEL: Be careful. Could be a trick. Some skeletons possess mystical powers. JAY JAY: You have two questions. Is the skeleton evil? JAY JAY: No. Is it helpful? JAY JAY: Time will tell. Perhaps there's a clue hidden in the skull. Beware of the sacrilege. Glacia the fighter is not afraid. [screams] Look. Where the light was pointing. ROBBIE: Who among us can read this strange writing? I can. They are ancient writings of my people. I learned them as a child. They say, eat of the bitter herb. Will the herb give us wisdom or threaten us? Well first we must find the herb. Let us go to where the skeleton came from. Oh. Oh, I found the herbs. - No. No. Leave the rice there. So we don't get lost. Oh. Why don't we split up and each of us look for the herb? No. No. No. I don't think that's a good idea. What's the matter? Scared? No. It's just that-- are you going to be all right? Yeah. I'll be fine. Well I'm going this way. Um, OK. I'll-- I'll go this way. [music playing] A monster! A Gorvil. A Gorvil. [growling] Glacia! [inaudible] [yelling] Help me! Help me! [yelling] JAY JAY: Robbie? KATE: Robbie? Are you OK? - Are you OK, Robbie? - Robbie? Are you OK, Robbie? It's all right. It's all right now. I have slain the Gorvil. It's OK. Robbie. Robbie. Oh. Oh, Robbie. You were great. I just thought I was going to have a coronary occlusion or something. It was great. Jay Jay, That place is incredible. I was so scared. I love it. Great, Jay Jay. Really. I'm a holy man. I--I never kill unless I cannot overcome the monster with reason or spells. I've got these to compensate for my lack of war-like skills. DANIEL: Knock it off, Robbie. I loved it when Kate saw the skeleton and screamed. Oh. I was so scared. Oh, Jay Jay, I thought you mixed fantasy and reality perfectly. I was going to build some monsters out of paper mache and stuff? Oh, no. That would have ruined it. - Yeah? Yes. The most frightening monsters are the ones that exist in our minds. In Bless you all. DANIEL: Knock it off Pardieu. [thunderstorm crashing] THE GREAT HALL: Pardieu? Pardieu? ROBBIE: Who are you? I am the Great Hall. Once you glory in killing, now you are of a higher level. To attain the highest level you must be holy in all your life, you must be pious, humble, celibate. But I walk with Glacia, the Fighter. The holy man must walk alone. No. Wait. Please. Great Hall, I need you. THE GREAT HALL: When you are worthy, then you will come to the two towers and be one with The Great Hall. Wait. Hall! Please. Wait! [knock on door] Hi. Well, studying hard I see. Any way I could convince you to take a little break? Kate. Please. What's wrong? Kate, I-- I can't be with you anymore. I mean, I would really like to, but I just can't be with you any longer. Robbie, what-- uh, what do you mean? What did I do? ROBBIE: You didn't do anything. Are you mad at me? ROBBIE: No. No. No. No. No. Why would I be mad? Robbie, I don't-- I don't understand. What you-- Don't get upset. I love you and I will always love you, but I just can't touch you anymore. What's going on? Look, if you've, uh-- if you've met somebody else or you don't want to go out with me anymore, then that's fine. But just don't lie to me and-- and-- and say that you love me but you can't touch me. But I do love you. It is-- it's possible for me to love you without making love to you. I can't believe this is happening. This is exactly like last time. this is deja vu. It's-- it's-- what is it? Is it me, Robbie? You can tell me. You can tell me. Is it me? - No. No. No. No. It's got nothing to do with you. It's got nothing to do with you. Nothing. It's just me. [music playing] So you and Robbie are officially over? It's been over for a while now. I think I scared him off. Daniel, do you think I'm too tough? - He said that? - No. No. I was just wondering. I would say you're guarded, but you're not tough. Why is it every man I've ever cared for just says goodbye and walks out of my life? Like my father, and Stephen last year. Remember? Now Robbie. I don't know. I guess I-- I just don't know very much about men. No. You're-- you're the most perceptive woman I know. Thank you. Kate, uh, do you want him back? No. It was a shock at first, but we're good friends now. It's not romantic, but it's a lot more real. Have you noticed that Robbie's been acting a bit weird lately? What do you mean? You haven't noticed anything? What about his-- um, his blessing people all the time, and giving his stuff away, and acting so holey. He's just staying in character. Yes, I know. And that's exactly what I'm worried about. He's taking his fantasy character so much into real life that he has changed. Come on, Kate. Don't worry. I don't think Robbie is turning into Pardieu We work out our problems in the caverns and then we leave them there. What problems do you work out? Trying to be me and not a copy of my father. You know, you really are a lot different way from the game. So are you. THE GREAT HALL: Pardieu? Pardieu? Next you must find the secret city under the earth. ROBBIE: When? PARDIEU: When you have purified your mind as you have your body. But how will I know? THE GREAT HALL: Why? are you so impatient? Because I love you and I want you to forgive me. THE GREAT HALL: Remember all that you see. I'm making a map. THE GREAT HALL: When you are ready you will need no map. [music playing] [CRICKETS CHIRPING, FROGS CROAKING] Daniel? [music playing] KATE: Daniel? Daniel, answer me. Daniel? [bat screeching] [screaming] Daniel? Daniel? [music playing] Daniel? Daniel? Daniel, help me. I'm lost. Help. Daniel? Daniel? Daniel, help me. I'm lost. DANIEL: Kate, keep calling. I can barely hear you. I'm here, Daniel. I'm here. DANIEL: Keep calling, Kate. KATE: Daniel. Keep calling. Daniel, I'm here. Dan-- I'm here, Daniel. DANIEL: Kate? Daniel. Oh, God. I thought I was lost in here forever. You OK? Yep. I'm fine now. I want to tell you why I was in the Caverns. You were burying a body? I was cheating. I was trying to figure out where Jay Jay hid the treasure. You wanted to win that badly? Yes, I-- my father would be thrilled. But I know you wouldn't cheat at something really important. This is only a game. It's become a lot more for me. Will you tell Jay Jay? No, I didn't learn anything. Besides he'd be too flattered. [music playing] You know, I-- I was always like Mr. Spock from Star Trek. I thought I had no feelings like a Vulcan. I never thought I could fall in love. You're not like Mr. Spock at all. You're like the-- the tin man from the "Wizard of Oz" who thought he had no heart, and all along he had the biggest heart of all. You know, I was always afraid to get involved with you, because you were so attractive. [music playing] MERLIN: Happy Halloween. Happy Halloween. [music playing] Hey, welcome to the party. MERLIN: Happy Halloween. Happy Halloween. [music playing] Perry, this is supposed to be a costume party. Everyone else is dressed up. Why aren't you? That's pretty funny, Jay Jay. Who are you supposed to be anyway? Noel Coward. Noel Coward. [music playing] THE GREAT HALL: Now, Pardieu, You will know how to find me. Now you are ready. [music playing] Hey, Robbie? Robbie? Robbie? Hm. Hey, have you guys seen Robbie? Not since last night. Thanks. Robbie, can get pretty out of it, but even he wouldn't go away for the weekend and leave his door unlocked. KATE: Well then he's got to be around here someplace. JAY JAY: Hey, guys. He wasn't in his class this morning. I mean, I talked to everybody and no one's seen him. If he went away for the weekend then he would have come up to one of our rooms and told us the second he got back. Maybe he got sick or something and he went home early. Where would he go without clothes or his wallet? Where are you going? To phone his mom. [phone ringing] Hello? Hello. Is Robbie there, please. - No. Robbie's at school. Who's calling? This is Kate. A friend of his. Uh, he wasn't in class this morning and I just wondered if he'd gone home. Has he skipped class before? No. No. He's probably around here somewhere. Sorry to have bothered you. Thanks a lot. Bye-bye. Why'd you hang up like that? I don't know. I suddenly got scared. Hey, this isn't our maze. Do you think Robbie was involved with another game? No. No. If he'd been playing with another group we would have known. DANIEL: The Two Towers, that's Tolkien. What's the Great Hall? You know, maybe he was hitchhiking and got picked up by some maniac, you know, like that freeway killer in California. Jay Jay, Robbie wouldn't hitchhike. And where would he be going anyway? It just doesn't make any sense. He's flipped into the game. - Oh, come on. - No, I know it. I tried to tell you. He's been acting weird lately. Maybe he went to the caves to start his own game so he could be the maze controller. And got hurt or something. Oh, come on. Let's go. JAY JAY: If Robbie's in there it's my fault, all my fault. DANIEL: Calm down. It's not anybody's fault. KATE: Let's just hope that he's all right. Robbie? KATE: Robbie? Robbie? JAY JAY: This map just doesn't make any sense. Well maybe he invented his own maze. Holy men are supposed to see things that aren't there, remember? If we just consider this a second there's really nothing that says Robbie thinks he's Pardieu. Daniel, give me another plausible explanation. Right. So what do we do now? Tell somebody. And get expelled? No, I got an idea. But first we got to clear all our stuff out of here. I'll get the torches. Lost weekend does not make a lost person. Yes, but Robbie Wheeling isn't the kind of guy who would just run off without telling anybody. Even his parents don't know where he is. Maybe he met a young lady. Not Robbie. There is one possibility, Robbie was really fascinated with those caves off the Tulane. Oh, you mean Pequod Caverns. Yeah, I think that's what they're called. Maybe he got lost in there. LT. JOHN MARTINI: You were a good friend of Robbie's, right? Uh, yeah. He's-- Excuse me. You said, were? Oh, sorry. And what were you going to say? Oh, I was going to say that Robbie's a terrific guy. Everyone likes him. When you last saw him was he depressed or moody? Anything out of the ordinary? I don't think I've ever seen Robbie depressed. He's a very peaceful guy, into spiritual things. Like mazes and monsters? You mean the game? We know he played. We found a map in his room. You play? Oh, I used to, but, uh, it takes up a lot of time. I'm a straight A student. I know. What about the caverns? What about them? We heard some of the students were playing mazes and monsters in there. Yeah, I heard that, too. What kind of bird is that? It's a minor bird. Does it talk? MERLIN: Bird's can't talk. Funny. You teach him that? Yes. Does it bite? Oh, All birds bite. Who else was in the caverns? Uh-- Oh, I don't-- I don't know. I don't even know if Robbie was playing in them. But you said he was your good friend. Yeah, but he doesn't tell me everything. All I know is that he mentioned them once or twice. Why would Robbie go into the caverns alone? I really have no idea. Yes, Robbie was getting peculiar. It was, uh-- it was like the-- the game was becoming his whole life, and-- and sometimes he was more interested in it than me. So we broke up. Who'd he play with? Uh, I-- I don't know. He never really talked about that part of it. I don't think he really realized how dangerous the-- the game was. Robbie a doper? No. - Downers? - No. Drink? Well, you know, like anybody. A little wine or beer, but-- You and Kate Finch go together? Yes, sir. And you're still friendly with Robbie? Oh, sure. I didn't take her away from him. They were all over with when I came along. What do you guys think happened? One of the players Robbie played with got carried away and killed him. That's kind of far out. Mazes and monsters is a far out game, swords, poison, spells, battles, maiming, killing. Hey, it's all imagination. Is it? I'll be talking to you. But then why do I feel so guilty? It's like we're covering up a crime. But it wouldn't have helped Robbie to tell the cops we played the game with him. But would you look at what we have done? We've taken all the game stuff, everything from the caverns, and we have hidden it. But it had our fingerprints all over it. Yes, but Jay Jay that is withholding evidence. Robbie's in those caverns, and is dead because of mazes and monsters. Were involved. Were really involved. KATE: You're talking like something really awful has happened to Robbie. Well I think so, too. So what are we going to do? We could give my map of the cavern's to the cops. What map? I thought you said you hid everything. Well I was so proud of it. But this is going to implicate us. We could mail it. No, it'd take too long. I've got a better idea. [sirens wailing] BUD: Look, I got less than a minute. LT. JOHN MARTINI: You know I can't release the name yet. But they told me it was a student of the university. - Yes. - Right. Now what was he doing in there? How should I know? John, we're going in. OK. Be careful. Look, we heard a game of mazes and monsters got a little out of hand over at the university. 15 Seconds, Bud. Mazes and monsters? Right. You know how to play it? - My kids play it. I know the game. - Yeah, well. All right. Up here. Five seconds. Let's go. Let's go. This is Bud Hayden, live from Pequod Caverns. There's Martini's car. You guys wait here. Yeah? Hey, uh, Martini? Yeah, well stay on it. Hi. We haven't had much luck. We've looked in the caverns, someone even conveniently supplied us with a map of the game, but the caverns go on for miles. We have no idea where the body is. Actually, we're not sure Wheeling's in there at all. You want to know the truth? We don't have idea one where Robbie Wheeling is, and I don't know if we ever will. The only thing I know, is that if he's in those caverns, he's dead. [music playing] MERLIN: Happy Halloween. Happy Halloween. Happy Halloween. Merlin, be quiet. Jay Jay, you're wasting your time. You heard what Martini said. What if he is dead? What if he isn't? That's right. And as long as we don't know for sure, then he's alive. Jay Jay, that is an exact duplicate of Robbie's map. How do you do that? Some people get great tans. OK, now what do we do? Now we try to find Robbie. How? By using our game playing skills, accepting the premise that Robbie's become Pardieu, then this was created by Pardieu. Therefore, the solution is right here on this map. But if it's not a map of the caverns what is it a map of? MERLIN: Happy Halloween. Merlin, enough. Oh, my God. That's it. What? The Great Hall? It's not a place. It's a person. Robbie's brother's name was Hal, the one that ran away. Ran away? What are you talking about? Oh. Oh. Oh. Robbie told me that years ago his brother ran away on Halloween at his own birthday party and they've never seen him since. Now, the last time we saw Robbie was the day of your Halloween party. That's right. What else did he say? Oh, he said that he was dreaming about him a lot. Uh-- - What else, Kate? Uh-- Kate, there's got to be something else. What else did he say? [music playing] It's like looking for a needle in a haystack. We're not getting anywhere. OK, we'll let's go at this a different way. I still say because of Halloween and The Great Hall that it has to do with his brother. OK, I agree. But the big question still remains, is Robbie being Robbie? Or is he being Pardieu? Let's say he's being Pardieu. OK, where would a holy man go? On a quest. Exactly. To find The Great Hall? If The Great Hall is a person, could the two towers not be people? They could be his parents. Were going in circles. Let's call it a night. [music playing] Get him. Hey. What is that? Give me that. These are my spells. I guard them with my life. No! [music playing'] Oh, my God. Pick up. [phone ringing] Hello? I have a collect call from Robbie Wheeling. Will you accept the charges? Yes. Robbie? Kate, I'm in New York. New York? Robbie, are you all right? What happened? I don't know. I can't remember. Robbie, it's going to be all right. Where are you exactly? There's blood on my knife. KATE (ON PHONE): Knife? What happened? And it's on my hands. I think I killed somebody. I know I killed somebody. KATE (ON PHONE): Robbie, just tell me where you are. Uh-- uh-- uh, 40th and-- and-- eighth. OK, Robbie, now I want you to listen to me very carefully. It's going to be All right. OK? OK? OK. Now Jay Jay, Daniel, and I we're going to come and get you just as soon as we can. It's going to be all right. Good. KATE (ON PHONE): I want you to listen very carefully. I want you to meet us at Jay Jay's place. It's 605 East 70th street. 605 East 70th, Jay Jay's. KATE (ON PHONE): Good. Just go in there and wait for us. DANIEL: What are you doing with that stupid bird? JAY JAY: Aw, come on. Merlin's good luck. [music playing] Maze. [music playing] [hissing and banging] [yelling] [music playing] [shouting] Please, there's no reason to fear me. I am Pardieu. I am a holy man. I'm the king of France. Your majesty. I have been on a very long quest. Yeah, well, haven't we all. How long have you been in the mazes? I don't know. Years. I keep meaning to find another place, I just don't seem to. Can you tell me of the giant dragon? On my travels here I heard him. Dragon, you say? Yes, the giant dragon. The one above. [hissing and banging] There he is. Does he stand guard over the treasure? Stay away from up there. They catch you and they'll throw you out. They don't get down this far. I see. You are very wise. Perhaps you can help me. I am in search of The Great Hall. Beats me, pal. And the two towers? Yeah. Yeah. I know those. Oh, sir. I would be greatly in your debt if you could tell me the way. Good morning, Mr. Brockway. I haven't seen your friend. - But he said that he'd-- - I'm sorry. I've been here the whole time and no one's been here asking for you at all. Maybe he already went up. Sorry. What do we do now? I don't know. JAY JAY: Come on in. Oh, no. She's redecorating again. Hey, let's go to my room, guys. Well, I guess anything would be better than hospital modern. I love it. I love it. Don't you love it, Merlin? MERLIN: Bird's can't talk. Oh, my mother just redecorated my room. It's nice. It's different. [music playing] Well I propose that we start looking for Robbie in the last place he was seen, somewhere around 40th and eighth. I've marked every location where a holy man might go on the map. Good. Well now we're starting to think like him. How many places are there? Dozens. We've got to figure out which one. [music playing] The cloisters, that's medieval. No, we have to be in Pardieu's mind. He never heard of it. St. Patrick's Cathedral, that's something he would have seen. Along with 100 other churches. Remember, he's on a quest. He's not going to stop to pray. I just hope the cops don't have him. We would have heard. I'm out of ideas. We can't give up. He's one of us. But where do we look? I don't know. We've got to try. Two towers? Wait. Not the book. Real. Oh, where's my brain? The two towers are the twin towers, the World Trade Center. Pardieu is-- Going to join his brother. The Great Hall, who's probably dead. [music playing] [horn honking] [music playing] JAY JAY: Come on. Let's move. Let's try the observation deck. Excuse me. Excuse me. KATE: Sorry. JAY JAY: Excuse me, please. KATE: Can we scoot by? Thanks. OK, which way? JAY JAY: Over there. KATE: I don't see him anywhere. JAY JAY: Maybe he's back downstairs. DANIEL: Let's go back down to the lobby. JAY JAY: Excuse me. Where can he be? KATE: There he is. Robbie? Robbie? DANIEL: Robbie? JAY JAY: Robbie? Robbie? Which way? KATE: The elevators. Let's go, Daniel. ALL: Robbie? [music playing] JAY JAY: Where is he? KATE: He's got to be up here somewhere. [alarm blaring] DANIEL: The door. [music playing] JAY JAY: Hurry up. Robbie! KATE: Robbie! Robbie! DANIEL: Robbie! JAY JAY: Pardieu, what are you doing? Going to join The Great Hall. You can't. It's a trap. I have spells. I'm going to fly. You don't have enough points. I am the maze controller. Maze co-- Maze controller? Yes. And I have absolute authority in this game. Game? Game. Game. Jay Jay, what am I doing here? Kate, why can't I remember? [music playing] KATE: You don't know how good it feels to be finally writing my novel. JAY JAY: Yeah? What's it about? KATE: It's a surprise. DANIEL: Come on, Kate. Tell us. Well, it's about the four of us paying the game and how we conquered our fears through it, the terrible thing that happened to Robbie . It's hard to write about those feelings, but I'm not afraid anymore. Well I'm sure it'll be a bestseller. You know, I think we're all going to be famous one day. I'll tell you, Jay Jay, the theater arts department is in for a real shock with you in the director's program. I hope so. Well I'm the quiet type. I'm going to be perfectly happy as future captain of industry in computer software. I only wish Robbie was coming back to school with us. But his mother says he has to keep seeing that doctor. But the important thing is he's going to be OK. Maybe he'll be back next semester. We should be there pretty soon. [music playing] Hello! KATE: Hi. I'm so glad to see you. KATE: Oh, glad we could come. Listen, Robbie's friends don't come around much anymore. He'll be thrilled. - How's he doing? Oh, he's fine. He's around back getting some air. But before you go, I want you to know I don't blame any of you for what happened to Robbie. You didn't know it, but he was fragile at the time, and-- well, the game was an outlet for him, I guess. Anyway, I-- I just want you to know it had nothing to do with any of you. Thank you. Yeah, thanks. Oh, come on now. He's right around in back. Robbie! Robbie? Robbie, hi! Hi. Robbie? Oh. You look terrific. Yeah, you really do. Freelik? Aren't you dead? Didn't you die when you leaped into the pit? Hey. Come on, Robbie. Stop fooling around. It is you. Freelik, you have been restored to the living. Whoever did that is a great holy man. A greater holy man even than I. Oh, Robbie. Oh, Glacia. nimble, too. Perhaps you are preparing for yet another quest? Oh, Robbie. Glacia, has someone placed a spell of forgetfulness on you? I am Pardieu, the holy man. I had many strange encounters since last we met. a great dragon, a Gorvil. This is a good place to stay. Warm, very clean, and food is good and plentiful. Oh, Freelik, I have something. You may be interested. I have an eternally renewing coin. Every night I gave it to my innkeeper's wife to pay for my lodging, and every morning when I awake it is in my pouch again. Well, shall we not begin the quest? Robbie. This lake is enchanted. And beyond there you see the great forest. Now the innkeeper and his wife fear the forest and they warn me to stay away. I fear there must be some evil force dwelling within it. If we could vanquish that evil the innkeepers and his wife could live happily and in peace. Do you know of this forest? Yes. I am the maze controller. There is a-- a-- Kingdom of the evil voration's, ruled by the wicked Ak-Oga. Within this forest lies terrible danger, but also a wondrous treasure. Shall ye enter? Aye. Aye. Aye. Follow me. I know the way. I have seen the spirits dance in this lake in the evenings. They sing a song not unlike yours, Freelik, no unlike the sprites. I haven't been beyond this ridge, but the path's to the forest are clearly marked. KATE: And so, we played the game again for one last time. It didn't matter that there were no maps, or dice, or no monsters. Pardieu saw the monsters, we did not. We saw nothing but the death of hope and the loss of our friend. And so we played the game until the sun began to set and all the monster's were dead.
