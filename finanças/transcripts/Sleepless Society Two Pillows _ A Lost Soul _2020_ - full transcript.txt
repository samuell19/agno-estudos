ONE MORNING NEWS We have been informed of some shocking news for Thai politics. This afternoon, someone found the body of a rising politician named Chadchai Palakorn, the Deputy Party Leader of New Dawn Party, at a luxurious condo in the Sathorn area. The police conducted a primary investigation and found an injured person named Tew or Mr. Panithi and the murder suspect who has the pseudonym Ae. The witness of the incident was Kate or Mrs. Nasariya Palakorn, the wife of the deceased, who provided additional information to the officers that she had a work appointment with Tew at her place. Once Mr. Tew arrived, he saw her being harmed and about to be killed by the deceased, so he tried to stop him. In the end, Ae, a child with a mental disorder whom the deceased had previously asked to deliver drugs, saw Ms. Kate was being harmed, so he killed the deceased. Please stay tuned for further updates after the break. DECHA Hello, Decha. Are you working right now? I'm worried about something. Can you come and meet me? Why didn't you tell me earlier? This evidence could prove your patient guilty. I'm really sorry for this, Decha. I didn't think things would go this far. It's my fault for underestimating this case. Actually, I have been treating Kate for a very long time, but it must have been a long time ago since the professional line between us disappeared. It's all right, Tong. It's not too late to make everything right. I'll handle this case from now on. Can I have all these documents? The treatment videos as well. Sure, I'll go get them for you. I don't care if this damn evidence can tie anyone down. Right now, I'm sure the ones who killed Chad were Kate and Tew. I will make sure that I'll be the one to kill them. As for the doctor who provided you with the evidence, you go take care of her. - You mean... - Kill her. Get rid of the problem before she calls for help again. How are you? If this makes you feel uncomfortable, you don't have to come. Let's forget about the things between us for now. I came to see if you're all right. You're still not dead. Do you have anything to tell me? No. I told them everything. Is what the officers said... true? We are back with updates on the death of Mr. Chadchai Palakorn, the Deputy Party Leader of New Dawn Party. The police officers have sent Ae, who social media users are calling the White Murderer, to Dr. Pracha. By the way, I bought you some noodles. They're from your favorite shop. Do you want to have them now? I'll put them on a plate for you. They're good as usual. I already tasted them. Why didn't you tell me that you were always being beaten? I was scared you'd be disappointed. What did I do? It's all right Mom. It's over now. Excuse me, Kate. Could you give us an interview? From the primary findings of the police officers, is the point about Mr. Chad beating you up true? Why did you choose to keep this a secret? I'm sorry. I have no comment. The police said an autistic child murdered Mr. Chad. What actually happened that night? The autistic child is the murderer, right? These are the primary findings of the officers. I can't comment about this, but I would like to ask you all to be careful when you write news about this child, because he's a special needs child. It's a delicate matter. Regarding what you said about him being the murderer, I don't think anyone wanted this to happen. Also, for me personally, I didn't want this to happen, Excuse me. I feel so sorry for Kate. She's been through so much, but she still cares for people. WILL YOU RULE THE AUTISTIC CHILD GUILTY? NO EXEMPTION? #WHITEMURDERER. I GUESS IF HE'S REALLY AUTISTIC, THE FAKE ONE IS KATE. #WHITEMURDERER. There is an important question I would like to ask you. Are you sad about Mr. Chad's death? Yes, but I'm looking at his death rationally. If you are asking if I'm sad about his death, yes, I am. I'm always sad. Even though he beat you up? Yes. It's not that I didn't know it wasn't something right. But I had decided to exchange my sorrow for love. I always thought I could handle it, but as everyone knows, something happened to him, and it was something which couldn't be controlled. That's why I said I'm really looking at this rationally. If I think back to the reason why we got married in the first place and the problems we encountered, as well as other elements, then I know and understand why things have ended this way. This is the feeling of a woman, who has lost her husband. The police officers have concluded that Mr. Chadchai was killed by a person with the pseudonym Ae, who is an autistic child. White Murderer is trending on Twitter right now. This is interesting and worth following. Next week... Tew. What you have told me could put you in jail. I know. I don't know who else I can tell this to. You know what? I used to trust you. I trusted and respected what you wanted to change. However, you have let me down. To be honest, it's not too late to do what's right. Believe in yourself, just like how Professor Tom believed in you. At least 50 percent would be enough. The doctor has disappeared. I think she knows something. Why are you helping me? Why would my senior want to kill me? It's a long story, Doctor. I'll tell you briefly. Don't trust anyone. Did you bring your phone? Yes. Hey. We have to cut ourselves off from the internet for a while because we have to make sure no one is intercepting our conversation, or knows where we are. We will be the only ones who know about this. Are you joking? I always have this with me. Can you tell me about it now? Tell me whatever you know. By the way, how did you find me? It wasn't difficult to find you. You're not the only one who's been chased by them. I'm being chased as well. They still have no idea I'm alive. I have been investigating this case for a long time now through a person named Rat. I also know what they are trying to do. Please leave, Kate. I don't want to talk to you now. I said leave. Actually, I knew it. I knew nothing would ever be the same. That's right. It's all because of what you did. You've destroyed everything, so how can you expect it to be the same? Did you see the news? Do you know you have destroyed a child's future? I don't think you know. You never think about other people. Do you know what he'll encounter when he grows up? You've made me tell lies to everyone and provide false testimony to the police. Why are you still here then? Yes, I know, but didn't you choose to tell the police yourself? I chose it myself, huh? I chose to tell the police? I was stupid for telling them what you wanted me to say. You're so selfish for saying this. If I knew you would be this selfish, I wouldn't have wasted my time on you at all. None of this would have happened. Have you ever given anything to anyone? You've destroyed everything. You've destroyed me so much I don't know who I am now. How can you not know what you're doing? Why would you approach me if it wasn't for your brother? You were well aware of what that bastard did to me. Do you think it's easy to be me? Yes. I'm evil. I'm a liar, a bullshitter, and a deceiver. I've destroyed a child's future. I've let you down. But do you know why I did all of these things? I wanted to live a normal life. I wanted to be free from my damn husband. And do you know what? I'm free now, but... I'm not happy at all because I made the mistake of falling for you. Do you hear me? I love you. I love you too. But you know it's impossible, right? The more I love you, the more I lose my identity. The more I love you, the more I feel guilty towards Top. Kate. Let's end it here. I don't want you in my life anymore. If you still try to contact me, I'll tell everything to the police. I'll surrender myself. You should leave. Thank you. TAWICHAI SASISORN, PRESIDENT OF THE SENATE Sir. Are you leaving already? I'm sorry for your loss, Kate. Thank you so much. At first, I didn't think you would come. When your case was submitted to the court, I asked the judge to do his best to take care of your case until the day I ruled it. As for Chad, I was very close to him. Since we are all this close, I certainly have to come. Thank you very much. To be honest, I didn't think Chad was like that. Anyway, I'm here to send him off for the last time. Thank you. I have to go. Okay. Sir. Yes? Are you free tomorrow? I don't think it's possible. The case has been closed. The person named Top is being punished. Plus, your husband's party was lobbying to help free you back then. I don't understand why you want this case to be reconsidered again. Do you want to become a suspect again? That's not it, sir. I just want you to dig this case up again to find loopholes. Loopholes? What for? Can you tell me directly what you want? I want Top to be free. What? You're crazy. Do you know you're asking for too much? I know that. However, I'm also aware you're a politician who is a former judge, so I don't know who else has the power to do this other than you. I understand my husband helped me, but I also understand Top didn't do anything wrong. Do you know who is the culprit? I don't know. Please be honest with me. Are you interested in knowing who is the culprit? If you were really interested, then my husband's party wouldn't be able to interfere with you this much. If I say that I would pay you to do this, would you accept the offer? Kate, I think you should leave. I'll pretend we didn't talk about this and leave now. What if it's not money? If you think you can't dig this case up, then please leave this card as it is. However, if you think you can do it, I'll wait for you upstairs. - Top. - Yes? Come with me. Where are we going? There's an urgent order. Get up. There have been more updates on the case of the White Murderer, Yanin. Yes, this case has been linked to Kate's case, in which the court had already ruled that Top, or Mr. Pakorn Intarapalachai, was the one who murdered Bank, or Mr. Sanchai Pinitkha. This morning, the court received a request to reconsider the case, as police officers found an important piece of evidence, which was CCTV footage of Ae walking in the hallway of the condo. Ae is the autistic child whom everyone calls the White Murderer. Up until now, Yanin, the police haven't disclosed any further information. Audience, - Mr. Saranpat, we have - He might be freed. to keep track of this because it's possible... - Yes. - that Mr. Top, who is currently detained in jail, might become a suspect once again, together with Ae. Walk slowly. I'm all right. I'll close it. Actually, this is damn confusing. Why did they suddenly reconsider the case? Are you confused? Yes, but... I don't know. Think about it. Don't you think it's weird? At first, you and Professor Tom said they were on the same side, and suddenly the case is being dug up. Or is there another group? I don't have the time to think about it yet. I think if you want to know, you have to see who has filed the case. That's it. Actually, it might not be necessary since your brother is out, right? He only got bailed out. He's still a suspect. Do you have the bail money? No. Do you want to borrow from my mom first? You can borrow it. I'll find a way. How is everything, Kate? Did you see the news? Top will be bailed out tomorrow. Thank you for helping me. I worked so hard to help you. I know how much effort you've put into this. Okay. It's good you know. Actually, we should talk upstairs. It will be more convenient for us. We should talk here. I have something to do afterward. What about tomorrow? I'm not free then either. Do you know that I still have the power over the evidence and the direction of the investigation even after Top is bailed out? Yes, and I think you can give me the result as we agreed. Kate, I don't think you understand what I'm talking about right now. I understand. I understand it very well because I spent my entire married life that way. Negotiating, self benefits, and mutual benefits, Chad taught me about these by making me a victim. I know what men want and what women want. You play dirty. I'm protecting myself. It's an agreement. My objective is still the same. I want you to handle this case from the beginning until the end as we agreed. You'll have to excuse me. I have something to do. Thank you for your help. Top. Top. Why are you so thin? I'll be out soon. I saw the news about them reconsidering this case, but I still can't find the money to bail you out. You don't know about this at all? About what? Kate has already bailed me out. You really don't know a damn thing. Didn't I tell you not to get involved in this? Kate. Tew. You were the one who lobbied about Top, right? Yes, it was me. Why did you do that? Well, - I did everything because I-- - I told you to stay away. Why did you do that? What do you want me to do then? I just want to fix what's wrong. By doing this? By making an autistic child a scapegoat? Do you know how evil this is? Do you think I'll make up with you after you've done this? Do you think everything between us will go back to the way it was? Yes, I did everything because you're the only one I have. I only think about you. I did everything because I want you to come back to me. But what you're doing is no different than what Chad did. You're no different to him. You do everything without caring how it will affect other people. I didn't think you would be this evil. Right, Tew. Everything is gray in your eyes. You can change everything into white. But for me, everything is so dark and the only thing that can give me light is you. But I don't know what to do to make you come back to me. I don't know how else to show what you mean to me. What else do I have to do? If you still love me, can you come back to me? Can you come back to me? Come back! You don't understand. Why? I don't want to lose you. Tew. Can you come back to me? Can we go back to how we were? Tew. Don't leave me. Tew. Tew. I beg you, Tew. Please come back to me. Please don't leave me. I'm sorry. Chad, I'll avenge you. Subtitle translation by Tanida Itthiwat
