Your whole life's this truck Melons! Hey, leave me out of this don't drag me into it I can have four trucks here in half a day if I want to You can't match up to her This love here uses a truck every morning I thought you said you either wanted a baby or the truck So a baby is just like a truck to you You don't know what a baby is you're only after money And you're in the right place And as far as you're concerned you were born with a silver spoon in your mouth I don't have anything with you I told you to leave me alone I've signed a promise not to start any fights at the station Tell her to get out of here You two are driving me nuts with this three months and ten days You two can't have babies but I have eleven of them - Both of you, get lost - Leave her alone, her brother is here You must give him a promise too that's worse than the station He's a wolf with me and a sheep to others He can only force me that's because I have no one Ever since I became your wife I've had a bruise on my face Long time no see brother How are you? Go and put your scarf on I'm only keeping quiet out of respect for your brother Is it a sin to want to have a baby? That's what being a man is all about You keep nagging and things get this far You want to fight everyone I told you a hundred times you don't have the right You should know it well I told you I loved you at the start and I meant it But you made things turn out this way in fact the hell with a baby you called me every name in the book and I let them all slide by I keep overlooking things but you drag them on and on How are you brother? Are you gonna stay with me? I was going to stay the night with you but I've changed my mind You know what you slime? I'll go to stay with my brother Go and live with anyone you want to I didn't ask him to come here You want to have him? So do it, what's it to me? Besides you never know I'll marry him for sure after you Besides he's having considerations for you - That's enough... - Let her get lost leave her alone, she's not well go on Hold on a moment I went to the off set to see you but you weren't there Don't you want to get married yet? Once the white of the youth is gone then it comes the grey of the forty After the sunset of the fifty that's when the night arrives slowly Darkness! How can you get married at night? It's like baking bread You get it out of the oven too soon it's till dough and too late it's burnt - On time - You can lean on her I have a cane to do that It's not good for your heart I'll help you It's the third floor we'll go slowly The lift's not been working for two days It's neither food for living nor dying My late brother left this place for me It's just a room but it's enough for me The pigeons get the leftovers The guys talk about off set in the middle of so many cement, pipes and pigeons Why? You are a writer - Needs fresh life - You're alone, why don't you write? - I'm not alone - So much issue you can use Mr. Smile, Banan, pigeons and so much talk Political memories! Write it, you've always wanted to write a couple of novels Nousin, Naderi Cafe, Marmar remember? You used to talk about it a lot So much time - What did you with your heart? - I went to a doctor He said I needed an operation to put batteries I priced it it was 300 thousand tomans Seyed Ali's brother said he knew of a second hand in cheragh Bargh Cheap It belonged to someone who died and the inheritant wants to sell it Second hand American is better than a new Korean And now it's here And it's not working like a clock it is a clock And a quartz one too My eyes have been hurting recently and when they do I can't see anywhere My temples feel like popping until I pour medication in them I told the doctor to tell me if I'm about to go blind so I can get ready for it Is that why you're not working anymore? Any news of your brother? Someone brought his tag One of his comrades Do you want me to put Khansari on for you? Marzieh is in it too And Banan as well But Banan... Banan is good Toobi, the queen of all ladies how is your mother? The black shirt is because of her It hasn't been seven days past yet [reciting the Quran] Who is that? - Hello Ahmad - My condolences I figured the seventh day would be today And it wasn't too hard to find it - Here you are - Thanks a lot This is Zivar, my sister Ahmad is my new friend I really appreciate you coming Jalal, this Ahmad here is a great fellow - Hello - Hello Sister! You should have come back to your mother's house But I was following up on the divorce it's about to be wrapped up You know it Naghi is working on Land Rovers now He told me I had to sell melons on freeways in front of him... Until the end of three months and ten days But I told him profit in selling melons is in uptown He stinks of opium when he comes home at night It's gotten hard to go and buy melons in the morning anymore brother I can't yell through the speaker too I wish you had stayed the other day at least he would have knows I had somebody Let him go and buy them You have me Pardon me, but one of the boys whom Reza knows too, he's young but he is a man... He's above the rest of them I'll have him go to get the melons every morning with or without you Thanks a lot That's Mohamad, my brother's friend - Hello Reza, hello sir - Hello My condolences My name is Ali I was the one who brought Mohammad's tag to his mother God bless her I won't ask it again who's got Reza's gold and money? I can't believe you think of me that way Do you really think that I...? Why you? You're a true man I'll be back in two days and I don't care about any of that - Whoever it was, hit the wrong spot - Leave him alone You'll find him, and you'll put the money and the gold and specially that tag on the table It's not him Come here Ahmad Ahmad... Let's go together to check up on the guys What does he do for them? That's all in Abdul's hand There are times when you have to stand up and times when you have to bail But so help you God if the two get reversed Then you'll be indebted to yourself for the rest of your life I'm trying to ruin Abdul's organization somehow - Careful not to get cheated Ahmad - What for? Why do you say that? Things are changing A few of the veterans went to see Abdul No one's been able to find out what it was all about They've kept it under a low profile I checked on a couple of guys and told them to be on their toes I told them to bring the news on time so we'd know what to do I mean we're not here to give free rides Besides we have to take the fall and they take the profit You didn't tell me what was wrong with the guys today? What are you here for then? - Ahmad... - You're just watching? Listen to me for God's sake You only focus on your kids Fine, but Abdul intends to enter other avenues I can smell it he's jumping higher Spare parts Flour is good but fruits and flours and shit like that... He wants to put an end to them - How are you? - Fire feels great here at night The cigarette market isn't so bad nowadays By the way how much is butter coupons? Get back on your side What are you telling him? Move it And don't you look at me like that or I'll smack your head off Let's go Ahmad It's your fault, for not listening to what your older tells you - What were you telling him anyway? - Leave him alone Just sit down and mind your own business You do well what do you care about coupons? He'll sit directly on grease as he always does Iranian or Afghani worker, it doesn't matter they will not go to the kids Sure The other side there are rotten fruits and so many animals, mosquitos will gather for sure And there are lots of insect killers You only need to open the box like so And spray it like I'm doing Give one to the Afghanis too Get over here - What are you doing here? - Hi uncle - Hi - Hi uncle Come over here Why are you all following us? Get scattered And sell your cigarettes And careful with the cars Let's go Reza It turned out really good this time Here comes Ahmad too Come here Hello Ahmad - You're here to, I need to see you later - Sure thing Careful not to fall down - Hello uncle - Hi dear - Hi - How are you son? - Hello Uncle Ahmad - Hello I just got back from Turkey last night Do you need Studying clothes?
