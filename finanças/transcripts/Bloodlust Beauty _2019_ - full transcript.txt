Your time is over. Even though, your husband was crying for my help. So you would be spared. But we can't prevent the inevitable. It's your fate, they said. Help! Help! Such a pity. You can be a good asset. Dumbhead! You almost kicked me! Such an overact jackass. Forgive me, boss. This girl is such a burden Yes. But you almost kicked my face I will kill you! What will we do to this woman? She's all broken. What else can we do? Throw her to the river! Ok boss Be careful! Don't you blame me. Throw her! She's still fighting! Chill, Maryam! Die! Throw her off! Maryam! I just remembered the three tall guys. The other three are just average. But there was a car following her behind. The vehicle was jeep type. You're the last one who has been with the victim. We haven't found the body until now. Her body must have been drifted away by the currents. Have you checked the estuary? At Ancol? We will keep investigating it. Forgive me Maryam. Please forgive me Ucup! This is just Jupri! Why are you looking here and there? What are you looking for? I saw a ghost. You got to be kidding. You might have seen a person. I swear! Can you smell it? It's the smell of death. That's your stinky breath! When the air smells like this, the ghost is near. Are you calling me a ghost? I should better be going. Hey, Cup. What else do you want? Hold on! We go together, okay? Okay, let's go. Cleo Maryam? Honey... Honey...? I swear. A few nights ago I saw "Si Manis" (The Sweet Girl) Who's "Si Manis"? Do I have to say her name? Maryam. I saw at the edge of the bridge. What bridge? Ancol bridge My goodness. that's just superstitious. I believe him. Because, I saw her with my own eyes. Going home from weekly meeting, there was a girl at the edge of the bridge. Wearing red dress. When I look closer, her feet didn't touch the ground. Maryam was floating on the bridge. My goodness. Ghost! My bicycle installment is not yet paid off. I was almost reciting The Throne Verse of The Quran. Did you recite the verse? No Why not? I haven't memorized it. When will you pay? It's been almost two weeks. I need to wait for her death certificate Then, I can get the house certificate. Even, the corpse has not been.. I ask you "when". Give me a fix date. Next week, okay? It won't go longer than next month. If you break your promise, I will confiscate your car. Got it? Okay, Sir. Yes. I am going home. Good evening, Lady. Are you going alone? Indeed, Sir. Where do you want to go? Can I drive you there? I want to go home. No need. I won't bother you. Don't say that lady. Fate has brought us together. For a sexy lady like yourself, I'm willing to be bothered. Hop on lady. Pull over, Sir. Are you sure? Indeed, Sir. I don't recall to see any house at this place. Yes, there is. Where? There... Where is it? Don't you remember me? Where's this guy? He always comes late to meet me. Please spare me. Allah is the Greatest! Ghost is just a myth. I've never met a ghost in my whole life. But there are lots of witnesses who already saw her. The proof is clear. Two of our friends died, Brother. You still don't believe it? How can we fight her? We need to take care of the corpse. Burn it to the ground. So, the ghost won't have any trace on Earth. But we need to cast a spell on it. Spell? What is the spell? I have no idea about that. You read too much ghost stories. Why don't we fulfill her wishes, so the ghost will be at peace. Come here! Here's the thing, If you got killed and you become a vengeful spiritâ€¦ ...what do you wish for? Revenge! Who did she want to have revenge with? Of course to us. Us? Just you, not us. It's me. Impossible, Cup. What else, Brother? This is surely a vengeful spirit. Maryam won't haunt people. Because Mrs. Maryam was pretty? Lots of vengeful spirits are pretty. My goodness, Cup. Thank you, sir. Be a little sympathetic. Imagine if you have a girlfriendâ€¦ ...and you love her Would you accept when people said your girlfriend is a ghost? Maryam won't even hurt a fly. Even if she's haunting people,... ...it's impossible for her to kill people randomly. This isn't random at all. Revenge? I didn't even know who killed her. Vengeful spirits know that kind of thing. Even I know the victims. Who? They are Mr. Oji's henchmen. The famous loan shark around here. Mr. Oji? Don't scream like that. You're the one who scream. He did nothing. Are you sure? Definitely. His henchmen patroled at the market, When I was vendoring there. I know every each of them. Pardon me, Sir. Do you want your food to be heated? It's not necessary. Just clean it up. Ok sir. Bi... What happened? How did you fall? Sir.. Who's that? So annoying. Sir.. Don't kid with me! Uncle Marwan! Uncle! Uncle Marwan! Uncle Marwan! Jak Jaka Hi there.. Please don't, Maryam. Please don't, Maryam. Sir! I was just following orders. But it was a good order, right? Please don't, Maryam. Please don't, Maryam. Marwan Jaka Where are they? Gito Yes Brother. GIto... Gito... Yes Brother Where're you going, Gito? I can't handle this, Boss. So, you will leave me alone with the ghost? I can handle any human, but this is above my ability. How dare you! I am not going to forget this. Take care, I wish you luck boss. Who are you? It's me, Mr. Oji. You, prick! Why do you come here? Do you want to die? Someone ordered me to kidnap you and Maryam. Who was that? Who's the guy? Release me! Let me in! Who's the guy? Roy ordered me to kidnap and kill you both. Jerk! I still have the contract between me and Roy, if you need proof. But, on one condition Keep me safe until I make it out of town. Keep you safe? Maryam spirit won't attack you, I'll be safe with you. You had ordered your henchmen to rape and kill her, remember? Just go to hell! Roy will get away without me. No evidence and no witness. How's it gonna be? We have a deal? No. Where are you going? I'll force him to confess. What about me? Just stay there. Roy Open Open You prick! You accused me, while you're actually the mastermind. It's all because you had an affair with my wife. You insolent prick! You're such a jerk! Turn yourself in to the police, or she won't get her peace. Don't act like you know what she needs. I risked my life for this family. Don't forget, You're the one who destroyed our household. Fine If you won't do that, I will. Go ahead. So you can go to jail... ...for breaking and entering while threatening me. Oji is in my house. You can't get away with this. Mr. Yudha. I am grieving too. Both of us are grieving. We can't change the past. Perhaps, the only thing we can do in this hard timeâ€¦ ...is to forget everything that happened. What did you say? You asked me to forget? Do you know what happen to me? I was kidnapped Got beaten, getting stabbed and almost die. Your wife got raped until she diedâ€¦ ...all of those things happened because of you! Now, you ask me to forget all of it? I can't do that. A person like you, have to die, or rot in jail. What are you doing? What do you want? Don't be stupid. What do u want? Are you nuts? It's a full circle now. After you killed my wife... ...you break into my house, and trying to kill me. Because I was the only key witness in your homicidal act. You prick! You're such a jerk! Help! Help! Calm down. Calm down. Help! Help! Help! Help! Shut your mouth! Help! Help! My goodness! What is happening? Let him go! Come with me! Let's go. Calm down. Take it easy. I'll get water. Hang on! Listen to me! Let me go! He's the killer of Maryam. This is a country of law. Don't accuse someone carelesslyâ€¦ ...if you don't have any proof. I have a witness. and he has the proof. Who's the witness? Oji. He came to my place. He said that Roy ordered him to kidnap me and kill Maryam. Oji, the loan shark? Indeed, Sir. Just come to my place, If you don't believe me. Let's go. Why is it open? Oji Oji What is it, Mr. Yudha? My goodness. This house is really cursed. Mr Yudha, did you kill Mr. Oji? It wasn't me. Why did I take all of you here, if I was the killer? He was still alive when I went to Roy's house. I locked the door myself. That's Mr. Oji. Indeed. Pardon, you can't go anywhere for now. You don't believe me? It will be proven, if you're innocent. The real killer could run away, if we don't look for the killer. This must be the work of Maryam's ghost. What the hell, Cup? Why did you scare me? You're the one who scare me. Why am I to blame? Indeed, it's your fault. I was just applying a face mask, what's wrong with it? What's happening, why are there so many people here? Look it by yourself. What happened? Oh God she faints again! Yudha. Where's he? Is it better for me to go out of town? I think it's safer. You can't go, sir. You're the key witness. Better for you to be here. You're safer with us. We will protect you. Ain't that right? Indeed. Can I be safe from the ghost's attack? As long as we can hit the ghost with the rod. What's with the signal? What's wrong with this? There you go. Oh my bitter luck Sir... I want some coffee, Sir. Bitter, bitter, bitter. Don't make it bitter, please! Make it sweet Right, right. Sweetest coffee for you, sweetie. It's a special coffee, so sweet, I'll rain you with sugar. Do you think I'm Sweet? Yes. Everyone knows, you're the Sweetest in the world. Is it only in the world... ...what about the afterlife? Why did you ask me that? I've never gone there. Do you want to go there? No, thanks. I have no plan to go there. I can't open a coffee shop in the afterlife. Now, she's laughing. Here's your hot coffee. Thank you, Sir. Welcome I want to apologise to the villagers for all the mistakes I've done. We forgive you even before you apologised. You don't need to come, a piece of letter will do. Where's your wife? My wife is going to bed early. She likes to sleep early. She's snoring and her pillow is full of saliva. That's my wife after all. What can I do about it? Sweetie She's gone. My goodness, she finished her coffee. Such a coffee-lover ghost. Sir... Why are you still here? I haven't paid you yet. Free of charge for you, sweetie. I still have three sacks of coffee in the shed, carry them yourself. Please accept this. No need, sweetie. Accept this!l I will accept this. It's cold, sweetie. What is this? Sweetie? She's gone again. What is this? It's a finger! Honey... What's wrong? In my bedroom ceiling.... ...ghost is there. A Ghost? Yes Let's check it out. Do you know who I am? I'm the one who loaned money to Oji. It's not been returned until this moment. Let alone the profit, the capital hasn't been returned. Now, Oji is dead. But not my money... ...right? Is my money dead like Oji? No, Sir. So, Oji's debts have automatically become your responsibility. It becomes your direct responsibility towards me. Do you understand? I understand. You know this picture, right? Your mother Franky, Sarah, your siblings. Do you love them? I love them. But, they have nothing to do with this. Of course they do! They have blood relations with you, right? And now, we are in a relationship, remember? Any monkey business, and I will kill them all. Got it? About Oji's killer... ...it can't be a demon, right? It's a ghost. A ghost or not, that thing has to die. What do you mean? Igor Find the most skillful shaman... ...take care of this shenanigan! Ok? So, Mr. Roy could get his focus back to earn lots of money. To return our money. And all of the interests. Will do, sir. The key is not to be afraid! You have me, "Si Mbah" (Old man). Nothing can defeat me, "Si Mbah". Do you understand? Understand? I understand. Understand. MANTRA SPELL... Maryam, I'm here for you. How powerful this ghost is. Rage and fury have made her so powerful. My spells have no effects on her. What's next, then? It's inevitable. Run... Maryam. Forgive me. Maryam. Please forgive me! Maryam. Forgive me. Maryam... Enough, Maryam! You don't have to do this. I know that you're still alive. I've found where you live now. You survived when you were thrown to this river. You planned to have a revenge. I also know the reason you tore this picture. Your father was a special force commander. How you survive... ...how you defend yourself. Your father taught you those things. That's not just a random skill. Give a taste of fear to your enemy! And you've already won half of the battle. You gave them those fear by becoming a ghost. As a woman, you need to be strong. The world is cruel towards women. A woman can only be respected if she becomes a ghost. I respect you, Maryam. I admire you. I love you, Maryam. Maryam. The one you admire and loveâ€¦ ...is already dead with her love to her soulmate. Maryam. Please forgive me. I know... I know, I treated you wrong. You deserved a better husband than me. But, everything happened because of him. I was blind when I knew that you had an affair with him. I can't control my rage. She never had an affair. She always looked after her honor. She always respected you. And also your marriage. Nothing ever happened between us. Is that true? You ordered that lowlife to kidnap and kill us? Is that true? I realized that I have done a fatal mistake. I tried to cancel that planâ€¦ ...but I was too late. I thought that I've lost you forever. Seeing you here, I realized one thing. From the first time we met, since we got marriedâ€¦ ...until now, I've never stopped loving you. I love you, Maryam. But I deserved to die. It's okay, Dear. Kill me. Kill. I can only apologise. I'm sorry for unable to give you happiness. I'm sorry that I'm such a horrible husband. Forgive me. Maryam Maryam Honey I've never stopped loving you too. You are the Love of my life. I want the old you. We try again from the start. I love you, honey. Mr. yudha Mr. Yudha Mr. Yudha Forgive me, Maryam. I love you, But I have to do this for the sake of my mother. For my family. You need to die, so they can be alive. Forgive me. Maryam You prick! Jerk! Don't die, Maryam! Don't die, Maryam! Love. Don't move! Everyone wants to be happy. But only some of them who can really feel it. Others are just waiting for the happiness to come. We won't know for how long. Some people say that to be truly happy, we have to cross the line. And the line that separate us from Eternal Happiness... Sugeng. ... is Death! Rickshaw, Lady? Yes, please. To Pademangan, Sir! As you wish. Hey Lady, why are you wandering alone at night? Aren't you afraid? Such a Sweet Lady like you, why so arrogant? Sir. Can you not be such a flirtyâ€¦ Ghost!
