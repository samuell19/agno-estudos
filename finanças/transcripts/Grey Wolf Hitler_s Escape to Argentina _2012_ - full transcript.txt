There, at the bottom of those stairs... they found a partially burned human body... with a lot of black hair on the right side of his face... and a little black mustache. They looked at him in more detail. And then their doctor came to the conclusion that it was,... as they called him,... a bad double of Hitler, not Hitler himself. If so, then it is unsaturated without a trace. Many, many, many years... The Germans have always had a great influence in all spheres of life. In schools, in construction, in industry, in trade and politics. Many high-class Argentines, very, very rich,... they protected those people too. For economic reasons. These people came with a lot, a lot, a lot of money. Hitler probably came after 6-7 months as I worked. The first time, I remember, Mandaver told me,... 'A very, very, very important man will come today.' That person when she came looked... You felt the power in him. Black hair with few gray strands. Dry face, no mustache. He was given so much respect. Who was that man here? He had to be an important man because you tell me,... the people who came, Martin Borman was there,... and Martin Borman was the most important. I was surprised. While Martin Borman was there everyone else respected him. Everyone stood up and shook his hand. That is how the respect that people had for him was seen. Then Mandaver said to me, 'Do you know who this is?' I said I didn't know. He told me, 'Führer.' He looked completely different than the first time,... it looked much fresher. Then I saw a person with dark circles and... he looked very tired. He looked like me now. He walked hard. I felt depressed. This is the first time I have ever talked about these things. They are scared. People are afraid to talk about this... because there are still Nazis in Argentina. The Nazis did not disappear in Argentina. There is one thing about the Nazis in Argentina. Who was there, grew up there and is still there,... will remain for many years to come. Many people have a Nazi mentality. History tells us that they are the most hated man of the 20th century... Adolf Hitler and his wife Eva committed suicide... in the hell of the Führer's besieged bunker in Berlin in 1945. But all over Argentina, in the FBI files... and according to the statements of the following eyewitnesses,... a different story emerges. Bariloche, Argentina February 1962 It wasn’t the way we thought it would end. People forgot about him. World or... most of him believed he was already dead. Time just bypassed him. The world is a very different place now. The secret has been kept for so long. Now it will have to be kept even longer. At least his family came for the last farewell. No one could blame them for being left out. Luna Park, Buenos Aires May 1936 {\pos(192,235)}We have been preparing Operation Fire Earth since 1943. Among them, General Miller and Reichsleiter Bormann did a good job. Argentine dictator Juan Domingo Perón knew, of course. Senior Admiral Denic told his men,... 'We built for the Führer in the far south of Shangri-La'. And all over Argentina we are. Many of our submarines have docked since then... bringing valuables and people. The greatest treasure ever plundered is now at our disposal. I came in 1943 with General Faupel. And I stayed to prepare the way if the unthinkable happens. And now it has happened. General Fegelein arrived only a week earlier,... but soon took command. Of all the ‘mountain people’ he was the most reliable. And as Eve's brother-in-law, he is closest to the family they had in 'Fiery Land'. Patagonia was practically a German colony. And of course, they are dead. Who would look for them? General Miller used this trick many times,... faking his, Bormann's and Führer's deaths. San Ramon estate July 1945 {\pos(192,235)}In July 1945, I was a housewife on the San Ramon estate. The whole house was in business for days. The guests have already arrived from Cordoba and Buenos Aires,... and we're told we're expecting more. The property was German property. I worked there for about ten years after my husband's death. We had the only radio in the area capable of catching news from Europe. Bariloche, the nearest town to us is about 25 km away. The trip was awful, but we were pretty independent on the property. I was not surprised to hear that the Hitlers were coming. No one here believed the stories of killing himself anyway. The San Ramon estate belonged to the Prince of Hamburg-Lipe,... a member of Prince Bernhard's family from the Netherlands,... who was an SS officer himself. Bernhard was often in Bariloche after the war. {\pos(192,235)}The last 12 months have taken the soul out of his body,... if not from his spirit. Without the penicillin we got from Dallas... that damn Staufenberg bomb would kill him. No one knew how many pus scraps he got from the table. Or how close he was to death. But here, enjoying your favorite food safe with family and friends,... his health was improving. Everyone in the family learned Spanish. The Führer personally learned this strange new language with his daughter. There are even signs that his sense of humor is returning. But as usual,... there was a time to relax and a time to plan. He may be in exile,... but with Bormann controlling the greatest wealth there is... and with Miller managing operations,... now was the time for the plans for the Reich to continue to exist. Even after only a few days in Argentina, they looked happy. We made a good choice. The whole area looked like their home in Bavaria,... and now they were safe. Hidden in the mountains of Patagonia... and again among trusted friends. They stayed with us, I mean almost a year,... and then sometime before the end of 1946... or early 1947... we were told that Hitler had a car accident... near the estate and that he died. We never saw the family again. Now they have died for the second time. Even here the trace has faded. It was time for a revival. Mar Chikita, Argentina November 1946 {\pos(192,235)}Hitler and his wife were here at least three times after the war. The first time was in 1946, when they stayed for about three months. Every day they would walk along the shores of Mar Chikita Lake. His bodyguard said he knew to say,... 'The sunsets here are beautiful'. The Ejhorn family owned a large estate right on the coast. They were great Nazis. Before the war, they visited Hitler in Berlin. The hospital they called 'Hotel Vienna'... was built in 1943 at a cost of some $ 25 million. It was a 5 star hotel if nothing else. The hotel was miles from nothing, but again there were plenty of guests. Many of them came for medical treatment. Most of the staff were Germans from Buenos Aires. Although there were a couple of people from the bar who worked at the hotel. Of the 70 workers, 30 were in security. Everyone knows that Hitler and Eva stayed here after the war. They had their own bedding,... dishes and cutlery with the letters AH printed on them. When they were here in 1946, the hotel was closed to the public. It is never open as a hotel again. Inalco, near Bariloche January 1947 Complex in Inalk,... 20 estates on the 8 km long shore of the lake were completed in 1943. {\pos(192,235)}The same year as many of our other estates across Argentina. {\pos(192,235)}Available only by seaplane or boat,... it was guarded by the Saracen Tower... which controlled Lake Nahuel Hapi. I was born in Hanover in 1912... and I served as an engineer on the smaller battleship 'Count Spe'. After we were interned, I escaped... and I lived under the name Pablo Glocknik. {\pos(192,235)}I was where two of our submarines were... {\pos(192,235)}arrived on shore in July 1945. {\pos(192,235)}I was transferred to Inalko, but I didn't know why. This is where the Führer will recover with his family... and will plan the rise of a new Reich. Then I saw him. Hitler did not have the same face. It was a bit 'modified',... but it was Hitler. To me, Hitler was God. Sometimes I woke up and I wondered... is it really true that I'm with the Führer. Amazing thing. For a girl poser, Eva,... I think it started as one long vacation. Far from ruined Germany with her new husband for the first time. Finally, they could play a happy family with their daughter Ushi. She hasn't looked so happy since the late thirties. No more hiding like Miss Brown. Finally it was Eva Hitler. Inalco, near Bariloche, April 1948 {\pos(192,235)}Martin Bormann arrived at the Center for the first time during April 1948. {\pos(192,235)}He also changed his appearance. The other guests have already arrived. Two of them are senior generals,... and other Argentine supporters and financiers. Borman's mission was serious. With more than 900 screen companies in neutral countries... The 'Brown Eminence' managed to get away with the greatest crime in history. Borman worked tirelessly. The center in Patagonia was the heart of the international network. On April 26, Hitler and Bormann met privately... which lasted almost three hours. Planning took 17 days. Nobody wanted to leave anything to chance. Bormann was supposed to be a key man... and all orders and plans prepared at the Center... will come from him. Huge sums of money will continue to compromise important figures... in government, finance and the press. Bormann did not intend to stay with the Führer. He said he had no place with the Führer. Not until the party can rise again. His place was in the outside world. La Falda, Cordoba November 1949 {\pos(192,235)}When the war was over, I was about 15 years old. My parents let me go to La Falda... and stay with the Ejhorn family. The Ejhorns were my guardians. They were alone and had no children. They were committed to the Nazis and... even though the government confiscated some of their property... in the post-war purge of the Nazis,... it didn't seem to hurt them. She was very excited and wanted to make sure everything was in order. I did not see when Hitler came to the house. I immediately knew who he was because there were a lot of photos of him in the house. Although they later disappeared. It had the same characteristics as in the photos. I think he wore a wig and didn’t have a mustache. But if he shaved his mustache, don’t say you wouldn’t recognize him. To me, he was like an ordinary man. I didn't notice anything unusual. He was not as low as they said he was. He was tall enough. He had a flushed face and his eyes were kind of bluish. I guess he was the same age as the landlady. About 60. To me, he was already an older man. While he was there, Mrs. Ejhorn went to Hitler's room... to talk and she spent most of the day there. She knew I knew and smiled as if we shared a common secret. It wasn't nice to see him because I knew who he was, but... I wasn't afraid. He ate the same food as everyone else in the house. Typical German dishes. Sausage, ham, vegetables. He drank only water. No one in the house ever drank alcohol. He left his clothes in front of the room, and I took them and cleaned and ironed them. I never did his underwear. He didn't go down to eat in the main dining room... and except for the Ejhorns and me, he didn't show his face. I know a family that visited him in Berlin in the 1930s. They used to show the film drinking tea with him as a special guest. I asked driver Efren,... and he told me it was Hitler, but he also told me... to keep quiet and say nothing. He left the main house and Efren drove him to the ‘castle’. At the top of the Sugarloaf Mountain, near La Falda in Cordoba. Mrs. Ejhorn told me,... El Castillo, Pan Azukar, 1949 'We're going out to lunch today.' El Castillo, Pan Azukar, 1949 Mrs. wanted me to wear something ‘appropriate’. I didn't like it very much. It was very German, without too much style. We made the trip and went with the driver and Mrs. Ejhorn up the mountain. Efren, the driver and I had to stay outside. He said, 'If anyone asks, you have to say we went to Cordoba.' I didn't dare say anything and I had to stay absolutely silent. Efren was my friend,... but he was very serious about the Germans. Comodoro Rivadavia October 1951 In 1951, I worked at the ‘Arustiza and Varando’ clinic. The famous private hospital in Komodoro Rivadavia. A German rancher who was shot was brought to the hospital for treatment. He was not seriously injured. Especially that day, he wanted to look his best. {\pos(192,275)}I remember having to stop myself from shouting. And I rubbed my eyes in astonishment when I saw who it was. I was so scared, I felt shivering. I met Hitler for the first time... while working as a nurse in France in 1940. {\pos(192,280)}And although I didn't have enough opportunity to talk to him,... I've seen him up close a few times. {\pos(192,280)}Hitler got a little old. And he didn't have a mustache. His hair was gray,... but I had no doubt it was him... because of his appearance, the expression of his eyes,... the way he behaved. Trust me,... once seen, Hitler's face is never forgotten. Buenos Aires, Argentina August 1952 I worked in a cafe... {\pos(192,235)}when I first met a man I knew as Ricardo. He hired my brother. He also needed someone to write him letters and documents. He was very charming. And I wanted a change. From that moment on, we became good friends. Ricardo told me he was an important Nazi. And that he arrived in Argentina in 1948 with the help of the Catholic Church. He said he was in the hospital and had rearranged his hair and nose a bit. It could not be noticed. I ended up working for him. He ran businesses from a factory in Buenos Aires. They made refrigerators, but not electric ones. They had gasoline engines and were used on farms in the countryside. He was a tough businessman. Ricardo had 4 or 5 passports. Sometimes he used the name Daniel Dupre from Belgium. He was a very wealthy man. I once saw a $ 400,000 transfer from Europe. He said that he has shares in a factory in Belgium and another in the Netherlands and... a suitable factory in France. He seemed well educated. He dressed appropriately and spoke many languages. He loved music a lot. He also loved to read. He said he had a big house in Germany... in which he had a special room just for listening to music. He always said he would like to show it to me. He sent me flowers,... precious gifts and took me to dinners and dancing to the most expensive places. He loved good food. He wanted us to be lovers, but... I just wanted to be friends. Mar del Plata, Argentina April 1953 I met Hitler several times... when he came to Pavelić's construction sites... in Mar del Plata during the 1950s. I recognized him immediately. Pavelic's wife, Maria Rosa, adored Hitler. It looked the same as in the pictures I saw from the war. He was older, but without a mustache. He was very pale. I heard about Hitler and the war, but never about Pavelic. It was only later that I learned that he had killed almost a million people. Mrs. Hitler has just turned 40 years old. She wore cheap clothes. She gave the impression that she had suffered a lot. She always looked worried and almost never smiled. I have seen Hitler at least 5, maybe 6 times. It's amazing that I remember that he had tame eyes. He didn't have a sharp look. Pavelic, however, had heavy, penetrating, dark eyes. He was a very unpleasant man. The intelligence services had to know that Hitler was in Argentina. They must have protected him. I think the great world powers kept him 'on ice' in case... of a possible war between the United States and Russia. Finally, although he was evil and a monster,... Hitler was followed by the whole of Germany. Hitler and Pavelic also disappeared from Mar del Plate... in August or September 1954. I never saw them again. Buenos Aires, Argentina May 1955 {\pos(192,235)}In addition to its many business interests... Ricardo also sold diamonds in Buenos Aires. He told me he got $120,000 for just one of them. Ricardo brought a lot of precious stones with him from Europe. He also told me that he had a big house and helicopters. He always tried to impress me and take me to bed. He said he slept with many women. He stayed at the Plaza Hotel. I didn't go there. {\pos(192,235)}We were at Peron's house on Teodora Garcia Street. {\pos(192,235)}Ludwig Freud gave it to Peron as a gift when he married Evita. He was with his girlfriend, one of many. I remember someone telling him once,... 'Mr President, she is only 13 years old.' He replied, 'Well what, I'm not superstitious.' He had the answer to everything. Friend Borman! It was not their first meeting. The general used the house for ‘quiet meetings’. It's good, huh? It was just before the 1955 coup. The president was worried, but he tried not to show it. The general intended to invite Bormann to dinner. But Bormann said he could not stay because of other obligations. As it turned out, I was the only one on guard at the house that day. Borman had nothing in his hands when he came,... it was something small. I never saw Bormann again, but I know he stayed at the Plaza Hotel. The police file said that he had a German girl there, Alicia Magnus. Inalco, near Bariloche September 1955 On September 16, 1955, General Peron was overthrown in a military coup. With Peron leaving,... the new government has launched serious investigations in Buenos Aires. Many people were arrested. Property confiscated... and it seemed to be just a matter of time... before the Center is discovered. For the first time, we felt like we were being chased. With the first days of October,... two chiefs arrived at the Center. Hitler still believed that we could get over it. He had complete confidence in Bormann. And although it took more than he hoped... to 'revive' the party's wealth, he was calm. In the end,... what is 10 years in the life of the thousand-year-old Reich? But the news from Bormann was not what the Führer had expected. Borman said that everything has been suspended for now. Everything had to be frozen. And we had to get out of Inalka, fast. I'm the Führer. I'm the Führer! I am the Führer!!! It couldn't last. The girl who traveled all over Europe... and who loved to party and be with friends,... there was a lot of that excommunicated life in the Andes. So she left. The organization will take care of her and the child. {\pos(192,235)}It took us almost a week to destroy all the evidence. The orders were clear. We did not dare to leave any trace of the existence of the Center. Borman's men had already taken away everything of any value. In October, those of us who stayed... they moved to a mountain villa 45 km from the city. It was the end of a dream. La Clara, near Bariloche October 1955 I think Borman had planned it for years. He severed all ties between the Führer and the world. Now only he knew of Hitler's residence. Things did not go the way Hitler dreamed. Bormann knew that every opportunity for open political activity of the Nazis... was finished. Never again will they march proudly under the swastika as before. Camps, Holocaust,... all the dirty secrets of the regime are now despised around the world. Buenos Aires, Argentina October 1955 Borman had other plans for the money they took. People like the Führer would never understand that kind of ambition. They still dreamed of glorious power for a thousand Nazi years. But Bormann knew he could still use the power he had dreamed of. His Fourth Reich will descend on money,... shares and stocks, political influence,... not on ideals. Hitler was practically buried alive. Borman was in charge now. He didn't need the Führer anymore. Now no one knew where he was anymore. They could not come to him and ask him for his opinion and orders. The Führer's time is thus finally over. His health has now begun to deteriorate. He was not a dying man, but he was ill. He began to worry about his health. And he believed that there was a real danger to the organization. During the first months, he suffered from depression. That was to be expected,... since the Führer left Inalko as a man... who still rules the Nazi world. When he came to La Clara, it was all over. On his birthday, April 20, 1956,... I think it was the first time he understood the scale of Borman's betrayal. La Clara, near Bariloche February 1959 The great traitor was now betrayed himself. My Führer. Am I the Führer? In early November, Bormann came to La Clara from Chile. He was greeted coldly by Hitler. But after the meeting they had, Hitler was optimistic again. Bormann stayed for two days. The morning before he left, he met with Pablo. He thanked him for his immeasurable contribution to the common goal... and asked him not to burden Hitler with questions about anything. And to try to get him to live a peaceful life. He told Pablo that the day would come when Hitler would address the world,... but now the most important thing was his health. We knew he was lying. The political life of the Great Führer of the millennial kingdom... is finished. Ejhorn House, La Falda July 1961 {\pos(192,235)}Yes? {\pos(192,235)}Just a moment, please. {\pos(192,235)}Hitler called occasionally, until the early 1960s. I would recognize his voice and ask who was calling,... but he always just said... to let him talk to Mrs. Ejhorn. Oh, my Führer. She called him a cousin. She always spoke, even after Hitler's alleged death,... 'My cousin travels'. They are the ones who paid everything for him. They supported him financially. He was often in contact with these people. Mrs. Ejhorn obliged me to promise to keep quiet. She said, 'You saw absolutely nothing of what was happening.' She didn't have to say anything more than that. The Germans did not play. It was serious. It's best to keep quiet and forget about it. After all, I loved them. They were good to me. It wasn't until they died that I felt I could tell what had happened. At that moment, Efren had already gone to live in Germany. La Clara, near Bariloche, December 1961 Here in the mountains I saw his spirit flourishing again. But his nervous system was permanently damaged. Morel can be blamed for that with his charlatan medicine... and dangerous injection treatment. Melancholy became his usual condition. Little by little, we removed ourselves from external events. Only two people now lived with him permanently. His assistant Pablo Gloknik and I. Oh God, help me. At times I felt a strange pleasure... because of that man's terrible suffering. It seemed to me that all that immeasurable blood... which is shed longing for revenge on Hitler... from the very arteries of the Earth. We are a strange group, exiled. Hitler, a monstrous dictator who is now without a mask and uniform,... Pablo, a man who looked like he died a long time ago... and finally me, the old, forgotten doctor... who found himself in the final phase of his life in circumstances... which are inevitably just too much for him. Hitler tried to return to his old passion, painting. But his hands just weren't capable of that. It doesn't look like Parkinson's to me. It is probably the return of the scarlet fever he had at the end of the first war. Whatever caused it made him even more depressed. He was in a state close to collapse. He spends hours just watching the horizon of lakes and mountains... like an obsessed man. His physical condition occasionally took on worrying features. He complained of sharp, neuralgic pain in his face,... caused by a poorly performed operation. Migraines became stronger and lasted longer. I don't know if the attacks were caused by his mental or physical condition. Both bring him close to his final end. The Führer's condition was approaching an elementary critical point. Nothing more can be done, except to wait... while the ghosts of Auschwitz, Buchenwald, Treblinka and so many other places... don't drag him out of his life. He had been suffering from hallucinations for several nights. He told me to see disfigured faces,... fields covered with corpses,... friends and enemies who rise to accuse him of trembling movements. He can barely sleep. Visions haunt him endlessly. He refuses to eat and spends hours between sobs... remembering his childhood. Pablo! He seems to have suffered a heart attack today. Dr. Lehmann! Dr. Lehmann! I can do a little for him now. I have few resources here for him. Nothing more can be done. Life leaves him naturally and quickly. Morphine keeps him calm and quiet. February 13, 1962 at 3 p.m.,... I confirmed the absence of life in the Führer's body. He went to join the millions of beings he had condemned to death. I don't think there is much left... before I join him in hell. 'My honor is loyalty.' It is now 23 years since I first uttered those words. 'I swear to you, Adolf Hitler,...' '... as the leader and chancellor of the nation, to loyalty and courage.' 'I swear to you and the deputies you have appointed...' '... to obedience to death,...' '... so God helped me.' I always thought my own death would... release my oath. One last duty. It was the least I could do. So, at least they're still safe. Forever imprisoned by their identity of course,... but still safe. Under Borman, things will be different. New Germany is already being born. Strong again. Buenos Aires, Argentina September 1962 {\pos(192,235)}He knew Peron and Evita... {\pos(192,235)}and he always said that Evita was more intelligent than Juan Domingo. I stopped seeing him just before the factory closed. I found another job. But I still saw him sometimes in our old places... until 1957. Mutual friends say... that he continued to live in Buenos Aires until 1960,... when that other Nazi Eichmann was captured. I tried to contact Ricardo,... but he was no longer there. I was flipping through a Spanish magazine, and here it is. But the article was about Martin Borman. I immediately recognized Ricardo. When I compared the photo... with the one I made at a restaurant in Buenos Aires,... I realized that Ricardo did something with his hair. He looked a little different than in Borman's photo. But it was, no doubt, his eyes. Ricardo? I knew they were looking for him,... but I didn't want to go to the police... because he was a good friend of mine... and I was afraid he might be killed. Once I found out who he really was, I got scared myself. After all, most of the world thought Martin Borman was dead. Buenos Aires, Argentina December 1985 Come in, please. Sit down. Thanks. Sometime in 1985, that woman came to the office. She was a little younger than me. Blue, tall, well dressed. She came to the office three times. I remember her very well. She came to ask for help. She said that she had problems with documents about false identity... and that she was married to a German, a former Nazi who was also... was in a country with fake papers. He beat her. She now lived in Bariloche. Her mother lived in Bariloche until the early 1980s... when she moved to Buenos Aires. I'm sure that woman was normal. She didn't look mentally ill to me. She was completely normal and how she behaved. She seemed very normal, lucid and reasonable to me. She had no reason to invent anything. Buenos Aires, Argentina March 2008 I wrote the book ‘Hitler Died in Argentina’ in 1987. It happened after a chance meeting with Pablo Glochnik. {\pos(192,235)}We became good friends... {\pos(192,235)}and I've been waiting 10 years since Pablo's death... {\pos(192,235)}as I promised him, before I published the book. I came in contact again... with old family friend Lina Rufinengo. We lived next to her and her husband Oswald... in Bolson near the Andes in the 80s. Osvaldo is dead now,... but he was a very close associate of the Perons. And once he showed me a letter from Borman thanking him for his help. In essence, he organized Argentine passports for the Nazis. I didn't think about it anymore... until later that night when the phone rang. {\pos(192,275)}Hello? I admit it scared me. Not for myself, but for my wife and my family. I tried to contact Lin... and find out if she knows anything about it,... but she traveled across the sea to Germany the next day. Mar Chikita, Argentina November 2008 {\pos(192,235)}Of course I knew the Hitlers. {\pos(192,235)}Many of us are. They visited Cordoba often after the war. I knew him as Adolf. I remember that he often looked far away and lost in thought. I asked various friends... do they still have pictures with him from after the war,... from the fifties. I also remember him signing books. Then a phone call followed. Hello? The problem they say is that Eva is still alive. But that would be pointless. She would be 96 today. Buenos Aires, Argentina November 2008 History tells us that Adolf Hitler went crazy... committed suicide in a bunker in Berlin,... in 1945 with his wife Eva. Rumors spread about his daughter, Ushi. Brother-in-law Eve Brown, SS General Herman Fegelein,... was allegedly executed before a court in Berlin in the autumn. History also tells us that Martin Bormann,... known as the Brown Eminence... and the man Hitler said he needed to win the war,... died in Berlin in an attempt to escape in 1945. And that his body was found in 1972. And that was confirmed by the DNA analysis of the German Government in 1998. History does not tell us... that Adolf Hitler lived in Argentina... with his wife Eva and their child. But these people, all whose testimonies are true,... they swear it's true. Carmen Torrentugvi took care of him, his family and friends... on the San Ramon estate in 1945. Olga Miller and many other people saw him and Eva at the Vienna Hotel in Mar Chikita... and other places in the province of Cordoba in 1946. In 2008, she was told that the Gestapo was still active... and that her life is in danger because of talking to us. Catalina Gomero spent weeks in 1948 serving him... on two estates owned by the Ejhorn family in Cordoba,... La Falda and Pan Azukar. She received calls from him until 1962. Mafalda Batinik saw him for the second time in her life in 1951... at a clinic in Comodoro Rivadavia. It was first in France in 1940. Hernan Ansin met him in Mar del Plata five times in 1953,... when he worked for the Croatian Ustasha monster Ante Pavelić. Pablo Gloknik, former sailor with 'Count Spe',... was part of his security from 1946 to 1962. Dr. Otto Lehmann was his personal physician at the same time. Many people have seen submarines... which unloaded on the coast of Patagonia in 1945. Their testimonies are well documented in Argentina. They also include two officers from ‘Count Spe’. The FBI had eyewitnesses to Hitler's arrival,... but they never did anything. The man who allegedly led the trial for Herman Fegelein,... SS General Wilhelm Monk,... says the last time he saw him he was alive and well. Fegelein's father said that he often called him after the war... to tell him that he and the Führer are in Argentina and that they are fine. Alicia Oliveira, a partner lawyer from Buenos Aires,... tells us she met Hitler's daughter. In 2008, Captain Manuel Monasterio,... who recorded the testimonies of Pablo and Dr. Lehmann,... received a death threat as a result of our research. Martin Bormann arrived in Argentina in 1948. Pablo saw him in Inalka. Jorge Coloto met him in 1955 when Juan Domingo Perón... welcomed his longtime friend... and paid his hotel bill in Buenos Aires. Araceli Mendes worked for him in Buenos Aires... and spent almost three years refusing his courtship. She saved his pictures. Argentine federal police kept files on Borman.
