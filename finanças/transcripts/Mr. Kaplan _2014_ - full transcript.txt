My name is Jacob Kaplan. This is Rebecca. What is he doing? We've been married for 50 years. Jacob! Jacob! Get down from there! Get down! 1937, Sosnowiec, Poland. My parents named me Jacob, like the biblical patriarch who fought with an angel and was blessed by God. Yankev Kaplan. You've been named after the Patriarch Jacob. May God also reserve an exceptional destiny for you. And help you illuminate your life and inspire your community. My son... You are very special. Now go, and show it. But, did I inspire anybody in any way? Will any history book mention that Jacob Kaplan escaped from Europe by himself? Life hasn't been easy. You must head up north. You'll find a harbour. Buy a ticket. And embark towards America. And you? Yankele, we will follow you afterwards. And we'll meet you there. My son, from now on you'll be responsible... ...for your actions and destiny. Don't ever look back. Sometimes I wonder: Did I accomplish anything memorable? Is the world a better place because of me? How useful was I? I'm not young anymore... Goethe published Faust II at 81. Winston Churchill was Prime Minister for the second fame at 77. And Abraham received God's calling at 75. Come on... Come on... Careful... Turn the wheel... Turn it. - Come on old man... Come on... Get out and push, grandpa... Come on, everyone's waiting... I'm sorry. There's no Mr. and Mrs. Kaplan. This can't be. There must be a mistake. Do you have invitations? Excuse me. Simon Lamstein? Table eight. - Thank you. We need to make room for two more. Let's move in. Thanks. Hello. Excuse me. My apologies. The lists got mixed up. Never mind. These things happen. Mimi. Mazel Tov! I heard it's a boy. Thank you. When are you due? Jul)'- The family is growing. And you, Yankele? Isn't Isaac thinking about expanding the family? How old is your daughter-in-law? How should I know? The other day I saw your other son, Elias. The artist. - Is he still trying to write? He writes, but it takes time to get something good. And what is he writing about? I don't know. Yankele's son is an intellectual. What he writes, you wouldn't be able to understand. At least I didn't take a writing course. I didn't take a course. I started one. And I quit when I finished the book. It might not be a masterpiece like Yankele's son's, but it's finished. I bet you I publish sooner. You took a writing course? Yeah, he took one. Taking a course is stupid. Writing is something you either can or can't do. It's like swimming or breathing. What do you mean, swimming or breathing? There's no merit in it. You do it because you do it. Yankele... but you can't swim. I can't, but if I had to, I would. It's the survival instinct that makes you swim. Get down from there right now! Are you listening to me? Jacob! Jacob! Jacob! Yankele! Why don't we take a cab? - I said "no". Let's call Isaac to come pick us up. Leave Isaac alone. Jacob, I'm fine! My car... Jacob! Son of a bitch! What are you doing? Jacob! What did you do, you shithead? You wrecked my car! Kaplan! SS in Uruguay... under a straw hat, enjoying a papaya juice with a straw. SS in Uruguay... under the burning sun Memories beset me, AV, av, ay... Those morons... they want to extradite me, but I have no doubt, I'm not picking up the bill. SS in Uruguay... My boys are close by they obey my finger, and my We' Hello. Wilson! Contreras! Wilson! What's up? Yeah. Who? I have an agreement with Wilson. The money issue is between you and me. If anyone has questions, now's the time. Will he be using the car? Why can't I keep it? You don't have a license, Lottie. How long were you in the police? Three years. You got fired? - No, no, I quit. Why? Because he wanted to, Elias. How are your children? - Fine! Growing up, the five of them. Five children! My Nereida is 15 this year. We'll have her Quinceañera party. You'll be invited. You know, my dad always said he never met a man as fair as Mr. Jacob. He remembered everything he did for us, when he gave him a job... Wilson, my dad is not aware of this yet. Dad. Dad, come here. Do you remember Wilson? It's Libardo's son. How are you, Mr. Jacob? Thank God, each day a bit worse. Dad, Wilson and the family are here talking... We've decided it's best he takes care of your car. You call him, and he'll pick you up, he can take you anywhere. We think it's the best option. Dad... Dad! The guy was a cop. He spent years in a patrol car. I'm sure he drives just fine. Speak louder, Dad can't hear well. Dad. The guy was a cop. I heard you! I don't need a driver. I can take a taxi. Isaac wants to pay for it. It's much better. He can pick you up whenever you want. Isaac has enough with his father-in-law. I can take care of myself. If no one uses the car, can I? Shut up, kiddo. What if you drive him? Me? - Yeah, you. You think I'm a plant? You have spare time. "Spare time"... "Spare time"! I have a life too, in case you didn't know. Did you talk to Spillman? - Yeah. Will he publish you? I don't know. These things take time. They don't happen overnight. Can't you help him? They already met... Maybe, if he knew you're brothers he could help him. Did you tell him you are Isaac's brother? Did you tell him or not? So what's your story about? What's my story about? You think it's a school essay? No, surely it's not a school essay. You've been at it for ten years. Alright... He's very sensitive. Kafka was sensitive too, you know? And he still worked. 12 hours in an insurance company. If Kafka could do it, maybe you can too. Anyone wants more mashed potatoes? Give me some more. May I have a cigarette? - What? May I have a cigarette? I don't smoke. Neither do I. How long does this take to kill you? Are you in a rush? What do you want the car for? You don't even have a license. Now you don't either. Do you drive? - Sometimes. When my friend borrows the car. Where do you go with your friend? I don't know. Around. Sometimes we go to the beach, past Atlántida, to the German's beach. Which German? - A German who owns a bar. He's an old guy. An old guy like me? He's about 80. We call him "the Nazi". Lottie, don't joke around with that. Grandpa, this is Uruguay, it's all good. It was all good in Germany. And look what happened there. Yankele, it's your turn. H. L. E. Z.T.-Ok. Now cover your other eye, please. H. L. E. I said the other eye, sir. H. L. E. Are you cheating? Are you going to let me read, or not? I've been driving for 50 years. And no stupid doctor will tell me what I can or can't do. Take me to the Board of Medicine, we'll appeal. - Come on, Dad... The guy humiliated me! You should have heard him. We have to sue him. This guy can't have a license. I can't right now. I've got a meeting. You need to calm down! Calm down? I won't be able to drive because of this schmuck! Don't worry. We'll sort it out. Calm down. Channel 12 Travels brings us to southern Italy. Sicily's millennial history, with its fascinating historical and artistic heritage, which we find in every corner of the island. If you act like a duck, talk like a duck, and walk like a duck, how do you think people will perceive you? Together, we start right here. We find... ...the 5 secrets of the Art of living. ...Bengoechea runs down the wing... Signed an agreement stating that the Russian Federation and the United States will share information to reduce the risk of an accidental retaliation from Moscow. Moving onto other issues, a French newspaper reported a suspected Nazi living under a fake identity in the Amazon rainforest. Some teenager found by chance the whereabouts of the 85 year-old man. He was living alone under a fake name, in a humble ranch. The old criminal was leading a Nazi organization called "Aurora", working undercover in South America, and he is supposed to have arrived in the "Stern", the famous German ship that illegally arrived in Buenos Aires full of Nazi officers running away from the III Reich collapse. This could be the most important case since Adolf Eichmann's capture in Buenos Aires in 1960. In Sports, tomorrow will see the suspended match between Peñarol and Defensor Sporting... Lottie? Who's calling? Grandpa? Yes, it's me. Lottie, that German you mentioned, "The Nazi". Grandpa, are you OK? It's 6 AM! Why do you call him that way? I don't know, Gramps! He's an old man who walks around the beach by himself all day... Is Grandma OK? Yes, she's fine... I'm sorry, Lottie. I got confused. Go back to sleep. I'm sorry. I only have 40. It's been a while since I've taken a cab. Old prick. What happened? Where's the third one? What's up? Walter! It ate my ball. Another coin? Get outta here, Wilson, it's 6 AM. Don't bust my balls. I'm telling you, it's broken! I was on the second ball, man. Yeah? Jacob who? Jacob Kaplan. Tell me, how long until you are ready? It's urgent. Where are we heading? Just take off. I'll explain to you later. Are we there yet, Jacob? Just follow me, Wilson. Ice cream! Ice cream, Mr. Jacob? Chocolate cassata? Popsicle? - Please! I'm doing something important here. Tell me what he's reading. Who? - That GUY- I don't get it. It's in some weird language. Tell me what you see, I'll handle the understanding. Di... pe... "Diepest." The Plague. He's reading The Plague. Wanna grab a bite? I won't give a dime to that criminal. Which criminal? At "Estrella's"? Did you say "Estrella"? Where did you get that from? - Over there. Estrella, huh? Listen to me, Wilson. If it moves like a duck, walks like a duck, and sounds like a duck, what is it? There's a catch, right? This is a very delicate case. A case? An investigation. They sent you to investigate? It's confidential. You can't tell a soul. And this confidential case, is your son aware of it? He has nothing to do with it. In 1945, a Nazi ship arrived, escaping from Germany. Do you know what the name of that ship was? "Stern". German for "Estrella". You were a cop. You get me. No... I suspect that that old guy... ...is a Nazi. This guy isn't clean. He's hiding something. Weird. It's very weird. Long sleeves in this hot weather. Is that all you have to say? I show you a dangerous criminal and all you can say is "long sleeves"? Were you a cop or a tailor? Excuse me. The bill. Explain this: Why is an educated and refined German selling frozen fish in a dump like this? This is a front. Thank God, where were you? We were about to call the police, where were you? I went to pay the land taxes and got held up. The land taxes expired two years ago. Business. What business? - Listen to me: After 50 years I still have to tell you about my business? Invite you to think about the dangers that we confront even at the end of the 20th Century. A French weekly reported the existence of a runaway Nazi, living under a false identity in South America. Let him be killed and rot in hell. He should be sliced into pieces and thrown into the ocean. I prefer him to be alive, so he can be put to trial in Israel and answer for his crimes. What for? So he can be locked up for life, and on top of that have kosher food on us? Our enemies never had any problem identifying us. But, do we know who we are? When WWII was over, Adolf Eichmann, one of the major players in the Jewish extermination had disappeared. In 1960, Simon Wiesenthal and the Israel's Secret Service, located him in Argentina and devised a three-part plan. 1 - CAPTURE 2 - GUARD 3 - TRANSFER In secret, to be tried in Israel. Got the money? Ok. Enough. What are you up to, Wilson? No. I'd rather not know. Got the money? Let me be clear. I'm only doing this for my sister. I warned her. I told her marrying you was a fuck up. But, here we are... I'll meet you with everything in an hour. Workers from Funsa prevented the admission of new staff. Disproportionate increases in meat retail prices have been reported. Pensioners protested before the Ministry of Economic Affairs. They demand payment of their bonus before Christmas. During the last three days, Uruguay has seen the highest levels of UV radiation ever recorded in the last few years. Police and Intelligence record: Name and Surname: Julius Reich. Place of Birth: Berlin, Germany. Date of Birth: September 6th, 1913. Marital Status: Single. Profession: Businessman. Admittance to the country: July 17th, 1951. Place: Rivera, border with Santana do Livramento, Brazil. Perfect. What do you mean, "perfect"? It says that he came in through Brazil not Argentina. And 6 years after the "Stern", the ship you said that brought him. This document is a jewel... Good jewels are valuable for what they hide, not for how much they shine. This must be a second entry, when he entered from Brazil with fake documents and new name. Transformed into a smart businessman: Julius Reich. This is the restaurant's business registry. "German-born Julius Reich, sole owner of the restaurant La Estrella, founded in 1954. Corporate purposes: to develop activities in the field of catering and tourism... A small business... Not even a fake business to evade taxes. So much humility is weird. This smells fishy. Hand me the documents. Police records: clean. Not clean, white washed. But rest assured, we'll soon stain them. He doesn't even have a house to his name. See how careful he is? He also had another society in the water pumps business with a partner: Otto Muller. German born, but registered with an American passport. How is that possible? North America gave papers to a lot of German scientists in exchange for knowledge. Just an innocent, routine morning swim. There is no innocent routine. He who repeats the same movements, does so for a reason. Maybe he's just exercising. You think it's not a big deal for that criminal to exercise? It's bad news when guys like these start exercising. Morning. Boss, do you know La Estrella's owner? Julio? - Yes, Julio. Get me a beer. I want to ask you a couple of questions. Fine. You OK? Jacob. Jacob Kaplan. Listen to me carefully... Lord? I Am who I Am. And You are who You'll be. You will be who You were. If you were who You are. What? I Am who I Am. Out of all the men... Jacob Kaplan... Listen to me carefully... The Beach Boys became one of the most important pop culture bands, and one of the most influential, innovative and admired in modern music history. Thanks to what? To thew wonderful melodies and harmonies, featured in their masterpiece: Pet Sounds. With Brian Wilson on the lead, a genius twentieth century composer and producer, the Beach Boys are a clear representation of life on the beach, the joy, the youth... What is the summer? The Beach Boys. One more beer? Anything I can eat? - What do you want? Whatever you got... Mr. Jacob! Are you alright? You're on fire! You'll have to pour some vinegar. - Idiot. Four hours under the sun and you're drunk. I drink only for professional purposes. Lesson No. 1 as a cop: "bars are the places to get leads". And this little number was $200. Not that I want to charge you. But money issues are tough with my wife. My daughter's Quinceañera party. Women, huh? "All this Nazi chasing, but no money to show." You told your wife? Just the highlights. "The highlights." Jacob, where are you going? Jacob! Jacob! Mr. Jacob, don't get mad! This is a secret operation and you tell your wife! My wife doesn't listen to me... That's why you got fired from the Police? What about when we capture him? Are you gonna get drunk and tell everybody? Don't worry, it's all good. It's a secret mission. If people find out... we're kidnapping him to take him to Israel, the whole operation goes to hell. Kidnapping? Us? Kidnapping? That big guy? Us? You have no idea what a kidnapping is, Jacob! Sure, you're 80. You can't go to jail at 80! But I have 5 kids. What about my future? Your future? You didn't look in the mirror... What future are you talking about? Your father would be ashamed if he raised from the grave. Future... The agents who captured Eichmann, they did have a future! But you? Wilson? What are you doing? Where are you going? Wilson! Wilson! Wilson! Idiot! For your wife. My wife is gonna love them. They went out, but they'll see them when they get back. And I wasn't fired from the Police because of what you said. My brother-in-law got me the job. My wife was happy and I had to be thankful. I was paid for doing nothing. Doing nothing and saying nothing. Instead of working with him I worked for Ham. He charged for protection. And I went with him to collect. Until someone reported it. I took all the charges to save my brother-in-law. And I was out of a job. He gives me some compensation now and then. You're right. What kind of future does a screw-up like me have? You picked the wrong partner. Wilson... You're not just anyone. You're Wilson Contreras, son of Libardo Contreras. I'm sorry for everything I said. You're a good man. And your father would be very proud. And that brother-in-law of yours... ...we'll shut him up from Israel. How are we taking him there? By ship. I can't swim. - Neither can I. Look Jacob, What is this? I found something out at the bar. The German has a daughter. Her name is Estrella. She works at a night club. They haven't spoken for years. Ms. Estrella Reich? Full service 220, blowjob 50. If daddy wants to look, 50 more. We only came to talk. - We are talking. My name is Harry Steinberg. We work for Kauffman and Ross Kn“. We've been looking for you a long time. Actually time is relative. So what's up? It's a European issue. Do you know Mr. Beckenbauer? You've never heard of Beckenbauer? - No. It's a shame. This complicates things. What things? We're investigating Mr. Beckenbauer's lineage. Looking for his great granddaughter. His heiress. Estrella, where can we speak more privately? I'll ask a few questions, and we tick them off. The more ticks we have... ...the closer we get to Beckenbauer. Your father came in from Germany... You weren't born in Uruguay! She wasn't? - Of course she wasn't. No, I wasn't born in Uruguay. Is that a problem? - Not at all. I was born in Maracaibo, Venezuela. Why? Tell the truth! What do you mean "Why"? People are born where they can, not where they want to. So you came from Venezuela. No. From Brazil. Running away from what? "Running away"? From the heat? Can we keep a line of order? Who has the questions here?e Who's ticking? May I go to the bathroom? Thanks Estrella, very kind. I apologize for my partner. He's not used to field work. I'm the specialist. So, who's this? Beckenbauer. He was the Kaiser of Prussia States. Do you know Prussia, Estrella? Half of Prussia... ...was Beckenbauer's. This investigation was extremely complicated. It's hard to follow a trail in Prussia. No tracks. There are so many barriers... ...the language barrier... ...the weather barrier... ...it snows every day. Inhospitable. Be right back. Yeah. What happened? What do you mean Otto died? Where's the wake? Which street? Will my father be there? No, I can't be there in the afternoon. I'll call his family later. Thanks. "...by her father: Joseph... ...Reherman. Father's name: Julius Reich." He changed his name... So... Any more questions? One last thing. When was the last time you saw your father? Any childhood memories? Like what? Any black & white memories? Any swastikas? Who are you two? Why were you looking for me? What do you want? - Just to know... Know what? - About Beckenbauer. Who are you, fatso? I'm from Kauffman Intl. Where's your ID? Your card? There was no time to print cards. Where's your dad? Where's your dad? Who? Get out of here! Get out of my house! Get out of here, fatso! Take your Daddy with you! Why are you here? Venezuela and Brazil. You see? He was fleeing from Wiesenthal! We are on to something! Fuck! The Police! Shit! Don't worry, I'll handle this one. Listen... What if the German called the restaurant "Estrella" because of his daughter? Listen, there's one important thing here... there was a first "Estrella", and that was the ship. It doesn't matter if it was the daughter or the restaurant... Leave things alone. Stop trying to confuse me. Good evening, officer. - Good evening. Driver's license. I had it a week ago, but a stupid doctor... License, sir! Aren't you listening? I told you I had it. Rodriguez, I need back up. Leave that radio alone! Can't we talk about it? Sir, your driver's license. You're interfering with an international undercover mission. Step out of the vehicle, sir. - Officer. Do I know you? No? From the neighbourhood? Weren't you at the 10th headquarter? You're a cop. No. You put my brother in jail. You put him in jail at the 10th. This man is confused. Tonight, I'll fuck you up the ass. Fucking Pig- Is that him? Yes, that's him. What are you doing here, Dad? What's going on, Dad? Say something! Did you talk to Contreras? Yeah. I asked him to keep away from Dad. Good. He's smoking! - What? Dad is smoking! Why are you smoking in the car? Since when do you smoke? Lottie. You wanted the car? It's yours. Hello. What's wrong, Wilson? I already paid you this month. You know what time it is? I wanna see my wife. My sister is fine without you. Jacob! Jump in! Today we ride like kings! I stole it from my brother-in-law. Look. He is missing an arm. The war! "In gratitude for your great collaboration. Our condolences. Milestone Co. North Augusta, Washington... This Otto Muller must have been a big fish. What do you need? We came to offer our condolences. Your name? My name is Harry Steinberg. Hans... Schneider. Hans Schneider. That's it. Julius Reich. DISTINGUISHED CITIZEN What a man, Mr. Otto... What a terrible loss. - Yes. Especially like this, so suddenly. He'd been in bed for over two years. Yeah, but he wasn't that old. He was 80 years old. 80 years, huh? Time really does fly by. Did you know him when he arrived? No I was a child. But I heard stories. The first week he got here he fixed the town's water pump so everyone could have water. That was before his water pump business. He knew more about mechanics than anyone I've met. He did more work than 30 men together. Hans Schneider. Jacob? - Hans Schneider. You have to wait. Do not hesitate to call me for anything you may need. My heartfelt sympathy. Thank you. Excuse me... Who are you? I'm... Hans Schneider. An old friend of Otto's. How amazing this Otto. Coming from Germany without his arm. What arm? The arm. He lost his arm in Montevideo. I held him in very high esteem. Thank you so much. I never saw anyone work like him. Especially, with his arm missing. I'm here if you need anything. Excuse me. What did you say your name was? Hans Schneider. And where did you say you met my father? Where else? At the water pumps. When did you last hear of him? About... 30 years ago. You're one lying old man, huh? You never knew my father. You've just amputated his arm 20 years before he lost it in the factory. Who are you? What are you doing here? - Let's go. What happened, Jacob? - Let's take off! Is everything alright? - Hit it. Get down! Hit it! - Get out, son of a bitch, out! Get out! - Did you come to cause trouble? Get out! - Let's go! Stop, you son of a bitch! You'll collect my father's debts in fucking hell! Am I too late? Where were you? What? I asked you a question. What's going on? I've located the gang's leader. A gang? What gang? A German guy. A Nazi. A Nazi? He lives in a beach bar... ...but it's a front. - A what? They don't even sell fresh fish. I'm going to call Isaac. Let Isaac worry about finding clients for his father-in-law, and I'll take care of Israel's enemies. What if something happens to you? What about me? Rivkele, when we leave this world and the millions of victims ask us, "what have we done?"... ...we will be able to say: "We haven't forgotten you". That's not my line. It's Simon Wiesenthal's. But I'll say it anyway. Fucking thief! You're stealing cars now? I'll put you in jail! Cut it out! Don't touch me! Don't touch me! I don't want your help or your money! You get it? You still have that shitty job because of me! I'm gonna see my kids now! Dad? Son. When are we going home? Soon my love. Go to sleep. You're going where? Things will change, sweetie. Come back when you're sober. I am sober. This is different. It's big. It'll change our lives. We'll move to a decent neighbourhood. I was raised here, I'm fine. It's for the kids. You know? Nereida's 15. Who will she marry in the future? My children will be happy where I am. And when she marries, she'll be better with someone like her, and they'll be even. Dad? Honey. You woke up. What are you doing here? Nothing, honey. Your Quinceañera party... ...we'll have it at the Sheraton. Don't tell mom, OK? It's a surprise. ...and we close the programme with this piece in F major by Anton Rubinstein. It's 1.57 a.m. and we wish you a pleasant evening. Yankele. Yankele! Yankele. Yan... Yankele... Yankele! Yankele! Yankele! Hi Mom. How's Dad? Has the doctor said anything? We are still waiting. The arteries are obstructed. The blood pressure is variable. The picture is not encouraging. Is there anything we can do? If I could give you some advice... don't tell him anything. Let him be, in a family environment. Living peacefully the time he's got left. Good afternoon. Nicolas Gutierrez. Office 3. Good afternoon. Interview in office 2. Wilson Contreras. Wilson Contreras? Manuel Pouso. Born Regina! Kenneth Dwight, Elton John forms his artistic name from the conjunction of the names of Elton Dean and Long John Baldly, sax player and vocalist of Bluesology, a band where Elton was leader. December 8th... THE EICHMANN CASE EICHMANN TO FACE TRIAL. EICHMANN DEMANDS GERMANY'S PROTECTION. No, no, wait! Don't go. No! Easy! I'm Wilson! Wilson Contreras! Jacob's friend. Easy. I gotta talk to you, OK? - Wilson. You've gotta help me. It's about your grandpa. Thank you, Lottie. Is very important for your grandpa to spend time with family right now. Sure, Grandma. Call me if anything happens. - Yeah. Bye. You have a nice family. They look out for you. I tried to reach you, but they didn't let me. Look, Mr. Jacob... ...I'm gonna say this just once. Eichmann was captured getting off a bus. He was held for 10 days. Then he was carried while sedated, dressed as a pilot. So? So if you still want to... ...we can do it much better. Wilson... Blessed are the eyes laid upon you. We'll wait in Rio Grande. I got a cabin in the outskirts, well hidden. I got a boat ready. I talked to a friend in customs. He's gonna get us out. And I got a passport. Simon Feldman Rodoszyce. August 14th, 1933. 33? It should be 23. There's little resemblance. We'll need a little make up, but everything's covered. If they stop us, I got a medical certificate. Terminal Alzheimer's. Signed by a friend. Certified doctor. And there's also my diploma. It looks so good I feel like practicing. And the sleeping drugs? I got them from the Zoo's vet. Wilson Contreras... Your name shall engrave itself in Israel's memory. You shall be blessed in God's eyes, and blessed shall your descendants be until the end of time. But I don't have money for the tickets. Money? Money for the tickets? 3,000. 3,000 isn't enough. 5,000 minimum. It's a 20-year-old car. Four. - No. 3,000 is fine! Fine, I'll get the paper work. 3,000 is perfect. Lottie. You need to know that what you did... It's nothing, Grandpa. It's of the utmost importance to the Jewish people. I thought it was important to you. Look, as long as you don't tell anyone, feel free. Think of all the challenges we've been through. It's 4,000 years of history. Cut it with the 4,000 years of history. I got enough with my 18 of life. I have little time left. I'll soon be on to the other world. What are you talking about? Bad grass never dies. Rivkele... Do you love me? What? I'm asking if you love me. What is it, Yankele? I asked you something. I loved you when you couldn't speak Spanish and used to sell carpets. What kind of question is that? We've been together for 50 years. Yankele? Yankele. Why did you call us? Dad... Do you know what Dad's doing? Yeah. Mom, let him. A couple of cigarettes at this point... He's also smoking? Mom, we didn't want you to worry... First he wants to kidnap a Nazi to take him to Israel, and on top of that, smoking? Say that again? Mom, where is Dad? Do you have popsicles? Hands off! Go, go! Hey! Come here fatso! What did you do to my daughter? She's crying. - What? Stop! Calm down! - Coward! Who are you? Who sent you? Don't move! 50 years... ...and I still can't escape from Auschwitz. The next time I see you... ...I'll kill you. Wilson? How strong was the dose? How should I know? Where are you taking me? Where are you taking me? Where you can answer for your crimes. Crimes? What are you talking about? You'll have plenty of time to tell the judges about everything you did in Auschwitz. Auschwitz... In Auschwitz I did what I had to do to survive. You think I'm a traitor just because I chose to save myself. My parents and siblings didn't have that chance. But what I still can't understand, is why anyone would still want revenge? Who gives a damn about an almost dead Kapo? If it hadn't been me... it would have been any other Jew out there. I've been running away like a rat for 50 years. But it's over. I'm old and tired. No more running away for Julius Reich. No! What's wrong, Mr. Jacob? I don't understand! We must untie him. What's wrong? You thought the tattoo had worn off? They took me in the fall of '42. One day they come and offer you the job. Everyone calls you a traitor. A collaborator. But it's the only way to survive. Everyone else ends up in the gas chamber. Then, I tried to start over. I started a new family. I changed my name. But soon you realize something. You can't escape from the past. No matter how much you hide from it... ...it always finds you. What's your plan with me now? Did you really jump not knowing how to swim? Buy some furniture for your house and throw Nereida a nice Quinceañera party. No, Jacob, no. I'm sorry, Wilson. You must make an effort, Jacob. You must get back to reality. I am in reality. Go back home, get your family back, that's reality. And don't let anyone take you away from it. So what? What about everything we found out? Doesn't it mean anything? The only real lead... ...were the long sleeves. Underneath those sleeves was the whole truth. The rest was a fairy tale. You were right to doubt everything I said. You were always right, Wilson. Rebecca... Rebecca! Grandpa? What's wrong, Grandpa? Hello? - I'm sorry. Jeanette! Jeanette! Jeanette! Hi... I want you to come back home. You know what, Rebecca? I almost went into the wrong house!
