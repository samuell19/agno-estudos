Oh God, you scared me! - What are you doing? You're the one awake in the middle of the night! - [laughing] Sorry Gina, I mean, were we being too loud, we can totally try to like calm it down a little. - Yeah. We were just picking out our first day of school outfits. - It's okay. - Thanks, sorry. - What's that for? - I just wanted to make sure you had one for school. - Mom, I'm covered, okay? I have extra acetamezopine and my lorazepam pen. Honor student, remember? Dean's list. I'm good, I promise. - I can take it. Just in case. - Thank you, Toni. - You're welcome. - It's so great you guys were able to transfer together. Yeah, Kelsey wouldn't know what to do without you. - [laughs] Well, it's not like we're in the same classes, but-- - Oh, God, T, Just give it a month. We're gonna get you in those AP classes, okay? - Yeah, not likely, but thanks. - All right guys, don't stay up too late, okay? - Okay. - Okay. - Okay, we won't promise, promise. - I promise. - I'm serious. - Okay, okay, goodnight. - [Kelsey] Goodnight. - Ooh!

I just need those execution documents for the Ridgeside property. - Um, they're in your purse, Mom. - Oh. Ah, all right, let's roll! - Okay! Ah! - [Gina] Come on, girls, let's go!

It's a pool thing, I think. - Mm, like a pool party? - It's pretty casual I think. - Are her parents gonna be there? - Yeah, for sure. - Toni, you're going too? - Mm-hmm. I wouldn't let her go alone, so. [laughs] - Yeah, no, I, it's, I guess it's fine. Gosh, you guys. You're just growing up so fast, I can hardly keep up! [laughing] [camera clicks] - We got this. We got this. Yeah. Um, this is my friend, Toni. - Hi. - Hi, Toni. This is my buddy Augustine. - Hey, what's up? - You guys want some margs? - [Both] Yeah, sure. - [Toni] Thank you. - Mm, spicy! - My secret ingredient is extra jalapenos. - Oh. - Just uh, don't tell anyone, okay? - Okay. - All right. - [Girl] Jason, get over here. - I'll see you guys later. - Okay. - Okay. - Okay, this is literally just alcohol. - It's not exactly like the parties at our old school. - Okay, like we went to any parties at our old school. [laughs] Well, what about your Mom? There's no parents here. - Sure about that? - Wow, of course she has cool parents. She's literally perfect. - T, am I sensing a little jealousy? - No, no, no! Not at all, no. - Okay, well let's at least try and have some fun, okay? - [Toni] All right, okay! - And if it gets too crazy, we'll peace, I swear. - You swear? - I swear. - Pinkie swear? - Pinkie swear!

I do have to ask this. Is there any chance you were aware-- - Absolutely not. We were both at the office. If we'd known about the party, I would have shut it down. - Yeah, that's what I figured. I'm afraid that's all we have right now. - If you need anything else, please don't hesitate to call. - I'll be touch. - [Michelle] Thank you. - [Gina] Kelsey, a girl died and she didn't even have, have your-- - My what?

Hi. - What a dreadful day. - I know. - [Melissa] I just can't believe that she's gone. - I know. I'm sorry. - Everyone. I'd like to say something about Jessica. Jessica, wherever you are, you were such a bright light in all of our lives. Now we're thinking about you. And it's a radiance that we're really gonna miss here at Parish. Thanks, everyone. Your support means so much. - That was really nice. - Thanks. I'm having some people over after school. You should come. - I don't think I should. - It's a remembrance for Jessica.

I can own that, now let's move past it and talk about how we protect ourselves here.

Quite the young beauty, I see. - Thank you. I'd better be going. - Kelsey. You understand how it could look if people thought Mr Bloom and I were responsible for that party?

[knocking] Sorry, uh, is there anyone else in there? - No. - Seriously, are you in there? [dramatic music] Kelsey? Kelsey? Kelsey? [phone buzzing] - This is Gina. - [Detective Hopkins] Gina, thiss Detective Hopkins. Now listen, your daughter has been reported missing from the miniature golf-- - I'm on my way. - [Detective Hopkins] Gina! [dramatic music] [tires screeching] - Excuse me! Hi, hi, did you find her? - Not yet, Ma'am. - I don't know what happened. She told me she was gonna be right back, and then she just, disappeared. - Okay, hold on. Before we escalate the situation, Ma'am, it is possible your daughter just wasn't having a good time, and left on her own, no offense kid. - No, no, she was really excited about this. - Okay, how about things at home? - What? - Well, is there some reason why she might've wanted a little space? - Honor student, remember? Dean's list. - What the hell. - Ma'am, I-- Wait here. Ma'am. Gina, wait! [dramatic music] Mrs Jackson, please calm down, we have to take these things one step at a time. Your daughter's only been missing for two hours. - This is acetamezopine. My daughter's prescription for epilepsy. She would never leave this behind. - She's epileptic? - Yes. [tense music] It's me again, just please call me if you get this. [sobbing] [tense piano music] [tires screeching] [ominous music] - Gina? - Toni. Hi. - How are you holding up? - I'm okay. Toni, can you think of anything that might help explain what or where Kelsey may have gone? - Kelsey and I aren't really-- - No, I know you're not really talking, but you're her best friend. Please, is there anything you can think of? - Uh, well I did hear a rumor that Kelsey and Melissa got into a fight. - Where can I find her? - Um, just there, that room down there. Second. - That one? - Yeah, on your left. - Thank you. - Yeah, of course. - I knew she was a psycho. She's on all kinds of pills, mostly anti-psychotics. Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if she OD'd somewhere, and they just didn't find the body. [laughs] - Melissa? Excuse me, Melissa? Can I talk to you outside? - I don't think so. - Okay, um, as you know, my daughter Kelsey went missing yesterday. And I was just wondering if-- - Freak. - I'm sorry, what? - Kids with mental illness really shouldn't be allowed at school with the rest of us. You know school shootings? I already feel safer without her here. [tense music] - What the hell is wrong with you?! How could you say something like that?! - What is going on in here? - Mental illness. Runs in the family. [laughs] [muffled cries] [ominous music] [screaming] - Detective Hopkins, thank you for calling. What are you doin'? - I can't just sit at home knowing Kelsey is out there, okay? I just, I can't. - Well, that doesn't exactly explain why you attacked a teenager. - I hardly even touched her. I was stupid. I'm sorry. It's just that girl got into a fight with Kelsey and I just thought, maybe. - Kids fight. I know Melissa. I know her folks, they're good people, I'll talk to them. I'll make sure they don't press charges. - Thank you. - I know how scary this is for you. - Detective Hopkins? - Mike. - Mike. Have you ever held someone while they convulse so hard, they can bite their own tongue off? Wipe the bile out of their throats so they don't choke on their own vomit? Watch their eyes roll back into their head, like a God-- [sniffs] Well, that's what's gonna happen to Kelsey if we don't find her in the next 48 hours. - All right. We usually have to wait three days, but considering the circumstances, I'll put out the amber alert right away. [tense music] [sobbing] [dramatic music] - Why are you doing this? Please. Wait, please, wait, wait. Wait, I have a condition. I have to get to my meds. I ha-- You have to let me go, please! Please, wait, please. [intense music] [sobbing] [exhales] - Thank you, for getting that out. - Look, Mrs Jackson. We're taking this very seriously. I have guys pulling CCTV footage right now. We just put a tracker out on Kelsey's phone. We're gonna find her, Mrs Jackson. Kelsey's Father's aware of her disappearance, right? - I haven't seen him in a decade. - Well, is there any chance that's where Kelsey is? - She wouldn't even know how to find him. - Well, I wouldn't be too sure about that. Kids are resourceful nowadays. - My ex and I, we uh, left things really badly. - Why don't you talk to him? Find out if she's there, and if not, he should be aware of what's going on. - Yeah. Thank you. [tense music] Damon. Where's Kelsey? I know you know where she is. - How'd you find me? I called your old divorce lawyer. - You shouldn't have done that. - When you hear what I have to say, you'll understand. - Come on in, it's not a great neighborhood. I know, it's not much. - Hey! - Before you say anything, I need to explain. I did a lot of bad things when we were together. I accept that now. I wasn't fit to be a Father. Or a husband. - Damon, I didn't come-- - No, you just needed to hear me, just so you understand. [banging] - Hey! - You were right. I was nowhere ready to be a Father. Especially with a girl like Kelsey who had such a, such special needs. - She had a seizure and you were too drunk to drive her to the hospital. - I know, I think about it almost every day. - Hey! - But I've been sober 18 months. I got the chips and everything. - Oh, well that's good for you, Damon. - Gina, I haven't seen my family in over 12 years. I just couldn't take it anymore, I mean, you can understand that, right? Gina! - [Gina] Don't move. - What are you doing? - I said don't move! - Hey! - [Detective Hopkins] Gina? - It's him. It's Damon, he did it. You need to get here right now! - [Detective Hopkins] Tracking your cell. [dramatic music] - Gina, please. - Open that. - Gina-- - I said open it! Kelsey? Walk down. Move! Faster! - [Damon] Okay, okay. - Open it! Move! Kelsey? Faster! Kelsey?! Kelsey? [dramatic music] Kelsey! - Please! Help! Please don't! Please! Please! I'm epileptic! I just need my medication! Mrs Bloom! Please, I swear, I swear if you let me go, I promise, I'll never tell a soul. I just, I just need my medication. - How'd you know? - Your perfume. - Smart girl. - He was at the miniature golf course, we have video footage of his car arriving right after your daughter, but then he leaves again a few minutes later, alone. - I just wanted to see her. - What were you thinking? - I haven't seen my baby girl in so long. So I found you guys. I took a few photos, you know, just so I could have something of her around here. Then I saw what an amazing person she'd become. I just wanted to meet her. Just wanted to tell her how sorry I was that I wasn't there for her, for you. - Look, the uh, permit on the gun checks out, there's no sign Kelsey was here, it's not him. - Of course not. I would never hurt her. - Well, sir, when you were following your daughter, did you notice anything suspicious, anyone out of the ordinary? - Is that when she? - Yes, she disappeared a few minutes after you. - No. - Nothing at all? - I didn't see anything. I'm worthless, always have been. - Okay, I think we're done here. Get up. Due to your mental state, I think I'm gonna hang onto your gun for 48 hours. You can pick it up at the Sheriff's office in Parish. [ominous music] - Thank you, for keeping the gun. We have a rough history, but I wouldn't want him hurting himself. - Gina, I told you I would contact Damon. Now you have to go home. - But-- - Look, it was a mistake sending you here, I cannot have you doing any more cowboy stuff, you're gonna get hurt, you're gonna hurt somebody else. - But time is running out. - Yes, it is. Which is why I have to focus on doing my job, not cleaning up after your mess. Now please, go home. I'll be in touch. - Mel? A minute please? - Am I in trouble? - I don't know. Have you been following the rules? - Of course, Daddy. - [Michelle] Melissa, your friend Kelsey-- - I told you, she's not my friend. - Did she ever talk to you about being sick, or anything like that? - She's an epileptic. Like, full seizures and everything. - [Ryan] You should have told us before. - Sorry. - That's all. You can go. Melissa? Remember, no friends over for the next few days, okay? [tense music] [suspenseful music] - Toni. - Nothing? - [Gina] No. - [Toni] Can I stay over tonight? - [Gina] Of course. That would be nice. [sniffs] - This is a big screw up. - We shouldn't have rushed this one. After what happened to Jessica, I mean, we did everything, just like the first time. Had the party, fed her the drinks all day, we teed the whole thing up perfectly. - Stop! All I did was grab her arm, and she flew at me. The next thing I knew, she was on the ground. I had hit her and she'd flown back and hit her head so hard. That was it. I'm telling you, I didn't even hit her that hard. - I know. Baby, I know. You did what you had to do. Like always. [solemn music] [intense suspenseful music] [screaming] [grunting] [dramatic music] - [Gina] Toni, are you okay? - [Toni] Yeah. - Wait! Wait! Come back! [dramatic music] Toni, are you okay? [heavy breathing] He was about six foot, black jeans, black jacket, brownish hair. I never really saw his face, but he looked Caucasian. - Okay. - And I scratched him. - You scratched him, where? - Like here. It would have left a mark. - Frank? - [Frank] Yeah. - Get this out, right now. - [Frank] You got it. - What is going on? - I don't know. But we're gonna find her. This is what he was after. - Her medicine? - Yeah. If he was trying to steal these, it means she's still alive. Someone has her, and I'm gonna get her back. [gentle piano music] - Well that didn't go well. - You're gonna have to stay inside for a while. Does that feel better? - We should get rid of her. Start over. - None of Mel's other friends fit the profile. We don't have time to find a replacement. The girl's sick, Ryan. She's not cut out for this. - Since when do you care? - I don't, but if we sell a girl who dies before she gets to Europe, you know what's gonna happen. - All right. What then? You wanna let her go? - She saw my face. We could go. - [Ryan] Leave all this? - Hey, it's gonna be okay. - I know. - Okay. - All right, bye. - Bye. [gentle piano music] Hey. - Um, what do you want? - Well, I thought you could use someone to talk to. I promise not to attack you this time. Don't worry, I'm not that bad. Okay? - Okay. Have you ever felt like, cursed? - My only daughter is missing. Try me. - I used to live in Kirkwood. Back then, I had two best friends, Leslie and Alexa. We were inseparable. Leslie disappeared. People say she got lost, or kidnapped. I don't know, she never came back. There was just Alexa and me after that. But I guess the friendship wasn't the same, 'cause, she ran away about three months later. She never came back either. We moved to Parish after that. I thought it would be different here, but... I guess that's why I can be such a bitch sometimes. [sniffs] I can't hold onto anyone. - You'll be okay. It's all right. [tense piano music] [ominous music] - We haven't seen Leslie in six days. So, I'm asking, I'm begging, if anyone knows anything about our little girl, please, please call the police. [knocking] - Mike? What are you doing here? - How long since you've eate - Since yesterday, I guess. Please, come in. I'm glad you're here actually because I spoke with Melissa Bloom today. - Mm-hmm. - And I think I'm on to something. - Really? - Look. - Okay, yeah, I know this girl, Leslie Robinson, the whole state was looking for her. - Yeah, she was best friends with Melissa. And then another one of Melissa's friends disappeared a couple months later. - Well, this says that she ran away, right. - She emailed her parents that she was running away to Hollywood. - An email? - Yeah. Anyone can send an email, right? - Mm. - Two other girls. Just like Kelsey, they even look similar, all connected to Melissa. - Well, that is convenient. - If those girls were taken by the same person, then maybe-- - Then maybe I should speak to the Blooms. This is good work. - Thank you. It's just, with every minute that passes, I feel like I'm losing hope. - Hey, hey, don't lose hope. Just eat something, all right? - So, you'll uh, you'll contact me? - Eat. - Can I sit? I thought maybe we could start over. [dramatic music] [knocking] - Detective. - [Detective Hopkins] Ms Bloom. - How can I help you? - Uh, actually I was hoping to speak to Melissa, is she home? - She should be back shortly. Why don't you come inside? - Okay. [tense music] - Is this about Jessica, I thought Ryan cleared all that up. - [Detective Hopkins] No, this is actually-- - Hey! Help! - Coffee? - Sure, that'd be nice. [suspenseful music] So, uh, how's work been? - Oh, you know the import-export business. It keeps us on our toes. [banging] [tense music] Here you go. [tense music] So, what is it you exactly need to talk to Melissa about? - Oh, it's nothing major. Just a couple things we have to cover. Drop it, on the floor now! [dramatic music] I ought to kill you right now. - I'm sorry man. I thought you were gonna kill us. - I should. How can you be so stupid? - [Ryan] We didn't know she was sick when we took her. - I am working day and night to keep this girl's Mom from turning us into a nationwide scandal. So you break into her house and you get caught doing it! - What was I supposed to do?! The boat leaves tomorrow. If the girl dies before she gets there, it's all our asses. - You should spend a little less time worrying about them, and a little more time worrying about me. - You take her then. You can have our cut too. - Michelle. - That's not how this works. And if you wanna renegotiate, you'd better be holding more than a stun gun. - Sorry, Mike. We're sorry, okay? What do you want us to do? - That should keep her breathing 'til she gets overseas. After that, she's somebody else's problem. And we have another problem. Your daughter's been talking. - What? - Apparently she gave Ms Jackson a sob story about how all of her prettiest friends go missing. Do I have to solve that problem too? - No. It won't happen again. - You know, you guys should remember that if it wasn't for me, you'd be back in the trailer park, where I found you. [tense music] [heavy breathing] - We haven't seen Leslie in six days. So, I'm asking, I'm begging, if anyone knows anything about our little girl. - Eat. I can't have you looking sick. Here. - Thank you. - Now, eat. I won't ask you again. - Please, please call the police. We haven't seen Leslie in six days. So I'm a-- - Where are you sending me? - You know what's happening to you? - Human trafficking. - First, you'll go to Tripoli. Then on to Riyadh. It'll be tougher for you than the other girls, 'cause you're smart. It'll be easier if you just give in. Try not to think about it too much. There's nothing you can do. - Is that what you do? You try not to think about the girls that you're selling? Or what they're gonna do to me? [tense music] Come on. - She take the pills? - Yeah. - [Melissa] Hey guys, I'm home. - Want me to do it? - No. It should be me. [tense music] [knocking] Hi, honey. - Hi, Mommy. - How was your day? - You know, same old stuff. - Do you remember our old house? - Yeah. - This is much nicer, huh? - Yeah, it is. - It's fun to have nice clothes, isn't it? Fancy cars, fun parties. You know everything we have, it's because we followed the rules. We do exactly what Mommy and Daddy tell us to do, right? - Of course. - We never ask any questions, and we never, ever, talk about our old lives, do we? - Mommy, please. - Do I need to teach you these lessons again? - No, Mommy, I understand. - Are you sure? - I'm sure. I understand, I promise. Mommy. [tense music] [dramatic music] [footsteps approaching] [school bell rings] - Toni. - Hey. - Hey, did you hear any news, or an update? - No, nothing new. - Mel wasn't at school today. - Really? - Yeah, she just disappeared. - Oh, okay. - [Jason] Well text me if you hear anything, okay? - Yeah, I will. - All right. - Okay, bye. So weird. [phone buzzing] - Toni? - Hey, Gina. I just, I didn't know who else to call. - What's wrong? - Well, Melissa didn't show up to school today. Maybe it's nothing, just with Kelsey and everything, I just thought-- - No, no it's good you called. I'll look into it right away. - Okay. - Thank you, honey. - Bye. [gentle piano music] - Well, I see we found our appetite. - I thought about what you said. You're right. I'm gonna need my strength. 'Cause I'm not giving up. So whoever you're gonna sell me to, they better be ready for a fight. - Good for you. [doorbell rings] - [Gina] Hello? [knocking] [doorbell rings] [doorbell rings] [knocking] - Coming. Gina. - Hi. - I'm so sorry, I should have reached out earlier. I can't imagine what you've been going through. Especially as a single Mother. You must be devastated. - Thank you. I'm actually here about Melissa. - Oh, what do you need Melissa for? - Yeah, I heard she wasn't at school today, and I just wanted to make sure everything's okay. - No, it's fine. She's just sick. - Oh, thank God. Just when I heard, I... I've just been so anxious lately. - I can only imagine. - Did Detective Hopkins come speak with you? - I told him everything I could remember. I'm sorry I wasn't more helpful. - Would you mind if I talk with Melissa a little bit more about what happened? - You know, maybe in a few days, when she's feeling a bit better. You'll be in our prayers. I'm sorry. [door slams shut] [tense music] - What do you think? - I feel sick. - Do you think she knows? - Knows anything about our little girl, please, please ca-- [camera clicks] [tense music] [phone ringing] - This is Hopkins. - [Gina] Hi, it's Gina. - Hey Gina. Everything all right? - Uh, I just, I wanted to know if you spoke to the Blooms? - I sure did, I had 'em down to the station this morning. We had a thorough conversation about those other girls, and uh, I'm sorry to say this, but uh, it looks like a dead end. - Uh-huh. - Yeah, I'll give you a call if anything new comes up, all right? - Well thank you for looking into it. - Sure. - [Gina] Okay. [tense music] - Hey, it's me. [tense music] - Looking for this? - Please help me. - I always wondered why my Mom kept this door locked. But we never ask questions. It's rule number one. And if we followed the rules, we get to keep all our nice things. That's why we do exactly what Mommy says. - You're not like her. [suspenseful music] - Ms Jackson? - Hi. - We usually take these down after 12 months. But, uh, those two, just can't bring myself to it, I guess. This way. - Thank you for seeing me. - It's a travesty, what you're going through. How can I help? - Uh, well, I think there might be a connection between your missing cases and my daughter. - Okay. - All three were friends with Melissa Bloom. - Oh, I know where you're going with that. But we ran that trap. We didn't come back with anything. - Are you sure? - After the second girl went missing, we looked hard at the Blooms. In the interviews, financial profiles, searched their vehicles, turned their double wide inside out. - They lived in a trailer? - Mm-hmm. But we came back empty handed. Me and my deputies, we just couldn't believe it. - Was one of your deputies Detective Mike Hopkins? - He was the lead on those cases. He took it especially hard when we didn't come back with anything. Transferred only a couple months after that. - I need to tell you something, and if I'm right, you might be able to take those posters off your wall. [tense music] [phone buzzing] - Hello? - [Detective Hopkins] It's detective Hopkins, you at home? - Yes, of course. However I can help. - [Detective Hopkins] You be at Gina's right away. - I'll be there as soon as I can. [tense music] - Just got off the phone with the state AG. This is gonna require Internal Affairs. - How soon can we start? - Well, the IA investigators will be in Paris first thing tomorrow. I've already put in a request to take over your case. - Thank you. - Sit tight, Ms Jackson. I'll get with you tomorrow with the IA-- - But my daughter, she's still out there. - Yeah, I understand that, but trust me, we're gonna do everything that we can to find your daughter. - Thank you. - You're welcome. [tense music] [knocking] - Honey. Dinner's in five minutes. - I'll be right down. - In a week or two, maybe we can throw another pool party. - Yes, Mommy. I love you. - [Michelle] I love you too, sweetheart. [tense music] [footsteps approaching] - How is she? - She'll be fine. I don't trust him. - Me neither. - We have a little cash. We could still run. - It was my mess. I mean, it's my mess. I have to clean it up. I will be back in a few hours. I'll drive her to the docks, and be done with this. - I'll have her ready. - I love you. [tense music] - I hope I'm not too late. - Oh, Damon. - I came as fast as I could. Detective Hopkins said it was an emergency. - Wait, Mike called you? - Shut up. Move to the door. [dramatic music] Open it. Open up the door! Over there, now. - I know who you are. You're Melissa's Father, Ryan Bloom and you have my daughter. [tense music] - Over there, now. - He has my gun, Gina. - This isn't gonna work. I already talked to the detective in Kirkwood. He knows Mike and you were working together. Killing us won't make a difference. [dramatic music] - You're lying. - Think about Melissa. If you do this, you're gonna get locked up for life, and you'll never see her again. - Shut up! - I'm sorry. For everything. - Damon, no! [gun shot] [dramatic music] [grunting] [gun shot] - Damon, oh, I'm gonna call for help. - Go, get her. [dramatic music] - Sir, there's been a shooting. - Really? - Yes sir. At Gina Jackson's house. - What happened? - Gina, she shot Ryan Bloom. Apparently, Ryan shot Gina's ex-husband before she shot him. There's an ambulance on the way. Should I go to notify Mrs Bloom? - No. Uh, no I'll do that myself. Get everyone down to the crime scene. - Yes sir. [tense music] - No, no, no, no, no, no! No, wait, stop, wake up! Come on, wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! [screaming] [screaming] [dramatic music] [heavy breathing] - Kelsey, you all right? Are you all right? - Let go of me! - He's not gonna help you, go upstairs! Go now! [intense dramatic music] - Mom. - Kelsey! Oh my God, Kelsey! - I'm at Melissa's house. - [Gina] I'm already heading your way, just stay put. - I'm in her bedroom. - [Gina] Okay, just stay hidden. [dramatic music] - Melissa? - I don't want nice things anymore! - [Michelle] I'm so sorry. - Where is she? - Don't! - Where is she? - No! [choking] - Where's your friend? - I don't have any friends. - [Detective Hopkins] Where is your friend? - I don't have any friends. - Fine. You two wait here. [sobbing] Kelsey! Kelsey. - Mom, please be careful. - Kelsey, where are you? [dramatic music] Come on. Kelsey. Come on Kelsey, you're being ridiculous. [dramatic music] I'm not gonna hurt ya. [music intensifies] - [Michelle] No, please, don't. I just wanted to protect my daughter. - She's upstairs. [screaming] - Come here! [screaming] Come on! - No, get off me! [screaming] - Stop! - Gina. Oh, I don't know Gina, you seem pretty shaky with that gun. You got a lot of firearms experience? - Good enough for the last guy who messed with me. - Yeah, but you can't afford to miss this time. Drop it. Drop it. Drop it. - Okay, okay! You're right. You're right. Let her go. Take me instead. - No, no, Mom, Mom! Why did you do that?! - It's okay, it's okay. Wherever you're selling her, take me instead, I'll go willingly. - No deal. - If you want her, you're gonna have to go through me. - Fair enough. [screams] [shouts] [grunts] - You shouldn't have messed with my family. [grunting] Come on, come on! Come on! - Hand behind your head. - Gina, are you all right? - We're okay, but you better get paramedics up there fast. - Medic! Make sure the medics check the girl first. - Okay, let's go over here and get you checked. - Okay. - Turn. Watch your head. - Okay. [sirens blaring] [labored breathing] - Mike Hopkins. You're under arrest. [gentle piano music] - Are you okay? - I'm sorry. ♪ Whoa gotta get to you now ♪ Need you somehow ♪ Some way ♪ Whoa you remind me of heaven ♪ I need you right now [laughing and chatting] - Everything okay in here? - Yeah, we're fine, we're just doing some pivotal research. - Yeah, it's really, really important. - Oh, is that right? - So far, Cal Poly's in the lead. - Oh yeah. - Uh, did you remember the onne sign up for the tour at Berkeley, I heard you can't just-- - Mom, it's just college, we got this. - All right, just be ready in 10.
