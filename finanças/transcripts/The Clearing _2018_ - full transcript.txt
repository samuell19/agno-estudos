(birds cawing and chirping) (tense music) (Tom sighing) (rain pattering) (tense music) - Mira. Mira, you here? Mira! Mira! Hey, where you at, girl? Hey, Mira! Come on, it's not funny. Hey. Hey, 'scuse me. Have you seen a little girl? Hey, excuse me. - Run! (suspenseful music) (woman screaming) (Tom grunts) (woman groaning) (men grunting) - Daddy! - Mira? Mira! - Daddy! - Mira, run! Run! I'll come for you! - Daddy! - Run! Run! (woman shouting) (motor humming) - Oh, I like that one. - Oh, that one is a courage badge. We had to let other girls lead us blindfolded through this obstacle course, we had to climb through tunnels, jump over hurdles, very scary. But now we just need my cookie CEO and my naturalist to make brownie. - Oh, naturalist. What's that? - We have to pick flowers. - Come on, that's not a real thing, is it? - Tom. - Are we paying for this? What? - Yes, they're real. - Well, I don't know what you're doing, but when I was in scouts, I did real stuff, like you know, build fires, morse code, not this puppy cuddling or whatever. - Girl Scouts don't do all that stupid stuff. - Listen, that is not stupid, sport, it's the real stuff. - You know, picking flowers, that seems kinda stupid, right? - Tom, cut it out! - What? - It is stupid and nobody cares about those kinds of badges anymore. - No, they don't? All right, so a bear comes at you in the woods, what you gonna do? You gonna bake it a cake? - That's not gonna happen 'cause I'm not gonna go into the woods. - Yeah, well, I hate to break it to you, sport, but if you don't go in the woods, you are not a scout. - I am a scout, and you don't know shit! - Hey! Hey, Mira, come back here, don't use that language! - Hey, hey. - You believe that? - No, what the hell? - Me? - Yes, you! - I'm just trying to help her. - [Naomi] You're not. - Oh, don't be like that, come on. Oh, come on. She asleep? I'm sorry about before, I just... I didn't mean to upset her, it's just anything I say seems, just hates it. - She's just going through some changes. She's sensitive. - So I need to walk on eggshells now? - No. You just need to spend more time with her. - Fine, I'll take her to the movies on Friday. Easy. - No, Tom, real time. How about you take her camping this weekend? - This weekend? This weekend's not great. - What? - You know, busy. All right, so Dan might have like a poker night that I promised I'd go to. - (laughs) No, no, screw Dan. He can survive one night without you. You need to spend time with your daughter. - I know, I know that, but I need time for me too, and this week has been ridiculous. - Tom, I'm serious. If you don't make time we her now, she's not gonna make time for you in the future. - Come on, don't say that, it's not fair. You can't say that. I am killing myself for this girl. For you, for all of us. We have enough money so she can get these stupid-- - Are you listening to yourself right now? I mean, come on. You need to do this. (Tom scoffs) - You're not gonna let this go, huh? - No. - All right, fine. Fine, I'll do it. I'll do it. - Good. - Aren't you happy now? - Yes. (Naomi laughs) - Thanks for the guilt trip. - Guilt trip, really? Okay. (gentle music) - [Tom] Mira! (Tom murmuring) Come on! (knocking on door) Let's do it! - [Man On Radio] Have reported a rash of violent attacks across the county to police and/or officials. We're working to the establish the cause of these unprecedented outbursts. The CDC... - Hey, what say we just put the technology away this weekend, huh? No screens. What do you say, sport? Just you and me. Mira. Mira. Hey, hey, give me that. I say put it away, you put it away, all right? Don't pretend I'm not talking to ya. You hear me? All right now, there you go, sport. Well, we are almost set up. Thanks for the help. So, tell me what you wanna do today, huh? You wanna go for a hike? What's that? Is that a yes or a no? - No, not really. - Not really. (chuckles) Why not? - Because I don't like it. - How do you know you don't like it until you try it? Fine, okay, all right. How about fishing? I know you like that. - (scoffs) Not anymore. - (clears throat) All right. Well, that's great. So tell me then, what do you like? - Well, I like computer games and Amazing World of Gumball. - Amazing World of what? - Gumball. - Okay, no gumballs out here, so, (chuckles). How about we go for a hike, then, huh? Good stuff. (Tom sighs) (people chattering) Okay, see some cool stuff today, sweetheart. Hey. Hey come on, enough of the phone already. Put it away. I'm serious. (Tom sighs) Put it inside and leave it there, okay? I don't wanna have to tell you again. Go on. (Mira sighs) - Please stop. - Come on, lazy bones. - I wanna stop. - All right, you see up here, you got, what are you doing, come on, I said let's go, sport, come on. All right, what's wrong? - Tired. - Uh-uh, we've been barely going an hour, you're not tired. - Yes I am. - Trying to teach you how to be a scout here, kiddo. - I am a scout! Just want Mommy. - Right, well, your mother's not here, so. - (sighs) I just wanna go home. - [Tom] Look, we just got here, so-- - I don't care, I wanna go home. - [Tom] We came all this way to spend a little time together, and-- - I don't wanna spend any stupid time together. - Why not? - Because I don't like you. - Hey hey, hey hey, that is not nice, miss, not a nice thing to say. - I don't care, just take me home. - Mira, come on, don't be like that. - Just take me home and you can go to Dan's. - Dan's, what are you talking about? - (sighs) You wanna go to Dan's. Mommy made you come here. - Hey, no, no, that is not true. Not true, I wanted to come, I did. - You're a liar. You're lying. You always said no lying. - I am not lying. - (sighs) Last summer at the drive-in movie, that guy lied about stealing our spot. Then you said to Mommy that liars are the lowest of the low. - I'm not talking about, hey, stop, kiddo, stop. Stop, sport, sport. - What? (Tom sighs) - All right, look, how about... Let's go back, and we'll get some food and sleep on it, and tell you what, in the morning, if you still hate it, all this, then I'll take you home. Deal? - Fine. (solemn music) - Think bears live in those? - Could be, in the winter. - Can we go up and see? - Sure. It's a little steep here, but... There might be a path further up. Come on. - Dad. - Mm-hmm? - [Mira] Look. - Bring it over here. What you got? Huh. You know what this is? I think this is an old Chinook arrowhead. - Really? They really used smoke signals to talk? - They did, yeah. You know, actually, when I was a scout, they taught me how to do it all. I could show ya if you want. - Maybe later. So, you really think that this is a real Chinook arrowhead? - This one? - Yeah, I think it might be. I think you got one there, sweetheart. Oh, you dig one hole here, and another one beside it, here. And then make a little tunnel between, see, like that, see? So a fire goes in the first one, and the other one acts as a bit of a chimney, so if it rains, you can have one and still keep warm. Wanna try digging a hole? - Okay. - Over here. Yep. - Like this? - Yep, you're right. Just get that out of the way, keep going. You're getting it. - Dad? - Mm-hmm. - I'm sorry. - Sorry, for what? - That you didn't get a boy. I know you really wanted one. I can try to be more like a boy if you want me to. - Why would you say that? - So you'd spend more time with me. - You guys hungry? We made extra. - Sure. You wanna go? - Sure. - [Mira] Thanks. Yep, sure, we'll be right over. (guitar strumming) (people murmuring) What you got there, sport? - [Mira] It's a bunch of baby turtles. - Yeah? That's probably a nest. You wanna let that alone. - [Mira] I am. Where's the mommy turtle? - Probably out getting dinner or something. Come on, I wanna show you something. Come on, sport. Hustle! Come on, scoot. Here you go. Let's see. Hey, you know what that is? - Mm-mm. - That is another language, it's called morse code. You know that, you can communicate with pretty much anyone in the world. See, it's kinda like the smoke signals that we did, except everybody knows it. - (sighs) Dad. - What? - Smoking again, I can smell you. - I only had a half, just, hey, don't tell your mother, okay? - Oh, like that's not so bad. Mom says that every time you smoke a cigarette, you lose six minutes of your life. You just had half a cigarette, which means that you lost three minutes of your life. - Okay, well. Okay, you win. Can't have that, can we? Hey, how about you try to see, huh? - Okay. Hey Dad. - Yeah, sport? - You think those baby turtles will be okay in the rain? - They'll be fine, they like the rain. - Dad? (thunder rumbling) I think I like Josh. - The boy you were playing with before? - Mm-hmm. But, I mean, I don't think he likes me. - Oh. (Tom chuckles) You know what? If he doesn't, he's not good enough for you. - Okay. So, are you sure about the turtles? - [Tom] Yes, I'm sure about the turtles. They like water. - No, like, are you really sure. - (chuckles) Yeah. (rain pattering) (thunder crashes) (Tom sighing) Jesus. Oh, shit. (Tom sighs) (zombies growling) Mira! Mira! (Tom grunting) (suspenseful music) (Tom shouting) (gun clicks) (gunshots banging) (dramatic music) (gun clicks) (zombie screaming) (Tom groaning) Fuck you! (engine stalling) Oh, Jesus. (screeching music) (engine stalling) (gunshot bangs) (Tom panting) (Tom groaning) (phone ringing) No. (phone ringing) (Tom shouts) (phone ringing) (insects chirping) - Hey, you know all those stars up there have different names? You know that? - Yeah. - You do? Do you see that one up there? Brightest one in the sky, you see that? - [Mira] Yeah. - That one's Polaris. He's the north star. If you find him, always gonna know where north is. Hey, see the ones opposite the mountains, that little cluster here? I think that's the Mira constellation, if I'm not mistaken. - Really? - Yeah, named after a little girl. - That one is the Big Dipper. - Oh is it, is that what it's called? - Yeah. - Oh, I apologize. How about up here? That's Cassiopeia, she's always in the west, so if she's in the west, he's in the north, hey, tell me which way is home? - I don't know. - Go between those two, northwest? You really wanna get home, you head over that way. Can you tell me which way it is to Grandpa Jack's house? - No. Grandpa Jack's mean. - Yeah, okay. He's hard, sure. I guess he always has been. He still loves you, though. He sometimes has a tough time in showing it. Hey, wanna do a few more names? (zombies screaming) (tense music) (Tom shouting) (zombies grunting and banging) (Tom shouts) It's about 40 miles. 50, 50 miles. 50 miles. Okay. (radio winding) (radio static buzzing) (man mumbling on radio) - [Man On Radio] Police and National Guard are closing borders. (man mumbling on radio) (dissonant music) (Tom groans) (zombies shouting and banging) (glass shattering) (zombies growling) (Tom grunting) (zombies shouting) (radio winding) (Tom coughing) - [Man On Radio] Anyone hear? Come in. Come in-- - Yes. Wait, wait. Hello, hello? Yes-- - Can anyone hear this? (radio static buzzing) - Hello? - [Man On Radio] Hello? Anyone hearing? - Hello. - [Man On Radio] Anyone? - You read me? - [Man On Radio] No. (zombies shouting) (eerie music) - Mira. Hey. Okay. Are you okay? S. C. A. R. Scared, scared. Scared. I know, I know, baby. Stay. S-T-A... No no, no, don't. Stay. Stay, stay, no, no. (zombie growling) No. Mira! Mira, run! Run, Mira! Run, Mira! (Mira screams) Run! Jesus. (suspenseful music) (Tom shouting) (Tom panting) (thunder rumbling) (Tom coughing) - [Mira] Josh. Josh! (zombie snarls) (Mira screams) (zombie panting) (suspenseful music) (Mira screaming) (Tom coughing) (thunder rumbling) - [Man On Radio] Come in, please. - Yes. - [Man On Radio] Can anyone hear? - I hear, I hear you. Do you read? (radio static buzzing) Do you copy? - [Man On Radio] Anyone hearing? - Need cops. And I'll send you my coordinates. (radio static buzzing) (keypad clicking) Do you copy? Do you copy? Dammit. - [Man On Radio] Anyone hear me? Station 14. (radio beeping) (zombies shouting and banging) (glass shatters) (suspenseful music) (Tom grunting) (zombie shouting) (Tom coughing) (zombies growling) (solemn music) (Tom coughing) (Tom sniffs) (rain pattering) (zombies growling) (suspenseful music) Hey! Hey! (vehicle crashing) Hey, no no no! No, over here, come here! Hey! (dramatic music) (glass shattering) - I left early for my patrol up the mountain, and by the time I got back, everyone had changed. I was just alone. On my own. So I started driving, and I found you. - Driving, you came past, did you see a girl? A little girl? She's about, you know, I got a photo. - I don't know, man, I passed a few people, but I just wanted to get out of there. - Did you see her? Did you see her? Her. - Very possible, I mean-- - Are you sure? Are you sure? - It's a definite maybe. - Was she wearing a jacket? Was she wearing a jacket? Was she wearing a jacket? You see this out here, you see that? Was she, that jacket, was she wearing that? - No, I don't think so, sorry mate. - No, that's great, that's great. She could be alive. Here, where'd she get? How far from here? - Okay, I'd say right about there, towards the mountain. - How did she get that far? Was she with somebody? - No, no. - We need to go get her. - Yeah, of course, of course, we will, she's your daughter. But we'll need a plan. Have you got any guns? A hunting rifle? - No, I tell you what, I got... I got this. It's just got one bullet. - Yeah, that's not good. Okay, what about food, how much we got? - A couple of days, tops. - All right, well first off, we need to get your truck started. - Won't work, tried it, it's dead. (man laughs) - Shit. Well, that just sucks. Because we're gonna need to find a way to get past these people. - We'll find a way out, let's do it. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, easy, easy. - You and me, come on! - Get serious, okay? That's not a good plan. No... We are gonna be no good to her if we're dead, okay? Okay, okay, okay. We need to eat first, build up our strength, okay? Build up our strength, and then we'll come up with a plan. Come up with a plan. Radio station is dead. On the TV set there, the cities are a mess. And then it all just stopped. And now it's all just wee! (zombies growling) - Do you have a family? - I had a girlfriend. (man mumbling) - Get back to talking about this plan. I wanna get back to my daughter. - Yeah. Absolutely. But... (mumbling) food stuff. Especially for when we find her. You know, we could be out there a long time. You know, I know of this supply cabin, but it's not close. - I mean, I got a bunch of food. It's just up in that tree over there. I can't get to it. - Okay. Let's go look. Well, we're kinda faced with the same problem, huh? You got any way to hook it? - I already tried that. - Well, maybe I could just toss you. You know, tie a rope around you and I toss you. - Yeah, no offense, but you don't look that strong. - I might surprise you. Look, it's just a thought. We'll figure it out. - Hey, hey, hey, where do you think you're going? My daughter, what about the plan? You said you were gonna help. - Okay, okay, all right, all right. But you know what, we gotta be smart about it, okay? Otherwise nobody's gonna find her. The sun's setting, it's gonna get dark soon, and it's too risky at night. So let's set off in the morning, we'll go find her. - Bullshit. Hey. My daughter is 10 years old and she is out there on her own. She needs help and you said that you were gonna help me. - Get your hands off me. - Listen pal, I saved your goddamn life, you owe me. - I don't owe you shit, okay?! So back off! (man panting) (man laughing) I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Just gotta raging headache and I'm super stressed. This is the worst day in our lives for both of us. We'll set out first thing in the morning, okay? I promise you. (zombies growling) (insects chirping) (tense music) (gun clicking) (suspenseful music) (man shouting) (man screaming) (both grunting) (zombies growling) (man panting) (man coughing) (both grunting) (handcuffs clicking) (man shouting) (feedback ringing) (solemn music) (zombies growling) (men grunting) - [Man] No! (man panting) (man shouting) (zombies growling) (flesh tearing) (solemn music) (insects chirping) (Tom gasps) (thunder rumbling) (Tom panting) Mira. Mira? Oh baby. (Tom whispering) No, not you. Not you. (both shouting) (glass shatters) (rain pattering) (wind whistling) (thunder rumbling) (zombies screaming) (dramatic music) (thunder rumbling) (zombies screaming and growling) (explosion booming) - Turtles in space, right? No, it's true, it's true. Two Russian turtles went around the moon. - No they didn't. - Yes they did. I swear to god, they did. They came back just fine. (chuckles) - Hmm. You think they got scared? - [Tom] The turtles? I don't know if turtles get scared like we do. - I wish I didn't get scared. - No, it's okay. It's all right to be scared. I mean, grownups get scared. You just have to, you know, face it head-on and do the best you can. Proud of you, sport. - You are? - Yeah. - I'm proud of you too, Dad. (thunder rumbling) (Tom coughing) (Tom grunting) (Tom coughing) (zombies shouting) (solemn music) (metal creaking) (insects chirping) (zombies shouting) (tense music) (gunshot bangs) (Tom grunting) (zombie shouting) (suspenseful music) (gunshot bangs) (alarm buzzing) (engine revs) - Yes! (tires squealing) Go, go! (glass shattering) (engine roaring) (truck crashing) (zombies shouting) (solemn music) (explosion booming) (insects chirping) (solemn music) Mira. - I missed you. - Missed you too. (suspenseful music)
