Waiting We would like to thank Op. Dr. Mucahit Atmanoglu... ...and the hospital staff for their help from SSK Istanbul hospital. My wife and my son... He's been with us for six months. He has been living and talking for six months... but he doesn't understand what's going on around him. - He doesn't know to love yet. - But he will learn. Isn't that a human being? - Of course, darling. - Human... Human... What a beautiful creature. But it's only personable when he was a kid. It gets retrogress as it grows. He would become individualist, and say lies. As time progress wrong and dirtiness surrounds... ...all around you. All goodies die one by one. Dying. Get killed. Are you tired? Well, obviously not. You're frustrated. A little. I'll tell you. You always say that we are one in our fight for life. I want to know what your problem is. You are right. I am sick! I am sick! I am sick! I am sick! - Nothing much in sight. - I am sick. Send me to the hospital, doctor. Send me to a hospital with full-fledged. Because I'll be hanged very soon... I know you think my treatment is unnecessary. Yeah. - My wife and my son. - Is that so? He is like a lion. You wait over there, I'll go get the paperwork done. - I saw you well. - We too. - You're fine too, Dad. - I'm so good now. - How is your situation? - Good, very good. Is your money enough to spend? We are really in good. I do translation at home after work. We don't have any problems. You're getting so tired. Don't think of us. Let's talk about something else. - It's done. We're going to the rearmost room. - Come on! - What do you want? - We brought a prisoner. Well, come in. Take these medications. Use a dozen, then come again. Are these medicines expensive, doctor? I don't know. You'll learn while buying cheap or expensive. What's wrong with you? I said, what's wrong with you? I am sick. We got that you're sick. What is your complaint? - Prison doctor has a report, Lady Doctor. - Let me see. - Why didn't you take his handcuffs out? - He's on death row, sir. It is none of my business. He's one of my patients. I don't want to see a patient with his arms tied. He's liability. We can't take his handcuffs out outside, sir. Anyway, get over here. Give me that report. Take off your top clothes. OK. Get dressed. Do you want me to write tranquillizer to you? I thought you'd several various tests and X-rays. Let's take an x-ray on Friday and get the blood and urine tests. - Come back in the morning before you eat. - Did you say Friday? What's his wrong? He has nothing. Go on. I'm coming on Friday. - We'll come here too on Friday. - On Friday, Dad! The clock is past midnight. Sleep. Sleep, blue boy. Sleep, my thought. We haven't lost the beautiful poem in us. Your eyes, the eyes which will see. Be the morning, and be dawn, how will you feel from your heart... How new steps will come to next. Sleep, blue boy. Sleep, my thought. The clock is past midnight. Sleep. How... how did you come here? Did you run away? Here I am. I don't know if I ran away. Maybe they released me. You're here now. I'm here now. Where's my son? I don't know. I don't know. He is not at home. - But he'll come anyway. - It's pity. What a pity. I wish I'd seen him while I was here. - Are you leaving? - I don't know. I don't know. - I wonder if I should leave? - Don't leave! Please don't go! You shouldn't leave. Don't ever go now. Mom, mom! Mummy! What's wrong with you, mom? Rain... Isn't it raining? No. - Did you come early? - Don't care when we got here. - We've seen you. - Go on. If we're done early, there'll be time for both of you to talk. - You're looking pale. - I'm fine. Under the your eyes have also darkness. I could not sleep at night. - I brought you a potato pastry. - Thanks. - Will they let us? - We'll ask. He said you'd talk when you were done. Then you'll eat, dad. I thought you'd miss it. - And how! - I'll open it immediately if you want. Can she open it? There were pastries in it. Potato pastry. - She can. - Let's go to X-ray. You are also pace up and down. Thing... In my cell, I... ...it's look like here. It's been eight months. If I wanted to open both arms... ...to stretch like this, I couldn't. The walls don't allow it. Longitudinal of cell... ...is two and a half, width is one and a half steps. Most of the time, I often walk from wall to other wall. Most of the time I close my eyes... ...and wish that walk from wall to other wall will never ends. I'm afraid that always ends in two and a half steps. Well... It's very difficult. Is it difficult? It's not that difficult. - You have a habit, too... - Look! You don't have anything. I got that when you first came. I asked for X-rays and tests, so you could come back here one more time. But I'm afraid there's nothing more I can do for you. I mean, again... ...never... - Unfortunately. - At least... One more time for cardiography or something... This is impossible. I'll be responsible. You're right. You will be responsible for. It's nice that you're sensitive about responsibility. It's okay. Well, what can I do? So it's not possible. You made me come here a second time... ...even though you understood it the first time I was here. Thanks. I am sorry. Mom, look. There's an empty bench in the corner. Okay, little one, we'll sit there when your father gets out. - Did something bad happen? - No. It isn't too bad. - What happened? - Let's go. Well... I thought we were gonna sit down and talk. No time for that. Well but... But pastries... - Wait, don't worry. - Are you leaving now? It looks that way. When's next time? - There is no more. - No more than that? - Not at all? - Never. - Never... - Never... - But why? - That's it. Don't cry son. This is what upset your father. He always said: "It doesn't be suitable to cry us." Don't you remember? Don't cry. Oh my God. Forgive us. - We couldn't manage not to cry. - Come on! OK. Take care of yourself. - Good bye. - Good bye. Speak! Say something! Speak! Speak! English translation: ismuta KG @2020 Timing and Turkish Subtitle: nht.ctn
