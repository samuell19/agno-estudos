He'll feel guilty for this for the rest of his days. First time out in the cold, right? And instead of being pals, you're fighting like a cat and a mouse. (male #3) 'They are a cat and a mouse, Puggsy.' Uh, true, Frankie, but they gotta learn to be pals or they ain't gonna make it out here. True, too? All too true, too. Frankie da flea's the name, I'm of French extraction. [chuckles] That just means before he met me he lived on a poodle. I've been on the streets two years now. My owners left me behind when they moved. The name is Puggsy. What's yours? - I'm Tom. - I'm Jerry. - You talked! - You talked! Oh, sure, I talk. What do you think I am, a dummy? You said it. I didn't. Aw, you little pipsqueak. I ought to.. Hey, how come you never spoke before? There's was nothing I wanted to say that I thought you'd understand. And there still isn't. Alright, that does it, you little.. Oh, boy, you get me angry! Uh-uh-uh! I told you before. You guys have gotta learn to be friends. Absotivilutely. Puggsy and me's been through thick and thin. And thin and thinner. You gotta fight to survive. It's a dog-eat-dog world. Uh, that is not my favorite expression, Frankie. Ooh, sorry. Puggsy's right, fellas.

[intense music] [footsteps] [instrumental music] [tin clattering] Whoa! Hold it! Hold it! - Who-who are you? - Nobody. Just us. He's Tom, and I'm Jerry. Oh, I thought you were somebody else. I thought you were following me. Heck, no. Well, then what are you doing out here? We're lost and we're looking for something to eat. Yeah. We're kind of hungry. Oh. Well, I've got cookies and an apple and.. [instrumental music] So your name's Robyn and you ran away from home. How did you know? Your name's on your locket. Oh, yes, it's Robyn Starling. I'm afraid I don't have a home anymore. I-I'm an orphan. My mother died when I was a baby. What about your father? What happened to him? My father was on an expedition, climbing a mountain, when the snow gave way in an a-ava.. - Avalanche? - Uh-huh. And he was the most wonderful father in the world. We had our own secret place, just for the two of us. - 'And..' - That's where you were going? Uh-huh. And to get away from my Aunt Figg. She's not really my aunt, just my guardian. But she's taken over the house, she moved me to the attic and gave my room to her dog Ferdinand. Ferdinand? Aunt Figg was always calling me orphan. She even stole my locket and threw it out the window. But I climbed out and found it, and, and.. - Kept on running. - As fast as I could. And I'm never going back. Oh, smart. Real smart, kid. You got a roof over your head, three sure meals a day a warm bed. Who'd wanna leave that? I hate to admit it, Robyn, but Tom's right. You never know what you're missing until you don't have it. You don't know Aunt Figg. She seems sweet but underneath she's mean real mean. Aw, come on. I'll bet she's frantic looking for you. Oh, sure, she's crying her eyes out for you right this minute. [crying] Oh, my poor little Robyn! Oh, find her, officer. Please! The poor child! [crying] There, there, Ms. Figg, we'll find the little girl. I promise you. I'll call for a status report right now. Oh, please, please! I-I-I don't know how I'll live without her. [sobbing] (Lickboot) 'You won't be able to live without her, Pristine.' Shut up, Lickboot, you boo-too. But it's true, Pristine, without Robyn daddy Starling's trust fund money will go bye-bye-bye. And you'll be out in the cold, cold, cold. And you with me, Lickboot. Now, stop talking. You're a lawyer. Scheme! Ha ha ha! You find this amusing, Ferdi, you fat freeloader? You're the one who let her get away. Oh, but I was just eating. I know you were eating. You're always eating. You want this cupcake? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ah! Whew! Fetch! chomp Just pray the police find her, Pristine, or we're doomed to return to the ranks of the peasantry. And you'd better hope this rumor that dashing daddy Starling may have survived the avalanche is just a rumor or we'll be worse than ordinary. We'll be-- - Don't say it! - Poor. - Penniless. - Bankrupt. No more money? We've got to have money.

They won't be any bother. Please? meow - Oh, brother! - Please? Under the circumstances, it might be a good idea, ma'am if you know what I mean. [grunting] That's just what I was thinking, officer. Of course you can keep them, darling. - I can? - See? She's not as bad as you thought. You'll stay, won't you? You'll have a real home again. Will I? You bet! Ah, him, too? - Of course, him, too. - Thanks, Robyn. Officer? You wouldn't be able to join us for a little celebration snack, would you? - Well, sure, I-- - I didn't think so. Too bad duty calls and all that. I understand. Mucho thanks and au revoir! Ferdi? Show our new guests to the kitchen and give them something special to eat. Special. Yeah! [laughs] slurp As for you, orphan, for running away, you're going to bed without dinner. And your bed is back in the attic, where orphans belong. [instrumental music] Now, that's what I call eats. [slurping] [grunts] [upbeat music] Huh? grrr clank [music continues] grrr [music continues] [laughing] grrr [music continues] [yowling] [crashing] (Aunt Figg) 'Oh, what's all the commotion in here?' - Hmm? - Well.. Your pets are certainly housebroken. 'They've been here five minutes and already' they've broken the house. We really don't have enough room for them, do we? I-I'm sure they won't do it again, Aunt Figg. - I promise. - No, they won't. I promise. There's a sweet man down the street. Dr. Applecheek. He absolutely adores animals. He has a houseful, all kinds, and he loves them.. ...to death. I'm sure I can talk him into taking them in. They'll have all the food they can eat companionship, shelter.. [chuckling] And you can go and visit them every day. Well...I don't know. I'll have to talk it over with them first. Oh? Oh! Oh! You-you do that. Well, your daddy's lawyer.. Oh, your late daddy's lawyer Mr. Lickboot is waiting for me. [suspenseful music] - Well? - She says it's a house. And I'm a house-cat kind of guy. Jerry? Where's Jerry? - Maybe Ferdi ate him. - Tom! Hey, don't look at me. What am I, my mouse's keeper? [sniffs] Okay, okay. I'll go look for him. Alive? He's alive? The telegram just came. Starling's lying in some godforsaken native shack on a mountainside in Tibet. Maybe every bone in his body is broken.. ...if we're lucky. But he's alive! Well, look on the bright side. There may be another avalanche. (Aunt Figg) 'And he may be eaten by the abominable snowthing too.' Who cares? (Lickboot) 'Well, his daughter Robyn for one' 'and our creditors for another.' The point is daddy Starling is still.. ...alive! Robyn must never know. [sizzling] I'll make sure she never knows. I'll lock her in her room. Now, that's a good idea. [dramatic music] Hold it! What's the big rush? Read this. Robyn's father is alive! "Daddy.." [mumbling] "Tibet?" [mumbling] Hey! She's not an orphan no more! Goodnight, sleep tight and don't let the spiders and monsters and scary things bite. [intense music] How nice. You fetched my telegram. You're both so helpful. I'll make sure Dr. Applecheek takes special care of you. Run! Oh, no, you don't. [chuckling] Got your mousy! [instrumental music] Well, here it is... your new home. [knocking] Ah! Dr. J. Sweetface Applecheek at your service, dear lady. Pristine Figg, doctor, Miss Pristine Figg. [chuckling] Naturally. [giggling] Huh? [chuckling] These are the two sweet strays my darling little ward brought home. And you don't have room for them so you brought them here to my pet sanctuary. Exactly. (Applecheek) 'Well, my loving home is a shelter' 'for all our lost and abandoned animal friends.' You're gonna love it here. Heh heh heh! Do we have a choice? Yeah.

So, I ain't perfect all the time. I've been telling you that for years. So how'd you two guys wind up in a fix like this? We met this little orphan girl. Her name's Robyn.

Can't you do something.. [chuckles] ...devious? I'm sure if you put your mind to it you can be really sleazy. [groaning] Why, thank you, Pristine, but suppose we get her back and the little brat tells daddy Starling why she ran away? Who's he gonna believe, an over-emotional, whining distraught little girl or me her warm, loving, concerned nanny? Now do something! I mean, lie, cheat, steal.. ...corrupt our government, do anything to get that money, you nerdy nitwit. Oh, well, that's easy. A reward. - A reward? - Yes. People will do anything for money. Oh, don't I know. So? So, we offer a reward for her. Someone will turn her in. Big reward, say, $1 million. But we don't have a million dollars. I know. That's why it's so sleazy. Huh? Oh? [gasps] Oh! [laughs] Oh, I love it when you talk like that. [instrumental music] This'll get her back. [chuckles] [instrumental music] [lightning crashing] (man on radio) 'Your daughter has run away' and no one knows where she is. What? My daughter's run away?

[laughs] [intense music] My fault? What do you mean, it's my fault? If you had done away with those two like I paid you to that brat wouldn't have run away again.

We wouldn't want anything to happen to Robyn Starling. [gasps] Wait! How did you know my name? Sorry, kid, got to keep you here till your aunt arrives to fetch you. But I thought you were nice man. But I am, my dear. But he'll be even nicer with a million smackeroos. Enjoy your ride, my dear. It's on the house. [music continues] Please! Oh, please let me down! Don't send me back to Aunt Figg. She hates me! Please don't send me back. Just relax! Look around! 'You're on top of the world!' Aah! Aah! [dramatic music] [yawning] The sun's over the yardarm which means naptime for the ol' captain. Awk! [whirring] [instrumental music] [sighs] Oh! My locket! Tom! Jerry! Shh! [snoring] [dramatic music] [Kiddie grunts] Aah! What the.. Pirates off the port bow! - All hands on deck! - Awk! Get that varmint! Don't let him get away! Oh, hurry! Oh, get him! Gotcha! [car approaches] [tires screeching] [music continues] [groans] Where's the girl? We wants to see the money, honey. Awk! Only after I see Robyn. You're too late, boys. Where's the little brat? She's safe and sound on the Ferris wheel. - There she is! - The million-dollar kid! - We're rich! - Stop them! Ooh! [grunting] Tom, it's moving! [music continues] [groans] [both screams] Uh-oh! Don't look now, but here comes the dragon lady. Robyn, come to your dear Aunt Figg, darling. Spread out and don't let the brat get by you. What'll we do? I'll get us out of here. Come on. [music continues] They're getting away! Push the red button! It's always the red one! I know it! I was just gonna push it. Tom, Jerry, hurry! [music continues] Lickboot, get the car. We'll head her off up the river. Aye! Move it, captain! Move it! We're in a race for the million! Not to worry. This old captain still knows a trick or two. Let me steer! Let me steer! Out of the way, birdbrain. I'm the captain here. [music continues] [instrumental music on ice-cream truck] You're too late, doc! [laughs] Hey, doc, doc, we're up here! Hey, doc, get us out of here! Sorry, boys! One good turn deserves another! [laughing] [dramatic music] [gasps] Oh, no! They're following us! But we're going as fast as we can. Here, Tom. Let me try. [bell rings] [music continues] We need more steam! [bell ringing] [music continues] Yipe! [blows air] toot toot [music continues] [chuckles] Aah! Aah! Whoo!

[engine revving] [screaming] Let go of the wheel, I tell you! I'm the captain! I'll do the steering! Whoa! You couldn't navigate your way around a tub! [music continues] [screaming] Aah! [all screaming] [grunts] [gasps] Well, that takes care of them. But what happened to Aunt Figg? Where's she? I don't know. Maybe we lost her. [instrumental music] Wait a minute. This place looks familiar. - What? - Yes! I know where we're at. We're going straight to Robyn's nest You know that special place I told you about. [groaning] [screams] [engine revs] Aha! Of course! Lickboot, what are you doing? - You're gonna lose them! - Don't worry. Now I know where they're going. We're taking a shortcut. You know where they're going? How do you know? Lawyers know everything. [instrumental music] [boat chugging] There it is! There's the cabin. 'Daddy built it just for me. We'd come up here every summer.' He taught me to swim, and sail, and fish. Daddy will know where to find me. Maybe he's here already. I'll bet he is. Daddy? Daddy...is dead. Aah! Tom, Jerry, help! [grunting] And if you know what's good for you you'll never run away again! Never. You're not taking me back! You'll never take me back! Oh, yes, we will. [Robyn screaming] Ow! Why, you little.. Aah! [dramatic music] You fools! Look what you've done! Lickboot, grab the girl, and let's get out of here. Robyn, the house is burning down. You must get out before it's too late. No! No! I won't go with you! You'll never take me back! Aah! Lickboot, let's get out before we all fry! - But the girl! - Forget her! We got to save ourselves! [music continues] tap tap tap [keys rattling] Give me those keys! Look what you've done! ruff ruff Whoa! [music continues] [grunting] [music continues] - Ha ha! - Oof! Aah! [groaning] [screaming] [music continues] [helicopter whirring] Look! The cabin's on fire! We may be too late. Daddy! Robyn, I'm coming! Hang on! [dramatic music] Robyn, take my hand! Hurry! Oh, daddy, I knew you'd come. You're safe now, Robyn. I'm here. Wait! No! We can't leave them! - Hey! Hey! - Come back! Come back! [crashing] - Aah! - Tom! Jerry! [music continues] Oh, daddy, they're gone. My best friends are gone. Don't cry, Robyn. We'll find them. [instrumental music] [gasps] Aw, Jerry. Jerry, where are you? Oh, don't leave me, little buddy. You just got to be here. Oh, what would I do without you? 'You were the best pal a guy could ever have.' Oh, please be alive. I promise you, um.. - Uh.. - All the cheese I can eat? Yeah, all the cheese you can eat, and, uh.. - And no more traps? - No more traps. - And no tricks? - No tricks. - That's a promise? - That's a.. Ooh, I'm gonna.. Why, you little.. Tom! Jerry! You're safe! [instrumental music] Robyn! [laughing] Robyn, I promise I'll never leave you again. Well, well, well. Listen to this, Frankie. "Heroes! Cat and mouse save billionaire heiress." [chuckles] Well, what did I tell you, Puggsy? Those two have done alright. Yeah, I guess they learned to be pals after all. Mm-hmh. Friends to the end.
