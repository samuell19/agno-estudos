- You'd think after all this time this would feel less like a hangover. Maybe she was drunker than I thought. I know how this looks. I know how you all think. But let's put it this way. There comes a point where survival becomes just another job. Sweat and elbow grease moves the world forward. In this and in all things, it's repetitive. It's necessary. And it's lonely. But the thing is, I know love exists. I felt it. That pure tunnel vision that only true love can give. I felt it first hand. But it was never my own. It was always for someone else. From someone else. Never mine. - Hi, I'm Emily Roberts. Hi, I'm Emily. - Then one night someone shows up and everything changes. They look into my eyes and I know they can see me. The real me. Love is finally just for me. You never forget something like that. - Emily. Where have you been? I've had the police looking for you, I was worried. - There's a method to all of this. While I am them, I live as them. Plain sight being the best camouflage. - Where you going? - Most people can't tell. Most. - Who are you calling? - The police, they told me to call as soon as you were back. - James I've only been gone for... - Three days. Emily, you have been gone for three days. And not even a text. - It hasn't been that long. James. - What are you doing? Stop that. - James. James stop. James. - I'm not proud of having to do this. Sometimes in an isolated moment, I almost forget. And then the rot comes and reality comes crashing back. Six hours give or take. That's all I've got. When I was younger, I didn't have to think about it this much. One body lasted years, I could almost pretend life was normal. It sped up over time. Something isn't right. She should have lasted longer than this. It's a hell of thing to have to make this choice. When I've got time to plan, I choose carefully. Make sure they won't be missed. When I don't have time, I tend to order in. - You can leave the... - Good morning I'm Detective Ransone. James was supposed to call when you got back. When did you return? - A few days ago. - Yeah, I was just swinging by to talk to James. He hasn't checked in with us for a while so. Is he home? - He's not. Is there something that I can help you with? Would you like a cup of coffee? Yes please, thank you. - Please have a seat. Make yourself comfortable. - I'll just get right down to it. Mind telling me where you were? - Cream and sugar? - Just black, thank you. It's good. - You'll have to excuse me. Because I'm still uncomfortable talking about this. I'm sorry to get everyone so worried. - Not at all. I'm sorry this had to happen. I'm just glad you're okay. So where did you go? - Hi, I'm Detective Freddie. Hi, I'm Detective Ransone. Detective Freddie Ransone. - Delivery! Hey. Uh, hey. What the fuck man? You gotta pay for that. Hey. Hey man. Your house is on fire! Dude your house is on fire. - Ransone copy. Answer if you're there, please confirm. - I've picked up some tricks over time. Painkillers and antibiotics slow the change. If I have to get out of body faster, I need to rot. So, I have to find coke. - Oh shit Freddie. Now you gone and give me a heart attack or something man. What do you want? Hey man, what the fuck? Yo, you have no right to search and seizure my ass. I thought we were friends. - Shh. - This is bullshit man. That ain't mine. I'm just holding it for someone. - Hey, hey cool it. - In the quiet moments, my thoughts always turn to her. - Max, hey it's good to see you boy. How's it doing old timer? ♪ Earthshaking to say the least ♪ ♪ In the witching hour I confront the beast ♪ ♪ Blood runs cold, a chill in the air ♪ ♪ Leaves the victim unaware ♪ Left my home - Whisky rocks and a um, gin and tonic. - For me? - Yeah. - Alright, how did you know I drink gin and tonic? - Psychic I guess. - Oh yeah. - Hmm-mm. - Alright. What am I thinking about right now? - You're thinking. "Oh great, "another asshole with the same tired pick up lines." - Well, you are good. Now what makes you more than just another asshole? - Well, nothing. But something tells me, you're gonna talk to me anyway. - Oh really, uh huh. And would you like to take a bet on that? - Yes I would. - Jen witness. - Look I'm game, I'm glad we met. - Show me your money pal. - Oh hey, we've gotta shake on it first. - Everything okay Julia? - Yeah I'm good, fine thanks. - She's in good hands okay. Cop, not a creep. - Cop, not a creep. Let me see this, is this real? - It is. I'm Freddie. - Julia. - But in the spirit of disclosure, everyone calls me Detective Ransone. - Oh Detective. - Yeah. - Well Detective, is this an interrogation? Am I in trouble? - No, no, I'm, I am off duty. But I am trained to notice the most interesting things in a room that others can overlook. - And is that why you came over here? To talk to me? Because I interest you? - She's the only one that matters. - Yeah. But um, take, take a look around. Do you see anybody else I ought to be talking too? - Ha. Yeah alright, I'll give you that one. You make a good point there. - It's the first of many. - Why are you in this crappy old bar? - Hey, it's, it's Christmas. - It is Christmas. - Yeah where else you supposed to go? - Really, what is? Okay, pinkies. - I can't bend this. - What? Dude that's so weird. Oh my. That's disgusting. - You okay? You alright? Oh shit. - Ooh. What? - Just, it's nothing. - Uh... - Run. - What? - Run. Run! Oh God. - My condition isn't without a few benefits. Injuries don't follow me to the next body. - What the fuck is happening to me? - Until now. - We're not doing anything Officer. - Go home. You, move over. - Please, just let me go alright. Whatever laws I've broken, I'll pay the fines. Whatever you need... Shut up! - Look look, this is not what it looks okay. I've got a wife and kids and they're expecting me. Jesus. - If I don't do this, I'll die. And I'm not ready to die. Which means, you'll have to. I'm sorry. People who live in a house like this, tend to stay there for a lifetime. Roots dug deep, fearing any change. Suffocating in comfort. It doesn't stop some perverse instinct in me from wanting this too. It's only nature I think. The pull of the pack. - Daddy, Daddy wake up. - Get the fuck off me. - Mummy, Mummy, Dad said a bad word! - After school can I go to Chris's house? - As long as you've done your homework in time. - Okay. - You know the rules. Sit, join the kids for breakfast. - Daddy, what's wrong? - Nothing, nothing sweetie. I can't stay, I'm gonna be late for work. - Bye Daddy. - Sam no, you're drunk. You're my boss and my friend, but nothing more. Oh good morning Dr. Richardson. - And how are you today? - I'm good. How are you? Everything okay? - Never better. - Okay then. Your first patients already waiting for you in room three. - Tim is it? I'm Dr. Richardson, how are you today Tim, huh? Let's make you nice and comfortable. You just relax. Don't you worry Tim. This isn't the first time I've been a dentist. All fixed. He may have some lingering pain for a few days, but soon enough he'll be right as rain. - Thank you. - I can only keep up their routine for so long, it drains the spirit. I need breaks. - Just drive. Follow that silver car. - I'm sorry where? - Follow the silver car already. - Oh you want me to follow that woman's car? Yeah I'm not gonna do that. It's suspicious as hell man. - Never mind. I've been trying to figure out her new address for almost a year. Movies have always been a big part of my life. Something about being in that dark room, is such a healing experience. It's get me out of head, helps quiet the voices. - Can you shut the fuck up? - Why do seagulls live near the sea? - 'Cause that's where they get fish? - No, 'cause if they live near the bay they'd be bagels. - That's a good one. - So bad. - Okay, you go ahead honey. - He turned into a monkey and then... - And then what? - It ate all the cookies in the world. - Oh my goodness. - I've really only got one tangible thing left from my true family. Only one constant. The rest is memory. - I saw you here last night right? You were with a younger girl I think. - Yeah. I don't know what I was thinking. - Oh, I take it that she wasn't your wife. - No, a momentary lapse of judgment I'd call it. Don't plan to make that mistake again. I was, getting away from my family. Sometimes I just need an escape, you know. - Where are you going? Sam! - Yeah, I used to think like that. But, I never really realized how wrong that was. - Huh? - You love them right? - Yeah, yes I love them. - Then make sure that you always go back to them. That is all that matters. I had a little boy and a husband. And I felt the same way that you do, more often than not. But now if I could go back I would spend all of the time that I could with them because it is fleeting. - What happened? - Hmm, no you don't wanna hear that story. It's not a happy one. - It's not a happy night. It's not even happy hour. - Well, my little boy, Taylor... He died. A few years ago. There was complications with pertussis, he was, that's whooping cough. He was only three. - I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - Yeah I've come to terms with it, the best that I can. Sorry. Anyway he passed away. And it was just Richard and I. That's my husband, and I. And... It was really fucking hard. It changed things. And this one night I came home and Richard had set up the table for dinner. And he'd lit these candles and made it romantic and he said that he wanted us to forget. Even if it was just for that one night. And so we did. We ate and we laughed. We made love. And it felt like it was the first time all over again. And then I woke up in the middle of the night and he was gone. He was just gone. There was no trace. It was like he just vanished. Oh. I think that it was all just too much for him and he had to leave. And I think that that night was his proper way of saying goodbye. - Can I, can I buy your next drink? - Yes. - Yeah. - Thanks. - Hmm. - So what about you? Why the need to escape? - I'm afraid. I'm afraid. I really don't know, what I'd, what I'd do if I stayed. Sometimes I um, I wonder if, what's best for them you know. - Do you consider yourself a good person? - I'm not even sure I'd consider myself a person. The real question is does being good really matter? I mean really matter. Bad things happen to good people all the time right? - Yeah. They do. But you know what I think that the important thing is to make sure that you are not the bad thing yourself. - The coke may serve a function, but it's still coke. It does what coke does. You take it when you wanna escape yourself. What? - Sam? It's really late, what's up? - I really need someone to talk too. I didn't know who else to call. - What's going on with you? Last night was bad enough, but you left the office today without a saying a word. We had to reschedule half a dozen appointments. Are you in some kind of trouble? - No, no, it's nothing like that. I had, I had a really bad night with Mary. And she kicked me out. - Oh Sam, I'm sorry to hear that. - Do you, can you come see me? I don't wanna be alone right now. - Jesus Sam, seriously? - I'm really sorry about last night. I, I made a mistake. I promise I won't try anything like that again. I just, I really need a friend right now. Please. - Alright. Tommy's already passed out here so I'll drive over. - You're still with him? - Yeah, you know that. Address? - Do you have a pen? It's unlocked. - Before I come in, I just wanna say I'm not super comfortable with this. We're friends and all but this is pretty fucking above and beyond. Coming to a motel in the middle of the night. You try anything and I am out the door, you got that? - Got it. - Also, I wanna talk about a raise. Why's the room so dark? Where the hell is light switch? - Come here Rachel. - Sam? Are you okay? Oh Sam, it looks like you've overdone it a bit yeah? Sam? - That hurt a lot more than usual. It feels like I'm dying. That's not gonna cut it. She probably has access to antibiotics. - Hi Tommy. - Where'd you go? It's the middle of the night. - I felt a migraine coming on. I ran out to all night pharmacy, be back soon okay. - Uh huh, can you pick me up some smokes? - I'm already on my way back, sorry. See you soon okay? - Is that you Frank? I haven't seen you around much these days. Been seeing the smoke though. What you burning? Something smells kind of weird. It's just Colleen. Is that your car parked out here? Hey. Hey, hello. Are you Frank's granddaughter? - Damn it. Tommy? - Lucky break, he's gone home. - Hi. Hey buddy, how's it going? Wait. - Whisky on the rocks. - Oh boy, someone is looking for trouble tonight? - It that obvious? - Well that dress and this bar, it, it really doesn't take a PHD. You look great but... - Thanks, just killing time. - Well, you've come to the right place because this is where time comes to die. - What brings you here tonight? - Um, I'm here most nights, right Jen. - Ah. - I can't, I can't get much writing done at home. The silence just drives me mad. - You a writer? - Um, wouldn't go that far but, I just, I like it and it helps me sort things out. - What are you working on? - A book. Yeah, I know. - That's impressive. How soon 'til it's finished? - I have absolutely no clue. It will be, it will be finished when it feels finished, you know. My... My therapist suggested that I write down my thoughts. To help me cope. And it just got way out of hand, I guess. Hey I'm Julia by the way. - Drew. - Very nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - Did I see you here the other night? I think with a, an older gentleman, sort of. - Oh. Yeah, you've got a good memory. - Yes I do, me and elephants. - Hmm. - No, it's just this place, it never seems to change, just the people do. So, I'm here a lot and I tend to notice the faces that stand out. - Yeah I like that about this place. - What's that? - There's a lot to be said for consistency when you don't have it anywhere else in your life. - Yes, yes A-fucking- men to that. Cheers. - Cheers. - Cheers. - Hmm, decades have passed and this place has stayed the same. I remember back in the 70's when... - Wait, hold on, I'm sorry. Did you, 70's? You're like 20. - Consider me an old soul then. - You know you have sad eyes? - What? - Hmm-mm, yeah you have sad eyes. I can tell you are not here for a good time tonight. I don't know what it is but, yeah you're not here for a good time. Hmm. You know what? Here. I am going to give you a card, here. The address to my office. Sorry, I'm a counselor. The address to my office is on there. And if you ever need anybody to talk to, about anything, after tonight, just give me a call okay? - Thank you. - Hmm-mm, she knows I'm not creepy or anything. - Can I buy you a drink? - Hmm, hello. - Um. - Yes, you can, yes you can. That is my queue to leave, I'm leaving. Please, you can have my seat. Hey, have some fun. - Alright. - Jen can I grab another please? Whoops. - So, drink? - Sure, whisky rocks. Thanks. - That's funny you ordered a whisky on the rocks, that was my old football coaches favorite drink. On the off season and the on. You like football? - No. - I loved it. Fucking varsity football, 2007. Am I boring you? - Not at all. - Okay so, as I was saying. Getting down there, the 15 yard line, boom, I get it sweep right. - What the fucks this asshole even talking about? What a douche bag. - Our 15 yard line and it's all. I flip inside, I fell. You know 15 yard line on their side. Big tackle. - Maybe he'll be some use after all. - I just need to run to the bathroom, be back in a minute.

Fucking bring it. - Can we slow down a bit? - You want this as much as I do. - Please. - Don't be such a fucking cock tease. - Get off of me! - Help, someone call the police. Don't worry, the police are on their way. I've just called them. Most of the cops in this city couldn't find a needle in a bucket of needles. You be enough of them, you realize it's best to just stay put. - Rachel, I know you're here! Rachel! - How did you know where I was? - A rule to keep me breathing. The boyfriend of a murder suspect is not an ideal form to take. His lucky day. - Rachel! Rachel! - I'm kidding myself if I keep this up. If I'm running out of time, I should face the facts.

I hope this doesn't sound too forward but, I can't stop thinking about you. Hello. - Yeah, yeah I'm, I'm here. And I'm flattered Robert. Really I am. - Okay just, give me one second here please. I like you. A lot. And I wanna see you again. Someplace where the two of us can just be alone. - Okay. - Okay? - Yeah okay. Your place or mine? - Let's make it your place. - So yeah, this is my place. I know it's kind of basic. I just, I don't know, I lost the taste for caring about design I guess. Um, I'm just gonna put on some music. You wanna do the honors with that? - Yeah sure. - Oh nicely done. - I used to be a server. In a past life. - Well color me impressed. Cheers. - What do we cheers to? I got it. To, possibilities. - All there ever is. - Cheers. - There's just something familiar about you. I don't know what it is but... - I think when two people have a connection like, a real connection. There's this, familiarity and there's this comfort that drives it. - Is that you think we have? A connection? - No, I think. I think we're kindred spirits you and I. - Oh. - Yeah. I heard it when I said it. - Uh huh. - That was terrible, I'm sorry. - Alright, and what would, what would two people such as ourselves want in this moment? - To connect. ♪ Pick me apart now ♪ Find someone else to blame ♪ Wallow in shame ♪ Until it's gone ♪ Time where have you gone now - Oh jeez. What happened? - I cut myself, it's okay. - On what? - I walked into a nail, I'm fine. - You walked into a nail? - I walked into a nail. - Are you okay? - I'm perfect. - It's burning. - It's kind of my thing. It's a bit of a delicacy. - Making breakfast? - Yeah, I hope you don't mind. I was kind of under the impression you don't get treated too often. I wanna change that. - You are very sweet. - I used to hate being alone at Christmas. Then I just hated being alone. Eventually I realized, at least as far as people go, quality is far better than quantity. Every time. I had a dog when I was kid. I loved him with all my heart. When he died my mother told me that was how things are. That everything ends. Nothing's permanent. As much as you want it to be. I didn't wanna believe it at the time but age showed me just how right she was. The moments are what matter. And they're fleeting. - More developments in the grizzly discovery of what is being called the Farm of Death. As the remains of dozens of victims have been recovered so far. As of yet, only six victims have been identified. While the search for previous person of interest Rachel Martin has been called off when investigators found her remains among the dead. The remains were discovered - Hey hey. - When local resident Pauline Baker - What are you doing? - Noticed suspicious activity. - Why are you watching this stuff? There's not enough bad in the world, you gotta watch these hacks sensationalize peoples tragedies? - It's just so close to here. - Yeah, but I mean when they put on TV like this. Then they, you know, they make it sound like it's a million mile away, like a movie or something. - No, not this time. I recognize some of those people that they've identified. I've spoken with them in the bar. - Okay well. Hey, you know what. I think I'd rather just concentrate on the here and now. That's what's important right? - Hmm-mm. Just so scary. - I won't let anything bad happen to you. I promise. - You think the traffic will be bad? - I don't know. This city's so small, it can't even handle the population it has now. - Okay, well I should be ready soon, I think we'll be fine. Are you okay in there? Robert? - I'm fine. I'm fine. I'll be out in a second. - Feeling okay? - Yeah. - Don't, don't, don't touch me. - Why? Are you okay? - Do you trust me? - Yes. Of course I do. - There's something I need to tell you. You should probably sit down, it's gonna make it easier. - What are you talking about? You're scaring me. - Alright please just, please can you do this for me? Can you just, go and sit down. - Well? Okay, what is it? - Okay. You're the only person I've ever told this too. When I was 12 years old, I was responsible for my mother's death. I was, I was young. I didn't know what it was at the time. But, I mean, it was an accident. - So you feel responsible? Hey, that was a long time ago. - Yeah. Yeah. It was 1954. - What? - I'm a lot older than I look. - You're not, wait you're not making any sense right now. - I know, I know. When, when I took her, my mother. I saw. No, that's not right. I felt. I remembered. I remembered the way she loved. This love that was just so pure. I never felt anything like that in my entire life and I never did again. Until, until a couple of years ago. Yeah um. I take people. That's what I am. It's... I become somebody else. There's this change that happens inside of me and if I don't find somebody in time, it'll kill me. I know it will. It will kill me. - What do you mean take? What do you take? - Everything. Their voice, their shape, their look, their memories. Their hopes and dreams, everything that makes somebody who they are, I take it. And I keep it, for good. They're all, all up here. - You are really not making any sense right now. Why are you saying all of this weird shit? - I know, I know, I know it sounds like weird shit, but it's the truth, I swear to God Julia, it's the truth. - I'm gonna go home. - Wait. - I really thought I'd finally found somebody normal. So thank you for this. - Okay wait, I haven't even told you the whole story yet. Please just wait. - I don't wanna hear it. - Okay, just wait. - Don't wanna hear it. I got my own shit to deal with, I can't deal with this. - I've known you a lot longer than you think okay. I loved you a lot longer than you know. Jesus Christ. The other night, the other night, that was the first time I ever told you my real name. I'm Drew. I'm Drew. It's me. - What the fuck are you saying? That... - Before I was Robert, I'd already met you a dozen times. - Hmm-mm. What the fuck do you mean "before you where Robert"? - I was just telling you. I get their memories. This is, they're all. This is how I fell in love with the first time. I saw you, I saw you and the love that Richard had for you. - Uh uh. No. - The second time, the second time that I felt that pure love was in the love that he felt for you. The love your husband felt for you. Hey, after that, after that I knew I needed to make you happy. I needed to make. - Oh God. - I needed to make everything okay. I needed to make it alright. - I don't know what this is right now? - That first time we made love, I felt such a connection to you. I played that Lou Reed song, you know the one? That Lour Reed song you love so much. It was perfect. Look, I know you feel it, I know you know it's me. I felt terrible that he had to leave you. That I had to leave you. - I never told you about Lou Reed. - I was there, it's me. I was there. - Do you know? Do you know something about Richard? Do you know where he is? Where is he? - He's at that farm. The one north of the city, the one on the news. - Who the fuck are you? - I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know who I am. I don't even know what I am. I, I tried to figure it out, years ago I tried to figure it out. There's these stories, there's these legends in the Native culture about Skinwalkers, people who take. Okay, okay, this doesn't matter right now. What matters is. Hey, hey, hey. What matters is you need to understand that this was never personal. None of this was personal. It was about my survival. It was about my survival. With every single person I took. - The ones you killed you mean. - No. You're not getting this, you're not getting this. Why aren't you getting this? Why aren't you getting this? Why won't you get this? - Robert. Robert. - Is there a way you can understand? - Drew. It's Drew right? I need you to let me leave right now, okay. I'm just gonna go. - No, no, baby. - I just wanna go. - Hey, I would never hurt you. Jeez Julia, I love you. I love you and they're not dead. Your husband's not dead. - Stop. - Jesus. - Right there. - Alright. - I fucking mean it. - Why don't, why don't you get it? - God! - It's okay. Julia, it's okay. It's okay, I love you. - No. - I love you... I'm here for you. - Are you fucking kidding me? Are you fucking kidding me?!? - You need to stand back because I can't control this once it starts and I don't wanna hurt you. - You know what, fuck you! - No, don't, don't! - I'm sorry. I didn't mean to hurt you. I just wanted to be close to you. - You doing okay Julia? - Hey Jen. I really appreciate you taking care of me these past few years. It really meant a lot. - I spent my entire life looking outside for answers. But I've always known deep down I'm the only one who can stop this. I'm not dead. Why am I not dead? - What the hell? - What am I? My mother once told me nothing lasts forever. Everything ends. I think maybe she wasn't entirely right. The choices we make leave echoes. The guilt we carry always lives on. You can blame your upbringing, the wrong ideas you had about just who you were and how the world worked. Blame how wrong you were about everything. You try to do better, but the guilt lives on. The tiny voice in the back of your mind. Starting as a whisper and building to a chorus. Growing until there's nothing left of who you once were. Until you can't remember who you're supposed to be. Or maybe there was never anything of you in the first place? Maybe you never really knew who you were. ♪ Low down rat ♪ Evil fly ♪ Circling shit a mile high ♪ You don't deserve a goddamn thing for Christmas ♪ ♪ Greedy slug ♪ Selfish prick ♪ Smiling wide ♪ Convinced you're slick ♪ You don't deserve a goddamn thing for Christmas ♪ ♪ Walking on the backs of the weak ♪ ♪ You're karma drives a dead end street ♪ ♪ It makes no difference to me ♪ I'll let it go ♪ I'll let it be ♪ Corporate shill ♪ Religious twit ♪ Such a blatant hypocrite ♪ You don't deserve a goddamn thing for Christmas ♪ ♪ Evolution forget that ♪ Climate change, your wallet's fat ♪ ♪ You don't deserve a goddamn thing for Christmas ♪
