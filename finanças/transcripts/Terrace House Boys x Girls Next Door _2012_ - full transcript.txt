Happy New Year. Tonight will be a special episode, and I'm bringing it to you right from the editing room. TERRACE HOUSE EDITING ROOM This is probably not your first time watching, but just to explain... Six boys and girls who didn't know each other began a life in a share house. Just to briefly introduce them, we have the pro-surfer Ma-kun, who ranks 36th in Japan. MASATO YUKAWA aka "Ma-kun" (20 YRS OLD) PRO SURFER | LAST RELATIONSHIP: 3 MTHS AGO I'm thinking of leaving this house. Why? I feel like I need to become more serious. -I need to get bigger. -Ma-kun's very serious. We then have our model Seina-chan, who's been appearing in runway shows. But then add a little alcohol and... SEINA SHIMABUKURO aka "Seina-san" (25 YRS OLD) MODEL | LAST RELATIONSHIP: 2½ YRS AGO she becomes a real wolf. -Ma-kun still has a ways to go. -Still a ways? Still a long, long ways to go. -He's still immature. -Immature, you say? Then there's the art student in a long-distance relationship, Sho-kun. SHOTA NAKATSUGAWA aka "Sho-kun" (25 YRS OLD) SENIOR AT TOKYO UNIVERSITY OF THE ARTS | LONG-D ♡ I'm a student at Tokyo University of the Arts. Then there's the aspiring writer, Momo-chan. MOMOKO TAKEUCHI aka "Momo-chan" (21 YRS OLD) ASPIRING WRITER | LAST RELATIONSHIP: 2½ YRS AGO I'm getting plastic surgery next month. Seriously? She does things like small plastic surgeries on her nose. Then there's... When I was in high school... TETSUYA SUGAYA aka "Tecchan" (19 YRS OLD) ASPIRING ACTOR | LAST RELATIONSHIP: 1 YR AGO I wanted to be an actor... He took the firefighting entrance exam but couldn't pass, but in reality, he says he wants to be an actor. This aspiring actor is Tecchan. And then... I'm Rie Kitahara, I'm 21. It's nice to meet you. RIE KITAHARA aka "Ricchan" (21 YRS OLD) AKB48 | FORBIDDEN TO DATE Rie-chan is currently involved in AKB48, the group that has captured everyone's hearts. These are our six people. The show has only prepared a nice house and a nice car. There's no telling what will happen. There's no script. So this is how the situation began three months ago. Tonight is a special episode, so I'd like to introduce to you a love that developed over the course of the show in this house. TAYLOR SWIFT (23 YRS OLD) SINGER-SONGWRITER She's so adorable! -Thank you very much. -Wow! PRESENTED BY COSTCO SUBS Translated by Alice (terracemouse) Corrected, Timed & Titled by Brian (goob) 1st WEEK: "THE LOVE THAT SPROUTED IN TERRACE HOUSE" Like if someone here... -started to like you Rie-san... -Rie-san? Ok, then, out of the three of us... What if you started to feel excited about one of us...? Hmm... well, in terms of AKB... it probably wouldn't be okay. So if it became like that... It'd be like, quit AKB? Yeah, I'd probably have to quit AKB. Hmm, but I'm not sure. If I half-heartedly do this, I feel like it'd be better not to do it in the first place. So I've come with the intention to participate full-heartedly. Amazing. We're all looking forward to this. It immediately started out fresh. It's still hard to say anything, but perhaps Tecchan has experienced something like love at first sight? From this point, Tecchan's love begins. 2nd WEEK: "ALONE WITH A NATIONAL IDOL..." Good morning. You seem really tired. Oh man, I'm so hungry. Ricchan, do you have any food you really love? -I like horse sashimi. -You like raw horse? -I've actually never had it. -No? -There's actually a lot of things I've never eaten. -Yeah, there's a lot! There's also so many things I've never done before. Yeah, it really makes me think what I've been doing these past 19 years. It's okay, you're still young, and that's what's important. I often think about how I feel I'm always eating the same things and doing the same things. So I want to try and challenge myself to a lot of new things. Yeah, you should try doing many things. Like I want to ride a shinkansen (bullet train). Yeah, I was surprised by that! I want to ride a shinkansen. -Yeah, you know you have to put these things on. -You're lying right? You're serious? -Like Gacchan? -Yeah, like Gacchan. Because it's so fast. So that's why you have to fasten yourself in. Wowww. Ricchan was funny. I also often tell lies like that. Like when I told my son... you know, those tall trash incineration plants with these large chimneys... Whenever we'd pass them, I'd say, "Don't bite! Those are good luck!" That's what I kept telling him as I raised him. Women surprisingly like to play around like that. Tecchan must be looking forward to riding a shinkansen. 3rd WEEK: "GOING SHOPPING, JUST THE TWO OF THEM..." GROCERIES: ONIONS, GROUND MEAT Ground meat... Tecchan, what sort of strategy are you thinking? Strategy? I'll go shopping with Ricchan. Try inviting me as if I were Ricchan. No, no, that's too much! I can just invite her casually. I can say it casually. What would you say? "We're going to make Hamburg steaks, so do you want to go shopping?" Are you nervous? A little. Is your hair okay? -My hair? -Is it okay? I dunno, my hair... -I'm back! -Oh, welcome back! How are you? I'm good 'cause I got to go home early. Good job with work today. -Thanks. -Yeah, good job. What were you doing today? Today, I had a lesson. Singing? Dancing. We have a new release soon so... -Oh really? -Yeah. How are you? I'm good. You don't seem good. You really don't seem good. So along with Tecchan... it's your turn to go shopping. Momo and I are going to prepare the rice over here. Okay. Give me 10 minutes. -Shota, thank you. -Shut up. It's so easy to read Tecchan's face. So this is what it means to be able to read someone's face. Interesting... We're back! Sorry for the wait. 3rd WEEK: "SHRINKING THE DISTANCE WITH A HAMBURG STEAK" Okay, I'll start making the Hamburg steaks. -I'll do the potatoes. -Let's do these patties! Okay, I'll make the patties with Tecchan. Okay. When you need to dice it, make it face down like this. And pay attention to the surface here, to make sure there's some left at the end. And then you cut lines down here. Tecchan, you're good at cooking. -He's good at teaching, wow! -Yeah, he's teaching me. Like this? Wow! That's right, Tecchan's mother passed away early in his life, so he learned how to do these life skills, like cooking. That's wonderful. And then after that, that's about when they started to get really close. 4th WEEK: "THE NIGHT THE TWO OF THEM STAR-GAZED" Is everyone asleep? Everyone went to bed. -Oh, really? -Yeah. Today is... the day of the Orionid meteor shower. No way. Let's go see it! On the roof. That sounds nice. I want to see the stars. -You want to see them? -Let's see them. Oh, could it be that Ricchan's inviting him? Could it be that that onion-dicing maneuver made her realize... "Oh, he can cook! He's a upstanding guy." Ah! It's cute, seeing them look up like this. Look! It's cute, seeing them look up like this. It's cute, seeing them look up like this. Just kidding. -It's cold. -Yeah. -Let's share it. -OK. Under just one blanket... seems like things are going well. -Oh! Did you see that just now? -I saw it! I saw it! We saw it! -Wow. -Yay! Yes! Rie has been so busy in the entertainment industry and wasn't able to have a boyfriend. So she probably could never have anything like sharing the same blanket with a boy. -Good morning. -Good morning. Look at this, Tecchan. " 'If it's not a person important enough to me... that I'm willing to abandon AKB48, then I don't want to abandon AKB48.' " So doesn't that mean... that she won't date you, Tecchan, unless she feels you're more important than AKB48? I guess so. Alright, I'm gonna go take a shower. Ouch! It's like the eldest brother saying something mean to his younger brother. That was funny. And then with that... Tecchan became more determined and made a move. 5th WEEK: "BE BRAVE AND GO FOR THE DATE" I've never been to Yokohama. So I've been thinking I want to go. Yokohama? Ricchan, if you're off, do you want to go together? -Sure, I'll totally go. -You'll totally go? Got it. Thanks. What are we going to do there? Sightseeing. What are we going to see? I want to go to the Chinatown. -Also, I want to see that red brick something. -The red brick warehouse? Okay. I'll be looking forward to it. And then from there... a sudden change! 6th WEEK: "FIRST DATE" -The weather seems good today! -Right? -Yeah, we're lucky. -Yeah. Cause I'm always bringing the sun. I was gonna say that too. I'm always bringing the sun, too. HAKKEIJIMA SEA PARADISE, YOKOHAMA CREATURES OF THE SEA PAVILION It's coming, it's coming! So cute! -Does it look like a toothbrush? -It does. Oh, no!! Here we go! Enjoy your ride! I'm scared. You're so scared! -Wow. Oh, there's the red brick warehouse. -Yeah. Wow, Yokohama! Here it is! Today's Sugaya plan. MINATO MIRAI, YOKOHAMA -Really? -Yup, this is the end. Thank you for everything today. You're welcome. -Thank you... for giving me the day. -No, no, no. No, it was a really satisfying way to spend the day. Really? I'm glad. The Sugaya plan. How many points did it earn? You're asking that? I can't answer that! Come on. It was the best plan. But you didn't say a score. To avoid making it a kissing mood, she didn't look in Tecchan's direction the whole time. Someone in AKB can't ever kiss. So I guess they just go home... I was wondering how your date went. It was really fun, by any measure. Fun by any measure? After this date, have your thoughts about Tecchan changed compared to before? If... if he's seriously considering me, then I think there's still a possibility. But probably Tecchan isn't ready to step up. So the possibility of things with him becoming a romance...? I don't think it's there. There it is! Out. Once the two of us started hanging out more, I feel like it made it clearer to me. I felt like I couldn't depend on him. Take the aquarium, for instance. I noticed that I was always the one walking in front. I see, so even on the Yokohama date, it was like that... I think Ricchan definitely had a good time, but... women are surprisingly fast moving sometimes. 7th WEEK: "THE THINGS LACKING IN TECCHAN" By the way... On your recent date with Ricchan... you didn't hold hands, right? I don't hold hands. Why? You haven't ever jokingly held hands with a female friend or anything like that? No! -You haven't? -Of course not! Why? Tecchan, you don't have enough guts. Really? Not enough at all. Oh! What the heck? Become someone who can just grab a hand like this. Hey... hey, hey. Wait! Wait, wait. Tecchan, you're too cowardly. But it's embarrassing. I'm embarrassed. -That's all there is to it. --But... Ah, okay. Be brave! -Remember that. -I will. Tecchan, you're sleeping again? He's like his dad! "You're still sleeping, kid?" This isn't good, Tecchan, you're sorta sleeping too much. You're like this every time you don't have work. What are you gonna do? A 19 year old who sleeps all the time is a problem. Add more time to your part-time job! You're spoiled. How casually he says that! Since you and Shota-kun are somewhat of a rank higher than me. You both know what you want to do, and I think it's cool how stoic you are... since I don't have any of that... Tecchan, you don't need to cry about it. I'm not crying. This isn't something to cry about, Tecchan! You have something you're confident in. Tecchan, be someone that can face people once again, and try asking Ricchan out to a meal or something. I see. From Ma-kun's perspective, it must be like, "Just go for it!" And for Momo-chan too. "Just do it!" 9th WEEK: "TECCHAN'S DECISION" Cheers. -I want to become an actor. -An actor? -You want to get into acting? -Yeah, into acting. -I see. -We had no idea, right? No, we did not. Yeah, I didn't say anything. Oh, really? -So he wasn't just sleeping all morning. -Oh, really now? And so with that, there's also one more action I'm thinking of taking. What, so suddenly? It's unlike you. -Maybe I'm just riding this momentum but... -What is it? I'm going to invite Ricchan on another date. Where are you going to go? Kamakura. It slipped out of her tongue earlier that she wanted to go there. -You're really listening. -I am listening. So for a date do-over, right when he was about to give up, he asked her out for one. How will it go? 10th WEEK: "ONCE AGAIN ON A DATE" Sorry for making you wait. Okay. Okay. Shall we? That pink is cute. Oh, thank you. He smoothly complimented her. That's great. The sunset's so beautiful. Yeah, so beautiful. -Though it is bright! -It is. Right about here's where it happens. Ricchan, I... I've found what I want to do. Really? Yeah, I have. I want to become an actor. I wanted to watch over you until you found your dream. I'm also going to face my next dream... and put in all that I've got. Because of that, I'll be leaving Terrace House. You're leaving? I see. Yeah... But I'm really going to work hard. So keep watching. -Yeah, while becoming more manly... -Yeah, I will. I'm cold. Ah, no! Ouch... I have no words. He did try his best. He quickly brought out her hand. But, "Ah, no!" Was it really that she didn't like it? Or maybe... "I'll get in trouble with my teachers." 11th WEEK: "THE REAL REASON SHE THREW OFF HIS HAND" I spoke with Rie-chan... You spoke with her? She told me about your recent date. Really? -I asked her why she threw your hand away. -Yeah, yeah, yeah. 'Cause her heart skipped a beat. Tecchan, her heart skipped a beat. Tecchan... Really? She said she was so surprised she threw your hand out. Yeah, she was surprised her heart reacted so much. I see. So that's what it was. Ricchan's "Ah, no!" was her heart skipping a beat. Wow... She's like an old-fashioned girl from decades ago. How adorable. 12th WEEK: "THE LAST NIGHT" I just heard from Masato-kun. Of course that guy would talk. He really can't keep quiet. That's good. I'm glad. Ricchan, yeah... You're really going to be gone after tomorrow. But, you know... We really did a lot of things together. We made Hamburg steaks. You're right. We made Hamburg steaks. Do you remember how to dice onions? I'll be sure to at least remember how to dice onions after I'm gone. We watched the stars. We did. -The meteor shower. -That takes me back. Ah, so you lied about the shinkansen. -Yeah... So nostalgic. -You really had me there. These three months were really fun for me, too. I did many things for the first time, and I experienced so much. I realized over the past three months how nice it is when someone cares for you. I'm glad. I'll miss you, so I don't want you to go, but... I can't say that sort of thing. Really, thank you. Good luck. -Thank you. -Thank you. -Alright, good night. -Good night. Well, they didn't become a couple. But let's add in some new members and see what happens.
