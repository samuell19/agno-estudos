"In memory of Denis Héroux" "It is easier to smash an atom than a prejudice” - Albert Einstein "BACKGROUND CHECK" - You know, I've seen many strange cases throughout my career, but yours is quite something! - I know, I made a false statement. - A false statement? You failed to mention five serious incidents which are really going to have a huge impact on whether or not you'll get a verdict in your favor. Why did you lie? - Because you wouldn't have believed me. - Listen... I really want to help you out. But first... you'll have to start by helping your own case a little bit. So far, it doesn't look really good for you on paper. But, if you're able to clear up a couple of things and that your story sticks... I... might be able to save you from years of processes and delays. - That would be great, because at my age, I haven't got any time left to lose. - All right then. Tell me what happened! - It all began... at my ex-brother-in-law's birthday party. - I think we're the first ones here. - Oh no, are you kidding me? Oh no! We're not the first! - Don't worry, it's going to be fine. - What are we going to say? - I dunno! - I hate small talk! - Look, just find yourself 3 or 4 basic questions, like... - Like what? - "Hey, did you buy a new boat?" "Ever thought of getting a poodle?" - OK great, what else? - "Wow! Is that a new sofa?" - I don't think he's got this one in his collection. I hope he'll like it! - He'd better like it. It's a 38$ bottle! Why'd you put a lottery ticket in there? - Well, I picked the numbers from his birthday. And from his wedding anniversary... And you know he loves money so... I thought he'd like it... - I hope you're not just trying to impress him? The bottle... the lottery ticket. - Not at all! - Not even a little bit? - OK, yes, maybe just a little bit. - Well, you know, I'm glad that you like him. Because all my exes, they weren't really fond of Paul. They thought that he didn't have a shred of humanity. - Well, I guess Paul is just like your average rich asshole... But who's still sort of likable. - He has everything a man could want don't you think? - Of course not! You're the one who's going out with the prettiest of the 2 twins! - Oh, yeah, you're right! That's why I chose you honey. - Oh, you're cute! But I'm the one who chose you. - Hello! - Hey! Wow! You guys are early... Come on in! - So I started drinking a bit early. But maybe it was a good thing, because I'm not very good with people I don't like. But after a couple of drinks, I get friendlier, you know. But after a while, even with 400$ bottles, my stomach started to get a little upset... Especially since I don't have a very high tolerance for alcohol. So, the last thing I remember : Blackout. - Paul, calm down. You're a bit drunk. You mixed up the fours with the twos and the fives. And, that's fine! You didn't win 2 million dollars! Now, you're going to calm down and look at the numbers again. And I'm going to ask you for 15 seconds of concentration. 15...15. 30... 30. 38... 38! - Yeah? - Guillaume, it's me. I have a 2 million dollar question for you. - Go ahead. - If I were to win at the lottery, would I have to share with my wife? - I already told you, your wife has a right to half of everything. - Shit! - You've won the jackpot, you lucky son of a bitch? Who gave you the ticket? No one... It's just the moron at my dealership who forgot to fill up my new car. So I had to stop at a gas station, and the cashier was cute, so I accepted her offer to buy a lottery ticket and that's it. - You didn't stop annoying everyone at the office that you were buying a Tesla. - Yeah... - It's an electric car... - Yeah... - Paul, let me tell you something as your friend, not as your partner. So listen to me carefully : You have to give half the money to the person who gave you that ticket. - So first I have to give half to my wife, then half to the other dumb ass. And you, since we're partners and we share everything, I also have to give you half. And I wouldn't exist without my parents. So I'll give them their half too. What am I talking about? They're divorced! So it's one half each! Come to think of it, maybe I shouldn't claim the jackpot, or I'll end up losing money! - Add it up the way you want but you have to share it. - Or what? - All your neighbors, and your Facebook friends will think that you're an egocentric narcissist who only cares about money. - Yeah... I guess I'd prefer they didn't figure that out. I'll call you back. - OK. - Go away! - Paul? It's me, Francis! I'm sorry, it's just that I sort of clogged the downstairs toilet... You wouldn't happen to have a plunger by any chance? - Yeah sure! Give me a minute. - No problem. Take your time, no rush! - OK, Paul, you're going to open the door... you'll give him the plunger, you're going to tell him : "Francis, you're now a millionaire!" He'll start crying like a baby. You'll embrace him into your arms, and everyone's going to be happy! - Paul? Are you all right? - I've never been so ashamed... - Ouch! - Will you finally tell me, what really happened? - I told you! I was waiting for Paul to get me a plunger. Then he came out, with his nose covered in blood and he punched me for no freaking reason! - Bullshit! I just spoke to my sister. And she told me that Paul showed you his new car. You wanted to try it out, but you were a little too drunk, so obviously he wouldn't let you drink and drive! You tried to grab his keys, he stopped you, so you hit him in the face! - Your brother-in-law is freaking insane! - That's what happened isn't it!? - No! - You gotta learn how to hold your booze, buddy! - So, if I understand correctly, he stopped you from driving his new car because you were too drunk. - I don't give a flying shit about his cars! He's the kind of maniac who spends his weekends cleaning his cars with a toothbrush. I didn't want to have anything to do with his cars. Just imagine if I borrowed one of them and I came back with a small bug stuck on his windshield! He'd never let me hear the end of it! - On a scale of one to ten, how much alcohol do you usually take? Ten being the highest. - One. I never drink... usually. - And how often do you resort to violence? - Never! Zero. I'm telling you, I'm not a violent person. Sometimes I can get carried away, but worst case scenario... I get carried away with my words. - OK, keep that in mind, we'll get back to it later. So after your mother passed away, you found someone to sublet her apartment. - Excuse me, but it's sort of weird to go back and forth like this, don't you think? Is it? Is it really necessary? - It's the way I work, it's my method... - OK, I get it, you're trying to find out if I'm lying. Because you know that when you mix up different events together... Skip between different timelines and all, a liar is more likely to get confused in all his lies. But I'm not a liar, I swear! - Calm down! I call the shots in here. Let me do my job the way I see fit. - You're right. Sorry... - I'd like you to tell me what happened with your upstairs neighbor. - Well, it's quite simple really : she screwed me! Obviously, the whole place pis due for a bit of a makeover... My mom lived here almost all her life you know. That's the bed she got for her wedding. - Hey, does that mean that you were conceived here? - Oh yeah... Yeah... I don't really want to think about that! - It must have been a shock... to lose your mother like this. - Yeah, I guess... You're never really ready for that. - Yup! I'll take it. - The place is all yours... as soon as I clear it out. - You know what? There's just one little thing that I'd like to ask you. - Uh, OK, like what? - I just can't believe that you'd sublet the apartment at the same price that your mother paid. It's not normal that our rent is higher than hers! - I know, but my mom lived there all her life... - Exactly why you should've tried to make a profit on the sublet. You're really hopeless when it comes to business! - You know, honey, just tell yourself that we're lucky to have found someone to take back the lease. - What are we gonna do with your mom's stuff? - I... left her the furniture. - For how much? - For nothing. - Come on, Francis! You could've at least sold it to her... - I wanted to be generous. OK? That girl hasn't had it easy in life. You know, her Ex left her, he had the condo in his own name, and left her with nothing ... - Oh, you're such a nice guy! I think she's all alone tonight. Why don't go join her and cuddle with her in your mother's bed? - Ah, you don't get it! - Don't you think she's cute? - Come on honey that's not it, it's just that... I think we're cheap! When was the last time that we gave money to a charity? Or even just a buck or two at the grocery store? - Well, we went to a fundraising dinner just 3 months ago. I remember, the ticketswere so freaking expensive, for shitty cafeteria food. - Uh, you know your expensive tickets... your boss gave them to us. - Oh yeah that's right. I forgot... - Excuse me, did I say something wrong? - No, not at all, on the contrary! - OK, sorry. - You seem like a generous person. It's something rare nowadays. But in general, people who give a lot usually expect something in return. - Yeah, but that's a plan to be disappointed isn't it? - Hum. Tell me all about your encounter with Daniel Couture. Why? - Part of my job here, pis to dig through your past. To make sure that you really are the person that you claim to be. That's my job. Do you get it? - Yes, yes, I'm sorry sir. - Great. Now, tell me all about Daniel Couture. - Eh boy! So I had my bat and I was ready to strike. I wasn't really myself, you understand... - OK, stop. You're going a little too fast. Hum? Calm down. You're gonna start over from the beginning. OK? - From the start? Really? - Yeah! Just act as if I didn't know anything from your case. - OK... Well, Annie had just broken up with me. So I went to see my mom, because it cheers me up when I talk to my mom. Hey mom, I can't believe it's already been a year. Yeah, you're... you're surprised to see me here, huh? Well... I took the afternoon off, to spend it with you. Just the two of us! It's been so long since we've had time to chat. I have so much stuff to tell you! You know, the... the food processor you gave me? Well, a little piece of it just broke. And I can't use it anymore... And I know it's silly... but it's almost like if there was little a piece of you that I lost at the same time... Not that you're like a food processor, but you were so... You know, you loved to cook so much. So I applied for a new job last week, it's at a Zoo... Hello! - Hum hum. Sorry, it's... it's because my father's right there. - Hey, what's the odds, huh? I mean... Well, go... go ahead, I... I'll... - I won't be long. - Ah, no rush, I have the whole afternoon! It's all good. - Hey there, you old piece of shit! This is my new fiancée. Maurice, Honeybun. Honeybun, Maurice. - Nice to meet you, Maurice. Dan told me a lot of bad stuff about you. - Daniel? Daniel Couture? I'm so happy to put a face on your beard. I mean, a face on your name. Because I come here all the time to see my mother, and I always take the time to say hi to all her neighbors. And I usually have a quick chat with your father. He's a sharp man, really. - Is your name Daniel Couture or Dan Kelly? - I took my mother's name. - What are you taking about? Your mother's a Laviolette. It's written ... it's right there... Hey... Calm down dude... I didn't want to meddle... - Look, I don't really want to know. Anyway I'd rather be a Mrs. Kelly than a Mrs. Couture. - Come on, let's get out of here. - Hold on babe! We have a little father & son ritual. - What! Are you kidding me right now? Ark! Sorry, but right now you have your cock in my mother's face! Would it be possible to stick it back in your pants, please? I can't believe what you're doing! I just can't believe it! Come on! - Don't worry. It's just like cat litter. It absorbs bad smells. - It's been 8 years since he's passed. Let it go! - No, he's still here! I can still hear his God damn voice in my head. Every day he tells me that I am a fucking failure. A loser and a disappointment. On top of that, he's ashamed of what I do! - Well, from what I just saw, he's got a good reason to be. - Are you saying that my father's right? - No, no, I'm just saying that there are some things that you can't do... like urinate in an urn. - He thinks my father's right! - Choose your battles. - You bet! You know, when I was little, we were 12 children in the family. So when there was a problem, my father, he didn't have very much time to talk with us and go through his emotions. His only way of talking to us was with his fists. - Ah, that sucks... but the good news is, that you're an improved version. You're able to talk. - Not really. - Excuse me, madam. - So when you came out of the mausoleum, you took your car, and you followed him to his house. And then you called the police? - Uh... more or less - How impulsive are you usually? - Not really, but when it comes to my mother, I can be a little sensitive. - You wanted revenge? - My mother was a saint, OK? She's never done anything wrong. And she spent all her time helping out others. So I think that she deserves some respect. - You didn't really go into details earlier when you mentioned your break up with Annie. So I'd like you to go over it again. Because you know in the police report, it's a very detailed event. - Annie, um... she really was... my worst heartbreak ever. I didn't recognize myself anymore. I'd become possessive, jealous. But, it won't happen again. - You bet it won't! - Not him again! What? - I miss you! - Hey, get over it! It's been 6 months. I'm with Steve now. - We just have one life to live, right? - Yeah, so? - We get ourselves 2 tickets for Vegas, we rent a small condo next to Celine's house, we get married and we have children. - Great! Now, you listen to me very carefully, OK? - Sure, whatever you want, honey. - You need help! You're sick! - You think? - I don't think so, I'm sure of it! They'll give you antidepressants or something like that. - OK, I... I'll go to the doctor's. But in the meantime, I wrote you a poem. Can I read it to you? - I don't give a shit. - Giraffe sedative with eucalyptus. No, I can't take that stuff, it's too strong! Ah, it's organic, it must be OK. Ah... tastes like shit! - On a scale from 1 to 10, how much would you rate your drug use? - Zero! I don't do drugs... - OK. - Never, I'm serious! - And what about giraffe sedatives? In which category should I label that? - Natural organic products? - By the way, I can see here that you've been seeing a shrink ever since you were 18. - Yeah... you know at one point in my life, I decided that I wasn't going to be one of those guys who... dump all their shit on others and annoy everyone with their unresolved problems from childhood. So whenever I feel down I'd rather give my money to a shrink so that I don't have to be a downer to everyone else. - That's very wise. - Thanks! - Hi? What the fuck!? - Naughty girl! - Hey! What the hell are you doing? - Come on! Snatchbook! - Snatchbook? - Yeah! - Sorry, it must be the girl upstairs... Cynthia? Yeah... OK, hey, I'm so sorry. - Are you OK, honey? - Yes, darling, everything's fine! - OK, I'm really sorry. I... - Yes... it's upstairs. - OK. - Have a good day! - Yeah, you too, ma'am. - What're you doing? - Hey, check this out. It's like a dating app just for people who want to fuck! - Snatchbook? OK, uh, and what are all these red dots around our place? - Well, that's everyone that's um... available. - To fuck? Right now? - Yeah. Less than 5 minutes away! - Are you kidding me? - What's the world become! It's crazy. It's degrading! - Yes, yes, it's really lowering mankind to its most primary instincts, huh... No, really that's just putting love aside and reducing everything to pure sexual contact. No, no, no, hey, we're not sex dolls! - Honey... ... admit it! It turns you on doesn't it? - It's amazing, sweetheart! It's like a dream come true. You can fuck on demand! You know, it used to be that you'd have to drive up to an hour and a half to have a fling with a girl. Don't tell me that was good for the planet! Nowadays, you can go by foot... in a dressing gown. It's fantastic! - Yeah... Good night honey! - You don't think I'm right? You're the one who's always saying that we should get more local products! -Um hum. - In any case, one thing is for certain, you're not someone who is very stable in relationships. Over the last three years, you've been with Melissa, Julie, Annie, Solange... - No with Solange, it wasn't... I've never... All I wanted was to help her. - Oh, you wanted to help her, sure, but your name's all over the police report. And even Solange's own son is accusing you of forcing his mother to change her last will in your favor. - No! I mean, yes, but I didn't force her. - You didn't? - She did it all by herself, I swear. Solange, are you OK? - They stole my engine... damn thieves! - Your engine? Solange... You're engine's right there! - That's not my engine! Before I went to the mechanic yesterday, I had a V8. And when I came back I had a V6. - Well, hum, OK, but... how is it less efficient, I mean, your engine? - It doesn't have any torque. It doesn't have any power! - So, you're saying that your mechanic went through the trouble of removing your old engine and replacing it with a cheaper one? - Precisely! It's not everyone who paid for the upgrade! A V8 engine is extra. My Stephen, he worked overtime to afford that V8. - And did you tell your mechanic? - Of course, I told him! He gave me a lousy explanation. He made it seem like I was crazy. So, I called him a dirty thief and I left without settling his bill. - Solange! Get real, no one stole your engine. - You don't believe me? - It's not that I don't believe you, it's just that it isn't possible. You know it's the same with humans, as we get older, our cells sort of stretch. We get slower... you know, huh, we're not as fast. I guess that's not all news to you... Well with a car's engine, it's pretty much the same... Your engine is just tired. - You disappoint me Francis. If only my Stephen was still here... he never would've let that slide. Take care... - It's a V8! God damn crooked mechanic! - What do you want with me? - You know what I want! - So you believed her story? - Well, I did some research... on Google and I found out that V8 models, well, they come with V8 engines. The V6 models come with V6 engines, and the V4... - OK... OK I get the picture. - Great! So perhaps now you could try to explain how come Solange has a V6 in her V8? - I asked around to my guys this morning and no one knows. - But you've got to admit it's a bit odd, right? - Listen, you're not the only one who'd like to figure out what happened. - Since Solange's engine went missing while her car was in your garage, I just happen to have this feeling that you're the one who's responsible. So we're going to try to keep things simple, OK, you'll just go ahead and replace her engine with a new one. - Are you crazy? A V8 is worth at least 7000 bucks! - Ha! You know its price! - Of course I know its price, that's my job. It doesn't mean I'm guilty. - OK, look, personally, I don't give a rat's ass if Solange drives around with a V6 in her V8. If it were up to me, she could strut around on a scooter while drinking V8. As long as she's happy, I don't give a shit! The only thing that pisses me off is that crooked mechanics like you rip off helpless people while thinking that no one will ever notice it. That, truly disgusts me! I can't live with that. I don't sleep well at night because of things like that. - So you accuse me of being a crook! While I bust my agent Sans-Secret every day for my clients instead of being home with my children. That really pisses me off! - Very touching story. - If you're so convinced, then just sue me. - Great idea! I'll sue you. - You don't have any proof anyway. - Uh, yes I do! I have Solange's car as proof. - OK, 8 o'clock tomorrow morning, bring me her car. - That's much better! -Yes? Hum hum. Yeah, he's right here in front of me. OK... Very well, thanks. We just received your lab results. It's negative... - Oh! Great... that's really great! - You seem relieved. Were you afraid that we'd find something? - Oh, no, no, no! I know I'm clean. It's just nice to... make it official, you know. - Hum hum. - Hey... Hey! This is going to be the most important apology of your whole life! - Winner of the two million dollar jackpot? - Yes! Yes! - No no no! - "Should I share with my brother-in-law?" "Don't give him a penny, keep the money, let him rot in hell." I think I just understood what happened last night. - I don't care what you understand, and what you don't understand, you're going to put your ego aside for once you're going to call him right now to apologize! Don't forget that you're deeply sorry for everything. You put some real heart into it and then you congratulate him! - Congratulate him? - Yes! - I'm the one who bought the ticket! He's the one who should be here kissing my ass. Hello? - Hi there you greedy asshole! How are you doing this morning? - Ah, try to put yourself in my shoes, Francis. I go to the washroom... I take a look at the lottery numbers on my phone. And I notice that I just won 2 million dollars, eh. And the only thing I was wondering while I was glaring at my ticket, was trying to figure out a way to make sure that I wouldn't have to give you a God damn penny! After that, well, you know the rest. - If you didn't want to share, you didn't have to punch me in the face! - Oh, that's because I needed to make sure that my friends would understand why I wouldn't share the jackpot with you. - You know what? You're fucking insane man! - You know it's all your fault, right? If you hadn't given me a ticket, I wouldn't have had to choose between your friendship and money. - Ark! - That's why I'm successful in life. I never mix family with business. - That's so true. - I'm sorry I didn't believe you before. - I don't know if I'll be able to continue living knowing that we gave 2 million to the worst asshole in the universe. - Me neither... My sister... My sister, she can make this right! - You're wasting your time. Your sister isn't going to help us. - How much is it really worth, your relationship with your sister? Think about it. - You know, she owes everything to Paul. She'll do anything to stay with him! - She wants to play dirty? Well, I can play dirty too! - Fuck me! - Guillaume? Isn't that Paul's partner? - Yeah. - Hey, you know, your sister... she's just a slut. - I know. But Guillaume, you know he's... well equipped. - What about you, did you sleep with him too? - Yeah... But that was before I was with you. - You can't betray me like that! We swore that we'd never tell anyone. It was a secret between sisters! You want to fuck up my marriage, is that it? You're just jealous! Do you want me to tell you something? If only you'd listened to mom and dad and you'd found yourself a rich husband, not a God damn loser like your boyfriend. Well, we wouldn't be in this situation! You really want to fuck up my marriage? Well tell him you backstabbing bitch! - Its settled... We won't get a penny... and I never want to see my sister again. - When you think about it... she may be right. Why are you with a guy like me? - Because I love you... and I know that you love me. And we don't really need that much money to be happy, do we? - Yes. Well, I mean, we can live without it, but... - I mean think about it, we've never been as unhappy as we've been since this morning. - That's true. Come to think of it, if it hadn't been for his birthday, I never would've bought that lottery ticket. - Good point! - I love your bungalow. -And I love your old Volvo! - We don't need anything else. - That's so true! - You know what... they should keep the money! They need it more than we do! - Right on! In the end I guess... it's a good thing. - It's a great thing, because I love you honey! - I love you too! - The only thing that sucks, is that you're supposed to deserve a gift. - Holy shit... you're onto something! What? - "Deserve"? Is that what you said? - Yeah... - And they don't deserve it! We're going to get our ticket. - What do you mean? - We're gonna get our ticket back! It's ours! - You have 2 seconds to apologize to my mom. "NO!" Sorry? I didn't hear you. "You heard me! When I was young, my father..."” I know, your father hit you and I don't give a shit! "You're just a little skinny loser "who used to get his ass kicked in the schoolyard. "And it's still the same today, you're a God damn coward.” You're right! But that just changed. Sorry, I can't hear you. Oh, you'd like to apologize, but you can't speak anymore? So sad! Where is he? He needs to apologize to my mother. - Forget it. Dan is never going to apologize. You don't get it do you? Deep inside Dan is just an injured little boy who needs to be loved. - Ah, OK! That changes everything, you could've told me before. Silly me! Here I thought that he was just a crazy psycho who couldn't control his own emotions and who was always looking to pick a fight! I'm not leaving here without an apology! - I beg you, please! I'm sure that you're smarter than this! Give me your bat. - Mike, she knows my real name : Daniel Couture. - I still don't understand why you brought her there. - I told you, she really wanted to meet my father. - Your father's dead! - Do you think I don't fucking know that? I'm the one who freaking killed him! - You have 2 choices: either you get rid of her or you jump on a plane and you two get the fuck out of here. - Listen, I know that my new identity was expensive but I really love this girl, OK? Tell that to the boss. I'm going to run some errands. I'll have a little surprise for you when I come back. - Well... - Hum? - I'd really like you to apologize for what you did earlier. - You're right. I'm sorry... You never should've met my father! - Hold on! Thank you... - Don't thank me. I'm going to do what I should've done from the start : I'll go straight to the police. I know that you love him, but he's a God damn psychopath. And he should be locked up. He's a... Pfff! You know. Solange, where's your car? - I don't know... - That fat fucking fucker! God damn crooked ass hole! There you have it! Yes sir! Yes hi, I'd like to report a vehicle theft, please, at 4224 Remembrance. Yeah, and I can even describe the suspect to you if you want. He's currently wearing jeans and some kind of ugly jacket. Would you like to talk to him? OK, so hurry up please! It's the police, they're on their way! - Sure... Do you want to know what happened here? - No need! I know exactly what happened. You tried to get rid of the evidence and you got caught! So now you look like a guilty dumb ass! By the way, it's two separate thefts! The engine and then the car! So you're going to be charged for both, big guy. Well, I say big, but you're not that tall. More like a... fat gnome. A... hairy leprechaun... A mini Hagrid! - Police custody. Last night, Solange... she got chased by a police car. She drove through at least two red lights and it took a roadblock to finally stop her. Have a look! - Oh, shit! - By the way, I found the answer to your engine problem. When you're too cheap to buy a V8, you just get a sticker, it's a lot cheaper! Anything to say about that? - Well, I guess it's all good. It's... it's great. I'm sorry. I don't know what to say... - There's nothing to say... - Cool, well, let's not say anything then. - Perfect. Bye! - I'm going to fuck off then. I'm just going to grab my bike if you don't mind. - Yeah... whatever. - I'll just go through there. - Who's the dumb ass now? - Did you find my car? - Solange, why didn't you tell me that you'd ran away from the police? - You didn't ask me. You wanted to know where my car was. I told you, I don't know. - Solange, it's been 2 years since you've lost your driver's licence. It's over, now. - If only I'd had my V8, the cops never would've caught up with me. I want my car back. - Forget it, your car's been impounded. - It's the last gift that my husband gave me. I want it back in my driveway! - It's not happening! - Take the money from my safe. Bribe the police chief or whoever you need... I want my car back. - Sure, and who's going to drive it? - It's been like this for a week. I can't bare it any longer! - Sure, why don't you just go upstairs and ask them to fuck quietly. - Hello, lovebirds! "What's up?" - She's texting & fucking at the same time! - It's better than texting and driving I guess. "Are we making too much noise?" A little bit. "Is that better ?" Much... Much... better! - We should've done that way sooner. - What are we gonna do about the bed? "Have a good night!" - OK, Mike, you know that you're my best, but right now I've got a really big problem. Can you tell me why your guy was a no-show this morning? He was supposed to bring the passports across the border. - I told you, I'm already on it. It's just that my usual guy's in the hospital right now. - You know our clients, they paid us a shitload of money so that we'd help them get away from Donald. - I know... Well find someone as soon as fucking possible! - I'm on it, don't worry. Just give me a little bit more time, OK? "Cynthia : I'm at the bus stop, come get me"” - What are you up to? - Just hold on one second babe. I'll be right back. - OK. - You can open your eyes. - Oh honey! What's the occasion? - Well, it's been a full week since we've met. It's the first time that I've been with the same girl for so long. - And you're not tired of me? - No, on the contrary! I'd like to come and live with you. - I was hoping you'd ask! - Huh? - I was waiting for that! Wait, let's celebrate this properly. - Hum, hum, hum! Hello mister! - Hi! Hello... - Honeybun, I've got your surprise. Honeybun? Come on, pick up! Fucking bitch! She's gone. - Gone to heaven? - No, she just left. - You let her go!? - No, no, I went to get my Kit. I didn't want it to get blood and shit everywhere. It's my house God damn it! - OK, I'll check with the cab dispatch and call you back in ten. - Good. Watermelon! - Good day! Let me guess, you want a refund ? - Not really. Listen, sir, there's a stranger in our neighborhood and he's been giving toys to young children... and he gave this to my 6 year old yesterday. My wife and I fear that he may be a kidnapper so we'd like to know his name to... well let's just say we'd like to talk to him. - Looks like we only sold one in the last month and it was paid with a credit card. But... without a warrant. I can't really give you any personal information. You know, it's confidential. - I'm sure you could make a tiny exception in this case. Not really, no. Listen, I finish my work shift in 2 minutes, is there anything else I could help you with? - Sure, could I talk to the fucking manager? - I'm the fucking manager! - Come on, just give a concerned father a break. - You're not listening, sir, it's store policy. It's confidential, I can't do anything about it. - And what if I shoved this fucking bat up your ass? - I can't give you his name. But maybe I could give you his address. - It seems to me that before moving into a new apartment, You ask if you're allowed to bring your God damn dog first. Ah! Here it is! It's right here on the lease. "No pets allowed.” - Honey, it's only temporary. His brother's going to come and get the dog in about a week or so. - But why doesn't he just bring the dog to his brother himself. - Because he's got a criminal record. They won't let him cross the border and his brother lives in the States. - What about his girlfriend? - Cynthia? You've seen her. She doesn't even know how to drive! - Well, you know what, I think I'm going to stay at a motel until this whole thing is settled. - Honey, it's OK, I'll take care of it! I'll take the dog to the States myself. - Thanks. - Hey! - Hello, my sweet Francis! - Solange, what are you doing? - I'm waiting for my Stephen. We're going on a picnic. - Solange, he won't be coming... What about you? - Your sad to let him go, huh? - I'll miss him. I'm just happy to know that he'll be in good hands. My brother is a dog-lover! What do you think, Peanuts? You're going to be happy in the States? - I found this in your jeans earlier. You got him 2 days ago from the pet shop. And his name is Swirly. What are you playing at? - That's how I earn a living. - Using clueless people to smuggle fake Ids through the border? I'm telling you, no way! Francis, is a good guy. - Don't worry, I've done it dozens of times and no one ever got caught so... - Great, but don't use Francis, OK? Find someone else. - I don't have enough time. This is my last time, OK? I promise you. - No, I can't let you do it. - But he won't get caught. He doesn't have a record, he's not wanted by the cops, and he doesn't know anything, so... he won't look worried when he'll get through customs. - Sure, but what if he gets caught? How long will he get? - Seven years in jail. Well, look, we... let's not think about that. Think of all the refugees that we can help instead. There are people who are caught in bad situations in life, and they need a fresh start. And we can give them that second chance. - OK, cut the bullshit! How much are you making? - You mean... how much are we making? It's a grand per passport. We've got 50. But if you really don't want me to do it... well I won't... - If I'm not back in 5 minutes, call the cops. - Sweetheart! Are you sure that's a good idea? - We're not losing 2 million dollars today! - Stay calm, Francis! Stay calm, it's nothing, it's just 2 million. It won't change your life. Calm down... Just breathe. Be mindful! - I got it! - You're kidding! How did you...? - Her marriage is worth more than 2 million. - It's the... it's the worst and the happiest day of my life at the same time! - Me too! - I don't know why, but I'm really turned on right now! - Me too! - Who is it? - It's... she has it! - Sure, but you can have it back, here... we don't really need that much money anyway. - I heard my wife talking to you. She said, "Promise me that you'll never tell my husband.” Tell me who it is! - Hey... I don't want to interfere, but I think you must've misunderstood. - Look here, I'm gonna count to five. 1... 2... - Come on, just think about it, if you Kill us, you'll be in deep shit so... -3... 4... - It's Guillaume! It's Guillaume. Are you happy now? - I knew it... Now give me the ticket. - I'm the one who bought that ticket. I can do whatever I want with it... so fuck off! - What the hell did you do? - Shit's over! No more fighting! - You fucking dumb ass! - No... no more fighting... - You've got to be kidding me! - Un-fucking-believable! - What the hell is wrong with you? - Calm down... it's just money! - I can't believe this shit! - You're such a dumb ass loser! - It's just 2 million... - Two fucking millions! - OK, you two get the fuck out if here! Just tell me why? - I should've told you earlier. Are you mad at me? Yes! - Darling, I just want you to know that it doesn't change the fact that you're the one I love. Do you want a divorce? - No. - You're giving me a second chance? - Yes... - Well, thank you. - But I want you to promise me that... I swear that I'll never see Guillaume again. And if you want us to be even... You can sleep with any girl you want. - Already done. But you know, darling, I just want you to know that it doesn't change the fact that you're the one I love. - I love you too. - Would you like to marry me? And I said yes on the spot! - Oh yeah? Right here in this dump? - No, Francis. This used to be a beautiful field full of yellow tulips. The water was clean, the air was pure. And he had... his black Cadillac 64, straight out of the garage. He wore his sailor's uniform that looked so good on him. Everything was so perfect! - Yeah, and I can picture you at 18, you must've been quite a catch. - Oh, let's say that I made a lot of heads turn. - And I guess that's when you guys... Oh no, not before the wedding it wasn't allowed, back then right? - Well... To tell you the truth. I didn't bring you here just for a romantic picnic. - Thank God, because I was beginning to wonder. - I'm tired of being in pain. I'm tired of waiting alone. I'm tired of thinking about him every day and to live in the past all the time. So... I've decided to move on. And I'd like you to help me. - Whatever you need, Solange. I'm there for you. "I leave all my belongings to Francis..."” - I'd like you to do something for me? - Sure anything you want, but there's no need to give me anything in return, really. Seriously... - Fine. Hey, isn't that chloroform!? - I want you to drug me and then drown me in the river. So that I won't feel a thing. - OK great! And what am I supposed to do with the body? - Give it to science. - Come on, Solange! That's murder. - Burn it then. - Solange, I think you're seriously depressed right now. I've been there before, OK, and we can get you some help. - You think? - Of course. Just hang on OK? I'll just call in sick at work, and I'm going to take care of you. We're going to get through this! OK? - You're going to miss your work? - Sure, don't worry about it. - I Hello? - Hi, sir! You know, it's me Francis. I was supposed to have my first day of work tonight. We'll something's come up... Would it be possible to find someone to cover my shift ? - It's a bit last minute... - Yeah, I know that the timing isn't great... You know how it is with emergencies... You never know in advance if you're gonna have an emergency or not, but now it's really... OK, great, thanks, I really appreciate it. I'll come in tomorrow then. - Not really. - What do you mean? - No need. - What about next week? - Nope. - No need either? OK, well, I see... Hello? You there? Solange? No no no. Fuck, fuck, fuck! What the hell? Hey! No no no! Solange! Open the door! You can't do that to me. I just lost my job for you! Solange! Fuck ... Fuck. Fuck, fuck. Solange! It's not cool! You can't do that to me!!! Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. Solange! Listen to me carefully! I respect suicide with dignity. It's fine by me. But you've just put your will in my name. I have my fingerprints on your bloody knife. So I'm in deep shit! There are no witnesses. We're all alone in the middle of nowhere. No one's going to believe me. I'm fucked! Answer me, you crazy bitch! Come on! Open the fucking door! Open the fucking door before you die on me! Come on! I love my life! Kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty! - Hello! You've reached the voicemail of : Francis. Please leave a message right after the beep. - Hi, it's me. I thought about it and... if you were serious about leaving for Vegas, I'd like to give it a try. I love you so much! What am I gonna do with him? - What's your brother's cut on the passports? - Nothing... I don't have a brother. - Good, I didn't really want to share. Mike! It's the US customs! - Fuck! - What are you guys doing? - I am so sorry... - Wait, you're leaving? But... - Come on, Cynthia, let's go! - What about the lease? "US CUSTOMS" Hello? Hello? - Hey, I'm trying to reach Mike. The dumb ass, forgot to give me his dog's medical records, so they won't let me bring the dog through the border without it. - Honey. Get back in your car and come home right away. - Forget it, I'm not about to make another round trip just to get rid of his fucking Schnauzer. - Come home now! - OK. Sure thing, will do. Thank you! You know, when I found out about the passports, I was so freaking angry... that I went upstairs with a crowbar. And I hit as hard as I could on my mother's bed. - What about the dog? - I decided to adopt him. - I guess that's one of the reasons why it didn't end well with Julie? - Oh, no, no, she... she actually met someone else, on that fucking app of her's, Snatchbook. - OK, now I understand. So after being humiliated by an unfaithful woman, you decided to have your revenge. So, after getting a new urn, you had the good idea to bring Daniel Couture's fiancée, to your place. - Oh no, I didn't invite her! She's the one who wanted it. - She wanted what? - So it goes So life goes So life goes - And again. - So it goes, life goes So life goes So life goes So it goes Hey, you're really good! - Not at all, you're so much better. I'm not a really good singer. - You're very good. - Hey, thanks for spending some time with me... It was nice. You really put some sunshine back on this really shitty day. And I also wanted to thank you... for the urn. - Yeah it's pretty isn't it? Well, it's a ... it's a gift from Dan and me. - Well it's very nice of you. Very... - You know that's actually, the urn that I wanted to buy when my mother died ... It was too expensive... so I bought an ugly one. But she would've liked that one... - Yeah, that one's very nice. - Really. So I'd really appreciate it if Dan could apologize. So that I wouldn't need to report him to the police. I'd really feel bad if I had to go to the cops after all the gifts you got me. - Yeah. Listen, I... I don't want to hurt you, but Dan, is never going to apologize. And you're not going the police. How come? - Well, because you're going to pass out any second now. - Ah, did you drug my coffee or something? - What are you fucking doing here? - Oh no, I gave you my own address! I had this feeling I'd seen your face somewhere before. You've been on the most wanted list for a while, Mr. Couture! - Wow, you're just asking for a bullet in your head are you? - Oh... I called the cops on you! Oh! That's me... Pff... Sorry. Hey, have a nice day! - I won't tell you my whole story... but before I met Dan, I was on the street. He saved my life. So I feel like I owe him. Now because of you, I know that he's wanted by the cops, but I love him and I don't want to lose him. So when he's in trouble like this shit we're in now... Well, let's just say I owe him one. But you... you just couldn't let it go! "MOMMY" But now you're going to let it go for good! Have a nice trip! - Francis, I have to tell you a secret. I'm pregnant. - Wait, you got pregnant with... Steve? - Not really... I just wanted to see how he'd react... To see if he really wanted to have a child. But he didn't take it well and he told me that he'd leave me if I didn't get an abortion. - Wait, OK, so just to be clear, you guys had a fight because you didn't want to get an abortion from your fake pregnancy, and you didn't tell him the truth so he left you. Is that it? You ironed Steve? No, OK, uh ... He... where's Steve now? - In the trunk of my car. - Sorry, I don't like to curse but it has to come out. You're one God damn crazy bitch! - No, but the good news is that he's still alive. - Ah, OK, great! - But he wouldn't stop ranting about how he was going to put his best lawyers on my ass and sue me for attempted murder. - Well I hate to break it to ya but you're in deep shit! - Don't worry, I have a plan to make sure that we can both get out of this mess. - Uh... both of us? - It's quite simple, you and I, we're in love, we never left each other. You got me pregnant... And we'll say that Steve has been following me like a God damn stalker for the last 6 months. We'll say that he was sexually harassing me, that he followed me here at the zoo and that you had to come to my rescue. - With an steam iron? - Yes. - OK great! Great plan. OK, first... give me your car keys babe. Now, you're going to go wait in my office right now and you'll stay there, OK? I'm going to take care of Steve and I'm going to call the cops. And you'll have to answer for what you've done to him, OK? - I beg you, I came here because I needed your help. - No, you came here to use me like you always do. But it's not working this time. Look, you shouldn't have come here, because now I'm a witness. And do you know what a witness does? It testifies about what it saw. And what did I see? I saw that you're nothing but a lying bitch. - You told me this was to protect me from assholes. Well, thanks! - What a story! - But I think it all happened for a reason. Because, you know... when I was an inch away from becoming pet food, I realized that... I only had one regret in life. And now... I'm lucky enough to have a second chance. And that's why I'm here. - Now it's my turn to tell you the truth. Your request has already been denied by our committee. But I still wanted to meet you in person. Listen... you don't have to be ashamed of what happened to you, on the contrary. I think it makes you... a better man. You know what? I'm going to approve your adoption request. - Really? - Absolutely. - I was raised by a single dad. And I still had a great childhood. My father always told me... It's better to raise a child alone than to stay in a bad relationship. - So... I'm going to be a father? - Yes. And an excellent one if I might add. Thank you so much! I... I can't believe it. It's like the best gift that... life could give me. I guarantee that I'll be worthy of the trust that you place in me. I swear! - I don't doubt it for a second. Here... Sign there. - It's such a beautiful name : Vanel. She's so cute, isn't she? - Very much. Well, congratulations! Can I ask you a personal question? - Yeah, sure. - Honestly, how does it feel to win two million dollars? - Well it hurts! Because my ticket, it was like all shriveled deep underneath the edge of my tongue. Where you can't really reach it you see... And I couldn't really remove it from there. So at Loto-Québec, they used tweezers to remove the ticket and they hit one of my nerves so that hurt like hell! - And did you share it? - What do you think? - You can call me Jack. - Ah, delighted! My name is Francis... Oh, yeah, sorry, you already knew that. - It was a pleasure. We'll see each other next week to finalize everything. Uh, and one last thing. Maybe think twice before you give a Taser to your new girlfriend. - Ha! You bet! Never again! We have to learn from our mistakes, huh. - What are you still doing here? We're done! The movie's over. It's time for the end credits. So, I'm Emmanuel Bilodeau, I was playing the part of Francis. For those who didn't recognize me with my beard... Bobby Beshro played Paul.
