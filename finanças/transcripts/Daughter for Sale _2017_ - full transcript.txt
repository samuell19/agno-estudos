Well, young lady, how does it feel to be our newest judge and the youngest in State's history? It's surreal. But I think it'll hit home when I start my caseload. Here, here. Yeah. Oh, will you excuse me a second? Thank you. Judge Smith. Hey. Look who's here. I didn't see you come in. Just arrived. Yeah. What's um... what's he doing here? Oh, I invited him. He's my friend. You know, just like you're my friend. We've done some charity work together. Mmmhmm. Is that all he is? A friend? Friends. We're all friends. I don't think that's any of your business anymore, right? Annalise? I'd like to introduce you to John Gallant. He's the man I told you about who operates the shelter for homeless teens. Yes, I-I do know John. Judge O'Neil. Well, that title looks good on you. But then I think everything looks good on you. John. Do you say that to all the judges in this town? He's never said that to me. That's not true. This is my dear friend, Donna Johansson. Of course. Good to see you, John. Donna. And Detective Derek Sutton. Detective Sutton. John. Hey, uh... no Carly? Well, she's upstairs. You know, today evil teen, yesterday happy teen. Ah, the teen brain. A mysterious vortex. No amount of research can unlock those mysteries. Well, that's right. Well, you would know. I have seen my share. I didn't know you had a daughter. Yes, she is 16 going on 35. Well, she must be a handful if she's as beautiful as you. Yes. It must be hard to be a single mom and a professional. Well, I do think that my training as a single mother will help me as a judge. Too true. I'm getting a drink. I'm-I'm coming with you. Great. Welcome. Hey. Ever knock? Put the dress on and get downstairs. You put it on. It's your party. I'm getting really sick of this attitude, Carly. I said that you could see your dad but after school was over. Two weeks vacation in the middle of final exams? Unacceptable. It's not fair. Dad wants to take me to Europe. All you ever do is work. Get downstairs and politely greet our guests or you're grounded. And I mean it. ♪ I lost you today, ♪ ♪ Thinking I could make you stay, ♪ ♪ So I reach my hands out, ♪ ♪ Try really hard to reach my hands out, ♪ ♪ And now you sit alone... ♪ Excuse me, everyone? Dinner will be just in a few minutes. ♪ Thank you for your patience. Good? Ok. ♪ Hey. She's treating me like a kid. I'm coming over now. What about my parents? They won't know. It's not like I haven't done this before. Just meet me at the park. ♪ ♪ You risk it all for good days, ♪ ♪ Risk it all for nothing 'til the end, ♪ ♪ You're 'til the end... ♪ ♪ Drive safe. Nothing like ending the day with a fight with your teenager, huh? Ok. Carly? Carly? Hey- Carly? Carly! Carly? You ok? She's gone. Well, it's not like it's the first time. I know, I know. She's probably at her friend's house or something, but I just can't handle all of this drama. She'll be back when she cools off. She's just like someone else I know. Tomorrow's her birthday. See? Now we know she'll be back. No princess can resist presents. Yeah. I can't believe she won't let me go with my dad. It's so unfair. Are you even listening? Look, your mom's gonna call my house like a million times looking for you. You always go back. Not this time. I'll figure something else out. Like what? Don't worry about it. What, get a job flipping burgers? Get some scummy apartment? Not quite your style. Now that she's a judge things are only gonna get worse. Why don't you come with me? It'll be an adventure. You're nuts. I didn't have a fight with my parents. You never support me. Carly, just go and apologize to her and get it over with like last time. Forget it. This is a waste of my time. Promise me you won't tell my mom. You know I won't. Just go back. Hi, this is Annalise O'Neil. I know, I'm sorry that it's so late. Listen, have you seen Carly? We just-we got in a fight and... Hi, mom. Hey, listen. Have you seen Carly by chance? Ok, um, well if you or Katie see her can you just give me a call please? Carly, it's mom. Listen, it's-it's enough, ok? Please just come home. Get it right there. Oh, that's right. Bearly Bear is my most trusted confidant. You can't take him. Together we will rule the world. This is Carly, do your thing. Hey Carly. It's me. Listen, I'm really sorry that I yelled. Just please come home. I love you. Hello? Hey, Annalise. Oh, hi John. Is it a bad time right now? Yeah, no, it's not a bad time, I just-my daughter and I got in a fight last night and she took off, so... Your daughter? Yeah. I- I wanted to ask you if you wanted to go out for dinner. Oh, well I-I'd love to go to dinner with you. Yeah, it's just that now's not a very good time. Ok, well we could do it another time then. Ok. Thank you. See ya. Hey. Hey there. Need help? It's getting cold out. I'm fine. Thanks. I don't want to hurt you, I want to help. Look, I'm not some doe-eyed girl who needs to be rescued so leave me alone before I call the cops. Hang on a sec. Wait, wait. My name is John Gallant. I run a youth shelter near here. Seriously? A youth shelter? Like I said, I don't need your help. Just take it. If you need free hot food then come by. It's not a lot, but it might help. Take it. My number's on the card. Call me any time. Hey, it's Katie. I'm not here, leave a message. Got one. This is her. There. She could be anywhere. Yeah, well, we keep looking. Unless you wanna explain why we don't have her. Ah, there she is. There we are. Hey! Hey! Oh my god, are you ok? Yeah. Holy crap. Did you see his face? No. Look. I'm gonna call the cops. No, no, no. No, he's gone. They're not gonna do anything. Do you have anyone I can call? No. Oh my god. You must be freezing. Look, I've got an extra coat in the trunk. We'll figure it out. Come on. Here, I'll just get it out of the trunk. It's just over here. Ok. Um, I've got some sweaters... um... Are you serious? Oh, great. Cops. Just stay calm, alright? She's out cold. Come here. What's the big hurry? Uh, sorry officer. Is this your car? Yes, yes it is. License and registration. Uh, yeah. Um... can you grab that for me? You two lovebirds move on before I change my mind. Thank you so much. Slow down. Help! Help!! Somebody! Nothing. Somebody help me! Woah. Try that again and you'll regret it. You best shut her up if you know what's good for the both of you. You can't keep us here. This is against the law. Awe. You see this guy? He doesn't care about the law. So shut up! Are you ok? Just do what they say. How long have you been in here? Um... two weeks? Maybe more, I don't know. We're gonna get out of here. I don't think so. Morning. Morning. Why hasn't she called? I'm supposed to remind you about your swearing in ceremony. I'm aware I'm being sworn in. Oh, um... I'm sorry. My daughter and I got in a fight last night and... she ran away. It's a bit of a reoccurring theme. Can you just try to reschedule for me? I need some time to try to track her down. Oh, sure. I'm sorry to hear about your daughter. I'll call Judge Smith right away. Thanks. You know, it's just been a day, but this time it feels different. Normally she just seems like a little girl throwing a tantrum, but this time she felt older. A bit less... dependent on me. I think they call that “growing up”. She can take care of herself. Uh, somebody brought you a present, by the way. Ooh. Let me know if there's anything else I can do. Thanks. Hey, I'm here to see Annalise? Just a second. Sure. Derek is here. Oh, right. Hey. Hey. For you. Thank you. Have you even got any sleep? Mmm, no. Uh, any word? Call? Anything? Nah. Nada. She probably camped out at a friend's place, making you suffer a bit. Yeah. Well, it's working. You know, you need to get your mind off all this. Ha ha. Let's go out on a date tonight. A date? Like last time? Yeah. Yeah. That was-it was very romantic. You took me to a gun range and taught me how to shoot a handgun. Yeah, well, I just wanted you to be able to protect yourself, and it was kinda sexy. Well, it was hard enough dating you as a lawyer, but now... now you're a judge and it- Right. It makes things a little... You know that we're not together, right? Yeah, but hey, maybe we should be. Really? Really? Yeah. My daughter is missing and you wanna go on a date? See this-this is why... you know what we should be doing is we should be checking her cell records and her bank records to try to track her down. Seriously? Yes, seriously. Why? Why? Because you're a judge. You know better. She hasn't been gone 24 hours. You'll never get warrants for that. You know what? I'm her mother and I can sign a few warrants. I will put some guys on it, but you have to stay out of it. There's a little bit of conflict of interest here. I want to find my daughter. And I've seen how warrants fly around this building. Annalise. I will find-we will find her, don't worry. Ok. Just... Really? Yeah. Fine. She is special. She's got that look and she's a virgin. A virgin? Mmmhmm. Well, you're right. She is special. She's got that fire. She's a girl and a woman all at the same time. Very rare. I want to put her in the show. The show? She'll never cooperate. She'll cooperate with the right motivation. Look, she isn't trained yet, alright? She's dangerous. So is her mother. I want to promote her as a wild card. The buyer can train her as they like, but she's got good breeding. A good foundation to build on. Who the hell's her mother? Judge Annalise O'Neil. A judge? No. We gotta get rid of her. She's seen all of us. It's not worth it. Oh, she'll be worth it. She'll be worth a fortune if we act quick. Just get her ready. Get a show lined up as soon as possible. She's gonna take both of us down. Just do what I say. Screw up and I'll bury you. I have a lot at stake here, too, alright? I'm just saying this risk better pay off. I brought you on but we're not equal partners. Get out. Judge O'Neil? I know you have your mind on your daughter, but- Not now. Not now. No, but these things can't wait. Yes, they can. Look, I'm sorry, I'm really worried. Yes, I know, but- Look, just try and deflect everything for now, alright? I know that this has been hard on you, too. I know that I'm not making your job any easier. I understand. But let me know, ok? Ok, so... Oh, Carly. You're ok. Come on, come on, come on. This is Carly, do your thing. What? She just texted. That's strange. Hmm. Who? Hi, Annalise. Listen, thanks for coming. I appreciate it. Mitch, don't you have something to say? Mitch, where is she? Son, it's important. She made me promise not to tell. She could be in danger. You don't understand, this isn't some game. I know. Ok, I know. When did you last see her? A couple of nights ago. Ok. We were at the park. Right. Where is she? I don't know. She got mad and left. I haven't heard from her since. Nobody at school has heard from her, either. I'm sorry. She said she had somewhere to go and... No. I thought she'd be ok. Great, thanks. Derek. Derek, hey. Hey, what's up? Any luck on the GPS? The guys tried but she must have turned it off. Ok, well I can't just wait around. I need to go out looking for her. We got guys looking. Get some rest. Be there if she comes home. I don't wait around that well. Annalise... hey. Hey, Annalise? Thanks for doing this. I feel like it looks awful. I look like a nun. I'm sorry but that's as much as they would let me do. At least you won't be tripping over it. Have you heard from her? She texted me, so I called her back and her voice mail is full. Hmm. The cops had been tracking her GPS, then they lost it. I don't know, maybe she turned it off. Maybe you should call that John Gallant guy. He seems to know about runaway teens. I'm kinda surprised that you haven't called him already. On my behalf, of course. No, I was waiting for you. Look, we're clueless. We have no idea where to even start looking. He might have some ideas. I know. You're right. I can't believe it's come to this. I can't even believe that this is happening right now. We'll find her, hmm? She's smart. She's got that from you. She's stubborn, too. Well, we can't pick and choose our genes. Otherwise we'd both be ladies of leisure. I could use some leisure. Right? We went for ice cream after that. Where are you, baby girl? Hi. Glad you could make it. Yeah. Any news on your daughter? No, not yet. But I brought you these. Oh, excellent. I'll make sure we hang them up. Would you like a tour? I'd love one. Come on in. Stacy, can you hand these out please? This is obviously the shelter. Then over here we have offices... Uh huh. For our counsellors. And then the next room here is our kitchen. This is where we hand out food, toiletries, blankets, basically whatever we can get our hands on. Do they sleep here? No, we're not set up for residential so we have to close at 11:00. That's too bad, especially with this cold. Yeah, well it's part of our long-term plan. Hmm. So where's your business? Back here. Oh. Here we are. We import and export fine furniture. See, the shelter uses the storefront I had no need for. Of course the staff is paid for by my charity and they help keep the kids off the streets. Get them drug-addiction treatment or life skills coaching, we lead them to resources, employment centers, that kind of thing. She's not here. I had the staff ask around. No one's seen her. Well, I can only hope that she ends up in a place like this. Come on. I'll show you the rest. Over here we have our old cedar mill. We took this property over about 12 years ago. Hey. Hey. Thanks for meeting me. Any opportunity to see you and enjoy some pastries. You know, this is the longest that she's been gone. I've looked everywhere for her. I called her friends, everything. It's just like she's up and vanished. I filed the missing persons report, all the guys are looking. I'm still sure that she'll turn up. Yeah. Well, I wish that I was so sure. You know, with this cold coming in I'm just starting to get scared. Yeah, she's probably discovering the joys of couch-surfing. I wouldn't worry. You need to get some rest. You look terrible. This is what parenting looks like. It's part of the job description. Last time I checked you didn't want kids. And now for an update on a news story I brought you earlier. Another teenaged girl has been missing for over a week in the area. Now, police are still saying it's teens running away, but the striking similarities between the girls is hard to miss. The experts that we talked to suggest that there may be an indication of human trafficking in our area- Human trafficking? What do you know about this? It's an active case, I'm the lead investigator. I shouldn't be talking about this. This is me that you're talking to. Those girls are nothing like Carly. They each have a history of risky behaviour and living on the streets. But they look so much like her. There's a pattern we're following. Carly doesn't fit. I really can't be talking about this. Then don't. Annalise... I know this must be a very difficult time for you. I hate to ask, but I keep getting calls for meetings and work. What do I do? Can you just hold them off, please? I just can't deal with it right now. You know, maybe if you just get through some of these documents I could make some of the calls go away. And what are they? Those are the minutes from the judiciary meetings. Judge Gold asked that you review them so that you're up to speed on some of the issues they're discussing. Carly. Yes, hi, this is Judge Annalise O'Neil. I have an urgent question about a photo of a teen girl on page 4 of today's newspaper. Yes. I need to know when and where the photo was taken and I'd like to speak directly to the photographer, please. Thank you. No. No. No. Next. Next. No. She looks like a junkie and she looks scared. We need sultry and innocent. They're fine, ok? They're pretty enough. Look. She's not working out like I thought she would. Now re-do them. But I don't think we're gonna be able to put her in the show. She's just not ready. Annalise. Hi. I hope you don't mind. I just let myself in. Well, actually we should talk to security because we do have a lot of valuables around here, but I'm glad you're here. This is my assistant, Chelsea. Pleased to meet you. I really hope they find your daughter soon. Thank you. I know I'm early but I'm just not very good at waiting these days. Understood. Well, I have some places I think we should check so let's get going. Great. 'Cause I have no clue where to start. Thank you. This is the last place that she was seen. Come on. Let's put up some posters. Excuse me, have you guys seen this girl? No? Hi, excuse me. Have you guys-have you guys seen this girl? We're looking for this girl. Have you seen her? No, sorry. No, you're good. It's ok. Thank you so much. Alright, thank you. Thank you so much, I appreciate it. Ok. I wish that I could have taken you some place a little better to eat. So what's Carly like? She likes to think that she's tough and street-smart but she has no idea. You know, she's the kind of girl that lights up a room. She's magic. People can't stop looking at her. It's like she's got this magnetic quality. Let me get that for you. Thanks. No problem. Well, just don't give up hope, alright? I promise you I will do everything in my power to help bring her back. Thank you. Yeah, set it up for tomorrow night. Contact our top guests. $10,000 just to view the merchandise, purchase price to be negotiated. Oh, and tell them one of them really lights up the room. She's magnetic. People can't look away. Expect the bidding to be hot. Why did you run away? My stepdad was beating on me and no one believed me. You? My mom and I got in a fight. It was stupid, so stupid. Do you know where we are? Uh, there's a factory upstairs I think. I don't know. Alright. Put these on. You've got half an hour to get ready. Why? Big show tonight. You girls are the stars. You'll want to make a good impression if you know what's good for you. More pictures? So. Tell me about the smuggling ring. Annalise, you of all people know that I can't comment on an active investigation. Really? 'Cause you seemed to be able to comment when you said that she didn't fit the profile. And I think she does. Seems like it's pretty common knowledge being that it's all over the news. You know it isn't. You know what John thinks? He thinks that the police should share information so that he can warn these kids about what's happening. He does, does he? What else does John do? He helps me look for Carly. This is my daughter, Jenny, and she's been missing for over a month. Please. If you know anything about her whereabouts, contact this number immediately. And Jenny, if you can hear me, please, we love you and we won't stop looking. The family of Jenny Lowe is offering a $100,000 reward for information- I should do that. No. Yes. No! The more people know about this, the more people can see them and we can find them both. No, no, no-we told her not to do it. It's not gonna help. A reward like that is gonna make every money-grubbing loser send us on a wild goose chase keeping us from the leads that we have. Just let us do our jobs! Judge O'Neil, it's Stacy. Please call me immediately. I can't hold them any longer. You could lose your job. This message has been deleted. Lawrence. What a surprise. I can't seem to find you at work so coming here was my only other option. Well, please. Come in. Actually, I can't. I have to be in court, which is where you should be. I will be, I promise. I heard you want to go to the media with this. I would strongly advise against that. The police are working on it, everyone who works with youth in the city is working on it. Let them do their job, and you do yours. Going on TV won't help you or your daughter, but it can taint the mind of any jury or lawyer you sit before in court and that kind of damage is very hard to undo. Think about that. What would you do if it was your daughter? I have to be in court. So do you. John Gallant speaking. Hi. It's Annalise. Look, I need your help. I can help get the media involved, but are you sure that's in Carly's best interest? Well, I have to do something. It's all I can think of. Maybe someone's seen her. To be frank, my fear is that the people that have Carly if, as you say, she's being held against her will, may harm her as a result of the publicity. Don't you think I've thought of that? I need to find her. The longer we wait the more danger she's in. I have to take that chance. Ok. Well, let's make this happen. Really? Yeah. Oh. It's gonna be ok. Thank you. It's gonna be ok. Thank you. You're welcome. Judge O'Neil's office. Uh, no, I'm sorry, Judge Smith. I'm not sure when she'll be in. She hasn't turned up yet. Yes, I'll leave another message. Thank you. Thanks for coming. My daughter Carly was... she's been missing since the night of the 12th. No one has seen her since. Please, if anyone has any information regarding her disappearance please contact the local authorities. I know that there are a lot of other girls missing, but... she's my daughter and she's all that I have. Carly, if you're watching this, please don't give up. I am not giving up. I love you. I will find you. Thank you. A truly frightening story that hits close to home. If anyone has seen Carly O'Neil or any of the other missing girls, they're being asked to contact their local police department immediately. I'm Susan Smith reporting live for KVPO. Halt! Are we live? The guests have all arrived? Mmmhmm. Alright. This is very important. If you do good, life can be good. If you mess up, life can be very bad. You got that? Alright, you're gonna walk slowly, smile, and look like you're having fun. And you're going to do absolutely everything you are told to do. No slip-ups or there's gonna be hell to pay. Are we clear? Are we clear?! Good. And we are live. Alright, gentlemen. You don't meet young ladies like this every day. Let the bidding begin. Walk slowly to the middle. Slower. Put your hands through your hair. Slowly turn. That's right, darlin You want to be here. Smile. Gorgeous. Lie down on the couch there. ♪ Sold. Next. Hey! No! Stop! Don't hurt her! She's just scared! Stop! Your friend will be fine. Mess it up and I may reconsider. You better put on a good show or your friend might not make it through the night. Get in there. Alright. Sorry about that. We have our last beautiful lady. Keep the bidding coming in, boys. There we are. Smile for the camera, sweetie. Nice and warm. Warm up that gorgeous face. It's not working. More. Give me more. Smile. More. More. Smile. Smile. Smile!!!!! Come on. Keep it coming. That's right. Beautiful. Come on. Yes! I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry! It won't happen again, I promise! I promise! I promise! It won't! It won't! It won't! Are you ok? No. We're never gonna get out of here. We can't give up. You had to go on TV with the judge. A guilty man wouldn't be seen on TV with the mother, would he? You're so worried about that woman. I... you are not the only one with something to lose if this goes bad. Alright, I am not going down with you. Are you telling me how to do my job? By staying close to her I know more about the investigation. It's called being smart. You should be grateful I gave you this job instead of sending you off like one of them. Chelsea. You know, I'm just growing so tired of this arguing. Why? Why? Do as I say and get her ready. Tell Edwards to go after the judge. Hey. I know you. I saw your pretty little face on TV. Back off! The girl doesn't want to be found. Carly. Come with me. Why? Look, we can do this the easy way or he can help you do it the hard way. Your choice. Hello, sweetheart. We're here to talk about your future. Who are you? Really? I'm the man who currently owns you. You are my property. But soon you'll be someone else's property. I suggest a... a change of attitude is in order. If you step out of line, even just a little bit, I'm afraid your... your mother will have to suffer the consequences. How do you know my mother? Carly, if you can hear this, please don't give up. I am not giving up. I love you. Now, very soon you will meet a vey special client who has flown half way around the world just to meet you. He expects to meet a young American princess. I think that's you. Hey. Come on, sweetheart, don't be scared. Hey. I know you'll cooperate. Don't even think about trying anything. Or your pretty little mom's gonna pay. That's hers. She doesn't go anywhere without it. She would never give it up. Well, I've got it now. What did you do to her? Nothing. Nothing yet. You might want to think about that. Where's Jenny? She broke the rules. But you said if I cooperated she would be safe. I did what he told me to! Jesus, Annalise. Annalise! Annalise! Annalise, I told you not to go on TV. I- What? Who the hell did this to you? Uh, I don't know. He was wearing a dark hoody. He had glasses on. I don't know. Just... it all happened so fast. Well, we got the whole department out looking. It's our highest priority. Why? What do you mean, why? Yesterday she was just a runaway teen and now she's highest priority? Hey, what changed? I need to know. You can't go spreading this like you did on TV. You could put everything at risk. Especially Carly. I need to know. No. There's a human trafficking ring operating under the city. They ship the girls overseas. Prostitution? These ones are more targeted. Higher class. They're bought by wealthy men. Usually mafia, drug cartels. They're more like captured brides. Do you know who's behind all of this? We're not 100 percent sure. There's no evidence, just rumours. Who's behind all of it?! We're doing everything we can. Right. I'm sorry, I can't say more. Sutton. Where? I'll be right there. There's a body. Come on. Carly? Annalise? Hey! Wait, guys, she's with me. Let me go! Annalise, you can't- Will you let me go?! It's not her. Come on. It's not her. Come on. Annalise, come on. Just... It's not her. I know. It's ok. It's ok. No, it's not ok! It was Jenny. What about her mom? Come on. The next one could be Carly. We'll find her. We'll find Carly. Come on. Uh, excuse me? Do you mind? No, I wanna know. Hey, did you take this picture? I don't have time for this right now. Listen. I need to know. This girl is my daughter, alright? I need you to tell me anything that you know about when this photo was taken. I saw a black SUV. Ok. Anything else? It circled around the block. That-that's... that's everything, I swear. Alright. Where did you go? Teens run away. Where do they go? Where are you, Carly? Gallant import and exports. Now buying and selling a dazzling array of antique furniture that's right for you. We'll sell you the finest pieces at reasonable prices or pay above market value for your possessions and send them across the world. Gallant Import and Exports. Gallant Import and Exports. Call us today. You bastard. The girl doesn't want to be found. Back off. The girl doesn't want to be found? Not Carly, but “the girl”. He didn't know her, or else he would have said her name. Why did he take the locket? The locket, it doesn't have any value, it's not worth anything. Come on, Annalise, you're a lawyer. Work the case. What are the facts? He took the locket but not the wallet. Why did he take the locket? Because... she would think that I was in trouble. Hang on, Carly. I'm coming for you. It's perfect. They come to him. Got you. This is Carly, do your thing. Annalise. Oh, I was, uh... I was just looking for you. Oh. You found me. What happened to your face? Is everything ok? Oh, oh. Um, I'm... you know, I'd rather um, not talk about it. Do you come down here regularly? Yeah, yeah. I try to eat here when I can. You know, keeps me in touch with what's happening. I bet. It's probably a good way to stay connected with the kids. Yeah. Well, actually I was one of these kids. Really? Really. Yeah, I ended up turning my life around, developed this business, found some good luck. But uh, I'm telling you, a place like this, it would have made a big difference. Are you sure you're ok? Yeah, I'm... I'm good. You know, I'm gonna let you go ahead and get back to your lunch. I just wanted to come down here and say thank you for helping me out the other day. Yeah, no problem. Yeah. Uh, let me know if you hear of any leads from the TV appearance. Yeah, I will. Definitely. Any time. Throw these in the ocean somewhere. Make sure they disappear. Get dressed. Today's your big day. What's gonna happen to me? Depends on you. Cooperate, things could really be ok. Be difficult, you and your judge mom might not end up so ok. Ten minutes. Let's speed things up a bit. Just make sure we're on schedule. Annalise. I'm sorry, I'm interrupting. Uh, no. We just had a shipment going out and we had some paperwork and other things, but is... is everything ok? Actually, I came down here to warn you. I wanted to tell you earlier, but I didn't know how. Warn me? I heard something and it concerns me. I think that they're on the wrong trail, and I think they're gonna miss finding her. Well, what did you hear? Actually, John, that you were involved. Me? After all I've done? I know. That's what I said. Well, you don't believe them, do you? Of course not. Good. Look, I... I probably shouldn't have even come down here. I just... I wanted you to know that you should be careful. Yeah, uh... I will. Thank you for telling me, and thank you for believing in me. Be careful. That sounds great. Yeah, that's correct. No, it's-we got it straight from intel. Yeah, we're sure he's moving 'em out tonight but we don't know how. Ok. I'll call you back. No, no, it's ok. It's ok. Thank you. Oh my god. Unbelievable. What? I just left Gallant. Something isn't right. He is lying to me and I think he knows where Carly is. I told you to stay out of this, Annalise. You're putting Carly at risk. I gotta go. No! He said that there's a shipment- I heard him say that there's a shipment going out tonight, alright? I can't just sit around. You're getting in the way of an active investigation. You're a judge. You know better. Back off this. You're kidding me? You-youth shelter? You told me that Carly wasn't connected to these other girls. You-you knew? You knew that she could be taken like these other girls? You- What did you say to him? You knew? Annalise, what did you say to Gallant? What did you say to him? What did you say to him? Did you suspect Gallant before she went missing? You've known this whole time. You knew at my party? You sacrificed my daughter for your case? You heartless son of a- You're a judge. We need evidence and you know that. It's even harder because you're involved. You're a judge, she's your daughter, we have history. We are doing our jobs. Now back off. How could you be so cold? You just expect me to wait around while the bodies of these young girls pile up into the alleyway until the next one is Carly's? Ok, go home Annalise. No, you know what? All you care about is your case! You were always a cop first. I am a mother. And then a lawyer, and a judge. And I know exactly how the police work. No. Stop. Come on, come on, pick up, pick up. Yeah, it's Sutton. Gallant's been spooked. We gotta move. Now. Tonight. Donna speaking. Hey. It's me. Look, I hate to do this but I need your help. Hey. So did you bring it? I don't exactly know that you're in the right frame of mind to handle it. Use your brain, lawyer girl. Too much thinking. There's not enough time. What about the police? Oh, like the detective that lied to me? Yeah, maybe that one. Jeez. Seriously? Hey, you never know. Do you even know how to use this? Detective Sutton showed me once. It was his weird idea of being romantic. Are you sure about this? Like I said. It's a last resort. What're you gonna do? I have no idea. I need a moment. Of course. Take as much time as you need. I'm not giving up. Alright, let's get this thing going. I've got her. Take those ones to the container. They're leaving tonight. Come on. Come on. Nobody be late. I'll be at the second drop off point. Now go. Alright, let's go. Chelsea, you're coming with me. Come on, get in there. Come on, let's go. Come on. Mom! Carly! Mom, it's John Gallant! Don't trust him! We're in some warehouse- Carly! Ok. Ok. Relax. Relax, ok? She's worth too much. They're never gonna catch her. Let's go. Finish it off. The gas can's in the corner. We'll see you at the shipping dock. Annalise, the police are gonna find her. No, it's gonna be too late. Derek, listen, it's Annalise. I just heard Carly's voice but she got cut off. She's with Gallant. I'm going to the warehouse. Please call me. Annalise- Do you see him? Is that him? What're you doing? Carly's gotta be in there. I know it. Well, wait for the police. I have been waiting for the cops this entire time. Seriously? Wait here. Annalise. Annalise! Jesus. Hands up! Police! Annalise... Hands up! Annalise... Hands up higher. Woah. Holy, holy... Ok. Make sure he doesn't move? No worries there. Carly? Carly? No? Ok. Listen, don't be scared anymore, alright? The cops, they're coming. You're gonna be safe. Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah. I- I don't know anything, alright? I'm just the driver. I'm just a mother, alright? So you need to start talking. I've got a gun pointed to the back of your head. Pretty sure that I can make this look like self-defense considering I'm a judge and I have a witness to back me up. Tell me. Where did Gallant take my daughter? WHERE DID HE TAKE HER?!! Ok! She's at the waterfront. Just put the gun down, please. You got him 'til the cops get here? I got him. Go ahead. Go ahead. I got him. Don't try anything stupid. Don't you move. Don't you move. They're here. Good evening. Come on, sweetheart. This way. Gallant! Mom! It's over! Mom! Let her go! Let Carly go! Drop the gun, Annalise. We got the girls in the van, we got 'em. Drop the gun. Give me my daughter. I swear to god I'll kill her. Mom... I swear to you. Drop it! Ok. You're so stupid. Mom! I am so, so sorry! It's ok. I'm sorry. It's ok. It's ok. Are you ok? Are you ok? I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, ok? Ok. Mom's here, it's alright. It's ok. It's ok. Annalise, Carly, are you ok? Are you both ok? Yeah. I'm so sorry. It's ok. It's ok. I'm sorry, too. I'm sorry, too. I love you. Come on.
