Subtitles by explosiveskull You are so, so young, Jordyn. So full of life, with endless possibilities. I can't wait to see what fate has in store for you. And you are truly blessed to have such wonderful friends. My only regret is not having your mother here to see how you've turned out. She would have been proud. She was exactly your age when she passed. I know, Aunt Ruth. You remind me of that every single birthday. Let us all pray for blessings on... Can we not? Please? Just this once? Okay, Jordyn. Finish your wish. It is time. It is time. It is time. It is time. It is time! Aah! It is time! Shock advised. Status clear. Push to shock. Are you okay? Yeah, I think so. I can't help but feel like I did this to her. She's a ticking time bomb. If it wasn't this, it'd be something else. You know that. Hey, you're a grown-ass woman. You should do something for yourself, okay? I know, but did you see that look on her face? It was like she was someone else. It's over, okay? She's going to be all right. She can't even remember what happened. Believe me, that's for the better. What? What is it? Nothing. Jordyn? It sounds crazy, but I felt something. It's hard to explain, but I... I felt something change. I felt her. Do you want me to take you home? No, I'm all right. I should get back to work. Are you sure? Yeah. Do you want me to give you a ride? No, I'll walk. I need to clear my head. Jordyn. Jordyn. I was trying to bring the brain here to you, Dr. Sakurai, because it's imperative that it be destroyed. It's impervious to all poisons. If it's blown up, its cells will regenerate and multiply, and it'll still be alive. Those monsters, what do they look like? Do you know? Some I think look exactly like us. We are all going to be killed! I've been working with Dr. Coldtower's lab... Jordyn. You're shift was over a half-hour ago. John, you scared me half to death. Sorry. Not much of a life working our kind of hours, huh, John? Well, we all find a way to get through. Yeah, I guess. - See ya, John - All right. And I'm handing the kits on to you. I'm told... And then it's usually too late. Oh, I'm sorry, but we're closed now. You're going to have to come back tomorrow. Uh, we're closed now, and I couldn't even help you if I wanted to. The systems are all shut down. Jordyn. How do you know my name? John! John! John! There's someone else in here, John. She's gone. It's late. I gotta get out of here. Oh, let me walk you out. It's okay. It'll be okay. Surrender. Kym? ♪ List to me ♪ Well, you are here ♪ Of the man who stole my future wife ♪ ♪ Tra la la You are Satan's daughter! You are Satan's daughter! That's it. Get it, bitch. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Move that cunt. Yeah, come on. Get that pussy working. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's it, that's it, bitch. Yeah, you got it. Yeah. Come on. ♪ List to me while I tell you ♪ ♪ Of the Spaniard that blighted my life ♪ ♪ List to me while I tell you ♪ ♪ Of the man who stole my future wife ♪ Come home. Come home. Come home. Find someone else. She isn't ready. She isn't like you. This one is different. I will send you back to hell from whence you came. Who are you talking to? No one. I heard you talking to someone. I just do that sometimes. You dropped this in the hallway. Yes, I must have dropped it. Thank you. I want to tell you something. I think you're old enough to hear this now. You weren't orphaned the way everyone would like you to believe. Your mother abandoned you. She gave you up because she couldn't handle the fact that it would happen to you too. What are you talking about? My mother is dead, Ruth. I have the obituary. Listen to me, child. We all thought that if we could just pretend hard enough that it would change things. Change things? Change what, Ruth? Change the fact that you were always barren and loveless and that would somehow make up for the mother that I always needed? You know what I think? I think you killed her! And you locked me up in this prison so you wouldn't have to rot in here alone! You know The Sisters of Jesus didn't want you, and I didn't have a choice, did I? There is no God, Ruth! There's just you and those stupid fairy tales that you like to believe in! I can see it in you. Just like her. Your blood is damned. You can't escape it. It's your fate. I've been protecting you from you, and it's destroying me. There is something out there, and it won't be long now before it catches up with you. And what you don't know is that it's something you've been looking for. And it will find you whether you want to be found or not, just like your mother and your mother's mother before her. I can't protect you anymore. On your birthday, what did you wish for? What? Your birthday wish. What was it? The same thing I wish for every year: to find my real parents. It's natural for you to want to know where you came from. Go get the box next to my bed. There's something I want to show you. What? Go. I couldn't give you this until you were older. It was your mother's. I've kept it for you all these years. You know what I'm saying? You obviously don't. Jordyn, are you listening? Uh, Jordyn? Hey! I feel it getting closer and closer. I have thoughts and feelings that aren't mine, Kym. I wake up in strange places, and I can't even remember how I got there. I have thoughts and feelings that aren't mine, Kym. I wake up in strange places, and I can't even remember how I got there. Do you even know... what you're living with? You don't see it, do you? Even when it's staring at you... right in the face. This isn't funny anymore. Fuck, Jordyn! You have one new message. Saturday, 9:22 a.m. Hey, Jordyn, it's me. Where are you? You working late again? What the hell, girl? Hi, it's Messina. Just wondering what you're doing. Maybe you're already gone. Ahh! It's me. I want to get wasted! Where you at? I'm coming over. Bye. Jordyn, is that you? Aww. Don't be upset. We're roommates. We share things Hi. Hi. Um... Yeah. No, I'm fine. Um... I just want to talk, okay? I just want you to listen. Um, I'm really sorry about last night. I don't know what came over me, and I've just been thinking about it all day, and I just want to talk to you, and I'm sorry. No, you're my best friend. I don't... I'm sorry. Hello? Hello, Jordyn? Jordyn, hello? Fuck. Hello, sister. I like the upgrade. Too bad it's only temporary. For once, you're finally pretty. Someone has fallen apart. How many more shall I send you? Doesn't matter. It'll never be enough. You can't hide behind your Jesus forever, now, can you? Come out and play. Come out and play. Come out and play. Feel the rush of youth... forever. Take me. Take me. Take... me! Take me! Ruth, Ruth... No. No! John. John! Oh, my God. John. John! John, it's me. John, it's me! What happened? Who did this to you? It was you. No. No! Get it, bitch. There. Come on. Get that pussy working. Yeah. You got it. Yeah, yeah. Shut up! Jordyn! The blood's on your hands now. I thought you were leaving. What are you talking about? I just got here. Uh, no, you just left. Uh... Did you notice anything unusual about me when I was here earlier? Uh, no, nothing. - Everything all right? - Yeah, yeah. I was just wondering. Listen, I don't want you here when Kym's home and I'm not. Okay? I don't want you two alone when I'm not here. What are you talking about? You were here all night I'm not getting into this right now! I think I've done bad things. It's begun, hasn't it? It will start like this. The dreams. She will try to find a way in. Your fantasies, your fears, doubts, guilty pleasures. She will play you while you sleep and get to know you, get to like you. A way in. She will need something of yours. Clothing, a favorite piece of jewelry, a photo, something you're attached to. The thought, the memory, the feeling attached to that is her way into your consciousness, into your heart, and she will seal it with blood. This is where she starts to change. The other you. You will start to have very subtle run-ins with the other you, so subtle you won't even notice they're happening. This is a test. This is her testing you and your grip on reality. If she passes this phase, she can isolate you. Isolate you. She will cut you off from those closest to you. She will drive them from you. This will start very subtly. Friends seeing you out places and being ignored. Strangers coming up to you like they know you. Has this happened? Oh, God! This won't stop, Jordyn. She will get closer and closer. She will start crowding you out of your own life until she's standing where you are. The final phase. She will come to you in the form of another you and try to seduce you. She will know things about you that you don't even know. At this point... ...it's too late. I can feel her cold eyes reaching inside me, emptying me of myself. I am her... and she is me. I have to end this. I want you to know if you go down this road, there is no going back. Yes, yes, I understand. There is one thing I could try, but it is risky, and it could easily be reversed and turned against us if we're not careful. I don't care. I don't care. I want this to stop! I do know this. She is dying. She's been in her current state for far too long, and she's expiring. She is ready to shed her skin. She needs your physical body. You must use this against her. The transfer cannot take place unless you're willing. She has to be invited. This is when she's at her most vulnerable. During the transfer, it is possible to destroy her. Are you ready to begin? Yes. Yes, I'm ready. Close your eyes, child. Close... your... eyes. You need to go back. Back further. Go back into your mind and you will find her. Do you see? Do you see her? There! There she is. Follow her. Concentrate now. What do you see? Let go. Let go of yourself, Jordyn. Let me in. Let me bare the burden. Let go. Let go. Let go. Let go. Wake up, wake up, wake up. Ruth... I've got something to show you. Finish your wish. Finish your wish. Beauty, power. Beauty, power. Beauty, power. Beauty, power! It is time. It is time. It is... No! There you are. You've been holding out on me. You've been missing out, Donny. - Can I show you something? - Please. Is that the best you can do? Taking advantage of your poor daughter and her friends? I like it better when we keep it in the family. I liked your little trick earlier. I do my best. You know we can't keep doing this forever, now, can we? You keep on saying that, and then you keep on renewing every 50 years, now, don't you? Not this time. Oh, yes. So how is your Jesus treating you? You serve the light. You are no god. I don't need to be. Just don't get blinded by that light. Remember your true nature. Beauty and power, remember? Together forever, sister. To the end. All things come to an end. Someday you'll thank me for this. I'm only doing what you couldn't. And let me tell you, you loved... every minute of it. Who are you? I'm your waking dream, Jordyn, offering limitless... immortal consciousness. Give yourself to yourself Jordyn. Take my hand... ...and surrender. Surrender. Surrender. Don't be afraid, Jordyn. What did you do? It was all decided a long time ago, before you were born, before I was born. It is our blood destiny, our place in life. It is the will of the Unholy Father. But I watched you from afar, seeing you grow, wanting to be with you, but unable. Why did you leave me? You have no idea what you are, do you? Who are you? I am your dirty, damaged soul, pulling you back inside to devour you. Stay away from me! Ohh! Yes! The fear, the hatred. Ah, that's right. Yes! Stay out of my head! You're not my real mother! Now, that's no way to talk, Jordyn. You summoned me, remember? Be very careful of what you wish for. Each unguarded thought can be your worst enemy. And we had such high hopes for you, didn't we, Ruthie? What, you think I'm a witch? Yes, I'm a wicked, wicked witch, and I ride around on broomsticks, eating children while they sleep. Why don't we just... It's time. It is time! It is time! Unholy Father, for thee that has strayed, what is thy will? We can keep doing this forever, now, can't we? Beauty and power, sister. Together forever. Subtitles by explosiveskull ♪ Open your mind ♪ Open your mind ♪ Open your mind ♪ Open your mind ♪ Open ♪ Your ♪ Mind ♪ Open ♪ Your ♪ Mind
