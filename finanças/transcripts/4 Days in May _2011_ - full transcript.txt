The Russians are coming! I saw them fighting. In southern direction. The local party chief told me to observe the coast. Oh, did he say that? - Yes, he did. Your local party chief fled. The cowardly pig. Hans, give me one of your carbines. Get lost. Come on, bugger off! Hey, boy. You're from the manor, right? What about the Baroness and her children? - How many girls are still with you? - Not many. Tell the Baroness that our boat will be going to Denmark... ... as long as possible. That's the only chance for the girls. - They have to leave the island. - I'll take care of them. I've been looking for him everywhere. He's not here. Vera, read something to the children. Sing a song. Do something. Anything. Germans! Don't move! Don't move! We depart. Stop! Come here! Come here, I said! Come here, I said! - Peter! - Anna! Hide! - What are you doing? - The Russians are coming! Hide! I am an officer of the Red Army. Come out with your hands up! Ask her where the soldiers are hiding. Soldiers, fascists? Where? I understood you. This is a children's home. There are only women and girls. There are no soldiers. Send everyone out! Those who remain inside will be shot. I'm Baroness Maria von Lewenow. I vouch for this home. They are children who are afraid. Everyone get out! Vera, go get the girls. Get off the courtyard... Get off the courtyard! Go away! Go away! Don't shoot! Don't hurt him. He's not a soldier. He is my nephew. Are you alone? Check that again! I asked if you're alone? From which unit? He's a child. He is thirteen years old. A child! With a machine pistol? In a uniform? - I'm a soldier! - Shut up! - Say that again! - I am a soldier. - What did you say? - I am a soldier. From which regiment? 8th infantry regiment. - 8th infantry regiment? - You fascist tyke! Has he gained consciousness again? Bring him to the dragon. You will hold the line here, captain. At a children's home of all things? Did you hope to get to a brothel? This position is excellent. You'll see the Germans no matter where they come from. And then you arrest them. Got it? And this time, captain: No arbitrary acts, right? Then back me up this time! With artillery, infantry and tanks! What would you need backup for? Do you want to disobey me? - Do you want to end up in front of a tribunal again? - No, the last time was enough! Why do you want tanks then? This place is full of German troops. Since this morning, 9 o'clock, this coastal strip is under our control. For us the war is over, captain. Stay calm. Enjoy yourself! I insist on your support. I have seven men under my command, one of them is wounded. - Is he able to be transported? - No. Then he'll die as as hero. What are we supposed to do? Radio operator! Tell the headquarters our position. Square 52. We are staying here. Button up! - What about the prisoner? - See to it that he just gets toys. - Understood. - No arms! Rowan berry, this is birch tree. Rowan berry, this is birch tree. Take our coordinates. Where are the people who slept here? Answer me when I ask you something! They have left, captain. Where to? They have been picked up. Brought away. When the Red Army... the front came closer. Some had... relatives... So they remembered their orphans? Let's go. - Is that your room? - Yes. - How come you speak Russian? - My aunt taught me. She is from St. Petersburg. Do you have any more weapons? The father? Near Kursk... Is he alive? Is he alive? Then try to be smarter than him. The mother? Give it to me... Please, give it to me! No! Leave me alone! Comrade major, what are we supposed to do with the broken cannon? - We leave it here... - All right, we leave it here. Did you bring some booze? How are we supposed to shoot with this crap? - You are the infantry! You know how to deal with such things. We only have one shot. And the cannon is crap. Your home is confiscated. - We are watching the coast. - The war is over. - Only for you. - Captain, what about my employee that was taken by your people? My people? Who? Him? Or him? I don't know. But you know what will happen to the girl. I am an ordinary captain. I'm in command of seven men. They have survived the war and don't want to die now. That's the only thing I am responsible for. I am responsible for the women and children in this house. We have brought sixty orphans through the war safely. Are now there are only a few left, who have no one except for me. - They are free to leave. - We don't have anywhere to go. - What will happen to my nephew? - He will be treated as a prisoner of war? He has done nothing. He has fired at one of my soldiers. Come. Quiet, quiet. A rifle bullet. What did he have? - A machine pistol. Anna, it's me. Anna? They took Vera. I can watch them. You have to leave! As soon as possible. - Don't leave me alone! - I won't, I promise. Peter! I have to get some water. Comrade captain! Germans! At the beach! Judging from their uniforms, different branches of service. They haven't discovered us yet. - They are fleeing. - Damn. I am connected to the headquarters. Comrade captain, you didn't send the reinforcements. - Why not? - They want to know how many Germans there are. - Who's the commander? - The major. He says, at the earliest tomorrow. Son of a bitch... Rowan tree, here's birch tree. - Who is it? - Captain Kalmykow. The beach is full of Germans. I need tank support. You know that we are only eight men, one is wounded. Understood, comrade major. We have order to arrest them. Without tanks. They have ten times more men than we do. Five men with me. And bring the boy as translator - Cabbage, you stay here. - Yes! They have discovered us. Let's get out of hiding. Let's go. We'll talk to them, boy. Truba, Gramophone: to the right. Fedjunin, Sedych: to the left. The war is over. Surrender and he'll guarantee for your lifes. We have orders to gather here at the beach and cross over to Denmark, where we will lay down our weapons. We don't fight anymore. Whom do you want to surrender to? - The Americans? - The British... You have to surrender to us. How many of these idiots are there? I understood. Surrender and he'll guarantee for your lifes... I'm the only one in a position to guarantee anything. How many soldiers do you have? 20? Eight. Ask him, what for he wants to die now? You are all prisoners of war! He's crazy. I told you, we don't fight anymore and we will surrender to the English. You have twenty minutes to withdraw, or else we will attack. I understood. Go on. Why are we moving this thing? We only got one shot anyway, comrade captain. Only one. And that's why this shot is so decisive. - What's going on? - They are watching us. And we're watching them. - How far is it to the shore? - About 500 meters. Then make it 1200 to the boat. Fire! They're leaving. They're leaving. Lieutenant colonel! You should have a look at this. - The bastard... - What is he doing? Don't you see that? It's his insurance. Lieutenant colonel, there are eight soldiers. With artillery, in a house full of children. Is there any other place where we can get onto the boat? There's supposed to be one four kilometers south of here, but there are Russians as well. The Russians are everywhere. Gosh, Wendt! We have to get away from here. You have to stay here for another night. There are soldiers at the beach. They will rescue us. So it's a girl who you are fighting for. I like that. Come down now! I didn't know where she was. The girl belongs to us. She's working here. - Are there any more surprises? Do we have to search everything? - No. If this is a children's home, then I am Santa Claus! - Don't think even think about it, soldier! - I'm not thinking anything at all. Don't you have anything to do? Get out of here! Sit down! What are you doing? They need help. I imagine my kids being in this situation. Yeah! That sucks. Lieutenant colonel, may I speak frankly? Why don't we attack? How do you want to do that, Wendt? I could still assemble 8 to 10 groups, nearly 100 men, who are able to fight. With all due respect, lieutenant colonel, we are still part of the army. Two hours, when the boat arrives, two hours. And live... Come, Lord Jesus, be our guest, and bless what you gave us. Amen. Enjoy your meal! Quick! To your position! Who has cut her hair? She looks like a boy. Hey, my beauty! What happened? You look like a boy. Look at me. Don't be afraid. I like it. That's our girl... please let her go! Let her go. Sergeant, fetch me some water! I'm thirsty. - Sit down with us and eat. - Thank you, I've already eaten. That's an order. The girl is mine. And you are eating now! Eat! So that you don't run off at night. Got it? Why do you call the captain "dragon"? Because his head was cut off twice but it always grew back. Comrade sergeant, you're new and perhaps you didn't get it yet: For us dragon is commander, father and brother in one person. That's why we have a rule: If the captain gives an order or asks for something, then we do it: quickly and accurately. That's the best for everyone. To hell with your rules! After the war, the scores will be settled. Shut up and be careful what you say. Dragon has paid enough already. He lost his wife, his daughter and his son. So you better be quiet! Ring the bell if you need something. Hey, Truba! What will you do first when you come home after the war? I go to a restaurant and order 150 grams of vodka. With a beer and lightly salted cucumbers... They aren't available at this time of the year. They will be at the time when we get home. Afterwards, a fish solyanka... ... a steak with eggs... And then I'll go for a walk in the park with my wife. A walk in the park? Don't you have anything better to do? Have you ever met his wife? Vova, you're young and inexperienced, but I'll explain it to you. - A true connoisseur... - Are you impotent? What does this have to do with impotence? Every connoisseur knows... We have always told him, he was the man of the house. He was the only man in the house. But he's not a man. Baroness... Where are the Germans? Read! Read! Your people did this. - I don't want to. - Come on, come on! Go! Go on! Take the bag and go! Turn on some music. What are you looking at? Turn on some music. Come in. - I need something from my room. - Please. - You can borrow it if you like. - Another time. - We could patch your people's uniforms. - What for? You didn't do us any harm. Thank you, that's not necessary. I think it's necessary. We could wash them as well. Thank you, that's necessary. Where are you from? From Leningrad, like you. I'm from St. Petersburg. Never mind. - We used to live at the Fontanka River. - And we lived on Nevsky Prospect. - What is St. Petersburg like these days? - It lies in ruins. - Berlin, Dresden and Hamburg as well. - Are you blaming me for this? No, but you won't be able to convince me of your ideas. During the revolution, my father fought against you and lost. And he didn't start it either. Do you have further questions? Go ahead, I'll answer them all at once. I have no further questions, captain. But a request: Bring me back the woman. - Faster, faster! - Come on, boy! Collect them! There are some more behind you. - Behind you! - Here comes another one! - What's going on? - We're fishing, captain! It will make the boy tougher. - Get him out! - I can't swim, captain. - Then you go. - I can't either. Have you lost your mind? - I'll send this to you after the war. - I shot at your soldier. It's a shame that I missed him. Interesting, soldier. Then please explain to us: How do you get a rifle bullet into a machine pistol? I shot anyway! You remind me of my son when he was twelve. Short-haired! Look! Wounded twice. Twice I recovered. A body made of steel. Allow me to introduce myself: Sergej Iwanov. But for you simply... Shush, the dragon! Hide the bottle! Get up! If our people catch you like this, you'll end up in prisoner-of-war camp. - Let me go! - And in shorts you'll look... Give me a hand! ... like a real boy. Don't worry, boy, you'll get really fancy pants! Faster, faster. Look! - Is the fish done? - Yes. What are you doing here? The D was the most beautiful. Tell him that! She said you played bad. No, this is Tchaikovsky: The variations for out-of-tune pianos! Ask him if he is a famous musician. Please! She wants to know if all Russian musicians play that bad. Did she say that? Yes. No, just me. I studied at the Conservatory. Before the war. And after the war? Oh, I would have been kicked out anyway. I wasn't good enough. He wasn't good enough. I think he plays brilliantly. I can play some German pieces. Let's go. I can take care of myself. - You'll still need me. - But not now, go play! Schumann, Mahler, Brahms. I play Schumann. I love his music. But I hate his country. German uniforms burn well. Unlike ours that glow forever. I'm from the children's home. I need to speak to the commander. Please, it's important. No missiles... The gun doesn't work properly and they have no ammunition. - Why should I believe you, boy? - You must believe me, please. Did you send out the light signals yesterday? What are they planning? The captain requested reinforcement, but they didn't get it. They are only 8 men. - One is injured, so you could... - That captain... What is he like? They call him dragon. He is... I don't know. - What do you mean? - What are his plans? His soldiers say, their captain won't sacrifice them. The war is over and he knows it just as well as we do. What about the children? I might be able to help you, lieutenant colonel. If you let me know when you'll be attacking. If you rescue us, then I'll bring the children to safety. Your message was important, boy. Good job. We will inform you. Don't get caught. Wendt? Tell the boat to come. Where does the boat come from? I told you: watch the beach round the clock! - How could this happen - They have scouts as well. Let them get away, if our command doesn't care. - So? - No connection, comrade captain. Our order is: Prevent them from escaping and arrest them. Two men take care of the boat. I'll decide who will go. What's going on? Why don't they rescue you? Why aren't they doing anything? I told you to answer me if I ask you something. And if I don't know the answer? I wonder what I would have done in your place. To tell them that the enemy has no ammunition would be brave! On the other hand... Eighty against eight? They are cowards. Because they want to live? Because they don't fight. I am the enemy. Kill me! Kill me! Those at the beach are cowards. You're not a coward! Kill! Can you tell me about the war? - What do you want to know? - Everything. - For example? - What was your most heroic deed? I was a teacher at a school in Leningrad. There was a boy in my class, Serjoscha. He was weak and sheepish. He was like his mother. He read a lot. When the war began, this bookworm declared that he wanted to become a soldier. His father laughed at him. But Serjoscha, who had always dreamed of becoming a doctor, became a soldier. And he fell in the war... On his second deployment. If he had become a doctor... he would have been able to help people like him. He would have been a hero. But now? A dead hero? He was your son. Your son... Your son fell in the war. A father cannot influence the fate of his son. The sons always decide for themselves. Are you coming? Swimming? Come on! Turn around! Do you still like me? The pianist... what is he like? What do I know? A Bolshevik. A musician. He's got hair in his ears and in the nose. He is a soldier. What do you want from him? He's a man. You are not! Hey, boy. What was going on yesterday? They destroyed out boat. You should have warned us! Why didn't you say anything? Why didn't you attack? Get lost! Come on, get lost! - They'll be home before we will. - The Germans? The Birds. I see... How far are they with the boat? Maybe they'll get it done tomorrow. - Tomorrow is good. - Who cut off his head? - Whose head? The dragon's. The dragon's? The dragon is an honest, decent man. Such people usually have many enemies: Political officials... At the beginning of the war he was a platoon leader. He was surrounded, broke the enemy lines... and was sent to the penal battalion. When he was a major again, he got into a fight with the regimental commander. He was drunk. Our captain defended his men. Serjoscha and I were there. And again the penal battalion. Then he got injured... He has literally paid with his blood. That's how it is, boy. Live and learn. Just look at our radio operator! This Fedjunin! He doesn't waste any time. Not bad for the greenhorn. He doesn't sleep. He's faster than us. Anna? - Soldier Fedjunin! - Present. Do you know how rape is punished in our army? There was no rape. This wasn't my question. How does the army deal with rapists? I know that. - May I ask for something? - Go ahead! Talk to the girl. I love her. Tell that to the military judge. Until the military court decides about your case, you are under arrest. Private! Trubizin! March him off. Please talk to the girl! You left your position against my order. March him off. Yes! - Where? - To the basement. - What's the point of that, dragon? - Only in the pub, I'm "dragon"! Can I have some more bread? I've got to talk to you. Immediately. Aunt, I'm eating! You'll go to the captain and resolve this. She told me that she was together with him voluntarily, which is bad enough! Go to the captain yourself, if you want to tell him something. Go to your room! What do you think, will the Germans surrender? Take it! Who knows when the post will be operating again? He shouldn't be hanged. What? He shouldn't be hanged. She was together with him voluntarily. The bitch! Mutiny on board? What about the enemy? Everything's fine with the enemy. They're waiting for better times. Like us. Sergeant Sedych, to your position! Move. Yes! - May I go? - Yes. Stand at ease. - Line up in five minutes. - Yes, comrade captain. ... thy kingdom come, thy will be done... Congratulations on the victory, men! Fedjunin! Let's drink to the captain! Sanja! Come join us! Comrades, this long-awaited day will be over soon and never come back. I want us to cherish this moment. We take a picture! - You've got no camera! - Here is my camera! I'll use this to take the picture. And we will record it here and here. - Comrade major, finally! - Comrade captain. Are you all right? Still alive and kicking? - The Germans are still at the beach. - Nevermind. May I join you? Comrade major, where are your tanks? We've been trying to contact you for the last three days. The war is over! To victory! Food! Music! - Attention! - Stand at ease! You're celebrating? Very nice. Congratulations to victory! You've been lucky with this house, captain. Enviable. - Introduce me to the ladies, please! - Another time. Now. Now! Please bring the children to their rooms. I see you've made friends with the Germans. Are you sure that this corresponds to your goals, captain? Let's capture the German soldiers. Do not change the subject. The whole island is full of old women, and you sit right here in the nest. Share with your comrades! Comrade major, you are drunk. - So what? - Sleep it off! Tomorrow we'll talk about this. Don't talk to me like that, captain! Bring the short-haired one down here! Immediately! Radio operator, please notify headquarters that we have a problem. Problems! You're going to get some soon. Leave the house! Now they'll cut off his head for the third time. Tell your people on the beach that we'll send over the girls and women. Follow me! The Red Army will teach these defectors a lesson. I am a commander of the Red Army. With seven Red Army soldiers. We are a reconnaissance unit. Are you crazy? Do not shoot! Do you want to fight against us? Spread out! We have orders to guard the house. There are women and children inside! Where are the children? - In the basement. Sinizin! It's me, Sergej Iwanov. Do not shoot! Spread out! The machine gun! - Are you sure, Pasha? - Only as a deterrent. Men... Sascha... I can't give you an order. You must decide for yourselves. Everyone who wants to leave is free to go. Now! I'm going home, men. Who else? We'll stay with you, Pasha. Until the end. Hello? Can anybody hear me? Hello? Hello? "... Now stop the howling, or else I'll whine like a child..." Aim above their heads! Fire! What's going on? The Russians are attacking us! The major wants to take revenge on the captain. Help us. Boy, who is fighting over there? An armored unit of the Russians against their own people. Are the children inside the house? Help us, please! You've got enough men! Please! We don't stand a chance without tanks. They have machine guns! Lieutenant, call for tank support immediately! - Yes. - These assholes! They are pulling back, captain! The Germans! Why are you here? He said they would fight with you. - Pasha! - Serjoscha, no. Take it easy! Do not shoot! How many attackers are there? - What? - How many attackers are there? Bring the boy to the basement! Let go of me! I'm sorry, boy. It's for your own good. Let me out! Live, little Peter! Come here! Come here! Come on! Get out of here before the Russians come back!
