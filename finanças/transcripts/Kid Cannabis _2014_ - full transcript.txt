BEAUTIFUL. ISN'T IT? BUT LISTEN. YOU HEAR IT? I HEAR IT IN MY NIGHTMARES. THAT'S THE SOUND OF THE FEDS, WORKING THEIR UNMANNED DRONES, SPENDING MORE MONEY TRYING TO SHUT US DOWN THAN THEY DID SEARCHING FOR OSAMA BIN LADEN. 42 BILLION SPENT IN THE WAR ON POT. 140 BUCKS FROM EVERY ONE OF YOU TO FIGHT A LITTLE GREEN HERB MADE BY GOD THAT GROWS IN THE SUN. AND GOD DOESN'T MAKE MISTAKES. GO! GO GO GO! I WOULD HAVE PERSONALLY PAID 18 MILLION IN TAXES ON THE ALMOST 6O MILLION I MADE FROM THE MEDICINE I SOLD. BUT THEY NEVER ASKED, SO I NEVER OFFERED. I NEVER GOT THE BILL, SO I DIDN'T PAY. HERE'S THE SKINNY. I WAS A SPONGY KID FROM THE WRONG SIDE OF THE LAKE. A HIGH SCHOOL DROPOUT. THE LOST CAUSE. THE INVISIBLE KID WHOSE NAME YOU FORGET BEFORE I EVEN FINISH SAYING IT. BUT I RAN A DISCIPLINED, $68 MILLION A YEAR BUSINESS AND EMPLOYED HUNDREDS OF WAL-MART-SHOPPING, EXXON-BUYING AMERICANS. AND WE'D STILL BE UP AND RUNNING, TRYING TO COPE WITH THE DEMAND, IF MURDER AND MAYHEM HADN'T ENTERED THE PICTURE. BUT HEY, YOU CAN'T PUT THE TOOTHPASTE BACK IN THE TUBE, CAN YOU? TOPHER MOVED TO IDAHO FROM BOSTON WHEN HE WAS 15. HE TOOK A LOT OF SHIT FOR HIS BOSTON ACCENT AND FOR BEING FULL OF SHIT. BUT HE'S HAD MY BACK EVER SINCE HE BEAT DOWN BILLY "THE BULL" TURROW, WHO USED TO GIVE ME A DAILY THUMPING FOR AS LONG AS I CAN REMEMBER. WE HAD ONE BIG THING IN COMMON. POT. TALKING ABOUT IT, SMOKING IT, LOOKING FOR MORE, BETTER, CHEAPER. YOU KNOW THE DEAL. HE LIKED GETTING HIGH ALMOST AS MUCH AS I DID, AND THAT IS SAYING A LOT. YOU CAN'T BELIEVE HALF THE SHIT THAT COMES OUT OF HIS MOUTH, BUT TOPHER HAD GAME. HE'D GET ME TO DO THINGS I WOULD HAVE NEVER DONE ON MY OWN. HE WAS MY BEST FRO. WHAT'S UP, MOTHERFUCKERS? IS THIS A PARTY? IF I COULD ERASE ONE GUY FROM THIS STORY, IT WOULD BE BRENDAN BUTLER. HE LOST THE PLOT YEARS AGO. WENT TO SLEEP ON THE DIRT FLOOR OF A KOREAN ORPHANAGE, WOKE UP IN A MANSION IN COEUR D'ALENE LAKE WITH A SILVER SPOON UP HIS ASS. BUT NO GOOD DEED GOES UNPUNISHED. HE PAID HIS ADOPTED DADDY WARBUCKS BACK BY BECOMING THE BIGGEST, BADDEST, LOUDEST DRUG DEALER IN TOWN. DEALT HIS OVERPRICED WEED TO THE FRAT PACK AT GONZAGA PREP. US PUBLIC SCHOOL KIDS GOT THE STICKS AND SEEDS. PEOPLE TALK ABOUT HIM BEING AN HONORS STUDENT, PERFECT S.A.T. SCORES. BUT HE DID SOME OF THE STUPIDEST SHIT I'D EVER SEEN. HE WAS ALWAYS TALKING WHEN HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN LISTENING. DO YOU THINK PEOPLE WILL KNOW WHAT I AM? WHO CARES? THE CHICKS WILL HAVE TO ASK, RIGHT? FOOT IN THE DOOR, DICK IN THE WHORE. JUST LET ME DO THE TALKING. I'LL GET US IN. - ALL RIGHT. - NATE? IS THAT YOU? - HEY, ASHLI WITH AN "I." - IT'S ME. HOW ARE YOU? I'M GREAT. WHAT ARE YOU?

SERIOUSLY, THE PIZZA I USED TO DELIVER'S KILLED MORE PEOPLE THAN ALL THE WEED EVER SMOKED IN THE STATE OF IDAHO. - MOM AWAKE? - I DON'T KNOW. - YOU DO YOUR HOMEWORK? - YEAH. - YOU REALLY DO YOUR HOMEWORK? - YEAH.

WHATEVER YOU DO, DON'T TOUCH THOSE YELLOW THINGS. - WHY NOT? - WHOLE PLACE WILL BLOW UP. REALLY? - NO. - THEY'RE FLY TRAPS. I HAVE BEEN SELECTING INDICA MOTHERS AND CROSS-BREEDING THEM WITH MOSTLY INDICA MALE PLANTS. AND THIS, OH, THIS IS MY MASTERPIECE. TOOK ME ALMOST 2O YEARS TO DEVELOP THIS STRAIN. THE HOMOZYGOUS DOMINANT IS WHAT GETS THE GREAT BUD COLOR. THIS DURGA MATA, SHE'S A HYBRID OF TWO DIFFERENT SHIVA STRAINS. I GET ONE FROM A U.S. GOVERNMENT LABORATORY.

MANATUSHKA THUNDERFUCK AND SILVER KUSH, SEE, CAN'T EVEN CARRY THIS BUD'S JOCKSTRAP. IT'S TWO DIFFERENT UNIVERSES. THEY'RE NOT EVEN IN THE FUCKING SAME REALITY. LOOK AT ME. THE SHIT THAT WE GROW HERE IS FUCKING INSANE. THIS IS THE HEALTHIEST THC DELIVERY SYSTEM THAT YOU CAN USE. YOU UNDERSTAND, IT DOESN'T BURN THE LEAVES, IT JUST HEATS THEM UP ENOUGH TO RELEASE AND ACTIVATE THE THC. SO, IT FEELS LIKE YOU'RE INHALING COOL AIR, WITH A LIGHT KIND OF CANDY CORN TASTE. TRUST ME, WHEN YOU SMOKE AS MUCH AS WE DO, IT'S THE ONLY WAY TO GO. YEAH. I MEAN, YOUR LUNGS ARE THE GATEWAY TO THE BLOODSTREAM, AND THEY HAVE TO LAST YOU A LIFETIME. JOHN USED TO BE A TWO PACK A DAY SMOKER - WHEN WE MET. - YOU ARE A GODDESS, AND YOU SAVED MY LIFE. OF COURSE, BABY. YOU BOYS DON'T SMOKE CIGARETTES, DO YOU? - HE DOES. - THAT'S A NASTY HABIT.

WE DON'T DEAL IN SMALL QUANTITY. NOTHING LESS THAN A HUNDRED A RUN, $1600 A POUND. TRUST ME, IT'S IN BOTH OF OUR BEST INTERESTS. YOU'RE GONNA WANT TO KEEP YOUR RISK-REWARD RATIO NICE AND HIGH. CAN YOU DEAL WITH THAT KIND OF STOCK? REMEMBERING THAT EFFECTIVE DISTRIBUTION IS THE KEY TO SUCCESS FOR ALL OF US IN THIS BUSINESS. THE ONLY SURE THING IS THE DEMAND. THE REST OF IT IS JUST PLAIN, OLD-FASHIONED HARD WORK. YOU'RE PREACHING AGAIN. NO. BUT, HONEY, THIS IS IMPORTANT. AND LET ME TELL THEM WHY. BECAUSE WHEN THE MONEY COMES, WHEN IT REALLY, REALLY STARTS TO COME, WELL, SOMETIMES, BOYS, IT IS HARD TO KEEP YOUR GO KART ON THE TRACK. ACTUALLY, WE WERE THINKING MORE LIKE 300 POUNDS. EXCUSE ME? CAN YOU GET THAT MANY ABLE BODIES? SERIOUS SOLDIERS WITH SOFT, GOLDEN HEARTS? - IT'S NOT A PROBLEM. - PEOPLE WHO YOU WOULD BLIND TRUST - IN A FOREST FIRE OR FIREFIGHT. - ONE HUNDRED PERCENT. THESE ARE GUYS I GREW UP WITH. THEY'RE MY BROTHERS BUT FROM DIFFERENT MOTHERS. WELL, LET'S GET DOWN TO BRASS TACKS. DRUG SMUGGLING-- YES. THAT DAMN SURE IS WHAT IT lS-- REQUIRES MORE COOL, MORE INTEGRITY THAN ANY OTHER BUSINESS. SO MUCH IS DONE ON A WINK AND A HANDSHAKE. AND IF YOU DID GET BUSTED, IT'S USUALLY BECAUSE SOMEBODY WAS JEALOUS. THEY RATTED YOU OUT. SOMEONE ON THE INSIDE. SOMEONE ON YOUR FIRST-STRING TEAM, ALL FULL OF BEER AND BULLSHIT, WHO HAS NO IDEA WHAT COOL REALLY MEANS. CLINT EASTWOOD. CLINT EASTWOOD IS COOL.

THANK GOD TOPHER WAS TOO DUMB TO SLOP ON THE ONE CONDOM HE BROUGHT, BECAUSE I NEEDED IT TO GET THE SAMPLE WEED BACK ACROSS THE BORDER.

HE BROUGHT ECSTASY IN FROM THE COAST OF PORTUGAL, COCAINE FROM SOUTH PERU, AND FUNNELED MONEY FROM THE STREETS OF THE NORTHWEST INTO HIS ACCOUNTS. BUT HIS REAL LOVE AND PASSION WAS WEED.

HARRIS'S HISTORY CLASS. I KNOW YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE YOUR MOTHER NOT HAVE TO REFILL COFFEE FOR A LIVING. - YEAH. - DO YOU UNDERSTAND HOW EASY IT WOULD BE TO BURY 170 POUNDS OF ROTTING MEAT WHERE NO ONE WILL EVER FIND IT?

BECAUSE WE HOLD EACH OTHER'S FUTURES IN OUR HANDS. UNITED WE STAND, DIVIDED WE FALL. AND IF WE FALL, IT'S BECAUSE SOMEONE'S TALKING WHEN THEY SHOULD BE LISTENING. SOMEONE WHO HAS NO IDEA WHAT THE CONCEPT OF COOL IS. CLINT EASTWOOD IS COOL. TWELVE TO TWENTY WORDS A PICTURE, DOESN'T NEED TO BRAG, DOESN'T NEED TO BOAST, JUST GETS SHIT DONE.

IF YOUR PHONE'S ON, THE FEDS CAN TRACE YOU ABSOLUTELY ANYWHERE. WE MAINTAIN ABSOLUTE SILENCE. IF WE TRIP OFF THE MOTION SENSORS, THEY'LL BE LISTENING TO US WITH HIDDEN MIKES. YOU CLOSE EVERY GATE YOU OPEN, YOU PACK OUT WHAT YOU PACK IN. DON'T EVEN SPIT UNLESS YOU HAVE TO. SERIOUSLY, THE LAST THING WE WANT TO DO IS PISS OFF ONE OF THESE SURVIVALIST REDNECK TYPES LIVING IN THESE WOODS. IT'LL BE 16.3 MILES ACROSS THE TRAIL.

BUT LIKE EVERYONE ELSE, AS LONG AS THEY WERE PROFITING IN A FAT WAY, NO ONE WANTED TO KNOW WHERE THE BAGS OF CASH WERE REALLY COMING FROM. THE NEXT SIX MONTHS WERE A GREEN AND BUBBLY BLUR. ALL WE WERE DOING WAS RUNNING THROUGH THE WOODS, AND WE WERE CLEARING A MILLION A WEEK. AND TOPHER WAS STILL SAMPLING THE BUDS EVERY TIME HE WENT OVER FOR A PICKUP. THE GREFARDS WERE SUPPLYING THE HIGHEST-QUALITY PRODUCT ANYONE HAD EVER SEEN. WE HAD AN APARTMENT IN SPOKANE THAT WE USED FOR THE DROPOFFS. AT FIRST IT WAS ONCE A WEEK. THEN THREE TIMES A WEEK. THEN EVERY DAY OF THE WEEK. AND ALL OF OUR LIFESTYLES WERE TAKING A SERIOUS UPGRADE. I FINALLY GOT A LEGIT EYE EXAM. WITH THE RIGHT PRESCRIPTION, THE WORLD WAS STARTING TO LOOK A WHOLE LOT BETTER. I'M NOT SAYING WHERE. BUT I PUT A NICE CHUNK OF MY PROFIT AWAY FOR A RAINY DAY. MY OWN LITTLE 401(K). TOPHER AND I EVEN JOINED A GYM. GOT MYSELF A HOT TRAINER AND WAS WELL ON MY WAY TO LOSING 5O POUNDS OF PEPPERONI PIZZA BABY FAT. EVERYONE WAS HAPPY. PRICES WERE GOING DOWN. AND QUALITY UP. EVERYONE WANTED A PIECE OF THE PIE. WE HAD THE BEST-LOOKING GIRLS IN TOWN IN PAIRS. GIRLS THAT WOULDN'T'VE LOOKED IN OUR DIRECTION NOW WERE SUCKING ON THE BIG BONG. WE WERE WORKING HARD AND PLAYING EVEN HARDER.

YOU'LL GET YOUR TRIPLE PAY JUST THIS ONCE, OKAY? I MEAN, I'M NOT GONNA BE MAKING ANYTHING, BUT THAT'S OKAY. I WANT YOU GUYS TO BE HAPPY. I WANT YOU GUYS TO BE SAFE. YOU'RE NOT JUST MY EMPLOYEES. YOU'RE MY BEST FRIENDS. I LOVE YOU GUYS. SO, YEAH. THIS TIME I'LL DO IT. OKAY? WE COOL? JUST FIND ANOTHER ROUTE, PLEASE? BE SAFE? WE'RE GONNA BE GLOCKED AND COCKED FROM NOW ON. I DID GIVE THEM TRIPLE PAY FOR THAT RUN. AND THEY ALL SHOWED UP FOR MY BIRTHDAY BASH. TAKING FULL ADVANTAGE OF MY HOSPITALITY. LOOKING BACK, I PROBABLY SHOULD'VE REINED THINGS IN EARLIER. BUT HOW DO YOU KEEP KIDS LIKE THIS-- SANTA'S BROKEN TOYS FROM BROKEN HOMES AND ALMOST ALWAYS BROKE-- FROM CELEBRATING THEIR SUCCESS?

BUT I NEVER FOOLED MYSELF INTO THINKING I WAS GETTING BABES BECAUSE OF MY LOOKS OR MY THUMB SIZE AND CURVED DICK. I'D LIKE TO THINK THEY WOULD'VE COME BACK FOR SECONDS EVEN IF I WENT BACK TO DELIVERING PIZZAS. I'D LIKE TO THINK THAT, BUT I WAS STONED AND DELUSIONAL, TO BE HONEST.

YOU'RE FACING LIFE SENTENCES WITH NO POSSIBILITY OF PAROLE. TAKE A GOOD LOOK AT MY TITS, BOYS. 'CAUSE IF YOU DON'T COOPERATE, THEY'RE THE LAST PAIR YOU'RE EVER GOING TO SEE. I ONLY HAVE A FEW "GET OUT OF JAIL EARLY" CARDS. SO FIRST COME, FIRST SERVED. I WANT TO KNOW WHO THE GUY WAS AT THE TOP. WHO PULLED THE STRINGS. WHO RAN THE SHOW. NATE NORMAN. YEAH, IT WAS FUCKIN' NATE. NATE NORMAN. NATE GAVE ALL THE ORDERS. AND WE JUST WENT WHERE HE TOLD US TO GO. NATE NEVER TOLD US WHAT WAS IN THE BAGS. WE HAD NO IDEA. NATE HAD ALL OF THE CONNECTIONS. NATE KEPT ALL THE MONEY. NATE SUPPLIED THE FINANCING. WE DIDN'T SEE SHIT. NATE TOLD ME IF I LEFT, HE'D KILL MY FAMILY. NATE HAD BRENDAN BUTLER KILLED. I'M PRETTY SURE HE DID. THAT'S WHAT I HEARD.

WHERE'S NATE? NATE NORMAN? I DON'T KNOW! WHILE I WAS HIDING UP IN CANADA, MOVING ALONG THE UNDERGROUND RAILWAY, THE FEDS WERE DOING EVERY SLEAZY THING THEY COULD TO TRY TO GET ME BACK IN THEIR JURISDICTION. THAT'S WHAT THE LAWYER SAYS, MOM. YOU COULD DO TEN YEARS FOR MONEY LAUNDERING IF I DON'T TURN MYSELF IN. STICK IT TO PHILLIP IF THEY CAN'T GET TO ME. YOU JUST STAY WHERE YOU ARE, BABY. THEY'RE JUST TRYING TO SQUEEZE US TO GET TO YOU. I JUST... I JUST DON'T WANT YOU GUYS TO GET INTO ANY MORE TROUBLE BECAUSE OF ME. BABY, THEY WANT TO PUT YOU IN JAIL FOR THE REST OF YOUR GOD-GIVEN LIFE. THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT A GOOD BOY YOU ARE. THAT-- THAT YOU SHOVELED MRS. ROLAND'S DRIVEWAY EVERY TIME THE SNOW PLOW BLOCKED IT IN, AND YOU NEVER ONCE ASKED HER FOR A WOODEN NICKEL. YOU STAY WHERE YOU ARE. OKAY? LOVE YOU, MOM. I'M SORRY. DON'T BE SORRY, HONEY. IT'S JUST POT. IT'S JUST POT. WELCOME BACK, MR. NORMAN. THERE'S SOME PEOPLE WAITING FOR YOU. I COULD HAVE STAYED UP IN CANADA AND HAD A SEMI-SWEET LIFE, BUT I COULDN'T RISK MOM DOING ONE DAY IN THE BIG HOUSE. I THOUGHT I WOULD MISS THE CARS, THE HOUSES, THE GIRLS, BUT I REALIZED IT WAS NEVER REALLY ABOUT THE MONEY. IT WAS ABOUT THE THRILL OF THE CHASE. GOOD EVENING, MR. NORMAN. THANK YOU FOR COMING BACK. LEAVE THE KEY IN THE IGNITION. YOU WON'T BE NEEDING THOSE ANYMORE. HEY, I'M NOT SAYING IT WASN'T NICE SWOOPING DOWN AND SLIPPING TEN GRAND IN YOUR BEST FRIEND'S POCKET, - FOR A HARD DAY'S WORK, HAULING HEMP. - JIM. AND GUY, WHOSE ONLY OTHER OPTION WAS A NAMETAG AND $4.25 AN HOUR. BUT GRATITUDE AND LOYALTY ARE THE FIRST THINGS TO RUN FOR COVER WHEN YOU'RE FACING TEN YEARS, BUSTING ROCKS AND DODGING COCKS. YOU KNOW, FOR THE RECORD, I WOULD'VE GIVEN UP A KIDNEY FOR TOPHER. SO WHEN I GOT ROLLED ON AND SOLD ON, I REALLY HURT RIGHT DOWN TO THE MARROW. BUT HE HAS TO LIVE WITH WHAT HE DID. KARMA'S A BITCH. I GOT ANOTHER DIME TO DO AT THE "I FUCKED UP BIG TIME" FRAT HOUSE, BUT I'VE GOT A SOLID CELL-IATE, WHO'S GOT A GREAT IDEA FOR A MONEY-MAKING VENTURE THAT'S GUARANTEED TO-- I SHOULD PROBABLY JUST KEEP MY MOUTH SHUT. BUT YOU'LL LEARN A LOT IN PRISON, IF YOU KEEP YOUR HEAD DOWN AND YOUR EARS OPEN. I'M NOT SAYING IT'S THE GREATEST THING THAT'S EVER HAPPENED TO ME, BUT I'M MAKING THE BEST OF IT. THAT'S ALL YOU CAN DO. PLAY FROM WHERE THE MAN SPOTS THE BALL. MAKE THE MOST OF THE OPPORTUNITIES LIFE PUTS IN FRONT OF YOU. AND GET A GOOD LAWYER. BECAUSE MINE SUCKED.
