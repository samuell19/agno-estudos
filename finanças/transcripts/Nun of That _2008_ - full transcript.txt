- Whoo! - Man, the food here got lots better when they took Vinny's momma off the stage and put her in the kitchen. - Yeah, but I'm gonna miss her. These new girls they ain't got no tits. - Mom, I see the menu hasn't changed. You'll spoil your appetite. This is. How can we sit here and eat when three of our boys have been killed in the past week? - Yeah, you hear about No Nose Tony? They're still scraping his guts off of the sidewalk. - You guys are mental. He fell fixing his roof. - That's bullshit. I don't feel safe. - Lucky, you wouldn't feel safe fucking in a field of four-leaf clovers. I gotta go take a squirt. - Now where are you going? - I'm going to the choke the cannoli. I'll be right back. You're a real fucking class act, Cheech, you know. Mary Mother of God. - Do something. - Baby, you've been replaced. - That's one hell of a nun. - I wanna know who's the sick fuck who okayed that whore to dress like that? - Damned if I know. I didn't even know they hired a new girl. - Can you believe that fucking Lucky, Bobo? I swear to god if his mother didn't run the operation he'd be taking swimming lessons in the Providence River with concrete water weights. Bobo. Hey, Bobo! Bobo, what gives? This ain't no game of hide and seek. Bobo! - Hi, I got a confession for ya, Sister. I only wear this ring to pick up the chicks. - Oh, baby, when I'm done with you, you know what you're gonna be picking up? - What's that, Sister? - Your fucking guts off the floor. Does anyone else have something to confess? - There's a killer on the! - Boss, I got someone down here you should take a look at. - Kill her. - I hope my dear mother doesn't find out about this. - You bitch! I'm gonna eat your fucking guts like they were manicotti. - Ta-da! - Jesus Christ. - Where's Corbucci? - Cor, who? I don't know any Corbucci, I swear to God. - You can swear to God all you want, jerk off. I do his dirty work, and I can tell you that God doesn't give one fuck about you! - Please, I'm a good Catholic. - Where is he? I was told he'd be here tonight. You have three seconds. - A hitman disguised as a nun, now I fuckin' seen it all, haven't I? - Corbucci, shouldn't you be home fucking your mother? - Nice talk. That's, really that's nice talk. But none of that matters anymore because now I've got you. Vengeance is mine, bitch. - I knew she was no match for them. - She didn't have time for proper training, for proper guidance. We've become to hasty in sending these novices out into the field. - But there was no time. Operation Friday Plant was a top priority as you well know, Sister. - With Sister Envy eliminated, who's going to take her place? - The next chosen nun is many miles away, and we have been watching this nun closely. And this nun is dynamite. - Really, Sister Kelly, I can see that I should take at least partial responsibility for this. I should have made your first solitary meditation a little longer, after the um, the shower incident. - Hey, don't try to pin that on me, Mother Superior, that wasn't my fault. - Nonsense! In all of my years in giving service to the good Lord, I have never, ever seen such reckless behavior. - Have you ever noticed how wonderful breasts are, Sister Kelly? - Huh? - What a gift from the Lord they are. They have so many uses. - Yeah, well, not when you're a nun, then they're about as useful as hubcaps on a tractor. - Oh, come one now, Sister Kelly, that's not the spirit. I mean your breasts are like your two best friends, they're always there when you need them. - Best friends hardly. - You just haven't properly learned how to love your breasts. Let me help show you how. - For the last time, Sister Sappho, when are you gonna stop being such a sucker for my tits? - I can see now that what happened that day is a mere symptom of a bigger problem of temperament, and self-control. - But Mother, I- - No, there is nothing you can say to change. - But he- - No! There is no mitigating circumstances in which you ever lay hands on a priest. - The laying on of hands is venerated tradition, but laying someone out with a communion chalice is something else entirely. - Yes, Father, you're right. I am sure that Sister Kelly is sorry. No! I don't feel bad about it. He was sodomizing one of the parishioners in the confessional. God knows he deserved worse, and I would have to but those cups are too damn flimsy to bash somebody's head in with! - The confessional is a place of sacred secrecy. No! Look we've all had sex in the confessional before, but we are not all trying to ball a 14-year-old girl scout. - I was do nothing of the sort. I was simply trying to- - Grab her cookies. - Enough! Sister Kelly, I don't care what the father was doing in the confessional or who he was doing in the confessional, that is not what matters here today. What matters is that you are not fit to be a nun at Our Lady of the Blessed Passivity. I've transferred you to St. Vrains. - No! - Yes, St. Vrains of the unrepentant sinner. After a year there you will be praying to come back. - Have fun at St. Vrains. That's where all the bad girls go. And when you get really bad, you can come back to me. Cocksucker. - Hey now, got a good look to you. Cute face. And that bag you're wearing can't keep that slamming body of yours under wraps. You got a name, pudding? Hey, I'm just trying to be friendly. - Hey, watch where you're going. - She just couldn't take her eyes off of Emilio back there. - I'm sorry. - Hey, now was that polite. I just wanted to know what your name was. - My name's Kelly Johnson. I'm a novice in the Carmelite order of nuns. - Hey. - Really? 'Cause I thought your name was pussy. And you're gonna be working for me from here on out, pussy. It's time for you to eat the host, Sister. - How about some nuts for an appetizer? - You fucking bitch! She's not gonna give it up easy, Emilio. - Shut up. Come hold her down. - You better watch out you don't hurt yourself. Can't just bust in a nun like any old bitch. The cherries are all pit. You could snap it off in there. - Broken harder pussies than this one. - Tiny, put here up face down. She wants to be a pain in the ass, can play that way too. - Which one of you motherfuckers is next to die? - Stupid fuckin', whore! - Monsters! Try to rape a nun! - Hey, pussy. I'm not done with you yet. - Sister Kelly Johnson. - Yeah, you must be from St. Vrains. - Sister Kelly Johnson, prepare to meet your maker. - What? - Are you Sister Kelly? - Yes, I, um, did I, have I, is this hell? - No, it's not hell, toots. - Who are you? - Well, I'm Oscar, your guardian angel. - Guardian angel? Where the hell were you when those goons where trying to rape me? - Wait, back off. - And where the hell where you when I was getting my ass blown away by an AK-47, huh? Some guardian angel you are. - Bitch, I was buying smokes. Do you have any idea how hard it is to get menthol up here? Now get off my fucking case before I send you straight to hell. Angels can do that you know. - Okay, okay. - Geez Louise. Come on Sister Short Fuse, I got somethin' to show ya. - Sisters and Sisters, I am pleased to introduce to you tonight's main attraction. The Gurby parishioner is proud to present the one, the only, the king. - You have Elvis here? - No, not, not quite. Is that? - Yes, it is. That's the J Man. Ain't he a beaut? - Why are you still naked? - 'Cause I'm an angel. - This is amazing. - I know. He wants to meet with you backstage after the performance. Hey, Chief, I got someone here to see ya. - I'm so glad you could make it, Sister Kelly. Oscar, hand 'em over. - But, boss. - Thank you. You can go no, Oscar. - You know my name, Lord. - Please, call me husband not Lord. Bride of Christ means just that, I'm married to every last nun, which is ironic because back on earth that would make me a Mormon. - Uh, why am I here, husband? - To train. - What? - I'm sending you back as a emissary on earth. - Uh, I'm no prophet. I, I wouldn't know what to say, and people keep telling me that I have this wicked temper problem. - I'm not sending you back as a prophet. I'm sending back as a sanctified crusader, a member of the Order of the Black Habit. - The what? - The Order of the Black Habit. Since you've already gained access into heaven, you know mortal sins aren't a problem for you anymore. Let's face it some people just need to die. - What? Don't get all bent out of shape about it. I mean these are people that weren't gonna be saved anyway. You know like drug dealers, and pimps, mafia dons, CEOs of major corporations, you know that kind of thing. - This is got to be some sort of mistake. - No, it's not. I've seen your work back on earth. The Order of the Black Habit would be a perfect fit for you. - Well, what do I have to lose? - That's the spirit. But first we train. - Oh, the Order of the Black Habit, why didn't I think of that before? It all makes sense, yeah. You think I'm fuckin' idiot? You seriously gonna sit there and look at me in my eye, and tell me there's a secret organization of supernatural vigilante nuns, what do I look like, huh? What do I fucking look like? The type of mook? - I'm telling you the truth. You must believe me. For over 1500 years The Order of the Black Habit has been fighting crime and keeping the world safe from evil. They answer only to the pope. - Boss, uh, maybe he's tellin' the truth. I mean after all he is a priest. - I swear to God in heaven, I wouldn't lie to you, Mr. Corbucci. - I believe you, I really do. I'll tell you what, you tell me where their hideout is, Priest, and I swear on my mother's grave, I'll let you walk out of here. - You don't understand, every member of the clergy has taken an oath of silence concerning the details of The Order of the Black Habit. I'll be damned to Hell for all eternity if I utter a word. - Hell? Hear that boys, he's afraid of hell. You see I'm the one you should be afraid of, Priest. All the fires of hell are nothing compared to what I got in store for you if you don't start talking. - Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. - Untie him. - Thy kingdom come. - It's not Friday is it boys? - No, boss, it's uh, it's Tuesday. - Good, then we can have meat for dinner. - No, Vincent, my son. For the love all that's holy don't do this. I'm married you and your wife. - Yeah, and I hate that bitch. No, no! - Now I know why cows are sacred, they taste divine. - I'm supposed to learn how to fight from you? You're a pacifist. - Oh, you are mistaken. I was never a pacifist. I mastered fighting without fighting, the highest level of martial arts you can achieve, which is why they send all new recruits to me. - Fair enough. So what do I get to learn first? - Oh, the deadliest of all martial arts, nun fu. - Hey, aren't you suppose to teach me some moves first? - No, need, these are demon ninjas that were created to harmonize your body with the fighting spirit within you. The harder you fight the more knowledgeable you will become. Now enough talk. Let's get it on. - I give up. They're too much, I can't win. - Get up, I will have no coward nuns in my dojo. - Whatever happened to turn the other cheek? Silly Sister, these are demon ninjas. Now get up and find your inner warrior nun. Congratulations, you have reached the highest level of understanding of unarmed combat. There is nothing further I can teach you. Just remember the nun that hesitates horizontally meditates. - So Mohamed says to the hooker, "That's all I get for a buck." - What the hell was that? - Oh, don't mind him. Gandhi, fantastic instructor, brilliant martial artist, he's just a little- - He hit me with a fucking cattle prod! - Sounds like she got off easy. - That's right, Lord. - Well, here's something that'll put a smile on your face. - I quit, I quit! - Are you sure this okay, husband? - Well, you gotta learn to shoot and he's gotta learn to quit smoking so it all works out. - There are some commandments that are not written in stone. - And what are those, oh mighty Moses? - Thou shall not fuck with nuns. - Well, that was fun. - Yeah. - Well, it's nearly time, are you ready to go back? - Oh, I don't feel ready, and I don't wanna leave you. Well, I'm sure we'll be seeing each other at some point. Good luck down there. No. We'll have none of that. - Sister Lust, how do you like your sausage? - Hot, thick, and juicy. - Uh, do you want it in your buns? I mean on a bun, the singular, not the pubic, the plural. - Honey, at this point I'll take it any way and anywhere I can get it. - How do you get a nun pregnant? - How? - You dress her up as an altar boy. Mother Superior, in five, four, three, two. - Welcome back from paradise, Sister Wrath. - Sister Wrath? - Yes, you've been rechristened now that you're the newest member of The Order of the Black Habit. - Are you ready to pass judgment on those who would prey on the weak and the helpless? - Are you willing to send the scum of the earth straight to hell? - Okey-dokey. - What? - First let me make some introductions. I'm the Mother Superior of St. Vrains. You may just call me Mother. This is my assistant, Father Sheamus O'Bannon. He handles logistics, blesses our weapons, and takes care of all the little things that help our convent run smoothly. Also Father Francis Thomas. He conducts weddings, takes confession, and also cooks our meals. And I believe you've already met some of our other initiates. Sisters Lust, Pride, and Gluttony. - These are the freaks that shot me in the alley. - God's will, bitch. - Sister Gluttony! It was predestination. You had to die in order to be reborn. It's, it's. - It's a mystery. - Yes, quite. Now for your first mission. It is traditional for a nun to take care of the person that killed their predecessor. - Predecessor? - This is, was Sister Envy. She was murdered while trying to take out Ricardo Corbucci, one of the most feared members of the Rizzo crime family. For the past 10 years the Rizzo crime family have committed all manner of crimes against the people of this city. Their primary business is in prostitution and as a result they have a huge presence in human trafficking, narcotics, and bribery, and they're not afraid to kill any one that gets in their way. - Corbucci and his men take their orders from Louise Rizzo, aka Momma Rizzo, arguably the fiercest mobster on the East Coast. She's also, we believe responsible for the death of Father Jacob Michaels this week. - One morning we awoke to what appeared to be a fresh shipment of hamburger on the front door of our church. Good thing we discovered his church ID while making meatballs out of him for the homeless shelter. Now go forth, Sister Wrath, load your guns with bullets and fill your heart with the love of the Lord. - Detective Vargas, we found these near the body. - Saint Christopher's medal, used to wear these as kids. Not a Catholic, huh? - No, sir, Baptist. - Saint Christopher carried the baby Jesus across the river, that's what Christopher means, Christ bearer. He's supposed to look over you, you know protect you. - Well, he didn't do such a good job with these stiffs, did he? - Unless he was protecting someone else. Have it checked for prints. Right away, Detective Vargas. - I've been trying to catch you and your buddies for over a year now, fuck face. I guess somebody up there likes me after all. - Sugar, you better know what you're doing in there. This isn't Sunday school, this is the real world. - I'll be fine. - I don't know, you look like a little girl from where I'm standing. You look like you might actually start to cry if there's trouble. - Fuck off! - Remember, you're not a cat, as a nun you only have two lives if you get blown away tonight then it's goodnight Irene. - Why are fucking riding me, bitch? - Because the first night I saw you in that alley I knew you weren't worthy of being a member of The Black Habit. You're just a pussy nun. - Sister Gluttony, I'm gonna be the habit that breaks you. - Prepare to receive good news, jive turkey! You got serious moxie, kid. Welcome to the club. - So I woke up for two days, my ma saw the coke, she snorts it. Ma, what you doing? Boom. - I've been living there all my life. You want a piece of chicken? Yeah, all right, I'll take one. - Hey, it's good Italian chicken I'll tell ya. - You want a meatball? - Yeah, I want a meatball. - You want a meatball, here take your fuckin' meatball. - Mr. Corbucci, what a pleasure to see you this evening. Your usual table I'm sure. - That'll be just fine, Mario. Thank you. I see everybody's enjoying their dinner tonight. That's good, that's good. We'll eat up, huh. Gather your strength 'cause tomorrow, tomorrow we go penguin hunting. Yeah, you heard me. I want a city wide search of all the churches, and I wanna find out who's harboring these murderers, and when you find 'em, I want them deader than Judas. - Oh, Madon' I hope my mother doesn't find out about this. - I want those fuckin' nuns dead, dead, dead, dead! Small potatoes, boss. - What are you taking about small potatoes? Those nuns killed some of our best men. - No, boss, small potatoes, I love 'em. - Hey, sweet cheeks, got someone to keep me and my friend warm for the ride home? - Sure thing, greaseball. - What the fuck was that? - Everyone sit down and shut the fuck up! Okay, everyone, this is what us nuns commonly refer to as a come to Jesus meeting. In other words we are gonna find out who's been naughty and who's been nice. Bruno Cozzi, the church finds you guilty of the sins of extortion, murder, and drug trafficking. How do you plead? - Uh, uh, uh, I'm innocent. I was framed. - Wrong answer. What's going in there? - There's a really pissed off nun in there inflicting a righteous judgment. - Lucio Bavo, the church finds you guilty of the sins of murder, racketeering, and child pornography, you sick fuck. How do you plead? - I demand the right to speak to an attorney. Sure thing. You'll find plenty of 'em in hell. - Lucio! - I told him to stay away from the child porn. - Okay, here's the fuckin' plan. - Guilty! - Vincent, Paulie, you guys go to the rear and call for backup. - Guilty. - What, what should I do, boss? - You're gonna kill that fuckin' nun. - Okay. What? - Now I know you might all think that I have a bit of temper problem but there's just something about mobsters that really cheeses me off. - They don't call me Lucky for nothing. - You're so unlucky that you could fall into a barrel of tits and come out sucking your thumb. Oh, no. My hand. - She'll be fine. - If any of you could tell me where I could find Richie Corbucci, I just might let you go back to finishing your overpriced chicken cacciatore. - Hey, penguin. Hey, hey, hey, hey, calm down, huh, no hard feelings. I'll tell you what, I swear on my grandmother's eyes, you put that gun down I'll let you walk out of here alive. - Well, I bet she won't see this coming. - Oh, thank god, I'm alive. Holy shit! - Get in. Are you hurt, are you okay? - No, I'm fine, hardly a scratch. - And? - Dead, they're all dead, Corbucci included. - Well, well, I think this calls for a celebration. - Ooh, oh, baby. - Ooh. - That was nice. Now who wants some? - I'm gonna feel it in the morning but it's always worth it. - What the bubbly or the bottle? Well, both if you're doing it right. - Well, you can't have it. It's my party so I get the bottle if I want it. - Then you can have it. - What, I'm willing to share. - Ooh. - Father Thomas, are you peeping? - Uh, no, no, um, uh, I was just uh, polishing the knob. The, the doorknob 'cause it, it was, it was dusty. - Well, Father, anytime you wanna taste the forbidden fruit you know which door to knock on. - Oh, dear Lord help me. Let's get three of 'em down there and get all those people- - Captain, we got one more possible witness here. - Here? - Yeah. - Okay. - Those people stay in back. Make sure you get a name. - Someone wasn't very happy with their bill. - We got 10 stiffs in total all from the Rizzo family. Two of 'em are gonna be a bitch to identify. - Why is that, Sam? - Well, how do use dental records when their heads are blown off? - I told you this case was gonna be like pulling teeth. - We found him hiding in the upright freezer near the rib roast. He says, "His name name is Mario Dematto." - Hey, Mario, be a pal will you, tell us who did this, otherwise I'm gonna have to stick you back in the freezer, okay. Come on, you can do it. Come on, let it out. Come on, we get paid by the hour now, come on. That's it, sweetheart, come on, let it out. - Nun! - What's the good word, Vargas? - Well, it looks like what we have here is a psychopathic vigilante nun armed with a 12 gauge shotgun on savage murder spree. - You know that's just the kind of story the press is gonna love to blow out of proportion. - What? What? You just let another nun stroll into one of our businesses and whack half my best men. - Got a arm full of balls here, kid. - What have you gone all faggoty on me, Richie, is that it? - Hold still, Richie. - No, Momma, it's not like that. It's just that, you know. - What do I know? The only thing I know is I gotta replace all these stiffs, and if you don't start showing me some results fuckin' pronto, you'll get replaced to. Now what's the goddamn problem, Richie? - The problem is, is that they're nuns. Every time they show up my boys they freeze. They think that if they kill nun they'll go straight to hell. - Come on. - Or worse. - Are you fuckin' kidding me? You kill who I order you to kill. I don't give a shit if they're nuns, Mother Teresa or Pope John Paul I for fuck sake. - Momma, Pope John Paul I is already dead. - Shut up, I know that. Don't you think I know that? I was speaking metaphorically. Just look at what they did to my poor boy. Now I'm gonna have to go back to wiping his fanny again like when he was six. - Momma, jeez, not in front of the guys. - Momma, I don't mean any disrespect but why you hate nuns so much? - Well, years ago before I became the most feared mom boss in all of New England, I, I wanted to be a nun. Shut up shit stain, I'm tellin' an emotional story over here. - I'm sorry, Momma. - Well, those twittering little twats down at the convent they said, "I was too uncouth for the sisterhood." You believe that happy horse shit? - I'm overwhelmed with incredulity. - Me too, uncouth my balls. Well, when they wouldn't let me pledge myself to God, I sold my soul to the Devil for wealth, and power, and beauty. And now to honor Satan I help him by damming those souls. I provide people with vices like drugs, and alcohol and gambling, and whores. - Momma, you feeling all right? - You think I'm crazy don't you? Well, I'll show you who's crazy. I have a solution to our little problem. A killer who doesn't fear anyone not even the clergy. - Oh, the jew-manity. - Viper, you got a call. - This better be good. All right, I'll be there in a half hour. - Jeez, Viper, Lou's dead. - He was dead the minute he stepped in the ring with me. - Momma, I don't mean any disrespect but I don't feel too comfortable about bringing an outsider down here to do our job. I mean I got a reputation to uphold and the boys they look up at me. - Lucky, get the door. - Ma, come on, look at me. Who the hell are you? Listen, the Silverbird bar mitzvah two doors over. So uh, why don't you take it on the heels, okay? Look, jew boy, why don't you take that hook nose of yours and get the hell. - Well, I haven't seen you since Christ was a cowboy. Richie, let me introduce you to Viper Goldstein, the murderist mohel. He once wiped out a whole gang in an afternoon and still made it home on time for an evening bris. Viper, say hello to the boys. - Shalom, scumbags. - So Viper, do you think you can help rid us of our little problem? - Sure, and this week I'm running a special, 5,000 for priest, 10,000 for bishops, and 1,000 for nuns. - Why so cheap for nuns? - I like killing nuns. - Ma, you can't just let some Hebrew hard-on walk in here and take over our operation. - And why not? - Because his people killed Christ. - Well, do you have anything you'd like to add to this? - His fighting style's uh unorthodox. - Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray the Lord my soul to keep, if I die before I wake, I pray the Lord my soul to take. God bless Mother Superior, Father O'Bannon, the Sisters, Smith, Wesson, President Jimmy Carter, whoever invented beer. - Are you asleep, Sister Wrath? - No. You can call me Kelly. - You can call me Jenna. Kelly, can I ask you a question? - Sure. - Why did you join the sisterhood? - Well, I'm an orphan. - Sorry. What happened to your parents? - My dad was a cop working on a case involving the Falsto crime family. - I think I've heard of them. Didn't they- - When I was 12 I woke up to the sound of gunshots coming from the living room. I just thought it was the TV, so I ran down there, and I saw my parents being shot to death by a mafia hitman. - What did you do? - What could I do? I hid as fast as I could. Took everything I had not to scream or cry, but I saw them, I saw them die. - Kelly, I'm sorry. - After that I was sent to an orphanage. It was seeing the Sisters there that made me wanna become a nun. When I made my vows to God I made another vow and this one to myself. I vowed to exterminate every single member of the Falsto crime family for what they did to my family. - Oh, my god that was you. - Yeah, that was me. So why'd you become a nun? - Well, my story's not as colorful as yours. My parents sent me to a convent. - Why? - Well, I was different. - Different? Different like how? I like girls. - Well, who doesn't? - I like girls a lot. Oh. There's room for two. What? - Do you really wanna have sex this way? - I thought that's how you were suppose to do it. - Let me show you how we have sex in the convent. Eat me! Lick me up like a dog! - Dear Lord, it's your humble servant Sister Lust. Now I don't ask for much from you Lord, but can you please send me some cock pronto. White cock, brown cock, yellow cock, it doesn't matter. Five inches, six inches, I don't need some John Holmes motherfucker to be happy. Now every day I risk my ass for you Lord, at least you could so is give me something to put in it. - It's not easy being the boss. - Tell me about it. Hey there, Momma. Sounding a little tense. - Oh, it's you. You had me worried. - Oh, there's nothing to be worried about darling. Listen, why don't you let me rub some of that tension out of you, huh? - Oh, that's good. It's those fucking nuns again. You know the story. But I got someone to help out. You're gonna like him, nice Jewish boy. - Oh, that'd be Viper Goldstein, yeah. He's good in a pinch. His organization hasn't changed with the times. Nuns nowadays use automatic weapons. They'd grind him up into Hebrew National Sausage tout suite, unless you catch 'em when they least expect it. Send him to Barnun tonight, you'll get the results you're looking for. - But how will we know they'll be there, Lord of the Flies, my Prince of Darkness? No need for formals, baby, we go way back you and I. Call me Samael or Sammy, it's easier on the tongue. - Okay, Sammy, but how will we make this happen? Don't worry your pretty little head about that. I've got a contact on the inside, everything's gonna be perfect, just perfect. - Someone on the inside. What is it you're not telling me? - Don't you worry about that. Have I ever led you astray? What a man, what a man. - Mother Superior is on retreat for a couple days, so she has asked me to do the briefing for your next mission. - Father O'Bannon, no disrespect, but we only take our orders from Mother Superior. This is totally against protocol. - These orders come down directly from the Vatican, Sister Gluttony, so if you don't mind we'll continue. It's come to church's attention that a group of rogue nuns has established a terrorist stronghold at this night club. It's the Vatican's belief that they're looking to overthrow Holy Mother Church, and begin a new order based on pre-Vatican II doctrine. We cannot allow this to happen. You're to go there tonight, gather as much information as you can, return for a debriefing, so the intelligence can be relayed to Rome as soon as possible. - Well, do we have a contact at the club? Are we looking for any one specific? I mean if they're actually terrorist- - No questions, Sister Wrath. Much like the Bible itself some things must be taken on faith. - Taking orders from a man I feel so dirty. - Well, whatever's going on let's keep an eye out for each other tonight. - Password, bitches. Ah, that's enough of that shit, welcome to Barnun. - Give me back my rosary beads you whore. - Come and get 'em, Sister. It's not my first time at the rodeo. - Whoo hoo, slug her. Hit that bitch. - You weren't expected back until late. - What is the meaning of this? - Oh, it's a mystery. - Homicide, Vargas. Hey, how are you? I told you not to call me here. Yeah, it's okay. How are ya? Yeah, yeah, I'd like to get together, do that, that thing on top of the washer machine. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Wear that outfit I got ya, okay? Yeah, all right. Yeah, yeah, hold on a minute. Larry. - Yeah. - Your wife on three. Sweet mother of pearl, this coffee taste like it was brewed in my grandmother's enema bag. - I've had your grandmother's enema bag blend, it's smoother. What do you got for me? - We got a positive fingerprint ID on the Saint Christopher medal, Detective Vargas. Her name is Sister Kelly Johnson, 22-years-old, clean record. - What are the chances that she's the killer? - None. - Damn, you have a problem. - The only problem I have is that I'm out of lime wedges. - All right, girls, let's get down to business. Sister Gluttony, Sister Lust, you two sweep the bar, see if you find any suspicious. Sister Pride and I will work the staff. - Speaking of working the staff, did you see how cute Father Thomas's ass looked in those tight pants of his? One of these days I'm gonna throw him down and ride him like Black Beauty. Okay, okay, let's get to work. - Hey, uh, Viper. - What? - Isn't it uh, that time of year for you guys now? - What do you mean? - You know uh, Jewish Christmas, happy harmonica and all that shit, huh? - It's Hanukkah you fucking greaseball. - Hey, hey, hey, Viper, relax, relax, calm down. You gotta excuse Paulie over here, speech is his second language. - Hey, Viper. - What now? - Is it true what they say that uh, you got your pinky ring cut off on your family jewels? Uh-huh. - Oy. - Hold it. Gotta hand over your weapons if you wanna come in here. - So what's that one called? - Uh, Crucifix Nail, it's tequila and holy water. You know what I feel like doing? - What? - That's what. - You taste like a salt lake. - Hey, pillow lips, you wanna dance? - Beat it, Sasquatch, she's my date. - What's the matter your little bitch do all the talking for ya? - From now on I think I'll let my friend Mr. Bar Stool do all the talking. - Mr. Bar Stool? - Now you've done it. - What is it? - It's a bomb. - Okay, the way I see it we have two options. Option one, we go upstairs, we tell the girls, we go back to St. Vrains and let Mother Superior know. - That's not violent enough. What's option two? - Option two, we go in there, we splatter their brains all over the walls, and gain sainthood in the afterlife. - Saint Lust, has a nice ring to it don't ya think? - Okay, Sisters, put your hands up, and step away from the bomb. Corbucci, you're supposed to be dead. - I'm the Resurrection, bitch. - Sisters, Sisters, this is very un-nun like behavior. - Shut up, pris. - Jesus Christ. - Jews. - Hey, let's go upstairs and see how Viper's doing. - All right, boss. Holy fuck, it's a miracle! - It's not a miracle, ass clown, it's bulletproof. - You miserable slut! I eat nuns for fucking breakfast! - You're gonna fucking pay for that peckerwood. - Tonight we find out who the real chosen ones are, sluts. - You think you can scare us? We're nuns, we don't know the meaning of the word fear. We are strong, dedicated woman who laugh in the face of danger. So if you think that you can just waltz in here and kill my fellow women of the cloth, you've got another thing coming. - Come on, girls, let's get 'em! - Yipes. - Open the door, he's gonna kill us all. - We'll pray for you. - All out? Let's finish this shit old school. - My people invented old school, bitch. Let me introduce to the Bronowitz brothers, Levi and Eli. They're CPAs. - CPAs? - Certified Penguin Assassins, practitioners of the ancient art of Jew Jitsu. - Oy. - Vey. Mazel tov. - God, now would be a really good time for a miracle. Behind the bar. - What? - Behind the bar, your miracle. Good luck, sister. - Uh, he fucking broke my nose. - Decide that you'd had enough old school? - Let her go, I'll let you walk out of here alive. - How about instead you let me go and I let her live? - Shoot him, Kelly, I'm not afraid. Looks like what they say about nuns going all lesbo when they're locked up together without any dick isn't that far from the truth. Mazel tov, bitch. - Tell me who set us up. - I can't okay. I can't, okay, okay, okay, I'll tell you, okay. It was that Priest O'Bannon okay. He's the one you wanna kill, you don't wanna kill me. I think I'm gonna throw up. - O'Bannon, huh. That crucifix you're wearing. - Yeah. - Do you believe in Jesus? - Oh, yeah, I believe in Jesus with all my heart and soul, I do, I do. - You wanna meet him? - Of course, yeah, bring 'em. No, no, no, I don't wanna meet him, I don't wanna meet him. - Father, I think it's time we heard your confession. - Hey, what's with the frickin' water works? You can't have another yeast infection already. Fluci's Bakery down the street doesn't pump out as much sourdough as you. - That's not it, Momma, bitch don't wanna work. - What do you mean don't wanna work? Listen, sweetie, what's wrong? Tell Momma everything. - It's, it's just this client I have a date with. - Mario Drip Dick Carcheri. - He wants me to do some really sick stuff. - Honey, he's a man, all man wanna do sick stuff with women, otherwise we'd all be out of a job. Listen, pumpkin, why don't you whisper in Momma's ear what he wants you to do. Fuck me sideways that is pretty sick. - So you're not gonna make me do it right, Momma? - Oh, the fuck I'm not. Set up a camera in there and take some photos. There's a big market for that in Germany. - No. Ow! - Those are for company. - Ma. - Douche. Well, well, well, who do we have here? - She's a nun in The Order of the Black Habit. - Great, great. Did you get the others? - We got one, the other two got away. But I'm sure this little bitch will serve as the perfect nun bait for the rest of them. - And Richie and Paulie? - Both dead. - Ah, pity, I'll miss them sort of. Well, never send a goy to do a man's work right, Viper? While we're waiting for your little friends to show up I think I'll put you to work. Make Momma back some of the money you cost us. You have an opening for this one? - I think I can find something appropriately hideous. - Keep an eye on her. - I want first crack at her. - Her? Why her? - I like fucking nuns. - Oh, you are downright evil, Viper. I like that in a man. You know maybe if you play your cards right you could take Corbucci's place and Lucky's place too. I know, I know he's my son, but now he couldn't win the bronze medal in the Special Olympics. I gotta go take a dump. - What the fuck are you looking at Jerry's kid? - Where am I? - From the looks of things I'd say you're in hell. - Sisters, what's, what's gotten into you? - Shut up. Now before I blew that scumbag Corbucci away he told me, "You were the rat behind this." You fuckin' set us up. - Now Sister Gluttony is dead, and they've kidnapped Sister Pride. So Father, unless you tell me where their hideout is, I'm gonna turn you into the holiest priest in town. - Is that so? You unholy whores always resorting to violence to solve your problems. There was a time when this church truly believed in non-violence, when the whole damn thing was overseen by wise, benevolent old men. And now it's come to this, a nun threatening to torture a man anointed by the church. - You're the one that sold us out to the mob. You think they're better? - They're good Catholics, they're men. They go to confession and repent when they've had somebody killed, rather than just rely on their promised place in heaven. - That's what it all comes down to for you, isn't it? That they're men. - No, I'm just tired of you nuns running the show around here. Before you, we priests actually meant something. We were men with influence. Mob bosses, politicians, business men, everybody listened when we talked. We were the ultimate gatekeepers of the Kingdom of Heaven. Now all we do is wash the blood stains out of your filthy habits. - Now you know what women were doing for years before you came along. - And that's as it should be. - You'd send us to our deaths just to keep what you see as your rightful place in line? You're one sick fuck, Father. But I don't have time for your bullshit theology. You're going to tell me where the mob took Sister Pride or you'll be getting your final judgment sooner rather than later. - Uh, I feel so guilty. If I had just been here, I might of been able to prevent this. - Thomas, you probably would of gotten killed right along with Mother Superior. Consider yourself blessed. - Dear Lord, bless these servants who fight in your name. May their limbs be swift, may their minds be nimble, and may their bullets always find their mark. Amen. - Thank you, Father Thomas. Now you have to leave here soon as possible, we might of been followed, promise? - I promise, Sister. He's a priest, I could go straight to hell for that, but I could die. If I make it out of this alive, Father Thomas, I swear I'm gonna give you something real juicy to mention at confession. Priest. So do you have a plan? - I do, but you're not gonna like it. - Does it involve me killing bad guys? - Sure does. - Then I'm behind you a 100%. Okey-dokey. - Must be all playing frickin' bingo. - That must be the winner. - Yeah, down here fellas, yeah, this way. Yeah, closer, closer. What the fuck took you assholes so long? - Holy stigmata. - Ah, oy vey, I don't know whether to laugh or cry. Don't worry, baby, I'll be gentle at first. - Welcome to Momma Rizzo's Hooker Heaven. How can we help you? - I heard you were in the market for some tender young chicken. - We're always in the market for some chicken if it's fresh enough. - Is 14 too old? - No, it's perfect. 14 you say? - Yeah, her mother's a dirty smack whore, she owes me some money, so she lets me babysit little brown sugar here. - Nice. Firm. I'll give you $500 for her. - Did you just call my mother a dirty smack whore? - I was acting. Come on, let's go find Sister Pride. - I'm worth a lot more than 500 bucks sansnatch. - Don't worry, baby, it's kosher. - All right, you go find Momma Rizzo, and I'll find Sister Pride. - All right. Watch your ass in this place, and your vag. - Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, it's okay, I'm not gonna rush anything. I know the importance of foreplay for you women. Oh, yeah, yeah, you wanna find some eggs, huh? Honey, you wanna find some eggs? - You're one sick fucking bunny. - Got you now, bitch. - Get off her or I'll blow your fucking brains out. - It's okay, baby. - Put me you down you jive ass motherfucker. Gladly. - Oh, my lucky fucking day, they're falling like manna from heaven. - Caught this one sneaking around. I bet there's more around here somewhere. - Well, then let's go greet our new visitors shall we? - I love beating nuns. - Well, what do we have here? - Oh, very cute, you think you can get the drop on me, you got another thing coming. Now we can both die here or we can both walk out of here, and hunt each other down later like the dogs that we are. - Only problem for you is. - We work in pairs. - I've hunted down every last member of the Falsto crime family for what they did to my parents. And before they died every single one of them told me the same thing, "That they'd been hired to do the job by someone who called herself Big Momma." I don't suppose you know who that could of been do you? - Oh, fuck you, Sister. Look I know you're gonna kill me just do me the favor of not boring me to death. Oh, my daddy got killed over business boohoo. Wah, wah, wah, Mommy and Daddy got gunned down. Save it for the confessional. I'm gonna make this hurt so bad, you're gonna remember me when you're dead. Goodnight my sweet little penguin. - Momma. - Lucky. Fuck me. - I guess I am lucky after all, Momma. - I think we'll be okay now. - Freeze. - It's not what it looks like. - Sister Kelly Johnson, I'm placing you under arrest for murder, kidnapping, and conspiracy to commit murder. And you missy, are an accomplice. Let me at 'em, let me at 'em! All I need is five minutes alone with 'em! - Take it easy, they're nuns for Christ's sake. - 12 years of Catholic school, I want my revenge! - Get out of here! Look Sisters, I just want you to know before we book you that if I had my way I would just let you off with some strong warning or community service or something. - Yeah, you nuns did this city a pretty big favor. Problem is they're gonna wanna repay you with a one way ticket to the electric chair. - Who the hell is that? - Hey, uh, what are ya doin'? These ladies, they no go to jail, officers. - Your Holiness. - They is protected under the canon law. I granted them a divine pardon. - Dude, it's the fucking pope. Can you believe that shit? - Kiss, kiss. Oh, yeah, oh yeah, more, more, more. Ah, yes, my precious pious pussies with the razor claws, and the throbbing thoroughfares. You make uh, Pope Corky IV uh, very, very proud. - And we can make you a very, very happy man. - Isn't this amazing? - Yeah, I thought they only liked boys. - Well, I guess it's like they say, all's well that ends well. - I'm gonna go take a shower, you wanna come? - Nah, I think I'm gonna sleep for about a week after this. - Suit yourself. I'll be back in a minute to keep you company. - Cozy in here, isn't it? - Aren't you supposed to watching over Sister Wrath? - Oh, she'll be fine, that girl is a rock. Angels like to cuddle. - Get off of me. - Hold me! Why won't you hold me? - Thought you were through with me, demon bitch? - Let me guess, you're gonna rape me and then kill me, probably in some sort of demonic sacrifice. - That would be my choice if I had one. - Oh, spare me. You know what the difference between you and me is? - Hmm, that I have the gun and you're the one who has to shut up or I'm going to kill you slowly and painfully. - Nope. The difference is one of us isn't scared to die. - Oh, the boss is gonna be sore over this one. - Is this hell? - Hell? Why you little communion wafer pusher. - Help, no! Oh, Father, I, I need hail Mary full of grace. Momma! - I think there's been a mix up. Jesus. - You've got to be kidding me. Oh, it's no joke, Sister. You committed the gravest sin imaginable, and for that you get to spend eternity here with me where your flesh will be ripped from its bones, your eyes gouged from their sockets, and your limbs torn apart, only so you can be put back together, and have it done all over again, and there's not a damn thing that you can do about. - Oh, there's something I can do about it. - Oh, and what's that, child? - I'm gonna kick your fucking ass. - So you're not gonna talk, huh? - Listen, how many times do I gotta tell ya, I'm not saying anything to you pigs until after I talk to my lawyer. Oh, no. What the hell was that? - I ain't having none of that.
