Well, Fridolin, I don't know. Don't panic, Mommy. You have to cross two major main roads. I can take you with me in the car. No no, Katja goes to school like that. But for me... it's somehow too dangerous. Oh Mom, I'm not a baby anymore. In 8 years, I'll be 18 and already driving around in Daddy's car. Understood. And when the time comes, I'll take over the roller skates. Dad, these aren't roller skates. They're blades. All right, here we go. - But take care, okay? - Yes, of course. So... - Bye. - Bye. Bye. Katja! Fridolin... This should be pretty clear by now. How many times does 88 go into 448? Four times. Sit down. ♪ View God's abundance daily; ♪ ♪ The beauty of these gardens see, ♪ ♪ Behold how they for me and thee ♪ ♪ Have decked themselves so gaily. ♪ ♪ Have decked themselves so gaily. ♪ That was a high F. Fridolin. I know. Yes, then it would be nice if you would sing it too. F like Fridolin. Will you? Nice, easy, simple. Ms. Stuppe don't shift into fifth gear right away. Do you always have these sayings? ... hey, up you idiot! Ah, easy easy. With five going in, it's a valuable piece. - Proceeding. - There. What's up Dad? Did we get new furniture? Can you come with me? Mom and I need to talk to you. So, Fridolin, How shall I put it? There's a problem. Your mother and I, we made our decision. And... So. Well, go ahead. No, say it, Nelly. Look, Fridolin. Dad and I always have these... ... these arguments. And so we think it's best if we break up for a while. I mean... Because we just can't bear you to see us always fighting anymore. Oh, I don't mind. I sometimes argue with Alex. But for now, it's for the best, my darling. I mean, if I can change things... I promise you that... I will also do more homework and less computer games. I could also carry down the trash can and... It really has nothing to do with you, Fridolin. We both love you very much, and that's not going to change. If I hadn't gotten home from school earlier, you would have left by now, wouldn't you? No, certainly not. I just wanted to move the furniture. I would definitely have come back to explain everything to you. Look, the apartment is only a few minutes away from here and -- A moment! Listen, Fridolin. You gotta be strong now, you know? Sometimes we adults have to make such a decision, even if it hurts at first. But... ... with time it goes away. And hey, if you come to my place tomorrow we'll install a second big computer just for you. Play games all night. What do you think? Fridolin! Fridolin! Takes it very hard. Is it supposed to be great? I can stay a little longer. Half an hour doesn't change anything. You should have thought about that earlier, when it means separation for your son. I hope this Ines was worth destroying our family. Please don't start this again! Maybe I can come over for dinner in the evening. I don't want a restaurant where you can come and go as you please. I want a home. For me and my son. Everything has been cleared with the bank. I don't want you... ... lacking in anything. OK. Can you pick up the little one from school tomorrow, please? I have the presentation on Thursday. I'm nowhere yet. Sure, I'll do it. Well. Then... take care of yourself. And... If something happens to Fridolin please call me immediately, okay? Until tomorrow. Visit Daddy tomorrow. I don't want to go to Dad's. I want him to live here. I just don't get it. Here it goes. So you heard, building a shitty parking garage here? No, and? Fred and Tanja made out yesterday. - Who cares? - Me. We could try it too. Are you actually out of your mind? Man, what's wrong with you? My father has a mistress and has moved out. When? Yesterday. They're no more? But he has an apartment nearby. Two apple juices. Five marks. Thank you. Thanks. I want to ask you something, but... you must not tell anyone that I do not know. OK? OK. Well, actually, I do know. But I mean... what is a mistress, actually, exactly? Mistresses are women who hide when the wife shows up. Most of the time they see the man only in the hotel or in a parking lot. They are also always younger than the wife and do not have as many wrinkles yet. My father was also lured away from home by one. My mother says she stole his whole mind. Oh dear. Poor Dad. Fridolin, can you see if you can find the glasses. No. "No" ? - What are you doing there? - Headstand. And why? The gang says that when you have more blood in your head, you can think more logically. And why does one have to think logically now? Because I want to understand you. Because I want to know why you moved out and live in this stupid apartment. Vroom Listen, Fridolin. There is not just... ... one reason, one particular thing. There are many, many little things that make it so that two people no longer want to be together. It's hard to explain, but... When you grow up and have your own family, you will be able to understand. It's because Mom always talks to her plants? No. Although... Lately she's been talking to the yucca palm more than to me. Ah, there they are. Is it New Year's Eve already? Why? Well, because you bought champagne. I now have a new apartment. If by chance visitors come, you should have something to offer. From whom do you get a visit? From your beloved? Fridolin, please. Oh "Fridolin, please." Can't you even give me a clear answer? What is it anyway, a mistress? A mistress... It is a woman that you like very much. Like Mom? Yeah. Something like that. Why do you need a mistress now that you have Mommy? Fridolin, I've told you before, you're too young to understand -- Will now! And not when I grow up! That takes way too long for me! It's nice, is it time to go? Yeah, I don't want Mom to worry any more. Bye Dad. Oh! - Hello. - Oh hello. I am Ines. You must be Fridolin. It's nice to meet you. Are you the mistress? Fridolin! It's okay, Daniel. Ines is a good friend. She owns the gallery just around the corner. Can we have something to eat together? Yes gladly. Then maybe you can explain to me why -- Fridolin, I almost forgot your pocket money. Why, nice Monday? No, but still, just take it. Thanks. OK. - Bye. - Bye, Fridolin. Sorry. He's a bit confused. - It's no wonder. - Yes... But I don't want you to suffer from the breakup. Let's do something together. Get to know each other in peace. Good idea. My housewarming gift, an original Gerd Trunker Wow! Great. That's very sweet of you -- However, I have to borrow it again for the vernissage. Beautiful, have you really blossomed? No wonder Dad is away and you are chatting with the flower all the time. Fridolin! Was there something at Dad's? Yes. He spoke only of you and cried terribly. Stop with the nonsense. Why do you buy flowers? Don't we have enough? I got them as a gift. From who? From someone who wanted to give me a little pleasure. By the way, here's your pocket money. As of today, I'm the bank. Thank you Mama. Dad got a visit from Ines. Oh, yeah? - And how is she? - 100% ugly. Come on. We'll get this done quickly, the two of us. Today, are you ready? Yeah, yeah. Hm. Perhaps under "separation". - What are you doing that's so important? - Oh, you don't understand. Watch out, young man. Even in my old age I can still just about understand the computer. Come. I cooked alone for the first time by myself. I hope you like it. Hmmm. I wanted separation, not separation food. Huh? Hello. - Who are you? - Boschi. Now click me! Ah, that's better. How can I help you? Why did you call me? Huh? - I got you? - Called because you need help. Come on, Fridolin. Now we eat and then off to bed. No, please, I have something important to do. To prevent them from surrendering, the shaker must be switched on! The shaker! The shaker cannot be turned off; once turned on, it runs forever! Hello Boschi. It's me again, Fridolin. You wanted to help me. Joker. Where have you been for so long, I almost fell asleep? - What kind of problems do you have? - My father has a mistress. Because of her he moved out. Hm. And now you're sad. Then I'll cheer you up. That's childish. Yes, I am sad, but that is not so important. I really want to understand my parents. Then maybe I can get them back together. Hm. That is difficult. - Can't you help me anyway? - Maybe... There is a spell. However, it is not that simple. And I haven't done it in a long time. It doesn't matter at all. This is my only chance. please tell me what I have to do. It's very dangerous. If you do not reach your goal in 48 hours, there is no way back The spell will remain forever and ever. Great, I can do it! Please tell me what I have to do, Boschi. Do you know how long 48 hours is? - Man, what do you think? - Very good. Then pay attention now. I will now explain everything to you in detail. Fridolin. who are you talking to? With no one, are you that rude? Say, do you actually know what time it is? The night is for sleeping. Go to bed now and hurry up! Wait for me! Then. What a weird dream. Me as my son. Crazy. I have to tell you about this. So then I can wake up. When a person dreams... ... it's possible to walk through walls. Yahoo! This isn't a dream. This is a nightmare. Wake up. Fridolin, you have to go to school. Oh no, Dad. I'm so tired. It can't be true. First me and I'm him. I must have gotten out of my body somehow. I have to go back there somehow. Maybe with more power. Yeah! Oh again, super awesome! I want to do that too. You got me! Fridolin! Fridolin, did you hurt yourself? - It was super fun to go! One more time. - No Fridolin. Don't you see what happened? Yes, you're now... neat. It worked! I am you and you are me. - What's going on? - That was Boschi. Who? The computer Boschi, is this a kind of goblin on the Internet that helps children when they have problems. A goblin on the Internet? Tell me, Fridolin you are still ticking correctly? You said yourself that the future belongs to those who know computers. Stop with the nonsense! Come on now, it will be undone. - Do we have this frog or whatever? - But you look so funny. Even with being wrong I am still your father, yes? But for the next two days you are also your own son. Now tell me right now what you're up to, Fridolin. You will see. Now activate this Boschi, undo this. It's a spell, don't you understand, Dad? This can't just be undone. It stays like this until the day after tomorrow. Stay here! You don't even know what you're in for as an adult! The work at the court, the stress, the women, the hassle. - How will you do that as a child? - Please manage, Dad. I only want this one wish. Then you won't have to give me anything for Christmas for the next ten years. I'm not stupid to join in with such nonsense. I'll stay here in the apartment, that's that. Fridolin, that surprise! Today it cannot be turned off. Hey, stop it, Fridolin! Dear Lord, let go of the child immediately! Oh dear, are you crazy? You're hurting him! Are you mad? Do we always have to mess around early in the morning like this? - Fridolin, have you been in the bathroom? - I have to pee again. What? I will not be stupid. I am not in a good mood. I've been waiting outside the house for ten minutes. The boy has to go to school, did you forget? Fridolin, have you studied for the math test? Daniel, what's the matter with you? I was only kidding. - So. - What are you wearing? Let's see what the government screwed up again? You? Since when do you read the newspapers? You have to go to school. - This suite is coming off immediately. - Why, Dad gave me as a gift Come now. What videos did you watch last night? If this continues, you can put a lid on joint custody and he will never spend the night with you again. - You don't need the car key! - No, not the car. Not my beautiful car! Fridolin, come now. Come! Just lock yourself in the office and do nothing at all Okay, I will. The shoes are full of shit. Schumi - I'm coming. (F1 driver Michael Schumacher) Good day. Good day. I would like the most expensive flowers you have. I have enough money with me. They are very beautiful, but cost eight marks a piece. Super, I'll take all of them. They are for my mom, who will be very happy when Dad brings her flowers, because he hasn't done that for a long time. Ellie, buckle up! Don't switch off. This is Mozart's Concerto for Piano and Orchestra. Not at all! You heard the Concerto for Piano and Orchestra by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. We wish you further great entertainment. Since when have you been interested in classical music? Always. That was never of interest to you. Pity. I mean, it's a pity that the piece is already over. Mozart just impressed me in music class. You're so weird this morning, Fridolin. You must tell me the truth. I need to know everything for the divorce. It's important, you understand? What was with Daddy? Why divorce? I thought we wanted a separation first. Maybe Daddy wants to marry again. Well, I hadn't actually thought of that. Yes, or I'll find a new partner. How was it? Nice. So nice that you can not imagine. Yes, it is. If he chooses he can be that nice. And funny. I liked it too at first. Very nice even. But this time it was much, much better. Dad is a great guy. I'm blown away by him over and over again. Fridolin, so much nonsense. Do you have a fever? No, no, Mom, it's all right. I'm just looking forward to two nice, relaxing, days at school. Fridolin, your bag. Oh, you're hundredweight. Oh, that's just as heavy as always. - From now on, I'll pick you up afterwards. - Perfect. Hey, Fridolin. Hello there. Katja. Aha. Let's go. Are we going into class? Give me a hard time with your jokes. Fridolin Sternberg. Just because your parents don't care about you, you don't need to vent your pent-up aggression on me. What is that? Not even here at this time. Police! Don't! A burglar has a long knife and wants to threaten my mom with it! - Now calm down! What happened? - A man,... he wants... My mom will be home soon. Where do you live? In the house, just over there. The house with the roof and the window. Tell me, have you had anything to drink this morning? Yes, a cocoa, as always. Now come on, already! My wife is in danger! Come on! Hello. No, you scared me! Sorry about that. What are you doing with the knife? Mommy! Mommy! I mean... Ellie, are you okay? Daniel, what's going on? Where did you come from? Let go of the man immediately. What are you thinking? Your husband says the burglar threatened you with a knife. That's complete nonsense. I have cut slices of mango there. Daniel, what's the nonsense? You know Eric. Oh yes, of course. - Eric... Hello Eric. - Hello. This is Doctor... Eric Martin, my... our dentist. Hi Daniel, yes. Long time no see. So what is our dentist doing at our house? I mean... - Ellie... - Are you completely insane? You know Eric, your school friend. Oh... Yeah. - Oh, sorry, Daniel. I scared you there. - How'd you get in here anyway? That's none of your business. You left me, and I'm doing what I want now. Did you call us only because you don't want your wife to have her lover at home? - Eric is your lover? - Daniel... We should go have a drink sometime. - Is he your lover? - Why are you interested in this? Hold on, sir. Your family matters are not a concern of the police. You will be reported. It's sweet when a man can show his feelings. Alright - I don't care. - Daniel... crying. He hasn't done that since Fridolin was born. So that was it, and when I'm 20, I'll be a rock star in a band like the Dead Pants. That's entirely unlikely. When you're old, are you still going to be jumping around on a stage with green hair? Objection. Preliminary stage. A child can't worry about his pension. What are you saying, Fridolin? I'm only suggesting that you don't take away the children's dreams. I also wanted to become a musician. And guess what? Not a day goes by that I don't imagine how nice it would be to stand on a stage. The spotlights go on. The audience applauds. And I play Mozart. Fridolin, enough of this nonsense! Alex, have a seat. Who takes over the protocol? You see, that's exactly what I mean. Demotivation leads to passive behavior. Oh, this is outrageous! Sternberg. Yes, yes! Sternberg. Didn't you see me? Uh, no. - No? - No. What is... roller skates? Blades. The gate, do you want? Everything all right, yes? How are things at home, Mrs. Wife? Mommy has a lover. What? This is one of your jokes? No, I just found out. Well, you're absolutely right. Sport drives away the gloomy thoughts. I need you to do me a favor. I still have to meet today with my... ... Mayor Election Committee appointment... and... that is, you will have to represent me on this. - What? Me? - Yes. It's only a small construction freeze objection that we're going to approve anyway. No. What? No. I lock myself in the office all day and do nothing. Well, at least you haven't lost your sense of humor. Here it comes. The thing is... When I am mayor I owe you one Good morning, Judge. Good morning, Chief Justice. Good morning, Mrs. Rogge. What is this? - New office? - My office? And that's why you go to school for half your life? Yes, wild pigs in the zoo exercise more. Give a little on Judge Sternberg. Also, he is a little bit confused. His wife left him. Would you like a coffee? Coffee? That doesn't taste good at all. I'll take cocoa. Still free for me there? Hm. Katja, you don't know how harmful smoking is? - What? - I am absolutely against smoking here. You're really, really annoying. Do you all want to die of lung cancer at the age of 20? Hey, you little shit. What do you want? I'm not afraid of you any longer. Hey, don't do that! Put me down right now! Put me down you brats right now! Let go of me! Hey, take it easy! Stop with the foolishness! No! - Yes? - Go! No! What? There is no such thing! Don't go crazy right now. It's just like I'm telling you. That's my father at school. And for two days, I'm sitting here in his office. Put me down right now! Yes. You're always hanging... I'll sue you all you little beasts No, he is me. And I am him. That's great, isn't it? Why? I already thought, you were totally nuts. Your old man is totally acting like a nerd. What? Shit! My reputation is ruined. I'm suing all of you. Give it to me! I need to talk to him right now. Unfortunately that's not possible right now. - Why is he yelling like that? - Oh, it's nothing. He'll calm down, I promise you. Why are you even doing this shit? Because I want to understand my parents better. So that maybe I can bring them back together. But now I have another problem. Mom also has a lover. Wow. I've always thought my parents were crazy. Now you have to eliminate two lovers. But how am I supposed to do that? No idea. I'll ask my older sister who is already 15 and knows about such things. Sternberg, it's 10:45, you need to get to the hearing. Shit, I'm getting hassled again. I'll call you at the long break, okay? Bye. I don't want to work today. I can understand that you are concerned about your wife. But it is only a small case. This building freeze thing. Because of the parking garage on Säbener Straße. Where the skate park is? I think so. Greetings to you, Daniel. Quickly, here. So many people. Rise for the Honorable Judge. Hello. OK. So, here we go. Umm.. Just get started! I'm calling on the case ZZ 13, the company Kaiser Building Construction and Civil Engineering against the City of Munich represented by the Building Department. Honourable Judge On behalf of my clients I demand the lifting of the construction freeze on the site city plan number C5-79. and the immediate issuance of the building permit for the multi-use structure according to the construction plan entry C5. So many difficult words in one sentence, it can give you a headache. So you want to tear down the skate rink and slam a parking garage on top of it? Yes..., I do. But I would like to point out that this complex was built illegally and my clients have generously tolerated this intrusion until now. Do you have children? Yes, but I don't know what -- - And how old are they? - 8 and 11. - But -- - And do they go? - The older one is already. - Really? What's his name? - Sven. - No, not the one who is always sniffling. Yes, my son has a pollen allergy. - How do you know him? - Yes, of course. That's totally crazy. He can double-flip backwards. Well, I don't even know what you're saying. I hope he didn't do anything wrong. No, no, he's totally cool. He's practically a role model for us. For my boy, that is. Thank you, Judge. But you see, my clients have purchased the property legally and according to the tree zoning ordinance may build there. Yes, but why are you slamming the parking garage where the kids can have some fun? I mean... isn't there another place? Our site evaluation process has clearly shown that this site has prime utilization advantages. Do you swear? Swear? Why? Because it totally sucks when you lie. If you lie to me now, you'll grow a really fat, green, ugly nose. So swear by... your mom, dad, husband, kids and... ... canary that there is no other place for the parking garage. Of course, I don't swear to it. I knew it! Well, so..., if that's the case, fine, then I now order them to find another place. What?! But, Judge, may I draw your attention to the fact that in this case -- we have nothing more to say here. - She can't even do the double flip. - The child. On behalf of the people, I order the rejection of the request,... due to non-compliance with the deadlines. Tough luck! You therefore have the right to appeal to the Federal Court of Justice So, that's it. The Court of Justice, that takes years. So? But the chief justice told us that he would turn a blind eye to the deadline. But I have both eyes wide wide open. Give my regards to Sven from Fridolin. OK? Time. - Hi. - Hi. You have given it to Stuppe quite well. You do what you can. Are you waiting for your mom? Yes, I think so. Well then. Well then. Well then. What, then? You always give me a kiss after school. - You want to? - Really. Well? Fridolin. Come quickly. We thought of your favorite restaurant. Hello, Ellie. Ciao, Katja. Hello. OK, it's me. Just think, I saved the skate park. The parking garage will not be built. Yes! Yes! So, did you find out anything? Your father is a great kisser. What?! - Are you crazy? - Yes, he kissed me on the cheek. - Really cool. - You said you'd help me. And now you're making out with my father. Calm down! By the way, I asked my sister, Do you know what a 'macho' is? Oh, well... Me, Really. My sister says no woman can stand such a stupid macho. Maybe that's the only way you can get rid of him. OK. A macho. Can I have my sexy dish? German cream dessert. ... and dessert dishes and...? Where are you? Come on! Hello. Daniel, what are you doing? I wanted to see you. Let's go take a break. We'll be right back. My sweet Nutella slice! What? Come on, I'll take you to dinner at my favorite restaurant. That's nice, but we're... Come on, I'm hungry. I had... A dessert too, eaten by you. This is supposed to be my favorite restaurant? - Hi, Ellie. - Hello. This? Yes Fridolin, long time no see. Well, this is Eric. Daddy's friend from college. He used to be our dentist, remember? Had your first cavity drilled. You bet I know that. Well, you know, I lived in San Francisco for a long time and... I just wanted to see you again. Eric is not only Daddy's friend, but also my friend. I could really use a good friend these days. Maybe you and I can become friends. Does it work like this? Tell me, Eric, didn't you used to have more hair up there? - Fridolin! - Let him be, the boy is right. I have grown older. He'll soon reach puberty, so a little provocation is part of the game. Fridolin, what do you have an appetite for? I want a salad. Great. I also prefer to eat salad. Shall I get us two really great salads? Ellie, Ellie. - Are you crazy? - Even an elephant fits in between. What would you like? One Happy Meal with chicken McNuggets, some fries, and a Coke. And as a toy I would like to have the lizard. I don't have that one yet. Two Big Mac with an extra portion of ketchup, a large french fry, a large Coke, a Mac Flori and... a hot bag. Coming right up. What crawls on the hips? Daniel I didn't realize this was your favorite restaurant. Yes, I come here every time I get enough pocket money from my mommy. Your mom gives you pocket money? Yes, and recently Dad too, so that I don't suffer so much from the separation. That's 24 marks 53, please. - Keep the change. - Thank you. Say, isn't that your wife over there? Um, yeah. This is my wife. - Did you know she was here? - No. - Really, no? - No. This would be a good opportunity to go over and officially introduce ourselves. You've wanted to do that for a long time. Today is not good at all. Why can't I get to know her? She has her lover with her. So what? It's all the better. I didn't know she had a lover. I didn't know until this morning either. What did you expect? That she would sit at home alone and mope around. She is a very attractive... ... woman for her age. That's what I told Dad. Daniel. This whole... separation has made you... ... crazy. I think we should go somewhere after the vernissage so that you can really relax. Oh, yes, super. We will go to the sea. Then the little one can build castles on the beach all day. What little one? Well, Fridolin, who else? - You want to take him? - Of course. After all, I don't want our family to grow up with another father. I'm thinking about taking him full-time anyway. You will surely be a good mommy to him. Uh, Daniel... Don't you think we should discuss such decisions together? I, uh... I like children. If it makes you happy to be with the boy, we can talk about it, and-- Oh! God, what a stupid klutz I am! That's what Mommy said. Mhmm. Tell me, Erik... Do you still have your problems? Excuse me? As before. At the university in Giessen, when all the girls ran away from you. - Ellie, you've never hit your child! - I'm sorry. I'm really sorry about that, but... Fridolin, what are you saying? A big boy like you can easily take a little nudge like that. Shit. I have to pee. - Hi Ines! - Fridolin! - What're you doing here? - You won't believe what happened. Let me finish. I am your boyfriend. Fridolin, now let go of me, please! Are you insane? Leave the child alone. Leave the child alone from me. You have to forgive the boy, he is going through a very difficult time right now. What happened to him that was so bad? His father ran off with a very bad slut. Do you know what your son did? He wanted to get into my pants. What? That was great! He only does that when he totally likes someone. Daniel, I've had enough. I hope you'll be back to normal at the vernissage tonight. Don't forget the sculpture. Let's go. - But what about Fridolin? - No, nothing. Well Ellie, good luck with the presentation but I'm sure you'll succeed. Thank you. I hope you are right. Really, it's time for a sense of achievement again. See you soon. Thank Eric for the food, Fridolin. Thank you, Eric. Please, you're welcome. So, living under the same roof with you guys, it's gonna be fun. - Pardon? - Come now, Fridolin. What a suck-up. Good day. Please excuse the delay. And this is my son, Fridolin. I promise you he will behave. Hello, Fridolin. Very pleasant. Yes, maybe you'd like to sit back there, and draw something? While your mom presents us her ideas. Draw something? Well, if you say so. Good luck, Ellie. Yes. So, ladies and gentlemen... The main building for the Federal Garden Show... should, in my opinion..., be the... reflect man's longing for the untouched paradise. Security..., peace and harmony with oneself and nature. Sternberg. Have you gone insane? If you lie to me now, you'll grow a green nose. What did you want to achieve with that? The parking garage must be built, otherwise I can't become mayor. Then you can go ahead and get a big Band-Aid. What? When the big ones can't skate anymore, there will be a huge fight. Other men also run away from their wives, but don't go immediately crazy. Pull yourself together and express yourself more precisely, please. Why Dario, for example, is a super skater who has five brothers and twelve cousins. You have to be very careful that they find you cool and leave you alone. There you are! Those are pretty big families, right? And they all stick together. Families. They have three. We need the voices of families. The vast majority of which I am ashamed to have been cut. You're a genius, Sternberg! And I am a stupid, foolish,... ... blind oaf. Now I also understand your roller blades... ... excuse me. - Skates. - Skates. Think of the voters. We love children. Thank you, Sternberg, for opening my eyes. For the child, the park, of course, should not be demolished. I forbid it! Get to work on it right away. The main building will be the centerpiece in the form of a shell. Inside, on a lattice mesh, blue and white climatic roses and hydrangeas will grow upwards. This natural planting creates a space full of wonderful scents and aromas. Thank you for your attention. Did you discuss the design of the single lattice with the architects of the shell? Not directly, but I don't think that will be a problem. But you did not contact them? No. So we don't know what their position is on this proposal? No, but I mean it was clear that greenery was desired. I mean why else did you advertise for bids among garden architects? Did it say in the competition documents that you were to contact the architects? No, I do not think so. Then it does not matter for the contract award. Fridolin? You're a very bright person. At your age I was still playing with the trains. You know, my father works at the courthouse, so you hear a lot of things. I'm sure, knowing my mom,... she will contact the architects immediately. Thank you. Hey, that's alcohol. I can't eat another ice cream. I also have to watch my weight. Fridolin? Today we have to celebrate. Hm? After this order, we'll get another one. And then another. We'll earn our own money and won't have to ask Dad for anything in the future. We are free and independent, Fridolin. As if that's so important. That is important. For me, this is important. You know, when you're abandoned, you kind of lose your confidence. And... then such experiences of success are especially important. Is Eric important to you, too? Yes. How long has it been going on between you? Fridolin, I don't recognize the way you've been talking to me lately. You know, I called Eric when your dad told me, that he loves another woman. Dad hurt me very much. And if Erik hadn't cheered me up a little from time to time, I'm sure I would have been much sadder. And I certainly didn't want that, because I don't want my son to grow up with a sad mom. There, look here. - Thanks a lot. - You're welcome! What's it gonna be, little one? Why do you call me little? I'm not calling you fat. You're right. So, my boy, what will it be? I'm making two saiblings today, the likes of which my wife has never eaten. Maybe you should take trout instead. Trout usually taste better to children. What tastes good to me, my dear, is still up to me. And then I would need lemon and sage. Ah, white wine, Chablis and... champagne. What were you thinking? Do you have 100 marks for that little bit of fish? I am still dependent on your father. I have not yet earned a mark myself. But I just wanted to cook for you. Why all of a sudden? And since when can you buy anything? Dad taught me that. I was thinking because you were so sad about Dad. We'll have a nice and relaxing evening to talk about what has been going on lately. You, look. Great look! Thanks. And you did a great job. Such a beautiful table. Do you have a new perfume? How thoughtful you've been since Dad left. He never would have noticed. Oh. - Why do you need a third plate? - Eric is coming over. Again? I thought we'd have a nice evening together tonight. Fridolin. I can understand that you have to get used to Eric first. But you're bound to like him very soon. I don't want to be always alone myself. I mean, I'm not alone because you're here. But I also want to have a grown-up by my side. Dad also has Ines. So that's why you dressed up like that. I did that for myself too, my jealous little Sicilian. Oh, hold on. Yes. Daniel. You look... good. Yes, thanks. You look good too, my bundle of joy. This is Dr. Sternberg. Gerd Trucker, our artist. - Pleased to meet you. - Good day, Mr. Trucker. Yep. Sneak a glass of wine, sweetie? We just sold your painting for 20,000 marks. 20.000! Yes. You can buy a whole skating rink for that. You just don't have to be so witty when I talk to you. Did you bring the sculpture? Logically. This tastes excellent. A really good day today! I always told you that you could do it on your own. - Why were you so sure about that? - Because you're good. You just worry too much. That's what Dad used to say. But there was always trouble. He didn't mean it. He just said that so he wouldn't have to listen to my problems to begin with. He also had to earn the rent. Fridolin, stop it now. And don't spoil my good mood. Ellie, the boy is right after all. Fridolin, your daddy is all right. However I always doubted he would ever be cut out to be a responsible family man. Yeah, why not? Because I've known him for a long time. And the students, we did some pretty wild things. I honestly don't believe that Ines was the only one within your marriage. You, another piece of veggies? You wouldn't mind if I said good night for this evening? This conversation is not very appropriate for children. I'm going to bed. Don't. Everyone wants the sea bar now, he wants to go into production. We might make a lot of money, Daniel. Thanks, Fridolin. Come on, it's time. I can do the same You don't believe that slimeball, do you? - What do you mean? - There was not another woman in... ... your marriage. Ines was the only one. And how would you know that, of all things? Dad told me. - Is he talking to you about his affairs? - Nonsense! What happened to us, Ellie? A lot happened. But you'll see, Fridolin, everything will be all right again. Good night sleep. So, something must be happening to the boy to become a complete mess. Yeah. Fridolin is a... ... unusual child. You're not still aroused? You can't live like a nun just because of the little one. I don't intend to. But he's too distraught right now. It's as if he is trying to imitate his father. Maybe he thinks that's what I'm asking of him. Purely psychologically, of course. You know what? I'm going to go up and have a man-to-man talk with him. OK. Yes. Fridolin. Good night. Good night. So? Oh, Ellie. Don't worry. In a few minutes he'll be sound asleep. You need to think about yourself for a change. If you're not careful, you will get cold. Quick, give me your blouse. Oh, right! Come on, every second counts! Somebody should figure you out. There's nothing underneath it today. Come on, hurry up! This is an emergency. Although many are not worried, I will put you down in a safe place. Good now. Yes. Now run. Yeah, you like it there, don't you? I've had enough I want to go home. Hold on. It's showtime! Fridolin... - ... for God's sake, are you hurt? - No. Now, that's enough for me. I've had it! You apologize to Eric immediately! I will not. I'm going to Dad's. Then you'll have the house to yourselves. I'll call a taxi. - Can you advance me a 20? - You're staying here! ... and apologize. There is no need for that. I think it's an excellent idea for the boy to stay with his dad tonight. I don't know what to do anymore. Have you ever thought about boarding school? Good evening. Evening. Come here, little one. A beer and a clear one. And if you had a glass of milk for the little one? Coming right up. Daddy? - Hm? - Did you really make out with Katja? How do you know that? Katja? Is that how you know? Of course. She's my girlfriend, after all. She helps me. And? - Did you? - Oh nonsense, kid. The girl is exaggerating wildly. Like all women. But the girl is cute. - Do you like her? - A little bit. Oh, I don't understand all the fuss about women. It's never too early to ask yourself that. They are crazy. All. True? Everyone has their own experiences. Hey! Hey! Cheers. But Mommy is not crazy. You should have seen them today, at the presentation. She had her diamond eyes again. Whenever she talks about her flowers, her eyes start to sparkle. That's the way she used to look at me. So why did the sparkle stop? Why? Because of everyday life. I learned something very important today, Fridolin. What? The thing with the separation. I did not do that well. I was only thinking of myself. Tomorrow evening, when all this is over, I'll have a quiet talk with Mom. I didn't realize how much I was hurting her and you. And for that I'm really sorry. Great. So then you talk to each other again. I also solved the problem with Ines. - What have you done? - You're rid of her. Fridolin, Ines is a great girl. She doesn't like hedgehogs. A hedgehog, my God, it is! Yes, it' s no longer completely right. My beautiful blouse is also ruined. Just be happy you finally got a guy who doesn't constantly get into your pants. My Steffen would probably have driven over this poor animal. I actually think... the man is not really interested in me at all. He's really... ... a child. Don't you see? The wedding bells are already ringing. Hello? This is a marriage proposal. - What? - Yes. His behavior just shows... that he no longer sees you as his lover for the quick number in the car, but as his... ... life partner, who is the mother of his future children. Well, yes. He wants to go on vacation with his son and me. See? Men can never say what they think. They are simply raised by their mothers to be too uptight. Then I was... completely out of line! Sleep well my little one. Everything will be okay again tomorrow evening? Yes, sleep well, Daddy. You're a great son, Fridolin. I'm very proud of you. You're also the best daddy. From the last beer, oh,... ... what's in it. Fortunately, there is no gymnastics today. No! Fridolin! Daddy, why are you yelling like that? A woman! I would never have thought that of you! With my own son! A woman touched me. It never goes away. Did you do it? What? - Done what? - Well, just... ... you know. A woman kissed me. If this is another marriage proposal, my answer is no, once and for all. - Did you look at me? - My Ines, it is a misunderstanding. I can explain everything to you tonight. A woman. It's totally perverse. Never tell the other guys. Don't worry, I've got you. But so... You can't go to work. After all, I also have a reputation to lose. So, Fridolin. What have you prepared for project day? I have something very special. I would like for you and my classmates... ... to sing a song. Dude, are you crazy? You suck at singing. Alex, a guitar. Play to chord G3. This is the one you know. Well, all right, Fridolin, but... ... no longer than a minute. ♪ I see our teacher, Mrs. Stoppelberg, back there. ♪ ♪ We don't care about math homework. ♪ ♪ We skate when we feel like it. ♪ ♪ When school is out, I'm going to get... ♪ ♪ ... a kiss from Katja. ♪ ♪ If you do what you want, you will accomplish what you should. ♪ ♪ Don't pull your head in right away, a ring like that is worth more than gold. ♪ ♪ Alex on the guitar, Fridolin with the microphone. ♪ ♪ When you party with us, put your hands up and shout. ♪ ♪ Come on guys, join in a little bit. ♪ ♪ Move your butts, give yourselves a kick. ♪ ♪ Everything will be fine if you do what you can't help doing. ♪ ♪ Join in a little bit. I want to hear the whole class. ♪ ♪ Come on guys, join in a little bit. ♪ ♪ Move your butts, give yourselves a kick. ♪ ♪ Everything will be fine if you do what you can't help doing. ♪ ♪ Join in a bit, I want to hear the whole class.♪ ♪ Come on guys, join in a little bit. ♪ ♪ Move your butts, give yourselves a kick. ♪ ♪ Everything will be fine if you do what you can't help doing. ♪ ♪ Join in a bit, I want to hear the whole class. ♪ ♪ Come on guys, join in a little bit. ♪ ♪ Move your butts, give yourselves a kick. ♪ ♪ Everything will be fine if you do what you can't help doing. ♪ ♪ Join in a bit, I want to hear the whole class. ♪ Great number, dude. But why can you suddenly sing so well? Are you taking drugs? Nonsense. You just keep progressing. But if you want, I'll show you some new moves on the guitar. I think there's real talent there. You could improve your music scores a lot. Are you really a trainer? Yeah, great. Hello Ellie... uh... Mommy. Why did you get out? Fridolin. Could you take the bus today for a change? I want to talk to your teacher some more. That'll let you skip a class for sure. OK. Come on, let's go. Yes, please. Good day. Thank you, Manuel You may go now. Goodbye, Mrs. Stuppe. Bye. Please take the chair. Yes, thanks. And thank you for taking extra time. Yes, no problem. That's what I'm here for. So... The separation from my husband has been very hard on Fridolin. Oh. I didn't notice any of that here. Fridolin is more ambitious and eager than ever before. Oh yeah? That makes me happy, of course. Yes, I'm surprised too, Fridolin was never an overachiever. On the contrary, he was always the class clown. Now he is so responsible and cares about his classmates. Then perhaps my question will surprise you. Ask. What would you think if we put Fridolin in a boarding school? I would hate to lose him. It is as if... ... he had matured by years overnight. His musical abilities have developed in no time and his... social behavior is impeccable. He inherited the music talent from his father. People wanted to become musicians then. I'm very attached to the little one. It's not easy for me to give him away. I would be just as happy if he stayed with us. However... I would advise an IQ test. So we don't miss anything and Fridolin gets bored in the class. The possibility of giftedness exists and then... a boarding school might be interesting after all, where he can grow up among other highly gifted people. If you feel the same way, then... Well, I'll talk to Fridolin about it. Yes. Thanks, Mrs Stuppe. Gladly. - Schmidt. - Yes? this is how you do the curve. Hello, Miss Sternberg. Good day, sir. Sorry for the intrusion. It doesn't matter. That is a beautiful thought. Hey, do you have a moment? Yeah, yeah. I know your friend Ines is younger, but you shouldn't overdo it with your youthfulness. OK. So, it's about Fridolin... Oh, yes? And? His teacher believes that he is highly gifted. ... and that he can no longer be sufficiently stimulated in his class. What? I expect you to accept my decision. And support Fridolin. Yes, of course. What decision? Fridolin will be sent to a boarding school. Now say something. After all, he's your son, too. Only child in boarding school. You want to... put your own son in a boarding school because of a strange man? I know what you are. You are a very bad mommy. Daniel. Yes, you're crying again. Why didn't you show your feelings like this even once during our marriage? A boarding school is out of the question. I will fight for compensation law. It's called custody. And that definitely stays with me. I don't want him to have to live with you and your mistress. But none of those exist anymore. Whether her name is Ines or Dagmar, there will always be someone. You can't be faithful, Daniel. Eric said that too. I don't care what he says. I am not going to a boarding school. I'm not talking about you, you egotist, I'm talking about your son. I will inform you of the boarding school I have chosen. - Goodbye. - Goodbye! Fridolin. I need to talk to you. - What are you doing? - Not much. I'm doing the math for all the homework through the end of the year. - Since when do you like to do math? - It's a piece of cake. Now, Fridolin, listen. Eric and I, we have a surprise for you. We are going on a trip to a very beautiful place. Oh, no, not today I'm going to Dad's. I made a deal with him. But we've already prepared everything. Impossible, I cannot. I must actually go to dad. I have to go see him in six hours. And not one second later. We'll be back long before then. I will not let the Mayor... take away our children's vested freedoms. I give you thanks, Bishop. We will fight with all means against the construction of this parking garage. Skate, yes. Parking garage, no! Yes. Oh! Oh! Fridolin, join us! Huh? Oh! Hey! Up, Fridolin. Come on. Fridolin. What's the matter? My dad, you never laughed so much. Oh come on, I haven't really laughed for so long. It's nice here after all. The three of us together. Almost like a real family. Dad and you are my family. And besides, Dad told me that he wants to talk to you again about everything Morning. I think he has doubts about whether he did everything right with the separation. Fridolin, I told you to stay out of this. Guess what I found? - Right or left? - That one. Blueberries! Fresh blueberries. They were actually for Fridolin. No. I lost my appetite long ago. So we have to go now. It's already getting dark. Don't tell stories. Fridolin. Come with me. We didn't want to show you this beautiful place just because of the pond. How come? See that castle over there? It is the best and most beautiful boarding school far and wide. So what? Look, you need a stable and calm living environment right now. Things have gotten a little mixed up at our house. Well,... I thought that maybe it wouldn't be so bad for now if you went to boarding school. What?!? You want to get rid of your kid, Ellie? I would never have thought that of you. But sure, sure. I mean, you're back at work and you have a new lover. A child is just a nuisance. So away with it! Oh, nonsense. I just thought I'd show you. I'm not forcing you to do anything. You alone decide. But Mrs. Stuppe thinks you need the best support possible, because you are exceptionally talented. What am I? No, definitely not. That will change again soon, believe me Ellie. Oh, let's take a look at it. Today is open house. And in the evening the magnificent school choir sings the Vienna Boys' Choir. Maybe you want to become one of them. Mrs. Stuppe said that you've been enjoying singing lately. No, definitely not, and especially not today. I have to go to Dad's house in exactly... ... four hours and 22 minutes. We certainly have the choice. Great work. - Bye, dear friend. - Bye. - What is it? - You've got to have that down. Oh, I see. Be good. This place is just fantastic. How did you find it? What should you do when you're single, alone on Sundays? On the one hand you want to get out, on the other there are only families everywhere. Makes you feel kind of lonely. Well, that's when I decided that every Sunday... ... to hike to a very special place. Then, as of today, this is our place, so to speak. Where is Fridolin anyway? No idea. Fridolin! - Fridolin! - Get out! Sorry Ellie, but, it has to be done. Attention, there is work. Dark blue jeep with Munich license plate. Come. Sorry, I am a kid. I can do anything. Bye, friends. That's me. You saw me. Hello? Mrs. Steinberg! What are you doing here? My son took off in our car. But he can't even drive yet. Is this another one of your family affairs? I swear it's an emergency. Please help us. Let's go. Hop on. Go home now. Have a good evening. Oh, yes. Bye, Mrs. Rose. And Merry Christmas. I'm going back to school tomorrow. All the best! That's why I have a dog and not a husband. Oh, no! Now of all times! Don't tell me this guy is too stupid to fill up the car with gas? Good evening, gentlemen. I know it may sound crazy, but... I have to go home, otherwise I'll remain a child. Get out fast. Please enter the code. Code? What kind of code? - Oh, shit. - Please enter the code. Fridolin! Fridolin. Fridolin, my God! What are you doing? I love you so much. Why are you doing that? Ellie, listen to me I have my reason. But now we have to go to dad's apartment immediately. It's vital. I'm not Fridolin. I'm Daniel. That is, I am your husband, Daniel. But put in Fridolin's body. So I have to go back to my apartment immediately so that the computer Boschi can undo it. Fridolin, come to your senses. You don't have to replace Dad for me. You're my son. And that's all I want from you. Now, Mrs. Sternberg, I think you need to see a family psychologist. I don't believe this! So I'm going to say something to prove it, something that only you and I can know. So... It is... About... Your father is a pervert! Sharing our deepest secrets. He's sick. He's totally sick. I have to protect you from him. I'll file a complaint in the morning. Always seemed a bit strange to me. Have I not noticed anything all these years? I need to go home, please! We're going straight to your father, and I'm going to tell him something. Yeah, good idea. But then we have to hurry. We only have 45 minutes left. Hello? This is not it. Daddy. Daddy, pick up the phone! Fridolin, where are you? I can't do it anymore Fridolin, please stop! Lie down for a while, I'll make the tea. My God, Fridolin. You play like... ... your father. Exactly the same. Man, Ellie, I am my father. Now will you believe me? But... Where is he if you...? I don't know either, Ellie. All I know is that we're shitty parents. If the boy isn't here in seven minutes, I'll stay your son. Katja. Katja, what luck! Listen, you have to help me. I'm here in the courthouse, I'm still stuck in the elevator. You have to go to daddy. He needs to get on the computer, on the Internet. But quickly! - OK, I'm on my way. - Yeah. OK. Thanks. How... How did this transformation happen? Fridolin said something about a... ... computer Boschi. I've always been against this shit. Maybe I'll find something in the memory. Show! No, where are you? Hey, who are you? Where is he,... Little Fridolin? Time is running out. Have you cast a spell on us? Of course. But where is Fridolin? We don't know either. Oh, dear! Problem! Problem! I told you right away, this is a dangerous spell! Without Fridolin, I can't change you back. What? Uh... Mr. Boschi you must... -- Just simply Boschi to me. Boschi, you must help us! We know we've made mistakes. But we want to make things right again. It's too late for that now! Boschi, please. We will do everything to make Fridolin happy. I can't help you even if I wanted to. The child who made the wish must also be here, otherwise I can't reverse the spell. Sorry. I think on the Internet, it doesn't matter where you are anymore. But then the other person has to be on the internet too. Come on, Boschi, wait for me. Where are you? We have only twelve seconds left. - No. - No. Welcome children -- No, I don't want to stay big! I haven't had my childhood yet. No! No! No! Another eight years of school and then university. I can't do it. No friends, first time having sex. Oh, no. This can't be true. Even in this situation, he thinks only of himself. Hello, Fridolin. You've made quite a mess here. I know I'm late, but I'm stuck here in the elevator. Fridolin! Are you OK? - Hello Katja. - Hello. He is talking to Fridolin. Fridolin, where are you? He can't hear you, you have to email him now. - Who are you? - I'm Katja. Fridolin's girlfriend. The real Fridolin's. Why are you here? Fridolin called me so that I could help you. Yes, thank you. But you're too late. What? Why is that? The time run out. - Every kid has one wish, right? - Yes. So I have one too? Yes, of couse. Then I wish that Fridolin becomes Fridolin again and his daddy becomes daddy again. But then you've used up your wish. After all, what are friends for? Isn't that right, Mr. Sternberg? Katja, you are the greatest! Everyone seems to know more than I do. So, friends, here we go. After all, I don't have all night. Oh! Oops! - Mommy! - Fridolin! Fridolin! That was probably a bit much. Well, then I want to move on. Find other children who need me. Oh yeah! No, nobody believes this. Thank you, Katja. That was really great of you. I would have been so sad if Fridolin hadn't been a child anymore. And besides... Imagine if he had to go to work every day. And that at his age. Fridolin is my true friend. Fridolin! Daddy! Daniel! Boy! Boy! Boy! Katja. Think we owe you something. You don't think this is a happy ending or anything, do you? No, that would really be too easy. My parents messed up way too much for that. I didn't realize it at the time because I was much too small. And besides, the world is always a beautiful place when you're a child. The first thing I did as a kid again was to restore my bad reputation at school. And then, after all, I did it, Dad and Mom are talking to each other again without fighting all the time. At the moment, they are even considering if maybe they really did break up too quickly. We still have two apartments, but Dad has already spent two nights at our house again this week. On the guest couch. And honestly, now, that I get all this and they can stop being so secretive, I could even go on living like this. With two families, I mean. Boschi says There are so many different types of families today. Children who live only with their mom or with their dad and are still perfectly happy. You can see Boschi has come back and I don't know what to do without him anymore. Because whenever I have a problem, he knows what to do. By the way, if you also want to visit Boschi, just give it a try. Ha, ha, ha! Bye! Subtitle by DreamScape and Alf Capone
