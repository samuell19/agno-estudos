They must have started from the temple. Why is it taking so long? Shall I go and check? The married couple has arrived. Come on. Welcome. Dear... this Hundiyal is our heritage. Back in those days, when the kings paid my grandpa for weaving silks for them... he saved those in this Hundiyal. Every year during the temple festival... this Hundiyal is opened and the money is taken out... and is distributed to employees, who work for us and their families. My grandmother passed it to my mother. My mother passed it on to her. Now, you are the new daughter-in-law in family. This belongs to you. Sharadha, give it to her. Here, take it dear. Ganesa... This auspicious deed must not stop with me. It must carry on to our future generations. Okay, dear father-in-law. To be happy, keep everyone around us happy. -Bless us. -God bless you. God bless you. God! It's a boy. But... we couldn't save the mother. Oh my God! Mother! Sir! Sir! My dear Sharadha! Dhanam, are you still rocking a three year old in a cloth cradle? When are you planning for a child of your own? Mom, stop talking unnecessarily. Yeah right! Even the head of this family won't advice you on all this. Unnecessary? I am just stating the fact. Mom, quiet please. Father-in-law might hear you. Let him hear. Sir... Ganesa... no matter what... you must have your own heir. Only then you'll have a hold on life. Look who's talking. Uncle... -Sir, I need a help. -What is it? I've finalized a small shop in Madras. It was suggested by my brother-in-law. He said, he'll run the shop. I know who'd have told you all this. Dad, why do you keep talking about the child? I'm visiting here only once in a week. Why do you keep pestering me with the same topic? Half of my salary is spent on my trip up and down. On top of that, he spends lavishly as if we have lot of wealth. Spending on God and temple! What can we do with the remaining earnings? Child is the last thing we need! If anyone brings up the child topic again... I'll stop visiting here! Ask him. Sir... He is naive and spoke out of haste. You don't worry. But he has a point, right? My daughter is already going to school. But look at Ganesan, who was my classmate. It's not like he doesn't want a child. Money, sir. Money! In these modern times, no one can survive without money. Sir... I have an idea, may I? Anyway we are going to buy sarees for my shop. I shall buy it from your weaving house. You weave it for us. I shall pay you instead of paying someone else. Our generation on weaves sarees for deities. Don't you know that Chandru? Didn't we weave it for kings, back in those days? Sir, anyone with money today is a king. I just spoke my heart because I thought I had the right. Don't mistake me. Think harder and give me a positive reply. Dear sister... no matter what, it feels like we are betraying him. I don't have a good feeling. Brother, I can see that he's naive and not so smart. Why do we have to follow him? My husband gave you his word, right? Just do it, brother. We too deserve to be rich. Here you go, sir. -What is it? -Don't know. Ganesa... Where did you get so much money? We have taken a new order for weaving. We are going to sell sarees from our weaving house. Why all of a sudden, dad? It's all for you, my children. Now, start a new life dear. Bless us. Sir, here you go. -Hundiyal? -Now, put money in it. -Mom, come. I am hungry. -What is it? I have kept some cookies in the hall for you. Can you go and eat by yourself? Mom, come with me. Please, dear. Mom? She's your sister-in-law. No! She's my mother. I say she's your sister-in-law and he calls you mom! He's calling you mom, does that mean... - your son must call him brother? -Stop it, mom. Remember, you are Siva's uncle! Uncle! Uncle, please help me open this tiffin box. Please, come on now! Come again? Uncle? Come with me! How many times have I told you? Stop calling me uncle! That's how grandpa asked me to address you. Grandpa will say so but what did mom tell you? Didn't she ask you to treat me as your brother? Not mom. She is your sister-in-law, uncle. I'm your brother. No, uncle. I'm your brother. No, you're my uncle. I am your brother! Guess what, Fathima! Murugan is Siva's uncle it seems! Uncle! Uncle! Look! It's all acting! It's all acting! He is so wicked that he'll commit a murder and cry for the victim! Come on, he's a kid. Don't talk like that about him. Don't call him a kid! Look here! A little below and he'd have lost an eye. Everyone around me are fraudsters! You fraud! You'll also grow up to be a fraud like Chandrasekhar! Stop hitting him, dad. Leave him. You got fooled by Chandru and you're showing the anger on him? Don't direct the anger on somebody else to him. Aren't you idle since the weaving house has been shut? Ain't I running the family here? I'll take care of him. All of you come to Chennai with me. Come again? You want us to leave the place where we are the masters... and go outside and be slaves? Say that again. You think being a master will fill your tummy? -Stop being foolish, dad. -Dear... -don't talk to him like that. -Dad, don't scold grandpa. Or else I'll shoot you. Yeah! Keep saying this! Stay here and rock in that swing with your grandpa forever. Dear brother, please take me with you. I hate the school here... I hate my friends... and I also don't like dad. Fine, don't cry. Don't cry. Come to Chennai with me. I'll take care of you. Go ahead... Leave... He will grow up and take care of you all. I will raise my grandson like a king! Do you want to see it? Challenge! This is Varadharajan's challenge! God! You became jobless because after you challenged Chandrasekhar! And now you make a challenge involving my son? Dear Siva, grandpa is here for you. Siva, I am going to Madras. There's a huge beach over there. There are lot of hotels and theaters there. I am going to have an awesome fun time there. Hope you have a tough time here. Okay, uncle. Hope you remember what grandpa said. I shall grow up and take care of you all. This is Sivakumar's challenge! Challenge! SIVAKUMARIN SABADHAM (SIVAKUMAR'S CHALLENGE) Sir... Come, let's go in. Wait. Let's wait for Siva. What? For Siva? -He went for thread purchase already. -No. On Mani's order, he went to get those threads inked. He finished that already. He went to deliver the sarees. Sir, let him come at his own time. We can't wait until then. Auspicious time is about to get over. Let's open the Hundiyal and distribute the money. Don't you know that my grandson always live up to his words? He promised he'll be here. He'll definitely reach on time! Okay, sir. Now, who is that Siva? I am so curious to meet him! Well, I'll give his introduction. Owning a Bullet is the trend in the village... but he took a loan and purchased a Dio bike ! Now Dio has a huge seat yet he sits on the edge of it. Even in a packed traffic... he drives like it's a high way because he says "That's my way!" He gives a damn and cruises along beating the traffic! Not just that! Shirts exist in many colours... but he wears a single shirt with all colours in it! Beach shirt and skinny pant; that's his style. With a butterfly hairstyle... and a man bun that he colours once in a while! There's more! Creates trouble all around, that's his lifestyle! Just when their parents had given up hope on many guys here... he considers all the guys in this village as his own brothers! That guy who's storming down like a style icon... that's our Sivakumar! "Obviously!" "Neither on the top or the bottom! We are always the center piece" "Nothing can pull us down, because we are the middle class" "We are always swag and our hype never lags" "Well our pockets are empty because money never stays with us" "Middle class, dude! That's what we are!" "Always cool and swag! We will never fall!" "Middle class, dude! That's what we are!" "Always cool and swag! We will never fall!" "We always go with the flow" "Remember nothing is permanent in this world" "Day in and day out, it's always a war all along" "Yet we, the middle class, stay bold and strong" "We lose ourselves working multiple shift" "But after work we happily exist" "We don't need anyone to talk us up" "No! Thank you!" "At least once in our life we'll win for sure" "Month end budget issues? You'll only find it in the middle class" "Month end budget savings? You'll only find it in the middle class" "We treat sorrow like the dust" "Buddy, we are the middle class! Yeah, that's us!" "We treat sorrow like the dust" "Buddy, we are the middle class! Yeah, that's us!" "We are the middle class! Yeah, that's us!" "Always cool and swag. Our hype never lags!" "No matter how hard the hurdles are, we will overcome them" "We make use of the discounts and act like we paid a bomb" "Neighbour's wi-fi is what our mobile runs on" "We always pray to God for everyone" "Obviously!" "Livin' la vida loca!" "We make adjustments even in our footwear, for it to last long" "We roam around, brave and strong!" "Month end budget issues? You'll only find it in the middle class" "Month end budget savings? You'll only find it in the middle class" "Middle class, dude! That's what we are!" "Always cool and swag! We will never fall!" "Middle class, dude! That's what we are!" "Always cool and swag! We will never fall!" -The blue looks better. -That looks good, right? Take that saree. It's seems they belong to a royal family. They are you ready to pay up to Rs. 3 lakhs for a saree. But they want sarees in that exact quality like the one there. I have brought sarees based on the designs he sent. Hopefully they will like it. Madam's here. Greetings. -Greetings. -It's okay. Be seated. Sir, check if this is what madam is looking for. Please show them. None of these. These all are waste. All these look very similar... but none of those match this. Please, have it. Sir, but I got all the exact designs you had sent me. I have few more. Listen... this is "Rajapattu" It's a vintage classic. 100s of year's heritage. What's the lifetime of these sarees? Five years? -Sir, five to six years, definitely. -Confirm. But this will last for 50 years. 50 years? Look here... my mother draped that saree on her wedding. I draped the same "Rajapattu" for my wedding. For generations we have been exclusively draping this "Rajapattu" It's been 20 years since we settled in Dubai. Now we're here for my daughter's wedding and we're looking for "Rajapattu"... but you say it's not made anymore. It's true, madam. There's no one weaving this silk for the last 20 years. In fact, we can say that it's extinct. Some vintage classic collectors... do a resale of these sarees. We help the business get done. You'll be lucky if you find one. Why don't you try and see if you can find it? Sir, we shall try and definitely find out. They don't have it now, madam. What's up, Kathir? -Sit, buddy. -Why are you blocking the entrance? They didn't show any mercy on this innocent and tore my vest! You can spit on my face later. You must thrash those guys who thrashed me. You must have done some fraud for extra commission. Buddy... I agree that I commit fraud. But I didn't get thrashed for commission, today. It was for our Kanchipuram! For our Kanchipuram? Yes, buddy. In this shop... they are mixing hand and machine woven sarees. So, I directed the customer to a better shop. That's why they thrashed me and... Kathir... People come to Kanchipuram believing they will get good quality silk sarees. So... a black mark on Kanchipuram is a black mark on us, right? -Indeed! -Isn't it? -Fire! Fire! -Must fight situation! -Here I go! -Yes! I thought you'll go in but where are you off to? It's lunch time. Let's eat and then deal this. Go ahead and eat. See you. But before that hear what I got to say. The shop owner spoke ill about your grandpa. -How dare he speak ill of my grandpa? -He was abusing him. I knew it. I must have used this trump card first. Buddy, I know you so well! Dude, not just your grandpa! Guess what he said about your great grandpa... Kathir, show me the guy who spoke ill of my grandpa. The owner is not here now. Fine, let's go then. But they are the one who thrashed me. That predator like looking guy! Do you want more thrashings? Who is he? Your saviour? Come on... My friend. He's so upset that you thrashed him. Apologize and he'll calm down. Apologize? No way! See that? He refuses to apologize. Let's go. I won't say sorry instead I'll give you both a saree. Drape them. See that, guys? Welcome to Mr. Butterfly Hairstyle's show! Come again? Delivering punch line? Stop dancing and run! He started dancing, so you guys better run! Damn it! Buy one, get one free. Here comes another one. Attack him! Girls! Girls! Coolers! Coolers! Dude, why? That's not the way to do it. First, fight! Okay. How dare you raise hands on me? No one can touch me in Kanchipuram until my buddy is with me. Now, why are you back? Why are you back now? Do you want more thrashings? Damn, he's talking my lines without understanding the situation. He's charged up. You better run or he'll beat you to pulp. -Who is he? -You don't know him? Wait and watch, he'll come! Dude, don't wear the coolers. Well, your job is not complete yet. He is the owner. The guy who spoke ill about grandpa. He's hurt and yet he's staring at us! Come on, you also stare down at him! I said stare at him, not to look at him. Teach me how to stare and I'll do that. I must teach you everything. Show anger on your face! Lift your eyebrow! Now let your eye do the talking! Let your nose breathe fire! Pump the fire out! Why is there no reaction change? What's is he doing? God! Dude, what are you doing? Didn't you ask me to stare at him? I said stare not to make poop-face! Get lost! You just don't like anything I do. If you do it like I say then I'll like it! That's it! That' the correct look! Stare down at him like this! Come on! Come on! Stare at him! You shut up! What's with the stare? Sir, he asked me to do it. Me? Sir... I asked him to stare at that man. Fine, come here. Sir... What's all this? Why is it shaved on the side? Looks so indecent! Sir, this is the most decent you can see him. What? Last month he had different colors on each side of his head. He had colored his hair like rainbow, sir! Even I gave him a nickname "Rainbow Rooster" remember buddy? Yes, sir. Right from childhood he's like that. He gives people awesome nicknames. When we came here, I told him you look like Walter Vetrivel. He said "This guys? Looks like Mr. Turkey Face" Sir, whatever it is, make sure we both are together. Else he'll frame me for everything. -Please, sir. -Get up! Get up. Stop your drama. Or else he'll charge you under section 420 - fraud. Who are they? They are doing too much! They are our very own local guys. They are nice and genuine. They are regular here. Ravi... I'm in a mood to teach today. Get the guys ready. Dude, class for only boys or is it co-education? What does he mean by he's in the mood to teach? Are you guys taking tuition classes in here? Try to understand the seriousness of the issue. Looks like the issue will blow out of proportion. Wait, I'll ask your grandpa to come here. -Please don't call my grandpa. -Shut up! What if it becomes a serious issue? You call him. Did I speak too early? Sir... please come. Sir. Please come. Grandpa is so angry that he might set the station ablaze. Look, he's tweaking his moustache,buddy. Who are you? How dare you ask that? Are you new here? You're in Kanchipuram and don't you know who is Varadharajan sir? Sir, you have a seat. Greetings. I am Varadharajan. You have arrested my grandson. Let him out. He roughed up the owner of garment shop and that too in his shop! He didn't hit the wrong person. He hit the person who did wrong. Kanchipuram is famous for silks. There is a rich heritage for those silks. Right from the Chozans, Pandiyans and Pallavas... to the Kurunila kings.. we come from a heritage that has woven silks for these kings The silk saree for deity Kanchi Kamatchi is made at our weaving house. People from all over world come to Kanchipuram... believing they will get the best quality silk. That's the trust the people have on us. And that in turn is the respect and value we have for our trade. If that respect and value is tampered... then no matter where it happens... I, Varadharajan will be there to revolt! And so will be my heirs! Release my grandson! Sir, I have pressed charges. I cannot release him. Can you release him or not? Ganesan will be here soon. Ganesa, what happened? Why so late? I'm coming from Chennai, right? What happened? What else will happen when my boss comes here? Dad, what's all this? They are kids but what's wrong with you? Varadharajan is always on the side of truth and justice. Don't you know it, Ganesa? This man, I tell you... Ganesa... time is almost 12. SI and other officers will arrive now. Then they will rip these guys apart. Do something... and get us released, Ganesa. This is embarrassing, dad. Before that use your connection and do something. Connection? He is the only big shot in our family. Now he's also in prison. -Don't mind me saying this. -Tell me. How about Murugan... Varadharajan shall die inside this prison... but I don't even want to see his face. Dad, just shut up! You're spoiling these kids. What a grandpa and grandson team! Hello, Muruga... "Uncle! Uncle!" Welcome Muruga. Hello, who are you? Get up! The one and only son-in-law of the owner of Chandrasekharan silks Mr. Murugan! Sir... -Release them. -Okay, sir Please come. So, big bro... I shall take leave then. First, come home Muruga. Siva, uncle is here! Come on! Welcome, uncle. This is our house. Same house. No changes at all, isn't it? Uncle, right foot. Don't you ever step into this house! Like he hasn't done enough! And you still want to marry his daughter? I am not against love. He is ready to marry his daughter to you in order to reunite with us. -Ganesa, make him understand. -Sure. Look at him and his hairstyle! Chandrasekhar won our trust, then took advantage of us, betrayed and left us. He became a big shot after he left us. Else he also would be wearing such a torn dhoti... sitting on the verandah and telling stories. Please, wait. Muruga... no one's refusing you to get married. We are saying don't live off them after marrying her. Try to understand. I will marry only her, stay there and live off them! You aren't my mother to tell me all this. You're my sister-in-law. Muruga! I told you repeatedly, dear... that he is pure evil. You were more than a mother to him... but look he showed his true colours. Not mother but sister-in-law? Yes. You disloyal mongrel! Get out! I said get out! Don't you ever step into this house! Don't step into this house... This house? Get lost. All of you have fun in this hut. I'm leaving. Look, until you guys come back and say "Please come home, dear son" I won't set foot in this house! What happened, uncle? Why is he acting like this? I have no words to say. Muruga! Mom! -My darling. -Mom! Are you doing good, mom? So long since I saw you. I thought I must not set foot in this house. But after seeing you.. I couldn't help from stepping in, mom. This great man who's sitting on this swing... vowed to make his grandson a great guy. But instead both of them were sitting in prison! Useless fellows! Hence, I have taken a decision. I'm taking Siva along with me. What? No way! Quiet mom! He's a nothing and I'm not going with him. Big bro... think about your son's future. You take him with you, Muruga. -He is too troublesome. -Awesome! -His dad has given the permission! -Grandpa, say something! Dhanam, you are trusting this fellow? Enough is enough. Your pampering has spoiled him. He completed his studies three year ago. But still he's roaming around jobless. On top of all, he also went to prison now! Please have some concern on his career. We feel that... the right thing for him is to go with Murugan. Whether he'll learn to business or not... at least let him learn some discipline. Take care, Siva. God bless you. Where are you off to? Buddy, to Chennai. Your uncle appointed me last night. My duty is to take care of you. Aren't you ashamed? "Dude, to be successful in life you must lose shame, dignity and integrity" My role model taught me this. Who is your role model? My role model is our uncle! Cute Lilliput. Catch it. Sir, the old man is watching and I'm standing in the front of the house. Okay. Okay. See you, grandpa. Uncle, here I come. Uncle, do you own such a big bungalow? It's a costly car. Shut the door in smooth manner. Don't bang it. Greetings. He's a nothing and you say he's your role model? My baby! Look at him running like key operated doll! Welcome. Please, come in. Have a seat. Such a big man yet so simple. Bless me, sir. God bless you. Stop it with your "bless me, sir" He is not Mr. Chandrasekhar. He's Mr. Chandrasekhar's sister, Ms. Lakshmi's... Lakshmi aunty! That's Lakshmi aunty. He is her husband, Arunachalam. My uncle. You may call him 'Sir' Okay, uncle. What does your husband think he's doing? He's unnecessarily bringing strangers to live here. Already he's a dummy living of us and now he brings two more side kicks! How many times have I warned you not to talk ill of him? Why do you keep bitching about him always? Where's Shruthi? She said she had to go to office. Call her. She must be in her room. Shruthi. Dear Shruthi. Coming. This girl? This guy? "Mr. Black eyed peas! Come here!" "She's smiling at me! She's making me fall in love, buddy" "She's making me fly. Like a booze she's got me high." "She's smiling at me! She's making me fall in love, buddy" "She's making me fly. Like a booze she's got me high." "Buddy, she so majestic! Look at her, she's magic!" "She's is the college cutie. Buddy, she's your birdie" "Buddy, she is your bride. Who's that? Push him aside!" "She is Sivakumar's wife. If anyone troubles her, show them the knife" "There we announced it, she is Sivakumar's wife!" "There we announced it, she is Sivakumar's wife!" "Hit it!" "Beat it!" "No worries when we are in college, sleeping in last bench is our routine." "In the evening, we'll woo the girls in the canteen" "I wake up late, drink coffee and then I get ready" "I hang in the crowded bus to reach here and see my baby" "Friendship is our life and we'll sacrifice ourselves for friends" "Mess with our friends and that's where your story ends!" "We show off in front of the girls" "But my eyes are always on my girl" "We give everyone a run for their money" "Try to show off and we'll break you knee" "We are quiet but we also raise hell" "When she smiles, it rings my heart's bell" "There we announced it, she is Sivakumar's wife!" "There we announced it, she is Sivakumar's wife!" "Hit it!" "Beat it!" Why are you looking at her like that? -Do you know her? -No! No, I don't know him. You don't even know me? What are you saying Shruthi? The whole college called you "Sivakumar's wife" and you even smiled. Obviously! It sounded so funny. That's why I laughed. Didn't you find it funny? Funny? What made you think that I will fall for you? So all the time you smiled at me in the canteen and corridor... was that all a lie? If everyone here thought I was your girl then no one would disturb me. So I used it for my safety and security. Security? Look here! I studied in a boarding school till 12th grade. I wanted to have fun hence I joined this college which is near my house. But look what I got. Well, I deserve this! Someone's waiting for your departure so that his highness can propose me. Greetings, senior. What do you want? I'll wait, senior. You finish your conversation and leave. You! Leave him. You call me your wife... but can you take care of me after marriage? Our family status don't match at all. Well, I'll take good care of you. -How? -Hello! During college, I used to run a coaching centre as part time business. If I take it up full time... then monthly I will earn a whopping sum of Rs. 15,000! My driver earns 20,000 per month. I'm bored laughing at you. Now, leave. Hello! Status? Within two years... I will work hard, succeed and become independent as you witness it... and then I will show off and laugh at you! If I fail to do so... I won't! I'll laugh at you! This is this Sivakumar's challeng.... Dude... so that was her? Are you getting emotional? So be it! She might be your ex... but she ain't my x or y or z.... Why are you practicing alphabets? Here for interview, sir? -Why are you bothered? -Dude, tone! Same tone! I make the rules in this house! Obey me and you may live here. Okay, madam. I shall obey you. Funny boy. Uncle also pats me like this. Both of you hear me out clearly! Within one year if I don't work hard, succeed and stand on my own feet... You won't. You can't even stand properly now. This is why she left you back then! Car! -Good idea. -Thank you, madam. I know how to tame you! Watch me now. -I'll get it done, father-in-law. -Send this to office. -Bring Shruthi home on your way back. -Okay. -Uncle! Uncle! -Hold on, please. Well, I have lot of project work. So I can't drive. I need a driver. Shruthi, we'll deal that later. Uncle has to go to office. -Dad! -Brother-in-law, quiet. -Muruga! -Yes... -Arrange a driver. -Consider it done. He will take care of it. Watch out, your leg. Let's go. Bye, father-in-law. Bye. You're my God. Agree to any job they give. Only then you can succeed. Fine, who will be my driver among you two? Driver? Who? Me? Hello, I'm a graduate. Madam, he'll keep showing off. Please give this job to me. What's this? Well, if I sit in the car my feet won't touch the ground. If I keep this brick on the seat and sit, then I can see the road and drive. You're so funny. You're a good stress buster. You be my person assistant (PA) instead of driver. -PA? -My God! Not God! She's our boss! Look here, I am very particular about punctuality. Madam, don't stress yourself hereafter. Look, she can be late... but if you're late by even 10 seconds after she arrives, you'll be fired! Understood? Catch! Why so late? Open the door! How long will madam keep sitting inside. Please come, madam. Here, carry it. That's my photo album. Careful. This is madam's laptop. This is hot water. Let me fix it here. Madam, the bag. Put it around his neck. Here you go. You walk ahead, madam. -Mahesh... -Sir? Hey Manoj! -Hi Shruthi. -Hi. You look good today. What about the internship? All okay? I'll take care of it. I have planned everything, okay? Is daily attendance necessary? You don't have to come everyday. We'll do one thing. I'll get it done at once. Okay? Come. I must somehow impress Shruthi today. Funny guy! Shruthi, who are these guys? So buddy, she finds you funny and he finds me funny. It's fun all the way. You look so funny, dude. I'll play the hero hereafter. You be the comedian. What? You look like a thug with this beard! Remember what grandpa said? For this grandpa... you go there and... stay there for a year and be a good boy. A little more. Now that's the 'Good boy' look grandpa spoke of. My Handlebar moustache! Stop it with your Handlebar moustache! It was madam's order. She said your moustache style was a bit too much. Come, let's go. So, this is all her doing? Yes. What can you do about it? As her driver, what can you do? Manoj! -Yes, daddy? -Come here. You were here? Just come here. Daddy, I've an urgent work. Can I have a word with you? Sure but before that... Our foreign clients are here to discuss business. He is Mr. Peter. He's Manoj, my son. He is the future of this company. Gentlemen, I'll be back in five minutes. Tell them. How dare you shave my beard and moustache? I'll break you jaws! You broke it already! You must be well groomed, that's the office rules. Who said so? Not office rules? Then must be madam's rules. You doofus! Wait and watch... Dad, please sign it. Where's the certificate? Driver! This girl, I tell you! Where is the letter? Hand it over to sir. Sir... -Give. -Sign down there. -Pen... -Here. Father-in-law, did you call me? -No. -I was the one who called you. Asked him to sign the certificate but he said it needs your approval. Hence, I called him. Now, get his approval. Well, dear father-in-law... Students get trained for six months here for this... and we take in only five students per year. So, I thought I'd keep you informed... Can't you handle it yourself? Why bother me? Sorry. This is wrong, sir. That was not me. Dude, no! This is wrong, sir. What's wrong in this? Well, Chandrasekhar silks has a reputation. Many wait for years and then join here for internship, like its their dream. If you sign this... then it's like betraying someone who deserves this even more. Wait, who are you? Don't you recognize him? No. Come closer. He's my elder brother's son. Ganesan's son? Yes. He recognized you. Your father is a very close friend of mine. -He has told me. -Is it? You just spoke your heart out, just like your grandp... Chandru! This is wrong! We value honesty. We value dignity. We value self-respect. If I am bound to weave sarees for you. I, Varadharajan will never weave again. I swear! Well, father-in-law... He was roaming jobless back home. Can we give him some job in our company... Dear, what's your qualification? Well, I completed B. Sc. Textile degree but learnt nothing. I don't get it. Well sir, I didn't learn anything in college. Instead I fell in love. I wasted time going behind that girl. Later, I didn't win her love too. So, you too failed in love? -So, she betrayed you? -No! No! She didn't betray me. Well, I betrayed myself. Looks like she didn't fell in love with me. Is it? Without realizing that... Well, it was depressing. It was tragic. -Tragic, for whom? -For me, who else? That's when grandpa gave me an advice. "Sivakumar, you may fail in love but don't let it fail you in life" That gave me an adrenaline rush, sir. One year, I took care of the production in power loom. Then for six months I worked as sales man in a textile shop. I can manage all the work by myself now. Dear, you seem to be an all-rounder. Of course he is. He can do any and all works. You give an order, he'll own it till it's delivered. He can source any kind of sarees. Try... I am wondering what post I can put you in. Sir, how about a trainer? In training? Well, sir... I read Shruthi ma'am's letter. I saw she's looking for experience in design. What's the need for madam to learn design? I think, madam will be taking over the company in the future. Yes! Yes! Obviously. Hence, I shall train her in all the basic operations. She will get trained... and you'll also benefit from it. It's a Win-Win situation. Very good. Look at that! Yes? He was jobless... yet he created a position for himself! Look how responsible and real he is. And look at you! Good for nothing. Brother-in-law... our foreign clients are waiting. We can start the meeting if you come. In a minute. Okay, dear. You may join next week. -Train Shruthi. -Okay, sir. Uncle! Yes, dear? He is saying it for your own good. Don't be biased since she is from my family. Just do what you think is right. Consider it done! Consider it done and dusted! "Hey you! Hey girl!" "Stop showing off" "Stop now. Hold on" "Don't show me your attitude" "Why do you have so much ego?" "Make way, let me go" "Why do you have so much ego?" "Don't mess with me or you'll lose, honey" "Dance. No romance" "Tell me if you have any plans" "I got so many fans. Come on dance" "Step aside and say goodbye to your plans." "I'll raise hell!" "Hey Mischievous lady. I am a notorious boy, baby" "You are my perfect for me. But I don't like you, you see?" "Hey Mischievous lady. I am a notorious boy, baby" "You are my perfect for me. But I don't like you, you see?" "You are all I think about" "Mess with me and I'll deal you legally, have no doubt!" "You decide. I can be both soft or rough." "I can handle anything tough." "I am your worst enemy. Donât avoid me" "Wherever you go, you will find me" "You are a wild girl, I am a good hunter" "I will put an end to your ego, my dear" "For fun sake" "God, for fun sake" "For you I made up this stupid logic " "In your eyes I see magic, love magic" "Play these tricks to some kindergarten kid" "Dance. No romance" "Tell me if you have any plans" "Dance... Romance..." "Tell me if you have any plans" "Hey Mischievous lady. I am a notorious boy, baby" "You are my perfect for me. But..." "Hey Mischievous lady. I am a notorious boy, baby" "You are my perfect for me. Get lost if you don't me!" Here I come. What is she thinking? She's a venomous snake, after all. Who is she planning to poison next? -Shall we go? -Yes, madam. Greetings sir. Why are you standing here? Uncle, I need to go to a party. Manoj has already left. Our driver is also not here. Now you need a driver, right? Muruga. Drop her and come back soon. No. Don't send Murugan. I will back only late night. Where is your friend, that old driver, Siva? Him? He is sleeping here. Hey Siva, come here. I will call him uncle. Who sleeps in the evening? Come. Come soon. -Here he is. -Greetings sir. -Take her and bring her back safely. -Alright, sir. Take care and come home safe. Okay, uncle. -Take care of her. -Okay. Drive. Start the car. I'll change and come. Wait for sometime. Hello. You are not a designer now. Driver! I donât have time. Start the car. At least let me change the shorts? You stupid. It's already late! That's why even she's not wearing any shorts! Start the car! No madam. I was trying to support you but it came out differently. Start the car. Gods, please save me. Why are you wearing a helmet? He might have grudge. What if rams the car on to something? Dangerous fellow, he won't ram in the driving direction. He'll take reverse, ram in a way that our heads will explode! -God! -Yes! Shut up! Shruthi, I've no grudge on you. I was roaming behind you during college, singing "You're my wife"... but how would you understand that? Even I didn't know what I was doing back then. Only after you rejected me I came in terms with reality. I was angry back then... but it was after college, when I started working... I understood what life is all about. That's why I'm a reformed man, Shruthi. Who? You? Else, everything else is just to pull your leg. Aren't we used to it since college? Use to it? Used to what? Shut up! -Well, right. His words, his choice. -You keep talking. Talk what? About what you were explaining now. Sure. Why not? -When I fell in love with you.. -There he goes! Ma'am, he'll make you fall for his word. Don't you fall for it. Yes, Manoj? I'm almost there. -Right. Right. -Right? Right! Right! Right! You said restaurant, but have brought me here? This is my friends bar. Come on, let's party. -Hello Shruthi. -Hi! Happy birthday. Thank you, please sit down. -How did your birthday go? -It was awesome. What do you drink? It's my birthday party. Order anything. No, I donât drink. Yeah she doesnât drink. I'll bring the sides. Okay? Sorry. It's okay. Hey Roja! Manoj! What are you doing here? -Just partying. -Is it? Let's take a photo and make people in our college group jealous. Bro, your are photo bombing us. Can you move a bit? Please. Friend? Let's meet later. Okay? -Bye. -You're naughty. -If I'm naughty, you're cutie. -Okay. Shall we leave? Who the heck was that? He's a friend. My college mate. He is moving close with you. You call him a friend? It's okay. Cool. -How can I be cool? -We'll leave soon. Who's that guy? Donât do this. Let me go. Listen. Donât do this. -What brother? -Don't act crazy! -Come on. -Hands off me. He is councilor Guna's brother. Look they are his friends. -Let's leave now. -But Manoj? -He is my friend. -We'll call him later. -Why did you dash my girlfriend? -Listen to me. She is your girlfriend? She is my college mate. We were very close. Dashing her isn't a big deal. -It's alright. Sorry. -Sorry? Are you a fool? Stop acting like this! He apologized, right? Then why are you creating an issue? I will create an issue. What will you do? Why are you like this? You embarrass me everywhere. -Get lost. -Hey Roja wait. -Brother, I also know people. - All because of you. -Who do you know? -One second. Dude, I am in trouble. Where are you people? He is councilor Guna's brother. Escape from there first. Brother. Do you know Kumar? Which Kumar? 'Karate' Kumar. -Yeah I know. Call him. -Wait here, I'll bring him. -Hey Manoj. -Wait here. Kumar, where are you? Why is he running like a chicken. Your man is gone. My girl is also gone. Come, let us party together. -No, donât -Come on, stop pretending. Dude, take a picture of us. Come on, baby. -Leave me. -Did you click? You were hanging with three guys. Why are you pretending to me? Smile baby. Come on click it. -Please save me. -What now? Don't you recognize me? Move away. Dude, she took my phone. Give the phone back. Brother, you took photos without my permission. Please tell me your password. I will delete the photos and give the phone back. Why do I need your phone? Look at you. You came to a pub and now act like a saint. You came for booze and now you're complaining? Aren't you just a hooker? Hold in. Hold in. Don't drink and create trouble. Especially, don't trouble the ladies. Siva. Usually you make others cry but now the tables have turned it seems? Here have some Shawarma. Who are you? Me? I am madam's driver. I am from village. When I came here first, even I was shocked seeing all this, just like you. I even sang "Club la mabbu la" and spilled the words. Then I thought to myself. 'Why should I bother about others?' 'Let people mind their own business' 'Men or women, are are same, right?' You have grown a nice bread. Your wisdom will grow next. After reaching a maturity stage... you will be able to judge what's right and wrong. But this is wrong. Say the password, I will delete and give the phone. You're crossing the limit! Crossing the limit? Me? Holy guacamole! Now this is crossing the limit. Damn it! -Mommy! -Johnny! Mommy? You remember her only now? Guys, get him. Finish him off! God damn! Come on, hit him. Grab the bottle. Hit on his head. You! Hit him. Shruthi, give me that bottle. Here, hit him. Brother, donât. Please. Give the phone. Keep the phone inside. Hold this. Hit him. There! I hit him. Give me the phone. Here, I have dropped it. Spare me, brother. Good boy. Let's run! Apologize to her. Sorry. Not like that. With respect. Sorry, sister. Forgive me. Forgive him. Have pity on this poor boy. Get lost. Okay. Give me the shawarma. Let's go. Let's go. Come on. We have reached home. Get down. Why are you weeping now? I feel ashamed. Ashamed? Those guys who did wrong were not ashamed. Why are you feeling ashamed? You know about yourself, right? Why must we care for what others think about us? It was just an accident. Just make sure it doesnât happen again. Stop crying. Stop. I was talking with sense right? Then why is she weeping like a kid? Yeah, cry out loud. I have not seen you cry. It is a splendid sight. I will take a good look. Yeah, you are staring at me now. This look suits Shruthi perfectly. Sorry, madam. This driver spoke too much. Sorry, madam. You are smiling. I won, you smiled. Game is over. Alright. Sleep peacefully. Forget everything. Hold your pride. God! They hit very hard. It's paining. How can you guys hit in the back with a bottle? The whole body is paining. I should get a massage. Sorry. It's alright. What are you doing? What if someone sees us? -You just said right. -Said what? We should not care about what others think. Fa...Faa...Father. Father. My god! "I kept my love a secret because I didn't wanna jinx it" "He shines like fireworks and smiles like a flash" "I become jealous of me for loving this guy" "He shines like fireworks and smiles like a flash" "I see you are single. Can I join you? Let's mingle" "Will you take me along?" "I see you are single. Can I join you? Let's mingle" "Will you take me along?" "I kept my love a secret so that I don't jinx it" "I kept my love a secret so that I don't jinx it" "He shines like fireworks and smiles like a flash" "He shines like fireworks and smiles like a flash" Listen. I would have done the same to anyone. You love me because I am better than Manoj. If someone better than me comes, you will love him too. This is not love. It is... infactu... Yeah that. So sweet. Life always provides you with a better option for everything. But only we know what is best for us. We should protect it right. "He is all I thing about, round the clock" "I have gone crazy, lost in your love" "He looks hot even when he's angry; also his hairdo is swag and crazy" "He stole my heart away" "I love him truly madly and deeply" "All my love is for you, don't push me away" "You make me drench in my shyness" "Every moment spent with you feels like heaven" "He shines like fireworks and smiles like a flash" "He shines like fireworks and smiles like a flash" Stop pretending. I know you love me. Will you accept or not? Listen Shruthi. First finish your college. We will discuss about this love stuff later. You are just a kid. So cute. You're so good with words! Be quiet. People are watching. Oh my god! He is sitting here with her. Get out from there. Get out. Dude, come out. I'm saying they are going to crush you but you are waving like a leader. Will he follow you everywhere? Go away. You ask me to go away? He is going to pass away now. I can't understand you. Who the heck are you? How dare you roam around with Shruthi? You beggar! Manoj! She's way out of your league! What does that have to do with having a juice? You know who I am? Yeah, who are you? One and only Chandrasekhar's son. Yeah, your father's name is Chandrasekhar. Who are you? From the bottom, after lots of struggle and pain... and I slowly make our way to the top... I toiled hard, became independent and earned money myself. Look, I bought my own watch! My shirt! My pant and shoes! I did not inherit these from my father, grand father or my family. I bought it myself. These are solely mine. Likewise. What are the things you own? I have my family. You think the rest are orphans? Come on, dude. Let me tell you fairytale. A lion and a monkey. If there is a competition to climb a tree. The monkey will win right? Does that make the monkey king of the jungle? What would you call a monkey which acts on it's father's orders? Are you calling me a monkey? I never said so. You did. Are you mad? Why did you slap him? Yes! Sorry. It was an accident. Are you okay? Brother, I'm not here to fight. Leave. Leave now. You wont fight right? Sure. Yeah move along. We are chill. Manoj! Have you gone mad? -Damaged. -Enough is enough! Let's go, Shruthi. Baby, are you okay? Baby? -Okay. Okay. -Look at that. What do you want now? You want me to come with you right? No! How dare you mess with my friend? Brothers, you leave. Witness my force. Where are you going? Come back. He is trying to be funny. You go. Show me. You beasts! How dare you hit him while eating? Look, there's sauce on his nose! Blood. You're bleeding! How dare you guys make him bleed? You! Fight me if you are born to a single father! I told you to keep quiet. Why did you do your kung fu and stuff? I did it to save you from them. -Donât cry. -But it's paining. What's with the swag? Put your leg down. So, you showed you true colours, right? You have disgraced me. Why did you fight with Manoj? You caused an unwanted mess. For the sake of my dad and for the sake of my brother... I thought of teaching you a trade and put you in a good place. Thanks for the gratitude, Siva. Uncle... Don't call me uncle! Please! I have had enough. If you stay here one more minute, I will kill you. Don't show me your faces. Go. Get lost! He asked us to get lost and why did he leave? Murugan, wait a moment. Wait for me. I am coming. Uncle shouldn't have spoken like that. Let's finish this biriyani and leave. Siva... It was a misunderstanding. Shruthi told me everything. Sorry. I am your uncle. Understand. I understood! I understood you clearly! You are a disgusting selfish guy! You thought he brought us here out of affection? He wants to show off. He just wants us to look up to him and his fancy job. What? Arenât you living like a slave there? Do you have some self respect? Have you ever thought about the others? I donât know who that guy was. If it was Kanchipuram, I would have buried him. I took beatings from that guy, like I am an orphan. I should hit myself with slipper for coming with you. Hit me with a slipper. Why should you hit yourself with a slipper. We should hit him. Even robots will have some emotions. Donât you have any? Even now, the fault is with that guy but he is confronting you. Are you a man? He keeps tweaking his mustache like you. What the heck? Even this is fake. He was sporting a fake moustache all this while! Be quiet. What? Are you trying to impersonate actor Sivaji? Dude. Just ignore him. He is no man. Why are you touching your hair? Is that a fake too? "Is it paining in your heart" Think about everything he did to me. You sit. We will finish our biriyani. Why are you looking there. Sit. Lets finish and leave to our place soon. Kathir, I think... You spoke too much. I was just telling him about the things that happened. But you used bad language. Pulled his mustache. I never intended it. I just touched it, but it came out. You know it. But the people around us will understand it differently right? You embarrassed him. He cant grow a mustache. He has a complex because of that from childhood. That is why he sports a fake mustache. But you pulled it out, threw it. It's a eleven story building. He might jump off from any floor. He might commit suicide. He has attempted many time before. Suicide? Yes. In childhood days he has done few major attempts. Why are you scaring me? Not scaring you. But what will happen if you go to prison. He was already acting frantic. Go find him and save him. His mustache. If I give this mustache back, he will be compromised right? -Compromise right? -Yeah. Go on. Be right back. I searched the entire office. He is missing. Shruthi is calling. Give me two minutes. Not the time to love! My life is hanging here. Hello. Uncle? Thank god he is safe. In hospital? Where? -What is she saying? -When? How? Siva... Oh my God! Look there. Dude. The entire family is here for uncle. I'm going to prison for sure! Who is he? The person who did this is not a normal person. What are you saying? I have not seen a case like this in my entire service. Buddy... Everybody is looking at me. Buddy. They are not looking at us. But somewhere else... Thank God! Thank God! Uncle... is not dead. But why is looking so savage? Then who is inside? Why? For what? Speak up! My bad. Come home. I will deal with you. Sir. Sir. There is a lift. Take the lift. Is this necessary? Uncle. What happened uncle? I got furious because he thrashed you. I told you before. No to have ties with this cheap family! Did you pay heed to me? You took this mongrel in and even married your daughter to him. See how he has shown his gratitude. It was a mistake. Forgive me. Shut your mouth. Look at his ugly face. I can't bear to see it. What now? Are you threatening me? I also have worked hard for this family. Who are you to speak like this? Let my father-in-law speak. -Get out you filthy dog. -Father-in-law! Father-in-law? You thought I gave my girl for you? It was for your father Vardharajan's name. But he is of no use to me. But you hear his praises everywhere. I want to stop that. That is why. Knowing she loved you, I married her to you and kept you in my house. Look around the house. I have built park with swings. Why? For my future grandson to play with. But you sit on that swing and play. Could you at least sire a child? Don't call yourself a man! Dad... Shut up! Listen. People like you... Even my watchmen has some value. Your are totally unworthy! Get out. You mongrel! Fine, I'll go. I never wanted this house or the luxuries. I was here just for my wife. Come Aishu. We'll leave. Aishu. Go. Get in. -Let's go inside. -Aishu, please come. Go in. Don't go Aishu. Aishu. Come back. Look, he is chasing me out. I worked like a dog for them. Get lost! Nobody loves me! Nobody loves me. I am leaving. Sir. Sir. Car key. He is asking the car key. God! I can't bear this! Look at me. Leave me! I curse you all! I left you all behind for my Aishu. Now they have thrown me out. Sir. Greetings. Here take this fifty rupees. I referred him for this job. Let's go uncle. Here take this five hundred sir. Keep it. You may need it. Please leave. Aishu. They have closed the door. "I am going to Madras." "There's a huge beach over there." "I am going to have an awesome fun time there." "Okay, uncle." "Hope you remember what grandpa said." "I shall grow up and take care of you all." I will take care of you. Come let us leave. I donât need such a life. I will drown in the sea and die instead. Aishu, I am going to die. -Where is he running? -To the sea. He is going to commit suicide! Uncle! Uncle! Donât you have a brain? Is life nothing to you? You will jump in to the sea for this? Few more minutes. Hold on. Listen to your mom Bend down. Bend. Keep quiet. My friend was swimming in the sea for three hours to find and save you. But you came ashore and never bothered to tell us. You donât know even to die properly. Waste fellow! You shed so much tears, better drown in it and die. You are crying and fooling everyone. Why are still talking about dying? He is already broken. Why are you crying now? Nothing happened to me. I am not crying.. for you... -I am not crying for you. -Then for whom? Aishu. Damn it! We should have dealt him for raising hands on Manoj. It is still hurting me. It's the diabetes that is hurting her. What? Why speak about it in the dining table? You ask why? I cannot forgive myself for what we did to her. We have pushed our child into this abyss. Aunt... About us. Wait. Brother. Let's cut of that worthless fellow. And find some better guy for her to marry. Mom, what are you saying? This is a discussion between elders. So shut up. Look at this poor child. She cant even finish her food. Why are you still thinking? Anyway, Manoj and Shruthi are going to be married soon. We should find a guy for Aishu by then. And have the two marriages on the same dias. That way, her remarriage won't look bad. Everything is lost! What are you looking at? -You know I love you ,right? -Grandpa, may I? -My life is ruined now. -See that? Finally, someone is here to question my grandson. Sounds more like abusing to me. Damn you. Come on. Let's get a closer view. Done. I came all this way to ask you for advice! I'm a fool! Keep quiet. Good! Confront him! There was no one to confront him so far. You deal with him. Grandpa, leave me. Can't you be quiet? If you want me to be quiet. Give me a bubble gum. Why are you coming so close for that? A bubble gum, right? Kathir... Yeah buddy. Can you buy her a bubble gum? Come here. I donât want that bubble gum. I want this bubble gum. In those days... We didnât have this bubble gum. Were you chewing on hay then? Look there. -Pandiya. -Yes, sir? What is it? -Hide there. -Okay. Did you see my grandson's girlfriend? See there. Holy guacamole! Please act according to you age! Hiccups. Shall I have some water? Please. Hiccups can be cured with shock treatment. Shock? No... I have raised him like a child. But she seems to be raised wild. -Mommy! -Look here. What is this moron doing in the middle? At least he came. Uncle stop them. What now? Aishu right? Yes. Murugan, she wont do anything against the will of my uncle. At this rate, nothing will change. Lot of things are happening there. Start your own business and take her away. For a second I thought you have changed. My fault. -I saw that. -Well... Not me, it was her. It was her. God, they get to do a lip lock! Either hide or leave. -I will leave once and forever. -Do it! What do you want now? Let's go to the terrace. Come. To the terrace? No, I wont. Grandpa, why did you bring me here? There's a lot going on the terrace. Why are you dusting the old box? Wow. Look at them. How did you get these sarees? I wove these sarees myself. -Give it to me. -Here. An offering? Kathir. Find out what she likes. I am eager to prepare it for her myself. She likes only your son. Cook him and feed her. Doofus! My son has the charm and has got a girl. You're incapable! Buddy, your mom... Why are you staring at mom? What happened? She might have said it by mistake. Buddy. Why are you staring at me? What happened to you? Why is she here? Oh bubble gum? Exchange in the terrace. Time for them to exchange garland. -Give me that plate. -Here. Here. Grandpa, no need for this. Donât say no. It is our family tradition to give saree to our daughter-in-law. Give it to Aishwarya. But there are two sarees. -Oh there is a second one right? -Yes there are. Now that you have come to this house. Can we send you empty handed? This saree is to solve that. You can have it. Okay. Bless me grandpa. Why are you waiting? Come on get the blessing. Bless you. Bless you. You should't leave without eating. -Okay. -Okay. This is not a simple matter. This is the promise made by my family to this village. In ancient times there we had gold coins. But now we had only change coins. Who would have stolen it, Pandiya? Sir... Everything else is in the same place. Expect for the Hundiyal. There is some mystery behind this. I will definitely get that Hundiyal thief. Have you packed everything? I'll ask Siva to drop you. Aunty. Why is everyone dull? Grandpa's Hundiyal is lost. Okay. Where is Murugan? Where? Hundiyal. It's my Hundiyal. That sound. Hundiyal sound. Grandpa. Where are you going? Siva. Look what he has done? Look what he has done? Rascal! What are you doing? Eating mixture. You fool. This is grandpa's Hundiyal. This is not Hundiyal. This is copper pot. If we drink from this. Our liver won't get damaged. You! You! Wait, see what I do to you! You won't change ever. -Kill me. -Grandpa, donât. He is acting. Just acting. Am I acting? Am I acting? Am I acting? Why am I acting? Have you ever asked me? When I was a kid. If guests comes home... and ask you 'Is this your grandson?' You will hide yourself in shame instead of admitting that I am your son. I was longing for your care, dad. So I do all such drama to gain your attention. But you? You have time only to scold me. This gentleman here. When we were kids, he calls me 'Uncle! Uncle!' My friends would laugh at me. That embarrassment. God! Everyone loves Siva at school... Everyone loves Siva at home. All of you, like Siva a lot. But me? More than you all... Siva. I like you a lot. I like you a lot. Dad, I am also the son in the family, right? I also wanted to be pampered like him. To gain that attention, I do such drama. Now, I donât know which is real and which is drama. Even now, I can't say if I am being real or just acting. But my Aishu is not like you. She accepted me for who I am. That is why I chose her over you all... and went with her. Now, she is also not with me, Siva. What did you say? Did I take you with me to exact revenge? Right from childhood... My brother got me into better school and college than you. He chose it carefully for me. Yeah, where is he? Big bro. Busy man. He is toiling for his family. Even without taking a day off. He broke down and called me. That is why I came here. Siva. You deserve better! But look at you! I wished to make you a better person by employing you and teaching you a trade. It was not to exact revenge, Siva. It's alright. That day when that scum Manoj hit you. I literally bit him. This is all I am. This is me. If you people still think I am acting. Come on dad. Stab me with that crow bar. -I donât want anyone. -Muruga. Forgive me. It was all my fault. I made a mistake. Siva, dad is acting now. -Aishu. -I will take you to her. I will take you to her. Donât cry. Aishu. Siva. Sing a song. Donât cry. Kathir... "Life is made of ups and down" "When life kicks you, learn the lesson and keep that frown upside down" "You are what you think.

What happened? Tell me, security. Sivakumar from Kanchipuram has come. Siva? Why is he here? There is also an elderly person with him. Varadharajan? Okay. Make them sit in the lawn. -Donât let them inside the house. -Okay madam. I'll come. It hurts to sit for a long time. Let me lie down for sometime. Did he leave me and go to eat? I have been starving since morning. They both are doing the same actions! I wonder if it's a coincidence or pre-planned? Why are you bringing it? Brother, it doesn't matter. Have this juice and take rest. Okay, dear. Grandpa, we are here since morning. It's evening already. Do we still need to wait? Let's leave. -Awesome! -Siva... Didn't we expect this already? Wait then. We are not leaving until we settle this. I will be done for, before we leave. Get me some water from the pool at least. Let me survive on that. Why do I hear the sound of car? Have they dropped off us in the road? Grandpa! -Bless us! -Bless you, dears! -How are you? -I am fine, dear. How is he doing? Who? I meant my husband! He is fine. But we are not. We are waiting since morning. Since morning? Why? Your mother and uncle are not letting us in? Please wait for two minutes. Shruthi, come. -Dad! -Uncle! Uncle! Grandpa Varadharajan is here. Varadharajan is here? -He is waiting since morning, it seems. -Since morning? Why didn't you tell me this? I forgot as I was busy with work. They are waiting in lawn. Come on now! Get me my shirt. Relax brother... Dear! Dear! Tell me dear, what happened? Brother is getting ready. Take a chair to the lawn. Is that it? I got worried. -I'll do it right away. -Come on. Grandpa, this is what uncle also did here. Get up, buddy. Greetings, sir. Do you remember me? We met years before. -How are you? -I am fine, sir. My brother-in-law is on his way. Greetings! Please sit down. I have been sitting here till now. -It's okay. -You sit down, brother. It's alright dear. Sit, brother. Unfortunate things has happened. Let that not affect the life of our kids. We cannot let that happen. Sir, please. -We care enough about our daughter. -Lakshmi! Let say it's all Murugan's fault... May be he did that by mistake. But we can't leave things like that. By mistake... What else? Chandru! Are you doing this because of your grudge against me? Against you? Grudge? Who? Me? Who are you to me to have grudge against? Chandru, I have regrets too. I forgot them and came to you. Regrets? What are you regretting? What did I do to you? I have not forgotten our past... and that is why I let you inside my house and talk to me. If this is your house, what do you call that? -Keep quiet. -Look at him! This is why I warned you not to treat cheap people equally. Good, dear. Happy to hear. You started your business with this cheap person's help, right? Wasn't it my name that allowed you to marry off your daughter to my son? I know everything. Sir, look... how popular are you outside of Kanchipuram? Chandrasekhar silks is popular throughout Tamil Nadu. Silks are just 10% of our business. 90% of the business run on readymades. Think before you talk. Why is your brand name, Chandrasekhar "silks"? Why don't you proudly name it as Chandrasekhar "readymades"? He has got a point. You rock buddy! Aunt, listen to me. My uncle hit him, so you people kicked him out. Let's say my uncle was wrong... But my uncle is not timid like these people. You talk too much. I did not hit a stranger on the road! He raised hands on my son. Be thankful that I let him go unharmed. You are right. He hit your son. But he is not a stranger on the road! No! He is your daughter's husband. He is your son-in-law. Aunt, did you hear that? A stranger, it seems. Your guy is rocking! Grandpa, advised that... they will kick him out after using him. My uncle did not listen. He was right. You kicked him out after you are done with him. You treated him like a slave anyway. You talk too much. Sir, is this too much? I haven't even begun. So money is everything, isn't it? Money! Money! If you have money, you make the rules! Isn't it? Listen carefully everyone. Come on, buddy. Tell them! -Within a year... -Fire! Fire! -Within 365 days... -Fire! Fire! Within 52 weeks... Dude, you're dragging it. Wrap it up quick! This is Sivakumar's challenge! Let's go, grandpa. Hey, you snapped your fingers, slapped your thigh... all for what? What's the challenge? Bring it on! Bring it on, buddy! Has anyone provoked you till now? The bearded uncle has started it. Challenge him I say! What buddy? I thought they wouldn't notice and I went with the flow. Manage somehow. Why should we explain? It's unnecessary. We won't do it. Buddy, give them a punch dialogue before leaving. Punch dialogue? This is not Sarathkumar's challenge that needs explanation... this is Sivakumar's challenge that goes unexplained. -There you go! -Siva! Come here. Why is grandpa starting all over again? I am here to back you. He asked for it. Your challenge! Sivakumar, tell them what's the challenge! Give me a minute. Let me explain it to grandpa first. Grandpa will convey it to you. Grandpa, there is no challenge. He went with the flow. Try to understand. Yes, grandpa. Grandpa, handle it and let's leave. Looks like his grandpa is planning something. Let him. Let's see! Chandrasekhar showed his arrogance! So far your uncle has been a comedian to you people. It's time to show my serious face now. Kathir. It's time for the world to witness my true self. Everyone knows that you are the son-in-law of Chandrasekhar. Let me have a word with him. Uh-oh! So you're going to call my father-in-law? He will be busy. It's been two days since he spoke to me. Since you are so doubtful. This is my card. There is no need to call my father-in-law. You can call me anytime. Siva, he looks doubtful. Let's go. I said let's go. Siva, this place will not work out. Don't go. Listen to me. Come on, please don't get upset for such silly things. Sit down. Of course he's upset! Do you know how busy he is? For the sake of this kid... he took leave from work. He's bombarded with calls. His phone is dead yet he's getting calls. Alright. You are the Varadharajan's son... Chandrasekharâs son-in-law. -What else is required? -The order. -There is... -One lakh I know... Thank you... Thanks for trusting me. I won't let you down. -All the best. -Thank you, sir. -I will take my card. -Okay. Why are you taking back the visiting card? One visiting card making charge is three rupees! -Sir, it's wrong... -Siva, why are you still here? Siva, I will take care. Come with me. Siva, come on. I'll lose my wife, Aishu. Just come. Do you want me to hang myself? -Isn't this wrong? -No, it isn't. -Greetings, brother. -What do you want? I hope you know Siva, my brother's son. Of course, I know Siva. They are gym-mates. Well, he's planning to start a business of his own. -Okay -He has got an order. -Okay. -He needs five lakhs. I offered him but... he refused to take from family... he wants to make it on his own. He wanted a loan for interest. So, I got him here. -Your father despises loan and interest. -But he needs it. Siva, let me do the talking. Give us a minute. He is feeling shy. Siva... Please... We are on the roof... I will jump... My wife, Aishu! I want her! Understand this uncle. I will pay the interest. Please. Go ahead. Go and stand there. Go and stand. He said he will pay the interest. Do you need any documents? Five lakhs is nothing. We don't need document for that. Five lakhs is a small number in Chennai. It's a huge thing for him. They are Kanchipuram boys. Very poor boys. They will go berserk if they get five lakhs. Hey, the five lakhs which you audited this morning... -hand that to Siva... -Thanks. You can't get good quality thread for low cost. True. Can you try some low cost but good quality thread? You get 'Knotty threads' in low quality. You get 'Fletcher threads' in high quality. What do you want? Knotty. Give us some 'Fletcher' threads. You are starting a business for the first time. Make sure it is of high standard. Good quality products earn customers trust. You either start crying your wife's name 'Aishu' Or you start crying for money. I am not denying it. Neither I got my wife nor money! We trust Siva. Money is not a problem. Pay us back when you can. -Thank you so much. -Yes! Give us four more bundles? He'll break your jaws. Let's scoot. -I am leaving buddy. -Why did you put back that moustache? -Stop twisting your wrists. -Go, I will come. Siva, the orders have piled up. The work isn't over yet. We bought the threads because you promised us. -Why are... -Buddy, let it go! Let's go to Annamalai's shop. Siva, please understand. No matter where you go, you won't find a machine. What? I'll tell you but don't tell my name. I got a call from the association instructing me not to take your orders. Association? -Who could it be? -I don't know buddy. Isn't it Chandrasekhar? Wait. I'll handle it. -Pack everything. -What about these? We'll manage. God! You didn't mention that you got kicked out of Chandrasekharâs house. God! Honesty is more important in this line of business. Please, sir. He is the head of our association. We can't do anything against him. Let go of the advance. You may leave. What about the rest? How do we repay the loan? Sir, your son used Chandrasekharâs name and took a loan of five lakhs. When I asked around, I learnt that he got kicked out of Chandrasekharâs house. My business runs on trust. Your son is not honest. Give me my money back. I will leave right away. Yes brother. Please check if you could arrange it. I will call you right back. Siva, come. Grandpa, about that... what happened was.... Uncle tried to... -Pandian... -Yes, sir. Ask him to bring the house documents. Grandpa what are you up to? Dear, grandpa has decided. Go and get it. I left the village, my family... and toiled for 20 years... and this is what I get! Even when you were jobless, didn't I take care of you? Can't you stay put? Look at him. My son and my father both are hopeless. Hand it over. Sell the only house that is left. As long as I am alive, I will earn for this family. Go and beg in the streets once I am gone. -Why do you speak like this? -Stop it. -Mom, brother is... -Muruga... Stay put Muruga... Dear... Siva, tell him I didn't do anything. No one understands me. No! Hundiyal! Here I come! Aunty from soap opera, come out. Aunty, come out. Sir, please don't... I don't have anything other than liquor in here. Aunty, come out. What's this? He is drunk and is creating a scene! He has come with that intention. Shall I wake up dad? No, don't do it. Call 'Karate Kumar' No, sir. (Sings in gibberish) Do you understand? That's how it is for me when you speak. Aunty, I am calling you. Don't you hear me? Senior watchman is here. You may leave. Are you creating a scene? You see I can create a scene only when I am drunk. What is my father's fault? What is Siva's fault? Why is he spoiling my life? If he wakes up and comes here... Then mind you! "Oh my God! Father-in-law is coming! Father-in-law!" Did you think I'd react like that? Hey, Chandrasekhar. Come out. Show respect! My wife! My darling Aishu. Go inside. -Sister, get in. -Come to me dear. -Please aunty. -Get out of here. Aunty, send her with me. Poor girl. I said, get out. She is my wife. Stop the car. Won't you listen to me? -What's your problem? -Open the door? He is the one. Kick him out. Damn it! Out! Boys, hit him. My wife Aishu is inside. Please let me out. I will kill you too. Who is that? What's happening? Have you kidnapped her? Family matters! Let it go. I can't take it. -Please let me out. -Get inside, I said. Do whatever you want! They are beating up our uncle. Thrash him too. Who is he? -Hit him first. -Enough with him. Thrash him. Thrash them! Finish them off! How dare you attack from behind? Be fair! Four of you are hitting one! Buddy, a Zebra is charging at you. Buddy, knock him out. Break his jaw! Awesome buddy! Bring it on! Come on! Nobody's coming if I call out. Awesome! Let him drown to death. -Where is he? -Manoj, how dare you set thugs upon us? Wear this first. Now take care of him. Take care? Brother, let me go. Aunty, call my father. -Catch him! -Manoj! Manoj! Save me! Save me! Brother! -What happened? -Brother. -Mom, why are you shouting? -They are hitting Manoj. Daddy! Fine, it's okay. Dear, don't cry. Don't cry. Come here. I won't hit you. Come here. -It's paining. -Why don't you get up? -What happened, dear? -Dear, get up. Get up. Don't cry, dear. You thugs, stop your rowdyism! Thugs? Do we look like thugs to you? Right! Dude, coolers look fine. Button up your shirt Then you'll look decent. Sir, what do you want? We were making our own path... why do you track us and stomp on us? -What wrong did we do to you? -True! Stomp on you? Who? Me? Get lost! You are nothing to me! -If you didn't do it, who did it? -Answer us. I did it. I did everything. You walk into our home and how dare you challenge us? You thrashed our boy. And you thought we'll be quiet? I did it! Brother, ain't I your sister? Did you notice? She is the antagonist! Told you! Dad! That day, you embarrassed him a lot. Do you want to know the truth? I have pregnancy issue. We are taking the treatment for that. He asked me not to tell you people. But you kicked him out. Enough, dad. I will go with him. That will be respectful of me. Aunty, let's go. Let's go to our home. Come on. Dear, let's go. Please wait. It's not nice to send off a daughter at night time. You guys leave. I will drop her by morning. Inform grandpa about this. Don't create ruckus here after. Sir! If you are decent, we will be decent too. -Problem solved. -He hit me with a stone. -Let's go. -Siva... Come here. Tell me uncle. I never knew you loved me so much. I will not drink here after. I don't care if you booze or do not booze. Why do you use grandpa's Hundiyal? He chases us in the morning for it. We didn't fight for you. We fought for grandpa's Hundiyal. I will kill you. Come now. Nobody loves me! -Doesn't look like he'll change. -I said, come! Come in, dear. Last night when Siva said you will come today... we just couldn't believe it. We were so excited. Siva took care of all the decorations. He did all these to please you. Is it? It's nice. -Let me bring you some coffee. -What are you looking at? -Come here. -Come in brother. God! So... Move. Uncle is over there. What will happen if he finds out? I thought about it too. Instead of us telling them... it would save our time if they find out by themselves. Save our time? Do you think that they will agree to our marriage right away? Marriage? We still have three more years for that. Do you think I'm doing the internships to come and romance you? Then for what? I am good at studies! I will leave abroad after my exams. I will do my Masters there for 2 years. I will work for an international brand for a year. I will start my own brand after I return. Sure, why not? I thought you will miss me if I go abroad. But look at you! You show off! Mr. Rascal, a guy like you... must be gifted to get a girl like me. Do you understand? I thought you'd be a good guy... but looks like you love teasing me. I am a good boy... but I have nothing. Will they let you marry me? What if we get caught and they marry you off to someone else? So cute. Take this bubble gum. Here. Give it to me. Take it. I hear chewing sound. It's coming from upstairs. Have they started the feast already? Buddy? You were exchanging bubble gum, is it? Why don't they buy two bubble gums and chew it? Stop teasing me! Bubble gum should be banned. Chandru, have some coffee. No, thanks. Give it to him. -Take it Chandru. -Greetings, sir. Everyone's here? What is this? Why do you keep them standing? Siva, bring the snacks. Chandru, why don't you sit down? Here are the sweets. -What is this? -Let me bring some plates and chairs. Dear, come here. We got to talk something important. Wait here. Chandru, have some sweets. We shall talk later. Sweet? Do you think that I came to drop my girl and have sweets? She will leave you all... and will come back to my house. I came to inform you that. So... I heard you have mortgaged all your documents. I heard you will lose this house in six months time. See that? On top of that, you brought my girl to this house. How dare you throw a challenge at me? You kid! You will hit my son in my house. You thought I will be a mute spectator? I would have used my power and influence to crush you right then. But that will make you and your grandpa a hero in the village. That is why I have spared you both. Your family must see you and your grandpa as villains. How dare you snap fingers at me? Now watch me do it! I'll ensure that within a year, you and your family will be at my doorstep! And this is Chandrasekharâs challenge! Anyone who has the intention of ruining other's lives will never prosper. Don't you worry, Siva. We'll handle it. I did all that for the benefit of uncle and aunt. I handpicked everything myself. Wow! Tea is here. It's been more than 20 years since all these materials entered our house. I feel like it's yesterday that I vowed to stop spinning. Why did you stop weaving? Chandru was a good person in earlier days. I treated him as family, like my son. Sir, we don't need this. This is part of our family tradition. You are a part of this family too. Take it. No, sir. Alright, you take it. Accept it. What a technique? What an engraving? Amazing! This is not ordinary silk. This is invaluable. Can you source this? Then we can open a shop for ourselves. Let me leave this job. I will look after the shop. -Sir, I need a help -Tell me. I have finalized a small shop in Madras. We were in dire need of money then. I shall pay you instead of paying someone else. It was not just for the money. Because Chandru asked for help. I did what I never did for others. He is asking for a sign. Give, I'll sign it. I trusted him and signed all the papers he asked me to. I didn't know that it was going to change my fate. Things went well for three years. Back then you were innocent and naive kids. Guess I too was naive back then. Money spoilt Chandrasekharâs character. For the last four months, you have been paying only half the wages. It is money you want, right? -Here! -Chandru! This is wrong. No one is begging you for money. We are asking our wages. Everyone works hard for your sake. Money is temporary. Surround yourself with genuine and honest people always. That's the real wealth. If this is how you treat people who work for you... then I won't be weaving silk for you. Oh! So you won't weave. For the next 20 years, if you are to weave... it should be only for us. It's written exclusively in the agreement. Do you know that? If you don't weave for us... you can't weave for anyone else. Bring the agreement. Not only him. No one can weave anything anymore. We will file a case on everyone and put you all behind bars. Are you threatening us? If sir is not weaving, none of us will do it. Do what you can? You became a little rich and you're throwing us out? Get this! We are throwing you and your family out of this village. Vacate the place along with your family. Who is throwing whom here? If not for me, you all would be begging for food. What did you say? Do we look like beggars to you? We value honesty. We value dignity. We value self-respect. If I am bound to weave sarees for you. I will never weave again. I swear! Lock the weaving house. -Hello Siva. -Hello brother. Well, brother... need some more time to pay back the money. It might take a month... We haven't woven any sarees yet. I shall pay you back in a month's time. Siva, what is there to tell you? We are also financially tight. Just pay back as soon as you can? -Thanks brother. -Okay dear. There is nothing to hide from you. Chandrasekharâs people called. They are ready to pay 15 lakhs for your house. What shall we do? Brother, this is our traditional house. I know. I have not take any step, because it's your house. Do me a favour. Pay back the money in three months and I will give you the documents. I won't be responsible if it's too late. Okay, brother. Brother, don't say anything to Grandpa like last time. I will arrange and return the money. Okay, Siva. Make it quick. Thanks, brother. Siva! Are we loosing the house? Let it go! We shall stay in hotels. You have a great sense of humour. Why didn't you say these things during my childhood? I hoped weaving and these bad experiences will end with me. May be... I am wrong. Grandpa! What's your fault? Wishing for everyone's well being is not wrong. We try hard to progress in life but they keep stomping on us. What do we do? There will be no hope to work. Don't you worry. I will take care. Even now... you think about everything. I am elder by age. But you are elder by heart. You are wiser than I am. Come on, grandpa. Our family used to weave silk for kings. We could have amassed a lot of wealth, if money was our motive. Even after knowing how to weave 'Rajapattu'... I did not learn to survive. Why do you feel so bad, Grandpa?... Grandpa! What name did you say? Rajapattu. Raja... Listen... This is "Rajapattu" It's a vintage classic. There's no one weaving this silk for the last 20 years. In fact, we can say that it's extinct. What's the lifetime of these sarees? Five years? But this will last for 50 years. Grandpa! Which is "Rajapattu?" All that we weaved are "Rajapattu" Grandpa! Come along with me. Where have you kept the old sarees? You can't get in? Whom do you want to meet? -Function is going on -They know me. -Don't make a scene. -Madam knows me well. Kumar, what happened? What is the problem? Who are you? Madam, I am Sivakumar from Kanchipuram. We've met. You had asked for "Rajapattu" -Yes, I remember. -I have brought those for you. Sir, have a look at these. My God! It's all original! It's a wonder, madam! It's all original! I know! It's God's blessing. I was looking for this over a year. I was tensed as daughter's marriage is near and we have not got these sarees. I was wondering what to do. God has sent you to me. Discuss the formalities. I will be back with my cheque book. Come over here. Sit down. How is this possible? God exists. Sir... I don't know if God exits... but there's a lot of debt existing. Buddy, all of these are "Rajapattu" What's the big deal? Sir... middleman like you are living like a king. Those who toil hard to weave the silk into a saree... men like my Grandpa struggle in poverty, lose their self respect... because of loans. Sir, I have a debt of five lakhs. It is enough if I settle that. My ancestral home is mortgaged. -I must save that. -Don't cry. -I want to repay the loan. -Stop crying... Please sir. Don't you worry about anything. I will take care. What is he saying? Well, madam... Around five lakhs... Madam, he is expecting five lakhs for a saree. Five lakhs? If we agree for five lakhs.... Sangeet, Engagement, Reception and Marriage. I need 4 sarees. I will pay only 15 lakhs. Did she say 15 lakhs? -Accept the offer. -If it's okay, I will write my cheque. It's a little less. Not right away. Act like you are thinking. I need to think about it. If it's 15 lakhs... -raw materials... -Don't think too hard. Take it. -Okay, madam. -Okay. I want my sarees to be customized. Okay? Thank you so much, madam. She is a God. 15 lakhs... It's just 15 lakhs... How is it possible? There is car called Rolls Royce... Heard about it? There are other cars that has better engine than it. -Why is it so costly then? -Why? Because it is hand made with utmost care. And they make sure to advertise the fact that it is hand made! This is "Rajapattu" Weaving "Rajapattu" is not an easy task. It's a skill. The money is for the skill. It is valuable only as long as there is demand. I have many contacts like this. Don't give this away to shops. You don't have to worry here after. We will sell this as 'custom made Rajapattu' We'll sell one saree for five lakhs. -Five lakhs. -Okay? Five lakhs... Brother... I don't know who you are but... you have helped a lot. You are my God. You are my God. I am no God... I am after... Commission. Madam, these are old documents. They aren't even properly registered. Many regulations have changed since then. Bonded labour is illegal. We can even file a case demanding compensation. Sir, they have fooled you. Siva, shall we file a case. If we have the chance to win, we shall do it. Don't do that. No need to file a case. You don't need it. If you don't want compensation, let me have it then. I am not scared of the paper... I took a vow! How can I break my own vow? Varadharajan will never break his vow. Grandpa, are you nuts? Maintaining vows is fine but not for those cheaters! These guys are fraudsters. Even she said that they have fooled you. Why don't you tell him? Grandpa, it is true. Grandpa, you said no to compensation. You may break the vow! Why don't you open the weaving house for your uncle's sake. Shruthi, tell him. Grandpa, Siva has a point. "Love is deep rooted and it goes a long way" "Brace yourselves, our journey is long and we're here to stay" "Time to be strong and brave." "Sky is your limit, time to play!" "Let your work talk and make the world talk about you!" "Be prepared to shed you blood and sweat" "Always be loyal, never forget!" "Happiness lies in winning together" Sekar took up welding job. Dhana is driving cab these days. Muthu's father is working as a server. Our generation doesn't know a zilch about this. Even we don't know. Who else will come? I will take care of this, grandpa. "Love and relations are immortal" "This must pass to every generation, like good morals" "Your love will protect those who seek you" "All our vanished dreams will now come true" "Love is deep rooted and it goes a long way" "Time to be strong and brave." "Sky is your limit, time to play!" "Let your work talk and make the world talk about you!" "Be prepared to shed you blood and sweat" "Always be loyal, never forget!" "Happiness lies in winning together" "Time to be strong and brave." "Sky is your limit, time to play!" "Let your work talk and make the world talk about you!" Brother, accept this. Brother, here. Take it. Looks like there is lot of money. Why don't you check it once? We are aware of it. There is no mistake. Dear, we don't need this much of money. Why don't you pay your debts first? We don't have much expenses. Brother... My debts are my problem. This is the wage for your work. Grandpa always says, we will be happy only if you all are happy. Grandpa, isn't it? God bless you, dear. Thank you. Ask Mr.Pandian if you need anything else. -Mr. Pandian, ensure every one eats. -I'll take care of that -Buddy, take care. -I will buddy. Everyone should have their feast before they leave. I am very happy, dear. If your grandma had witnessed this... she would be very happy. As they said, God will bless you. God will bless you. Put this 500 rupees in the Hundiyal. Now. I broke the Hundiyal. You broke it? Are you going to hit me for it? Grandpa, don't you get tensed. Some forefather of yours... must have got lot of money. To cut short his expenditure... he would have saved it in order to distribute it to others. But he was doubtful if his next generation would do the same. He got hold of a vessel. He named it Hundiyal... Asked everyone to save in it and distribute among everyone. He instilled hope stating that it is a habit to be passed on to generations. There is no powerful weapon than hope. It's just a vessel. But has changed lives of so many people. It is similar to the concept of God. It is a stone if you think it is a stone. It is a God, if you think it's God. Without understanding the concept behind this belief... if you blindly believe in something... it is called superstition. The place you are standing right now. This is the Hundiyal. We will build such Hundiyals all over. For our company employees... a percentage of our profit will be paid automatically. We will look after everyone who works for us. Grandpa, enjoy your life. I will take care of everything else. Siva, I feel so proud. You helped win the challenge I made to your father. Come on, grandpa! I raised you right! Why do you get emotional? What are you doing here at this hour? Eloping from your house... was wrong. Grandpa, I have no other option. They are planning to get me engaged to Manoj, tomorrow. I love him and will only marry him. Grandpa, get us married. Siva, she came down trusting us. Do the needful. Sir, please. Not allowed. Ma'am... Siva, let's not do this. Please. We'll handle it. Come on. -Please. -Just come. Siva... Brother! Brother, come have a look at this. Greetings, sir. It was her choice to leave. Yet you brought her back? Are you so scared of me? Get a chair for my brother. Brother-in-law... A timid person will never speak up. There, like that uncle. First, understand the difference between fear and respect. You may ask me "Why do you respect me?" Sir, a small time saree salesman from a small town... rules such a big saree business kingdom! That's not a simple achievement, sir. You are an inspiration to all the youths in my village. You are the hope for youngsters like us. But why do you kick us down and won't allow us to grow? You challenged him and now what's all this peace treaty? Challenge? Sir, that challenge was nothing. I grew up watching my grandpa. At times I get emotional and throw a challenge. Nobody takes it seriously. You took it so seriously... and came to my home and challenged me saying "I'll bring you to my doorstep" Look, within a year I am already at your door step. I lost and you won. What can we do? Life itself is a challenge for us. Forget this. My grandpa took a vow against you. No weaving was done for years. Tell me who got benefited from it? All these challenges and vows are what feeds the ego. That weaving house is everything to my grandpa. Didn't he give it up? We just got one life, sir. One blink and everything will be over. That's all about life. Don't hold on to the silly ego and spoil your son's life. Brother... I and Shruthi are in love. We just didn't tie the knot but we are a couple. Now, tell me. Do you still want her? What do you mean? Don't you understand? You fool! Sir, she cares for me and so she came running to me. My grandpa always cared for everyone and taught me that. Hence, I care for you all and that's why I brought her back. Shruthi... I love you! I will only marry you. But you're innocent and naive, Shruthi. Aren't you still studying? Didn't you want to fly abroad and study? Fly abroad and do your higher studies. Go and work for a year then. Have fun. First, enjoy your life. I am your life partner not your life. Tell me when we must tie the knot and we shall tie the knot! Let me see who can stop us. What's your problem? Remember she eloped from here! You still want her? Daddy, it's okay! I want Shruthi! If you want her then you won't get a single penny from my wealth! Brother, why are you talking about wealth now? Tomorrow, Shruthi and Manoj are not getting engaged anymore! I'll get them married! I dare you! Try your best to stop it! Wait, we will think and then discuss about it. What's there to think and discuss? This is my son's life. I must give it a good thought. So, that's your plan? It's not like my daughter won't get better grooms. Remember, the Arun builders family came with an alliance. You were there. I refused because I don't want anyone else's hands on our wealth. The moment you said so... I too shall now look for a suitable groom for my daughter. Please do, dear. Find a groom that will suit your status. But one thing... Don't search a groom for Chandrasekharâs sister's daughter! Chandrasekhar mills' manager's daughter... that's your status. So search accordingly. Brother! Shut up your mouth! Does she look like a toy to you? Stop auctioning her! Can't you see that boy is talking in our favour? I'll finish you off! See that, brother? How he's treating me in front of you? Your brother? What can he do to me? He'll either kick me out of house or fire me! I can find such a watchman's job outside too! Dear... give us two months time. We shall get out of here and settle down. Then bring your grandpa and we shall fix the engagement. And when you guys think is the right time... you may get married. Don't tempt me to become a murderer. That's all the respect I have for you! -Shruthi... -Yes, dad? Come, let's go. Brother, look how he insulted me and left. Come with us now and you'll have food to eat. Or else you'll be left to beg on the streets. Brother... I can't see you beg on the streets. Leave. Oh my God! I curse you! Your life will be ruined! Shruthi, wait! I'm coming. That's the end of my love! That's the end of my life! Are you a fool? Don't ever show me your face! Fool! My grandpa often tells me... "We can make money any time. Money is temporary" "First, surround yourselves with genuine and honest people" "That's the real wealth" I am sure he'd have told you that. You wouldn't have paid heed. I thought, I'll make sure you hear it now. See you, sir. "Chandru..." "No matter how successful you become, don't forget your roots" "Money is temporary" "Surround yourself with genuine and honest people always" "That's the real wealth" "Understood?" (FEW YEARS LATER) Varadharajan sir who hails from Kanchipuram... for his achievement in the field of weaving the "Rajapattu"... had been recognized and honoured by the government. In order to award Sir Varadharajan... I call up the central minister. "All the money and wealth we earn is not forever" "Nothing is permanent here" "Though the mind can be drawn to money at times..." "but you can't take it with you when your time is up?" "A smile is all we need, that's all..." "to lighten the burden of our hearts for once and for all" "A smile is all we need, that's all..." "anger, sorrow and betrayal will fall" Varadharajan sir, any help at any time, do tell me. I'm here for you. Nice to know. Okay? See you then. -My pleasure. -See you all. Come, there he is. Grandpa, he wants to interview our family. Sir, if you call your family members we can click a photo. It's a one big family. No problem, sir. Call everybody. -We can click a photo. -Everybody come here. Arunachalam, please come. Mom, come. "We will leave empty hands and don't know how long we got" "For what are we doing all this? Have we ever thought?" "All the money and wealth we earn is not forever" "Until you are alone without your loved ones, you will never realize it ever!" Grandpa! Grandpa! Come, let's take a family photo. Come on, grandpa. "We will leave empty hands and don't know how long we got" "What's the worse can happen? So, let's live in unity and move forward" "A smile is all we need, that's all..." "it'll lighten our burden for once and for all" "A smile is all we need, that's all..."
