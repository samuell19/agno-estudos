ADULTHOOD Stop! Please! Thank you. Kyung-un, aren't you cold? Thank you for coming. It's all right. Uncle will take you home. Is home this way? It's okay. I'm your uncle. Come on. You don't remember me, do you? Last time I saw you was at my mom's funeral a while back. What happened to the condolence money for your dad? Dad's friend sent it to my account. He did? That's a relief. So your mom never called? I'm worried about you. Will you be okay alone? I can take some days off for you. I'm fine. I was alone when Dad was hospitalized. - Anything else? - Well... You must be tired. Get some rest. Call If you need me. Oh, you don't have my number. Here. Kyung-un? You asleep? I'm sorry. Did I wake you? Where's the bathroom? Your dad asked me to take care of you in my dream. Hey, are you okay? Affidavit of Death Hello. Can I have one? Yes. Thank you. Gotcha! Your legs are too weak. You want to go hiking with me? Want to see your mom? If you want, I can find her. Why do you care? You sure he's your uncle? I guess. Watch out for other stuff. Like what? Think about it. You're living with a stranger. Hi, girls. To the VIP room. - Girls, four beers. - Coming. Never trust men. It got me thinking. Why now after all this time? Darling So-young: When can I see you? JYP Lady: Don't you love me anymore? Jamsil Lady: Play Anipang! Jae-min's Phone Backup Coming. You're home. What have you done? I changed it. Your birthday. Press 0206. What are you doing? Hey, try this. Stop it. - Come on. Try it. - I ate already. You did? What are we gonna do about all this food? Wow, I'm so good. Don't ever touch my stuff! Hey, can we talk? Here's the thing. I feel really bad that I couldn't help when your dad was sick. I wasn't by his side because I was far away. Far? Where? In Shanghai. For work. What do you do? Oh, I'm a chef. I'm looking for investors for my restaurant. How did your dad's insurance work out? You could be in trouble unless adults take care of it. You're too young to understand. Dad said never trust anybody. Oh, here it is. That's me, and there's you. Am I still just anybody? You see, I was the dance machine of a boy band called Rome. Boy band? You were a singer? Your dad didn't tell you? I was a singer with a debut album. Hey everyone. I'm Augustus, the dancer of Rome. Hope you enjoy our music. Did you have Caesar in your Rome? Of course we did. He was the lead vocal. We also had Nero, Marcus, and Titus. It didn't work out. Now Caesar sells crabs in Oido Island. What I'm trying to say is blood relations are special. It's out of human control. Biologically, we share an eighth of the same DNA. When did you last see your mother? I heard I was two. But I don't remember. We're here to find a legal guardian who can watch over you. Your mother had lost her custody. We want to find someone that's a close relative. With your consent. What happens if I don't have one? We could find you a center or a foster home. But it's better to find a guardian than going to a home. Convince him! I really can pay soon. Hey. I'll call you back. Is it over? She wants us both. She does? Wait. Your hair... Okay, you do it. Hello. Ms. Kyung-un Hwang? Anybody home? Coming. - Ms. Kyung-un Hwang? - That's me. Registered mail. Life Insurance Thank you for waiting. The payout has been made. To who? It was filed by Jae-min Hwang. $80,000 was paid in full. Your call cannot... 175-4... You need something? Do you know Jae-min Hwang? Honey, did your mom run away? Where is that jerk? Jerk? You little! That's his bag! No, it's not. I got it from the Salvation Army. Don't come looking for him here. - Get out. - You know him! Get out! Don't ever come back. Or else! Go home! LOL! How? Kick him in the balls! Twice! What a life you have. You paid off the principal? You're lucky they ended there. I know. Your call cannot be connected. Please leave a message. What the... Oh? What? How did you find this place? Stay still! Stay! You all right, man? Geez. You almost killed me. Thank God you missed by an inch. Where's the insurance payout? As your guardian, I'll explain what happened. I don't care. Give it back. I'm borrowing it. It's yours when I'm out of the hospital. I want it now. No. Why not? I don't have it. Wait! Hello. Okay. I'll be right there. See you later. You know what? It's all done. Sit tight. Uncle will bring it back. Do me a favor. Can I borrow $100? What? You got $100? If I'm not back in 20 minutes, take a cab, go home. Okay? 24-hour Laundry Oh, you're a mess! Darling... I'm all right, but I still can't reach Yong-sik. You're just too nice. Don't ever co-sign a loan again. And ditch that jackass Yong-sik. I had no time. This was all I could get. I'm not good enough for you. Darling, don't. You're breaking my heart. What the hell? I'm your paycheck, asshole! What the fuck? How much did you take, you leech! All my hard-earned money went to this gigolo! - Wait! - You're dead, prick! You think you can get away? Today's your funeral! Dad! Dad, are you okay? Jae-min, you have a daughter? You! You are amazing! You should be an actress. Dad? Ouch! Having a daughter solved everything. That guy softened too. How much pocket money did she give you? A kid is a nice touch. It opened her heart and her purse. Hey. You're a gigolo? So-young and I were in love. It's not what you think. Sweetie Ji-hye, Cutie Mi-yun, Darling So-young. What the...? Where did you get that? Give me my money or I'll tell you're a conning gigolo. Up to you. What are you writing? Wait. Kyung-un Hwang! You're gonna be in big trouble! Fine. Ouch. Look here. I'm really hurt. I didn't know they'd take the money. I'm your uncle. I'd never steal from you. I had a debt and that money did cover it. But that's not why I found you. I'm so sorry. I will really pay you back. How? I'm working on something big. If it works out, we're all set. Nickname, Envely. She runs a kindergarten. A widow. She's made money with stocks. Nickname, Sommers. Owns a convenience store, divorced. Not your type though. Thank you. She hates younger men. Nickname, Forget-me-not. Sommers brought her. Pharmacist. Owns a four-story building. She's loaded and single. But she's a bit... Bitchy. Just your type. Yahoo! Yahoo! Yahoo! Nobody does that anymore. You could be fined. Come this way. Take a break. You see... All the screaming can spook wild animals. Man, these women are tough. - Chef! Join us! - Yes, I'm coming. Try this. It's from the best rice cake place. - I'll do it. - Just open up. That looks so good. I'm famished. - Ta-da! - Would you look at that! Come over here! Come, gather around. One, two, three! Yummy yum! - Hands up! - Hands up! I've slept with someone this week. Yes or no? One, two, three! You can't drink if you don't play. Stop grabbing me. We're all single. Is it a crime to be a bit touchy-feely? Don't get your panties in a bunch. Oh yeah? Are all single people desperate like you? Why join a hiking club then? Because I love mountains! Okay, fine! Come on, girl. - I'm leaving. - Don't go! Jum-hee! She ruined the party. I'm sorry. She's been alone for far too long. What a piece of work. So annoying. Excuse me. What? These. Thanks. And this too. They're just drunk and lonely. Don't take it personally. Being lonely is not a free pass! Does your wife know you're out with women? My wife passed away. I live with my daughter. I married young. I'm sorry. Don't be. You didn't know. I see a cab. Siheung-dong, please. Sir, take her home safely. Good night. This one's gonna be tough. A tough nut to crack. Who is it? Your landlord. - It's me. - Hello, sir. Hello. Remember me?? It's freezing outside. This is sweet potato. Hope you like it. Thank you. - Is the boiler working okay? - Yes. And your father? I guess the same. Any adult I can talk to? No, no one. Well, I didn't want to break it to a kid, but tell your dad I had to raise the rent deposit. Kitty. Kitty. Kitty. Hi, I finally found you. You look lovely in your lab coat. My name is Jae-gu Park. Hi, I finally found you. You look lovely. I'm Jae-gu Park. Hi, hi, hi... Hi. I finally found you. You look lovely in your lab coat. I'm Jae-gu Park. How did you...? You stopped coming to the club and I got curious. Why would you be? I just couldn't stop thinking about you. Are you busy now? I am. Oh, I see. How old is your daughter? She's in 7th grade. This is for her. One a day, after breakfast. Oh, thank you. The landlord raised the rent deposit. - How much? - $10,000. So suddenly? What's that? For you. One a day. Makes you smart. You'll need it. I am smart. It's 143. Your height is? My IQ. I'm serious. Don't buy useless stuff like this. I'm about to be homeless. Thanks to you. Hold on a second! How about we work together? That's fraud. I'm a minor. Exactly! At most, it's 100 hours of community service if you get caught. That's not the point. Aren't you the grown-up? That's why I am so calm and practical. You know I don't have money. But she can still live without $100,000. Right? But without it, orphanage and prison are our fate. Hello. - You again? - Yes, it is. Are you sick? My daughter wanted to thank you in person. Hold on. Come in. This is my daughter. Say hello. Hello. Hi. What's your name? Ready for a home run? - Ryu Hyun-jin It's Hyun-jin. Hyun-jin Park. It's Hyun-jin Park. I'll be outside, Dad. - Okay, go on. - Goodbye. Bye. It's puberty. She's shy. She's at that age. She changed after her mom passed. - Just perfect. - How many did you hook up with? That's harsh! You know what my nickname is? Milk Duds. Everything I do is a dud. It all went up in smoke. But here's the thing. Every single time that happens, a lady comes to my rescue. You want your dad's insurance money or no. - Yes. - Shake. What's your favorite food? Don't have any. So gray. You either love it or hate It. - Spicy! - What's wrong? Spicy? I gotcha with the chilies. What was that? Dad said, write "patience" 3 times and eat, then things get easier. Bro, what have you done to your girl? Hey, don't you hold it in. It'll only give you cancer. Why did you fight with my dad? Did your dad say that? I never knew my father. He passed away so young. Your dad was my father. Very scary and strict. When I used his money for my album, I got caught. He beat me up and my show got canceled. So I left home. Were you blond when you left? How did you know? I saw Dad staring hard at something at the hospital. It was a man with short hair, dyed blond. I asked him who it was, but he wouldn't say. All done. I've loved you for so long, I will never forget you. Here's your popcorn. - Ow! - Whoa! I'm sorry. Jum-hee. What a surprise! Yes. I'm so sorry. It's okay. Leave It. Hyun-jin! I'll do it. It's nice to run into you here. Where are you headed now? Well... Have you eaten? Huh? Why don't you join us? You must've been hungry. So you're 14? Born in 2003? No, I started school early. When's your birthday? February 6. Hyun-jin, a bun. Zoom! When she was born, it started snowing. It was a beautiful day. I'm going to the restroom. It's not easy. She's always apathetic. In fact, I'm worried. No friends, always in her room. I hope she's not bullied. With no woman at home... Jum-hee, excuse me. When you're older, friends are useless. Husbands and kids come first and friends last. Don't let it get to you that you don't have friends now. Okay. It's different this time. Okay. Hang up, I've got to go. Yeah, okay. I'm sorry. You two look happy. You lived in Shanghai? And you're fluent in Chinese? Yes, a little bit. Wo shi Wu Zhan Xi. Xu yao yao qing lian xi wo. How's my pronunciation? - You stunned me just now. - Huh? "Shi" is very hard to pronounce, but you got it perfectly. - You're just saying that. - Feichang hao. Xiexie. Why did you tell her about Shanghai and Chinese? Then why did you tell her I don't have friends? To make her feel bad! Besides, you don't have any friends. I do so! You think you know me? You have no idea. This isn't working. I'm out. What are you talking about? I'm nervous and uneasy. You're on your own. Oh, whoa. A bump. Better be careful. Sorry, sorry. Here's another. Watch it. Hyun-jin's unwell. Let's go another time. I insisted, but she begged me to go. She said she needs time alone. Don't stay up late. - Your uncle He's having a field day. Whoa. I'm all right. I'm all right. It's freezing. Did you call for a driver-for-hire? I did. Let's wait in the car. It's okay. Wait... Ow, wait. That'll be $3. Three times a day after meals. - Thank you. - Have a nice day. The pharmacist lady. Hew about dinner with Hyun-jin at my place this Friday? Okay, nice. Leave it. The key is to make her want it. If I keep coming on to her, she'll just run the other way. Come on in. Thank you. It's almost done. Will you wait a moment here? Of course. Jum-hee, you need a hand? Oh, no no. Why don't we eat out? Or let's order in. No, Jum-hee. This is my expertise. Leave it to me. You rest. I shouldn't have tried something new. I'm good at other dishes. Thank you. Are you hungry? You want some fruits? I'm all right. Does he cook for you at home? His beef ribs are okay. It's not great or anything. This is definitely different. You go to the pharmacist for meds and Chef Park for food. What restaurant are you planning? A Japanese restaurant. When I open, you'll be my first guest. I wasn't expecting anyone. Excuse me. Go on without me. Sure. Sis. I brought kimchi. Why don't you answer your phone? Ow, my back. Give me some water. That's the least you can do. - You have guests? - Who? Sis, see you on Sunday! Go on. Take care. - Bye, sis! - Good evening. I'm Jum-hee's friend. Oh, hello. - We're her sisters-in-law. - Lovely to meet you. This is my daughter. Honey? I've got to go. Good evening. - Oh, hi. - Hello. We're doomed. What? Why? The lies are getting out of hand. Leave the lies to me. You just focus on how to react. Kid, this isn't such a horrid thing. When you spend time with someone, you're giving them a piece of your life you'll never see again. I'm going to see a friend. You go to bed. You did good. I'm nearby. Will you come out or can I come up? - Jae-gu I wanted to apologize for the last time. But I didn't have time alone with you today. You must think I'm an old prude. Jum-hee. Don't ever say that. Don't even think that. Do you know how attractive, beautiful, and special you are? It's been 14 years. Jum-hee, do you know what udumbara plant is? Hmm? Udumbara blooms once in a thousand years. You too are blooming for the first time in a very long time. You're the same person. You're right. That shows you care. Until he called my name, he was only a gesture. When he called my name, he became a flower to me... - What is it? - My leg. - Huh? - My leg... - What about it? - Cramp... Not that one. You'll be fine. Hold on. Look at me and breathe. Jum-hee! Look at me. Let's breathe now. You'll be okay. Coming home so early? You're still up? You need sleep to grow. You've been to Jum-hee's? What did you do? What do you think? Beats me. It's nice and sunny today. It is. You're an excellent driver, Jae-gu. You see, I'm rarely 'un'excellent at anything. Don't ever get a driver's license. I'll drive you forever. Stand up and say "Long live Grandpa." Bow! Long live Grandpa! Turn around and go back to your seats. Mr. Park, have a glass. Allow me. You are Hyun-su? It's Hyun-jin. Okay, Hyun-jin. You're small for a 7th grader. You should eat more. Eat until you can't anymore, okay? Mr. Park, where did you meet my sister-in-law? What do you like about her? You look a bit younger. I don't think age matters. - Right, right. - Aww, sweet. - I met her at a hiking club. - Oh, mountains! Someone handed her a rice cake. She chucked it when no one was looking. It was really funny and cute. I couldn't stop thinking about it. Why, here's to you! He's so into her. - Jum-hee. - Yes. Boring, isn't it? And awkward too. It's always been Dad and me. I've never seen so many relatives. Me too. I only came because it's my dad's 80th birthday. - Am I not heavy? - No and I won't let you down! Whoa. Yikes! - Sir, you know Rome? - I sure do. I swear by Augustus of Rome to take care of Jum-hee! ♪ When it blossoms in spring, ♪ ♪ you said you'd be here ♪ ♪ Like a singing swallow ♪ ♪ Over the hill I hear happy chirpings ♪ ♪ but no word of you ♪ ♪ I still stand on the hill alone ♪ Who do we have here? My girl, Kyung-un! What are you doing? Hyun-jin! See how he loves his daughter? ♪ You have the wings of a swallow ♪ Can't sleep? No. You want to play Truth or Dare? Recently, I started to like someone. Truth or Dare? Truth. Same question for you. Don't be a copycat. Truth. That person is in this room. - Pass. - You can't do that! I'll tell you a secret instead. I have a driver's license. - But you can't drive? - I can drive. I was good but can't drive anymore after my car accident. I survived but my daughter died. Jum-hee. Yeah? Never trust completely. Trust who? Anyone. I'm sleepy now. Good night. Where is Jum-hee? She went home. She said not to wake you. Hey. Why don't you marry her? Are you still sleepy? Go back to sleep. You know what? I like her. Where are we going? An awesome place. Kyung-un. Come on, hurry. Seriously. It's gorgeous here in the spring. These are all cherry blossoms. - I want to go home. - Why? It's just over there. It's freezing. Yeah? But it's almost time. Hold this. - I'll be right back. - Wait! I won't be long! Watch out for ghosts! There. Shall we? Let's go. Whoa. Kyung-un, we're here. It's nothing. Right, it's nothing. Five, four, three, two, one. Bang! Bang! See that? That was all me. Whew, that was exhausting. Kyung-un. Do as I do. Close your eyes. And now, open your eyes! You saw that? When I was born, how did my mom react? I will do exactly what she did. Watch me. This is you, and I'm your mom. See the tears? I should've been an actor. In real estate, it's first signed, first served. Hello, sir. Yokocho Japanese restaurant? It's not signed yet. Enjoy. I'm Chef Hwang. Come greet your customer! Welcome! Please have a seat here. What's your specialty? Everything. I'm just that damn good! Jae-min, is everything going okay? You can't get emotional like you did last time. It's all going great. I went to Ho Chi Minh and Da Nang. Vietnam is so cheap. Everything's cheap, nice, and the food is good. - Is pho cheap too? - Dirt cheap. Come on in. Darling, give me a sedative. What's wrong with you? My heart's pounding. Didn't you say you know someone at the Ministry of Justice? Yeah, my cousin. What for? Remember Mr. Park from the hiking club? The funny, fat one? Weren't you dating him? I was... But I can't reach him. I was so stupid. He told me to invest in stocks based on his tip. Did you? How much? Oh my God! No! Could you ask your cousin to find out? What am I going to do? Jum-hee. You left your door open. It's dangerous, my delicate Jum-hee. Jum-hee. Are you unwell? You look pale. Thank you. At pharmacies, we sell medicine as well as poison. I spiked your juice with poison. Answer me truthfully and you'll have your antidote. Jae-min Hwang. Did you approach me intentionally? Jum-hee. It's not like that. I don't know what you heard, but it's a misunderstanding. Your name, age, job. It was all a lie. Was it fun? Wait. What I said about poison was a joke. Thanks to you, I had fun too. Can't you knock? Kyung-un, I don't care. What did you tell Jum-hee? Tell her what? Oh, Kyung-un. There are things you can say and can't say when you're doing business. I think you said what you shouldn't have. What did you say that she treats me like a bug? It's better this way. She's too good to deceive. - You should stop and... - Hey, hey. Why don't you listen? I asked you a question. You never listen but always say what you want. And you've never once called me Uncle, have you? What are you always so pissed about? You're no uncle. Wasn't it money you were after? You've never visited Dad. You only wanted money. Do what you want to do. Get out! Yeah, I came for the money. But I pity an orphan like you so I stayed. Understand? You're an orphan too! The rent is cheap here! $10,000 deposit and $200 a month. With a shared bathroom. No wonder. - Anyone home? - Someone's here. Excuse me. Kyung-un? It's her. Now I have a face to a voice. Do I know you? I'm from the court to check on your guardian. Is your uncle home? Oh, he isn't home right now. Can I talk to him on the phone? He ran away with the insurance money. - Hey! - What? If he doesn't come to court by this week, he'll be criminally charged. Your uncle could go to prison. Jenny in Banpo Failed Where did you go? You have nowhere to go. Self-control Closed. We apologize for the inconvenience. Who is it? Jum-hee, it's me. You hate me, don't you? I know. My name is Kyung-un. Kyung-un Hwang. I loved spending time with you. Thank you. Jae-min? What are you eating? Loneliness. That won't fill your stomach. Come and have lunch. Good afternoon. Table for one? Are you... Caesar by any chance? Who are you, kid? Have some more. Augustus, someone's here for you. Who? Ta-da! I love stir-fried squid! Your daughter? Who is this girl? His daughter? If you don't appear in court, you'll go to prison. Says who? Tell your story in court and go live your life. I'm going to live mine. You want to go see your mom? Aren't you out of gas? I saw a gas station earlier. What if the car stops? The light is a scare tactic. I still got a good 30 km. Aren't you gonna get out? That-won't wreck the car. Slam it harder. Like this! Is that the house? Yeah, I think so. It's grand. You only have good things to come now, Kyung-un. And you won't be able to reach me anymore. I'm off to Shanghai for a job next month. What? I left your mom's gift in the car. I'll be right back. Who is it? Hey! Jae-min Hwang! Why are you here? Don't go without me. I'm going to Shanghai next month. I can't take care of you. Who asked you? Are you sure the address is correct? When are you gonna pay my money back? I'll send it from Shanghai as soon as I get it. You said you give a piece of your life. You made it sound like you meant it. Jum-hee and I too gave you pieces of our lives. You insisted on guardianship and now you won't care for me. That's why my life is like this. Were you waiting for me? Why would I do that? What were you doing then? I haven't had fresh air in a while. I was enjoying my cytonphide or phytoncide stuff. You ran out of gas. I told you so. Want to go with me? It's at least 3 hours to the gas station. Well, let's go. Hey, you have reception on your phone? No. Man. I want something sweet. Milk Duds? Sounds great.
