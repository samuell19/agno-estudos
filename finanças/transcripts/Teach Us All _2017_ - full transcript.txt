You know when my brother died in 2008, it was like Bradley, you gotta get it together. He came from the exact same place that I came, and he didn't get the proper education that he needed. ♪ Carry me home when the light in my eyes does fade ♪ He ended up dying with a part time job at Taco Bell, and I don't want to end up like that. ♪ Take me away ♪ Most kids are not gonna be killed by police. Most kids will never be beaten by police. Most kids will not go to jail. Millions, and millions of black and Latino kids will go through a public education system that does not educate them. The future of this country will be determined by what happens in the schools. That's how serious it is. ♪ Home ♪ In 1957, a group of black students in Little Rock, Arkansas took a courageous stand for educational equality. The things that people said were shocking. The things that they did, the threats that they made were all terrifying. Nobody really seemed to be in favor of this move to shift from segregation to desegregation. I had not seen the kind of virulent hatred that occurred here both outside and inside the school. Today, their promise remains unfulfilled. ♪ Lay down my bones knowing I'll be in a better place ♪ This is not a Little Rock story or even a Southern one. This is our American story. I don't know how we're gonna be that United States of America if we continue to put our kids in situations where we're constantly divided. When we come to school, it's kinda like hard for us to survive in the school system because we know that the school system is kinda like against us. We have to fight to get a quality education. Children in segregated schools are less likely to graduate high school, more likely to go to jail, and earn on average of 25% less over their lifetimes. I know kids in my class that got arrested that summer before they even got to high school, and they never had that teacher that really cared. So you have underqualified teachers plus underserved schools, and you expect the kids to do well? We're one of the few countries in the world that systematically and deliberately spends less money to educate poor children than affluent children. With every year a student falls behind, it gets harder and harder to catch up. ♪ Carry me home when the light in my eyes does fade ♪ Once we're pushed out of schools, it's like no coming back from that because they feel like they don't have a second chance. Without a quality education, these students will not acquire the skills they need for 21st century jobs. This will leave them poor, and marginalized for their entire lives, and this will affect all of us. Like the cycle is going to keep going until someone really puts a stop. It's up to us to empower each other. If adults will make the central change that needs to happen, then it is up to us as students to create that essential change. Our schools are still the key battleground of the civil rights movement, and our students have always been on the frontline. This is Little Rock then. On September 4th, 1957, a 15-year-old girl, an Elizabeth Eckford approached Central High in Little Rock, Arkansas for her first day of school. She was among a small group of African American students known as the Little Rock Nine, chosen to desegregate the all-white Southern high school. Three years earlier in 1954, landmark Supreme Court case Brown versus the Board of Education had declared segregation in schools unconstitutional. Prior to 1954, I mean going all the way back to the year 1619, when the first shipload of Africans were brought over here to become enslaved people. It was considered legal, and constitutional to discriminate. So that law change was monumental. I knew that as a 13-year-old kid, I understood that. So I had also sure knowledge that hundreds of people before I had lived had died in the fight for freedom. I could not as a person, who benefited from that sacrifice say no to this opportunity. But on that morning, in September 1957, a mob of white segregationists gathered to stop the Little Rock Nine from attending school. The crowd shouted racial slurs, and chanted, "Two, four, six, eight, we ain't gonna integrate." I was surprised at the crowd. I went up to my home room, and on the third floor, I was looking out the window at the crowd. At that point, it didn't register with me what a dangerous situation it was. Even with all the people out there, it didn't register with me. One of the boys in my class whose father was very prominent was standing next to me at the window, and he said, "I am just sick at my stomach that they're gonna let those people in here." Why, I saw pure hatred, absolute spittle coming out of the mouth, eyes blazing, mouths opened, words you can't imagine. I looked around, and I saw a woman, who looked like she had a kind face, and I was gonna ask her for help, and she spat on me. They used weapons, and they used physical force. They pushed, shoved, kicked, spit, you know, sliced. Acid in the face, all kinds of stuff. I was glad I had on those sunglasses. At least some people would not see me crying. Arkansas Governor, Orval Faubus, activated the state's National Guard to support the segregationists mob. Governor Faubus called out the National Guard to maintain order. "They will not act as segregationists or integrationists," he said. But in effect, they were there to bar Negro students from the school. Governor had said they were there to keep the peace but they were not there to keep the peace. They were there to block our entry. In the weeks following, the Little Rock Nine repeatedly attempted to enter Central High, while violent crowds camped out in protest, supported by the Guard, and Little Rock Police. Still the nine kept kept trying. I didn't want to go back. I wanted to leave every second of everyday. I wanted to run out there screaming but one half of my brain, I would say, what amount of counter argument? That was a strong argument. The job's not over, you can't quit now. There's too much at stake. Images of the students being were featured on nightly national news, serving to further polarize a country running high on racial tension. When these photographs were shown around the world, President Eisenhower said he had to react. He said, "Mob rule could not prevail." He sent 1,000 paratroopers from Port Campbell, Kentucky here and here took federal control of the Arkansas National Guard. The armed soldiers escorted the Little Rock Nine into the high school on September 25th. It was a precedent-setting moment in US history. A standoff between the federal government, and a state governor that resulted in a triumph for the Civil Rights Movement. It felt like the government cared. But the victory did not last. That was simply the beginning of all hostility, and from that point on, we were marked. The word was, you have to leave or if you don't leave voluntarily, we will kill you. Each of us was assigned, what was assigned a soldier guard. They were effective witnesses should they choose to be but most of the time, people were able to attack us at will. It was hellish throughout the school year. They knew that they needed to do well in school. That was the whole purpose of them going through that. That was the reason for this sacrifice because education is the key to success. It still is. I still have a variety of different emotions. You could say I just have a rainbow of emotions because then there are times when I see the manifestations of the trauma that she experienced come out, and that's really, it disturbs me because I feel like they sacrificed so much, and there's no way to give them back their innocence. When you are being attacked, and people turned their backs, and don't react to what they had to have heard, and or seen, it makes one feel as though they feel that you're getting what you deserve. So now, when people say that they welcome us, , as I heard 50 years later, I said, well I'm glad to know that now. Why you should keep it to yourself? Let's move on. On May 25th, 1958, Earnest Green became the first black student to graduate from Little Rock Central High. For the rest of the Little Rock Nine, major challenges lay ahead. By the end of the school year, I was determined to go back. I had learned how to survive, and I also knew that one year wasn't gonna prove anything. That this needed to be a continuous process. So I was ready to go back. It was at that point that the governor stepped in, and stymied all of our plans because he decided because he was so adamantly opposed to continued desegregation, he closed all the high schools in Little Rock. During what became known as The Lost Year, private schools using public taxpayer funds opened to accommodate the city's white students, more than 90% of whom found some form of schooling that year. No such options emerged for the city's black students, 50% of whom received no education at all. Many of them joined the military or found work, never returning to school. Little Rock's public schools reopened a year later. Only two of the Little Rock Nine returned to Central High. They were joined by a few other African American students, including Sybil Hampton. I was the first of the African American students, who spent their entire high school experience there at Central High. The way it began was the way it ended. That was that no one in any class ever spoke to me during those three years. What happened is that I was shunned, we were shunned. Of my experience is I never described it as integration. It was never intended that we will be treated as equals. This is Little Rock now. Growing up at the neighborhood that I grew up in, there weren't really a lot of opportunities. It was if you'll be a sports player or a dope dealer, or you end up dead or incarcerated. So you got like four options 'cause my parents worked a lot that all the neighborhood kids would come to my house. It weren't really a safe environment when you got drug dealers, and everybody else around your house. So I mean in order to stay safe, they came to my house, and nobody had guns. It's been 60 years since US soldiers were deployed to Little Rock to escort black kids into an all-white school. Such a show of federal force seems unimaginable today, and yet the city's schools remain a battleground in the fight for equity, and social justice. The State Board of Education has taken over the Little Rock school district. A tie-breaking vote cast by the State Board of Education's chair and the entire Little Rock school board sent packing. The motion by member Vicki Saviers came after a proposition for partnership failed at a tie vote. No bold action of improvement has occurred to change the direction of this school. I was really, I guess, a driver in this or maybe the initiator because of my background, and because I just felt like there had to be a complete restart. This district was at a point of dysfunction, and so there was this super battle over who's in charge of the district, Who's running this place? We start looking at this Little Rock school district budget. I mean it's almost $400 million a year. I'm thinking, "I'm in and out of all these schools, the facilities are so bad. Where's all this money going?" Despite all these years, with a lot of money, put into the public school fund, and sent to schools, we still have an achievement gap between primarily our poor kids, and our middle-end upper income children. While most agreed something needed to be done to fix Little Rock schools, much of the public reacted with alarm to the takeover. Especially in the African American and Latino communities, they had no sense that this conversation was coming up. This was all rolled out in such a quick manner, two weeks between when we said we would decide this, and then the ultimate decision. A group of plaintiffs led by long time civil rights lawyer, John Walker, quickly organized to sue the state. I say it was a racially motivated decision because they got rid of them. Of a majority black board. How can a parent have a voice if there's no school board? You're talking three individuals controlling the entire district, the largest district in the state of Arkansas. Three individuals. Which one of them is going to down to the most poverty stricken neighborhood in Little Rock, Arkansas and have a conversation with a parent there? It's not gonna happen. I have to worry more about children succeeding than giving someone an opportunity to be on the school board. The Arkansas Supreme Court ruled that the Department of Education was immune from any lawsuit regarding the state takeover. Meanwhile-- There was a house bill introduced shortly after the takeover, which would make it legal for any school district taken over by the state to basically be turned over to a charter school company. House Bill 1733 failed to pass after much public outcry but Arkansas school reform movement is taking proactive steps to expand Little Rock's charter school offerings. When I see the charter schools in Little Rock just filling another niche for choice that people are just hungry for as many options as possible 'cause they're trying to find the right fit for their kid. Although the waiting list for charter schools are long and diverse, they represent another point of contention in an already fractured community. For those people who made some really poor choices and poor decisions over the past 30 years in Little Rock school district, the fighting, the constant arguing, deciding who's gonna be in charge, the black board, the white board, which lawsuit are we gonna end up with now, it was only a distraction for the kids. It hurt the children most of all. This is what I have to say. Following the 2015 state takeover, we visited Little Rock to find out where things stand today. My mother used to tell me when I was coming up she was like, "Bradley, you have two strikes. One you're male, and one you're black. Anybody going to have to give you nothing for that." She said, "Bradley, you just gotta keep on pushing through it." I've lost more people than there are kids in my graduating class. Instantly got to a point right now to where I'm deciding, man, I don't know how I made it, and they didn't, you know. We have, I think very real racial issues. We don't know each other. Black and white people do not know each other in Little Rock. Beginning in the 1950s, when public housing projects were initiated, white families were literally moved to the west part of Little Rock, and black families were moved to the east part of Little Rock. How can we have a school that's 93, 97% white? How is that possible? Unless we're doing some things intentionally to make it so. People moved their children. People voted with their feet. They have all these wonderful new facilities, and black kids are now left, where in the schools that white people discarded. The school that I went to is in Southwest Little Rock. It's on the 5000 block of Southwest Little Rock. It's called Geyer Springs Elementary. All the kids from all the bad neighborhoods went there. So like I already lived in the bad neighborhood. So I mean I had to fight everyday I walked to school, fight everyday I walked home. Then my stepdad and my mom kind of were going through a tough time in their relationship. So I mean it was just like yelling. They'd keep me up all night. Then I got like real hooked on alcohol, like really, really, really, really bad. So I mean it was just like chaotic. So when I got to school, I was just like, I don't care about learning. These teachers don't understand what I'm going through. They don't even try to understand what I'm going through. It was cruel that they didn't. The school's where the most disadvantaged kids function have all the new teachers, all the turnovers. You go to the poorer areas of our state. They can't find teachers. On individual said, "We just have to depend on warm bodies sometimes here." That one statement stuck with me more than anything than I heard the whole time. We just have to depend on warm bodies. Teacher quality, teacher effectiveness is the single most important in-school factor that will determine how a young person does in school. You've got to figure out a way to make sure that the most in need students, whether it's academically in need, or disadvantaged or whether it's economically disadvantaged have access to the highest quality of teachers. So we went looking for just that. I want to have children one day. I want my children to go to a school that's racially diverse, that's socio-economically diverse, that's categorically high achieving. I'm looking around Arkansas, and I'm not seeing a good example. So guess what that means? I better provide one. We found one school that represents both the endemic failure of the school district, and quite possibly it's very hope for salvation. During the summer of 2015, Baseline Academy, Little Rock's lowest performing elementary school was entirely reconstituted. 27-year-old Jonathan Crossley was appointed principal. He'd never been a principal before. I didn't see that as a drawback, I saw that as an actually an opportunity. We went after him, and we weren't shy about it. We told him we wanted to work with him. We wanted to help him be all he could be. He has a heart for service. I think it is immoral for the system, for our structure of education to not send the best that we have into every single school in the state of Arkansas, and the country at large. So that's why I'm here. If I am one of the best educators in the state, then I should be in a school that needs me. The youngest ever Arkansas Teacher Of The Year, Jonathan had just two months to hire and train 40 new teachers. Five, four... I wanted to teach children, who otherwise would not have had maybe the greatest of education from because where their zip code is. Because it's hard, and it's a sad fact that it's hard to find really qualified teachers to come to areas to teach children that are difficult to teach. I read the proposal for Baseline, the redesign of the school further, and it talked about the intensive professional development that they will provide for the new staff. It talk about that children will be able to learn things in a different more meaningful way. I was thinking, hey, I like to be a part of it. I like to be a part of that turnaround, that transition, that change. That's what I'm building this model at Baseline around. It's supporting teachers, giving them voice, and making sure they are professionally developed every single day to be the best versions of themselves because these students can't wait another day. A mere eight miles from Central High, Baseline Academy is home to roughly 60% Latino, and 40% African American students, all of them low-income. Many of them recent immigrants. I'm wasn't born here. It was hard. In El Salvador, it was hard. because there were a lot of bad people. So, it's better here? Are you glad you're here? Come here. I'm happy you're here. We had issues, we have homelessness issues. We have violence issues. It's not the environment that a kid should be raised in. This is not like a pretty good safe environment. You have children saying, you know, "Ms. Harnish, I have a quarter, is that enough to buy a book at the book fair?" And you just want to cry. So you dig in your wallet, and you give them $10 because you want them to have a book. They want to learn, and to have, you know, these families who want to provide for their children so badly, and they just do not have the extra money for those sort of things. It's very difficult to learn when your needs are not being met. It's feeding children, brushing their teeth. I have hygiene bags I send home, and we have to think about, think about things like that. We have a lot of students that needs someone that loves them. They need to know that there's someone there that supports them, and kind of rooting for them. So many people give up on our students, and they give up on children. They just say, "Oh well, this is just the way it is, and they're gonna be this way." Without taking into account that if you will just push them a little more, love them a little more, and encourage them, motivate them, inspire them, they can, and they will. So I think about my identity as an elementary school principal. I think about the fact that I'm the first in my family to go to college, and the fact that I grew up in a low income community. So then I think about the system that we're in in Arkansas, and in the nation at large. Are the leaders in those systems? Leaders that are, their identities are wrapped up in equity. If that were the case, it'll be a little more urgent. I want to see some urgency, and that's why I'm at Baseline Academy. Baseline is one school in one city. But it represents far too many of our communities. See I was born in 1941, and I saw the craziness around me then. It's the same craziness I see around me now. In my world, not too much has changed. For me, as a person who made an incredible sacrifice as a teenager to endure what I endured, it's been very startling. I thought that in a broader world, people would develop a consciousness of being a part of something bigger than themselves. With the black since, we're back to where we were a year or so before Martin Luther King was assassinated. But it's not a story of progress, it's a story of total inequality of schooling. Separate but equal never became the truth. So the idea that we can create equitable schools in a segregated society is a myth. Show me where it's happening, it's not happening anywhere. And divided, we failed. At the height of school desegregation in 1988, the black/white achievement gap was at its narrowest. Since then the gap began to widen again. So one has to believe one of two things. You either have to believe that there are hardly any intelligent black and Latino kids or in a country with a long history of racial caste, that we are simply remaking that racial caste in our schools. Segregation is really, really corrosive in terms of giving lies to everybody. It lies to the outside world by saying these kids because they haven't achieve enough, must not be competent. Those who say it's not an issue, it's because they lack the will. They lack the will of Dwight Eisenhower, a Republican President, a general, who's willing to send troops to Little Rock, Arkansas, to require it. We haven't seen a leader with that kind of resolve in a long time. Everybody will say, "Well, we don't mean for people to be apart. We're not doing it on purpose." Well, you might not be doing it on purpose, and you might be doing whatever you think is the best for your child to not get that, but don't make that decision thinking that you're not having an impact on the whole. Take some responsibility for what happens to the whole. This is a tale of too many cities. I leave my house around 6:20 in the morning, only because it's around an hour and 20 minute commute. Now I come home super late, and I arrive at my desk at seven. I have friends that got into like pretty average high schools in the Bronx, and they hate it. So I definitely think I would have gotten the education that I have now, where I go to school has shaped my life completely for the better. But it would have been nice if there has been options around me. At the time, I didn't feel like there was. New York City. This iconic melting pot is home to 1.1 million students of countless races, ethnicities and cultures. Yet, it has the most segregated schools in America. Of the tale of two cities, tale of two schools, you have some schools that perform quite well, you have other schools that perform quite poorly. New York is among the most ethnically diverse cities in the entire world. So why are so many of the public schools so segregated? This is the case all across the Northeast because of acute residential segregation, which is far worse in the North, than in the South due to decades of discriminatory housing policies. In New York City, we don't talk like here, you never, it's so '90s to talk about race when it comes to color. We don't do that here. We talk about it in money. It's about how much you make, and how much you don't make. The excuses that you often hear in New York City, and other place in the North is about housing. It's about where people can live. It's about class, black and Latino kids are more likely to be poor, and that it's not an issue of race at all. But we know, the data shows one that's simply not true. That there are a lot of poor white students, and they're not living in neighborhoods of concentrated poverty in cities, and they're not attending schools with concentrated poverty in the city. In our campus, the John Jay Campus, we have four schools in the building. One school that came in three years ago, Millennium Brooklyn, their parents are mostly middle class and upper middle class parents. Some of us called it Apartheid High. They got millions of dollars of startup money that we did not get when we started. The schools at the state has been starving out of funding. Those are the same schools that continue to fail, and the same schools they want to close. With roughly 18,000 public schools, New York City practices school choice, meaning that after sixth grade, students can apply to any school across the city. It sounds good, it sounds good for black parents trapped in segregated neighborhoods with underperforming schools. The problem is choice has never really been shown to benefit black and Latinos, and poor parents in mass. I don't know, my school around like 5,000 apply each year, only around 272 get in, making it more competitive than Harvard. You have guidance counselors that are telling you, I know mine did, just like, "Guys, you don't have a chance to go to this school. Only affluent kids or like rich kids can go. You know white kids go." People tell these kids this. Choice relies on the fact that parents will be more actively engaged. In New York City, you may have to apply to the school. You may have to submit a portfolio. Some of them have interview times, where you actually have to leave work, and show up at the school at a certain time in order to be able to apply. Clearly, these are things that are gonna benefit parents who are more middle class, parents who are not working hourly wages, parents who are most engaged. Like a lot of just minority parents don't understand the admissions process. I had to do mine by myself. I had to look through this like 200-page book, and I have no idea where to start. So like one thing they told us to look at was the graduation rates. That's how I decided I wanted to go to this school. I am in now. My parents realized that it will be like an hour and a half away. They really got upset. They were like, "We would have like for you to go to school around here." My response at the time was, the schools around here are considered bad. While parents struggle to navigate this complex system, schools are making their own choices. We had one parent that went in asking for admission process, and was told one thing, and then they had another parent that was only Spanish-speaking, went in for the same information, and was given a totally different answer, and they were just a minute apart. Why do you think they're trying to keep certain kids out of the school? Once again, a lot, like people said money sometimes does talk more in this community. What control choice means to me is that even though the school across the street from me has the best program for my kid, he can't go there. Good evening, everybody. Hi. Can anyone hear me? Loud and proud, I got you. I have to give you all a shout out, because your schools here are the bomb. Thank you. Absolutely. It's one thing if you're able to afford in a capitalist society to put your child into a private school with other wealthy kids but when you are talking about a public system, you should not be able to buy into a school where every kid is wealthy, and almost every kid is white and Asian, in a district that is the opposite of that. While much of the residential segregation over the last several decades occurred as a result of white flight out of cities, today we are witnessing the opposite phenomenon. What we know about gentrification is as whites and affluent people start to move into communities of color, what they will do is cluster in schools, and those schools will become little islands of privilege. You know, we can't do much about gentrification but we can use it as an opportunity to create more integrated schools. Meet Jill Bloomberg, the principal of Park Slope Collegiate, historically, a black and Latino high school. I was approached by a parent from the neighboring elementary school, PS 321, and her request to me was, "would you be willing to accept a group of students from 321?" The idea being that that people are interested in your school but they would feel better if nobody's child was the only white kid in the school. We all actively wanted to be there, and make a statement in a way around why integration matters, and why inclusive education is really 21st century education. That was the best way to get the students that we currently have what they need because unfortunately, having white people in the school is your best way of getting the finances that you need. In the fall of 2013, 10 white sixth graders integrated Park Slope Collegiate. That was pretty much a first. We went from essentially having 0% white students to having 25% white students to no major fanfare. Unlike the Little Rock Nine, the Park Slope 10 were welcomed by their black and Latino peers. Our reputation or applicant pool started to change dramatically, which is an interesting comment on how people evaluate a school. I think the biggest issues come from the external structural issues around a good school versus a bad school, and what a good school looks like, and what a bad school looks like. By having white families come there that first year, it was confusing to the community. So you're like what are you thinking like you're gonna send your kid to that building with metal detectors? Like aren't you petrified and scared? I'm like no, it's a great learning community, and you should come check it out. By the 2015-16 school year, the incoming sixth grade class was over 50% white putting it in just two years at a dangerous tipping point that threatens to push out the most vulnerable kids. We are extremely interested in being and remaining an integrated school but if it's just left up to the choice process, we're not gonna be an integrated school for very long. So I just think it's so important for schools to be integrated 'cause you learn about people and not about what you think they like, or what you think they are, what you see them do on TV. But if I didn't go to an integrated school, I wouldn't be able to break down those stereotypes. I learned about other people's races or other people's cultures from going to this school. It's just really cool. My kids are in a school that they're getting not only like a rigorous academic experience but they're learning about racism directly. They're learning about different culture and people, and not in a Kumbaya kind of way. I mean like they're learning how to be anti-racist children. The purpose of creating a multi-racial school is to create the kind of multi-racial unity that we need to combat racism. ♪ Just a little bit ♪ Jill's students are working together to combat racism by opposing the metal detectors in their school. If you compare the schools, the demographics of the schools that have metal detectors to the demographics of the schools that don't have metal detectors, you will see the same race and class divide. That's a horrible, horrible message to give to students. That comes directly from the State. I would like not to have scanners in our public schools. There's really no evidence at least that they've been able to provide that the scanners keep the school safer? I always thought to myself, well, if you're trying to keep us safe, then why don't you have scanners in all the schools, and try to keep everybody safe? The first person I see everyday is the security guard. I want an education and if I don't need a gun to get an education, don't scan me everyday for a gun. It sort of feels like you're in prison when you're not in prison, you're in school. You have a whole school crying out that we do not need these metal detectors by telling you that we feel like criminals. We're telling you that we're here to get an education, and still yet nobody's doing anything about it. So it makes me sad like you guys really don't care. In some way, we're forgetting that there are one million students that were talking about when we talk about a policy or we talk about initiative. We're talking about one million human beings with incredible potential, agency and intelligence, and we're not speaking to them. The Bronx Academy of Letters is located in the poorest congressional district in the country, and a neighborhood where few white students ever set foot. Here a community organizer turned principal, and committed teachers aimed to give their students leadership in New York's first school equity debate. They want to know why every public school in New York City does not have the same resources. I want to know too. It seems like a naive question but it really is why there's a public good. Why is it not fairly allocated across a city for all of the youth? We should approach the struggle for integration not as an academic or abstract question but how does it actually unfold in the lives of the students? The students were clear that it affects every aspect of school life. From the most basic stuff right, like what kind of school lunch menu do you have? What after school activities do you offer? How many sports teams does the school have? That to me is the, is really kind of cultivating a school where the resources of the city are fairly distributed. We have a vision that one day all high schools in New York City will be equal. In integrated schools, 37.4% of students are more likely to pass college course, course exams, whereas in segregated schools, only 16.8% passed these college courses. Minority schools have 2/3 of the teacher that have old certification and licensing requirement predominantly minority schools have 15% larger classes than predominantly white schools. You know more about this topic than most of your leaders in public office, which is part of the problem. What I like about your presentation is that it reminds us that diversity is not about changing the way a school looks, it's not an aesthetic problem. It's about changing how our school operates. It's about the distribution of resources, and opportunities. Whenever we go to school everyday, the things that people and officers are passing affect us directly, and we should have a say in what happens. So I wanted to organize kind of a citywide student council. I want our policies, the things that we come up with to shape this city. I was really thinking about why I went into education to really inspire that power, and potential, and intelligence that young people have, and that we so often shadow in the ways that we talk to them, the systems that we build. There have been too many people who have been left out of the question, how can we improve this? Right, and it's been like, oh we can improve this for you. Integrate NYC is really all about bringing the young people to the forefront so that they can show us what needs to be changed. It needs to be student-led. That's what I want to try to do in New York City. Because that's the thing real change happens when the people who need it, lead it. This is for the students lost in the system. Los Angeles, where before there was Brown versus Board of Education, there was Mendez versus Westminster. In 1944, Sylvia Mendez was an eight-year-old Mexican American girl, living in Orange County, who just wanted to go to a nice school. Here we were, going to that horrible Latino Mexican school with dirt all around us, next to the cow pasture. They were teaching us, not the academics, they were teaching us home economics. We were learning how to crochet, how to knit. They wanted us to grow up and be maids. That's what they were teaching us to be. When Sylvia and her brothers were denied entry to their neighborhood's far superior white school, her parents led a community battle, and class action lawsuit that went to the California Supreme Court. At the trial, Orange County superintendents used derogatory terms, and argued that language barriers warranted segregation. But after a fierce fight, the Mendez family won the case in 1946. This was huge. We were talking a case that set the precedent for the Brown decision. Farming family who pretty much led a movement to completely change the futures for all children in California. That's massive. So, seven years before the rest of the nation, California was the first state to be integrated. Today, 70 years later, there are two Southern California schools named after the Mendez family. One of them located in L.A.'s working class Latino neighborhood of Boyle Heights. We have completely gone around in a circle. We're more segregated now than we were in 1947. The school right now, wonderful school that's doing such great things but it's 100% Latino. Did that case live up to its potential ideals? My students will they have the chance to interact with somebody who's Asian, or white, or black? Will they have the chance to share about their cultures, and customs, and what they do. I do see Latinos face stereotypes. They're expected to not really amount to anything as much. So many people think that Latinos don't care about education, and by bringing this forth, you know, the Mendez versus Westminster how five families, five Latino families were fighting for their children. It just shows how much their parents cared, and how Latinos have always cared. I wonder what schools would have looked like today had I think, had our history, the history of our city been more compassionate, more tolerant, more understanding, and I think really lived up to the ideals of the country. ♪ All the time, you say was wasted ♪ ♪ But it was wasted all by you ♪ ♪ All the love, that walked away ♪ ♪ Was really left behind by you ♪ I've lived in South L.A. all my life for like, it's like a system being created to push students out of schools. So they end up being a part the school prison pipeline, drawing it against, and then they end up in prisons. L.A. is in trouble. They're losing kids, they're losing money. They've lost public confidence. If they don't do something quick, they're gonna see the public education will be lost in Los Angeles. This country's reflected inside of this enormous, enormous school system. So more than 100 different neighborhoods, and more than 20 individual cities, including the city of Los Angeles composed Los Angeles unified school district. Over 80% of our kids live in conditions of poverty. We have some of the highest exposure and concentration to trauma of anywhere in the country. My mom she makes about $9,000 a year. It's five of us so you could kind of like imagine what we have to go through to survive. ♪ Down, down so low ♪ ♪ I'm dipping to the ground, and one man did it all ♪ ♪ Down, down so low ♪ ♪ Leaving you crying out, have mercy on my soul ♪ ♪ Oh Lord, down so low ♪ ♪ You've got to find a way to be free ♪ So you can still walk into a high school in Los Angeles regardless of the color of your skin. But I will tell you cannot walk into AP courses, and you cannot have the best-equipped school. So while the front door is open, the classroom door still remains a real, real impactful problem. More than half of K12 students in California are Latino, and one third of LAUSD students are classified as English language learners. They faced what is known as triple segregation. Latino students are particularly at a challenge because the majority of their parents are probably immigrants or have such faith in the system, and trust in their American dreams, promise of education that they don't know how to question it or challenge it, and see if there's something wrong with it. Because we didn't have family to support us. Who to ask how to do things. I like to communicate with people and ask for help, but I always had to find someone that spoke Spanish. And I didn't like that because sometimes the people that spoke Spanish didn't have the information I needed. These kids actually have a rather amazing set of assets. Well, they're bilingual, they're very knowledgable about the different cultures. They're very knowledgable about different contexts and traditions. I mean they are potentially these incredible brokers out there in a globalizing world. Yet, we're treating them as though they're just, they've got deficits and problems, and they're of no use. That's just a tremendous waste. English language learners are often isolated in language classes that prevent them from keeping pace with core content subjects like math and science, making it harder for them to be college ready by graduation. One potential solution to this detrimental separation is dual emergent language programs, which have been gaining traction in recent years. The model is half native English-speaking kids who are hopefully part of the mainstream society, and half kids who come with a language from, home language that is other than English. We're thinking long-term benefits. We're thinking about the future. We're thinking about the 21st century, what is necessary for my kids to be successful. As we live in this global economy, I don't see how we can't offer our kids a bilingual education. In the future, when I'm older and I get a job, there might be some grown-ups that don't speak English, and I can help them translate. When I'm older, I could communicate with other people in different countries. It makes me feel happy to be bilingual. It brings people together in a win-win situation. It is really one of the only ways that is left to us by the courts to actually very systematically, and consciously desegregate our kids. In America, it's not just about integrating across skin color, and social class. It's about integrating different languages, and cultures, and experiences. Latino English learners tend to drop out of school at about twice the rate of all other groups combined. A huge factor is just this sense of belonging or not belonging. But the reality is, in our opinion, that these kids didn't drop out, that the school system didn't do its job to ensure that they got the resources, the classes, the support they needed to succeed in it. In fact, what was happening is they're getting pushed out of the school system. 'Cause we lived South L.A. They say we are bad apple and we're not. You make us a bad apple by kicking us out, leading us, pushing us out from school. You know, following the school to prison pipeline. That's not where we want to end. We want to be in school but how can we focus in schools when we don't have our supports in schools? There are many ways that the schools actually push kids out. Suspension rates, kids who've been suspended frequently get discouraged, and schools often see that as an incentive to get rid of kids that posed a problem. Since 1972, the probability of being suspended during the school year has more than doubled for African American and Latino students. I saw a lot of my friends get pushed out of school for minor things such as going into classrooms, which are hitting on you, and your teacher does not want to deal with you. Not understanding that we come from communities where we might have got banged on right before we came to school. Families are not healthy. People get shot at everyday. So like we have to deal with these conditions, and teachers that don't necessarily understand it. One in three black male babies born in this country is expected to go to jail or prison. The statistic for Latino boys is one in six. These data tell a very weak story that children begin to internalize when they are marginalized, when they are excluded, when they are treated unfairly in our school systems. We have too many schools in this country, where the principals sound like wardens, and the teachers sound like correctional officers. Do we choose to invest in the children's education and their well-being or do we choose to invest in a new prison? They rather put the investment in a prison than put the investment in these communities. ♪ They've been lying to you boy ♪ I know a person like he's my friend, can't afford clothes or anything like he wear a wild T-shirt, and his baggy, and jeans. He can't afford any of this so the police harassed him just because he wearing some type of clothing that relates as a gang member, they treat him as a gang member, and they always harass him. He felt like he's just being violated by the system, the schools, and he want to do is get an education. ♪ You got the world on your shoulders, monkey on your backs ♪ ♪ Haters on your case tryin' to throw you off track ♪ ♪ They preying in your real TV, hit the noise dance ♪ ♪ Simply stay strong, call and tell 'em all ♪ ♪ Feel ♪ In L.A., community based youth-led organizing help reverse the policy of willful defiance, which was leading to disproportionate suspensions of black and Latino students. Where we go. Everywhere we go. People want to know. People want to know. Party for justice. What young people have done is sort of flipped the script. We're not dropouts, we're being pushed out. What we need you to do is to pull us back in instead of pushing us back out. For like, if they show us the actual change every time we fight for it, that will give people to see that what they fight for is worth it. Because of all the work that you all put in here today, that will ensure that student will have mercy in the classroom. They will increase graduation rates. It will put ministers on check... We had like 49,000 suspensions a year, and when we left, we had less than 6,000 suspensions a year. That should be no shock that achievement went up. If you stay with us, you learn. Just like in Sylvia Mendez's day, L.A.'s underserved students are taking their fight to the courts. Matter before the court, Vergara versus State of California and others, council states. Return this for the record please. Good morning Your Honor, Theodore J. Boutrous Jr. for the plaintiffs. Plaintiffs are asking this court to protect their constitutional right to education equality because all children deserve an equal chance to succeed. In this case, what we're talking about is grossly ineffective teachers. Teachers who berate their students or rather than inspire them. The court has described education as the lifeline of both the individual and society because it serves the distinctive and as a bright hope for the entry of the poor and oppressed into the mainstream of American society. It's truly a fundamental interest in our state, and in our society education. Vergara versus California is a case that we brought here in Los Angeles, challenging a series of laws that really we felt were damaging and injuring students. The tenure laws, the dismissal statutes, the layoffs statutes really conspired together to make it so superintendents and principals couldn't manage teachers, and make sure the best teachers were being rewarded, and promoted, and that grossly ineffective teachers, which everybody admitted were in the system could be taken out of the system so they weren't in front of students. You kind of tell that the staff members like they either don't want to deal with you. I mean there's certain staff members that wants to see you succeed but others, it's just like you're here for the day, I get paid whether you want to be here or not. I think at some point where the teachers don't even know their name, and that's really-- Sad. That's sad. Very sad. So that's one thing that we do need in our schools is better teachers. Teachers that are more caring about the student. I've had my experience with both effective and ineffective teachers, and it makes all the difference. My daughter Julia, like all the children in the State of California deserves a good quality education so that she can have an equal opportunity to learn and succeed in life. Julia was great, she was excited to go to school. She's a kid who's always love learning. She was great in kindergarten first grade. We get to second grade, and things start to change. I didn't really understand what was wrong with Julia, and the only difference was she had a different teacher. I went to the principal, I expressed my concerns, and after two weeks, she came back, and she said, "The problem isn't Julia, the problem is the teacher. But she's been here for a long time, and there's nothing we can do about it." The buildup of ineffective teacher after ineffective teacher, which you have no control over eventually just builds up, and you become a lost student in the system. The data was overwhelming that when kids would have a grossly ineffective teacher, it will affect them for the rest of their lives. Their income, their, whether they go to college where they go to college. It was really remarkable. The trial judge found that it shocked the conscience the effects of these statutes were having. Generally speaking, we love our teachers, we love our principals. But at times, it doesn't always work out. It's hard for parents to get that through to the system and have their voices heard on behalf of their children. It's very frustrating. There's a sense of helplessness. For us as a family, it wasn't enough justified for our children. We felt like it was our responsibility to speak out for all children. It was to show to other students who had been in my situation that there is somebody advocating for them. The students won the case but it was later overturned. They took it all the way to California Supreme Court, which in August 2016 declined to hear the case. The ultimate ruling here was a severe injustice to the nine school children I represent, and every kid in California, the legislature is not gonna do anything. It's political gridlock. The students who were affected by these laws can't vote, so they can't affect political change. You have this situation where adults, politicians, government officials are letting these kids down. It's an extreme injustice. This is for all of us. So here we are, 60 years later, and yeah by many measures, and by most accounts, we got it very, very wrong, whether through our prejudices, our ignorance, our silence, our apathy, or our fear that things won't or can't change. When school desegregation happened in the '60s or in the '50s, '60s and '70s, it was difficult and contentious but there was a little bit more commitment to the idea that an injustice to one is an injustice to all. We would do well to remember that. The lessons of history and education can provide a national narrative, the pathway as to how all of us fit in together, and how all of us need to ensure that every young person has the opportunity for a bright future, not just the few. I just say outright, we have to have a whole lot of white folks advocating for doing something about this because that's where the power structure is. We have to do everything in our power to make sure that the educational crisis does not entrap them, and cause them to be stuck, and their dreams to be deferred. But we still have a chance to get it right. Education is just really giving me a driving force. It's really turning my life around. Made me look at things more positively. I'm still a poor kid but I'm making it. If you tell me a poor kid can't learn, I say it, we're gonna always be able to learn as long as there are books out there, we'd be able to learn. There was one teacher that stuck out to me the most. Her name was Mrs. Norman. She just pulled me out one day. She was like, "None of these teachers have asked you where you're from. You sure don't act like the rest of these kids here. You look like a couple of 'em but I can tell that you're not from the exact same place." She asked, she said, "What is your household situation looking like?" I said well, you know, my first house, it didn't have no windows, and no plumbing. So like I had to learn how to provide from less. She was like, "Are you serious?" And all this stuff. So she kind of became a one-on-one mentor and my counselor. She kinda the reason why I started caring more about school. In community after community, we learned this... America's schools are no longer four free standing walls that open at eight, and close at three. They are the very barometers of our nation's health. Our teachers, the vital link to our children's futures. It can't be understated how important the role of a teacher is in shaping a kid's future. My life is literally changing everyday I come into this classroom. This teacher doesn't realize that he's really changing my life, and how I think, and how I see the world. Teachers do more and are expected to do more than ever before. Learners are coming in with different needs It's hard, it's a really hard job. I don't, I think everyone is really good at paying lip service to how hard it is like "Teachers are so great, they work so hard." I don't think people fully understand how challenging it is to take care of someone else's child, and to love them as they move through what is a really difficult time in their lives in adolescence. It's hard. I mean I'm doing those things. I'm putting in the work. I'm providing supports for teachers. I'm giving them time to plan with one another. I'm allowing them to have people in their lives, and their school is helping them with the curriculum. It's helping them teach content. It's still hard. I'm providing interventions for behavior for students who are on the extreme end of the spectrum but it's still hard. It's still hard. That's something that I want to honor going forward. I think the system should do a better job of honoring. It's still hard. Over time, that will wear even the most mission-driven, passionate person down. I think we're seeing that at a broader, and broader scale. I personally, hear what teacher say is like, "I really need support to do a job I love, and care about." I hear teachers all the time express unbelievable concern in regard for students, and really want to do the best job. I currently am working in a segregated school. The opportunity gaps are so great that even the best intentioned teachers really burned out, and the administration is exhausted. It's never good enough. It feels like it's never good enough. Imagine a classroom where 50, 60, 70% of your students are facing some degree of crisis. How much teaching are you really able to get through when you're having to address basic needs? So just sharing the responsibility of caring for the underserved, I think is going to do a lot to facilitate teaching and learning in the classroom. You can't build an entire profession of more than three million individuals based on the good graces of a few. We need to change the structure of the teaching profession to attract, develop, retain and motivate the best talent. We need that talent to be teaching in our Sometimes in the classrooms, we're really, not really aware about what's going on in the text but we're really going on about the problems that our house had, and that really affects us a lot. Teachers like that really, that are really experienced helped us, and I believe that we really need those teachers here in our classrooms helping us out. I've come to believe that it can't be kind of a few crusaders trying to do this. There has to be a literally an entire community effort. How did it go? It went great. We've seen some amazing turnarounds. So how have you been doing the school year? Do you like coming to school? Eh-hmm. Have you seen it improve over the last six months or how has it changed? Well it's changed because, from the beginning of the year, kids used to get in trouble more than they do now. It's like when we were in the last six months, we were always arguing and fighting. Now, we are all getting along, and treating each other like family. Why is that? Because we have our core values, family leadership, empowerment, and progress, and students are in it. She's changed tremendously. I mean she enjoys coming to school everyday. She enjoys the principal, the staff, students she interacts with them well. I've seen a lot of changes since the new leadership has come in here. The school year's going well. It's had lots of challenges that we've had overcome but we've weathered the storm to a large degree. The climate of the building has changed. The culture of the building has changed. The investment from the community is starting to be more, and more present. I look out to Baseline, and Jonathan Crossley has some of the worst, toughest people in that neighborhood, and they're playing basketball with him. I thought that's why he fought so hard to get the basketball court, making it to show not just other leaders but the community, hey, I'm in here with you guys, I'm in here for the long haul. Our families that live in the area have been very pleased to see the greater parental engagements, and just sort of the change in culture of that school. Well as the saying goes, it takes a village to raise a child. So I think everyone should be involved. Very poor neighborhood, very dense neighborhood. A lot of challenges with violence and crime. I come from communities where dropout rates are extremely high but because of the exceptional help that I get from communal level, I will be attending Brown University in the fall. We make sure that we provide opportunities at whatever level the parents are at, and that we also support them in feeling like they are a partner with us in the education of their children. With our graduation rates being close to 100%, over 80% of our kids are getting into four-year colleges. So we can't do that alone. Okay, this is so important that our Latino parents get involved. Some of the Latino parents don't even know how to speak English, have never gone to school but all they have to do is inspire them. Get informed. Get informed, get engaged, and advocate. It's not enough just to volunteer in the school. You need to learn the system. You need to understand the system, and understand what your choices are. Most importantly, policy change in order to solve the educational crisis is not charters, it is parental choice, parental power. I would put my trust in parents but for anything else. I truly believe education starts at home but when we send out kids into the schools, it's not enough to just want more, we have to demand more. We are making choices for our children. We all want the best for our children. So we need to be very smart about what the next move is, and how we're gonna do as a community. We can't just wait for the politicians to do it for us, we've got the pressure on them. We've got the create the sentiment that lets the politicians know public education is essential for our future, and we want it, we'll insist upon it. We need parents' voice more involved. We need teachers' voice more involved. Most importantly we need students' voice more involved. So let's get back to the students... where this all began. Hi everyone, and welcome to the third New York City Diversity Council. Last year, this was just an idea. This was just something we always just talked about but then we actually made it happen. Right now, currently in this meeting, we have people from across the city. At least 10 districts, from District 2, 3, 7, 10, 8, and even keeps going on. I just want to say that this is a collective effort. This is a community. This is the essence of diversity. We want the city to look like this. We want our schools to look like this. Hopefully, by this movement, it could happen. Without students taking leadership then we wouldn't have a change at all. Despite our flaws and differences, we get together, and with the same things we value, and we work on building a community. As teenagers, we can make our voice be heard, and influence how adults shape our future. When we as students stand up and take leadership, we are the ones ultimately benefiting in the long run. When we allocate resources, and when we diversify schools, the results are ultimately seen in the world that we live in. I think that's what we really want to see. We wanna see change. There needs to be more models like this, and more students need to come together because this directly affects you, and will affect your children, and your grandchildren. I feel this work has been hugely impactful on my students. I think that they're starting to realize that they can't wait for some savior to come, and create diversity, and equity. Human kind kind of poses these questions, and I think they're starting to realize that they were born to answer them. Unity is the only plausible pathway to justice. Youth for integrate. The Little Rock Nine means a lot to me because it shows how much our ancestors cared enough to sacrifice their lives for us, for me to have the opportunity to be able to go to school, be able to have better jobs, and better living. When these are in fact our ancestors, and people whose shoulders we stand on, and they made a way for us to be in the educational system. So I thank them. Education, it gets you there you know, when they took that big step. We need to know what our ancestors did to get us where we are now, and we need to keep pushing, and raising the bar higher. Don't matter what nobody ever tells you. Education is always the key. The sacrifices that I've made when I was 15, 16, 17 years old, were so that you would have more possibilities, more hopes and dreams, and that you would fully engage as a student. So you have to go for it because I've paid it forward for you. Just like in 1957, you're going to have to work twice as hard. Maybe three times as hard but you can still do it. Don't let your conditions dictate, who you're going to be. So it's up to you guys, up to you students to carry on the legacy to show everybody that it can be done. What I'm doing today in the community college is fighting for a change in the school system, and making sure that there is a huge gap between the education system compared to schools at other communities. I want to make sure that my kids could go to school in the community that they live in. So wherever I decide to live, I feel like they can go to school, and receive a quality education, and not feel like they're being deprived of anything. You absolutely deserve to demand what's rightfully yours. All young people should join me in this fight because we all live in the same circle. Anybody can stand up against injustice, and they can succeed because when you are working towards justice, people will join you. Just don't give up, your voice is powerful. It's not too late. There's one concept, it's called tikkun olam . It's a Jewish tradition. It talks about each one of us in the universe is charged with the responsibility of repairing the world. That's a given responsibility. What if, what if everybody believe that? You see, and work hard toward repairing the world. That's what I'm gonna do. I just won't get nobody a reason to doubt me. Nobody a reason to say, Bradley you can't make it or Bradley you can't change the world because I'm just going to change the world. I'm just going to do it. That's it.
