I know you will cherish it. [music box nob cranking] ["Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star"] To my sweet Jack. I never knew what happiness was until you. I loved you since you were only a mere twinkle in your mother's eyes. You've given my life meaning in a way I could have never ever imagined possible. I'm so proud to be your dad. Never a moment passes that I don't think of you. I didn't take advantage of this life the way I should of. I didn't realize this was all we had until it was too late. Life is short. You showed me that. I'm sorry I couldn't change how things worked out. Life throws us curve balls and I didn't know how to adjust. We may not be together but you are in my heart always and forever.

It's complicated, but I don't have any money or any credit cards, and uh, everything in the unit goes to this bullshit auction if I don't take care of it by six today. [loud thudding] - Done. I'm all over it like butter on bread. - Cool. Let me, I'm gonna actually call you back in a second, but thanks. - [Evan] Hang up on a-- - Jack? [somber music] [ringtone tinkling] Good morning. - [Sherry] Good morning to you? You sound happy today. - It's a good day. Sun's out. Soaking in that vitamin D. - [Sherry] Cool. Real quick, do you remember Evelyn, our old neighbor? - I do remember Evelyn our old neighbor, and her husband, Ed, was his name. Why? - [Sherry] Uh, because she just called me at work and said she thinks she might of heard a gunshot come from our old house. - That's weird. - [Sherry] Yeah, it is very weird. I also found it odd when she told me she saw your car over there this morning. - [Kyle] Huh? My car? - [Sherry] Your car. - Uh, that, that is, that, that is odd. I, I don't know. I, I don't put too much steak sauce on old Evelyn Mayberry. - [Sherry] I see. Are you drunk? - No! - [Sherry] Ugh. - Day drinking is stupid and irresponsible. - [Sherry] All right, all right, Kyle. I don't have time for your shenanigans right now. I have to go back to work. I just wanna know why for some reason were you at the house firing guns? - I'm running errands. I don't do shenanigans, okay? [Sherry sighs] I haven't been by the house in a fort's night. - [Sherry] Oh my God. - But, give or take a couple forts. - [Sherry] I find that hard to believe, Kyle. - Yeah. I tell you what. Evelyn Mayberry is a crazy bat lady. And I'll tell ya something else, that old bag of bones husband of hers hip probably shattered, and she thought that was a gun shots. - [Sherry] Are you sure you're not at the house? ["Twinkle Twinkle Little Star"] Kyle? Kyle. - No. - [Sherry] No, you're not at the house, or no, you're not sure? - No. I'm, I'm sure I'm not at the house. - [Sherry] Okay. Then will you go over there to make sure that no one's firing guns? - No. Why? - [Sherry] To make sure everything's okay! Please. For peace of mind. I would go, but you said you were already out, and I'm at work. - I don't think it's necessary to drive four hours across town because a 80-year-old senile grandma is hearing things. Sure everything's all right. [eerie music] ["Twinkle Twinkle Little Star"] - [Sherry] Fine, Kyle. You know what? I'm just gonna stop what I'm doing, my patients can get their teeth cleaned tomorrow, and I'll go over there and check on everything. - No, no, no-no, no, no, no. Don't. You don't need to go over there. I'll, uh-- - [Sherry] Asshole. - I'll go over. You, you keep doing what your doing. Kyle's on the case. - [Sherry] Okay, great. Thank you. - Not a problem. How's your uh, how's your day going? - [Sherry] Let me know about the house. - Making everyone's teeth extra white? - [Sherry] I am hanging up. - I love you. Oh, fuck.

I might, uh, have [loud pounding] a panic attack or something. [dramatic music] - [Officer Cox] Answer the door now, Mr Harden. - Do you hear that? Do you fucking hear that? That shit's bad. [doorbell ringing] When that motherfucker goes around and sees your car in the garage, they're not going anywhere. There'll probably be more fucking cops. Not to mention Evelyn is talking to the super cop about you waving your dick all over the fucking place. You had to fuck up the storage unit. [doorbell ringing] Everything was going so perfectly. Our plan was on point. It was on point. [doorbell ringing] But everything's so fucking difficult with you. Nothing is ever simple. That's why Sherry hates you. That's why Sherry hates you. Sherry hates you. Sherry hates, Sherry hates you. Sherry. - Please answer the door. - [uggh] Get them the fuck out of here now. [loud knocking] I'm fucking coming! Fuck you! Hey. - Uh, Mr. Harden? - Yes. What, what is it? - I'm Officer Cox. This is Officer Strawberry. Are you okay? - You're out here beating on my door and ringing the bell 18 times to ask me if I'm okay? - Well, uh, you're bleeding, pretty badly, sir. - It appears. Is that it? - No, do you mind if we come in? - Whoa, I do mind, I do mind actually. Let's take it down here. What can I do for ya? - We have reason to believe a gun was discharged at your house this morning. - You have reason? - Yes. - Is that a question? - Yes, sir. - Why would you ask it like that? "You have reason." That's a statement. Why don't you just ask it like a normal person? Better yet, tell me what your reason is. - We received an anonymous tip that a gun-- - Strawberry, I got this. We received an anonymous tip that a gun was heard going off over here, at your house, couple of hours ago. [drumming music] - That's right. - Also, we were informed that there was an incident with your realtor. - Incident. I don't uh, I don't remember any incidents. - An altercation or argument didn't transpire here? - You said your name was Cox? - Yes, sir. - Cox, that's a, that's a weird name on you. You, you don't look like a Cox. - There was some, uh, shouting heard coming from your residence about 20 minutes after the gun was heard. The realtor was seen leaving distraught. - An anonymous tip you said? - That's right. - Your tip was mistaken. I don't even own a gun. - Is that a fact? - Yes. - Standing on a broken pot. What's that about? - [Officer Cox] Strawberry, enough. - But I'm, uh, standing on broken terracotta, sir. - He's standing on broken terracotta. - I probably wouldn't stand there if it was, uh, bothering me. - [Officer Cox] Step off the broken pieces. - [chuckles] You two are a interesting, interesting couple, like I would never see you and you in the same place and think, those guys must be partners. But it, uh, it works. Oddly. [drumming music] Well, if that's it, fellas, I'm gonna head back inside. - Do you mind if we have a look around the property? - I don't care what you do as long as you're not beating on my door or ringing my doorbell. Whooo! Talk about a close call. [laughing] You know what I'm saying. Great!

Fucking terrible. [dramatic tense music] I'm on my way. Kyle. Hey hey. [chaotic music] ♪ Ah ah ah ah - Kyle. Kyle. Kyle, hey, hey, hey. Kyle, hello, hello. Hello. Kyle. [railroad crossing bell ringing] Dude, you're drooling. - Huh? - What are you doing? You've been looking at me for like the past three minutes. - What's up, man? - Did you eat a horse tranquilizer or something? [Kyle laughing] Oh my God, dude, where did all your hair go? - Oh yeah. I cut it. - You gotta leave that to professionals, man. You look like shit. Is that blood? - Nah, dude. That ain't blood. - It's all over your face. - Totally, man. Hey, hold on a sec. I can still, I can still hear you. - Okay, so my ETA says I'm about 30 minutes away, but that is impossible considering I am sitting in a parking lot 'cause there's a train carrying empty container wagons. [Kyle coughs] - It doesn't make any sense. I literally haven't moved in like two minutes. I should just put the car in park. - Maybe you should. What did coach used to say? Don't talk about it. - [Both] Be about it. - Yeah. I cannot argue with that. I'm gonna do it. [somber rhythmic music] - [Evan] We're all good, man. I put the car in park. We're all green over here. - Coach would be proud. - Oh great, of course. Yeah, it just moves five feet now. Ah, oh no, it stopped again. Okay, we're fine. [horn honking] Oh, my bad, man. Did you wanna move up a little bit? Is, will five feet get you closer to your destination? Cool. [horns honking] Okay, hey, hey. Okay, motherfucker, stop. Dumb ass. [horn honking] Oh, he honked. I can do that too, I can honk a fucking horn too. You like that? Yeah? 'Cause your mother did, 'cause I was honking her horn all night last night, baby. How's she feeling today, 'cause when I left her, she was crying. Dickhead! Shut up! [laughs] This fucking guy back here is honking because I won't move up five feet. - I heard. I heard. [horn honking] - Okay, okay, ya know, shut the fuck up! Shut the fuck up! I'm gonna handle this guy real quick. Shut up! Shut, shut the fuck up. Oh fuck, holy shit! Holy shit! What the fuck is wrong with you? - Whoa, shit. - I got kids with me! - They're your kids? I'm sorry. That's my, okay take it, take it! I don't want it! Fuck, dude! Fuck! Shit. - Dude, that guy just ate your burrito. - Oh fuck. What am I doing? - [Kyle] Yo, was that your food? [horn honking] - Dude [whimpers]. I can't eat it now. [Kyle chuckles] I don't know if he's sick. I don't know what he has. I just fucking got this thing. It's just a tortilla. It's like I'm sitting in a sea of pollution and idiots, man. - Yeah. It's that moment you realize your life isn't quite as significant as you thought it was. I mean, there's way too many people. [somber music] And, every last one of them thinks what they're doing is more important than the other guy, yet in the grand scheme of it all none of it matters. Look at 9/11. Aside from taking two minutes to read your Facebook posts about it one day out of the year, it's like it never happened, and that was just 15 years ago. And it could be anything. You name it. World wars, tsunamis, earthquakes, starvation. None of it matters to anyone except, and only for a brief moment in time, the people whom are directly affected. But for the rest of us, it'll just be some sad event that future generations'll read about in seventh grade history class where they're more concerned about if their erection's gonna go away before the bell rings than whatever their fat teacher is saying about nine fucking 11 anyway. - [Evan] Boners in seventh grade were the shit. - Boners in seventh grade were the shit. - I remember I used to have to take my backpack and I'd have to swing it around to the front of my pants and hide my boners because they were so big. - You know, it's like you only remember when life was good [gentle music] before the bubble burst and the world revealed itself as the shitbox that it is. - Yeah, see that's your problem though. Okay? You need to get back into the bubble. Ignorance is bliss, man. It's simple. - No, no, no, nah. I know way too much of this morbid fucking existence, man. I can't ignore it. - Why is, why are you so depressing? Why is this conversation depressing? This whole this is, it's depressing me. - I'm just being real. If I died today, it wouldn't matter. - No, it would matter, 'cause then I would have to go find another best friend to go do favors for. Like sit in traffic. - So then what was the point to Kyle Harden? Or my son? Why was he here? Outside of like a fucking photograph it's like he wasn't anything. He's just a memory, you know? And when I die, so does the memories of him. It'll be like he never existed. So what was the point? What was the point to anything? Or anybody? - I get it. Hey, why don't you come out with Stacy and I tonight. Come on. - I got a lot to do. - We're going dancing. - Ya know, we're still trying to sell the house, and-- - [Evan] No, I'm not taking that, man. - [Kyle] Some stuff I have to take care of. - I'll do you one better, buddy. I'm gonna come over after the storage unit and I'm gonna pick you up and drag you out of that house. Come on. - Fine. - [Evan] Yeah? - Yes. - [Evan] Yeah! - But I gotta lot of shit to do, like I said, okay? So let me, um, I'm gonna call you back. - I will be right here. Probably in the same exact spot. - Okay. We'll talk in a bit. Hopefully you get there soon. [exhales] There we go. [phone ringing] Ah ha ha ah, fuck you pee. - [Sherry] Hi, you've reached the Harden residence. Press one for Kyle. - Press two for Sherry. For no one living here. - And press three for baby Jack. - This sure is a busy fucking house. - Jack says press four if you'd like to smell his diaper. - [Kyle And Sherry] Beep! - [Sherry] [laughing] Okay. Stop pressing buttons. This is just a regular answering machine, but, if you leave a message. - [Kyle] And you're trying to reach [Jack jabbering], that's right. - [Sherry] Baby Jack will call you back, and you two can try to decipher what the other is trying to say. - [Kyle] Hey, it'll be fun. - [Sherry] Talk to you soon. - [Marcy] This message is for Mr. Kyle Harden. - Almost time. - If this is not Kyle Harden, please disregard and erase this message now. Mr. Harden, this is Marcy calling from the legal department of J. Brooks. - Hello. - [Marcy] I presume I'm speaking to Kyle Harden? - Yes. What? - [Marcy] Well, Mr. Harden, due to your lack of production over the course of this year, and, well to be perfectly frank, failing repeated drug testing, you will not. - I had a prescription. - You will not be receiving any severance pay. - I can show you the note. - Nor will we be paying you the remainder of your commission as those now belong to the company. - [Jack] Daddy? [eerie music] It wasn't your fault. I remember when you used to sing me that song. [somber music] I miss you. [deep somber music] [gentle guitar music] [cries] ♪ Twinkle, twinkle ♪ Little star ♪ How I wonder ♪ What you are ♪ Up above the world ♪ So high ♪ Like a diamond ♪ In the sky ♪ Twinkle, twinkle ♪ Little star ♪ How I wonder ♪ What you are ♪ How I wonder ♪ Where you are [sad music] [cries] - [Evan] Hey, Kyle. What's up? Don't talk. Hold on for a second. Yeah, yeah, no problem. Okay, I'll let him know. Cool. Have a great rest of your day, Madillio. Actually before you go back, I need to take a massive shit. Can I use your employee bathroom in the back? Please. Thanks, dude. Hey, what's up, man? - Hey. [laughs] - [Evan] Ah, so you're all set here. Everything's fine. Everything's paid up. All your belongings are safe and sound. - All right, good, good, good. It's great. Thank you very much. - [Evan] What are best friends for? - Yeah. You are my best friend. I never said this [throat clear] 'cause it's gay or whatever, but I love you. - [Evan] You're right, that's the gayest thing you've ever said to me. [Kyle chuckles] Yeah, I know, I know. [sad music] - Madillio, I am so sorry, man, that is horrific. Ooph. Good bye, it was nice meeting you. Food truck kimchi. Not good. And I love you too, hard on. Really I'm glad you called me earlier. You know, you, you seem pretty good aside from all that depressing shit you were saying earlier. - What can I say. - But all that jabroni stuff, done. Okay? We're moving on. And I'm gonna come over to your house and I'm gonna cheer you up. And when I do, I'm gonna give you one big ass homoerotic hug. - Sweet. I always loved those. Yeah. I might give you one of my classic nudges with my penis. - Shit, I hope you do. Get up right now. Let's feel it. [Kyle chuckles] Squeeze me. Little harder. [Kyle grunts] Oooo. [Kyle chuckles] You smell nice. - [Kyle] You smell like a bathroom. - Thank you. I sprayed myself with Febreze. - Mmm, that is nice. - Do your thing. And I'll be over in about, about an hour. - Okay. - [Evan] My asshole's on fire. - Good bye. [eerie music] [phone beeps] - [Scott] This is Scott Harden. I am not available to take your call right now. So please leave a message and I'll call you back as soon as I can. [answering machine beeping] - [sniffs] [throat clear] Hey, Dad. It's Kyle, it's Kyle. I'm sorry. I know that I'm too late. Maybe things will be better on the other side. Yeah, yeah. [phone beeps] [phone ringing] - [Sherry] Hi, you've reached the Harden residence. Press one for Kyle. - [Kyle] Press two for Sherry. - [Sherry] And press three for baby Jack. [Jack jabbering] - [Kyle] Jack says press four if you'd like to smell his diaper. [siren blaring] - [Kyle And Sherry] Beep! - [Sherry] [laughing] Okay. Stop pressing buttons. This is just a regular answering machine, but, if you leave a message. - [Kyle] And you're trying to reach [Jack jabbering], that's right. - [Sherry] Baby Jack will call you back, and you two can try to decipher what the other is trying to say. - [Kyle] Hey, it'll be fun. - [Sherry] Talk to you soon. Kyle, Kyle, please pick up. Oh my God. Please, I'm on my way over. Kyle, please don't do-- - [Officer Scott] Go, go, move, move! Go ahead, go ahead. Move out. Go, go, go, go. Go, go, go, go, move, move. [loud thudding] Mr. Harden. This is the L.A.P.D. Open the door. [loud thudding] Mr. Harden? Open the door, Mr. Harden! Or we'll break it down. [loud thudding] Mr. Harden, open the door please. [loud thudding] Knock it down. [ominous music] [door slamming] [tense music] Mr. Harden? [man murmuring ominously] Everything's gonna be okay. - [Officer Cox] Kitchen's clear. - [Officer Strawberry] Family room is clear. - Don't come in. I have a gun. [laughs evilly] - [Officer Scott] We're here to help. - I don't want any help. [tense music] - [Officer Scott] I'm here because people care about you. - Shh. - [Officer Scott] Mr. Harden? - Sherry called you, huh? - [Officer Scott] She only wants what's best for you. [tense music] She's on her way. You can talk to her yourself. Mr. Harden? I need to know that you're okay. - I'm fine. Fucking outstanding. - [Officer Scott] Okay, let me start over, Kyle. May I call you Kyle? - I don't care. - [Officer Scott] My name is Scott. It's very nice to meet you. - Scott, that's my dad's name. - [Officer Scott] It's a good name. It means painted warrior. If that's not badass, I don't know what is. Is your dad a badass? - Yeah. He was. Too badassed sometimes. - [Officer Scott] Huh, tell me about it, I know what you mean. My dad was a real hard ass as well. You know, Kyle, I really hate talking to this door. May I come in alone, and we can keep talking? - No. This is fine. Stay out there. You stay on the other side of this door. I gotta gun pointed at your fucking head. - [Officer Scott] That hurts my feelings, Kyle. - Stop patronizing me! What the fuck? I'm a grown fucking man! [loud thudding] - [Officer Scott] I'm sorry, okay? I just wanna come in and make sure you're okay and that you don't need any medical attention. - I don't need any. - [Officer Scott] You know I wanna believe you, Kyle, but we got reports of gunshots fired at this location, and I really need to see for myself that you're not hurt. Now I'm gonna slowly open the door. Please don't shoot me. - Then don't open the door. - I have to, Kyle. [door clattering] - That's not okay. - [Officer Scott] I'm coming in. My hands are right here. - I just wanna be alone, man. - [Officer Scott] I'm unarmed. It's just me. My hands are up. It's just me, I'm unarmed, okay? Kyle. I'm gonna leave my hands right here. All right? But you gotta do me a favor. Would you mind putting the gun down? Can you just not point it at me at least 'cause I'm not a big fan of having a gun pointed at my head when I'm trying to have a conversation. - I don't wanna have a conversation with you. Just leave. Just get out. Nobody's listening to me today. Nobody's listening to me. - [Officer Scott] I am listening, Kyle. That's what I do. I'm here, I'm listening to you. - No you're not. [chuckles] I asked you to leave, dude. Just get out of my house. - I can't do that, Kyle. - Sure you can. Walk out the door, man. Walk out the front door. - If I were to leave right now, and something were to happen to you, I gotta go home with that. How am I gonna look my son in the eye and tell him I did everything I could to help you, huh? I'm here, Kyle. Look at me, Kyle. Look at me. I'm here. I care about what happens to you. A lot of people care. What you do here has a lasting affect on a lot of people. Okay? [gentle music] So just put the gun down. You don't want your son to see you like this. - You don't talk about my son. [gun firing] You don't talk about my son! - Put the gun down! - Put your gun down! - Easy! Whoa, whoa! Whoa, whoa, easy. He doesn't want me in the room, okay? Just stand down. Back up. We're cool. We're cool, right, Kyle? I'm backing up. I'm backing up. - I got a clear shot. - [laughs] What? What are you gonna do? Shoot me? You gonna fucking shoot me? Shoot me. Please. 'Cause I'm having a real fucking hard time doing it! - Easy, Kyle. Stand down! - I'm done talking to you. - Kyle take the gun away from your head. I'm done talking. - Take the gun down! - Get the fuck out of my house!
