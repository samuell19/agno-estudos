Aussie Jit! Aussie Jit! Aussie Jit! Aussie Jit! Aussie Jit! Aussie Jit! Aussie Jit! - Dear God, help me. Aussie Jit! Aussie Jit! Aussie Jit! Aussie Jit! Aussie Jit! - So, Aussie. Are you a Muslim? - No. Why do you ask? - That thing on your head, I think I've seen on TV before. - This thing is called a dastar or a turban, and you shouldn't believe everything you watch on TV. - I was just curious. So, what God do you believe in? - Isn't there only one God? - You call him God, we say Waheguru. - Wahe what? - Wahe what? - Shh. - Hey, Osama! Hey, why don't you go back to where you come from? - Rajveer! - Wake up, sleepyhead. - Are you leaving now? - Yeah. Okay. This is my friend's address in Perth, just in case, okay? - How long will you have to drive for? - I think around 15 hours. Now, come on. - Rajveer! - So, Aussie, is your brother gonna be in the army or the air force? - Army. He's gonna go into a Humvee and blast all those terrorists. - Oh, that is so awesome. - My uncle was in the army. He was killed in Iraq. - Rajveer will be in a Humvee, he'll be fine. - My uncle Howie was in a tank, and it blew up. He was the coolest uncle. - Rajveer will be fine! - Hey. - Two coalition soldiers were killed when an improvised explosive device ripped through their Humvee. This brings the tally to 4,150 coalition soldiers killed so far in the fight against terror. - Pa. Can we get Rajveer back? I don't want him to be in the army anymore. Besides... He dropped his phone. He'll be looking for it. Pa! I don't want Rajveer to be in the army anymore! Look. We'll take these shortcuts, can get to Perth a lot faster that way. Please. I don't want Rajveer to die. - Okay, son. - Why do we have to do this? This is so stupid! - What was that? - Pa, wake up. Pa, wake up. Pa? Pa? Pa, wake up. Wake up. Pa, wake up! Help, help. He's not waking up, help me. - Sorry, my son. There's nothing we can do. - What do you mean? - There's nothing we can do. - Pa? Pa? - Come, boy. Come, boy. - No, what are you doing? - To keep away the bad spirits. You know we gotta tell them white fellas, aye? - What about the body? Could be days before the police get here. - Days? No! We can't keep Pa like this for days. And Rajveer has to do the Antim Ardas. - Who? - Rajveer, my older brother. He's the oldest son, so it's his responsibility. - Where is your brother? - He's in Perth now, and he's joining the army. I have to get to him before it's all too late. - Who will take that boy to Perth? - Why should we do that? He's not our problem! - That's him there, standing. He's the one that will take him there. Hey, boy. This is Tjidrm. He'll take you to Perth to find your brother. - Drink. Drink. - Yuck. That's disgusting! Get used to it. Chew on this and rub some onto your wound, it'll make the pain go away. But don't eat too much of it. - Why? - It'll give you dreams, and make you see stuff. - It is a drug? - No, it's not a drug. - Thanks? - It's not like I have a choice. That cut will slow us down if you don't attend to it. - Why are you so angry? I didn't ask for any of this to happen! Anyways, I'm sorry to trouble you. - Yeah, that's what the white fella said too. "Sorry." And then he sheds some tears and expects everything to be okay. You were lucky we found your first. - What do you mean? - Didn't you hear the elders talk about it last night? - If the white fellas find you, they'll put you in the missing school, turn you into a Christian, and change your name. Don't worry, I told you you were lucky we found you first, didn't I? Just keep your head down when you get to the city. Don't trust anyone, otherwise they will take you away. Do you understand? Don't trust anyone. - What were you doing out here? I didn't know that Aboriginals still live in the bush. - "I didn't know Aboriginals still live in the bush". You don't know anything about us. We're on a sacred journey. We've been walking a couple of days before we found you. The uncles believe the walk might help us. - Help you? How? - We have a lot of problems, it is difficult to explain. - Try me. - Some uncles believe it is because we have lost our soul when the white fella took our land. They say the land is our blood, so when we lose our land, it kills our culture. People are dropping like flies. You didn't hear all this on the news. - Maybe you should do something about it. - What can I do? - I don't know! You should know your people better. What did you do that for? - It's for dinner. - In case you're wondering, I'm a vegetarian! - That's funny. What was that? It's a farm! Let's get down there, they may have some water. - No. - Why not? You mean you had this all along? Why did you make me drink from the mud yesterday? - This is for emergency only, when we cannot find mud. Take it easy, we gotta make it last. Why can't we get down there? We can get to Perth sooner that way. - What's your hurries anyway? - I have to get to Rajveer before the 11 days are up for the last prayer. - What last prayer? - For my dad. - Well, come on then! Quick, put some dry leaves on it! - Why didn't you just use the lighter instead? - The uncles send us on this journey for a reason. Otherwise, we could've just taken the bus. They said to show you our way. - But why? It's not like I'm gonna be living here. - All I know is, you are my responsibility now. - I told you, I don't eat meat. - You must eat something. - Just give me more of those leaves you gave me yesterday. My shin hurts. You remind me of my brother. He's always angry, just like you. Everyone thinks that I don't know what happened that day. I remember Mom was very happy. We went for some ice cream... When a man came in, and started shooting. - Wait. Both of your parents are dead too? I'm sorry. - Rajveer blames the Muslims. But my father says, "Anger clouds your vision." I mean, he used to. Could you help me tie my turban please? Thank you. Come on. - My journey ends here, you must go on your own now. - No! Come with me! - You'll be fine. Besides, I'm not familiar with the city, so I'm no use to you. Just keep to yourself. - Whoa! Don't be afraid. It's okay, I'm not going to hurt you. Are you lost? Thought so. Maybe I can help. Do you know where you need to go? I know this place! You need to continue down the street, take the second left, then you come to a church, and then you... You know what? It's really complicated. I'll take you there, come on. - Can I have my note back, please? - Oh, you mean this? Don't worry, mate. You can trust me. - Yeah, but can I have my note back? - What? Don't you trust me? Listen. You're new to the city, aren't you? If you want to make it in this city, you're going to need a friend, like me. Come on. - Hey, wait! Hey, wait. - Come on, this way. - Wait, where's the note? - Come on! - I need it back. - Shh. If you make a sound, you are dead. Got it? Give me the bag! What's in that? - Nothing. - Give it here. - I said it's nothing, let it go! - Give it! - Hey, what are you doing? - You are lucky, kid. - Honey, are you okay? - Well, you're welcome. Boys. - Get up, get up, get out, I said get out! Bev, get up! - Hi. - What did I say about bringing boys back? - Well, but he's not a boy, he's a pilot. - Well, it's a bush pilot, actually. - You hear that? He's a bush pilot. - Get out! - Cheers. - You're gonna report to Camp Pierce in Laverton in two days. - How far away is it? - About a thousand kilometers east of Perth, 12 hours by road. I'll see if there's any transport going in the next 48 hours. - You know, it tastes better with the meat in it. Isn't why they call it a kebab, 'cause kebab means meat? Hey, wait! Hey! That's my turf! Don't come back! - Good morning. Go on. I made it for you. Take it easy, cowboy, it's still hot. Don't you like bacon? - I'm a vegetarian. - Well, what about the eggs then? - Egg isn't meat. - I didn't think of it like that. Where are you going? - I have to get my stuff. - Well, I'll come with you then. - No! Just tell me where you found me. It was just down the street, you can't miss it. - Whoa, what is this? Are you taking in homeless kids now? I thought you said no boys were allowed? - Very funny. - Who said I was joking? - What's wrong with you, he's just a child. - Why is he here? - What was I supposed to do? He was passed out in the street. - Well, you could've called the cops, or an ambulance. He's not Andrew. - I know he's not Andrew. Look what you've done now! - You should know to mind your own business. - Let me go! - Shut up! Stop moving. - Hey! Leave her alone! - What's this, Bollywood? Do you think you could save her? Get lost, kid! - I said leave her alone! - He's just a kid! - Where's the note? Come on. And FYI, I'm not Bollywood, I'm Punjabi! - Let me help you. Please. - Are you going to call the police? - What? No. You gonna tell us what's going on? - Who's that in the picture? - That's Andrew. My kid brother. He was about your age when he ran away from home. - Are you still looking for him? - Yeah. - Can you help me find my brother too? - Is that who you have to get to? And he lives here? Why didn't you say so sooner? Let's go. - Get your shoes. - Where is Rajveer? - He's not here, he just left 10 minutes ago. - What? No! He's not supposed to leave until tomorrow. Yeah, but they arranged to fly him out today. - Do you know where? You might be able to find out if you hurry to the office. - Ajit, wait! - Wait. What's wrong? - I can't go in. Why not? - If they find out that I'm an orphan, they'll send me away. - Don't be silly, they can't do that. Can they? - You don't understand. And I can't take any chances. Look... Just go in and tell them that you're his girlfriend or something like that. - Excuse me? - Please. You have to help me find my brother. - I'll do it. - No. It's okay. I can do this. Are you sure? - Yeah. All right. You see that bench over there? Go wait with Bev while I go in, okay? - Okay. - Who's in charge here? - Now, how can I be of service? - I'm looking for my fiance. Are you now? - Yeah. Funny story, you see, he and I had a small argument, and next thing you know, he signed up for the army. Can you believe that? So, if you don't mind, I need to see him now. - And your fiance, does he have a name? - Yes, Raj Singh. - Singh. That sly fox. - Patterson. Yeah? - Sir, I have a lady here that says she's Singh's fiance, and she wants him back. - Is this a joke? - No sir, I have her right here in front of me. - Hang on. Singh! - Yes, sir? - It's recruitment on the line, they say your fiance's here, and she wants you back. - But sir, I don't have a fiance. - Are you sure? - Yeah, really sure, sir. I don't have a fiance, no. - Okay. Davis, I just spoke to Singh. That's a negative. Must be one of those stalker types. Thank you, sir. - Yeah. - I'm sorry, Miss. Singh is denying that he knows you. - Oh, he's probably just upset. Could you call him again? - I'm sorry, Miss. I'm afraid I can't help you. I'm gonna have to ask you to leave. - Okay, okay, look. I'll be honest. It's his brother. - Huh? His brother is your fiance? - No! His brother wants to speak to him. Can you just call again and let him know he wants to speak to him? - Hello, yeah. I need security right away. - You're lucky they're a good pair. I'm so sorry. They wouldn't let me speak with him. Don't worry, it's okay, Ajit, we'll think of something. A thousand kilometers. - How long will that take? - Maybe a day or two. - Will you please take me there? - I've got a cousin who's got a car, we should be able to borrow it. - When can we leave? - Monday. - Monday? That's three days from now. - That's okay. You can stay here until then. - You don't understand, I need to get to Rajveer before that. It's been eight days, I have to get to him before Sunday. - What are you talking about? - My father, he died eight days ago. - Is that whom you've been carrying around? - Yes. And Rajveer needs to do the Antim Ardas. - The what? - Antim Ardas. It's the last prayer when someone dies. Rajveer is the oldest son, so it's his responsibility to carry out the last prayer before the 11 days are up. Please help me get to Rajveer. - Okay, so let me get this straight. You need to find Rajveer before the 11 days are up, so he can perform the last prayer for your father? We can call Jack. - Who? - The guy you brought back, didn't you say he was a pilot? - The guy you threw out the house, you mean? - Come on, Bev. This is important. Hey, wait. I've gotta go get something, give me your backpack. Come on. - Wait here, okay? - Jack's going to take you to Laberton Air Strip, it's right next to Camp Pierce. Here. Got you this, it's cold. - Thank you. - You all right? I hope you don't mind, but, I took the liberty of putting your father's ashes into this. There's some snacks and some bottled water in there as well. In case you get hungry, okay? - Thank you. I also got you something. - What's this? - A rakhi. - A what? - A rakhi In India, it's the brother's duty to protect his sister. So on rakhi day, all sisters tie a rakhi into their brother's hands for protecting them. - So, you want me to tie this on your hand? - No. You have protected me. Thank you, sister. - You go, now. - So, what's your business in Laverton? - I'm meeting my brother. - Welcome to Camp Pierce. I am Sergeant Montgomery, and you lucky people are now the property of the Australian government. For the next 12 weeks, I will be your mom and dad. The difference between your parents and me, is that I don't love you Now, listen carefully, I'm gonna call out your name, and you will respond with Sergeant, yes, Sergeant. Is that understood? Sergeant, yes, Sergeant. - Bollocks, I can't hear you! Sergeant, yes, Sergeant! - That's better. - Hey man - My name's Peter. - Rajveer. - This pretty boy's Jimmy. - What's up, man? - Nice to meet you, man. - Nice to meet you. - Rajveer. - Are you from India? - Australian, if that's what you're trying to find out. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Take it easy, tiger, I'm just asking. You're Sikh, aren't you? Yeah. - Told you he wasn't Osama. I'm joking, I'm joking, I'm joking. My grandpa was in World War II, he fought alongside many Sikhs. Mad respect, mad respect. - So, where's your haircut, huh? - I just said he's a Sikh. They're exempt from getting haircuts. - Oh. - Pretty boy's an idiot. - Sup. - Hey, Sher. - Jimmy. - Nice to meet you. - Another Indian, how's it going? - Sher. No, I'm from Pakistan. - Aw, all good man, all good. Sher. - Boys. - Hi, Rajveer. - Bec. - Nice to meet you. - Uh oh. - What do you mean "uh oh"? - Yeah, we're gonna have to land here. You might want to hold onto something, kid. - No, no, no, no, those are the controllers. You're making it worse! - Speed up! You guys need concentration, concentration! Hit the ramp, hit the ramp, move your feet! Move, move! - Damn it, son of a... Not again.... Son of a! - What happened? - I'm not sure. I think it might be the oil pressure. Damn it! What happened? - It's the oil pressure. Laverton, this is Delta-199, do you copy? Laverton, this is Delta-199, do you copy, over? This is Laverton. Go ahead, Delta-199. - Yeah, Laverton, we've had a small problem. I lost oil pressure and I've had to make a forced landing. Not again, Jack. How many times have I told you to get off the damn booze. You okay? - Yeah, I'm all right, but I'm gonna need some help fixing it. Yeah, roger that. What's your exact location? - Yeah, I'm about 120K southwest of Laverton. Oh, for God's sake, Jack. Can you give us your exact coordinates? - Hold on! Yeah, Laverton? Yeah, go ahead. - Yeah, my latitude is 22 degrees, eight minutes and four seconds. My longitude is 122 degrees, seven minutes and three seconds. Do you copy? Roger that, Delta-199. Stay near the radio until you hear back from us. - Yeah, roger that, Laverton, I'll stand by the plane. Damn it, Jack, why don't you lay off the boozy." - What do we do now? - We wait here for help. - How long will that take? - I don't know. Could be a day, could be three, never really can tell. - Three days? I can't wait three days, you have to get me there now. - Yeah, sure, why don't you jump on my back and I'll take you there myself. - Hey, what are you... Get off, get off! What is the matter with you? I was kidding with you! Do I look like a camel? - Can't we just walk there instead? - Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh yeah, sure, we can walk there. Except, it's 120 kilometers that way. You're gonna be dead before you reach halfway. We stay with the plane. Hey, where do you think you're going? - Let me go! - Knock it off! - Let me go! - Stop it, stop it. Look, kid, this is a deadly place. The safest thing for us to do is to stay here with the plane and wait for help. - You don't understand. I need to get to my brother now. - You know, I'm not gonna say it again. We stay here and wait for help. You understand? I'll make a camp. You sure you don't want any? - No! Just let me go! Please. - Look, kid. I'm really sorry your dad died, I really am. But what good is it if you go and run off and get yourself killed, hm? What's your hurry anyway? - How many times do I have to tell you? I have to get to Rajveer. - Yeah, we will. You just gotta be patient. - You don't understand! I have to get to Rajveer for the last prayer for Pa. It's been nine days! I only have two days left. - So you believe in all that? Huh? These prayers, and karma, and the afterlife, and God. - It doesn't matter what I believe. My Pa did, and it's important to Rajveer. - So, you don't even believe in it at all? - It's none of your business! And how should I know? I'm only 12! - You're only 12, huh? You know, don't you think it's funny that they can always tell you to pray during times of a tragedy, like it's gonna magically help? I used to pray once. When I was stupid. - Why are you telling me all this? - Because I think you're old enough to know better. So you remember this, 'cause you look like a smart kid. Two hands working can do a million times more than a thousand a prayer. - Whoa! - First round's on me, boys. Cheers. - Cheers. - I have never had a beer before. - Oh, do you want whisky, mate? - No. I mean, I have never had any alcohol before. - Oh, more for me then. - No. I've always wondered what it tastes like. - There's only one way to find out, man, come on. Cheers. - Yuck. Tastes like piss. - Exactly, mate. - What's up. - Hey, hey. - Hey guys. - Sher, come grab a seat. - Thanks. Maybe I'll just join my friends. - That's disgusting. - Give us a kiss darling, come on. She's a little beauty, ain't she, mate? Come on, darling. Come home with us. - Hey! - Whoa, I didn't know we had Taliban in Australia. - You know what? That's getting old. You should let the lady go. - Yeah? You gonna stop me? - If it comes to that. - You and what army? - The Australian army, mate. - Whoa, hey, hey, hey. We don't want no trouble, we just had a few drinks, we don't want no trouble. We're going, we're going. - Then why don't you go back where you come from. - Go back to where you come from? Really? - Yeah, I always wanted to say that. - Come on, come on. - Go, go, go, go, go, go, go! - Go, go, go, go, go, go, go! - Singh. Why don't you like me? - Back off. - See what I mean? What have I done to you? - I said back off! - Oh yeah? And what are you gonna do if I don't, huh? Hey, I'm talking to you. - I said back off! - Where's your turban? - What? Where's your turban? - Don't touch my turban with your dirty hands. You Pakis, one minute you're nice, next minute you cut our throats. - Five fingers from the same hand are not the same. I was nine when men claiming to be guardians of Islam came to my village, took my father and uncles away. They didn't even spare my grandfather. We never heard from them again. Mom and I, we left soon after. Jihad this, jihad that. Fatwa on this, fatwa on that. Anyone that speaks up is labeled a traitor. That's why people just shut up and put up with it. - I'm sorry for judging you. - You know, it is our silence that lends courage to evil. - I became those I hated most. ♪ The battle-drum beats in the sky of the mind ♪ ♪ Aim is taken, and the wound is inflicted ♪ ♪ The spiritual warriors enter the field of battle ♪ ♪ Now is the time to fight ♪ ♪ The battle-drum beats in the sky of the mind ♪ ♪ Aim is taken, and the wound is inflicted ♪ ♪ The spiritual warriors enter the field of battle ♪ ♪ Now is the time to fight ♪ - Get up, son.
