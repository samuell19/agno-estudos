Thanks for tuning in. - Many times at services, I hear a lot of the same words in regard to the deceased. In regard to the person we're here to celebrate today, those words are kind, loving, compassionate, considerate, and many more. A lot of times after the service these same people that so openly praise this individual come to me feeling sad, or sometimes even guilty that they themselves have not lived their life to the standard they have set for this individual. Well, it's nothing to be ashamed of. It simply means that we are not Catherine Coyle. Take the time each and every day to remember this person, remember the type of person that they were, and build the type of person that you want to be. It's never too late. - Jonny, if there's anything you need, just give me a call, anytime, right son? She would have wanted just this. Thank-you. - God bless you son. - Agh, thank God. Thank God.

You were always my favorite mom. - You were my favorite too. - Thanks. - What about you? - Well, I'm clean and sober. - Hmm hmm. - I mean, pretty much. I mean, last night was nothing. And the night before, that was bad. But you know, I puked it up so fast I don't think it counts. - Well, it shouldn't. - And I cut this record. I put everything I had into it. Oh yeah, my mother died, last week. - Oh Jonny. - And my brother, Redd, he, now he thinks I came back here to start a war. Oh yeah, and I'm homeless. - But you're gonna be alright. - Yeah. I'll be alright. - Jonny, Jonny, Jonny. Why didn't you tell me about her? - What, did you want me to leave it on your voicemail? - Yeah, why not. - What do you care, huh? You didn't give a shit about her. - Don't be stupid. Just because, when I went to live with dad, there was no way I could be hanging out with her. I mean even on his deathbed he was calling her the tree-hugging cunt that brainwashed us away from him. - You know he was a misogynist, he was an average songwriter, he was an alcoholic. Ah, I mean, he named us after his favorite drink. At least mom had the common decency of spelling our names different. - Look, just because I wasn't in contact with her, doesn't mean I didn't love her. I mean, you didn't see dad all that much and you showed up at his wake. - Half for the macaroni and cheese. - Sable told me you were alone with her when she died. I'm sorry about that. - I saved you some ashes. - What? - Well, I just thought you might wanna strew them or something. There in my bag in the car. - Word is you're pedaling some music. - Yeah, word is right. - Word is it's bad. - Yeah, word don't know shit from shinola. - Look, calm down alright. Just trying to be supportive. - Calm down, dude, I just fucked your girlfriend in the shower. You should be kicking my ass right now huh. Bro, where is your pride huh? - Hmm. - Come on. - Long gone, I'm afraid. You know, never for once did I ever thing that Sable loved me. She loves you. And that's okay. She and I are friends and that's the way it should be.

Hmm hmm, yeah, you too. - Jonny, this is gonna keep happening. No one in the industry's gonna want anything to do with that demo. For one simple reason. It's fucking terrible. - I'm gonna pretend you did not say that. Oh, oh hold up. Lay it on me baby. Oh, oh, okay, one man's trash is another man's, yeah.

If I'm such a loser. - Because, for some strange reason, I hate the thought of you going around town making a fool of yourself. - You know what's really strange. Is that you're in love with me. - Get back, get away. - No, no it's weird. - This is professional. - Okay, okay, okay, fine.

I have a career, a reputation. You just got out of prison. - Jail. How did you hear about that? - My dad saw you on TV. - Oh. - He's not pleased. - Well, tell him it was for unpaid parking tickets which I paid already. - Kims he said it was cocaine. - Kgh, right, coke. I don't do coke, anymore but, look, it was my mother. It was her ashes. - I, I didn't know. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Well, what about the underage girl? What's your explanation for that? - Fake news. - Huh, yeah. - Yeah. Oh, thank-you, oh yeah really, well, I know for a fact Rock is not dead. Yeah, okay, thank-you. - So?

It's kinda funny. - Hmm, that guy Sykes went to SMU. You know, they just came to me with a lot of money. They wanted to be in the music business and, I can't blame them for being pissed. I took a lot of money from them, and didn't show a nickel in return. I need help, Jonny. - With money. I may not be the guy. - People like you. They just do, it's a gift. Me, I'm the opposite. I always do the right thing but people find me-- - Insufferable? - Off-putting. But there's this kid. I think he's really good. In fact, he kinda sounds a little like you. Sable thinks we can manage him, you and I together. We'll build him up, right here from Red Horse. He can make us a ton of money. - He's awesome. - Really good. - Glad you think so. I thought you'd be a little competitive. - Where'd you find him? - Sable picked him up hitchhiking. - He doesn't have a record deal yet? I find that unfathomable. - Unfathomable. - Right, I know!

Sable, oh come on put some clothes on. - Why? - Tsh, why? Because I don't love you anymore. Not in that way. - You used to. - I used to do a lot of things, Sable. I mean, I'll always love you. But I've changed. Well, I'd like to think I've changed. Actually, I haven't changed at all. But I have to. - Ah ha, agh, ah ah ah - Please God, deliver me from myself. Aah, aah, aah, aah, mm mm mm mm mm mm - Aah, aah. - Mm mm. Let this be the bottom. Ah ah. - Alan Reed told me the story. About when you were a little a kid and I think it was like your little league world series or something. And erm, your parents, Catherine and Walker came to the game but they, they sat on opposite sides of the bleachers and I know that upset you. It's the bottom of the ninth, two outs, and you're up to bat. A lot of pressure. Everybody's cheering Jonny Jonny, Jonny. The first pitch comes, you hit it really far, but it was a foul. Second pitch comes, you hit it even further, foul. I could just see your sweet little face. If you won the game, your family would stay together. I can't even imagine. Third pitch, the ball comes straight down the middle. You swing with everything you have. Strikeout. Game over. I mean I guess it was the end for a lot of stuff that day. - What's your point? - You tell me. - Nice shirt. - Boys are back. - For you. - That's not-- - I know. I miss her. - A baggy? - It's a Ziploc. - You think this is funny? Put on a fucking shirt, man. - I mean, you don't cause riots, or land in jail, or rehab, or in bed with your girlfriend. I mean, tell me what to do. - Every rotten thing that's every happened to you has started with a lie. So stop lying. Start telling the truth. - About what? - About everything. About what keeps you from blowing your brains out. Hollywood fucked you up bro. I mean, what is it, is it, is it the drugs, the drinking, the sex, the cheating, is it the music? You wanna be rich and famous, I mean what the fuck is it? - You know that stuff makes me want to die. - Good start. What doesn't? What makes you want to live? - It's Jonny Coyle. - It's Drusilla. - And Toni. - Hey ladies, where're you up, what's up? - You're nailed to the cross JC. You're in Alaska. - What does that mean? - It means you're cold, Jonny. - They think you started that riot the other night as a publicity stunt. - Did you know that 10 kids ended up in the hospital? You could just wait for the lawsuits. And there's some rumor about you and a sex tape. Like some ugly threesome with bondage and a pussycat. Luckily we like a challenge. So by this time next week you'll be in Florida. - Wait, Florida? Alaska, vomit and a pussycat. No, no no no no. You know, I'm quitting music forever, okay. I'm just done. - Please tell me you're in a tunnel JC? - No, I'm not. But I'm, there's a light at the end of it. - Are you sure it isn't an oncoming train? - You know what? Nacho Rancho is closed on Tuesday. - Hello? Jonny? Jonny, there's no liability in rock and roll. Come on! Seriously, the boss that seeked you saw you here that night, they threw food all over themselves. Jonny? Hello? Hello? Jonny? Hello? - Hello? - Hello? Agh. - Oh my God. - Hey. - Hey. - What's wrong? - It's, it's my dad. I've been, I just, I've been begging him not to put me back where I started. Leave me in classical. And usually every decision he makes is about money but I guess he saw us last night and he's upset and-- - What, I mean what are you talking about? - As a punishment, he put me back in charge of the rock division. - You know, this is so ironic. - What do you mean? - What do I mean, I mean, I quit the music business, I mean if there is a music business. - When though? - Like 15, 20 minutes ago. - Why? - Because I just don't fit into this digital world. I mean, I'm analog. I'm like reel to reel. Tape. I mean music in the cloud. You know what, I am so over it. - Well, what are you gonna do instead? - I'm gonna enjoy these clouds. And, gah, and this. And you know what, and this. Look, just admit it, you're crazy about me. - I am not. - Yes. - You're crazy. - No, no no, look look hey hey hey okay, okay, okay. - Hey, I wanna give you something. - Hmm, what me? - Hmm hmm. - Oh my gosh. Okay, I will-- - Hmm, your head's kinda big. - Oh, I really do love it. - I'm proud of you. You're doing the right thing. - I'm proud of you. Stop - Oh God. - Hey, hey man. This is a perfectly good CD. Are you littering? - What? - Jonny, Jonny Coyle? Rattle Snakes? It's me, Hoss, from Baton Rouge. Varsity, 1988. I was supposed to play with the Aneurysms but my drummer was up in rehab. We came out with that er, that girl Ginger, the red head with the puffy lips and the hash. - Right. - Oh, hello. - Hi. Jessica. - Hoss. - How you doing? This guy sucked them in. - Yeah. - You better watch out, I've seen him get a girlfriend who just liked running his fingers through his hair. Hey Hoss. - So-- - Hey man. - So, you playing tonight, you in town, what's going on? - I can't believe it. - What? - The bath is starting to bubble. - What the fuck does that mean? - You're in love. - Oh God. - About damn time. Have you told him yet. - No, should I? - Hmm, you have your first meeting as a head of rock. - Oh yes, that's true. - Hmm, here. - What is this? - It's a gift from your father. - Woo, what the fuck is his problem? I don't want this thing - Simms. - I saw you and Jonny Spoil in the newspaper. - Oh yeah. - Are you gonna sign him or what? - Guess you haven't heard? - Heard what? - He quit the music business. - Jeesh, what's my return gonna be on that. - Are you okay? - Fuck, no. Fucking Austin allergy bullshit. This guy's gonna die of lead poisoning. Can I use your restroom? - Right this way. - Yo, you should have seen the look on her face. They were mortified. They say he's gonna quit. He's not signing shit. I should have been a fucking actor and pulled this whole phony Austin allergy bullshit routine on them. Ah, maybe. I'll deal with it. Alright. - Good news rocker, rock and roll is back together. - Do I know you? - Tuh, know me. I'm your knight in shining armor, I'm your guardian angel, I'm your wheel of fortune. - Ice, shit. - Oh, damn. Look, see what it is? I mean for Christ sakes, it's like a man can't even reach into his pocket nowadays without some pussy practically pissing himself. Here you go man. - What's this? - It's five thousand dollars, your royalties. - Five Gs. It's the first thousand copies of Anonymous, the sidewalk addition. - Those street guys, Mustang, Rhode Island. - Texas Bitch. - That's right. We stole your shit, we sold it on the streets. I'm Jax, this is my partner Rock Jones, and er, er, you are? - That's my brother, Redd Coyle. - Pleasure. Fucking Mopars. What are you, a penguin. Jesus Christ. Fucking dying. - Oh, pick up man. - Where's our money sat off your ass. - Oh Jesus. Here we go. - It's nothing business, it's just personal. Why'd you quit the business? - I didn't. Well, I did but I didn't. I'm back alright. So you guys please just knock off this cowboy gangster aggie bullshit alright. In fact, here's our first installment alright. - You know, there's plenty more where that came from. - What, are you bouncing rain checks? - Tu, seriously. - You need some help cleaning up around here? - Do you have a broom? - Sure. - What are you gonna sweep up the names you've never dropped? - Stop right there. Stop, back away. - Who's this crazy bitch? - Hey you better watch your mouth Rhode Island. That's my soulmate. - My bad. - What're you doing? - You might wanna cock that, honey. - Wait a second, ain't you the one from the Chronical, hanging onto Jonny Coyle like a God damn possum? - Why are you talking right now? - Honey, put the gun down. - This fucking sweaty ass piece of shit said he was going to kill you. - It was just a little mental espionage. - These guys went to business school, Miss. Banks. They're my business partners. They've just obviously seen too many fucking movies. - Honey, you gotta put the gun, you're freaking me out. - Oh God, I'm freaking out. - I'm freaking out! - Yeah, you're freaking me out. - I'm freaking out. - Put it down, put it down. - I'm freaking out. - Put it down, put it down. - I'm freaking out. - Guess what, you know what's important, it's like you cared. - I do. - You did. - I just had to get your-- - I just, I know. - Just because I-- - Because I love you. - Because I love you. - I love you. - I love you. - I love you, I do, so much. - I do, I love you. - I love, I love love love you. - I love you. - I love you. - Ah, happy ending. You don't see that too much these days. - Whoops! - I loved you from the moment I saw you. I really did. It was just too soon to tell you all the things that I wanted to tell you. And if I got a new chance I would've just told you. I would have told you. I would drive over, you're not scared of anything. And, I would tell you, that I'm not scared of you anymore, I'm not scared of us. And now I'm terrified that it's too late, and I'll, I'll never forgive myself. And I know I'm gonna be alone for a really long time. - Man, I hope he makes it. But if he doesn't, he's really gonna blow up. I can see it now on a billboard. Who shot JC? It's kinda got a ring to it, don't it? - Yeah, it does.
