[ROMANTIC MUSIC] [INDISTINCT] Will you marry me? Yes, yes, I'll marry you. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my goodness! Oh, my God! ["FOLLOW YOUR HEART" PLAYING] Oh, my God! [LAUGHTER] Congratulations! Look at you! You guys, you guys, pose, pose, pose, pose. [LAUGHTER] Oh, my God! Do you need me to feed you? - No, babe. - [LAUGHTER] [PHONE VIBRATING, CHIMES] Man, you guys! Since I posted it, my notifications have just been blowing up. I can imagine. I have so many notifications, but I just want to finish this food so can I have... -Just chill -[PHONE CHIMES] Oh, Toyosi just responded. - Ah, yeah! - What's she saying? Look. [CHUCKLES] - She's so excited. - Aw. [CHUCKLES] I miss her so much. I haven't seen her in such a long time. Yeah. Yeah, even Emeka, all of them. What do you guys think, a reunion, six of us, like old times? Yeah, like, a reunion getaway, without any interruption. Brilliant. Brilliant. Trust me, it's going to be fun. That would totally be our pre-wedding getaway. What do you think? - I mean, except it'll be the six of us. - Six of us. {an8}How did it go? {an8}How did what go? {an8}How did what go? Your friend's proposal, of course! {an8}Oh, erm, I didn't make it. I was caught in traffic. {an8}Considering the fact that we covered up for you, don't you think you owe us lunch? {an8}Mm-hm. And you are buying. {an8}- Mm-hm. - Guys, come on. {an8}[IN YORUBA] Guys how? {an8}Hm! {an8}Uh-uh. Do we look like guys? {an8}Ladies. {an8}Whatever. All right? I have work to do. {an8}Ah, ah, ah. And we look like we are playing now? [{an8}in pidgin] Don't we do the same work in this office? {an8}[IN PIDGIN] Pay him no attention. {an8}He wants to collect Employee of the Month again, {an8}after collecting it ten months in a row. The way you are going, I wouldn't be surprised if The Guinness Book of Records comes and give you an award. [HAILING IN YORUBA] - Employee of the month! - [LAUGHS] But seriously, guys, I can't do lunch. - Mm. - [SCOFFS] [INDISTINCT] - Are you serious? - Eh? Has it changed? What's your business? - Tell us, has it changed? - None of your business. - Eh. - [PHONE CHIMES] OK. - What is the problem? - Is she there? Who is Nife? - [LAUGHS] - Let us change her. Zainab, Zainab. Eh? Who is Nife? - Sorry. - OK, let's give him some... {an8}- [PHONE CHIMES] - ...privacy. {an8}Wants privacy, does he? Not to talk of privacy. [CHUCKLES] What's up? What's wrong? There's this reunion that I and my friends from university are having at Whispering Palms... Whispering Palms! Oh, that... That's the place I told you now - that I have my family reunion. - Oh, yeah! Wow! So, what happened? Why you sad? What's the problem? - What's wrong? - Toyosi is coming. Who be that? - Toyosi is my ex. - Oh. That's your ex? The one that dumped your, er, sorry ass for the coolest guy on campus. Oh! - So, she's coming. What happen? - It's been six years. Dude, it's six years, not six days. I mean, things have changed. Why you so stuck? You need to move on. [IN PIDGIN] Exactly, and stop acting the fool! Fool! - I don't know. I'm not going. - You are going. - No. - Yes. - We're gonna make sure. - Mm-hm. [ZAINAB] We have a plan for you. What plan? Plan for your reunion. [SIGHS] I already told you guys- Ladies. I'm not going. Won't you at least hear the plan first? No! Well, we're gonna tell you anyway. It's called Operation #PepperThemGang. [LAUGHS] What does that even mean? For someone so techie, you are completely useless when it comes to social media. Well... in non-social media slang, it means you are so going for the reunion. We don't take no for an answer. [TENI] Mm-hm. This is your opportunity for revenge! - But I don't want revenge. - Well, we want it for you. So... you're going. At least, won't you find out or won't you ask what this plan is? ["FUNK BEAT# 4" PLAYING] What's the plan? [ZAINAB] No woman wants a wimp of a man. We want a man whose chest is strong and solid. And whose muscles are big and firm. [TENI] It's great if a man is smart. But it wouldn't hurt if he is also cool stylish, and, most importantly, trendy. Think of Mark Zuckerberg in Dwayne Johnson's body, combined with stylish flair. So, after that, what next? You're going to go with this hot... [INHALES] ...you know, very hot girl as your girlfriend. What? I thought the plan was just for a makeover. Plans change. OK, look at it as the icing on the cake. Where am I supposed to get this "icing"? Teni. Yes, Teni can go with you. What? [ZAINAB] Yes. Teni said her sister hired a man at the last family reunion, and that's how we came up with this idea. I'm not going anywhere with him. And I think Teni here is our best bet. That wasn't part of the plan. Hmm. I thought you said plans change. Mm-hm. Figure it out. First of all... I am not going with a girl. And second... Wait. Wait, no, wait. I can actually hire someone to be my girlfriend? Yes. [ZAINAB] You know what? Let's do this, people! Let's do this! I need the money that I'm going to use to book the ride to take you two. OK. So... - how much is it? - Two hundred. - Two hundred, all right. - [ZAINAB] Ah. [GASPS] 200K, duh! Eh? What? Wait, wait, 200,000 naira? Uh-uh, kobo! No, wait, like, 200,000 naira? What kind of ride is this? Are we flying to the door? ["IMMEDIATELY" PLAYING] [JANE] Oh, my goodness! Walk that walk, girl! Shake that booty! Body be! Uh-uh-uh! [CLICKS FINGERS] Come here, give me a hug. You look so cute. Look at you! [THEY KISS] [LAUGHTER] Hi. - You look so good. - Thank you. [IN PIDGIN] Please, I need to understand, as big as I am. You guys passed and didn't see me? You're going to get your own sugar. Come to Daddy quickly. - [THEY LAUGH] - Hello, my love. How are you? You're looking good. - Thank you. - Oh, my God! - Every time you do this to me. - Oh, you guys. [LAUGHS] Come here. [HE CHUCKLES] [IN PIDGIN] Emeka, that's enough. My friend, go get your own girlfriend. What's wrong with you? You look so good. - Thank you. - Oh, my God. [JANE] That's enough. Look at you guys. - Damn, girl! - Oh, my goodness! Well, it's so good to have you guys here. - [JANE] Oh, my goodness, girl! - You look so good. Yeah. Has anyone seen Jide? - No. - No. - Uh-uh. - Yeah. I'll try his number. Let me try his number. Oh, yeah, it's good to see you. - I've seen that you put a ring on it. - Yeah! - Oh, right. - [LAUGHS] Oh, my goodness, he's such a great guy! Oh, my God! - Good to see you, too, man. - You're supposed to be here by now. [IN PIDGIN] You know how that guy acts. He's not coming. I dunno, maybe Jide's not coming. Did he tell you he's not coming? I don't know, but you know he doesn't socialize much, so... I mean, some things don't change, right? ["LAMBO" PLAYING] Look, he's here. Finally! - [EMEKA] Finally! - [NATH] They hear. [EMEKA IN PIDGIN] Let's clap for him. Finally! They are here! Finally! - [EMEKA] How you doing, bro? - [JIDE] How's it going, man? - What's up, man? You all right? - Yeah, man. [EMEKA IN PIDGIN] You kept us here like you are the captain of the boat. [JIDE IN PIDGIN] No, don't be angry. - I'm good, man. - Hello. I'm sorry, guys, sorry I had to keep you waiting. I had to... I had to pick her up. Erm, Jane. - Oh. Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you, Teni. [TENI] Nice to meet you, too. Erm, erm, my, er... my girlfriend. Huh? [NATH] Oh, OK. [EMEKA] Damn! Oh, erm... nice to meet you. - My name is Nathaniel. - Teni. Nice to meet you. Great. Erm, hi, Nifemi. Nice to meet you. Same here. Er, Emeka is my name. Oh, hello. Oh. That won't be necessary, but nice to meet you, though. [EMEKA] OK. [CHUCKLES] Whoo! [CHUCKLES] [TOYOSI] So... [CLEARS THROAT] ...I see that somebody has finally figured where they sell adult clothes. [LAUGHS] Mm. [TENI] Huh. This bitch is rude. And do you know what? I've got this. Baby, is this your ex? - Erm... - What's her name again? - Erm... - "Erm, erm, erm..." Exactly what I thought. He doesn't remember. [LAUGHS] Because she's not important. What's important is that... you belong to me... and she lost you. [TENI CACKLES] Oops! Erm, I think we should all get on the boat now. - Yeah, yeah. - Yeah, boat would be a good idea. Boat would be a good idea. [JANE] Everyone, get your stuff. Erm, yeah, we have to go to the boat. - Darling, let's go. - Yeah, we're ready. ["AMAKA CAN DANCE" PLAYING] [INDISTINCT] {an8}Oh, cool, thanks. OK, so you couples will stay in one chalet, while we singles stay in another chalet, OK? - OK, that's fine. That's all right. - All right. Wait. Are we supposed to share a room? You have a problem with that? Of course not. Right, baby? Right. Wait, you said you had two rooms in a chalet. And there are three of us left. So... Don't worry. Me and Toyosi are sharing the room, OK? So, you can do all your bad, bad things in peace. Oh, I get to keep a room to myself. Whoo! - Er, don't get too excited, OK? - Why? You're lucky someone brought a tag-along. You know what, guys? Let's all unpack, unwind. Guys, do whatever you guys do. Ladies, we're going to the pool, OK? And after that, dinner. [EMEKA] Yeah, whatever. Public service announcement: Nobody should come to my room. Do not disturb. Nobody. No disturbance. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [IN PIDGIN] Well, I like Jane, though. - She's nice. - Yeah, she is. Mm-hm. I wonder how you ended up with the worst of the lot. Like, did you hear at the reception she called me a tag-along. Teni, me, a tag-along. [IN PIDGIN] Ah, there are going to be problems. But you dig tag along, though. - Ow! - Are you supporting her? No, I'm just saying, though, I don't see what is wrong with what she said. Oh, really? So, what about what she said at the jetty? Eh? "Someone now knows where to buy adult clothes." [LAUGHS] You don't see anything wrong with that? She was just joking. Are you serious? Eh? So, you don't see anything wrong with that? It was a joke. Hey. [CLAPPING] Jide... there is a fine line between a joke and an insult. She clearly crossed that line. I don't think she was insulting me. How would you see when you're so stuck up on her? [CHUCKLES] Look, erm, I know you're here to help me... Then let me help you. Please, let me help you. You almost blew our cover when they asked us to stay in the same room. Because it's weird. How is it weird? Eh? Are we not friends? Maybe you have feelings for me. Wha...? Hell, no! You're crazy! Hmm. Well... in a good way, though. Look. Teni. I really appreciate you coming here, all right? With me. I really do. [IN PIDGIN] But men, you showed her, though. [CHUCKLES] See, I've had bitch practice. You people are lucky that I've changed now. - Eh? - A little. - OK, OK. - Shh. - Huh, Teni of life. - [PHONE VIBRATES, CHIMES] - What? - [EMEKA] What is up? Four thousand pounds! For what? - A complete wedding suit. - Eh? [IN PIDGIN] My friend, you are the one who decided to use foreigners. You'll engage most of our local designers likes of Taiwo, Yomi casual, all they need to do is measure you and you'll get an authentic suit for 200,000 only. Oh, come on, it's a one-off. You are a money bag. - Yo! - [EMEKA] Money bags! [LAUGHS] - How you doing, you all right? - Yeah, good, good, good. [IN PIDGIN] Ah, I don't know where these hands have been. [IN PIDGIN] Emeka, what is it? This one that you people are coming now, It's like you people... What were you people doing upstairs? You were doing quickie, right? [CHUCKLES] No. We were unpacking. Eh, same thing, now, unpacking all that tense energy. Unpacking, unpacking, unpacking... You know what? I'm just... I'm going to go join the girls at the poolside, OK? - [TENI] Excuse me. - Unpack, unpack, unpack. No, you'll stay here with us because they have finished releasing the energy. - Yeah. - [LAUGHS] [EMEKA] Boy! ♪ I see you baby... ♪ [IN PIDGIN] Emeka, see what you have caused? That's somebody's girlfriend, and you look like that. [IN PIDGIN] The person that owns the girlfriend doesn't mind, yet you are slapping me. And so what? Even if he doesn't mind, courtesy. - Jide, do you mind? - Must you ogle everything in skirts? [EMEKA] No, I was not ogling. I was only admiring the... the... the... the beautiful work of nature. I hear you. - I hear you. - But wait, on a serious note, what I don't understand is... how Jide... was able to get that girl. Ah-ah. What's your own now? [IN PIDGIN] No, but it is true now, because the Jide doesn't have that much courage to approach this kind of girl. [NATH LAUGHS] What if she was the one that approached me? [YELLS] My guy, take five! [IN PIDGIN] They're all over you. - [LAUGHTER] - Dangote! Otedola! [IN PIDGIN] Take a look at yourself. They are all over you. Come on, come off it. That's what happens when you're not chasing everything you see in skirts. Like some people we know. You are very stupid. [IN PIDGIN] Let Ogun set your mouth ablaze. [LAUGHTER] What I don't understand is, how guys want to eat the same food every day. How... how... how... What? [NATH] It's simple. L-O-V-E. Love. Just fall in love with the right woman. - Eh? - Love, yeah. [IN PIDGIN] I can't... I can't just do that, though. If you fall in love with the right person, love makes you stay with that one special woman. It's very simple. No. If that one is love, then I'm not interested. [IN PIDGIN] I want to eat a range of variety in my plate, some ogbono, rice, afang, and a bit of salad on the side. That's what you call eating. Emeka, listen. Let me tell you something, see? There's a certain joy that comes with... being with one woman. All right? Someone who shares your pain with you. Someone who shares your joy at the same time. Someone who holds your hand. Huh? Hold hand. [LAUGHTER] [IN PIDGIN] That is not a problem if it's to hold my hand. I have enough girls for that. I have girls that will hold onto my hand. If Funke holds my hand on Monday, Jenifer will hold it on Wednesday. On Sunday and Saturday, I'll hold on to it till Thursday They will all hold hands all through till Jesus [IN PIDGIN] Nath, please, what's up with the wedding preparations? Yo, bro, you don't wanna know. It's been crazy. I just saw a suit. Four thousand pounds. Can you imagine? [IN PIDGIN] If I buy a suit for £4,000. You know that I'll wear it till Jesus comes down. Saying, "My son, take off the suit." [LAUGHTER] [JANE] Let me give you the gist they gave me, right? They said it was not possible, like, seriously. - [LAUGHTER] - [INDISTINCT] It wasn't a joke. I mean, they wrote, "Four cows, a house on the island." Mama was like, "You guys may have to get me a new car." I was like, "This is not happening." [LAUGHTER] - [NIFE] Wow! What will be left now? - I don't even know. I'm telling you, like, wow! [LAUGHTER] Here comes the addendum. - [TENI] Hey, ladies. - Hi. It took you a while to come out. I hope everything is OK. Oh, yeah. Everything is fine. I just, erm... I just had to take my time. But then again, even if everything wasn't, I'm sure Jide can handle it. - [CHUCKLES] - He's a man's man. If you know what I mean. [JANE] Yeah. [TENI CHUCKLES] You know, I don't know how anybody can date Jide and leave him. Like, how? I mean... [CHUCKLES] [LAUGHS] [TENI CLEARS THROAT] Oh, towel. I've forgot my towel in the dressing room. Let me quickly go and get it, yeah? All right. Bye, ladies. [STIFLED LAUGHTER] Oh, my goodness! Was it just me or was she actually trying to get on my nerves? Honey, just ignore her. Just ignore her. OK, so you agree that she was trying to get on my nerves? - Calm down. - Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. What was that? Huh? "Oh, Jide is a man's man." [SCOFFS] The same Jide that I dated and dumped. Well, she picked him up and polished him. Come on, the girl is allowed to praise her man, so give her a break. - Let her do so without saying. - All right. "Oh, if someone didn't dump him, I wouldn't have him." Well, hell, yeah! Because if I didn't dump him... she wouldn't have him, and trust me... - I can get him back if I wanted. - Ah, Toyosi. [LAUGHS] - [NEFI] You sound like you like him. - [TOYOSI] I'm just saying. I am just saying, so she'd better be careful. Because if she annoys me one more time, just one more time... [CHUCKLES] ...Jide... [LAUGHS] [IN PIDGIN] I still know Jide's weakness. [CHUCKLES] I have him wrapped around my pretty little fingers. [IN PIDGIN] All right, Jide's weakness wrapped around wherever. Can we all get into this sweet pool and just relax? I feel like we could all use swimming. [LAUGHTER] Dive in. [LAUGHS] [CHATTER] - Hi, ladies. - Hi. Is that alcohol you're drinking? Is that alcohol you're drinking? [NATH] No, babe... babe, this is my first class. You know you're not supposed to be having any at all. But he just had one glass of wine. I don't care if it's a drop. He knows he's not supposed to be thinking. He wasn't the one drinking it. I was drinking it. It's obvious. - Bad company corrupts good manners. - Babe. - I'm bad company... - Well, I... I told him not to drink. You're crazy. Er, babe, come on, listen, I'm sorry. This is actually my first glass, and I promise I won't do it again. - All right? - Seriously? Babe, I swear to you I will not do it again. All right? - [LAUGHS] - I promise. Aww! Now that's a true love over there. [ZAINAB] Wow! [IN PIDGIN] Although for some people, even if true love punches them in the face, they will never recognize it. [IN PIDGIN] My dear, carry those two true love on your chest and punch me in my face. Let me see whether I wouldn't recognize it. Punch me now. Emeka, you're useless. - [LAUGHTER] - He's quite hopeless. [IN PIDGIN] You guys, choose one now. Hopeless or useless. Oh, honey, stop it. Stop, stop, stop. [LAUGHS] Get a room. - You know what? Honey! - I'm sorry. I'm actually really hungry, and I think Emeka should go get us dinner. - Yeah. - Make yourself useful. [IN IGBO] Me, Emeka? - Yes. - Ogun... fire that your mouth there. See, your boyfriend is there, licking your body. Yeah. [LAUGHS] And me, I should go find something to eat? Eh? Make yourself useful, Emeka. Come on, now, go get dinner. How can one be complaining about hunger? Oh, Emeka, we can go get it, all right? [IN PIDGIN] I mean, you're the gentleman. I'm not a gentleman at all. [NATH] Come on, let's impress the ladies for once. - [TOYOSI] Impress me! - [JANE] Yeah. If I leave here, it's my own food I'm going to order. I don't care about these ladies. [JANE] You know what I want. - What do you guys want? - [NIFE] I want prawns. - Prawns. - Get me fried rice and chicken. - Emeka, that's for you. - Prawns. - Prawns and stir-fry. - Fried rice for you. [IN PIDGIN] Emeka, hook me up, please. [TENI] Erm, I just need to pee, OK? I'll be back. Relax. I promise. Girls, and so famished. Extremely famished. Whoo! - Where you going? - What? [SIGHS] OK. Well, want to go and say hi to an ex who happens to be my friend. - Toyosi. - What? [CHUCKLES] I won't recognize love even if he hits me, right? - You started it. - No, no, no, no, no, no. She started it. Mm-hm? She loves Jide, right? Now, let's see how much Jide loves her. Going somewhere? Hm? I, erm... - Er, the key. - [CHUCKLES] [INDISTINCT CONVERSATION] Excuse us. [LAUGHTER] That was right timely, don't you think? Just watch. [JANE] We're waiting for food, actually. Honey, I'm hungry. I don't know what your problem is. [LAUGHS] That was just so timely. Speaking of time. What was that? Why were you smiling like a kid who just saw candy? She was talking to me. We haven't had a conversation in years. That wasn't a conversation, boy. You were drooling. I wasn't drooling. - You were. - I didn't do that. Yes, you did. OK, maybe I did a bit. But she was talking to me. We spoke. Maybe she wants me back. Oh, wait, hold up. Wait a minute. This is not Operation #GetTheGirlBack. This is Operation PepperThemGang! - Don't you get it? - Eh, Maybe we can do both. All right? You can pepper her, and maybe then she wants me back. That way, everybody gets what they want. [SIGHS] [EXHALES] OK. Fine. If that's what you want, you're gonna get the girl back. But... you must do whatever I tell you to do. Exactly what I tell you to do. Anything. Good. - ...hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry. - [LAUGHTER] [TENI] Rule number one... If she cracks a joke... you must never, ever laugh, no matter how funny it is. When she asks you a question, answer only in monosyllables. Erm, Jide? So, I hear that you are a tech guru at your firm. What's that like? Hm? Erm... [CLEARS THROAT] ...about that, I, er... there are a few things that, erm... Er, great. It's... it's great. [TENI] You will in no way or form have direct contact with her. Avoid her as much as possible. Jide, would you be kind enough to pass me the salad, please? Sure. I'll get it for you. OK? [SHRIEKS] - Ah! - What did you do that for, now? Get a hold of your girlfriend. What kind of rubbish is this? Nah, I'm OK. - This food is tasty. [CHUCKLES] - [JANE] Yeah, it is. Zainab, I honestly wanted to pour that salad on her. Teni. Teni, be serious. Be serious. Maybe she didn't want it anymore, now. How about maybe she was just trying to spite me? [CHUCKLES] Are you sure? - Teni, I really think you should chill. - Did you hear him? Trust our homeboy to still be in love with her. Very annoying. [SCOFFS, SIGHS] [LAUGHS] What are you doing? [IN PIDGIN] Please move away. Don't sit beside me! You are not sleeping on this bed this night. [LAUGHS] Teni, stop, now. Teni, please, now, take it easy with him. Come on. Have mercy for what? All the things I told this boy to do, he didn't even do one single one. Teni, but I... But what? But what? [BABBLES MOCKINGLY] [LAUGHS] Oh, Teni! In fact, your punishment is you're going to sleep on the floor. Teni, please... Teni, what is the meaning of this, now? Are you being really serious right now? [BABBLES MOCKINGLY] Does this, my posture, does it look like a joker to you? Teni, please, I am very tired and I'm very sleepy. Please. "I'm very tired and very sleepy. Please." Go and lay down on the floor. Bye. - This is why... - Sweet dreams. This is why you are very crazy. I feel sorry for the person that will end up with you. Eh? You say what? Nothing. Next time, when I tell you to do something you do it. By the time your body pains you tomorrow morning, you will remember. [MOANS SLEEPILY] Come here to me, bed. I love my space. [SINGING] All the bed to myself. I'm so free. Yeah. [IN YORUBA] Please help me. Teni, now. Please, can you hear me? Teni? - [JIDE GRUNTS] - My goodness! You scared me. Sorry. What are you doing here? Did you and Teni have a fight? [SUCKS TEETH] Hm. What are you still doing awake? Over. Travel insomnia. What's that? Inability to sleep when you arrive at a new destination. It usually takes me, like, two days to adjust, I guess. OK, I don't think I've ever had that. Not like I travel a lot. It's people like you that spoil business for people like me. See your face. Oh, come on, it's... it's work. I just get really occupied with work. All work and no play. You know what? I think I can organize a vacation for you. You know, it doesn't have to be like a very, very fancy place, not too much money. Nice place, and you can also go with Teni. - What do you think? - [LAUGHS] Wait, wait, are you... are you marketing me now? Ah. A girl's got to make some cash. [CHUCKLES] OK, OK. So, if you were to recommend a vacation, where would you advise? [LAUGHS] I need to hear this gist very well. Move over. OK. So... nice. Trust me. You haven't lived until you've been to Paris. Yeah. Erm... the most dramatic city in the whole world. - You know this. - [THEY LAUGH] Yeah. - Yeah. - [SIGHS] I can't wait to go there with someone I love. Yeah. Lucky you. You already have someone. [CHUCKLES] Yeah. You've been talking to me about cities and the world for over two hours now. You must really love your job. I apologize. [CHUCKLES] Trust me, I get to talking lots when I'm passionate about something. Sorry. It's OK. No need to apologize. What is life without passion? So... yeah. So, tell me. What are you passionate about? Erm... [CLEARS THROAT] I... [GENTLE PIANO MUSIC] [SHE MOANS LIGHTLY] Sorry. Sorry. Good morning. - Is it morning already? - Mm. It's er... 6.30. It's already six. [GASPS] Erm, sorry for sleeping off on you, OK? It's all right. Sorry I slept off on you, too. [SIGHS] I should get back to my room. Yeah, yeah, me too. What time is it? Mm? Seven. [MOANS] Did you get any sleep? Your eyes are red, though/ - Hm? - You threw me on the floor. Did you think I would get any sleep? Er, yeah. I slept like a baby. I don't even think I've slept this good in a very long time. [IN YORUBA] Sorry. ["FUNKYBEAT# 4" PLAYING] Did you manage to get some sleep? No, no, no, no, I've just had some coffee. And I've been wide-eyed since. I can imagine. I see Emeka brought his PS3. You know he doesn't go anywhere without it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Whoa! You're pretty good. You say that like you're surprised. I am! Pleasantly so. [LAUGHS] [IN PIDGIN] Pick up the pad, let me beat you a little. Oh, yeah, now. Whoo! [IN PIDGIN] Guys, last night was amazing. [IN PIDGIN] Are you angry? Can you imagine this guy? What happened? I came to ask if I could sleep in his room and he slammed the door in my face. Brother, I honestly wish I could tell you that I am sorry right now, but from the bottom of my heart... I'm not! [LAUGHS, CLAPS HANDS] Bro! Last night was gone. [IN PIDGIN] We had fun so intensely that we leveled the bed It is totally spoilt. Brother, look, why are you keeping your face that way? Look, I'm not the reason for you and your girlfriend's quarrel. We didn't plan to stay in the same room in this resort. Please, let's leave this guy. Come on let's go... You will hear my gist. Come, come, come! Wait, wait, wait, wait! [LAUGHING] - So, the girl said... - Let's go for a walk - Wait, wait! - Rubbish! [IN PIDGIN] You people should come. Let's gist, scallywags. [IN PIDGIN] Damn it. So, you, I can't believe you are vexing for Emeka. What did you expect? I don't mind him. The guy's just so annoying. Let's talk about more interesting things, please. Like what? - Like you, now. - Me? Yes. I mean, like, I didn't know you were a bundle of surprises. For example, I did know you know how to play PS. There are so many things you don't know about me. Oh, come on, that's not true. - It's actually very, very true. - OK. Try me. Hmm... let's think. How many siblings do I have? That's easy, now. Three. OK, that was too easy. Oh, yeah. Hit me. - Like this? - No! [LAUGHS] OK, OK, OK, OK, let me think, let me think. Erm... Who's my favorite musician? Erm... what's the name of the song that won multiple awards...? - erm... - "Beautiful Love." Yes! I have that song on repeat in my car for the longest. Me too. I love that song. - Oh! He has a new single out. - Really? Yeah! It's just a few days' old now. And I don't know it. - I have it on my phone. - OK, play, play, play, play. Over to you. It's a nice song. - Let me hear. - OK. So, ladies first. I can't believe you heard it before me. [MUSIC PLAYING] Ah. Wow. - ♪ I've been searching... ♪ - This guy, this guy's magic. - So, magical. - Yeah, he is. You're having goosebumps. ♪ Searching... ♪ It's kind of chilly, isn't it? [PHONE VIBRATING, RINGING] Oh, shit. Erm... Your girlfriend. [SIGHS] Sorry. Let me just take this call. Erm, hello? [CHATTER] Hey. Oh, hey! [LAUGHTER] Where are you guys coming from? Oh, we, er... we took a stroll. - Nice. Yeah. - [JANE] Oh, OK. Are still mad at me? Nope. Remember, I'm kind of getting used to you bullying me. Good. I was just checking. [LAUGHS] Because you know that I don't like it when you leave me. I miss you when you're not around me. Aw. I'm sorry, baby. Erm, guys, meanwhile, I heard that tonight is their bonfire night here, and there's going to be lots of booze and babes. [ALL EXCLAIM] It's gonna be lit! Lit! Let's go! That's the only place to see. Lit! [LAUGHTER] You guys, you know this reminds me of school days. You know, the parties, karaoke night. - [IN PIDGIN] Give it some volume! - [ALL CHEERING] [IN PIDGIN] Run away, man! I can remember, like, we had so much fun. We did. We did. - Oh, my goodness. - [NATH] It was great. You know, I also like karaoke... And I remember when the six of us used to go to the karaoke night almost every Friday night. [LAUGHTER] Well, we all just passed our exams, except for some of us. [IN PIDGIN] My thunder strikes you there. My thunder strikes you there. OK? Look at doing badly with my two-two, guys Hello, third-class, you mean. - [LAUGHTER] - [IN PIDGIN] I have more money than you. Ah, don't even try my baby! Don't try my baby! [IN PIDGIN] You will explode. You don't wanna try my baby. - Rich people don't talk. - Exactly. - Rich people don't talk. - Exactly. Oh, my goodness! Er, Jide, do you remember when we had a duet at the karaoke night special? Oh, yeah, you, yeah. [TOYOSI AND JIDE SINGING] [ALL JOIN IN] - Oh! - [LAUGHTER] [TENI] You see how this girl are just using this goat to catch trips? Jide, who sang that song? I'm thinking Adekunle Gold, right? - No, Oliver de Coque. - [LAUGHS] How could I even forget that? And come to think of it, I think those were one of our best moments ever. Yeah. Ow! Are you OK? Nah, he's fine. He's OK. It was just a little muscle pull, right, baby? - Yeah, yeah, sure, sure. - Right. So, Jide, tell me, do you still wear those Spider-Man boxers? Spider-Man? Wait, you wear Spider-Man boxers? - Come on. - [NATH] What? As in actual Spider-Man boxers? Oh, my God! No, no, but guys, I thought it was very cute. - It was... - [TOYOSI] Trust me. - Jide... - It was back in the day. - Jide, you wear Spider-Man boxers? - No... You know what? I'm done with you. I loved it, OK? - [JANE] I like those boxers. - I would do anything to take it back. [NATH] What you mean? [JANE] Maybe you could be drastic and the extra and everything. [LAUGHS] Can I, erm, see you for a minute, baby? Like, now? - Now. - Sure, OK. Fine. Good baby. - Are you OK? - Are you OK? Am I OK? The question should be: Are you OK? What did I do? Hm, what did you not do? Eh? First of all, you left me out of the conversation and made that stupid girl happy. Teni, we were talking about our pasts. You were not part of it, so obviously, you are going to feel left out. But... Yeah, whatever. What is paining me is the fact that you allowed that girl to play you like a violin. Ha! And you're there just smiling. Without an iota of shame! My guy. My guy, you've seen her, now. What am I going to do? She's like a goddess. Hmm. [IN PIDGIN] It's true, though. That girl is fine. [SUCKS TEETH] [CHUCKLES] Did you really used to wear Spider-Man boxers? [LAUGHS] That's why she left you. No wonder! - [LAUGHS] - Teni? What? Even me, I forgive you. [IN IGBO] God forbid! [SNICKERS] Look. Love is not a respecter of boxers. [LAUGHS] Yeah. You're actually right. You're right. But true love is so hard to find these days. So hard. What, you've never been in love before? [GENTLE PIANO MUSIC] I have. I actually thought I was but... [SIGHS] frankly, he just... turned out to be a jerk. I threw him out after our last family reunion. Wait. The same one your sister hired a man to? Yep. [CHUCKLES] That would have been one hell of a reunion. Trust me. You don't know the half of it. [IN PIDGIN] Interesting. Teni of life. [THEY LAUGH] So, you see, that was totally uncalled for. Jane is right. Jide, he is with his girlfriend, and it's totally unfair for you to just be hitting on him in front of her. [SCOFFS] Please, what are you talking about? Hm? I haven't even done a thing yet. You don't even like this guy, so why you doing this? Because I can. [JANE] You're unbelievable. [IN PIDGIN] Zainab, that's how your guy has been messing up here. Uh-huh? Is she that hot? [IN PIDGIN] I won't lie. Please, the girl is hot. But we shall overcome. Hotter than you? Hotter than me? My God! [CHUCKLES] Whatever. I hope you are making out time to rest. Because you need rest. - [CHUCKLES] - Teni, erm... I'm going for a swim. You wanna come? No, thank you. I'm on the phone with Zainab. Oh, OK. Hi, Zainab. Give me gist. Teni, talk now. [IN PIDGIN] You like gist too much. ["LAMBO" PLAYING] [NATH] Anything for you. [JANE] Yeah, you see? Hello. Hey. - Toyosi. - Sparta. - [JIDE] What's wrong with you? - Toyosi? Yes? - Are you OK? - Yeah. Of course. Yeah, I'm fine. - [NATH] Are you sure? - Yeah. What? [JANE] I was asking about clothes for the wedding. - And you just zoned out. - Oh, erm... Black? - [NATH] Black? - [JANE LAUGHS] Who wears black on their wedding day, Toyosi? You're very distracted, and I can see why. [NATH] It's not a funeral. Come on! [NATH] Sparta, please, go and put on some shirts, all right? - Go and wear your shirt, please. - No, no, no, black. Black. [DRUMS BEATING, SINGING] [SIGHS] Yeah, Zainab. Sorry that I'm calling so late. Erm, please help me... log onto my desktop tomorrow and confirm it's sorted. Yeah? OK. All right. Thanks a lot, yeah. Yeah, Teni is fine. She, er... she went out for the... We're having this bonfire night, so that's where she went. I'm gonna catch up with her later. Yeah. Yeah. [CHUCKLES] All right. Thanks, Zee. All right, now, take it easy. Bye. [DRUMS BEATING, SINGING] [WHOOPING] Hello? Hello, hello? Can you hear me? I'm in a noisy place. Yeah, I can hear you, I can hear you. I don't understand. What do you mean by that? Ah-ah. I booked the hotel for you myself. I booked it myself. What do you mean the confirmation does not exist? You know what? Don't worry. I'll check. Don't worry. I'll check. I'm going in right now. I'll check. I'll get back to you. Just give me ten minutes. I promise I'll get back to you. [INDISTINCT] Hey. Hey. Er, why are you going back? Oh, I got a call from a client. She's upset that she didn't get a hotel booking confirmation. Wow. Yeah. So, what are you going to do? I'll just mail her back the email I got. That's it. I was trying to connect to the hotel Wi-Fi... - [PHONE RINGING] - One second. OK. Hello? Oh, thank God. [CHUCKLES] No, it's OK. It's fine. It's fine. Yeah, enjoy your vacation. OK, thanks. Bye-bye. So, I take it that the problem has been solved? - Yep. [CHUCKLES] - Yes! - So, you want to go back? - No, I'm tired. That was too long, and it's almost over. Oh, OK. - So, do you wanna chill somewhere? - Yeah, sure. [ROMANTIC MUSIC] - Er, have you seen Greatest Showman? - That's my favorite movie of all time. Are you serious? That's my favorite movie too! - I'm obsessed with it. - Oh, well, that's dope, man.

What's your excuse? Teni... Teni is a snoring badly. [LAUGHS] [JIDE CHUCKLES] Wow! You're a very horrible boyfriend. But it's the truth. Like, you can't even stay in the room. OK. [CHUCKLES] [ROMANTIC MUSIC] What, what's up? Nothing. Nothing, it's not important. Are you OK? Yeah. Anyway, I've been meaning to say, erm, you know, all of this, putting all of this together, bringing all of us together was a great idea. Thank you. Even though I wasn't going to come. Why not? For... for obvious reasons. Toyosi, right? Yep. [SIGHS] What's even going on between you guys? It's a long story. Can we just... Let's just look for someone to sit down and talk. OK. No problem. Let's go. I mean, she treated you like trash, and... you are letting her in again. Even though you have a girlfriend. No, I... I must admit... every time I see her, my heart just... races. You know? But... - I, erm... - But what? If I'm going to be honest... there's just something missing. You know? Wait, so if Teni wasn't in the picture... - Mm-hm. - ...and Toyosi came running, would you hesitate? I guess. OK, so now I know there's something you wanna say. Come on. Talk to me, now. Nothing. Don't worry. Come... I thought we were sharing secrets. Your secret's that you've been in love with Toyosi all your life. How is that a secret? Everybody knows that. OK, so, I tell you what's gonna happened, all right? You tell me what's going on, and I will tell you a secret. [GENTLE PIANO MUSIC] OK. I like you. [SIGHS] I always have. OK, erm... I... I didn't have any clue. You see why I shouldn't have said anything. No. I mean, you always had Toyosi. And now you have Teni. - Teni's not my girlfriend. - [MUSIC STOPS] - No, look... - Wait. Erm... What? Wait, what? I don't understand. Can you explain? [SIGHS] [CHUCKLES] I can't believe you. I don't believe you. - Yeah. - [CHUCKLES] The crazy things that Zainab and Teni make me do. Wow! So, all of this just to make Toyosi jealous? Yeah. They call it, erm, Operation... #PepperThem... Something silly like that. I don't know. [CHUCKLES] Wow. - Teni's crazy. - Oh! She is. - She is. - But I like her. She's cool. I'm glad you do. - [GENTLE PIANO MUSIC] - So... now that you don't have a girlfriend... What are you saying? What now? [PHONE VIBRATING, RINGING] [CHUCKLES] Sorry. It's... Yeah, yeah, it's fine. So, you see... - It's just a text message. - OK. I have to go inside. All right. I'm sorry. Bye. Hey. Someone is finally awake. [GROANS] How long have I been asleep? For the better part of the morning. Oh, my! [TUTS] My head is banging. Ah, that's the result of excessive drinking. Where are the others? At the beach. Why aren't you with them? [CHUCKLES] Well, I decided to stay back... - Why? - ...and make you some coffee. Somebody has to take care of you, right? Here. It's hot. Be careful. There. [JIDE CHUCKLES] [SIPS] Oh. - Who are you chatting with? - Nife. She's asking if you are awake. And if we are coming over to the beach. The way my head is pounding... I'll have to pass, but you can go. Really? Yep. I'll join you guys later. Considering that Jezebel is still in the picture. I can see you got your groove back. - Yeah, baby. - [CHUCKLES] - Ouch. - All right. - I'll see you later. - Mm. [UPBEAT MUSIC] [PHONE VIBRATING] [PHONE CHIMES] [INDISTINCT] [INDISTINCT] [CLEARS THROAT] Hey, handsome. You are just the man I wanted to see. Why? I don't know.

Are you avoiding me? Are you sure? I have missed you. No. I miss you. You miss me? Yes. ["LOVE YOURSELF" PLAYING] Don't you miss me? Hey. Erm, can I sit? Of course. Erm... Hm. Are you OK?

I know I'm not really your friend, But Jide is my friend, so you can... Hi. So, here you are. We've been looking for you all over the beach. You're not even picking your calls. Why? I left my phone in the room. That's all. Nife, are you OK? Someone is upset. Why? [NATH] Come here. What's wrong with you? Did you do anything? No, I didn't do anything.

Are you sure? Yeah. I just need to rest, that's all. OK. So, Jide and I kissed. I'm happy for you. [CHUCKLES] Listen. I know you don't exactly approve of Jide and I because he has a girlfriend, but hey, they're not married, right? And if he really loved her that much, he wouldn't kiss me, would he? You got what you wanted. Yes, but... I think I might be liking him. I mean, what's there not to like? Huh? He's smart, he's buff, he's sexy. [GIGGLES] He's my perfect guy. Well, I guess you win. We'll see about that. [CHUCKLES] Hey. [CHUCKLES] - What's up, bro? - What's up? Good, man. You all right? Yeah. Yeah, I'm good, man. [LAUGHS] - Oh, sorry. - What? I thought you don't drink. - There's always a first. - Oh! [CHUCKLES] Never start what you can't finish. Take this from a man who's been there and done that. [CHUCKLES] Right. What are you even doing here? Let's say I came to have a me-time. Yo, can I have some water? Thank you. Thank you. You good? - Yeah, yeah, good. - You sure? - Yeah. - All right. - How did you do it? - Hm? How... how did you do it? How... did you and Jane stay for so long? How did you know she's the one? Oh. [CHUCKLES] [ROMANTIC MUSIC] Very deep. Jide... [CLEARS THROAT] ...you see... I'm a very real person. Yes. I never get to pretend when I'm with her. I mean, I can... cry. I can laugh. I try to be real. No airs, no pressure. When I'm with her... I... I feel like I'm home. And home is where the heart belongs. And I strongly believe mine is safe with her. So, yeah, that's my story. [CHUCKLES] ["LOVE YOURSELF" PLAYING] Are you OK? Yeah. You've been quiet and moody all morning. Are you sure everything's fine? Jane, please, can you just give me a minute? I just want to be on my own. I need some air. I'm not in the mood to talk. Please. All right. Sure. Hey, what's up? Erm, everybody's in the restaurant. What are you doing here? Nothing. OK. Erm... I sent you a text last night. Did you see it? Yes. Nife, are you OK? Yes! [HUFFS] Hey. Going somewhere? - Erm... - "Er..." [CHUCKLES] You know, I've not been able to get over our kiss last night. I've thought about it all... night. [CLEARS THROAT] Hm? Isn't it too early to be stalking my man? [LAUGHS] I don't have to stalk what I already have. What's going on? Nothing. Nothing. Erm... Look, I, erm... I wanna use the bathroom. OK? Excuse me. Nife? Nife, wait. What's wrong? I saw you kiss Toyosi. - You see... It's OK. - Nife... It's actually fine. It's OK. No problem. Nife, please, wait. I understand that she's your Achilles' heel. She's always been. I can't compete with that. I don't even want to compete with that. Come on, Nife. [NIFE SNIFFLES] From now on, I just want to be left alone. Nife, come on, all right? Nife? [PANTING] What's going on? Eh? I was asking you a question and you just walked out.

Hm. - Toyosi... - Don't you dare call my name. - How could you betray me like this... - I didn't betray you. [TOYOSI SCOFFS] You don't betray me, but he loves you. How? - Hm? Tell me. - He saw the light. You are my friend. You're supposed to have my back. - Not steal my man. - I did not steal your man. Hm. But you knew I wanted him back. [JIDE SCOFFS] - For selfish reasons... - Oh, shut up, tramp! Teni, no, no, no, no, no. No... Me? - Tr... - Teni. You know what? Enough of this bitch right here. Teni, calm down. [TOYOSI SHRIEKING] Hey! Hey! Back, guys! Back, back! Wait, wait, wait, wait, stop! - [TOYOSI] Get off me! - [NATH] Hey, hey, guys! - OK, take it easy. - [NATH] Stop it. Stop it, stop it! [JANE] What are you doing? - Stop it. - [EMEKA] Let me see them fight. Fight. You know what? I've had it. I've had it! I've had it with all of you! I've had it with you! I've had it with you, you, you! All of you! Go to hell! All of you! - [SHOUTING] - [TOYOSI SHRIEKING] [SHRIEKING, SHOUTING] Teni, it's OK. It's OK. [SHRIEKS] Go to hell! All over you, go to hell! What's wrong with all of you? We all came here to have fun! [IN PIDGIN] Are you guys kissing for real? [JANE CHUCKLES] Anyway... [EMEKA IN PIDGIN] Boss. ...I'm happy for you guys, new lovebirds in town. - [NIFE GIGGLES] - I'm happy for you guys. Thank you. [LAUGHS] - Wait, wait, but you guys knew? - Of course, we knew! - Wait, how? - Look, we've been friends for so long. It's impossible for us not to know. We know you guys very well, now. [TENI] Congratulations. I'm, er... I approve of you. You're a good girl. - Who approved of who? And tell me why. - All right. Are you now my mother? OK, OK, OK, sorry. Sorry. [LAUGHTER] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [JIDE] Remind me not to fight with you again. [UPBEAT MUSIC] [INDISTINCT] I remember two beautiful ladies once told me that plans change. [CHUCKLES] Plus... I'm suave like that. [LAUGHTER] [ROMANTIC MUSIC] [JIDE] Falling in love is a beautiful thing, but being in love, it makes all the difference in the world. A friend once told me that you would know when you find the one because she would feel like home. She'll change the notion that you had all your life that a home is made of bricks and mortar and will let you know that it's indeed made of flesh and blood. [INDISTINCT] Erm, I would like to propose a toast. Oh. A toast. To love. And to friendship. Both old... and new. -Friendship. Friendship, guys -[ALL] Friendship.
