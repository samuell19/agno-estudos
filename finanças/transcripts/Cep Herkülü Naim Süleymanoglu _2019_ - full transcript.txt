THIS MOVIE IS BASED ON THE REAL LIFE OF WORLD AND OLYMPIC CHAMPION NAIM SULEYMANOGLU, ADAPTED FROM THE BOOK "LITTLE HERCULES, MY BROTHER NAIM" BY MUHARREM SULEYMANOGLU. 1977, MOMCHILGRAD, BULGARIA -Mom! -Naim! You dirty rascal. Were you swimming in the creek again? -What happened? -You're soaked. -Way to go, boy. -You're soaking wet! Easy. LABOR-COOPERATIVE FARM SUCCESS AND GLORY OF WORK! Wait. Good boy. Good boy. Way to go! Naim! Muharrem, Raim. Supper is ready. Sit down. Shouldn't we wait for Dad? He's at work. I'll wait for him. You go ahead. -I'll wait for Daddy. -Me too! -Where are you going? -I'm hungry. Okay, I'm getting it. The food will get cold! Your dad will be here soon! Come to the table! Who am I talking to? Naim, Raim, come to the table! -I'm hungry. -Okay, it's coming. Wait. -Dad brought the bus home, Mom. -A bus! What the... What bus? Move. -What is it? -Move. Move. I'll take my shoes off. Clear the table. Come on. Take everything off. Go on. Quick. Don't put that on the table. I'll drop the bus off at the garage and be right back. Do not touch the box until I'm back. The kids were going to eat. Don't touch it. Daddy told us to wait. -It's a TV! -Yes. TV! TV! TV! Let's open it. Naim, you hold the box. Did you put us on the list for a TV? Yeah, five years ago. You were three. You wouldn't remember. It's heavy. Put that stuff away. -Come on. Clear the table. -Go easy. Now you can watch TV right here. And instead of going to other people's homes, you will call them here. -Stop it, don't break it on the first day. -Let's connect the antenna. -Do it later. -TV! Oh, gosh! The food is getting cold. One by one. Stay in line. Stay there, wait. Come on. Wait there. One by one. Look, I've told you 50 times already. So, again, spread your legs shoulder width apart. Grab it right across your feet. As you lift the barbell up... you will position yourself like this. That's it. Let me see you do it, Ivan. Drop it. Now it’s your turn, Sasho. He told you 50 times. You grab it like this. He said for you to lift it like this first. Then... you'll quickly spread your legs. Like you're jumping. Naim. Have you done some weightlifting before? Would you like to do it? Why not? Don't you want to be an athlete? I do. Table tennis, swimming maybe. Come to Kardzali and join our team. Weightlifting is a man's sport, boy. -You work in Kardzali? -Yeah. And I know Coach Enver. -My dad drives the Kardzali bus. -Then he should bring you. Naim, Muharrem! You've entered without tickets again? How long are you gonna keep driving me mad like this? Enter without a ticket again, and I'll rip your ears off! KARDZALI, BULGARIA KARDZHALI-MOMCHILGRAD Dad, Kardzali is so big. Of course it is. What did I tell you? BUS STATION KARDZALI SPORTS SCHOOL I only brought him here because of Enver's request. -What the hell is weightlifting? -Don't say that, Mr. Suleyman. Weightlifting is cool. His mother heard that if he were to start at this age, he wouldn't grow tall or have any kids. She told him and he got scared. With time, you'll put on the weight and you'll learn the snatch. Hilmi, you're here. Welcome, Suleyman. Sorry for the trouble. No trouble. We're honored. Welcome, Naim. -Kiss your coach's hand, boy. -Wait. If I can help you in any way, then we'll consider hand kissing. Go practice with Hilmi on the mat. Come on. Let's go. We have a small number of athletes. Wrestling is very popular, but weightlifting? Not so much. We need to raise athletes, Suleyman. Hilmi spoke highly of your boy. Let's see if there's any truth to it. What do you say, Coach? You see any light in there? Would you look at that. Hold on, Hilmi. Hilmi trained you at Momchilgrad, right? He showed me some stuff. Would you like to come here and train with me during the weekends? Wouldn't you? I will hold a tournament here in a month. Wouldn't you like to participate in it? -There's a medal for the winner. -A medal? -And it's gold. -Really? So, let's train today. -What do you say? -Okay. Let us train today, Suleyman. You'll pick him up in the evening, okay? Wait, be careful. Watch the distance between your feet. It needs to be shoulder width. Spread them wider. See you later. Take it easy with him. Spread them. -What grade are you in? -I speak Turkish. So... what grade are you in? Students... you may begin your games. Check... mate. Congrats. Don't worry, maybe you'll win one day. Here is your medal in the 22 kg category. Way to go. -You've lifted more than your own weight. -Did I win? Sure you did. You won the gold medal. Look. -Way to go. -Congrats, Enver. We fully support you holding tournaments like this on your own. Okay. You go change. The newcomers just need a little encouragement. You can give medals out like candy, but he's too young. What's he doing in here? How old is he? -Ten. -What? He can't do this now. Regulations state that the minimum age is 14. -Sofia is very strict about this. -It'll be fine. There are scientific studies that support starting at that age. You saw how they applauded you in there? Your dad has agreed to four-week training. And it went so fast. Maybe if you talk to him, I can practice another couple of weeks. Now you have a big responsibility. You may not realize just yet... but this medal is heavier than a barbell. Once every week won't cut it. Let me move you to Kardzali and have you join the sports school. And you'll officially be part of this team. -Like, staying here? -Of course. We have a sports hotel. You'll stay there. With Brother Hilmi. -You wanna come? -I don't know. What's holding you back? -Now, tell me. -Okay... will my mom agree to this? He's too young to be in Kardzali. And he'll be all alone. Naim is not used to big cities. A car might hit him. Thank you, Enver. This is all good... but is it right to take a ten-year-old away from his home? He won't be away from his home. He'll be here on the weekends. He will. For two days. With all due respect, why did you have to pick my child? Aren't there any other athletes here? That's a very good question, Sister Hatice. Why did I pick your boy over all the other children? Well, this kid that you gave birth to, Sister Hatice, he's got a God given gift. You should be mad at yourself for having a child with this talent. You haven't slept yet? Naim... do you want to go to Kardzali? I won't go if you say I can't, Mom. You're too young. I'm not. I won a medal. Yes. Yes, you did. Okay. But won't you be afraid? What will you do there all alone? Why would I be afraid? Wouldn't you miss us? Sure. I won't go if you ask me not to. Your mouth is saying one thing. Yet your heart says something else. I hope it ends well. -Welcome. -Come on. SPORTS DORMITORY - KARDZHALI This one, too. Naim, you forgot this bag. This is your room. You will be staying here with your older brothers. And this is your bed. And there's your closet. Go on, tiger, settle in. -Yes? -This is a new student, Naim. -Kids, let's welcome Naim. -Welcome, Naim. You may sit. WE GROW UP AND STUDY FREELY! -They let me carry the team flag. -Oh, my goodness! That's great. Of course he will have you carry it. Like father, like son. COUNTY HOSPITAL Squat, squat, squat... And jump! Yes. Here we go again. We will repeat. Going down. Squat... Yes. Always bend your knees. Yes! Lock your elbows. When you jump, they should not move. Your back must be straight. Yeah. Pull. Control your breathing. Straight back. Eyes forward. Pull. Yes. Look straight ahead. Okay? Again. Yes! Get up. Do it like this. Got it? Hold it, yes. Hold, hold, hold. Now, drop it, and jump. Yes! Naim, what are you doing? He's right. He says he should be playing at the park, but I'm making him train here. He should also play and enjoy his childhood. Pull now! Hold, hold, hold. Hold it like that and then drop it. Don't bend your elbows. Don't bend them. You should lower it correctly. Now, go. Leave it. Out! Out! Let me hear your breathing. Let me hear it. Okay. Inhale and exhale. Again. And again. Now, pull! Let's control this breathing. In and out. Now, pull! Bravo! You will lift it with your heart and with your soul. You will not think about anything else. Spread your legs. Yes. Not too much. Okay. Now, squat slowly. Stand up. Straight. Always stand straight. One more time. These feet will walk many more miles. They will support a lot of weight. A lot. Okay, now. Godspeed, little man. How come they are saying my boy is older? It's only on paper. They did a bunch of tests. His body growth is already over his age. Only on paper. That's the worst part. They chose him for the tournament in Vidin. Enver is pushing the officials to change the weightlifting minimum age regulation. -He managed to take it down to 14. -My boy is so young. Naim, do you remember Sylvia Yankova? -The chess champion of our school. -Yeah. She went to Sofia to live with her nana. She left this for you. They put Sylvia's father in jail. -I told you to keep quiet about that. -But everybody knows -they supported the Turks-- -Zip it! What did I just say? Get your atlas. You come over here, too. Give it to me. Let's see where this Vidin is. This is Momchilgrad. And Vidin is over here. VIDIN, BULGARIA WEIGHTLIFTING CHAMPIONSHIP Look who's here, Naim. Ivan Abadjiev. That's Ivan Abadjiev? Sure is. He's the coach of all coaches. He trains the National Team. I want him to see you today. And if he likes me? Then your next stop will be the National Team camp. -In Sofia? -Sure. If you succeed there as well, you'll be selected for the National Team. Sofia is far away. Those who stand in the shadows won't have a shadow of their own, Naim. You have to stand in the sun to become a shadow yourself. So the people can gather in your shadow. Kardzali is just a province. The door to the world is over there. Go on, show yourself. N. SULEYMANOV Lift! Hold! Hold! 1982. BULGARIA NATIONAL TEAM CAMP SOFIA Now... push! Lift! Stand straight! Straight! Close the legs! Close 'em! Stand straight! Bravo! Bravo, son. -You realize how much you just lifted? -Yes, sir. -And how many times you did it? -Yes, sir. -If I put you on the National Team... -Yes, sir. -...will you lift the same in São Paulo? -Yes, sir! -How much? -As much as you want me to lift. Good boy! I want you like this. Kosta, read the names that are going to São Paulo. These are the athletes representing the Bulgarian National Team that will compete in Brazil: Stefan Topurov. Asen Zlatev. Naim Suleymanov. Show me. Where will they take Naim to compete? Brazil, Brazil... No, Brazil is not there. You need to turn the page to the entire world to find it. Here is Momchilgrad. Here's Brazil. Oh, they're taking Naim to the West then. Oh, my. Are you going by plane? Plane, ship, train... Whatever. From Momchilgrad... Forget about Momchilgrad. They've never before let anyone from Kardzali go abroad. Let alone to a non-socialist country. Brazil is not communist. But they're letting him go. Wow, man. Wow. Wow, bro. Can you go? It's so far. 1982 BRAZIL YOUTH WORLD WEIGHTLIFTING CHAMPIONSHIP 1982 SÃO PAULO Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to São Paulo and to the eighth Annual Youth World Weightlifting Championship. Easy. Lift it. Give it to me. Tall as a cypress tree. If this one can't receive the signals from Ankara... -Turn it on one more time. -One more time. -How do you know-- -Turn it on. -There! -There you go. Naim Suleymanov. He's at the eighth Youth World and Pan American Championship here in São Paulo, Brazil. This is the first international appearance for this young man of Turkish origin. You show them. The young athlete is trying a risky weight, 140 kilos. Come on. Naim weighs 52 kg. At his first international competition, he's going for almost triple his own weight. He's tough. Bravo! Bravo! Way to go, boy! Way to go! You did it. You did it! That was 140 kg, a young class world record. And he lifted 110 kg at the snatch. So, it's a total of 250 kg. That is a world record. Bravo, Naim. Bulgarian heroes! Bulgarian heroes! USSR WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP MOSCOW HEAVY WEIGHT He'll blow his hair now. That's right. One side is heavier. It's not equal. Coach? They put the single 5 kg on the right side. -Why didn't you inspect it properly? -Cut! -Why did they cut it? -It'll come back. What if he got hurt? Equal or not, the lift is valid regardless, Coach. Bravo. Point! Well done, boy! Bulgarian heroes! Bulgarian heroes! Dear Comrades, we are gathered here today to celebrate gold medalist Naim Suleymanov. Let's hear it for him, friends. You're the pride of the Republic of Bulgaria. Our government is presenting this Lada car to Comrade Naim as a gift for this great achievement. We're hoping that these great achievements will continue. I am proud to bring these gold medals to the Republic of Bulgaria. I feel the love and support of the Bulgarian people everywhere I go. THREE MONTHS LATER SOFIA BULGARIA'S RULING COMMUNIST PARTY PARLIAMENT SESSION The opening address of Comrade Todor Zhivkov at one of this country's congressional sessions, in 1970, is a historical event that still enlightens our path today. DECEMBER 26, 1984 THE DARK NIGHT Bulgaria is a one-nation state. Because of historical conditions, we have a Turkish minority living in our country. Following Comrade Zhivkov's orders, we are now commencing Operation Returning to the Roots targeting all Turks who live among us. Go back to your homes! Go back to your homes! As part of this assimilation campaign, schools will no longer have classes in the Turkish language, mosques will be closed down, Turkish newspapers will be closed down, and speaking Turkish will be banned in public places. Attack. MOMCHILGRAD - MOUNTAIN PATH MOMCHILGRAD - DOWNTOWN Let go! Stop it! Those in favor of the national liberation motion... Those opposed... Motion unanimously accepted. Firing positions! Fire! SOFIA SPORTS HOTEL Naim. Naim, get up. Your father is calling. He sounds bad. -Hello, Dad? -Naim, son... What happened, Dad? The situation is bad here. Bad things happened tonight. I can't talk about it on the phone. We are okay. Your mom and brother are at home, -and Muharrem is with me. -What happened? There are other people waiting to make a phone call. I have to hang up now. Go to sleep. I miss you, son. Good morning, Comrades. Today is December 27, and 1984 is almost over. Wheat production has increased by 15 percent this year. Good morning. With this increase, wheat has reached growth levels equal to our other leading field crops. Nothing on TV. Were you expecting something like a fool? TOWN HALL You're changing your name of your own free will. Pick any Bulgarian name you want from this list. We're not forcing you. ANASTASIA MIHAILOVA SEVERINOVA Naim is here, Esma. Is that Naim? Welcome, Naim. Naim! Welcome, son. Welcome. Naim, welcome. -You're our pride. -Did they make you walk here? Welcome. -You gave us strength. -Welcome, Naim. -My boy. -My son. I was a bit impatient, when you stepped on that platform... Welcome. Move away! Go on! What are you doing? Don't you have brains? We were told not to gather together, not even two, or three people! You wanna get him into trouble? You've kissed and hugged him enough. So get the hell out of here! Go on! Get! You're going to the tobacco harvest with your mom -tomorrow, right? -Yes. Stop by at your grandfather's grave on your way back. Okay? But make sure that no one's with you. Go on. Go on! OTETS PAISIY STREET RAYKO STILANOV SHALAMANOV ANASTASIA MIHAILOVA SEVERINOVA Naim? My son. Well... ALLI STILYANOV Who do you think did this, Naim? -You don't recognize me. -No. Sorry. What if I say Attorney Nevzat Kucuk? Nevzat "Little Bro" Kucuk. Little Bro, yeah. Now, tell me, who changed the names on the tombstones? -It must've been the police. -You're wrong. It's the Imam. The Imam? Why? The police told him, "If we change it, we might break some of them, find a couple of guys and deal with it yourself." He did it with tears in his eyes. Changed the names of the dead? This is treachery. It sure is. Let's go for a walk. First you will promise me that what we discuss today will remain between us. I promise. -Did you hear about the Belene camp? -Of course I did. They moved the people who refused to change their names there. There's more besides that. I spent five years in Belene. Belene is an island in the Danube River. It connects to the mainland via a single bridge. When you cross that bridge you enter a different world. After a while you forget that there's another world beyond that bridge. In fact, they try to make you believe that. You have to resist that. You must keep reminding yourself that outside this camp, outside this torture center, people are resisting like you, and that they will never forget you. We've always lived with this hope... -but I wonder if the world remembers us. -They fired upon women and children. They all died in vain. They died so they wouldn't have to change their names, and now their tombstones have Bulgarian names on them. Turkan, Suleyman, Mustafa, Rami, Nesim, İbrahim, Muammer, Aziz, Kemal, Zubeyde, Sefika. Their names are written in here, Naim. They won't be forgotten. When the time comes the whole world will know them. No one, not even in Sofia, has heard about what happened here. How could the whole world know? Everyone has a weapon, Naim. Some throw rocks, some write poems. I don't know what your power is. What you can do for these people, you'll find out on your own. 1985 MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA Alexander Varbanov, room number 438. Stefan Topurov, 423. Naim Suleymanov, and Dimcho Yordanov, room number 426. Am I not staying in a single room? -Dancho Kolev... -Come on. ...room 324. -Cheese! Hold still! Done! -Come on. Bulgaria National Team. Good luck. We're so happy to see you. Good luck. Good luck. -Good luck. -Hello. -I'm Basri. -Hi. -I'm a Bulgarian Turk. -Are there many Turkish in Australia? Of course there are. We're not alone. You're Naim Suleymanov, right? Yeah. We've heard that they're changing all Turkish names, -but-- -Right. -So much has happened. -Great that they haven't changed yours. Yeah, no, I guess they haven't yet since I'm attending tournaments abroad. They can't change it anyway. -The whole world knows your name. -Naim! -Then I'll see you around. -See ya. If you need anything... But we won't be seeing each other again. -Fate. -My wife and kids. -Hello. They're cute. -Thanks. See you. Let's go. -Naim. Hello, Naim. -Hi. I spoke to Basri. You met him at the park yesterday. -Yeah, we spoke. -We've been here for a long time. We're immigrants from Bulgaria. You're also from there. We watch you on TV. Medals, records. -We're so proud of you. -Thank you. We don't have much time. They'll be getting suspicious. That's why I'll ask you right away. Do you ever think of escaping? Keep walking. Do you ever think of escaping? Huh? Maybe to the West? Or to Turkey? Huh? Turkey would be so nice, right? You visit many different countries. Don't you ever think of escaping? Why not? You will definitely need people who can help you. We have many people here, Naim. Just so you know. Many people. If you ever decide to escape, just tell me. You're my fellow countryman. -You can trust me. -Not like this. We've just met. And which village are you from? -Sedefche. -Sedefche? Hello, my brother. That's Little Bro's village. You guys are making us Bulgarians proud. Keep up the good work. Little Bro's village. I wouldn't know what your power is. You'll find it on your own. It's nothing. Go back to sleep. Come on! Take it! This one is for you! Way to go, tiger. You've made us proud again. Thank you, bro. I spoke to my guys. They were so happy. -About what? -That you will be escaping. Brother, we should've talked about it first. How can we do this? I have no idea and-- If you've made up your mind, that's easy. I have spoken with many people since last night. I told them, "Naim will escape, be prepared." Everyone will do their part. I have family there. My mom is in Momchilgrad. And my dad and Muharrem... Naim, everyone involved in this has a family. Just tell me if you're in. What's wrong? -Scared? -Not for myself. -But this is so sudden. -Sudden? What do you mean? -We just met yesterday. -So what? Don't you ever discuss among yourselves a way to escape to Turkey? -We do. -Don't talk. Just do it. Here's your chance. We're talking about it. You don't become a hero by talking, Naim. Naim? Mustafa, Rami, Nesim, Muammer, Aziz, Kemal, Zubeyde, Sefika. Who are they? Did you hear about baby Turkan, brother? -I didn't. -She was only 18 months old. When Sofia sent the tanks, we lost nine people. You're my countryman, and you didn't hear about it. We don't receive the news. Kardzali is a forbidden zone. They require a separate visa. No reporter can get in or out of there. The news might not get out, but I could. If I speak, the whole world will hear. Now you're talking, man. Let's do it, bro. Okay. Wonderful! We have a meeting in 15 minutes. Abadjiev gives a speech. Then they read the schedule for the night. I'll learn the time and place for the celebratory dinner. Everyone will have their dinner in their rooms. Leaving the hotel is absolutely prohibited. What about the celebratory dinner? Why are we winning the medals if we're not going to celebrate? Dinner will be served in the rooms. The bar, lobby and the swimming pool are prohibited. Why are we winning then? Boys, to your rooms. Go on. What's going on? There was a tip. Intelligence is going down hard. Go on, faster. Have a nice trip. Congratulations. Bravo. Bravo! The World Championship is next year. We'll definitely do it next year. See you next year. See you all next year! -And then, we will have drinks. -Okay. See you all next year! NAIM'S HOME SOFIA Is that his house? It's very beautiful. Can you imagine what it would be like... Look how nice Naim's place is. -It's huge. -Yeah. Naim? Hello. You have a very nice place. Welcome. Go in. -Why the long face, champ? -No long face. It's just one room smaller than Zhivkov's Palace. You're right. Friends, Little Giant didn't like just getting a medal. He says, "Tell Zhivkov to give me his own palace next time." -We've laughed so hard. -And drank too much. No, please don't! Don't! Coach, we've received a letter for Naim. We need you alive. Go easy, don't kill yourself. -The target is Melbourne. -Naim. The Mayor of Kardzali is inviting you to a ceremony. You're excused for tomorrow. TOWN HALL - KARDZHALI We are saluting our special guest. You're the pride of Kardzali. We're proud of your achievements. Let's hear it for him. Now he's taking another step that will also make us all very proud. He's leaving his Turkish name behind and adopting his new name. Let's give Naum Shalamanov a round of applause. "Naum... Shalamanov"? Here you go. Another round of applause. ZORA Morning, Comrade. Morning. Training will start late today. Go on. Go on. Come on. Where are we going? -The party headquarters. -What are we going to do there? Speaking Turkish is prohibited, Comrade. First, I will give you a fine of five levs for that. Then I will drop you at the party HQ. This is the text that you will read. Let's start after you memorize it. -Will we do a recording? -Yes. Do you have a pen? For what? -There are some mistakes here. -Comrade... everything that's in the text is correct. These are not my words. Sit down, Comrade Shalamanov. Three, two, one, go. Two, one, go. It's normal... that I took... a Bulgarian name. The Bulgarian Communist Party, which rules the Republic of Bulgaria... has made me... has made me a champion. That's why I support the Bulgarian Communist Party. I love and care for our country, for Bulgaria. Don't answer it. I don't want to deal with the neighbors. You stay right here. BULGARIA PRESIDENT TODOR ZHIVKOV'S PALACE Comrade Zhivkov, Comrade Shalamanov. -Welcome, Shalamanov. -Thank you, Comrade Zhivkov. -How are you? Are you good? -I'm fine. Take a seat. I saw your speech on TV yesterday. I'm proud of you. I've heard you train eight hours a day. How can you take it, boy? Every athlete who has high goals should do the same. I have high goals too. Very high goals. Having high goals is good. You should know that our government will provide you with everything you need. You can be sure of that. A HEROIC SON OF SOCIALIST BULGARIA They're using you. Let them believe that. You asked me about my weapon, remember? I know what my weapon is now. The whole world will know what's going on here. Will your voice be loud enough? I've planned everything, man. -Listen-- -Don't! Don't. Never tell me, nor anyone, anything. Why did you want to meet? I need to learn something. Do you know Rasim from Sedefche? Yes. -How do you know Rasim? -I ran into him. I'll be off to Melbourne tomorrow, he'll help me there. I said, don't tell me, boy! I'll be careful. I'm not sure if being careful is enough. Your Naim came, and you made the chicken. Of course. My son is here. We only eat potatoes. But for Naim, you serve chicken. It's not easy to lift those weights. He must eat well. Then I should join the National Team too, Mom. -I will break all the records. -Can you imagine competing against him? -You can't beat him. -He can't beat me, Dad. -He'll eat you like chicken. -My big bro. Naim? I couldn't sleep, so I've decided to put my bag in the car. What's wrong with you, Naim? I'm fine, Mom. I was wrong then. There's a girl. A beautiful girl. She's getting into my head a little bit. It shows. I noticed that. When did you grow up? You've grown and you've gotten into big things. What did I get into, Mom? I just do my job. Go ahead. Godspeed. Go and come back safe and sound. Have a safe journey. You kiss them goodbye for me. I couldn't bring myself to do it. I couldn't say goodbye to them. It feels as if I'll come back here and play in the yard tomorrow. I miss you so much, Mom. My little lamb. My little lamb. My sweet boy. Don't you worry about us. Look, you have some heavy lifting to do. You eat well over there. Eat well. MELBOURNE, 1986 WORLD WEIGHTLIFTING CHAMPIONSHIP AUSTRALIA Here, we found them. Boys, grab your luggage. Let's meet at the reception area. -Good morning. -Good morning. We're here to bring an athlete to the embassy. Naum Shalamanov. Yes? You're coming to the embassy with us. -Where? -To the embassy. -Don't be scared. -Okay. Welcome, the hero of the Balkans! Hello. Welcome. Welcome. Welcome. EMBASSY OF THE REPUBLIC OF BULGARIA MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA You will stay here. But the entire team is at the hotel. You will be competing in two days. Go on, move, move. Bravo! Bravo! -Bravo! -Come here! Bravo, my boy! You will train and you will win. Keep going. Did he get it? Come on, let's go. Hand over your passport. Passport. Bulgarian heroes! Bulgarian heroes! Come on, all together! Bulgarian heroes! Bulgarian heroes! Bulgarian heroes! Bulgarian heroes! Bravo. Please accept this small gift. Thank you. Congrats. Congrats. Congrats. Congrats. Good night. Bulgarian heroes! They're not drinking, bro. Fill the glasses! Go out the back door. It's open. White car. Waiting for you. Bulgarian heroes! Why are you not drinking? Am I to drink with you? I'll call him now. Naim. Come here, boy. Hey! That's a shame, now. Come on! -These are our friends from Bulgaria. -You are a hero. I've been training him for a long time. I have to go now. Good night. Would you guys like some wine? -Please. Let's drink together. -No. -No. -No, thanks. A little. Just a sip. Come on. Naum! Naum has escaped! Run! Naim! Bro, move it! They're after me! Stop! They've kidnapped our athlete! The cops are coming. I knew they were going to cause trouble. Bro! Bro! Bro! -They're the spies. -We'll outrun them. Lights! The lights are red! Red! That was so close, bro. All right then. We're good for now. You'll move to the other car. Who are they? I don't know them. Patriot friends who live in Melbourne. Don't worry. They're from Turkey. This is the second year the Bulgarians have seen me around the team. They will find my home, my address. Everything. They saw the car too. We need to split up. Go on. Go. Where will they take me? -I don't know. -What do you mean? -You just said you've talked to them. -Naim, the cops will find me. It's better that I don't know. That's why we've agreed on this. Come on, Naim. Go. -Will I see you again, Brother Rasim? -Naim, come on. Go. Hi. Welcome to your country, Brother Naim. -Thanks, brother. -Don't worry, now. Nobody can take you without taking our lives first. I couldn't thank him. What? I couldn't thank Brother Rasim. You've caused an uproar, brother. The biggest thank you would be you getting to Turkey safe and sound. Normally this place is very quiet. The biggest fuss must be around that restaurant now. Let's pass through there, okay? Okay. Let's have our photo taken for a keepsake. -Ask the cops for autographs. -Don't start now, for God's sakes. Let's pass through there. What will you do at your house? Silence, and more silence. He's so small. How could he lift those weights? Ah, stop it... Hello. You're awake already, Brother Naim? Good morning. Just go to the guest room. I put breakfast on the large table. Thank you. Good morning, tiger. -Morning. -Morning. -Morning, Naim. -Go sit at the table. Did you sleep well? -Yes, brother. -Good. I've cooked eggs with tomato for you, to make you feel at home. We all like eggs this way. You'll be so good for our country, Brother Naim. He will, hopefully, he will. -Serve yourself, man. -Thank you very much. The Sofia team has departed immediately. Moscow is sending a special KGB unit. We will find him, Mr. Zhivkov. You losers! A bunch of losers! It would've been better if 500,000 Turks had escaped... instead of Naim. The boy seeks political asylum. Why can't you pick him up from here? That's what I'm asking. I don't get it. We can't send a private vehicle to pick up every refugee. Bring him to the embassy, and we'll process him. -You don't seem to understand me. -I do understand, sir. Everyone is looking for this boy. The Soviets, Bulgarians. Even the Australian police. How can I bring him to you? I'm trying to get to Turkey. You left Turkey. It's been six years. That's a long time. Why did you leave? So I wouldn't shoot my aunt's son. They've pitted brother against brother. They made everyone an enemy back in Turkey, Brother Naim. I hadn't seen him for a while. Then I ran into him on the street. I saw a gun on his waist. I had one too. One of us is a rightist. And the other is a leftist. Then there was the September 12 coup. I escaped from Turkey in November 1980. They broke the ones left behind very badly. So, Brother Naim, they officially changed your age for you to attend the Olympics? They did the same thing to a 17-year-old kid back in Turkey. So they could hang him. It's not happening. They can't send a vehicle. He must go to the Embassy by himself. -But how can he go outside? -How should I know? There's only one way. -We'll call Ankara. -Maybe we should call Arif from Belgium. Okay, everyone, take out your phone books. Let's see who we can contact. Officials, bureaucrats, reporters... Earlier today, I personally spoke with Mr. Zhivkov. He suggests that we accept the Soviet Intelligence's help without losing too much time with the red tape. The KGB is ready to assign field agents to the Naum Shalamanov case. It's not just Bulgaria's problem. Thank you. -He must be picked up, Mr. Nesim. -He can't go out on the streets here. -His picture is all over the TV. -Intelligence agencies are after him. Of course you didn't hear about it over there. -He's been with us for three days. -We've changed four houses already. -Everything will be over in two days. -We need a car with diplomatic plates. -A car with diplomatic plates. -We need immunity. DECEMBER 11, 1986 TURKISH NATIONAL ASSEMBLY MEETING Sir, Naim Suleymanoglu is in Australia. -We need to take care of it. -Naim? -In Australia? -Yes. Can. -Sir? -You need to take care of this. Yes, sir. -Naim. -Get up, brother. Get up. Get up, brother. It's time to leave. -My man, it's good news. -We took care of it, boy. Now, go to Turkey and put everyone's mind at ease. -Thank you. -Our country needs morale. Go on, tiger. -Thank you. -An official car came for you. You'll go in an official car. We'll go to the embassy first. You'll be our guest tonight. We are preparing your passport now. -You will fly to Ankara through London. -Thank you very much, Consul. The team that will meet you in London has already departed from Ankara. Darn it! -What happened? -Sister Ayse. -Sister Ayse? -She wasn't home when I left. I couldn't say goodbye to her. And I didn't thank her either. Damn! It's with sadness that I say Turkish terrorists have kidnapped our athlete. With the help of the Australian police, I'm sure we will find him... He has escaped! Naim has escaped! Naim has escaped! -What? He escaped? -Naim has escaped! He made it! Naim has escaped! He has escaped! Naim has escaped! Naim has escaped! -The weightlifter. -Naim has escaped! He made it! The weightlifter! Come here. They will take us to the police station for sure. They will interrogate us. -What will you say to them? -That he's been kidnapped. -Right. -It's impossible. Naim wouldn't do it. You won't say Naim! It's Naum. You will say Naum. Naum. If you say Naim, they'll beat the hell out of you. Don't forget your own names and your mother's name. Tell me. What's her name? -Anastasia. -Anastasia. -What's your name? -Ratko Stilanov. -Yours? -Mavric Stilanov. Hatice. I will never ever call you Anastasia. Hatice. MELBOURNE INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT AUSTRALIA The Bulgarian government claims that you've been kidnapped. The Australian police want to make sure you're leaving of your own accord. They'll question you, and then you'll be on your way. Gentlemen. He's asking whether you're going to Turkey of your own accord. Is there any threat? Is anybody forcing you to do this? In Kardzali, in all of Bulgaria as matter of fact, we're under a lot of pressure. They've changed our names. -Many people have died. -Enough. The Bulgarian government is not on trial here. Every time I get a medal, every time they stick a microphone in my face, I want to tell them about your persecution. That's why I'm going. -Speak Bulgarian. -You're hiding it. You don't let TVs in. I will tell them about it. I'm going there to defend the rights of two million Turks in Bulgaria. There are one million Turks in Bulgaria. Not two. That's something. Up until yesterday, you were saying there were no Turks. LONDON, ENGLAND HEATHROW AIRPORT, LONDON Welcome, Naim. I'm Ben Can Pulak. Welcome, Naim. Selim Egeli. We are the advisors to the Prime Minister. It's a pleasure. TURKISH REPUBLIC EMBASSY, LONDON Mr. Ambassador. Hello and welcome. -Welcome. -Hello. I am Rahmi Gumrukcuoglu. Republic of Turkey's London Ambassador. Here you're on Turkish soil. So, welcome to your homeland, Naim. Thank you. -Did you inform him? -We did, sir. -Patch me through now. -Yes, sir. Our prime minister would like to talk to you. Turgut Ozal? Yes. Our prime minister, Turgut Ozal. Please. Mr. Can. We need to be cautious. The English police warned us about an assassination attempt. The Bulgarian Intelligence are working with the KGB. Last year, the Bulgarian Secret Service made an umbrella-looking... Naim? -Do you need anything? -No. Okay. With guns looking like umbrellas, the Bulgarian Secret Service has recently killed two defectors. One of which actually took place here in London. Just two blocks away from here. By the subway exit. -Who are they? -Naim... I guess the airline leaked the information that you're here. So, everyone knows you're here at the embassy. Those are reporters outside. But the Bulgarian Intelligence is among them. And the KGB supports them. Naum Shalamanov is a traitor. His country has given him so much, and yet he decided to defect. "Because I'm a patriot, I have killed him of my own free will. I didn't receive any orders." "Because I'm a patriot, I've killed him of my own free will. I didn't receive any orders." -Mr. Ambassador. -Naim, come. Meet our chef, Saban Erdem. Naim, we have a plan to save you from the crowd outside. Chef Saban is your double. We'll dress him like you. We'll send out two cars first. Chef Saban will be in one of them. Hopefully when the reporters chase that car, we'll secretly take you to Heathrow in another car. Okay? What if Bulgarian spies target him? My dear Naim, I'd give my eye to protect you. If you don't give me that honor, I will haunt you forever. You just relax. Okay. Chef Saban, good luck. Wonderful, wonderful. Stay down, Naim. I'll let you know when we're near the tourist sights. There's an important issue. In order to reach Turkey, we need to cross Bulgarian or Greek airspace. It's obvious we can't cross Bulgarian airspace. If we enter Greek airspace, we need to report to them who we are and our intended destination. What if Greece allows us into their airspace... but then forces us to land? They might land the plane, take Naim and deport us. Capturing Naim would be diplomatic leverage for them. We need to speak with the Prime Minister. We will fly 45 minutes into Greek airspace. -And? -We can turn the transponder off and perform a blind flight. And what can the Greeks do? -They might not notice us. -Good. They might notice us, and force us to land. -What if we don't land? -There are two Greek F-4's patrolling constantly over the Aegean Sea for situations like this. We will fly blind. We're in Greek airspace. We've been informed that communication has been cut off, but they're landing in Ataturk at 12:30 p.m. Let's bring them here. -Have them land at Murted and be discreet. -Yes, sir. Naim, wouldn't you miss us? Do you want to go to Kardzali? Aren't you scared? What are you gonna do there all alone? This is your captain speaking. Mr. Naim Suleymanoglu, my friends who wish to say welcome to you are just outside your window. Mr. Naim Suleymanoglu, we, the Braves Fleet, in charge of your safety, are right beside you, and greeting you. Welcome to your country, to your homeland and the land of the Republic of Turkey. I am the fleet commander, Lt. Colonel Eren Bulbul. In about 35 minutes, we'll be delivering you to Ankara Murted Airport safe and sound. You will meet your fellow countrymen who are eagerly waiting to welcome you. GENCLIK PARK Now, dear members of the press, let's take a short break on the financial topics for now. I would like to introduce you to someone. Dad! Dad! Naim! Turn on the TV! -Naim. -Thank goodness. Naim, thank God. My Naim. My little lamb. Look at him. Look. Was the plane comfortable? I sent you my private jet. It was very comfortable. Okay, any questions? I would like to say something. At the end of 1984, in Bulgaria, they forced us Turks to change our names. He says they've changed their names. They closed down the mosques. They closed down the mosques. They wanted to make us forget we are Turks in a single year. -My boy! -My Naim. My little lamb. My little lamb. Way to go, boy. Look at my boy. I escaped so I could tell the world. Now I'm very happy to tell you all about it. I want everyone to hear. They've persecuted us. Wouldn't you miss us? What are you gonna do there all alone? Let's go to the hospital first and have you checked out. Then we'll go shopping for clothes and check out the weightlifting gym. Is there anything you want, Naim? What I told the reporters yesterday at the press conference. Has it spread? I'll have all the newspapers brought to you tonight. -Brother. -What? You know the alphabet is different. Someone will help me, right? Professor Yildiz Sunay with the Ankara University Bulgarian Philology department will teach you our alphabet. You'll check the newspapers together. -Okay, son? -Come on. GULHANE MILITARY MEDICAL ACADEMY This is where we train our team. To be honest, weightlifting is not a popular sport in our country. We're trying our best here. We need to improve these conditions. For the champion. It's in the headlines of five newspapers. Everyone is so happy about your arrival. See, they found it odd that Mr. Ozal was repeating what you were saying. They are saying, "Ozal translated Turkish into Turkish." -Was it in the foreign press? -Let's see. I don't speak German, but it seems not. It's not in the French newspapers either. Other newspapers... Looks like it's not. Are you okay? Turkey already knows what's going on in Bulgaria. I need the world to hear it, not just the Turkish newspapers. It's not easy, Naim. Because it was a press conference held in Turkey's capital with Turkish reporters. To achieve what you want, you need to make yourself heard in completely different places. Or else we'd only be speaking to ourselves. Little Bro. -Of course. -What? Our family friend. When I told him what I would do, he asked me, "Will your voice be loud enough?" Where should I speak so the whole world can hear me? As Turkish people, we've longed for sporting achievements for a long time. We haven't won a single Olympic gold medal since the '60s. Naim could change this. He won 17 gold medals at international tournaments. He also holds six world records. The only issue is that the International Weightlifting Federation has ruled he won't be able to compete in any international event for a year. One year. The Turkish weightlifting championship in Antalya is next. -We can attend any domestic tournament. -Just among us. Then what? Then Cardiff. Cardiff is within the timeframe. -Cardiff is small. Then? -There's the Seoul Olympics. The Olympics. In two years. Would that be enough for you? The Olympic Games are big enough. That would do. Yeah, but there's another issue there. Bulgaria has the right to veto you for three years. Naim, we'll do our best. This is how we train. The rest is up to you. Naum Shalamanov is a Bulgarian weightlifter. He's an athlete raised by our socialist system. I don't think he will succeed in Turkey. Dear viewers, as of today, Naim is cleared to compete in international tournaments representing Turkey. Destination Cardiff! CARDIFF EUROPEAN WEIGHTLIFTING CHAMPIONSHIP UNITED KINGDOM CARDIFF SPORTS COMPLEX HOTEL NATIONAL TEAM CAMP I keep thinking about what the Americans are offering upstairs. We need to keep our ears up there, Arif. Hello, Naim. Mr. Cannigan says the American Weightlifting Federation... -Has it started? -Yes. Let's hope for the best. We have a fantastic proposal for you. This is your new car. Housing is also considered. We will give you two houses. So you could live together with your family. We have brought something for you. One million dollars, cash. Additionally, a check for nine million dollars. All you have to do is defect to the United States and join the National Team. There will be sponsoring brands as well. It's all yours. We've taken every precaution. If you say yes, we'll take you to the embassy right away. We'll take care of everything. This is a very good proposal, but I can't accept it. I want to be the voice of the people who are persecuted in Bulgaria. I don't want to be the voice for these brands. I owe a debt. I'll make sure what happens in Bulgaria will be heard from the highest places. -What did he say? -Is he with us? Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a gold medal to win. -He said no. -Kudos to him. His feet don't reach the floor. But he's just turned down the American Dream. What else would he have to do? Let's go. I need to stretch. Let's go, tiger. -I'm two kilos over. Time for the sauna. -Let's go. I'll come with you. TURKEY Thank you. It's the world record. One hundred and eighty kilos! This is a world record! Naim Suleymanoglu has won three gold medals. TURKISH REPUBLIC WEIGHTLIFTING FEDERATION Mr. Arif. Mr. Korhan. Mr. Arif is here. You give the good news, Mr. Korhan. Welcome. Naim, are you all right? Are you okay? Hello, guys. -Mr. Korhan. -You tell them, Arif. Where is Naim? He's not been feeling well since this morning. What do you mean? I have his medicine. Please allow me. Naim. Naim. Olympic Games. Bulgaria withdrew their veto. It's a big surprise, Naim. Naim? Oh, man... Naim! Gosh! Call an ambulance! Naim! Naim! We need an ambulance. It's urgent. Dysentery is a very serious illness. And what Naim has is the worst kind. Naim's been training for the Seoul Olympic Games since he first arrived. He has dedicated himself to it. The Olympic Games are the pinnacle for any athlete. Mr. Ozal is also very keen on this. There's been a huge diplomatic battle to force Bulgaria to withdraw their veto. I'm sure you all have heard how much government funds we have spent on this. He was criticized harshly for this. Naim winning an Olympic gold medal today is very important for us all, and for our country. How can I say this? He doesn't have the energy to lift his arm, let alone the barbell. Deep breaths. Don't let it out. You're recovering very slowly. -Can I go? -You will die, Naim. I can't die. What do you mean you can't? If you leave, you die. It is rumored that doctors were brought from abroad to treat Naim, and his condition is severe. She said "severe." After falling ill, Suleymanoglu was brought to Gulhane Military Medical Academy... What hospital? I don't understand. Why did they take my boy to a hospital where nobody is allowed to enter? I have to get out. I haven't done anything yet. Seoul is not the last Olympic Games. Since Bulgaria gave the green light they've all been... They've all been eagerly waiting for today. What am I gonna do? Will I say, "Better luck next time" to my fellow people? No doctor will authorize your discharge from here, Naim. -Forget about it. -I'll sign it. What are you talking about? I'll sign a waiver releasing the hospital from any responsibility. I'll say I accept the risk of dying. Then they would allow me to go. BULGARIAN NATIONAL TEAM OLYMPIC TRAINING CAMP Did you hear about Naim? He's been in the hospital for a month. He can't possibly get in shape for the Olympics, even if he starts training today. Congratulations. THE MILITARY MEDICINE SCHOOL OF GÜLHANE -Mr. Naim, we wish you a speedy recovery. -Will you be able to resume training? -Look here for a moment. -How do you feel? -Where are we going? -I thought it'd be better if we took the main road. You're sick. You need to recover. I'm going home? No, let's go to the gym. -You're seriously being ridiculous, Naim. -Brother. -At least today-- -Brother! -Naim. -We have 34 days left. I don't like it one bit. But let's go. If we're doing this, -we need medical support here. -You're right, Arif. Up! One more time. Up! Sir! You scared us. Fifteen minutes. Excuse me? I need to train three times. At least for two hours each. -I can only do it for 15 minutes. -Two hours? I'm holding an ambulance ready at the door for you. You know that, right? -Brother. -Yes? Going home is not working out for me. Maybe we can put a in bed here. So I wouldn't need to go home. -You mean here? -Yes. And you will stay here for a month? A plain bed. In here or in the locker room. Are you crazy, Naim? -Please, brother. -Doctor? Lift! Lift! -Bravo! -Lift! -Lift! -Bravo! Lift! Hold it! Don't drop it! Bravo! Honey. Honey! Honey, I'm not feeling well. Hatice... give yourself strength. FIVE DAYS TO SEOUL OLYMPIC GAMES That's 160 kg. Go, Naim. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to South Korea, the land of peace, tranquility and freedom. We are proud to host all the people of the world in our capital city, Seoul. The Olympics are a unifying and universal event that brings the whole world together. The place where people prove themselves in the best possible way, with their physical and mental abilities. Today, September 17, 1988, we are honored to have the shadows of the Olympic Rings cast upon our country. This is the fourth day of the Olympic Games, and the weightlifting competition is about to start. Naim Suleymanoglu is expected to be on the podium this afternoon. The Bulgarians arrived before us, Arif. -They've already started warm-ups. -Yeah. Stefan, we are next. The Bulgarian National Team is putting Stefan Topurov against Naim. Topurov is in a higher weight class than Naim. However, to make sure their strongest athlete is facing Naim, the Bulgarian National Team has decided to change weights and put Topurov in the Olympic Games at the 60 kg weight class. Topurov is attempting 137.5 kilos. If he succeeds, he'll break the Olympic record. Topurov lifts it. Bravo! There you go! Bravo! Success for Topurov. This is an Olympic record. Now it's Naim's turn. He'll be attempting to lift 145 kilos. Naim, we're thinking it'd be better not to start with such a heavy weight, but try a lesser weight to guarantee a medal first. Let's not take this risk, son. I can't miss this chance. I have to be the biggest news that I can be. Every lift should be a record. With each record, my name is closer to the main headlines. And my voice heard from a higher place. -Trust me. -An entire nation trusts you. Naim, who we have embraced as a nation, will be representing Turkey in the Olympic Games for the first time. -Go, tiger. -Go get 'em, boy. He will be trying to get the Olympic gold medal, which we've failed to get for 20 years. -Come on, tiger! -There's Naim! Naim succeeds in front of billions, dear viewers. That is an Olympic record. Naim has earned our country an Olympic record on his first attempt. Topurov managed to hold his Olympic record... Concentrate. ...for only a few minutes. Topurov's turn. Hold! Hold! Topurov has failed, dear viewers. It's going great. Topurov couldn't lift it. You'll succeed on your third attempt. Naim is going for 150.5 kilos. If he succeeds, it will be a World Record. Come on, Naim! Naim! World Record! World Record! Naim Suleymanoglu breaks the snatch world record with 150.5 kilos, dear viewers. Congratulations, Naim. Topurov is ready for his third attempt. And... And... And he fails! Topurov failed. Brother, this is much bigger than Topurov. Naim Suleymanoglu, 152.5... What are you doing here? Did my son break the world record? You're up, you'll feel bad. Feel bad for what? That he won't be able to break his own record? Suleymanoglu is going for 152.5 kg... He's his own opponent, right? It doesn't matter if he lifts it or fails. My boy will win either way. That's right. Dear viewers, in Seoul, South Korea, a 21-year-old boy we love so much has broken two World Records in snatch, and one in clean and jerk. This would've made four world records including the grand total. But Naim says, "No, it's not enough. I will break another one." A mind-blowing number. It's 190 kilos! Naim Suleymanoglu is trying to lift three times his own weight plus ten kilos. Go get them, tiger. You go, Naim. You will lift it with your heart and with your soul. You will not think about anything else. Those who stand in the shadows won't have a shadow of their own, Naim. You have to stand in the sun to become a shadow yourself, so the people can gather in your shadow. Suleymanoglu is attempting to lift three times his own weight plus ten kilos. -May God help you. -May God help us all, brother. Go, tiger! Fifty-five million fans in the home country. Millions of Turks who live in Bulgaria and the rest of Europe. He's walking towards 190 kg to become their hope and their pride. Not only Turkey, but the entire world is focused on this unbelievable event at the Olympic Games. We're on the brink of greatness. Come on, Naim. Our prayers are with you. World record, 190 kg! Naim reaches an unbelievable peak. Thank you, Naim Suleymanoglu. This is Seoul! September 20, 1988. A historic day. We have witnessed history. The weight was 190 kg. And it was above a 60 kg boy. A historic record has been set. Naim has just turned the weightlifting world upside down. These are tears of joy. The world's greatest, Naim Suleymanoglu breaks the world record. Thank you, Naim. That's my boy! Naim, Naim, Naim... He's the world champion! He set the new world record! U.N. BUILDING NEW YORK, USA My name is Naim. And my last name is Suleymanoglu. You might lose everything you have in life. Your home. Your job. And even your loved ones. But the hardest thing you can lose in life is your identity. Two million Turks who live in Bulgaria were forced to change their names. They've been tortured and persecuted. All we ever wanted was to benefit from universal human rights like all the people in this world, and to live freely with our own identities in the land which we were born. If the Bulgarian Communist Party fails to provide that, they should let our people who live there return to their homeland, to Turkey. I am Naim Suleymanoglu. From this day forward, with each record I break, with each medal I win, I will scream, "Freedom, freedom, freedom!" I will do this not only for persecuted Turkish people, but for everyone whose rights have been taken away in Bulgaria. Even knowing that I will die one day for this, I will never silence my scream. When you mention holidays, it reminds me of my childhood. Since I was little, I've never been able to celebrate the holidays. Today, I would like to be together with my family. I hope to celebrate my third holiday period with my family now in 1989. JANUARY 1989 ISTANBUL ATATURK AIRPORT NAIM SULEYMANOGLU PASSED AWAY ON NOVEMBER 18, 2017. HIS LIFE MISSION WAS TO IMPROVE HIS PEOPLE'S LIVES IN BULGARIA AND HE LIFTED UNLIFTABLE LOADS AND PAID THE PRICE WITH HIS LIFE. HE WAS 50 YEARS OLD WHEN HE DIED. WE ARE GRATEFUL, POCKET HERCULES.
