Thank you. When I'm naughty my daddy always sends me up to my room. About six minutes later he comes up and he forgives me. I really need a stopwatch so that I can time him. Get off the floor, Megan! Come on you lot, up! Get down at once! Sit, come on now, get down! Sit, stay there, stay! Sit! Excuse me! Excuse me, is this the Portsmouth train? Well, it's about time! I promised and I'm not one to break my word. Only when I went to tell him it's as if he-- I'm sorry, is this the Portsmouth train? No, no, it's the express. It doesn't stop. Thank you. Thank you very much. Alright, settle down. This is the express it doesn't stop here. Where's Adam? How come nobody stopped him? I don't imagine that we have chocolate every hour of the day or night. Better not go too close. Do you have any water? Yes. Do you require plain water or mineral water? I got something in my eye. The express was going through, a piece of grit, I think. Then I should advise plain water in that case. Okay, plain water. Mineral water will not be necessary. Okay. There's a man I know lost the sight of one eye through gettin' grit in it. Oh. Do you want me to pull the lid down and have a look? No, no, it's okay. Here you are madam, here is your water. Apply the glass directly to the eye, that will wash it out. Oh, do not care for the state of the floor which can be mopped. I forgot this lot. Where'd you want it? Here. When he grabbed my arm like that, see, I didn't know what to do. Haven't you two had enough to eat? Better? I'm afraid not. Try blowing your nose and rubbing the other eye. Blowing my nose, huh? May I help you? - Let's see. - No, no. Please come over here. I'll be alright. Now please, look up. - Look up, slight again. - I can't. Look down. Now there it is. Now hold it perfectly, perfectly still. There. There, that's it. You may think that it's still there, but I assure you it's not. You're really very kind. Not at all. That's my train, goodbye. Bye. Well, I'm not giving him any more love, I tell ya. That man is so stupid, he couldn't find his way out of a phone booth. Bye. Bye, madam. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Thank you, miss. Goodnight, George. - Goodnight, Mrs. - Jesson. Hello. Hello, my love. Thank you, my dear. Two more victims of yesterday's-- Hello. Good girl, Jamie. Out you go, now. Out you go. In Jamie, come, come. I'm home! We heard you, we're in the play room! Who's winning? I am, that's why Alistair's cross. Did you buy me anything? We're only losing 'cause Ilse's got no idea of how to play! Alistair, don't be so rude! - It's quite true, Mrs. - Jesson, I have no idea at all. You're not bad, really, it's just that you can't serve. I've won! 21-15! Dad, did you know Jeffrey Barrowclough got a wart on his thumb? Nobody ever tells me anything, do they? Hello. - What's that you got, Daddy? - You always keep the really important information for your mother. - Alistair! - Don't make fun of it! Warts are a virus! Anyone could catch his warts if they shook hands with him. - And I'm telling you-- - Nonsense! It's bedtime! You can catch anything if you don't get a good night's sleep. Unless I do that the petrol won't flow into it. Now go up to bed, both of you, and I'll come up in a quarter of an hour to read you a story, Dominic. Right, now I want that and that. Come here. Come on, Ilse, just one more game! Hi, good day? Much as usual, tiring. We are shorthanded while Lucy Parfitt is on holiday. They asked me if I could do two days a week. Well, I hope you said you couldn't. Yes, I did say I couldn't. I got something in my eye at the railway station. Just as well, social work. It can suck you in, you know, like a drug. In your eye, where? At Winchester, not here. The express was going through, a piece of grit went in my eye. Ooh, that's painful. You alright? Yes. There was a very nice man in the refreshment room and he took it out. That could be very dangerous, you know. You can lose the sight of an eye by getting grit into it. You sure you're okay? I'd better go up to the boys. Mrs. Baxter! Oh, Mrs. Baxter. I'm sorry, I forgot to give you these. Now, what happens is, you've got to fill out this form here and then send it to 30 Devonshire Street and they'll send you back your cards. My name's Grace Smedley. Now, if you have any problems at all, ask them to phone me here at the CAB office and I'll sort it out for you. He didn't come home Friday night. That's payday. Yes. Saturday, he didn't come home. Sunday I never saw him. Excuse me, just one second. Excuse me. Just one second. Grace! Yes? I've got no food in the house, nothing. And no money at all? Nothing. It's Friday, he gives me my money. Friday night he gives me the money. If he hasn't been to the pub first. Does he often drink it up? He never drinks it all up, I do manage. Forgive me, Mrs. Gaines, but, has your husband ever left home before? He may have been away, not to say he left. The kettle. Oh, sorry! For long? No, never! Maybe a night. Maybe Friday night he might stay out if he'd been drinking that night. He might stay, like a weekend. Yes? A week he was once away, took up with some bit from Northampton come to see the wrestling. Well, his auntie May lives in Northampton. He's got connections there. And how did you manage during that week? I sold the furniture, lived off that. We got some more after that, I purchased. Perhaps it's just as well you've come to us this time. Would you like to go through that door, sir? Oh, thank you very much. Through here? Yes, that's right. You have how many children? Six. Six children. - The tea. - Thank you. Sorry about the interruptions. Here. Six children. With the baby. And you're how old? 28. About your age, miss. I'm 37. I think the first thing is money, don't you? We can think of what to do about your husband when we know if he's coming back or not. Oh, he'll be back. Can you go to the Social Security this afternoon? Yes. I'll talk to them first and tell them to expect you. Yes. This is the address. Here. Thank you. Some 800 years old and is part of the original one built. If we now look at the nave, it's the longest Gothic nave in the world. If we come round here we can see rather better the north side. Some people think that this is the-- Hello. Hello. Do you remember me? I took a bit of-- Piece of grit out of my eye. Sure. Of course I remember, it was only last week. Do you live in Winchester? No, no, I live in, may I sit down? Please do. I live in Basingstoke, I'm a doctor, but I have to pop in here once a week to, oh-- Would you like some of this? No? I come here once a week to the chest clinic. Sometimes some of my patients are there. They're a very sickly lot, my patients, I'm afraid. Well, think how much sicker they'd be if you weren't there. Well... What's that you're eating? Would you like some lunch? No, what is it? That's prosciutto, raw ham. How do you spell that? P-r-o-s-c-i-u-double t-o. Well, that's very kind of you, but I promised to have lunch with some of my colleagues in the hospital canteen. I expect it'll be meat and potatoes. Not something delicious like that. I came into town to do some shopping for one of my patients. Do you lunch here every day? Oh no, I'm like you. I come into Winchester once a week. My work is close by and if it's warm I like sitting out here during the lunch hour. But if it's raining I walk to the Georgian Dragon for a cheese salad and a glass of wine. What an exciting life you do lead. Well, I suppose I'd better be getting along. It was a pleasure to see you again. I enjoyed it. I daresay we'll meet at the refreshment room, won't we? You make it sound like an assignation. Do I? Well, I didn't mean to. Was it offensive? Of course not, I shall look forward to it. Goodbye, doctor? Harvey. Harvey. Goodbye. - Sorry. - Goodbye. I've lived in England for 17 years. My husband is English and my children, well, they're very English. I almost think of myself as English now. What do you call your children? Alistair and Dominic. You can't be more English than that. Actually, there's Scottish, you know, you should have said-- British. I don't go back to Italy. I have no close family there now. They're all dead. What happened? The war. Sorry. It was a long time ago. Would it be impertinent, would it be rude of me to ask how you came to marry an-- An Englishman? Yes. Well, because I loved him. We met at a time when I was very lonely. He was very uncertain, unsure of himself. Oh, he was, you know how long it takes Englishmen to grow up. Yes, indeed, I do. Have I offended you? No, not at all. It took me approximately 25 years to grow up myself, if indeed, it can be said that I've grown up now. Tell me more, go on. Nothing more to tell. Of course, there must be millions of things to tell. - No. - All kinds of things. Tell me, do you never go to Italy, not even for-- What did you say? You never go back to Italy, not even for holidays? No, no. My roots are here now. Ah. Shall we? Yes, of course. Very firm roots. Like a tree. England is a good country for trees. It's good soil. They grow well. Even exotic, foreign trees. Do you feel exotic and foreign? No. You seem exotic and foreign to me. I'm very happy here. I beg your pardon. Oh damn, I'm afraid that's my train. Perhaps we'll meet again. We're bound to. Yes. Perhaps we'll meet when you're eating that, uh-- Prosciutto. - Prosciutto. - Prosciutto, yes. Prosciutto, near the cathedral. If it's not raining. If, indeed, it is not raining. Goodbye. Goodbye. Well, her husband hasn't come back. He's been away for two weeks now. That's longer than he's ever been away before, except when he was with some woman. Yes. Six children. I talked to the school. The oldest boy's quite bright, rather sensitive. What does she want to happen? She wants him back, of course. She wants her husband back. I thought she'd be better off without him. Providing you can get her all the benefits she's entitled to. Of course, we can get her what she's entitled to, that's not the point. What is the point? The family is the point, the whole family. There are other important things, you know. I saw my doctor again today. Is anything the matter? Not our doctor. You remember the man I met in the refreshment room at Winchester station? Oh, the gentlemen who took the grit out of your eye. Yes. He's a doctor, is he? Uh-huh. Well, if you catch the same train you're bound to see each other. He doesn't, he lives in the opposite direction. He says he has a practice in, I can't remember where exactly. Well, if you let someone take a piece of grit out of your eye you've got a friend for life. You're bound to say hello and how are you. Yes, would you like that? Would I like what? If we asked him over for a meal. It was only a piece of grit. It wasn't a major surgical operation, was it? He seems quite nice, I think you'd like him. We could ask him and his wife over for dinner one evening. Oh, no! Why not? Because you hardly know him. I don't know him at all and his wife doesn't know either of us. You should only invite people to dinner who you were at school with or who you owe money to. We could ask someone with them. Je-- Jeremy and Pamela. Why don't you ask him to lunch? But you never eat lunch. Exactly. Graham, how hopeless you are. Yes, that's what you love about me, isn't it? Family, you take it for granted, darling, because you've always been part of one. But it's everything, really. You know I can't do any more of this, I'm going blind. Alistair, what are you doing up at this time? Oh, please let me see if Daddy's finished the undercarriage! Okay, then straight to bed or there'll be-- No television tomorrow! Dad! Alright, come on, I'll show you what I've done so far. I've done half, I'll have to leave it till tomorrow. Oh, it's great, Dad! Bed, shoo! Thanks, Dad! Goodnight, Dad. Goodnight. Graham? Okay, Anna, I'll go. I'm just on my way out. They should know we're closed between one and two. Hello, I'd like to see Mrs. Jesson. Well, yes, she is in, actually. Anna, it's for you. Hello. Doctor Harvey! Ciao, Anna! Ciao! I've come to take you to the Georgian Dragon for, um... Let's see now, what was it, cheese salad and a--? Glass of wine. Glass of wine. But it's not raining. Oh no, it looks very much as if it's going to thunder. Nonsense. Will you come? I said if it was raining I had one glass of wine and a cheese salad, not three glasses. Perhaps it's the sunny day. I'm quite intoxicated! Sounds wonderful. In memory of, oh! Well, I will now show you my formidable prowess. It's beautiful! I used to play rugby. Yes? Hmm, I don't play it anymore. Could you go to the mystery plays this afternoon? I have work to do. Well, I know, so do I. Could you get off somehow? Well, I haven't any appointments this afternoon. I suppose I could clear things up and get away early. Good. All hours, all hours this harvest is mine! Do you feel guilty at all? What? Do you feel guilty at all? No. I do. Why? Neglecting our work. Well, I worked this morning, so did you. What's wrong with a little relaxation? What on earth should we feel guilty about? As though... It doesn't matter. Yes, it does. Tell me. Well, anyone could have come in to see me this afternoon. Anyone needing help and I wasn't there. That's not what you meant. No. What did you mean? I don't know. A sort of instinct. As if we were running a risk deliberately. I am the voice crying in the wilderness! The path of righteousness I show! Look ye, forsake all wretchedness. I give baptism in pure water called the river of Jordan. My baptism is but signature of his baptism whose like is none. It's very late. Shall we go, please? Alright. Behold the lamb of God is this. John Baptist, my own good friend, that faithfully doth preach my will. My deepest thanks to thee I hand the law of God. That's strange. What are you thinking about? I was thinking of my childhood. We're a long way away. And confirm that sacrament that you shall be. A voice crying in the wilderness. Prepare ye, the way of the Lord and make his path straight. The fulfillment of the prophecy, I think it's Isaiah, I think. I think it was. Tell me, what makes you think of your childhood? Well, when I was a little girl it was the war, of course. We used to spend whole nights in the air raid shelter. But when my mother was asleep I'd creep out. There was a very, very high wall at the end of the garden. I'd stand on it and watch the rockets lighting up Naples. It was like fireworks, better than fireworks. It was almost as though the stars were falling to help the bombers. And soon there'd be, there'd be great plumes of fire from the burning buildings rising up to meet the falling stars. Very spectacular. I was always frightened. Frightened to stand there on the wall watching. And just then I thought, I had the same feeling about you and me. Something we shouldn't be doing. Something dangerous. Well, life is a very dangerous business. I mean, walking across the road is dangerous. What John the Baptist was about to do was extremely dangerous at the time. Perhaps they might take his head. Don't laugh at me. I'm not laughing at you. John the Baptist, so many Saint Johns. Saint John of the Cross. Saint Climacus. Saint John of Beverly. Of Capistrano. For now I pass forth into the wilderness. The Holy Ghost shall be my guide! Two? Thank you, yes put it on here. - Any help? - No, no, it's fine. Excuse me, please, excuse me. Thank you, excuse me. Can I help you? Yes, thank you. Very fattening. We starve tomorrow. You know, this is one of my-- Would you like one? I'll have a bite. One of my earliest passions I've never really got over it. I think I could live on fresh Bath buns. And no vitamins at all? Excuse me, please. I'd eat a lot of oranges. There's nothing wrong, you know. Of course, not. Playing truant for a day is not exactly a crime. You mustn't say that, it's very old-fashioned. Children say 'bunking off' nowadays. What, oh, playing truant is bunking off? - Bunking, yes. - Oh, I see. How very kind you are. You said that before. I thought perhaps you hadn't heard. Well, I had. It's Dr. Harvey. We can sit there. Oh, yes. You seem to be a great expert about the English. Bunking off, I never heard of that. Well, perhaps your children don't say that. You say you try to be very English. You don't seem very English to me. No, I don't try to be anything I'm not. My husband is a county solicitor, we live in a village, we have two sons. I do fit in, I enjoy it. My wife doesn't like the country. It's not her fault. She was born in London, grew up a Londoner. What is she like? My wife? Oh, she's small, fair, intelligent. And your husband, Graham is his name? Graham, yes. What's he like? He's very tall, brown hair, very kind, not emotional and he's very intelligent. You say that with a great deal of pride. Did I? Where did you go? What? Where have you been? You went away. I didn't mean to. It just seems so awkward. When we are almost strangers to be talking about such personal matters. It's one thing to close a window, it's quite another to slam it on my fingers. I'm sorry. It's awful. I didn't mean to be disagreeable. No, you couldn't be disagreeable. Tell me, how did you become a doctor? Oh, I don't know, family tradition, my father was a doctor. It was a question of ideals, I suppose. What ideals? Preventative medicine-- Sanitation, hygiene, diet? You seem to know a lot about it. A little bit. I have to know a little bit for the Advice Bureau. Of course, of course. Well, environmental pollution, that's my particular pigeon, that's my specialty, that's the thing I'm interested in. What do you mean? Dust, diseases of the lungs. I've actually written a paper on it for a British medical journal. I'm showing off now. Are you bored? No, no. On pneumoconiosis. Pneumoco? I knew you wouldn't get that, pneumoconiosis. Don't be alarmed, it's quite simple, really. It's the slow process of fibrosis in the lungs caused by the inhalation of minute particles of dust. And this, of course, is a marvelous place for studying such a phenomenon because they still mine chalk here, you see. You suddenly look much younger. I do? Almost like a little boy. Why'd you say that? I don't know. Yes, I do. Tell me. No, please go on, you were saying about the chalk. Yes, well it's not only chalk, you know. There's other forms of disease. Yes? There's the inhalation of coal dust, that's called anthracosis. Then there's steel dust. Yes, of course, steel. It's called chalicosis. And there's stone dust that's called, silicosis. There's your train. Yes. What's the matter? Nothing, nothing at all. You must run. And thank you, I've enjoyed this afternoon enormously. Shall I see you again? It's the other platform, isn't it? - You'll have to hurry. - Shall I see you again? - Don't worry-- - Shall I see you again? Yes, perhaps you and your wife could come over-- No, no, no, please, please. But I can't. I ask you most humbly. You must run. Next week? Next week. Thank you. Goodbye. You finished? I'm home! We can't come, we're playing a game! Well, you haven't passed yet, so you don't get your 200, off you go. Hi. Hello, you're late. Nine. I just missed the train. Ilse? Oh, she's upstairs, she's got a headache. Dolly Messiter rang, said she saw you at the mystery play this afternoon. She phoned to tell you that? No, I don't think so, something about a right of way. She was after a bit of free legal advice and dressed it up as a social call. That means I pay you, doesn't it? Right, yes. 90 pounds, please. 90? Give me 10. Six. One, two, three, four, five, six. Where do you want it? Oh, is that for sale? How much is it? How much is it there? 60 pounds. Do you want it? Do you want it? Yes. Off you go. Five and one. One, two, three, four, five and one. Come on, and one. Super tax, come on you've gotta dish out - 100 pounds to the bank. - Pay a hundred. Thank you, on you go. Two, five, six. That one's, who's got that one? Is that for sale? Anybody got it? What is it? It's yours, Dad. Oh, is it? Oh, yes, you owe me six pounds. I shall die rich, come on. Lucy? It's Anna Jesson. Lucy, my dear, I don't think I shall be able to come into the bureau next week. No, not on Wednesday. Perhaps I could manage another-- Yes, I know, it is very inconvenient. I'm very sorry about it, but really, my dear, it's going to be quite impossible for me to come in next Wednesday. I have to be here at home. Thank you. Thank you so much, Lucy. Collecting 200. Who's winning? I am. I've got a set of all red cards. I've got houses on them. But I'm winning. Okay, Alistair, off you go. I've gotta pay you 20. Six, ten. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine and 10. He's got more money than you have. Chance. Your husband's doing awfully well. Yes, he is, isn't he? Good shot! Four. Have you got to 50 yet? What? Oh, you haven't put it down. I'm sorry, what was it? - Four. - Four. Your husband scored a four. That's great! What are you up to? I'm a searchlight! In the daytime? You'd be better off being a signal man, wouldn't you? And all my tanks run to the tree. Go on, try and hit that one. Oh, you did, you amaze me. Supper's ready. Shall I call them from the garden? No, no I'll do it. Come in, boys, supper's ready! I bombed all his tanks! Did you see? Come here. Oh, mommy! I'm alright! Well, that was quite a battle. Who's gonna clear away after supper, you? Yes, but Alistair made all the mess. Then both you can. I wonder what is for supper, do you know? Hi. Silicosis. What? Anagram, silicosis. That gives me the rest of the quotation which is, 'love bade me welcome, yet my something drew back'. Four letters beginning with S, Henry Vaughn. Soul. Huh? Soul. Is it? Yes, it is, you're right. What or naught you do know? I've never even heard of that. Nor have I, it has to be soul, nothing else would fit. Love bade me welcome, yet my soul drew back. Do you think Alistair's too young for chess? Why? Oh, I don't know, my father gave me a set when I was about his age. And? Pristine. Well, you can never start chess too young, it's good training for the mind. You never play chess. I wasn't any good at it. That's 'cause I hated it. But then, Alistair's more like you, he's very analytical. He might be marvelous at it. Am I really very analytical? Harry Patterson was saying the other day he'd given his boy a set and he was an absolute wizard at it already. He's about the same age. Analytical. Makes me sound cold. I don't like that. I'm not cold. I just thought that you could get me a set on Wednesday when you go into town. But I... What? Well, I... I was not listening properly, I misunderstood. You are going into town on Wednesday, aren't you? Well, I thought of changing my day. Didn't I tell you? Yes, you probably did, I forgot. Anna, if it's a bore I'll get Miss Dulce to buy one out of petty cash. No, I'll get one on Wednesday. It's no trouble, I shall go in. I come to see Mrs. Jesson, that's who I always see. I'm afraid she's not in today. You're Mrs. Gaines, aren't you, did you make an appointment? She said I could come in any day if I was in trouble. Yes, that's right, you can, there's always somebody here to help you. Wednesday's Mrs. Jesson's day. Mrs. Jesson comes in on Wednesdays, I know that. Yes, I'm afraid she won't be in today, though. Excuse me. Citizen's Advice Bureau. Would you hold on a minute, please? She may be in at the end of the week. - Well, I'll come back. - But she's thinking of changing her day. You sure I can't help you? She'll be in tomorrow? She may be. I'll come back then. Hello, I'm sorry, yes. Oh, yes, we did. Yes, I do remember it actually. Yes, I'm sorry we've been so short-staffed. I'll come back. Yes, it's here, but the pamphlets. Yes, we'd be most interested. Hello. Excuse me. Oh, I'm sorry. What's that you're carrying? A chess set. Listen, I borrowed a car from a friend of mine called Stephen Earl. Shall we drive down to the coast and walk around? Yes, alright. Fine. What's happening here, I wonder? It looks like an accident. What are you doing? I may be of some help. You're going? Yes. I'm a doctor. Look at that! Five! Good, five. Six? I won that! You know what's happened, don't you? Yes, I do. We've fallen in love. You've known since last week, haven't you? Let's walk down to the harbor. Yes. You look very serious. I'm blushing like a silly school girl. Where are the boys? Oh, hello. They're in the house helping Ilse bake a cake. You got the sun. What? I said you got the sun. Well, I always take my lunch out by the cathedral if it's sunny. That must have been a long lunch. Well, it wasn't a long lunch at all! I don't take long lunches! Alright. I just said you got the sun, I'm sorry. I better go to the boys. I bought the chess set for Alistair. You can give it to him when you like. I'll get it, Ilse. I'll get it. Hello? Speaking. Oh, did she? What was the trouble, did she say? Yes, I see. Well, I'll come in tomorrow, I know where she lives. Yes. Thank you, Grace, I'll look after it. Goodnight. Come on, let's get the cards out. Alistair, Dominic, you have your homework to finish. Now please get on with it! Look, I want all this mess cleared up, Ilse. I'm sorry I snapped at you. Oh, that's alright. That was Grace Smedley from the CAB. Something came up after I left. Oh, yeah? Anything serious? I don't really know, it was Mrs. Gaines. - You remember. - There's a bowl on the chair. - I told you. - Be careful. Oh, yes, I know, the one whose husband left her. What's it doing on the chair? Yeah, it's probably nothing very much, but you never know. Let me do that, Ilse, it's okay. You can pour me a drink if you like. Okay. What would you like, sherry? Scotch. Did you leave the office early today? Well, I had to get the chess set. It was a suicide attempt. You didn't tell me she was ill. Well, they rang through Thursday and left a message in case you came in. - She took an overdose. - I'll go right away and see. The oldest boy who gave the alarm. She wouldn't attempt to hurt the baby. - Hello, Anna, how are you? - Fine, thank you. Sister? Yes? Should I wait? Give her a few more minutes. I knew where he was, you see. I'd been told. I come around to see you, but you wasn't there. No, I had to go out. So I thought, go around and see her, I thought. Her? His... The bit he took up with. Yeah, she knew who I was when she clapped eyes on me. We had a conversation. A bit of an argument. Is that how you, your face? No, that was Bill. He came back and found you? It all happened yesterday. I come around to the bureau to ask your advice, but you wasn't there. Sorry? I come around to the bureau to ask your advice, but you wasn't there. I know, I'm sorry. I hear you've been making yourself unpleasant, he says. And he gives me one across the face. Only Tommy tried to interfere. But, Tommy's only 11. It was stupid, stupid. Tommy trying to stop him beating me, he was bound to get a good hiding. And that's what depressed me, seeing Tommy cast down like that. And being depressed, I took these pills. The doctor gave them to me for depression and I thought, it's bound to do good. So, being in the state I was at the time, I took the lot. Want the radio on? I don't mind. Alright, please. Aren't you taking it all a bit seriously? It? - Yes, this Mrs. Gaines. - Mrs. Gaines. Is there anything that I can do to help, you know, legally? No, no. Graham? Have you ever been unfaithful? What? Unfaithful, anything like that? Well, what makes you ask? Curiosity. You've never asked before. Does that mean you have? Well, I think that's putting it a bit strongly. How would you put it? Damn it, you do pick your time, don't you? Well, you don't have to tell me. Well, it was ridiculous. It was a long time ago. I wanted to tell you about it then. Why didn't you? Because I just couldn't think how to put it. Simply would be best. Well, it was... It must have been about six years ago. You remember I went to that law society thing up in Leeds? Yeah, that's right, you took Miss Dulce. Yeah. Don't tell me you and Miss Dulce? Oh, come on. No, it's very suitable. She can't be a day more than 63-- Alright, don't be ridiculous. It was the last evening and the whole thing had been a great big bore and I wished I hadn't gone. Yeah, you told me so. But, well, we were sitting around eating and drinking and there was a chap who said that Leeds could be quite a swinging town if you knew where to go. Where did you go? Well, we started off in the saloon bar of the Gravedigger's Arms. Then we went to a very curious place called The Gay Huzzah, very odd people. And we lost a judge there, the only judge, we just lost him. After that we went to a strip club. It, well you know, not the sort of club where they have the strip pole, right. But there was a girl who did an amazing dance with a snake. These hostesses came in. And you went to meet one? Well, she said that the crowd doesn't actually pay her, she had to earn her rent and because she fancied me, she'd spoiled her chances with anyone else. You went to her place? Yes. You did? So what happened? What, what happened? Well, I'd sobered up a bit by then and, uh... I... I just didn't fancy her, that's all. So I went to the bathroom and I climbed out the window and I hurt my knee as well. Oh, Graham! How hopeless you are! I just can't manage. Sometimes I've lain there for hours waiting for someone to help me up. It's dangerous. Excuse me a minute. Dr. Harvey. Mrs. Jesson had to meet a client. She asked me to let you know if you dropped in. She would have left a message at the hospital, only she didn't know how to reach you. Would you mind if I left her a note? - No, please do. - Okay. Cigarette? No, thank you. Excuse me. She never tells me when she's not coming. And I don't like to complain because I'm afraid she might not come at all. And I know how difficult they are to get. Thank you. It is dangerous, you know. You've been there twice in the last five weeks. She couldn't possibly have suspected-- I didn't know how to get in touch with you. That's what she said. I didn't want to leave a message with Grace. I didn't know what to do. I told her that you were a friend of the family. And that you were tremendously helpful when we thought Alistair had a mastoid. Did he have a mastoid? The lies, the unnecessary lies. No, we just thought so. It was a boil behind the ear. If it were just a sordid little affair, what they call, 'a bit on the side every Wednesday afternoon'. Do you want that? No, but... I could bear it more easily. What I can't bear is feeling such happiness when I catch sight of you. Even though I know I'm not happy. I'm happy when I'm with you. When I'm not with you I live in a dream of you. Dominic, don't do that! It's wrong, Alec. You must see that. I can see the truth and I recognize it whether it's right or wrong. We're in love with each other, you know that. We both know that. Whether it goes any further, whether we ever get together, I don't know, but we're lovers. We hardly know each other. We know each other very well. I'm sorry if I upset you. It's much easier for me. Why? Well, it's perfectly obvious that Melanie and I are not in love with each other the way that you and Graham are. I mean, we live some sort, oh, it doesn't matter. It makes it a bit one-sided. That's my train, I must go. They want it. Next week? Yes. If, by some chance, you want to get in touch with me I'm in the hospital in the afternoons, but in the mornings I could give you my home telephone number if you want it. - No. - No? Alright. Goodbye, my love. Bye. Next week. Keep away from the edge of the platform. Stand clear! Could you turn that thing down, Alec? I can't concentrate. Oh, sorry. You're reviewing that book? When do I read for pleasure? What's it about? Hard to tell. There's a lot of sex of various kinds, but I don't think his heart's in that. He's just wanting to please the publisher. Corruption of the soul, mainly, I think that's what it's about. He's strong on that. He's strong on corruption of the soul? Against it. It's just sex? Hmm? I mean your book, is it just about sex? Don't people fall in love anymore or anything like that? I suppose in life they must do or the human race could hardly survive, which is a different matter. Yeah, I suppose they must do. Were we ever in love, do you think? Hard to say. Up to a point, we must have been. You accept the past tense very readily. What? I said, were we in love, do you think? And you said something like, up to a point we must have been. Being in love isn't a state that goes on. How could it? I don't know, but let's not talk about being in love, let's talk about love, loving. That's a state that could go on, should go on. Don't you think? If you want to put it that way. Well, how would you put it? Look, I don't want to get at you, but I do have a deadline on this review. Let's just say quote, love can cast out fear that, if giving grief now, it at least promises hope for the future, unquote. Will that do? Hope for the future, yes. I'm going to bed. I'll try not to be too long. Turn the music off. Would you please, dear? Just doing it. Goodnight. She's very beautiful. Yes. Anna-- I have to go back to the office. Must you? Mrs. Gaines is coming in. Oh. How is she? Very cheerful. Her husband has returned, Tommy's gone back to school, everything is fine, until the next time. Shall I walk you back? You'd better not. I suppose I'd better see my patients, too, otherwise there's no point in the Hippocratic oath. Anna? Yes? I... Yes? I'll see you in the refreshment room. Of course. It's quite near here, by the river, just around the corner. But I, it's not fair. Darling, fairness is not the point. But to present me with it with no warning. I didn't know until yesterday myself that the flat would be empty. I wanted to tell you at lunch, but I didn't have the courage. And somebody else's flat. Stephen won't be back until very late. Nobody need ever know. Here you are. Thank you very much. It's not just an anonymous room in a hotel. It's Stephen's flat, he's one of my oldest friends. You've told him? No, no, of course, not. It's so furtive, so cheap. Please, please darling, this is something neither of us has ever done before. We can't measure it against the values of our ordinary life. We can't use words like cheap and furtive. Why should we let it be so important? - But it is important! - We don't have to. It is important! If we were strong enough it wouldn't be-- What's strong about denying ourselves what we know to be real? Thank you. Every time I ride home on the train I'm holding you in my arms. Every second I'm away from you is agony. Every time there's a knock on the surgery door I think it might be you. You feel the same don't you, don't you? Yes. Then, is it strong to deny that? There's your train. I'm going to miss it. Don't. I'm going. I'm going to Stephen's flat. I shall wait for you there. I'll write the address down so you know where it is. Take it. I'll wait for you. I love you. Joann! Ilse? It's me. Is Graham back? No, no, no, would you tell him that something's come up and I'm going to be delayed? Well, I'm afraid I don't know how long I shall be. Well, I'll get back as soon as I can, okay? Okay, thank you. Thank you. It's not very cozy. Well, it's what they call a bachelor apartment. You know, the hallway, the living room and the bathroom and kitchen all lumped into the smallest possible space. If Stephen wants to entertain he generally-- Where is he, I'm sorry. Where is he? He generally takes people out. He's gone to some medical meeting in London, BMA or something. He won't be back till quite late. May I, shall I take your coat? Thank you. Would you like a drink? A strong drink, we seem to drink nothing but tea together. No, thank you. There's, um... There's something I have to tell you. Yes? I've been offered a job in Australia. You have? Yes, but I wouldn't dream of accepting it unless... Unless? It's at a place called Paradise Springs, they mine nickel there. Nickel's a very valuable commodity nowadays, indeed, all metals are. And where there's mines, as you know, there are dust, and where there's dust, there's disease. Anyway, they want me. They heard about my work in the hospital here and they asked me to go there. It'd be quite a jump from being a GP to a consultant, but the Australians are not that stuffy about that kind of thing as we are. I'm... I don't know, there are probably a lot of applicants. I'm probably the last on the list. You said you won't accept it unless? Unless you come with me. I'm not mad. Tell me I'm not mad. But we're still young, Anna. We can make a new life. Have a family. I know it's going to cause pain to others as well as to ourselves. Them, more than ourselves. But we could do it, Anna. If we really wanted to we could do it. How long have you known? About the job? Yes. Quite some time I have to give a decision soon, if only to call them and ask them to give me more time to decide. Does your wife know? No. When I first got the offer I thought, it's impossible, I can't accept it. And then in the last few days I thought, wait a second, I could accept it if Anna would come with me. I'm not asking you to say yes or no, give an answer now, perhaps never. Perhaps you might think it's just an affair, or a thing that will pass in a short time. I love you so much, Anna. Oh, darling. Alec? Stephen. I'll have to introduce you. No, I don't want that. But, I-- I don't want to be found here! Alright, you stay here and I'll take him into the living room and keep him there, occupy him. Wait for a bit and then go out through the front door. Alright? Hello, Stephen. Oh, there you are. I didn't expect you back so early. Oh, but... I've got rather a filthy cold, so I decided to miss the evening session. So I'd just go back home and drink a lot of whiskey and then go to bed. Has anybody phoned me? Oh, no. - Hmm, no? - No. I'll get that drink for you. - Scotch? - Yes, please, scotch. Sorry about all this mess I should have... I surprised you. You didn't draw the curtains. - Here's your drink. - Thank you. It's not what you think, not exactly. I'm not thinking-- I just... This is yours as well. But I do think you might have warned me. It's alright, Alec, I don't mind. I don't mind, we're both friends, both adults, both doctors, I don't mind. It's just that I think you should have warned me. Partly because it would have been good manners and partly because I should have taken care not to come back early, cold or no cold, and partly because I should have changed the sheets. Or, have you already? Have you done? She's, she's not still here I take it? I saw her go in sort of a state and a large whiskey is so convenient in. No, Stephen, she's not still here. One of the nurses, was it? Was it one of the nurses? She had a right to scamper off. I'd never be able to meet her eye doing rounds of the wards tomorrow. It isn't as sordid and squalid as you think, Stephen. May I? Oh, that as well? There. Thank you. By the way, you're still keeping my key, hmm? I'm sorry, but I can't promise to be away again for a while. No, I shan't need your key anymore. Sorry, I didn't explain. I'm sorry I might have embarrassed you. I just... Impossible to, it's impossible. Goodnight. Let's have some of this! Oh, you stupid! Could I have a brandy? Just closing. Could I have a brandy, please? Just... Yes, indeed, madam. I'm causing you a lot of trouble. They'll be expecting you at home. No, madam. My husband will not be worried. He'll have a longer lesson. He's studying for the certificate of education. My elder son is helping him. I'm sorry, I have no money. I'll pay you next time. Not to worry, take your time. Please, take your time. Thank God, I found you. I was bound to come back to the station. Yes, but I didn't know, you might have had a lift from somebody. How do you feel? Humiliated. Oh, don't be. Humiliated, I mean. It was like, I don't know, not even a farce. I felt like a prostitute, exposed. I suppose he laughed, didn't he? No, no he didn't. Didn't he ask questions? He assumed certain things, I assured him that he was mistaken. But he wasn't mistaken! Why didn't you admit that we were sick lovers with nowhere to go? I'm-- Using his flat like, like a brothel. Because it wasn't true. It was. Darling, when two people love each other as much as we do-- Oh, it isn't enough. Loving each other isn't enough, other things matter! Decency, self-respect. Darling. It all seemed so innocent to start with, meeting by the cathedral, having lunch. It was so innocent. It couldn't be dirty or furtive. It was like a dream of love. Yes. Well, we know the reality now. It is degrading. That's not the reality. What you're thinking is not the reality. The other was. Was? Is. Is now. Don't you remember in the flat when I asked you to come away with me and we talked about the pain that might be suffered by other people as well as ourselves? And we... Anna? Will you marry me? No. No. Then what are we going to do, Anna? What are we going to do? Go on seeing each other once a week-- No, we've gone past that. We must stop. I can't stop seeing you! We've got to. Can you be so strong? I've tried to stop seeing you. I've tried twice already. You must help. Alright. If I take that job in Australia. I shan't have much time, I'll be gone in a couple of months. I won't be able to come into the hospital, there won't be any time. But I must see you, I must see you. Tell me I can see you. Next week. Try and take the afternoon off, we'll go for a walk in the country. There won't be much privacy, but at least there'll be time. Oh, darling. Forgive me. Forgive you for what? For... Loving you, for taking a bit of grit out of your eyes. For making you miserable. There's my train. I'll see you to your train. No, please stay here. Alright. - Ciao, my darling. - Goodnight. Cold? A little bit. You think we'll see each other again? I don't know. You think I could write to you? No. I suppose time will wear away the pain of not seeing you again. Come. But, uh... The memory. The memory of you, the loving of you, time won't take that away. It would be easier to die. At this moment it would be easier to die. If you were dead you'd forget me. I want to be remembered. When we first met, what was it you were eating outside the cathedral? Anything is possible. What strange twist of fate brought us together. Hope for the future. Possibly, a love that we can't have missed. I don't really feel like tea. Alright, I'll take you to your train, I'll miss mine. No, I'll come over to your platform with you. Anna! Hello! Oh, hello, Dolly. I wondered if I'd see you, I know it's your day. Yes, it is. Come in for a cup, we've just got time. Unless, uh? Mrs. Messiter, Dr. Harvey. How do you do? Hello. I'll get your tea. I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt anything. You're not interrupting anything. Very handsome man. He's a doctor, he comes into the hospital once a week. Oh, did Graham tell you? That I thought I saw you the other week at the mystery plays? Yes, he did tell me. And I said to Sandy that evening-- There you are. That it's time we had Graham and Anna over for dinner. It must be our turn. I mean, it's ridiculous to live so close and never see each other. No, it's our turn. Anna, you are looking so well. Wish I could. Don't you think she's looking well, Dr. Harvey? Oh yes, looking very well. You see, it's all tension with me. I'm tremendously tense. Especially in public, I don't know why. I've tried yogurt and I've tried yoga. None of them do any good. You know, my husband says that if I don't relax I'm going to end up crippled with arthritis. There's your train. Yes, I'm afraid I must leave. Yes, you must. Oh, aren't you coming with us? No, I'm a GP, I practice in Basingstoke, and so I go in exactly the opposite direction. Uh-huh. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. He'll have to run. He's got to get right over to the other platform. Where did you meet him? I got something in my eye one day and he took it out. My dear, how romantic! Oh, you see, I'm always getting things in my eye and nobody the least bit attractive ever paid the faintest attention. You know, I reckon-- Sorry? It's something in that Advice Bureau. You meet so many fascinating people. I never meet anybody. I suppose that's why I'm so neurotic. You know, Sandy says to me, why don't you get out more? But, oh, I don't know. What's the point of going out? Excuse me. You alright, Miss? I just got dizzy for a moment, I'll be alright. Here you are, I wondered what had happened to you. It was so stuffy in there. We'd better hurry, our train's in. Tell you who I saw again this afternoon. Looking rather a fright, I thought. You remember that hairdresser that you and I both went to and neither of us liked him? I thought his name was Elizabeth something other other. Come away from that window! Well, the other day I thought I saw him. But his right of way straight through the orchard. Well, I mean, it isn't really an orchard. Five dead apples trees don't really make an orchard, do they? But it's ours. I lie awake at night, I really do, thinking about it and worrying about it. Sandy says, take one of your pills. I don't know, one can't become a slave to pills, can one? Oh look, I do love to see the wild ponies, don't you? What a shame so many of them have to be killed. Well, Sandy said, take one of your pills. I don't know, one can't become a slave to one's pills. I take too many as it is. Last Sunday there was this couple with rucksacks. Something to do with the rambler's association. When I saw them here I said, this is private property. Oh no, it's not, they said. This is a right of way and we are re-opening it. Mrs. Marshall's cat is going to have kittens. Can we have one? I tried to tell them they cannot have a cat and also keep hamsters. You can if you keep them apart. We will think about it. You're a long way away. What? I said you've been a long way away. I have. I'm glad you're back. Is it for good? It is for good, Graham.
