Tenth Episode: The Triumph of Love Night had fallen. "Farewell, Father. Forgive me!" For Madame Villandrit, to be opened after my death. Rudeberg. "But how am I to die?" "Return to your rooms! You need rest, so you can prepare for tomorrow's ceremony." The sun rose, dazzling, bringing to each their share of pain or joy. "Yes, yes, it's me. You must call the doctor immediately... Rudeberg has just committed suicide." "My last chance for salvation has vanished. Rudeberg has just died." "Pascal was not there." "I am shattered with exhaustion." Dr. Harrier was driving to Basses-Bruyeres to confirm the death of Rudeberg. Greeting Mr. Dubois, he alluded to the drama which had just transpired. "So Rudeberg is dead?" "In that case, could you wait for me a moment? I need to go there myself." "Would you please give this letter to my mother?" "Well, then! Only one thing remains for me to do... surrender to the authorities." One day, near the old mill, we vowed, Pascal and I, that the day of my wedding to Corradin would be the last day of our lives. The hour has come to fulfill our solemn oath. "You see... I have come." "I never doubted you." "You have thus verified his death!" "Monsieur Dubois, the notary, wishes to have a word with Madame about an urgent matter." I ask Madame Villandrit to open this letter after my death. Rudeberg. I committed a wrong that I did not have the courage to set right while still alive. I beg Madame Villandrit to forgive me and not to allow the blame for my fault to hang like a shadow over my beloved Pascal, that my child might remain entirely ignorant of his father's shameful deed. I allowed an innocent man to stand accused of the murder of Marjory. I allowed him to be condemned. "Yes, yes, I assure you! Monsieur Julien Villandrit is in the house." "Friends, an escaped convict is at this very moment inside this house. Over a long period of time, he has successfully deceived us, by changing his name and appearance. Here he is, unmasked at last. The man who murdered Marjory... Julien Villandrit." "We will have our laws respected. We will turn him over to the authorities." In order to find it, it is necessary to go to the hiding place in Corradin's room. "I am going to give you one last chance. Disappear. I will calm the workers outside. And have Christiane prepare for our wedding." "Go ahead, sir. Do the job... you've honed your skills... and denounce me!" "Get me the Court of Justice, the prosecuting magistrate." "Yes, yes, it is l... Julien Villandrit." "I am waiting for you and I will prove that Corradin is the murderer of Marjory." "What do you want of me?" "To the prison. Murderer! To the penitentiary." "Yes, send the murderer to prison. But I'm not the man you want. The murderer is among you." "And where is the proof?" "Do you want the proof?" The proof of his innocence is in the enclosed diagram. No one would ever look where I have hidden it. Go to the hiding place in Corradin's room. Behind the armoire is a place marked with red pencil... lift the wallpaper and remove two bricks. The confession is in this small hiding place in the murderer's own room... Corradin's. Rudeberg. "Seize him!" The authorities en route to Basses-Bruyeres. "Here is the proof!" "Hold him while we wait for the prosecutor and the judge." I admit that I am the perpetrator of Marjory's murder, which was witnessed by the woodcutter, Rudeberg, unbeknownst to me, and I certify the absolute authenticity of the two photographs of the murder which he was able to photograph by chance. Henri Corradin. "I must do this, so that our child can have a life!" "Corradin... he called us this morning to denounce your presence here. Very soon after, you called us yourself, to surrender, and to accuse him of the murder for which you were sentenced." "You have proof of your innocence?" "What are you waiting for, Mr. Villandrit?" "I will read you his admission of guilt." "I admit that I am the perpetrator of Marjory's murder, which was witnessed by the woodcutter, Rudeberg, unbeknownst to me, and I certify the absolute authenticity of the two photographs of the murder which he was able to photograph by chance. Henri Corradin." "Corradin, that gesture amounts to an admission of guilt." "Henri, I never gave you the least cause to complain. Yet you repaid me by ruining the life of my wife and daughter. I have now taken my revenge. Look!" "No proof! I take back what I said. I never... no, no. Ah! I have given myself away." "My darlings, we are free!" In spite of all human effort, the great river of life always seeks to return to its normal course. The End
