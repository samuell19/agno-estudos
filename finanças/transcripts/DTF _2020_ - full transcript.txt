Right, here he is. Yo, yo, yo. Good flight, mate? So you got this date lined up or what? Probably dreaming a bit that we're going to find love, but we're certainly not going to find anything if I've got a camera spying in on your date. It's just literally going to be asking how it's going every... Yeah, I don't think that's possible to be honest. What do you reckon? You alright putting the airline badge on camera for you, yeah? You've hidden it already? So, so this would be the regular occurrence? You'd come and start swiping even though you've already organized a date? Is that how it's working? Do you just use Tinder? The idea is obviously to find you a life partner, and you're wearing that shirt. Well, that's... I was going to ask that question. Is there that thing or? Come on then, let's go and get changed. Fingers crossed this works. - We want to be part of it. - We're following an airline pilot - looking for love on Tinder. - Love on Tinder? - No, I'm not, no. - 'Cause I haven't found love on any website, so I don't trust any of them. None of them. You're looking for love in the wrong places. Who we trying to find love? He's in the bar on a date now. - Well let's go. - Yeah, let's go find him. Let's go help him find love. - Let's help him find... - You think he can handle this though? How old is he? He's, um, nearly 40. He's Scandinavian. Have you not heard the horror stories? You have him in there on Tinder, did you not hear all the horror stories on Tinder? - There's a few. - Come on, guys. There's like a lot of horror stories. There's even one about the like crabs. Crabs? You having a chat? No, no, we'll definitely be coming over to chat. So we've just been talking about Tinder with some girls. Yeah, so. I'll leave you to it. So far so good? So, as you can see it's actually gone dark and it's gone a bit cold, and we're still waiting around, and they still seem to be enjoying themselves. Shall we go over and talk to her or? I dunno. She said she wasn't that keen on talking, I think, but she's swiping right on Tinder, she sat swiping. We're feeling quite weird, yeah. How many beers have you already had by the way? Fuck sake. The arm, the arms across. I'm obviously not used to, um, just following a couple around. Are you coming back with us or? I know, we are, we're just going to go back now, we maybe thought we'd just turn it back on. Right, okay. That's cool. Nice to meet you anyway. He's romanced her. Morning, how you doing? What do you reckon then, reckon we... Come on, though, we don't have to have them on obviously. Right okay, shoot from a distance, yeah? Yeah. What she literally said like-? Can I, I don't know your code man. Right, sweet man. I'm surprised you're not completely hungover to be quite honest, but- I'm liking it, good start, good start. Way, did it again! She was obviously a little bit hesitant last night as well but, he obviously likes her 'cause he's making the effort. They look happy enough. Happy couple, we cracked it. Tinder has found love. Still talking, they've not walked off into the sunset as yet. What's going on? He's going to tell us to piss off here I reckon, 'cause she doesn't want cameras. Which is fine, that's cool. If that's the case. You alright, mate? Let me guess, she doesn't want the cameras. We'll do one if you want. What the fuck? Where are you going? That's why I'm ringing you, mate. Well I've just been on the laptop for the last few hours. Seems like she was involved in some... It's fucking ridiculous this, mate, this madness. She was involved in some porn scandal a fair few years ago. - Umm. - Right okay. I don't know where to go with this. Obviously I'm coming at it from not only the documentary angle, but also from a personal angle. I mean he's obviously not going to speak to camera at the minute. Yeah, I mean obviously I can, I'll try to speak to him tomorrow. I think in terms of, if you're thinking about investment, then I mean, I've been obviously thinking about this all day pretty much now. Umm, if we want to, even try and set up some interview with Tinder. I know you've spoke to them. Pretty much what we expected so we literally couldn't get past the security guard. We needed the appointment. I mentioned the girl's name. We have to take the stance of asking them pretty much what their take is, their responsibility in terms of things like this. We're just waiting on to kind of get tested but we've come to the agreement that this is a bit of a hiatus really. We're still going to follow him for now, but he's basically not going to be meeting any girls off Tinder or anything like that for obvious reasons. So, to be honest this is just an exercise of going and having a little bit of fun with him. I used to do like sex tours all the time, now I do more like craft beer and like street tacos. So apparently these are called Wankers for culture gurus. Classic, yeah. Well, all these have had a wanker. - So do people use Tinder in Tijuana? - Yeah. - They do? - Yeah, I actually just deleted it last week. Right okay. What's your experience of it? Yeah, I met my ex-girlfriend from five years ago through there. - Really? - And she was a model, she was like, I can't believe we dated. I use Instagram to get dates more than Tinder or... We're not using Tinder though at the moment. Hey, hey! Best boys, best boys. You know what we talked about, man. - Let's get a beer. - Yeah. Alright, cameras down for a second, and they agreed that they're going to - let us film in a corner. - Okay, yeah, yeah. And then maybe like one of the girls will... I think the fact that people can get anything they want, you know, at their fingertips. It's sort of taking the mystique of when you find someone special 'cause you go, "Well like, yeah they're special, but there's another special person." I want to talk about more of the responsibility of being a pilot and what you... Okay. Obviously when you're away on this downtime that we're following you on. What about the drinking? How can you explain that in terms of you go out, and you're getting smashed out your face and then you're flying back and... But again that doesn't, well- But that's reckless and you're in a job that, you make a mistake, you obviously make more mistakes... It's baffling that you've almost got two personalities, in a sense that, the consummate professional... So you're saying the culture has turned you into this? So you're actually blaming the profession? Whether you're single or married or? Well, I've got to be honest I'm seeing a different that the one I know. Right okay, I think we've probably taken it as far as we can in terms of... I don't... To be honest I don't know why, every time we talk, you have to take it to that level. Sorry, I'm Al, the director. So we're following this young man. - Hi. - We'll try and stay away from- I really enjoy just sort of sitting, but at a really sort of busy junction sometimes and watch people, you know. Yeah. Do you like, do you think you like doing that or? There's a minibus that goes up there. I don't like getting... I do but not when I'm working. How's it going so far? - This is weird. - It's alright. You're a charmer. We've not seen this side of him yet. So if you want, I'll just leave you basically like I said, and we'll catch up after you've been- well, what you're doing? Yeah, that's what we said. - And then food? - Yeah. Nothing too cliched then? Yeah, yep. I'm OK. Right, I'll leave you to it again. I feel like Cilla Black. This just seems like he's doing this to torture you. Have a good time. Have a good time. He's not even looked back at us. Brilliant. Do you want to, how'd it go, alright? We may as well get the nice view in when I'm going to ask you about your date. Okay, yes. - Any good? - Mhm. Yeah. - Getting on alright? - Yeah. Am I like asking too many questions already? Okay. Okay, we'll give it... We'll meet you back at the ferry, yeah? There we go. I didn't really ask them any questions. So how did the date go? It's all finished now. Restaurant, cinema. Any more? Funny you should say that actually. What we've been doing is we've been dancing. We've actually been, look at this. Hare Krishna. It cost me seven quid but it was good, man. So we're all good, yeah? Good date? Seems like a winner. Yeah, we're good with that. Happy? We'll catch up later on. I was going to say see what you really think then, that sounds terrible. Yeah, yeah we'll leave you be. Okay cool, leave them again. - Don't you like it? - No. I reckon that went pretty well. Arm in arm. It might be job done in Hong Kong, boys. He's saying "see you" to her now. Ah, it's a little... that was a real kissy kiss kiss. It wasn't a romantic kiss, was it really? You reckon? That was a gentleman kiss. Yeah? Come on, cheer up. So do you want to talk to camera about how you feel or? No? Sure? How you feeling? Talk in the morning, yeah? I'll give you a bell in the morning. We'll do a speaker phone in the morning if you don't want to talk now. Where are you, man? What? Why? Well, where are you now? What? Right, but where are you? Right okay, where are you? Up the tram? What's that mean? Up the fucking top of the mountain thing? Right are you waiting there for us? Right, not just me yeah. Right, so when we get up there, just stay back, yeah. He's there, just stay, just stay in behind here. Stay behind there, Rob. So, it looks like the date from last night has thrown him a little bit. Obviously we were really chuffed that he'd got on with the girl, but I think it's brought back memories of Charlotte and obviously this has happened. He's got pissed after we left him and he's ended up like this so... He wants the end of it here. We'll just get him back to the hotel. Get something to eat, get him to bed and then home in the morning. Quite a few of the matches. Got chatting, getting to know these women and then they'd ask, "What's your background," and blah de blah. So I'd say I was a widow and where are half of them? You just didn't hear from them. The captain speaking. Taking the piss out of us on here as well. Yeah, so San Diego, see you there hopefully. Bullshit. Let's have a look then. So obviously we're covering this documentary on. Looking for love on Tinder around the world. What's your experience of using the app? I think it's easy to build a story in your head either positive or negative before you meet the person. And a lot of times on paper it might be a good match, but when you meet in person there's not a spark or a chemistry, and I think when I meet someone in person, sometimes they may not be quote, unquote my type. But I'm more likely to date that person because there's a feeling there. I've said it a million times before but, I feel like David Attenborough. This whole not encroaching on the dates ain't half boring anyway. Stood here for about God knows how long now. Fucking hell, we've been stood here that's probably why. Loitering around for close to four hours. I mean she's going to be absolutely paralytic. I don't know where he's taking us, but I'm starting to get a bit worried. Anyway, he's still not getting back to me on the text, so fuck him. So apparently he's at the Hard Rock on the roof end they dick I you. He's obviously fucking absolutely smashed, but the worrying thing is, to be honest, is he's driven. Let's get you fucking out of here. No one wants to see this. We're going to get an Uber. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Are you fucked? Yeah, you alright? You don't fucking look alright. You're better standing up, mate. I think we're a long way from. I still want to do it, I think there's still something interesting here. But you've just got to be aware it's a completely different documentary now. Completely different subject matter in my opinion, you know, what we might craft out of this. But you've got to be aware what we might craft out of this, isn't what, you know the whole objective of finding love it's becoming apparent that it could be absolute bullshit. And I'm sure there are people out there. I'd probably like to find those people at some point to try and get the other side of it, get a bit of a more balanced documentary, but at the minute. You know full well what we've got. That's my other issue I don't. Yeah, obviously. You feeling better? But seriously and all, you know, this can't happen again. This is last chance saloon, mate. Dickhead, oh fuck it. Can't lie, mate, I... could do with a bit of sleep, to be honest. Wish it was mine, what about money? Well no, not for you. This money and documentary is becoming mine, so just so we know that. When do you get some sleep actually? That's quite interesting in terms of... This is really reassuring me with my fear of flying. This makes me not want to fly back. Can you get a boat? - So meeting this date? - Yeah. And then? Where is he? I can't believe it's raining. Here he is. I don't know whether they're going to be able to. So where's this Tinder date? I dunno, the one you're supposed to be meeting? We've been stood here an hour, we've still not... It's raining, what's the plan? We're not finding you a girl? So what you trying to say? Yeah all right, lead the way. Say cheers to the camera. Come on then, cheers to finding love. Cheers. To finding love. Why would you say that? Yeah, we've got an airline pilot somewhere that's looking for love on Tinder, there he is. Right, he's coming over. What the fuck is that? Nah, come on, no. No, man. It's not fucking Ayia Napa uncovered, mate, what the fuck. Come on. I'll do it to you. We ain't finding any future wife here. She told you to fuck off, I'm not surprised, mate. Call it a night tonight. We're all a bit knackered, mate. I really want to go to bed now. All what? Nice racially torn fucking joke there but, yeah. What about some food, you want some food? Definitely not going to this strip club then. That's 100 % guaranteed. There you go. Right we're going to bed then yeah? Alright, dickhead. You do what you want yeah? So what the hell, what are we doing here, mate? What the fucking hell's Nanny day? You serious? You think that's fucking normal? Right, go on yeah, come on. I'm not even sure, should we cover this? Shall we do it? Should we do it? You want me to follow him? Come on then, yeah. I'm not understanding the Nanny Day reference though, I mean? So you're basically a sexual predator on a fucking Sunday in Hong Kong. Is that what you're kind of saying? Well this is maybe where you want to use Tinder rather than doing this deprived shit. Well the point is we're supposed to be using Tinder, mate not trying to... Well, I'm not comfortable with you fucking picking on... Fuck nah, fuck it. Keep fucking rolling, whatever, man. I don't want any part in this to be honest, mate. No, well you can go back to Wan Chai, but yeah. The ridiculousness of this morning is... We can't not reference it and I think when we were trying to speak to the pilots last night, we couldn't get any of them on camera, but it seems to be a problem in terms of... I want to say the industry, really, in terms of this sexual addiction and why they do it. I mean I... What do you say to what we've just seen? Fucking hell, he's coming over now, here you go. I almost want to go in there and talk to the girls that, but again it's not, it's not the documentary. I'm really at a loss with where I want to take this now. Now this has turned into not finding love on Tinder. It's basically... You've got some kind of addiction and it needs addressing. I think your pilot should look on eHarmony. Yeah. - Or my daughter. - Or your daughter. She's a flight attendant, she'd get it, you know? So I think maybe flight attendants, I don't know this for a fact, but maybe flight attendants won't date pilots because they have a love in every port, I hear. That's what we're finding out, yeah. Right, so maybe he won't find love until he retires. Barely hear this. Hello. Mate where are you? We've been driving around arrivals about four times. Say again. You're on the way to Palm Springs? Why on Earth Palm Springs? Yeah you've said that but what's. So we're going all the way there. Have you got anything lined up? Right, well send us all the details, mate. Yeah, yeah, see you in a bit, bye, bye. What the fuck? Yeah, cheers for that. You've got company already. Tinder date? Right okay, going to introduce us? Hi, you alright? So Neil wants you to go to the Zoo. He's pissed off 'cause he organized all that so. Alright, then we'll... I'll see what Neil wants us to do. Chased all the way over to Palm Springs to be shipped out straight away. So he's got a girl in there at least. God knows who she is but we shall see. So the zoo, here we go. Neil wanted to spend at least a couple of hours here. I know but Neil's worried that every time we go anywhere it's kind of drinks and then lots and lots of shagging. You having a laugh? Wow. You came here earlier? Marvelous, lead the way. Jesus Christ. He's absolutely off his face. Wow. Okay, that was, uhm... a bit scary. But he's going to be alright. He's got severe dehydration so they're gonna keep him over night. Just another example of mental stability, to be honest. We all need to get to bed now. See what the morning brings. Initially obviously we had a big scare. Yeah, in LA. And my first thought was, you know, how is this monitored for sake. Now it's actually apparent that the way things are going, we should be worried about. We obviously can't get the interview with Tinder for obvious reasons, they've not seen any of the footage yet, and that's perfectly understandable. Going back to yesterday and last night. And I know where you and the guys want to take the documentary, and obviously we can't have this, getting pissed and shagging, but I think the Zoo idea was the wrong way to go. In the case of... I'd always told Christian, we won't, which we haven't. - We haven't got involved with any date. - No. But yesterday he flipped. And obviously he's in a state of mind where it's difficult for me as the filmmaker and as a friend, to kind of keep a tab on it. And we're all getting kind of dragged on... And obviously I'm looking like a plank. - Yeah, I mean... - Only... And he's almost purposely doing it. But I think he has got major issues, and I think the more we kind of tamper with it, the worse it's going to go if we start messing around with scenarios that are not... Okay, well I mean, we just wanted something more visual with the zoo and obviously having had it set up in LA which he knew about. We wanted to try and continue that. Honestly last night, I have never, I mean I've never even been talking about drugs before. - OK. - But it was, it was bizarre. Obviously we took him in last night and most. Is he going to be able to do the bangers thing? Well, I dunno, maybe. You think it could help him though? I mean, for me it... No, I personally think it's gonna feed the... I know what you're saying and I completely understand that, if it's... - Is it... - Giving him an alternative when he's on his downtime to actually... rather than sleep with random girls, he can actually do it just in the bedroom. It's a lot safer, and that's that. So I get that. But I think it's almost, it's gonna feed the addiction rather than wean it. - He's checked himself out, by the way. - Right okay, brilliant. He's back in his room so we'll go find out and see if he's up for this virtual reality interview. It's me. You look fucking like death again. You checked yourself out? No, you checked yourself out, you're alright. Have you got nowt on? 'Cause we've set up this interview back in LA at lunch. It's literally quarter to nine now, mate. Yeah, give you 15 minutes, and we'll come back, yeah Then we'll head out, you cool with that? Heading back out in 15 minutes, we're... Sort yourself out and we'll be back. We're here to do the interview for the I never thought, I'd actually be doing an interview with a virtual reality porn company. Wouldn't it be cool to create something new, something that nobody has ever created before? And that's when we came up with the idea of making VR porn. What we're looking at today is an idea to stop adultery or sex, you know, obviously we're working with and we found out that you know point, elements of him always looking for sex and if there's something else that he can use that isn't in reality. Is that something that you look at as a company and wanting to do? We wanted to make something interesting - so there is a possibility to actually even feeling sex. - Yep. So there is different devices - that you can actually purchase and you can connect and make... - Right. ...a more interactive way of feeling the VR porn videos. So can we see it? No, obviously we want to we're, is all downtown in Vegas next week for his schedule and obviously we're wanting to do something there while we're out and about. Is there anything we can... Yeah definitely we can test it out, one second. Sure you don't want to test it? You going to wait till... You want me to do it? Feeling ropey? We've just come back from Palm Springs. Yeah. - You out partying? - I knew that'd happen, yeah. We've had a fair few issues along the way. Oh yeah? What you want, straight, gay, transsexual? What do you think - Whatever makes you happy. - I wouldn't know what I should see. - So you can choose from any of... - Any of those - ...those movies that we shot. So I'm gonna get judged on what I'm picking. OK, this is where I wish had done it. So she'll do anything to get herself out of jail. So? Oh, hang on a minute. Right okay. I just. Right, alright okay. That's pretty real. Right okay. So with the side of people traveling away from their wives etcetera, could you film having sex with your wife and then you would have it when you went away. Is that a possibility with the technology, or would that be... We actually made one experience where you wear a headset, your wife or girlfriend wears a headset and you both see different people. Right okay. - To just kind of spice things up. - Yeah, yeah. It actually reduces cheating. That was an eye opener. To say the least. How you feeling? I like how I had to do that rather than you. So this is the first time I've shared a room with him on this trip, so... Taking my life into my own hands. We're coming for feedback. Well, how else are you supposed to do it? Well, I didn't show you but... Well, that's the idea. Why, what... The what? What the actual fuck? Taking bets what he comes out with? He didn't have to... oh, ey-up. What the fuck? You are fucking kidding me? A lot of people were doing dolls then. Nath threw a... Shut it off, Nath. Right okay. So right, we'll go back and we'll see if this sorts you. On all serious note we're trying to... We're trying to genuinely... Okay. Right okay. No I don't want, that's not gonna sort your problems out. - This may well. - You know. Who said gimp mask? Whoever said gimp mask was fucking well off. Just drive, man. Right, okay. Yeah, yeah. I definitely don't. We're gonna leave you to it for at least 30 seconds. We're not waiting here. You're all looking at me like why are we here. You're having a laugh, aren't you. Come on, we'll come back in a bit. Fucking, Jesus! You could have taken the fuckin' socks off. Put it away. Fucking Christ. The whole point was obviously discussing your sexual addiction ad whether this would help. Not just in pilots in particular, people to fill the time in, rather than involving other human beings and addictions. Do you think it has potential to help you? Right, okay. Is something... Alright then, so that might take the edge off then, so when you're actually going out to meet someone... Right yeah, but that's interesting 'cause I was about to say without the need for sex. So you could go out now wanting sex? So you'd purposely go on Tinder and... I think, alright, okay. No, I certainly didn't want to... ...to see that thing ever again. Yeah, thanks for that. So we're going to do a bit of bonding here now. You're gonna show us... ...your usual haunts. We used to vacation here all the time, my family and then one day my mom was like, "hey we're moving to Vegas." She's a counselor. You might need some help? That's appropriate. So have you ever used Tinder? - No, I've never used it. - No? - That's probably a wise thing. - I do. I have no idea what I'm doing here. I'm going all in. You seem to be quite wise at doing this rather than being reckless It's surprising, I thought you'd be way more reckless. Did you just say you can't be reckless? - You're doing all the gambling. I'm doing all the drinking. - Yes! The reason this documentary needs to work. That's the reason. That sums up my life at the moment. Fucking hell, fucking hell. I'm positive. Even if I didn't have a boyfriend. Viva Las Vegas, I reckon. Six shots of tequila? Sure. Shut the fuck up. Right fuck it, let's do it. I just want to address this now. Just shut the fuck up, what, mate? Right. My glasses are fucked now. Right, rolling, yeah. Still rolling, right. Right, I just want to address last night, mate. I just want to address the fact that... Fucking, I've fucked my glasses as well. I just want to address the fact that I'm having to move me and Nath out the hotel. He's just here to do a job. Do you want to keep rolling this, Nath, or shall we just talk about this off camera once again. You wearing your fucking stupid top. Watch the car, dickhead. Fuck, I'm going to fucking throw up in a minute anyway. Well, that was fucking successful, wasn't it? Right just cut it there, yeah? It just doesn't look good on us as a fucking production, does it? Definitely not. But it is the fucking world we've been dragged into in fairness. But we could all end up looking like absolute twats. But then we've got to be brave enough to say well we've gone on, you know, we're doing this. Then we need to show it as it is. Or at least craft it in a way that it means something and it's going to give people an insight into a fucking world whether it be horrible or not. So in a nutshell, where do you think this leaves us then? I don't know. I genuinely don't know. Yo, you guys better find the girl and the guy and the match and the love. Absolutely, we'll we're trying, it's not been easy. I know you guys will, I know you will, have a good day. Nice to speak to you, fellas, take care. Nothing to do with the stewardess? You don't want to talk about this stewardess, do you? You alright, boys? What do you think about the, well any dating app really, what do you think about? - It's convenient, I've gotten a lot of free pizza. - Yeah. Have you had any good experience or bad experience by dating apps? Mostly good. I've seen, I've met a couple of people that definitely didn't look like their picture, like at all. Yeah we've seen plenty of that along the way. Yeah, off you go. See, I'm a bit confused. 'Cause he was talking about a stewardess last week and I'm not sure if that's the stewardess or not. But I'm not going to ask. There they are, there they are. Fucking hell. Thank you. In the car. Oh, he has his moments. He makes me laugh now and again. Not very often, though. He is on one last strike as they say here in the US. And he knows it. Having said that, I don't think he gives a flying fuck, does he, so... - So me saying one last strike isn't going to mean anything. - Not at all. Oh, here she is. Where's though? - Did he come down before you? - Yeah. Where the hell is he? Do you mind doing one more run for us? - Okay, that's fine. - See if you can see him. Yeah, is that all right? Sorry. Cheers, thanks. Now this isn't awkward at all, is it? She'll probably find him in a heap down there. Trying to impress her. - Is anyone getting that feeling again? - Yeah. Well, that's fucking unanimous, isn't it? No? Not there? Was I supposed to wait, no? I thought, was he coming up? No? Right, we're going to sack this off, I think. 'Cause, yeah. - Sorry about this. - That's OK. Right, we're going to see if we can see him. Is he over there, Noah, at all? No? Okay, you walking back there or are you going to do a bit? I can walk back over with you guys. Yeah, cool. Are you fucking taking the piss, what's the matter? What the fuck? Have you driven off with the car? Hello? Hello. Yeah, very funny. You what? You're in fucking Denver! Nah, you're taking the pi... Nah, stop fucking... Stop fucking about, you idiot, I'm not in the mood. I've been stood around for nearly fucking two hours now. I'm at a fucking loss here. I mean that girl's still here but there's no way I want... Do you want to ask her for a lift? How awkward is that going to be? This is the last straw, man. This is the final fucking chance. Is it a bullshit date or? So this is the stewardess then because you were confusing me with what you told me about a stewardess. And I'm asking that poor girl that turned up on a genuine Tinder date that you've just fucking left in the middle of nowhere and she's got to give a film crew a lift fucking into Denver. So what the fuck are you doing now, you going out? I don't know if we're gonna come, to be honest, mate. I'm this close to going fuck it. Having a good time? - Are you going to introduce us or? - No. - Pleased to meet you. Al. - Hi, pleased to meet you, I'm Lauren. Nice to meet you, Lauren. No, we'll leave you to it. We're getting used to it now, we can do yeah. I'm trying my best, but the enthusiasm has gone a little bit. To be honest then I drew a blank when they came out. I'm out, I'm out of... Because he's... because he hasn't kind of complied. It feels like now when he does something like that, he's almost doing it on purpose knowing full well that I'm not exactly prepared for it now 'cause I'm just waiting for the next shit storm. Oh, hey up. - Are you going? - Yeah. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Everything okay? - Yeah, it's fine. Yeah, do you want to talk to us or? Okay, that's cool. Okay, nice to meet you anyway. And you, take care. Bye now. Bit awkward. She came out looking scared to death, to be honest. I thought is at it again. So, he's actually just been bombed out, guys. He hasn't said anything inappropriate at all. He's losing his touch. So she was the girl that we were looking for but you weren't. So you did say something. I just went in there then and said, what have you said, and you said, oh absolutely nothing. Right, we're going home now, yeah? We all up for some food, yeah? Those words "trust me" are not in my... You taking the piss? Mate, that's the most depraved thing I've ever heard in my fucking life. And I'm telling you now, if you're not fucking joking, that's it. I'm not just talking the documentary, I'm talking that's it, so it's your choice. If you go and do that I swear to fucking God. I'm walking off, we're flying back tomorrow, that's it. Right you do what you got to do, mate, but I'm telling you now, if you go through with that it stops here. That's it between you and me so you need to decide whether our friendship is worth your fucking sickness. Right, okay. Let's fucking go. Come on, let's fucking go, I can't... Nah, I'm not, no. Can you fucking believe that? Of all the fucking shit he's done that's the worst thing I've ever fucking heard. You need some serious... what d'you mean? You better be fucking with us right now 'cause I'm seriously. You told us months ago you'd been tested. That's the fucking reason we carried on. From man to man, you need some fucking serious psychological fucking help. You fucking little prick. I'll fucking kill you, you little shit. Life's too short to fall in love, so I'll just fall in lust with you. So yeah. So this happened? Got with Elle and this happened. Meet Tindy, only joking, Ebony.
