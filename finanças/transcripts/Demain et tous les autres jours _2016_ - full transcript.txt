Witch, witch, hands in the air... Witch, witch, on the count of three, we'll set you free TOMORROW AND THEREAFTER I forgot why we're here. Just to meet. I'd like Mathilde to come and discuss her problems. Do we say "I forget" why I'm here or "I forgot" why I'm here? Maybe we should say "I can't remember why we're here". I dislike wavering like this. That's all to your credit. It's a mistake. We can't say "I forgot why I'm here". It's ugly. I beg your pardon. Don't worry. It can happen to anyone. Mathilde is a good student, but I feel she's having a hard time making friends. I never, ever make that kind of mistake. We can also say "I've forgotten why I'm here". That's right. Just like your mother, you like to speak perfect French. I don't know what got me confused. - How are things at home? - Good. Good. I don't make that kind of mistake. I don't know what got into me. Honey... a nest in the tree! You see? Take off your shoes. Climb up. Look. Over there. I see it! Thanks very much. I still don't know why we came, but it was... It was really nice. Wait for me here. I'm not a good mother. - Yes. - No. I'm sure you do your best. She's a very nice woman. Earth Moon, Earth Moon, I left my old atmosphere Start again, slowly. I left my old atmosphere I left the dread and the wars... "Dead", not "dread". ...the dead and the wars. Goodbye! The next stanza... Lola. In the sky dotted with planets, all alone, on a deserted moon, I'll laugh at the stupid world, and at men who act like animals. That was perfect. I want to hear every word! Yanis, recite the fourth one. Earth Moon, Earth Moon, Farewell, my life. Farewell, my love. Globe crippled with pain. Goodnight. By Boris Vian. Very good, perfect. I really like it. It's a shy dress. Don't you think? I'd like to try with the veil. Mind if I take a few steps? Don't leave the department. It's like an astronaut outfit. - It suits you perfectly. - You're pretty too. - Our future husbands are lucky. - I don't have one. You're not getting married? With life. Bye, Mathilde. Goodbye, ma'am. Mom? Do you see me? I see you. You can watch me sleep. Wake me if I have a nightmare. We were clear with the nightmares. Your room is off-limits. You said it worked. Not last night. What was your nightmare? I was sitting in a rubber raft, in the middle of the ocean. You were swimming beside me. Then you let go of the raft. And you said... "Bye-bye, Mathilde." That's no dream. You just made it up. How did you guess? Because I know everything. So what did I get in dictation? 19/20? Almost. 18. I'm right. Mrs. Escoffier got it wrong. You got 19. Check! Get your mother. She's not here. Not there? In the bath. In the bath or not there? Not here. It's 9. If she's not back by 9:30, call me. - You promise? - I promise. Sealed with spit? My patient just came. I have to hang up. I'll hang up first. All right. One... two... Goodbye. Is it late? Yes. What's on your head? What's that dress? What will you eat? I already ate. I'll make up for this tomorrow. Okay. I'm suddenly tired. I'll go to sleep. Tomorrow will be better. I'll get off on the right foot. Goodnight, honey. Goodnight. Her name was Gwendoline. She was your great-great-great grandmother. She heard voices in the wind. They told her to go into the forest. At first, she went only by day. But the voices really wanted to make her go there at night. How dangerous. That night, there was a full moon. She couldn't resist. She walked for a long time... and arrived near a pond. Suddenly, the air became ice-cold! And the face of her only daughter appeared under the water. Then what happened? She ran back home, but the moon vanished and the forest became black. The wind voices started laughing. They said... "Never again will you see your daughter!" How terrible! She ran inside... Her daughter was gone! Instead, in her bed, was just a piece of wood. What an awful story! And it's not over. Her pain was insufferable. During every full moon, she'd stand still, by the pond. After a while, she turned into a dog. She became an old dog, wire-thin. All she could do was turn round and round the pond. - What is it? - A surprise. Is it you who bought it? It came by itself. Through the window. Careful, it's fragile. Is it a toy? A musical instrument? Sometimes. A drum? - It takes up a lot of room. - No, it's tiny. Almost like a human, but not a human shape. An elf. I don't hear a thing. It's dead. Open it. Quickly! Gently and quickly! Come. Here. This is your home. A nice O. A big I. A scary U. And a big A. Stay concentrated. Viva, viva, viva! Viva la liberta! Proud. You're heroes! Goodnight, honey. Freezing. Dad? Getting warmer. You're burning. You're on fire! Is that you talking? Who else? I'm scared. I'm not that scary. Tada! - Mom! - No! No, wait, wait! My bird talks. He hooted? No, he talked. Talk again. Say hi to my mom. Say hi to her. It's late. Time to go to bed. Don't chatter, you two. But... My mother will think I'm crazy. She's the one who's crazy. Just kidding. Come on, Mathilde, it was a joke. And yes, she's a bit crazy. We can speak frankly. Don't you think? - Why didn't you say hi? - She wouldn't have heard. Only you can hear me. Only you. You'll talk to me tomorrow? Tomorrow... and every other day. He's all pale! Is it a real one? Is it real? - This is a human skeleton. - He's dead? That of a man, in fact. He's all rotten. The human skeleton contains 206 bones. Write this down. Get in single file for a better view. Gently! Please don't touch it. Clara? Lola, don't let anyone touch it. - Can I have a word? - Coming. Don't touch it! What are you doing? Is he your husband? You bought him spare eyes? Goodbye. Come on, Oscar... let's go. His name isn't Oscar! All skeletons are named Oscar. I'm back. Have a nice day? Yes. Me too. I like this room a lot. Really? You won't want to escape? Not my style. I don't want to do homework, just talk to you. Do your homework. We'll speak after. I'm here. I have to tell you a secret. See this key? It's for a closet at school. In the closet is someone... who's dead. - A skeleton. - He died in the closet? I don't think so. School skeleton. I don't know where they got it. Maybe they stole if from a cemetery. Man or woman? Man. The janitor takes him out and walks him in the classes. The kids laugh and tease him. You think he realizes? Of course. His soul is there. So it's awful. Awful. He was alive. Now he's dead. He had a heart that beat. Eyes that saw. He spoke. He was happy sometimes. Maybe he liked to joke around? Now he's in the dark in his bag. It's like he's asking me something. Don't leave him. Set him free. All right. You'll need a big bag. What's that, witch? A corpse. Crazy! I'll get a friend. Don't move. Ready to meet him? Yes. I'm so moved. Ask if he wants clothes. Would you like some clothes? How do we know? The dead must be covered. The answer is yes. I don't want him to be alone underground. In the dark. In the cold. But he's dead. The dark and cold can't hurt him. He feels nothing. But I talk to him. You act like he's alive. He is a little alive. If I ask you "Is he alive or dead?", what do you answer? Dead. We bury the dead. Or else their souls go crazy. White Fang "Sir... "I'll never know your hair color, "if your eyes were blue or brown. "I didn't know you well, "yet you became my friend. "I'll never forget you. "In your grave, remember that every day above ground, "Mathilde Zaessinger is thinking of you." I love you. Mathilde, where are you? The station. Be there in 30 minutes. - Did you do it? - Yes. You buried him? Yes. You're the bravest girl ever. His soul will watch over you. Hurry. I'm waiting. Sleep is on a holiday My God! Where could it have gone? Although I am rocking my little one, he is crying in his crib He's been crying since noon Where is it that Sleep has put its sand and tranquil dreams Although I'm rocking my little one, he rolls over, covered in sweat He is sobbing in his bed Ah, come back, come back, Sleep on your handsome race horse In the black sky, the Great Bear has buried the sun and lit back up his starry bees If the child does not sleep well, he will not say good morning He will not say anything tomorrow to his fingers, to the milk, to the bread that greets him with the day Now, "Queen of Hearts". Mathilde. Ready? Nonchalantly leaning against her windows of moon The Queen gestures to you with an almond flower She is the Queen of Hearts She can, if she wishes, lead you in secret to strange dwellings... Go on. ...dead people come to talk of love The Queen salutes you, hastens you to follow her into her palace of frost with smooth stained-glass moon windows Bravo. Please, Mathilde. Let's continue with "Queen of Hearts". Mom? - Want something to eat? - No, thanks. Are you thirsty? Shall I read to you? No, I'm okay. I'll sleep a little. Want some music? She still hasn't left her room. It's day two. She won't get up. I can't even open her curtains. Maybe she doesn't like Christmas. I sure don't. You're like my Dad. I like Christmas. Why doesn't your dad come spend it here? Seeing each other makes them sad. I'd rather not. Sad people are a pain. Good morning! A guinea fowl from Auvergne. - For how many? - Two. That one, please. That one? Christmas has started. Mom! Mom disappeared. Oh shit. - Maybe she went to buy me a gift? - Yeah... Another minute. For almost 2 hours we've watched time go by. The minutes go fast, the hours slowly. So we can't know if time is going fast or slow. Both together, I think. We can try to push the big hand with our eyes, to speed it up. We can try... I'll push it forward. Let's do it. Go faster. Faster. Ma'am? End of the line. Are you all right? Come. We're at the station. Come, ma'am. Take your bag. Come on... Come on, ma'am... Stand up. Come this way. Is this the Zaessinger household? Hello, ma'am. FÃ©camp station here. Your sister is with us. She blanked out a bit. We'll send her to Paris. You think she can travel alone? - Absolutely. - Great. We'll see to it. Her train arrives at 12:04, St. Lazare. You'll pick her up? Yes, I'll pick her up. I'll tell her. - Merry Christmas, ma'am. - Thanks, same to you. Shit! Whore! Shit! Christmas sucks big-time. What are you doing? Why did you go to FÃ©camp, motherfucking whore? Because I'm crazy, crazy, crazy! You're not crazy, you're mean! Meanest fucking whore on earth! I smell something weird. I think the fowl is cooked. Shit! Poor thing. No! Don't do that. I can't look. Your mom's bathrobe! Hurry! Hurry! Wet it! It has to be soaked. Please, hurry. Quick! Quick! Put it on! With the hood! Take the gloves. On the table. Wet them. Take off the curtain! Take off the curtain! Pull. As hard as you can! - I can't! - Cover your face! Go get a wet towel. Hurry! You throw it! Throw it! Stomp on it. Go get another! Careful! I almost had a heart attack. No, I'm fine. 12:04. 12:04 is tomorrow. It's another day. I think it'll be a good day. Think so? May tomorrow... bring us... Victory. Yes. When you wake up, I'll ask to be forgiven. Give me an order. Go on. Be gentle, please. No "please" or "be gentle". It's not the game. You give orders and I obey. So... Put your head under water and count to 7. Please. Another order. I'm out of ideas. My turn. Wash me. Faster! Arms. Everywhere. Butt! Dry my toes. Dress me. No. Make me a baby. Your hand. Repeat after me: "I make you a baby." I make you a baby. Good. Dress me fast. Repeat after me: "You're a horrible little girl." It's the order game. Say it or I'll slam my head into the wall. You're a horrible little girl. "But you'll be a good mother." But... you'll be a good mother! Mathilde, you're not happy. I'm very happy. Everything's settled now. You don't realize you're unhappy. - I think you're a prisoner. - You live in a cage! I'm a pet bird. You're a wild girl, prisoner of a crazy mother. Don't badmouth my mother. Ever! I'm not badmouthing. It's the truth. You're stupid. You understand nothing. Dumb bird, shut up! You want me to shut up? Fine. I'll shut up. Mom? Honey... The new tenants arrive in an hour. We have very little time. I put two suitcases in your room. Pack your comforter, your pillow and your clothes. Your school stuff. Everything you can't do without. I know, an hour to pack everything... It's tough, but we'll manage. We must be calm and efficient. Why didn't you tell me before? Because I learned this morning the new tenants were coming. Fortunately they found us a new place. I hear it's nice and bright. Where is it? I haven't been able to memorize the address. I wrote it down. 17 Avenue de Villiers. We'll never be able to take all this. For the new tenants at least let's take our personal stuff. We'll come for the rest tomorrow. With a truck. The taxi gets here in 55 minutes. Get moving. - Her mind's moving! - You're talking! No time for kisses. The wind's blowing. Storm coming. - Think we're really moving? - No... but follow the wind. A word of advice: pack light. Don't forget my seed. Yes? Can you open up for us, please? Can you please open? Good evening. I'm Mrs. Zaessinger, the new tenant. It was you on the intercom? My daughter, Mathilde. You're Mrs. Lesieur? - We're moving in. - Into the building? We're moving in here. - Into the building. - Here. You're not ready? I understand. It was very rushed for us too. We can sit in a corner while you finish packing. We can help, too. Right, Mathilde? But we're not moving. I'm sorry. It says so here. Bruno, come here. She thinks we're leaving and she's moving in. You're mistaken, ma'am. I have this paper. We're the new tenants of this apartment starting at 6 pm. - We're sorry. Goodbye, ma'am. - Wait... Sir, we rushed... to pack up in a hurry. We're very tired and we're offering to help. Come. Give me that paper. This means nothing. Listen, ma'am, we've been patient. You must leave now. You can see this is our home. You have 45 minutes to pack. The time I had to do mine. Have a seat. Boys, go back into the kitchen. Sit down. Do we call the police? My name is Mrs. Lesieur. I live at 17 Avenue de Villiers. A woman came into our house and won't leave. All right. Thank you. They'll be here in 15 minutes. I won't budge. I have this paper. I have this paper. - Can you call my father? - Sure. Can you make us herbal tea? Put some rum in mine. I think I'll sleep here, if you don't mind. A few days, till you feel better. I'd rather not. Shall I take Mathilde to my place? You'll be all alone. I'll be better off alone. I'll sleep here tonight. It's better. I can't say. I'd worry about you alone. I can't say. Can you find me a sleeping bag? And a pillow? We left them there. No big deal. We'll buy more tomorrow. The softest, most expensive. A toothbrush? Your father's a good guy. Finally someone sensible in this house. I'm afraid he'll make her run away again. We'll keep an eye on her. We'll stay alert. - May - tomorrow - bring - us - vic - tory. Night. Goodnight. Time to sleep. My thoughts keep running away. I have to catch up to them. My eyes see things differently. I have to catch up to them too. I have to force them. Shall I take you to the hospital? Take Mathilde to your place. Everything is too close. Even your hand. It's too heavy. What are you doing? What are you doing with this suitcase? Look. Throw away those suitcases. All of them. I'm writing you a poem. I'm almost done. Read. "My daughter Mathilde is what's dearest to me. "She fills my heart. She makes it beat. "Without her, I'd dry up like a dead leaf. "I'd crumble. The wind would scatter me all over. "Yes, really. I'd rather die than be separated from her." I'm not at home. Yes, you are. It's not my house. It's not my room. She doesn't recognize her room. - When does your father get back? - 11. Act like everything's normal. You really think God exists? Yes. See you tonight. I'll take her to the doctor. A good one? One of the best. - When will you be back? - No idea. Got the key? Which pair would you rather take? These? "Suddenly, the sky became pink," - comma - "a pink that was joyful," - comma - "loving," comma... Period. "She looked, - comma - "surprised now "as if before a phenomenon..." I need to talk to you. He's taking her to a hospital. She'll stay. They're leaving. Find a way to leave. May I use the restroom? Run! "... daybreak - comma - wondering..." Where are you going? Mom! What do I tell Mathilde? Tell her... I have her face in my head. I'll say you always watch over her. I'll take good care of her. Every minute. Yes. I'll come visit you with her. In a few months. Once the doctors allow it. I'd like you to put the apartment up for sale. I won't go back. Don't you think it's a bit early for a decision like that? I won't go back. You can't live your life here. I've often thought about it. Even before our separation? Even before Mathilde was born. You can go now. Mommy... Mom? Can you help me? Let's make a poem, the two of us. My daughter... why is your hair so wet? Because I walked too long in the storm. Good. My daughter... where are the little shoes I bought you? They didn't fit anymore. I threw them into a ditch. Not into a ditch. My feet grew... and I left my little shoes by the side of the road. My daughter... where did your first baby tooth go? A mouse buried it deep in a forest. My daughter, where did the tears of your first sorrow go? Your hand dried them. The wind dried your hand. They evaporated and fell back down as rain, farther away. My daughter... where did our days go, our nights, your nightmares... and your birthdays? They're locked up in a box at the bottom of the sea. To GeneviÃ¨ve Lvovsky Subtitling TITRAFILM
