Bring me some water, son. Hasan? COMMITMENT: HASAN Hello? What is it, Serdar? I'm spraying the trees in the back orchard. What's up? Tell me. Who? Why have they come? Okay. Okay. Keep them occupied. Make sure they don't leave before I get there. I'll be coming up right away. Okay, see you in a bit. Nisa, take this. - Do these make any money? - It depends. - Last year we did pretty good. - Good. These go for about five liras in the supermarket. - How many kilos are there in here? - We figure by tons, not by kilos. We've got about 15 to 20 tons here. You kidding me? I've seen pink ones, pretty large. Do you raise them? No, we don't raise them. Ours are longer and smaller. You should raise those. - Do you sell them on local market? - We send them off to Istanbul, to the wholesale market. And Hasan's here. Finally. Welcome. Thanks. Mr. Hasan, we stopped by for a 10-minute spot of business... but your man here made us wait for an hour. Yeah, that's how he is. So what's up? We're with the New Current Energy Company. My name's Servet. A power line is going to pass through this area here. One of the main utility towers will be set up on your field. We're here to take some measurements to mark its place. How come? We already have a utility pole here. That... That one's nothing. We're going to be installing a special type of tower, a 2FB581A. It's an industrial utility tower. It carries high power to the industrial zone. The line will go all the way down through here. So, can I ask where exactly you will be erecting the tower? Follow me please. Look. That's where we're going to be putting it. - Right in the middle of the field? - Well, I don't know that. In this whole wide country you chose my land to erect this? They're also going to build a transformer. Hold on a sec, Serdar. What? They will add a transformer. A transformer? Well, it has to have a transformer. Come on now! We make our living from this land. Do you know how many people live off of here? You're not the only one to be affected. The line is going to cut through many fields here. Come on. Let me show you. Hold this down. Look, here is where we are now. This is your land. From up here all the towers are going to follow a line. The satellite has determined the best locations to do this. - So, this was shot from a satellite? - Yep, exactly so. - It doesn't look like our place. - As if you've seen it from above. Shut up, Serdar. - What are those men doing there? - They are calculating the size... of the land we'll have to appropriate. You'll be compensated for the loss of land... depending on the number of square meters the company needs. What if I refuse to give my consent? Will you install it by force? Well... We are acting on orders. Our job is to make the calculations. So, we're here to measure up. Look here. Do you know how many tons of tomatoes are in this field? And just think about the fertilizer, the pesticide... our toil and all our efforts. We put our life's work in here. Those towers also poison the soil. I've heard no grass ever grows in those high voltage area. It's possible. I mean... Why not? You have a point there. You know better than I do. What do I know about farming and tomatoes? Mr. Engineer, would you come with me please? Sure. Hold this down. - Remind me about your name again. - Servet. Look here, Servet. As you see, this is a fallow field. Why don't you install the tower here? It is just 60-70 meters away from the other site. Mr. Hasan. It's not up to me really. The plan's been drawn up, approved, and the prep pre-build has started. - Nothing can be done at this point. - But look for yourself. This is a planted land, that one is completely barren. Wouldn't it make more sense to install it there? I get your point. I really do. Talk to the higher-up. I don't know if it'll work, but you can try. Okay, then when are you going to install these towers? In a month or two. Take care, man. Welcome home, brother Hasan. Your wife went down to the market. The food is ready. Are you hungry? - No thanks. - Shall I get you some tea then? Well, you'd better bring me some yogurt drink. Okay. Damn. It's on everywhere. Why did you bring in the boy along? What if something happens to him? You go to your mother. Did you hear me? Get lost! Now! Serdar, Don't tell a thing to my wife or to Nisa. Okay. Don't worry about it. Who knows maybe it'll rain. Hope so. Look, there's the cat and the birds. Bury them in a suitable place far from there here, okay? Sure, man. Don't worry about it. And make sure the boy keeps his mouth shut. Okay, fine. Kadir, is that your dad? It is so hot. I've cut up some watermelon. Shall I get you some? Please do. - You're here. - Yes. - You're back early. - It is too hot to be out. - I rushed back home. - Right. It is really hot today. Kadir! Kadir! Kadir! Here you are. Come over here. Take this. - You okay? - I'm okay. Thanks. So what did you do? I dropped by Esma's place. - Did you like her work? - Not bad. What is this? Treat for Berdush. Hello, Uncle Hasan. Hi, Kadir. Keriman called today. She sends her regards. - Alaikum selam, how are they doing? - Doing well. Elif got her report card. - She passed with flying colours. - Well done to her. She is asking what kind of gift her uncle will give her. Whatever she wants. - What grade is she in now? - Third. They grow up so fast. Eser was also in third grade when your dad died. - Was she? - She must have been. No you are mistaken. She must have been younger. The school was over by the old house back then, remember? It's been years. I can't recall. She was in the third grade when the court case was finalized. When the judge decided that we would get the house, we waited for another year before moving in. Have you forgotten? Right. We waited. Our lawyer said that they might appeal. You have such a good memory. How can I forget. It was hard times. Tea should be ready. Berdush! Berdush! Berdush! Aren't you having one? - No, I am going to bed. - Why so early? I have to get up early to buy pesticides. I thought you just bought some? The tomatoes are infected with something else. I should take care of it before it gets out of hand. Really? Who was it that came down to the field today? Nobody. Just a middleman buyer. Good night. Good night. Berdush? Okay, sir. No, no. There were a couple of issues but we already sorted them out. I'll send the plan to you by tomorrow. The document? It's arrived but... Yes we received it, sir. Yes, sir. Yes. Same here. Have a great day. Honestly, what you're asking simply cannot be done. There are 137 towers on that line. For God's sake. 137 towers. Just think, if we would change each one's place like that... those lines will be all tangled up. I am not asking you to shift the line to another village. Move it 60-70 meters away, at most 100 meters, to the empty field. It's not that complicated. Well, well... Have you talked to the owner of that 100-meter away land? What does he say about it? No, I didn't. So... now we're supposed to go up to him and say "Mr. Hasan didn't want it so... we decided to put the tower here." Then he will say I don't want it either." Then we go to Osman and then to Ali... Going from this land to that land. Do you think this job would ever get done? So you are saying the plan cannot be changed. There's no way to get around this? No other solution? No. No. So you say. Where can we resolve this issue quickly? From here, or from Ankara? Mr. Hasan what does it have to do with Ankara? Our management office is here. If you want, you can go downtown and talk to the regional head. But it just won't work. The plan has been finalized, the route is set, the line is set. How can it be impossible? I saw it myself. Your engineer came up and showed us on the map. It is easy. He will just move it from here to there on the map. It's is not a huge deal. Do we have to go to court for this? Hi, Ibrahim. What's up? Yeah I called you earlier. What about the rooster? Not crowing? How can I know why it's not crowing? But you told me you'd make it crow. Why have I given it to you then? Okay. Where are you now? Order some meatballs for me. I'm coming down right now. See you. So, I mean it is very difficult. Berdush! Berdush! Berdush! Berdush! Where have you been, boy? Berdush. Look I've brought you a treat. Berdush! Berdush! Berdush is not around Hasan. I've searched everywhere. He'll come back. Don't worry about it. If I hadn't gotten him spayed, I'd assume he went after females. Yeah, right. - There's eggplant dish in the fridge. - Sure. Look here. I want to talk to you about something. I was over at Fatma's place this morning. Seyfi is selling his land. Why would he do that? - They took out a loan. - And couldn't pay it back? They couldn't make their payments. They're strapped for money. What if we buy it off them? We could get it at a bargain. Why should we get involved with their seized property? And peach business is dead. You know that better than I do. Am I talking about peaches here? - Thanks darling. - Enjoy. That land would be about 25 acres, right? Yes. More or less. They're saying a zoning permit will be issued for that area soon. And you ladies get together to talk those things for God's sake? Also, there is no such thing. Stop fiddling away. Stop and listen to what I am saying. You know Fikri's brother-in-law's partner is a contractor. Yes, he is. They're planning to build condominiums with pools in that area. Who's making all that up for God's sake? He knows people in the municipality. He's heard it from them. So the zoning permit will be issued for the entrance or the exit of town? Well how about you do something and find out for yourself? You listened to me and uprooted the quinces to plant apples. It turned out for the good, didn't it? Now everybody has financial woes, while you're enjoying your life. What are you up to Kadir? Dad asked for an elbow. Let me know if you see Berdush around. I'll give you some pocket money, okay? Okay. Go on, now. 115, 117, 118... They gave a statement that there are 130 trees... it turns out there are 118. Why would you do this? As if we wouldn't find out. Lying for the sake of a few trees. What is the bank going to do with the land? The same as they always do. Sell, of course. Was it your bank that Seyfi got his loan from? The guy who owns the peach orchard down along the canal? - Yes, him. - Yes, he took out a loan from us. I authorized it myself. Is something the matter, Hasan? They say it's going to go into foreclosure. You didn't sign as his guarantor, did you? No way. God forbid. We do our best to make sure these kinds of situations don't happen. But what can we do if he doesn't know how to manage his finances? How much does he owe to the bank anyway? Well ethically speaking I'm not allowed to tell you that. You know Mr. Seyfi has put his place up for sale. Yeah, so I heard. Now I get it. You want to buy that place. - No, I'm just curious. - Okay. - Have you talked to Seyfi yet? - Nope. Look here. It is a 20-acre land parcel. And it's been planted with first quality peach trees. A canal runs alongside the property. So it is well-watered. 85,000 would be fair. Anything higher won't leave a profit for you. If you have cash, I'd say don't miss this opportunity. If you don't have cash, then come see me, I could immediately get you a loan, promise. Keep this to yourself, though. Hello, son. Good, I am good. How are you doing? Good. Happy to hear that. Hold on a second son. To Auntie Emine? Yes, go ahead son. Excuse me? Was it finalized today? I have totally forgotten about it. Did you tell your mom yet? Okay don't then. I'll tell her myself. No, I am happy about it. It's just that... Hold on a sec. I was waiting someone's call, and he is on the line now. Okay, okay. I'll call you back. Okay? Thanks. Bye. Hi, yes, Judge. Sorry, I was talking to my son. Yes, I did call you around noon. Yes, Judge. I've something to talk to you about. I called you for some advice. They plan on running a high voltage power tower through my land. So, I called to get your advice. Hold on a second, Judge. We're looking for Mrs. Emine's house but we couldn't find it. Could you tell us where? Okay madam, turn left from there and keep walking straight. - Okay. - Welcome. - Take it easy. - Thanks. Sorry about that, Judge. They're planning to put a utility tower in the middle of my land, and a transformer next to it. Half of the land would be gone, Judge. Which land? The one that you see fit to us during the hearing, remember? Yes. The same. That land, sir. Well, let me get a better look. Hold it up a bit. But it's supposed to have blue borders. - A blue border? - Yes. No, Mrs Emine, you asked it to be a solid color, said your daughter likes solid colors, remember? But Nisa was also here. Just before we left we wanted it to have a blue border. And you agreed. Is that right, Nisa? Yes, I think it that's what happened. Well I swear that I don't remember it like that. And I rushed to finish it on time. Maybe I am becoming just too forgetful. What am I supposed to say to my daughter? Accept it this way for this once. No way. I can't do that. I promised her. So, what am I supposed to do with this now? - I put my sweat and toil in it. - But it's not what I asked for. Remind me again how much you asked for it? We agreed on 1200. And I gave you 200 in advance, didn't I? Yes, you paid 200 up-front, there's a remainder of 1000 liras. Well then, let's split the loss. It did not turn out as I wanted, so I'll pay you 700 more and we'll call it even. Shall we? I understand what you are saying... but I worked day in and out to finish it on time. That much won't do. It's up to you. Pack it up again, sweetie! Why are you upset now? You're the one at fault. You should be offering me a discount. Sweetie, take 200 liras from my wallet and hand it to the lady. 200 liras. We'll take our leave then. Where is the way out? Are there any eggs? There are. Around seven or eight. Fridge is full of eggs. Take half of them to Kadir and the rest to Esma's granddaughter. - Okay. - That poor child is so skinny. - Do they go to same school as Kadir? - Yes. Give this to her as well... a little pocket money for her. They may be needy. Thanks ma'am. Take it easy. There is fresh brewed tea. - Shall I get you some? - No need. Come and sit down with me. I have some good news. - Tell me. - Fatih called me today. Hajj application draw results are out, we are going. I swear I saw it in my dream. You wanted this so bad and now here it is. I told you we would get on the list this time. Yes, you did. Let's start the preparations. OK... - We should sacrifice a sheep. - Why is that? Remember I made a vow to sacrifice a sheep when we get selected? Okay, let's do it then. Let me tell my brother right away. They will be so happy. Thank God. Thank God. Thank God. - What was his name again? - Muzaffer, Muzaffer Yilmaz. Let's do it like this... a board meeting is scheduled for the day after tomorrow. We can solve your problem then. We can't possibly turn down Mr. Mehmet's request, can we? Thanks so much sir. My pleasure. It's no big deal really. We just moved it from here to there. It is a huge deal for us. We don't want a meter of our land get wasted. Definitely. So I should go now. Have a nice day. - Welcome, Hasan. - Hello, Judge. You shouldn't have gone to all that trouble. This is no trouble at all. We can't ever repay our debt to you. Don't even mention it. So what have you brought? Best quality cherries and mulberries. - These are hard to find around here. - Nice. Where do you think we should plant them? Well, Judge, I'd say the other side would be best, but it's up to you. I did what you suggested before I came here. Don't worry. Everything will be handled without upsetting anyone. As long as Muzaffer doesn't get wind of it. No, he won't. They rent the field. They don't use it themselves. They are mainly engaged in dairy operations. Anyway, they will be compensated for the use of that land... so it won't matter to them. Great then. Here you go. Your yard is really beautiful. The walnut at the gate also took root well. True, true. It looks healthy. If it weren't for this, retirement would be difficult. I spend all my time now on this yard. - You have really done a good job. - Thanks. By the way can you find me a good pear sapling. Sure, sir. What kind? - The big ones called Santa Maria. - Sure, I'll look for one. But will it grow in my garden? Sure it will. I'll look around and bring you the best I can find. How are the kids doing? Both are doing very well. Thank God. Fatih is in Istanbul, working at the customs office. Eser is in nursing school. Mashallah. - I'd better get going. - Are you leaving already? I need to drop by the muftiate. The muftiate? Why do you want to go there? We've been selected for the pilgrimage list. I'll be going with my wife. Your money is burning a hole in your pocket, My wife longs for it, sir. Well, then. May God accept your pilgrimage. - I'll be going now. - Good bye. - Hello, what's up, Seyfi? - Hi, Hasan. - How are you? - Fine, thanks. And you? I'm good, God bless. Long time no see. How have you been doing? - That's true. And how are you? - Good, good. - Kids and family? - All good. What about yours? Good. Good. God bless. All is good. What's this? Are you installing a new irrigation line? No not that. You keep loading. Come with me. I wish that was it. You have no idea what happened to us. - What's happened? - I am done. I am finished. Tell me what happened! Those bastards said peaches would bring in good money... so we replanted the entire orchard. I took out a bank loan and planted peach saplings, it didn't work out. I wanted to dig them all up and plant pear instead. They said that there would be a rush on peaches next year. But that didn't happen either. So we went bankrupt. - It's bad you got rid of the apples. - I wish I had known better. The loan payment is overdue, but I'm unable to pay. The bank keeps adding interest every day. That's terrible. I didn't know that. So... what are you going to do? Well, there is nothing I can do. The bank is going to foreclose on the land. - Don't forget the elbows here! - You serious? - How come? - That's how it is. They're going to foreclose on my land. I asked around to borrow money. But no one has cash. Everyone is paying off a mortgage or loan. My daughter in Istanbul says "That's enough with farming, Dad" Well, I don't know what to do. Maybe I should just sell it off and get out of this for good. How much are you asking for? Bare land would go for between 130 to 140,000. Add the peaches to that, then it should make 160,000, right? - How many acres have you got here? - 21 acres. My! Hasan why don't I sell you this land? What do you think? I'd really like to help you out, but I don't have that much money. Really? Maybe we can find a middle way. Just make me an offer. Tell me what kind of figure you have in mind. Just spit it out. Don't hold back. Why are we standing in the sun? Let's have some tea. We can talk more easily then. Come on. Come have a seat. Go on. Sit. 60,000. - What? - 60,000. No way. What are you saying? You see all these trees. And I am talking about 21-acres of land. You are right, Seyfi. I shouldn't really even consider this. Well, of course it will be sold off sooner or later... but I just wish it wouldn't go to a stranger. Okay, but what would I do with peaches anyway. If I buy the land, I'll have to dig them all up. Okay, forget about the peaches. Let's just talk about the land. Still your offer is impossible. I can ask my son. If he can give me 10,000 then with 70.000 we will call it a deal. No way. Go up a bit on that, a bit more. I can't afford more than that. Look here, Hasan. I swear I owe the bank 60,000. I should at least be able to pocket 30,000. I'm losing all my family's land. I'm telling you, this is a fertile land. Okay. Let's just forget about this then. I don't want to upset you anymore. Well... Can't you really go up a little bit more? Well, you see, I'll be facing even more expenses, pesticides, fertilizers, the saplings, diesel, field workers. It is an investment and there is a risk involved with. I wish I could help you out. But I understand you, too... Can't you increase it by at least 10,000? For your sake I will increase to 75,000. Can you pay in a lump sum? Okay, Seyfi. I promise to pay for it in one lump sum. Okay, then. Deal. - I hope it brings you luck. - You too. - Brother Seyfi. - Yes? What's going on? Yes? Come grab a bite. You brought your sheep already. Did get permission? It is empty anyway. Why should I ask for permission? Come on over. Take a seat. - Get your flock out of here! - Why? - Is it yours? - Yes, mine! It is not fucking yours. How can you talk to me like this. I am calling the cops right now! Go ahead. They are not picking up right? They never do. Because they can't. - Because there is no signal here. - Are you a nut job? Depends on who you talking to. Come again. I am always here. You have applied from here. I applied with my wife. Does her name come up in the system as well? Yes, two persons: Hasan Yilmaz, Emine Yilmaz. You applied for a double room, the cost is going to be a bit higher. - You know that, right? - Really, how much is it? 5500 USD per person. Around 30,000 in liras per person. Two people would make 60,000. I didn't think it would cost this much. It's because of the dollar exchange rate. - How much is a 3-4 person room? - You cannot change it at this point. The draw is held in the category according to registered preference. We cannot give up at this point I guess. Well, it's okay then. I am initiating the procedures now. You need to get a passport. You should do that with your wife. We can complete the rest of the procedures later. Bring your passport next week. There'll be trainings and meetings. - We'll let you know beforehand. - Thank you sir. My pleasure. Let your journey be a blessed one. - Amen. Have a good day. - Thanks. - Selam alaikum. - Alaikum salam. Welcome Auntie. Hello Hasan. - Hi. - Hi. How are you? Good? Good. What is this? It is a credit card. I brought it for your wife. Did she request one? Yeah. She asked me to bring it over. - Isn't she at home? - She's not. Does my wife have an account in your bank? No, the card will be tied to your account. Something like a joint credit card. Do I have a credit card? - No you don't. But... - So? How can you issue a joint one if there is none? No need for a joint card or anything else. I'm already upset and don't want to deal with you now. Here, take it back. By the way our bank's land interest rates have gone down. Now there's a 24-month payment plan. Last year's promotion is also going on. Interest-free on purchases of fertilizer and pesticides. I just wanted to remind you. Please close the door tight behind you, Halil. They raised the prices of pesticides this year. It was 5 liras cheaper per bag last year. I was planning to buy next year's pesticides in advance. But I ran out of money. How do you know what'll happen next year? What happens if the prices go down? True, but we always have to take precautions. Did you get rid of the tomato infection? Yes, I cleared it up. - It was a simple thing anyway. - Good, then. - Let me show you something. - What is it? I got my photograph taken today in the studio near city hall. For the passport. Is this really you? You look beautiful. - You also need to get yours taken. - Okay, I will. We didn't check the room prices when we registered ourselves. The prices have risen out of sight, all due to the rise in the dollar. I am not sure how we're going to be able to afford this. What do you mean? I don't get it. The hotel costs are soaring because USD exchange rate went up. I asked to change to group rooms to cut the cost, but they can't change it at this point. I can only fork out half the amount. Really? I didn't know we were short on cash. Well, that's the truth of it. The tomatoes didn't bring in enough to leave us a profit. So now the pilgrimage plan is on shaky ground. Are you kidding me? Not at all. Look here at the accounts book. You urged me to buy Seyfi's land and I did what you asked. Just give it to me. Now we can't even afford to go on the pilgrimage. So? Everyone is supposed to pay for his or her own pilgrimage. - Who said that? - The imam. I am not supposed to pay for your pilgrimage. True. The imam is right. Paying for your own is better. My sister advised me back then to finish school but I didn't listen. What are you saying? I could have worked and saved my own money. I wouldn't have needed your money. Well, all I'm saying is that it was the best-advised way. You or me, none of that matters when it comes to money. If we hadn't eloped I would've studied and learned a trade. I could even have gone to college. Did I put a gun to your head? You also wanted to elope. It was stupid of me. If I had followed my mother's advice and married Muhittin's daughter, Zeynep... half the town would be mine by now. I wonder who made the foolish choice? Just listen to what you are saying. I loved you and that's why. Well, same here. Then why would I have married you? So, why are you going on about this? I'll be back. - What happened? - Nothing. Are you all right, Emine? Am I all right... You took it. What? Hasan? Come on Hasan. Stop, stop. What's that tower for? They installed it recently. The power line is passing through here. You never told me. I completely forgot about it when the pilgrimage came up. Why did they put it on Muzaffer's land? I don't know. That was their decision apparently. Didn't you tell them that they shouldn't do that here? Why should I? You should be grateful that they didn't put it on our land. They cut down that giant tree. They say Muzaffer is very sick, Hasan. It's just hearsay. Don't believe it. I don't know. Supposedly he's cancer. Cancer? Please sign here Hadji Aunty. Here you go. - Where? - Here. - God bless. - Thank you, son. Is there anything else we should do? The procedures here are completed. Now you should start getting ready. Is there anything we need to buy? No, we will provide everything necessary. You can pick up your stuff from the office at the end of the hallway. You should prepare yourself spiritually for this journey. We're all human. We may have sinned intentionally or unintentionally. You shouldn't go on this journey if you have abused someone's rights. If you have to make up for something, try to do that. There will also be a training session about the pilgrimage rites. We will let you know. Let me give you these booklets and brochures. These have detailed information about everything. Here you go. Have a blessed journey. Please excuse us now. - Have a good day. - Have a good day. I don't owe anyone anything, thank God. Thank God. Do you? No. I don't have debts. Tell me if there is so we pay for it. Make sure there is nothing we missed. No. No. I don't have any. But we should ask for blessings out of neighbours and such. Maybe there are things we have forgotten. We should of course. We should also ask each other's forgiveness. Why is that? The thing about Berdush for instance. What happened to Berdush? I know what happened, Hasan. I know all about it. Go ahead. May God accept your prayers. May God accept your prayers. Hi, Hasan. How are you? I didn't see you inside. God bless you. - God bless you. - Have a good Friday. I missed you. I missed you too. I haven't been able to stop by for a long time. - I really feel embarrassed. - Why is that? Quite some time has passed since I bought a pair of boots. I spotted them when I was looking for something in the closet. When I bought them I didn't have the money on me... and you told me to pay you later. I forgot about it. - Let me pay for them now. - No need man. Probably I gave it to you as a gift. No way. Please take it and forgive me. Forgiven and forgotten. There was no need for it really. It's okay. I should've paid for it. We are going on a pilgrimage with my wife. Is that so? - May God accept your deeds. - Thanks. We've applied three years ago when my wife asked for it. And this year we were the lucky ones. We still haven't gotten the chance to apply. - Why not? - Well, I don't know. Ayse had a knee surgery, daughter's wedding, son's car. It's kismet. God willing you will also make the pilgrimage one day. Inshallah. Hope so. - You are size 44, right? - Now, now. You shouldn't. Why not? I am already embarrassed from the previous time. - It will be embarrassing again. - It's all good. And you are going on a blessed journey. Maybe I will also receive some blessings for it. - What do you think? - It's very good... - but you're embarrassing me again. - Stop it. Here. Godspeed, brother. May God accept your deeds there. By the way, pray for us as well. I will brother. I sure will. Thanks so much. Have a safe journey. Hasan, I didn't want to say it but I will now. - Don't say it. - I will say it anyway. You're going to ask your brother for his blessing, aren't you? I have no blessing to ask from him. He's the one who hasn't talked to me for 20 years. Whatever! You both are at fault. Whatever it is. It is over now. You should go and make amends, ask his blessing. The rest is up to him. I did not wrong him. He is the one who stopped talking to me. The judge decided how to divide the inheritance. Muzaffer didn't like the decision. - Did we seize the house and the land? - Of course not. It was the court's decision. Why should I go ask his blessing? I don't owe him a thing. No matter what, you are brothers and have rights over each other. Did he accept his own lot? I told him it's what the court has decided and I stayed out of it. Have you forgotten? He wanted to take over the house, orchard and the land for himself. And hand the cowshed to me... The court evenly distributed all of it and it was decided. Neither of us has a claim against the other. It's him that should be asking for my blessing. You are making me mad first thing in the morning, Emine! For goodness sake you go to Shoemaker Ismail, but not to your brother. Shame on you. How do you know where I went? If you are looking for your pants, I put them in the washer. If you ever go through my notes again, you will see what happens. Yeah, whatever. I just couldn't sleep. Why did you get up? I got up... and I just wanted to check on you. What are you writing? Nothing. A to-do-list. Otherwise I forget them. The dictionary tells us "tavaf" means circling, walking around something. In Islamic context it means circling around the Kaba. Starting from Hajar al-Aswad when you make a full circle, that's a shaft. Seven shafts is one tavaf. When you are making tavaf you also acknowledge that... everything circles around another thing... in this cosmic world and you are a part of it. Every time we pass Hajar al-Aswad, we raise our right hand and say "Bismillahi Allahu Akbar." This is our greeting to Hajar al-Aswad. Now let's start the tavaf. Those who are passing Hajar al-Aswad must please raise their hands... and say Bismillahi Allahu Akbar. We will do this in every lap. At every lap, we raise our hand and say... Bismillahi Allahu Akbar as we are passing Hajar al-Aswad. We thus do our greetings and then lower our hands. Kadir? - How can I help? - Hi. Hi. I'm from the Istanbul wholesale vegetable market. Just checking the produce. - Are you the keeper? - Yes. Where is the owner? - Over there. - That gentleman? - Right. - Okay. Hello Mr. Hasan. I'm Kerim. From Istanbul wholesale market. Fresh Veggies & Fruits. How are you? - Fine. Welcome. - Thanks. - Welcome. - Thank you. Your produce is very good. What are your asking prices? - Per crate? - Yes. 5, per crate. What are you saying, Mr. Hasan? It's too much. This is impossible. So, what's your offer? - 2, per crate. - Let's not waste each other's time. Your offer would make sense only if this was an export produce. It's not. It's not worth that much. Why wouldn't it be export produce? What's wrong with my tomatoes? They're sprayed with pesticides. That's not in line with EU standards. I have been examining this. See. Smell it yourself. Go ahead. EU says you can't send me produce with pesticide residue. They just return all the produce like that. Mr. Kerim, you know that we buy our pesticides from Europe anyway. True, but these tomatoes can only be sold domestically. I can pay you a maximum of 2.25. - No. 3 is my final offer. - No. It's too much. It's not doable. Its worth is 2.25. No more. We've invested a lot of money in this operation. Here is my business card. If you change your mind our truck is just over there. We will pick them up in three hours and everyone will be happy. Okay? - 3 is my final price. - No way. 2.25. Call me if you change your mind. - Thanks anyway. Have a good day. - Thanks. We sold them hardly for 1 last year. Why didn't you agree to his offer? Mind your own business! Who is he anyway? - Did you bring him over here? - Not me. He just saw the vegetables as he was driving past the field. Get back to work then. Not up to European standards? Who is producing this pesticide in the first place? It plainly writes "Made in Germany" in big block letters on each bottle. And then they say they're not in compliance with EU standards. You get back to work. - Hello Naim. - Hello Hasan. Hi, man. Come here. Come sit down. - God bless you. - Thanks a lot. - Please have some. - Thanks. What brought you here? I saw the truck and wanted to catch up. Early harvest, is it? Yeah, I sold off all my tomatoes and I'm done with it. - To export or to domestic market? - To the local market. If you don't mind me asking how much did you get? Naim... You know why I am asking? Somebody came up today. A middleman from Istanbul. What was it... Here. Fresh Veggies & Fruits. He asked for my tomatoes. I told him there's still time to the harvest. He insisted. We sold them for a lira a crate last year and regretted it. That's why I'm asking. I sold him, too. Don't worry. The price range is better this year. I started negotiating for 3 and sold off for 1.75. - That's your tomato? - Yes. Here. It's good stuff. - God bless you. - Thanks. Be quick about it. They say there'll be a lot of tomatoes this year. The prices go down when the weather gets warm. - I've got to go. - All right. - Do you remember my friend Turgut? - Yes, I do. - Is he still in Celtik village? - Yes, he is. Why do you ask? I want to see him about something. - I'll see you around. - See you. Thanks for stopping by. Is it you again? Will I never get a break from you? Nope, no break from me. Best if you get a break from yourself. What's up? Do you know where Turgut lives? Once you cross the bridge you'll spot an oak tree ahead. You'll find him in the coffee shop there, waiting for you. Waiting for me? And remember to pray for me in Mecca as well. Selam alaikum. What are you doing here? Is this the way to treat a guest? I am treating you the way you treated me. Is there something else you want to get from me? I came here to see how you are doing. So, what brings you here? You won't lift a finger if you don't have something to gain from it! Okay. Look we were both wrong. How was I wrong? You slandered me. I worked with you day in and out. And what did you do in return? You accused me of stealing from you. If I had known the truth I'd never have done that. I made a mistake. I worked with you for years. My family and I. Don't you know that I wouldn't do such a thing? You brought shame on our family for a few bucks worth of fertilizer. The seller gave us less than we paid for. But you wouldn't even listen to me. That's why I have come here. It's too late now. Too late. It's been five years. It no longer matters whether you come or go. It's now up to God to see after this matter in the hereafter. Turgut. I came here to ask for your blessing. I am going on the pilgrimage. Now, now... You will become a pilgrim? How pleasant! Go on the pilgrimage, come back clean as a whistle. But I will always remember what you have done to us. Stop being ungrateful. It was thanks to me that you have become a landowner. Everyone knows that. I helped you a lot. And don't forget it! You haven't changed a bit, Mr. Hasan. You always find something to rub it in. - But what you claim is just not true. - Shame on you. You think you have been generous, that you have helped me out. You like the idea of being that kind of person... the kind who helps people... who is considered to be a good man by others. But when you realize that one of the men you helped... saved penny by penny with his hard work and sweat... bought a plot of land in his village. Then there is no need to show him any compassion. Just brand him a thief. Just leave, okay? I give you my blessing, but this matter doesn't end with me. Only God can forgive your sin! - Let's tie it up with the string. - Okay. - Hold it tight. - Okay. Shall I come as well? No need. It's better that I go by myself. Give them my regards. Alaikum selam. Muzaffer. Muzaffer. Hasan. What brought you here? I brought you some apples. Has something happened? Are you alright? Yes we are. How are you doing? Well, so so. Why are you here? Is my brother home? He was here a minute ago. He must be out in the garden. We are going on the pilgrimage next week. We hadn't heard about it. I am so happy for you. How is Emine? The kids? They are all good. Thanks God. Why didn't you bring Emine? She is preparing for the journey. She plans to drop by before we leave. You shouldn't have bothered. Let me take this to my brother. Brother. Selam alaikum. How are you? Are you okay? Why are you here? What do you want? I have come to see you brother. Who are you? I am Hasan. Don't you recognize me? My! What brought you here? My goodness. Dear Lord. Would you look at that. Dear Lord. Look here! Hasan, my friend from military service has come to visit. - No brother, not from the Military. - It has been ages Hasan. But you haven't changed a bit. How are you? Are you okay? I'm okay brother. Come let me show you around. Did he really not recognize me? He is getting worse. Sometimes he doesn't even remember who we are. How long has he been like this? It's been two years. Come here my friend. I'm gonna show you something. Are we going to Kizilcakaya brother? How do you know about that place? We used to play hunting with you there. You remember? We would climb up the tree to look for twigs to make into slingshots. Brother, I came to ask for your blessings. Whose blessings? Your blessings. I am going on the pilgrimage. Who were you again? I can't make out who you are. I am your brother, Hasan. Hasan. What are you looking for, brother? There used to be a tree that my grandpa planted right here. That tree was in a different place. Where are we? Why are you crying, my friend? Don't cry. It is not worth it. Not worth it.
