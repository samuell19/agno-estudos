You say Mary makes you... a nice pineapple jam? - Very nice. - What does she use for sugar? We drink our daily ration of 2 teas without sugar. That's all. And for pineapple? Mary replaces it with pickles. Stop! A German! Quick! The problem is that the color... is not quite the same. And because of The acidity of the pickles... we need more sugar. But you could be fooled. But why can't you say... it's pickle jam? Because Mary and I... we prefer pineapple jam. Of course. Let's go. Number 2! Off the field! You're here for Lieutenant Jeff Mitchum? Orderly! Accompany these gentlemen. Follow me. His nose is in pretty bad shape. War? Rugby. Does he play scrum-half? Referee. And it's Jeff that... Yes. Excuse me. Shit! Some visitors for you. All right. I'm coming. Quick! Hurry! Bye! Careful children. His Grace is waiting. Please... Your Grace? Here you are. Leave us. Come closer. Let me... So, feeling happy? Yes. I scored three tries. And sent a fourth referee to hospital! In five games! The try he refused was good! I'm sure! Yes me too. There was no pass forward! The referee was your Wing Commander. Not on the field! You will present your excuses. Tonight. I hope tonight... we will be in Normandy... to raid the Germans. Ah yes. Go kiss your mother. But... Saturday on the field... try to behave like a gentleman. And I'll handle... the referee. Fine. Thanks. So, I have your word? Whatever happens... next Saturday... you'll be on the field! Next Saturday. Goodbye, papa. Atlantic Wall Target on visual. Stay in tight formation. Target on visual. Continue in tight formation. Attention all squadrons. Sir, the try I scored was valid. Convert it! All right... Anybody there? Oh. poor Liquorice-mint. They left you alone? Anybody there? Papa? Aunt Maria? Are you upstairs? Come here, Liquorice-mint! Are you crazy!? Turn off the light! Maria! You can come out it's Juliette. Goodnight papa and Maria. What are you doing in there? And you? You left for 15 days... and you're back during an alert! Where were you? At grandpa's. Even more boring than you are. But if I bother you I'll leave. Those two they always squabble. Come on, kiss your father. If they could shoot one down! Papa! shame on you... Achtung! Boom! Wonderful... Get down! Shit! What happened? Anybody hurt? Bring the light over I'll finish eating. You can come out. There's customers. Hey Leon. Nice treat from the Roastbeef. Bastards! My chandelier. The last gift from my wedding! 20 years your wife left you. No need to make that fuss! Easy for you to say... And you? What do you want? To go through your garden. Krauts are after us. Very bad timing! We've work to do! Work? A hell of a job to do! At this hour? When collaborators snore... resistance is at work. Yeah, mentioning no names... You're saying that for me? Hush, don't provoke them. Shit! Krauts! Maria switch off the light! And you get out. I don't want trouble. We'll remember that! Chicken! Collaborator! Very clever! They are underground! Everybody knows that! What could I do? Good night. Enough fun, I'm going to bed. Tonight don't use the bathroom. I've put things in it... and the wardrobe is blocking the door. You understand? It's over. Come over to the square! Get off! Search the houses! Maybe a piece of the chimney fell off? Lights on? Yeah. If we kill him it's tonight or never. But we never did that? Let's do it! Then forget about it. Is it bloody? Shit! Krauts! A Feldgendarme!! Wait, I'll free you. There. Go away. Gedeon! There's a car in the shop! A car? The window! Savages! And there's another on the roof. On our roof? Of course not! In the street. It's Armand and his Kraut Totor. Help me! Steinbichler? Nothing broken? Come... Nothing like this ever happened to me before! Show me. Why did you drive so far off? Because of the calf. What calf? Yes! There was a calf there! Why did you drive so fast?! Because of the Englishman. What Englishman? I've seen a calf but no Englishman. Yes, sergeant... we're looking for an English pilot! A terrorist! When they are drunk they see... calves and Englishmen everywhere! Thanks buddy! Now, every man for himself. Now get the car... - To Monsieur Armand's house. - Yes, sir! You good-for-nothing! All right? Does it hurt? Help me turn the car over. Come on, get going! Come on! Ah, it's nice to come back home. What a day! No need for a lullaby. My head... What a mess! My head... Armand... look! Inform all units! Steinbichler... yes! Now get the car... yes! Not here! Over there! Give me the keys! I'm gonna keep them. Terrorist! Let's go! Come with me! You go left, you go right. Keep searching! We have to find him! Don't shoot! Search... search, don't shoot! You come with me, you go to the right! Behind the monument I said! Who's shooting there? Look there! Hurry up! Follow me! He went down the alley! Look everywhere! Come on, hurry up! Look in here! Examine everything! Nobody's here... so go on! It's a cat. You can go on. Gather in the square... at the monument. Thanks. Liquorice-mint? At last you're back home. Are you hungry? Little rascal! Come. It will be a feast. There would be trouble if papa could see us... I'm an Englishman. Not German. Look. RAF. Plane. Boom. Englishman. Churchill. Liquorice-mint! I don't like sardines. But I love Cognac! They knock like morons... No light. See. Kaput. You're hiding an English airman. Terrorist! No Englishmen here... after what they did to me! Where is he? Tell him in German. English here not! Search everywhere. - Here's my friend. - The calf? Nobody's here, Corporal! - This way! - Yes. They'll come upstairs. Shoot without warning! Big Rascal! Black market! So-so... Forbidden! You would get us shot for a calf! But I don't know this calf! Either, at this instant... my son is in Heaven. Poor Jeff. Or... Saturday he will be... on the field! They are nervous. At the railroad station they... searched my suitcase 3 times! Really? Safe journey, I'm out of here. Guys! It stinks up there. I don't care. - What did you see? - Nothing. Damn it, the calf didn't fly! It's the fourth time! Silence! An English airman can't fit in there... Paris! Filthy swine! This is also swine! Forbidden! - Our blood-sausage! - We need the calf! It was seen down the street. Maybe at Leon's? Not the right time! Look! Armand and his two Krauts... My head! Leon will offer an aperitif! My god! Are you hurt? We bent down together to pick you a four-leaf clover... and look at the result! - Quick something to drink. - Right away Mr Friedrich. Where is Leon? You know... busy with his little things. Let's trick Leon! I know where he hides... his little things. There, you'll feel better... German police! Open the door! Big rascal! Trafficker! It's your friend Friedr... You ate all that!? Miss Juliette? Are you back home? Yes. - Open for me. - I can't. - Why? - I'm naked. Even better. Who's that guy? A German. Papa's friend. A German? What is he doing? I don't know. He left. Maybe it's a trick! I'll check. No, not like that. Careful. All clear. Why did you say you hate Germans? I thought you were up there. No noise, Juliette is back you know. She must not have slept much. Poor girl. Of course, with last night events. Did you see my ceiling? And theirs!? What happened to you two. It was the Englishman. He was hiding at my place. No kidding! Look at the proof! There! He knocked us down, Steinbichler and I. From behind. You know what with? My own African club! That could have been painful! But it was! I only needed 3 stitches, him 12! 12 stitches! Luckily he is strong headed... What a mighty blow! I haven't seen that since 1933 in Africa. There, to your health! Cheers. See you tonight, Leon. There you are! Where is your boss Charlus? He was supposed to start at 8 o'clock. My window will never be finished! Where is he? In bed, with jaundice. Jaundice!? You're kidding me? He looks Chinese. Eyes and all. Really, more yellow than that! I can't believe it! A painter with jaundice! He did it on purpose, right? Who will finish my window? Look at mine, look! And a lonely woman with that. Coming! I must go! He's been like that since last night. For each car that passes by he goes crazy. - Angele? - Yeah!!! Buttercup... Charlus Buttercup. Mr Charlus... come to the Kommandantur. Quick! It's a mistake, let me explain... Take all your stuff... samples... and come quickly to the Kommandantur. Me no Charlus me! Charlus, jaundice. Yellow. Yellow, like that. Buttercup. What buttercup... Sabotage! Who do you think you are?! Do you wanna make fun of us? Get out, quickly! Take everything... hurry up! Get moving! Get in the car! What impudence! Where is he going? Ah, this one... Collaborator! Yeah!!! For Colonel Muller. HEIA SAFARI! Your idea? Yes. You knew them all from Libya. Thanks comrades, thanks. The African sun... The good old days. It's nice here... you'll get used to it. Less sweat... more drinks! Colonel! The painter is here. Room 3. Let him wait. Then bring him upstairs to my office. Do you still like Benedictine? It still exists? For me, yes. I know an innkeeper... like that! No. Forbidden! My friend Friedrich... he'll explain... Me innkeeper. My friend Friedrich... he'll explain... No, not this one... This one! What does that mean? Since this morning... you are Feldmarschall Rommel's driver. HEIA SAFARI! There's bombing? We didn't hear an alarm... Is Juliette skipping rope? At her age! Oh! My tripe! She's crazy! Please go sit there. Shit... what a mess! She's absolutely crazy! - Yes aunt? - What are you doing? Just cleaning my room. What a racket! Do you want me to come? No, I've just finished. Come, help me! Why did you bring this? For you, to sleep. I cannot sleep! I must be in Twickenham... Saturday, at 3 p.m. Impossible! I promised my father. Why? For that... No more headache? See! I knew there was some bombing! True. Foie gras bombing. I am really sorry... for this misunderstanding. Don't mention it. Friedrich said I could count on you. Right, but I'm not a painter. Even if you're not a painter by trade, please don't let me down! Look at those walls... my Feldmarschall would not like that! Mr Charlus is sick... so you'll help me. Yes, you'll help me. And Friedrich told you... That you're the right man for any job! You flatter me but... Come in. Colonel, the documents... Yeah, I know. Put them over there. Can you roll it out? Please, sorry... There's another 'piss off papeer'... Thanks a lot. - Did you get your orders? - Not yet. I'm going to dictate them personally. Sorry, one second... To Lieutenant-Corporal Haberkorn... Underline: Top Secret! The orders I'm giving to you... This'll keep you busy, hey... Mr. Duchemin. What do you think of this one. Buttercup. Very nice. Cheerful. The Feldmarschall will like that. You know, African sun, sand... Come in. The first sample. Yes, the English airman. Something wrong Mr Duchemin? Yes, an S is missing there. 'will by shot using firearms' There's more than one firearm. So you need an S. You're right! S! Correct that immediately! You see Mr Duchemin... you're the right man for any job! So, Buttercup. Tomorrow morning. With your tools. My office will be empty. Your samples... and the piss off papeer! Tomorrow morning. Sharp. Ok. Thanks Juliette. Is he respectable? His father is a Bishop. Bishop? What a shame! - My mother was very pious. Oh!? Really? It's your father. Forgive me. I can't believe I did that. What happened to you? Just that! What's that? I have no idea! But this means 'Top Secret'. Put it back where you took it. How could I? Should I say to them... 'I just picked it by mistake'. Just explain it calmly. For them it's important... for others it means nothing. You're talking nonsense! Imagine you're an English officer... and someone brings you something... 'Top Secret'. So what? It could change the whole war! Then you'd receive a medal from Churchill... and the King would make you a Baronet! - Come! - Where? - In the Attic. - What for? - To see him. - Who? The Englishman the King will make a Baronet! What? Jeff, this is my father. He speaks a little English. But, where does this one came from? A plane. A plane? Yes. No that plane that.. The Englishman who... Yes it was me. Oh no, I can't believe it... What did I do to God this morning? No blasphemy Sir. My father would not like that. His father is a Bishop. A Bishop? How did he come here? Through your daughter's room. Who's there? So? Nothing in the garden! We must find this damn calf! Maybe Leon snitched it! Look in the basement I'll be on the lookout. Watch out! Armand and his two Krauts. Quick! Krauts!! Me know London, see. I was a cook. At Prunier, big restaurant. What does he say? He says it's fantastic. I must bring this to London! He's going crazy! Tell him Germans are here. He knows, he killed some. With your jacket it's safe. He cannot go outside... they're asking for papers. Now what! What does he want? Wonderful, isn't it? But he is crazy! Where are you going? Saturday I must be in Twickenham. You know what will happen... if you are caught? No. We'll all get bumped off! My daughter and my... All right, go there. And keep your nose clean. Lucky you! As usual the father... is the last one to know. But a Feldgendarme... she deserved much better! What are you doing here! Nothing. Just passing through. Don't bother I'm leaving. No no, it's my round. What about a pre-war Cotes du Rhone? Sit down I'm coming. Good customers. One moment, I'll send Maria. Know who's here? - Hippolyte and his gang. - The resistance? Bring a bottle of Cotes du Rhone. You. Put that on. Why? It's O.K? Not any more. Juliette explain to him. And bring him to Hippolyte. I'll be back soon. I found two bottles of Benedictine. That's what I wanted! Tonight I must celebrate. What? I've just been promoted... Feldmarschall Rommel's driver. Imagine that! Come. Ah, Juliette... Love, hey? Excuse me. No no, me first. Of course. It's them, there. Hey! The Feldgendarme! The calf! The Englishman. Sorry! Here you go, Mr Totor. Steinbichler. No he's not a Feldgendarme. He's the English airman everyone is after. A relative? A distant cousin. Ah yes. I knew I'd seen him before... Thanks Leon. No no, through the garden! My customers shouldn't see that! What should I do? They don't believe me. I'll handle that. Go outside and if someone comes... knock on the window. Hi Armand. Hi Leon. You're not drinking? Is my wine corked? Guys. When my fridge is broken... I call the electrician. And when I have an English airman... I call the resistance fighters! Stop thinking and take him right now. Saturday he must be in London. Yes. At 3 p.m. Figure it out! What again!? Where did you find that!? In the thingies. See... I pulled the handle and... I got that on the head. No idea what this is. It's nothing. Just paper for... Let me offer you a drink. The paper... You know what this is? A Krauts secret weapon! I stole it this morning... at the Kommandantur. Now it's your turn! I'll deliver: the guy, and the map! Stand up! German police! Papers! Come on now, stop it. Cut the crap! That's my friend! What is that nonsense? He's a swell guy. Careful you. Don't understand! - Papers? - All clear! Let's go! Excuse us. Bye Leon. We have work to do. What's happening? We'll be back. And the map? Where's the map? I saw you hiding it. You seem familiar. True. And I saw stars. Oh, sorry! And him? I owe him one. Poor Totor. I presume you want to go to England? Alas, I must be in Twickenham Saturday. Yes. At 3 p.m.! I hope you enjoyed you stay in France? Excellent. My father will gladly... welcome you in England. The Bishop? Surely one day I'll come. Please get in. No time to lose. Good bye. Safe journey. Thanks! Where is Armand? I must go back home. - Shut up! - What? You're alone boss? Yes, Marchand cannot leave. - What happened? - Gestapo. - And the Englishman? - On the boat. Hey you! Stay alert! Leon? Ah, there you are. Take that. Give that to Jeff. It's from Juliette. Everything all right? Take that, it's from Juliette. Oh, so lovely. Who? My daughter? No, the Cognac! All right, bye. A convoy! Cast off the boat. Quick! Wait wait! I shouldn't leave! What are you doing? The machine gun! Hell! What would I do in London? Sit down. We're not in England yet! What a mess... What's that? Krauts? What!? Halt! Hands up or I open fire! Papers. Are you mad? Guards back on the boat! Quick! Now we're really in it! Don't be sad, Mr Leon. England is beautiful. I know. A bit faster! - The game starts at 3:30 p.m! - We'll be there early! Come on Jeff. Come on my boy! Convert it Jeff! Did you see my son? That's the second time. One more and you're out! - Turn around! - (see papa?) - Number 2! - (he does it again) This man is an excellent airman, but a very poor referee. That's war. Pass forward! Shit! No! Me! He is mad! Your eye feels better? Yes your grace. A spy, me? I've been interrogated for 8 months. Moved around... Treated like a criminal. It is too much. True, you complain too much. That's not what I mean. Good. The cook is expecting you. The cook!? You don't like hats? A lot Sir. That's the kitchen. From Commandant Perry. I know. Right away. Come back in 10 minutes. What are you waiting for? Go and serve tea... you are almost late. Do you know what was in the hatbox? No less than dynamite! No, a head. A man's head. Isn't it? Perry made is severed... by our surgeon... from a German gunner's body... killed by a parachute fall... in Yorkshire. What fun is there in doing that? Tonight he must interrogate... the stubborn pilot... who thinks that his comrade... is prisoner too. Perry thinks... that opening the hatbox... will give him... a psychological shock. Charming. No, fearsome. How much did the German pay you... to deliver this location map... from a so-called secret weapon? Nothing! I told you a hundred times! 27 times, exactly! You have been confronted... 6 times with the fisherman... 8 times with the RAF Sergeant. All stories match. Of course they match. It's the truth. Truth never matches... when you have nothing to hide. Never! Tea? Yes please. So you're all crazy? I save one of your airman... wanted by the whole German army. I stole, risking my own life... a top secret military document. And I managed to... bring it all back to the Allies. So, I really think that... I would at least deserve... say... the Victoria Cross. At least. Because... England is a free country. You can do anything, tell anything. Even during wartime. Except... spill tea when it is rationed. Good! There's enough ice? No, put it there. We received new photographs. Interesting? I hope so. I'm coming. This will gives you... a few minutes to think. my mind is made up. So, did you think about it? Oh yes... I'll tell you everything. 7-W-H. Oeuf-en-Tardenois. That's here. Exactly. It's the third point. No need for more trouble gentlemen. The little Frenchman collapsed. No reason. German brainwashing. That map is a fraud. No Sir, not the map. Absolutely positive, look. And those things looking like ski... are really matching those map drawings? Exactly the same position? So it was all true... This little Frenchman really got us... the plans for a German secret weapon. And I've lost 8 months... trying to make him confess... the exact opposite. During the other war... I would have shot myself. Bring whisky for everybody. The RAF will seriously look... after those ski thingies. Come, Mr Duchemin. Now I have confessed it all... maybe I could return to prison? Mr Duchemin... you are a liar! This map is genuine. This document is priceless. Standing in front of you... is the author of the most... fantastic achievement... of World War II. This is why we hesitated before shooting him! When one is innocent... one doesn't stay in prison... without protesting! And on top of it... one doesn't confess! Didn't you say that... Feldmarschall Rommel's driver... is your friend? You said that many times. So-so. We have a very important... assignment for you. Me? You! You will go through... special training. Very tough. After that we will... parachute you into France. Me? You! I refuse. Very well. Then I'll certify this map is a fraud... that you brought just to fool the Allies. And you will be tried by a court-martial. That's disgusting. I mean... that's monstrous! Positively. A whisky and you'll feel better. If I can say something... you are doing a really bad job. Because if you don't trust me... who says that back in France... I will not tell everything to the Germans? But a double agent never travels alone. He goes with somebody. And... I do have an idea. His orders will be to kill you... if you do anything suspicious. Gentlemen, let's toast to... dear Mr Duchemin. What are you waiting for? It's the recruit, Sir. I can see that. Oh! Jeff! Go join the others. You bastard. Dismiss! Attention. We shoot with real bullets. Bloody stupid! I'll be all dirty. Move on! I can't... I'm stuck. It is imperative that those two... hate each other as quickly as possible. Move on! Easy to say. If I had known... Shit! I rely on you. Go! And me, I... I don't know either! Paratroopers. Climb up there. And if he hesitates... push him. This Duchemin needs to be broken. No worries Colonel. Head down! Round shoulders! Clench elbows! Bend knees! Look the ground! Jump! Attention! At ease! But I didn't... I didn't ask for all this! Mind your manners! Is there a scaled-down model? Pretty high up, eh? Climb! Swine! Isn't that enough? Shoot! He'll jump? Absolutely. Jump, or I shoot! Why are you doing all that? Push him! I'm scared! All right? Did I arrive? Up! Up, up... Again! No, it was all right so don't push it. First day of spring. You really have a spring here? There, look. Me? See? Hi. To my father's place. Only one girl in the camp... and she's for that bastard. And the stripes? My father is here? Yes his grace is waiting for you. What's happening! You asked for me? A serious matter? No. Do you remember this picture? Of course it's me when... I was say, 3 months old. More or less. And... this one? This one? Yes. Yes, the same. Look closer. Didn't you forget something... in Normandy? What are you doing on my hood? Sybil. Well I never! Did I hurt you? Careful with my cap! You broke my leg! This one too! I'm feeling better already. Job done. I'll take you to the hospital. I can't be left alone in such a state. Your place is very nice. Better than the hospital. You really feel better? Yes, I feel better, really. With that you'll feel perfect. Thanks. I'm laughing because... if Jeff could see me... Why Jeff? Don't know. I figured that... you two... Oh no, not my type at all. Me neither! I hate him. Too bad... because... you must go back to him. No, really... I can't move at all. At least... not before morning. And me? Where will I sleep? You just have to make the best of things. Dear Sybil, I love you. Since that night my life has changed. There! So! Born in Sainte-Mere-Eglise, right? - Yes. - First girlfriend was named... Lolotte. And she had curly hair. French resistance hero... then attending... a secret agent training... with an instructor... who is a swine! More? If I transmit this report... to Field Marshal Perry... tomorrow your head... is on his desk... in a hatbox! Look at that. Violets... No, it's not for you. You have no rights! It's private. You didn't hurt her I hope? Who? Sybil. Tonight... Sergeant Poteski. The Polish? Yes. That's war. Wait... Gentlemen, you will be dropped in London... without money or papers. And you have 2 hours to get back here. It's your last test. Excuse me Sir... Poteski. Is this money yours? Yes. Why? Duchemin. 1 pound, 4 shillings. No luck. No money? No papers? No London map? Right. Off you go. Pick it up! Faster. For you it's over. You. No money, no papers, no London map. Nothing in the hands, nor in the pockets! The Tower of London, Tower Bridge... all my youth! Take him back to camp. I'm going to watch this clown. I'm sure he is up to something... Me French. Meeting at Prunier... with General De Gaulle. You know him? Big fella. Doesn't matter. Me strait and... concerned because... this guy there... he follows me always. He makes me indecent proposals. See what I mean? Watch him! Thanks! Restaurant Prunier. What? Homosexual? What? He accosted a man? Put him through. I followed your orders Sir. What! Oh, Duchemin. Listen. Return the situation to normal... or it's court-martial! Right away Sir. With respect. We offer our apologies Sir. Can I do something for you Sir? No! Yes! Repeat what this Frenchman told you. Word for word! He said... So and your wife? She's not back yet. That's 20 years now. Not even a postcard. I'm starting to have some doubts. There, have a shot of white wine. You're here since when? One year. And you visit us only today! What where you doing? I was in jail. But in less than half an hour... as I will not be back to the camp... they'll fire me... then I'll be free. So if you want me back... I didn't lose my touch you know! Come. Have a look! I'll make your sauce... - Good old Leonne. - Not Leonne, Leon! Yes Leonne. He didn't make any progress, right? There. Thanks! It's for Churchill table. I serve him myself! Take that. We celebrate the... Prime Minister's birthday. Sorry. Hide me guys! Let me through! Didn't you see... a Frenchman? Mr Duchemin. How are you? No need. The test is over. Let them come in. Come in. What are you waiting for? - There's only one Sir. - What? He seems to be a bit tired. But he's out cold!? Not at his best to embark tomorrow evening! Good luck Sir! I'll hope you'll keep... a pleasant souvenir from England. I'll remember it! But I'm not leaving alone... there's someone else. Inside! Sit Mr Duchemin. I will not leave with this lout! No chance! You want some more... like yesterday? What!? Go ahead, try me... Here's the other one. Go! Put out the fire! - All right Armand? - Yes. - Leon OK? - He was drifting back there. 4 men are searching for him. Anyway... he's home here. He must not be left alone. He is quite nervous. - You see if they find him. - OK. And bring him where we agreed. Give that to Leon, it's for Juliette. I'm worried about Leon. Maybe I pushed him a bit too hard. Guys? And Leon? Nothing. Not even a piece of parachute. He didn't go back up right? Where could he be! Follow me. You better go back. If there's trouble we can always say... we're on duty. But where is he? They didn't get me! To the right! Are you crazy? Go back! Everyone is after you! Are you completely mad? Don't be a fool! We've been searching for you for 3 hours... afraid you were caught. - Who told you? - Armand. What business is it of his? Where are we going? Simple. We're taking you home. Between two gendarmes? You left for a year... we need a good reason. Black market, one year in jail. Your sister said she had no news. Your coming will cause a stir. You bet! Particularly with those. Very funny. Now everybody will think I'm a trafficker. Damn right! That's what it takes. You'll also collaborate with Germans. Do you see what you're making me do? After the war the English will shoot me. But you are working for the English! And the resistance? Did you think about that? - The resistance? - It's us! What's that? No idea. Jeff gave it for Juliette. Shit! Leon! Juliette, your father! Come, let's not stay outside. Maria, come at once. I'll go and tell Hippolyte and Albert. Smells good. You changed the wallpaper. Good job on the window. Thanks. Better than jail right? And better than tea! You drank tea in jail? They have some in the free zone. And he must check in? Every Friday. What was that all about? I don't know. A crazy idea. I took the train to Moulin from Paris... then I bought half a pig... flint stones, colza oil, etc. And all that to run into two bozos... dressed just like these. Crazy, right? Liquorice-mint did that? Yep. It's Spring. See you Friday Leon? Right. Friday. Guys, circus is in town. What's that? A baby. I can see that. But who's the owner? Do you want to know... the father or grand father's name? Because the grand father, it's you. What? Juliette is married? Married! No need to be dramatic. How's that? She is not married and I am a grand father? - But it only means that... - Yeah, yeah... Who is he? I would like to know who's the bastard? Bring him and I'll smash his face! He's not here papa. How's that? He left. Where is he? I don't know papa. It's Jeff. There's trouble brewing. What does he bring back? Bastard! He didn't tell me. And he knew it! It's Jeff. Where is he? I wish I knew. We must find him papa. Leave that to me, I will. And you... you're not my daughter. You disgraced me. Do you think it's the day to talk like that? After coming between two gendarmes! Everybody's looking! At least smile to this boy. What's his name? Like me? Yes papa, I wanted it. That's kind of you. Come... You're a good girl. So... what do you say to grandpa? Take him just a second... So guys... you don't like my grandson? We wanted to congratulate you. We couldn't find the father, see? Then, congratulate me. Where's the other one. Don't be a fool Leon! How do you want it? Door or Window? Not me! Your grandson is handsome! Out, I'll kick your ass! Lousy resistance fighters! You'll be back in jail soon. Count on that! - Collaborator! - Bastard! Did you see grandpa? That's not a way to treat customers! I don't know, must be jail time. I lose my temper for nothing. - You're not sending me to jail? - We are. They are crazy. Now they think they are real gendarmes. Surely you don't believe the gossip... of those lousy resistance fighters? Yes, it's perfect they filed a complaint. Is it higher? No, almost there. Jojo, did you sleep off the booze? - Look! A newcomer. - I don't know him. I've seen this face before... A nice surprise for you. How are you? Remove that right now. And close the door. Better leave them. They need to talk. I was bored without you. Are you crazy? Bastards! They beat up the newcomer. What a racket your customers are making! Maybe they don't see very well. Yeah, right. Do you want some light? Looks like they had a fight. You got this one all right. You didn't lost your touch. Better not bother me. Let's not fight. Tomorrow the war is over... I'll marry Juliette... and you become... how do you say that... my papa in love! Papa in love? You must be dreaming! Me your father in law, never! After all you did to me... let alone to my daughter! I will never forget! Nor will she! You lout! Damn sons of Bishops! They're back in business. They killed him? Who knows with those creeps. Who's the moron that shut off the light. Wait. Come here. Settle down, papa in love. I only wanted to explain... Have another one. And you'll understand everything. You're a monster. You destroyed my life. I did all that... to see again Juliette... and my baby. Go away! You disgraced my daughter. Bastard! I'll marry her! I discussed the matter with papa. The Bishop? And what does he say? He blessed us! He convinced me... to accept this assignment. The assignment was... for you to come... and marry Juliette? - Yes. - That's very kind. So what's the assignment? Kill Rommel. What? I refuse. Guys! Look what they did to Leon. Cops are not that bad after all. Look! So what? It's Rommel's car. Get the hell out of here! Leon, come quick! - Is he here? - You bet! He drank half a bottle of Benedictine! Rommel? Of course not Rommel! Friedrich. He came here for your return. You gave him a going over! He can't hold his liquor! One year in jail can destroy a man! So, you say, Muller... Dead! Why did they do that to him? He lost a very important document. You know Leon... 'Ich liebe dich' Yes! I love you. But your daughter even more. No, not again... First of all, my daughter... is not respectable. Doesn't matter. I marry! I recognize little Leon. No, impossible. Why? You would be my loving papa. And if they send you to the Russian front? I'll write every day to Juliette... like the Feldmarschall to Lou. She's his wife. He loves her you know. He loves her as much as I love Juliette. Nothing is too good... just to please Lou. There, there! You know what you should do? Find me a pair of shoes, size 38... made out of antelope. - Ante-what? Loup? You're the lout! There I told him. Yes! Antelout! Christ! It's for Lou's birthday. If you find that for me... the Feldmarschall will return to Germany... and I'll have one more stripe. And all that for... a pair of shoes? Yes! That's love! And when is the Feldmarschall coming? The day after tomorrow! To the Feldmarschall! HEIA SAFARI! I saw you. Shame on you! Get drunk like that! You're right. It's terrible. What? What I've just heard about. Why? I don't know what to do. I still have real coffee. Want some? No! Don't drown yourself! Shut up! Let me deal with your cruiser! I've just seen Friedrich... Hi! La la la! Totor Totoooor! Totor is cheating! Primitive! Canibal! Shame on you! Shut up! G-what ? G-9 Sod all! E-3 Cruiser kaput! I'm sinking what's left of the German fleet! Pastis, Leon? - Stop drinking and play! - (Rommel...) (coming in 2 days...) When? (coming...) You make signs! Cheaters! Both of you! I've seen '2'. Big rascal! Outside! Quick! Leon the spy! '2' hey? Leon Kaput! What's that? A Dorcas gazelle. Does it have another name? Antelope. Africa. That's an antelope? Same family, yes. You're kidding me! Why does he laugh? Look at him! An antelope? Very well... We are the same size. Yes. I'm tall for a Norman. Can I try your cap? Are you thirsty? Here's Leon. My darling! What a day! Now you're less drunk... and we are alone. What are you plotting? I've found a way, but... Too late! We are closed! It is Armand. What does he want again! What's up? We must talk. It's serious. - Is he here? - Who? Yes, keep your... All right, I understand... Jeff escaped from jail... knocking out the guard. We must find him. London order. Do you know a 'Perry'? You bet! He thanks you for the tip. Rommel will be killed in 2 days. Whatever the cost. Where's Jeff!! But I don't know where he is! The Baronet from last year... is back! No, not again! And you, really! You frighten little Leon. Sorry for the guard. Let's talk openly as you're here. Rommel arrives the day after tomorrow. Where? How? I grilled Totor a bit. Only one place seems suitable... but you must get in. Why looking at me? Because you know the place. It's Muller's office. Me I... Please sit papa in love. Now it's my job. We need to get in. Impossible. Even more so for you. We must get in! But we need a good reason. I don't know we could bring... a thing or some furniture... swap something. Can't you remember a thing? On the desk? Or the wall? On the wall there's the portrait of... Yes! But what do you want to do with it? It's not for me it's for a friend. - A friend? - Yes. You're going to Paris for Rommel... surely you can bring it back for me? When I give you sardines... I don't ask what you do with them. All right! And you, remember my shoes? More than ever. I already spotted the antelope. Thief! Catch the thief! Fuck! A fine beast. We don't find that around. Can you make a pair of shoes out of it? One can always try. But they won't last long. I don't give a damn! But I need them tomorrow morning. Tomorrow morning... well... Well what? One can always try. Hide that! Bring the sardines! I didn't ask for life-sized! I will draw attention with that. I couldn't find a bigger one! This time, we must act! Watch out! Savages! And were is the other one? Maria, what's the time? Why do you ask every 5 minutes? Come for a schnapps? Sounds great, I'm with you in a second! Did you find your cap? No. My cap... my cap... Hello. What's that? Antelope! He is grumpy because... he lost his cap. Come for a schnapps. Sit there. - I lost it... - Here's your cap! See, it was right there. Since his bump on the head... Cheers! Something is fishy. Yesterday my antelope. Today his cap. - Let's go. - Wait! There's no rush. No, but there's Rommel. Come. If we don't deliver the car... we will be stuck at the Kommandantur... until the end of the inspection. See you tonight at Leon's. No alcohol! Wonderful! You haven't lost your touch. Offer him a drink, he deserves it. Sorry but, I must go outside. There. Help yourself. What's that? Antelope. Could be, but also women shoes. Maybe it's your birthday? I was born in April. No regrets. After the next rain... only shoelaces and soles will be left. Bye. Where are you going? A quick delivery, only 15 minutes. There's a woman in your life! But you know I only had one. And she left with my best cook so... And that? That's for Friedrich! I must take it immediately... or Jeff will do something stupid.... and I want to keep a father... for my little Leon. I know... all that looks silly but it is serious. I can't explain. Tell Armand I'm at the Kommandantur. He must do nothing. I'll have a good surprise. - You'll remember? - I'll try. And prevent the other one to get out! He must not leave the place! Even if he makes another baby! What's in there? Shit... What do you think?! Uniforms! - Coats and boots! - Alright. You may pass. Go on! - Where is Leon? - Out for 5 minutes. I told him to wait here! He too asked you to wait here. - He'll have a surprise. - Where did he go? At the Kommandantur. Are you sure? Yes and I know what's for Friedrich... A pair of antelope shoes. - Damn it! - What? It's a disaster! I was here for you all... Leon, you, Juliette and the child. If we fail you all risk your lives. The guy outside... will bring you to safety. I'll take care. Quick grab your stuff. What are you two doing here? We wait for Jeff. He went inside Totor's truck. Easy. Your future son-in-law has some guts! No worries. Rommel is here at 7 p.m. 10 minutes later, everything blows up. - And Jeff? - See the window? We cut the bars. He just pushes and goes. If he is not killed! No way I must go. Come back. There's no time! Antelope shoes. Quick. Thanks. - Get out! Quickly! - I know a lot of people. This is for Feldmarschall Rommel. Well, for his wife. Me speak Lieutenant Friedrich. Driver. - Friedrich is not here. - And Totor? Who is Totor? Ah Totor... what's his name again... Bang on his big head of... Ah yes! Steinbichler. No, not here. There. Careful! Listen Jeff. I know you're here. No need to kill Rommel. I have the antelope shoes size 38. Rommel will go back to Germany see his wife. Isn't it beautiful? And for Perry it's just the same... as Rommel is leaving. You know that little Leon got his first tooth? He is so funny... So don't kill Rommel, right? Funny, I talk about Rommel... and here he comes. Wonderful! The Feldmarschall has just arrived. Quick! Feldmarschall Rommel is coming! The troops are waiting for you. Thank you. Open the door! Yes, sir! - So? - Open. Quick! - Where is Leon? - Inside. He wanted to talk to you. Help me. What a family! Now I'm dead in the water! Antelope shoes. For Feldmarschall Rommel. Look. What's that? My friend Duchemin. He must have found the shoes. In antelope? Go. Let me see? Very nice. Thank you Mr Duchemin. Would you like a glass of champagne? Please come. Come with us. The soldiers may leave. Fall out! Duck! Everybody duck! Come. Quick! The Kraut! Put that in. Now we must get out. He is not dead, right? Not yet. The shoes. My car. The car! The Feldmarschall car! Don't shoot! Out Friedrich. You're on the way! Wait, I'll help. Forward! HEIA SAFARI! What happened? Terrorists! There! No no! Not my fault! I pull the chain... and BOOM! Hold on! Still here? Me? Careful, there's a shed! Head down! What? I know! Head down again! They are outside. Jeff will go to the boat. Hurry, we must help.. Why did you do that? I had the shoes. You ruined everything. Here they are! We are dead. Look! They sent airplanes. They're Friends! English! Careful! Friends all right! Look behind! Where are we going? Straight ahead! Careful there's water! Breathe in! Careful! Where are you? All right, papa in love? Papa is fed up with you! You don't even know... where you are going. Look at me, I'm all wet! I'm good for a headache again. Hide the car! What are you doing in there? He dropped me in the water. I can't even swim. Come here. Quick! I'm fed up with you all. Not a good time to be fed up. We must get out of here! Inside! Damn you're slow! Rush to the Pointe-aux-Moines. Soon enough they'll understand... and be on our backs again. Go! Needless to say I'm not happy! You're a complete and utter prat! What? Look! Maybe I'm a prat but... Rommel is going back to Germany with my shoes. Couldn't you say that before! Nobody listens when I speak! The mission is over. Careful, damn it! Go left! After Rommel? Quick! Look who's coming! HEIA SAFARI! What should I do? Come closer and stop. Give me your helmet and oilskin. Quick! Gestapo. We're covering Feldmarschall Rommel. What's happening? English commandoes in SS uniforms... are following us and shoot without warning. Attention! Alarm! What did you say to them? To shoot on sight. - At who? - Just look. Before they finish talking, you'll be on the boat. A boat? To go where? To England! I refuse! You gave him a good one! Do you think he will be angry? You bet! Before England you'll make peace. You, push. All right papa in love? All right son. Now we won't meet anyone until England... Look!
