RODYA: "Great men smash laws," "smash old ways in order to create new ones. "Great men are not afraid to be criminals." There's a lot I can forgive in a sick man, but not anything. Please meet my cousin, Porfiry Petrovich, scourge of Petersburg's criminal classes. Examining magistrate, actually. It's a policeman with knobs on. (ALL LAUGHING) - Brother. - Oh, my darling! Oh, my darling boy! What are you looking for? A really good time. She seems to have made an impression on you, Rodya. She's a prostitute. Desperate to get my hands on a witness, you see. As for a murderer, even better. PORFIRY: Oh, we'll make him suffer. But will he make himself? (DOOR OPENING) MAN: You are a murderer. (WOMAN SCREAMS) Come out, then. I'm ready for you. (FLY BUZZING) (LAUGHING) You again. I didn't make a mistake the first time. I'll do it again. Because you're just a means to an end. You're not even a person. You're just a piece of shit that I had to wipe off my shoe so I could... So I could keep going. This isn't why I'm doing it. This is not... Would Napoleon be stuffing his pockets like this? (GASPS) Who are you? - Did Porfiry send you? - Porfiry? Not a name I know. And as much as I admire Napoleon, I'm no emissary of his either. - You heard me? - Heard you? I virtually saw you. Allow me to introduce myself. Arkadije Svidrigailov. My sister's tormentor. - I don't think so. - I'd love to see her again. - And I was hoping that... - You know she's in Petersburg. I was on the same train. Well then, if you want my help, I'll, er... I'll give you directions back to the station. I wanted to make your acquaintance, too, of course. - Have done for some time actually. - Well, you've made it. So will you go? What did I do that was so terrible? Her honour has been outraged. Yes? But just imagine for a moment that I'm the one who was helpless. Helpless with love. I'm only human. So, in fact, it was perfectly natural for me to suggest that we elope together to Switzerland or America. My sister was thrown out of your house. Yes! I'm afraid my wife jumped to the wrong conclusions, but it turned out all right in the end. I came clean. - You're still a creep. - But not a murderer. - What? - I'm sure you've heard about my wife's misfortune. - Dirty work by the sound of it. - She died from natural causes. The enquiry established it. Besides, I... I only used that little horsewhip twice. Which I think, to be perfectly frank, she rather liked. - Liked? - All women like being wronged. They relish occasions like that. Diversions and smack, she got one. Do you know that my wife came to see me an hour after her funeral? What? Then again the other day on the train. And today in my apartment. - A ghost? - Oh, yes, but nothing dramatic. She reminds me to do something and then off she goes again. - But it feels so real when she comes. - How do you know? Because they always are. - What did you say? - Nonsense. - Just go and see a doctor. - I know I'm ill. That's why she visits me. Who visits you? Look, what do you want with my sister? I want her permission to offer her 10,000 rubles to lessen the inconvenience of her break-up with that puffed up, provincial parvenu. - Don't you ever give up? - There's no calculation in my offer. If there were, the sum would be more. And in any case, you should also tell her that my wife has left her 3,000 rubles. I don't want her to be enthralled to me. I just don't want her to be enthralled to Luzhin. You're still trying to position yourself with her. I've released the feelings I had for her. I just want to see her. Once, before I... Before I go away. No. I'm not wearing any of this. And she won't be able to bear it. If she marries him, she'll simply be accepting money anyway. My wife kept me like I was a piece of treasure she'd stuffed in her pocket. Your sister doesn't deserve that fate. - Talk to her. - Why should I intervene for you? Because I think we see things the same way. Don't you? I think we're birds of a feather. You're a bloody vulture. Those ghosts you see... - They don't trouble me. - Oh, I think they do. Interesting thing is, though, I know how my ghost got there. What about you? I trust your journey was satisfactory. Our journey, yes. Our arrival less so. - I sent my apologies. - I brought them here. Got himself sent Mr Razumikhin to us. I have to inform you that it appears to be the case that Arkadije Svidrigailov is in Petersburg. Can't he leave Dunya in peace even here? He is here, no doubt, busily reverting to his old customs. But you need have no fear that he will be able to make Dunya the subject of them. He came to see me. He's desperate for a meeting with you, Dunya. - He has a proposition. - My God. It's all right. I know what this one is, Mother. Anyway, there's more. His wife has left you 3,000 rubles in her will. Is this true? I have heard it, too. Then thank God and pray for her, Dunya. - What else did he say? - And this, this proposition? Later, Mother. I have some business to attend to so I shan't intrude any more. But you meant to come for the whole evening. Yes, I meant to. Under certain conditions. Which haven't been met. Please don't talk so legally. You two can clear this up now because if Rodya really did insult you, he'll apologise for it, won't you? Some limits once crossed, well, there's no going back on it. There is for my sake. Dunya, I think very highly of you. Adore you, as it were. But I cannot assume an obligation which is so incompatible with my... Your what? I've always considered you an intelligent and noble-minded man. I'm marrying you, for heaven's sake. Don't disappoint me. Don't force me to make a choice. A choice? You mean to put me on a par with him? Of course. He's been precious to me all my life. You are looking to your future, Dunya. I have to be more precious. But you wrote me about Rodya and you said things that aren't true. I do not recall having written anything untrue, madam. I did not give the money to Sonia as you claimed. I gave it to her family. So you lied, didn't you? She... She is a member of that family. - Unworthy, immoral... - Unhappy. But still worth 10 of you. So you'd be happy to introduce her to your mother and sister, would you? Oh, I already have. Yes. We sat together yesterday, didn't we, Mother? Rodya. I think my judgement has been proved to be sound in this matter. I shall now expect to be spared any further meetings of this sort. And perhaps I should be spared any further meetings, too. This is indeed a new turn, Dunya. I can't help wondering if it isn't connected with the 3,000 rubles - bequeathed to you. - Shame. You really were calculating on our helplessness, weren't you? - I make no such calculations. - Well, not now anyway. I'll leave you to consider Svidrigailov's proposal. I'm sure it'll be of agreeable significance to you. This is the man you intend to marry, sister. - Get out. Just get out. - Shall I break his head first? If I leave, and you may be certain of this, I shall never come back. Think about it carefully. It needs no consideration at all. At all. Out. PULCHERIA: God has spared us. DUNYA: I'm sorry. Forgive me. Well, I think it's a wonderful development. (DUNYA LAUGHS) (CLEARS THROAT) Shall we eat? - See you. - SVIDRIGAILOV: Hello, neighbour. How much do you charge? - Why? - Why? It's a perfectly reasonable question to ask a prostitute, isn't it? How much? You want a go of me? No, thank you, my dear. I like two things. Whole-hearted vice or seducing virtuous women. And with you, well, it wouldn't be either, would it? Goodbye. "Borrow 1,000 from me," my uncle keeps saying. So that's what I'm going to do. Start-up capital. And that's where we could join forces. But we've only just had news of this money. He knows the publishing trade better than anyone in Petersburg. And I know exactly what needs translating. I'm very drawn to the idea. And it's certainly true we'll have to stay here for the foreseeable future. Now we're getting somewhere. - Rodya. - Where are you going? You're in on this, too. - No. - DUNYA: What do you mean? I think it's best if we don't see each other for a while. I'm out of sorts, really. I'll be in touch. I'll keep you in my thoughts. And I love you. - God have mercy, Rodya. - I've made up my mind. It's like Porfiry said. I know the value of my family. That's why you have to try and forget about me. It may not be forever 'cause I might even come back. If you love me, say goodbye to me now. Make it up with us, please. Let's go back to how we were before. Don't make me hate you. - What are you doing to our mother? - It might not be forever. Dunya, this isn't cruelty, this is madness. He's insane. Wait, wait, I'll be back. Rodya, you can't do this. - Go back to the room. Stay with them. - What, and let you go? No. I'm not like them. Give up on me, Razumikhin. You might have done already, despite what you say. But not them. Don't abandon them. Do you understand? Do you see? No. I don't see. I can't see a thing. Just watch over them, then. I'm sorry it's so late. I might never see you again. Come on. Sit down. You're so skinny. Nothing of you. You're like a ghost. What's wrong? - Do you despise me? - No. No, no. Of course not. I just want to know what's going to become of you, that's all. What do you mean? Well, it won't be long before Katerina Ivanovna dies of consumption. - Don't say that. - It's true. Anyway, listen. What the point I'm trying to make is you're going to have to look after the children. Then who's going to go and earn? It'll have to be little Polya. You've mortified and betrayed yourself for nothing. You live in all this shit and filth. And you hate it. But you also know that you're not doing anyone any good or saving anyone by it. And tell me, tell me, all those holy emotions you have, how do they sit with the low way you actually live? Hmm? I mean, wouldn't it make more sense if you just threw yourself into the Neva? Yes. - Yes? - But I can't, can I? I've got Katerina and the children to think of. Why haven't you gone mad? I pray. - Where did this come from? - Lizaveta. Where's the bit about Lazarus? Hmm? I can't find it. - What do you want it for? - I want you to read it to me. Why? You don't believe in God. I want to see how much you do. - I won't. - Come on. You've ruined yourself. You're sitting on the edge of a stinking pit. And you reek of it. But you're waiting for a miracle, aren't you? Well, come on, let me see if your heart's in it. SONIA: "Jesus said, 'Take away this stone.' "Martha, the sister of him that was dead, said unto him, "'Lord, he has been dead four days.' "And then he cried out with a loud voice, "'Lazarus, come forth.' "And he that was dead came forth. "Bound hand and foot with grave cloth. "And Jesus said unto them, "'Loose him and let him go.' "And many of the Jews which came to Mary "and had seen the things which Jesus did "believed in him." Do your beliefs make you less lonely? My beliefs make me want to go to you. Come on, then I know who killed Lizaveta, Sonia. It's frightening. What will you do? Come back here and tell you. Just you. Come back from where? The campaign. War is raging. I've come to see Porfiry. Well, I see, er... I'll tell him you're here. Wait there. - You don't have an appointment? - No. Go in. Sir. Come in, come in. So here you are then, in our neck of the woods. Sit, here. That's it. I've brought you my statement about the articles. Oh, fine, yes. Oh, well, this is fine. I don't need any more than that. (CREAKING) You said you wanted to ask me more about my dealings with the pawnbroker. Ah. - So? - Oh. No hurry. Did I tell you my living quarters are just through there? They're being decorated. I'm only in that apartment for the time being. Move back here when it's all spick and span. Quite a perk, government accommodation. - I suppose so. - I even get to choose my own wallpaper. Oh, yes. Quite a perk. The only thing is it's living above the shop. - Well, so to speak. - I've heard there are certain techniques you investigators go in for. Ages spent on chit-chat. Until the person being interviewed almost forgets what he's doing there. Then, as the suspect sits back in his chair, spreads his legs, the investigator asks him, "Why did you kill her?" Or him. All of a sudden, the suspect is on the floor. Metaphorically. Not just metaphorically. Oh, I'm sure. So is that why you think I've been banging onto you about my choice of wallpaper? Look! Question me or let me go. In fact, I won't even ask your permission to get out of here, I'll just do it now. Calm down. What are you talking about? Why should I be questioning you anyway? I'm sorry about laughing like that. It's actually some kind of affliction. Social awkwardness or nerves or some such. My not being married is another symptom of it. Men like us, we're not very good at breaking the ice, are we? I say, do sit down. You'll just set my nerves off again then I'll be helpless. (SIGHS) Sorry about this. Piles. Not helped by the fact I'm sitting down all day. Actually, I'm thinking of taking up gymnastics. You know, the skipping rope. And all that. In the meantime, you'll just have to forgive me for all this walking up and down. Sorry. Am I doing it again? (LAUGHS) You're waiting for the hammer blow now, are you? I suppose the work of an investigator is almost military. Does one go for an all-out attack and take the enemy in one go? Or just dig trenches and lay siege to them day by day, wearing them out bit by bit? Some gentleman I might have my eye on, I just leave him alone. I make sure he knows I know everything. The whole sordid story. I make sure he knows I'm watching him all the time. Oh, a real reign of terror. And what if his nerve is as strong as yours? It's my job to get on his nerves. - Do you always succeed? - Yes. Because I always have the advantage. - Which is? - I haven't done anything. He can always lie about what he's done. Or he can give me a clue. And they usually do. - How? - I didn't ask. I'll tell you all the same. His mouth starts to run away with him. He starts saying things he shouldn't about events he's not supposed to have been involved in. He can't help but draw attention to himself, despite himself. It's in his nature. The nature of a murderer. Oh, I do hope you're not going to faint again. - You're looking terribly queasy. - I'm fine. - I'll open a window for you, shall I? - I'm fine. When you fainted before, we didn't know who you were. We all know who you are now! Stop laughing at me. If you suspect me, then arrest me. If I killed Lizaveta and the pawnbroker, then prosecute me. If you feel you have the right to do it, then just do it. - Because I'm sick of this. - Dear me. Rodya Romanovich, this won't do. Now this won't do at all. Let me get you some water. I'm sick of it. You'll drive yourself crazy if you go on like that. Back to square one with your illness. Here. Drink this. I'm fine. Heavens. Hanging a murder on yourself. You're going off into a spin. All over the place. - What do you mean? - Going back to her apartment and asking about the blood. (LAUGHS) What an exploit. - How do you know about that? - Doesn't matter. What it proves is you're suffering from delirium. I wasn't delirious when I did that. Why say that? It would mitigate what you did. I don't want to mitigate it. Guilty men always want mitigation. That proves you're not one of them. Don't you think? - You're lying. - I wish you well. No, sincerely. Otherwise I really would be asking you the kind of questions that make you fall off your chair. I'd have taken a statement from you. I'd have had your room searched. But I haven't behaved like that, have I? Which must mean I don't suspect you. - Well, don't you think? - You're lying. Obviously you can't see what I'm saying at the moment because you're not yourself. - You're lying. - You see? Am I a suspect or not? Why are you forcing yourself on me like this? Oh, I can't stand this. Don't you want to see my little surprise? He's hiding in here. I even locked him in so he couldn't run away. You think you can make me crazy. Make me burst with it. Burst? Even a man like you needs a pin. (CRASHING) PORFIRY: What's going on? Why have you brought him up? Take him away, now! OFFICER: But he wants to tell you about... I killed the pawnbroker and Lizaveta. It was me. It was me. I'm the one that did it. - I will make a statement. - Oh, for God's sake. I'm sorry about this. In the circumstances, I shall have to say goodbye to you. So you're not going to be showing me your little surprise, then? We'll see each other again soon. An unexpected development. It seems I'm not needed now. What do you want with me? I beg your pardon, sir. I was the surprise Porfiry was supposed to show you. - Who are you? - I live in the pawnbroker's building. I was there when you were thrown out. When you asked to be taken down to the police station. You were so brazen, I went and reported you. - And our encounter in the yard? - Porfiry suggested it. I thought I was doing the right thing. But then I heard how he tormented you in his office and I'm sorry if I was the cause of it. - You're not the cause of anything. - At least I hope you'll forgive me. You? It's me I should be hard on. Didn't you hear how faint-hearted I was? I need you to forgive me. It was you. It was me. Lizaveta. I didn't mean to kill Lizaveta. It was an accident. - I only meant to kill the pawnbroker. - It's not an accident. It wasn't my intention is what I meant. What have you done to yourself? I killed myself. Does this mean you won't leave me, Sonia? Tell me you had a reason. Tell me something I can understand. I did it so I could rob her, that's all you need to be bothered with. You must have been hungry, desperate. You were, weren't you? If I'd killed the pawnbroker because I was hungry, I'd be happy. You wanted to finish your studies. To repay your family's hopes for you. - Not really. - You did it to help your mother. - No. - You killed her for money and then you gave us your last penny. Did you give us her money? I buried her money. I actually never took a thing. I may never. I can't make anything of this. I killed a louse, Sonia, an insect. I dared to raise my foot and I dared to bring it down on her and I squashed her. I lay in my room in the dark and I worked up the courage to do it. - It was... - Shut up! Quite an achievement. That's how the devil talks. That's not you. I wish I was insane. Then I wouldn't feel like I do now, like... The louse that I killed. Not like Napoleon at all. Lonely, really. That's why I came to see you. I think I'm dead. I need you to tell me that that's not true. Confess. To God? Yes. Yes. You have to go. Go now to the Haymarket and bow down, kissing the ground that you've desecrated. Bowing down in front of the whole world and tell everybody in it what you've done. Yell it out and God will give you your life back. That's a confession, Sonia. And after that, there's just prison. You have to accept it. Give up to it. I won't give myself up to the police. They're no better than me anyway. And they'll just laugh at me for not spending all the money. No, no. Why should I? Because you'll never get it out of your mind. You'll never stop suffering. And you'll never be redeemed for it. I want you to save yourself. I have another one. - It belonged to Lizaveta. - Not yet, Sonia. All right. Then I shall listen to your prayers and you mine. Until there's time for us to go together to the police station. Wherever they send you. Siberia. I'll follow you there. You must never come. You can't. I am waiting for a miracle. Maybe I have to go find one. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) MAN: Sonia, Sonia! Sonia! It's Katerina. You have to come. (BABY CRYING) Please let mummy be well. Please let mummy be well... (KATERINA MOANING) Can I do anything at all, Sonia? I'm her neighbour. There are going to be expenses here. I'd like to put the children into a decent orphanage, so Sonia doesn't have that on her shoulders and I'll make sure she's pulled free of the Haymarket, too. So you can tell your sister I've made good use of her 10,000. - What's brought all this on? - Humanity. I mean, Sonia's hardly a louse, is she? Doesn't bear the slightest resemblance to some poor old pawnbroker you dared to raise your boot over. Like I say, Sonia's a neighbour. And the walls are thin. I told you we were birds of a feather, old man. Perhaps now we shall see more of each other. SONIA: Rodya! Hello, cousin. Shall we, er? The whole thing about Nikolai and his brother fighting on the kerb. Well, they were just trying to cause a diversion. A red herring that they'd... What's the term? Laid. - So I can tell him it's been cleared up? - Please do. You know, I climbed up the walls in my zeal to defend Nikolai. But now... - Thank God he's guilty. That's great! - Goodbye, cousin. Thank you. Dunya, who is it? Is it Rodya? Has he come? Just a messenger. He's been directed to the wrong rooms. (PRIEST CHANTING IN RUSSIAN) - Where have you been? - It doesn't matter. I didn't like it there anyway. Have you been to see Porfiry? Have you? Have you told him? Who's Porfiry? - I don't believe you. - No, really. Who is he? I don't believe you. You've got to pull yourself together. Now, if you'll excuse me. If you have any plans concerning my sister, I will kill you before you can put me in jail. And you know I can. Only one person can kill me. And it's not you. You've made your mother ill. You know that, don't you? Dunya's doing her best not to break down. They deserve better, Rodya. Well, they can get it from you. I give you permission to love my sister. I know she loves you. I hand my mother and my sister over to you. You don't need to talk like that any more. You're not involved in anything. Nikolai's the murderer. Porfiry's pressing charges. - He told you this? - He spelt it out. - How? - It doesn't matter. The main thing is it's not you. And you believe him? Who better than Porfiry to make me believe it? I'll tell Dunya you're in the clear, too. I do love her. Listen to me. All along I thought you were trying to betray me. I hadn't realised how much I'd betrayed you. How much I still do. You don't have to talk like that any more. You haven't done anything. We do understand each other, brother. An unexpected visitor for you, Rodion Romanovich. I was just passing and thought I'd drop in. Well, why don't you tell me what it is you've got to say? I can't give these up. I had a consultation with Zosimov. He tells me I've got diluted lungs. I tell him, "Well, at least I don't drink." He replies, "Maybe you should take that up instead." (LAUGHING) It's not a very scientific approach, is it? Oh, yes. The chit-chat business again. Look, I owe you an explanation. The last time we met, all our meetings actually, the way I've conducted myself has been, well... I'm sorry. I've gone in for all sorts of ploys and tricks, but what I regret most is... Well, I think we're both gentlemen and I haven't behaved like one. - All the psychology stuff, you mean? - Exactly. Nothing tangible at all. Just your character. This apology. Does this... Would you mind if I just put this in context first? Of how all this came to be. It's the least I can do. Your fainting fit in the bureau, that set me looking in your direction. Then I realised you were the author of that article. Ah, I thought at the time someone like that's bound to get into trouble and it was you. Zamyotov searched your room when you were ill, but we didn't find anything. And I thought, "Oh, well." But then you showed your face again, goading and teasing Zamyotov, but a hundred suspicions don't make a case. Not even when you went back to her apartment to ask about the blood. There was nothing I could actually touch. A case of professional frustration which meant, I'm afraid, that I started to take some liberties with you. And my pride. So... Even when Nikolai came to me, it made me not want to believe it. But you do now? Razumikhin tells me you're pressing charges against him. Razumikhin? Oh, I'm afraid he's just an innocent bystander in all this. - What do you mean? - I just used him to pass on information to you. - What? - Nikolai won't be able to keep it up. He's got some strange religious convictions about accepting suffering. But sooner or later, fear will get the better of him and he'll deny everything. - You'll... You'll still go ahead? - Oh, I doubt it. Nikolai's not our man. Who is? You are. You're our murderer. You're just playing games with me again, aren't you? If I'm guilty, then why don't you just put me in prison? Oh, I'm going to, sir. That's not the point. The point is what you should do. File a plea of guilty. Why should I? Because it would reduce the term of your sentence. You're not a hopeless villain. You've got a lot ahead of you. And you can look forward to it. So please come in. Come in and see the difference it will make to you. I swear to God. I don't want a reduction. We're just whispering in private here. That's all we're doing. You know, I'm still not sure what kind of man you really are. Let's see how it goes, shall we? - What if I run away? - No, you won't run away. After all, you don't believe in your theory. Now. So what would you run away with? Besides, running away is a solitary business. And the truth is you can't get along without us. - I kept coming back. - Of course you did. You wanted to come home. You still do. I'm homesick. That's not a confession. In your own time, then. But one favour I must ask of you. This is somewhat delicate. But if you plan on making some other kind of, well, exit, please leave a note. A short but detailed one if you wouldn't mind. And not forgetting to mention the whereabouts of the jewellery. It would be very decent of you. Good luck, sir. Through that door there is the apartment of my landlady, Mrs Resslich. Shall I introduce you two? See the door that's locked there? On the other side of it are Sonia's rooms. To be precise, right behind it. It's where they sat talking. Two days in a row. I've heard all this before. It's just rumour, it's just talk. I heard this particular talk coming from his own lips. - I don't believe you. - Then why are you here? Go on. Speak. It was the enactment of some theory he was expounding that he could create his own law. That to transgress against somebody like her was simply an act of daring. He evoked Napoleon. When he brought the axe over her head, he was a like-minded fellow. After it sunk into her skull, he was none too sure. Especially when he had to kill Lizaveta, too. You know about this theory? Well? - Razumikhin showed me. - Showed you what? An article my brother had written in a journal. Why is this door locked? Look, sit down. We'll discuss how to help your brother. - When did you lock this? - I have money and friends. I'll send him abroad. Get him the passport he needs. We could all go to America. You and I, your mother. I love you. Don't make me go off on my own. Open up! Open up! I'll do anything, Dunya. Don't look at me like that. Don't you realise you're killing me? Oh, my God. Somebody! Somebody! There's no one in. The landlady's gone out. You're just wasting your energy. Give me the key. Why would a girl go on her own to visit a single man in his lodgings? What would your explanation be? You'd have to betray your brother. So whatever happens, I have nothing to fear and I'm stronger than you, too. - You monster. - As you wish. Anyway, I was only speaking hypothetically. Look, I'll go and wait over there for you to reconsider. The fate of your brother and your mother is in your hands. Oh, I see. Didn't that used to belong to me? No. It was my wife's. - You killed her, but I'll kill you. - I thrilled you once, didn't I? - Never. - Yes. You almost yielded, remember? Out there in the garden that evening when the nightingale was still singing. - Liar. - Am I? Well, shoot me, then. If it's not true, fire away. You're burning like a bullet anyway. It's beautiful. All the heat you're bringing to bear on me. Shoot me. You don't hate me. You did that because you're scared of your own feelings for me. You think you can kill them by killing me. But you missed because your hands are shaking with desire. Call it anger if it suits your honour. I don't mind. Do it again. Make love to me again. - Keep away from me. - I'm waiting for you, Dunya. You see? You've forgiven yourself for your sin. You've pardoned yourself for your crime. Now we can really begin. Please just get it over with and let me leave. So you don't love me? Could you? Ever? Never. Take it. Go now. Go on. (DOOR CLOSES) Polya, take the children inside. Sonia, I'm going away to America. I've entrusted the money for the children under signature. And some five percent bonds for you worth 3,000 rubles. - No, sir. - You won't need to live the way you do. If you follow Raskolnikov to prison, you'll need it. Unless he kills himself. Yes, I heard it all, but I'm not going to tell anyone. Goodbye, Sonia. I'm not going to make... I promise. None of that old mother's way of mine. I'm learning how people are here. You. I've spoilt myself again, haven't I? I've been reading your article, Rodya. I have it here. Razumikhin gave it to me. I suddenly realised you have all these ideas in your head. And I've been bothering you and distracting you. But that's what you've been doing. That's what you've been up to. Thinking, thinking and... I don't understand what you wrote, but I understand that now. What I wrote was rubbish, Mother. They were saying you were mad. They almost had Dunya believing it, too. But they just don't recognise intellect when they see it. That's their trouble. - Where's Dunya now? - She's... She's out. You're here. You came to visit your mother. You came to console her because you've... I'll make us some coffee. Stop it, stop it, stop it. That's not why I came. Listen to me. I never meant to be cruel to you. But I'm going to make you very unhappy. And I'm so sorry. Because I love you. I've always loved you. Will you remember that? And will you always love me as you do now? Please. Like that. Like that. It's just like when you were little. It's just the same. Are you going away somewhere? - Goodbye. - Now? Right now? Pray for me. It's... It's a job? Wait, wait. It's a new career. I always knew that you would do such great things. Leading light, my darling. A leading light. - That's enough. That's enough. - You have enemies, don't you? And they want to do you down. And you have to go away until... Until they... Until it... Until you come back in triumph. I understand. I do. I understand. Goodbye, Mother. Does she know, too? I think she's choosing not to. - Who told you? - Svidrigailov. - Time to go. - To turn yourself in? Yes. But I don't know why. Because by taking your suffering, you'll be taking away half your crime. Crime? Some crime. I killed a filthy old money-lender, Dunya. A louse. I'm only going to confess because I'm a coward. A mediocrity. And according to Porfiry, it may do me some good. Well, maybe good is something you need to be reacquainted with. I haven't killed any children. I haven't raped any young women. I'm not part of an advancing army that separates mothers from their children, wives from their husbands. I went to war for a different reason, Dunya. I went to war for an idea. And I couldn't even manage it properly. I failed. Miserably. You're failing even now. You're taking yourself somewhere so far away, so foreign you should beg to return. There's no need to argue. Is there? It'll be years before I see you again. I'm perfectly capable of punishing myself just as much. There are private transgressions, Rodya. This isn't one of them. Walk away, Dunya. Don't watch me go. Go on. Go on. Let me see you. (SINGING IN RUSSIAN) For you. Ah. Mr Raskolnikov. - Have you come for me? - Sorry? One of your neighbours, miss. Mr Svidrigailov. He's dead. Shot himself. He left this letter saying that he knew what he was doing, but I need to know more, obviously. Were you acquainted with him at all? I don't have to go now. Don't you see? I can call the whole thing off. Make amends. No! No! Why should I confess now, Sonia? I don't even need your bloody cross. Like a dog. Just like you treat a dog. You must love the expression on her face when you use her like that. You even got her on her knees again just now. Did you choose her because you can torture her? Do you go to her because she lets you be a coward? You raise your foot over her and stamp on her like she was a louse, like she was the pawnbroker. You thought you were Napoleon. You're nothing. You thought you had courage. All you really have is cruelty. All those dreams you had about yourself. How dare you? How dare you? You're no better than the shit beneath your feet. You should learn something and kiss it. Learn something. I'm a murderer. (SCREAMING) I am a murderer! (FLIES BUZZING) RODYA: You look pale. I've been ill. That's why I haven't been able to come these past few weeks. I thought you'd finally seen sense and given up on the idea. You won't be able to keep this up for seven years. Will you? You're still making yourself useful? The town doesn't have many who do seamstress work. And practically no milliners so... You're becoming a necessity. To those in need of hats? Not only those.
