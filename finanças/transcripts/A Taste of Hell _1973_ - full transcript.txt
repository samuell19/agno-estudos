[mysterious music] [thud] Don't you ever miss? [music fades out] That's 250,000 pesos you owe me. I'll tell you what I'll do, I'll settle for a buco. Run up and get me one, will ya? Peping, pack up the thermite and get the men ready to move out. [tense music] Kill him. [gasps] Lieutenant Mann! [Mann] Take cover. Lieutenant Mann! This is the end of many lone hard chases. You are completely surrounded and have no hope. Surrender peacefully. There is no need for further bloodshed. I want you alive, Lieutenant. No chance, Kuramoto. How many of your men is your life worth, Lieutenant? One more, Lieutenant. [gunshot] Hold it, Kuramoto. If I surrender, will you let my men go free? You know I cannot do that. But you have my word as a Japanese officer, they will receive the proper treatment. Like at Bataan? That was not my command. Have your men step forward in the open and discard their weapons. Lieutenant, please remove yourself from your men to assure me there will be no tricks. I have your word? [Kuramoto] You have. Spread out! [gunshot] [gasps] [gunfire continues] [explosions] -[dramatic music] -At long last. The elusive Lieutenant Mann is dead. [Mann making noise] [music fades out] Okay everybody, let's go. [dramatic music] [tense music] [nostalgic music] She is very loyal to her memory of Mister Barry. It is sad. It has been a long time. [music fades out] But now with the Japanese less than a mile from here, I think it's a good time to get out of here and make a sweep through this area. Here and here. We'll be gone a couple of weeks. Maybe with us gone, the Japanese will change their mind about their reinforcements. What do you say, Mario? Fine. But we must find some way of lowering their guard, for it will soon get to be too difficult to supply food for you and the men. Don't worry about us, father. We can always steal food from the enemy and the rice will have the sweetness all its own. Is it not time for you to go? Yeah, I think it is. [Mario] You must say goodbye to Maria first and Tomas must see his mother. Okay. [nostalgic music] [Mario] I hope you didn't mind the little trouble we brought you. [native language] Salamat. I can remember when children still played in the streets at this hour. Now, everyone is afraid to come out of their houses. [mother] Tomas! [gasps] It's good to see you, Tomas. I'm sorry, Maria. It's only me. It's only me. Since when have you been so modest, my big one? You looked like you were expecting someone else. Well, I was thinking a young woman's silly thoughts. Sit down and I'll warm you some coffee. Have you been here long? We've been here about an hour. We're meeting with your father and other men from the baryo. I still remember you like your coffee strong. Is Tomas with you? You think I could keep him away from here? No. He's a very loyal and good man. You know, we didn't expect you for another week. We ran into a Japanese patrol. Looks like they're going to reinforce the outpost. We're going to have to move our camp about a half a days march from here. We will all miss you. [native language] Salamat. I hope you won't be in too much danger here in the village. I guess it really depends on what the new commandant's like, huh. If he is like Captain Seiko, we will all be safe. I hope so. Ah, Filipino custom, no touch. It's a custom you seem to be able to turn your back on conventionally every now and then. At times. Will the reinforcements cause you much trouble? Naw, we'll just have to be more careful. I've got a couple of men posted about five kilometers up the river. Any trouble in the village, you get in touch with them. We'll be back as soon as we can. I think I've stayed a little too long. But you haven't finished your coffee yet. I don't really want it, thanks. Jack... this is one of those convenient times. [music fades out] I'd better go see my brother. [Maria] Were you going to leave without a goodbye? And give you a chance to say bad things about me in your prayer? Oh, you know I wouldn't do that! You're not too big to be spanked yet, you know. [tense music] [panting] [panting, drinking water] [music fades out] [screams] [panting] [hens clucking] [clanging] [man 1] Waiting for our enemy to come to us sometimes takes too long. [man 2] It will not always be so. Some day when General McArthur returns, we will go to them and rid the Philippines of them forever. [tense note] [Seiko] Maybe, but not today. [tense music] [music fades out] It is with great pleasure that I pour this toast for you, Captain Seiko. You've done your job well. Thank you very much. I must be honest and tell you that at first, I was not at all impressed with your tactics of war. Too soft. Much too lenient. [Seiko] I'm sorry that you felt that way, sir. [tense music] [speaking Japanese] I am going to help you, but I must ask you first. Where is the enemy camp? No? [speaking Japanese] [panting] [music fades out] [panting] [Kuramoto] It has always been my policy to be firm, rigid even, in the ancient traditions of the Samurai. If I may speak personally for a moment. Please. You see there on the wall... my proudest possession. It has been handed down from father to son for generations. [tense music] Who are you? Are you from the baryo? But my friend... [music fades out] We have always been Samurai, for as long as anyone can remember. And that blade has never been used. My family has lived and died in honor for over 500 years. An enviable record, sir. [tense music] [Kuramoto] Would you care for another? Thank you, sir. [speaking Japanese] [panting] [music fades out] [grunts] [Ditas] Pedro, where are you? -Pedro! -[dramatic music] Oh, Pedro you come out. Oh, oh! [soothing music] [panting] Mister, mister, please wait. I'm sorry, mister. Please! I'm not afraid anymore. Please, mister! I didn't understand. Mister, look, look at me. [sobbing] God made me ugly, too. [tense music] Yesterday, or rather last night, one or more foolish villagers broke into our garrison, killing three soldiers and freed the guerrilla prisoner. I'm sorry sir, but I don't think any of our people are capable of doing such a thing. It's possible that it was not one of the villagers. Probably they were guerrilla. Most likely, sir, but we are not so brave. We are only simple peasants. It is not the policy of my country to administer justice unfairly to the peoples is has conquered. We are most grateful, sir. Please, let us not be too hasty with your... gratitude. Since I must have control of all these bandits who call themselves guerrillas, I must unfortunately ask you and your people to supply me with a volunteer to replace the escaped prisoner. You cannot do this. We've done nothing, we know nothing of guerrillas! Mario, what would your son Tomas feel if he heard his father deny him? My son Tomas died fighting the invasion. Mario, enough of these lies! [music fades out] Let the volunteer step forward. [soldier] Stop! [woman] Mario! There, take that old man. [woman speaking native language] Take someone else if you must. Why do you want such an old man? If I pick a young strong man, probably he will live for a week, maybe two, and I need to know where the guerrillas are hiding, very soon. I have no intention of spending the remainder of my career here. Take him along. [sobbing] That damn Major Kuramoto is going to find out that we may be conquered, but that does not stop us from being a free people in our hearts. Give me your bole. What are you going to do? David, dig a hole there. Andre, we will need some wire and rope. [Andre] All right, Mario. Do you like the new addition to our baryo,Pacing? You will end up standing alone in this. Our flag pole is magnificent, but without the flag it was meant to hold, it remains as a man without the woman he loves. I'll make one right away. American? Filipino. [nostalgic music] [panting] -[screams] -[tense music] [Ditas screaming] Witch, witch! -Witch! Witch! -[music stops] Witch! Witch! Mario, I saw a witch in the stream. Calm down, calm down, Ditas. It's probably a Japanese trick. We will see about their witch. Come on. Come on, men. [Pedro] Wait, wait, it is not a witch! It is my new friend. Don't hurt him! [soothing music] Can I come in? This was my hiding place first. Ditas told everybody you are a witch. Mario and some men are looking for you. I thought you might come here. I found this place when I was trying to hide from the other children. They were making fun of me. What's your name? My name is Pedro. Can't you talk? Were you born like this? I was. How come you never look at me? I'm not afraid of you. I've seen a lot of things uglier than you before. You can use my cave if you want, I won't tell anyone. The next time I come I will bring something to eat. -[Peping] Pedro! -[music fades out] I've got to go. That's my father. Don't worry, I won't tell anyone about you. [Peping] Pedro! [birds chipping] [man] Tomas, Jack, Juan is here. [panting] [nostalgic music] Beautiful, isn't she? I've thought for a long time that you are in love with her. Even before your friend Barry was killed. I think Maria is aware of it, too. You do love her, don't you? Yeah, I sure do. Why don't you tell her? I understand, but unfortunately Barry's dead. Yeah.... I don't know, maybe if he's alive I'd do something I never did before. As long as she's still mourning him though, I'm just gonna have to live with it, aren't I? Hey, let's forget about it, huh. We've got ourselves a war to fight. I am sorry, my friend. Salamat. [native song] Come on. No one can deny that Filipinos truly know how to roast a pig. Next year when I am big enough, maybe then you will dance with me. Of course. [speaking Japanese] In the morning your son will choke your throats. Come, it is time for you to go to sleep. But you said I could stay up late on this day. I'm a grown man now. Not quite, little Pedro. I don't know why you're complaining. I'm about to go home too and I'm a lot older than you. Than father and I will walk you to your door. All right, Pedro. Let's go. Goodnight Peping. Goodnight, Pedro and thank you. Goodnight, Maria. Don't forget, next year we will dance together. I won't forget. Be sure you don't. -Goodnight, Maria. -Goodnight. [native music stops] [natives start singing] I believe you have work at your desk. That's a nice song, father. Does it make you think of my mother? Yes. I miss her very much. We will be together again in heaven, won't we, father? Yes. Go to sleep now, I am going back to the fiesta. Goodnight father. Goodnight, Pedro. [natives continue singing] [grunts] [panting] Barry! [gasps] [imitates Tarzan] [Maria laughs] [Peping] Hey! Barry? What are you doing up there? -Barry.... -[grunts] [panting] [dramatic music] [screams] Barry! [sobs] [screams] [panting] Maria, what happened? What happened? -[Peping screams] -[Mann panting] [native singing stops] [chatter] [gasps] Mario! [tense note] See if Maria's all right. [Kuramoto] Captain Seiko! How did this happen? He was an old man, sir, and not very strong. Dispose of him. [children crying] Deploy your men. Sergeant. [Sargent speaking Japanese] [pig grunting] Surely you won't leave me just because I'm about to hang a flag. It's only a little thing I do. If I were ten years younger, I'd be out there in the hills. Pacing, this is our home. [Pacing] Mario... When will this end, Mario? When any stranger who stands on our soil is an invited guest. [dramatic music] This is an illegal assembly. Punishable by death. This is an illegal assembly. Punishable by death. Punishable by death. [gunshot] Mario! [screams] Mario! Mario! [sobs, gasps] [Pacing sobs] Mario, Mario... [Kuramoto] Remove the flag. [sad music] [sobs] What have you done, you're insane, insane! [gasps, sobs] [music fades out] Burn it. [Maria sobs] I want everyone in the baryo assembled here. Now! Sergeant. [Kuramoto] Take her with them. [soldiers speaking Japanese] Come here, Captain... I need your advice. Yes, sir. The problem, Captain, is how to prevent any future illegal assembly such as this. Yes, sir. What would you advise, Captain? I am waiting, Captain. Hostages, sir. Hostages. Very good. And who should be the hostages? -Men? -No, sir. The children then, Captain? No, sir, not the children. What? Not the children? Are you becoming a weakling, Captain? [Seiko] I suggest the young women. -[dramatic tone] -The Filipino male holds his women in extremely high esteem. I commend you, Captain. And give you the honor of selecting the ten most beautiful. Proceed, Captain. [tense music] I have selected ten, sir. Yes, very good. You won't mind if I choose one, Captain? You are too beautiful to be left behind. [music stops] [speaks in Japanese] It would be a great waste to allow such lovely creatures, primitive as they are, to shrivel away in this [Indistinct]. Pick ten of your best men who have done exceptionally well, and we will reward them with female companionship. Lock her up and give me the key. [soldier] Ha! Lock her! Salamat. Tomas! We got this guy running around knocking off the Major's men. Sooner or later, the Japanese down in the village are gonna start taking hostages. We're still alive because we've been able to hit and run. And they never knew where we were. I figure we move out of here and show ourselves, we're gonna give up the one advantage we've had. I say we stay. But then, it's not my baryo. I don't have a family down there. So, if you people want to go, let's go. What are you standing there for? Get your gear. Okay, tell everybody to pack up. Okay everybody, pack up! Pedro, Jose, take the point. All right, let's go! [thrilling music] Are you telling me the truth, Pedro? Yes. Look, you know there's no such thing as a hiute, boy. There is. He was my friend, but he killed my father. And I must kill him! Pedro. Why don't you let me take you back to the baryo? No, I must kill him! Do you know where he is? On that mountain. Let's go find him, boy. Come on. You wait here, boy. Stay down. [panting] [panting] [nostalgic music] Murderer! You were supposed to be my friend. You killed my father. Murderer! -[dramatic music] -[sobbing] Murderer! You were supposed to be my friend! You killed my father and now Jack will kill you! [Pedro sobs] Get up. [tense note] Jesus Christ! [sad music] Barry, why didn't you let us help you? Did you kill the kid's father? Hey... Maria still loves you, Barry. I can't do that! Barry, come with... come with me and let me help you. Barry! [tense music] The whole baryois the same. What happened? The Japanese killed your father. I can do nothing, I have no gun. [man] Major Kuramoto has killed Mario. He took Maria and the other girls as hostages. [music fades out] They must be destroyed! We don't have enough men. You plan the battle. We'll have the added strength of the baryomen and their bolos. I don't think they wanna, fight. They'll fight, or they'll be [indistinct]. [crickets chirping] The guerrillas will know by now that we've taken the baryowomen as hostages. They retaliate. It will be at night. Have you alerted the guards? Yes, sir. The Japanese will expect us to attack at night, as we usually do. Tomorrow, we will wait till sunrise and hope to surprise them during their morning exercises. I'll signal the attack by shooting the three lookouts on the inside. And Jack's group will attack at the same time from the south. And you Max, you bring the group in from the west, after we've made contact. No! Captain Seiko. Captain Seiko! Yes, sir! Have you chosen you ten men? The girls are waiting. And the one in the hot box? I will deal with her later. -[tense music] -They are coming! [whispering] What do they want? How can you ask? [gasps, screams] No! [all screaming] No! [women sobbing, screaming] [women continue screaming] [women sobbing] [screaming ceases] [crickets chirping] [footsteps approaching] [rooster crowing] Bring her here. I shall quench my thirst this morning. Guard. -Bring the girl here. -Yes sir. [box door slams] [soldiers speaking in Japanese] They're taking Maria to the headquarters. -[tense tone] -[gasps] [grunts] [footsteps approaching] I believe you have other business to attend to, Captain. Outside. -[captain laughs] - [tense music] [Maria struggles] [gunshot] [choking] [gunshot] [man screams] -[machine fire continues] - [speaking in Japanese] Go! All right, move it out! [machine fire continues] [explosion] [machine fire] [speaking in Japanese] [gunshots, screams] [explosion] -Maria? -[inaudible] [yells] [explosion] [woman yells] [women yelling] [grunts] [gunshots, explosions continue] [gunshot, explosions continue] -[gunshot] -[Maria gasps] [battle noise finishes] [sad music] [Pedro whimpering] [music fades out]
