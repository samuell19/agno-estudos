Mom, you still here? Yeah. You need something? Can you listen for the door and just watch the kids for a sec? Just for a second. Hi! Come on in. Good morning. Sylvie will be right with you. Sylvie! Here, look, look, look, look. Look. We are going to have A magical, magical day, Princess Annabelle. Let's go see what we got over here, okay? Bye, honey. Say bye, Annabelle! Daddy loves you. Bye. Want to go in the fire truck? No, I want to go here. Oh, okay. That's a good spot for you. Hey, mom, do you happen to have anything I could take before you go to work? I'm not sure I do. 'Cause I've got these kids till 5:00 today, so... Let me see. Thanks. What are we cleaning? I'm cleaning the mess. There's a mess on the floor? Yeah. Oh, my goodness. My ... my Princess right here made a crumbled mess. Hey, oh, thanks, but i-i-i actually ... I need two to have any effect on me anymore. Don't you think your back would feel better if you walked around a bit, did your physical therapy? Yeah, I will, once the pain dies down. You have a boo-boo? Okay. Okay. Fine. Tickle, tickle, tickle! Oh, that helps! Thank you very much. Bye! I'm a tickle Princess monster. You're a tickle Princess monster? Coming, coming, coming. Mail boxes & thangs. Fay speaking. What are you doing? I'm watching "America’s next top model." I'm working. I haven't seen you in so long. Aren't you supposed to be watching those kids? They love this show. They pretend they're on photo shoots and pretend to be dieting. It's so ... Hi. Can I get a book of stamps with cars on 'em, if you got 'em? Uh, two Boston creams, and... Nipple Pierce. Ugh. Sure thing. ♪ The sun is beatin' down ♪ ♪ talks to his friends in the pumpkin fields ♪ ♪ has laugh lines and great ideas ♪ ♪ if only he could get out of here ♪ Can I help you find something? Uh, yeah, I-I think. Um, I'm looking ... s-something for my plants. I'm not sure this is even the right place to get it. Well, try me. Uh, powdered plankton? Right this way. Yeah, it's great ... especially sprinkled on a mushroom quinoa casserole, or even a grilled cheese, ma'am. People eat it? Well, fish and people, yep. I give it to my tropical plants. Oh, cool. I never thought of that. It makes total sense, though. I read that if you, um, give it to them, it replenishes their nutrients, you know, that they lack in the colder climates. Hold on one second. This is my secret to good health all year 'round. Seaweed? I eat this at least once a day. I haven't been sick with anything ... I mean anything ... Since I was 9 years old. You sound pretty ridiculously healthy. Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to come off like that. No, I ... I just ... I get really passionate about eating right and living right, and, um, have you been in here before? I shop at key foods. It's down the street. It's a little pricey in here. That's true, it is, unless you join the co-op. Then you get a discount. Oh, well, that's ... that's good to know. Or if you're friends with someone that works here. I'm sorry ... I didn't mean that you should be my friend. But not that we couldn't be. I ... I was just trying to explain how discounts work around here. I guess it's all about who you know if you want cheap plankton. I'm not really meant for retail. Oh. You can probably tell. Uh, no, I-I will take that bag of seaweed. Please. It was quite a sales pitch. Thanks. Sylvie? Mom? That you? Who else would it be? Wow. I know Wednesdays are your long days, so I went to the store and made you a feast. It looks amazing ... like a fancy restaurant or something. You didn't have to do all this. Who else is gonna treat you like you deserve? What happened to this place? To my room? Did you go in my room? Where did you get these? Jerry lent me some. Jerry? What do you mean, "lent"? Can't give it back ... it's all gone now. I mean I borrowed some of your money and bought it from him. You went through my things. Sylvie. You have got to stop lying and pull yourself together. I cannot do it all for you, sweetheart. You hate me. Of course I don't hate you. I love you. And that little accident set you back, is all, hmm? Yeah. Yeah. Stuff was different before the accident. That's right. I was dating around more. Mm-hmm. And you almost had your g.E.D., huh? Yeah, but my granddad never trusted me, and now you don't, either. Of course I do, and they did. I... I should never have gotten in the car that night. It wasn't your fault, mom. You must have just hit a patch of ice and hit that tree. I had to go see Jerry because you have all my medicine. I hate that you're in pain all of the time. I don't know why the doctors say that you're healed, when clearly you're not. It's... Sylvie. Hey. Hi, doctor. Hi. So, what seems to be the problem today? It's her sciatica. It's my... Which is it? Well, her whole back, really. Okay. So, uh... Your dislocated disk is still... ...giving you some trouble, huh? All right. I can't thank you enough, doctor. No problem. Uh, this is for physical therapy. She's in severe pain. When we discussed our pain-management policy here, you agreed to help your daughter comply. Well, I know that, and I did. I do. I'm her mother. I ... It's been several months. Physical therapy and an appointment with the pain-management clinic in Cornwall. A-And ... and what are they gonna do for her? Cortisone and steroid shots. God, what an asshole. Excuse me, Sylvie? I'm sorry, but my mom and I have done everything right. You're the one who's not doing your job right. You don't even care if I'm in pain. Oh, my god. I'm gonna grab my office manager. I'll be right back. What are you thinking? I'm sorry. I'm ... I'm panicky. I blurt things out when I panic. Shh. Hi, there, Ms. Worth. Ms. Worth. Hi. Hey. Uh, Dr. Kinski will continue to offer you emergency care for the next 30 days, but I’m afraid you're gonna have to find a new doctor. Y-You're dropping me? Well, by not following Dr. Kinski's recommendations, you now have a non-therapeutic relationship, so he feels it best you find another physician. My daughter needs the doctor's care. That is his job. What do you want us to do, just live in pain? I'm very sorry to hear about your difficulties. Fuck me! Hey, there. Long time, no see. Small world. Small main street. Do you mind if I hang this on your bulletin board? As long as you're not advertising anything illegal. No, it's just, uh, I’m looking for a room to rent. And I also need a p.O. Box, and, uh, I want to mail these containers of water. All right. Um... You ... you really do piercings here? Mm-hmm. Did you have to go to piercing class or something for that? Just had to demonstrate basic hygiene. Remind me not to come here for the "thangs," just the "mail box" part. Here is a key for your p.O. Box, if you just sign there. And, uh... Why are you mailing water? Well, I'm studying the river and local water sources. You know, I-I-I take samples and I send them to a lab at my old college. You determine the life of the river, and you determine the ... The health of the land, and all the life living in and around it. Th-th-that is just great. Thanks. Let me just line this with, uh...plastic and double up on the packing tape. Oh, I can do that. I'm gonna make a great big pile that you can't make. I can make a big... I've asked you not to kick my door. You're making scuff marks. I have a doorbell. See? Here's 10 bucks. Give me a Percocet. I got to charge you more than than 10 bucks, and I don't do singles. They're very high in demand right now. $10 is all I have. Just give me what I asked for. You need to charge more for your babysitting, Sylvie. I have an injury, and I need something for the pain ... now. Hey. Hi. Uh, I thought I'd get my produce here instead of key food. Right on. Did you find a place yet? In the last hour? Uh, no. Well, I-I remembered, after you left, uh, I've got a room to rent. Well, me and my daughter, that is. Um...and, you know, you two could have so much in common. Well, she loves to cook, and, well, you love food. And she loves to go outside. She loves the outdoors. So isn't that funny? We happen to have a spare room to rent, also. Uh... Okay. Great. We live in a house by, uh, the creek. Oh, I love it over there. I hike the trails by there all the time. Yeah? Well, isn't that something? What? Isn't what something? Hi. Hi. Come on in. Make yourself at home. Okay. Ahh. Aren't you ever gonna introduce me, mom? I mean, I'm standing right here. Oh, I'm so sorry. Hi. It's Sylvie. Becket Strom. Thank you. For what? I-I don't know. For just inviting me in, showing me the room to rent. Oh. Oh, yeah. Come. Come, come, come, come. Wow. You've got quite a green thumb. I know. It's a little freaky at first, but you get used to it after a while. No, I love it. Can I get you something to drink? Oh, just a glass of water, please ... with a slice of lemon, if you have it. Thank you. I'll put a slice of lemon in your coke, Sylvie, seeing as you like lemon so much, too. So...where are you from? I haven't seen you around. Uh, I'm from up near saugerties, via new paltz. Oh, world traveler. Compared to us, you are. Your family still in saugerties? Yeah. They're kind of hard to keep in touch with, though, because they don't believe in phones. No phones? Ugh. We keep in touch all the time. No, my parents and I keep in touch more spiritually than literally. I am trying to do my part to really focus on ... on doing something for the world around me. Is there anything else you wanted to know about me? Do you have any conditions, like allergies, or injuries we should know about? No. Well, I'm lactose intolerant. Sylvie is so sensitive about other people's concerns. Well, I'm the healthiest person I know, so... Mm. Do you have anything you want to ask us? Before you ask, um, fay and I are more like best-friend roommates than mother and daughter. Uh, she had me when she was young. You'd be the only man of the house. Good to know. The sound of the creek is so soothing. You know, I catch Sylvie looking out at those treetops all the time, just like that. This was my grandparents' house, and their parents were born here, too, and before that, it had to be just apes. Oh. No one in our family has left this town, ever. You know, this creek feeds right into the Hudson. Mm. Becket studies water. Oh, I remember doing that in school ... watching it turn from liquid to ice, or liquid to steam. I-I think he studies more what's in it, right, Becket? I don't think the state is doing its job protecting the Hudson, and I think the aquifers are being poisoned. See, the hydrological cycle continues, whether or not our water is potable after g.E. Dredges up pcbs or Halliburton Fracks. I want to get the e.P.A. Involved ... let them know that not enough is being done. I want to rally this community. You know, this is our river. My grandparents used to fish this river, swim in it, drink it. Now it's just ... it's a source of harm. We want to help. We want to help in any way we can. Really? We're with you, all the way. Can I see the ... the room that's for rent? Oh. Oh, of course. Right this way. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Yeah, nice walls. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Wow. Lots of dirt. I-If my plant supplies bother you, I can just move them. Not at all. You got fish oil and crab meal. Yeah, I'm gonna be snacking at night. Do you, uh, need to go pick up the rest of your things? N... t-this is pretty much it. Oh. One more thing. I run a daycare here during the week. Right now, I just have two kids, but they really sound like more, like five or six kids. Is that a problem? Uh, I forgot to mention it. I-I guess it's sort of important to know. Oh, no. I'm out and about when the sun rises. I don't like to miss a drop of daylight. Great. That's that, then. We're out. Oh, oh, my god. Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. Oh, oh, no. Oh. No, no, no, I need ... I need you to keep it together. Shh. I know we'll get some more, all right? It's okay. Yeah. And we'll figure it out, okay? Yeah. Hello, there. Hi, doctor. I don't know if you remember my daughter, Sylvie. Uh... She drove me in today, 'cause, uh, well, I can't drive with this pain. Sure. I-I haven't seen her since she was a lot younger. Mm. But I remember. What are you up to these days, huh? I'm ... I’m, um ... I'm in a lot of pain. Oh. Uh... Who am I seeing here, today? Me. Y-You're seeing me. I, uh, wrenched my shoulder out at work. Okay. Uh, post office, right? Well, mail boxes & thangs, actually. Mm-hmm. I, uh, was lifting a box I never should have, and, um, the pain is j... oh, oh. Ooh. Oh. It's killing me. You know, I can't sleep, i-i can't lift, I can't drive, I ... Oh, can't drive ... that's no good, huh? Mm, yeah. I'm going to write you a prescription to, uh, see the orthopedist. And another one to help you with the pain. In the meantime, obviously, no lifting, no skydiving, no rock climbing, either. Of course. Oh. Um... What's ... something the matter? Well, I was hoping for something a little more stronger than Tylenol 3. I'll prescribe an additional Vicodin regimen for you to use when the pain is at its worst. But if we're talking that much pain, I want you to go straight to the orthopedist. Oh, yes, I will. And I want to see you back here in three weeks, along with a report from the specialist. Oh. Yes. Uh... All right? O-O-Of course. Yes. Thank you so much, doctor. Okay. Thank you. You know, before the pills run out, maybe we could go up to Canada ... get some of the codeine syrup they sell over the counter. We could get a bunch of that until we figure something else out. It helps me ease the pain sometimes. You are not supposed to bring that stuff over the border. It's illegal here without a prescription. It wouldn't be you doing it. It would be me. You just have to come along 'cause I have a little record. Yeah, for driving drunk underage into Canada. You don't want me to be in pain and lose the kids. There are so many scams online. You got to go in person. You've already done enough illegal stuff, giving me your prescription pills. You'd totally go to jail if I told on you. You would never do that because you'd never see me again. We'd be separated. I'd be in jail. Of course not. We don't buy water. I only drink bottled water now, ever since Becket told us the regular water is ... is not good for you. Well, I don't think that's what he said, exactly. Well, I'm not taking any chances. I'm gonna say I ate earlier, do a little garden work, so you two can spend time together, hmm? What if he doesn't want to eat with me? Mnh, of course he will. Who wouldn't, hmm? You two are perfect together. Okay. Close your eyes. Okay. Where's fay? Picking up dog shit in the yard, raking, that kind of thing. She already ate. You have a dog? No, other people's dogs' shit. Oh, it smells so good. It's my secret specialty. Open your mouth. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Delicious. Oh. Forgot the drinks. I love this stuff. Thank you. What's in this dish? Well, I'll tell you some things, but not all. I don't give it all away on the first date. Uh, you don't have to tell me anything you don't want to. I'm just ... Jalapeños, cherry tomatoes, pork loin, heavy cream, smoked Gouda, two sticks of butter. What's wrong? Sorry. It was my stomach. I'm, um...Lactose intolerant. Yeah, I know. That means no milk, right? No dairy. No cheese, cream, butter. Oh. Bummer. What happened? I totally spaced the whole lactose-allergy thing. Oh, Jesus. How awful. Are you okay in there? Fine. Sorry. Don't want to be rude, uh... Just so much dairy at dinner, in the pork. I'm so embarrassed. Oh, we're roomies. No need to be embarrassed. Whose water? Our water. Whose water? Our water. We don't want your pcbs. We don't want your pcbs. We don't want your pcbs. It really means a lot to me you guys came out today. We wouldn't miss it. We'll come out every time. Sylvie used to do this all the time. Yeah? Mm-hmm. Right on. I try not to get too disappointed when the turnout's low. Well, you're doing something. That's what matters. Yeah ... we're nobody, but we have a voice. Whose water? Our water. Oh, Sylvie. Sylvie. Sylvie. Hold your signs up. Put your arms around each other. I'm not really doing this for show. Of course not. Thinking about water just makes me thirsty. Are you thirsty? Hmm? Hey, do you want to sign our, uh, petition against fracking and dredging? Why would I want to stop fucking and drugging? You know, maybe it would be better if you picked one thing the next time you protest. You're so right. Thanks, fay. Mom, I'm not feeling so good. She okay? Oh, yeah. She'll be fine. She, uh ... just that time of the month, you know? Sorry. Fay. Fay. Fay. Fay. Shh, shh, shh, shh. Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. What? It hurts, mom. No. You just had one. You need to pace yourself. Give it or I'll scream. If you scream, Becket will want to leave, hmm? I need to go to sleep. Fay, I ... I have to talk to you. I found this in the garbage. You found garbage in the garbage? No, compost. All of this is compostable. Fay, you, of all people, who turn houseplants into superspecies, have to compost. I usually just throw that stuff away. But i-it just takes a little time. You want to keep it moist, but not too moist. Uh, you stir it once a day. You want a good mix of carbonaceous and nitrogenous ingredients. There's nothing to it. I know you're just being helpful. Of course we should have a compost. I've always thought that. I just never thought our garbage was good enough ... I mean, the right kind of garbage. Actually, gum doesn't decompose. It really serves no good purpose on earth. Fresh breath? Well, there is that, I suppose. But, really, parsley and fennel are better for bad breath. Boo. So, fay is too shy to ask, but she wants to know if you could remove this really big rock from our yard so she could finally plant a garden outside. It's too heavy for us. I have a-a bad back, and she's not very athletic or coordinated. Of course. No, I'd love to. I ... yeah, I'll go take a look. Okay. Th-that rock's never been moved in the history of this house. It's not meant to be moved. I-I-It can't be. And I don't have a garden because I don't have time to take care of one. The ... the houseplants are fine. No weeding. We're gonna take care of that rock for you once and for all. Plus, Becket and I need some quality time together. Right now? That rock isn't going anywhere. It's not worth the trouble ... Really. Kind of like that rock. Hey, what if you two went to the movies instead, huh? My treat? I'm doing this. I want you to be happy, fay. Maybe I can get in here a little bit, break that up for you. Oh! Aah, fuck! Aah! Blazes, what happened? I think my hand is broken. I-I must have just lost my grip or my ... my aim, or something. I-I was just trying to help. We got to get him to the hospital right away. Are you in much pain? Yes. Oh. Go get an ice pack. I've got to get him to the doctor. Do you want me to come along? No! Come on, Becket. Up you get. That's it. Let me help. There you go. Okay. Okay. Mm-hmm. How's your hand? Hurts. Ugh, god, what a stupid mistake. I've never broken anything in my life. Well, let's get you to the doctor, hmm? Uh, this is embarrassing, but I-I don't have health insurance. I don't do doctors. My doctor's group takes walk-ins, and they take people without insurance on a sliding scale. Okay. Okay. Aah. Take it. Ooh. So sorry to be so much trouble. I'm so very sorry. It's all my fault. No. It's no one's fault. Humankind's been battling nature and losing since the dawn of time. The rock won. Oh. Oh. Um, ow. Everything okay? I survived the doctor. Well, let's get to that pharmacy before it closes... And bring you home to get some rest, huh? Sylvie? Hello? Sylvie? Um...here we go. Oh. Right? Thank you. Thanks. What is she up to? Sylvie? Oh. Sylvie? Oh. Found her. Oh, Sylvie. Fuck. Sylvie. Sylvie. Get up. Get up! Oh. Oh. What did you take, huh? Sylvie. Oh, god. Oh, my god. Get your undies up. That's it. That's it. Oh, oh! Shit! Aah! Okay. Okay. All right. Oh, god. Oh. Oh, god. Okay. Okay, we can handle this. All right, sweetie. Come on. What did Jerry give you, honey? Huh? What did he give you? If he did this to you, I’m gonna kill him. Everything okay? Uh, just a minute! Uh... Oh, god. What's happening in there? E-Everything is... Not all right. It's Sylvie. She's, uh, epileptic, and she, uh, had a fit and hit her head, uh, while she was on the toilet. And she would be so humiliated if she knew you knew. But I-I can't lift her on my own. Could you? Oh, Jesus. Oh, my god. You ... Uh, okay. Okay. Um, uh... I'll lift her up. You call 911. No, no need to call a doctor. They're always so useless, you know? Always suspecting the worst. Um, no, we'll just get her up, and ... come on. Come on, baby. Okay. Okay. Okay. Oh. Okay. All right. Now we just walk her around a bit till she comes to. What? Yeah. Yeah. It happens all the time with epileptics. It does? Oh, yeah. Okay. Come on, sweetie. Come on. That's my girl. Thank you so much, Becket. J-Just ... wait ... just pick her up, down the stairs. Can you help? O-Okay. I got it. Okay. I've got it. Okay. Oh, oh. My back. Okay. I've got it. Got her. Okay. Okay. We got her. Just get her walking, now, Becket. We've got to get her walking. Come on, girl. Come on. Sylvie? Come on. Wake up. Sylvie. Come on, baby. Snap out of it, girl. Come on. Oh. Oh, oh. Aah. Okay. Okay. Okay. I got it. All right, let's just put her here. Put her down here. Right here. Okay. Okay. Okay. Watch your hand. Down. I'm gonna put her down. Aah. Aah. Aah. Ohh, oh. Oh. Come on. Snap out of it. Come on, Sylvie. Come on. Becket, slap her. Slap her as hard as you can. No, I'm not comfortable d... Just do it. Oh! That's it. That's great. Sylvie? Good job. Sylvie? Come on. Aah! Fuck! That's the way. Aah. Why did you do that? It's okay. It's okay. Shit. This happen a lot? Well, this is pretty bad. Not usually this bad, no. She's really very upbeat. Ugh, some shit Jerry gave me. Is she gonna be okay? It didn't help my back. Yeah, yeah, she's gonna be fine. We're just gonna get her up, and, uh, get her to bed. Let her sleep it off, huh? Should we put something between her teeth, you know, in her mouth? That's a great idea. This never would have happened if I had my real medicine. I know. You know, she hit her head pretty hard on that tub. You think I could grab a few of your pain pills for when she wakes up? Oh, absolutely. Yeah, I've always been pretty squirrelly about taking medicine. Fay, is that you? Yes, sweetie, that's me. Oh, god. You smell like skunk. I don't smell like skunk. It's the compost, honey. Ugh. O-Okay, sweetie. All right. You want a towel? It smells so good. You shouldn't be cooking, though. No, I love to do it. You don't deserve all these distractions. Being with you's not a distraction. I enjoy it. You're such a strong woman. D-Do I smell like skunk, or anything? No. No, you smell great. You ... you smell like your plants. Maybe a little bit like barf. Do I smell like rubbing alcohol, or plaster? I-I worry about body odor sometimes. I'm not sure. Let me see. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Mm. I should do something about my beard. No, no. I'm ... I'm sorry. I'm sure you meant to kiss Sylvie. She made you the cake. She's younger. My aim is terrible, but I’m pretty sure I meant to kiss you. N-No, you must just be confused because of your... Hand hurting so much and everything. Hello? Ms. Worth? Who's calling? Is this fay? Yes. This is Dr. Marquez, and I would like you to make an appointment to come see me as soon as possible. Oh. Yes, i-I'll do that. Uh, thank you for calling. Solicitor. Oh, you are such a nice guy. I think I'd better go to bed now. O-Okay. Sure. Yeah. Um... Yeah. No, I understand. Me, too. Um... I have a little work I should do. Thank you. Good night. That's all? For now. I want to mail these. No shit. Excuse me? What the fuck did you just say to me? If you ever go near my daughter again, I will kill you. Are you threatening me? Yes. That's what I thought. You got to keep your daughter away from me. She's the one begging me for my shit. I help her out. You should be thanking me. With a dull knife. What? Do not go near Sylvie! Yo, how long's the wait for a Pierce? Hey, man, how's it goin'? Ooh, what's up? Good to see you, man. I'll be right with you. Here's a doughnut while you wait. Sweet. Anything flammable or breakable? Nope. Anything that could explode under pressure or is otherwise hazardous? Nope. They're all about five grams. Hmm. That makes it easy. I-i-I'm so sorry. Oh, fuck. And listen, the next one ... It's on us. Ugh. Like I'm ever fucking coming back here. The d.E.C. Got my samples ... My research. They found it troubling and important that fluorinated compounds used in fracking chemical solutions turned up in the Hudson river watershed. Oh. They want to meet with me to discuss more. No one's ever answered me before. Oh! I took your advice, and I focused on one thing ... fracking chemicals in the Hudson. This is it! I'm so happy for you. Oh, for us ... for all of us. I'm so glad I met you... ...and Sylvie. Having someone to share this with. Aw. Hey, come outside with me. No, I can't. I ... No, no, no one's here. We'll put one of those "back in a half-hour" signs on the door. When was the last time you walked down here? Oh, a few weeks ... months ago, I guess. Uh, th-there was music over there, I think. You know, the truth is...I haven't been down to the water in ages. Mmm. What would we be without all this? Right? Huh? Even the heavens come from this river. Everything's connected. One person poisons the river, everyone suffers, for generations. Nothing is more important than this water. No? That must make things pretty easy for you. Thought there was a bathroom. You know, Sylvie's got a lot of great qualities, once you get closer to her. Yeah, I'm sure she does. You're her mother. She's got a great sense of humor. She's so good with kids and pets. Brave as she can be about her health problems. She has your beautiful eyes. A little ... a little bit of you around the ... around the mouth. I, uh... With you...She ... she... ...has some self-esteem problems, but you wouldn't know it. She's... There's nothing you wouldn't do for her...To make her happy...'cause you are an incredible mother. Oh, I failed her in the beginning, and I've got to make it right. Ohh. W-We don't deserve you. I ... I ... I don't ... don't deserve you. You deserve better. Because I'm such a catch? No. Because you're so hopeful. I don't want this to be awkward for Sylvie, or ... I don't want her to get upset, o-o-or confused, so let's just keep this to ourselves for now. Hmm? Sure. Yeah, I understand. I think. You know, if she just thinks you're attracted to her, even though that may never be so, um... Sylvie won't know. Don't worry. She's gonna be so excited about how well your hard work is paying off. Will you let me take you out to dinner tomorrow night, to celebrate ... just the two of us? On a date? You mean, out somewhere? Yes. No, it's been a long time for me, too. I think I was in college the first time ... last time I was on a proper date. Proper date? Sure. I mean, yes. I'd love to. Oh, no. What are you doing with my stuff? Oh, hi, there. What stuff? D... what stuff? Are you serious? Wh... Excuse me. Oh, oh, I'm sorry. That makes sense now. I just ... I've been a little bit out of it since the seizure. I just ... I thought that those might have been granddad's old things. Did you get Becket's medicine I left you? We need money. No, we do not. We're fine right now. What ... what are you thinking? We don't need all of this. We need pots and pans. We don't need this thing. Well, nobody's gonna buy that, silly. Somebody might. You all right, Becket? I'm really sorry I sold your backpack, Becket. I want to replace it. I'm gonna sell some of my blood to get you one. You don't have to do that. I-It's just a bag. It's not a big deal. Sylvie, that's not a good idea. Well, I have to do something for you, or I'll feel so bad. Fay and I are gonna take you to Canada. I have it all planned out. It's gonna be a blast. That is very sweet of you, honey, but I don't think that's a very good idea, either. It used to be your favorite thing to do, mom. I think it's a great idea. I do. I've never been. I've always been looking for a reason to go. It's supposed to be beautiful. Maybe some other time. I don't even know if grandma's car would make it there, at this point. Come on, mom. Becket wants to go. Why are you so against going? No reason. Be fun. I-I ... why not? It might be fun. Should I grab that? N-No. U-Unless ... are you expecting a call? No. I'll get it. Hello? Fay worth, please. Speaking. This is Dr. Marquez calling again. You never made a follow-up appointment with me. And I have some concerns I need to address with you in person. I see. Uh, I'll drop by soon. Thank you so much. Hello? Hello? Yes. Yes? Uh, h-hello. Yes, this is him. Oh, my. I called you in because I'm very concerned about you and your daughter. And that's very nice of you. How old-fashioned. I feel that there could be prescription-drug abuse going on. I never received a report from your orthopedist. I never saw you again after your shoulder injury. And I know Dr. Kinski and a lot of the pharmacists in town. M-M-My shoulder's feeling much better now, and I... Been very busy. I just figured I would save on the co-pays. Fay. I've been your doctor for a while. I wanted to tell you that you're not alone, that there are treatments for your daughter. She doesn't want treatments. She ... she doesn't need treatment. She's feeling much better now. What she needed was for a doctor to show some concern, take some responsibility, figure out w-w-what had happened after her injury ... why she was in so much pain. How about that? She is an addict. She is in pain. Maybe, but she is an addict. And the kind of pain that accompanies is intractable. She may not want treatment. She may not know what she wants. And this isn't a life for you, either. My life? My life is just fine, thank you. If this happens again, I will have to report you. This is a small medical community, and we are all under scrutiny here. I ha... what are you doing here? I have a doorbell, you know. It's right here. Works and everything. May I come in? You need something to help you sleep, get horny, what? I'd like to come in. Now is not a good time. Just let me in. Kids, this is one of daddy's neighbors who needs to borrow a cup of sugar. It's my weekend with the kids, so don't fuck this up for me. Well, I'm sorry. I just assumed you weren't related to anyone. I came over to ask you to move. Move at least one county away from my home as soon as possible. Are you high? I have one of the packages you tried to send from my store locked away. And I have you on surveillance tape bringing in the packages and mailing them. You are a dealer. And I'm gonna have you put away if you don't move out. That's tampering. Yeah. Fuck. Isn't that tampering with official shit? Hello? Hey, I'm sorry to call so late, but you'll never guess where I am. Where? The city. In New York City? No. Albany. They wanted me to come up right away. Oh, wow. So I meet with the guys from the d.E.C., and they thank me for my work. They corroborated my findings with their own. They fired the local watershed officials. And they said they want me to stay up another day or so to discuss more. Well, that's great. I ... I knew you would do what you wanted to do. What we wanted, right? That's right. You know, I was a fool to think this was gonna change. Business as usual. It's not gonna go any further than the regional d.E.C. It's just a blip. You know, I made a blip. I wanted to make a wave. What you did matters. You're just beginning. I see you making waves. You're...a doer untethered. You, uh ... you should do what you're doing. You should stay. Well, I'm ... I'm gonna be back for the Canada trip. I-I took a couple days off work. Don't feel like you have to come back for that trip. Really. Just forget about us. No, I'm coming back. We're going to Canada together. Sure. Congratulations, Becket. Why are you being so weird? Mm, i-I'm not. Hey, um... How's ... how's your circulation? H-Have you noticed anything since, uh ... since we had intercourse? What? No. Should I? Well, all, you know, kinds of endorphins get released that, uh, gives you renewed energy. It's ... I mean, it's good for a-all your body functions, really. Did you have sex with me instead of jogging or something? No. Of course not. No. That's not what I meant. No, I think ... I think you're beautiful. Like I said you ... You should just do your work. You've got your whole life ahead of you. What ... what is this all about? Nothing. I-I'm just tired, and...Good luck. You look like a beautiful young woman. Thanks. You look good, too, mom. You know, uh... I am quite sure Becket is not going to make it. He, uh, has so much going on. We'd go anyway, right? Hello? I'm home. We missed you! Oh, oh. Me, too. Wait right there. I have something for you. W-W-Where are you going? Be right back. I know it's not as nice as the one you had, but I thought you might like it. I do. I love it. Where did you get the money for that? Is there something in here? Once a mom, always a mom. I got, uh, a really big thank-you tip from the mom of my new baby. That's great. Big bonus. You deserve it. When did this happen? A few days ago, you said? Yep. Yeah, I, um ... I packed us some snacks for our trip to Canada. Nice. Thanks, Sylvie. Yeah, I kept it light, since you're injured and all. Just some nuts and berries and things I thought you might like. So nice of you, Sylv. I-i-i-i just love the color and everything about it. Well, I have some good news, too. I picked up my car from friends upstate, so we can take that to Canada.

Always. I'm sorry. I-I don't know why Sylvie wanted to come here instead of some place a little more Canadian. I think she thinks this is the kind of place you would like. Well, I'm having a good time. I mean, I'm dying to let all these guys free, but I’m enjoying the whole trip. I missed you. Well, it's getting late. We should probably head home. It's a long trek. All right. All righty. Oh, I just need to stop at the drugstore and get some tampons and candy bars before we go. They're like 500 times cheaper here in Canada. Let's do it. Oh, god. Ugh. Fay, you coming? D-Did you lose something? Oh. Uh... All right. Be right back. I feel like your driver. You want to come up here? Sylvie rides better in the front. I can't stop thinking about us. You know, she gets pretty carsick, so... Let's move in together. We already live together. I don't want to rent a room from you. I want to share a room with you. I-I don't know. I ... what about Sylvie? I can't do this. I ... pretending there's nothing between us. I'm gon... I'm gonna have to move out. That's okay. I-I understand. All your work and everything. I've never loved a person more than I've loved trees before. I'm old. I ... I'm a fuck-up. I am not forgivable. You're not a fuck-up. You're incredible. What's there to forgive? Do you love me? I think you better go back up front. Yes. Sorry that took so long. Ah, god. I love Canada. Everything is so much cheaper. That's excellent. All right, I got everyone presents. Maple-leaf hats. There's one for you. And coffee crisp candy bars. Let's listen to the radio. What do you think ... should we turn it? No. This is perfect. It is? Hi. Hi. All three of you U.S. Citizens? Uh, yes, sir. Passports, please. What's the relationship of everybody in the car? Uh, I'm the roommate of these two, who are, uh, mother and daughter. What was the nature of your trip into Canada today? Just a day trip. Sightseeing. Shopping. Did lots of shopping. Everything's so fucking cheap up here. We shop here all the time. Mom. What kind of shopping? I don't know. What did you buy in Canada? Just tampons and candy bars. And medicine. The good kind. That's it. Pull in over into spot number one. Unlock all the doors on the vehicle. Leave your bags and belongings in your vehicle. Mom, what the fuck did you do? What are you doing? What's happening here? All three of you, sit down. Whose is this? Uh, that's his. Mine. Whose is this? Mine. Whose is this? Hers. Describe your relationships for me once again. This is my daughter. And this is Becket, our new... Roommate. Uh, no relation. My daughter asked him to go to Canada with us. What's going on here? Officer, my daughter bought those drugs. He had nothing to do with this. He had no knowledge of anything. What? That's a lie. She's lying. They're both lying. The drugs were in his bag, right? Wait, what was ... what was in my bag? I'm sor... what's ... what's happening? I'll decide who's lying here. But for right now, none of you is going anywhere. I can explain. You're too good for us. I'm so ashamed. I hate you! I can't believe you would do this to me! We had a plan! It was your idea to use Becket, not mine! You need me! I don't need you! Can you please tell me what's going on, fay? They're gonna lock me up, mom! I'm in pain! How am I gonna get my medicine? Can I please just have just a minute of your time? Please? Against my newfound better judgment, go ahead. I'm sorry. I am so sorry. I never meant for all this to happen. Is any part of you real? Were you using me the whole time? Am I a complete fool? No. No, no, no. You are not a fool. I thought you could help Sylvie. I was the fool. You made me want to be a part of the world again. I just ... I wanted to apologize... And to see you again. Hey. What you did at the border was brave. I don't think I could have done it. I'm not even brave enough to call my family. You know, I just selfishly don't stay in touch with them because i-i-i want to pretend to be who I want to be and not some guy who...Is just average and... Relates better to...Nature than he does to human beings. I just thought you must be really hard-up to want to live with us ... either that or you're just not so lucky with the ladies on account of your... Naturalness. I smell? Oh, like low tide. It won't smell so good, you guys, but it's gonna make you healthier and happier. I'm sorry, but your daughter doesn't want any visitors. I am not a visitor. I made her. This process isn't easy for anyone ... not the patient, not the family. I just need to know if she hates me.
