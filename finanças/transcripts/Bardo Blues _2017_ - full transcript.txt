- How much? - 3000 Baht, or 85 American dollars.. That's a great deal. A massage like that back in the states would cost a lot more. 20 bucks. - English? - Hello. - Hello. Can I check in? Can I check in now? This is a hotel, right? So, do you have a room available? Is there a secret hand shake? Okay, you gonna stop messing with me? I'm exhausted, man. If you have a room, I would like to pay for a room. That's how hotels work. - One moment. - I am so sorry. Our overnight desk clerk doesn't speak English But let's start over. My name is Gabriella and I am the owner of the Hotel Kok. - Nice to meet you. - The name under your reservation? - Jack Shore, I'm the guy that needs a hotel room. - We just need your passport, and then could you fill out this form? I didn't think any planes got in this late, long night? - First night in Thailand, go big or go home, right? - Room is 207, don't hesitate to ask if you need any help. If it's your first time in Thailand it's easy to get lost, so I'm happy to point you in the right direction. - Thank you, I'll keep that in mind. - Your room is just up the stairwell, down the hall and on the left. - You've been working so much lately, let's get the hell out of here. - You still want to go to Thailand? - Why not, it's supposed to be beautiful. - Who's gonna pay for it? - From Gabriella. - Thank you. Hey. - Hi. - What would you like? - English, nice. How about a coffee? Oh hey, I don't suppose that you've seen this woman? - Photo isn't very good. But no, I don't think I've seen her. Who you looking for? - Just someone, thank you. See ya. - Oh, you know what, there's coffee and breakfast at the hotel, if I failed to mention that last night, I'm so sorry. - Nah, no worries, it was, you know, three a.m. when I checked in, so. - Did you sleep? - No, I didn't sleep. - Jet lag? - Yeah, jet lag. Shouldn't you be at the hotel just in case any more you know, non-Thai speaking idiots like me need a room? - No, I write best at sunrise. And the planes don't come in for a couple hours, so, I am safe from English speaking tourists. - What are you writing? - Well, it's a novel of sorts. - Really, what's it about? - You really want to know? It's about man's desperate attempt to find one's self. - Is that all? - That's not enough? - Have a nice day. - When you're not in a hurry, I'd love to tell you more. - You know I'd like that, I'm a writer as well, so. - Really, well you have a beautiful day. - Shouldn't be too hard, huh, supposed to be paradise? - Most of the time. - Where is Jess going again? - Uh, trade convention, Chicago. - I thought she was tying to cut down on work trips. - She is, they're just understaffed right now. - Maybe they could hire Jack. - Very funny. - I wasn't laughing. - I love that she's so passionate about what she does, but we just wish she was around more. I mean, we don't need the money. - It's not about the money if she loves what she's doing. - What about you, you got anything on the horizon? - No, can't get any of these agents to bite on the specs I've been sending out. - I don't know why anybody ever paid you, to be honest. Do you know back in school I used to write his English papers for him? Never knowing he'd actually become a writer. - Brett, how are rehearsals for the school play? - Oh, um, great, just hope mom doesn't miss our big night. - She'll be back. - Go ahead, tell him. - Elizabeth, come on, don't do this in front of Brett. - Sorry Brett. Tell Trevor where you want to go. - Elizabeth isn't sold on the idea yet, but I want to go to Thailand. - What? - Is this city hall? - Yup. - Um, I'm looking for an American woman. - American, there's a lot of American women live in Chaing Rai. - Right, this one never came home. Can you check if there are any businesses registered in her name? - There. - Uh, I don't speak Thai. - She English? - American. - Look at this, American name. - Okay, so can you just tell me where there's another place I where I can find any information on an American? - Maybe ask another American? - Nice. Great city hall, bro. - Hey, everything okay with you and Elizabeth? - Yeah, we're good. - All right, we are talking about Thailand later, okay? - Goodnight Uncle Jack. - Goodnight Brett. - I'll see you this weekend, bro. - See you, Trev. - Bye. - See you, Brett. - You know, customs isn't gonna let you bring drugs into Thailand. - I had no idea, thank you for that. - Can you even go two weeks? - Elizabeth, I'm tired of apologizing. - Yeah, well, I'm not tired of hearing it quite yet. - What can I get you? - Entrepreneur, huh? I like it, uh, beer, please. - Thai Beer? - Is there any other kind? - You human. - You too, buddy. - You human. - What are you talking about? - Only humans come here. - I can see that. He's human, he's human, he's human, he's human. We're all human. - Nick. - Jack. - Jack, awesome. - Why is that awesome? - I dunno, I was. Okay, are you backpacking through Thailand, or? - No, I'm here for the study abroad program for assholes. - That was really funny. Let me guess, uh, you're looking for some weed. - What makes you think that? - Well, I don't know, you're a GQ looking mother fucker flashing beaucoup bucks in a Thai shithole. I mean, doesn't take a scientist. You're not here because you human. - Have you seen this woman? - This is the most beat up photograph I've ever seen in my life. - A simple no also works. - You guys seen this woman? - Back to the weed, then. - So, you going to Thailand? - That's the plan, man. - I heard it's beautiful. - Yeah, I heard that too. - Hey, Joe. - Hi Elizabeth. - Hi. ♪ Sweet baby blue, they all want to taste you ♪ - Hey babe. ♪ Sweet baby blue ♪ ♪ I want to, too ♪ ♪ I don't want you comin' ♪ ♪ Round here no more ♪ - How was work? ♪ Why don't you come 'round here no more ♪ - Don't look happy Jesus Christ, this shit again? ♪ Pick my bleeding heart off the floor ♪ - I got a confirmation email from the airline today.

Can you see that the only thing I want to fuck right now is my own mind? - I make the rules around here. - Jack, pick me tonight. - And tonight the rules are drugs and girls, or you can book a spa day at your little hotel instead. - Jack, I will make you feel good tonight, like last night. - No. - Package deal. - Fine... ...her. No. Just dance. - What is that? You're not bringing those. - Gotta look sharp when you sleep. - Trevor, you've been married too long. - We're both taken men, right? - Actually, I wanted to talk to you about Elizabeth.

What about this? - What is that? - We're going to Vegas. - Thought we were going mountain biking. - No, how about we just go to Vegas? Dude, I could be your wingman. - Vegas is the last place I want to go. - Good morning. - Morning. - How are you doing today? - I'm swell. - You know, people come here for so many reasons. What's yours? - Why are any of us here, lady? - I meet countless tourists coming through. You look like you're here to stay. Is that you? - I haven't decided yet. - Why not? - What happened to your pep talk on the roof about how the customer is always right, or is that just for the help? - I've just never seen someone look so sad in such a beautiful place. I just thought maybe you needed someone to talk to. - Thank you, but no thank you. - Okay. - Espresso. - Are you okay? - I'm fine. - No hello? Is something wrong? - I would appreciate it if you'd stop following me, and please stop prying into my personal business. - Okay, did I say something wrong yesterday? - How about five minutes ago while we were having breakfast at the hotel. - I don't know what you're talking about. I've been here all morning. - Five minutes ago while we were having breakfast you told me what a sad a human being I was being. - No, five minutes ago you weren't here. - At the hotel. We were both at the hotel! - Okay, you don't look well, do you want to come and sit down, we'll talk about this? - I think maybe later, thanks. - You need to pay. - I will. Give me my space. - Hey man, you come pay? - Come on man, what do you hope to accomplish going to Thailand? - Subject closed, Trevor, back it off. Can you unlock the door? - Seriously, my grandma thinks your hot. My grandma thinks you're like smoking hot, right. Hey Jack, what's up buddy, you want a beer? - Yeah, definitely. - What's up loner dude? - Hey dude. - Of course some Thai beer. Is there any other kind? That guy, he's a character. Let me grab a chair real quick. Hey, can I borrow this chair? I've been meaning to ask you, like why are you here? - I'm just taking a break from life, man. - Life, dude? I know why you're really here though. Don't you even sit here and tell me you're not here because you want some more of that green. - No, massage parlor across the street has me set. - She takes all my business. - Where are you off to next, man? - Do I need a fucking itinerary to drink here? - Whoa, I was just trying to figure out if you're the exploring type. - Obviously. - Obviously, right. All right, well then you're gonna love this. We're gonna go check out this cave on the outside of town. Inside the cave there's this Ascended Master guy. This crazy folklore, people have been seeing this guy walk around for like over 2000 years. - He's totally at peace, man. Couldn't you do with some of that shit? - Are you guys serious? - Yeah dude, we're serious. It's like this legend, or I guess it's more like a folktale, or whatever but-- - Like a ghost. - Did anybody say ghost, did I say ghost? It's not a ghost, it's an ascended master. He's ascended. - What does that mean? - It means you no longer carry your past inside you. - Yeah, okay, in layman's terms, you become pure light. Like, you know what I mean? There are no obstacles for the Ascended Master. - Huh? - He's like Buddha. Who gives a shit, man? We're going to a cave and we're getting drunk, you in? - Yeah dude, you should have just said that. - Yeah! - Drunk in a cave. - Drunk in a cave. - So where you been sleeping, exactly? You'll stay with Jess and I until you get things figured out. - So, forever? I don't need your charity, bro. - It's not charity, you're my brother. But it better not be forever. - Lemme guess, you haven't moved since I saw you here yesterday and your last chapter is finished? - Not quite, let me guess, you haven't slept because your mind has been running on drugs, beer, and women. - That's not fair. I made an educated guess, you have the luxury of smelling the beer sweating from my pores. You want a cup of coffee? - Sure. - Can I smoke? - I can handle it. You're not having breakfast at the hotel again? - Not after yesterday. - Yesterday? - Thank you. Let's not ruin this. - Okay. - You love it here? - I do, I like the serenity, the beauty, the peace, everywhere. - Not everywhere. - Well, there are two sides to this place but I like to acknowledge the bright side. We all have a choice in that, don't you think? - You're really a writer, you're not just another lonely lady with a note book? - Yeah, I'm really am a writer. - Sorry. - Is that why you are here? - It's not why I came, but it could be why I stay. At least for a while. - You know, many people come here and they don't know why. Is that you? - No, I know why I am here. See, I'm close, I can feel it. I'm looking for my mother. - Any idea where she might be? - No, apparently, if you leave your kids and your husband when you're 29, and you head to Thailand you can disappear. - What kind of mother does that? - Mine. Elizabeth, Elizabeth, come on, listen, please. - No, I don't care. You understand me, I don't care if you pay me back. - Just Elizabeth, just come with me to Thailand, please. - You're a fucking addict. It's over, all right, stop calling me. How many times do have to tell you? I should have left you - Elizabeth, Elizabeth. Please. - years ago, like your mother. - You okay? Jack, come on, let's go. Jack! - Are you okay? - I'm fine. I'm just realizing as I am trying to escape the ruins of my life that there's one problem. You can't escape your own mind, that shit follows you everywhere. - Yeah, the mind never quits. I mean, it's like it's own form, until we realize that we can control it. - Yeah but, how do you control this? This thing has a mind of its own. - I know. - You know, this thing is filling my skull with so much noise. - Well, there's this man, and he's called the ascended master. - No, no, no, not you too. - Really Jack, he lives in a cave right outside of town. And if he reveals himself, the mind instantly stops, okay. No more chatter, and you're forever changed. - How does everybody know about this Ascended Master but me? - Well maybe you should find out. - Jesus Christ. - He was one too. - I have an idea. How about I go to this cave and I ask this 2000 year old man why my mother abandoned me and what I'm even doing here looking for her? - I, I think you should. Why not, you may see a sign. Often people have the signs right in front of them and they don't even see them. Maybe that's you? - It's always a pleasure talking to you. - Why beat around the bullshit? - I'm just looking to escape the bullshit. - You're not gonna find her. - Key doesn't work, man. - Key work yesterday? - Yeah. - Then key work today. Lock no change. - No, I'm telling you that the key doesn't work. Now I need to get into my hotel room. - Don't speak English. - What? - No speak English. - You just spoke English. Now, let me into my hotel room. - Go see Clare, she help you. - Can you help me? - I'm not sure anybody can help you. - What is that supposed to mean? - You still have a bill here kid. - I know and I'm gonna pay it in full. - Really? - Room seven has door problem. - Did you fix it? - His problem to fix. - We talked about this, remember? You fix the small problems so the guests can focus on more important things. - I try again. - My key isn't working and the guy at the front desk won't seem to help me, but he seems to think that you can help. - They only help those that help themselves. - What are you talking about? - I'll send someone with a key. Wait next door. - Your guest is making his problems my problems. - You created the problem to begin with. - I'm so tired of your customers bringing their bullshit issues into my house. - Just go back to your people, we're fixing it. - My people are your people, you know that. - My people choose a way out. - Fuck you, I'm telling him. - No, you can't. - Oh, can't I? - You'll take us all down, and you know that. - I am already living in hell, what does it matter to me? - Where is he? - Did you send Jack to Clare? - He need help. - She's not going to help him, you know that. - But he looking. - He needs to find what he's looking for by himself. - Wait up, you guys. You see anything yet? - Nothing but this 20 foot Buddha. - You know, from what I understand you have to ask him to change something about your life. He'll appear or something. - All right, let's see if he can change my entire life then. That sounds simple enough. - Just one thing, change one thing. - My life is one thing. It's a singular noun. - I see him! I see him guys, I see him. - No way. - You really see him? - There is no way. - I see him, there! - There's no way you see a 2000 year old man living in a cave. - You don't believe, man, that's your problem. - Yeah dude, just try believing. Just try it for five seconds. Like, everything you see is just a belief, you know. - Reveal yourself. - Try again with a little more passion. - Reveal yourself! Reveal yourself, you ascended master. I've one problem that I definitely need fixed. Please remove the asshole from my body that makes me an asshole. I believe, I believe, that I could use another beer right now. - All right well, we tried. He doesn't speak for all of us. Did you really see him? - I swear, man. - What did he look like? - Dusty. - Dusty? - Did you sleep? - All right, let's talk about you today. What's a dame like you doing in a dump like this? - Why not? - You gonna me tell you've got life all figured out? - Certainly. - Okay, I know what you're writing about. You're writing about how your wealthy husband left you for a transgender priest living in Oslo. - Close. - Well, now you know what kind of book I'd read. - Really? - I know what you should write about. You should write about how pharmaceutical companies are bribing the doctors to overprescribe anti-depressants and ADD medication. - I feel like you may know a little bit more about that than you'd like to. - You know, they've just been such a big part of my life for a such a long time. It's hard to get off the treadmill. - Yeah, I guess the only thing we can do is end our own vicious cycle. I mean, if each person did that. - Were you a kindergarten teacher in your past life? - I know it sounds overly simplified, but karma or whatever you want to call it, It catches up with you. Even if someone doesn't see it, you are, quite simply, the sum of your choices. - Will you just sit up front with me? This is crazy. - Just ask already. - I shouldn't have to ask, you know that, right? You should just tell me. Okay, is it an insurance thing, like you can't get 'em, or is it a fuck you meds? Or is this one of your I don't need them-- - I don't like them. I don't like the way they make me feel. - There's gotta be some kind of solution that keeps you-- - Sedated? ♪ It's a choice ♪ ♪ To stay ♪ ♪ It's a dream ♪ ♪ And I want to wake ♪ ♪ You are blood on your hands ♪ - When we get back, I'm gonna make sure that you're covered. Dad and I'll find you a plan of some kind. Something that lets you keep your edge, so you can write, but, but also keeps you from being a dickhead. - Cool, you go find that magical little substance. - Fuck you, you need the meds. - You need me on the meds. You and dad and Jessica need to keep me as a little zombie. - That's bullshit and you know it. - Let me out of this car. - We're almost there. - If you don't let me out of this car I'm jumping out. - You're not gonna jump out. Jack, Jack, dammit. Jack. (pop music in the background. - Buddy, bad news, I'm all out of weed. But we can probably go score some across the street, I think. - I was kind of hoping to could avoid that place tonight. - Sorry dude, but if you want weed. - Hey, have you seen this woman? - Maybe you should ask her in Thai. She might have thought you were just trying to give her a photograph. - Opium and the same gal, eh? - No, just some weed. - Aww, my girl not fuck you right last night? - It was fine, can I just have a hit and a massage? Just a massage. - I'll discount her tonight. - No, thank you. - $5 for a blow job. - Who do you think you are, lady? You can't force me to fuck a prostitute. - My name is Clare. - Okay, Clare, can I just get a hit and a massage, without anyone trying to touch my dick, please? - Yes, tonight that will be acceptable, room 10. - Thank you. No, no, I said no. - But I want to. - I said stop, okay, get off me. Get off me. Get off me. Hey, man, I'm waiting on some money to come through from back home. Is there anyway I could have-- - No problem, you good man. - Let's not get crazy, but thank you. Okay, nothing spiritual today, let's just talk about the weather. - And that's not spiritual? - I miss the weather back home. - Where's home? - Los Angeles. - Really? - But I'm originally from Vermont. - What did you do last night? - How I spend my days are different than how I spend my nights. - Jack. Hey. - Give me the keys. I'm driving, give me the keys. - If I give you the keys you'll get back in the car? - Yes. - Hey, hey, listen to me, we're almost there. It's right up this hill. I've been here before, you're gonna love it. - We're going home. - What, I'm driving. - If you want to drive, I'm walking home. - I'm driving. Okay, okay, fine, you're driving. - What chapter are you on? - You said you can't talk about anything spiritual. - Okay, I got it, I got it, I got it. - Is there anything else off limits? 'Cause I'd hate to ask the wrong question. - Okay, let me see the book, let me see it. Life and death are the same after you rid yourself of your karmic energy. - Consider Pandora's Box opened. - One minute. - My boss say you have to pay now. - I will, just let me just send this, and I'll get you your money. - No, leave now, no money, no computer. Get out! - Do you recognize this-- - No, no, no, leave now, leave now. Get out of here. - Just face it Trevor, I'm a fuck up. No job, no life, no girl, no home. - Take it easy, slow it down. - Don't tell me what to do. - No, I, I'm not, just slow it down. - I am not a kid anymore. - Nobody said you were. Come on man, I have a family at home, slow down! - A short and a tall. - Jackie! - What, no Thai beer? - Hey man, what's up buddy? - I never thanked you for that trip you sent me on. - Dude, I'm glad you liked it. - Oh, I loved it man, the scenery, fresh air. - Well, we're gonna re-up again in like an hour in my room. - That means I got like an hour to get a bunch of women and booze up to your hotel room. - I think you can handle it. - Dude, I can handle it. - Perfect, well I'm gonna get things started. - Trevor! - Get out of my bag, dude. - Are you serious? - Yeah man, we did it all, it's gone. What time is it? - It's like six. - I think it's a little early to start another bender, don't you. Dude I like you, you gotta get your shit together. - This from a drug dealer. - Why are you here, man? - I'm trying to do more drugs, but my drug dealer is being an asshole. - No, I mean, you don't belong here. Like why did you come here? - You know why I'm here man, I'm looking for my mother. - Drugs help you find your mother? - No. - So, why are you here? - I killed my brother. It was an accident. - Jesus. - You gonna help me or not? - I can't dude. I only assist in drugs that help. - Fuck you, they are helping.

I can take a credit card over the phone and we can at least start preparing him for the funeral. - You came back, surprise. - I don't want any more women. Just give me the stuff. - Stuff, now, now, Jack, say please. - You aren't my mother, lady, sell me the drugs. - No, it's a package deal, you know that Jack. - You're a drug dealer and I need drugs, do your job. - You don't tell me what my job is, young man. For starters, you've have an open tab here that I have so generously extended. And second, if you want your stuff, you take it my way. - What is going on here? - I know what you need, Jacky boy. - Fuck you. - You need a woman, Jack! - Fuck you, lady. - Put him on the phone, put him on the phone now, Jack. - I'm so sorry, dad. - Put him on the phone now, now, no. - Hey. You're probably the only person I haven't asked. Have you seen this woman? - Don't know white people in Chiang Rai, only you. - You know Gabriella. - And Clare. - Oh, thanks for meeting me here. - No worries, I needed some fresh air. - How are you feeling? - I've been okay, I've been good. I've been sober for three days. - Well that's great, okay, I want to show you something. We' re all on a path that is ever evolving and one has to accept that. Life is just about repeating old patterns until they're broken. - You know, I live in this state of perpetual movement. See I am on a bike! Am I learning? - Yes! - I guess the question really is, at any given moment what direction are we going? - Yeah but, we have to be going somewhere, right? This can't be all there is. - You know, Jack, you can trust me. - I know, oddly enough, I know that. - Talking about your brother can really make you feel better. - How did you know about my brother? - Well, men say strange things in the throes of withdrawals. - I don't know what to say. I killed my brother and I hate myself for it. It's been 12 days, and I'm finally feeling something. Not better, but something. - Let's go in the temple. - Tried finding any business owned by an American and the owner of the hotel was trying to help me, but you know, no such luck. - Have you tried the whore house? That's run by an American. - I don't think my mother is running a whore house in Thailand. - I knew I could find you here. You know, you have a bill you need to pay up. - I will, the money is on its way. - Fine, take him. I'm done waiting for you to choose, Jack, you choose now. - The money is coming, okay. My father is sending me money. - I don't care about the money, son. This is all I care about. Throw him over there. - You'll be taking this to the airport for us tonight. - Are you out of your fucking mind? Why are you people doing this to me? - You either take that to the airport, or the next delivery you make will be from inside that cooler. - No, no, no, you people are crazy. - Jackie, don't be so dramatic. He is waking up, get him, get him. We are not getting caught. - It's you, the whole fucking time it's been you. - I've been here for you the whole time son, come home. Get him, get him now! Bring my baby home! - I need help. - Finally, you see I can help you. - No, this isn't a joke, is there a place that I can hide? - You cannot hide forever, Jack. - Help me, please help me! - It's time to wake up. - Where is the back door? - Hello Jack. - What are you doing here? It doesn't matter, okay, I have to get out of here. - Where? - Anywhere! Is there a place that I can hide? - So you're choosing my help? - Yes. - You're choosing help? - Jesus Christ, yes! I'm choosing you and your help. - Come with me. Jack, you have to forgive yourself for killing your brother. - Forgive myself, here, now? - It's the only way to break the cycle. You haven't paid your debt spiritually. It's not money that you owe, okay. You can't bargain yourself out of this. - Just please stop. - You can't escape anymore. You need to decide if you want to live in heaven or hell. - What does that mean, what kind of choice is that? - It's the choice you made when you went back into the massage parlor over and over, why did you do that? - How do you know that? - Jack. - No, answer me. - She is not gonna help you. She's only gonna take you further into hell. - Who, the prostitute? - Your mother. - How do you know she's my mother? - How did you not know? What does that say about her, what she is and what she's done to you? Where you actually are. Do you know where you are Jack? Where are you going? Jack, come back. - Hey dad. I don't need your charity, bro. - Jack, where are you going, Jack? - You have to accept what you did. Just open the package. - I don't want to. - Because you know what's in it. Just open it, please. Open the package. - Oh my God, I did that. - You did. - So I'm dead, I've been dead this whole time? - Yes, you'll never quiet the mind. Until the mind quiets. - It's not that easy. - It can be. Just forgive yourself and you can be free. Then you get out of Bardo. - I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. - I know, it's all right bro. You just have to make one more step before you're truly free. - What are you doing here? - I have always been here, Jack, always. I am you. I was you in your last life. There we realized everything we see and perceive is a reflection of our karma. But when we are reborn, you forgot it all again. Jack, you cannot escape it now. You can't escape me. This is Bardo. You will keep on living these aspects of your life over and over again until you reconcile or eradicate your darkness. Wake up, Jack, this is your choice. - My choice. It's my choice to live in heaven or hell? Why didn't I choose to live? Because I couldn't live with myself anymore. So now I have to forgive myself for killing my brother. Forgive myself for taking my own life. I just thought I escaped life, but life never stops. It just changes dimensions. I didn't know I was dead when I entered the hotel. I didn't know every time I had a thought in the past it was me reviewing my life. I didn't know my mother died in Thailand. I just wanted to find her. So even in my death I was still searching. Heaven and hell is a state of mind that never ends. It's consciousness. It's just consciousness, either in life or in death. Well I guess now that I've awakened to that, let's get the hell out of here and get to heaven. ♪ Wake me, wake me up ♪ ♪ Wake me up when we get there ♪ ♪ Wake me up, wake me up ♪ ♪ Anything goes in the neon south ♪ ♪ Four nights and three days ♪ ♪ It's an odyssey though just the same ♪ ♪ But in a colored room to turn you over ♪ ♪ Purple face but my smile remains ♪ ♪ Wake me up, wake me up ♪ ♪ Wake me up when we get there ♪ ♪ Wake me up, wake me up ♪ ♪ Anything goes in the neon south ♪ - You're up early. - I didn't sleep. - Jet lag? - Jet lag?
