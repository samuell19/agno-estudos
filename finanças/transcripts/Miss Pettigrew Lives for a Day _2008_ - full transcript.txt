BRUMMEGAN: Miss Pettigrew, I was warned of you stubbornness and impertinence, and I shouId have known better when you were caIIed the ''governess of Iast resort. '' But I had no idea of your utter unsuitabiIity. You are dismissed. PMTTIGRMW.: But, Mrs. Brummegan... Away! AIIow me one Iast chance... Goodbye, Miss Pettigrew. I'm owed a week's wages. (WIND WHISTLING) (BOTH EXCLAIM) I say! I'm terribIy sorry! I do apoIogize. Oh, no! My things! My things! Let me heIp you with that. They'II have me back in prison for this. Oh! Oh, nothing serious. WeII, when I say serious, I... No. Wait! Your... Your beIongings! Sorry! (WOMEN CHATTERING) WOMAN: Gerry? Edythe, if you can keep your hands off him for just two seconds... We're getting our own cab, thank you. WOMAN: That's naughty! Let's get out of here, Gerry. (PLATE CLATTERING) (BELL TOLLING) (WHISTLING) Washburns. Jane, aged five. LoveIy girI. Lost in the park... Independence. That's aII that girI needs... For six hours? The RandIe boys, John and Robin. ''WrestIed retired CoIoneI Johnson to the fIoor outside Fortnum and Mason's, ''shouting, 'Nazi warmonger' because...'' And I quote, ''Miss Pettigrew thought he was a German spy.'' A IittIe joke. ''AmbuIance caIIed. PoIice caIIed.'' Yes. And now the Brummegans. Miss Pettigrew, we Iive in uncertain times. My goodness, there couId be a war any day. Do you think that work is easy to find? No, no. CertainIy not, Miss HoIt. But Mrs. Brummegan was... WeII, fond of a sherry, if you take my meaning. As a vicar's daughter, I found her rather difficuIt. No, she found you rather difficuIt, Miss Pettigrew. And that is, I'm afraid, a recurring theme. Miss HoIt? Yes, JiIIy? The Lafosse househoId rang Iast night. StiII Iooking. Thank you. Yes, I won't be a moment. A person can change. I haven't seen any sign of that. She couId stop drinking. Our cIients don't adapt to suit your needs, Miss Pettigrew, you adapt to them! I am trying, Miss HoIt. ReaIIy. Give me one Iast chance. You won't regret it. My dear woman, I aIready have. Thrice. I'm afraid we have nothing suitabIe for you at the moment. Good day, Miss Pettigrew. ShaII I come back tomorrow? The situation is most unIikeIy to have changed. The day after? OnIy if you desire the exercise. Miss HoIt. PIease, I impIore you. JILLY: Yes, Miss HoIt? Miss DarIington is finishing with CaroIe Lombard this week, isn't she? She wouId be perfect for the Lafosse residence, don't you think? JILLY: I think she wouId be an exceIIent choice. Can you refer to her fiIe for me? CertainIy. HOLT: Thank you. I said good day, Miss Pettigrew. Good day. (HORN HONKING) (ELEVATOR BELL DINGS) (DOG BARKING) Amazing. (WOMEN CHATTERING) (BELL RINGS) (EXCLAIMS) (DOOR OPENING) (EXCLAIMS) Hi. I have come from Miss HoIt's Agency. What time is it? It's five minutes past 10:00. 10:00? Five minutes past. In the morning? I beIieve so. Oh, God! DELYSIA: Oh, my God, Iook at the pIace. I was given to beIieve you were expecting me. Miss HoIt's EmpIoyment Agency? Darn right, honey. And not a moment too soon. (GASPS) AIIow me. Neat! Time? Six minutes past 10:00. Can I be of any further assistance? Not unIess you can get PhiI out of bed in the next two minutes, you can't. I've known my share of naughty boys who oversIeep. You too, huh? PhiI! It's time to wake up, darIing! Damn it! AIIow me. I can get your boy up and dressed in no time. You couId? ReaIIy? CertainIy. AngeI. One must not stand for any nonsense, that's aII. They just need to know who's in charge. First door at the top of the stairs. PhiIip? Rise and shine, PhiIip! As I said to your mother, I won't stand for any nonsense. You naughty boy, get up! (GASPS) I kind of am up, as you can see. (EXCLAIMS) (LAUGHING) Oh, goIIy! Excuse me, Mrs. Lafosse, may I speak to you? Mrs. Lafosse... (PHONE RINGING) (GASPING) Oh, heavens! Answer that, wiII you? If it's Nick, teII him... TeII him I'm dead. Good morning, this is Miss HoIt here, of HoIt's EmpIoyment Agency. I've just rung to say that one of our best women is on her way over to you now. HeIIo? (IN FRENCH ACCENT) No, no, no! That won't be necessary. I'm afraid that Mrs. Lafosse is dead. Goodbye. (CLATTERING) DELYSIA: Don't reaIIy do kitchens. Hmm. Any Iuck with PhiI? I'm so sorry, Mrs. Lafosse... DeIysia. DeIysia, I'm afraid I waIked in on your guest in a state of nature. I fear that I have outraged his sense of propriety. Oh, no, PhiI doesn't have one of those. He's a much bigger boy than I had expected. Oh, you noticed. He is, isn't he? Uh... (PHONE RINGING) HeIIo? DarIing! ReaIIy? Mmm-hmm. You, too. (PETTIGREW SHUDDERS) He's at the cIub. Be here in 10 minutes. Oh, God. Who? Nick! Another man? WeII, of course another man! Jeepers. I'm afraid there has been a misunderstanding. I can see the probIem cIearIy now and I reaIIy must be going. You do? Pardon? See the probIem. ReaIIy? WeII, yes. I knew it. From the moment I set eyes on you, I just knew I couId trust you. I can, can't I? Yes, you can. Thank you. Thank you. You've saved my Iife. Have I? Hmm. A two-pronged attack shouId do it. Let's go. Though I don't think you shouId mention about Nick. Or MichaeI. MichaeI? Is he your son? My son? Lord, no. MichaeI wants to marry me. Another man? (SHUSHING) You don't have to wake the neighbors about it. Besides, that's onIy three. PhiI's rather free about where he undresses. He's a theater producer. WeII, his father is. PhiI's got his first show on at the Ambassador. I've got the Iead. WeII... (GIGGLES) I'm pretty sure I have now. (EXCLAIMS) HeIIo again. AwfuIIy sorry about earIier. I thought you were someone eIse. That is some reIief, I suppose. JoIIy nice to meet you, dear Iady, but who the deviI are you? Who is she, gorgeous? She's, um... (LAUGHS) You know, I'm not aItogether sure. Pettigrew. Guinevere Pettigrew. Guinevere. Guinevere. Wow. Yes, but who is she? What in the worId is she doing in this particuIar bedroom when you are so obviousIy starkers beneath that deIightfuI gown, don't you know? We have... An engagement. A meeting. Meeting. Important meeting. Indeed we do. In 20. Two... Twenty-two. Not 22, Guinevere, dearest. Two minutes. What the dickens can be as important as another hour in bed with young PhiIip-me-Iad? You don't mind, do you, Guinevere? It's aII a bit new to me, and it's deviIish good fun. Besides, I have nothing tiII Iunch. Come back to bed, beautifuI. (LAUGHS) (COUGHS) (EXCLAIMS) Baby, baby, I'd Iove to, but I can't. Come on, it's an awfuIIy good cure for a hangover, I'm toId. Edythe's Iingerie show is at 1 1 :00. Anyway, haven't you got to get ready? Who are you Iunching? Nobody, reaIIy. CharIotte Warren. The Rabbit? Why? She run out of carrots? Sweetie-pops... But you said the Iead was mine. PhiI, honey, you promised! It is. It is. I'm sure it is. You're the one, baby. I just have to cIear it with Daddy, being the bounder with the checkbook and aII. You know, he wants me to meet her. Amazing voice, apparentIy. If you Iike air-raid sirens. It's just Iunch, darIing. Come on, DeIysia. Remind your producer why you're right for such a passionate part. CharIotte Warren the actress? Know her, what? I did happen to see her Iast night on Shaftesbury Avenue. With who? Who with? A man. PHIL: Producer? Mmm. Spivvy feIIow? Mmm. Nasty side-parting? Mmm. I knew it! Danny ruddy Greenwood, dash it aII. On the poach. WeII, we'II see about that. Oh, PhiI, you can't think that CharIotte Warren is right for Hortensia? Not with that damp IittIe nose. Jacket? Behind you. A quick egg and I'm off. I regret we're out of eggs. You know this? I'm afraid I do. Bacon? So sorry, no. Sausage? If onIy. Smoked haddock fiIIets? DefiniteIy not. Toast. I saw the baker's girI deIiver a Ioaf yesterday. AIIow me. Guinevere, you've got to get him out of here. We're on a deadIine. Toast is onIy two minutes. I reaIize it is not my pIace, but isn't it possibIe simpIy not to answer the door to this Nick feIIow? Oh, I can't do that. Why? It's his fIat. Oh. (CAR HORN HONKS) (GASPS) Jeepers, he's earIy! (GASPS) Toast! MarveIous. Tie? Any tea on the go, perchance? Sweets, Danny Greenwood is at this very second, sending fIowers around to CharIotte's IittIe warren. You think so? That does seem to be the producer's modus operandi. It does, doesn't it? You know the business, what? Not that you're in the Ieast bit interested in CharIotte Warren. No. No. DarIing, you're the one for me. You know that. And I don't just mean on the stage. PHIL: I say. What? DeIysia? CIean it up. DeIysia. (BUZZING) I can't go yet. I have something important to say. Just... Right now? DeIysia... Yes, my sweets? I Iove you. (SIGHS) FiddIesticks, working reIationships. You and me. How about it, oId girI? (GASPS) (CLATTERING) Don't Iet any rabbits under your fence. Bye. DeIysia? Lift up the spout? I rather think so, yes. DeIysia? Is that you? He saw the gown, damn it. I beIieve we have made it. You're a bona fide genius, Guinevere! Miss Lafosse, it has been a most exciting, one might say exhiIarating experience, meeting you, though I can't heIp feeIing one fraught with moraI compIexity. But now that the crisis has been averted, I simpIy must take my Ieave. What? Oh, you can't go. PIease don't go. The crisis is ongoing. Goodness. Guinevere... Miss Pettigrew... I don't know what I'd do if you went. I beg you. It's Nick. I need saving. Saving? Mmm-hmm. Have you ever been hypnotized by a snake, Guinevere? I don't beIieve so, no. WeII, it's what they do to smaII furry animaIs. The snake fixes the animaI with its eyes, so it has no wiII. It stays when it shouId be running. It wants to stay, even if it means death. And I am that smaII furry animaI. And Nick CaIdereIIi, coming up the stairs this very minute, is that snake. When he's here, I just... I can't resist him. And he's bad for me. So bad. And when I waver, and I wiII waver, I need you to be strong for me. PIease. Stay. I can see I have no choice. You're cIearIy in danger. Oh, thank you! But I'm afraid it is you who must be strong. You're right. I must. The time has come to break it off. And with you beside me, I feeI strong, confident, firm. There is something so sensuaI about fur next to the skin, don't you think? Mmm! Miss Lafosse, you're sIipping aIready. Strong, confident, firm. I know! But I can't heIp it. But I must. (DOOR OPENING) (GASPS) Nick! I feeI Iike I've just cIimbed bIoody Everest. The Iift's on the bIink. (DELYSIA EXCLAIMING) DarIing. It's you! That wasn't you, was it? Me? In the Iift? The Iift? Lift? Oh, you mean eIevator. That's exactIy what I... I didn't know you had company. But, Nick, I get so IoneIy when you're away. This is... Pettigrew. Guinevere Pettigrew. A pIeasure, Miss Pettigrew, I'm sure. And you are, what, a friend? I am Miss Lafosse's new governess... SociaI secretary. SociaI secretary. ReaIIy? Isn't it a IittIe earIy for camoufIage? (CHUCKLING) I beg your pardon? I haven't had the opportunity... It's nice to meet you, Miss Pettigrew, but D and I haven't seen each other for three weeks. Got a Iot of catching up to do. So if you wouIdn't mind. But of course. Good day. (DELYSIA EXCLAIMING) But, Nick, darIing! What? WeII, I've got a fashion show to get to. Haven't I, Guinevere? Fashion show be damned. Who needs cIothes, eh, gorgeous? Damned or not, I'm afraid Miss Lafosse has accepted the invitation. WeII, canceI. Come on, darIing. CIose the door on your way out. I'm sure that we can scheduIe something for Iater in the week. I beg your pardon? I think that Miss Lafosse has an hour Wednesday at 9:30. ShaII I penciI it in? No. I'm penciIing now. Nick, darIing, I'm afraid that Guinevere's right. I'm terribIy busy this morning. Oh. You haven't... You haven't had any other guests, have you? No, darIing. Just us girIs together. I thought I saw PhiI GoIdman's car outside. PhiI? GoIdman. Do we know him? Andy GoIdman's idiot boy. Pouring Daddy's miIIions away at the Ambassador on some stupid musicaI. PiIe on the PiffIe. Pepper. Pepper? I'm toId. Since when did girIs together smoke cigars? Hmm? Answer me that. If I want to smoke cigars, I'II damned weII smoke cigars, thank you very much. And to heII with your opinion. What, they're yours? You betcha, baby. (COUGHING) Oh! And you thought that I... What? Nick... You, of aII peopIe? How couId you? I'm wounded, NichoIas, I am wounded. DarIing, sweetheart. PIease forgive me. It's been a Iong night. I'm... No. I'm sorry. No. It's... It's no good. AII right, I forgive you! Fashion show. Come again? Fashion show. Fashion... Fashion show is right. And that wiII be your punishment, man of IittIe faith. You wiII have to wait. What? So I'm being thrown out of my own fIat, am I? I'm sorry, darIing. Very weII. Tonight then. At the cIub. Miss Pettigrew. Good day. Tonight is booked. You were magnificent! Are you aII right? I have never sworn before in my Iife. Not even in my mind. WeII, I didn't hear you swear. Yes, I did. I said damned and heII. And I meant them. Oh, that's not swearing. They came out of the sinfuI category an age ago. Desperation. That's what it's come to. A IittIe desperation and Iife can make of us whatever it chooses. In my case, a smoking, swearing accompIice to misdeeds in a den of iniquity. No! ReaIIy? Oh, you mean here. (LAUGHS) But I was the desperate one. I'm aIways desperate. Think of what wouId have happened if you hadn't been here. I shudder to think what goes on when I'm not here. MoraIs are very important to me, Miss Lafosse. I am the daughter of a cIergyman. Poor you. No. It was a perfectIy good upbringing, thank you. But I am beginning to think perhaps a IittIe sheItered. But it's not aIways Iike this. OccasionaIIy it's not Iike this. AII right, it's aIways Iike this. Is that so very awfuI? PIease don't go. You just can't go. This is the most important day in my whoIe Iife. I'II phone up that HoIt Iady right now and I'II doubIe your saIary. Oh, no, no, no! Thank you. That won't be necessary. I don't even know what a sociaI secretary does. I onIy got one because CharIotte ''Rabbit'' Warren's got one, so I figured I'd better get one, too. Now that I see you in action, you're just amazing. Am I? That's very kind of you to say so. PhiI, gone. Nick, gone. And that cigar. But that was fast thinking. I'm onIy happy to have been of assistance. Miss Pettigrew, I Iove you. WeII, come on! DELYSIA: Why don't you sIip something eIse on, Guinevere? I mean, nobody died, did they? Or did CaroIe make you wear that sackcIoth and ashes for contrast? Make herseIf Iook even more amazing. CaroIe? That's not a game I pIay, Guinevere, I can assure you. So, Iet's Iose the bIackout curtain, shaII we? These cIothes appear to be the onIy ones I possess. You're kidding. Shoes? I'm afraid not. Oh. So, Iet's go buy some! I'm not in a position to. Out of cash? None at aII? None at aII. Wow. You sociaI secretaries sure can spend. RouIette, was it? BIackjack? CertainIy not. WeII. Whatever, it's on me. No, no, no, I couIdn't possibIy... You sure couId possibIy. I, for one, am not running around town with OIiver Twist's mom. After the Iingerie show, we go shopping. It's so frightening. Yeah. Cap sIeeves. It's a horror show. It's a nice coIor, though. Yes, very nice coIor. Are you coId? WeII, perhaps a IittIe. Here. Oh, no, I couIdn't. No, you must. It's a IittIe thank-you for this morning. It's beautifuI. Guinevere! Don't dawdIe, we're Iate! DELYSIA: Today is the day that PhiI announces to the worId who's going to pIay the Iead in PiIe on the Pepper. And with the Iingerie that I'm about to pick up, it's no contest, honey. ''DeIysia Lafosse tops the biII!'' How exciting! Is it to be a West End show? It is to be a West End smash, Guinevere, and it's going to make me a star. PETTIGREW: I thought you were a singer. WeII, I've got a voice. But that's not how you become famous. No. First stop, West End. Next stop, HoIIywood. Have you done much of that sort of thing? Didn't you catch Mvery Day's a HoIiday? One of mine. Mae West! Oh, you did see it? Oh, yes! Which part were you? I was in the restaurant scene. In the back. ReaIIy? Behind the paIm tree drinking a margarita. I... I think they cut that for the European print. A IittIe de trop for you EngIish, if you know what I mean? Of course. Of course there's Four's a Crowd, with ErroI FIynn and... OIivia de HaviIIand! Seen that as weII? Four's a Crowd is a wonderfuI picture. Who were you? The crowd. Here we are. Quick, quick. Guinevere. Come on. Don't be shy. She's naked! WeII, hardIy. There's so much whaIebone on her, I'm Iooking for a taiI and fIippers. MD YTHM.: This season's must-have for the fuIIer figure, the SIimIastic corset and upIift brassiere. A most effective reducer. If you don't mind a coIIapsed Iung. I recognize her. Edythe? She owns the best saIon in London. AII the Iatest fashion. AII the Iatest gossip. Another sIenderizer from Aphrodite, for the winter season, is this unique wrap-around corset with side paneIs and front-to-back gussets, in fIeece-Iined rubber, with rustproof steeI spiraIs throughout. Rustproof steeI. You guys reaIIy are preparing for war. (GASPS) Guinevere? A man. In the room. Oh. Oh, that's just Joe. He designs underwear. And not these waIking air-raid sheIters. BeautifuI things. There are very few men who reaIIy appreciate the femaIe figure Iike Joe. It doesn't matter what you're wearing, he can see right through to the reaI woman underneath. Oh. Oh, this is his coIIection. And new this season from Mimi, designed by Joe BIomfieId. (AUDIENCE APPLAUDING) He's dating Edythe. Tempestuous is the word that the magazines use. I mean, of course she's a darIing, but a IittIe difficuIt. As you can see, it's going to be a chiIIy winter for Mimi fans. And in that ever-practical 100% silk, you're going to have to empIoy another maid to do the washing, Iadies. That's if you can afford one after you've paid through the nose for one of these frou-frou. Oh, dear. I guess they had another bust-up. And you'd better start your diet now because there's no hiding your induIgences, Iadies. Not a support in sight to heIp human nature. Excuse me a moment? Thank you, Iadies. Joe. Margery! So, what can you do to prop up this ancient monument? If you must taIk of ancient monuments, did you know that the EIgin MarbIes were once painted? No, I can't say that I did. Bright, garish coIors. AwfuI. Now aren't they better just marbIe, worn a IittIe into something wise, as weII as beautifuI? Joe BIomfieId, you are the worId's best fIatterer. Or maybe I'm saying you beIong in a museum. You don't tamper with a masterpiece, Margery. You aIIow it to be. That's my advice to you. (MARGERY CHUCKLING) That scarf, if I may say, Iooks perfect on you. WeII, thank you. It was a present. You know, I think it's the most beautifuI thing I've ever worn. Now the fIatterer has been out-fIattered. Sorry? It's one of mine. The design. Last year for Mimi Couture. My goodness. You reaIIy didn't know. WeII, that is a compIiment indeed, madam. Thank you. Joe BIomfieId. Guinevere Pettigrew. A pIeasure. Not to worry. (INHALES) EDYTHE: WeII, I didn't answer the teIephone because I couIdn't answer the teIephone. DELYSIA: Why not? I was in the bathroom. Having a bath? No, I just didn't answer the teIephone, and now Joe says the engagement's off. Just because of one stupid IittIe misunderstanding. Edythe, Miss Pettigrew. Edythe Dubarry. Miss Pettigrew is my new sociaI secretary. ReaIIy? How intriguing. I know. Lost her shirt pIaying poker or something. But she is the best in London. Miss HoIt toId me so herseIf. Just freed up after CaroIe Lombard finished VigiI in the Night. Isn't that right, Guinevere? I heard it's a very fine picture. Haven't we met before? I don't beIieve so. RecentIy. I never forget a face. You reaIIy shouIdn't wear those muddy browns, you know. They're not your coIor. Oh. The funeraI parIor thing? It's in hand. We're on our way to your IittIe store to correct the situation this very minute. My shop and saIon are at your disposaI, my dear. DELYSIA: Oh! Come with us! We can do Guinevere, and you can teII me aII about Joe and I can teII you about my amazing morning. Hang it aII, the bone structure's there. Why the deviI not? Beatrice, canceI my appointments. I'm suddenIy inconvenienced. Perfect! Come on, now! What is she going to do? We're going to do a fixie! EDYTHE: Turned Nick out of his own fIat? DELYSIA: She didn't Iike him. Good heavens! He Iet her? He was no match for her. My dear, the woman can do anything. Anything. No. DefiniteIy not. It's too pink, it's too passé. Not that one, either. And she's coming to the party? WeII, of course. She's going to cIinch the Iead in PiIe on the Pepper for me. Oh, no, not the red. Not with her hair, I think. But I thought you'd secured that deaI Iast night. WeII, I thought so, too. And I pIayed it magnificentIy, if I do say so myseIf. But then PhiI announced that he was going to have Iunch with the Rabbit. CharIotte Warren? Mmm. Oh, my dear. ExactIy. So you can see why I need Guinevere's powers. I do indeed. I wonder... Yes? Oh, nothing. That one! That one! Miss Lafosse? Oh! Oh! Thank you. Very nice. Guinevere, I think we're ready. And you're sure that's aII it was, Edythe, my dear? Just a Iate train? No Gerry invoIved? You're as bad as Joe. Gerry and I are finished. AbsoIuteIy finished. So Tabitha and I bumped into him at Hat Day at the races. What of it? We got the Iast train in to Victoria and that was absoIuteIy that. My fruit fedora was much admired, thank you for asking. Joe can check with the station if he's so damnabIy suspicious. Arrived at 1 1 :30 and took a taxi straight home. AIone. The whoIe thing is ridicuIous. One Iate train and the whoIe marriage is off. Men are so untrusting. I can't think why. Are you aII right? Sorry, I was just remembering something. Everything aII right, Guinevere? PETTIGREW: Oh, yes. Just a moment. (GIGGLES) This is me? AII you. As nature intended. Guinevere, controI yourseIf, for heaven's sake! The mascara! No, of course. Of course. That was cIose. WeII, I'm just gonna put this, and a few other things, on Nick's account. I'II be right back. WeII, what a transformation. I suppose I've never feIt I reaIIy deserved it. A sociaI secretary such as yourseIf? CaroIe Lombard's sociaI secretary, no Iess. EyeIiner. As you're such a wow with the men, I was wondering whether you couId have a word with Joe for me. Smooth this IittIe misunderstanding over. We're getting married, you know. Were. It wouId mean such a Iot to me. I'm afraid I couIdn't do that. ReaIIy? You and I, Guinevere, we don't have what the DeIysias of this worId have. We have to work at it, improvise a touch, act a IittIe to get what we want. You know what I mean, don't you? There. I'm sure DeIysia wouIdn't mind. DELYSIA: WeII, that shouId put a few more gray hairs on Nick's head. My, you do Iook ravishing. WonderfuI news! Guinevere has very kindIy offered to sort things out with Joe for me. But that's a marveIous idea. If anybody can make Joe see sense, Guinevere can. Isn't that right? Okay. Come on. (PIANO PLAYING) Listen. Nick? Fingers Iike bananas. PhiIip? Oh, yes. CharIotte Warren. Permit me. Thief. BurgIar. I've had some reactions to my pIaying, but never quite that. I saw you at the jaiI. I saw you. Oh, it's you! I say, I'm awfuIIy sorry about that. MichaeI! It's so good to see you. However did you get in? One picks up a few tricks in prison, you know? Breaking and entering being one of them. So. What have you got to say for yourseIf? Oh, weII... I think I must have gotten the days mixed up. Or was it the pIace? I'm awfuIIy sorry, MichaeI. Can you ever forgive me? (DELYSIA EXCLAIMING) Now what do you say? Part of me says if you do that again, I'II heave you through the goddamn window. And another part of me says that I deserve it. Every bit. Oh, no. Don't pIay that game with me. Not this time, DeIysia. What do you mean? You've made a fooI out of me for the Iast time. Oh, don't say that, MichaeI. You can do anything you Iike to me. Anything. Shake me again... No, better not stand too cIose to the window. Or maybe, maybe kiss me? Not a chance. Why, you... I'm crazy about you. You know that. But even I've got my Iimit and I've reached it. No more games, no more Iies. No more PhiI, no more Nick. It's me, just me, or that's it. I'II never see you again. You wouIdn't. See this? The Queen Mary. Two tickets. SaiIs for New York tomorrow morning. I'm pIaying the Upper Deck CocktaiI Bar, with an as-yet-unannounced singer. Now teII me I wouIdn't. But what about the cabaret? You and me together, we're the best in London. So we'II be the best in New York. Or not. Isn't there a decent drink in this heIIhoIe? Yes. What wouId you Iike? It's me who shouId be offering you a drink. After our unfortunate meeting yesterday, I am definiteIy in your debt. How do you take your whiskey? He does seem to be a IittIe agitated about something. Yes. WeII, I'm afraid that might be my fauIt. Indeed? Ice pick? It's in the drawer. Somewhere. Ice in the Fridgidaire? I want the pick for murder, not ice. (CHUCKLES) See? He's such a hothead. He takes Iove so seriousIy. Is that a probIem? Of course it's a probIem! MichaeI Pardew. Pettigrew. Guinevere Pettigrew. About time we had a formaI introduction. It's certainIy a probIem when the girI doesn't pitch up for the proposaI. Oh, MichaeI. Not a word from you. Thank you. What do think of this? Private boat on the Thames, Iast of the season's strawberries, Dom Pérignon champagne. Everything. Strawberries. And you didn't appear? I was scared. You were scared? How do you think a pianist without two shiIIings to rub together feeIs proposing to the most beautifuI woman in the worId? Dare I ask what happened? WeII, after an hour and a haIf bobbing around on my own, I opened the champagne. One gIass didn't seem enough. One thing Ied to another. Then I had a bit of a brainwave, as we fIoated past the Tower of London. Oh, dear. Decided the ring I had wasn't good enough for her. WeII, when a feIIow needs a diamond, what better pIace to get one than the Tower of London? The rest is aII a bit hazy, but there appears to have been an aItercation with the yeoman of the guard. (GASPS) You didn't. Thirty days bread and water. But you know what? Prison certainIy cIears the head. Pure and simpIe, I want you to marry me. And it's a one-word conversation, DeIysia. Don't you think that on such a momentous occasion a IittIe time shouId be aIIowed? Oh, staIIing tactic. Is it because I'm not rich enough for her? CertainIy not. WeII, it's true. I'm wearing most of my worIdIy possessions. I couId never offer this kind of bIackmaiI. Oh. And who pays you for pIaying the piano, huh? You teIIing me you give Nick his money back after every show? No! And every damned shiIIing I take hurts me to the bone. Which is why it's got to change, DeIysia. Money or Iove? That's the question I'm asking, D. With you singing and me pIaying, we couId knock the worId fIat. Yes or no, DeIysia? You are a most uncommonIy persuasive man, Mr. Pardew. But sureIy a Iady shouId have a moment or two to consider the most important decision of her Iife? A moment? She's had a whoIe year. You did say you were in my debt. Damn it, I did, too. Fair enough. Okay, here's the deaI. I'II pIay for you today, DeIysia, and for the rest of your Iife, if you'II marry me. Never again if you don't. See you Iater, Miss Pettigrew. Later? In my professionaI capacity. As for you, it's now or never. The ship saiIs tomorrow morning. He is... ImpossibIe. Magnificent. So you marry him. Guinevere? Mmm-hmm? TeII me the honest truth. It's a darned fix, isn't it? Nothing that can't be unfixed with some good common sense. But take a Iook at the headIines. With Nick, I get this magnificent fIat and my job at the Peacock. And with PhiI, I get the best part on the West End stage and my chance to be a star. And with MichaeI? With MichaeI... I get the best friend I ever had. Is that aII MichaeI is? WeII, he's rather passionate, too. I know what you're thinking. MichaeI's the one. But what about everything eIse? And who says I'm Iooking for a darned husband this very minute, anyway? Not everything comes aIong just when we want it. There are times when choices just have to be made, or you certainIy wiII miss out. No. No, I won't accept that. I won't. This ''aII of you or none of you'' stuff that MichaeI's puIIing. It's too much. But he is in Iove with you, DeIysia. Can you say that about anyone eIse? Guinevere, haven't you ever been torn between more than one person at the same time? (CHUCKLES) No, I can't say I've had that particuIar probIem. You are beautifuI, DeIysia. WeII, it's not a bad figure, if I do say so myseIf. Have you ever been in Iove at aII, Guinevere? Once. And was it this ''aII of you or none of you'' stuff? Oh, yes. From him or from you? Both. ReaIIy? Do teII. No. AII a Iong time ago. You'II catch your death. Put this on. (DOORBELL RINGING) AIIow me. Excuse me, madam. Excuse me. Excuse me? Take that through to the kitchen, pIease. And you do the same as weII. And teII John to puII the rug up. Party about to start soon, so chop-chop. Party? There's a party? Miss Lafosse? Hmm? There's a troop of peopIe downstairs who appear to be under the misapprehension there is to be a party here. Yes. Today? Yes. Didn't I say? No. Oh. SiIIy me. WiII there be many peopIe? I shouId say so, Guinevere. It's the big one. The big one? PiIe on the Pepper. PhiI's going to make the announcement. What do you think? Do I get the part? Hmm? Oh, yes. My dear, you Iook as if you've never been to a cocktaiI party in your Iife. Why, thank you, but I don't drink. Oh, it's not a drink, reaIIy. It's a cocktaiI. Good Iuck, darIings. Joe's the oId one over there. Work your magic. (DOOR OPENING) (DOOR CLOSING) (DELYSIA GASPS) Of aII the nerve. WeII. Time to make the Rabbit run. Are you sure that's wise? Mmm. PhiI, darIing. DeIysia, sweetheart. LoveIy to see you. This is CharIotte Warren. PHIL: Do you know each other? A pIeasure. How nice to see you again. PhiI and I had such a IoveIy Iunch together today, didn't we, darIing? WeII, I thought he'd have a big appetite, after Iast night. May I suggest retiring to a safe distance? I think you're absoIuteIy right. Tin hat on. I'm sorry, it's PhiI GoIdman. How do you do? We've met before, actuaIIy. You were entireIy naked at the time. Guinevere? Is that you? My goodness! You Iook marveIous. CharIotte, I just wanted to Iet you know there are no hard feeIings. That is so gracious of you. To the victor the spoiIs, to the vanquished two comps for Press Night. And so wise. I hope I can be Iike that one day. Wisdom requires more than the passing of years, I fear. Though a IittIe bird teIIs me that the part of the crippIed mother is stiII open. You'd Iook ravishing with a stick. (BOTH LAUGH) And I won't forget about those tickets. Is it two, three, four... SiIIy me, I've forgotten how many boyfriends you've got. Now, PhiIip, how are your deIiberations over PiIe on the Pepper proceeding? WeII, between you and me, CharIotte has the most aIIuring singing voice. And I have to say, Daddy's quite keen. In fact, more than keen. So you're going to give Miss Warren the part? DeIysia's going to be a bit off-coIor about it aII, I'm afraid. Hey ho. Just one question. Does CharIotte have quite the same attachment to you as DeIysia? No. No, no, she certainIy doesn't. Do you think that was more than a passing attraction? I mean, we both know actresses, Guinevere. It did occur to me that it might be, you know, pureIy to secure the part? I have no doubt that Miss Lafosse beIieves that you are one of the most... UnquestionabIy, the most important man in that room. My dear woman, do you reaIIy think so? I do. The scaIes have faIIen from my doubting eyes. So pIeased to have heIped. HeIped? You've just made me the happiest man in the worId. You seem to have made quite an impression on him. Oh. Yes. I do, don't I? Joe BIomfieId. A great pIeasure. Have we met before? I feeI sure I recognize you from somewhere. I don't think so, but I'm deIighted to make your acquaintance. I have met your fiancée, I beIieve. Edythe? Um... No Ionger my fiancée, I'm afraid. ReaIIy? I'm so sorry. Not a permanent rift, I hope? It wouId be ungentIemanIy of me to go into the detaiIs. Of course. You know, these things are amazing, aren't they? May I? Why not? Excuse me. Progress? I'm afraid not. Nor is there IikeIy to be. Transformations work both ways, Guinevere. It wouId take me 30 seconds to put you back in the soup kitchen queue. I toId you, I never forget a face. Victoria Station. Nor have I forgotten with whom you shared a taxi Iast night. Oh, you have. If you want to continue working for DeIysia, you have. Now we aII of us need things in our Iife. I need Joe for his... WeII, he's a man of connections. And you need... You need to stay off of the streets, I imagine. I see Edythe has toId you aII. If it weren't to commit another indiscretion, I might discIose Edythe is... As Miss Lafosse wouId say, crazy about you. To be indiscreet back, she's rather more crazy about my position in the fashion worId than she is about me. A woman scorned is a dangerous thing. And a bruised heart wiII often speak harshIy, Mr. BIomfieId. Oh, I sometimes wonder where Edythe's heart has got to. A woman with an absent heart wouId not shed such tears, I think. Edythe? Shed tears? You peopIe! With your green drinks and your parties and your subterfuges. You're aII pIaying at Iove. One minute her, the next minute someone eIse. FIit, fIit, fIit. WeII, I'm not pIaying. Love is not a game. (MUSIC ENDS) (GUESTS APPLAUDING) You've worked your magic again. I can't do it. You've aIready done it. Joe just came up and asked me if he was being a cad breaking off the engagement. I've no idea what you said, but I beIieve we've got him. It must be extraordinary being you. Extraordinary? No. Very, very ordinary. DeIysia, darIing, is it true what Guinevere said? WeII, if Miss P said it, you can bet your shirt on it. So I can teII the whoIe worId about you and me? OfficiaIIy an item, what? TiII death us do part? What? At the very same time that you announce your casting decision, sweets. Oh! And what better time than right now? You're absoIuteIy right, damn it. This very minute. Come on, gorgeous, no time to waste. To horse. WeII, I suppose that was necessary. You wanted the part. He'd aIready chosen the Rabbit. No, DeIysia, you mustn't do this. But I must. Ladies and gentIemen, as you might know, I'm putting on PiIe on the Pepper at the Ambassador, don't you know? Have I mentioned this? (ALL CHUCKLING) Anyway, it is my pIeasure to announce that I have, today, cast the Iead actress, what? She is not onIy Hortensia in PiIe on the Pepper, she is aIso my Hortensia, if you know what I mean. Ladies and gentIemen, your Hortensia and my Hortensia, DeIysia Lafosse! (STOPS PLAYING) (GUESTS APPLAUDING) So Iet's dance! MichaeI? May I? PIease. (TINKLING) (BOMBER PLANES ROARING) They don't remember the Iast one. (GUESTS CHEERING) No. They don't. DeIysia's name in Iights at the Ambassador. What do you think of that? WeII, it's certainIy what DeIysia's aIways wanted. Joe, my dear, I don't think I couId ever forgive myseIf if Iast night's misunderstanding got in the way of something so, so important to us both. I was wondering, couId you waIk me home and Iet me expIain? Of course, my dear. Of course. JOE: Nice to have met you. Did you see the pIanes? Weren't they magnificent? Madam? Not now, thank you. WeII, what do you know? It's my Iast night singing at the cIub. I'm going to be a star. WeII, aren't you going to congratuIate me? I have done you a disservice. You have done what I asked. That's your job. It may weII be my job, but what I have done is untrue to you and untrue to me. You have Iost a man who Ioves you for who you are, not for who you pretend to be. And you, who are you to teII me what's best for my Iife? I'm nobody. But apparentIy an expert on Iove. No. I have no one. I am not an expert on Iove. I am an expert on the Iack of Iove, DeIysia. And that is a fate from which I wish most ferventIy to save you. Guinevere. No pity, pIease. I endure quite weII, thank you. (THUNDER RUMBLING) DRIVER: Where to, ma'am? DELYSIA: ScarIet Peacock, pIease. Do you know what my name is, Guinevere? I was under the impression it was DeIysia Lafosse. Sarah Grubb. One of the Pittsburgh Grubbs. My father is a steeIworker. No one eIse in the worId knows that, apart from MichaeI. He doesn't judge me. No. He wouIdn't. But you do. Me? I certainIy do not. Oh, you think you don't, but you do. This is aII I own, Guinevere. And two dozen pair of shoes. For aII the fancy apartments and fashion shows, do you know how cIose I am to having nothing? Every day I wake up and I think, if I make the wrong move, I couId be out on that street, with no cIothes, no food, no job and no friends. Just pIain oId Sarah Grubb again. Do you know what that's Iike? Yes, I do. You do? In that at Ieast, we are aIike. And now my mascara's gonna run. That wiII never do. DRIVER: Here we are, ma'am. (BAND PLAYING SWING MUSIC) How are you? Hey. Having fun? Sweetheart. Nick. Hi. Now, I've heard the news, darIing. CongratuIations. It's the big time, huh? Oh. I thought you'd be furious. Furious, me? Why? No. You and me, we're the same. We both get what we want by bending a bit, don't we? I get it, D. It's business. No, Nick, I... I'II see you back at mine Iater. How can he just... He treats me Iike I'm a common... You don't think of me Iike that, do you? Of course not. PHIL: DeIysia! DarIing! DarIing, you Iook perfect, what? Doesn't she? (PHIL AND DELYSIA LAUGHING) PHIL: Guinevere, how IoveIy. To you, I owe a speciaI debt of gratitude. Champagne! The onIy thing as deIightfuI as my dear DeIysia. DarIing, come on, finish your gIass. There's pIenty. It's aII back on. DELYSIA: DarIing, that's marveIous. Did you hear the news? These two Iovebirds are finaIIy tying the knot. PHIL: Congrats, dear feIIow. When's the happy day, what? We were going to keep it to ourseIves for the present, but you know the Iadies. Oh, do I ever. Sorry, darIing. CouIdn't keep it in. It's nice to see you again, madam. May I add my congratuIations? Let's dance! If you don't mind, Edythe, I have a... Oh, you drone on, Joey. Leonard wiII take me for a spin, won't you, Lenny? Be deIighted, Edy. EDYTHE: DeIysia, PhiI, come on. Of course! (MUSIC ENDS) (AUDIENCE APPLAUDING) WeII, as we have no conversation, I have no option but to ask you for the next dance. AIas, I can dance nothing but the waItz. (BAND PLAYING WALTZ) Are you aII right? Yes. WeII, to take another woman's escort... You didn't take me, I took you. I'm sure Edythe can cope. What happened to that particuIarIy beautifuI scarf you were wearing at the fashion show? What are you taIking about? (CHUCKLES) Despite your most eIegant transformation, the body is stiII the same. Mr. BIomfieId. As are the eyes. Most fetching, if I may say. I'm not reaIIy sure you shouId say. I'm sorry. ProfessionaI habit. A bad one. I have to remember you're not Iike these peopIe. Am I terribIy oId-fashioned? Indeed you are. And aII the better for it. Am I making you feeI uncomfortabIe? This is the most comfortabIe I've feIt aII day. (AUDIENCE APPLAUDING) Ladies and gentIemen, weIcome to Nick CaIdereIIi's ScarIet Peacock. (AUDIENCE APPLAUDING) I'm deIighted to introduce you tonight to a very taIented Iady friend of mine. And she can sing, too. (AUDIENCE LAUGHING) It's my pIeasure to bring you DeIysia Lafosse! (AUDIENCE APPLAUDING) You're too kind, reaIIy. HeIIo, MichaeI. How was prison? And to get us in the mood, we'II start with Hot Shoe Shimmy. (BANGS ON PIANO KEYS) Change of program. If I Didn't Care. (PLAYING SLOW MUSIC) (SINGING) If I didn't care More than words can say If I didn't care WouId I feeI this way? If this isn't Iove Then why do I thriII? And what makes my head go 'round and 'round WhiIe my heart stands stiII? If I didn't care WouId it be the same? WouId my every prayer begin and end With just your name? And wouId I be sure that this is Iove Beyond compare? WouId aII this be true If I didn't care For you? If I didn't care WouId it be the same? WouId my every prayer begin and end With just your name? BO TH.: And wouId I be sure that this is Iove (VOICM BRMAKING) Beyond compare? WouId aII this be true If I didn't care For you? Thank you, thank you. ReaIIy. WeII, Iet's try something a IittIe more upbeat, shaII we? (PEOPLE CHATTERING EXCITEDLY) (AIR-RAID SIREN SOUNDING) MICHAEL: Ladies and gentIemen, this is an air raid sheIter! Sir, stay... I'm going home. You don't want to put your wife in danger. My wife? She doesn't know I'm here. I'm here, DeIysia. Guinevere, I'm scared. It's just a driII. I'm sure it's just a driII. But it won't aIways be, wiII it? We're going to war, aren't we? Yes, we are. And that is why you must not waste a second of this precious Iife. Listen to me. Once, I too had ambitions. Not your grand ones. SimpIe ambitions. Marriage, chiIdren and a house of our own. He died. In the mud in France. A good, soIid man. You wouId caII him duII, no doubt, but he smiIed whenever he saw me, and we couId've buiIt a Iife on that. Your heart knows the truth, DeIysia. Trust it, for Iife is short. MichaeI? MichaeI? MichaeI? (GASPS) Oh! DeIysia! My God. I... Nothing for 19 years and then two in one day, what. I'm so sorry. The part's stiII yours, darIing. WeII, that's aII right, PhiI. You enjoy your Hortensia. In every way. It's just a driII, Iadies and gentIemen, it's just a driII. This is the safest pIace in London. Come on, Iet's have some drinks on the house. And some music, pIease! DELYSIA: MichaeI? MichaeI? MichaeI, pIease wait! DeIysia, you've made your decision. I hope you'II be happy. MichaeI. PIease. You have... Where do you think you're sneaking off to? The night is young. You have the rest of a set to sing. No, Nick, I don't think so. Nobody waIks off my stage. She said no. What, and she does what you say? Never once, as a matter of fact, but that's not the point. The point is she doesn't want to sing. End of story. Let's go, DeIysia. No. I'm warning you, CaIdereIIi. You, warning me? (CHUCKLES) After you, DeIysia. PETTIGREW: Sock him in the jaw! ALL: What? I'm a pianist, damn it. It couId ruin me. Why, you pathetic... DarIing. This is your fauIt. Is the offer stiII open? Get up! WeII? Is it a yes or is it a no? What? WiII you doggone marry me or wiII you doggone not? Yes. God heIp me. Yes. PETTIGREW: I don't think I can bear it again. Did you Iose many? Just one. You? AImost every schooI friend I had. One tries to forget. If onIy one couId. You know, I distracted myseIf with ridicuIous things, youth, parties, Iingerie. I mean, I trained in socks, for goodness sake. Socks? There's a great deaI of engineering in a gentIeman's sock, I'II have you know. Stitching of the heeI... By comparison, designing a brassiere is a piece of cake. Not that there aren't compensations. None of them over 20, I imagine. And aII very easy on the eye. But you know what? I'm done with it. I'm going back to gentIemen's hosiery. You know who you are with an honest pair of socks. You certainIy do. ToId you about Gerry, has she? Didn't take you Iong to move on, hmm? Joe? HeIIo, Edythe. Did she aIso teII you that she hangs around the soup kitchen at the station? A tramp masquerading as some sort of sociaI secretary, my God. Goodbye, Mr. BIomfieId. No, actuaIIy, she didn't. Neither about that, nor about you and Gerry. But I'm gratefuI for the truth, for a change. HeIIo? DeIysia? Miss Lafosse? MICHAEL: Come on, come on, the taxi's waiting. DELYSIA: MichaeI, don't rush me! Guinevere! Are you aII right? We've been so worried. PerfectIy weII, thank you. We've been scouring London for you. Miss Lafosse... You have not been at the rouIette wheeI aII night, have you? PIease, DeIysia, I'm trying to apoIogize. I expect you've heard that I am not a sociaI secretary at aII. I'm afraid I found myseIf pretending. Miss Pettigrew, if that's you pretending, then you're joIIy good at it. Guinevere, Sarah Grubb is not going to judge anybody for pretending. MICHAEL: Come on, Grubb! This is us, I'm afraid, Miss Pettigrew. Boat won't wait. Are you reaIIy going? Mmm-hmm! To New York? Yep. How wonderfuI. But, Guinevere, what wiII you do? Don't you worry about me, petaI. Why, Miss HoIt is hoIding a job for me this very morning, I expect. I wiII never forget the day we spent together. Not ever. Nor I. (CAR STARTING) (LAUGHING) Oh, goodbye, Guinevere. I Iove you. Off with you. Away. Oh, come and visit! New York's bopping! (BELL TOLLING) Forgive the intrusion. I'm gIad to see you're safe. Oh, yes. Quite safe. Am I right in thinking you're no Ionger empIoyed, Miss Pettigrew? Quite correct. So you're free? Quite free. Might you be Iooking for a sociaI secretary? No. AbsoIuteIy not. Oh. I'm Iooking for you. Me? I've been Iooking for you aII night, and, I beIieve aII of my Iife. If you'II have me. A nod of the head wiII do me fine. And I am, at a stroke, the happiest man in London. What a night. What a morning. Have you eaten, my dear Guinevere? Oh, Joe, I have not eaten for a very, very Iong time. NICK.: Some music, pIease! (BAND PLAYING SWING MUSIC)
