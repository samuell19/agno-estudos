Hey! TOGETHER WE CAN WHAT? Hey! Bayu! Bayu! -Bayu! -Yes, Grandpa. Why didn't you answer before? Open the door! What were you doing? Drum practice, Grandpa. Get ready! Today, we are painting. We're going to the studio. Happy birthday, darling. Blow the candles. You must have thought that I'd forgotten about it. That's impossible. You're my only grandchild. How could I forget? Wear this. And the other side. This kind of clothing is for successful people, Bayu. You have to be a successful person. I'll give you my gift later, okay? It's okay, Mom. I'll pray for you to be employed again soon. There have been some cutbacks in my company. You're the one who needs prayers. To be an intelligent and confident kid who makes me proud. Be a successful kid. That's the most important thing. I'm the only one who knows what's best for you. Come on, hold the cake. Hold this. I've found a good place for your math class. More disciplined. Heri's probably still engaged in other things. He must have forgotten about your birthday. All he cares about is soccer. He's still young, but he's already so obsessed with soccer. I don't like it. Don't forget to drink your milk, Bayu. Why is this picture at the front? Let's go to the studio. -Ouch! -Can you hurry up? You can't stop halfway when urinating. You need to finish it. It's not like watching a VCD where you can pause it and continue later. Where are my car keys? Ouch! Stop pranking people, Heri. It hurts when you run over my foot like that. Not to mention my waist. I have to carry a sack of rice every day. In the name of God. Inah, we're leaving. Donâ€™t forget to close the door! Save my breakfast for tomorrow! -Come on! -Move forward! Take it away! Goal! -Sorry, I'm late. -It's fine, boss. -It's okay, Heri. -It's fine, boss. -There you go. -Thanks. It's fine. Come here. Hey! Thank you, Heri! You were right about Liverpool's win. I got a date yesterday! Goal! So, are we still on? -Are you sure? -Of course. You're sure, right? Okay. Hey, everyone! Come here! Bayu! Bayu, where are you going? -I have an assignment for school. -Assignment? But it's the holidays. It's for a history paper. It has to be submitted on the first day of school. That's why we have to work on it now, sir. The topic is the biography of Indonesia's greatest artists. -Like Raden Saleh. -Ismail Marzuki. Okay, fine. Don't come home too late. Amazing! The Indonesian Teen League Finals. I thought that you had forgotten. No way, Bayu. And there's something else. This is the song that your late father sang, right? When the two of you were playing soccer. Bayu, I want everyone to sing this song for you one day. -Thank you. -Sure. Let's go, Bayu. Bayu. Your twelfth birthday is on the same day as the Indonesian Teen League Finals. Thus, from this day forward, just ignore your grandpa's ban on soccer, okay? Where is he? DKI! -DKI! -Jatim! -DKI! -Jatim! DKI! -East Java! -DKI! Make a goal! A goal! -Sir, don't just sit there. Back away. -I can't. You can't? Just lift your car, then. Heri, I had the same dream again. See? What did I tell you? You're meant to be a soccer player. -Come on, Bayu. -Why don't you come and get it? Bayu, pass me the ball. -Snatch it if you can. -You're hard to catch. Your teamwork was a mess. I told you to never let number ten out of your sight! I'm really disappointed. This time we can-- Hey, who's that? You were the one who kicked the ball, right? Calm down, sir. Don't be angry. Can you kick the ball like that again? Yes, sir. Hey, go on. Please wait, sir. Come on, Bayu. -Go on. -He can do it, sir. Hey, hurry up. -Ouch! -Wow, that was an amazing kick. -Who's that? -Amazing. Which soccer school are you from? Satria Bangsa Soccer School, sir. I'm Johan Lestaluhu, the coach of Arsenal Soccer School. What's your name? -Bayu Purnomo Jati-- -I'm asking him. What's your name? -Bayu Purnomo Jati, sir. -I see. I like your skills. If you're interested to transfer, here's my name card. Thank you, sir. Let me see it. -Arsenal, Bayu! -What was that for? It hurts! That means it's not a dream. Bayu. Ali. Come on. Wow, that's great! Bayu, you seriously don't want it? This is a once in a lifetime kind of offer. Yes, come on. That's crazy. That's amazing! Come on, pass it over to him. Yes! Goal! -Bayu! -I can never win against you. You're playing using sorcery, not skills. You should eat your lunch before it gets cold. Okay. When will your dad return from Holland? You know my dad, Bayu. Whenever he attends law seminars, he'll be gone a long time. Also, you haven't answered my question. You already know that I want it, right? But you also know how my grandpa is. I have a class today. I need to go home now. Bayu! I thought that you don't have a painting class today. I have a music class today. I actually wanted him to play the piano. But he doesn't want to. Yes. Sometimes, parents and kids want different things. But that's music. We can't force it. Let him do what he wants that fits the budget. Money's not an issue. It's not important. I can find more. I don't mind working very hard to get more money. Especially for my grandson's future. PSSI IS HOLDING A SELECTION FOR ITS U-13 NATIONAL TEAM EYEING CHAMPIONSHIP IN CAMBODIA Why don't you ever listen to me? I don't want to see anything related to soccer here! What do you want to become? A soccer player like your late father? And what happened? He was broke and your mother lived a miserable life. He died a taxi driver! If you talk about soccer again, you're no longer my grandson. A soccer player doesn't have any quality or class. All they do is kick a ball around. They do get paid well nowadays. But what happens if they get injured? Especially soccer in Indonesia. Even the spectators die. Absolutely awful! Okay, kids. Today, we are going to learn about operations with decimals. Decimal is a form of number where... Are you sure that the pirated version of the new game is already out? Not just the cover? Yes, I already played it. And I have prepared an example. Here is how you calculate it. Eight point six plus five point seven. Look, it'll be easier... What do you want to do? You said that you wanted to see him, but now you've lost your courage. I told you, it's better to talk at his house. Shut up. Come on. Plus five point seven... Your classes will be useful even after you've grown up. So don't be lazy. Don't even think about it, got it? Yes, Grandpa. PSSI IS HOLDING A SELECTION FOR ITS U-13 NATIONAL TEAM EYEING CHAMPIONSHIP IN CAMBODIA It's time for you to join a soccer school. So that you can go for the selection. And now, we also have Mr. Johan. He's convinced that you're talented. What more do you want? I can't leave my classes. My grandpa... It's impossible. I've promised you. I've made a promise that we'd face this together. Don't you get it? Besides, you always tell me that your grandpa only cares about success. If you joined the national team, I'm sure he'll be pleased. Listen to me, Bayu. You think that an offer like this will ever come again? Don't be so sure. Your grandpa only needs to know once you've joined the national team. Trust me. Boo! -You're home already? -Yes. -Let me help you, Mom. -Have you eaten yet? -Let's eat. -Yes. Bayu! But I also... Miss, we're here to see Mr. Johan. -What's your name, kid? -Bayu, miss. Wow, I'm entering the enemy's lair. Liverpool to Arsenal. What did you tell your grandpa, Bayu? I told him that I needed to find a good book for my English class. Just go straight to the field, kid. Thank you, miss. Let's go, Bayu. Come on, hurry up! Heri! Don't worry. I'll figure it out. It's so expensive, Heri. It's your turn to guard. It's a good ball. What's the matter? You've never seen an expensive ball before? Good day, Mr. Johan. We've come to accept your invitation. You lied. I've checked with the Satria Bangsa Soccer School. And your name wasn't there. I was the one who lied, sir. And he let you, didn't he? But you've seen his talent. I'm sure that you can help him enter the national team. It's no use to have talent if you're a liar. -Sir! Mr. Johan! -Mr. Johan! What else do you want? -I want to become a soccer player, sir. -Is that all? I want to pass the U-13 national team selection. To wear the Garuda symbol here. You can worry about that later. -Have you seen the brochure? -Yes, sir. I'm sure that this soccer school has a scholarship program. Especially for players like Bayu, sir. The selection process is very tough. But you've seen his talent. The selection is in two weeks. Be well-prepared and practice hard. Talent isn't enough here. I'll return in two weeks from now, sir. Are you serious? That's a badminton court, not a soccer field. What are you going to practice there? Smashing or dribbling? No need to talk about fields with such anger. Let me find you the best field for you to practice on. I'm an expert on fields. Except working fields, they're hard to come by. The further the better. So my grandpa can't get a sniff. So your grandpa is a descendant of a dog, is it? Hey, don't laugh at an elderly. It's sinful. Let's go. -Where's the English book? -None of them were good enough. I should've asked you to come along. Because you know what's good for me. That's correct. I know what's good for you. By the way, when we were on our way there, Heri's car ran over a nail and had a flat tire. So we had to go to the garage. I don't need to hear any of your excuses. Your holiday ends in two days. So you have to tighten your schedule. Stop playing around. Bayu, your classes-- Did you sell a lot today? Have you eaten, Dad? It's locked, Mr. Dulloh! Why is it locked? When I passed by last week, there were many kids playing soccer here. If this goes on, how can soccer make any progress? You need to practice gymnastics. Go to the gym, Bayu. I want to be like Bambang Pamungkas, not Ade Rai. No one's better than Ali Daei from Iran. He could pass anyone when dribbling a ball. Not only the players, he could even pass the spectators. Bayu, get back to work! Do you know that Arsene Wenger transformed the English League through practices like this. Stop talking about practice. Tomorrow is the first day of school. Where can we go practice? Damn. -Help me get it, please. -I'm washing the car. The car is already clean. Just go and get the ball. Why do I have to deal with this? What if I get mobbed by the people? Bayu, get down. -Let him be. -Don't be too brave. If anything happens to you, I'll be held responsible. Get down! -Come on, Mr. Dulloh! -No way! Nobody plays soccer up there! Bayu! Are you going to pretend to be an airplane up there? Get down! It's dangerous up here. Let's go. What's wrong? They are gang members. Let's go somewhere else. NUSANTARA ELEMENTARY SCHOOL Bayu, don't forget that you have your music class later. We've been looking for you. Hey! Thank you. Hey, what will happen to Arsenal? This year, the winner will be Chelsea. Don't be so sure, sir. The season's just begun. Besides, Arsenal had only lost twice. That's just an excuse. Losing is losing, Heri. You know that the best team is Barcelona, right? Enough! Get me one more portion. -Are you not ordering? -I won't be able to pass Mr. Johan's test. How can I practice well without a field? We can still find a field. But you need to reduce your classes to focus more on soccer. Right? -Yes. -You guys can only talk. Go talk to my grandpa. -What about our social project? -Cleaning trash? -Where? -How about your house? You all are so loud. What are you kids talking about? We're told to do a social project outside of the school. We're discussing the project. -I see. -Sir, give me one more portion. -Okay, boss. -Me too, sir. -And me! -Sure! -Here, boss Yobel. -Me too, sir. We can do any social work for the project. Heri will be helping me. So, I'll be spending more time with him. -What's your project? -There are many choices. I'll tell you later. But what about my classes? You still need to attend your classes. Just learn to manage your time better and stay focus. Just like that. Be more focused, okay? The point is, you have to move effectively. Don't waste your stamina. Arthur, show them how it's done. Wow, that kid's quite good. Amazing. What are you doing? Damn. How can I pass? I've never practiced with plastics like that. Relax. Technique is my expertise. Just make sure that Mr. Johan allows you to take the test. That's all. But I need more practice. But how? I haven't even found a field yet. Nowadays, it's so hard to find a soccer field in Jakarta. They've all been turned into buildings. -Stop, Mr. Dulloh! -Oh, my God! What is it? What's wrong? This is so creepy, Bayu! Bayu! Hey, Bayu! -It's so hard to find a field. -This place is creepy, Bayu! -This is what I'm looking for! -Bayu, let's go home! This is perfect. How so? This is a cemetery, not a field. Let's go home! Hey, Bayu! This place is creepy! Dracula's children live here! Excuse us, dead people. We don't mean to disturb. We're here to play soccer. If you want to watch, please be civilized, don't fight. Let's go home, Bayu! This place is creepy! -This place feels weird. I don't like it. -Let's go, Mr. Dulloh. Ghost! -Oh, my God! -Dracula's child! Let's go home! Let's go! You should listen to the elders. Don't play soccer at a cemetery. You might get possessed. She's also here. Hey! What are you doing here? You see, I want to practice soccer here. -Practice soccer? -Yes. Because this is the best place. I want to join the Indonesian national team. My father is sick. He can no longer clean the cemetery. So I don't want the place to get dirty. Don't worry about that. By the way, what's your name? -Zahra. -I'm Heri. This is our soccer champ, Bayu. And that one over there is Mr. Dulloh. So, there will be three guys helping you. Relax. -As long as I can practice. -How about that? The field for soccer practice will be paid with helping hands. Okay? I want this cemetery to be cleaned twice a week. Yes! I know what our social project is going to be. Leaves will be our main problem. Heri, Bayu. Where are you boys going? Don't just rely on assumptions. Why don't we meet first? Yes, how about tomorrow at 3:47 p.m.? Okay? I'll explain more tomorrow. This one's different. Okay, see you tomorrow. -Boo! -You! What are you doing? -You look tired. I'll give you a massage. -Yes. It's been a while since you last did this. You give the best massages. It's worth the breech birth. Hey, breech babies give the best massages when they grow up. You don't believe it? Come here. I'll give you one. I was a breech baby, too. He enjoyed it so much that he fell asleep. That's not fair. You're not being fair. Hey, 111 multiplied by 111. What's the answer? 12,321, Grandpa. My grandson is so smart. About the social project, -I already know what I'm going to do. -What? I'm going to help take care of the cemetery at the end of our complex. That abandoned cemetery? Yes. Apparently, the guard is ill. -Really? -He needs help. So, I'll be going there often. Your project sounds great. Smart boy. THE 1945 WARRIORS Don't go there too often. Mr. Sitanggang is a bit grumpy. If you need to practice with goal posts, you can use Mrs. Astuti's and Mr. Imam's graves. They're near my house. I've asked for their permission and they're fine with it. Mrs. Astuti is very kind. She used to be a teacher. While Mr. Imam simply likes soccer. He was a fan of Perseba... -Persebaya Surabaya? -Yes, that's the one. That's where he came from. She's crazy. She watches too much horror movies. You can go around anywhere, except for my house. And remember, never address my dad. Besides, who would want to talk to Dracula, right? Hey, you should stay away from there. Mrs. Nunung doesn't like noisy boys. NUNUNG PLAWIRA ATMAJA Wait for me, Bayu! Come on. To the left! Yes, keep going. Try to dribble the ball like that kid over there. What are these? Gosh, Bayu. Listen to me. These three circles are the strikers. Then, his teammate will score the goal. Understand? Let's go! Let's go! Keep going! Bayu! Please don't give me more problems, Bayu. We're in a difficult situation right now. Nowadays, it's hard to find a downline. People no longer trust MLM like they used to. You can't handle attending one of the best schools here anymore? I can't transfer you to another school. We don't have the money. Make sure that you'll never get a low score like this again. The current scholarship selection process is using a team system. You'll be divided into two teams, the yellow and blue team. The two teams will compete. We'll announce the result today. -Got it? -Okay! Run, Bayu! Come on! Goal! Come on, Bayu! Bayu! Chase the ball! I have no stamina. Calm down. Let me solve this problem. Bayu. Yes! Don't worry about stamina, Bayu. Arsene Wenger transformed the English League with bananas. -You need to eat a lot of bananas. -What? Eat lots of bananas? Don't underestimate this. You know what? One banana contains lots of potassium. It'll give us enough energy to last for two times 45 minutes. I don't care if it's potassium or a pot for plants. The fact is, when someone eats too much bananas, they'll turn into a monkey. Do you want to jump around on the field? So you're attending this soccer school with a scholarship? -We don't have to pay? -Please don't tell Grandpa, Mom. You can tell him after I have joined the national team. The national team? I joined the soccer school to participate in the national team selection. I want to wear this. But you have to promise you'll tell Grandpa. -I promise, Mom. -But please, no more low marks. I solemnly promise. As long as you promise about Grandpa. Okay. Goal! Yes! I want to talk to you about Bayu, Dad. About what? He's a sixth grader now. His lessons are getting harder. He's also getting more homework. -I think his classes-- -His classes are important, Yuni. We can't let him stop going to those classes. A formal education is not enough. -Especially in Indonesia. -You're right, Dad. I understand. I don't want him to stop going to all of them. But perhaps we can be more selective. Keep the ones that match Bayu's talents. Maybe we should choose between his music or painting class. -So the cost won't be-- -You don't need to worry about money. I have enough to support my grandson's future. But you're right about being selective. We can stop one of them. However, I need to make sure where exactly his talent lies. Everything starts from lines. From lines-- Please be seated. From lines, it becomes a picture. So, be genuine when you draw your first line. Don't hesitate. Imagine, for example, a flower. Draw a line to form a flower. You're already tired after just one practice session. You should just play Monopoly with your friend. Don't listen to him. It'll only inflate his ego. -Four. -Five. -Six. -Seven. Eight, nine, ten. Change. -One. -Two. -Three. -Four. -Five. -Six. -Seven. -Eight. -Nine. -Ten. Change again. -One. -Two. -Three. -Four. -Five. -Six. -Seven. -Eight. -Nine. -Ten. Gather around. The U-13 PSSI selection has already reached Jogjakarta and Surabaya. Soon, they'll arrive here. -Are you guys ready? -Ready! To make us all proud, you'll have to practice three times harder than this. -Your rivals are from all over Indonesia. -Okay. -Louder! Okay? -Okay! Let's go. -SSI! -Arsenal! -SSI! -Arsenal! -SSI! -Arsenal! Yes, let's go! Go practice. Hey! Catch up! You're too slow! -Straight to the front. -Three, four... -Let's go. -There's a medicine store. Oh, my God. Just follow me. -I need to go over there. -It's over there. That vitamin, sir. Yes. This one. And that. Please give me one. -One pack? -Yes. Bayu! High fiber foods are good for you. To improve your digestion! -Ouch, that hurts! -Bayu, don't forget. Let it all out. Don't leave anything inside. Arthur, you should go play in the kitchen. You look like someone who should stay in the kitchen. -Why don't you go play in the kitchen? -That's enough, Arthur. -Stop it, Arthur. -Stop messing around! Concentrate! Look! Practice! Concentrate! Come on! Practice! You only laugh because you don't know the properties of this rock. As far as I know, rocks are usually used to pelt mangoes. -Here, try wearing this. -No way! You'll have a clearer mind. You can think of better soccer strategies. If you want to become a great drummer, you need to practice seriously. Be disciplined! Come on. Why are you not sleeping yet? You'll be late for school tomorrow. It's getting worse. Now my grandpa's more insistent on figuring out my talent. And which one do you prefer? It's like you barely know me. Why do you need to ask me about that? Neither, of course. Oh, my God, Bayu. I mean, which one do you like better? What is Zahra doing? I think that she likes to paint. She insisted that I leave my tools here. But, isn't that your painting? What if she ruins it? What the hell are you doing? Oh, no! I'm doing it for you because you never finished your painting. I thought that if I added something it can-- Can what? You've ruined everything! Where have you been? It's late. I was from the cemetery project, Grandpa. What's that you're carrying? Is this your painting? Why didn't you show me earlier? This is great, Bayu. You have the talent to become an artist. Classy. Why didn't you make a painting like this before? Look at this. Starting from tomorrow, you can quit your music class. Just focus on painting. A souvenir is a must, Dad. But please come home soon. Or I'll end up becoming Mr. Dulloh's son. I can learn, Dad. I mean, you can't go to the Netherlands just because you like cheese. -Here's your breakfast. -Thank you. Hello? What's up, Bayu? Calm down, Bayu. Relax. What is it? Talk to me. Hurry up! Ouch! -No. -Hurry up. What are you guys doing in here? Didn't I forbid you to come in here? Is the field cleaned? It's about yesterday's painting. I brought it home. And my grandpa really loved it. He said that it looks like the work of a great artist. And he's right. The artist is great. So? So, I claimed it as mine. Sorry, Ra. I needed to make my grandpa stop one of my classes. Now that he believes that I can paint, he has stopped my music classes. Please, Zahra. Paint for me. Why don't you bring him to the hospital? My dad is afraid of going out. Why? He took me away from Samarinda, from my mom's family. He decided to work here so that he'll only have to deal with death. I also quit school because he's worried that my mom's family will take me away. Do you want to go back to school? I want to learn how to paint. They are all here. Hey! This is good for you, Bayu! Good for you, not for me. -Bayu! -Bayu, drink that! -No way! Fish oil tastes disgusting! -It's tasty! Bayu, drink this! Hey! Ouch! -Sorry, Mrs. Nunung. -Hey, don't do that! Bayu! -I'm not drinking that fish oil! -You have to! -No way. Never. -Bayu, drink this! -Bayu's being bad. Pull his ear, ma'am. -I told you not to do that. Are you all right, Heri? He usually doesn't want any help. -Even from his best friend. -That's just an excuse. -But it's true. -Thank you. How cute. -How cute. -Bayu, damn you! Bayu! Hey, Bayu! I need your help. Zahra? His new friend that lives in a cemetery. -Cemetery? -Yes. What's wrong? -Do you want to reserve one? -You go and reserve one. JUNIOR CLASS, MIDDLE CLASS, GENERAL CLASS Be patient. The selection is soon, right? If you pass, you can wear the national team's uniform. I'm sure your grandpa will see reason. And your grandpa is very pleased with you now. You're right. The most important thing is that Grandpa is pleased with me right now. What's this? You just don't know that this rock can cool down your head. You used to say that she's crazy. Zahra is not crazy. She's... Zahra is unique. Hey! -Unique or pretty? -Don't talk nonsense! -Heri likes Zahra! -Watch it, Bayu! -Heri likes Zahra! -Bayu! -Heri likes Zahra! -Bayu! -Bayu! -Heri likes Zahra! Heri likes Zahra! -Heri likes Zahra! -That's a lie! -Don't! -Heri likes Zahra! -Don't believe that! -Heri likes Zahra! -Heri likes Zahra! -That's a lie. Bayu! Are you sure that you want to withdraw your pension fund? Are you going to start a business? Business for the future. Eat your breakfast. I have some good news. Next month, I'll receive a motorcycle as a bonus. I also have some good news. Bayu just got accepted into Mr. Putu's studio. He's a world-class artist. Isn't that an expensive studio, Dad? Putu Media studio, right? Come on. You're the one who said that Bayu needed to focus. So I found him the best studio. Don't worry about money. I'm a Pertamina's pensioner. Yes, Dad. But isn't it too early for Bayu? His painting skills-- I forgot that I haven't shown you his painting. Here. Look! Amazing, right? This is incredible! I'm going to go to Putu Media studio to take care of the registration process. Bayu, you need to go to school by yourself today. Okay? I'll see you at home. Then, we'll head over to this amazing studio together. Bayu. Whose painting is that? Don't lie! My friend made it, Mom. It's a long story. That's out of line! Look at me! Please don't tell Grandpa now. The results of the selection will be announced soon. I won't be able to handle many classes. Please, Mom. This is a contemporary piece, sir. -Is this yours? -No, it's my grandson's. -Grandson? -Yes. I have an extra practice session from noon until afternoon. Just ask for a day-off. Say that your grandpa is sick. Bayu. Bayu. Bayu. Bayu? NUSANTARA ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SOCIAL PROJECT Where are you taking my daughter's painting? These guys are from the U-13 selection team of PSSI. They have been watching you for the past few days. And today, they'll announce the three kids from this soccer school who will participate in the U-13 selection three weeks from now at Senayan. Go ahead, sir. The first one is Benny Sudarmaji. Sorry, sir. The parking lot is over there. The second one is Arthur Wilson. Are you all right, sir? Sir? is Bayu Purnomo Jati. I know that my lessons won't go to waste. High five! Bayu, yes! Grandpa! Grandpa! Grandpa! Grandpa, wake up! Grandpa! Don't leave me, Grandpa! -Bayu! -Grandpa! -Bayu! -Mom! -It's Grandpa, Mom! -Bayu. -It's all my fault. -It's okay, Bayu. Calm down. Grandpa! It's not right to run away from your problems. That will only create more problems. Hold on. The rocks are too big. Again, sir. -Why did you break the glass? -I didn't do it on purpose. Sorry, but Bayu isn't accepting any visitors. Okay. Don't persist, Heri. Let's go home. We'll try again tomorrow. Hopefully, he'll change his mind tomorrow. -Okay. We'll head back, ma'am. -Yes. -Hopefully Mr. Usman will get well soon. -Thank you. -Peace be upon you. -Peace be upon you, too. What is it, Bayu? Can you take me to the hospital tomorrow, Mom? I want to be with Grandpa until he wakes up. Yes, sure. Bayu! Bayu! Go ahead, you can start practicing. -Let's go. -Go. Take that one. Mr. Johan, I need to talk to you about something. About the U-13 selection the other day, I believe there was something wrong. My son, Darma, should've passed to participate in the selection. But he's 14 years old. This is for 13-year-old kids. That can be arranged, sir. I know many people who can help. If my son can join the national team, Indonesia will be able to talk on a bigger stage. Talk about what? Lies? Who's the "we" that you're talking about? Don't bring up Indonesia in this. Mr. Johan, if one of the kids from this school can join the national team and become a star, who will profit from it? Who? It's you! So don't be a hypocrite-- Hey! When I left my village, Tulehu, and the soccer school there, everyone was cheering me on. Because there are soccer villages there. Everyone was hoping that I would become a great soccer coach. And now, you're telling me to profit from it? So, you'd rather choose that boy, Bayu, over my son, Darma? Right? You're too naive. We'll see what happens. A package? Oh, my God. Can't you hear that the phone's ringing? Hello? Yes, sir. I'm thankfully healthy. You're not coming home yet? I guess you really like it there. Yes, we just received it. Wait a moment, sir. Heri, your dad wants to speak to you. Sir, Heri is currently unavailable. He's too eager to try on his new shoes, shirt, and pants. Yes, sure. I'll tell him that. Okay. That soccer shirt is so shiny. Even an owl will be dazzled by it. Who are these shoes for? It was meant for Bayu. But now, they're useless. They're useless for me, too. They won't fit. I almost forgot. I wanted to ask you. Just because you stop playing soccer together, you have to stop being friends, too? That's too bad. Wahyuni. Dad. Dad, I'm sorry. I'm also guilty. I just wanted to give the best for Bayu. Tell me. Enlighten me. What is it that I've never known about my grandson all this time? Everything, Yuni. Also about you. Okay, Dad. Bayu. What are you doing here? I've wanted to apologize for a while now, but you kept ignoring me. Sorry that I'm only apologizing now. Wait. I have soccer shoes for you. You still dare to talk about soccer with me? Can't you see the condition that my grandpa is in? Are you just going to pretend to forget that? These are gifts from my dad. I shouldn't have listened to you. I should have listened to my grandpa. Following his advice, not yours. Bayu, I was born like this. I can't have a dream to join the national team like you. But I was so happy just watching you. I want our national team to be the best and my friend to be one of its players. Bayu! Bayu! I was wrong. Now, may I apologize to your grandpa? So that we can be friends again. There's no need. You should go home. You should find a new friend who can make you proud. Bayu. Come here. Your mom has told me everything. She's brought all of these here. I'm sorry, Grandpa. From now on, I'll listen to everything that you tell me to do. I won't lie anymore. I'll do anything to make you happy. And stay healthy. I also want to apologize to you. You know why I don't like soccer, right? Because of your dad. I didn't approve of him being a soccer player. But the more I forbade him, the more determined he became. He even left home. With only his talent as an asset. He said that he wanted to participate in the national team selection. But then, he got badly injured. So, when he wanted to teach you to become a soccer player, I was furious. That's how he was. Stubborn. Until the day he died, I hadn't talked to him again. But at least, I'm right. You do have a talent as an artist. But as a soccer artist. The way that you were dribbling the ball made my heart stop beating. Amazing! Bayu, chase your dream. Why do you look so sad? The selection is in two days, Grandpa. It's impossible. It's up to you. I won't force you anymore. Come on. You even had the guts to lie to me, but you're giving up on a selection that's still two days away? That's Mr. Johan. Sir, that's Mr. Johan. Hey, step aside. We're in a hurry! -Hurry up! -Bayu! -Hey, Bayu! -Mr. Johan! Mr. Johan, stop! Selfish jerk! What do you want now? Any more tricks up your sleeve? My grandpa has always told me that soccer is useless. -Especially in Indonesia. -What's your point? -Why are you here now? -I want to show him that's not true. I want to prove that I can make him proud by playing soccer. I want to pass the national team selection. But you have to work harder. You don't have much time left and you have to catch up. Understand? Thank God. How does it feel to be back in school? Do you miss it? The school itself is ordinary. The best thing about my current school is that it has a painting class. How cute. Stop it. Hey, look. -Wow, that's so cool. -Painting is her talent. And yours is playing soccer. Don't forget to eat these. Sarimin is going to the market. Sarimin is playing soccer. -That's him! -That's Bayu! -Come on, Bayu! -Come on, Bayu! Grandpa, this is Heri's dad. And this is Zahra's dad. This is Bayu's grandpa. Ifa Ridho. Hey! Agustya Lubis. Hooray! I'm joining the national team. Reza Saptoro. Arthur Wilson. Come on, Bayu! Come on, Bayu! Goal! Fred William. Benny. Come on, Bayu! Subtitle translation by Shelomi Angeli Karmo R
