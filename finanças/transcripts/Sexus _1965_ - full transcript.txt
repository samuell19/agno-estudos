What time is he supposed to call? He shouldn't be long. "Inside her, remains only the desire to play for Pierre." You think he's gonna pay up? I don't know, buddy. I really don't know. The girl's not easy going. Give me a beer. What time is it? 9 o'clock. - I'm opening the window. - Are you nuts!? We're dying! Who's the girl? I'll be here before 4. If I'm not, get rid of the girl and beat it. She made a right mess of your face! 1. 2. 3. Asshole! Give me a beer. - Nothing new? - Nothing. Don't bother! There's nobody for miles around anyway. Do you know you're handsome? Is it gonna take long? Until your father pays up. I'm hungry, you know. Come. I'm thirsty! - Do you want to eat something? - Yes. Make her a sandwich. There's something wrong. I think her father called the police. Take it easy, guys! It's me, Fran?ois. Well done, Karl. The deadline is still 4 o'clock. If the ransom isn't paid... Every sort of weapon, we can kill at any range. I couldn't have put it better myself! It's midnight, the witching hour. Like in the novels. What the fuck is he doing?! I'm telling you he's gonna con us! Why? Why? Karl... Don't do that! Don't do that! I don't want to kill you! She's running away! Do you see her? It's funny, it's just like home. My father never said a thing. We were always silent. From time to time, he would put on some Bach. Or some Haydn. What's your name, by the way? Virginie. I can't believe it. The boss isn't gonna let us down. The boss is a bastard. Get up! Get up, bitch! Get up! I'm sick of this! We'll do it my way ! It's not my fault. It's really not my fault. It's Jean. The rendez-vous is at 4 by the Ch?ne wood. With the package. Goodbye. Have fun! You know... they were my friends. My only friends. What are you gonna do? Go to your room. What are you gonna do? To your room. I'm looking at a little girl half foolhardy, half scared to death. With a floating smile. You're a bit mad, Virginie. You're creating tragedies. You structure them. And then you look at me with a kind of drowned look. To your room. I hate you, you know. The deal is off. Everything went wrong. Ice the girl and beat it. So many killings... So many killings... Sit down. Do you know what's happening at the castle? You can tell me later. Don't you think it looks like Scarlet's room? What's gonna happen, Pierre ? To you, to me? It's very simple. Actually, it's not simple at all. I'll take you home. Pierre... You, me... It's not possible? I already told you, you're a bit crazy. And you, Pierre, what's gonna happen to you? Your friends... You were supposed to kill me. I'm gonna tell you one more crazy thing. I desire you. Mr. Duclos said: "My grandfather was a radical, my father a socialist, I'm a communist; our family never changed. In this old country of civil wars, antagonisms outlast the memories of their causes. It's often said that the French never reconciled after the fall of the monarchy and the execution of Louis XVI. But at what point in their history weren't they in quarrel? Louis XIV..." Kiss me, Pierre. - So? - Pierre killed Karl and my Fran?ois. All right, we'll take care of that. Leave me alone! Maybe because I'm a little crazy too, I'm gonna tell you something, Virginie. You know it's a bit absurd, Virginie. By not killing me, you condemned yourself to death. We must do something! There's nothing to do, Virginie. They'll find me anyway. But, Pierre, you can't just accept this! What time is it? 3 o'clock. Tell me about yourself. Who are you? Tell me about the objects around you. Tell me what you do, the way you live. Don't you think it's pathetic, excessive, the things happening to us?... Every movement I make, every kiss I give you seems to be building for an eternity. I can't admit that in one hour... - Don't answer, Pierre ! - Give me the phone. I guess you didn't get rid of the package. - No. - Okay. Deliver it at 4 as planned. It's funny... In the movies... heroes, every time they make love, feel the need to say definitive things. I too feel the need to say one definitive thing. A sentence I have had in my head for a while. Man challenges himself for his own purpose. He still sees in life a dangerous game, that he pleases to change the rules, for an instant. In doing so, he surpasses himself and fathers, with his own destruction, an intimate and brief eminence. Get up, Virginie. And you, who are you, Pierre? Translation and timing: Aquasantajoe Proofreading : Cosnculp For Cinemageddon, May 2011
