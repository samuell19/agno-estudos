PAT: Sonia, why put up with it at all? - Yeah, but what can I do? - What do you mean? Him is the only man about the place? Yeah, but... Honestly, Sonia, there's no point. The amount of times you go out of your way to give him money - buy him this, buy him that - and in the end, what do you get? It's true, cos I'm really fed up of everything. You always say that. You never do anything about it. Dat's why me no bother fe talk to her because she no listen. From the first time you tell me him mess wit' one of your friends, and when you ask him about it, him wanna lick you? You should have left him. You have to take some of the blame. He couldn't gwan with dem slackness if you never did make him. Look, Sonia... You can't afford to have any man mess you about when you're trying to get what you want out of life. All that kind of rubbish just holds you back. Yeah, it's right, I should leave him. The only time I see him is when he wants something. I'm the one that gets all the worries and depression, not him. What are you going to do? CHAMBERLAIN: All right, then, Pat? Cynthia, she looking as happy as ever. Sonia, come now, I wan' talk to you. PAT: You want nothing to do with him.

You know what I mean. The answer is, no, I'm not ready for it yet, man. Why not? Everything is cool as it is. Why you wanna change things? You didn't hear what the man say? You shouldn't change a winning game. It's not a game, Del. All my friends think we should. And if you really think a lot of me, you should want to. It's not that, but everything is cool, man. We can't go on like this for ever. All right, Pat, but in good time. When? Let me sleep, man. You carry on this thinking. Well, let's break, then. Go on, take your clothes and leave. There's no point in me being with you if you don't take our future seriously. - I said I'll think about it, didn't I? - No! We've been together for long enough. You shouldn't have to think about it. Either you do or you don't. We talk about it in five or six months' time. You really mean that, Del? I said so, didn't I? Del? Del! You all right? Yeah, man, me all right. I'm just resting up the body, you know. So when did you get home, then? I see you, or somebody cooked. It's not a woman cook it. it's me cook it. I thought I'd surprise you, that's all.

How are we going to do that? We just can't. it's not the end of the world, it's only material things. Yeah, but I just like material things. Anyway, you can't talk.

I've tried to talk to him, right, but he just dismiss everything I say. Cynthia, he thinks I'm too possessive. They always say that, Pat. But if you don't show them say you care, them no like it. No, me sure as if it was you going out and coming in late, Del would not like that. Look, I've told him that, but he just doesn't take any notice. It's up to you. You'll have to give him a taste of his own medicine. Talk to him again, see how it go. If things don't change, Pat, you have to put your foot down. Otherwise...done with him. That's what me think, anyway. (Del sings) Going out? Wha' it look like? - You no want the food? - I'll deal with it when I come in later. You see Sonia and Chamberlain lately?

It's goin' be like the old times tonight. Remember we used to be the last one to dress all the time. God! - Where's Cynthia? - She's downstairs waiting in the car. - Come on. Aren't you ready yet? - All right, all right. That looks nice. - You think so? - It's all right. - What about my hair? - Wha' you dress up for? Come on, man. Hang on. Powder... Better take the lot in case I sweat. - Come on, Pat. - Hang on, Sonia. Don't rush me. Right. - How's Tony? - He's all right, you know. Still the same - bit dull. Oh, come on, Cynthia. Always moaning at him. I'm all right, man, but sometime I want some excitement. Careful. You'll have enough excitement. - You have a baby coming. - Mm-hm. - You have a nice house. - Mm-hm. Need some furniture, though. What more do you want? So what you been doing otherwise, Pat? No, nothing, really. Cynthia was lucky She had everything I wanted. My life seemed empty All I was doing was changing at my flat, buying clothes and seeing friends. As usual, Cynthia had something to say about my life. She said I should get involved with something. You know, come to her political meetings. But I wanted other things out of life. (Phone rings) Hello. Who is it? Oh, Del, hello. How are you? I'm fine, thank you. Yes. No, that was last week. Yeah, that's right. Del! (Mouths) No, I'm sorry. She left this firm about three weeks ago. Yeah, that's right. OK. I will. Yeah. Bye. - Thanks, Chris. - What was all that about? - Nothing. - You can tell me, you know. OK. Hey, wha' happen? It's a long time, innit? I just want to talk to you for a minute. Pat, I just wan' talk to you for a minute. - Why are you following me? - I wan' reason with you, that's all. (Kisses teeth) I've thought about it a lot. And I realise that most of it was my fault. It's true. I did take you for granted. I'm wiser now. I feel say it can work out this time. I know I shouldn't have involve myself with my friends all the time. And you're more important than friends. I didn't check out what was happening. I just figured you was jealous and possessive. First, when I lose my job, first it hurt me. After a while I was glad, cos I could do anything - do what I want, when I want. I was free. Yeah, but you weren't working. That started most of our problems. Are you working now? To tell you the truth, on and off. Look, I don't wan' make no excuses, but it's kind of hard to find work as a toolmaker nowadays. I'm doing some temporary agency work. It's kinda hard to stick them slavery jobs down. I'll hold it till I get a decent job. - Where are you staying? - I'm staying at my parents' house. I've been looking for a flat, but it's hard to find a flat. If you think finding work is hard... Yeah. It's torture with the old man. I only eat and sleep there. Would you like anything else to drink? Could I have some wine, please? Wine? - Just pineapple juice. - OK. So, Pat, wha' you say about me and you? Del, I don't know. I'll have to think about it. What would you have done if I'd said I wasn't interested? - Try again, innit. - If I still said no? Give up. (Laughs) You laugh and then what? Wha' you think? Find myself another woman. I saw you with one after we broke up. What woman? Don't play innocent with me, Del. I never touched any woman from the time I started going out with you until now.

What's it got to do with you? - L-I'm just a friend. - What sort of friend? - His girlfriend. - Girlfriend, eh? Well, your boyfriend's in bad trouble. Scott's already been charged, but Bennett's got to wait. Can I see him? Not until we get a medical report on that police officer your boyfriend tried to carve up. - Shall I stay? - Suit yourself. Can't you tell me what's happening? Look, miss, we don't even know what's happening ourselves. It might even be Monday before we know how bad that lad of yours is in trouble. So why don't you just go home? Or you can wait here. Suit yourself. Want to come to a party, sweetheart? Talking to you, love. Here! Here, love. (Speeds off) So, wha' happen after that? I went to the police station. When I got there they said he was in there with Scotty. How long they goin' keep him there? Did babylon say if they charge him yet? They said they haven't charged him yet. It would be serious cos one of the police is in hospital. More than serious. Wha' happen to the other breda? They said he was charged with assault. All right. I'll go and get a lawyer to go down to the police station with me. Del name Bennett, innit? And Scotty? Newham Scott. All right. I will see you later, yeah? - All right.

By the time you hear this tune you goin' wan' know me. (Horn toots) Been waiting a long time? Del got four years. I couldn't believe it My whole life was falling down round me. I was really grateful to Cynthia, though, cos without her I don't know what I would have done. Going to prison was another bad experience. Imagine me going to a prison. If my father had found out, he would have disowned me. I just wanted to hide away Hi. The barrister think you'll only get two years. For what? So they can take 'way my freedom cos I defended myself? What was I supposed to do? Let them beat me? Am I a dog? No, man. Them days are done. And hear the judge 'bout de policeman get scarred for life. Look pon this. That's wha' them do to me. And it's me who get four years. - All right, Del. - All right, wha'? Them babylon beasts worse still for them. Stop it. Don't go over this again, cos I'm leaving. Why don't you just go? Cynthia says hello. She wants to see you next time so write your name in the visitor's... - Del, are you listening? - I hear you, man. Why you never answer the letter I write you? I only got it two days ago. And I was coming to see you. I'll probably write to you tonight or tomorrow. Del, can't you write about nothing else? It's the truth, man! Wha' you want me to write about? How lovely this place is? Don't be silly. Right now is only one thing pon my mind. And it's vengeance! It's vengeance I want, it's vengeance I goin' get. If you don't like it, just gwan about your business. It's not worth going all over this again. Is it all right to smoke? Since when you start smoking? Cynthia and Tony are waiting outside. Cynthia's a good friend, you know. I know. So, you finally turn up. Where you been all this time? Pat, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. (Sniffs) - Sorry about what? - About the incident, about the court. Not turning up. I can't tell you how bad I feel, cos I know it's all my fault. It's not your fault. It is! it is! And I know it is. And I'm sorry. Oh, come on, Sonia. It's not your fault. Besides, everything happened already. Nothing you can do about it. How can you blame yourself for what happened that night? It's not you, it's Chamberlain. Pat, I know you must really hate me now. I'm sorry. Come on, Sonia. Pull yourself together. You'll only start me thinking about things I'm trying to forget. When was the last time you saw Chamberlain? I haven't seen him for a while. I don't know where he is and I don't care. Got myself a new boyfriend now. How long you been going out with this bwoy? Three weeks now. He's nothing like Chamberlain, he's really nice. He buys me this and he buys me that - Treats me like a real lady. - Yes, they always do in the beginning. Gwan like dem can't mash ants. You do remember Mr Chamberlain, innit, how him did so sweet? I remember, but people learn from their mistakes. Let's hope you do. Butl'm sure Tyrone's genuine. Pat, I was just telling Cynthia about Tyrone, how nice he is. He's a bit like Del. Have you decided what you're going to do, if you're going to stick with him? Four years is a long time. I don't know if I could wait that long. Something the matter? Being in there with all that bad company.. Will you shut your mouth? You be careful before you have the baby pon the stairs. Wha' you been doing with yourself? Nothing much. You? Getting into rules and regulations and slave existence. Imagine that. We're supposed to have come a long way. Cynthia and Sonia say hello. Give them mine. There's a whole heap of black man in here, you nuh. All man me hear gone America is here me find them. That bwoy that used to pester you, I sight him in here. He look well gone. What's wrong with you? You have something to tell me? Yeah. I'm listening. Well, I've been thinking... Four years is a long time. It was two years, now it's four. Del, listen. I know I've got to think about you. So whey you a say now, you want done everything? I dunno. Well, gwan now. Done it Go and live your life. Cos all I hear from you is your friends say this, your friends say that. Yeah, you been through some tribulations, but you a gwan like is my fault. Is my fault me locked up in a this dump. You know what it's like to be locked up? Every morning when I wake up is walls. And next man a share with you, day in day out You can't even sit down and think. Call man and scream, "Nigger, nigger, for a fight" Yeah, them's the tribulations me have to face and is now you a turn you back on me. What was I to do? I knew only I could decide. Being at the Carnival, I hoped I could forget everything for the day ♪ Steel band ♪ ♪ Reggae ♪ But I couldn't get Del out of my mind. I kept thinking of him locked away I realised how much I felt for him. I just want to know if there's going to be any kind of... future for me. Us. So whey you think? You think after you wait and wait I just goin' come out and dig up and leave you? You should know me better than that, man. It's not like we just met each other, is it? You should know within yourself. All right. I'll wait. Besides, it's good news. My appeal should come up soon and the judge might reduce my sentence. PAT: Del asked me to send him a few books to read. At first it was just a few, but then he wanted more and more. It surprised me, cos he didn't read much before. What was funny was his interest in books was rubbing off on me. Scotty! - You all right? - Yeah. - A long time I don't see you. - Long time I don't see you. - How"s Del? - He's all right. Why you not come and see him? You never even write. The first chance I get, I'll come and see him, I promise. You must tell him that. - Yeah. - I just work down the corner, you know. - What, down there? - Yeah. - From last week. - You're just by me. - You work down there, too? - Yeah. We should meet. - Where's Chamberlain? See him? - He got stabbed up by a gal. - What? - A gal stabbed him up. Serve him right. Serve him right. Hearing that made my day cos Chamberlain had that coming to him a long time. More good news. Cynthia's had a little girl. She's calling her lfe. It's Yoruba for "love". You know the book I've been reading? It's opened my eyes to some of the things about black people's conditions I didn't think about before. We're not alone, Del. I'm going now. Take care and love. PS - enclose a £5 postal order - Hello. - Hello. How are you? - Welcome. - Cynthia, congratulations. Oh, isn't she sweet? - How much she weigh? - Six pounds. Big woman already. - I can see she have your mouth. - Oh, no. Everyone says that but me no think that. Shut up. Oh, yes, I think so. I feel sorry for the poor little girl, you know? - What a handicap. - Thanks a lot! - All right. Just find the door. Cha. - No, she's really cute. Oh, I've got something for you. Some flowers. Thanks a lot. They're lovely. And some fruits. - By the way, this is Lorna. Lorna, that's Pat. - Hi. Hi. Don't I know your face from somewhere before? I don't think so. - I can't remember you. - Probably not it's just me. Every time I see someone, I think I know them. I do the same thing. Lorna's the same as you. Her boyfriend in prison. Two years now. How long's he in for? He's got two more years to serve. They gave him five years. And yours? Wait, now. Wait, wait. Me introduced the two of you and now nobody don't want to talk to me. - (All laugh) LORNA: Yes. - Where were we? PAT: Sorry, LORNA: Prison can be a lonely place, especially when you don't have anyone to communicate with outside. How did you take it when Chucky went to prison? I kind of half expected it in a way, cos Chucky wanted to do things in life. When he couldn't find what he wanted and when I had the baby, it put more pressure on him. - How did your family take it? - My family? Cos my mum...well, she didn't mind too much, by my dad, he was something else. With me, it was the other way around. My father still sticks by me. But my mother... Bwoy, from the time I get pregnant, she threw me out of the house. You know, with her, "Lord God, after all me do for you, you come bring shame upon me house." PAT: I felt close to Lorna. She was involved in a prisoners' organisation which struggled for the rights of black prisoners. She invited me along. WOMAN: ..for somebody to collect them. - I'll be there. They can come as early as they want, really. - Could I suggest, Richard... - Yes? ...that you come up with some transport and pick up the placards. I've actually got some transport. I've got some. I can collect it tomorrow. WOMAN: How much is that going to cost us? RICHARD: They'll be charging £15. Plus we supply petrol. I've got to pick it up tomorrow at three o'clock. WOMAN: Steve will go with you. - Yeah, I'll go down with you as well. WOMAN: All right I have contacted other groups who are willing to give out, hand out, our publicity material... and also attend the picket Yes, I would like to hear some suggestions which can go onto these placards, from the rest of the people. - "Don't drug the prisoners." - Yeah, things about drugs in prison. ♪ RAS ANGELS & RAS MESSENGERS: ♪ Righteous Warriors ♪ The righteous warriors a come ♪ ♪ Them coming, yeah ♪ ♪ Them coming, yeah ♪ ♪ Righteous warriors a come ♪ ♪ Them a come, them a come, ♪ them a come ♪ The righteous warriors a come ♪ ♪ Them coming, yeah ♪ ♪ Them coming, yeah ♪ ♪ Warriors coming from the East ♪ ♪ Warriors coming from the West ♪ ♪ Them coming from the North and South ♪ ♪ Them coming from all about ♪ ♪ Say them a come fe centralise ♪ ♪ In a dis ya iration rise ♪ ♪ Fe go march down the enemy ♪ ♪ And set them people free ♪ ♪ Righteous warriors a come ♪ ♪ Them a come, them a come, ♪ them a come ♪ The righteous warriors a come ♪ ♪ Them coming, yeah ♪ ♪ Them coming, yeah ♪ ♪ Them coming, yeah ♪ ♪ Yeah, yeah... ♪ SONIA: Isn't Cynthia's baby girl sweet? - Yeah.

I've got to tell you the good news. Guess what. - What? - Go on, guess. I'm getting married, Pat Innit great? Innit fantastic? - Congratulations. - Thank you. I can't tell you how happy I feel. You know how long I've waited for this and it was so romantic. When Tyrone proposed to me, it was in this Indian restaurant. Candlelights, wine and everything. When he put it to me, I was so overcome I was speechless. And when I did get my voice back, I couldn't say yes fast enough. This is going to be the most soulful a all wedding. - When is it? - Three months' time. I'm getting cards specially printed to invite all my friends. I just can't wait to see their faces when I walk down the aisle in my beautiful snow-white dress. Just think, I'm going to be the first one out of all of us. Then after the ceremony the reception's at Tyrone's parents' place - my new in-laws. They're really nice people. You can tell they like me. Pat! - Are you listening? - Yeah. Have you got Marcia's phone number? I had it but I can't find it. - I want to tell her the good news. - I have it. - Great What about Mona and Antoinette? - I'll give that to you before you go. Pat.. I want you to be my chief bridesmaid and help me organise everything. All right? Yeah, all right. Well, don't sound too enthusiastic. You still got the hump against me for Del? - Don't be so stupid. - What's wrong, then? Nothing, Sonia. DEL: You look really nice, you know. Natural. So me like you. Wha' you been doing with yourself? I've been helping out on the scheme I was telling you about. I'm really glad, you know. That is something constructive. Me tell a whole heap of men in here about it. And them really happy, you know. Cos them feel so cut off Them don't have nobody to write to. So for them it's a cool thing. And me happy to say, "Is my woman involved in a dis thing." Them all want to meet you. Yeah? - So, it's true Sonia really has settled down? - Mm-hm. She come round the other night and she couldn't stop. All she's interested in is getting a ring put on her finger to show off to her friends. Everything is for show. She want me for be chief bridesmaid. - So are you going to do it? - Yeah. If I didn't, she'd get upset Plus she'll think it's something to do with what happened to you. It's up to you, but if it was me, she wouldn't dare come near me, you nuh. You know, mek she gwan. - How's Cynthia and she youth? - Fine. Them all gone home now. I'm glad she give it a irie cultural name. - She and Tony was always...you know. - It's true, you know. Now is different, you know. Cos... I never really used to check her. I used to check her as kind of a weird gal, you know. But now me know her, she all right. Tony cool, too. - So you tell them about the appeal? - Me tell everybody. I know only half of them goin' turn up on the day. You're probably right You know... I know them man nah go free me, but I hope them reduce my sentence. Cos this place really a get to me now, you nuh. Especially now me eyes are open wider. See what's happening around me, both in ya and out deh. This place is pure madness, man. It'll be all right. it'll be all right. The longer I stay in this dump, the more chance I goin' end up in a serious conflict. (Thump on seat reverberates) Could the defendant stand, please? JUDGE: We have listened to your counsel's argument in this case, and although some might argue that the trial judge acted rather harshly, considering this is your first of fence, we do not share this view. We think it quite right that heavy sentences be meted out to those who have... little regard for law and order, as a deterrent against vicious hooligan behaviour The sentence stands. What kind of justice you call this? (Rings doorbell) Whey you want? Me no know you. You'd better go 'way before me dash water pon you. Gwan, then, if you're bad. (Laughs) - Wha' happen? - Hello, Miss Scarce. - Me no see you for a long time. - M. - How's little lfe? - She's all right. She gone to bed.
