SUBTITLES EDITED BY POWAQUATSI The Indian knew that deer moved in circles... that if the hunter calculated his moves with skill... he could run the swift deer into submission. Its hooves would bleed, and the animal stumbled. The Indian was to kneel above his dying prey... putting his mouth to that of the deer... stealing its last breath. While he had earned the swiftness of the beast... in its death he was struck by its peace and stillness... and by his own. I tried telling myself I'd done my job... defended my life. But I didn't believe me. You killed my boy, Joe Roberts. You killed my baby boy. This is how houses catch fire. Murderers' houses! Murderer! Mrs. Baker, come on. This isn't helping anything. He killed my baby! Robert, you and Jim want to get Mr. Baker there? I'm real sorry. # Captain said, John Henry # I'm gonna bring my steam drill round # Bring my steam drill out on the job # I'm gonna whup that steel on down # Lord, Lord, I'm gonna whup that steel on down # Henry said to Captain # Whoa, man ain't nothin' but a man... My brother Frank was due back from Vietnam within the week. We hadn't seen each other since I'd lost the farm in '65. I took the uniform job to make ends meet. In one of his letters, he complained... that his fellow soldiers were disturbed... by the killing they'd seen. He wrote... "Guys over here expect their hair to stay dry in the rain. " Good. Your mom called. Yeah? What's happening? First the plane was going to be delayed in Hawaii or somewhere. Then it was going to be on time again. Now she says 9:30 Tuesday for sure. He's got to go through Fort Dix. Raffael asleep? Yes, babe. You worried about today... or about Franky coming home? No. This kid today... His parents came into the station making threats. What threats? Threats. When they pulled the father outside, he started singing. Joe. - Don't move! - Hey! It's me. Shit. You scared the hell out of me. Come here. I almost kill you! He's got you trained, ain't he? You are early. I didn't want to hang around Fort Dix, so I took a Greyhound. Joey's going to be so happy to see you. Joe is so happy to see you. Come on, baby, come on. Come on, a little bit. Hey. Share with your Uncle Franky, shorty. I'm going to take Frank over to the folks. I'll be back in a bit. You'll be here? Yeah. I've got two lessons this afternoon. See you. Welcome home, Franky. Bye-bye. Bye-bye, say... Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Your uncle is a barnyard dog. Town looks same-same. So you're a dad, man. How's that? Undescribable. It's great. He's amazing. What? Just looking at you. Got to admit, it feels kind of strange... riding up front in the man's car... no handcuffs, my own brother driving. Shit. Remember we used to plug cop cars with snowballs? Pull over. Hey! Don't you do that. You did it. Hey, get the cop! Come on. All right! Fire! King of the mountain! Need an army to fight me? What are you doing? Listen, I just wanted to see you guys... meet the baby and all. I ain't going over to see Mom and Pop. What are you talking about? Franky. You caught me off balance here. What are you saying? Good-bye? Let's just call it see you later. Hey, I came to see you, brother man. What about Mom and Dad? What about them? You're going to break their hearts. You're the one who always takes shit personal. Wait. If anything, they'll be relieved. You'll see. Where are you going? You got a place to stay? You got money? I already took forty bucks from your wallet. It's in the glove box. I don't want you to go. Hey, Joe, this whole town's talking about you. Good shot, boy. Thanks, sir. You know, if I could figure out the difference... between what gets you a kiss on the ass and me locked up... I used to know my brother... like I used to know I'd always be a farmer... but drifting off on the train that day was a stranger. He looked like a hero. The closeness I felt with my brother... was with that rough-and-tumble kid... I knew before high school distractions... and then later my wife and farm occupied our time together. In the last few years before going overseas... Frank had become branded the hell-raiser of town... that he'd come to no good. Maybe leaving so suddenly was the only mercy he knew... for the grief he'd caused before. As for my parents, Franky was right. They would not take it personally. They say some of the boys coming back... are coming back real confused. Frank left confused. Well, maybe it'll straighten him out. That's what Randall said. Oh, my God, now my boy's comparing his mama to a moron. It wasn't a comparison, Mom. He's a very restless boy, that Franky. That's what got him into trouble, you know. That's why he left. I thought maybe he just hated cops. Don't say that. Listen to your mama. You are a good man, you hear me? You are a good man. That don't exempt you from having the time come... when you have to kill a man. You can't regret it. If it hadn't have been him, it might have been my son. No, sir. Don't you regret it. You just keep saying the Serenity Prayer... and you get on with it. We didn't see or hear from Frank for a good six months... when our lives took a turn. There was a crack of thunder outside. Mrs. Roberts must have jumped a foot off... Do you want anything? No. I know where it is. Thank you. She sure could make good apple pie. Do you need anything? No. Thanks, Maria. Thanks. You know, Joe, it didn't sit right with me... when you married a Mexican woman. But I look at her today... she's beautiful. She's a beautiful and good woman. Boy, was I wrong. I was dead wrong. I'm going to check the teletype at the station. It wouldn't surprise me if he were somewhere in the system. He is. Yeah. He sent out a card about a month ago... but I didn't want her to know. He's got twenty-four more days. Twenty-three and a wake-up. Oh, yeah. I've been counting. Where is he? Columbus. Now, he didn't send a card, but a girl named Dorothy. "Dear Mr. And Mrs. Roberts... "Frank hit me. "My daddy said he had to go to jail. "But don't worry, because I'm here to take care of him. " He's a likable son of a bitch. Where does he get it, Joe? I don't know. Frank, he took his clothes off to take a shit! He took his clothes off to take a shit. Look. That's a great-looking kid, Joe. Thanks. He has a great-looking mama. What'd she say? She asked would you mind playing with the kid... while we chatted a bit? Sure thing. Kids love me. Come here, Raffael. How you doing, boy? Incest product? That ain't really what she said, is it? I knew that. I got a real bad idea I want to follow through on... and I need your OK. It's about Franky, huh? I want to offer him a room in our place for a while. I got to try and get close to him again. I got to try... something. Why do you think he'll want to? I thought he had that little masochist waiting for him. Maybe the little masochist will come, too. Now, wait a minute. No, Maria, you're probably right. He probably won't want to come. Joe, we have a child in the house. I've thought about that. I'd talk to him first. If he wants to come, if he wants to bring the girl... I'd meet her and decide from there. I'm not going to say no. Doggone it! Raffael, what did you do that for? Put sand down my pants for? I'd spoken to Franky's jailers... who told me that releases didn't start till 10 a.m. I'd only driven through three states... but, man, this country looks smaller on a map. Franky seemed to have few enough moments of tenderness in him. I didn't need to interrupt this one. I thought it better to wait my turn. Collect from Joe. Hiya, baby. Yeah, I'm still here. No, I haven't yet. Well, soon, I figure. Kid's got me smoking again. I will. I know. I will. I love you. Bye-bye. Little sister, that you? Will big brother do? How about Winnie the Pooh? He's in the zoo. This I knew. He don't like the view. 'Cause he sniffs glue. Open your damn door. Are you sore? How the hell did you find me here? Nice guy. Are you going to invite me in? I owe you forty bills. So... pay me. Repeat... how the hell did you find me here today? Well, I followed you from the jail... and I've been sitting out there across the street... smoking, which I had quit, but... You followed me? What you got there? You got some squares for me? Mommy's gone. Bye, Mommy. Where the hell is she? The funeral was almost a month ago. I was in fucking jail, Joe. I know where you were. What difference does that make? You wouldn't have known anyway. What are you doing here? Did you come here to fucking guilt me to death? Meet my old lady Dorothy or Dotty... or Doe or Dute or whatever. Not whatever. Hi, Dorothy. I'm Joe. I'm Franky's brother. Nice to meet you. Joe followed us. Like a common criminal. Well, here's your beer and stuff. Joe come here to tell me... that my mother died. What do you say we all go for some chow? - Pi?atas are from Spain. - From Mexico. Catch you smoking again in the motor home, I'll shave you. That woman has a beard. That woman has a beard. Are you saying that twice... because you think we can't hear or see or what, girl? I'm going to go say hello. You do that. How do you do? My name's Dorothy. Is it real? A way-out lady I got, huh? She used to be one of them flower children... before I set her course. All right, come on. The bigger they come, the harder they fall. Frank, I want you to come back with me. What? I knew you were going to say that. So, come back with me, live at the house a while. Oh, yeah, Maria'd love that. I got Dorothy. I'm cool. You're cool? You're living in a motel. No. Just for now, till I find another place. She's staying at her folks till then. Why don't you come back and spend time with me... Raffael? Spend time with the family? - How's he doing? - He's OK. She let me touch it. She's just a little squirrel, ain't she? Bring her with you. Bring her with you. What would I do there, man? Have a few laughs with Pop? You stay out of trouble. Get yourself a damn job. I don't want a damn job. Besides, I got a deal where I'm scamming G.I. Bill checks. Far as Mr. Trouble goes... he ain't no less in one place than another. Why is that, Frank? I always figured it was Trouble had a car. You know what I mean? The law is here. Never smoke this stuff in front of the law. The law gets upset. I'm home! Dispose of the evidence! Woman. Man. - Hey there. - Hey there. He didn't come? I'm sorry, Joe. No surprise. Where's the boy? In there shooting heroin? Thank you, Lord, for the gift of this woman's cooking... for the food to cook... and the family we have to share it. Amen. Amen. You want some? Going to sell the house, I think. Are you? Think so. Where are you thinking of living? There's a trailer park over on Bright's. They got a pretty good deal there. That's nice there. They have a vegetable garden in the back... where you can rent a plot, grow your own vegetables. That's right... vegebulls. Vegetables. Vegebulls, that's right. Did you know your daddy grew vegebulls, Raffael? Your daddy was a farmer before he was a... po-lice-man. Very good, Raffael. You miss the farm, Joe? Sometimes. It's a bitch, ain't it? The same thieves that took your farm... now have you work for them. We get by fine. We get by fine. Oh, sure. Of course you do. Joe Roberts. Hey, boy, did I wake you? Who is it? It's my father. No, it's all right. I'll tell you why I called. You know that strip of molding... that you have between the kitchen linoleum... and the carpet in your living room? Well, I noticed this evening that it was loose. You might get yourself a screwdriver... and tighten up on it before somebody trips and falls. OK, Dad. Thanks. I'll take care of it. Good night, son. Good night, Pop. Who is it? It's me, Joe. How you doing? Well, it's pretty early, Randall. What's going on? Got your paper. Joe, your daddy shot hisself last night. Is he dead? Can I use your john? Mr. Roberts? Mr. Roberts? I just took a telephone call... from somebody claiming to be your kin. I think there's been some kind of family emergency. Mr. Roberts? Did you have a nice walk up here? I don't understand. What are you doing here? I just told you. Your family needs you to get ahold of them... because apparently there's been some kind of... Family emergency. Right. OK, thank you. Did you like that? Joe, Franky's girl just called. He didn't want to get on the line. Did you tell her? I told her. I don't know how much got through, man. At least he knows. Have you been on my property lately? Have you seen those hippies down there with their tents? They have fires down there at night, you know. Well, I sent Randall down to talk to them. Why don't you come over to talk to them? I'll do that, honey. - Pardon? - I'll do that. Well, if you need moral support about your dad... you could just stop by. I appreciate that. You just can't carry that stuff alone. It's pretty emotional, you know. I got a family helping me out. I appreciate it. Well, sometimes you can talk to another person... a lot more openly than you can your own family. You know, let it out? So, if you could just come over on the property... and I could even have something to eat there. Thank you. You're a lovely lady. You afraid of me? - Am I what? - Afraid of me? What do you mean am I afraid of you? Can't you open up and talk to me a little bit? What do you mean open up and talk to you? I'm offering to share some time with you... while you're there checking out these people. I don't like them there. I do own the land. I don't really want to prefer charges. They're just kids. Well, I don't want to cause them problems... but with fires and stuff, and then at night... the pop cans and everything, for crying out loud. How's your pig doing? - Pardon? - How's your pig? He's fine. He still living in that old pickup truck? Yes, he is. He's a good guy, that pig. Want to come to play with him? That's an awfully nice color on you. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Did you, uh... You missed a spot. That's just... Well, you missed a whole spot. The whole fender. I'll take care of them hippies. Don't you worry about that. You need a lift anywhere? To my house. To your house. Just get in. In front or back? Can you squeeze in there? Adios, Mrs. Roberts. What do you say? I don't speak no Mexican. Good-bye, and please give for me prayers to Mr. Roberts. Thank you, Lucy, I will. Work on your past tense. Lucy, George Washington. Glow in the dark. Are you Joe Roberts' wife? Yes. Who are you? Me? I'm Dorothy. You in there, Frank? It's me... Joe. You in there, kid? That you, Joe? It's me, kid. What are you doing in there? Working on my draw. All right if I come in? Sure, Joe, come on in. Bang. Gotcha. So I had a bit to drink. Somebody was boring me. Think it was me. You want to get dressed, Frank? Take you to see your lady. Pass me my drawers, would you? I just hope he's OK. Sometimes he hurts himself. No, he'll be fine. Joe'll bring him home. So where did you and Frank meet? Shoot. Everywhere, I guess. Excuse me. Do you have a six? Go fish. I got what I asked for. Do you have a nine? Go fish. Welcome back. I'm sorry. Feel sort of funny showing up like that. I don't know. I'm glad you're here. And Dorothy, too. Finally got lucky, huh? I sure hope so, because... she's got my little monkey in her belly. You're going to be a pop? Joe, Dorothy's pregnant. I know. So I just heard. Come here, Slappy. I knew that Frank had come back as a result of Dad's suicide. It was an unsettling thought... but that he'd come back at all... Help me with this shit! And that he was going to have a baby with his girl... was enough for me to feel that he'd not gone completely numb. What am I, black? Messy. What are you doing? This is where you used to be a little boy. It's where I grew up. We're going to be in the big room, girl. I know. I just want to smell it. Sorry. I love you more than anybody ever loved anybody before... in the whole wide world. Come on, Franky. It's our first night alone together in a big house. I love you back, OK? Honey, I got to go. I told Joe I'd meet him at 11:00. I'm late. You're a beauty. What? If you see a shooting star... or if you see anything else... will you think of me? Little sister, you really asking me those questions... or are you just stalling me here? Both. I'll be back soon. Used to be bears out here. Not so damn long ago. This place wasn't even timbered when we were kids. New ground. New ground, shit. New ground. Not new ground. What do you mean, not new ground? Old ground! Old ground, shit. Old ground. Dad said. Said what? What did Dad say? You had a Sioux village twenty-five miles north. You had another ten miles southwest. He said, when this was all woods... you had Indian runners traveling messages right through here. Getting chewed by wolves. Safe from wolves! Shredded by grizzlies. Safe from grizzlies. Safe, shit. Safe, Dad said. Said what? "Independent of time and space, the Runner becomes his message. " Ain't no wolf, no bear going to eat a message, Joe. Never fucking happen. Since when do you... Wait a minute. I get it. I know you think that way. What way? I still love you. Dad finally did something you respect. Hey, Pop should have been an Indian Runner. This place looked better when I had it. I'll bet it did. You know why? Because you had the fire in you. People got it now don't live on the land they're working. Ain't got no fire. Never had it. This fire? The fire's out now. So what? Between the cradle and now, you happened. You burned, brother. What do I have to show for it? What you got, Farmer Joe, - is knowing you once was. - On fire. Shit. Man... I burned. The land was churned. - I burned. - The soil was turned. - I burned. - They took what you earned. A lesson learned. Meeting adjourned. I've missed this, Franky. I've missed having a laugh with you. Me, too. Oh, man... what'd you do that for? Come on. OK, Big Bear. I'm an Indian Runner. I'm a message. And the message is... bet you can't find me. I'll get you. Ready to give up? God damn it. All right! All right, you win! You're a message. You win. Oh, Joseph. Oh, Joey. The message is... never trust a bear. I thought you're a tough guy. Frank worked hard, every shift he could get on. And Dorothy tended to the house... got the old place looking remarkably new. Me... I wanted to burn again. How much longer do I have to do this, Franky? Forty seconds. I don't think this is good for the baby. Thirty-five seconds. Why do I have to do this? Because I got to know. Twenty-five seconds. Got to know what? Twenty. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six... five, four, three, two, one. Good. I'll marry you... if you want. Did you say you'd marry me? If you want. Oh, my God! I'm going to be your wife! Go! Go, Franky, go! Good, little sister. It's kicking! Franky, it's kicking. Let me see. There? That ain't a kick, that's a punch. That's the last wild son you're baking, baby. Is that right, what your papa said? You going to be a big, strong, handsome dude? What about me? I got some skeeter bites that need scratching. How about you and me go fiddle with the hydraulics? Frank, don't talk like that! Why are you looking at me like that? Come on, Franky, you're scaring me. Frank, you're scaring me. Did I say the wrong thing? Is it that you don't know me... you don't know when I say something nice? Don't. You don't know how to see good things from bad things? That it? Is it that we're strangers? We're not strangers. I don't know what you're talking about. Let's eat. You eat. You eat. Stop it. Wait. Where are you going? It's OK, baby. He's just restless, that's all. Put your hands on him... and you can't bring any charges against him. You weren't here. You didn't see what he did. He blind-sided me, man! Listen to me. Get in there! No, you're not going to get in there! I'll run you in, man. Damn it, he blind-sided me! We tried to get you at home. Maria said she didn't know where you were. Inside. It's Frank. He busted this guy up pretty good. The guy's talking about pressing charges. Settle down. Take it easy. Keep him there, Jim. Where is he? He's in there, boss. I had to handcuff him to the bar rail. Looks like he ran up a tab tonight, huh, Caesar? He did that. He tells me he can sell some furniture. Can you give us a minute, Caesar? Is that right, Frank? You can sell some furniture? That's good. You blow off some steam, Dorothy's got nothing to sit on. What are you going to sell off to keep this fella... with the big eye from pressing charges against you? With your record, you could do a year on this. What can I say? I fucked up. I get in a violent way, look around a room... I want to bust it all to hell. I see a guy like that... I don't want him to look at me cross-eyed. I want that excuse to fucking do him. So you spend your life in jail? That's a bear, man. I'm a message! Jail can't touch me. Give me a cigarette. I thought you were done with this shit. Well... What about Dorothy? The baby? Can it touch them? - Outside parties. - What? Outside parties. Give me a light. I'm tired. I just want to sit here, OK? I'll sit here. I'll relax. - You got something... - Wait a minute, Clyde! - Let me get in there! - Listen to me. Boy, I've had some western times in this joint. Frank, you got a job. Oh, yeah. You got a great girl. You have a baby coming. Give me your free hand. Frank, give me your hand. What are you doing? I'm going to cut you a break. Yeah, boss? Bring that fella in here. He's just going to jump all over Frank. I know. You're bleeding. Goddamn rocket scientist, I tell you. I'm going to go, Frank. Be sure he comes by to see me tomorrow. I'll hold on to the car keys till then. All right. Good night. Good night, Joe. What happened? Ask Joe. Joe, you've done everything you can. I know. I know. I look at him... and I see this little boy... with his little toy gunbelt on. My little brother. He's not a little boy anymore. He's got a problem. He has to deal with it. Dotty? Dotty! Yeah, Franky? Come here. I guess I got a little off course last night. I know. I love you, little sister. I know. Look who I caught in the parking lot doing wheelies. I came to get the car... but if you got a minute, I'd like to talk to you. Sure. Can you follow? - Drop Frank's car at his place? - Sure, boss. You ride with me. - Randall? - Yeah, boss? Where's your gun? There it is. Damn it! That ain't funny, Frank. I know you're worried about... will I take care of business... with the old lady... when the baby comes. I appreciate it. But I don't want you to worry about me no more. I'm good, Joe. I'm good. I want you to have a good life, Frank. I know. I guess... I guess what I'm here to say is that... I'm sorry about all the shit. I'm sorry about Mom... and Pop. And, you know, I ain't said it, so... I'm saying it. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Joe. - Have. - I have. Have. My pen. She. - Had? - Has. Has. Telephone! Her. She has... Joe Roberts. What is it, Frank? We'll be right there. The baby's coming. The baby was come. Present. I'm checking the baby's head now... and the back of the baby is right over here. The baby's coming. We'll see if there's a horsy. We'll see if there's a horsy. It's all right. I'll be right back. Would you ask the doctor where Frank went? I just saw him drive off. He said he left the room just to let us in. I'm going to go find him. Did you ever want to kill someone... just out of rage... and you don't do it because you're afraid? And it's all about fear. Fear of the law coming down, sure... but mostly... fear like in sin... sin with God. Yeah, Almighty God. What if he ain't almighty? What if he ain't sacred? You might just as well have done the fella, right? Goodness... maybe ain't nothing but fear. You know? What you doing here? Looking for you. You found me. What are you doing here? I'm having a drink. Buy you one? Don't you think you ought to be by your lady's side? Leastways, over at the house? The house. Why not? Why? Come on, Frank, don't give me that horseshit! How are you, Joe? Afternoon, Caesar. You boys watch the place for a minute? I got to go pay a visit to the captain's chair. Chickenshit. Chickenshit. I'm trying to understand why you are... such a selfish son of a bitch. I want to know how to help you, Frank. You're my brother. You're the angriest man I know. I want to know why you hurt people... why you're not with Dorothy when your baby's being born. Let me ask you something. How'd it feel when you killed that fella... that kid out on the highway? Not good, Frank. No? I would have thought that felt real fucking good. It was clean. It was legal. You saved your own life. I mean, that's common sense. It's common fucking sense, right? It's how these people think. - What people? - What do you mean what people? - Oh, man, you're on a fucking tangent. - No, I ain't on a fucking tangent! These fuckers don't give you time to figure out the problem. It's a math class. The whole deal. Just like every math class, there's a clown in the front... and everybody hates this clown because he raises his hand. He's answering all the questions. What do we do? Move on. Just fucking move on, ready or not. He's deciding we got to move on. He knows his math. I hadn't even figured out about Santa Claus yet, dragons. Gasoline was my favorite smell. It's like your farm. Who grew better crops, you or the math man... who bought it out from under you? You! What's a farm for? It's for crops. That's the world, Joe... and it's a beauty. Am I right? You're right. Am I wrong? There is no common sense. Right? I'm right. All right. All right. So you're angry. All your problems are the world's fault. That's right. It's the world's fault. It's your fault. My fault. The fault of every motherfucking human being as they called themselves. Every fucking one of them out there. Life lacks tenderness, does it? Go on back there. Go see my angel get born. Life must be great if you laugh it up. No, mister... I'll just stay here and drink it down... because there's only two kinds of men in this hell. There's heroes and outlaws. Which one are you? Men come strong or weak, and you ain't strong. You're in a bar when Dorothy needs you the most... so you go ahead, Frank. You go ahead. Drink it down. You got it right. There ain't nothing. Ain't nothing worthwhile left, not even our own children. Your eyes are closed. Keep them that way. My eyes are open, Frank... and I love looking at my little boy and my wife... and my house and my little garden. And I love you, Frank. That all there is? Why does that scare you so much? Why doesn't it scare you? Why? I'm fixing a bridge for fat retired men... and their fat wives and fat fucking little kids... to drive over it in their motor homes. I'm making an impact. That's what I'm doing. That's all there is, Frank. Out there it's family. In here it's hell. I'll be right back. I'm here. I'll be right back. - What happened? - It's nothing. She all right? She's tough. Where's Frank? - Not here. - Where? God! No! Breathe! You're doing beautifully. - You're doing great. - Almost there. Oh, God! Help me! Where's Franky? What? Take a deep breath and blow it away. Keep pushing. It's just about here. This is Unit Three. I got him. The baby's coming. He's coming. The head is being delivered. Stop! Can you see it? Oh, God. Here we come out, and it's a boy. A healthy boy, it looks like. I knew I'd never see or hear from Franky again. He turned his back... on himself... and on his family. I went home that night... watered my garden... kissed my baby... and I held my wife until morning. Life is good... my brother Frank. SUBTITLES EDITED BY POWAQUATSI
