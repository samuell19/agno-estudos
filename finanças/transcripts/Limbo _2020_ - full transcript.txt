no! Thank you' Boris. You can take a seat. Now... ...can anyone here tell me what Boris did wrong? You know... ...there was better signal in the middle of the Mediterranean. You know, on the hill? They have, um... How you say? Uh, the... the wind things. You go up the hill, there is signal. Only place on the island. I go, once a week. Um... baby cat. What you call in English? - Uh... kitten. - Kitten, yes. I follow very nice kitten on Instagram. Um... Klaus. Klaus the kitten. Very nice. Very, very nice kitten. Good kitten. I come, I come. My friend! Why you cry every day'? Every day you cry! Huh? Come, come. Help me, my friend. Please, help me. Why you crying? Why you cry every day? You go first. You cry every time? You go. You go. - Hello? - Hello, Mum? - Who is it? Omar? - Hi, Mum. Khalid, it's Omar on the phone! - How are you, Mum? - Where are you? How are things? How are things in Istanbul? Don't worry about us, we're fine. How are you? What's the news? Where are you? - I'm in Scotland. - Scotland? I'm on an island somewhere in Scotland. Khalid, he's on an island in Scotland. I thought you were going to London. Yeah, I was, but... Are you working? Mum, I told you. I can't work without asylum. Well, how long is it going to take? Well? I don't know. A few months or more. More? What if they say no? What about Germany or Sweden? I heard they are nicer to Syrians there. Mum, I speak English. What's that? Your dad's asking if it's like Guantanamo. No. No, it's not like that. Do you have enough money? Huh? I'm okay. They give me a little to survive. I'm not asking that. What is it, Mum? Your dad is asking... if you can send us money? Mum... I don't have any. Do you need money? I don't get enough. No, no, we're fine. It's... Are you eating enough? Maybe I can send Makdous. You tell me how to make it. I almost forgot... How's your hand, Omar? Did you get the cast off? Not yet. I should get it checked. Omar, have you heard from Nabil? Well? No. You? Not since you left. Omar, how is the oud? ls your hand better? I don't know, I've not played since... You need to keep practicing, Omar. You can play on the street, make a bit of money. People don't care about the oud here. So, come to Turkey. Play on the street with me. You're playing on the street? Yeah, well... Dad... Hey! What's in the case, pal? You one of they refugees? You speak English, pal? Yes. Here, you better not be planning any Al-Qaeda, ISIS shite here, right? Here, I seen a programme on the telly about they terrorists. They've got these sleeping clubs where they hang out and build bombs and that. Sleeping clubs, aye? And do they have pillow fights in their underwear and all? You building bombs, pal? Maybe that's why they stuck them all up here, eh? 'Cause no-one gives a shite if they blow us up. Hey, he's no' gonna blow anybody up. I heard they, like, rape people and all. You're talking out your fanny flaps, Cheryl. What? That's what I heard. It's like a hobby for them. - Like... - Tennis. Aye. Tennis. Or like... - Cats. - Aye. Cats isn't a hobby. If he lays his hands on me, I'll cut his balls off. His balls would probably fall off if he flanged you! Fuck off, Plug. Right, wheesht, the lot of you. What's your name, pal? Omar. Right, Omar. I got my eyes on you, pal. So, don't fucking... Don't, like, blow up shite, or, like, rape anyone. Right? Right, pal? Okay. Maybe we should offer him a lift. It looks like it's about to rain. Right. Do you want a lift back up to town, pal? You don't wanna get caught in the rain. What happened to your hand? Too much wanking. Happens to the best of us, eh? Fuck's sake, Stevie. Can I sign it? I don't think a woman ever smiled at me. You were never married? No. What about your mother? Hello. But do women not cover their faces in Afghanistan? Yes. But you can tell everything from the eyes. Happy, sad... everything. Look. Guess. I don't know. Huh? You. Not smiling. See? Okay, guys... You know, I've... I've never played my stuff for anyone before. So, it's important that you understand it's about communicating... Omar, I borrow your coat tomorrow. You can get Friends from the donation centre, but you can't get a coat? Coat is high demand. Post comes tomorrow. We won't get anything. I hope you get deported. It's probably better than being stuck here with you, brother. Joey's so funny. What will you do if they let you stay? I'll go to London. I'll play for Chelsea Football Club. It's a good thing that God has made dreaming for free. I can be Wasef agent. Like Tom Cruise of Jerry Maguire. You know they put us out here in the middle of nowhere to try and break us. What do you mean? And they try to get us to volunteer to go home. We're all single, male, low priority. Past the sell-by-date. Come. Afghanistan: Best before 2003. Sudan: Best before 2006. Iraq: Best before 2005. But... ...I thought they were rolling out the red carpet for Syrians. Maybe... you are coming a year too late. Why pink? They, uh... They ran out of blue. Smells like dead cat. I need to get it checked. How long you have it? Few months. What if you forget how to play? In Afghanistan, we have story about bird who forget how to sing. What happens? He die... of sadness. It's like your thing, no? The oud. My thing? Yes. Like, some people, they have thing. And what's your thing? Freddie Mercury? He my hero. Taught me English. We have same moustache and... he Zoroastrian, like me. What's, uh... What's Zoroas...? A religion. There aren't many of us. You like it here? It's better than jungle was. In Syria, you play oud? Yeah. Were you famous? Uh... I don't know, uh... Maybe a little. My grandfather was more famous. This was his. He was the one who taught me how to play. Like, how famous? Uh... Like Donny Osmond? - No. - Umm Kulthum? No-one is that... No-one is that... No-one's as famous as Umm Kulthum. Hey, maybe I could be your agent, too. Yeah. What that say? It's nothing. It's... My brother wrote it just before I left. Where he is now? I, uh... I don't know. What you mean? I mean, uh... I guess he's still in Syria. He wanted to stay to fight. How long have you been waiting? 32 month and... five day. But... letter will come. Omar, listen to this. "When... "I am overcome by weakness, I bandage my heart "with December's frozen tree roots..." "..Trees that have promised to blossom in spring." There he is! Omar! We love you, Omar. Woo...! You will all have been asked to tell stories or draw on experiences from your past. So, we thought the term "I used to" will come in handy. For example, before I came here, I used to have a dog called Snøftemølle. But then got she rabies. So, I had to kill her. Boris used to work at the tourist info before it closed. Top tip, if you're lucky enough to still be here in winter, you might just see the northern lights. Oh, it is a spectacular sight. Some say it's the visiting spirits of loved ones. It's a once in a lifetime experience. Right. So, Boris has been working on some examples for us... - Yeah. - ..on "I used to". I used to ride my elephant to work. I used to have a beautiful house before it was blown up by coalition forces. - I used to be a... - Okay, thank you, Boris. So, anyone want to give it a shot? Abdul? I used to be happy before I came here. I used to cry myself to sleep every night... ...but now...but now I don't have any tears left. Brilliant! Abdul, you have just jumped to our next lesson on... "I used to be". I think that deserves a gold star. It's closed. - Where did you get that? - Donation centre. - What is it? - Ping pong. That's not ping pong, Farhad. Yes, ping-pong. ping-pong. Did you get a coat? No. What does it say? The doctor is only here once a month, "weather... permitting". Stuff the aubergines with red pepper... ...a handful of chopped walnuts, garlic... ...red chilli flakes, salt and pepper... and my special ingredient, but don't tell anyone, okay? Between me and you. All right? Okay, I won't. Sumac. Two teaspoons. Gives it a little zing. You can make it without, but... No, but I want it to taste exactly like yours. Then you need sumac. Once you fill the jars, you have to leave it to preserve for at least a week, okay? Okay, great. Omar, have you heard from Nabil? No, Mum. He's so brave to have stayed... Omar, I know you two have had your differences but... Mum, please. I don't want you to have a bad memory of him. Okay. Are you changing your bed sheets? Once a week, remember. Mum, please. I made it to Scotland, didn't I? I can look after myself. Hey, pal. Want a leaflet? Catch a glimpse of our local celebrity? Derek the Dolphin. - Discount with the flyer. - Thank you. He's nae a tourist, Margaret! Well, he's no' from around here, is he? Bet you never thought you'd end up here, pal, eh? We're looking at a 25% population increase with you lot arriving. Aye, but mind wee Davie McEwan passed last week. - That's one down. - That's maybe just as well. I wouldn't say Wee Davie was a racist, it's just he didn't like blacks and Pakis. I mean, no offence. Um... What's a Paki? It's like, er... tanned but no' Spanish, you know, like, folk from India and, like, er... - Pakistan. - Aye, aye. Aye, Pakistan. It's just, like, Wee Davie didn't like people that weren't from around here. I mean, legend has it we had a tourist here once, got in a confrontation with Wee Davie. Wee Davie bit his finger clean off. The wee one, the pinky. Spat it right back out into the boy's pint. Aye, that's right. Anyways, no worries. Wee Davie, he stays down in hell, now. So, you should be all right. Okay. Thank you. Hey. pal. Pal! If you want to make some extra cash, the fish processing plant is looking for folk just like you. I'll tell you, it'll be better money than the pennies you're on at the moment. I'm not allowed to work. Oh, hey, hey, it's cash in hand. Send money home for the family and that. You know, that sort of thing. There he is! Omar! We love you, Omar. - You are a liar! - Abedi crazy. - You no got respect, huh? - Mumu, you an idiot. Me? Me'? Me? I am an idiot? Hey, hey, hey... Ross did not cheat on Rachel. Rachel very clearly broke up with him. Huh?! No, no, no. You see, a break... a break is very different from a break-up, okay? Not even 12 hours had passed since that was happening! Yes, it was too soon. But, still, my guy's not a cheater! He is a dirty cheater! She is saying, "I think we should take a break." - A break, yeah? - No, you are stupid. You are dumb like the sperm of infertile elephant. You don't understand, because you are a cheater too. - I'm a cheater? I'm a cheater? - Your fada. The only reason you are still here is because of me. Okay? They don't care about you and your stupid stories. Hm, and look at where we are now. Hm? How are the Chelsea scouts going to find me here? Economic migrants. What is economic migrant? Helga and I do a very good Sonny and Cher. Mm-hm. - Don't we, Helga? - Hm. And you can win all sorts of prizes. Alan McPherson from down Strachanbrech won a goat once, for his rendition of All the Single Ladies. Did you used to be a musician, Omar? Omar is famous. Famous? - Like Donny Osmond. - Oh! - I his agent-slash-manager. - Donny Osmond... - What instrument is that, anyway? - A oud. - It's like a guitar. - Uh-huh. And you bought that all the way from Syria? Well, once you get your cast off we should organise a concert. That's a wonderful idea. Syrian music here on the island. And we could have a finger buffet at the interval. With jelly pieces and... - hummus! - Hummus. - Baba ghanoush! - Baba who? On behalf of my client... I think this very good idea. Omar? This week's special offers... Jammie Dodgers, two for one. McCoy's Jumbos, two for one. Wee Willie Winkie's, pound off. Chicken nuggets, half price. Tatty waffles, 99 pence. Chicken breasts, extra juicy, £3.50. Are you a Muslim? Yes. We haven't got Halal. Okay. Beauty products. Everyday men's moisturiser, £2.50. Anti-dandruff shampoo... Where you from? Syria. You? Glasgow. Ah! Okay, you're not a... Paki? Right. Come here. Leave that. Go on. Read that sign. "Please refrain from... "..urinating in the freezer aisle"? But I didn't do that. Not that one, that one. You see how it feels if I call you Camel Jockey... or Dusty Nuts. Goat Fucker. Carpet Pilot. How do you like it, eh? Oh... I didn't know. Right, well. You better learn how things work around here, eh? Sorry. This could be a warning, seeing as you're not from round here. And to be honest, I don't know if it is racist, coming from another brown person. I mean, it's a bit of grey area. You know like when Black folk on the TV call each other the "N" word and that? Have you seen The Wire? Do you have, uh... sumac? - What's that? - It's a spice. I've got ketchup and mustard. And soy sauce. What did you say it was called again? - Sumac. - No. Never even heard of it, pal. Where are you taking me? You'll see! Where did you get this bike? Donation centre! That's where they give free eggs. What's a range egg? Is my turn with coat or yours? - It's my coat, Farhad. - But you said, we share. Yeah, when I don't need it. They are beautiful. In Afghanistan, I have very special chicken. His name was Freddie. - Like Freddie Mercury? - Mm. You see that chicken over there? He new to group. He very special. I like him very much. I think he like me too. How do you know he's new? You can tell other chicken don't like him. If you introduce new chicken to group, there is lots of... fighting and pecking. Some other chicken, they feel threatened or afraid and they attack new chicken. Sometime they even kill it. But then if wolf come... well, they don't care which chicken better. They all the same to wolf. ♪ Oh, yes You know it? Yeah. ♪ Pretending I'm doing well ♪ My need is such Ring-ring, ring-ring. ring-ring. Hello, what is the purpose of your call? Psst! Use your notes, Abedi. The notes. Um... How are you? You are the people who are looking for some cleaners. Oh, okay. Yes, that's right. I am a cleaner. My name is Abedi. Hi, Abedi. Do you have any experience? No. Well, that's not a problem, because we do give full training. When would you be available for an interview? I am available at your earliest convenience. Well, that's great, Abedi. How's tomorrow at 3pm? Let me check my diary. I have to move a few things but I can make 3pm work for you. Well, that's great, Abedi. Well, see you tomorrow at 3pm. Okay. Thank you. Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Bye. Beep-beep-beep-beep. - Farhad? - Did he get the job? Well, I don't know. The interview is tomorrow. How do you think Abedi did? Wasef? I think he was shit and he won't get the job. Well, maybe you could try and give your brother a little more constructive feedback, Wasef. Do you want to come up here and have a go? What if I don't want to be a cleaner? Well, no-one said you had to be a cleaner. You can be whatever you want, as long as you work hard enough. You really believe that? I hope so. I mean, what do you want to be, Wasef? - I want to be a footballer. - Ha! I want to play for Chelsea Football Club. Number 11. Well, that's... really ambitious, but... But it is possible. - It's not impossible. - It is impossible for him. Why is it impossible for me? Delusional. You are delusional. Oh, good word, Abedi. What is delusional? It's like... you have a castrated goat and you still believe that he can be making a baby goat with a lady goat. So, you are saying I am a castrated goat? No, I am saying you are the owner of the goats. But I don't own a castrated goat. - Yes, but if you did. - But I don't! No! Look. What I am saying is that you are too old and not even that good at football and you will never play for Chelsea FC or any other football club. You will be a cleaner, like me. Okay... so, someone donated a box of woolly hats. I think, when I get asylum, I would like to wear suit and work in office. In the morning, I put on shirt and tie and I drink mug of black coffee and I eat eggs sunny side up. And I have desk and computer and phone. And I answer phone and I say, "Hello, how may I help you today?" Something like this. In this country, I think people like you more if you wear suit. And you famous again. Like musician in Syria. Night of Syrian music with famous Omar. What's it like? Standing in front of audience, everybody watching? Omar! We love you, Omar. You don't remember how to play, do you? It's not that, Farhad. Your hand okay? Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. Doesn't sound right. Sounds fine to me. That's the garden of our family house in spring. There, look. Here, you can see. These are the birds in the Jasmine trees and that's the fountain in the middle. Yeah, Damascus is most beautiful in spring. ♪ But I should never think of spring Chet Baker, you know it? After spring, the apricots will start to grow in the garden. My mum would use them to make Amardeen. It's like a sweet apricot leather. In Arabic, we have a saying. It's... bukra fil mish-mish. It's... it means, "Tomorrow, there'll be apricots". But you use it for something that will never happen, like... Like... - In your dreams. - Yeah. Yeah. But I never got the saying, because we always had apricots. There he is! Omar! We love you, Omar. Woo-hoo! You and Wasef still not speaking? You know how we met? Are you...? You're not brothers? No. He is coming from Nigeria. Me, I'm coming from Ghana. I was squashed below him on the boat from Libya. At night, the boat catched on fire. I couldn't get out. I was ready to die and then... ...Wasef came and grabbed me and pulled me out. I'm telling you, I have already been to hell. I would not be here if it was not for him. So, he asked me to pretend to be his junior brother. Said he would have more chance as my guardian. There was... There was something about... He really believed. You know? Now, for me, I was taking a chance. He was taking an opportunity to make his life better. He really believed. How old are you? 17. Maybe he's losing hope. No! Freddie, Freddie, no. Shh! Freddie Junior! Freddie Junior! Come. Come. Farhad. I want to introduce our new flatmate. This... Freddie Junior. What are you doing? Get that... - Get it out of here! - It's chicken. - Are you scared of chickens? - No. No, I'm not scared, I just... Did you steal that chicken, Farhad? Farhad, you have to give it back. They have many, many chicken. They'll not notice one chicken missing. If they notice, the first place they're going to look is with the migrants with no money or morals. We have morals, okay? I know, I'm saying that's what they think. Farhad, you have to put the chicken back. But... One wrong step and they will deport you, or all of us. - Like the guys at the fish factory. - What if we kill it and then we eat it? Then they will never know? Huh? We can do it the Halal way. No! Farhad, you have to give the chicken back! - This is Freddie Junior! - Farhad! Give the chicken back! - Hey, bring the chicken over here. - Give the chicken back! No. Why are you crying? I'm not crying. Farhad, give it back! It's snowing. Open the door. This is the police. Open the door! Hide the chicken. Quick! Shh! We're looking for a Wasef and Abedi... How do you say that? Don't know. Let's have a look. We can see you in there. Are you ever going to play that? Or you just like carry it around? Omar, Nabil called! He's well. He says they had an important victory in the north and things are getting better. Omar, your father says we should go back to Syria... Why? Why would you do that? He says things are getting better. I said I can bring you here, once I get asylum. I know, but we can't wait forever. - I don't want you to worry about it. - What do you mean? You can't tell me something like that and ask me not to worry. Your dad got into a fight with the police. They confiscated his oud and we had to pay a fine. They treat us like dogs here. Dad says we should go back and help like Nabil. How's Dad going to help? I don't know. I think he imagines himself saving the day. Like that big muscle-head German. What's his name? The Rambo? Schwarzenegger. - Yeah, him. - He's Austrian. Rambo's the other one, Stallone. Rocky? Yeah, that's Stallone. So, who is the Austrian one? - The Terminator. - Ah, the Terminator. Well, they're both the same anyway. I've told him it is not a good idea, but Nabil said... Put him on, I'll speak to him. Omar, they need our help. It's better than sitting around doing nothing. We can't afford to keep paying the rent here. We still have a home to go back to. Today maybe, but tomorrow? You'll get yourself killed, Dad. What are you saying? I did my national service during the October War. 1973. Dad, you're going crazy. And you? What about me? You could go back and fight like your brother. They're heroes. You were the one telling me I should leave. We didn't know what they would do next. We wanted you to be able to live up to your potential. But what are you doing there? Are you even playing your oud? You know what a musician is, who doesn't play music? Dad, you've told me a thousand times. A musician who doesn't play music is dead. So, you want me to go back and die a martyr now? That would make you proud, would it? Two brave sons, instead of one coward in the ranks. I didn't say that! You can tell you've been speaking to Nabil. I didn't say that! Maybe I can live up to my potential then? The three of us can fight and die martyrs together. - Maybe even Mum. - Omar, please. Nabil asked after you, he wants to speak to you. Well, I'm sorry I'm not a hero like him. Maybe you play something? This month, prize is mini fridge. For practice night of Syrian music with... There is no night of Syrian music with baba ghanoush, Farhad. Okay, you come with me to karaoke. - You decide with concert later. - No. But you can win mini fridge! I'm your agent-slash-manager, I decided. You're not my agent-slash-manager, Farhad. You walk around like that case is a coffin for your soul. - I try help you. - I don't want your help. I will go to karaoke, win mini fridge without you. I don't want to steal your thunder like in Friends when... This is not like Friends, Farhad. None of this is like Friends. If you are calling about an asylum claim and it has been more than 30 days since you applied, please hang up. The average waiting time... Omar! - William, pull over. - What? We'll ask him for help. Hey, Omar, we've got a problem. My dad's sheep are out on the grazing island with the lambs. We weren't expecting this weather. Do you think you could give us a hand? - We've not got much time. - Okay. Okay. Okay, everyone off, let's go. Omar, I'm gonna get you some gloves. Jim, we got another volunteer for you here. Dad, we're here. We're ready. All right, everybody, come on onboard. Omar. Some of the lambs might not have made it. - Just shout me either way, okay? - Okay. Head down that way. Listen for the dogs! We're looking for four more. Dad. Dad... Dad, I've got... I've got one here, Dad. It's not... it's not made it. Omar! Omar! Omar, we're here. Dad, have you seen Omar? Omar, where are you? Omar! You forgot your... Omar! Hold on. Omar, wait! Omar! Omar! You left this. Are you okay? You wanting a lift? - No. - Are you sure? It's freezing. I can run you up the road. This weather's mental. If you ever need anything, I know it must be hard... Leave me alone. - Are you okay? - Leave me alone, please. I'm sorry. If you need any help or anything... I don't want your help! What do you see? I don't win mini fridge, in case you wondering. How do you find it so easy? What do you mean? Do you ever think about... who you were... before all of this? I try not to. Would you go back, if you could? I can't. But, if you could. Would you go back, if you could, Farhad? What, you don't think I need to be here? Why are you here, huh? Because you want a job in an office? You want to wear a suit? You want to live your life like you're in some American TV show? Eggs sunny side up? You won't go back because your life amounted to nothing back home. I wouldn't go back... because I cannot be myself back home. Is that what you wanted to know? Omar, have you changed your sheets this week? Omar... What is it, my dear? Is everything okay? I don't know. What happened? Maybe Nabil was right. Should I have stayed? We left too... We left too, Omar. Everyone left. You're not going back? No. No. Nabil says it's not safe. But what about the money? You don't need to worry about that, Omar. But I wouldn't have made it here without the money you gave me, Mum. Nabil will send us some money for now. I'll pay you back. They'll answer soon. I promise. I'll get the money and I'll get them to bring you here. - I will do it as soon as... - I want only one thing from you... Promise me you'll speak to your brother. There is a war going on in our country. I have to accept that. But I will not have a war in our family. He was asking after you, Omar. He wants to speak to you. He sounded different this time, Omar. He sounded afraid. Omar, what if you never spoke to him again? That song came on the radio today. Remember the song by Marcel Khalife? Asfour? You played it on my birthday. Nabil sang with you. How old were you? It was your 40th... Omar was 15. It was beautiful. I forgot Nabil used to sing. He was good. ♪ A bird stood at my window ♪ And said, "Oh, little one ♪ "I beg you, hide me with you." ♪ I said, "Where are you from?" ♪ "From the limits of the sky" ♪ I said, "Where did you come from?" ♪ "From the neighbour's house," he answered ♪ "Why are you afraid?" I asked ♪ "I escaped from the cage," he said ♪ "Where are your feathers?" I asked ♪ "Fate took care of them," he said Omar, promise me you'll speak to your brother. NABIL: OMAR, CAN WE TALK? NABIL: OMAR, ARE YOU THERE? Nabil here, somewhere. Don't leave a voicemail, I won't get it. Just send a text or whatever. Okay, later. Jesus! It's freezing. Last time I saw snow like this was... That year in Damascus. We tried to make a snow... Brontosaurus, or was it a camel? No. Everyone thought we had made a camel, - but it was a Brontosaurus. - Ah, yeah! Did Mum make it? The apricot tree isn't there any more, Omar. I was waiting for you to call. Hmm. Are you happy to see me? You left without saying goodbye. You wouldn't have let me go. - So, you ran away? - I didn't run away. Why did you have to stay? - You know why. - What? To fight and die like a martyr? ♪ With our souls, with our blood, we sacrifice for Syria Stop it! What do you want, Omar? You want me to tell you that I wish I had left like you? That you did the right thing? You want my blessing? I don't need your blessing. No, come on, here... Preserve our culture with your music. Your talent. The oud as your weapon. You'll make us all proud. Omar? I just want it to be how it was. You know... I've not even played the oud since I left Syria. But your hand's better? Not once, why? It doesn't sound like it used to. It doesn't feel the same. Omar, a musician who doesn't play music... Is dead. I know. Don't do that, you will make me cry. Stop it, Omar. I'm scared. - Why are you scared? - I'm scared for you. You were never afraid of anything. Even when we were kids. That's not true. I was afraid of Auntie Zainab's kisses with those big red lips. We would all be covered in red stains. And Mum would rub our faces really hard to get the marks off. It was so sore! I didn't want to leave, Nabil. I didn't want this. Come on, play me something. Omar. Come on, Omar. Show me. I'll tell you how it sounds. Come on. Let me escape the world for a moment. Farhad? Farhad. Farhad? What happened? A letter. - Successful. - Mm. That's, uh... I'm sorry. - There was nothing... - It's okay. Congratulations. - That's great! - You don't hate me? No. No. I'm sorry, I... I, uh... I didn't mean to, uh... I've never met anyone, um... You know, like, uh... Neither have I. Guess. So, what are you going to do now? I have to go city and get my papers. And what about the concert? I will need my, uh... agent-slash-manager to be there. You remember how to play? Ho! I want to speak to William. Listen, uh, when we get across, I want you to stay on the boat until I get back, okay? Why? Please, just stay on the boat. Rest in peace, my friend. You better buy it, though. It's here to sell. - Thank you. - So... ...when's the concert? Sorry I late. Donation centre? Wait. Very elegant. What are you doing with Freddie Junior? I have to go mainland after concert. Lie to me and tell me you'll be back. Thank you. There he is! Omar! We love you, Omar. Woo-hoo!
