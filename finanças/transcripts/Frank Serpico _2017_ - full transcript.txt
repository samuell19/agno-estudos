I had, uh, more lights here. I had, you know, makeup lights here. I had spray bottles. All different kind of makeup. Uh, I had to go to work. I had to go arrest prostitutes.. ...and I hated the job. I told myself, "Frank "you're goin' on stage tonight. "And, uh, the audience is out there and, uh, you gotta really put this over." I told myself I was an actor. And, uh.. I just had to sell my role, you know. I got my training in the streets of New York where I played many roles from a doctor to a derelict. And, how well I played those roles my life depended on it. Tell us about the real Serpico. This is a story about a real American hero, but it's not a happy story. Only one man has successfully exposed the system of cover-up and corruption in. New York's Police Department from the inside out. His name, Frank Serpico. Serpico made repeated pleas to police and city officials to investigate widespread corruption in the police department. Frank is an honorable man, a dedicated man, a loner. His decision is what prompted Peter Maas to write the book that inspired the movie. The shattering impact of Serpico. He was forced to become an outsider because he tried to live up to an ideal of honest police work. Like the movie "Serpico" the real Frank Serpico was shot in the face by a narcotics dealer. The detective has bullet fragments still in his skull. For a time, some people suspected a set-up. In 1972, Serpico exiled himself and left the controversy and his country behind. The bullet was never removed because it, it shattered. I got a piece in my jaw. One piece came out my ear one day. You know, I got a 9 millimeter piece nudging my carotid artery. I couldn't open a door without being very cautious if anybody was behind it. These were all, uh, after-effect of, uh, of, uh, of what happened. Alright. Let's see if I can make it outta here. See if my guy's here. There he is. Okay. See that crow? Uh, I'm gonna put food out for him. I meet people today and they say, "You were a cop? How... how could you have been a cop?" They think that cops only think one certain way. In fact, even before I became a cop I was a youth social worker. Uh, police officers, to me wasn't just locking up criminals... it was keeping kids out of jail. You know, it was a calling to me. Both my grandfathers were coalminers. My father's father, on his last paycheck was stabbed and robbed of his payroll. But he made it back to Italy and he impregnated my grandmother and then he died. Maybe in my mind, as a little kid hearing that story was, you know, "I'll catch that guy some day." You go out there looking for justice. When Italian-Americans came to this country they were not even considered part of the white race. At Ellis Island there was a separate category for Southern Italians. These immigrants, they're different from the previous generations of Italians who had come from Northern Italy. They're illiterate. They have a different religion. They'll never learn the English language. They're practically Africans. Once they got to America, what did they find? There was someone who said "I came to America, I found out. "A, the streets are not paved with gold. "Uh, B, they're not paved at all. And, C, I was supposed to pave them." For someone like Serpico's parents it must've been not just the cultural shock but a kinda psychological trauma. There were shoeshine booths up there. And, uh, here was the counter and here was the workspace. My father, he had canaries all up in there and every time he'd turn the machines on, they would sing. And, when the bird was born sometimes the parents would abandon him and my father would feed them. He was a prisoner. He was a POW. And, uh, ahem, I guess you learn things from human nature and and this was his, his respite, you know. He never heard of the word "zen" but he was, uh, he was very zen. I used to shine shoes in his store. I remember, it was a sunny day like today and I'm standing over here and I see this big burly cop walks in. And, uh, he walks up and he says, "Gimme a shine." And I'm looking up at him like, "Wow. I'm shining the shoes of the law." I gave him the best shine I could, you know. He steps down, turns around and walks out the door. He didn't pay me. He didn't say thank you. Although he had the shield of the law he demeaned it by his actions. The following week my father looks and he sees him coming. And he's waiting for him as he comes in the door. "Good morning, Officer. You want a shine?" He said, "Yeah." "Ten cents. Pay first." The burly cop was never seen again. What I learned, I learned from my parents. My father said, "Never run when you're right." Guy's a hell of a parker. It feels different. Well, I was much younger, then. I lived here all through the '50s. My early, uh, teens. America's society did succeed in instilling in immigrants that you have a larger public responsibility. You know, to be educated, to vote, to participate. But there's something else going on too. On the one hand, you grow up and you're told to respect authority. But, if you listen to the adults speaking at the adult table there's always a kind of skepticism about political power. There are people with power and there are people who have to bow down before power. You have to be suspicious. What happens when you go into these institutions and you see that it's a racket? When I got out of the service, I went to Brooklyn College. And what did I study? Police Science. I would even come to school with navy blue pants and a trench coat because I wanted to play the part. You know, they say if you play the part you become the part, right? When I became a cop I wanted to be in the Youth Squad. I went to one of the locations. I saw the guys that I worked with. And they say, "Hey, Mr. Serpico." Cop says, "Where do you know this guy from?" I said, "I was a social worker." And he, with his club.. This is the rehabilitation they understand. That's the attitude. There's some memory I'm trying to recall here. I used to climb up that ladder push the, uh, lid off. Helped me a lot when I was a cop. I went up a lotta those. So, I'm workin' in uniform. You know, I'd stop somebody and the guy'd say, "Officer "can you give me a break? All I have in my wallet is $35." The guy's gonna bribe me, you know. Go back to the car. The old guys that are supposed to be training you they called them "hair bags." I say, "This guy just offered me $35." He says, "Get in the car. I'll take care of it." He comes back with $35. "Here, we split everything." I said "No. I don't... I don't want that." That was my first lesson, the job is not on the level. And it just got worse and worse and it went bigger and bigger. I used to live on these streets. People couldn't find the West Village. It wasn't on the numerical grid that the rest of New York was on. We came there because we didn't identify somehow, with the rest of society. You were artists or you were intellectuals or you were gay. This was no place for a police officer to live. Really, no place. I knew he was a policeman when I moved in. I don't know if he told us but we knew. We were like simple hippies. So, we were supposed to be like. Capulets and Montagues or something. But he must've been attracted to the same things we were attracted to. Individuality was very important. And I think I gravitated toward him as a person because I knew he had that. I knew he was on our side. It was a... a very independent view of what a policeman could be. He was the type of guy that I could click with. You know, he was a Brooklyn guy, so was I. He was interested in making collars and, uh, so was I. And, uh, we got to be friends. We had a vision of what policing was about. It was kind of a little naive but, nonetheless, you know, it's something good. My generation of cops were different thinking than a more stereotype image of a cop. There's more, uh, serious things to do in policing and not, uh, harass or arrest someone for a minor charge. As I recall, Paco got what I was trying to do. And I found out that he, uh, lived in The West Village not too far from where I lived. And we started our friendship from there. You know, if you get a rapport going and people trust you the police could do, uh, good things. We spoke the language, we... we understood certain things because you were raised up that way. PEP was about community policing. The difference in then and now I wasn't a bully. I was a police officer doin' a job. Well, Frank's story is very deep and hard to get to the bottom of. He knew exactly what, uh, he thought uh, police in a free society ought to be. And, it gave him problems with h... his fellow officers. The police from the old school saw him as a traitor. Not to face that is not to really understand the whole story. That is the story, in... in a way. If you want an ethical society you have to work at it all the time. The most important and hardest place to have it is among your enforcers. And Frank, he immediately saw that and tried to address it alone. Which is a tough role.. ...and we see where it, where it took him. So now, there I was, in the detective division. I had a beard, I wore sandals and I lived in Greenwich Village. And, they were using me undercover. We knew he was an undercover cop. He had some disguises that we would occasionally see him in. There was something theatrical about him in his profession which I understood, being in... in theater arts. He did it well. I had to go to work. I had to go arrest prostitutes and I hated the job. "Hello, you'll give me a good time?" "Sure. What do ya like?" "Uh, you know, what I like." "What do you do, eh, something special?" "Eh, how much is cost?" "I don't have this kinda money, you know?" "Yeah, that's the best you can do?" "You didn't take your clothes off yet?" "Uh, is, uh, police. You under arrest." "Ha-ha, come on, let's get outta here, Shirley." "Hey, you no go no place, eh?" "Hey, what are you gonna do with that cigarette lighter?" Boom! Into the mattress. "Oh, Jesus!" I was one of those undercover guys. When you lie in life, and we've all lied there's a stress to that because you have to keep that lie up. Well, now, we're asking you to do lying at the ultimate. You're gonna become a whole 'nother person. You have to mimic the people that you're trying to infiltrate. Coming back to being who you really are is difficult. Most of the guys in the undercover were married and had kids. He was a single guy living in Greenwich Village. And maybe they sensed that... that he was too much of a... a free-wheeler. You know, he may wind up living with these people that he's working with. 'Cause that does happen in undercover. At the time, the department was run mainly by the Irish Catholics. And Frank was looked down upon. All he wanted was to be a detective and get the gold shield. And, th... they figured, "If he wants it we're not gonna give it to him." The NYPD, at the time was basically a club atmosphere. The institution like Stepford Wives. They want everybody to toe the same line have the same opinions, do the same job. They can control that cop. But, there has to be room for the innovator. And Frank is probably the most innovative individual who's ever worn an NYPD uniform. So, you're no longer the go-along-to-get-along kinda guy. That becomes very uncomforting to the establishment. One night, I had to use the bathroom. And the lights go on. And it's the, uh, inspector. And he says, "Serpico, what were you doing in the shithouse in the dark with another man?" I said, "What?" And he says, "I couldn't stand you "from the first day you walked in here "with your long hair and your beard and your sandals and livin' in Greenwich Village." So, I knew what was gonna happen. I'm gonna get flopped back into uniform. I went out and I bought me a tape recorder. It was the best in the market at that time. Couple of days later my phone rang. "Serpico?" "Yeah." "You're back in uniform effective Monday morning, 70th Precinct." That was the real causal factor in my whole life. If that didn't happen, we wouldn't be here today. If he had come in the squad history would've treated him more gently. He went back to uniform and then he ends up plainclothes. That was not a good thing. Now, I'm in uniform. The captain calls me in. The plainclothes exam is comin' up. There's a new department director. "From now on, nobody goes into the detective division "unless you put in four years in plainclothes "keep your nose clean, right into the bureau, gold shield. I'll put you in for plainclothes school." I said, "Captain, don't do me any favors. Plainclothes, are you kidding me?" He goes, "What?" I said, "What? You know what." In the early 60s the department wanted to beef up the narcotics enforcement. They brought all these plainclothesmen in. But the problem with the plainclothes a lot of them were on the pad. How many inspectors did you pay off? Well, I paid one. How much? Anywhere from $25 to $50, per week. Have you personally seen police paid off like... Yes, I've seen this. And you see it quite often. Do you report that? Who are you gonna report it to? I was to give them 50% of everything that I sold. Did you meet him every night? Practically every night, yeah. And you reported to him how much you had sold and you gave him his cut? Penny for penny. The pad was an organized system of payoffs. And it went right up to the top to the highest levels of the department. And higher. Who knows? Corruption was rampant. There were some guys that did some bad things. They took me in a hallway. They took two bundles of stuff that I had and a $150 I had. And they let me go. The cop took everything except my watch which he gave to me back, and let me go. They told me if they see me around again they'd bust me. But they, they never did. Police officers, being exposed to the large volume of drug traffic in the community sort of become immune to the fact that they are dealing with, ha ha, living death and some of them may look upon this as a source of income. Businessmen, gamblers and narcotics dealers were paying the New York policemen millions of dollars a year. This was all run by the police department and the plainclothesmen which Frank ended up being in. Everybody was paying bribes. It had become part of the scene. And that made it hard to fight. Does anybody in the community trust the police? I really don't know. Put it this way, I don't know of any that do. There's a lot of cops that, uh.. I think Paco even said this they're afraid to be honest. I mean, that's a bad system. And you're afraid not to go along. And, uh, that doesn't do well for society. Look, they just shouldn't be able to do it with impunity. For this precinct, cases reported, murder... Everybody knew. Plainclothes was rotten through-and-through. Serpico! The captain says, "Nobody can make you do what you don't wanna do." And I thought, "Well, that's true." We're down in a darkened cellar precinct. Serpico. And this officer in uniform. He says "Serpico?" "Yup." He hands me an envelope. I said, "What's this?" He says, "It's from Jewish Max." I open it up and there's $300 in there. And then, we're cruisin' around. I say, "Hey, look-it over there, there's some action over there." "Yeah-yeah, don't worry about that. You gotta respect the contract." It means, he's on the books, he's payin' off. And the guy's telling me, "You know, why don't you take the money?" You know. And I says, "I don't need the money." "Yeah, but, you know, we'd feel a lot better." And I said, "What do I care what you feel? You know, I like to sleep at night." That's when I called up this guy that I met in plainclothes school who said he had the connections. Durk. Life Magazine asked me to do an article about Sergeant Durk a Jewish doctor's son from Amherst who was on a crusade against corruption. It was a fascinating setup. The... the Jewish doctor's son from Amherst and, uh, and Frank Serpico who, who was really a street guy. An Irish Catholic department and these two outsiders and it didn't have room for either of them. Frank and David Durk saw my article on the front page of The Times about cooping. "Cooping" is police sleeping on duty. And so they called up and Frank told this long, complicated story with all these ranks of deputy inspector and the assistant deputy inspector and so-and-so and all this police slang. And I just didn't understand it, you know. But I thought it was interesting. At some point, Durk comes to me and he says, "Look, there's corruption all over the place." He tells me about going to meet with the deputy mayor, Jay Kriegel. How he met with, I think, Arnold Fraiman. Nobody's paying attention. And so they gave up and said. "Oh, well, maybe we can get something at "The Times."" That's what we did. Durk told me he has been working with a "New York Times" reporter because he's absolutely exasperated. "Would you meet with this guy?" And I said, "Well, wh... what for?" He says, "Well, just to give him "background information about, you know, how Narcotics works." So I said, "Alright." So I met with David Burnham, and I told him whatever I knew. About 298, the first district.. But I really didn't know that much because I just wanted to stay away from it. You know, I... I had the feeling that there was problems.. ...and I just wanted to stay away from it. But I knew it was coming because Dave told me he was working on it. Obviously, being a reporter for "The New York Times" it was gonna be an expose. The editors were doubtful. This makes a very sweeping charge against the police, at a high level. This was really a world that th... they had never gone down before. I eventually pulled a fast one and told the mayor's press secretary that we had this big investigation going. A week later, Lindsay announced that they're gonna form an in-house group to, uh, investigate corruption. An investigatory commission filled with people who were beholden to him, friends. And this got laughed out of existence almost immediately by "The New York Times" and by everybody else. Can't be in-house. They have to have outsiders. We had to run the story. So, now "The Times" piece is about to come out and an official investigation is started. Officer Serpico, thank you for your testimony. You've already testified at least one time at this point. Oh, yeah, and they knew about it. That might've been a possibility. Instead of putting me in Narcotics undercover, the most dangerous job that there is. Now I'm working in Narcotics. My sergeant comes up to me. "Listen, Serpico. You don't pull the shit you pulled up there. "That was chicken shit. "We're talkin' about real money here. "And with that, you don't fuck around. Do I make myself clear?" So, I come to work one day. I'm sittin' in a car with two other officers. And one guy moves the rearview mirror and he says, "We heard you went to the grand jury and didn't hold back nothin'." I said, "Really? Where'd you hear that from?" "We got our informants." "The story's comin' out tonight in "The New York Times."" And I thought, "Son of a bitch!" And that's when I had to really watch my facial expressions. And the first chance I got, I called Burnham. He said, "Yeah, the story's comin' out tonight." It is probably true that there isn't a city in the country that doesn't have some form of problem with corruption. What is your own philosophy on corruption in relationship to the city government? It's a constant battle. You must wage that battle every day and every night. Uh, and the best possible way I think to, uh, to wage that battle is by, is by constant opening up of everything. The worst thing of all is secrecy. Don't move. Don't move! Get your hands up! There was a police scandal every 20 years. Which didn't mean that there was corruption every 20 years. It means the corruption got exposed every 20 years. Previous exposures of police corruption had largely come from the outside. They'd never come from within the department. So, Serpico was absolutely exceptional. He knew, literally, where the bodies were buried. He could do a lot more damage to this web of corruption than anyone had before. Institutions evolve and devolve in a certain way where corruption is absolutely unavoidable. The question then becomes how do those institutions deal with it. Uh, and then how does the larger society deal with it. The fact that he actually remained in this position is one of the great moral exemplars of our time. When you find people that don't identify with power, they're very special. People like Frank Serpico that are willing to put themselves at risk. And, they're important not only for what they tell us but also for the courage that they model for the rest of us. They remind you that you too, um, you too can, can be honest and can speak the truth, and can confront power. The system has ways of swallowing up these people. Either you resign yourself and you become cynical or you speak out and the system destroys you. How ya doin'? Good. We haven't seen each other in 50 years? At least. Were you in Plainclothes? Just Narcotics. You didn't do Plainclothes. - No. - Oh! I went to Narcotics. And then, I came in and I was part of the team. Right. The captain called us in the office and said that you were coming. "I'm gonna stick you with Frank." And what was your reaction when... "Why us?" And what had you been hearing about him? That he was a rat. That you were squealing on cops taking money. Oh. And that was bad? Yes. Well.. Nobody trusted you. They couldn't figure out what you had or what was behind it all. I don't believe half of the bullshit they're saying. But, you know, when you keep hearing the same things yeah, I don't believe it, but, I'll watch what I'm doing. Otherwise, say, "You don't have a wire on you?" You know, half-joking, half-believing, he did. But, you see, as a cop, heh, you have to trust the people you're working with. If you don't, you're in trouble. There was this scene in the movie when I bought my.. ...Browning 14-round, uh, handgun and the guy says, "What are you expecting an army or something?" And I said, "No, just a division." But, in a sense, it was an army. It would've taken less to go up against a machine gun nest because there, I either make it or I don't. But going against something that is alive and still in existence.. ...it cost me many a... a sleepless night. What got me through was I believed that I was on the side of right. You know, you have some unscrupulous guys in the police department. Serpico. It was told that some of these guys had bodies. So, if you was not liked and... and you had a problem, you was in trouble, they may take a little while longer to get to you and respond. All the way through this thing I would occasionally get calls from policemen, I presume.. ...saying they were gonna kill me or they were gonna kill my children. The first time it happened, I called Sid Cooper.. ...who was a friend and.. I gotta watch out, I'll start crying. He was a really great cop. And I said, "Sid, what do I do?" And he said, "Listen, kid, "you never worry about the death threats you get. You know, you worry about the ones you don't get." Getting back.. ...to the night in question.. This was my .38 Special. We were supposed to meet at the 80th Precinct. And I remember walkin' in that night there was like this... cold eerie feeling. These cops, they somehow knew me. "We're gonna make an arrest tonight. We got an informant." "You gotta get us in there." So, we're sittin' there and, uh, that's part of what you do, you observe. But, how are you gonna do that unless, uh, you know, you go in the building? And they said, "Well, why don't you go up there and, uh, see what you can do, you know?" So, I have on an army jacket and, you know, boots. And I get into my role. For five years, I was talking about police corruption, and they all knew about it. They knew about it all the way to the top. And, all of a sudden, I find myself up here. Somethin' told me, "Get outta here." I was gonna take my gun, my shield and.. And, then, somethin' in my head said. "Nah, you can't do that. You took an oath." And so I thought, "Well, let's get it over with." These two officers were standing by. One was here. Had his revolver drawn. And the other one was standing here. We finally decided I was gonna make a buy here. "Once you get the door open, leave the rest to us." - And.. - Police officers! I... I turned, like this, and hit the door and I had up to here in the door. And he was right behind the door. I don't know how time works. What the... are you waiting for? Give me a hand. Meanwhile, I got this guy covered. And when I turn back.. You know, whoever expects that they're gonna die.. ...and then all of a sudden, bang! It happens. The first thing went through my mind was, "This is it?" Something was looking down at my body.. ...in a pool of blood. I thought, "I wonder if the back of my head is missin'." And then I thought, "Wow, no pain." No pain. It's the passage from the darkness to the light. And then I heard voices calling my name. And, I shouted silently back. "No. No, I'm not coming. I'm gonna live." If I get angry enough, I'll live. I heard jingling of some keys coming up the stairs. And I heard one cop say to the other guy.. "I think he's a narc." So, they carried me down the stairs. I couldn't even remember how many stairs we went down. But we kept goin' down.. ...and that was it. And I said, for years... at least I know there were two cops... that.. ...you know, took me to the hospital. And years later, an ex-cop wrote a book. He was riding with this cop one day.. ...and he said, "Turn here. "You see that building? That's where Serpico was shot. "I was one of the two cops that picked him up. "If I knew it was Serpico I woulda left him there to bleed to death." We were all shocked.. ...that he had been hurt so badly and that it was possibly a setup. My first thought was, "Oh my God," and then, "Who did it?" Was it a cop who did it? That was the great fear of everybody. Serpico thought that the other cops had left him there to die. That's what he expected. He knew he was an outsider. He knew that no one was gonna help if he got in trouble. Frank can't get into the apartment. Someone comes running in. Bang. Shoots Frank. As it's happening.. ...I'm sayin' to myself, "My partner's shot." "What the hell am I doing here?" You can think of a million things in a matter of seconds. The police arrive on the 10-13. Frank is a bloody mess. I'm tryin' to wipe the blood away and he wakes up and says, "What're you trying to do, s... smother me?" You know, he... he can joke at a time like this. Well, I still wonder if it was really uh, a setup or a coincidence. And people think different ways. Seemed like there was an unusual delay in getting him help. When I got out of the hospital, the first thing I did I went to Internal Affairs. And I said I wanna see a copy of the record of the night I got shot. And they said, "It's confidential." I said, "Good. "I am conducting my own confidential investigation, "and if you don't show me that fuckin' report right now you're gonna hear about it tonight on national television." And he brought it out and it said, "signal 10-10." That's a call put out by a civilian. It was never a 10-13. They never called a 10-13 when he was.. Yeah. What does that make you think when you hear that? Well, you know, like I said, you know, he made a lot of enemies. No 10-13? That could've been a typographical error. Doesn't make sense at all. Well, why would it be a.. Where was the 10-13? Was the place loaded with cops? A sector car responded. One? One sector car. Did you ever have any 10-13s called on ya? - Yes. - Alright, so what happens? - A lot of 'em came. Yeah. - Everybody comes. So, you're a cop, and you get shot and there's no 10-13. How do you feel? Bad. I just don't believe that. No matter what the guy... But, Cesare, that is a fact. Yeah but, what you have to understand is after the incident, I completely forgot about it. I know that. You said that. But I'm sayin', put yourself in the other guy's position. He's a cop, he gets shot, and there's no 10-13. And he knows that people don't particularly like him. Well, this.. You know, as a policeman, you run into so many things. After 20 years, it's just another incident. But you felt like that even about a fellow officer? Eh, I know it's a silly thing to say, but, yeah you just accept it. Anybody that has a badge.. I don't care what you think of somebody. You... you gotta be there for them. To have somebody not be there for ya, it's gotta be the emptiest feeling in the world. And to... to sit here as a cop, and see that and to think that somebody didn't help.. ...it hurts. It's not right. It's not right. Because all you have is each other on that street. Okay, he gets shot in the head and "New York Magazine" calls me up and says, "Serpico's been shot. Go do an article on him." So I spent a good deal of time with Frank preparing that article. And he was certainly a fascinating person. I went to this pad he had in Greenwich Village which was jammed with all kinds of things. An enormous sheepdog an aquarium, et cetera. We used to walk out on to the pier and he had all these guns. All these guns. At least two guns, and maybe more. And he was very winning and, uh, attractive. Every description that he made turned out to be correct, for one thing, and was vividly done. Everything he said was quotable and fascinating. You have to forgive a writer who falls in love with subjects who provide him with terrific material. And Frank did that. So, I write the article. The picture on the cover is an X-ray picture of Frank's skull with a bullet in it. Looking back, it's almost amusing. Not to Frank, it wasn't. They would put signs up on the door. Yeah. When he was convalescing. It was.. It.. That was shocking. We were shocked that the police turned against him so... uniformly. Didn't make sense to me at that time. And there was no protection. That was the other thing. Where was the protection for him, from that? There was nothing. He was just alone there. I remember layin' there in that bed. Man, I had off-the-scale migraine. I had fragments in my head, of lead. And I'm laying in bed.. You know, and my head is.. It feels like it's gonna burst. And, I remembered when I was doin' combat training.. We had to crawl and they were firing live rounds over our head. And, I got a piece of sand in my eye. And it was driving me crazy. I couldn't get it out. And they... they said, "Stay down! Stay down!" "How do I... how am I gonna get this out of my head? It's... it's in my head." And the phone kept ringin'. The police department kept callin' me. "Serpico, this is a bed check. You gotta answer the phone." Get this outta my head. It's in my head. You know, just kept harassing, harassing me. They were just tormenting me. Those were five torturous years. It's mental torture in the same way somebody ending up in a prisoner of war camp was tortured.. ...because what they're forced to believe is that what they know is not the truth. There's nothing more frustrating in the world to tell somebody the sky is blue and then have the establishment say, "No, that's green" and look at you like you're crazy. Frank Serpico is similar to a guy who goes to war. A lot of these soldiers are traumatized because they were in untenable positions. His nervous system is stuck. And he's just playing a tape that he's not gonna get out of because it's frozen in time and space. Back in World War I, we called it "shell-shocked." When you go through what Frank Serpico's gone through.. It's not only when it's goin' on it's when triggers bring him back to that original experience. When you have an experience, you know it happened. When you have a traumatic experience you think it's happening. One day, after I got shot.. ...one of my neighbors intercepts me and he says. "Paco, Paco, don't go home." He said, "They're waiting for ya." "Who's waiting?" "Couple of shady-looking characters parked across the street. They've been there all mornin'." So, I go around the block and I come this way, and I have my gun. And.. "Who's there?" "Police. Open up." "Let me see your ID." I had a tape recorder. And I got my 9 millimeter. "What do you want?" "You trust anybody?" "No." "Is that thing runnin'?" "Is your mouth runnin'?" "Turn it off!" "As long as your mouth's runnin', it's runnin'." "Call Chief Cooper right away!" I called Chief Cooper and he says, "Where the hell you been?" We just got it on the wire. They got another hit out for ya." I said, "Take these pricks outta here. I don't want 'em." How long was it after you were shot while this was all going on? It was going on all along. Even, even when I went into court to testify. These hearings are going to present some of the evidence that the department has a serious corruption problem.. ...which must be characterized as extensive. The Knapp Commission was a specific response to a citywide scandal. Corruption was something that everybody kind of assumed existed but nobody wanted to admit. We're saddened and troubled and deeply hurt when, uh, the wrongdoing of some of us is exposed. I believe that it involves a small number of, uh, people. The police brass didn't want to admit it. The politicians didn't want to antagonize the police brass. The cops kept saying, "Well, there a couple "of rotten apples in the barrel but this department is fine." - What is he doing? - He's under arrest. And what Frank came out publically to observe was that at least in his barrel.. ...all the apples were bad. He triggered an investigation that indicated this might be true in the department as a whole and our job was to find out, was it? Uh, he started it all. But Frank didn't wanna testify. He was convinced that we were gonna sandbag him. He hired Ramsey Clark, the former attorney general to represent him. We spent the night before, here, in the apartment. He had several pistols stashed around. And, finally, we decided it's time to go. He was sure walkin' too close to the building. We slinked down to 7th Avenue and, uh, dropped down into the subway. He was very nervous on the subway. But, you know, if you got shot in your face like that, uh.. ...he's got reason to be nervous. And probably some pretty powerful interests were worried about what he was gonna say. You know? Anybody that knew him knew he was gonna say exactly what he thought. He warmed up and.. ...his testimony was, uh.. ...pure Serpico. Through my appearance here today, I hope that police officers in the future will not experience the same frustration and anxiety that I was subjected to for the past five years at the hands of my superiors because of my attempt to report corruption. The problem is that the atmosphere does not yet exist in which an honest police officer can act without fear of ridicule or reprisal from fellow officers. See, that was the one thing I have against you. You exposed corruption but only cops got hurt. I was talkin' about the system. It went all the way up to the top. That's why I didn't wanna wear a wire. I didn't wanna get the guys I was workin' with. The only problem I have.. ...with Frank is if he wanted to do it, great. I wouldn't do it. You wanna do it, get the bosses because without their okay, it will not happen. Now, how do you lock up a boss? How do you go after these guys? I don't know. I didn't even try. Yeah. Was any, uh, suggestion made that you carry an electronic device yourself in investigating th... uh, the corruption? Yes. And what was your reaction to the suggestion? If I personally wore a wire.. ...the only information I could get was on a patrolman level and I was not interested in just locking up patrolmen, that I wanted to, uh, take it to a much higher level where the problem lied. And who was present at the meeting? Myself, Detective Durk, and Commissioner Fraiman. To the best of your recollection, what, uh, was said? I again in... informed the commissioner of all the facts that I had related to the other people. And what was Commissioner Fraiman's reaction? He said, "Well, uh, what do you want me to do about it?" We came to the conclusion that the police department and its top brass and the mayor had not.. ...acted on... on Frank's information.. ...and that they should have. The events tell the story. You had Arnie Fraiman.. ...an appointee of John Lindsay. You had Jay Kriegel. The former Commissioner Leary, an appointee of Lindsay. They all sat on their hands. So, this corruption is very, very complex and deep in the... in the city. Mr. Armstrong, do you come away from this hearing believing that the majority of the plainclothesmen in this city are corrupt? Testing, one, two, three. What kind of affect do you think the Knapp Commission Report is having on your fellow officers? Uh, the morale has gone, uh, down very much. We feel pretty low. If they did the job that they intended to do, to root out corrupt policemen every honest policeman would stand up and take their hat off to 'em. But they didn't do that. They got on television and they used a big wide brush and they painted everybody. Everybody. The reaction to the Knapp Commission was ferocious. There was a lotta hostility. I don't think anybody likes people looking into whether they're corrupt or not. And if you have an organization that's a quasi-military organization that is used to feeling in danger, perhaps the feelings are gonna be stronger. We felt it. Would a police officer? Yeah, sure. Police corruption cannot exist.. ...unless it is at least tolerated at higher levels in the department. Merely uncovering widespread patterns of corruption will not resolve the problem. Basic changes in attitude and approach are vital. The policeman's first obligation is to be responsive to the needs of the community he serves. Frank testified before the Knapp Commission.. ...and he became famous. Very, very... very famous. I first learned of Frank Serpico from colleagues of my husband's. Uh, he began telling us about this fantastic cop in the Bronx who was spilling the beans on all these bad guys. Peter Maas introduced me to Frank and it was astounding how real he was. It wasn't newspaper hype. The first thing we did was arrange for the book. It came to me, and I said. "We have to get this book." There was a deep human story here about this very interesting person. My own experience is many people feel this but they feel they're alone. I thought to myself, "Oh, my God. Everybody should read this." You didn't just print it for today and tomorrow. You printed it for all time. I knew about Serpico 'cause I read about him in the paper and then I read the book. First of all, I thought it was a terrific story. There hasn't been that many stories made about Italians like that 'cause he was such a rebel. The story really must be the star number one in any movie. Another example is "Serpico." I read, uh, ten page from, uh, new book Peter Maas. I decide to do it. Serpico. There were over a hundred parts over a hundred locations. Not a whole lotta money. And it's ostensibly a period picture.. ...in New York. I think we shot it in 37 days. Al worked every day. It was such an active physical film and also, the things that he was going through. The bad guys and the good guys wanted Serpico. They were gonna light him up. You know, the biggest thieves in the world. I was a teenager. I went to see it a bunch of times because I was interested in movies and I loved Al Pacino. He was a hippie, cop, undercover. It was a very like, mythical figure.. ...in the movie. It had a big influence on me. I went and I got my ear pierced. And then my mother, she said. "Did you pierce your ear?" and I said, "Yeah." Then she like, took the frying pan, bam! I was under the influence of Serpico. Where's my coat? Well, do you see a black leather jacket like the one Pacino wore in "Serpico?" 'Cause if you don't, you owe me $379. No, I'm not gonna testify. You'll have complete protection. Yeah, I've heard that one before I gotta put a dime in the meter. Sit down, Frank. I'm ready to blow my whistle here. Now, you gonna listen to this tape, or not? No, I am not. You're one of them, huh? A crooked cop! And here's the bad news. I don't need your fuckin' status report, Serpico. - Serpico. - Serpico. - Serpico. - You ever see "Serpico?" "Serpico" nominated for best performance by an actor this year. Al Pacino for "Serpico." You need people with integrity. Those kind of people inspire you. When you're 15-16 years old and you say, wow, this guy is, like he really, he went the distance. And he was a renegade and he was a rebel and he was Al Pacino and he was the real Frank Serpico. Playing a real character that exists y... you're never gonna be them. When I played Frank Serpico I'm not the way Frank Serpico really is. But at the same time, I've been inspired by watching his movements and... and he's made me feel like sometimes you look in the mirror and you think you're gonna see another person. So, one day, we go and they're doin' this scene. Where they flush this black man's face in the toilet. And I go, what? Why the.. I say, "Cut!" "Who said that?" "I did." "What're you doin'?" "What am I doin'? What are you doin'?" "I'm making a movie here!" I said, "I don't remember that scene." You been jerkin' me around, heh? He said, "Well, it happened in my life." "Oh. Well. "If you're makin' a movie about your life, "put it in there. But leave it the hell out of mine!" Where's the money? Sidney liked to do movies the way he wanted to. And all of a sudden, somebody says "Cut." And it isn't Sidney. We always made it a rule. You've seen the script, and there's really nothing you can help us with at this point. "Well, if you're makin' a movie about your life put it in there." We have to now let the actors do their work. "But leave it the hell out of mine!" You... you can stay, but you can't stay here. So they asked Frank to leave and they never wanted him back. I was working with John Avildsen. Very few people know John Avildsen was the director who was first to be directing the movie. He came with Norman Wexler. We worked on the script together. It was a beautiful day. I mean, we had snow. And I remember he just finished a script and we just go, "Wow. Wow, that's it!" You know, and, uh, John had on a shearling coat and a big beard and he rolls down the mountain and he's all covered with snow and he, he stands up and he says, "Ah! "I haven't felt this good since I was 14 years old!" And Norman Wexler looked at us like we were crazy 'cause I followed him down. Well, one day, my wall phone rings.. ...and it's John, and he says. "Frank, are you sitting down?" I said, "What?" And he said, "They let me go." I said, "What?" I think he was disappointed that Avildsen didn't get to direct it because Avildsen had such a passion about it. And Frank liked him so much. John Avildsen wanted me to play myself. You know, and I said, "What, are you crazy?" I said, "I'm not an actor." He says, "Just think of it. You'll be an eccentric." I said, "I already am an eccentric." I said, "I'm not an actor. I'm... I'm... I'm the real thing." He was Frank Serpico and then he became Frank Serpico that Al Pacino portrayed. And that had to be lived up to. And that becomes another stressor because when you walk into a room, everybody saw your life. He's hung his hat on identifying himself as Frank Serpico, the guy who exposed corruption. But he's trapped then by that. Frank Serpico is not that guy. That's something that he did but that's not really who he is. And that will continue to plague him. You see.. ...once I'd left the police department, I just.. Believe me never gave anything.. ...about the old days a thought. I mean, you did write a chapter about Frank in your book. It's hard for me to imagine that you never thought about this particular incident especially 'cause Frank had the movie and the book and then became, like, this kind of icon. When I saw the movie.. ...I got angry 'cause it gave the impression that he got shot and we just sat there and did nothin'. I think Peter Maas.. ...was tryin' to use the shooting as a... um.. In other words, people were out to get you and they finally succeeded and one had nothing to do with the other. Uh, how do you feel? My, uh, idea was to show the overall picture. You know, I'm in the hospital and there was a uniformed cop who wanted to visit me and the cop who was supposed to be guarding me says, "Don't go in there. He's no good." This is not Narcotics or the guys I'm workin' with. This is the whole system. They must've felt guilty of doin' somethin' otherwise they wouldn't have been so challenged by what this one guy was doin'. That's possible. You know any... anything is possible. Ramsey? What the hell's goin' on here? What is this, some kind of a setup or somethin'? Paco! Hey, you got older. What happened to ya? Oh, me? I haven't got a gray hair on my head. You've gotten taller. Yeah, I've been, uh, stretching, uh.. ...sleepin' on the ground. You've gotten shorter. That's what it is. Yeah. I'm afraid that's true. - Closer to the ground. - Is Rhonda here? Wanted to see ya. No, she left about 11:00. She waited to see ya. You recognize this guy? Do you think they did an accurate, uh? What's it say, here? "A police officer's first obligation "is to be responsible to the needs of the community he serves." You know that guy? Nobody knows that guy. The man that came to my aide when I was shot he was a civilian. He was the guy that called the police. The cops didn't call 'em. I'm lying there, bleeding to death and... some civilian called. They can't isolate themselves because if they do, it's gonna be a police state. And, uh, police have to understand that. They.. You can't have a free society any other way. Can you? No. And they keep saying, us against them. You know, and we can't have that. There's only us. The reality is that the story that came out on top.. ...was not that of... power or institutions but, uh, the truth. The story that came out on top is Paco's story.. ...'cause that's what everybody believes. "Ramsey, who stood at my side with love, admiration and respect." "Paco Francisco.. "...Serpico." I always admired Frank for what he did. He exposed a system that I was very much against but I never would've done what he did because most of us just went along. Everybody knew there was a lot of corruption in the police department. That was part of the reason why everybody distrusted police. To see him as somebody fighting that.. ...I was very proud to be his neighbor at... at that point. I'm a big fan of his. If there was more people like him it'd be a different world. I've taken guns and knives out of people's hands.. ...but I didn't have the courage or I wouldn't have the courage to do what he did. Unfortunately, you know, he's been vilified and he'll always probably will be vilified as a, what you call, a rat. You know, so, he really wasn't a rat because rats are people who give up other people. He was never a... an... an informer. He was a, uh.. I'm trying to find the right word. He was an exposer. He does look, in retrospect like something out of a Western movie. He's like, "The Man With No Name" or something like that. But, of course, that wasn't his idea at all. He just saw corruption going on around him and... and took a stand. I think it's crucial to reclaim the parts of our past that we don't know about. The taking back of stories that's very important. And especially from people that at the time, some people consider them heroes and some people demonize them. People have to see other people that have taken actions that made change in order to understand how to make change themselves. I think this is maybe the most important aspect of Serpico's story. It's a extraordinarily powerful moral beacon. You say to yourself, you know, "What can I do? You know, uh, one person?" But occasionally, every once in a while someone like a Serpico shows up and... and reminds us. I told myself, eh.. "Frank, you're goin' on stage tonight." I told myself I was an actor. "Of all the days, that was the one "an age of reason could have begun. "Well, force has not prevailed! "And think if he had recanted. "It would have been as if night had fallen again "just after the sun rose. "But everything has been changed today. "So much is gained "when only one person stands up.. ...and says no." But he disappeared very quickly after that. I think he told us he was going. I actually think he may have said "I'm gonna go away." You know, "I can't stay here anymore." We visited Paco, as his friends call him earlier this month during a gray and chilly week at his farm in northern Holland. The past is the past. I just think it's a pity that I didn't feel then like I feel now. If you see a policeman takin' a payoff all you have to say is, "Hey, you're under arrest." And not feel, "Well, I'm gonna be the outsider now and, uh, nobody is, uh, going to accept me." Um, you become a prisoner of yourself. That's, uh, that's how I felt I was then. I was, uh, my own, uh, I was a prisoner of myself. For almost ten years, the real Serpico has had to compete with the images, the burden of living with a myth. The exile's life is relatively empty. Friends are few and far away. In their place, Serpico has made a meticulous routine of housekeeping and animal husbandry. He says it works. There's nothing wrong with being by yourself if you're at peace because then you're at peace with your whole environment with the whole universe and, you're not lonely. One day, I heard a scream. Some little girl had fallen in the canal. I got her out. And a crowd started forming. And I thought, "Gotta get out of here. The cops are comin'." Next morning, two detectives come to my door.. And I said, "Shit." Alright, here goes Holland. They drive me to headquarters and they take me up, up, up to the commissioner's office. And we walk in and he snaps to and he comes forward and he puts out his hand then he says.. And I look on his desk and there's a copy of "Serpico." And he asks me to autograph it for him. And he said, "I'd like to show your movie to all the brass." I go there, they show the movie, and I said. "Well, gentlemen, ladies, what'd you think?" "I can't believe that a police officer would do such a thing." And I says, "That's good. "But it's also bad.. ...because if you don't believe it.." I said, "Gentlemen, it will happen." And a year later, my phone rings.. ...he says, "You were right. It happened." There was a big scandal.. Narcotics. Frank Serpico's life is full of ironies. He gave his career and much of his body to an ideal of serving his New York community. Now he lives cut-off from his American past ever the man outside. People don't know who Serpico was and they still don't. Uh, and for a time, I didn't. And now I know who I am I know what I am. And, uh, anti-corruption label, uh.. Then people think, "Ah, call Serpico. Dial the Lone Ranger." That's all part of that fantasy where you call up the good guy and he takes care of everything. Take care of it yourself. I thought, "I can't keep fighting this." "That's not what I became a police officer for." I remember even the chief sayin' "What're you gonna do with the rest of your life?" It's like there's no life after the New York City Police Department. I said, "What am I gonna do? I'm gonna live." I had just come back from Europe and I called John up. And he said, "Hey, I'm building a house in Sagaponack and, uh, why don't you go hang out there?" And the next thing I know I sort of became the chief cook and bottle washer. Inside this innocent-looking house.. ...strange things.. ...are going on. He'd been hanging around Sag Harbor I'd met him when I was 19. I really knew very little about him when I first met him. Really kind of fell in love with him for the first time we spent together. You know, there's some kind of deep-rooted humanity there. We had a lotta fun. Paco can make going to buy groceries kinda fun. I'm sure glad we got this on tape, folks. Keep it up. John had all this camera stuff around and, uh, we were always doin' costumes. Now get to the personal stuff. In Italy, the country where I come from there was a farmer and his son who wanted to make a lot of money. And so he says, "Come to America" but he's get a job as a shoeshine boy. You make hay while the sun shines. You understand? So now I'm trying to get my life together here. He did not leave a broken man. He embraced life. Now, were there certain voids in his life? Everybody has voids in their life. But I don't think you're gonna get a much more colorful elaborate or sensational life than Frank Serpico. It got to a point where it felt like he needed his own house. And he had this land up in upstate New York. And... so, we went up there in the camper. We camped on the land and we kind of went. "Okay, that looks like a good place over there." He built his cabin in the woods. If you wanna lose the present then live in the past. But this moment is gonna be gone forever. Tonight, they're paid to protect and serve. But these cops were breaking and entering shaking down dealers, and doing drugs. They're the new breed of corrupt cop brazenly defying the law and the top brass. You're under arrest. And the cop who blew the whistle 20 years ago, tonight, Frank Serpico breaks his long silence outraged, that little has changed. Get on the ground! Get on the ground! This police brutality thing's coming more and more into the news today. And we will have Daryl Gates, former chief of police of Los Angeles, and Frank Serpico who's the, uh, the Serpico. I hope that police officers in the future will not experience the same frustration and anxiety that I was subjected to.. More than a quarter century later. Frank Serpico was still reading from the same page. Certainly, uh, that force which is reasonable and necessary can be used and it's part of doing the job... We're talkin' about a bathroom here. Why do you need excessive force in a bathroom? - Let's get real. - Serpico, you're... you.. You got a loud mouth, Serpico. - Would you just listen for a moment? - At least it's honest! This was part of my opening statement over 25 years ago. Unfortunately that hope was never realized. Back then there was widely tolerated systemic corruption. It'd be a shame if somebody gave the impression that that was the case today. We have to light the lamps that shed the light on corruption, injustice and abuse of power. Move! Move! Move! "Never has there been a greater need "for lamplighters than today. "We must hold our lawmakers accountable "or democracy and freedom of speech in America will soon become extinct." From the vantage point of more than 40 years observing the police, Serpico says. "There's still a long way to go." Some officers think "I am the law." No, you're not the law. You are sworn to enforce that law on all, equally. Nothing has changed. The abuse has been switched around. But, the abuse of power is still there. This has sort of been my healing place. This is what I call my Zendo. See anything look familiar here? That's the bottom of a nightstick. Nice sound, huh? I remember bein' invited to a program where cops were honored from all over the country. I got invited to be a presenter. I said, "Congratulations. Uh, you got the nation's ten top cop award." When I went to shake their hands each one of 'em gave me a big hug. And they each whispered something in my ear. And what they whispered was.. "I gotta talk to ya."
