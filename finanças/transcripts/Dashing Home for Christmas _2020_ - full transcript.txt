[CEO] Now this is exactly what I was looking for Alex. Now you get home and see your family. Don't stay too late. Okay? Mr. Williams. If you would just take a look at the numbers here, we have put together an extensive report... - Call me Roger. - Roger... I mean, I'm just not sure. This is a lot to take in. Well, you'll see we've actually interviewed thirty-seven employees both here and at various regional offices. We have analyzed their workflow systems, processes. And we've identified areas where there are inefficiencies and/or redundancies. You should actually see the recommendations on page 12. Oh. I don't know. [WHISPERING TO BRYAN] I'm never gonna make it. Ah! [CLEARS HIS THROAT] Why don't you take some time over the holidays to think about what we've proposed. I know that these decisions are never easy to make. Oh. Well, I was hoping to take care of this before the holidays so it's not looming over me at the start of the year. But perhaps you're right. I agree. Yeah, you know, sometimes all you need is just a little bit of time to put things into perspective. All right. Let's regroup at the start of the year. Thanks again for all your help and suggestions. - Thank you. - You're most welcome. Have the best holiday! I've made it to the airport in less time before. I like my chances. I have faith in you, but you're cutting it pretty close. I once made it from a meeting in mid-town Manhattan to my seat on the plane in less than 30 minutes. Yeah, but it wasn't Christmas. And don't forget. We owe the boss man our proposal for Bieldtech as soon as we're back. You know me. I will work on it on the plane. Now go. Go enjoy your holiday. Oh and tell your wife I said Merry Christmas! [EMILY] Hey. I just finished my meeting and am rushing to get to the airport. I'm pretty sure I can make it. Are you still going to pick me up? Of course. I can't wait to see you! It looks beautiful. Where are you? [GRACE] I stopped by mom and dad's to borrow from mom's gigantic collection of Christmas gift bags from years past. Who is that? [MOM] Is that Emily? I'm making your favorite cookies right now. You hear that? Yes, it's Em. [DAD] Tell her we say hi, and can't wait to see her. Are they taking good care of you? Very. I'm barely allowed to set the table. And I will not miss the birth, okay? I would not miss it for the world. Thank you. I know how much that means to you. And you're okay coming alone this year? Yeah, it's fine. It's been ten months since we broke up. Plus this will give me more time to focus on you, mom and dad. Yeah, I really miss you guys. Well then get home! [GRACE] We can't wait to see you! Great! The weather's getting worse. Uh. But I'm going to have to let you go because my rideshare will be here in... Whoa, ah... Before you can say two turtle doves! I gotta go. [GRACE] Okay. See you soon! Oh. I am... I am so sorry! Ah... Here. Here you go. Merry Christmas. Oh, hi. Excuse me! Can I please get through. That's my car! That's my car! No! No. Oh no no no no. No no no no no. Watch out! I am so sorry! Are you okay? Yeah. - Let's get you up. - 'Kay. Oh no no no no no. Oh, I'm never gonna make it in time for my flight. I feel absolutely terrible about that. This is my car here. I'm heading to the airport right now. Give you a lift? It's the least I could do. Ah. Yes. That's really kind of you. I really appreciate it. - I'm Simon. - Oh. Emily. [EMILY] Thanks again. I'm sorry if I was a little bit short with you earlier. It's just, it's been a long day, and I'm running late for my flight. Oh. No problem at all. I'm actually cutting it pretty close myself. Where you headed? I was in a meeting today I thought would never end! But I'm in sales, so I couldn't just tell the client, "I got a flight to catch!" That would be just be... Yeah. Um, it's all about the sale, though, right? So, ah, what do you do? Huh? I said, "What do you do?" Sorry. I'm just trying to update my family. I am so sorry. I have a tendency just to talk people's ears off. I'm a people person. Always asking questions. Did you say something? Oh, no. You do what you got to do. No. It's just work. This late before the holiday, huh? Yeah. They expect you to be on 24/7. But if I get what I need done now, then I can just relax when I get to my parents. Well, fair enough. So, how's your day? [EMILY] Thanks again for the ride. You are a life-saver. Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas. Oh, wait. Let me help you with your bag... [DOOR SLAMS SHUT] You've been selected for an additional security check. Is this your bag? Did you pack it yourself? You've got to be kidding me. Okay. I'm sorry. I know that this is your job but my flight is boarding. And I really need to get home, so if... You and everyone else. Ooh. Okay. Okay, I'm just going to... Nope! It's a Christmas morning family tradition. Am I good to go? Merry Christmas! You just made it. We were about to close the door. Oh, I'm sorry miss. Because you weren't here twenty minutes prior to boarding, we gave away your seat. Seriously? I'm here now. Is there anything you can do? Well, I can't get you back your bulkhead seat, but I might have something for you... In the Exit Row. Is that okay? Is there nothing you can do? Miss... Monroe. Miss Monroe. I'm actually one of your "Elite" members, so... We truly appreciate your business, but unfortunately with it being the holidays, and everybody trying to get home, well the best I can do is an exit seat. Yeah, okay. I appreciate it. I guess the most important thing is getting home, right? What a small world! Emily, right? Oh! Right. I'm so sorry, I feel awful, but I forgot your name. Simon. Oh, right, Simon. Right. Simon. Is everything okay? I guess so. They gave away my original seat because I was stuck at security. So now I have a middle seat. Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. You know what, though. I have an aisle seat. Just one second Miss. No no no no no. I couldn't. No. It's fine. If I hadn't gotten in your way on the street... I insist. That's really kind of you. Thank you. - There you go. - Thank you. Merry Christmas. Enjoy your flight. - Merry Christmas. - Thank you. I appreciate it. Well, at least let me buy you a drink on the plane. I will send it over. Umm. Deal! [PILOT] Merry Christmas folks. This is your captain speaking. That Polar Vortex is putting some weather in our path. So all Seattle flights are being diverted to Butte, Montana. Let's hope the weather clears soon and we can get you all to your final destination. Hey. Yeah. Do you mind? Aisle? Middle? Middle is great. Well, better safe than sorry, right? It's not the first time it's happened. And it certainly won't be the last time. I'm sure the weather's going to clear up. So I can't even count how many flights it's been for me this year. I've seen every single in-flight movie there is. I'm not joking. [TAPPING] Oh, gee. I am sorry. I've been chatting your ear off this whole time, and I've never even asked about you. What you working on? Oh, just spreadsheets. I'm a management consultant. I'm actually working on a proposal for a client right now. Ah, ah. And you're heading home to see your family for the holidays? Yeah, like you, I'm constantly on the road. So getting to spend the holidays with my family means everything to me. Oh. That's really sweet. And I know what you mean. I think this is like day 15 or 16 for me on this trip. I honestly lost track by now. That's a really long time. Explains the luggage. Oh, yeah. Hilarious. How many days for you? Eight. Yeah. Half the time I don't even know what city I'm in. I know what you mean. This one time I was coming back to my hotel after a long meeting and I completely forgot what room I was in. I had to down to the front desk and ask the clerk. It was... Yikes. So let me guess. You are a Prace Hotels "Elite" member? How did you know? Oh, it was just a lucky guess. But based on your job and sort of how you are, it made sense. And plus for me, it's part of my job to know how to read people so I can sell to them. Well, that's pretty impressive. And I bet... Actually, I'm really sorry. I don't mean to be rude, but it's been a long day. And I would just love it if I just now put in my headphones and just listen to a little music. And try and get this done. Of course, yeah. I'm sorry about that. As a fellow road warrior, I totally get it. Great. Thank you. [SHOUTS] What happened? Oh. I am, I'm so sorry. I seem to have this effect on women. No, I just had the weirdest dream. Or maybe it was a nightmare. I don't know. You're all good. It's going to be smooth sailing from here. [GATE AGENT] Attention passengers on flight 645 to Seattle. We thought we were gonna be able to get you all home tonight, but I've just been told there's now a ground stop in effect which means it looks like there won't be another flight out tonight. So, what are you gonna do with this unexpected night in the middle of nowhere? Well to be honest, I just want to get to a hotel, take a nice long shower, and just pray that I will get on the first flight out tomorrow. Oh. From your lips. Oh and Simon, it's was a pleasure to meet you. If I don't see you again, I hope you have a great holiday. Merry Christmas. Hey folks. Let me give you a hand with that. Are you following me? Oh hey. I'm just kidding, but I knew you were a Prace Hotel person. Yeah. They're usually the closest to the airport so... You know, it's too bad we're only here overnight. I heard this is a really fun town with a great barbecue spot. You like barbecue, right? You always see the positive in every situation, huh? To be honest, I just want a hot shower and my bed. Oh, ah... Do you need help with your bags? No, I'll be okay. But thanks! Hi. Reservations under Nichols, first name Emily. Of course Miss Nichols. We have you all set for one night. I just need your ID and a credit card for any incidental charges. Yes, just a moment. No, no, no, no no. Please no. Not right now. Is there a problem? I can't seem to find my wallet. I don't have it. Is there any way... Oh, actually I have my loyalty card stored in the app. So will that work? I am sorry Miss. Without an ID and credit card, I'm afraid I can't check you in. And with the storm outside, we have a lot of people needing rooms, and this is the last one, so I'll need to release it. But I need that room! Again, I am sorry miss, but I will need you to step aside. Good evening... Jamie. How are you this evening? Better now. How can I help you? Well, wouldn't you know it, with this crazy storm outside my flight has been canceled. Don't have a room for the night. Just wondering if you could help me out? This might be your lucky day. It seems a room just opened up! And it's a really nice upgrade from our regular rooms. Would you look at that? I feel like Santa Claus tonight. I can even give it to you for the regular rate. Merry Christmas! But, that's my room! I'm sorry miss, I had to release it. I'm confused. I must of left my wallet at the airport when I had to go through the extra security. And now they won't give me my room without my credit card and ID! There's nothing you can do to help this lady out? I'm sorry sir. If she doesn't have a credit card and ID... I can actually vouch for her. You know, I know that she's top, Elite status. I really wish I could help her, sir, but it's company policy. Well, I mean, I have a credit card. Would you like to split the room? Oh, I couldn't do that. What, are you gonna sleep on the floor of the airport? You're a life-saver. I will send you the money I owe you right now. Really. Let's not worry right now about that. We're both very tired and we'll get a good night's rest. And we can sort this out later. Here we are. And, oh. Congratulations. Huh? Why? Thank you. Oh. I just assumed. Sugar-Plum! This is... This is so nice. Hmmm. Honey. Do you have some cash? But there's only one bed! Well, it is our honeymoon. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. I got the couch. I couldn't let you. You're the one who got us the room after all. Listen, I'm not going to make you sleep on the couch. I feel bad, though. Look, my mother raised me right, Emily. If she had any idea that I made you sleep on the couch, she would kill me. - Are you sure? - Yes, I'm sure. Okay. Thanks. And thank you to your mother. Do you need to use the bathroom before I get in there? I just have a nightly routine that might take a little while. Ah, yeah. That would be great. Just one sec. Okay. Thanks! Hey. So you're in the Honeymoon Suite with a hot guy? I'm waiting for the bad part. You're the one who's always complaining that you never meet anyone. Maybe this is the universe sending you a sign. [EMILY] The guy, he's handsome, but that's not the point. He talked my ear off at the airport. And the rideshare. And the shuttle... Is he married? Single? How would I know that? You didn't look for a ring? Why would I do that? Please, when I was single and saw a cute guy, that was the first thing I looked for. You need to take more of an interest in people, Em. Oh, I think he's coming. Okay. Check his ring finger! Also, I need a pic or it didn't happen. Um. I'm gonna try and get on the very first flight out tomorrow morning. As soon as I have the flight info, I'll text you. Okay? Bye! Okay! Bye! All right. It's all yours. What's that smile for? What? Nothing. Nothing. I just, ah, really excited to shower. Oh. Okay. I'm calling the front desk. It doesn't look like we have hot water here. Oh my goodness. I am so sorry! I didn't mean to... I thought you'd be longer in the shower. I couldn't resist. What's that about the front desk? Never mind. It's fine. [LAUGHS] What's so funny? I'm glad you're comfortable enough to be like this around me. What? The robe, or...? Oh, ah... Well, ah, actually. The plane air, it kind of dries you out, so I find that this helps make the skin a little hydrated. So you should try it. It's good. We all have our little rituals. I like to do a hundred push-ups and two hundred crunches before I go to bed. Yeah. I see. It's working. I don't know about you, but I see treats, and I'm starving. Do you want some? It's on me! Ah, well yeah, sure. But technically I put my credit card down so it's on me. Sorry. You've been so kind to me, when I've been a little bit... Stand-offish? [CHUCKLES] I'm kidding. Well, maybe. Just a little bit. It's been a long and stressful day. It's totally understandable. [SIMON] Oh! So much deliciousness. No contest. Definitely the chocolate. Great minds think alike. Oh wow. Nice presentation. It's called respect. I like that you like all my favorite things. I think it's actually you who likes my favorite things. - Cheers. - Cheers. [SIMON] Hey did I hear your phone ring earlier? Maybe that was TSA with your wallet? Oh, yeah. I'm tried to get through to the TSA, but I could only leave them a voicemail. So, I'm going to try them again tomorrow. Well, I'm sure it will turn up. Being on the road all the time, things are bound to go wrong. I mean, you can either be upset about it, or you can just go with it. You never know what might the situation might bring. Are you always so upbeat about everything? Maybe you're right. You know what? Let's start over. I'm Emily. Emily. Hi, I'm Simon. Nice to meet you. So what are your plans for the holiday? Well, I'm an only child. And my parents passed away. So I usually just spend it with old college buddies. We have a very tight-knit group. In previous years we've done Vegas, New Orleans, San Francisco. Sorry to hear about your parents, but your friends, they sound fun. I mean, family comes in all different forms. [EMILY'S PHONE RINGS] Hey. Maybe it's TSA. They've got your wallet. That would be amazing if they found it. [CAMERA CLICKS] It's just work. You know what, I need to learn how to take a break once in a while. So... Here we go. Well, it's definitely important to have some balance in your life. Yeah. And don't get me wrong, I do love my job, but with all the travel, it gets to be a little lonely at times. Yeah. [EMILY'S PHONE BUZZES] Sorry. Flame Emoji 100 emoji Heart-Eyes emoji Is that your boyfriend? Boyfriend? Oh, I just assumed you had someone waiting for you the way you answer your phone smiling. Texting all the time. No no. I wish. Most of my relationships only last a few months. I mean, they always start out really great, but then I have to go away for a few weeks, and then when I get back, it feels like we have to start all over again. And you know what? Most guys just, they can't seem to handle that. You know, so that is just a long-winded way of saying, that if you see me smiling, I'm probably talking to my sister. Yeah, she's about to give birth to her first child and I wouldn't miss it for anything in the world. So... What about you? I mean, I noticed that you don't have a wedding ring, which means you're not married. When did you notice that? Oh, ah. I wasn't looking for it on purpose or anything. I just happened to notice it at some point. Um, so. Anyway, you are evading my question. I'm just wondering if you have someone special waiting for you? If there was, I wouldn't be going away with my buddies. I had a girlfriend a while ago, and when I got back from my old job, I was home all the time, I don't know, something wasn't just clicking anymore. Yeah. Sorry to hear that. Now, I don't know what's worse, being on the road or being at home? I would like to think that with the right person it wouldn't matter. So, here's to all the fellow road warriors. May we find that special someone who finally understands our crazy crazy life. Here here. Okay, now that smile is definitely not for your sister. What? Was I was smiling? Anyway, I'm actually going to probably call it a night. I'm super tired. And we got to get up super early, so. Right. And let's hope this weather clears so we can finally get out of here. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Ah, good night. - Good night. You know, I'm actually not too tired. Do you mind if I... Oh yeah yeah yeah. By all means. The light's not bugging you? No, it's okay. Good night. Good. Good night. [SIMON CHUCKLES] [SIMON LAUGHS OUT LOUD] I'm sorry. I'll be quiet. Okay. Great. Good night. [LAUGHS] Okay, I am really sorry. I said I would be quiet and now I'm not being quiet. It's just this book is hilarious. Is this okay? Sometimes it's the only way I can sleep. Oh, yeah yeah. For sure. Do it. You need to. [SOUNDS OF WAVES AND BIRDS] Great. [SNORING] Organized all my stuff! Put the shaving cream next to the razor, toothbrush next to the toothpaste. Why did I not think of that? Hey - having contractions. This might be it! Hey. What are you doing? My sister is in labor and I told her I'd be there. So. Well, what are you going to do? I don't know. I guess go to the airport and figure it out. Well, let me come with you. Really, it's okay. I'll be fine. I'll be fine. So much for our honeymoon. Well, Simon. Thank you for everything that you've done. If you would just tell me how much I owe you I'll pay you right now. Are you trying to score my digits? That's really smooth. No, I just thought I'd pay you back. I am kidding. Great. Let me know how much I owe you and I'll pay you immediately. Okay. I will let you know the final cost when I check out. Fine. I guess this is goodbye then. So, ah, goodbye. Safe travels. And I hope I don't see you at the airport. Huh? I mean, I hope you catch an early flight so you make it home in time to see your sister. Oh, right. Yeah. I hope I don't see you either. Okay. [QUIETLY] Bye. Oh thank goodness. Whoa whoa whoa. Hold on there. I'm not even set up yet. Just give me a moment. Of course. Yeah. I'm sorry about that. Now. How can I help you? Okay, you would not believe the night I've had. I just need to... Oh, I hear you. I'm about to get hundreds of people just like you. Yeah, I understand that you have to re-book a lot of people... Oh honey. No one's getting re-booked. Did you see the ice out there? I did. I'm not sure any planes are leaving here today. And the ones that do will be packed. Well, I actually need to get home. So if you could just... I understand. And I'm trying to help you. But if you want to get home today, I suggest renting a car. And I would get on that now before I tell the hundreds of other passengers the same thing. I appreciate it. Yeah. Thank you. And Happy Holidays! [PHONE BUZZES] False alarm. Still at home. But might be coming soon. Get home as soon as you can! [BELL RINGS LOUDLY] Hi! I'd like to rent a car please. One way. Getting an early start, I see. Well, I was told all the flights are pretty much grounded and I need to get home today. All right. Miss? Nichols. Emily Nichols. And I actually have the loyalty card on the app. Oh, okay. Well, firstly thank you for being such a loyal "Elite" member. And secondly I think you're in luck. It looks like I can get you into one of our last cars. It's a compact, but it sure beats out the 15 person passenger van, which is the only other vehicle I have. I'll take it! Whatever it takes to get me home. That is, the compact car, not the passenger van. Although if I had to, I'd even take that. Great. Just a driver's license and a major credit card. Hmmm. Right. Ah, Mr Rental Car Agent, is it? Spencer. Spencer, ah Spencer. Here's the situation. I lost my wallet yesterday. Yeah, with my ID and credit card. And I'm still waiting for the TSA to let me know if they have it. And on top of that, all the flights are grounded. So, Spencer... You are my only hope to get me home for Christmas. So, can you help me out Spenceroo? I would really love to help out. Even without a credit card, as an "Elite" member we can figure that out. If you didn't have your license physically here, I could make it work if you knew the number. The problem is, I can't let you drive the car without a driver's license. So... I can rent you a car. You just have to have somebody with a valid driver's license to drive it for you. Okay. Okay. Simon! Simon! Simon! Come here! - Me? - Yeah yeah! Come here! What's up? Spencer. This is Simon. He will be my driver! Ah! Hold on one second. What? What? I'm doing you a favor. All the flights are either grounded or booked. And Spencer here has one last car left, well that and a van fit for a soccer team. Oh, so now you need me, huh? Well, how else are you going to see your friends tonight, huh? So win-win, right? I will let you listen to whatever you want on the radio. - Whatever I want? - Yes. - Deal. - Deal! Deal! Did you see those people at the rental counter when they said they had no more cars? - We got lucky. - Yeah. Lucky. Lucky is right. And I just mapped out the trip. Looks like we have a little more than eight hours to go. Hopefully get you home in time before your sister goes into labor... Again. That would be amazing. You're a lifesaver. Again. So are you ready to hear my holiday playlist? I'm ready! ♪ [LOUD METAL MUSIC] [SHOUTING] I can tell you like my taste in music. [SHOUTING] No. It's fine. That was the deal. [MUSIC OFF]I'm, I'm just kidding with you. I know it's not everyone's cup of tea. I do have a killer playlist. I can compromise though. Radio? Yeah. Maybe we can just listen to the news, you know? Hear about the weather and the road conditions. Would that be okay? Yeah, sure. [EMILY'S PHONE BUZZES] [GRACE] Hey you. Sorry about the false alarm. Did you get a flight this morning? Sadly no. Everything was booked or grounded. So we're driving. We? Yes. I'm with Simon. He's my designated driver because I don't have my license. Simon? Is that the guy? Well done, Em! Hi Emily's sister! Oh, and he sounds as cute as he looks! Stop it! Anyway, I should get to mom and dad's later tonight. Well, everyone is excited to see you! Any more contractions? Don't worry. I'm crossing my legs to make sure you're here for it. I'll be there, I promise. She'll be there! [SING-SONGY] Emily's got a boyfriend. I'm hanging up. Don't make me regret coming home! [SIMON] I have no idea how you can do that while driving. That would make me car sick. Years of practice. Actually I have my laptop tethered to my phone so that I can access the internet or check my emails. It's like my own little mobile office. Oh, and I actually canceled all my credit cards and I reported a lost item request to the TSA for my wallet. So. Also, are you hot in here? I feel like I'm in a sauna. Seriously? I'm wearing my coat. It's freezing! I love how easy it is to rile you up. Oh... you're terrible. Good thing we're not a couple because we are totally incompatible. Were you thinking what it might be like if we were dating? No! [SCOFFS] You wish. All right. Let's compromise. I'll turn down the heat a bit and, in exchange. You can have this lovely scarf. - Deal? - Deal. Oh. This is so soft. You may never get this back. Oh, you're gonna want to see this. I've driven through here before plenty of times and I just, I just love this view. It's beautiful. Before I used to just drive by, never noticing. Yeah, it's, it's breathtaking. I mean, I'm always trying to get to the next place as fast as possible. I don't think I've ever actually stopped to take a look at the view. Well you're missing out then. You gotta appreciate the little things in life. [CAMERA CLICKS] It's gorgeous. Thank You. Sincerely. You want to grab a selfie, you know, to remember the moment. It's not just the place, but the people you're with, right? Okay. On three say "Simon was right! Emily was wrong!" Cheese! Don't push your luck. Can I see? You got to keep that! Yes. - Thanks again. - It's okay. Really. [STOMACH GRUMBLES] Oh ah... I don't know what that was! No need to apologize. I know a great spot just down the road that serves a killer all-day breakfast. Can we please go? Table for two? Sit down anywhere that's open. I know this looks like just like a regular roadside diner, but all the food here is super good. The eggs and veggies and meat come from the farms surrounding the area. It all sounds so good. - Coffee? - Oh, yes please. - Thank you. - You're welcome. You folks ready to order? Um. Yeah, I'll get the Holiday classic please. Ah! It's really good. Elf's honor. And you miss? There are so many choices. Um... Usually I would just get some yogurt and fruit, but, ah... What do you recommend? The breakfast sandwich is really good. Poached eggs over breakfast sausage, with peppers and onions, a slice of melted cheese, served on sourdough toast. Sounds delicious. I'll take it. Oh, ah, can I make a few substitutions? Uh huh. Firstly, I would love it if I could get it with egg whites only... and I don't love peppers and onions, so maybe instead a slice of avocado? And could I get turkey bacon instead of the sausage, and if you have it, I would love it if you could place it all on a croissant instead of the sourdough. That would be amazing. Ahem. Looks like you have a new breakfast sandwich on the menu. And Stacy, is it? Does that come with anything like home fries? Because I would love to get it with regular french fries. They're my only vice, but only only when they are crispy and hot. So when they're coming out could you just please make make sure that they are piping hot? Like sizzling. Oh, I'll make sure they're hot all right. What? I like fries. A woman after my own heart. Tell me you like watching sports, and I'll just have to marry you. Just the fries. I can't believe you're a secret Rom-Com fan. I can't say I agree with your all time favorite, but you show promise. What can I say. I am a hopeless romantic, Emily. - Really? - Yeah. You? I've dated a few women who they say they want a sensitive guy, and when I am, they don't want to believe it. Well, ah... That's not what I meant. I just... I guess, you surprise me. In a good way. [EMILY'S PHONE BUZZES] Work again? Yeah. How did you know? You just get this cute crinkle in your nose when you get a work email. Oh. I do? Yeah, it makes sense though. I've just been so busy this past year that I've missed a bunch of things with my family. So this was my attempt to make up for it. - Coffee? - Yeah. Thanks. Thank you so much for joining us. I'll take that when you're ready. [EMILY] I'll get it. With what exactly? You going to go washing dishes? That's right. Sorry. That's all right. I'll put it on your tab. Okay. That's for you. Keep the change. Thanks again. Thank you so much! You're lucky to have such a great husband. Be sure to hold on to him. - Merry Christmas! - Merry Christmas. How did I end up with such a nice husband? I want to say it was coercion. But I could be wrong. You seem to really have an effect on everyone you meet. I guess I'm just more matter of fact with people. More transactional. Oh. I guess the way I see it, every day has infinite possibilities. There are literally countless people you see on a daily basis, walking by, in a coffee shop, in the elevator. It's kind of cool who you might meet, what kind impact they could have on your life. I mean, hey, look at us. Should we go? So. Next stop, home! Yeah. I still can't get over how good that breakfast was. Yeah. Those fries! The fries! They were insane. Who would have thought to fry them in clarified butter? Mind blown. Oh, actually, um... I kind of have a little bit of a confession to make. I secretly love Christmas music. Don't judge me. You? I love Christmas music! I can't believe you didn't say something earlier. I don't know. I guess I was just a little embarrassed. I didn't know how you would react since I haven't exactly been in the Christmas mood lately. Oh please! I can't trust anybody who doesn't like Christmas music. Right! I mean, what is wrong with those people?

Okay. Okay. What was that? I'm pretty sure we just popped a tire. I'm going to pull over. No. No no no no no. Please. [EMILY KNOCKS ON WINDOW] [EMILY] Anything? It's bad news. Looks like we blew a tire. Are you serious? Please tell me you have the rental agreement in the car? There's got to be a number for roadside assistance in there. Pop the trunk. What? Pop the trunk. What are you doing? What does it look like? [TOOLS JANGLING] You know how to do that? You don't? My dad taught me because he wanted to make sure that I was never stranded. So. Do you mind just loosening the lugnuts? The lug-whats? Are you serious? In order to put a spare on and take the bum tire off, we need to loosen the lugnuts. I actually like it when you say lugnuts. Wait wait wait. Stop. When you loosen it, you want to make sure that you put it back in a star pattern. See. Like this. Come on. Got it? [SIMON] I got it. I got it. There. You know the Roadside Assistance people are never usually this helpful but I kind of like it. Pick up the phone. Pick up the... Oh! I have signal! Okay, there is a train station about 20 miles away. We can make that. I will just call and see if they can just pick-up the rental car at the station. Okay. I'm just going to go check at the counter, get us some tickets. Sounds good. [PHONE RINGS] Dad? Hey Em! Is everything all right? Your sister says you're with some strange guy? It's fine. He's harmless. I mean he can't even change a tire! He already sounds better than your last boyfriend. [LAUGHS] Okay. You still think you'll make it by tonight? I hope so! We had a little bit of an issue with the rental car, but we're going to catch a train instead. [SIMON] I got good news and bad news. [BACKING UP BEEPS] Dad. I have to go but I will call you as soon as we get a better sense of when we'll get there. I need good news. So that first. Good news is, there definitely is a train that's going to get us home in time for the holidays! That's great! What's the bad news? The bad news is, the train only runs once a day, and we kind of just missed it. Oh. Great. Should we just chance it with the rental car then? Who would have thought they would have taken the car this quickly? We're stuck here. Kinda. Until tomorrow. But there's a motel right there across the street. I say we grab a great night's sleep, catch the train first thing in the morning, and you'll be home just in time for Christmas Eve dinner! I appreciate your enthusiasm. Really I do, but I was trying to be better this year. Okay, I had planned to arrive early and spend quality time with my family, but as always, I will be there at the last minute. That is if everything goes right! And so far, we haven't had the best of luck! So. Well, I'm not the salesman I thought I was. Good news number 2. The guy at the ticket counter gave me a voucher for the motel room, so yay for us! Yay... Too much? Yeah, too much. All right. Come on. Okay. We'll get you home tomorrow in time for Christmas Eve! Yeah. Please don't jinx it! Hopefully this is the last little hiccup in our trip. I think we've hit the misfortune limit. Yeah. Let's hope! Okay, well. See you tomorrow, bright and early. Yeah.

You there? Simon? Simon? [SIMON] Hey. Hey! Hey. Nice scarf. Oh, sorry, I completely forgot. Do you want it back? Oh no no no. You hang onto it. I know how cold you can get. Did you need something? Or do you just miss me? What? No. I was just, ah, I was just wanting to come and see when the train was leaving tomorrow. I know you told me, but I forgot. Ah. I think it's around 10 am. Cool. Cool. It's just because it's once a day and I wanted to make sure. I don't want to miss it again, or anything. What's with the cups? Oh, I wanted to see if you wanted some. Aw, thanks. So. Where were you? Oh, I was actually coming to knock on your door. What you missed me? I was actually just wondering if you wanted to find some snacks on that cute little main street we past on the way in. I am starving and the vending machine back there is quite sad. I was wondering if you are hungry too? I am. Yeah, I am. Thanks! I just think, we've been so cooped up, you know, in the car and the hotel rooms. It would just be nice to get some fresh air. Sounds like a great idea. Yeah. I'll just grab my jacket quick. Okay. [EMILY] I don't remember the last time I did something like this. It's kind of nice. What? Took a walk? Well, no, I do walk. I just mean being somewhere with nothing to do. I've been so busy, I've barely even registered it's Christmas. I'm always running from an airport to a hotel to an office. Here, I just have no control over the situation, you know, so it's kind of nice. Well, it's a great way to decompress before you see your family. Yeah, I guess. I mean, being with my family it just reminds me when life was simple, you know. When I was kid a snowball fight would just make me so happy. Don't you dare! I'm not going to do it. Just calm down. And plus I saw your snow angel the first time we met, and it was not so graceful. Very funny. Are you done with your hot chocolate? Uh, yeah. I'll be right back. Okay. What do you have there? You're going to have to pick a hand. Left! Your favorite, Sauvignon Blanc! Great. Oh, what's in the other hand? Oh just snacks and sandwiches. The guy from the store said it would pair best with the wine. Everything is closed for the holiday, so this is our little feast. Oh! And... There's one more thing. To get you in the Holiday spirit! May I? Yeah, okay. I've already missed so much so... This kind of helps. Well. Shall we? What's that in your hand? I was just wondering if I still had the knack. Hey there's a patio at the hotel we could use for our Christmas feast. You're right. We do have a patio! Yeah I didn't realize it either. It's not the Ritz, but it'll do. It's actually perfect. And on such a beautiful night. M'lady. May I interest you in a bottle of our finest French wine? Mais oui! Oh Emily. Was that supposed to be French? It sounded a little Australian to me! Stop it! I'm trying. D'accord Mademoiselle. Would you like to smell the bottle cap? No way! That's my favorite line from... [TOGETHER] The Muppet Movie! And then Steve Martin with the eye patch! - It's a classic. - Oh, it's so good. Okay fine. Maybe you do have good taste in movies! I am so sorry! I think maybe with the eyepatch my perception would have been better! It's totally fine! I'm just going to clean up real quick so that it doesn't get sticky. You can use my patio door, it's closer, if you want. - Okay. Thanks. - Okay. Smooth move Simon. Wow, you're pulling out all the stops, huh? Yeah, I just figured if it's our last night together it should be special, right? Yeah. Let's just hope it's our last night together! Oh, thanks. No! That's not, that's not what I meant. I mean... I'm really enjoying my time with you. It's just, ah, I'd also really like to get home. You make it way too easy. I'm just teasing again. Cheers!

The GF wants me to come home with her and meet the family! So won't be able to meet up! Sorry for late notice, but hope you understand! Have a great holiday! [EMILY] What? You okay? Yeah, yeah. It's just my buddy can't make it this year. He's going with his girlfriend to meet her parents. I'm sorry. That's too bad. He'll miss the "big guys weekend". Yeah. All my buddies are dropping like flies. I mean, I'm very happy for them, but pretty soon I'll be the last man standing. Yeah. It's a big step, though, meeting the family. My family, they always grill the guys I bring home. Rightly so. I don't always have the best judgment in guys. I mean, they're always just so perfect on paper, but then in real life... You know what? I'm pretty beat. Oh, what time is it? Oh wow. How did it get to be so late? We've been out here for hours. But it's been really nice. Yeah, I agree. It's been a perfect way to spend the evening. Our long nightmare is finally coming to an end. Nightmare. Gee, thanks. I was just beginning to think we were having fun! Oh, no no no. I didn't mean it like that, I was just... Sucker! What? You're one of those guys who can dish but they can't take it? Well on that note, I'm going to call it a night. Hey, I didn't actually really mean what I said. Just ignore me. I'm not sure I could do that if I tried. [EMILY'S PHONE BUZZES] Okay. Good night. I'll see you in the morning! All right. Hi! Are you coming home tomorrow? We have to finish decorating the tree and didn't want to do it without you! Awww. I know. I'm trying, trust me. We're going to be on a train tomorrow morning, so we should get there sometime in the afternoon, hopefully. And how is your boyfriend? He's not my boyfriend. I mean, he's not even... He's just a guy who's... Really great, actually. I thought he was kind of annoying? He is. Or he was. Or I don't know. I guess I can be a little too quick to judge sometimes. That doesn't sound like the sister I know. Very funny. The more time I spend with him, the more I see the complete person. Oh wait. I think someone else wants to talk to you. Hey Emily! We can't wait for you to come home! Hi Mom. Me too. We should get there sometime mid-day tomorrow. We? Oh, are you bringing the guy your sister says you're with? No! No. I didn't mean "we" as in "we" I meant "we" as in we're traveling together but we're separate. Maybe you should bring him. Can't be any worse than all the other ones you've brought home. I know I haven't always chosen winners, mom. Winners? Your's don't even make the podium. [LAUGHS] Oopps! [MAKES STATIC SOUND] Looks like we've lost the connection here. I can't hear you mom. Hello? Hello? Very funny. You know I'm kidding. I love you. I love you too. I'll see you tomorrow. Bye! Bye bye! Well seeing as it's Christmas Eve, I got you a little present. Oh? Two tickets home! Can you believe it? It's been two airports, two hotels, a rental car. And we're still hundreds of miles from where you have to be. But I'm determined to get you home on time. And I was beginning to think we were never going to make it. [ANNOUNCEMENT] Attention passengers on Platform 2, the inbound train is delayed and we hope to have a new departure time shortly. I know it was too good to be true. And to think that last part was going to be easy! Hey, this is just a minor delay. It happens on the best days. [CHUCKLES] [LAUGHS LOUDLY] I will be right back. Stay here. Sir, are you okay? Yeah. You know what? I'll be back in one quick sec. Stay there. I don't know where you found him, but don't lose him. Oh, he's not... Thanks. Here sir. [ANNOUNCEMENT] Attention please. For everyone waiting on Platform 2, we're sorry to inform you that your train is stuck at the previous station. There seems to be some sort of mechanical problem. They are working on it, but are not sure when it will be fixed. I don't know if I'm the bad luck or if you are! I'm pretty sure it's you. This literally has never happened to me when I travel alone. Excuse me no. I think it's you. Looks like your Knight in Shining Armor status is coming back. And it's rubbing off on me. Ah, well thank you. Holidays can be absolutely crazy so, I just figured he needed a hand. Right? Yeah. You like helping people, huh? It's not like a conscious thing. I'm just doing what anyone else in my position would do. Right? Yeah. Most people would not do what you just did. I guess I'm just being a good elf. Why don't you grab this one and I'll grab one a few rows back. Okay. Hi. Hi. Are you two together? No, well, we're traveling together, but we're not together together. It's a long story. Well, he's pretty cute. Did you want to sit together? Because if you don't, I may. No no no no no. I couldn't make you move. But thank you. Actually, you know what? That would be really nice of you. You got it. Merry Christmas. You too. Thanks. Excuse me miss. Is this seat taken? Very funny. Come on. You know, it's the strangest thing but the woman you were sitting next to just asked to switch seats with me. Something about you snoring. She said she wouldn't be able to put up with that for the next five hours. I figured since we've come this far together, we should just finish the journey together. So. [PATS THE SEAT] [SIMON] It's been quite the adventure. Hasn't it? It has. I know, I can't believe it's almost over. I mean, as much as it's been a total hassle and super super frustrating, it's been really nice getting to know you. You definitely made it way more fun than it would have been otherwise. I don't know if you noticed, but I can be a little type-A sometimes. And I don't love situations that I don't have control over. So... I would have never guessed. Stop it! Well, I have to say, despite our initial hiccups, you've actually been a great travel companion. What do you say we bring some life into this bus? What did you have in mind?

What about you when you just cracked at that high note? I literally have no idea what you're talking about. I have a voice of an angel. So, are you excited to see your friends? Have a big boys' weekend planned? Yeah, I'm excited. But, you know, for your own health and safety I would avoid going anywhere in the downtown area. Okay. Yeah. And how about you? Is your family picking you up from the station? No, I'm actually grabbing a rideshare. Do you want a ride somewhere? Oh no. I'm good. I'll be fine. Are you sure? It's not a problem. Honestly. It's okay. I'm sure you're probably super ready to get rid of me too. Mmmm... [EMILY'S PHONE BUZZES] Work? Yeah. It's just something from my boss. On Christmas Eve? Well, yeah. I think he used that as an excuse. "Merry Christmas. Oh, and by the way, when you get a chance, could you please send me Bryan's suggested headcount reductions for the client?" "Headcount reductions"? What's that all about? I'm a management consultant. I told you that. I thought you said that it was about strategy and efficiency, though? It is. We recommend everything possible to keep a company viable and in business for years. I mean, that is actually what creates jobs in the long run. - What? - Nothing. What just happened? Your energy just changed. You essentially fire people? No! I don't fire anyone. My boss suggests layoffs as a last resort. So you just, you just shrug? Oh well, these people are your 'last resort'? Of course not. I mean, I hate that it has to happen. But if we don't keep a company healthy, I mean, it can't really employ anyone, can it? Hey, I know it's awful. But it's not like it's personal. Maybe that's your problem, Emily. Nothing is ever personal to you. I mean, what if it was somebody in your family? These are people's lives we're talking about! Simon. Come on. Please just see the bigger picture. I can't believe you're being so nonchalant about this. Simon. Come on. We've had such a nice time until now. I mean, aside from the diverted flights, and the delayed train and the flat tire. It's been really nice. I just, I really thought I saw a different side to you. Someone who had room in her heart for more than just her family, but the people around her. Maybe even right in front of her. Simon. I'm really sorry. Okay. For what it's worth, I think you're amazing. And I know I wasn't super nice to you in the beginning, but, I've really grown to see what an incredible person you are. Oh. Thank you. So... So. I guess this is goodbye then. Yeah. It's been an experience. Yeah! That it has. Um. Thank you. Sincerely. You've been so kind and wonderful and helpful. I mean, if it wasn't for you, I'm don't think I would have made it home for Christmas. Well, you definitely made it more fun too. I mean, maybe not in the beginning, but you certainly grew on me. I grew on you? Yeah. I just wish I didn't learn that last bit. Simon. I really hope that you don't define me by my job. I mean, I just hate this note that we're leaving on. I was kind of starting to think that maybe... Well, yeah. Me too. I just... I think we're different people. Right? Yeah. Yeah you're right. Simon, I really hope that you know how sorry I am. I really wish that we could just pretend that the last ten minutes didn't happen. That would be, that would be really nice. Simon, I ah... You're really special. And I'm glad I got to know you. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Actually, do you want me to wait maybe until your friends get here? Oh, no no. Please. You've already missed two days with your family. Really I don't mind. Emily. Just, just please go. Okay. - Emily? - Yeah? I, ah, I forgot something. My scarf. Oh yeah. Yeah. Sorry. I completely forgot. Here you go. Thanks. And once I have a moment to tally everything up, I'll send you the bill. Uh huh. Yeah and I will make sure to send you the money as soon as you do. Did you need my number? No. I already had it from the first day. So, I guess we're... I guess we're good. Yeah. I guess so.

What happened? Well, I'm a consultant who sometimes has to recommend layoffs. Not exactly the most attractive career to someone as big hearted as Simon. That's not fair. Yeah, well. Neither is getting laid off. I actually said 'It's not personal.' I'm such a fool. Yuck. Any chance he might come around? It seemed like there was a real spark between the two of you. No? There was. Well, until... Did you get his number? Maybe you can call him later and smooth things over? Is that Emily? Is she on her way? Is she bringing the boy? [MOUTHS] No. It's bad. He has mine, you know, to invoice me for all the money I owe him. Yeah, but I know you are more than your job, and I'm sure he has seen that, too, so... What? Sooooo... What? Go back. Tell him how you feel. What! No! I'm just so close. Finally! I've already lost out on way way too much with you. No, Grace! Em, we'll still be here later. I was just so afraid of missing out on the most important day of your life. I know that you love me. And so do Mom and Dad. And so will my baby. But if you have feelings for Simon, you need to make sure he knows it too. I'm scared. Come on. Take a chance. Stop being that conservative consultant hiding behind your computer and spreadsheets and show him the warm and caring person that I know you are. I'm not sure I can do it. No. I can't do it. I can't do it. Do it. Do it. Do it. [ALL TOGETHER] Do it! Do it! Do it! Excuse me. Do you mind taking me back to the station? He's not here. He must have left. Ugh! Stupid idea. Simon? Emily? What are you doing here? Did you forget something? You could say that. Just stay there. I'll be down in a sec. Simon. What are you doing here? Where are all your friends? They're not coming. What do you mean? Truth is, they all have their own families now, and they just kind of do their own thing. But you said that... I know. I know. I just didn't want to sound like a loser. You know. I was supposed to meet my friend Paul, but he was the one who had to bail to his girlfriend's and I just... I am now the last man standing. What? So you were just going to spend Christmas Eve by yourself in a strange city? I'm just going to be alone tonight. Tomorrow I'm heading to the toy drive, handing out toys to the kids. And here, I thought you were just overpacked. But apparently you're Santa. I mean, on a much much smaller scale. A few of my buddies, we pick a different city every year and we just do what we can. Simon. I'm really sorry. For everything. I know how awful it is to lose a job. And I hate that part of my work hurts people. I know. And I'm really sorry, too. I shouldn't have never taken it out on you. It wasn't fair. So, ah, you want to come home with me for Christmas? That's not very nice. Simon. Simon, you got me home. And I mean, after everything we've been through, you're practically family. I just, I don't want to impose. I know how much you love spending time with your family. I can't. Simon, seriously! Christmas is about the gifts and the people in our lives. Whether we've known them for 30 hours or for 30 years. You taught me that. I can't believe it took me this long to realize it, but you are my Christmas gift this year. You sure your parents aren't going to mind some strange boy coming over? I'm sure. Trust me, you are a huge step up from all the other boyfriends that I bring home every year. Is that so? Well I guess in this scenario that would make me, you know, your boyfriend? Umm... Yeah. But don't believe any of the stories they tell you. They're all lies. - Welcome! - Hi. Welcome. Come in. [GRACE] You must be the famous Simon. Oh, I'm famous, am I? I may have mentioned you during the course of our misadventures. - Mr. Nichols. - Simon, welcome! Nice to meet you. [EMILY] You look beautiful. You made it! Oh! He's much more handsome than the picture you sent Grace. What? You took a picture of me? I hope you got my good side. Yeah, I did actually. That was delicious. Thank you, again. I'm so thankful to have my family all at home at the same time. [DAD] Here here. And I'm thankful for this delicious dinner. I'm so thankful for my loving husband. And we're both thankful for the baby who'll be in our lives any day now. And, um, I'm thankful for Simon because he got me home to see all of you. Simon? How about you? Oh, no. I thought this was like a family-only thing. If you're here, you're family. Um. Well, in that case, I just want to say to everyone, thank you, incredibly, you know, for letting me into your beautiful home. And having your delicious food, and you know, getting to spend the holidays with you guys. So this truly does mean a lot to me. And I just feel very blessed. So... Thank you. Cheers! Merry Christmas! Well, since I am part of the family now, and I certainly did not help an inch with dinner, I shall cleanup for you guys. So. That's the least I can do. [MOM] I like him more and more. Hey. Merry Christmas, Simon. Merry Christmas, Emily. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪
