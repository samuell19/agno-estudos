Welcome to Navojoa. Little brother. Jack. Weren't at your hotel, so I figured this'd be the next place to find you. Right, well, you could have waited for me to come and find you when I was ready to talk, but that's not your style, is it? I know this isn't something you wanted to do, coming here. On the contrary, this used to be one of the most incredible junkyards I ever saw. Now look at it... there's almost nothing left. You know what I meant. Ryan, I... - I meant... - I know what you meant. What kinda trouble you in? I'm all in. Whew... how much you need? You know, man, you don't have to throw it back in my face. I know you've bailed me out before... I know. I get it. That's not what I meant. Yeah. Listen, I just wanna help you get right. So if you need cash, I'll get some... No, it's not cash, it's not cash. Cash won't do this time. Well, then what is it? - Four ladies. - Oh! Diamonds are not a girl's best friend. How is it that you're such a fuck-up when your brother Jack is out there winning all the time? What is that like? You guys still close? Well, you're gonna need him. We need him. Need him for what? We need him to run the Outlaw. Davie, listen, man... it's out of the question. Look, I can... I will pay you back every last dollar that I owe you. I will. It's not about a choice. Actually, it is a choice... do I kill you now, or do I give you a chance to redeem yourself. Jack thinks as highly of me as you do. He will never race the Outlaw. Not even to save the life of his little brother? Man, there's no way. He won't do it. Are you willing to bet your life on this? There's a race, it's called the Outlaw. This year it's Mexico to L.A. God, you got some balls, man... some fucking balls, coming down here, asking me that. I retired, man. I got outta the race game, and I've stayed there. Yeah, you think I don't know that? Get your stuff. I'm driving you back to the States myself. I'm in a really bad place with this guy, man, a really bad place. He has people... people that will find me. I can't be looking over my shoulder for the rest of my life. Get in the car. It looks like I'm the oldest guy here by about at least 15 years, huh? At least you got experience on your side. Or I'm too stupid to know I shouldn't be here. Is that the guy? Good evening, racers. Welcome to this year's running of the Outlaw 1000. This year's race starts in Navojoa, and it's 1,000 miles to Los Angeles. The winner... $5 million. I don't care how you get there, but it has to be on four wheels, and there's three checkpoints that you must hit along the way. The checkpoints have been preprogrammed into your GPS systems. Is that all of them? Oh! Ladies and gentlemen, we have royalty in the house tonight... Mr. Jack Tyson. This motherfucker done won more races than any redneck in NASCAR. Did you point a gun at my brother? As a matter of fact, I did... and here you are. Jack, Jack, wait, wait, wait! Your brother owes me a lot of money. But if you win this race, the debt will be paid. Nelson, did you not explain? Yeah, I did. Come on. Come on! This is why you don't meet your heroes. Put a muzzle on that fucking dog! What were you trying to prove back there? Get your hands off of me. You can't mess around with a guy like Davie. Don't tell me you're afraid of a grown-ass man that goes by the name of "Davie." Shut the fuck up! Fuck you, man! Hey... what would have happened if I wouldn't have come down here, huh, Nelson? How would that have looked? You'd take a bullet from this asshole? Why? What do you want me to tell you, man? I kept losing, all right, and he was the only game in town. He saw you coming, man, and he gave you just enough rope. Guys like that? They can spot the real compulsive gamblers a mile away. Shut up, man. When are you gonna get it together, man? Seriously. What are you even still doing in Mexico? You had the money to get out. I didn't have it. You didn't have it? Is there a problem here? You know what? You could tell Davie to take it all and shove it right up his ass. Him and I, we're not done. Not even close. Ooh, charming, Jack. Why don't you take this anger and channel it into winning this race? Drivers ready! Nina! You about to find out about these eight seconds. Still not as quick as your boyfriend in bed, though. This ain't no rally race, homeboy. Three... two... Go! Jack is still one hell of a driver. Shame he's such a fucking prick. I bet it's killing you on the inside, not putting any money on him to win. Go to hell, Davie. I'll tell you what... I'll float you 100k. I mean, what kind of guy would I be to not let you get in on the action? All right. How come there's not much riding on Jack up there? Maybe they know something we don't know. Well, that's crap. What's with this hidden camera shit? Paranoid much? Why don't you just shut the fuck up and watch the race? Fucking Jack Tyson needle dick. Who the fuck is Jack Tyson? Yeah, where the fuck you at, Grandpa? Fuck. Let's go. Shit, oh, shit! Fucking Hot Wheel driver. Come on. I got you. No way, not today. Not today, come on, let's go. Welcome to checkpoint one. You are? Jack. So this is it, huh? Well, congratulations on first place for checkpoint one. Mr. Davie? I've got a Mr. Jack in the restaurant, first place. Si, senor, will do. He'd like to congratulate you on your first-place win. Ah. Yeah, sure. So Davie owns this place? Si, he's owned it for many years. For the winner. And once all the other drivers are here, lunch will be served, okay? Goddamn it, fuck. Hola, race fans, it's your girl, Six-Speed Nina, and I am here at El Tesoro Escondido, in the town of Hermosio. And it's our first stop in the Outlaw 1000. And you'd better believe I'll be chowing down on some bean burritos before our race moves to our next stop, Puerto Penasco. Can I ask you what the hell you're doing? Well, I'm posting to all my followers on Instagram. You know, checking in every stop of the way, letting them ride shotgun all the way to L.A. Or letting the cops know where we're going all the way to L.A. You don't wanna go around broadcasting where you're going unless you want to get pulled over and arrested. The Mexican police don't follow me. Well, they will be before long. Says here you retired... like three years ago. And the last time you won something was longer than that. So what's Davie inviting you for? Your guess is as good as mine. But when I buzzed you back there, you didn't know what to do, so you don't have any street reflexes whatsoever. But I guess that's the difference between racing on a closed track against a clock versus having another man in the next lane? Is that right? Let me guess... the real skill comes from doing 90 in a pedestrian zone and losing control and plowing into a family who's coming home from having ice cream? Is that how you hone your "street reflexes," bro? Watch your mouth, Grandpa. Easy, guys... easy. It's okay, kid. You know what, I was pretty stupid when I was your age, too. Yeah, when was that? Before the car was invented? Something like that. I'll see you out there. Sure... just not for long. Good luck, guys. Who's there? Can you show me that 10-second car now? Eat a dick, Nina. Whatever. Gotcha! Bitch! Ah! - Drive! Drive! Drive! - What's going on? Jack has really come through so far. Yeah, for you, but nobody else is betting on him. One point eight mil? Really? Man, you said it yourself... he's retired. Been outta the race game for a while. These other kids are hot in the circuit right now. They're street punks. They've got more recognition, recent popularity... things your brother does not have. Gillian, make the transfers to the winners. Alert the losers that stage two is starting. Okay. I'm gonna need your name, or you're gonna need to get out. Is that a threat? You don't know anything about me. Maybe I don't do well with threats. Maybe I'm about to stab you in the face and take this goddamn thing? Oh, yeah? All right. Just wanted to know who I was in the car with, that's all. Name's Bianca. Hello, Bianca. You mind telling me what happened back there? You wanna tell me who you are first? It's only polite. Now we're being polite. All right, fine... my name's Jack. Jack Tyson. Jack? You're the guy... oh, thank God. You know who I am? You're Davie's golden boy. This whole thing hinges on you. Oh, you don't know how happy I am right now to have found you so quickly. Wait, you've been looking for me? I need you to take me to L.A. I know I can get there with you driving. Davie's probably gonna try some messed-up stuff on the way up, but he can't afford to lose you. He won't do anything to you. Well, okay, hold on. You're gonna have to start from the beginning. What is this all about? These... I took them from his safe. Oh! Oh, no... No, no, no, no. Fuck. Fuck! Yeah? Davie? Davie, they took them. They're gone. Are you fucking serious? Yeah, but I tried to stop him, but he was too fast, and I... I'm really sorry! Look, you stupid bitch, you'd better fucking find it, right? - I fucked up, I know I... - Now! I don't know what to do, I'm sorry. Stupid fucking bitch! God-fucking-damn it! Who the hell is that? Bianca. Wait, you know this chick? So, we there yet? Not even close. We're about an hour out of Suaqui Grande, which, now that I think about it, is probably a good place for me to drop you off at a bus station or somewhere. What? No, you can't! Please... Listen to me, I'm gonna drop you off at a bus or train station. You'll be safer and you'll get to where you're going a lot quicker and easier than with me, all right? He's looking for me at the bus station, and the airport. His men are everywhere, he's gonna kill me! Don't you understand that? Because of what's on those drives? What's on 'em? - Evidence. - Evidence of what? Of all of Davie's past, present, and future crimes. Evidence that's gonna get that bastard out of our lives for good, and put him away where he belongs. Listen, what exactly are on those drives? All of his ledgers... every record he's kept, dating back since he started keeping them digitally. Oh, boy. Did they get anything? As a matter of fact, they did. Was it anything important? Shut the fuck up, Nelson. They arrived at the checkpoint, the safe was broken into. Hey... you know why you're a worthless, piece of shit loser? Because you never win at anything. Sit down when I'm talking to you! You can call it luck; I call it karma. You come from shit, all you can be is shit. But when you give a shit, you get shit. My father was nothing, but look at me. Now I'm a multimillionaire who can kill anybody at any time. I own this town, I own the cops, I own everything you fucking see. Man, you don't own the cops. If they knew you were cutting them out of the race, you'd be fucked. Your brother, he's a piece of shit because you share the same fucking blood. Your father was a piece of shit. And well... Your mother was a stupid bitch for fucking a piece of shit. Look at you... the way you dress, the way that... everything about you says shit. You'll always be a fucking loser. I'm not here by choice. No one who does anything for Davie is by choice. Once they have their hooks in, you can't get out, no matter what you do. Sounds like you're talking from experience. You know, you don't look much like a thief or a safe-cracker. So tell me something... how'd you know where the drives were? I used to work for Davie. I was his girlfriend. I knew the safe code. Ah... girlfriend. Now, that's just fan-fucking-tastic. Oh, boy... let me guess, you broke up with him, he wanted you back, you stole the drives, and now everything's up in the air. Davie's gonna kill me if I don't deliver those drives to Los Angeles. He could kill anybody without a thought. I could never kill anybody... couldn't even think about that. You ever kill anybody, huh? I didn't think so. He's sick. This is payback. And look, whatever Davie has on you, whatever reason he has for forcing you to race for him, it all goes away once I get this evidence to the U.S. attorney. We can put Davie away for good, you and me. We can do this. No one else will do it, Jack. I underestimated this little bitch. She chose Jack because she knows I need him to win. I don't understand. She's trying to get over the border with the things she stole from me. She thinks Jack is her ticket. She's so fucking wrong. What did this chick steal from you? Shut the fuck up. Policia! I'll take care of this. The fuck do you want, banging on my door like the fucking police? Senor Davie... Vamanos! Vamos! Motherfuckers! - Yeah... - You done fucked up! Your whole family's gonna die behind this shit! - David! - Gillian! Damn it! Did they just arrest Davie? Those sons-of-bitches aren't taking him to any jail. Bastards! They pick today to do this, of all days. It's their mistake, their error. And this stays quiet. As far as anybody knows, Davie is still right here. Oh, it's Gillian. Gillian, what up? Garcia took Davie. I need you to bring him back. All right, understood. I'm sending the car, be ready. We're ready, we're ready. - What's up? - La policia took Davie. Let's go. Fuck! Get ready to fuck some shit up. Here we go. All right. Come on, come on, come on. Mick, you ass! Woo! Just a little bumpin', dumplin'! Not in this lifetime, Nita! Woo! Shit! Thank you, Jack! Motherfucking fuck, fuck! How do you like that, you little snotty prick? Jesus, did you just hit that guy on purpose? Now we're on track. That's how we do it. Are we really going 118 miles per hour? Yeah, that's the point of racing... to go really, really fast. Well, if you're trying to scare the crap outta me, it's working. Hola. Dos tacos, por favor. Très tacos y una cerveza. Que? Those tacos aren't coming, sweetie. You're gonna take us to him if you wanna keep your fucking head, do you understand me? Let's go. Why are we stopping? Because I need something to eat. You should do the same. We'll take it to go. We gotta make that next checkpoint by morning. How many stops we have until we get to L.A.? Two more checkpoints to the finish line. Hola, I will have the cemita milanesa y una Coca-Cola. Huevos rancheros, salsa picante. Breakfast for dinner kinda gal, huh? Since I was a little girl. But when you grew up poor like we were, the concept of breakfast for dinner goes out the window. You either eat what's in front of you, or you go hungry. Fair enough. Plus I just really like huevos rancheros. And you think that's the best thing to take in a car on the go? Don't worry, I'm not gonna get any yolk or salsa on your precious little car. Okay, so listen... let's say your whole plan works when you get to L.A. You said Davie has people everywhere. What makes you think he's not gonna come after you after he goes down? The U.S. attorney's giving me a new identity. Witness protection? And everything you have leads the feds to his front door? Yes. So you can stop trying to dump me on the side of the road. So that's what you meant when you said everything hinges on me. Oh, yeah... you're very important to both of us. I need you to help me get this information to L.A. He needs you to win to keep the criminals and cartels he works for happy and earning millions of commissions. He won't go after you. I gotta run to the bathroom. I'll meet you at the car. Yeah, hurry up. We gotta go. Hola, mija. We're gonna have some fun! Ah! Gimme the drives! I know that you have them! How about this? No! No! Ah! [ shouting Thanks for the drive, you son of a bitch. Puta bitch! Jack, we gotta go! Bianca, what the hell... Get in the fucking car! You okay? Is anything broken? I don't think so. Oh, man. He was looking for the thumb drives... these. Here, put this on your lip, it'll help with the swelling. Thanks. Ow! Son of a bitch had his knee digging into my back, I thought he was gonna break it. I'll be fine. It's nothing compared to what Davie used to do to me. It's not my car, it's your boyfriend's. What the hell did I say about saying that, Jack? What are you doing? How did he know you were here, huh? He can see in the car? Gotcha. Damn it! I think he got you. We have... a complication. Let's go, puto. Get the fuck over there. Por favor, no! Por favor! - Por favor! - Shut up. Thanks for the directions, papi. Get down! I said, get down, now! Come on, Davie... can you walk? Okay, you're almost there. Fucking pig! Motherfucker. I gotcha. They must have drugged him. Take his hood off. Move! Tanya, did you find him yet? Yeah, yeah, we got him, we got him. How bad did they hurt him? No, I don't... I don't fucking know, Gillian. You call me as soon as he's able to talk to me, you hear me? I want you to meet me in L.A. - L.A.? - Get to the air strip. The jet's waiting. Drive as fast as you can, you got it? I cannot risk anything else happening to him. - Faster, faster. - I can't go any fucking faster! Fuck! You don't belong here. Mm. Morning. Yeah. Did you get some sleep? A bit. I stopped for a couple hours when my eyes got heavy. Good. How far are we from the next checkpoint? I gotta pee. Close. I just hope it's a place where there's coffee. What is this? The Sinaloa. Cartel. Davie moves a lot of money for them. I want the girl! Send her out, and you go. Jack, please. Send out that puta, esse! - Bianca... - Send out that bitch! Get out. Jack, no... please. I said get out, now! They're gonna murder me, you know that, right? - Now! - Get out, now! My blood is gonna be on your hands, you son of a bitch. Now! Go get her! Go! Get in, get in! Jesus! Motherfucker! Fuck! You couldn't warn me first? Woo... 2.6 miles to go! You better believe I'm taking this one. Fuck you, Jack! Jack better be fixing to reach this checkpoint, Nelson. If he loses a stage, there's no good news for you. Don't threaten me, Gillian. "Don't threaten me, Gillian?" You know, for an old military grunt, you're a real pussy. "Don't threaten me, Gillian." Okay. Mick is about to win this stage, and now you're going to grow a pair with me? If I were Jack, I'd have turned my back on your pathetic ass years ago. Now look where you got him... out there on the road because you're a low-life degenerate with a gambling problem. Got a lot of balls for somebody who owes us seven figures. What are you gonna do? I mean, you gonna kill me? How's that get you paid? That gets us paid. Jack gets us paid. If he loses, so do you. If we have to pay out, we're not the only ones who are going to feel it. Killing you is a consolation prize, and we'd be doing everybody around you a goddamn favor. Jack, what are you doing? Get back in the car! Why are we stopping? Jack! - Bianca, please... - Jack! Please, stop. Gimme a fucking second, I've gotta check for damage. And relax, they're not after us anymore. You saved my ass back there. No one's ever done anything like that for me before. I'm sorry I didn't warn you sooner. I figured the only way they were gonna buy it is if you thought I was giving you up. I sure as hell thought you were gonna give me up. And then you mowed him down. Thank you. Sure. You know, come to think of it, Davie said all of the GPS systems were preprogrammed with the destinations of the checkpoints. That's how he's been tracking us. That's how he led us into that ambush. Now what? We don't know where the next checkpoints are located. I have an idea. Do you have Instagram? - Yeah. - I figured. Uh, look up Six-Speed Nina. If I recall correctly, she said something about Puerto Poco or Puerto Puntasca or something like that. I got it... Puerto Penasco? Yeah, yeah, that sounds right. Got it. Hola, race fans, it's your girl, Six-Speed Nina, and I am here at El Tesoro Escondido, in the town of Hermosio, our first stop in the Outlaw 1000. And you'd better believe I'll be chowing down on some bean burritos before the race moves to Puerto Penasco. I knew she wouldn't let us down. All right, come on, let's go. Woo! Where's everybody at? Did I win this motherfucking round? I think I did. Whew. Hey, yo, I'm here. So? And you are? Mick Hammett. And it looks like I'm the first motherfucker to show up. Well, congratu-fucking-lations. Are you sure it's safe to check in? Davie won't risk doing anything to us in front of the other drivers. What do you want from me, dude? Don't you got somebody you gotta call or something? I want you to call who you're supposed to call. - Uh, perdona me... - Yes? Jack Tyson, checking in for the Outlaw? Welcome, Mr. Tyson. You're the stage winner. I am? Whoa, whoa, no, the fuck he's not. I was here before he was! You were just talking to me before he pulled up! Man, I don't know who you are or what the fuck you want from me, but you just come in here talking about "I've arrived." Look, man, he's right. He won fair and square. I was here before he got here, you were just... Man, back the fuck up, dude, right now, all right? You got five seconds. That's right, man. Yeah... keep walking, man. Hello? Yeah, this is Robert. Got your first winner. Mr. Tyson. That's some major bullshit. Well? He did it... two more to go. Wait... That's why Davie gave me the 100k? What? Yeah, you needed some action on Jack so that no one asked any questions. You need this to look legit. I don't follow. You know, I might look like a brain-dead meathead, but even a kid really could figure this out. Yeah, the bettors, they aren't taking Jack because they're losing on purpose. Yeah... you and Davie retain the cash that they lose on the bet at a commission, and then what? My guess is you're supposed to spend it, or move it to where they tell you to. In the end, no one loses a dime on the wager, and you make, what, 18 million on stage two? This is money-laundering. Yeah. This whole thing is just a front. You figure that out by yourself? How about that? You know, at the end of the day, you and Davie are just two lowlife degenerates like me. I am nothing like you. I am a businesswoman, earning a living... a rather lucrative one, I might add. Until Jack gets to L.A. Well, it looks like you're gonna have to wait a little longer before that cup of coffee. So, you won, right? Well, as you can see, there was a little controversy, but yeah, I guess we took the stage. "We?" You're in the car, too... whether I like it or not. So which is it? Still deciding. Should we let the others know what we found in the car? They have every right to their privacy. Hey, yo, Six. Mr. World Champ. Hey, I wanna thank you for yesterday. You know, helping me out back there when Mick was trying to run me off the road. No problem. Let's just say he had it coming. Yeah, okay. Well, I'll tell you, he was super pissed. Then after what happened in the station... I'd watch your back. He's stupid, but I don't think he has it in him. Heh... yeah. Well, I just wanted to give you a head's up on what's going down. - Well, I appreciate that. - Mm-hmm. - Well, now it's my turn. - Yeah? You think you can grab Mick and meet me back here in about five minutes? I gotta tell you guys something. - Okay. - See you here in five. Yeah. You say a fucking word, and I will kill you. Who's calling? Hi, Jack. You don't know me, so let me introduce myself. I'm Gillian Bertrand. I guess "attaboy" is in order first... two stages so far. Gotta hand it to you. Why are you calling me? Where's my brother? Relax, nobody's lying in a ditch face-down with the back of their head blown off. All right, I'm listening. What do you want? The same thing Davie wants. We got a good thing going, all of us. Then why are you calling me and not him? I need you to focus, Jack. Don't let that bitch screw this up. She's just another one of Davie's crazy ex-girlfriends with an anger management problem. If Davie likes making deals, well, you can tell him I got one for him. Bianca for my brother... even trade. We never hear from either one of you again... debt paid. Are you there? Oh, I'm here, Jack, and I think I could speak for him when I say we're ready to agree to your terms... even trade. He's not coming. Oh... his loss. Listen, we're all being watched. There's cameras in the car. Wh... what? - Yeah, come... - But how? Come on. Look, check the dash and up above, you should find... What? What in the hell? Yeah. Wait... how did you know this? Nina, some things are better left unanswered. Do you want some advice? Get out of the race game, and you'll avoid guys like Davie. One of these days you're gonna realize it's... it's not worth the risk anymore. Jack! Jack, behind you, watch out! Mick, stop, let him go! Yeah, two of them, right now, they're fighting in the middle of my gas station. Are we done? Are we done? You all right? - You're hurt. - Yeah. Come on, we gotta go. Here, keep this on there to stop the bleeding. What's wrong? I have a daughter. She's six years old. Her name is Sophia. And where is she while you're here? Somewhere safe. I'm not gonna say where, I never know who's listening. Does she know how brave her mother is for doing this? Every waking moment should be spent with her, but she needs me to do this. The feds are gonna help her. I give them what they want, they help me get her into the United States, give us new lives, and give her the medical procedure that she needs. Pemex Gas. Roberto, is there anybody still there? Yeah, one of them's still here... the one that lost. Let me talk to him. All right, hold on. Yo, loser... you got a phone call, man. Hurry the fuck up, dude. What's up? Mick? This is Gillian Bertrand. I heard you two got into it earlier, and I see now Jack has left you behind. Yeah, I'm gonna catch up to that motherfucker and make him pay. See that you do. And make sure you win the next stage... whatever it takes. My brother and I are moving a whole lot of money to your ride. And Mick... don't make us regret putting our faith in you. Consider it done. Hurry the fuck up. What the fuck you doing, dude? Here's your phone, pussy. Jack? We have a problem. Yeah? What's that? I don't have a visa or a permit. The U.S. attorney's office didn't send you anything? I couldn't let them know I was coming, I couldn't risk Davie knowing what I was doing. Oh, God. All right, great, so how do we cross the border? You got any great ideas? Yes, but it's very dangerous. Ah, because of course it is, and why would it be any other way? We need to go back around where we came from, 20 miles. Mm. Wait... wait, what's happening? What did you do? What is your problem? First you're bitching that no one's betting on your brother. Now he's won two stages and everybody wants a piece of the action, and that's no good either? Make up your mind. No, you... no, you don't want Jack's bets to win, all right? You'd have to pay out big. Look at the size of these wagers coming in. That's more than the commission you made on the entire race. This stinks. What did you do? Gillian... Gillian... please, Gillian. Please, please. Get out of this office, before I blow your fucking head off. Okay. I'm tired of you. - Now! - Okay! If we die, I'm blaming you. Is that who I think it is? There's another car following us. Here we go. Whew. It's that asshole from the gas station again. Ah! Here's the border, it's right there! Can you hit that button and make us go faster? Yeah, nitrous in desert terrain... recipe for disaster. Crack the axle, the car is dead. Get him! Get him, damn it! Ah! Mick, you worthless piece of... Jack cannot win this stage! Oh! Oh! That's a big payout. "More than you made on commissions this far." They're in Arizona. How's your day going? It's fucked. So tell me about it... what's really going on? Man... man, I've dealt with some people in my life, but this bitch, she's something else, you know? Ah... a real chinga tu madre, eh? Ah, si. - Hit me. - All right. In that case, drink up. Mm, cheers. You gonna get that? No fucking way. I watched you ignore my call. Seems like a dick move, don't you think? Look, Gillian, I'm just having a drink, okay? - Get up. - Come on. Get up and out! - All right, all right... - Now! You don't have to do this. - Now, Nelson. - It is what it is, man. Welcome to Navojoa. - Oh... - Leave it... Consider it your tip. - Thank you, boss. - Move it! What are you doing, Gillian? It's time to meet up with your brother. I hope you're not afraid of flying. Jack, you okay? Jack, help! Tell me what's going on, Jack. I don't know. I'm... Where am I? Hey, we're okay. We made it. We're gonna be fine. What can I do? Remember you asked me if I ever killed anybody? Well, the answer is yes. What happened? It was a blind corner. We both saw it, but I... I miscalculated, and... I drove us off the side. The car landed upside-down, the fuel tank exploded, and the car burned up from the outside. I... I made it out, but my wife, she... she got trapped. It's not your fault. Growing up, it was just me and my brother. But he got screwed up in the war, you know, PTSD. All I had was my skin, my car, and the streets. You know, I had this '74 Camaro, ran like a beast. It was an eight-second car. I lived my life a quarter of a mile at a time. You know, they say you're only as good as your last race, and when my wife died, I was done. I'm so sorry, Jack. It's funny, because growing up, all I wanted to do is be the best, the fastest. Some people would say I was. But I never felt that way. When my foot hits that pedal and I hit top gear... I feel free. There's no better feeling in the world. See all the cars behind me, look in front of me... nobody. But as soon as the race was over, I'd be right back to where I started... waiting for the flags to wave. I knew I had to get out, do something different. But I'll tell you, Bianca, I feel like I'm pushing my luck. No. We're gonna make it to Los Angeles... for your brother, for my daughter. Look at me. Look at me. You saved my life. We're gonna get through this, I promise. You ready? All right, let's go. Gillian? I want to make an arrangement with you. Forget everything that Davie wanted. Forget about winning this race. I'll make it worth your while. Forget about winning the race? Yes, Jack... you give me no choice. You are coming near checkpoint three, and those other gearhead idiots are nowhere near you. What's it going to take for you to lose this race, huh? Five mil? Ten mil? What do you want? Talk to me! You know what, Gillian? Right now I'm currently driving, and I'm pretty sure it's against the law to drive and talk in the state of Arizona. Jack? Jack? Jack! Oh, you miserable bastard! We're getting close to checkpoint three, and she is freaking out. Good, nice to have them on that side of things for a change. When does Jack get here? Get him outta the car. Fuck you, Nelson. You motherfucker! - Fucker! - Oh, fuck you! - Shut up! - Fuck you! Fuck you! Shut up! Get... get down, motherfucker. Ha, ha, ha, Nelson! You fucking bitch. I want your brother to see you dead in the sand, esse. Oh, man... Just fucking do it! Fuck you! Oh! Come in! Jesus! You couldn't take that crap off of your head? She's six, for chrissake! Oh, you think she's pick you up out of a lineup? Ai... now I got to deal with this. Come here, come here... Hey there, little one, don't cry, okay? Everything's gonna be okay. You must be Sophia, huh? Would you get the hell out? Where's Mommy? We're going to see Mommy. Have you ever been on a helicopter before? What the hell is this? Don't stop, Jack, keep driving. Oh, my God, it's Nelson. Nelson? Nelson? It's okay, buddy. I got you, I got you. It's gonna be okay, buddy. I'm gonna get you to the hospital. - Don't talk. - I'm sorry! I'm sorry you had... you were stuck with me... - No. - ...for a brother. - No, man! - I'm sorry. No! No, Nelson! Jack... Davie. It's Gillian. I'm coming for you. No, not for me... for little Sophia. Mommy! Mommy? Where's Mommy? What is it? Mommy, are you there? Sophia! Baby, it's gonna be all right. Mommy! We're coming for you. Mommy? It's okay. It's okay! You listen to me. Shut up, Jack. You and that bitch meet me at the finish line downtown. You give me the thumb drives, I'll give you the kid. These are my terms. Help me get my brother. And grab that gun. Fuck, dude. Fuck! What the fuck, man? Shit, first fucking place. It's an ambush! Oh! You son of a bitch, come here. Sophia! Let her go! This is for my brother, you son of a bitch! Jack, stop, goddamn it, or she dies, too! Let the girl go and you and I will sort the rest out, you hear me? Give my brother the thumb drives, and let him go. Give me back my daughter! Gimme the drives, Bianca. Let the girl go and I'll let Davie here go... even trade. These are my terms, Jack! Give my brother the thumb drives and let him go. Don't hurt her, please! Please, don't hurt her! Where are the drives, Bianca? Give her back to me! If I was you, I would shut up real fast. Let her go! Drop the gun! Let go of the girl! Let go of the girl! Drop your weapon! Put your hands on the car! Sophia! Sophia! - Wait! - You'll see your daughter. Take her to the vehicle. Are you Six-Speed Nina? Yes. What the hell? I'll kill your whole fucking family, Jack. Jack, what are they gonna do? - Are you Bianca? - That's my daughter! That's what she's been telling us over and over again. Come here, honey. You can sit in here, up front. Mommy and Daddy can ride in back. It'll all be okay, just sit tight. - Hi, Mommy. - Hi, sweetie. Mommy, I wanna get out, I don't wanna be in any more cars. You and me both, kid.
