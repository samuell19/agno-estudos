William George Heirens. Lonnie David Franklin Jr. Albert Fish. Harvey Murray Glatman. Clifford Robert Olson Jr. James D'Angelo. Sheila LaBarre. Jeffrey Lionel Dahmer. Ordinary names but for serial killers, ordinary names are never good enough. We have to give them names that capture their dark souls, names that capture the evil they have become, capture the rare unthinkable. The Lipstick Killer. The Grim Sleeper. The Brooklyn Vampire. The Lonely Hearts Killer. The Beast of British Columbia. The Golden State Killer. The Avenging Angel. The Milwaukee Cannibal. - When we hear about somebody who moves from community to community, calculating who to kill next, which prostitute to get, these crimes shock the conscience because they are so out of the ordinary. They are so different from what, sadly, we've become quite used to. The more ordinary rape, the more ordinary assault, the more ordinary robbery, the more ordinary kidnapping. There are these crimes that just shock the conscience and so I fully understand why the public is preoccupied with them. I think they are so outside the box that we have this understandable need to try to grasp why would somebody do that? That's human nature. Why would somebody take a rifle, sit behind a barricade, and wait for innocent victims? Why would somebody do that? Why would somebody look for vulnerable children, kidnap them, torture them sexually, and kill them? It's hard for us to wrap our minds around these kinds of crimes. And it makes complete sense to me that the average human being would be both fascinated by this, horrified by this, mystified by this, and preoccupied by this. Why, why, why? - There's been a long-held belief in the public that serial killing is largely an American phenomenon, that America with its large faceless urban centers, street prostitution, poor and neglected inner cities, drug problems, and homelessness is not only a unique breeding ground for murdering psychopaths but has created a ready made victim pool for serial killers. Now we know serial killing has no boundaries nor time frames. - Serial killers have been active for 1,500 years, long before the United States was a country. According to my research now, about 63% of global serial murder is by Americans, United Kingdom is about 8%, Germany and France about 4%, and other nations also have large percentages. So it's inaccurate to say that serial murder is an American crime. It happened long before we were a country and even though there's a higher instance of the crime here that's reported, it may be that because of American police efficiency and the media, we know more about serial killers in America than other countries. So I think that these crimes in other countries are understated. Particularly in Latin America and Africa and Asia. - Often these early serial killers were associated with possession by mythological creatures such as vampires and werewolves. Peter Stumpp, a 16th century German farmer, accused of witchcraft and cannibalism, was also known as the Werewolf of Bedburg. The church made sense of his serial killing by saying he was an actual monster and tried him for it. - So Peter Stumpp did admit after being tortured that he had met the stranger in the woods and got a magic fur belt that then turned him into a wolf and then he had this ravenous appetites for tearing his victims apart and whatnot and eating parts of them. Apparently there's one story that he even ate the brain of his own son and that he committed incest with his daughter and so she ended up on trial with him. She also was tortured and executed as well as a wolf pack. But it was the thinking of the times in that sort of medieval area. And those kinds of trials played to what the church needed in its propaganda. I think he was a serial killer. But we don't know for sure if the things that he's said were true because if somebody's tortured into saying them, how much is that confession actually worth if you're told this is what we want you to say and you're tortured horribly to say it, usually you will. - Historically, women were just as bloodthirsty as the men. Reviled as the Blood Countess, Elizabeth BÃ¡thory was a Hungarian noblewoman whose serial murdering spanned two centuries, from the late 1500s to her death in 1614. Guinness World Records has labeled her the most prolific female murderer of all time, reportedly mutilating and killing up to 650 young girls. Of course, the most famous international serial killer doesn't come from medieval Europe but from Victorian England. The enigmatic Jack the Ripper. - Well, there's a few things about Jack the Ripper that I think made it become such a big deal. I think first of all you have a big city and so there's, with press and all of that attendant. You had the audacity of the crimes, which were often committed right on the street where people could walk by any moment. Multiple events in a single day. And then you had the fact that the killer sent letters to the press and got the press involved. I think those things, in addition to just the viciousness and brutality, made it the huge deal that it became. - In the mid-1800s, England experienced a rapid influx of poor Irish and Eastern European Jewish immigrants. This led to overcrowding and terrible working and housing conditions in London's East End and the civil parish of Whitechapel. Widespread poverty drove many women to prostitution. In October 1888, the police estimated that there were 1,200 prostitutes in Whitechapel and about 62 brothels. The economic problems in Whitechapel were accompanied by a steady rise in social tensions between the old Londoners and these newcomers. In April of 1888, police began investigating a series of murders and violent attacks on women. A series of brutal attacks that lasted until February of 1891. Known collectively as the Whitechapel Murders, there were 11 in all, of which five are universally accepted as the work of a single serial killer, called since those dark days only as Jack the Ripper. The Jack the Ripper killings began on Friday, August 31st, 1888 when police discovered the slashed body of Mary Ann Nichols. She was 43 years old. Nicknamed Polly, Mary Ann Nichols had fallen on hard times. She drank heavily, abandoned her family, and turned to prostitution in order to make enough money to pay for a room to sleep in. At 3:40 in the morning, London police stumbled upon Nichols' body. A maniac had sliced her throat and made deep gashes in her abdomen and womb. The police force and soon all London were agog with the brutality of the murder. A murder that went beyond simple killing, a murder of rage and lust. The only hope was that this would be the single act of a madman. That hope was dashed nine days later when the killer struck again. His victim this time was 47 year old Annie Chapman, also known as Dark Annie, a penniless prostitute. Annie Chapman roamed London's East End in Whitechapel, looking for the few shillings that would get her a room for the night. Early on the morning of September 8th, Annie was thrown out of her lodgings until she came up with the money to pay. A few hours later, she was discovered by police at 29 Hanbury Street, her throat slashed and her body mutilated the same as Mary Ann Nichols. Police had no idea who their killer was. They didn't even have a name for him until they received a letter about the murders bearing the signature Jack the Ripper. At last their serial killer had a name. All London was up in arms. Citizens banded together in vigilance groups, stalking the streets for this killer. Extra police officers patrolled through Whitechapel and London's East End, but their efforts were to no avail. On September 30th, Jack the Ripper struck with beastly cruelty and swiftness, killing twice in as many hours. The Ripper's first victim that foggy night was Elizabeth Stride. She had been born in Sweden in 1843. Tall and good natured, friends knew her as Long Liz. She was discovered near midnight in a yard at Berner Street. But her body was not mutilated like the others and there were doubts at first if she was part of the Ripper case. Then an hour later, police found the Ripper's fourth prey, Catherine Eddowes. She was 46 years old. Her body, found in Mitre Square in the city of London, was mutilated. Her womb and kidney eviscerated. There was no doubt that Catherine Eddowes was the Ripper's fourth murder. By now, the streets of Whitechapel were deserted. Prostitutes stayed indoors. No one dared venture out, especially certain women. The first four of Jack's victims had similar backgrounds. They were close in age, in their middle 40s. They had been married or lived in long term relationships. Three has children. All of them worked as prostitutes either for a living or occasionally. As a result, London police and citizens could see the work of Jack the Ripper, a serial killer of middle aged prostitutes. But Jack's last victim did not fit the profile. There were no murders in October and nerves started to settle. Women ventured out. Their customers came after them. Everyone thought that perhaps the Ripper had moved on or even stopped his vicious attacks. But there was one left. Mary Jane Kelly was a beautiful 24 year old Irish woman from county Limerick. She had been married but her husband died. They had no children. Young and good looking, when Mary turned to prostitution to pay her bills, she had no shortage of lovers who gave her extra money. But the long month of October had been hard with no work and Mary had bills to pay. At 10:45 on the morning of November 9th, her landlord's assistant stopped by the single room Mary rented at 13 Miller's Court to ask for rent. When he looked inside through the broken window, the gory scene that met his eyes was overwhelming. Mary's body had been brutally mutilated. Police hardened with the squalor of the East End had to turn away or walk out of the room. In fact, Mary's body was so badly mangled that her current lover, Joe Barnett, could only identify her by the color of her hair and eyes. After the slaying of Mary Kelly, Jack the Ripper mysteriously vanished. The police had as much information as the public and only a few tantalizing clues from the three letters they had received. Jack the Ripper was certainly not the first serial killer but he was the first to create a worldwide media frenzy. This was a time when newspapers had become the world's first mass media. The widespread cheap news of the day. The medium of sensationalism we know in the 21st century. In fact, it was the newsmen of London who popularized the killer's nickname, Jack the Ripper. From then on, every serial killer had an AKA, an Also Known As. The Boston Strangler. The Green River Killer. The Beltway Snipers, and so on. The legend of Jack the Ripper has lived on into the 21st century. Perhaps it's because the identity of the Ripper has never been revealed. Jack the Ripper was never caught. As a result, the case has lived on in popular culture in books and movies. The first and the best known was a novel written by Mrs. Belloc Lowndes, published in 1913. The Lodger is the story of a mysterious guest who takes a room in a London home. It is the perfect metaphor for the killer among us. So who was Jack the Ripper? There are many theories. It has long been speculated that Jack the Ripper had to be a surgeon because of the way the bodies of his victims were cut up. - I've read a few books on Jack the Ripper and a number of theories as to who committed the crimes. It's always interesting to me that people propose members of the royalty or very well known figures. I think it's probably most likely that the person who committed the crimes is somebody that nobody's mentioned, that wasn't a prominent individual, that was just a person who did his crimes and either moved on or was perhaps, I mean, there's theories that he was perhaps incarcerated or was ill. Maybe he just felt the heat was too hot and he moved somewhere else. - Could be male, female, a group, or a nobody. There are several books arguing it was a media thing. Hype and there was no real single killer. - One of these Jack the Ripper theorists is Dr. Dirk Duran Gibson, author of many books on serial killers. He has a new theory about Jack the Ripper. - The Jack the Ripper murders and the perpetrator are one of the biggest and longest lasting mysteries in crime. Different people have been proposed as the killer. Some were Americans, American surgeons and businessmen who happened to have collections of uteruses, pickled in jars for medical purposes or for their own pleasure. British royalty have been mentioned as a possible perpetrator. I have a different theory. At the time of the Ripper murders in the late 1880s, Britain was a very stratified country, almost a caste system. The people in the West End lived in opulent mansions and had waiters and staffs and maids. The folks in the East End struggled to live. There were things called dosshouses where you could sleep for a night. And the plight of the poor in the East End is hard to describe. Every spring when the Thames River flooded, there were thousands of drownings by people who lived near the Thames River in basement apartments and their landlord wouldn't tell them of the flooding. And then when the floods came, they'd lock the door from the outside so that their tenants would die, they'd get all their material, and they'd clean the place up, do it again the next year. George Bernard Shaw has written about the plight of the poor. There was commission after commission, Parliament did studies, and nothing happened. My theory is the Jack the Ripper crimes were designed to publicize the plight of the poor. At this time in history, there was a huge poverty issue in Great Britain in the East End. There was anti-crown feeling. Many folks didn't like the Queen and the monarchy system. There was also an event called the Trafalgar Square Massacre where a bunch of poor people held a march to ask for food and the response of the British government was to send troops in on horses and trample people. And lots of people died, lots of folks were hurt for daring to say please give us food. The man who was put in charge of the CID of Great Britain and Justification Division was a former general. And many of the Ripper letters mention him by name. His name was Warren. So it's my theory that the crimes were committed as a media event to draw attention to the plight of the poor and it worked. - Many serial killers would follow the profile of Jack the Ripper. Sadistic killers who murdered and mutilated the bodies of prostitutes. Jack the Ripper was the first and most publicized of the international serial killers but he certainly wasn't the last. It should come as no surprise that America's neighbor to the north has not been saved from this monstrous crime. Indeed, the most barbaric of all serial murderers is the man or woman who kills children. Such was Canada's Clifford Robert Olson. AKA The Beast of British Columbia, who became Canada's national monster. A fiend who mutilated and killed at least 11 children and young adults between the ages of nine and 18 years old in the early 1980s. - You don't usually find adult men who just kill children. Is it possible? Certainly, anything's possible. That's usually not their primary focus. Sometimes a serial killer might kill one or two children while they're killing adult women or killing adult men, but you don't usually find only children, very rare. I have a case in Canada where he killed 11 teenagers. And when I say children, I'm thinking about under 12. Clifford Olson, again, he killed 11 children with a hammer. And I did actually interview him as well. What was he like? - Not very smart. Not very intelligent at all but very, very dangerous. Not to me dangerous but to teenagers obviously. He had a terrible childhood and he was simply acting out his own angst. And he liked attention, because he was nobody. He felt like he was nobody. He actually asked me one time if I would write a book about him. And he sent me this letter, Doctor, would you please write a book about me? So I thought about it and I wrote back to him. I said, well, there's two reasons why I'm not gonna write a book about you. One, you're old news. Okay, you're old news. Two, actually there were three reasons. Two, nobody knows you here in the US, no one knows of your case in Canada. And the truth is, I underlined this, you're nobody. I underlined it, I said to him. He was so upset. Yeah, he tried to get me but no, no, no. - Olson tried to solve his lack of notoriety in the serial killer world in an unusual way. - Several years ago, I spoke with a serial killer in Canada, Clifford Olson, who had raped, tortured, and murdered 11 children in British Columbia. He called himself the British Columbia Monster with some pride and he started confessing to me murders that I knew he couldn't have possibly committed. But he wanted to be kind of the Heisman Trophy winner of serial murder. You know, suggesting that he had amassed the largest body count in history, so he was taking credit for the crimes committed in Seattle by the Green River Killer who eventually was caught and confessed to having killed 48 prostitutes. He was confessing to crimes all over the country in the United States and in his own country. - Olson was born on New Year's Day in 1940. A troubled child, he was constantly getting into fights. As an adult, he was in and out of prison. And by the time of his serial killing spree, Olson was a middle aged habitual criminal. Yet by many accounts, he was a rarity, a stupid psychopath. Olson's first victim was found on Christmas Day 1980. Christine Weller, an innocent 12 year old girl, had been strangled and mutilated. Then when Colleen Johnsrude, 16, was found dead that same spring, it became apparent to Vancouver police that the unspeakable was happening in their city. A child serial killer was on the loose. May brought the disappearance of Sandra Wolfsteiner, also 16. And in June, 13 year old Ada Court and nine year old Susan Parington went missing. All of southern British Columbia as well as Vancouver was terrorized. In July 1981, six more victims followed in quick succession. All of them raped and strangled or bludgeoned to death. Among them, Judy Kozma, 14, and Raymond King Jr., 15. The missing children were becoming a blight on one of Canada's fairest cities. Police finally focused on Olson. He was put under heavy surveillance but when it appeared he had nothing to hide, the surveillance was lifted. The huge mistake allowed Olson to murder three more youngsters in late July before being arrested when he attempted to pick up yet another pair of young girls. Olson was convicted of 11 murders but this figure may understate the total number of his victims by a considerable margin. In September 2011, it was revealed Olson had terminal cancer and had been transferred to a hospital in Laval, Quebec. Canada's most brutal monster died on September 30th, 2011, at the age of 71. Besides his desire to become the greatest serial killer of all time, his motive is still uncertain. He claimed that the effects of prison made him more dangerous. He stated that after courts kept him in prison for 30 years and then allowed him out, society was responsible for his crimes. He declared "They never should have let me out." 10 years after Olson's horrendous crimes held Vancouver in a grip of terror, Canada's buddy kinky sex killers, Paul Bernardo and Karla Homolka, started their vicious killing spree. Paul Bernardo was born on August 27th, 1964. He was described as an adorable baby with bright blue eyes, thick wavy blond hair, and a cherubic smile. He was a Boy Scout and a good student. However, he ran away at the age of five or six and returned home several days later. No one ever asked him where he had been. He did not socialize with other children and was subject to violent temper tantrums. After high school, he attended the Scarborough branch of the University of Toronto. Karla Leanne Homolka was born on May 4th, 1970. Her father was a Czech immigrant and salesman. Her mother worked at St. Catherine's Shaver Hospital. Though she had a consistently acrimonious relationship with her parents, she had an enjoyable childhood. She made friends easily and was a very good student. She did, however, have the disconcerting habit of yelling fuck at inappropriate times and during her teen years, angst led to self-mutilation. She intentionally slit her wrists with a small knife a couple of times. Bernardo and Homolka, just a couple of young Canadians ready to join paths in serial killing. It began when at age 17, Homolka attended a pet convention in Toronto, where she met 23 year old Paul Bernardo. They had sex the day they met. Besides an interest in pets, they found they shared something else. Sadomasochistic fantasies. It started with rape but quickly led to murder. Murders that took place between December 23rd, 1990 and April 16th, 1992. - The crimes of Paul Bernardo and Karla Homolka were among the most disgusting of the serial killer cases. Paul Bernardo, before his serial murder career began, was known as the Scarborough Rapist. He raped approximately 350 women over a series of years. When he and Karla got together, he was a macho man and Karla was kind of unconfident. So for Christmas one year, Karla gave Paul her sister as a sex toy. They took her downstairs to the basement and they gave her food laced with Halcion and then they put a cloth saturated with ether over her face. Before Paul could rape her though, she choked on her own vomit. And I think that level of deplorability is not common in all serial murder cases. Another thing they did that was especially terrible is when they caught a woman, they would kidnap her, take her home, rape her and torture her, and then make her watch TV coverage of the crimes. And I consider that to be a psychological sadistic act that is not often found in serial murder cases. They turned on each other after the event and Karla pled to a lesser crime and her testimony put Paul away. But I think when you look at all the things they did, they were just horrible, horrible people and unusually vicious serial killers. - Like other buddy serial killing teams, one is usually dominant. - It is believed that Paul was the leader, that he attracted Karla, Karla wanted him and would do anything to get him. As in many cases, the exact victimage is unknown. The best guess is four or five victims. - On June 29th, 1991, just 14 days after murdering Leslie Mahaffy, Bernardo and Homolka were married in an elaborate wedding at a church in Niagara on the Lake, Ontario. The guests were served a lavish sit down meal after the couple exchanged their vows. Vows which included, at Bernardo's insistence, Homolka promising to love, honor, and obey her new husband. They looked like the perfect loving couple but they were anything but. Eventually, the Canadian media and public played a role in this deadly couple's capture. - Many of times, if there aren't leads in a case, publicity will bring in enough tips that someone can be caught. That happened the case of Paul Bernardo and Karla Homolka, who were escaping with their crimes until the police broadcast a TV show about this and a couple witnesses realized what they knew and the salience of their information of the crimes and they called in. - Recognizing the writing was on the wall, Homolka confessed to their evil deeds. Bernardo was arrested shortly after. When law enforcement searched Bernardo's home, they found a diary where he had memorialized his evil deeds. Having struck a plea deal in 1993, Karla Homolka was released from prison 12 years later on July 4th, 2005. Paul Bernardo is serving a life sentence. Many claim their punishments were not nearly enough for the crimes carried out by this deadly couple. South of the United States, Latin America has no shortage of serial killers. One of the worst was Angel Maturino ResÃ©ndiz, also known as the Railroad Killer. An itinerant Mexican serial killer suspected in as many as 23 murders across the United States and Mexico during the 1990s. Some of his crimes also involved sexual assault. ResÃ©ndiz became known as the Railroad Killer because most of his murders were committed near the train boxcars he used to travel across the US and Mexico. - Angel ResÃ©ndiz, the Railroad Killer, who I interviewed about three months before he was executed, he claimed to hear voices in his head. And I said, well, how did you pick your victims? And he said, well, I knew who my victims were gonna be because I had a tingling across the back of my neck. And I said, well, what did that tell you? And he said that either means they were involved in Satanic cult rituals or they had performed an abortion sometime in the last two years. So as far as he was concerned, that was setting him off and he was feeling this tingling behind, which basically shows that he was partially psychotic if not more psychotic than most people think. Because I do think in my interview, I only had about an hour and a half, but I got the impression he believed what he was telling me. He had no reason to lie. He was basically waiving all of his appeals. He was gonna be executed. And he talked about the abuse that he'd been involved in but he also talked about the voices and he also talked about this tingling. And I don't believe that happened. A rational person wouldn't. But I believe he believes it, which means he was mentally ill, clinically. - Angel Maturino ResÃ©ndiz was born in Mexico in 1960. Faced with a rough childhood filled with physical abuse, he ran away from home at a young age and lived on the street. At the age of 16, ResÃ©ndiz started a pattern that he would follow for his entire adult life. He would enter the US illegally, serve time in US prisons for crimes such as assault and car theft, eventually be deported back to Mexico, and then illegally reenter the US again. ResÃ©ndiz' first known killings were the 1986 double homicide of a homeless couple in San Antonio, Texas. From then on, the sound of a train whistle struck terror throughout the country. Five years later, ResÃ©ndiz claimed his final two victims in Gorham, Illinois. An 80 year old man and his 52 year old daughter. He might have continued his serial murdering except that his fingerprints were found at the scene of the crime. Immediately, the FBI added ResÃ©ndiz to its top 10 most wanted list. On July 13th, 1999, a Texas Ranger met ResÃ©ndiz on a bridge connecting El Paso, Texas and Juarez, Mexico. ResÃ©ndiz surrendered. The Railroad Killer's rampage was over. ResÃ©ndiz, who was suspected of killing at least 25 people in five states and Mexico, was executed at the age of 46 in 2006. However, between 1969 and 1980, with over hundreds of girl victims between nine and 12 years old, the worst serial killer in modern times was South America's Pedro Alonso LÃ³pez, the Monster of the Andes. - He's believed to have killed 350 kids. 350, and they found the victims. They found 'em in mass graves, found 'em in single graves. He was picking up kids while their parents were playing a squeegee game on the streets and trying to earn some money by cleaning windows on cars that drove by. And he posed as a priest, he posed as a counselor, he posed as a friend of the family. You know, he posed as a whole range of people who could basically lure this child away from where he was supposed to be playing or where he was supposed to be. - I talked last week with a journalist from an Australian newspaper about this case. Why, I don't know, it wasn't an anniversary. Pedro LÃ³pez was one of the saddest serial murder cases that I'm aware of, both because of the terrible nature of his life and the terrible nature of what he did to people. He was born the seventh child of 15 people. His dad wasn't around, his mom was a prostitute, and supposedly with a bad temper. When he was eight, his mom thought that he was touching his sister's breasts. He was kicked out of the house. So at the age of eight, he was fending for himself. Then he met a kindly gentleman who offered to help him, but the gentleman was a pederast. Pedophile. Took him home, abused him, and the boy escaped. Then he went to Bogota, where an American missionary family found him and they put him in school. He was very happy until at the age of I think 11 or 12, he was kicked out of the school, supposedly for stealing money. But there's a thread of thought that says that he was molested by a teacher there. So at this point, he's on the street again. He gets active in auto theft and gets arrested and put in prison and was gang raped his first day in prison by a gang of four men. So his early life was not very good. He had a terrible life and it's believed, in fact he said at one point that he was getting revenge on all the people who hurt him. He killed three of the four men in prison and got an extra two years. Then he was released from prison. When he did, he went to Peru. And this is where the story gets strange. Supposedly, he killed 100 kids in Peru, 100 more in Ecuador, and 100 more in Colombia. Before he lured them away, he dug a grave in an isolated area. Then in a strange aspect of this crime, he'd keep the girl alive or boy, mostly girls. He'd keep 'em alive until dawn. He wanted to see the look on their faces when he killed them. Then after they were dead, he had a tea party with the deceased. He had little cups and saucers and convinced himself that his victims liked it, they were enjoying the party, when in fact they most likely were not. - That man is now out on parole. He did approximately one month for every victim. He's now released again. Is he gonna kill again? What's gonna stop him? - Tragically in 1998, the Monster of the Andes was declared sane and released on $50 bail. More than two decades later, no knows if LÃ³pez is dead or alive. Traveling across the pond from North America to Europe, the pattern of serial murderers has repeated itself. Repeated itself because since the mid 19th century, like America, Europe had become industrialized, urbanized, creating large victim pools for serial killers. Victim pools made up of prostitutes, poor immigrants, and poverty stricken families and children. A serial murder case in point, the Yorkshire Ripper. In the late 1970s, a serial killer the press dubbed the Yorkshire Ripper terrorized England. Just like his predecessor 90 years earlier, this Yorkshire Ripper cleverly eluded the police while he committed his vicious crimes. But unlike Jack the Ripper, we know his name. Peter Sutcliffe. - Peter Sutcliffe was known as the modern day Jack the Ripper. He had an extensive career, a 12 year long career, which is unusual. And as a result of that, there was a substantial investigation. His MO, he was a truck driver. His MO was to strike someone on the back of the head with his sledgehammer and then when they were stunned, he would strangle them. Then he would rape the victim, rape the dead body, and kinda discard it at the place, didn't do a lot. He, interestingly enough, his career almost ended before it began. Before his first successful murder, he tried to murder a woman who stopped him and got his license number and the police came to his house and investigated and he admitted it. He said that he didn't know why he did it and he's glad the woman didn't die, but he wouldn't do it again, promised he wouldn't do it again. And it's interesting that happens again and again in serial murder cases. The killers are apprehended early and then law enforcement let them go and their career continues. - And continue it did. In October 1975, Sutcliffe attacked and killed 28 year old Wilma McCann, a mother of four. Sutcliffe struck McCann in the head with a ball-peen hammer and viciously stabbed her 15 times. His appetite whet, the killer attacked again and again, killing at least 13 people and perhaps as many as 30. Mostly prostitutes, but not all. It wasn't until January 2nd, 1981, that the Yorkshire Ripper's deadly reign finally ended. - He said at trial that he was sent by God to get rid of bad women, of illicit women, and that was the motivation for the crime. He also said though that he was humiliated by a prostitute when he was younger, when he couldn't successfully have sex with her, so he began his career to avenge himself on the women that had mocked him. - Another European Jack the Ripper wannabe was Poland's Red Spider, Lucian Staniak. Born in 1941, little is known about his life because he did his killing behind the Cold War's Iron Curtain. But like Ted Bundy, he acquired his female victims through charm and romantic overtures. Then he killed, raped, and mutilated them, sometimes in that order. His serial killing reign of terror lasted for three years between 1964 and 1967. - Lucian Staniak was an Eastern European Cold War era killer and we know very little about these crimes because they were suppressed and the media would not give any information. Lucian Staniak was privileged in that he had a very good job. He was a translator for a publishing company and as a result, he had a special train pass that allowed him to travel all over Poland on the rail system. And that was his MO. He'd see a woman on the train, approach her, charm her, and when they got to their destination, they go off for some privacy, at which point her would strangle them, kill them, rape them, and mutilate the bodies. He was an especially unpleasant serial killer. His victimology included two types of people. Besides the train passengers, he was a member of an art club and it's believed he killed two members of the art club who were sisters. Which is very rare. Very seldom in serial murder history, do you have members of the same family being killed. Unlike mass murder, where it's kind of common. He was apprehended when a special task force was created and there's a belief that serial killers won't kill in their hometown, they kill elsewhere. So the investigation centered on places, where the bodies were found were discounted and the murders were committed, and they went to big cities where victims hadn't been located. And he was one of 1,000 people or so who were identified in this way. When police searched his locker at the art club, they found a painting of a woman being tortured and being killed, which led them to interview him. Another aspect of Staniak is he was a writer. Like I mentioned before, many serial killers are motivated by communication and they need to communicate. He wrote five letters to newspapers and I'd like to share with you a brief glimpse of these five publications. At the first murder, which was July 4th, 1964, he wrote a newspaper and said "There's no happiness without tears, "no life without death. "Beware, I'm going to make you cry." Three weeks later, he killed again and wrote a letter to another newspaper saying "I picked a juicy flower in Olstyn "and I shall again somewhere else. "There is no holiday without a funeral." At the final killing, he slipped a note through the slot of a mail car, different than his previous submissions to newspapers, and this note simply said "On the day before Christmas, "you see I've done it again." So Staniak is an example of a killer for whom the communication attended to the crime may have been the motivation behind the crime or at least the prime impetus. - Staniak, who killed at least 14 innocent women, was called the Red Spider because of his red spidery handwriting. Today, even with the fall of the Iron Curtain, it isn't known if he is dead or behind bars somewhere. The Staniak case reflects the difficulty of tracking serial murder in much of the world. Poor police work, nonexistent records, and an unwillingness to claim or even recognize serial killing as a problem in the country. However, one interesting distant international case points to a serial killer who may have been trained to kill by his country. Yoshio Kodaira, Japan's most notorious serial killer. Kodaira, a Japanese sailor, was one of the few ex-military men who said that the Japanese military had committed atrocities before and during the war. Indeed, as a sailor, Kodaira had raped and murdered Chinese civilians in the years leading up to World War II. After the war, it is believed that between May 25th, 1945 and August 6th, 1946, in Tochigi in Tokyo, Kodaira raped and murdered at least 10 women in age from 15 to 32. - Yoshio Kodaira was a post-World War II killer. And it's interesting, at the same time he was committing crimes, there was a second Japanese serial killer with the same exact MO. And we know this because at trial, Kodaira admitted the crimes he committed but vehemently denied his guilt in the other crimes. Then later, the other criminal was apprehended. Kodaira had a checkered past. He was a Japanese sailor in World War II, he committed war crimes. He raped it's believed between 40 and 60 civilians. He killed six unarmed Chinese soldiers. And in the most horrible act, he stabbed a pregnant woman, killed her, and took out the fetus and killed the fetus. He also killed his father-in-law, which wasn't part of the serial murders but happened much earlier in his life. And in post-World War II Japan, there was a lot of shortages. The black market was the only place you could get certain kind of goods. And he was positioned in a store where he had access to things like this. So his MO was to lure women to isolated areas in the hopes they would obtain commodities from him or products that he could never get otherwise. His downfall was interesting. He gave his last victim's parents his name. He went to the house to pick her up, which is unusual for serial killers, and told her parents who he was. So when the girl didn't come home, they knew who to come after and who to apprehend. - Kodaira was executed by hanging on October 5th, 1949. One thing is certain in the study of modern serial killing. As the rest of the world continues to industrialize and urbanize, serial murder will be on the rise.
