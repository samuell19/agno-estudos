Four years ago, Daniela S was accused of having killed her husband, Thomas S, when shooting in the High Tatras. Boris N, the only witness, testified in court that it was an accident. Why does she come here again? I... I just can't understand this, Anna. He is still here. I remember it well. They used to behave like Romeo and Juliet. Now they'll meet here again. And Daniela is... remarried... to a western diplomat... who works in Prague for some embassy. Well done, Caesar! Good dog! And you be quiet! Here, Anna... I shot them for you. Now, tell me... when do our guests arrive, Anna? You're playing dumb again. Hello? Hello? Yes, I'm coming. Anybody here? You'll like it here - I'm sure. Hello? - You must be Anna. - Mm-hm. - Is anyone else here yet? - Dr Bertram arrived a few hours ago. Anna... this is my wife Daniela. How do you do? She didn't want to come at first, but then she changed her mind. And this... And this is Mrs Henning. - Hello. - Welcome! My wife doesn't like shooting. Mrs Henning will keep her company when I go bear-shooting. You know, I want to shoot my 12th bear. Yes, I know. - Good day. - Hello. I'm Boris. I'm here to oversee the activities. Especially to see that the dogs come back alive. - Stephan Matthisen. - A pleasure. - That is my wife. - Er... yes. And that is Mrs Henning. So you'll be my guide. Could you take my cases please? Of course. Your room's upstairs. Which is Dr Bertram's room? His room, Mrs... - Henning! - Henning.... Dr Bertram's room is right next to yours. Things are a bit basic here. - I like that. - Oh, really? Then you won't mind the shower being down the corridor. - Really? - Mm-hm. Here we are. - Please. - Thank you. Please put the bags there. This is for you. I'm a hunter. But for money... I'll even carry cases! A strange fellow. He doesn't look like a hunter. I thank you. Whatever for? For coming with me. I don't know... whether it was the right thing to do. I really don't know. We'll see. It was right. - Our hunting lodge. - Wonderful. - Please. - Thank you. Hello, my name is Marek, Doctor. Hello. I'm Matthisen. - Hello. - A pleasure. This is Dr Hermann, another guest of this morning's sport. This is my wife Daniela. - How do you do. - How do you do. Mrs Henning and Dr Bertram. Dr Bertram will go hare-shooting tomorrow. The pheasants already know his marksmanship. Good day. Thank you, Anna. Anna... Anna, I hate these shoots. They come here... these pretend sportsmen. All they're interested in is killing. Death, Anna. The women are worse. Hello. - Excuse me, am I disturbing you, Marek? - No, not at all. We're pleased. Do sit down, please. You... You want to shoot a bear? - Yes, sure. - Mm-hm. Fine. I'm here to shoot my 12th bear. Adventure tales are told about the 12th. Many tales are told... They say it's dangerous. Luckily I'm not superstitious. Danger attracts me. I'd still be careful. They've been farm-raised and released, but are still dangerous. No doubt. But I'm not a novice, Marek. I've shot bears before. In the north of Canada. Don't worry about me. I can take care of myself. I'm an expert at bear-shooting. All the better for you. It was just a well-meant piece of advice, Dr Matthisen. I do accept your advice. Dr Matthisen. Here's a letter for you. Marek... just brought it. Thank you, Anna. A letter from our bank in Geneva, Daniela. Dr Matthisen, if you're not interested in shooting pheasants or hares, I suggest you shoot a wild boar or a buck. A good idea... But let's talk about it tomorrow. I'm too tired to talk about details now. What will you do tomorrow, Daniela? I'd go for a walk. This region is very impressive. Are there horses here? Of course. They're still at the farm. The farmer likes to rent them... to tourists and holidaymakers. The horses are a favourite... especially of young lovers. Call me if there's anything you need. Thank you, Anna. I'll be in the kitchen. Good night. Good night! We should go to bed. It was a long trip. Good. I'll make the first move. Wake me in good time, Boris. - Good night. - Good night. Could that mean bad luck? It was a shoot like this one. The bag was great. And there were two dead beaters! One of the guests asked me: 'You're allowed to shoot beaters too?' Enough stupid jokes! You should have said earlier if you don't like it. Lighten up, Anna! Thank you, Anna. It would be better if you join the others. Boar-shooting is very dangerous. Wild boars don't wait for you to aim. They break loose... and then you have to be quick. You don't have to tell me that. I'm sure I've shot more boars than you. So you know, when the boar comes, there are two options: pull the trigger, or climb the nearest tree. You'll be climbing the tree before I will! Welcome to our state shoot. The season is open! We'll meet again at dusk. You are familiar with the rules, gentlemen. Let's begin! Good shooting! Not much has changed here since last time. Don't you agree, Anna? Is Boris alone? Yes...you know that. I wonder why... he doesn't marry. And again we meet when shooting. What a coincidence, don't you think? Great the way you miss, Dr Bertram. I've only shot pheasants before. These jittery hares make me nervous. The dog is charging ahead. The hare is still alive. - I can't watch! - The gunshots set the dogs off. You dirty beast! I told you they were dangerous! There you are. You can be proud of this trophy. Hello, Boris! Where were you? Have a drink. Are we friends again? Of course. It's all forgotten, Dr Matthisen. I don't bear grudges. Come, let's have a drink together. Sit with Daniela. She's bored. Here, take this. No, Dr Matthisen. Thank you. What a pity. So... - To your health! - Thank you. Tell me, Boris. How long have you been here? More than five years. I don't want to leave. I've grown to like the loneliness and quietness. You're still young. I enjoy riding alone in the woods. The animals... the woods... they fulfil me. What more could one want? You're really so contented? What do you mean? People need other people to make them happy. Haven't we met before? You know... before I met Stephan... I was never interested in shooting. How do you think we could have met? Ah well... in that case I must be mistaken. You remind me of someone. Stephan, come dance with me. Let them talk. Good idea! I'd like to dance a waltz with you. Fantastic, Stephan. You dance wonderfully. I have everything I wished for. But you don't look so happy. I wasn't as lucky as you... Now you're Mrs. Matthisen! Stop pitying yourself. Do you still love me? I'm here because of you. Your health, Mrs Matthisen! Stephan, I'm tired. You stay. I'm going upstairs. Daniela, it's much too early. The fun's only just starting. Boris, come on. We won't let Daniela spoil your mood. Come on! Let's dance! I'd like to talk to you. But I need to get up early. You go to bed. My dear, Boris is right. Good night. - You play very well, Anna. - Thank you! Do you mind if I smoke? Of course I don't mind. What do you want from Daniela? That's no business of yours. I've been watching you. Something's going on between you. She's happily married, Boris. She's very happy with him. Very happy. That's what you say. I, too, am happily married. And I'm very happy. My husband gives me all I want. Can't you see how happy I am? But all you can do is clean your stupid gun. I don't need anyone like you. I don't need a man at all. Men! What are men? What shall I do with men? Men like you! You should meet my husband. Boris... My husband is a decent man. He isn't common, vulgar or brutal. My husband is tender and loving. Come on. Be brutal, be vulgar to me! Come on! You call that brutal? My husband can do better than that. You washout! You swine! Who do you think you are? There's something between you and Daniela. I'm not as stupid as you think. She loves her husband. Do you want to threaten me? But not in your state. Now get out! I wish you a very good night. What a way to talk to a married woman! - It's what you wanted. - You're not my type, madam. Who do you think you're talking to? Who do you think you are? - Do you think Daniela's better than me? - Stop it! Good night! Daniela, are you all right? I couldn't sleep. The quiet outside... it frightens me. I don't know how people can stand it. - All one hears is birds and dogs. - Daniela... that's nonsense. Before long you'll have to get used to the quiet and the noises here. It's so nice here. Say something kind to me. Good morning. Come, Caesar! Good morning, Anna. Good morning. Could you take this to Daniela? It's touching how you take care of everything. But this is none of your business. You're mistaken, Boris. Down, Caesar! It is my business. What happened then belongs in the past. And I don't want to talk to you about it. Oh, Anna... Butter, honey, ham. Tell me if you need anything else. Why were the dogs barking so much? Oh, Boris took Caesar out. He's going to the mill. - Enjoy your breakfast. - Thank you, Anna. - Good morning. - Good morning! I feel exhausted. Yesterday's shooting really tired me. Can I have a cigarette? I must have left mine somewhere. Your cigarettes? There they are. Where's Dr Bertram? I didn't see him last night. Dr Bertram? I don't know where he got to. He didn't show up after the hare-shooting. You know what I miss here, Daniela? A handsome sportsman who's a better shot than he is. Sorry, I didn't know you were here. It's fine, Anna. You're not disturbing me. I envy your life here. Here one can relax and forget about things. My wife will soon begin to enjoy it. I'm always at your service. And I thank you, Anna. You really are a treasure. Boris, why are you following me? Here of all places? What do you want? You know very well what I want. Or have you forgotten what was? You were waiting here for me. Admit it! You knew that I'd be coming. All right then. I am here because of you. Do you think I've changed a lot? So much has happened during these last few years. What do you make of me now? You haven't changed. Is that all you have to say? Let's be sensible. Please, Boris... What do you want from me? All this frightens me... Is it possible that whenever we meet... and the woods are close, that there's a terrible accident? Sleep with me, Daniela! My dear, I think you're crazy. You provoke me. Don't you want that? You keep asking questions. Whose answer do you want? Mine or Stephan's? You keep asking such questions! So you're not going bear-shooting? Pity. - Boris is a good hunter. - Yes, I know. Believe me, you really can trust him. This bear is my fate, Marek. But I'm not afraid. Now tell me... about your animals here. What can I tell you? The beasts are cunning. They're unpredictable and wily. You never know where you stand. Even if you're an experienced gunman, Dr Matthisen... you never know... what they'll do next, you have no idea what they're thinking. Stephan? Are you asleep? I want to talk to you. I must talk to you. I'm tired, Daniela. And I have to get up early tomorrow. But Stephan, it's important... for both of us. Daniela... one shouldn't talk about certain things. Go to sleep. Everything is fine. Believe me. Stephan, look! It snowed. You think we can hire a sled with horses? I've just been outside. It's wonderful. Oh, why... didn't you wake me? I'd have liked to have gone with you. You were sleeping like a baby. Stephan... Don't leave me alone again. Daniela, don't be childish. We've been here three days now, and I haven't seen a bear. I won't leave you alone. But you said you didn't like shooting. I... I'm so afraid... all of a sudden... I don't know why. I don't know what's wrong with me. Daniela, be reasonable, please. Dr Bertram's waiting for me. Dr Bertram is more important than I am? Your business is more important? Actually, it is important, Daniela. We have to discuss financial matters. Money! Money! A pity. In that case the first snow has fallen for me alone. Angela is here. Do something with her. Or let Boris show you the area. What about that? I wanted to do something with you, but you only talk about business. Go ahead! Enjoy yourself... with Dr Bertram. There is no point in waking her. She's still fast asleep. Angela never gets up before eleven. Do you like it? I'm having breakfast alone, but I always like your food. Winter is my favourite season. Winter to me means snow... Hot punch, Christmas... security... - Do you know where Boris is? - He's at your old mill. There are so many 'ifs' and 'buts' in this marriage settlement, it's as if she doesn't want to settle anything upon you. If anything were to happen to your wife, you wouldn't inherit a thing, Dr Matthisen. You really think so? According to the letter from the Geneva bank, she wants to have the last word. Try to make her change the settlement. You mean... she wants to keep me waiting? How very smart! I'm sure about that. Had you listened to me, you'd have a new marriage settlement, and you'd be financially secure. We're friends, Stephan. Let's not fool ourselves. You have high demands. That costs money. I'll give it another try. After all, I came here with my wife to settle these things. Don't rush things. You'll be all right as long as your wife's still alive. Why this hint? I love Daniela. She's a wonderful woman. Or do you think I married her for her money? What I think has nothing to do with it. It's facts that count... and money. I don't agree. But what do you advise? Financially, nothing can happen to you as long as you're married. You can use as much money as you want, as long as you don't separate. She mustn't come to any harm before she has signed the new settlement. Won't you stay here for a little longer? My wife would be delighted. If you don't mind my playing chess, with pleasure. The pleasure is all mine. I knew you'd come. Is your wife feeling more at home now, Dr Matthisen? I don't think so. She wants to go home. As soon as possible. What's Boris like, as a person? Fantastic hunter, but... Would you like another drink? Yes, Anna, I think so. Thank you, Anna. Come on. Don't let me do it all alone. I love you. What about Stephan? He isn't here, so he isn't important. And whoever isn't here doesn't exist. It's just the two of us. It was very nice. I'd like just to stay here. May I ask you something, please? No... please don't ask me anything... Be quiet... It's nice like this. I like just to lie next to you, touching you and feeling you. I love you. I'm a bad person. And what am I...? An adulteress. An adulteress? Why do you say that? I love you. Don't you want me? I don't mind... I love you. It's late. We should leave. Daniela, come with me. No... I'd like to stay here. Where have we been so long? I don't know. Think of something. - Good evening, Stephan. - It's late! Wait, I'll help you. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Come to bed. Come to bed. Anna, I foresaw this. This was bound to happen. I hope it turns out well. Daniela... May I ask you something? You don't have to answer. Have you met Boris before? Yes. Where? Where did you meet him? I met him when shooting. It was here... I was very young... You understand? You're the only person I love. Whatever happened, I love you. Whatever happened, you can tell me. Did you love him, Daniela? Yes. And what do you feel for him now? I don't want to talk about it now. - Stephan? - Yes? I'm sorry... What about? About... about what happened yesterday. - Think it'll work? - Of course. Don't slip. Where shall I try? There? Cast it over there. Relax. Yes, that's it! Look, Stephan... I think I've caught one. See, fishing isn't that difficult. You have to pull! Come on! Stephan, my first fish! Great! Congratulations! That's it. - Ah, good morning. - Good morning. - Catch anything? - I haven't. My wife has. Hello! I have a feeling that I'll shoot my 12th bear today. I can feel it in my fingertips. What do you say, Marek? I don't know. Dr Matthisen... we must leave now, or it'll be too late. I can't go on. Carry on without me. I'll wait here for you. But darling, it isn't much further. It's a fresh trail. Come! I saw him near the clearing yesterday. There he is! No, not this one. - Why not? - Because I say so. He's too young. Put it down, please. You don't shoot before I say so. My dear fellow, you can't tell me what to do. I shoot when I want. You'll pay for that. Stephan, I want to go home, please. And I ask you to stay. Congratulations. That was your 12th bear. And only two shots! Can I go home now? I'm coming, my dear. Boris, we'll talk later. Was it that bad? I just had to get him. Why do you do it? This is how it is when one shoots. It's as if one is possessed. There is just one goal: to remain the victor! For that... For that... days and weeks... you have to wait. Wait! You have to forget everything else. All of a sudden you see the bear. Then there's just one thing to do. Hold the gun still... absolutely still... no thinking... not even breathing... You become one with your prey. The thrill goes right to your fingertips. That means you only aim at him, but also at yourself. It's an inexpressible feeling of satisfaction... sensuous... passionate. It makes you wild. You yourself become an animal. Yes. I know, Stephan. Do you want to go back to him? What do you mean? What I asked you yesterday. Ah, that. I see. No, I don't think so. - Marek! - Yes? I want you to tell me all you know about Boris. Everything, you hear? I've told you all I know about him. You see, Marek... my wife has told me about the affair with Boris. You needn't pretend to me. Honestly. Well... Anna told me... to keep out of this. That's all right. But I've known about it all for some time already. Well, it's a tragic story. No... No. I look at it differently, and I want you to explain it in detail. I assure you, it wasn't your wife's fault. I know. It always takes two... And what does fault mean? I have forgiven her, believe me. You know, Dr. Matthisen... A boar like that is very dangerous! When it attacks there's only on thing to do. Shoot! That's all. What do you mean by that? That's what your wife did then... She killed her husband. It was an accident. Boris was the only witness in court and therefore... she was acquitted. Thank you very much. Thank you, Marek. It's always good to talk, man to man. Goodnight. I thank you. Good night, Dr Matthisen. Daniela, why are you here? - Are you surprised? - Not at all, Mrs Matthisen. You want to sleep with me. You still think you're irresistible. I want to talk to you. Take your clothes off, Daniela. You didn't come to talk to me. I come back here, and you think everything can go on as it was. Why won't you accept that I'm married? Your marriage is a farce. Nonsense! You love me, and not this old man. Please, you must try to understand. - You love me. - And what about you? You ask me that...? I've been waiting for you. And now I want something from you. And I'll get it. I want you. I need you. You shouldn't fight against it. You need me, too. Daniela... he's an old man. You're so beautiful. I don't want you to mess up my life. Listen, my life with Stephan... is exactly the life I want to live. I... I have decided to live like this. But, believe me... I... I... I love Stephan. That's only in your imagination. You're mad about me. If you loved Stephan, you wouldn't have slept with me. Wake up! You love me. You love me and nobody else. You belong to me. Believe me... I love you. I can't carry on without you. I can't live without you. I really can't. I tried to... but... I can't go on. I tried to forget you. I tried for four years. You can't forget what was between us. We loved one another, Daniela. Boris... dear Boris... It's over. We must forget about it. We can't turn the clock back. Let's talk about it sensibly. I know it's hard. But what shall I do? I've risked so much already. But, Daniela, didn't I take a risk for you? Boris... What happened then is haunting me. If I stayed with you, I'd never get away from it. That accident is haunting you. I feel sorry for you. It's thanks to me that you're here. Without me you'd be in prison. I loved you. I committed perjury for you... But, for you, it was only lust. Do you know what you're saying? Of course. Is that the thanks for my keeping quiet? Who are you? You're still at my mercy. I know why I left you. You were only interested in my money. You're a murderer! Let's remain friends. If you need money, tell me. You can have as much as you want. I love Stephan... just as... I did once love you. Daniela, it's too late. You have no chance. You'll never get away from me. You know that I can destroy your life and your marriage. You must stay with me. Goodnight, Boris. Angela, I need your car. Where are the keys? In your bag? Don't think I'm crazy. But I must get away from here. Daniela, you look so pale. What's the matter with you? Nothing... give me the key! I've just got a headache. Be careful. Don't do anything silly. Wake me if you need me. - Where did you go, Daniela? - Out. I asked you where you went. I didn't tell you everything yesterday. Stephan... Even if you don't want to hear the truth... - I have to tell you now. - You don't have to. Yes, Stephan. I wasn't only in love with Boris. I was young... crazy... and full of ideas. We thought the world belonged to us. - You were married. - Ach, Thomas. To Thomas I was only an object. An object to use when he wanted, and to push aside when... he no longer wanted it. That's all I was to him. And all his affairs... so cheap... without style... so terribly harrowing. It was so... humiliating. Did he know about Boris? I don't know. I don't think so. He must have noticed something. Maybe he did notice. He turned so cold and cynical. I started to hate... his whole arrogance, his self-confidence... the whole show he put on. And then he went shooting... The boar was hit, but not killed. Thomas wanted to finish it off. Then it... Then it got up again... and I shot... blindly. Everybody said it was an accident. Only Boris... he was there. He saw what happened. He's my only witness, and he took the oath. In that case, it was an accident. Stephan, it wasn't an accident. I wanted to kill him. And I did. If the court decided it was an accident, then it was an accident! No! Boris committed perjury. Daniela... Calm down. This is all in the past. Why do you torture yourself? That's why I didn't want to come back here again. That's why I was afraid of this trip. I keep being reminded. I keep seeing these pictures. And Boris, I don't understand... It's as if he were possessed. Believe me, Boris will stop at nothing. Are you afraid of him? Or do you still love him? No. Of course I was in love at the beginning, like a silly girl. And I gave him a lot of money. All that isn't important. He'll do anything to ruin me. I can feel it. He thinks I'm subordinate to him. I have to shake him off somehow. Even if I have to cut myself loose from him completely. He doesn't want your money. He wants you, my dear. It isn't as easy as that. No. Boris wants to take revenge. He already tried to blackmail me. I'm sure he'll never leave us alone. I don't know what to do. Even if I give him money, he'd always be between us. We must find another solution. I'm so confused, Stephan. Help me! I can't stand the burden any longer. And I won't... I don't want him to destroy our happiness. Daniela... I love you. You needn't worry. I'll settle it somehow. I'm so afraid. Help me! I must bear in mind that he might report me to the police. And that... would be the end. Then you'll have lost me forever. Please, darling... Say something. Talk to me! This fear will drive me mad. We must do something. Daniela... Let us go away. Far from here. Darling, that's no solution. He'd follow us. But what shall I do then? Shall I shoot him too? You want me to do that?! Don't just stand there! You're asking me to murder him. Stephan? Did I wake you? No. Go back to sleep. Please... do me a favour... Don't go shooting. But that's what I came here for. Stay here. What are you afraid of, darling? That something might happen to you. Nothing'll happen to me. You shouldn't overestimate yourself. There he is. Yes, shoot now. You're blackmailing my wife. You didn't get him properly once again, Mr Matthisen Leave my wife alone! Take a good shot. I'm warning you! Stop, I'll do it. You stay here. Boris, you're crazy. He's even more dangerous when he's wounded. Oh no, I'll use the knife. That could have turned out badly. If you'd shot me, it'd have looked like an accident. Wouldn't you have shot in such a situation? What do you mean? I could have waited for the bear to tear you to pieces. All just because of Daniela? Yes, that's it, Boris. All just because of Daniela. Did she tell you everything? Indeed. I'm in the picture. What did she say? That you want to blackmail her. I'll give you some good advice. Keep away from my wife. I'm tolerant. But only so far... believe me, Boris. If you need money, we can talk about it. But only once, you understand? Don't put on such airs. You're only after the money. Who are you anyway? You're a failure in every way. I love Daniela. Unlike you, I'm not interested in your wife's money. Are you sure about that? Get on with your work. You're taking it too easy. That won't solve the problem. - Everything all right, Marek? - Yes, everything's all right. Nobody's hurt. Apart from the animals, of course! Everyone's satisfied. Today, more was shot than in the last three days. The bag consists of: 2 bears, 3 boars, 2 deer and 98 pieces of ground game. A fine shoot! - Excellent! Well done! - Yes, a wonderful bag! Will Boris be at the banquet? We had an argument today. So he might not come. What about? We expressed our views about this matter. It got quite heated. He fired a shot as I walked away from him. A bad joke. But I have a strong nerve. Now you know why I'm afraid of him. Yes, darling. You were right. Boris is dangerous. He might even remain so. That means... you didn't do it. I'll tell you why. I couldn't do it. I've learned to solve my problems otherwise. And how do we move on from here? Somehow... I don't know, but we will go on. Please listen to me... I'll arrange to be transferred to another embassy... outside Europe. And then... we'll have left this country forever. You'll be able to forget this whole business forever. Forever. Happy? Dear friends, we have spent a great week of hunting and shooting together. Whatever our world-view may be... we have one thing in common. Field sports! What is more humane, peaceable and... nation binding... than the preservation and care of nature? In this spirit I should like to say: good health to you all! Good health to all! - Angela? - Yes? - Can I borrow your car keys? - What? Again? I'm not feeling too good. I'd like to go. Would you please excuse me? Shall I take you back? No, no. I'd rather go alone. Thank you. I can't stand all these people. Excuse me, Stephan. I'll go with her. Leave her, Angela. I think she wants to be alone. I knew you'd come. I haven't come because of you, Boris. I'm leaving. - We're leaving. - No! It's over. You'll stay with me. No! You can't frighten me any more. Daniela, be careful. You're ridiculous. Leave me alone! Go to the police then! Please... Pl- Leave me alone! There's no point in it. Don't you understand? I'm beginning to hate you. Watch out! The gun's loaded. So what? Are you afraid of me, Boris? Daniela, that's no toy. Put it down. Or do you want to kill me too? Are you going to shoot me, like you did your husband? Boris! Oh, Boris! I saw it coming. I knew this would happen. The shooting is over. The shooting is over? Do you really think so, Dr Matthisen? There are always those who perish. That's a law of nature. Nothing can happen to you if you follow my advice. Take care of your wife now. Her money will give you freedom. You have control of it now, Mr Matthisen. I'll help double it, hm? Good hunting, Dr Bertram! The hunter thanks you, Dr Matthisen. You're wanted outside. Excuse me. I'll be back in a moment. Something terrible has happened. Your wife has shot Boris. Don't worry. I'll sort it out. Yes. This is Matthisen... Dr Matthisen. Please send someone from the embassy. Yes, an accident. A shooting accident. Yes. My wife needs our help. # SONG # Joan Orleans - I'm Still Crazy About You
