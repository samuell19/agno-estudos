English subtitles: Cinegayorg & Leonnos The Christine Jorgensen Story Hey, it's mama's boy! Merry Christmas, Georgette. My name is George Jorgensen Jr. Junior, smunior, I, still say it's Georgette. It's George! You wanna make somethin' out of it, buster? Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas, son. Merry Christmas. In 1933, when I was seven years old, my birth certificate read, "George Jorgensen Jr." There was still a great deal of life to be lived before I would be known as Christine. - Do you know what I'm gonna do? - What, Dolly? I'm gonna make her an evening gown with lace and bows and I'm gonna sew some sequins on it And she's gonna go dancing. Why don't you take your dolls to my house to go dancing? In that silly looking house? We are going to the Waldorf Astoria hotel. Sue, Sue dear, you better gather up your presents now. We'll be going home soon. Just a little longer, Mom. Now, is that a neighborly thing to do, leaving so early? The children are having a good time. How about a Swedish carol, huh? I'll get the glogg. Yeah, real Danish glogg, a recipe my father got from the old country. All right, but just for half an hour. Well, that's New York for you, Son. No sooner does a building go up, then, poof! Down it comes to make room for a bigger one. But I don't like building things, Dad. Well, sure you do. I put up buildings, don't I? Hey, it's a mighty fine business, George. Another couple of years and you'll be building bigger houses than I ever did. I bet our dolls want some tea. That's a good idea. We could all have some together. - The glogg's ready, everybody. - Oh, good. George... Remember? I told you before, your sister has her toys and you have yours. Look, you have so many lovely toys of your own. Come on over, take a look at your erector set. Why don't we build something? Your father will be so proud of you. Let's build a beautiful, big skyscraper, the best building, the most beautiful building in all the world. At that age, I couldn't understand the feminine impulse which made me desire a doll, rather than my own toys. Whoa! Come on, George, it's your turn. Hurry up! Hey, George, one of the boys has to go home. You've got to fill in. I don't know if I'm good enough. We ain't got nobody else. Come on! Can't you even catch a ball? He ducked it, he was too scared to grab it. - He's yeller. - That's what you are. Yeller. I don't like football, it's too rough. Yay! Sissy! Sissy! Georgette doesn't like football. It's too rough! - What a sissy! - All he can do is play with girls! Yeah, a yeller sissy. Georgette! My name is George. Georgette! Georgette! Georgette! Georgette! Georgette! Georgette! Stop it, leave him alone! Get outta here! Are you gonna fight his battles for him? - Come on, get him. - Yeah, get him. Sissy, sissy, sissy! Oh George, don't cry. We'll go home and tell Dad. He'll get 'em. My eye hurts. Oh, boy! Are you gonna have a shiner! George plays real good hopscotch, Dolly, he can play with us tomorrow if he wants to. - You say you hit him first? - Yes, sir. Ah, you hear that, Mother? George showed him. Son, you did exactly what any man would have done. Oh, you're gonna remember that black eye as one of the proudest moments of your whole life. But I got beaten up. Dad! But you wanted to fight, that's the important thing. Every boy's got to know how to fight. Don't worry, you'll learn. Hey, we better get a picture of that black eye while it's still blooming. By the time the print gets back your black eye'll be gone. It will? Yup, everything changes except photographs and the things we remember. Now, don't go away. You said they called you a sissy, George? But they had no right to call me names. Football's too rough. Of course it is. Okay, George, come on in here. I've got the camera. Now, let's see… Over there, by the fireplace, huh? Now, let's see. Oh! Stand up straight. Come on, wash rag down, nice big smile. Oh, ho, ho, that black eye's gonna be an artistic triumph. No more, George. The boy's had enough. Now, Florence, you let the men in the family handle this thing. - Isn't that right, Son? - Right! It's time you put on your clean clothes for dinner. Hurry up! - George... - Now, Florence... Don't start in on him again. He's gonna be all right. Can't you tell that? He needs help. Maybe we should speak to the doctor. He's as healthy as I am. George... In school the other day, the teacher found a doll in his lunch box. He'd been taking it with him every day... Hiding it. The boy will outgrow it. He's already outgrowing it. Did you ever see him start a fight before? The child's different from other children. He always was. He's my son and there's nothing wrong with me. He's every bit as good a man as his father is. But George, you don't want to see what's happening to him. I wanted a son, Florence, and I got one. Nothing can change that. I don't need any doctor to tell me what he is. Sometimes... There are mistakes we don't know about. He has a body of a man, there's been no mistake. - Dad... My eye feels better. - Hey, good. Hey, tell you what, why don't you get a picture of us this time, okay? Come on, Son. - Oh! I look awful! - No, you don't, Florence, come on over here. - All right. - Now, look. All you have to do, Son, is look through there, press that button and the red button, okay? Come on, Florence, stand in here. Stand straight! It's a good thing I still have one good eye to look through here. Yup! Everything changes, except photographs and the things you remember. My father was wrong. For me, there were no tomorrows that weren't filled with loneliness. My father's camera became my only friend. As I grew older, I began to understand how different I really was from other people. Later, I became a professional photographer in an advertising agency. Okay, boys, let's get the castle ready. Listen, Joe, uh... Hit me with this light over here. Um, add a little, a little flood to soften her face. Jim, put a Mitchell B. Diffusion lens on the camera. 150 Let's see, Tani, um... A shade more regal. Think of... Of kings and queens and castles. - How's this, George? - Sit up a little straighter. Here, let me show you. Uh... Like this, with, with grace and elegance... - Okay? - Mmm-hmm! Now... Frank. Look, you're a king, more regal. She's your queen. Tani... That's it, let's shoot it. Okay, that's it for tonight. Wrap it up. Oh! Hello, Jess. Do you like it? Perfect. You know, it takes a real artist to catch the mood of what an advertiser wants. Well... Well, thanks for the assignment. I really appreciate it. Oh, hell. What are friends for? Oh, I already told the boss that you should get yourself a raise. You serious? There'll be an extra check for you this week. Enough for you to really live it up this weekend in Southampton. - Southampton? - Mmm-hmm. I want you shooting the stuff for the Isle of Capri swimsuit account. But... That's one of your top assignments. Mmm-hmm, no problem. You can handle it. Oh, say, uh, how about celebrating with a drink? Hey, that'd be great, Jess, but I can't. My sister's getting married tomorrow, church rehearsal tonight. People still getting married these days? Well, Dolly wants a lot of kids. Can't do that without a husband. - You are a lovely bride, Dolly. - Thank you, Pastor. Pastor, could you stand behind Mom and Dad? Certainly. Okay, Dolly, Jack, just one more picture. Make it a good one. Something they can show their children. Like this? Well, kiss her! My camera's cooling off. You heard the man. Aw! Newlyweds, that's enough! You can quit now. Who asked you? One more. Congratulations, bye-bye. On Dolly's wedding night, I was faced with a new and sudden torture. I was envious of, Dolly's marriage. Jealous that I couldn't be a woman and she was. Listen Tani, uh, this time I want you to whirl around and give me plenty of flare with the cape. - Okay? - Sure. Olive, you can be putting on lotion and... And give me some real sensuous movement. Loretta, your face has marvelous bone structure. Uh, listen, Joe, bring up the highlights of her cheekbones. No, no, no, no, no. Bring up the highlights. Yeah! There's no realism in this pose. This could just as well be somebody's backyard. Oh, just a minute. I keep trying to play down my high cheekbones and that character wants to me look like a sick Indian. Ooph! Here, at least this will show that one of you is actually going swimming. - Loretta, you put it on. - Why me? Put it on, you'll look fine. Now, now, give me plenty of animation. You're thinking of going into the water and you're protecting your hair. Protecting it? This rubber straightjacket is ruining it! It took me two hours to get it this way. Look, we're not selling shampoo, we're selling Capri swimsuits. Well, who the hell's running this show, you or Jorgensen? Put the cap on if that's what George wants. Put it on. The one thing I can't stand is that damn fag photographer! Oh, relax, Loretta. He's a nice guy. - He's a queer! - Leave him alone. They all hate women, honey, and it shows in every picture they take. That's it. Olive, over there. Let's shoot it. Tani, now give me the whirl. Beautiful. A little more flare with the cape. Good. Okay, uh, just a little more grace. One more whirl. Good. Loretta... Oh, Loretta… Okay, now smile. You're happy. Look, will you smile? Your millionaire boyfriend is out on his yacht and you're waving to him. Hold it, that's sensational. Don't move! You are not photographing me with a goddamn chicken! You loused up a great shot. What you afraid, the bird's gonna look better than you do? With her shooting it, yes. Everybody's tired, George, and we're losing our light anyways, so... Let's start again fresh in the morning, all right? Remember, Jorgensen, don't go using the ladies room. - You bitch! - Forget her, George, forget her. Who is it? It's Jess. Do you always lock yourself in like this? I... I just ran back and slammed the door. I'm sorry. Look, I know it hurt when that female scorpion stung you with her tail, but there's only one antidote, and that's a good stiff drink. We can both use some of that medicine. Thanks. No. Aw, come on, relax, kid. Look, we'll make an evening out of it together, huh? We'll head for the Neptune bar, it's supposed to be really the "in" place around here. What the hell is all this? I'm going back to New York tonight. After what happened this afternoon, I'm afraid I don't belong on this assignment. You belong right here in your job and that's exactly where you're staying. Look, if that broad ever dirty-mouths you again, I'll fire her. I don't want you to fire anyone for my sake. Fine, then let's forget the whole thing and go out and enjoy ourselves. - Jess, it's too late. - You're not letting me down in the middle of an assignment. Jess, you've treated me right. But don't you see? If I stayed here I'd only louse up your project. Well, what about your career, your future? My future? George... You play ball with me, and I'll make you top boy around here. Now... Is that worth throwing away just because some fat-ass broad shot her mouth off? You're too sensitive, kid. So you are different. So what? Everybody says everything about everybody anyway. Most of it's true, so what the hell? Just let it roll off you! What do you mean, most of it's true? Look, all cats are gay in the dark. Good God, you... You don't think I'm one of those? Come on, kid, you don't have to play it straight with me. Jess, you... You've got me all wrong. It's nothing to be ashamed of. It's even legal in most civilized countries. You think of all your great men and artists in history who were that way. Michelangelo. Tchaikovsky. Socrates. Shakespeare. You think Shakespeare wrote all those sonnets to a dame? Even Julius Caesar. Do you know what Suetonius wrote about him? "He was every woman's man "and every man's woman." Jess! - I'm your pal. - Let's keep it that way. Please, other men have tried, Jess. Please, Jess, please... Is this what you mean about my career? Is this what you mean about my future? You didn't mean my future, you meant your own. Damn you! You think you can walk out on me now? You took all the bricks I could give you? A job, a bonus... Thought you'd play me for a sucker? Well, it's the other way around. No, Jess! Jess, no... Jess, no, please! Jess, no! Jess! Jess, no. Please leave me alone! Argh! George? George... If you're going fishing, I can cut bait. What are you doing here? Well, we are not all like Loretta, you know. Go back. Maybe it would help you to talk... Tani, stay out of it. Well, after all, we can't level with our parents. If it isn't safe to confide in your friends, who else can we talk to? Except strangers. George, I've been at the end of my rope, too. We all get there, you know, even though we don't show it. Things are never what they seem. And what do they seem? Well, you can't tell me that they're any better down there than they are up here. I've heard of people jumping off of buildings and bridges because they had nothing to live for. But you've got talent. With a camera in your hand, you're as good as anybody, better maybe. You know the right things to say, don't you? No fishing? No fishing! I'm going back to New York tonight. Somebody else will have to finish this job. Well, what was it, Jess Evans? Didn't you know that he was gay? - How could I? He, he never... - He puts on a good act. I like you, Jorgensen. Because when you cry in your beer, you do it where nobody else can see you. I wish you had a camera you didn't need. What for? So I could shove it down Jess' throat. Tani, I want you to believe me. I'm not like Jess. I knew that when you came tearing out of that motel. It wasn't just Jess I was running away from. I was running away from myself, too. I think I've been doing that all my life. You know, when I was a kid in school I remember reading a poem by Edgar Allan Poe. "From childhood's hour, I haven't been as others were "I haven't seen as others saw "I couldn't bring my, my passions from a common spring" The next few months were spent in the public libraries in a desperate search of my real identity. I was sure my problem was not homosexuality. But the endless research did nothing to help my mental anguish. Just as I was about to give up, I came across an entirely different theory. SEX AND THE GLANDS For centuries, we've been imprisoned by our ignorance and prejudice in the matter of sex. Today we endocrinologists are beginning to learn that a person's whole identity is determined by his glands. His glands. You new students take note. Sex is chemistry. Sex is chemistry. This monkey proves it. Now, now... Eh, Maggie? You know we're not going to hurt you. What you are witnessing is abnormal behavior for a female. Here, here, here, Maggie, this should win you over. Several months ago, Maggie's behavior pattern was that of a typical prepubescent female. Gentle, affectionate, submissive. Hmm. Uh, now after being injected with male hormones, she has developed both the psychological traits, and to some extent the physical aspects, of a male. Her breasts remain undeveloped, the, uh... Her muscles have grown bigger, the clitoris longer. As medical assistants, it will be your job to record all such changes. Tomorrow I'll demonstrate how such records are kept. See you then. Oh, we'll continue where we've left off today. Come on, Maggie, here, yup! Whoa! Professor Estabrook... - Can I help? - Oh, Jorgensen, you still here? Here, thank you. Now, can I help you? You already have, Professor. I, I've read all your books and all your papers and the medical journals. You have? I'm flattered. Young men who are studying to become medical assistants aren't usually so dedicated. Well, Professor, as a matter of fact, I'm a photographer. So am I, it's one of my favorite hobbies. Now, shall we discuss cameras? Or what? Ever since I enrolled in your course, I've wanted to talk to you about your book. Sex and the Glands. Well, that's more than most of my colleagues are willing to do. Ohh... Always resistance against new theories. It's hard to believe that in this day and age there are still people who think "gland" is a dirty word. Professor, I want to be completely honest with you. I came here to learn. To learn about myself. At a school? Well, wouldn't it be simpler to consult a physician? I did. I got nowhere. - Or a psychiatrist? - I went to two of them. They couldn't help me. That's why I turned to your book. Are you trying to tell me you have a... sexual problem? I've always felt that my instincts and all my impulses are... Are female. So... Of course we can know nothing without a blood test. Roll up your sleeve. Within a week we'll have a report back from the laboratory. Then we may have some indication of whether you're suffering from a fixed idea or a glandular abnormality. Did you have this problem before puberty? As far back as I can remember. George! What are you doing in your sister's clothes? And my lipstick? They're Dolly's old clothes, she doesn't need them. Come here. You mustn't do this again. Please? Not ever again. Why, Mom? Why shouldn't I? Because I say so. Now look, we are going to get out of these clothes, get back into your own. Your father will be home soon and I want you to be all ready for him and for dinner. Your school record show that the GI Bill paid your tuition. I was drafted. Yet the army gave you an honorable discharge. How can man who thinks of himself as female have gone through basic training? I learned to hide my emotions, Professor. I didn't go through basic training. I staggered through it. Hup! All right, let's go, up and over the top. Hustle, hustle, hustle, move it! Move it up! Hup! Move it! Argh! Move it up, move it up. Come on, Jorgensen, get your ass up that hill. Let's go! On the double! Come on, hurry it up! You look like you got molasses up your butt. Come on! Jorgensen, what the hell is the matter with you? Report to the CO. You're gonna fight this war behind a desk. Oh, Jorgensen. I have some interesting results for you from that blood test we had made. The uh… Your estrogen level reads 96 rat units. Professor, what does that mean? Chemical imbalance. Your glands are secreting far more female hormones than male. Three times higher than ever expected in a normal man. Then I was right. It isn't just in my mind. No. It's in your glands, in your blood. And, and probably in every cell of your body. You're... You're a woman, trapped in a body of a man. Is there anything that can be done for me? In our country, no. But there is a doctor in Denmark who has been doing very advanced research in this field. You may find the answer to your problem there but, please, you must take the time to think about it. Professor, I've had my whole life to think about it. Will you tell me the name of that doctor now, please? The man you would see is Dr. Viktor Dahlman of the Serum Institut in Copenhagen. Oh, George, for Pete's sake. How long does it take to put on a tie? Well, it never seemed this difficult before. - Oh! Dolly... - Excuse me. Good Lord, George, you're taking enough for a whole year. Mom, you can't photograph all of Denmark in a week. You going to have room for this? A little, uh, going away present, something you can use. With my finances, I can use anything. Dad! A light meter like this costs a fortune. Well, if your book of photographs on Denmark didn't do it justice, no Jorgensen would ever talk to you again. Well, I promise you. Denmark will never look better. Ah, you see, Mother? I told you we'd be proud of our son someday. - Oh! There's Jack with the car. I'll get it. You know, I really will miss all of you. Are you certain about all this? Are you sure that you want to go? Well, now this is a fine time to ask that. Oh, but a... A book of photographs... Who would buy a book like that? Mom, if every Jorgensen in the world buys one, I'll be rich overnight. Mom, what is it? I don't know. I should be happy for you. Maybe it's because I don't know when you are going to be coming back. Mom... It's something I have to do. This book will give me importance. Mom, I have to be somebody. And all this time I thought you were. Oh! Well, I'm glad you're going to be staying with Aunt Thora, at least you won't be lonely. Hey, come on you two, hurry up in here. We've all got to get out of here or we're gonna be late. You hear that, Jack? He's trying to get rid of me. Son, I always knew that the time would come when you'd have chance to stand on your own two feet. Don't worry about the trunk, I'll make sure it gets there. You miss that boat, George, you gonna have one long swim. This is one boat I'm not going to miss. Copenhagen Well, George, how do you like the land of your ancestors so far? Oh, it's wonderful, Aunt Thora. Why, I can almost picture Hans Christian Andersen coming out of any one of those doors. Well, the buildings are old. But we Danes are always young. Here... We have a saying... You will never grow old if you know you are going to dance at your own funeral. I even know the music I want. Aunt Thora... Wouldn't it be simpler for you if I stayed at a hotel? My sister's son staying at a hotel? I have the guest room all ready for you. What good is a guest room without a guest? My house isn't much, but the roof doesn't leak and the wind can't get in. - You will like it here. - Aunt Thora... I think we'd better have a little talk first. Oh? Well, come in, George. George. Don't you think you should have told your parents the truth? I didn't want to worry them. But I had to tell you, Aunt Thora. It just wouldn't have been fair. I know. And your parents don't. That is a big responsibility. And a book of photographs... That was a lie, too? No. That part's true. I have to make money to stay here. Of course you do. I, uh... I lost her 19 years ago. My daughter. My parents never told me you were married. I wasn't. Do I shock you? That's another thing your parents do not know. You keep my secret, and I will keep yours. - Fair exchange. - Ah! If she could talk, the secrets she could tell. You know what the first rule of successful dressmaking is? No. Dress every lady like a whore, and every whore, like a lady. I, uh... I think we'll get your luggage now, huh? Come. Copenhagen Seruminstitut "The Creation of Eve" by Michelangelo Mr. Jorgensen? - Please sit down. - Thank you. Dr. Dahlman will be with you in a moment. Mr. Jorgensen is waiting for you, Doctor. I've seen your medical history. It's very complete. Estabrook's a good man. Too bad he wasn't allowed to help you. Denmark was a long way for you to come. A real hardship, I'm sure. I appreciate your research on this, Dr. Dahlman. Ah! It should've been done in your country, too. You Americans... You're advanced in so many ways, but when it comes to sex... Childish. Operate on the brain, perform a lobotomy. Fine. But take a pair of testicles and everybody explodes. I want you to look at this. - Do you read Danish? - No, sir. Well, this application must be signed before anything can be done for you. Wait. Before you sign anything, I want you to know exactly what I would have to do to your body. Follow me. I want to confront you with the facts. Male. Female. And this is where you are. The operation will be performed in three major steps. First step, an incision is made in your lower torso. Through this, the testicular tissue of the male hormone producing glands would be removed. Next step, we would perform a penectomy. It would be more than a complete castration. And now we come to the most complex and difficult part of the operation. Besides myself, it would require a urologist, a gynecologist and a team of plastic surgeons. Here we will create the vulva, the external part of the female sexual organs. Then, a vagina would be created in your body. If the operation is successful, you could have normal female sexual relations. Even the bodily structure would change. Hips, and breasts would develop through injections of female hormones. Even the bodily distribution of hair would change. And that is how you would remain for the rest of your life. There's no turning back. You understand, of course, that we have never performed this operation before. Our work has only been experimental. You would be a... guinea pig. Sit down. And you realize that there is always a chance for failure. Your future might be at stake. My reputation might be at stake also. Well, do you still want to sign the application? You have courage. You're going to need it. We re both going to need it. Making photographs for my proposed book filled my time while I was waiting to hear if my application would be accepted by the Serum Institut. After two weeks of waiting, I was notified that my application had been accepted, and I was to enter the hospital the next day. I felt I would need all the help I could get. Knife. Hemostat. Sponge. Hemostat. Another hemostat. Sponge. Come on, sponge! Tie! Sissy! Sissy! Sissy! Sissy! Sissy! Sissy! Georgette! Georgette! Georgette! Following the operation, I thought of that dream constantly. It could have only one meaning. George Jorgensen was gone forever. I was somebody else now. From a proud aunt to her niece. Aunt Thora, - you've done so much already. - Ah! Open it! It's beautiful. Look inside. My daughter wore it. A long time ago. Aunt Thora... Would you mind if I took the name of your daughter? It would be... like having her with me again. For the next 18 months, I had to return to the hospital on a prescribed schedule for injections of female hormones under Dr. Dahlman's supervision. Progress Statistics: Reaction to surgery satisfactory. Progress normal. Administration of estrogen begun. In time, the structure of my body and the secondary sexual characteristics began to change. The hips widened and the breasts became female in appearance. Breast development responding to estrogen treatments. Measurements in past-puberty stage. Each measurement was recorded photographically, and added to the growing statistical information in my medical file. Breast development near final stage. All organs functioning normally. Progress excellent. Finally, Dr. Dahlman's work was finished and I was ready to begin my new life. My aunt hoped to prepare the way to my new existence after leaving the hospital by having new clothes waiting for me. But the change of sex was not an easy mental transition for me to make. The image in the mirror seemed to be a stranger. A stranger whom I would have to learn to know and understand. Well, if I would say so myself, it fits you perfectly. So, now you will live, Christine. Oh, and let us have some schnapps, huh? To welcome my niece from the new world to the old world. Come. On this broadcast you have heard everything that's happening, from A to Z. But now it seems we'll have to invent a new kind of alphabet, because this little tidbit won't fit into the one we had before. Listen to this. George Jorgensen, Jr., an American ex-GI, has just applied for a passport under the name of Christine Jorgensen, after being changed by Denmark surgeons from a man into a woman. All I can say is these days a fellow never knows what he's gonna get on a blind date. Christine Jorgensen, female impersonator? Allege danish doctors converted a he into a she-or is it a he-she? Claim sex operation changes ex-GI into blonde beauty. We give up - What is it? Hey, guys, you wanna hear Christine's theme song? * Now I'm a girl * Just like the girl * That married dear old da-a-ad! * I got to tell you something. The other day I ran into a friend of mine, and I noticed he's, walking kinda funny, you know like... Your coffee's getting cold, George. Maybe you'd feel better if you went to work tomorrow. The men there are my friends. What can I say to them? - Hi, Mama. - Oh, hello, darling. - Pastor. Hi, Jack. - Hi, Mom. You picked a bad time for a visit. Jack and I thought it was a good time. Don't expect one of my better sermons, George. It's hard enough to come up with a whopper on Sundays. Been doing my praying right here. It hasn't done any good. - Some coffee, Pastor? - Uh, thank you, Florence. - I'll help you, Mom. - Thanks, Jack. If your new daughter is happy, you should be thankful. Remember, she's still the same person looking at you through the same eyes as before. Neither of us really know that, do we? Are you going to let the world end right in that chair? I've heard people talk like that when a loved one died, George. You haven't lost anyone. I had a son, Pastor. George was never a boy, Dad. You just wouldn't believe it. He was your brother. But what is he now? It's always more difficult for men than for women to accept these problems. In all my years in the clergy, I've found this to be true with mentally retarded children, cerebral palsy, and all of the other afflictions man has been plagued with. I wish I could feel the way you do, Pastor. George, will you come to church next Sunday? Can you change my son back to what he was? So that he can be the man you want him to be? Instead of a woman he had to be? Let it ring, Aunt Thora. It will just be some other newspaper, or God knows what. Sooner or later, they will get tired. Hey, Jorgensen. We want a story! Enough is enough! Get away from the door or I will call the police! Ah, we're wasting our time. Let's go! Well, maybe they don't believe we have police in this country. Let me take care of it, Aunt Thora. Perhaps you didn't hear my aunt the first time. I just got here. Would you mind repeating it once more for me? You're Christine Jorgensen. Well, those wire photos really didn't do you justice. - Please, let me close this door. - No, wait. No, wait now. You want me to go all the way back to the United States just to tell my friend, Professor Estabrook, that you wouldn't even talk to me? - Come in, please. - Thank you. If a friend were coming here, Professor Estabrook would've written me. Okay, I'm afraid I'm a pretty bad liar, Miss Jorgensen, uh... I only met the Professor once. But would it help if I say that Maggie, the professor's chimpanzee, sends her regards, too? - Who are you? - I'm Tom Crawford. I'm a writer for Globe magazine. When I interviewed the professor in his laboratory, he seemed to think I could do you some good. Aunt Thora... So far she has only heard from those who want to do themselves some good. - Mr. Crawford, my aunt, Miss Petersen. - Miss Petersen. I must tell you, Mr. Crawford, that we do not look too kindly on newspaper people at the moment. Don't put all the blame on the press. When you submitted your medical file for a new passport, a clerk in the office made duplicate copies of your photographs and sold that information for $200. Not very high price, is it? The damage has been done. Mr. Crawford, how could you possibly help Christine? Up till now, the papers have only printed their version of your story. Now, I'm not interested in that, nor is Globe magazine. Are you interested in telling your side of it? Or you have something against the truth being printed? Would you believe the truth if you heard it, Mr. Crawford? Miss Jorgensen, may I tell you something? I came here with an open mind. Now, if you're gonna start closing it, I can't help you. Believe me, you need someone on your side. It's so hard to know the ones to trust now. All right, I can't say that I blame you for that. The papers have really been rough on you. But if I wanted to do to you what they did, I didn't have to come all the way to Denmark to do it. It's starting again. Maybe you've got something to tell, and maybe you haven't. Let's just say we'd both be taking a chance. I really don't have much of a choice, do I? That thing! No peace, no peace at all. So long as they know where you are, they will never leave you alone. Over the next six weeks, with Tom staying at a nearby inn, my aunt's lakeside vacation cabin became the one place where we could escape from the newspapers. Aren't you two even going to stop for lunch? Christine's been giving me so much food for thought lately, I haven't had a chance to get hungry. Well, maybe you better try something a little more substantial. Everyone's written to me, except my father. You must be patient. It takes nine months for a child to be born. It may take him that long to get used to a new one. Uh, cafe at my hotel's not bad. Would you like to have a drink? We can talk there. It doesn't make any difference, Tom. Why don't you tell me some of those things about your father that you avoided before? I've already hurt him enough, Tom. Meaning there are some things you haven't even told him. Yes. Chris, why didn't you try them out on me? I don't know. You still don't trust me. Is that it? I'm sorry, Tom. Yes, I trust you. I have to. But this isn't easy to tell anyone. It never seemed like anybody's business but my own. I tried to be everything that my father wanted me to be. I tried everything I knew. I didn't have any choice. I wanted his love. You were a kid, and you wanted a father's pat on the head. Chapters 1 through 5. Okay? But now we're up to Chapter 9, the adult years. You still waiting for that pat on the head? Maybe I am. I know that one of the proudest moments of his life was when I was accepted into the army. It wasn't quite that simple. Judas, Judas, Judas! Don't, I'm ticklish. - Your soap's hanging! - Oh, wise guy! Hey, Georgie, what are you gonna do with your leave tonight? Look, why don't you join us in town, huh? - What's he gonna do in a whorehouse? - Line up with the rest of the girls, what else? - You guys enjoying yourselves? - Hey, Georgie... Okay, knock it off. Knock it off. Now look, George, come on. You can shut them up yourself. Just tell them that you're gonna come with us, okay? - Yeah, Georgie. - Come on with us. Why should I pay for something that… That I can get for free? Why don't you get us some of that free stuff, huh? - That's because he ain't got any! Okay, Jorgensen. You really loused yourself up in this outfit. Come on, let's take off. Wait a minute. I'll go with you. - Well, come on. - Come on, Georgie! Well, hello, baby. Well, come on. I ain't got all night for a 10-spot. Have you got the 10 bucks? Yeah. Here, keep it. You don't have to do anything for it. Hey, this your first time? Wanna smoke? Don't you do anything? Well... Beginner's luck, baby. You're in good hands. Just leave everything to Angela. Well, come on, boy. Don't you want something to brag about? So far it's easy, eh? Nothing to it. Just like going to bed every night. Only this time, you got company. And believe me, you won't hate yourself in the morning. It's no use. Hey... There are men and there are women, sonny. There's a reason they're supposed to get together. Beginning to the idea? Let yourself go, honey. You came in here a boy... You'll go out a man. And that's what every woman wants. A real man. No, don't! Hey... No guy has ever said no to Angela before, baby. No! I can't. Don't you understand, I... I just can't. Please... Just let me stay here for just a little while so... So the guys... So that the guys will think... What do you expect me to do? Hold your hand and holler, "Help, you're hurting me"? Holy Mother! Is that the kind of army we got now? How are we ever gonna win the war? It really wasn't that funny. Was it? I suppose if it comes under the heading of "truth." Put it in the article if you want to, Tom. And you can still smile? I'd like to write about that, too. Aunt Thora will be wondering what happened to us. We'd better get back to lunch. Do you think this is the right type of dress? I think it looks great! The magazine wanted something with a little sophistication in a natural setting, for the front cover. Now, let's see... Hey, right here, with the sunlight coming through the branches. That's great, that's great! Let the public see you smile. That's nice! You really look beautiful. Now, for a little more human interest. Hey, how about a shot with you and your aunt together? Oh, me? I stopped being interesting years ago. Not to us. Come on, Aunt Thora. How's this? - That's perfect, hold it. - Oh, but just wait! Uh, would you mind if an amateur makes a suggestion? I would like a picture of the two of you, uh, for my photograph album. - I have no objections. - Good, give me the camera. Over here. All right, there, that's fine. Closer! Closer, I can't get you both in the picture. Hold still now. - Now, let's have... - That's enough for today, Aunt Thora. Apparently, you had some objection to that last picture. I'm sorry, Tom. We've become very good friends. I... I like being with you but... But I'm only supposed to write about you, not think about you. Christine! Christine! Help me with the flowers, would you, dear? Uh, the vase is over there. When are you going to give Tom a set of the photographs? He doesn't need them for the articles yet. Is that why he has not been here in the last few days? He has all of his notes. I... I thought he could concentrate much better at his place. Oh? I thought you two were working so well together. It's better this way. Does Tom think so? Aunt Thora, Tom has a job to do, that all. Hmm, it must be my eyesight is getting bad. I could have sworn I saw more than that. I must get new glasses. Tom has his life and I... And I have mine. What is yours? Child... You have a right to love a man. I am going back to Copenhagen this afternoon. Christine. This is a decision you must make for yourself. But you must remember, never throw away a chance for happiness too quickly. It can get to be a habit. Jorgensen Story. The Adult Years -- 1952-1953 "The summer is over, and there are still chapters left to be written and questions answered". Who is it? Tom. Uh, I was just about to go to sleep. Yeah, I'm sorry to come at such a late hour, but... Well, for a writer, I'm not doing very much writing these days. Well, I... I had to decide a lot of things by myself. Too much time has passed, Chris. The magazine can't wait any longer. Tom, I don't want to finish the articles. Oh. Well, that news doesn't surprise me. I should've never let you begin them in the first place. It... It was a mistake. Then where does your story end, Chris? The articles might only make things worse. I don't want to hurt my family anymore. It has to be this way, Tom. Don't you understand? Everything ends here. I'm not going back to the United States. Well, hiding here is not going to win you any friends. Tom, please go back to New York without me. You're not afraid of facing your family, you're afraid of becoming involved. I can't mean anything to you. Or anyone else. Are you gonna spend your whole life being afraid of the dark? If I have to, yes. Tom... The dark is either empty or... Or full of things we can't see. That's right, Christine. Stay where it's nice and safe. Where you don't have to take any chances. Listen to me. Do you think it's so impossible for me to love you? I'm sorry, Tom. - I didn't want this to happen to either of us. - Why? Don't you believe you're a woman? Does it make any difference what I believe? Are you going to stop reading the newspapers? Are you going to stop listening to the radio? Or watching television? Will they ever stop making jokes? They'll never stop laughing. Tom... It will destroy you, and it will destroy me. You think I haven't thought about that? We shouldn't expect it to be easy. We're grown up, Chris. We're not kids. Tom, I think it's best that you leave right now. All my life, I've... I've had to love something, a doll, or... A camera. Tom, I need your love. But now, it's... It's not possible. Things are going to be what you make them. Chris, stop being afraid. In the spring of 1953, Christine Jorgensen returned to the United States, and I accompanied her. The derision of an unfriendly public was waiting. Christine, how about a statement? What are your plans for the future? Come on, Christine, smile pretty. The GI's need new pin-up pictures. Hey, Christine, is it true you're gonna re-enlist in the WACs? What's the matter? Aren't you gonna talk? The only happy note was in the unexpected appearance of Christine's family. Darling, are the men in Denmark just as broad-minded about sex as the doctors? - You'll have to find that out some place else. They're not gonna tell us anything. Hey, Mr. Jorgensen, how does it feel to have a daughter instead of a son? Yeah, she got a man. Why don't you ask her how she did it? Boys, what about that? You want a new woman, you can always order one from Copenhagen. Prejudice against the clinical approach to sex problems made it impossible for the public to accept what Christine and science had accomplished. It took 13 years for the laughter to end. On November 21st, 1966 the New York Times printed a startling statement. "Johns Hopkins becomes first U.S. hospital to undertake program of sex change through surgery" Thousands of human beings afflicted as Christine Jorgensen was have been given a normal existence through surgery. I had written the end of Christine's story many years before... But now for her... This was the beginning. English subtitles: Cinegayorg & Leonnos
