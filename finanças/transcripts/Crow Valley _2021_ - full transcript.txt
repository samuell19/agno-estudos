No. No, no, no. No, just stay away from me! Stay away from me you bitch! So you wanna come? - Where? - Crow Valley. Ah, no dude, I'm all right. What about you, are you're gonna be up for it? I feel good. Hey, give us a quick smile, would you? What are you doing? Beautiful. That'll get you some likes on Instagram. Fair enough. Not bad. Whoo! Whoo-hoo! Shit. Fuck me. Hello. Hello? Ah, Jesus Christ, it hurts like shit. I thought you were gonna die. What happened? - You don't remember? - No. I found you on the side of the road. - Where am I? - My uncle's cabin. - I've gotta call an ambulance. - There's no reception. What? Yeah, look, I've tried, there's nothing. Fuck! - I gotta get outta here? - We can walk, but you don't look that good. Look, my uncle, he'll be here in a couple of days, and he'll have a car, so we could just wait. At least we're gonna have to, we've gotta do something about my arm, right? It's parked so kinda have to reset it, and we're gonna have to bandage it up. Shouldn't you just wait for a doctor? Yeah, let's wait for a doctor, and in the meantime, I can fucking bleed to death. Jesus! Fuck! For fucks sake. Listen, if there are any bandages, or a clean bedsheets or anything like that. I'll check. Okay, okay, so you're gonna grab my wrists, and then on the count of three you're gonna pull it. Ready? On the count of three. One. Two. Three? That worked, that worked. You doing the folding? Yeah. You don't usually do it. Well, kind of relaxing. That's not how we do socks. It's how I do the socks. - Here, let me do it. - It's just the folding. It's fine, I can do it. If you're gonna do it, you need to do it properly, so let me show you how we fold socks. I don't need you to show me how we fold socks. Well, you weren't doing it right. What, and you're way is right? - You seem a bit tired. - Are you fucking kidding me? I beg your pardon? You're just such a control freak. Stop being so dramatic. How about you just stop ruining my life? You are driving me crazy. Fucking debacle, fuck! Hi. Hi, how are you feeling? I've been better. You look a little better. Still look like shit though. I'm sorry for screaming at you. I just lost my shit. It's fine. Well, I'm gonna try and be a lot nicer from now on, okay? That'd be great. I am Benny by the way. Benny, right, I'm Greta. Nice to met you, Greta. So are you from around here? No, I'm just down here, hiking. Oh Jesus, now you're stuck looking after me. Best hiking trip ever, eh? Yeah, it hasn't really gone to plan. Sorry about that. Well, I couldn't really leave you on the side of the road, could I? You could have. Not everyone would have done what you did. I guess I was just trying to do the right thing. Appreciate it. Now if there's anything out there, if there is just give me a fucking break. Just once, even though I don't deserve it. Just me a break. Are you taking your medication? Ah, yes. I found this on the floor. So? Are you taking your medication? I asked you a question. Can you just get off your phone for just a minute? Yes, I said, yes. Well, then how did this get on the floor? I don't know, I must've dropped it. - How? - I don't know. Are you lying to me? Can you just get out of my room? I am so sick of trying to help you. You throw everything back in my face. You're just like your father. He was stupid too. Why would you say that? You're gonna end up just like him. I'd rather be like him than like you. Well, good luck with that. - You can be stupid together. - I hate you. I'm done with you. I'm done with everything. I hope you like beans. Yeah, who doesn't love beans? Well, it's the only in the cupboard, so you better get used to it. Hey, I've been thinking, we can still walk out of here, you know? - What? - I'm feeling a lot better. You probably just collapsed, and then I'd have to drag you back here. Come on, it'd be easy. Yeah, but is it smart? Greta, there is absolutely nothing keeping us here. All right, well, what if we got halfway, and then you can't walk any further, what are we supposed to do then happen? That won't happen. Have you seen yourself? You're literally limping around like a zombie. We're you just gonna sit here, are we? I'm just going to sit here and do nothing. Yes, we are. Okay, what about this? You'll walk back to the store by yourself, - I stay here, simple. - It's miles. It'll probably take me at least two days, and then by the time I get there, my uncle will already be here. You got here in one? Yeah, because I got a lift. - You got a lift? - Yeah. - You hitchhiked here? - Yes, I hitchhiked. Yeah, I was wondering how you did that. Well, there you go. God, this is so frustrating. Come on, cheer up. At least you've got beans. Yeah, beans. I gotta stop this. - Bitch. - Bitch. You're a bitch! Stupid bitch. Welcome to guide and meditation. Find a space where you're comfortable. When you're ready to focus on your breathing. Thoughts may enter your mind, let the come and go. Feel your breathe enter your body. Who are you? What are you doing here? Get up you piece of shit. Come on, get up. It gets to me. It was a dumb idea. Greta, I found a car. What? I mean, I guess we could jump start it, but I don't know how to jumpstart a car. Greta, did you know this was here? No. I don't know how you could've missed it. I mean, if you dragged me to the cabin. What are you saying? How did you not see this? I came in the other way, and I was kinda busy saving your life. - Is it your car? - No! - Well, who's is it then? - I don't know. - Is it your uncles. - How am I supposed to know? How am I supposed to know? It's just, I don't know how he could not have seen this. Well, I didn't. Is it your car? No. But this doesn't make sense. Are you calling me a liar? It's just a whole bunch of shit right now that isn't really adding up, so, you know, if you can enlighten me as to what the fuck is going on that'd be great. There's a fucking car here. Jesus Christ, as if you did not see this shit! Look, I saved your life and this is the shit I get? Greta? Greta? I fucking knew it. I'm fucking stupid! I'm so stupid. Shit, shit. Get away from my car! Get away from my car! It's over, champ, it's done. It's finished, whatever you're trying to do here, done. You need to go back to the cabin. I mean, what's with the fucking baseball bat, seriously. You've lost it. You need to go back to the cabin. I'm gonna go home. No, you're not. Just put the fucking baseball bat down, Jesus Christ. Kill it with a baseball wear, right? Just relax. Hey! You want to play games you piece of shit? Well, I can play games. Greta, what are you doing? - Let me go. - Not gonna happen. You hit me with a baseball bat. You could have killed me. I know I could have. Listen, do you want money? I can get you some money. Have you ever seen the movie "Avenging Angel?" No. When I was in grade five, I went to a sleep over at my friend Abby's house, and her mom and dad just split up, so her mum basically let her watch anything. What are you? Fucking, you're talking about a movie. I'm fucking taped to a chair. Anyway, so this movie is about this cheerleader who gets raped by these drunk frat guys, so she tracks them down, and she kills them one by one. But the kicker is before she kills them, she cuts their dicks off, so the police find all these bodies, but they never find any of the dicks. Well, I never raped anyone. No, I know. You're missing the point. The point is I'm the avenging angel. Let me go. Fucking, let me fucking go! Let me go, let me go! Let me fucking go you fucking, stupid fucking bitch! Are you finished? What's your real name? What are you gonna hit me with it? Look fuck you up, fuck off. Last chance, what's your real name? - Tell me. - Put it away. - Greta, put it away. - What's your real name? Put the fucking hammer away. What's your real name? Greta, put it away. Put it away, whoa, whoa! Stop, stop! Fuck! It's David. It's fucking David Stonehouse, all right? Can we go home now? Have a fucking cup of tea. Are you kidding me. What am I doing? You okay? Guess what? That should help. One more question. Who am I? Go fuck yourself. Come on, it's not that hard if you think about it. I'll hit you again. - I will. - I know. I know who you are. You're friend, or a relative, or just some free I read about in the newspaper. And this is my sister. Olivia, you got big. Why didn't you help her? I thought she was dead. You knew she was alive and you just left her to die. No, you're wrong. You left her on the side of the road. So what, you kill me and that fixes everything? Fucking crazy, fuck. She deserves justice, and so do I. There is no such thing in this universe as justice. You kill me and your sister's still dead. Will that feel like justice? No. You, you go to jail. Will that feel like justice? No, it won't, and believe me, Olivia, jail is the last place you wanna go. You're gonna tell me the truth about what happened. You know the truth. Give that a go. In there? That's good, but I'd be getting it to a mechanic as soon as possible. - Oh, thank you, Heeps. - Welcome. - So what's Hannah like? - Why would you care? I don't know. She was funny. Hannah and I used to play hide and seek with my toy, Bunny Booboo, Hannah used to go with find and seek, and I'd look for Booboo while she made these founding noises. The closer I got, the louder the found, so I used to think she was the funniest person ever. God, Danny and I, Jesus. We used to fight just, we used to fight so much. Who's Denny? Den's my sister. David and Denny. Is she still alive? Yeah, Den's still around. Ain't you lucky? Yeah, well, we don't talk much anymore anyway. After the court case, I lost Booboo. I couldn't find him anywhere. I looked all over the house, and I decide to look in the garage. I opened the door. I found my dad hanging himself from the roof, mom came running in. and she saved him. We don't really talk either. Hi, honey. You know I'm going up the cabin for a couple of nights. No, I did. I told you yesterday, Oh! Ah, what caught me say it on that. Look, look, what if I'm back Tuesday morning? Yep, now I promise, promise. Well, yeah, yeah, I always leave at clean. You know that, I'll do it clean before I leave, and I'll be back, 11 AM Tuesday. All right, love you, love you. Bye. Olivia, I am so sorry. I'm sorry for what happened your family, and God knows I am sorry for what happened to Hannah. - I know why you're doing this. - You don't know anything. I understand why you're angry. I would be too. I would be furious. How fucking insightful. You leave my sister to die, and then you figure out why I'm angry. - I checked her pulse. - No, you didn't. You would have felt something. I didn't know what I was doing. Yeah, you're full of shit. That's easy to do. You check someone's pulse and it's so soft. You can't feel anything, so you think they did. So you're a doctor now? What a hero you are. I was in prison for three weeks. I was standing in line for the canteen. These three guys walk in, and they are fucking massive. I walk up behind this kid in front of me, and already he wasn't hiding or something. One of them pulls out a metal bar, just smashes the kid on the back of the head. There's blood everywhere and he goes down, and they just start kicking the shit out of him. They just kick the shit. No one else. Everyone just stands around and watches. So he's in a coma for three days, and then he dies. You know what he was in for? For Parking fines. Fucking parking fines. I thought I could get out of prison instead of pay for him. So that week I signed up for medical course, I know it's not much, but I don't dunno. That night with your sister, if it happened now, I could do something about it, but I just, I didn't know what I was doing back then. I don't know what I was fucking doing. You're acting like this is some be accident. It was a mistake. You were drunk. You drove your car into my sister's bike. That's not an accident, that's murder. It was a mistake. It was a mistake. That was the fucking biggest mistake of my life. I'll give anything to go back and change it, but I can't. I can't go back, and I can't change it, and now I'm just fucking stuck. I'm fucking... I'm stuck in the middle of fucking nowhere, and I'm surrounded by shit and misery, and I can't fucking escape. I can't get out of it. You're so full of shit. You may as well have shot her with a gun. You're a fucking murderer. - Hey Tom. - Hey, good day, Bob. - Hey, how you doing? - Yeah, good, good. I think the dogs are back this year. Yeah, but you've never been a very good judge, have you, Tom? No, no. Not really. Not as a bulldog supporter. Well, anyway, we'll see. - Living up the cabin? - Absolutely. It's the slice of paradise. That's it you bitch! - It's never gonna stop. - Never gonna stop. Leave me alone, leave me alone. Leave me alone. What are you screaming at? There's nothing there, fuck. Leave me alone. What the hell am I doing? There's nothing there. It's all your fault. It's all your fault. Take it easy. It's all your fault. You ruined my life! Come on then. Come on then, let's get this fucking shit over with. If you're gonna do it, do it. - Bitch. - Fucking do it! Come on. Is this your place? Yeah. Look, is there any chance of getting a lift out of here? Who are you? I'm Greta. Fucking shit! - Is that blood on your top? - What? Blood all over your top. Yeah, I just had a recent accident. - You okay? - Yeah, no, I'm fine. What are you doing here? Oh, I was just, this is my first time up here and I just, I got really lost. - And you found my cabin? - Yeah, I was so happy I found this place. look, Is there any chance of getting that lift, I just really wanna go. Yeah, I'm just gonna have a look inside first. - I wouldn't go in there. - What? No, you just don't need to go in there, seriously. - Get out of my way. - No, wait, please wait, - can we just-. - Get out of my way. Please, please. Shit! What the fuck's going on here? Mate, get me outta here. Get me outta here, please. - Jesus. - Why is there so much blood? Why do you think? Help him. Help him! What do I do? You need to stop the bleeding. Get a towel or something. Fold it up like a bandage. Now it's putting pressure on the wound. Nice and firm, okay? Hold on the wound nice and firm. There's so much blood, so much blood. Feel his pulse. Two fingers next to his Adam's apple. - Okay. - Can you feel anything? Mm-mm, maybe. Let me go, Olivia, I can help him. Like you helped my sister. Let me go, please. - You're just gonna run. - Let me go, please. I won't run, let me go! No, you're just saying that, okay. Let me go to a place or he's gonna freeze, he's gonna fucking die. - No. - Let me go! Let me fucking go! I cannot feel anything. I can't feel anything. You killed him. You fucking happy? You killed him. I don't understand. Are you fucking happy now. Fuck me! What a fucking debacle. Fuck! Leave me alone. I hate you when you're fine. Just hitting people with a baseball that isn't exact science. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I fuck everything up. I fucked everything up. Come on. Yes. Okay. Oh, you fucking piece of shit. Fuck! Fuck! Fuck no. Ah! Oh fucking shit. Oh shit. Oh, fuck! Come on, come on. Oh shit! Looking for these, David? Go on then. Stop! What the fuck? It stopped. What are you doing? What'd you do with the knife? Damn, crap. What I want you to do, Olivia, listen to me, what I want you to is hold your hand on the window, okay, can you do that? If you can do that, I can drive the car. Hold it there. Olivia, hold it there. Hold it for me. Come on, just hold it. Leave me alone. - Don't worry about it. - Leave me alone. Here you're all right, that's it. Oh, you're all right. Try and take it easy. What's happening? You're strongest, okay? Yeah, it hurts. Yeah, I know.
