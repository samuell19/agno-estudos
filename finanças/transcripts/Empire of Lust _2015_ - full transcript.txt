CJ ENTERTAINMENT presents a FINEWORKS FILM / KEYMAKER production Executive Producer JEONG TAE-SUNG Year of 1398, 7 years since it was established, foreign intrusion and the issue of proclaiming the crown prince threw Joseon Dynasty into disorder. You dirty mutt! EMPIRE OF LUST YEAR OF 1398 7TH YEAR UNDER KING TAEJO'S REIGN At this time of rebirth when we should be abolishing old customs, the founding contributors cannot continue to possess private armies while also being granted protection by the nation-- doing so will certainly disperse and weaken the nation’s power. Therefore, your majesty, to reunite military strength, we should vest all private armies in the great army and have the battle formation drill proceed without delay. If tens of thousands of soldiers start training suddenly, it would raise suspicion in the Great Ming. We cannot afford that. So does your lordship the first vice-premier put the Great Ming's mood ahead of our own interest? Would you rather this country suffer war? Watch your mouth! How dare you! You all be quiet! We just founded the new kingdom. And already we can’t seem to agree on anything! Your majesty. The supreme commander, Jo Young-gyu, and commander of Right Army, Kim Min-jae, request an audience. Granted. Your humble subject, Jo Young-gyu, completed the mission of subjugating the northern savages. Welcome back! You must've suffered many hardships. Commander of the right army, Kim Min-jae pays reverence to your majesty. I was informed about your distinguished service at this battle. Seeing you brings me great joy as you remind me of myself as a young man. - Lord First Vice-Premier. - Your majesty. Do arrange a celebration for the two commanders who brought us great victory. As you command, your majesty. First call is 20 silver coins, 20 coins anyone? - Twenty! - We have 20! 21 anyone? - 21! - Good, 21 from the gentleman. Anyone calling 22? 22 silver coins! Look who is here! Isn't this Commander Kim who won the deadly battle in the north? How have you been, your highness? Can't be better all thanks to you! The youngest born of my stepmother became the crown prince. Yes, I know. Are you here because of that? I don't understand... I am asking if you're here because you're worried that I, Lee Bang-won might be sad about not becoming crown prince. I heard your father-in-law played a great part in it. How could it be? It is solely his majesty’s decision to crown a prince. I sincerely envy your father-in-law. He shouldn't have any worry with such a strong man like you by his side. Anyway, let's talk more at the feast later. See you soon. Thief! Catch him! Ouch! Please don't! Are you trying to cripple a child for stealing an ornament? He's just a starving child. For you, this is only the means to feed yourself for a few days. but for me, it is the only gift from my estranged mother. So take this instead and buy food with it. And don’t do anything like this again. Do you understand? Everyone has something they hold dear. I apologize for the commotion,my lord. Please forgive my disrespect. Let's go. You met Prince Jung-an. Yes. He pretends to be a toothless tiger but he cannot fool me. He's just hiding his claws, I'm sure. You also know how he can be. From now, you’d do well not to consider him a friend as before. Do you understand? Yes, sir. You will be assigned to be the commander of the great army so you'd better get prepared. But sir... Haven’t I expressed my intent to retire after this battle? The state of affairs doesn't allow you that luxury. The youngest son of the second queen became the crown prince. The reform of the military system is facing opposition, too. We need to use the outside enemy to ease the complaints within. We will attack the east of Liaohe River. All you have to do is follow orders. So, How is your health? Thanks to the medicine you sent, I am much better now. That is good to hear. Get well soon so that you may give birth to this family’s heir. Please don't, Father. I came here today because I wanted to personally deliver something to my son-in-law. - Bring it in. - Yes, your majesty. You may open it. Isn't this? Do you remember it, Lord Sambong? It's a scent bag. It's too precious to give to my grandson. It is tradition for the father-in-law to give this to his son-in-law. You should carry it with you always. Inscrutable are the king's favor, your majesty. Actually, that scent bag is also a subtle message urging the son-in-law to produce an heir. Just so you know! Wait, you shouldn't be here. You must not be late, the celebration is for you! You'd better get going. - Then I shall leave first. - Sure. Let me propose a toast. This drink might help you be more productive tonight. Oh, is that so? Yes, my lord. Oh, you're finally here! How come the star of the night is so late? My apologies, your highness. There were some family affairs. Powerful families surely have lots of affairs to handle! Lord Sambong also couldn't make it. Well, well... Like father-in-law, like son-in-law. How can they not be so preoccupied, when they desperately try to steal everyone else's thunders? You know though, your lordship has only yourself and your laziness to blame! Don't you think? Drink! This is Gahee. She prepared a dance popular in Ming Dynasty for tonight’s feast. Dance has its own artistry and manners. Your lordship should be aware of such things. How dare you wench! Today shall be the death of you! Please forgive her. She hasn't even turned up her hair yet. So please, have mercy. What? She's still a virgin? Good then! Then I'll be her first man. I'd rather die right here than to let it be so. Rather die? I'll teach you manners tonight! Please stop. Do you think me your subordinate, now that you’ve won a few battles and found favor with his majesty? Please stop. I see. You want to be her man too? Alright. We’ll let our swords decide who her man should be. Draw your sword! It is true that I'm the least favorite son of his majesty but how could you make such a scene in front of a royal prince? Your highness, How about having her decide who her man should be? That’s a very good idea! I had such high hopes for tonight... but not only am I ignored because of that girl, you mean to make me see blood! No way! One of your lordships must accept the girl's choice! Aha! I think that clears it up. Why don’t we make a toast altogether to celebrate those two? Hurray! Hurray! Why did you do that? Because you were bleeding. Well... at least it is all past us now. You should rest. I'll be in trouble if you leave me like this. What do you mean? Even here at courtesans' house, a girl who gets deserted on her first night is said to be unlucky and no man comes for her. Stop. It should be enough to show that you were not deserted. I've heard that you are tough and violent. But it seems they were wrong. People say that you kill mercilessly, as if taking a life is easier than lifting a spoon. I just follow the king's order. How can a man have no reservations about taking others’ lives? Stop this nonsense, and take some rest. Mom! Mom! Mom! Do you want true revenge? You really mean to give me that ornament - if I take out the kitten? - Sure. My hand's are too big to do it myself. You will hear the meow. You go in alone. I'll wait outside. Shush! Don't move! - You wench! - Please help! How dare you? Look at him. The girl he raped the other time turned out to be a civilian girl. And she reported him to the district office. You should’ve been careful to target only the lowest class girls! How are we supposed to tell them apart just by appearance? We thought she was a slave because she was dressed like one. Damn it. Shouldn't we be allowed some fun in the kingdom our fathers founded? Why is it so complicated? Well, that happened... so let’s stop this and go back to the red-light district. That’s fine with us, but what about the king's son-in-law, who has the full attention of - his majesty? - Damn it. I never even wanted to be the king's son-in-law. What can you do? It’s your destiny, with such powerful men as your grandfather and father. Speaking of whom... - have you heard the rumor? - What rumor? Well, a rumor has spread that his father popped a courtesan’s cherry last night. Are you serious? I knew it. He pretends to be so serious and dignified... but inside, he’s the same as all other men. You know how I founded this country. Yes, your majesty. Your majesty. I present you that sword because I want you to be tied to me closer than even blood allows. I need you more than anybody else for me and my crown prince. Hence, I abolish the old military system from the previous dynasty and have it restructured as one great army controlling three services. Wield this sword for me by my side. And protect the crown price with it. This is my first request and royal command. And I now name Kim Min-jae, commander of the right army, as the supreme commander of the new great army. I shall obey the command, your majesty. How could he do this to me? To appoint me as the Minister of Culture and Education when I’ve spent all my life in the battle field! This is more than just a demotion! Great. Good. Lord Sambong and Commander Kim Min-jae will have the country under their thumbs! That is not quite right. Kim Min-jae is... only Lord Sambong's dog. What I mean to say is... there’s no one who has contributed more greatly to this kingdom’s establishment than your highness. It makes me so upset to see others but yourself control important state affairs like proclaiming the crown prince. That's right. You need to read the moves. - Just like that! - My lord! I like being like this. I mean it. But your highness! I need to get her service tonight no matter what. Let her in whenever she's ready. But she has already served a man - and only sells her artistry. - Hey! I told you to bring her in. No matter what. Understood. Sir. Look there! What are you doing? Come down quick! Even the lowest of lives have rules to follow, and even a courtesan like I have a heart to keep and protect. If you keep insisting on my service, I will jump off, right here. You think others will care or call you a virtuous woman for dying like this? You'll be remembered as a mad girl who killed herself for nothing. I’d rather be remembered as a mad girl who killed herself than to sell my smiles in the arms of men like you! What? Gahee! Why are you doing this? Please don't. You can't do that. Gahee! My lord! Please don't, sir! Sir! Who can guarantee that something like this won’t happen again? Ever since she became your woman, she rejected all requests from all men and carried this handkerchief in her bosom every day. I plan to send her away as soon as she recovers. How? Well, you are not planning to take her into your custody. She, like all other girls here, can only survive when the bees come for her honey. Scentless flowers have no place here. I’m afraid I must tell her to go find her own way. Are you so pure and innocent that you would trust a man? How dare you, lowly thing, try to drag the Lord down? In the end, this is what you needed. Leave now and do not ever come back unless you want to destroy the Lord's future. I thought of what would be the best for you, my Lord. You bestowed upon me so much kindness, The messenger from Chuihyang-roo. that I have become fond of you. But I am afraid that I might hold you back from great things... So, I send you my heart in this letter before I take my leave. Please, be well. Lady Gahee! Sir. I was wondering about you... You're as beautiful as they say. You’re too generous, your highness. Make yourself at home and be my friend. It’s not much, but I prepared a gift for you. It’s ‘Retired Life’ by Wei Ying-wu. I heard that you are fond of poems, And thought you might enjoy it, despite my humble skills. I don’t often tell people, but I write a little myself. What do you write? Just the small stories of our world. Please take a look sometimes. Yes, your highness. His lordship, King's son-in-law is here. - So she is my father’s... - Yes, sir. Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Gahee. What were you two talking about? You seemed really close. Please take a look. The Noble and the humble are different Yet both are of value-- for each fulfill their roles in life. Then, I will be taking my leave. What do you think? Isn’t it impressive? Yes, it is. Very impressive, indeed. Instead of keeping a low profile and minding your surroundings, You bring a girl into your house! Did you forget that we're the King's in-laws? Such imprudent behavior when you are to be helping the Crown Prince conquer the north! What would your life have been like had I not taken you in? No better than that of wild beasts, I bet, mingling with those filthy barbarians. I even made you my son-in-law knowing that your mother was of barbarian heritage! Do you really think Jin could’ve been the king’s son-in-law if I hadn’t accepted your offer? Are you threatening to reveal that Jin is not your real son? Are you trying to humiliate me using my daughter's flaw? I would never have started all this in the first place had I the slightest intention of breaking my promise to you. What is the meaning of this? Please leave. I never imagined that you could be my father’s concubine. I..I thought you were dead. I almost was... but I survived. You know how wretched lives live and die so arbitrarily. Why did you disappear so suddenly then? Do you know... how desperately I looked for you? Were you really so desperate? Of course. I’m so happy to have you by my side again. Although a concubine, I am your father’s woman now. Do you intend to commit immorality? Please leave. Lady, her highness wishes to see you. Are you done reading? How was it? Interesting. The story of the lord in exile and the courtesan who loves him... It's sad yet beautiful at the same time. Good to hear. Anything else you want to add? - It reminded me of... - Are you inside? I'm sorry. I hope I didn't interrupt your conversation. Not at all. Please come in. Please, go on. When I was at courtesans' house, I heard a similar story like yours from a silk peddler. - You did? - Yes. But that story was different... How different? Tell me. On his way home from exile, the noble man hurts the courtesan, who he fears may hinder his success, and returns alone. Poor thing. Is that the end? Just like that? But that courtesan survives And exacts revenge on the noble man. Really? How? Well... I haven't heard that part yet. He promised to tell me on his next visit. It’s just a story, but I mourn for the girl. I doubt it’s true. - For a man to be so evil... - You’re right. I’m sure it’s a made-up story. But be sure to tell me the ending when you hear it from the peddler next time. I will, your highness. The dead girl came back to life. - Are you kidding me? - Wait! So you're saying the girl you killed for a cover up returned, alive, as your father’s concubine. I thought something was off when you started obsessing over one girl. So unlike you. Damn it! I shouldn’t have let myself be blinded by her beauty. I would be deadly scared if I were you now. Shouldn't you inform your mother about this? No, no. I’ll shut her up for good. Don’t come out! It is dangerous! Who ordered you to do this? - Sir! - Lady! Gahee! Gahee! - Call the doctor! - Yes, sir. Lady... Lady. Assassins at the princess's residence! Who would dare send assassins to the prime commander's house? We do need to find out who did this and make them to pay for their sins. But at the same time, we can't ignore the fact that the servants of the prime commander possessed swords when their master leads to abolish all private armies of the noble. Are you calling the servants private soldiers for raising swords in protection of their master? Discovering who threatened the lives of the prime commander and his family Is the first priority, your majesty. How are we to open an investigation and find the culprit when all the assassins are dead? And servants with swords can't be anything but private soldiers. It would be the right thing for the prime commander to show initiative and vest his servants to the great army. I have but myself to blame for this. I’ll send all the servants related to this incident to the great army, to prevent further issues. I forbid further discussion on this matter. I will strictly reprimand anyone who mentions this incident again. So be it! Isn’t he the prime commander himself? What led you to such humble settings? I came to hunt together as it's been a while. I’d be more than happy to! You're always welcome here. Let it begin! Your skills are as superb as ever. I was just lucky. Everyone here is very nimble on their feet. They learn to be as fast as the wild animals they chase, since they do nothing but hunt everyday. Was it you who sent me the guests, your highness? I’m sorry to hear that you suspect so. Why do you train and harbor private soldiers like this? You misunderstand me... I’m just enjoying myself, hunting animals with these boys. Then please send them to the great army. Why are you trying to set up a large scale military training at a time like this? To unite all the military power of the nation as one army. Are you trying to attack the east of Liaohe River, or are you coveting the throne for the young crown prince? You speak unwisely. Well... you might not understand the real reason for this training. As you are just a henchman of Lord Sambong. Private soldiers are dividing the nation's power... Min-jae. Look here, Kim Min-jae. I want to hear your thoughts, not Lord Sambong’s. Is this man sitting in front of me Kim Min-jae or Lord Sambong, Jung Do-jeon? Are you satisfied with playing Sambong’s right hand man? I don't belong to anyone. I just serve the king and protect the people with my sword. I hope you are speaking the truth. Are you that happy? Yes, I am, sir. I didn’t expect other lords to assist me that much. Lord Ha said... Yes? How could we investigate the dead and who would we blame? I wonder though... who would get rid of the dog's bowl when the dog dies? Of course the owner should... Did you really think it would be as simple as killing a hound by setting some mutts on it, my lord? If they had killed that girl then, do you think you can sit there and have this drink with me? It's quite amusing that your lordship's security depends upon this mad girl’s life. Inscrutable are the workings of Fate. This incident will make things easier for us. Do you know who Kim Min-jae’s mother was? She was a Jurchen geisha. A man naturally longs for his mother's love. Sir, it seems that we are not alone. I know. Your highness surely takes after his majesty, a god of archery! I think it’s about time for the peony to bloom. Lady, a message arrived saying the silk peddler is at the linen shop. - Wait here. - Yes, ma'am. Are you there? Anyone here? What brought you here? We should finish... what we couldn't finish last time. Do you mean something like this? Yes. Now we are talking. Are you aware that such immoral acts are punishable by death? Of course. The one who committed the sin and the counter-part, both get beheaded. That’s why you and I should conspire to survive together. There’s no way out for you this time. No one will come in. Forget the peddler. It was a false message I made up to lure you out. Peddler? What peddler? Did you really believe that story? What do you... I just made it up to entertain the poor princess. We need an excuse to have fun, don't you think? Yes, you're right. Absolutely right. But before you take what you want you need to give me something in return. I will give you... whatever you want. Give me this as a token of your affection. But that is... given by his majesty, the King. It’s a token to show that we both risked our lives. It has to be as valuable as this. Right... Whatever you say. Oh, my... What are you doing? I’m sorry, sir. It is my fault... Did you laugh? Pardon? No, your grace. You laughed at me? Laugh? How dare you? What are you doing? This bastard... he put dirt on my shoe and laughed. It is my fault, sir. You heard him? It is his fault. This old man looked after you like you were his own since you were born. Follow me. Fa..father. Come to the next market. Uncle! Look at this. I got these at dawn and it's still fresh! What do you think? Get up. Try to block me. Get up! Now! Father, it's all my fault! Princess, move aside. I am disciplining my son. Please reprimand me and my lack of virtue for not serving my husband properly. This has nothing to do with you, princess. What is this fuss all about? Sir. He is the king's son-in-law before he is your son. It's really embarrassing to do this in front of all the servants! Your overprotection allows him to abuse his subjects and mingle with vulgar people when he cannot even properly draw a sword! I never wanted to be the king’s son-in-law! What do you want from me? My lord! Do you treat him so because he is not your real son? Do you really think that way? If not, there is no reason for you to overreact like this. I have never considered Jin as anything but my son. The problem lies in you and your presumptions. I didn’t say anything because I know my own mistakes, but it is quite hilarious to hear that from a man who is enthralled by a concubine. I can put up with all else but I will not tolerate your abuse of my son. I hope you don’t forget who it was that allowed you to come this far. I ask... for whose benefit was it truly for? It's Gahee, your highness. May I come in? Please come. I was worried about you. Don't just suffer patiently. Please, tell me your thoughts. No, it's okay. What can I possibly say? So please, I hope you can forget about today too. I will. But since you are here, we shall chat all night. - Have you met the peddler? - Yes. I heard the ending. So what happened to that courtesan? The noble man’s mother heard of the incident and hired a man... Please let me in! The poor girl’s mother who tried to appeal the injustice was hurt. Mother! Mo...mother! The bearer mistook the mother as the courtesan. But how could that happen? Maybe it was Heaven's will. Her mother died for her. How would your highness end this story if it were yours? Well... I cannot think of anything as it is too sad and heartbreaking. Failed again. I really want to be good at archery like you, brother! Your skills should improve rapidly if you take after his majesty. Here comes his majesty, the King. Father! I told you not to come to the palace unless summoned. Why is that? You made me bloody my hands when the situation called for it. But now that it's over, I guess you don't need a son with blood on his hands. How dare you! Please restrain your anger, your majesty. You frightened our precious crown prince. Min-jae. Look here, Kim Min-jae. Are you satisfied with playing Sambong’s right hand man? I hope you don’t forget who it was that allowed you to come this far. You look pensive. What is bothering you? No. I was just thinking about the past. By the way, it's been quite a while since you moved in with me. Did you inform your mother about this? Well... If you have lost contact, I can find her for you. It would not take long if I send out a few people. You cannot find her. Did you spread her ashes in that river? Yes. Lord, please don't... You should have told me sooner! I couldn’t speak of her as it broke my heart. I am sorry. No. I promise now... I’ll protect you. Against any threat. I'll definitely keep you safe. - Lady.. - Stop! What are you doing? Burn everything! Please calm down, sir. It’s dangerous, my lord! I'm sorry. But thankfully it’s just burnt on the edge. I'm sorry for your mother. Why did you do that? It’s your mother’s relics! What am I to do... if you continue being this way? It is already enough that I can do this for you. I’m only sorry that I can’t give you more. I had a dream. What kind of dream? People were gathered and dancing together. There seemed to be no need for drawing one’s sword, no need for hurting others. Everyone just mingled together as equals, enjoying themselves. You and I were there hand in hand smiling at each other. And I felt the warmth of your hand. It is a good dream. Gahee... I can feel your grief. I just want to live with you as we did in that dream. I won’t let go of this hand no matter what. Can you promise the same? Yes, my lord. It’s been a while since we sat down together. Yes, indeed. So what made you come visit this old man? I asked a question to the prime commander when he visited me last, but couldn’t hear the answer. So, today I am here to hear it from you. What is the real reason for the formation training? To build the great Joseon Dynasty by attacking the east of Liaohe River. I think I've heard this story before. What do you mean? The story of a troop who left for Liaohe River but returned to launch a surprise attack against the capital. You’ve gone too far. Are you implying that I have some other goal in mind? No. This way or that way we go, does it make a difference if we could live happily for a century to come? You know what happened the last time I recited this poem to someone? Recently a group has been training private soldiers using hunting and polo as excuses. I believe that we must punish them severely and right military discipline to re-establish order in in our nation. Outlawing hunting and polo for military appropriation would demoralize meritorious retainers and turn them into enemies. Do you mean that you can do whatever you want if you contributed to building the new kingdom? I forbid hunting and polo as of today. Confiscate all weapons and horses used for them. I’m here to deliver his majesty’s order. He ordered all horses but those required for transportation to belong to the great army and also forbid hunting and polo. What did you just say? Forbid what? Hunting and polo. Forbid hunting and polo. What made his majesty so very weak? Can I decide which horse to keep? Yes, sir. Thank you. Look, Min-jae. I only have the one horse left and thus have none more to give out. What to do? Don’t underestimate Prince Jung-an. We can’t stop him this way. At this rate, he might strike back. Then we are the ones in danger! We didn't found this dynasty to be killed by him! I think it's the time. Before we attack the east of Liaohe River we should hit Prince Jung-an first. But when? The timing is crucial. The day of the white monkey. Day of the white monkey. As everyone will be enjoying the feast all night, we can attack while taking advantage of the commotion. They must know it, too. They would not miss this chance to mobilize their army. We can finish everything by afternoon before his majesty wakes up. Do you think we can succeed? It's solely up to the prime commander. Wield this sword for me by my side. And protect the crown prince with it. This is my first request and royal command. Don't forget who raised an animal to be human today. You shall risk your life for me and the king. This is the scent bag that his majesty gave to his son-in-law. The time has almost come for us to carry out our plans. I'll notify you in advance. When your plan is accomplished, not only will Kim’s clan fall, but the entire army of this country will be paralyzed. Then... what would happen to the prime commander? What... do you think? I shall leave as it is already quite late. She is the girl I told you about. Treat this as your mother and your duty from now on. Do not ever forget how your mother died. It's a peony. Engrave it into your memory. Thankfully, it’s just burnt on the edge. No doubt that Prince Jung-an will attack with his private soldiers. He will probably aim for the east gate. Call in troops from outside the city and assign them inside the palace. - You should be fully prepared. - Here it is, commander. I would like to meet you discretely on the day of the white monkey. I knew it. She's no different from the others. Is it the medicine for the princess? Yes, sir. I see, give it to me. I'll deliver it myself. I don't think I can attend the feast as I feel suddenly dizzy. Don't worry. I'll explain to the king so that he doesn't worry. Your highness, Kim Min-jae has started to move. - How long did I sleep? - A bit less than 2 hours. Even the Heavens shall never know what you are about to do tonight. I pay my respects to your majesty and your highness. Where is the princess? She could not come as she is ill. She sends her regards. What a shame, is she very ill? It’s not a serious condition. She seemed to feel dizzy as she is a bit feeble. If sister is very ill, please send her some herbal medicine, your majesty. Sure. Due to that... I would like to return and attend to her... Of course, go ahead. He's such a sweet husband. Any messages from the peony? We just sent the soldiers to the appointed location. - Is everything ready? - Yes, sir. Everything is perfectly prepared. I'll forgive you for what you did last time. However... You shall fulfill your end of the deal today. I hate getting the short end of the stick. I gave you your token, so now you need to give me something in return. I changed my mind. I think I prefer your father since he, at least, is not a complete piece of scum. Scum? Are you crazy? Say that again. Huh? Repeat what you just said with that filthy mouth of yours! This filthy mouth. I shall reap this... Attack! What's the fuss? Go and find out now! Your majesty, your highness, you should shelter yourselves. What are you looking at? Go and guard the king! Stop right now! Your majesty, they plotted treason against you. No, that cannot be true. It is Prince Jung-an who raised the armies! Sambong! How dare you lie in front of the king? Bang-won, how dare you? Your majesty, Kim Min-jae assigned soldiers at the east gate plotting treason against you! It's slander, your majesty! If he is not plotting treason, why are these soldiers inside the palace and not guarding the outer walls, as they should? Lord Sambong and Kim Min-jae plotted to kill me and other lords who found out about the adultery of Kim Jin, their heir and your majesty’s son-in-law. What are you talking about? Who’s having an affair with whom? How could I believe you, telling me my son-in-law committed adultery? Your majesty, I have undeniable proof. Bring them in! Here are the accused! Princess! Father! I declare the end of the feast. Imprison the sinners and the rest of you... return home! How could such a thing happen? Whose letter is it? Lady Gahee told me to give this to your highness at 9 PM. You will find out how the tale ends if you come to the warehouse now. Wife! Don't! I will listen to what she has to say. My dear, I...I just... that bitch seduced me... Her state doesn't look like that of a seducer. So tell me, why did you make me find out? Can your highness forgive the husband who cheated you and stay with him all your life? How dare you? I can put you to death if I talk to his majesty, the king. I do not wish for my own life. But I didn't want to harm Lord Kim and this was only solution I could come up with. Please understand this. I do not care about myself, but Lord Kim...please save him. Who are you? That's all I know. I knew Bang-won was up to something... We should’ve never given him the opportunity. That is why I put my faith in you and asked for your protection. Is this your answer to my sincere request? Kill me, your majesty. I will spare your life as the princess requested. But you will have to kill the girl discretely within the night. Why are you silent? Do you intend to defy a royal command? Are you trying to put me and the crown prince in danger by giving them an excuse to overthrow us? Kill the witness! It is the royal command! So it was all planned from the beginning. Did you truly use me to take revenge for your mother? Tell me. The truth will not make a difference now. You know too well that even if I were to deny it all, it’s too late to change anything. Do you really want me to kill you? If I were afraid of death, I would not have started at all. If I have sinned, It would be that I was born a low-class peasant girl and survived. How can it be a sin? It is for a wench like me. Because I am not even human in their eyes. This country values a cow more than three peasant lives. Nobody is punished for raping and killing a slave girl, but you die if you rape your father's concubine. You mean during all those times that we shared together... you never loved me? Not even for a moment? I died when my mother died. I cannot forgive her murder even if Kim Jin pays for it with his life. I will do anything to make him pay for his sins. This is... all I can say. No. If so, why would you inform the princess. You were risking the plan in order to save me! Just kill me. Only when I die, can you live. Enough. Do not forgive me. I will never forgive you. So... you need to live. Your highness, please... I told everyone to return home! The girl and Kim Min-jae ran away, your majesty. What will you do with that Kim Min-jae who ran away disobeying the royal command? Rest assured. From now on, I, your son, shall handle everything. So you are claiming innocence? This is really unfair. I frightened her a bit to get back what that bitch stole from me. I see. I will believe you, for you are my husband. I will explain to my father, the King, and ask for his forgiveness. Thank you, my love. But since sometime back... you no longer bore the smell of the scent bag. That is... And instead, I could smell it on Gahee. I didn’t mention anything as such a thing was... beyond human imagination. Only if you had told the truth just now, I might not have come this far. Ignite! Fire! Watch out! Please give me the chance to get rid of him. Please get on the boat, sir. I won’t go without you. Go first. I'll follow if I survive. How could I go alone and leave you behind? Don’t worry. I won't be long. So be sure to survive. No! My lord! Lord! My lord, please! Sir! My lord! No! My lord! Hurry, sir! Lord! Come here! Come to me! Please hide! Lord! My lord... I promised to protect you. What are you doing, my lord... No matter what happens... I made a pledge to you. My lord! No, my lord! No! No! I won't let go of this hand no matter what. - Can you promise the same? - Yes, my lord. I had a dream. What kind of dream? People were gathered and dancing together. There seemed to be no need for drawing one’s sword, No need for hurting others. Everyone just mingled together as equals, enjoying themselves. You and I were there hand in hand smiling at each other. It is a good dream. I would like to go there with you, my lord. They could not find the bodies. I see. Let the names of Kim Mn-Jae and his family be omitted from all records. And in his place, put the names of his adjutant, Lee Je, and Lord Sambong. As you command! November 1400, Prince Jung-an, Lee Bang-won ascended to the throne. He is Joseon Dynasty’s 3rd king, Taejong the Great.
