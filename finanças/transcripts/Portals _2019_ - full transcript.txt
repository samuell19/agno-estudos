My name is James Avery. I'm a physicist. I'm working on the particle acceleration program. Were you a member of the team working on the black hole project? I would love to talk about the projects we do. All our work into particle acceleration it's, um... I'm not at liberty to say. The writing was on the wall. Energy surges that didn't make any sense. There were shifts in geological data that no one could explain, and everyone thought it was glitches, software malfunctions but no one wanted to listen. The grids couldn't cope with this extra energy. It had nowhere to go. And once it dissipated, there was still residual impacts and resurges, sort of like, aftershocks, tremors. Pandemonium everywhere. You can not the authorities. You couldn't even get through. With all these energy surges, it's been difficult to keep track of everyone and locate everyone. Uh, and some people are still missing. There are rumors that maybe it's biblical. But as a scientist, um, I just don't know. Not yet. Not yet. Evacuations of most major urban areas continue across the country today, following Wednesday's blackout. Get a live look at the traffic... Where's the... uh, do, do, do. Sweety, you don't need pepper, do you? No? No pepper. OK. Hey, you gotta eat these quick, because we gotta a long road trip, OK? Eat. Gross. Mommy makes it better. Yeah, well, Mommy's busy packing. Why can't you pack, Dad? Because Mommy does it better. Come on, eat up. Though many preach caution, some express concern it could lead to widespread chaos. What's why's bad? Widespread. It means it's happening everywhere. Several homeland officials now fear there may be a connection between the blackouts and the growing list of missing people. All... Will it be happening at Nanna's? No, baby. Nanna's will be just fine. No, we don't know that. Adam, you're doing it again. Yes, of course. I'm sorry. Nanna's is going to be fine. I was just kidding, OK? Shall we? All right, you heard the boss. Her name is Mommy. What's the difference. Take those eggs to go, OK? Come on. All right. Get in. Hop along. Wha... what in the world do you think you're doing. Get in your booster. But I'm a big girl now. I know you're a big girl now, but I don't make the rules. Come on, sweetie. It's not safe. Please, we've got to go. Come on, honey. Thank you. I'm keeping my eye on you. OK. Adam, there's nothing you can do about that. Come on. Let's just get going. Ready for Nanna's? Nana banana... Road trip. Here we come. Say bye to the house, baby. Say bye bye house. Worst, he stands and pours himself a glass of liquid courage about five minutes too late. If I had to guess, I'd say Lieutenant Kane. How... how did... how did you know? Saw him pulling graveyard into a morning dove. Double shifts... You can't work... What the fuck? Daddy? Yeah, sweetie. Why did we stop? Just a little engine trouble. But we're back in business now. Don't worry about it. Go back to sleep. Daddy? Yeah, sweetie. What's up? I don't wanna go to Nanna's. Can you keep a secret? Neither do I. Are you sure we're safe? Hey. Hey. We're together, right? And we're safe. As long as I can see your face, we're safe. Hey. Hey, honey? You OK? Yeah, she's all right now, aren't you, sweetie? Adam! Look out! 9-1-1, what's your emergency? 9-1-1, what's your emergency? 9-1-1, what's your emergency? Yes. Yes, we have a blackout. Can you give me for information please? 9-1-1, what's your emergency? OK, Elizabeth, yes. What's your location, sir? Oregon. What do you mean portal. Like a... like a door? A video game. Uh, yes, ma'am. We just came up from a blackout too. I'm sure it's very frustrating to, uh, call 9-1-1 and get a busy signal. What's your location? Robert, the GPS is still down. Fuck, damn it. Um, a door. Um, uh, what kind of door? Can you describe the sound? A very loud humming. I'm sorry. The city's gone a little crazy. Please, bear with us. Robert, we need that GPS. Kathy, you got to see this. I don't have time, Stan, and neither do you. 9-1-1, what's your emergency? These images are popping up all over the place. Hello? All over the internet. Hello. Fucking bugged out in the middle of the apocalypse. Right here. See. I'm kind of busy here. 9-1-1, what's your emergency. This is what the calls are about. Hold on, sir. Take a deep breath. Just slow it down. Can I get your location. It's... it's just like what said... Is she breathing? Right here. What do you mean vanished? Remember those phantom calls? I printed out the transcripts. Yeah, they're all... we're not supposed to print transcripts without an order. If she's not there, why do you think she's dead? Right here. Kathy, they called us... they tried to contact us because they wanted us... Stop! Stop! The only reason you're still working here is because I let this crazy shit slide. But right now, you are my last fucking nerve, and you need to sit your nutty ass down and go and answer some goddamn calls. Now! 9-1-1, what's your emergency? What is your name and location? 9-1-1, what's your emergency? Homeland security stopped communications nationwide. But you can see these are communications... County General, uh, and you're a, uh, a doctor there? Remain calm. You need to keep our people safe, OK? What do you mean one of those things on the news? Keep people safe. OK, listen up everyone. Homeland Security is reporting a major incident with one of these things. Homeland Security? Emergency services are responding. What are we supposed to tell people? Just keep it simple. Tell them that the National Guard is mobilizing and to stay away from the object. OK, but what... what're... what are these things? What are they? That is not our problem. Now everybody get back to work. Ms. Kathy, um, Sarah's at home with the sitter. do I haven't been able to get in touch with her since before the blackout. She's seven years old. She must be terrified. We're all terrified. Dana and Earl have already bailed on me. If you leave, people die. Do you understand? I need you. I need you with me. We can do this together. OK? It'll be all right. 9-1-1, what's your emergency? My daughter's missing. What's your location? You got my location 20 fucking minutes ago! Sorry, ma'am. Emergency support services are overloaded at the moment. I haven't seen her since just after the blackout when we saw that thing. Ma'am, are you in a safe place. Oh, I didn't know what to do, so I went to call her father... I need you to stay away from it. She was by my side and I cannot find her. We've been warned that these things are dangerous. She's just a baby. I can't leave her. I need you to stay calm. I'm getting help. Victoria? Are you there? Ma'am, please, emergency personnel are on their way to you. - I - think I heard her. She's inside. Please, I'm sending help, ma'am. Victoria! Ma'am. What is it? I don't know. Can you hear that? It wants us to go through. Stan. Shh. OK, everybody. Leave your things. Calmly get to the stairs. What about the 9-1-1 calls. Fuck the calls. Fuck, it's not working. Here, try my card. What are your plans? Fuck! I'll get somebody up here. I'm with you 100% Stan, do you know what this is? Don't encourage him. I want this. We're not supposed to be around it. I think it's... it's nuclear or something. Well, if it was radioactive our hair would be falling out and shit. Right, Robert? Fuck do I know? Stan, quit fucking around! Why is it doing that? It's listening. Seriously, Stan, we're not supposed to be around it. Stan, how do you know about these doors. He don't know shit. The calls. Calls, what calls. Kathy knows. What fucking calls, Kathy! From a couple of years ago. We couldn't trace the number. The phone people said they didn't exist. It was a glitch in the system. They're about mysterious doors just like today. What does any of that mean? Nothing. He got these ideas right after the school shooting and right before they suspended him. You mean you, right? You wanted me fired. Stan, none of the shit in your head makes sense. None of it. It said you'd say that. Aw fuck. It wants us to go through. Stan, you don't want to do this. It doesn't matter what I want. If you think there's another way, there isn't. Larry, you're first. Me? Why me? It won't hurt, I swear. No. No fucking way, Stan. It will make me kill you. We all have to go. Nobody's touching that thing. We have to do what it says! Put the gun down. Oh my god! Oh my god, dude! What the fuck are you doing? I'll kill... I'll kill all of you. OK! OK, just stop! Just stop, see, stop. I don't wanna. Go. I don't. No. It'll be OK. It worked. Oh fuck this. We gotta get the hell out of here. No! Robert's going to die, Stan. Marie, your next. No, you saw what it did to him. You killed him. I'm not killing myself. Sarah is there. She went through. That's why she hasn't been answering your phone. You can't know that. She's scared. She needs her mommy. Tori, don't. He's playing you. It'll be OK. Tori, don't. Don't listen to him? Stay away from her. OK. OK. Get away. Do what you need to do. Just reach out and touch it. We'll be right behind you. She has what? Stay away. All of you. Why? Why'd she do that? You ruined everything. You ruined everything. Me? You can't blame me for this. Stan. This is not my fault. Stan Shut up. We need to get somebody up here. This is your fault. You gave her the scissors. Stan. Don't. We have known each other such a long time. I know you. Don't. I'm going. I'm next. Please let me in. Come on! Let me in! Oh, please. I did what you asked. Yeah, I did. You lied! You... you fucking lied. Oh, god. Police are on their way up. They're in the building. Kathy? Huh? Uh. Clear. Where are they? Hello? Hello? Can anyone hear me? Hello? Hello? Hello? Anyone? , what the fuck? Mr. Reed. Jesus. You need to stay in bed. W... where... where am I? You're at Valley Hospital. You were in a very serious accident. Is my family OK? Where's my family? Please, Mr. Reed. No, no, no. Where are they? Your family is fine. I promise. Now, if you'd just sit down and let me put the IV back in your arm, I'll tell you everything I know. Your wife left to drop your daughter off at her Nana's house. She said she would be back here to see you as soon as she could. And they weren't hurt or anything? Like I said, they're fine. What's the last thing you remember? I was driving and there was, like, a black box. It was just in the middle of the road. Just floating there. You're lucky to be alive, you know? Yeah. Wait, what do you mean? You're the first person who's hit one of them that survived. But you just said my family was OK. Right. Besides them. Well, wh... where's my phone? I have to call my wife. Just lay back and rest. And I'm going to talk to the other doctor about contacting your family. Do it right now, though. Doctor, what... what's your name? You can call me Leslie. I'll be taking care of you from now on. Please, try to hold still. I'll try. Any headaches, nausea? No. I... I just can't see anything out of this one. It's not even black. His optic nerve was severed. Can you fix it? Well, it's not something we can... Nerves don't work that way. Once they go... I'm afraid there's some bad news, as well. We are going to have to lose this eye. What? Not enough blood flow now to keep the tissue alive. Did you call my wife? Yes. Yes. She is on her way. You spoke to Andrea? And she... she's OK? Well, she's concerned, naturally. But I told her you're lucky to be alive. I'm so sorry, Adam. This must be overwhelming for you. And if you want anyone to talk to, I'm... I just want to see my family. Can you give us a moment? Hm. You know, Adam, this has got to be very difficult for you. But you have to keep in mind, you're very fortunate to have any vision at all. Easy for you to say. Hm. Yeah. Yeah. Easier than most. Well, I'm sorry. I didn't know. Nah, that's all right. You know, my own relationship to gratitude was not immediate, believe me. How did you lose yours? A growth in the wrong spot. The lights dimmed and died. And then nothing. Not even black. Right? You know, most people don't have any concept of sense blindness. After 20 years of this, I... I still can't wrap my mind around total absence of vision. An abyss you can't stare into. It sounds like a nightmare. Well, I'm not so sure. You know, the mind can adapt to new realities... if you're willing to pay the toll. No. Is this light OK for you? Wait. Wait. He's fighting it. I can see. Hey, hey, hey. You need to relax, Adam. Adam! Adam. Adam. Relax. Hold... hold his head. Hold his... Very still for me. Very still. Very still. Stop! Did you get everything you needed? Yeah. Everything is so much cheaper here. Yeah, I know. So, OK, let's plan. I think that you should take the weekend. It's two days. That's $2,000 I can't afford. What did I say about the money? Don't worry about it. Yeah, but Jill, it's also a 13-hour flight. Well, Have you asked? Sarah? No. I want to keep this job. You know what, as your sister, I really think you shouldn't. There is no future in teaching English in this foreign country. Don't be an asshole. Plus, it's really my choice, isn't it? Look, I'm just worried about you because I care. OK? I love you. And Mom's worried. Everyone back home is worried. And she really thinks you're having a nervous breakdown. I am having a nervous... What was he saying? Something about a door? Anyways, me and Mom would prefer it if you were to have this nervous breakdown somewhere where we can see you. So you can feel better about yourself? What is up with this passive aggressiveness? Look, I know you're going through a hard time, OK? We all know that. But we're here for you. I'm here for you. OK? We're trying everything that we can, Sarah. Well, then, stop, Jill. I don't need this. I mean, I can't walk when everyone tries to carry me all the freaking time. Shit takes time. OK? But you don't get that, do you? Of course you don't. You're Jill. You just have to have everything right now. I'm pregnant. OK? Of course you are. Look, you know how Mom is. I have to have this wedding now. You're going to be an aunt. I don't want to be an aunt, OK? I'm sick and tired of getting the consolation prize each and every fucking time. You know what? Fuck you, Sarah. No, don't walk away. OK, this is how you respond to me every single time. This is how you tell me? How the fuck... how the fuck am I supposed to tell you anything if you just walk the fuck away? It's not fair. You're starting a family. I just lost mine. I know that. I lost my baby. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Sarah. I'm... I'm sorry, Sarah. No! What the fuck's happening? What's going on? Jill? what's going on? Jill? Can you hear that? Can you hear that, Sarah? Jill. - Jill. - No! Jill. Jill. Jill. Jill, listen, I'm sorry if I made you mad, but... It's not me. Jill. Jill? Jill? Shit. What's happening, Jill? Jill? Jill? Look, I said I was sorry, Jill. Jill, listen, I said I was sorry. But where are you? It's all right. Sarah. Jill? Follow me. You're freaking me out. Just... Jill. Jill. Jill. Jill. Jill? Can you hear it, Sarah? It's calling us. It's everything that you want. Where did he go? Hey! Jill! What are you doing? Jill, stop. Jill, no. Oh! Fuck you! Oh, shit. I'm sorry. Oh! Fuck. Are you OK? I'm bleeding. Fuck! OK, but we've got to go now, OK? We've got to go. What the fuck is happening? No! Going... going down and we're going to get the fucking car. What the fuck, Sarah? Sh. Jill! Jill. Jill, let's go. Don't look! OK. You need to fuck... We've got to find the car. Sh. Sh. Sh. Sh. Jill. Jill. Jill. Jill. Jill, Jill. I need you with me. OK? Jill. We've got to find the car. OK? Jill, Jill, Jill, Jill, we have to. I can't. We have to go. I can't. I can't. Jill, please. OK? Sarah. Sarah. The door wants you. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. The door wants you. No, no, no, no, no. Jill. And it's going to give me something. Fuck, Sarah. I'm doing this so we can go home, OK? You're going to stay here. No, don't leave me, Sarah. Please don't leave me. - Please. - Jill. Jill. I'll be back. OK? Jill? Jill? I'll be back. I'll be back. OK? Sarah, come back. Jill. Jill, Jill,. Sarah. Get me out of here. Here, we're going to go home. OK? OK. Sarah. Sarah. Kill him. Kill him. Kill him. We lost them. I think we're good. OK. Just drive. We need to go up the stairs. The exit's on the right hand, Sarah. ...now coming in, this blackout is worldwide. The right, Sarah. On the right. OK, OK! I'm going. Repeat, do not go outside. OK, Jill! What's wrong? Just drive. Turn left, Sarah. What? Turn left. No, the exit is straight ahead. Turn left. No! Turn left, Sarah. - No, Jill. - Turn left! Jill, no. The exit is straight ahead. Jill! No. Jill! We're ready, Sarah. Jill! Jill! No! Jill? Is this even real? Does it even matter? Are you... is Jill OK? Sh. Sh. How are you feeling, Adam? You sleeping all right? Any more lucid dreams or nightmares? It felt real to me, OK? I could see out of both eyes. And then... Adam, we've been over this. The operation was a complete success. No complications, and so far, no setbacks. OK? How are you adjusting sight-wise? I'm still getting used to it. Dr. Markonen told me to pass on that your wife called again. She apologized for the delay and said she'll be here soon. They're lying to you, of course. You know, it's OK to feel anxious. About seeing your wife. They think you're weak. You've just had major surgery. It's a big adjustment for everyone. With a loss of health, it's not uncommon to feel a betrayal. Too weak to know the truth. That your own body is turning against you. It's not unusual to feel... well, that you're not really whole. That there's something missing. Oh, there's something missing... doctor. That's for sure... my daughter. My wife. My sight. But I know you're ready to see. How long is this going to go on? Did Markonen feed you that bit about betrayal? It seems like something you'd have to experience in order to articulate. Through me. Why can't I see my family? Let go of the door, Adam. Why can't I see them? Let go now! What the fuck? What? Can you see me, Adam? Adam. Uh, your bandages. Um, y... yeah. I... I had... had an itch. Well, you should have waited for me. Well, my patience is wearing a little thin, doc. But we... we don't want it to get infected. Is that why it looks like this? No. Uh, this is the latest prosthetic. And, uh, I know it takes a little getting used to, but I promise it's... it's helping the surrounding tissues heal fas... It doesn't feel like a prosthetic. Will you please let me look at it? You don't want to wait for Dr. Leslie? No. Um, I sent her home. She hasn't been feeling well lately. Welcome to the club. OK. Here we go. OK. Now the hard part. - I - know what you want. Easy. D... did you hear that? What? I'll take you to your wife and daughter. I know this is very uncomfortable for you, Adam. But it's also very important. Can you please try to relax? An eye for an eye, Adam. Very still. Still, now. Easy. Very still, now. You know what you have to do. Easy. Easy. How much longer? Uh, just, uh... just... just a moment, please. It burns. Do it. Yeah, yeah. Just take a breath. Take a breath. Wow. Do it! I need a break! No. Wait! I can't. Yes, you can, Adam. Yes, you can. Oh, you are lucky to be alive. Pay the toll! Whoa. Whoa. Adam. Adam. Calm down. Calm down. You did this to me, didn't you? No. No. I'm sorry. I had to see it. Who the fuck are you? Adam, if you just give me a... Mother fucker! You know, you've been given a gift. Insights into realities we can't even conceive of. And what do you do, huh? What do you do? You succumb to blind rage? No. No. Sorry, Adam. You don't deserve it. No! No! No! No! - Don't shoot. - No, no, no. I had to stop him. Don't shoot. He was going to kill you. What do you want from me? Adam, please. I just want to help. Your wife... she hasn't called. She's on the other side. Almost everyone is. My family, too. Other side of what? The thing you crashed into. We think it's some kind of doorway or portal. Portal to where? Where are they? We were hoping you could tell us. Me? You passed through, Adam. And somehow, you made it back... with that. This? But he said that this is a prosthesis. He tried cutting it out and it started changing, and I stopped him. He became obsessed, insisting it was some link to the other side, like a window or... Or a mirror. Tell me everything you know. Follow me. Some are convinced they're extraterrestrial, even interdimensional beings. Others tend to get more biblical. What do you think? There's an intelligence behind them. That's all we know for sure. And they're not to be underestimated. What is this place? We're a VA hospital with some additional services. You mean like a military base? Used to be, anyway. Ah! Keep your eye closed. It's only going to get worse from here. Lost a lot of lives bringing it here. Markonen insisted. We discovered that it emits a form of high-frequency radiation. So we tried communicating with it. What did it say? I think it says something different for each of us. For Markonen, it promised answers, insight. And then you showed up with that eye. What did it promise you? My wife. In exchange for what? For me? Maybe you can save both our families. You're the only one who's been to the other side and back. Well, it wasn't free, was it? That's a risk I'm willing to take. Are you? Good luck. How long does this take? Oh! Oh, no. No, no. No, no, no, no, no, no! Gah! Son of a bitch! Fuck! Fuck it. Gah! Ow! What the fuck? Ah! Daddy! Honey? Honey! Andrea? That was my mother's name. Who are you? Kate? How do you know my name? No. It's... it's your dad. Kate, no! Please, no. Kate, I have to ask you... Have a seat, Adam. Is this some kind of a joke? It's funny to you, too. Sit down. What did you do to my daughter? Nothing. But neither did you. And look at her... happy, healthy, well-adjusted. Almost as if she's better off without you. Why are you doing this to me? We're well beyond that, Adam. Let's think of this as an experiment... or an exchange. We see the world through your eyes, while you live happily on our side. Andrea. Kate. Or you could leave us and let fate take its course. It's your choice... if you're willing to pay for it. These roads have a toll, I'm afraid. What do you want from me? Stay, and give us the other eye. Leave, and we take back your new eye. One or the other. You can't have both. If I stay, I won't really see them again, will I? It w... it won't be real. It never really was. You just didn't notice. But you would be together. Happy. Isn't that what really matters? Adam, close your eyes. And open them. Welcome home, Adam. Your family is waiting for you. See their faces. Make them safe again. Be together forever. All that's left now is to pay the toll. An eye for an eye. You want me to pay the toll? Take them. What's he doing? No. No. We had a deal. The mind can adapt to new realities. If you're willing to pay the toll. Honestly, considering the accident, it's a miracle, really. He's lucky to be alive. No, doctor, thank you for everything. We're so grateful. We removed the bandages today. Dr. Markonen felt it best the wounds be left to breathe and heal on their own. Are you sure she's going to be OK with this? I just want to see Daddy's face. Yeah. Adam. Someone's here to see you. Honey? Oh, sweetie. Oh, sweetie. Oh! Where do I think they're from? Hard to say, at the moment. They don't have any masks, it seems. But they are there. And people have interacted with them. That changes everything we know about physics. So many people have lost their loved ones. Everyone's been affected. But you... you hope. We have no idea what they are. And I think it's going to take a while before we have any solid understanding. But we m... we just don't know. And that's a little terrifying. I've gone over the calculations again and again. And I still can't guaran... James, we both have. If the connection between the two portals isn't stable while we're inside, we're, for lack of a better term, completely fucked. Look, we've done the work. We've tracked the patterns. Our science is sound. Now all we need is a bit of faith, OK? Have a little faith. Anna, you do know this is a portal we're talking about? James, look around us. There is nothing left. We need to do this now. OK. Initiating energy burst. Anna? I'm OK. It worked. It worked! You did it. I can't believe you're here. Like, it's actually you. Oh, god. You... you know what this means. Phase 2. Come on. Both of us now. No. F... absolutely not. We haven't... we need to check that you're all right first. No. We're not going to do that again. - I'm not... - I'm totally fine. Come on. Anna... The connection works. We need to try it now, while we can. Do I need to make another speech? Maybe. The first one seemed to work all right. OK, come on. This is the only way we can be sure if we can save the others. OK, OK. OK. But we're doing it my way. Give me some time to make some calculations. Frequency's strong. Connection is stable. Um. The door is open. OK. I'll be right behind you, OK? Yes. Come on, Anna. Come on. Come on. Fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck. Anna, come on. Come on, come on. Anna? Anna. I've seen what is coming, James. The portals are just the beginning. What's coming is the end.
