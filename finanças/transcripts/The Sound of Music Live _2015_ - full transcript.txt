Out of 28 postulants, 16 or 17 are ready to enter the novitiate. Well, let's consider the doubtful ones again. There's Irmgard. -Reverend Mother, there is no doubt about Irmgard. The religious life is no place for the pious. -You mean the pretentiously pious, Sister Berthe. Christina? -No. -Hmm. Then there's...Maria. -Well, after last night, there can be no doubt in the Reverend Mother's mind about Maria! -I gave Maria permission to leave the abbey for the day. -I told you, Sister Berthe. -Reverend Mother? Maria's waiting. -Ah, Sister Sophia. The mistress of the postulants and the mistress of the novices do not seem to see eye to eye about Maria.

Sit down, Maria. I want to talk to you. -Yes, about last night. Reverend Mother, I was on my knees most of the night because I was late, and after you'd been so kind and given me permission to leave. -It wasn't about your being late, Maria. -I must've awakened half the abbey before Sister Margaretta heard me and opened the gate. -Maria. Very few of us were asleep. We could only think that you'd lost your way. And to be lost at night on that mountain... -Reverend Mother, I couldn't be lost on that mountain. That's my mountain. I was brought up on it. It was that mountain that brought me to you. -Oh? -When I was a little girl, I used to come down the mountain, climb a tree, and look over into your garden. I'd see the sisters at work, and I'd hear them sing on their way to vespers. Many times I went back up that mountain in the dark, singing all the way. And that brings up another transgression. I have been singing without your permission. -Maria, it is only here in the abbey that there is a rule about singing. -Hmm. That's the hardest rule of all for me. -The day you were in the garden, singing at the top of your voice... -Mother, it's that kind of song. -...I came to the window, and you stopped. I wish you hadn't. I used to sing that song when I was a child. Only...I can't quite remember.

What is the most important lesson you've learned here? -To find out what is the will of God and to do it. -Even if it's hard to accept? -Even then. -Maria, it seems it's the will of God that you leave us. -Leave? Leave here? -For a while only. -Oh, no, don't send me away, Mother, please! This is what I want! This is my life! - But are you ready for it? Perhaps if you go out into the world again for a time, you will return to us knowing what we expect of you and that we do expect it. -I know what you expect, Mother, and I'll do it! I promise! -Maria! -If it is God's will. Where am I to go? -There's a family. A family of seven children. You like children, and you're very good with them. They need a governess until September. -Until September? -Captain Von Trapp is expecting you tomorrow. He's a fine man and a brave one. He was given the Maria Theresa medal by the Emperor. It was for heroism in the Adriatic. -Captain in the Navy. Mother, he'll be very strict. -Maria, you are not being sent to his battleship.

Do you know why? -Sometimes she doesn't hear, sir. Ah. -Ah. Sorry, sir. I was answering the telephone. Good day, sir. We're happy to have you home again. -Why did the last governess leave? -Who knows? She just said, "I've had enough of this," and walked out. -Why? Was Louisa playing tricks again, putting toads in her bed? -She didn't complain of that, sir. -Well, there's another one coming today, and this one can't walk out. -Oh? -She's coming from Nonnberg Abbey with orders to stay until September. -Well, I hope you'll be at home for a time, sir. -Just until tomorrow. The telephone call. Was it for me? -Uh, no, it was for Franz. But before you arrived, there was a call from Vienna -- a Frau Schrader. I have her number in the pantry. -I know the number. Oh, I shall be back in about a month with some guests. -Yes, sir. Do you know how many, sir? -Just two. Herr Detweiler... -Ah, Herr Detweiler. -...and Frau Schrader. -Who wanted me on the telephone? -It was the post office. -What? -There's a telegram for you. It'll be delivered at 7:00. -7:00? That gives me five hours to be nervous. -Well, with that scatterbrained boy delivering telegrams... -That's one thing people are saying. If the Germans did take over Austria, we'd have efficiency. -Don't let the Captain hear you say that. Ugh! He never whistled for us when his wife was alive. -He's being the captain of the ship again. -Oh. I can't bear being whistled for. It's humiliating. -In the Imperial Navy, the bosun always whistled for us. -I wasn't in the Imperial Navy. -Too bad. You could've made a fortune. Oh, it's you. Wait here. -I am Captain Von Trapp. You are Fraulein...? -Maria. Maria Rainer. -Now, Fraulein, as to your duties here... Would you mind stepping over there? Before the children meet you, you will put on another dress. -I haven't any other dress. When we enter the abbey, all our worldly clothes are given to the poor. -What about this one? -The poor didn't want this one. I would've made myself a dress, but I wasn't given time. I can make my own clothes. -Good. Now, you will be in charge of my children. There are seven of them. You will find out how far they have progressed in their studies and carry on from there. Each morning will be spent in the classroom, each afternoon they march. You will see that at all times they conduct themselves with decorum and orderliness. The first rule in this house is discipline. -Yes, sir! -This is your new governess, Fraulein Maria. As I sound your signal, you will step forward and repeat your name. You, Fraulein, will listen and learn their signal so that you can call them when you want them. - Liesl! - Friedrich! - Louisa! - Kurt! - Brigitta! - Marta. -That's Gretl. Now, Fraulein, let's see how well you listened. -Oh! I won't have to whistle for them, Reverend Captain. What I mean is I'll be with them all the time. -Not on all occasions. This is a large house and a large estate. They have been taught to come only when they hear their signal. Now, when I want you, this is what you'll hear. -Pardon me, sir, you won't have to bother with a whistle, because I couldn't answer to it. -That's nonsense. Everyone in this house answers to a whistle. I'll show you. -Yes, sir? -This is my orderly, my butler. The new governess, Fraulein Maria. -Yes, sir? -That is the executive officer, Frau Schmidt, the housekeeper. Fraulein Maria. Please be sure that her room is ready. -Yes, sir. -Well, I shall now leave you with the children. You are in command. -Pardon me, sir. I don't know how to address you. -You will call me Captain. -Thank you, Captain. Here's your whistle, Captain. I won't be needing it. Captain. Well, now that there's just us, would you tell me your names again and tell me how old you are? Now you're...? -I'm Liesl. I'm 16, and I don't need a governess. -I'm glad you told me. We'll just be friends. -I'm Friedrich. I'm 14. I'm a boy. -Boy? Why, you're almost a man. -I'm Brigitta. -You didn't tell me how old you are...Louisa. -I'm Brigitta. She's Louisa, and she's 13 years old. And you're smart. I'm 9, and I think your dress is the ugliest one I've ever saw. -Brigitta, you mustn't say a thing like that! -Why not? Don't you think it's ugly? -Well, if I did think so, I wouldn't say so. I'm Kurt. I'm 11. Well, almost. -I'm Marta. I'm going to be 7 on Tuesday, and I would like a pink parasol for my birthday. -Pink's my favorite color, too. And you're Gretl. I'm going to tell you something. I've never been a governess before. How do I start? -You mean you don't know anything about being a governess? -No. -Well, the first thing you have to do is to tell Father to mind his own business. -No, Louisa, don't! I like her. -What's in here? -My guitar. -What did you bring this for? -For when we all sing together. -But we don't sing. -Well, of course you sing. Everybody sings. What songs do you know? -Well, we don't know any songs. -You don't? -No. -Well, now I know where to start.

I mean, how did you know two days ago that you would be here at just this time tonight with a telegram for Franz? -Every year on this day he always gets a birthday telegram from his sister. -You see? You are wonderful. -Can I come again tomorrow night? -Rolf, you can't be sure you're going to have a telegram to deliver tomorrow night. -I could come here by mistake -- with a telegram for Colonel Schneider. He's here from Berlin. He's staying with the Gauleiter, but I... No one's supposed to know he's here. -Don't you tell your father. -Why not? -Well, your father's pretty Austrian. -We're all Austrian. -Some people think we ought to be German. They're mad at those who don't think so. They're getting ready to... Well, let's hope your father doesn't get into any trouble. -Oh, don't worry about Father. He was decorated for bravery. -I know. It's not him that I worry about. The only one I care about is his daughter. -Why? -How old are you, Liesl? - Sixteen. -What?

Hmm. The Captain's going to Vienna tomorrow. I have this material he ordered for a new dress for you. -Oh, how nice of him. Even before it's made, this is the prettiest dress I've ever had. I hope the Captain will like it, because I want to ask him for more material. -More? -Not for me, for the children, for play clothes. The Von Trapp children aren't supposed to play. The Captain doesn't like them to get dirty. -But they're children. They have to climb trees, roll on the grass. -The Captain believes the best exercise is marching. The children will continue to march. Well, hope you find your room comfortable. -Yes, thank you. There'll be new curtains at the window and the alcove, and they'll be hung tomorrow. -But these curtains are very good. -There will be new curtains. -Will the Captain be away long? -Oh, I don't know. Of course, he has to come home every time he hires a new governess. I sometimes think those children get rid of their governesses just because they want to see their father. -He must want to see them, too. -Well, since his wife died, they remind him too much of her. Oh, you can put that away. You won't be using that. -Why not? -Well, the Captain won't have music here. -He won't have music? -He used to love music. There were wonderful evenings here. His wife would sing, and he'd play the violin or the guitar. But he's shut all that out of his life now. -So that's why he's the way he is. But not to have music, that's wrong for him and wrong for the children, too. -It'll work out. The Captain may well marry again before the summer's over. -That would change everything. They'd have a mother again. -It's going to rain. You'd better close your window. -Dear God. I know now that you have sent me here on a mission. I must help these children to love their new mother and prepare them to win her love so that she will never want them to leave her. And I pray that this will become a happy family in thy sight. God bless the Captain, God bless Liesl and Friedrich, Louisa, Brigitta, Marta, and little Gretl. And, oh, yes, I forgot the other boy. What's his name? Well, God bless What's His Name. God bless the Reverend Mother and Sister Margaretta and everybody at Nonnberg Abbey. And now, dear God, what about Liesl? Help her to know that I am her friend. Help her to tell me what she's up to. -Are you going to tell on me? -Help me to be understanding so that I may guide her footsteps. In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, amen. -I-I was out taking a walk, and somebody locked the doors earlier than usual. I didn't want to wake anyone up, so when I saw your window was open... Oh, you're not going to tell Father, are you? -Did you climb that trellis to get up here?! -It's how we always used to get into this room to play tricks on the governess. -Liesl... were you out walking all by yourself? You know, if we wash that dress out tonight, nobody would notice it tomorrow, and all this will just be between you and me. You could put this on. Take your dress in there, put it to soak in the bathtub. Then come back here, sit on the edge of my bed, and we'll have a talk. -I told you today I didn't need a governess. Well...maybe I do. --Oh! It's you, Gretl! Are you afraid? Oh. Oh, you're not afraid of a thunderstorm, are you? You just stay right here with me. Where are the others? -They're asleep. They're not scared. -Come, all of you, up on the bed. Now all we have to do is wait for the boys. -We won't see them. -Boys are brave. - Aah! -You boys aren't scared, too, are you? -Oh, no. We just wanted to be sure you weren't. -Was this your idea, Friedrich? -No, it was Kurt's. -That's it -- Kurt! That's who I left out. God bless Kurt!

When the wind moves through it, it's like a restless sea. I'm beginning to understand you better, now that I see you here. You know, you are a little like those mountains. Well, except that you keep moving. How can you be away from this place as much as you are? -Maybe I've been searching for a reason to come back here to stay. -Georg, I like it here very much. -Max can't still be on the telephone. I know he's desperate about getting singers for the Kaltzberg Festival, but... You like it here? -Of course, we'd have to spend some time in Vienna. I have Heinrich's estate to look after. -I thought that was a corporation now. -It is, and I'm president. -Well, I can't see you sitting behind a desk. -Oh? Oh, well, of course, I wear a business suit, and I smoke a very big cigar. -Sorry I took so long. -Ah, any luck? -Ooh, how do you like this for the Kaltzberg Festival -- the finest choral group in Austria, the greatest mixed quartet in Europe, and the best soprano in the world. -That's something I'd love to hear. -Ah, me too. All I've got up to now is a basso who isn't even profundo. - Max, you always come up with a good festival concert. -And why? Because my motto is never start out looking for the people you wind up getting. That is why I have been telephoning Rome, Paris, Stockholm, London... -On Georg's telephone, of course. -How else could I afford it? Why am I up here? -I hoped it was because you liked me. -Of course I like you. Why shouldn't I like you? You live like a king. You have an excellent wine cellar. -Max! -I like rich people! I like the way they live. I like the way that I live when I'm among them. Speaking as a government official, Georg, I... Is there a cathedral near here? -That's our abbey. Nonnberg Abbey. -They have a choir? -A beautiful one. -Good! In the next few days, I have to visit all these towns around here, listen to saengerbunds, quartets, choirs -- -You'll be here for meals, won't you? -Yes. Now, tell me, who lives in that dilapidated castle down there? Rumpelstiltskin? - Baron Elberfeld, the oldest family in the valley. -Ah, I'd like to meet him. Well, I'd like to meet all your friends. Georg, why don't you throw a dinner for me while I'm here? Nothing very much. Just something terribly lavish. -Well, I -- I wouldn't know who to invite. Today, it's difficult to tell who's a friend and who's an enemy. -Now isn't a good time to make enemies. So let's make some friends! -I can't understand what's happened to the children. -You're not worried about them, are you? -They should've been here to welcome you. -Oh. Well, it couldn't have been an intentional slight. They haven't even met me yet. -Forgive me. I'll try to find them. -So, Elsa, have you made Georg's mind up yet? Is he gonna marry you? -Oh, yes. He just hasn't admitted it yet. No, there seems to be something standing in his way. -You don't know what it is? -No. -I do. -What? -It's very simple. It's money. -Money? -Yes, you see, he is very, very rich, and so are you. -Max, it's... -♪ In all the famous love affairs ♪ ♪ The lovers have to struggle ♪ In garret rooms away upstairs ♪ ♪ The lovers starve and snuggle ♪ ♪ They're famous for misfortune ♪ ♪ Which they seem to have no fear of ♪ ♪ While lovers who are very rich ♪ ♪ You very seldom hear of -Not a sign of them anywhere. -♪ No little shack do you share with me ♪ ♪ We do not flee from a mortgagee ♪ ♪ Nary a care in the world have we ♪ -♪ How can love survive? -♪ You're fond of bonds, and you own a lot ♪ ♪ I have a plane and a diesel yacht ♪ -♪ Plenty of nothing you haven't got ♪ -♪ How can love survive? -♪ No rides for us on the top of a bus ♪ ♪ In the face of the freezing breezes ♪ -♪ You'll reach your goals in your comfy old Rolls ♪ ♪ Or in one of your Mercedeses -♪ Far, very far off the beam are we ♪ ♪ Quaint and bizarre as a team are we ♪ ♪ Two millionaires with a dream are we ♪ ♪ But we'll keep romance alive ♪ Two millionaires with a dream are we ♪ ♪ We'll make our love ♪ Survive ♪ No little cold-water flat have we ♪ ♪ Warmed by the glow of insolvency ♪ -♪ Up to your necks in security ♪ ♪ How can love survive? -♪ How can I show what I feel for you? ♪ ♪ I cannot go out and steal for you ♪ ♪ I cannot die like Camile for you ♪ ♪ How can love survive? -♪ You millionaires with financial affairs ♪ ♪ Are too busy for simple pleasures ♪ ♪ When you are poor, it is toujours l'amour ♪ For l'amour all the poor have leisure ♪ -♪ Caught in our gold-plated chains are we ♪ ♪ Lost in our wealthy domains are we ♪ ♪ Trapped by our capital gains are we ♪ -♪ You'll keep romance alive ♪ Trapped by your capital gains are you ♪ -♪ You'll make your love -♪ We'll make our love -♪ Survive -What do you want? -Oh, Captain.

Now get out. -Oh, Georg, he's just a boy. -I'm an Austrian. I will not be heiled. -Oh, Georg, why don't you look at things the way I do? What's gonna happen is gonna happen. Just be sure it doesn't happen to you. -Max, it's a good thing you haven't any character, because if you had, I'm convinced I'd hate you. - You couldn't hate me. I'm too loveable. -Herr Detweiler, there's a call for you. -It's from -- -I'll take it. -Well, hurry up! Ohh! Oh, Captain, you're home! - Straight line! Get cleaned up and report back here. At once. Fraulein, where did they get these abominations? Out of a nightmare? -No, out of some curtains, the curtains that used to hang in my bedroom. There was plenty of wear left in them. -Just -- Just -- Just a moment. Do you mean to say the people of the neighborhood have seen my children wearing old curtains? -Yes, they've become very popular. -Everyone smiles at them. -I don't wonder. -They say, "There go Captain Von Trapp's children." -My children have always been a credit to my name. -Oh, but, Captain, they weren't. They were just unhappy little marching machines. -I don't care to hear from you about my children! -You must hear from someone! You're not home long enough to know them! -I said I don't want to hear! -I know you don't, but you've got to! Take Liesl. Liesl isn't a child anymore. And if you keep treating her as one, Captain, you're going to have a mutiny on your hands. And Friedrich -- Friedrich's afraid to be himself. He's just shy. He's aloof. He needs you. He needs your confidence. -Don't tell me about my son. -Brigitta could tell you about him. She could tell you a lot more if you got to know her, because she notices things, and she always tells the truth, especially when you don't want to hear it. Kurt is sensitive, he's easily hurt, and you ignore him. You brush him aside the way you do all of them. I haven't finished yet! Louisa wants to have a good time. You've just got to let her have a good time. Marta I don't know about yet, but somebody has to find out about her. And little Gretl just wants to be loved. Oh, please, Captain, love Gretl. Love all of them. They need you! -Stop. Stop it. You will pack your things and return to the abbey as soon as you can. -I'm sorry. -♪ The hills are alive with the sound of music ♪ -I shouldn't have said those things in the way I said them. -After you've gone, they'll -- What is that? -Singing. -Whose singing? -♪ With songs they have sung for a thousand years ♪ -The children. -My children singing? -I wanted them to sing for Frau Schrader when they met her. -♪ The hills fill my heart ♪ With the sound of music -♪ Ah-ah-ah-ah -♪ My heart wants to sing every song it hears ♪ -♪ Every song it hears -♪ My heart wants to beat ♪ Like the wings of the birds that rise ♪ ♪ From the lake to the trees -♪ From the lake to the trees -♪ My heart wants to sigh like a chime that flies ♪ -♪ From a church on a breeze -♪ I go to the hills -♪ Ah-ah-ah-ah -♪ When my heart is lonely -♪ Ah-ah-ah-ah -♪ I know I will hear -♪ Ah-ah-ah-ah -♪ What I've heard before ♪ My heart will be blessed ♪ With the sound of music -♪ Ahh-ahh -♪ And I'll sing -♪ Once more - Edelweiss. Ohh! Georg, why didn't you tell me how enchanting your children are? -Children, I'd like to have you show Frau Schrader the gardens. -Oh, yes! Yes, show me the gardens. I want to see everything. And with all of you, too. Now, I don't know any of your names yet, but, well, that doesn't matter, does it? I'm sure I won't get them right for a very long time. -My name is Marta. -It is not! -My name's Marta. She's Louisa. -You were right. I don't know my own children. -They're waiting to know you. They want so much to. After I've gone -- -No. I want you to stay. -If I can be of any help. -You have helped already. You have brought music back into my home.

I came back to congratulate you. The Captain was really moved. -He's asked me to stay on with the children. -Yes, so you're staying on? -Then I go back to the abbey. -The abbey? -I'm going to be a nun. -How nice. Well, um, when you get back to the abbey, you'll -- you'll think of us. -I'll pray for you. -That's right. Now, you must do that for all the guests. Come along, children. The party's started. -Frau Schmidt, will you make my bow? We've never had a party in our house before. -Ooh, yes, there used to be lots of parties here. -Friedrich and I used to sneak out and watch them from the top of the stairs. -I remember the music. -Now, go ahead, children, and mind your manners. -Come along. -I remember the beautiful ladies, and everybody loved them. -There was one lady, the most beautiful of all. I think she was here all the time. -Yes, Louisa. Go. -But be careful what you say, Baron. You have German blood, haven't you? -I am not a German. I am Austrian. -There's going to be Anschluss! I warn you. And everyone like you. And that goes for -- -It's, uh, much more pleasant on the terrace. -Elberfeld, it's very nice to have you and the Baroness here again. -Frau Schrader is charming, Georg. -She's just coming down. -We'll find you on the terrace. Please. -Father? I don't think these people are having a very good time. -Half the people I invited aren't speaking to the other half. -Well, maybe they're having a good time not speaking to each other. -Kurt, I haven't danced the Laendler since I was a little girl. -Oh, you remember it. -No, I haven't danced since -- -Come. You said the left hand behind the back. -Yes, that's right, but first, the boy and girl meet. -Yes. -They go for a little stroll. --No, that's wrong, Kurt. Let me show you. -I don't remember any more. -Well, th-- that's the way it's done, Kurt. -Your face is all red. -Guess I'm not very used to dancing. -Hello. -Good evening, Frau Schrader. -Hello, Uncle Max. -Ohh! -We're having a party. -Good! Tell your father it's sure to be a success. I'm here. Elsa, you are without a doubt the most beautiful corporation president in the entire world. -Max, you're back and, as usual, just in time for dinner. -Georg, did you think you could give a gala without me? -Oh, dear, now we have an odd man. -A little odd but charming. -Oh, Liesl, run and ask Frau Schmidt to set two more places. I want to seat Fraulein Maria. -Two places? -We need another woman. -Oh. Liesl. -Oh, no, she's much too young. I'll ask Maria. -You can't be serious. -But of course. -But she's a nursemaid. -I don't think of her that way. -I mean, I don't mind, but your friends -- you can't ask them to dine with Maria. -Why not? -Oh, Elsa, tell him why not. -Max, can you change in a hurry? -Yes, Max. We can use you tonight. -It's very important that you children like Frau Schrader. -I like her, all right. Why is it important? Well, I think she's going to be your new mother. -Oh, Fraulein, Father's never going to marry her. Why, he -- he couldn't. -Why not? -Because he's in love with you. -Now, Brigitta, that's just -- -You must know that. -Brigitta, no. -Remember the other night when we were all sitting on the floor, singing the "Edelweiss" song you taught us? After we finished, you laughed at him for forgetting the words. But he didn't forget the words. He just stopped singing to look at you. And when he speaks to you, the way his voice sounds, and the way you looked at him just now when you were dancing, you're in love with him. -One more dance, Gretl, and then bed, hm? Ah, Fraulein Maria, you're not going to have dinner with the children tonight. You're going to have dinner down here with us. It's all arranged. You'll have to hurry. You'll have to change. -Uh, Georg, I've asked the children to say good night the way they did last night. -No, Elsa, not here. -Oh, no, please, Georg. The way they did it for me, it was so sweet. -No, no, not in front of strangers. -Please, Georg. For me? Please. This way. -Presto chango! -Max, you're just in time.

Fraulein Maria taught them to do it. -I've been looking all over Austria for something just like this for the festival, and I-I find it right here. -Ah, now, wait a minute, Max. -A singing group of seven children all in one family. -Max, Georg didn't even want them to sing in front of the guests tonight. I had to persuade him. -Ah, then you have influence. You must speak to him. -Max. -It's for the good of Austria! And it wouldn't do me any harm. -Maria has asked to see you. I know it has taken her a long time. -I waited till she wanted to come to me. -It's strange. She's happy to be here, but she's unhappy, too. -Why did they send her back? Do you know? -She doesn't speak. She hasn't spoken except in prayer. -I shall see her. -Maria. -This must have been a trying experience for you. -It was, Reverend Mother. -Has it taught you anything? -I've learned I never want to leave these walls again. -Why did they send you back to us? -They didn't send me back. I left. I left without telling them I was going, without saying goodbye. -Sit down, Maria. Maria, what happened? Why did you do this? -I was frightened. -Frightened? -I was confused. I felt -- I never felt that way before. I couldn't stay. And I knew that here I would be away from it, that here I would be safe. -Maria, our abbey is not to be used as an escape. What is it you can't face? -I can't face him again. -Maria, are you in love with Captain Von Trapp? -I don't know. I don't know. -Tell me about it, child. -Brigitta said that I was and that her father was in love with me. And then there he was, and we were looking at each other. I could hardly breathe! And I knew I couldn't stay. -But do you like him? -Oh, yes. -And did you let him see how you felt? -If I did, I didn't know that I did. That's what's been torturing me. I was there on God's errand. To have asked for the Captain's love would've been wrong. I don't know, Mother. I do know this. I'm ready at this very moment to take the vows of poverty, obedience, and chastity. -Maria... the love of a man and a woman is holy, too. You were born of happiness, of love. And, my child... you have a great capacity to love. What you must find out is, how does God want you to spend your life? -I've pledged my life to God's service! I've pledged my life to God! -My daughter, if you love this man, it doesn't mean you love God less. You must find out. You must go back. -Oh, no, Mother, please don't ask me to do that. Please let me stay here. -Maria, these walls were not made to shut out problems. You have to face them. You have to find the life you were born to live. -How do I find it? -You look for it. ♪ Climb ev'ry mountain ♪ Search high and low ♪ Follow ev'ry byway ♪ Every path you know ♪ Climb ev'ry mountain ♪ Ford ev'ry stream ♪ Follow ev'ry rainbow ♪ Till you find your dream ♪ A dream that will need ♪ All the love you can give ♪ Every day of your life ♪ For as long as you live ♪ Climb ev'ry mountain ♪ Ford ev'ry stream ♪ Follow ev'ry rainbow ♪ Till you find your dream ♪ A dream that will need ♪ All the love you can give ♪ Every day of your life ♪ For as long as you live ♪ Climb ev'ry mountain ♪ Ford ev'ry stream ♪ Follow ev'ry byway ♪ Till you find your ♪ Dr-e-e-e-e-e-eam -♪ One little girl in a pale pink coat heard ♪ -♪ Lay-ee, odl-lay-ee, odl-lay-hee-hoo ♪ -♪ She yodeled back to the lonely goatherd ♪ -♪ Lay-ee, odl-lay-ee, odl-oo -♪ Soon her mama with a gleaming gloat heard ♪ -♪ What a duet for a girl and goatherd ♪ -♪ Lay-ee, odl-lay-ee, odl-oo ♪ O-ho, lay-dee, odl-lee-o -♪ Oh-ho... -Oh.

I'll be glad to go to boarding school. -Liesl, you can't use boarding school to escape your problems. You have to face them! Oh, I have so much to talk to you about. -We have some things to tell you, too. -I'm sure you have a great deal to tell me. -Well, I guess the most important thing is that Father's going to be married. -Married? -To Frau Schrader. -Are you sure? -He just told us himself. -Louisa, Brigitta, boys. Maria, we'll be in the nursery. -You've come back. -Yes, Captain. -You left us without any explanation whatsoever, without even saying goodbye. -And it was very wrong of me. Forgive me. -Well, why did you do this to us? Tell me. -Please don't ask me. Anyway, the reason no longer exists. -Well, then you're back to staying? -Only until you can make arrangements for another governess. -Oh, no, you'd be missed by the children. I'd miss -- Everybody's missed you very much. Nothing was the same while you were away. Everything was...wrong. -But I -- -We'll talk about it later. You go up to the children now. Maria. A new dress? -I know I'm right, Max. -I'll take your word for it, Elsa. Ah. -Ah. Georg. Now, you'll settle this for Max and me, will you? How far down the mountain does your property go? -Oh, uh, can you make out that stone wall? That's the property line. -Ah. You see? -I didn't argue about it. -Oh, I know, and that makes me furious. I don't like to win without a fight. -Herr Detweiler, while you were gone, you had a long-distance call from Berlin. -Who could be calling from Berlin? -They said you'd know who it was. -Ah. Uh, thank you, Franz. Oh, Georg, you know I have no political convictions. Can I help it if other people do? -Yes, let's not stir that up again. The Germans have promised not to invade Austria, and Max knows that. -Then why does he bother to take those calls from Berlin? -Because if they don't keep their promise, I want to have some friends among them. -Naturally. -Oh, you agree, too? -Oh, Georg, this is the way I look at it. There was a man who was dying, they were giving him the last rites, and they asked him, "Do you renounce the devil and all his works?" and he said, "Well, at this point, I'd prefer not to make any enemies." -Georg, if they should invade us, would you defy them? -Yes. -You realize what might happen to you, to your property? -To your children. -To everyone close to you. To Elsa, to me. -Well, what would you do if they come? -Well, what anyone with any sense would do -- sit tight and wait for it all to blow over. -And you think it will? -Well, one thing's sure -- nothing you can do can make any difference. -Yes, so don't be so serious, darling.

I'm going to miss them. -Captain -- Oh! Beg your pardon. -Oh, Maria. Oh, Georg, you didn't tell me Fraulein Maria was back. I'm delighted. -Thank you. Captain, the children would like to know if they could take a holiday from their lessons tomorrow so that we can go on a picnic. -Yes, I don't mind. -That'll make them very happy. And may I be permitted to wish you happiness, too, Frau Schrader? Captain, the children have told me you're going to be married. -I'm afraid the children were wrong, dear. Well, I must finish my packing if I'm to get back to Vienna. -Auf Wiedersehen, Georg. Goodbye, Maria. -I'm sorry if I said something I shouldn't have said. -You did say the wrong thing, but you said it at the right time. -The children, they told me you were going to marry Frau Schrader. -We found we just couldn't go the same way. That door has shut. -Sister Margaretta always says, "When God shuts a door..." -I know. He opens a window. Maria? Why did you run away to the abbey? What made you come back? -The Mother Abbess.

Then one day... one night... all of a sudden, it stands before you. -Yes. -I look at you now, and I realize this is not something that has just happened.

That was not just an ordinary dance, was it? -I hadn't danced since I was very little. It's quite different after you've grown up, isn't it? -Yes. Yes, quite different. -It is different. -Your whole life will be different now, Maria. I'll take you anywhere you want to go, give you anything you wish. -But I don't want to go anywhere.

When is Captain Von Trapp returning? -Who knows, when a man is on his honeymoon? -These are not times for joking. It's been four days since the Anschluss. This is the only house in the province that is not flying the flag of the Third Reich. -You mean the flag with the black spider on it? -Brigitta. -Do you permit such remarks in this house? Who are you? -I am Maximilian Detweiler, First Secretary to the Ministry of Education and Culture. -That was the old regime. - No, in the old regime, I was Third Secretary. Now I am First Secretary. -Good. Then you can order them to fly the flag. -Captain Von Trapp wouldn't -- I mean, I take my orders only from Captain Von Trapp. -You take your orders from us! And so does the Captain. Heil! -Heil. -Why was he so cross? -Everybody's cross these days. -Is Father going to be in trouble? -He doesn't have to be.

Day after tomorrow, you must all be ready to leave at 11:00 in the morning. -Uncle Max, are you sure this is going to be okay with Father? -He will be pleased and proud. -Liesl, do you think so? -Brigitta, don't you trust me? -No. -Well, anyway, the bus will leave at 11:00 sharp. -Fraulein Liesl, see what I have here? -Oh, that's Father's luggage. -Yes, they're back! -They're back! They're back! -Now, Liesl, they'll have such a lot to tell us. Let us not be in any hurry to tell them... -Oh, Max! -Ah, Georg! We weren't expecting you till next week. -Max, it's good you're here. There's much I want to know. -Oh, children, we missed you so very much. -What did you miss most? -We missed hearing all that noise you make in the morning. -That noise you make, telling each other to be quiet. We missed climbing upstairs to say good night to you. -We missed hearing you sing. -You're just in time to hear us sing. Look, Father, we're going to sing at the Kaltzberg Festival Friday night. -Let me see that. Max, are you responsible for this? -Georg, I've just been waiting for an opportunity to talk to you. -You can't talk your way out of this one. -Oh, presents! -Let's open them in the nursery. -Now, Georg, I had to make a last-minute decision. I-I know it's very fortunate to be able to enter them at all. They'll be the talk of the festival, seven children in one family -- -Not my family. -The committee heard them. They were enchanted. -Really, Max? What did they say? -Oh, you've never heard such praise. -Georg, did you hear? -The Von Trapp Family does not sing in public. -But if they make people happy... -And for the festival. People come from all over the world. -It is out of the question! -Georg, it's for Austria. -There is no Austria. -But the Anschluss happened peacefully. I mean, let's at least be grateful for that. -Grateful? To these swine? -Oh, Maria, he must at least pretend to work with these people. I mean, I admire the way he feels, but you must convince him. He has to compromise. -No, Max, no. -Maria, you must. -Max, I can't ask Georg to be less than what he is. - All right. Then I shall speak to him. I mean, if these children don't sing in that festival, well, it'll be a reflection on Austria. And it wouldn't do me any good. -Maria, I've always known you loved us children. Now I know you love Father. -Oh, I do, Liesl. I love him very much. -How can you be sure? -Because I don't think first of myself anymore. I think first of him. I now know how to spend my love. ♪ A bell is no bell till you ring it ♪ ♪ A song is no song till you sing it ♪ ♪ And love in your heart wasn't put there to stay ♪ ♪ Love isn't love till you give it away ♪ ♪ When you're 16 going on 17 ♪ Waiting for life to start ♪ Somebody kind who touches your mind ♪ ♪ Will suddenly touch your heart ♪ -♪ When that happens, after it happens ♪ ♪ Nothing is quite the same ♪ Somehow you know you'll jump up and go ♪ ♪ If ever he calls your name -♪ Gone are the old ideas of life ♪ ♪ The old ideas grow dim ♪ Lo and behold, you're someone's wife ♪ ♪ And you belong to him ♪ You may think this kind of adventure ♪ ♪ Never may come to you ♪ Darling, 16 going on 17 ♪ Wait a year ♪ Or two -♪ I'll wait ♪ A year -♪ Or two -Rolf! Oh, Rolf! I'd like you to meet my mother, my new mother. -Rolf, I'm glad to meet you, finally. -I have a telegram for Captain Von Trapp. -You stay here with Liesl. I'll take it to him. -I'm under orders to make sure the Captain gets it. -I'm sure you can trust me to give it to him. -I have my orders. -Silly. They're married. -Ah, Franz, this telegram is to be delivered into the hands of Captain Von Trapp. -Heil. -Heil! -Rolf? -Even Franz? -Yes, even Franz. Even me. Even everybody in Nonnberg, except for the great Captain Von Trapp. If he knows what's good for him, he'll come to the Reich's side. -Rolf, don't talk like that. -And if he doesn't, he better get out of the country. There are things that happen today to a man like him. He better get out quick. Just remember what I've said before it's too late. You remember, too. -Oh, Liesl, don't cry. -How could he turn on Father like that? -Maybe he wasn't threatening your father. Maybe he was warning him. -Liesl. -What is it, Georg? -I didn't think I would have to face a decision this soon. -Berlin has offered me a commission in their Navy. -Well? -I can't just brush this aside. I admit it would be exciting to have a ship under me again. What I mean is, it would be a relief and comfort to know that you and the children are safe. But it also means... Please, Maria, help me. -Georg, whatever you decide will be my decision. -We'll have to get out of Austria right away. -You'll have to leave tonight, now. -Not without my family. And we can't just pick up and leave. They'll be watching us now. We'll have to plan. We'll have to have time. -Sir? Admiral Von Schreiber of the Navy of the Third Reich is here to see you. -Thank you, Franz. They didn't give us time. -Then we'll have to make time. -We must be careful. -What's going on? Stormtroopers? This is what I was afraid of. -Max, you stay with Georg. Liesl, find the children, quickly! -Admiral Von Schreiber, may I present Herr Detweiler? Max, I think you know Herr Zeller. Would you gentlemen care to sit down? -We are here on business. -Captain Von Trapp, a telegram was sent to you three days ago. -I've just received it, sir. I've been away. I've only been home half an hour. -Captain Von Trapp has just returned from his honeymoon, sir. -Congratulations, Captain. -Thank you, sir. -Your record in the war is very well-remembered by us, Captain. -It's good to hear you say that, sir. -Let's get to the point! -If you don't mind. In our Navy, we hold you in very high regard. That explains why I am here. Having had no answer to our telegram, the high command has sent me in person. -That's very flattering, sir, but I've had no time to -- -I'm here to present you with your commission. -I'm deeply conscious of the honor -- -And your orders are to report immediately to the naval base of Bremerhaven. -Immediately? Oh, I'm afraid that would be impossible for you, Georg. Admiral, may I present my wife, the Baroness Von Trapp? Admiral Von Schreiber. -Madam. -What I mean, sir, is that we are all singing in the Kaltzberg Festival on Friday night. You see, the Von Trapp Family singers here in the program. -It has been arranged by the Ministry of Education and Culture. -Friday night? This is Wednesday. It is only a matter of two days. It might be possible. You could report to Bremerhaven by Monday. -Admiral! -Is there a telephone I could use? -Uh, this way, Admiral. If there remain any questions, perhaps adding the weight of my voice might help to smooth over any ruffled feathers. -It gives here only the names of the children. -It says the Von Trapp Family singers. -I am the head of the Von Trapp family. -It's hard to believe, Captain Von Trapp -- you, singing in a concert. -Herr Zeller, you may believe what you choose. -Ah, it doesn't say here what you're going to sing. What are you going to sing, Captain? -It's your privilege to come to the concert and hear us. -I'd like to hear you sing now. Sing what you're going to sing in the concert.

Thank you. Uh, just a moment. I have an announcement that concerns you. Well, our festival concert has reached its conclusion, except, of course, we don't know what that conclusion will be. Our distinguished judges are putting their heads together to arrive at their decision. And while we are waiting, I think there should be an encore. It seems this might be the last opportunity the Von Trapp family will have to sing together for a long, long time. I have just been informed that Captain Von Trapp leaves immediately after this concert for his new command in the Naval Forces of the Third Reich. A guard of honor has arrived to escort the Captain directly from this hall to the naval base at Bremerhaven.

For this honor, the judges have named the trio of the Saengerbund of Herwegen! The second award has been given to Fraulein Schweiger, the first soloist of the choir of St. Agatha's Church in Morbach. Uh, Fraulein. The first prize, the highest musical honor in the ausmache... goes to the Family Von Trapp! The Von Trapp family! -Keep quiet. -Please, everybody -- -Nobody move! -Call the guard! -We need to call headquarters. -Where are they?! -Quiet! -A chtung! Take the first row! -Arrest that man! -All clear, sir. -Keep looking. -Nothing here. -Keep moving. -Go that way. Over there. -Sir. -Look around the back. -Anything? -Clear! -All clear! -Clear! -They've only five more rooms to search. Shouldn't be too long now. -How many of them are there? -I counted only eight stormtroopers and their officer. -Sister Margaretta, we didn't know we'd put the abbey in this danger. -It's outrageous. The church has always been a sanctuary. -Not for these people. This is the third time they've searched the abbey. That's why we put you out here in the garden. They always search the inside, never the outside. -Isn't this God's house? -Shh! -Not in here. -Yes, darling. -Then why did He let them in? -We all must be very, very quiet. I'll let you know when they've gone. -When they've gone, can we go home? -No, darling. We have a long drive ahead of us. -Liesl, let's all stay close to each other. -Liesl. -Lieutenant! -What is it?! There's no one here, sir! -All right! Come along! --Oh. Liesl. Liesl. Thank God. -They've gone. -Quick. Go inside. Children, quick. In you go. You go. Reverend Mother, we are sorry we brought this on you. -Reverend Mother, we can never thank you. -As soon as it's safe, we'll start. We hid our car deep in the woods. -The car will do you no good. They've left a guard on the road in front of the gate. -I've been listening to the wireless. All the roads are blocked. The borders are closed. -I've always thought of these mountains as my friends, standing there, protecting us. Now it seems they've become my enemies. -Never your enemies. Haven't you read? "I shall lift up mine eyes unto the hills from whence cometh my help." -Georg, I know that mountain as well as I know these gardens, and so do you. Once we're over that mountain, we're in Switzerland. -But the children. -We can help them. -Father. We can do it without help. -You'll have help. -For ye shall go out with joy and be led forth with peace, and the mountains and hills shall break forth before you into singing. ♪ Follow every byway ♪ Till you find your dream ♪ A dream that will need -♪ Ah-ah-ah -♪ All the love you can give -♪ Ah-ah-ah-ah -♪ Every day of your life -♪ Ah-ah-ah -♪ For as long as you live -♪ Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah -♪ Climb ev'ry mountain ♪ Ford ev'ry stream ♪ Follow ev'ry rainbow ♪ Till you ♪ Find your ♪ Dre-e-e-e-am -To find out more about this and other "Great Performances" programs, Find us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter.
