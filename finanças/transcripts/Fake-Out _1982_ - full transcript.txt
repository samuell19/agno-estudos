(light-hearted instrumental music) - Louise. Louise. - [Woman] Yes, sir? - [Man] Put the books away, I'm going home. - [Woman] Yes, Mr. Spiveck. (people chattering) Good night, Mr. Spiveck. - Night. - [Dealer] The lady banker shares a six. - [Spiveck] Good night. (slot machine rattles) (insects chirp) (car revs) (Spiveck grunts) Another hick with his house on his back. Move it. (grunts) Come on. Come on, I haven't got all night. Let's go! Now turn it this way. Yeah, that's right. Very good. Now go back, go back, go back! Turn the wheel this way. My own place and I gotta direct traffic. All right, that's it, you're clean. Go, you've got it. Come on, come on, you got it. (screams) (tires screech) (low moaning) (tense instrumental music) (gun bangs) (dramatic instrumental music) (jazzy lounge music) ♫ Your eyes are so tender ♫ They speak by themselves ♫ You use them to move me ♫ You move me so well ♫ I can't seem to help it ♫ And God knows I try ♫ I just can't avoid ♫ The effect of those ♫ Eyes (percussive disco music) ♫ No, I'm not complainin' ♫ Questionin' why ♫ I can't resist you ♫ Why should I try ♫ I've been waitin' for love ♫ All of my life ♫ Dream came true ♫ When I looked into ♫ Those eyes ♫ Those eyes ♫ Those eyes ♫ Ooh, you know I want you ♫ I got to have ya ♫ Oh I need you near me ♫ To have and to hold ♫ The way that you touch me ♫ Makes me lose control ♫ I've never known ♫ This feeling before ♫ If this is love ♫ Well give me more ♫ Those eyes ♫ Ooh, they tell lies ♫ Those eyes ♫ How they mesmerize ♫ Those eyes ♫ I get hypnotized ♫ But I'm not complainin' ♫ Questionin' why ♫ I can't resist you ♫ Why should I try ♫ I've been waitin' for love ♫ All of my life ♫ My dream came true ♫ And that dream is you ♫ Those eyes ♫ Those eyes, those eyes, those eyes ♫ Those eyes, those eyes, those eyes ♫ Those eyes, those eyes, those eyes ♫ Those eyes, those eyes, those eyes ♫ Those eyes, those eyes, those eyes ♫ Those eyes, those eyes, those eyes ♫ Those eyes, those eyes, those eyes ♫ Those eyes (applause) ♫ The way that I need you ♫ Can't be denied ♫ I can see my love ♫ Reflected inside ♫ Those eyes (applause and cheers) (bluesy instrumental music) - [Woman] You're an unusual case, Bobbie. Fast-rising career, very talented. - Thank you. - Everything going for ya. Can't understand why you'd wanna get yourself in here. - I didn't ask for it. - Oh but you did. When the court offered you immunity in exchange for what you know about your boyfriend Danny Parelli's involvement in the Spiveck killing, you refused. - So they put me in a prison. - You are under a judge's detentional custody for being in contempt of court. You can get out any time you want. - Any time I wanna hurt someone I trust. - Have it your way. Captain Johnson is in charge of your cell block. She'll process you through. Warren, I know you think your boyfriend's high-powered lawyers are gonna get you out. But the authorities can make it very difficult. So you could be in here for a long time. Your quickest out is to agree to testify. (tinkling instrumental music) - [Prisoner] Hey, what a lollipop. - [Prisoner] Woo, amateur night's gonna get better now. Mm hmm! - Don't pay any attention to them, they jump on every new girl like that. You'll do the same if you're here long enough. - [Prisoner] All right, Bobbie! You gonna sing for us, huh, Warren? - They know me? - Inmates are well informed. They run the prison, we just keep them in. - [Prisoner] Welcome to the box, chirper. We're gonna get sung to sleep every night, huh? - [Prisoner] Johnson, put her in here! I ain't had a lullaby since I was a baby. (shouting) - Don't let them see that. You'll be all right if you mind your own business. (shouting) Fix it up with whatever you can get from the outside. And, Bobbie, try to find something to take an interest in, something to pass the time. Because time's all there is here. (bluesy instrumental music) All right, girls, settle down. (shouting) (bluesy instrumental music) - Okay, girls, now place your right hand on your right hip, your left hand way above the head, and stretch. Two, three, four, five, six, seven, change and right, two, three, now change, flat, two, three, four, five, six, seven, side, and stretch, all the way down to the kneecaps, four, five, six, seven, eight, okay, come on, let's jump. Right, left, right, left, right, left, right, come on! Right, left, shift your weight, five, six, seven, eight, right, left, right, left, right! - [Johnson] Four o'clock already? - Uh huh. - Come on, balance, girls. Pretend we're goin' right out the front gate! (women shout) Right, left, right, left, and front. - I see her boyfriend got her another new outfit. A present a day keeps the jury away. - Take it easy on her, Rudinsky. It's tough enough doing time without ever having been convicted of a crime. - What kind of time is she doing? Her cell is better furnished than my house. - She's not doing it for what he sends her. A girl like her does it because of emotion. For him. - Right, left, right, left. Come on! - Go on home, Johnson. I've got the cattle for the night. - Three, four, five, six, seven, and up to the chin! Two, three, four, five, six, to the side! - All right, ladies! - Three, four, five. - One more time. We'll pick 'em up and pack 'em in. - Okay, this last one's for Wooly. Strippers use this one a lot, Wooly. You get it down right, you might have a new career when you get out. (women giggle) - And one. - When they open, a joint in the stockyards. - On a silly pepper patch. - Right, left, front, back, right, left, front, back. - All right, who's the wise ass? - Yeah, peelin' in the pepper patch. Give her even more of a red ass. Take it off, Wooly. (women shout) - Back, left, front. - All except for the bag over your head. - Come on! Come on out here. Chicken shit! Who's got the guts enough to own up? Goddamn it! - Okay, let's do it, come on. A couple weeks, you'll look as good as Roberta. - [Prisoner] Watch yourself, buttermilk. - Come on, Wooly. Do it. Front, back, right, come on! Front, back, right. Front, back. - Just kick back, Wooly. All right, wrap it up. - Front, back, right, left, front, back, right, left. This one tightens the stomach muscles. It'll also relieve other things like tension, know what I mean? (laughing) Front, back, right, left, front, back, right, and right and left, and right and left, and right and left. - Ah, this is the one I like the best! (laughing) - Hot damn, where's my man? - You got it, Candy. Right and left. - Do it, do it, Mama! - Roll it back. - Mmm! - Oh baby! (screams) - Back and front. - Oh God I wish I had on tighter underwear. (laughing and shouting) (rapping) - Time! (shouting) Shake 'em out, chicks. I wanna get ya fed, in bed, so I can relax and watch a little TV tonight. - Your old football team playin' on the tube tonight, Rudinsky? - When'd you retire, Rudinsky? - [Prisoner] They kicked her out 'cause she was too dangerous! - And she didn't even wear pads! - All right, zip your lips and wiggle your asses. - [Prisoner] Come on. (giggling) (water patters) (tense instrumental music) - What do you want? - We just wanna show you how much we appreciate your exercises. (tense instrumental music) - Don't let them make you do this, Roberta. (chuckling) (water patters) - Relax. Enjoy. (sinuous instrumental music) (fleshy smack) (sinuous instrumental music) (percussive disco music) - Rudinsky! (pounding disco music) Rudinsky! (shouting) (pounding disco music) Rudinsky! (shouting) (pounding disco music) - [Rudinsky] Shut up! - Rudinsky, I want out. - And I wanna hit the sack with Paul Newman, but that ain't gonna happen here neither. - I'll talk. - Shut up and get back between those silk sheets or I'll fix your face so your boyfriend will send you a silk hood. - I don't mean what happened in the shower. I'll testify against Danny Parelli. - That's fine, I'll tell Warden Curtis first thing Monday. - Uh uh, you tell her now. - Impossible. Friday night, she's gone for the weekend. - Wrong, Rudinsky. It's Saturday morning, and I want out now! Or I don't talk at all. Any time or any place. - You know, you get a pretty good nose for a con job, being on the force as long as me, and, Miss, somethin' about you smells. - It's probably the homemade soap they made us use in there. Wait'll I get a hot bath with some good stuff. - You know what I'm talkin' about, little girl. After three months, suddenly wakin' up everybody, sayin' you wanna blow the whistle on your boyfriend. Come on! - I was told my mouth was the key to my cell. I just decided to use it, that's all. - The attorney general has his doubts, too, but he wants Parelli so bad he's willing to go along with ya. Personally, (chuckles) I think you're strokin' us. - Stroking you would only give me calluses, Lieutenant Thurston. (Thurston chuckles) Is everything set up? - Oh, a suite at the Riviera Hotel for two days. Monday, into court. - Great. My own private suite with a hot bath, terrific. - Oh yeah. But, uh, not completely private. Clint here will be with you. - [Bobbie] Since when did the state of Nevada go into the male escort business? - I'll be there for your protection, Miss Warren. - Protection? Just get me to the hotel and leave me alone. - You're not gonna be left alone, lady. You're still under detention till Monday, after you talk. If you're let alone to roam around free, Parelli might decide to shut your mouth, permanently. - That's ridiculous. (quiet instrumental music) (tires screech) (car revs) (jangling instrumental music) - [Announcer] Happy Times tour of Las Vegas now loading. Last call for Happy Times tour. - [Woman] Here you are. (people chattering) (jangling instrumental music) - Beautiful. I'm home. (slots rattles) (people chattering) - Yeah, well, keep an eye on her while go check on the damn suite. - All right. - Come on, girl, we can get the room later. I spotted me a hot one. - Oh no you don't. I get first money this trip. - I need one of them paper cups for my lucky buck. You know, I'd rather hit a jackpot than a flight of glory. Yoo-hoo! - Now, girl, don't act like a yard dog. - Take your bags, sir? - Uh, no thanks. - [Bellboy] I'm Vic, stayin' with us long? - [Clint] Just the weekend. - [Vic] If there's anything you need, please ask for me. (slot machine rattles) - Hey, lady, what the hell do you think you're doin'? I just put a dollar in the doohicky. You don't go around pullin' somebody's paddle. (shouting) (bell ringing) (clapping) - [Thurston] Annie, let me have the key to Room 3122. - Thank you, lady! Thank you, sweetheart! - [Bobbie] Great! - Hi, Bobbie! - Hi, Riddy, how are ya? - Bobbie! - Hi, Sue! - [Announcer] Mr. Bart, Mr. Bart, long distance. - 25-A. - Thank you. - What are you tryin' to do? - Play keno, if you don't break my concentration. - Keno. - 67, 77, there. It's my own system. I play all seven numbers with seven in them. - [Clint] That's eight numbers. - Whose system is this anyway? Gimme two dollars. Come on, remember the deal? Weekend paid for? Gimme two dollars. (people chattering) - Mark 500. - Mark 500. - 57, 67, and 77. - You got it. - (chuckles) You're beautiful. Gimme a stack. - Marker down. - [Gamer] You wanna sign the mark? Hey. - Two for you and three for me. - Thank you. - Hey. - What, are you kiddin'? - [Announcer] Security to Versailles Room. Security to the Versailles Room, please. - [Announcer] And continuing on the red game, 12, 71, 38, 65. - [Clint] Are you always this lucky? I don't see any sevens up there. - Gimme four dollars. - Look, I. - Come on, we'll hit this time for sure. I feel it. - Feel your way up from there to the room. Come on, let's go. - How 'bout you? You wanna get in on a sure thing? - Yeah, sure, the game's a tourist trap. You're better off blowin' bubbles. Move it. - She likes keno. - Hey, hey, jackpot! - Hey! - Hey, come on over here. Roll these bones with me. I'll split it with ya. That lady over there? She pulled my thing and give me a jackpot. - [Bobbie] All right, all right. What were you before you became a cop? A sumo wrestler? - No. I was a principal at a daycare center. - [Announcer] Paging Priscilla Kemp. Priscilla Kemp, phone call. - You know, I didn't get out of a cell just to be locked up in a room! - [Thurston] Right, you came out to do some talking, and I intended to see that you do just that. Now if you've got an itch for somethin' else, put some powder on it. - [Bobbie] When I get an itch, Thurston, I scratch it. - I bet you do, kitten. I just bet you do. (bluesy instrumental music) Great eyes. - I don't like it. - What are you complaining about? You're being comped by the state. - I want another one. - Well, (chuckles) you know sometimes in life, Miss Warren, people suffer these terrible, terrible hardships. But they learn to live with them. And you will, too. (comical instrumental music) Now you call room service for anything you need. - Good. Do you think they could send up a magician to make you two disappear? (chuckling) - I don't envy you, Clint. - I can handle it. - Remember, Parelli's wired, so watch out. If he believes this chick is gonna talk, we're gonna have our hands full. - I won't let you down. - That's why I picked you. Oh, uh, (chuckles) Ms. Warren, forgive me, but I'm the suspicious sort, so I assume that your ploy to get out of jail was to see Mr. Parelli. Well, I took it upon myself to check his whereabouts for ya. He's in New York. He got hungry for some homemade lasagna. (chuckles) See ya later, Miss Warren. - [Bobbie] (sighs) Only if my luck keeps running bad, Lieutenant. - I'm gonna go outside and, uh-- - Check around? - Right. (bluesy instrumental music) - Well, what are your plans for the weekend? - Thurston will let us know, Miss Warren. - Oh. You can call me Bobbie. This may be a blind date, but it's not formal. - Okay, Bobbie. The rules are simple-- - No, no rules, no regulations, and no routines. I've had enough of them for the last three months. Here I am in Vegas and I'm stuck with the Scoutmaster and his trainee. - What are your plans for right now? - I think I'll have a bath and wait for your little hot line to ring. Is there anything in the manual against that? - No. - Oh. - Just don't hold your head under water too long. - Cute. Oh, boy scout, do me a favor, will you? Would you, uh, blow your little bugle in about a half hour so I can show up for roll call? (light instrumental music) (water patters) (knob rattles) Damn! Vic. Vic. (light instrumental music) (phone rings) Hello, is, is Vic there? - Yes, welcome to the Riviera Hotel in Las Vegas Nevada, Miss Warren. We have three fine restaurants for your eating pleasure, and in the Versailles Showroom tonight, the Miss Cosmos contest, featuring the most beautiful women on earth. (screams) - All cops are rats and sneaks and finks, and I wouldn't trust any of them as far as I could throw them! - What's the matter now? - I feel dirty from the company I've been keeping. I'm gonna take a bath. Order me a bottle of wine, and keep out! (doors slam and rattle) Damn it! (whimpering) (Bobbie groans) (tense instrumental music) (people shouting) - [Gambler] Cover the hard numbers. - [Gambler] Come on. - 200 on a hard eight. 200 on a hard eight. Gimme a little kiss, honey. - 500 on the eight. - That's a bet. - [Gambler] Here we go. - [Gambler] Seven out. - [Dealer] Seven out, clear the front line. - Son of a bitch. - That's all right, we're doin' all right. We'll get 'em next time. - [Man In Brown] Sign here, Lieutenant Thurston. - [Dealer] Comin' out, get your bets placed. - [Man In Brown] Thank you. - [Dealer] We got the 11 here. $14 over here. (knocking) - Who is it? - Room service. Hello. - How ya doin'? - Where would ya like this? - Ah, just put it behind the bar, okay? - Okay. Hey, ya, ya havin' any luck, huh? - Well, you know how it is up here. - Listen, how many glasses would you like, sir? - Just one. (comical instrumental music) - I'm ready for the audition, Mr. Salthasar. (comical instrumental music) Are you sure this is for a singing role? - Uh. She (chuckles). - You know, my mother doesn't want me to do anything that won't help my career. She says I, I can't work at anything but singing until I'm 18. (cork pops) - Oh, you see-- - I understand. Will there be anything else, sir? - Well, no, uh. Look, let me give you a little-- - No, no, no thank you. - [Clint] Okay. (door slams) - [Waiter] Degenerate! (giggling) - Cute, that's cute, yeah. - [Bobbie] I've been called better than cute. - Some wine? - Mm hmm. (light instrumental music) Thanks. Mm, it's good. Have some. - Can't. - Aw, is little boy scout on duty? How about if I pour it into a canteen for ya? - Look, I'm just here for your protection. Give me a little respect, huh? - You really take your work seriously, don't you? - Don't you in your work? - You're right. - Look, why don't you get outta that towel? - Oh? - That's not what I meant. I meant, get into a dress or, uh. I didn't mean. - I don't think you know what you mean. Or what you want. And for sure you'll never know what you missed. (Bobbie groans) - [Clint] What, what's, what's? - Can't wear any of these. - Why, what's the matter with 'em? - [Bobbie] Smell. - It's cloth. - Prison. Can I have new ones? - Oh, I, I don't, that couldn't be approved till Monday, uh, and all I have here is $20. - That's enough! - For clothes? - For blackjack. - No, I'm not gonna throw my money away like that. - Just lend me the money, just $20. Come on, please. - Okay. Thurston has to say it's okay. - [Announcer] Paging O.W. Thurston, please. - [Thurston] Yeah? - [Bobbie] Detective Thurston? - Yes, Miss Warren. - [Bobbie] Can Clint and I play some blackjack? - Well you're better off there than at that keno game. - Then it's okay? - [Thursdton] Well, let me speak to Clint. - Okay, go ahead, talk to him. - Yeah? - Not bad. I mean, she's safer in the casino than anywhere else. - Okay, well-- - Come on, let's go! - Will ya keep an eye out for us? - Yeah. And any other suspicious looking characters. Excuse me. Your face looks familiar. Do I know you from somewhere? - Possibly, if you've ever been to San Francisco. That's where I reside. - Oh, I'm sorry, I mistook you for somebody else. - Please, may I buy you a drink? - Oh, no thanks. (chuckles) Cool it. - This machine's tight as my corset. What's Harry gonna say when he calls and we haven't even checked in yet? - [Woman In Green] He'll think I'm gettin' what he's not given me anymore, and I am, fun, yoo-hoo. - [Clint] You bet hunches on this or do you use another system? - Nah, that's a crazy way. I control the cards mentally. I just concentrate on the cards I want and get them, that's all. - Well, this is all ya get. - Right. Money plays. - Ya bet the whole thing? - Mm hmm. Blackjack, blackjack, blackjack, blackjack, blackjack. - [Clint] 21, hey! - Jack. - I don't know. Let's go. - Uh uh. That's not enough money for a dress. - [Clint] Two 10s, good. (chuckles) - Very good. But-- - You're gonna split the 10s? - That's correct. (laughing) - [Clint] All right! - [Dealer] Pay 19. - Hello, Mr. C, how are ya? What can I do for ya? - I'll tell ya what you can do for me, you can get rid of this ditzy dame over here, that's what. - Sorry, I can't do that. After all, that's her money. - But she don't know how to play the game. - Well maybe you're right. Only how come that's our money she's playin' with? It'll be all right. Let me get ya a fresh drink, okay? - Yeah, thanks. - 17. Stay, stay. - Hit me. - [Clint] You got it! (laughing) - [Bobbie] I told you. Never doubt, boy scout. - Hit me. (grunts) - Aw. Oh yes. - Betting two this time. (laughing) - How 'bout that? All right! - Blackjack. - But that's good, it's blackjack. - Sure. - [Dealer] 17. - All right. Well, we got, uh, quite a bit over there. Look, we got lots of money. Let's get outta here. - Uh uh, one more hand. I tell ya what, I'm gonna concentrate real hard this time, for you, too. - Thanks a lot. - So, bet 'em up. - Go. - Blackjack, blackjack, blackjack, blackjack, blackjack. (shouting) - [Clint] Ya did it! (laughing) (grunting) - Why don't you get outta here? - Come on, let's get to the dress shop. - Yeah, you can buy a whole wardrobe now. - You're not kidding. - Bye bye. - Let's go cash 'em in. - Can I play for 50 cents here? - Here's your 20 back. Maybe next time you'll trust me and go partners. - Maybe I won't completely distrust you. Where to now? - Clothes, beautiful clothes, come on. - [Woman In Green] That's my machine! - You don't like it? - Maybe for your mother, not for you. - Good. - What? - Well, I wanted to see if your taste in women's clothes is as bad as your taste in professions. - [Woman] Ted, you'll spoil me. - [Ted] Rotten. - Ted, no, I don't need any new clothes. - Now if you're going to be a star, and I guarantee you will be, my beautiful bride, you're going to have to dress like one. Now come along. - [Bobbie] This one's not bad, that's kinda cute. - That's nice, I like that. - [Bobbie] Nah, it's too much fabric. - Oh, did you treat all your wives this good? - [Ted] Please, let's not inflict old diseases on such a glorious birth of love. Now here, goddess of the future, try it on. - Hi! - Hi. - Exquisite! Forgive me, but someone as lovely as you must be involved in the arts. Permit me, Ted King, theatrical manager extraordinaire. This is my latest discovery Michelle, whom you'll be seeing shortly on motion picture screens, billboards, posters, and magazine covers all over the country, and you are? - Bobbie Warren, I'm a singer. - Ah. Well, it's a living, lucrative living, provided you have inspired management. Mr. Warren. - I'm Clint Morgan. I'm-- - He's my fashion consultant. - I knew it! I knew it. It's that, that look of greatness that I'm able to spot immediately. You know it must be true, water seeks its own level. That's why I was compelled to talk to you. (chuckling) - So, uh, you're an actress? - Oh, I will be. I was a waitress until Ted discovered me. - Oh, when was that? - Oh, yesterday. Oh, and it was love at first sight. We were even married today. - You see, I take a personal interest in my clients. - Yeah. - I, uh, I have another little sideline that you may be interested in. I know that people in your business from time to time need, oh, a little inspiration, and I happen to have some, some dynamite smoke. I can give it to you for real cheap. Just pass the word around, and spread the business my way, huh? - No thanks. - If that doesn't work, I also happen to have some (snorts) some heavenly powder which will mellow you out really nice. - [Clint] Uh uh. - Stop it, Ted. I mean, he said no. He said he'd stop it if I married him and he could make me a star. If you don't stop it, Ted, I'll cancel our agreement. - I just wanna trade for some fashion advice. Maybe help her career, it's just, it's just business! How 'bout a drink? - Maybe later. - [Clint] No. - We'll be around if you change your mind. (dramatic instrumental music) - I thought you were gonna bust him right there. - Hey, baby, accidentally snort. - Yeah, and you turned about as white as that powder he's peddling. - It was almost worth blowing my cover to flash my badge and watch him faint. - I bet you he would've, too. - Yeah. - I tell ya what, I'm gonna take a hot bath before I put on these new clothes, and then we'll go and have dinner, okay? - Okay. - [News Anchor] In tonight's news, a near collision of a 40-foot tractor trailer and an auto-transport rig across from the Riviera resulted in an overturned power pole. The vehicles were moved to the side of the road, and power has been restored to the affected areas. (slurping) (bouncing instrumental music) And so, for this evening in the desert, that's all the news, sports, and weather. - [Bobbie] Clint! - [News Anchor] On behalf of myself, Barb Wiseman, and the rest of the weekend news team. - [Bobbie] Clint! - Yeah? - Bring me a glass of wine, please? - [News Anchor] Stay tuned for another in our series. - Sure. - [News Anchor] The three misfits. - [Clint] Room service. - Wine, please. - [Clint] Here ya go. - Thanks. - Hey now, that's a nice outfit. But I wouldn't go out in the rain in it. - My designer disapproves? - I like the hat though. (giggling) - Clint? - Yeah? - Stay. Please? Come on, huh? (tinkling instrumental music) Funny, isn't it? In prison, all you can thank about is being alone, all by yourself. I was never a girl who could take being alone for too long. - I've heard stories of prison. - They're true. I like you, boy scout. - I think it's time to turn in my good conduct medal. (phone rings) (giggling) - [Bobbie] My God! (phone rings) Let it ring. (Clint chuckles) - I can't, it might be Thurston. (phone rings) Yeah, yeah, hello. - Yeah hello? - Thurston. Hi, it's me. - Really? You sound, uh, different. - Oh? - Now what the hell's goin' on up there? - Nothing, nothing's going on, Thurston. - Now look, kid, you better watch out for that girl, and remember what you're here for. You're supposed to keep your eyes on her, Romeo, just your eyes. Capiche? - [Clint] Yeah. - I want ya to bring her down here for dinner. (Bobbie giggling) - As soon as she gets dressed. Uh-- - Dressed? - Puts her clothes on. The, the new clothes that we just got. - Now! I'll make a reservation for ya at the Ristorante. And I wanna see ya go by here in five minutes. - [Hitman] Pew. (TV chatters) (laughing) (traffic hums) - [Clint] Here it is right here. - [Bobbie] One game of keno before dinner. - Are ya still gonna bet the same, uh, system? - Well of course. - How long you been betting that? - Seven years. Seven years, that's great! It's magic time. The combination is right. 17, 27. - Hey! Hey, you two! - 37. - Hey! - Hi! - Yoo-Hoo! - Hi there! - Uh oh, he's still loose. - Do you know, it seems impossible, but you are even more ravishing in that outfit than before. And you must be the envy of every man in the casino. Do you think we could persuade you to join us in some libation before we hit the tables? - Uh, no thanks, we're just on our way to dinner. - After we break the keno bank. - Keno? How quaint. Do you know that I am as perceptive with numbers as I am with people? Keno it is. We break the bank, and then dinner, on me. - Oh isn't he wonderful? He shares his gifts with everybody, just like he said he did. - Yeah. - Now, after thoroughly looking at that board and the numbers that were drawn, my instincts tell me that we go with numbers that are not there now. - Oh? - Could you help me? I don't know much about this game. As a matter of fact, I don't know a thing about it. - It's simple. You just mark the numbers you wanna play, pay the money, and wait. - [Woman] Like this? - You won't make much off three numbers. - Oh. (thumping instrumental music) - Uh, here's my card, Clint. Play it for me. I, I have to go to the powder room. It's right over there. I won't be long. - Okay. - Oh, I'll go with her. I gotta redo my entire face. - [Man In Glasses] Only the gods could improve on such perfection, my love! - Makeup makes it better. - Now pay attention. I'm going to play 15 numbers because I think that so many numbers are gonna hit it big, am I right? - Right. - Right. Of course I'm right. (exciting instrumental music) - [Clint] So, tell me, how did you get into the talent management business? - Management? (chuckles) Well, Clint, long time ago, I started looking at the world and the people in it, and suddenly I realized something very basic, very simple, namely that, in back of every great person, there's an even greater person guiding them, pushing them, and I didn't want to be merely just great, and I said, "Ted, you're better than that. "You make things happen. "You are a pusher." (suspenseful instrumental music) (exciting instrumental music) - Danny, I'm so glad to see you. I missed you so much. - I missed you, too, baby. - Hold me tight. Tighter. You feel so good. - Poor kid. You had a rough time, didn't ya? - It was awful in there. I just had to get out, even for the weekend, just so you could hold me again. - That's what I told the guys. Can you believe it? Some of them thought you were really gonna talk. - Oh, you know better than that. It's just that something happened inside that kinda scared me, that's all. I was taking a shower and those girls, they-- - You sure you haven't said anything? Don't be hurt, baby. This is important business. Important people wanna be sure. - But you're sure. Aren't ya, Danny? - I'm betting you can take whatever they throw at ya. Right? - If that's what you want. - Good girl. Now I want ya to get back. - Do I have to? - They got you travelling with some very interesting company. - [Bobbie] He's just a sweet kid. But I don't wanna leave you, Danny. - No time for that, baby. I got the lawyers workin' overtime for you. I'm jumpin' all over them. We'll be together soon. Just like old times. - [Bobbie] I hope so. - Hang tough, baby. - [Dealer] 20, 50, 37. - Look at that board. Look at your ticket. Three numbers. Three numbers and you win, that's all you need, just three numbers. - They've been gone too long. - They've got lots to do. - 77. - Look at that, two numbers! Two numbers and you're home free, two numbers! - [Dealer] 14. 41. 52. 71. 57. (light instrumental music) - Sorry, sir, there's been no one in here lookin' like that. - What's goin' on? - Bobbie's gone. - Paging O.W. Thurston, Mr. O.W. Thurston, phone, please. - Wait here. - No time, they've got her! (elevator dings) - Yeah, this is Thurston. You got a page for me. - Thurston, I lost her. - Now how the hell'd that happen, Merrich? - I'm gettin' too old for footraces. I never seen a woman run so fast. - Damn. Now look, Clint's after them. You go up to the chick's suite right away, and I'll meet ya there. - Right. (suspenseful instrumental music) - [Ted] Go! - [Clint] Hey. Come here. (exciting instrumental music) Where is she? (exciting instrumental music) (tires squeal) (gun bangs) (tires screech) (gun bangs) (tires squeal) (exciting instrumental music) (guns bang) (exciting instrumental music) (tires squeal) (guns bang) (tense instrumental music) - Excuse me, could you let me in my room, please? - Sure. - Thank you. (gun clicks) (tense instrumental music) (gun whistles) (bullet thunks) (gun clicks) (gun whizzes) (bullet thunks) (gun clacks) (gun whizzes) (gun clicks) (car revs) (tires squeal) (crashing) (gun bangs) (tires squeal) (gun bangs and pops) (tires squeal) (tires screech) (popping instrumental music) (knocking) (gun whistles) (gun clicks) - [Bobbie] Who is it? - My name's Merrich, I'm a police officer, let me in. (tense instrumental music) Yes. (gun whistles) (Merrich groans) (Bobbie screams) (tires screech) - [Ted] Now what? (exciting instrumental music) - [Passenger] Up there. (exciting instrumental music) (gun bangs) - [Announcer] Here's beautiful Rita. (cheers) Rita is majoring in Latin American. (cheers and whistling) In her spare time, she enjoys listening to classical music. Thank you, Rita. Our next (speaker drowned out by car). (screaming) - You win! (screaming) (gun bangs) (crashing) (car whines) (screaming) (horn beeps) (screaming) - [Woman] Wait a minute! (comical instrumental music) - What was that? - That must be room service. (comical instrumental music) - [Man On Left] Cancel my reservation. (comical instrumental music) - [Employee] Whoa! (thudding) (comical instrumental music) (slot machine rattles) - [Man In Blue] All right! (comical instrumental music) (thudding) (tense instrumental music) (gasping and weeping) - Merrich. Gotta be Parelli. (Bobbie weeping) - He tried to kill me. He didn't believe me. I'll tell them everything. He put the screws to Spiveck's partners to sell to him. I heard him tell them he'd deal with Spiveck himself. I'll tell them everything. - [Thurston] I, uh, better get you outta here. Here. (car revs) (tires screech) (doors shatter) (tires squeal) (gun bangs) (dramatic instrumental music) (splashing) (fluttering instrumental music) (rhythmic instrumental music) - Clint! Clint! - [Thurston] Clint! - Wait there. Wait right there. - No way, we gotta get outta here now. (rhythmic instrumental music) - [Bobbie] Clint said to wait here. - [Thurston] The hell with that. You can bleed just as bad out here as you can in your own room. Let's dance, baby. (rhythmic instrumental music) (suspenseful instrumental music) (guns bang) (rhythmic instrumental music) - A guy. Son of a bitch. Stop! Stop! (tires squeal) Hold it! What the hell's going on? Where'd you disappear to? - To see Danny. - Yeah? Great. I just killed two people so you could play kissy face with some cheap hood. Thanks. - I'm sorry, Clint. He tried to get me, too. - The word's out. We better get her down to the station house. (tense instrumental music) (sirens wail) Get down. (tires screech) (gun bangs) (tires screech) (exciting instrumental music) (screaming) (tires screech) (screaming) (exciting instrumental music) (crashing) (people chattering) (screaming) (exciting instrumental music) (waltzing instrumental music) (shattering crash) (shouting) Nah, it's no good. I mean, if they're after her on the streets already, they'll figure we're gonna take her down to the station. They'll try to hit her there. Now you get over here. I'll go back and take those two goons in, try to get some information from them. You take the car and you get her outta town. Look, I want you to go to the Lake Mead Marina. My sister's husband has a boat there called the Happiness. - The Happiness. - I want you to take her aboard and stay there until I come to get you personally. Do you understand? - Right. - The Happiness. All right, go. - Thurston. - Yeah? - Can I have your gun, just in case? I don't have any more rounds. You can get more at the station. - [Thurston] All right. (tires screech) (bluesy instrumental music) - The Happiness. Happiness is a hot bath right now. I hope this tub's got hot water. (bluesy instrumental music) (gentle instrumental music) (suspenseful instrumental music) (rattling) (gentle instrumental music) That felt good. - Would you turn that off? (Clint sighs) How'd you ever get mixed up with Parelli? - I was singing in the lounge of his first place. He liked my style. He was always a gentleman. That was nice after the some of the other talent bookers in this town. He protected me. Then he tried to kill me. - You must've cared a lot for him. Go to prison to protect him. - I did. And I'd have gone back. But he didn't believe me. He didn't trust me like I trusted him. Well, it'll never happen again. - Never? - Almost never. (gentle instrumental music) (sinuous instrumental music) (thudding footsteps) - What? - Shh, shh, shh. (frogs croak) (thudding footsteps) (shattering) (guns bang) (glass shatters) (tense instrumental music) Your other friend's in the lake. - Hey. I'm glad they didn't waste ya, kid. They blew it. - Yeah. She wanted to take a hot bath. - Uh huh, yeah. And Happiness doesn't have one. - We were on the other boat. - Seven cover 11. You shoulda been at the dice tables tonight. We would've owned the joint. - You set us up. Why? - Listen, kid, in all my life, I've had these dark rain clouds hoverin' over my head around the dice tables, and always, zoop, down the tubes. And when you're a degenerate gambler like me, it's very easy for a shark like Parelli to get his hooks into ya. He's got all my markers and he was gonna blow the whistle. So he gave me this golden opportunity to get even. (siren wails) - Thanks. Think I better have my gun back, Lieutenant. - Sure. (siren wails) - You don't think they're gonna believe that I set you up, do you? - I know what happened. That's two to one. - Parelli's paramour. No, the odds aren't good enough, baby. - He's right. The department would never believe us. What would Parelli believe? - What do you mean? - This gun killed two of his men. She'll take the stand, maybe put him out of business. How even are you gonna be with Parelli then? (chuckling) - You're gonna make a good lawman, Clint. - [Cop] Who's Lieutenant Thurston? - Right here. - Lieutenant, we got your call. There's a shooting in the marina? - That's right. Two of Danny Parelli's men tried to kill us. Thurston got them first. One's on the boat, the other's in the water. Thanks for saving our lives, Lieutenant. - [Cop] Need a lift to the station? - That's all right. I'll take Miss Warren back to the Riviera. - [Cop] If you can get in there. That place is a mess. In the middle of all the confusion, someone hit a keno ticket for 50 grand, playin' all sevens. (Bobbie gasps) - Look in my pocket. - Did you? You did! (laughing) (sweeping instrumental music) Come on, let's go get the money. (gentle instrumental music) - Lieutenant? You want us to get a warrant out for Parelli? - No. No, no, no. I'll pick him up myself. Would you believe it, Sergeant? I mean, for the first time in 25 years, I'm about to beat the house. (snaking instrumental music) (tinkling instrumental music)) (crashing)
