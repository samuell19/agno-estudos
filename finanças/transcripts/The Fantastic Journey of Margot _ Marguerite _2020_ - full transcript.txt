THE FANTASTIC JOURNEY PF MARGOT AND MARGUERITE Dad! Did you find him? Where is he? He has to be somewhere! Marguerite! The Lieutenant has been kind enough... Lost in combat doesn't mean... Maybe he's just a prisoner... But it's been weeks... Aunt Alice, say something. I wrote to my uncle again, he knows the General Mangin, he'll keep searching. Your letters won't help. We need to find him. That's enough! Will you join us for chicory? With pleasure, Madam. There... The Motte Beuvron's egg. My grandfather ate them like this and his grandfather too. They're from La Motte Beuvron so... Really? The same story every time you eat an egg? It wasn't funny the first time. Margot... You've got yolk there. Oh shit. I land around 4 pm. You're impossible. I'll call. Could you pick up my order? Hum... I'm quite busy actually, I have a... conference call with BETC for the animatic. They're pressuring me, crazy deadline... What is it? What's wrong? Nothing. C'mon, I like to laugh too. Spill it out. You talk as if you had a real job. I have a real job. Could we start the day nicely? Chilling in front of a computer is a real job? To be clear, I don't chill okay? Graphic designer! You can't even spell it! Obviously. Freelance! Milk is dripping. It's disgusting! Stop it! Both of you! You two, me in the middle, it's no longer possible. It needs to change. You're killing me. I got the brochure for the institute. That's never happening! You have 3 days to learn how to coexist peacefully with Laurent. Why is it always my fault? It's him! Be kind and clean up your mess! 3 days with the exorcist. That goes for you too! You'll send me off to boarding school? I didn't do anything! Exactly, so do something! Find the solution. Or else boarding school for her and back home for you. Have fun. I'm not spending 3 days with that jerk. He'll act like the boss. Seriously, how can she love this guy? Maybe he put a spell on her? I need to get out of here. Let's finish our book report first. "The Old Man and The Sea." Don't say you didn't read it? It's not even a 100 pages. I read it, quickly. What's the use? I'm not a fisherman, I don't live in Cuba so... Well then... Go to Australia. Join your father and his new girl. Super easy, not too far! Very funny. She's barely ten years older than me. I swear guys are such assholes. Thanks... You're not a guy. We're buddies, it doesn't count. - We're buddies, right? - Of course we are. There. We're buddies. Marguerite? There's so much dust here. "I wrote to the General Thing". That's all they can do, write... They're doing their best, you know. How is it, in Michel's chest? Michel? Uncle Michel. Mysterious Michel. He was quite successful with his tricks! Be careful with the chest. Why? It has magic. Uncle Michel said it grants your most secret wishes. One day he locked himself inside asking to disappear forever and we never saw him again. Never? Never. You're so gullible. He did disappear though, probably to avoid paying all his debts. C'mon, let's have some chicory. You'll wash your hands. A mouse isn't really clean. Dinnertime! Dinnertime! We do hear through the wall. I've been calling for 8 years. You never knock. I'm against violence. You never clean your room? Fine, I'll clean it. Let's eat? 'Cause it's hot and then it'll be cold. You see, that's the idea. I'll be right there. I'll walk, you teleport downstairs. Isn't it good? People say frozen pizza isn't good. Well no, it's really good. You like olives? No. I'm annoying you. What did I do? Anyways, that's not the topic. We have your mom in common. We don't want to hurt her. Okay? So for three days we will act like adults. Like Adults? You're an adult? One day you'll think I'm super cool. No one says "super cool" anymore. In my head I'm your age. Well, a little older so I can have a drink. No worries. Can I leave the table? You don't want dessert? I have a super dessert! You know, a custard mousse... Caramel custard. Okay go. Good night maybe? - You're the caramel custard! - What? Nothing. I said thank you, Laurent. It was really good. It has magic. The mysterious Michel. Your most secret dreams. We never saw him again. Never! No, I'm not mad. We had a great evening. Help me. Please. Pray for him. Please. That's enough now! It's not funny. Magic chest? No, it's Margot. Who are you? Marguerite. Where are you? Right here. What's going on? Down! We can't move an inch without those idiots jumping on us. Mom's right, we should... They obey me. That's all that matters. Marguerite! What is that outfit? Is it a cowboy costume? We should find you a hat. Am I in boarding school? Stop showing off. Wednesday, October 12, 1942 What's wrong with you? Down! You sit. No, you lay down. She sits. Marguerite? You okay? Margue...? I really need to go home. This child has become completely crazy. Calm down, my dear. Don't risk another heart attack. I didn't say attack! Will you two donkey buggers stop? Down! C'mon! Connect! Connect! C'mon! Connect! Margot! Breakfast! Margot! You need to hurry up! It's okay. It was the only dress. Okay! Annoying me beats your fear of being ridiculous. It's astonishing. Okay, have a seat. C'mon. Double chocolate or honeybees? Yes. Yes what? Yes, sir. Okay, so you'd rather keep on your act. Today is October 12th, 2019. The President's rating is at the lowest. In the United States... Please, I want to go home. I want to go home. Margot. Nathan's here. Oh yeah... Isn't that hatred? I'm not walking with you to school. Go get changed. Margot? Margot? Did you do the exercises? Oh my God, they won the war? Okay, not cool! We promised to take drugs together! Which gives us in the imperfect indicative form? Which gives us, Marguerite, "Amabam, Amabas, Amabat". Latin is important. Well... I know what we need. I hid it here. We left off right here... I need to wake up. Marguerite. Oh my God! Marguerite. I'm not Marguerite. My name is Margot. What the hell is happening? I see you don't believe me. I do... I do... You were in 2019 in a chest, you heard a voice and fell in a sort of... Wait! I know! Do you have this in 1942? It's just a phone. You're really from the future? Nope. I'm from the present. You're from the past. Really? It's not working. It's stupid. Why did Marguerite do this? Her father is all she has. I haven't seen mine for over 2 years. I don't abduct people in a magic chest. You don't have a dad? Worse. A sort of father-in-law. I'll end up in boarding school. - I loved boarding school. - Who cares? The question is how do I go home? The resemblance is striking! - You really look like... - Stop! We need to think! What if the chest sent you to grant Marguerite's wish? You find Louis. The prophecy's done, you go back to your time. This is nonsense! "I come from the future to rewrite the past" delusions. Nathan would have liked this. I know I get it. If you're from the future you know about the war? Oh no. It's not on our program. 1939-1945 is for next year. I don't know much about 1939-1945, just a few things. Hitler. Yes. Normandy Landings. Don't look now, we're being shot at . The General de Gaulle. I listen to him on the radio. What is 45? The end of the war! The war ended in 1945, May 8th. It's easy to remember, it's a holiday. We're looking for another 3 years? No. You might, but not me! I'm here because of Louis. Dead or alive, we'll find him. He better bring me home, okay? Can I talk to you? Father-in-law trouble? We're friends, right? You... You want to be more than friends? If I tell you a secret, promise not to tell? I might have the same secret. I don't think so. You're going to think I'm weird. What? So swag! It makes no sense. Why were you sent to our time? If he's dead, I should find out where and when. In the records? Back to the future to change history. Absolutely! Except, why would Margot go to the past? Maybe she has a mission too. Her book report? No. Let's start with a Google search. Wanna try? Hit the key and get the answer. - Yes. - Okay. So I'll do it. Here, look. I'm on the INA website, historical info and archives. - Your father's name? - Louis Cayrolles. Date of birth? August 26th, 1904. Anything else? He likes strong coffee and wears cologne. He has a mustache and he puts grease in his hair. I was thinking more about places he might have gone to? His last letters came from Hauze. Okay. They have a website, I'll access archives. And it obviously doesn't work. No choice. You need to go there. Would you come with me? - How many drops? - We can't do that! We need that car. How many drops? With three I sleep like a baby. One, two... Are you crazy? Grandpa, I apologize for my inappropriate behavior. I brought you a glass of Chateuse. Your favorite. A glass of what? Chateuse? Charmeuse. Your good old liqueur! What time is it? 10 am, 10:05. Do you believe it's time to enjoy a delicate and mouth-watering Chartreuse? No. I mean yes. It's always time for what we love. Here. That enough now, go away. Put it back where you found it. They were asleep, now they're awake! What are you doing? Marguerite, I forbid you! I have it! This place is a madhouse. C'mon, run! This was a very bad idea. - There's no key! - Yes. Under the seat. - Seriously? - Put that in front. Hop in, let's go! What do you mean, let's go? - You're letting me down? - No but... I said I'd help with the car. Just for the car. Who talked about the chest? I didn't force her to go inside! C'mon, Alice! - Alice, Marguerite! - You hate your brother? That's not the question. I just can't! Dad is going to beat me, for sure. - You wimp! - Oh, come on! What's gotten into you two? You better get out of here right now! For the General De Gaulle! What the hell are you two up to? For the General. Yes, let's go! If you don't open the door now, you'll have to face me! One by one! Women! They have weak nerves. Just put them under pressure. I'm counting to three. One. Hurry! What the... ? One. I said one! Two! Alice? Three! Oh my God! Go after them! Don't worry, she'll be back soon. With Louis. Miss Alice, stop! Go on! It's a cow! Where? It's one of the neighbors'. C'mon faster! We're going very fast? Yes but not too much. That train is. Who's the guy at Margot's place? Her mom's new boyfriend, Laurent. Her dad died long ago? No, divorced, like everyone else. Shouldn't we have bought tickets? No worries, no one controls anymore. Hello, ticket control please? Hello. I was thinking about the future, sorry, I mean your time. How is it? You have portable phones, right? What else? Nothing special. There's TV, Internet, school, parents, friends... The routine. What about the moon? Have you been on the moon? Yeah. Oh yeah! Like, lots of time! During the holidays and all. Yeah! It's not amazing. I expected better. That's too bad. Yes. Why do you live with your parents? A woman who lives alone without a husband could logically be considered as a... Independent and free to exist? Yes. Yes. Oh, sorry. It's okay. It's the oldest I have. So, you don't have tickets. You left in a hurry to join your dad who needs a kidney transplant. You're the only possible donors. Exactly. So, I can call your parents to check? They're in the hospital. There's no connection. Obviously. It's all my fault. I'm not Margot. I'm Marguerite. I'm from 1942. The magic chest sent me to find my father, Louis Cayrolles, who disappeared during the war. This young man only brings me to visit military cemeteries. Nice try with the kidney. - Yes. - I'll warn someone. They'll pick you up. Go to the waiting room. What are you doing? Let's go. We'll find another way. It's okay, my aunt taught me. My parents are going to kill me. It's the gas, right? Any gas station around here? - A what? - No? And relationships in the future? I mean between men and women. How is it? Seriously? You like him, he likes you and you say it. That's it! And then you get married? Exactly. You get married, you go to church by carriage pulled by six white horses. And then we release animals. Swans, doves, rabbits, kangaroos... You make 7 dwarves and live happily ever after. Stop whining. There are no kangaroos. I knew that. Swans and carriages, obviously, but this... I'm not as naive as you think. What are you doing? I'm fed up! Wait up! We'll have to bring back the bikes. Yes, yes, don't worry. - What do we do now? - We search. You see how many there are? Margot? Marguerite? You resurrecting an army of zombies? I like zombies. Excuse me. The nearest coffee shop please? - This way, Miss. - Thank you. - Goodbye. - Bye! Hello. Hello. Do you know Louis Cayrolles? A pilot? All the people are over there. Excuse me, are you serving food? A La Motte Beuvron egg? How do you know that? - Laurent? - Nope. I'm Marcel. Who's that beauty? Your sister? No, my aunt, Alice. She's single! - She's not very sharp. - That's okay, on the contrary. Have a seat! C'mon, ladies! Oh yes. Hello. Hello. Have a seat. - Thank you. - So... We're looking for my father. Louis Cayrolles. His last letters came from here. It was about 6 months ago. Cayrolles, no, it doesn't ring a bell. He's an American. That's why, he writes. A journalist or something. He talks and sometimes he doesn't. He's not talking right now. The Krauts! I'll get them! I'll get them this time! I'll get them this time! Unbelievable. I'd rather avoid trouble. Madeleine! Hello, sir. We're looking for Louis Cayrolles. Maybe... I don't know, six months ago? The Old Man? The Sea? You wrote The Old Man And The Sea ? That's awesome for my book report. Don't move. Explain everything to me. What's going on? Who is this man? Hemingway. Don't know. Didn't you write the book? You're going to write it. Help me. I don't know anymore. Stuck! I have no idea. I suck. Well... Imagine... The boat's too small for swordfish. So the sharks take the opportunity to eat the fish left in the water. The old man gets to the port and finds bones. "Symbolic". Enough! Tell us what you know or this is over! That's it! Nothing. The end. She's right. Well, yes! Cayrolles... On a mission. On the other side of the border. In German territory. Maybe he's stuck over there? Could we ask the Resistance to help? The Resistance? Marcel! Come over here! Don't yell that out, I'll be spotted. Now listen, Marcel. You need to help these ladies. They have to pass through the forbidden zone. Yeah, I can help you pass. But it's dangerous. What's that? Meat. Really? I knew you'd like it! - Sorry! - Don't worry. How are you kids? Am I interrupting? May I join you? I just talked to your mom. Seeing she can't come, because she has a real job, whereas I'm obviously adapting. So you like military cemeteries? That's great! I've been all around for over 3 hours. Then I thought, it's time for the big beasts to drink. Here I am. Right Margot? - Not Margot. - Work it out with your folks, okay. I swear! Margot left to find her dad! To find her father? That's great! Fantastic, go. Got for it girl! It'll give me a break. And the surfer dad comes off well. You think I enjoy putting up with your moods? You think I'm happy living with a kid who judges 24 hours a day? Hey! Where are you going? To the toilets, I'm gonna puke. I'm sorry. I don't want to make trouble. I miss him. He left so fast. But he swore to come back. I'm sure it's not his fault. I'm sorry... I got a bit... But admit you're a pain. Did you talk to your mom? Every night but she doesn't answer. I'm sure that's... It's because... Grown-ups are complicated. Even I struggle. Your mom first tried fast food with me. Isn't that funny? It was our first weekend together. Just the two of us and I helped empty the house. It was for a great aunt. It was just to help, I do other things. I do romantic things, like candlelight. I'm pretty good. Even if I know you think I'm a big loser. You're not an easy person. You know I should be working not running behind you like an idiot? At least the cool part is that we can share and talk together. Where are you going? To puke too. That's it. The problem about... You must savor this kind of stuff. They don't know. Margot! What the... Annoying kids! You're a pain! Unbelievable. Margot? What's wrong with you! I almost killed you. Nothing broken? He's not well. Go get help! Don't move. I'll go! You know how to drive? Yeah, I'm pretty good at Mario Kart. Oh no! Hey my love? You okay? Everything's good. She's doing well. We're together. We're at the carnival. Uh, no. I can't put her on 'cause she's at the bumper cars. Hurry, he saw us, step on it! Hey! Watch out! - I'm sorry! - He didn't park well. Margot! Stop! Fuck! We'll use the same method as last time. Stay behind the farm and kept them in sight. We're crazy to be here. You're right. He's my brother, I'll go. I'm stuck at my dad's waiting for Prince Charming. Suck it up. At 40 your life is ahead of you. I'm 28! It's amazing what you've done. I'll find Louis, you'll go home. No, I'm coming with you. Anyways, you're my only chance. Come on. Put this on. Only the sheep can go to the other side. To feed the soldiers. I admire you. That's a brave thing to do. - You know, it's just... - I meant the sheep. I'm kidding! That's funny. Come on guys! Let's go! Stop! Soldier Schneider! Inspect the herd. Execute! All clear, sir. Come on, let's keep moving! Run! Margot! I can't believe this! So, running away, public transport fraud, bicycle theft, car theft and an accident. My parents will kill me. I don't care! I'll plead insanity. Thank you for everything. That's what friends are for, right? Don't you have friends in your time? Well... Girls and boys are... a bit complicated. It's cool here. You don't have to get married. Girls kiss boys. And boys kiss the girls. Even girls-girls or boys-boys. - Have you? - No! I'm just saying... Whatever works for each of us. I'm more of a girl... I mean I kiss... Well, when I kiss... If I kissed someone it would be... Forget about it. What's that in your mouth? Braces. It's for proper teeth alignment. You think I could get some? You don't need them, I mean, your teeth look great. - We need to go to sleep. - Yes. We need to be in shape tomorrow. - Good night. - Good night. We're better inside. I can't believe this! Margot! Where are you? Hey guys! Anyone here? I'm not mad. I'm just fed up! Fed up! Fuck! Shit! Shit! Alice? What the... How did you find me? I'm so happy! So very happy! You always manage to get naked. Well, yes. I forget my skirt in the trees. It's a disaster. We'll avoid the roads and cut through the fields and the forest. Grimm Bruder must be about 10 kilometers away. Do you have a plan B? What plan B? Zombies! I knew it! Get out! I hate you! C'mon! C'mon faster! Faster! Go! Keep going! Don't stop! C'mon! Drive! They're not going to leave. Stop! Stop! You okay? Get out. Get in the back, please. I don't want to hear a word. Don't even move. Nothing. - Can we go... - Shut up! Shut up! Fucking shut up! Is that clear? Now I'm talking like my dad because of you! You're annoying. New recruits. Welcome to Niemeyer! Follow the orders and you'll be fine. If you escape... Good. Nothing better than a little work to stretch out your arms and legs. Yeah? C'mon! What? It's my home! It's my village. I said not a word! Remember? Not a word. Unbelievable! I'm tired! What the hell are you doing? Excuse me, Madam. You're from the Cayrolles family? No, why? Because they used to live here. We bought it from Mrs. Connor. Sarah Connor? - Hello. - Hi. Excuse me. The mud that... Long story. How do you know this house? This is the house we emptied with your mom. We moved it all out. I told you about the old lady. How do you know this place? We'll never find him. At best we're out in three years. We will! The magic already exists. You of all people should know. Louis! What are you doing here? We came to get you! - How did you do it? - Long story! This is one of the biggest jails of the forbidden zone. Everything on two legs is requisitioned. We work for the Germans. I crossed the border and got caught. They brought me here. You didn't try to escape? All those who tried got caught. And were shot. - There's got to be a way. - Yes. Tolerate. And wait till this madness ends. That's your plan? Carrying wood? No, just staying alive. That's not enough. We need to go home. So move your ass. Marguerite! Watch your mouth. I'm your father. "I'm your father"? I don't need someone who hides. It would be nice to have a father who takes risks for me. Someone to trust. Someone who protects and loves me even when I'm a pain or joking. You are each as bad as the other. Shit! I'm sorry. I promised you I'd come back. If I had to stay 10 years farming potatoes for Germans, I'd do it. For you. There's one thing you can be sure of, I love you. So you're right, I'm not a heroic father but I'm an alive one. There's not a lot of heroes around here. We all do our best. There has to be a solution. We run, we steal a truck, I don't know... Don't even think of it. You see your grandpa and his car? It's nothing compared to them. Get ready. We're leaving tomorrow. Dad loved this garden. He learnt all the flower names. I realize I wasn't listening. You came for the holidays? I mean you came with him here? No worries, we'll keep searching. No, we're not searching anything. It was useless anyway. Okay stop... crying because it makes me sad. I don't get it. You're not yourself. You never talk about your dad and now. Last time we asked you to go you blew us off. I need to see Mrs. Connor. Maybe she knows. Please, Laurent. Damn it! So, we'll see the lady tomorrow if there's no more car chasing. Deal? Deal. I need to see something outside. Yeah but... I'm completely lost. You understand something? She needs us, that's all. That must be it. To our soldiers who died for France War 1939-1945 Can you peel potatoes? Yes. Yes, Madam. Come on. Is that the officer's meal? Potatoes. I'll get some wood. What are you doing? There was a burning smell. So I stirred. Get away! Run! What was in your thing? Opium and heroin, I think. The doctor gave it to me. So you're a huge junkie. Yes. Let's find Louis, c'mon! - Remember all we said? - Don't worry. Ready? Take off! I don't have enough speed. C'mon! Hurry up! I got them! I told you I would. Hang on. Madam, they've arrived. Hello, Madam. My name is Marguerite Cayrolles. I'm from Montracher. I used to live here with my family. Ever heard of the Cayrolles? Louis Cayrolles? Did you know him? Marguerite! Yes. It's me. Aunt Alice! I can't believe this. Louis, the war, the chest. It was so long ago. Sometimes it's like I dreamt it. My God, you're alive. And Dad? Dad too? No, my dear, he died years ago. But he had a nice life. You two shared good times. Margot found him. I helped a little. If dad's not here, how will I go home? If I understand, you need to find a dad for Margot. I didn't find anything. I don't even know where he is. Margot's dad is in Australia. Everything okay? Hello, Madam. Well... We're going to head back, okay? I hate it when you cry, so, c'mon. Let's go home. He's the father. Oh no! I'm the father-in-law, not even, I'm the boyfriend of her mother. If she doesn't send me away. I'm going home! I'm going home! Yes, that's the plan! Bye Aunt Alice. Bye Marguerite. I don't get it. Marcel! I couldn't have known. From down here a Kraut plane looks like a Kraut plane. Marcel, you've apologized ten times. When will you get that I don't blame you? Alice? Get used to it. Your Alice has changed. Wait until you see Marguerite. I bet you'll be surprised. Oh no! Damn it! She's already back! Nothing happened. I mean... Everything went well. Okay? My love! It's us. We're home. We were at the supermarket and you're going to laugh, we didn't buy anything! So, you achieved your mission? Yes, I think. Thanks to you. Be careful when you get back. You could disturb the entire space-time continuum. With your knowledge of the future. What? I have to go. Hey there! I have a surprise! We received your dresser! No more excuses to not tidy up! What's with her? I thought she would like it. What did you do, Love? Okay, c'mon! Magic chest, please! It's done. Marguerite's father went home. Magic chest? Can I go home? Faster! I can hear her calling me. Your dad's back. Yours too. Wait, I'm coming! - Did you give her drugs? - Obviously. We drank in bars, smoked all night. We even tagged the neighbor's door. You really think I'm irresponsible. As if I was immature. You need to stop throwing out things you don't like through the window. You heard me right! What do we do now? Well, we... We'll do a magic trick. Exactly. Thank you. You okay? Did you have a hard time? No, it was great. - Ready? - Ready. Dad? Hi. Is dad here? No, why would he? Amazing trick. Well done. Can't you see she changed clothes? New hairstyle. The chest was empty. Oh yes! Yes, I checked. Well done! I don't get it and I don't want to know. Really nice. So, I suggest we keep the chest in the garage for magic tricks. For your stuff you'll use the dresser Isabelle bought for you. That way, everyone's happy. You seem to be really getting along! Your daughter's great. What are you doing here? Margot? Who else would it be, dimwit? Margot. Did she do anything I can regret? She's super cool. You would have liked her. Are you in love? Nope. Just buddies. I met Hemingway. You met Hemingway? Honestly the guy was having trouble. He wanted to call his book "The old man, the fish, life, death, the sea". Like, I don't know. I told him about the fish who was eaten by the sharks. Whatever! I don't believe you at all. Nope! "I miss you a lot. "The house too "but leaving is the best choice I've taken in a long time. "New York, what a city! "Everything's huge, modern, so different. "I bought a camera. I'll send pictures "before leaving for Hollywood!" What will people say? Alice is an independent woman who's free to live her life. Right?
