Sublime. Look at that perfection, perfect strokes, perfect movements, perfect curves. Magnificent. See, the artist invites us to feed the eye, just as a physical organ. and, finally, to abandon our gaze, like we give up weapons. And that gives you a sense of calm. Because the eye is greedy, and needs to feed its appetite, understand? No, I'm unable to understand. You know... I'm an idiot. You always have to explain it to me many times. - You're not an idiot. - Yes. Why you always have to explain everything to me? A waste of time. I don't think it's a waste of time. If you don't wanna talk... You don't talk, you give lectures. We're past the school age, I'm not your student. You're not a teacher, and I'm not your student. - Who are you then? - Who am I? The one who says: Go fuck yourself! Get it? Go fuck yourself, asshole! OK? Bye, great scholar! Bye, great intellectual! Scholar, my ass! Bye! Either you're my accomplice or my enemy. Could you take my picture with Daddy, please? We're responsible for what we see. Antoine... Antoine. Yes. Yes! Marc, it's you! Who's Antoine? I don't know, why? You said Antoine. - I said that? - Yes, you said... Kiss me. I smoked last night. How did it go last night? Last night? Didn't you go out? Yes, yes. Was it good? Actually, I don't remember. I got a little stoned. Started smoking again, stupid me. Guess what? Thomas called me. - He did? - Yes, last night. And? You two still don't talk? Why you're asking? You know very well. We haven't spoken for 2 years, and it's fine by me. He made like it was normal. Real casual. Just to "re-connect". Just to get in my pants! Did he mention me? Not a word. He was beating around the bush. "How's it going, kitten?" I said Kitten's 5-month pregnant. That cooled him off. This restaurant's got history. It's an old hangout for thieves. By "old" I mean it's been for a long time. I can read your eyes. What do they say? You want to see... Ali Baba's cave. Excuse me. As always, the innocent are sacrificed. Innocence makes me sick. The paintings stay here a few nights. Then they're gone for good. Safer that way. The buyers never show them. This is the last place to see them. The last exhibition. All you see will stay here only for a few hours... or else they're no good. It's the most ephemeral show in the world. In the world, no less? That's good enough. There's... a strange smell. Not unplaisant. It's Penhaligon's, a cologne. English, of course. - What's up? You're all perspired. - I was afraid to be late. I can feel your heartbeat. Your pulse is crazy! You're wearing gloves now? I read there's a scabies epidemic. You catch it on your fingers. - I don't have scabies. - Maybe I do. - You look dopey in your hat. - Lice! - Did you call Corinne secretly? - Are you sick? - Answer me. - Why'd I call that slut? - You didn't always say that. - All right. So what? - She's pregnant. - Not by me! If I fucked her, I'd remember. Heard that? No, what? There it is again. Hear? I hear nothing. Yes! It comes from there. Like someone's laughing. Giggling. Someone's giggling. Holy shit! What? I'm dreaming! - What is it? - Wow! It's an orgy. A Venetian orgy. I swear! Listen. Marcello! Marcello! You hear that? You're teasing me. Step down. Let me see. No way. It's not for you, baby. Holy cow! Like in Byzantine times! A cartoon. What did you say? Your face looked like a cartoon. Frowning, knitting your eyebrows, smiling... What'd you dream about? I don't remember. Of Byzantines, I think. Who's that? Want me to get it? It's the police. What? I swear. Who is it? The police. They wanna talk to you. Come off it. If you don't believe me... Ms. Anna Oz? That's me. Why didn't you call? Why? You were scared? Someone threatened you? Sorry, I don't understand. Really. Someone threatened you? No, no one. Then why didn't you call? Why would I call you? Like that, for no reason? What's this about? - Were you there? - Where? - Yes or no? - No. I don't think so. Then please don't interject, please. You can be with her here, but if you make trouble, you're out. I don't think I was there either. You were seen leaving the hotel. What hotel? You're asking me? All right. Feel like joking about this? That's nasty. Now you remember? No, not at all. You were seen leaving the hotel 2 nights ago. It's absurd. I saw nothing. I wasn't there. Sorry, but until proven otherwise, you're a material witness. What is it? - I had a nightmare. - Oh, dammit! I've been dreaming about a Venetian orgy. I was about to screw a girl dressed as a nurse. I was at a police station. They accused me of something, showed me nasty pictures. Something you ate. This place is great. Sure it is. I'd like to stay here forever. Their white blouses, their scent of ether, angels... Erotic angels. That's it. Forever? What? You'd like to stay here forever. That's what you said in your sleep. I didn't mean here. I should hope not. How long will they hold me here? That I don't know. Careful! It burns. You always walk on tip-toe? I didn't wanna scare you. You were absorbed. Liquid nitrogen. To preserve delicate merchandise. It burns the skin. I know. No doubt. But you wanted to know what's inside. No. Well, yes. I don't know. "No, yes, I don't know"... Don't know what you wanna know? Do you like it here with your boyfriend? It's classy. You share a bed, right? It's nothing compared to what you do. What do I do? You know exactly what I mean. We heard you last night... All this disgusting giggling. And he even saw you. Spying on me? So you're comfortable here? Oh yes. I really like the bathroom. The tub is enormous. Careful, you might drown. It's a family-size tub. How's your thesis going? I'm still taking notes. Notes? "Innocence is her main activity." "No one notices her snake-like smile." "She thinks she dreams of me." "She doesn't realize yet," "that she's the one who's just a dream." Is this about Venice? It's a character study. You know this person? None of your business. Anyway, if she exists, I'd love to meet this creature. She doesn't exist. It's a dream. I note my dreams. - That's my ring! - I found it! - Let me go, it hurts! - Little snoop! Your main activity isn't innocence! Let me go! Take your ring! It clogged the drain. We get along pretty well, huh? So tell me what you saw late Monday night. It wasn't me. We spent here all night. For nothing. Let us go, or we'll call a lawyer. We have the right, you know! You can go. But listen: if you don't talk you won't be safe. What a nightmare! Glad it wasn't me. I can't stand cops. Ever had a dream with sequels? I never dream. Oh right! I had a dream my baby was born with clothes on. I've been having weird dreams lately. They all take place in Venice. And they go in sequence. Like a long story. The beginning of the end. Pardon? You should never dream in sequence. Too dangerous. Why? You let your guard down in dreams. Imagine, how powerful they'd become if they get organized. Give them an inch, they'll take a mile. They spread over your existence like leprosy. You sound like Nosferatu. Don't leave any room for doubt. Can you prove you aren't dreaming right now? Maybe we're all part of a dream. We don't exist. You only find out when you wake up. Until you wake up, you don't really know. I see you exist. What is it? What's going on? I'm OK. Excuse me, I need some air. You're staying? Can't you tell? - Go after her. - I don't think so. She's changed lately. Really? For how long? - Since she's been with me? - I didn't say that. But you thought about it. We've known her for 5 years. We can think what we like. Bye! Is this the hotel they mentioned? Why did you leave? I don't know. Maybe it was the music or because I'm tired. Something made you sad? I'd like to be alone. You want to sleep? Sleep and dream? "Sometimes in summer, if she's left to rest... by wicked suns, weary, over my thoughts... Gently I'll sleep in shadow of her breast... with only such dream as her dream has brought." Beautiful. With a capital B, as in Baudelaire. This is what happiness is. So much of it can make you sick. A moment like this should last forever. Right. It should never end. Got a light, lovebirds? I don't smoke. Too bad. This guy's mug could make a rat vomit. He looked at me like he knew me. Let's go back. Yeah, let's go back. Let's infect his existence like leprosy. Leprosy? Hello? Hello, Marc. It's me. What's up? You fell out of bed? - Did I wake you? - No. I was writing to my landlord. I was sad that you didn't stay last night. Last night? You mean the other night? It was last night! No, it was the night before. You even recited Baudelaire's poem to me. - Remember? It was last night! - Of course, it was. So why do you tease me? I just wanted to make sure you were awake. Sometimes you're really dumb! That'll teach you to take dreams over reality. What did he say? He wants to protect you. - From what? - I don't know. From yourself, he said. He really likes you, that's for sure. What else did he say? He doesn't give a fuck what we think of him. What does he live on? He writes science articles for magazines. I even read one on the chaos theory. A story of a butterfly that sets off a cyclone. Pinch me. - Are you nuts? - Pinch me now! - Where? - Anywhere. Harder. Anna! Anna! You OK? Anna, listen! Anna, you hear me? Anna! What took you so long? I don't have the key! I've been yelling for 15 minutes from a gondola. And then I risked my neck climbing the wall. Are you going in this? - Can't I go like that? - Really? Hurry up, we're gonna be late. Hey! Let's go! What are you doing? Stop! Leave it. Let's go. - Good evening. - Good evening. Now really! It could happen to anyone. Forget about it. What could happen? Fainting from an emotional shock. A classic case. Some people faint when they win a lottery. I'm not anyone. That picture didn't drop out of your dreams by magic. Venice. It might've been taken on a boat in Paris. The guy in your dream was blind. Here I only see a guy in sunglasses. The girl made a face... It's just a coincidence. You see. It's no big deal. Put yourself in my shoes... - Everybody dreams. - But not like me. I dream too. Even when I'm awake. I can look at your hand... and let my mind wander... You're my strangest happiness. You're coming? Look at that. I love it. The switch's out again. I'll turn it on upstairs. Marc! Get out of here! Bitch! You know what happens to snoopers? Come on. Stick the cotton in further. Go ahead. Further. Push the cotton in further. When you sneaked into the hotel, what did you feel? Think. Imagine the scene again. Concentrate. I had a strange feeling. Like I'd been there before. In Venice. Have you been to Venice? No. She often dreams of it. You mean you've seen this hotel in a dream? I think so. In Venice. Who doesn't dream of Venice? Enough for now. - You believe in premonition? - No. Me neither. - She'd been to this hotel before. - She says no. My instict says: yes. If I could get inside her dreams... I guess there's no way around it. She has to go to a psychiatrist. - But why? - To help my case. Here. Tell him I sent you. - What were you two scheming? - Nothing. - You think I'm crazy? - You're crazy... to think that. You should see yourself. Bitch! You wanted him to kill me? Is that it? Let me live in peace, you bitch! Big pain in the ass! You're going anyway. Why the fuck should I go to Paris? Don't be rude! What do I do there? You kill. Come again? You're going to Paris to kill. Kill what? Kill time? You're gonna kill the girl who lives in my apartment. Me? You. But I never killed anyone... I don't know how. I wasn't even in the army. I'm a conscientious objector! Conscientious, my ass! Why don't you kill her yourself? You'll understand when you see the girl. What is it? Take it. Just give her this letter. See? it's not complicated. No bloodshed. I'm happy we're alone here again. You don't like Thomas? His manners don't agree with me. And mine? When I saw you, arriving in Venice... it was like getting news about myself. Do you love me a little? I don't know. You have something which was mine a long time ago... that you keep well-guarded, I know... in a little box... with a blue cotton inside. Hello. Hello. I just wanted to know if everything's all right. Yes, everything's all right. Come in. So you're satisfied? Yes. Epiphanie's satisfied. Ah, Epiphanie... The rent is fair? I don't handle it. - Don't you pay it? - No, I don't. I help with the ironing and some cleaning. So you don't live here? No, I live downstairs. Very convenient. Yes, convenient. And the actual tenant? She's in her bedroom. Obviously, planes are faster than trains. You've come here to tell me that? Yes, among other things. So you just do what she says? What's the game you two playing? Like her clown... - I pity you. - Fuck your pity, and you too! - Still so refined! - Right. You should get laid sometimes, It'll clear up your head! Do you know why she sent you here, idiot? Are you gonna throw a fit? It's coming? Go on, do it! What are you afraid of? Of being like Mom? You're her spitting image, Anna. You didn't know? Even the same smell. You stink of Mom. You asked for it! When you read this letter, you'll feel sick. And for a reason. I'm glad I'm not you. You let me exist, out of kindness... Like a cancer eating at you... In your dreams, I'm doing great. Poor kitten... You're the one who has to disappear. That'll teach you to take dreams over reality. I don't need you to exist. Get that into your fly-sized brain. Believe me, you should end it all. How? You know the law of gravity? Ah, she's taking her bath! - Get out now! - Now? Get out? To go back to Paris, or Brussels, or Roubaix? - Stop yelling! You're not at home. - I'm yelling? Why don't you get out and explain! Marcello! She bites! Bitch! You little French hoodlum! Yikes! Did you catch cold? Yes. I'm still in this nightmare. What nightmare? You realize, who's got his paws on us? No, what paws? He's a monster, a vile bastard. You called me, Anna? No. Who are talking to? To my brother. I'd like to be alone with him. Naturally. He deals in human organs. The eyes. You get it? We have to tell the police. I can't turn in my father. Right. Why did you send me to Paris? Why you were there too? What's the deal? It wasn't me. Not really. It wasn't you? Not really? It was the other one. Who? She's there now. Who, dammit? Anna. The one who hates you, who's refused to see for 2 years. Who wants to get rid of me and you too. Me too? Of course. Like a dream. Like a soap bubble. Pop! You get it now? Sure. You sent me to Paris to kill the girl who wasn't you. Real simple. It's her who's scheming in her nutty head. We live in her dreams! Are you sure? You want proof? Yeah, sure. Call my number in Paris. Look at this little girl. Her mother found her 2 days ago... wearing a blindfold, and 500 pesos stuck in her pocket. Her eyes were gone, gouged out to be sold by organ traffickers. "Hello, it's Anna Oz, I'm not in right now..." "Please leave your message after the beep. Thanks." You're here? Yeah, it's me. I dreamed you were watching something horrible. Children... What children? On TV, in the next room. I don't know... And then the answering machine... The phone rang. It didn't ring. Relax, Anna. Give me your hand. You feel very light. The gravity is disappearing... disappearing... The sky is blue, very blue. You're floating in the blue sky. You feel a warmth penetrating you. It's penetrating you... penetrating you... Blue, blue... A blue warmth. Sky blue. High up in the sky. The enormous blue. Never? You've never been to Venice? Never. So why are you here in my office? Can you explain? I'm dreaming I'm here. But I'm not a dream. Madam, it's your problem. So you're living out a dream? And the one dreaming you is in Paris, is that it? Yes. During the day, when you're awake in Paris, I mean... what do you do? Today, for instance... Right now, I'm asleep. But if you wanna help me to know more... call Dr. Victor Kahn, that's his number right here. Call him. I'm in his office now. They want to get to the bottom of this case. You mean he's treating you now? Yes, now. Blue. All is blue. Blue. Plum pie. All is blue. What is it? I'm in a session! An urgent call from Venice. Hello! Dr. Victor Kahn? Yes. What is it? I'm Dr. Marina Marini from Venice. I have a patient here who claims to be in your office now. Say it again. Anna Oz, a young French woman, brunette... She's in my Venice office. She asked me to call you to help calm her anxiety. Mrs. Marini? Yes. Anna Oz is in my office now, if you enjoy phone pranks like this you need to come here for treatment. Answer me, Anna. Where are you, Anna? In Venice. No, you're not in Venice. You're in Paris... outside of a run-down hotel, on a narrow street. You're going home after a party. No, no! No. Come on! Answer me. Answer me. - You don't answer. - It wasn't me, it was the Blondie! You'll pay for this! No! Not my eye! Not my eye! It wasn't me. No! No! It wasn't me! Anna! I'm gonna count to three. I'm gonna count to three. And you'll wake up. One, two, three. Is it over? I think that's enough for today. You hear me or not? You hear me or not? What? I've been asking you for half an hour... Half an hour? Yes, and you looked at me like I'm transparent. I was pensive. I noticed. Are you still under hypnosis? Didn't he wake you up? He did. What were you saying? Nothing important. You were reciting another poem? What's the sarcasm for? It's not sarcasm. Really? "Another poem"... - Calm down. - I'm calm. You're irritated. I can tell. I'm noticing something. Why you're so obnoxious? What do you mean? Why you do this to me? Stop. Calm down. I'll call you. I'm an idiot. No. You're drunk? Just a little tipsy. I'm sorry. You're too nice to me. I wonder why you aren't with another girl. Not a chance. If I saw you again for the 1st time it would be the same. Really? The same what? I'd fall in love immediately. - Like that? For no reason? - None. Just because you're you, and I'm me. Reliving your memories? My mother. My father, when he still lived with us. He left when I was 5. Thomas, my brother, whom I never see. My father and mother. Me, older. I was 8. My father again. My mother hated me for keeping his name: Oz. She hated me anyway. For what? For being born, I guess. My family wasn't much of a family. Look. What? Obviously, you can't tell. My father. Him. He had... What? It was disgusting and fascinating... I saw him removing it... and cleaning it, as Mom looked on lovingly. He had... or rather he didn't have... What didn't he have? What is it? Open it and look. It's you who's gonna die, bitch! Shit! Oops! You did it on purpose! Stop it! So how have you been? This and that. I learned a lot of things. Watch. You shocked me last time on the phone, when you said you were pregnant. It's OK, I'll recognize the kid. We did it twice since we broke up. One more to go. Does it have to be 3 times? 3 times after a break-up, it's the best. - Pregnant women turn me on. - Stop it! But not him. See that look? He looks at you. He'd like to punch you. The father of his child? You made up with Anna? I love my sister. We just can't stand each other. Dessert. - What is it? - Plum pie. Everybody wants some? Yeah. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6... 8 slices, that'd be easier. You made it yourself? On your own? With your little hands? Looks good. Yeah, this smells very good. A slice without pits for me. There are no pits in there. - It's not a good plate for it. - It's OK. - It's gonna slide into my plate. - I want the 1st slice. Next one for me. Some more for me. What she's saying? Nothing. Pass me a plate. You don't want it? Go ahead. Wait! Wait! No! Hello. Hello. Any chance she'll make it? Operated 3 days ago. Anything is possible. Good or bad. Four flights is quite a fall. We help the nature do its work. Does thought still exist in this kind of state? It remains a mystery to us. Cerebral activity is not zero. But whether thought, as we know it, exists... no one really knows. Anna, my love. Come back. Please, don't leave me. - Excuse me. - It's OK. - Sorry. - Forget it. Can I help you? No. Remember that painting, when I bumped into you? Very well. I think it's a forgery, and you? - Why do you say that? - Just a hunch. I love that painting. Staying in Venice for long? I'm leaving for Florence tonight. I arrived from Florence this morning. Goodbye then. Goodbye. You know, in Florence... there's a strange malady. Really? That's right. Many tourists consulted psychiatrists... complaining of inexplicable sadness. There's an American study on the subject. These tourists were so overwhelmed by the city's beauty, they became sort of addicted. I felt it myself a little. I think you shouldn't go there alone. I know all about that malady of Florence. Really? Yes, but it doesn't affect me. I've lived in Florence for 3 years. I have a husband there. I see. Well... Have a nice trip back. Thanks. - Bye. - Bye. I've never been there. I was kidding. I live here with my father. Attention!
