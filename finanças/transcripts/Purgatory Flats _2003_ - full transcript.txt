[wind whistling] [piano music] [inaudible dialogue] Oh. Oh, yes. Yeah? I shouldn't have had that last bottle of Merlot. [laughing] And don't think I didn't notice you flirting with Angela. MAN: I was not flirting with her. I was not flirting with her. It's OK. I think it's cute. You're so goddamn beautiful. [gasps] [tires screech] MAN: Are you OK? Natalie? Natalie? [grunts] Natalie? Natalie? [sharp breaths] JUDGE: Dr. Reed, found guilty for driving under the influence, reckless endangerment, and involuntary manslaughter. I've taken into consideration that this is a first-time offense, and I'm going to accept the recommendation of the State and sentence you to serve a term of five years with credit for time served. I hereby release you to the custody of the Department of Corrections to designate what you will serve for the remainder of your sentence. [slow piano music] [gate buzzes] [gate buzzes] MAN: Listen, I gotta go. Call me later. Bye. Hey, how's it going? What are you doing here? Nice to see you too. Didn't I tell you I didn't want anybody coming? Yeah, you did, but I figured I could give you a ride back to LA. I'm not going back to LA. Wait a second. Why? I'm not ready. Look, I talked to my boss about getting you on as a lab tech or an orderly until you get your license back. I know it's not glamorous, but you can pull in some decent cash, and he's willing to overlooked the conviction. Thank you, but no thanks. All right. Then tell me, what are you gonna do? I don't know. Nothing to do with medicine. Tommy, look, don't do this, all right? I know you're hurting. Try and focus on all the people you have helped, all right? Look, you made a mistake and you served your time. How long are you gonna punish yourself for? I guess until I do something worse. [truck horn beeping] [music playing] Hey. Where are you headed? Purgatory. What? Purgatory Flats, about 20 miles down the road. Do you want the ride or not? [music playing] [brakes squeaking] THOMAS: Thanks a lot. [rap music] [slow piano music] [country music] I got them all just a laughing down here tonight. I've been begging for the human-- What could I get you? Uh-- I would like the tallest, coldest beer you have. Ah. [chuckles] Been a while, huh? Ah. Yeah, it has. Um-- can I get another one? Hey, um-- do you know where a guy could get some work around here? [upbeat music] [country music] It sure is pissing down out there, huh? Hey, new guy. Give me another. Uh-- didn't you drive here tonight? - So what? - OK. Could I can get your keys, please? What is this? OK, well, uh, you're not getting another drink until you give me your keys, so. Hey, what kind of bullshit is that? Now, what the hell is going on here? Oh, this dipshit is cutting me off. Oh. I think he's had enough. This is a bar. You're a bartender. Now, your job is to give him whatever he orders. Got that? Hm? Do you know what a human liver looks like when it's been subjected to years of alcohol abuse? Oh, leave me alone. Well, I do. Actually, it's, uh-- it's black and it's scarred. Oh, shut up. You know, it kind of looks like an old sponge that's been soaked in motor oil. Yeah, the fluids build up in your abdomen. Shut up. The stomach bleeds profusely. I said shut up. OK. Uh-- God. Why don't you watch where you're going? Oh, fuck off, you smelly drunk. [sighs] Is something wrong? No, no, no. It's just, um, you remind me of someone. Oh, yeah. Right. Whatever excuse you need. No. No. No, see I-- I wasn't trying to-- Hm. I'm sorry. Hey, hey. [chuckles] Are you gonna make me a drink, or do I have to climb over the bar and do it myself? OK. Uh, what do you want? Do you know how to make a slow, comfortable screw? Well, um-- it has been a while, but I guess some things you never forget. So, uh-- You're always saying, anytime I need something, you're gonna be there. You're-- you're gonna help me out. Do I look stupid? Hm? Do I? No, no, no. I know what you're gonna use it for. How'd I do? I've had better. Ouch. You are wicked. You have no idea. I'm Thomas, by the way. Sunny. Perfect. SUNNY: [chuckles] Perfect. So, uh, what's your story, Thomas? Oh, well, you know, not really much to tell. Just sort of moved into town. [laughs] That's fucked up. Most people I know are trying to get out of this place. Well, I guess I'm not like most people you know. Things are gonna change, soon. And you're gonna be the one coming to me for cash. The answer's no, Owen. Get over it. Fuck you, you fucking loser. Yo, Sunny, let's go. I haven't finished my drink yet. I don't care. We've got an appointment, bitch [sighs] Well, I still gotta pay. Now hurry the fuck up. Hey, let go of me. What the fuck are you looking at, you punk-ass bitch? OK, so what's the story with Vanilla Ice? He's her husband. Why is it the better they look, the worse their taste in men? I mean, come on, the guy's a dickhead, right? That's my nephew. Oh. Sorry. Fuck. He ain't coming. It's not even time yet. He didn't give you any money? Hell, no. A fucking load of bullshit, that's all he gave me. Well then what are we doing here, Owen? Don't fucking worry about it, all right? I'm taking care of this shit. You just keep your fucking mouth shut. I get the impression you haven't been a bartender long. Oh. Yeah, well I did, I did, in college. But, God, I swear the tips were bigger and the kegs were lighter, man. [laughs] Amen to that. I'm Dean, Dean Mecklin. Hey. Thomas Reed. DEAN: Nice to meet you, Thomas. Nice to meet you. A college boy, huh? How'd you end up here? Uh, I don't know. You know, I guess I just always had this romantic idea about small towns. [laughs] Yeah, yeah, right, this place is real charming. I mean, don't get me wrong, it used to be nice, but it's kind of gone to seed since the oil dried up. OWNER: Last call. Closing time, Doc. DEAN: Doc? What, are you a doctor? Uh, I was, yeah. No shit! Mm-hmm. Yeah. I had a pretty good little practice in Century City. DEAN: Is that right? Uh-- if you don't mind my asking, uh-- how the hell does a guy go from being a doctor in LA to tending bar in Purgatory? Well, it's a hell of a lot easier than you think. Well, good night, Doc. Hey, you know what? I would really prefer it if you call me Thomas. Whatever. OK. [car engine stalling] Oh, come on. Come on, come on. Ah, goddammit. [zipper noises] [thunderclap] What the hell is that? OWEN: What the fuck does it look like? What the fuck do you need that for? A brother's got to watch his fucking back out here, all right? Listen, Owen, this isn't a game. Oh, you don't fucking think I know that? You don't fuck with these kind of people, OK? Yeah, no shit. Now you better just get rid of that before they fucking-- [car engine revving] Shit. Oh, this is so fucked up. You just keep your fucking mouth shut, all right? [dog barking] Not by the car. Over there. [car door closes] What do you need? Some crystal meth. Fucking plain old biker crank if that's all you got, bro. How much you got? Well, actually, I was kind of hoping maybe you could hook me up with a couple hundred like you did last time, you know, just to get me going. Goddammit. What do I look like, a fucking credit union to you? OWEN: No, dog. DEALER: You already didn't pay me for the last two times. Yeah, I know, bro, but, I mean, you know I'm fucking good for it. I'm your best fucking customer. You're my best fucking customer? Yeah. You're my worst customer 'cause you never fucking pay me. OWEN: Oh, come on, bro. It ain't-- it ain't like that, man. I'm gonna pay you back. Yeah, and-- Look, I've waiting for like fucking six months for you. OWEN: I know. You're gonna get your fucking money. You're gonna get your fucking money, man. How am I supposed to trust your ass, huh? Huh? OWEN: Please, dog. Please. It's the fucking last time. No! [gunshots] [grunts] [glock clicks] [gunshots] OWEN: [groaning] SUNNY: [whimpering] [car engine revs] [tires screech] [ominous music] THOMAS: Help! Somebody call 911! OWEN: [breathing heavily] OK. OK. You just hang in there, OK? You're gonna be OK. Oh, shit. Help! [brakes squeaking] [tires screech] Are you OK? No. Hey, hey. Come on, come on. Hey, are you with me here? Huh? What the hell are you doing here? This kid's got a gunshot wound. We've got to get him to a hospital. Come on. Come on. Come on. - Oh God. Help me get him in the car. Come on, kid. Come on, hang on. SUNNY: What the hell is going on? DEAN: He's a doctor. What are you talking about? He's a bartender. Never mind, all right. It's a long story. Let's go. [tires screeching] What the hell is going on? A little change in plans. THOMAS: Listen to me. Listen to me, all right. If you care about this kid's life, you're getting back in this car right now and we're going to a hospital. I can't do that, Thomas. My nephew here shot first, the other guy's dead. If they save his life, he's gonna spend the rest of it in prison. OK, so you're just gonna let him die, is that it? I was thinking maybe you could help us. No. Look, I don't have a license. You're a doc, right? Yes, but I'm not a surgeon! Well, just help us get him in the house and see what you can do, all right? I'm on parole, OK? I just did four years. I don't want to do anything to screw that up. Come on, Dean. He's not gonna help us. Give me a hand with him. I'm not promising anything. DEAN: I know. I know. I've never done abdominal surgery, do you understand that? DEAN: I've got his legs here. I mean, you know, I've poked around there a little bit in surgical rotation, that's about it. Do you understand that? DEAN: Yes. But at this point, you're the only hope we got. THOMAS: OK. What the fuck is going-- DEAN: What the hell are you doing? What the fuck happened to him? Who the fuck did that to him? DEAN: A low-life drug dealer. Don't you fucking look at me. Don't you look at me. You stupid fucking bitch. You did that, didn't you? SUNNY: It wasn't my fault. It was fucking Owen's idea! Who the fuck is this faggot? DEAN: He's a doctor. - Yeah, was a doctor. - What? It's not like we had a lot of options. You want to-- Just shut up right now and help me if you want this kid to live, all right? All right. All right. What can we do? I need sheets and towels and tools. W-- w-- what kind of tools? Exacto knife, needle nose, some kind of wire, dental floss, a sewing kit, a vacuum. You get this shit, huh? Iodine, rubbing alcohol, any kind of painkillers. What about me? Oh. You need to get off your feet, all right? Just apply pressure, just like this. I'll get to you as soon as I can, all right? Fuck. Oh, come on. Towels. Towels. Towels. All right. Shit. That's it. That's good. Randy? RANDY: I got it. OK, I've got sheets and, um, needles, all right? OK. THOMAS: There you go. That's it. That's it. Give me some water, right there. Right there on top. Yeah. OK, that's good. The vacuum. [whirring] That's good. DEAN: How does it look? The first thing I gotta do is find the source of the bleeding and try to stop it. What about the bullet? I'm not too worried about that, unless it's up against a nerve. Let me get some more water right here. Right there. That's it, OK. Vacuum. [whirring] OK, that's it. That's it. Oh, he is one lucky boy. Why? I think it's the mesenteric artery. The bullet just nicked it. - Yeah? - Yeah. I should be able to fix this. Give me, uh-- give me the needle and the pliers. Look what you did to him. He's 22 years old. It wasn't my fault. RANDY: Oh. Oh, no. Gee, maybe-- maybe then you can explain to me how he went from getting high every once in a while to getting gunned down in a fucking drug deal. Randy! Don't Randy me. Do not fucking Randy me. This bitch got my brother shot, Dean. Fuck her. Look, I don't want her blood pressure going up, OK? Could you give it a rest? RANDY: Damn. [door slams] Why don't you go lay down somewhere, OK? I'll be in there as soon as I finish up here. SUNNY: Thanks. I-- I need something for my head. OK. Um-- yeah, I've probably got something that could help you out, darling. Come here. I'll be right back, Doc. [slow music] [snoring] Hm. It's not bad for being a little rusty. [quiet knocking] [slow piano music] Hey. - [gasps] Hey, it's OK. It's just me. How are you doing there? OK, I guess. OK, I just want to clean this up. Is he still alive? Yeah, yeah. But he's definitely not out of the woods yet, so. OK, this is gonna sting a little bit, all right? OK. It's all right. It's all right. Sorry. SUNNY: It's OK. So, did you get any sleep? No. No. It's all right. I kind of learned to go without it in med school. Well, you're a lucky girl. It's just an abrasion. Do you think I'll ever play the violin again? You play? No. Well, then I regret to inform you, it's highly unlikely. [laughter] What the fuck is so funny? Uh, nothing. Nothing. I was just finishing up. Is there some place I could crash? [country music] [labored breathing] God damn you. Hey, you want something to eat? I'm not hungry. Listen, I think-- I think we should talk. I'm gonna go, uh, get some smokes. RANDY: You know what? You're not leaving this fucking house ever again until you tell me exactly what happened last night. I already told you everything that I know. That is fucking bullshit and you know it. What happened to you? You never used to be such an asshole. You fucking jerk. Jeez, what a mess. It took me two hours to clean the blood out of that back seat. Dean, can I borrow your car now? Did I not just fucking tell you not to go anywhere? Yeah, sure. Ugh. Jesus. Come on, Randy. Give the girl a break. She's been through a lot. - Excuse me, what about me? I got my first fucking leave in three months. I gotta come home to this shit. DEAN: Now, don't start with me this morning. Goddammit! RANDY: You know what the fuck [inaudible]?? DEAN: What? RANDY: There's one fucking guy that's dead. You know what that means? There's one fucking guy that's alive. And you know what? If I don't put him in the fucking dirt, he's gonna be out there talking. - OK. OK. Take it easy, all right? One step at a time, OK? Hey, Doc. Hey. DEAN: How's he doing? Well, the good news is, I was able to stop the bleeding. But it looks to me like he's starting to slip in septic shock here. What happened? You-- you fucked it up? No. Look, even in an operating room, there's a high risk of infection. All right, I cut your brother up on a dining room table, he's gonna need serious antibiotics, not to mention IV fluids to get his BP back up. Any idea where we can get those? Yeah, I think you got to get him to a hospital. I don't think he's gonna make it if you don't do it. Oh, can't you just write us a prescription for it? It's not Ritalin, Randy. We're talking about surgical-grade antibiotics, OK? Look, I understand that you guys are worried about the police, but this kid is gonna die. No, you don't understand. See, Owen's got two strikes against him. He gets a third conviction, they're gonna send him away for life. Well, at least he'd have a life, huh? Would he? I don't know. That's a decision you two are gonna have to make. In the meantime, I've gotta go to the drug store and get some supplies. I'll go with you. I need something from the drugstore too. No, I think you can let him do it. It's female stuff. So? He's a doctor. Let her go, Randy. Here, here, here, take my car. And, uh, thanks again. You've really gone above and beyond a call on this thing. Stupid shit. Nah. Uh, yeah. Thank you. So what does your wife think about all this? My what? I just-- I noticed your ring. I'm not married anymore. OK. OK, let's not talk about the past. So, um-- what's your future look like? I try not to think about it. Well, come on, you've got to have some kind of a plan. Nope. I don't believe in plans. I used to, but I had one and I fucked it up pretty good so I figure, what's the point, you know? I don't know what you did to wind up in jail, but it couldn't have been that bad. You don't exactly look like the serial killer type to me. [coughing] Well, I guess you don't know me very well, do you? (LAUGHING) Oh. OK, so what did you do, huh? Was it drugs? Embezzlement? No, wait, wait, arson. You've got a thing about matches. No? No. OK, um-- sodomy then. I killed my wife. [laughing] Come on, seriously. What were you in for? Vehicular manslaughter. Reckless endangerment plus a DUI. It usually adds up to about 10 years, but I think the judge figured losing my wife was worth something, so he only gave me five. Jesus. I'm so sorry. [music playing] [brakes squeaking] I'll see you in a minute. [grunting] There you go. Ah. Ow! Surprised to see me, huh? Shut up. [highway noise] I don't give a shit. I just want my goddamn money, bitch. Will you get your hands off her? Fuck off, white bread. Didn't I tell you to fuck off? SUNNY: Johnny, stop it. Hm? STORE OWNER: Wait. [non-english speech] No guns here. [grunts] Could you get your hands off her. JOHNNY: Huh? [grunts] Get out of here. I call police. Call the police. I'll put a fucking cap on you, man. So you think I'm stupid, huh, bitch? I'll fucking hunt you down. What are you looking at, huh? Here. Here, Cheetos. STORE OWNER: You leave this place right now! Are you OK? Yeah, I'm fine. Let's get out of here. You too, get out! That was a pretty slick move you pulled back there. Well, you know. Did they teach you that in med school too? No, no. I learned that in the showers back at [inaudible].. [chuckles] [dramatic music] Oh my god. I don't believe that son of a bitch. Wait a minute. You know who did this? Fucking Johnny Ramos! This was my grandmother's Bible. THOMAS: All right, let me, uh-- let me help you, OK? SUNNY: [crying] Oh god. OK. We can get this cleaned up here. Oh, no. What? It's the only picture I have left of my mom. [sobbing] Oh god. Sunny, Sunny, Sunny, it's OK. I gotta get out of this goddamn town. You will, Sunny. Will you help me? You don't need me, Sunny. Yes I do. Yes I do. You can take me back to LA with you. No, I'm-- actually not going back anytime soon. Oh, well can go someplace else then. Anywhere we want to. Thailand, maybe. Thailand? I came here to lay low, all right? I think in the last 24 hours I committed like seven parole violations, and now you want me to just skip town, right? - Yeah. Yeah. I mean, think about it, Thomas. It could be amazing. Well, yeah. We could just lie on the beach all day covered in coconut oil, drinking Mai Tais. Or-- or you could work as a doctor again. Start your own little clinic. Go to Thailand? Mm-hmm. God, you're-- you're just so beautiful. I want you to. No, we can't. It's OK. It's OK. Just let yourself go. [banging] Oh. What the hell are you doing here? And who the fuck did this? Who do you think? Yeah, it must have been Owen's dealer. We had a little run in with him at the store. His name's Johnny Ramos. You know, Owen has his number around here someplace. So how long you two been here? Uh-- just a couple of minutes. I was going to re-bandage her arm. Yeah, I'll bet. SUNNY: I found it. It's his pager, I think. I'm gonna kill this fucking guy. I mean, you fuck with a Mecklin, you fuck with the whole clan. - I'm gonna go take a shower. - [clears throat] All right. You know, you better watch yourself. Excuse me? Just because we live in a backward fucking town doesn't mean we're a bunch of goddamn morons. OK. Well, I'll keep that in mind. What, you just think you're so smart, don't you? Well, you don't know shit. Don't go too far, Doc. We may need you again. [music playing] [sighing] [music on tv] [slow country music] Son of a bitch. [upbeat music] What the hell is this? I asked for a scotch and soda. [phone ringing] This tastes like bourbon. I can't stand bourbon. Roy's Bar. It's for you. All right. Look, I don't want people calling you here. THOMAS: I'm sorry. Yeah, hello? SUNNY (ON PHONE): I was upset that we didn't get a chance to say goodbye today. I'm just glad to hear your voice. Are you OK? SUNNY (ON PHONE): Yeah. How about you? Oh, great. Great. Just, I've been thinking about you all day, that's all. So, I mean, I was worried about you. SUNNY (ON PHONE): Uh-huh. So, uh-- how's your arm feeling? SUNNY (ON PHONE): It hurts a little. I was hoping-- oh shit. I got-- I gotta go. Wait, wait. Now, Sunny-- Sunny, when can see you again? [dial tone] Hey, new guy, who do I have to fuck to get a drink around here? [grunting] All right. Good night, Roy. Mm. There we go. Oh. Oh, now what? Hey, hey, buddy. Hey. How's it going? I think we found a place to get the medicine you were talking about. Oh, great. Uh-- what was it we needed? Oh, well, uh, definitely amp and gent would be your best bet. Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down. Uh-- write this down. It's ampicillin and gentamicin. You know what? You probably ought to get a bunch of saline if you can. OK. OK. If you guys could get your hands on a few units of O negative blood, I could probably get his BP back up. Goddammit, Dean, I can't spell this shit. I-- he-- he's coming-- you're coming with us. - Dean, I can't. - I'm not asking. I think it's a good idea, just-- just this one last thing. See, that way you can give Owen the stuff, and, uh-- we'll be out of your hair. What if I don't? [dramatic music] [gun cocks] Thanks. [brakes squeaking] That's the phone line right there. You know what you're doing here, right? All these alarms run off the phone line. One wire, boom, you're in. - Oh, OK. Great. Great. Why don't you just take me back to the state pen while you're at it here, Dean? No, no, you'll be in and out in a couple of minutes. You've got nothing to worry about. Well, look, look. At some point I do have to draw a line between generosity and stupidity here. RANDY: Well, not right now. [glass shattering] You better go. Come on. My guess is what we're looking for is right in here. I'm gonna need to get in there. [zipper] [clatter] [suspenseful music] [car engine running] [phone ringing] Hey, why is the phone ringing? I thought that you-- [exciting music] Door. Freeze! Oh, shit. Don't shoot. Don't shoot. Drop the bag and get on the ground. Hey, easy there, OK? I said get on the ground. OK, you got us. OK, we're going down. Just take it easy, OK? Let me see your hands. No, no, no, no. You don't want to do that. You don't want to do that. Base, this is car four. I've got two, uh-- Caucasian, uh-- THOMAS: Shit. These two guys just came running out of the building. BASE (ON RADIO): Car four, just maintain your position there. I'll call the sheriffs, OK? [grunts] [thud] - Come on, let's go. BASE (ON RADIO): Car four, do you copy? Come on. BASE (ON RADIO): Car four. Roger, is there something wrong with your radio? Roger? Roger? Car four, Roger, do you need some backup? RANDY: [grunts] Dude, I'll kill you, you son of a bitch! DEAN: Randy, what in the hell is the matter with you? RANDY: He saw my face, Dean. He saw my fucking face! DEAN: Goddamn, we gotta get out of here now. No! Not before we take care of this shit. We've got to get out of here now, OK? I swear to God, if you try and stop me, I will fucking drop you. Well, then kiss your little brother goodbye. Come on. Come on, now. Come on. [buzzing] Hey, Sunny. Sunny? What'd you give her? A little something to calm her down. What do you mean calm her down? She's almost comatose. - Don't worry about her. Your patient's over here. [sighs] [groans] [slow music] [sighs] [buzzing] RANDY: [snorting] Oh crap. We really gotta tie up some of those loose ends today. Yeah, no shit. I'll make sure that big bastard's out of the picture. What are we gonna do about him? Nothing. I mean it, Randy. He went out on a limb to help us. Just-- I don't trust him. I just-- I don't like the way he's always looking at Sunny. Just take care of Johnny. We'll worry about him later. All right. I'm gonna take a shower. [groaning] Oh. I hope you take it black, 'cause that's all we got. Thanks. You sleep OK? Like a hundred bucks. [chuckles] THOMAS: Where's Sunny? Mm. Still sleeping. I moved her into Owen's room. See, look, his color's a lot better now. Yeah. [chuckles] He looks good. I guess you were right about those drugs, huh? I guess so. Can I get a ride home? Thomas, I gotta say, you are one hell of a doctor. You pulled off a miracle here. Well, hey, don't get your hopes up, Dean. That kid's still got a rough road ahead of him. Oh, I hear you. I hear you. You know, it's a shame to think of you wasting all-- Holy shit. We can't let them find Owen. Randy! Randy! Get your ass out here! RANDY: What? I'm in the fucking shower. Cops! Hold this above his head. Hold it above his head. DEAN: All right, all right, all right. RANDY: Let's take him back to my room. DEAN: Ah! Damn it. [glass shatters] RANDY: We'll put him in the closet. Let's go. DEAN: Go, go, go, go. Here we go. Just get in there. RANDY: Watch it, watch it, watch it. [doorbell rings] I got it. [knocking] Coming. Holy shit. [doorbell rings] [knocking] Be right there. [yawns] What's going on? [gasps] [grunts] Hey, Travis. What's up? TRAVIS: Can we come in a sec. DEAN: Yeah. Come on in. TRAVIS: How you been? DEAN: Good, good. And you? Hey, Stan. Do you want a cup of coffee or something? No, thanks. Got a fresh pot. No. Is Randy here? No. No, no. He's down at Pendleton. Well, isn't that his car parked out there? DEAN: Yeah, yeah, yeah. He left it here after basic. Why? Did something happen? Oh, now, someone was shot and killed down at Hoskins the other night. Oh, Jesus Christ. Who? Ah, just some dirtbag crack dealer. The problem is that, uh-- the gun traced back to Randy. Are you sure? Huh. Maybe somebody stole it from him. Well, you know, that was my first thought. I called over to the base to talk to him. It turns out he's AWOL. They haven't seen him in three days. Oh, Jesus Christ! AWOL? I had no idea. No idea. So you think that, uh-- he's involved with this? TRAVIS: I don't know. They did find a second pool of blood, so somebody else got shot pretty bad. But I don't think it was Randy. I checked the blood type against the military records. It wasn't any match. DEAN: I don't know what to tell you. I don't even know how to get a hold of him. Randy has always been a handful. But I tried. You of all people know how I tried. [clears throat] Those kids. Ever since their father died. TRAVIS: Yeah, I know. Some kids, they just don't want to learn. Especially those two. I say black, they say white. It's always been that way with them. Whoo, it's hot today, huh? You sure I can't get you guys an iced tea or something to drink? TRAVIS: Hey, where is Owen and that, uh-- pretty little girlfriend of his? Wife. Holy cow, he married her? [laughing] Yeah, yeah. A couple of months ago. Matter of fact, they're on their honeymoon right now. A belated honeymoon up in, uh, Santa Cruz. Well, God bless him. I hope it lasts. [laughing] [clatter] TRAVIS: What the hell was that? DEAN: I wonder. I thought you were the only one here. Yeah, uh-- it's, um-- Oh, um-- I'm sorry. I didn't know anyone was here. Hey, hey, hey. Wait just a minute. What happened to your arm? Oh. Uh-- I cut it on a gate at the stable the other day. TRAVIS: Uh-huh. When did you get back here? Back? From Santa Cruz. Oh, uh-- uh-- yesterday. Oh. Look, I'm kind of tired. I just woke up. Is there any coffee? In the kitchen. Listen, Dean, you do not want to be pulling my chain. Now, I came here as a friend. I know. I know. I know. It's just, uh-- it's just that, uh-- she and Owen had a fight. She came back all hysterical. I don't want to hear about their dirty laundry, you know? So, uh, you wouldn't mind if we kind of took a look around? No, no. Go ahead. [suspenseful music] TRAVIS: Hey, Stan, come here. Gone for three months, right? [sighs] If you see or hear anything from Randy, you tell him I'm looking to talk to him, Dean. Do you understand me? - You bet. All right. OK. Uh, see you. [sighs] What the fuck were they looking for? You. Found one of your goddamn guns where Owen was shot. What? Yeah, Owen must have stole it. And what the hell were you thinking? I'm sorry, I-- Shut up! Has the seriousness of this fucking situation failed to [inaudible] you, huh? Hey, hey, Dean, why don't you take it easy? You stay out of this. [whimpering] And you, you stupid piece of shit. Randy, you went AWOL? It's none of your goddamn business, Dean. Three generations of Mecklin served in the corps with a perfect service record till now. You fucking coward. You're a disgrace to the family name. The family name's a fucking joke. If your daddy heard you say that-- [rifle cocks] Don't even talk about my daddy. He hated you. Shit, I hate you. The only reason I'm even letting you stay here is you're so pathetic, you can't stand on your own two feet. Put the fucking gun down. You better pick a fucking gun up. Just put that fucking gun down! Shut up, please. This is not helping. We've got to get Owen out of that closet. Now, Randy, will you give me a hand? Come on. Would you put your fucking clothes on? I'm so sick you walking around this house in your underwear like a fucking whore. DEAN: Are you OK? Sorry you had to hear all that. Yeah. Don't worry about it. Kids. Whatever happened to respect? That's what I like about you. The minute I met you, I knew you were a man of character. Honorable. Trustworthy. Thomas. Thomas. Listen, uh-- I know this can't begin to cover your services, but, uh-- I want you to take this. You've been real Christian-like, and this family will always be in your debt. - That's OK. All right? - Don't insult me, buddy. Thanks a lot. DEAN: We'll be in touch. THOMAS: I was not flirting with her. I was not flirting with her. It's OK. I think it's cute. You are so goddamn beautiful. I think it's cute. THOMAS: You are so goddamn beautiful. [tires screeching] [grunting] Come on. [screams] Now, you, uh, you hang in there, Owen, all right? [sighs] And don't-- don't you worry, um-- I'm gonna find that-- that fucking guy, all right? [clears throat] [upbeat music] TRAVIS: Hey, Roy, how's business? Oh, evening, Detective. TRAVIS: Just give me a Bud. Listen, you seen anything of them Mecklin boys around here lately? Dean came in here the other day, and, uh, then, uh, that younger one come in and talk to him. Owen? Uh, yeah, yeah. The one with the cute little wife. [chuckles] When I was his age, I couldn't get run over by a piece of ass like that. [laughter] Do you remember when that was? ROY: I don't know off hand. What about him? ROY: Oh, well, he's new in town. He don't know anyone. Ain't that right, Doc? Doc? Uh, it's Thomas, actually. Oh, that's right. He's, uh-- sensitive about that. Are you a doctor? Well, I was, in, uh-- in Los Angeles. TRAVIS: Huh. You know, we had a break-in at a medical office last night. You think you might answer some questions for me? Uh-- no. Uh-- you know, I'm not sure I'll be much help, but go ahead. Well, the third time they've hit this place this year. Teenagers getting in there stealing drugs, you know. But for some reason, they took a shitload of intravenous antibiotics. Now, can you think of any reason maybe, down there in LA, the kids are getting high off of a IV drip? [laughing] I don't know. I wouldn't put it past them. So do you, um-- do you know the kids who did this? No. We have a witness, but the poor bastard got hit in the head with a brick, and he can't remember anything since Easter. Oh, now I remember. It was the night of that thunderstorm. Yes. TRAVIS: Yeah. Yes it was. Um-- Wednesday? Yeah. Yeah, I think that was Wednesday. Well, that's just a couple of days ago. ROY: Uh-huh. TRAVIS: Are you sure about that, Roy? ROY: Oh, yeah. She was something to see. You remember her, don't you, Thomas? Yeah. Yeah, I think I do, actually. Did you happen to notice whether she had a wound on her arm? Well, you know, I really wasn't looking at her arm. [laughter] Hey, uh, Roy, can I get that break now? Oh, OK. OK. OK. See you. [phone ringing] Yeah? THOMAS (ON PHONE): Hey. Hey, Dean, it's Thomas. Hey. THOMAS (ON PHONE): Hey, look, um-- I just thought you might like to know that, you know, that detective? He just came by the bar and is asking a bunch of questions. Uh-huh. Are you in the middle of something? DEAN (ON PHONE): Yeah. I'll talk to you later. THOMAS (ON PHONE): OK. Uh-- how's Owen doing? DEAN (ON PHONE): The same. Call me later. - What about Sunny? How's she doing? DEAN (ON PHONE): Look, I gotta go. Call me tomorrow. - OK. I just-- [dial tone] You want this? (QUIETLY) Yeah. Yeah. DEAN: You want that, hm? [moaning] Here it comes. Here it comes. There you go, baby. There you go. That's my baby, hm? [buzzing] [suspenseful music] Hi, Arlene. [bell jingles] [sizzling] SUNNY: I want you to, huh? I want you to. THOMAS: OK. SUNNY: I want you to. [moaning] [beep] DEAN (ON ANSWERING MACHINE): You missed us. Leave a message. [beep] [dialing] [engine sputtering] [upbeat music] Sunny? Sunny? SUNNY: [moaning] THOMAS: [grunting] BOTH: [moaning] Oh god. Oh my god. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, oh, yeah. Mm. Oh. Oh. Oh. THOMAS: What is that? Shh. Oh shit. Oh. [bag rustling] [dramatic music] [grunting] [groans] [exhales loudly] Those drips. OK. Where the hell did they put those drips? DEAN: What are you doing here? Um-- Sunny called and said that, uh, Owen wasn't breathing so well. There's some extra drips around here. Do you know where Randy stashed them? They're probably still in the closet. Oh. Where's Sunny? Shower, I think. Mm-hmm. You didn't know about them, did you? No, I can't say that I did. Yeah. They were crazy about each other, and just about drove each other crazy. They were on one hell of a wild ride. Spent everything his daddy left him in a matter of months. When she finally broke it off, he was homicidal. He didn't know whether he was gonna kill her or himself. So he went to join the Marines, just get her out of his mind. It was either that or the psych ward. You want a sandwich? No. No thanks. How'd she end up with Owen? Once you've had to Mecklin, there's no going back, I guess. [laughter] Dean, you're funny. By the way, your fly is open. [machinery noise] [rock music] [neck cracks] [knocking] JOHNNY: Yo, who is it? RANDY: I want to score some shit. JOHNNY: [grunts] What the fuck is this? You fucked with the wrong family, motherfucker. I don't even know who you are, man. Yeah? Well, I know who the fuck you are. You shot my fucking brother, you piece of shit. JOHNNY: No, please. You gotta listen to me, man. It wasn't my idea. She made me do it. - Who? Sunny. Don't you fucking lie to me. JOHNNY: I swear to God. I'm tell telling the truth. She even gave me the gun to do it. Hey, Dean. Hey. When did you get back? DEAN: A while ago. SUNNY: How's he doing, Doc? Oh, the sedative wore off. I gave him another dose. You did the right thing calling me, Sunny. Can you take that outside? Hey, can I get one of those? Yeah. You smoke? Sometimes. So you used to go out with Randy? So? So, were you planning on telling me this? Jesus. You're starting to sound like a goddamn Mecklin. Just so you know, that sedative I gave Owen is gonna wear off in a couple of hours, all right. And I don't really want to be around here when he wakes up and starts talking. So do something about it. Like what? You're a doctor. Figure something out. You know what I think we should do? I think we should go right now, you and me, to Thailand, just like we talked about. What do you say? We could do this, Sunny. Yeah, but he's still gonna wake up in a couple of hours and spill his guts. We'll be long gone by then. It's just gonna look worse if we disappear, Thomas. Come on, you know that. I can't just keep sedating him. What if he never woke up? Then we wouldn't have to keep looking over our shoulders for the rest of our lives. Jesus, Sunny, you know what you're saying? Well, come on. You'd been doing the world a favor. He's not Mother Teresa for God's sake. He's a goddamn piece of shit. Well, he's your husband, OK? Can't you see who these people are? What they've done to me? Why don't you run away? Why don't you just go? Because it isn't that simple, Thomas. I mean, people have obligations. What? To who, Randy? To Dean? Look, Owen cheated a drug dealer and got shot. He-- he wouldn't even be alive if you hadn't come along and messed with fate. All I want you to do is to put it back the way it was. I don't know if I could do that, Sunny. No, I know you. I know you can. If not to save yourself, then at least to save me. Dammit, would you quit stalling? It's here somewheres. I got everything, man. Her asking me how to do it, how much she was gonna pay me. I even got her bragging about how she was gonna spend Owen's inheritance money. You better not be shitting me. I'm not, man. I swear to you. That's why I got it. That's why I made this. It's a little insurance policy for me. You know-- you know what I mean? Man, you-- you promise me now that if I give you this tape, you're not gonna kill me, right, man? Jesus Chr-- That's what I said, yes. You promise me? Huh? Cool, man. [gunshots] [thud] MAN (ON TV): Buy it, and the fish love the Silver Slider back in this corner. I had a couple bites. I haven't got anything in yet. But let me tell you, this isn't gonna take long. It ain't gonna take long with this thing. I can see under-- - Too much fish? MAN (ON TV): Come on, baby. Come on. Oh, he got away. - Nope. MAN (ON TV): But you ain't gonna get away for long. DEAN: Hm. This one here's my blue Silver Streak. You don't have to work today? No, not until 6:00. You? Closed up early. I wanted to come back here in case Travis came snooping around again. Oh, yeah. MAN (ON TV): That's about a five-pounder there, Billy, let me tell you. [suspenseful music] This one here I call Black Gold. This thing gets deep in the willows when it's cold out-- Well, I better get going. OK. See you. THOMAS: All right. Ah, shit. He's burning up. I think he went into shock. I'm gonna need some ice, Dean. DEAN: I got some in the fridge. THOMAS: No, I'm talking about three or four big bags of ice. OK. I'll run to the store. OK. Sunny, you come with me. [dramatic music] What the hell am I doing? [squeaking] [grunting] [exclaims] OWEN: [groans] [grunting] [crash] [grunts] [groaning] [exhales slowly] Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Fuck. This is not happening. This is not fucking happening. [rock music] [grunting] Let's go. [gravel crunching] [car door closes] What the fuck are you doing here? I've got some bad news. His excessive blood loss led to a state of hypovolemic shock. I tried to boost his BP with the saline, but I just couldn't sustain him. Then he went into severe cardiac arrest. RANDY: Oh. [crying] I'm gonna leave you two, OK? Wait. What's that? Well, he started convulsing when he went into arrest. It got pretty ugly. Are you here alone? Yeah. Yeah? Where's Sunny? I sent her and Dean to get some ice for Owen. Oh. You killed him, didn't you, huh, you stupid son of a bitch? Fuck you. I've been busting my ass all week trying to save his ass. Did Sunny pay you to do this, huh? Huh, did she? Just like she did with Johnny fucking Ramos? What? Don't play fucking dumb with me! I got proof. Yeah. Yeah, he gave me this shit before I put a fucking bullet through his head. - I swear to God, Randy. I don't know what the fuck you're talking about. Oh, you just thought you fucking knew it all, didn't you? Huh, Doc? Well, who's the dumb ass now, huh? Oh, don't even fucking think about it. Now that the patient's gone apparently we won't need your services anymore now, will we, Doc? What the hell is going on? Owen! Owen! No! No! [crying] Oh, my baby. DEAN: Did he? Oh damn. You murdering bitch. Put the gun down and let her go. RANDY: What the fuck are you doing? I mean it or I'll drop your ass right now, Randy. You've got no fucking idea what's going on here, Dean. She paid that fucking wetback to shoot Owen. And when it didn't fucking work, she got the doc here to finish him off. THOMAS: It's bullshit. He went into shock. You were here when it happened, Dean. Yeah? Well, how did he end up with a big fucking hole in his chest? No, don't you fucking move. THOMAS: It was an accident, I swear. Come on, Dean, I'm a doctor. I could never do anything to hurt this boy. Did you fuck her? Did you? You don't want to go there. What the fuck are you guys talking about? OK, Sunny. Go ahead. Show him your track marks. You just shut the fuck up. THOMAS: When did you first get her started? Was it when she was with Owen or back when she was with Randy? I don't know what the hell he's talking about. I guess that's the only way you can get laid, huh? You sick fuck. [gunshot] [screams] [gunshots] [gunshots] Who's my baby? Oh. [exciting music] [grunts] Look, will you get out of here? - What? - Get out of here! You're on your own, all right? [gunshots] Ah! Go! Go! [car engine starts] [crash] [click] [crashing] Hurry! He's getting in the car. [crash] Oh! [tires screeching] Sunny, can you get the key to this thing? Get the key. Right there. SUNNY: OK. [tires screeching] Uh. [gunshot] Oh God. [gunshots] [tires screeching] I got it. [thud] Goddammit. [groaning] [truck horn honking] [car horn honking] [tires screeching] Oh shit. I got it! All right. Hold on. SUNNY: [screaming] [crash] [car engine revving] Come on. SUNNY: [screams] [car engine revving] [thud] [screams] [gunshot] [screams] [gunshot] Shit. [gunshot] [tires screech] [explosion] SUNNY: So where do we go from here? What do you mean "we"? What's wrong? What's wrong? Five people are dead because of you, Sunny. That's what's wrong. - Because of us. - That's bullshit. I didn't kill anyone. Owen's death was an accident. I was desperate to get away from them, and I couldn't see any other way out. You know, neither of us are angels, Thomas. But we have something. Something that doesn't come along every day. And I know-- I know that if we could just get out of Purgatory Flats, we could be great together. OK. So what do we do about Dean and Owen? - What do you mean? - What do you mean, what? We can't just leave them there. We've got to do something. I mean, you know, maybe-- maybe we could try to make it look like they disappeared or something like that, you know? OK. OK. Um-- you go back to your apartment and pack up. I'll go to the house and get started. Why don't we do that together? [car engine starts] [suspenseful music] What happened to his gun? I don't know. [gravel crunching] THOMAS: [grunting] [click] [gravel crunching] Hurry up. These two are beginning to stink. All right. You want to give me a hand with the bodies here? SUNNY: I don't think so. What are you doing? I didn't want it to come to this, Thomas, but you just won't let me do what I need to do. What are you talking about? Owen is going to the county morgue so he can be pronounced dead and I can collect his inheritance. Jesus, Sunny. Is that what this is all about, a few lousy bucks? 10,000 lousy bucks. [laughing] What? What's so goddamn funny? Um-- I-- I used to make that in a week. Oh. [clicking] [sighs] I don't think so. [exclaims] Oh. [breathing heavily] Are you gonna kill me, Thomas? Huh? Just like you killed your wife? THOMAS: [grunts] SUNNY: Oh! [thudding] Well? Just do it, Thomas. Why don't you put me out of my fucking misery? (SOBBING) It's the only way I'll ever get out of this fucking place. You know what, Sunny? I'm not doing any more favors for you. SUNNY: No! No, no, no! No, no! Fuck you, Thomas! Put me down! No, no, no, no. [trunk closes] [screaming] Thomas! [car engine starts] JOHNNY (ON TAPE): $10,000? Where are you gonna get that kind of money, huh? SUNNY (ON TAPE): It's just sitting in a bank waiting to be spent. What the fuck? Where did you get that? JOHNNY (ON TAPE): You're a dangerous fucking lady. Thomas! I'll kill you, Thomas! I swear to God I'll tear your fucking heart out, you son of a bitch! SUNNY (ON TAPE): We'll go to Thailand. JOHNNY (ON TAPE): Thailand? SUNNY (ON TAPE): Yeah. JOHNNY (ON TAPE): What are we gonna do in Thailand? SUNNY (ON TAPE): We'll go to Thailand and we'll lie on the beach. [pounding] SUNNY: Get me out of here! Thomas! God! Thomas, I'll tear your fucking heart out, you son of a bitch! Take care of yourself, Sunny. SUNNY: What? What the fuck? What? [phone ringing] Detective McGill. Yeah. Yeah, I remember you. THOMAS (ON PHONE): Yeah. I got something I thought you might be interested in regarding that shooting of the Mecklin kid. Uh-huh. If you need me, you know where to find me, all right? OK. [slow music] [pounding] Open this fucking door! Hey, Ed, you better get down here. You're not gonna believe this one. [screaming] Hey, hey. Are you OK? Yeah. Well, I'm glad you called. Me too. [upbeat music] [MUSIC, "WIDE STRETCH IN THE ROAD"] I had a lover, and I left her in the dust in a Barracuda painted blue. Going 90 and she blew my trust. I said, baby, this is you. I left her standing with a couple of bucks for a biscuit and a bottle of beer. I pulled away, I heard, man, it sucks. What the hell am I doing here in this wide stretch in the road? Just a wide stretch in the road. She always travels light. She always wipes things clean. She always doubles back and doubles down. There's winners and losers and nothing in between, and there's always another mark around. She was never one for [inaudible] like her wires were crossed. She dragged the bottom of the wishing well. She's nobody's baby and nobody's boss. She's a little of heaven in the middle of hell in this wide stretch in the road. Just a wide stretch in the road. [inaudible] another death with every breath. They're holding onto nothing as the brakes give way. And there's nothing as strong and there's nothing as tough as a kind love when you can't get enough. And you can't get wiser, it all explodes. And you can't keep shooting, and you can't reload. It's just a wide stretch in the road. Just a wide stretch in the road. The wind, it never stops, and the heat will rise, and a highway never bends. The heart dries up and just blows away. [inaudible] It's the same refrain of the driving rain. No wind in sight to this drought. Truth to tell, there's not a hope in hell. Once you're in it, you're never getting out of this wide stretch in the road. Wide stretch in the road. Wide stretch in the road. Just a wide stretch in the road.
