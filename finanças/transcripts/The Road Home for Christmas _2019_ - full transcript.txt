Where is he? Sorry, excuse me, excuse me. Pardon me. Thank you. Sorry, sorry, sorry. Merry Christmas! I’m trying to call him. I can’t believe he’s my partner. I told you. You would’ve said no and just done Artist’s Night on Wednesdays. No! That’s only one night. Plus it’s half the amount of tips that I make with this doofus. That’s because the audience likes y’all. I think it’s the actual contempt they can feel from all of the... piano dueling. He just gets under my skin. Sorry, sorry. Where have you been? Car troubles. Hello! We were supposed to go on 10 minutes ago. Let me guess, Lindsey. You’re upset about something. Yeah. That talent manager is here tonight. Oh, right. I’m not gonna let you mess this up for me. I know that you’re new to this, but managers, they don’t like to be kept waiting. I totally forgot that he was coming. Well, go. Without further ado and no introduction necessary, Keys on Bourbon welcomes you to Dueling Pianos with Lindsey Scott and Wes Bailey. Christmas edition. Merry Christmas, everyone. Ho ho ho. We are just five short days away from Christmas, if you can believe it, and we’re just really happy that you can be here with us tonight celebrating. Ooh. So here’s how this works. We are dueling for your favor. You see those tip jars right there? That is how we know who has won the duel. The more that you put in one, that’s how you show us who you want your winner to be. Probably me. Now we’re gonna play some fun songs for you guys tonight, and if you like what I’m doing... I’m sure that you will... fill up my jar. Should we get started? - Ready when you are. - Let's do it. Thank you so much, folks. We have one more song for you tonight. And as always, the wonderful Erica will tabulate your generous tips to see who won the piano duel. Oh, I think we all know who this amazing audience is gonna chose. Before we begin our final medley of the night, I just, I just want to share a sentiment that my mom always used to say. Christmas is about spending time with the ones that you love. You know, sitting on the couch, unwrapping a gift, or putting together a new toy, setting up the VCR. This was the 90's, kids. Remember that? Thank you so much for coming out with us tonight.

I told you I keep tracking it every single day, but the cheapest flight I could get is January 2nd. It’s really expensive. Well, Baby Rudolph is due January 3rd, and it won’t wait just because you’re late. I know, I know. I promise the second I get the money from the governor’s party, I’m gonna book my flight. It’ll be nonstop, first-class. Or at least nonstop. So the governor’s party is that important, huh? Allie, we’ve been over this. I’m just saying you’re missing Christmas with the whole family. I know, I know. But it’s 500 people at the governor’s mansion, and he’s asked me to play. He’s asked us to play. Plus, I really need the money, you know? And that way, I could take two weeks off to see little Baby Rudolph get born. Okay, yes, I appreciate that. I know we’re kidding with this whole Rudolph thing, but it’s kind of growing on me. Yeah, like Mom would let that happen. Besides, she’s moved on to another reindeer. She didn’t like that Rudolph was a boy’s name, you know, because we were trying to keep the baby’s sex a secret. Oh. Rudolph for a boy and Rudi for a girl? That’s pretty cute. Well, get here sooner, and maybe you’ll have a say. Okay, I gotta go. I’m gonna call you tomorrow, okay? Flight. Book it. Okay, will do. Wes, Lindsey. This is Robby Mailer from French Quarter Music Management. Great to meet you, Wes. Hey there, gorgeous. Listen, I don’t have long. My car’s outside. But I just wanted to pop by and say that you guys were so great. I mean, so great. I’m sure we'll be in touch. Oh, you know, I have this for you. It’s just some covers and some original music I’ve been working on. Excellent, excellent. Yeah, by the way, if you ever wanna jam or anything, I’m pretty flexible. Studio, on the road. Whatever. Makes no difference to me. Yeah, dude, I like it. Whoa, dude. This arm! It’s hard as a rock! - Tell me you golf. - Yeah. You know what? We gotta go golfing. - Let's go. - All right, cool. I’ll tell you what. I’ll give you a ring. - Sounds good. - All right, see you later, Wes. All right. Oh, you forgot this. Hmm. Thanks. Good show, you guys. Ticket sales, door account, and... tips. Split 50/50. Oh, before I forget, the governor’s assistant called tonight, and he has to cancel the party. What? - Cancel? - Why? Apparently, his entire family caught the ox flu. Sorry, ox flu? Yeah, that’s what he said, so he had to cancel. It’s less than five days until Christmas. Can he even do that? Uh, yeah. Great. Now what are we supposed to do? I don’t know, go home for Christmas? Hey, Wes, can you hang back a bit? Linds. Lindsey. Hey. Uh, Lindsey. Hey, hey, Lindsey. Wait, Lindsey, Lindsey, hold up. - What do you want? - Jeez! Listen, I needed that money to help pay for my ticket, so I could go see my new niece or nephew, so I’m just really upset right now. No, I know, I know, I know. Me too. Do you need something, Wes? Uh, can I get a ride? My car’s down here. Hey, so your sister’s having a baby, huh? - Yup. - That’s cool Now I just have to get to Akron. Akron? You’re from Akron? Not Akron. A small town outside of Akron called Rootstown. I’m from Kent. Kent in Ohio? Went to Kent Roosevelt. We played you guys in football. Senior year, homecoming. Beat you. You know what? I was the senior class president, and you guys totally ruined the vibe of our homecoming dance. Well, as I remember it, that deejay did play nothing but... Enya. I know. Although at the end, the music did get pretty good. That’s because I fired the guy and totally took over. I can’t believe we've never talked about this before. - That’s crazy. - Wow. - Okay, so... - Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas! Ho ho! You wanna go home for Christmas, I wanna go home for Christmas, flights are too expensive, so... So? - Road trip! - Uh, no. Yeah, what do you say? We leave first thing in the morning. It’s a 15-hour drive. We can get there before Christmas with plenty of time to spare. No. We’re not going on a road trip. I’m not that bad. Are you sure you wanna do this? Road trip over Christmas? Yeah! I’m not so sure I am. Come on. What’s the worst thing that could happen? Yeah, it was fine. Did that music manager guy show up? - Yeah, he was there. - And did you talk to him? Did you give him that sample thing you were working on? I mean, a little bit, and yes, I did. But it wasn’t even finished. It was stupid. Probably just another rejection Well, you never know. And now tell me again who this boy is that you’re driving with. He’s my dueling piano partner, Mom. He’s completely obnoxious, and he’s already making us late! Well, I know you’re not so happy about the governor’s party being canceled, but I am so happy you’re coming home for Christmas. I know. Me too. I can’t wait to see you guys and meet Baby Blitzen. Don’t get me started on all that silliness. Won’t even tell the grandmother if it’s a boy or a girl. Anyway... I was thinking about this, and I know you needed the money from the party. - Mom... - I can help you out if you need. No, no. I’m an adult. You know, I’m also a musician. Gigs get cancelled. Plus, I budget for these things. I’m good. Don't worry. Well, as long as you say so. I just can’t help but wonder if all of this is a sign or something. You know, the governor’s party got canceled, that music manager barely looked in my direction. Maybe I’m getting tired. Don’t say that, honey. All right, Mom, I gotta go. I love you. - Morning. - You’re late. Charming. By the way, we’re gonna have to trade out driving every like hour so. I got a bad back. Of course you do. Okay, well, it’s gonna seriously affect our driving schedule. You made an actual driving schedule. Don’t roll your eyes at me. This is gonna get us there faster, so we could spend the least amount of time together. Ooh, good thinking. Uh-oh, look at that. You forgot something. What? That’s impossible. Yeah, no, look, you forgot to schedule "Show annoying driving schedule to Wes." Look, now we’re two minutes behind. Oh, you know what I did remember to schedule though? Hmm. Quiet time for Wes. And that starts right now. Do you mind if we just switch up the music a little bit? Hmm? What about, um, Cassie’s Christmas record? Oh, you’re a Cassie fan, huh? Huge Cassie fan. She was actually the reason I became a singer. Actually, my buddy Mark, he’s on tour with her right now. He plays guitar in her band. How are you so well-connected? I’m a pretty well-liked person? I don’t know if you know what that would be like. I talk to people who talk to me back. Okay, whatever. I just need a little change from the jazz for a second. I don’t care what we listen to. You live in New Orleans, and you don’t like jazz? No, I’m not saying that I don't like jazz. That’s just... That’s kind of more your thing, you know? I’m a classically trained pianist. Well, that explains it. Explains what? - Why you can’t improvise. - What? I’m just saying you’re not good at it. It’s the classical training. They beat it out of everyone. Excuse me. I took a jazz improv class at Tulane University. Of course you did. Okay, fine. I will admit that is not my specialty. At least I can sing on key. I’m just saying. Wow. Okay, okay, you know what? I can admit my weaknesses. You might have a better voice than I do, but I’m the better improviser. - Okay, fine. - And for the record, it’s not that you that have perfect picture anything. - I’m just saying... - Okay, you know what? Let's just stop talking. See ya, Wes! All right, guys. Yeah, that sounds great. I’m gonna email you right now. Let's do it. Ho ho ho! What... What was that? What? The Santas. Oh, they invited me to use their timeshare in Palm Springs. Evidently, the wives just love it. What, there was a long line. And the Santa thing? Oh, they’re on their way to Jackson for the convention. Hmm. This is so we could drive through the night. Okay, well, we should probably go to the bathroom while we have the time. Hmm. I don’t know if we can. But if we can divert from the schedule... You are so funny, Wes Bailey. Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up, hurry up. Gotta go. Gotta go. Come on. Hey, yo, Robby, it’s Wes Bailey. Erica said to give you a call today. Wes, yeah, awesome, awesome. Listen, I got a great gig for you. A gig? Really? Wow, that was fast. Hey. Well, hi, Gloomy Gus. Sorry, Allie. Just a little annoyed right now. But you’re excited to see me soon, right? So what... What is it? You, my friend, are gonna be touring with Aaron Baker Longman. Wait, what? No way. Oh, yeah, you’re gonna love it too. Aaron is, of course, great. The band is awesome. I think you’ll fit right in. Are you for real? I’m serious, bro. This is the big leagues. So, uh, you game? This isn’t a game, Allie. This is my life, okay? I think... I think Wes got a gig with that manager guy. Why are you laughing? Is my misery funny to you? No, no, no. It’s just you hate your partner, who happens to be from the same area as you, now you’re driving across the country and surrounded by Santa cosplayers? Okay, when you say it like that, I guess it is a little amusing in its ridiculousness. Ridiculous! Yes, yes. I can’t wait, bro. Well, listen, I gotta run, so I will email you some more deets, and we’ll chat later. Yeah, that sounds good. Looking forward. I am looking forward to seeing you soon. And so is Baby Comet. I love you. Bye. Bye. ♪ Ooh ♪ Tick tock tick It’s comin' up quick ♪ ♪ Yeah, Santa Claus is on his way ♪ ♪ Hauling lots of toys for the girls and boys ♪ ♪ Oh his trusty Christmas sleigh ♪ ♪ Ooh, ooh, whee ♪ Christmas is comin' fast ♪ Want the rest of mine? No, thank you. Y’all here visiting for our Christmas nativity play? No, we’re just passing through for a bite. Well, I highly suggest getting some of our pumpkin pie. Homemade. It’s a can't-miss. We’ll take two slices. To go. No. Can we get a cup of milk? Thanks. I don’t want to turn Jesus away. I know, baby. I want him to stay at my inn. I know you do, and I am so glad you do, but you know what? You have a part to play. A very important part in the Christmas story. And if you don’t tell Mary and Joseph that there’s no room in the inn, Baby Jesus will never be born in that manger with all those sweet baby animals. You won’t get to sing your song. Remember, it’s just a play, honey. - Okay. - Okay. More coffee? Ow! Yes, please, and the check as well. - You ready to go? - Mm-hmm. Thanks so much. You know, I parked in the garage down the street. I didn’t know we were gonna stay. That’s fine. It’s just gonna take a second, then we’ll head out. Wait, Lindsey Scott wants to break the driving schedule? Come on. That kid was so cute. Don’t you wanna see what happens? Not really. I thought you wanted to drive through the night. Why don’t you be a little spontaneous, Wes Bailey? Man, you and this driving schedule. Why don’t you live a little? So Mary and Joseph stopped in Bethlehem at an inn. We have no room for you at the inn. But you can stay for coffee. So Joseph and Mary stayed in the stables with camels and sheep, and Mary gave birth to a son. In the hills, an angel appeared to the shepherds and said... Do not be afraid. I have good news. Today in Bethlehem, a savior has been born unto you. You will find the baby lying in a manger. ♪ Away in a manger ♪ No crib for a bed ♪ The little Lord Jes... - What? - What happened? It’s gonna be okay. ♪ Away in a manger ♪ No... ♪ Crib for a bed ♪ The little Lord Jesus ♪ Lay down his sweet head ♪ The stars in the sky ♪ Looked down where he lay ♪ The little Lord Jesus ♪ Asleep in the hay Way to save the kids' play. And to think I didn’t even want to come to this thing. If I hadn’t shown up, what would’ve happened? It’s a good thing the world has me. Okay, compliment ruined. Hi there. Sorry. My son has something he would like to say. Thank you very much for helping me with my song. Do you want one of Santa's cookies? Whoa! Santa's cookies? You know what, buddy? Maybe you should save those for Santa. And as for the song, my pleasure. Hey, we really loved your line about giving Mary and Joseph coffee. That was very funny. Really, though, thank you so much. You really saved the night. Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. Good job. - Driving schedule. - Driving schedule. All you had to do was park the car. How was I supposed to know it was gonna close? Well, there’s a huge sign right there, Wes! How did you miss that? Guess I was hungry. Okay, let’s just... Let's just get our stuff and go to a hotel. Sorry. We only have one room. We’ll take it. Okay, so we’re just gonna get up as soon as the garage opens, get on the road bright and early. Hopefully there won’t be too much traffic in Nashville. Of course. One bed. Well, I’ll take the floor. No, you have a bad back. I have a perfectly fine back, so I will take the floor. Don’t be ridiculous. I will take the floor. Okay. Appreciate that. Hello, Santa. Hello, son. Ho ho ho! We used to watch this every year on Christmas Eve. - Oh, really? - Mm-hmm. Except for we would have pecan pie, not pumpkin pie. Mmm. What about you? Nothing specific. My mom would make pumpkin pie. Sometimes my aunt would make pecan. There weren’t that many traditions. Oh. We had tons of traditions in our family. Every year, after we opened up our presents and go through our stockings, watch old home movies, my mom makes Christmas sandwiches. - Christmas sandwiches? - Mm-hmm. You know, you take the turkey and the stuffing and the cranberry, and you put it on a sandwich. - Sounds good. - It was pretty good. I mean, it’s kinda better than the meal itself. We’d always have a pot roast. Really? I thought you didn’t have any traditions. Had one. If we hurry, we can get back in time for Christmas Eve. Damn! What? There’s a bug in there! This place is disgusting! It’s just a bug! Relax! Oh, okay, relax? No! That is not the point! What if it crawled out onto the floor? I don’t see anything. Well, I can’t sleep on the floor with that thing on the loose. So now my back’s not an issue for you? No, wait. I have an idea. Okay. Don’t worry about me. I’ll get the lights. It’s a chocolate almond. ♪♪- Ah! - I love his song. - Oh, so good. Me too. Hey, have you heard the live recording from Radio City Music Hall? What? That’s my fave! Okay, you gotta play it from my phone. - Hold on, you have it? - Yeah. ♪ And underneath the mistletoe ♪ Ooh! What’s this? This is actually pretty good. You write this? It’s just something that I’ve been working on. This is you. You composed this. Don’t sound so surprised. I’ve just been playing around with it, trying to write my own stuff. Well, you should keep doing it. You write lyrics too? I mean, I try to. Nothing really that good, so I just wind up throwing '’em away. Gotta take some pressure off yourself, Lindsey. What do you mean? I mean you’re always so perfect all the time. Art’s not supposed to be perfect. It just has to be truthful. Yeah, I guess. Wow. This is way better than anything I got. I can’t sit still long enough to focus on anything. Do you wanna be a songwriter? I don’t know. Maybe. I just don’t know if I have the discipline to even try. And as much as I hate to admit it, this is actually really good. Thanks. Okay, we have to stop at my favorite Nashville cafe. ♪ I got a cold beer in my hand ♪ I used to eat here every time I had a gig. It’ll take two seconds, I swear. Wes? Mark? What are you doing here? What are you doing here? Yeah! I cannot tell you how glad I am to see you. You hear that? Told you people love me. By the way, this is Lindsey. I’m sorry. I am so rude. Lindsey. Man, this is like a Christmas miracle. I’m playing with Cassie, right? Her keyboardist just came down with the ox flu. Ox flu? It’s really going around. Her backup’s all the way in London. He can’t be here till tomorrow night. Wes, you gotta do it! We’ve been scrambling to find someone, and you’re perfect. Man, I cannot believe that you’re here. Listen, Mark, I appreciate that, but we’re on a tight schedule, and we’re already half a day behind. - Plus, I don’t know her songs. - We can go over that right now. Besides, you’re one of the best improvisers I know. You’ll do fine. We’ll get your hotel room. - Food’s comp. It's good. - Oh! It’s the Grand Music Hall. Wait, wait, wait. Grand Music Hall? With the one and only Cassie? You gotta do it. - Yeah? - Yes. Doing it. Yes! Dude, thank you! I get a backstage pass though, right? Okay, this is the Grand Music Hall, where she’s gonna be performing. That is her crew setting up the drums and the bass. Here we have the background singers mics. And this is me in front of her stage. Okay, this is so exciting! - This is her piano... - Oh, wow. which I think I’m gonna sit at really quickly, Okay, those guys are leaving. So Wes just knew a guy? Yeah. He was like an old buddy of his or something. That’s so serendipitous. So why aren’t you playing again? You know all her songs. I told you it’s one of his friends. See, honey, this is why networking is so important. Did you read that article I sent you? Yes, Mom, I read the article. And I network. But Wes is just more connected than I am. I don’t know he does it. Oh, the baby just kicked. I think the baby likes you playing. Oh. Play us a song, Linds. This is your chance to play the Grand Music Hall. Okay, just one. This is for Baby Prancer. - Oh. - 'Kay. ♪ Up on a housetop, reindeer paws ♪ ♪ Out jumps good ol' Santa Claus ♪ ♪ Down through the chimney with lots of toys ♪ ♪ All for the little ones, Christmas joys ♪ ♪ Ho ho ho Who wouldn’t go ♪ ♪ Ho ho ho Who wouldn’t go ♪ ♪ Up on a housetop Click, click, click ♪ ♪ Down through the chimney with good Saint Nick ♪ Well, that’s not your impression of me, is it?

Well, you’ve got a nice set of pipes, don’t you? I don’t know. Well, I didn’t just fall off the turnip truck, honey. I know a good voice when I hear one. So Mark over there was telling me that this guy Wes was a great piano player. I think you could rival him, and you got the voice on top of it. I can’t believe you're saying this to me right now. Just say thank you, dear. Thank you. It’s okay. Here, sit. So, uh, you’ve listened to all my Christmas albums, huh? Yeah. Every year since I can remember. Hmm. Wouldn’t you know it? One of my background singers woke up with a little tickle in her throat. And I mean I don’t want her to get the full-on ox flu, do I? No. Why don’t you take her place this evening? What? Well, you said you know all my songs. Yes, but, I’ve never sung them in front of a crowd before. Oh, honey, if ifs and buts were candy and nuts, it’d be Christmas every day. No excuses, huh? Just say yes. - Yes? - Great! I don’t have anything to wear. Oh, I’ve got plenty to share. You will be living high on the hog tonight, girl. Well, come on. Wow. - How you doin'? - Let's get this going. - All right. - All right. - Hey, how are ya? - All right. Hi. Lindsey. You look... different. Well, I hope so.

You bet. Hey, um, would you wanna stay up a bit and grab a drink? I just sang with Cassie at the Grand Music Hall. I couldn’t go to sleep if I tried. Come on. - So I show up. - Yeah. It’s my very first gig. I’m so excited. I don’t even care that I have to dress up like a princess or whatever character they need me to be, you know. I’m getting paid to sing. It’s the best feeling. - Best feeling ever? - Ever. So I get there, and I find the manager, and she gives me my costume, and I open up the bag, and I’m the villain character. - No! - Yes! Which is like the worst thing you could possibly be at a kid’s birthday party. So all the kids are like booing and crying. Aw. That didn’t scar you for life from this horrible industry? No, actually. I mean, I got paid to sing, so I was pretty happy. So did you major in music? No, no, I didn’t. Actually, I got a football scholarship. - Hmm. Football, huh? - Yeah. And then before our first game, during practice, I slipped, I fell, and I busted myself. I had to have back surgery, and my career was over before it even began. So I moved to New Orleans. All of a sudden this, this hobby was now my career, my everything. Wow, you’re kinda like a fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants kinda guy, huh? Am I? Well, I mean, compared to me. You know, I like things kind of more calculated. - Like scheduled. - Schedules. - Not sure if you know that about me. - Driving schedule. Yeah. I’d love a driving schedule. Yeah, I get that from my dad. But he passed away when I was in high school. - I’m sorry. - Yeah, it’s weird. It’s like if I don't have some sort of structure, I can’t thrive. If I look around, and there’s no ladder, I just... I don’t know where to go. Yeah, see, I almost feel like there’s almost too many ladders. Too many ladders? I’ll start climbing one ladder, and then I get distracted, and then I start climbing another ladder, then another ladder and another ladder. It’s like all I'm really doing is climbing first rung of each ladder, not really going anywhere. This business is so hard. At least you know what you want right? But as much as I think it’s so nice to be able to play music for somebody else, how cool would it be to see my own name up on the marquee? Hmm. I feel like I’ve never talked to you before. You know, like really talk to you. It’s kinda nice. Yeah. Okay, well, this is me. Good night.

Can’t stop talking about it. Really? Well, listen, I’m gonna let you go. Okay, well, let me know if you need anything else. Of course, brother. Later. So, um... Congratulations. You heard him?

Wes, it’s okay. We’re just driving to Ohio together. You don’t owe me any explanation. Oh. Looks like winter storm Megan’s on the way. I’ll throw this stuff away. - Lindsey. - Hmm? I think the road’s blocked off ahead. I can’t see anything in this snow. Think I gotta pull over. Okay, turn your hazards on. Oh! - You okay? - Yeah. I think we’re stuck. Great. When do you think you’re gonna get somebody out here? Hello? Hello? Ohh! The phone is dead. Ugh! Will you try the engine again, please? I’m telling you it’s not starting. We keep doing this, we’re just gonna drain the battery. I’m starving. Oh! We got jerky. Jelly beans. Two reds and a green. - How did you know that? - Psychic. And I think that was the only combination left. Well, I’m still impressed. I know. It’s getting very cold. But you know what? In 24 hours or less, we will probably, hopefully be home. - I hope so. - I know. So why do you wanna get home so bad anyway? My mom. Your mom? We’ve been in this car for three days, and you haven’t talked to her or even said one word about her. She’s sick. Oh. And it’s been affecting her memory lately. I am so sorry, Wes. I am such a jerk. No, no, no. How would you have known? It’s okay. It’s just that it's been kind of hard to talk about, you know? Lately, she’s been getting more and more forgetful. Sometimes she gets confused about who I am, which is tough, you know, when it’s your mom. So my Aunt Maggie called last week and said that she was starting to get even more forgetful, so they started her on a new treatment. I’m just worried that... that she’s not gonna remember any of our favorite Christmas traditions, even if I make her favorite gingerbread or... make her pot roast, sing her favorite hymn, she’s not gonna remember, it’s not gonna mean anything. Well, it’s not too late. We’re gonna get you home. Yeah. I’m gonna get you to Ohio if it means we have to walk in this snowstorm. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold still, hold still. - What are you doing? - Hold still. Is something on my face? Make a wish. Mm-hmm. Mm. So what’s her favorite hymn? - Hmm? - Your mom. You said she has a favorite hymn. "In the Bleak Midwinter." I think I know that one. Like, ♪ In the bleak midwinter Something like that? That was one of the first songs I ever learned on piano. Brought so much joy to my mom and me. You know... last night, when you were playing for Cassie, I could totally see that joy that you were talking about. It’s just amazing to watch. I can never do what you did. What are you talking about? You can and you did. You sung with her. That was just backup vocals. I mean, you didn’t even know those songs, and you just got up there and played. It was amazing. If they would ask me to do that, I, 100%, would have said no. I mean, I’m not that good. Yeah, you are. No, I’m not that brave. I mean, watching you last night, you’re fearless, you know? And it’s so fun to watch. I don’t know. I just... I feel like I don’t have the same passion that you have. And my career has no progress. I think I’m gonna stay in Ohio. - Come on, what? - Yeah. I mean, it’d be kind of nice to stay close to my family and work with my mom in the shop. What, and just abandon your music? What am I abandoning? I can’t even write lyrics to songs. I think I’ve grown stale, and the audience can tell. That is so untrue. You’re the heart of show, Lindsey. I’m telling you, they might laugh harder at me, but it’s your voice, it’s your sentiments they resonate with. I’m telling you, I’m just the comic relief. Maybe the levity does make the sincerity shine brighter. I think so, and I think we make a pretty good team. Yeah, but you’re leaving. Just don’t you dare give up. - Wes. - Hmm? - Wes. - Hmm? - Someone’s outside. - Huh? Well, we’re headed to Cincinnati. Can I drop you off someplace? Um, a rental car place? There’s actually no rental cars available, but there is a bus that goes from Cincinnati to Akron. Leaves at 3 p.m. and gets in a midnight. Bus station, it is. Hop in. All right. - Welcome! - Welcome! Well, hello! Thank you so, so much for picking us up. It’s really so sweet of you guys. I’m Wes, and this is Lindsey. It’s a pleasure to have you. By the way, I... I love your outfits. Are you guys like actors? Oh, no, no, sweetheart. We’re carolers. We’ve been driving all over the area, spreading cheer at children's hospitals and schools. Well, Sister Catherine has been driving us. We only have one more stop before we head to the convent for Christmas Eve service. Lots to do. The convent. Oh, of course. - We’re from Our Lady of Grace. - You’re nuns! Well, if I’m not a nun, I sure did make a lot of vows. Hey! We do need to make one more stop before we get to Cincinnati, if that’s okay. Yeah, I mean, our bus leaves at 3:00, so as long as we’re back by then, it should be fine. Wonderful! Now, you two don’t, by any chance, like to sing, do you?

We got Monica! Monica, you can be whatever you want to be when you grow up because you are strong and smart and brave. You really think so? Mm-hmm!

You know, I keep telling her that. We should do that when we get home. A concert to raise some money, then we go and visit and sing with the kids. You’re going on tour. Yeah, but after. Yeah, maybe. - Oh, my God. - What? My sister’s in labor. Shea’s ten days early. When did this happen? I don’t know. A baby? What a blessing. A Christmas miracle. Well, let’s get you kids home. Okay, so I have your address, and I promise to send you a Christmas card with all of my family on it. Oh, looking forward to it. And keep singing, my dear. Your voice is a beautiful gift. Use it. Thank you. I will. I think all of this was part of a larger plan. Think so? Shea’s something special. I can see it in your eyes. Your journey is just beginning. Okay, let’s get some bus tickets. Number 415 bus to Akron is now boarding outside. - Oh, here he is. - Okay. Hi. Can we get two tickets to Akron, please? Today? Let's see. We’ve got one seat left. Hmm? Uh, we’ll take it. Okay. Thank you. Leaves in 15 minutes. Gate B5. Thank you. Merry Christmas. Take it. No. I’m not gonna take it. - Take it. - I won’t. You have to go home to see your mom. Your sister’s in labor. The baby’s not gonna know that I wasn’t there. Neither is my mom. You don’t know that, Wes. Take it. No way. Look, there'll be another bus tomorrow. It’s gonna get you there after midnight, after Christmas. Yeah, well, maybe I’ll happen to come across another caravan of caroling nuns, who happen to be passing right through Akron. I won’t get on. Okay. Let me see if they got a standby ticket or something. Do you happen to have any standby tickets? Uh, no. Okay, can you maybe do me a favor and print out like a voided ticket? We don’t do that. Can I get a ticket for tomorrow? Okay, there you are. Ooh, you know what? I’m just gonna use the bathroom real fast. - Okay. - Will you save me a seat? - Sure. - Okay. That’s mine. Wes. What’s going on? Don’t get off. I knew it. There were no seats left. What are you gonna do? I’ll get home. I got a ticket for tomorrow. I’ll get back after Christmas. I wish you would let me switch with you. Promise me you’ll come back to New Orleans, and I’ll see you there. Are you gonna even be there if I come back? Good luck with everything. With the tour. You really deserve it. And keep in touch, okay? - Hello. - Wes, oh. Glad I caught you. Listen, just heard from Aaron. He’s asking that the whole band fly in earlier for rehearsal. And instead of LA, he liked everyone to come to his cabin in Colorado. It’s about a three-hour drive from Denver. Okay. And he’d like everyone to get there by tomorrow night for an early rehearsal on the 26th. Wow. Tomorrow night? Tomorrow’s Christmas Day. I haven’t even gotten home yet. I’m still here in Cincinnati. Oh, well, that’s even better. Look, do this. Fly out of Cincinnati, okay, take a taxi from the Denver Airport. Now, I’ll text you the address, and that'll give you more time for your costume fittings. My costumes? Look, I don’t know. He’s an artist. You know how they are, bro. Hey, Robby, I’m gonna have to call you back. All right, so if we’re keeping on the I-71, you’re saying, what, about four hours? - Yeah, pretty much. - Okay, thanks. Sure. Cassie. Wes? Oh, my gosh! What are you doing here? You know, our car got snowed in on the way in from Louisville. - Oh. - What are you guys doing here? I figured you’d already be up in New York by now. Oh, we got stuck in the same blizzard. I mean, we were trying to make it to the concert, but I mean, that ain’t happening. We’re just trying to get everybody home to their families for Christmas. Hey, where’s your friend? She got on the bus today. I’m catching the one tomorrow. There’s only one into Akron a day. Well, we’re heading to Cleveland. Hop in! What? - Come on! - Are you serious? Yeah! Come on! Hey, guys, look who I just picked up. Wes! Are you all okay if we make a quick pit stop in Akron and just drop him off to be with his family? - Yeah! - Let's go! Whoo! Mom, did I miss it? Oh, Linds! Oh, no, no, not yet. Why are you crying, Mom? I’m just so happy you're here, and we’re all together. You’re gonna make me cry. Sit down, sit down. I’m crocheting a stocking for the baby. Mom, it’s nearly midnight on Christmas Eve. My procrastination has become quite a tradition. And you know how I feel about tradition. All right, tell me everything. Well, it was supposed to be 15 hours, and it turned into four days, so it was pretty rough, but it was also pretty great. Maybe it’s not always the journey that matters, but rather who you take it with. Yeah, maybe. You know, I heard a doctor on TV once talk about how feelings of hate and love are both controlled by the same part of the brain. And as they say, sometimes love can be found in the least likely of places. Mom... What? I know what you’re getting at. And yes, it was completely different than what I expected, but he’s going on tour. And yet we connected in ways that I never had before and possibly never will again. But it’s just not that simple, okay? Okay, okay. But what if it is? Would you look at that? It’s just after midnight. Merry Christmas, everyone. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas.
