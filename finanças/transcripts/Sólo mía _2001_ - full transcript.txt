- Shut up! - Let me go! - It's all your fault. - Shut up! - You think you know us so well! - That's enough! Playing the happy mother but you don't fool me! Shut up! Are you scared? You tried to destroy our marriage! - Untie me! - I'll never allow it again! Watch out! Out of the way, please! Come on! Hurry, hurry! Clear the way! Look at me. Look at me. Do you know me? Do you know who I am? Don't worry. You'll live. Although... I don't want to be like you in any way. Have you ever tried... just once... to see my side? Well, now it's your turn. I smoke because I want to, okay? Okay? It's over. Over forever. And don't ever raise your voice to me again. Long live the happy couple! Long live the happy couple! Let's see a kiss! Let's see a kiss! Let's see a kiss! Let's see a kiss! His Master's Choice. One moment, please. Good morning. - Yes? - Mr. Garcia... - Ramos? - Garcia Ramos. Your name, please. Isidoro. Isidoro for Mr. Garcia Ramos. Okay. He hasn't arrived yet. Will you wait? Oh, dear. Your first day? I'll see you later. - Everything okay? - Fine, fine. And the presentation? - No problem. - Come in and tell me about it. Mr. Garcia Ramos is in a meeting. Never trust a creative person. Hello, how are you? My boy... You don't know how happy I am. The times I've prayed to God for a formal boy for my Angela. That boy's finally turned up. Smile please. That's fine. Be patient with her, she's a bit immature but... she's got good qualities. One more. Thank you. Come on now, stop crying. I can't help it. Don't worry. I'm the type that gets married for life. Give me a kiss. It's incredible. You meet the right person where you least expect it. Stroke my hair. Remember that first day? I bet you dreamt of the switchboard. - No, I didn't. - No? Confess! Know who I dreamt of? Isidoro? But that's me. Give the man a prize. Darling? How did you guess? - Look. Do you like it? - Very nice. The cot's coming tomorrow. Don't forget the money. What's this? In case it's a girl. Wouldn?t it be better to be sure first? I'd rather find out when it's born. So in the meantime, do we buy double of everything? Come on, I'd rather wait. Okay, but promise me, it'll be a boy. - Want to go to the cinema? - Okay. Angela, for God's sake! I'll stop, I promise. It's playing with the baby's health. I won't smoke anymore. Give me a kiss. That's not good for you. I love them. Oh, what a slat! Slut... not slat. Slut. That's going a bit far. She deserves it. Poor thing. If she'd stayed at home... This is really good. Better than ever. Have as much as you like. I made extra for your brother but he hasn't come. Don't encourage him, on top of it. He needs to lose weight. Don't exaggerate. It's good to have some fat in reserve. Look after yourself. You don't look well. She's right and you should leave work now. Why? I'm fine. You don't need to work. You should think about what's best - for the baby. - Everything's ready. I don't want to stay at home. I enjoy the office. Yes dear, I know, but if you get tired, the baby - gets tired too. - I like working. I'll stop when I feel tired. Pass the bread, please. I don't understand it. - What? - Your proponent attitude. - I don't understand. - I'll stop when I'm tired. - Very nice. - It wasn't like that. That's how it sounded. Your mother trying to help - and what a reply. - I only said what I thought. Do you think your attitude is reasonable? Is wanting to work so strange? In your condition, it is. You should be thinking of the baby. But there's still 4 months to go. That's no time at all. Don't exaggerate. Don't be irresponsible. - You're already mistreating the baby. - Joaquin, please. You're acting more like a spoilt child than a married woman. That's not true. It is. You treat this pregnancy like a joke. 'Me working is bad for the baby? Who cares?' That's not true. But if I feel okay, why should I stay at home? I thought we'd decided to start a family. - It doesn't seem that way. - Well, it is. What does another month's work matter? Priorities. That means first things first. Child, husband, family. So you decide everything? Get things straight. You're married now. That was what I wanted. My pajamas are not here. Okay, Miss office-worker, where are they? Don't shout. Working all day, the house - is a mess. - It's not my fault. No, it's mine! Maybe it would be a good idea for me to wash and clean after work. That might be better. And with the fortune you earn, we'd be laughing. I'm sorry. I want us to have the baby so much. You?ll be the best mother in the world. If you want to be with me, to walk through life, live each moment... I fell in love with you, my souls sings with happiness... TO THE BEST MOTHER IN THE WORLD At your side I'll find the reason for living. I'd like to thank Robert and his creative team, without whom we'd never have made it. Look at them. Every year they laugh louder. And him... He'll be promoted in no time. Mark my words. Next year he'll tell the jokes and the others will laugh. That's how it works. Really! I'm Andrea and the one holding the glass is my husband. Or is the glass holding him? I'm Angela. - My husband's... - I know. We were invited to your wedding but we were away. A boy or a girl? We don't mind. That sounds fine. Do you have any kids? A little monster of seven, and that's enough. We love them. If it were up to Joaquin, we'd have loads. Prizes or kids? Don't take any notice. These publicity people are crazy. Do you go to pre-natal classes? No, but I'd like to. I'll introduce you to an instructor friend of mine. - She's good and helped me a lot. - No, I'll find... It's no bother and I've already arranged to see her anyway. Look at those two. Hello. Wave to your wife. We're still here. Carry on, carry on, brown-nosing. Good God, they're like children. Good, breathing deeply, breathing. Very good. Relax a moment. - Everything okay? - Fine. Next time, could you bring - your husband? - I expect so. One of the reasons for these classes is to get both parents to participate. Yes, I know. Carry on. You're doing fine. Now we'll practice a new exercise. - See you. - Bye. - Bye, Angela. - See you. - Bye, Angela. See you next week. - Bye. I've said I'm sorry. The meeting went on longer. I couldn?t just rush off. You could have phoned to say you couldn?t come. They're new clients. It would have Looked bad just leaving. - And I didn't have the number. - But I gave you the card. It must be in my other jacket. - It was important to me. - So you said. We should both be involved in this. What's it got to do with a gym class? More than you think. I looked like a widow - waiting for you. - If you'd taken a taxi... I mean... I'm sorry, darling. It's been a bad day. Shall we go somewhere? See if there's anywhere you fancy. I'd rather stay at home. How can he say the logo's small. Is he blind or something? That's ridiculous. He approved it himself, and remember he said... Well, I remember. No, it was him who insisted on that type of letter. Totally sure. Will you get down! So now it's my fault. Incredible. Yes. Okay, call me when you know. All right. Are you stupid? You might have a fall. It was so dusty... What's the maid for? Why don't you think? Hello. Are you joking? How will we be on time with all those changes? Wait. Let's see. The 14th's impossible. The 15th's a holiday. Monday the 16th. We've no choice. Same to you. What's wrong? The campaign down the drain. Damn client! Don't get upset. Everything will work out. I'm sick of it. I work like hell and then this! Lie down and rest. I'll go and get dinner ready. What is it? I used it on the lamp. I only smoked one. I was on edge... Angela! Angela! Angela! Angela! Angela, darling, I'm sorry. I didn't know what I was doing. Forgive me, darling. Open the door, please! I didn't know what I... I know, darling. But the most important thing is knowing how to forgive. Your husband's a good man and knows he's done wrong. Forget it. Forgive and forget. Think of the future. The baby needs a father. You?ll see... In a few days you'll have forgotten all about it. - Hello. - Come on in. - Where's Angela? - In the lounge. I'm sorry. You're crazy... Sick... You're... Let me go. Come on. Let me go, Angela! Let me go, please. You're afraid. Let me go. What are you playing at? Punishing the naughty boy? What will you do? Burn me with a cigarette? Poke pins into me? What do you want? You're scared. What? You are. Stop it! You want to get your own back? Call the police! Report me... But untie me! That's how I've felt so many times. That whatever I did, nobody was going to help me. You feel completely helpless, and you don't know what to do. I don't know... what you hope to gain from this. Me neither. You're crazier than I thought. Out of your head. You're afraid. I'm thirsty. Bring me some water, it's hot. What? Can I have some water...? Please. The glasses are in the cupboard. The yellow ones I gave you for your birthday. You liked them a lot. Remember? Thanks. Easy now... Easy... The room's nice. And nicely - decorated. - Yes. And very light. Is that a sofa-bed? No, but it's alright for a nap. The boy can't have slept well there. I stayed. He had to work! How are you, dear? Shall I raise the bed? I just want to get this over with. Poor thing. They'll come any time now. Push! Push! No! Be quiet. Don't push. No! 'It is better' is not the same as just 'better'... I don't care what you think. I'm telling you... Right... Really? Me? The battery's low. I'll call you back. Martin's proposed me as new creative director. I'm going to call him. I love you. Easy now, easy. Give me Ramon. Let's take a look. Delivery room for you. At last! They're coming now. Thank you. - Are you all right? - Yes. It'll soon be over. Why hasn't Joaquin come back? Where's Joaquin? Call Joaquin... please. I won't let on I know. Yes, don't worry. - Get Joaquin. - Where's Joaquin? Where is he? Your aunt's gone for him. - Where's my husband? - Calm down, dear. I'll call you when I'm told. Where is he? - Wait here a moment, please. - Yes. - Joaquin! Call him! - He's coming. Joaquin! My husband! Where's my husband? Perfect, ciao. - What's up? - They've taken her. Goodness me. - Where is she? - In there. Don't go in. - Why not? - If you'd been here, this wouldn?t have happened. - You can't go in. - I'm her husband. She's very agitated. I'm afraid you can't go in. - But... - I'm sorry. Oh, goodness me... How is she? - Who does she look like? - Not her father. More like her mother. Sure it's yours? I didn't see the birth. And the name? - Anything but Enriqueta. - My name! Angela's a nice name. We'll have to think about it. Haven't you got one? I had one but it was for a boy. Didn't you know what it was? We wanted to wait until it was born. Girls are more loving... Better for their fathers. You?ll dote on her. - Look now. - Pass! Come on! - Why doesn't he go for it? - Now! Now! Why doesn't he go for it? We heard you from the street. - Can I play now? - Go on then. - How's the baby? - Sleeping. Now she won't want to sleep tonight. - When does this torture end? - Don't be a pain. We've brought a video so... Okay... fine. Hello! There, sweetheart, stay with daddy. They?ll be like zombies till after the match. Want to buy us an ice cream? You're on, my beauties. Do you study - or work? - Whatever - you prefer. - You! I prefer you! No way. This one's mine! Come on, liven up. Don't leave me on my own. Stop it! Can't you take a joke? What about the football? What about having a good time? Give her to me. There, there. You're too much. There, there. The door! We've got the kid that cries most in the world. She's a girl. But you can't shut it up. - So? - I suggest you get her used to not crying. How do I do that? Don't let her sleep during the day. So it's my fault? If instead of shopping with Andrea... You're too much. If you were both single, there wouldn?t be a man left alive... Don't exaggerate. I know what I mean. And the meeting I've got tomorrow... And to hell with me, no? Want do you want? Another row over who does what? I'm fed up with you only thinking of yourself. 'My job!' Do you think all I want in life is to have babies? I want to be useful for something other than raising the baby. You don't know A from B. I won't be belittled. I'm going to study, even if it means no sleep. You're useless with sleep... You and your antiquated ideas. And that's with only one child. What if we had more? I don't care what you say. Whatever, but shut that kid up! There, there, there. And it's 'anti'... Antiquated! Go to hell! Come on. The client says it's the jingle... - Alejandro, where's Joaquin? - In his office. Tell him to hurry. The client?s here. I'll call you later. Joaquin, we... Joaquin. Who's beautiful then? Come on. - Your mail. - Thanks. You gave me a fright! I didn't hear you. How come you're home so early? - The meeting was cancelled. - What happened? - Has the baby slept? - She's been awake all day. Perhaps I'll sleep tonight. Take a nap now. I'll call you when supper's ready. I'm not tired. - You're dead on your feet. - Leave me alone! Okay... What is it? - I'm going to shower. - No, let's talk. What's wrong? Are you stupid? You know things are bad at work. And your promotion? You know the responsibility involved? No, how would you know? I realize more than you think I do. Don't make me laugh! You don't trust me enough. Trust, my dear, has to be earn. Your job's the only thing you give a damn about... - Rubbish. - Not even the baby. - As it wasn't a boy... - Shut up! - You'd rather she was a boy. - You're delirious... It's true and you know it. You never show her affection, - you never buy her things... - That's enough! - Who's that? - The babysitter probably... Who? We're going to a musical, remember? What musical? The one you and Alejandro wanted to see. I don't care. I'm not interested. - Hi. - Hi. I'm not going to need you. - I turned down another job... - Yes, but... Wait a minute. I'll pay you anyway. - Have you gone mad? - For calling a babysitter? - We?ll have to go. - I don't want to now. Don't play the martyr. Tell her to come in. Alright, but I'm not going. Are you stupid or what? Stop treating me like an idiot! Then behave like a normal person. - I've read the letter... - What letter? The university. You opened my letter? You can't be serious about it. - Here... Sorry. - That's okay. - Now listen to me, I'm serious... - It was for me. You're not going to study anything. You don't have time. - Get used to the idea. - I'll do as I please! I'll do... You pig! Pig? I'm a pig? Is that what you think? I'm your husband. I'm your husband and you?ll respect me! Respect me! Respect me! You?ll learn to respect me! Do you understand? Respect me! Respect me! Please, Joaquin, don't hit me anymore! Respect me! Respect me! Watch out! I've got them! It seems like only yesterday... Time goes by so quickly. And what we went through! - Her father wanted a boy... - And what difference did it make? I haven't got any. Carmen! How nice to see you! Your son looks very nice. Angela! - Would you mind...? - No... you go... You knew I was here? Joaquin told Alejandro. I heard your message. What's happened? Angela... What is it? My God! Darling. - How's things with the car? - I'm behind. What about the music? I can't find what I want. There's a catalogue in my office... I may have to get it composed. I'm sure it was here. - What? - The demo for the perfume. - How's everything? - Same as usual. How was the musical? Nothing special. You choose the next one. How's Angela? She saw Andrea yesterday. Ask her. I have. Can I help you? I don't think so. Can I help you? Yes. Well? What are you doing? Doing? Come on, Joaquin. She's told Andrea everything. Is it that important? What do you think? Women exaggerate a lot. Angela?s face doesn't. Okay, I was uptight. It's this campaign. And... that wife of mine... - You don't understand. - What? It's not that bad. We've all let fly at some time. I swear I love her a lot. I wouldn?t... hurt her for anything in the world, but sometimes... Sort it out. Go to a specialist... A head doctor? If you don't end this situation, it will end with you. You're wanted. And you did it again... You convinced me again. Your attention, please. A toast to the happy couple. Angela and Joaquin, who are celebrating their anniversary. Let's hear it. A few words. Well... err... Angela and I would like to thank you for joining us on this special day. As you all know, sometimes you feel like throwing in the towel... - Several times a day. - Yes. That's when a couple has to be strong. And so... Thank you, Angela. Anymore going? To Angela. - To my sister. - To Angela. To Angela. I'd like to thank Joaquin for this key ring. A wonderful present. It?ll come in handy for the U.N.E.D. Unez? - What's that? - The Open University. And I'll have to attend classes... Good for you. Brainbox! My present is much smaller but I hope you look at it very often. Look, with a moon calendar. What'll happen at full moon? He?ll turn into a werewolf. That new car smell! Pay attention. I love the color! - The only one available. - I'm so pleased with it. Thank you. Well, be careful. There are a lot of maniacs loose. Is there an airbag? You?ll see with your first bump. I'm joking... - So, school, eh? - Yes. Once a week? You already know that. - Only once a week. Sure? - Yes. There are a lot of good-looking guys at university. And pretty girls at work. You know you're the only one for me. Sure? - What's that supposed to mean? - Forget it. - Are you jealous? - Me, jealous? - Of who? - Nobody? Of my new secretary? You've got a new secretary? Caught you out. What a jealous little thing she is! Parking gets worse. - There are the council spaces. - No, they take them back. - What? - They're not forever. After a few years they take them back! Pity to leave it out there all alone. It?ll get used to it. Is Marta staying with your mother tonight? - We didn't know when we'd get back. - Great. - I've eaten too much. - That's not all... Your brother gives it a go. He's like a sponge. Mum? Hello, how's the baby? Yes, we?ll pick her up tomorrow about ten. Everyone except you. A beautiful present. Yes. Right... big kiss. Bye. Stop it. - You're beautiful. - And you're drunk. No, I'm... horny. Wait, wait... What's up? I want to get all this off. Hurry up. Don't rush me. Why didn't she come? - Your mother didn't come. - Her back hurt. Really? I sometimes wonder if she likes me. - When shall we have another baby? - The one we've got... Marta's lonely. - Don't you want another? - Yes, but not now. - Why not? - One is enough at the moment. - You always wanted lots. - Too much work. - How long do you want to wait? - I don't know. Angela, don't be like that. You don't give up, do you? - Always in a hurry. - You're lovely. Wait in the bedroom. What a pair of hams... Joaquin, wait a minute. Wait, wait, please, just a minute. - Why are you pushing me away? - I'm not. Don't be silly. Don't you want to? What...? We hardly do it any more and you don't seem to care. - You could go forever without it. - Please... I know I don't attract you sexually. Why not? - Please, don't tonight... Okay? - Yes, tonight. - Tell me why you don't want me. - Stop it. Why don't you want to make love to me? I love you, I want you. Don't push me away. - Joaquin, please! - You're mine. Love me! Let me go! Where are they? Where are they? - I know they're here! - No, please... - Where are they? - Joaquin, no! Joaquin, no! Where are they? Look what I'm going to do with your pills! Look what I'm doing! I'm good to you, I buy you a car, and you humiliate me! Why do you treat me so badly? I love you, darling. I love you, Angela. Why don't you love me? No, leave me alone! No, no, Joaquin, please! Why don't you love me, Angela? Stop, please! - Stop! Stop! - I love you, Angela. Love me back. What are you looking at? Where are you going? What are you doing? What are you doing? What? What are you doing? What are you looking for? Angela! Angela, what are you doing? Angela! No! What are you doing? Please! What are you doing? Angela, let me go! Angela, please! Angela, please! What are you doing? What are you doing? What...? What are you going to do? Angela, please! No, Angela, please! Please! Angela, forgive me, forgive me! Forgive me! Please, no! Forgive me! Angela, please don't! Angela! Please, forgive me! Forgive me! Forgive me! Please, forgive me! Forgive me! Forgive me! How are you? I feel faint. Come and sit down. - Do you want some water? - No... I feel... sort of sick. Well, what happened? My God! What are you going to do? I don't know. My head's spinning, I can't think. You can't have this baby. You have to concentrate on freeing yourself from Joaquin. But... It's my baby... The baby's mine... His too. Don't forget that. When he finds out, will he leave you alone? He?ll make your life impossible until you go back to him. Tell me... what I've done wrong. Look at me. I'm going to get angry with you. There's only one guilty person here. - Is that clear? Answer me. - Yes. Why live with no dignity? You're young. Nobody can rob you of your life. It's your life. It's just that... I'm... I'm afraid! I know, darling, I know. You?ll get over it. But whatever you do, don't ever tell him you got pregnant. Never. Right. - Where's Angela? - Get lost. - Where is she? - I said get lost! - Why have I had this? - What do you think? - I don't want a separation. - Shame. Now go! I need to see Angela. Only a minute. I have a right to see her. - She doesn't want to see you. - Liar! - Angela, nothing's going to happen. - Don't let him in, please! - Are you deaf? - Only a minute. Now calm down. - We can sort things out. - You can't. Understand? You've gone too far. - I want to see her. - Get out of here! I have to! He won't come in. - Angela! - Shut up! - Angela, I love you! - Shut up, damn you! No, no, he?ll kill me! Forgive me! I'll change! - He?ll kill me! - No, Ramon's there. - He?ll kill me! - He won't touch you. Angela, we have to talk. Ramon, make him go! Angela, I love you! I'll do whatever you say! - I can't live without you! - Move! - Let's go home, Angela! - Move! Come back and I'll smash your face in. Did he ever attack you in front of the child? Sometimes but... - she was so small that... - How small? Six or seven months... I don't remember. How much does your husband earn? Here's a copy of a pay slip. I'll need receipts of his expenses... Trips, credit card balances... Anything. I... You see... Yes? I'd like... I don't want it known that he mistreated me. You don't want it known? No. My daughter's very small and... I don't want her to hate him. And it might affect her if she found out. That'll go against you. I know. You?ll think I'm silly... Though your decision shows sensitivity, it's not very practical. But I'll respect your wishes. And... Well... I don't... ...want him to see my daughter. We can try, but judges rarely deny parents the right to visits. - In this case... - Only in serious cases, and this, I assure you, is not. Your child has never been in danger from him. Do you confirm - all the points? - We confirm the provisional measures requested, - and present our case. - How does the accused - plead? - We oppose the suit as there is no cause for separation. We therefore request that the measures asked for are not adopted as, contrary to the claims made, both parties continue residing together, their relationship is excellent, and to grant the plaintiff's request would be tantamount to defrauding the law, the main victim being the child, whose interests, as all present know, come first. You're useless! Are you stupid? Your head's empty. I was on edge... Respect me, understand! Respect me! Respect me! Regarding visiting rights, we oppose any limitations as the relationship between father and child is excellent and the plaintiff cannot prove otherwise. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Well? - How did it go? Happy? You took me for everything. I only want what's mine. No-one would think so. Ask the judge about that. Was not seeing the baby her idea too? With that bloodhound defending you, I'm sure you?ll get your own way. This is a war and you started it. Look, Joaquin, you're not well and Marta's very young. Marta's my daughter. And mine. Don't try it, Angela. I could make your life very difficult. In accordance with Article 103 of the Civil Code, the following measures shall be adopted. The tutela of the minor, Marta Garcia Martin, will be exercised jointly by both parents. The custody of the child will correspond to the mother. The use of the family home will be for the wife. The father may see the child on alternate weekends. Half of the minor's school holidays will correspond to each parent. As maintenance, the husband will pay the sum of 80,000 pesetas monthly. This amount will be paid to the wife within the first 5 days of each month. No pronouncement will be made on the administration of the joint assets, as the judge is not in possession of any inventory. No resort can be made against this ruling, although either party can oppose during the legal time. Signed, by the Judge. End. Let's see if he gets it into his head! - He'd better not come near you. - And you start living again. Go out with your friends or us. No moping around at home. And here the new items. See what I said about the colors? - Berta? - Yes? Put this away. No, wait. Let's see. I like it. It looks good on you. Sold. No, don't bother... I'll be bothered if you don't take it. Take orders, you work for me now. Come on. Busy? Come in. What are you doing? Trying to finish this. I'm sick of it. What you missed yesterday! We went to a party. You should?ve seen the material. What material? Some incredible chicks. Oh, that... Pepe ended up with a blonde. What melons! - And you? - Mine was a redhead. She looked like that girl on T.V... She's famous... I don't watch much T.V. It turned out they were pro's. Seemed too good to be true. - You should have asked. - It's not that easy. Anyway, we've made a date for tonight and I told them about you, and they're going to bring a friend along. - A friend? - I'm not sure if she was there, but she was fantastic. And another thing... If there's three of us, we get a special price. That's good... Look... By the way, do I... Do I look like a whore lover? You heard. Do I look like a whore lover? - Fuck... - Yeah, fuck... Don't involve me in your shit. - Don't be like that. - You're pigs. You're all married but cheat on your wives. Don't get so uptight. If you go with slags, why get married? Hypocrites! - That's enough! - Go on. Get out. And tell that lot to spend more time with their children. I'm not surprised your wife left you. - I'll smash your face in! - That's enough! You, get out! You're an idiot! Don't mention my wife again! Have you gone crazy? Degenerates, that's what they are! You're in no position to say that. I know them... Bunch of no-good liars. You never used to be like this. Or did you? I don't need a psychiatrist, so leave me alone. Your wife's suffering and you're doing nothing. She spends all her time conspiring with your wife. Hey, do you think they're getting it on. Though you'd be the last to know. I don't know... - What size is he? -50. Just a minute. Hello. - What do you want? - You know. Joaquin, please... I can't stop thinking of you as my wife... The only one I love. This can't go on. You can't keep following me everywhere. Let's try again. Joaquin, please! We've only just separated. That means nothing. It means everything. We have a child in common but that's all. That's not true. We're in love. What? I know I've behaved like a pig, but we must try again. There are a lot of couples that try again. What's important is that love's still there. Love? Life with you was hell. You've humiliated me... And you come here and say all this! Don't you see? I can't get used to being without you. I want us to live together, I want to spoil you... - Don't touch me! - Get out of here! - That's all we need! - Now! Darling... Call the police. Go on. It's over. Accept it. I'll see you again. Are you all right? Right then, back to work. NAME: ANGELA MARTIN MEDINA FILE NO - 83143- 2/26 COMPLAINT: HARASSMENT AT PLACE OF WORK It was my day. You said at 6, now it's 8. I couldn?t get here sooner. The plane was late. Couldn?t they wait? They didn't know if you were coming. Hello, I'm not in. Leave a message and I'll call you back. It was my turn to take Marta... She should have been with me and you took her. How could you? Why are you doing this? You?ll be sorry, you bitch. I'll smash you. I'll close your mouth forever! Bitch! We?ll see what happens. I hope they call us soon. - Excuse me. - Yes? Can I talk to you? Excuse me. It was urgent. I called your office and they said you were here. What's the matter? It's... It's... I can't take any more. He won't leave me alone. I have no life... What's he doing? He follows me, spies on me, rings me in the middle of the night. He causes a scene at work. And... yesterday... when I got home... Angela, calm down. Tell me what happened. If you'd heard the things he said... - Did you see him? - No. Here's the tape of his message. What do you want me to do? I don't know. But I can't go on like this. I'm going crazy... Angela, listen... Please, report him, do something, anything... I don't know. We could file a complaint for what he's said but... What would happen? Well... See you later. Well, he?ll go to court and if all goes well... Yes. Well? He'd be fined 15,000 or 20,000 pesetas. And that's it. That's all? For insults, no more than that. So it could get worse. It could get much worse. Next time call the police, or make a complaint. Right. And if I'm dead? Or how will I do that if my arms and legs are broken? What if he smashes my jaw? What sort of shitty justice is this? I don't make the laws. Enrique Valero San Juan! Excuse me, I have a case. - Hello, how are you? - Hi. Home time. I can't see Marta. Maria, where's Marta? Your husband picked her up. My husband? No. Yes, he said he had to take her. Where? Somewhere important he said. Is something wrong? Why did you let him? He's your husband... - Where was he going? - Somewhere important. - That's all he said. - He didn't say where? No, he picked her up and went. Everything was normal. - How long ago? - I don't know. About half an hour. - It was all so normal. - What shall we do? My baby! - I didn't know. - He must have said some place. - Do you want anything? - No. - A nice dessert? - No. Were there any yogurts? I'll buy some anyway. - Have you got the keys? - Yes, I have. Here they are. - Try and sleep. - I couldn?t. Well, lie down. I'll be back soon. You don't want anything? - Hello. - Hello. Now, now, Marta. We're here. Let's see mummy. Oh, Marta, darling! Sweetheart! Are you alright? - Are you? - She's just tired. - Why did you take her? - She's my daughter... - I wanted to be with her. - Are you mad? - You can't just take her like that! - And you can? - You take the weekend... - Stop accosting me... It's not fair! I only see her every 15 days. After the way you acted! There, there, Marta. Everything's all right, darling. Let's go to bed. Off to bed. What are you doing in here? Get out! This is my place. I bought it. - It isn't yours now. Get out! - Calm down. - I'll go when I want to. - Go! - Get out! - I said I'll go when I want to. You're sick. You're crazy... - For wanting to see her? - Don't come near her! - She's mine. - Don't touch her! I'll kiss her if I want! Put that phone down! - Get away! - Say you're sorry! Let me go! - Don't touch me! - Give me a kiss. You're repugnant! No, no, Joaquin, no! Please don't! You don't love me? Liar! Come here! Do what you want but just calm down! Come here, come here! - Don't hit me! - Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Good morning. Can I help you? Hey! ...and it's not only a question of reliability but also... Why do we have to talk...? - Mr. Garcia Ramos? - Yes? - You're under arrest. Come with us. - Turn round. Wait here. The next time it won't be 5 hours in jail. It was quite an experience. One day a judge sick of these cases might... - What? - Even send you to prison. Strike with care, that's the trick. It's a joke. Cases like yours are common. And you know the saddest part? There's no solution. The politician?s blame the judges, and the judges blame insufficient laws. And to top it all, society looks the other way. I'm afraid your case isn't one of the most serious. See those files? Some make your hair stand on end. What can I say? Having a daughter reduces your movements. Advice? Leave town. Don't let him find you. I'm sorry, Angela. I wish I could really help. Are you sure about this? Yes. I think it's crazy. I want to resolve this pacifically. Is it really the best way? I can't think of another. Why not just forget him? Don't worry. Everything will be alright. Shall I come up? Best if you don't. I'll wait then. No. I'll see you at the boutique tomorrow. Okay? Angela! Let me come too. Go. Got my number? - Hello. - Hello... Come in. Want a towel? You live here? For the moment. Till I buy something. How did you know...? They told me at the office. Come in. Do you want a drink? Water. Come in. Ice? No. I forgot. You don't like ice in water. Not if it's cold. What a surprise. I can't believe you're here. I needed to talk to you. I don't want a repeat of the other day. When you took Marta. She's my daughter. No, wait. Let me finish. None of this is her fault. I think we should... that we could... If you could change... Or at least try. Of course, Angela. Anything. You know how much - I love... - It's not so easy. I thought... that if you... That as you... It's not easy to say this. Yes? It's for you. Hello? Yes. Okay. Everything okay? Yes. What were you saying? I want you to sign a declaration. What sort of declaration? Wait... I've got it here. One: if anything happens to the baby or me, you will sign into a hospital for a year. You're kidding? Also if she or I suffer any kind of attack, all your assets will be frozen and given to her when she comes of age. You are joking. I, in exchange, will come back to you and continue as before. Really? If you respect us you don't have to worry. We?ll be a family again. Your idea or your friend's? It's for Marta's sake. I don't want her ending up on her own. She's got me. But she needs both of us. Are you serious about this? Do you think I'd have come if I wasn't? I'd like to believe it. How can I convince you? I don't know how... See? I still wear my wedding ring. I'd feel strange without mine. Then don't take it off. I'll never touch you again. We?ll do whatever you want. Only what you want. The main thing is being back together. - Get away from me! - What's wrong? I can't! - What is it? - Get away! You're so jumpy. What's...? Why? Who are we? You and I. Two strangers, That got married. And had a child. And what else? Nothing else. Then why did we get married? I loved you, although... I don't know what love is any more. Didn't you know how you were hurting me? Every time I hit you, I felt so wretched... I thought I should thank God for having you and all I did was... Treat me like an enemy. Forgive me. I don't like what I am. But I can't help it, I swear. I've often thought of shooting myself... You don't believe me? I even bought a gun. It's there, in that wooden box. Be careful, it's loaded. Would you really...? Would you have dared...? You're a child, Joaquin. Though they always said I was. Forgive me. Forgive me. At the moment, I can't trust you... It's best if Marta and I went away for a while. Get away till we felt better. Later on we could see. Why not now? We have to forget. And that takes time. You?ll take Marta. - Till we get over this. - Separate me from my daughter? Is that it? This is affecting her. Every time we fight... it's not fair on her. Fair? What about me? What's all this fairness. You're so cynical. If you'd acted like a normal person, we'd never have come to this. I won't let you take my daughter. I'm warning you, leave her out of this. More threats? She's our child... both of us. And I have legal rights. I have all the right in the world to protect her. Who is it? How do I know? Untie me! It's over. Untie me. What do you think I'll do? Open the door first, if you?ll feel better. Angela! Stop it! Good evening. Mr. Jaramillo's not answering the door. Is he here? Do you know if he's gone away? I don't know. We've brought this packet. We've come a long way. Would you mind giving it to him - when you see him? - No. What an odd woman! Let's go. Come on, come on... No! Let me go! Come on. It's your turn now. It's not very nice, is it? No! Please! You come here, and tell me a love story, and split my head open. What shall I do? It was true. Everything I said - was true. - Liar! Call the solicitor and he?ll tell you. Why? Why didn't you let me hold you? I disgust you, don't I? I repulse you and you can't come near. What did you expect? Love, understanding, after - all you've done? - Why did you come? Because I'm afraid! For the baby's sake, and that you?ll hurt her! My own daughter? I've never touched her! Not once! In a moment of madness I might use this on you or me, but never on Marta! Why? Joaquin? How did we come to this? I was in love. I wanted to be happy. You don't hit those you love... or insult them... or humiliate them. I'm sorry. Really. My God! - Andrea! - What are you doing here? What have you done? - What is this? - Let her go! Calm down, Andrea. - Put the gun down. - Mama Andrea - poking her nose in. - Leave her alone! Shut up, do you hear me? - You broke our marriage up! - Shut up! You think you know us so well. But you don't. You're a failure playing the happy mother but you don't fool me! You tried to destroy our marriage! I'm sick of you! I'll never allow it again! Out of the way, please! Come on! Hurry up! You're in a hurry. Come on. Did I hurt you? Play with your brother. But he's so small and you're so big. - They grow so fast. - Yes. I don't recognize my nephews when I see them. Let's see now... How are we today? Very good. - Are you going? - Yes, it's getting late. Your kids are beautiful. - It's my birthday. - Are you going to celebrate? We're going to the zoo and a party tomorrow. - Say goodbye to daddy. - Bye. Mind the lions! Hold my hand, darling. It?ll be great at the zoo. Mummy, will Carlos buy me a balloon? He?ll buy you one and I'll buy you one. Good, good, good! Only mine. From your mouth the pain, in my hands the flame that lights the eternal fire that burns me inside. The caress that touches, the hug that strangles, the soul of your soul is mine. Only mine. ONLY MINE Mine to love you, mine to feel you, mine to break you. You're mine, only mine. And nothing more. Only mine. Mine to love you, mine to feel you, mine to break you. You're mine, only mine. And nothing more. From my hands the pain, from your mouth the water, that puts out the eternal fire, that burns you inside. I haven't known how to love you, not your soul nor your belly, but without you I can't live and you will not live. Only mine. Mine to love you, mine to feel you, mine to break you, You're mine, only mine. And nothing more. Only mine. Mine to love you, mine to feel you, mine to break you. You're mine, only mine. And nothing more.
