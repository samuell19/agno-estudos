Distorted voice: Imagine a disease. Imagine a disease that lives in the air you breathe. In the air that everyone breathes, everywhere. Everywhere on the planet Earth. The disease infects your mind. It makes your mind want things. Things to own, things to consume. The more you own and consume, the more you want. You don't have to imagine this disease. It's all around you, inside you. Telling you lies, infecting your mind. These things harm you. Without a cure, they will kill you. I have a cure. The cure begins now. ( woman singing Greek hymn ) ? Never look her in the eye ? ? Never tell the truth ? If she knows you'll pay her ? ? You know she'll have to burn you ? ? Never tell the one you want ? ? That you do ? Save it for the deathbed ? ? When you know you kept her wanting you... ? ( cell phone ringing ) Know where I am? Yeah, I remember you. I'll see you outside. Okay. Hey, Stevie? You haven't been in my shaving kit, have you? Yeah, sure. Ha ha. What the hell is that? ( man groaning ) I don't know. Some kind of game. I clicked on a pop-up and I got this. Christ. You better get out of the house more often, pal. Whatever happened to hanging out on the street corner with your friends? What happened to stickball, for Christ's sakes? Staring at a freaking screen his whole freaking life. It ain't healthy. - No bacon, huh? - No bacon. Yeah, no bacon, no sausage, no home fries. Egg whites and melon. - Next weekend, pancakes. - What is this? Not even a whisper of butter on my toast. - We agreed, we're gonna get healthy. - Yeah, healthy. How you feeling? Never better. I got a cough. Thank God you gave up smoking. Yeah, thank God. Need any more mints or gum? No, thanks, I got mints coming out of my ears right now. Appreciate it. - ( spits ) - God damn you. God damn it. - You shaving with those? - Must have slipped into my bag. Yeah, then it must have slipped into your coffee. And don't look under the bed because the pack that was there must have slipped into the garbage. That's funny, Mary. That's really funny. Could you get me another cup of coffee, please? By the grace of God, you could be lying in a hospital bed, dying. We're changing our lives, Charlie. We're gonna exercise, we're gotta eat healthy. Oh, Christ, starve me to death, why don't you? Stevie: Oh, shit! - Mary: No more smokin'! - ( grunts ) Shame on us if we don't learn from this. - Throw out the Viagra as well. - ( cell phone ringing ) - ( sirens wailing ) - Christ. I'd just seen this on my kid's computer. You and two million other people. Motherfucker put it on the internet. - I don't like Stevie watching this crap. - Aw, shit. - Who is he? - Edward Maxwell, a big-shot CEO. Ran a company called Equivalum. - You call CITU? - Yeah. Man: Keep those reporters back. - This is some fuckin' rig. - Man: Fuckin' nuts, huh? Is that your official report? What's with the camera? It's a laptop PC connected to a G5 modem. - There. - What is that, cellular? Yeah, expensive. All the ID numbers have been filed off. - You unplug that thing? - Yeah, I unplugged it. - That's unplugged? - Yeah. - Locate the feed. - Can't find it. - Who's shotgun is this? - We're tracing it. Locate the feed. - Do your surveillance, Mick. - Mm-hmm. Every fuckin' angle, here. Sounds-- ( coughing ) Sounds good. You know what? You're right. Fuck seeing a doctor. You know better. Have CITU break down the hard drive of that thing. Just push forensics on it. Maybe we'll get a print. We'll get lucky. ( laughs, coughs ) - Just get me out of here now. - You all right? Yeah, just find out what his last days in the world were like and get a lead. Charlie: I'm in pain. Man on phone: Charlie, it's into your liver and into your bones. - You need to tell Mary. - Just give me something, will ya? Charlie, I've given you the highest doses of Oxycontin that I can. - Give me something more. - I can't give you any more. - This is a crock of shit. - It's not a crock of shit, it's morphine. If I give you any more, I've gotta put you in the hospital. Just give me something please to immobilize the pain so I can function. Come on, I can't have 57 guys standing around waiting for me to cough my lungs out so I can get through a sentence to tell 'em what has to be done. Are you gonna give me something or not? Let me put you in the hospital. After a few weeks in the hospital, I'm walking around with a morphine drip in one hand the other one shoved up my ass. Limping like a vomiting zombie adds up to one thing: Humiliation upon humiliation! And I'm not into it! Are we clear on that? I'm in pain, man. - I'm in real fucking pain. - Charlie, I love you. If you don't listen to me you're going to be dead in a couple weeks. - Are you doing this with me? Are you doing this with me? - No. No! - You're not doing it? - I'm not doing it. Fuck you! I'll find somebody else! - There is nobody else. - The hell there ain't! You think you're the only doctor on earth? You shyster ingrate fuck! You know how much business I brought you? You wouldn't be in Saddle River without me. You driving a BMW now? - Drive off a fuckin' cliff! - ( phone beeps ) You fuck. ( sighs ) Are you awake? Uh-huh. There's something I wanted to tell you. ( choir singing ) I took off early. I'm at the church now. So go home and I'll see you in a little bit. Bye-bye. ( pipe organ playing ) ( water splashing ) What are you doing in church? I'm here to pick you up. Something wrong with that? No, but it's like it happens every day, right? So what? - What's going on? - What's going on? - Yeah, what's going on? - Pop, you're everywhere. What are you talking about? Come on, you can't tell me you don't know what's going on. ( train rattling ) Charlie: I'm coming already. Relax, will ya? Your mother's down there having a fucking conniption. - Can we eat, please? - Dad, you gotta see this. - I want it off! - Mary: It's on the table! All right, but you're on the web, Dad. Yeah, look. You and Uncle Mickey. Look. What the hell? I could use some help, guys! What are you looking at? Charlie: How the hell'd they do that? Oh my God! ( sirens wailing ) Mickey: Remember Maxwell ran this company called Equivalum? - Yeah. - Well, Equivalum was web-jacked three days ago. Right. And a web-jack is what again? They steal their accounts off the internet. They disappear, bank accounts, - serial numbers, ID codes... - ( coughing ) phone lines, whole shebang-- gone, never existed. - I get it. - 40 divisions in 50 countries, the only way these people communicate is by pigeon. Now the CEO was murdered on the internet, the Dow is down 140 points because there's rumors that Equivalum's going under. What does the Dow have to do with doing the goddamn surveillance work? - Did you do the surveillance work like I said? - Yes! Did Petey run the numbers on the laptops and the cameras? - Chemically etched off, just like the modem. - There's no prints? - Not a thing. - The modem will give up something. - Just got to trace it. - No, it's stolen. There's no way to trace it! Fucking bullshit! A modem goes back to where it comes from. All right? Even I know that. The chip was made in Taiwan, 400,000 every year. Anyone could have bought it. - So this is her, right? - Yeah. Sorry it took so long to get back. Barbara Canosa, this is Detective Daines, the leading investigator in the case. Barbara was Maxwell's secretary. It's lovely to meet you. Thank you for coming down. Did he get you coffee? - I'm fine, thank you. - Good. This is pretty nasty stuff, hmm? Mr. Maxwell was a wonderful man. I know the society pages never showed that side of him, but he was. He treated us all like family. And his wife, what she saw-- What we all saw. ( gasps ) I'm sorry. Take your time. ( train rattling ) Barbara, you've been very helpful. Thank you for coming down here. I appreciate it. You want us to get you a cab? - No, my brother's waiting outside. - Thanks, we'll talk soon. - Thanks. Thank you. - Thank you again, Barbara. So whatever he was doing between 3:15 and 5:45 - is the big mystery around here. - That's it. Check the traffic lights, cameras, surveillance, - banks, warehouses-- - Been there, done that. We got Maxwell going to lunch and that's all. There he is going to lunch. Now the bad news, Byrnes wants a briefing at 10:00. I'm not feeling that great today. I feel fuckin' rotten. - Okay. - Run that thing back for me, will ya? Mm-hmm. ( jungle sound effects ) Distorted voice: Imagine a disease. Imagine a disease that lives in the air. In the air that everyone breathes, everywhere. Everywhere on the planet Earth. ( website continues playing ) Why aren't you up there? 'Cause I ain't feeling that good. Mickey's on top of it. Well you, you get on top of it. Because this thing's gonna blow up into some fuckin' mishkadense. My phone's ringing off the hook. The mayor, the chief, the papers, my friggin' ears hurt. My fuckin' sister in Ronkonkoma called me about it. Jesus, Charlie, this internet shit gives me nightmares. And don't even ask me about jurisdiction because I don't even fuckin' know. We got a murder that took place in Brooklyn, fine, that's us. But it's a crime to transmit those images over the internet. That means anywhere it was broadcast, local jurisdiction has a claim. Charlie: Good. Keep it with us, then. Fuckin' A, Charlie. Somebody dies in Buckingham Palace, I see it on the web, I ain't hoppin' the first fuckin' flight to London. Distorted voice: I have a cure. The cure begins now. - Okay? - That's it. Okay, we've all seen what happened after that. So, Captain Byrnes has convened specialists from several different agencies to assist in the investigation. Adam Sotrel's first up. Thank you. Good morning. I think we should get right to it. Unlike the virus, the worm requires no action from its victims to activate. They spread from system to system with relative ease. That's what we're dealing with. Let's have a look how the worm worked Phase one: entry. By successfully hacking into the Equivalum... - ( buzzing ) - ...the perpetrators enjoyed many of the same privileges as the system administrator. - Mickey: What a monster headache that was, huh? - ( coughing ) What's going on? You all right? God damn it, I got the flu. - I can't get rid of it. - See a doctor. That's why we call 'em doctors. ( train rattling ) Hey, Jane? Yeah, Detective Daines. Charlie. Charlie Daines. ( chuckles ) Yeah. How you doing? Good good good. I need you to do me a favor. ( Charlie coughing ) ( gasping ) - Hey. - Hey. - How've you been? - Good. - Good. - Are you all right? Yeah. - Did you get it? - Yeah. Oh, good. Thank God. Hey, you sure you don't want me to do that for you? No, I can do it. It's not like I haven't had the practice. ( laughs ) - How've you been? - Good. Yeah, you look good. Better than the last time I seen you. No tracks. 11 months, three days. Good girl. I'm sorry I asked you to do this. No no no. If not for you I'd be in Rikers right now. Ridiculous amount of pain to be in. How much do I owe ya? 100. Here, buy yourself something. - I can't take this-- - Go on, get outta here. What's going on with you anyway? Give me some good news. Well, I'm stripping four nights a week-- Christ's sakes, you call that good news? You might as well not have fuckin' known me. Not-- not totally naked. Just topless. No sex. - It's just dancing. - Oh, good. Plus, you get to be the first to know-- I signed up for my GED today. - That's great. - Yeah. I'm a little worried about it though. They want me to buy all these books. I'm gonna have to read 'em really fast too. I've gotta take a test in six weeks. - You're gonna do fine. - Yeah, I feel good. I feel like I'm finally getting a handle on things, you know? ( whispers ) You'll do fine. You're gonna do fine. ( woman singing Greek hymn ) ( coughing ) Charlie, that cough's getting worse. Maybe we should call Vinnie. Just leave Vinnie out of it. - I'm feeling fine. - I want a second opinion. Just put it to bed. ( continues coughing ) You didn't put my cigarettes in this, did you? It's a protein shake. Drink it. I enrolled us at a yoga class at the Y. We start a week from Saturday. That's great, honey. I don't need to join the Hare Krishna. All I want is a cigarette. Have a mint. Have a piece of gum. I hate mints and I hate gum and I hate-- "People who eat mints and chew gum." I know. - I'd lose my head if I wasn't attached to it. - Hey, where're you going? Charlie: Just a second. ( coughing ) - Charlie: Oh, Christ. - Stevie: Oh my God, that's sick! - You think that's a game? - What? - I don't know. - You don't know? Well now the fuck you know. Somebody just died! ( sirens wailing ) ( police radio chatter ) Charles Horvath. Another CEO, another big company. This is gonna make people crazy. You got any stocks? You better sell 'em now. - Go look for cameras. - Already doing it. No, other cameras. Hey Petey, pull the feed on that thing? Yeah. - Run the numbers on it for me, will ya? - You got it. How many people see this? Adam said two million, maybe more. They used the forced feed on the Equivalum site again, so... we're dealing with the same guy or group, whatever. Some fucking wacko, I don't know. Hey Charlie, you know, there could be a silver lining to all this. - What? - We crack this case, you're Holmes, I'm Dr. Watson. As opposed to who? Chico and Zeppo? I think you're out of your fucking mind sometimes. Holy shit. I want to look for cameras! ( siren blaring ) ( ship horn blowing ) Hey. How you doin'? - Are you okay? - Yeah. A little pain. How about you? Still shakin' down the coconuts? Here. Thank you, sweetie. Just what the doctor ordered. ( chuckles ) Hey, did you ever go for your permit? - No. - Why not? You gotta get out of here more, you know? Gotta get out. Whoever we're after has undoubtedly left an electronic footprint on a database somewhere around the world. Unfortunately, these databases are not integrated. And with the help of the Justice Department, I authored software to cross-reference them and look for suspicious patterns of behavior. Now, the antiglobalist network started in 1999 in Seattle, Washington. And then mushroomed into something larger and quite frankly more dangerous in Genoa 2001 when a protestor, Carlo Guiliani, was shot and killed by the police. Now after that, hundreds, maybe thousands of these violent splinter groups sprung up all over the world. And in my opinion, we're looking for one or more of these groups. Do we have files on all these groups? You got people working? Absolutely. Who's in New York, who's been to New York, who's coming to New York. Next thing we got do is look at the capabilities of these groups. And why can't this be one person? Sure, one-person part of a classic cellular terrorist organization. No, no organizations. One person operating alone. Then go with God, Detective Daines. I'm sorry, that's what I think it is. If you take that line of investigation, you're gonna end up wandering the desert for 40 days and 40 nights. ( laughs ) Right now I'm feeling like John the Baptist right before the fucking ax, pal, because I haven't a fucking clue as to what you just told me. ( laughing ) Aw, fuck it, don't mind me. NASDAQ and the Dow Jones took a big dip this morning which is obviously a direct consequence of what's been going on here. If you ask me, that points to an antiglobalist network. I've also put together what I believe to be a strong list of contenders. - How many? - 253. Two hundred fifty fuckin' three, holy shit. I know it sounds like a lot, but I can cut that in half in a couple days, so won't worry. How do you do that? Hackers, code writers and virus writers, they all share one thing in common. They all speak the same language. And even if you don't know how to speak that language, which I'm sure you don't, you still gotta know where hackers congregate in cyberspace. Well, right now I feel like I'm in cyberspace. ( chuckles ) Obviously, we don't speak that language. So you're the boss, pal. Continue. I can solicit information without losing cover. I think we should look at American organizations as the pathology tends to lean toward a patriotic bent, albeit extreme. Albeit. Got to love a guy who uses albeit. Right, Tommy? All right, Charlie. Get on with it, Adam. Go ahead. Charlie: Why are you turning this thing into rocket science? We've studied all the cases there is to study. The profile is white, male, under 40 and affluent besides-- Stop, Charlie. Stop! Let me make it real easy for you: what the kid wants he gets. That's great, Tommy. You know? The kid utters a couple three-syllable words, you drop your fuckin' pants and bend over for him. You know, when you run for office use him as a campaign manager. The groups, Charlie! Work the groups! You're a shanty Irish prick fuck, always were and always will be! Fuck you too! I'd like to take that shanty Irish prick, put him on the next boat to Belfast. - All right, take it easy. - I got to be denigrated in public by this little web-headed fuck? ( coughing ) Take it easy, Charlie. Come on, easy. What are you looking at? Go back to your exercises. You got a problem with a man coughing? Come on. And lose some weight, you fat fuck. Hey. ( gasping ) You coming in? Yeah. Are you okay? Yeah. Two pops in one day ain't good, Charlie. You're gonna get a jones. No way. - You want a habit? - No way. So what's going on? I'm dying. ( laughs ) What? I'm dying. Doctor told me that. Imagine that. ( chuckles ) No fucking dairy. What the fuck do they know? Dying. Charlie... is there anything that you want from me? Anything. Three things I got right... my whole life: My wife, my kid... and my work. That's my Holy Trinity. I'm not losing that. ( Charlie coughing ) ( coughing continues ) - Hey. - Hey. You all right? Yeah, a little tired. And now I'm late. Same old, right? - Catch you later, Mickey. - Mm-hmm. ( sirens wailing ) Oh God, what's this? Flat, it's the latest thing. That's what the guy told me anyway. Dad, look, about before... I'm sorry. I felt like a real idiot afterwards, but... you've got to understand, my friends are online all the time. It's-- it's kinda like what we do, you know? What do you want to do with your life? We always talked about, you know, following in your footsteps. No, don't. Don't settle for what I do. - You think I'm not good enough? - Oh, come on. Can't you see what all these years of wading through this shit has done to me? You're watching crazies on the computer all day long, I'm chasing them down the street. What the hell is the difference? There's good people in the world, you know. Beautiful people. You're not gonna find them chasing the pension. That's all I did. For 30 years. Chasing the pension. You know, smell the ocean. Get that thing inside before your mother finds out what I spent on it. Everything all right? Yeah. Everything is beautiful. You get Stevie's new monitor? Mm-hmm. Did you get the bad guy? Working on it. ( Charlie breathing heavily ) Charlie? - You're up early. - Yeah. Know what I've been thinking about? ( wheezes ) What? Go to Acapulco, just me and you. Yeah. We'll bring Stevie. No, just the two of us. Stevie can stay with my brother when he comes back. - What do you think? - Acapulco... Acapulco was great. ( woman singing Greek hymn ) ( glass shatters ) ( phone ringing ) Yeah? Yeah. We think it's the pier on Coney Island. Get Carson over on those piers now! Call the Port Authority, find out who made that ladder, where it was distributed. Will you talk to me, Adam, please for Christ's sakes? Will you talk to me?! The image is coming in from a cell phone. I think it's a G5. Will you just get me a location before the poor man drowns? - I'm working on it. - Before he drowns! I'm working on it. Man: Still don't have anything. No! God damn it! ( sirens wailing ) ( Charlie coughing ) When are you going to go see a doctor? You're like a kid with a toothache who won't go to the dentist. Satellites, huh? Cellular cameras? CITU say something about that? Adam said the signal bounced all over the world. Went up and down through leased time and two, three satellite uplinks. Signals got to end up somewhere, though, right? E-mail accounts. Six different countries, untraceable. - His profile list said what? - 107 groups. - 107 groups? - You want to give the guy a break? It's down from 253. - The feds gave him clearance, right? - Mm-hmm. Carnivore, whatever the fuck it is. What's he doing with that? Running warrants, chasing e-mails, internet activity. - That's good. - Let the kid run with this. He understands this shit. - You're a dinosaur, Charlie. - Whatever. Hey, Enrique! ( Charlie coughing ) Thanks, buddy. - Hey, Harwell. - Yep? Have you seen Daines? ( grunting ) He's not upstairs? No, and it's important. I think we got a break. - On the profile list? - Yeah, Thadeus Moore. On the morning of the Maxwell killing, he paid for a gypsy cab on his credit card. The fare originated about half a mile from the warehouse where the body was found. And the timeline also fits. So two years ago, Moore was arraigned for the Fungi virus which didn't stick, but he's still got ties with the Black Guard. He was arrested in Seattle in '99 and Genoa in 2001. But this is where I get really excited, because eight years ago, the guy was arrested for publicly claiming he was going to commit suicide online. I know, it would have been nice, right? But somebody in his inner circle gave him up, otherwise I'm pretty sure he would have succeeded. Some world we're living in, huh? - I gotta shower. - All right. Where in the fuck is your partner? I told you. He had to go to the doctor. Did you hear the cough on him? The guy's dying. Give him a break. I'd like to give him a break right across his fucking head. All right, what about Moore? Adam says this is a good thing. Yeah, okay. But find your fuckin' partner. - Thanks for stopping by. - Sure. - How you been? - Okay. Good. Sit down. I appreciate this. I hope you're hungry. I probably shouldn't take a lunch today. It's been crazy at the office. ( coughing ) I suppose you heard about these other homicides. - Waitress: What can I get you? - Sorry, we're not gonna eat today. - You want a cappuccino or something? - Iced tea, please. Thank you. There's just a couple of things that, I don't know, seem a little inconsistent in terms of what you said. I just wanted to go over those. You know how West Street runs north and south, and then you got Chambers and you got Liberty, right? Yeah. On a surveillance tape on that particular day, maybe it's Murphy's Law, your boss took a left out of the building and went down to Liberty. And I just wondered if there's anything in the Liberty area that could have occupied him for so long. I mean... you said he was down there for over an hour and a half. And, I don't know. I-- I don't know. There was something that might have piqued his curiosity. Maybe we could just cut to the chase, so to speak. He goes to a shop sometimes. What kind of shop? Happy Bob's. ( laughing ) He goes to Happy Bob's? ( laughing ) ( sirens wailing, horns honking ) ( police radio chatter ) That's it. Today's the day I strangle my partner. You got something? Yeah, I'm tracking his passwords and login names. Before 9/11 there's no way we'd have got authorization to do this. Piece of shit like Thadeus Moore, he'd have been protected by the liberal agenda of the ACLU. Mickey: What did people like this do before the internet? That's what I'd like to know. What's this maniac doing? He's checking his stocks now? He's making a fortune and he's shorting everything. - What's that mean? - He's betting on the market going down. - So this son of a bitch is making millions? - If I'm reading this right. This all started a couple of hours before the Equivalum web-jacking. Holy shit. It's all been about making money. This is our guy, isn't it? If it isn't, he's either psychic or he's got the best broker in the history of finance. What do you want to do? I gotta call Byrnes. ( dialing ) This is a homicide investigation. You want me to take you in? Now the last time Mr. Maxwell was in here did you see anything out of the ordinary? - Like what? - I don't know. Did he talk to anyone? Did he solicit anyone? Was he waiting here for somebody? Was somebody waiting for him? I remember he sat in usual seat and watched. And he doesn't talk or associate with any of these girls? No talk, no touch. Just put money for girls on bar. Look, this guy never gave no trouble. I'm sorry he's dead. Hell of a way to go. Came usual way, he left usual way. What is the usual way around here? He was important man. He use back door. So, there's an alley out here? - Yeah, sure there's alley. - Who lets him out? - I let him out. - Was there anyone in the alley that afternoon? He stop and talk to someone around corner, end of alley. He spoke to someone? Yeah, some beggar. How would you know that if he was around the corner? 'Cause he talked to him-- he's looking down. ( sirens wailing ) Won't do you any good. Yeah? Why not? Maxwell left 4:45. Guy who owns this place is cheapskate. Camera's not turned on till 6:00. I'll tell you what, you give me that tape... or you and your boss are going to be dancing just like that on Riker's Island. Police! Don't move! - Freeze! - Show me the gun! Thadeus Moore, you're under arrest for-- ( radios chatter ) Come on, don't get discouraged. What do you want me to tell you? It was a good lead. I tried to call you. Too bad he under the knife at the time of the second kill. How was I supposed to know? - You gotta investigate. - Fuck you, Charlie. I'm telling you, don't break my balls. I had a long night. This could have been good, listen to this. "If not for the fact that the suspect had a follow-up procedure on the day of the third kill, this would have been a historical breakthrough--" - Ooh, shit. - Yeah? And where were you? The warrant popped and where were you? Somebody had to make the call. It was a Robin move, that's all. Batman would never have done that. You know what? Go fuck yourself, really. I'm a dinosaur, huh? I'm a dinosaur? I guess you gotta kiss my big fat brontosaurus ass on this one, huh? Look at that. ( chuckles ) Made "The Times" as well. Whole world's full of shit, right? Keep your chin up, all right? - Keep your chin up. - All right, all right. ( groaning ) ( pills rattling ) ( water running ) What are you doing? You buying or selling? Which? Only a crazy man would be buying in this climate. Can I help you, Detective Daines? Call me Charlie, Adam. Will you? All right, Charlie Adam. ( chuckles ) You busted your ass on this, didn't you? Me? I'm a dinosaur. I ain't got the grasp, you know? Passed me by. So, you trying to make nice now? No. We're on the same case, aren't we? Still gotta crack it. You like beer? I'm actually a diet soda man, myself. My father was a cop. My uncle was a cop. My cousins were all cops up in the Bronx. All cops. Your mother? My mother hated cops. Hated every fuckin' one. ( laughs ) How ironic is that? I've been cut, shot, hacked and fucked over for 20 years. - I loved every minute of it. - Me too. - That's the life. - I got no complaints. - I got no boss and nobody to answer to. - There you go. - What's wrong with that, huh? - You tell me. This is where it's at. I don't know. Still feels pointless sometimes, though. Why pointless? - What are we here for? - Hey, Sully! Give me a little Johnnie. I mean, we're here to make a difference, right? Yeah. I think more than anything else, what you father and uncles had that we don't has got to be a sense of, I don't know, fulfillment. - Accomplishment. - I've had it. - You had it? - Fuckin' A well, I had it. The question is, do you have it now? Come on, man, you get it back. What the hell we here for? What's life about? Is there? Sully, come here. Look at this son of a bitch. How the hell you put an end to that crap? The financial stocks continue to slide as brokerages face mounting pressure from regulators. Banks face uncertainty... And in biotechnology, biotechs rallied today... - You made plans for dinner? - Hmm. - Let's get out of here. - Cool. ( game voices chatting ) Adam: I mean, take this case. Billions of dollars that could have been used to fight disease or help the homeless, where has it gone? It's wasted. - And you know what? It's gonna get worse. - Unless you catch him. Here's an analogy for you, all right? December the 6th, 1941, and we get intelligence that the Japanese are gonna strike Pearl Harbor. Instead of running to our cockpits we decide to go out for dinner, have a glass of wine and get a good night's sleep. I mean, it's lunacy, isn't it? So anyway, I get paid to consult and tell everybody that tomorrow's gonna be December the 7th. And still they don't do anything about it. So when the bombs come and I see the fear and terror in their eyes, I just sit back and watch with something less than amusement. - I'm sorry, I talk too much sometimes. - Not at all. - Can I help with the dishes? - No no. That's my job. All right. Hey, Stevie, you wanna see a dynamite cheat? Yeah, sure, you got a good one? ( coughing ) I'm just gonna take him back. Charlie, I'm worried about you. I'm gonna check into a hospital. I'm gonna get through this. You feel so good. Hit the triangle four times really fast. - ( beeping ) - Then hit the square three times. And hit select. ( laughing ) That's pretty cool, I like that. - How do you know that? - It's just my secret. - Not anymore, it's not. - Charlie: Hit the road? - Sure, I'm ready when you are. - You're the general. Take care, huh? Thank you, Detective. You have a very beautiful family. ( car starting ) Officer: 6:00 and 7:00. Yo, Daines! Expecting something from Happy Bob's porn shop, big fella? - Oh, yeah. - If my sister did one of those, I'd stick her tits in hot soup. Mickey: I'm telling you, he's not right. Hey. Hey. Uh, Charlie-- Fuck! Another one on the kill site! Adam, tell me you got a location or you're fuckin' fired. - I've got a signal. I think I'm close. - Close doesn't get it. Close does not fucking get it. Is she handcuffed to the wheel? Mickey: Holy shit, she's naked. Byrnes: Get a location, Adam. Adam: I got it! There it is. Byrnes: All right, let's move! Let's move! ( sirens wailing, people murmuring ) ( whimpers ) - Don't get too close. - Gotta get her out of there. - It's rigged! It's gonna blow! - I gotta get her out. - Get the fuck out of my way! - Are you crazy? No! Stop him! No! Charlie: No! No! ( panting ) Adam's voice: Thank you, Detective. You have a very beautiful family. ( coughs ) ( tires screeching ) - Jesus Christ. - Are you okay? Stevie, come on! Charlie: Get to your brother's house. Let's get the hell out of here now. - Mary: What the hell happened? - Charlie: Just wait in the car. Just wait in the car. Stevie! Stevie! You hear us calling you? Move your ass! - There's a message for you. - What'd you say to me? In my e-mail. You see what this guy's doing? You believe him and not me? Just 'cause he's a killer doesn't mean he's a liar. Are you accusing me of being unfaithful to your mother? - It's there for the world to see. - I met the kid at a hostel. She was whoring around chasing eight balls. - I'm the one got her off it. - What were you doing with her? She was in her second year of parole, I called in a favor. - For what? - Morphine! For the agony I'm in. Or haven't you noticed? Come in. Sit the fuck down. What in the motherfucking world was going on in your head when you ran up to that car? You had to know it was gonna be rigged. I mean, what the fuck happened yesterday? You wake up and forget everything you ever knew about police work? Talk to me, Charlie, because I am telling you in all my fucking days, that is the stupidest fucking thing I've ever seen a fellow officer do. Jesus fucking Christ! You better talk to me, Charlie. That was a crisis situation. Maybe you pulling a stupid fucking stunt like that caused that girl's death? Maybe this fucking maniac pulled the switch because he saw you running. For all you know, he was gonna let that car sit there until next fucking Christmas. We could've decorated the fucking thing! Tom, you don't know what the-- Shut the fuck up! ( phone ringing ) Get the fuck out of my office. ( siren blaring ) Man: Hey, what's up man? All right. All right. What's going on? What can I do for you? - Hey, you. - I'm busy. Keep walking, okay? - Want something hot? - I'm a cop, you wanna get locked up? Get the fuck outta here. ( chattering ) My partner over here, he's got the good shit. Enjoy. Take it easy. ( sighs ) ( needles clattering ) ( voices yelling ) ( phone ringing ) Yeah? Yeah, it's Mickey. We need to talk. - Yeah? - In private. Good, I like private. In fact, I know just the place. ( thunder rumbling ) You know I took you swimming here once when you were a kid? Do you remember that? Yeah, I remember. Do you? You look like shit, Charlie. What did you want? - I talked to Tommy. - Yeah? We're taking you off the case. Really? You're sticking shit in your arms, Charlie. You're an addict. I'm a what? - ( laughing, coughing ) - I remembered the girl. Arrested her two years ago, she was a street junkie. You started something up with her and you ended up like this. - ( coughing ) - Where's your self-respect? - I'm taking you to the doctor. - Ah! You fuck! God damn you! God damn you! God damn you! God damn you! ( both grunting ) ( gasping ) ( Charlie coughing ) You know the one bad thing that kid did on this earth? She hustled two drops of morphine. And you got me talkin' in a fucking shooting gallery? - You blab to Tommy about me? - I was worried! You set her up, you fuck. You set her up! - I didn't say anything! - Admit it. - What's going on in that fucking mind of yours? - Admit it! I didn't say a fucking word! I said nothing! - God damn it, if I fucking die here tonight! - I didn't say a word! Yeah? Come here! You gonna burn me? You wanna burn me! I never told Byrnes about the girl. I swear. I swear. ( elevator running ) - Can you help me? - No problem. - Thanks. - You in? - Yeah, going up? - Going down. What goes down, must come up, right? ( beeping ) ( alarm beeping ) There's got to be some way we can stop it. Are the backup files all secure? Man: Firewall's not working. Man #2: Save your files. We're fucked. Yeah, what is it? ( officer screaming ) ( body thuds ) ( dialing phone ) Man on phone: Anderson Shipping. Thank you, I'm trying to contact a company called Anderson Warehousing. Yes, sir. That's one of our divisions. Hold on and I'll connect you. ( ringing ) ( panting, whimpering ) ( dialing phone ) ( phone ringing ) - Yeah? - I think we got lucky. That bust we did below the Williamsburg Bridge last year, that was off John Street, wasn't it? Uh, John Street, John Street, yeah, I remember. Meet me there. ( bottle clattering ) ( distant whimpering ) ( whimpering continues ) ( muffled gagging ) ( wheezing, panting ) ( gasping ) - Move it. Move it, Charlie. - ( coughing ) Christ. You're all right. - Jesus Christ. - ( whimpering ) You all right? Look at me, look at me. You're all right. You're all right. - What's your name? - My name's Jim. Jim? I'm Charlie. You're gonna be all right. - You got kids, Jim? - Yeah, I got two. - Yeah? - Yeah. Me too, I got a boy. They drive you nuts, but you love the hell out of them, right? Jim: Yeah. There you go. You gonna be all right. Get up. - Get up. - ( grunting ) - All right! - ( all cheering ) ( laughing softly ) ( cheering continues ) You're a fucking saint. - Thank you! - Yeah, all right. - Get him a slice of pizza. - Thank you. Mickey: Come on, I got you. Easy, I got you. ( snickers ) ( cheering ) Hey, whoa whoa whoa. - ( scanner beeping ) - We've got a signal! - What the fuck is-- - ( beeping ) ( chuckling ) That's some lucky son of a bitch, huh, Charlie? No! ( groaning ) ( glass shards clattering ) Charlie? ( sobbing ) Charlie? ( rattling ) ( clicking, whirring ) ( beeps ) ( Adam screams ) ( panting ) Charlie: You're late on your rent. John Street. You had to give me that warning, show me how fucking smart you are. It might have worked. Listen to me. We gotta get out of here. Why's that? I said listen to me. This whole place is set to blow in four minutes. So we gotta get clear, do you understand me? - I think we're clear. - You think I'm lying to you? Huh? You fucking moron! Moron? Albeit, I'm the one who figured this out. I'm the one holding this piece on you. Albeit, I'm the one that's supposed to be dead here. And here I am talking to you. And I'm the moron here? - Albeit... - ( beeping ) I don't think so. ( grunts ) ( Adam groaning ) ( gasping ) ( coughing ) You're gonna leave me? Well, we know what you've done. And what you did to my little friend. I'm not guilty of doing anything wrong. What I did is nothing compared to the misery-- Yeah, I heard that crap. All the misery. Underneath all that fancy disease talk... you're nothing but an average neighborhood psychopath. - There you go then. - Fuck you. There's a theory about what destroyed the dinosaurs. Adam: It's not over, Mr. Detective. Charlie: One great big meteorite. There's plenty more out there just like me. - Some people think they survived in another form. - They're out there. If there's others out there, they're gonna find waiting for them... survivors like me. Fuck you. ( beeping ) You only got a few seconds left in the world, Adam. I wouldn't waste 'em on me. Where are you going? Where the fuck are you going? Come back here! Come back here! - ( humming ) - ( Adam groans ) Yeah. One great, big meteorite. ( screaming ) ( rapid ticking ) ( Adam screaming ) Charlie: Way to go. ( explosion ) ( techno music playing ) ? Everybody sees ? Some changes ? Everybody sheds a skin or two ? ?
