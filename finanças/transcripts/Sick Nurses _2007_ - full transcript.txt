Hello. I have a new body for you. Seven days? No problem. I'll store it for you. But you have to give me a deposit. I'll meet you at the same time, same place. 7 DAYS LATER Let me go before I tell everyone... ...that you make money from dead bodies! Make money from dead bodies! Doctor! Doctor! Quick. Inject her. No! I've already told you that practice makes perfect. It's fish maw soup. Here, let me get you some. Hello. It's me. Why haven't you picked it up yet? You have to wait. I am not ready yet. Not ready? But it's been seven days. There could be a problem with the body. You sell the bodies. You must know what needs to be done. There were never any problems before. Our customers were always content. But there could be a problem with your order. Calm down. I've already paid for it. Just wait for me at the usual place. Let's get married. Love Tahwaan Doctor Tar. Let's take a look at some wedding rings. Excuse me. This is Nook, my sister. You can go now. Don't even think about her. Next we will be presenting the award for doctor of the year. Please welcome Doctor Tar to the stage... ...who will receive his bouquet from Professor Yo. Doctor Tar is not only doctor of the year... ...but is also deeply loved by the staff of this hospital. Are you going to the ceremony? Look at all that makeup. What's wrong with a little makeup for work? So this is what 100,000 Baht tastes like. How many days has it been? Has what been? How many days has she been dead? Today is the seventh day. Why do you want to know? Did you know the dead always return to the one they love on the seventh day? If she knew that you wanted to take Doctor Tar from her... ...she would come for you tonight for sure. Are you out of your mind? Anyway, what could she do? It's almost midnight. And even if she did try something, with this little time... ...I'm sure she would come for you first, Aeh. You'll know soon enough. Why get married? What do you get in return? Will you get married And become a servant Or will you just tend to his garden? Low class scum should stay where they belong. You... You... Do you know you're the most beautiful girl in the world? No, you're the most beautiful. No, it's you. You're the most beautiful. You're the most beautiful. You are. You are. Close your eyes. That hurts. Now it's my turn. Close your eyes. - Let's play ghosts under the covers. - Come on. Let's play it. I'm under the covers already. Stop acting so sweet, the pair of you. It's time for work. What are you laughing at? - I won. - The loser must pay a forfeit. What kind of forfeit? - I've given you my heart. - You missed me and grazed my head. - Now you give me yours. - Here. Quickly. One more time. Here. - It went over there. - You're all crazy. If you don't love us then don't look. - But if you do look you will love us. - But if you do look you will love us.

Do you want to become a fat pig? I'll keep an eye on your weight for you. Get out of here. Shit. Hey. Hey. Let me go. Thanks, Tuwangwit. You know people who are born under Virgo shouldn't work in hospitals. Why not? It's a kind of conflict. What conflict? What do you mean? You have to stay virgins. - Oh, I see. - Get it? Can I borrow your telephone for a moment, ma'am? - Of course you can. Here. - Thank you. Just a second. Hello. You old fart. You just can't control yourself around young girls. - Hello. - You insane bitch. Why did you do that? You're out of order. Sorry. Excuse me. Who are you? Who are you? Your damn husband.

No! - Quick. Inject her. - Let me go! Orn. She's a person, not just some dead body. Tell them, Nook. Tell them to stop. What should we bet on next? I'm bored of doing it for whiskey. How about if the winner can ask anything of the loser? Are you up for it? No worries. Damn it. I've lost again. What do you want? You have to promise you'll do it first. Okay. Let's get married. You're crazy. I can't marry a man. Please don't do this to me. For the sake of a child, please. Have mercy on me.
