Subtitles: Lu?s Filipe Bernardes I hope you won't be discouraged, Professor Brooke, if you find yourself with a small class. American students seem to flock to the easy courses. Well, it's much the same in England, Professor Guthrie. Thank you so much for showing me around. Professor Ronald Brooke, exchange professor from England, will conduct a series of lectures on Greek mythology. How about advanced economics, Ted? You'll learn how to take care of your old man's dough. Uh-uh, he knows how to do that. Hey, fellas, how about this Greek mythology? Sounds like a pushover. Pushover? Let's ask this guy, he looks like a post grad. Say, did you ever take this Greek course? Know anything about it? - A little. - Mythology professor. Probably some grumbling old fluff. I'll bet he has a long white beard. And very likely moth-eaten. With a monocle. Pip-pip, carry on, dash it all! Well, how about it, pal, is the course stiff? Should we take it? Oh, I'd say it was a pushover. See, what did I tell you? Let's all register in it. What are we waiting for? - Are you going to be there? - Oh, I shan't miss a class. Good! Wonder if I should've brought a notebook. No, a pillow. This is where Mrs. Dayton's little boy catches up on his sleep. Gentlemen, I know you'll be happy to meet Brand's new exchange professor. Professor Ronald Brooke from England. - How do you do? - And I want to congratulate all of you... on taking a course that, although difficult, will, I'm certain, prove to be fascinating. Thank you, sir. You know, this instance reminds me of one of old Aesop's fables. The one about the wolf in sheep's clothing, of course. Only, in this instance, the wolf turns out to be an exchange professor from England. Of course, I realize how disappointed you must be... that I haven't a long white beard. And that, however much of an old fluff I may be, it isn't apparent to the naked eye. I hope. All you have to do is to pass a rather stiff examination at the end of the term. And before I hear too many groans, let me say that I'm going to begin the course... by exploring the night life of Cytherea. A rather high-spirited wench of ancient times, as a matter of fact, so high-spirited that students have been known... to take up Greek just in order to read it in the original. Well... Pip-pip, dash it all, shall we carry on? And remember, you're waitresses, not entertainers. No unnecessary conversation with the students. - Put your legs together. - They are! Some of you may have heard that last year... two of the girls married rich college boys. This term, both of them asked for their jobs back. So let that be a... Well? - Did you shorten that skirt? - No, ma'am. I starched it. - Starched it? - Hm-hmm, starched it. Humph. Let out the hem. The students are supposed to keep their minds on their studies. And you girls must remember... that we're only here to satisfy their appetite for food. That's all. You may go now. - Will you sit up here, please? - Thank you. Jenny. - Could I have some tea? - Black or green? - Ceylon, of course. - Oh, Ceylon. - And marmalade and toast. - White wheat, raisin, or Russian rye? I beg your pardon? Do you want white bread, or Russian rye bread, or raisin bread or... Plain white bread, if you please. - What time is it, miss? - I don't know. This isn't my table. I see you've discovered Brand's favorite tearoom, professor. Yes. - Greek. - She looks American. Sorry, I thought you were looking at my notes. Your tea, sir. What's this, a surgical dressing? You dunk it in the water. - You what? - Dunk, as in doughnut. - Haven't you ever dunked a doughnut? - Should I have? Oh, if you haven't you've missed a lot of fun. Look, it's easy. And then you drink it? Unless it's too hot. - Oh... oh, I know. - Hm? I bet you like it the English way. Well, what ever gave you that idea? I guess it's the way you talk. It's all right, He's not a student. I'll bring your toast and marmalade right away. I say, could I be of any help? No, thank you. I was just practicing. Well, when you've finished, may I have my paper? Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you were through with it. No, I followed you because I was afraid you were running off with my Greek. No, those notes there. - Is this girl a friend of yours? - I wish she was. - Good heavens, why? - Maybe she could tell me how to do it. - Do what? - Go to Paris. Do you mind if I sit down? Do you mean to say that you want to emulate this... that is, be like this young woman? Why not? She's on her way to Paris. I'm afraid I don't quite understand. Well, look... There's a story like this in the newspapers almost every day. You see, the boy always promises to marry the girl... and the boy's father always says no. Then he always gives the girl money to give up the boy... then the girl always goes to Paris. But my dear child, that's blackmail. And rather a drastic means of getting to Paris. Oh, it sounds very simple to me. The boy has a good time, and the girl has a good time... and the father's so rich he never misses the money. Yes, but it's hardly cricket. And... You know, I don't even know your name. Jenny, after my Swedish grandmother. Well, Jenny, even if your reasoning were sound, your scheme would still be a little illegal. Oh, I don't see why. Now let's pretend that you're a rich man's son... and you're in love with me. - That's legal, isn't it? - Oh, yes, absolutely. But your father says no and, uh... - ...so he pays me money... - Oh, but wait a minute. That's where it stops being legal. Just at the interesting part. - What's your name? - Ronald Brooke. Ronnie, after my English grandfather. That's my shift. The geometry class will be in... and they'll want buckets of coffee to wake them up. Did you ever hear the Aesop fable about the sick lion? Well, all the animals used to come to inquire about his health. One day the fox came. And the lion said, 'Oh, dear, I feel so weak today.' Please come inside and hold my hand. But the fox noticed that although the lion said he was sick... he was really very fat. And that all of the footprints led into the cave... and none of them led out. The moral, my dear Jenny, is never venture into anything... unless you can see your way out. Oh, don't worry, I'll always look for a way out. Bye, Professor. - Jenny! Are you hurt? - No. No, I'm all right, it's just my knee. What the devil do you mean by coming down the street in that great speed? - Sorry, Professor... - Sorry? Do you realize you might have killed this young woman? Not a chance, these brakes will stop on a dime. The problem with you, Dayton, is your father has too much money. You think you're a privileged character. - It's young fellows like you that... - Professor, please. After all, I am all right and his brakes are good. Say, thanks. Is there anything I can do? Well, I'm a little late for work and I should change my stockings. - It's too far to walk. - Well then, may I? Thank you. Bye, Professor, don't forget your paper. So I've discovered. All it needs is a little service. Just put them back together, that's fine. Hello, honey, how about an ice cream and cherry coke? - Chocolate soda. - And a pot of tea for me, and no cracks. - Good afternoon, Jenny. - I'm not Jenny. Oh... Good afternoon anyway. Jenny's gone to Hansonville. She won't be back until tonight. - Hansonville? Uh-oh! - Here I am again, folks, your old question and answer man. Now, today we have a special quiz on Hansonville. And question number one is why did Jenny go to Hansonville? Because Ted Dayton went to Hansonville. Hooray! This guy's a genius! All right, question number two. What town beginning with H has a parson charges only two bucks? Let me see, uh... - Hoboken. - Ah, Hoboken! Hey, you're mussing my hair. - All right, students! - Hansonville! Very good, very good, that's right. And now we come to the brain twister of the evening. What famous professor of Greek is slowly losing his favorite waitress? Come on now, Professor, who is it? Me. Hooray! Very good! Dunk! Ted, I've been an indulgent father. I've given you everything you asked for. How was I to know you'd be fool enough to propose marriage to a... A waitress. You say my son promised to marry you. Yes. Gosh, Dad, it was just fun. I didn't really propose to her. But he did promise to marry me. - You can't prove it! - But I have letters. You mean Ted proposed to you in writing? Yes, he did. In every letter, every day. - Did you propose to her in writing? - No. No, sir. We'll see who's lying. Let's see those letters. Well? I guess I didn't bring them with me. I thought you were lying. Did you hear that? No you don't. You're going to tell your little story to a judge. No, I wouldn't care to, thank you. - Just a minute... - I've got to do my duty, she'a a blackmailer. I think we've got her scared plenty. You'd better run while you've got the chance. I'll try and square things with the officer. Oh, thank you, Mr. Dayton, I'll never forgive you... - ...forget you for this. - Never mind that. See that you get out of Brand tonight... or we'll make that town so hot you can scramble eggs on the sidewalk. Yes, I will. Any report on my call to Hansonville? Mr. Dayton and his son left the hotel? Cancel the call, will you, please? - Hello. - So there you are! Oh, Professor, I'm in such trouble. Well, don't stand there making puddles, come in. Get those wet things off, you'll catch cold. - I had to see you. - I've been expecting you. You have? Here, put these on. So you went to Hansonville. - How did you know? - And now you're in trouble. Yes. Well... tell me the whole sad story. It looks just the way you said. I forgot about the sick lion and walked right into his den. Mr. Dayton showed me the way out. He was a little cross. I say, you didn't ask him for money! Oh, yes. That was part of my plan. You remember, don't you? Yes, I remember. Then, when I couldn't show him the letters... Do you mean to say that you told him Ted had written you letters? Sure, I had them in my bag all the time. You... You had letters, from Ted... in your bag. - And you didn't show them to him? - I started to... Then I remembered all the things you told me and... I got the funniest feeling in my stomach. - In your stomach? - Yes, it felt like this... - Like what? - Like this. That was a flutter, Jenny. That was your conscience talking. Does that mean I'll never be able to do anything wrong? Not with your solar plexus. No, Jenny, I'm afraid you're doomed to be a good girl. You'll feel better after a good night's sleep. And tomorrow we'll talk this whole thing out. Oh, I can't! I've got to leave town tonight. If I don't, they'll scramble eggs on the sidewalk. Mr. Dayton said so. Do you mind if I have a drink? Well, I guess there's nothing left to do but go back home to Maple Leaf. I think that's a very good idea, Jenny. - You do? - Yes, I do. You go home and forget there's any royal road to wealth. Be yourself, Jenny. Follow your flutter. And someday the right man will come along. - Not in Maple Leaf. - Yes, even in Maple Leaf. But Jenny, keep away from young men with large cars and small characters. And don't accept things from them. - Nothing? - Well, flowers, fruit and candy. - And hospitality? - Only of the right sort, Jenny. But Jenny, don't be discouraged. Good girls go to Paris too. If I go home to Maple Leaf, there won't be anybody to make your tea for you... the English way. Well, as a matter of fact, I'm leaving myself tomorrow. - You are? - Yes, I'll finish my lectures... and then, Jenny, I'm going to be married. Go back to England. - Married. - Yes, even college professors get married. Well... I suppose there isn't any reason why they shouldn't. I'm going to get married myself someday. A French duke or something. Jenny, remember what I told you. Is she the one? - Yes, that's Sylvia. - What's she like? Oh, she's charming, beautiful, as you can see. Well, guess I'd better get my shoes on. Oh, Jenny... Here's something I wanted to give you before I left. Aesop's fables. That's what you're always talking about, isn't it? Yes. It's a wonderful present. Thanks. Thanks a lot. Er, what time does your train leave? - Nine o'clock. - Oh dear, you'd better hurry. I'm all packed. - Have you enough money? - I'm gonna buy $7 worth of tickets... and thumb the rest of the way. - Thumb? - Get rides, like this. Oh, but you can't do that. Well, if I don't get any rides, I only have to walk two dollars' worth. Here. That isn't flowers, fruit or candy. Oh, no... of course not, but... Well, this is different, you and I are old friends. Here now, you consider that a loan. You can pay me back at another time. You're awfully good. You've done so much for me. Well, I like you, Jenny. I like you too. You'd better go now. You'll miss your train. - Bye. - Goodbye, Jenny. Oh, Jenny, here's my address in London. - Will you write to me? - Yes. - Goodbye. - Goodbye, Jenny. Oh, Jenny, wait. You'd better take this umbrella. Thank you. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. I don't suppose you'll ever come to Maple Leaf. Oh, no... No. Bye. - Bye. - Goodbye. Hello? Hello, Tom. You're leaving tonight? I thought you... No, no, I'll take you to the station. It won't take long. I'll be right over. I'd like a ticket to Maple Leaf, Minnesota, please. Can you imagine anyone wanting to go to Maple Leaf? - Where to, miss? - New York... City! Thank you. This way to New York train, miss. Hello, Jenny. Hello. - Hello. - Hello. Oh, I'm sorry. This is Tom Brand. Jenny Swanson. - How do you do? - Brand? Is this your university? - No, it's my grandfather's. - Oh... It's funny, I never saw you in the tearoom. Jenny, Tom is my future brother-in-law. He came down to dedicate the gymnasium to his grandfather. All aboard! You'll miss your train, Jenny. - Well now... goodbye. - Goodbye, Jenny. You see, I'm sort of a father confessor to her. You're lucky I have a broadminded sister. Tell her I'm leaving right after my last lecture tomorrow. Okay. - So long. - Goodbye, Tom. You're a funny girl, Jenny. You read Aesop's fables, and you won't accept anything but candy, fruit and flowers. And hospitality... of the right sort. - Haven't you any vices? - I did have but... Professor Brooke reformed me. - Where did you meet Ronnie anyway? - At the Butterfly Tearoom. I waited on tables there. Oh, it was a lovely job. Hm, and you lost it. I had to leave town. - You what? - I had to leave. They told me if I didn't, they'd get the town so hot... you could scramble eggs on the sidewalk. - What the devil did you do? - I tried to blackmail a college boy. Blackmail? Say, don't you know you're not supposed to mention a thing like that? It wasn't successful. Well, maybe you can try again during the winter term. My flutter won't let me. Your what? There's something in here that tells me if I'm right or wrong. If it's still, then it's all right. But if it flutters, it's wrong. A flutter will be an awful handicap in New York. Oh, I shouldn't be on my way to New York. I should be on my way to Maple Leaf, Minnesota. But when I went to that ticket window and thought of working in the grocery store... again and waiting on that old Mrs. Perkins, and taking care of the Hopkins children at night, I... Well, I just bought a ticket to New York. Well, um... did you get a flutter? Well, that was only half a flutter, I... I thought maybe something I ate. Jenny, I like you. But you shouldn't have fooled around with those penny-ante college boys. - Why didn't you wait for me? - Are you sure you're rich? Well, my grandfather just gave away another million. Of course he can take it off his income tax. Oh, Tom, you have such nice blue eyes. Oh, dear... Excuse me, miss. Would you like me to make up your berth? - You's in number 4, ain't you? - Oh, it's bedtime. And your drawing room's ready, Mr. Brand. Call us in the observation car, Sam. - And knock before you enter. - Yes, sir. Hey, let us know how you come out. That's nice, isn't it? Want your shoes cleaned, Mr. Brand? No, thank you. Come in. Ain't this a mistake, miss? No, this is hospitality. Ah! Hospitality. Here it is, Jenny. Music, gaiety, beautiful women. Where Park Avenue meets Broadway in an atmosphere of magic romance. I bet this place has a lot of dirty laundry. Jenny, did anyone ever tell you that you're very lovely? Uh-huh. You did, in the last place. Uh-oh, I'm repeating myself. Oh, it doesn't need changing yet. Look. It doesn't show. What time is it? I have to get up early and look for a job, you know. - Waiter! Check. - Yes, sir. Hello, Tom, darling. Hello. - When are you going away? - I just got back. Then do have a nice trip. It's my mother. Your father looks awfully young. That's not my father. That's Paul Kingston, my mother's boyfriend. You paying for everybody? Keep it. Thank you, sir. Jenny, we'll get my car and we'll do the town. - Must we? - Oh, sure. - Good evening, Mr. Brand. - Hi, Louie. - Here. - Oh, thank you, Mr. Brand, - No, no, champagne. - Could I get some milk for me, please? The only place left after this is the gutter. Don't get me wrong. It's a great place here. They give me anything I want. Anything at all. You're wanted in the back room, Mr. Brand. - Who wants me? - Mr. Schultz. Oh. Excuse me, Jenny. My past is catching up with me. - When do you finish at the hospital, Dennis? I'll be a full-fledged doctor in a week. Then only three more years of starvation while I build up a practice. You're going to change your mind, Sylvia, and starve with me. You know, even when we were children... you always said you were going to be a doctor. Your face! What's the matter with it? Nothing... I thought I saw it once in a picture. Sylvia, darling, congratulations! I understand you're to be married next week. - Is this the lucky man? - No, darling. I'm only the man she loves. Oh, dear, how very droll. Well, goodbye, darling. I hope you'll be very happy. Why did you say that, Dennis? I don't think that's funny. Well, I guess it wasn't. But it's the truth. Sylvia, why don't you tell Olaf you're in love with me? Oh, don't be so difficult, Dennis. People have been disinherited before. They still breathe, and walk around on two feet. But Olaf would make such a thorough job of it. - What do you want? - Please pass the salt. Let's get out of here. - Waiter. - Yes, sir. Check, please. - Hello, Tom, aren't you going to buy us a drink? - No, next time, girls. - Oh, come on, please. - Excuse me. - Remember me? I'm your sister. Oh, hello, Sylvia. Hiya, Dennis. - Just saw Mom over at El Morocco. - How's she doing? She was holding her own. Say, you'd better stay away from Olaf when you get home. - He's on the war path again. - Ahhh! Come on. I'm terribly sorry, Jenny. A little matter of pressing business. A man named Shultz pressing me for $5.000. Gambling debt. Only I didn't know they were playing for keeps. - Tom, was that your sister? - Yep. Now you've seen the House of Brand with their hair down. But she's going to marry Professor Brooke. - That's the program. - Tom, I don't understand. You mean that man with her? We all lived together... in the same house as kids, only Dennis had to use the back stairs. - Back stairs? - Great guy, though. He worked his way through medical school. Tom... Is your sister in love with Professor Brooke? Jenny, you're old-fashioned, and I like it. - Mr. Brand, what is the trouble? - Trying to slip me a Mickey, eh? Poisoning an old customer. Come on, Jenny, let's get out of here. I'm sorry, Mr. Brand, I bring you another bottle. Trying to give me the business. Are you sure you live here? Looks vaguely familiar. Oh, wait a minute. It's this way. - You live here? - No. Do I? If you don't, you have got an awful lot of explaining to do in the morning. - Pardon me. - Certainly. Are you somebody I should know? My name's Jenny Swanson. - Did you come out of Tom's room? - Yes. Now look here, young lady, I'm broadminded, but this is going to far. No, it's all right. Tom's... Again? And I brought him home. Did his grandfather see him? No, nobody saw him. Well, run along. Hurry, get out of the house. - And don't get my son drunk again. - All right. What? I didn't get your son drunk! That's not fair! He got that way himself. I tried to stop him. Who's there? What's all this racket out here? Wait a minute! What do you mean standing outside a man's door... shouting at this hour of the night? It's a wonder I don't have two nervous breakdowns. I got it! It was about to bite you. - Who are you? - My name's Jenny Swanson. Wha... what are you doing here? Well, I... You don't have to yell at me! Who's yelling? Olaf, what on earth are you doing out of bed? I spend $100.000 a year on your stupid doctors... and you let strangers wander around my house at night waking me up! But Father, this isn't a stranger, this is er... - Jenny. - Yes, of course! It's Jenny. She's a friend of Sylvia's. An old, old friend. They were at Briarmont together. They played on the same, er... a basketball team, didn't you, darling? - Oh, a friend of Sylvia's, huh? - Yes! Well, so then you're here for the wedding. Yes, that's it! She's one of Sylvia's bridesmaids. Then where is Sylvia? Why isn't she here looking after her guests... instead of leaving them to wander around the hall alone? Now you see what you've done? My throat is sore again! Mr. Brand, if your throat is sore... it's very soon to stand around these drafty halls. You don't have to tell me that! Any fool knows as much! Why didn't you stay in bed? We spend a fortune trying to heat this house and it's cold as an icebox. Well, you should have more blankets on your bed. - Swedes need to sweat. - By golly, she's right. I haven't had a good sweat since I left Minnesota. Caroline, send for the doctor. My throat is killing me. Oh, you don't need a doctor for that. I can fix your throat in a second. - Oh, you could? - Yes. All you need to do is put hard lard and turpentine... on a piece of red flannel rag and tie it around your throat. It feels better right away. - Oh, that's silly. - What's silly about it? My grandmother used to do it. Yes, and a good old Swedish drink like aquavit, that always helps. By golly, now you're talking. Get Chambers. Oh, Father, you'd better let me call Dr. Brown. Call Chambers. Oh, Chambers... Strip of red flannel and a bottle of aquavit. Yes, madame, right away. - I beg your pardon. - Hello, Chambers. - Anything wrong, Chambers? - Oh, no, miss. They phoned from upstairs for some hot lard. If it's Tom, don't pay any attention to him. It's your mother. I hope you won't mind the smell. Probably Mother's latest beauty wrinkle. I've got the lard heating and I now where the turpentine is, but there's no red flannel. Not a bit of red flannel in the house, sir. Oh, dear, I thought they'd given up treasure hunts. Get the turpentines. I'll get the red flannel. Did they get you up too, Jeffers? Yes, Miss Sylvia. It seems to be very urgent. A question of strip of red flannel. - How are you, dad? - Fine, Dennis. Did you fix up the guest room for Jenny? Yes, sir. Well, see that you take good care of her, Chambers. Fill it up. But, sir, this is the second bottle of aquavit. - And you know what the doctor said. - Shut up, you dumhuvud waiter! Shh! He doesn't understand Swedish. And quit shouting so much. That's what gives you high blood pressure. And anyway... People pay more attention to you when you whisper. - They do? - Yes. - Please, Mr. Brand. - Get out. Yes, sir. - How's that? - Oh, fine. - Skol! - Skol! - Where's Mr. Jeffers? - In the kitchen. - Mr. Jeffers. - Yes? Mr. Brand is coming down for breakfast. Hurry, everybody. Why, he never eats breakfast with the family. He hasn't been down for breakfast in three years. Mr. Tom, your grandfather's coming down to breakfast. Miss Sylvia, your grandfather's coming down to breakfast. Mrs. Brand... - Good morning, Jeffers. - Good morning, sir. Well, where is everybody? They're all late. - Yes, sir. - Fine family I've got. The first time I've been down to breakfast in three years... - ...and everybody's late. - Yes, sir. - Good morning, sir. - Good morning, Jeffers. Oh, good morning, Grandfather. I don't know why people can't be on time. Ronnie... Ronny'll be in on the 9:00 train. Good morning, Father. You're late, Caroline. - Hello! - Hello. Did you sleep well? Stop that racket! Yes, sir. Best sleep I've had in twenty years. Tom, I tried to find you before breakfast. I want you to meet an old school chum of Sylvia's. - Jenny... - Swanson. Of course. They were to school together. They played on the same hockey team. Oh, Tom, isn't it exciting? Jenny's going to be Sylvia's bridesmaid at the wedding. - Bridesmaid? - Yes, you know, dear, It's the one that walks along down the aisle. It's just like the best man. Only it's a woman. And we're going to have twelve. Stop that foolish chatter, Caroline. Now what do you think would be a good thing... for a sick man to have for breakfast? - Herring. - You hear that, Ada? One herring. I don't believe there's such an article in the house, sir. What kind of a house is this that hasn't got a herring? Good morning, Grandfather. Sylvia, darling. Are you going to be surprised! Now here's your old roommate, Jenny. You remember, from Briarmont? - Why, you're the... - Shhh! - How do you do? - Jenny's come all the way from... Maryland, just to be one of your bridesmaids. Now, isn't that sweet of her? Oh, very! So nice to see you again. Oh, is it? Well, you don't act like it. You modern girls are certainly cold fish. It wasn't that way when I was young. Grandfather, it's just that it was such a surprise to me. It's the way you brought her up! She has no manners. Who is she, one of your roommates? - So, you're from Maryland, eh? - No, Minnesota. Caroline always gets things wrong. A fine state, Minnesota. I came from there myself. I never should have left there. I started forty years ago in Minnesota as a lumberjack. I remember the time I rescued two men from a log jam. - Biscuit, Jenny? - Now don't change the subject! Mr. Brooke is arriving, Miss Sylvia. How are you, darling? Fine. I'm sorry I couldn't go to the train. Well, bring him in here! What are you doing out there? - How are you, Ronnie, my boy. - Plenty, thank you, and how are you, sir? - Hello, Tom. - How are you, Ronnie? - Darling, you sit right over there. - Thank you. - How are you, Mrs. Brand? - I'm fine... So far. Jenny. Jenny, come here. Oh, you don't know our Jenny. Miss Jenny Swanson, Mr. Ronald Brooke. He's the lucky man. How do you do? - It's nice to meet you. - The pleasure's all mine. You know, I knew a family named Swanson once. They lived in a town called Maple Leaf. Jenny and Sylvia went to Briarmont together. Oh, really? I would have guessed that you'd just come from a college town. Oh, yes, Jenny was on the hockey team. Oh, yes, of course! You recently played Hansonville, didn't you? You took an awful licking as I remember it. Yes, I did. But you can't always win. Ronnie, I didn't know that you were interested in women's sports. Oh, yes. Yes, I've followed some of the players all over the country. Did you have a nice trip, Ronnie? - Yes. Did you? - Yes. Oh, he likes tea the English way. That is, all Englishmen like tea the English way. Say, our Jenny's a bright girl. She knew right off that you were English. Oh, yes indeed. And now, after all these years, Jenny's going to be Sylvia's bridesmaid. Bridesmaid? Didn't you know they had bridesmaids at weddings? Oh, yes, I'm sorry. The word always makes me jump. Ever since my Great-aunt Agatha had a bridesmaid who went in for blackmail. Oh, excuse me, I'm a litte bit nervous today. I was out late last night. Oh, you were? And who kept you out late? Well, it wasn't Tom, because when I came in his light was out. I thought I heard you sneaking in last night. Oh, it wasn't me, it must have been Dennis and... Say, what's got into this family? Now, there's something fishy going on around here and... Whisper. You're a liar! What are you trying to hide from me? I don't know, Father. I wasn't listening. - Biscuit, anybody? - Thank you. - Coffee, sir? - What is everybody whispering about? Now this family is trying to keep something from me. I insist on knowing what's happening right under my nose! - You'd better sit down. - I'll sit down when I find out... It may be too late! His face is turning purple. Like my uncle's. And he went out like a light. What's all this... this about? You tell him, doctor. Oh, you're not a doctor, are you? You're a professor. Get him some water, somebody! And he needs air. - I knew, I knew this would happen! - Hey! He needs fresh air. But I ought to go. You see how he looked... He feels... he's... he's... It's me. Jenny, what are you doing here? I'm a bridesmaid. How did you get in this house? I thought you'd be surprised. Well, I shouldn't be. I saw you getting chummy with Tom Brand in that train. Oh, that's not fair. You introduced me to him and all I took was flowers, fruit and candy and your kind of hospitality. What happened on that train? Well, we got very friendly and I slept in his drawing room. What? Yeah, Tom had to double up to get into my berth but he said he didn't mind. Go on. Well, when we got to New York, Tom drank a little bit too much... - ...and the policeman said... - Policeman? Yes, the policeman was going to take him to jail... so I brought him home and put him to bed. Jenny, why did you have to pick on this family to blackmail? Oh, I didn't. It was an accident. I mean... But you did find out that Tom's family has money, didn't you? Yes! Oh, yes, they have millions! Jenny. Mother, it's ridiculous having her for my bridesmaid. But it was a marvelous excuse, and the first thing I could think of. Father really put the words right into my mouth. She'll be the only decent bridesmaid you'll have. Now, Sylvia, we've got to go through with this. Yes, do you want to get me kicked out? Look here, Jenny, I can't let you stay here. I don't know what you're going to do next. Neither do I. I'm just waiting to see what I'm going to do. I do know what you're going to do. You're going to leave here. Find some excuse, any excuse, I don't care what! Eights. Come in. - Feeling better? - What do you want? Well, I didn't know you were busy. I wanted to ask you about something. I'll go out. You might as well stay. You seem to be running this family anyway. Sit down! What is it now? I just had a notice from the bank. It seems I'm overdrawn. - How much? - Quite a bit. Five thousand dollars. How in tarnation did you ever spend five thousand dollars? Oh, on some things. Get out of my sight, you insolent young pup... Get out before I lose my temper. Five thousand dollars! When I was your age I was living on $3 a week. Used molasses instead of sugar in my coffee. Get out! - Come on, let's play. - Thinks money grows on trees. It's about time I kicked that selfish loafer out. Let him find out what hard work really means. Of course I think you're all wrong about Tom. He's one of the nicest young men I've ever met. - Oh, you like him, huh? - Yes, I do. Of course I think he needs to settle down a bit. Well, maybe you're right about Tom, Jenny. He is a fine young man when you come to think of it. - Upstanding. He has a fine future, Jenny. - Then you'll give him the five thousand? I will not! But I think you're right about the settling down part. And I believe you're just the girl to do it. Oh, that's silly. Tom doesn't think about me that way. Sixes. Don't be stupid. Then it's up to you that he starts thinking about you that way. - Eights. - Hey, wait a minute! You can't take it with an eight. That's my build and my six bucks. Oh, yes I can. Six and two make eight. You can't add to my build, you're cheating. Cheating? Why, you... you... - Now, now, you'll lose your breath. - No, I won't. I want it for what I have to tell you. Nobody ever accused me of cheating before! They're afraid to. But if someone doesn't tell you about a bad habit... it just grows and grows on you till you... until you even start cheating people in business. Oh, cheating in business. That's good. Where would you get in business if you didn't take advantage of the other fellow? Here's an old friend of mine who'd cut my throat for a nickel. Now he wants to give some land to my university. Cut in on my glory. But I fooled him. I took an option on the land myself. Now he'll have to come to me. Did you say an old friend? Yeah, an old scoundrel named Dayton. Dayton? Does he have a son? Yeah, Ted Dayton. Probably a chip off the old block. The father made his money in cars. - Bad ones, too. - They have good brakes. Well, what if Dayton is a crook? That's no sign you have to be. And besides, this is my dollar! Hey, what about another game? You ought to give me a chance to get my dollar back! - Hello, Jenny, Have a good time today? - Oh, yes. I've been gambling with Olaf. I won, too. Jenny, what did you say you'd been doing with Olaf? - Gambling. - Look here, Jenny, this has gone too far. I insist that you give back every penny. - How much did you win. - A dollar. Oh. - What are you giving it to me for? - That's for my fair to Maple Leaf. Now I only owe you $49. Thanks, Jenny, but there's no hurry. Nevertheless, you'll have to leave here. I haven't thought of a good excuse yet. Well, I have. You're going to get a telegram from your mother. - I haven't got a mother. - Oh. Well, from your aunt then. Aunt... what's a good Swedish name? Helga. Well, your aunt Helga is going to break her leg. Or have a nervous breakdown or something. And then you'll have to leave for Maple Leaf immediately. It'll be better for you too, Jenny. It will, really. I want to send a telegram. Yes, and it goes to Miss Jenny Swanson, 1417, Larchwood Road, Long Island, N.Y. Play a game of pool, Tom? - Jeffers, have any telegrams come? - No, sir. - Want to play, Jenny? - No, thanks. Telegram, Miss Swanson. - Hope it isn't bad news. - It's from my aunt Helga. She hopes I'm having a good time and she says I can stay as long as I want to. And she sends her love. - May I get you a liquor, Jenny? - No, thank you, I don't care for any. That's fine. What do you mean? Why didn't you read what was in that wire the way I said it to you? - I got a flutter. - You should have. Lying about it. It wasn't that. It's just that I haven't got an aunt Helga. Now see here, Jenny. I know perfectly well your reasons for being in this house... but let me warn you. If I catch you looking in Tom's direction, I'll tell Olaf all about you. I will! - Shall we dance, Sylvia? - Yes. When I was a young man, when I wanted a girl, I went after her. Jenny, you've done enough drinking for one night. Let's take a ride. Oh, Tom, I'm awfully sorry, but I already have a date for tonight. - Who with? - With, uh... Paul. With Paul? Paul Kingston, don't you dare leave! I'm sorry, it seems I can't leave right now, do you mind? Well, that settles that. Come in. Oh, hello, Ronnie, my boy. Come on in. Sit down. Have a drink? No, thanks, I rather thought I'd wait up for Tom. Oh, he's still out with Jenny. I hope she helps him. You hope she does what? Of course he doesn't deserve her but she'd make him a great little wife. Wife? - What are you talking about? - Jenny. She'd make a nice wife for Tom. Yes, of course, she's a nice girl and all that, but... - You hardly know her. - I don't have to. I like her. And Tom loves her. Look here, Mr. Brand, there's something I must tell you. - Go ahead. - Well, I'm going to tell you this. It's rather a difficult thing to tell you, I... - I don't exactly... - You don't exactly what? - I don't exactly... - What's the matter? I've got a funny feeling in my stomach. - Hi, Jeffers. - Good morning, sir. - Has Miss Swanson come down yet? - Yes, sir, she's gone for a walk. - Oh, she has? - With Mr. Kingston, sir. Oh. Oh, Jeffers. Just a moment. - Good morning, sir. - Good morning, Jeffers. - Is Miss Swanson at breakfast? - No, sir, she's gone for a walk. - Oh, she has? - With Mr. Kingston, sir. Oh. Hello. Hello. I asked Jenny to marry me last night. You did? She said no. Ronnie, I wonder if you'd talk to her for me. - Well... - She puts a lot of faith in what you say. And I know she likes me a lot but for some reason she keeps holding back. That's fine... Er, is that so? And Olaf's all for it, surprisingly enough. - I'll speak to her all right. - Thanks! - Good morning. - Good morning. Stomach better this morning? It's not quite what it should be. Well, where's Jenny? - She... - She... - She's gone for a walk. - Alone? - With Paul Kingston. - Paul Kingston! And you call yourselves men. - Where are you going? - I'm going to find Jenny. Fine fianc? you are. Why aren't you out walking with her? Come along, help me find her. - Are you coming, Ronnie? - No, no, of course not. Oh, please, Mr. Kingston. Oh, please, Mr. Kingston... - Jenny! - Oh, please, Mr. Kingston! Please, Mr. Kingston... No! - Mr. Kingston! - Call me Paul. Mr. Kingston, let's keep on walking. You know it stimulates your heart. Oh, just being with you does that. Please don't misunderstand about last night. It was nothing, as you have to understand. ??? Oh, you didn't do so badly yourself. I had to, Professor Ronnie doesn't want me to go out with Tom. - What's he got to do with it? - He's afraid I'll try to blackmail Tom. - But that's absurd. - Oh, no it isn't. He knows I tried it once with another rich boy. You'd better watch out. I am a blackmailer. How charming. I'd be afraid if I weren't such slim picking. Oh, please, Mr. Kingston! I wouldn't dream of interfering with you and Caroline. - People will say you're stewing. - But Caroline's a very dear friend of mine. But she's more the motherly type. Oh, but you, Jenny, you're different. You're not like any other woman I've ever known before. You're a dream, a poem. You're like a dewy wild flower waiting to be crushed. - Jenny, why are you running? - I always run before breakfast. It stimulates your heart. Come on. Jenny, stop this foolishness. I want to talk to you. What do you mean by worming a proposal out of Tom last night? How did you know? Well, is it my fault if Tom asked me to marry him? Or is it. I suppose you didn't make yourself as pretty as possible last night. Why, you caught him like a rat in a trap. Did I really look pretty? You were wonderful! You looked radiant! You were positively starry-eyed. I tell you I won't have it. Oh, Jenny, don't you realize how empty a loveless marriage can be? Yes, I do. That's why I told Tom I couldn't marry him. I hope you mean that, Jenny. Paris must wait until... until you feel about someone the way Sylvia feels about me. - Sylvia do... Sylvia... - What? - What about Sylvia? - Oh, nothing. Now look here, that's no answer. You started to say something. Aesop says wise men say nothing in dangerous times. - Yes, sir? - My name is Schultz. I wanna see Mr. Brand. The old one. - Well... - I'm Mr. Brand's secretary. Come with me, Mr. Schultz. Come in, Mr. Shultz. - Sit down, Mr. Schultz. - Thanks. Now, what can I do for you? I don't want to talk to you, I want to talk to your boss. Well, I'm Mr. Brand's personal secretary and I take care of everything for him. Then take care of these. His grandson's IOUs, $5.000 worth. Well, you just leave them with me and I'll take care of them for you. Not so fast, sister! Where's the dough? I'll bring it to your office tomorrow. I don't know about that. Maybe I'd better see Mr. Brand personal. No, I'll be there and I'll have the $5.000, really I will. Aesop says, where there's a will there's a way. I don't care who you get it from, but bring it in cash. Yes, Mr. Schultz. I hope Aesop knows what he's talking about. - Jenny, Jenny! - Oh, you scared me. Shhh! I've been in an accident. We ran down a man. I don't know how badly he's hurt. - Oh, Sylvia. - I was with Dennis. - Oh, Sylvia. - I was seeing him for the last time. After the accident people gathered around the car. There was an attorney who took charge of everything. He promised not to notify the police. He wanted our names, of course, and... And I couldn't give mine, so I... I told him I was Jenny Swanson. - Oh, Sylvia. - It isn't only because of Ronnie, Jenny. Olaf would cut me off without a cent... if he knew I'd been out with Dennis just before I was to be married. You must help me, Jenny. Now, Dennis is waiting in the greenhouse. He has the hat and coat I wore tonight. You put them on, come in the front way, ring the bell so Jeffers will see you. Tell him... tell him you lost your key. Dennis is in the greenhouse with your hat and coat... Jeffers will... I'll do it for $5.000. - But that's blackmail. - It is. Wait a minute. Yes! Yes, I want $5.000. Why, you dirty little cheat. I suppose I have no choice in the matter. I'll give it to you out of my allowance. Some each week. Oh, no. No, I need it right away. All right, I'll give you a check. Thanks. Change coats. Anything else? No. Except I think you're a coward. Any man is who's in love with a girl and won't fight for her. I wish it were simple as all that. Up with your hands! On your feet! What are you doing here at this time of night? Well, I... I was just picking some flowers. Flowers last longer if you pick them at night. Jenny, stop picking those orchids! - Professor Ronnie! - Yes, Professor Ronnie. Jenny, I saw a man leaving here. What are you up to? Well, everybody's been so nice to me... I thought it would be fun to surprise them with orchids on the table in the morning. Everybody likes orchids and I thought of it before I went to bed. - You're lying, aren't you? - Yes, Professor. Jenny, who was that man in here with you? - Dennis. - Dennis? Why, that's Jeffer's son. Well, I haven't been feeling very well and he's a doctor, you know. Only he isn't a doctor yet for a few days... and while he's waiting for his license he told me to come to the greenhouse... and he'd diagnose me for nothing. You're lying again, aren't you? Yes, Professor Ronnie. Jenny, isn't it possible for you to tell the truth? No... but I wish you'd believe me. How can I? Good heavens, when I told you to steer clear of Tom... that wasn't a signal to go after every other male in sight. You... You don't seem to know the difference between right and wrong, Jenny. You haven't any moral sense. I'd be a much happier man if I'd never met you. Why, Professor Ronnie? Oh! Jenny, we used to talk things over. We used to confide in each other. Won't you tell me what's going on? Oh, I'm sorry, but there are some things you just can't tell. Jenny, have you lost your flutter? Oh, no, I'm fluttering something awful right now. Oh, come on, I'll take you back to the house. Oh, no, I have to go back alone. You wouldn't want Jeffers to see us come in together, would you? He might misunderstand. Professor Ronnie. There's a new moon. Look over your left shoulder and make a wish. There's only one thing I wish. I wish you were back in Maple Leaf, Minnesota. It's a funny thing, but that's my wish too. That's a silly way to walk. Step on it. I want to get this over. It's my party anyway, and you're hogging it. All a waste of time. Make it snappy, huh? That was splendid. I don't think we'll have to rehearse anymore. Good! Open those doors. My party's starting. Promenade the hall! You go there and I go here! Take your girly to a nice, soft chair! Energetic old bastard, isn't he? I won't mind having an ocean between us... when he finds out that I'm marrying into his family. What do you mean? I mean that Caroline and I are ready to sail. But don't say bon voyage in a loud voice. This is supposed to be a very secret elopement. - Paul, you mustn't do it. - Well, we can try. But you don't love Caroline. Oh, no, I can't let you elope. But Jenny, I didn't think you cared. Oh, I do. Yes, I do. I care very much. I want to talk to you. You go out in the terrace. I'll be right out there. Jeffers. This is very important. Tell Mrs. Brand she's wanted on the terrace right away, will you? - And don't tell her I sent you. - Oh, no. - And ask her to hurry. - Yes, miss. - Paul, how could you do this to me? - Huh? If it's the difference in our age, don't let that bother you. - What is this? - Oh, don't pretend. It's to late for that now. What do you want out of life, love or money? Oh, how could you plan to go away without me? Have you forgotten the days when I was your dewy wild flower? I didn't know you felt this way? Oh, I do. And you do love me, don't you, Paul? Jenny, if I could afford to marry for love. I wouldn't be parting with that loose-leafed cabbage. - Paul... - Darling, I'm not worth it. I've made a mess of my life and I won't drag you into it. Oh, but at least promise me you won't marry Caroline. You were cut out for finer things. You mean you'd marry me after all I've done? Love is all that counts, Paul. You're right! Money isn't everything. Well! I must say! Caroline! It's you! You might as well know the truth. Here are your tickets. Jenny! Jenny, come here! Tom! Now quiet! Quiet, everybody! I've got an important announcement to make. Jenny here is going to marry my grandson Tom. It's the union of two old Swedish families. - How could you keep it secret from us? - Congratulations, Tom. - She'll make a beautiful bride. - Thanks, old man. Go ahead, old fellow, it's your last chance to kiss my bride. Hey, who's drunk, you or me? Ronnie! Ronnie, come here. It's your turn to kiss Tom's bride. I'll be right back, Tom. Say, who is she marrying anyway, huh? - Tom. - Fine. I'd like to send a telegram, please. Yes, to Miss Jenny Swanson. 1417, Larchwood Road, Long Island, N.Y. Yes, 1417. The message is: Have suffered complete nervous breakdown. Please come home... at once. I need you. Love... Aunt Helga. And I'm telling you I've got to see Olaf Brand. - But, sir... - I'm here to do him a favor... and if he doesn't see me he's going to regret it. But he's having a party! Just the same I'm going to see Olaf Brand if it's the last thing I do. - Well, you're looking right at him. - Oh, Mr. Brand... I'm sorry to disturb you but my client is a poor man... and his injuries have turned out to be quite serious. In fact, the hospital surgeon says it's a broken hip. What client, what hospital, what hip? The left hip. The young lady said after the accident that you would pay his expenses. What accident, what expenses? For the broken hip. Now, if you'll let me explain... ...in private. You see, I'm here to protect your family. If you just call them together, Mr. Brand, I'm sure we'll get it all settled quickly... and privately. Tell that family of mine to come into the library. Yes, Mr. Brand. You come with me. Now, what's all this rigamarole about hips and accidents? - Who are you? - I'm Thomas Jamison. - An ambulance chaser, eh: - Attorney, at your service. What's the matter, Jeffers? Is anything wrong? I don't know, Mrs. Brand. Mr. Brand wants the entire family in the library. Come along, Jenny, we're wanted in the library. - But Jeffers said only the family. - We're in the family now. Sit down. Jenny, Ronnie, sit down. Now, what's this story of yours? I represent Tony Molino, who was run down and injured last night... by a car leaving the Red Lion Inn. The car was driven by a man who gave us his name, Dr. Dennis Jeffers. The butler's son. We'll get to the bottom of this. Dr. Jeffers was accompanied by a young woman who promised my client... that if he would refrain from reporting the accident to the police... she would arrange for a handsome settlement. She gave your name as a guarantee, Mr. Brand. She... she what? Who was she? The young lady gave us her name, Miss Jenny Swanson. Jenny. You heard what he said, Jenny? - Is this true? - Yes. I can't believe it. We'll get to you in a minute, Jeffers. My thought was to avoid unpleasant publicity... that might involve you and your family unfavorably. Just what are you hinting at? Well, you see, they've been meeting there... and having supper together several nights recently. at the Road House. And the general impression was that they were man and wife. - My lawyer will see you tomorrow. - Very well, Mr. Brand. I'm sure I can count on you to treat my client handsomely. He's a very poor man. Good night. Jenny, I can't figure this out. Is what he said true? Were you out with Dennis last night? Yes. It's not true! Jenny was out with me last night. We went for a drive and stopped at the Red Lion Inn for a drink. - You're lying for her. - I'm not! Obviously there's been a little mix-up, but that's no reason for everyone to turn on Jenny. Why, Ronnie, you're in love with her. This is insane! You were out with Dennis... You're going to marry Tom And Ronnie is in love with you. And Paul has just proposed to her. I'll... I'll get Dennis. This is all your fault! You've come to mess up everything around here. You've ruined my whole life. - That's not true. - She's trying to ruin my life too! She even went as far as to blackmail me last night. Blackmail. Wait a moment. Blackmail means taking money. Jenny, did you take money? - Yes, I did, but... - She told me she'd been in an accident. Said she'd make up lies about Dennis and me unless I gave her $5.000 to pay the man. Oh, that's not true. If you cash the check, it'll come back from the bank. What do you mean I can't see him? He's having a most important family conference, Mr. Dayton. If you'll only wait. Wait nothing, I came a long ways to see that old double-crosser... and I haven't much time to tell him all the things I've got to say. Very well, Mr. Dayton, I'll tell him you're here. Jenny, why did you try to blackmail Sylvia? Beg your pardon, sir. Mr. Dayton and his son are outside. Shall I show them in? There you are, you old skinflint. A fine philanthropist you are letting Brand University suffer... just to keep all the glory to yourself. Hey, what's she doing in this house? She's going to marry me, that's what she's doing here. - Hello, Jenny. - Hello, Ted. - You know Jenny? - Know her? I should say I do! When she was at Brand, your university, she tried to blackmail my son. Blackmail. I may be dumb in some things, but I didn't let my son get hooked by a blackmailer. I'm sorry, it was not blackmail. Your son did propose to her. She has his letters to prove it. - Hello, Professor Brooke. - Deny that. There were no letters. I was lying. There were letters. I was a coward and Jenny protected me. But I made a mistake now I'll never make again. I lost the sweetest girl in the world. And I was afraid to face you because she was a waitress. A waitress? B-B-But what about Briarmont? I haven't any right to ask you, Jenny, but... I want to say it again. Will you marry me? Four men aren't enough. It had to be five. Jenny, weren't you at Briarmont with Sylvia? Were you a waitress? What if I am a waitress? And what if Dennis is the son of your butler? Sylvia's in love with him. Aren't you? And he's going to be a great doctor someday. I ought to say I'm sorry, Ronnie, but I know there's no reason to. Of course not! And you'll be better off. It'll be very handy having him in the family and keep her too. You won't have to pay him $100.000 a year the way you do Dr. Brown... - ...so don't be a snob. - Don't shout at me! I'm not a snob! I started life as a lumberjack. I rescued two men from the... But Jenny, I'm all mixed up. How did you happen to come to this house? I met Jenny in the train. And she brought me home because I was drunk. Stop eavesdropping! I want to tell this family just what I think of them. - Get out! Get out! - Don't go yet, Mr. Dayton. Everything is wrong with your family... is due to your own selfishness and dishonesty. What? You've been so mean to them that they're afraid to come to you for help. You've always made fun of them, and criticized them... and forced them into doing things secretly. You are to stop this! You cheat at cards! And you cheated Mr. Dayton. But you'd better give him back that option, because if you don't, someday you'll have a flutter in your stomach. I've been having flutters all my life. - Why else would I have three doctors? - You don't need a doctor for a flutter. That's just your conscience telling you what to do, only you don't pay any attention to it. Now there's a smart girl, you'd better listen to her, Olaf. I'll listen to her. But I'll double-cross you. I'll give that land to the university myself. How about it, Jenny, will you marry me? Get out! I don't know who she's going to marry but it's going to be somebody in my family! Now get out! Get out! This is all very fine. But what about that $5.000 you blackmailed out of Sylvia? - It was blackmail, all right. - You see? You see, I told you! Stop! Stop! I needed the money to buy back Tom's IOUs. He owed the money to Shultz the gambler... and it's your own fault Tom didn't tell you so himself. Every time he turned around you tried to disinherit him. Jenny, you did that for me. Telegram, Miss Swanson. - Jeffers, uh... - Yes, sir? What do you think of the idea of your son... marrying my granddaughter? Well, Miss Sylvia is a little wild, sir. But Dennis is the right man for her. That's all I wanted to know. Dennis, it will be so nice having a doctor in the family. But I must insist that your first child should be a girl. Only I don't think she should go to Briarmont. Now you're talking, grandma! Grandma? Why, of course, that's right. Come along, Sylvia. Come along, dear. Wait just a moment. This telegram concerns everyone, it's... from Jenny's Aunt Helga. She says, uh... "Dear Jenny, Letter recieved. Stop. No place for sweet innocent girl. Insist you leave at once. Don't worry about Tom. He's young and with that profile he's got a great future. Although you described the professor in glowing terms, he sounds exceptionally stupid, never to have thought of himself as the right man for Sylvia. I've been convinced all along that he had more than an academic interest in you. In fact, it wouldn't surprise me if without the slightest encouragement he... You know what I mean. Stop." As a matter of fact, dear Jenny... England, while the climate isn't all that it should be, is very well-known for honeymoons. And it has the added advantage of being just across the channel from Paris. But Jenny, before we sail, you must promise me a few things. Yes, Professor Ronnie. Come along, Tom. I've had a hard day. Let's duck this party. Let's go out and paint the town red. Subtitles: Lu?s Filipe Bernardes
