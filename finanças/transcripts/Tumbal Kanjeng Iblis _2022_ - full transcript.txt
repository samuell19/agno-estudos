Counting from today, it's only two weeks away. I'll let you know when the day is near. [singing in javanese] Psst. I thought I told you. No more new female tenants in this residence. She came out of nowhere. I don't care how, just make her uncomfortable so she'll leave this place. Miss Tia. Have a seat. So? The police used to visit us to ask questions.

What are you looking for? Putri. Putri? My sister. What happened to her? She's been missing for two years without a trace. Do you know her? For the past two years, she visited me in my dreams. I know it's hard to believe, but ever since I came here, she doesn't visit me anymore. Instead, I keep dreaming of my dad. As if he was here. As if he's connected to this place. Here. This is my dad. I saved my number here. Call me if something happens or if you need anything. I think I recognize that girl. Tia. Something about her just... makes me deeply troubled. Whoever she is you should remember our goal. Kanjeng sent her to us so that we can perfect our child. Don't lecture me about that. Yes. Nathan. He keeps acting up. He influenced Janu to do what he asked. If you'd agree, I will find a way to bring him down. Just take care of Janu. Let me take care of Nathan. Nathan is Kanjeng's favorite child. Don't act too rashly, okay? THE CURSE STARTS FROM HERE. LEAVE THIS PLACE IMMEDIATELY. -N Nina. Nina. THE CURSE STARTS FROM HERE. LEAVE THIS PLACE IMMEDIATELY. -N Here it is, Sir. The symbol on this person's back is exactly the same with this one. This is that symbol. The symbol of devotion to Kanjeng Iblis. I did a research on this years ago. They've been performing this ritual since the eighth century. To live a long live. To become wealthy. Ageless. You know... the punishment for interfering with Kanjeng's order, right? As far as I know, this cult is very secretive. Once they are in, they can never get out. Except by dying, or living in a state of perpetual damnation. This wound will atone for your guilt. Whoever this person is, they must have been connected with Kanjeng Iblis herself. Your suspicions regarding the cases of the missing students in the past few years, could be true. Because their ritual requires sacrifices. This is a recording of spells. One of them is Kanjeng Iblis's devotion spell. It was the last material I researched. Nina. The closer you get, someone will feel disturbed by your attempt. I'm worried... that they will hunt you down. - Jan, pa, ji, ro - Jan.. pa.. ji.. ro.. Lir, ba, pu. Lir, ba, pu? Sirep. Sirep. Sirep. Sirep. Pick up, Tia! Hello. - Hello, Tia! - Nina. The picture you just gave me. - What? - Your father... Sirep. Hello? Tia? Sirep. Sirep. Sirep. Sirep. The house is so big. We put up the rooms in the back for rent. - That looks heavy, let me carry it. - You don't have to, Ma'am. It's okay. You must be tired. Not at all. Ms. Rosa, thank you. Not many people would hire a pregnant woman. We gladly welcome you. Is it a boy or a girl? Careful. It's a girl, Ma'am. A girl? How far along are you? Five months, Ma'am. I see, five months. Let's get inside, then. The night wind is bad for a pregnant lady. - Thank you, Ma'am. - Go get some rest. Come inside and turn left. Hi. Where are you going this late at night with a backpack? I was going to see my cousin, Ma'am. What about now? Now, I'm going back inside because she just canceled. All right, then. Have a good rest. Excuse me. - Go ahead. - Thank you. Nina! For our child. My Dear. Come here, Dear. All clean. It's done. Thank you, Dear. USISI CAMPUS, SAPUTRI KINANTI WARNING LATTER Look what I got. Come on, Dear. Take it. Soon, you'll be like Nathan. You... can play outside. You won't have to stay in the dark. Our child is within our control. We can forward the ritual. After we've recovered... we can start the refinement ritual. Ms. Rosa's annual event is forwarded. You must leave this house. You can come back the day after tomorrow. - Hello. - Hello. Good evening, Tia. Sorry, we just want to let you know that Mr. Yusuf is constantly hysterical. He keeps calling out your name. How is he now? His condition continues to decline. His wounds are getting worse. We've tried every possible treatment. His wounds are invested by maggots now. We don't know where they come from. Follow me. I told you to leave this place, why haven't you left? Why are you still here? Who are you? Nathan. Nathan? What do you know about the curse? Watch your words. Everyone here are all ears. Then, why are you telling me to leave? I know... you came here to look for your sister. Putri. An old man must have brought you to this place. You sure this is the building? Just like what he did to Putri. If you're looking for a place to rent, there are a lot of them nearby. Some are close to the campus. You want me to help you look? Excuse me, any vacant rooms? Most likely. You can talk to the owner. Where is Putri now? She died. They made her a sacrifice. Just like what they're going to do to Nina. You might end up the same... if you don't leave this place soon. Dad did the right thing. To leave this place. Dad? Get away from her if you want to be alive. How do you know about Dad? I failed to save Putri. I can't fail you, too. Help me, Tia. Tia. Help. Help me. Putri. Help! Help me, Tia! Help! Help me, Tia! You family owes me. GET AWAY FROM HERE. IGNORE THE DREAMS. Find your family. Mineral water! Mineral water! Come get your drinks! Water, Miss. Come get your drinks! Water? Come get your drinks! GET AWAY FROM HERE. IGNORE THE DREAMS. Time for all of you to leave! The whole family is gathering soon. Everyone, leave! Leave! Leave! Nina! OBEDIENCE DEPENDENCY DEAL, WEALTH, LOYALTY DEAL WITH THE DEVIL WOMEN SACRIFICES THERE ARE DEVILS THAT TAKE THE FORM OF DEMONS AND HUMANS PUNISHMENT FOR THOSE WHO VIOLATE THE AGREEMENT CURSES THAT ARE PASSED DOWN ROSA AND YUSUF = NATHAN ROSA AND JEFRI = ABDI Kanjeng had given you life. And you betrayed her! This devil's chain must be broken. You... You... your husband, and that devil's child... should burn in hell! [singing in javanese] Jan, pa, ji, ro, lir, ba, pu. Jan pa ji ro lir ba pu. [chanting spell] [chanting spell] [chanting continues] Kanjeng. I ask for your wisdom. We're doing this ritual ahead of the time that you've decided. Accept our offering. Now I understand the reason Nathan wants to save you. Yusuf... Should've not left this place. Your mother, Putri, and you, Tia, are suffering because of that hypocrite's nonsense. Rosa. Enough. Enough. My son. Dear. Tonight, Kanjeng will get two perfect sacrifices. One for us, and one for you, Abdi. All of Yusuf's offspring must die. Sirep. Sirep. Sirep. Sirep. Sirep. Sirep. Sirep. Sirep. Sirep. Our plan is to not let Tia go again. Yes. I will talk to Tia. You'll take care of it inside. Don't fail. What is this? Shut up. Shut up. Look at me. Shut up! You're really stubborn. I told you to leave this place. Why did you come back? I warned you. So what happened to Putri won't happen to you. Why did you come back? I will take care of what happened in this place. Is it all cleaned up, Janu? Make sure it is all taken care of. - The extended family is coming. - Yes. I am Rosa and Yusuf's son. The result of their ritual with Kanjeng that was perfected at the cost of many people's lives. This is a devil's chain. Now, they're going to do it again. For their son. I have another task for you when you're done. Free him immediately. Janu. Free Nathan from this curse. Janu. Janu, help us. Janu. Please let us go, Janu. Let me go, Janu. Janu, no. No, no, no, Janu! It's not my job to explain everything. Nathan. - No, Janu, please. - If you want to know, he will come and ask for you. Janu. Janu, no. Janu, please! What's wrong? Rosa. Nathan. Something's happened to Nathan. It's okay. Hold on. Hold on, Dear. The relatives are coming. We have to finish this soon. There's still a ritual for Tia. Hold on. Hold on, okay? Hold on. Nathan! [singing in javanese] Janu! [singing in javanese] I guided you here. I was also the one who took Putri, your sister, to come here. How unfortunate, though, she refused the honors we offered her. Both of you are already bound to Kanjeng Iblis. It all started with your father. Your father was the most loyal servant. The one that Kanjeng favored. When they were young, Yusuf and Rosa made a pact with Kanjeng Iblis and formed a new sect to obtain wealth and perfection. Rosa became greedy and sacrificed so many young girls. Where are you going? You should've thanked me! No! - Why? - What should I thank you for? - Why? - No! - What do you want? - How many have you killed? - Our child! - What child? Look at me, look at me. Your father didn't like that. Your father left Rosa. Yusuf wanted to be normal. To turn back time, to love, and grow old with your mother. But, leaving Kanjeng only made him suffer because of the curse. And that curse will follow all of his offspring. Until your sister who'd turned 20 finally became a sacrifice. You are Yusuf's daughter. The most beloved servant. You can change that fate. You can also be a reformer of Kanjeng Iblis' sect. Jan. Pa. Ji. Ro. Lir. Ba, pu Sirep. Sirep. Sirep. [chanting spell continues] My dear, you're the only one I have. Don't do it. Don't do it, Tia. Tia. Don't do it. Don't do it. Please don't do it, Sweetie. Tia. Don't do it, Tia! Tia! Don't! [singing in javanese] Jan. Pa. Ji. Ro. Lir. Ba, pu [chanting spell] [chanting sepll] Kanjeng. Honor us! [chanting spell continous] Traitors! Kanjeng. We offer you what you really want. No! Tia! Tia! No! Kanjeng, don't! You evil woman! Curse you! I am your master! Me! [chanting spell] Excuse me. - Are there any vacancies? - We do. - Can I take a look? - Of course. - Janu. - Yes. - Take her. - Okay. Come with me. Please wait here, I'll get the madam. Hi. - I'm Tia. - Airin. Come. You must be really tired. - Are you in college? - Yes, I'm just starting. Where? USISI. A lot of people go there here. Most people who live here do. I hope you'll like it. We happen to have a room left. What do you think? - It's pretty big! - Go ahead. Have a look.
