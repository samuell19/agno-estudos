The plasma injector again. You said you'd fixed it. I did fix it. Doesn't seem very fixed. Hang on. Mandatory fix. You having problems over there? Negative, Gray leader. Just a few bumps, nothing to worry about. If you could just flutter the injector a bit. The plasma core connection's a little fuzzy. Aw yeah, that works. Did you hit it? I definitely didn't. This is commander Gemini squadron. Comms check, report in. Starting with you, Sol. Yeah, I know, lead gunner with you as always. Gray two checking in. Gray two gunner, standing by.

Access codes are zero, alpha, November, beta, four. Beta four. Transmitting the Admiral's briefing June squadron, Colonel Danforth, XO on the Valiant and acting as liaison for. We're proud to have your Gemini unit with us here today. Coming from our reserves, this situation may seem a little nerve wracking, - but we stand at... - No, no. A turning point. A chance to finally gain some much needed ground and bring this terrible, terrible war to an end. By now, your blood is pumping and you're ready for a fight, but, afraid I must disappoint. Upon arrival you will hold position in the vicinity of the Arabus system. Once we have gained superiority over the sector, our stellar comness will begin to judge the atmosphere on Arabus, providing us with the opportunity to push this wretched war a good distance from Terra prime. We anticipate the assault to be moderately brief. We're looking at a donkey's gallop. Short and sweet. Should be coming to a conclusion by the time you arrive, but precautions in place in case there is a delay, primarily, as I'm sure you've noticed, the life support in your flight suits has been increased to 80 hours. The downside of this of course, is that you will be required to assess the stellar colonists for quite some time after we are finished resting up. Apologies. I thank you. And I look forward to meeting you in person once this little skirmish has been concluded. Transmitting holding coordinates. Let me know if you don't get 'em. Does that mean we won't be fighting? I want those comms clear, gray five. - Yeah, but just... - Stop talking. Of course that means we're not fighting. - What am I... - Shut up everyone. Okay guys, we're a few minutes away, a little conversation calms the nerves. Gray Leader, thank you for undermining me. - Oh! - Seriously? - Never even crossed my mind. - No gravitas, gravitas. - I always liked you. - Thank you. All fighters, assume attack coordinates for VL drop. We'll hit the initial point at approximately six minutes. Six minutes from home to hell. 80 hours, hope you took your anti piss pills, buddy. I'm getting old, I had to take two. Um, I've got a problem here. Yeah, I can see it. Plasma core connection's a little fuzzy. It should hold if you flip to the injector a bit. I'll look at it again when we get back. Copy that. Oh, no, no, don't get me started, okay? We've been robbed of a major tactical advantage here and it's bullshit. Ballistic weaponry was, no, is the best. Okay, it's consistently more effective than plasma bursts. Hey, hey, hey, you're talking out your league here, boy. He's got a point, I prefer ballistics. Who cares? We're not gonna be doing any fighting. , you want me to get too close or anything, watch your trigger finger, mate. You really knocked down about missing out on the opportunity to get these things back for Europe, New York, Istanbul. Quebec. You want me to shut that off? I wanna rain down fire on 'em. Good. I wanna 'kill 'em as slowly as they killed us. I wanna see if their skin melts as slowly as ours does. I remember this one picture of a dog from Quebec. It fused with the family that were huddled over it and they'd all become this rotten, stinking... ...thing, with this silent scream expression. It was horrible. Sorry. It's all right, he doesn't know I was there. Nobody does. Comms are still functioning. Let's just show these guys off for now. Approaching target. I'm not receiving any info from the relay network. What do you think? Maybe one of them's down. Plasma injectors fired up and ready to roll. Approach vector green. Arriving at initial point, standby. Cutting the L drive in five... four... three, two, one. Whoa! Okay? - They're all behind you! - I can't take them! No, no! We are taking a beating. Gemini squadron, standing... Gemini unit, hold position! Stand by for combat instructions. I see them on me, they're right up on me they're coming in fast. All three,. Help me clear up those channels. What's that? It's one of them. Is it dead? Yeah, it's dead. Mercy now. Hello big fella. Pardon my French. I've never seen one of them up close but that thing... Huge. They still look human. They ripped the teeth out of prisoners. As trophies. You okay? Yeah. Systems check. Gunners at levels to 2.4. Looks like you're finally gonna get that action you wanted. I changed my mind. Can you stop breathing like that? Sorry. We got this, all right. Found something, patch me in. Gemini group, change comms frequency to delta 08701. Keep formation tight and focused on the work in front of you. Gemini units, do you copy? - Yes, Colonel. - Move to holding sector, echo gamma 4-7 and engage enemy cruisers. They're using a new shield frequency. It absorbs plasma more efficiently than previously encountered. Get somebody on the ventral batteries! I can see a red light, ventral batteries! If you have ballistics, use them. We are not equipped with ballistics. If you can provide any support then we can... Negative, we're tied up with our own sectors. You can punch through their defenses but it takes a number of precise hits to the dorsal shield generator. It can be done but you have to commit to your target. Commit to your targets. We're counting on you. Do what you can and if you're hit, make the most of it. Yes, sir. all units are stormed, enemy cruisers are... Coordinates have been transmitted. Gray seven, gray five, you're with me. I'm with you Gray Leader. Let's move, flight. Targets acquired. I can't see them. Six cruisers, dead ahead. Just crossing into sector four seven. There they are. How many turrets do those things carry? Just three, they're heavy duty cruisers. So, lots of fire power. If it gets through it's gonna head straight for Mustel's command ship. Coming up, you two. Okay, flight, pair up. We'll take the leader. Gray three and gray six, you can take the rear cruiser. Gray two and gray four, you can have your pick from any of the ones in the middle Copy, gray leader. Dealer's choice. You point us, I'll shoot. Weapons three, let's do this. 10-5, come in? Gray six, are you in position? I'm right with you, gray three. - Gray five! - Stay in formation! - What are you doing? - Stay in formation. It's hot! Gray five, get back in formation! Geeze! Help me! Help me! Get it off of me! Get it off! Help me! Don't let them slip you from your coordinates, pick your targets. Watch each other's backs, calm and careful. We ready? Ready, boss. Okay, flight, bring 'em up! It's hot. Regroup and start your attack runs. Target acquired, tone and lock, weapons free. Target lock confirmed. Gray six, fire on my mark. Mark. Come, come on. This isn't working. This isn't working! Left one strafing, we'll stamp out! You sure? You heard me! Setting to rapid fire. Negative! Do not alter your weapons settings. Let's go! Keep targeting their starboard power cell. I'm coming 'round for another pass. Target locked. Oh, come on! One, two... Oh, oh! Good work, Hawthorn! It's tough going, but keep at it. Dead force instructions were on point. Gray four, pull in. I'm right with you, gray two, coming in. Watch it, gray two, they're throwing everything at you guys. Morris, we're hit! Oh, f... I'm making a run once we have some breathing room. - What about Sousie... - Don't think about it. I'm bringing us around again. I'm all used up, I can't... What is it? I see it! I'm hit, I'm hit, I'm hit! This is a lost cause, guys. I dunno, I dunno, Yaren, what do you think? Yaren? Yaren, gray six! Gray six, can you hear me, Yaren? Hazel! I'm going in. Jim. I know, I know, shut up. Starboard power source targeted. I'm losing her, no... It's too hot, we're gonna get killed, Yaren! This is suicide! Come on, get us the fuck out! We tried!

I think we're out of transmission range. It just won't reach anyone, I can't speak to anyone. I can't get... Okay. It's all right, it's all right, it's all right. Is that better, does that help, yeah? Okay, okay. How is that, is that better? We just wait now, just wait. Here. Can I give you one of these? Another one to put you under. It's the same.

Get this on, keep it on, hey, don't! - Stop it! - Ow! Stuff in range. Easy, easy. There's something out there. There is something out there. Easy, easy. - If I take us... - We need to get home. Yes, we're getting home. Here, here. You have it. Shit. There's a ship. It's in one piece. But it's right off. I managed to get the power back up but the engine's shot. The plasma coil's damaged, of course. Fine. Think so, you...? I think so. And we need another plasma injector. You, you. Fix. There's no need to fix it now. The security's still out there, they're still fighting up there and when they're done, someone's gonna come and get us. Hazel! Nobody's coming. No reach. They'll find us. Stupid! It's sunup in a few hours, I'll go and... I'll go and look at the ship and see what, but I... I can, I can plug the breach in your section. Even if I fix it, can you fly? You have to fly. I haven't flown in that sort of thing. I could. I can't. I can't. You have to. Don't leave me alone. Just hang in there. I've still got last of this sedative, so we may as well wait a while. Hey. The engines are fine. Plasma core is bent but I managed to... I need a transducer and a modulator for the busted plasma coil and there isn't anything I can use so we're stuck here. There's a ship that came down came down last night. Isn't one of ours. I think this was by design on the comms. It's a direct cruiser. They will lend us their plasma injector and we can go home.
