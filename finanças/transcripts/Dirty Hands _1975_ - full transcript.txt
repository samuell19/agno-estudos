Sorry, uh... - Did you want your kite? - Yes. - Come and get it. - Thank you. Is there anything else you want? INNOCENTS WITH DIRTY HANDS Louis, I want you to meet Jeff Marlo. He's a writer ...he rents the little blue house and flies a kite. Yes, I saw you swimming this morning. I swim a lot. Ah, I'm sure you do. Would you like a drink? - I've got one, thanks - OK So, I'll take care of myself. I suppose that my... ...charming wife told you I drink a lot! To your health. How horrible. Why are you laughing? Why not? You can't imagine... what it feels like.. ...suddenly, it's like your heart explodes... ...and then, everything is black... ...and you die. So, why drink, it's not very clever No, no, it's got nothing to do with being clever... ...or intelligent... But it has everything to do with: Pain! Anyway... Soon I'll take my ... ...marvelous wife, ...somewhere, anywhere... to America or Martinique, we'll see... Come here, come on, come, come, come... ...come come, closer.. ...come here, please... Listen, I have a few questions to ask you, Julie... ... first: why can't we make love any more... ...next, why don't you ever kiss me? ...next, why do you refuse to Let me touch you?... ...and, do you hate me? Stop drinking.. ... It's too stupid. Louis, I beg you. Why do you put yourself in such a state? That's a good question... ...That's what I call a very good question! - Does he do this often? - Yes Help me, I'm going to put him to bed. He's crazy. NO. Don't touch it. Don't touch the belt, help me. What's going on? It's nothing Louis. Go to bed. - How can you stand it? - I can't. I've had enough. He hasn't touched me since his heart attack. He sold his business and we settled here. Now he wants us to go to Martinique. He probably wants to replace his whiskey with rum. He'll never get there alive. He won't hold up very long at this pace. Why did you marry him? He's at least 1 5 years older than you. Eighteen. He was very kind to me... ... I was supposed to do a film and he financed it. You were an actress? I was starting out, I didn't really want much. Anyway... ....he was really very nice ... ... not great in bed, but nice... So, let's talk about you, what do you do besides fly kites? - I write stupid shit. - What? I'm a writer. I type because I can't read my handwriting... ...but I have no talent, I'm lazy... ...and I'm easily bored. Bastard! ... I'm easily bored but you excite me.... Bastard. He won't be around much longer, take my word for it. He won't last long. THREE WEEKS LATER - Are you Madam Wormser? - Yes, I am. - Your car is here. - Don't you want to see it? But are you sure you're not mistaken? Mr. Wormser came by the garage... - I'm a little late. Hope you like the car. - Goodbye, thank you. - You're crazy. This car!! - Do you like it? Of course I like it, it's my dream. - Thank you. - No no no! Thank you ... Thank you for putting up with me. It's to compensate... Go on, go try it out. No not today. Too much traffic. I'm just going to look at it. You've deserve it. Me, I think I deserve a drink. Don't move. I'll get it for you. I love you! Thank you. I've been restless lately... and I want to move, to go... - ...do you understand? - Yes. It's true, I drink too much. And afterward I feel.. ...so tired... too tired. Sorry... I talk too much. I better go to bed, good night. Good night. Good night, Louis. Good night, Julie. This old guy is off to bed. Jeff, please, Jeff, stay with me. Don't go, I beg you... ... I beg you, please, Jeff, don't leave me alone. - No. We're already behind schedule. - Jeff! No, we can't see each other for 3 or 4 days. Not even phone each other. Maybe I'll just leave a few days, until... the accident becomes official huh? I'll let you know one way or the other. You must really... Yes, yes. He could wake up. Think about what I'll have to do. I'll have to stay alone with him all night. Can't you come back sooner? God, you know we can't. We have to have Mother Chauvinet as an alibi. No one can even suspect that were in this together. It's 1 1 :30 . In 2 hours, in 2 hours... The thing is on the corner of his desk... ...anyhow, I'm leaving. See you later. I killed him. The car! Darllng, l took the Datsun. After thls lntermlnable nlght... ...l don't have the courage to go see the cops rlght away. l'll brlng the car back ln 2 or 3 days. You'll just need to explaln... ...that l had to go to ltaly to do research for my novel... ...and slnce l had no money, Louls lnslsted... ... l borrow the car... Everythlng went as planned. l'm certaln that Mother Chauvlnet ls ready to swear... ... that l dldn't leave the house and worked all nlght... lf you want to joln me, wrlte me at my P.O. box ln Menton. l'll check lt tomorrow and the day after. l'll be back before the beglnnlng of the lnvestlgatlon, lf there ls one. But afterwards, lt'll be just the two of us. - The maritime police? - Ah yes! We've decided to investigate, Mrs. Wormser. Oh! What's going on? We were just going to take the helicopter out. I'm probably worrying for nothing. But he's always so punctual... Thank you Must be the salt air, my underwear is itching. Yes - Madam. - Gentlemen. Madam Wormser? I'm Inspector Villon, from Draguignan. - Please come in. - Excuse me, Madam. Didn't we meet at the Mayor's Reception? That's it, yes, let me introduce you to Inspector Lamy, from Paris. I took the liberty of asking him to come along. Hope you don't mind, Madam. I'm on vacation here and Villon, my colleague, has requested... - Please gentlemen, sit down. - Thank you Madam Well, Mrs. Wormser We received a phone call from the Maritime Police. Yes? They have, uh, they have found Mr. Wormser's boat But no one was on board. What's that? Oh no!! The divers searched for over an hour with no results. And you think that... Excuse me, would you like to drink something? -No. -Thank you Madam. Please. We understand what you're going through, Madam. I'm terribly frightened. Mr. Wormser perhaps went aboard another boat... ...to say hello to friends. Oh, that's very unlikely madam. We are going to inspect the boat. We wondered if... ...you'd like to go with us. Ah, well, I don't know... I... Ah, you'd rather wait here for your husband to call... ...to tell you where he is? You know, I'm beginning... I'm beginning to fear that he won't be able to. Ah, we realize how you feel, Madam. There is perhaps a very simple explanation for this disappearance. But, my colleague is forced to ask you a few questions... ...that you might find indiscreet. I don't know how I can help you gentlemen, but I will tell you everything you wish to know. Yes well, do you know if your husband has enemies, madam? Enemies? No, certainly not. He's a very kind man, very peaceful. He retired. He wanted to live here. And where did you dock your boat Madam? In the harbor? No... We had a dock at the foot of the cliff. - Could I trouble you for a glass of water - Of course - No don't get up. - It's this way excuse me - You'll find glasses by the sink. - Ah thank you Tell me, it's quite a climb up from the dock, isn't it? Yes it's why we were thinking of moving. Ah, but you would stay in St.Tropez? I didn't know my husband was considering the Antilles. I've heard it's a marvelous place. You know, nothing was really decided. Tell me, do you see your neighbors much? No... but last night we had a visitor, Jeff Marlo. He often comes to see Louis. He came to dinner. Ah and is he a neighbor? Yes he lives just two houses below us. He's a writer. - Yes, they developed a friendship - Ah... Yes, yes, yes. Perhaps, he could see your husband's boat? Well, we'll go pay him a visit. Oh, I don't believe it will be worthwhile. He told us last night he was going to Italy. He was leaving very early this morning. Well, anyhow, we'll go and make sure. No I'm quite sure he left. He took one of our cars, the Datsun. Oh, he did? Did you lend it to him? Yes, well ... My husband did. Mr. Marlo has no car and we knew that he has very limited means... He was planning on going for 2 or 3 days to... huh... ...ah yes, he wanted to gather material for the book he's writing. So, my husband lent him the car to save him money. And he accepted? Well, yes, Louis insisted. You say Mr. Marlo lives two houses from here? Who owns the other? Mrs. Chauvinet, an elderly lady. Has she visited you lately? No, I rarely see her. I'm afraid. Of what madam? I think that Louis had another heart attack. ... and he must have fallen overboard... He had a heart attack last year. Yes, it is plausible. Ah yes, effectively, yes. One last question Madam, if you'll allow me. Did your husband often keep large sums of money on him... ...or on the boat? Ah yes, I see that's interesting. Did he have a lot of money on him? No, I don't believe so, no. ... I'm sure he didn't. - So? - Well, let's see... ... according to this Madam Chauvinot.. ...it seems he was home all night, typing. Although, she did sleep a little so it's not a perfect alibi. And also she saw Mr. Wormser go out with a big bag of some sort. ...Around five in the morning. This woman must spend her whole life at the window. She has insomnia. I think she's a bit of a drinker. She's rather funny. Can't smoke on board, Inspector. Say, on the subject of drinking... ... I don't think that the Wormsers were teetotalers. The trash can is full of whiskey bottles. How'd you find out? By getting thirsty at the right time. We've checked everything, there is nothing suspicious. Well, let's see about that. What's in here? The head. One could say this is a well kept boat, it looks like it's never been used. Yes, a little too much so. It looks like Wormser didn't do a lot of fishing. - There's no bait. - Maybe on the deck. Hey, officer, wasn't there any bait? Bait? No, say that's true, there was no bait. - Alexander, can you come see? - What is it? - A spot of blood, look here. - Ah yes. Let's have it analyzed and dusted for prints. Well, I don't think we'll find anything else. Say, I wouldn't mind a drink. Say, I suppose that confirms the story of the heart attack. What? The blood stain? Yes. He headed out to do some fishing... ... dropped anchor, heart attack. He collapsed, hit his head and passed overboard. Not too complicated. Yes, but several things bother me. The lack of bait, the whiskey bottles. The wife is young and pretty. Seems hot to trot. The neighbor borrowed the car. You know, I think you've got something there. Still, I like your idea there. Wormser was an alcoholic. His wife and that guy kept him drunk... Then, knock him off to live happily ever after with his money. Yes, but if the writer is involved... why did he borrow the car? That wasn't smart! Maybe he just got scared. We've got to find this Marlo, interrogate him. I'm going to call the police station. Then we'll have that drink. Julle darllng, lt's so stupld, forgot to warn you about the money belt. lt was full of bllls and jewels. l'll put lt ln a safe place untll l get back ln a day or two. Everythlng went well, just llke l sald. He came on board and gave me a bloody nose. That's all he was able to do. Wrlte me as soon as you can and tell me everythlng. P.O. box Menton. l love you. Jeff, my love, my darllng... Everythlng ls golng well. The pollce came to see me... ...but they don't suspect a thlng. Hurry back, please. l'm golng crazy wlthout you. l love you, l love you, Julle. Hello sir. - Have a seat. - Thank you. I would like the balance in my husband's account, Mr. Wormser Certainly, Mrs. Wormser. I assume it's a joint account? No, it's in his name. Ah, we can only give this information to the titled owner. Of course, I understand. But... something terrible has happened. Yes I know. News travels very fast, you know. I think we could bend the rule just a little... I believe your husband made a recent withdrawal. Excuse me. Yes, it was yesterday actually. How much did he withdraw? A rather large sum; a million and a half. 1 50 million old francs. But, that's impossible. Well, we were surprised but it's a fact. And... what is left in the account? Oh, 92 francs. We had to notify him this is below the minimum. Aren't you feeling well, madam? - Yes, please excuse me. - Good day Mrs. Wormser. Mrs. Wormser... - Hello Mrs. Wormser. - Gentlemen. This is a happy coincidence Madam. Yes, we received permission to open your husband's safety deposit box. You're welcome to join us. I'm at your disposal. You are very cooperative, Madam. We appreciate it Mr. Wormser was here recently. He apparently took everything. I'm happy you're here, Julie. You see I am so distraught. Since yesterday, I feel like I'm in a waking nightmare. Poor Julie. Ah, it really is incomprehensible. Georges, I had thought maybe Louis told you his plans. You were much more than a financial advisor to him. Don't speak about him in the past, Julie... In the past? I'm sorry to see you in this state. You know I'm very fond of you both. There, there, I'm sure everything wiII be explained, go on and eat. - I'm really not very hungry. - Eat anyway. Shall we have a souffle for dessert? The police came to my office this morning. They asked me the same questions you did. I told them I didn't know anything. I won't tell you exactly the same thing. In fact, he intends to leave for the Antilles as soon as possible. He'd already made all the arrangements. And you think he's left for there? Now now Julie, not without you. He adores you. No but I do believe he's put the house up for sale. Put the house up for sale? He found something in Martinique, I believe. He wanted to surprise you. Now you're talking about him in past tense. I'm concerned about leaving you alone, Julie. You're very nice George, thank you. I've got so much work right now. Anyway, if you need anything, call me. You can count on me. Thank you. I know I can count on you. You're very pretty, Julie. Dear Mrs. Wormser... - Please excuse our intrusion. - Madam Gentlemen - Mr. Thorent brought you back? - Yes. We saw his car. I suppose he told you about our visit this morning? Yes, he did. Yes well, we have some important news Madam. We saw Mr. Wormser's doctor and... ..he made some rather surprising revelations. Dr. Favart? What could he have told you? Well, he told us that your husband never suffered a heart attack. What do you mean? But.... That's right, it was an act. Mr. Wormser suffered another illness he found terribly humiliating. According to Dr. Favart, he had become impotent. And so, it was to justify his lack of passion towards you... that he invented... ...that he invented this story about the heart attack. That makes no sense. I don't believe a word. Ah, you mean to say that you had normal relations with him? Sexual relations, that is. No. So the good doctor's statement was correct. We have several rather difficult revelations ...in any case, surprising ones to tell you. Please sit down. Thank you, but I'm fine standing. Oh no, Inspector Villon is right. You'd better to sit down, believe me. We found the Datsun, Madam. It crashed into some rocks near Menton. There was neither corpse nor wounded in the car. We think the driver was thrown. Then.... ... washed out to sea. We found a sports coat in the back.... ...in it were I.D. papers with the name Joseph Marlo... ...writer, living in St. Tropez. My God, what's going on? Ah nothing very rare, I'm afraid. We checked Mr. Marlo's house, and found.... ...this, in the living room, under a cushion. This is yours, is it not? But I've never been in Mr. Marlo's house, never. A formal inquest has been started for your husband's disappearance... ... Mrs. Wormser, ...the judge is very anxious... ...to interview you as chief witness. Your lawyer sends his apologies, he will be a little late. That's not unusual for him. I don't know him. He hasn't seen you yet? A friend of my husband's asked him to defend me. From what I've seen so far he'll have to be very talented. Don't worry, he doesn't lack talent. I'm not worried sir. - Maybe you should be. - Anyway we'll see. You're very close to being indicted, Madam. I'd rather not discuss this without my lawyer. You have every right, Madam. Smoke, your Honor? No, thank you, I prefer my own. You've got nerves of steel, bravo. I hope you can keep it up. Your honor. - Counselor. - Please excuse the delay. Ah, Mrs. Wormser... They're giving you trouble, eh? Don't worry, I'm here to defend you. My name is Albert Legal. Perfect name for a lawyer, no? You know, you are ravishing. So, your honor, I know you adore torturing pretty women ..but I need to ask you to wait a few more minutes. ...because I have not yet had a chance to talk with my client alone. Is there a corner we could be alone, I promise we won't be 1 0 minutes. Your little scene doesn't impress me, but I will grant you the time. Please take Mr. Legal and his client to the back room. Thank you, your honor, I'm very grateful. You are a superb woman Yes, it'll do. And no listening at the door huh! Please sit down. You're much younger than your husband. I can't help it. Relax. I'm a little late because I went to see everyone: ...your husband's banker, your neighbor, and also...... ...the real estate agent handling the house, and of course the garage. So now the police are sure you've killed your husband... ... with the help of that guy... what's his name? Jeff Marlo. Yes, that's it. Like they say in novels, was he more than a friend? No, nothing more. You don't say his name like that of a simple friend. Be careful. Now, did he visit you often? They liked to chat together. They got along very well. They'd have a couple of drinks. Oh, don't make me laugh. Louis drank like a fish.... ...maybe he cut down a little when his heart kicked up. As soon as he felt well he began drinking again,... ...but not a great deal. Did you lead normal lives, I mean like a husband and wife? - We had separate bedrooms - Yes that's it. Now tell me about this earring, was it yours? Yes. You've never gone to his house? Yes, just once. It wasn't very smart to have lied. Tell me the whole story. Oh it was a couple of weeks ago. We hadn't seen him in some time. ..and Louis asked me to drop in and see him... ... the door was open, I went in. No one was home... ... I smoked a cigarette, waited, he never showed up. The next day, we found he was spending a few days in Italy. I see! No doubt to be seen... and he came back this week! We can't keep the judge waiting... Let me take care of everything. Just repeat in your head '' I keep my trap shut'' Do you dig, Julie? I dig, Mr. Legal. You're lucky to be so good looking... ... or I'd have dropped you like a hot potato. We weren't too long, your Honor? Please Counselor, don't start your little song and dance again. It's eventually going to get on my nerves and it won't do you any good. You don't feel you have a solid case. My only intention is justice. Oh sit down, you are making me dizzy! Please Mrs. Wormser, sit down. - I have a few questions to ask you. - Yes About what? But about Mr. Wormser's dissapearance of course! Just a second Your Honor, the police report goes quite a bit further. Yes, the police report you saw... ..concluded that Mr.Wormser was robbed and killed, Counselor. Madam Wormser has a right to know what she is suspected of. The report alleges the crime was committed by a Mr. Joseph Marlo... ..and Mrs Julie Wormser, born Schumann, was his accomplice. Well, now we know were we stand. The police report explained the following theory: Louis Wormser was dead or unconscious on his boat Monday morning. That morning the neighbor, Mrs. Marie Chauvinet, saw... ..a man pulling a big seaman's kit bag along the beach, so she says. The police report suggests it was in fact.... ..the body of Louis Wormser, and Joseph Marlo was carrying it. Marlo threw the cadaver out to sea. Then... ... he swam back to shore. He then continued to type as if he had not stopped for the whole night. Pardon me, your Honor, Mrs. Wormser needs a glass of water. - Over here? - Right. - Are you feeling better? - Yes. You're o.k.? Yes, I'm fine thanks. Please continue Your Honor. You're very gracious. Marlo took the money and whatever else he found on the boat... maybe even on the victim's body, a total of about 2 million francs, ...200 million old francs, ...and taking Mrs. Wormser's new Datsun 260... ...he fled and Mrs. Wormser was to join him later. The police report states that they were lovers. But they never met up because he was killed in a auto accident. Well... I can only compliment the police's reasoning. It is barely certain J. Marlo killed Louis Wormser. Well, I'm delighted we're in agreement. Yes certainly, from what I've learned. Jeff Marlo went out of his way to befriend Mr Wormser. He was almost broke, at the end of his rope... I suppose there is a great deal of proof of his guilt. Obviously the stolen car is one. Well, Mrs. Wormser stated, her husband loaned the car to Marlo... ....even insisting he take it. Between us that is highly unlikely. All right, fine fine. What else? Well go back to that.. The blood on board the boat. The blood? What is this story? Additional evidence. We were sure when the report became final. - This isn't a trap, is it? - Please. We're talking about a little blood on the railing. Before being killed Mr. Wormser must have fought with his assassin... ...the ''little blood'' in question is the same type as Mr. Marlo's. ...which proves Marlo was on board. What blood type is it? Type O. Not Mr.Wormser's. OK, fine, What else? We have proof Marlo mailed... ...a letter to Mrs. Wormser from Menton. Do you have the letter? No, but we know Mrs. Wormser received it... ...the day of J. Marlo's death... The Inspector is certain. The mailman saw the letter stamped Menton! What is this! A mailman who remembers the stamp of Menton!! Not Madagascar, nor Tahiti, but Menton. Oh no. You're not well, counselor? It's obvious the mailman heard of Mr. Wormser's disappearance... It's normal he was curious about his wife's mail. Fine, but nothing proves it was from J. Marlo. Do you have another idea? No, the letter was definitely from Mr. Marlo. Mrs. Wormser spoke to me of the letter... Marlo said he had seen the papers and was returning... ..because the police wanted to discuss the disappearance of the car. You're not lucky, counselor. The car was headed the opposite direction at the time of the accident. Of course, Marlo lied in the letter. He simply wanted to appease Mrs. Wormser.. ...to buy a little time. He was running. You're saying his only goal was to appease her. How do you explain this? It was found in Marlo's suit while checking the wrecked Datsun. The handwriting is Mrs. Wormser's. We checked. Bravo. Fine work. I suppose you have the letter. This is your handwriting, is it not, Madam? I suppose you have the letter Your Honor? No, but it seems logical to me he had put it in his pants pocket... It's logical. Ah yes, logical but it's too bad. That letter would have proven Mrs. Wormser innocent. How would you know? Very simple, Mrs. Wormser told me what she had written the letter. She is ready to repeat it. Very simply, she was imploring Joseph Marlo to return immediately. A man who pretended to be his friend could not have betray him. Good God, of course she suspected. The Police saw to that. That is why she checked her husband's financial status. Counselor, Mrs. Wormser is capable of telling me all this herself. Yes of course, I understand, but... ... she wrote him, begging he clears himself. She was convinced of his guilt but still wrote him. Please Madam, tell us. That's it exactly, your Honor. Inspector Villon went to Mr. Marlo's residence... ...and found this by the couch.... ...and he found the second earring in a dresser drawer. Are you surprised? How can you be alive? It's a long story! Don't worry, I won't kill you. I should, but I won't. No one would suspect me. ...since I'm already dead, amusing, isn't it? What happened? You're a pretty cool girl aren't you. Come here... Closer. You should see your eyes. It's extraordinary... You're not even afraid. Of course, I'm afraid. Tell me what happened. It's very simple. Your plan went to shit! I knew everything from the very beginning. I woke up not feeling well one night, I needed a breath of air. I saw you and Jeff that night. The following night, I decided to not drink, I listened to you. And the following night, and every other night... I listened , listened, listened... ..until one night, I heard Jeff talk of murdering me. And it became a sort of game. But it was much more than a game for me. What have you done to Jeff? Did you kill him? Did you kill him? Would you like me tell you about the night you killed me? I went up to bed. You thought I was sleeping. But I wasn't. I waited 'till Jeff went home. Then I hit him. You want to know what I hit him with? Wlth the same cudgel you used later And l too carrled hlm to the room by the back door... ...and put hlm ln my bed. After that it was simple. I just had to carry out your plans. I went to Jeff's, tapped the typewriter... ...'till 5 in the morning. I came home, through the backdoor. What if I'd gone upstairs to your room? Well, I would have killed Jeff. And I would have convinced you that you had. We would have been in it together. You probably would have begged me to help you... .. I would have said ''Yes, of course my darling.'' But to return to that marvelous night... Once out to sea, when he came to. l had hlm drlnk whlskey to brlng hlm around completely. You woke him up? Why? For the pleasure of it. I wanted to see his expression. And l had hlm wrlte out a full confesslon... ...statlng that you were hls accompllce. Dld he wrlte lt? Of course. He had no cholce. He elther wrote or dledl He wrote lt then he slgned lt. And what did you do after? I knocked him out. I dragged him to the side of the boat... ..and held his head under water 'till he drowned. I let go of him and the sea carried him away. You didn't think I was capable did you? It's very easy to understand. It was the first time that my wife wanted to kill me. When a man finds his wife plans his death, he is capable of anything. You are sick Louis, you're crazy! No, I'm not sick, I'm very lucid... ...and I'm not finished, my dear. I wrote the letters you received from Jeff. I crashed the car, placed your envelope in his coat pocket... ...your earring in his house... I put the jewels in a safe place. I did all of it, me alone. And what do you have left now? Nothing... You have no lover, no jewels... ... you've got nothing! And that's what I call justice. You think so? It's rather funny, you made love to Jeff here... ..now you're going to do it with me. You see, I'm not afraid I'm not man enough for you. What do you want? What do you want to prove? I don't want to prove anything. From now on, we'll have a new, ''complete'' relationship. Oh yes. A new and complete relationship, that's impossible for you. Even if you wanted to. We'll see. Louis, you're kidding! No, I'm not kidding. You'll do exactly what I want or I'll go to the police. Allright, let's go to the bedroom. No, we'll do it right there. Where you made love with him. Yes, now. You son of a bitch. You're a son of a bitch. Do you want a drink, Louis? No, thank you. I've stopped drinking. - Your sun - Thank you. I found it with the money you left. Does this signify our new relationship? Yes, that's it. 500 francs, that's not bad money to be my husband's whore. Thank you. Don't forget your husband is dead. How long do you think this can last, Louis? Who knows! That's disgust isn't it... ... hatred or what? Accepting hatred. Maybe we'll find happiness later. Hum. Happiness! How could you live with a woman who tried to kill you? How? Oh, there are millions of women who dream of killing their husbands, ...and millions of husbands who dream of killing their wives. The only difference is you tried. No that's not it. I actually wanted to kill you, Louis. Yes, I understand very well, and right now... .... I'm actually trying to forgive you. Do you think I could ever have anything but hate towards you? Even after last night? Last night was different. What...healed you? Watching you and Jeff together. Each time I watched you, I thought I couldn't take it. I would leave... ... but I would come back and start watching again... I did that night after night... ...watching, and eventually... ...one day, my feelings began to change. ...almost like I became him. Then I was a man again. And after that all my anxiety's disappeared... ... my nightmares disappeared. It's funny; thanks to you, I feel alive again... ... and I love life. Are you sure, Louis? Am I wrong? You really have no money whatsoever? Really. I hardly have enough to feed myself. Louis took everything we owned... ...our savings, our stocks. Everything. Yes and you... Oh, no, no, no, nothing. Listen, I'm very sorry, I didn't know. Naturally, I can lend you money in the meantime. In the meantime, what? I don't know how to ever repay you. Don't worry. We'll find a way. No. It's impossible. I've been thinking, didn't Louis have a life insurance policy? Yes of course. 50 million old francs, I believe. Couldn't I get a loan with that as collateral? Possibly, around 1 0 million. No more? How much would you want? I need at least 30 or 40. Want do you want to do with that much money, Julie? But George, I have absolutely nothing! Louis sold the house. I'm going to need to find a place to live. And I want to leave here. I want to forget everything. Well, obviously there is no longer anything here for you. But please understand the process of inheriting could be a long one! Louis' death needs to become official, his will needs to be validated. It could take over a year. With luck, maybe I could get you a small monthly income to get you by.. ...but not the money you're asking for. I'm willing to help you as much as I can Julie, you know that. If you don't know where to go, I can put you up. If you have nothing to eat, you could share my meals. But it's not possible to get you the kind of money you're asking for. You must not leave, Julie. Not bad, huh? Especially with the wind. Too bad you're leaving so soon. You could turn pro. - Say, I've thought about the Wormser case. - Yes? I wonder if that cretin isn't right after all? How's that? Maybe we blew it. Maybe we didn't observe the person who holds the key to the case. Who is that? -Louis Wormser. -Your turn, Fernand. But you're speaking about him as if he's alive!! And why wouldn't he be? We have to think about what Louis Wormser did before the crime. Just doesn't fit. He got out all his money... ... put his house up for sale, didn't say a word to his wife. All this after 1 0 years of marriage. So that the beautiful Julie found herself alone and ruined... ...when he disappeared, and of course, under suspicion. As if she was being punished. She damn well deserved it... ...believe me she's a real slut. Hum, that's just the point. Was this a coincidence or planned? You think Wormser arranged it all before he disappeared? Yes. That's what I'm thinking. He knew his wife was sleeping with Marlo. Or he'd have no reason to punish her. Maybe he knew our two love birds planned to kill him. Yes, but they still had time act, no? No, I don't think so. Do you want dessert? No, thanks, just coffee. Do you have an aged liquor? Cognac or something? We have a local brandy. Perfect! Two provincial brandies and cigars please. This thing with the earring has always bothered me. You don't lose them just like that. Or else you notice it. In my opinion, the earring was planted to get little Julie under suspicion. And Marlo had no motivation. But Wormser certainly did. That's true. Here's what I think. Wormser acted first. At some point he took Marlo's place. He killed him on the boat. After all, it is Marlo's blood, right? Not Wormser's. He's the one who stole his own car... .. and who wrote the letter. What about the car accident? - A little more Brandy? - Gladly. So the car accident? That's easy... Wormser stole Marlo's papers before throwing him overboard... ... he steals his jacket ...and the envelope to the letter that Julie sent to Menton. Now there, Wormser that's a brilliant idea. First of all the letter itself probably contains the proof.. ...to Julie's guilt in her husband's murder attempt. Finally, the envelope's disappearance scared the shit out of the chick. Especially, it seems to prove Marlo was killed running from the cops. There, he got us, the bastard. Marlo wouldn't have left the envelope if he had faked the accident. Wormser is definitely very good; he got what he wanted. He threw his chick into the street, killed her lover... ... split with all the dough. Say, you know it's very clever what you've figured out. Not clever but it stands up. Say, you have any idea where Wormser might be hiding? Oh there, you're asking too much. But if I was you... Wormser's financial counselor. Who? Georges Thorent? Yes, Thorent. He's one of his best friends. And he'll surely need to contact him sooner or later. If I were you, I would watch him. Why are you so strange, Louis? Because I'm getting sick of going in and out like a thief. - But nothing forces you to. - No. - No, it's simple just go to the police. - Well. - I'll tell the police I have amnesia - Yes. They'll never swallow that. - Louis. - Wait. Suppose I go to the police to explain.... I'm kidding of course.... What would you do? I would stay near you. They won't question it. If I live with you, they couldn't say anything. We'd go back to living together? I'd want to try, anyway. You've changed Louis, and I've changed also. I can't believe you. Louis please... ...Please, let's try. Try, but how, even if we lived together 20 years... ... I would always think it was because of the confession. Just burn it and we can forget everything. Very nice!! Congratulations. What are you saying? It's becoming so clear. I'll tell you exactly what I think... You want me to destroy the confession. You'll have your Jeff back... ...get your jewels, the house, everything back. You don't love me. - I'm not crazy. I'm not an idiot. - Louis. - Good evening, Mrs. Wormser. - Good evening gentlemen. Good evening Madam. I'm happy to find you here. No thanks to you. Ah Madam, police work is thankless work. We sometimes have to pry. Don't hold it against the Inspector. Could we have a word? At this hour? Well, gentlemen you're lucky to find me still up. Yes, I know. Please forgive us..... ....but we have some interesting conclusions to present you. Yes and I'd like to ask you a minor question. Have you had any news from your husband? Of course not, I would have called you. I don't doubt it at all. So why this idiotic question? Oh, it's not idiotic, Madam. It's possible that your husband is still alive. Oh please, you have no right to play with people's minds. And you're mocking my husband's death.... We're not playing. This is not a game! We're not fooling around. We're seeking the truth. The truth? Your truth has many faces! I haven't forgotten your report to the police, Inspector. Three days ago you were sure my husband had been killed... ...and that I was an accomplice to the murder. Well, we think the facts can be interpreted another way. You think? I wouldn't have thought you capable of thinking Inspector! Is that a threat? Listen Madam, it's entirely possible your husband is alive. If he was alive, he would have come home. No, maybe not. He could have suffered a blow to the head. And suffering a temporary loss of memory. That's why the Inspector asked you if you had news. No, I don't have news from him. We don't want to take up any more of your time Mrs. Wormser. I'm sure you'll contact us if you see your husband, right? Inspector, if I see him I'll throw myself into his arms. May I go to bed now? You were great and I was stupid. Please forgive me. That was a little close for comfort. Yes, but we'll have to leave. We can't hide here our whole lives. What do you mean? Don't you want to keep paying me to make love to you? Sure, I'll keep paying you. Here's what were going to do... I'll trust you if you'll trust me. I'll forgive you the same way you'll forgive me. O.k.? O.k. They're gone. Do you have a car? - But this is.... - Get in. Does George know about Jeff and me? George knows everything. What's come over you, bringing her here? You're crazy. No, no, not at all! The police came to the house. They thought l was alive. Julie held them off all alone. She was Magnificent. All she wants is to get her confession back. You'll see how fast she'll turn you in after that. That's disgusting! You don't get it . She's trying to get her dough back any way she can. She hit me up this morning. Almost showed her ass to get her bread. Why do you hate me? It's just that I don't like women, dear friend. She tried to kill you to get your dough.... ...and to split with that asshole with the big dick. She would steal your gold fillings if she could. And you trust her? Are you going to keep her with you? Yes, that's right. You're really a child. No I'm not a child. I love her..... ...and I want to stay with her. All you need is to take that fool's confession to the police.. You can have a new life. You deserve it, you've got the mean. No, I would never do that to her. - O.k., so you're an idiot - Georges Excuse me but Julie is my wife. And you'll speak to her with respect. I'm tired, very tired... ..that's enough. This comedy has gone on long enough. It's finished. Leave me alone. You already know I have nothing left. You shut up you stupid female! No, I won't shut up. You can't make me shut up. You have no right. Louis forgave me. We're starting over and you can't make me shut up. Jeff's confession and Louis' money are in a safe at my place. George, please stop. - Good. All this is good to know. - Jeff! Yes... and now all the dead are resuscitated. I'm sure she's cooking up something. In any case the bitch knows more than she's telling us. You're a misogynist, old man! I don't know, but women like her frighten the pants off me. She wouldn't need to frighten my pants off. Do you think she's seen her husband? I'm sure of it! It's funny, but when I propose a theory you jump on it with both feet. In any case, nothing proves Wormser is still alive. You've proved it to me. If she's seen him she knows he killed her lover. Why hasn't she turned him in? She can't. He's got to have proof she and Marlo tried to kill him. Ah. One for you! You're right! Mmm, your sandwich is very good. You have to put butter and ham. God I was stupid. I should have had the villa watched day and night. ...rather than watching the financial advisor. Does your T.V. work? It works but there's a strike and in any case... Even if there wasn't, it's 1 1 :30 so.... Did you know he was alive? Of course he knew. All the time he fucked you, he knew. Listen Julie, you're going to appreciate this. Go on, Louis. Tell your clever little scheme. What do you want? I'll tell you what I want. I want the girl, the dough, and the jewels... ...And I'll get it all. He told you I was dead, huh? Yes...that's what he said. I could never kill anyone. Tell her, tell her what happened! When he came to, we were on the boat. I held my gun on him... ...told him I wanted to kill him. Told him that I knew everything. He begged me to spare him... ... he started crying. Watch out, I'm the one with the gun now. A gun can't change anything now. After that, I forced him to write and sign the confession. I offered him 50,000 new francs... ...and he took it. I would have given him much more. Poor loser, it's all his money. When did you get back? Same time as him. I saw you two making love. You got off on it huh? Yes, she did. You shut up, I'm talking to her now. I thought about you all the time Jeff. Julie! You're coming with me. We're going to get back the dough, the jewels and my confession. You watch him, I'll be back in half hour. Jeff! Let me come with you . Please! Watch him carefully. I won't be long. You lied to me! Be quiet! They're gone. Louis, Louis.... What's the matter? Talk to me, Louis. You know very well it was a just a put on, nothing more. ''Put on'' sometimes kill... We don't think about it, and one day it happens. Hold on, hold on, don't move. Hold on tight, I'll be back soon. Good, stay here. Shit About time. Hello yes. It's me. - Is that him? - Yes, hold on. Tell him Thorent came in with a man who could be Jeff Marlo. Thorent just came in with a man who could be Jeff Marlo. Are you sure? Thorent just went in to his place with a man who could be Jeff Marlo What? - What do we do? - Wait a second. Hello, just one second. Let me think. Tell them to stay put. If someone comes out, follow him discreetly. Be ready to tail if one of them comes out? He says stay put and get ready for ''tailing''. Tell him we're coming. - Hello, I'll be right there. - Very good, Inspector. What a mess! What are you doing here? Louis is dying, quick, quick Julie. What happened? You shot him? He's dying. His heart is giving out. -We've got to save him, Jeff. Hurry, help me! Hurry...... No, no! Don't stop! Why? Everything is fine. Don't stop, he's dying, I've got 200 G's back there. And I burned my confession. Where is George? Don't worry about it. Did you kill him? Never mind. If your husband dies we have what we wanted. Everything worked out for the best, no? But I can't leave him like this. He's suffering. You're going to make me cry. Let's get the fuck out of here, let's disappear. We're free and rich Julie, rich. I don't want to go with you. Oh, So you're only interested in the money. You want to dump me like a piece of shit? You whore. You're mine, you hear me, you're mine. You're mine. I'm going to make you come, you slut. - You're going to scream like you never have. - You're mine. - No Jeff, stop! - Tell me you want some, tell me again. - No, say it again. - No! - Say it again. - No. - Cuff him. - Julie, Julie! We've got to save my husband. We've got to save my husband. We've got to save my husband. Your husband is dead Madam. Your client is waiting in the green office. - Where is it? - Follow me . Thank you, officer. You don't look like you're well. Hello? You don't want to talk to me? Admit that I've done you nothing but good! No, you don't want to. I was told you were traumatized by this whole affair. Understandable.. ... your position could be a lot worse We're going to pin everything on your boyfriend, he asked for it. I'll bet he gets a solid ten to fifteen. As for you my beauty, it's cake.. I'll have you freed on your word.... ..and you'll get a year, a year and a half probation. This is unbearable. What do you want me to say? I don't know, you could say thank you. Thank you. In a way, you got everything you wanted. You're rich, and your husband is dead. Please, be quiet. A lawyer never stops talking, you should know that. I would give everything to have Louis alive. Oh the fickleness of women! I get the feeling you hate me. No, not especially. What is it? It's odd. When I tried killing my husband nothing happened to me.... ...now I'm trying to save him and I'm being punished. That, my beauty, is the puzzle of justice. The truth is whatever people want to believe. And don't forget that it's a man's world. With laws made by men, for men. It's men's justice. You're not even trying to understand me. The law doesn't give a damn about understanding. Come on, the Judge is waiting. Julie!!! Julie!! Julie!!!! Julie!!!!!
