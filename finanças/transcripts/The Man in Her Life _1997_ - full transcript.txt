Where were you? I've been looking everywhere for you. It's time to eat already. You should be used to my job by now. You know that my work requires me to travel to different places. The problem is it takes months before I see you again. But I always come back. And I wouldn't give you my temporary address if I had no intention of coming back to you. Bobby, let's get married. Damn it! You're so demanding! My students won't respect me if I get pregnant without a husband. If teachers are really treated with respect, the government should give you a higher salary. How can I face my aunt and uncle? They took good care of me and sent me to school when I got orphaned. Fine, they're all you think about anyway. And that uncle of yours... I'm sure he'll be thrilled! He might even knock you up himself! Money makes the world go round. So don't think that you're special. Stop it! If you make me angrier, it might take more than a month before you see me again. - Somebody saw you! - That's not true! It's just a rumor! - They're fooling you. Teach her a lesson! - You jerk! Why do you listen to them?! - Beat her up! That'll teach her! - You bastard! Selya! - Get up! - Stop it! It's not true! Enough! Selya! I thought you're at school. Why are you still here? It's noon already. I'll go ahead. You bastard! You cheated on me! I'm giving you a week to read Florante and Laura. Tell me why Balagtas' masterpiece is not just an ordinary love story. You're in trouble! That's enough! She's mad already! Don't wait for me anymore. Just eat with Selya. Tina and I are going to catch the last full show. Come on, let's eat. I'm not hungry. Don't waste your tears on Bobby. He's not a good man. I heard that he's often chased by the women he sleeps with. Do you want to end up like them? Your aunt went out to watch a movie! Come on, we won't tell anyone. It'll be our little secret. Go ahead! If you come near me, I'll scream! I just got carried away. It won't happen again. Selya... Your Aunt Diding will look for you if you leave. Have mercy on me. I'll surely be in trouble. Please don't leave. Selya... Selya... Hey, wait! Hey! Narcy! I've been looking for you! Belen has the latest gossip! Let's go and hear it! Fine, if you don't want to, suit yourself! - Hey, you're cheating! - There. You wimp! Ice candy! - Let's talk about your kid first. - No way. Don't drag my kid into this. You know, I saw them again last night. Once the public discovers these malicious stories, that school will be closed down. Oh please! They're just rumors, Belen! You don't have any proof! My husband saw everything. Tell them! The guy usually leaves around the time roosters start to crow! And that wasn't just once! I see them almost every night! - Belen... - Excuse me. Do you know this address? - The sun's out yet she still wears bright colors! - How pathetic... Go straight then turn left on the third corner. Then go straight and turn right on the fourth corner. It's beside the biggest house on the block. What do you need from Piling? Thank you very much. She might tell Ramon about what she heard! Your son will be kicked out of that school! What's so funny? Piling, I heard four of our boarders moved to another dormitory. What happened? I asked them to leave because they weren't complying with our house rules. They're drinking and gambling in the house. They also steal from each other and often get into fights. - They're disturbing the other boarders. - Maybe you're too strict on them. Is this the house of... Miss! Oh dear, what's happening to her?! Let me handle this. - Leave that to me. - I got it! Those medical representatives are often chased by women. They run away from their responsibilities. You know Bobby? Where is he? When's he coming back? Did he mention anything about me coming here? Let go of me! - Do you know a place where I can stay? - This is a boarding house. - Can I rent a room here? - We don't accept female boarders! Piling, prepare a room for Miss... Selya. Selya De Castro. By the way, I'm Ramon Torres. I own this boarding house and the one across the street. He's Carding. Ricardo Santos. Let me help you with that. Take care of her. You and your crazy ideas! You're being silly! Everyone's talking about it. There's no point in hiding the truth. It's possible that you don't know anything but don't tell me you're not having doubts. Get away from me! You nosy woman! Scram! I'm going out. - I'll ask around town. - Don't come home late. I don't want to wait up just to open the door for you. Okay. Check. Checkmate. I bought those in Manila. You shouldn't have bothered. Anything for your wife and kids. Bread rolls! Freshly baked! Very hot! - This isn't enough... - Bread rolls! Ramon has a name and reputation to protect. You have to end your obscene affair. Take the initiative! Bread rolls! Very hot! Perfect for those who are feeling hot and just can't get enough of hot stuff! Here. She has books in her luggage. She's either educated or just a bookworm. Just the type your parents would approve of. I spoke to somebody from System Laboratories. He doesn't know when Bobby will be back. It could be next month or next year. I can't stay here that long. I'll end up spending all my savings. I can't go back home because... I already lost my job. I resigned from being a teacher. You're a teacher? Wait! How long and where have you been teaching? - You teach elementary or high school? - Why do you ask? - Get dressed! - Wait a second! No more questions! I know what I'm doing. You have to trust me. I'll take care of you. It's a good thing I pray relentlessly. God hears all my prayers. Here's a decent outfit. Come, these will suit you. No school will hire a teacher in the middle of the school year. Besides, I didn't bring my transcript of records with me. If you stay here longer, you'll be able to see Bobby. Here's Mrs. Lazaro's replacement. She's worried because she didn't bring her transcript of records. I said she can submit it some other time. She can start as a substitute. She has her other documents with her anyway. - Okay, I'll take it from here. - Sure. Piling seems to adore you. She grew up in our home. My parents sent her to school. Now that I'm orphaned, she assumed the role of my mother. Mrs. Lazaro's substitute had to go home to Cagayan to attend a relative's funeral. I had to take over her classes. It's really hard to teach and run a school at the same time, so I'm glad you're here. Don't be too happy about it just yet. I'm not even sure if I can pull it off. I've never handled high school students before. Good morning, Mr. Torres. Good morning, class. We have a new teacher. Please welcome Ms. De Castro, Selya De Castro. Good morning, Ms. De Castro. Good morning. I don't have a lesson plan since I didn't know I'll be teaching today. But I don't want to waste our time, so I'd like to get to know each of you. Please say your names and... You're going overboard. It's humiliating! It's important to me that you find a wife. I'm sure it's what your parents would've wanted. This is the least I could do to repay the debts I owe your parents. Your family used their wealth to build this school in order to help the people here. All of this will go to waste if you do not have an heir. Selya is brokenhearted. Wounded hearts are in search for love. You know what I am! Rumors about what you are have started to spread but Selya has no idea about that! In case she asks, I'll cover for you. It's up to you if you want to throw all of this away. What kind of a student are you? You're our only hope but you keep screwing up! Damn you! How will you graduate! My son was just caught smoking! What's the big deal about that?! There are bigger scandals here than this! You can't discipline your students, so you bother the parents!? You think we just sit around and do nothing?! We have businesses to take care of! If the students can't be stopped from buying this stuff, then it's best that they buy from me. At least they can be assured of the quality of my candies, right? Same reason why I sell pencils and pens in my class. For quality and not for the money. What will I do with coins anyway? They cannot suspend you! We will fight back. We will get even! Especially to that gay principal of yours! - He's just jealous of your son's earrings! - He better watch out! I'll gather evidence! I know how to use a camera. I'll send pictures to the Department of Education! Let's see if he doesn't end up doing embroidery! Don't bother, I'll do it. You already brought food. You shouldn't do the cleaning. Finish your food. Where did Carding go? He went to another town. For work, he said. I don't know what's up with him. He didn't mention anything about you two arguing about something. I'll go ahead. Give your Uncle Ramon a kiss, he's leaving already. That's mine! That's enough. Go play over there. I said I don't want to! - I'll tell Papa about this! - Be quiet! Thanks for everything. You're welcome. Why have you stopped visiting me? Are you hiding from me? There's no reason for me to do that. Don't play games with me. Your wife told me you're looking for a job in another town! You shouldn't be doing heavy work. Your lung problem might come back. You never did that to me before. Are you leaving me? What's the matter with you? Is Piling asking you to stay away from me? I can make my own decisions. No one can tell me what to do. I want you to have a wife and children. I want someone to take care of you when you grow old. - Don't worry about me. - Who will take care of you when you get older? Piling? She'd be long dead by the time you age! You'll be alone and weak. Why can't you admit that you're affected by what people are saying? Carding? Carding! We'll go ahead, thanks. - Take care. - Let's go, Chito! - Just hand the collection to him. - You do it. My goodness! Selya! Ramon, what happened to you?! Selya, quick! Help me here! Let's bring him inside. Come on, Selya. What happened to you, Ramon? I think you're better at this than me. You take over. I'll handle your students. - Piling! - Don't worry, I won't take long. I'll buy medicine for him. You can handle that. Just take care of him. Please tell him that I dropped by. But it will take some time before I visit him again. I've been hired at a ship harbor in Manila. Take care of him. Hot bread rolls! Come on! Let's steal some bread. Hey! You damn kids! Don't touch those! Hey! Hey! Carding dropped by. He said he won't be visiting for a long time. He's going to work in Manila. Soft you, a word or two before you go. I have done the state some service and they know it. No more of that. I pray you, in your letters, when you shall these unlucky deeds relate. Speak of me as I am. Nothing extenuate, nor set down aught in malice. Then must you speak of one that loved not wisely, but too well. Of one not easily jealous, but being wrought, perplexed in the extreme... I've read that. Me too. Who took care of the plants? I did. Carding used to do that. Is he working for you? Tell me about yourself. I live a lonely life. I live a lonely life as well. - Piling! Please tell Selya to take care of me too! - Shut up! This town's hopeless! It's like a breeding ground for gossip! Now they're making stories about you two. Imo is spreading rumors about you sleeping here. I'm not bothered by gossip. Let's get married. How can you marry a woman you barely know? I'm not joking. You're just getting ahead of yourself. I've been here for less than two months, you don't know me well. You've already told me a lot about yourself. You even told me about your uncle and Bobby. What else do I know about you except for the fact that you like to be alone and that you've been so quiet lately? He's single and he's a good man. Plus, you both love to read. Piling, please leave us for a moment. Excuse me. Let her go. Give her time to think. She needs to know something about me. - I'll take care of that. - No, I should be the one to tell her. I have to go. Hey! Who gave you permission to drink in here? Mind you, this house is not yours! That's enough! - We'll just finish this. - Just one more bottle. You jerks! You still love him? I've been here for a while already, and after talking to a number of his colleagues, I'm sure he knows that I'm looking for him. But still I haven't heard a word from him. How about Ramon? What's your ideal man? Someone like them? Or that Bobby? Santa Monica is a really nice town. No wonder your parents weren't tempted to buy a house in Manila. And here you are. Continuing the good work they've started. Selya, You know what? Piling's right. What do I want out of my life? What do I look for in a man? Certainly not like them, not those men who came and left me. Let's get married. - I'm different, Selya. - I know. And that's what makes me want you. But... What if she discovers my relationship with Carding? What if she finds me disgusting? That's impossible! I already told her. She doesn't mind. She's not like other women. If I were you, I'd go for it. Sweetheart! Long time no see! I've been waiting for you. Your timing's perfect. Give him a beer. I have a new guy. He's a star! I'll introduce him to you. Just wait here, I'll look for him. Here he is. I'm sure you'll enjoy this. Show him what you got! Sir! Please don't tell my parents! They'll kill me for sure! Who will wear the gown on your wedding? You or Mr. Torres? You have the time to spread gossip but you can't even discipline your own son? He's been skipping school for weeks! That should keep her mouth shut. Some nerve you have to criticize others when your own home is falling apart! I don't believe you! Don't make us out to be as filthy as you! In the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, Amen. Give honor to Christ by submitting to each other. Wives, submit to your husbands as to the Lord. Sister sent this for Ms. De Castro. Okay, thanks. Dude, that's a lot of gifts. - Don't bother polishing your shoes. You're not invited! - Maybe he has a date with Piling. Who got married? Selya, the teacher. She's getting married right now. Hey, you can't go in there! Cheers to the newlyweds! Cheers to the newlyweds! Give her a kiss! Look at them, they're so sweet. Let's go! Look at Mr. Torres... He got himself a gorgeous wife! Maybe he just wants to borrow her lipstick. I'm sure they'll just end up having a pillow fight tonight. Stop it! What's wrong? Maybe you're just tired. Let's go to sleep. You've been here a long time already yet you still don't follow our regulations. You made noise with your motorcycle all night and you even woke me up just to open the gate for you! I stayed outside hoping to get invited to the wedding reception! I waited for a long time but no one even bothered to invite me! - Mr. Caringal... - She came here for me! She found this place because of me. And I'm getting her back from that gay man. Then go find another place where you can stay! You've only been married for a week, what's with the sour face? It's none of your business. I'm staying at Burgos' boarding house in Lapitan street. Piling kicked me out of her shabby house. Selya doesn't care about what kind of hell you're living in! Scram! Why didn't you tell me you kicked him out already? Is there something else that you're not telling me? Selya, you already have a husband. A husband who never touches me?! Whenever we're in bed together, I can feel he's disgusted with me... like I have some sort of disease. Damn it. - What's bothering you? - Nothing. You don't have to leave. If money is your problem, I can provide for your family. Don't worry about us. You've done a lot for us already. I'll have a hard time without you. I don't think I can handle it. I'm doing this to stop others from mocking and judging you. I won't stand here and watch them insult you. Think about your name and reputation. But I already forced myself into marriage. What else do you want me to do? - Carding, I can't take it anymore. - Stop it! Just one more kiss, Carding. - Please! One last hug... - No! You sick bastards! You betrayed me! You animals! You freaks! You shameless bastards! I just came here to say goodbye. I love Ramon! And I couldn't bear to leave without seeing him for one last time! What does a man like you know about love?! All you want is his money! Security! I thought you already knew? I guess the whole town does! And I'm so stupid for not knowing about it sooner! You're disgusting! Carding is gone. He's gone for good. It's just you and me now. Let's see this through. I want a baby. And where do we get a child? From a fruit's seed?! You used me to save your reputation. Well, you're going to regret it. St. Jude, I call thee. Hear thou my earnest plea in sorrow's night, ever thy faithful one when all lives whose are done lead me... You told me she knew! You said she didn't say anything! And that she understood! Pray for the pains and fears, burden my soul to tears... Why did you lie to me? I thought that if you would sleep together, it will solve everything. And you will be cured. Piling, I'm not sick! This is not a disease! Come, let's pray for it to go away. St. Jude, I call thee. Hear thou my earnest plea. In sorrow's night, ever thy faithful one. When all lives whose are gone lead me to life, lead me to life... I'm going crazy just wondering how I'd reconcile with you. I didn't see this one coming. Wait. We're not yet done. Don't worry, this won't be the last time you'll see me. What about the gay guy? You know? Of course! You didn't? Just leave through the back door so no one will see you. I want them to talk about us. Where have you been? Time to eat. I'm already full. But I won't tell you what I ate. You might get jealous. Life is good when you have two husbands! I bet you're all envious! Just look at that! Have mercy on Ramon. People are laughing at him. I'm in this mess because of you. So please leave me alone. What about your students? How can they respect you? If teaching is a respectable job, the government should be paying us more. Do you know who told me that? My lover boy. I'm not going to teach anymore. But I still demand to be paid. My husband's the principal anyway! The honorable professor Ramona Torr... That's not Bobby's child. It's mine. The child will carry my name. I'll love him dearly and I will bequeath the school and all my properties and assets to him. Don't play the martyr. My child's true father will take responsibility for him. Take me away from here. I don't want to show my face to Ramon anymore. You don't have to marry me. Just take responsibility for our child. Fine. Let's run away tonight. Wait for me in front of your house. Hot bread rolls! Someone saw him leave last night. Liar! You're lying again. I'm here. I will never leave you. I just have one favor to ask. I hope we can be friends, for the sake of that child... Our child. Bread rolls! Why did you flunk my son? Can't we discuss this first? Let's discuss this in my office. But I'm not promising anything. Don't think I'm incapable of causing trouble. And what's more, I have my cohorts here. What kind of trouble do you have in mind? That baby... are you sure it's... Your baby looks exactly like his father. He's got the shape of his face, nose, mouth, and chin. Everything! You know who the baby's real father is. It's Ramon. - Here you go. - Thank you. Such a cute baby! My grandson! - Don't touch him. - I washed my hands. Such a cute baby. So handsome. He looks just like you. Oh, he's quite strong! I have such a cute grandson. - Piling, watch your hands! - Come on, I washed them! What's the name of the child? Ramon Torres, Jr. Ramon Torres, Jr., I am baptizing you in the name of the Father... and of the Son... and of the Holy Spirit. Amen. Okay. Hush now, Ramoncito. Why? Give him to me. I think he has started teething. I can make him stop crying. No. Babies want to be in their mothers' arms when they're sick. Right, Ramoncito? What did Papa do to you? There, there. Hush now. So you smoke now. Since when? When did you become rich? You fooled a rich old hag? I worked overseas. I left System Labs. I run my own business now. That's not enough to pay for all the trouble you've caused! Don't tell me you're satisfied with Ramon? So what if I am? That's impossible! Bobby, please! You abandoned me. You can't just come back and play games with me again. Ramon is a good man. Then stay with him but let's keep this thing between us going. Stop thinking you can try to change me because I won't. This is what I want out of life. Mommy! Let's play! Mommy, who is he? Papi! Hey! Come here! - How's my baby? Did you enjoy? - I did but the rocks were a bit sharp. - Really? - Yes! How do you do? You left these earlier. I just came here to bring your stuff and... and... Papi, who is he? Mommy's friend. Let's go inside. Piling, please prepare a snack for our guest. If you want to say something, make it quick! I still have things to do! Don't let your anger get the best of you. You just told me earlier that there's no way you'd change. That was before I saw my son. He's handsome. He looks just like me. So the big bad wolf huffed and puffed and he blew the house of sticks down. Then the two little pigs ran out as fast as they could to their brother who lived in the house made of bricks. Papa, what's wrong? Nothing. It's a nice story. I want to read you more stories... I want to tell you stories not just today... but until you grow up. The wolf knocked on the house of bricks. "Little pigs, little pigs, will you let me in? Not by the hair of your chinny chin chin. Then I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house down." So the big bad wolf huffed and puffed and he blew on the house made of bricks. But hard as he would, he couldn't blow it down. Still he huffed and he puffed, and he blew so hard... he burst to tiny pieces. That was the end of the big bad wolf. And the three little pigs lived happily ever after. Bobby! - Come here! - Where are you taking me, Bobby?! I don't think I can show my face to Ramon ever again. I'm here now. I'll take you and our son with me. We'll talk to a lawyer. I will not fail you again. I'll make it up to you. I'll push Ramon to the edge. He doesn't know who he's dealing with. I won't allow it. Ramoncito is my son. I know that I'm not worthy to stay in this house. But I can't leave without my son! That man just left without a warning. He didn't even bother to check on you when you gave birth. How can I entrust my son to someone like him? You're not his father. Coffee? I don't need to justify what I did during the time I was away! I'm here because my lawyer said I have a right as the child's father! What cheap law school did your lawyer attend? Why doesn't he know that I am the legal parent of the child? Ramoncito was born during the time I was married to his mother - ...and living under one roof. - You may live under one roof but you never made love! I can prove that! Cream or sugar? Bobby, that's enough! Anyone in this town can testify in court. Everyone knows you're the boy's father. How could you know? Do you have any proof other than gossip? Ramon had an ex-lover. His name is Carding. He used to sleep in their house every night and leave in the morning. Sir, you can get us as witnesses! We won't ask for money. If ever, just for a small price! Sir, please. We'll be your witnesses. Sir! - Sir, we'll be your witnesses! - You don't have to pay us, sir! - Sir, please! We'll be your witnesses! - Sir, when are you coming back? Sir, please! Sir! - Sir! - That's enough! Are you out of your mind?! - This is easy money! - They flunked you before. This is my chance to get back at them! Fine, I will testify against Mr. Torres! I know he's gay because I saw him at a gay bar before his wedding. You work as a waiter in a gay bar? I'm not a waiter, I'm the star! - I'm an escort! - You bastard! Imo, please! Now I know why you flunked in school! You've been up to no good! - We're both in the selling trade! - And what are you selling?! - Imo, enough! - Your ass?! - You bastard! - He's your son! Abet, run! If you testify against Ramon in court to disprove his paternity, that will all be yours. I can never betray a friend. Don't make me laugh. Everyone in Santa Monica knows about your relationship with Ramon. You're asking me to betray the person who taught me how to read and write? The person who trained me to eat using utensils... and gave me my first pair of shoes? You want to buy my dignity? A true man of character faces his responsibilities and never runs away from it. He doesn't hurt others even when he's hurt. That's the kind of man Ramon is. And so am I. He can't satisfy my needs. And that's all that matters to you? I'm sick. My lungs are failing me but my principles are intact. It's not true that I'm only after financial security. Now I know you're really gay! You talk too much! Let's go! Give him to me! You'll have to kill me first before you can take him! You really want to get shot? The kid or me?! You don't mind leaving our son behind? I can give you more children! Selya, wait! What if Ramoncito asks about you? What if he gets sick? He should be with his mother. Wait for him here. See how easy it was to scare that gay man? I just had to drag you by force. I win! Papa! - Shut up! - Papa! - Selya, let's go! - Papa! Damn it! Enough! Let's go! Before I lose my temper and kill someone! You can't do it. You've ran away many times. You're a coward! Don't be stupid! Never again! It's over! - I understand now what a real man is. - Will he ever satisfy your sexual urges? With you Bobby, it's only about lust. I don't want to grow old with you. Papa! Thanks. No, I should thank you for being a father to Ramoncito. What about you? The body ages... and soon its sexual urges will die. But what we have is mutual respect. And friendship. I wanted to go to you when his condition got worse. But he didn't want to disturb you. - Where are the kids? - They're staying with my parents so they won't contract his disease. Excuse me. How did you find out? Thank you. You've done more for me. How shameless some people are. They even go to church. My wife has accepted me for who I am. We don't keep secrets from each other anymore. And we will tell our son the truth when he grows older. More importantly, we will raise him to become a man who respects himself and respects others. Did you hear that, Belen? You bastard! You're just as filthy! You take after your damn father! Why are you blaming me? This bastard turned out like this because of your big mouth! You do nothing but gossip! How dare you say that! Out of my way! Some nerve you got! I don't need you! Your son turned out the way he is because of you! All you do is gossip! Damn you! Leave! - I'm really leaving you! - How dare you! Celso! Let's continue painting, Ramoncito. Not that part... - Piling! - Come! Hurry! - Take a look! - Come on, kids! See? I told you. Come on, kids. Time for snacks.
