Look around you. Every time we meet, there are less and less of us. The time has come to do something about it. I say it's time to fight. - No, no, the fight is over, people. We're outnumbered, we're outgunned. All that's left is escape. - Harris, you're gonna stay and fight, aren't you? - [Leader] Maria, how can you say that? You, of all people, you should-- - I know, Zak. I of all people should understand and, believe me, I do. - [Zak] Everybody has lost someone. Some, their whole families. - [Maria] I lost my husband to the fight and my brothers. - [Zak] That's the price of freedom. - [Maria] It's too high a price to pay when nothing has changed. - Your family didn't die in vain, Maria. Stay and-- - My son and I are going to the Dakotas. - And how long will there be sanctuary in Dakota before it falls like New Idaho? - [Maria] You said yourself, many have gone before us. - In three weeks, we will launch our offensive. I say, it is better to die fighting than running. (cheers) - No, Zak! (cheers) (gun bangs) (screaming) - [Man] Get her! (booming) (gun rattles) (booming) (gun rattles) (screaming) (guns banging) - Hurry, hurry! (guns banging) - [Man] Run up there above the roof! (shouting) (guns banging) - [Man] Let's go, come on! Come on, let's go! - [Woman] Come on, we're gonna make it! (booming) (shouting) (guns banging) - [Man] They're getting away! (shouting) (guns banging) - [Man] Go, go! (guns banging) - Take that home. - [Man] Holy shit! (booming) (shrieking) (guns banging) (screaming) (guns banging) (shouting) - [Man] Up here! Get him before he gets away! (guns banging) (groaning) - My father! (guns banging) (guns banging) - They're killing everyone. - There's nothing we can do to help them now. - Dad wouldn't run away. - It's too late. (guns rattling) (booming) (crying) (engine revs) (screaming) (sobbing) - [Woman] No! - [Man] Bring her to me. - [Woman] Let me go! No, don't! - Send the battle wagon. - [Man] You're mine now, you little witch. - [Woman] No! - [Man] I don't care you're crying! - [Man] Back off, she's mine! - [Woman] You're hurting me! - Bring them here. - [Man] Shit. Bitch. - Leave her, Arco. She isn't for you. Those are the rules. - Says who? (wind roars) - Who dares defy the word of the Grand Shepherd? You? You defy the word of the Grand Shepherd? Arco, you and I shall meet again. Baalca, how long must you make one wait? - We have crushed the last group of traitors, Lucas. - Ah, that's very good. Now we know that we have the unity of the New Idaho. And this bearded one, is he their leader? - Yes. I will take him back for interrogation. There is no sign of the arms merchants. - We'll catch them sooner or later. Don't concern yourself. - I will not rest until they are dead. - [Lucas] Arco, you and I will meet another time. - Our men await your blessing. - They shall have it. (chuckles) As you wish. And this day shall be blessed for it will be remembered as a day that our enemies were crushed. (shouting) (jagged rock music) - You've shamed me before the shepherds, Arco. I will not be made a fool of. (fleshy smack) - [Man] Oh, feed him to the dogs. - Take him away. - [Man] Yeah, come on, you move out with me. - [Man] You'll be fed to the dogs. Come on, move him over to the right. Get him down there where he belongs. Get those sluts in there. Come on, get the prisoner down to the shepherds. Get the battle wagon moved. - Daddy! - Claudia! (groaning and grunting) - [Man] Never mind. - [Man] Back up, wanderer, or you're dead. - [Man] Come on, get up. - [Man] Don't worry about your daughter, she's in good hands with us now. - [Man] Yeah! (melancholic instrumental music) (rumbling) (mystical instrumental music) - [Man] Ah, get him off me! Get him off me! - The word has been passed, and it will not be forgotten. - Long ago, the Grand Shepherd wrote that the warrior and the priest shall stand together and prosper. - Forgive me! - It was the guidance of the shepherds that saved the warrior from the disease that befell all sinners. - Blessed is the word of the Grand Shepherd. - [Arco] I'm no sinner! Don't leave me with her! Lord Shepherd, forgive me! - [Baalca] Be still, Arco. Don't you like my pet? - [Arco] Cut me down. (dog whines) - Perhaps I will. But, first, tell me what you have learned, Arco. (dog barks and growls) I will ask you once more. - Thou shalt not go against the will of the Grand Shepherd. - Very good. See? That wasn't very hard, was it? I'll let you down now. - No, no! No! (barking) No! No! (screams) (growling) (moaning) (grunting) (screaming) (rumbling) (grunting) - [Man] No! (grunting) - Where are the traitors? Where are the stolen weapons? - You'll see both soon enough. - We'll break him. Look, why don't you tell me all you know? I have no wish to see you suffer. - I know nothing. - Then maybe your daughter will be more helpful. - The monks won't let you touch her in here. She's too valuable. (gentle instrumental music) - [Man] Perhaps you desire that one yourself? - No. No, her role will be much greater. It is as the prophets have written, a maiden young with eyes so blue, heart so pure and innocent. - What are you doing? Why don't you speak? - They can't reply. They cannot speak. - Why? - It's the rules. Otherwise, they would not be allowed in the sanctum. You see, anyone who enters in the sanctum must remain silent. - Why isn't this dress like the others? - Because you are different. (gentle instrumental music) (chugging rock music) - [Man] 44-6, over. Report activity in Sector Four. In pursuit of wanderers heading for the border. Over. - [Man] How many renegades? Do you need backup, over? - [Man] Affirmative, numbers unknown. Send reinforcements, over. (dramatic rock music) - Well, lookey what we got here. (engine grumbles) Where ya coming from, Mama? - [Maria] Let me go. - We can't do that, lady. We got a job to do. We're the Border Patrol. Ain't that right, boys? - She sure smells sweet, Ozzie. We gonna kill her? - Not yet. (tense instrumental music) (grunting) (guns click) (tense instrumental music) You're not gonna kill me, are you? 'cause, uh, I'm scared, I'm real scared. Come on, shoot me. (tense instrumental music) Come on. Go ahead, shoot me. (grunting) (dramatic instrumental music) You gonna die. - I'm not afraid to die. - [Ozzie] I'm certainly glad you said that. - Don't shoot him. - Too fucking late, lady. (gun clicks) (tense instrumental music) Never take your hands off your fucking weapon! - [Man] I found another one. (booming) - I told you not to do that. (guns bang) (moaning) (guns bang) A fucking broad! (guns bang) You fucking bitch! (guns bang) - I can't believe it, man. It's another fucking broad. - We better get our shit together, Little Jack. (gun bangs) - What are we gonna do, Ozzie? - You can start by stop fucking whining, boy! - I ain't got no more fucking ammo. I'm outta here. (lively rock music) (gun bangs) - You better start praying, bitch, 'cause I'm gonna blow your fucking ass right out of New Idaho! (guns bang) (lively rock music) (gun bangs) (booming) (groaning) (lively rock music) - Where are you, bitch? (gun rattles) (groaning) (droning ambient music) (gun clicks) - You're dead, bitch. (gun bangs) (droning ambient music) (birds tweet) - It's time for you to make your own decisions. - [Harris] No, we'll make them together. - No. Just do it. - Don't talk like that. - No, no, Harris. - You're not gonna die. - Harris, look, listen to me. Here, take this. It was your father's. Wear it with dignity. - I will. (melancholic instrumental music) No. No. No. No! No! (rock music) - The reinforcements will be coming. I'll take you to the Dakotas. - I'm going back. - There's no one left. You said yourself, the raiders killed everyone. - Someone had to survive. I have to go back, to fight. What do you care? - It's not what your mother would've wanted. - When my mother left, I had to choose between two people. I didn't want my mother to die, so I left. Now she's dead. - [Woman] And there's someone else back there? - Claudia. The girl I left behind. - What if she's dead, too? - She's not dead. She can't be dead. Who the hell do you think you are anyway? - I was only trying to help. - Look, I'm going back, with or without you. - [Woman] I was heading back there anyway. I just didn't want to get us both killed, hotshot. - My name's Harris. - [Woman] Danielle. (meditative instrumental music) - Your obsession with these two arms merchants is annoying me. Find them quickly and have done with it. - Then let me have the girl. I need her to make the wanderer talk. - But then what if he does not talk? It's been a waste of time, and I have offended the Grand Shepherd. You see, Baalca, his, his plan is not to be trifled with. - I'm not trifling, Lucas. These two men are very dangerous. They've already destroyed the 6th Sector, and they want to destroy us. - Is not one a simple paramedic and, uh, the other a foot soldier from the old army? - We must kill them, and they will never return to fight again. It is as written in the New Bible. - Do not quote the New Bible to me. I live the New Bible. - Let me have the girl, and the arms merchants are yours. (gentle instrumental music) - Claudia. Baby. Thank God, you're safe. They haven't harmed you? - They want me for the one they call the Grand Shepherd. - [Zak] Baalca? - Ballca took me away from them. - Then she has done as she said she would. - Father, what about you? - [Zak] It's not important. You're safe, that's all that counts. - Father! (mysterious instrumental music) (throbbing instrumental music) - [Woman] There, help! (throbbing instrumental music) - The new bride, bring her to me. (mysterious instrumental music) (chuckling) I can see why they chose you for the grand one. - Please, don't. - Don't be afraid. You'll find my touch to be far more gentle than the other shepherds. (plucky instrumental music) We are launching our offensive on the arms merchants. I'll radio the positions to the battle patrols. You must tell them, wait for my order to attack, understood? - Yes, Commander. There will be no mistakes. - There better not be. It is time. - My daughter? - She is safe. The arms merchants, where will I find them? - Where the river meets the mountains. In the area you call Fisherman's Cove. That's where you can find them. - Do you speak the truth? - It is the truth. - You have shown great courage, wanderer. You shall suffer no more. (gun bangs) Have the troops move out! - [Man] Order, hua! (shouting) (engines rumbling) (lively rock music) - [Man] HQ to all stations, maintain scrambled radio frequencies. Battle patrols Alpha and Charlie will rendezvous at Fisherman's Cove. Battle cruisers will detail troop supports, over. (lively rock music) - [Man] Command 12 to HQ, request details of enemy strengths and weapons, over. - [Man] The camp of the arms merchants is controlled by two army vets, Sergeant Chuck McKenzie and Lieutenant William "Iodine" Smite. And certain guerrillas from over the border may be under their command. This is the last holdout of the renegade traitors. It may be heavily defended. All resistance in the sector must be destroyed. Over. (lively rock music) - [Man] Wanderers up ahead. - [Man] Rear guard, look after them, over. (lively rock music) - Raiders! - Shit! Get him outta here! - No, no! - [Man] Come on, shoot him, come on! (guns rattle) (lively rock music) - [Man] Oh, I'm gonna make him mine. (guns bang) (groaning) (guns bang) (lively rock music) - [Man] What's that up ahead? - Looks like the Border Patrol. - Rear guard, report status, over. - [Man] Traitors destroyed. Over. - [Man] It's Ozzie. (pounding rock music) - We were ambushed. The jeep's destroyed. And they're all dead. - Ambushed by who? - We were chasing this woman and her kid, and another bitch attacked us. - You lost to two women and a boy? - [Man] God! - [Jack] She fought like the devil. - You're a fool. (engine rumbles) - Leave him. - [Man] Go away, let the cannibals get him. (engines rumbles) - [Man] Border Patrol on highway, do not assist. Repeat, do not assist. (thudding) (grunting) (laughing) (driving rock music) - Oh shit. - This place has gone to hell in a hand basket. (driving rock music) Look at all this junk. Everyday, you bring more. - It's not junk, Chuck. I can get plenty in trade for that on the black market. - Bull. - No, seriously, there's a big market growing out there. - Who you gonna trade it to, the raiders? - Now that's not a bad idea. - If it's not junk, then why do you always wind up with more of it than you started with? - I don't know, maybe I'm just a good businessman. - Businessman my ass. Look at that. What the hell are you gonna use golf clubs for? - [Computer] If golf's not your sport, I know some games we can play. - Tell your dating service to put a zipper on it. - Dolores, do you have to make fun out of everything? (computer bloops) - Don't call it Dolores. It's just a damn machine, Jesus! - [Dolores] Just a machine? After all the times I've saved your hide? If it weren't for me, you guys never would have made it out of Vietnam. - That's it, I have had it. - Chuck, take it easy, take it, I'll take care of it. Dolores, please. - [Dolores] Well, for you, honey, okay. - That close. (humming) (whistles) (rumbles) Where's she going? - Oh, she's going to feed the prisoner. - Why? - [Woman] Hi, Mr. Rocket Man. - [Rocket Man] What do you want? - Oh my, what a big rocket you have. - Leave me and my rocket alone. - What are you so afraid of? Don't worry, you're safe with us. - We're just here to feed you. - I, I'm not hungry. - We are. - We are. - Out. - We can come back later, if you like. (chain clinks) - What's with you, Chuck? - Oh, I'm sorry, man. I guess my strength's just been a little short lately. - Probably male menopause or something. - Don't push it. - All right, look, I got something to show you. You're gonna love this. Beautiful, ain't it? Enough for a small army. - [Chuck] Yeah, but what'd you hide it behind the damned head for? - Well you said you wanted it out of the camp. - Yeah, but I, forget it. - [Merchant] Do you think the offensive is going to work? - Well, I'll tell you what, if it doesn't, we're gonna be in deep shit. - I don't know, Chuck. - We promised the wanderers we'd be there. You gonna weasel out on me? They need us. - Look, I'm not weaseling out. I just don't feel like dying, that's all. You want me to be straight with you, I'll be straight. You don't have a fucking plan, do ya? We're just gonna go in that fortress and get our asses blown off. - Maybe I do and maybe I don't, but I need to know, are you gonna fish or cut bait? - Yeah, I'm with you. - That's all I need to know.

(rustling) (tense instrumental music) - [Harris] Danielle. - [Cannibal] Oh, that tastes good. (tense instrumental music) (cannibals grumbling) (tense instrumental music) - [Cannibal] Hey, where'd they go? (banging) (tense instrumental music) - Go, they're right behind us.

(booming) Go! (exciting instrumental music) - We're going to get you! (exciting instrumental music) - [Danielle] Look out, Harris, he's on your right. Look out! Hey, do something, Harris! Come on, do something, come on! - [Harris] Do it. (gun bangs) (engine rumbles) (exciting instrumental music) - Yeah, I got him. (guns bang) (thunderous boom) - Woo! - All right, Harris! - Yeah! (fire crackles) - It is as written by the prophets in the New Bible, you shall carry his seed, his blood will be yours, yours will be his, because, as written so shall it be, shall it be. (wheezing) He's been ravaged by the years but his life is not done. You see, he leaves a legacy, his and your child. (wheezing) - [Claudia] Oh no, no! - Shh. Let me tell you, girl, it is so much easier to give birth one time in your life than once every year as all the rest of the new mother's do. You will give birth but once. You can trust me. Go ahead. (gurgling) (whimpering and moaning) - [Man] Be still! Your child will live forever. (whimpering and groaning) (screaming) (baby crying) (chains rattling) - Your plan is coming to fruition. Soon she will bear your seed as the others have done. Then the family will be complete. Father, your time may pass, but your dream will endure forever. I will let nothing stand in its way. Father. Oh, yes. You feel it, don't you, Father. Yes, father, I was weak. I tried to love her, Father. She wanted to destroy your dream for New Idaho. And I was weak, Father. With the innocent, pure seed I bring to you now, we'll wipe away the evil of Baalca, won't we, Father? And your dream of New Idaho will become a reality, this I promise. I promise. (gentle instrumental music) (gun bangs) (groaning) (banging) (screaming) (guns banging) - [Harris] What are you smiling at? - Nothing. - Guess I'm not so tough. - It's okay. You're still alive. - What will I do if we get back and Claudia's not there? - [Danielle] Survive. It's all you have to do. You don't have to become like them. - You don't have to worry about that. - [Man] Border Patrol Four, this is Command HQ. Report location and status, over. - [Man] We've proceeded to Fisherman's Cove. No sign of arms merchants, over. - Nope, no fucking Chuck and Iodine around this rat hole. - [Man] Maintain surveillance, over. (wildlife chatters) - [Man] It's quiet out here. I like it. - [Man] We're just wasting our time. - [Man] Get him! (booming) Get him all! (groaning) (guns bang) Over there, over there! (guns bang) - Take them out! (banging) - [Man] On the side! (guns bang) (screaming) (guns bang) - [Man] Come on! (guns bang) (shouting) - [Man] Hard starboard! (guns bang) - [Man] There's one! (gun bangs) (shrieking) - [Man] Aw, you motherfucker. (guns bang) - [Man] Run away, man. (exciting instrumental music) - [Dolores] People approaching on the perimeter. It's Danielle, she's back. Deactivate perimeter defenses. - [Danielle] Hey. - [Merchant] Aw, we missed you. - [Danielle] How ya doing? - [Merchant] Oh, good. - Chuck, hi. - Good to have you back. - Good to be back. We need to talk. Oh, Harris, this is Chuck and Iodine. - Danielle's told me a lot about you guys. - It's good to have you with us, son. - [Harris] Thanks. - Nice to meet ya. - [Harris] Hi. (driving rock music) - [Dolores] Danielle, I'm so glad you're back. I've been trying to look after these boys, but it's not the same without you. We really needed you here to celebrate Chuck's birthday party. - I sure missed you, Dolores. - [Dolores] I missed you, too, Danielle. I was worried you wouldn't make it back alive. (rollicking piano music) - [Iodine] Oh, I win again. This must be my lucky day. Golly, girls, this must be hard on you. (rollicking piano music) - [Harris] Nine. - [Woman] Two of hearts. (rollicking piano music) I'll get you for this, Iodine. (rollicking piano music) Are you sure you're not cheating, Iodine? - April, please. I'm hurt. (rollicking piano music) Come on, Harris, let's go. Come on. - [April] Io! (rollicking piano music) - Okay, nice to have met you. Goodbye. - Bye. - [April] Bye. - [Iodine] What are you doing? (rollicking instrumental music) You ever been trading before, kid? - No, never. - Stick with me, you're gonna have the time of your life. - Sounds good. - [Dolores] Perimeter defenses turned off. Reactivate. Iodine, turn me on, turn me on. - Where are we going? - Did you ever have a secret place, kid? You know, a place where you'd go when you wanna be alone? - Yeah. - Well, this is where I go when I wanna be alone. Come on. (bluesy instrumental music) - Aw, come, hey. - [Women] Happy birthday, Chuckie. - Iodine. Is everyone in on this? What's going on? (exciting rock music) (gun bangs) (groaning) Shit, run! (exciting rock music) (guns bang) - Chuck, the computer! (guns bang) - [Dolores] So, you finally turn me on. (guns bang) - Let's go, get 'em. (guns bang) - [Dolores] Here come the big guns. - Damn it, Dolores, do something! - [Dolores] All right, all right. (guns bang) (booming) - [Chcuk] You can hit the driver! (booming) - The fools! (guns bang) - [Man] Cover him! (guns bang) - Danielle, the biker, waste him! (gun bangs) (shouting) (booming) (guns bang) (booming) (shuddering boom) - Good job, Dolores. Keep up the good work. - [Dolores] Watch out, behind you. (guns bang) (shouting) (booming) (guns bang) - Just come and get it, boys. - [Dolores] Sorry but these boys are mine. (thunderous booms) - They lost. (guns bang) (shouting) - [Man] Pull it off! - [Chuck] I'm out of ammo! I'm empty. - [Danielle] Behind you! (gun bangs) - [Chuck] Here's some. - [Danielle] Damn it, no. Come on, come on! - [Man] Where ya going now, traitors? (laughing) - We thought you were dead. - I was captured and forced into slavery by those scum. - A true warrior would've killed himself before submitting to their will, but no matter, you're still the best arms maker we have. - Thank you, great one. - [Baalca] Where's the other one? - I think I can answer that question. He took off a few days ago with two women and a boy. I heard them say they were going to Dakota. - Take him with us. - [Dolores] Do not enter. This is a defended perimeter. (engine revs) (thunderous boom) (engine revs) - [Harris] That's pretty neat. - [Iodine] Yeah. - Wow. That's an amazing machine. Does Chuck know about this? - Hell no. I figure one of these days, I'll just fly by and scare the shit out of him. Come on, hop in. - [Harris] Yeah? - [Iodine] Sure. - [Harris] Right on. - It's a little sticky. I'm gonna have to work on it a bit. - What was it like before the plague? - It was pretty busy then. People were running all over the place like ants. Things made sense. You had a job, you earned a buck, paid your bills, bought a beer, maybe you got lucky, and then they started dying, first in little bunches, and then in great big bunches. Whole towns disappeared in a matter of months. Craziest thing I ever seen. - So you and Chuck? - Headed for the hills. Yeah, we figured that would be the safest place. People in the cities was, like the went back to the stone ages, killing each other in the streets. - I never heard much about the plague. No one talks about it. - Can't blame them now, can you? Those cannibals you and Danielle ran into the other day, they're all that's left of the cities. They had the plague, the poor buggers, but they didn't die. They just went insane. - It's a crazy world out there, ain't it? - Hmm, sure is. (mystical instrumental music) (whipping) - He confessed, with the foolish hope that he'd save his daughter. You seem concerned, Lucas. - If you could bear children, maybe you could understand. - I don't wish to understand. I am a soldier. - So you are. (screaming) (dark ambient music) - [Danielle] Ah, the queen of the dungeon. You've lost all your men just trying to invite me here. You can't hope to win in the end. - My dear Danielle, how naive you are. - You're just a puppet for the shepherds. (laughs) - You will die for this. You will die slowly. But, first, you will beg for my forgiveness, beg like a dog. (dark ambient music) (groaning) (shrieking) - So you are the infamous foot soldier. While admirable, I do not think even you can break that chain. But I have started to garner a bit of respect for you recently 'cause I heard that you made fools out my troops when they tried to capture you. Time is nigh that you join me. - For what, old man? Target practice? - The choice is yours. - You're all heart. - Not really, but you are, and you are a warrior. You know what a warrior really is? A warrior is born and he lives only to fight. But you could understand my point of view if you wanted to. - Why would I want to? - Power. I can offer you power you never even dreamed of. Didn't you realize that we would expand New Idaho? We had plans before the plague. Many women have carried the seed of the grand one. - I thought all the traitors were killed. (Lucas chuckles) - He who makes the rules can break the rules. Break them. An example of faith from you would let you be a free man. - [Chuck] I always enjoyed being the underdog. - You are. - But for the sake of conversation, what form of faith are we talking about? - Oh, let me ask the gods. You will be given a revolver with one cartridge, and you will kill the maiden Danielle. - Sounds simple enough. - Yes, yes. And then you will finally be redeemed and, uh, you can also join the spirit of the great one at last. - (chuckles) You miserable, misguided son of a bitch. (fleshy thunk) - You had to laugh at me. You and I, we are of the same blood. We're the sons of the Grand Shepherd. But I am the chosen one. (shouting) (guns banging) - [Men] Live! Die, die! Live, live! Die! (shouting) Live, die, die! Live, live! Die! Live, die! Live, die! Die! Live, die! Live, die, live, live, die, die! Live, die, live, die, die! (shouting) - And you said you liked him. - I lied. - I'm gonna look forward to watching you die. - You're a real hero, aren't ya, pal? - Let me kill the motherfucker. - Don't your bulldog mouth overload you cherry-bird ass, sweet cheeks. - Dax, I doubt his tongue will be so loose when he starts to burn. Everyone has their breaking point, even your friend Zak. His was his daughter. Pity we don't get to see yours. - What have you done with Claudia? - The shepherds are attending to her at this moment. She's about to fall into a deep and restful sleep. (whimpering) - Be still, child. You're the one to be with the Grand Shepherd. And you shall give birth but one time, like them. (screams) Leave her be, she's mine alone. Claudia. - Take this, you bulked-up bitch. (booming) - [Man] What's happening? (shouting) (guns bang) - Hey, over here. (guns bang) - [Chuck] Bless his little heart. - And you kicked that kid. - [Chuck] I can't be right all the time. - [Man] Over here! (guns bang) Let's go, come on! Get him, get him.
