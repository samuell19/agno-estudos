You watch too much Russian TV. (slap, clang) I'm not a translator. He... wasn't Maidan! We Russians! - Since when? Since the fascists are traveling here. Almost everyone on the Maidan were not fascists. (Woman) Rebjaty, Fascist... (A guest speaks laughing.) (Mother bangs on the table and speaks vigorously.) (All are silent.) And now they are sitting here. The fascists? I apologize ... for brother... and words. I want to say something. you can me call it a fascist. I deserve it. But not my granddaughter.

I'll have enough rest soon. What are you doing there? - Put on. Why? Good question. Where are we going? We're not going anywhere. - Ah! Adele! (birdsong) (Quiet music) I was company commander the 2nd Cossack Cavalry Squadron. Many Cossacks fought with us. I'm sure you know that. (Lew translated.) That was a disaster. - You fought with the Cossacks? How does that work? (Lew translated.) (The museum director answers.) We were taken by the Soviet government suppressed. Then the Germans came and many Cossacks thought they could set us free. (The museum director continues.) But the Cossacks became killed by the Soviets or sent to the gulag. your family too. The culture has been destroyed. Yes, snay. Yes toshe byl w Gulag. Sjem ljet. Your grandpa was seven years old in a gulag. What? (Museum curator asks a question.) (Lew) What do you want? He's looking for a wife, a Cossack. (Lew) Why? I was Svetlana very... I was very attached to her. (Lew translated.) did you love her Is that the word you're looking for? (Lew translates and the museum director asks something.) When was the last time you saw her? - At the end of the war. When the British captured the Cossack Corps... handed over to the Soviets. (He exhales with a groan.) We got separated. I... (Lew translated.) But did she survive? She sent me a photo. But without a letter. Without address. (Lew translated.) (The museum director speaks.) (Lew) There definitely is a file on them with information. You will too give a file. (The museum director speaks.) (Lew) And he happens to know someone who works in the former KGB archives (Adele) You didn't know about it? - No. Who knows what else will come out. When are you coming? I think I'm scared. Everything is okay in Kiev. I do not mean that. (Lev calls in Russian.) Ah! OK. OK, Yuri. (He continues talking.) That was Yuri. There is no file. How far is it to the Russian border? Where exactly? - Near Lugansk. In Lugansk and Donetsk there's the riots. Also in the country? - I don't believe. What's there? How long would it take? - A day or...

I do not want to talk about it. you never talked And that has its reasons. (Eduard breathes heavily.) (quiet elegiac music) (Beat) German cars good. you better stay here That's safer. He's right. - I agree. I sit in the back. (elegiac music) (In the elegiac music mixes with Russian pop music.) (It's just listening to pop music.) (Lev calls in Russian.) Hm. Everything okay? Boris my brother get in trouble with me (folkloric music from the radio) (news from the radio, Lew makes them louder.) What? - Sh! Russia has taken over Crimea. (The news is to hear more.)

Where the Cossacks were. Yes. with whom you fought. Grandpa? We were further east. (The car door opens.) Can we continue? - Yes. (The engine revs the tires squeak.) (Adele) We're driving to this Cossack village. Where's the village? - (Adele) To the east. Near Lugansk. Why? - I'll come to you. That's not a good idea. - (Uli) Why? Well, the location here is... complicated. What is that supposed to mean: complicated? give me grandpa Here. Mummy. woe, something happens to her! You sent her here. I take care of her. Actually, I got it presented differently. (She sighs.) Dad, bring my daughter back! mmm Ulrike, I... Yes? (quiet, exciting music) We are nearly there. Is correct. Yes, look at the map! Yes.

There was the house. There the barn. (He breathes in gasps.) (brittle) I was billeted there. There was the stable. There were farms everywhere the cossack. behind is the river where we watered the horses. (He breathes shallowly and rapidly.) Once upon a time... the sky was full of dust. Red Army tanks.

Grandpa? - Edward! (Steps) (Chickens cluck.) (Adele) And? (Lev asks in Russian.) It was just a fainting spell. He needs rest. - There. Spasibo. N / A? That was the tombstone from Svetlana's mother. And it said Svetlana's name. But her name is Dudorova, not Agafonova. That's why you could can't find her file. Grandpa ... I think, this is getting too much for you here. So what? (Lew) He's right. It says: "Anna Agafonova, died in 1954, wife of Mikhail Agafonov, died in 1945 mother of Svetlana Mikhailovna Dudorova". Svetlana got married. Yuri's colleague has Svetlana's file found. Ask him if he can also look for Grandpa's file can search. No, Adele, don't do that. Ask him! Please. (He groans briefly and keep calling.) So, we have Svetlana's address. And now Grandpa's file. He's not. (She sighs.) "Last name: Leander, First name: Edward Age: 22, Rank: Captain Unit: 2nd Cossack Cavalry Squadron". Read on! He was sentenced to death.

That you're a war criminal. That's for everyone Cossack officers on record. So it's not true. Grandpa. i try to understand you I want to know, why we are how we are. (She sniffles.) (Steps) If she wants to visit her cousin, she drives over here at night. There is Russia. - Yes. Hm? - Not important. What are you doing there? We drive back to Kyiv. - Oh no, we don't do that. You said, that is too much for me. And you said: "And?" (A cell phone buzzes.) When it gets dark, we're going over there in a boat. Mummy? He's got a file here. They sentenced him to death. (Uli) It's getting worse and worse. - Yes, you can say . Come back to Kyiv. - No. We're going to find that woman now. Where does she live? - Um... not far. 300 km. - Yes, where exactly? Mummy?
