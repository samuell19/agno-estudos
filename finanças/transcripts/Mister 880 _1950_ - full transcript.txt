Transcription: Rosita McCartney Subtitling and Sync: Walter Santos This is counterfeit money. Counterfeiting began a few minutes after the first appearance of currency in the world. It's been going on ever since. It goes on today, but at a rapidly declining rate. The reason for the decline is the efficiency of the US Secret Service, a range of the Treasury Department, the Secret Service is made up of intelligent conscientious men, who work quietly, anonymously, and with lightning effectiveness. Because of their constant vigilance, It is almost impossible for a counterfeiter to remain in business very long without being caught. Sometimes it takes violence, sometimes, arrests are made peacefully, seldom do they fail. Yet, despite all the efforts of their vast organization, there's one counterfeiter ho illuded the Secret Service, longer than any other in their history. It was known as case number 880. As years went and it became the oldest unsolved case, they began to refer to it in a good nature respect for a skillful adversary as Mr. 880. The responsibility for his aprehension fell to the most active of the many Secret Service offices in the country, the one in New York. Because 880's activities were so aggravatingly unprofessional, he had them stumped. To ad to their chagrin, the bills he produced were ridiculously inept. Galagher, if you were a shop keeper, would you accept that as legal tender? I'd have to be blind. Now and then, when patienceran out, they would call in a troubleshooter. An agent from one of their other offices. This time it was Steve Buchanan, from the Los Angeles office. So far it's less than 50 dollars a month. Can't say the man has been greedy. That's why it's been tough to catch him. What's tougher is the one-dolla bill. We never educate people to examine one-dollar bills. Obviously he's an amateur. Come in bond paper and ink you can buy in any stationary store. Take a good look. This is practically insulting. In the past 10 years we've been looking for that pest, this office has arrested and onvicted 1385 counterfeiters. We've broken up some of the most vicious gangs... You don't have to sell yourself to me, Thad. Just selling myself to myself, I guessI think I'm just trying to justify myself. That's what he does to you. May I ask you a question? You have covered every angle... ...and followed up every lead. What makes you think that I can crack this? -I don't... The idea came from Washington. -Washington? Yes, the chief thinks we've gone stale. He thinks it needs a fresh mind. Someone with patience and determination. The chief suggested you. Well, after 4 months with the Butcher Boys, this may come into heading of fun and frolic. I warn you: it won't. Look, if you want out, Steve, I can fix it. Let me kick it around for a couple of days, I might hit on an angle. A couple of days, uh? We've been working on it for ten years, Steve. Yes, I know. OK. Remember I warned you. I know you're busy, but I've been checking all the people who got stuck... Yours is one of the first bills reported. You haven't had any hunches on who it might have been? Well, that was 10 years ago. You say you never caught that guy? No. I got no hunches, mister. Ten years! And waht are you guys been doing all this time? Playing pinnacle? I'll tell you one thing for sure: I never got hooked again. No, sir, not me! Why, you can talk and I'll explain the money. Yes, you could. Whose picture is on the 10-dolla bill? Ten dollars? Sure, that's easy. A president of some kind. -Let me see when I should get one. -Yes, read this. Tells you how to spot counterfeit money. -Good morning, Gus. -Hi, Skipper. Same thing, huh? -Hey, Skipper, here's your change. -Thank you. -Thank you. -Did you see this? -What's that? -A miniature spinning wheel. -Don't look practical to me. -Not practical! -OK, Skipper. -What's your exam on the bill? -Well, Skipper is an old friend of mine. It's ok. -Hi Skipper, how's the junk business? -Junk? What do you mean junk? I deal only with antiques. I'm coming! Oh, Skipper, it's beautiful! -For your mantelplace. -Simply beautiful. My grandmother had one just like it, full size, of course. How much is it? -Three dollars. -Three dollars? It must be worth much more. -What did it cost you? -Me? A pleasant argument with Rosie, two dollars in cash. It's quite an investment. Here's 5 dollars, keep it. Skipper. Look, isn't it sweet? But lonely. I'll ask Rosie to dig up a mate. Heavens! I'll be late! Skipper! Thank you. You always leave your door open, Skipper. Thank you, Maggie. You old rascal! Your door was open. I came in. Why! Bless my soul! Its Doc Duff! Glad to see you, doc! You still owe me that 20 dollars. I came to collect. 20 dollars? Yes. For your dog. I cured him of distemper. Maybe you have forgotten, but I haven't! Oh, yes! And a fine job you did too, Doc. And the dog's got a heart full of gratitude. Has he got 20 bucks? That's a good one. He hasn't, but I have. I'm sorry to keep you waiting, Doc. I really forgot all about it. Oh, go away "Please" Go on! His name is "Please." Funny thing about that. I started out being polite to him, now, he's spoiled. Won't come unless you say please. Damn! I must have spent that money. Oh, yes! Here's 5 dollars on account. I'll let you have the rest... I don't want 5, I want what you owe me! Well I'm sorry, but I haven't got it at the moment. Why do not you sell some of this junk and pay your debts? I couldn't do that. They are old friends! Don't you worry. Ypu'll get paid, Doc. Come back in a couple of days. I give you my word in a couple of days... I had your word last time! You handed me a cock and bull story, about getting it from a rich cousin or somebody! No, that's not a cock and bull story. But you see, I don't like to go asking Henry, except in an emergency. Well,this is an emergency, Mr. Miller! If I don't get that money in the morning, you'll hear from my lawyer! Wow, that's a shame, we shouldn't have kept that poor man waiting. Well, it looks like we gotta go to cousin Henry after all. Come on! Thank you, Henry. Kingsbridge Heights. Kingsbridge Heights. Norwood. Norwood So far so good. Thw subway runs all through here. Any bills turn out at the IRT? Yes, sir. Oh, and here's another one. I'm convinced he still lives in that same neighborhood. When he went to Staten lsland, he left one for the ferry. -Last week he was in... -Flatbush Flatbush. And a bill was reported by the BMT. All this is pretty clever! Give me the next batch, Gallagher. Why don't you save the boy some heartbreak? He's planning to stalk the beast on it's own lair. That would be foolish, I suppose. Sure a waste of brilliant manpower. Another 880 has just been reported. On a taxi standing on Washington Square. The driver, here's his name, knows exactly who gave it to him. He does, uh? It seems like the beast's still down there, Mac. What a break! Gallagher, put all this stuff in the file. Think you need any help? -Could use some. -Mac, go along with him. Come on, chunk, with your brains and my luck this will be a breeze. Please, Thad! I've given a whole year of my life... Mac! Come on! I checked over the house. That's heris name, Ann Winslow. -Ann Winslow, eh? -Yes. There she is now. Come on! -She wants a cab. -You go ahead. -And if she gives me another phony? -Take it! -Hey, I'm already a buck out of it! -This one is on me. -Are you free? -Yes. She's given the taxi driver silver, silver. here she comes. Let me see the bill you just got. The bill you just got, let me see it. This bill is counterfeit. You should spot this stuff. I'll give you a receipt. Counterfeit coins are greasy, you don't bite them, you feel them. Here. -Carlos. -Hi. -There's a rush on it. -Right. -Have you seen Ann, yet? -here she comes now. -I'm finished , Mr. Beddington. -Ah, you did? I typed it all night. I told Carlos I had a rush on it. Thanks, Ann. Where... where is Jack? I'll check it. -Could you move on for these gentlemen? -Certainly. Here are your ear phones. That's the first. If that chick is 880, she must have sterted counterfeiting in grammar school. I'd say about sixth grade. But who said she was 880? But there's a pretty good chance she can lead us right to him. -Ah! Could she? -We've got two choices: we're the shadow of the lady or we cultivate it. -And you like cultivating it, huh? -Naturally. And it's back! One cocktail, there's no percentage of me outnumbered any more. Poor Sir Lancelot. At least drink it slowly and make it last. I don't want to seem ungrateful, but I was quite prepared to deal with the situation myself. -You wouldn't be as half as affected. -Perhaps not. -What's your name? -Ann Winslow. But at least I would find out what a thing like this leads to. -I can tell you. -No, thanks, I'd rather be surprised. -Who are you? Anyone special? -Special? I mean, do you work at anything? Oh, I am a French interpreter at the United Nations. Well... Would you believe this is the first time something like this happen since I've been in New York? I was beginning to wonder about myself. Do'nt tell me you haven't been whistled at? Oh, yes. lots of times, but it's not the same, it's too impersonal. I see what you mean. Yes, I've been whistled at. As a matter of fact, I've done some whistling of my own. In a quiet ladylake way of course. What's your name? Buchanan, Steve Buchanan. Are you anyone special? Just someone out to make a fast buck. Who isn't? Well, I didn't mean that! Neither did you A fast buck doesn't imply deshonesty, does it? What's the matter? -Why? -His way you're staring at me. I'm sorry, it's a habit that he acquired in New York, I stare at people. I keep thinking they look familiar. Comes from seeing too many unfamiliar faces. It's not as twisted as it sounds. You see, in a small town, each face has a definite association that is clearly pitched in your mind. Here a million of them get mixed up in a crazy sort of... Every day I nod to a familiar face that I never saw before. I bet if you have one more drink, the whole thing would become as clear as can be. Hum, might get one modeled. When you were staring at me before, you know what I was hoping? What? That you were whistling in a quiet ladylike way of course. Well, i said I was hoping. -Perhaps I will have another drink. -Great! Things are picking up for Sir Lancelot. And between dances they play soft violin at your table. Would you like that? I'd like it. Here it is. Tomorrow evening, 7:30? -Good night. -Good night. -Carlos! -Now that I see the cause of it -you're forgiven. -I'm sorry, I forgot. -I hope you haven't been waiting long -About an hour, but it doesn't matter. I'm terribly sorry. This fgriend of mine, we just met We happened to bump into each other. This friend of yours certainly does a lot of bumping in the course of a day. Here it is. have 3 copies. He almost knocked me over this morning. Mr. Buchanan? He hit me so hard, I thought it was deliberated. I realize now he probably was in such a hurry to catch up with you. -What do you mean? -He was in the lobby this morning. Right after I left you, remember? -This morning? -He certainly made a beeline for the door. Apparently he did catch up with you. Good night. I beg your pardon, -but I was here yesterday... -Yes, of course, I remember. And I was curious to know what happened when the police... Oh, nothing, he didn't arrest him. Seems he was with the Treasury Department. -Treasury Department? -Yes, Secret Service agent. Showed the police his credentials and they let him go. I thought his behavior was rather strange... -Thank you very much. -Not at all. -Thank you so much. -Bye. Treasury Department Secret Service. REctr 29100 Mr. Beddington -Federal Office Building, Secret Service Division. -Steve Buchanan, please. I want to talk to you. Will you take this to 44, please? Buchanan speaking. Hello! Hello! -Oh, ask them to send it right back. -Yes, sir. Mr. Beddington, when I applied for this job, wasn't I fully checked? Of course you were, why? Can you think of any reason why the USA Secret Service would be after me? They have nothing to do with your job herek. I met a man yesterday... and I just found out he's a Secret Service agent. The two chief functions of the Secret Service are regard the president and catch counterfeiters. I'm safe assuming you're not the president. -I'm suspect of being a counterfeiter? -Chances are a counterfeiter bill fell into your hands and someone reported you. Happened to a friend of mine once. They watched him for a few days, decided he was innocent and suddenly dropped him. Never heard from them again. -So, you'll probably have the same experience. -Thank you. He is a very attractive man, I don't think I'd like to be dropped so soon suddenly. Counterfeiting since 1860. Counterfeit money... one who passes... Come in! The door is unlocked! -Hello. -Remember me? -You are the man girls whistle at. -I had a bad day, not one whistle. -Good evening. -A vision, a veritable vision. Thank you. I'm just about ready. Make yourself at home. -I'll be with you in a minute. -All right. The package arrived but the quality is inferior, you can tell your friend... I'm ready! -Should we go? -Yes. Even to the death, as though you were my blood. In all your quarrels I'll be your knight! -Sir Lancelot said that to Elaine. -Yes. -That's the girl he ditchedo a girl that I found. -He did. By God you're right. And I spent hours last night memorizing it. You know, I just thought of the first two lines of a limerick. I like limericks! There once was a fellow named Lancelot whose girlfriend insisted he danced a lot. He... -If that's a hint, I'll try to control myself. -Well, I wouldn't know how to finish the limerick. It may turn out as a theme for dancing. -That's not real, isn't it? -What? I thought you'd think it was a boodle of queer. I mean it's perfectly obvious what it is. Is there any more wine? A boodle of queer, uh? Excuse me, please. I can ask you if theres a special number? Oh, merci! C'est tr?s gentile a vous de nous trouver. Voulez vous jouer avec beaucoup de sentiment par exemple "Hold Me"? -Madame, it's a pleasure. -Merci. -He's going to play "Hold Me". -You took a hit I love to make a deal. Having fun? I bet you are. Waiter! -Would you mind if I make a phone call? -Not at all. -Can you let me go fix up a little? -Of course I do. This is the third time he's playing "Hold Me" waitingfor us to dance. Well, let's not disappoint the man. -How did you find out who I was? -I believe you told me. -Steve Buchanan, isn't it? -A boodle of queer, -as a boodle hasn't been used since the Civil War -Really? I wonder how I came to use it. You found in a book published in 1870 that you took out of the library this morning. This come from your Michigan bank It's good American currency. You made a good show looking guilty. Why? Seemed silly that you suspected me as a counterfeiter. I thought you could have a cause. You weren't very good at it. I suppose I could be arrested for plotting the law. Yes, you could. Shall we go now? Or shall we finish the dance? I'll call the shots. Until further notice, you'll be held on a technical custody. You passed two of his bills. Where did you get them? -Actually you're ruling me out as a suspect? -I never rule anybody out. I'll assume that for the time being, they fell into your hands by accident. -How? -I don't know. Think back over the past week What did you do? Where did you go? Let me see... I generally ride the subway, except for business. Then, I take a taxi. I have lunch at the cafeteria, tea in the coffee shop. Twice a week I shop at Macy's and Saks and go to a little bookshop at Madison Avenue. Every Friday I have my hair done and on on Tuesdays... I want you to remember where you got one-dollar bills in change. I haven't the faintest notion. They are playing just for us. I'm terribly sorry, Steve, I honestly don't remember. For ten years he followed a definite pattern, going from one section of the map to another, regular order. Let me show you. Flatbush was his last stop, the next one will be Borough Park, then Bay Ridge and then Benson. What about the girl, Steve are you through with her? She's under constant surveillance. I went to Borough Park just yesterday, and the first express stop is on Webster Avenue. You need 30-40 men to cover all neighborhood. Ah, not necessarily, Mac. We found out his behavior follows a definite patter too, he has favorite places, he seems to like a busy drugstore, an automat where there's one, a beer joint, cigar stores. These four have the highest percentage. Now I picked up four pots in Borough Park... -How do we know he's gonna be there? -We don't. We just sit around for hours? For days maybe, praying? -That's the deal. -Holy smokes! -I've played long shots in my time... -All right! Okay! Anybody here's got a sure thing? I'll go along. Look, we haven't had a sure thing about 880, in 10 years and never will have. Go ahead, Steve. I know it's a long shot, Mac, but it would be a shame to waste all this research now, wouldn't it? -Tell me about Coney lsland. -Coney Island! We found out that every year, practically on the same Sunday in the came month, he went to Coney lsland. Let's see, he likes the roller coaster, the fun house and the web. So come next Sunday, if we haven't met him by then, we're all going to Coney lsland. Goody! Goody! OK, let's get back to Borough Park. I briefed the cashiers, if you know that that's worthy. Just won't be bothered by one-dollar bills, so we have to keep our eyes open for anybody that looks suspicious. And you know the kind. The fellow just tries to get out fast and doesn't stop to count his change or in the automat, they want to get their nikels, but never stop to eat. If we have any kind of luck, just the little bit of luck, we'll get him. -No suspicious looking characters, uh? -Only hungry ones. She's a big help! On the first hour, she examined every bill carefully. After that... Look at her! They're all the same. I guess it's a lost cause, Mac. Not for me, I'm doing a research. Every day that girl handles 18240 nickels. -That's worth knowing. -I'll be at the street. Change, please. Remarkable! She never makes a mistake. Fast as a lightning, too. You ought to watch her sometime. Mousie! I didn't pass any stuff no more, Mr. MacIntire, honestly, I ain't. Come over here. Let me see that last bill you got. This is five. Are you sure this is it? Sure, sure. She gave me four singles and the rest in change. -Here it is. -He's right. I remember him. Mousie, why were you running out like that for? You came here to eat, didn't you? I always get nervous when I see you, Mr. MacIntire. OK, Mousie. Hey, Mousie! A phony! In one of the bills she gave me! You got me so nervous! Can you imagine me taking a queer? The guy who shove the stuff wouldn't hang around, would he, Mr. MacIntire? -I'll be on the cigar store. -Okay. Hey! I don't lose that buk, do I? Now you know how it feels, Mousie. Oh, what beautiful dogs! -It's an 880, all right! -He passed one right under my nose. Mac, somebody right in front of him gave this bill. -Do you remember who it was? -The only one I remember is an old geezer Nah! It couldn't have been him. He was a baffled out about his nickle count. -Are you sure? -Yes. He hang around that place too long after showing. You'd better tell the boys in the neighborhood and be sure they are awake. I gotta hand it to you, Steve. I thought you were way off base. -This is the closest we've ever been. -If we stick to the formula, and he should be here any minute. Oh, that's good. Good! Auf wiedersehen. -Hey, do you want to see the parade? -Yes. I do too! Come on! Come on, hurry! Poor 880! He escaped your clutches in Borough Park, but I have a distinct feeling he's doomed. I got the feeling that you're the type that is dogged, -kind of hangs on and on and on until... -I think I finally got it. -God! What? -The rest, listen. There once was a fellow named Lancelot, whose girlfriend insisted he danced a lot. But his armor had a rip in it so bad, that when he was pivoting, the poor guy kept losing his pants a lot. It's wonderful! He stuk to it, then finally he got it, didn't you? A boodle and a queer. I know a great deal about counterfeiting. I read all these books from cover to cover. Incidentally, you never did tell me how you found out who I was. The woman in the art store turned out to be a friend of mine. Oh, say! That is mighty slick. Counterfeiting wasn't a very healthy occupation in the old days, was it? -Those were the counterfeit years! -Know's still. You'd love to see that done today, wouldn't you? Well, who knows might as well be doing it. What are you doing tomorrow? Skipper has to take a flock of kids to the zoo. Skipper? Oh yes, the old boy. He's quite a character. -I promised to go with him. -It's too bad. I have to go to Coney lsland for official business. It's in connection with 880. I thought maybe... Say, do you think Skipper would pass up the zoo, if I take him to Coney Island? I'm sure he would. He'd love it and so will the kids and so would I. If we're going to that movie, we'd better get started. Amazing how much good money there is in circulation! Olie spotted a couple of Mexican quarters. Did you make a pinch? A six-year-old with a nose full of freckles. I'll go check with George. All right, let the lady come on... Step here, don't hesitate! Pull an expert and win a souvenir! -I think I can! -Well, i don't think you can, lady! It's only 25 cents, one quarter, part of the deal! Will be with you in a minute. As soon as I'm finished with the lady. Go on, it's a fake! They faked the scales. Just a minute, sir! Do you say it's a fake? If you say, you gotta give me. I'll say what I'll do! No hands on the scales. No hands on this charming lady! I'll say what this little bundle from heaven weighs. 114 and a half pounds! All right, lady, sit down. Make yourself comfortable! This won't hurt a bit! Let's see... 115 pounds! Yes, sir! I must have some hidden charms! All right! That's 25 cents, one quarter of a dollar! Here you are sir, here's your change -What a racket! -No racket! Now, who's next? This little girl here. Come on little girl, Here you are! -They want to go to the roller coaster. -The roller coaster! Please, I'll be right with you! You want a dog, buddy? That's 25 cents, a quarter of a dollar. Yes sir, you have your turn right away! I guess the weight just by looking! Well, the Coney Island show was a bust! -Let's hope we have better luck at bay Ridge. -Look, Steve, the Borodi case is coming to a head. I'm afraid I'm gonna have to put George and Olie back on it. -Okay. -Mac can go on working with you for a while. He's developed into quite a fan of yours. Look, anytime 880 gets into your hair. I mean anytime -you wanna drop... -Drop it? Why? Well, I don't wanna see you make a career of that, after all there are more important things... There's an outraged citizen outside fromn Coney Island that brought in this 880. He said he could give us a proper description of the passer. No sir! I'm not dropping this yet. I went for a sandwich, you see. I'm counting up and here is this phony boloney! Quick as a flash I knew who this is! The wise guy, you see... There he is! That's him! The dirty crook that called me a fake. How do you like that? He's woitness to me, you see and he said I... Charlie! This crook is already under arrest. Thanks for reporting. He's a very dangerous character. -20 years I've been in... -Well! This is one deliver... Yes. But, he was there, Thad. He was there. He was in Borough Park on schedule. Now, Coney lsland! At least we know we're in the track. In fact, we're one jump ahead him. His next stop is Bay Ridge. And if we don't get him in Bay Ridge, we'll get him in Bed Stuy. -You and Mac can handle this alone. -Sure, sure! Let me handle it. I'll talk to those cashiersand I'll give them a go. They'll never forget it! Where are those cards? One of these will be placed in every cash registers from Bay Ridge to Canarsie. Check. Come on. Hurry up! -Ok. Just a minute. -Thanks. New York... -Hello. -Hello Mary. -Just a moment. -All right. Danke schoen. You have good eyesight. Sure. -Auf Wiedersehen. -Auf Wiedersehen. 25 cents more. Just a moment. ... counterfeit... warning ... how to identify... One dollar... 25 cents. Thank you, Mary. This is yours. Just a moment, sir. Thank you. Hey, wait a minute, sir! Hey you! Hey, Joe! Joe, come here quick! Look, look! Hi, Skipper! Goodbye, Henry. Are you sure you don't want a drink? No thanks. It's a great help knowinghis age and that he's German. I guess it's just a matter of time now. Where we'll go tonight? Can't get away from the idea that he still lives in this neighborhood. Chances are that's where you got those two bills. Don't you ever relax? That old boy... What's his name? Keamel, from the stationary store. -Do you know anything about him? -Nothing. Except that he's asweet old man. -You suspect anybody, don't you? -He's got a German accent. There's a home for the aged around the corner full of old men with accents. -I've already been there. -You haven't! I ould easily learn to dislike you. Hello, Please. Good night, Skipper. Spricht Deutsch? Ii was just a shot in the dark. You ought to be ashamed of yourself! Yes. I knew this would happen. Once he got started, he never quits. -What a waste of talent. -Well, maybe he'll take the assignment overseas. -I told him to think about it. -Ok, I'll take another crak and will call you back later. Right, sir. -Yes, sir. -Is Mr. Buchanan here? -He's in the file room, sir. -I'll get him. Steve! -Hello, Thad. -How are you? Steve, Mac asked to be taken off the case. After all there hasn't been an 880 coming for quite a while now. I guess the old fella wants some action. I sent him with Ollie this morning. They are rounding the Borodi mob. -Should be coming in any minute now. -Anything else? No. How was Washington? Hot. I suppose you'd like to know why the chief send for me. -It's about a deal in France. -France? There is a popular demand for American dollars in Europe right now. A counterfeiter in Marseille is satisfying them. Sounds like big stuff. When you are leaving? Well, I do not know. Chief said if I didn't want the assignment, I didn't have to take it. You take it, Steve. This deal probably involves millions. -880 is a... -880 is a counterfeiter! He's breaking the law. If we can't stop him, we might as well close shut! -Yes? -They have the Borodi here. Okay. I wanna call the attorney's office. Quiet! -Pasquale. -I'm not talking to you! -Giovanni. -Giovanni. -Pasquale. -Hey, Steve! The Borodi, we caught them with right handed with a box of phony tens! -Nice work, Mac. -We got the plates too! Come on! Listen, I don't wanna spend any more time with you, guys. Fine what I say now. You get at the United Nations and you tell what I said! One week of silence, that's what they need! The more job they do, the more arguments they get into. I'm Irish, I know. -Good morning. Good morning. -Somebody's in a big hurry. This got tripped out. I gotta get it fixed. He loves that figure. Miss Winslow, would you come up with me a moment? I wanna show you something. Never remember to lock his door! Look at this room! -What happened? -That statue was the last. I see them going. Piece by piece. Kept him from being lonely those things. He used to make up stories about the kind of homes they came from. All he said was he was living with them annd was nice... Maggie, what did happen? He never really earned enough to live on. Used to get money from his rich cousin until he passed on. -But didn't he leave him anything? -Guess not. I'll never forget how brave Skipper was in his grief. He just said, "I have had to bury cousin Henry." May God bless his soul! I'm sorry to be so late. -Want something? -Not for me, thanks. I've only 2 minutes. -Waiter! -Yes, sir. -How did you make out? -I was a big success. Oh, the check, please. -Yes. I saw the manager. He runs our house and the one next door. He said Skipper could be a sort of handyman. He's very good at fixing things, you know. He said he'd give his rent free and 70 dollars a month. -Isn't that wonderful? -Oh! That's swell, Ann, really swell. -What's your good news? -Something terrific. I couldn't wait to tell you. Well, tell me quickly. I'm going to France. -France? -A big assignment. International style. -Steve, that's exciting! -I haven't been there since the war. -What about 880? -I gave him back to the indians. Ann, do you think there's a chance, well, that you could wangle a trip over? -I don't know, I'll try. -We'd be in Paris together. -Who's gonna work on 880? -I don't know and I don't care. It's peanuts compared to this. Make it and take it, Ann. Employ the old charm. We'll have a great time. I'll take you out to places in Paris. Places you never heard of. Respectable ones, of course. I've only been to the other kind. I hope you liked the schnacke. -I hope you liked the schnacke. -Oh, yes, very good. I'll have start brushing up on my French. I think I'll fly. That is, unless we can go together. In that case, I'd prefer a slow boat. -That isn't German, it's Dutch. -I know. Steve, re you sure you gave 880 back to the indians? Look, I told you before: he's deader than a doornail as far as I'm concerned. Someone once said that a task left undone creates a void that no other achievement can fill. -Who's the imbecile that dreamed that up? -I am! Skipper, you found a mate. Oh, you're a darling! My last transaction in antiques. -Sweet to remember! -On Monday I start a new career. I suppose you've heard about my new job. The news travel so fast I thought it was a presidential appointment. -How much is this one? -They wanted me to start today. I said starting a new career on a Saturday, that doesn't make sense. Skipper, how much? The spinning wheel? -Oh, three dollars, same as last. -Oh, don't be silly. The other one was five. Now, here. When you start something, always start at the beginning. Yeah, starting a new career on a Saturday is just like... Oh, I was sure I had two dollars here some place. I won't take it, Skipper! Oh, they look beautiful together. -I insist on paying the same price! -You will. As soon as I find the two dollars. My new job calls for a celebration. I'm gonna get some things. A bottle of wine, maybe. You're invited! -Skipper. -Huh? Are you sure it was three dollars? For the first one. Oh, the first one. Yes! I put the change in your purse. I see you're having company for lunch. He's invited too. -Good afternoon Mr. Buchanan. -Hello, Maggie. Come in. -Hi. -You're on time. -I like people who are on time. -Well! A banquet! You should have warned me, you know. I'd come prepared with a speech. -Mr. Buchanan, you always come prepared with a speech. -Hey! -Usually a very pretty one. -Ah! That's better. If you'd like, after lunch I'll help you with your French. I had a talk to the Chief. I told him to get himself another boy. I'm staying here. You were right, 880 woul have haunted me for the rest of my life. I'll have to get him out of my system before I tackle anything else. Funny about yesterday. I might be getting sore at him. I do! I was kidding myself. But I didn't like you knowing. I dig you're so smart, uh? Come here, let me see you. Depth in your eyes. Your eyes are muh older and wiser than you are. Steve, if 880 were caught, what would the penalty be? Up to 15 years of prison. -He isn't likely to get the maximum, is he? -If I ever lay my hands on that old crook, that's just what he will get. The experience in Bay Ridge scared him off for a while, but he'll step out again. They always do! I got him pretty well covered everywhere in this neighborhood. I gotta a huntch he'll... Darling, what's the matter? Would you like to talk it out? Hello. Who? Yes, he's here. It's your office. Hello, hello, Thad. Yes, sure. It's just a couple of blocks from here. I know where it is. This may be it, Thad. Thanks! They just got someone passing an 880 at a grocery store. They got him now at thepolice station. I'll phone you. I'll give you a play by play account. Your husband is arrested. -Oh, can't I... -Soon will be out. -Where's the... -Right here. -Hello, son. -Hi. -What's your name? -Bobby. Where did you get this, Bobby? Won it in a crap game from Johnny Sloane, he told me it was a Mccoy. -You know where Johnny lives? -Sure. -I'll take in a prior car. -Fine. -Thank a lot, Lieutenant. -At your orders. Come on, Bobby, let's see Johnny. Good boy. -I got it from Willie. -Speak out. Answer the gentleman I gave him all my bottletops, my special ones. -Willie, huh? -Yes, sir. Thanks, Johnny, madam. Willie! -Willie! -What! Come here. -Where did you get that bill? -I let Mickey play first base and he gave it to me. Mickey is loaded with them. I put some ink in on that tray, you see. I figured it was stage money. So I started making deals with them. Here it is. That's the house! Hold on to this, sergeant. Right here it was. The boys were looking for me, you see. I'm hiding in the back of this push cart. Then this dog comes along and started scraping like mad. And soon I see a handle, so I started shaking all it. -What kind of dog was it? -One of the shaggy ones. You know, the kind with hair on thir eyes, sort of grey one. Thanks, Mickey, you go on back to the car. Stupid old beggar! You can take him home, sergeant. Take good care of the press and I'll pick it up later. Steve! Steve. While I've been waiting for you to come back, I kept telling myself I had to be sensible about this, I had to be practical. I can't, Steve! He is a very old man. One of the kindest human beings I've ever known. Steve, he can't survive a long jail term! He's a counterfeiter. No matter what you or I think of him, he robbed. He reached into his pocket and he robbed. Oh, it's you Ann! Wonderful! You're ahead of me. Wonderful! Thanks Ann! Wonderful! I had a lot of trouble to get the wine I wanted. I said to the man... Why! It's Mr. Buchanan! Wasn't it nice of you two to take my invitation? Yes, indeed! Yes, I said to the man, I said... Now, where's my corkscrew? Oh, thank you, Ann! Here, here, you open it. I'll get the glasses. I said to that man, I said when I asked for that wine I want the... I'll get the glasses. I said to the man, when I asked for that wine, I want the best... "No vinegar in a fancy label" I'm with the US Secret Service, Skipper. He didn't know he was dealing with a connoisseur of fine wines. -Skipper. -Huh? have you been passing counterfeit dolllar bills? Counterfeit bills? Oh, yes, for quite some time now. Wait till you taste this. Secret Service, well, well! Oh, yes, for quite some time! Well, here we go. Down the hatch! Ah, yeah! That's it! -Once you taste it... -Skipper. You have to come down to the office with me. The office? Hum... yes, your office, of course! They probably want to ask me a lot of questions. Let me see... I have some things to do. Oh, yes, Please. I don't suppose they'll let him in. No, no. They don't need interruptions. he can be a nuisance sometimes. Specially in strange places. -I'll take care him, Skipper. -Will you? Thank you! Thank you! In case I am... detained, he likes ground meat once a day. You'll need a lawyer. -I have a friend... -No. Lawyer? No, no, no... We don't wanna bother anybody. Mr. Buchanan and I can just dispose of this without outsiders. Yes, guess there's a lot of details to a thing like this, all sorts of forms to fill out. I hope it won't take long. Wouldn't like to spoil your evening. And Ann... You stay here and behave! Yes, sir, it's true. -I hear they got 880. -Yes, he's inside. Hello? Yes, Mr. Reynolds. -No sir, I wouldn't say that. -Hello, Mac. This is 880? -Well, this is the old geezer from Borough Park! -Yes, and our guest in Coney lsland. They've been asking a lot of questions. You might be able to think of some too. Brother, I could ask a million! -Congratulations! -Thanks. Tell me this, Mr. Miller, did it ever occur to you that this was like stealing? That every person who acepted a counterfeit from you -suffered a loss? -Did you get that, Ms. Gallagher? I was afraid he was talking too fast. What was the question? I was talking about the people who got stuckwith your bills. -I wanted to know if... -Ah, yes, yes! Well, they didn't amount too much! I never gave anyone more than one bill. Made sure about that. -You mean you planned that way? -Oh yes! Yes indeed! And I'd alawys buy something from them. I would make a profit of it on that, so the loss wasn't too great. Less than a dollar. I'm sure nobody minded that. Mr. Miller, I understand you were in the Navy for many years. Machinist. First class. You were eligible to a veteran's home, now instead of committing a crime against your government. Wouldn't you prove to be a better citizen, if you could... Oh, no. Goodness no! I thought about that. I looked up the records. It costs the government US $82.70 a month for each person. I only needed 40, 50. Saved the government a lot of money. Yes, indeed. Quite a lot! He's all yours, Steve. Take him down to the commissioner's for now. Come on, Skipper. I want to thank you. You've been very kind to me. I tried, Ann, but it was no use. He told me I was a nice man but I please would stop annoying him with silly questions. I know. He insists on pleading guilty. I even had difficulty in getting him to accept bail. -Should I ask him to wait? -Yes, please. Aren't you even going to court? Ann, I can't force myself on. Thanks, Jimmy. -You know anything about Judge O'Neil? -Yes. Look Ann, you may as well be prepared. He's gonna have to go to jail. The only hope is to cut the sentence down, maybe to a year or two. A year or two wouldn't be so awful, but I'm afraid... It all depends on the Secret Service office. How hard they push it. -Yes, I know that. -Buchanan can help. Yes, he could. Thank you again, Jimmy. There were so many embarrassing questions that I had to get out of Washington. And all I heard here is what a quaint character he is. That nobody knows what to do about him. -If you saw him, Chief, he's such a harmless... -Harmless? The man drove us crazy for 10 years! Harmless? Well, I'm a quaint character myself, but I know what to do about him. We'll sit with his presecutor for the fullest like any other counterfeiter. Where's Buchanan? I hope he hasn't been bit by the bug. -I don't think so. -Well, where is he? Haven't seen him for the past few days. He asked for some time off. Better turn up at court this morning. He'll be there, Chief. Don't worry. Let's get some breakfast. I couldn't stay away. Oyez! Oyez! oyez! The honorable US Court of the Southern District of New York is now on session. -Good morning. -Good morning. The United States of America versus William Miller! The United States of America? My Goodness! The Secret Service clearly established during the hearing that the bills that the defendant admitted passing, and those turned in to for a period of years bear the same serial number. Your honor, this case has cost the USA Secret Service more time and money than any other case in its entire history. -I would suggest that the defendant... -Oh, I'm sorry! I would suggest that the defendant pay a little more attention. Miss Winslow is a very good friend of mine, sir. -This is more important. -Yes, sir. Before I impose sentence, Mr. Miller, I'll give you another opportunity to get counsel. If so wish, I'll agree to a postponement. If your honor, please, may I approach the bench? I've been asked by his friends to represent the defendant and although he insists he doesn't need me, with the court's approval, I would like to present certain facts to your consideration. -Mr. Miller. -Yes, sir. Will you please tell me just why you feel you have no need for counsel? Well, it seems to me, sir, it seems to me he was going to a heap of trouble for nothing. Aren't you disturbed that you might have to go to jail? Jail? Never been there, judge, and I can't be disturbed by a place I've never been to. You can see for yourself, your honor, that despite his objection... Probably, there are a lot of very nice people there. -Go ahead. -I was going to say, your honor, that despite his objections, someone should speak on his behalf. One thing that does disturb me, judge... -Yes, what is it? -The thing that man read out about the United States of America versus me. I'm afraid that's not true. Goodness! The United States of America! That's a tremendous amount of people to have against you, isn't it? I've got a lot of friends, judge. Some of them are right here in this court. And I'm sure they're not against me. With the ourt's permission, I'd like to continue. Well, you'd better get his permission. Oh, let him go ahead, judge. He's got it on his chest. -Let him get it off. -You see, you have his permission. Well, your honor, he's pleaded guilty so there's nothing more to be said about that. But I respectfully call the court's attention to the fact that the defendant is an old man, 73 years of age. Mr. Lee, I'm sorry if the man is 73 years old, but I've lways dealt severely with counterfeiters as amatter of fact, public policy. I see no reason to depart from that policy merely becuse of his age. -Anything else, Mr. Lee? -Yes, your honor, there is. I think they should be considered the circumstances under which he began his counterfeinting. -He's a junk dealer. -Sure. It's mighty possible that one day, among the things he picked up, -was this printing press and those plates. -No. Naturally arose his curiosity and he decided to -experiment with just as the -No. boy who found it in his back yard experimented, and no one even thought about prosecuting that boy. -No! -Your honer, I don't contend becauser... No, Mr. Lee, you're wrong! Wrong! He's mistaken, judge! Quite mistaken. I bought that printing press. And those plates... I made those plates myself. Yes, indeed. Tooke me quite sometime. It's not easy, you know? No. But I wouldn't want you to have the wrong impression, judge. No. Sorry to contradict you, Mr. Lee. Thank you, our honor. -What you recommend? -No recommendation. Where's Buchanan? Where's the Secret Service man who... -Buchanan? -Hey, your honor. What you recommend? I've never had any sympathy for counterfeiters, your honor. I don't have any now. I agree with the court. A counterfeiter should be dealt with as severely as possible. Thank you, Mr. Buchanan. But, if you please, the court... -There's something I would like to add. -Yes? Well, the defendent is guilty of a crime. I don't think he should be treated as a criminal, as an enemy of society. What he did wasn't because of greed or because he wanted to get rich quick. He printed just a few bills at a time. Only when he needed money badly. And then not always for himself. You arrested this man. Are you now pleading for him? I realize it's unusual, your honor. But the defendant is an unusual man. Ask his neighbors, ask his many friends if they think that Skipper is an enemy of society. I asked that. They know him as kind, gentle, honest human being. You saw an example of that a moment ago when Mr. Lee tried to defend him. It just wouldn't occur to Skipper not to tell the truth. Or even that anybody colred it for him. You don't often find a man with that kind of honesty. Your honor, government agencies are taught to be skeptical. I wasn't satisfied with my own opinion or the opinion of his neighbors. I investigated his past, to see if he was engaged in any other criminal activities. I'm happy to say I couldn't find any. But I did run across something which you might want to consider. The defendant spent a good part of his life in the US Navy. And in 1918, when he was 41 years of age, he received a decoration for bravery. I have a photostatic copy of the citation here. In case you're interested. You seem to have gone throught a great deal of trouble for this man. Why? It's hard to say, your honor. Maybe, I was influenced by something I read the other day. It was in a bookin a book I happen to pick up. "Justice is too often administered by fix rules. Without regard for the fellings of the human mind, or the charity of the human heart." -The book you happen to pick up... -Yes, your honor. -I was the author of that book. -Yes, your honor. Despite that quotation from my book, I still believe that counterfeiters, whoever they are, must be sent to jail. We can't make an exception in this case or in any other case. This man broke the law. However, in view of the defendant extreme age and the other considerations, the sentence will be kept at minimum. Nine months. Thank you, your honor. Yes, thank you indeed. Your honor, may I approach the bench? Thank you, Steve, thank you. -Thank you, Mr. Lee. -In court! I've been advised that the sentence of 9 months does not provide for parole. It's been suggested that it's changed to one year and one day, so that the defendant could get off in four months. The sentence is changed to one year and one day. Thank you, sir. Skipper... Oh, for heaven's sake! I have also been reminded that the sentence must be accompanied by a fine. We will make this one nominal to one dollar fine. One dollar fine. Skipper... Maybe you'd better let me pay. No, no! Let's go. Skipper! Goodbye. I'll come to see you very soon. Transcription: Rosita McCartney Subtitling and Sync: Walter Santos
