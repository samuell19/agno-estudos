Thank you very much Mikel. I'll miss you a lot, fuck. Me too, teeny. What were you thinking of, sending him there alone? 15 years without seeing each other... Is this the only thing you have to tell me? I had no other choice, Peio. Look, I don't know how to take care of a kid I can barely take care of myself. Well, you learn! Do you think it's been easy for me to take care of him alone for 15 years? And when it's your turn You throw him off your side! You are a jerk. I don't know what you've done to him, but he's someone else since he came back. I've come to ask him to forgive me. He was already convinced to go with you, and you messed it all You're crazy to send him there alone. Not alone... Peio. With his father! Peio… I'm dying. Promise me you'll take care of him. That kid doesn't want to know nothing about me. So win him then. He only has you. Fuck Sara, I'm so sorry... Promise me that he will be happy. Promise me you won't let him down. You like this? It's bullshit. Brings me a lot of memories. Here you came to get drunk, huh? Beto? I quit drinking I love you so much my son I ask for your forgiveness You saw how my life was. I was only trying to help you I've been a coward But I was so afraid Afraid of what? Afraid of loving you. Of not being able to take care of you. I want to be with you, Markel. Give me another chance, please
