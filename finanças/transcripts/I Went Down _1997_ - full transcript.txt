How are you ? How long do you have ? Another three months. When you get out-- Anto feels very guilty. He's still your best friend. I need you to tell him that you think it's okay about me and him. Is this a joke ? No. He can't relax. Here. I want to give you this. Will you tell him it's okay ? [ Gate Sliding ] [ Man ] This is your team, and we are going to win the league this year. Look at the prizes, for fuck's sake. Now, you know the score. Tickets, five for a pound. You can get them from me... or at the bar. You okay ? Oh, yes. A bit tired. Just a bit. You know ? - Did Anto-- Was he-- - He was cool. Have you spoken to him ? I haven't spoken to him yet, no. - You going to ? - Yeah. Who's that with him over there ? That's Johnner and Bunny Kelly. Used to live around the corner from me. I'll never forget one Sunday morning. He had a row with his granddad. His granddad, now. He stuck him in the bin. Everyone was afraid to pull him out. The man was in the bin for an hour and a half. 'Course Anto thinks they're great. - You go over to him ? - Yeah. Um, I don't want this. - I don't want it either. - No. It's yours. Whatever about you and Anto, that's nothing to do with you and me. So you keep it. I want you to keep it. Is that cider ? Yeah. Have you not got a drink yet ? No. I'm gonna get one now. Let me get this one. You go and talk to Anto. Okay. [ Man #1 ] It's a free thing. Somebody warned me. And it was my personal responsibility to give him that money. [ Man #2 ] I'm not particularly fuckin' interested in listening... to your financial, uh-- [ Laughs ] You know ? That's the story, Johnner. I just can't get it. [ Johnner ] Well, in my view of it, that's not gonna satisfy anybody. You're not even makin' a fuckin' effort, you know ? What you want to get is someone to help. You look like a dozy bollocks. What can I do ? You can get this for a start. And then we'll take it from there, eh ? Hello. Can I help you there, pal ? How are youse, lads ? There's a thing with Anto, Git. We gotta take care of it. He'll be out to youse in a minute. It's just, you know, he's wanted now. He has to do the raffle. Excuse me. Would you fuck off, please ? Thank you. Don't want to have to put you out, Git. I can't go without him. I mean, I just can't do it. Steo. - There's a lot of people outside. - They know better. - I'm puttin' you out, Git. - Okay. - Okay ? - Okay. - Okay ? - Jesus, Steo ! Come on. [ Anto ] Sorry about this, ya know ? I'd never played before. I thought, you know, I'll bring 50 quid. If we lose it, we lose it, ya know. But that's it, like. I won't come back. All of a sudden I'm ahead, ya know ? Then you lose a bit, win a bit, lose a bit, borrow a bit. Next thing I know, I'm trying to pay the whole thing off. It never got heavy like that before. Swear to God, you saved me in there. [ Door Closes, Footsteps Approach ] Just leave it to me. I'll explain everything, okay ? Okay ? I remember when I was your age. I was probably worse than you. I was a little bollocks. I was the one knacker you didn't want to come near. Forget it. Forget about it. But I was never stupid. And you've been very fuckin' stupid. He made a mistake, Mr. French. He didn't know the score. Anto, I appreciate what you're doing. And you're shittin' your pants. And you don't know what's gonna happen, and that's probably good sense. But at the end of the day, you're an arsehole, and you're the last person I'm gonna listen to, so shut up. Because if I think you're gettin' a smart mouth, I'll kick your head in. Now, you. I'm talkin' to you, Rocky Five. Look at his face. If you don't look at him, I'll break your fuckin' legs. He's lost the eye. You've destroyed his face. What kind of horrible, ugly, desperate bitch... is he gonna end up with ? He'll be lucky if some Arab lets him finger his dog's arse for a fiver. You like that, do ya ? It's just, you know, [ Chuckles ] the way you said it was funny. Steo. Bring him inside. And put Sky Sports on out. I'm sorry. I won't say anything. I'm finished with you anyway. This is between him and me now. I'll wait for you. Now, by rights, and normally, there is no fucking way I'd be sitting here even discussing this. I would have had your eye. He's my wife's sister's boy. I think he's useless, but I can't have this. I can't have the Mulligans hanging out of me bollocks, tryin' to get me to do something. Do you know who Frank Grogan is ? No. Old associate of mine. He was down in Cork, doing a deal for me. Johnner was supposed to go down and pick up the money, but obviously he couldn't because he can't even see now. I would have had another fella do it, but he's doing eight months for contempt. And that Steo's useless. Grogan hasn't got in touch with me. Reckon he's panicked. Think's something's up. I need someone to go down, find him, bring the money back. Mr. French, I'm only out of prison. It's very difficult for me to get involved in something like this. There won't be any problems. All I want you to do is pick someone up... at 3:00 in Gort and take him down to Grogan. Friendly face. Help him out. Reassure him. Johnner handled it very badly. And this is what I need you to do to make it right. Jesus, Mr. French, I'd like to help and get this all out of the way, but it was an accident. If you don't want to do it, don't. Just give me £25,000 and I won't be out of pocket. This is details of where Frank has been for the last few days. Keep the photo. I'll see if Anto can get us a car. I think Anto should stay here. What, here here ? - Don't worry. You've got company. - Who ? [ Tires Screeching ] Bunny Kelly ? Kelly's a good man. I don't think you'll have any problems. Bit of cooperation. He fucks up, it's your fault. You fuck up, it's his. That way I don't have to go around trusting everybody. I've just gotta nip in here for a sec. Shit. Look, this is stupid. Number one, I can see you. Number two, you're moving. And three, I know you're in there. I can see you. You're behind the whatchamacallit. I can see you. Are you gonna let me in ? I can't talk through this. [ Girl ] Hello, Mr. Kelly. How are youse ? Teresa ! Do you know who this friendly face is ? No. - Do you know Grogan ? - I know of him. - It says here he was staying in the Glenwood Hotel. - Okay. But that's out of the picture. I mean, there's no way he's gonna still be there. I don't know. If that's where he's staying. But if he doesn't know what's going on, he'll be moving around, you know ? Ah, that's one theory. Why would he stay in the same place ? Why wouldn't he ? He'd want to keep the head down. He doesn't know what's after happening. He's an old-time fella. I'd say he'd be calm about the whole thing. Yeah, I'm not saying the man's not calm. I'm saying he's not gonna stay where any idiot can find him. - I know what you're saying, but what are you basing this on ? - What do you mean ? - I mean, what are you basing your opinion on ? - Because it's what I'd do. Yeah, but you're not him, are you ? Now, I'm not saying anything. Don't get me wrong. This is not about you. I don't know you. So I have to go on what I do know. What do you mean ? - Well, I mean, you're a young guy. - Yeah, all right. Don't get me wrong. I'm not blaming you for your opinions. If that's what you'd do, fine. But there's more experience on my side that might help us get the job done that bit quicker. - So what do you want to do ? - I want to-- I think I want to see when we get there. Do you know what I mean ? - See when we get there ? - That's the plan. [ Tires Screeching ] [ Kelly ] Get me some fags, will ya ? And something to eat. What are you waiting for ? Hello. How are you ? How's it going ? Not too bad a day now. [ Git ] No. These, these... and, uh, 20 Carrolls, please. - And whatever that is out there. - [ Grunting ] - He hasn't put anything in yet. - What ? Shit. What's the story ? What's it look like ? It looks like you stole this car. Yeah. You go on in and get the smokes. I'll have this off in a minute. He's only waiting on this. Yeah, well, it's not helping anybody, you standing there looking at me, keeping the pressure on, now, is it ? I'm not trying to put pressure on you. Just, he's looking. Any second now he's gonna twig that this is not our car. [ Kelly ] Do you ever remember when you were young ? You could never do anything right when somebody was looking at you. What ? Press in here. Where ? Here. Round the rim. Hard. Aye. That's it. You fill that up. - What are you doing ? - Come in and give us a hand. - Where's your man ? - He's down here. - Aw, fuck ! - Here. Take that. Come on, take it ! Cover him. Where are you going ? Oh, bollocks. [ Whimpering ] - Look, if you move, I'll kill you. - Mm. Had to get the video. He clocked us messing with the cap. He knew the car was hot. He'd have shopped us in a minute. I had to do it. Had to be done. Did you have to rob the place ? Have to dump the car. [ Thunder Crashing ] Could we not have waited till the next town, no ? Nah. Fuck that. Stay too long on that road, what are you gonna do ? Cops see you, you're a snared rabbit. I don't want to hear it. I just-- I don't even want to hear it ! [ Engine Backfires ] [ Engine Backfires ] [ Transmission Slips, Engine Backfires ] [ Pounding ] Try it now. [ Cranking ] You don't know anything about engines, do you ? - Afraid not. No. - Okay, well, you're gonna have to push her. - Excuse me ? - Come on, we don't have all day. Yeah, well, you know, I'll tell you what. I probably wouldn't do it properly. You know what I mean ? I'd probably only fuck it up. So why don't you push the fucking car ? [ Clicking ] Can you get that heater on ? [ Motor Whirring, Fan Blowing ] Oh-- Oh, Jesus ! It's disgusting ! Turn it off ! Will you turn it off ! Not my fault. - We're gonna miss this guy. - Who ? - The friendly face. - "Friendly face." [ Radio: Tuning Between Stations ] Oh, for fuck's sake ! - Is there any chocolate left ? - No. - Is there none left ? - I don't eat chocolate. Well, I have to eat it. I've a little condition. [ Bunny ] Where is it ? [ Git ] Straight across. Jesus ! Bunny ! Bunny ! What are you doing ? - I can't feel the bottom. - For fuck's sake. I'm gonna ruin me shoes. Hello ? "Couldn't wait anymore." Is that it ? We fucked this up. Fuckin' car. Don't worry about it. We'll get Grogan. We don't need this twat. But I'll tell you something. Blaming people isn't worth the paper it's written on. What are you talking about ? How are we gonna get him ? - We'll get him. - We need the friendly face. Bunny ! We need the friendly face ! I'm getting a bit tired of hearing about this friendly fucking face. Why don't you use your initiative and stop acting like a fucking baby. If we mess this up, Tom French is gonna eat us. No guts, no black pudding. I think you know what I'm talking about. That's not an argument ! Stay here and be a boy, then. The men are getting in the car. [ Sighs ] He checked out yesterday. Gotta start somewhere. That's the first rule. There's the pub he drinks in. The Black and Amber. "The Black and Amber." -[ Engine Starts ] - Black and Amber. You're not coming in ? Let's not draw loads of attention to ourselves... like a bunch of fucking monkeys, all right ? I'll see you when you've finished wasting all our fucking time. I'm gonna get a room. Long drive. [ Hinges Squeaking ] [ Git ] Pint of Guinness, please. I don't know if you can help me. I'm looking for a friend. I was supposed to meet him in here a couple of days ago. Just wondering if you'd seen him. He's the one on the left... with the thing on his face. Was he in ? That's 1.78. [ Coins Jingling ] - When was he in ? - A few days ago. A few days ago, eh ? Do you know where he is ? Did he leave a message ? [ Whispering ] There'll be somebody down to you now. Who ? Someone who can help you. [ Jukebox ] ♪ Trouble in mind ♪ I'm blue You looking for Frank ? ♪ But I won't be blue all day ♪ Do you know where he is ? He's in here. He's here ? Yeah. Come on. He's waiting for you. ♪ In my back door someday ♪ Trouble in mind [ Whispering ] ♪ It's true ♪ I've almost lost my mind [ Groans ] ♪ Life ain't worth livin' ♪ Feel like I could die [ Groaning ] If it's not right, we should do it again now. You'll never get it right later. Go again. These fuckers must have Grogan. We're gonna have to try and find him. We could tip off the guards. They must have dislodged your brain, did they ? We get the guards involved here and drag Tom French into this, he'll go fuckin' spare. Whatever you owe him, it'll be like nothin' when he's finished with you. [ Bones Crunch, Git Gasps ] [ Groaning ] No. We're gonna have to do this. How's that ? This might sound mad, but I think you look better now than you used to. You know what I mean ? Here. Saw you didn't have one. I didn't get time to pick one up. How much do I owe you ? You get me next time. What's your story, you and French ? It suits me to do this. What is it ? Debt ? Yeah. A debt. Yeah ? Is that him ? Mm-hmm. [ Car Starts ] Aye, aye. [ Indistinct Conversation ] [ Cat Meows ] Bunny ! Jesus ! - Cool it. It's me. - What are you doing ? I had to make sure it was you. You ever use one before ? No. Never. Know anything about them ? Right. What were you in prison for ? Indecent exposure. - Were you ? - No, I wasn't. Come on, show us. Here. Take it. Heavier than you thought it was going to be, eh ? Fuckin' right. All right now, it's not loaded, so it's safe. But when it is loaded you can't be too careful, so we always leave one chamber empty. Look, the holes where the bullets go, they're called chambers. Right ? Now I'm gonna load it. Right. Now, you push this forward, this comes out. Now we can put the bullets in. I'm only putting in five bullets. - The gun takes six. - A six-shooter. Correct. Now, you see, one of the chambers is empty. And this is the one we leave under the hammer. So when we close the gun-- See ? This is the hammer. This is what hits the bullet and the gun goes off. So what it is, is, if the gun gets jostled, we don't leave a bullet in that chamber. The hammer is on an empty chamber. Right. Now, when you pull the trigger back like this, this bit goes around, and now we have a chamber with a bullet in it. See ? The gun is cocked. Ready to fire. - And the thing goes round. - Yeah. Yeah. Now, that's an old gun. It's in good nick, but it is an old gun. It's been around, so you don't want to get caught with it. - You'll be done for nearly every job since 1977. - I was six. So ? Ah, but seriously, like, every time you fire it, it does become more identifiable. So, to make it worth my while keepin' it, every time you fire it... you owe me, say, 100 quid. - It's not part of the job. - The job ? No way, son. Independent operators. Best way not to get involved. Nothing like a financial arrangement to help keep that bit of distance. That's the way. Now show me how you're gonna use it. What, shoot it ? No, use it. Come on. You're going in with these boys. What are you going to do with it ? You know-- Show them I mean business, you know ? Yeah, well, that's the idea, but you've got to use it to your advantage. You got to use everything you've got. Give you the edge. Know what I mean ? Get down on the ground, you bollocks ! I'll burst your fuckin' head open ! Get down, or I'll blow your bleedin' head off ! Do ya hear me ? Do ya ? Yeah. - You all right ? - Yeah. You see, there's no point in having a gun unless you're going to point it, and there's no point in pointing it unless you're going to make them believe... - that you're fucked up enough to use it. - I think you are fucked up. Now, these will help as well. Aye. I could only get one cool one. That was one me nephew had. [ Hissing ] [ Hissing ] Will you stop looking at me ! [ Snoring ] [ Clicks ] [ Man Groans ] Fuck ! [ Snoring ] That him ? No. Shh. It's okay. You're safe. - What ? - You're safe. Is this a dream ? No. It's real. - We've come to take you back. Is the money here ? - What money ? - The money from the deal. - Don't know. Come on ! Let's get youse up. Where's the money ? [ Toilet Flushes ] [ Alarm Clock Ringing ] Down ! Down, you cunt ! You bollocks ! Get down on the ground ! Get down now ! Stay down, boys, or we start shooting. Where are youse taking me ? [ Git ] Back to Tom French. No ! What are you doing ? [ Groans ] -[ Flies Buzzing ] -[ Bunny ] Oh, Jesus ! What the fuck is that ? Sorry, Frank. This is bollixed ! He didn't want to come with us. You didn't get the money. Says he didn't know anything about it. Bunny, he nearly died when I said Tom French. I'm telling you, if he's nicked the money, he can face the music. It's not our fault. [ Gears Grinding ] I've had a feeling about this, you know ? You know ? [ Git ] He didn't want to come with us. [ Johnner ] Well, of course he didn't want to go with youse... 'cause you made a mess of it. - And you never got Frank's pal, did you ? - We had a few problems. You made a bollocks of it. He doesn't seem to know anything about the money. I don't blame him. I wouldn't tell you couple of clowns anything either. Do you still have him ? Yeah. He's in the-- He's in the car. Frank's bud'll be there again today. Bring Frank to him. Can I speak to Mr. French ? No. No, he's gone out. [ Pounding ] [ Flies Buzzing ] [ Kelly ] Mornin', Frank. I can tell youse now, I don't know what the hell youse are talking about. We understand you can't trust us. That's why we're gonna take you to someone who knows you. It's not that. I honestly don't know what you're talking about. - Why do you think we were sent to get you ? - Tom French ? - Yeah. - Can I have one of those ? No. Look, I don't know if this is some kind of mix-up or what he's after tellin' ya, but there's only one reason he'd wanna give me hassle. - What's that ? - I've been fuckin' his wife for about 18 months. - What ? - That's what I'm telling you. - So what-- What are we-- - Stay there a second, Frank. Come here a minute. Stop payin' attention to that. We have to be very careful here. Do you hear me ? No matter what that loolah says, it doesn't matter. It's none of our business. All we have to do is deliver him, and this is over. I don't care who's fucking who, who's drunk, or what. The less we know about this, the better. Believe me, all right ? These are slippery fucks. Word's no good. Truth's not important. Just the job, okay ? What if he's-- What if he really is--What ? What if he is ? It doesn't change the job. If he wants to fuck Tom French around, that's his business. I'm not gonna drive him around while he does it. You have to ignore him. Don't let him use you. Come on. We have to change the car. Civilization. I'll walk in from here, get fresh wheels. You drive through. Meet me on the far side. [ Telephone Rings ] [ Ringing Continues ] [ Girl ] Hi. Hello ? Is that Carol ? - Caroline. - Uh, hello, love. This is Uncle Bunny. - Who ? - Uncle Bunny, sweetheart. Uh, tell us, is Auntie Teresa there ? Yeah. Well, can I talk to her ? - No. - No. Right. Uh, will you-- Will you do something for me, Caroline ? Will you tell Auntie Teresa that Uncle Bunny loves her ? No. [ Sighs ] Trussed up like a fucking turkey. Will youse believe me if I don't know this guy ? At this stage, I'd believe happiness was a big dick, Frank. You know what I mean ? - What does that mean ? - Don't know. Just said it. Tom French is not gonna do youse boys any favors. Never did anything for anybody. There's a ruthlessness in that man. Even if he liked you-- and he doesn't like anybody. Now, I'm not like that, boys. Sure, I associate with these people. That's my fault. No one else is to blame. I come from a lovely family. They taught me all sorts of decent things... from a very young age. I have a degree. Youse know that ? - Degree in ridin' other blokes' wives ? - Don't say that. Anybody can fall in love. Don't say that. Frank Grogan, B.A. See that ? Education can change your name. Change your life if you let it. - Change your mouth into an arsehole. - Oh, now, that is a real-- That is a real-- What Tom French would say. That's about the level now. But I'll tell youse one thing. And this is the truth. I was working with a couple of young fellas not much older than you, son. Lovely fellas. Cousins. And one day I sent one of them down to the bookie's to throw on a fast bet for me. Won and all, and when I went in to get it... I found out that the girl had had to fill in the docket for him. I mean, the poor fella. And do you know what I did ? I taught them lads how to read. Tom French ? Never occur to him in a million years to do something like that. I taught them fuckers to fuckin' read, for God's sake. You gave them boys something to do while they're banged up... for capers you probably got them involved in, yeah ? Oh, yeah. Big gas. But there's no gift like giving. You can't beat it. And the opportunity can come... and you miss it, and it's gone forever. Now, there's one thing you boys can do... as human beings, for the sake of decency-- - What ? - A few fuckin' clothes, you know ? [ Grogan ] How long have you been workin' for French ? I don't work for him. What ? I'm like you, Frank. I don't have a choice. Do you owe him money ? Well, that's the big question, isn't it ? If there isn't any, you know ? There isn't. How did you get involved with French's wife ? Known them for years. I was at their wedding, for fuck's sake. We used to work together.Yeah ? Long time ago-- the days of Sonny Mulligan. What happened to him ? That's the whole point. - Nobody knows. - Just vanished ? You hear different stories. I don't know. Probably living in the Caribbean. Millionaire gangster. Suckin' a cocktail. Someone suckin' his cock. True gentleman he was. A gent. Is he French's boy ? [ Git ] Don't think so. You don't know him ? This fella you're takin' me to. What if he's got plans to, you know, take care of me-- in a bad sense ? You feel all right about that ? I don't think I'd just let something like that happen, Frank. I'm depending on you then. [ Shop's Bell Rings ] Do you hear me ? - I'm only used to the very best. - They only stock the best. Youse are fuckin' bastards. - Didn't even get me a pair of shoes. - Nearly forgot. What do you think of these ? - Aye, they should do the job. - No. These are for me. - What am I gonna wear ? - You can have these ones. [ Grogan ] Did you ever make love to a gangster's wife ? Jesus. You can't really enjoy yourself. I mean, no, no. I'm not saying-- I mean, she's a smashing little bird, French's missus. I don't really want to hear this, Frank. Do anything to you. Do anything. And there you are, relaxing. Perfectly within your rights-- Two consenting adults having intercourse. I don't want to hear this. And human contact. Very nice. But all the time like, like, you're just waiting-- just waiting for them to catch up with you. You've no idea. The fear. It's like making love with the angel of death fucking sitting on your-- Would you fucking shut up ! You're jabbering away there like, like, like a fucking idiot. I mean, the fucking thing is, like, you know, I mean, we don't know, one, if you're bullshitting us; two, if you're lying; three, what the fuck is going on. So just give it a rest, all right ? Cool your jets. I'm only talking. All you fucking do is talk ! Bunny. You know, like, I mean, I'm that close from putting you back in the fucking boot. And you can fucking stay there ! Bunny ! Bunny, look ! Undo his hands, quick. Quick ! [ Radio Chatter, Indistinct ] Give us a minute, men. Nothing serious. Are youse local ? No, just passing through. Couple of days off. Well for you. Yeah. You know your tags is two months out ? I know, Guard. It's a company car, you know. I've been after them for weeks. You want to get it sorted out. Save yourself the hassle. Yeah. They were the same with me last year. Ended up paying it myself. Easier in the long run. Get them to reimburse you. Yeah. I'll-I'll probably do that. Hmm. Where youse headed ? Uh, his auntie. Where is it, Mick ? Ennis. Ah, you'll be there in about three quarters of an hour. Not the way he drives, Guard. [ Chuckling ] Is that right, yeah ? - You've a bit of Cork ? - Family down there. - You can hear it. - Where are you from yourself ? Originally from Claire. Ennis, actually. Would I know your relations ? - Ah, she only moved there last year. - Is that right ? [ Horn Honks ] [ Kelly ] Think we're okay now. Okay, well, good luck, boys. Thanks, Guard. Thanks very much. All the best. Now, huh ? Who's on whose side now ? What ? After me being brilliant with the guard and everything ? [ Git ] What if he doesn't know this bloke ? [ Kelly ] Then he might be telling the truth, you know ? But I mean, I wouldn't put it past this "geebag" to let on he doesn't know him. Get out of paying what he owes. Do you see what I'm saying ? I don't trust him, Git. This job-- clear your debts with French ? You must be joking. Sometimes feel as if I'm gonna be beholden to that fucker the rest of me days. Would you not just go somewhere ? Away from him, like ? Ah, you can't just drop things. Anyway, it's not just up to me. You know, the missus and all that. You know ? [ Kelly ] It's never that easy. [ Kelly Sighs ] Fuckin' place. I'm not going over that bog again. You bring him over. Don't fall into any fuckin' holes. I'm gonna check it out first. Ah, for fuck's sake ! How are ya ? You with Frank ? Yeah. - You know him, yeah ? - Oh, yeah. Frank, yeah. I'll take it from here. Okay. I'll get him. Look. If there's any trouble-- What trouble ? Bring him over, dump him, come back, we go home. What ? I sort of said I wouldn't leave him if-- What did I tell you ? What did I say to you ? - I know. - Look, these shits will do anything to get their way. Now, you take that bastard over there, cash on delivery. You're back here, two minutes, or I'm gone. 'Cause you love him so much, you're welcome to him. Now do it. Just do it, huh ? That's all there is for you ? That's all there is, chicolito, and I'll tell you why. One, there's no room for anything else. Two, you've got to leave-- and this is quite fucking simple-- you've got to leave room for yourself. Three-- Jesus, Bunny ! You're just like him. It's all mouth. I mean, what if that was you in the boot of that car ? I don't care. Do you see ? No. I don't. Where is he ? Come on. We've got to go across here. I've never been here before. I don't know this place is what I'm saying. Look, please, don't make me go in there. Look, I won't leave you. We'll see who's here. You promise ? [ Knocking ] - [ Git ] How are ya ? - All right. I don't know him. [ Git ] Do you know Frank ? I don't, no. The fella who was supposed to be here yesterday couldn't come today. - What's his name ? - I don't know. 'Cause, you see, I'm supposed to hand Frank over to a friendly face. - You don't like my face ? - What ? I'm just telling you what I'm supposed to do. You hang around, you know, and you're gonna give me a problem here. - Be on your conscience forever if you leave me. - Makes no odds to me. Both of you, in. I told you this. Where's your-- Yeah, I think I'd like to see that as well. Slowly. Throw it over there. Inside. Kneel down on the tarp. You ! Look, there's no need for this. Just do it ! Look, what-whatever you're getting-- W-What are you getting ? Five ? Ten ? Twenty ? I'll give you fifty. I'll give you fifty grand if you let me walk away from this. We can go to my bank tomorrow. What'll you give me ? I don't have anything. Fuck him. This is you and me. Forget about him. He's got nothing to do with any deal that we make. Okay. -[ Gun Cocks ] - There better be a very good... expli-fucking-nation for this. [ Sighs ] Bunny, thank God. Talk to this maniac. Drop it ! Now ! Git. Get up and come on. What about me ? You're not my problem. Two of youse can go to your bank. See youse around. I-I-I was just buying time. I knew you were gonna come through for us. Great, you know. Fuck you. Think about it. I buy my way out of this, I'm still at large. Do you think Tom French is gonna be happy with your work ? It's not our fault. We're not letting you go. -Charles Bronson is. - I can get you a good thing here. Face it, Frank. You blew it. I can get Tom French off your back for good. 'Cause you're shaggin' his wife ? I don't think so. There's some money that we have to sort out. Oh, really ? I wouldn't have thought that, now. Ah, I know. I know. Big joke. But this is the truth. I can sort us out. Bunny, can I talk to you for a sec ? I mean it. - All I need is a phone. - [ Whispering ] There's two things here. He buys his way out of whatever this is, he's right. We'll get the fuckin' blame. - All everybody's been doing is lying to us. -[ Floorboard Creaks ] But we hang on to him, do this on our terms, and we can walk away. 'Cause French wants this bad. I say we stop fucking around and use this bastard. Who do you want to ring ? Who do you think ? Uh, that would help me, actually. If I can get someone on my behalf-- That this isn't my fault-- - I have a mobile. - I don't fuckin' believe this. It's in my car. [ Kelly ] How'd you get your car in here ? What do you mean ? We're parked across the bog. Why are you on the back road ? Well, it's more scenic, isn't it ? Give him the keys. Put him in first class. Get in. [ Grogan ] I had a plate. A plate for printing one side of a 20-dollar note. Got it cheap, years ago. But I mean, what use are one-sided forgeries ? So since then, I've been trying to see... if I can't get anyone to get me the other side, to do the backs. Couldn't, could I ? Then all of a sudden, Tom French gets the other side. Now, I go way back with Tom French. We used to work together. - So I offer-- - This is about Sonny Mulligan ? Ah, no, no. This is years ago. This is nothing to do with Sonny. Me and Tom French have been more or less out of touch since Sonny went. We had a falling out over a certain lady friend. I rang him up. You know, let bygones be bygones. And offered to buy his side of, you know, the other plate. Tom French is having none of it. He's too greedy. He wants them both. And he offers to buy my one for five grand. I ask you ! So I go, "Bollocks. No way." 'Cause now we know that the other one at least exists, it's worth far more than that. So it's like, um, "I've arsed around with this long enough. I'll sell it." But not for any five grand. No problem finding a higher bidder. This bloke in London-- Ten grand, thank you very much. But before I can ring this other bloke, Tom French rings me again. He's found a buyer for the both plates. A hundred grand, and he can give me twenty-five up front... as a goodwill fucking gesture. So I say okay, as long as his wife brings the money down. So, there I am waiting in the Glenwood... to do the deal with his missus, and she never shows. - Wait a minute. Wait a minute. What ? - What do you mean, what ? What do ya think I mean ? I mean, "What ?" - What ? You mean, the whole thing, "What ?" - [ Snickers ] It's a fairly simple question. What are you-- What did you have... that... time ? Ya fuckin' da brain. [ Phone Ringing ] [ Ringing Continues ] [ Receiver Picks Up ] Mr. French, please. Who is it ?Git. Yeah ? Frank's pal wanted to kill him. Have you still got him ? Yeah. What do you want to do ? Make a deal where no one gets killed, if that's okay by you. Ask Frank if he wants to do what Sonny might have wanted. He wants to know if you want to do what Sonny might have wanted. When ? When ? In the morning. He'll know where to go. What about Anto ? By the time we meet, he'll be tucked up with his girlfriend. How will you be paying, Mr... Guinness ? Cash. I think. Oh, Jesus, lads, I would've thought that by this stage... this would be a little bit unnecessary. Well, we really need a little break from you, Frank. And this way you can have a little kip, watch the box, whatever. - W-What are you boys doin' ? - Well, it'd be a shame to waste the facilities. What if I need to go to the toilet ? You should've gone before we came out. [ Channel Changes ] [ Groans ] [ Channel Changes ] When we first met complex numbers... we said that every quadratic equation had two roots. We're going to prove that. In fact, we're going to prove something much more ambitious, something that goes by the grand title of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra. [ Grunting ] Now, that's a bit of a mouthful. What does it mean ? Well-- This mate of yours, a good mate, huh ? Yeah. Best mates since we were six. And, uh, as well, like, he's, uh-- he's seein' this girl I used to be with. That's tough. I just wanna get this over with. Get away, you know ? - Where would you go, then ? - Don't know. - States. Don't care. - The States is brilliant. - You been there ? - Yeah-- Uh, no. Just on the telly. You're a fuckin' chancer. - What do you think about this tomorrow ? - You askin' me ? Don't get smart. Come on. Chance to find out what-- Only chance to get out of this, for fuck's sake. - I mean, what the fuck are we into here ? - [ Sighs ] We're up to our bollocks in some real old-time gangster fucking row. "I'm ridin' your wife." "You're wearin' my wig." "I had Sonny Mulligan's dick up my arse two nights on the trot in 1971." You know what I mean ? Yeah. Saps. - Do you want another one ? - Another one ? Can we get another two, please ? [ Grunting ] So, in order to see... what sort of pictures we're going to need for the proof, here's Colin. We already have an excellent picture for complex numbers... as points of the complex plane. I'm not educated like the folk out there, you know, but I have a theory about the ladies. See, a good-looking bird, she's gone around all her life... blokes lookin' at her, comin' on to her, tryin' to fuck her. Pretty soon she's gonna have the opinion that life is full of romance. At work. In the pub. Life is basically full of romantic fuckin', you know, sex. You know ? Yeah. That's the way she sees life, mmm ? Yeah, well, an ugly bird... goes through life more balanced. No chance of a ride. Forgets about it. The proper outlook, you know. "I'm not treatin' everybody like I'm some bitch doesn't have to make the effort... "because my tits... give me a license to... whatever." You know what I mean ? Uh, what's the-- Well, I'm still workin' on the theory, but... it's a thing about... maybe ugly birds are better. Hmm ? How long have you been married ? Twelve years. Yeah, you know, I was trying to-- She's been stayin' at her sister's. Just for a little while. You start fuckin' thinking. Armed robbery. I did six and a half years. You can't, you know. You lose-- You lose a lot of, um-- There was a-- There was a man. [ Clears Throat ] A man I shared a cell with for two or three months. Um... what went on, i-it wasn't full-- I'm bein' frank with ya here now. Not that Frank. Not Frank upstairs frank. I'm not a queer, you know, but Tom French says he'll tell and... me wife doesn't know. And that'd tear it. That'd fuck it up. - I haven't told anybody else about this. - Don't worry about it. Oh, I don't know. I sometimes feel as if that cunt is all over me, all over the fuckin' place. Been a while ? [ Sighs ] I'm only out two days, man. I'd have the arse ridden off that quicker than you'd get your glasses off for a Taig. Yeah ? [ Sighs, Sniffs ] Whoa. What are you doin' ? What do you think I'm doin' ? Oh, Bunny. ♪ [ Rock ] ♪ [ Continues ] - Do you ever talk ? - [ Sighs ] Yeah. What do you say ? I say things like, "Are we goin' to the shops ?" That type of thing. You're afraid I'm gonna find something out. - Yeah ? - That I'm gonna have somethin' on you. Isn't that it ? Because, you know, I've already got something. Yeah ? What have you got ? Squeeze my thumb as hard as you can. As hard as you can. Okay, now squeeze it with the other hand. Now... What ? - I know something about you. - What ? I know what hand you wank with. - [ Snickers ] Did you make that up ? - Are you all embarrassed ? Yeah. Of course I'm all embarrassed. It suits you. [ Sighs ] Jesus, Bun, she's gone to get a room. You dirty little bastard. How would it be if I was to see you in the mornin' ? You know, Frank and that. You leave Frank to me. Ah, you're a star. You're gettin' a hard-on there. Don't look at it !

He was ill all his life. Emphysema. Couldn't work with that. He loved his drink. But a terrible, messy fuckin' drinker. And so I took him out, lashed a few scoops back. I was walkin' home with him when we saw these c-- these fellas ram-raid a shop. Alarms going, the works. They grabbed hi-fis and all this... and into the car and off they went. And this fuckin' idiot beside me... says he wants a video. Walks into the shop, picks one up. I was tryin' to get him to put it down when the cops came and snared us. And, uh, I said I'd done it. Why ? He was... me da. You know ? He couldn't have, so I said it was me. Went up before this bollocks of a judge. Sent me down for eight months. And then two weeks later I got word. The old fella kicked it anyway. Waste of fuckin' time. And I was gettin' a loan with me girlfriend. We had plans. We couldn't get it then because of me. So, that's how I lost me girlfriend. - Did ya not tell her the truth ? - Nah. And blame a poor dead fella ? That's worse. Nah. I made me commitments. Head down, and now I'm out. Yeah. You're at large. Oh, shit. What were you doin' ? Same as you. Excuse me. Excuse me. Sorry, love. We're in a hurry. Could you settle your bill, please ? It's paid in advance. This is phone calls. - Sorry ? - There's three phone calls made from your room. That fuckin' motormouthed-- Fuckin'-- We're not payin' for his calls. - How much is it ? - 2.80. Cheap fuckin'-- Could I query this ? - Of course. - You not gonna pay it. Just wanna look at the numbers. We can't have time for this. I'll be one second. Two local calls and one, it's a Cork number. - Right, he's in Cork. Come on. - Do you recognize these local numbers ? - This is a local taxi company. - Come on ! And this, I think it's the Slieve Na Vogue-- a hotel about five miles toward Mullingar. We're gonna kill him. Show. [ Whispering ] "Pat Shanks... B.A." Ahh.

Better take this. - Bun, I can't be doin' this. - It's nothin'. It's just to put them off. - But what if I hit something ? - It's just a warning, Git. Jesus, Bunny. All right, they're comin'. Just do what you done in the car park, all right ? Are you gonna do it ? - [ Man Shouts ] - Shit ! Jesus Christ, come on ! They're gonna kill us all ! You don't have to kill 'em, for fuck's sake !

We'll sort it out when it's all over. Huh ? - You know. What we agreed. - About what ? Don't make me do this. You pay what you shoot. Six hundred. Are you joking ? Why would I joke about somethin' like that ? I only make a joke when it's really funny. You should know that about me. You were tellin' me to shoot. No, I was telling you to do what the right thing was in that situation. - To shoot the gun. - That's what the right thing happened to be. But it doesn't affect our arrangement, which you freely entered into. I don't want to be teaching you about ethics on top of everything else. Please don't make me do that. Okay ? Okay ?

[ Sighs ] I never wanted to be any trouble, but life just goes like that, you know. There's all sorts of things. We have to walk from here. What is this ? Me and Tom French have things hidden in these woods. That's what we're here to do. That's the simple beauty of it. This is it. [ Kelly ] Where is he ? [ Grogan ] He'll be here. You gettin' nervous ?

Ah, the famous plates. Frank's a nice fella, but you can't believe a word he says. So you learn to hate him for your own good. He said something about your wife. I don't want to be rude, but that's between me and her. This is it. I'm fucked if I'm diggin'. You're young. Give us a fag. - What is it ? - About two foot down there's a suitcase.

You just-- You don't talk to anybody. What do you do ? What's in your life ? Things like this ? Just tryin' to stay out of the way. That's where you're wrong, you see.

Ah, it's the luck of the draw. It's just gas. Hope you lads are payin' attention. See what money does to people. It tears 'em apart. Never known money to bring people together, and that's the truth. [ French ] Now, that's an odd combination, Frank-- you and the truth. This is it. I don't dig. Git's got the spade. Is it far down ? No, it's not far. [ Grogan ] Soil settles, huh ? There's something here. [ Grogan ] That's right. There's something else here. Oh, Jesus ! [ Grogan ] That's that, then. [ Grogan ] Sonny Mulligan. [ Kelly ] What happened ? - Money. - Clash of personalities. - Not with Sonny. - No. Sonny was a gent. Yeah ! Yee-hee ! Fuckin' money ! [ French ] The counterfeit plates were Sonny's retirement plan. Finest plates ever made. Never seen craftsmanship like it. He'd hired them from the big boys across the water... on condition he wouldn't print more than 50 grand. [ Grogan ] Twenty-five years ago we were one of the most successful gangs around. We were very close. We had it all. Tom even married Sonny's niece, and I let him. [ French ] But we blew it. We wanted him to print more than 50 grand. I had a blazing row about it the week before he died, right in the middle of me own fuckin' wedding, all Sonny's pals there and all. [ Grogan ] So we had the fantastic brain wave of borrowin' the plates... and printing our own sneaky batch. [ French ] He always kept one on him. I saw where he buried the other one. Plan was, we'd print one side, do the other later. [ Grogan ] If he knew what we were doin', well, you could forget about it. [ French ] The Mulligans wanted to know what happened to Sonny, the big boys wanted their plates back, so we said Sonny had ripped us off and disappeared. There was a lot of heat. We were very lucky not to be killed ourselves. [ Grogan ] And then, to top it all, Tom caught me in bed with his wife. We couldn't even breathe the same air anymore, let alone do a deal. Right up to here we are, a quarter of a century later. [ Kelly ] Poor cunt lyin' out here in the cold all these years. He was a prick. Let's burn that and fuck off. [ Chamber Clicks ] What are you doin' ? Where is she ? Who ? Don't... fuck me around. - Where is she ? - Where's my 25 grand ? Just stop the shit, Frank. Where is she ? She never showed. I swear to God, Tom, she never came. She did youse both. I'm fuckin' delighted. That gun's not gonna work after 23 years. I like a gamble. Tom. That's for Sonny. - And this is for fucking my wife. - [ Gunshot ] - Where are youse two goin' ? - Just do it, if you're gonna do it. Oh. Is the faggot gettin' all catty ? I'm not that ! [ Click ] - You're not anything. - [ Gunshot ] I didn't know I was the type. What ? About to shit in me pants. Why didn't you hit him the first time ? Empty chamber. What were you doin' with an empty chamber ? - You told me always to leave one. - No, I didn't. I'm not arguin' with you. You're a cunt. Git. What ? How much did Frank say we'd get for these ? Well, I reckon you'll be able to get another pair of those white shoes. You don't think a man would only have one pair of shoes like them, do ya ? Are you jokin' ? No. You'll know when I'm jokin', 'cause it'll be really funny. [ Panting ] Come on, Bunny. You gotta stay awake. We've gotta get you sorted out. Come on, keep it together. [ Grunting ] Okay. [ Shivering ] Where you goin' after this ? Come on. What's the plan, huh ? [ Continues Shivering ] Where are you going ? You're not comin' with me. Did I say I was ? I've things to do. You wanna get sorted out goin' to the hospital before you do anything. I suppose. What am I gonna tell them ? I'll say I did it. Will ya ? Would you fuck off ! Ah, I'll get some backstreet cunt. I don't feel that bad anyway. I could drink a pint. Could ya ? Do ya fancy one ? Don't mind. Where are you livin' ? B and B. There's room in my house if you want, till you get sorted out. Jesus. You'll have a room of your own, 30 pound a week. Not too shabby. There's a hundred grand's worth in this case, and you're tryin' to get thirty quid off of me. Yeah, well, I always said if I ever got rich I'd never change. [ Shivering ] You know, I'm gonna-- I'm gonna stick to it. You're brilliant. Yep. [ Snooker Balls Clacking ] Thanks for comin'. It's all right. - I haven't seen you around for a while. - I've been very busy. - Thinkin' of goin' away. - Where you goin' ? - States. - States is brilliant. - You been there before ? - No. First time. Do you know where Git went ? Here. What is it ? - Put it away. - What is it ? - Put it away. - What is it ? - Would ya put the fuckin' thing away when I tell ya, please ? - What is it ? - A little few bob for you and him to burn. - A few bob. - I know. - From who ? - You know who. Don't make me say it. - Git ? - I think that might be how it is, yes. - Where is he ? - He's gone away. States. - Do you think he knows anything about where Tom French is ? - Why would he know ? Anto told me he was going to do something for him to help Anto with a debt. Well, I think he might have done that, all right. I heard it around. I just bumped into him. He asked me to give you that. - You don't think he was involved ? - You must be jokin', love. Tom French done an insurance scam and fucked off. He did a Sonny Mulligan on it. Bunny. Wait. If you do bump into him, will you give him this for me ? I don't know, love, but I'll tell you this much: Whatever happens over the coming years, you be ready to forgive your man, 'cause sometimes the benefit of the doubt can even save your life. I'm learnin' that. So many men think so highly of you, might be hard for you to see which one is the one that's gonna light up... just from hearing your name. But I've met him. So have you. [ Man ] The white one, it is. [ Anto ] Relax, will ya. What's your problem, man ? Liar. Jesus Christ. Here, boy. I'm watchin'. - How'd it go ? - Jeez, kid, not too good. But I managed to get this back off her. I didn't want it. I wanted her to have it. You fuckin' moron. Gonna miss the plane. What the fuck am I doin' ? Do you mind if I ask you something ? Depends what it is. Remember that bird you were with that night in the hotel ? Yeah. Did she suck your cock ? That's what's been on your mind ? Well, you know, I reflect. Did she ? Yeah.
