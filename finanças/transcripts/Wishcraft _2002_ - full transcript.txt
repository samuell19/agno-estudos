PERHAPS, WITH A SERRATED BLADE, LIKE A SURVIVAL KNIFE. SO, YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT THE KILLER HAD A SWORD... BUT HE DECAPITATED HIM WITH A SURVIVAL KNIFE ? SPARKY, THE SWORD WAS ALREADY IN USE.

WE WERE TIGHT, WE WERE LIKE THIS. I JUST THOUGHT THAT... WELL, I SHOULD REALLY GO AND TALK TO MISS LAPINSKI, BECAUSE SHE COULD HOLD ME AND TELL ME IT'S OK. AND THAT JIMBO'S IN A GOOD PLACE.

ALL RIGHT, I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING AND I WAS HOME LAST NIGHT. THAT'S FUNNY. YOUR OLD MAN DIDN'T SEE YOU WHEN HE CAME HOME FROM WORK, NOW, DID HE ? YOU DIDN'T COUNT ON THAT ONE, DID YOU ? GET HIM OUT OF HERE. I'M GOING TO READ YOU YOUR RIGHTS NOW. YOU'VE GOT THE RIGHT... MR. DOMBROWSKI ! YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO REMAIN SILENT. ANYTHING YOU SAY... I GOTTA TYPE INTO MY COMPUTER. SHUT UP. ( people chattering ) ( female reporter ) WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THE SUSPECT ? EDWARD ROBARBS IS 18. SENIOR AT VAN BUREN HIGH SCHOOL. HE'S A KNOWN RIVAL OF BOTH VICTIMS, AND RECENTLY HAD CONFRONTATIONS WITH BOTH OF THEM. SO ARE YOU CONSIDERING THIS INVESTIGATION CLOSED ? WE THINK WE'VE GOT OUR MAN, BUT, UH... I WOULD SAY THAT OUR INVESTIGATION IS ONGOING. ( people chattering ) GUYS... USUALLY DON'T GO TO FOREIGN MOVIES. THAT WAS COOL. IT'S A LOT OF WORK. YOU HAVE TO EARN YOUR MOVIE. ( laughing ) ( sighing ) TOO MUCH WORK FOR CODY. HE WOULD NEVER SIT THROUGH A MOVIE WITH SUBTITLES. WHY DID YOU GO OUT WITH CODY IN THE FIRST PLACE ? UH... I DON'T KNOW. I... JUST SORT OF HAPPENED. BUT LATELY, I REALIZED THAT I DON'T THINK HE WAS REALLY THAT INTERESTED IN ME, OR... WHAT I WANTED. AND I'M REALLY PROUD OF THE DECISION THAT I MADE. CHOOSING TO BE WITH YOU. ( sighing ) I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. WAS YOUR MEAL SATISFACTORY, SIR ? YEAH, IT WAS FINE, DESIREE. THANKS. WHAT ARE YOU DOING ? WHAT DO YOU MEAN ? I JUST THOUGHT YOU WERE COOL. IT'S PRETTY WEIRD THAT YOU GUYS ARE TOGETHER. IT'S REAL WEIRD. ( crickets chirping ) ( Samantha ) BRETT. BRETT. ( laughing ) AREN'T YOU COMING BACK HERE ? ARE YOU OK ? YEAH, I'M FINE. ARE YOU SURE ? YEAH. NO. I'M FINE. WHAT IS IT ? I JUST FEEL LIKE I'M TAKING ADVANTAGE OF YOU. ( laughing ) TAKING ADVANTAGE OF ME ? BRETT, YOU ARE THE NICEST, MOST CONSIDERATE, HONEST GUY THAT I KNOW. ( laughing ) TAKING ADVANTAGE OF ME ? ( laughing ) I JUST HOPE YOU DON'T THINK THAT I'M TAKING ADVANTAGE OF YOU. I MEAN, I CALL YOU ALL THE TIME. NO, I JUST-- GOOD. BECAUSE I DON'T THINK "TAKING ADVANTAGE" APPLIES WHEN 2 PEOPLE REALLY LIKE EACH OTHER. ( clearing throat ) ( sighing ) ( rattling ) ( clearing throat ) ( gasping ) ( gasping ) ( spraying ) ( gasping ) ( police radio chattering ) ( clanking ) ( gasping ) ( gasping ) ( groaning ) ( moaning ) 3 MURDERS IN 3 WEEKS. NOT GOOD FOR OUR TOWN'S IMAGE. NOT GOOD FOR MY IMAGE. THEN, AT 10:45 THIS MORNING, THE CHIEF OF POLICE TELLS ME HE WAS FORCED TO RELEASE YOUR PRIME SUSPECT. ( Sparky ) IT'S NOT UNUSUAL FOR POLICE TO FOCUS IN ON THE WRONG SUSPECT AT FIRST. ONE OF THE CARDINAL RULES OF POLITICS IS NEVER LET A FAILING SUBORDINATE UNDERMINE YOUR OFFICE. I'M CALLING IN THE F.B.I., SPARKY. I'M THIS CLOSE. GIVE ME 2 WEEKS, THAT'S IT. YOU'VE GOT ONE WEEK. 7 DAYS, 168 HOURS. ONE MORE KID IS SLAUGHTERED, YOU'RE GOING TO WISH YOU NEVER WALKED IN THAT DOOR. RIGHT. Car 111. HANG ON. THIS IS CAR 111. DETECTIVE JEFF SPEAKING. Where the hell's Sparky ? SPARKY'S CODE 6. HE'S AT THE HIGH SCHOOL. Well, find him and get your asses over to Hazelton Police Department, now. They arrested a guy on a simple assault charge and he wound up confessing to all 3 murders. HOLY SHIT. SLICED AND DICED THE FIRST BOY WITH A SWORD-KNIFE. HE HAD A CUTE GIRLFRIEND, BUT SHE REMINDED ME OF MY COUSIN, SO I LEFT HER ALONE. I SMASHED THE 2ND ONE'S FACE IN WITH A BOWLING BALL, AND I STRUNG THE BITCH UP. WHY DID YOU KILL THEM, EUGENE ? WOULDN'T YOU LIKE TO KNOW. NOW, THE PERSON KILLING ALL THESE PEOPLE IS REAL STRONG, EUGENE. ARE YOU STRONG ? ( growling softly ) ( grunting ) ( Sparky ) GRAB HIM ! THAT THE GUY ? THAT'S HIM. THAT'S THE BASTARD. GOT HIM. ANYTHING ? NO, NOTHING YET. KEEP LOOKING. I KNOW THAT DAMN BOWLING BALL IS DOWN THERE. CHECK THE CAVES. ( people chattering ) I FORGOT TO TELL YOU ABOUT THIS DREAM I HAD THE OTHER NIGHT. IT WAS SO WEIRD. HEY, ARE YOU LISTENING TO ME ? HUH ? BRETT ? YEAH. THIS DREAM I HAD THE OTHER NIGHT. I HAVE TO TELL YOU ABOUT IT. IT WAS REALLY INTENSE. BRETT, WHERE ARE YOU ? I'M SORRY. I'M HERE. ALL RIGHT. ARE YOU ALL RIGHT ? OK. I'LL TELL YOU ABOUT IT LATER. OK. SORRY. ALL RIGHT, I'LL SEE YOU. OK. I GOTTA TELL HER. YOU DO. I JUST DON'T KNOW HOW. WITH ROMANCE, OK ? ROMANCE IS THE KEY TO EVERY WOMAN'S HEART. I KNOW THIS FIRSTHAND, ALL RIGHT ? THIS IS WHAT YOU DO. YOU GO UP TO MY PARENTS' SUMMER HOME. RIGHT ? HUH ? YEAH. GET OUT THE CANDLES. BREAK OUT THE WINE. HUH ? YEAH. THEN YOU TELL HER. LET HER DOWN EASY. OK, THAT'S GOOD. IT IS. I'M TELLING YOU. IT WORKS. IT'S GOING TO WORK. OK. WHOA ! DON'T WANT TO PEE ON MYSELF. YOU'RE WELCOME. CALL ME LATER. OK. ( toilet flushing ) ( sighing ) HEY, I DIDN'T KNOW YOUR PARENTS HAD A VACATION HOUSE, HOWIE. YEAH. ( Cody ) NO WAY I'M LETTING BUMPERS GO UP THERE WITH MY GIRL. I'M GOING TO KICK HIS FUCKING ASS. CAN I COUNT ON YOU ? HELL, YEAH. I NEED YOU TO BACK ME UP. I NEED 2 GUYS. I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT. DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT, MAN. LET'S KNOCK 'EM DEAD. ( people chattering ) YOU FIT HIS FINGER TO THE BALL, RIGHT ? THERE ARE 3 HOLES IN THE BALL. YOU FIT HIS FINGERS TO THE BALL, RIGHT ? WE SHOWED HIM THE BALL. HE POSITIVELY IDENTIFIED IT. POSITIVELY ? ( phone ringing ) HEY, YOU ! THIS YOUR BALL ? YEAH, IT'S MY BALL. PUT YOUR FINGERS IN THE HOLES. YEAH, SURE. HEY ! HEY, THAT'S NOT MY FUCKING BALL. FIRST-CLASS POLICE WORK, SPARKY. HEY ! ( grunting ) GODDAMN ! ( crickets chirping ) THIS IS SO AWESOME. REMIND ME TO THANK HOWIE. YEAH. THIS IS GONNA SOUND REALLY WEIRD. UM... BUT JUST-- JUST HEAR ME OUT. I'M LISTENING. 3 WEEKS AGO, UH, I RECEIVED, UH, A VERY STRANGE PACKAGE IN THE MAIL. UH, UH, IT'S A BULL... UH... A PRESERVED ANIMAL PART. ANYWAY, UH, THE POINT IS... IS THAT THERE WAS A NOTE ATTACHED TO IT, THAT GRANTED ME 3 WISHES. I KNOW, IT'S STUPID. I THREW IT IN THE TRASH. I THOUGHT IT WAS A JOKE, OF COURSE, BUT, UH... SOMEHOW I MANAGED TO MAKE A LITTLE WISH. I WISHED THAT YOU WOULD GO TO SPRING BLAST WITH ME. ( laughing ) THAT'S SO CUTE. NOT REALLY. ( sighing ) UH... REMEMBER... I ASKED YOU WHY YOU WANTED TO GO WITH ME ? AND YOU COULDN'T GIVE ME A GOOD ANSWER. YOU COULDN'T GIVE ME A GOOD ANSWER BECAUSE YOU HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. IT WAS NOT YOUR CHOICE. IT--IT-- I WISHED FOR IT. AND WHEN THE DANCE WAS OVER, SO WAS THE POWER OF THE WISH. REMEMBER WHAT YOU SAID ? "I DON'T WANT TO HURT YOUR FEELINGS. "I THINK WE SHOULD GO BACK TO OUR NORMAL RELATIONSHIP." AND THEN, WHEN YOU WENT BACK TO CODY, I JUST... I JUST-- I FELT SO BAD. AND SO I USED MY 2ND WISH... TO MAKE ME YOUR GIRLFRIEND. YEAH, BUT HERE'S THE THING, I LIKED YOU. I LIKED YOU BEFORE THAT THING. BUT NOW THAT I REALLY KNOW YOU... I JUST... I LOVE YOU. I KNOW I--I TOOK ADVANTAGE OF YOU AND IT WAS TERRIBLE. IT WAS SO WRONG. AND I TRIED TO TELL YOU, BUT, SAM, I DIDN'T WANT TO RISK LOSING YOU. SAM. SAM. ( door closing ) ( door locking ) ( sighing ) SAM. COME ON, I KNOW I WAS WRONG. WILL YOU OPEN THE DOOR, SAM ? JUST LET ME TALK TO YOU FOR ONE MINUTE. PLEASE, JUST LET ME--LET ME FINISH. ALL RIGHT, YOU TWO STAY OUT HERE. SEE IF HE COMES OUT FRONT. I'M GOING AROUND BACK. HEY, I'M GOING TO LOOK AROUND THE WINDOWS, MAN. ( exhaling ) I'M COOL. ( phone ringing ) ( ringing ) ( man ) You've reached the Buckley residence. Please leave a message. ( Howie ) She's probably taking off her clothes right now. Anyways, um, the killer that they caught, it's not him. I just wanted to call and tell you, because, uh, I'm a little freaked out. Good night. HOWIE, HOWIE. ( dial tone sounding ) OH, GREAT. WHAT THE FUCK ? OH, COME ON. BRETT. THIS ISN'T FUNNY. BRETT. ARE YOU OUT THERE ? ( breathing heavily ) WHERE ARE YOU GUYS ? TONY. TONY. QUIT PLAYING, MAN. WHERE THE FUCK ARE YOU ? TONY. ( screaming ) SHIT ! FUCK ! CODY, OPEN THE DOOR, MAN. LET ME IN. CODY, OPEN THE FUCKING DOOR, MAN. CODY, CODY ! OPEN THE FUCKING DOOR. ( banging ) WHAT THE... COME ON. COME ON. WHAT THE FUCK ? ( screaming ) OH, SH-- ( screaming ) ( screaming ) ( whimpering ) ( screaming ) ( footsteps approaching ) ( grunting ) YOU LIKE TAKING OTHER PEOPLE'S WOMEN, BUMPERS ? YOU THINK I WAS GONNA LET YOU GET AWAY WITH THAT ? YOU HAD TO TOUCH HER, DIDN'T YOU ? ( grunting ) GET UP, MOTHERFUCKER. GET UP. OH ! ( groaning ) OH... GOD ! ( breathing heavily ) SAM ? HEY, SAM. SAM. FUCKER ! BRETT. WHAT ARE YOU DOING UP THERE ? I WAS JUST LOOKING AROUND AND I SAW THAT THING, SO I WENT UP THERE-- CODY'S HERE AND HE'S TRYING TO KICK MY ASS AND HE'S DOING A PRETTY GOOD JOB OF IT. LET'S GET OUT OF HERE, THEN. COME ON, BRETT. LET'S GO. ( Cody screaming ) ( footsteps approaching ) GO. GO. SEE IF YOU CAN FIND SOMETHING TO TIE THIS UP. ( screaming ) ( both screaming ) ( man with distorted voice ) You've gotta talk to me, Brett. If you make me keep this up, somebody's gonna get hurt. It's your choice. I BETTER GO DOWN. WHAT ? NO. HERE, TAKE THIS. STAY UP HERE AND DON'T COME DOWN, NO MATTER WHAT. TIE IT UP WHEN I'M GONE. BRETT, BRETT, BRETT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT. I was the one who sent you the totem. It's my gift to you... because... you really are my best student. This is a... ( normal voice ) is a novelty item. LAST CHRISTMAS I TOOK A TRIP TO NEPAL, AND I BOUGHT THE TOTEM FOR... $100. IMAGINE THAT. 3 WISHES FOR $100. I KNEW I'D FOUND A MIRACLE WHEN THE MISSUS WAS KILLED IN A SINGLE CAR ACCIDENT LAST YEAR. THAT ACCIDENT... THAT WAS MY TEST-WISH. IT WAS QUITE SUCCESSFUL. I SUPPOSE I COULD HAVE DIVORCED HER, BUT... BUT KILLING HER SEEMED, UM... SO MUCH CLEANER. THEN I DID WHAT ANY NORMAL PERSON WOULD DO. I WISHED FOR MONEY, FUCK-YOU MONEY. AND I NOW HAVE $100 MILLION IN A SWISS ACCOUNT. WELL, MR.-- MR. TURNER... WHY DO YOU STILL TEACH HERE ? I MEAN, YOU COULD... TAKE OFF, GO--GO LIVE SOMEWHERE ELSE, AND--AND... LIVE LIKE A KING. DO YOU KNOW HOW LONG I'VE BEEN A TEACHER ? 25 YEARS. OH. AT FIRST, I THOUGHT I WOULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE. I THOUGHT, YOU KNOW, THAT EVERYBODY WOULD RESPECT WHAT I DID. BUT I WAS DELUDED. ALMOST EVERY PARENT-CHILD CONFERENCE BEGINS WITH THEM NODDING AND SMILING, BUT YOU DARE TO POINT OUT THAT THEIR PRECIOUS LITTLE SHITS ARE MISBEHAVING, AND THEY OPEN UP ON YOU. "NO, NO, NO, YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT OUR KID. "MAYBE IT'S YOUR FAULT. MAYBE YOU SHOULD LEARN TO TEACH BETTER." NO, MR. TURNER, YOU--YOU WERE THE BEST TEACHER, THE BEST TEACHER I EVER HAD. I--I LEARNED SO MUCH FROM YOU. SO, ANYWAY, AS MOST TEACHERS DO... I TOOK THE PATH OF LEAST RESISTANCE. BUT THE INDIGNITIES JUST BEGAN TO TAKE THEIR TOLL AND GOD, ONE DAY, FINALLY SMILED UPON ME. HE PRESENTED ME WITH A MEANS TO EXTRACT A MEASURE OF JUSTICE. JUSTICE ? I'M SORRY. I'VE GONE AND MADE A LONG SPEECH. SO, I USED MY--MY FINAL WISH FOR GREATER PHYSICAL STRENGTH. THINNING OUT THE HERD IS TAXING WORK. AND SOME OF THE BOYS I INTENDED TO KILL WERE VERY LARGE AND MUSCULAR. BUT, ANYWAY, PART OF THE LORE OF THE TOTEM IS THAT IF FREELY GIVEN, ANYONE CAN USE ITS MAGIC. AND I THOUGHT, BEFORE I DISAPPEARED, I WOULD BESTOW ITS POWER ON YOU, MY FAVORITE STUDENT. BUT, YOU USED YOUR WISHES TO PURSUE SOME BIMBO. YOU DISAPPOINTED ME, BRETT. WELL, SHE'S-- SHE'S NOT A BIMBO. OH. SHE'S VERY SMART. SHE'S A VERY SMART GIRL. I JUST-- I THINK IF YOU-- IF YOU GOT TO KNOW HER, IF YOU GAVE HER A CHANCE-- SHE'S ON MY LIST, BRETT. SHE'S THE LAST ONE, ACTUALLY. MR. TURNER, I'M ASKING YOU AS A FRIEND. AS A FRIEND, MR. TURNER. PLEASE. I'M DOING THIS FOR YOUR GOOD. SHE'S NO GOOD FOR YOU, BRETT. YOU DESERVE BETTER. YOU JUST DON'T KNOW IT YET. ( grunting ) BRETT. ( footsteps approaching ) ( Samantha grunting ) ( panting ) ( screaming ) SAMANTHA. ( screaming ) THIS IS A LITTLE GAME INVENTED BY THE VIKINGS. THE OBJECT WAS NOT TO KILL OR MUTILATE THE WOMAN, BUT TO SEE WHO COULD STRIKE THE CLOSEST TO HER. UNFORTUNATELY, THEY OFTEN PLAYED IT AT FEASTS, AND WERE FALLING-DOWN DRUNK. ( whimpering ) ( groaning ) I DECIDED MY LAST KILLING... SHOULD BE MEMORABLE. SO, GOODBYE, SAMANTHA WARREN. NEXT TIME... LISTEN IN CLASS. ( gasping ) OH. I STILL HAD A 3RD WISH. AND I WISHED TO BE TOUGHER, STRONGER AND FASTER THAN YOU. THAT'S WHAT YOU WISHED FOR ? YEAH. WELL, HE THREW ME OVER A COUCH. I WAS... SORRY. ( car starting ) ( groaning ) TOUGHER, STRONGER, FASTER, BUT NOT SMARTER ! YOU WOULDN'T KNOW IT NOW, BUT I WAS QUITE THE SOCCER PLAYER IN MY YOUTH. ( grunting ) OK. WHAT'S IT FEEL LIKE TO DIE, BRETT ? WHAT DO YOU SEE ? DO YOU SEE THE LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL ? BRETT, YOU'RE LEAVING ME. YOU'RE LEAVING ME. ( grunting ) BYE-BYE, BRETT. BYE-BYE, BRETT. ( screaming ) ( laughing ) ( grunting ) HA. HA. HA. HA. ( grunting ) FUN'S OVER, BRETT. ( grunting ) ( screaming ) YOU DON'T KILL YOUR WIFE, MR. TURNER. AND YOU DON'T KILL YOUR STUDENTS BECAUSE THEY DON'T LISTEN TO YOU IN CLASS. AND YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TRIED TO KILL SAMANTHA. ( grunting ) ( grunting ) ( gasping ) ( gasping ) ( gasping ) ( man ) ANY OTHER QUESTIONS ? ( people chattering ) ( woman ) WHO'S YOUR SUSPECT ? ( man ) DID YOU NOT NOTICE THIS BEFORE ? WHY WASN'T HIS BACKGROUND LOOKED INTO ? ANY OTHER MISTAKES, OFFICER ? CAN YOU GIVE US SOME COMMENT ? AFTER EXTENSIVE FORENSIC ANALYSIS... I WAS GOING TO USE MY FINAL WISH TO RELEASE YOU. I JUST HAD TO USE IT TO SAVE US. SO, I GUESS I'LL BE REALLY STRONG FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE. AND YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE ME FOR THE REST OF YOURS. UNLESS... UNLESS YOU GIVE ME THE TOTEM. IT'S NOT OFTEN THAT A SMALL TOWN LIKE OURS... HAS A GENUINE HERO IN ITS MIDST. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN... MR. BRETT BUMPERS. ( crowd cheering ) HI. THIS IS A LITTLE OVERWHELMING. HE'S MY FRIEND. HE'S MY BEST FRIEND. ( Brett ) WHAT HAPPENED WAS A TERRIBLE TRAGEDY. I WAS JUST LUCKY TO BE IN THE RIGHT PLACE AT THE RIGHT TIME. SORT OF NO CHOICE BUT TO DO THE RIGHT THING. ANYWAY, THANKS FOR EVERYTHING. FOR THIS WONDERFUL HONOR. ( all cheering ) HI. I ALWAYS WONDERED WHAT IT WAS LIKE OVER HERE. IT'S NICE. I CAN SEE EVERYTHING. YEAH. DID YOU MAKE A WISH ? UH-HUH. WHAT DID YOU WISH FOR ? ( man ) BRETT. UM. I SHOULD GO. BRETT. I GUESS EVERYTHING'S BACK TO NORMAL. YEAH. JUST AS IT SHOULD BE. EVERYONE MAKING THEIR OWN CHOICES. RIGHT. UH... WELL, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO NOW ? I DECIDED TO TAKE THE YEAR OFF. REALLY ? YEAH, I'M TAKING YOUR ADVICE. I'M GONNA TRAVEL. I LEAVE ON SUNDAY. I'M GOING TO START IN GREECE, AND FROM THERE, WHO KNOWS ? WOW, THAT'S... THAT'S GREAT. THAT'S--THAT'S REALLY GREAT, SAM. YOU DESERVE IT. THANKS, BRETT. SEE YOU AROUND SOMETIME. YEAH. HEY. HEY. SON, YOUR MOM AND I NEED TO TALK TO YOU. LET'S GO. NOW, YOU AGREED TO WORK IN THE SHOWROOM THIS SUMMER. I REMEMBER, DAD. WELL, YOUR MOM AND I HAVE BEEN THINKING THAT MAYBE YOU COULD USE A LITTLE REST TIME FROM ALL THIS HERO STUFF, SO... UH-HUH. IT CAME TO US LAST NIGHT, LIKE DIVINE INSPIRATION. HOPE YOU LIKE IT. IT'S AN OPEN TICKET FOR WORLD TRAVEL. YOU GO TO GREECE ON SUNDAY, AND AFTER THAT, IT'S UP TO YOU. I LOVE YOU GUYS. ? ALL MY LIFE ? I'VE BEEN WAITING ? FOR SOMEONE LIKE YOU ? THAT I COULD BELIEVE IN ? ALL THAT I'M WANTING ? ALL THAT I'LL SAY ? JUST TAKE WHAT CONFINES US ? WE'LL THROW IT AWAY AND ? SAY IT ? NO NEED TO HOLD ? HOLD YOUR TONGUE ? SAY IT ? IT'S JUST A QUESTION OF ? HOW WE'VE COME TO THIS PLACE ? ? OF CHANGE ? WE'RE TURNING THE PAGE ? WE'RE COMING OF AGE ? TODAY IS THE DAY ? WHERE CHOICES ARE MADE ? A COMING OF AGE ? I KNOW NOW ? JUST WHAT'S WORTH FIGHTING FOR ? ? IS TO STAND ON OUR OWN ? AND FINDING HER PLACE IN THIS WORLD ? ? WHERE THERE'S NO FALLING IN LINE ? ? NO SENSE OF REGIMENT ? NO COLORING WORDS ? TO HIDE WHAT THEY REALLY MEANT ? ? SAY IT ? NO NEED TO HOLD ? HOLD YOUR TONGUE ? SAY IT ? IT'S JUST A QUESTION OF ? HOW WE'VE COME TO THIS PLACE ? ? OF CHANGE ? WE'RE TURNING THE PAGE ?
