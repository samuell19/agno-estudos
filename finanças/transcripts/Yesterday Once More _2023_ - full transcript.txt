Almost. ﻿Attack! Attack! You destroy the turret! ﻿What are you doing? ﻿Who just promised to do the dishes? ﻿A little idiot just said he would do the dishes. ﻿Who was it?

What's going on? ﻿Recently, I always feel that ﻿Yuxuan and I don't seem to be on the same page. ﻿These days, ﻿he keeps working all day, all night. ﻿If I ask how he is doing ﻿ and care about him, ﻿it seems to give him great pressure. ﻿You are getting married next year, right? ﻿Or is he saving for the opening of the bakery? ﻿ That was how we planned. ﻿But his father died a while ago. ﻿After Yuxuan came back from the funeral, ﻿we are not working out. ﻿Master Gu works so hard ﻿just to give you a better life. ﻿I know he's trying hard for me. ﻿But I'm doing my best, too. ﻿Why must he carry everything on his own? ﻿Mr Bai Cha, this is our designer. ﻿Hello. I,m sorry. ﻿I'm almost done with the preliminaries. ﻿You can get down to business. ﻿Hello, Mr. Bai Cha. ﻿If you had come any later, ﻿I would have to talk with him ﻿about where our Goldfish toy ﻿rents an apartment. I owe you one. ﻿Whatever you want to eat, it's on me. ﻿Forget it. Next time. ﻿After New Year’s Day, ﻿Olivia and I are coming to the end of our cooling-off period. ﻿Are you really divorcing? ﻿Yes. ﻿ That's not what you said ﻿the last time you got drunk. ﻿I still have the proof here. Wanna see that? ﻿I’m divorcing for dignity. ﻿Who is this woman? ﻿You know you're cheating? ﻿How is that called cheating? ﻿Your name is Teddy, ﻿so you act like a dog out there? ﻿What do you mean? ﻿That's too harsh. ﻿Is it too harsh for you? ﻿You shouldn't have done that. ﻿What have I done? ﻿I just had dinner with my friend. ﻿Her high heel fell off. ﻿So I helped her for a while. ﻿Her high heel? ﻿Fell off again? ﻿And this one? ﻿And this one, it fell off every time? ﻿How did I get that trending topic? ﻿ You are in the trending topics? ﻿Then you should thank me. ﻿Hell yeah! ﻿ Hey! ﻿Thank you! ﻿So, did Teddy ﻿ really cheat? ﻿Of course noL ﻿Even if he wants to, he doesn’t dare to. ﻿He’s just a social butterfly ﻿And it was his birthday back then. ﻿He was just putting on a show ﻿Then you don't have to divorce, right? ﻿I don't have to? ﻿Do you know what she has done? ﻿After I left. ﻿she found she was still streaming. ﻿Then, in front of so many viewers, ﻿she played the victim and ﻿fanned the flame, ﻿implying that I'm a scum. ﻿Her fans went crazy, you know? ﻿They cursed the shit out of me. ﻿Who's calling? Why didn't you answer? ﻿Who cares? I don't have to. ﻿ Are you in trouble or something? ﻿A lot of men came for you last time. ﻿No. Didn't I tell you? ﻿Those guys just got the wrong person. ﻿ Okay. You don’t wanna tell me, ﻿so I'm not gonna force you. ﻿ But if you have any... ﻿Don’t worry. I'm totally fine. ﻿Oh! Oh crap! ﻿Recently, we call for works of picture books externally. ﻿This is one of the works submitted. ﻿Let me know if it's good. ﻿This story ﻿ is about a robot boy ﻿ who got the power to make wishes. ﻿who got the power to make wishes. ﻿But he can never get what he wants, ﻿ in his own heart. ﻿And one day ﻿for having what he wants, ﻿he gives all he has ﻿but is only able to restart his story. ﻿What’s new about that? ﻿Here is my point. ﻿Don't you think his style looks like yours? ﻿ Kind of. ﻿So I personally think ﻿we can contact this person ﻿ to see if you could work out a collaboration. ﻿Your aesthetic ideas may match well. ﻿I've just sent him an e-mail. ﻿I'm free now. Just come. ﻿ You got a slot. ﻿ How rude he is! ﻿Let me see. ﻿I'll meet him and have a talk. ﻿Why? Are you competing? ﻿Hello. ﻿I'm here for the author of Yesterday Once More. ﻿Come on, come on, sit down. ﻿hi, everyone! ﻿She is han Shuyan. ﻿Look at the five cakes. ﻿They are all Shuyan's works.

Thank you. boss! ﻿Mr. Wang, I want to take a leave. ﻿ Today is my birthday. ﻿I know. ﻿Whenever we have a party, ﻿you'll find an excuse to skip out. ﻿And you'll be the first one to work overtime. ﻿You are one of the persons in charge of this project. ﻿And today is your birthday. ﻿You can’t skip out. ﻿ Just because today's my birthday, ﻿my girlfriend wants to celebrate with me. ﻿Look, you stick with your girlfriend every day. ﻿You got plenty of time to spare, right? ﻿Hi, Mom. ﻿A cake baker? What's going on? ﻿I saw the live stream. ﻿Happy New Year, Mr. Wang! ﻿Happy New Year! ﻿Today, I met the author of ﻿Yesterday Once More. ﻿ It turned out to be an old man. ﻿He even said a bunch of ﻿ weird words that ﻿I don't understand. ﻿But I think we can talk about it. ﻿Yes, we can. ﻿But love and marriage aren't the same things. ﻿Drink less. ﻿Excuse me. ﻿Hey, Yuxuan. ﻿Can you come home earlier today? I'm waiting. ﻿ I'll be right back. ﻿Hello, Shuyan. ﻿We are now at the Star Hotel. ﻿Yuxuan is not going back tonight. ﻿Hey! ﻿Come and celebrate the New Year with us. ﻿I’ll call you a car. ﻿ Are you crazy? ﻿Hello? Hello? ﻿Dude, it’s New Year's Eve! ﻿We should eat and drink together ﻿and make some noise! ﻿I told her not to come. ﻿It’s dangerous alone at night. ﻿You're not her dad. ﻿Why do you care so much? ﻿Hello? ﻿ Hey, this is from the collection agency. ﻿Your boyfriend has owed us a lot of money. ﻿Party time! ﻿Lets’ get drunk! ﻿Yuxuan. ﻿ Mr. Wang. ﻿I heard your girlfriend is coming. ﻿Yes Teddy urged her to come. ﻿I'm telling you, ﻿you took design orders privately, ﻿but I've kept it down for you. ﻿Yet, you asked for a six-month advance on your salary. ﻿I discussed it with the accountant this afternoon. ﻿We have no precedent for that. ﻿ I really can't help it. ﻿Mr. Wang, I... ﻿What is it? ﻿Are you borrowing money from the company? ﻿Yes? Who's calling? Excuse me. ﻿ I’ll leave you guys alone. ﻿Is it true what Wang has said? ﻿Come in. Let's talk inside. ﻿You need a six-month advance on your salary? ﻿What do you need so much money for? ﻿Didn't we agree on the funds for the bakery? ﻿ We're saving for it together. ﻿You don't need so much money. ﻿Don't listen to Wang. ﻿He is so full of shit. ﻿ Stop lying to me. ﻿I got a call from the debt collector. ﻿Yuxuan, did something bad happen? ﻿Don’t worry. ﻿I can sort it out alone ﻿You can sort it out? ﻿Yuxuan. It doesn’t seem like a small thing. ﻿ Let's go home. ﻿We'll talk at home. ﻿Why are you always like this? ﻿You always tell me nothing when things happen. ﻿Do we have to make it clear right here? ﻿Because it's not the way you were. ﻿What was I like? ﻿I found the distance between us ﻿longer and longer. ﻿Yuxuan, what on earth happened? ﻿Do you know ﻿ you make me so insecure now? ﻿ You didn't tell your mom about you making cakes. ﻿Where the heck is your standard? ﻿They are two different things, aren't they? ﻿Come. Come here. ﻿Come here. ﻿If you have to know now, ﻿I will tell you. ﻿Before my father died, ﻿he was in a lot of debt. ﻿Now they force me to pay back the debt. ﻿I don't have a clue when ﻿ I will be able to pay it off. ﻿Am I clear? ﻿So why didn't you tell me earlier? ﻿Can't we face it together? ﻿By paying it back with our funds for the bakery? ﻿Yeah! Why not? ﻿Just pay it back with our funds! ﻿If I spend all your hard earned money, ﻿how do we live in the future? ﻿Why do you have so little faith in us? ﻿I just have no faith in myself. ﻿Now I can’t afford a property we want to live in. ﻿I can’t give you your ideal wedding. ﻿Nor can I give you a good life. ﻿I can't even take care of myself, ﻿let alone you. ﻿Sometimes I think ﻿I don’t want you to be with such a loser like me. ﻿Are you gonna break up with me? ﻿Why are you so selfish? ﻿ Have you ever asked what I really want? ﻿I don’t love you for what you said. ﻿I love who you are. ﻿But I never thought ﻿you would leave me so easily. ﻿Shuyan. ﻿Shuyan! ﻿ Shuyan. ﻿Shuyan. ﻿Let me explain, Shuyan. ﻿Shuyan. ﻿Shuyan! ﻿Shuyan! ﻿I don't love you for what you said. ﻿I love who you are. ﻿Mrs. Han. ﻿Shuyan is gone. ﻿I'm sorry. ﻿So, today's your birthday. ﻿How are you gonna spend it? ﻿Today is your birthday. ﻿I hope all dreams and wishes will come true. ﻿We took a lot of photos together, for the first time. ﻿Do you like them? ﻿Officially the first day we're together. I'm a bit shy. ﻿Let's do our best. ﻿I always love you, make your wish ﻿Today's my birthday. ﻿ I want to make myself a cake. ﻿Let me celebrate with you, okay? ﻿You didn't tell your mom about you making cakes. ﻿Where the heck is your standard? ﻿ But I never thought ﻿you would leave me so easily. ﻿Yuxuan, are you awake? ﻿What is it, so early in the morning? ﻿I dreamt of you having an accident last night. ﻿I was freaked out. ﻿So good you’re here. ﻿I’m always here. ﻿You're just too tired. ﻿Let's celebrate your birthday this evening. ﻿Sure. ﻿Coming! Right away! ﻿Sorry, Yuxuan. ﻿It’s all right. ﻿Fine. Let me hold this. ﻿Okay. ﻿Are you okay? ﻿Aren't you in a hurry?

Oh crap! ﻿I deserve it. ﻿Maybe, what will happen ﻿is destined earlier. ﻿it's inevitable. ﻿Recently, we call for ﻿works of picture books externally. ﻿This is... ﻿one of the works we have received. ﻿I'm sorry. ﻿ Although I submitted this, ﻿I still wish to ﻿work with someone who can truly comprehend this story. ﻿Do you want to say ﻿the style of this picture book is similar to mine? ﻿Do you know something? Tell me. ﻿ Will Shuyan die for real? ﻿ Do you think you have much time to love her? ﻿Shuyan. ﻿Aren't you at work? Why are you here? ﻿Took the rest of the day off. ﻿Are you done? ﻿Yeah. I’m done. ﻿Let's go, then. ﻿Shuyan. ﻿You kept telling me about ﻿ a place you want to go to. ﻿Let's go there today. ﻿How do you know where I want to go? ﻿I'm the Prophet. ﻿Of course, I know. ﻿Is this it? ﻿Yeah. This is it. ﻿I saw it was for rent online. ﻿But we didn’t tell the landlord today. ﻿I guess we can just have a look outside. ﻿It's all right. ﻿This has a courtyard. ﻿Yes. This is the courtyard. ﻿Though it's a little run down, ﻿we can still get some umbrellas here. ﻿Then it'll be an outdoor cafe. ﻿Good. ﻿ I also wanna plant a tree. ﻿If we have enough budget, ﻿how about planting it here? ﻿Will do. ﻿and here ﻿we can put up a blackboard ﻿to show costumes ﻿the limited cake of the day. ﻿Yeah...this is it. ﻿On the left over there, ﻿ we'll have a display freezer ﻿so that the customers can see ﻿the day's fresh cakes as they come in. ﻿Sure. ﻿Are you all right? ﻿Yeah. ﻿Things are way too old here. ﻿If we really rent this place, ﻿ it needs proper renovations. ﻿What you can do now ﻿is to make the most of the time you have left. ﻿I don't believe it. I don't believe it. ﻿There must be a way to save her! Definitely! ﻿Yuxuan. ﻿Yuxuan? ﻿Yuxuan! ﻿How do you want to spend your birthday? ﻿Shall we celebrate it at home this evening? ﻿Okay. ﻿ Look.

Here is Master Gu again. ﻿ No need to worry about me. ﻿Go out on a date. ﻿Anyway, as a divorcee-to-be, ﻿ I don't want to see you guys around ﻿ showing off your love. ﻿I can't stand it. ﻿ Wait. ﻿ I'll show you something. ﻿After you see it, then consider ﻿ whether you’re divorcing Teddy. ﻿Listen,I'm excellent. ﻿I deserve to be loved by a better woman. ﻿There’s plenty of fish in the sea. ﻿Why must you... Why must you divorce me? ﻿We... We can talk. ﻿You know him. ﻿No, I can't admit defeat.... ﻿He always stands on pride and bears with it. ﻿In this world, I can't find ﻿any woman like you. ﻿so sexy, amusing, lovely ﻿and so special to me. ﻿He does love you very much. ﻿ I really can't leave you. ﻿Marry me. ﻿Marry me again. ﻿I know. ﻿But I can't text her ﻿because she blocked me. ﻿Are we really coming to my house? ﻿ But I'm not ready yet. ﻿We can't wait anymore, ﻿Otherwise... ﻿Shuyan, I’m here with you. ﻿Don't be afraid. ﻿Hello, Mom. ﻿ A cake baker? What's going on? ﻿I saw the live stream. ﻿Shuyan always wants to be honest with you. ﻿But she fears that you would be mad at her like you are now. ﻿She lied that she was an English teacher. ﻿But now she ia cake baker. ﻿How can I be happy? ﻿Yes. I lied to you, ﻿ just because you expect me to be an English teacher. ﻿What's so bad about that? ﻿ Isn’t it a steadier job? ﻿ ﻿Mrs. Han. please hear Shuyan out ﻿to see what on earth she wants to be. ﻿This is her dream. ﻿Mom, you haven't eaten the cake I make. How do you know it's not good? ﻿Over the years, as a cake baker, ﻿I have gained a lot of customers. ﻿Seeing them eat my cakes ﻿ and feel happy, ﻿also feel happy in my heart. ﻿It's a career that I've been following through with love. ﻿So I’m looking forward to your support. Mrs. Han Shuyan told me ﻿ you love strawberries. ﻿ So today she particularly made ﻿this strawberry cake for you. ﻿Just have a taste. ﻿Mom try it. ﻿Mom, just try it. ﻿I made this cake. ﻿Take a bite. Take a bite. ﻿Is it good? ﻿If you say nothing, it's good. ﻿ If you hadn’t been there, ﻿I really don't know how I should talk to my mother. ﻿Really? ﻿So, if you take the leap bravely, ﻿you'll find things are not that difficult. Right? ﻿Why do you take me here suddenly? ﻿I’ve sold this house. ﻿The new owner wants to tear it down ﻿to build a new house. ﻿The construction will start soon. ﻿Before it's torn down, ﻿I’d like to bring you back to see it. ﻿Why did you sell it? ﻿Isn't it a good idea to keep it as a souvenir? ﻿Before my father died, ﻿he invested with someone ﻿and got cheated. ﻿ he was in a lot of debt. ﻿That’s why I sold this house ﻿to pay back. ﻿How did he get cheated? ﻿Didn't he ask you before making decisions? ﻿Before he died, ﻿we hadn’t talked for a long time. ﻿Shuyan. ﻿Do you remember the box ﻿of birthday candles back then? ﻿Yes,I do. ﻿ You still keep it. ﻿The candles are made for my birthday ﻿by my mom ﻿for the last time before she died. ﻿She was already very sick then. ﻿ But, to make me happy... What's your wish? ﻿ she didn't tell me about it. ﻿ I hope the cake today is delicious. ﻿Of course. ﻿Mom has prepared it just for you. ﻿And then she left us. ﻿My dad had a hard time. ﻿ He started to hit the bottle. ﻿He beat me up whenever he got drunk. ﻿One is of age at 18. ﻿I guess I was of age at 7. ﻿Every time he sobered up, ﻿he would apologize to me sadly and ﻿ promise he wouldn't do it again. ﻿But he didn't keep it once. So you said no one else ﻿but me had celebrated your birthday. ﻿From now on, we will celebrate your ﻿every birthday together. ﻿Shuyan. ﻿These days I’ve been having the same dream. ﻿In this dream, ﻿every time I lit a candle, ﻿ I would go through the same day all over again. ﻿Including the first time, ﻿I have been through today three times. ﻿Sounds like the plot of a novel. ﻿Yuxuan, what’s this place? ﻿you'll see soon. ﻿Wait here for a while. ﻿Okay. ﻿ I'll be right back. ﻿Lend me your boyfriend. ﻿what? ﻿Just for a while. ﻿I'll give him back. Happy New Year! ﻿Shuyan. ﻿Why are you...? ﻿Hey, I'll take you to a good place for fun. ﻿But Yuxuan told me to wait for him here. ﻿I’ll tell him when he comes back. ﻿Let's go now. ﻿Wait. But he... ﻿Wait for what? Just go! ﻿ Where are we going? ﻿Don't be curious. ﻿Just follow me. ﻿Olivia. ﻿Olivia. ﻿Olivia! ﻿Well, it’s...? ﻿It’s what I asked Teddy and Olivia ﻿to do for me. ﻿Thank you. ﻿Shuyan. ﻿ I feel I’m especially lucky ﻿to be able to meet you again ﻿at Teddy and Olivia's wedding. ﻿You love art toys, ﻿so I become a designer. ﻿I'm a sweet tooth, ﻿so you become a baker. ﻿Thank you ﻿for always tolerating me. ﻿and teaching me how to love. ﻿Shuyan. ﻿I wish to love you with my life. ﻿ No matter when and ﻿no matter what happens in the future, ﻿I will be always right here with you ﻿and will never leave you. ﻿I love you. ﻿I...I'm sorry ﻿ for giving you a downhill marriage. ﻿ But I just hope you can see ﻿ that I really love you ﻿Now you're more sincere than at the wedding. ﻿It’s not there yet. ﻿ Sorry. ﻿Yuxuan ﻿Have you ever thought ﻿about what our wedding ﻿would be like? ﻿A simple one, I guess. ﻿jtj Right. I don't want ﻿an over-the-top wedding like ﻿Olivia and Teddy's. ﻿It's up to you. ﻿When we open our bakery one day, ﻿how about we change to a bigger house ﻿and keep a dog? ﻿ There can be a cat and a dog, ﻿so they can be companions. ﻿How about that? ﻿Okay. ﻿Yuxuan. ﻿Thank you ﻿for being so nice to me. ﻿I’m really happy today. ﻿ I just want you to know ﻿our love in this life ﻿is the best gift ever in my destiny. ﻿Same here. ﻿Let’s go. We'll go home and celebrate your birthday. ﻿Shuyan! ﻿Shuyan. ﻿Are you okay? ﻿Shuyan. ﻿Shuyan, wake up. ﻿Mom is here. ﻿Mom. ﻿Go call the doctor. ﻿Okay... ﻿Where am I? ﻿You had a car accident last night. ﻿Don't you remember? ﻿Mom. Mom. ﻿Where’s Yuxuan? ﻿ Girl. Calm down. ﻿I'll tell you. ﻿Yuxuan... Yuxuan is a good boy. ﻿For saving you, ﻿ he stood in front of you. ﻿In the end.. ﻿Mom, what did you say? Mom? ﻿ Where's Yuxuan? ﻿Where's Yuxuan? ﻿Don't move. ﻿Where's Yuxuan? ﻿Babe. Stay still. Stay still. ﻿Mom. Where's he? ﻿Shuyan. ﻿You go home first. ﻿I want to be alone. ﻿Here's another thing I want you to understand. ﻿If I can’t be with Shuyan ﻿for a while, ﻿I hope you can spend time with her. ﻿She doesn’t eat spicy food now ﻿lest it could affect her taste in making cakes. ﻿When she's unhappy, ﻿she'll drink a cup of hot chocolate, ﻿with a few marshmallows in it. ﻿Did anything happen to you recently? ﻿No, I'm fine. ﻿Shuyan. ﻿Shuyan. ﻿I know you are so sad now. ﻿But you must pull yourself together. ﻿Otherwise, what’s the point of Yuxuan's death? ﻿So Yuxuan got caught in the reversal ﻿of time for making the wish? ﻿So the candles can really reverse time, ﻿right? ﻿I have no candle now. ﻿I don't know whether I can save Shuyan. But I still want to give it a try. ﻿How? ﻿Didn't that old man say it's impossible? ﻿Here's all my property information ﻿and bank cards. I have sold my old house. ﻿I don't know what will happen. ﻿When the time comes, ﻿please help me solve this one with the money. ﻿Why? ﻿I don’t understand. ﻿You can do it yourself. ﻿So... ﻿Yuxuan has been ready ﻿ for saving my life. ﻿Do you know where the picture book's ﻿author lives? ﻿ Sorry. I’m mistaken. ﻿No, you aren't. Come on in. ﻿Come in. ﻿Take a seat. ﻿I know what you're going to ask ﻿I have to tell you this. ﻿The end of the story is hard to be changed. ﻿Perhaps you could temporarily ﻿change the experience of others. ﻿But you still find it hard to change the end. ﻿In this dream, ﻿I kept trying to change a thing. ﻿But I didn't make it at last. ﻿What did you try to change? ﻿ I tried to change someone’s fate. ﻿I don’t believe it. ﻿ I have to save him. ﻿If Yuxuan died in my place, ﻿ then it means fate is changeable. ﻿There must be a way. ﻿You... ﻿Have you wondered what it would cost you? ﻿And the candles ﻿won’t start over with the reversal of time. ﻿What are you looking for? ﻿Nothing. ﻿The candles ﻿have run out. ﻿ I tried to change someone’s fate. ﻿In this dream. ﻿of the candles made by my mom and me, ﻿only two are left. ﻿ Every time I lit a candle, ﻿I would go through the same day all over again. ﻿Including the first time, ﻿I have been through today three times. ﻿ Once I was like you, ﻿I wanted to change everything. ﻿But I have run out of candles. ﻿Do you remember the box of birthday candles back then? ﻿Yes. You still keep it. ﻿The candles ﻿are made for my birthday ﻿by my mom for the last time before she died. ﻿No. ﻿ There's still one left. ﻿What are you doing? ﻿You can't get in there! ﻿It's my boyfriend's house. ﻿I need to get in to find something. ﻿ All is taken down in there! ﻿Keep out, miss! ﻿Hey, you... ﻿All is taken down! ﻿Miss. ﻿Miss. Are you okay? ﻿Miss. ﻿ Open the door, miss! - Yes. Please! Get Yuxuan back! ﻿No! Don't? ﻿Sit Please! ﻿Get Yuxuan back. ﻿ No! ﻿The end of the story is hard to change. ﻿If Yuxuan died in my place, ﻿then it means fate is changeable. ﻿There must be a way. Have you wondered what it would cost you? ﻿:Are you not coming ﻿back to me no matter what? ﻿If Yuxuan could ﻿ keep living in this world, ﻿I’d rather... ﻿I'd rather... ﻿We never... ﻿never met again. And we... ﻿ never loved. ﻿Yes? ﻿Hey, Shuyan. Where are you? ﻿The bakery has sent the cake here. ﻿What's taking you so long? ﻿ Did you forget it's my wedding day today? ﻿Aren't you married? ﻿What's the nonsense? ﻿Teddy and I are waiting for you. ﻿Come here soon. ﻿Which year is it now? ﻿Are you insane? ﻿ 2018. ﻿2018? ﻿Yuxuan. ﻿Hey man! ﻿ Teddy looks so smart today. ﻿So do you. You look good. ﻿The vibes are perfect! ﻿Teddy, where's Gu Yuxuan? ﻿Do you know each other? ﻿Where's he? ﻿His plane is late. ﻿K5ES7 I'm stumped. ﻿He's my best man. you know? ﻿When did you know him? ﻿No. ﻿I don't know him. ﻿Teddy, One more is needed here... ﻿What’s needed? ﻿Yuxuan and Teddy are having a meeting. ﻿What do you want with him? ﻿The bill, please. ﻿ Are you a member? ﻿-I am. -I am. ﻿Yeah. ﻿Later we gradually understand. ﻿ Perhaps this is the price I have to pay for the wish. ﻿ After the time is reversed, ﻿I can't see Yuxuan again. ﻿Sorry. ﻿the number you dialed is empty. ﻿Please check it and dial again. ﻿After I understand this, ﻿I start to worry. ﻿If I insist on meeting him, ﻿will there be another accident? ﻿So I begin to learn how to live on my own ﻿and get used to it. ﻿But sometimes I still want to know ﻿Whether ﻿he is fine ﻿without me. ﻿ Mom, I’m back. ﻿Tomorrow I must transfer money to you. -Hello. - Here's the deal. ﻿I'm here to promote the anti-fraud application. ﻿People often get calls soliciting investments ﻿and get cheated at last. ﻿We got many cases like that. ﻿I promise you. ﻿It's really a fraud. ﻿A fraud? ﻿How did I get that trending topic? ﻿Then you should thank me. ﻿Hell yeah! ﻿Wow. What a lovely doll! ﻿Come here, you guys. ﻿Hi, everyone. ﻿What do you think of the performance ﻿of Olivia and Teddy? ﻿When Yuxuan's dad died. ﻿it must be really tough for him. ﻿ I really want to make him better. ﻿But I can't. ﻿There’s only one thing I can do for him. ﻿Happy birthday! ﻿Happy New Year! ﻿CAKE SHOP ﻿LAKE SHOP ﻿Welcome! ﻿Hello. ﻿Do you still have the wish cake ﻿on the poster at the door? ﻿Yes. ﻿Just... wait a second. ﻿No problem. ﻿I can wait. ﻿Is it a duck? ﻿Nope. ﻿It’s a rabbit. ﻿It's snowing. They say when the first snow falls. ﻿A the one who loves you ﻿will show up. ﻿Here. ﻿Thank you.
