My friend, goodbye. You sure tried your best, but... you know, it just didn't work out. Maybe now... -How are you? -Guess what? It's in. -That's what I was hoping. Thanks. -I only got 1 case, settle for 1 bottle? Sure, for now. Yeah. -Look. Scratched. You mind? -No problem. Bring a bottle of that new Cabernet from the back for Mr. Nolan, will ya? This label's all scratched up. He's new. Started yesterday. I think he's gonna be okay. On the floor! Get the money now, motherfucker! Get on the fucking floor! -Give me the money! -OK, just stay cool. Come on, motherfucker! You better stay on that fucking ground, man! Relax. Stay cool. Here. Come on, man, give me the fucking money! -Fuck! -Wait, wait, wait! -You're okay? -Yeah. You? Yeah. Oh, my God! He shot the phone. I'm getting help. -What happened, man? -You're gonna be okay. -I'm fucking shot. I'm fucking shot. -You're gonna be okay. Help's coming. -Who was it? -Some kid. Give me the bottle. -A guy, right? -Yep, some guy. -He get you? -No. That's good stuff. Only one case back there. That's good stuff. -Is Tony okay? -Yeah. He went for help. -Lotta blood. -No, it's okay. -Feel that? I... -Lotta blood. Yeah, it's okay. They're coming. Who are you? What's your name, man? What's your name? -John. -Hey, John. John? -I think I'm fucking dying. -You're not. Don't say that. Hang on. -I think I'm fucking dying, John. -Freeze! -Don't shoot. Don't shoot! -Let him go! -A man's been shot. I'm helping him. -Let him go! -I'm helping. There's a man shot. -Let me see the hands! It's okay. I got him! He's okay. He's helping the other guy! -Are you injured, sir? -I'm not. He is. I need an ambulance. 740 Dobson Street. Man down. -Watch your hand. -Let's take Figueroa. It's quicker. Let's roll. -Sir, you can't come inside. -I gotta go too. I gotta ride along. -Let's go. Let's go. -Let's go. Move. Sir, what's his name? -What? -Your friend. What's his name? I don't know. He wants to say something. Auggie. The name... is Auggie Rose. It'll be okay, John. It'll be okay. This is unit 21. The patient's BP is now 80 over 60 and dropping. ETA is 12 minutes. Did the assailant have any other physical characteristics? -I told you, I was on the floor. -Will you be able to identify him? I don't know. I was on the floor. He wore black sneakers, like I told you. What about his voice? -What? -His voice. Mr. Nolan, did you hear his voice? -It was normal. -Mr. Nolan! Internal hemorrhage precipitated the massive amount of patient blood loss. Ballistics should be ready tomorrow. I think it's a 38. -Yes? -The patient? Auggie Rose. I'm sorry, sir. He didn't make it. There were fragments in the bone. It'll take time but we can get it out. Mr. Nolan! -You need to finish your statement. -Yeah. What do you want to know? We need to know your occupation. I'm an insurance salesman. I sell life insurance. John? John? John. What are you doing? The store clerk came out of the back. It startled the robber. He shot him. It's a clich?, but how easily could've been my blood on the floor... but it wasn't, it was this man's, Auggie. He was killed. I'm fine. My God. It's... it's unbelievable. -The wine bottle was scratched. -What? The label on the wine bottle. It was scratched. That's why he went into the back. He was getting me a new bottle. John, John. It was not your fault. Can you imagine the family? What they're going through? Why didn't you wake me up? Why didn't you call me? I don't know. You're gonna be alright? Yeah. I'm gonna be fine. I'm gonna be fine. What's the thing that people worry the most about? Worry. Money, isn't it? It sounds crass to say, but it's true. They do. What do you guys like to do for fun? What do you do for fun? -We like the movies. -Do you? Hook. And movie popcorn? How about that? I love that. But it costs. More than the tickets. Like groceries and clothes, and school for the kids. Do you have kids? -Yes, two. -Really? What are their names? Annie and Billy. I can tell you love them. Look at the look in their eyes. Jesus. You know, I'm jealous. I don't have kids, but one of these days... Anyway, everything you do in life, it all... Look, even coming here. Your car, and your gas, and your shampoo... everything in here. Our furniture, our lovely suits... ourselves. It all costs money. Not that I'm saying money buys happiness. But it does buy security. God forbid if something should happen to you, Mr. Lark. Who would provide for Mrs. Lark and Billy and Annie? That's what we like to do: provide for the future security. We don't want you to worry if you're not here. You're gonna live to be 100. I'm sure. You're healthy, we're all healthy. We're not gonna worry... but just in case. That's what I do. I provide second chances... for your loved ones. Just in case you can't. Sounds good to us. Where do we sign? John? Yeah. Oh, baby, baby. Look at this. Decisive. -The Larks? Good close. -You should've seen him. -He had them hooked? -Mesmerized. Carol called. She wanted to know how you were. You sick? How can he be sick? He's coming with me to the convention. -Carl. Jeez, could you go to that? -You're not comin'? I got, I got... work to do. Well, maybe tomorrow. It lasts all week. Yeah. We appreciate you coming down to cooperate. You've been very helpful. And if you think of anything else, just give us a call. Don't hesitate. You're not gonna catch this guy, are you? We have an accurate description of the suspect. Sometimes we do our job. I'd like to pay my respects. Do you know when the funeral is gonna be? That's up to his family. But no one's claimed the body yet. -You haven't told anybody yet? -It's only been 24 hours. -He's from out of town. It takes time. -You must know something about him. -Detective, telephone. -Just a second. -You know nothing about him? -No. Until we notify next of kin... policy dictates we reveal as little as possible. Policy? -And John wasn't hurt? -No, not a scratch. That's truly frightening. Did you hear about John? -Yeah, he was just telling me. -You're lucky. You came really close. No, me. I was never in that much danger. I was on the floor, but... -Auggie... -Who? -The store clerk. -The guy who makes sandwiches? I think I've seen him in there. Well, maybe, but he just started, it was his second day on the job. Anyway, he was getting me a bottle of wine. -A guy works in a place like that. -What? It's like a liquor store. Or driving a cab. It's a risk he must've known. Paul, he died. I was in the ambulance with him. I know, it's really tragic. No, it's a scratch. So what? I'll take this. John. You want eggs? I got time. John? I'm sorry, Carol. He's not in. Did you try him on his cell? Yeah, yeah. I can't reach him. Did he say where he went? -No, he just left. -That's not like him. -Is everything okay? -Didn't he tell you what happened? Tell me what? Hang on a second, will you? I told you. Detective Cole's not here. -You gave a statement, didn't you? -Yeah. -Are you a relative? -No. I'm a witness. I'll tell Detective Cole you were here. Excuse me. Yes? Yeah, I'm back. Hello. What? Mr. Nolan. -Hey. Decker. -Yes? When my partner and I entered the deli, we didn't know the assailant... had fled the scene. I saw you and the victim. I didn't know what was what. -I was aggressive. I'm sorry. -You were just doing your job. Listen. -They still haven't located next of kin. -Cole is doing the best he can. Detective Cole, you know, he wasn't there. You were there and I was there. Look, Mr. Nolan. I shouldn't be telling you this, but Auggie Rose was an ex-con. -What was he in jail for? -Armed robbery. Give us a couple of days. Something will turn up. When did he get out of prison? Three weeks ago. Look, I've got to go, but take it easy. I have surgery in ten minutes. Make it quick. The other night. A patient. You know? Remember Auggie Rose? -How bad was he? -Mr. Nolan, the patient died. But if things had been different, if there'd been less blood... Unfortunately, when there's a massive wound to the abdomen, we're limited. If we could've operated immediately, it might've turned out differently. But it didn't happen that way. No one could've done anything to save him. Mr. Nolan, are you alright? If you'd like, I can prescribe you something. -No. My gosh. Thanks, no. -You didn't know the patient? -No, no. -You did everything you could've. You did what most people wouldn't have done, you were there for him. He just didn't have a chance. -I appreciate it. -Sure. He was getting started. The odds of this happening to him? Overwhelming. Nobody cares. Everyone's concerned about me. I'm fine. The guy's dead. I know, I know. Look. Let's have dinner. Let's go to a movie. You know what he said to me? In his last moments as he was dying... He was, you know, in pain. But he got, like... still, calm. What kind of fella is it that sits in jail for almost twenty years... and at this moment, he's shot and dying, and lying in an ambulance... why, at that moment, does he look at me, and say: "John, it'll be okay"? I don't know. I... I don't know, John. I wish I knew. Mr. Nolan, come in. Sit down. We can use this office. I've been checking things out. His parents died when he was young. And after that, foster homes, some petty thefts and juvenile time. Then he got sent away. His entire life has been in a cell. In effect, Auggie Rose has no next of kin. -And in prison, any friends there? -There's a cellmate, Oscar Weeks... ...but he isn't the talkative kind. -And so, what happens now to him? It's up to the coroner. They wait an appropriate amount of time. On this case, it's pretty cut and dry. We know exactly where he's been. -Right. And the funeral? -There's no funeral. -The coroner disposes of the body. -Dispose? -He's not a piece of trash. -What would you like us to do? Look at his apartment. Check out his neighbors. Have you done that? An officer was dispatched. But nothing was found. -Don't you think he deserves more? -Look, Mr. Nolan... with all due respect, Auggie Rose was a criminal. He did 20 years for armed robbery, because it wasn't his first conviction. Twenty years in prison. That's hard time. Guys like Auggie last 5, 6 months in the street. Then they're back inside. -Anything more than that is a miracle. -Well, I'll check his place then. I can't allow that. Carol called. She's worried about you. We are all worried about you. John, are you two okay? Yeah, Noreen, we're fine. You and Carol have been together how long? You know, we've been dating six years. John? You two live together. You want my advice? Wine her. Dine her. Take her in your arms... be gentle, be rough. But for God's sakes, John... get down on your knees and ask Carol to marry you. You need a change. Just something. All right. You've got six dollars and twenty seven cents... one Social Security card, a set of keys and one pen. You just sign here. And relationship to the deceased right there. There you are. Hey, I'm sorry about your brother. Hey, 4B, your door's open. I'm coming in. 4B, it's the room with a view. The name's Emanuel. 4A. Across the hall. -No, I'm not 4B. -Hey, you moved in last week. -I'm the guy banging on the wall. -No. I don't live here. -I'm not... I'm not 4B. -Hey, you gotta do me a favor. My sister is getting married upstate. Will you water my plants? -I'm afraid I can't do that. -You don't need a green thumb. All you do is you pour water. They're drowning, and then you stop. -I'm not gonna be able to do it. -Listen, here's the key. I'm not. You don't want to give me these. -There's the horn. Gotta go. -But, wait a second! I... Make all the noise that you want. By the way, you're a spiffy dresser. John Nolan Jr.? Who the fuck are you? Did they... did they tell you about Auggie Rose? -They told us. -I was there when it happened. -They catch the guy? -No. If they do, maybe they'll put him in here with us. -Did you drive up? -Yeah. What did you drive? What kind of car? -A Volvo. -New ones are supposed to be nice. -Got a car alarm? -Yes. I used to love that sound. Breaking in. The alarm wailing. Running down the street. So, what do you want to know about Auggie? Well, I'm trying to locate a friend... like, on the outside, that could claim his body. Take responsibility. There's no one, mister. He'd been in here too damn long. -Really? You sure? -Auggie served his time. Bothered no one. Took care of Charlie. When he got out, the only thing he wanted to do was look at the moon. Mister, they don't let us out at night. Fuck, he don't make it a month. He gets bumped. -I'm really sorry. -What do you care? -I'm trying to do the right thing. -For who? Hey, I was in his apartment and he's got this calendar there... with a date circled in red. The 14th. Does that ring a bell to you? -No. -Time's up! Your car is parked in the visitor's lot, right? In ten minutes, do me a solid? Before you go, set the alarm off. -I don't understand, why...? -Just, just do it, okay? Oh, wait a minute, Mr. Weeks. You mentioned a Charlie? Who's that? Maybe I could talk to him. He'll talk your head off, but you won't get nothing out of him. -Mr. Lark's on the phone. -Who? You sold him a policy. With Carl. -Hello, Mr. Lark. How are you? -Fine. I want to thank you. Anne and I are so grateful. The time you took with us. -My pleasure. All part of the job. -I thought I'd pay you back by... giving you another client. A friend of mine. Bill Wilson. I told him all about you. I gave him your number. If that's all right. Mr... hello, Mr. Nolan? Thanks so much. Don't hesitate to call back with any questions. Where are you goin'? -4B. -He's dead. You the police? -A friend. -You gonna take his stuff? 'Cause I want to rent the place. If you're not gonna take it... ...then I'm gonna throw it out. -Gotcha. -Mister? -Yeah? I'm, I'm sorry that your friend is dead. I'm watering his plants. What am I doing? -Good afternoon. -And for you. Hi, got anything for me today? 4B? -What's your name? -Rose. Auggie Rose. Here you go. "I'm busy planning for this trip that I only have time to write you this. Can you believe the 14th is almost here? I'll leave tomorrow. Lucy." Who in the hell's Lucy? Say, excuse me. I'm sorry. Have you delivered any other mail to this apartment in the last weeks? -I deliver a lot of mail, Mr. Rose. -Think, the last couple of weeks. -Maybe a letter or two. -You think? -Yeah. -Really? Thank you. Thank you. "Hi. My name is Lucy Brown. I saw your ad in the magazine and you seemed like a nice person. It does not bother me that you are in prison. Last year I worked at the county jail as a typist. At first, the inmates were scary. But you get used to them. There was this one guy there I went to high schoolwith. He was in for robbing a tire store, but I knew him just as Doug... his dad was the janitor at the junior high. I'll tell you something about myself. If you like, you can write me back. I am 29 years old..." "I told my friend I'd been writing you and she just about flipped. I told her you hadn't done anything bad like kill someone. Don't be mad, but I let her read one of your letters. Well, Auggie, she almost died. She thinks you are a poet or something. In fact, she wants to know if you have any brothers. In prison or not. My mom lives with her boyfriend in Bazoola... which is the next town over. We fight a lot but we're pretty close as far as mothers and daughters go. My father left us when I was 5. Years ago he tried to get in touch with me... and I didn't know what to do. Mom hated him, said I should hate him too... because he treated me like I was hatched out of an egg or something. It turns out he had cancer. Reverend Daniel said I had to see him. I went to his house where he had a new wife. It wasn't bad... because he apologized for being a jerk. He died two months later." "Dear Auggie, I'm really nervous about sending you a picture. I know you want to see what I look like, but what if you don't like me? If you think I'm a model, you might as well forget it. Last night I did what you said. It was so weird to think that we were lying in bed at the same time... reading letters we had each just gotten. If I closed my eyes, I swore you were here." "Today is the day you got out of prison. I know you want to get a job before we see each other... but it felt like I was there with you. I could just see your face. I cried so much at work, my boss asked if I wanted to go home. But it didn't matter where I was. I was gonna cry anyway." "Dear Auggie, I'm so glad to hear you got a job. I know how worried you were about getting one, but I knew you would. I can't wait to finally see you. I will finally be able to see your face and to hear your voice. I'm getting off work this Tuesday and going straight to the bus station. As I write this letter, it's only five days away. All my love, Lucy." It's three days away now. There you are! Man. Oh, man. I was worried about you! -How you doing? You okay? -Yeah, you? Can't stop shaking. When he pulled the trigger 2nd time, I thought that was it. You know there was nothing either of us could do, right? Auggie was just in the wrong place at the wrong time. You tried, but... there was nothing. -What was he, what was he like? -Who? Auggie? Yeah. Did he ever mention, for instance, a girlfriend, Lucy? -Jeez, he only worked here two days. -Right, right. Okay, take care of yourself, Tony. Hey, you know? There is something. Hang on, I found it this morning. Here. It's his jacket. I was going to give it to the police, but... Here's the thing, Auggie didn't say much. He seemed okay. You know, paid his debt to society. I wouldn't want to cross the guy... but I figured, "what the hell?", so I gave him a chance. -I could... you want me to take this? -Sure. Okay. -Take care. -Thanks. "Dear Lucy, I started that job at the deli. Normally my job title would be "stock boy", but... because I'm older, my boss calls me a store clerk. He could call me "hey you" and I wouldn't care. Who would believe it? I have a job, I get paid, I even have a day off. Today, Tony, my boss, he asked me to make a sandwich for a customer. He didn't even ask me if I knew how. I was nervous as hell. But I guess anyone can make a ham and Swiss on rye." I think we need a vacation. Suzanne and Paul said Coral Lake is great. We can relax, we can fish... I went to his apartment. What? Well, did you find anything? No. Jeez. It just seems so... unfair... to be discarded, and then forgotten. Gosh, I... I hope that doesn't happen to me. -John, you're not alone. Why...? -Did you ever think about... chucking it all? I don't mean like quitting. I mean like... starting over. Are you talking about us? Possibly so. John... ...look, I talked to Roger. -Your cousin? -Yeah. He's got a Ph.D. -Carol... ...it's not like I have a problem. -You said something was wrong. I'm asking questions. I don't need to see a shrink. I'm sorry that he's dead. It's tragic. I know you wanted to help him. But you have seen death before. Car accidents, fires, suicides. You should know life is many things, but fair is not one of them. That's right. That's right, Carol. It's not fair. That's my point. You know, it gives just so many chances. And we waste them... thinking there's gonna be plenty more, but there isn't. Ask Auggie. John, he's dead. John. -Can I help you? -Yeah. I have a pawn ticket here. -If I could get whatever it is... -Redeem it. Redeem it? Thank you. Thanks. -You're a relative? -Yeah. I'm his brother. Who are you? -Actually, I'm a friend of Auggie's. -Let's cut the crap here, friend. You don't know Auggie. Auggie didn't send you here. He wouldn't send anybody in here for this. What happened to him? He came in, and I could tell he'd been in the joint. You can always tell. Their skin is pale as corpses. And the eyes, they watch everything. He wanted to pawn some books, but I could only give him US$ 20. It never occurred to me to ask him if he had anything else. But he comes back, and he brings me this. Say hello to Charlie. The bird belonged to the doctor up at the prison. Few years ago, the doc died and they let Auggie take care of Charlie. Normally I don't take pets, you know, I don't want the responsibility. The thing could die. It's not like a watch, you know? And Auggie, he didn't want to pawn him. But he needed the cash. I was afraid the bird was gonna die. You don't want to do that. A thousand pounds of pressure. -Only Auggie could pet him. -Where's Auggie? So, so, someone Charlie knows. Auggie. -What he says, Auggie said. -That's why you call it a parrot. Right. Right. I'll take him. Hello. -Two hundred dollars. -Yeah. I get it. Rent's due on the fifteenth. Does this place look familiar? Look around, you were here before. Free at last. Oh, that's Auggie's. You're Auggie's bird alright. Look at that. Can I pet you? Yeah, let me. Hey, I'm not Auggie, but don't... You gotta keep your door closed. I came to tell ya the plants look great. My pleasure. Here you go. Thanks, sir. -Charlie here. -That's the noise! It's a bird! -Yeah, it's Charlie. -Hey, listen, I'm starving. -Can I treat you for lunch? -Oh no, it's okay. -I got to repay your kindness. -That's not necessary. I enjoyed it. Okay. But... ... perhaps a rain check? -Good. I'm gonna hold you on to it. -Officer Decker? -Mr. Nolan. We need to talk. The department called the landlord. He said that someone... a friend of the deceased, had moved in. I take it this someone is you? -No, no, no, well... -Is that your bird? No, it's Auggie's. The name's Charlie. Mr. Nolan, I'm not here on official business. I could be, I'm supposed to be. You're trespassing... ...but impersonating the dead... -No, it's not what you think. What I think? You don't want to know what I think. Why are you here? He didn't have any friends, and I'm trying to find somebody who might... We've looked. You've looked. There's no one. What are those? He had a girl who he wrote to from prison. -A pen pal? -Yes, sir. -Does she know what happened? -No. I don't think so. They never, they never met. I don't think they've even spoken. Okay, the department will notify her. Maybe she'll claim the body. Or, I'll tell you what, she comes to town tomorrow on a bus. She's expecting Auggie to meet her at the bus station. -I was thinking that maybe I could... -No, no. Absolutely not. -Under the circumstances. -Officer Decker, listen, please. I sell life insurance. That means I kind of bamboozle people. With a lot of mumbo jumbo. You know? I'm the so-called expert. Give me a guy, and I can tell you when and how he's gonna die. Supposedly. But it's so much horse shit. You know that? I tell them I'm gonna provide for their families. But I don't do that. You know what I do? I make sure they get a check payable at any bank. If this Auggie Rose, this convict that nobody seems to care about... if he had insurance, is that what Lucy Brown would want? A check? No. She deserves more than that. He deserves more than that. Please! Please, let me go down there... And tell her that Auggie Rose is dead? -Yes. -That is what you're going to do? Yes. Auggie? Yes. I was sitting next to this woman who was real uppity. She had a red hat on with feathers. She never took it off the whole trip. Not even when she was sleeping. But then she told me that she was from London. Okay, which I figured, explained everything. I'm babbling. I'm totally babbling. But I think it's weird... seeing you after all this time, Auggie. -I'm a little bit of nervous. -Okay, me too. -What? -Gosh, I didn't even ask you. How's the job? -You know, it's a job. Just a job. -It's your first real job. -Come on. What's it like? -Well, you know, it's a... Well, you know, I work in a deli. I'm a stock boy. My boss knows I'm older, so he calls me a store clerk. -That's nice. -And the first day... my boss asked me to make a sandwich for somebody. Well, what happened? I made the sandwich, and wrapped it up, and gave it to the customer. And the customer said "thank you". Which, you can imagine... nobody had said to me for a long time. Sweet. Hey, excuse me. Do you know of a good motel around here? The Waverly. It's two blocks up. Convenient. -You're not gonna stay with me? -No. -You never asked. -I didn't? Auggie, I know you have so many things on your mind. Getting out and getting yourself situated. So I thought the best I just try to find a place to stay until... ...you know, until... -Right. Lucy? Do you... want to stay with me? Yes. -Do you live close? -Not far. -The bag's heavy. Can we walk there? -I don't know, let's take... ...a cab? -Okay. Here we go. It's dark in there. Don't trip. Here we go. It ain't much. I know. I know that. No, I think it's beautiful. Best of all, it's yours. Goodness. Did you read all these books? Oh, my Gosh! No wonder you wrote such good letters. I almost forgot! Come here. Sit down. -Open it. -I feel bad I didn't get you anything. Just open it, silly! -It's a Hawaiian shirt. -I didn't know what to get you... then I remembered that you told me that all you wore was brown clothes... so, I figured, after twenty years you could use a change. Look at that, with all the postcards of all the places we're gonna go. Thank you. It's very beautiful. I'm so glad I'm here. Is that what I think it is? That depends on what you think it is. Well, I think it's Charlie, your bird. It is! Oh my God, he's adorable. Charlie. Meet Lucy. Lucy, meet Charlie. -Did your daddy tell you about me? -I sure did. -Aren't you sweet? -He's not so good with strangers. I'm no stranger. I'm Auggie's girl. Look. -Oh, I guess he is. -Hello, Charlie. Hello. -He likes you. -Hello. Oh, there you go, pal. There you go. Where's Auggie? Well, Auggie's right there, you silly bird. Very good boy. -You must be exhausted. -Well, I'm a little bit. Maybe we should go to bed. I have to freshen up first. -Good night, Charlie. -The bathroom. -Damn it. -Auggie? Auggie! Auggie? You have no tub in the bathroom. No. There's a, isn't there a... There's a shower, isn't that okay? Yeah. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute, wait a minute. I have to say something. I care about you, you know that, don't you? It's just that I haven't been with a woman in a long, long time. Most guys would be jumping at this chance, of course, but... I don't know if I can make it right. Yet, you know... you, you, you deserve it to be... to be right and... So I hope you know I'm thrilled that you are here. I think it's the sweetest thing I've ever heard. -But, Auggie? -Yeah? Do you have to sleep in your clothes? Okay, then. Auggie? Wake up! Good morning. Alright. I didn't know what kind you liked, so... I got you one of each. You didn't have to do that. Sleepy head, you gotta get out of bed, or you'll be late for work. Work. I like this. Auggie, these shoes look awfully expensive. What are you gonna do all day while I'm at... at work? Don't worry about me. I've got Charlie. Hi. I waited... by the phone worried sick that something might have happened. I kept thinking two bad things in a row couldn't possibly occur. The odds are too great. Unless, of course, you were to do something yourself. -I'm sorry. I tried to call. -Can you tell me where you were? -It's not what you think. -Not what I think? What do I think, John? Tell me. Just answer me this: How many more nights will you not be coming home? I don't know. Your suitcase is in the hall closet. Bill Wilson's on the phone. Friend of the Larks, wants to buy life insurance. That's what we do here. Give that to Carl. -What's with the suitcase? -It's a bag. Stay. -Are you going somewhere? -Yeah. For like a few days. -Off where, John? When? -Right now. Mr. Wilson? Mr. Wilson? Charlie. Lucy? Hello. Here it comes. -Hey, 4B! Come on in. -Hi, Auggie! You got a wonderful girl here. On top of that, she tells a very funny story. -I know. Are we intruding? -Get out of here. I dragged her in. -I wanted to show her the plants. -So maybe we should take off? What about that rain check? You know, we could get something to eat. Romeo. Romeo. We're for the usual, Romeo. -And you, friends? -Me? I'll have... ...a cheeseburger. -No burgers, my friend. Chinese food. -Give them my usual. You'll love it. -You gotta it. Our building is a dump, but it's cheap. Where did you move from? Me? That's a long story. -Auggie was in the state pen. -Yeah? Most everybody has seen the inside of a cell. When did you get out? A couple weeks ago. Tell me something. When you first got out, that first day, what did you do? You know, just it was good to be out. Walked around. And? And... They don't let us out at night. It had been almost twenty years since I'd seen the sky at night. It's gonna sound corny, but that first night... when I looked up and... saw stars... and felt wind blowing... that's when it hit me. I realized I could do anything I wanted to do. Like making choices. Like being in here and... eating what I wanted. It was freedom. You hear that Romeo? Welcome to the neighborhood, 4B. Auggie? -Hi. -Hi. Hi. Can I come to see you at work? Well, I hired one of you guys once, you know? And he robbed me. So what do you expect me to do? Hire another one? You gotta be nuts. Sorry. No way. It's just not worth it, you guys. Can I help you? Auggie, right? Auggie Rose? I was in here the other night buying cigarettes. Someone said your name. I heard you talking about being inside. So I figured it was you. You were supposed to call last week. What happened? Something came up. I'm on parole. I know what it's like. Just breathing is different. It doesn't matter. Forget it. Oscar Weeks says you are good people. -Oscar? When did you talk to him? -The week you got out. He said you might be interested, you might not. I'd let you make up your mind. You got time? Take a ride with me. You ride a bus. You take a subway. Where does the money go? Come here. All those dimes and nickels, dollar bills... it all comes here. Transit Authority, everyday to get counted. It's about 200 grand in unmarked bills. You did banks. This is better. Only 2 guards. My buddy works for the company that cleans the uniforms. Twice a week he picks up the old clothes. He drops off new ones. He can get us in. There's no tellers. No customers. Just us and the money. What do you think? -What about the guards? -I figure that's where you come in. Well, maybe right after lunch. Their stomachs are full. They're feeling groggy. I like that. Come here. You'll like this. Nice, huh? Go on. When was the last time you held one of those? -Been a long time. -Well, it's yours, man. -What? -Sort of an advance. Don't sweat it. So you in, or what? I don't know, Roy. Auggie, you got yourself a job yet? -No, I don't. -Rehabilitation. I can respect that. -You got yourself a gal now... -How do you know about her? Relax, man. You were with her at Romeo's. Damn, you're all wound up. Re-entry's tough, I know that. You gotta think about this. This job has got your name written all over it. All over it, man. Auggie? Do you like this kind of lipstick? -Pink? Yeah. Sweet. -Thank you. -Lucy. -Yeah? What if... I wasn't who you thought I was? What kind of talk is that? What do you know about me? What you read in a bunch of letters. How do you know I'm not... I mean, how do you know I'm not gonna slip up? Wind up back in prison? I don't. That's why my ticket is round trip. Anything else? You only want to work in a deli? You got a thing for corned beef? No. It's hard to explain. Mr. Rose, you're an ex-con. Flexibility has to work in our favor. -Why not check this factory job? -No. It's gotta be a deli. Come back in a couple of days. Maybe I'll have something then. I hope you don't mind my asking, but... what were you in prison for anyway? Bank robbery. At least I'm not asking you to find me a job as a teller. Good thing, yeah. -Deli? -Yes, please. -I filled out an application. -What's your name? -Auggie Rose. -Hold on a minute. -The position's filled. -I'm sorry. I couldn't hear you. -I'm sorry. The position's filled. -Hello? Hello? Hey, Auggie. What are you doing? Let's go get a beer. Somebody bought you a beer since you been out? Thanks, sweetheart. God damn, man! I knew this guy who put ice in his beer. He didn't get ice in prison. He was gonna make up for it double time. He'd put ice in everything. Beer, coffee, milk. -You want ice? -No. I'm good. How's that job hunt coming? Not, not good. As a matter of fact, the... you know, I've been away so long... I bet there are a lot of other guys who could do that job better than me. You know what I think? The toughest thing about not being in the joint is? Finding someone to watch your back. Inside, you know your partners, and who will give you the shank. Out on the street, man, you don't know who to trust. You're all alone. Unless you're one lucky motherfucker. Now, is that you? No. I didn't think so. Besides, how many ex-cons you know gonna pass up 100 grand? You drink your beer. I think he's lying to me. He told me he had a job, I don't think it's true. I asked him if I could come see him at work and he said it was too soon. -That's possible, you know? -Maybe, but... I just have a feeling something is not right. You think he's in trouble? I don't know. Well, there was nothing on the computer. I even called our competitors to see what they had. Nothing. So I figured you were screwed. Until this morning. This place I go for coffee. What's in the window? A help wanted sign. No? -I promise nothing, but it's a shot. -You're very good. Oh yeah, I'm good. -Do you have any experience? -Yeah. No. Don't sweat it. It's not a tough job. When can you start? -I could start today. -Good. Let's get crackin'. -I have the job? -Six fifty an hour. -You're okay with my application? -Frank? Help Auggie here get started. He's our new clerk. I knew he was an ex-con the second he walked in. It's in their eyes. The only car on this lot suitable for a man of your taste would be this BMW. No, no. I got something else in mind. Hey, I've got a Lincoln coming in. Cherry. What about that? -That? That's not for sale. -Why? Is something wrong with it? No, it's mine. 1300 cc's of pure freedom. Trade ya. What do you mean? Even? Is there any other kind of trade? What do you think? It's you, baby. Auggie, how can we afford this place? I know what you're thinking. All booked up. No reservations. You're looking at us, not dressed for the occasion. But, mister... you may not believe it, but I haven't had a decent meal for 20 years. The whole time, the only thing I was thinking was bringing my girlfriend... to Marino's and getting her what I know is the finest meal in town. Twenty years? Where were you? Prison. Table 14. Right this way. Just came in. Haven't even priced it yet. -She's a beauty though, huh? -Yep. Take a look inside. It was owned by a widow from Canoga Park. -What do you think? -She's a beauty alright. Let me go inside the office work up a price for you. I'll be right back. Auggie, that was the most fantastic meal I ever, ever had. -What is this? -That's for you. That's for you. It's the address of where I work in case you want to come visit me. Nice bike. One pack? -Auggie. Help these people, okay? -Yes, sir. -Hi. What can I get for you? -I'll have a ham and Swiss on rye. Tuna salad on whole wheat. Okay. Coming right up. Thanks. -Looks great. -He'll ring you up right over there. Hi. Keep your eyes closed. Keep your eyes closed. Okay. Come on. A little further. Keep them closed. It's a great big surprise! Wait a minute. Yes, I'm right here. Okay, wait. There. Stay. Okay. Stay right there. Hold on. Okay, open'em. Lucy? There's a bathtub in the apartment. Remember you wrote me in prison that they only let you take showers? I felt bad when I saw the apartment didn't have a bathtub, and I felt that... you deserve to soak in a nice hot tub and do nothing like the rest of us. Come on. Take your clothes off. The water's gonna get cold. This is heaven. Thank you. Can I help you? I like your flowers. What color is this vase? Files? Is that purple? -It's mauve. -I'm sorry? Mauve. M-A-U-V-E. And that's a color, like purple? Where's lavender fit in? -Are you here to buy insurance? -Yeah. From him. John Nolan. -He's not in right now, but... -If he's at lunch, I can wait. -Mr. Nolan is on vacation, but... -For how long? -What? -For how long is John on vacation? And what did you say your name was? You tell him Auggie stopped by. Auggie Rose. He'll know. So? How do you know Auggie? We got mutual friends. -Who? -Cellmate Oscar Weeks. Know him? Not personally. But Auggie has told me about him. He tells you a lot of things. He didn't tell you about me? He didn't mention nothing about our business together? -What do you want? -I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I figured you and I had something in common. Auggie and his well-being. -Has he been acting strange? -Auggie is doing just fine. -Insurance? -What? He mentioned anything about insurance? Auggie's gonna be... ...awhile. Maybe... -I'll wait. Does your bird bite? No. Does Polly want a cracker? You want a cracker? If you don't mind, I'm gonna ask you to leave. -Fuck! -Oops! Listen, it was really nice to meet you, I'll tell Auggie that you dropped by. White trash piece of shit. I'm gonna teach you some fucking manners. Mr. Mason, don't make me ask again! Please. If it ain't my own fucking gun. Go on. Go! Go! Go! He called me stupid white trash after he said he was your friend! -I'm sorry. He's somebody I met. -He's trouble, that's what he is. I didn't come all the way out here for you to go back to jail. It was hard enough before. I don't know if I could take it now. -I'm not going back to jail. -You're not? Okay, so... what on Earth are you doing with this gun? -Roy gave that to me. -Do yourself a favor. Give it back. John C. Nolan Jr. I swear to God, man, you had me fooled. How'd you find out? I couldn't figure why you didn't jump on that job, so I followed you. I was like, "Man, why is he driving a brand new Volvo?" "Stupid fucking me", I'm thinking. "He made a score and cut me in". Then I checked around. Auggie's dead. -You killed him? -No. Hey, John, it's a good question. You're here. You're living in his place. You're feeding his bird. You're fucking his pen pal girl! He was working in a deli. There was a robbery. He was shot. -Really? Where do you fit in? -I was there, I saw it. John, where do you fit in? What's the scam? -There is no scam. -Bullshit! You're working some sort of insurance fraud. I figured your angle. Nolan Insurance. I know about that. But I bet Lucy don't. No, no, no. At first, I thought she was in on it. But then I realized... ...she don't know shit. -What do you want? I reckon I don't know yet. I figure you're the smart one. You tell me. What does Roy Mason want? -I'll give you a couple days to figure. -Or what? I hate to see the look on Lucy's face I tell her that you're not Auggie. -She's got nothing to do with this. -Is that what Carol would say? How the fuck do you know about Carol? I did my homework. Now you go do yours. I may be home a little late tonight. Okay. Auggie! -Wait. -What's the matter? -Sit down. -What? What is it? I'm just gonna spill it, okay? There was this guy I was dating. We knew each other since we were kids. And we used to... to joke about getting married... but I never took it for real. Right? Well, we got into this huge fight after he quit his job. That's when I started writing you, figuring that was no big deal. It wasn't like I was cheating on Warren. Warren, that's his name. You know, it's just letters. Well, Warren got another job. And right after that he begged me... Auggie, I swear to God, he got down on his knees... and he begged me to marry him. I didn't think that anything was gonna happen between you and me. Regina, my friend, told me I wasn't getting any younger, so I said yes. The ceremony wasn't big. I didn't even buy a wedding dress, I just wore my Sunday church clothes. Then, then you started writing me more and more. And I started writing you, more and more and... it's gonna sound crazy, but... I wanted a letter more from you than I wanted a kiss from my husband. So what happened to him? Well, Warren found the letters, and he went through the roof. He wasn't jealous, but embarrassed. His wife writing a convict, so... he got the marriage annulled. He made me promise not to tell why. It was four months. That's all it was. -I wanted to tell you sooner, but... -Why are you telling me now? Because you and I are like... a hundred million times better than I ever hoped we'd be... and last night I was telling you how to live your life, and I've got this past! I needed to be honest with you, that's all. You want me to leave. That's okay, I understand that. Back at work, they're waiting for me to call and... say that I'm gonna come back, so... Is that your bus ticket? Yep. -Round trip? -Yeah. -Cash it in. -For real? -Yes, for real. -You've made me the happiest woman! What time of day would be best to tell Lucy you're a fraud? Morning, afternoon? Look at you walking away like you're still pretending to be the bad ass. You got a lot of balls. I come walking down here to find you. What is this? Auggie's insurance policy. You're the beneficiary. Get the check. -You're giving me paper work? -It's worth a hundred grand. All I gotta do is fill this out, and I get 100 cash? Payable at any bank. -How did you swing all this? -I'm an insurance salesman, remember? I wrote the policy. Nobody's gonna suspect a thing. But you better leave me and Lucy alone. And Carol. You understand? A hundred grand, you don't even exist. But this policy goes south, you're a dead man, John Nolan. That's me in the poster. 1948. Golden Gloves Champ. That good-looking guy? No. That's not you. Sure. The girls hanging around me like fireflies. Look at this. Solid gold. Fifty one years. Never took it off. -Look at this. Real gold. -Good fighter. Good jab. Ask Romeo, he was in the ring. Wanna hear something? One night, my best night. Fighting a15 rounder at the old Palace with Jacko Annetti. I mean, it's even for eight rounds. Jab, jab, jab. Never let him know I have the combination. Make him wonder: "Where's the upper cut?" Then hit him with it. Comes to the 9th. Jacko comes out with everything that he has. My eye is cut bleeding. I mean, he pounds me in the 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th round. He must've figured he's got the fight won. That's when I come up on him. -Jab, jab, jab. Bam! -You put it to him. No, he put it to me. I was on the mat out cold. -You said it was your best fight. -I said it was my best night. I mean, Jacko was an animal. Nobody would beat him. You know, it's easy get in the ring thinking you're gonna win. Try getting into the ring knowing you're gonna lose. I mean, that's a truth most fighters never know. I'm gonna go down to the bus station. I'm gonna cash in my ticket. You know we could use the money, but I don't want to rush anything. Lucy? Lucy, hang on a second. -Can I talk to you? -Sure you can. Sit. Could you sit please? What's up, my darling? Listen to me, Lucy. Listen to everything I'm about to say... because every word is the truth. A couple of weeks ago... I was in a deli. It's kind like MacDougall's, you know? And there was a robbery. And the store clerk was shot. And I tried to help him. And I got his blood on my... on my hands. I noticed that we kinda looked alike. Not a whole lot, but like maybe cousins, or something, anyway... he died that night... and the cops... were gonna like just dispose of his remains. I wanted to do something. A man had died, you know? See his friends. Console his family. Go to the funeral. But it turns out he didn't have anybody... because he was an ex-convict. So... I went to his apartment looking for a clue, someone to claim the body. The mail was getting delivered. There was a postcard for 4B. This apartment. It was from you. I read it. Then I found all your letters. And I read them. Lucy... somebody had to tell you that Auggie Rose... in fact... had... had died... and, and I swear when you got off that bus, I was gonna... tell you the truth. But then I saw you... and... I guess I told myself that somehow I could... through me, allow Auggie to know what it's like to finally meet you... and talk to you and hold you in his arms. He earned it, without you I don't think he would've made it, but... now, of course, I realize that... that it's just the most selfish... thing I've, I've ever done. The really scary part is how easy it was being Auggie... and I know why. I fell in love. Charlie Bird. Are you still my friend? Lucy? I'm sorry. -I'm so sorry. -So what's your real name? John. John Nolan. Well, John Nolan, I'm gonna go to the bus station today. Will you promise not to follow me when I go? -I promise. -Bye, Charlie. So I'll arrange for everything. His funeral and all of his stuff. -I'll let the coroner know. -Great. So, what happened to the girl? She's gone. You still got the Harley? Well, you know. A couple of years ago I got in my car and drove six days straight. Didn't plan it, didn't pack. Didn't have a map. Just wanted to get away. Stayed in motels. Some good, some bad. Got drunk. Felt great. Then I realized. I knew what I was running from. But I didn't know what I was running to. If there's anything I can do, you let me know. I assume planning a robbery is a parole violation. Yeah. Going up to Coral Lake? By myself. I don't think I've ever done that. Do you ever wonder why we never got married? We'd always say the Spring is nice. "Let's do it in the Spring". The Spring would come and we wouldn't plan anything. It was four Springs ago. Yeah. I'm sorry, Carol. John, whatever you're doing, you're much happier. I'm not a part of it. And you know what? It's okay. -You're back. -I'm leaving. -You just got here. -For good. -What? -Yep. Tell Carl to change the name on the door. The place is his. Wait, what are you talking about? Did I ever tell you you have a pretty smile? We can just turn it around and invest it. John! You're back! These are the Wilsons. Friends of the Larks'. Hi. Have we met? No. Carl is selling us the Cabot Life Plan, what do you think? What do I think? You should go home and make love to your wife... and pray that nothing bad happens... and ask yourself everyday, "If it were to end right now, would it be enough?" That's what I think. Ham and Swiss. Tuna salad. That's right. I am the beneficiary. Roy Mason. Auggie Rose, he's the one who's dead. It's his insurance policy. I'm sorry, sir, but that's not possible. We just checked, and it says that Mr. Rose cancelled it. -What do you mean? He's not dead? -Apparently not, sir. But policy... Fuck policy. I'm supposed to get paid. I'm sorry... Roy Mason, you're under arrest. Let's go! -Motherfucker! -Hey, let's go. -Come on. -Yeah, I got it! My friend, goodbye. You sure tried your best, but... you know, it just didn't work out. Maybe now... Let me pet you, Charlie. Come here. Let me pet you, old buddy. Come... Okay. Charlie. Thank you. -It's a good vineyard. Let's try it. -Good. Auggie? Get me a bottle of that new Cabernet in the back, would you? Yes, sir. Hi, Auggie.
