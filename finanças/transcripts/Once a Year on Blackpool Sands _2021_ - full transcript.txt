[music playing] [woman] OK, love. Breathe. Steady yourself. [shaky breath] He's very close now, darling, so you just steady yourself. Is he? Eddy's holding it together. I tell you, the strength and dignity of that man, it's amazing. Oh, fuck. It's so out, Kate, just like Jason all over again and Max and Charlie. No, love. Darling, if you're going to be with them at the end with Tommy-- Yeah. Yeah, I know. Pull it together. [breathing deeply] [approaching footsteps] I'll just pop this in here. [clanking] You all right, love? Sorry, is he-- Not yet but not long. We still have time for his party. [bottles clinking] Well, look what flew in on a broomstick. Chuffing hell. Honestly, I swear, the water from the tube is getting longer and longer. Thank god, I wore my flats. Oh, afternoon Nurse Ratchet. I bought nibbles. You can never tell how long these final moments are going to last for. Her last one went till all night. And I got a little bit peckish. Oh, I heard Petra is making a baklava. Did you bring the ouzo? Did you bring the shot glasses? [crying] Hey. Come on, mate. He did a remarkable thing, you know, way back. So brave. They've been fighting for fucking years for our rights. Fuck! [sniff] [music playing] The bravest thing-- and I mean, it's hard enough now. But can you imagine back in the '50s? Back then, all those things they told us, Rob, in Greece, all those things in that story-- What story? They trusted me with such a story. It's such a story. Hmm. [clank] Edna, Betty, can one of you just get up? Our Thomas forgot he's packing again. [music playing] Well, there's a posh couple from Leeds take a day trip down to London. And he's a bit of a swap, bit of a show off. And he takes her to the National Gallery no less. And he's talking out his asshole, you know, the way these management types do. [boisterous laughter] --and I see this painting, and they're both shocked. Mrs. Gore's the color of beetroot. Three naked men sitting on a park bench. Two with Black dicks, one-- smaller one, mind-- pink as you like. Well, the man is right flummoxed, so they ask the lady in charge. She comes over, stares at it for a bit. Reckon it's a symbol of African oppression. Bloody hell. And then this bloke from Yorkshire pipes up, "Is it buggery?" And Mr. Twat Know All says, "Uh what makes you think you know more about art than what's in charge?" And he says, "I fucking painted that there-- three Yorkshire miners! The middle one went home for his lunch." [laughter] Hi, mum. Not interrupting, am I? No, lad. I'm just telling our Joe about diesel. He likes to keep abreast of what's going off. How much you tell, then, mum? Tommy. Mum. Not today, all right? He's broken, you know. Inside, summat's been damaged. This whole town knew what were going off in that house, and not one hand were raised in protest. Not one. The bloody church. That God's got a lot to answer for. Well, it's a marvel how you've been a friend to him all these years. But one of these days-- Folk don't know him like I do. Milo, if you squish my baklava, I'll be wearing your bollocks as earrings. Put it in the fridge before it drips. I haven't. Now, where's my Tommy Price? Oh my God. It's Nana Mouskouri. Sorry, dear. I don't speak cunt. Darling, you look amazing. This old thing? I've had it for years. How's my Little Prince? He's looking brighter. Bit woozy. It's morphine. Wait till you taste my baklava. I just know you're all gagging for it. Nobody's gagging for that. [laughs] Here you go, Betty Grable. Food. [pigeon cooing] I know, tastes like muck. [cage door creaking] All right there? So you-- Were talking to them daft birds? We get more sense out of these daft birds than I do you. Yeah? Your mum's at the church. [gentle music] Your dad's in the pub. Mm-hmm. Are the girls home? No. We can risk a little dance. Little kiss? What are you doing, you daft bugger? Sorry about before. Just have it on. Took it to right now I'm going to start punching walls. Eddy-- OK. You have to-- Have to what? What do I have to? Keep it under control? Keep it locked out of sight? No, this-- this, this-- this is love. This is love. See what you do to me. From tomorrow, Eddy. From tomorrow, Eddy, we're on holiday. We have our own room-- No. A bed. No, no, no. Tommy, I need to feel your skin now. I need to have you against me now. I-- I love you so fucking much, I can't breathe Eddy. I can't. I can't. No, Eddy. Fuck it. [panting] [unzipping] I've got some coronation cake, boys! Shite! --if you want for them birds, love. No time, on my way. The farmer called. Fancy a brew, lads? Sorry. There are days, Tommy, when I've-- I feel like a trapped animal. Like I'm bleeding out. Caught in a fucking snare. No time, mum. There's a darkness in me, lad. Powerful darkness. If you ever give up on me, I don't know-- Never will. Yes. I never have and I never will, all right? And you listen to me. I know you better than anyone. I know you better than any mortal soul on this Earth. It's not darkness, you numpty. It's him. He's done this to you, Eddy. Eh? All right? [pigeon cooing] All right? [wings fluttering rapidly] I'm sorry. Sorry. What about our brew? Fucking brew? I hate him, Tommy. I hate the very air he breathes, and she's no better. Cures everything, does a brew. Does he, now? Everything from a broken leg to a broken heart. You're right, Tommy. He was a bastard, and he needs to pay. Oh, Tommy, lad. You're playing with fire. He needs to fucking pay for what he did. Eddy, don't! Eddy, we're on holiday tomorrow, for-- sake. He did this to me. Eddy, please. Eddy! Clean. Has clean. Eddy. It was him. And the shame-- [yelping] The shame-- [gasping] Eddy, Eddy, please! Just leave him-- Look at me, you bastard. Look at me. Just leave him be. Eddy. He just needs to-- You need to stay out, mother. Stay out. Stay out. Eddy! Eddy! Please! [sobbing] I've put the clean towel in there, and I've put some decent soap inside your underpants. That place you're going to seems under par to me. Now if you two want to fat around so much, you could have come into Windsor with your family. Can't exactly leave Eddy on his own, can I, mum? No. No, you can't. Hey why don't you nip 'round and ask him to come for his tea? That mother of his can't boil water. I bet he ain't had a decent plateful all week. He reckons he's got something on, mum. He's in one of his moods again. Wake up, lad. That's just his pride talking. She keeps a cold house, does that Agnes Corkhill. Mind you, she spent most of her adult life trying to avoid that monster she married. He's off in one of his faraway places. I can't reach him. I can't help him either, can I, mum? That's not your job, lad. I keep telling you. It's fine. It's fine. Bus leaves at crack of sparrows tomorrow, so don't be too late back. Oh, I won't miss the bus. I'd fucking walk to Blackpool rather than spend the wage week here. Hush, now, or your father will hear. Let him. Let him hear! Don't you ever look around this house, mother? Ever wonder why your sons don't visit? How each one of them left when there were work down the mine. They left because they hate you. [sniffling, whimpering] They hate this. They hate this. And I really must be as stark raving mad as everyone reckons, because I'm still here. Still in this-- these filthy midden still, dream in my life, and fucking wet dreaming of America. Hard life, skyscrapers, all of it. Why do you want to hurt me? All the time, day, all day-- You're not hurt! You don't feel. You don't know how to bloody hurt. I'm here because of Tommy Price. That's the only reason. I love him, mother. I love the bones off him. You hear that, father? You hear that? Yeah, he can still hear. How dare you speak like that in your father's house? My father? How dare you. This is a house of God! House of God! House of God. House of God. I dare you're drunk. How dare you say such vile things? You hold your mouth, mother. If you breathe-- if you breathe one word-- one word to Alice Price, I swear I'll strangle you with me bare hands, you hear? I will. It's an abomination. You know, one of these days, that old bastard is going to die. And that, mother, will be the one and only time I will pray-- fall to me knees, and I'll clasp me hands together. And I hope, and I hope, I hope it's a quiet day for your God, I do. I do. A Tuesday, maybe. A half day in heaven because I want him to hear me. I want him to get the message send that sadistic animal downstairs to hell, where his flesh will scorch and he will spend-- look at me-- you will spend eternity in agony. You will. You will. Eddy. And then, and then when your time comes, mother, same message. Tell him to move over and make room for you. Eddy. I tried. No Yeah, we're excited to go Blackpool, aren't we? [all cheering] [chanting] Very tripping funny, you tossers. Hey, I'll have you know vertigo is a proper illness. Hey, there were some boogers scared of heights stone pit. Yeah, bloody sky. Come on, here he is, Sick Noah Sydney. See, it wasn't my idea of a national health service. I'd have knocked out straight on that, wouldn't I? Eh? Calm down, lad. Go get yourself a pint. They're only pulling your leg. Full house. We're not in Blackpool yet. If there's one thing that rattles my teeth, it's folk having a good time. Disgusting behavior, if you ask me. One more pale ale, then I must be making tracks. I'm doing ham this year. You? Egg and cress, same as always. On best Hovis of course, as its wakes. I hope they come down on the bus, bloody heathens. When you're management, family or no family, I'll not be having that lot in my three-bedroom semi-detached with indoor facilities. Not on your Nelly. Do you hear me? I'm sorry, my little mushy pea. I feel fragile, I really do. Anyway, don't get the hump. It's wakes night tonight. You know? Sex? Sexual intercourse? Oh, flying pigs might go by. Really, I'm pissed off, Wilfred. They should take him to bed and have him put down. He's harmless. Leave him be. Can barely walk. Give us a hand, Tommy. He don't care. Look at him, running around after Eddy like a bloody lap dog. Bloody hell. Your fancy woman must be somewhere to Wakefield at this hour. She is, man. I swear to God she makes Jayne Mansfield look like dog shit. Whoever she is, I hate the bitch. Aye. Night, all. Enough of a mystery man malarkey. It's chucking out time. In fact, it's past chucking out time. You waitin' for the last bus then. You must be. Otherwise you wouldn't be sat here, would you? Question is why. Don't ask. Why? Why? Why? Why? You wouldn't understand. What's to understand? Go Blackpool come tomorrow. Half the town's home packing. The other half shift in pints. Me old fella's legless. Half the town was in the pub tonight. The lot apart from you, the best man. Obviously you've got-- No, I just need this. Don't fucking push me, Tommy. Don't fucking push me. I just need-- It's bedtime, Eddy. It's under my skin, Tommy. Can't fucking breathe. This place, this place, it strangles the bloody life out of me. I just want to be somebody else for a bit. To walk in a place where every pair of fucking eyes doesn't know every bloody thing that's ever occurred in your life. The last time I took a shit. All right? That too much to bloody ask? Don't be late. I won't. A whole week, Eddy. Place to ourselves. I know. I know, I just need-- Yeah. I understand, mate. You think I don't, but I do. Just watch yourself, OK? I will. You must have some bloody money to burn if you're going to Wakefield for a pint. Could have had one here, you daft sod. A pint? You-- Aye. See you tomorrow. You think I'm a pint? Where are you off to at this hour, Eddy? Me and our Dot usually have bus to ourselves. Keep your money, love. My treat. Hmm. Thank you very much. Hello, dear. All right? Might as well sit next to me. Keep each other company. All right. [coughing] Oh, it's you again. I've not seen you in a good while. You all right? Did you book it? The guest house? Aye. Aye, I did. She's as mad as a box of frogs, is our Gladdy. But if it's Blackpool and a bit of privacy you're after, you can't do far wrong. She takes all sorts, even butch numbers like you. Tell her Bonnie sent you and say she owes me a long gin in a frosted glass. Bonnie? As in goes like rabbits. Right. Right. I'm off. Apart from you, I wouldn't touch any of these. Oh, bless. Luke. It's a little fawn hiding in the forest. Well, goodbye. Two's company, three's a crowd. Excuse me, sir. Do you have a light? Aye, lad. I do. You're very polite. Put it down to Sunday school. Ah, right. Right. Knees together, back straight, minding one's P's and Q's. Thou shall not have lustful thoughts about Father Paddy doing unimaginable things in the vestry. No, only when I come here. Some men don't care for the more-- well, you know the sorts. But I've seen you here before. You just watch. Same with me. Well, very occasionally I indulge. I have someone, you see. I thought as much. You look like a man that somebody cares for. I was looking at you, and I was thinking, wouldn't it be nice to hold his hand for a bit? All right. Go on, then. [whistle] Fuck, it's the bloody copper. Run. Run. Leave me alone, you bastards! What have I done? [shouting] Shit scumming fairy! That lad needs help! don't show the bastards that you're frightened, and don't tell them your real name. I already did. Mr. Jones, will our names be in the paper? It's jail this time. Edward Corkhill! Fucking bastards. You know, even now, why is it that people think that they could cheat anyone in such a way just because they're gay? You know, when Jason died, when my lover died, in not room full of wires and tubes and that smell, the smell. I heard this woman down the corridor. And then his smartly dressed woman say, I stood next to one in the post office, she said, so nobody could call me prejudice, but these people are diseased and they are dirty. And I looked at Jason as they covered his body in a plastic sheeting so soon after he passed away, and I felt this struggled scream, just wouldn't make a noise. Trapped. Yeah. It's why you lads need to keep fighting. Never give in. Ever. We're gone. Many more to follow, we all know that. And they won't spend money on queers. You just keep fighting. Should never be a time when loving someone to the very core of your soul is wrong. It takes guts to be a queen. They foolishly think it's all glitter and disco. But we're hard as steel beneath. And our time will come. Did you enjoy the pork casserole, James? I thought the sage gave it a little something added extra, don't you? I did consider using rosemary, going against years of tradition, pork instead of lamb. But in the end, tradition won the day. It was either that or killing myself. [singing] It's a long way to Tipperary. It's a long way to go. Are you done? Not yet, my little pork pie. [singing] It's a long way to Tipperary to the sweetest girl I know. Oh. [heavy breathing] Well, that's the shop shut till Christmas morning, so don't be pestering for sexual intercourse in Blackpool. I want to enjoy myself. No, dear. I shall have to calm a tiger the best way I can. He's turned out quite nice, you know. Were a black cloud at top of Bill's mother's house all day yesterday. I says to the lads, I says, let's hope for a spot of sunshine for tomorrow. You know, for Blackpool. Breakfast won't cook itself. Such fuss over a hair clip. Not one that belongs to me, James, your wife. I think that warrants a little fuss, don't you? As I say, I have no idea how that came to be in my pocket, Susan, not at all. Darling, another woman, not one like me, of course, would let her imagination run amok. A feminine object, a husband packing a suitcase, closed in mystery for a seemingly odd but vague trip to Blackpool, of all places. That carries a seemingly odd but vague necessity, considering the line of work you are in. Is that why they keep you and the rest of the moles hidden in the firm's basement? Paper pushers, procedures, compliance. The very vocabulary would send you into a coma. Is it true you've got guests arriving? Bloody Nora. Is that tea part mushing? Not for the likes of you, it's not. Is it one of them queer sorts again? You deserve a medal, you do, putting up with that. Oh. Turns my stomach. If you ask me, folk should be one thing or the other. And all that makeup. Like clowns from tower circus. It's none of your business who stays in my establishment. I can see why they'd be comfortable here. They go for the more garish, don't they. You can't afford to be picky, can you? Well, I most press on. I've got a Victoria sponge on the rise. My guests enjoy a bit of home baking. We go the extra mile here. Now shop rot. So your mother were making a show of herself again last night. Call me old fashioned, but dancing on table and mooning at the Bandstand at her age. Trust me, Gladys, no one wants to see her wire wool, I can assure you. Oh. It must be painful, dear. Sorry? That cork stuck up your arse. Your best get see a doctor, get a bit of lubrication. [interposing voices] One minute, Tommy Price, and not a minute more. You think on lad. If I don't see sea at Blackpool 3:30 on dot as arranged, I won't be best pleased. You can count on that. Alright Mrs. Spoony he's coming. Calm down. And so is pig in Christmas. If my egg and cress go on the coal, you can be expecting my wrath in biblical proportions. Mom, tell her, will you? Ellis Price won't be telling me out, not the way your family carries on. Heathens, the lot of you. Calm down, you old windbag. Blackpool will still be there. What's a few minutes? Keeping everyone waiting is shameless, that Eddy Corkhill. Oh, he's bloody coming, all right? He won't let me-- he wouldn't miss this. Once a bloody year we get this place. No doubt tom catting some trollop. Can't keep it in his trousers, apparently. Oh, take that look off your face, Perrier. You're enough to curdle milk. You're on bloody holiday stop acting like you're sitting on a trapped fart. Well we wouldn't be if that reprobate would show up. He's here. He's here! Tommy! He's here. Eddy's here. Eddy, what's happened? What is it we thought-- are you bleeding? You all right? Going on all day. [cheering] Oh. Bloody hell. Go on, Tommy. Don't keep folk waiting. (SINGING) And if one green bottle should accidentally fall there'll be eight green bottles standing on the wall. Eight green bottles hanging on the wall. Eight green bottles hanging on the wall. And if one green-- May I ask, what was that strange aroma? Oh, that'll be mother. It's her age, if you catch my drift. Eat your puff. Do you by chance have an alternative room? Where there's a will, there's a way. Come on there, don't be soft. You're old enough to tell it to do one. Maureen, she treats you like a chair and I am sick of running around like some love struck teenager. Come to Liverpool. We can get married. No, sir. I'm never getting married. Well, unless Tab Hunter should ask me, which he won't, seeing as he's in Hollywood, America, and I'm still here in this pig's palace. Might be a bit more much, with the geography. What do you mean? Sh! Come, tonight. Let's get this done and dusted, all right? Oh, so you can have sex on top? Sh! Yeah, why else? I want to, I do. I just-- Maureen, you're dancing with one eye on the door waiting to see if there might be a better offer. And there won't be. Very sure of yourself. I am. That's because I have an enormous willy. That means I get everything I desire. Disgusting. May I present the bridal suite. I've got an egg custard cooling. I'll bring you a piece up in a bit. Enjoy. Did you see what I just saw on the landing? A man in a dress, and a horrible dress at that. I will not share a WC with a person who cannot decide whether to stand or sit. And as for that bag of old bones and rags, the one with the fox, who greeted you like some sort of-- Oh. Well, you know, Sandra, it's reasonably priced. Money don't grow on trees, you know. Bleek times. Need to tighten our belts. Look. This bed seems comfy enough. Dread to think, get your feet off the bed. Honey, look at this stain. Oh, no. You are going to have to find an alternative establishment, quick sticks. Oh, I can feel bloody fleas crawling all over me. I could cry, if I was that way inclined. It's disgusting. It's a sham, that's what it is. This place has gone from rat to ruin. Back in the day went out like this. What are you blathering on about now, Reginald? I mean, is it safe to sit? Pass me that magazine. You know, when i was in variety, this place were proper grand. Oh, great. You stop here, Sandra. Well, if these walls could talk, Sandra. The parties, the women. Well, thank the Lord you put that sinful life behind you and married me. Besides, you were never very funny. I think folk used to squeeze out a chuckle more out of pity than mirth. I know I did. Oh, she had room, Sandra. Ethel. Boy, back in the day, she had the room. She had a voice like a canary, mouth like a sewer. She owned that stage as if it were glued to her feet. I would give me right arm for one moment like that. Are you done? Come on. We are leaving right now. Reginald, get up! These walls, thin as sliced ham. Now then, Reg. I know you've only got one bollock, but for fuck's sake, start using it and put this snotty bint in her place. Sorry, Ethel. You will be, married to her. Well, I run a clean house here. Unlike her next door, that flighty piece. She got bedbugs as big as bath buns. And as for a so-called full English breakfast, I don't know who eats that slop for breakfast in England. Nobody in Lancashire, that's for sure. Her marmalade has never so much shook hands with a Seville orange. Wait till you partake of my homemade cumberland sausage ring. It's so moist. There's naught worse than a dry ring. Shall I lay out your smalls, then? Oh, I beg your pardon? It's all part of the five star service. Nay, we can we can tend to ourselves, if it's all right. Yeah, fine. Fine. Oh, well. As you wish. You will have noticed my decor. I'm very big on Hollywood. I like to think my icons are keeping a watchful eye, so don't be fetching any girls back. Not in front of Joan. It's a little quirk of mine. I have a Hollywood staff at every occasion. I slip them on like a second skin. Miss Crawford, Miss Davis, Miss Turner. Right. Well, we need a swill, if you don't mind. A swill? Aye. A wash. Yeah, aye, a wash. We said we'd meet my family for a puddle swim and then-- Fish supper. Supper. Yeah, fish-- [interposing voices] Well, when you're ready to bathe and take your evening toilette, you'll find the facilities top and right. You'll need a shilling for the water meter, mind. Right. A wash, then. Come on, Maureen. Move yourself. What the fuck? Fucking hell. What the hell have I done? We can't stay here. I know. I know. She's as batty as a fruit loaf. Fuck me, look at this place. What are you talking about? That maid, she's fucking copped on. She knows. No. Did you not see the way she's looking at us? It's like she's looking right through us. And I could tell she were thinking, you're not fooling anyone with your nice manners. Your one bloody suitcase, you bloody share any bruises. She basically said it out loud. You pair of fruits. It's not funny, man. We can't stay here. Does she hell as like. She don't know what fucking day it is. Go ahead. She... besides-- Besides what? What now, Eddy? Well, I think-- Look, Tommy. There's something you need to know about this bed and breakfast. Oh. Maureen. Hello. Come in, why don't you? Your mom sent you some fancies. These plum tarts are to die for. I thought you'd be ready, Mr. Elbridge. See? Told you we'd be safe here. We can swing naked from the banister and nobody will bat an eyelid. However did you know about this place? Some bloke I overheard. In the park, I think. The park? Which park? I don't recall. What's with all the questions? Now. Just now. Anyway, let's be getting up. Promised me dad we'd meet him down the pier. Five more minutes while I cover you all over me. Tell me, look out that window. What do you see? I don't know. Look. I don't know. Falcon holiday. Partly eaten ice cream. See that stretch of sand just pass the donkey rides? I do. That's our stretch of Blackpool sands, that is. That's the very spot, three year ago today. All you did was brush my shoulder. Be ready, you says. You call it the song. And I knew-- I bloody knew that this thing we'd been hiding for so long was all the time right in front of me. All I had to do was reach out my hands. I wanted to cry. Wanted to stand there out on that beach and weep. How about this one? Dear God, no. Afraid I'm running out of options, Ethel. Mr. Elbridge, look. It's Phyllis. Indeed it is. Now then, Phyllis, what is that frock saying? I beg your pardon? I've got a frock that'll do the trick. This old slag from the follies once told me, when you're dolling yourself up, find a frock you'll see falling to the floor in less than two hours. The best place for a nice frock, is 'round your ankles. Having a bath, lad. The hot water's still on meter. Tell you what. Ready for this fish and chips. I'm starving already. Don't. Stay in. Blimey. What? Can't do something daring? Live a bit risk free once in my life? Wash me hair. Really? Aye. It's always been a long held wish of mine. And if we really are as free as you say we are, then. Do it slow, Eddy. Fish and chips can wait. Slow, Eddy. [music playing] Look at you. We're safe here, I told you. Did you see the way that Eddie wolfed down my butterfly split fairy. I almost said it out loud. Chew, you bastard. I've spent an age perfecting a mixture as light as air. That's the last time I offer refreshments on arrival, Maureen. Oh, what's the point? I want to feel that knot of excitement way down in the pit of my stomach yet. And we can. You can. Let's go. Let's go. We can-- You and me can just go away. I want to. I can't. Can't be scared of life. You can't. Otherwise-- fuck me, otherwise it's just going to run away from you. It will. If I had money, if I had a 20 brass in my pocket, we'd be gone. We would. Seeing the world, all corners of it. Not like this, never like this. Listen, Tommy. We get a bus to Liverpool, then buy a boat ticket to New York. Me and you. Me and you stand there on the ship's deck surrounded by the mighty ocean sea on all sides. And then we take on New York, Tommy. We take on New York and we win. We fucking win. Yeah. I like the way nowt changes. Each day is the same. And now were frozen off balance. Apart from you. You make my fucking head spin. We can't go back to that town, can we? We can't. There's no fucking room. There's no space for us. And you see these folk. You think you know. You see how fast they turn when you reveal this, and they will. They will, they'll turn like a pack of dogs, I'm telling you. But I won't live a lie. I just won't. I am this. This is me to my very core. And you know what, mate? so are you. You are. You are. Then I'll cut it out of me. No you won't. You won't. I'll put it out of me. No you won't. I will. I'll cut it out of me. I'll force myself to change. I will. I have to. No. I have to, mate. So do you. Always bluster and brave, you must know it's not true for me. It might-- no. I know how you feel, man, but it's who we are, it's where we belong. No. Not anymore. I'm not going back. Open your fucking ears, Tommy. I am never going back. Eddy. Eddy, we have to go back. We have to go back. Find some lass, get wed, and forget this. When that day comes, man, you need to make me one promise, right. Listen to me. You need to make me one promise. When that day comes, you never reach out to me. Don't reach out to me ever again. I won't be able to endure that. Sorry. Could be said I'm quite the connoisseur when it comes to buttered fish. Is it any wonder you haven't got a woman? How's your haddock? Nice. Mine's a bit dry. Tommy, what's the matter with you? You've got a face like a wet weekend. Stop going on at me. Pecking me nothing's wrong. I only asked. Don't only ask. Eat your chips and keep your nose out. Is this you, Eddy Corkhill? Have you been upsetting him? No, it's you lot yaddling away. Him, pissed as a parrot as always. And you pair fight like cat and dog. Aw, shut up, we enjoy it. Do you ever stop and think, do you? When Eddy's sat there. Sat there saying no, you're not fucking going on about whatever. Everything that's gone on with him. One week bloody year, we get. Yeah, I know, we come as a job, but we call Blackpool mob handed, but you selfish fuckers. Tommy, don't. No. let him have his way? Selfish, are we? Am I? Am I? I fed that friend of yours for years. And when men went out on strike, it were me that went without to beat Perrier. All of you. And it were me that bathed his cuts and wash the bloody fleas off him. And your dad, your dad, he what wound up finally stop that Eubert Corkhill with his fists. Tommy! I'm stepping out meself this evening. It's the annual Sewage and Waste Works Dinner Dance. My companion, Deputy Mayor and Councelor Allacock, he's sending me a car. Despite what folks say, it's all a very platonic call. Now then, what about this walk? Seem to have lost my nerve. Such a mess. I was at Dunkirk, you know. But this, it frightens me more. All that noise, all that war. I saw things, such terrible things. What effrontery to mankind. I was brave that day. Tonight, I-- I took a shrapnel to the leg. As I lay there in the mud, the dirt, the stench, I thought to myself, yes. Let me die. Oh, now, now, Mr. Elbridge. Phyllis! For heaven's sake, look at me! It's Phyllis. Phyllis. That moment came such calm. I felt her. All of them. All these women hiding beneath this man's skin. There they are. This body that never felt like it belongs to me. Have you ever considered Denmark? We've had a few booking a year. We are known in such circles. You know that I've shed the caterpillar and found the butterfly, so to speak? We had one. She was so beautiful, Phyllis. Just like you. Sorry if I've unsettled you yet again. I know I do that, unsettle you. Don't. Don't take it out on your mum. She's got thick skin. Not really. I know. I do love you, Eddy. I know. Then what's going on? I mean, it's all out of kilter, isn't it? I wait a whole year for this holiday. I mean, I count down my bloody days and we're fighting. I mean, why are we falling out? One week a year we get to be together and you're spoiling it. Sorry, Tommy. Want to say good night? I don't know what I want. It's all fucked up, isn't it? Ever since you can run to the boss this morning. You're hiding something. I know you are. You're not telling me something. You see, I know you better than anyone. See, you forget I've known you my whole life. Ever since we were nippers. We stood next to each other in line for the nit nurse. Aye. Don't forget a single moment. We always talk about going away. I mean it's not like I've not heard it a million times, but this time's different. This time it chills me to the bone. It's like you're actually going. I am going. What? Why don't you get that? Where are you going? Don't know. America. Over there. Over there? Right over there? This island? You daft sod. Well, it's a start in the right direction, isn't it? Anyway, come on. I told Maureen we'd meet her at cinema later on. Maureen? Yeah, Maureen. My new best man. Oh, right. I just need-- Yeah. Tell them sorry, eh? I'll buy her cream cake tomorrow. [sniffling] You've done great, you know? Must still be raw. Only a few months since. You did the right thing, you know, bringing Tommy home. I was so sick and tired of us hospitals. It's all the rage, lad. It's not like they want us there now, is it? Aren't you scared? I'm not scared of dyin. Fucked off it's so early. I just don't want to leave Tommy. I don't mind telling you, Eddy. You and Tommy, I've never seen two people so in love. It's like I can see this twine between you. But we have to listen to all this hate. It's on the telly, on the radio, in the newspapers. All the time it's fucking everywhere. It makes my piss boil. We're just people, Eddy. We're just people trying not to die. It's not fucking fair. People are dying these terrible deaths and nobody does anything-- not anything-- to try and stop it. Nothing to help. Nothing. Nothing to help you or Tommy or anyone. Not yet. How is he? What's going off, Eddie? He's all right, he's just doing what he always does. He's sorry. I know he's sorry. It's not that. Things have shifted. He's never spoke to me that sharp, all his life. I know. Can I have a cigarette please? A cigarette? Aye. All right. But, in all, I keep on at him. He's not made like you, Eddy. Aye. Oh, love. I didn't mean-- you've got strength. You're stronger, you've had to be. Tommy's not. I just know there's a better picture out there, better for the both of us. What likes you and our Tommy. I'm not blind, love. I've known for years. I knew before the pair of you. I just waited for one of you to tell me. Or not tell me. And then if you didn't tell me, well, it might have just gone away. Well, there you have it. This thing happens for years spoken of, then I pitch up in Blackpool, I can't fucking stop. Sorry. I'm sorry. All I ask. Oh, I see. Of course you couldn't love him. Ma'am. I should do-- Tommy promised we'd go to the pictures with that lass from the guesthouse, Maureen. They're as thick as thieves now. His new best friend, by all accounts. That's nice. If you say so. You're not jealous, are you, Eddy? No. We'll see you tomorrow after breakfast, yeah? You will, love. Yeah. Stanley, I'm so sorry. Can we watch the second show and then-- Gram, what the hell are you doing here? Seeing what all the fuss is about. Your fella. So what kept then? Well, me mum's had me running chuffing cakes up and down stairs all day. And then I literally bumped into Tommy, one of the guests, and he was all upset, so I just went to the chippy with him. Nice. Change of pace. Right. Well don't mind me, then. You can do better. Not exactly Tab Hunter, is he, love? Bloody hell you doing with him? Old enough to be your dad. He's got a massive cock, if it's all the same with you. Where is Eddy? He's coming. He's going to miss the picture. This is me gran. Evening. Speak of the devil. Oh. You're right, Maureen. Pair of handsome of boogers. Sorry, ran all the way. Is she-- She's fine. Do you want to sit next to Tommy? But no snogging or smooching because I don't want to miss-- Fucking hell. What is it about today? God and his dog thinking they can talk about me this way? Some things are private, Maureen, not for you to be giggling about, all right? Calm down, will you? She only having a laugh. I'm sick of it. Eddy, I'm sorry. Now you know. What's going on with you, eh? Sort yourself out. Ruining my bloody holiday with these moods of yours. Fine. Come on, Maureen. We'll go get a pint, shall we? Well, Tab Hunter! Come on. You should go after him. Our Maureen didn't mean harm, lad. It's the way she is. You need to grow a fucking skin. It's hard enough when you're queer. Yeah. You wait. There'll be more shit than sugar to come. And you? Are you? Katya. That was her name. Love of my life. Katya. I lived a life, lad. I saw my chance and I took it with both hands. I see it, lad. That rage. Don't you ever let that go. They hurt me. They fucking hurt me. The police? Yeah. It's what these bastards want, for us to keep hiding like that Mr. Elbridge, like him. Phyllis. Yeah. Yeah, Phyllis. Phyllis. Well, I'll tell you no more. I'm not going back to hiding, aching to touch him, to feel him beside me, sleep holding him. Why is that a crime? How is loving him a crime? Feels I can't breathe sometimes when I see him. It's like the fucking world stops. I mean, he feels the same. He does. Why is that so wrong? Why? Don't ask mother, all right. Don't say a word. I'm humiliated beyond endurance. Might as well come and join our pity party. Maureen's just realize she's going to piss her life away. Phyllis is crying into a sherry because she's lost her nerve again, and I just busted a gut to come and join the party and then caught myself in the mirror, and the penny dropped. I'm old, Gladys. I'm past it. I fucking hate old age. It's a bitch. Well you've got enough piss and vinegar to keep going all the years, mum. You ran off to Russia. You just that. I swear to God, I am going to make that walk tomorrow. This is why I came. Oh, Phyllis. We've had many ladies like you here over the years, right mum? Hundreds. I always remember one of them once said-- I've never forgotten it-- you're never free, you're never truly free, until you let her go out in public. Show her the world. Show her the world. I'm never going to marry Tab Hunter, am I? No. Out with it then, daughter. I was humiliated. I was taking a nibble of my first smoked salmon canape and I was thinking, buy it, Gladys. This is high living, this is. Best of the best with heaven sent trimmings. Then I heard them. Them bitches from the Women's Institute. "She cheats," said one. Cheats. "That can't be me, I thought. Me, who spends an entire day baking, who falls into the depths of depression if a Victoria sponge don't rise into equal parts. She gets the bus to Fleetwood. They do mean me. She buys all the so-called cakes and preserves from Marks and Spencer's and then washes the labels off. Not true. That's a bare-faced lie. Your Victoria sponge is lighter than air. I don't boil my cabbages twice for no booger. I flew at them. Next thing, there's a tray of devils on horsebacks flying. Mavis Bunnage's hairpiece ended up in the sherry trifle bowl. Oh, suffice to say that Deputy Mayor of all Cork is not a happy man. Oh, fuck him and them snotty cunts. Have a beer. Thanks, Mum. What's going on? What's going on? Why be so rude? Poor lass, I am trying to be nice. So bloody sick of it. Everyone at me all the time, fucking making a laughingstock out of me. She wasn't. She bloody was. She wasn't. Everyone treats me like I'm a joke. You know what? I am. Eddy, stop it. I've done it this time. [interposing voices] I'm so angry. Eddy, stop. No, I'm fucking over it. [interposing voices] Fucking waste of air, ain't it? Fucking hell Eddy. For fuck's sake. Feel it, Tommy. Can't you feel this bloody rage? Why can't I love you? Why can't I walk down the street holding your hand? Why do they get to go fucking courting in the bandstands while we look? Stop it. Why is it? It's not right. It's just not right. What the fuck is it? What's wrong, man? It's just so lonely. Tommy. It's been weeks. Fucking weeks since I-- weeks since I touched you, since I kissed you, felt you in my arms. I've been trying to tell you, trying. Open this door right now. What the bloody hell is going on in there? Stop it, Eddy. Go away. Fuck's sake. I paid for this room. Eddy, stop it. I paid for this fucking room, so go away. Go away. I just want the floor to open and swallow me up. I'm so ashamed. But you, you fucker, you won't let me. You never listen. Eddy, for fuck's sake. I'm calling the police. Eddy. Fuck it. [knocking] Open your ears. I paid for this room. How dare you. Fuck off. Well, you can pay for that lamp. And that damage? Joan. What's wrong with you? We can pay, OK? He's sorry. He's really upset right now. I've ruined it all. I want to hurt you, Tommy, in the worst way. Oh, I couldn't bloody wait. Just one more night, but I was so fucking lonely. Snake. Boils inside of you. Wish you were brave like that Mr. Elbridge but I'm not. I'm a filthy coward. Come on, lad. Pull yourself together. Just look at this mess. What would Joan say? It's like a pain in me, God's. I've been trying to tell him. Just tell me. Tell me. Oh, go on. Shall we send for the doctor? What's so wrong with me? Why am I the one who wants to get his guts ripped open all the time? It's all the fucking time. You can speak free with me. Both of you can. I've had more queens stop here than the coronation. You know, when I was a kid, next door's budgie escaped from its cage. Go away birdie! Go away, Birdie! God. It kills me. Those children. A blessing and a gift. Their lives are filled with innocence, joy, and laughter. Jesus actually tells us to be like children and to come to him for trust, faith, but not you. You spawn of the devil. What a filthy creature. Get out. He did things. He hurt me, Tommy. He heard me. It's OK. Please don't. Don't touch me. Don't look at me. Keeping myself hidden so the neighbors wouldn't see the marks and the cuts and the bruises. I heard it. The bird went the window. The flashy tail feathers, and then he heard him. The magpies. First one, then another. This savage, savage pecking. I just wanted to scream out loud, see. Boys don't scream. Men, real men, don't cry and make a fuss (VOICEOVER) No, Dad. No, Dad. Go away, birdie. No, Dad. I was six, you bastard. Six. Still in short trousers, I didn't need a thrashing. What had I done? Tell me what I had done that was so wrong. And every Sunday after chapel for years he whispered. He whispered, "I will beat the queer in you away." Tommy, there's something need to tell you, mate. I was arrested. The reason I was late for the bus. What are you talking about? Tommy, I'm so sorry. Oh, lad. Have pot of tea. And don't worry about that lamp. It was a wedding present. I've always hated it. It'll be in the paper. Me name, they'll put that in the fucking paper. Jesus, Eddy. So you see, we have to go. We have to leave. We-- Tommy, we have to go. I've got money I keep here in my socks. Look. Go where? America. America? Anywhere. But not home. Tommy, that place will never be home to me again. You know that. People don't go to America. They do. No, they don't. You said you loved me. I do. You know it. You said we were special. You said it was a fucking miracle that we found each other. And I believed you. Like a fucking fool, I believed you. They do. We can. We have to. Not me. Not if you want lads in that way. [interposing voices] It has to mean something. Busted. You turned my world upside down. You shake everything up. You asked me to hurt my family, my mama. They'll never let us be. They'll never let us be. Touch me. Touch me. It means-- it means the world. I would die for you. I'm glad. Tommy. Look, your mom and your dad, they know who we are. They know. They know. And you see the sky falling in-- You're a fucking liar! No. How can they? I've been so careful. Been so fucking careful. And they know. They know. But I won't pretend, not anymore. Don't you feel it, just like burning heat, this anger. How dare they? How fucking dare they? No Tommy, look at me. I will never again feel frightened and helpless, scared shitless, looking at all the old fashioned faces in those cars. I'll never again feel blood in my mouth, my own blood where some busted copper took a swing simply because he knows he can. No. So you choose. You choose, Tommy. I have loved you all the days of my life, so you choose. You fucking choose. But I will not go back to that time. I will not marry to conform. Shh, shh, shh. Get off! How could I be that cruel? How could I destroy another person's life because I was too scared to be truthful myself? No. No, I will fight. Tommy, I will fight. I will fight them. I'll fight them. That man downstairs, Tommy, he's working up the courage to do the bravest fucking thing I ever heard. And I'll tell you, I'm going to it that man by the hand and I'm going to walk with him-- Her-- along that promenade. Let them stare. But if one hand is raised again-- Phyllis? Phyllis, come here. You look right bonny tonight. You don't have to. No, you do. Dear, you do. You look lovely. You all do. It's OK. It's OK, just trust me. We're going on this walk. I'm leaving with Stanley. We're going to Gretna Green to the chapel. We're getting married. Stanley? Who's Stanley when he's a Tom? Oh, fool you. You can go and ruin your life tomorrow. Tonight, you're part of this. We're all going and that includes you. I'm not going to waste this wash and set. How bloody marvelous. Maureen, go and fetch me best hat. All of us, here tonight in Blackpool. What's all the commotion, Gladys? What's to do? We're walking with Phyllis. And don't she look lovely? And see this handsome booger here? Queer as they come. So you, Brenda, can kiss my spotty ass. With knobs on. [coughing] He's gone, my darling. He's gone. He's at peace. Well done, lad. Well done. You bloody queer! Get off my pier. Do that again and I'll kick the fucking shit out of you. Bloody freaks. Come back when your balls have dropped, you silly little man. Clear off! We did it. We did it, Tommy lad. We did it, lad. Remember? Out and proud. North to South Pier. [sobbing] We did it, lad. We did it. We did it. We did it. Look at us. Look at us, fighting back. Laws can be changed. One voice becomes another, then another. I will fight. I will fight them. From tonight, I'll bloody take them all up, tooth and nail, for our rights, signed on the equal ground as everyone else, because no one is going to tell me that how I love Tommy Price is less valid. Nobody, ever, ever again. Eddy, wait! I love you so fucking much. [music playing] (SINGING) I close my eyes. I count a moment to pass on by, a silent whisper, a sacred cry, dreaming to tell that feeling goodbye. In the world full of papers, Columns of numbers, daily small town routines. In the life played upon a stage.
