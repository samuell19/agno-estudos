Look Haru, there's water. Can you see it? That's amazing. Ah, I'm coming! Welcome-- Not quite right, but "welcome home" isn't quite right either. I guess "come in" fits. I'm somehow nervous. Keep your shoes on, come in. Wait.. Isn't this too amazing? How is it? Isn't it pretty great? This is what you call an investment! Firstly, let's make you the custodian, Naomi. Tells us if you find anything troublesome. Uncle Masahiro, Asuko-san.. Please take care of me. Stop it, how embarrassing! It's my first time being called Uncle Masahiro.. Oh well, it's a good thing. It's all thanks to my brother. Just call him Maa-kun, okay? By the way, where's Haru? Ah, right here. Woah, such things exist? Hold on.. Ah, Haru! Ah, by the way... I accidentally opened it. It somehow made the air feel heavier, my bad. That's no problem, thanks. He's been putting in and putting out things since earlier, so he got flustered. Once again, you must be tired after the cremation process. It really was hard, right? We would've done it together if not for his work. No problem, I was mostly just sitting there and listening to the sutras. This altar gave me a bit of trouble. I wanted to at least have them enjoy the high-rise life in Tokyo. "Enjoy"? He moved the altar a lot since he was uncertain on where to put it. Brother, sister, here's Tokyo. Alright, let's do this in place of the 40th day ceremony. What about their portraits? I left it, they looked like they wanted to stay behind instead. Really? You're right. To him, it was the house he's lived in since birth after all. By the way, do as you wish with this place, Naomi. But, is it really okay? You mean living here? Of course. If it suits you, naturally. If you need something or need help, feel free to tell us about it. We live in the 41st floor, by the way. Okay. Uncle Masahiro-- "Maa-kun!" Maa-kun, you definitely must let me pay rent at least. Naomi, this is an investment, it's part of the business. In the first place, I'm in a position where I have to give you money monthly. Because I'm responsible for you. Yep, you're free to leave if you get sick of this place. - Maa-kun, wait a moment. - Okay. Haru? It's like I'm living in the skies. Good morning. Good morning. Ah, welcome back, it must've been hard. I'm sorry for causing you all trouble! Ah, souvenirs! Sorry.. Woah, your hair! Welcome back! Are you doing okay? I'm completely fine! I've compiled your homework here. Thanks. Chief, I'm back. Welcome back, Kobayakawa-san. It was hard on you, wasn't it? No, I'm sorry for causing you worry. Did the cremation go well? Yes. I see, that's good to hear. Let's talk again sometime soon. Where's Kashiwagi-san? Ah, okay. He's been at it since 2 AM last night... reading the 1200 sheets Yoshida-san gave him. He's locked himself in that study for at least 8 hours now. He could be done now. No, I think he could be asleep. Oh, you're here. Could anyone order takeout? I'll be fine with curry. Okay. Kashiwagi-san, I'm back. I must've worried you. Ah, welcome back, Kobayakawa-san. Let's do this after... I'll be finished soon. I might collapse if I don't eat something soon. What will you be having, Naomi-san? Ah, I'll go with chicken kishimen. Right, chicken kishimen... Kashiwagi-san looks beat. He's still disputing on whether to write it anew or to serialize it. Yoshida-san wants the former. But the chief wanted to do the latter since the end of spring, and they're still at it. What do you want to do as the person-in-charge, Aiko? It's a matter for the editor-in-chief at this point. A monthly issue and a tankobon would both be impossible for Kashiwagi-san. I have to agree. I have no objections regarding him wanting to make a new novel after the award. This is more on convincing the chief. I'll say this as someone who was in charge of him. Pushing Yoshida Osamu's name further than the literature world... I think that is something that we must do. Even as I say so, I'm uncertain as to whether our company can achieve that. A bet, is it not? Yes. What about you, Aiko? Rather than my viewpoint, I think something else is a bigger matter to me. Could you please make me the person-in-charge again? As an editor, I feel confident and am responsible... to help Yoshida-san write an award winning piece. Though I may have been exaggerating. As for the planning of this new piece... I will definitely be working with Kinoshita for that. I will definitely think about that. But to you, Kobayakawa-san... I think you must first focus on your return to work. But this is quite interesting.. To think that someone who lost her parents, and one who will be going through a shotgun wedding is sitting in front of me now. Kashiwagi-san, I think you're crossing the line with that statement towards Naomi-senpai. Ah, my apologies. But please think about it. Isn't this world of ours interesting? Is this what literature is? Well, you can call it literature or novels. Yoshida-sensei must have no regrets pursuing such amazing things. But you see, writing a novel after winning an award... it's hard, regardless of your skills. Factors such as anticipation, jealousy, or impatience, for example. That's why... I've been wondering if I should tell him to take it easy or not. That's why I wish to support him. This won't only be Yoshida-san's problem-- Yoshida-sensei is here. Yes, come in. I've read it. Frankly, we're currently unable to decide... what to do with such an exquisite piece of work. The chief has already conveyed his inclination a few days back. I regret to say this after making you finish the manuscript last night... and on top of that, having you visit when you're currently feeling this way. We merely wish to state our viewpoint. You're the only one who read this manuscript, right? Yes, as of now. But the two-- I understand. I understand, and so I'll brashly say this... If we cannot go with the plan of writing it anew... then I must instead go to another publisher. Understood. I will attempt to convince the chief. I will make sure to say that you have confidence in your manuscript at least. And that is why, let us go with what you planned to do. However.. Whether or not this sells well... please write at a similar quality for our company next time and onwards. That is a condition. Kobayakawa-san. Yes? Do you have any plans to sell it? Pardon? It's the chief's condition. Even if a young publisher like us were to publish his book... it would still be most regrettable for Yoshida-san. That's why, somehow.. though it may seem cruel of me to say... could you take over my burdens and find something that can convince the chief? Then, what you said just now was..? That was merely lip service. When Yoshida-san said he would do either... I thought of doing a serialization... since I thought that it would be a better direction for Yoshida-san to take. We can publish it without much editing at some degree of quality. But writing anew means that Yoshida-san won't earn money the next time. It doesn't seem likely that he can write something to surpass one work so soon. If it doesn't sell well, then we'd be stuck in a stalemate. What will you do? I'll get married. Is that so? It's been long. Yes. Way too long. I'VE FED HARU. - ASUKO Haru. Haru.. Support me, okay? Good morning. I'm going up, though. Ah, pardon me. Eh? Why are you apologizing? Ah, you're right. Excuse me? Since it's an occasion, I'll send you down. Such things really do exist, huh? Things like atmospheric pressure. Though it's quite uncommon, have you never swallowed spit before? Everyone! What do you think about Tokito Morinori? He's quite my type. I'm not too interested. He's quite erotic, isn't he? Our Kami-san is a fan. Doesn't he feel like he's created for the century? He's great at dramas. Good morning. (Everyone) Good morning! What happened? Did it go well? Thanks to you. Glad to hear that. Thanks. What do you think about Tokito Morinori? How unexpected! I never knew you had such interests. No! It's just that, umm.. “Wild with the wind”! Right! He's in that ad! I can see a billboard with him from the apartment I moved to. Ah, he's been quite famous lately. My friend was chasing him in quite the while back... and she said that his qualities was not from his face, but his inner self. I asked, "Is he a good young man"? He does feel like that somehow. Oh, you're being fooled. It's just his outer image. He's probably a jerk in actuality. Which is it? And now, Naomi's welcoming part-- No need for that! Isn't it okay? Let me say something. No, let's have a cheers first, okay? Okay. Cheers! What's wrong? Is it dirty? No, I was checking if it was broken somewhere. If it broke, we can just replace it with one from our room. You're quite sensitive, similar to how my brother was. I was yelled at for breaking a plate that looked quite expensive when I was little. "Naomi, you're really no good!" he said. My brother did? Yeah. He really had a short temper. But, Maa-kun, didn't you say that? That Naoto-san praised Naomi. Really? Remember? Naoto-san said that after getting drunk after our ceremony. We were both quite drunk back then. You're so unreliable! Was that it? "Naomi is someone similar to a spider." He said. That's it! Is that supposed to be a compliment? It was! Right, Asuko? It came from the man's brother's mouth, so it must be true! "Someone similar to spiders"? If you sigh, happiness will run away from you. I'm already happy enough, let me sigh. What's wrong? I can't bear being someone who's like a spider. I want to disappear. Naomi, do you want to try for a marriage interview? If you're feeling like it, go look for a partner. Men have lots of work, too. Because they're spiders. No, what I meant was... "Kumo" as in the kanji meaning clouds in the skies. What? Haru~ You got it wrong, didn't you? Good day. What a coincidence, even with the bouquet. Ah, you're right. Do you like it? I dislike withering flowers, so I buy new ones to put in the vase before they wither. That's simply it, I buy it for my own sake. So it won't end then, huh? I guess. Take these too and put them in. I don't have a vase anyway. I get them a lot but end up throwing them away. Excuse me, now. Hey. Can you make omelette rice? I can. Right now? Well, I've wanted it since earlier. I guess it's impossible. Well, no... it's not impossible. Really? Wait, you mean at my apartment? I guess you wouldn't want me entering. Umm.. I'll handle the flowers first. Ah, of course. This is weird, isn't it? Are these your parents? Yes, they died of a traffic accident. When? Last week was the 40th day since their death. Recently, then. I'll make it soon. You're used to it. It's not that big of a deal.. I have no chicken meat, so may I substitute ham instead? I'm completely okay with that. I'm digging in. Yep, this is delicious. Do you plan on standing there until I finish eating? Ah, I'm sorry, I lost the timing to sit down. It's filled with cardboard boxes, huh? Yes, I had no time to clean them up. Due to work? I still haven't been able to properly return to work. I'm quite anxious. You're somehow... like a professional athlete? Quite close, but... though the moon is closer than Mars is. What's that mean? I work at a publishing house, do you understand what editors do? I know, they do interviews... they're also someone who waits on the people getting interviewed. Yes, that is indeed one of our duties. Don't you know me? Y-yes, I do. You're the man from that billboard. Sorry, that came out quite unnaturally. Yes, you're Tokito Morinori-san, right? I'm sorry, I'm quite nervous. Do you make magazines and the sorts? I'm responsible for literature related things, tankobons, and novels as well. And someone like Murakami Haruki? Ahaha, we're back to Mars. Umm, what? We're quite the small publishing house located in the countryside. Ah, I say "countryside"... but it doesn't take more than an hour to commute to work. But it's still in the countryside regardless. Our chief decided that we would never make bad books. He's quite eccentric, but overall a very interesting chief. Thanks for the food, it was really good. A cat's? Haru's scared of strangers, and so won't show up except if it's a family member. Hey. Tell me your phone number, I'm not fond of communicating through mail. Put it in. Okay. It was really delicious, thanks. I also have no parents. No way. Sorry that I can't help. No, it's really okay. It's impossible, books and novels are definitely not for him. I can't deny that statement. Yeah, it's impossible for you. Authors really are amazing, it's unbelievable. Sorry to say, but they tell quite a lot of lies, don't they? What's that supposed to mean? Call it a fabrication instead, call it fabrication or call it fiction. Yeah, fiction. They do really well to make things over and over. Naomi, do you really not have a boyfriend? No, I don't. Editor Kobayakawa Naomi must be living in the fictional world. That's not true. I agree, come back to reality! As I said, I have none. I haven't met someone. You haven't? That's why they made places for marriage interviews. Well, just how do I put it? How about you date an author? That's fiction as well. Nope, it's actually realistic. But disgustingly realistic. Aren't in company romances decreasing right now? True. Then what's your type? My type? I haven't been thinking about it. In the past there was that poster pasted on the study. One of David Bowie. Isn't that a foreigner? Well, probably not foreigners. Then Japanese people are okay? What about him? Tokito Morinori. What?! Who's that? Can't you see it from our room? That handsome man on the billboard. What? That's also fiction. It's not. We're talking about Naomi's type. Looks like you caught a cold. I guess, I went to somewhere cold today. Take care of yourself. You're eating well. I think I like this already. All day, it feels like I've been commanded to eat a lot. It's like my body's been taken over. It's similar to those "Body Snatchers". My weight right now is bad, I only have around a month left before the ceremony. If I can't fit in a dress then I won't look good. I think you'll be a great mother, Aiko. It suits you more, in my opinion. You're good at cooking. I'm not confident in it. You're being negative again. Let's all be positive, okay? I can't do it like you do. You do know about it, right, Naomi-senpai? What? That she's Yoshida-san's baby. I guess. I knew it! I thought it would've been obvious to you. What about your fiance? I don't know. What should I do, will he find out? I guess it's whatever, huh? I don't think such a carefree person exists. They do exist! He's fine with only having me. He's quite the nice guy. But it's just... it's just quite marvelous, you know? But to me, giving birth to a child whose father is married with children... is just kind of heads or tails. It really is indeed. Naomi-san, did you move into Le Soleil? Ah, yeah. Why didn't you tell me?! Is it famous? Didn't you know? It's appeared on TV and magazines! It was one of the 100 high class apartments in Tokyo that was featured. I've been there for the occasion of data collection, and it has a great view! Right? Yes, more or less. Naomi-san, are you a celebrity? There's no way! People living there are celebrities. My uncle owns it, not me. Ah, is that so? But even so, aren't you incredibly lucky? Lucky indeed. Firstly, we should party! Good idea! Think about it, Naomi-chan just lost her parents.. Sorry about that. It doesn't matter who owned it, what matters is that you own it now. Well, every woman is like that, huh? That's why, I'm okay with Naomi-senpai as she is now. I think I have a fever.. Oh my, is it no good? Ugh, I guess Haru hates me. If you leave Haru alone, Haru will get closer to you in time. Leave Haru alone, huh? I guess Haru doesn't like someone who's too eager to help like me. Wait, what happened to the altar? Ah, I put it in the closet. Isn't it better to put it somewhere you can see it? Yeah, but somehow.. When will Maa-kun be back? In a week or so, but I have nothing to do now that I'm alone. Mom would say that often. Being a housewife is lonely. Are you lonely too, Asuko-san? Where I currently am, somehow... in a sense, it's over. Stop that. When I was a flight attendant, it was the aftermath of the bubble. I could play around as I wished, and so I did just that. I'm seriously jealous. When it ended, it really did. Emptiness.. It was emptiness, it was really empty, there was absolutely nothing. But on the contrary, there were some comfortable good times. I understand and don't understand. In the first place, I have 2 sisters. The older two, since they were kids... had such a bad relationship to the point it was surprising. They would have big fights every single day. My father was absent, and mom would have to mediate the fights between the two a whole lot... I guess it was loneliness, or not... basically, I just wanted to get away from there. Then it went, "When I realized, I was alone." That's a carefree life for you. Siblings, huh? I understood the siblings part less than the flight attendant part.. Was it lonely being an only child? I guess it wouldn't be classified as being lonely.. I just can't understand siblinghood. Thanks, sorry for this. You're a strong girl, Naomi. You didn't even cry on the funeral. Were you surprised? Yeah, a bit. - Asuko-san, I.. - Yeah? It's not that I didn't cry, it's that I couldn't cry. You couldn't? I really don't understand... I don't know why I'm like this. I just couldn't cry. The tears wouldn't come out. I haven't cried even now. I guess I must be someone cold. That's not true. You're not a cold peerson. Look at Haru. Animals won't be relying on such a cold human. You're right. There are people like that. No matter how sad things are... and even if it's incredibly sad, they just can't cry. Hmmm, I just don't know if I was sad or not. You shouldn't think like that! Yeah, I guess. I'll stop thinking like that. Don't tell Maa-kun about this. It's okay, I won't. I doubt he'd understand even if I did. I see, thanks. Hello? It's me. Yes? Do you know of "Satou Nishiki"? - Those are cherries, right? - Correct. High class ones from Yamagata. About that, I have some which I doubt I can finish, do you want to eat it? Yes. Okay. I'm coming over right now. Right now? Hey. Do you call this the stem? It's actually the stalk. "Stalk"? Ah, so that's it. Can you tie the stalk in your mouth? People who can do it are said to be good at kissing. I can't do it, though. You know about this, then? Can you do it? But I don't want to. Thanks. Oh, are you challenging yourself? I can't do it. Here. Somehow... it's like diving your head into the pool in the middle of a downpour. Why..? You looked like you wanted a kiss. I don't think my face looked like that. Do you not want to? I'll stop if you don't want to. Ouch. That's no good. Haru, don't come! You can't! You can't! Go over there. Hey. You look like you did something bad. Really? See, it's that face? Is it really okay? Shall I stop? Do I get to decide? Yes. I'm fine with anything. With anything? I was the one asking. The crossroads of life.. Should I stop? Or should I continue? Don't stop. Haru, look here! Look here! - I finally get to hug Haru! - One more shot! It's nice huh, Haru? - Oh! - How was it? Look, you had the face of a mother. I guess I have the knack for motherhood! Asuko, you're good at anything. Really? I uploaded it to Instagram. Wait, don't upload it one-by-one! What's so bad about showing off your beautiful wife? Fine, fine. Asuko, you seem like you'll be overprotective. Eh, I don't want to be like that. You'll only let them eat one type of food while disallowing others... and when you're hugged, you don't want to let go. That's nice. What's this? Do you want to be shackled? My mother was the complete opposite. Fuyiko-san must be quite lonely because of my brother. She wasn't interested in me either. Aren't you quite the independent spirit thanks to that? I'd be okay with raising a child who's like Naomi. We haven't even been blessed with a child yet. Well, we're talking about someday. It'd be amazing if you even managed to have a child. You should sign up for Instagram too. Ah, I don't like doing such things. Just give me your phone for a moment. Okay. It's interesting that people can get connected through photos. Photos are more eloquent than words, no? And you can see a different side to the people you know. I work in book publication, by the way. Publishers put out photo albums, don't they? Records, they are all momentary. What was that? Just dad's way of speaking. Maa-kun, what should we have for dinner? Let's have some Japanese food, it's been a while. Naomi, do you want anything? Sorry, but I have plans today. Oh my, is it with a boy? Hey! But you've been going out a lot lately. No way, I'm just busy because of work. What do you want? I'll go with sushi. Okay then. That billboard is no good. It's like a surfboard without a rider floating in the rotten sea. I'm sure there are people who don't think that way. But isn't it wrong? It feels more alive when it's right there. It's because I'm living as well. I'm talking about its liveliness. The Tokito-kun who's there and the Tokito-kun who's here... they're simply incomparable. I guess the one right here is empty as well. That's for the people who see to decide. You can't say that people won't notice you being there... if you're walking beside them as they look at the billboard. Somehow.. You speak in an interesting manner sometimes. It's really not. You're completely in sight, yet you've prepared a different answer once asked. What do you mean by that? The contents are straightforward... yet the expression is twisted and complicated. Yes, certainly. People say that a lot about me. Your emotions and your exterior self aren't consistent, right? What do you mean? What? Something like this. But you're a professional, it's not like I'm trying to act in a certain way. You see, in acting... it's about how much truth you can create within those lies. It's like you're doing the opposite. You know what the truth is, yet you end up lying. Was that why I couldn't cry? What? Nevermind. I just thought about how I wanted to cry like that. To simplify, you can compare it to the möbius strip. Hey, do you want to make a book with me? What, a book? You mean like those "celebrity written books" thing? No way. No, it's a book about your philosophies. Ehh, you must be happy. Happy to be using me like that. I'm not going to use you. I'm more than happy to be used. I'll say this, but it's not a feeling of love or affection. It's simply to fill the void in my heart, doing things like being together... or maybe sleeping together. I think that such things are completely different. Isn't that how human relationship works? But you see... once a person establishes a relationship with the other... it will continue to the end of your life, and it can feel like hell. You can try to forget, but in the end, it won't end it. Saying that you forgot means that you're just lying. That's why... when you can use someone, use them. Then let them do the same. Oppositely, this is called "being useful". It's because I've been taught... to live in a way that I'm useful to others. I'm okay with being useless to others. But I want to be useful to others, in a matter of ways. Do you get me? I guess. But... I guess I'm happy. It'll sell, I'm sure of it. It's okay. Woah, isn't this amazing? This is too beautiful! I'd definitely want to capitalize this view for myself! Woah, that's really Shinjuku over there! Look at it everyday and you'll get sick of it. That's a line only the owner would say. It's quite disagreeable. Is black tea okay? Ah, sure! Woah, this feeling of sitting down is amazing! This is definitely expensive! Where was this made? Ah, I don't know. It's all things my uncle prepared for me. Such amazing uncles exist? I'll give birth here and raise my child here! You dummy. You have a lot of things that I don't, Aiko. - Here. - Thanks. Here. What I have are all fakes created by lies. Does your husband or anyone else think that you're a bad person? That is why I can't get found out. But there's a chance that you could get found out. People who hurt others are often incomplete themselves. That's really impossible. When we do something, we have to finish it. Then, you don't want to get found out, right? Well nope, this baby... I've been telling everyone that it's her 8th month... but it's really not. It won't be unusual if I give birth to her this month. But if you give birth.. I'll prepare a diversion. I even had the doctor I've been seeing so far fooled. I've come this far, there's nothing left to do but finish it. You see, I doubt you actually had them fooled. It was my dream to create a family. With me there, with a father there... and my child there as well. Just a normal and happy family. Aiko, you're quite the complicated person. You must be speechless and think that I'm quite the sketchy person... but no, my family is actually very normal, though my father may have been a gang member. But you're quite feminine. That's actually normal, I'm just doing what I can. What? What you can? If you do what you can, doesn't that mean that you're moving forward? Whether it may be a bad choice or a correct one... it's okay as long as you keep going forward. Well, I guess I may be making more enemies along the way. Aiko.. I'll be your ally no matter what. Umm.. Please stop doing that. Are you sure you don't want a taxi? I'll be okay, the station isn't that far. Good day. That was Tokito Morinori, right? Yes, I think he lives here. Ah, I guess that was why you brought him up. Well, I guess. Why didn't you tell me? It's not something for me to be spreading around. Eeh, really? That girl just now, she was pregnant, wasn't she? Yeah. Big bellies are weird, huh? But everyone was born from a mother. That's why it's weird. Naomi, I have some dry cured ham from Italy! I'll come inside! Naomi, are you not home? What was that? My uncle lives here with his wife, that was my aunt. Does she have a key to your room? How troublesome. I'm sorry. I'm turned off in a sense. I'll make you omelette rice. I hate eggs. What do you mean? It was heartbreak! Tokito Morinori had a girlfriend, right? Are you still talking about that? Think for a moment! Our deadline's today! It's the heartbreak of the century! Just what are you saying? Geez. Not falling in love is more unusual! Especially for a handsome guy like him. I wonder if he'll get a wife? Good morning! (Everyone) Good morning. Aiko, did you know about that Tokito Morinori thing? Ah, a friend was being rowdy on Twitter. Alright! Naomi-senpai, is your apartment doing okay? Stop! What's this? What business does Naomi-san have with him? They both live in the same apartment complex! A lot of famous people live there. Then, you've seen the real thing?! Well, I guess.. His aura was amazing, right, Naomi-senpai? Wait, have you been there yourself, Aiko? What?! You cheater! It was the best! I even begged my husband to move. Geez, you really can't be helped. Kinoshita, you look like you'll flee before the ceremony. I'll be okay! I'll keep it going for roughly a week. Once you go through the ceremony, it won't exactly end there. Yes, more like it starts from there. Listen up, if you talk about only the hard things, then happiness will run from you. I'm digging in! This is delicious! Glad to hear that. Do you want cheese on top? Yes, please. Teach me how to cook next time, Naomi. I can't make anything too hard. I can't even do the simple things. Isn't Maa-kun okay with you despite? Yeah, I guess. If we're together, I'd be okay with us as we are. It's because I want kids. It's something I can do, so I'll put in the effort. I'll be here for you anytime just in case you need me. Well, I guess it's impossible for me. I'll probably keep it a secret from Maa-kun. What secret? Me wanting kids. Somehow... I feel at ease when I think about how I don't actually need them. I see. It's a problem of fate, whether that door will burst open or not. So you should get married and have kids. I'll be sure to spoil them. Okay? I wonder? What will you do? You don't know, right? - Hey, Asuko-san. - Yeah? You talked about Tokito Morinori the other day, right? Ah. He lives here, do you know that? Ah, you know about that, huh? He stands out, that kid doesn't even try to hide his face. And somehow, he'd be with different girls all the time. What? He's young, handsome, and makes bank... I guess he can't help it. He goes through that cycle quite quickly. Kids like him don't think of women as people. He controls them, then when he's sick of them, that's that. He's an enemy of women. You be careful too, Naomi. What's wrong? I have to feed Haru. Haru, your food's ready. Haru? Haru? What's wrong? There's a chance that Haru has a troublesome disease. I'll draw blood and perform the necessary tests first and foremost. A troublesome disease? Naomi, he's talking about a possibility. Isn't that so? Indeed. I can't say anything at this stage. Firstly, let's wait for the results. I leave it in your capable hands. Haru-chan has lymphoma. It's quite the frightening disease. The cause isn't clear. Stress could be a factor to causing it. Did Haru-chan exhibit any sudden changes lately? I recently moved. This spring, I moved to a high rise apartment. A high rise apartment? What floor do you reside in? The 39th. A lot of people have been coming to my home lately. Haru's afraid of people, and so would hide somewhere when someone came. I'd say that it's a great change in environment. I see. But I'm really uncertain as to the cause of it right now. Please don't fret too much over this. The hard times starts now. We don't know when and how it'll progress. I see. Haru-chan is quite calm. It's rare to see a cat with this much perseverance. I guess Haru's similar to you. You're wrong. What? I'm not the type to persevere. This summer, the movie "Timely" will be shown in theaters. The protagonist will support their lover who had lost their memory. We'd like to welcome Tokito Morinori, who plays as the character Fujioka Kaito. I'd like to thank you all for letting me be here today. Sekiguchi-san. This will be a project I will remember. Please enjoy it to the end. Thank you. There's been a report in the weekly magazines about your passionate love. What kind of relationship do you have with her? Please keep the questions related to the movie. It's okay, she's merely a drinking partner. It's mostly older women, are there any charms to them? Good evening. Good evening. Kobayakawa-sama. Yes? Are you used to the elevator? Yes. Well, I'm quite used to it. Doing anything needs time. Indeed. Being responsible for an apartment building... this is my 3rd time doing so. There are strengths and weaknesses to each of these buildings. But the people who live here are quite happy. Everyone looks happy. They look happy? Everyone never stops smiling, the saying "home is where you make it" is indeed true. It'd be nice if it's like that. Excuse me. Can we talk again soonn My deepest apologies, but this will be my last week here. Is that so? The person replacing me will surely be a great person as well. Haru, food's ready. Haru, you have to eat. Naomi, are you home? Reply to me if you're there. Why..? Oh my, what a nice dress. Why did you come in? A marriage ceremony? I go to where I want to. Where did you go? What are you doing leaving Haru behind like this? It's none of your business. That's not true. I'm family to you and Haru, so it is my business. You're not my family. Naomi. Just what is family? What will you say if we're family? These are all just creations. Naomi.. Did you cry for Haru's sake? So what if I didn't cry? Can you prove that I cried, even if I did cry? Haru? When's the next visit? Get out! I understand the situation, so just get out! I'm begging you, just leave me alone. Okay. I'm sorry for bothering you. Please let me consult with you once you're back from your holiday. Excuse me. The weather's nice, huh? Just like that day. The day we first met. The winds were strong, and it was really cold. I.. I wanted my parents to worry about me. Dad was busy with work, and mom was busy thinking about dad all the time. I wanted to be cared for. That's why I thought to get a cold. I thought that they'd worry about me if I had a cold and got a fever. Now that I think about it, I feel like an idiot. But I really thought that. Then I want to the sea alone. You were crying with such a loud voice. You went "Byaa! Byaa!" You were small, but you were able to cry out loudly. I thought that was amazing. You loved me, yet you can't convey it to me. Your entire body was telling me that you wanted to live. Ever since I met you. I became okay. Haru.. Haru.. I'm sorry for leaving you alone. I'm sorry. I couldn't be there for you.. I'm sorry. Haru.. You were me. I don't need anything anymore. Ah, good work. Good luck. I leave it to you! Yoshida-sensei, we leave it to you. Can I begin with that favor I asked of you? A tell all book? A book about your philosophies. I have none of what you speak. Even if you don't have them, you see the world in your own way. Then feel free, I'm okay with it if it's you. Once this is over, we're both over as well. Tokito-san, what is your favorite color? You wanna start with that? Then let's warm up. Beige. The color of someone's skin, and the color of the clouds before it's dyed by the evening sun. Do you not like the evening sun? Yes. But it's certainly better than morning. In any way, dichotomy is a bit too cliched. Just like women and men? When melted, they become one to me. Aren't you lumping everyone together? I'm fine with that. It's better that way. Are you bored? On the contrary, this is my first time doing such a thing. What do you mean by "doing such a thing"? Seriously thinking about my answers. Ah, it's not because this will get published, though. How do I put it, I'm not trying to suck up to anyone right now. Do you usually do that? Yes, though I look like this. Though nobody's realized. I suck up to them, but not to the point they realize I'm sucking up to them. Why? It makes me feel at ease. Isn't it sad to be thought of as a suck up? The grasslands do not care. (?) What about animals? Do you hate them? How could I? I like them. But you don't own one. It's because I like them. It'd be a waste if I owned a pet at this current point of my life. Do you want one to the point it becomes unbearable? Maybe one day. I might live with a lot of dogs and cats. Yeah, maybe. Hey. Dogs and cats are better.. That came out wrong.. It's better to be a dog or a cat rather than to be human. Your time is shorter. I guess it's 15 years from being a baby cat to an adult. After that, it's all just happy memories. But human relationships lasts until you're dead. I guess that can be a sort of personal hell. We have to be associated with each other for such an unbearable amount of time. But that's just how we are. There will be boring things if there are good things, and it may feel like hell... just thinking about it gives me goosebumps. Thinking that it will end is naive. But there's nothing to do but to bear it. That's why a lot of things aren't such a big deal. Hey, how old is your cat? We've been together for 15 years. How is your relationship with your parents? Normal, just the typical salaryman family. How about your siblings? Do you have a sister? Yes, she's such a kind and intellectual sister. Why did you become an actor? I was accompanying a friend to an audition. Did you think you would pass? Ah. The wind blew, that's what I understood. This is the last question. Tokito-san... what are your dreams? I still haven't... stood on the surface. I still haven't stood on the surface with my two feet. It's over, Haru. The smokes aren't coming out, huh? What? Ah, indeed. It disappeared without turning into smoke. I wonder if it did? What? It's not an issue with time or distance. For example, it's like being a star. Well, it's normal, but on an off chance, it could turn out like that. I guess that's true. This might be weird to hear.. Us humans... we all live like parallel lines that will never cross one another. Yes. Those parallel lines... will never meet on the bare earth. But... if it were to keep going farther into space... it will intersect one day. It's a story from someone I know. Thank you. No problem. Where's Kashiwagi-san? He's in the study. You really are serious? Yes. This may be rude, but there is something I must ask you. Are you related to this Tokito person? Yes. Ah, is that so? Which is why I have the confidence to pull it of. This genre... it's not an area of my expertise, and so I can't give you my proper judgement. But contrary to my expectations... What I mean is... think of it simply as a case. If this turns out to be an excuse to help the currently scandal ridden Tokito Morinori.. People will read it. I'm not sure if this will help him, and I'm not sure either if this will simply turn out as him making an excuse to society. After all, he hasn't regretted his actions. I'm sure he's still living in a nonchalant manner. But that's why... I think this is a job for my sake rather than for his sake. Only that is certain. Kobayakawa-san. People wish to know the truth. If people think it's telling the truth, then they'll pick it up. Yes. As long as there's the truth, then it'll be okay. I personally want Yoshida-san to pick this story up. You mean to say..? I'll deliver the interview and the manuscript to him, all of them. I want him to adapt it into a documentary. I wonder how it will turn out? However, if the truth you speak of is not present there... on my honor as an editor, I'll be sure to edit it until you're satisfied. If it's still no good despite, I'll take responsibility. Is this for the company's sake? Or is it for your personal sake? I'll say this boldly, but it's for Haru. I must do this for the sake of my deceased cat. I'm uncertain if this can make you understand my reasoning. I.. In some way, I have a soft spot for you. Aiko! I was so close... but it looks like my water broke. Your water broke?! We have to call an ambulance! Don't! I'll give birth right here! That's just impossible! I've made up my mind! It'll go well if I give birth here! Enough, we need to take you to the hospital! I told you that going to a hospital is no good! It's no good, I can't give birth like this! Aiko-chan, let's contact your family. No! It's impossible! I can't give birth now! If your husband won't like it, then perhaps your mother-- I told you, I'm not giving birth! It's impossible! It's definitely impossible! Even if it's impossible, you have to give birth! You have to tell your family! You liar! You told me you'd me on my side! I can't do this anymore.. I don't want to.. It's impossible! Don't cry, you bastard! If you made a decision, follow through till the end! You're scary and mean! Let's go to the hospital! It's okay, I'll be there for you. I know you can give birth! That's how life is. Give birth, okay? Firstly, I'll have Yoshida-san read the materials in the office. She's still not done, right? Your husband seemed to be shocked but happy when he left. Ah. I'm such a horrible human being. I agree. So you agree.. Isn't it okay to be a horrible human being? That's not true. Why? There's a woman who didn't cry at her parents' funeral here. I don't know why I didn't, the tears wouldn't come out. Isn't that low? That's a different case. It's the same. We have to keep on living. Continue living, Aiko. I'm all talk. It's okay, everyone's like that. That's how human relationships are. No matter how horrible you think you are... to your child... you will always be her mother. Until the day you die. You'll have to persevere. It's a long journey ahead. You can't run away anymore, though. You're strong, Naomi-senpai. You're soft, gentle... and big. You can continue moving forward. You're unbeatable. really? The baby is a girl. Matsunaga finally opened his mouth. Welcome back. In the end, life is but a medical experiment. Though it would not seem likely to one who has lost just about everything. It was a gentle voice. Especially the thing such as love, it is a new experimental drug. Your love for someone or something will deepen if it's already deep. Thanks to that, nobody will know what happens next. Excuse me, Tokito-san, you should bring out your passport now. She must be out. She might be out even this evening. She must have a boyfriend. She had one, but not anymore. What? Asuko, you knew?! I didn't, it was just a guess. Oh, really?
