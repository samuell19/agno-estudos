Let me help you. I have a son your age. Is there someone waiting for you? Yes, my uncle Juan. You wait here for your uncle, uh? And do not worry, he will come soon. Are you Manuel? Yes. Well now, whew... How was your trip? Ok. Do not you remember me? Uncle Juan, your Uncle Juan, my boy. How much you've grown, uh? What do you got here, son? What's wrong, baby? I want to go with my parents. Oh well, no big deal, Manuel, you will see how everything works out. You'll see. Come on, that's better. Is it true that you have been given a drawing prize at school? Yes. Blow your nose. The Cebri?ns have temperament of artists. "Who through life sighs asks: what is life? Life is suffering, grief, a torment that invites us to meditation." What do you think of the poem? Well, your father wrote it, when he was your age. Such an guy was grown your father. I want to go with my parents. Then we start well. Hello! Hello! Manu, you're wondering what do you do here in Murcia with your uncles. It is because my parents are getting divorced. Well, that matter we'll talk later, yeah? You'll see how things are getting out: following the instructions of your parents, you're going to spend three weeks here with your family in this house. You'll spend the first week with Uncle Juan, and Marisa, your aunt. And, of course, with your cousins. Sofia, Amalia, and Fuensanta. Hello! Then you'll spend another week with Fernando and Aunt Beatriz. They live in the first level flat and are the owners of the shop. And if it's any reference, I'll tell you that make sweets that taste great, the finest in Murcia. And the last week you will spend here with us. I am Loly. I am Emi. Well, all this if you think it fits. Because we're in a democracy, no? Margarita, Margarita, uh? Yes, yes. We thought it convenient, that rather than to go to a new school, with the implications that this entails, it is better that I give you classes to learn new subjects, and, above all, you do not forget what you have learned. Also trying, as far as possible, to visit some of the most remarkable monuments of this city, in order to increase your cultural heritage. Murcia is a beautiful city, which the River Segura, given the benefit of its water to create this beautiful garden where orchard and lemons and oranges... Margarita! ...grow handsomely. Antonico, son, where are you? Antonico! He speaks to you, play along. Son, who is it? Are you sick? Say something. I've been looking all over the house, and I have not found you. Where have you been? I was out there playing. Where, playing the birdie (pajarico)? What do I say? This is Manuel, Antonio's son, your grandchild. My grandson, grandson? He is the son of Antonio. Grandpa, your son Antonio married Teresa, remember? This child is your grandchild Manuel. And my son Antonico? Is he dead? No, Dad, he's not dead, your son Anthony lives in Madrid. My nephew Manuel, what do you think? He is handsomer than you. Have you seen such beauty? Greet. Hello! Well, keep working. Manu, you and I, we will work too. # In the garden of Murcia I bring a flower # # of which, my life, I make a love nest # Pelea, you have an ass such as to bit it a nibble. Already returns to its old ways? What shall we do, my daughter? Well, first lesson, Manu, write down: Maruja, come. Yes? Come for a little while. Come, come. I go. Do not go! Why wouldn't I go? Leave me alone. The most important thing is to take good measurements. if you're wrong you lose the customer and your self confidence. Write down: back: 33. back long: 40. Do not give yourself, Marujita Why not? I'm not at all like you, Celia. Bust: 85, beauty! Record it, son, write down. Hi, Dad! Hello! Good morning! She's beautiful! Let's see, what happens to my Fuensanta? But Fuensanta, you look like a princess! Such a nice dress! And the notebooks ... And this is for you. Thank you! Off! Well, here, place yourself where you want. Manu! Put your hat on, in these latitudes the sun is strong. "Neither the sun nor death, can you look ahead." # On the edge of the Segura # # when a farmer woman laughs # # glows with beauty # # all the Murcia shore # pay attention, Concentrate on what I say. Do you see? Look, that light! That light! The reeds and the river, can you see, which bisects the whole space, but most important are the colors. Look, Manu, look at the green trees is it not a wonder? Look, a magpie! It's a bird beautiful, though a little bad for the country. Remember me when I got home to show you a picture by Breguer I feel chills every time I see that picture Do you know why? No? Because it has mystery. The mystery, Manu, is a gift that only the enlightened ones have but today we will comply with stealing from nature one of their colors, is it true, child? Come on, do your thing! # In the garden of Murcia I bring a flower # # in which, my life, goes a love nest # # what happy I will be # # Lady of Fuensanta # # what happy I will be # # virgin in my heart # Fuensanta Fuensanta! Dad! We have visitors. We've done it! Good day! Artist? How are you, Sheriff? Have not you heard? I'm not sheriff anymore. Now I am God. Damn, and on Sunday? Have you changed your profession to improve it is a joke, do not get angry. Okay, okay, okay. Got anything to eat? Yeah, man. Give him an apple, Manu. Give it, give it. Let's see, You are an innocent child, tell me who I am? And shuld I know? You do not know who I am, girl? Do not know who I am? Is it possible? I'm God! Yes, yes, yes. I'm God! And how do you know? Would it will be enough one proof for you to believe? I can disappear anytime! Really? Then disappear and leave us alone. Not so, not so easy, right? You gotta have faith with faith, yeah. Faith moves mountains. Hey, you want me to disappear? Ok. Okay, do not bother us, get out of here. Wait, wait, wait. Okay, okay, I'll disappear. He doesn't disappear. Sheriff, Sheriff, man, have you died? Where am I? Who are you? He is well, yeah. Well, well, well. I'm here again. You've seen how I have gone? I told you. I disappear when I want because I am God, the Almighty. But you have not moved from there Above all, incredulous Ridiculous! I have returned! I'm already back here! I left, and I'm back, and here I am. Stay with God! Marking, marking! Now, pass it. Hey, the skirt, Gather! Listen, Manu! Look how wonderful! Something happens in this picture that makes it unique. The hunters, dogs, but the mystery is in the magpie, flying over the snowy mountains. Do you see? We remove the bird and it is another thing. It loses the mystery, Manu Fuensanta, turns on the light! You see, what's inside see the green tunic everything in this picture has double meaning like the mirror, for example, here it is. And here it is! This is for me the picture of pictures what a picture, my God! I'll give my life to paint such a picture In the life there are a few magical moments something happens that moves us, felt like an earthquake the trembling of the beauty in music in poetry, in a picture sometimes in a movie great artists, maybe they do not know, have the power to convey the magic the mystery of beauty the harmony of the words and things wonderful! Am I ok so? Turn a little a little more, woman there is nothing more beautiful than the female body and you have a great body, Martita. You have to have confidence in me I am an artist let me see your breasts, baby! Can' you see? I do not know how you hide something so beautiful. Those breasts have grown and developed to be cherished what else pretty things you say, Juan! It is a secret. What secrets? Well, women thingss. Whew. And you?

Yeah, you were scared, admit it! - Manu? - What? Do not get so, man, if I knew you so impressive, would not do not it, OK? Do not ever make it to me anymore! No. Sit down here beside me. Closer. This is my favorite place I come here to wonder - To wonder? Do not you wonder? Try it, close your eyes, and wonder. What do you see?

Everyone does his life Aunt Maggie says your father is a pennant. What is that? He is a gulf They were arguing and saying things what did they said? Did you spy them? No. Well, yes. One night, yeah. I could not sleep and went to their room. My mother said she had reached the limit of his strength and could not take it anymore What else? Do you promise not telling anyone? I promise. Promised, promised, promised. My mother told my father that he was disgusting is not it terrible? I only disgust roaches Come with me now I'll show you my secret Now be quiet I see nothing hush!

Nephew, take that chair and sit down You cease playing a couple of days and you lose the mechanism as I can not give you much time as you need so, nothing. A disaster. You are very demanding you want me to put my finger on the exact site nor 1 mm above or below and that takes hours and hours of work, son. Thousands of times you have to put my finger exactly micro metric and without reference, son and also there is the arc the exact pressure tilt due and stop at the right time not to extend a note and and destroy all the work done so far. The genius, baby, do not exist they are done by dint of working hours and submission. My teacher told me "Fernandico, you are much valuable, you have talent, and if you would, you could be a figure in the music scene" Yeah, he said That saying of the "music scene" he liked a lot, son "but you are lacking something important thing, you lack consistency, willpower, tenacity, wanting to be a star above all" He knew me well, because to me, baby, what I like in life, is wandering. In that respect I am Barogiano, I like to walk the roads of life and see what life reserves to me or gives me, and so on. etc. etc. You do it very well, uncle, I like it a lot. Thank you, nephew. Thanks to everybody thank you, dear audience what would the Philharmonic without me! Thank you, and you give up your ass! Fernando! Work claims for us, and evil money, son. The owner calls you Treat me with respect, Tony, and mostly in front of my nephew I need to talk to you See you later? Yes. The flesh is weak, beloved nephew, And you, what about you? Do you like girls? Well, it depends Yeah, of course, then take some advice, son be careful with women they have the wisdom and strength Did you called me? Man, you playing the guitar and Bethlehem with the shepherds as there is much to do ... Remember you have to make the wedding cake for the Enriquez? Ah, the Enriquez? "What became of so much elegance" What a head I have, son, I had completely forgotten a wedding cake with its doll and all from that we make a living, do not forget. Life is a wedding cake, child, "where do you go, child, through the woods I'll take the flowers of nature " No, I'm very inspired today, son my neurons are here between the cream and the Chantilly you've learned that of VAT? No. Well, very simple, baby, Always more. How dare you do that? You have no right. I do not know what happened, but it is so. I fell inlove with her I do not want to hurt you, Fernando, I have always been honest to you and me with you, Toni I know you'll suffer but I prefer your information by me and not for others But we can keep meeting We're getting married I'll kill myself!

I love you more than anything in the world Do not leave me, Toni please do not leave me!

You said you loved me that you would live forever with me We can not control feelings they are stronger than us they are stronger than all things you tell me that, do you remember? But we can keep meeting even if you go with that one No, Fernando, I will change my life! With Rosa I discovered that I like women I never felt so before my flesh burns when I touch her I dream on her body I like her voice look, when I... - Shut up! Do not humiliate me okay, go away without rancor? Go. Sorry. Go. I'm sorry, really. Auntie? Get in! Can I come in? Come in, come. Come in at once! What do you want? You have scissors?

Do you like my breasts? Look, man, they will not eat you! Come, come closer. Touch me. Uncle Fernando says he is going to kill himself You say? He has a gun, and says he will kill himself. He have said it to you? No, not me, Toni. Toni says he's going to marry a woman and Uncle Fernando has said that if he does, he will kill himself. That is nonsense! Where have you seen that? What do you know? Promise me that what you'll never say it to anyone Why? Or does someone else know? Promise me, then? Yes. Sleep, my life sleep, my love. Nobody has told me how much solitude is needed to know what is loneliness how much love is needed to feel loved or how much pain to want not to be born Nobody will hurt you I'll always by your side I will be with you always Manu, opens the door. Coming? He don't caughts me! I had a terrible day at school, but terrible, terrible. Why? Because I've been punished. Well, I've had a very strange dream want me to tell? Yes. I was in a train station, I wonder if you saw one of those that have many railways, crossing each other, when going out of the station Of course I've seen! You think that only those you at Madrid know everything? Well, okay, okay! I had to go from side to side of the tracks had to cross the tracks it was all full of train tracks Suddenly, I heard the whistle of a locomotive and saw a train approaching in the distance I did not know where to hide because I was in the midst of all tracks Mother! And what did you do? I stood still and closed my eyes what could I have done? If I ran it could have been worse and what happened? The locomotive coming toward me to me! Closer I stood still Yes, and what else? I woke up. Well, well! Have you seen who he was? What a shock, no? Who were they? My cousin Loly and her boyfriend Don't take it! There is blood! Do not touch it, throw it, it is very dangerous! Why? If you touch the needle you die! How does it feels that if you prick? You die, throw it, Fuensanta! Do not you ever have a shot in your veins? It hurts? Much. I can not look at it, I get dizzy. Are you in pain? Something terrible is happening! What, where? Do not know. But something is happening in this house Emilio! Your brother just fall and dies! Look what happens! Quiet, please! Calm down, please! Immediately send an ambulance! The hospital? Get me to the emergency room. Yes, by Dr. Cebrian. Don Emilio Cebri?n an ambulance to his home, Velluga Cardinal Square Emilio, they ask if it is a heart attack Yes. They immediately send it. Yes, please, urgent God! Let's see, Manu, where is Italy? Do not get distracted, where is Italy? Is it possible? What is the capital of Italy? Rome, Eternal City. Okay. In Rome, well, at the Vatican, lives the Holy Pope Where is Australia? I'll give you a clue, where are the kangaroos from? From Australia So, search I think they're here, look Do not be an ass, that's Africa! Shut up! Why is that I can not speak, or what? - No. - Why? Because I said so. Come and do your homework. Then go! But, well, what happens? Why do you cry so? Watch that bug, look at that beast! Manu pick up the telephone, it's your father. Kill it, kill it!

Manu, how is father? Okay. My child, precious. Come, Santica. Can you give me the phone? Yes, yes. See you later. See you later. What will I do when you go? You come with me. My parents will not allow me Why not? We can not live together cousin marriages are banned by Pope that's nonsense today this is not a problem Did you ever get in there? No. That's forbidden. Prohibited, banned, banned. Coming? And if we get caught? But really, what are you doing here? We wanted to know what's inside Then that's fine because curiosity is the mother of science And what do you think? Fascinating! What is this? That is the iris Who would say that in so small an area is reflected the health of a person, uh? Of course, a complex nervous system draws, like a map to each organ of the body within the iris This really interests you? Yes Look, this is the right iris, but is placed here on the left. And here, at 12 o'clock, the brain is represented and here, at 5 o'clock zone, are the female genital organs Do not you believe it's so, Fuensanta? No. Well, believe me, baby everything good and everything bad that is saved here almost everything we know comes in trough our eyes and from there we place it here in the brain but well, let's leave that now, uh? Manu, Fuensanta, stand behind the camera come, without fear, here come, come Manu and see through it Let's see what do you see? The window, and you, but in reverse. Exactly. That's how we see things. But the brain puts them upright so that no one falls from the ceiling. There are still who believe that a photograph steals your soul and that the image reflected in the mirror decreases you because on bending you, you lose half your energy but the truth is that we live from appearances reflections and illusions do not you think? Yes I see things that I can not see. True, Fuensanta sees things not seen. It's possible. Some people have these powers well, that say so Fuensanta, I've never looked at your iris, no? No. Well we're doing it right now Manu, press that button next to the window the one next to the curtain, uh? - This? - That. Come, sit. Support the chin here. Easy, uh? And look at this staring point closer, Manu. Well, do you see? Now we focus exactly See? Note what complexity secrecy and mystery are in there That is the iris of a child still clean and transparent the colors are vivid Life here is at its best let's see for a while, Fuensanta do not move here there is something somewhat unusual. what? Quiet, quiet, do not move. It's like a vibration. and you say you see things not seen, no? I also hear things. And what do you see now? I see Aunt Maggie comming and grandfather says he wants to speak to Manu on a death. But what are you saying, child! Emilio! Are there the kids? Yes, yes, they are here, Margarita. Where have you gone, uh? Have not I said it is forbidden to enter here? I'm going to seriously punish you if you think you can do whatever pleases you, you are very wrong Margarita! Okay, okay, what do you want? Dad, he is increasingly obsessed. No one withstands him. I tell him to get up and he says no that he wants to stay in bed for life. He gets intolerable says he wants to speak with Antonico. Well, we have to be patient. let him rest. But, Emilio, you said that he should exercise every day. Ok, but for one day, nothing happens. Anything else? Yes, he insists on talking to Antonico. He says: "I want to talk to my baby Antonico" uncle, whom grandfather wants to talk is Manu. can be... You no longer understand him anything he asked me for a pitcher of umbrellas He wants orange juice. But, how do you know that, my daughter? Well, come on, Manu, accompany Fuensanta, and go see grandfather and be very patient with him, please he is a very old man, go! This century is going to end badly, son will end badly this century is going to end very bad son Why will this century end badly, Grandpa? Have you heard the news? The Russians are going to Christianize and Americans are going to be all black and Communists million people have been killed for nothing, son for nothing everything's upside down in the European war they killed 50 million people do you realize what that means? What folly! Nobody agrees. And without change, there's no life. But the changes brought disaster disorganization and chaos Have you traveled a lot? I've been to Santiago de Compostela with school And what of it? Well. You have to travel, Antonico to realize what life is Here we believe we are the navel of the world Not that there is no better place to live perhaps is worse off but everywhere they baked beans I get really heavy with my sermons, right, son? No. It is the inevitable legacy of a life devoted to teaching hand me the hair on the tongue He wants a glass of water You want a glass of water? Of course! I am an useless oldman but this still works Well, Antonico, let's go to our thing I, before, before... that I have to tell you something I have not told anyone Come a little bit closer in this house a lot of things have happened, Antonico My name is Manuel Do not you remember, grandpa? The most important thing is what I'll tell you We all keep a secret of which we are ashamed, son I have my secret something that nobody knows but me and that One, if he exists. A secret I've kept with me throughout my life but now that I'm going to... I want you to know it You have been my favorite son, Antonico, my solitary bird (pajarico) You know why I named you lonely bird? No, not really. Because you were always jumping around from one place to another and you liked to be alone and reading, and be independent you're just like me And the secret? What secret? The secret, Grandpa. Ah, yes. My secret I must unload the spirit You see, those were times of war, son and in times of war, they dispelling the order of things and committed the worst atrocities on behalf of who knows what it is a time of vengeance and cruelty He came to see me dressed in black, with a gun, on the belt He came to tell me I had taken his girlfriend and that he would kill me He was a rough guy, nasty and stank of wine I was frightened I told him that she had chosen me It was true, because they are the ones who choose, son I tried to use all possible arguments to make him desist from his intentions but he came determined to kill me I do not know where I got strength but I jumped on him like a bull drew his pistol and he hit my arm I still have the signal and look, look what I did I felt a divine wrath hit him until I could not more first with the hand and then with a shovel until my fingers flayed it was horrible, I lost control and for a very long time I was another person when I came to me, and I realized what I had done, I trembled what to do? What could I do, Lord? What did you do, Grandpa? Who are you? What did you do after killing him, Grandpa? I buried him at the foot of the stairs and there he is. In the basement? In the basement, yeah. Don't you hear a heavenly sound? It's uncle Fernando coming from the hospital No, no, no, Uncle Fernando is very bad has been paralyzed for ever never be able to play the bagpipes again It rains over the fields He wants you to get down a bit the blind what will be there? Nothing ... One is gone, and that's it. I wish there was something not to die at all the way a place where one could breathe comfortably if you breathe well and feel no pain then you're in heaven How fine you are when you're fine. Why do you paint your face? To be more beautiful you want me to paint you? Ok. Why kids are not painted? What do I know? Why do you ask me? Why do you prick yourself? But what you say, you're crazy? I would not skewer. So what did you do on the terrace? Look, baby, do not get into what you're not called or I'll give you a wafer so they're not going to find you, right? I do not skewer me I do not like it Whom were you with at the terrace? Well if you're so interested, I will say with my boyfriend He pricks himself. We found a bloody syringe who else knows? Just me and Fuensanta The donkey in front That one always gets my leg. If you sing I'll kill you both! And you tell that stupid one as she doesn't mum, I'll whack her so she will remember all her life, and you too! You are playing with fire you are advised If you say a single word of it, I'll kill you is that clear? You know where your sister has gotten? With her boyfriend, I say We will have to do something with this girl otherwise we fall out She had to be home already Leave her, in these times of ours, you can not demand she get this early at home if only for discipline, dad, and an example to the young ones we must adhere to rules when she grows old she can do what she wants if she want to leave home, she leaves now she is too young to go around She is 17 years old at that age I was married to Emilio That were other times but that is not what worries me it is this boyfriend that she got he is too thin and vicious but if you just told me to do whatever she wants, what do we agree, Dad? Not confuse quail with lettuce Grandpa is right, Emilio, that kid is very pale and exerts a bad influence on her to me this kid is taking drugs it stings, with heroin. But how awful is that, dad, that boy is the son of Gimeno Well, yes, it is legit Therefore, if doped, we would know, here in Murcia knows everything. What he makes to himself, I do not care. But my Loli ... I can not sleep a wink at the thought Emilio, you have to do something! I would like you to examine him using any pretext, that kid and so, at least get out of doubt and I'd be more quiet we are totally crazy in this house, and what happens to you Margarita, whom you speak? No one, do not talk to anybody, Emilio, with whom was I to speak? That's what I want to know, whom, what happens? I knew you would sense it, I wanted to tell you let yourself off mysteries, Margarita, and tell me what happens I'll tell if you insist This morning I had a miraculous vision while in the bathroom I saw a wonderful light, it was incredible Margarita! It filled all with light, and She appeared She? Stop talking nonsense, Margarita. You've taken the pill? Of course I have taken the pill Well, pardon me, what I mean is you can not go around scaring the kids But it is the truth, and every day I took the pill This morning I told the Father Justo and he told me it was the virgin that lit the path to glory Then tell that jerk to stop sticking their noses into our lives and please sister do not you dare go telling the miracles because we will have here a pilgrimage Emilio is right about that, do not go saying that you have visions But it's the truth! Well, even if it's the truth! You shut up, or you tell me and that's it. What do you saw, aunt? How was this glow? You see, it was like a light globe to come from the beyond and fill me with its light a sense of peace and joy flooded my heart the globe opened, and a golden light filled it with everything, everything and there, inside the balloon, She was all golden, dazzling and beautiful. Good night to all! Good night, Grandpa. Let's see, you can not ever come at your time? Go, I thought it was early! How time flies, right? Tomorrow you tell your boyfriend to stop by here, I want to take a look at him Why? Because I do not like how thin and pale he is You have no right to meddle in the lives of others, dad But, well, I'll give you a slap however you are woman I need to know whom you meet, and this kid looks sick and I do not want my daughter to meet a sick guy So tomorrow you say him to come here and if he is not I'll call his father And what can you say, that Jaime is skinny? I like him that way. What can I say? Stop it, damn it! Enough is enough! I've always been a man of order peace-loving I've never said anything well, well It's not that bad, Emilio Easy, Emilio calm down Do not get so angry, that's not worth it Do not panic, occasionally he gets it but soon gets well He got this from always, his eyes got blanck, as if he were to have an attack so when he says that I am epileptic, he would do better looking himself in the mirror Do not panic, Manu, come here, young man! It's the adrenalin that has somewhere to drop Be calm, it's always the same not important it's his character No, in my opinion it has nothing to do with Uncle Fernando's mine is temporary, calm down To Dad this also happens sometimes Do you see? We only inherit the iniquities I've always been a peaceful man peace-loving Less when you almost kill the boyfriend of Aunt Margarita, grandfather This man came to the house dressed Falangist and I've always been a Republican of honor! He was not my boyfriend, he was courting me, though. And you, what a brother you get into the closet, scared to death Enough is enough, Margarita, that's a fallacy, a lie That one is true. When came Aunt Maggie's boyfriend, Emilio and I got into the closet scared to death Federico Sanchez was a very handsome boy, but when I was abusing my absences were and father forbade him to come and see me That one just wanted to fuck you I did not skeep things He was very fond of me was so passionate ... One day he came here to this house, saying that or I was his, or anyone Look, for these times ... He came pointing the pistol and saying he would kill us all if he did not carried Aunt Margarita and uncle and I tucked in the closet! And he fired? It was not grandfather who shoot? Yo don't know the fear I get through into the closet I even peed Did grandfather killed him and buried him in the basement? I killed him with these hands, and buried him in the basement This brings fantasies, dad You did not miss anything, Margarita, because what ht was, was a pimp No, no, no. You mess me I had the asparagus, when Antonio came in with the library in his hand, and gave me the speaker and I, with the leg of the thing, I told him that if he didn't give me the solution, I was not about influence peddling that I was tired of resources, bulging and corruption Calm down, Dad!

The text said where a treasure was buried When he returned from Morocco my father was devoted heart and soul to find the treasure of the Arabs which said the text was buried at the foot of an olive tree in precise coordinates. Everyone thought my father was right in the head and the matter was forgotten. But my father, after many twists and turns, found the treasure. It was a fabulous treasure with hundreds of gold coins and priceless jewels. He said nothing to anyone was silent as a death in the event that the dead could talk Well, gradually selling those currencies here and there he gave a carrer to all his children and still had enough money to buy a house here in Murcia and another one in the Urrutia in the Minor Sea Is that true, uncle?
