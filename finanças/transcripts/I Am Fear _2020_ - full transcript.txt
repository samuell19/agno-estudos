Some years ago, as I was about to go on the air with a back story about the formative days of Slobodan Milosevic in Serbia, my producer came up to me and said that an intern had taken it upon herself to fact-check the story, and had discovered a discrepancy. Well, rather than get angry five minutes before the broadcast, I said, well, you know, bring her here. I want to meet her right now. Well, Ernie took off and a moment later he came back, and following him was this 22-year-old Georgetown graduate. It was the intern. Her hair was done up in a greasy ponytail. She stepped onstage, into the light that's supposed to wrap my face, okay? She stuck out her hand, and in shock I shook it. She gave me this knowing grin, and do you remember what you said to me? Of course I remember. I said we've never met, but my name is Sara Brown and you're gonna want to hear what I have to tell you next. You'll be blindfolded and the drive will be long. You'll have exactly 20 minutes with Ra'ar, and if all goes as planned, be back in Baghdad roughly 13 hours. If all goes as planned. If all goes as planned. Thank you. Rain in the desert. Must be your lucky day. Have fun. Samir. My pocket. The lighter. Samir. You missed it. The Abaris have moved on, taking with them their all-you-can-rape buffet. Some was easy. The women and children, they fled up the mountain on foot to pray for mercy from their peacock god. That was interesting. Did you know that since Assyrian times, their faith forbids them to write? Do you even know what faith they were originally? I'll give you a hint. They weren't Shiite. They're sorrier than Christians. And if you thought that were Zoroastrianists, you'd be wrong as well. They were Satanists. Pre-Islamic devil worshipers. Then in good old oral tradition, so the story goes, in Assyrian times at the top of Mount Sinjar stood the temple of Melek. Now, even if this cosmogonic-infatuated world we live in today, Melek would be considered the devil. But back then, Melek translated meant simply king. And unlike God, Melek did not want your donations on a Sunday. And really unlike God, Melek could not give a fuck about your prayers. No, what Melek wanted from the Yazidis was their fear. And to the Yazidis, as far as God goes, God was anyone or anything that could deliver them from Melek. Now, doesn't that sound more real to life than all other bullshit we hear today, huh? You don't have to do this. I have my own money. I can take you to it. Respectfully, Asad, and I do respect you, you are a good pro, but why would you still be in this pissed-in sandbox asshole end of the world if you had any amount of money I gave a shit about, huh? Tens of thousands of dollars. - Asad, hey! - Sterling. No, no, no, Asad, you don't understand. I don't give a shit about this pitiful sum of money. No, far more valuable to me is seeing what happens to people who try to rip off my money drop, and to their families. Not my son. Hey, yes your son. If you needed cash, you should have stolen from the Americans or the Germans, and lied about it like the Russians. No, no, no, no, no, no, my son. Hey, it's not your fault. You did not know the Yazidi secret. Neither did I, because it's never been written anywhere. Has to be whispered to you. It's far better for you to see it and to experience it. Shall I whisper it to you? He's here. Baba! Asad, smile. You're on camera. Don't talk, don't talk. ♪ Row, row, row your boat ♪ ♪ Gently down the stream ♪ ♪ Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily ♪ ♪ Life is but a dream ♪ That's it, that's it, pray. Pray that his life is sensitive. ♪ Row, row, row your boat gently down the stream ♪ Baba. ♪ Merrily, merrily, merrily ♪ ♪ Life is but a dream ♪ Oh God, oh, God. Baba. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no, no! No, no, no. No, no, no, no, ho, ho, ho, ho. Kill me first! No, not my son, no, no! Kill me first! Not my son, kill me, me! Please, please, no! Kill me first! I want to ask you about, about the secular component of the Islamic State. The movement began with a few private, anonymous investors who funded early operations. Now as the caliphate spans thousands of miles, it controls banks, oil fields, mining facilities. With these millions of dollars... It's not millions. It's billions. Well, with it you're able to employ... Say it. With these billions of dollars, you're able to employ members of the global mercenary community. When we use them, you call them mercenaries. When America uses them, they're called security contractors. That's a good point. With these billions of dollars, you're able to better train Islamic State fighters, assassinate tribal leaders, even hire an expansive team of counterintelligence experts to help protect yourself. The wake of the caliphate's expansion has shown a clear strategic emphasis on capturing these resources and monetary gain. Is Allah concerned with wealth? Why don't you ask the Pope how God likes living in his home in the Vatican? Allah is not a Marxist. Allah is not a capitalist. God is simply Allah, and his philosophy is unambiguous. So you might say that we are in revolt against any philosophy that places itself above the word of Allah. But that doesn't pay the rent. Well, how would you describe the difference between you and Osama bin Laden? I am not at the bottom of the ocean. Ideologically. Al-Qaeda was willing to wait a century to create the caliphate and Islamic State. Where they seek the reverent and the wealthy, we seek the bold and disaffected, but we are willing to accept the fearful just the same. That is how we few became many. You want to know what Osama bin Laden really concerned himself with? You. He was concerned with spectacular acts of reprisal, seeking to cull the support of the media. The more the act had size, the greater the media attention, and the more people who would watch, the more the world feared. The more the world feared, the more who watched. And yet one might say the more attention bin Laden got, the more he became a target. Asad, this fear is touching divinity. You are offering to the Yazidikin the closest thing to his experience anyone can have around these parts. Can you feel it, Asad? It's beautiful. I know you can keep the secret. Don't fucking move! God is anything that can save you, huh? Your god today, Asad, is in that duffel bag. Save your prayers. She'll fucking love you. Just stay there. There you go. Polar sky, I repeat, polar sky is confirmed KIA. All right. I'm afraid our time together is up. On behalf of GBN, I'd like to thank you for granting me this exclusive interview, and for respecting the safety of foreign journalists in conflict areas. The whole world is a conflict area, Sara. What do you think it would take for people to realize that? As-salamu alaykum. 50L10, see if you can get SWAT gear out of area 50. All officers, suspects are wearing body armor. What the fuck is this? - What the fuck is this? - It's a traffic chopper. - Will you shut this thing up? - I need this fucking thing. - Just calm the fuck down. - Son of a bitch. - Fuck! - Is he dead? - He's just passed out. - God. You were supposed to be covering, you little piece of shit. I didn't see him. You're gonna be all right. I don't wanna die. I don't wanna die. Move it, what are you waiting for? Just bring him in here. - Take it easy, take it easy. - Bring him in here. Put him down, put him down. Here you go, let's see what I got. I need to see what I have, I need to see what I have. This is gonna take a minute to take effect. I cannot stay up anymore. No, no. You will wake up again, if not here, in the Jannah. I don't wanna die. - It's okay, it's okay. - I don't wanna die. - I want to wake up here. - You won't die. He has to take it out. He has to take it... No, no. Okay, we're gonna get this out. - Hey! - We're gonna get this. - No, no, no, no, no, no, no. - Hey. Hey, God dammit. - Do something. - Come on. Okay, okay. - What, what, what? - He's not breathing. - Why'd you stop? - Here. Hold this, hold this on his face, right here. Hold this on his face, right there. Okay, you pump, you pump right there, okay? Come on, come on, come on. - Where's the defibrillator? - I don't have anything else. I don't have a defibrillator. Just keep pumping. Ahmad is dead. Our fucking doctor is a junkie. He's got fucking track marks all over his arms. Looks like another one of our chat room starts fucks up. Someone go check on her. There was nothing else I could do. I know, I know. Um, Moosavi, are you familiar with trance music? You know trance pop? What? You know, like. Shit. Fuck, shit. Motherfucker. Do you have demands, or are you just gonna kill me? We have demands, and we're just gonna kill you. Please let RJ go. He has a family. I'm enough for the camera. He's of no use to you. I don't see how letting him go would be of any use to us. He's got a a little girl. She's two. What's your name? My name is Jalliel. Jalliel, may I make a request? It doesn't matter what he did. It doesn't matter. It does matter. He was a fucking junkie. You can't trust junkies. I'm in charge here. You don't do shit like this. Where are the track marks? Right there, they're just covered in blood. Show me. Right fucking here. Wait, wait a minute. Wait. I don't see any track marks. I, I saw track marks. Did you see any? I wasn't looking, but I don't know why we cut him. Well, he's dead now. It is what itis. Who gave her the chat? You gave her the chat, right? Well, she wanted something to paint with. Think before you do something stupid like this. Why don't you, uh, give her her cell phone back? Are into flames. However, the big story of... Developing since the break, a group of masked men... Armed with automatic rifles, stormed... Was a shootout and kidnapping, apparently involving GBN correspondent and well-known conservative political commentator, Sara Brown. - Sara Brown... - Sara Brown... EN correspondent, Sara Brown. For her tireless efforts, working with the World Refugee Children's Fund. The organization had raised 230... Brown has been in the spotlight recently, because of her exclusive and seemingly impossible interview with Islamic State commander, Ra'ar al Yasim a few months... = Put this on now. I said now! Fucking move it! The price is death. No one is truly safe, not any more. So enjoy your fireworks. You know, I used to have a small house outside of Zayouna in Baghdad. Just me, my mother, and Samir. - Remember? - Yeah. And his mom, what happened to her again? She died in childbirth. Sure, we all had ups and downs, but my family was safe. My son was going to school. So we became at peace with being powerless. Then you invaded, again. And Saddam got on the TV and radio and said that we were gonna win again. My mother, who was dying, came to me and said it was time for us to act now, no matter what the Americans did. It was time for Iraq to answer the call of justice and remove Saddam. So I listened. Four months later, I was working with the Delta Force as a translator, and we pulled Saddam out of that fucking rat hole where he was hiding. The time when I helped you with Saddam, that week my son's school was fucking blown up. I told my son there will be schools in America that he can go to. But then, nothing. We got nothing. You forgot the part where you disobeyed the team commander when you beat the shit out of Saddam. Took a makeup team over an hour to get him ready for the arraignment. It was fucking Saddam. They should've fucking hung him right there. Yeah, you also forgot the part where you tried to smuggle $80,000 in bearer bonds into Turkey, coming back. Those were mine. - Bullshit. - Yeah. They were traced back to a bank in Tecriq, a bank that was owned by Saddam's family. That was a safety deposit box my mother had before she died. She was from Tecriq. Your mom is Jordanian. So agree to fucking disagree, okay? So what now? Am I to pose as a lone wolf recruiter and infiltrate some dormant sleeper cell? Use some of my Ra'ar credibility once again? That shit works until it fucking doesn't. We got this bill we need Congress to pass to help the Vice President outsource Federal law enforcement jobs to a private company. So we, uh, we need you to shoot up a junior high school in North Hollywood. No mass casualties. Maybe no more than five, six. - Kids. - Yeah. We're just fucking with you. CIA doesn't really do that kind of shit. Fuck no, unless you believe nine out of 10 old Black guys that will tell you differently. - That kinda shit, really. - Fuck you guys, man. So what is it? Exactly what you said. Word for word, literally. Get in. Where is Ahmad? He was supposed to be with you. I need his authorized confirmation. Not without his confirmation. I won't ask you again. Are you fucking crazy? I want his confirmation now, or we all die. Your reputation precedes you, Asad. I am Ahmad, and you are Asad Nasir, who Ra'ar still trusts. Please come in the back. This just in: according to Los Angeles fire officials, it has now been confirmed that all of these fires are the work of one single arsonist, and we're basing this, of course, off of reports on the type of incendiary and burn patterns found at the scene. 271 days, we do know it has been, since we've had any rainfall in Southern California, and these fires can't seem to come at a worse time. Breaking news from the United States. UCLA Medical Center has let us know that Alex Schamoff, the security officer injured in the shootout in Los Angeles, has passed away from the injuries he sustained. We are now going live to Los Angeles. What the fuck? What's going on? What are you looking at? I bet you a whole fucking white American cunt's life that nobody has done anything to you but kiss your ass, give you nice clothes, and tell you how fucking white and amazing you are, and make you feel like you're somebody special. Why didn't Ra'ar just kill me then? Why now? Just waited until his interview was shown all over the fucking world? Don't feel so important. You're just a primetime news whore who sucked Jew dicks to be on TV. What's so terrifying about dying in Iraq? It happens every day. It's terrifying to Americans when it happens on your doorstep, on the land of the free and disbelievers. There are no more borders in the world, not even in the caliphates. Everywhere. I don't know what that means, because I am just a primetime news whore. Do you think when you're facing the blade, you'll lose that sassy mouth that's always interrupting men on GBN, while you're screeching and talking over them? This is Ra'ar, operating in Iraq in 2006. The man on his right is the founder of the Islamic State, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. Back then IS was just a division of al-Qaeda. Ra'ar was a Sunni cleric in Mosul who started his own 180-man brigade during the insurgency. This is a more recent photograph of Ra'ar, one of the first of him not wearing any glasses. Supposedly he underwent laser corrective surgery about a year before I interviewed him. It's actually not uncommon for some of these higher-up guys to have had the same doctors their whole lives. It sounds more like a rich kid thing than a terrorist thing if you ask me. What did your family think about the risk you took? I mean, two French journalists were beheaded, what was it, just two weeks ago? What made you think they'd keep their word about your safety? I don't have any family. I was adopted, and my parents were older. That's the one bonehead question I'm going to allow myself. Look, it sounds like you're asking me if I have a death wish. Am I correct? I mean, you said it. The last time I had a death wish, I was in this school, taking this course, and we had to read 400 pages of Graham Greene a weekend. Uh, these Kurdish tribal leaders... Who was the man you just skipped over? That was Joshua Halil. I say was because supposedly Joshua Halil, an Israeli officer in the Shayetet 13, which is their Navy SEAL equivalent, supposedly he died in a helicopter crash in Afghanistan in 2010. Who is he? He was the world's most proficient counterinsurgent, turned private contractor. He was known by Hamas as Atam, or The Darkness. And it's rumored that he had risen to number two on the CIA's most wanted list. Last question is from Michael, a second-year German exchange student from the University of Hamburg. As a journalism student, I have noticed that your style of coverage is becoming more and more fearmongering. Can't you tell the difference between the godless ideals of ISIS, and true Allah-fearing Muslims? Do you also think I got Ahmad killed? I think it was his time to go. Even leaders make mistakes. I think Allah is testing my resolve. Let me tell you something. As some might have you believe, Allah does not only respect killers. I'm not an idiot. I know you're not believers. And so? So you're mercenaries. We kill for money, and you kill in the name of God. What's the difference? People still die. So who's Joshua Halil? Why? Well, I heard Bashu and Shabaviz speaking by Sara's cell. He was death. He is the man who killed my son, Samir. He worked for Ra'ar, doing things I would never do. I killed him. What are these for? For our extraction plan. And just in case we got the cops on our ass. Here we go. These two men. Ziad Nazari and Hassan al Najari went AWOL last week. They're Iraqi police trainees. They were here in the US on a joint training operation with Army Rangers. Washington has been trying to bridge these relations between the new Iraqi government and the US by doing this kind of shit. Big fucking mistake. These two guys just walked off the base last week. Don't recognize either one of them. Maybe they're at the safe house, but I haven't been there yet. They're still keeping you in the dark, even though Ra'ar personally put you in the cell? That's right, shortly after we got ahold of Joshua, we started to receive cyber intel. A very motivated source was telling us that Ra'ar was reaching out, trying to find you. That's why we chose that cell for you to cut into. I mean, that's what Ra'ar wanted. He trusts you. How come you still don't know their objective? I mean, it could be a dirty bomb, could be a mass shooting. Hell, it could be a fucking catered luncheon at the 21 Club for all we know. See you in 24 hours. So what the fuck were you doing in there? Spying on me? Did I tell you you could come in? Ra'ar didn't say we should do that. Ra'ar is not here right now, is he? - Hey, hey. - This is why we killed him. He can't shoot straight. You can't hear well. What the fuck can you do, hold the fucking camera? It's combat. Shit happens. Yeah, well if I was on his six, he wouldn't have. Why did Ra'ar even send you, man? You're not devout. You're a fucking mercenary with no country, no faith, no family. You're right. And also don't forget, no more patience either. We're good? You fucked up. That's what she said when she mouthed off to me. That's why I choked her. Long ago I was in love with a girl, Halima Nioi. Her father, Rashid, hated me. He used to call me that. Halima had epilepsy. One day when she was driving, she had an attack, and drove into an American checkpoint. They killed her, of course, thinking she was a bomber. Rashid came to my home and said it was my fault. He said if I was with her, that wouldn't have happened. He had a bomb. He wanted me to avenge her death. I refused. I was scared. That evening he went to the checkpoint himself with the bomb. It was just a coincidence. She pronounced it exactly like he did. Asad, have you ever known anyone that acts the way she acts? I mean, she's painting a fucking picture right now. And how did she know about Joshua Halil? She's an international news correspondent. That's bullshit and you know it. Joshua was blacked out, blacker than black. No civilian could know shit about him, no matter how well-connected. Maybe no civilian. What does that mean? That means she was a spook, a fucking CIA cunt. She's not CIA. There are no fucking black helicopters. She just said a name. I say we do the cameraman now, initiate the extraction plan, and we'll do her just right before we go. No. No one is going to break the plan because a bitch has us all stir-crazy. Ra'ar gave the order, and we execute them, right? He wanted her. And no one is going to change the plan until I say so. Whose watch is it? Mine, I'm going. Welcome back. We start with breaking news from our top commanders of new forces in the insurgency of new Iraq. The spokesman there said it took several days to confirm through DNA testing, but we have learned that Ra'ar al Yasim's body was in fact one of the bodies found inside the bunker. Again, the Pentagon is confirming at this hour, Ra'ar al Yasim is deceased, and has been for almost four months now. The details of his death and the whereabouts of the secret bunker where this body was found have yet to be revealed. Of course, keep it tuned right here. We will follow this story day and night to bring you more information. As soon as Ahmad briefs you on your cell's objective, you're to contact us immediately. When's your next pickup? Tomorrow night. Two-way with us after. Remember, keep your cell phone powered on at all times. We're running the StingRay so we can track you. Okay. Asad, get in. I thought we weren't meeting until tonight. Surrender all your personal items. What's going on? The mission is how underway. Finished? Take him inside. Take his boots off, let's go. Say, bro, that house of yours is in Porter Ranch, right? Shit, man. 10 houses already burned down. That's right, your whole fucking city is burning. What the hell is going on? I don't know anymore. My money is on something having to do with this. Is that where your money is? Tell me something about your money. Is that why The Darkness killed your son, because you ripped off his money, huh? And I bet you that you knew Halil would come after you if you stole it, right? Except in the process, your son, what was his name, Samir? He gets cut up, right? But then I put two and two together. Joshua, Ra'ar's right-hand man knows. He's working both sides. You ever mention my son again, I will do to you what I did to Joshua. Go on, do it. You got no choice. Do it. I thought you were never going to come speak to me. It's hard for a girl to make the first move, Major Nasir. What is this? Are you the little girl, asking for salvation from a peacock angel? She's beautiful, isn't she? How do you know Joshua Halil? I'm an international news correspondent. You can cut the bullshit. I have your necklace right here, Sara. Were you just fucking him to get intel on the Green Zone, or did you actually care about him? You're just trying to find a justification for killing me. Anybody who can love that sadistic fuck cannot be any different herself. I don't know you very well, Asad, but I know you well enough to know that you're a man looking for faith, ever since Samir's murder. How do you know about that? Deep down, you wonder if you're going to heaven or hell. I just wonder how a man who's heard the secret can possibly still wonder. Heard what secret? I think you know. You have less than a day left. I do know that. Sara? Please make sure the world sees my painting. I will, Sara. I promise. We're best friends now, Asad. In fact, he loves it. Stop it. Stop fucking sharpening that knife. I'm glad you're back. You ran off earlier. RJ just got caught in the middle of this fight. He had no idea who you really are. Well, he's in good company then, Asad, because neither do you. You are a spook, a scared CIA pawn in over her head. I know you are, Asad, but what am I? I know there's no excuse to be juvenile at a time like this. It's just, you did walk right into that one. Why don't you tell me who you really are? Ladies first. Why don't you tell me what it was like when you cut my dear Joshua's head off? Did he scream? Did his throat gurgle? Did you use duct tape or zip ties to keep him from flailing around? That's right, you didn't need to, because he was already dead. No, I killed him. I cut the fucker's head off for what he did to my son. No, he wasn't alive when you cut his head off, not like Samir was. So you didn't really avenge his death, did you? Just please, please, when you put RJ and I in front of the camera, please kill me first. Need a drink right about now? I have an idea. Why don't we watch the video? You know, the one where you cut Joshua's head off after he died. It's on the same tape as Samir's, isn't it? I bet you somebody has it around here. I would actually really like to see it again. Where did you see it? See, that's not fair, Asad, because you haven't answered any of my questions yet. I saw it on Ra'ar's laptop. - Sleeper cells. - It makes sense. - We never saw this news. - Of course. He wouldn't really want you to know. What are you doing here? It's an honor to meet you, Asad. I was just asking the rest of your team the same question. What are you talking about? He means she wasn't even our fucking mission, Asad. How is that possible? We're working on direct orders from Ra'ar. Did you that Ra'ar is dead? He never switched hideouts. The American intel found him in his bunker, along with the others, dead. It's all over the news. It has been for awhile, except they are not releasing the circumstances of his death. Oh, fuck me. Your mission was to facilitate and evacuate my arson team. Who do you think set up all these fires? We knew you guys were here. You just never checked in. We were instructed to have zero contact, because our phones and email may be tracked. Fucking bullshit. You're a fucking liar. Joshua is dead, and now Ra'ar, but not before he assigns you to this mission. He was fucking dead. How could he? Where you going, chat room boy? How did they die, Ra'ar, the rest? Somebody butchered them. She's on every news website and network on the planet. She's fucking number one trending on Twitter. I don't know about you guys, but this is all making sense to me. Butchered, like Joshua Halil. Not like Halil, worse. He was dismembered, disemboweled. The Americans found their bodies, what was left of them. They'd been rotting down there for awhile. Listen to me. There is something very wrong, but I had nothing to do with it. If Ahmad was not getting his orders from him, then who? Was it you, Hassan? You, Ziad? Before I left for Fort Henry, I spoke with Ra'ar, and he said you were the most skilled killer he had ever met, but that you are now a disbeliever, and he didn't know if he could still trust you. Did he say anything else? He did. What was it? I'm forgetting. Oh. He said that if there were anything to happen to him, it was because of you, and that we should kill your CIA ass. I have a family. I have a family. Please, please, no. Please, please, please, no. Please, God, no. I have a family. I have a little girl. That's more than I ever got. Fuck you. ♪ Row, row your boat ♪ ♪ Gently down the stream ♪ ♪ Merrily, merrily, merrily ♪ ♪ Life is but a dream ♪ When you look at it, what do you see? Nothing. When you look at me, what do you see? I see a farmer's son who's filled with hate and fear. And that gives me hope. I'm about to show you the real face of terror. How can you show me when you haven't even seen it yourself? And as it was once, it will be again. In the name of the almighty Allah, know that when our children die in the name of jihad, they go serenely and quietly into the loving arms of Allah. When your children die, they sound like this. Where did she go? Give me the fucking key. Where did she go? I don't know where she is. Someone! You stay away from me! Don't worry, Asad. Hey, we're right behind you. We got your back. Hey, Steve McQueen, how you enjoying America? How about some music? That's what we liked. For everything I helped you with, be Asad. Why would a devil run from bullets? There is no devil, Asad. There is no God either. There is only fear. Fear is the only motive. But you are all sheep, listening, believing everything you hear. Fucking sheep. Baba. It was never all right, my heart. It has always been you, Samir. I knew your prophets. I knew your prophets, and they all tasted as good as Ra'ar. But none of them had any answers for me. Do you, Asad? I know you are, but what am I? It's been two weeks since your harrowing escape from your terrorist captors, barely making it out of the building alive before the building itself collapsed in flames behind you. Your story has touched the hearts and minds of most Americans. In fact, Congress just voted to fund an emergency measure set forth by the President to begin background registration and procedures in place to process every Muslim in America, and to close the borders to all non-Americans. Just made it out of the warehouse, you're waiting for the police. What were you thinking? I was thinking this is a sign. This is the sign you've been waiting for, Sara. This is a sign from God. God has let you live so that you can go on to do more. So that I can tell my story to you, to America, to the world. Because knowledge is power, and the good people here and abroad deserve to know the truth. I'm not gonna lie, Steve. We have every reason to be fearful.
