Oh, my god, John! What are you doing? No! No! They're trying to kill us! Slow down! John, slow down! You're probably wondering how I got myself into this situation. Well, let me tell you a story. Is this right? How's this? Great, Toby. Maybe start by telling us how you would describe yourself. How would I describe myself? Oh, geez. I don't know. I'm pretty boring, if you want to know the truth. Hi. Uh, I'm the man formerly known as John Maynard. Now I'm inmate 5564789-43. It's a lot of numbers to remember, but I got some time on my hands. Rest of my life, actually. I never smoked a cigarette. I married the first man I ever dated. People say I manipulated Toby for freedom. That's a load of crap. It had nothing to do with that. I was a rule-follower, that's for sure. Well... except that one time. The real reason I did what I did was simple... - We were in love. - We were in love. Before all this happened, if you had asked me what my life was like, I would have said my life was just perfect. But it wasn't, of course. I'd just been laid off from my job, and my son had started college, so house was pretty empty. Life had just become... one big checklist. The truth is, my life wasn't about me. Yeesh! That was a tricky one, but I finally got it. You want to see how it turned out? Hon? Yeah, I see. You know, I was thinking... that maybe we could get a dog or a couple of kittens. What? Well, you know, now that Adam is-is off on campus, we don't have to worry so much about his allergies, so I... He still comes over for dinner, drops off his laundry for you every couple of weeks. Right. Yeah, I guess that's true. Hard-to-adopt dogs are starting to symbolize a ray of hope for inmates in a program that rehabilitates them both. The positive influence the pups have on the inmates is almost instantaneous. Prisoners learn to train the dogs... You know, I just love working here. I've always wanted to work with animals. And some day, I'd like to do something like that... something meaningful. Well, you should try. You might be good at it. Can I make some calls? Sure. - Hi. - Hey, hey, hey. Hi. Everything seemed normal... until a visit with my dad. Cancer... you've got cancer? You don't need to worry about me, though. Of course, I'm gonna worry, Dad. What... We've got a great doctor. Uh, Doctor, uh...? Swamy. That's right, Dr. Swamy. He believes in aggressive treatment, so that's good. I mean, with radiation and chemo, there's a chance that it'll shrink down. It's amazing what the doctors can do these days. Uh, did they say what, uh, what stage it's at? Oh, geez. My roast. Heh. I don't want to burn it again. Uh, Pat, can you lend me a hand? Yeah, you bet. All right, that's enough for today. 'Kay. I'm putting the game on. I'm not dead yet. Are you in pain, Dad? Never felt better. You know me, I'm a tough tomato. I know. Hey. One foot in front of the other, Sweetpea. That's all we can do. It's all we can do. My d ad's cancer was kind of an eye-opener. It made me realize that any of us could go at any time, and I just felt I hadn't really done anything with my life. That didn't sit right with me. It didn't sit right with me at all. Oh, hey, Deb. Come on. Let me help you. Come on, we'll get you fixed up. Toby, we got ourselves a big boy today. - Aw. - I'm calling him "Buddy." Found him on 12th and Victory. I can't look at every stray off the street, Deb. I'm running a business. He is so sweet. Someone is gonna claim him. He's a large breed, and the shelters are at capacity. Are you taking him home? Only wish I could. I am living with my mother right now. Ah, with Adam at college, I could make some room at the house. You two like strays more than I do. Oh, we sure do. You should see some of my ex-boyfriends. Ah, yeah. I've met them. Geez. She's not kidding. Okay. Don't worry, Pat. I'll keep in him in the garage. It's not for long. Hey, Pat. It was like, as soon as I started to take a little control of my life, God wanted me to take a little more. So, I told Mom, if your diverticulitis is acting up again, you know, you really need to call the doctor, because he is here to help... Um... Hello? Uh, yes, I-I would love to come into the prison and give a presentation to the warden. - "Warden"? - Friday? Yeah, Friday at two would be just fine. No. No, thank you. I'll see you soon. That was... That was one of the prisons I called. Yeah, they want us to come in and give a presentation about the rescue dogs working with the inmates. "Friday" Friday? Like, two-days-from-now Friday? You're what? I'm giving a presentation for the dog/prison program. Geez, I hope they like it. I don't like it. At all! Please. Pat... I'm not gonna be alone with any prisoners. They are dangerous people. Sure, okay, but doesn't everyone deserve to feel loved? And there are guards and Deb will be there. Great. You and Deb. Two middle-aged women who haven't so much as stolen a candy bar. Middle-aged? Geez. I prefer "mature". My dogs and your inmates. Both need a little TLC. Now, I truly believe that they can rehabilitate each other. See, as an animal lover, I know that dogs make life better. They just do. Our program rescues dogs from shelters. We would bring them here, and your prisoners would... would train them in basic obedience and socialization. When the dogs are ready, we'll find them their forever families. Mr. Jenkins, you and I both know that dogs can have a paws-itive... effect. "Paws-itive," like... Right. Paws... positive. I checked her references. I mean, she seemed really nice, she was a really nice lady. Okay, so I didn't call them, but I emailed them... and, you know, some of them got back to me. I did everything I was supposed to. I mean, I followed protocol and... I mean, who would've guessed, right? And we were short-staffed, so... so, no-brainer. This is Toby and Deb from the "Always Loved" Dog Rescue. Hi, ladies. - Hi. - We need you to show some I.D. It's just routine. - Okay? - Thanks. - Want to pop the trunk for me? - Yeah. Y'all ever been to a prison before? I picked up my cousin from the drunk tank once. This is a secure facility, and we're starting small, just a few prisoners, but never let your guard down. Got me? Mm-hmm. What's up, beautiful? Mm-hmm. I like the looks of them bitches. Don't make eye-contact. Why? I think it's considered confrontational. Look. Here's Damian. Ms. Young, Ms. Odum. This is Mateo and Darnel. This is a privilege, and as such, it can be taken away at any time. So listen up. Be respectful. I'll be watching. Uh, welcome to the Always Loved Dog Rescue Program. I'm Toby and this is Deb. Hi. And we brought some friends along to meet you guys. Darnel... this is Gumbi. He's a little hyper, as you can see. He was chained outside a car dealership, so he's got a lot to learn. He's got some fear aggression, so he needs a gentle hand. I know how you feel. And this... is Princess. Is she okay? Why... Why is she shaking? She was probably abused. She needs you to make her feel safe. Look at that little thing, man. Well, uh... you'll be responsible for the animals 24-7. That means love, care, feeding, grooming, exercise, and teaching some basic commands. Well, how long do we get to keep 'em for? Well, that depends. You'll know you've succeeded at your job when your dog is ready to be adopted. So we're sort of like foster dads? Yeah. A lot like that. Excuse me. You want me in your program. I'm the best dog trainer you'll see here. Is that so? It is. Hooligan. Is that your name? Hooligan? Some seem to think so. It's my ink. It's John. John Maynard. Maynard. Hit the court or get back inside. Sorry. They're all from the same cell block. Be seeing you soon. My first impression of John? He just oozed confidence. I thought, "Yeesh, here's a guy who knows what he wants," and there is nothing more attractive than that. And sure enough, that next week, when I brought more dogs to the prison, there he was. All right, ladies, I'm adding a few prisoners to the program. All right, Toby, they're all yours. Told you I'd be back. Hello, John. Hey, Hooligan, what the hell are you doing here? This is the one. This is my dog. That's Jupiter, and she's got some trust issues, and she has been known to bite. I can relate. All right. Well, your job is to make her feel safe, so you can start by praising her. Here you go. Hey. John made that dog his best friend. He was the best dog trainer I'd ever seen. He had a way with... well, geez... everybody. It's smokin', right? I know you like Caddies, but I'm more of a Mustang man, myself. How's it going? Good, just a couple buddies hanging out. I meant the training. Well, time for the dog-and-pony show. Come on, Jupe. Let's go. Jupe... sit. Down. Raise. Down. Ah! That's a good girl! I can't believe it. She's a different dog. You got a real talent for this, John. Well, I learned from the best, teach. That's a great smile. Princess, look at you. Aw. Yeah, she's like my ex. A real bitch at first, but she warms up once you spoil her... spa treatments, massages. Well, good work, Mateo, John. Your dogs are ready for the adoption fair. Actually, Toby... you said, the first day, that if we knew someone who could adopt our dog... that's my sister-in-law, Carmen. If she takes Princess, you know, she can send me photos and updates, you know? Sure. I'm happy to help. I'll leave Princess with you while I try to reach out, okay? Appreciate it. We knew this day was coming. You saved her life, John. She gets a second chance now. I know. You saved my life a little, too, girl. We were men that were in a prison, some of us for decades. We weren't allowed to touch each other, to hug, to pat each other on the back. Human beings need physical contact. Toby and Toby's program... God, it meant the world to us. Today is all about socialization, so we gotta assert a calm energy so the dogs stay calm. Uh, John, can you run this exercise by yourself? Does that mean I get to be teacher's pet? Come on, man. Uh... Mateo, I can't get a hold of Carmen. Yeah, well, you're gonna have to call her at night, she works. I've tried four or five times. I've left messages, too. You gotta keep trying, then. I don't know. I'm sorry, but if I can't get a hold of her, I'm gonna have to look into another home for Princess. Listen, cupcake. I told you, not once, not twice, but three times, that she was gonna take her, okay? But, for some reason, you're not listening. I don't know what it is that you're not catching, but honestly, it's pissing me the hell off right now, so if you want an issue, I got an issue with you, okay? So what is it, huh? You gonna listen or what? - I'm-I'm... - What? Huh? Won't listen to me, huh? Why won't you listen, huh? Calm down. Let the dog go. All right? Go back to your cell block. You all right? Yeah. I just... I hope this doesn't affect your willingness to continue with the program 'cause y-you're doing a lot of good around here. Well, can you assign me a guard? I wish I could do that, but we don't have the resources. I won't let anything happen to you, Toby. Toby, this is the absolute worst time for me to be to telling you this, but I just found out that Mom's diverticulitis is acting up again. I'm not gonna be able to come to the prison with you every day. I promise to protect her, Deb. Is that a "Scout's honor" promise, John? Are you okay with this, Toby? Yeah, yeah. That's okay. You got to take care of your mom. Thank you, John. Yeah. Thanks, John. After the... incident... things calmed down... and the program just kept growing. I mean, we were having a lot of fun. I mean, escorting her around, protecting her... it made me feel proud. That was something I hadn't felt in a long time... maybe ever. Lord, made a woman Outta me You look good today. Oh, thank you. I mean, you look good every day. How was your night? It was fine. Hey, good morning, Miss Toby. Uh, I was wondering if I could get one of them dogs. Submit your letter. Yeah, I went to bed early last night. How was your night? It was great. I knew I was gonna see you this morning. Did you have any dreams? Dreamt I was back in high school and I took you to a dance. All right, listen up! Toby's got something to say. It felt like I was making a difference, like what I was doing was important. I felt important. Hey. You've reached Adam. Leave a message and I'll call you back. Hey, honey. It's Mom. Just finished up at work for the day, was hoping to talk with you. I love you so much. I miss you more. Bye. Oh, hi. Sorry, babe. Gotta go. Hey. Hey, hey. Let me... let me do it for you. Oh... Thank you. You okay? Yeah, yeah. I'm great. You know, you're, uh... you're changing this place for the better. It was pretty hopeless before you got here. Yeah, I just bring dogs in. You're the one that's so good with them. You know, the men really respect you. Respect means nothing without a purpose. You give these guys a purpose. Escorting you around is the best part of my day. I don't know if this is appropriate or not... you look beautiful today. It was like pouring water on a dying plant. You cutting out early? Uh, nope, I'm here till five. Uh, I thought you had, like, a hot date or something. Geez. Uh... no. Do you need a hand there? No, I've got this. Can I ask you a question? Uh, yeah. You're here all the time, like, sometimes eight hours a day. What does your husband feel about you spending all your time here? Oh, he doesn't mind. Hours spent here are hours not spent at home. Well, 30 years of marriage has created a bond between us that isn't measured in hours-per-week. 30 years? Yeah. Yeah, I was 15 when I met him. He was the only guy I ever dated. Well, my most serious relationship was when I was 15, and I'm glad I didn't marry her. Pretty sure she's glad she didn't marry me, either. Still, he probably misses you when you're gone. I know I do. Hey, Toby? Can I get your help with something out here? Yeah. I got this. Thanks. I was saying to Mom, "if you want to feel better, this is what you're gonna..." Toby? Are you okay? Yeah. Sorry. I was thinking about something the dogs were doing today. Oh. Hey, did you change your makeup or something? Because you are glowing. No. It's exactly the same. Well, you really do look great. Anyway, Toby, I think I'm gonna have to come here even less than I already have been. Maybe I wanted to believe I was changing. So I give him the dog, and you know what he said, Mom? He said he couldn't believe people would do such horrible things to a dog. This is John? That's his name? Yeah. John. Well, John must have done something pretty bad himself to end up in prison. No, well, see, that's the whole point, Mom. It's all about redemption for these guys. It... geez, it's just so powerful. Where's Pat tonight? On duty at the fire station. He's been working a lot of night-shifts. You two spending a lot less time together? Can I go wake up Dad and just say hi? No. Let him sleep. It sounds strange to say it, but the prison became my sort of escape. I was given access to the whole cellblock and free reign to go where I pleased. Hey, baby. How you doin'? Oh, hey. Brought you these... some extra goodies from the supply room. Hey-hey. Hear that, bud? She takes good care of us. Yeah, I finished my paperwork, if you could walk me out. Sure. Yeah. Um... come in. Oh, you like music? Yeah. I play, actually. Oh, wow. What do you play? Anything with strings. They let me have a guitar out in the yard. I'd love for you to come see me sometime. Is that your mom? Yeah. Oh, she's pretty. She was. I haven't seen her in six years. What happened? Prison. Just wears on people. Yeah, first couple years, she came every week, and then once a month, then... I'm sure she just moved on. I understand that. You have a big family? Yeah. We... We loved Sunday dinners. Loved watching baseball games. We all played music together. We were really close. I'm sure they miss you. I hope they do. There's something I want to ask you, and I know you're not supposed to around here. You want to know what I did? It's okay. I'd be curious, too. First-degree felony murder, aggravated robbery. Murder? Me and a buddy wanted to steal a car... turns out there was a guy sleeping in it. And my buddy had a gun... when the guy woke up, things got out of hand, and he shot him. I didn't kill anyone. Then why are you in here for murder? 'Cause felony murder's different. To get charged, you just have to be there. I'm not saying I'm innocent. I mean, I stole a guy's car, but I'm no killer. How long are you in here for? Life. Yeah. I was 17 and they tried me as an adult. I'm doing what I can to better myself. I got my G.E.D., taking some online classes. What did you want to do, before all this happened? Be a musician. Mm. Sounds ridiculous now. I should walk you out. You sorry you asked? No. I'm really glad you told me. People make mistakes, John. It's not my job to judge you. Everyone deserves a second chance. Hello? What? Okay, okay, slo... slow down. Okay, yeah, yeah, we're on the way. I love you. Okay. Uh... What's going on? My... My dad, he's in the hospital, and they're gonna take him to surgery and take out half his bladder... I don't... I don't know. I just got to get there. Where the heck is my beige sweater? Okay. I think it's bad, Pat. This could be it. He'll be fine. He's got very good doctors and he's at the right place. Okay, okay. All right, we just... we got to hurry. Come on, come on. You okay? Long night. Toby, I've never seen you like this. What's going on? Uh... my dad had emergency surgery last night and my family was there all night. I just came straight here. Is he gonna be okay? The surgery went well. He's stable, he's in I.C.U. He's got cancer. It's gonna kill him. I don't want my dad to die. Yeesh, I'm-I'm a mess. I'm sorry. Don't be. It's awful. I'm just glad you had your-your family, your husband there to support you. That's the point of marriage, isn't it? Well... the truth is... our marriage isn't perfect. Far from it. Why are you married to him? The second he asked that question, I realized I didn't have a good answer. It was like this gate had just opened up and shown me that there was a whole world right on the other side... if I could just find the courage to reach for it. I made my famous chicken. Do we have any soda? - There you go. - Thanks. Mm-hmm. I'd been unhappy in my marriage for a while. I just didn't know it, until I met John. How's your pops doing? Aw, he's okay. They sent him home early, a bit premature... but not much I can do about that. Thanks for asking. How you doing? Oh, great. I know you better than that. Honestly? I'm tired. Really? I mean, it makes sense, but you don't look it. It's probably that shirt, it's a good color on you. What? It's true. Geez. I'm just not used to... Compliments? A woman like you should be getting compliments all the time, especially at home... and if not, that's criminal. John, I... I just want you to know that my husband's not a bad guy. Look, the way I was raised... you don't complain. You just take what life gives you, and you make the most out of it. I may be the one behind bars, but it sounds to me like maybe you're the one who's not so free. I used to tell this story, to friends, family... whoever... about the time... my husband and I tried to make salsa. Big fiasco, it was all a mess, and it ended in hysterical laughter. But... it never happened. I made the whole thing up. I guess it's how I wanted my marriage to be. You deserve the moon, Toby Lynn. It's a beautiful name. You should... - Wanna walk me out? - Yeah. How are you doing, John? I know it's not easy in here. Better, now. Thanks to you. Toby Lynn was like this real-life angel. She was so good and so kind... and I don't think the people in her life appreciated her. You know what? That really pissed me off. Okay, so, what, you've never been drunk? You've never smoked a single cigarette? Nuh-uh. Why? Were you bad? Sometimes. Hey. Hey-hey-hey-hey! Come here. Yes! So wait, okay. So you've never looked at porn? Like, not even like a Playboy? No. Come on, man. Have you ever read any classic love story? It's better than porn. Yeah? I bet you there are a few guys in here that would probably disagree. Here's what I want you to do. I want you to go out, get yourself a bracelet that says "WWJD". What would Jesus... Not Jesus. John. "What would John do?" Every time you look at it, I want you to think to yourself... "What would John do?" Yeesh! I am so excited! I just found out that I get to bring six more dogs into the program! Oh, my g... are you proud of yourself? Yes, actually, I am. You escorting me around has just made me feel so safe. I hope you know how much I appreciate you. All this is possible because of your good heart. Is this okay? Yeah. You're so beautiful. Sorry. Oh, I shouldn't have done that. I'm so sorry. I'm not. I should really go home. It was like we were two teenagers falling in love. Come on. Good boy. Good boy. Hey! Hey. Good boy. Yeah. Oh, lipstick today, huh? Yeah. I'm trying something new. Pat likes it, too. Nice. Spicing things up a little bit? Good for you. Mm-hmm. All right, guys. Today, we're gonna work on... John was around Toby all the time. All the time. My radar was going off a little bit, yep, but Mom's diverticulitis was flaring up, and I could not be around that often. That was not my choice. I wanted to be there, but, um, no, I really had no idea what was going on. I mean, nobody did. Toby, I'm gonna throw these in the car. All right. You look so good out there, it's driving me crazy. I just wish I could dress you up and take you out for a fancy dinner. You'd wear a red dress, I'd wear a suit. They can't hear us from here. Yeah, you're probably right. I would love to wear a dress for you. I have an idea. A way that we can talk all the time and not worry. Costs 500 bucks to get a cell phone smuggled in here. It's against the rules. Yeah, lots of guys have them. We could talk all the time. $500 is a lot of money, though. They don't search everything that you bring in in the van, do they? No. I just want your voice to be the last thing that I hear when I fall asleep at night. I'm really falling for you, Toby Lynn. After that, things started to move quickly. Hon? You seen my reading glasses? Uh... I think they're on your nightstand. Found 'em. - Hey, John. - Hey. Could you help me get this food inside? Sure. Okay. No. Not that one. Hello? Oh, hi. And, at night, we'd still be together, talking on the phone. You know... I have made my own coffee every darn morning, and sometimes, I want someone to make it for me. What was the happiest moment of your life? Yeah, I know what you mean. If you were to die tomorrow... what would you most regret? What would make a perfect day for you? Truth is, I never felt that close to anyone in my entire life. In one month, we talked 12,000 minutes on the phone. Yeah, real slow and gentle, baby. I want it to be like I'm the one touching you. 12,000 minutes didn't feel like enough. Hey, um... why don't you two take him out and let him burn off some of his extra energy? - I'll be out soon. - All right. It's too risky. I just keep thinking about our little cabin in the woods. I'd make you coffee every morning. Hey, uh... I need to ask you something. Something... Something serious. If I wasn't in here, if I was just a normal guy on the outside... would you be with me? I think I would. Oh! You just made me the happiest man in the world. Yeah? Why's that? 'Cause I love you. I hope you know that by now. I love you, too. Yeah? Okay. - Hey. - Hey, Dad. I brought you some goodies. Some mystery novels. Oh, thank you. Some pistachios... and I brought you some of that root beer you like. My guardian angel. How you feeling? Is there anything I can do to make you more comfortable? I'm fine. I'm thinking about heading out for a round of golf in a bit. Oh, shoot. Yeah, I should've got you a straw. I'm sorry. No, it's fine. It happens all the time. How do you do it, Dad? You've been through so much, how do you stay so upbeat? Well, what choice do I have? Life is short, hon. We aren't promised anything. You can't take anything for granted. You got to enjoy every bit of life you get. Hmm? - Hey. - Hey. You cooking dinner? I'm starving. Yeah. I've just got to go to the bathroom, then I'll get it started. "Hey, baby. I love you." Who the heck is this? It's a wrong number. You know, I keep getting these calls about some warranty that's about to expire. Makes me wonder who had this darn number before me. You didn't think I was... That you were having an affair? I think you, of all people, aren't capable of something like that, right? I think about you every second. I wish I could just hold your hand. I wish I could do more than that. Me too. There's a way we can. Just got to bust me out of here. Yeah, right. Good learning. That's a good boy. We'd find a little cabin someplace quiet. Nobody would find us. Just think of all the fun we'd have. Geez, that would be fun. Maybe I could find a way to climb the fence. I think the electric wire would have something to say about that. Maybe I could find a way to smuggle myself in one of the food delivery trucks. The guards check those with the heartbeat monitors. Love always finds a way. At first, when John talked about breaking out... to me, it was just this silly game. I was dead serious. What's up, Hooligan? You ain't eating? Nah. Your skinny ass looks like crap, man. What's up? Nothin'. He was like... I'll just say it... he was like a dog with a bone. - Hey. - Hi, Mr. Jenkins. Can you, uh... can you do something about these? They're everywhere, they're starting to pile up. Yeah, sure. You know what, I could actually load these up on the wagon, and take them out to the front gate, so we wouldn't have to drag them through the unit. Yeah. Good. Thank you. This is it. There's no way you could fit in there. My body can do all kinds of things. I figured out what my new name's gonna be. It's "Mark West". Sexy, right? We just gotta figure out what your new name's gonna be. It's Molly Rose. People ask me this all the time... "What was the plan?" Well... the plan was that John and I would, um... run away for a couple months and then I would get to come back to my life. I could be all the "Molly Rose" I created and the good parts of Toby Young. It all felt like fun and games at first. All of the sudden, it was very, very real. I cleaned out mine and Pat's retirement savings. I'm, uh, Molly Rose. Nice to meet you. Is this, uh, big enough? Yeah. This will work. There you go. Thank you. I called a place in Tennessee about the cabin we want... it's very private, they assured me. John, be careful about using your phone. I am. Listen. The first count's at ten, next count's at three... that's our window. What if your cell mate says something? Nobody's gonna snitch. Trust me. I trust you. Holy crap. That's this week. We have to do this now. This is our best chance. Okay. Bye. I wanted to be with her more than anything I'd ever wanted. I wanted to be with him more than anything I've ever wanted. We've been over everything, baby. We're ready. If I don't show up at the pet adoption, Deb will sound the alarm. We'll be long gone by then. This is about us and no one else. I don't think I can do this. This time tomorrow, nobody's gonna be able to stop me from kissing you, hugging you, loving you. We'll get to live like real people. You and me, Toby Lynn. We belong together. Do you mean that? More than anything. Burning the midnight oil? Yeah, just trying to finish it up. Eh, I think I'm gonna turn in. All right, goodbye. I mean, goodnight. Wow, I'm tired. Goodnight. Please pick up. Please, please, please pick up. Hey. You've reached Adam. Leave a message and I'll call you back. Hi, Adam. It's Mom. Uh... just, uh, wanted to see how you're doing, and, um... let you know I was thinking about you. I love you. That's all. I hope I didn't wake you up. Um... Big kiss. I hope you ace that midterm this week. Talk soon. 'Kay? I love you. Darnel? Yeah. Whoo! It's freezing out here. I should've dressed warmer, huh? Mateo? Yep. John? Yo. - Terry? - Yo. Thank you. Here you go. Hey, man, have you seen the wagon? We're supposed to load this stuff up and take it down to the gate for Toby. That's the first I heard of it. Uh... I'll go see. Thanks. How's it going? Hey. How are you doing, Damian? Adoption day? Yeah, yeah, a lot of great dogs getting adopted. Kids keep begging me to get 'em one. Ah. Let me know if you get any beagles or border collies. Of course. You okay? Oh, yeah. All right, great. Thanks, guys. All right, great, thank you. All right. See ya. Pop the trunk, please. It's your lucky day. Hope you get adopted. I think you're good. Okay, thanks. John? Are you there? John, are you there? Okay. Okay. It worked! - Oh, my gosh. - I can't believe it! We're like Bonnie and Clyde, like real outlaws! I'm scared, John. Don't be, baby! We planned for this. - You brought a ukulele! - Yeah. Okay. So we're going to the storage unit. Okay, so how far away is the storage? Well, it's... we have go to my house first and drop off the dogs. Pat's at work. What? No. Well, just let them out here, Toby. No, I'm not gonna dump 'em on the side of the road! Toby, every second counts right now! My house is not that far, okay? Fine. Oh, god. Hurry up. Jesus. Yes, I'll be quick. Just... Just stay out of sight, okay? All right. I gotcha. You're gonna be okay. Okay. Here, sweet girl. Here you go. Yeah, good girl. Yeah. I'm gonna miss you guys. Drive, drive, drive. If I start kissing you, I'm not gonna be able to stop. We've gotta get outta here. Okay. Here, let me help you. Okay. I'm gonna hang on to this for safe keeping. Oh, my god. What... Are those... Are those Pat's guns? Why? We shouldn't have those. It's for protection. No. Are you out of your mind? I'm protecting us, Toby! Oh, I don't like this. I don't like it at all. You wouldn't like getting robbed either. We have thousands of dollars of cash here. We don't have time for this. Give me the keys. I'm driving. Oh, my God! I can still drive! It's been ten years and I can still drive. It feels freaking amazing! Oh. Oh... Okay, I almost forgot. Oh, yeah. This is old man hair. I'm not an old man. What? That's what makes it a disguise. I'm not wearing this. We're gonna have to get something else, something cooler. No, John. Listen. Would you go for a guy with hair like that? I don't... I don't know. Ah? You hesitated. Here, give me the baseball cap. That'll do for now. Did you get those snacks I asked you for? I did. Oh, my God! Okay. Mm! - It's you and me, Molly! - Yes. Joey? Simon? Darnel? Yeah. That's better. Mateo? Yo. John? John? Where's John? Everyone in! Lockdown! Now! Let's go! Get in there! Move it! Move it! No! No, look. Inmates don't just disappear. Okay? Somebody knows something. Yes. My guys had eyes on him this morning. Uh, Damian? - What? - Um... John had permission to be in the storage room, right? To get rid of some old stuff and some old dog crates? Dog crates? Yeah. I mean, who would've guessed, right? I mean, he was so freakin' tall. How the hell can you fit inside that thing and bend the way he... I guess 'cause he's young... and he's... flexible, so. Captain Young speaking. My wife? Yeah, I saw her leave this morning, why? What's going on? Shawnee National Forest, six miles. Do I take the I-60, or the 110? Uh... I-60 or the 110, baby? No, I swear, I printed it up, on my desktop. You can't find the directions? No, no, it's here, somewhere. Toby, you were in charge of directions. - That was your job. - I know, I know. Listen, the next place we pass, I'll just... I'll hop out and ask. You'll just "hop out and ask"? This isn't a family vacation, Toby! I know! I'm sorry! This is... Do you know how serious this is? I just broke out of prison, you remember? Get your head in the game, Toby. God! I wandered around I finally found Somebody who Could make me Be tru-u-ue I'm so sorry. I shouldn't have yelled out my ass like that. I'm so mad at myself. I'm just so tired and anxious to get where we're going, so we can be together. I know this is scary. You're everything to me. Do you forgive me? Lucky number nine. Look at the moon. It's like it came out just for us. Lighting our way to our new life. Look at this place! It's a palace. It's our palace. And it comes with a queen. Ah... I can't believe this is really happening. Turns out good sex is just like a drug, isn't it? I mean, I've never actually done drugs, but, um, I mean, I can imagine. Morning, sleepyhead. Ahh. Good morning. Afternoon, actually. We exhausted ourselves last night. - Mm. - Ohh... Where are you going? A quick store run. Oh, wait. What? You said we have to lay low. Well, we do, but we also need supplies. I haven't been out there in ten years. It'll be like an amusement park for me. Mm. Mm... Maynard is believed to have escaped inside of a cargo van used by the prison's "Always Loved" dog adoption program. The owner of the van, Toby Young, is also missing. Could you stop crunching those damn things? What can I say? I'm a stress-eater. It's unknown if it could be a hostage situation, or if Young somehow aided in the inmate's escape. You know, I think I've had about enough of this. I'm just gonna head home. Oh, let me pack you some food. No, no, just you sit and try to relax. I know you've been up all night, too. We'll just keep praying. We've got to keep faith. Ah, check this out! Oh, let's see it. You're gonna love it. You can't wear that. Why not? My hair was long when I was arrested. I look like Jerry Cantrell. Alice in Chains? Best rock guitarist in history? Okay. You're gonna stand out and men don't wear their hair like that anymore. I do. Don't be ridiculous. Take it off. Mm. Mm... oh, woman. You weren't kidding. This is the best thing I've ever tasted. Next to you. - Yeah, you like it? - I love it. I mean, I could eat this every night. Are you not gonna eat anything? John, can I ask you something? Yeah. What if someone spots us? What if we get... Caught? You're not gonna get in into any trouble. 'Cause we're gonna say that I kidnapped you. I don't want you to think about that, okay? That's not gonna happen. Well, what if it does? I have been waiting my whole life to meet a woman like you. I'm not letting anyone take you away from me. Come on, are you seriously not hungry? I'm just enjoying watching you. Mm! Mm. So is this how you pictured it? Being out? Well... I never imagined it before you. So, no. It's even better. Captain Young, when was the last time that you heard from your wife? Are you worried about her safety? Did your wife conspire to help John Maynard escape prison? Hey! You guys need to back off. This is private property. Anything suspicious in her behavior the last few days? More time at the pris... Sir! We want to help tell your side of the story! Go! Away! How original. U.S. Marshal Service! Open the door. Right now. - Captain Young? - Yes. I'm Deputy U.S. Marshal Blake. This is Detective Roberts. May we come in? Did you notice anything unusual about Toby's behavior in the days leading up to the 12th? No. Nothing I can remember. Has your wife ever had an affair? I'm sorry. It's just... if you knew Toby, you'd know that wasn't a possibility. And why's that? It's just not her style. Why? What am I missing? We have surveillance footage of her on the 8th at a local pharmacy. She bought a wig and an electric razor, and she was talking on the phone the whole 30 minutes that she was in there. Was she talking to you? Um, no, I-I... I don't think so. I mean, we usually keep our conversations short. You know, "I'll be there in ten," stuff like that. Anything missing from the home? Game over. Don't worry about me. I like puzzles. You enjoy your game. I'm worried about me. Come sit on my lap. I mean it. "Molly," come here now. I want you close to me at all times. You understand? Yeah. Look what you made me do. Guess you'll just have to teach me a lesson. Over the last few days, it has become clear that this was a well-planned effort on the part of Mrs. Young to aid and assist in the escape of John Maynard. Both are still at large and both should be considered armed and dangerous. If anyone watching this comes into contact with either of these individuals... please contact law enforcement. When I told her to live her life, this isn't exactly what I meant. Nope. I didn't know. I knew nothing. I did not see this coming. I had no idea. I am her best friend. She normally would have told me, but you know. A whole other side of Toby. So... Sit down. Okay. I wrote you a song. I haven't written a song in a long time. Don't think I could have resisted you Don't think there's nothing That this body could do Heaven made an angel Through and through Someone gets to love you I think I do it well The man Wants to take me away Lock me up And throw away the key But I'm fine Oh, I'm fine 'Cause you're mine All the time Oh, John. That is beautiful. I just want you to know I love you, Toby Lynn. I wasn't living before you came along. I was just existing. You're this bright light that makes everything possible. What's wrong? It's... absolutely perfect. It's the most romantic thing anyone has ever done for me. It won't be the last. - No peeking, now. - I'm not. Where did you get bubblebath? I made it out of shampoo. Now I want to give you something. You have. You've given me all this. There is this guitar shop over in Nashville. We could go tomorrow and be extra-careful. John had been locked up for so long, he wanted to see the world. I just can't pick between the two. Take both. Nah, baby, that's too much money. Would it make you happy? Then take both. We could always sell one if we need the money. I mean, what's the point of being free if you can't experience a little? John had never spent a day of his adult life outside of jail. He didn't understand practicality, and, well, I'd spent my whole darn life being practical. I thought "I deserve to be a little frivolous." Oh! It's beautiful. I got it for you, 'cause I knew that you love having something to take care of. Oh. What should we name her? His name is "Lynyrd"... after Lynyrd Skynyrd, who wrote "Free Bird," 'cause that's me... I'm a free bird. Well, I think we should name him "Franklin". You're not naming the bird. I am, and his name is Lynyrd. But I don't like that name. Don't think that you can tell me what to do. I'm not your loser husband! Mark West! You listen to me! I will not let you speak to me that way. Get over here. Get! Over here. You will show me some respect. I did not do all of this just so that you could treat me like crap. All right? How dare you scare this poor little bird? You'll start acting like a grown-up, right now. I'm sorry, Molly. You're right. All of it... the fighting, the loving, the emotion... it made me feel so darn alive. Of course, it was screwed up, but... the more time I spent with him, the more I could predict his moods. I've never heard this one. One minute, he was loving and affectionate, and the next minute... And I liked feeling something... until... until it all got very real. John, look. Look. Oh, my God. - Oh, my God. - Baby, look at me. It says I'm a criminal. - Geez. - Look at me. Don't let them in your head. That's what they want. Come on. Well... here's our van. Probably had a getaway car stored here. No security cameras? Planning to get them next month. I mean, it's not like we're dealing with criminal masterminds here. Toby... if-if you're listening... we love you, and we... and we just want you to come home. Captain Young, WCZ News. Captain Young! Captain Young! Was your marriage in trouble? Captain Young, TZU News. Is it true your wife was having an affair with John Maynard? Captain Young, care to comment? Yeah. Uh-huh. Thank you. No. Thank you. Well, we have an address. A car salesman just told me that she bought a gray SUV from him. It's registered to a cabin in Alpine, Tennessee... a vacation rental. She sent the registration to an actual address. Uh-huh, yeah. That wasn't great. Turns out, she wasn't much of a criminal. U.S. Marshals! Must have just missed them. Crazy bird. Well... Looks like somebody's been shopping. Neighboring cabin. Said they headed out about two hours ago. Oh, my God! I just can't get over how real the I-Max was. I mean, the screen was so big. It was... It was like we were in an actual African safari. I'm really glad you liked it. I loved it, baby. That was so much fun. It was such a good idea. Oh. Oh, there's a... a bookstore. I just want to see if they have this one book, okay? Mark? Mark? Mark! Ah! What, Molly? You scared me. It's not funny. Go on. Shh. Be quiet. I can't believe you've never read Where the Red Fern Grows. Well, if the dog dies, I won't like it. Oh, trust me. Fan out. Hit the stores. See if anyone recognizes the vehicle or the picture. Well, that's them. Suspects are on the move, heading east, gray SUV. Go, go, go, go! They must be doing construction back there. It's so bright. Yeah? No, baby. That's for us. Oh, my God. What do we do? You're in this too, so I'll do whatever you want me to do. If they tell you to pull over, then you should pull over... it's the law. If that's what you want me to do. Oh, crap. Hey, geez! Come on! What are you doing, man? What are you doing? What the hell, man! They're trying to kill us! That son of a bitch! I'm not gonna let him get away with this! Slow down! Slow down. Slow down! They're not getting away with this! Oh, no! Oh, no! No! No... No... John! Slow down! Oh, no! Out of the vehicle! Out of the vehicle! Hands in the air! Come on, look at me. - You okay? - Yeah. Okay, I love you. Hey, hey, hey, come on, man. I'm unarmed. I'm unarmed, man! She's innocent.! I kidnapped her, okay? I kidnapped her. Ah! my shoe. Grab my shoe. You're not going to the ball, Cinderella. Hey. Let her have her damn shoe. Toby! John! Toby... John! - I love you. - I love you! Officer, um, at the cabin, there's a bird, and please just tell the others that he's in there, he's loose and... if something happened to him, I would just never forgive myself. Please... please! So, I was thinking, "This woman has no idea how much trouble she's in." But... I, of course, did go get that bird. Renamed him "Maynard". Everybody in the office loves having him around. Real morale-booster. One small silver lining... I did get that darn divorce I wanted after all. Look, I'm neither mentally nor emotionally prepared to comment right now. All right? Captain Young, we just want your side of the story. I let so many people down. Especially my father and my son. He's still not talking to me. I don't know if he ever will. Everybody kept pushing me to say that John forced me or brainwashed me, but I wasn't going to say that. I knew, if I took on the role of a victim, that I would never be anything else for the rest of my life. All I wanted was to be liberated. And in the strangest way in the world, I was. I met an angel who, for some reason, graced me with her love. This isn't the end of our story... not if I have anything to say about it. Would I do it all again? No way. And cut! Great job today, Toby.
