DEDICATED TO THAT BIG PIECE OF SHIT OF MY FATHER (WITH GREAT CANDOR) TO SENDER IF NOT DELIVERED Claudio! Claudio, please. - You scared me. - What is it, my old man? I thought you were ill. You pushed the bell. When I put down the book... - Claudio, don't ever do it again! - Sorry. Did you get scared? - Pretty much. - Yes, but you risk killing me. I tried, Claudio. How are you? I felt a lot better before. Me too. Rest, Claudio. Good morning. Mr. Giulio, everything is ready in the kitchen! Breakfast is on the tray. Send my regards to Mr. Claudio! I'm leaving, have a nice day! Thank you, too, Mrs. Gina. See you tomorrow. How is Claudio today? He says hello. - Tired? - No, I'm not tired, Claudio. - Good. We must run. - Sure, Claudio, we must run. But without hurrying. I decided last night. What? Tell me what you decided, Claudio. Tell me. I want to go down. - What do you mean? - The roses need me. Claudio, the roses are in excellent health. - Really? - They're a lot better off than us. Look. She leads me... Don't worry. Say hello, say hello to Claudio. Hi! No, I care more about Claudio. Yes, you too, but... - She is saying she's fond of you. - Huh? - She is fond of you. - Oh, thanks. I care for Claudio too. You see? She leads me. So, Claudio, which should I eliminate? - This one? - Not this one yet. It doesn't look very good. So... - This one. - Not that one yet. This one is bad off, isn't it? You're wrong. You don't know roses. She will perk up. This one? Darn. I don't know! Maybe so. I understand. No victim today either. Tomorrow, dear roses, one of you... will disappear. Let me find her outside. Please don't make me waste time. Right, Claudio? Who doesn't love flowers, doesn't love enough. How lovely. Poetic! Good for you, Claudio. I have never thrown them away. I always stick them back. I'll stick them back. What do you think? Here, Claudio. - No, I'll do it. - I'll do it. I'll do it. - How are you, Claudio? - And you? - Oh, I'm fine. - I'm fine too. - The pains? - What kind of croissants are they? With walnut cream, delicious. - And what's in here? - Mariuccia's "dolcemirto". - I'll eat now. - Here. Goodbye. See you tomorrow, Mr. Giulio. Good morning, Mr. Giulio. How are you? Just wonderful. Mr. Claudio? He says hello, dear Antonio. - How is your father? - Much better, thank you. Here are your groceries. Thank you. Tell him to hurry. I miss him. No, Antonio, don't tell him that. I'm sure that in 10 days we see him jumping around pebbles again. "Las ginquetas". - Right, Antonio? - Oh, yes! Good-day, Mr. Giulio, how are you? - Well, it seems. - Seems like it, but I always doubt. And how is Mr. Claudio? - Did I say it well? - Tell him I said hello too. Good bye. Good bye. - Excuse me. - Good morning. Good morning, sir. My name is Valeria Santelia. My pleasure. I was expecting you. Let's go that way. With pleasure. Why a marriage in my estate? Aristotle said a wonderful phrase, "The life that..." Can I recite a rhyme that just came to my mind in all this vegetation? - Certainly. - Promise you won't laugh? You have my word. "Do you hear the sound of the woods? It's the grass and plants making love. Come on! It can't be a noise! Certainly. And then flowers are born, and then fruits. From nests that interweave, life flourishes. That is the noise." That is the reason. The music? Have them play Chopin. Say yes. Certainly, a waltz. Opera 69 number 2. - It's beautiful. I adore that piece. - So do we. - So, it's okay? - Certainly. Why not? - Excuse me. - Please. Hi. No, I'm leaving. Time. Why not? Everything. I pass. What shitty luck! Not even with a full house of Queens. - Guys, I'm out. Enough. - Marco, your cell phone. My mother at this hour? Excuse me. Hello? Hi. No, we're taking a break. What? He's ill? Alright, okay. Kiss. It seems that my granddad is ill. Which of the two? The poker one? - So you're returning to Sardinia? - Tomorrow morning. - Lucky you! - Are you worried? A little. My grandfather hadn't called my mother in years. - Bye, guys. - Bye! Hi, Dad. May we come in? Of course. - Hi, Marco. How are you? - Hi, Granddad. I'm fine. How are you? Fine. Come. - Why is the furniture all covered? - To avoid the dust. So we avoid... Anyway... Marco, Valeria. Let's move to the office. What for? - Various reasons. - Claudio? Claudio... - He's upstairs. - How long has he been ill? Almost eight years. - Marco! Marco... - Granddad. - Tell me, did you hurt yourself? - No. Where is Valeria? Valeria. I'll explain. Wait, Valeria. Let me explain. I want to explain! I can explain everything, Valeria. Come on. Let's see what he makes up, this piece of... Mom! But we can't sit down. Where will we sit down? Does some chair still exist, or did you sell everything? I had to, Valeria. I had to. - Oh, you had to. - Yes. - You lost playing poker, huh? - No, poker has no part in it. - It has nothing to do with it. - Oh, God. You sold everything. The hotel? I don't believe it. Please, tell me it's not true. - My God. Do you realize that? - Let's try to understand. Yes, let's try to understand. You called me because you need money. No. I didn't call you for money. No. - It seems impossible that you... - That you what, Dad? If you tell Claudio what you saw, I swear that... Go on. I'll kill you. Then I'll cry it out. Valeria, where are you going? Come here. I must explain, Valeria. - Why? - You don't age. You don't age. You're always the same. No. No, Marco... She is always the same. She doesn't say anything. I know her. Do you mind if I go to the bathroom? Go on. Go on. I won't find a cardboard toilet, will I? A cardboard toilet. Maybe. Tell me about him. - What do you say about him? - Claudio. How are you? Please, tell me how you are. It's nothing, just a moment. I'll overcome it. He makes it seem serious. - What do you say about him? - What is wrong with you? Nothing. A bizarre illness. We'll talk about it later. - Valeria, you didn't answer. - Again? - Yes! - What do I say about him? He's in great shape, but always a piece of shit. Valeria, I won't allow you to use that language. - You're talking about your father. - You're right. Besides, I'm not here for my father. I am here for you. We are here for you. Marco is here. God, please have him come up! Later. I want to know about you now. I am very worried, Claudio. - It's nothing. - What do you mean? Even your voice. I have a sore throat. Believe me. Did I ever lie to you? - Never? - Never. - What did Marco say about him? - How can you... - "How can you" what? - I adore you. I want to talk to the doctors. - You made a vow. - That I'd never gamble again. But it didn't work. Can you tell me what's wrong with Granddad Claudio? He just needs everyone, not just me. Just think. The other day I didn't hear the "beep". - I fell asleep. - What does that mean? Yes, what does that mean? Is the money really all gone? Living off of the interest was no longer enough. And expenses... It's all recorded. How is the situation? How much are we in the red? Look. My God, Dad. It's a lot of money. Does the hotel have a mortgage? But don't worry. I spoke to a man in the bank a few days ago. The people I knew are no longer there. But that young man seemed like a lovely person. - He says not to worry. - A lovely person? Banks don't kid around. They'll take it from you, Dad. - I told them Claudio was ill. - Oh, sure. Where do you live? I'll talk to the young man tomorrow and see how serious things are. You must tell me the situation. What's the situation with Claudio? Not well, Valeria. He moves very little. And he has problems with light. I just want him to feel good, and that he lacks nothing. We all want that. Yes... I want it more than anyone. Understand? No. You must not say that, Dad. It can't be. I am not ready yet. I need more time, understand? Time, Valeria. We waste so much time. I wasted so much of it. Time. Excuse me! I was looking for my granddaddy. Marco! Come here, my dear. - What do you say about him? - He's a bulldozer. - He's in good shape, huh? - Yes, very much. - He so much deserves it. - And what do we deserve? - The two of us? - No. You! Why didn't you have your queen come? It's a particular moment. Being apart doesn't... In a few words? We drifted apart a bit. What's the atmosphere like below? A polite table of discussion. Valeria, tell me. What do you say about him? You're saying that too? I'm going to prepare the two rooms. They're ready. If you want, we can eat something in the kitchen. I will eat alone. Thanks, but I would have gone down. - It's a pleasure. - So you didn't sell everything? TO SENDER IF NOT DELIVERED I BREATHED WHAT IS MISSING I will continue loving you, even from a distance. I will try to steal those small drops that emerge from the perspiration of gestures, or of other people's talks, to find out how life is treating you. I will continue thinking of you, even if I'm alone. I will try to embroider the small things that remain, maybe in the gestures or in the moments spent, to find out how much about you I understood. And you... and you, Valeria. You will never understand. No. That is not why I am crying, and I am not suffering. In fact... if you don't even see me, I am happy. Because I like love. Yes, I like love. And love is discreet. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I am late because I ran into Alberto. Remember Alberto? He says hello and says to call him. He'd like to see you again. Shall we go inside? In six month the eviction will be carried out. - What the shit! - Marco. They had said... It wasn't enough to know that Claudio is ill. They are banks! Alberto... Where did you see him? - At the port. - Take me to him. Word is going around that he got clobbered at the table. So I imagined. Alberto, I want to open the hotel again. Even if the rooms are few, the position is fantastic. We must think of something. There is very little time. I need investors. - And your work? - I'll take a break. I need one, even if it won't be easy. The only person who comes to my mind, is... The admiral could give you a hand. He's pleasant, full of money. I met him a short while ago. His boat is here on the dock. We could ask him. Try asking him. Thanks. I'm sorry, but I must go now. Marco is waiting for me. And how are you? Fine. Always on the alert, but fine. - Your work? - Maybe it's the only thing going well. I spent a fantastic period in Paris, which I adore. When Marco finishes his Master, maybe he'll get settled... and I'll think about it. And love? I never understood a shit about it. I think I tasted it, but I wasn't able to get to the flavor. - How's it going with you? - Specialized in sunsets. - Every day, same place for years. - Come on! You should see 2015. It's spectacular! 363 sunsets, because I lost two... incredible poetry. 51 completely gray skies, heavy with emotion. 86 that go from azure to a more intense light blue. 226 different tones that go from antique pink to purple red. You must look at them in a rapid succession. Here we are. Look how lovely. Fantastic. And this is my passion. Photography. Look at this one. May. You know what I think? That in the end he chose me to double. To double? To put what he didn't put. If I hadn't had you, how would I have grown up? Tell me that. They are automatic roles, my little one. Him around the world winning money to spend with us. No. With you, to spend with you! - But you were always after us. - Right, not with you. You should... I should respect someone who never worked in his life? Someone who lived by taking away money from others? The attorney... If only he had been one! Anyway, are you sure he doesn't gamble anymore? No, I'm not sure. Then that is what we must talk about. - Because I think... - I think he does. He gambles mentally. Mentally. I assure you, Valeria. He stopped gambling. In fact, that is the problem. We must have him play. Valeria, listen... I am sure the money is gone. I know how much we had, and I know how much he spent for me... during these years. One game is enough. If the request comes from you... a vow. No. You can't ask me that. There must be another solutions, Christ! We're talking about betting with money to have more money. Absurd. There must be other solutions. I want to look for those. - Alright. - It all seems so absurd. Anyway, we'll find a way, and let's forget about poker. It is his work, Valeria. He's always done it as a job, whether you like that or not. It wasn't a vice. It never was. Why don't you tell him? That the reason isn't just poker. What are you waiting for? Is there something in particular you'd like to eat? Pasta with "pecorino" cheese and butter... lots of pecorino. I've been desiring it for years. Forget it. I want a nice lunch! - I cook, and I decide. - Democratic. Come on. What would you like? Pasta with pecorino cheese and butter. - Can you eat it? - Sure. - So have someone make it for you. - I can't. Those Maricaretti he prepares... How can I ask for pasta with butter? CONFISCATED PREMISES Valeria, come on. He's waiting for us. How did you hear me? I was very quiet. You entered my dream and I woke up, as Giulio does. And what is Granddad Giulio's dream? He never said it, but that is his dream. Buy the home where you were born? Yes, the historical center. But that is a dream for you. What about for him? - I dream. - What do you dream for him? A game. We must have him play. The satisfaction of straightening everything up. The only person who can convince him... is you. How can I? You must be convincing. Think about it, Marco. The problem is serious. I don't think it's right that your mom should take the burden. Good morning. Good morning. What do you want? The admiral. I am Alberto. He's waiting for us. - Good morning. - Good morning. Good morning. - Is he the admiral? - Yes, why? What's going on? Good morning, Valeria. - Do you know each other? - Unfortunately. Hi, Eugenio. He is one of dad's friends, a "gambling house keeper". Can one say "gambling house keeper"? Of course you can, but you can't prove it. I am not forcing anyone to play. Now he has people call him "admiral". It came about because of the boat. - Alberto explained it to me. - I don't want your money. Alberto talked to me about serious people. - Do you mind if we leave? - Alright. Valeria! I won't offer you my money. There are serious entrepreneurs who invest if it's convenient. Clean money. I won't even enter. If Mom asked you, would you play a game? - Everything changes, Marco. - She has changed too. We talked a lot about it these days. Sure. She could never ask you. I... Consider me her loudspeaker. Nobody is to know, not even her. You're not bluffing, are you? - Swear it. - Of course. I swear. Even if I wanted, Marco, I am out of practice. I'm here. Use me, so you may teach me something too. Forget it, Marco. Forget it. The first thing I usually do, Marco, is look them straight in the eyes. It just takes a few seconds, you know? Not to understand, but to instill a good, healthy sense of arrogance. Master Claudio. Master Claudio. Good morning, Master Claudio. What are you doing? Me too, throat, throat hurts, throat hurts! You, in Italy. Rain, rain, wind. Us in Nairobi, never rain, wind, never, never. Sun, sun, sun. Always sun, sun, sun! Night and day, Master Claudio! - Giulio, you're extraordinary. - Giulio who? Me, Giulio? No. Me, Sam, not Giulio. - Master Claudio. - I can't laugh anymore, my love. - Leave me like this. - Are you tired of me? - No, not of you. - And of what? I am tired of myself. I'm sorry, Master Claudio. - Let me sleep. - Yes, sleep. You make me laugh! Thank heavens! I like it when you laugh. It's an enormous pleasure when you laugh. I laugh because... Why do I laugh? Claudio! He's better. Yes, today Claudio is better. Claudio! Do you feel better? Yes. Today Claudio feels better. Today Claudio feels better. How's it going? Things will work out, in one way or another. You always say that. When I was a child I came to hide here. I spent a lot of time here. - They couldn't find you? - They didn't look for me. Let's go. What was Aristotle's phrase, for the Knight? I don't know. - You mean you didn't know it? - No. Mom, the rhyme was prepared. You bluffed. Marco, I must sell the projects. And if they like spontaneity, I must invent it! Valeria, Valeria! They're looking for you today. Valeria, is Marco with you? Not this time either. Come in. Are we disturbing? Hey, Claudio! Let's say you're not. Listen. I had an idea. I was talking to Valeria about it. - She agrees. - Well? I thought of going for a trip and maybe sleeping out. Huh? - Why not? - With Marco, our grandson. With me? I would be pleased if you accompanied me. Certainly, I'd like that. I thought of going out too, this morning, to meet some friends. But you're putting me on the spot like this. Why? You pick who you want to go with, freely. Let's see... I choose Granddad Giulio, I'm sorry. Why are you sorry? I am glad. I'll take advantage to avoid going down. Why don't you both get out of the way? Marco, let's get out of the way. Come on. Granddad, what is that dark spot? Cufflinks. And good luck token. The suit. You really don't like to play? I don't play, Marco, I don't play. I win. Speaking to myself. In a loud voice. And from the inside. Is it really necessary? To comprehend. You listen to yourself, Marco... and understand lots of things. You explain them to yourself. And are the first. I will miss him. My great friend. What a pleasure. -How wonderful to see you here again. -It's wonderful for me too, Eugenio. A few weeks ago I saw Valeria. She is beautiful. What does Valeria say? She says she hates me. Eugenio, did the surprise arrive? With the 5 p.m. flight! - What are you doing here? - I am here. Do you play poker, Elisabetta? A little. Marco taught me, but I can never win with him. And you can also hear it very well. You met my husband. - Excuse me? - Carlo Francesco Demartis. Do you think Granddad is favored? A new attorney hasn't been born yet! During these days, in my little room, I went over a great part of the way. And what is the answer to the question your dad always asks? How did life treat you? Things went fairly well. In fact, they went well. With the exception of sentiments and surroundings. Since the arrival of Aunt Valerose's inheritance... I meant, all downhill, or am I mistaken? Right. Your father never had a sister. She wasn't his sister? - Was she his lover? - No! Claudio, was she your sister? No. I never had a sister, either. - What are you trying to say? - "Vale" was given by your father. I gave "Rose". Valrose. Tell me it isn't true. Valeria, I'm trying to have you understand that someone always tried to be close to you. Be close to me? You didn't want anything from us. So your dad made up the inheritance. You must smile. Valeria, my love. You must smile. Is it true you have the same dreams? It happens. - It can happen once in a while. - Nearly always. Believe me, it was the only way, because he was really good. But he had realized you cheated. Oh, yes. I have an excellent memory of him. And I hope that life treated him well. That woman is very particular. Donna Maria. She has been asking me for a while to convince Giulio to play. She is crying out revenge. Is she good? For some time now she's had a lot of winnings. But, as many women, she won't like interrupting it. But it's not the most worrisome thing, right? There are two, her and that guy without a tie. And he is good? Yes, but he gives too much value to money. And on these tables, it is a limit. I heard he plays for a lot of money. It will be a beautiful game. - We're going to the cafe. - Sure. Friends, we are ready. Good cards to all of you. A scandal for drugs... But you were too young to remember. - Jail? - No, got off the hook. But disgrace and closed doors! - You became a director, anyway. - And I am one, every day. But do you dream? Expectations? He is still handsome, huh? - What? - Oh, come on! Dad has never been handsome. You see him as handsome, but it's the contrary. You mean ugly? Not really ugly, but just a little. And I am not referring to his nose in particular. We should reconsider your concept of beauty, my dear. I don't think he has any vice. Give me the name of a handsome man. In fact, an actor of your days. Alain Delon, there! Is Delon handsome? I would say so. He was. Well, he's still a handsome man. Very well. I perfectly agree. Can't you see this coherence in your father? I see all of the coherence. In fact, your father is more coherent than him. I am getting lost. Should the concept of coherence be considered again? I am not an idiot. No, but where do you see coherence in Dad? Your father was handsome as a young man, and now that he's older he's even more handsome. And to be sincere, I find your father to be more fascinating. - I fully agree. - Finally. No, shit! Why is he playing? He has two 8s. Let him be. Couples bring poker. I don't know why, but he often plays that couple. I've sometimes seen him play it four times in a row. - And always in pots with relaunches. - Very informed. I know all the games you recorded, by heart. - Granddad sent them to me. - Were they useful to you? So-so. I often lose. Why do you lose? I don't know. The people I play with, manage to upset any theory. They win because they're not good. No... they win. They are not good. That is why they win. 80,000 Euros. Good. I call the 80,000 Euros. Three 8s. I'm sorry. Two 8s. Yes. Three 8. I think there is a problem. There are two 8s. You must forgive me. I think I am a victim... of a strange ailment. I need a break. - Break accepted? - Absolutely, for me. What can I say? The pot is yours. Giulio, my friend. What is wrong with you? Answer. Hello? Eugenio, how is Granddad? What do you mean? Are you kidding? Eugenio... Hello, Eugenio? - He hung up. - So how is your granddad? He's fine. But he wants me to play. Meaning? - He wants me to end the game. - It's extraordinary. No, it's not extraordinary. - If he thinks you can play... - Yes, but this is not a game. Of course it is, with a great stake, but it is a game. Eli, this game must change our life. If I lose that money, we are ruined. Understand? He is afraid of losing and is dumping the responsibility on me. No, come on, stop it. It can't be. He's shitting in his pants, I tell you. But since he feels better now, he goes to play. I would've wanted to come in and kick you in the rear end. Because you can hear from outside. Go talk to him. He is waiting for you. And if you don't feel like playing, don't. Right, I won't play. What's the problem? Excuse me. Now get your ass up and go play. Is that clear? Marco, Marco, Marco. I really feel awful. Stop it. It's all false. You want me to play. - Why not? - Are you crazy? Can you see me at the table with those guys? Granddad, I'm a kid. I'll disappoint you and myself, too. How the shit can I play with them. Will you explain that? You are not reasoning. You've an extra weapon that nobody has.... Your freshness. Did you see them? They take themselves too seriously. They are players. Don't joke. Marco, I'm not joking. Sit down and play. - Granddad. - Yes. We didn't come here to play. We came here to solve the family problems. Now get your ass up and go play. Is that clear? We have already solved our problems. - What do you mean? - Even if we lose, we won. You mean, you are paid even if you lose? Well, that isn't true. I don't believe it. Why should I lie to you? Swear it to me. I swear. Are you happy? You see, I am confused, stunned. The scenario is changing. And the critics must adjust. And that is lovely. You must see what that man is doing, to avoid your understanding that you are in trouble. During these days, I saw... What can I say? Something incredible, which should be filmed. In the morning, he performs. What do you mean? He has the recorded voices of the cook who greets, the door opens, it closes... It's incredible! He was able to set up such a... So... there is nobody helping him? No. He does cleaning and cooking. Do you realize that? What a shit. I feel like crying out to him, "Why didn't you put that in my blood?" Not everybody can reach those summits. Each of us has his... mountain. I ran away from this house, considering it dangerous. I couldn't comprehend your union, or your thoughtlessness. We lived in continuous euphoria. Beautiful. Euphoria is beautiful. It bothered me, Claudio. There was a time when it bothered me. I don't know what euphoria is. Euphoria is not for me. You described your father with love and euphoria, simultaneously. They say it is... contagious. Contagious? Especially for a kid who is a sponge like Marco. For who I wanted something else. I wanted other examples. Excuse me. Eugenio, how wonderful. What is it? A spaceship? I remember a humid place, and some black and white monitors. There was a clothes-rack there. What happened to it? Hello, sweet Elisabetta. What a pleasure to see you. Do you like it here? Very much. Thank you, Mr. Giulio. I know I've ended up in a cuckoo's nest, but... I adore lunatics. But someone I know, instead, is certainly not so well off. What do you say? He's fine. Believe me. He asked me to give you this. Thank you. I have a request before beginning. I ask for fifteen seconds to be able to observe you. Fifteen seconds? I'd say an unusual request. - What do you think? - Twenty is fine too. Alright? You want to know what kind of players we are? - So, we can play? - Time is up. Please. - Do you hear it too? - Yes. It is lovely. "Lovely"? I mean, would Pupi come here? You people do films and you sell them, right? Right. What does it cost you? If he were the director, they would be small masterpieces. A dream come true. Go. I open. - I'm not playing. - I'm playing. One card, please. Please. One. Chip. Not even a chip. 5,000. 20,000. Time. He opened. The opening should have been done with Kings or Aces. Why does he dance like that? Let him be, Eugenio. He's chatting. He got three cards. A couple, probably Aces. He can't have three of a kind. He discarded an Ace, and I got one back. Yes, he has 2 Aces left. He tried. And if he doesn't like to lose, I'll take him for a ride. 50,000. I call. A very proud couple of Kings with Queens. You won. Two Aces. I imagined you had three of a kind, believe me. Very brave. - Too much? - Look at his hands. They aren't shaking at all. He bet 50,000 Euros with almost nothing in his hand. It was a great point. If you imagined he had three of a kind, why did you push it? You see, it was a Queen of hearts. She told her King, "Sire, please, command a relaunch for me". So, you were obliged. I've seen many... but that boy stole something of his granddad's DNA. Luck has something to do with it too, huh? Yes, but there is more. In fact, even Giulio noticed. You think he's got what it takes to being a good card player? There is one hour left of playing. Let's hope he keeps out of risky situations. How much is he winning? I know one shouldn't ask. Oh... one more or less. - One million? I'm in. I'm in too. Me too. Plus 20,000. 20,000. Up to 100,000. I'm in. 300,000. No. I'm out. 500,000. No, I'm out. Time. He has three 10s! You transmitted the problem to him of seeing four? Let's leave him alone. He just had to put on the brakes a bit. Think positive, please! There are moments when it is no longer a card game. Cards and money no longer matter. There are only two heads left, challenging each other. Whatever the outcome, what matters is having believed in it. In those cases, will power makes the difference. Alright. Two cards, please. Another Queen is not enough. You mean a Full is not enough. Donna Maria got a card and has poker in her hand? - I wouldn't exclude it. - Eugenio, what is going on? Is it a mess? In the worst case, we each have poker. There can't be a royal flush. There are no more 10s. I discarded an Ace and a King. The Queen arrived, and brought the 10. So there can't be a poker of Aces, Poker of Kings and Poker of Queens. There can be of Jacks, and also of 9s, 8s and 7s. I am well off as far as the odds go. Check. Get that! Donna Maria is leaving me the responsibility. But I am for peace, right now. Chip. 500,000. What I've left. Everything. He's playing everything? Besides the winning, the pot too? It's a great challenge, and there are excellent possibilities. I call. There should be all of it. I came to your level before the cards. Sure. What is it, Marco? Did the Queen of Hearts intervene this time too? Yes... and she assured me that if Donna Maria doesn't have a poker of Jacks, the pot is ours. And Queens don't lie. Are you really sure that Queens never lie? They do so on rare occasions, but only for love. And this is not the case. My compliments. I thank you very much. You don't have to thank me. You must tell me when you'll return... great Giulio. I want you to keep it. They'll have to kill me to take it away. Who will save the roses now? Hey, love birds! Do I have your word that you won't gamble over 100 Euros? Will you call Mom? I can't. You bluffed. Bravo, bravo. Don't tell Mom. She wouldn't accept it. So what'll we do? I'll solve the matter, as always. Claudio, did you leave a little place for the cream-puffs? No, and forget it. I am full. Only four. Very small but excellent. I'll eat them later if I feel like it. Bravo... remember, though. I said... If I feel like it! - Remember, though. - I'll remember if I feel like it. My compliments. You are still good. Right? The bank debt has been paid back. There are over 600,000 Euros in the account! I won't use that money. A collection was done for me. That is the truth. Eugenio was the amplifier. You mean the people you beat, now helped you? So there was no game? Yes, there was, Valeria. Created specifically to have Marco win 1,800,000 Euros. Exactly what arrived. - Marco played poker? - He thinks he did. They were all actors, Valeria. And he lived a fantastic dream, convinced of having saved the family. And which of the three fables should I believe? Three? There is also the hypothesis that none of the two is true! Which of the three should I believe? The one you prefer, Valeria. The one you prefer. I am your father, Valeria. I am your father. Beautiful place, beautiful structure. But in Alghero, 2,000 Euros a night. For what reason? We won't sell rooms, we'll sell sunsets at 2,000 Euros. The room is a gift. The year 2015 was below average, but the results are impressive. Out of 362... because we lost 3... 51 are completely gray, 86 are intense azure blue, and 225 with nuances that go from antique pink to purple red. Alberto will show it to you with an energy savings projector. Now I understand why, "Bring your bag". Here they are. Spring. Well? I appreciate the offer, but I turn it down. Me too. I'm sorry. I like the idea, and the courage, very much. If the data is concrete, I'm in. It doesn't convince me either. I'm sorry. I will cover for them, with the hope of a gift dinner. Not a dinner. I don't want to think it is bound to the quotas. I see it more as a verification. If I accepted, I would be questionable, right? And if there is no color, we won't make people pay? No. We have 225 chances out of 363, right? Right. You made your deal. We made the deal. No, thanks. I don't understand. I don't either. And the ring? I've nothing to do with it. Mom. I'll be there in fifteen minutes. Let's see who moves the arm's muscle more quickly. Me. Look... Claudio, look. I can still do it! Claudio. Come on, Claudio! You try it. Come on. Want to bet on who wins? Excuse me... Thank... you... A life, a life together, Claudio... My rose whispers strange words, this morning. Mixed, sung, like time. And I like to hear it, we like to hear it. It seems that it has also understood, like me, this morning. It's doing the most wonderful thing. My rose is walking by itself, this morning, it's reaching its vase by itself. And I like it, even full of spines, I like it. THREE MONTHS LATER Together we were the strength that is needed to live. Almost too much loving. Almost, Marco, because... it is never too much. Meanwhile, she managed to sell sunsets. You see? A sort of black and white sunset... but it works! In black and white, regarding yesterday's. Mom! Valeria? I'm going to lunch with Alberto. Marco, I saw Granddad going to the Carlos V. Know why he's there? No. I'm in front of it. I'll go inside and ask, and will let you know. Talk to you later. - Good morning. - Please. May I help you? A gentleman just walked in, Giulio Santelia. - The gentleman took a room. - A room? Yes. - May I talk to him? - Right away. Go to the veranda and I'll have him join you when he can. - The veranda... thank you. - That way. Marco. I found him. Burraco tournament. Among friends. I don't know who they are. Yes. See you after lunch. Alright. It can't be. He must have misplaced the phone. - May I go to him? - Actually, I can't... He's my father. Dad! - Valeria, why? - What is it? Are you alright? Dad... what do you want to do? What is going on? Let's do something now. We'll put away that stuff and leave. Lunch is ready. I made ragù sauce with loving care, as you say! We're leaving, huh? - Don't ask me that. - Of course I'm asking you, Dad! You must forget this! - Valeria, don't ask me that. - Don't ask me? - No. - I am not ready! The two of you can't do this to me! Every day I spend here is one day less that I spend with him. I want to join him, Valeria. And if you make me live... you'll kill me. Please don't say that. Let's take our time. I don't need time. It used to fly, and was never enough. But now, I have no use for it. - I don't need it, I don't want it. - Stop it! I still have so many things to say to you, Dad. Then do something, Valeria. Choose the most important. I read all your letters, Dad. They are so beautiful. They tortured my heart, but... I hoped till the end to read, "Valeria, come back home". Why didn't you ever ask me that? A daughter expects it. Does that mean you are fine like this? What is the reason, Dad? What sense is there in knowing the reason? It was a wrong reason, Valeria. It was a wrong reason. Go back home. I'm already back home, Dad. I'm already back home, Dad. Go back home.
