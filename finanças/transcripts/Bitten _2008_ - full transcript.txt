Unless you're talking about those tweakers working, you know, down in your neighbourhood. Jesus, I wouldn't pay 50 cents and a day-old sandwich for one of those. I was being facetious. Yeah, well, I wasn't. You ever see those girlsin the daylight? Huh? [shudders]: Ooh. Hey! Hey, and stop blaming the job, huh? But the job is the problem. I work nights. I have no time for a personal life, let alone a fucking relationship. Hey, jack. Relationships are work, jacko. You know? You've got to do whatever it takes to give them the attention that they think they need. Yeah, well, why the fuck do they need all the attention? You know what I need? I need someone to take care of me for once, pay me a little bit of attention. I wake up every fucking dayand take care of everyone else. When's it my fucking turn? It will be your turn when you're old and grey and pissing in your diapers. That's when it'll be your turn. Hey... go home. I'll finish this up. Huh? No, I'll do it. It's... No. Head out. Go.

Yeah, I mean, I have seen girls that I've beenattracted to and stuff, but none of them made mefeel the way you do. Jack... that's the sweetest thing anyone's ever said to me. What can I say? I'm a sweet guy. Yeah, you are... and conceited, too. Blocked! Blocked! Blocked! Blocked! [laughing] Yeah. You know. I'm going to get you. Yeah, you are. This ismy favorite part. [tv plays] Wow. What's the occasion? Let's go out. Out where? Anywhere. I don't care. I'm sick of being cooped up in here. Take me somewhere. Nah. No way. We can't go anywhere. It's too risky. Come on.

As long as you're there, Yeah, jack, come. You wouldn't want to keep a couple of ladies waiting, would you? Are you fucking crazy? Go on in. We'll be a minute. You pick up some girl and bring her to my fucking house? What the fuck are you thinking? Shh! She's for us. Don't tell me to fucking "shh." What, are you going to fucking eat her? Jack, I want you, but I don't want to hurt you if I lose control. That's what she's for. Wait, so you're going to bite her instead of me, like some fucking chew toy? I don't know any other way. No, okay? Junkies, dealers... that's one thing. But just some girl? You're going to fucking kill her! Not if you stop me in time. Not if I stop you in time? Come. What are you fucking doing, jack?

She was an innocent girl! She wasn't like the others. No. The others were men. You know what the fuck I mean! What the fuck? Look at me! I'm fucking covered in fucking blood! I've been sleeping in her fucking death! I'm sorry! I couldn't help myself. "I'm sorry." you're sorry? You're fucking sorry? Fuck! I'm going to put a fucking end to this shit right now! How?

That's none of your business, okay? She's in my building, she's my business. [gasps] Aye-ya! What's that messon the floor? It's nothing. I'm cleaning it up right now. Just some accident. Is that blood? It's not what it looks like, honest. [shuddering] I'm going tocall the police. [gasps] [screaming]get off her! Get the fuck away from me! [groans] [danika munching and slurping] [♪♪♪] [humming to self] Well, look who decidedto show up today. I'm not in the mood tonight, man. Not in the mood? I've been coveringyour ass for three days. Yeah, sorry about that. Sorry? Is there somethingyou want to tell me? Like, where the fuck you've been? I don't want to talk about it. You looklike ass, jack. Not yourself. I'm fine, all right? I just haven't got much sleep. Yeah. That's what you've been saying. [slams door] What the fuck's your problem? Small discrepancy in the inventory this week. A bag of blood went missing. Now, dayshift said it's our fuck-up, but that's bullshit. It disappeared on their shift. So it's their problem. That's what I said. But bill said you came in the other day with some bullshit story about forgetting your wallet in the fridge. What the fuckwould I want with a bag of blood? That's what I'd like to know. You look like shit, jack. You don't show up for work, and you've been squirrelly ever since you met this bitch. Now, look, jack, if there's something you want to tell me, I'll understand. I've been there. Huh? But you got to be straight with me. [dispatch]: Red 17, we have a report of an unconscious male bleeding out at east end convenience, third and avenue "c". Copy? Fuck, that's near my house! Copy that, dispatch! We're on our way. Fuck! He's not responding. Damn bullet must havepassed right through him... Probably nickedan artery. Gel it. Come on, buddy. Stay with us. You know this guy? Yeah, he kicked me out of the store last week for getting blood on the floor. Oh, a real sweetheart. Charged. Clear! Not so worried about the blood now, are you? Still no heartbeat. Give me a half epi. Come on, come on, come on. My type ain't going to let you die tonight. What the fuckare you talking about? Nothing. We got a heartbeat! Let's get him in the van. Nice save, rog! See you tomorrow. Hold up, kid. [mouths word] The rig needs servicing. I need you to run it over to the depot and bring back a replacement. It's all the wayacross fucking town, man. I have to get home. The missus is going to have to wait, jacko. And we aren't done our little conversation. [knock at door] Jack's not here. I know. He's running an errand. Maybe you should comeback when jack's here. Nah, I'm good. You know how long I've known jack? Two years. I trained him. He told me. He thinksreally highly of you. Yeah, he's a good kid. Just a little stupid when it comes to women. So whatare you saying? You think I'm notgood enough for him? Hard to say. I don't know you. But, then again, neither does jack, does he? What are you doing? What's your story, huh? Where did you come from? [slams down lid] And, more importantly, what are you hiding from? I'm not hidingfrom anything. Really? You're camped out here in my buddy's place. You got nowhere to go, no i.d., no family. Oh, ho, ho, you're hiding somethin', sweetcakes. I think you shouldleave now. I'll tell jack you stopped by. [pounds stovetop] Cut the crap, bitch! Girls like you don't just shack up with guys like jack. Fuck! Girls like you don't even exist outside of jerk-off magazines. No, you're hidin' from somethin', and whatever lies you've got coming down, I'm betting they're coming down hard on jack, too. I'm not mixed upin anything, and I'm not a liar. No, you're just a junkie. You got jack usin', too? I'm not an addict. And what the hell are you looking for? This! What have you got him into, huh? And what the fuck are you doing with a bag of blood? Christ... is that how you kicked the junk? Huh? He gave you a fuckin' blood transfusion? You need to go now. No, I don't think so. I think we'll just sit tight and wait for old jackie boy to get home. You wouldn'twant to cause any troublefor jack, would you? He thinksthe world of you. Let's just forgetyou ever came by. Okay? [door opens] Hey, jack. What the fuck are you doing here? Me and danika are just havinga little heart-to-heart. About you, of course. You send me on a fucking errand so you can come hereand talk to her behind my back? You got problems, kid. Big problems. [flies buzzing] Uh, listen, rog, I ain't got time for this shit right now. Yeah, I bet you don't. What are you going to lie to meabout next? Huh, jack? You wouldn't believe me if I told you. Try me. Jack... listen, rog, you got to go, man. Why don't you just go home? I got shitto deal with, man. [scoffs bitterly] You're doing itagain, jack. Doing what? Throwing it all away on a piece of ass. Remember your last two relationships? You ditched your friends, you ditched your family. Who's left, huh? You going to ditch me, jack? No. No, I'm not going to ditch you. You're not listening to me. I just need you to go home. Get the fuck out of here, rog! Get out of my way, you junkie bitch. Not so fast, roger! Let him go, danika! Go home. Come on, rog. [quietly]: What the hellwas that all about? She's all fucked up. Go home, get drunk. Read a magazine or something. [bang] [snaps]: What? I just got to use your crapper. I... Asshole! What the fuck? That's my best friend! You know what? That's my only fucking friend, and you're sitting here, ready to fucking pounce on him? He suspects something. He could ruin all of this. He ain't going to ruin shit. If you ever fucking look at him like that again, I'll fucking... You'll what? I'll put an end to whatever the hell "us" is. Let's go out. Have you listened to anything I said? I need more. Let's go find me something. How the fuck could you need more? It's never enough. [sighing]: Come with me. Jack, I want to get the hell out of here! Just come! We'll... we'll go out. Clean yourself up. Jack? Jack! Jack! Please let me out! What are you doing? Let me out! No. Jack, please! Please let me out. You're just going to have to go hungry. I'm sorry! Jack! Jack, don't do this to me! I'll be back as soon as I can. I have to just think some things out. [raging]: Jack! Jack! Let me out of here, you bastard! Shit. [♪♪♪] Must be nice. [roger]: Yeah, one fuckin' second! I'm onthe goddamn can! [toilet flushing] Well, look who's come to apologize. And you do owe me one, by the way. I almost shit myselfon the way back from your place. I was turtling the whole way. We need to talk. Can I come in? Come on. Thanks. Whew. Sorry 'bout the smell. The fan's busted. Why don't we talk outside? So, what the fuckwas that about, back at your place? It's complicated, rog. I mean, I just want you to know, anything I said I didn't mean, all right? I just wanted to get you out of there before anything bad happened. Something bad? What the hell's this broadgot you tied up in? All I know is, I need her out of my fucking life faster than she came in. Shit. Now, that's the firstpiece of sense I've heard you talkin weeks. So, did you kick herout of your place? I'm scared to. Why? What is she? Some kind of... psycho, or a ninjaor something? Huh? Tell her to getthe fuck out! "Hit the road!" Christ, if you don't... she's going to be suckingthe life out of you forever. Forever's a long time. Fucking a. What the fuck do I say to her? I don't know. Tell hersome woman shit. You know, like, what did what's-her-namesay to you when she broke upwith you? Sherry? Yeah. She said it was too soon after her last relationship, and, you know, in their language, it meant, "I'm getting my hot-pocket stuffed by my yoga instructor." Well, there you go. There you go. Tell herthe same thing, which, in our language, means, "get the fuck out." She met sherry. She'll never believe that. Well, then you got tobe more blunt. Break her heart now, before it's too late. Huh? You want to know the quickest wayto a woman's heart, in my opinion? Yeah. Yeah? Right through her fuckin' chest! [cackling] You want a beer? Huh? Yeah? Come on. That's it, rog! Yeah? What's it? I'll explain later! I'll call you. [roger laughing] [stops laughing] What the hell did I say? [starts laughing] "Right through her fuckin' chest!" Ah... [darkly]: Oh, fuck! [weak and raspy]: Hello? Jack, is that you? Yeah, it's me. Jack? Jack? Please let me out of here. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, too. I'll let you out, I promise, but I need to talk to you. Can you do that for me? I don't seem to havemuch choice now, do I? I can't do this anymore. It's killing me inside. All right? I'm dying. I totally lost myself in this relationship, and I just need to get me back. Are you breaking up with me? It's not you, it's me. I just can't be in this situation. What situation, jack? Things are amazing between us. I just need to eat. [danika sniffling] You wouldn't want me to go hungry, would you? To starve? All right, if "eating" meant bringing you to the nicest restaurants in town, then I would spendevery last penny on you, danika. But that's not the case. I can't help it, jack. I didn't ask for any of this. [danika weeping] But you... you gave me hope in a situation that I thought was hopeless. You can't just forget everythingwe had together. I'd never forget you, danika. Okay? But I just can't be with you. I can't be in a commitment. It's just... it's just too soon. Don't quit on me, jack. Jack, please. I'll do anything. Anything, I swear! Just please don't leave me. I need you. I can't be a part of it. When I saw that crazed look in your eye today, I just knew we were over. I can't believe you're doing this to me. How could you do this to me? I need you, jack. [sobbing] We were meant to be together I can't go on without you, jack. [sniffling] I know, dani. I know. [jack gasps and grunts] So, what? You're going to try and kill me now? You don't have it in you, jack. Nobody locks baby in the bathroom! [choking] [jack groaning] You were wrong, jack. It's not you. It's me! [screaming] [crash] Oh, shit. What the fuck are you doing, jack? She's a fuckingvampire, rog! She fuckingkilled sherry and killed a bunchof other people. She needs to befucking stopped! [chuckles sadly]: Oh, jack. You're worse off than I thought. A vampire? What the fuck are you on, kid? Dude, I'm fuckingserious! She eats people, man. She's fuckingstrung out! Why do you thinki stole the blood? Why do you thinki got you out of here? She was going tofucking eat you. Oh, yeah, yeah. She's going to eat me. Yeah! Hey! Just put the weapon down, okay? All right? Just put it down. Is she okay in there? Huh? You didn't hurt her, did you? Don't go in there, rog. She'll fucking eat you! You've fucking lost it, kid. [door opens and danika roars] [crashing] Oh! The bitch has fucking fangs! I fucking tried totell you that shit, but you wouldn'tlisten to me. No, no, no, jack. You're not hearing me. That fuckin' bitch has fangs, and she's angrier than my first fuckin' wife! We've got tofucking kill her. I'll hold her down, and you stab herthrough the fucking heart. But don't miss. If you miss, we're both fucking dead. You better be able to restrain her, you know? Because the last time we were in this fucking situation, you tried to talk the asshole down. That was a fuckingcockroach in the ear. Fucking this time... this is the cockroach. Okay. You ready? You ready? Count of three. You ruinedeverything, jack. We could have been together forever! Oh! Oh, it's my fault? You're the onewho eats people, and I'm the asshole? Oh, spare me the bullshit, jack. You ready? One, two... a, nute! On three, or after three? What? You two are pathetic. On the count of fuckin' three, jack. One, two... I said on fucking three, you idiot! [roaring] [jack shouting rapid-fire kung-fu commands] [crashing] You make this too easy, jack. [screaming] God damnson of a bitch! [roaring] [stake plunging through flesh] [heartbeat pounding] [roger]: Is she dead, jack? Did I kill her? Rog, how many times did you hit her? Once. She ain't dead yet. [flesh ripping] [panting]: Is she dead now, jack? Just one more time, for me. It's okay, jacko. We're going to get you some help. Rog, I don't know howit's going to turn out, but you can't let mebecome like her. I won't, jack. I won't. I'm serious, man. I don't want to be a monster. I don't want to eat people.
