Raymond! Illustrious Oedipus Paeon Creon, Jocasta All that lovely bunch At their crayon handrail, joke-casting Quite awfully, seen up close Cry out to the East and to the West From their platform of peony plaster Over which spreads the big toe Of the Oedipal appendage... Youth has other tasks besides dying. But heroes always die young. My friends... Pretend to weep. For I am pretending... to die. I surrendered to detoxification treatment. I was admitting defeat, giving myself up. Baths, it seems, can be annoying. They drove me mad. I said to Dr K... I know doctors. You like me well enough, but you like medicine more. He said he had, at last, an articulate patient, that he learnt more from me, as I described my symptoms, than at the hospital, where the question, "Where does it hurt?" Invariably received the reply: "I dunno, Doctor". Detoxifying the addict is like saying to Tristan, "Kill Iseult. "You'll feel better afterwards." Of course, opium is unique, its euphoria greater than that of health. To it I owe all my perfect hours. I remember it was in April '22, in Villefranche. I was rediscovering the sun, as it shone on the sea. The dazzling light, the fixed star, the small port and the sailors. The beach and its exquisite torpor. Then, suddenly, he was there. Him. The angel Heurtebise. Radiant with youth and the insolence of beauty. Already aware of those provocative poses and lethal gestures. This animal out of Rimbaud, proud, merry, ferocious and already tragic. Love cannot resist seasickness. One must fall back on ancient methods. In the Middle Ages they exhausted the patient, drained him, purged his bile... returning to the legends which drove out demons. Monsieur, there's a child asking for you. A child with a stick. Show him up. Come in. Cyprien announced a "child", but you are a young man. Thank you for seeing me. I admire you above all else. That goes without saying. I am not a young man with a future. I am retired. How amusing. I've written a book. I have the manuscript here. I shall not write another. I would like your opinion. Nothing could be more important to me. Your opinion, that is all. Very well. What is your name? Raymond Radiguet. We've already met, you know. - I don't remember. - You've forgotten. Well... I shall read your work, I promise. We'll see you out. Cyprien! See Mr. Radiguet out. Goodbye. Events don't happen to us. We encounter them by the side of the road. It is quite probable that nothing ends nor begins. Every morning I tremble, I die and I begin again. I seem to have a gift for suffering, preferring to love than be loved, I have been told. Opium is the femme fatale, pagodas, lanterns... Since science cannot separate its curative and destructive effects, I must yield. There remains an antidote, a pleasure, an extreme siesta... O heavenly kindness of opium! Tell me where the load hurts I shall nurse The wound Its cold lips Wide open Crying its cry I shall hear the marrow flute So light Which the skeleton Holds only by a thread Because of the bag of blood The bag of saliva, the bag of bile Bags badly fixed To a wasp waist Cut in two! Look up! Look how I stand out against the sky like an angel. An angel is talking to you. That deserves a raising of your head! Raymond, I always knew that you'd been lent to me, that I'd soon have to give you back. The pupil Radiguet soon became my master. This seer of the real, this diver, this cutter of crystal, was a master of the art of seduction. He'd lure you, without warning, onto dangerously fast trains. Monsieur. I haven't yet paid my respects. Raymond Radiguet. Good evening. Good evening. I only invited you because Jean asked me to. Are you pleased with yourself? I don't like you. At all. You're killing Jean. But if you do kill him, I'll kill you too. I assure you I'm not joking. A mystery is in the air... Let us pretend we are responsible for it. No, it's not Raymond. Nor is it the concierge. Wait, I'll tell him. Raymond, a lady for you. She says her name's Emilie, but I know the viscountess. Do you want to talk to her? Yes, I'm sorry, but apparently... He's refusing to speak to you. Well, what do you want me to do? I can't do anything. How charming you are! Goodbye, Madame. Bitch! "That was nice, thank you." Are you asleep? Radiguet was a substance impossible to analyse. Alive, capricious, capable of suddenly turning on you, like opium. It's rare for a smoker to quit opium. Opium quits him after ruining everything. OUTOF LUCK Radiguet delighted in the prestige bestowed on him by his frivolity. But his attraction to the mirror's dark side drew him inexorably to the cursed, the unloved and the unlucky. You remind me of an old friend. He was as pretty as you. So pretty I was embarrassed. Soused in alcohol, he fought only those battles he was sure to lose. One day he just left. It was fate. Meant to be. Out of luck Don't fight it. What's the point of my nursing you? If you stopped scratching you'd be unable to write. I didn't turn my jacket inside-out, but my skin. That's much harder. The Mariés de la Tour Eiffel scandal was dirty linen washed in the family. I'd wanted to cover my tracks. Trompe-I'ceil theatre, children's games, human phonographs, laughter on every floor... Heavens! A telegram. Here's the manager of the Eiffel Tower. Monsieur, do you think you're out hunting? I was pursuing an ostrich. End of dialogue. Quiet! But the precursor spirit didn't please the dogmatists, of whom there were many. André Breton spat out his hatred. It's a farce! A farce! Bravo! Maurice Sachs defended me, but he could just as well have done the opposite. André, really! It's an outrage! Be quiet! Curtain, curtain! Curtain! Jean? Get up. Come on. Everyone wants to congratulate you. There he is. Bravo, Jean! Such modernity! You put them all in the shade. You're a genius of nonsense. It was wonderful. The people of Paris are behind you. It's extraordinary. So daring, so daring... He's being Dadaist. Theatre isn't his domain. He dabbles in everything. Bravo! Man Ray wants a photo. When you're ready... They didn't understand tonight, but you're a genius, Jean. You will overcome. God, it's so ugly. That's the supreme power! To be disliked... How fabulous to be so disliked. Few can achieve that. Just a minute... I know you're exhausted, Jean. I'm sorry. Tristan... I'm nearly ready. It was an era of overturning all values, ready to start again. It was the Dada movement. Tzara came up with the word. Keep still... That's good. Perfect. Man Ray, that genius of form, that anchor of light, immortalised us. Just between us, it was clownish and grim. No, it was a success. Jean must be pleased. He got his scandal! He's no poet. Nor even a novelist. No, he's a custard pie. Don't forget the pie dish. That's very important. What's the pie dish? Also known as a Radiguet! The turd, and the turd dish! Stop it. Jean is a huge talent. An artist, a great writer, a poet... - This mockery is just a fashion. - Fashion or not... Yes, it's racy and new, but he bones the quail before serving it. So much honey on his paws we can't see the claws. All those innuendos... So tiresome! And repeating all the time: "Heaven is for everyone!" That's nice enough. He's my toreador, adorned and adored. How pretty! He deserves some credit. He got Picasso to work on the sets and the masks. They were fine. Chanel's sets weren't unpleasant. Personally, I like Honneger. It's unfair of the smart set to attack him. He's a great poet. The so-called "blood-soaked poet"! It's his human sensibility you are making fun of. And he knows it. It's unjust. He's living off the corpses of Valéry and Marinetti. Do you want my opinion? Monsieur Cocteau is an anti-creativity vaccine. Frivolity before everything! That's how you get in the dictionary. One cocktail, several Cocteau! Another Radiguet. I prefer the original, I hate imitations. You're late. We're starving! - Yes, Madame. - "Madame"? - Company! - These communists scare you? André Breton demanded obedience from his entourage. My independent character incited his hatred. Good evening. Yet I hate only hatred. I have always had esteem for those I have judged to be worthy foes. Raymond's name began to circulate through Paris. Fighting a new battle, he had a passion for life, a desire to please... With his innocent looks and diabolical smile, they all succumbed. Coco Chanel, Tristan Tzara, Man Ray. His articles will appear in Les Nouvelles Littéraires. Bérard said Jean had a new "master". The first since Satie. One is 60, the other 19. Of the same generation? His talent would soon rub shoulders with glory. Sorry, but I'm very late. MR RADIGUETSIGNS WITH PUBLISHER GRASSET MR RADIGUETON THE OCCASION OF THE PUBLICATION OF HIS BOOK How old are you? Nineteen. Explain the success of The Devil in the Flesh. I must have some talent. Is it genius? I am, at best, a taxidermist or tightrope walker. Jean Cocteau has called you "a machine that cuts crystal". He's generous. Writing is more necessary to me than bread and water. Maurice Sachs had endless charm. I could not say where or how I met him. He haunted the clinics in which my health kept me for long periods. Le Boeuf sur le Toit was the hub of audacity and revolution, a rendezvous for the avant-garde, encounters and metamorphoses. I spent much of my time there. Talent leads to a fall. If one does not see them in time, one slides down every slope. He's dead drunk half the time. Violently vain as a peacock. I bumped into him. He wants to seduce. Nothing more. A marvellous owl. Unmoving and blind on his perch. And Jean, his protector, is an insect with metal wings. We watch him squander his wit, fearing he is an unrecognised genius. The smart set attribute every kind of marvel to him. "Unrecognised"? He peddles poison to the young. He's a harmful, morbid charmer. - Look who it is! - Diaghilev. Diaghilev's moist eye had the curve of a Portuguese oyster. He and Nijinsky toured the world with their dance troupe, like a gaudy funfair. Drink bird milk, wash chocolate, eat veal! He's coming apart. You should sign him, poet that you are. An amusing game. It isn't a game. When he was 16, his mother realised he was short-sighted, had glasses made, and it was then that Raymond saw how ugly the world is. Here, you'll look serious at last. Accept, purely to please me. On a sea in the air Houses and the void Don't forget the ball A boat made of wire Sailors entwined Whom the waltz has destroyed Offering to all takers Many profiles to admire The piano of love The sailors mechanic The girls scorning The oarsmen's bare arms At times on the dance floor A young epileptic Fought the angel Midst clamour and charms They were but houses Which were shipwrecked midstream And balconies everywhere Dark with lovers' shades Rather than escaping Far from their colonnades Allowed themselves To be swallowed by the dream... Beauty is a trick of nature to draw creatures together and ensure their support. It works in a disorderly way, its mechanism gropes its way along, but it gets there at all costs. Picasso said that opium has the least stupid smell in the world. But if it's not in a metal box, the black serpent will soon have slipped away. It will creep along the walls and in no time wrap around the local constable. More, more... I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Apologise to her for me. I'm not hungry. Come in. Mr. Cocteau. There's a Maurice Sachs for you. Show him in. It's a very good clinic. Dr Blanche has treated De Maupassant, Nerval, Baudelaire... You could go for a few days. I spent 3 nights there. Yes, I know it. I know it. In the meantime, I have brought you... this. It's astounding. Thank you. "Art is dead. Let us kill it." That's beautiful. Really beautiful. I've corrected a few punctuation mistakes. I hope you like it. Thank you. Thank you, Master. May I read it? Be my guest. It's not my work. It's your handwriting. Count d'Orgel's Ball... Nice. It's the outline of a novel. There's more to write. But I won't write it. Raymond will. And it will be a masterpiece. You know, Master... I understand why so many have sacrificed their youth for you. You cause them to be born. As simple as that. I simply want to say that... I am one of them. Do with me what you will. I have Cocteau in my hand! I'm his typist! His typist! I cannot bemoan being fooled. If he stole from me, it was to buy me gifts. He gave more than he took, and took in order to give. In love, he said, there is one who gives life and one who kills. The infernal machine was powered by calculations unknown to the stagehands, from ladders in the wings forbidden to the sweeps, on pain of death. The infernal machine... The infernal machine, with sickening precision, also kept the candelabra of stars in motion... Good evening. - For Monsieur Cocteau. - Very well, Viscountess. Tell him they're Chinese curios. Very well, Viscountess. It's a lot more than last time. Mr. Raymond has the adjoining room. Mr. Jean said you agreed, otherwise I should never have taken the liberty. He receives a good number of young people. Well, well. Talk of the devil! Jean is in an awful state. There's nothing I can do. There's a lot you could do. You're well suited to cruelty. You're writing a book at no great cost to you. Le Bal du Comte d'Orgel. The aristocracy is more susceptible to your interest than intellectuals and artists. You need the former. That is true. With the aristocracy, one soon touches bottom. But you enjoy that, touching bottom. Keep the change. I like Brancusi's portrait of you. Astonishing. See you Tuesday. You may check. I trust you, my good fellow. Now I feel like a Manhattan. You wouldn't have any gin, would you? We can ask for some to be sent up. No, don't bother. Picabia told me, "Painting is for dentists. "2 and 2 make 22. "Dada, the cabaret of nothingness." How funny. I won't write this novel. I'm not your creature. - Where are you going? - Out! To drink an Alaska, then sleep at the studio. You're penniless. But Juan is in Spain. I have the keys. See you Tuesday at your friend the Viscountess's ball. You know, I hate those rebellious toffs you hang around with. Who has been more loved than me? No one... Who has been more hated than me? No one... And you... What do you think of me? I know what a Greek knows As the eldest I arose I have the Greek nose, that Aeneas knows I am mural art Art immured The armour I am vigour inherited I am rigour and verity I am severity I am the callous and cruel My lies are verity Severity where it lies I am the myth, the taken The mistaken, the taken Miss Lance the brow, balance now I am the marrow... And me? What do you think of me? Your cries Even under torture Are cries written helping pride The sea changes into scripture Once one dips one's nib In its inky depths... I'd like to sleep at your place tonight. I have my novel! I've set my easel before The Princess of Cleves, and it works! A Madame de La Fayette key, a Dangerous Liaisons bass and Benjamin Constant strings. It'll take some doing. It's simple. One character watches himself live, love and exult, before being betrayed, with the calm of someone shaving. The other suffers constant cases of amorous mistaken identity. It's a geometric principle! What time is it? 10 o'clock, Mademoiselle. Then I must go. What a coincidence! See you Tuesday. I love you. I love you. If we could measure the distance between us and those we think closest to us, it would frighten us. Childhood knows what it wants: To leave childhood behind. Then uneasiness begins, for youth knows what it doesn't want before knowing what it wants. But what it doesn't want is what we want. Sunday morning, on a gambling spree Cyclists dressed in their initials Cyclists, kings, idlers from Les Halles Your river of love adorns all Paree The market gardeners sleep on the roses The racers shoot over the horizon From earth and heaven, illustrious virtuosos Fade away like the sound of the diapason... Bravo! What's your name? Here, you'll make better use of it. Wait! What's your name? I'll tell you after. After what? Wait... Nice and hot! Thank you. At least tell me your name. We've met before. The Marchioness de Casati. I know her by heart. I've photographed her. I gave her four pairs of eyes. She said, "You've saved my soul". There's the rat. What is his game? Hide-and-seek, like everyone else. Through your legs, the landscape gardeners! Mademoiselle. Which is Mr. Cocteau's room? Mr. Cocteau wants no visitors today. But I have an appointment. He's not receiving visitors today. He's expecting me. - No visitors today. - I've been here 4 hours! Look. They are his own instructions. Please. Let him rest. - Tomorrow, then. - No. He's going south to take the waters. Just let me see him for 5 minutes. Monsieur, please don't insist. Thank you. I do not like to sleep When your face inhabits The night against my neck For I think of Death Which comes too soon To make us sleep so much I shall die, you will live And that keeps me awake Is there another fear? One day I'll no longer hear, next to my ear Your breathing and your heart How sweet it would be for me To disturb your dream To inhabit it for a while So I will tremble As the sun rises And opens both shutters for you Hurry we must, let us waste no time We shall take no rest nor endure hunger A few days from now you will still be younger Whereas I shall not, I am thirty years old Alas! Am I now going To complain in these lines About seeing, next to Charon Death's indifference To these circumstances Which will decide it? It lives, it waits It is not its role to choose our port For it, this detail Is a shrug of the shoulder Given it by Fate There is no point in praying to that old statue In knowing its plans For it is not Death itself which kills It has its assassins... Opium cushions us, carries us to the river of the dead, disembodies us so we become a light meadow. The night of the body teems with stars. But our happiness is a happiness in a mirror. I hate funerals. Angel Heurtebise My guardian angel I guard you, I hurt you I break you, I change your guard On guard, summer! I challenge you If you are a man Confess, my angel of white lead Angel Heurtebise, in watery robe Beloved angel, his grace did me harm He tortures me In me the demon is a turtle Once melodious, arrive, depart from agate Hard smoke, the speed that kills Beneath your diamond blades Reigns the mirror of maladies The walls, the walls have ears And the mirrors, lovers' eyes... Hello, stranger! It's lovely to see you. To the hotel... bienvenue. How are you, my beauty? Tell me where the load hurts I shall nurse you With cotton and gauze And the pink cross Stuck on top Tell me where the load hurts... Jean. You've never told me. Radiguet... How did he die? How can one die at 20 years old? Raymond died in the stupidest way possible. He died after eating oysters. The truth is... oysters are more dangerous than opium. Fix me a pipe. Yes. No. It amazes me that so many people fear death, for it is always in us. They should be resigned to it. We would not be so terrified of someone we live with. Far better to embrace it, becoming inured to its character, however deceitful. For it can be forgotten. We all accommodate death, reassuring ourselves with the lie that it's an allegorical figure appearing in the last act. It is our joie de vivre. Our youth. You all lie. Our growth. I don't lie to myself. Our loves. I love truth. But truth doesn't love you. Truth loves no one. But I have no love for lies. I swear. Lying can create dreadful problems. We trip over our lies, stumble and fall, unable to get back up. Everyone lies. That says it all. Don't you agree? I am much simpler than that. I am a lie who always tells the truth. Now, ladies and gentlemen, the strongest man in the world! Hear the story of the world's strongest man. He's crossed borders, conquered the greatest capitals, cleaved through oceans... Here he is, tonight, to tell you the most secret story of all. The most terrible! The most improbable and horrible. Quake, young people. Quake! For you tonight, ladies and gentlemen, the strongest man in the world! Almost naked Escaped from a trap of mud and nettles The Gypsy girl For the circus accounts robs the son of a count While the mother Crazily calls To the child on top of the ladder At the circus learning to fly Keep moving I'll teach you how not to fall! One can fly at any age The circus is a kite On its canvases and its ropes Pilferers of children fly Fly, pilferers! The night behind the embankment Where maternal cries can no longer be heard... Come back, my dear! Pity my pain! But the child remains deaf And eats supper with the thieves! Now, ladies and gentlemen, the strongest man in the world, and his doll, who leaps from one world to the next! You'll see that when Raymond has finished sucking his little lollipop, he'll plunge it into my heart. Admire the strength! The strongest man in the world! Graziella? - Are you there, darling? - Go away! Let me in. Be nice, my princess. I've made some onion soup. Let me in. Let me in! You're annoying me! We live in an enigma. We mustn't think we know any more than those watching us. We live, and do not see ourselves living. Angel Heurtebise, Rue d'Anjou Plays on the roof At hopscotch, hopping and fluttering Like a magpie or blackbird, cheeks afire Watch out, Heurtebise, my beautiful cripple We are being spied on Hide your pearls They must not kill you For by killing you each month It's me they kill, not you The death of the angel Heurtebise Was the death of the angel, the death Heurtebise was a death of an angel A death of an angel, Heurtebise A mystery of change An ace missing from the game A crime which the vine entwines A moonlit stock A song of a dining swan... If there was a fire at my house, it's the fire that I'd save. All finished off, antiquity Flat and rolled out, eternity Flat, finished, with fluted cavity I imagine antiquity Nose up, feet all pretty Folds from the head to the extremity Flat and rolled out, eternity Flat and finished, antiquity Flat, finished, with fluted cavity With ringed and fluted cavity With winged and moulded canopy The wet rose, scalloped and pretty Buttoned and deshabillé The sea of sculpted vitality The column with hair all curly Finished off, antiquity Youth of eternity... Mystery has its mysteries. The gods have their own gods. We have ours, they have theirs. It's called the infinite. Subtitles by Howard Bonsor Subtitling by L.V.T. - Paris
