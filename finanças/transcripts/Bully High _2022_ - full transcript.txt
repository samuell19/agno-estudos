Hi, this is Maryam Ali. Hi, this is... A-E-I-O-U. Nay, nay, nah, no, nu. Hi, this is Maryam Ali, reporting live from Pakistan. Hi, this is... Hi, this is Mary. Mary. Hi, this is Mary Ali. Hi, this is Mary Adams reporting live from Los Angeles, California, where we bring you the absolute best. Welcome to News Live at Five. Stay down, just butt down, down, up, nice. There's an arm right there, there's a big league arm. Nice. Here we go. Nice, there's a scoop. Good feet work. Oh, there's a hop. Come on now. Let's go, less crap. Get down, down, down, down, up, down, up. Let's go. You got it, Zack. Hi, guys, I'm Cameron. Everyone calls me Cam, and I'm an addict. Hi, Cam. I'm two years sober. It's been hard as hell. I struggle every day with the crash. The click in the brain, it goes haywire. We all know when the click hits. You wake up three days later in a California haze. Is that what the sun feels like? Where have you been, Cameron? There's no sunshine in jail. There's time and silence. You in your head. Words spinning around. You think you're going crazy, trying to battle something that you can control. I stand here strong and able to talk and share with you guys. I don't want you to be afraid of what's in here. Or out there. Nobody is above anybody in here. We're equals. Equally human with flaws. I've biked past here for years on my way to school, never thought of coming in, but I'm here now. I don't do drugs. And I don't drink. Much. I don't like the way it makes me feel. I mean, drink or no drink, I'm still the same weirdo. Butt down, there you go. You've gotta look the ball into your glove, all right? Let's go, you gotta concentrate. Mr. Walker, don't you think you're being a little hard on him? I can't afford to send him to college. Let's go. Come on, Zack, you got it. Atta boy! That's a good throw. You doing? Are you laughing? No, wasn't laughing. You can pick the balls up. Nicole, you need to focus, all right? If you're gonna get into a good college, you have got to straighten up. Oh, okay, Dad, I'll just straighten up. Go get cleaned up. Your mother's bringing a guest home. Guest? A foreign exchange student from Pakistan. She's coming to live with us. It's through the church. Look, it's just for your senior year, okay? She can stay in your room, you can take the guest room. Screw that. Hey! Nicole! Nicole will be happy to give up the room for you this year. Oh my God, I'm so sorry. Oh, Nicole! Get up and go clean your room. - No. - Now. Make her do it. What is wrong with you? So how was your flight? It was long, but it was fine. I'm happy to eat and sleep tonight, so thank you. You speak English very well. I do detect a slight British accent. I got an academic scholarship to an international school. My father couldn't afford to send me to private school. Oh, well, congratulations. Thank you. Congratulations on being poor. Nice of you to join us. I've only come because I'm hungry. Have a roll. So tomorrow is Sunday and every Sunday we go to church. We never miss. You know, I think you'll like being around this. It's nice. It's spiritual and they have wonderful music. Do they have music in Pakistan? Yes. Church is actually pretty boring, just a bunch of old guys telling women how to act, what to say, how to dress. So you get really sweaty in that thing? Nicole, I'm sure it has a name. It's called a hijab. It's actually light. Cool. Cool. You like being a Muslim? Nicole. I love being a Muslim. It's who I am. I'm going out. We just sat down. It's early. You still have a 12 o'clock curfew. Do they have a curfew in Pakistan? I just stay at home. Home is the safest place. You're just gonna sit there in that stupid head thing or you're gonna come with me? I can introduce you to all the shallow losers I go to school with. Have fun. I'm making eggs, Nicole! Why are you yelling? I'm right here. Plastic straws, really? Where are my stainless steel straws? Protein? I hate eggs. I've hated them my entire life, turtle killer. Then I'll eat them. Take note, stainless steel straws. I'm driving to school, you wanna come? Sure. Cool. Thank you so much for the eggs. Have a good day. You too. - Bye. - Bye, sweetie. Eggs were great. Really good.

Grace, right. Do you have a tampon I could borrow? Borrow? Uh, yeah! Fellas. - Mr. Walker. - Mr. Walker. Hi, boys. You know I'm taking you out this year. Oh, you are so cute, Jeff. Well, come on. I ask you out every year. Never gonna happen. Oh, like you think you have a better shot than I do? I'm gonna say yeah. Well, we'll see. Why would you do that? Did you see the way she was looking at me right there? Yeah, but you totally embarrassed me. I'm telling you, this is my year with her. I'm finally gonna get a chance to take her out. She's gonna be my girlfriend. Not if I get to her first. We gotta get her phone number. Do you know someone who knows it? Fail English? I'm gonna fail too. Put together a proposal and see what we can do. Another year of school, another underpaid teacher. How do you keep coming back? I think it's obvious. The great cafeteria food. The jokes are getting old. We're old. Yes, we are. It's coming up on 20 years, Bill. Yep, you're still not getting a raise. Ah. You are getting a new student though, from Pakistan. Maryam Ali. She's... She's a nice kid. Zack, let's go. So I was thinking you should run with me on homecoming court. Really? Yeah. I don't know. You're the one with all the voters. I think that if I vote for you, you'll be good. All right, I'm in. - You're in? - Yeah. - Okay, great. - Might as well, let's do it. Awesome. Sounds good, I'll see you later. - Okay, yeah, I'll see you. - Bye. You see that? What was up with that? You see that? A-E-I-O-U. Nay, nay, nah, no, nu. Hi, this is Maryam Ali reporting live from Pakistan. Hi, this is... A-E-I-O-U. Nay. A-E-I-O-U. Nay, nay, nah, no, nu. Hi, this is Maryam Ali. Hi, this is Maryam Ali. Hi, this is Maryam Ali reporting live from Pakistan. This is Mary Ali. Hi, this is Mary Ali. Hi, this is Mary Adams reporting live. This Mary Adams reporting live from... Hi, this is Mary Adams reporting live from Los Angeles, California here at News Live at Five, where we bring you the absolute best. How long have you been in there? A-E-I-O-U. Diction warmups. I sent in my application to California University for journalism. I'm gonna be a reporter on TV. Muslim girl on TV in America. I can see it. Hey, brown girl. Was your dad a part of 9-11? ISIS called. They're looking for their number one recruit. Her dad wasn't a part of ISIS cuz it was Al-Qaeda. Seriously, guys. Don't be assholes. Dude, you gotta stick up for yourself. They already don't like you. I'm sorry. Hey, let's go, quiet, quiet. Pearl Harbor. Terrorism before it had a name. Do I have any students with relatives still alive that lived through this? My great-grandfather was the same age I am right now during World War II. Was your great-grandfather a kamikaze terrorist? Guys, settle. My great-grandfather was thrown into prison camp just because he looked Japanese. Look Japanese? You are Japanese. No, I'm American. I was born here, just like my great-grandfather. After the Pearl Harbor attack, President Roosevelt ordered 100,000 Japanese put into internment camps. More than half of the Japanese detained were United States citizens. One of them was my great-grandfather, who basically was forced to live in a horse stall. Okay. So if we did it with Pearl Harbor, why didn't we do it with the Muslims after 9-11? This wasn't about any security risk. All Japanese Americans living in the United States were profiled as enemy. That's racial profiling. Maryam Ali? Yes. Okay, so our new exchange student wants to talk about racial profiling. So, what is racial profiling? Someone give me an example. Asians can't drive. Hot girls are sluts. I am not a race. Yes, you are. Cops shooting black people. Okay, good. All Mexicans are in the drug cartel. White guys shooting up churches? Black people are better at rapping. Yeah, but Eminem is still good though. Some of these are stereotypes. There's a difference. There is. So, racial profiling, someone give me an example. All Muslims are terrorists. What does a white boy from Hermosa Beach know about racial profiling? My dad hates Muslims. But I don't think all Muslims are terrorists. And I don't think all jocks are stupid. Listen, 9-11's coming up, so be aware. I'm Zack. I'm Maryam, the terrorist. I don't believe that. Let's leave this dumb jock to his one brain cell. Bye, Maryam. Just call me Mary. What's wrong with Maryam? Nothing, I guess. Mary? It's easier. Okay, Mary, what are you gonna do with all American Zack? I don't know. I have an idea. Take that thing off your head. He didn't seem to have a problem with it. Oh, shit, it's America's future. Shoot me. Oh, shut up, weirdo. So what's your excuse for hanging out with this towelhead freak? I'm not wearing a towel on my head. Oh, I'm sorry, she meant dishrag. It's called hijab. It's part of our culture. You ever take that thing off? Yes, at night. Then maybe people wouldn't stare. I don't mind if they stare. Are people's lives that unoriginal and boring? Well, we don't like looking at it. Take it off. If I were ever to take it off, it wouldn't be because some meathead chick told me to do so. Give it back! Mr. Walker, they're beating up the new raghead girl in the locker room. Go to the field. This is horrible! All right, that's it! Oh my god. No, you need to go back to wherever you came from, okay? Oh my god, like I'm gonna- - Hey! What's going on? Let's go, on the field. You guys can beat each other up out there. Yes, Mr. Walker. Meathead chick? How'd you come up with that one? Google. Good one, I'll see you outside. Hey, raghead. What did you call me? You heard me. I did. It's offensive, right? Highly. Well, maybe if you took it off, people wouldn't call you that. Or you could tell the students to stop the name calling. That might help. Could you please leave? I'm changing! Come in. Hey, Dad. Hey, girls. What can I do for you? Maryam was called a raghead today. I'm sorry, what? Maryam was called a raghead. I apologize. Sorry, boys at this age can be ignorant. It was from a teacher. I will have a conversation with Mr. Walker. You know, I'm thinking about not wearing my hijab anymore. Maybe if I stop wearing it, then all these people would stop giving me all this attention. It's up to you. Wear it or don't, I'll support it. Own it. Come on, own it. Own it. I'm a Muslim. Say it, come on. I am a Muslim. I'm a Muslim. Yeah, you are! Come on, I am a Muslim. I am a Muslim. - Yeah. - I'm a Muslim! That's right. I'm proud of being a Muslim. I'm so proud of being a Muslim! Let's run into the water. Run into the water. Catch the sunset, into the water! For once, Dad, I wish I could just sleep in and not be here so early. The early bird gets the worm. That is so fifth grade. You know, if I want a worm, I'll just take it. Any time of day. You're like a big bird. You cannot call an 18 year old student a raghead, Bob. I was just showing her an example of why people say what they say when she wears that thing. It's called a hijab. I don't care what it's called! Sit down. Sit. Look, you and I both know that bullying is a serious problem in schools. Ours included. Teen suicide is real. Now the last thing I need is a teacher who's a bully. The fact of the matter is, I can't tell her to take that thing off. Yes, you can. They brought down our towers. Bob, Maryam Ali is a little girl. She didn't bring down the towers. Extremists did. There's a big difference. Hijab. Not a rag or a towel. First off, I don't wanna bomb the school. This thing on my head is not a rag or a towel. This is called a hijab. It does not just apply to clothes, but it is a state of mind, behavior, and lifestyle. It celebrates a desirable quality called haya, which means modesty. We wear it so people can see us for our personality and not by the way we look. I have testimony I'd like to share with you by Nadir Osman. "I actually started to wear it when I was about six years old and that was a terrible time to start wearing it because that's when 9-11 happened. It was the first time I'd ever heard the word terrorist. I was like, 'Mom, I was called a terrorist today by another student. What does that mean?'" This innocent girl thought that she was embracing her culture when actually she was being perceived as a terrorist due to a group of men that use religion as an excuse for violence. Maryam, this was an assignment on terrorism, not personal wardrobe. Oxford defines terrorism as the systematic use of terror, especially as a means of coercion. Terror is defined as the state of intense fear. So when someone of any color bullies me for wearing my hijab, that is terrorism. We have a breaking story. There has been some sort of explosion. We don't fully know the details as of yet. A plane that hit- - Apparently, a plane has just crashed- - Then there was a loud explosion- - In New York City just a few moments ago. I love the ocean. Waves are wild and restless, sometimes angry. Are you angry? What's the point of being angry? Well, I like to come here and yell. So no one can hear you? Exactly. Come on, try, try, try. Like actually. It feels good, come on, let it all out. Oh god, that feels really good. - Doesn't it? - Yeah. Don't take my picture. Why? You're beautiful. You know that, right? Can I see you with your hair down? Someday. I'm cool with someday. Where were you born? Pakistan. My mom was Persian, my dad's Pakistani. Okay. Okay? My dad says that when he doesn't know what to say. Well, I've never had a real conversation with a girl outside of Hermosa Beach. So, I know how boring that sounds. Do you like school? Well, I need Bs or higher to get into Cal U. So I just gotta maintain that average. They don't just hand out scholarships to great baseball players, so. So you're saying you're great. I don't like compliments. I don't like boys who don't know how to take compliments. Okay, give me more, please. What are you thinking about? My mother. She died in a terrorist attack. I remember that day, unfortunately. It was a beautiful beach day. My mother was telling me why she named me Maryam. Maryam means passing through the ocean or bitterness of the ocean. Bitterness? But the ocean's so beautiful. Passing through the ocean will lead you to the pearl of the ocean. There's pearls in the ocean? Yes, and you are one of them. You are special pearl, my beloved star of the sea. And I have a surprise for you. For me? Yes. It's beautiful, just like you. Thank you. I love you, Mama. I love you. Okay, we're late. We have to go. Wait, Mama? I want to be just like you when I grow up. No, you wanna be just like you. We rushed to the mosque and took our shoes off before going inside. "I forgot my necklace," I said. My mother wanted to go back with me. I said, "Mama, I'm a big girl, I can go by myself." She smiled as I ran off. "Maryam, your shoes!" She went inside. That was the last time I saw her. I heard a loud explosion. Mama, Mama? I looked back and saw a cloud of smoke. People were screaming. Then silence. I couldn't hear anything. I couldn't hear anything. Where were you? Beach. Told you I don't want you hanging around her. She has a name, Dad. It's Maryam. I like her. She's not like everyone else, you know? Exactly. She's a Muslim. I got nothing against 'em, I just don't want 'em hanging around my son. Do you know what casual or unconscious racism is? I don't need an education on racism. I'm not a racist. So ingrained in people, they don't even know they're doing it. Doing what? Maryam is not an extremist. There's a big difference. And hey, we got KKK, right? They hate Jews and blacks. Should we hate them or forgive them? That's different. Why? Because they're white people? Hate is hate. And Maryam is a strong, intelligent, caring person. And if anyone should be angry or defensive, it should be her. Because she's the minority up against the struggle every day. Somehow she's the one who shows me that people are just people despite what they wear or the color of their skin. She uses reason instead of violence and ignorance. I'm just saying, why can't you date a nice white girl? That is so racist. You can't let what happened to Mom make you like that. Don't you talk about her. You don't even know. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't mean, I didn't mean to say that. I'm sorry. Here. What? Here. What's this? You're going to California University on a full baseball scholarship. You opened it? Sorry. You opened it. Zack. Zack. Hey. Hey. So this is Fesenjan and this is Tahdig. Fesenjan and Tahdig? Let me serve you some of this. So the Tahdig is the crispy rice. It's the best part. All right. This is the Fesenjan. Fesenjan. It's the best chicken piece. Yummy. This is how you eat it. Just take the spoon. Boom, you don't need a knife. So easy. Like that? Yeah, just go like this. And what's that? Noon, or naan. It's bread, try it. It's like Pakistani pita or something? Yeah, it's like pita in Pakistan, India, Iran. Wow, that's... Do you, do you like it? Yeah, it's interesting. You know, I've never had anything like it before. You don't like it. No, it was great. I can make hamburgers, I can make pasta. There's some on the shelf. No. See? So this is kind of weird. What? It's like a first date. I guess. So... Nicole still pissed about you stealing her room? Nicole hasn't been around much. Do you think it's because of me? No, no. That's just Nicky. She's always out and about, you know? I don't think I ever told you, but we actually kind of grew up together. Yeah? She used to come over all the time and we'd stay up all night playing video games, watching stupid movies and stuff. She was like the cool older sister I never had. So your dad and Principal White are best friends? Yeah, I guess Bill is my dad's only friend. Pretty sad. Yeah. He's made a lot of stupid decisions. Know if my mom was still around, she... Your mom? You know, that... That speech, that speech you did was great. Thanks, I worked really hard on it. It showed. Students were actually interested for once. I hope your dad will like me now. Yeah, I hope so. I really don't know why the way I look bothers him. Just ignore everything he says. That's what I do. I don't know. What do you mean you don't know? Are you just dating me to make your dad mad? Why would you say that? It's just a question. Stupid one. Okay. Okay. What your dad says when he doesn't know what to say, right? Okay. Yeah? So where's our next date gonna be? Oh. Roller skating? Bowling. I really wanna go bowling, please, please, please, please, please, please, please. I'm a pretty good bowler, so. You're not gonna get any compliments. It's fine, I don't need 'em. Maybe we should just skip all the bullshit and get married. You're crazy, you know that? Love makes people crazy. And I'm voting for you for homecoming queen. Stop, Zack, that's so embarrassing! It's too late. Be embarrassed, whatever. You're gonna win, I know it. Homecoming queen. Could you imagine? Good morning, Bob. Bill. I think the bell already rang. Might wanna get to class. It did. Cheers. You good? Oh, I'm good. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. Do you have any plans this weekend or? I'm free this weekend if you wanna hang out. Yeah, I think I'm gonna hang out with some of my older friends. Oh, I have a couple of older friends. Some college kids, you know? My parents might not be, we can watch a movie or... Oh, hello. Boys. Do you know the definition of assault? An act either criminal or tortious that threatens physical harm to a person, whether or not actual harm is done. So you know better. You tore the new girl's head scarf off. It's called a hijab. I learned about that in class. Okay, I'm sorry I messed her hair up. I'm suspending you. What? What about Amber? Who told on me? Do you enjoy being mean? Excuse me? Go home and think about what you did. I know what I did. Oh, and you're also out of the running for homecoming court. What? No, no, you can't do that. It's my senior year. Well, maybe you should have thought about that before you shoved an innocent girl into a locker. Why is Maryam even here anyway? Pack up your locker now and go home. Your suspension starts today, Ms. Smith. I've come to collect my paper. A D? This paper was way better than a D. I didn't think so. What, do you think 'cause you're diverse and different, teachers are just gonna give you grades? No, I study, I prepare. I'm always overprepared. I have work to do. So this isn't about grades. I'm sorry. I have never in my entire school life got a grade below B and I don't intend to start now because a certain teacher has a problem with the color of my skin and the hat I wear. Please address this. I'm sorry for not knocking. That was very rude. I forgot my bag. Do you believe in God? Why wouldn't I? Do you believe those murderers that flew those planes into the Twin Towers believed in God? Those Arabs do not represent who I am. With all due respect, I think it would help to let the past go. People jumping from windows 'cause that was a better way to die than burning up. This was an intentional act on American soil. Makes it personal, one year ago or 50 years ago, don't you think? I do think. I can imagine. Oh, you can imagine? Listen, Maryam, I'm not interested in letting 9-11, 2001 go ever. Not going to be one of those Americans that walks around feeling sorry for himself, but I will live on guard. I choose to live for today and tomorrow. Muslims aren't gonna stop being Muslims and Christians aren't gonna stop being Christians. You and me, with all our differences, is it possible that we can just work together? Stay away from my son. You know what, I love your son. No, you don't. Yes, I do. Do you really think a university's gonna judge his athleticism differently if they find out that he's dating a Muslim girl? What do you know about losing someone? You're white, Mr. America. I know everything about losing someone. I lost my wife on 9-11. I lost my mom to a Muslim extremist. I know firsthand, as do you. May God give us peace, happiness. Oh my God. Aren't you that senior that got suspended? Scarlet, right? You won homecoming like every year. What is this? The Muslim, Maryam, was added to the court. Says who? Says this flyer. Okay, what is happening? First she comes here and then she takes away my homecoming? Took away your homecoming by assaulting Maryam. Oh, so it was you who told on me, Zack. What does it matter? Still did it. Should we tell Maryam about what happened last summer? It happened once. We were drunk. What does it matter? We still did it. Okay. Why are you even here? Tell me why I was the only one who was suspended and now I have no homecoming. Jesus, get over yourself. You won the last three years. Why does no one get this? This is my senior year! It's her senior year too. She deserves it way more than you do. You know what, Zack? You are the only one who wants to get inside Maryam's pants. I don't understand why you're dating her. You could have anyone in the school and you choose her? Why? You know what, Scarlet? Maybe if you were nice to one person, just one, maybe someone would like you for you. Instead, you're a sad, hopeless, little mean girl throwing all your insecurities at everyone else. You don't like Nicole because she's gay. You don't like Maryam because she's a raghead. And now me because I'm dating her? Is there anything you like about yourself? First week of school and it's already old. The hot bully. So cliche. Have fun being suspended. Screw you, Zack. Have fun committing social suicide by dating your new loser girlfriend. You can have the dirty Muslim! I just wanna apologize for opening up your letter. I'm sorry. It's just a piece of paper. Zack, it's a scholarship. I haven't verbally accepted. Why wouldn't you? You know, on Christmas, remind me to open up all your presents. Okay, I get it, Zack. I'm sorry, I messed up. I've already apologized. I'm sorry. So what do you want? Well, she stopped by my classroom. Why are you talking to Maryam? I just want you to be careful. Why? Well, for one, she told me she loves you. I don't believe she'd tell you that. She probably didn't mean it. What's that supposed to mean? It means you're young, Zack. You both are young. You met this girl a week ago. Her name's Maryam. Maryam, you met Maryam like a week ago. It's a full ride, Zack. It's a full scholarship. Can't you see that? And you're gonna throw it all away 'cause you think you're in love? You wanna talk to me about love? Do you know you have never once told me that you love me? Zack, let me help you at least. Just don't. Stay away from me. Hi. I don't care what he says, I'm not going to college. Why? Because that's what he wants. I'm sure he has some good in him. Maybe before my mom died, I wouldn't know. I know, he told me. Why wouldn't you tell me that after all that I told you? I never even met her. I was barely a year old. She went on a business trip to New York, never came home. You know, I used to hear my dad crying all night from my room, talking to my mom. Sometimes, I'd really think she was there in the room with him. 'Cause I wanted to. Give me some false hope we could be a family. Every morning after I'd wake up, he'd be sitting in front of the TV, empty beer cans everywhere, screaming the most disgusting shit about ragheads and God knows what. But after a while, his screaming stopped sounding like screaming. All I could hear was him crying for help. I tried to help him. I thought I should because he'd lost the most important person in his life. He never once thought that maybe I needed help too. Maybe I was important too. He never gave me the chance to be a son. I never got the chance to have a mother. I know it sounds stupid, I... I just feel like a boy who never got to be a boy. I've never seen a boy in you. Here, Zack. Stop, please. Zack, please. I'm leaving. Come on, can't we just talk? There's nothing to talk about. Here. At least take this with you. No, I don't want it. Let's go. Got a minute? I need a place to stay. Well, where's your father? Sure. Maybe we can invite the entire school. Make it a sleepover. That's a joke. You sleep on the couch. I understand. I've known your dad my whole life. I've got this. Amber's helping Eddie for your homecoming campaign. Amber, "throw me to the locker" Amber? Yes. Maybe it's her way of saying sorry. Okay. You know I don't care about homecoming. You know it's happening whether you like it or not. Stop. Vote for Maryam. And Eddie. Yeah, and Eddie. Eddie, I'm not gonna vote for you. It's gonna be the best homecoming yet. So stoked, it's gonna be awesome. Hey, excuse me, vote for Eddie. Thanks for your vote. Any left? Hey, I handed out all the flyers. - Thank you. - Thanks. You know, I'm really glad that you're here. And I'm sorry about detention. It sucks. Well, I deserved it. Maryam didn't do anything but wear a hijab. And people are afraid of what they don't understand. I guess, yeah. Sorry about you and Scarlet. Yeah, we've been friends a long time. It's just, I'm done being a follower. I never wanted to be a bully. It's just every time I was with her, I would follow along, and then afterwards I would really feel not good. I just don't get mean people. Like, it takes so much energy. Why not just be nice? You know? Yeah. You blocked me, Amber? I texted you like 10 times. Whatever. Here to get my stuff because apparently I'm the only bad guy in all of this. I got detention, Scarlet, and I'm fine with it. Oh yeah? Well, I got suspended and I'm not fine with it. You're helping Maryam now? I asked her to. This is a lot of work. First day of school, I lied through my teeth when I said I'd vote for you. You are not good enough to stand by me. What are you doing, Scarlet? Come on, man, don't take pictures of that. Get these students to class. Bill! Who did this? Scarlet, this is too far. Shut up, Zack. There are a lot of cruel people in this world who will do far worse things than slam you into a locker. Consider yourself lucky. Happy homecoming. I'm sorry. It'll be okay. Just stop, don't. No, no, let me go, Zack! What? What, you think this is funny? You all just stood around and let this happen? You watched her do this? Eddie. There was nothing we could do, man. Amber? Grace. Zack, what's going on? You see this? You know about this? No. You're all guilty. - All right, guys. - Who did this, who did this? Everyone, go back to class right now. Why did you do it? Why did you do it? Why? No words? You had plenty to say the other day when you tore the hijab off my head. Say something! Say something! Say something. When I was a kid, I used to love playing outside. It was my happy place. I loved breathing in the fresh air, pretending I was in some imaginary world. Just a barefoot kid running around, free as a bird. It was beautiful. My parents were too busy fighting inside to notice. Mom would cry. Dad would hit her. So she left. I remember one day, I... I chased this butterfly into my neighbor's yard. He was selling lemonade. Alone. He asked me where my parents were and I told him that they were inside fighting. He invited me in his house to cool off, so I did. After he gave me some lemonade, he said that he could tell my eyes were irritated from the swimming pool and he offered me these eyedrops to help with the redness. I agreed. Felt nice to be taken care of like that. But the second he dropped them in, my eyes started to burn and the room went black and I could feel his hands moving up my legs. And then, I felt his disgusting mouth in a place it did not belong. After it was all over, he told me not to tell anyone. And for some reason I didn't. The man still lives across the street from me. Just the other day, I saw him selling lemonade. And you were scared to speak up. He destroyed me. He molested your body. He cannot molest your soul. I want to kill him. You can't do that. Why not? He killed me. I have to go. You should leave. Dad! It's Zack's. I told him he could stay here for a while until he and Bob work things out. I told him you wouldn't mind sleeping on the couch downstairs. I do mind, he can sleep on the couch. He's too big, honey. His feet will hang off the end. First Maryam and now Zack, you're helping everyone else but me. I found this in your room. You went through my room? That's my stuff, that's my personal stuff! Why didn't you tell me? Because it isn't true. Bill, stop. Let her talk. I'm gay, Mom. Why didn't either of you tell me? I didn't wanna hurt you. What do you expect from us? Bill. It's in the Bible. It's an abomination. It's a disease. Funny, that's what the police said. Honey, I think what your father is trying to say is we can hate the act, but still love the person. Act, I'm not a circus clown. Look, it's just a part of what makes me up. I don't have a choice. Yes, you do. God gives you a choice. I can be a Christian and be gay. Not in this household. Nicole! My daughter is not a disease. What's up, man? Nothing, man, I'm good. You're good? Bro, you've been acting off lately, okay? We've all noticed. You're the captain of our team. Our team. We need you, man. Yeah, I know, man, I'm sorry, okay? Just a lot going on right now, you know? Yeah, I know. I just don't know how much more of this I can handle. It's your dad, huh? Yeah, I just can't get away from him for a second. You know, school, baseball, years of it. And now Maryam. You know, I never even liked baseball? What do you mean you never liked baseball? Well, my dad loves it. You know, he played it in college and tried out for the Dodgers and thought I could be something like that. What do you, hold on, hold on. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Your dad tried out with the Dodgers? Yeah, man. That's insane. He didn't make it, you know. That's like my dream, to play with the Dodgers. Do you know what that means? That's insane. Yeah. Well, that's my problem, man. It's not my dream. I'd rather be on some beach in a shack, just playing guitar. You play guitar? No. Yeah, I didn't, I didn't think so. Well, I mean, you could learn. Yeah. Guess I could. Well, hey, listen. I know your dad doesn't like the whole Maryam thing. Yeah. But just know it's cool, okay? She's cool. And I got your back. Thanks, man, I really appreciate it. Yeah. You guys make out yet? - No. - Oh! And now he's back, there he is. With a smile and everything. So I caught you. Yes. Yeah, all right. Finally. Now stop crying. Let's get some lunch. - Okay, okay. - All right, let's go. Wasn't crying. No, I saw you crying. Can I stay in Zack's room? Why not? Just like old times. Really, the whole bottle? Parents don't care, why should I? It's bad for your liver. So is walking in front of a car. Give me the bottle. Give it. Let's go for a walk. God. So what happened? You ever feel like an alien? I feel like an alien all the time. You really hate Maryam, huh? No. Called her a raghead. I did. I'm sorry. Don't tell me. Bob. You know what I see when I look at Maryam? An explosion of color and life. She's like a beautiful flower. If you don't wanna see beauty in a flower, you won't. But I see what's on the inside, specks of green and yellow, washes of blues and purples. It's an explosion of life. Can't help but stare. So beautiful, it makes you wanna like cry. I don't ever feel like a beautiful flower. Not allowed to. I'm more like a cactus. It's cool to look at, but you don't want to touch it. Did you tell Maryam this? She doesn't like me the way I like her. You tell your parents you like girls? I tried. Try harder. Straight white male is gonna tell me to try harder in coming out to my conservative Christian parents? Yeah. It's okay to be a little different. That's the nicest thing anybody's ever said to me. I do have a heart. If you could accept me all these years, why can't you accept Zack and Maryam? Guess I give everybody else advice, just can't take it for myself. Try harder. Can I help you? I'm Scarlet Smith. Hi. You don't remember me? Yeah, I think I know you. I live across the street. Right. Right, yeah. Hi, Scarlet. I've grown up now, haven't I? Yeah, I'd... I'd offer you some lemonade, but... Why did you touch me? I don't think I did that. Yes, you did. My name is Scarlet. I just started my senior year at Hermosa Beach High. I am the most pretty. I am the most popular. I never wanted any of this. I just wanted someone to talk to. Mr. Bill. Mr. Principal Bill. I'm sorry for ripping the new girl's headscarf off. No, I'm sorry for ripping Maryam's hijab off. I know I was wrong and I'm here- - What are you doing? Practicing an apology. Well, the bell just rang and we're gonna be late. I'm just... I'm nervous, okay? I've gotta go in there and talk to Principal Bill about all this. Well, Principal White is not gonna come to you. You're right. I'm just scared. You know, I've never apologized for anything. I'll go with you. You will? Mm-hm. I'm sorry. Don't worry. We're good. Let's go. Okay. I have something for you. What? What is it? It's a pearl from the ocean. There are pearls in the ocean? Lots. Come on, let's go. Close your eyes. An elephant or a zebra. But think about, let's put the tree, one stem. Like don't think about dirt. It's an even, it's an equal race. Hey, guys. Hey, everyone. I just wanted to say that I'm really sorry for everything I've done and I'm here to make things right. But of course I realize my reputation can't just change in one day. So... Can I, can I help you guys with anything? I'd love to contribute. These need stapling. Okay, thanks, Grace. Bring it in. Okay. So we were saying by the... What did you say to her? Nothing. I listened. It's called literature, dumb-ass. Oh my gosh. See, getting cheated. Everyone's, everyone's always throwing shade. Yeah, you can't go wrong. I'm becoming more Zen. Yeah, I found this. Okay, cool. Your mother was a strong woman. Stubborn. Which made her even more beautiful, 'cause she was usually right. She used to wear her hair in this ponytail 'cause it got in the way of her gardening. She would plant this little seed into the ground and it would turn into this like thing of colors. I'm not a flower kind of guy. Death is supposed to get easier, dealing with it. People tell you "Just let it go." I can't. It's hard. So I take it out on you. I wish I could just let things go. You lost your wife, your love, but I lost a mother. You think I sleep easy? You think I just put that away? 'Cause I never met her? You don't think it hurts me too? I'm sorry. You're stuck in my own selfish pain. She was my flower. Love needs water. I guess the bucket just dried up. Bob the racist is getting all sensitive. It's pathetic. I just want a dad. I just want a son. You punched me in the face. I know. Felt pretty good. Yeah, I bet it did. Today is September 11th. It is. I love you, boy. I love you, Dad. There we go, that's a tripler. Look at that, that's a pro athlete right there. Stay down, nice. Looking good. There you go. That's a good right arm. Now, gonna hang. All right, go for a run. Maryam. Is this an A for apology? It's an A for excellence. I never was a good speller. A-E-I-O-U, A-E-I-O-U. A-E-I-O-U. Nay, nay, nah, no, nu. Irish wristwatch, Irish wristwatch, Irish wristwatch. Hi, hi, hi. Hi.
