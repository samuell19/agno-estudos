(ALBERTO IMITATING BIRD CALL) (BIRD CALLS) (CONTINUES IMITATING BIRD CALL) (BIRD CONTINUES CALLING) Watch out. I'm about to become Tarzan. (GRUNTS) ALAN GARCIA: To grow, Peru needs to expand its markets. We need larger investments in mining, oil and gas. That's why I invite you to invest in Peru. American entrepreneurs, bring your factories here. Come! You can trust that we'll have long term stability. We won't have any political conflicts. If I were a member of the American Chamber of Commerce, -I would invest in Peru. -(AUDIENCE LAUGHS) -Of course I would! -(AUDIENCE CLAPPING) (ALBERTO WHISTLING TUNE) I broke it. -Alberto is here. -(ALBERTO SINGING) Mmm! ALBERTO: I love the jungle. I love the Amazon. Because this is what I know. This is where I'm from. I grew up in a collective environment. Where we all enjoy what the earth gives us. My father always told me that the earth was borrowed. It's not given to you to do what you please with. When you borrow something, you must care for it, even more than its owner. We must hand it to the future generations in even better condition. You see that pond? There used to be river dolphins there. I used to play with those river dolphins. (EXCITED CHATTERING) MAN: (ENUNCIATING) We love... our... Peru. ALBERTO: Good morning, teacher. Can I say hello to the kids? (SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE) My son's name means Waterfall. And you? Stand up. ALBERTO: Native people have always followed the principle to not plunder nature. Rather, we respect it. Our territories are sacred to us. Our territory is the seed of our existence. Without our territories we can't live. (CHILD SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) I caught some prey in the forest. (SPEAKING IN OTHER LANGUAGE) I could've hunted more animals if I had more time. ARUWIHTU: Yes, my son. Other regions have more animals, but not here. MAN: We used to have lots of animals. They used to roam by the river bed. MAN: There is nothing now. ANDER: This is the North Peru Pipeline. Look at how bad it is. All submerged under water and mud. Now you'll see the damage the crude oil is causing in our region. (CHAINSAW WHIRRING) You can see that the crude went all the way up to here. It leaves your hand black. Down here there's also a lot of crude. In winter the crude will float back up to here. And our fish feed from these plants. NURSE: The majority of our patients have headaches, nausea, dizziness. It's because the oil spills have contaminated our water. Our water contains many toxic metals that are harming our people. ALBERTO: The communities that have been exposed have lead and cadmium in their blood. They are condemned to die. The accumulation of money and wealth... We call that kind of development "savage." Because, whether you want or not, you kill the rainforest. You kill a culture. You kill an entire people. (HELICOPTER BLADES WHIRRING) ANCHORWOMAN: (ON TV) President Alan Garcia traveled all the way to Paiche Sur where the Barrett Company will exploit one of the largest oil discoveries in our country. Very exciting. This guarantees our future and opens new possibilities for our nation. ANCHORWOMAN: The government's goal is to make Peru an exporter of steel, natural gas, oil and minerals. One, two, three... Peru! VLADIMIR PINTO: President Garcia wanted to promote big investment in the Amazon, but the native communities presented an obstacle. At one point he calls their territories a waste. So better to have private companies buy their land. (CROWD CHEERING) REPORTER: President Alan Garcia left for the U.S. to promote the Free Trade Agreement, full of optimism and high expectations. I'm very optimistic. I believe the FTA will be a great step forward for our country. MAN: President Garcia enacted a series of laws to facilitate the Free Trade Agreement with the U.S. Among them were laws that affected all the native Amazonian communities. PINTO: With these laws he tried to get rid of indigenous communal land. Or at least weaken it as much as possible. Some of the laws were specifically meant to eliminate their communal property. These laws gave private companies the right to exploit rainforest resources without the permission or consultation of local native communities. The companies were getting a blank check. REPORTER: The Free Trade Agreement with the U.S. is now a reality. President Garcia signed the agreement this afternoon. ALBERTO: For us, our land can never be sold. We don't negotiate with our land. And that's what Garcia's government doesn't understand. How are you, brother? I'm here. How are you? (EXCITED CHATTERING) How are you doing? Nice to meet you. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) (CHANTING) ALBERTO: They tell you, "Here, have some money "so that we can extract oil and gold from your territory." You'll have money for two or three years. And then what? Nothing. Your river contaminated. Your territory contaminated. Nothing left. Only death. Is that what we want? MAN: No... no. Why does Alan Garcia want to sell our territories? He should sell his palace. -Extract oil from there. -(WOMAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) Extract gold from there. Why is he coming to screw us over? (WOMAN SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE) ALBERTO: But we can't run away. Our ancestors taught us to defend our land. Our grandparents and parents fought for the rights of our territory. Because we're nothing without our land. And the Convention 169 states very clearly, that our people have the right to decide our own priorities. The right to live in peace. The right to live in a dignified land. (CHATTING INDISTINCTLY) MAN: Peru is a signatory to International Convention 169, which mandates that when the government wants to pass a law that affects native people's rights it must consult with them first. This wasn't done. On top of that, the laws were unconstitutional. The constitution establishes that native territories are inalienable. MAN: (ON MIC) Let's welcome the president of our national organization... -(CROWD CLAPPING) -Mr. Alberto Pizango. I'm a community leader born and raised in this area. My parents raised me drinking pure water, breathing clean air, eating fresh food. I would give my life to protect our land, our water, our air. Now that you're here, listen to us, leader Alberto. Take our message to the government of Peru. Please tell them that we exist, that we are also Peruvians. -We're indigenous but we are also Peruvians. -(AUDIENCE CLAPPING) ALBERTO: What are the native communities asking for? Justice. That our rights be respected. That our territory and traditions be respected. MAN 1: Hello. I wanted to give you information about the protest. MAN 2: (ON RADIO) We're getting organized. We know we can fill more than four boats with people. But it'll probably be more like 15 boats. (BELL TOLLING) (CROWD CHANTING) (CLAPPING AND WHISTLING) ALBERTO: This is a peaceful national protest in our ancestral territories. We demand that the government immediately repeal the laws violating our fundamental rights. (EXCLAIMING) Ethnic groups in the Amazon have gone on strike. They reject a number of laws that they believe threaten their lands. MALE REPORTER 1: Protests have sprung up in four Amazonian regions, they are waiting for the government's response. FEMALE REPORTER: Meanwhile, the city of Iquitos was the scene of the largest gathering of native people ever. MALE REPORTER 2: More than 500 natives arrived in traditional attire to demand their rights. It's the native communities, themselves, that have not been heard by this government. MAN: We have two strongholds here. About 3,000 people. Awajun and Wampis natives, and Spanish speakers too. There are no natives in Congress to speak for us. Only rich people that protect the interest of transnational companies. AIDESEP follows the people's mandate. We're simply the spokesmen for the decisions of our indigenous brothers. The native people have decided that this protest will go on until the government addresses our demands. (CROWD CHANTING) We ask that the government meet with us immediately to avoid any regrettable consequences. When we have resources like oil, gas and lumber and abundant fishing in the Amazon that can give work to many people. That doesn't belong just to the group who had the good fortune to be born there. The Amazon belongs to you and your children. It belongs to the whole nation. The riches of Peru belong to all Peruvians and should be enjoyed by all of us. -(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING) -Long live Peru! RADIO HOST: We're speaking today with Alberto Pizango, president of AIDESEP. They are protesting. Tell us what's going on. We don't oppose development. We're always demonized. We're called troublesome. Savages that don't understand progress. That's why they think we're obstacles to development. That's not true. We want the country to progress, but without putting lives at risk. (INDISTINCT CHATTERING) Over there. MAN: You can't go through! Don't let him pass! Highway patrol. This group will stand here and not move. Due to the roads blockaded by native people thousands in San Martin are suffering shortages of basic goods and services. Indigenous groups have blocked the Belaunde Terry highway. In a show of strength, protesters also took the main road in Yurimaguas. They used logs to block it. Some set up camp on the road itself. SIMON: Trucks were at a standstill throughout the Amazon. Regional governments were asking for a resolution to the problem because the blockage was causing a good shortage. I headed an executive commission to meet with the native peoples represented by Alberto Pizango. We met over the course of several days. The State has neglected Amazonian native communities for centuries. President Garcia's government will end this neglect from this day forward. We'll review the laws, and we'll change whatever parts affect our native brothers. We'll eliminate the specific parts that affect them but without hurting our country. Rest assured that we will come to a permanent solution. We proposed to identify which specific articles they didn't like. Okay, let's move forward. What specific parts do you want eliminated? But all they kept saying was, "Repeal the laws. Repeal the laws." It was that or nothing. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) MAN: Here they come. We've had a productive meeting. However, we still don't have an agreement. But as I said, the talks have been positive. And we hope to have concrete results in the next few hours. (REPORTER SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) That's all I can say for now. MAN: They were leading us on. How can we accept changes when you made these laws behind our backs? We weren't consulted. And they are unconstitutional. Therefore, they must be repealed. We can't expect to resolve this immediately. We would be lying to ourselves. We need a long-lasting solution that will benefit our country. Mr. Pizango, will the protest continue? That's all we can tell you. We'll have more news tomorrow. Thank you. REPORTER: Mr. Pizango, will the protests continue? Hundreds of natives with spears, painted faces and native dress have surrounded PetroPeru Station No. 6 in Loreto. FERNANDO URIZAR: People from native communities started to arrive. They came by river, on boats, from very remote regions. They wanted to take over an important place to get the government's attention. In our region, it was Station No. 6. We coordinated with the station manager to close the pipeline. -We thought this would put pressure on the government. -(CROWD SHOUTING) Because they knew we supplied oil to the entire country. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) Here with us tonight is the President of AIDESEP, Alberto Pizango. Good evening, Mr. Pizango. Thank you for this opportunity to... You have taken over PetroPeru's pipeline. If the gas lines are compromised Lima could be without electricity and collapse. And yet you still refuse to stop the protests? This wouldn't have happened if the government had listened to our demands. We raised our concerns before the laws went into effect. Don't you realize that you're putting the entire country at risk? But what about the rights of the indigenous people? We're also Peruvians. You're taking a big risk with your community, Mr. Pizango. An eviction of the protestors is imminent. The country can't stop just for you. (SIGHING) The rule of law protects the companies. But it never protects the territorial rights of the indigenous people. -(CHUCKLES) -I'm not gonna be without lights just because you don't want to dialogue. No one in the city will. Thank you. And I hope you'll be more open to dialogue. We are open to dialogue. It doesn't seem that way. Thank you. MALE REPORTER: The protest has been going on for more than a month, and there's no solution in sight. When are we going to stop protesting? The answer is with the President. If they repeal the laws today we'll leave. Any problem can be solved if there's political will. We'll remain here until the final consequences. GARCIA: These people don't have crowns. These people are not first class citizens. 400,000 natives can't tell 28 million Peruvians that, "You don't have any right to come here." No way. It's like they want to take us back to primitive times. The government has been extremely patient until now. But the country cannot have a gun to its head. The government must act with strength to restore order. The people maintain the State to maintain order. This must end. The government has declared a State of Emergency in four Amazonian regions. This government has always tried to be patient and tolerant. But we can't accept this type of unrest, which tries to weaken our government. We won't allow it. We're fully committed to using our constitutional authority. I only want to speak with the one gentleman. Everyone else stay back. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) Come closer. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) MAN: Let's talk right here. Sir. MAN: Yes? I'm a commander of the Police Special Forces. We agree with your protest and with our complaints. Unfortunately, we can't support you. What we want at this time, is that you leave the bridge peacefully. ALL: (CHANTING) Brothers, policemen! Our fight is not with you! Our struggle is against the government! Brothers of the Military! Our fight is not with you! Alan Garcia is a traitor! POLICEMAN 1: Go that way! Go that way! This way. POLICEMAN 2: Hey, go this way! (SHOUTING) MAN: Grab him! -(POLICEMAN EXCLAIMING) -(MAN GRUNTING) (MAN GROANING) ALBERTO: Just as the President has declared a State of Emergency, we indigenous people are also declaring a State of Emergency inside our territory. Our Central Committee has decided to declare our people in insurgency. (CAMERA SHUTTERS CLICKING) This means we'll only follow our ancestral laws. And any forces that come into our territories will be considered external aggression. Why are you dismissing the dialogue with the government? They must move forward and repeal those laws. Our position has been clear. FEMALE REPORTER: In other words: repeal the laws or death. That's what our people have decided. (SPEAKING SPANISH) He's sending thousands of natives to the guillotine. Natives who only want peace, but they've been lied to. ALBERTO: We don't want violence but if the government thinks we do then we are forced to retract our call for insurgency. However, we will continue our protest because we have the right to do so. POLICE OFFICER: We were 38 policemen, including Commander Montenegro. We were sent to Station No.6 to keep order. URIZAR: But 38 policemen aren't enough when you've got 1,500 people outside. It wasn't enough. (MEN CHANTING) MAN: (ON SPEAKER) Your leaders have told us this is a peaceful protest. Even though we're in a State of Emergency, we want to be respectful. We don't want anyone to get hurt or something worse. We're all Peruvians and we all love our country. We signed an Agreement of Understanding with the police, not to attack each other. Because our fight was against the government. No one else. It's been 50 days since the protests began. And the problem is the same: if the laws are not repealed, the protests will continue. MAN: Since the executive branch had no intentions of resolving the issue, we approached all the different political parties in Congress. One by one, we reached out to every political party. I gotta leave by 11:50 a.m. Send someone to replace me here. Go ahead. Here are our demands. PINTO: One of the most debated laws was Law 1090, the Forestry Law. The Forestry Law allowed for parts of the rainforest to be reclassified from a collective natural resource to become eligible for private sale. -(INAUDIBLE) -MAN: Our native brothers decided that if Law 1090 was repealed, we would end the protest. (SPEAKING IN SPANISH) BELAUNDE: When these laws were being debated in Congress, the government pressured its own party saying that if they changed a single comma or a period in these laws it would cause the entire Free Trade Agreement to fall apart. -(INDISTINCT) -This was a lie. Native lands had nothing to do with the American Trade Agreement. Nothing. That was the great fraud of Alan Garcia's government. Garcia had a majority in Congress. And they acted in support of their President. If he didn't want to repeal the laws, they wouldn't repeal them. I think Congress is taking a good step towards trying to resolve this problem. FEMALE REPORTER: But it's only one of the laws? Yes, it's only one. But we hope that the other contested laws will be deemed unconstitutional. The debate to repeal Forestry Law 1090 will continue. MAN: We'll now vote on a new motion, to suspend all debate on this law until the Executive Commission presents its recommendations. Register your attendance because we're about to vote. Register your attendance. We're voting on the motion. Register your attendance, Congressmembers. Let's close the vote. Thirty-eight votes in favor. Twenty-one against. Nine abstained. The motion to suspend has been approved. Let's move on. MAN: You are playing with the interests of the people. (INDISTINCT SHOUTING) MAN: Order, please! WOMAN: We want a debate. A debate over ideas. MAN: The session began at 9:30 a.m. Everyone knew that. You have to understand that the Amazon is in serious trouble. The entire population has come out to protest. It's not only the natives anymore. Everyone has come out. We're only asking for a democratic debate. If we lose, we lose. If we win, we win. That's how democracy works. But you've got to put it on the agenda. MAN: The subject is closed, Congressman. The government and your party should ask the country for forgiveness, for taking us down a dead-end road! Congressman, we've moved on to another topic. You've won this motion. Fine. But just think about what will happen when the Amazon people find out? With all due respect, we're done with that subject. It's a closed topic, closed here. But it's not closed in the Amazon. (ALL CHANTING) ALBERTO: Our people has hoped that Law 1090 would be repealed today. And we could have immediately suspended our protest. (HELICOPTER BLADES WHIRRING) (GUNSHOTS FIRING) (PEOPLE SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY) They're dead! There are two people dead up there! (INDISTINCT SHOUTING CONTINUES) WOMAN: They're wounded! We're staying right here. If they're gonna kill us, let them kill us right here. Shields up! POLICEMAN: There! The one in the yellow shirt. Get him! Keep moving. (GUNS FIRING) MAN 1: Fucking help us! Help! Water! Water! MAN: He's shot! He's shot! Motherfuckers. Ambulance! (MAN SHOUTING) MAN 2: Taxi, taxi! Help us out! MAN 3: Take him to town! MAN 4: Stop the bleeding. MAN 2: Let's take him. There are many seriously wounded. (INDISTINCT SHOUTING) (GUNS FIRING) We're in the middle of a terrible conflict. They're shooting tear gas all over the place. We don't know what's going on up there. We've heard there are dead and wounded people, but it's impossible to get up there. (GUNSHOTS FIRING) -CAMERAMAN: Someone got injured. -A policeman? CAMERAMAN: Yeah, he might be dead. POLICEMAN 1: Hold his head. WOMAN: Please stop shooting. (SIRENS WAILING) WOMAN: Let's take him! For the honor of our fallen colleagues, we're gonna finish this. For them, because they're watching us. We're going to finish this up. But no one does anything unless I order it! Let's do this right. Let's finish it. What's done is done! Remember our motto... ALL: (SHOUTING) "Never surrender, God damn it!" POLICEMAN 2: I'm gonna burn your camera. Check the ambulances for guns. -Check inside! -(SIRENS WAILING) (INDISTINCT CHATTERING) MAN 1: Drag him out! MAN 2: Get out motherfucker. Take it easy. Take it easy. I don't have anything. He has a gun! MAN: Get him out! Get out of here! Here's the gun he stole. He's been shooting it. POLICEMAN 3: Take his belt off and tie him up. Don't open your mouth or I'll kick your face in, motherfucker. (GUNSHOTS CONTINUE FIRING) MAN: They're aiming at the people! WOMAN: Look out! Get down! Get down! They're going to shoot you! (GUNS FIRING) (SIRENS WAILING) MAN: Move back! Get out of the way! WOMAN: Foreign press! They're not letting us in! REPORTER: El Comercio Newspaper! I want to denounce this act. They've assassinated our brothers. They've killed them. They've shot them down. A piece of paper with laws... The government could've easily torn it up, and written new ones. But a lost life cannot be recovered. From death, no one returns. What a shame that a democratic government is making Peruvians kill each other. There's a warrant out for my arrest. Nevertheless, it's the government that should answer for these assassinations and all that has happened today. FEMALE REPORTER 1: But there are also dead policemen. -Police were killed, Mr. Pizango. -(REPORTERS CLAMORING) Our people were only defending their rights. FEMALE REPORTER 1: And what about the police? Who's responsible for their deaths? It's the President, Alan Garcia. Our brothers were gathered peacefully until the police started to shoot. The people were not armed. MALE REPORTER: So why are the policemen dead? Thank you very much. (CLAMORING) FEMALE REPORTER 2: Are you going to turn yourself in? The government acted as a democratic government should act under the Constitution. We had to finally establish order and discipline in our country. Eleven policemen were assassinated. Five were ambushed and murdered with spears. Four died while trying to retake the road. Eleven assassinated policemen. Eleven! Don't let anyone tell you that the natives are the victims. It's the police who are the victims. Things like this don't just happen by the Grace of God. This happened because there was a conspiracy and an instigator. Mr. Pizango is unequivocally responsible. Maybe not materially responsible, but definitely intellectually responsible. He agitated, pushed, deceived, lied to, and manipulated the natives, by telling them that their lands were already sold and their water was privatized. And that they had to fight to the death. The judicial system should arrest him immediately, so that this criminal, Pizango, can face the full weight of the law. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) What can we do? You must go out and face the press and the police. MAN 1: Any news on the arrest order? Open that door. WOMAN: That way. Close the door. Close the door. (MAN 1 SHUSHING) MAN 2: Go that way. Be careful. (POLICE SIRENS WAILING) (HELICOPTER BLADES WHIRRING) (WOMAN WAILING) (INDISTINCT CHATTERING) (WOMAN CONTINUES WAILING) FEMALE REPORTER: It's 5:18 p.m. Here's the news with Armando Canchaya. CANCHAYA: We have an incoming call to our studio. Good afternoon. MAN: Hello. I'm calling from Imazita. CANCHAYA: Tell us what's going on there. We've taken 38 policemen and their commander hostage at Station No. 6. We've taken them to the mountains. We've done this because our brothers have been gunned down in Bagua. URIZAR: What happened at Station No. 6 was a reaction to Bagua. The radio announced that there was a genocide at the Devil's Curve. It wasn't true. It was an exaggeration. The news infuriated them. Since the wire fence wasn't very strong, they knocked it down. They overtook the guards, and made it inside. I told them in my language... "Brothers, let's not hurt each other." But they ignored their leaders. Everything went out of control. POLICE OFFICER: Nobody had told our commander what had happened at Devil's Curve. So Colonel Montenegro had no idea what was going on. Montenegro said, "Don't worry guys. "I'll fix this by talking to them." But the natives jumped him. They started beating him with sticks and everything they had. They insulted us, "You miserable dogs, this is how you're gonna die." They threw all 38 of us into a warehouse. While we were inside we heard a helicopter circling above. (HELICOPTER BLADES WHIRRING) But it never landed. We lost hope that backup was coming. They said, "Commander, come here." Several hours had already passed. Line your people up and follow us. They took 18 men. (CROWD CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY) CANCHAYA: (ON RADIO) What do you want in exchange? MAN: (ON RADIO) We want the Minister of the Interior to order the police to withdraw. CANCHAYA: What will happen if the authorities refuse your demands? MAN: Unfortunately, the people will execute them. And we can't stop them. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) ANNOUNCER: The National Police Chief will now present the Peruvian flag to the family of Colonel Miguel Montenegro. MAN: Miguel Antonio Montenegro. ALL: We salute you! MAN: Miguel Antonio Montenegro. ALL: We salute you! WOMAN: I'm grateful that I had such a wonderful man in my life. He was a good son, a good brother, a good father. He was a marvelous husband with whom I shared 22 years. This is a very painful moment for all of us who loved you. But we promise to have your strength and to move forward. I want this flower to symbolize peace for everyone. Native brothers, we don't harbor any hatred towards you. If you had known my husband a little better I'm sure that you would have protected him. Because my husband was the most wonderful man any of us could've ever known. Thank you for everything, my love. (TRUMPET PLAYING) GARCIA: I'd like to start by honoring the many policemen who were murdered. They were victims of savagery, barbarism and brutality. Our country has been the victim of a conspiracy aimed at holding us back. Its absurd beliefs are straight out of the 19th century. They gathered their armies in the depths of the rainforest, and in the most backwards parts of our nation. We're still missing the body of one policeman. We're here searching for his body. MALE REPORTER: Do you believe that your son is still alive? I do think he's still alive. If the government has exhausted its search then they need to ask the natives. They know where he is, dead or alive. In the rainforest, there are people who know how to think, feel, love. We've reached this point because we love our land. How else can we be heard? The government says, "You can't take the roads. "You can't do that." I'd like to ask Mr. Alan Garcia, what else can the people do when we keep saying, no, no, no? How can we be heard without taking these measures? This isn't our fault. I mourn the death of the police, and of our native brothers. But the police are called "heroes" because they fought against an enemy. But what does that make us? MAN: Can you come a little closer? WOMAN: We'd like to inform you that we've granted asylum to Mr. Pizango. And we have requested safe passage to take Mr. Pizango from Peru to Nicaragua. We're waiting for the Peruvian authorities to process the request. MAN: He's followed all the protocols to demonstrate that he is being politically persecuted. Asylum was granted in accordance with international laws. FEMALE ANNOUNCER: Good afternoon. We welcome you on flight 4382 to the city of Managua. CABANILLAS: The intellectual mastermind, agitator, coward, has fled. But justice will prevail over him, and those who committed the massacre of the police officers. The Minister of the Interior, Mercedes Cabanillas, is here with us. She's rushed over from a ceremony related to these tragic events. Ten more police bodies arrived today. We're in deep mourning. There are destructive, criminal forces that have driven these men to butcher our brothers, the police. A savage act. Frankly, they are savages. But 15 natives died too. No, I think less than that. The number doesn't matter: Eight, five, nine, 10. There shouldn't have been any. Outside of Peru people believe that the police attacked the natives, that the natives are marginalized and abused. But it's the other way around. This was a political problem right? Well, but I... I'm not talking about you. It wasn't a problem for the police to solve. They had an ideology... Don't forget this explodes on a Friday. That Thursday Congress voted not to repeal Law 1090. The natives thought "This is mockery!" And then the government sends the police. It was like dropping a lit match on gasoline. (CROWD CHEERING) MAN: (OVER SPEAKER) Long live the struggle of the Amazonian people! -Long live the struggle of the Peruvian people! -(CROWD CHANTING) Long live our national sovereignty! Down with transnational companies! Down with Alan Garcia's government! We're united in this national protest! I've heard some legislator say that the law must prevail and that people must support them. I'm asking all of you: Do you believe you own the truth? Or could you be in the wrong? Is it possible that these laws were unconstitutional? We have a moral obligation to the dead. We can't keep sending our policemen brothers to be "cannon fodder." This is a political problem! This Cabinet has its hands stained in blood, and it shouldn't stay on any longer. With all due respect, I won't answer to stupid comments. -(CROWD PROTESTING) -No, ma'am, I won't. MAN 1: Take it back! MAN 2: How can I take it back, when you're saying I've got my hands soaked in blood? Shut your mouth! Let's be decent here. Order! Order! Congressman, you're forcing me to suspend this hearing. The government did not assassinate police officers. The government did not assassinate natives. The judicial system will find the guilty parties. There are dead people. And they should be attributed to the government. Your government will have to carry those deaths for the rest of history. And history will judge you harshly, because all this could've been avoided. I propose to repeal those laws immediately because this government has already lost its moral authority for dialogue. It's time to take stock of what happened. And to recognize the mistakes we've all made, in one way or another. It's true that the original laws were made without consulting the leader of the native communities. But that's because it was believed they had no effect on their communal land. The Prime Minister has decided to start from the beginning to repeal the laws and start a new fresh dialogue so that we can draft brand new laws that will protect our Amazon. I know that growth can raise tension. I've learned that modernizing our country too quickly creates conflicts. Let's not be afraid of change if it moves the nation forward. But let's avoid death and pain. If it does happen, let's rectify, reconcile and restart. That Cabinet has come to a unanimous agreement to repeal these laws. Here is our recommendation to repeal them. (AUDIENCE APPLAUDING) SIMON: I resigned only after I fixed the problem. I didn't run away. And against the will of many, we asked Congress to annul these laws. Only after I resolved the problem I took my political responsibility. Someone had to be politically accountable. (PEOPLE CLAMORING) MAN: Please, Congressmembers, we're going to close the vote. Sixty-six in favor, -(APPLAUSE) -Twenty-nine against and zero abstained. ALBERTO: I grieve so much, it hurts me to the bottom of my heart that people lost their lives. That lives were lost. It shouldn't have happened. It should never happen again. (BIRDS WARBLING) (CHILDREN YELLING) (LAUGHTER) ALBERTO: My house, my home is the Amazon. My heart, my mind are still back in Peru. (WHIRRING) (WOOD CREAKING) The government says we'll be consulted, but they keep making deals under the table to let the companies in. They continue auctioning off the Amazon. What I see... What I feel and what I perceive is... The great threat our world is facing and how badly we're contaminating it. We are killing each other. (THUNDER RUMBLING) (MOTOR REVVING) (LAUGHTER) The plants are so happy right now. They're quenching their thirst. ALBERTO: I feel that as long as I'm alive I have to do something. And that's why I've decided that I must go back. I know there are many threats to face. The government wants to imprison me to show their authority. Someone who fights for their rights is deemed a criminal. And that's why I must go back. Even if I'm jailed, I must go back. MALE FLIGHT ATTENDANT: Welcome to Lima, Peru. (PEOPLE CHANTING) MAN: Down with this repressive government! Down with oil companies in the Amazon! Long live our brother Pizango! CROWD: Pizango is a murderer! So you're here in the name of the officers that died in Bagua. But over there are people supporting Pizango. What's your reaction? I consider them third-class citizens, uncultured people. How can they support someone who incites violence? He's like a gang lord. He is a gang lord! How can they support a criminal who incites people to murder policemen? He's coming out. Testing, testing. He's coming out right now. There's an arrest warrant for Alberto Pizango for the crimes of sedition, kidnapping and conspiracy against the State. This is heavy police presence here at the airport. (CROWD CONTINUES CHANTING) (MAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ON WALKIE-TALKIE) Good afternoon. We have an arrest warrant for you. Please follow me. WOMAN: What's the charge? Come with me, please. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) You must go that way. (SIRENS WAILING) REPORTER: Any comments, Mr. Pizango? Make way! MALE REPORTER: Do you regret what you've done? Tell us the truth! Did you order the police to be killed? What do you have to say about the dead police? (REPORTERS CLAMORING) FEMALE REPORTER: Are you free? (CAMERA SHUTTERS CLICKING) (WHISTLE BLOWING) ♪ They say people from the jungle don't know how to fight! ♪ But now Alan Garcia will see what's coming to him, God damn it ♪ JOSE QUISPE: The charges are extreme. Alberto Pizango is charged as the instigator. He supposedly persuaded and convinced the demonstrators to kill. The accusations call for the maximum sentence, life in prison. This is what a repressive regime does. The government is using the penal code to deal with a thorn in their side. I demand that those who killed the police face justice. And also those who killed the natives. Don't let them hide behind politics. It's time for the legal process to take this natural course. It's time to punish those responsible. Or do they wear a crown that gives them the right kill? QUISPE: At no time, did the leaders coerce anyone into killing people. They should be acquitted. But there's a lot of political pressure to make an example out of Pizango and the others, to suppress future social protests. ARUWIHTU: You have been absent for too long because you defended the rights of your brothers. Now that you're back it makes me happy. -You're here with us. -Hmm. I am very worried about your situation. And I pray to God for you. (CRICKETS CHIRPING) (BIRDS WARBLING) (HORNS HONKING) Wait right here, please. MAN: Here we go. He's walking in. We're on in three seconds. FEMALE ANCHOR: On June 5th, 2009, over 30 people died during the tragic confrontation in Bagua. And Major Bazan was never found. His father continues the search and he's with us today. Welcome Mr. Bazan. Thank you for the opportunity. There were two photos that showed indigenous man taking my son away. So he's alive. What does that photo say to you? FELIPE BAZAN: That they've taken my son to a native community. As a father, I believe my son's still alive, because I haven't seen any evidence that he's dead. Many fathers have lost their sons. But they've been able to bury them. That's where they visit and pray for them. It's where they can pour out their pain. But my situation is completely different. I must keep searching until God helps me find my son. If I don't, my life wouldn't make any sense. How are you? Nice meeting you. (ALL CHATTING) BAZAN: I want to be completely sincere. What happened, happened. But people like me, a father, I'm still paying the consequences. You're a father, right? Yes. I would suggest that you don't let this continue as a public prosecution. We've got to create trust with our brothers. We have to assure them that there won't be any retaliation. BAZAN: I don't want to go with the police. I know it won't lead to anything. What happened was so awful, that people were left afraid. -All I want is some information, Mr. Alberto. -Hmm. BAZAN: That's all. I still think he's in one of their communities. People ask why? I don't know, but I still feel it's possible. But if he's found dead at least he'd be found. Even if I find one bone, I'd go home with peace of mind. Let me know if you need anything. WOMAN: To all those being charged, we need you to bring your ID up front. (CAMERA SHUTTERS CLICKING) (INDISTINCT MURMURS) (BELL RINGING) This trial concerns the events that began on April 9th, 2009. Many native groups protested and demanded that the government repeal a number of laws that, according to them, affected their interests. In this context police officers were murdered, there were injuries and damage to property. We will show that the accused instigated protesters to commit these crimes. The first criminal count is murder for the killing of policemen. We charge Alberto Pizango, Joel Simpucap, Diego Timillas, Santiago Manuin, as instigators of this crime. I was part of the investigative commission and this is what we learned... There are two ways up the hill. The police came up this way. They came so close that the indigenous people confronted them. Some of our people got hurt. One wounded, two wounded... But when the third person was wounded, people lost control. They started yelling. "They're killing us!" And then they took their guns. They grabbed your son. And they killed the other officers. Why, then, didn't they kill him? That's my question. MANACES: Because he was the one giving orders. The commander. They wanted to take him hostage. But once they got down to the road, there were too many people and they lost control. Lots of people joined in. And they had machetes. They took him to the river. And that's where they dismembered his body. He was dismembered. And they threw him into the river in pieces. (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) Did you promote the Amazonian protest? I'm the president of an organization that follows the mandate of its people. But under no circumstances do we ever promote violence. Did you instruct natives to block the roads? Not at all, sir. I was only following my duty to take me people's proposals to the government. Did you instruct the natives to resist or confront the police? To defend their position on the road? I did not instruct them to do so at any point. Did you instruct or incite the natives to harm or kill policemen? ALBERTO: No, sir. Furthermore, I wish to tell you that in my peoples' view, I come from the Kampu Piyawi people, we follow the principle of protecting all life. We cannot kill. In our philosophy, we cannot even kill an ant. Because even that ant has the right to live. Under that principle, as the president of AIDESEP, I never ordered any violent acts. BAZAN: Of the humble people, those that work for their country, 23 are dead. Why? Because of the government's thirst for power and ambition? Because they want to sell the riches of the Amazon to foreign countries? Private companies and the government want to get rich. And this is the cost. What's wrong with this world... When oil or a piece of gold is worth more than a human life? (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) MAN: This is the Peruvian territory. This is one of the few territories in the world that has been barely explored. This is only the beginning of what could be discovered. The tip of the iceberg. Many areas haven't been drilled yet, and even more land has yet to be licensed. PINTO: The laws are repealed, and yet projects continue to be developed. Even getting rid of the laws didn't stop projects in the Amazon, not at all. (WHIRRING) (WOOD CREAKING) (WOOD CREAKING) (CRASHING) (FIRE CRACKLING) (PEOPLE CHANTING IN DISTANCE) CROWD: Because of the companies we must fight! Because of the companies we must fight! (CHANTING CONTINUES) MAN: Alberto, welcome. (CROWD APPLAUDING) ALBERTO: The world is changing. The ambition to exploit every single natural resource, is blinding humanity. Our leader Alberto Pizango will speak. Let's welcome him. -(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) -CROWD: Alberto is with us! Present! ALBERTO: We, indigenous people, keep fighting to survive. We'll fight so that the rest of humanity will always have the rainforest. Our communities, our people... We are the protectors of the natural resources. This is our home. This is our land. Never again can a government come to our home and destroy our land. (CROWD CHEERING AND APPLAUDING) CROWD: The people united will never be defeated! (CHANTING CONTINUES)
