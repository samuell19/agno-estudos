THINK YOU WE ARE TURKS OR INFIDELS, OR THAT WE WOULD, AGAINST THE FORM OF LAW, PROCEED THUS RASHLY WITH THE VILLAIN'S DEATH... BUT THAT THE EXTREME PERIL OF THE CASE, THE PEACE OF ENGLAND AND OUR PERSON'S SAFETY, ENFORCED US TO THIS EXECUTION? - HE LOOKS AS IF HE MEANT THAT FOR YOU, PAPA. - HE DOES LOOK AT ME PRETTY SHARP, DOESN'T HE? - WOULD THAT I HAD SEEN THAT LOOK, BUT AT THE TIME, JOHN WILKES BOOTH WAS ONLY ONE OF A MULTITUDE LOOKING SHARPLY AT OUR PRESIDENT. MCCLELLAN HAD FINALLY PROVIDED THE LONG-AWAITED VICTORY. THE EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION WAS MADE PUBLIC, AND DEATH THREATS TO MR. LINCOLN INCREASED BY A HUNDREDFOLD. ONE SYNDICATE OF GEORGIA PLANTERS EVEN ISSUED A BOND WORTH $50,000 FOR MY FRIEND'S LIFE, AND I COULD NEVER KNOW WHO WOULD BE TEMPTED BY SUCH A VAST OFFER. - HELLO, SIR. - MORNING, BOYS. BLESS YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE, SON. GENTLEMEN. - ON YOUR FEET, IT'S THE PRESIDENT. - HALT AND IDENTIFY YOURSELF! - GOD BLESS YOU, BOYS.

[pounding on the door] WE NEVER FOUND THE MAN WHO LOOSED THOSE BOLTS, BUT WE DID UNCOVER A MOST HEINOUS PLAN: SEEKING TO KILL MR. LINCOLN BY INFECTING HIM WITH YELLOW FEVER. THEY GATHERED CLOTHING FROM VICTIMS OF THE DISEASE IN BERMUDA. OUR DETECTIVE WORK SAVED MR. LINCOLN, BUT I NEVER COULD BE AT EASE WHILE ABSENT FROM HIS SIDE. I AM ASKED TO BE MASTER OF CEREMONIES AT THE DEDICATION OF THE CEMETERY OF GETTYSBURG. IT IS A GREAT HONOR, OF COURSE, BUT AS I CANNOT LEAVE YOUR SIDE, I WILL TENDER MY REGRETS.

YOU KNOW, FOR YOU TO LEAVE THE CAPITOL, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE, AND I WOULD NOT PRESUME. - I WILL COME. - THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES! [applause] RESISTANCE TO THE WAR WAS GROWING. MR. LINCOLN NEEDED TO REINVIGORATE THE PEOPLE, TO EXPLAIN TO THEM, AND PERHAPS HIMSELF, WHY THIS ENDLESS PLAGUE OF WAR MUST CONTINUE. - FOUR SCORE AND SEVEN YEARS AGO, OUR FATHERS BROUGHT FORTH UPON THIS CONTINENT A NEW NATION, CONCEIVED IN LIBERTY, AND DEDICATED TO THE PROPOSITION THAT ALL MEN ARE CREATED EQUAL. NOW, WE ARE ENGAGED IN A GREAT CIVIL WAR, TESTING WHETHER THAT NATION, OR ANY NATION SO CONCEIVED AND SO DEDICATED, CAN LONG ENDURE. WE ARE MET ON A GREAT BATTLEFIELD OF THAT WAR. WE HAVE COME TO DEDICATE A PORTION OF THAT FIELD, AS A FINAL RESTING PLACE FOR THOSE WHO HERE GAVE THEIR LIVES THAT THAT NATION MIGHT LIVE. IT IS ALTOGETHER FITTING AND PROPER THAT WE SHOULD DO THIS, BUT IN A LARGER SENSE, WE CANNOT DEDICATE, WE CANNOT CONSECRATE, WE CAN NOT HALLOW THIS GROUND. THE BRAVE MEN, LIVING AND DEAD, WHO STRUGGLED HERE HAVE CONSECRATED IT FAR ABOVE OUR POOR POWER TO ADD OR DETRACT. THE WORLD WILL LITTLE NOTE, NOR LONG REMEMBER WHAT WE SAY HERE, BUT IT CAN NEVER FORGET WHAT THEY DID HERE. IT IS FOR US THE LIVING, RATHER, TO BE DEDICATED HERE TO THE UNFINISHED WORK WHICH THEY WHO FOUGHT HERE HAVE THUS FAR SO NOBLY ADVANCED. IT IS, RATHER, FOR US TO BE HERE DEDICATED TO THE GREAT TASK REMAINING BEFORE US. THAT FROM THESE HONORED DEAD, WE TAKE INCREASED DEVOTION TO THAT CAUSE FOR WHICH THEY HERE GAVE THE LAST FULL MEASURE OF DEVOTION, THAT WE HERE HIGHLY RESOLVE THAT THESE DEAD SHALL NOT HAVE DIED IN VAIN, THAT THIS NATION, UNDER GOD, SHALL HAVE A NEW BIRTH OF FREEDOM, AND THAT GOVERNMENT OF THE PEOPLE, BY THE PEOPLE, FOR THE PEOPLE, SHALL NOT PERISH FROM THE EARTH. [crowd murmuring] - IS THAT IT? - IT CAN'T BE. - IT'S FAR TOO SHORT. - AIN'T GOT NOTHING ELSE TO SAY? - [applauding] [cheers and applause] - "SILLY, FLAT, AND DISHWATERY UTTERANCES "OF A MAN WHO MUST BE POINTED OUT TO INTELLIGENT FOREIGNERS AS THE PRESIDENT." - WELL, I'VE NOT HAD MUCH TIME FOR FOREIGN POLICY. - YOU HAVE LOST YOUR OWN PEOPLE, SIR.
