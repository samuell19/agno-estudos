- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! - What're you... Listen, listen, is this about money, man, because I... Son of a bitch. Man, please. Please, please, please. Don't do this shit. Fuck. Please. Please, don't. Please. You don't... You don't have to do this. I got a little boy. Shit. Our Father which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Police are baffled by the level of brutality which they've seen committed by the murderer. This is officially the first serial killer in Louisville, Kentucky's history. The murderer is still at large. Residents are being asked to stay indoors. In other news, Innotech's stock has dropped 20 percent this quarter. All right. Now, we didn't exactly have the best month. In fact, Darryl, you were the worst. By a lot! Now, however, we are still pacing to meet this quarter's goal. I have to give a big shout out to Sarah Draven. Not only did she land a big account in Nebraska in January, also sharing the wealth. She racked up six sales assists to bring our team to plan in March. Sarah, this is for you. ♪ I'm your dad ♪ ♪ I'm your dad ♪ ♪ I'm your dad ♪ ♪ Oh, I'm your dad ♪ ♪ Oh, I'm your dad ♪ That's the meeting. Alton, sandwich. Great. I'm sorry, Mr. Vargas, may I call you back in just a moment? Oh, great. Okay, thank you. Yes, bye, bye. Yes, may I help you? I need you. In my office. Now! Have a seat. Now, I'm going to talk to you about your numbers. This will be the last time. I'm trending to hit target this month, Brad. I don't know what you're talking about. Oh, I actually have a few new... Uh-huh. No, no, no, no. Your fucking numbers. The digits, baby. Your son needs a daddy. What about your wife? You're a douchelord. Is that a herpes blister on your lip? No, I cut myself shaving. What I'm saying is that I would like to see more of you away from work. And... If you need some help financially... No big deal. I hear you're looking to buy a house. Yeah, no thanks. I think I would rather suck the fart out of my own ass. You know what, I really enjoyed this talk. It was totally great. We discovered a lot about each other. I don't have herpes! Ugh. Oh, God! Alton, Jesus, you know I have a weak stomach. Hola, chica. Como esta? How are you today, my Latin lover? Oh, did the Aurora sale go through? Ugh, they literally wasted all of my time. I mean, you'd think my love life would prepare me for this but... And how is your love life? Well, I suppose that there must be some sort of drawback to being a beautiful, slender little animal in the sack but I can't think of one. Seriously, I'm like a fucking marsupial but with much better eyebrows. Mmmmm, yeah? Yeah, I'd have to agree. Oh, honey, any man's going to be lucky to be with you. - Ah. - You just got to keep trying. I'm trying my motherfuckingist. And what about you, dear? You are one of the rarest of roses. Interested in anyone? Not unless you are ready to give up on muchachos and make an honest woman out of me. Yeah, no, no. I'm raising Shepherd and he is all the man that I need. Sarah! I need to see you in my office. Now. He is full of spit and vinegar today. And I should know. I totally hocked a loogie in his club. Oh my God. You are so filthy. Ms. Jackson if you're nasty. Ugh. Come on, Brad, I already told you. No, no, no, no, no, it's not about that. No, no, no. It's about that account you sold. Nebraska Artichoke? It's fraudulent. What? No, that was literally my biggest sale this year. It can't be. It brought our team to term. Look, look, I cannot have my pay docked right now. Okay, I really needed that. See, that's the thing is... Corporate has very strict rules when it comes to fraud, especially when it comes to inside fraud. Especially when employees cash in on it. Now... I could... let this... go away but... What're you saying? What? Oh, so you're saying that I'm... If I don't... Oh. I would never! Fine. You're fired. - Excuse me? - Oh yes, as in fired. As in security is coming to get your ass fired. And, oh, tell your little boy Alton too. Poof, he's gone! He has been struggling for months. He's been late every day and you, you gave him some Artichoke leads. After everything I've done for you, I-arta-choke you and throw you out myself but, whoop! Nope, sweet, here they are now! Are you fucking kidding me? Two security guards to escort one woman? I can let myself out, bitches! I have been with this company for 12 years... I'm going to have to call you back. Something is happening here. I have endured your sexual harassment. I have brought our team to term every month and I have never been late! You fucking milky licker! I don't have herpes! I'll miss you. But I saw up your skirt. Oh, milky licker? Oh! Hot. It smells very disrespectful in here. Don't you ever! Well, that could've been a lot worse. - Really, Alton? - Yeah, it's a gag, okay? And not for gagging. I mean, a gag gift. Don't be gross. Amy from HR, we were playing a prank on her because she hadn't gotten a cock in so long. Look, as soon as I get home, I will call corporate and I will fix this. I mean, he knows you're trying to buy a house, right? What kind of jerk fires someone in this kind of market? Yeah. Yeah, and if I lose my job I lose everything. Not your dignity. I heard you in there. All right, you gave him hell. Ugh. By the Castle of Grayskull and by, by the staff of Moses, I swear to you, I will fix this. And I promise, I did not give you a fraudulent account, baby bitch! I just need, I need a temporary job in the meantime and, yeah, it'll fix it. Know of anyone hiring? Actually, yes. Yes, I do. Do you have a weak stomach? Flee from sexual immorality. Every other sin a person commits is outside the body. You are so sweet. But this sexually immoral person sins against his own body. Now the works of the flesh are evident. Impurity. You are not your own. Shepherd, it's almost time for bed. I know, Mom. Look, I'm trying. Okay, Alton mentioned some temp thing I can do in the meantime. It's not that nude modeling, is it? Or worse, the Avon? No. Well, maybe it's worse than that even. Oh, lord, lord, Avon? Sarah. No. No, not that. God, what do you take me for? No. It's a crime scene cleanup specialist thing. You mean like car accident debris? Uh... Shepherd, five more minutes. No, no, it's worse, actually. It's more like homicide cleanup. Blood, guts, you know, brains. Sarah, honey, you know you have the weakest stomach ever and you're also the biggest sissy on the face of the earth. You remember that time your cousin Tracy snuck you to see Psycho when you were four? - How could I forget? - Well, you slept in our bed until you were 12! Twelve, right in the middle! That's why your brother Vinny's eight years younger than you. You basically ruined our sex life. Oh, your poor father. Don't get me started, Sarah, you can't handle it. I'm going to stick it out. Okay? At least until I can get back into Innotech. You know, you're right, okay? I have a weak stomach and I'm a huge baby whenever it comes to scary stuff. But, hey, that's life, am I right? No, you're not. Sarah, I want more grandchildren. - You need to date. - Well, all right. After the day I've had, I really do need to be taken out. Either on a date or by a sniper. Look, I need to put Shepard to bed, Mama. I'll keep you posted. On the dating? On the job. I love you so much. You know, this is my favorite time of day. - Mama? - Yeah? In our new house, are we going to have a yard? Mmmmm. Yes, honey. Yeah, we're going to have a big yard. Muah. Oh, please. Please, don't. Please. I'm going to be a mother. I'm going to have a baby. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for coming. We do still seem to be missing one. We were supposed to have four today, right? I don't know. Oh, okay. No sweat. Welcome to your first day as crime scene cleanup specialists. For the duration of the day, I'm going to have you guys watch a series of instructional videos, so Todd will be here to answer any questions you may have along the way. Now we do pride ourselves on our open door policy as well as our transparency and, of course, we welcome any feedback that you may have at any time. We're probably going to be seeing each other more than we see our own families, so I'm going to do what I can to insure that we enjoy ourselves on the job. Oh, you should have some extra shoe coverings - underneath your chairs. - Oh. I'm going to grab your bootie. Excuse me? Oh. No. Your shoe covering. - Your... - Oh. - I'm sorry. - My God. I'm awkward. Flashback. Uh... Bootie. Thank you. Well, I will forewarn you, some of what you'll see on the videos today is a little... - Crimson. - Good word. I like that, yes. Crimson is a very good word for what you will be seeing. Essentially our job is to visit the aftermath of a crime scene, which is usually a homicide or suicide, and we use industrial grade cleaners to clean it up. I'll also advise you to probably keep your eyes and ears peeled on the evening news because sometimes you'll get a heads up as to where we may be working the following day - and sometimes it's messy, very messy. - Is it... - Yes? - Is it sanitary? Uh, no, unfortunately. It actually gave me the AIDS. That was a bad joke, I'm sorry, that was awful. Yes, yes, it is very sanitary. Of course, we obviously wear the industrial grade hazmat suits, as well as gloves, goggles and if the situation calls for it, even gas masks. Do you ever get used to it after a while or... Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, and we have fun on the job just like any other. It's kind of like, you know how butchers become so callous they don't realize that they're actually cutting a raw... You know what, that's a terrible analogy. Next question. Do we have to dispose of... the bodies? Oh, God, no, that would... That would be disgusting. The coroner actually removes the bodies before we even get there but sometimes they do leave behind... pieces. Uh... This may be super obvious, but if we're dealing with a murder scene, how sure are we that they're gone? Oh, the coroner removes them usually before we... No, sorry. Uh, I meant, how sure are we that the killer is gone or apprehended? You know, I've never actually thought about that before. That's... That's kind of scary. Hey, sorry I'm late. I had trouble putting on whatever this thing is. I guess these are just unisex then? Alton, welcome, I'm Dorian. Nice to meet you. All right, well, everyone, orientation begins now. Off to your stations. Todd will answer any questions that you have and good luck. Looking forward to working with all of you. Mmmmm. I'll work alongside you anytime. Get up and come here for a minute. I want to talk to you guys, come on. Get up! Let's go. Guys, just line up over there. Come on, let's go. All right, guys, listen up. I want to be real clear when we say this, when Dorian isn't around, I'm the boss. You understand me? When Dorian is off the floor, do not make eye contact with me. This is a dangerous job. I can't have anyone fucking around because if one of you all does some dumb shit, you put everyone else at risk. Did you just fucking look at me? Yes, sir, no, sir. Is Dorian here right now? I don't think so. Then why the fuck are you looking at me? Okay. Want to welcome all you guys to the team. On this team we do not wear our name on the back of a jersey but we do wear it on a paycheck every Friday. What the fuck is that around your neck? It's a pagan necklace. - I'm a Wiccan. - You mean like a witch? Hedge witch, actually. I mean, it's more of a spiritual thing anyway. I mean, I'm fine... I'm gonna stop you right there. We got a lot of videos to watch today. You guys get comfortable, we're going to be here a while. Son of a... There really isn't a gentle way for me to tell you this, Mrs. Garrison, but... We can clean the... your son from the walls but... The.... We will have to remove the carpet. Oh. Uh... It's quite all right. I understand. I don't know if the coroner told you or not but it was suicide. Jeremy... Jeremy always did have great imagination. Yes, I can see that all over the wall. Oh, no! Oh, I am so sorry. No, I meant the drawings. Your son was an amazing artist. Boss, you in here? Yes, we're in here. So glad you could make it. I'm so surprised you're able to show up on the second day. I'm fine. I am so sorry. I should've called out a warning. Yeah. I'm okay. So, what've we got here? It was a shotgun suicide. And I'll be honest, shotgun kills are the worst. It's the skull and the brain matter. The shit gets everywhere and jobs like this, we have to be sure to get every last piece. Does this bother you at all? Oh. No, actually. No, it's not that bad. I have a boy, so... A little muck, I'm used to it. Thank you for doing this. I know it's not an easy job. Did you see the sign-in sheet out front? - Yes, yeah, sure did. - Good. Hey. Sign me in. Late, late. Mmmm. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You know what this reminds me of? - Highland Middle School? - Mm-hm... Yeah. You were always late and I always had to sign you in. Always be late to the party. Mm-hm. All right, ladies, it's Mr. Clean time. Woo! Let's do this! ♪ They will never believe When you say ♪ ♪ That you've seen The darkness in the matter ♪ ♪ Never wanted it this way ♪ ♪ But it's hard to undiscover ♪ ♪ I know it's a lie ♪ ♪ It's OK, it is ♪ ♪ Your eyes are Focused on the clock ♪ ♪ The pain will fade away ♪ ♪ Because it's a lie ♪ ♪ It's OK, it is ♪ ♪ Bad thoughts landed On the spot ♪ ♪ The pain will Never stay this way ♪ ♪ This way ♪ ♪ The pain will never Stay this way ♪ ♪ This way ♪ ♪ The pain will never stay ♪ Well that was... not as bad, somehow as I thought it was going to be today. I mean, not nearly. - Really? - Yeah. Think of it this way, it's better than working for Brad. I mean, seeing his face at the office every day, getting his sandwiches. Yeah, suppose so but... It's just emotionally though, you know? That lady today, her son committed suicide. You know I have a weak stomach. It's just tough. Yeah. It's tough but, you know, so is life, okay? And you're a big girl. So suck it up. The money is twice as good as at Innotech. Enough said. Yeah, I guess, I mean... I need to think about it, okay? Look, I wanted today to be my try, just see how it is, see how I fare. But I'm going to be honest, earlier I was thinking about crawling my way back to Innotech and just begging Brad to give me my job back. Oh. Oh, God. That is going to make me sick, okay? Enough of that kind of talk, all right? Look, he doesn't deserve an employee as good as you, or me for that matter, if we're speaking honestly, and I think we are. Just keep thinking about the white house on the hill, picket fence, you and your son by the pool, thirty year mortgage, all of that, the whole shebang, the nine yards, everything. Think about it, okay? Promise me? I'll think about it. I promise. You know that girl, Regina, the witch? Mm-hm. Well, she says she some kind of medium but... swear to God that bitch is a large. Woo! How was your first day at work? It was fine, baby, just fine. I actually didn't think I could do it but I think I'll manage. How was school? It was school. Yeah, I know. I remember school. But one day you're going to look back on it and you're really going to miss it. Especially when you have all the responsibilities in life. How is Mrs. Webster? It's all for you. Everything I do, it's all for you. Let's see... if we can get any leads on tomorrow. In a redeeming turn of events... This may determine my fate with the company. ...as editor and chief. And for our top story, another shocking series of murders jolts the city leaving police with more questions than answers. Last night, another grizzly homicide took place at the old paint factory in Portland. Police say that some of the bodies were so mangled that they are going to have to send them off to forensics to identify them by their dental records. We're doing our best. I have men working around the clock at every waking moment trying to get a lead on the suspect. We are doing everything in our ability to nail this individual. But he's cunning. There has not been a certain pattern to these murders which makes zeroing in on them... ...all the more difficult for us. Just be safe. Please don't be Dorian, please don't be Dorian. Hello. Sarah, hey, it's Dorian. Hi. Can you hold on just one second? Fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck! Sorry about that. Hello. Hey, uhm... I don't know if you caught the news or not but just as they were breaking the story, I got a call for a cleanup at the old paint factory in Portland. Yeah. Yeah, I'm watching it now. It's so awful. I can't believe this is still happening in Louisville. It's just such a tragedy. Yeah, I know, it's brutal. But, hey, tragedy keeps us in business, right? Uhm... Do you know where that is? The coroner's there now and forensics is going to be clearing out around ten A.M., so I was going to have the team meet around then. See you tomorrow? - You know it. - Good, good. Hey, uhm... thank you for sticking it out. I know it's not an easy job and it's not for the faint of heart. I don't know what's keeping you here but it's got to be something big, so, I just want you to know that I appreciate that. Thank you. Yeah. Of course. Well, see you tomorrow. All right. Bye, bye. It must be something big. Fuck! You know, I really like what Reagan's doing. - Morning in America. - You do? I might be able to forecast it kind of early, but I think Trump might be president one day. Yeah, it's looking that way. Damn, what's up? You cleanup crew? Yeah. How'd you guess? You don't look like a dumbass, douchebag cop. What is up? Goddamn. - Yo, I'm Daniel. - Sarah. Is this your first day? No, actually, I spent most of yesterday cleaning up intestines and... genitals. Totally, it comes with the territory. You know, most people, they don't come back for the second day. Yo, by the way, don't ever let Dorian know what doesn't bother you. I've been working this gig for about ten years and he still thinks I got a weak stomach. Hmm. I don't understand. Yeah, well, you know, if I got to take off to take a quick fucking smoke break, - I stage a panic attack. - A panic attack? That's right. After all these years, he still thinks I freak out from time to time from the sight of blood or brain matter. But the fact is, it gives me leverage on my schedule. So pro tip, don't ever let him know it doesn't bother you. Well, thank you for that and I look forward to working with you. Oh, yes. You know it. I'm not going in. No. No. Uh-uh. I'm not doing it. There is pure evil in here. Look, I'm leaving, I'm sorry. - Hey, hey, hey, hey. - I'm not going in. Oh, it's fine, it's fine. It's okay. You know, I had those same exact feelings when I started. It'll pass. You just got to learn to detach yourself from the situation. - It'll pass. - Don't touch me again, okay? Oh hey, look, I'm sorry, look. Hey, look, I would never force you to do anything you wouldn't want to do, but seriously. I don't mean to scare you, but if I were you, I'd get the fuck out of here and I'd take all those people inside with me. Okay, there is very dark energy coming from here. I hope I'm wrong. Yeah, well, you are wrong. This ain't my first fucking rodeo, yo. Promise me. Yeah, okay, all right, right, yeah. I promise you. Mm-hm. Fucking crazy-ass motherfucking bitch. Goddamn. This guy must've owed the mob a shit load of money! - This is the best part. - What? Yeah, get this, get this. When we found him, he's laid out, he's laid out, he looked fine, he looked like he was still alive, except one little detail. His dick is in his mouth and I'm not talking about no Ron Jeremy thing, where he's blowing himself, you know what I mean? This was mob violence, this was terrible. Serious violence. Oh, your ass. I shit you not, I shit you not. Tony Two Times, mob boss, he was so pissed off at this guy, I heard it down at the station, that that's why he cut the guy's dick off, shoved it in his mouth because he knows we're going to come along, we're going to find him, we're going to release the pictures, that's what we usually do. And that way the guy's embarrassed long after he's dead. Hmmm. We should get down to the Man Hole Club tonight, maybe. Oh, hi. Sorry to interrupt. I'm with crime scene cleanup. Do any of you know if Dorian is floating around nearby? Oh yeah, he's upstairs on the third floor. - Will be getting down here real soon. - Okay. Thanks. Hey, Sarah, you made it. You know it. Good. Well, uhm... It's a big mess in here but it should be a pretty painless job. It may take a few days. Did you get to meet the forensics guys? Oh yeah. Got to hear all their horror stories. Yeah, those guys have seen it all. Well, uhm... All right, guys, let's bring it in. Hello. Yikes. Let me guess, you don't eat meat. I don't. But a sandwich in here? Fucking vegans. Let me ask you this, if animals didn't want to get eaten, then why are they made out of food then? Okay, guys. If you didn't catch it on the news last night, you might not be familiar with the details of today's job and that's not a bad thing. It's usually none of our business anyway but full disclosure, there have been a lot of homicides in town. Mostly in abandoned warehouses kind of like this one. We've cleaned up a few ourselves. But I will inform you, especially the new hires, that I did speak with forensics and the detectives that were here earlier and it is safe. They chased off a couple homeless people that were hanging around but they did a deep dive scan of the area, didn't find any suspects, so we're safe. Do we have any questions? Anybody? No? Great, let's get to it. Hey. I didn't mean to scary everyone at orientation the other day but serious question, how sure are we that this place has been scrubbed of a psycho killer on the loose? I, they assure me that it's... I'll tell you what, I'll have Todd poke around just to be sure, okay? Okay. Hey, Todd, can I borrow you? Yo. Some of the new hires are a little scared - just because of the nature of what happened here. - Yeah. Would you do me a favor? Would you just go check around? - Just make sure everything's cool? - Serious? Man, we did this shit like a million fucking times, man. I know, I know, but it'll put their mind at ease. Please, take Daniel with you. Whatever you say, boss. Yo, Danic Attack, I need you, let's roll. Jeez, I almost forgot. Thursday night they got two for one happy hour at the Manhole Club. We'll stop off at JC Penny on the way. I'll get some tighty whities. Let's go, let's go, hurry up, I got to get the car. Hey. Did you all scrub the area? Nah, did you? Fuck that shit. Twenty thousand square feet? So what do you think about that new crop of freshmen? Huh? - Are you fucking serious? - Huh? A bunch of fucking losers, man. I seriously doubt any of them would last longer than a week, to be honest with you. I know, right? Already had one of them got... before she even stepped inside. - Fucking took off. Scared ass motherfucker. - Good fucking riddance. Get the fuck out. - Sarah chick though. - That's what's up. Shit. Hold up. I know you heard it that time, you had to have. All right, look dude, I didn't hear shit. All right, you are fucking... You are fucking freaking me out, man. My fucking anxiety is at an all-time high. I can't do this. - For real? - I'm serious. You're going to do this fucking shit right now, man? Oh, shit, shit. Look. I just peed a little. You mind if I step out? - Todd, do you mind? - Just fucking go, man. You all right, you all right? Just see Dorian when you get back. - Just go. - All right. I'll let him know. - I could have sworn I heard something. - I'll just be over here. I got him. I did it again. Cheers to me. So what was... What was the worst job you've ever had to do? Or do I even want to know? No, it's okay. Well, my worst job was my first one. It was a house fire. Thirteen year old girl and her sister. Fire started in the kitchen. They think that probably the youngest was trying to cook something. But instead of running outside, they went upstairs and they got in the bathtub. You... It's kind of clever if you think about it, you know? The way that kids think, you know? They... I guess they thought the water would keep the fire away. But... They were, they were boiled. And the oldest was holding her sister. Like trying, you know, like trying to protect her. I'll never forget that. Jesus. My son is my whole world. I cannot imagine what those parents went through to lose their children like that. All clear, boss. Checked the entire perimeter. - Thank you, man. - Oh. Daniel had to step out for a minute. So I told him to see you as soon as he gets back. Good luck dealing with that shit. That's a bridge I'm going to have to eventually burn. This is absolutely disgusting. The blood is like stuck in my nose. Pro tip. Don't puke in your suit. It get all down in the crack of your ass and then we'll have to clean your ass off. Yeah. Good tip. Does this like get any easier? Oh hell yeah, man. - Shit gets way easier. - Yeah? You just got to develop some tough skin. Like last week, found some fingers laying on the ground, - I picked them up and I smack my ass with them shits. - What? Tough skin, baby. That's disgusting. Could be worse. I'll tell you what, man. I know this shit ain't easy. Go head over there in the room with Sarah and Dorian. That's light work over there. No body parts or guts or nothing like that. Seriously? Yeah. Todd... thanks, man. I mean it. Get your goofy-looking ass out of here. You all right, Bob? - Yeah - You with me? You've been awfully quiet. Did you just fucking look at me? Hey. He just left. You're safe. For now. Are you alone? No. My crew... My crew is here. We're on a crime scene cleanup crew. The funny thing is that the girl that left today, the new hire, she wouldn't... she wouldn't step foot in this place. She said there was pure evil in this motherfucker. And she was right. Fuck, man, fuck! Fuck! What the fuck are we going to do? What's the fucking plan? Hey, Dorian! Bob said he cleared this fucking room over here, right? Yeah. Well he forgot some shit. Dumb motherfucker. Hey, these are still warm. What the fuck? Shit. Hey, Dorian. Can I speak to you for a second in private, please? Yeah. - verything okay? - o, it's not. Somebody locked the fucking door. Either the forensics guys or Daniel. I got two bag-fulls of shit I need to take out too, so, what do you want me to do? Just leave them at the door for now. All right. I can do that. Hmmm. What is that? Two things. It's the only way out. All right, okay. Two. Where is Daniel? I don't know, man, he never came back. You brought the tools in, right? Yeah, yeah, I got the tools, yeah. - Maybe he's locked outside. - Probably. - You brought all the tools in? - Yeah, man, yeah. I got, I'm sure of it, sure of it. Absolutely. Find Daniel. Please. I got you. I got you, don't worry. Alton, get the fuck over here. Oi! Daniel! So, what are the chances your friend is just like messing with us? Nah, he's really not the type. Although, I do find it hard to believe that he suffers from panic attacks. Panic attacks? Yeah, man, so, basically Daniel's been known to leave several jobs because he has these panic attacks. You, I'd believe that shit. But him, nah, man. He's been doing this shit too long. And, really, Dorian would let him leave if he needed to, so, I don't know why he does it anyway. You know, I'm a lot tougher than I look. I am. Sure thing, sweet cheeks. Tough guy. So what, Dorian is just like the best boss ever then? He'll just let anyone do anything they want? Not exactly but, yeah man, Dorian is good people. He takes his job very seriously but he gives us plenty of space. So if Daniel really, really needed to leave, he'd let him go, no problem. Problem is, is that Dorian will stay here all night to do the job by himself. See, you would never have to get over on him because he'd give you anything anyways. Remember that shit. Is he single? Crazy little bastard. He is though, actually. It's not what you think though. Yeah, his wife and son died in a car accident about seven years ago. Yeah, man, it's real fucked up. He was in the passenger seat. He survived. So he blames himself. Said that when he regained consciousness, that he had seen what had happened, that... Ah, never mind. What? Nah, I don't want to depress you. Well shit, man, now you got to tell me. You ain't going to start crying on my shoulder and shit, are you? Enough with the gay jokes. You can't break me. I've spent my entire life dealing with alpha dicks like you. Yeah, well, just don't go grabbing my alpha dick - and we're cool. - Just finish the story. He said that when we woke up and seen what had happened to his family, he knew he'd never be happy again. So now when he is, he feels guilty and he'd say, the most important things in life aren't things and he learned that shit the hard way. Yeah. Wow. - Well, you ruined my day. - I told you. I mean, wait. Did you hear that? I did. Come on, over here, this way. Please, no, no, no, no. What the fuck? Hey, Daniel, is that you? Todd. Yeah, man, fuck, fuck, fuck. I'm in here and there's a man in here with me, Todd! Let me try and fucking pry this door open, man! How the fuck did you get yourself in there? Daniel, who's the man in there with you? You okay? No, man, no, no, no. There's a motherfucker in here who's trying to fucking kill us, brother! Watch your fucking back! Get me the fuck out of here! That fucker in there with you is trying to kill you? I got Alton with me, brother. We're going to get you the fuck out of there, man. - Just hang in there! - No, man, no, no. The guy, the guy in here is being held hostage. The killer is fucking out there with you! He's out there with you, Todd! Alton, go warn the others. Get the sledgehammer, it's not safe here, man. - Todd! - Go! I'm scared. I know but if you don't go warn the others and the get the fucking sledgehammer, we might all be fucked, man. You got to go! I can't go by myself though. Earlier you told me you were stronger than you looked, right? You told me that shit. You got to go, man, go! Go warn the others, man, go! Get the fuck out of here! Go! Sarah? Dorian? Sarah, oh shit! - You were right, you were right, you were right! - What's wrong? Daniel is trapped in a room back there and Todd is trying to bust him out, okay? Whoever killed these people is still in here with us. We got to get out of here! Stop, stop, stop, stop. Calm down, calm down, I need you to calm down. Listen, look at me. Look at me, look at me. Where are Todd and Daniel exactly? They're down there, there's a room to the right. There's a red door. He wanted me to get the sledgehammer, okay? And to warn you guys. I mean, the killer is still walking around here with us. We need to stick together or we're going to end up like those people stuck in those bags! We move quickly. Keep your eyes peeled for any windows that don't have bars. Come on. Move! What's taking him so long? What's taking him so long? What's taking him so long? Todd, Todd, please, please, please. - Come back. - Fuck. - Come back, come back. - It's not a game. I can't fucking break it down, man. Watch out. No, no, no, no. It's too loud. It's too loud. Keep it, we might need it. How the fuck does only one entrance to this place work? It's an old building! Okay, I don't know. Just, there's got to be another way out. There just, there has to be. I'm so sorry. - No, it's my fault. - Dorian. I should've sent you home when you came to me earlier. What about the... the concrete saw? - We can use that. - No, no, again, it's too loud. It's going to draw too much attention to us. Look, we have to find Todd and Daniel. We stick together. Okay. Okay. Must be Todd's flashlight. You want me to go investigate or do you want to go, Alton? I'm not going to leave Sarah. It's okay. That's all right, it's okay, it's okay. It's all right. Okay. I'm going to go check it out. If it's safe, give a shout, give some kind of signal without drawing too much attention. If you hear anything different, you run. Just run. Don't. It's all right. It'll be all right. Okay? It's okay. Be careful. Todd? Oh. Fuck. No! Run! No! We can stay in here until we get a plan, okay? Yeah. Agreed. So, what're we going to do? I don't know. I don't know but... I'm going to push through, okay? For my son, for you, we're going to make it. - Hi, you've reached Sarah. - And Shepard. We're not home right now. So just leave a message. Sarah, baby, yes, it seems that that Nebraska Artichoke account wasn't so fraudulent after all. So, ha, I can have my best sales rep back in the office. Woo-hoo! I hope. Uh... So, anyways, come on back. See you soon. ♪ I'm going to find you ♪ ♪ I'm going to find you ♪ ♪ I'm going to find you ♪ ♪ I'm going to find you ♪ ♪ Where did you go ♪ ♪ I got to know ♪ We can't get out of here, Alton. We have to fight back. No, I can't do that, I'm so scared. I can't. Alton, you have to be strong. We have to be. Oh no. No, no, no, no, no. - What, what, what, what? - Fuck. The sign-in sheet, he's going to know how many people are in here. Oh shit. Then we have to get it. We have to get it right now. Wait, wait, wait, don't. No, don't go. We just need to wait and make sure it's safe, okay? Just wait. I'm so scared. It's okay. It's okay. No, it's not. What's wrong? It's my fault that you're here. I'm sorry! - I got us into this... - No! - Sarah. - No! No! No! Baby, no. No, it's not your fault. You didn't do anything wrong. This is no one's fault. This is him. Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. It worked for you before, no? Did you know that in the Bible God killed over two million innocent people. Satan? He only killed ten. And still you pray. So I am more like God here than Satan, no? I'll tell you what, sinner. I will leave. I'm going to let you pray for ten minutes. Going to give God a chance to come and save you and if He doesn't, well, I'm going to come back here and strangle you until your eyes pop out of your head. Is that fair? - Deal. - Good. Good. Do you remember my eighth birthday party? How could I forget? My mom handed out 31 invitations, everyone in class. You were the only one that showed up. I didn't know that. Really? - I'm so sorry. - No. It's fine, don't be. We had the whole roller rink to ourselves. - Yeah. - It was so much fun. Yeah, I remember. I thought you had a crush on me. I thought I was the only one that you invited. You know, a true romantic. You wish. You know, I remember thinking that day, I'll never leave that girl behind. I never will. - Sarah, run! - Alton! Alton! Why're you doing this? Please, man, please. Please, please, please, please don't do this. Quiet. You trying to prove a point? No. No, you are. You are proving to all these fine gentlemen that God has abandoned you. All of you. He left you this way. Today will be the worst day of your entire life. It will also be your last. And his also. And his too. Do you see that man over there? The one with no scalp? He had a story too. And a family. I'm going to keep my word. Do it. I don't know why you even keep me alive this long. I did it to see if God was going to come and save you. He never came. I am God here and I am here to deliver you from evil. So stand up. Stand up. Up! Up, up, up, up! - Oh! - You are not keeping your end of the deal. I will be honest. I just want to slice open your stomach and watch your guts spill to the floor. But you are a lucky man. You see that chair? I built that garotte chair and you are going to be the first person to sit in it. You see, I told you. You're a lucky man. Please, man, please. Please don't fucking do this. I'll do anything, just please don't. Please don't fucking do this. You will? I will admit anything. Just... Just don't fucking do this, man. Okay. I won't. You won't? No. I won't. But you will. You are going to kill him. - I can't kill a man. - Stand up. I can't kill a man, but I can't. I'm not going to fucking kill a man. Ugh. You told me you'd do anything if I don't kill this man, did you lie? No, man! I just fucking can't, man. I fucking can't. Okay. You're going to kill him. Hey, maybe God is real. No. I will be right with you. I must keep my word. Okay, you. Kill your friend. I fucking can't, man! You're going to die anyway. - I can't! - Don't you want to know what it's like to send a soul to heaven? Kill him. What I mean is, I can't do it with my bare hands, man. - I need a weapon. - Oh, you need a weapon. Fair enough. But the torture chair is for him. You pick. I want to make it quick for him. Todd, what the fuck are you saying, man? Ah, ah, ah, ah. Huh? Use the machete. If you hit him here and here, he will die instantly. If you hit him here, well then you'll just piss him off. If you want to end it quickly, hit him here. Hm? Yeah? No, no, no. No, no, please. Hey. Fuck! Sarah? Regina? Regina! God, thank God you're here! Regina, the door is locked and the man who killed those people is still here. He killed Dorian... and he's got Alton. And there's other people here too and... I need you to open the door. No, no, Sarah, no, I can't. The door is locked. There's chains all over the door! Shit, I need tools! Are there any still in the van? No. No, no, no, no. They're all, we brought them all inside, they're... - They're all in her with me. - Okay, okay. Let me see if I can pry these... Okay, Sarah? Sarah, I'm going to go back to the van and get some help, okay? Okay, stay right there. Don't move! Sarah! - Alton. - Sarah! Damn it! The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures, He leadeth me beside the still waters. He restoreth my soul. He leadeth me in the path of righteousness for His name's sake. Ah. Now that part wasn't so bad, was it? ...the valley of the shadow of death, - I will fear no evil. - You know, I've discovered that often times, the fear of death is scarier than death itself. Thy rod and thy staff they comfort me. Most people that I've killed seem... Thou preparest a table before me in the presence... - ...at peace. - ...of mine enemies. - Thou anointest my head... - But for this one, - it's going to hurt... - My cup runneth over. - ...Very badly. - Surely goodness and mercy... So I want you to just... relax. No, no. - Relax. - ...runneth over. Surely goodness and mercy will follow me all the days of my life. Oh, that was fantastic! I never expected, whoosh! Why are you doing this? Oh, why, why, why, why, why, why? Do I need a reason? I am the punishment of God. If you had not committed great sins, God would not have sent a punishment like me upon you. Okay, okay, look, please, please. Look, I can, I can make this right. I can clean all this up, okay? Let me ask you a question. Who is going to come and clean your body up? I remember when I was a little boy. I would say to myself, "Oh, that girl is very pretty. I'd love to see her insides." I just never thought anything of it. It was normal. Huh? It is like with you, right here, right now. I really just want to cut out your spine. Good job. I'm so glad you came. Keeps me from having to hunt you down, to try to find you. It's too much work. Now, can I ask you a favor? Can you stay here for just one second? Because if you don't, I'm going to punch your nose through the back of your head. Alton. - You piece of shit! - Oh, no, no, no, no, no. No, you cannot speak the queen's tongue in this profanity. Wait. Is he your... No. He cannot be. He's your husband? Well, it appears he is still alive. Eh, he's barely alive. You know, I've read about forensic pathologists describing when rigor mortis sets in. Often times on the autopsy table, dead bodies will rise to their elbows and almost sit up. I've always found that so... Wait. You are going to say something? After all of that? Oh, I simply must hear what you need to say at this very moment. I'll never leave you... I'll never leave you, Sarah. That was beautiful. That was so beautiful. He's lying. No! No! No! No! I did him a favor. I stopped him from seeing what was going to happen to you. In my opinion, you should be thanking me. Now let me ask you, is there anyone else running around in my mortuary? Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit! Shit, shit, shit. Fuck! Fuck! Hey, you! You, you, you! You, come, come, come over here! Come here! Come here, shit! Ugh. Now I'm going to have to hunt her down and try to find her. I told you before, it's too much work. Once you stop... I'm going to give you an honorable death, hm? Something of fancy, yeah? Is that how you exercise? I may incorporate that into my morning routine. Oh no! Oh, no, no! It's really quite clever. Oh. I got you, I got you, I got you! I got you! I'm going to have to hurt you back. This does not feel right at all. I can't even do anything fancy to him. But you, oh, your leg. You know, I never actually got anyone in the trap before. Congratulations. Oh. It is a wicked wound. I bet it hurts. I also have an injured leg. Your friend over there, he may have cut off my big toe. I haven't checked but I can feel one of my little piggies, it's rolling around in my boot. I just hope it's not one of the little piggies that were supposed to go to the market, you know? Hmmm? What is wrong with you? Who are you? I... am everyone. I can walk amongst people in a crowd and go unnoticed. I am no different than you. It is a shame that your actions don't dictate your appearance. Some people, they would call me a monster. But could you pick me out from a crowd? Bullshit! Why? Why? Why, why, why, why, why, why? Why? Somewhere someone is praying to have the things that you take for granted every day. Food, drink, work, love. Every animal in nature that eats meat, kills. Even you. I don't eat meat, I don't kill and I don't take anything for granted. Is that so? I do this because I like it. And like you, cleaning up crime scenes, sometimes you actually have to forget that they are real people. I have a son. I have a son, Shepard. Please, I don't want him to grow up without a mother. I don't want him to. Please don't. Please. Edgar Allen Poe. He grew up as an orphan. Your boy will be fine. Unless he meets me. No! No! Regina! - Regina! - People outside? Your face. It is so pretty. It is so beautiful. I'm going to miss it. Shit! Abashed the Devil stood and felt how awful goodness is. Sarah! I'm sorry I'm late. Oh my God! Oh my God, Sarah! Sarah, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God! Jesus Christ, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry. I should've told you. I should've told you, I should've, shit. Shit. Shit, shit, shit. Shit, oh God. - Hello? - Sarah. It's been two weeks! I'm worried sick. Yeah, I just need some time. Have you heard anything from the police? No. No, they haven't said anything. I can't get him out of my head. I see him everywhere. And that's what's so scary. I just need to get my mind off of him. I need to get back to my life. You're not going back to work, are you? Yeah, I think it'll be good for me. Brad called and apologized profusely and asked me to come back. So I'm going back tomorrow. Surprise! Oh, that Brad. What a sweet, sweet man. I would still hit that. Mom, no. Brad is being fired for years of sexual harassment. My only motivation for going in is to see it in person. What, hey! What? I just don't know if I can do it without Alton smiling every day... ...late. Sarah, I don't want you alone. I'm going to push through. For my son, for you, we're going to make it.
