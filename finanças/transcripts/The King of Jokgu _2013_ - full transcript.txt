Then what the hell were you doing in the army? What are you studying? Food Science & Technology studies in the Dept. of Food and Nutrition... Prepare for the civil service exam. Tread lightly and don't even think about dating a girl. Stop acting like a soldier. Move quietly between the classroom, library and dormitory. Study for the civil service exam. I'm not very interested in becoming a civil servant, sir. What's your TOEIC score? I haven't taken the test yet, sir. - What's your GPA? - My average is 2.1... Prepare for the civil service exam.

You haven't changed a bit. You've changed a lot. Yeah? I lost 44 lb. I only eat seaweed. Just seaweed? Yes, just seaweed. Nothing else? Yes, just seaweed. How can you do that? It's okay, I wanna get a girlfriend. Yeah, me too. By the way, did you know that the jokgu court's gone? I know. Why are you doing this in a public place? - I'm sorry. - I'm sorry. Keep doing this and you'll find your names on the bulletin board. Slackers... She's really cute. Huh? There's no vacancy for a part time job on campus, but there's one outsourced position. Do you want it? Sure! It's a facilities management job. Please visit the maintenance service. Okay, sir. - Do you know the jokgu court... - Jokgu court? I'd like to suggest that the school rebuilt the jokgu court but whom should I speak with? You want the jokgu court back? Yes, sir. Why? I want to play jokgu. Hmmm... Sounds like 'jerk-off', doesn't it? Why don't you propose the idea to the president? Are you serious? Talk with the president! They're afraid there might be no one. Support for a new Jokgu court! Thank you. Jerkoffs... Can't we just practice the listening parts of TOEFL or TOEIC? Is that Min Kang? OMG, he's freaking handsome. Let's go. Excuse me. Are you two in a serious relationship? No. Why? Ah, I see. Anna. Yes? Would you be my partner? I think we could make good partners for the short play. Okay. Here's my name card. The one and only name card like this in the world. She's really doing it with you? Yeap. The name card worked. Looks like she's got a boyfriend. Who? The guy next to her, Min Kang. He was once a member of the national soccer team, but couldn't make it to the big league due to his injury. Doesn't matter. There is a goalkeeper, doesn't mean you can't score. I should learn from your attitude. Freaking dirty. What? 3rd Talk with the President 3rd Talk with the President - Just a little bit... - Yes, sir. A bit more, more to the center... Stop, stop. Good. The president is entering. How do you do? This is your president, Hoon Kang. The campus is in a full bloom now with flowers sprouting all around. Wow, Spring has finally arrived! Spring. Just the thought of it makes my heart flutter. Here comes the Virgin Spring in her new garment of green grass... There were only ten or so people for the last talk, but many have come today for the extra credit... The aim of this event is to have the opportunity to talk with you. Sitting face to face with you and being open-minded, I'm open to your concerns Is that guy the president? Lol, that's cute. Is that guy the president? Lol, that's cute. suggestions and visions for the future. Let's discuss how we could cooperate to move on to the next level. Hello, this is Yim Youngwoo from the Dept. of Business Administration. First of all, thank you for being here to have an honest talk with us, Mr. Kim. His name is Hoon 'Kang'. Whatever. Here are the results of some research I've done. Youth unemployment has hits a million. It is fault of university. There's an internship program in major companies and... How about the rise in tuition fee? Have you ever had a part time job? Do you know what's happening in the EU right now? How do you spend all of our tuition fees? Oh, you don't know? Yeah, that's because you don't care. Since you're opposed to the policy... increased by 0.3% in comparison with last year. Have you been of any practical assistance to us? Are the expenses for the sake of the students? Why are you against the idea? That's all. Thanks for your opinions. As a senior and also as the president of the university, I deeply sympathize with your concerns. But who do you think I am, the President of Korea? Partnership with firms solving the youth unemployment problem... Yeah, I want to do all that. There are many companies out there looking for partnerships. Do you know why I opposed to the policy risking my position? If corporations become involved, they will take over cafeterias, stores, dormitories, everything! Tuition fee? I can't cut it down. The foundation decides. Student leaders fighting for lower tuitions: They're logrollers! Where are they now? They've become faculty members! Isn't it a dirty game? But who's to blame? You, sitting here and blaming others. You are to blame! Mr. President, Wake up, you're not supposed to... I appreciate all of your opinions. Yes. Go ahead. Nice to meet you. I was discharged upon completing my military service on February 24th and immediately returned to school. However, I've found that the place where my friends and I used to play with great passion and joy has disappeared. Our jokgu court. It has since become a tennis court. Therefore, I can now no longer play jokgu with my dear friends. I would like to take this chance to make a recommendation that you rebuild the jokgu court for us. - Idiot. - What the... Objection! As far as I know, the jokgu court was overused by the few students who returned from the army throughout the year. Furthermore, it drew complaints from other students as it interfered with their studies. If you rebuild the jokgu court, you'll face the same complaints again. Can we find another place for it then? We can't waste our budget on the few who play jokgu. Well, I don't think it costs that much. Raise your hand if you enjoy playing jokgu. Two... That's all? I used to play jokgu a lot myself but it doesn't seem so popular these days. No more? - Are you guys Manseob's friends? - Yes. Don't sponge off of him, pay for your own dinner. He said it's on him this time. I only eat seaweed. Do you like to play jokgu? No, my doctor says I need to lose weight. I see. Do you like to play jokgu? No, her doctor says she needs to lose weight. Oh. That's good anyway! Help yourself. Good. You must have spent all your wages, right? It's okay, she threw in some more for you guys. It was really good. Do you have any sisters or brothers? Me? I'm the only child. Why? I was just asking. I have two older brothers. Yeah, I know. What's your favorite food? My favorite food? Japchae. I am back. Steak for dinner? Oh, I've got a part time job near the campus. - You can come visit... - You. You're the one who asked for the jokgu court? Yes, sir. Is your father rich? No, sir. What makes you so... romantic, huh? Looks like youth will last forever, right? As soon as you finish school, youth will stab you in the back. Hello? Anna! No, my cell was turned off. Thanks for calling me. I can't believe it. Is it Anna from... Would that kind of girl date that kind of guy? Once you become a civil servant, you can date any girl like Anna. Switch off and study. Yes, sir. Lunch? I'd love to, Anna. Does your family run a buffet or something? I gave it a shot myself. So, have you thought about the movies? Yes, they're a little bit old but more exciting than recent movies. What are they? Back to the Future I, II and III. Crazy... Yeah, it's a crazy movie. Do you have this as a video file? I don't have video file but there's a video deck in the classroom. If you could go back to the past, what would you like to do? Me? Well, I want go to a Seoul National University. That's a little bit different from me. Is that so? Actually, I came from the future. Hey, let's go see the movie together. Okay. Let's go now. - Come on! - Wait, I haven't finished yet. Hurry! Is this fun? Yes... Don't you find it interesting? Out of the three, my favorite is the second... You know what? Someone asked the president to rebuild the jokgu court. Isn't that funny? Why did you do that? Excuse me? Do you have a girlfriend? Not yet... You wanna have one, don't you? Yes. And you wanna hold her hand? Yeah. Then quit playing jokgu. Why? Girls hate jokgu players in school. Don't you know that? Why do they hate jokgu? You know... When you say soccer players, they're all good looking and rich. But for the jokgu... It's kind of... dirty. They play in sleeveless shirts showing their armpit hair. Smells like shit when they come to class... and act like they're still soldiers, always fooling around. And what does it mean? Jokgu... Is it an abbreviation for 'jerk-off'? I'm sorry. Just don't do that unless you wanna remain single for your whole life. Do you know how much fun it is? It doesn't matter how fun it is. Girls don't like it. To hide what I really like just because others don't like it, is silly. By the way, I'm gathering signatures for... You'll find us always on the job The Marine Corps First to fight for right and freedom And to keep our honor clean Wait! This is the Reserve Marine Corps of the Dept. of Civil Engineering, sir. Excuse me, can I see your student ID please? Fuck... Ah? Another of these sons of bitches in a Mercedes huh? Just go away. Hey, Kangmin! You don't say hello to your senior? Look at you. Hey, the ex-national soccer player! Wanna get out? What's up? You know Kangmin, who got into school with his 'special' talent. He just ashed his cigarette on my combat boots and isn't saying a word in there. Get the hell out asshole! Fuck... Hey, hey! Soccer players have no respect for their seniors? You're not a soccer star anymore, are you? Can I help you to say hello? Fuck! Hey! Son of a...! Excuse me. If you wanna live happily ever after, just leave me alone. I've got nothing to lose. Hello, Kangmin. What time did you leave Anna last night? I don't remember exactly. Maybe... ten thirtyish? Did you bang her? Bitch. You shouldn't talk like that. If you really care about her. What? He's my best friend and I swear he didn't do it. Who the hell are you? Hey, what are you doing? What are you doing here? I was just helping them. What's wrong with you? You guys gonna get it on again? Why don't you get it on with me instead? The one who scores 10 points first is the winner. Just three points. If I lose the game, I'll break up with Anna like you want. Go ahead. What do you wanna bet? Take my car. One to zero! It's your serve. Two to zero! - Instep kick... - Three to zero! Manseob wins! Manseob! Wow, that was great. Awesome! How did you do that? Back to basics. What was the last one? You can do better. Can I? How are you? I'm sorry! Three to zero! Manseob wins! The 38th Athletics Competition Jokgu Team Application Should've kicked it on the outside edge... Good morning, sir. You were right. I should've kicked with my outside edge. Then, what was that inside kick? You saw it. It was seen. Won't you join our jokgu team? They're getting many entries for Jokgu games now. Manseob Hong. Yes, sir. Are you crazy? You got his Benz? Nope. You stupid jerk... But even if I had lost, I wouldn't have give her up. You need a coffee-flavoured milk carton from Seoul Milk Corporation. Delicious. You can get the feel of playing actual jokgu with this. It helps you improve concentration and gives you a wider perspective. Since you're using the same muscles in jokgu as this carton kicking, it also improves your muscle ability and reduces the risk of getting injured, so you can kick the ball with more strength in the real game. Sorry. Don't worry about it. Sorry. Well... I can get some more. Changho, do you have any cash? Can I have... five cartons of milk, please? Sold out. Are you just going to let this happen? It doesn't violate school regulations. The Students' Union is protesting against it as it disrupts the academic atmosphere. Can't you just leave them? What? They'll have to return to their routine lives anyway. - At least... - What about their employment rate? What if the executive director finds out? The executive director... But does he care if students are playing jokgu? You're right, that's your job to manage the school so that executives don't have to care about students! You! For this school! For the executives! Executives, executives, executives! Do you call your brother at home executive? What's wrong with jokgu? They're not kids! Let them play jokgu! - Hello. - It's me. Hello, Sangman. The university is in a crisis situation. Why? Is there a tuition fees protest? No, not that. They've started playing jokgu. - Jokgu? - Yeah. - Jok...: What about jokgu? - Pardon? Is there any problem? Well, it affects the atmosphere and... Hey, you quit golf! Yeah, but golf is... If you're to keep calling me for these reasons, pay for your own bill. How dare you call me and talk about such an useless... Loarding house Three to zero! Manseob wins! Manseob! Fuck! I'll pay you tomorrow. - Come on, it's not a lot of money! - It's me. Open the door. Why don't you come to class? And why do you still have that car? Hey. There's no difference. Soccer, this dormitory, the Benz and us. Embarrassed? So what? Look at Manseob. He's kinda stupid but he has his own life. Then go out with him! Idiot. Waste your whole life there alone! A young man's smile changes the world to green. Standing on his two balls in his loose pants, he throws off his clothes in a public bath with a general's dignity. Moon, the goddess of night shedding tears, peony buds shooting up through the ground under a boiling August sun. Dahlia laughs out through its body. Behold! Himalayan peaks are underfoot. A young body will suffice to buy the whole world. Under the wide leaves of the sycamore, their dreams cover up the sky. Young man, your body is worth more than gold. You can conquer the world with your dream, kick the ball of sadness away. You can steal a kiss from her for only ten dollar. Lalala, you can whistle with you finger. You just have listened to 'Youth', a poem by Byungran Moon. Today is May 12th, 2013 The Morning Chung-Ang University. Good morning, this is your host Edward Jangwon Lee from CBN. Dear students, have you played 'jokgu' before? The athletics competition is only a week away! Especially, Jokgu fever is already all around us. Where the hell are you passing the ball? I can do better than that. The preliminaries are only a week away. Mirae, Just touch the ball with your foot, you don't need to kick hard. That's enough when you play jokgu. You get the ball from me, then just deliver it to Changho. That's all. Hey! Are you doing this on purpose? Sorry, I have to go. I have to do an assignment. - Hello? - Hi, Mr. Hong. This is Kim from Gwanghwamun Bank. Please make an extra payment for your student loan as soon as possible. Oh, yes, ma'am. To be honest, I couldn't handle my overdue account while I was in the military service. Can you give me some more time please? - I'm working... - I: understand your situation but the registration for this semester is due by the end of this week. I am sorry... Is there any options available? Well... In case of revocation of registration due to unpaid tuition, I can't help you. I understand, sir. Take care. - Manseob! - Yes? I'll find someone else to manage the vending machine. You don't have to. I'll finish what I started, sir. I can take care of it. Thank you. Here. No, madam. That's okay. Take it. Just a little gift for you. Thank you very much, madam. Do you have girl friend? There's a girl I like. - Wow! - Oh, madam, - You've got everything you need. - Uh... Let's have dinner together sometime. Really? It's so kind of you. - I'll be back in time for opening. - Have a nice day, madam! Anna If you don't have anything to say, I'll get going. Let's play jokgu again. I have an appointment right now. Sorry. Hey... Come on. Let's play... jokgu. I'm participating in the tournament next week. See you then. Come on. Anna would also... like to see you play with a ball again. See you there. Marty, you're acting like you haven't seen me in a week. And then, I haven't. Are you okay? Is everything all right? Then you answer. Everything is great. And then... Kiss? Do they kiss in the original movie? Hmmm... Who are you rooting for? What? Me or Kangmin? He came to me today. What for? He said he wants a rematch. So you guys did? No. I said he could play with me during the competition if he wants. Good. I want you to win. Beat his dick with your ball. Do you want something to drink? It's on me. What am I doing in the future? What's my job? Am I married? We have a beautiful daughter and... Fuck! Excuse me. It's okay. Shit... Let's play rock-paper-scissors. - Now? - Yeah, come on. Rock-paper-scissors! One more time, rock-paper-scissors! Again, rock-paper-scissors! Rock-paper-scissors! I'm a fucking bad girl so don't you ever fall in love with me. The Marine Corps Look, sir. Let me in. Sir. Dressed like that? Preliminary Rounds We're now in the parking lot where you can feel the jokgu fever! The former national soccer player Kangmin is playing for the Civil Engineering team. Isn't this amazing? A former soccer player is playing jokgu... That's right. Embarrassing if wins, Even more embarrassing if he loses. I don't understand why he's doing this. Time for the first preliminary match! Civil Engineering vs. Fashion Design. The game kicks off. Kangmin is returning a serve. Son of a... Wow! That's Kangmin for you! He's in a different league. The Civil Engineering team easily makes it to the quarterfinals. I don't think we can win this game... What are you talking about? Manseob even defeated Kangmin. They're no match for him. Another fascinating match up. Food & Nutrition vs. Mechanical Engineering. Hong, famous for his video plays on the Food & Nutrition team. I've seen it out, too. Kangmin was humiliated. Food & Nutrition is emerging as a dark horse in the competition. The rest of its members, save for Hong are quite unfamiliar. I think we have a very tasty battle here. - What's that? - For my face. Go for it, Manseob Hong! Viva Food & Nutrition! Hong leads his team to a win wearing two hats. Fantastic. - Who's that big player? - You mean Mirae Lee? I wonder what she's doing there. Anyway, Food & Nutrition moves on to the quarterfinals. They play against the one of previous champions. Chinese Language! Great, Manseob Hong! Hong seems to have gotten hurt from the Chinese Language team's strong attack. What a pitiful situation! - Go, Manseob! - There's Anna! The queen of beauty! She's sensually cheering on the players. Anna Suh. I also like her very much. The game continues. I'm fine. It's fantastic Kangmin! Civil Engineering advances to the final first, by defeating the Dept. of Philosophy. I need to go to the bathroom. In! Now Food & Nutrition needs the last point to the final match. The Math team, the defending champion might have looked down on them. The Math team needs to change the situation. Time for strategies. Math team attacks Mirae. It was a very calculated move though it doesn't seem very fair. I feel for her. Are you alright? I'm okay. Sorry... It hurts when you're hit by a ball. Shaky Food & Nutrition, Can they overcome this crisis? They need another strategy beyond the Dept. of Math's calculation. Changho... - Changho! - Okay! That is...! No way... That is... Double... Double hit! Hong, Park, Hong, Park, Hong, Park! Hong! Hong attacks with his kick! Hong and Park in Food & Nutrition made a superb double hit! It was like a beautiful watercolor painting. The Dept. of Food & Nutrition goes to the final! It was a great game. The Food & Nutrition team shows great performance against an outstanding teams. Finally face Kangmin's Civil Engineering team in tomorrow's final. It's the first time for Food & Nutrition to advance to the final, right? That's not true. They were there three years ago. Did we really win? Wow, we've won! Gowoon! Hyunggook! You really ought to know better! What does jokgu mean to you? Manseob Hong, Yes? What does jokgu mean to you? It's fun. Stop eating! Save some for others. I prefer my steak medium-rare, so it's not too crispy and the juice... You do nothing on the court but all you do is eat, eat, eat... What the hell's going on here? Come on, drink up. Thank you. How long have you been together? No, we're not a couple. I'm a college model. We're not in a relationship, madam. It's just me that likes her. Really? No, I mean... I'm not saying that I don't like him. We're just not a couple. Remember, pride will set you up for a fall. Guys chase after you, right? Those who come for your looks, will quickly say bye-bye to your old face. You'll see. You'll be doing better later. Thank you. But I think you need to lose a little weight. Stand up. Do you see your feet? You can't, huh? Manseob, are you able to kick the ball when you can't see your feet? Have a sit. You have a great forehead. The ball would follow your head in the air. That's right, you can use your head! How about me, madam? Stop eating seaweed and try some meat. Enjoy this time of your life, you're young. Live your life, have no fear. After all work and no play, you'll grow old and die... God will be standing over you guys! How can you have a sex there? Madam... Oh, babies. Come on, it's nothing new. - Anna. - Huh? Could you do something for me? I don't want. Who will Anna root for tomorrow? I don't care. It doesn't matter if we win. I wanna win. Me, too. Have you had plastic surgery? Nope. I was Miss Chungbuk in 1987. So what? I'm just saying that... He's such a good boy. Manseob... Don't wanna keep it but don't wanna throw it away either. Do what you wanna do. But don't have any regrets. - Mirae, are you okay? - I'm fine. Incredible. He can't drink... Yeah, he doesn't enjoy drinking. Oh... Darling, where are you? - Mom, - Huh? I can't come home tonight. - Be careful not to hurt him. - Okay. - Make sure he gets home. - Okay. - His mom must be worried, too. - Okay. - Hey, Manseob. - Huh? See you tomorrow. Okay. Are they... It's Spring, you know. Hey. Huh? You wanna play rock-paper-scissors? No, thanks. I'd rather not. You were right. It's really fun. Jokgu, I mean. Thanks. Hey. Yes? I'm going to... cheer for Kangmin's side. I know. But we're still partners in class, right? Course. Take care. Bye. Kangmin uses his right foot only. Did you know that? I beg your pardon, sir. You stupid jerk... Hyunggook Lim! Thank you, sir. Good luck with your exam tomorrow. I'll do my best, too! Thank you, sir! Mr.Wane! Bane! Ok... That's enough! That's enough. That's enough. Ok. next team is... Anna Suh and... who is your partner? My partner is Manseob Hong. I can't find your name. Did you drop this class? No. I... I couldn't register. But uh... I practiced a lot for this play. Would you give me a chance? No. Please... Ok... go on. Marty, you're acting like you haven't seen me in a week. No. I haven't. Are you okay? Is everything all right? You will not believe me but, I came from 50 years later in the future... 2063. I was in the hospital. I was just about to die from rectal cancer. I was in big pain. I wanted to die. At that moment an angel came to me. She said 'Your life was the most boring life in the universe so you wouldn't have fun even in heaven'. She said she send me back to the 2013. When I was 24. Shit, I had to go to the army once again. But I was so happy to go back to my twenties. Because when I was 24, I didn't even have time to date, I just prepared for the recruitment of civil servants every day and night. I had so many things to do if I could go back to 2013. I wanted to play jokgu everyday. What else am I going to do? Just then, something crossed my mind. There was a girl. The most beautiful girl I've ever seen. She like an angel. But I was so chicken. I didn't say anything, I just looking at her from a distance. I was so stupid. But I had a another chance now. I won't be a jerk this time. I love you. I love you from the bottom of my heart. Thank you. Final Rounds Time for the highlight of the competition, the jokgu final! Food & Nutrition vs. Civil Engineering! Manseob Hong vs. Kangmin! Civil Engineering advanced to the final with a record low for points lost. Kangmin plays his role but isn't much of a team player. Food & Nutrition on the other hand, tends to lean heavily on Hong. Though their team plays well it might be too much for him. Yes. He's gonna reach his limit soon. Alright. The game is just about to start. Alright everyone. Now's the time. One to zero! - Give me the ball! - Okay! - Go, Food and Nutrition! - Hong scores. He caught the point! What happened to him last night? Kangmin needs some new strategies. The Civil Service Examination Written Test Another successful attack from Kangmin! He's reading their strategies. Where has Food & Nutrition's energy gone? It's known that Kangmin doesn't use his left foot. Are you okay? Sure. Civil Engineering team scores again. Taechul Jin's attack finishes the first set. Food & Nutrition... What will they do? Are you alright? Mirae, I know... but the ball's too fast. Manseob, You just pass the ball to me. Don't attack yourself. You need to save your energy for the third set. Let's end this game, sir. Hong can't block us now. Yeah, it's a piece of cake for you. Two of three attacks are enough to break his leg. Let's get it over with and eat some meat. Court change, Set 2! Manseob! You okay? Time out! Time out! Can he keep playing with his injured leg? Will he be able to block Kangmin's serve? I can go on. My foot'll be okay after a week. If I stop here, I'll regret it for the rest of my life. Let me give it a try Kangmin's one more successful serve will seal the victory. Everyone's holding their breath. Changho Park! Changho Park scores! He was the unsung hero! Look at him! Who's gonna be the winner? It's getting harder to predict. They're raining on Kangmin's parade. We get the chance now. I'll receive his serve by all means. Return it to me. You okay? I'm alright. One more point needed for Civil Engineering to win. Food & Nutrition needs to stop them. They have no choice! One last point. This is the moment. - Changho, return it to me! - Okay! You have a great forehead. Oh, it looks quite serious! - Is there a substitute for Changho Park? - Changho... Can you go on? Fuck! Are you blind? I got a concussion... Changho! Change players, please. Change players. We're giving up now. You'll be eliminated automatically. Is that okay? What's happening now? Is the Food & Nutrition team withdrawing? Ah, don't do it! The Dept. of Food and Nutrition has withdrawn. The winner is... Wait! Substitution! Who's that? Oh... That's Hyunggook Lim! The hero who led Food & Nutrition to the finals three years ago. Food & Nutrition Substitution! - Who is he? - Hyunggook Lim! He has been delaying his graduation for 3 years. Yeah, he's been studying for the civil service exam... Hyunggook Lim! Will he be the savior of the Dept. of Food and Nutrition? You're doing better than I expected. Who's turn is it to serve? Kangmin's. Okay, we're taking the second set no matter what. Ok. Let's go Mirae, too. Go, Food and Nutrition! Manseob, pass it to the front! The Civil Engineering has caught by Hyunggook Lim's trick! Ta da! - The set score becomes 1:1 now. - Yeah, 1:1! Thank you, sir. How did your exam go...? - Mirae. - Yeah. You'll be the target in the next set again. Our victory depends on your forehead. - What's your favorite food? - Japchae. I'll treat you 5 dishes of Japchae. Hey. Actually I wasn't drunk last night. - How's your leg? - It's completely fine. - Let me see. - No, I'm really ok... Geez... Let's get this over. Food and Nutrition, go! I won't give up. Me either. I should quit smoking. By the way, why are we doing this? Girls maybe? Go, Food and Nutrition! One, two, urgh! Go! It's a 9:9 tie situation! One last point. If I could go back to my youth, I'd make love with roses on hair, bells on bosom, making a jingling sound. I'll run on the wide open field full of green grass as if flying. You'd hear the sound of trembling bells in the wind, rising higher and higher echoing through the village, through the mountain, and to the sky. With my face getting red, jingle jingle jingle, jingle jingle jingle. If I could go back to my youth, With roses on hair, bells on bosom, I'd make love. I'd make love. Support for a new Jokgu court!

Good morning, this is your host Edward Jangwon Lee from CBN. Spring has passed and Summer's right around the corner. I think this will be a great summer anthem for you. PEPPERTONES sings, 'Youths'.
