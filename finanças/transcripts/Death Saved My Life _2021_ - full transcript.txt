Hello? Oh my god. 9-1-1, what's your emergency? It's my wife. She's gone and everything's... Oh my god. Sir? Sir, can you explain to me what's happening? I don't know what's happened. There's blood everywhere. And she's not here. I'm sending them out right away. - She's not here. My wife's not here. Okay well, can you give that one to mommy? - Thank you. You're welcome. - You wanna taste it? Just a little bit? - No. - Okay, okay, okay. Cereal it is. - Come here. There we go. - You have surgery today? - Yeah, just one with my new interns. Did you have any luck with the sitter? - No. My sister said that she'll do it, so I figured I'd bring her back here after we go shopping. Aunt Leigh? - Yes, auntie Leigh. And she can't wait to see you. - Kayla, I will see you after school, okay? - Okay. - See you. - Have a good day. - You too. There it is. The privilege of every heart surgeon, to be able to hold the lives of our patients in our very hands, to have the opportunity to be either a savior or a failure. That's why this opportunity should not be taken lightly. And why mistakes are never an option. Understood? Good. Let's save a life. Maybe he has a 1 o'clock appointment available for me? - All right. - Good morning. - Hey. - You're here early. - Did you get the revised designs? - I actually was getting ready to look at them right now. - Remember this? Client just called. Said it's been the most successful product launch in their company's history. Another reason why your award tonight is so well-deserved. - Aw. I love it. We can pop it open during lunch today and everyone could have a drink. - Oh no, that's yours. This is all your genius. But, I'll see you tonight then. Maybe we'll raise a glass then? - Of course. I feel better already. Thank you, doctor. - You're welcome. I'm gonna give you your temperature. - What it say? - 100. 100? Well, that's more like you. - Well, I have a waitressing interview. Yes. And I have another one at that hotel on fifth? As a front desk clerk. Don't make a big deal. - But see, that's a good thing why we run out and got you these clothes. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Do I need more medicine? - Wait a minute, what is going on in here? Hi! - Aunt Leigh! - Hi! Hi baby girl! - Hi! - Hey! Hey. - So what's going on? - We're giving daddy a check-up. - I got an idea. How 'bout you pack all of this up for my place so these two can get ready for mommy's big night? Yeah? Yeah, let's do it! Ed, you have to see this dress she just got. It is smoking. Come on, come on, come on. She's so modest. Smoking, right? - Wow. - Yeah. I thought it was you doing the shopping. - See, that's exactly what I said. - Well, you had to wear a hand-me-down to your graduation. And look, I know you dreamed of wearing a dress like this for your valedictorian speech, so you owed it to your 18 year old self to buy it. Don't be so hard on yourself. But trust me, once you see her in it, you will thank me. - Jade, I didn't know you were valedictorian. Of course she was. Come on, little one. - Wait. There we go. Goodbye doctor. - Have fun with your tt. - Thank you. - Love you. I'll see you later, ed. - See you. - See you later, sis. - Wait, wait, wait! - Yeah? - Yeah. - Guess I'd better go get ready. - Too bad. - I'll just um... I'll wear my anniversary dress. - Good. This would've made you look like a whore. - Where is your hard earned award going? The mantle? The office? The bedroom? - I don't know yet. - Well, you gotta show it off because what can I say, this one is brilliant. Always two steps ahead of everyone else. - Thank you. It's not like I'm saving lives. - That reminds me, my doc says I may have a little murmur. Any chance I could get a second opinion from the best heart guy in town? - Rob. Leave the man alone. - I'd be happy to. - Then here, a toast to my heart and to Jade. Preception's most creative and outstanding leader of the year. - Sorry. Never touched the stuff. Come on, it's the after party. Gotta keep the hand steady. - Well, not me. In fact, I'm gonna see about getting another bottle so we can all toast. - What an ass. I don't know how you can stand to work for him. You and I have a special day coming up. - That's right. 10 years. - Would you like to celebrate it like last year, at chateau briond at alouette? - Well, it's your favorite, so of course. - Before we crack this one, Jade, a few words? - No. I already gave my long-winded speech at the ceremony. - We want more! - We want more! - Okay, all right, all right, all right! Well first, my team has to come up here with me. Wow. This award may have my name on it, but everybody knows that marketing is a collaborative effort, so if I could put your names on it or if could split it into three, I would because I can't do what I do without you guys. - Well said. - To Jade, yes? To Jade! - You're the best. - Thank you. Thank you. Oh, exactly. Absolutely. Thanks guys. - Okay, love you too. It looks like Leigh and Kay had a good time. - Hey look, in the future, I want someone else to look after Kayla. - But ed, she's good. - Jade, don't be naive. Your sister's been back in your life for a few months and bipolar's hard to manage, even with meds, all right? - Yeah, okay. - You seem to give that Liam, quite a lot of credit tonight. - Oh, he's just part of the team. I gave them both credit. - Then why couldn't he wait to get his hands on you? And you just let him. Jade, it was humiliating. - It's just work colleague, you know? Liam, Jen. - You think he's better than me, don't you? - No! - Just tell me the truth. You think I'm stupid? - No! - You thought I don't know why you begged me to go back to work! - I just needed to work. It helps me. - Here we go. That's right, poor, depressed Jade. You don't seem to remember that I'm the one who was there looking after you when you had nothing! No one! - I'm sorry, ed. - You're sorry? What are you sorry for, huh? - What are you doing? - I'm sorry. - No, no, no! - Tell me! - What did you do? What do you do? What do you do? Just tell me what you did! Tell me! - Please, please! - What did you do? - You thankless bitch! Without me, you'd be dead. I saved you, Jade. Never forget that. I saved you.

You broke up our family and I'm worried about you. - We're fine. - You're not fine, Jade. Depression doesn't go away. I remember how low you were after your parent's accident.

Nice, nice! Good job. - Well, I'm not telling Wendy you're on the market 'cause she'd leave me in a red hot minute. - Come on. Settle down. You run this town. - True, but you saved her with that triple bypass, so I think you got one up on me, you know? - Go Kayla! Good job, good job! Good try! - That was an incredible pitch you just nailed. I mean, we haven't been able to land that client in years and then boom, you just do it. - I think I just had a good read on them. Nah. You always know what the client wants, even before they do. It's amazing, really. - Thank you, Liam. All right, I should probably get going. I'm already late. But I will see you tomorrow. - That you will. Goodnight Jade. - Goodnight. Hey Leigh. I'm sorry. My meeting ran over. Yeah, but I'm on my way now. Thank you. Ed, what are you doing here? - Here go your papers. - Yeah, we'll they're pretty straightforward. I don't want anything, so. - And you think i'm gonna sign them so what, you can screw that leech Liam with a clear conscience? - Let go. Let go or I'll file a restraining order and how would that look? - Go ahead and try, Jade. No one's gonna believe you. I save lives, remember.

All right, I think that that is the last of the gifts. - Yeah. - Mommy, when is daddy coming? - Well, you and your daddy get to celebrate your birthday again this weekend together. - Okay. - All right, now why don't you take this upstairs and you can play with that. And me and auntie Leigh are gonna clean up. - Yes. - And put your pajamas on. Okay. - So, what does ed think about your new place? - He actually hasn't said anything yet. - Well, did he sign the papers? - My lawyer got them back today. - Wow.

My oldest plays in the same league. - Well, it's a good league. - I should go talk to the coach. - Yeah. - I'll see you. - Girlfriend? - We've been out a few times. Shawn introduced us. She's great. Hey, have a come by the house and pick up your stuff. - Oh no. I'm good. - Well, look, unfortunately, I'm gonna be away for a conference for a few days, so I won't be able to take Kayla for my weekend. - It's okay. - Can I come and grab her for a few hours on the way back? Take care. - You too. - Hmm. See you guys next week. Bye. - Jade! Hey! Hey. I'm glad I caught you. I wanted to ask you earlier, but you were so busy. Did you want to maybe get together this weekend? - Grab a drink or some food? - What? - No! - Oh. Okay. See you in the office on Monday. - Leigh! Leigh! Kayla! - Jade. - Where is she? - Jade, what are you talking about? Hello, Jade? Jade, are you there? Jade, is Kayla okay? - She's fine. - Look, Jade, I don't know what's going on, but I've just arrived in Phoenix. I've gotta go. - Jade, hey. Hey. - What are you doing here? - I was gonna check in on something. - Oh, well can I help? I am the boss. - Right. - By the way, I was really sorry to hear about you and ed. Wendy and I, the four of us never really hung out, but I know ed so. So who knows, maybe you can find a way to work it out. He's good people. - You know I was gonna ask about something with the school zoning matter. It's fine, I can just have the board follow up. Are you sure? I can help. - Yeah, thank you. No, no, no, it's good, it's good. - Okay, see you later. - See ya. - Bye. - Why didn't you say anything? - I didn't tell anybody. I should have saw it. I should've saw it. - No, nobody saw it, nobody. Everyone thinks ed walks on water but he was good to me. He was there for me when mom and dad died and then one day, we were at a friend's house and I corrected him on something, I can't even remember what. And when we got home that was the first time. And I rationalized it. You know, I rationalized it to his mother always cutting him down but after that it was like everything I did. - Jade. I'm so sorry. And I swear I will never let him hurt you again. - I don't think you can. I think he's trying to kill me. - What? Jade, no, if that's the case, you have no choice but to go to the police. - His best friend is the police sergeant. And I know ed. He'll turn it around. He'll make me seem like I'm the crazy one. She's the one who had the nervous breakdown, another one he had to save. The only way anyone would believe it is if it came from his own mouth. - Then what are you gonna do? - I don't know. The only way anyone would believe it is if it came out of his own mouth. What are you gonna do? What are you gonna do? - So I packed you both lunches to eat at the park. - Can we get ice cream? - Yeah, of course, sweetie. - Jade, I don't think you should be alone. I think you should go with us to the park and we can figure out a plan for you to get out of here. We can do it- - Kay baby, why don't you go get your jacket to go to the park? That is beautiful sweetie. - Thank you. - I don't want you to worry, okay. But if something does happen, I need to know that you're gonna look after Kay. - Jade, I am not okay with that. - Please, will you just promise me? Trust me. - All right. - All right. Okay sweetie, are you ready to go to the park? - Yeah. - Okay, now listen to mommy all right. Okay. - I want you to be a good girl. Okay. - And I want you to listen to auntie Lee. Okay. - And I want you to remember that mommy loves you so much. - I love you too, mommy. - All right kiddo, you ready? Yeah. - All right, let's go. Hey, be careful. All right, kiddo, let's do it. - Thank you. After performing 1,248 lifesaving surgeries I still believe I can do better. In fact, we all can. And with what I will share today, I hope we will.

Come on, baby, you're gonna stay with daddy tonight. Hi, this is Jade. - Yeah? - It's me. The cops are still there but it looks legitimate.

How does it feel to be Mrs. Thompson? - Perfect. Got my perfect flowers. Detectives, have you found her? - Not yet. Can we come in? - Of course. Come right through here. - You said Jade has a history of depression? - Yeah, she does. It started after her parents died. I helped her get it under control but about a month ago, I noticed her spiraling again. - What about the abuse? - Jade doesn't drink or use any other drugs. We don't even alcohol in the house. - The physical abuse? - I'm sorry, I don't follow. - Jade's sister came into the station. She told use Jade recently confided that you'd been abusive during your marriage. In fact, she said Jade thought you were trying to have her killed. - I'm sorry. I don't know where Lee would've gotten that from, but you're aware she's bipolar, aren't you? And a drug problem. I mean she disappeared for 10 years living on the streets. She didn't tell you any of this? - No, no she didn't. - Lee has some really shady people around. She even claimed she was being followed. Now I don't know if that was in her head or if it was real but now she's telling these stories about me, why? Because I have my reservations about her? You tell me detective, as a father and a husband, wouldn't you? - Well, thank you Dr. Thompson. You've given us some leads we can follow. - Thank you. Detectives, what do I tell my daughter? - I would tell her the truth, that you don't know where her mother is. - Thank you. There's my wife. How does it feel to be Mrs. Thompson? Perfect. Got my perfect flowers and got my perfect man. That's all I need. Well from now on you are my top flower. I love you. - I love you too. We got married.

Las Vegas 68, Los Angeles 72 with a high of 82, Georgia 56 degrees with a high of 71. And now Jen has a local story. Jade Thompson, a local mother and wife has been missing since yesterday morning when her estranged husband, when Dr. Edward Thompson called police to her home. So far detectives on the case have given very little clues as to what may have occurred other than to say her disappearance is considered suspicious. We'll be right back after these messages. - If it has to be clean. - Dr. Thompson. This is alouette, calling just to confirm your reservation tonight for two at eight o'clock. - There must be some mistake, I didn't make a reservation. It was made under a Jade Thompson. Shall I confirm it? Hello? I got the cash and her body's dealt with so now we're done. Hello. Apparently there's a reservation under Thompson. Here we are, for two, right this way. - Sorry, I don't suppose you know when the reservation was made, do you? - Sorry sir, we don't keep a record of that but a card did arrive for your table so if you'll just follow me. A server will be right over with the wine list, but the chef has already been instructed to prepare you and your wife's anniversary dish, the chateaubriand. Enjoy. I got the cash and the body's dealt with. So now we're done. - What the hell do you want? - I need to talk to you about Jade. - Why? So you can tell me a bunch of lies like you did the police about what a drug addict and a crazy bitch I am? I don't think so. - Look, she made a dinner reservation for us for our anniversary. I just need to know did she do that before to reconcile? - Seriously? You tried to kill her ed, so trust me she wasn't planning on celebrating your anniversary. And let me tell you something, if anything has happened to her, I'll kill you myself. I got the cash and the body is dealt with. So now we're done. - What are you doing, sweetie? No, no, no, no, not in the street. Get out of the street, baby. Kayla, where are you going? Where are you? Where are you, Kayla? - Kayla! Kayla, where are you? Kayla baby? Kayla?

Leave a message or don't. - Why don't you answer your god damn phone? - We were done. - No, 'cause I want to know if you did the job. - You saw it, the cops saw it. - Then why the hell does it feel like she's still alive? I just want to know, I just want some proof, that's all. Show me that you did what you said you were gonna do. - Is that the proof you're looking for? - She never took this off. - I told you I did the job just like I got paid to.

Oh my god! - Kayla! - Mommy! Mommy! - Oh! Oh, I missed you. I missed you so much, baby girl. - Where did you go, mommy? - When you get a little bit older, I can tell you why I had to go. Okay. - And the best part is you don't have to see mommy cry anymore. - Okay. - Okay, so I think that we should go to the park and we should get some ice cream. So, what kind of ice cream do you want? Strawberry!
