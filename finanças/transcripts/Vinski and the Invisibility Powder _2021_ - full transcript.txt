Brazen crimes and robberies are now a reality for people in Hömpstad. The city leaders and the police are helpless, as this crime wave sweeps through our beloved town. Are the citizens safe anymore? The undermanned police force's only clue is the main perpetrator's yellow gloves. VINSKI AND THE INVISIBILITY POWDER Mum! Mum. - I wasn't sleeping. You always say the cream will curdle if you beat it too much. I just rested my other eye. - You snored. Hey, I need to bake fifteen cakes today. But today is my... - I know. Your last day at school. And you need to wear a dress shirt. No, this is fine. - A dress shirt. This is fine. - A dress shirt. ANOTHER BRAZEN BURGLARY - CRIME WAVE HITS HÖMPSTAD Hi. Hi, Juuso. Hey, Vinski. Step in that! No way. And then we have Roosa. An incredible report. You've worked really hard. Have a nice summer. - Thanks, you too. Vinski. There must be water damage at his house. Or he peed himself. Juuso! This report could be better. You can't seem to concentrate. - Okay. Thank you. Good job, Vinski! Come on, now. Julia! Hey, Vinski. Want to play soccer with us? Yeah, why not. There's just one thing. You need to shower first. Right... - Cheers! Hey, leave Vinski alone! - Roosa. Just go play with your dolls. Is that the best you've got? Super embarrassing. What are you grinning at? Prepare to get wet. Contact us if you feel unsafe. Home security. One for you, madam. Good day. - Good day. Postmen sure have nice uniforms these days. I'm not a postman, but I'm delivering good news. I'm Antero from A-Security. - I'm Krista. I'm delivering a cake. - I can see that. I offer home security services at a reasonable price. Are you interested? No, thanks. It's pretty safe around here. Are you sure? Have you read the papers or watched the news? Yes. They exaggerate these things. - That's true. But if I may bother you a bit more... You can always change your mind. If you feel unsafe, you can contact me any time. Call me! If you feel like it. - If I feel like it. Do you sell alarms? - Yeah, sir... Mum? Hi! What happened to you? - I fell over. Which one is my birthday cake? I'm so sorry, darling, I forgot. I'll bake it right away. What cake do you want? Cheesecake, chocolate? Anything you like. I want ice cream. - What? You've baked enough cakes already. You're the best son in the world. I'm sorry. Also get some plasters and disinfectant from the pharmacy. PHARMACY - CLOSED OPEN Hello? Hello. Hi. How are you, Vinski? How do you know my name? It's a small town. News travels. Is the pharmacy open? How so? - There was a sign. A bit of road rash, eh? Yeah, I need plasters and some... dis-in... Disinfectant? - Yeah. Good. This way, please. Does it sting? - No. And we're done. How much does this cost? - It's on the house. But my mum told me to buy some plasters and... ...difin... Disinfectant. - Yeah. All right. Here you go. Anything else? - That's all. Have a good day then, Vinski. Is there something wrong with your sign... I thought you'd never ask. There's nothing wrong with it. Do you want to know a secret? Invisibility powder. What's so funny? - Invisibility powder? Yes. It makes you invisible and also allows you to walk through walls, if you want. I reckon you've walked into a wall. Many times. Don't you believe me? - No way. Into walls. Where did you go? Nowhere. - Whoa! Wow indeed. Do you want to try it? So... Say the magic words and stamp your foot. And don't stay invisible for too long. There may be side effects. Into walls! Am I invisible now? - Yes. You'll become visible again by reversing the words and stamping with your other foot. Now try going through a wall. Vinski... You lost. Pass it to me. Walls into! How did you get there? - I threw the ball. I was invisible. I know it's hard to believe, but I've got this invisibility powder, and... And... Walls into! Your powder is stupid! Oh? Didn't it work? Did you forget the magic words? It worked, but... Vinski, I hope you understand that you can't tell this secret to anyone. I don't want to be invisible. - The powder is running out, so you must use it for important things. This town has a lot of unsolved matters. Whoever can use this powder is able to help. Help with what? - Preventing these robberies. Why don't you do it? - I'm way too old for it. The powder doesn't give you any other superpowers. I was beaten up because of your powder! So thanks a lot. Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday. Blow. What did you wish for? - I can't say. Or it won't come true. - Oh. Vinski, I hope you know that I love you every day of the year. Even if I forget your birthday. And I should never forget it! - Yeah, I know. Hey, tomorrow is your first day off school. After I've delivered the cakes, we could do something fun together. Okay. - Okay. And one more thing. After you've eaten, you should put some toothpaste on this, put this in your little mouth and brush all over for a bit. I came down and saw that everything was taken. You didn't hear anything? - No, I was sound asleep. And the boy? Do you have insurance? - It won't cover it all. I've ruined dozens of parties. I should've bought the alarm system. Oh, dear. We are severely unmanned. We would need a hero. This town needs a superhero to catch these villains. Pharmacist! Vinski. I want to use the powder and become invisible. Why? I want to become a superhero. But why do you want to be a superhero? Think carefully. I want to help. A good answer. What do I have to do? All in due time. First we need to go somewhere... incognito. What? - Unnoticed, unseen. Into walls! This way! Hi. - Watch out! The first rule of invisibility: No one can see you. But they can hear you. Hush. Walking through walls makes me dizzy now that I'm old. It's one of the rare side effects. That's why you should avoid walking through walls unnecessarily. Mrs Naranteri is the richest person in Hömpstad. She owns half the town. The rumour says that in her house, there are priceless gems, gold, money, and other valuables. She's the one we're helping? A rich lady? We need to help everyone, even though she has... ...helpers of her own. Let's go. We have no time to lose. Thanks for coming so quickly. - Of course. My job is to serve. It's better to know you're safe than to think you're safe. Yeah, I understand that... now. Have you had time to think whether you want the basic package or the deluxe version? I can barely afford the basic package. Well, we can always negotiate. As long as you're safe. What's this old shack? "Old shack". It is my home. Or was my home. It used to be a fancy house. For real? You're old, dude. - Yes, I am. It's quite hot in there. - It's these big windows. We're almost done. We just need to type in the correct code. Come here. Let's do this together. Like this... You've got 30 seconds. The motion sensor is now on, look. This'll wake you up at least, huh? - It sure will. Then we just use the same code. There. What do you think? This'll scare the burglars away, but it doesn't mean they'll get caught. I'll install a direct alarm to the police station, free of charge. Okay, wow. Would you like some cold apple juice and a piece of freshly baked pie? Yes, please. Okay. - Yeah. Sorry. Wow! Is this now our headquarters? Yes, exactly. Our secret headquarters. This way. Has this place ever been cleaned? There it is. What do you say? Did you make this? Old people have time. See those pins? - Yeah. This is strictly organized. Red houses have been broken into. Blue ones are shops and businesses. And green ones are houses that will probably be burglarized in the future. Hey, one pin is missing. What, where? Here. Krista's Bakery. It was broken into last night. Were there any other break-ins on that street? Not as far as I know. I see! Tonight, the burglars will have a surprise waiting for them. What surprise? - You of course! The man himself! Do you have any idea where they might strike next? Sure I do. But we can't be in seven places all at once. Then what will we do? - This is like playing chess. You need to think two moves ahead. But wherever the robbery takes place... ...the only escape route is... Heather Street. Have you lived here long? - Not very long. Me neither. I was raised here, but I lived somewhere else. It's a nice little town. - But a bit inward-looking. Why did you come back? - I divorced my ex-husband, and then Vinski and I moved here, and I learned how to bake. You learned very well. - Well, thanks. You have a son? - Yeah, Vinski is ten. Where is he? - It's his summer break. He likes to be by himself. Do you have kids? - No, not yet. I'm all single. - Oh. That's a surprise. I should probably... - Of course. You've got my number. - And you've got mine. It was nice to meet you. - Likewise. And thanks. I feel very safe now. Bye. - Bye. We've waited for like eight hours already. We've been here exactly 17 minutes. By the way, superheroes never go to the toilet. I don't know much about being a superhero. But you are a superhero. You're just a bit... old. Can you please stop harping on about my age? The thieves' van! The powder! Aren't you coming? - No. Why not? - I've walked through too many walls. I feel dizzy. You need to go. And remember. You're only a hero if you don't take unnecessary risks. You just made that up. Into walls! Do you have any food? I'm starving. - Let's go to a hot dog stand. This should be enough for a couple of hot dogs. Did you actually steal a piggy hank from a kid? We're thieves, right? - Yes, but you could've stolen something else. Like what? - Like gold watches and necklaces. Can you pay a hot dog with them? - We can exchange them for money. There's money here! - Yeah, like four euros! Don't yell! You know I don't like it. Brake! What's that? It doesn't have legs. I don't care. It's as good as gone. Hey, Marko... Marko, let's go. Mika... Marko. No, no! Marko... Walls into! Hi. Do you have any idea what time it is? I don't have a watch. - I do, and it's extremely late. Well, I'm on a summer break. - But you can't run around all night. Where have you been? - With friends... Friends? - Yeah. What friends? - Just friends. And what did you do? - We played games and... Okay. I'd like to know their names. Okay, just one friend. - Does he have a name? Well? Roosa. Roosa? - Roosa. Oh... - What's that sticker? I bought an alarm. A-Security installed it today. Antero is the installer's name. Can I go to bed now? - Of course you can. Should we meet at that place by the beach? Yeah, I love it... - Mum! Do you like fish? Me too! No way! Mum! - No, you're silly. I've got to go... See you there. Bye. Who was it? - Just... a friend. An acquaintance. - Why do you talk to your acquaintance like a... Like what? - An idiot. What do you mean? - "No way! I like fish too." "Don't be so silly. Ha ha! Bye." Adults do that sometimes. Hey, did you see this? "One of the robbers said he saw a ghost in the street and that he was attacked by a fire extinguisher." "The prosecutor demands a psychiatric assessment.“ Serves them right. - There was someone there besides the police. I thought they looked goofy. - Who? The robbers. I saw... a picture in the newspaper. Let's do something together later? - No, I promised someone... Roosa? I see. What are you two planning? A bit of kissing and... ...some cuddling... - I thought you had a date too. At a place by the beach. With a "friend". Are you going into a kissing booth? He's just a friend. We'll have a friendly conversation. I need to open the bakery! What about tomorrow? - Okay! A brilliant start. Now let's roll up our sleeves! WHO IS THE INVISIBLE SUPERHERO? The police has made several arrests, but the citizens demand answers. Who is the mysterious invisible superhero? Or does he even exist? The crime boss is still at large. The only clue is a pair of yellow gloves. WHO IS THE INVISIBLE SUPERHERO? Hello. - Hello. Thank you. Hi, you're Roosa, right? - Yeah. Vinski's classmate? - Yeah. Hi! I'm Vinski's mum. - Okay. Vinski told me you've been spending a lot of time together. Vinski, where are you going? - Out. To do what? Are you going to see Roosa? - Yeah, that's right. Vinski. Why are you lying to me? - What do you mean? I just talked to Roosa in the market square. You haven't been hanging out with Roosa. Okay, I lied. But for a good reason. - What is it? I'm the invisible superhero. Vinski... - I've got invisibility powder. I'd show you, but the bottle isn't here, and I can't say where it is. I understand. I also had imaginary friends... I'm telling the truth! And that's why I will also tell you the truth now. I'm dating someone. A man called Antero. Antero from A-Security? - Exactly. We hit it off, and now we've been dating. Right... Can I go out now? - Yeah. Promise not to lie anymore? - Yeah. What was the first rule of invisibility? That no one sees you. - Which also means that you can't reveal the powder's secret to anyone. It's unfair. - Really? How many robberies have you solved? How many crooks have got caught? How many people have got their belongings back? That's fair! Drink your tea. What's this? I didn't add this. I put it there. What is it? A guy lives there. What guy? - Antero. All right... Vinski, you know we still have work to do. The powder must not be used for personal business. This is the last bottle. And you must use it with consideration. Where can we get some more? There's more, right? These aren't normal apple trees. The fruit must be dried and pulverized, which gives us... Invisibility powder. - Exactly. But it will take time before they're ripe. Vinski. - Yeah? Antero dating your mother is not a crime. I know, but... - Use the powder wisely. You're the invisible superhero now. No one else. Thank you. - Madam. Into walls! No, this is my kingdom now. You're not allowed to help. What are you going to make? - It's a surprise. Wow, a cool fire gun. - A big flame. Your job is just to enjoy. Make yourself at home, and I'll serve you. - Okay. I can do the dishes later. - We'll see. I love having you here. Walls into! PRICELESS SAPPHIRE TIARA IS THE GEM OF NARANTERI'S COLLECTION WHO IS THE INVISIBLE SUPERHERO? Into walls! Smoked river lampreys à la maison. It's a delicacy from Western Finland. Here's a big one for you. You can add some lemon if you like. - Okay, yummy. Is it still alive? Do I have to eat it alive? No, they're all smoked. Oh, okay. Listen... I’ll just go and wash my hands. Hello? Hello? Am I in the same room with an invisible superhero? Show yourself. Show yourself. We can talk about cooperation. All right. I guess that was a "no" to the cooperation? Not at all. I like you, but... I can't stand lampreys. I'm sorry, don't be mad. What happened? Why don't we just order some pizza? - A great idea. I'll do it. Stay put. Where are you? Show yourself. Do you need help? Everything's fine! Where are you? Antero? - Everything's fine! I'll have a Vegetariana. Where are you? Antero, what's going on? Nothing. I'm preparing a surprise dessert. Will you be all right if I go and clean myself up? Hi, Vinski. Our invisible superhero. Hi! Vinski! What's the matter? - I need to talk to you about Antero. Okay? Antero is behind the whole crime wave. He's a crime lord. No way. No, I mean it. I found the yellow gloves in his basement. Where? - In his basement. I was invisible... - You were invisible again. I hit him in the head with a lamprey. Did you spy on us through the window? - No, I... It's very rude to spy on people! What were you doing there? Vinski! I know it's been hard for you when I'm always busy. But I promise it'll be better from now on. You don't have to be alone anymore. - Go away! Leave me alone! Be on your way! No loitering! Mrs Naranteri's valuables aren't safe as long as that company is protecting them. What? A-Protection. The owner is a fraud. What are you saying, boy? Get out of here! No! No! What are you doing? Hey, Vinski! Sorry that I told my mum that we're friends. I had a good reason. What reason? - I can't say. I've got to go. Sorry once again. Hello! Pharmacist! Pharmacist! Hi there. Where's the pharmacist? - Not here today. Rarely is these days. just a few shifts here and there. She mostly works in the pharmacy at the mall. No, I'm looking for an old man. White hair, slightly crazy eyes. Oh, you mean the pharmacist's father. He retired long ago. He hasn't worked here in years. They had to move him to a facility. He had been ill. Would you like to buy something? You have a visitor, Pharmacist. A young sir, Venni. - Vinski. Right. He likes to look at the garden. But don't expect him to talk. Well, I'll leave you two alone for a moment. Pharmacist. Hey... Can you hear me? Our hiding place has been bulldozed. The powder trees have been destroyed. Do they grow anywhere else? What shall I do? That crook... I don't know. He'll probably try to marry my mum or something. And there's nothing I can do. Why is my mum so stupid? Pharmacist? Pharmacist! Can you hear me? What's up, dude? Nice bike. Are you Vinski? I thought so. I'm a friend of your mum's, Antero. Your mum said I could take you for an ice cream. Do you like ice cream? Do you have a favourite flavour? You don't have to choose. Have as many scoops as you like. Or a milkshake! What do you say? Well? Go on, eat it! You look at it like it's poisoned. Good, huh? You can trust me. I'm glad we're getting to know each other. You're a crook! I'm an honest businessman. - You break into people's homes and then sell them alarm systems. - What are you're talking about? Can I ask you a few questions? You see, I've got video footage of you turning invisible and then back visible again. You appeared in my yard out of nowhere, boom. How did you do it? Was it a trick of some sort? It was a trick. A mirror... I had invisi... What did you have? - Invisibility powder. Invisibility powder? - You can walk through walls with it. Wow! Where did you get it? From NASA? From CERN? From the pharmacy. Just over the counter? Okay. Could you get me some? - There isn't any left. Don't lie to me. I can tell you're lying. I'm not lying. - Fine... How about this? I think you lack motivation. I can help you with that. Get me some of that powder, and I promise to reconsider marrying your mother. What do you say? What? Oh, you didn't know? You didn't know. I proposed to your mum, and she said yes. That's right. And it's no wonder. I'm totally irresistible. I have a proposition. If you get me that powder, I won't marry your mother. Which, of course, will break her heart, but this is more important. Get me that powder. - There isn't any. Get me that powder. There isn't any. - Get me that powder. I don't have any, and even if I did, I'd never give it to crooks! Vinski... - Leave, or I'll scream so loud that someone will hear. This was your decision. See you at home, son. Mum! Are you home? - In the living room. What do you think? We're going to be a family. You, me, and Antero. So, do you like the dress? I think the logo of Antero's company would suit it nicely. You mean a big A back here? I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner. You're the best thing that's ever happened to me. Sorry, I'm late, but now you got to sit in your beloved garden... Pharmacist? Pharmacist? Mum? Walls into. Vinski... I knew it wasn't you! Who? - The old man in the nursing home. Ah, it was a disguise. I found one in a safe place. Thanks, but... The trees were destroyed. Do they grow anywhere else? - Of course. But far from here. This is all that's left. I wouldn't want to repeat myself, but... Use it wisely, Vinski. But what about you? - I'm going on a trip. Where? - Far away, where the trees grow. You can't leave! - Why? I know that Antero is the main villain, and he's going to marry my mum. But I also know what he's after. Mrs Naranteri's vault. Even Antero can't break into it without something that will help him walk through walls. Good job, Vinski. The job isn't finished yet. - Vinski... You're ready. I don't feel like it. - Don't be shy. Be brave. And besides... I never had a chance to tell you why I chose you. The invisibility powder is only given to people who are extremely honest, selfless, and brave. People like you. It wasn't a coincidence that you came to the pharmacy. It was you! You stopped Juuso from drenching me. Have you been following me invisible? - I have. Isn't it illegal? Every once in a while, old people can break the law a little. Vinski, you're a superhero now. And you have your own rules to follow. I'm going to miss you. Vinski, you'll remember me. That's what matters the most. Sprinkle a little on me, for the last time. Goodbye, Vinski. - Goodbye. Into walls. A company car as your wedding car. Real classy. I know, right? You know what it's perfect for? For our summer trips together, son. There'll be loads of them. You can still give me the powder, and your mum stays single. Do you see any powder on me? - It takes a liar to know a liar. You have until the priest says amen. Your breath stinks. - This is your decision. Either you do, or you do not. We should go. - Vinski walks me down the aisle. Where is he? Where were you? I almost left already. Sorry, do you have it? - Yeah. Thanks. Could you do me one more favour? Bye! Where were you? - In the loo. Nervous stomach. - Right. Let's go. We're gathered here on this sunny day to celebrate love and to unite you, Antero and Krista, in holy matrimony. To guide you to the harbour of love, where you will jump into the love boat and into all the storms and rough seas that life will bring... Let's cut to the chase. Krista. Do you take Antero for your lawful husband, to have and to hold for better and for worse? I do. And Antero. Do you take Krista for your lawful wife, to have and to hold for better and for worse? Antero? I do not. What? I don't really love you. Do I have to, if I... Get out of my sight! Get out of my sight! That went well. All right, now you'll see a pro at work. We know that the Naranteri house is empty. My security system monitors the house, but check this out. Not anymore. This'll get me through the gate and the door. The only place I can't get in is... - The vault. Soon you will. Are you sure? - I always keep my word. You'd better. I can walk by myself. - Be quiet. Come on. There it is. The only door in this town I can't get through, and I must get through. Here. Is that it? Okay. What shall we do? First we sprinkle this on your head. - Yeah, okay. Wait! How do I know you're not lying to me? I'll do it myself first, and you'll see I'm not lying. Am I invisible? - No. Then... Use your right foot to stamp on your left big toe and say the magic words. Into walls! Vinski... Vinski! I'm here! - Good. Here I come. Into walls! Am I invisible now? - Yes. Now what? - Now we just walk briskly through the vault door. Let's go! - One, two, three, four. Walls into. - Walls into! Mine! Mine! This is all mine. Look! And look at those. They're mine. Mine, mine, mine. I'm rich. I'm rich! I'm rich! I did it, mum. Your son did it. Wait a second. Wait a second. How are we supposed to get out of here with all this stuff? Did you trick me? - No, I didn't. You tricked me. - No. You tricked me! - No, I didn't. You tricked me! - No, I didn't trick you! All you need to do is put all this stuff on you, for example in your pockets. And when you turn invisible, the stuff turns too! You're a genius. Genius! So let's wear all the goods! Let's go, boys. I'm ready. The powder. Hurry up! Did you really think I wouldn't avenge the humiliation? You can wait here as I call the police. They'll catch the real criminal! Into walls! See you, loser. What happened? You just sprinkled some glitter and baking powder on yourself. And the police has already been called. So bye... loser. Into walls. Vinski! No! Vinski! Into walls... I want money. Into walls. Come back! Walls into! The crime wave in Hömpstad has come to a happy end. The crime lord, who managed to lock himself inside Mrs Naranteri's vault, about 40-year-old man from Hömpstad, is now being taken into custody. - It was an invisible boy! And this is all thanks to this young, alert person. Roosa, what's it like being a hero? Well, I just followed the instructions given to me. Right. Is there another hero? Yes, but he wants to stay incognito. I see? He is the invisible superhero. Thank you, Roosa. And thanks to the person who wishes to stay out of the public eye, invisible. This is all for now. An invisible superhero? I wonder who it is. - Yeah, I also wonder. It seems like you like Roosa? - She's just a friend. What are you insinuating? Soon you'll fall for another buffoon. Hey, a little empathy! I was just left at the altar. You can thank me for it. - True. Thank you. Hey, Antero! What? - I've got something for you. Ready, steady...
