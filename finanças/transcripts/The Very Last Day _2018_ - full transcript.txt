"Don't be scared, I don't want to hurt you." Millie stares at the smiling young man. It’s the same smile he had when they first met. Now there’s also lust in his smile that Millie doesn’t understand. Millie tries to back away, but her escape is stopped by the altar. “Why…” Her question is cut short as Alan rushes towards her. Her shirt tears as he grabs her. Her scream resounded all over the silent forest. There’s no one outside. Look, what’s going on here! Are you sure people know about my new book? Are you kidding me? In the last two weeks, I got you all kinds of interviews. Five interviews just for TV! And countless websites, radio shows, newspapers, magazines; daily, weekly, monthly, you name it! Half of Taiwan knows about the release of your new novel, OK? They know about it, but how many will read it? Who cares if they read it as long as they buy it! I care! I’m joking here, Raymond! And I’m glad to tell you that before your new novel actually hits the stores… ...the online pre-orders have exceeded even our most optimistic projections. So what? There’s still no one outside for today’s event! You’re a writer, not a movie star! I don’t care about fame, I’m just worried people won’t like my book. I can’t deal with rejection. Raymond, relax! I think you are missing the point of what we’re doing here. Fine! What is the point then? This event is a small gathering for… …our journalist friends and selected readers. We’re not here to advertise anything, but to celebrate the success of your new book. Success, what success? Have you seen the reviews? They’re killing me! Who’s buying your book, the critics? No, it’s those people over there, waiting outside. So please calm down and show some respect for these people, would you? Are you saying… Daddy! You found us easily? Very easy to find, but difficult to go through all the people waiting outside! Your father thinks there aren’t enough. Not enough, for sure! My dad is a super famous writer, there should be double that amount of people. No, triple! And mom, did she come with you? She’s parking the car, I just wanted to come first. Daddy, they have cameras! If Mom doesn’t come in time, it’s gonna be only me and you on the pictures. Wait a second, young miss! I’ve been working on your father since before you were born. So if there’s gonna be anyone on the pictures with him, that person’s gonna be me. But Dad… Listen, this is for work, I don’t have a say. We start in five. This is the event host, Brian. He’d like to go over the details with you. Hello everyone, I’d like to go over the details with you… Ah, Viola, so nice to see you! Would you like to keep Cynthia with you? We can’t have too many bystanders crowding Raymond on the pictures. Dad… Be good, we’ll go shopping with your mother after the signing, okay? - Hello… - Leave your father alone, he has more important things to do. What’s her problem? What did I do? Enough, stop it! - What did I say? - Enough! Hello! Ah, Raymond… Brian! Yes, I heard before: the host, right? Yes, that’s it; an honor to meet you, Mr Ho. Hello. OK, so at the beginning, I’d like you to stay in the back where the teenager stands. Then I’ll start with thanking people for coming today… Wait a minute… Thank you for gathering here today; it is our honor… …to introduce to you a very special person who’s born with the gift… …of intuition and sensitivity that allows her to seek out… …and cultivate talented people. It’s easy to say that… …Marian is the most important woman in Raymond’s life. It’s like they’ve known each other their whole lives. Ladies and gentlemen, let’s give a hand… …to bestselling writer Raymond Ho’s publisher. The gorgeous, the stunning, the only Marian Chuang! How is it? What do you think? - The introduction… - It’s a bit… Perfect, just perfect! Pardon me. Are you talking to me? No, no, I’m talking to myself. I got this VIP badge, can I have a glass of wine like this lady here? Absolutely, all the drinks are complimentary for our guests. - Miss, what are you drinking? - Champagne. - What? - Bubbly. - I’ll have the same. - Here you are. - Thank you. - You’re welcome. This VIP badge makes me feel like a very important person. He’s quite handsome, don’t you think? No, that's not it. He’s not just handsome, he’s more like… …very attractive and very charming. What do you think? Have you read all his books? Kind of… I browsed through all of them. Why did you browse only? Well, I like the feelings, and the relationships, and all of this. But in the end, it always turns to… How do I put it? Anyway, all his books are the same; and it’s been like that since the first one. Remember? The story with the father and daughter. And you don’t like that? Me? No, I don’t really like that. But my daughter, she loves it! Especially when it gets too… I mean, too… - Well, you know what I mean. - Yes, I know. It’s a very remote place… Did you know that his wife is a writer too? But she doesn’t really qualify to be called a writer. Actually, she only writes articles in literary websites and magazines. All her articles are quite… heady. - Brainy. - Yes, brainy! Like I said, no one wants to read that kind of stuff: she has no talent at all. Have you ever read her articles? I don’t waste my time. My daughter does though, she likes it. Then again, my daughter would read just about anything! What makes you so sure she doesn’t have any talent? - Who, my daughter? - Raymond Ho’s wife. There, you just said it: she’s Raymond Ho’s wife! Convenient when it comes to getting published; it doesn’t matter what or how she writes. Take my daughter, she writes too, but she doesn’t have the network. She can write left and right, she still won’t find anyone to publish her. Hey, do you know? I read somewhere… …that his wife is a simple high school teacher. I think that’s still too good for her though, if you ask me. - University. - What? She’s a university professor. Still a teacher though, what’s the difference? Do you know what she looks like? I don’t. Do you? I don’t know either. I’m with the other winners of the VIP contest, we’re gonna have our books signed. Do you want to join? No, thank you, I think I’m going to go out, I need some air. Thank you, the interview is over now. There are drinks and food over there, thank you. What’s next? Five signings for the VIP contest winners and you’re free. - Where’s your mother? - I just saw her leaving. - She left? - She had her bitch face. - Cynthia! - Her bored face. Well, you’ve got to understand her. This kind of spotlight event is only exciting… …when it’s your spot that’s in the light! - What now? - OK then, let me sign these three books… - Five books. - All right, five books After that, we spend the rest of the day together. Great! Think about where you want to eat, we’ll go right after. Thank you, Daddy! Did you eat? What kind of question is that? If it’s that important for you to know if I ate or not… …maybe next time don’t ditch me at your book signing event. You’re the one who left. - I left? - Marian saw you leaving. Cynthia noticed how bored you looked. And instead of saying so, instead of saying anything, you left. I didn’t leave, I went out for a cigarette. - A cigarette? - Yes. In any case, you could’ve called. Couldn't you? - Couldn't you? - I thought that... Exactly, you thought. You thought what you wanted to think, nothing else! - Daddy? - Yes. I’m here to say good night. Wait! I’m ready. Good night. - Daddy loves you. - I love you too. - Dad? - Yes, Baby Doll? There’s something I want to talk about. What is it? It’s about… …school. - Is there a problem with your school? - The school’s all right. - It’s just that… - Just what? It’s just that… Alright, Dad, the school is too far! I’m very lonely there. Couldn’t I stay in Taipei? I could be closer to you; we could find any school here. Haven’t we had this conversation before? I have discussed it with your mother, we think this is the best school for you. I wish I had been that lucky when I was your age, to study in New York. After graduating, you could have anything you want. But I want to be with you. I want to be with you too, but it’s difficult now because… It’s because of Mom, isn’t it? She doesn’t want me around, she’s so jealous. Why do you say that? Because she’s jealous, of me… …of you, writing that stuff that no one reads. Someone should tell her that my daddy is the only one who can write in this family. You might try to tell her, but I wouldn’t risk it. I won’t risk it either. - Dad? - What is it? Marian, is she really the most important woman in your life? Why do you say that? At your book signing, that host said that when he introduced her. He said that she’s the most important woman for you. That’s just part of the show. Listen to me. In this world… …there’s only one woman who can claim to be the most important in my life. And Mom? “Mom” what? Is Mom important to you? She’s… Of course she’s important. You know, Mom’s Mom. Mom’s Mom. - Good night. - Good night. What? - Is Cynthia sleeping? - I guess so. Then what were you doing in her bedroom? I heard you talking. Nothing, I was just saying good night. So you’re here to say good night to me, too? - Good night. - I was thinking… I wanted to ask… I thought that maybe tonight we could sleep together. Why? What makes tonight different? I don’t know, I just thought… I have to say, for a best selling author… …you certainly have a way with words! OK then, good night. You know… …I’m doing this for your own good. To protect you from yourself… …and from others. No need to cry, it’s all your fault. Don’t try to make me feel guilty, you only have yourself to blame. The only thing I’m responsible for… …is that I should have known… …you were up to no good with those boys. I should’ve stopped it. I should’ve done that. I think this is punishment from God. God is punishing me. I was about your age at that time. I’ve been soiled too. I was pure then… …before lust took over me. This is why I’m being punished. Punished. But you and I are different. When it happened… …your grandparents threw me out and… …they disowned me. They said that my sister still had to marry… …and they couldn’t bear the shame I had brought on our family. I don’t blame them. They had no choice. Back then… …that’s just the way it was. I hope you’ve given up on getting married. Look at you, no one would take you. No way, you’ll never get married! What if people ask me… …why isn’t your daughter married? What can I tell them? What do you want me to say? Tell me! You’re just too pretty. So beautiful! I know… It’s not your fault if you’re pretty. But see what happened to you! Being so pretty, it’s a curse. Why weren’t you more careful? A boy pays you a compliment and you open your legs to him? Do you think you can believe them? Their compliments are nothing but lies… …to get us in bed. I told you so many times, but you never heard me. And what’s the result? You didn’t listen! I don’t understand: are you stupid or stubborn? It was all for nothing! Nothing! I can’t have you act as you please again. Don’t worry. Ma’s gonna fix it. Let’s start with your pretty face. Ma… Ma! Go park and join us at the departure gate! - See you, Daddy. - See you, Sweetheart. Why do you come with me every time to the airport? I could take a taxi. That’s what families do. Sure, normal families! But you’ll see, Dad won’t even come: he never does! Saying good bye is too hard for him, don’t you know that? - Sometimes I wonder who knows him better? - Watch your attitude! I know your father better than anyone, better than you ever will. So I was right, you really are jealous of what we have. What do you have? He’s your father, you’re his daughter: you two have nothing! - It’s sick to say this! - Whatever. - What? - Did he do anything to you? What was he doing in your room last night? What the…? - You can tell Mommy, I can stop him. - Are you crazy, did you lose your mind? I told you, I know your father better than you! It’s Dad, he’s not coming and he’s asking you to say goodbye for him. - So who knows him best now? - You are wrong about your father. You don’t know him that well, I only want to protect you. I don’t ever want to hear you say bad things about him again or I’ll tell! Don’t you threaten me! You don’t even know bad. You don’t understand. You're right, I don't understand why you even pretend to care about me! Are you done? I have a plane to catch. Cynthia. - Couldn't you have waited for me? - Oh, I'm sorry. I had some ideas that I had to write down, you know the feeling. Ideas... You have ideas? Since when do you have ideas, I would like to know? You haven’t had an idea of your own since we met. - You had a fight with your daughter. - Don't' change the subject! I’m not changing the subject: this is the subject. Every time things get ugly with Cynthia, or whenever you have… …a problem at the university, you have another go at me. - With good reason. - Sure! I found inspiration in your story with your father for my first novel. Everybody knows it! You even agreed to me writing that story, didn’t you? How many times will you bring that up? Will you ever stop? Never. It was years ago and I wrote more novels since then. True... You didn’t write only about me and my father. You also wrote about your sister’s death, your grandfather's disease, your best friends suicide. Should I go on? How can you call yourself a writer? You’re a grave robber. You only write about dead people, so you don’t have to ask permission. How convenient! It’s called inspiration. No, Raymond, it’s called theft. Think what you will. What are you doing? Where are you going? - We’re not finished. - I am. - Well, I’m not… - Take your time! Sorry to scare you. Who are you? What are you doing? I’m protecting you from the rain. Thank you. - I’m sorry, but who are you? - Don’t worry about that, I’m nobody. You must have a name though. You can call me… …Miss Melanie. - Miss Melanie? - Yes, Miss Melanie. Well then, good evening Miss Melanie. - My name’s Raymond Ho. - I know! I know who you are. So I take it you’ve read some of my novels? All of them. - A long time fan then. - No, not at all. I didn’t know you were a writer until I stumbled upon your new novel a month ago. Then I kind of became obsessed with you. That didn’t come out right. - Do you like the new book? - It completely changed my life. I didn’t know I had that much power. Why are you here exactly? What were you doing? I wanted to… I wanted to find a portrait of you like that one there. - But it looks a bit… - Indeed. - I’m really sorry. - No, no! What are you sorry for? No idea, I just feel like I always have to apologize. - Uh? - Nevermind. So how can I help you? Maybe send you a new one or…? Because this one’s really… I don’t know if I can ask. Yes, of course; please, do ask! Would you sign my book? Well, I mean your book. Yes, of course, no problem. - Do you have it with you? - I do, I do! I don’t get it. I’m pretty sure I had it with me. No worries, I’ll sign it next time, how about that? For real? You don’t mind? - Of course not. - Thank you! Thank you so much! Thank you. - Sorry, I have to go. - Stop apologizing! - I should be sorry for taking your time. - It’s all right. Goodbye then… - Miss Melanie. - Right, Miss Melanie. Goodbye, Mr Ho. Mister Raymond. Goodbye, Mister Raymond… …and good night! - Are you Mr Raymond Ho? - Yes, that’s me. Here’s your package. Please, sign here. - What is it? - How should I know? Thank you. It’s forbidden to look inside the packages, and I’m a professional! - A professional! - Thank you. [A Very Cold Summer: First Love, First Kiss…] [A Very Cold Summer by Raymond Ho] - Hi! - You? What are you… You said you’d sign it. Your place is gorgeous! It’s exactly the way I imagined it. - How did you… - I followed the courier to your apartment. Your gorgeous and charming publisher gave me your address… …but not the floor or the door number. - I’m not interrupting, am I? - I’m working. Sorry. I brought my book this time. No, let me rephrase: your book. Now you can sign it for me, as promised. Go ahead! Do you have something to drink? I’m so thirsty, dear Mother, I’m gonna die! Your wife and daughter aren’t home? She’s working. What a silly question! I’m sorry! And your daughter must be in school, right? Where do you send her? Miss… Miss Melanie, remember? Yes, Miss Melanie… Please tell me what you’re doing in my home? Like I was saying… …I brought your book so you could sign it, because… …and I thought… But I realize your reaction isn’t what I expected. I thought you’d be happier to see me. I must have misunderstood. Miss! Miss Melanie! I should apologize, I’m being rude. Yes, you’re rude. Or maybe I just don’t understand artists, that’s all. I’m very sorry, I just don’t like being interrupted when I’m writing. First I couldn’t work because of this courier with those cards, and then you… I’m sincerely sorry. May I sign my book? I mean, your book. Do you have a pen? Thank you. - Thank you. - It’s my pleasure. You might want to put those on? I don’t know why people even wear shoes in the city, the streets are so clean. When I was a kid, living in the mountain, there was mud everywhere, not like here… Dear Mother, I’m telling a bestselling writer stories about my boring childhood… - You should go back to work. - Alright, goodbye. Thanks again. - What are those? - Hello to you, too. What are these cards? What is this book cover? OK, I know, I should’ve told you about these before. Yes, you should have! I think you should know that the online sales are sky high. And according to the early numbers of physical sales reported by the bookstores… …your book is going to be out of print in a week or so. We always knew that your readership is mainly female. But now, feedback also shows that… …their average age skews younger than we originally thought. So this time we’re going to print 50,000 copies. And we’re going to use that cover design tailored especially for the new target readers. Something more romantic, or at least something less creepy than the first one. Everybody liked that cover! And we’re also going to put together a promotional tour around Taiwan. We’ll go everywhere to do more interviews on TV, on radio… the whole nine yards! - Still, it doesn’t tell me… - And there are these thousand collector cards… …for a thousand VIPs that you’re going to autograph by hand. Agreed on the TV and radio interviews, no way for the tour! I’m writing now, I don’t have time for this. As for this… …I don’t know how you came to think that I’d sign a thousand cards for VIPs. So you’re going to reprint these… …with my autograph. There… and I don’t want to hear about it again. How about the thousand that are already printed; what do I do with those? Not my problem. [Meeting someone is like writing the beginning [of a new chapter together. Raymond Ho] Good. - So, not mad? - Not mad. Still, I think it’s odd to position my book as a teenage romance. Sure, it’s a story about first love, but one that doesn’t end well… …to say the least. Unless you consider rape a happy ending. But that’s sick, if you want my opinion… …even coming from you. You know… …sometimes, what may look like rape to some… …might just be called passion by others. Like, for instance, as an example… …if you were to take me by force… …here and now. On this desk. I would only resist to make it more exciting for you… …but the truth is I’d enjoy it as much as you. I don't find it funny, you don’t even like men. This is humor… Humor! Speaking of which, is it your idea of humor to give my personal address to fans? I didn’t. Think of it this way: fans are the price of success! It’s impossible to talk seriously with you! By the way, how’s your wife? Why do you ask? What is Viola writing these days? I’d like a peek. We’re interested in publishing her. The “literary couple” angle is a sure hit, your female readers would buy it like hotcakes! Not interested, I have bigger fish to fry. If you say so. If you write your next novel in less than four years, unlike the previous one… …I’d sure be grateful! Hello? Meeting someone is like writing the beginning… …of a new chapter together. Wait! Shit, what the fuck? What’s wrong with you? What’s wrong with me? I don’t like to have an audience! This isn’t an audience. It’s just a kid! I bought you takeout. Do you like chicken leg? Why not? Thanks. - Did you eat? - Yes, I did. “In breaking news…” “Rising actress Michelle Chen is involved in a scandal.” “The father of her eight-year-old daughter is…” “…the lead actor of the famed soap opera ‘Love Is In The Hair, ’ Jason Chang.” “When reporters asked for more details, Jason Chang refused to make any comment.” “Moreover, he was very rude and uncharacteristically aggressive when leaving.” “- Let’s have a look. - Jason…” Can you believe this place still exists? Yeah, but it has changed a lot. The menu’s stayed the same. It’s nice that some things don’t change. Then again, there are more things that change than things that don’t. Can I ask you something? What? Is anything sacred to you? Why do you ask? You used a card from your publisher… …with the flowers you sent me today. Would you consider that very tactful? Let’s not go there tonight, OK? Yes, you’re right. We get along just fine tonight, right? We only talk about positive things, then everybody’s happy. Just like when you first invited me here… …you used a card too, and you wrote a lovely little message. I will never forget. - Vi… - Do you remember? - Viola! - I know, it was years ago… …but it means something to me that you never forgot. “Meeting someone… …is like writing the beginning… …of a new chapter together.” It was so beautiful, and so cleverly phrased. Since then, you’ve used that same sentence for all your autographs. Just as if it meant nothing special… …nothing sacred to you; just random words put together. You should have it pre-printed, you’d save yourself the trouble to write it again. See, even now I’m still thinking about your well-being. I know I don’t always make it clear… …but I do know how much I owe you. Without you, I would be nothing and no one. This is why I think that now the time has come: you should write! I mean really write, seriously. Wait, I’m not done! I’ve had a meeting with Marian. I really wanted her to see your work. She thinks you’re really talented, she’s definitely going to help you. All you have to do is write, whatever you want. It doesn’t matter what, Marian will publish it; she owes me that much. Isn’t that what you wanted? What do you think? You really don’t get it, do you? I fell in love with you at first sight, Raymond. It wasn’t exactly mutual… …or if it was you had a strange way of showing it. No matter what, I proved to you then that you could always count on me. I came to live with you in Taipei. Then we had Cynthia when I was hardly old enough to become a mother. And then, after years that felt like centuries… …your talent was finally recognized. Why? Because you exploited my most personal wounds; you exploited me. - I… - Shut up and listen! So you became a renowned writer. I’m really happy for you. But you forgot… You forgot who supported the whole family so that you could fulfill your dream. You forgot that I had dreams too. But now I feel I can help you. Don’t you think it’s too little, too late? And do you really think that my idea of personal achievement… …is to get published thanks to my husband’s network? Do you really believe that my life-long dream… …was to become Mrs. Raymond-Fucking-Ho? Enough already! You're right. That's enough. I’ll never mention it again. I didn’t turn my back on you. Raymond, it’s you… …over and over again… …it’s you who let me down. Forget what I said about Marian. It was stupid. But I really think you should write… …and I’ll help, too, if you let me. “You should write.” “I’ll help if you let me.” Everything is so easy for Raymond. He’s like a puppeteer. He who treats people like his toys… …and who throws them away when they are broken. That attitude might have been cute when you were younger… …and I guess I carry part of the blame for that. But I’m telling you: not anymore! I won’t… …lie to myself again. You know what your problem is? You don’t know what it is to hurt. You have never experienced real pain. This is why you steal the pain of others. You should really try to feel something yourself once. Oh, nothing too serious, you know. A small cut here, a little burn there; nothing that would kill you of course. But just enough to get an idea of how bitter the real world actually tastes. That way, at least, you could write from experience. No need to steal anymore. I already told you, Viola. I shouldn’t have used the story between you and your father… The “story”? Did you just say “story”? It’s my life! Fine, your life: I shouldn’t have used your life. I can’t write. Raymond, I can’t… I can’t write. Every time I try, I realize… …that the only thing I want to write about… …was already written by you. Son of a bitch: you’ve taken my life and put your name on it! How about me? What do I have left? Even before I get a chance to start… …the game’s already over for me. - I’m very… - Don’t apologize, I don’t believe you! I sometimes wonder what my life would be like if I hadn’t come to Taipei. If we hadn’t had Cynthia, if I hadn’t married you, would I be happier? I think I would; I really think I’d be happier. Have you decided yet? What are you doing here? Having dinner! People eat in restaurants, don’t they? So, I guess… …the angry beautiful woman I saw on her way out was your wife. - You saw my wife? She looked really pissed off when she left. Excuse me, may I ask you again what you are doing here? What do you want from me? Are you following me? Following you? Oh boy! You think too much! I just got here and there you are. So yeah, I figured I’d say hi because, you know, that’s what people do. But if I make you uncomfortable… …I can sit at a different table. So what do we do? You have two options. One: I stay… …and we have a wonderful dinner together. Two: you stay all by yourself… …and you languish in your sad and mournful solitude. So which is it? - You’re right, I don’t want to eat alone. - Yes, that’s option one! Let me invite you; you’re doing me a favor by keeping me company. This is too much honor. Save it: this is exactly what you had in mind! Dear Mother, the famous writer Raymond Ho is inviting me to dinner! If she could see this, my mom wouldn’t believe her eyes. So, what should we have, what do you recommend? The best dish is the seafood risotto; it’s my wife’s favorite. Your wife’s favorite… Very well. Is there anything else your wife likes… …that I should have too? I’m hungry! Are you sure you don’t want to take a shower? It feels really good. No, thank you. I shouldn’t be here. I think I should go. No, please. Wait! I really shouldn’t be here. Do you want this, maybe? Please don’t do that, cover yourself. - I’m sorry. - I should apologize for coming here. - I’m very sorry. - No need, I understand. You still love your wife. I guess… I’m not pretty enough then. Melanie… …you have no idea how much I desire you. But… I just can’t. That’s it, I can’t do this. Then… At least… Can we just lie down? Just that. Just that, and just for a little while. Can I put my hand on you? I really like to spend time with you. I like spending time with you too. I have a small house in the mountains. I was born there. Literally, I was born in that house. My mom doesn’t trust doctors, so... Would you like to go there with me? I’d cook for you. Why are you laughing? Because you know just how to tempt a man. Anyhow… …the house is in a very small village. There’s no one there anymore. The houses have been bought one-by-one by a property developer… …who wants to build I-don’t-know-what to attract tourists. That makes me sad. The place where I was born is going to disappear. Do you want to go home now? Alright. So… …do you want to go? To the mountains. I don’t know, my life is complicated at the moment. My daughter doesn’t want to study abroad anymore. My new book has just been published, and my wife… - Well, my wife… - I see. I can think about it. - You can think about it? - Yes. - So you’re not saying no. - I’m not saying no. I’m just saying… I can’t go with you just now. - So maybe later. - Yes, later. So… can I ask you one more thing? I’m not saying no. Can I kiss you? I’m not saying no. Ma, I’m sorry… …it’s my fault. Come here! Please, don’t do this. I won’t say it twice. Go sit down! You know I'm doing this for you? I know. Say “thank you, Ma.” Thank you, Ma. Don’t move. Don't be afraid. Be brave. Please take these two suitcases, I’ll come down in five minutes, thank you. What are you doing? - I’m leaving. - What do you mean? We’ve been beating around the bush long enough, don’t you think? What are you talking about? - I’m talking divorce: we’re done. - Stop being ridiculous. What about our daughter? You mean “your” daughter. She doesn’t see a mother in me. I’ve tried to warn her, I’ve tried to protect her. But no matter what, all I did was antagonize her. Besides, Cynthia is 15 now, she’ll survive. Kids that age can survive more things than you’d care to believe. Believe me, I know. What about me? - What about you? - If you leave me, what am I going to do? What are you going to do? I don’t know. You can find inspiration in our divorce to write a book. - Where are you going? - Home. - All set. - Are you sure we shouldn’t take my car? Don’t worry! The new models aren’t any better than my old car. Say, I hope you didn’t bring your computer, that’d be a shame. - I didn’t bring my computer. - Good thing! You’ll want to make the most of such a beautiful place. - I didn’t even bring my phone. - Very good. You’ll see, it’s going to be very peaceful. My house is kind of isolated, we probably won’t see anyone else. Great, I can’t wait! I’m glad you called me. You didn’t seem so sure last night. The truth is, when I’m with you, I feel like I’m a teenager again. Alright then, let’s go back in time together! Quiet! Will you be quiet or do you want some more? What did you put in the water? Are you trying to poison me? Are you trying to kill me? Are you trying to kill me? If I was trying to kill you, you’d be dead already. Now drink! Hey! It’s just going to help you relax. So you drink it all and have a little nap! Or you don’t and I end you right now… Your choice. It’s not poison? Of course not. Would I lie to you? Now drink, and don’t spill. What are you doing? Shame on you! Are you going to sell betel nuts? Putting lipstick on, little slut! Enough of you, you never listen! Ready to sell betel nuts, uh? - Ma! - You’re killing me! You never listen, all you do is cry! How dare you cry, am I being unfair? Ma! Help… Help! Here, I’m here. I’m here, help! I already told you, the village is dying, everyone’s gone. There’s only you and me here; it’s no use screaming. I don’t think I’ll be able to stay much longer either. It’s not about the money, I don’t give a damn about that, but the other villagers… To be honest, this is not an easy decision to make. This house is everything I have. And with my mom still here… I promised her I’d stay. I have to keep the house untouched, no matter what, but now… …what can I do? What would you do if you were me? I don’t care about your house, your village… …or your fucking mother! I don’t give a fuck about you and your fucking life! What do you fucking want, you crazy bitch! Help! Please, someone help! - Help! - I already told you… It’s… no… use… screaming! You’re really asking for it. My mother was right, you really can’t trust men. When my mother was a teenager, she fell in love with the village doctor’s son. Then she had me. Then the guy’s family said… …he’s too young, he’s just a boy. They told my mom not to ruin his bright future. Too young… He wasn’t too young to get my mom pregnant though. After she gave birth to me, the whole village felt it was better that… Anyway… …my mom brought me here and this is where we settled. But it wasn’t easy. Imagine, a single mother… …back in those days, raising a child, and no father in sight. Can I tell you a secret? I’ve always hoped that my father would try to find me. That he’d get to know me, see what I’ve become. But now… Better not after all. So, your mother… Your mother still lives here with you? No. She… was in an accident. We only had each other for many years, but deep inside we weren’t that close. She was quite… strict. You could even say harsh… In any case, not exactly easy going. On the other hand, I have a little bit of a temper myself… …as you may have noticed by now. We’d been fighting for so many years. After the… after the accident, we fought much less. Our relationship got a lot better. I hope I’m not boring you with my family drama. - Are you thirsty, do you want some water? - Yes, thank you. Wait here. I didn’t add anything, don’t worry. Why did you kidnap me? What do you expect from me? I’m not that rich, you know. I don’t want money, I’m not that kind of person. What I want is an apology. - An apology… I don’t understand. - You will understand soon enough. - Please, I’m begging you, let me go! - Let you go? - And then what? - And then nothing, that’s it. I don’t know who you are, I don’t even know your real name. I’m not lying, I’m begging you, I really just want to go home, please! My name really is Melanie: Melanie Chang. And we’ve known each other for a very, very long time. Now I have to take you to another room, so I need to untie you. Don’t try anything stupid, and just do what I’m telling you, understood? I understand. - You swear? - I swear. - Cross your heart? - Yes, cross my heart! I'm sorry! - I’m sorry, I apologize! - You apologize and so what? You swore, you crossed your heart, but you lied! No, I didn’t lie, I’m very sorry! Really, you can trust me, I won’t try anything again! This time, I trust myself. I was probably too young at the time, and I didn’t understand… …but I can say it to you now: I resented you. I’ve even hated you for what you did to me. I felt so angry all these years. But now… …time has passed. After all this pain, I finally understand. You weren’t punishing me, no… …you were only teaching me. Why do I understand only now? Because I finally understood that you only hurt those you really love… …and I guess before now, I never loved anyone enough to want to teach them. Just like you loved me. I finally know how it feels. Oh, good, Sleeping Beauty has awakened! Did you have a good nap? What is it? Are you pouting? No problem, my mom always says… “If you don’t have anything nice to say, don’t say anything!” There, now you can have a peek at my masterpiece. Wait a sec! I have to say, I did a pretty good job on your hair. What do you think? You like it? Is it that bad? Hey! No need to be so hard on me, I’m not a professional! I’m not even finished yet. I don’t know if it’s your wife or your publisher who gives you such poor advice on your look… …but your hair really made you look like a bum. I believe people should always try to look their best? Don’t you think? You know, we don’t get to choose what we look like… …but in the end, is there really anything else… …that follows us our entire life? Ah, good, time to rinse! You tell me if it's too cold or too hot, OK? Too hot, eh? Oh, suck it up, it’s not that bad! My mom always swore by the hot water hair rinse… …and look, my hair is beautiful now. Please, stop, I’m begging you! I can give you money! I don’t want money. I already told you, I’m not like that. Ah yes, you want an apology, alright. I apologize, I’m really sorry! Everything is my fault! Shut up! You don’t even know what you’re apologizing for! Go ahead, tell me, what are you sorry for? It hurts. It hurts? You tell me that it hurts? You don’t know what it is to hurt. Don’t worry, I’m gonna teach you. What are you doing? Why me? Why? Answer me for fuck’s sake! - What are you doing? - Wait a bit. What for? For it to get hot. For what to get hot? For what to get hot? Now you know what it is to hurt. Oh, I know… This is even worse. Are you finally up? I have a surprise for you, you’re gonna love it! Do you like it, Baby? Now I’m gonna make our dinner, OK? Just like I promised. Well, yes or no? Use your tongue while you still have one! Yes, yes; thank you. Well then, I better get to it. It's nice to see you haven't lost your appetite. Thank you. It’s very good. What would you like to do now? We could go out for a little walk. - For digestion. - What a nice idea! A little walk for digestion. And if I were to be distracted, you could make a run for it. Why did you kidnap me? You really don’t know? I’m sorry, please don’t get mad. I’m not going to get mad. Then why? A Very Cold Summer. A Very Cold Summer. You mean that it’s because of my book? I’m sorry, I really don’t understand. All right, let me tell you a story then. It’s Summer and all the teenagers are on vacation. Millie, wearing her school uniform as usual, walks through the village square to get back home. - No thanks. - Hey, Monkey! Hey, Millie, do you want a taste of my ice cream? You can share an ice cream with your big brother… I can’t, I have to go home. Of course not, Millie is a straight A student, she won’t hang out with us. Her mom said that she can’t have any bad friends. It’s not like that; I have to finish my Summer school homework. Summer school, did you hear that? Millie, we’re going to the abandoned mine tonight. Would you like to join us? What are you on about, there’s no way she’d come with us. Her mom would never let her go out anyway. Alright, I’ll come. Hey, do you hear what I hear? She said she’s coming! If she really comes tonight, my name isn’t Monkey anymore. - Then what’s your name gonna be? – Gorilla, gorilla… She won’t come anyway! - What the… - Stop laughing! Who’s next? Monkey, it’s your turn to tell us what’s your type of girl! Get up, hurry up! Alright, I’m gonna tell you. I’m a simple guy, I don’t ask much. - He doesn’t ask much… - …but how much does he ask? All right, first of all, the girl I like should have long legs. Long legs, long legs, long legs… Secondly, she must have this! Big boobs, big boobs, big boobs… - In conclusion, my type of girl is… - His type is… I know! Monkey wants anyone that’s not male! The type of girls I like are… …the betel nut girls! Alan, it’s your turn now, come on! - Come on, Alan! - Alan, Alan, Alan… Alan, it’s your time to speak:, what’s your type of girl! - How about the kind of girl I don’t like? - Oh, come on… Give us names! I don’t like tacky girls. Tacky girls… - And girls wearing too much make up. - Too much make up… Another thing I don’t like is when they show off their underwear. I know! - Like pink bras! - Pink bras! OK then, Alan… Why don’t you tell us about the kind you like now? I like clever girls. - Too bad, Chubby, not you. - Struck out! Back on the bench! And also girls who like to study. - The ones who study really hard. - Ah, book worms… Oh, college boys really have different tastes! Book worms are a complete turn off for me. Betel nut girls are better, right? And girls who dress very simply but are pretty inside. - It can only be Millie! - Millie! Alan’s dream girl is Millie! Together, together, together… No, that’s not it: married… …married, married, married… Summer runs its course. Millie and Alan spent all their time together. For the first time in her life, she has friends. For the first time, she’s part of a group. But this is all too good. It cannot last. And the holidays… …are coming to an end. - Millie? Tell me… Would you like to be my girlfriend? - I have to tell you something else. - Tell me. I’m going back to Taipei tomorrow with my parents. What? Summer vacations are over tomorrow and I’m going back to Taipei with my parents. So, you mean we’re gonna write to each other? Oh… No… That kind of stuff only happens in cheap romantic novels. Us boys don’t really write. Then why did you ask me to be your girlfriend? Well, I meant today, now! - What are you doing? - You know exactly what I’m doing. Go away! - I don’t want to! - Stop playing hard to get! I know that’s what you want! Or why were you peeping? Don't be scared. I don’t want to hurt you. He said these words as he was approaching Millie. Alan tore Millie’s shirt and pushed her violently. Then he ripped off her panties. And then you… …raped me. What? You raped me, you bastard! No, it wasn’t me! That’s the story in my novel you just recounted. Yes, and it’s our story you put in your novel, you sick piece of shit. I would’ve never known if someone hadn’t sent me your book. I guess you’ve pissed off the wrong person, you motherfucker! What? It’s impossible… Who would do that? In any case, whatever happens in the book, I made it all up: that’s what writers do! - Liar! If something like that happened to you, I’m very sorry… …I feel terrible for you, but I had nothing to do with it. You motherfucking liar! I was fifteen years old, you destroyed my life! It wasn’t me, you have to believe me: I’m really sorry for you. I don’t know who played that sick game, sending you my book and making you… …relive this horrible experience. But I swear to you I’m innocent, you have to believe me! You have to believe me, please don’t… …please don’t, please don’t… If you’re so innocent, why does the story of a teenager being raped give you a hard on? - What? - What is this then, an eggplant? - You are crazy! - You’re right, I’m crazy. How about you? You’re a fucking pedophile! Or maybe it’s the way I look that’s turning you on. How about this? Oh, you really like it. I think you’re gonna like this too… And now, does that make you horny, too? Do you want it? Don’t worry, I’m gonna take care of you. Lick my fingers! I won’t say it twice, lick! - Please don’t do that! - Are you afraid it’s gonna hurt? - I’m begging you! - It’s OK, it’s probably going to hurt you… …but it’ll hurt both of us, because I haven’t done it since last time… …with you. Help! Melanie, are you home? Just a minute, I’m coming! Dr Lee! Long time no see. Do you have guests? I heard voices. - I can come back later if you want. - No, I was just tidying up a bit. What can I do for you? Well, you know, it’s always the same thing. Can we talk about it some other time? I’d rather not have to come and bother you with this so often. But the villagers are losing patience now. They’re saying that… they’re going to take care of it. They mentioned hiring bad people. Got it. - When? - They said… It depends on who they contact. When exactly? Tomorrow… or the day after. Thank you, Dr Lee. Thanks for coming to warn me, you’ve always been kind. I’m leaving. - Good night. - Goodbye. Ma… You gave me life, care and strength. You made me the person I am today. I don’t know if I should thank you for that… …but I probably wouldn’t have survived without you. Now… …the time has come to set the past right. For this, I will use my bare hands… …to bury my life. Wake up, you’ve slept long enough! What is this? What does this mean? Why don’t you kill me, it’d be much easier. To kill you? Why would I be so nice? I want you to stay alive longer. I even prepared breakfast for you. Here… Now eat! I’m not hungry. You’re not hungry? I’m not hungry. And my hands are tied, I can’t eat like that. Dogs don’t need hands to eat. That shouldn’t be a problem for you. - No. - What no? I’ve had enough. I’m not playing anymore. You lost, your little game is over. My game? You think I’m playing a game with you? Now eat! No. I told you, if you want to kill me, kill me! But I won’t do what you ask, you’ve lost! “You’ve lost, you’ve lost…” You sound like those fake characters in your novels! Think what you will. I think you really don’t have the right attitude. What is that? What’s that taste? Don’t worry, it’s vitamins. Wrong direction! Don’t! Please don’t. Don’t be scared, I’m helping you. There, since you don’t enjoy my company, you can go. Go now! Still here? Do you want me to stab you? Don't be scared. I don’t want to hurt you. Don't be scared, I don’t want to hurt you. You should be scared now… …because I’m gonna hurt you real bad. It’s me. I did it. I did everything. Monster! It’s me. I raped her. I forgot. I just forgot. How could I forget? It’s all my fault. Shut up! Monster! I just forgot. Liar! Liar! Kill me… Kill me, kill me! You fucking shut up! I deserve to die. I’m a monster. How could I forget? Liar! You motherfucking liar! No one can forget this, no one! No one! No one… No one could forget this. It’s impossible to forget this! Kill me. I don’t want to live like this. Please, do it. - Do it. - Shut up! I will shut you up! You should've done that twenty years ago. Why did you ask me to be your girlfriend? I love you. Raymond! Raymond! Alan! Enough! It’s over. You hear me? It’s over. Raymond, everything is over. “A year ago, a young woman died in a fire.” “After investigation, the police have ruled out an accident and are calling it arson.” “The suspect is a local resident.” “It appears the young woman didn’t want to sell her land where a hotel complex was to be built.” “Her position became a problem for the property developer, which eventually lead to her death.” “They’re killers… Murderers, killers!” “They killed my daughter!” “They killed my daughter.” You shouldn’t watch that crap, it’ll fry your brain. Do you think he can hear us? I don’t know. But I think we should keep talking to him anyway. Cynthia, Honey, would you get us something to drink? Of course. - What do you want? - Anything, you choose. I know you can hear me, I just know it. So, Raymond, I want to share some good news with you. There it is, just like you promised. Marian helped me publish my first novel. I knew you’d like it. I’ll put it there so you can read it whenever you want. I’d really like to know what you think. [The Very Last Day by Viola Ho]
