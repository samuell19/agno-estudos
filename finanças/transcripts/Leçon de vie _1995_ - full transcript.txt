Before all else, man should know what to look at. The unawakened usually say they have a goal and a direction in life. When a person realizes he has no goal and is going nowhere, it's a sign that awakening has really become possible. Awakening begins when one realizes that one is going nowhere and has no direction to take. STORIES OF LIFE LIFE LESSONS But the azure laughing on The hedge and the awakening of so many birds in flower chirping in the sun. There is something, I'm not mad. However desirable it may be to know ourselves, perhaps we know better what is not ourselves. Nature gives us organs solely for our preservation but we use them to receive external impressions, seeking only to spread ourselves around and to exist outside of ourselves; too busy multiplying the functions of our senses and augmenting the external scope of our being. We rarely make use of that inner sense that brings us back to our true dimensions. MADMEN IN LITERATURE Eroticism... The Female Sex... GENESIS: In the beginning God created heaven and earth... And God said, Let us make man in our image and in our likeness... One apple plus one apple equals two apples. But one chair plus one chair also makes two: two chairs. It matters little whether it's an apple or a chair, mathematics tells us that 1 + 1 = 2. Using this science, some count their apples and others their chairs. And since everyone could count their money, no one wondered what's the purpose of learning to count?

We'll see the biggest fagne or mossy upland, here called the Grande Fagne du Plateau de Tailles, which covers some 300 acres. The most impressive fagne in my region, the Baraque Fraiture, our second highest peak all round the Baraque, in every direction are tracts of fagne, near the peak, here, situated in deep hollows with gentle gradients compared to the peak. It has some botanical features due to periglacial phenomena from the first glaciations to affect Belgium and its climate. Not bad, Jacques. Very good! Here's the autobiography of the great calligrapher who for me is the greatest. He lived in the 8th century. The text reads: I, Huai Su, from the town of Changsa, since early childhood, have studied Buddhism. Any time left after studying the sutras, I devote to calligraphy. My only regret is not being able to travel far and admire the relics left behind by our great predecessors. I understand that. - Do you understand that? - What's she say? She's asking you if you want her to come and meet you in Moscow. No, I don't. Anyway, she says phone when you get there and she says who you'll be staying with in Moscow. I'll call her when I get there. She's got something to ask you... Take coffee filters and paper napkins. They must be short of them in Novosibirsk. Warm clothes, boots, and a warm coat but she also says take light shoes to go to people's places. You can't wear boots indoors. You know that word? Your swimsuit. A swimsuit? Oh yes, for the seaside. But where's that in Siberia? No, there's no sea there, she means Lake Baikal. We'll have to look at an atlas. Have you got one? Yes, let's look in the atlas! You land in Moscow. Then I get the train, the Trans-Siberian. You cross the Urals. I'm leaving soon and don't even know where I'm going. You get to Novosibirsk and then take another train, there, I think, to Irkutsk there you're at Lake Baikal. Is there a larger scale map? Here you're in Moscow. You cross all that you keep going further, further... Novosibirsk, there you are! What's all this here? Forest, or plain? Forest, of course, taiga. And then you're here, and then Irkutsk. Your Lake Baikal! And then I'd like to find the River Amour! Dear sisters, dear brothers, to all of you, joy, peace. Joy of my eyes, listen to the silence of the dawn. Your hands of light on your heart, plum of welcome for your lips turned blue under the limpid crystal of the sky. Distress: I'm not coming tonight to vanquish your body. Ostraca - many of them have been found in Upper Egypt - are fragments of limestone or pottery. The inscriptions may be of many kinds: personal letters, or legal texts, or invoices and, above all, literary texts. With these ostraca we can sometimes reconstitute texts whose manuscripts are completely lost. Putting them end to end, if there are enough of them, we can reconstitute whole texts. This one goes here, surely. And that goes underneath. It must fit somewhere. The path to my house may have disappeared. I am not mad, there is something. I loved you Maybe love you still Deep in my heart Is not yet completely dead You understood what I told you last time about the past, the present and the future? Yes. The present is now. The past was yesterday and the future will be tomorrow. Good, give me an example. Well, for example, the present is me being here, and then the past is before the holidays, and the future will be tomorrow or the next day, or after the holidays. Could you tell me more exactly? The present doesn't have the same ending, the past, for group 1 verbs that's E acute. In group 2 it's not the same and the future as well. Blanche, do you think you know what the past is? Things past, or present. What do you think? Don't know. Well you do know that the past, present and future are inventions of the mind. There's a man who wrote something about this, long before yesterday, who said "Time is not an empirical concept". I don't understand at all! It means it's not a concept derived from experience. It's not something you could test. "In effect, simultaneity and succession would not fall..." It's too complicated. Look, simultaneity is things happening at the same time. Succession is one after another. Things at the same time, or one after another, we couldn't realize... They could not be perceived by us without the concept of time as a prior basis. In other words, we couldn't realize that things happen at the same time or one after the other if we didn't already have the idea of time, the idea that there is something we call time. You understand? "Time is not an empirical idea derived from experience. In effect, simultaneity and succession would not themselves fall within our perception if representation of time did not have a prior given basis. Only on that assumption can one conceive something exists at the same time as another - simultaneously - or at different times - successively." My first dreams, seven years old. Three times, I saw a small ball that vibrated and grew bigger like candy floss that you turn in sugar which sticks bit by bit and forms an enormous ball. For me, that ball turning and growing bigger was the creation of the earth. I began to see a beautiful river with water flowing, crystal clear. You could always see the bottom, even though the water was deep. Since then, whenever I fly away, I'm invisible in my dreams. As soon as I land on earth, I become visible again. But the azure laughing on the hedge and the awakening of so many birds in flower chirping in the sun. What could be called being was, on reflection, something having Parmenidean qualities, neither engendered nor destructible. Thought itself was also being, in this same sense. Parmenides perhaps also said this when he wrote: "Indeed, thought itself is also being." I say "perhaps" out of respect for those who translate this Greek sentence differently. And yet almost everything changes, and Heraclites says: "Everything flows." But he also says: "What is, is always." Parmenides and Heraclites, the general problem is stated: "It is unchanged and it changes." Contradiction? Paradox? The world is light. The world is composed of electromagnetic waves also called light. Like Parmenides we should add: "Thinking is also light, since what is unengendered and indestructible, being in the true sense - Parmenides - is light." ... and so on in this asylum arrive and then stay resonate like it or not dot the I's resonate and resonate the chance in her she harassing terribly devastating leading on joyful breathing broken if not even spread out necessarily arms cross on wood mattress or jacket thrown equal but always at arms body of obstinate desire slaps thighs according to the dull advance fast very fast much faster than this order dictated aloud precisely obscene that one singular thrown in the machinery saliva spent when the sun shines in my belly stuffed with commonplaces swellings hollows holes not necessarily sweating oozing humid dark or not but admittedly landscapes fainting what we've tasted seen felt touched not tasted not touched what we'd have wanted forbidden not forbidden and that mad with love as we are despite the lack just as we are thrown in panic where we can never mourn our loss in her harassing dazzling calling the harassed terribly devastating so I bawl after in the gap like the breathless idiot drumming intractable with neither braces nor belt mocking the society dancer in love lost as I knew how and so on commonplace harassed with a jump waking up yelling what you want with me?

POCKET SHELTER Go on! That skeleton doesn't move. Hit him again! Well done! Now I must go the other way. If l don't get past that thing... Ouch! That's a really difficult one... Armen. Do you know how he died, Lermontov? Who? Lermontov, the poet. No, I don't know. Misha. Hello, it's Valerie. Can you tell me how Lermontov died? The duel, I know, but what exactly were the circumstances? Do you know who I could ask? No? Okay, thanks. Hello, Vladik. Hi, it's Valerie. Do you know anything about how Lermontov died? Yes, of course. Lermontov fought a duel with Martinov. Yes, I know, a duel. But how did it happen? The actual duel? There was a storm, I think. Yes. You may recall the article by Merezhkovski, he refers to Lermontov as a fallen angel. And at the time of his death, nature was tormented... Storms, thunder, lightning. In the Russian film about Lermontov, his body was lying in the rain. Okay, if you find out any more, call me back. When? Today. LERMONTOV'S DESTINY Valerie, I'm calling about the duel. So? It was near Piatigorsk, on July 15, 1841. They stood very close with large-caliber pistols. A storm started raging just before the duel. The elements were tormented like his soul. Lermontov stood there smiling, his pistol pointed skywards. Lermontov shot in the air? Martinov took careful aim, and shot him straight in the heart. So he did shoot in the air. Thank you, Vladik. There's what seems to exist and what must disappear. I'm not afraid of you! It occurs to me that one of these countless tombstones could have my name engraved on it. Three little musical notes which tease you from the bottom of our memories. They raise a cruel curtain on so many pains that don't want to die. The serpent was the most cunning of all animals. And he said to the woman Did God say you shall not eat of every tree in the garden? The woman said to the serpent: We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden. But of the fruit of the tree in the midst of the garden, God said: You shall not eat of it, lest you die. No, replied the serpent you shall not surely die. For God knows that on the day you eat thereof, your eyes shall be opened and you shall be as gods, knowing good and evil. The woman saw that the fruit of the tree was good to eat, pleasant to look at and desirable to make one wise. She took some and did eat and gave also to her husband with her, and he did eat. And the eyes of them both were opened. Find oneself again and overcome the terrors of loneliness. When I wanted the whole universe, I asked my father what was beyond the most distant stars. My father answered: "Stars to infinity or perhaps an infinity without stars." I looked at my cupped hand, I could see nothing, nothing but a word: the word "infinite"... Later, my father said to me: "The universe, a sort of sphere with no outside, and finished". I looked at my hand, there was a space around it. Once I left the earth, at night. Without the slightest effort I reached the speed of light. I saw the stars shooting like from a moving train, telephone poles seen through the window. On my journey through the air I met my brother Francois, next to me. I said to him: "What a treat to inhale this pure sky". He said to me: "I want to return to earth". I replied: "No, turn right". Me, I went back to earth. I glided for ages along a wooded valley, there was a stream flowing in the valley. While opposite on the same wood the idiot like yesterday, the day before and before that tomorrow is covering will cover with signs the glossy pages of travel brochures and is tearing will tear in hundreds of pieces stuffed into his trouser pockets grimacing stunned rocked by what mirrorless farce? I can see nothing now. Silence I'm recording! The countryside is emptied of my characters. Water, sky, stones, grass, streams, rivers dead leaves, clouds, suns, dust, lines, points... is all that's left. The sound of the earth is getting thinner and weaker. In chorus, like a repeating echo, the shouts of my characters who have disappeared, now too far off to be seen. The place has carried on living without them.
