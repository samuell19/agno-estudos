Fear has always resided in this village. Fathers teach their children to fear... and as years go by fear turns to hate. Live here long enough and you start to hear stories. Stories never told to outsiders. Stories about marshland beasts. And a hoy who controls them. The villagers haven't dared venture on the marshes for years. But we are not from here.

Whatever. We got a bible somewhere? To study the commandments. Your mother's should be in the barn. "Love is patient, love is kind..." "You shall not commit adultery." Southern Ostrobothnia, 1972 Did you find it? Did you find the bible? Oh yeah. Your wedding picture was in it. Sit up straight, get the warmth in your navel. Why did mum leave? I don't know. Was there someone else? Inseminator Janisoja. Great to see you here at the vigarage on a Friday evening. My name is Sami, but everyone calls me Sampsa. So you can call me Sampsa too. I'm the brand new youth vicar here. If you wanna chat, don't hesitate to tug my sleeve. But... not when I'm playing the six string. Don't wanna lose the rhythm. Yeah hi everyone from me too. I'm Milla and your tutor here. Kinda like a mother figure for you guys. Tonight we might chat about people. About being different. About what people are like. That's normal for a teenager. Body hair, voice break, mood swings. It'll pass. Or... pass, my foot. He's becoming a grown man after all. Yeah, I'm not too worried about that. But he's begun asking about his mother. He's beginning to understand things. What have you told him? Nothing. I've mostly been quiet. You've been quiet. I've said his mother left when he was a baby. I've been thinking it's time he knew the truth. They say tree sap boosts fertility. - So they say. - They say all kinds of things. I wonder if we're late again. We always seem to be a bit late. What do you mean? This here trunk is dry too. You realize what it's like when people stare at you... ...they reckon I should be with child by now. It's in your head. That aren't we expecting yet. That aren't we in the blessed state yet. My time is running out. What did the inseminator say? What's he know. People're different from animals. He did say something didn't he. He's a professional. What did he say? My seed isn't strong enough. - More coffee? - No thanks. You had some concerns. I'm vowed to silence you know. Parishioners' business are not mine to spread. To anyone. Can I ask you something personal, vicar? Ask away. Ever think about getting a child? I reckon I have enough shepherding to do already... Achild of one's own is different. Father, at my age... I should go finish planting the tatties. Reckon I'll be out late. I guess I'll be on my way, too. You take your time, vicar. It's just you two now. Something on your mind, Eeva? Before we make my pancakes I thought we could sing a song. How about "Tilkkutakki"? Well nah that's a cliché. I thought we could sing this song I wrote. It's not quite finished, but we could perform it at church... ...When we've practised enough. I printed the lyrics, on the parish C128... ...it's called Song for Happiness. - Does it have a disk drive? - Huh? Does the C128 have a disk drive? Well duh! Cassettes were hot like in 1985.

The name's roots are in the early 19th century and war against Russia. It is said... ...a Russian patrol captured a boy to guide them to the next village. The boy led them astray in the woods. He brought them to the marshes, and they camped there. Results indicate they walked here. If 'm right, this route is still in use. Let's dig here. We must cover it up. Today's sermon is about love. What is love, really? Evolutionary reason for strong emotional bonds... ...Is to ensure the offspring reaching maturity. Thus also keeping one's own genetic heritage alive. This scientific view of love is rather selfish and cold. What about the Christian view? God showed his love by sacrificing His own son. Is love, then, about sacrifice? Let us pray for those we love. - Did you enjoy it? - Shh.. Well? Did you? Let us sing hymn 111. ♪ Oh dear Father ♪ ♪ For the sake of all that's good ♪ ♪ Forgive us our sins ♪ ♪ For sake of Your son's torment 2 Your judgement is righteous ♪ But please be gracious ♪ So we may be obedient ♪ 2 And in our faith ♪ We may serve thee I've been thinking about the name. If it's a boy, it could be Anselmi. After my father. And Manuel for middle name. It might be my kid. Like when earlies sprout poorly, but still yield a fine crop. What do you think? Eeva? PRINT "SONG FOR HAPPINESS" PRINT "SONG FOR ONANISM" PRINT "MUSIC AND LYRICS: SAMPSA" Anselmi! - Can't you knock? - I knocked several times! I've got something to tell you. Well? Should we warm up the sauna? I can't now. Gotta learn psalms for tomorrow. Oh yeah. We'll do it tomorrow. Your mother sat in this very spot. She came by often, to pray. Do you know what she prayed for? No, what? For a child. She was praying for you. Many have sat by a small child wondering how they'll turn out. What defines how anyone turns out? Is it the genes? A mixture of parents' qualities? Or environmental factors? Are we prisoners of our genes? Can everything be blamed on environmental factors? No. We must despite everything take responsibility of our actions. Cannot blame genes, or how things are at home. Cannot blame God. Next, a musical performance. Qur youth vicar Sami... ...and Milla, tutor at the confirmation camp. And the song is called... ...Onanism? You know, Sami... Such free rendition is not ok here. In these parts you don't mock God even if you come from a big city. We'll close with hymn 338, “Day by Day... Afterwards there's coffee at the church hall.

The boy was never found. My theory is, the boy was Homo Lycanthropus. A species thought extinct, commonly known as... ...the werewolf. If my theory is correct, one of the villagers has a secret. The werewolf is back. Theory of evolution states that all species strive to reproduce. Thus passing on their genes. There are probably only a handful of live werewolves in the world. Either they haven't succeeded in reproducing... ...or haven't wanted to. The species is becoming extinct. Is our subject the last werewolf? Markku. He could be called Markku. It's a test subject, not a pet. Markku is a fine name. Markku the ant. We're not naming it after you. Markku the an- You missed the coffee. Do you think we get a stamp for this day? Well yeah I guess. You need a ride? You're not gonna fall? Anselmi. Anselmi. Anselmi. Are you coming? Did you wash your hands? Can't we just leave it? I just wanna say... ...don't make the same mistakes that I did back then. The world is full of temptation. I should know. They said... ...it makes hair grow on your palms. I prayed them not to tell dad. But they did. Bloody hellfire. Anselmi I'm now going to whisk away your sins and demons. Like my father did mine. I baptize you, Anselmi Manuel Vaarakoski... ...in the name of the Father, the Son... ...and the Holy Ghost. Amen. He is now a part of this parish, and we all are responsible... ...in helping him fight the darkness of the world. You think he looks like his father? Are you there? What are you doing? Don't you have anything to say? Slut. My father got a shrapnel in his head, during the war. When I was a little boy. It did some serious damage. Of course we realized it, me and mum. He would get fits for no reason. Usually I got away. But mum didn't. Sometimes she had toothmarks on her neck. Dad didn't really sleep at nights. He'd just doze in the rocking chair. Nightmares woke him up all the time. One night I found him in the shed. He was curled up in a corner, crying. He was holding this. There are more stowed away in the village. He gave me this and made me swear I would save him. I just didn't understand what from. One morning dad was gone. I didn't go save him. I didn't want him back. But I do want to find Eeva. Anselmi I'm now going to whisk away your sins and demons. Like my father did mine. - Anselmi. - Yes? When it rains... When it rains, one wears boots. - Tell me the truth. - About what? About Eeva! Okay. Eeva came by the night she disappeared. But I didn't let her in. - Continue. - That's all I know. I've tried to spare you. Eeva wasn't herself in her final moments. Please let me in. 1 cannot go home. Let me spend the night. I'I tell everyone you're Anselmi's father! That you came to our house and took me like some cheap tramp! That the leader of the parish has a bastard child! And I loved you so much. She left as if possessed. I ran after her. I followed the tracks in the snowfall. Bog holes never freeze up, Eeva knew that full well. I got to the edge. Eeva saw me. Anselmi has to be told. Hey. Hey. Today's session is cancelled, Sampsa's in trouble about that thing. But we'll try next week. Okay. Anselmi. Yes? I've got this place we could go. If you feel like it. Anselmi? Sit down. Close your eyes. Now open. Might you have something you'd want to tell us? Like what? Hey, you can tell us. - Tell you what? - "Tell you what." Come here, I'I show you something. You know what people are like, when it comes down to it? They're like ants. When God offers them a hand... ...What do they do? Well? What do they do? Come on, have a closer look. Sometimes you have to look at something small... ...to understand something big. See? - I don't get it. - Look closer. As close as you can. I know who changed the lyrics. There aren't many printers around. It was a joke. Do you truly repent? Anselmi, are you a sinner? I guess [ am. - Say you're a sinner! - I'm a sinner! Say it! I'm a sinner. Anselmi... - I forgive you. - Gee thanks. Where've you been? I've been waiting whole night through. I wanna know why mum left. Was she ashamed of me? Is there something wrong with me? Wasn't you she was ashamed of. It was me. There's nothing wrong with you. It's me. I should've told you much sooner, but I couldn't. Sit down. I loved your mother very much. It just wasn't enough. The seed didn't take. We had to do something. Your mother couldn't handle the shame. I've had to live with that fact. You must guess what I'm trying to say. I'm not your father. I thought we could visit her grave. They're chiming the bells, it's not time yet. It's an alarm. Asignal agreed on a long time ago. They've been hiding guns and waiting to hear the chimes. - Asignal for what? - To defend the village. Anselmi, are you a sinner? "Anselmi" - Hello? - I've called for a gathering. We need you at the church right now. Who am I talking to? There's no time. The beast is loose, and I know who it is. It must not be allowed to escape. It's killed... Last night happened that which we've all been afraid of. The beast is loose. One of us has been killed. We couldn't protect her. Milla has been killed. We all know the stories about the beast in the marshes. Modern beasts no longer live in marshlands. Modern beasts live among us. They hide in our houses... ...and their blood is mixed with our children's blood. The beast has tasted blood, and it will not stop. Unless we stop him! Anselmi! Aren't these dark clothes hot in the summer? You don't always work after all. "You shall not commit adultery." "If your right eye causes you to sin, pluck it out and cast it from you." "What fruit did you have then in the things..." "...of which you are now ashamed!" “For the wages of sin is death.” - You won't find anything here. - Where is it? It's gone. It might be best to send people home. Tell them Anselmi isn't here. And we can get on with our lives. Yeah... it's probably for the best. Although, how come you are here? I don't... I never said anything about Anselmi. Burn the house. It must not escape. My good men! In the name of the Lord, not like this! There's another one somewhere. Dear Eeva. Only yesterday I heard here is your real grave. At least you'll always have fresh flowers. And a nice blanket during the winter. I was hoping against hope... ...that you'd come hack one day. Anselmi was hoping too. I couldn't raise him as well as you would have. But... We have managed. I've missed you. Dad! Anselmi! Dad, why'd you leave me? There they are! I'm not your dad. You're the only dad I ever had. Dad, they're gonna kill me. Anselmi, I don't know... ...What you've done. But... I do know one thing. Your mother would be proud of you. Now, Anselmi.
