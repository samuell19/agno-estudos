Toboe... Let's go back, Hige. I no longer feel pain. Jaguara's poison is slowly eating away at me. Your kind are wolves who debased themselves by becoming human... ...and were driven out of Paradise. You cannot return to your original form. Mister... Pops... I'm sorry... I... I shot you, so why are you... I promised Blue... ...that I'd protect you. But I couldn't... I'm sorry... I wish I could've stayed at your side like Blue my whole life, looking out for you... I wish we all could have gone to Paradise together... Let me sleep here... That was... Now I get it... That... was you? That was you... Toboe! Toboe! Toboe! You dumb kid... Hey! Hey! What's going on? Where are you guys?! You! So, you're a mere human? I know you have the stone that opens Paradise. What are you waiting for? I have been waiting for a wolf. For you. What? You will soon lose everything, as I have lost everything. You must discard everything that you now possess. That is the law of the new world. The seal is broken. Hurry. Paradise is right under your nose. - Pops! - Toboe! Pops... This can't... How did this happen? Pops... Quent... Why? Why did this have to happen...? Toboe... We have to hurry. He's trying to reach Paradise. He's heading for our Paradise. Isn't that strange? Why doesn't he open up his own Paradise? One for the Nobles? The Tree of All Seeds is over there. The Tree of All Seeds told this one. We have to go. We don't have time to stand around. How about you? What are you going to do? After coming all this way, what are you planning to do? Where are you going to run and hide this time? I'm not running. I just figured that I'm not needed on this journey anymore. That's all I was thinking. None of us is indispensable. Nothing is indispensable. You are. You're the only one who can open Paradise. You're the only one who can go all the way there. Even Tsume must have realized that by now. I'll go. Even if Paradise turns me away, I'll go as far as I can. So you have to come, too. I know you want to go! Stop making excuses! Blue... It's starting to fall apart... Even this close to the center. It looks like we should get a move on, all right. Don't worry about me. When it starts to look like I'll slow you down, I'll take care of it myself. I want to go as far as I can, too. Go on ahead. I want to talk with the runt for a bit. We understand. Hige. I've betrayed you guys before. I'm scared. I might betray you again. No matter what you do to us now, I won't think of it as a betrayal. No matter what it is, I'll just accept it. When I think you're trying to kill me, then I'll fight you. Sure. I'll hold you to that. You know, you've grown pretty big... When I first met you, you were still a scrawny little pup. I knew back then that you loved humans more than anything, but I... No, maybe I never did understand anything. But I... Are you listening, Toboe? You asked me about my scar once, remember? About how I got it. It's the mark of my sin. I abandoned my packmates and ran as they were being killed. And I was run out of the pack. I didn't need any friends. I never trusted them. I always betrayed those around me. Until I met you guys. I wanted to take you to Paradise. You were the one who brought me all this way. C'mon, Tsume! Let's go! I believe in you, Tsume. I won't whine anymore. Yeah, I know. I know. Old man, take care of the runt for me. See ya. Am I the only one who's having trouble breathing? No, so are we. We're pretty high up, that's why. We are almost there. The Tree of All Seeds is waiting up ahead. The Tree of All Seeds has been alive this whole time. It has felt pain all this time. But now, it is breathing freely. Thank you. The crest of House Darcia? That's what this was... This is the Tower of the Seal. It says here that the Nobles built this to seal off the wolves' Paradise. Seal? "The seal is broken"... That's what he said to me. He was starting to turn into a wolf. Darcia, you mean? He had a wolf's eye. When Jaguara's... When the Noble's Paradise started to open, he gave up on going there himself. He's trying to become a wolf. And if he opens Paradise first...? Our kind will have no future. Hey, in that book, how is Paradise described? It doesn't say anything... The last page is blank. Over there. The first mountain. That is the entrance to Paradise. Are you okay? Yeah... I'm sorry. Don't worry about me, go on ahead. I'll take my time as I climb. Just a little more, and you'll reach a spot where you can rest. It's beautiful... Can you see that, Cher? I tell you now the words of the Red Moon. The wolf was born from the Great Spirit, and man became the messenger of the beast. He lives his life in silence, where the blessing of the blood of the gods is bestowed upon him. - Hey! - Hold on! For all my tough talk, I guess I won't be able to make it with you to the end... I guess the area up ahead is a place I won't be able to set foot in. Hang on tight! Stay back! Don't try to come down! I'm not afraid. You wolves will open up the next world for us. I have faith that you will... I didn't need the gun, after all... The flower wins the favor of the lord of the night, and gives off her scent. Firm and eternal in countenance, her form is as a lily-white, supple maiden. She distills and condenses time until all is a precious, frozen mass. It is then that the beast shall appear. Next Time Next Time A journey's end is always a little depressing. A journey's end is always a little depressing. It was a long trip, but now that it's over, it seems like the blink of an eye. Anyway, it's been pretty fun. See ya. If it's meant to be, I hope we meet again.
