Oh baby baby My heart is calling out your name. Every step I take, I remember the places we went I didn't care for you and chased you away. Don't need to care or be with me. I worked all night and finished it this morning. You have nothing to say? Hmm good. Just good? It's better than you filming me picking my nose. But it's just good? If Facebook had a "Love" button, I'd click it a million times. What's up babe? I was just thinking of you. Puan. I showed my mom the clip. She lectured me. How come? She said Why didn't I tell her. Did I get paid for it? Geez. I almost had a heart attack - You scared me. - She thought it's a real MV. You don't have to study anymore. Just do this for a living.

If you don't like it then just click close. Why clicked "Dislike"? These people probably sit at home staring at their shit. I clicked it. Why? Didn't you say you made it Just for me? Yes I did it for you, Milk. Not for anybody else. - So why did you make it public? - Why? Everyone likes it. Only you don't like it. You care more about those 10,000 views than me? It's not like that. What's wrong with you? Of course I care about you more. Or else I wouldn't make it for you. Delete it then. You can't, right? Why do I have to delete it? Uploading photo. Your degree of bliss while in love in retrospect will be the degree of sorrow you feel but multiplied many times. W. Vajiramedhi (Buddhist's quote) Sathu. Did you break up with Puan? No. All his Facebook posts sound like he's dying. - Wimp. - He even posted Buddha quotes. Just click "Like" so he will feel better. Why are you so mad anyway? The MV is nice. Pretty... Ugly you know. I wish I had one. If he didn't love you, he wouldn't have made it. Actually I am not that mad. Just annoyed that he's so cocky. You are just jealous of the 10,000 likes he got. No. Not jealous. You know, I clicked "Like" too. So don't be jealous of me. Oh again? - Grab mine too. - Your name is Milk but you got no milk. And you do? How are you? Still alive? Puan. Why aren't you wearing a shirt? Why are you not wearing clothes? You like this T-shirt? I heard you are a devote Buddhist now? Yeah. 0 Dislikes Okay now? Not really okay. What's wrong now. I'm still hurting. You were mad at me. You're too much. Don't be sad. I will sing a song for you. You know how to play? Yeah. If you're a hill, I will be the tree that holds you tight so you won't be cold. If you're the sky, I will be the white cloud that holds you so you won't be lonely on your own.

Good night, Puan. Hello. Puan, why did you do that? Did what? Posted that damn clip! I played it only for you. Why did you upload it? I am happy you did it for me. So I posted it as a thank you. What did I do wrong? If you want to thank me, Just tell me in person. Or call me. Skype me. Look what I was wearing. It's not proper. Delete it right now. Look Milk, there're only good comments. Beautiful voice. So cute... good voice. Like it a lot. Off beat but who cares. Pretty face. Next time play a Lady Gaga song. Kind of slutty. Oh so hot! Puan, delete it now. - My juices are flowing. - I said delete it now. Puan Are you listening? If you don't delete it, never speak to me again. Puan! Okay Milk. I am deleting it. Video deleted. Milk. Wait. Milk. Wait up. I deleted it. What else do you want? You deleted it doesn't mean the damage isn't done, Puan. So what do you want me to do? Ask all the people in the internet. What if I stop using Facebook, YouTube will you stop being mad at me? Please? Milk. So cute... Asshole! The old clip was deleted. So I reposted the clip I saved to share her cuteness with the world. This will be my last status update. Goodbye. Hello My name is Puan. I'm the one who posted the clip of my girlfriend playing the ukulele "You are the Gift" a few days ago. After I posted the clip there were some comments that I didn't expect and my girlfriend didn't like it. So she told me to delete it. And I did. But there were some people who downloaded the clip and reposted it. So that clip is still on YouTube. I tried to contact the person who posted it but I still can't reach them. I tried to call Milk. But I can't reach her either. She probably doesn't want to talk to me anymore. I made this clip because I want to say sorry to my girlfriend. And I think this is the only way I can. This clip is not meant to be shared because I only want... one person to see it. That one view is Milk, my girlfriend. Milk... I am sorry. It's my fault. You don't have to stop being mad at me. I just want another chance... Just one more. Why are you apologizing to a computer? Why say all this to people on the internet? If I were you, I'd be apologizing in front of her house now. I'm in front of her house now. Thank you everyone. Milk. Milk. I am sorry, Milk. Milk. About the clip. I will track down and delete those remaining ones. My friend is an expert programmer. But if I ever post anything again I will ask you first. Okay? Puan. That's enough. I said sorry about everything but she won't come out. She sent an SMS - "That's enough". What should I do next? No messages. No messages. If you have to ask other people what you should do next I think you don't need to do anything anymore. Just do or post whatever. I'm just 1 person. Without me, you'll be fine. You have tons of people who love you out there. If you're a hill, I will be the tree that holds you tight so you won't be cold. If you're the sky, I will be the white cloud that holds you so you won't be lonely by yourself. If you're a car, the road will be me. If you're the moon, of course I will be the star that stays by your side to keep the cold at bay. Whenever you are sad I will be next to you. Because you are the gift that heaven sent to me. - I will take good care to keep this gift forever. - This looks good. I want to eat watermelon. No one will harm you as long as I am here. I will love you with all my heart. Baby I love you. Baby I love you. - Baby I love you. - Stop it. Stop taking picture. This is our first date after Valentine's day. I want to tell the world that I love Milk! I love Milk! Milk. If you're a car, the road will be me. If you're the moon, of course I will be the star being next to you so you won't be cold. Whenever you are sad I will be next to you. Love ya. If it's not enough. Just replay it again. You took my iPhone? I just want to say the only person who can make me smile is you Milk. I will love you with all my heart. Baby I love you. Come out now. We need to talk. Jon, come out and talk. Jon. Jon. Jon, come out. Jon. Welcome all of you to the Back of House Tour.

You know how hard it was to find you? You wouldn't even come out to see me. I called so many times and you wouldn't pick up. I don't pick up strange numbers. So I'm a stranger now? Why are you here? To get my stuff. Screenplay "Sea You" - Jon. Screenplay "Sea You" - Mam. Have you decided yet? Is it going to be the rich playboy or that lame singer? No closure. Love Triangle. If the old one was good I wouldn't have to find a new guy. Hey! Damn it! Excuse me, it's 9 pm. We are closed. Oh, my friend is in the restroom. Jon. You again? Does your boyfriend mind when you stalk men like this? In my case nobody would dare to. Jon, you haven't answered whether you will be in the movie "Sea You"? Nobody's going to watch this movie. The original was 7 years ago, no one even remembers it. Are you nuts? It's made a 100 million nobody would forget that. I think everyone is waiting for the sequel. Please? Please? Look at me? I don't think you have changed that much. I know why you can't be with anyone. Because you only think about yourself. Jon Suwannamez from Sea You.

I'll do it. Jon, we need to talk to Dir. Ton He's waiting on you. They are going to have a press conference soon. Mam, please go. Let's talk later. Kids did you know that Mr. Jon and I used to be in a movie together? A very popular movie. Raise your hand if you have seen it. If not, it's okay. Because there will be a sequel soon. But you won't get to see it if he doesn't come out of the tank to talk to me. So let's call out his name and clap all together, OK? One two three. Jon Jon Jon Jon Louder Jon Jon Jon Jon Very good. Jon Jon Jon Jon In previous one, it ended with the couple falling in love. This sequel opens with us being a couple fighting and breaking up. Will they get back together again? Stick around to find out in Sea You Again. I remember the synopsis that Ton sent me. Oh shit! I like it. I think the story has matured. There will be no senseless fighting. No revenge. No unpleasantness. It will be all about love and forgiveness. Bitch We can't be in this movie together. What is your reason for not taking the role? Fat? Jon you can lose weight and look good again in no-time. Oh I know, your girlfriend won't let you work with your ex? She's afraid an old flame might reignite? Tell her not to worry. I won't steal you from her. Don't tell me you are still single. Single or not. It won't make a difference. I won't do it. Jon. Didn't you say you love this film so much? Jon. You're still cute. Tomorrow let's go to Ton's office. See you at 10 am. Are you here to cast? I am here to see Dir. Ton. Mr. Ton is not available. He is casting now. For which movie? "Sea You Again" For which part? Casting for the lead actress. For the lead actress, why? Because we still have not casted the leading actress that's why. That's not possible! Are you here to cast or not? If so then fill out the application form. Here is the screenplay to read. I will call you when it's your turn. Jon. The press will ask you about being nominated for Best rising actor. You remember your responses, right? Just stick to the script. OK. Babe. The script is very good, right? No, I won't let you take it. Why not? What the hell kind of movie kissing in every scene! Be reasonable. I am being reasonable. You are being childish. Why? I want to play. - He is very good. An award winning director. - I don't give a damn. Deaw is a lead actor. He's a prick. Don't you know his nickname is Tongue-zilla? So what? You knew and that is why you want that role? That's sick. Is that all you can think about? Mam, we heard that you will be starring with Deaw, is it true? Yes it is. Jon, why are you letting Mam to work with the actor known as "Tongue-zilla"? It's her career. Her lips, her tongue. It has nothing to do with me. Excuse me. One more question please. What's wrong? Why did Jon just walk out? Any problems? Sorry the number you are dialing cannot be connected. Hello. I'm here to cast for "Sea You Again". Thank you. Hey Peak. - Peak. - Noona. OMG. Long time no see. Still slim as always. I've always been slim. Oh my god, miss you lot. How are you? You here to cast too? Yes, I really want this role. I'm sure whoever gets this role will be famous. How come they don't use the same couple? It's been 7 years. Nobody knows where the lead actor is. But I think Their time has passed. The girl is not famous anymore. Now she's just a supporting actress. If she didn't spread her legs so often she wouldn't even make the news. I've never watched this movie yet. What is it about? I was only in 5th grade then. If I remember correctly it's about two strangers who go on a trip together and agreed not to tell each other names. - Oh really? - Yes. What a cool plot! - She sounds easy. - If you really don't know it. Just be quiet. It's about the 2 persons who hate each other but are forced to be together. Can two haters... fall in love? Mam, it's the movie trailer. Come here! The highlight of the Music Festival this year is Zea from "To Die For". Featuring with the boys from F14. "Zea" the Rock star We are "To Die For" "Rang" the Boy band hot steps the least famous amongst all. Two different persons who missed their flight together. - I want to go to the island, how much? - Hey you panda eyes. You sure you really want to go. It's dangerous. Easy for you to say, you are 1 out of the F14 gay boys. If you go missing nobody will even notice. It's dangerous. Don't go. Easy for you to say you are 1 out of the F14 gay boys. If you go missing nobody will even notice. So you think I am gay? Would you like me to show you gay? You. I thought you were dead! I think only the two of us in this island. Why did I get stuck with pathetic guy like you? Oh baby smile and you will be super happy. Don't stop smiling don't stop loving. Oh baby smile and our love will kiss you softly. You will be fine. No more sorrow. Because you have us in your heart. The F14. How can you love me? You hate my guts. All of the songs my band sings, you've never heard of. I just know that when I am with you. I am so damn happy. Is this what they call love? When we get to shore will we hate each other again? The two haters... are going to fall in love. Sea You. Casting for "Sea You Again" - This way. - Ah ha. Your audition went very well. Thank you so much, Ice. - Thanks a lot Ton. I will... - Ton. Why are you holding castings? What about me and Jon? If Jon isn't the lead then you can't be either. But I found Jon already. He is on his way here. Mam, if Jon was interested, he would have been here already. - Umm... I will leave now. - Ton... So... How about hmm... giving me the leading actress role and you cast for the new lead actor. OK? You don't have to cast for the lead actress. Mam. You don't get it, do you? You and Jon are the starring couple. Either you star together or you don't. Do you understand? Have you watched "Full House"? They are going to have a sequel. Without Rain, then who would Song Hye-Kyo star with? Will she star with jang Geun-Suk? Jang Geun-Suk and Song Hye-Kyo? That won't work. You know what I meant? You are watching the Ocean Walker show Anybody who is interested in a underwater walk please contact our staff. The next story is what we've all been waiting for... about the movie "Sea You Again". That's right. After an exhausting search for a starring couple waiting on who that couple would be... Finally, the next 100 Million Baht box office film has got its new leading stars. They are Peach Pachara and Ice Preechaya. As the new starring couple. The director said that The reason for changing the main cast is to keep the story fresh. The script was also updated to make it appeal younger. Cut! Get ready for the next scene. Hurry up. Before the sun goes down. Cut. I said cut! I thought I was going to die down there. I won't let anything happen to you. Really? Here. Hey. After we finish filming what will you do? I will go back to finish my marine biology degree. You? I will do more casting calls. More? You like being a star? It's my life. It makes me very happy. Especially when people love and admire me. It feels very nice. You don't like being a star? I don't like acting. So why did you accept this movie? Because of you. After filming is done will we still get to see each other? Of course. Couples are supposed to see each other everyday. How could they? Unbelievable. "Sea You Again" how can it be without us, Jon? I think we still have time. It's not too late. Ton should give us a chance. Let me be straight. This movie is my last chance. I want to be a star again. Your lines start here. The highlighted ones are mine. This scene is where the couple broke up... and here's where they meet again. Let's pretend we are both stranded on an island together and we are surrounded by fish swimming all around us. Ready? Okay. Action! How long has it been since we've seen each other? Since the concert last year. When you wrote that song cursing me and sang it on stage. You only remember all the bad, huh? Was there anything good to remember? I am sorry. I am sorry for acting like a fool and making you sad. But you were like that because of me too. So how have you been? All right. Not having you to nag me about waking up late my messy clothes on the floor not eating on time and not putting lotion on before bed. I'm doing fine. You think of those things too? You don't? No. Because I never felt like you were gone. Rang. Do you think we can love each other again? Zea: Do you think we can love each other again? In the script... Rang has to kiss Zea. Rang bends down to kiss Zea. They both have tears of happiness. Cut! Action! Cut! Gosh... can you kiss like two people really in love? If you guys still can't kiss, I will show you how to do it. Jon. I am begging. Please focus. - Please get it right. - Now try looking at each other. Stare into each other's eyes. Yes like that. Now try to imagine Zea and Rang what they have gone through together. Their connection and how they will never get to see each other again. Action! Jon. Try thinking about Rang and Zea. Think about how much they're in love. How much fighting they did until they had to break up. Think of how they felt to be alone. It must have been lonely. Now... they run into each other again. How long has it been since we've seen each other? Well... Since the concert last year. When you wrote that song cursing me and sang it on stage. You only remember all the bad, huh? Was there anything good to remember? I am sorry. I am sorry I made you sad. I am such an idiot. Why did I have to be so damn jealous? That was bad for us. I've blamed myself every day. Why did I have to be such an asshole. I am sorry. But you did all that because of me too. I am sorry. How have you been? All right. Not having you to nag me about waking up late my messy clothes on the floor not eating on time and not putting lotion on before bed. I'm doing fine. You think of those things too? You don't? Not at all. Because I never felt like you were gone. Do you think we can love each other again? Do you think we can love each other again? Fantastic. You've made Rang and Zea characters come to life again. But... you haven't been watching the news at all, right? That was the end of the Dive Communication Show. Please give a round of applause to Mr. Jon. Any questions? Jon. You already knew they've changed the leading cast, right? You knew I wouldn't get the part? You knew and why did you rehearse the script with me? Answer me! Is something wrong with the mic? Sorry jim. Jon. Jon. Do I make you nervous? No. You've never had a girlfriend? Then you've never hugged a girl before? I met you... got to know you... loved you... You slut! Fought with you... broke up with you... hated you... all because of this movie. The reason I don't want to be in this movie because I don't want to fall in love with you again. I understand. I am glad that I got to share that moment with you again. Thank you Jon. Mam! Do you think we can love each other again? Do you think... - we can love each other again? - Jon... Isn't that supposed to be my line?

Everybody in the back let me hear some noise! Up until now this woman can't find a reason for running in a 42. 195 km. At 3 am. She can't make sense of it. If not for that fateful day. 4 months ago... What's the matter with you? Didn't you see me? What were you looking at? Hey... Your arm. Hey! Who do you think you are? Do you have a spare of glasses? Let's go to my car? You got glasses in your car? I got Betadine. Ouch! Where do you think you're going? Ouch! "Sea You Again". If there wasn't any sound of the rain that evening inside his car would have been totally silent. Why do you go there to run? The traffic is bad. If I run on the road, people will think I am a boxer. Excuse me Is this the reason why you're running a marathon? She is thinking there must be a problem that caused anyone to run a marathon. How far is a marathon? It's like from Bangkok to Pathum Thani. Pathum Thani km. 3 or km. 6? What do you think about while you're running? But running alone and speaking to no one is fun, right? About your glasses I will buy a new one for you. Forget it. How would you know my prescription? And how are we going to meet again? At that second who knows what set her heart in motion? The Betadine, the rain, the smell of his sweat in the car or maybe it's the blurry image of him caused by her bad eyesight. You run here everyday? If I were a dog I'd have pissed on every light pole. How am I going to know who you are? Sorry. Wait. I still don't know your name. I haven't told you? I haven't asked yet. Don't worry about the glasses. - Huh? - I don't need it. Thank you very much. Hey you... She thought he's the type of person she'd like to spend time with even when she wanted to be alone. Hey you. Hey. This is for the shoes I broke. It's more expensive than your glasses. How would you know? It's nice. And how would you know it is nice? I just think so. You don't have to say that to make me feel good. Here. If you can make me run 5 km it would help improve my golf game. Do you have free time? Heaps. It means I have a lot of time. I see. What year were you born? What year? Ah ha. Hey. Even though we are not competing with anyone we shouldn't let grandpa over take us. Aren't you embarrassed? Can we not run the opposite way? There is no rule that say we can't. Still! Year of dog, pig, rat, cow, tiger, rabbit, big snake. Gosh 24? Let's try walking together like fast walking? Let me ask you something. The day you ran into me you really didn't see me? What were you looking at? Runners only focus on what is 7 feet ahead. And we just keep running. See what happens if you only look at the ground. Asthma motivates you to run? Oh... When I was born the doctor told my parents not to let me play any sports. Just let me take it easy. So I always thought is this really how my life is going to be? Just sitting around? You know I run because it's a sport that I can do alone, in private. Whom are you hiding from? Don't laugh at me. Actually that day I didn't mean to run the opposite way but I saw my grandma's friend doing the Tai Chi here. Your grandma's friend? She's notorious for reporting back to my family. You know. Even my running clothes I have to get washed outside. Oh my goodness. You know I really like Pid the bass player of Bodyslam. He is very strong. While he is holding a big bass guitar he can lift his leg over an amplifier as tall as my head. - Really? - Watch this. Cool right? He told her that Marathon is a world that nobody around him understands. It's like a secret garden where only he can enter. At least every year I have a goal for myself. That's interesting. Do you think I can run a marathon? Why don't you try? While they were walking and talking his touch was like the tender peel covering the orange in her hand. Wait. Can I ask you again about the roses? It has nothing to do with being broken hearted, right? If I send you an email will you reply me? Then they both walked away with a new feeling that pulled at their hearts. That night he emailed her the marathon running schedule of jeff Galloway. Inside it listed the distance that keeps increasing every week until the day of the marathon. It meant the marathon she had no confidence in or ever dreamed of being in was about to become reality. Have fun and enjoy your first marathon. Enjoy it or not I wouldn't know. But the fact that she came out to run with him for months probably meant she wanted to do something with her life. Whatever it is that she was not sure would be possible. Hey, you. Hurry up. Faster. Come on. - You must try harder. - I can't anymore. - On that day you must run for 4-5 hours. - You go first. Today I can't. - You are already 3 weeks behind schedule. - just go. I can't today. Just a bit more. You can do it. Just go. I really can't. - Hurry. - just go. You go first. I can't take it anymore. No way I can make it. Seriously. I better quit. I think you should stop thinking negatively. No matter how tired you are. Tomorrow is a new day. That's for sure. Everybody will have a new day. But marathon is not for everybody. I wasn't born with 8 nostrils. No matter how difficult it is our body will adjust. If you don't push yourself a bit more or try a bit harder you will never move forward in your life. Go! No! Why do I have to run this stupid marathon and make myself suffer Just to overcome asthma like you? Did you think running was going to be easy? You don't have to pressure yourself to do something you don't want to. I want to run but I don't want to be tired. Up to you. If you want to run, 1 km is enough. But if you want life changing then you run a marathon. The moment happened very fast. She thought he must be mad. Because he said the word... "Up to you" She was in shock staring at his back while he was walking away. She wanted to say sorry to him. But she was afraid he might turn around and say "Sorry for what? I am not your boyfriend." And that would make her sadder since this would reminded her that Forget about girlfriend I can't even be your friend. Luckily the thing she was afraid of didn't really happen. Well I... had a bad experience at the 35km and that has to do with the dried roses in my car. That morning of the race I bought those roses and kept them in my car. I wanted to see them when I drove home. I wanted to celebrate proving the doctor's words were wrong. He told her that last year was his first marathon. I went without preparing myself. Never researched anything. Trained only for a week. Didn't drink or eat before the race. I only thought about keeping my pace so I could finish as soon as possible. At around 30km. I passed out. I was running but at a walking pace. I ran even though I felt a knife in my back. Then there was the voice of the devil from afar "Who told you to run anyway?" He could only run for another 3 km. At 35 km the sound of the devil in his head which everyone told him to ignore started up again like clockwork. "Hey what the hell are you doing here?" His knee lead his leg one after the other in slow motion. Then suddenly his legs got weak as if there was a chain attached to his leg. And then I answered the devil. You're right. And? Mr. Mr. And I was DNF. Huh? Did Not Finish I mean they put me on a stretcher. I put those roses inside the glove compartment. And planned not to open it until I ran 42 km. Until I carelessly opened it. I am sorry. Hey, you know. On the day of the race at 28km we will see the sunrise beyond the Rama VIII bridge. Really cool. At this moment if anyone is picturing this will also think of a musical score playing along that is very inspirational. Give me your hand and we will run together. No need to be afraid I will run with you. Give me your hand and we will run together. No need to be afraid I will run with you. The dust on your shoes will let the world know who you are. Give me your hand and we will run together. No need to be afraid I will run with you. The dust on your shoes will let the world know who you are. In Buddhism, everything in this world moves in a constant flux until it encounters a turning point or outside force. And this story of hers was no exception. Mr. Pongsakorn Thipthinnakorn. Once we run for 2-3 months, we will feel we aren't the same persons anymore. Did she hear that phrase? "We aren't the same persons anymore" It's the same phrase that her husband whispered in her ear while giving her the wedding ring. "We aren't the same persons anymore" Many months past. She never spoken about her husband's death. Not even once. Even though she still remembers everything about the day he passed away. Breaking news, a plane broke apart into 2 pieces. The front of the plane hit the sand wall. The tail of the plane is stuck on the runway. The time, the place, the hands of her friend on her shoulder and even the lights seemed to focus on her more intensely that evening. Sis... Sis... Sis... This is Sairoong, her young colleague who became her best friend. You got darker. All the stuff on your desk are with me. Are you coming back to work? You? Run a marathon? Still at the same condo? You don't pick up your cell anymore? And how come you didn't join the dinner last time? I was busy. I wanted to go though. But... I can't remember why. - Never mind. - Next time. - You okay, sis? - I am very okay. Really okay. Sairoong knows her very well. Are you afraid of someone coming that way? You look that way every 15 seconds. So is the rumor of you running with a young guy everyday true? The rumor that Sairoong heard about was missing one point. Besides being young he's also good looking too. Since when? What? Did you decide to start seeing that boy? I knew that you would say this because if I were you I would say the same thing. So what was all the drama about 5 months ago for only love one man in your life? I never forgot my late husband. It's true that there is a new man in my life. She told Sairoong about him and the stories that he told her about the running schedule, the Milo's principle and the devil at the 35 km. Before Lumpini park was closed that night, Sairoong asked her. Sis... You sure you aren't going crazy? I understand you must be lonely, but... I am lonely but I don't want to be sad. She wasn't sure Sairoong would accept her or not if she told her the real reason in her mind. I can't accept this, sis. That night she lay on the sofa and stared at the faint light shining through the curtains like in the Kazakhstan films with a heavy heart. Hello Pongsakorn speaking. Please leave a message after this beep beep beep sound. Thank you. Hello honey, did you decide? I am done with work. See I told you it would only take a day. You always exaggerate things. I told you so and you didn't believe me. The beach here is very beautiful. Why don't show me how you dive in the pool here? I've showed many times. You must be bored already. This week is really busy. I've been working non-stop, really tired, lazy too. You should change your flight and come back now. Hello. This is Pongsakorn speaking. Please leave the message after this beep beep beep sound. Thank you. Don't come back. Don't come back. Are you sick? I am downstairs. I am going up to see you. Hey did you receive my messages? She spoke to him trying to control in a low voice so that it would not echo. But at that moment she couldn't control her voice not to stutter. If I want to keep seeing you I will go running with you. But honestly this has gone too far. You shouldn't waste your time on me. Do you want everyone to feel sorry for you? Why? You know Milo's principle. You planned a 40 km running schedule but something as simple as this you have to ask? These last couple of months I've been trying to tell you I like you. Your family wouldn't be able to accept this. No family would give their blessing. My family can't accept about a marathon either. In 20 years you want to spoon feed me Anmum before bed? If you want to have dinner go eat with your mom at home. You don't want to regret it later, right? Do you regret anything now? Your devil at the 35 and 36 km didn't warn you about what you are doing now? My husband just died early this year. I know. It was on the newspapers. The day you ran into me why did you ask for my name then? I wanted you to think I didn't know anything about you. What if... I was a normal guy and you were a normal woman. And you had no husband. Could we be together? What makes you think we could? My instincts. Either you watch too many movies, or you are too young. I am young, but not that young. I'm sorry I am not amused by your teenage quip. Right before you came to see me I was looking at myself in the mirror. It was the first time in the 2-3 months that I took a good look at myself. I never felt I betrayed my husband until today. Do you know what did I promise in front of his grave? I promised I would never have anyone else. Thank you for introducing me to marathons. But I don't want to see your face anymore. That was an amazing story. That group of teenagers who were fighting are very lucky that the bullet fired from the gun struck and killed only a crocodile. After that day She thought about starting her life over. But all she could do is to turn on the TV and pretend to watch Sairoong's show. Or turn her back towards Lumpini Park while the BTS train approached Saladang station. On a sunny day, she thought of retiring her shoes. Just like those retired football players do when they stop using their studs. It was a Saturday morning in October Her mom came to visit with stuff to give her from China. Her mom asked her about work. When are you going back to work? In a while. And then made breakfast for her. Even though she didn't make it obvious there was a lot of little things that made her feel her mom wanted to talk to her about something. Mom. Did Sairoong tell you? Yesterday. I met her and she told me. She couldn't think of anything to say to her mom. She told me you're going to run a marathon. Be careful not to break your leg. On my way up, someone asked me to give this to you. I guess he tried to call but your phone must be off. Tomorrow morning, I hope you will enjoy your first marathon. This time, he really made her heart skip a beat. Taste it. Okay. And who's that guy? Kids these day are so good looking, huh? Your trainer? Good so he can look after you. While her mom was cooking that morning food was the last thing on her mind. The past couple months practicing for the marathon gave her peace. Living life seemed to get easier. But right now she was afraid if she stayed in this room she would just stare in the mirror over and over again. I want my new life to begin with the sound of the gun going off. I don't want to just run. I want a new start on life. I'm sure. I want my car to have the smell of my sweat too. I saw the sunrise at the Rama VIII Bridge. If I didn't run, I wouldn't have seen the sunrise like that. Keep going! Almost to the finish line. I want to confront my devil at 35 km. I want to confront my devil at 35 km. I want to confront my devil at 35 km. We have reached the point of the race where we all feel alone and must decide. And ask ourselves "How badly do we want to finish?" Miss? Do you need a ride? And we must find the answer on our own. - What kilometer is this? - I don't know either. She never thought She would end up at Phra Sumeru Road at the age of 42. Thank you. Miss, just a bit further. You still haven't stopped running opposite everybody else. What took you so long? I was waiting for you at the finish line for a long time. Yesterday you told my mom that you will look after me? Well... Not exactly like that. What did my mom say to you then? - She said... - I am just kidding. Let's go! She was thinking, in reality her past and memories do not exist. Right now it was just a matter of moving her legs to keep moving forward. Hey you go first. Go with me. Hurry up. just a bit more. You go first. Stop talking negatively, come on. Only 2 more km. How hard could it be! Tomorrow is new day. Remember? Give me your hand. I already bought the roses. Let's go! If there was no pain to overcome why would anyone want to run a marathon? They both ran for 6 hours. Slower than the fastest runner by 3.5 hours. The finish line is there for all the runners. No matter if you are the 1 st or the 1,500th runner everyone who crosses the finish line will be treated as a winner. So how did you answer your devil at the 35km? She knew now no matter what she told the devil she was not the same person anymore. And this is what she's realized of how a person should live life. Keep moving forward to pass the 7 feet in front of you so you can look forward to the changes coming in the next 7 feet ahead. "There's more to come in just 7 feet so don't leave just yet!"
