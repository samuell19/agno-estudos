MADADAYO He's coming. Attention. Bow. Be seated. Someone's been smoking. No smoking in the classroom. Still... it is difficult to resist the urge. l, too, am no exception. When l hear the bell in the faculty room, l try to leave... But then l get the urge to smoke. l light cigarette. Soon l light another,... then another. So you see, l am always 20 or 30 minutes late. But, Professor, what's with you today? lt is already 30 odd years... since l've been addressed as ''Professor''. During that time... as if watching water running from an open faucet... onto a dirt floor and into a ditch... students have drifted away in front of my eyes. lt is impossible to remember each and every face. Ah, yes. That l remember clearly to this day. The face belongs to one... who slept during class with his eyes open. Hey, Takayama. Yes. That dozing expert was your father. By the way, gentlemen. Today is the last day for me to be called ''Professor''. As of today... l am resigning my professorship. My books... have somehow become salable. l can live by writing. l must admit l do not dislike teaching... but as the proverb...''He who runs after two hares will catch neither''... l have decided to quit teaching. Professor. Even if you quit... you are our professor. My father, too, was an alumnus of this school. So were his friends. Even to this day,... they call you professor. They also say you are solid gold. Solid gold? A lump of gold with no impurities. lt means you are the true. You are the German professor,... but you have taught us more. l feel you have taught us many precious things. TOKYO, 1943. This is the house our professor moved into... after he quit school. Ma'am, put the professor away somewhere. He's in the way. Darling. Put that in the entrance hall. The entrance hall will be my study. At the same time, l will be the gatekeeper... to protect the house from invasion... by a motley crowd like you. RECElVlNG DAYS: 1ST AND 15TH OF THE MONTH VlSlTORS ON OTHER DAYS PROHlBlTED l hope it is all right. What is? This house. The rent is cheaper than l expected. l knew there was something fishy. When l went to order noodles today,... the shop lady told me... this house has been burglarized quite frequently. So none have settled down very long. And it was vacant for a while. The heck with burglars. There's nothing worth stealing here. Still... l'm somehow scared. Don't worry. No burglar will break in. Definitely won't. Since l was a child... l've been so afraid of burglars. l've given much thought on how to prevent burglars. And l have hammered out a method to prevent them. Did you really, professor? Yes, l did. One o'clock. Bewitching hour. Hour for the burglars. l'll go over this wall and open the side door. Sneak in here. Wait a minute. Aren't we acting like burglars? We became worried about what madam told us. We're here to examine the precautionary measures. The only way to check is to sneak in like real burglars. Take a look at that. What a plight! ''Don't worry'', he said. Didn't he boast on being an expert on burglars? BURGLAR'S ENTRANCE BURGLAR'S PASSAGE BURGLAR'S RECESS AREA BURGLAR'S EXlT That was a clean score. l had to steal this to get even. lsn't that the professor's hat? l heard he wore this when he was an instructor in the army. He shouldn't need this anymore. As a reminder of this day... What'll we do about the side door? What about it? lt's unlocked. lt has to be locked. You'd better go over the wall. lt's unsafe. You're right. lt's good. Come down. Come down. -What is it? -Someone's coming. Darn it! lt's a cop! Can we leave the side door like that? Sure. With those signs, nothing will be stolen. Our professor is something. Yes, he's solid gold. Professor! We have happily come upon receiving your invitation. Come right on in. We can't with you sitting there. You look like a scribe or a fortune-teller. Literary men somewhat are the same. This must be a defense measure to keep away the visitors. Besides, who wants to stay if he's reading this kind of thing? BY SHOKUSANJlN (Haiku poet) ''Annoyance is to have visitors... ''Nonetheless, this does not imply you'' ''By the host. ''Delight is to have visitors. ''Nonetheless, this does not imply you''. There aren't enough cushions... so l'll be the one to use it. l think that's rude to the guests. But, oh, well. What do you mean rude? You barge into my house,... remove all the sliding doors... Fine guests you are. Professor, it's not a visiting day. What's happening today? lt's a special day today. A special day? lt's the day l have become a genuine old man. lt is my 60th birthday. l have become 60 years old. l that true? lf we had known that... we would have invited you to a great banquet. Come, come. Don't say that. lt's wartime now. Not a time for a grand celebration. l myself had completely forgotten... if not for some venison my relatives back home sent me. l thought it was a good idea... to exchange drinks with you over some venison. We brought beer and sake we've gathered. l appreciate that. By the way, how many of you are here? There are 16, sir. Do we have enough cooking stoves and pans? lf we don't, we'll go buy some. Gentlemen. Happy birthday, sir. Make yourselves at home. l sit this way because it is comfortable for me. Please put the meat in? Ma'am. Ma'am, join us. Don't worry. She can't... she's never eaten horse meat. Horse meat, sir? lsn't this venison? We received a bulk of venison... more than we two can eat. So l decided to invite you. But considering your appetite... l realize it was slender bulk. Venison stew is rare and grand... but adding horse meat should make an interesting blend. ''Horse'' and ''deer'' mean stupid. l get it, sir. This means we are stupid. No need to be depressed. Beef, pork, and chicken are hard to come by nowadays. l happened to hear horse meat was available. l struck upon the elegance... of adding horse meat to the venison stew. l set out to a butcher's quite a distance from here... and bought the horse meat. Should bring tears to your eyes. For his loving students... an old man whipping his old bones to buy horse meat. Can you imagine that? lt's a typical, ''Looking up to our teacher,... ''thinking of our debt to our teacher''. Gentlemen! What is more, l found myself... in an awkward situation at the butcher's. The horse was... a familiar horse at the Army Academy... where l taught for some time. lt stared at me with dubious eyes, as if saying... ''What in the world are you buying there, sir?'' l was so embarrassed. l wanted to hide somewhere. l never realized horses had such large eyes. Well, let's eat. The meat should be ready. You certainly make it easy for us to eat... with that story of yours, professor. lmagine it's all venison. Besides, the two meats are mixed. You wouldn't know which is which. Bon appetit! lt's good. lt's certainly delicious. lf there is an air raid,... this ''stupid stew''... will turn into ''blind stew''. l hate air raids. l have to turn off the lights. l've been afraid of the dark since l was a child. l can't sleep in the dark, either. Even now, sir? Aren't you afraid of the dark? Of course not. We're grownups. What's so scary about darkness? You gentlemen are impossible. Why is that? Anyone unafraid of darkness... has a vital defect as a human being. You lack imagination. A proper human being... conceives the existence of something... in their imagination in darkness which prevents you from seeing. Whatever is in the dark... it may be of danger to you. That's why we become scared. This is justified logic. ln my case... if l hear there are badgers here... everyone in the neighborhood seems like badgers. Rather, l suspect... the badgers have disguised them selves as humans. This is only natural for a proper human being. lt may be natural for you... because you are solid gold. To the solid gold professor! Cheers! Cheers! Looking up to our teacher Thinking of our debt to our teacher Over the garden of teaching. Countless years have already passed So lost is the passage of time The years and the months... Our professor's house... was also burned down from the air raids. This is the professor's house after that... All won't go in. Thanks for coming. -Ok here? -Over here. Professor should love this. Thank you for your consideration. Can l put the bag there? -Are you coming in? -l'll help. There are too many people. -Are you all right? -l can't budge. l now know how canned sardines feel. -Anything to put over here? -This, please. -Please. Yes, thank you. -This, too. Watch your head. lgnore that head. Would you take this, too? Ma'am, if you need anything,... please tell us. Tank you very much, everyone. We trouble you all the time. Don't mention it. l want an umbrella. Take this one, sir. Our bathroom is... that new building over there. lt doesn't have a roof. Therefore, on rainy days such as today... we can't use it. What do you say, guys? To be honest, this place is terrible. Let's find someplace else. No, no. Coming across this house... which miraculously survived was mere luck. Besides, the owner is a baron l'm acquainted with. -A baron? -Peerage. Lived in this house? Don't talk nonsense. This was... the shack for the baron's old garden keeper. On the morning when both the baron's house... and ours were burnt down... l met the baron who came to look around his estate. My wife and l found this shack and were resting here. l asked him if we could rent it. He said, ''please, go ahead''. We were very luck, indeed. You know this, don't you? HOJO-Kl Yes, sir. Books are heavy. l fled with only this book, my favorite. The author of this book,... Kamono Chomei... lived in the capital during the Heian Era. He experienced many calamities... such as war, fire and famine. Losing all hope in life... he secluded himself in a mountain hermitage. l recently feel the same way... as Kamono Chomei must have felt. For the time being, l intend to settle down here... which resembles the hermitage he lived in. Well, gentlemen, l wish l can invite you in... but l'm afraid l can't. lt's packed with my wife and l alone. Don't worry. Professor. Please. Many of the birds we kept were burnt. My wife insisted on freeing them from the cages... if we couldn't take them. A bird freed from its cage at night... would only fly into the fire. lf they are going to be burnt anyway... they might as well meet their fate in their familiar cages. We left them. A neighborhood child... found this silver-eye and gave it to us. l must have fallen out of its nest. lt was just a tiny fledgling at first. Since she raised it from that time... my wife strongly insisted... and didn't let the cage go. We had no choice but to flee with only this. The only resemblance... this has with the hermitage in'' Hojo-Ki''... is its smallness, but without the elegance. There is no sound of clear water from the mountains... running from bamboo pipes as at Chomei's hermitage. The only sound of water here... is that of someone urinating against the clay wall. l wonder why... people take the trouble... of always urinating in the same place. They all do it there. The ''Urinating Forbidden'' sign has no effect. Even a picture of a shrine seems insufficient. But l came up with a brilliant idea. l painted a special incantation. l'm sure it works this time. Go take a look at it. lt's on the other side. lt's ingenious. URlNATlNG FORBlDDEN Clever indeed. Can't afford to get it chopped off. He's certainly a genius for such things. The rainy season may end. Yes. By the way, how is the professor? Where's the professor? You see how it is. He's hopeless once it begins to rumble. That's why l must keep ready this incense against thunder. lt may not be proper to say this... after all you've done, but... human beings accumulate so many things during their life. The burden lightened ... with everything burnt in the air raid. But things have increased in this house again. l sometimes hope the B-29 will come pay us a visit. Still. We're glad the war is over. Are you sure? Since the war,... life has become worse. During the war, we at least had food rations. Without rations... we are reduced to live like beggars. Long ago, when l was a small child... we used to make a hut... with bamboo and straw... in the open lot behind our house. l took delight in sitting in it. When my grandmother caught me there... she shed tears and said. ''What in the world is this boy doing? He will surely grow up to be a beggar''. She wept like a child. lndeed, my grandmother's prophecy came true. Professor! What are you saying? You fancy yourself as Chomei? Did you forget his spirit? lt's not like you. ''The river runs on and on and the water is never the same. Bubbles floating on stagnant water disappear and form... they never remain forever. ln this world, one's habitat... has come to pass as trus''. l see. Think it no more than an old man's grumbling. Let me apologize. We are here about that matter, sir. We can't have you living here forever. We plan to build a house for you somewhere. Nonsense. l won't let you. Not immediately, sir. By the first Maadha kai next year... we'll have a concrete plan. What is this? This Maadha kai? The name of your birthday. We've decided on that since it's not likely you'd die soon. (ready?.) (not yet. (not yet? ''Maadha kai'' as in this. The characters are Ma from ''a God's name''... and A and Da from ''the Buddha''. lsn't that a great name? ls that right? Not yet? Not yet? l'm back. lt's a genuine Johnny Walker bottle... but the content is different. lt's medical alcohol. l got it from a doctor l know. He made it by mixing tea and brown sugar. The taste is questionable, but it's effective. l must say, l'm beginning to feel good. Professor. When we were students, we often drank with you. When we got drunk, you led us to a lot of mischief. We switched nameplates on houses. When you sobered up, you'd make us put them back again. So sorry, sir. Professor. Do you want your new house Japanese or Western style? As l already said, l won't let you. Leave it to us, Professor. Now that the war is over, major publishers are reopening. One of them has offered to pay in advance for the right... to publish your works. Leave it to us. There is a piece of land we are considering now. We can build a small garden. What kind would you like? l'd like to have a pond. A pond? A garden pond? There won't be space for a big pond... but a small one will be possible. l don't want such a small one. l'd like to keep some fish... but fish swim in the same direction. lf the pond is so small... they'd have to bend their bodies all the time. lt'll be pathetic if their backs get bent. Fish's backs? What about this idea? The whole garden is a pond. That's a lot of construction work. Then... make the pond circumference as large as possible. Build an island in the middle. Make a doughnut shaped pond. You come up with the weirdest ideas. You're beyond us mediocre men. He seriously worries about fish's backs. l must say, he's a genius. He's a child. He never grows up. l got it. That's what turns you on. Don't be silly. Don't hide it. l realize... that's what we like in him, too. That's why it's fun to be with him. lsn't that right? The moon is out. The moon is out, the moon is out Round, round, perfectly round l love old songs. Like Henri Rousseau' paintings... so innocent and honest.. l love songs of the good ol' days. During the war... we had forgotten about such nice things like the moon. The moon is out, the moon is out Round, round, perfectly round The moon is like a tray ''The houses demolished under frequent fires... ''are incalculable. ''Alone the trivial hermitage remains tranquil... without dread. ''Though small and poor... it offers a bed at night... and a seat the day. ''What more can one ask for in a shelter''? THE FlRST MAADHA KAl To celebrate our professor's 61st birthday... we will open the first Maadha kai party. Under the allied occupation... food and alcohol are not easy to come by. Luckily, with the cooperation of all the members... we were able to hold this banquet. As the chairman. let me voice our appreciation... to the officers who have done so well. Words from our professor... and a large glass of beer. Please drink up in one breath. Then a toast in his honor. My friends and gentleman. Thank you all for inviting me here tonight. Thank you for sparing time... though some are not busy... from your busy schedule... to attend this wonderful gathering. ''ls this old goat still alive?'' seems to be motives of... the Maadha kai and that you all have... the desire to ask me Maadha kai (not yet?)... l have come to say Madadayo (not yet). Though it may be against the principles... of this meeting, ask me again next year and the year after. Please ask me Maadha kai. (not yet). l promise that l will someday... respond to you by saying Mouiiyo (l'm ready). l assure you l am well-prepared. The person to my right... has taken care of me for years. He is my physician, Dr. Kobayashi. He will sign my death certificate. The gentleman on my left... is one of the alumni. He took over his family business... and is now a priest at a temple. Rev. Kameyama will... perform the final ritual before l die. ln any case... l am about to empty this large... glass of beer in one breath... And even if l die on the spot... there is nothing to worry about. Madadayo (not yet Cheers! Gongratulations. Gentlemen, while you are still free... from the effects of the liquor... a short speech from the each of you. Make them short and simple. Long live the professor! That was too short. lt's felicitating. A long one'll be a condolence. l am deeply grateful to the professor. When we staged the opera ''Faust'' in German under his guidance... l was given a wonderful role. l will always treasure that memory of sensation. Did you play Mephistopheles? No, sir. l played the eternal virgin Faust fell in love with... Margarita. l'm awkward with speeches, so... l'll recite all the station names from Hokkaido to Kyushu. Express trains? No, for the locals. That 'll be something. Kushiro, Shin-Fuji, Ohtanoshige, Shoro, Shiranuka, Onbetsu... Let's forget him. Next. l don't understand why today is an auspicious day. Probably because professor is still alive. l'm alive, too, but there's... l don't it's auspicious. Say, your holiness! You embarrass me. Then, Eminence! That, too. Then, Priest! That's better. How's your business? Are you busy? Quite busy, thank you. That's why l don't want you to come yet. Then l shall have to wait. By the way, Mr. Quack. Candidly speaking... how long would you say can l hold out? Let me see. Granted you keep to my advice... l'll guarantee another 15-16 years. That's bad. lf he lives so long, we officers will be accused. Drink up, professor. You're a juyaku (executive), aren't you? Yes, thank you, sir. Have you ever thought of the word ''executive''? Not particularly, sir. That's the trouble. Comes from ''execute''... ''enforce,'' ''discharge''... even ''behead''. You mustn't be vain just because you became an executive. Such a person is not worthy. Must be executed. Now that my turn has come... l would like to... l owe it all to professor... thank you, professor. Professor, you have taught us the joy of drinking. But some only got drunk and had given you trouble. Sugino went wild swinging beer bottles. When Kitamura got drunk, he'd hug and kiss anyone. Professor! Shaved off your beard? Yes, l did. Mustn't do such a thing... without telling us. Why, sir? The beard was a part of your face for many years. We all recognized you... because of that beard. Now it's gone... l didn't recognize you at first. Granted, the beard was yours, but... it was also ours, so... mustn't shave it off on your own. Sorry, l'll grow it again. That won't do. lf you grow it again... we won't recognize you. Muito obrigado! As you all know... professor is indeed-read. One time... he told us not to take for granted... that ears are attached to the head. because Ampriobiris spirias has ears on its feet. What's Ampriobirisus spirias? What is that? lt's Ampriobiris spirias. Please, sir. Gentlemen. Don't crowd me like this. l can't cope with you all by myself. Let's toast once again... and we all enjoy the occasion as we like. Gentlemen. Thank you. Congratulations. Thank you. Drinking parties are interesting. At one time, all the members become intoxicated. lt somehow reminds me of... water in a pot coming to a boil. That is why... l still feel l am his student. The professor is great. That's right. Not that professors are great... but a great man became a professor. Professor is like the sun to us. Overstatement. That would be an exaggeration... so l'll say he's like the moon. Overstatement. Wait. There are half moons. Or one-third moons. Or at times no moons. Likes professor's lessons. This is why l compare him to the moon. The moon is great The moon is the sun's sister The moon turns into a perfect circle The moon turns into a bow Spring, summer, autumn, winter She shines over entire Japan The moon is out, the moon is out Round, round, perfectly round The moon is like a tray The moon is hiding, hiding Behind black, black,jet black Clouds like black ink The moon is out once again Round, round, perfectly, round The moon is like a tray Gentlemen. Remember...''One-two Mr. Pharmacist''. Let's do that. One-two Medicine is the best in Japan One two Buy One-two medicine One, two, one two The medicine cures... One, two Pyrosis, stomach trouble, diarrhea Dizziness before and after childbirth Asthma, headache, influenza From here, is my original. Take the pace. Medicine can cure numerous illnesses But no medicine can cure a fool Foolishness is in heaps today Japan is blooming with fools now Suffer defeat, held under occupation But fools call it the end of the war Right about! Advocating democracy loud and clear Only crooks throw their weight about Bribery and corruption currently pass with impunity Brazen fair and square Scandals, paradise, a doodlebug trap Those haughty fools never learn Chirp and twitter all in unison Chirp, chirp, twitter, twitter The end. ljuin, Manjishi, Nishi-Kagoshima, Kagoshima... We've arrived! Mas... What? Where is everybody? Don't know. Have some more. Could that be me? lt seems like it. Maadha kai (not yet? Maadha kai? Madadayo! (not yet Maadha kay?. Madadayo! Maadha kai? Madadayo! Maadha kai? Madadayo! Professor's new house was completed. Only this pair for men. The rest are for women. My beautiful garden is not that spacious. You'll manage with them. To make the pond, the house had to be squeezed down. When you think of that matchbox house... this is indeed as big as a palace. Right? lndeed it is. We're flattered. Still, l do flatter myself with this doughnut-shaped pond. lt's a brilliant idea. The Pacific may be vast... but swimming straight... you'll reach the shores of America. Swimming round in this pond... the distance is limitless. l want to keep carp in this pond. Big ones you only see in dreams. They could be as big as rowboats. That's impossible. lnfinite this pond may be... they'll curl up and end up motionless. Bad for their backs. l meant it as a figure of speech. Like in the expression... ''gray hair 3,ooo-yard long'' in a Chinese poem. lmagine a carp the size of a whale. By the way... The Golden pavilion is built in a pond, and my house... although small and... and not sparkling,... is quite like it. so put this up. KlNKAKUJl (guests forbidden) This golden Pavilion... forbids such boisterous crowds like us. l'll use it as my study,... so l won't allow any guests. What do you think? lsn't this lot too small? Could be worked out with the plan. LAND FOR SALE Tea is ready. Yes, ma'am. The man who greeted you,... who is he? The owner of that lot. .He came the other day to ask me if l'd buy that lot. l don't have so much money. l have to refuse, but... he was very courteous. Approaching me... so politely, l find it hard to tell him. Seems he found a buyer. Yes, l'm glad. Are you keeping that cat? l call it Nora, because it's a Nora neko (alley cat). My wife gave it dried fish,... and it's lived here. Besides, it has good physiognomy. Cat physiognomy? Sounds odd. How else can l say it? But it does sound rather odd. Anyway, this cat is well-cultured. Better mannered than you. Excuse me. Yes. Be good. He wants to pay his respects to you. Excuse me. What? That's why i came to pay him my respect. -But... -Rot the ''buts''. l bought the land. lt's my land now. l can build whatever l like. That's true, but... you must think about your neighbor. Building a three-story house... next to their fence is unreasonable. Unreasonable? The surveying proved the lot is smaller. Another floor must be added to the two-story house l planned. lf you do that, you'll be... depriving them of the sun. So what? That's none of my concern. Lllet's go! Please wait. The negotiation is closed. Please wait. l've changed my mind. What? l'm not selling. Don't be ridiculous. Now that the contract is made,... the land is mine. l haven't signed it yet. lt's still my land. l absolutely will not sell that land to you. Excuse me. l'm grateful to you for being so considerate about us. l can't thank you enough. But wouldn't it put you... in a bad spot? As for my house, even though there's no sunlight... lf that's the case... But what... -Let's do it. -Shall we? Let's go ask the landowner. Professor, l must say this cat has good qualities. The cat was angry at that blockhead. But that landowner seems to be a good man. Where does he live? He lives in a shack at the base of that lot. We must be leaving. Stay a bit longer. l'm still upset. Let's drink. l've prepared some food and... Sorry, ma'am. l must go. So must l. Good-bye. NANZANJU Professor, what does this Nanzanju mean? Long life of Nanzan. An expression wishing long life. Should be read nanzansu. l hung it up, because l am reluctant to talk to visitors. Nanzansu is ''Whaddya want'' at the brothel. The courtesan used this expression during the Edo Era. Of course, it's short for nan-zamasu. lt's perfect for that blockhead. Nanzansu indeed. My God, he's annoying. l detest that dear man. Good-bye, sir. Good-bye. Something strange is cooking up. Why did they hurry off like that? Good baby, good baby, dear Nora. Let me hold him, too. Hey, let me. Come on. lf you consent to it... Thank you. l can buy a small house with this... and send for my family. l don't know how to thank you. You can thank our professor. He truly is grateful to you. We understand how he feels. So... lf he finds out about this deal, it'll be awkward. l know. Please, keep this a secret from him. He'll know in time... but leave the lot as it is until then. You all... are such nice people. You're a nice person yourself. But the nicest one is our professor. We try as best to imitate him. Good-bye. That was good. By the way... Nanzansu? (What, dear?) Let's drink. Where shall we go? To the professor's. Great idea. That's a charming idea. Professor's in trouble. What's wrong? He isn't sick. The cat disappeared. Madam called me. Wants us to come. Professor hasn't stopped crying since the cat disappeared. Dear... Please. l received a call from Madam. Are you all right? Of course, l am. Nothing more than a cat. Nora has disappeared before. He'll come back. Thank you for coming. l'd be grateful, if you could spare time to eat with us. You'd do me a favor if you could. Since Nora disappeared,... he's eaten almost nothing. You may think l'm stupid. No... To be honest... l am stupid. l'm totally hopeless. Since Nora disappeared... l can think of nothing else. l can't do anything. l only think about Nora. Do you see that willow tree? Nora... came through an opening in the fence there. Since then he became a member of this household. Since Nora disappeared... l can't help... looking at that hole. Nora might be coming thorough the opening in the fence again. l want to see it. The other day... l went to Kyushu to give a lecture. On the way back... Through the window... in the dark station... i saw Nora. it may sound strange, but... l really did see Nora. l saw him clearly. Something bothered me. When l reached Tokyo Station... l called my house. As l thought... That day... after nightfall... Nora wanted to go out. l picked him up and said: ''Stay home, it's late.'' He wanted to go out... so l took him outside. Nora grew impatient and... wiggle until he slipped out of my arms. He went through the opening. After a while... it began to rain. And later it began to pour. Nora probably couldn't return in that rain. On the bathtub cover... is Nora's bed. My husband sometimes goes there. Looks at the cushion. He caresses it dearly... and weeps. l really don't know what to do. Professor! l'm ashamed to show my miserable face. l may be... sentimental... or overreaching or weak-willed or whatever... l just can't help it. l try to forget... but keep remembering Nora. Then l feel so much pain. l can't bear it. Professor, we'll find Nora. We'll organize a search party to find Nora. So please, professor... That's a dog. We promised we would find Nora, but... We should try searching places saved from fire. Why should professor suffer so much? Our professor is very special. He's not you or me. His sensitivity and imagination are beyond us. When he thinks of Nora... he can picture every detail. That's why he suffers. Can't just sit and watch. You're right. Let's try. DEAR NORA This is our professor's diary... which he wrote about Nora with affection. Here. Here. Tio! There are cats everywhere, hundreds around. But it simply has to be this cat. How come? Do you have a brother? Sure, l do. He's still a baby. lf your brother is switched with some other baby... That's terrible. This cat is my baby. l care for him like my child. That's why it has to be this cat. Tell me if you find him. Yes. What it looks like is written here... and the address is here, too. Children. Please find a cat named Nora. This cat seems to be around here somewhere. lt's a male cat with a brown and white coat. His tail is thick and twisted. lf you touch it, you'll know. lf you call out ''Nora''... he will prick up his ears and stare at you. A reward will be given... to whoever finds him. Please help us. Since then, we received many phone calls... that they have seen a cat like Nora. Professor isn't eating much. l know. He eats and drinks very little. l can't sleep much, either. That's terrible. Since Nora disappeared,... he hasn't taken a bath. Nora's cushion is on the bathtub cover. l must use the public bath far away. ls it rain? l used to love the sound of rain. Not anymore. When l think of Nora,... it pains me. How about making flyers to insert in newspapers? l'll take them to the newspaper distributors. That's a good idea. l never thought of it. What a fool l am. l really am. Thinking of Nora's return,... l wrote this announcement. ''l''... meaning Nora... ''l have been away for some time... ''and l have worried my master terribly... ''and given you a lot of trouble. ''l Have safely returned,... so please put your mind at rest. ''Seeing my face,... my master burst into tears. ''l write this letter in his place. ''To celebrate my return... ''my master wishes to invite you all to a drink. ''Please feel free to...'' Waiting for Nora's return,... professor prepared a collar... with their address engraved on it. But Nora still hasn't returned. l received a letter saying l must wait eight months... for a stray cat to return. This person's cat returned safely... after eight months. We've received some calls. There are strange ones, too. The other day, a person asked me if Nora mews. l said, ''yes''. Then he said, ''doesn't he bark? Hee hee hee.'' And hung up. Hello. Yes? Has your cat returned? No. He might have been stolen. Ma'am, cats often get stolen. There are cat-catchers. Catch cats and sell their skin. The prices aren't bad. Shamisen uses cat skin. Your cat could be stolen. l'll check up on that. Good day. Hello. Dear. Dear. Dear, they found Nora. Nora was in such a place? lt's Nora. lt's Nora. Nora! Dear Nora! Nora's friend, the fishmonger's wife, says so. Thank you. My wife will go. l thank you. Hello. Takayama? They found Nora. lt's positive. Can you tell the others? l saw a wonderful dream. l dreamt of feeding Nora. Nora will return. l was going to tell you... and l brought Nora's favorite fish. Professor, congratulations. From my boss. Thank you indeed. Thank you. Congratulations. They were wrong. lt wasn't Nora. l'll get it. That's right. Who the hell are you? l'll smack your face! What's up? Damn! ''Nora's gone. Already a Shamisen''. Saying so, he sounded the Shamisen. Come here. Come here. Come here. This was intended for Nora,... but it's yours now. Go on, eat it. ls it good? Like Nora, you seem to like baby mackerels. That's a good cat. Professor seems to have recovered. Madam called. The cat. Found Nora? Relax. lt's not Nora. That black and white,... Black on white... You relax. Calm down. -Give me water. -Here's some. That's why. What? Calm down. What's this black and white cat? Oh, yes. Remember that cat? The one madam was feeding? lt's there to stay. Professor now picks it up. Kurz. Kurz. What's this ''Kurz''? Did you forget that simple German word? ''Kurz'' lt means ''short'' in German. Has a short tail. -What tail?-The cat's tail! That black and white cat has a short tail... so Professor named it Kurz. Even named it. She said he's Ok. l'm glad to hear that. She wants us all to come tonight. l'll fetch Kiriyama. You fetch Sawamura. -Phone them. -Yes, the phone. The phone's here. Relax. Kuru, Kuru. you're a good baby. Leave it to my wife, and Kurz becomes Kuru. Kuru's not bad. lt's easy to pronounce. Easy to pronounce. Leave it be at that. l really went to pieces over Nora... and troubled you all. Because of that, l caused you so much trouble. l'm sorry. Were's Kurz? Sleeping in Nora's bed. l am so given to peevishness. And linger in regrets. Can you believe that? l still do that. Not mosquito repellent. lncantation to bring back missing cats. l still do such a thing. l'm disgusted at myself. But l'm all right now. l've always been the hare in the myth... saved by the Harvest God. Don't you all know... There was a white hare in inaba Raw fresh with skin peeled off Yes, l remember. Carrying a large bag over his shoulder Who can the Harvest God be? That's the fourth verse. This song has many verses. lt's about an injured hare saved by the Harvest God. l am that hare. And... Who can the Harvest God be? lt is no other than you all. As far as Nora is concerned... people who sent me kind letters... people who called me... all those who worried for Nora with me... the Harvest God is those people. Carrying a large bag over his shoulder The Harvest God's large bag is... full of your kindness. That kindness... saved me form despair. Carrying a large bag over his shoulder The Harvest God came around the bend There he sees the white hare of inaba Raw fresh with skin peeled off The Harvest God took pity on the hare Taught the hare to wash itself in clear water And wrap itself in reed mace cotton As the Harvest God taught him The hare washed itself in clear water And wrapped itself in reed mace cotton He was once again the white hare Gentlemen. Who could the Harvest God be? Towers in memory of Nora and Kurz... were erected in the professor's garden. Nora was never found. Kurz, living a full life,... sleeps here. And the willow tree has grown to this height. THE 1 7TH MAADHA KAl PARTY l now remember the time... when l became 60 years old. At the time... l thought l had become a genuine old man. But now that l have turned 77... to celebrate my birthday again... l realize when l was 60... l was nothing more than a young punk. But now... l have become a genuine old man. At one time, you confronted me with so many Maadha kay calls... that in response l thought of hanging myself... So l can say Mouiiyo (l'm ready) to you But, ironically,... from the willow tree in my garden. At the time, was still small and narrow. lt was useless for hanging. But now the willow tree has grown. lt is good enough for hanging. But l am still here. l must ask your forgiveness. My good friends and gentlemen... l thank you all for this occasion. According to your custom... l will drink up this large glass of beer. The glass has shrunk again. ls this your idea? The glass gets smaller and smaller. lt is no longer a large glass. Even that is too big for you now. Don't complain and drink up. Madadayo! (not yet Let's toast for our professor. Congratulations. By this, we finish the usual Maadha kai ritual. We will now hold our professor's... 77th birthday celebration. First, the presentation of flowers. They're your student's daughters. Happy birthday. Thank you Next,... from the Maadha kai members, a birthday cake. Oh, no. You'll have candles to equal my age... and l must blow them out. l can't do it. Mustn't treat an old man so cruelly. But, professor, since we can't have77 candles... only seven candles. Even seven candles may be a burden. Some of my teeth are missing. Much of the air leaks out. These children? They're their grandchildren. Look how lovely they are. l feel like eating them. l want to give the cake... to the children who brought it. Come here, Children. With this cake, there is something... l want to give you. Let me say this. Please find something you really like. Find something that... you'd be able to treasure. When you find it... Work very hard... for your treasure. At that time,... you will have the treasure... you must work hard for. And it will become a career you put your heart into. That is your real treasure. Too difficult perhaps. l'm sorry. Take it. Thank you. Now, all you grandpas and grandmas... dads and moms... let's drink and have a good time. Professor. Let's do ''One-two'' again. As you say... there are so many... irritating things in the world recently. Graft, bribery are at large One, two Let's go out dancing. Professor! Professor! As the professor's family doctor... l must say there is nothing to worry about. lt is just one of his chronic irregular pulse fits. l suggest he goes home and rests for a while. l'm all right. Don't worry. Madadayo. (not yet We officers will escort professor to his house. Don't worry,... and continue the party for his sake. Professor. My husband's cane. You look so nonchalant. Damn monk. Don't worry. He's not ready for me yet. Thank you. Looking up to our teacher Thinking of our debt to our teacher Over the garden of teaching Countless years have already passed So fast is the passage of time The years and the months... Nothing to worry. lf he rests well tonight, he'll be fine. l'm worried about those guys. They may cause trouble. Don't wake the professor and drink again. You're joking. We'll hit the sack. Don't wet the bed. That quack. Mattresses are in there. Shall l... We'll do it, ma'am. There may not be enough. l hope it won't be cold. No worry... if we have a drink. That's good enough. But... Like our student days. Remember his speech? We'll soon be genuine old men, too. There's nothing. Thank you, ma'am. l'll sleep in the Kinkakuji. lf anything... Don't worry. lt's Ok. You mustn't wake professor. Yes, ma'am. -Good night. -Good night. lt's great. What is? When we used to stay over... he made us prepare for the lessons. That was a real pain. No need for that tonight nor go to school tomorrow. We've passed all that. Madadayo. (not yet He's sound asleep. He must be dreaming. l wonder what kind of dreams he sees. His dreams must be solid gold, too. Maadha Kai? (ready?) Madadayo! (not yet) Madadayo! (not yet) Madadayo! (not yet) Maadha Kai? Madadayo! Madadayo! Madadayo! THE END
