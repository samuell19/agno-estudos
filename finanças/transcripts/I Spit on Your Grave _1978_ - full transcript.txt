Thank you. Take care. Have a nice trip. Hi. High-test, please. Fill it? Yeah. How far is Parkhill Lane from here? It's about a half-mile down the road. You got it? All right. Aw, you missed. Playing it safe, huh? Are you ready for this one? Aw, missed. You're not gonna tell me you got that. It's good. Go ahead. Oh, man. You don't even know how to play the game. There it is. I have to show you everything. Feels good to stretch my legs. I've been driving for three straight hours. You came to a nice place. I've rented a summer house here right by the edge of the river. Never even seen it before. Bet you're gonna like it here. I intend to. In fact, I bet you're gonna like it so well you stay year round. Oh no. Just for the summer. Yeah? You're gonna be owing me your life's savings? I'll tell you what, I'll let you go first this time. I got the game. That'll be $5.20. Come on, let's play another game. All right? All right. Start all over. No pushing. Fair game, okay? Okay, five and 20. Thanks. Have a nice summer. I will. You too. Okay. Your order, ma'am. Hi. I thought you'd never find the place. I've been here before. Oh yeah? Yep. I delivered to the tenant here last summer. I know this whole area like them squirrels here. How much do I owe you? $11.25. Where I come from, people aren't that enthusiastic about their place. Where's that? New York City? Mm-hmm. You come from an evil place. You don't say. Here's a tip from an evil New Yorker. I never got a tip like that before. What's your name? Matthew Lucas. What's yours? Jennifer. You can call me Jenny. Hi, Jenny. Do you live here alone? All alone with Mary Selby. Mary? Mary-- is she in there? Mary's right here. She's a fictional name. She's the leading character in a story I'm going to write here. Oh, are you a writer? Mm-hmm. And you're gonna write a book here? My first novel. I've written many short stories. You must be famous. What's your last name? Hills. It's okay if you've never heard of me. All my stories were published in women's magazines. I don't read 'em. Here. Thanks. You got a boyfriend? I have many boyfriends. Could I be your friend? Sure. Any time you need me, you just call me and I'll be here super fast. Bye. Bye, Matthew. Watch out! Hey, look who's coming. Hey, guys. There's a new chick on the Housatonic. Yeah, she stopped here this morning. I saw her tits. I really did. Shit. Yeah? Do you guys wanna go to the movies? I've seen what's playing twice. Bowling? Yeah, boring. Do you have anything better to offer? Come on. Come on, let's go. What do you wanna do Saturday night? Shit, what is it? Goddamn different. Want to get some beer? I've probably got $3. Whoo! I got another one. I got another one. Shut up, will you? You're gonna scare 'em away. You're gonna scare 'em away. Bring the pail, Matthew. Where the fuck is Matthew? He's taking a shit. You feeling good, Matthew baby? Yeah. Almost like a fucking sensation, eh? He can't tell the difference. Stop it. I can't finish like that. You know, sometimes I look at these gorgeous-looking chicks, I mean, the ones that look like real knockouts-- sexy and all-- and I wonder-- I wonder if they gotta take a shit too. Hey, all women shit. Women are full of shit. Not my mother. My sister is. Oh man, cut out the shit talk. I got another one. I got another one. Yo! Stanley, can I have one fish? God damn it, Matthew, can't you just shit quietly? Don't yell at me, Stanley. I don't like when people yell at me for no reason at all. Scoop some and stuff it in your mouth. You're very rude, Stanley. "You're very rude, Stanley." Sounds like a fucking virgin. He is. Yeah, but he's not gonna stay one for long. We're gonna fix him up with a broad. Hey, Matthew, what do you say? You're interrupting my concentration. A broad, Matthew, a broad. Broads don't turn him on. Yes, they do. But not all broads. Only the special ones. What's a special broad, Matthew? Miss Hills. Miss Hills is special. Who in the fuck is he talking-- Miss Hills? He means that broad from New York. Aw, he got a peek at her tits and already she's special. She's special. She also gave me a dollar for a tip. New York broads are all loaded, Matthew. Yeah, they fuck around a lot. One day I'm gonna go to New York and fuck all the broads there. I'm gonna do the same in California. Why California? Sunset Strip is just swarming with chicks looking to get laid. He wants to go to Hollywood and become another movie star. Another Robert Redford. There's only one Robert Redford. Did I say I wanna be Robert Redford? Hey, Greenwich Village is where you want to go, man. I mean, chicks come from all over the country and they go to the Village for one reason. And that's to get laid. "Chapter 8-- page one.

He can't see without his fucking glasses. Really. See-saw, Margery Daw, fucking for the fans. I can't come. I can't come. You're interrupting my concentration. Hey, what's the matter, Matthew baby, huh? I can't. I can't, not when people are watching me. Awww! Poor baby! He likes to shit and fuck in total privacy. I'm sorry. I can't finish like that. Aw shit, you can't finish any way. That's not fair. Fucking impotent. He comes. He comes when he jerks off. That's not fair. Hey, listen to this, you guys. What? What? "Finally after weeks of self-doubt and much deliberation, she embarked on a temporary leave of absence from everything that formed the fabric of her life." "Her hectic daily schedule..." Oh, hectic. "...restless days, sleepless nights..." Aww. She's definitely sleeping. "...the men who made love to her." Awww. The men who made love to her. I said the men who made love to her! Yeah, love! "For once, she had to be alone." Shh. Shh. "Recluse." Recluse. "Untouched." Untouched. Untouched! Untouched. Well, now you said it, Stan. New York broads fuck a lot. Hey, fucking A, man. No! I'm hurt. Please, I'm hurt. I'll do it to you with my hand. You'll like it. You'll see. Total submission. Come on, get on with it. Let's go. Bitch, you little whore! Okay okay okay. Let's split. Come on, Stanley. Hey, shut up. Let her suck it! Hey, come on, Stanley. You're wasting time. She lies like a fucking mannequin, you bitch! You wanted total submission, you got it. Hey, shut up, stupid. Give me a second! Okay okay. Hey hey, come on! Come on! Okay, enough, let's go. Let's split. Shit, man, wait a minute. We can't let her go. We just can't let her go. Go where? Go, man, go! Matthew, I want you to go back and do her, okay? It's real easy. Why are we doing this? We got what we wanted. Come on, asshole. If she's dead, she can't point a finger at us. Why me? Why me? I didn't even come. Because I want you to do it, God damn it, that's why. No. Well, let me tell you something. Don't you ever fucking come back around here again. You hear me? Fucking asshole. Dumb turkey. Shit. Come here, Matthew. Come here. Come on. Hey, listen. There's gonna be a bunch more broads, huh? You'll come next time. Come here. Come on. Come on. Hey, we won't let you out on any of them, huh? We should choose a lottery. Matthew, I don't have time to fuck around. Now come on. Hey. We're depending on you, okay? I've done it a lot of times, okay? You got to get used to it. Pick it up. Come on. I'll show you how. Come on. Take it like this. So you're gonna have it Iike this. Just stab her once nice and deep in the heart. Okay? It'll all be over with. It's real easy. Over here? No no no. Over here. Right between the ribs. Okay? So the knife is like that. Once deep to the heart, all right? Come on now. We're depending on you. You won't leave without me? We'll stay right here. You'll stay here? We're gonna stay here, Matthew. Don't go. Come on. Don't leave me. Don't leave me. Matthew, we don't have all day. Matthew, come on, go. Don't leave me. All right. Okay. Matthew! Matthew! Here. Here, give me that. Good boy, Matthew. Chocolate sundae for me, Suzy. Hot fudge, nuts, cherry on top? Man, the town is too peaceful lately. I don't hear any exciting news. Mrs. Gate is getting a divorce. She told me. She said she's gonna have to cut down on my tips. What else is new, Matthew? Nothing. That's the latest. Have you guys been riding by her place lately? I suggested it to Stan. He refused. It might be a trap. They might suspect us. Since criminals always return to the scene of the crime. They might be there waiting for us. What fucking idiots you guys are. It's been two weeks, man. Two 90 deg weeks. You know what two weeks like that does to a dead body? The body will decompose. Yeah, and it will poison the air with a stench, Matthew, that can be smelled for hundreds and hundreds of yards around, a stench that's a hell of a lot worse than your fucking shit. Tell me, Matthew, where did you stab her? Here. Where you told me to. How deep? Deep, real deep. This deep. Maybe she's really dead. Maybe she crawled into somewhere before she collapsed and died, huh? It could be. Maybe she went to the basement where there's no air. I stabbed her. I did. There was blood all over. I had to jump over the puddles. Here you are. Thanks. Go on, Matthew. Have your ice cream. I don't want it anymore. You better have it. 'Cause I want you to stay cool. I'm gonna send you on a mission, Matthew, a very important mission. I can't. I can't! I can't stand to look at dead people. Ask me anything, but not that. You killed one yourself! Man, you are really gonna fuck us up with your loud mouth. Hey, Stanley. Come on, Stanley. Hey, the beer's on me, huh? Come on, gimme a smile. One of your handsome ladykiller smiles. Thattababy. You and Stanley... are gonna go. In the Marines we call it reconnaissance. Okay? You come back with me to the station, okay? All right. Fucking idiot! God damn you! No no no no! Prick. Prick! Son of a bitch! Fucking asshole. Jerk! My glasses. My glasses! Where did my glasses-- What a piece of cowshit. Fucking idiot! Take your fucking glasses. Fuck! Bastard! Fucking ass! Get the fuck out of here! Go on, get out of here! Dumb shit! Prick! If I ever see you here again, I'm gonna bust your ass. Little bastard! Goddamn imbecile. Forgive me. Forgive me. Daddy! Daddy! Hey! Daddy, tell him to give me back my dollar. He stole my dollar. I didn't. He's lying. Hey! Hey hey! Yahooooo! Daddy, tell him to give me back my dollar. I didn't steal her dollar. Come on, kids, cut it out. I'm gonna get you. Hi, honey. Hi. They've been fighting like this since they came home from school. Come on, stop it, kids. I'll give you another dollar. So stop chasing him. Dad, tell her to stop. I'll tell you what: Daddy's gonna close the place down and we'll all go fishing. Yeah yeah. I hate fishing. It's boring. Supermarket. This is the house on Parkhill Lane. I'd like to order some items. Give me your order, ma'am. Hey, Matthew, get this to the house on Parkhill Lane. You came superfast, Matthew. Here, Matthew. Matthew, over here. I hate you! I hate you! What have I done to you, Matthew? You brought nothing but bad luck with you. Bad luck! I have no friends now because of you. Why, Matthew? Why because of me? I was chosen to kill you and I didn't. You will this time, Matthew. You will. Just relax. I'm sorry I have to do this. I'm also sorry for what I did to you with them. It wasn't my idea. I have no friends in town. I thought we were friends. Remember? You asked me? You're here only for the summer. What am I to do the rest of the year? I could have given you a summer to remember for the rest of your life. Supermarket. This is the house on Parkhill Lane. An hour ago I ordered a few things and nobody's come to deliver. Sorry for the delay, ma'am. I'll check on it. Thank you. Gas station is closed, ma'am. Sunday we only open half-day. Come tomorrow. I knew you were gonna like it here. Well? Oh, you want me to open the door for you. Okay. Stay where you are. You're kidding. Take off your clothes. You don't have to force me. I'll do it to you voluntarily. Your clothes. I don't like women giving me orders. Shit! All right, look. All right, but you're after the wrong man. Look, I was conned into this whole thing. Stanley, the dark-haired guy, the man is a sex maniac. The pants. Now on your knees. Don't. Please don't. Look, you can't do this to me. I got a family. A nice-looking wife, two beautiful kids. And you don't care? No guilty conscience? Come on, this thing with you is a thing that any man would have done. You coax a man into doing it to you, and a man gets the message fast. Now look, whether he's married or not, a man is just a man. Hey, first thing, you come into the gas station and you expose your damn sexy legs to me, walking back and forth real slow, making sure I see 'em good. And then Matthew delivers the food to your door. Come on, he sees half your tits peeking out at him. Tits with no bra. And then, you're lying in the canoe in your bikini, just waiting like bait. Come on, I'll give you a hot bath. How old are your children? Let's see, the girl is 10, and the boy, he's nine already. How do you know about my wife and kids? I wanted you the other day. I came by your place. They were there. You love your children? Sure I do. And your wife? Do you love your wife? She's okay. You get used to a wife after a while, you know? I don't want to talk about my family. Okay. How are your friends? What friends? Your friends. You mean those guys? Shit. They're not my friends. You know, they hang on me like leeches. Fucking goofing off all the time. I really despise people that don't work. Get into trouble too easily, you know? Matthew works. He's okay. Matthew is a half idiot. Hey, you know they called me yesterday from the supermarket asking if I've seen him. Disappeared since yesterday. Took off with his bike somewhere. Nobody knows where or why. Ah, yeah. Oh. Oh yeah. You got great hands. Oh, God bless your hands. He's a very touchy boy, this Matthew. He's very sensitive. We had a little fight with him yesterday. Scared the shit out of him. He'll come back. He'll never come back. Yeah, he will. He'll cool off. He's cooling off, all right. At the bottom of the river. What? You think he committed suicide or something? No, I killed him. No you didn't. Yes I did. I choked him to death with a rope. Come on, you did not. I did. You've got one fantastic sense of humor. I let Matthew kiss and have me before I killed him. And you know what? Mmm? He came. He actually came. You've got a weird, weird sense of humor. Do I? Oh yeah. Yeah. Oh yes! Oh, that's great. Oh yeah. You've got great hands. God bless your hands. Oh yeah, that's fantastic. Oh yes yes. How sweet. How sweet. Oh, that's great. That is great. That's so sweet it's painful. Oh God. Oh my God. Shit. Oh Jesus. Oh Jesus! Oh shit. Look what she's done to me! Oh God! Oh shit! Oh Jesus. Oh God. Oh God! Look what she's done to me! Oh shit! Mother. Mother. Oh my Lord. Oh no! Oh God! I can't stop the bleeding! Oh God! Somebody help me! Oh Jesus, no! Stop. Stop it. Oh no. Stop it, yes yes. Oh, it won't stop bleeding. It won't stop bleeding! It won't stop. It won't stop. No! Oh! Let me out of here! My husband fucking never disappears on me. He's not that kind of a man. He's loyal to me. He's a good father and a good husband. Fucking bums. Why do you hang out here all the time? Huh? Where is he? Get out of here! Get out. Get out of here! Get out of here! Get the fuck out of here. Fucking bums. I'll break your goddamn heads if you come back here again. I scared you, didn't I? Huh? Not a bit. Where's your friend? He stayed back in town. I'm glad. It's you I wanted. Bitch! Fucking slut. Hey, what do you think you're doing? Andy! Andy! Andy! Andy, help me! Andy! Help! Help! Andy, help me! Get her! Get her! Do something! Murderer! Murderer! Fucking bitch! I'm gonna kill you. You slut! Leave him alone! I'm gonna tear you up! I'm gonna get you! I'm coming, Stanley! Come on! Turn around. Lean on my arm. Whoa! No no, Andy! Don't leave me. Help! Don't fucking leave me! Help me. Please. Please. I don't wanna die. Please. Come on. Please, help me. I don't wanna die. I don't wanna die. It wasn't my idea. I didn't want to do it to you. I'm sorry. I really am. It was Johnny. Johnny talked me into it. Johnny made me do it. I didn't wanna do it. He made me do it. Suck it, bitch!
