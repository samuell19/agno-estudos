Because out of jealousy, this hurt mind may not do something bad. I've no right over you from today. You belong to somebody else now. But when you go around the holy fire, with your husband... ...think this to be a funeral pyre of my love. Yours, Kailash. No, Kailash. No! Why not? I haven't wetted my throat as yet. - Want to drown your sorrow? - Sorrow? What sorrow? Your Madhavi is marrying somebody else today, isn't she? I've enjoyed and sent packing countless such girls in my life. I regret just one thing. I lost access to her uncle's wealth. So you wish to burn this ache with the fiery embers of liquor? The fire that I ignite... I know how to douse it too. Let me go. What are you doing? Who can it be so late in the night? - I'm back, Kailash. - But, you were to wed today! Yes, but I threw all the social norms to the wind, and ran away. - Why did you do that? - I didn't... your love did it. Your letter gave me such confidence that before entering the pandal... ...I came to you. Burning my boats! You shouldn't have done that. Your uncle will never forgive you for this blunder you've committed. You've done this impulsively. Better leave me alone and go back. This will be better for us. - Please don't say that. I'll be better off here, loving you all my life. Love and wealth have their own places. Both are essential in life. - You're saying funny things today. - I was just... I mean if you run away like this, your uncle will disown you! I love you, that's why I can never bear... ...any injustice done to you. Had your uncle given his consent... ...his wealth would've helped us in our new life. So this is the real you! Betrayer! Fraud! Gold digger! Under the pretext of love, you've been cheating on me! Why weren't you unmasked just one day before? Don't touch me! Don't even take my name! I hate you! I hate you, I say! She might as well commit suicide! She has brought shame... - ...to the uncle who reared her! - She looked so naive! But see what she did. Her uncle will have to hide his face in his old age now! Forgive me, uncle. I've reduced the respect you commanded, to dust. The mistake that I've committed, is not a mere error, it's a sin! You better throttle this niece of yours now! Death is the only way to make up for my sin! Why don't you say something, uncle? Say something! Answer me! No! If I'm not mistaken, aren't you Madhavi, niece of Baburam? You jilted your groom! Want to try a hand at others? Hey! Madhu? Recognize me? - I have seen you after long. - Where are you going? Your... What...? No! - No, Poonam. This can't... - It's true. It's 6 months now. In a jeep accident. How cruel God is! Those who need mercy, He does injustice to them! - Where are you going? - Nainital. My in-laws live there. I'm going for the first time. To your in-laws for the first time? Yes. We had married against his father's wishes. I wouldn't have gone now. But I'm going only for his sake. You didn't tell me anything about yourself. I heard you were to marry. - I was to marry, but I didn't. - Why not? It's a long story. Okay. Now tell me, where are you going? What does a leaf in a storm know of its destination? I can't leave you alone without a shelter like this. - Come to my in-laws with me. - No. What will they say? Nothing. I'll tell them you're my sister. I've no other blood relation anyway. So I brought you along. - Suppose they find out the truth? - We're not lying, my dear. You're my childhood friend. And they've never seen me. They're strangers to me, and I'm unknown to them! We'll share our joys and sorrows and spend our life, rearing him. - Your train's coming. - All right. You'll have to come! Let's go. - What are you thinking about? - Had you not helped me... ...what would I have done? Forget all that now. Come. I'll show you some photographs. This is my son's birthday photo and these are our wedding ones. How handsome your husband was! What was his name? Shekhar. Now I live only on his memory. These are his letters. Which make me feel as though he's always near me. And this letter is from my father-in-law. He's written... God has snatched our son from us... ...only to punish us for our error. But now, I'll just say this. You have our family's heir. If you can, forgive us, your in-laws.. ... and come with him to us. Our house will always await you. Sounds as though he has penned this with a grieving heart. Good that you decided to go and meet them. This is an emergency hospital. Your train had an accident. - Where's Poonam? - We don't know anybody's name. - When you get well, see for yourself. - I'm perfectly well. - Who are you? - Her sister. Good thing you're here. She's very critical. She tried to swallow poison. - I've sedated her now. - Come, doctor. Look, we're short of staff. You better sit with her. Kill me. Please let me die. No, Poonam. - Who is it? - It's me, Madhu. Your friend. My son...? He's sleeping. Look over there. My darling! Madhu... Come closer. - I am right here. Yes? - I'm going now. No, don't say that. Promise me, Madhu. That you'll take care of him and bring him up. - We'll both bring him up together. - No. He's yours now, and you're his mother. No, dear friend. You'll be well soon. No! No! My legs are amputated. Yes! My in-laws... ...they'll never give an invalid the status of a daughter-in-law. You go there in my place. No! It's not possible. I can never do this. Will you leave him as an orphan? Won't you bring him up? - It's not that, but I... - Promise me, Madhu. Promise that you'll live there like his mother. - No! - Promise me. I won't die peacefully otherwise. Promise me... Please come. Very sorry about your sister. What's your name? And your son's? Where will you go now? Your address? How much more do we travel? - About an hour or two, madam. An hour or two? Stop at some hotel en route. - We need some milk. - Right, Ma'am. Give it to me. - Where are you taking us? - We'll reach earlier this way. - Before evening, in fact. - This is a jungle! Turn back. Turn back, I said! Turn back! Can't you hear? - Get aside! - Stop the car! - Else, I'll jump off! - Really? With this kid? - Give me all the money you have! - Help! Help! - Your purse. - Thank you. - If you hadn't... - Mention not. You can't go in this taxi, but I could drop you in my jeep. - Where do you want to go? - Nainital? - This road goes to Almora. - The driver took the wrong road. You shouldn't go alone in this weather. Going further is impossible. The mountain streams overflow, and the road is closed at night. What! Then, how... how will I...? Don't panic. I'm a forest officer. And my house is near by. If you trust me, spend the night in my house. I'll take you tomorrow. - Has Munna slept? - Yes. - You're fond of poetry too? - Pardon? Yes, a long time ago. I not only read them, but wrote them too. The last one was a song. But that too remained unfinished. Neither is there any emotion... Nor there is any desire. My life is nothing but a felled, drifting kite! Beautiful! But when I realized, life's harsh reality... ...it ended the delicate inspiration of poetry. And now... ...now I like these dense forests, perilous atmosphere and wild animals. Anyway, forget it. I want to ask you something. Go ahead. Ever since I've met you, I feel as though I've seen you somewhere. Sometimes, after seeing a person, he seems an old acquaintance. What did you say your name was? Where do you stay in Nainital? I don't stay there. I'm going for the first time. To my in-laws. The in-laws live there, and going for the first time? I don't quite follow. My husband married me against their wishes. That's why. I see. May I ask you who they are? The retired collector there is my father-in-law. The owner of "Lake View"? You're Shekhar's wife? - But that train accident... - She survived it! - Ironic, isn't it? - It's wonderful! - How do you know my in-laws? - It's my second home. My father and he are like brothers. In childhood, Shekhar and I played and studied together. But we parted ways when we grew up. Then I went to Germany. When I returned, I heard that Shekhar had married. And then... that accident. Life is so quaint! Today I'm seeing my friend's wife for the first time. That too, as a widow! Such a close relation. No wonder I felt that I had seen you before. What are you thinking? What will my in-laws say and think when they see me? What else, except absolute joy when they see their heir with you? And then, you're their only support in their old age. - Shall I serve the food, master? - Oh yes. She must be hungry. Listen. She's not just my guest, but the daughter-in-law of Diwanji too. Neither she nor Diwanji should get a chance to complain. But of course! I'll be only too pleased. It's impossible to go in this rain. So I'll escort you in the morning. - See you in the morning. - Are you going somewhere? Can't help it. There's a party on. I'll have to go. If I'm late in returning, don't worry. Feel at home. - Did you keep the crate in the car? - Yes, I did. Listen. I don't ask where and why you go. But it's a stormy night. You also have a guest. Will it matter if you don't go? You've been sent here to work. So don't meddle in my affairs. Go and do your chores. Go and work he says! I reared him, and now he bosses me! Come, my dear. Have your dinner. Come. Does your master go out every night? I try and convince him, but he doesn't heed me. He's busy the whole day and gets restless towards the evening. He goes to the club or wanders in the jungles too. And tries to drown his sorrow in drinks. Does he booze too? He never touched it before. Even when he was abroad. - But now... - What happened? You could say nothing, or everything too! Sincerity brought him betrayal! Ever since, he's a broken man. Who betrayed him? - A girl! - A girl! Yes. Why keep it from you? His father had chosen a girl. He agreed without seeing the girl. - Then? - Then something queer happened. When they went to the girl's house, she had run away. What... are you saying? That girl must be a devil to have ditched such a gentleman! - Where was the wedding? - In Gangapur. Love... is meant for those... who, with the beloved's name on their lips... will die, will be destroyed... and get a bad name for themselves. Forget it, friends... I won't ever fall in love. A lost drink one can always retrieve... but may no one ever play with someone's heart. Should one be heart-broken... the things that can happen. Love... is meant for those... who, with the beloved's name on their lips... die, destroy themselves... and get a bad name. Never mind, forget it... I'll never fall in love. I'm afraid I might be hooked when I look into their eyes. The lanes of the beautiful girls, I walk by... with a distant salute. Love... is meant for those... who, with the beloved's name on their lips... will die, will be destroyed... and earn ill-fame. Forget it, friends... I'll never ever fall in love. Never mind... I'll never fall in love. - You're early, aren't you? - I know I'm late. Tell Poonam I'll take her now. - She has gone! - Gone? Then? What she must think! - But how and where did she go? - Home, where else? I tried to stop her, but she... Eventually I put her in a truck. That's very bad. You should have gone with her! - She stopped me! She left this. - A letter? You may go. I'll never forget the trouble you went through because of me. Your last poem is the story of my life. There's no hope, no emotion within... My life is like a felled drifting kite. - This is Diwanji's mansion. - Thank you very much. Where the hell is everybody? Anybody there? - What's the matter, sir? - Is this breakfast? Without salt? - The doctor said it was harmful. - Then go and feed him this! Who's there? What the... Who are you? I'm Poonam. Your daughter-in-law. - What! - And here's the letter you wrote. Daughter-in-law... You're Shekhar's wife? And this is your treasure. His heir. My son's son? Am I dreaming, my dear? - You're telling the truth? - Yes, father. That train accident... You survived it! Yes. I survived to take care of you... ...and to hand over the heir to your lineage. My darling! My grandson... Look who's here! Our daughter-in-law. Our grandson! Go and call your mistress... My darling grandson. What is it? Come downstairs. Your son's wife, her son are here. My son's wife? Her son? What are you talking about? Come downstairs and see how lovely your son's wife and the baby are! Come. Look, my dear, our son's wife, our dear grandson are here. My daughter-in-law! - Mother! - My grandson! You're my son's wife! My daughter-in-law. My grandson! See? How strange are the ways of God. Sometimes He takes away everything, and at times, He gives so much! We made a great mistake in rejecting a daughter-in-law like you. Today we've atoned for our sins. You came, so did our grandson. Our gloomy house is bright with light once again. May I come in? Come in. Bless you. You've come at the right moment. Look who's here. Shekhar's wife and son. - I've met them before. - How come? Her taxi-driver was wanting to rob her of her money. I happened to reach in time, and that rascal ran away. Last night... ... due to the storm, I took them home. Bless you. It's due to his goodness that I'm now here before you. Come. You must be tired. Rest a while. Don't go, Kamal. Give him tea, and then bring the case upstairs. - Okay, ma'am. - Come, my dear. You've come after days, son. - Let's play chess. - Will do, uncle. This is Shekhar's room. Ever since he left, everything here has been as it was. As if he were about to return. But it's all an illusion. False hopes. Give it to me. I'll keep it in the cupboard. If you see it, it'll only make you unhappy. No! He left me and went away... ...now if I can't see his photograph, it'll be difficult to pull on. True. We have but past memories to go on living now. Freshen up a bit, and I'll make you some snacks. - Yes? - Run a bath for her. - May I say something? - Yes? I got a chance to say it now. Young master was right when he said his wife was as lovely as a full moon! But now the moon is blemished. What nonsense! Okay, tell me. Do you like the house? - I've not... - I simply forgot! You haven't even seen it as yet. Come on. I'll take you around. See this. A lake in the front. Hills behind. Jungle all around. Everyone says this house is the crown of Nainital. But... ...somebody cast an evil eye. And the young master never returned. Master fell ill. He was a quiet man, but now he gets irritated easily. Madam was very hot tempered. But now she's very quiet. Chatting away again? You are wanted downstairs. She's my sister. - A born chatter box! - Shut up! Don't listen to him. He's a liar! Shirker! Less work, more noise! Honestly, I've to do all the work. Really? Then you're a good boy. What's your name? I came to call her and got chatty. I forgot I've to polish shoes. I'll go now. See you later. What's going on? Have you lost your senses? Not at all. Try being a "horsey" one day. You'll have fun! - Your breakfast, father. - Why you, dear? Where's the maid? You don't like servants making food, so I made it myself. - Taste it. I think you'll like it. - Of course I will. Eat slowly, friend. You're eating as though you're starving for a week! You have a long life. We were just talking about you. Have a seat. I heard that your son's wife, and son are here. Thought I'd meet them. This is my daughter-in-law. And this is Munna, my grandson. This is my doctor. But more of a friend than a doctor. Honestly, you have a very beautiful daughter-in-law. Don't cast your evil eye on her! And today instead of taking my B.P... ...better check your own. Now I don't even think that I'm ill. That's very good. And now, stop all the medicines, and take a tonic. - Forget it! - Doctor, don't you worry. I'm responsible for his welfare now. I'll get the tonic. Keep these, and if any other brand comes, keep that too. Don't tell him, tell me! He doesn't know that... -.. "scotch" is a black market item. - Then buy it in "black" for me! Really? Too good! What will it be? "Black Dog"? You idiot! What are you blabbering? Welcome, Madam. What do you want? - You? - I had come for some tonic. Too good! I'll just get it. - How come you're here? - Madhavi? You, here? - You meant me? - Yes. Didn't you recognize me? I'm Rakesh. We studied together in the Lucknow University. You've forgotten, that I had failed for 3 years and yet reached the final? - Well, I... - Better change your glasses. She's Poonam. Shekhar's wife, and daughter-in-law of Diwanji! But how can that be? The same face, same complexion... -... same eyes, same voice! - Don't get shocked. You're mistaken. Sometimes two people can have same features. I suppose so. - Here are your things, and the bill. - It can be paid later. - Haven't you packed those bottles? - I'll pack them now. - A real sample! - Your brother too! Step aside, please. I wish to ask you something. - Yes? Need man take support of deceit for peaceful living and satisfaction? I don't get you. Every man has some sorrow. If liquor could erase all the sorrows... ...every man would be an alcoholic. Good bye. Here's your whiskey, sir. - Cancel it! - Very strange! Pappu! Where are you? - Where are you? - Say "I'm here". Come let's run. Mummy's coming... - Where are you? - I'm here! Let's go... Had I not seen with my own eyes, I wouldn't have believed it! That you can laugh and play too! - Pappu forced me to play. I forgot everything in this madness. Madness? Joy is a ripple in the mind. Nobody can stop it. Poetry can entertain the mind, but not convince it. A mind that has been crushed by misfortune and social norms... ...why console it with false sympathy? You don't know the power of the mind! A mind that has feelings... ... determination, can break every kind of bondage. And what about the mind that has no hope or emotion within? Whose life is like a cut, drifting kite? - These words are from your poem. - That's my unfinished poem. Even a finished poem can't change the fate of a kite, once it's cut! Its sorrows drift it here and there with no direction or destination. - When did you come, Kamal? - Great! You've begun to step out. I deliberately took him to the lawyer. The doctor said... - ...he must go out a bit. - His treatment seems to be working. - His treatment? Say her care. - You're right. She and her son have brought liveliness and joy to your home. Please sit down. I'll just send some coffee. So! Why are you here and how are you? I'm fine. Actually, I came to invite you folks. - What for? - My birthday party. - Thought you should come too. - Bless you. Congratulations. But as you know, we don't go to any party. If none of you come, my party will be incomplete. Do one thing. Talk to Poonam. If she agrees, we won't mind. She never steps out! I've told her many times. But she doesn't listen. She doesn't listen to her. You try. She may agree. Where's the harm in trying? It'll do her good. She'll enjoy it. - Then I'll try my best! - Look, you also talk to her. You? - May I come in? - Of course. - I hope I didn't disturb you. - No. Sit down. Thanks. Your in-laws were complaining about you. About me? What wrong did I do? They said you don't go anywhere. - Not even to your neighbors. - It's become a kind of habit. I just don't feel like going anywhere. - If you're invited out of love... - Then I'll ask to be excused. - But why are you asking all this? - I'm having a party at the club. Thought I'd ask you, and that you won't refuse. The question of my attending your party simply doesn't arise. It's nothing special. Some friends and officers will come. Actually, it's my birthday. Really? My best wishes. Just best wishes? Won't you come? - I'm sorry. - Your in-laws have no objection. If you're willing, they don't mind. They mustn't have thought of the wagging tongues! I thought I'd convince you. If what people say... ... means more than your dear ones, I leave the decision to you. Bye! - Whom are you waiting for? - For us! We're here. - These garlands of flowers... - Please accept as yours. What nonsense is this! Idiot! - You know us all right! - Actually, the world calls us that. Welcome, Poonam. I knew you'd come. - My in-laws forced me to come. - How happy I am to have you here. She is Diwanji's daughter-in-law and my childhood friend's wife... Poonam. And this is... We've already met. I think, you better be born fast. Cut the cake quickly. My stomach's rumbling. That day you may have felt bad about what I said. But honestly, Madhavi was just like you. I've a group photo too. - I'll find it for you. - Show it to her and confuse her more. Cut the cake. - Congratulations. - Thank you. Friends, from all of us here... ...hearty congratulations to Kamal on his birthday. But on this joyous occasion we've a request for him. - That he recite one of his poems... - In his sweet voice... ... with melodious music, and oblige us all. - You'll have to recite it now. - In front of all... They're all insisting, so sing it for them. Since you're asking me to, I'll oblige. Friends, I had stopped penning poetry. But for some days now, I felt my dormant emotions awaking. My desires aroused. The shape those emotions and desires have given birth to... I'm presenting before you as a song. Love is blind and crazy. It's above all joys and sorrows. It's like playing with fire. Which burns everything. Even then people dare to love. It's above all joys and sorrows. Love is blind and crazy. It's above all joys and sorrows. Love cannot be hidden... even if one wants to. The heart finds its own match. It's above all joys and sorrows. Listen to what this poet once said... even the world cannot stop its flow. It pours out automatically. It's above all joys and sorrows. Love is blind and crazy. It's above all joys and sorrows. The silence of this street seems so nice after that noisy party. What were you lost in? I'm trying to free myself from your beautiful poetry and sweet voice. - This means you liked my song. - Very much! Truly, had I not come today, I'd have never known how well you sing. Good enough! I'm happy that you enjoyed my party. I was scared that in your party there wouldn't be... What? ...what usually happens in parties. Chaos and getting drunk. Does man need a false support for peaceful living and satisfaction? What? Didn't you say this in that general stores? Since then I've given up the false support of alcohol. Can anybody leave liquor at somebody's request? There's a difference between anybody, somebody and you! A small gift... On your birthday. I felt awkward giving it to you in front of everyone. This will be my most valuable gift, because you gave it to me. Forgive me. I came to you on first terms. One is not formal with those who are younger. And then... ...informality has its own intimacy. I've learnt one thing from you. One needn't marry to come close. Whomever you get intimacy from is your very own. Let's go. There you are! We were waiting for you. - How was the party? - Fine. But I missed you both. - Poonam made up for us. - True. Okay, I'll go now. - There's a letter from your father. - Me too. Same old story. Marriage! That's all very well, but you'll have to accept it one day. The girl's coming with her mother. See her and decide. He knows it. You also pen him. I'm not interested in marriage! Bye. - This boy will never heed. - He's been wronged. - Can't he forget her? - Do you know about him? Yes. His servant told me everything. Do one thing. Find out what's on his mind when you chat. He may listen to you. We've given up convincing him! Okay. Look, my dear. Behave properly. Kamal is an excellent boy. Boys are all the same. I know how to handle them. Don't be childish however. Here they come. - This is Kamal. - Greet her... Bless you. Come this way. This is my daughter. And her pet name is Munni! She's always spoiling my name! I'm not a kid anymore. Meet this gentleman. He's Mr. Kamal Sinha. What's "Hi"? She's Mrs. Shekhar. Why are you standing? Come and sit. Yes. Let's sit. - Is this your first visit here? - Not for me, but it is, for her. It's my second visit! I had come when I was a kid. But it's your first visit since you've grown up. Who told you that your daughter's grown up? - You seem a jovial man. - Yes, I pull legs now and then! - What will you have? - Tea. - And you? - Same, what about you? I'll tell you her choice. A double "Tootie-frootie"! - How did you guess? - Children usually like such things. - You're teasing me already! - Naturally! Who else will he tease? - Then has he liked my Munni? - So you thought her Munni... Please start... My name is Shabnam. People fondly call me Shabbo. Recognize me? We've met. That night...? Do not be afraid. It's a secret. And the secret will remain a secret. My name is Shabnam. People fondly call me Shabbo. What's your name...? Meena, Leena, Anju, Manju...? or is it Madhu? The bridal music all night. There I was. So were you... and... Don't be shy. Don't be afraid. I'm not going to tell anyone. Know what...? My name is Shabnam. Out of love, people call me Shabbo. And what's your name...? Meena, Leena, Anju, Manju...? or is it Madhu? These stains can be washed away, but what about the one's on your soul. How long will I pay for my mistake? I'm not asking anything from You. But please don't take the peace of mind you've given me. Peace of mind lies in love. And love is no mistake. You? I phoned your place and was told you had come here. Anyway, today I saw the deity and her devotee! Last night you came away, and I got caught between that Munni and Mummy! I deliberately left, so that you all could chat comfortably. Comfortably? They forced me to dine with them. It was very late, so I went home and slept. - You slept at least. - Meaning? I meant Munni mustn't have slept at all. - Both were dozing while eating. - Really? Then what was decided? - That's left to you. - Congratulations! - You'll make a first class couple! - You're very right. But remember, my salary is less and that fatso's ice creams cost more. You look so beautiful when you laugh! I've been thinking a lot about one thing since yesterday. - What about? - Do you have a twin? That shopkeeper mentioned it, and so did that cheap dancer. And the strangest thing is, the girl that I was to wed... her name was Madhu too! If you meet that Madhu again, will you be able to forgive her? I've nothing against her today. The pain she gave... ...has been over-shadowed by somebody else. - Who? - You! May I go now? We're going to the same place, by the same road, but in 2 boats. Isn't it possible for us to walk together? A place where you do not live... I wouldn't even walk across, my love. A path that does not lead to you... I wouldn't ever step on it. A place where you do not live... For all the merriment life offers... for all the colorful flowers that blossom. And so much for what Spring offers... the garden where a thorn pierces your feet... from that garden, a flower I'd never want to have. A place where you do not live... Break all norms and customs... come to me, draped in love. Or I will leave this world itself. A place where your memories torment me... I wouldn't want to spend a moment there. A place where you do not live... that place, I'd never want to even pass by. I'm stepping out after a long time! This lake. That temple... this club. Everything is as it was to the world. But after Shekhar's death, nothing was the same for us! See those boats? Look how they're playing around with the waves. - It's the first time... - You, my friend? - How did the sun rise in the West? - She forced me! Good thing too! I was tired of lecturing him! He just refused to go out, or meet anyone! He invited illness. - From today make it a rule! - Lecturing again? Sit down! Sit, eh? You get up! There's the club. To pass time we'll play cards. Old friends will be happy to see you. - No. I... - Go on, father. You'll enjoy yourself. - That's what I mean too. - Okay. Let's go. You'll get bored sitting here. Munna's alone, so go home. - I'll come with him. - Okay. Your daughter-in-law is really an angel. She has changed the scene totally. She has made you forget your tragedy. When I think about her, my heart literally breaks! - What'll happen to her after I die? - May I say something? If I was in your place, I'd have got her remarried. - Why get so cross about it? - Why did you say such a thing? I just suggested it. If you're offended, I'm sorry. Come on, let's go. Take the car back. Toys? - Who brought these toys? - I did! - For your son. - You? Thank God you remember me. Why are you here? What was the need? I missed you. Came to know you were here, so I came. - Go away from here! - So soon? But it'll take me some time to tell my story. She's making tea for me. There's nobody else at home. Honestly, Madhu. I'm really repenting. That day I couldn't value your love. Please forgive me. - That Madhu is dead! - Then so is that Kailash you knew. Look. I know everything about you. - Why not start a new life together? - Don't talk nonsense! I hate the sight of you! Get out of here! Go! Go! Go, I say! - Peace! Peace! - You? Thank God your wrath hit my foot. Had it hit my head... Who are you? I'm Kailash. She's my distant relation. - Very happy to meet you... - I'm Kamal. Now tell me, her aunt sent some toys for her son... Where have I erred in this? - Why lose your temper over this? - But she's right in a way. When she was widowed, her Aunt didn't care about her. When she found out Poonam had married well, she apologized. This is common in relatives. Poonam, keep this toy to please him. - Get the tea here. - I'm very obliged to you. If you hadn't come, I don't know how this relation would've remained. - Sit down. Have some tea. - Excuse me... It's against norms to drink water, let alone tea from... ...the house of a girl you've given away in marriage. I'm putting up at The Hotel Politana. Phone and tell me if your son liked the toys or not. Very interesting and over smart this relation of yours. - He's not my relation. I'll pour. - Where's everybody? Mother has taken Munna out. And father, to the doctor. I had come to meet him, in fact. He had to sign an agreement. I've barred you to play this game. It brings ill-luck! That means you've been lucky! - I've just offered a peanut today. - Congratulations! - Did the bird eat it? - Of course! What else will she do? It's golden. There's a lot of difference between this wealth and Madhavi's uncle's. - And what about Madhavi and me? - My darling... She a flower. You, a fruit. A flower's scent fulfills the heart. And the fruit sates hunger! A flower is smelt and discarded. But a fruit is good for health. Then my dear, fix me a drink with your own hands! I'll just get it. You're so enticing! I can forget everyone, but not you. What are your further plans? I don't think myself. I make others think for me! Madhavi's plans... ... will be known, tomorrow at 6 p.m.! Welcome Madhu... I mean, Poonam. - I knew you'd definitely come. - Why have you called me? Still playing a game of hide and seek with me? But honestly, how lovely you look in these white clothes! - Shut up! - Okay. Think my lips as sealed. And if you wish... - ...I'll keep silent forever. - What the hell do you want? I hear that your in-laws are worth 800,000 to a million! - What! - Actually it's not yesterday... ... that worries me, it's tomorrow. It's just that... Half the share is mine in the hand that you've played! I never thought you'd be so mean! But remember, I'll never let you succeed in this evil plan! Great! You weren't with me, even in true love. And now you want to turn away from unholy plans too? Don't shout! I'm told, even the trees have ears! Suppose somebody finds out you're not the real daughter-in-law? Let go of me! And if you try to meet me again, you had it! - Had you gone out? - Yes. Behind the compound. Near the lake. But why are you scared? I think there was a wild animal in the bushes. Possible. A wolf often visits that area. Yes. It was a wolf! Don't go alone there henceforth. Here are Rs.5000. Keep them safely with you. You keep it, mother. I'm going on a pilgrimage soon. Also, now it's your responsibility. Here. - What is it? - Nothing. I just wanted to ask... - Was the wolf small, or huge? - Why are you concerned? - Go and do your work! - All right. Why do you get angry? What's this? You've begun without me? Such desperation? You don't come, so... When did you come, my dear? This is Kamal's sister. My brother praises you a lot. But his praise falls short! - You're more beautiful. - You all sit. I'll get some tea. Some tea will not do. We're here for dinner. Period. My wife left on a pilgrimage today. Else you'd have met. Why did she take the trouble, when her daughter-in-law is an angel? - That's why I stayed back. - How long will you be here? - Till Holi. I've friends with me. - She'll bore you for 3-4 days! - What! I'll bore you? - They're going on a picnic tomorrow. - You join us too. - I don't go anywhere anyway. - And I'm not fond of picnics. - So what? Just give us company. This is once in a while. And you're always cooped up in here. - You'll like it also. - Very true. Now no excuses will do! - Why did you throw that flower? - I was just looking at it. Flowers look nice only at two places. At the feet of the Lord... ...and in a woman's hair. Not in every woman's hair! - May I ask something? - Yes. You were having fun some time back. It seemed your past was like this stream... bubbly! - And today? - Today? It's like this lake. Silent on top... ... but, with countless desires in its depths! In life, these depths of the lake are not everything. There is much more. Like... - ...these flowers that smile. - And wilt away too! - This evening that is enchanting. - And then gets lost in the dark! If you want to, you can get out of this dark... ... and touch the glory of the sky. - For that, one needs strong arms. True love is the biggest support in life. Hey... The stream is below and the picnic spot is behind. So, why look up? - I was watching a kite. - Kite? Trees are blossoming, flowers are glowing and the coffee-pot is steaming! - We came for you. - Let's go. Why did you prepare the coffee? We brought you here to have fun. - But I think you're bored. - Your brother's bored. - Do something about him. - Why, what happened? Insult! Are we so bad looking for him to stare at a kite in the sky? You're unbiased. You decide on this. It could be that some people like kites. As compared to us? Tell us, sir... ...what's so special in a kite for it to attract someone? Attracting someone is no skill. Getting closer to someone is. A skill that a kite possess. Colored like a rainbow. Having the flight of imagination. Sways in the wind, kisses the clouds. Agile as lighting. A beautiful dancer is a kite! Wonderful! Today I realized that a kite is a poem. What say you? A kite is not a poem. But he has made it one! Poetry is not made, it just comes. When somebody's beauty... ... reflects through the eyes, into the heart and stays there. Beauty is that which pulls anyone towards it, with its fragile string. Which intoxicates, and makes you forget everything. Like... ...a beautiful evening or a stream. This beautiful evening... drives me out of my senses. A string pulls me... drawing me closer to you. This beautiful evening drives me out of my senses. A string pulls me closer to you. Why do you keep a distance? Why don't you come closer to me? Your lips... don't ever thirst... it seems as if you're happily swallowing a poison. This beautiful evening drives me out of my senses. A string pulls at me, drawing me closer to you. When I begin to speak... why do you interrupt me? Why do your beautiful eyes admonish me? Your shyness and modesty... put a seal on my lips. This beautiful evening is driving me out of my senses. I seem to be pulled by a string and drawn closer to you. Like destiny that has fouled... you are quiet, like a picture. Your eyes give you away... and convey your feelings. This beautiful evening is driving me out of my senses. It's like a string pulling me, driving me towards you. There she comes. Come. Kailash has been waiting for you for hours. He said you had gone on a picnic. You're so lucky, Poonam. That you got such a fine father-in-law. Else, nowadays... ...who allows his widowed daughter-in-law to move so freely? I just wish that she be happy. That she enjoy herself. Else, she doesn't step out at all! Wonderful, sir. Such advanced thoughts! What brought you here? See, sir? Didn't I say she was still cross with me? Anyway, I came to do my duty. That too in Madhavi's name. Don't you remember? My wife. Your childhood friend. She writes in her letter that Aunt's pretty serious. - She's insisting that I take you. - I don't want to go anywhere! She can't go at present. My wife's away and I keep unwell. I forgot. Never mind. Some other time. She has sent an ordinary gold chain. - My wife has, that is, for Munna. - Why did she bother? I don't want the baby to wear any gold. Think, Poonam. It'll break her heart. She has got it blessed by the Lord. - If that's so, then take it. - Okay, if you say so. - Come and put it on him yourself. - Go. - Your baby is so sweet. - Don't touch him! Okay. Put this on him with your own hands. Listen carefully. I don't like you coming here. But I like to! When I have nothing to do with you, why should you come and go? - To continue the old ties. - I know your intentions very well. You want to defame me and take advantage... Excuse me. But you're also taking advantage of somebody's helplessness! Don't you feel sorry for me, at all? That's more like it! But my pity has a price, Madhu. I mean, Poonam. Pay the price and I'll vanish forever. And I'll never show you my dirty face again. Think it over. Shall I come again? No need! I've just 5,000/- on me. I was entrusted with it. But... Thank you! Believe me... if I was not in difficulty, I would've never troubled you. Really, how great you are! And I'm so lowly... You can go now. And don't forget your promise! I'll never show you my face again! Okay... Oh yes! Remember! Don't let anyone have this chain tested. Looks golden, but is of brass! Just like you! Actually Madhavi, but impersonating as Poonam! - Why are you laughing? - It's funny, that's why. You gave it so lovingly and she threw it away. No matter. I bought it lovingly, you keep it lovingly. A golden chain, and you gave it to me? Because I'm beginning to like you. But don't flaunt it. Else it'll arouse jealousy! I won't show it to anyone. I'll hide it in my trunk. - When will I see you again? - Why? Do you have a letter for... - Forget her! - Sis! Sis! Where are you? The milk is boiling over. - Whom were you talking with? - No one. I was shutting the door. Shut up! Liar! Give milk to the baby and serve food. Brother! I've brought you some coffee. - How long will you stay up? - Till my work is done. I went out... These papers are so important if I don't get them ready... Brother, had you a wife, she'd have pushed aside the papers... ... ordered you to go to bed, and said "You're to get up early". And you'd have hit the sack in a jiffy! Really? And if our mother was here, she'd have said... Son, if one unknown girl has let you down... ... and run away before marriage, why do you become a celibate? Who's becoming a celibate? Thank God she ran before marriage! Had she run after, then I'd have been humiliated even more! - Now, how did you like my friends? - They're nice. Very nice. Really? Then tell me whom do you like the best? Just take her name, and we'll have you married, like this! The girl who could become my life-partner is not among them. Then who is it? Whoever it is, I'll convince her. Dad's wish will be fulfilled and your life will be better. Who is she? Please tell me. Her name is... Shekhar's widow! A mother of a child? Are you mad? Are all the unmarried girls around dead? Or has she been luring you behind those widow's weeds? I would've never thought even... ...that my sister can't differentiate between muck and holy water! You may go! There is no desire... there is no emotion. What is my life after all? It's like a detached, drifting kite. There is no desire, there is no emotion. What is my life...? It's a detached, drifting kite. There is no emotion... From the skies, I once fell, my ties broken off. How has the world... how has the world plundered me ever since. I have no company, there's no one with me... what's my life, after all? It's a broken off, drifting kite. I have no emotions. O Lord of my dreams... what will I give you? I'm like the leaves of autumn... I'm a picture of tears. This is the real me. This is what I am. This is my life, after all... a detached, drifting kite. I have no emotions. - Did you call me? - Yes. These are the insurance papers. - Policy papers? - Yes. They've been redirected here. - Sign where they've marked it. - I have to sign? - Yes. They are on your name. - So? You sign, as his father. - This won't do in such matter. - But the thing is... I know how you feel. But you will have to sign! Sign them and send them to Kamal. He has contacts there... ...the work will be done quicker. Here you are. Now what will you do? Forge Poonam's signature? Know the consequences? Jail! Don't be afraid. Nobody knows me. You're Poonam now. Daughter-in-law of this home. This is your last responsibility, and you'll have to fulfill it. Don't forget, Madhu. You had given me your word. You had promised me! That's it, isn't it Madhu... Poonam. I just know this... ... that the move you've made, 50 percent of it, belongs to me! Break these bonds of helplessness. Your place is at your Kamal's feet. Tell him the truth and make your final decision. - Where are you off to? - I've been given these papers. - I'll give them to the driver. - Must be the policy papers. Let's see whether she has signed them properly. Here. Go give them. Man of my dreams, today I'm daring to... ...break my shackles before you. I want to come clean. You think I'm Poonam but in fact, I'm Madhavi. The same girl who brought misery in your life. I made my biggest mistake when I ran away from the pandal. - Your dinner's served. - I'm not hungry. What is it? You ate nothing in the morning too. Didn't feel like it. - Shall I make something else? - No. I've decided... ...that as long as I'm alive. I won't trouble anyone. - Go and rest. - What do you mean? I don't mind taking care of you. In fact I feel happy. Come and eat something. Come along. Sit. An old man is like an old wall. - Who should be very careful. - We depend on this old wall. For my sake. Don't be adamant. Eat something. She's feeding you like a baby. - She's force-feeding me! - Your papers have come. - You'll have to sign them. - Me? To verify her signature. Because they're always scared, the money may go to the wrong man. Even after all this, money always falls into the wrong hands. - I'll make some tea. - No tea. We've come to take you. - Me? - Yes. It's Holi in the village. It's a grand affair. Her friends are coming too. And they insist, you come too. - But how? - Why not? Didn't I say she'll refuse? No. It's not that. Father is alone. And... Uncle, we're going tomorrow. Please send her. When have I refused? She has her own will. - Let her go wherever she likes. - Come. Hurry up and get ready. Hey mister... it's the festival of colors. I'm not sparing you today... I'm not sparing you today, my love. I'll douse the colors on you. Even if your veil is drenched, or your blouse... I'm going to spray the colors on you. Each one has his destiny... ...someone laughs and someone sheds tears... ...if one drenches another in color... ...yet another wets her eyes with tears. Let the excuses be... what can the world do anyway? You're so naive... I'm going to play colors with you. I'm not sparing you today, my love. I'll douse the colors on you. Happiness has broken off its ties with me. Like a fire raging, left behind by gypsies. Grief is but a spark. With this spray... ...here come the revelers... to spray the colors. I'm not sparing you today, my love. I'll douse the colors on you. Even if your veil is drenched, or your blouse... I'm going to spray the colors on you. Why did you do that for? You'll wipe it? It was a signal from God. This red powder which is in your hair now... ...will shine forever as an omen for you to be a bride. Haven't you slept yet? When a young widowed daughter-in-law regales... ...then how can an old father-in-law sleep? I've been noticing that you're out to have a good time. How can you say that? They deliberately put color on me. - I shouldn't have gone. - If you hadn't... ...then how will this red powder have shone in a widow's hair? What kind of acid-test do you want me to undergo? - I want to know the real you! - The real me is my luck... ...which has taken away everything! And now, you want to use Kamal to set it straight? - What's this? - My letter! Yes! Your secret! Your betrayal, your deception! I thought you were divinely good. I gave you love thinking you were my daughter-in-law. I thought you'll be my support. Gave the child in your care. I handed over this household's prestige, money, everything to you! And you... you... ...betray me so badly? Why? Why? Tell me! - You want money, estates? - No... What the hell do you want? Happy Holi. You! And here? Leave it. There won't be any light. - I had pulled out all the wires! - Rascal! I couldn't see you out in the open so I hid here in the dark. You devil! You call it decency to hide in other people's room? Great! One thief expects decency from another one? Your father-in-law insulted me and threw me out! So I thought I'd go to someone who was my own. I know. You want to use my secret as a shield and loot these people. No! I came here today because it's Holi. A day for lovers. I don't want your wealth, but your heart now. You mean rascal! You want my heart, eh? You've burned my life to embers! Swept away all my desires like a blade of grass in the wind! But today all the veils drawn on my life are removed. Everybody has come to know who and what I am! I just wanted to start anew. Forget the past. Forget, eh? You lowly rascal! You want to mar the purity of a woman with your dirty motives! But there's still my decision! I'm going to brand your cunning eyes with this fire! These eyes must have ruined countless girls. Today I'll close these eyes forever! Have you gone mad? - What happened? - Nothing. Kailash was here. Him? He dared to do this? - I'll phone the police. - No! - Don't make it public, please. - Madam! Madam! He woke up screaming, and not quieting either. My darling! Go to sleep now. Don't cry. No, my darling... don't cry. Don't cry, Pappu. Please don't. I knew you'd try to go. But I'm not taking anything. The one whose memory you're taking with you... when he asks about you, What will I tell him? When the baby cries for you; when my wife will want to know. When people will ask why and where our daughter-in-law has gone? - What shall I say? - Tell them, the real one is dead. And the impostor ran off when the truth was revealed. But they won't believe it. They'll say, we maligned you... to save our reputation. We made up a lie! Then what shall I do? I can't bear it anymore. - I want to die! - You died that day... - ...when you came here as Poonam. - But that farce is over now. The farce may be over, but your life isn't! What's there to live for now? Everything. It's the same child who needs a mother's love. Same mother-in-law, who is on a pilgrimage having accepted you. And the same old me, who to save his family prestige... -... stand before you, imploring. - Father! Don't try to give a rebirth to Madhavi today. You came as Poonam. So be Poonam. Father, you've forgiven me? Get up, my dear. I won't go anywhere now! I thought you'd change your luck on Holi day. But you came, with your face burnt? My wounds will heal. But my heart will be mended when I turn her desires to ashes! Every jilted lover says this! Had I not told you about Madhavi, you wouldn't be so upset today. No. In fact you've done me a favor. You don't know my plans. I'm dying for that day... ...when the ashes of her hopes make you a bride! - Will that day ever come? - Yes! I know how to turn tables. This game of yours may prove to be a burden to me! I'm pregnant! - What! - Yes. - No! - It's true! This one truth can undo all our plans. All our dreams will be finished! We belong to each other, but we don't need a child now. We must consider your figure, youth and beauty... - ...till I grab that wealth! - Why don't you understand? You want kids, right? When the time comes, you will. But not now. Everything will be fine. - You'll be happy to know... - I know! I'm going to be a mother. But I don't want to be one. Why not? You may not be knowing, but I'm a dancer. if you were so fond of your profession, why did you marry? Life has its own compulsions. You'll have to help me. - I'll pay you whatever you say. - What! You'll pay me? You've come to the wrong place. My job is to give life, not kill! - You may go. - But... I said you may go! - What happened? - He refused. - But did you...? - I tried. But he refused to go against his principles for money. Don't fret so. I'll manage everything. You go on home. I'll go elsewhere and come. - Greetings, uncle. - Come in. I was awaiting you. Why did you send for me? You're keeping well, I hope. Old age is a disease in itself. Who knows about tomorrow? That's why I want to carry out one of my responsibilities. - Which responsibility? - My daughter-in-law. I often wonder what will happen to her after me? Don't say that. You're keeping well and we're no strangers to you. I wanted to hear the same from you. Isn't it possible, son... ...that some decent boy may accept her hand in marriage? You wish to get her married again? Yes. When I think of her, my heart is overwhelmed. God has been so unfair to her. - God widowed her in her prime. - May I say something, uncle? If a young man unknowingly puts red powder in a widow's hair... ... and if that girl has accepted, then can they both marry? Why not? If both are willing, of course they can wed. Well then, that boy is me. And the girl is Poonam! - Are you telling the truth? - Yes, uncle. I'll consider myself lucky, if you give her hand to me in marriage. What can make me more happy? Send a telegram to Vishnu today. I can't wait any longer. Go, son go. - Poonam... - You? Where were you? I was watching that falling kite. Where will it go? What will happen? What can happen? Someone will come forward and take care of it. Who knows? Gusts of the wind and branches may tear it to pieces. Never! Look! The gardener's son has claimed it. Now he'll retie it. Fly it in the open sky. It's his now. He'll never let it be cut again. - Even then, it'll be a felled kite. - So what? Nothing wrong with it. It is no less. She'll fly again on a new string. - With a new bondage. - Who'll bind with her? I will! Like that one, I'll also tie my kite with a new string. Your kite? You! Yes, dear. I wish to make you mine and give you a new life. I've opened my heart to uncle. He has asked me to wire my father. Everything will be fixed then. Uncle has accepted our love. - Really? - Really! No! You must be mad! Firstly, she's a widow. Then she has a son. Why are you doing this to me? Are you mad? Without weighing, and valuing, you're discarding such a divine girl? You keep her. Pray to her. Why are you... Come, my dear. This is Kamal's father. My dearest friend. Means more than a brother. - Bless you. - He doesn't take tea... - ...but hogs sweet-meats! - I'll just get some. Well? Got startled seeing such a lovely and decent girl? It's not that. I think I know her. - I've seen her somewhere. - You're right. She's not my daughter-in-law. She's your keepsake. What! - Yes. My daughter-in-law is dead. She's your friend's niece, Madhavi. But she had run away from the marriage-pandal. She has paid more than enough for that one folly. Here's the letter, she had written to Kamal. After reading it you'll know. She's as pure as the Holy water... ...and serene as the moonlight. We haven't done many virtuous deeds. Today we have a chance. Unite two separated souls and earn a blessing from God. - Does Kamal know this? - No, and he must never know it. It's better this secret remains a secret. Come, my dear. Here's your favorite sweet. - Come on, open your mouth. - You'll have to eat too, friend. - That's what I've got for you! - How you scared me! I'm scared too for now. That day she had thrown me out. - Suppose she sees me with you? - Dear sir... - That fear will soon go now. - How come? She's getting married to Master Kamal. - What? I've heard it too. It was fixed just today. Oh? Anyway... Look what I've got you. How lovely? Is it for me? Like it? Give me a hug then. And see what all I bring. - What a nice girl. - What are you doing, sir? Hide here, sir. What are you doing? Isn't the milk ready as yet? - Just cooling it. I've put sugar. - Give it to me. Please go now. My heart's hammering. Okay. But remember... keep quiet about it. - Why was that man here? - What man? Liar! Whom were you talking to? Why was he here? I don't know. He came and went. My wife has wired that she's coming in the morning. And I've asked Kamal to pick her up at the station. - Have your milk. - Later. Come and sit. I've to tell you something. I've written my will and bequeathed everything in the kid's name. - Good that you did. - And you're his trustee. - Me? - Yes. And as per this will, till he's 20 years old... ... all this estate, and its responsibility, is with you. Why just 20 years? It's my life-long responsibility. I know. But then I think this too. One day you'll get married and go to your own home. My divine daughter will go away from us. - How will we cope then? - Father... New ties need not break one's old ties. That's okay. But you'll have new joys of a new life before you. Those joys will not make you forget your Munna, will they? How can you say that? Munna is mine! And he'll always remain mine! I was hoping you'd say that. Today I'll sleep very peacefully. Give me the milk now. Father... Father... - What is it, Ma'am? - Nothing. Doctor, father is very ill. I'm lnspector Tiwari. Are you Mrs. Poonam? I mean Shekhar's wife. I was a sub-lnspector earlier. I've just come here from Lucknow. Where's Diwanji? - He's sleeping. - Never mind. It's urgent work, so I'll wait. - Sit down. - Thanks. Why hide from you? Somebody has tried to tarnish this family's reputation. - Who? - It's a woman. She claims you're not the daughter-in-law, but she is! - No! That's a lie. - You're right. But we've to listen to everybody. You'll have to come to the Police Station. - But... - Never mind. When Diwanji wakes, tell him. What's happened to him? I didn't get to speak to you. - How is he? - Actually, doctor... - lnspector! You, and here? - I had come to meet him. - Where is he? - In his room. Come along. Father! Oh Father! Go out please. You said he was sleeping. Tell everybody not to touch the body. Please come out of the room. You'll have to come to the Police Station with me. I'll have to take your statement on this issue too. - After some time may be? - You'll have to come now. Come, my dear. Till the body is not sent for the post-mortem... ...stand outside the room. And let nobody enter it. Come, let's go. Let's go, my dear. Sit, please. Don't be scared. Go and give your statement. I'll wait here till then. Now go on. - That jeep. Everything's okay? - What's the matter? Go in. I'll tell you. - Why are you crying? - Madam... Why don't you say something? Why is this constable here? Where have they taken Poonam? - Where's the baby? - What is it? - Last night, Shekhar's father... - What happened to him? - He has left us forever! - No! No! - You can't go in! - Get aside! Oh no! - It's a lie! I'm Poonam. - She's telling the truth. Come sir. We have a complicated matter here. She says she's the real Poonam, and not this one here. She's lying! I know her well. She's a cabaret-dancer. And such a cheap woman can never be from a decent family. I've already stated that I used to dance on stage. And that's why his father had broken his ties with him. Sure he had broken his ties, but that doesn't mean... ...any cheap woman can claim to be his son's wife. This is a plot. I'm Poonam. Munna's mother. I'm Kailash. I always said bad deeds always give bad results. Law caught up with you didn't it, Madhavi? Yes sir. That's her real name. She may be Poonam to you. But to me she was Madhavi and will always be so. I think it my duty to reveal the truth in the presence of Law. - Truth? - The truth is... ...she's not Diwanji's son's wife but my own wife! Liar! Schemer! Rascal! I've nothing to do with him. You scum! Aren't you ashamed to malign a decent lady thus? This is a police-station. How can I tolerate her being insulted? If he's telling the truth... ...then why didn't he tell Diwanji when he was alive? You can argue in the court. Let us get on with our job. - Carry on, sir. - As I was saying... we both were traveling together and she and her child were with us. - He's lying! - Please keep quiet! Go on. She told her tragic tale to her. They became friendly. Then we had an accident, and we both and her kid survived. I tried to find this lady, but I didn't find her. That very night my wife look her child and ran away. No, sir. Don't believe him. One has to believe the truth. I don't want anything. Just give me my baby. Patience. Inspector will return your child to you. When I came here, my doubt was proved to be correct. Madhavi was impersonating Poonam and eying the money. I told her... I reasoned with her, but she didn't listen. Actually... ... that's what we were fighting over that day, Kamal. His every word is a lie! He's taking some old revenge! These two are trapping me! Then what is the truth? The truth is that, the real daughter-in-law of that house... ...is dead! Now this case is even more complicated. Diwanji died, not of a heart attack, but poisoning! My wife can impersonate Poonam for money... ... but not kill! No, sir. It's a lie. Excuse me, but with present circumstances, she'll have to stay. Come. Murderess! What do you want? What farce you want to do now? I'm innocent... I'm innocent, I say. Go away! You made me a widow. You ruined my home. - Go away! Go away! - Be calm, please. Come, let's go. I thought your act was over. Why are you here now? The house which sheltered you, you broke that very house? Don't say that. He was like a father to me. - Please believe me! - Believe? And you? No. Not any more. I thought you were a Goddess. But you let me down. You hid the truth, and played with my emotions. Why? Answer me! What was the need? I know I've fallen in your eyes. Whatever I tell you... ...you won't believe it. I've never asked anything from you. But today, I ask just this... if you can, just wipe the stigma that I'm branded with! Take it easy now. Just be quiet. Who are you? Your real daughter-in-law. Munna's mother. Shut up! I've no daughter-in-law. I hate that word! Now get lost! Calm down. Let's go in. - Why are you here? - For the love of my son. Where was your love till now? Did uncle's death suddenly evoke it? She too must have some motive. Throw her out, I say! Hear that? Now get out. Okay, I'll go away. - This woman. Why was she here? - She is the one... ...who claimed to be the real daughter-in-law! This woman? She's a loose woman. She came for an abortion, but I threw her out! Such a woman can never be a daughter-in-law of this house! You think rightly. For I know, Shekhar's real wife is dead. Then why did Madhavi fool us by taking Poonam's place? To keep a promise given to her friend and to atone her mistake... ... she committed, unknowingly. What mistake? What atonement? She's the same girl you were to marry. - What are you saying, father? - Your uncle told me everything. - And that Kailash... - All lies! She's not involved with anyone. She's pure. And bright like a star. How strange! You knew it all. But why did not she tell me? She did! In her letter. Here, read it. It fell in your uncle's hands. He thought you'd hate her... ... so he hid it. He, who would've been the happiest... ... uniting you both, has gone to his Maker. And this poor girl is accused for it. How I wish I had got this letter earlier! Give the bottle, Pappu. What is it? He has a broken bottle, and he's not parting with it. Come here pet. Let's see... How's it here? I hadn't prescribed it. And it can be fatal too. Is it possible that this caused uncle's death? - Where did you find this? - Outside the kitchen's window. Coming sir. Last night, who gave uncle his milk? - I mean who had made it? - I sir. - Had anybody else come? - No, sir. Liar! Hadn't that man come? - Kailash? - Yes, sir. - Was Kailash here? - No... - You're lying! - No, sir. - You're lying! - Yes, he was here. He gave me earrings. And went away. I know nothing else. I'll come to know the rest myself! You! Won't you say anything? Or even talk to me? Won't you ask why I'm here? I got your letter! The truth came to light. I've come to promise you... ...that somehow I'm going to erase that stigma on you. It's too late now. I've nothing to live for now. I'm a liar; A branded-woman, I murderess! I can't bear it anymore. I just want to die! You never lived for yourself before anyway. You lived for others. Now you'll have to live for yourself. Just yourself! What do you think will be the outcome? Looks like we'll have all the wealth at our feet soon. You! - Why have you sneaked in here? - To meet Kailash. - But I don't live with her. - When did I say that? Anyway. I've some urgent news. Madhavi has confessed her crime. - Why did she do that? - To save someone. - Who? - She didn't say, but I know. - Who? - He who impregnated you! Don't shout! I have proof. Look! The photograph of the father of the child. You're accusing me and want to spoil my reputation. I've never seen this person in my life! Strange! You've never seen your husband, Diwanji's son, in your life? This is Poonam's husband. Diwanji's son, Shekhar! What? - Yes! This proves that you've no relation with that family! If you do have any relation, it's with Kailash here. You know too much! - Your intention isn't good. - Of course it isn't. - But our aim is the same. - What aim? Diwanji's wealth! For which you took her help to procure... ... and I, I used Madhavi! - You mean... The meaning is clear. Shekhar was my friend and I was trusted. When I went to collect Poonam and her child, she was dead! Then I met a destitute girl, Madhavi. I made her aware of parental love and the life of the kid. I put fear in her and under that pressure, she agreed. And the family accepted her as their son's wife. Then... ...I began to woo her. She needed love and support... ...and I, Diwanji's wealth! - I see. I know you're sensible. But whatever you've done, has undone my plans. And I'll never keep quiet while you enjoy all the luxury. - What do you want? - I'll keep everything to myself. - But on one condition. - What? 50 percent of Diwanji's wealth. Which is worth minimum 2 million! 2 million? - Yes! If I hint, that you're the real Poonam... ... then Diwanji's wife will accept you, and all the wealth will be yours! Agree? Think it over. I'll come again tomorrow. - I agree. - Let's shake on it then. - Let's celebrate on this. - I'll get it. - Who could it be at this time? - You both go in. I'll see. - But you... - God heard me. I'm innocent. But you had admitted to the crime. Yes. Only because... ... I didn't want to live with this stigma, but they got the killer. - And they acquitted me. - Killer? Which killer? The maid! She confessed that she had poisoned the milk. And she dragged you into it too. Said you gave her the bottle. - That's absurd! A lie! - May this all be a lie, but... ...I don't want you to get into trouble. I have nobody but you. Before the police come here, let's run away. Come on... - Take your hands off him! - So! You're still around, eh? You think you'll take him away from me by scaring and threatening him? By claiming to be the real Poonam, you've deprived me of everything! - Today I've come to claim my right. - You hated him till yesterday. - And now you talk of right and love? - And why not? He has stated to the police, that we are husband and wife. He said that for my sake. He can't marry anyone. He's mine. The father of my expected baby! We wanted to hear this from you. It's not so easy to fool the law. You're under arrest for murdering Diwanji... ... and for plotting to swallow his wealth! You too, Madam. What's all this? I'm innocent. I know nothing. He's right. He knows nothing. But for his information... ... I've taped his, and his mistress's statement. If you wish, shall I play it so that he comes to know too? The game is over. Take them both away! We caught a dangerous criminal today, thanks to you. And an innocent woman's dignity was restored. I don't have the words to thank you. - What for? The obligation you've done by removing the stigma on me... -..is something I'll never forget. - It's was no obligation, but duty. Sorry, but she'll have to come with me. But tomorrow you can bail her out. Come, madam. - Come in. - As per your word... But she's released. - I've come to take her. - But she has gone. - Where? - I don't know that... but she left this letter for you. My shadow has always eclipsed your life. So I'm going away. Please forgive me, if you can. Where are you going? I've come to take you home. Home? Whose home? Which home? The same house where you found shelter and peace of mind. Where you dreamt of Munna's future. Where uncle had decided to give you a new life. No, don't say that. Oh please don't. Yes, the same home where aunt's broken heart is begging for mercy. A home which was your in-laws' home, but now, your own. No! That's impossible. It cannot be... Break every norm and mores... come to me, draped in my love. Or else, I'll leave this very world. Where your memories torment me... I'd not like to spend a moment. The place where you do not dwell... I'd never set foot, my love. Subtitle synced by Grace.
