Good morning. Morning. What is that? Strawberry. I made breakfast. Really? What now? We could go to the park. Could you stop, please? Could we... Could we do that another time? Why? I just need some time for myself. Why? Because. That's why. Yes, but we had a good time yesterday, didn't we? -Yeah, sure. -Let's spend the day together! What's going on? I simply need a short break. A break from what? I have to think about everything. What do you have to think about? Well, if I want you. I don't get your fucking problem! Well, can you take your stuff, please? -Can you please leave now? -No! Can you please take your stuff and leave? No! Listen to me, damn it! You always pretend like you're supporting me. As if you'd say, "You can do it! You'll be fine..." -That's what I'm doing! -Yes! But it's all a lie when... I've been listening to your crap for years! I support you in every... No! You're not doing that at all... You're screaming at me, again! No! Do you know what the problem is, Sarah? I've had it! You suck the energy out of people! You suck the energy out of me! Shut up! Great! Who's going to pay for the window? Are you completely nuts? Sarah! Sarah! We've been through a lot of crap, but this shit is the limit! I've had it! I'm fed up! Hello. Hello? Deep-sea diver. Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Do you have a free seat in your submarine for me? I would love to see all the fish, too. Hello. Hello. I've got a small problem. I dropped my laptop and I was wondering if there's anything you could do? I don't think it's that bad. -You dropped it? -Yes. Okay. From where? A mountain? A skyscraper? Very funny. A table! All right. That's a first. To be honest, it looks like a total write-off. What about all of the data? That's really important to me, I work with this thing. To be honest, my boss is the Mac expert. However, if the hard drive is still somewhat intact, it would be quite inexpensive to remove it and to transfer the data. But if it's damaged it would be very expensive. Okay, so what does that mean? Around €2,000, depending on the hard drive. A new MacBook sounds cheaper! That's what I was trying to get at. And there's nothing you can do? I just don't want you to get your hopes up. But with this you can at least play table tennis, tennis, surf, baseball... I'm sorry! 5,800-metre cycling paths, just as I wrote, by two times minimum width. Minimum. 15-centimetre asphalt. 1,740, I got that, as well. Precisely. You got that. And I'd like to ask you to send me a proposal by noon tomorrow and I'll get back to you. The secretary just brought coffee. Okay, talk later, bye. Some people! -Well, I wanted to visit you. -That's sweet. Are you busy? You're bringing me coffee. So something's up. And here it is. My Mac is... I have to get it fixed, something's broken, and that's why. It fell off the chair or... No, from the table. I have a deadline in three days. Until then I have to finish my work, and if I get the job, the pay will be good. So you're doing a job for free to get a job? Well. There are still 10 people in the running. We'll get rich! I hope so. Lucky me, I already got the contract for the cycling path, and now you need a computer. Maybe I could work here somehow... How about this one? Do you want it? No, Sarah, that's not happening. Why not? I would sit here and... We'll both sit here. You bring the coffee. Hey, Dad... "I have to work for my design. My project. "I'm among the last 10." You can't possibly think that I'll give you the laptop. I don't want to have it... You can't possibly think that I'll give you anything to get your laptop fixed! Nothing! Not one cent! Nothing! Do you also sometimes feel different from everyone else? I don't know. We just had a drink, we fucked and the next morning everything was crap! I'm so stupid! -You slept with your best friend? -Yes, I did! -I'm such an idiot! -Yes, you are. Yeah, but you know... -Now I've lost my best friend! -No. He's definitely single. You should chat him up! I'll take care of these two. This is a singles' party. "Bandit looking for Bee." A flyer, here you are. Nobody fancies this shit! Look over there. There's a whole bunch of singles. I bet we're the only singles! Yeah, I already got rid of two! He just got me so worked up, I just wanted to punch him! So I threw my MacBook at him and it went right through the window. Wow. Good thing that you never overreact! Maybe you need someone who doesn't want to fuck you straight away. How? I can't say, "Hello, my name is Sarah. "I'm looking for a guy who doesn't want to fuck me straight away." What? I mean, it's always a good thing if a guy can be silly, for example. See, when men don't take themselves too seriously. Well, they can be faithful and... -Yes, but I never find those guys. -Yes, you will! They're not that far away. I've got an idea. Really? My aunt. What the fuck am I supposed to do with your aunt? Well, she has one of those... Yes? -Well, she does art stuff and... -Yes? Just come with me and I will introduce you. Why do you look like this? I'm a bee. And this is a chicken. I'm Sarah. You look more like a bumblebee. I'm glad there are no customers here. It's about the Asian artist you've got here. -Mrs Cheng. -Right. This Asian artist is looking -for a room to rent in Berlin. -No, it has to be a flat. But you always wanted a room. They are in two. Well, I need a flat now. If that was somehow possible, I would be delighted. Okay, and how much money would I get for the flat? €2,000. But you can't sublet your entire flat! -That's my new MacBook! -Yes, but where are you going to live? I can go somewhere else... I can sleep on a sofa for a couple of nights, or I'll go to my Dad's! Excellent! You're the best! Let's wait till you actually have it. I've got a new MacBook! Hello. This is Oliver from the computer shop. I've got your number from the bottom of your MacBook. I NOW JUST STOP DOUBTING Your MacBook is still in the shop. I've had a better look and wanted to ask you... Wanted to suggest that we could meet sometime. About the hard drive. I worked the last two nights on it. And dismounted it and tried to connect it, but there are a couple of things... It has to be completely restored. But I'm not the right person for that job. Unfortunately there's nothing I can do. I could find you something a bit cheaper. But you won't find anything under €1,000. Any chance to save the data? Not from my side. I really tried. I'm sorry. Can I invite you for lunch? To cheer you up or something? I can't today. I'm moving. Moving? Okay. Why? I sublet my flat. Because I need the money. Ah, so you're moving today. Do you have a rental car or a minivan? -Nope. -It's not a lot? I don't know. I'll find a way. -You know where to, though, right? -Yes. -Do you have a car? -No. -Do you need one? -Would be good. -I've got a car. -Really? I could help you. I'm free this afternoon. Would that be okay for you? -Yes, sure. Now? -Yes. Okay, I'm good to go. Moving, then, okay. -Did you paint this? -Yes. What was so depressing? I don't know. So, this is a woman? Yes. And this is an anteater? -Has that never happened to you? -What? Well, that you sometimes feel lonely, even when you're among people. -Sure. You have no idea. -Why? When do you have to be out of here? That's from my grandma. Where to, then? Just a moment. Yes. This is Sarah. What has that got to do with me? No, fuck you! I'm fucking busy right now... Are you kidding me? You're no angel! You're so innocent! First you want to fuck me, just like that... No! I won't apologise! I don't care! I'm coming round right now to put my furniture into your basement. Yes, right now! Here's the address. And you'll follow me on the bike? I'll see you there in about an hour. Okay, I can make that. Great. See you in a bit. I'll drive safely, I promise. Yeah, don't you dare breaking my stuff! The others are crazy, not me. Or maybe it is me... Who knows! What? So, I'm standing right in front of... Just ring the bell? There's someone there? Hello, I'm Oliver. I'm parking in the driveway with Sarah's things. Where to? Well, she said that she would come here herself. She asked me if I could help her out. She wanted to be here, but she's not feeling so well... I don't know. That's why she asked me. -Why doesn't she tell me? -I don't know. -Who are you? -Oliver. I'm going to call Sarah now. Since I don't know who you are. Sure. Call her. No problem. That's funny, the window. Great air conditioning. Yeah, I had a party last night. No, she's not picking up. May I ask how you've met? Sarah and me? That's a funny story, actually. She came in our shop with her broken laptop, and that's how we got to know each other. Ah, I see. -And you? -We've known each other for ages. We just met and you've known each other for ages... What do you mean? I don't know... You... You don't need to... I'm parked in a no-parking zone. Can't you do it on your own? Yes, of course. But where can I put her stuff? Maybe you can give me the key for the basement... No, no. This one is heavy. I'll do it. -Let me help. -No, I'm fine! Impressive! -Could you just... -Sure. Surprise! Are you mad? It's 11:00 p.m. -Yeah? -Quiet! What do you want? Can I sleep here? -What? -Can I stay? I got a new laptop. Quiet! How did you do that? I managed to get €2,000. -Managed to get? -I'm subletting my flat. -That's great. -I know. That's what I'm saying. You're getting 2,000 for just one month? That's brilliant! Not one month, four months. And then I've still got 80 plus per month. You are a real math genius. Well. That's €320 for four months. That's brilliant! That's €2.50 per day. And who moved in there? -Some artists. -Artists? You didn't get a loan, did you? You got the money? Yes, I've got the money. How much did it cost? One-seven. So I've still got 300 for the upcoming rent. But you do realise this is kind of stupid. I needed the money. You didn't help. I had to find a solution. To work as a hooker can be a solution, too. Would you like a cup of tea? And that's what I'm working on. Cool. Is that the new cycle path? See the lanterns? Awesome. Looks a bit like London. Why London? Are you asleep yet? We've got a lodger. Sarah is staying for three days. What? Sleep well. Sarah is going to sleep here? -Yes. -Oh no! Dieter! It's only for three days. -Is she here already? -She's sleeping. No. Not now. It's not that bad. It's only for three days. But Dieter... I just need some peace and quiet now. What about me? -I'm here. -Yes, but so is she. I am the lovely Dieter. -You and her. I can't wait. -It will all be peaceful. We'll see. What's wrong? Why are you looking at me like that? Sarah. Natascha and I are expecting a baby. How about "Congratulations"? Nobody expected you to be happy about it. How long is this supposed to go on? -What? -Your stay with us. Until I found a new flat. That can take some time. What she didn't tell you is that she sublet her flat. You said it yourself. "Do something," and I did. This is the solution of a retard. You always throw a big tantrum! Because of your behaviour! This is such a beautiful occasion, and you are being stroppy! Stop nagging at her. That won't help. So I'm the bully now? Take your elbows off the table! I can sit how I want to! All of this needs to be cleared away. There's no harm in supporting us a little! I'm not your maid, okay? -You're a guest here and... -Yes, I'm a guest, so leave me alone! Listen. You didn't even comment on Natascha's pregnancy. You'll get a sister or a brother. Great, what am I supposed to do about it? Jump around and clap? You did that all by yourself? I'm not sure about this edge right here. I might smooth it over more. Look here, all these gaps need to be done individually... For me? Thank you! The two of us, alone together. And only the fish and the stars can understand us. All right, open your eyes! Here you go. There's a surprise underneath the cream. And... And you've got everything done, right? Have you found a proper place? What's the name of the lake? -Don't you know? -Nope. This is Oli's lake. It's my lake. All of this is mine. My ducks, my trees. All mine. It says nature reserve only to keep the people away. How's the project coming along? Doing well? Yes. Well, it's lovely you came by. Actually, I don't have that much time. But you do need a break occasionally. Great. Want some cream? No, you can have more. You should have more cream! I really don't... You don't smile enough. Do you know Joker? You want me to "Joker" you? "Why so serious?" Hello. Are we out of drinks? Could you please put some clothes on? Why? Oh, crap! -Come on, Sarah! -What are you preparing? -Excuse me? -What are you preparing? A quiche. Please put some clothes on! You are a woman. What's the problem? This is not a hippie commune here. -Come on, don't be pathetic. -Dieter! That's unhygienic. Put your foot down. -What now? -I don't know. I really don't. -Excellent, well done. -So? Well done. Come down, you little monkey. Get dressed. -Come on, Dad. It's boiling hot outside! -Yes, sure. And get dressed! We are going shopping. You're really square sometimes! Unbelievable! We are out of drinks. It's so hot. I'm going to go shopping in a moment! You can help me. I have to work. -Don't you want to come? -I can't. I have to work. And then work some more. And work some more... I want to join. Great. Really hungry! Who are you writing to? Who is Oli? The guy who tried to save the data from my MacBook. Did he manage? No, he didn't. Oli is cool anyway. I'm up here. Can you see me? Here, all the way at the top. Alone in my spaceship. Hello... Hello... Deep-sea diver... Hello? -What's going on? -I handed in my design! Congratulations. That's great! I don't like these zombie games. Well, if you only play it for half an hour you can't grasp the deeper meaning of the game. Yes, but it's so beautiful outside. Yes, I got all dressed up and came out with you. I'm just saying that the deeper meaning of these games, the statement, the actual story, you know, the storyline and the graphics... You could... You could... Are you okay? -You should try this! -Next time. Come on! Great. I got all dressed up for you. Do you want to play catch now? Sarah, it's nice over here. I mean... Shall we go for some ice cream, or to the movies? Come on, up you go! I'm up! -Now come back down! -I prefer you coming up! Oh, shit. Is there any wine left? Do you always have it there? -Do you want some? -Why not. Some lipstick. Looks really good on you. This is Daphne, and this is Jade. It's not fair that I only kissed Daphne. I'm sorry, Jade. You don't see anything. Good morning. I made breakfast. What's your name? What are you doing in my bed? Drink something. Oh, it's Coke. That's what I'm saying. Wow, all of my... Pretzel sticks with mustard. My favourite breakfast! Would you like some? You didn't have any honey. Shall we watch a movie? -Yeah, The Shining. -No, it's too scary. You have to watch it properly. It's more like a romantic comedy. A romantic comedy? Jack Nicholson as the crossed-in-love husband... Working? -What are you doing? -Nothing. What are you watching? I'm watching nothing. -Why so grumpy? -I'm not. Where is Natascha? At the movies with a friend. Please leave it. You're late! I was out. I said I was out. You come home and get on my nerves. On Sunday we'll have coffee and cake here. Natascha is trying a new recipe. And I want you to be a part of it. That's just great. -Can I count on you? -Yes. Is the cake tasty? Close the door! I'm just locking up. -Hungry, hungry... -I have to lock up first. Come on, hurry up, man! What would you like? I think I'll have chicken. I think I'll have chips. It's a series in real-time which portrays an apocalyptic world where the few survivors are trying to struggle through. The second season is not that great... -How would you feel about... -Feel about what? Me moving in with you? Eh, no. I mean, you can always crash at my place, but... We've only known each other briefly. Is it that bad, staying with your Dad? We've run out of chips. -Yes, we're out. -We need more. Okay, we'll get some. Let's do something this weekend! And you could spend the night... I've already got an idea. -What is it? -It's a surprise. Okay, let's get some chips. And I'll be surprised. Knock, knock, knock! Hello. This is Oli. Hello. Dieter. -What? -Dieter. I'll fetch another plate. -Please, do come in. -Thank you. This way. -I didn't know you were not alone. -Me neither. -Who is this? -That's my father and his wife. -Ah, now that's a surprise. -Yes. Awesome. -Sarah? -What? Who is that? This is Oliver. -Who? -We met the other day. Why is he at our family coffee? -He's part of this! -I've never seen him before. How can he be part of anything? He looks like a junkie! A junkie? You've got to be kidding! He's dressed like a hobo! You really are crazy! So, Oliver... What is it you do for a living? I'm a computer specialist, as they say. -Computer geek. -A little bit, I admit it. And what exactly do you do? -For me? -You have your own shop? I'm an employee in a small shop. -Coffee? -Sure. Anyone else? -No, thank you. -Natascha is pregnant. Congratulations! And congratulations to the Dad, of course! You should take a page from his book! And where do you live? In Friedrichshain. I'm renting. There are people who pay rent. Others rent, and then sublet... -Dieter. -... then they go to other places... You know. -Want some chocolate? -Yes. I have to get her affection somehow. She has to like me for something. So this is what exactly? Is this a relationship? Or is this a fling? We'll see. There you go. Women know this stuff better. That's why I'm asking Sarah. Well? We're fine. -Are you lovers? -Maybe. We like each other. Could I go to the loo, and then get a glass of water? -Shall I grab something for anyone? -No. -Yes. Bring back some milk. -Of course. The red towel is the guest towel. Are you sleeping with him? Of course I'm sleeping with him. Not exactly tasteful. That's your opinion. -You've had better. -Dieter, that's none of our business. Somebody spilled some milk. Coffee? Anyone? Very impressive, Oli. Good. Honey! -"Honey." -Awful! I was joking. Since I'm allowed to meet your Dad today. Well, it was supposed to be more like a family thing... -I didn't know that. -Me neither. What did Sarah say? She said it was a surprise. "Come with me!" But it's a nice... I mean... Nice! It seemed like a good occasion for you guys to meet. Thank you, again. It's really tasty! Really? Do you want another piece? All right, one more. Are you all right, Sarah? So-so... What's wrong? I didn't get the job. -What job? -What job? Did they just let you know? They don't have a clue. I've looked at it. It was really good. They're clueless. Got to have the right connections, and off you go... I'm always out of luck. That's so unfair! Rubbish! These things happen... You've done well. You tried, you've failed. Let it go. It's done! Maybe it's time for something new! Something new? Maybe an apprenticeship. You would earn some money... I want to finish my studies. You could take a break from graphic design. Your dad has a point. Nowadays even 16 year olds do graphic design. It's a dead end. I want to do this! There are a lot of things that people want to do. But you have to be realistic and earn some money. I'm doing everything I can! I'm trying really hard! That's exactly the point. Trying is not enough! You have to really go for it! Could you just stop, please? I think your dad is trying to say... Stop stabbing me in the back! Maybe you should compromise, till you solved your money problems. But she's really talented, Dieter! Okay, I get it. I'm always the fuck-up! Don't you understand that I... Stop it! That I want to do something I care about! I don't take joy in moralising. And to be the evil dad! It's not exactly normal, your behaviour, right? Take charge of your life and get some results! Instead of handing out some flyers! I am trying! -Dieter, it's... -Oliver, please. That's not enough! Stop trying, and do something! Sarah is doing something. Please stop, I can't take it any longer! "You have to do this! You have to do that!" I want to do something I'm passionate about! And no shitty apprenticeship! I too want passion... It's no hobby! I will earn money with it! Come on! Be realistic. It's a hobby! Listen to me, god dammit! Stop beating the table! -Kiss my ass! -I beg your pardon? Just leave me alone! Bye. Good luck... And all the best for the pregnancy. Sarah! How are you? I just lost my job! Technically you didn't lose the job because you never had it. Can I stay with you? See? What do you mean, "See?" I called you 40 times. Are you crazy not to pick up? Stop it! -Daddy, please! -Are you drunk? Are you on drugs? Answer me! Where have you been all night? Let go of me! Is this how you thank me? Coming and going as you please? You're a disgrace! Can I stay with you? Why doesn't she call? Because she is mad. -You think she is with this Oliver guy? -Hopefully. Come on, he's okay. He's all right. Seeking Room!! Where have you been staying? You know. I... I just don't understand you sometimes. Because you're so... One day you're the best dad in the world, and the next day you are completely different. I don't know how to deal with that. Sometimes I don't understand you either.
