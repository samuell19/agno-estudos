SEVEN DAYS OF GRACE Damn! Damn! Ku rrat? Why Ku rrat? Oh, it's you, Doctor! Could you shine that light over here for a moment? Thanks. What made you think it was Kurrat? Already the second trip this week! In that case, I'd call an electrician. An electrician? Rather the police! I can't see why the police should worry about an electrical trip, Muhl. Lunzmann? Lunzmann? What's this masquerade about? Where are Kurrat and Sickelcka? - Well? Where are they? - l... Lunzmann can't help you, he's sleeping. - l... - Well? - I don't know. Come on, don't just stare at me. I've been sleeping. "Sleep, the most delicious of inventions." "William Ratcliff" by Heinrich Heine, 10th scene. Correct, Genschke. But I'd prefer to know where Kurrat and Sickelcka are! Very well. I'll talk to you tomorrow. Oh, to you as well, Lunzmann. Lucky for you, you've kept your mouth shut! Luck! They'll catch you one day, assholes! Watch out, Genschke. You're in it too! l'm sleeping. l'm sleeping! I don't know anything! Say, did you notice anything unusual? Notice? What? Where? Some of our proteges are on the fly. - How many? - Four. Well, that's just a trifle. Last week, seven were missing. Are you actually saying that this happens frequently? Are you saying you didn't know? Anyhow, you seem to know more than me. All the better for you. That way, you'll spare yourself a lot oftrouble. - Trouble? - Yes, trouble. Endless interrogations, embarrassing questions, impudent lies. And in the end, you're always the one who's hoaxed. You know I mostly tolerate your special ideas about discipline, Fromm, but don't you think we should sometimes remind ourselves of the responsibility we took from the parents? Oh, very nicely said, Hendriks! Well, I guess I'll have to talk to the headmaster. You want to squeal, Hendriks? Kurrat needs a different treatment. But why do you think it's Kurrat? I know my chaps! Good night. Come on, Kurrat, give up! We're freezing our asses off! If you don't want to, beat it! I didn't force you to come along. Come on! Come on, guys! Well, have I promised too much? Make yourselves comfortable, guys! Self-service is customary here. No inhibitions! If you go wide in here, it's your own fault! Damn, this is a real jerk-off theatre! - How many are you tonight? - Me, Hensen and two novices. Gosh! May I introduce: the blue angel of Kuttevorde, my friends, Mangold "The Tomtit" and Hein Sickelcka. Let's gamble, boys! Every time you throw a six, you'll get 20 bucks. Six! Six! - Six! - You cheated! - What do you mean, cheated? - It was a four, not a six. Cheater! - But I paid! - That doesn't matter. - Stupid game! - Why did you invite this fart-stopper anyway, Kurrat? He's spoiling our whole party! In Las Vegas, they wouldn't let you in, Tomtit! Give this to me, you blackleg! Cut the kitty's tail off, don't cut it completely off, leave her a little stump, so she can go to church! Now, be good! Sweet, lovely and good! Show me what you can do! Six! Oh boy! - Now, let's party! Off with Tomtit's clothes! - No! No! Let go of me! No! Another night-exercise! Where were you? - Me? - Who else? On the loo! I went to the loo! Today I saw him! Who did you see? Ku rrat. So? Tomorrow, I'll report him to the headmaster. No, you won't! Got it? You won't! You still owe me an explanation. Come on, Kurrat, out with it. What happened last night? I could also ask Lunzmann. Or Genschke. - But I'd rather hear it from you! - I don't know anything. Maybe you'll remember. I bet you'll remember it. Haven't you, haven't you got, a woman in stock, or not? Yes, yes, yes, we've got various in stock! - Prefer an elegant one? - Yes, yes, yes! - Perhaps a fat one? - Yes, yes, yes! - How about a queer one? - No, no, no! - I should think so! - No, no, no! Can she... But of course she can! You can all now prove that your good mood can't be spoilt by anything. Sickelcka, dispense them. We'll write an essay. - Typically Fromm. - Yeah. 'The skin as the receptacle of the emotional tools.' Mangold? Yes, Mr. Senior Lecturer? I'm glad to hear you're enjoying the topic. Have you gone crazy? Go, beat it! At last! What d'you mean, at last? At last, he's getting his just deserts! Fromm must've gone mad! I wouldn't have done that if I were you! Say that again! I wouldn't have done that if I were you. I can have my son beaten by any ostler. I don't need an expensive private school for that. But please! The presence ofthe entire faculty should demonstrate to you that this outburst of unfortunate, misdirected anger - is unanimously disapproved of! - I'm not quite squeamish and I think that sometimes, slaps are a legitimate means to make a young person self-reflect. But this incident... I'd rather talk about an accident! This accident doesn't fit in with my ideas of a self-controlled, unbiased guidance of human beings! The behaviour of Mr. Fromm is very simply explained: He's very attached to his dog. And I'm very attached to my son! Excuse me, Mr. Kurrat! Please consider that Mr. Fromm is a personality who is, well, highly respected by all of us. You of all people are saying this, Mr. Stallmann? - What's taking Fromm so long? - He'll come any moment. What I think is a side issue, Mr. Stallmann. It's not about me, but about the boy. After all, we want to normalize the disturbed relationship between student and teacher. Otherwise, there will only be 'either' and 'or'. And I'd say the 'or' largely depends on Mr. Fromm. - But apparently, he's avoiding me. - Not at all. I've just apologised to your son, Mr. Kurrat. That's why I'm late. Mr. Fromm, Mr. Kurrat. Please take a seat. Now you know that I've apologised to your son. Mr. Kurrat, I'd like to say that I regret the incident very much. And for my part, I'm willing to forget everything. But, Mr. Fromm, only the one who's been treated unjustly can express a will to forget. Besides, there might be a will to forget... but a duty to forget... doesn't exist. How am | to interpret this? Ladies and gentlemen, I'll pass these silly slaps over in silence. However, if you don't mind, - I'd like a short talk with Mr. Fromm in private. - Sure! Mr. Kurrat, please accept the thanks of our faculty! You may retire, fellows! - Fromm, of all people! - You've no idea. - I bet he'll draw in his horns now! - But they sure did the dog a bad turn! - I would've done the same thing! There he comes! - Say, what happened? - Nothing. He apologised. - Better than nothing. - And what will you do next? Why next? He apologised! Come on, Kurry, don't be so hypocritical. You're after his neck, I can smell it! - Mr. Kurrat! Your father wants you! - I'm coming. 'Mister' Kurrat. Did you hear that? 'Mister' Kurrat! But the Mister still needs backing! Well, surely it's nice to have such a rich daddy! And you only shoot your mouth off when Kurrat isn't around. Asshole! The element beryllium was discovered in 1809 in the mineral beryl. Beryl would be polished to produce an early form of spectacles. This is why we call them 'Brille'. [German for 'glasses'] Beryllium is... Pretend as if nothing happened. Don't let anyone notice. I'll call you when I'm home. - Well then, goodbye son! - Bye. - Hello, Kurrat. - Hello, Mr. Senior Lecturer. Beryllium is an earth alkali light metal which, if added to alloys, ensures great hardness. Only the 1000th part ofthe earth's crust consists of beryllium. lf coloured green by chrome sediments, we know beryl as emeralds. Blue-green beryl is known as aquamarine. Beryllium is becoming increasingly significant in astronautics. It's used as a structural material for space capsules and rockets. Its high elasticity and its enormous ability to cope with pressure immunize the highly complex control systems against external influences. What does gunpowder consist of, Lunzmann? - Of... of... - Hensen, help him! Of saltpetre, sulphur and wood charcoal, I believe. Who invented gunpowder, Genschke? lnvented by the Chinese around 1170, later by Berthold Schwarz, after whom it was named. Lunzmann, come to the blackboard! Write! 1. Who had intended to provoke Fromm? 2. Who executed this nonsense? 3. Which punishment would be most suitable? I expect answers to these questions within 10 minutes. I'd also suggest opening the windows. Ku rrat? Yes? - I congratulate you. - For what? For your father. We had a long conversation. I know. I'd like... to resume it with you, if you like. Perhaps in the afternoon? What time? Something forms, in certain situations, under certain conditions, under inscrutable laws. You don't know how, but suddenly, it's there. - What are you talking about? - These crystals. Do you like the photographs? It's strange, but what you just said... almost sounded like one of your pedagogical manifestos. What are you trying to tell me, Hendriks? That we can only conquer the world between the 16th and 20th years of age. - We? - Well, you, me. All of us who dedicate ourselves to this profession. Come on, this is utopian, pedagogical blabber. I don't want to conquer the world. Not anymore. - Why did you become a teacher then? - Because I enjoy building up young people. So that one day, they'll bite themselves through, make their way without losing their courage and their minds. Even ifthey get slapped unjustly. That's what you wanted to hear, isn't it? 'Part of a proper education is teaching people how to marvel at something.' My goodness, did you write that, Hendriks? No, it's by Huxley. And if one's to believe him, you're an excellent teacher. You made the students marvel! And me as well. Come, Hendriks. Just look outside. Actually, they're wonderful little beasts. Smart and lusty for life by nature. And we do everything to dissuade them from it. - I'm sorry but I've an appointment with Fromm this afternoon. - Fromm? Yes, with Fromm. Down at the water gate. Don't forget that! - And what about Genschke? - I'll leave him to you. Castrate him, if you want to! Lunzmann! Pick it up! Pick it up! What are you staring at? Beat it! Don't you touch it! That fellow has treated you like this for long enough! Ku rrat! I advise you one thing: Pull yourself together, otherwise I'll tell everyone what a bugger you are! - | suggest you apologise. - What for? - If you're a man, you'll apologise. - Not now... Please. Now. Right now. No! No! Let go of me! ldiots! Scumbags! Dirty pigs! - Why did the headmaster relocate you into our room? - I don't know! - Did he ask you to spy on us? - Ask him yourself! - Did you squeal on Kurrat to Hendriks? - No! I didn't! Leave him alone. Maybe we're wrong. You pigs! Pigs! So the commissioner asked, 'But who, if not Genschke?’ I saw what you did to Genschke. What did you see, Mrs. Muhl? How we took a shower? And how we washed our backs? And our little magic sticks? But dear Mrs. Muhl! Did you enjoy it? For girls, this area is forbidden, forbidden, forbidden. Don't worry, Mrs. Muhl, we won't tell anyone! Well, as I said: your father is a successful man. Quite so. A man who obviously knows his aims. He knows what he wants and what he doesn't want. Your father told me that you get along with him very well. It became like this after he got divorced. At times, I'd also wished for a father with whom I could talk about everything. About everything. At least about essential things. What do you mean? Well, he doesn't need to know every little thing. lt'd just make me nervous. But your father was also educated at a boarding school. Do you really think he stayed there every night? Why didn't you report me? It would've been your duty. There are things about which one keeps silent, you know? Who told you about it? Genschke? - Why do you mention Genschke? - Why did I mention Genschke? There's no reason. Just like that. I'm finished here, Mr. Senior Lecturer. Can we go now? Yes... Why do you look like this? Well, what do I look like? Why are you painting yourself? - Why not? - But we... We've gotta go to the basement. The heating. We have to. We have to. Have you ever thought about who you are, Muhl? Have you ever thought about what you've become, Muhl? Do you ever think about where you are going? Have you gone crazy? Twice a week, you take the bucket, scrubbing the urinals for the students! And here you are, standing in front of me, asking 'Why are you painting yourself?' Shall I tell you something? It makes me vomit! But... you'll excite the students! That's good. Very good, actually. And better than the other way around. Yes? Yes. Yes. I'm coming. - Kurrat is gone! - At last! - He disappeared! - All the better. You haven't seen anything or heard anything, nor do you want to talk! - I thought you were a friend of his, Lunzmann? - Yes. And nevertheless, you haven't the faintest idea where he is? - Maybe... - Maybe what? Maybe he just went for some fresh air? - And you, Sickelcka? - I swear to god the almighty... Sickelcka! We've neither the time nor the spirit for your nonsense! - Have you got any idea? - I swore! - Yes, perjury! And Genschke was probably sleeping as usual, right? - Yes, Mr. Hendriks. - Even though you're such a bright boy, who usually knows about everything. Alright. I guess we've got no choice but to inform the police. Perhaps we should wait a little longer before calling them. It might just be a silly hoax. - We know Kurrat well enough. - As usual, I agree with you, dear fellow! Thank you. The scandal we'd provoke by calling in the police - might be bigger than its cause! - Alright. But we need to inform his father. Please look up his number, will you? Here. This is the automatic answer machine for number 47-56-89. Mr. Kurrat is not at home. The number of his office is 24-12-86. What's so funny, Tomtit? - You know how many expressions there are for it? - For what? Come on, don't be silly! For the thing, of course! - Don't you think that's useless? - Here, there's a complete list: Kicking, banging, stuffing, bonking, brushing, fiddling, rubbing, balling, pushing... Can't you wait till I'm finished? Hammering, nailing, screwing... - If you want to become a carpenter, what do you need A-levels for? - ldiot! What an idiot! May | see this vocabulary book for a moment? Keep your seat. - B...but carpenter is an honest profession! - Sure. But since you'd like to be the elite ofthe country, you'll write me a nice, little essay for tomorrow... About the shifting significance of sophisticated vocabulary in our common speech. By the way, that list is rather incomplete! Never mind that hoax theory! I'm seriously concerned! We have to assume that something has happened to Kurrat! - I believe you're too negative! - At any rate, I think it'd be negligent - to procrastinate over calling in the police any longer! - Isn't this a private school? - And thus, our private responsibility is even bigger! - Fromm... I believe we mustn't beat around the bush any longer. - Well... we need to tell them about it. - Tell what? I intended not to trouble you with this triviality. There are no trivialities concerning this business! Very well, maybe it's a hint and we'll find Kurrat without bothering ourselves with the police. This wouldn't be the first night that Kurrat didn't spend at the school. - And you haven't told me before? - Kurrat wasn't the only one. The lady's name is Lonny... - and she's quite 'sexy', as they say. - Mr. Fromm! I'm seriously outraged! lt would've been your duty... I teach chemistry and biology. What the students learn at night isn't my responsibility. So the lady's name is Lonny and she's quite 'sexy', as they say. And from fall to winter, she's more or less living offthe boarding school! And now, gentlemen, I'd like to know what happened there, how often you went there and who let you back in. Lunzmann? Hensen? Mangold? Sickelcka? - Genschke! - I never went with them! - Aha! So you never went with them, but you knew and lied to my face! - May | interrupt for a moment? - Yes? I'd say we should concentrate on Kurrat's disappearance. Genschke... - Has Kurrat perhaps gone to see this Lonny? - I don't know! - I really don't know, but... - But? Well? Kurrat owns a tape recorder. He recorded everything that happened - during these... - Speak up! These "gents' parties" and all that! And... where is this recorder? I think this is invading the privacy of the students. Muhl! Go upstairs with Lunzmann and fetch this recorder! Cut the kitty's tail off, don't cut it completely off, leave her a little stump, so she can go to church! Now, be good! Show me what you can do! Six! - Now let's party! Off with Tomtit's clothes! - No! No! At night at madam's boarding school, there is a lot of drool about, The rector is called Raguse and at night he opens the packages from Flensburg, sent by 'Uhse'! [German sex shop chain] Outrageous! There's no use in listening to this nonsense! - We said 'A', I think we should also say 'B'. - I think so too. Muhl! Take the boys into the corridor! - 'Nobis bene, nemini male'. - What's that supposed to mean? Mr. Meinke shares my opinion that the students should remain here. At Madame's school there's a lecturer, who liked to do it once in a while! He invited Miss Gabert and read Goethe's divan poems with her, that made him feel much better! The metre isn't right, Sickelcka! And then there was another lecturer who also had his problems, he liked to see beautiful boys. Alas, the boy went to the village where he was eaten by the ravens. Enough! We won't listen to this scandalous talk any longer! Go back to your rooms and hold yourselves at our disposal! And I advise you to come back with answers to my questions! Hensen? The last verse... Wasn't that your voice? Yes or no? Yes. So you know neither Kurrat, Hensen nor Mangold and Sickelcka? And of course, you know nothing whatsoever of these so-called "gents' parties"? But I'm sure you can imagine what will happen if we... call in the police. Mangold, for instance, hasn't even turned 16 yet. - But I thought you were from the police! - I'm a teacher. Pauker! [Common for teacher] Yes. Yes, Pauker. But now, I'm looking for Alfred Kurrat and I've been led to believe - that he stayed here on the night in question. - But I told you that... And what's this? Have you been working at the boarding school for long? So you've forgotten to whom this scarf belongs? I've never seen you here. And you hardly will see me here. l stimulate myself on another level, different from my students. So... When was the last time Kurrat came here? - Want a cigarette? - When? Three days ago. And you haven't seen him since? Think carefully of what you'll answer. Bloody Christ! You're acting as if he was murdered! Lunzmann! Are you crazy? I thought you had curfew. - I need to talk to you. - Alright, what about? About... About Kurrat. He... he told me that he'd meet with Fromm at the water gate. And what's so remarkable about that? Since then... Since then, Kurrat's been missing! But that's just ridiculous, spiteful student gossip! - Why are you exaggerating it? - I'm not exaggerating, Fromm. But after all, you were the last person who saw Kurrat. You're not suspecting me of murdering him, are you? First a few slaps, then genuine homicide? Come on, Hendriks! Actually, I'm driving at something entirely different. Oh yes? Supposing Kurrat wants to play a bad joke on you? Hendriks, your astuteness has a naive smack to it. I'm just trying to put myself in his place! You're not shying away from anything, not even psychology! - Apparently you've got no desire to calm me! - Are you nervous? - Yes. Because of you, Fromm! - Thank you. - But there's no reason to be. - You really think so? I think you should silence those rumours circulating about you. Oh, Hendriks, you're really wasting your good intentions on the wrong object. For instance, Stallmann would be a better victim. Unlike me, he's actually hurt by the rumours about him. - You mean Hensen's story on the tape? - Among others. Oh, that's just a cheap act of revenge! You mustn't forget that Stallmann has given Hensen pretty bad grades in physics. If it was just an act of revenge, Hensen has done a good job. Stallmann's nerves are on the edge. Stallmann? Stallmann? Stallmann! How many of those have you taken? Just a tranquilizer. No need to worry. Stallmann! You need to pull yourself together! If I'm not mistaken, this is Kurrat's camera bag. - How did it get here? - A significant question, Hendriks. Of course, it means that Kurrat has been here in the meantime. After he met me at the water-gate. See how easily you can deceive yourself? Stallmann... Stallmann, when was the last time Kurrat came to see you? In the afternoon? In the evening? The evening before he disappeared? Stallmann, Stallmann, what on earth's the matter with you? Why didn't you tell us? Because it's nobody's business and... because... because... because I can't talk about it. Are you aware that this resulted in the gravest suspicions against Mr. Fromm? What did Kurrat want that evening? Did he say something? Isn't it rather unusual for him to come to you at this late hour? What's so unusual about it? What? Is it so unusual that a student... that a... that a student... has confidence in his teacher? I'm sure he didn't mean it like that. I must ask you to stand in for Dr. Hendriks. He went to Hamburg to find out the whereabouts of Kurrat's father. I'm more than just embarrassed. You know that l... Come in! - A visitor, Mr. Rector. An urgent one. - But I told you... The police, Mr. Rector! - Klevenow. Good day! - How do you do. You're the headmaster of this school? - Yes. What can I do for you? - I'm looking for Mr. Kurrat. Ku rrat? His secretary called us. He's been absent from his factory for three days. But it... it can't be! Please have a seat, Mr... Klevenow. K-L-E-V-E-N-O-W. But... What a most peculiar coincidence! We're looking for him as well. - And why are you looking for him? - Because... Because his... his son is missing! - Since when? - The day before yesterday. - And the idea of calling the police didn't cross you mind? - But I... - Miss Gabert will confirm that my first thought was... - And the second one? - You must've had more than one thought. - Pardon me? - There you are. I told you we'd get into a mess! - What mess? Do you think it's a pleasure having the police around? I want to know why you didn't inform the police? Because... Because... I can hardly wait for your answer! Your lesson, Miss Gabert! Orpheus defeated the realm of death, he enchanted the people ofthe shade with his chant and he had Eurydike back. We can see this scene in another famous sculpture. Orpheus putting his hand on Eurydike's arm because out of longing for his loved one, Orpheus did not adhere to one of the conditions ofthe realm of death. - Which condition, Lunzmann? - lt's forbidden to turn around! Scumbag! l'm reprimanding you for inappropriate behaviour, Jonigkeit! And now come here and apologise to Hensen! Sorry! Go back to your seat immediately, Jonigkeit! Immediately... Say sorry! I'm sorry. Best regards from Ku rrat. - Who has keys for this house? - Only me and Mr. Kurrat! - Nobody else? - Perhaps Mr. Kurrat's son has one too. But he doesn't live here, he's at his boarding school. - And what's your function here? - l'm Mr. Kurrat's private secretary. - And you went to the cinema with the housekeeper yesterday night? - Yes, I did. And when we came back, it was all like is there. Mr. Kurrat does not do this usually, he is very orderly. And you have no idea what could be missing here? [Speaks ltalian] They are just photographs. - What's that? - They are just photographs. | see. Yes, photographs. - Who are you? - Hello. My name is Hendriks. I'm looking for Mr. Kurrat. Oh, Mr. Kurrat? How interesting. Has there been a burglary here? Are you here to confess or what? No. But if you can do without your police attitude for a moment, we could talk about it properly. Mr. Kurrat's son has disappeared. I... - I'm one of his teachers. - Well now. It's getting more interesting every minute! You can't imagine the situation. l was telling them about Orpheus and Eurydike and when I turned around, who did I see? You and me, in colour! It was really embarrassing! Maybe we ought to be more careful. - Careful? Why? - I don't know. - | feel like we're being spied on all the time! - Don't be silly! - And if it gets out? - But it's out already! And under these circumstances, I feel forced to admit everything to the boys. Admit what? That I'm going to marry you, the super-teacher, of course! Doctor! Muhl really has a rare talent to burst in on the best moments. They want you to come, Doctor! They found a corpse! Salt! We pour salt onto the eels to rid them oftheir slime. - But that's cruelty to animals! - We've always done it like this. Don't you wanna take a seat? The inspector must be here any minute. No, we've always done it like this! - Hello, Mr. Rector! - Hello. - Klevenow. Well, we can take a look right away. I hope none of you will mind. lnspector? The boy we're looking for was 1.8 meters tall and had strong, dark hair! - Why 'had'? - I meant 'has'. This will hardly help us. The head ofthe corpse got caught in a propeller and what's more, one arm is missing. Probably eaten by the fishes. We'll have to determine the identity in another way. Oh well, a body without life is just a piece of shit! - This is definitely not Kurrat! - No. It isn't. It is almost certainly a man aged between 40 and 45. I suppose we're not needed anymore, now that we know it's not Kurrat? No. It can't be Ku rrat. - You don't happen to have an intuition as to who it could be? - No... I'd like to leave now if you don't mind. I'm not feeling very well. Stallmann! - I recognize his scar! - Who is Stallmann? A teacher at our school! Hendriks and I visited him just two days ago. He was downright confused. - Suicide? - Far from it. He has been shot. If you think you can bullshit me the same way as your teachers, you're mistaken. lwon't be taken in by lies. I don't care if you lie the snot out of your noses. But not to me! I know you consider me a member of the limp generation, but anyhow... I want to know the truth. Well, that should do as an introduction. You boys can wait outside. You'll stay here. Let's start. Tell me about these naughty verses. - Oh, that was quite harmless. - You call that harmless? - Yeah. I wanted to pull Kurrat's leg. - And why? - Because he's always such a loudmouth. - And why did you run down Stallmann? - Because... - Because what? Well, | always had a feeling that they... That they what? That they were screwing each other! That's just nonsense. Kurrat isn't gay, just like you and me. And if he was, it'd be neither your nor my business. - You think so? - Yes, I think so. - And what did he think of Genschke? - Nothing at all. He despises people like Genschke. - And vice versa? - Ask him! You don't like Kurrat too much, right? Kurrat... is a show-off! - And into which category would you put yourself? - Me? - No. You! - I don't understand you! Maybe you'll understand better if I claim that you hated Kurrat! - Who says so? - That's not important. You were furious because he never took you along to Lonny. Isn't that so? - lnspector, l... - I knew I was right! - I bet Genschke made that up! - No, my dear Lunzmann, I did. Well... - I'd like to know why you dislike Mr. Fromm so much? - Fromm? VVhy? - Because you spread such nicely aimed rumours! - What rumours? That Fromm eats naughty students for breakfast! - You have funny ideas! - No funnier than yours! Kurrat, the 'corpse'! But you know exactly where Kurrat is! - No! Why are you saying this? - Because I'm saying it! Tell me: Where could Kurrat be? I believe he's dead. As dead as Stallmann? Yes. And you believe he's alive? - Kurry? - Yes, Kurry! - I don't know where he is. - Maybe he's at Lonny's! - In her handbag or her powder tin? - Who let you in and out at night? Mrs. Muhl? - It wasn't Mrs. Muhl! - And why did Mr. Muhl do it? - Kurrat... - Kurrat what? Kurrat bribed him! He paid his debts at the pub and lottery! - And... - And Lonny! - Lonny? Ugh! - Come on, don't be a saint! But you're all wrong, Inspector! I'd never go astray, believe me. I've taught singing to jokers that were even funnier than you, just wait! My respects, Inspector! But surely, you'll appreciate my rendering of an old Roman principle: 'Ego sum, qui sum'. I guess you'd like to hear it in German, Inspector? 'I am who I am', you little dud! But I can change my tune too, believe me! A fine boarding school, really. First of all, it's a genteel boarding school, Mr. Chief Inspector! - They don't just kill people here. - But? Here, they murder deliberately... and prudently. - Oh, isn't that chic? - Come, come! You won't get any closer to the core! Hendriks, Hendriks! You never fail to fascinate me! You always have such audacious theories! A pity they don't convince me! Anyhow, there can be only one single reason for Stallmann's death! The whole thing is keeping you remarkably busy! Do you mind me giving it a thought? Stallmann must have seen something... with his telescope. Fromm! Have a look, Fromm! Quick! What was I supposed to see? Fatima's holy mother? Nonsense! Kurrat! I could swear it was Kurrat! It's all a matter ofthe nerves, Hendriks. Nothing else. My nerves have been quite alright so far. Say, what answer did you give me when I asked you for your alibi? None. - In fact, you didn't ask me! - Oh, did I not? Fromm! Why don't you say what you want to say? It's not that important. I just thought... If we live, we live for the Lord, If we die, we die for the Lord. Thus we are ofthe Lord, both in life and in death. [TO OUR DEAR COLLEAGUE STALLMANN] The Lord has given it, [REST IN PEACE] the Lord has taken it away. Praised be the name ofthe Lord. Since god, the almighty hath decided to call our brother Hans Stallmann from this earthly life, we cradle his body in god's acre. So that he will be earth again, from which he was taken. Earth to Earth, Ashes to Ashes, Dust to Dust. I came back for Stallmann. Why for Stallmann? I heard he killed himself... for my sake. He was shot. And you won't explain to us why you ran away? You don't want to tell us. Or would you prefer... these gentlemen to leave? Inspector! We have the right... I don't know which right you're talking about! That evening, when you left the school... were you with Stallmann then? Yes. In his room? What did you talk about? About the tears of St. Lawrence. The falling stars... on unobscured August nights... - The Perseids. - Yes. And what else? That's what I can't talk about. But it would be better if you did. So your relationship with Stallmann was... very close? - Did he have enemies? - Everyone has enemies! - Don't talk nonsense now! - I'm just tired! Me too. But we've got a murder to solve. Maybe we could adjourn the interrogation until tomorrow, considering the physical condition ofthe student? We've given him a single room on our ward. Well, alright. But who will guarantee that you won't run away again? Me. You've got my word. Oh... Mr. Kurrat? Where is your father? My father? I don't know! You... You're suspected of murder! He'll probably have noticed by now. He's certainly smart enough. Are you mad? - What do you want? - What do we want? We've been waiting for you, you clown! I can't understand you. Are you here to celebrate my return or Stallmann's funeral? Alright, so he's dead. Shot. - You don't need to tell us! - Here are your clothes! I'm glad you're back! - Is there anyone who knows more than he's supposed to? - I don't know. - Genschke shat out the usual lot. - And we told them about the weather! - Where were you anyway? - At home. - All the time? - Hendriks is pestering us all the time! Speaking of pestering: Miss Gabert lost her pills! - And what will you do now? - I'm going to take a shower. - Take a shower? - Anything wrong with that? I'm glad you're taking care of Kurrat. But now it's time for bed, gentlemen! Look, if we're getting on your nerves, you might as well tell us. You don't need to tell us anything either, really! - We don't want to know anything! - You'll have to wait, Sickelcka. Come, friends, let's kiss our pillows! Sickelcka! Tomorrow at noon, there'll be a big bang! What's going on, Muhl? There's no light in the entire building! Somebody's been tampering here. - There we are! - What would we do without you, Muhl? What are you doing here? On my bed! Come, shove off and spread your stink elsewhere! Look at me, Genschke! What did you two cook up? Genschke... Remember the shower... Gas! Gas! Teachers! Teachers! - What happened? - Gas! Fromm! Fromm! Switch the gas mains off, quick! Ku rrat! Higher! Higher! Higher! To the left! So I was right! The tread marks lead to the pond. They lead to the pond. But not back again. Number two! Inspector! Inspector! They want you on the phone immediately! It's urgent! These are the bullets we took out of Stallmann's lungs. They were fired from this gun. And apparently, Kurrat senior was shot with this same gun. - Kurrat's father? - We just fished him out ofthe pond. Do you mean to say that Kurrat...? I'm not saying anything, Mr. Rector. I just concluded that here, we have a weapon which definitely killed one man and probably the other. But that's a horrible suspicion you're hinting at! - What suspicion is that? - That it was Kurrat who... killed Mr. Stallmann. Not bad. Old Kurrat finds out about his son's special relationship with Stallmann, the son gets his inconvenient father out of the way and is thereupon blackmailed by Stallmann. He... Kurrat clears the table by killing his teacher as well. - Inconceivable! - Sort of. You've got a vivid imagination, Mr. Rector. - Unfortunately, also a dirty one. - Inspector, I must ask you emphatically... - Yes? - Never mind. By the way, where's Mr. Hendriks? He'll be back any minute. Anyway, the question is: Who killed young Kurrat? Whoever it was... apparently wanted to simulate an accident. An old, forgotten gas mains and two locking caps, which were removed temporarily. The marks left by these pliers are absolutely clean and quite fresh. They happen to be your pliers, Mr. Muhl! That's what I expected. - Pardon? - I expected you to suspect him. Naturally, they're his pliers! But why should that matter in any way? That's what I'd like to know. Tell him! Tell him what you did and what you know! He already did, Mrs. Muhl. B...but why are you suspecting him then? But aren't you suspecting him too? Excuse me. An urgent call came in for you at the office, Inspector. - I've had it put through to here. - Yes, thank you. Klevenow? Who called? Repeat that, please. No! Wait till I'm there! Purzer! Take the evidence. You must excuse me now, but something came up. Ladies and gentlemen, for the time being, you're not permitted to leave the school. You're suspected of murder. All of you! - I'm leaving! - They'll never let you go. - You of all people! - This isn't a school anymore, it's a morgue! - My father will pick me up in an hour. - Yes... If you're still alive by then. What... what do you want from me? What are you doing in Kurrat's room? Nothing at all, I didn't... What? Didn't you always want Kurrat to go to the devil? Now he has gone where you wanted him to go. What else do you want now? You must be crazy! You... You are crazy! Did you come to see me, Hendriks? Please, come in. Hey there! So? - I have just one question. - Go ahead! Why did you kill Kurrat? He just can't help it! You had suspected me before, Hendriks. And, under the circumstances, I was hardly offended by it. But in this moment, you've lost your marbles, my friend. Like a drink? Something forms, in certain situations, under certain conditions. Why don't you approach that admirable Inspector Klevenow? He's interested in all kinds of speculations. Of course, you'd also have to deliver some evidence. I have a feeling, Fromm. Oh sure, feelings. Feelings are everything! And what is your feeling based on? Why were you more concerned about Kurrat's bath robe than about Kurrat himself? His bath robe? The coroner would be very grateful for this clue. Don't you want to think it over once more, before making such a fool of yourself, Hendriks? I've given it quite enough thought. So did I. But I've drawn completely different conclusions. Isn't it strange that you never told me about them? I meant to give you a chance to correct your own mistakes. A teacher who constantly needs correction isn't exactly an imposing personality. But since you enjoy it so much, I'll gladly recapitulate the case with you. You're forgetting something. What? Your dog. Come, go on out. Master will come soon. We mustn't jump to conclusions. Let me, as the older of us, remind you of the fundamental question: The most vital part of a crime is the motive. This might not be a motive, but it's something. With gratitude to Wilhelm Kurrat, who saved my life. Helmuth Fromm. I found it in the shower room. Let me see it! The man in this photograph doesn't look like you. He looks completely different. Who are you, Fromm? That would be so useless. Come in. Who are you? My name is Fromm. Helmuth Fromm. What do you mean? That you've been living under a false name for nearly 25 years! Your real name is Brandt, Dr. Felix Brandt. Supervisor of section 7. Medical experiments on the living subject. Remember? Do you remember, or has it been too long? 'I herewith confirm the arrival ofthe following objects for the series of experiments assigned to me: Heinz Kruger, Andreas Galinski, Tanja Nathanson, Yuri Wasillowski, Helmuth Fromm...' And so on and so forth. Signed: Dr. Felix Brandt. Does that answer your question? Now I want to hear it from your mouth! From your mouth! I killed Stallmann, I killed Kurrat. The father and the son! Don't you shout at me! Dr. Brandt, I have orders to arrest you. Here's the warrant. Just a second. I'll be ready in a moment. Hats off to you, Hendriks. You should leave courageousness to the police in future. I wasn't feeling so courageous, Inspector. Rather, slightly melodramatic. Besides, it wasn't as dangerous as you think. Since he he'd put his gun into Kurrat's bath robe, he couldn't have shot me. And the dagger... EVERYTHING FOR GERMANY Never mind... May I hand this back to you, Mr. Fromm? Mr. Kurrat saved my life back then. He was a male nurse. He stated that I had died in the camp's isolation ward. They didn't check up on it any further, as a human life wasn't worth much... back then. Furthermore, the war was about to end. Brandt knew everything about Fromm, he had all his papers and documents and he also knew that Fromm only had remote relatives. The particulars of the teacher Fromm served as a perfect basis for a new, clean existence. Until the old Kurrat showed up here and recognised him. Because of a few slaps. But Mr. Fromm, only the one who's been treated unjustly can express a will to forget. Besides, there might be a will to forget. But a duty to forget doesn't exist. - However, if you don't mind, I'd like a short talk with Mr. Fromm in private. - Sure! During this talk, he demanded of Brandt that he turn himself in. He granted him a deadline of seven days. Then he informed his son and me. Today is the seventh day. But how was Stallmann involved? There can be just one explanation. Stallmann had lost his nerves and Fromm, I mean Dr. Brandt, believed that there was another witness. Isn't it rather unusual that he came to you at this late hour? What's so unusual about it? What? Is it unusual for a student... for a student to have confidence in his teacher? He had to assume that Kurrat had confided his knowledge to Stallmann. He knocked me down! - Go, get something, quickly! - What, Mr. Rector? Just anything, something to cover him with. It was an accident. Mr. Fromm fell from his window. Go back to your classes now. It... it was an accident. Subtitled by Draxtra aka AnDeRsSoN aka RudolfLemkeSchmidt - 09/2010
