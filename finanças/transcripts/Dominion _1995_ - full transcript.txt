- [Larry] Lynwood Adventures, Larry Beckett speaking. - [Harris] Larry Beckett. Cliff Harris here, how the hell you doing? - [Larry] Harris! Doing well. Been blessed with this weather, we're booked solid for three months. - [Harris] Oh, that's great, I'm glad to hear it. Look, I hope you're gonna be able to accommodate our annual outing this year. - [Larry] Okay, let's see. How many in your party? - [Harris] Gonna be six of us. - [Larry] Adding one this year, huh? Five day trip? - [Harris] Yep. Hey, what's the chances of getting into sector three? - [Larry] Uh, let's see what I can do. I may have to put you in sector two. Let me see what I can juggle here, I'll let you know. - [Harris] Great. - [Larry] Uh, we're making some changes here; we've relocated the drop-off and pick-up site, but don't worry, I'll work everything out. - [Harris] Perfect. Thank you, Larry, looking forward to seeing ya. - [Larry] Okay, you take care, Harris, and I'll see you when you get there. - [Reporter] Good morning, America. It's seven a.m. And what a great day we're starting out with. Look it, there's no rain expected with the next couple days, we're smooth sailing with nothing but clear skies. Look, the freeways are clear, no report of trouble as of yet, so it looks like it's a non-stress-- - Mommy, which one do I wear? The red or the purple? - Go ask your father. And tell him his coffee's ready, okay? - [Reporter] School reunions. You know, I just had my 20-year reunion. - Daddy! Eat that, please. - Okay, who takes out the trash while Daddy's gone? - I do. - And who walks the dog? - Sharee? - Oh, Daddy, I hate cleaning up poopoo. - Poopoo's part of the program. I don't want any reports of misconduct while I'm gone. That means you, buddy. - But Daddy! - Come here and give me a kiss. Come on, come on. Oh, I'm gonna miss you, rugrat. - So, we fly in in a helicopter and they drop us off here in sector seven. - [Harris] That's right. - Okay, but don't make a mess. - Then we shoot a few deer, catch a few fish and what? We work our way back to where they dropped us off? - Yes, you're a genius. - Emmie, it's time to get to get the old man. - Coffee? - I shoulda brought my compass. - Perelli, go get me some juice. - And right over here and-- - Hey, Cully. - Yeah? - How's those mutual funds you got me hooked up with? - They're gone. Don't worry, we'll do it again. - [Harris] Come on, let's go guys. Joey, you got the gun? - Of course, let's go! - You be careful. - You worry too much. - Have a good time. - All right, I love you. - I love you, too. - I'm coming, I'm coming. - [Joel] Honey, I forgot my brain. - Shut up. Joel, you're gonna love this trip. Trust me, this place is like a paradise. Isn't that right, Fitzy? - [Fitz] That's right. Hey, Perelli, crank up the music. Let's hit some stuff. Hit that right back in the open. - [Perelli] Yeah, just keep clapping. - Hey, there. - Yo, Fitzy. - Larry, great. - Look, I'm sorry about your trip. Our insurance company won't cover all of your equipment. - Larry, I don't wanna hear any of that. - Now, please, I'm sorry guys. We'll make it up to ya next year. Promise. - Another satisfied customer. Larry Beckett! - Harris. - You son of a bitch. - Damn, long time. - Joel, come here. Joel Kelly, this is Larry Beckett. - How ya doing? - He's a rookie this year and he's my partner back in the real world. - It's a pleasure to meet you, Sir. - The pleasure's mine, Joel. So what is it this year? Moose? - Nah, no predictions. - You know, last year he predicted an eight pointer. Brought one back just like he said. - Any sign of Lynwood? - Oh. Going on six months now. After the accident, uh, things got different. I guess he just needed a change of scenery. Ah, let me see. Well, your papers are finalized. You'll be in sector three as requested. - Great, same pick up site as last year? - Ah, no, it's been relocated to sector seven. It's more centrally located. Kinda makes it easier on the other parties. Two pick-ups each day. Noon and four. So, just get on board the whirlybird and get the hell outta dodge. - All right, we're ready, we'll see you when we get back. - Great, have a good trip. - Nice meeting you, sir. - [Larry] Good to meet you, too. - If Lance pukes I'm in your help, Perelli-- - All right, listen up. We should be in sector seven in about 45 minutes. After the drop you can hike into sector three. Rendezvous points are as indicated. Each hunting party is designated by color. Your color is blue. It is important, however, that you wear your tags and keep within the designated areas. Don't worry, you won't come in contact with anyone but your own group. Harris, gift from Beckett, he says you know what it means. - What is it? - It's a compass. Beckett says I can't find my own ass with my own two hands. Smartass. - [Pilot] All right, guys, landing site in 30 seconds. - All right! - [Pilot] Homer, this is Hawk landing in sector seven for drop off. Happy hunting, gentlemen. We'll see ya on Monday. Go! - Hey, Andy, Perelli. - Yeah? - Yeah? - You gotta use this for a piece in the nightly news. - Don't think we can do that, buddy. He bullshitted the entire news room, told them he was going on his second honeymoon and he's got his wife believing he's on assignment. - No jokes, brother. - Yeah. - What? - Oh my god, you got wet. - Little shit. - Who made him head boy and uh? - Flipped a coin. - Okay, well, I wasn't aware of that. - That's 'cause you got your head up your ass. Then again, you like the view. - Okay, would somebody else like to add something? All righty. - Are we here? - Yeah, this is it. - Well, it's about time. - So, how did this motley crew get together for this annual trip? I mean, there's gotta be a story. - Don't ask. - No. - No one would believe it. - I wanna know this. - So you wanna hear this story? - Would you just tell the story for Christ's sake. - Okay. About seven years ago there's a shooting at Finkelstein jewelry shop nextdoor to my pub. Your sniveling partner there is the officer arresting. Perelli is there with the TV pukes for the news story, you know. At the time I'm expanding for a new kitchen. Now, Lance, is delivering sheet supply wood from the lumber yard. I didn't know any of these dipshits at this point, only Lance. Cully was meeting Lance at my joint for lunch after delivery. So Harris brings in old man Finkelstein just to calm the old man down, you see? Now, Finkelstein IDs Cully as the guy who hits the store. Then the old man has a heart attack and dies in my pub. My pub. Harris takes Cully in as a suspect. Cully has no idea what's going on, he's been in my place drinking all day long before the hit occurs, right? You with me so far? Now, here's what we do: Lance and I, we go down to the station. Perelli's already there with the TV pukes. Harris is a prick as usual. Lance and I spend all night trying to make bail for Cully. 4:30 in the morning they nab the guy. He's a four-foot-six towel head. (laughing) It seems that this guy had bought a ring for his old lady and wanted to return it. Old man Finkelstein wouldn't accept it. So, the guy pulls out a 22 and starts shooting the place all to hell. - Unbelievable. - Yeah. - No, it's true. Every word of it. - And that's our story and we're sticking to it. - Hell, that's about all the memory lane I can handle, guys. We got an early morning. - Yeah, you better get some sleep, Lance. Tomorrow we gotta climb Mount Big Balls. - You hear about the Polish market yet? - No, I haven't. - Here we go. - Ooh, it's some water, man. - Yeah! - Quit talking like that, Perelli. - Hey, everybody, line up right here. I wanna get a picture of the wild bunch. - Oh, Perelli. - Come on. - [Joel] Where we at here? - [Perelli] Okay, guys, line up. It's good. - Come on in here, come on! John! John! Come on! John! Help me! Hurry! - [Harris] Whoa there, Daniel Boone. - [Eric] Come on! - Hey, I'm surprised Lance hasn't taken a dump yet. How ya doin' there, Okie Bob? - You really do love to flap that jaw, don't ya? - Hey, you know, when Lance takes a dump he looks at is and he says to himself did I eat that? - Fresh tracks. - John! - Let me have some of that. - Does Lynwood own all of this property or what? - Lynwood and Beckett are smart. They divided this up into sectors, stocked it with game and guarantee you won't see anybody but your own hunting party. - Well, they've done pretty well for themselves courtesy of guys like us. - Lynwood's becoming reckless. Been that way since the accident. - Accident? What happened? - Well, his boy got killed. Boy about your age. Seems he wandered off from the party. It was his first time out in his father's playground. This kid, he didn't have much experience hunting. Then some other hunters spooked the deer his way without knowing the kid was in the area. He was all by himself when it happened. Just an accident. Simple accident. - You ready? - Yeah. - Let's go. - Lance. Come on, we got a long way to go, Tapioca. - Yeah, there's nothing to that. There you go, Perelli. Be my guest. - [Perelli] Cully? - Yeah? - You really expect me to do this? - No, Joel, I think you can jump. - That was funny. - You know how you can tell that's an Irish fish? - No, how? - Fat on the top, skinny on the bottom. - Yeah, and full of shit just like you. - Fuck you. - You know, I love this. It's so peaceful out here. When are we gonna kill something? - Yeah, Harris. When are we gonna see something we can shoot at, huh? - Guys. You know something, I think I could honestly say I don't care if I fire shots this whole trip. I mean, this is what it's about right here. This is what it's about. The whole friendship thing, you know. I know Fitz doesn't care. I mean, I remember a couple years ago you forgot to bring your bullets and nobody'd give ya any 'cause you were being such a prick to everyone. You never fired your rifle at a thing. And you had the best trip you've ever had. Am I right or am I right? - Nah, he ain't bullshitting. - I don't know. I'd be disappointed if I didn't see something. - Well, I'd like to see something. I'd like to see you, Cully, in a sarong and a pair of those flip flop surfer shoes and wearing one of those little mini afros you can strap around your slagging jaw. No, I'm kidding, it's ah. - Yeah, well, my wife would not much care for it if all I came home with was poison ivy on my ass. - Forget your wife. What about you? - Really, forget about your wife. - Oh. - You guys don't get it. Do ya? I mean, it's not about killing something, it's the hunt, it's being out here, it's the adventure. I mean, we go to work and we come home and we do the traffic and all that crap. - You're not gonna sing, are you? - I might sing, I'm thinking about singing. - Yeah, well that's beautiful. - Who invited him? Really, I'm worried about ya, I'm very very worried about ya. I just realized something, you know. I spent 2500 bucks to sit out here with a bunch of assholes. That's what I just realized. Well, I'm going to bed. - Sweet dreams, love. - [Harris] Good night, Johnny boy. - I'll never forget that Filipino kid in that wet suit. - You okay? - Yeah. Just thought I heard something, that's all. - Yeah, nights are funny that way sometimes. Little spooky. - [Joel] Oh man. I have to cross this? - No taxis up here, kid. - [Harris] Come on, it's a cake walk. - [Fitz] Yeah, let the men go first. - Excuse me. - Get up there. Hey, you coming? - [Joel] Don't wait for me. - [Harris] Don't look down there, Fitzy. Man, that's one hell of a drop. - What are you doing now? Oh, thank you, Perelli. That's very reassuring. - Move, move! Get to cover, move! Go. - What the fuck was that? - Did you see where the shots are coming from? - [Cully] No. - Oh my god! Oh my god. - Fitz, give me your pistol. - We can't just leave him there, come on! - What are you doing? - Joel's gotta have cover. - Tuck up both feet. - Did you spot him? - Oh god, oh god, oh god. - No, he's up on top of the hill somewhere, I can't see him, - We gotta go back for him! - We can't go back for him, there's no cover. Joel! What's the situation? How bad's he hurt? - He's dead! - Oh my god, oh my god. - Shut up, shut up! Joel, go back to camp, we'll meet you there. - Right! - Fitz. - Yeah? - You take the flank, I'm gonna take the lead. All right, let's move. Let's move! Come on. - Fuck. - [Harris] Clear, come on! - You think the kid's okay? - God, I hope so. Come on, let's move. - [Cully] What the hell is that? - Oh god. - He's dead, isn't he? - Oh, this is no good, guys. We gotta get the hell outta here. - Lance! - Man, this guy was from sector four. - Yeah, so what? - He wasn't alone. Means the rest of his group are out there somewhere. Running scared just like us. - It's your call, Harris. - We can't just leave him here like this. - We're not gonna leave him like this, Lance. - Now, look, we're one of the top financial management teams in Chicago. Over a hundred billion dollars in assets and I got 18% of the core group threatening to pull the plug on me. Now, in the middle of all this, the wife calls. Little Jimmy's got the chicken pox and my mother-in-law's moving in with us. - Oh. - Oh. You think you got the blues? - Joel! Joel. Oh my god. All right. You spread out and if you see anything you wave to me. - All right. Joel? Joel! - Oh god. - Come on. - Oh god, no. No, no! No, god! God. - Who are you? Why did you kill Perelli? - Silence is golden. - What? - God, who coulda done this? There's a mad man out there. God damn insane. - Harris, we can't stay here, we gotta contact someone. - Who? Who we gonna call? We're 40 miles from the nearest fucking town. One of us is dead and one of us missing. If it was you out there instead of Joel you can bet we'd be looking for your ass. - Look, I don't wanna leave Joel behind any more than you do, all right? I just don't think we're equipped to handle this ourselves-- - Cut the bullshit. - Fitz, enough! - We're still in, now wait a minute. - Fitz, come on man! Let's stay together. Listen to yourself. Now, there's something what Lance is saying here. Now, we gotta give word back to someone, right? - Joel was trying to send a signal. The way I see it, Joel set Perelli over there and then he must've moved 'cause I think he got hit coming out of Fitz's tent and was carried off in this direction. - Mm hmm, and we're probably next on his list. So, what we need to do is get the fuck outta here. - Hey, we're not leaving Joel. - Oh, you know he killed Joel just like he killed Andy and the others. - Stop saying that, Joel's not dead. - And just like he's gonna kill us. - I said shut up! - Fuck you. - That's enough! - Fuck you! - Hey, now, get over here. Stop it! God damn it! Now, we're not the enemy. The enemy's out there. If we wanna survive we got to stay together. Now, Joel ain't here. Let's assume that he's alive. - [Lance] Joel is alive. - You bet your ass he's alive. - God damn. - You're Lynwood, aren't you? - Very good. Welcome home, boy. - You bastard. - You stepped into my backyard unwelcome. Now you'll stay for dinner. (birds chirping) - Eric! John! Oh my god. Al, Al! Oh my god, I know this guy. - He's alive. (groaning) It's okay, shh. - Who did this? - Oh god. - Who did this to you, Max? - One man. - Who Max? Who? - One man. - Max? Oh. Oh my god. - Can't we do this without having to split up? - No, we can't. Fitz and I talked it over. Cully and I are gonna go for help and we can't drag Perelli's body around so you're gonna have to stay here in case Joel shows up, all right? You stay with Fitz, you'll be safe with him. You ready? - All right. - Fitz! Dig in and stay put. All right, let's go. - Lance, come on. - Harris. We'll find Joel. - You all right? All right, let's move. - You okay? - Yeah, I'm just really scared. - Yeah, me too. That'll keep us alive though, huh? - Can we get through up there? Huh? Harris? Can we get through? - I don't know. - Look, Harris. I know you're a cop and you deal with killing every day, but I don't. Hell, the only killing I've ever seen is on TV or at the movies. - It's not the killing. It's not the killing, it's the fear. When your life or someone else's life is in danger it doesn't matter what you're up against. You become an animal and you do whatever it takes to survive any way, any how. And there's one man out there. Tracks at the camp tell us that. And that son of a bitch bleeds just like you and me. Now, you're afraid? Use that fear to survive. - [Cully] Can we take five? - Let's rest here a minute. Cully! - Oh God! My leg! Harris! Harris! - [Harris] I'm coming, buddy I'm coming! - Help me! - Hang tight, I'm coming to ya. - [Cully] Harris! Help! - I got ya. I got ya. - [Cully] My god it hurts. - All right, grab onto my leg. - My leg. - Grab my leg, now hang on. All right, here we go. Grab this rope, hang on. - Can't move. - Okay, I'm not gonna let you fall. All right, I'm gonna have to cut ya loose, now hang on. - Okay. - [Harris] Traps set all over this place. - Gotta put me down, Harris. You gotta put me down now, it's my leg. - Oh, easy. There we go. I'm gonna have to set your leg, buddy. Okay? - Okay, okay. Just set it, Harris, I'm okay. - Okay, let's see. - [Harris] Okay, this might hurt a little. Here we go. - I'm with this girl, right? And I give her the classic line: let's go to your place. She goes for it. So, we're driving up in the hills, it's really raining. - So, this is the first time you met her? - [Fitz] Yeah. - No wonder my wife thinks you're such a womanizer. - Shut the fuck up. You wanna hear this or not? - I'm sorry, go on. - Why do you do that? - Come on, I said I was sorry. - Okay. So we're driving in this piece of shit Fiat about 35 miles an hour. Car spins out, slams into this embankment. - Were you hurt? - No, I wasn't hurt. We climb outta the car, we're shitfaced, really shitfaced. So she says that's my house over there. So, we go into the house. - She lives alone? - Yeah. - You old dog. - So I started giving her the old bamboozle. - Which means what? - I'm fucking her. - Oh, okay, all right, I'm starting to follow you now. - Anyway. So, she started to moan, right? I mean really moan. I'm going hey, you like that, baby? The dizzy bitch goes no, my arm is broke. - That's terrible. - Her fucking arm is broken. - What was that? - What? - Now what was that? - Lance. Take it easy. - Oh god. - It's just the night playing with your head. Hey, look. You get some shut eye, I'll take the first watch. - Oh God. - Hey, over here! John and Eric left early in the morning to scout our sector. When they didn't come back, Al and I went to look for 'em. On our way back to camp we found Max and his party. They were dead, all of 'em. Butchered. - Who would do that? - One man. Those were Max's dying words. - What do you suggest we do? - Eric and John are still out there. What I suggest we do is pair off in groups of two, comb this mountain and find this guy before he kills again. - All right, all right. You two go north, you two go south. You guys go east, we'll go west. You guys see anything at all, fire one shot, one shot. - Okay, stay sharp. Try not to shoot each other. (dramatic music) Well, go! Go! - [Harris] Hey. How you feeling? - Cold. - Okay. Here's a water. I'm gonna leave my gun with ya. Safety's on. All right, I'm gonna go try and find somebody. Hey, I'm gonna try and get us some help. You just stay put, okay? Okay, buddy. - Harris! You kill that son of a bitch. - Fitz? Fitz? Fitz? Fitz? Son of a bitch. Fitz. Fitz. Fitz! - Come on through. Up here. Right there, motherfucker! Right there, don't move, not another inch! - Now, wait a minute guys. I'm looking for help. - Drop that gun. Drop it! - Take it easy, guys. - Drop it! Drop it! - All right, all right, all right. I'm putting it down, okay? See? Just take it easy, take it easy. - What's that in your pocket? Don't even breathe, don't even think about it. That's John's map. You son of a bitch! - [Al] You fucking killed John. - I didn't kill anybody, it's-- - Shut the fuck up! You know, this mountain is crawling with guys looking for you. And you know what? The justice system, it just doesn't work anymore. So I think me and Al are gonna save the tax payers a little bit of money. What do you say, Al? Huh? - Yeah. - I find you guilty, you son of a bitch. Al! - You're gonna need this. - What happened? - Al. Al! - Easy. What happened? - He killed Al. - Who? - Tall, dark hair. He killed Eric and John. - Listen, I'm sorry about your friends, Roy, but we gotta get to the landing site, all right? There's a pick up in an hour and we gotta inform Beckett. Can you walk? - I can walk, god damn it. - [Cully] Jesus Christ, Harris! - We gotta go. I'm in a load of trouble. Easy, we gotta make it back to camp. - What about the pack? - Forget the pack, we gotta go. - [Cully] What's going on? - Hunters from the other sectors think I'm the one killing people and now they're after me. Fitz? Fitz! Okay, real easy. - [Cully] Right here, all right. - All right. Okay. All right, all right. Fitz? Lance? I'll be right back. - No! - You bastard. Fuck you. - What do you see here? You see a world within another world. Apart from all that exists. Sometime ago I, too, was drawn to the way of the hunt. Its insipid addiction left me cold. To be alone like a tear. An unforgiven tear as it is dried with some cheap paper tissue. I can make the Earth stop in its tracks. I alone have that power. There's still a few animals left in the yard. - You're mad. - There is no mystery to my dream. All that exists rest patiently on my arrival. I am the father. I have nothing left in the world. I have seen two sides of life. I live them both. You have only seen one. And will expire before the next begins. Lick your wounds, young one. I've only begun to hunt. - You know, every time we'd get together everybody'd had a different opinion about something. We'd all be fighting and yelling and carrying on. Then, well, Lance would step in. Hey, fellas. You remember one thing. No matter what happens we'll always be friends. - You know Emmie had a party planned for old Fitz. Of course he didn't want anybody to know how old he was so he'd always come up with some excuse to get out of it. Not show up. Well, buddy, I guess you're not gonna make it to this one either, are ya? God, look what he did to you. I'm gonna find him and when I do I'm gonna make him pay. Going to the landing site. There's a pick up scheduled in an hour. If I leave now I think I can make it. - Be careful. - [Pilot] Homer, this is Hawk. We have landed at rendezvous site, no sign of party, over. - Uh, why don't you get out and stretch? - [Pilot] Oh yeah, dying for a smoke. - Homer, this is the Hawk, come in. Homer, do you read me? This is the Hawk. Homer, come in, this is the Hawk. Yeah, we're here. Still no signs of anyone. Give it 15 more minutes unless we can find someone. We'll let you know and come back in. - Oh shit. - Down there! I see him. Shit! God damn it! - Ow. Oh fuck. - Joel! Joel! - Hawk, this is Homer, do you read me, over. Hawk, this Homer, what is your location? Give me a reading, over. Hawk, this is Homer. Come in please, over. Move this thing! - What's he shooting at? - Hey! Over here! Right here! - Lynwood. Why? - You dare ask why. - This is insane. There's a mad man out there. - Here, take some water, will ya? - Will ya? - I don't want any water. God damn it, do you hear what I'm trying to tell you? Are you listening to me? - Yeah, we hear you, now just take it easy. Tell us again what happened. - Three of my friends are dead. Another one's missing and another one's out there looking for help. - Who? - Cliff Harris. - Harris? - Yes. - Oh my god. They're after the wrong man. - Now we got him! - Hold your fire! Hold your fire! Hold it, hold it! You've got the wrong guy. He's one of us. - You knew. You knew. - [Larry] Where is he? - I love you. Come on, we have guests. Thank you. - [Harris] I've been thinking and I've come to the decision I'm giving it up. - What? - I'm gonna quit. - Why? - Something happened to me out there. Something inside, something I can't answer. I thought I could go back to work and things would be normal, but I just can't do it anymore. Since the trip I've been having these nightmares and it's affecting my family. My kids sense something, they see a change in me. And when I look in their eyes I see fear. And I realize that our only choice is to get out, to move. - I don't walk in your shoes, cliff. But you're making a mistake. Running away won't help. - Staying won't either. - Look, partner, you're gonna do whatever you're gonna do. You're a good cop. Goodnight, Cliff. - Goodnight, guys. - Bye, Emmie. - [Joel] Night, Emmie.
