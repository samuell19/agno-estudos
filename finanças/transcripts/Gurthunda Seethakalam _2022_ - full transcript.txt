GURTHUNDA SEETAKAALAM "They say it's an out, if the ball is caught." "It's a six, if the ball goes out of the park." "And it's called love if I'm after you."

Please serve some water. -Here you go. -[chuckles] -Thank you. -Are you South Indian? Yes, I am from Narsapuram, sir. Do people eat pani puri at this time too? -People who are fond of it will eat, sir. -Hey! Hey! Do you call that taste? Sir, do you know one thing? Queen of Mysore eats pani puri without even brushing her teeth. Oho! So you are fooling the people and selling it? Why do you say that? Where is the rest room? Madam... You won't find any rooms to take rest. -You can sleep under the tree if you want. -Hey, Narsapuram! -She is asking about toilets! -Oh, you mean toilet? -Go straight and take a right, madam. -Thanks, brother. -I will come back and pay you. -Okay. Did you see, she called me 'brother'. By the way, does Queen of Mysore eat pani puri for real? No, sir... People are fools. We run our business saying such things. Give me one. Brother, where is the rest room? It's there. Have fun. [metal door creaks closes] Hmm... -Did you see that I have a gun, right? -[in unison] Yes, brother. -If you have a phone you should make... -Brother... -Tik-Tok or play Pub-G, -Sir, please don't hit us. -or make Dubsmash videos. -We won't do it, brother. Why are you recording girls when they are in the bathroom? -Because there is no one to punish you. -Oh, God! -Will you repeat this ever again? -No, sir. -Sorry, sir. -Sorry, sister. -Come on, escape! Let's go. -Come on, let's run. -Thank you. -You are welcome. I thought you'd fight like Bruce Lee. I don't think so. By the way, what did you ask them? I asked them the way to the wash room. That's it? As they were smoking weed so, I said, have fun. Hmm... Do you know, what would have happened if I had not come? Hey, what are you doing? Um, that is... Heroine hugs the hero when he saves her in the films. No need, give me a shake hand. Your smile is good. You are getting a dimple too. In my school Bhargav used to get dimples... ... and I used to put a rupee coin in it. Actually, my name is Divya. I live with my parents and a younger brother in Bangalore. I am pursuing engineering final year, mechanical branch. -Are you mechanical? -Yes. One more year to finish it. Do you know one thing? I like travelling so much. That too, I like it very much in winter. I want to get married after going on a world tour and knowing about life. That too a love marriage. I like love, lovers and love marriages so much. -By the way, where are you going? -Mangalore. Mangalore? Wow, even I am going to Mangalore. May God bless me and devil kiss you. Please can you drop me? -Actually I... -You didn't hug me, at least drop me, please. -You are going to drop me, that's it. -No-- -I will go get my bag, just two minutes. -You don't know who I am-- -Just two minutes, please... -No, seriously? Make it fast, brother. -Where did you go, girl? -Where did you go, Venu brother? I was searching for you all over. I am a girl, you should take care of me, right? It's getting late, I am going. It will get ready in an hour. [tuts] Take couple of hours no problem. -I am going with a friend. -Friend? What's his name? I will ask and text you on WhatsApp. Hey, I will complain to your, dad. I already did that, he asked you to come back with the car. Give me the suit case. How much time would it take to reach Mangalore? It might take 7 to 8 hours. Looks like your time is running good. Why? My friends say that time passes easily with me. Don't know with what intention they have said that. [tuts] It seems I talk very funny. Is it? Come, let's talk on our way. One small request... That is, I am a foodie. Please stop if you find anything to eat while going. But you should pay the bill. -Okay. -Okay. Let's go. By the way, what is your name? -Dev. -[whispers] Dev... Devil, yes. What job do you do? I am a mafia don, I live in Dubai. No. You are just a software engineer. Wow! How? I just know it. I know face reading. -I should be careful with you. -Isn't it? Even my friends say the same thing. Don't know with what intention they said it. [tuts] I am very strict! -I never fell for anyone's intentions. -Oh no! -What's the problem? -Nothing like that. [scoffs] 'Come to the point without talking unnecessary things.' By the way, do you have a GF? -Huh? -GF means girlfriend, -do you have one? -Oh! No, right, I know that you are so decent. Shouldn't I have girlfriends if I am decent? -Do you have? -You know face reading, right? -Try it. -I know... But I doubt. Do you really have one? -I mean in my school days... -Why you are in a hurry? -Huh? -I mean, did you start when you were in school? That was the call of adolescence. Call of adolescence? Ah... That's a kind of sound. -Later? -You want me to tell you the whole story? [tuts] I don't like... If someone doesn't say the whole story. Oh, so that's the problem? Hmm. Fine... I'll say only if you promise me that you will not sleep until I finish. I promise I won't. Once upon a time, there was a boy called... Dev. Action! Hey, Subba Lakshmi is my sister. If I see you with her again... What will you do if your sister roam with me? Pydithalli! It's John Pydithalli! [scoffs] What if you are Pydithalli? I am Dev... Satya Dev. -What will you do? Huh? -Hey! Move! Hey, glasses! Stop shooting. Hey, skinny fellow, go! Everyone leave! -Hey, come with me. -Hey! -Why are you in a hurry? -Come, I will explain. Huh? Hey, man! What is it, dude? Hey, look! He is coming with my Geetha. -[laughs] -So? Hey, I am in love with Geetha, dude. Malik, I don't understand this problem. -Please help me with it. -Malik, you carry on, I will be there. OK, bye. I was trying to sole this problem since yesterday... -But I couldn't... -[indistinct voice] -Ah! -Hey, who are you paying the fees? To him or to the teacher, huh? Come on, go... Get lost! What are you staring? Showing attitude that you are talking to a girl? -Which girl? -My girl Geetha. Did you ever talk to Geetha? You think he fell in love without talking to her? -Hey, tell him. -Mm-huh! Mind your business guys! He can't even say hi to Geetha... It seems he wants to say 'I love you'. If you again hit me, I will complain to my dad. Is it? Go tell him. -Hey, it's an insult to us... -Hmm... Got it? Now, go and propose to Geetha. Oh my God! I am afraid, dude. She only speaks in English. Hey, you are the Power Star in our tuition. -Hi, Geetha! -Oh no! He is here. Bye, Geetha. Hey, Mallik... Tell me some-- Why did Mallik run away as soon as you came here? Is there any problem between you guys? Um... I say that... That topper and you don't make a good pair. -Huh? -You see my friend? There... He is Super Star Mahesh Babu... -He loves you. -What? Love? Yeah! Yeah! [tuts] You see... Um... His English isn't good. I came here to tell you about him. Because our English is good, right? Listen to me carefully, I am already committed. And don't be a mediator. This is the last warning I am giving to you. Hello! If you come with this sort of things... You have to face the consequences. -Understand? -Yeah! Yeah! I am already committed don't be a mediator. -Okay, bye. -What? Hi, Komali! Um... What do you want? Ah... Do you know English? [scoffs] Obviously, I know. I am a topper, I've scored 98% in English. And I scored 2%. Together it will be 100%. -OK, I'll ask you one thing will you say? -Yes. 'I am already committed, don't be a mediator', what does this mean? Oh, that is... That means, I already have a boyfriend, don't interfere, get lost. Hey... Is this in it, or are you adding it up? There is more than that, should I say? No need. I will give my 2 marks to you, go. Please leave. -[tuts] -[tuts] I told you earlier itself. Still, how can your Geetha understand my English? Hey, did Geetha scold me, or you? Let's go. Hey, because of your Geetha that glass-- [music] [music mutes voice] -Did everyone understand? -[in unison] Yes, ma'am! Good. What a beauty, dude. -What is it, dude? -Soundarya, dude. -Where? -There she is. [music mutes voices] What? The girl with spectacles? Dude, you must see her when she removes her spectacles. The way the crown is kept on God's head... In the same way why did they keep it in her mouth? That is called God's blessing. God, wants to unite us. Oh! My dad told me that he'd take me out for shopping today evening. Dude, don't forget to call me in the evening. Okay? My phone number is, 25005555. Bye! Oh no! [chuckles] [phone rings] Hello? Hello? Mom, mom... Always with the phone? Go study for sometime. Hello? Yea! Yes! Hey! What happened to you? Hubby, why are you smelling those flowers like that? We need to smell them like that only Komali. -After that? -Then... We need to have those fruits and sweets. Oho! I know what to do after that. We'd get sleep, after eating all these things... -and sleep! -[laughing] -Yea! -Hey, why are you laughing like this? It's Balu, man! A, B, C, D, E, F, G-- -Hey! -Huh? Hey! Dude, I have managed everything, come with me. -What did you manage and where to? -You come with me! Hey, wait! [cuckoo cooing] -Hi! -Hi... Can you remove those glasses? Satya, your friend told me that, you'd commit suicide if I don't accept your love? Suicide? Who? Why? No, no, no... Actually I had a very bad past. Till today... I have not told this to anyone. I lost my father at the age of 5 years. My mother is only bringing me up. So, I am not in that position. And she don't like love marriages. So, I don't want to hurt her. And I don't love anyone. Hope you understood. Satya, did you understand? Thank you for understanding me. -What did she say? -[laughing] -[laughing continues] -Hello! -Sorry. -Excuse me. That is why I don't share my emotions with anyone. -They are very sensitive. -Oh, sorry. Hey, stop the car! [tires screeching] So, you left that girl because you don't know English. -Isn't it? -Who told you? My grandfather participated in freedom fight in those days, so the Britishers locked him in jail. From then our family members banned English. -So because of that English-- -Stop your nonsense. -Accept that you are from Telugu medium. -Hello! Even I am from English medium, but only girls used to talk in English as if it is a rule. But we boys, talk in Telugu, fight in Telugu, curse each other in Telugu... And we used to flirt with girls only in Telugu. We love our mother tongue Telugu. -We are Telugu warriors, soldiers and-- -Okay, okay... Sorry, sorry, enough. I said it by mistake. -It's okay. -So that's how your love story ended? -During my engineering... -You would have tried during then. But you might have been busy with exams and project works. So it didn't work out? Basically, you need to have some time, right? It's not about free time. We should create some free time. Hey, tell me frankly, you have no one right? -Do you have? -Umm... This fort is good like a black Taj Mahal. Hello, I will make Dev Mahal for you same as Taj Mahal. Tell me, what happened in engineering, please? -Do you know Sachin? -I know, why? Come, I will say. Come, brother. I know that Prashant is here. Dev! Dev! Satya Dev! [group hails] -Dev! Dev! Satya Dev! -[group hails] Dev! Dev! Satya Dev! [group hails] -Dev! Dev! Satya Dev! -Brother... -Is the match so tight? -Yes, brother... Our Dev is bating. And he needs 6 runs for one ball. One ball six runs? Guys, it seems one ball six runs? Dev! Dev! Satya Dev! [group hails] -Brother, come let's catch him. -Hey, wait. The match is interesting. [crowd hailing] [crowd hailing] [crowd continues to hail] Brother, brother! -What happened, brother? -What you are watching up there? Look down. [crowd cheering] -Hey! He got out. -I have put a bet that he will get out. -That's the twist. -Oh! -You lost the match. -Hey! I tried to hit an helicopter shot like Dhoni. Ah? If Dhoni got to know, he'd come home and bash you up. -Damn! -Rajesh that is. Everyone is watching me, let's act as if I am sad. [sighs] Damn it! -Just miss! -Hey, Dev! Hey, there is Komali. What is this? Why are you sitting like Kala Bhairav who killed many people? Hey, idiot! I won't get to bat next time if I don't feel bad. You act as if you are consoling me. [sighs] Hey, Mallik is coming with Swathi's brother to bash me up. Huh? What's that? Didn't you tell them that you have Geetha? Because I said that she got hurt and sent her brother to bash me up. -Ah? -[crowd cheering] -Hmm... -Come, take the wickets and come. Hey, he is taking our wickets. Hey! Keep a stone and play. Dev, send him to me. I will chop him into pieces. Will you eat after doing it? Ignore that. First, he flirted with Geetha. Now he is flirting his sister Swathi too. Are they walls to scratch? [indistinct voices] He and Geetha are lovers since childhood. Why are you interfering? Not all that. I need my Geetha. -Then call her. -She won't come if I call. She will come if he calls. I brought these guys because she shouldn't come if he calls. Oh! He gave his revenge to them. What are you watching, run? -You... -Hey, no, dude! -[groans in pain] -Dude! Hey, it's our bat. It broke for one shot, do you call this a bat? Damn! -Hey! My bat! -You go. -I will not go, brother. -Hey, you go now! -[grunts] -[groans in pain] -You go. -I will finish you. Ouch! Brother, no! My buttocks will swell. -You all are good for nothing. -Get lost! If you dare to touch Prashant-- Hey, you broke our bat and wickets then how should we play? -Hey, even I donated money. -How much did you donate? -Rupees 20/- -Crap! It was me who donated. You are in frustration because you lost the match, send me as an opening batsman, I will win the match. [in unison] We beg you, man! It won't be good for you if you step on the ground. -Hey, come on... Hey, Seetharam. -Get lost! -Give me your mobile immediately, please. -Hey, stop! Give me your mobile... -Who are you calling? -I need to call Geetha. -Hey, text her, I just have a rupee. -Hey, wait... What happened? Ah, I am coming. -Rascal! You could have messaged her. -Hey, wait. -You wasted my penny. -Fine, give me money. -Give me money, Geetha is in danger. -Hey, don't... Give me, money. You can get the recharge done in the coming month. That day Geetha said she is committed. How did Geetha and Prashant become one now? Hmm... You are following it interestingly. Commitment my foot! That's a big lie. That day Prashant took me to Komali, right? Our love stopped that day... ... and their love shined. [honks] -Hey! Stop it! -Stop it, dude! Dad is at home. -He said you are on death bed. -Yes, I am having cold and sneezes. -Oh no! -You did it for this? -Give me my items. -Idiot, don't behave like a beggar. Geetha why did you come out without wearing a sweater? -Here, take this first. -No... -[groans] -Are you feeling shy? Okay, take this fruit and cut and eat and sleep and take rest baby, please. -Okay. -Be nice, okay. You learned so much English? I don't know what you achieved by loving her but you learned English very well. You also love someone, even you will learn English. Hello, they need not teach me English... I will teach them Telugu instead. -We are Telugu warriors. -Hey! How will you teach Telugu to Telugu people, idiot! -Alright, had your BF? -Yeah! -Hey! -Did you tell her that we saw BF? BF means breakfast, man... It's not what we watch, you idiot! Hell with his English! Damn! Ignore him! Geetha, that is... I have a secret medicine. -If I give it to you for once... -Huh! -Wait, listen to me. -Huh! Have your medicine on time. -I will miss you. Geetha... -Hey! Hey! -Baby... Once... -She is suffering with just cold, man! If her father sees you, he will unleash the dogs on you. -Dogs? I am coming. -Bye, Geethanjali, sleep! -Bye! -Get lost! [vehicle starts] [honks] Hey, why are you honking? -I will hit a helicopter shot today... -Ah! Ah! No entry for Dev and Prashant? Rascal! -I curse you! Hope your legs will break. -Your will have no peace! You will understand when you will see cow dung all over the ground. It's finished! Prashant, I just had this one thing to pass my time. This is also gone. -As if you are a great player. -Not all this. Search for a girl, I will get married to her immediately. Hey, what is this? Do you think this is an Irani tea? To get it as soon as you order. Hey, when you see a girl you want, the nature tells you. -Huh? -Yeah! The land starts to tremble, the sky would turn red, all the birds will start singing, you will get unknown changes in your body, -you'll feel it bro. -What else will happen? Yes... Finally it will rain. Wow! Sir! -Greetings. -Don't do it here. -Thank you, sir. I will pass, right? -[chuckles] Obviously you will pass. God damn it! -[indistinct voices] -Hey, run! -[indistinct voice] -Hey, stop! [college bell rings] There is a girls gang here. Like Prashant said, let's see whether the nature gives the signs or not. [humming] [humming] -Yeah! -[indistinct chatter] -Prashant! Dude! -Ah! -Hey! -Geetha one minute, we'll be back. -Hey, come here... -Hey! Why did you fall like that? -That's a skid. Skid? Hey, skids are performed on bikes, not on this waste scooter. Hey, say anything to me, but not to my scooter. Do you know, it will stop before the fuel station but never asks me to toe it. -Because I toe it. -Hey, leave all this. I have found my wife as you said. -Wife? -Hmm... Who is it? Look, there she is. [dialogue muted] -The blue dress, girl? -Yeah. -Are you sure? -Yeah. -Get lost! -Hey, hey! -What happened, dude? -That blue dress girl is rich kid. Do you know, how many xerox shops do they own in Padmavathi Complex? You won't even find auto from Chintal Basti to their house. Hey, those are not the obstacle for pure love. Hey, stupid! That doesn't work, dude. -Those all happened, dude. -What did happen? Like you told the sky turned red, the earth trembled, birds started chirping, changes in the body and that bizarre sound also came. -Is it? -Yes. -But it didn't rain, right? -How many things happened to you both? -Um... -Come on, say it... Come on... -It started raining... -Come on, say it. -Ah... dogs barked. -Look, you got two and I got three, -that means I am great. -Hey! [thunders rumbling] [breaks squeaking] "Suhasini..." "You look awesome" "You look better than..." "Sridevi" "With those eyes which shoot golden arrows..." "... you pierced my heart my love" "You made my heart Bay of Bengal" "Would it be nice if you make tides flow?" "Waiting to see your beautiful smile" "Waiting to get lost in your sweet memories" "As soon as it's dawn, my heart seeks to hear your voice" "At night your memories are filled in my eyes" "Suhasini..." "You look awesome" "You look better than..." "Sridevi" [cricket crittering] [gasps] It's 12 o'clock. -Hey, Prashant, give me that laser. -Hey! Wait! -Which we purchased at the fair. -Hey, what are you pulling? -Come, come... Come out, come out. -Hey! Hey! -Rascal! Are you calling spirits? Damn! -Shut up! What the hell! -Hey, she is coming, sit down... Sit. -Hey, wait! Wait, I am sitting. -Press it, press it... -Wait, man! [mouthing] Hi! Hey, wait! Hey! Come [laughing] Hey! Yea! [laughs] -Look, over there. -Take that. What? Huh? What did you keep? I thought Amrutha will start loving me by seeing all this. And thought to drink this on this occasion. Now, drink it with sorrow. Hey, one will drink if he is a love failure. But he won't ask the other guy to drink. -I am hurt. -Then, drink, dude. I don't have the habit, dude. Hey, long back you threw up after having cheap liquor. -You are torturing me, now? -Hey, not that! I am fixed, I don't want Amrutha. She isn't in my life any more. -I arranged this paying 5,000/- -[shushes] -I mortgaged my scooter for money. -Shut up! Let that fossil be gone. -Hey! -Don't say anything to my scooter. -Ah! [sighs] -That day, whatever you said was right. It didn't rain, nothing happened, I only committed unnecessarily. -I and her... -Dev, Dev? Dev... This is your love failure moment, dude. Celebrate the pain, man. Yeah! Have one. Hey, what? Hey... Hey! Hey! [glass bulb shatters] -Happy birthday to you... -[clapping] Happy birthday to dear Ammu! Evening at 6 o'clock? Or tomorrow morning at 5 o'clock? Ah, my friend Prashant is here talk to him once. -Speak, dude. -Who is it? Hello? Personal loan? The hell with you! Cut the call! Do you talk to customer care guys this much? That is why people ignore you. Ammu, it's getting late, shall we leave for the class? Let us go later. -It's okay, even if we miss the class. -Why? That idiot is there. Who? The guy with curly hair. Hey, he is my childhood friend. He is very decent. [tuts] What would you know? How much he is torturing me. What happened? Last night, he came to the open ground which is in front of my house, irritated me... ... and broke the street light there. No... No... No... I don't believe it. He is very nice guy. He never goes behind girls. Is it? Just wait and watch. I will prove what type of guy he is. I think because Rakhi festival is close. Hey, don't hit me there, I have commitments. I thought of treating her like a queen. -She is here. -Oh no! I am deleting Amrutha. Next I will try a new girl. This is the page of my promise. The sky is blue, my heart is you... -What? -It's Geetha, dude. Hmm... Did you see, how decent he is? You didn't believe it when I said it. [tuts] This is so insulting. I don't know why this happened. Definitely, I will prove it to you. Give me, his number. [message notification rings] Hey, someone texted 'hi'. Huh? Reply them with 'bye'. [notification tone rings] How are you, dear? -Huh? Give it to me. -Hey! I am typing a message wait, dude. I am doing mind blowing, super. How are you doing? Tell me, please... Please... [tuts] [notification tone rings] Insufficient funds? -Ah... -Did you finish it all? That is, I have sent a message to Geetha saying, -'the sky is blue, my heart is you'. -Idiot! I should wait till 12 o'clock tonight to send a message. -Waste fellow! -Hey, some call... -Some call centre guys might have sent it -Get lost. -You are jealous of me. -Hey, it's call centre guys, dude. Dear, dear... Dear, you are a-- [mobile rings] Why is Geetha calling me at this time? Did Prashant got caught by any chance? Hello, Geetha, I and Prashant studied till now, he just left home. Enough of your acting. Prashant went out with his family and he informed me. Is it? Then, why did you call me? Nothing, today you received a message in the afternoon, right? Message? Which message? Didn't you receive any message from an unknown number? Did I get any? I think I might have received it. Do you know who it is? Why didn't you reply? That is, many people asks me questions related to subject, I have left it in that flow, Geetha. Are you telling me about your studies? I told her that you'd be studying at this time. To 'her'? -Is she a girl? -Yes, why? Geetha... Do one thing... Tell her not to disturb texting me now, I will text her after 12 o'clock-- I mean, after I finish studying I will text her. -Fine. -By the way, what's her name? Hello? What's her name? Hey, Prashant! You finished all the message balance, man! Oh, my God! I have to wait another 2 hours. God is great! Two hours to go. [alarm ringing] My messages got activated. Hi, respected dear. I don't generally respond to everyone, but because Geetha told me, for the first time in my life I am replying to an unknown number. Don't tell this to anyone in the college. Because a lot of girls text me daily and disturb me. Is it too much? Who else would say about us, except ourselves? [notification tone rings] [chuckles] I am not just decent, but more than that. Studies are my first priority, family comes second. [notification tone rings] Finally I've found a girl! Is he really decent guy? Let's test him. Umah! [notification tone rings] U, M, A, H? Uma H? Uma Shankar Rao... He might be her father. Uma Shankar Rao, is your father? Umm... Shall we meet tomorrow? [notification tone rings] Looks like I am going to get a new lover. Geetha, he messaged me after midnight like you said. I really found him so innocent. You know, when I texted 'umah', he asked 'who is Uma H?' -Thank you anyway, good night. -Good night. Why is she here? If she sees me with a new girl... I will love anyone sincerely, why should I fear? If she comes and questions me, I should ask her 5,000/- which costed me for the lighting. Hi! Don't you want to give me a shake hand? -Are you so angry on me? -Me? You texted me normally last night, and trying to show attitude when I came? Night... Was I chatting with you whole night? I thought it was some other girl. Why do you look so dull? It's our first meeting. Let's make it memorable. Actually, I didn't sleep properly the whole night. So, sweet. Even I didn't. -So, hot. -Naughty. Geetha told me, that you are very decent. Um... Um... [chuckles] I mean, a rich girl like you-- -Huh? -Do you know, people don't believe that, I made a girl like you, fall in love with me? Dev... I want to tell you something very important. When I was 5 years old, you know what happened then? -I was... -Shall we talk in Telugu? Why? What happened? Ah? If you speak Telugu the words in your heart comes to the brain from there, it comes to your throat through nerves and comes out of lips, right? So... Hmm... Fine. I loved someone in my past. Even I did in high school. It was one-sided. But because of language and caste problem, it didn't work. In my family everyone gets married early. That's better, even I am hearing weird sounds these days. -Huh? -Ah! I will ask my parents to get me married early. Actually I liked all your moments. [making hissing sounds] Especially your innocence... -and your birthday wishes. -So, cute. I love you! I love you doubles. Dev, if you don't mind shall we go for a long drive? "Be it any minute when I take the first step with you" "I'll make a tattoo of it on my heart" "I am seeking for solitude wherever I find" "Why do we need this world between us, shall I erase it?" "Wherever this journey takes me" "I will walk with you" "Whichever the endless path we reach" "I will give you my love" "I am asking you to stay" "Laying your head on my shoulder like this" "Though I am in darkness, your eyes are the trap of moonlight" "Even if we are in an ocean, sweet tides would be around us" "I would say time will come to a stand still for us" "Suhasini..." "You look awesome" "You look better than..." "Sridevi" "You look awesome" [music mutes voices] Are you going to Mangalore, Dev? Yes! It's winter, right? Here is your hot tea. Tea will always be hot. You are too much. I think you were busy all the time? Girlfriend, cricket, song, fight... Full golden days! [chuckles] College life indeed means a golden life. Those days won't come back. No need to earn nor you are answerable to some one. The real life begins after college. The game begins now. What are your hobbies? Watching cricket, placing bets and Dev's event management, sir. -Dev's event management? -It's very famous in my area, madam. We provide food and beverages for any occasion... And Vinayaka Chavithi is the speciality of our event management. From buying the statue, making the stage, prayers, dancing and the immersion is done with 'Teen Maar' dance, single-handed. If we offer you a job in our company, what will you do on working days and on weekends? I will wait the whole week for the weekend, madam. -Why? -Um... I will sacrifice my weekend for my girlfriend. That is why your attendance is poor. Yes, sir. I like your sincerity. One subject-related question. -Madam? -Yes? Ask me little easy question. Hmm... Do you know about Java? -It's my dream bike, madam. -Aha? It comes with 293 cc, 29 BHP, with one single cylinder and when the engine starts... [imitating revving sound] Body will shake, madam. Okay, one more easy question. What is command? Prashant, I asked you to keep the statue up, but why did you keep it down? I told you to buy 10 coconuts and you brought 8? Did you take the remaining money? This is command, madam. So, you are selected, you can join next week. We will send you the joining letter soon. Oh! -You are welcome, madam. -Yeah. -Welcome, sir. -Congrats. Is it a right decision? He didn't think if he know what we asked. Moreover, he is honestly saying the false answer. Work is new to everyone, right? He will learn, let's give him a chance. [mobile rings] Hey, what happened? I got the job, Ammu. Wow, I knew it. How much is the package? That is, 22-- -Just 2.2 million? This is too much, Ammu. It's 22,000/- per month. What is that? Let's try something else. There is no chance now. -Why? -I've signed the agreement. And they are saying that the company is in problems, God himself appeared with the name Dev, Ammu. There will be a hike every 6 months, right? Anyone will give it. Don't worry thinking this salary is less for your talent. I don't know what your innocence will do to me, Ammu. Fine, now hang up, I will come and meet you in the evening. Congrats again, bye. Whom are you congratulating, Ammu? To a friend, mummy. He got hired in campus interview. Aha! What's the package? It's 22,000/- Just 22,000/- How can they survive with that? Rents, bills, expenditure, commitments. [scoffs] How'd you know? You swipe 1 lakh just like that if you go out for shopping. -Is it really hard? -It's very hard. You can't and you aren't grown like that. Our salary decides how our life should be. You were raised like a princess here. After your marriage you should be like a queen. You are an intelligent girl. You chose your way. I hope you will not let us down. I was worried thinking Prashant would get more salary than me. Even he got the same salary. Even Geetha got the job in our campus. Everyone together-- What happened, Ammu? Are you sad because we are going to Bangalore? -Hmm... -[in Kannada] Don't worry, Ammu. [in Kannada] If you are ready then just tell me I will refer you in my company. Oh, my God! Bangaloreans will get shocked listening to my Kannada. I am going to rock! -Just 20,000/-... -It's 22,000/- Yeah, I thought you'd get a minimum of one lakh. I already had done the inquiry, Ammu. I will get paid double salary if I do two shifts. Dev, you will get well settled, right? If I didn't get settled then no one needs to study engineering. Do you know they can close the colleges? You will come to Hyderabad to meet me at least two times a month, right? I will come once in a week. If needed I will do daily up and down to Hyderabad and Bangalore. Alright? In our home town, in our friends circle we are hero. Once we cross our town, or come to Bangalore for a living. Our life starts from a zero. Even summer feels like winter in Bangalore. We need to pay minimum 11 months advance to rent a house here. I and Prashant live in same room, on the same bed, under the same blanket. I promised Amrutha that I'll give her a better life than her parents. Luxurious life may depend upon my fate. But we must earn for comfortable life. Day and night, double shifts, over time... Oh! I started working all shifts. Some times I was unsure if it was day or night. If I sleep it's night and if I wake up it's morning. My income would do for a month in the beginning... "Eventually I was able to save some money". I bought a car which Amrutha wished for. Well it was not a costly nor a posh car, But I have purchased a cute used car. I purchased own car in my life with my money. Wow! You must have seen the satisfaction on my face that day. You can't see that happiness in the face a person who bought a flight. [dialogue muted] -Hey, Nidhi! Hi! -Hi! -How are you? -Good. -Hey, she is Geetha's teammate. -Oh! -He is. -Dev... Satya Dev. -Hi! -Hi! -He's the James Bond of Hyderabad. -Oh! -[laughs] -Hey! -Thank God, she didn't say Super-Man. -Our childhood friend. Who wears his briefs out-- Okay, okay. What are your plans for Hyderabad? I should go, dude. It's 14th -and she would be waiting. -Ah! Wow! -What are your plans, Nidhi? -[sighs] Office is my boyfriend. Hey, guys, I forgot to tell you, we have completed seven years of our relationship on the 24th of this month. -[crying] -Oh, wow! Really? Oh, wow! -We will give a party. For you both. -Congrats. He will come anyway, but you, -you must come for sure. -Done. It's the same in our house Geetha, even if it's been 10 years that my grandpa passed, still, we serve food that day. [laughing] Ah, sorry. You... You know about him, right? -Hey, don't crack stupid jokes. -Sorry, sorry. Ignore him, you know, right? Unnecessarily I helped you for Amrutha. Aha! Who is Amrutha? Answer her, dude. -Feeling shy? Aha! Come on, say it. -Stop it! -Mm-Hmm... -It's my girlfriend. Girlfriend? Girlfriend? -Aha! Is it? -Hey, I am leaving. [indistinct chatter] Hi, Ammu! -Happy valentines day! -Happy valentines day! Here you go. Ammu, I told you right, that I took a car. -Yeah, one second. -Okay. Did you see, she has a BMW... [scoffs] and he came in a small car. [laughing] Hello, brother! Hi, brother. What's up, brother? Valentine's day celebrations, huh? Yeah, why are you all enjoying together on valentines day? We got no girlfriend brother being so smart. Rather than chit-chatting, go for a round you will also get. Super, Ammu! Happy valentines day! Ammu, you didn't say how's my car. Mmm... It's good. Dev, I am so hungry. Let's go eat somewhere? Um... Shall we go in our car? Even you can drive. No need. Let us go in my car. You drive it. Huh? Look I will teach him a lesson now. Oh, God! It's okay, even if you don't give me a girlfriend. But please gift him a rich car, God. You know this is completely automatic. Dad's gift. Can you guess the cost? [sighs] Where shall we go? Umm... Novotel! There will be special arrangements for Valentines day. -Novotel? -Hmm... That's very expensive, Ammu. Let's go to Paradise. It won't cost more than 1,000/- no matter how much we eat. Please... What? Are you calculating for food too? That too on valentines day? I should, Ammu. I am still getting settled, right? I should save every penny for us. How much will you save? How long will you save? Will you come after I become old... and tell that I am completely settled? Are you serious? Already I am getting good proposals. How many should I avoid? And you are calculating for everything here. Fine, sorry. Now what? You want to go to Novotel, right? Let's go. Why do you get upset about every matter, Ammu? Are you trying to do me a favour? You promised me a lot. You said that you would get settled in no time. Ammu... I am working hard, right? For our sake. No, need. You don't have to work hard for my sake. You got a raise from 22,000 to 28,000 hardly till now. And today, you bought some used car. What's the point now? I should have thought about it, before I fell for you. Huh! My bad time! Bad fate! BENGALURU Last night Ammu called me. It seems, Dev behaved cheaply. -Do you believe her? -[tuts] He won't do. But... Looks like... Uh-huh! It doesn't seem like it will work. [tuts] -Hello? -Dev, are you awake? What do you mean, bloody fool! I am already with Ammu. -[scoffs] -When did you go? -Hey, why are you asking? -Hyderabad... -What? -We're busy, don't disturb I'll call you. Bye. It's Prashant... He is worried that we had a fight. Sorry, Dev. [sighs] I am so done Ammu. You fight with me when we meet. When I leave you, you call me in the morning and cry. Sorry, Dev... I got angry. You know, right? I can't live without you. Shucks! Don't talk like that. -Leave it. -No! I did a mistake, right? Give me a punishment, please. Look, Ammu... You stop telling me to get settled all the time. It's life Ammu, it will take some time, right? Understand. Fine, are you still angry on me? [sighs] When did I get angry on you? [chuckles] So, sweet. Hey, I am coming to Bangalore next Saturday. -For my cousin's wedding. -Is it? Same day Geetha and Prashant are throwing a party as it's their 7th anniversary. Ammu, they will feel happy if you come, please. Not this time. Mom and dad are also coming. Get them both. Dev, it wouldn't work, leave it. Hey, what 'leave'? I will bring them to you then wish them. -Dev, it's not possible. -It's possible, okay. End of the topic. [cicadas chirping] Hello? Ammu... I am outside, can you come out? Okay, bye. Won't you introduce me to her? Huh? [chuckles] Please, no... Actually Ammu is little possessive. If she sees you now, she will argue with me later. Moreover, you aren't like Geetha, you look good, so... Ouch! Ah! And... You think their pair is good, right? You should watch our pair, you will get stunned. -Okay. -I'll bring her here. -Go, you go... -Yeah. [wedding percussions] -Hi, Ammu! -Dev... Is she her? I asked you not to come, right? Ammu, Geetha, and Prashant are also here. Let's wish them, come on. Huh! Are you mad? What if someone sees us? Here, I have brought you a chocolate to cool you down. Wow, chocolate? Disgusting! You have become so irritating these days, Dev. You come when I don't want you to come and do you think, giving me a bar of chocolate is a surprise? Just leave now! [mobile rings] -Hello? -I can't take it any more, Dev. I am going crazy. Seeing this function my parents are asking me about my marriage. They even introduced me to a guy. I had to talk to him. By seeing the things you do, I feel that my parents are right. Now, what happened, Ammu? I don't think this will workout, Dev. Ammu, don't take mad decisions in anger. What happened, now? I came even after you said not to. -Sorry, Ammu. -I am also sorry, Dev. I told my dad that I will marry him. -Let's end it here. -Ammu? Hello? Ammu? [ringer] The number you are trying to reach is currently switched off. To leave a voice message press star followed by... Hey, Dev! Still how many days will you stay like this? Stop thinking about her. You are becoming mad, do you understand? It's been 3 months, she is not talking. She doesn't even reply to my messages, she doesn't answer my calls. I don't understand what to do, dude. [tuts] She told you clearly. That she will marry someone else. She left you, dude. How can she do that? Is she mad? She will die without me. -I feel like I'll die if she doesn't talk. -Don't act-- Don't talk rubbish. What should I do then? How much we planned, how to live life etc... You are also seeing it, right? How much I am working hard day and night? Prashant, don't you know, how much do I like Ammu? She can't live without me. Something happened. I think her parents changed her mind. What do you say? Buddy! Things won't work out between you both. Will you do the same thing if it was Geetha? Ah? Fine! Tell me, what shall we do? Hey, it's Ammu's birthday tomorrow, if we meet once, everything will get solved. No, please listen to me. Hey, we will become normal if we meet, I know, please. What if she don't? If not I will do whatever you ask me to do. Will you do anything I say? I will do whatever you ask me to do, promise! Fine. Thanks, dude. Everything will settle down if you are with me. -Mmm... -Thank you. Hey, dude, is she coming? I have messaged her, she will come. [tuts] [sighs] [mobile rings] -Hello, Prashant. -Once check where Ammu is. You people started morning itself? Listen to me, Geetha, please, make it fast. Fine. [phone beeps] [mobile rings] Hello? Hi, Geetha! Happy birthday. Thanks Geetha. Where are you? I am in Anantagiri temple. -Fine, I will call you later. Bye. -Bye. [mobile rings] -Hello, where is she? -It seems, she is in Anantagiri temple. Oh, God! [temple bells ringing] -Two minutes. -Okay. Hi, Ammu! Happy birthday. You didn't come at night? Did I tell you that I will come? -I messaged you, right? -Did I reply? I came here from Bangalore as it's your birthday, Ammu. Hello, many people come to Hyderabad from Bangalore. It doesn't mean I will meet everyone. How many times should I tell you? I don't want you. You are talking in anger. Let's sit somewhere and talk about this, please. I don't have time. I have already moved on. -Ammu, please. -Hey! Have you lost it? Thinks won't workout between you and me. I've realised, even you have to. Stop irritating me. Good bye! Come, let's go. Have it. What's this? It's almost been a week. Why are you so low? Does she think she is Ms. India or what? How does it matter if she is Ms. India or Ms. Kukatpalli? You shouldn't have given her his number in the first place. -Unnecessarily. -This is not right. Did I have a dream that she will dump him or what? Dev, where's your phone? Whom are you calling? I am calling her, take her to task. -Geetha don't. No Geetha-- -It's ringing. She picked up the phone. Dev, why are you calling me again and again? How many times should I tell you? If you keep doing this, I'll have to complain to my parents. No need, marry whom ever you want. You would never get a call from my mobile. No one is waiting for your call. -Scold her bro, do it. -Do it man. You must not call me either. Me? I would never call you again, mind your business. Dev, stop thinking about her dude. Give some rest to your heart and mind. If there's some problem in love, we can discuss and solve it. But, what if the lover herself is a problem? Look! Me and Geetha have chose a girl for you. We think she is a perfect match for you. Go and meet her once. Dev, you have to move on man. Start a new life. Hey! You said you'll do whatever I say if Amrutha says no. Didn't you? So you mean you made false promise? I need some time dude. Hey! I only asked you to talk to her... ... but not to marry and get settled with her. Go and talk to her, else stop talking to me. Does that Prashant have any common sense? How can they ask you to meet a girl before recovering from the breakup? I promised Prashant that I would obey his words. To be honest... I wasn't ready. I just don't know why did I go to meet her on that day. When life wasn't what I wished for... But I understood that I have to go where ever life takes me. Nidhi? Why did she come here? Hi! Hi! Nidhi! Any office party? -Am I late? -Late? Dev? Not at all. I arrived a bit early. What would you like to have? Hmm! A soup. Okay, soup it is. -Boss. -Sir. Two soups. Which soup you want sir? -Broccoli? -Okay, broccoli. Okay ma'am. [mobile ringing] -Hello. -Did Nidhi come? Did you give her the bouquet? Do it fast man. -Why didn't you say it was Nidhi? -Shut up bro. It was a office call. What else? Oh no. Huh! Wow! So beautiful! Thank you. What else? Hmm? I just got a bouquet for you. Not the bouquet. I am casually asking. What else? Oh! Well, who else are there in your family? I live alone. My parents died while I was a child. -Oh! -I was raised in Mangalore by my granny. Here, I live in a PG accommodation. You know it all, right? What? Of course I do. Well, I just asked because I had to reply to your question. [mobile ringing] Office call. -Hello. -Did you give her the bouquet? -I did. -Give her the ring and propose to her. -You! Just a minute some escalation. -Okay. Hey! How can I give her a ring now? Are you out of your mind? Hey! Just do as I say. Why didn't you tell me it was Nidhi? What would you do if I had said it, tell me? She is a good lady man. Dude, that's why I am asking you to marry her. Just give her the ring. Me and Nidhi? She is so beautiful man. She is out of my range bro. [in Hindi] When God intends to give you something, it will be like this. -Do as I say... Geetha is calling hang up. -Listen to me Prashant. There's a release scheduled so-- Did Prashant release the news? Sir, here's your soup. -Thank you! -You are welcome ma'am. Actually I want to tell you something. I have a very bad past and I want to-- Can you please speak in Telugu if you don't mind? I feel I am talking to a stranger if you talk in English. But if you speak in Telugu it feels like we are talking to our own people. -I think... You're aware of my past. -Yes. I'm not sure if I came out of it. Geetha and Prashant shared a lot of good things about you. Even I realised, in few days of our friendship. So... I want to... Marry you. What? Or else, will you marry me? Damn! Take your time. Prashant won't feel bad even if you reject me after some days. -What? -Who is he to feel bad? Sorry, Geetha! I'm so tensed. Geetha? Nidhi? You're Nidhi. The broccoli is getting cold. Looks like he gave only few pieces, right? One second. Brother, the soup is getting cold, you only served few pieces. Is it office call? How can you propose to her just because Prashant told you to? If you had waited you might have found a better woman? And what's wrong with Amrutha? What's her problem? Why did she call you again? What? Okay I am coming. Hello tell me, where are you going? The nature is calling, it's winter season right? Okay, come soon. Keep talking to me, turn that side. Okay. Gosh! Just in a single day? Lord Sai Ram! I prayed to Goddess Katta Maisamma that you should settle down in life. Take good care of Nidhi and live happily. I am really happy for both of you. No one should interfere in your life from here on. Ammu called me today. -Dev, why aren't you calling me? -Why should I? Finally, you have realised at least now, don't ever call me again. Has she lost it? What's her problem? Leave it. [message notification] What's wrong with that woman? Is it Ammu again? -It's Nidhi. -Oh! You came just now and she started messaging? Looks like she is missing you a lot. -Wow man! -She texted to find out if I reached home. [both] Woow! The real love story begins now. -Nothing like that. -He is moving like Shatabdi express train. -You keep chatting, let's leave. -Hey, remain seated. -Why should we sir? -Let's go, bye. Hey lover boy, keep going. Bye! [mobile ringing] Hey... Hey... Bro it's Nidhi. Nidhi is calling. -Hello. -Hi, were you sleeping? I am so sorry. Please sleep. It's okay, tell me. When would you start to office tomorrow? I must be in office by 9:30 AM. Okay, I will come to pick you up by 8:30 AM. -Sweet dreams! Good night. -Good night. Tell me what did she say? Just tell me dude. Come on man. She said she'll pick me up to go to office tomorrow. Wow! Sounds great. These many days you suffered because of that foolish woman. Dude Chary, the planets are moving positively in your calender. Enjoy. She even apologised for disturbing my sleep. If you say sorry for a mistake that you haven't done for so many days... ... and now someone is saying sorry, it's like you have a new feeling. What's up? Dude, do these kind of women exist? Of course they do, rarely you get to meet them. Like our elders used to say, you must be lucky to find one. -What? This is it dude. This is it. -Hey, buddy no. Stop it. -Good morning. -Hi! Good morning. Hi! -You said you will bring your car? -This is my car, it's a small car... -Don't you like it? -No it's cute, like a puppy. Do you mind wearing the seat belt? What? Actually the roads are empty and I drive very fast. Oh! Okay. -Need some help? -It's okay. I have a doubt. If we crash into some one by any chance... ... would they publish in the news that it was a car accident? Did you eat? I will eat in the canteen. Take this. The tissues are there and here is the water bottle. Stop eating outside from today, I will bring you food. Shall we start? Okay. Dev, if you ignore me because of Nidhi... ... I will stab you. Are you mad? Nidhi came into my life recently. You are my life since childhood. Would I do that? Idiot. [mobile ringing] Hello Nidhi. -Where are you? -I am in the canteen. Oh! Are you having lunch? I thought both of us will have lunch together. No! I'm just looking at Prashant while he's eating. -Coming down for lunch? -Sure, I will come. -Okay Bye. -Yeah. Sorry bro. Like Prakash Raj, you have many shades. [voices muted] Stop here. Thank you Nidhi, for the lift. Ah! Do you have any urgent work? Nothing as such. Do you have any work? Nothing, I just wanted to talk to you for some time. I am free, tell me. What else? The word 'What else' changed my life that day. I'll remove the seat belt... -we can talk freely. -Okay. So... [voice muted] What ever I ate got digested by talking for so long. I am hungry, shall we eat? Yes! Let's eat pani puri. Um! I think you are getting late, you can go now. Aah! Actually, I don't have anything to do by going home. I won't sleep off early either. You said you are hungry, let's go. -Sure? -Yeah! Bro! Bro! [in Kannada] Give me one plate pani puri. [in Kannada] Who is it? Give me one plate pani puri. Empty! [in Kannada] Bro, first time I came out with her... [in Kannada] Please, it's a prestige issue. -Are you Telugu guy? -Yes. Speak in Telugu, everyone around can speak Telugu here. Is it? Give one plate pani puri please. -Your lover? -No. -A friend? -No. Then who? I made her wear a ring. Ring? A ring! So you are engaged, right? Yes. Give me one plate pani puri. I'll give only one plate, you should not ask me again. Okay. One plate is enough. -Wow! You really are a specialist. -Take it. Mmm! Mmm! -How is it? -Yummy! Shall I order one more plate? -Yes. -Hey, that's the last plate. It's alright. -Are you leaving? -What? No... I thought we could talk comfortably if I remove the seat belt. It's okay, you can leave if you are uncomfortable. No... No... No, in fact I am enjoying your company. -Is it? -Yes. Even I am, I don't know how time is passing by talking with you. -Is it? -Yes. -The pani puri was great right? -Yes, I enjoyed it. The food which doesn't bore me is pani puri. I love it so much that I can have it for breakfast, lunch and dinner. In fact I take pani puri for my grandma when ever I go to Mangalore. Oh! I didn't tell you about my grand parents, right? My grand parents used to live in Mangalore. Of course they are no more. They've built a beautiful house for themselves on a tiny island. Even I have a dream to build a small home opposite their home. Are you feeling sleepy? Who would sleep at 2 AM? [yawning] No one would. The weather in Mangalore is so good. The trees, the weather... You won't come back if you go there. I know, you won't feel like it. Happy days. Dev! Dev? I don't like woman who are talkative. A woman should be like me, decent and silent. Isn't it or not? Why don't you answer me? -Did you pay him? -I paid him, let's go. Who's Nidhi, what type of a girl is she? Not knowing any thing about her, how did you propose? Most men do it on a coffee date if a girl is good looking. Isn't my way better than that? But you could have taken some time after breaking up with Amrutha. Hmm! I could've... But after breaking up with Ammu, every day seemed to be like ten years. The time we've spent, those talks, those memories made me feel like I am in hell. But once Nidhi came into my life... Like some magic happened, those slowly memories faded away. For the first time, I was being myself. What ever, you are happy right? -Yes. -Tell me what happened next. After that. That day, it was my birthday. Nidhi! What happened? Hmm! She is gorgeous. [men speaking in Kannada] [speaking in Kannada] [speaking in Kannada] [groaning in pain] Dev! That's enough, come back. I never thought that you could fight so well. You know, I brought this cake with lots of love? It got spoiled. -One second. -Huh! [voices muted] Nidhi! Hey! That's a lovely cake! Shall we cut it? Blow the candle. -Happy Birthday Dev! -Thank you! -Nidhi! -Yes. I actually wanted to ask you some thing. Go ahead. You know about my ex, right? Then why did you accept my proposal? I heard that you loved her sincerely. Even though she troubled you, you remained patient, right? Didn't you sleep in a football ground for her all night in Hyderabad? -Who told you? -Geetha and Prashant. Oh! Though she troubled you, if you can love her so much... I accepted because I felt you would love a good girl like me even more. Nidhi! -Can I take a photograph of that ring? -Yes. Will you keep it as your WhatsApp DP? Hmm! Yes. [tuts] [mobile ringing] I made a mistake by introducing him to Nidhi. [mobile ringing] Dude, answer the call. He wont let me sleep at nights and in the morning as well. You change that ring tone first. Hi baby! Happy Birthday! I know that you've been waiting for my call... I am coming to Bangalore to surprise you. I'll share the location as soon as I reach, come down. I want to endure that glow in your eyes, as soon as you see me. Bye! -Who was that? -Dude, it was Ammu. -Ammu? -Yes. Are you planning to meet her or what? Baby, say something. She came all the way from Hyderabad, it won't be good if he doesn't go. Hello, she is in crocked mood like Neelambari... If he goes now, she will stick to him like a leech. Later on you both will have to cry together. It's alright Dev, go and meet her. I don't understand your confidence. If he had decided to go, he wouldn't have told us. But he told us, which means he is confused. Things will fall into place if you meet her. Go on. Happy Birthday Dev! For me? You are angry right? I know it. I have a lot to talk to you. Come let's go. Umm! Shall we go to a restaurant to talk. Ah! No to the restaurant, let's talk in the car. Hmm! Let's talk in your car. Not in my car, let's talk in your car. Tell me. Dev, why are you uncomfortable? Nothing. Seriously? Hmm! Okay, give me your hand. -Why? -Just give it. [tuts] This is how you should hold a girls hand. Okay? Okay now take a picture. [tuts] Take na. Dev, you don't want to take a picture with me? You don't even want to sit besides me right? Dev, I was naive, I pained you with my words. I insulted you. I know it's my mistake. Your anger is right... Tell me what punishment you will give, I am ready for it. Hit me if you feel like. But don't say that you don't need me any more Dev. Please. You were the one who always said sorry for my mistake these many days. Now it's my turn, I am really sorry Dev. Give me one chance, please. I will never hurt you again. If I do it again, it's up to you this time. Ammu... I need some time. Let me think. Please Dev, don't you think I deserve one more chance with you? Her crying and saying sorry, all this is a drama. She is a drama queen. -Don't trust her Dev. -You'll suffer if you give her a chance. Don't insist him. Let him decide. Dev, if Ammu is still in your heart... ... if you feel like you still love her, live with her. It's not even three months since I came into your life. But your love with Amrutha is from four years. Think well and take a good decision. You should not regret your decision later on. What about you? I will feel bad, it will take time for me to recover. But being in love means to fulfil the dreams of your loved one right? [mobile ringing] What's your decision Dev? Her name is Nidhi. She likes me a lot. No, I like Nidhi even more. Just because you came back, I can't leave her. Oh! So you can cheat me? You forgot me already and fell in love with another girl so fast? I am fool for saying sorry to you. Did you tell her about me or else are you playing with her too? Oh God! I can't believe you did this to me. I'm such a fool! I'm ashamed that I was in love with you all these days. You are such a cheat. -I can't even-- -Hey... ... speak in Telugu. What, you are ashamed that you were in love with me? You are not ashamed for being in love with me. But because of my pay, the gifts I gave and about my middle class status. You don't even like to sit in my car. How will you share your life with me? You and your parents won't be able digest the food which is not from a 5 star hotel. Aren't people like us who eat in normal hotels humans? You are trying to show off on my birthday today... ... what did you say when I came to Hyderabad on your birthday? You treated me worst than a dog. What's the point in saying sorry now? Look Ammu, you were my world when I was in love with you. I studied hard for you... ... I got campus placement for you, I've worked hard day and night for you. Even though I couldn't impress you. Only then I understood that you and me are different. I can't live in your world Ammu. Good bye! [cheering for Dev] -Dev! Super. -Dude... -I never knew you had this angle. -You did the right thing. You should have done it long time ago. The five star and low star thing was great. Even the God himself can't separate you both. Really! Did you scold her on the phone? While in a relation we can tolerate any kind of trouble. Once we are out of it, we will get annoyed by a single wrong word. May be this is love psychology. More over Ammu had hurt my ego. I was frustrated that day. Poor Ammu. Let her rot. Your reaction was right for the sort of pain she gave you. But I find Nidhi even more interesting. She got food for you, she made you feel comfortable, she got a cake for you. She even let you meet your ex- girl friend. That is what is puzzling me. Being a girl it's hard for me to believe that a girl can be so perfect. Isn't it? Even I had the same doubt. Is it? You are supposed to get that doubt. What did you do next? -Later in confusion-- -In confusion? -Nidhi! -Nidhi? I married her. What? Does any one get married in confusion? Men are like that... ... either they get married in confusion or they get confused after marriage. Well it's a curse to mankind. Poor Divya. -Who is Divya? -It's me. -Oh! -You said you are single. But now you are saying you got married. Hello, before I could say something you imagined about right or wrong. On top of it you said you know face reading, nose bleeding and so on. I didn't want to disappoint you, so I encouraged you. I thought you would whistle at me, but now it's like a cooker is whistling. [tuts] Bad time, that's it. I must tell you some thing important. So the marriage is not true, right? [tuts] It's about my first night with her. About your first night? Would any one talk about that? They wouldn't, but I have to tell you about my first night. I can never forget it. Oh no, why are you trying to touch my feet? I was keeping the milk glass on the table. Milk glass? Sit down. Aren't you interested? I mean no. Aren't you? I mean not no, I am interested. -Is it? -Yes. You men have certain dreams and expectations about a first night, right? At such young age? I was not that young but sort of young. Oh! What else? Nothing much, that's it. That's it? You mean, we are supposed to sit away from each other through out the night? Oh! I am sorry. I think this is not new to you? No... No, this is my first time. You mean you did nothing till this day? It's not like that, just a little bit of romance. You mean, you did it? I mean I didn't do the whole thing. How would you do it now? I used to watch it on internet with friends. CD's, DVD's and stuff. One minute, I will be back in a jiffy. Dev, you got caught. That's why I told you not to fall in love before marriage. Or else you should marry the one whom you was in love with. Look now, can you do this, can you do like that... Is it necessary? [scoffs] No problem Dev, remember your cricket ground for once. Hmm! [all hailing Dev] Yes! That's the spirit. That's the spirit my boy. You can do it. Come on. Victory is ours. [humming] [humming] "Dear winter season..." [humming] "Oh passing cloud..." "Slip down like a sweet drizzle" "As a sweetest memory" "Join with us" "Though we take steps separately" "No matter what the journey towards you does to me" "Dear winter season..." "Oh passing cloud..." "As a sweetest memory" "Join with us" "Deprived of love for so long" "Did I wait for you all these days?" "The journey which goes beautifully" "It will not stop even for 10 centuries" "The time gave up" "The world can't walk forward if we stop here" "Dear winter season..." "Dear winter season..." "Oh passing cloud..." "As a sweetest memory" "Join with us" [indistinct voices over TV] [retches] Will you have one more plate of pani puri? You would never listen to me. [Telugu film playing on TV] Mmm... You always ask me for pani puri. Now look what happened. Don't curse pani puri, it's not because of that. Hmm... I asked you to eat some healthy food, I think it's because of that. Not because of that. Hmm... I think it's because I fed you. No. Then it could be because you married someone like me. Hmm... Yes, may be. You won't stop passing satires. What? Really? [dialogue muted] -Good morning. -Good morning, Nidhi. -Are you preparing tea? -Hmm... Can you prepare it for me too? -I am making it for you. -Thank you. Hmm... Why did you get ready? Even I am getting late for the office. -Why didn't you wake me up early? -Nidhi! -Huh? -From today you are not going to office. You are going to take rest sitting at home. Why should I quit? I am alright. Nidhi, don't argue for everything. Sometimes you need to listen to me too. -Have it. -Is this how you treat your pregnant wife? Nidhi? Mmm. But you will take the tea. Smell is good. What happened now? Won't anyone get pregnant in the world? Everyone works till 7th month. Recently Smithi my colleague... She directly went for delivery from office. You are locking me up at home without discussing with me, that means, you have some affair. That is why you are locking me up at home with such plans. Are you done? Can I speak? Nidhi... It's all unnecessarily to me, that they worked till 7th month or they directly went for giving birth. You are important to me. That is why I asked you to quit your job, there is no other reason. You are fooling me and I know that. Nidhi, do you need stress, timelines, deadlines of your job? Who are there for me except you? -Happily take rest being at home. -I get bored at home. Nidhi! Nidhi please... For ourselves. -Will you bring me anything I ask? -Hmm... If I ask for pani puri will you get them? I will get the whole set up for you. Okay. [voice muted] What's up, Satya? Nidhi, I will call you later. Looks like you are so happy. Sir, I didn't tell you this, but I am going to become a father. -Oh, that's awesome! Congratulations! -Thank you. By the way, I also have a good news for you. -Sir? -You got promoted as a team leader. Thank you, sir. But, it's a new project. You will have to put in extra effort and work. -And you will be paid well for it. -Thank you, sir. -Congratulations and all the best. Bye. -Thank you so much. [mobile rings] Huh? -Hello? -Nidhi! I have a surprise from my side. Did you quit your job? Hey, I got a promotion. Fine, congrats. Why are you congratulating me so palely? I have climbed a couple of steps in my job. Stay there taking few more steps. Don't even come home. -Are you getting bored? -I will hit you if I catch you. I am getting bored at home. Fine, you get ready let us go for lunch. Lunch? Where? Indian, continental, South Indian, -North Indian, Chinese, Italian. -You sit up listening about lunch. How do you know that I got up? I know it, do one thing... Invite Prashant and Geetha, let us give our surprises there. What might be the surprise party about? I think he is planning to give me a surprise about his promotion. But I will surprise him instead. They are coming. Something is written on their t-shirts. 'Mommy and Daddy?' -Wow! -Mommy and daddy? -Hey! -Hey! Is it true? No, we brought in a offer sale. -Wow! Congratulations Dev. -Thanks, man! -I am happy for you. -Thank you. Yes, I am going to become a father. I got promoted as well. The life is moving happily like I thought. But... [mobile rings] Because of the work pressure, day and night shifts and because of the releases, I couldn't give time to Nidhi whom I love so much. [dialogues muted] [mobile rings] [mobile ringing continues] [footsteps] What happened? Did anyone say some thing to you? Who are there to say something? Sorry, Nidhi... I am loaded with work at office. Calls, clients, project meetings. Now we are two. Soon we are going to become three. I should work hard, right? A car... a house... comfort life... If we want all these, we need money right? That is why... Don't you want me? You will earn money if you work hard. Everything you said will come true. But when will you give me your time? Without you, how can it be comfort life for me. I don't need anything. Nor this money. I just need you. I need to spend time with you happily. If you work hard to live happily in future, that day won't come. I need you today... This second. Will you stay with me? Please... Hmm... -Sorry. -It's okay. Dev... What is this? I got your mail saying you don't want the promotion? Why are you talking such decision when your career is growing? Don't you think it is wrong? Damn it! It's your future. Sorry, sir. I have taken this decision for us. -I am sorry. -Up to you. Geetha, where are you? I and Prashant came out, what's up? I am completely ready. What's the plan and what is the surprise? Surprise? Oh, it's your birthday tomorrow, right? Yeah... Dev didn't tell anything to me... Where is he? Is it? I think he will be in office at this time. But he is coming late everyday. Maybe I think he'd come at 12 o'clock and surprise me. [door opens] Hey, I think he is here, stay on line. Okay, okay. [door closes] Nidhi, I am hungry, I will go get freshen up, okay? I think we are going out for dinner. He said he will freshen up. Okay, I will call you later, bye. Okay, okay... Bye. -Huh? -Where are you going? You said you are hungry so we are going out for dinner. Hey, why going out daily. Come let's have it at home. What happened? Why aren't you eating? Nothing. Shall I feed you? -I will eat. -Eat. Nidhi! Why are you sitting? It's already late, sleep now. [mobile rings] -Hello? -Hey, Nidhi! Where are you? Are you both partying hard? -We are at home. -At home? Did you cut the cake? There is no cake nothing. What is that? Where is he? He is with me, sleeping. Is he sleeping? Okay, wait... I will call him and teach a lesson. Hey, no! He just slept. Okay, bye. [mobile rings] -Yeah? -Sorry, I forgot to tell you. Happy birthday. Hmm... Thank you, Geetha! For wishing me. Huh...? What happened to her? [mobile rings] Hello, Nidhi! Many many happy returns of the day. Have an amazing year a head. -Hmm... -Hello? Nidhi, did he plan a surprise anywhere far? Yes, I am celebrating destination birthday. Oh! I have heard about destination wedding, but you are celebrating destination birthday too? -Wow! -By the way, thank you, Prashant. For wishing me, remembering my birthday. Hello, Nidhi? Why are you shouting? Is everything, fine? Hello? This crazy fellow might have did something. -[grunts] -Oh my God! Why did you hit me like that, dear? Dear? Who is your dear? -Oh God! -Someone else wishes me happy birthday. But what is your problem? Damn it! Sorry, Nidhi... Still you should have reminded me in the morning, right? I am roaming around you wearing a new dress. Have you become blind or aren't you able to see? Nidhi, control. You are using swear words in anger. Sorry, okay? Hey, I don't need your sorry. What did I do on your birthday? I came at 12 o'clock and gave you a surprise. What did you do then? You smiled showing your teeth and enjoyed it. When it is my birthday, you should have remembered it and surprise me, right? I mean, what else would be a better surprise than me... Aha? You slept on a footpath in Hyderabad on Ammu's birthday. -It was a ground. -What do you mean? I slept in a ground, right? -I will... -Hey! I know... As we are married, you lost interest on me. You men are all same. Nidhi, that is, should I say sorry or tell birthday wishes to you? Huh! I don't want your sorry. -Listen to me once. -Hey, get lost! My back is paining. [switch clicks on] Dev... Dev? Nidhi? Who did this? I think it's a marriage decoration. Hey, is anyone there? I think they decorated this for a marriage. Isn't it you, who did this? Nidhi, if I did that for them, can't I do this much for you? Happy birthday, Nidhi. Oh no! I kicked you, right? -Huh? -Is it hurting? Ah... Sort of... But the cake is about to melt. -Cake? -Come on. Do you like it? -Huh? -Hmm... It's very beautiful. [crackers bursting] I love you, Nidhi... Forever... And ever. [motor boat thumping] You made her wait for so long and got her a cake? Wow! Dev you are so romantic. I like such surprises so much. You both are really made for each other. [tuts] I feel like marrying right away listening to your love story. Tell me if you have a twin brother. Dude I am serious. I didn't had an impression on Nidhi before. But I like her so much now. I feel jealous now. But I want to meet her and give her a tight hug. Sorry, she is pregnant, right? Who is it? A girl or a boy? Okay, I will guess one last time. Don't you want me to? What happened, Dev? [groans] [ambulance siren wailing] [groans] [ambulance siren wailing] [breathing heavily] -Excuse me, Nidhi? -And you are? -I am her husband. -Oh... -She had a miscarriage. -What! She is in that room. You can go, look. -Nidhi! -[crying] -I am sorry. -Hey, why are you apologizing? Stop. What actually happened? Are you alright? -Sir, the doctor wants to see you. -Okay. -I will just come. -Yes. -You are Mr.? -Dev, Nidhi's husband. Ah Dev! Nidhi is such a lovely girl. I am so sorry for your loss. That's okay. I looked into Nidhi's blood samples. Any problem ma'am? Nothing much. HCG levels are elevated. Normally, if it's high, there must be presence of other cells like malignancy. Is there anything serious? Oh no, nothing like that... That doesn't mean it's not to be looked into. I can see a small complication. I am going to write a few test. Get these done, so that I will feel comfortable. Once the reports are back, I can tell you more on Nidhi's condition. Doctor, what's wrong with me? -You... Can I be informal with you? -Yes. The reason for your miscarriage is cancer. Doctor, how can she have cancer? No chance! There might be a mistake with the reports. Can we review the test again? Nidhi? No way! Look how healthy she looks. We call it ovarian cancer. Now you are in stage three. There is 90% chance to cure it. We know how to treat it. At the age you are in, this is a bitter pill to digest... But with the right treatment, this can be cured. That's my belief. Trust me. You will be completely normal, after chemotherapy and radiation. Can we start the treatment today? Dev, can I speak to Nidhi privately? [voice muted] "How will we be one?" "How will we get separated?" "Is the reality becoming a dream?" "Or the dreams are becoming reality?" "Whatever is happening... However it is happening" "Is no one there to stop this?" "My breath is leaning over..." "Like a thunder." "Once upon a time, like an unending story." "This story will be told forever." "Once upon a time, like an unending story." "This story will be told forever." "My smile will remain yours forever." "My dreams are yours forever." "The destiny will also lose in front of us." "I will never leave you." Nidhi! Nidhi! Nidhi, what happened? Doctors already informed us. There will be some hair fall due to radiation. How can you demotivate because of it? I love my hair. Why is this happening to me? -Will I be cured? Or will I die-- -Shut up. -Have I ever scolded you? -No. I will slap you, if you say that ever again. But I won't look good without hair. Nidhi, you look good anyway. "At loss of what we wished..." "Even the universe is mourning." "The unexpected has happened..." "Like a tune without melody." "Even though a winner, it feels like they lost..." "In their life journey" "Eyes can't stop brimming..." "Love is knocking." "Once upon a time, like an unending story." "This story will be told forever." "Once upon a time, like an unending story." "This story will be told forever." -[Nidhi vomits] -Nidhi? [voice muted] The cancer cells have spread to other organs. Her body is not responding to the treatment. Till now we have been giving her pain killers. Let's hope for the best. Did you tell her? Geetha and Prashant got married, Nidhi. Do you know what the doctors told me? She is all fine. In another 10 days, she will get up and start running marathons. Hey, this time let's plan a trip. I will pay for the whole thing. Geetha you tell him, or he will try to ditch again. Doctor was shocked, she hasn't seen anyone in her service, who has recovered so soon. She asked me 'how come your wife is so strong'. Do you know what did I tell her then? That I cook for you. Hey, you leave, I will call you later. It's alright. -You leave for now. -No, we don't mind staying. -It's okay. -Leave for now. Geetha, I will call you. Bye, leave now. Bye. Dev! Are you okay? Can you take me home? Nidhi! Yes. I am still here. I haven't left yet. I am sorry, Dev. Why are you sorry, dear? Our kids, and then their kids... And we will grow old together seeing them. I promised you, that life. I am leaving you in the middle of the journey. Why do we have to talk about all this now? -Will you promise me something? -Yes. Don't be like this, I like this smile a lot. It should always be on you the same. I will be with that smile. I Promise. You said you wanted to meet Nidhi. Here she is. Hi Nidhi, how are you? Sorry, I got held up because of her. Isn't she exactly like you? You both have a certain resemblance too. Her name is Divya. She is a chatterbox, just like you. Divya, say hi. She can't see you waving. Tell it out loud. Hi! She really likes you. Come here. If you met Nidhi, you said you will hold her and hug her. Well, here she is. How are you still able to smile? It comes with love. She taught me that. If only we love, we endure pain. But when we are loved, we know what true happiness and life is about. When I get sad I remember that the one who taught me to smile... She doesn't like me being depressed. I feel like crying because she isn't with me... But when isn't she with me? So, I always smile. Actually, she really likes my smile. Being in love means doing what makes our loved ones happy. Frankly, it's like I am buried there. The one with you is Nidhi. Nidhi, I will drop Divya and be back. Okay? Because my nature is like Nidhi... ... you saved me. Gave me lift and told me your story, isn't it? Will you ever fall in love again in your life? Divya! Every time I fell in love, I thought that was my true love... After every breakup, I fell in love again. But when Nidhi entered my life, I came to know, what is true love. Even after losing her, her love is alive in me. That's true love. Don't know if I am being myself or not. I am now completely filled with her memories. Isn't that enough? Dev, this is my best journey, in my life. Your friends were right about you. With you, we can lose track of time. Bye!
