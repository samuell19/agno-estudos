- Oh My God! - You're getting it everywhere! - Okay! - Party! I went to school for this. Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! That one is yours. No, no, no! She's fine! - Hey, it's party time. - Pushy! Hey, cheers! Here is to the end of a horrible deep, dark shithole! What the hell is that? Now, more boob! You pervert! Hey, could I have some of that? So we're doing this? Becca, no. No acid. Hey, give me that. - Bossy. - No acid. Not tonight. Katie isn't going to go for it. This is our last night to be young and stupid. So go bang a girl. What do you think I'm trying to do? And drug dealers deliver. Hey, what's up? How's it going? - Good to see you. - Good to see you. - All right. - Ladies, I've got some goodies. Tyler, hey. Let's do it! Hey-oh! - I'm ready. - It tastes funny. You're not supposed to taste it. Okay, I'm ready! You try it. Grab yours. Blah, blah, blah, blah. Fine. I'll do it. But we have to get rid of the veiny sausage-fest over here. This is a girlfriend thing. Yeah, because I love hanging out with rude bitches. Did I say something to make you think I care? Don't be rude, Heather. Sit down. There. Are you sure you want to try this? I don't know. You don't have to do it, Katie. She's ready. She wants to. No, I want to. She wants to. There you go. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Woohoo! Pizza's here! Pizza delivery. Happy trippin'! Okay, she's locked it. Katie. Katie! Katie! Somebody help us! God, don't do that. Nice nap? Where are we? About five miles outside of crazy town. Population one. I'm fine. You were dreaming about The Bachelor, right? Did you get the rose? You know I hate that show. Oh, come on. You don't have that dream? Weird. No, what's weird is you kidnapping me for the weekend. That's what's weird. Oh, yes, I totally kidnapped you. Well, guilt tripping me is just as bad. I haven't seen you in months. No one has. I'm busy, Mel. Nobody is that busy, JoJo. I've had tons of auditions and appearances to do and I still make time for my friends. Are you going to tell me where we're going? Nope! Subtitles by explosiveskull Hey! Joey's here! Katie kat! Oh no. Oh yes. Kangaroo! No, Mel. Not today. It's hard enough. Joey, it's been five years. Yeah, you don't think I know that? You never talk about it. I mean, we all went through that night together and it's... - Hi. - Hey. We went through that night together and it's like you're trying to recover on your own. We are all moving on and I can't let you get left behind. Okay, okay, I understand that, all right? But I don't want to be around everyone right now. Take me home, please. No. No? What do you mean no? Oh, you don't know what no means? Oh, no wonder you were so popular! Oh come on, that was funny. All right, look, I have this all planned out and I'm not going to let you ruin it... So just look at this as being a minor intervention. We need you to come back to the world! Joey, come back. We'll show you the way, baby! We have ice cream! We have minty, minty ice cream! I mean, look how beautiful it is out here. We can go swimming in the river out back, or we can go hiking. Or we can sleep all day if you want. My mom said we can stay as long as we want. Oh my God! She did? Did she say we could stay up late too? Oh my God! Til like eleven! Come on. I came all the way up here. And I got it all ready and everything. Come on. Come on! All right. Thank you. Oh, and I brought pop tarts! - I said all right. - Ooh, and hard lemonade. - I'm gone. - I'm kidding. This is so unfair. You know that, right? Joey, you need this. You might not know it now, but you need this. You hear me? What I need is a glass of wine. Woo! Where's the wine, you assholes? This way, my darling! This way! How many serial killers are in this place? One. Sangria! No service. Fucking hell. How am I supposed to post pics? Maybe there's a bulletin board in town. We can post your pics there where no one will like them either. Well the first pic I'm going to take is that shitty ass macro-biotic cow puke you drink. What is this? It keeps me calm. You should be supportive, H-Bomb. Ooh! I forgot we used to call you that. Well we used to call you Harry Hara. - Oh my God! - Shut up! How many dudes has that giant bush scared off? I don't have time for dudes because my giant bush and I are just fine. - Here, let me help. - No, no, no. Go. Relax. Scoot. Now. So, can you chop a little faster there, love? - Getting thirsty. - I most certainly can. Melissa, you look stunning in these. Oh my God, I love the one with the glasses. Are you pregnant? All right, you're not getting any of my Sangria. Sorry, I broke it. It was a show. I was pregnant for fake. For fake. It was not realism. They pulled you into this too, huh? Yeah. Mel and her plans. Yeah. Yeah. So is this the point where we ask each other how we're doing and we both lie and say we're fine? Yeah, I think so. - Hi, Katie. - Hi, Joey. - Come here. - I missed you. Woo! Okay everybody come over here, come come come, I have drinks. - All right! - Woo, Sangria! - Sangria! - Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme!! - Thank you all for coming! - Of course! Thank you for having us! - Okay, let's have a toast! - Yes, a toast! To not killing anyone this time! Okay. - Okay, maybe a little too soon? - Little too soon. To the six bad ass bitches. Also good. - How about to six friends? - To six friends. To six friends. - Woo! - Eye contact, gonna have sex. Like the day of the dead. Who was the first person in the room? What did you see? Do I need a lawyer or something? - Am I in trouble? - I don't want to go to jail! Just walk me through everything that happened in there. Oh you guys shut up. It's my favorite show. It's not real. You know that, right? It's reality TV. They have writers. How does that work? Writers! - Reality! - Okay, I'm not listening. It's real people, acting real stupid. - Perfect for Mel. - Oh, come on! They get to be real celebrities. They get to be on TV. Some on magazines. Some even get to do movies. I mean, people care about them. How cool is that? I want to do that one, you know, with the obstacle course. Where they get hit and fall in the water? Yeah. That would be so fun. You know, those big balls knocking you over. You want to get paid to get knocked over by big balls? Sure. So does it have to be big balls or could it be, like, a group of smaller balls? I don't know. Whatever. How much would you charge to get hit in the face with these big balls? Like, per ball? I don't know. Oh my God! You're gross! Ow! Don't laugh. I mean, do you know how much those stolen sex tapes make? God, Stolen? They're not stolen. How do you know? Honey, because you can't sell a sex tape without the signed consent of the people in them. It's a business! They say these tapes are stolen but it's just advertising. Whatever, okay? That's a small price to pay for all of that. - No way! - Oh, she did not. No way. You guys are telling me you wouldn't get paid 2.1 million dollars to do a porno? No. I'd bend over and take a horse for that. Totally. You see, Joey agrees with me. Yeah, but if I'm being timed, I might need to train a bit. See, I'm not the only crazy one. Okay, ladies, off you go. Go get drunk! Joey and I have this. My God, Mel totally believes you. Yeah, well, you guys were ganging up on her. You know I've basically been like the father she never had since she was five. God, she loves that stuff. You know, she's gone on a few of those shows... Interviews, talk shows, that sort of thing. And some nightclubs even paid her to just go and hang out. I mean I got asked a couple of times but... You know. After... Yeah. I had agents and managers calling me. - Really? - Mm-hmm. The wanted to get the “Rapist Killer Six” on. My God. I don't even know what the point was. I don't even think that they knew. Of course not. The last thing I want to do is to hear about what happened over and over again. I hear ya, mate. Now go get drunk. Oh, touched your boob. Hey, don't drink my sangria. Ten bucks says that's a cat video. Thank you. Where's Katie? She's on the porch. Oh, you guys, here it is. Here it is. All right, you ready? This experience changed you. Whether it happened that night... - Boom, there it is! - Or since that night... - Angry tear. - Do you have any regrets? Huh? What? Come on, you guys. Angry tears. People love this shit. It's like, was she sad? Was she mad? No, she is mad. You know? Many are saying that you are merely the face of a new generation of women. But do you see yourself as a hero? I think that I'm a hero in a way that I can inspire other women to stand up for themselves. We're watching this? - I voted for cat videos. - It's not funny! Mel, you promised me. You said this goddamn weekend we wouldn't talk about it! Joey, we're not talking about it. This is my reel. My PR agent put it together, okay? - Your PR agent? - Yes. What the fuck is wrong with you? Oh my God, angry tears, Joey! Do you know how difficult that is to do? - It's like a contrast or, uh... - Juxtaposition. Yes. Yes. It's not something that just anyone can do. It's a natural ability. It's a gift. - Says who? - My acting teacher. Okay. Mel, you promised me. Joey! I said I didn't want to come but you said this weekend wouldn't be about it. - Joe. - No! Joey, listen to me. You can't keep doing this. We don't see you. We never hear from you. It's like... You were the one that died that night. I don't need this. Do you think any of us like living with this? With this looming over our heads? We never asked for this. Yeah, well, you're sitting around watching videos about it like it's a... like it's a fucking old volleyball tournament. - What? - Okay, number one, that is a terrible analogy, Joey, and number two... No! No fucking two, Heather! I'm out of here. I didn't want to spend my time with you guys talking about it. It? It? You can't even say what it... You can't even say what it is. Do you think you can heal like that? Hiding from it? Acting like everything is fine? Well, maybe I should drink a thousand fucking smoothies and smoke some weed. Will that make me feel better? Nice. Yeah, well, I'm sorry. This shit brings out the worst in me. We know. That's why we're all here. I can't eat. I can't sleep. So how do I get over that? Do we sit around eating cookie dough doing each other's hair while we watch a Gilmore Girls marathon and reminisce about the time we heard a grown man cry like a little boy as the life slipped out of him? Tell me! - I don't know, okay! - Yeah, you don't know! No, I don't know, but we have to... We have to do this together. Why? Because... God, women don't stick together. What? In this country, women make up 55% of the population but maybe two per cent of the government. We could take over the world if we wanted to but we don't, because we don't stick together. We are our own worst enemies. Men aren't holding us back. They don't have to because women turn on each other. They cut each other down, and it doesn't have to be that way. It doesn't. We could do anything. Even this, if we just fucking support each other. If we just stick together. Bitch! Oh my God! What? It was funny. I don't need this. - Joey, come on! - Joe... Joey, where are you going? Home. I don't want any part of this bullshit. You don't have a car. All right. I'll call a cab. - Where's your phone? - You can't go. Why not? Because... I see him. What? What did you say? I've seen him. Tyler. You see him? Okay, that's not funny. Look, I'm not making this up. Please. Please, believe me. I have been to doctors. I have talked to professionals. I have talked to everyone. That's why I go on these shows. I want someone to help me. I think that talking about it will help me. But I still see him and nobody cares anymore. If you're messing with me... I am going to be mad. I'm not. I'm not. I see him. Late at night I look out my window and there he is. And he's just standing there, in that mask. I mean... I turn on a flashlight, I call for help and then he's gone. I've seen him, too. Are you guys fucking with me? You are. Did you tell them? - You told them. - No, I didn't. Okay, if this is a joke, I am going to beat your asses. She's seen him too. We both have. Always just out on the street. Late at night. It's hard to see him but he's out there. With that mask. Guys, listen. We had a trauma, okay? A significant one. Stop trying to rationalize this! Fine. Mel, you're not crazy. Because I've seen him, too. But it's to be expected. Expected? That we've all seen the same thing? A fucking dead rapist! That's expected for you? Well, no, but I'm just saying, we had a traumatic experience and there's bound to be some sort of emotional echo. I guess I should feel better knowing everyone else has seen him? Not everybody. Joe? If you have, we should know. I mean, I guess if it was just a few of us it could just be our own issues. Minds playing tricks but if it was all of us... All six. You have to tell us. Joey. Tell me you haven't seen him. Tell me right now and I will let it go. Because I think you have. Joey! Have you seen Tyler? Joe! No. My God, you're lying. This was a mistake. I'm going to bed. You can take me home in the morning. Happiness. Sadness. Anger. Fear. Betrayal. Anxious. Happiness. I am in control. I am in control. Okay. Sadness. You look stupid. What do you want? I just, I need a tissue. I'm all sweaty. Okay. Eww, but here. What was that? Just Heather. She's acting stupid. Good night! Good night! Good night! Good night! Good night! Good night! Good night! Sahara! Yes? That good night sounded really forced. Like you didn't really mean it. No, I really meant it. Well, I don't want a good night that's forced. It totally defeats the purpose. Honey, I really, really, really meant it! Melissa! You're the actress now. Did Sahara really mean it? Hello? Melissa! Well, I prefer the term thespian. Okay then, in your lesbian opinion... Thespian! Okay, in your expertise, did Sahara's good night sound like she really meant it? I don't know. I think that she needs a stronger moment before like maybe some improv or... Hey, Sahara! Did you hear that? Melissa says you need some improv! Yes! I heard her. Oh my God, this is not helping me fall asleep! Oh my God! Good night, bitches! Why are you always calling women bitches? Yeah? I was going to say the same thing! I don't know. Because it's funny! It's demeaning! - To who? - To bitchy people. I would never call you guys bitches if you were actually bitches. Like I can't call Sahara "Cankles"? - What? - Exactly. You bitch! Hey, now you're using that term in a demeaning way! Yeah, I know! Well, I am totally offended! So if you don't mean it, then you can say it. You can say it with love and affection, yes. Bitches. Okay, so like, I can call Joey "Little Miss Sunshine?" Exactly. Or, "Happy Pants"? - What about "Giggles"? - All of those are good! I hear you bitches! Hey! Don't say bitches! It's demeaning! Only to bitches! Sleep! Oh my God! Go to bed! Okay! Okay, okay. Sahara! Good night! Good night! See, that one I really believed. Dumb. Aww... Good night. Good night. Katie. Katie, come on. Katie! Stop it. It's not funny. Katie. Really, it's not funny at all. I already feel sick. Honey, what? I just heard something. Heard what? Somebody telling me to run. Honey, no. You were just dreaming. Okay? It's fine. It's okay. What was that? I don't know. See, I told you. I told you someone was doing this. Doing what? I don't know. It's not funny. What's going on? Are you okay? Yeah. I jumped up too fast. The room is spinning a bit. Hey guys, where is everyone? - Katie is in your room, right? - Yeah. Did Mel go look? I don't know. I think so. I was sleeping. Okay. Mel! Mel! - Why are you whispering? - Because! If there is a bad guy here, I don't think we're sneaking up on him. Okay, well I'm open to suggestions. Hey, motherfucker! There are six of us and one of you, and... Yeah, maybe the big bad man might take one of us down but I shit you not that at least one of us is going to rip a few new holes inside of you! Nice. Bitch! Hey. God! It's fine? Yeah, it was just the screen door. I mean the door was bolted but the wind caught the screen and slammed it. Okay. That's a big ass door. Hey, are you okay, honey? I thought I was freaking out. What do you mean, freaking out? It's fine. Okay. I'm going to make some tea. Do you want some? No thanks. I'm going back to bed. All right. - Good night. - Good night. What's wrong? I don't know. He's got Katie in there. - I think she's passed out. - On acid? I don't know. Maybe he roofied her. I knew that guy was a dick! Katie! Oh God. We need help. We need help! I can't open it! - Yeah. - You guys hurry. We have to get Katie. She's locked up in the bedroom! Tyler has her. Come on! She likes it. Come on. I did this last week. Shit. Joey! Hey. Are you okay? Yeah. Good, because we need you here, honey. Shit, where's Mel? Mel! Mel? Mel? Where are you? Oh my God. - Mel. - Mel? - Mel. - Mel. Mel? Mel, listen to me, okay. Mel. We all saw him. All right? We're not crazy, okay? Someone is just messing with us. Mel, I need you to give me the knife, okay? - Come on. - It's okay, Mel. - She's gonna hurt herself. - Just let it go, honey. - Come on, Mel. - It's okay. Come on. - It's okay, darling. - It's okay, darling. Okay. - Honey... - Joey... I saw him! - Mel? - I saw him. Okay, um... your neighbors. Do you know them? Are there any assholes? Anyone that knows about us, about what happened? You think it was neighbors? I don't know. So I'm asking. Mel, think honey, okay. Did you tell anyone that we'd be here this weekend? Anyone at all? Anyone who might want to mess with us? - Darling? - No! Okay, and what about your neighbors? Do you know them? We don't have any neighbors for thirty miles. Okay, but what about the house next door, honey? It's empty. Katie! I'm out of here. Look, I don't know if you guys are fucking with me but it's not funny and I'm not staying here. Leaving? Joey was right. This was a mistake. I mean, what was I thinking coming out here to Camp Rape-my-face? Ha! Whatever. Katie, look, you can't go out there. - Why? - Because! Because no one would stay in a dark cabin in the woods with a psycho in a mask lurking outside? I'd rather take my chances in L.A. where there's people with guns. Lots and lots of guns. Honey... Katie! Wait. Honey... Sorry, Mel. Fuck your cabin. No bad guys. And Tyler... fuck you and your little baby dick, you motherfucking coward! See you later. - Wow. - Yeah. Just... Wow. Good for her. I'm going to get my keys. I call shotgun. Mel, come on. Get your stuff. We're out of here. I'm not gonna die in the woods like some hillbilly. I hope you can run seventy miles per hour, dickface. What the hell? Oh no, no, no. I filled you up. No, no, no, no, no, no, no! Fuck! Shit. Shit. I'm out of here in two minutes, ladies! I hope you're all with me! Shit! Katie left her phone and her wallet! And her necklace too apparently. Hurry up! We need to catch up with her. - Okay. - Move your ass! Please tell me they're leaving. Please. They wouldn't stay there. They wouldn't stay there in that house. Together. In a group. Oh shit. Shit. They're not coming. Okay, okay, okay. Oh God! Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit! Help me! Help me! Seriously, you're cleaning? No need to be rude. All right. Wait a minute, screw this. Mel! I'll send your mom flowers. Let's go! Mel! Let's go! - He's here! - Katie! Katie! You guys, help! Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God! It's okay. It's okay, honey! She's dead. - She's dead. - Why did she come back? Why was she out there? We saw her drive off! What was she doing? - I don't know. - Katie? Mel, Sweetie, I need you to wake up, okay? I need you to stay with us, all right? I'm not getting anything. Mel, where's the landline? Mel... It's not working. Mel, look, I need you to look at me, okay? I need you to stick around! We need you for this! Just stop, okay. She needs to snap out of it! Why, so she can freak out like the rest of us?! She's in shock, okay? We need to get her to the hospital. Give her a minute! Joe? What about you? Are you okay? Can you hear me? I can hear you. Are you okay? No. We need to figure out what we're going to do. We're going to kill him. Him? Yes, Sahara, it's him. You're just going to assume it's him? Yeah. That doesn't make sense, honey! Okay, I'm going to assume that it's him. I'm going to assume that some stranger didn't just come in here and shish-kebab our friend, okay? Okay. I'm going to assume that it's the same guy that we stabbed over a hundred times, okay? I'm going to assume that it's the guy that I personally took a knife and jammed it up his dickhole. Is it okay with you if I make that assumption? But how can it be him? How is that possible? It doesn't matter. I don't care if he lived, if he came back or if it's his twin or a copycat. Or a sad little man next door looking for attention. I don't even care if it's a demon coming back as him. He killed Katie. And now I am killing him. Again? Well, that's great, and I feel all empowered. I feel really super woman's libby! But I would prefer that we carry on this conversation in a place that has more than some... some ugly-ass family photos to use as weapons! Good idea. - Okay. - Let's go. No! No! You saw what he did to Katie! - Look at her! - Mel, calm down. No! Why did she come back? Why did she come back! - Shh. Shh. Shh. - He's out there! - He'll get us! - We need to stay calm. We need to stay together, Mel. Katie... Well, what about Katie? We can't just leave her here like this. We'll come back with the police. Mel, you can either walk out or get carried out. - It's your call. - Oh God. It's clear. Are you sure? Yeah. Okay. Good enough for me. Guys, come on. Let's go. Sahara, stay with Mel. Heather comes with me. Joe... You keep being you. One, two, three. - Let's take my car. - No. - It's more expensive. - Seriously? - It's closer. - Okay, fine. Do you smell that? - What? - Gasoline. - What? - Fuck! Keys! What? - What? - The fucker drained us. No gas! That's why Katie came back. She had no fucking gas. What?! Oh, no. Shit. Something's wrong. Mel? Do you see him too? Yes, I do. - Sahara! - Where? Where? Sahara, where is he? I don't see him! I saw him. I saw him. Where is he? He's coming. He's coming! In the house! We have to stay inside, we can't... Oh God, shut up! I'll apologize later. But seriously, right now, Mel, shut up. Okay. You saw him? - I didn't see him. - I did. It was him? I don't know whether it was. It was moving so fast. My God it was coming for me. I didn't see him. Oh no. Oh God. First we kill Tyler, then the cell phone guy. I swear... We can't stay. Oh really? The back door, it was open. It was locked when we left. He got in? He was out front! I don't know, every time I blinked he was there. He... He moved so fast. Mel, you saw him too, right? - I didn't see him. - He was there. That wasn't Tyler. That was something else. Look, I don't want to hear it, all right? Why? Because you know what we've done? We're being punished for what we did. - Stop. - No. We deserve this for what we did. For what we did? What do you mean? To him! I mean we could have just cut him, hurt him, scared him off maybe. You can't start second-guessing, okay? It was a bad night. We were tripping. Oh God. I know what I did. You guys can fight this if you want. There's a rifle upstairs. But I'm not helping. I know what I did. I know that I deserve this. I'm going upstairs to wait for it. No, no. We stay together. He could be out there. No, I'm done. She's lost it. Mel, where's the gun? Upstairs in my room. Let's go. Let's blow this fucker's nuts off. We've got to get out of here. Okay. Then what? We can... We can go break into the neighbors and then use their phone to call the cops. Good plan. I'm going to get some water first. - I'm friggin' thirsty. - Okay. We go together, okay? Nothing stupid. No one goes alone. We can't take Mel. Maybe we can? We'd have to carry her. We cannot leave her. - I'll stay. - No. I feel really nauseous. I suddenly feel sick. I feel really dizzy. I'll be fine. Okay. Here, you take the knife. - Okay. - All right? Now I want you to watch from Sahara's room and let us know if you see him, okay? Okay. - Okay. I promise. - Okay. Mel, sweetheart. I'll be right down the hall okay. Just... Just yell. Okay? I'll be right there. Oh God. I just feel so dizzy. Mel? Mel, did you hear Heather? She's going to be right down the hall. And we'll be right back. Okay? Lock the door behind us. Lock the door behind us. Okay? - Ready? - Okay. Careful, careful. Shh, shh. Mel, lock the door. I've got mine. What? What's that going to do? It's metal. Fine. - It's iron! - Okay, fine! It's heavy. Feel it. Let's go. Now you got me all worked up. Good! Flip your bitch switch and let's go! Now we can say bitch and it's okay? Yeah. Okay. - God! - Sahara, are you okay? Yes. I saw you rubbing your hands. - So? - Are they numb or something? Can we talk about this later? Hasn't that happened before? Shut up! Shh! Oh my God. What? What is it? He's there. He's there. Bec! Bec! Bec! What's wrong? Are you okay? Shit. We've been drugged. Bec, get over here! Becca, help me! Get over here! Bec! Sahara, try to undo the knot! Try to undo the knot! Listen. Bec? Becca, listen to me. Go get Heather and go get the knife. Go get the knife from Heather! Wait, Bec! Bec, give me the gun! I got you! I got you! I'm not going to let you go! I'm not going to let you go! Hang on. I got you! Okay? Hang on. Fuck! Mel? Mel, we got to go. Something is really wrong. Mel, get up! I'm so tired. Mel... Mel, get up. We gotta go! Come on, get up! Come on, sweetie! I can't leave you here! What is wrong with you? Sleeping pills. I will never forgive you for this as long as I live! - Oh! - What the shit! - Where are they? - I almost just killed you! I don't think so! Sahara's hurt. I need the knife. What? I left it upstairs! Go get the knife! Oh! Where's the fucking knife? Oh, shit, Oh my God. I'm so stupid. Oh, fuck. Mel... Oh... Jesus. Jesus fucking Christ, don't let her scream. Don't wake up. Where's a fucking hammer? God dammit. Oh, no. Oh, stop moving, Sahara. Sahara, stop moving if you can please! Quit moving, Sahara, it's hard for me to hold you up! Ah! Oh, shit. Oh, shit! Quit moving, Sahara! Stay still! Fuck you. Oh God! Oh God! Sahara! Grab the rope with both hands. Grab the rope with both hands and hold tight! Both hands! Here we go. Ready? Oh God. Oh God. Heather, he doesn't know you're here. He doesn't know you're here. Just sit still and be quiet. We need to get this off us! The gas! Shh! Come on. Come on. The river, the river. The river. Mel said it's out back. Come on! Help me up! Wait! Wait! Which way? Which way is it? Oh God, which way? Fuck it. Jo! He's coming! Joey, he's coming! He's going to burn us alive. Run, Joey! Run! Oh my God! Oh my God! Jump! - Help! - Help! Oh, God! Ow! My ankle! Where the fuck is the water? I think I broke my leg. Joey! Joey, help me! Help me! Help me! Bec! Bec! Bec, wait! Bec! Where are you going? Bec! Round two, bitch! Let's try this again, bitch! Heather! Heather, get Mel! We've gotta get out of here! Oh my God! Oh, Heather! Come on. Grab onto me! Come on, I got ya. Mel, wake up! Mel... Mel! She always ruins everything. Everything! I mean my reveal was supposed to be so good! Melissa... Jo, I'm pissed. I mean, I had this all planned out. I was going to be like, "Oh, we did it!" and you were going to be like "Oh my God!" And we were going to have this whole best friend bonding shit! Melissa... You know what, I'm over it. It's fine. I guess I'm just pissed because I wanted to do the whole trio thing. You really need three. You've got to have two hot ones, and an ugly one. She was going to be our snaggle-tooth. I don't understand. Okay, like, you're the hot and brooding one, I'm the hot and fun one and she was going to be the gross one that made us look better. She's not gross. Well, she is now. I mean don't get me wrong, she was going to go anyway but I was thinking more of a Season One cliffhanger. But this... This is really kind of a waste. You did all this. You did all of this... to us. You... You drugged the drinks so that we would see Tyler and freak out. Wow. Amazing, Joey. Now, okay, I know you totally have a ton of questions. No. No questions? None? Weird. Because it doesn't matter. That's right. It doesn't matter. It's all about the destination, not the journey. It doesn't matter what you have to do to get there. Joey... I knew that you were just like me. I knew that when we were talking about reality TV and the sex tapes and you said that you'd do a porn for money... I knew right then and there I had made the right choice. I knew that you understand how this industry works and that you were thinking the same way I was. No. Never. You said that you would do a porn for money. Would do anything, like even a horse or something. I was kidding, Mel. Why would you do that? That is fucked up. This? Don't worry, Joey. This is totally a Heather thing. I'm not going to use this on you. Katie got knives in the back. Sahara got torched. Becca... Becca was a little different. That bitch hit me on the head with a whiskey bottle but, you know what? I improvised. Improv classes always teach you "yes and" so I went with it. Yes, I really did think of everything. I always think of everything. Okay, that I didn't think of. Shit, that was hot. You know what? We should do that again for the camera. Hold on. I have my phone here. I'm leaving and I'm calling the cops. I really don't want to kill you, Mel. I know you don't, Joey. I really did think of everything, didn't I, Joey? If you started being all whiny, sad Jo I thought, "Oh that's perfect. She just OD's on painkillers." I mean, it makes perfect sense. After that night you just couldn't get past it. You just couldn't move on. So you turned to drugs to numb the pain. Mmmmmm. That makes for such a good story. Easy to believe with how you withdrew from us... And how you stayed out of the lime light. God, that's such a good story, how you had something to hide. And then you just snapped. Oh my God! Katie! Somebody help us! Get off her! Oh my God! Yes, I'll be here. Oh, please, help me! Please, you've got to help me. She's lost her mind. She killed everyone. Yes, I'll be here! Oh, thank you! Thank you. Oh God, it's horrible. My friends, everyone's gone! I'm making this tape just in case I don't survive so that everyone can know what really happened. And everyone can know me. The real me. Joey... she killed everyone! She thought she killed me. She's never been the same since the night we fought off the rapist. How many people does this have to happen to? What is it about me that makes this just so... so... Fuck. She's never been the same since the night we fought off the rapist. How many people does this have to happen to? What is it about me that makes it so... Oh... You didn't use enough. Joey. That shit you injected me with... You get a tolerance to it. Wait a second. You're an addict? That's perfect, because I just made that up for the show. Yeah, you stop seeing your friends, your family. But it takes the pain away. That's the important part. Joey, listen to me. This can be just like it was before. God, I wanted to forget so bad. And I tried. I tried, Mel. I tried three times. I tried three times to overdose. I didn't use enough. Neither did you. Joey, remember? Remember before? We had everybody wanting to interview us! Everyone wanted to talk to us! We had all this attention and that was just for one guy. Imagine what we would get for all of this. Oh my God, we would have our own show in seconds! Seconds flat, Joey! I changed my mind. I do want to kill you. Well, it's not loaded. No shit. God, really, Joey? Really? Do you really think you have a chance against me? Do you really think you can take me? I've killed five people already. Five! I don't give a fuck if I live, you psychotic cunt. No! You stupid bitch! You fucked up my eye! How dare you! You fucked up my eye! Now I'm never going to get a show! Listen to me! I want you to fucking know... Listen to me! What? What did you want to say? What, Mel? I really want to hear it. You were right. I needed this. You... You survived last year's awful tragedy... And now you've written a book: "The Sixth Friend". In it you mention that you even managed to learn something from that... that terrible tragedy. What Melissa did... Her desperation... her selfishness... I can never forgive. But it gave me something: A reason to live. I'm just happy that I have a chance to share my story of hope with others. Josephine Taylor, thank you. And be sure to watch her long road to recovery as she navigates the dating world in her new show starting Thursday nights at 8pm, this week. Subtitles by explosiveskull
