My name is Jorge Antonio Lopez. (Speaks Spanish) He needs Ritz crackers and water. I'm sorry, I don't have no Ritz. I got chicharonnes. What's that? It's a... it's a pig skin. Fried pig skin, buddy. Do you have a bag up there? Or else this is gonna top off in just a second. No, no. I'm sorry. No bags. Carly? Honey? Hi, I could use your help here. You have any bags? Thank you. JORGE: Are you here for business or pleasure? I don't know if pleasure is the right word. We just needed to get away for a while, that's all. Just a change of scenery. JORGE: Sounds like pleasure. See it is a magic place. But just like in your country, we have some very bad people. Who were those guys? Those were the very bad people. You be better to stay by the villa. (Song playing in Spanish) May I suggest la ensalada de Chicatana. Ohhh! Veronica makes delicious. What's that? It's a salad of flying hormigas, ants. Oh, it's wonderful. (♪♪♪) Hola. Hola, Veronica may I present la familia Candlewood. Bienvenidos. Hola. I am Veronica. - You Carly? - Ah, yes. Mucho gusto. Nice to meet you. You have a nice trip? Huh, fine. You remind me of someone. Do I? Very pretty face. You Mejicana? Not that I know of. I'm adopted. Of course not. Oh, this is my husband Andrew, our son Danny. Mom, what do I do with this? Tu hijo? I didn't know you bring boy. Sorry, I must have forgot to include that. You didn't tell her when you made the reservation? No, sorry, is that okay? No problema. Give me that, Danny, let's get you cleaned up. Okay. House is good choice, honey. What do you think? Um, it's... big. Sure is. Can't believe we're here for the whole month. We can live like kings... or drug lords. Okay. Well, I'm going to get the registration stuff figured out. Why don't you get unpacked? (♪♪♪) (♪♪♪) - You okay? - I'm fine. So, I was talking to Veronica and she recommended this really great place for us to grab dinner. I was thinking maybe we could go there. Just the two of us? We can leave Danny here with her. They seem to really be hitting it off. Sure, yeah. So, nice bed. Bouncy, pillowy. I'm a fan. Have you tried it? All right, Carly, look. We can talk about this. You know that's why we came here. Sure we didn't come for the ant salad. We came here to find some peace and quiet and talk this out, right? Most couples get... find it hard to continue after losing a child and... What's the name? Of the restaurant? What's the name? I'll look up reviews. I don't know. She didn't say. I doubt it's on Yelp, though. Can you just stop for one second? I can't believe that I'm the one who wants to start a conversation about our feelings. I'm unpacking. You told me to unpack. I'm unpacking. Then you can unpack later. Just please. I think about Bridget all the time. Stop. Stop it. I don't wanna do this. Can you just not say her name? Please. - She's my daughter too. - She was! Was your daughter, Andrew. Okay. I see this is it. This is exactly why most couples get... Get what? What were you gonna say, Andrew? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. Dad. Hey, buddy. Can we go explore outside? Veronica says there's all these neat water roads around here? Water roads? Oh, the canals. - Yeah. - Yeah, of course. Yeah, we can see the canals, buddy. Oh! Cool box. Don't touch that. Sorry, mom. Look, I just... I don't want you to play with it. Hey why don't we... why don't we go outside, come on. Mom, you coming? Yeah, of course, she's coming, buddy. ANDREW: The fresh air will do her good. Right, Dan? Right. God. (♪♪♪) It's beautiful here. Whoa, cool, mom, look, what I found. You know he is still alive, right? Andrew, please. You always said you couldn't connect with your mother and here you are doing the same thing with your son. He's here with us physically. He didn't die with Bridget. Can we just hold off on this for a few days? He thinks you're mad at him. It just... feels wrong to smile. It feels wrong to be happy, to be alive. Then we talk about it, all right. I'm here for you. Most husbands would have left, but here I am. What does that mean? You know what it means. It means I'm here. I'm staying. You need me, Carly, and for fricks sake I need you too. I lost Bridget also. Yeah, but you didn't know her like I did. You didn't hold her. Oh, I held her. I asked the doctor to let me. And she was real to me, she still is. ANDREW: You said you didn't feel close to your mother because you were adopted but here you are doing the exact same thing to your son. Don't push him away. (Whispering) Danny needs us. And we need each other. In a year or two from now, we can try again. I'm just... I'm so angry. I don't know what I did wrong. You didn't do anything wrong, honey. You didn't do anything. No, I messed up. I messed up so bad I let our little girl die. I don't wanna do that with Danny. (Whispering) (Scream) (Danny screams) DANNY: Help! God, Danny. DANNY: Mom. Dad. Come over here. - Hey! - Danny! DANNY: Mom, Dad. Please help me! Mom! (Danny screaming) Danny! He's caught on something. Something wrapped around his leg. - Rip at it. - I'm trying. (Carly screams) Just get him out! Get him out! Now, go! - It was just weeds. - No. - What? - There was somebody. - There was somebody down there. - Where? - Somebody grabbed my arm. - Oh, come on, honey, please. You know I hate to be the one to tell you this but the doctor made me a promise I'd do it, I'm telling you. Have you taken your meds today? God, Andrew. Did you see anyone down there in the water? I saw a lady. - What? - I saw a lady too. - In the water? - Okay. Have you taken your meds today, bud? What the heck is that? Oh, come on, let's go. (♪♪♪) (♪♪♪) Danny would love this place. Do you think he's upset that we left him behind? No, absolutely not. With all the chocolate Veronica's been feeding him? I'm really sorry about everything. Sweetheart, there's nothing you need to be sorry about. You have given me the most amazing wonderful thing anyone could ask for. What's that? Well, funny you should ask because I have that for you. Open it up. Right there is everything I want and everything I ever will want. You know I'm crazy about you. Well, I'm just crazy. Maybe that's part of the attraction. I'm gonna see if they have our song. Da, da-da da. Andrew, they don't have our song. ANDREW: They may. No, I don't even what you're singing. - Na, na-na na, na. - That's not a real song. They... it is a real song and if they have it, you're gonna dance with me. Promise, you're gonna dance with me. Promise, you're gonna dance with me. I love you. I love you. (Screams) (Speaks Spanish) I don't... don't speak Spanish. I'm sorry. Lucky day for you lady, because my English is super good. That you hijo? Son... this is my son, yes. He looks strong. He's going to be big strong guy, eh? Maybe you introduce him to me. My husband is coming right back. We were just here to have a quiet meal. Oye, am I bothering you, senora? I'm sorry con el excuse me. (Speaks Spanish) All right. They do not have that song but they're gonna play something really similar... Is everything okay? Si, senor. Your woman here trying to make love to me, and I tell her that's not very nice, she should only make love with husband... Okay, listen pal. We just want to eat our dinner in peace, so maybe you can scram. But senor, I offer my ayuda. If your woman needs another hombre to... Andrew? (Speaks Spanish) Your boy. He at your hotel? Make(Speaks Spanish) r. What the hell does that mean? I told you to stay by the villa. Mama Veronica said this place was excellent. JORGE: This place not safe. No. Dinner is over, okay, let's go back, okay? Are those guys cartel? It's not good to talk. Wait, CARTEL cartel? Yeah, people go missing. Touristas. Young kids. This is not a safe place. Stay by the villa. - Okay, let's go. - I'll drive. Here. Comfy cozy? Comfy cozy. I'm sorry to interrupt. No problemo. Come on in. Just wanted to say good night. Night, Mom. Sleep tight, baby. Dad, did I do something wrong? - Does mom... - No, no, no. You didn't do anything wrong. Mom is... she's going through a tough time right now, that's all. Losing your sister was... well, she needs some more time to heal that's all. But she loves you so much. You just never forget that, all right. I wanted a little sister, too. Yeah, you guys would have been major troublemakers together, - huh? - Probably. All right. Well, we are gonna finish exploring this place tomorrow. You know? Go to bed, right. (♪♪♪) (♪♪♪) ANDREW: Veronica. Who's that? The man who built this house. ANDREW: And those women? His family. (Whispers) Looking good. What I can't say that? Wanna fool around? I don't want to rush you into anything, but I miss you lady. I miss us. I miss us too. Oh, my God, it's been so long. I know I'm sorry. - I just... - I get it. I get it. We don't have to take a second baby off the table. What? Look, I'm trying to be understanding, Carly. Well, continue to do so please. Sweetheart it's been eight months since Bridget... I'm sorry, am I reaching the expiration date of mourning the loss of my baby? No, no, that's not what I meant. No, that's exactly what you meant. Why do we have to end up having a heated debate about everything? (Whispers) Oh, my God. ANDREW: What? It's Danny. ANDREW: What? (♪♪♪) Danny! Oh, God! Danny? Danny! Danny! (Whispers) Danny. Oh, God. No, Danny! Danny, no! Danny, no! Danny! Danny! Jesus, Carly, what are you doing? Danny! He was in the bathroom. No, no, I saw with someone. I saw him with a woman. Is mommy okay? Yeah, yeah. She's all right, bud. She's just going for a night swim, that's all. I'm gonna go get her alright, wait here for me. Carly, what the hell is the matter with you? I saw someone. Come on. Get out. I saw someone. Okay, right. Come on, let's go, come on. You don't believe me. - Andrew... - No, I believe... I saw a woman drag a little boy who looked just like Danny into the water. I believe that you saw her, honey. Wait, where did he go? What? - Where's Danny? - The woman is not there, though. - Where's Danny? - He's right there. - He was right here. - Danny? Danny? Danny? Son? Danny! - Danny! - Where did he go? Danny! Danny! He's gone. - No, no, no. This is nuts... - He's gone. He was right here, come on. Danny! What is happening? Danny! Son?

Oh, my God. They have to wait 24 hours before they can officially say somebody is missing. Twenty-four hours! Our son is missing. We know that now! They say they don't have enough hombres to start searching this late now. I don't fricking give two shits! Why don't we just... why are they going? Don't worry. They will look around. They'll go looking. No. They have to do more than that. I can't frickin believe this. What about the... the... the cartel guys from the restaurant? They said something about Danny. What did they say? The cartel sometimes takes children for... for... For what? For bad things, senora. For bad things. Oh, my God. Please we have to find him. Please, now.

Everyone in Mexico know story. We tell it to our ninos to keep them home, keep them safe. Pero is no lie, Llorona is real. (♪♪♪) VERONICA: Maria loved him very much. But Hernandez had a wife. VERONICA: She was sick. She could have no bebe, but Maria have one. Why do they call her Llorona? In English it's 'weeping woman' because she cries for her bebe, for herself. VERONICA: Everyone know story of Llorona. Maria no die that night, she lives forever. Cursed. Llorona's out there. Wanting here baby? Or any baby. She takes ninos all the time. Until she find her bebe. Wait what do you mean? It is not safe here. Llorona took my little Angela, I never see her again. No, I don't believe it. You don't believe in ghosts, senorita? That's not it. That thing out there, that's not a ghost. That's something else. Ghosts don't grab people. (Speaks Spanish) Sorry, I don't understand. She's more strong now. Something has happened. La Llorona never leaves the water. Never comes into the house. Never, never, never. My grandmother say that this will happen when she feels her bebe near. Well, Danny is not her bebe. Yeah, no shit he's not her baby. Look, we have to do something. Call the police. No, no, policia. Policia, no, no one. Policia won't help. Okay, so what do we then? Just sit here? Keep bebe safe. You got Danny back. He is safe here. Holy place. We wait. Wait for what? Fill me in here. Sunrise. Legend says that the La Llorona can only come out at night. Si si. My grandmother said that when sun come up, and if she have no Danny, she lose and go. But I've already seen her during the day. No, impossible. No, yes, it's possible. I saw a woman in white in the canals in broad daylight. How do we stop her? There's another way. There is an isla... No, no, Veronica. Wait wait what were you saying? An isla... island? Nothing, nothing. There's no island. We wait here. Here we are safe, it's a... it's a holy place. These crucifixes are the only way to stop her. Do you have a phone? Thank you. The consulate is closed. I'm not calling the consulate. I'm calling my husband again. He'll be fine. La Llorona likes little kids. She won't hurt him. Then where is he? I lost him. So, then he could be in trouble too? I'm more worried about us than him. Why do you have his phone? Let me explain senorita. No, I thought you said you didn't find him. - No, I... - Why do you have that? No... (Speaks Spanish) Why do you have his phone? Senora. No guns, senora. Talk! - I found it. - CARLY: Where? On the road, on the road. And there was no sign of my husband? No no. I was going to give you the phone but everything got so crazy, I forgot. When I pulled up, your husband was already gone. How do I know you're not cartel, too? I'm not cartel, senora. I'm not. How do I know you're not just pretending with all this La Llorona stuff, so you can make a ploy to kidnap my son? I saved Danny, I'm your friend. Maybe you just saved him so you could hand him over to them. VERONICA: No. I'm not cartel, senora. I'm not. I don't trust you. I want you out of here. Leave now. Mommy, mommy. What's happening? Danny, stay there. He can no open door. He's going to. Go! Senora, I am a good man. I don't care. I don't want you in here. Open it! No, please. Don't open, no. Go. Senora, if I die... You'll be fine. You're not a little kid, she won't go after you. That's what you said about my husband, right? So, go. If you really are a good man, then bring help. Bring somebody to get us out of here. If he open the puerta, open the holy place. What does that mean? Open it. He no safe without puerta. I thought you said the crucifixes will stop her. You're wearing a crucifix. It'll protect you. (Screams) What the hell is happening! I thought you said that thing only takes kids. She's more strong now. She know Jorge tried to stop her. So, she take him to protect hijo. He's a good man. But you make him leave. She take Angela, now Jorge. Danny, stay here. Don't let him leave. I'm going for help. Stay here. No, mommy, please no.

I lost her. I'm coming to get you. No, no, senora. (Speaks Spanish) Stay hidden. No, it's okay. I think she's... (Llorona screams) (Carly screaming) Please help mommy. You have to save her please. (♪♪♪) (Carly screaming) Maria! For Angela and Jorge! Mommy! Danny, no! Don't take my son. Mom! She took him, she got Danny. Senora, I'm so sorry. I told Danny stay. No, leave room. It's not your fault. She's too strong now. She got him, she won. It's over. No, no, no. You can save him. But, there's a price. What how? Trade her hija for Danny. Hija? Her daughter? Her bebe was a girl. Her name Gabriella. Gabriella live with her papa Hernandez after Maria die. My great grand mother raised her. Love her as her own bebe. Hernandez loved Gabriella very much. More than his wife. He gave her a music box for her birthday. His wife was so jealous she tried to curse Gabriella. My great grandmother was also great buja, great witch. Put a spell on music box to warn Gabriella. When danger was near, it plays song. (Song playing) (Screaming) VERONICA: Hernandez found her and buried her the same night. When Hernandez left to bury the body, mi abuelo guard over secret. She not tell even me. Veronica stay over here, I'll go for help. No, that's okay. I wanna see my Angela now. I miss her so much. I'm so sorry. No time. She knows her bebe is near, but can't see her. Now, I know... You... You must show her... You must show her... La Llorona. Isla... Isla? The island? What island? Isla de la Munecas. Gabriella... Veronica? Oh, God. Veronica. I'm going to get him back. I'm going to get him back. (♪♪♪) I'm coming, baby. Mommy's coming. Oh, my God, Andrew.

Hey, senora, you too. What are you gonna do with us? Did you know there are places on the internet where you can buy all kinds of meat? All kinds. (Speaks Spanish) Not this time, old man. Si, this time. No more ordering me around. (Conversation in Spanish) JORGE: I am sorry. Please forgive me. (Speaks Spanish) Forgive them please. I thought you were dead. No, not yet, baby, not yet. Andrew, you okay? Are you okay? I am fine. Where's Danny? We're gonna find him. Don't run out on us like that again. I won't I promise. You better not. What the hell happened to you? I thought I saw this lady with Danny. And I crashed the cab. And these assholes kidnapped me. You say kidnapped, but maybe we saved you gringo loco. Sorry about earlier when I made you leave. JORGE: No. We do things for our families sometimes. Even when they are no good. You know these guys? Yes, my son. Your son? (Speaks Spanish) (Speaks Spanish) La Llorona. What are they laughing about? What's a Llorona? That lady, that thing that has Danny. You know where Danny is. I might. Jorge, do you know a place called Isla de la Moneca? Munecas. That's it, yes. Do you know where that is? Veronica said that's where Danny might be. Isla de la Munecas is where Llorona takes all the children that she steals and gives all the dolls their souls. Oh, my God. Danny. We have to find him. We have to find him. (Whispers) - DANNY: Mommy? Mom! - Oh, my God. ANDREW: He's in the canals? Danny. (Speaks Spanish) La Llorona. (Llorona screaming) Follow the water. Go to the Isla de la Munecas. Go find your son. I'll stay here with mine. - CARLY: Let's go. - Come on. La Llorona is real? Si. (Llorona screaming) (Speaks Spanish) (♪♪♪) No!!! No, Pedro! No!!! JORGE: No!!! Did you hear that? She's got him. They're gone. CARLY: We must be getting close. (Whispers) Look at the light on the island. Is it dawn or blue hell? Look at this. Oh, my God. It's like Christmas decorations for the dead. CARLY: She's more real now. It's like she's risen from the dead. Something has made her more powerful. This is creepy as shit. You've got to fill me in here, Carly. What the hell is going on? We're looking for a grave. Whose grave? The grave of Maria's daughter. Whose Maria? Maria is the La Llorona. What! Can you please just trust me on this? Oh, my God. Do you think that's a grave? See if it says Gabriella. Just any Gabriella, or does she have a last name? I don't know. I think it's Hernandez. Hernandez. I don't see any markings like this is a grave. (Llorona's scream) Shit! What does this have got to do with Danny? It's complicated. Can you please just trust me? This is the only cross I see but it looks like it's more for protection for these frigging dolls than it is for a grave site. I don't know. I know whatever it is, it would be old, really old. Old. Everything's old. Wait, wait. Jorge said something. He said the dolls hold the souls of all the children she's taken. So, maybe she's in one of the dolls. Maybe the dolls mark the graves? I don't know. So, this is the island of death? God, Carly. Wait. Maybe it's here. Help me. What year did she die? Right after that photo was taken. So, was it like 1800s? 1800s. Something about that picture changed her. - What if this is it? - 1880. I think I found her. That's when her step mother killed her. Oh, my God. Here, start digging. We need the body. DANNY: Mommy! Danny. He's here, let's go find him. No, no. You stay here. Dig. I'll find him. Wait, wait! You're not going anywhere without me. We can't get him without the body. Please. How will I find you? Follow our voices and bring the body. Go go. I'll dig. Oh, my God. - DANNY: Mom! - Danny! Danny, I hear you. Danny? DANNY: Mommy! Mom! - Mom, where are you? - Danny. Danny? Oh, shit. Danny? DANNY: Mom. Danny? Danny! Danny! DANNY: Mom, please help. Danny. DANNY: Mom. Danny, I hear you. Danny, Mommy's coming. DANNY: Mom. Danny. DANNY: Mommy. Come here, baby. Mom. Are you okay? I wanna go home. We will. Daddy's here. Dad's here? Yeah, dad's here and... (Llorona's scream) She's coming. You cant have him, you understand. CARLY: Por favor, Maria. It's Mio. Danny is mio. Por favor. Por favor. Andrew. Andrew, drop the gun. Shit. I'm not going to drop it. CARLY: Just do it. Just trust me. Just put the body on the ground. Shit! Hija. Gabriella. Hija. Go to dad. Hey, buddy. Go to the boat. We're not leaving you here. Yes please go now. Please just go. I'll meet you there. Mom you can't stay. Shh... please. Hey mom's gonna meet us in the boat, okay, buddy? Go, go. Or at least I hope she will. Let's go. Come on. Run. (Llorona crying) Hey, listen to me. Listen, listen. Hey listen to me, if mum doesn't come out in one minute, I'm gonna go back in to get her. You have to wait in the boat. Tell me you're going to wait in the boat. I'm gonna wait in the boat. Okay, I love you, buddy. Yeah, Gabriella. (Llorona crying) Oh, shit. It's the wife. Gabriella killed her. God, that was the secret. Maria, I'm so sorry. I thought Hernandez buried Gabriella here, not his wife. Shit. (Llorona screaming) Get in the boat! Come on, buddy. Let's go. Now, go! (Llorona screaming) (♪♪♪) Come on, buddy, let's go. You think it worked? No, it wasn't her baby. She's still after us? I don't know. Oh, God. Andrew, save Danny. Whatever you do save him and not me. Promise me. Promise me. - Run! - No, honey. No. - (Llorona screaming) - Run! DANNY: Leave her alone. Please! I don't want to grow up without my mom. (Hernandez speaks Spanish) No! No, take me instead. (Llorona screaming) (Speaks Spanish) Thank you. Thank you to Christo and my taxi. Oh, sweetheart. Oh, my God. I think it's over. I love you so much. Let's promise to never leave each other no matter what happens, we're always stronger together. Yes. Let's get back to Los Angeles where things actually make sense. Amen. Thank you, Jorge. (♪♪♪) Hi, baby. Hey, you all packed? All packed. Was she cute? She was, just like her brother. Bye, Bridget. Bye, Bridget. Hey! This is our last chance for fun on this trip. You have your soccer ball handy? - Yes. - Yeah. CARLY: Why do they call her La Llorona? VERONICA: In English it means, 'weeping woman'. Because she cries for her bebe. For the baby she kept trying to find. You remind me of someone. You Mexican? CARLY: Huh, not that I know of. I'm adopted. (Gabriella speaks Spanish) She's looking for her family. You... nieta. You saved her. My grandmother Gabriella. (Whispers) (Llorona screams) (♪♪♪) (Groaning and crying) (♪♪♪) (♪♪♪) (♪♪♪) (♪♪♪) (♪♪♪) (♪♪♪)
