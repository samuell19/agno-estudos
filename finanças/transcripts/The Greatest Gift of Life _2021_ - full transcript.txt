The Awe-Inspiring Tale of a Father and Daughter "Sasai" Doesn't this say, "Cement drink on sale for 2,980 yen a box?" I'm asking what this is. "Sir, I understand. This is a special sale item." "Shinosuke Tatekawa" "So we decided to stack the boxes as high as we could." "And some boxes fell down." "The start of the sign is covered" "At the very beginning, it says, 'Enhan'" Ah, enhancement drink... I thought it was weird. If it were oyster extract drink or Korean ginseng drink... Then that'd seem somewhat healthy, but cement drink? Wouldn't that be bad for you to drink? Excuse me, sir. "We'll give you a box" No, no, no thanks. No one comes over, do they? "Even if we lock eyes, no one tries coming over" "They hem and haw" "Finally, you appear" "And just when I thought you'd come over, even you walk away" "I thought we were having an important conversation, but you're just an idiot." I'm the idiot? Forgive the intrusion. Alright. "My apologies, sir." "Our store doesn't carry a cure for idiocy." Right? Hm? What do you mean by, "Right?" Shut it. You're so dull. I meant a lot of things by that. Understand? I don't want to say something so artless as, "That was entertaining," after watching rakugo. It cheapens things. I didn't just laugh. I felt many deeper things than that. But the moment I call it entertaining, it seems like it just made me laugh. So I took the, "Right?" from, "Entertaining, right?" and all its various meanings. There are implicit connotations included in that. Understand? That's what we call an adult conversation. I see. How do you respond to, "Right?" I'd suppose, "Yeah," or "Right." There's a depth that you add when you abbreviate things. You call yourself an editor? That's why you'll always be like that. Like what? Ah, I should begin dinner prep soon, right? You'll come eat, right? What are you saying? I'm planning on making shiraae and grilled salmon. It's been soaking in wine since morning. It'll be good. I learned about it from cooking class yesterday. Hm? Wait a moment. Didn't you say yesterday that you had a fever and couldn't move? Sir? Isn't that what you said? I better get to it. That's not an answer... Sir! Sir! Shut it! "Shiraae" Would you like my help with anything? You know, only able people should offer their help. Just be quiet and watch. Yes. Alright. Forgive the intrusion. And hello to Mr. Nomura too. Hello. Mitsuyo, what do you want? Why are you asking that looking so grumpy? Can I not visit without a particular reason? Generally people don't without one. Well, your late wife said to me, "Please watch over and take care of my husband." So that's why I make sure to make my visits. You could watch over me from afar. No, I couldn't. I wouldn't be able to see you. I guess you're right. But what his wife thought, Was that Mr. Sasai by himself wouldn't be able to do the cooking or housework. She didn't imagine that he'd come to like those things. So I don't know if you're really that necessary. But she asked me to. So I'm doing it. Maybe you have too much free time? You say something? You couldn't even seal the deal with his daughter. Oh, you're gonna go there? Should we go? Aren't you the one angling to be his next wife? I'm not! I'm doing no such thing! Anyway, I have a husband. Like that changes things. What do you mean? I already come here for work. So do you need to be here? I would like for Mr. Sasai to be focused on his work. Every single day, for no reason at all... I have a busy life too, you know. But despite that, I come here out of duty. I told you... You know, Mr. Sasai looks young, but he's getting up there. You never know what could happen. That's why I need to come check on him everyday. What if he collapsed and died without anyone noticing? That doesn't change the fact that... What if he collapsed? That doesn't change the fact that... It's fine. I come here almost everyday for work. You're no help. Shut it! I'd like to focus. Sit down and shut up. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Okay. Fight! Fight! Fight! What is it, Yuri? Good work today. Yeah... Let's go. Okay. Let me do this. Please. But... This is what I want. I know it's silly and selfish. Please. I understand. What? I understand. Thank you. New Year Drama Special Life's Greatest Gift "Sasai Family Grave" Oh my, hello there. Hello. How annoying... Why is it times like these that I'm alone? They're only here when I don't need them. Honestly. Okay, okay, okay... You don't need to keep ringing. I'm coming. Huh? You're slow. Yuriko? Greetings. What happened? Nothing. Nothing? Don't you have a key? You don't need to ring the doorbell. I thought it'd be odd for a child that moved out and got married to just come in by herself. Is that it? Yes. So, what? What's this all of a sudden? I said it was nothing. Just nothing? Can I come in? Excuse me. I got it. Oh, do you? Did something happen? Like what? Something with Tabuchi? Or rather, Shigeyuki. Something like what? An affair, alcohol, gambling... What? He's not that type of guy. You know that. Wasn't he your student? Yeah, you're right. He's not the type of man to do anything crazy like that. Okay, then what? It's nothing. Who are you fooling? Would you rather it be something? Did I say that? But still... A daughter can't come back home without a particular reason? Is it a problem I came here unannounced? Don't be silly. But you seem bothered. Did I say that? In what world would a father not be happy to see his daughter? Don't they exist? What? There are a lot of families out there. They might not say they hate or dislike each other... But don't some kids and parents find each other difficult? You find me difficult. That's not... It's true. What about you? It's kind of... You know? Hm? It's really clean in here. I suppose. It creeps me out. Why does it being clean creep you out? What's all this? Ew... Gross. Gross? You have someone, don't you? Like who? You'd make your daughter say it? Huh? What do you mean? A woman who cooks here everyday. What's so funny? It's gross. It's me. Me. I'm the one that cooks here. What? Don't lie to me. I can tell by looking. Someone cooks here just about every day. It's the kitchen of someone who loves cooking. I told you. It's me. I'm the one who likes it. Did you just laugh at me? It's just... Really? Didn't I tell you? Look. "Sasai" What's so funny? But... But what? It's not funny. That's hilarious. That's so funny, my stomach hurts. I'm hungry. So what? I wanna eat. Please make me something. I'm hungry. I'm starving. I want to eat something of yours. What do you want? Something good? Okay. Hold on. Sorry. Here we are. Ooh, what's this? Let's eat. Okay. Why are you laughing? It's just... It's delicious. Why does that make you laugh? I'm crying. It's good. What the heck? Excuse me. Oh, Yuri! What's this? I was wondering who was laughing. Long time no see. Did something happen? No, nothing. Sometimes daughters suddenly come home without a particular reason. Ew. No, they don't, do they? Whose laughter did you think it was, Mitsuyo? Oh, you know he's popular with the young ladies in his cooking class. The other day the whole lot of them were here, weren't they? You don't need to volunteer unnecessary information. Cooking class... Surprising, right? Shut it! Sorry. Come on, you couldn't do anything around the house. She's right. It's not that I couldn't. I just didn't. Isn't that worse? Why? I respected your mother's work. Wouldn't she be upset if I did it all? I'm having a little trouble picturing that. Right? But you know... That's old history. Well, sorry. Isn't this a little...? What? Hmm, I think the shrimp's a little hard. Sorry. What? There's no way. Let's see... Still a long way to go. You should keep going to cooking classes. You're rude. I take after my father. I see. I'll go get the tea. Hey. What is it? What do you think is up? Oh, Yuri? Isn't it a separation? But why? You think I'd know the reason why? She said it's not an affair, alcohol, or gambling. There are a lot of reasons why a housewife might leave her home. Like what? Your wife never left? No, never. She was a patient soul. Huh? What's that supposed to mean? Why not ask Yuri directly? I tried, but she got angry. Then what about asking Shigeyuki? Ask him if there's a reason my daughter's returned? I can't do something that shameless. What a headache... Wait, wait, wait. What? Could you ask and find something out? Didn't my wife entrust you with things? She didn't entrust me with that. What? So on that note... Thank you for doing this for me, Mitsuyo. Huh? Dad. Yes? What's for breakfast tomorrow? Hm? I'm looking forward to seeing what you've learned in class. I'm going to take a bath now. Don't worry. It seems like she'll be staying a while. Yuri, good night. Good night. Wait... I'll see you tomorrow. I'm asking you... Oof. Hey, w... wait! That should do it. Okay. Good morning. Morning. Here you go. It looks good. What is this? Eggs benedict. An American breakfast dish. Impressive. Let's eat. It's good. Is it? There's coffee. Then I'll have some. Oh, okay. Good morning. Yuriko? You're here? Did something happen? Like a fight with your husband or a divorce? No. Ah, I'm sorry. Coffee. Huh? Just get the coffee. If you're having some, then get three cups. Will do. Oh, sir. How is the draft coming along? Not the time. Excuse me? Just hurry up. Okay... Hey. Yes? About... you know... What? Are you okay to stay a while? Yes. That's good to hear. So, how long? You want to know when I'm leaving? That's not it. I haven't decided. Is Tabuchi okay with this? He is. That's good. Yeah. Dad. Hm? What is it? When do you think lunch will be? You want me to make lunch too? I do. Hey, how's that coffee coming along? Coming right away. Yes. I understand. Oh, it's fine. Yes. Thank you. Yeah. Okay, good night. Welcome. Hey. What's with that? Don't come to the bar with grocery bags.. What was I supposed to do? The supermarket I like closes at eight. What? The vegetables are completely different. Right? Oh, the usual. Okay. You've changed. Ever since your wife died. I didn't think you'd end up like this. Really? My wife handled everything at home. The house was always clean. And the food was always good. But I took it all for granted. You know, when she was alive. Then she passed... And I was all alone in the house. I started thinking. How did she feel being in the house? How did she feel when she was doing housework? When she was in the kitchen... What did she think about while cooking? Those kinds of thoughts. Then I got the urge to try cooking. I got the urge to experience it too. You translators sure have a way with words. Shut up. And... And, you know. Once I started cooking, I found it fun. It's something men would get into, right? The tools and all that. Yeah, I get it. Men love tools. Right? It hasn't changed. Then what? Yuriko won't tell you why she's back? No, she won't. You know Mitsuyo? Yeah. Even if that lady hounds her with questions. Yuriko won't spill. And man, Mitsuyo really hounds her. I suppose there are things I'd find hard to say too. Although, I could say just about anything to my wife. Yeah, I guess. Has Ryoko ever paid you all a visit? I wouldn't call them visits. I know our houses are close, but it's endless. It's robbery, I tell you. Robbery? She's always coming over just to eat and run. Also, when she comes over for summer and winter celebrations, right? She takes everything. Everything! House and home! And everything she comes across... She's like, "I'll take this with me." Not, "Can I have this?" "I'll take this with me." She'll say, "Mom, Dad," "You're older now." "So you can't eat that much, right?" "It'd be a shame to let this go to waste." That's none of her business. Honestly. I hide the good stuff, you know. Like canned crab, Alaskan king crab. But yeah. Yuriko's not like our daughter. It's worrying, huh. Yeah. What should I do? Maybe I should consult my wife. What? Oh. Welcome back. Glad to be back. How's Mr. Tanabe? He's alright, yeah Here. You took this to the bar with you? Yeah, I did. You two know the deal, right? I'm counting on you. Absolutely do not let her find out. An old work colleague suddenly got hospitalized, so I left. I'm staying overnight. Got it? Yes, I've got it. Okay. But the thing is... What? Well, um, I hate to say it, but... What about work? I can't work if I don't find answers about my daughter. I understand. Please do find those answers. Yeah, I will. Okay, I'll leave you to it. Yes. Okay. Yes. It'd be nice if it were nothing. It would. I wonder if it is an affair or something after all... That's impossible. You're right. Shigeyuki's not the type to do that sort of thing. That's not what I mean. Hm? What? I mean, no one would cheat on such a lovely wife. What? Nothing. What's so funny? It's nothing. What is it? I'm home. Get it together. Yeah. Welcome back. Huh? Where's my dad? Someone, uh, he worked with a long time ago was suddenly hospitalized. So he's gone to visit. Right? Yes, that's right. Oh, who? He didn't tell us that much. Did he? No, he didn't. I see. He did say that he will probably spend the night. It seems so. I understand. Yes. Um...? What is it? Do you have any questions? Oh, it's just... Why are you two here? What? Um... That... He was in a hurry so he told us to tell you. Right? Right, so we waited for you. Thank you very much. Nice place. So this is what he sees everyday. Hey. Professor. Aren't you the teacher here? I quit the university a long time ago. Besides, shouldn't it be, "Dad?" Yes, I suppose, Dad. Good work today. Thank you. What seems to be the matter? Well... Could we talk for a bit? Nice place. You come here a lot? Yes. Yuriko likes it here. Is that so? Yes. Your face tells me you know why I've paid you the surprise visit. Yuriko came back unannounced. With this heavy luggage. And she says she'll stay a while. Of course, that's all fine with me. But she won't tell me what's up. She says it's nothing. But... it sure seems like something's up. I can't help thinking that. That's why... I decided to try to ask you. By the way, I haven't told Yuriko about us meeting. Did something happen? What is it? Can you tell me? Nothing happened. I'm still her parent. My daughter and I might not have had a close relationship. I might have left all the child-rearing to my wife. And I might have been solely focused on myself. You know, she said I found her difficult. No. That's not true at all. I don't think any father would dislike his daughter. No. I'm worried about her. I'd love it if there really was nothing wrong. But... There is. It's written all over your face. If there is, Could you tell me what? Look, I'm begging you. Please stop. You'll tell me? I'm sorry. You're a good couple, aren't you? That's a relief. Sorry. I came uninvited. Here's fine. Take care of yourself. Professor. Don't push yourself. Would you come to our place? I'd like to talk in private. "Shigeyuki & Yuriko Tabuchi" What I'm about to say now... Don't let Yuriko know you heard. Can you promise that? Can you promise that you'll treat her the same? I will. I promise. Yuriko... She has cancer. The time she has left is... Limited. That's... I'm sorry. I let her get sick while she was living with me. It's my fault. It's not your fault! She wanted half of her remaining time... That's what she said to me. Half? Yes. She wanted to spend it with you. My mom and I... We spent a lot of time together. I have a lot of memories with her. But I have so few with my dad. Before I die... I want to create some memories with my dad. My dad... I'd like to give him memories of our time together too. My mom's gone. And I'll be gone before him too. I feel sorry for my dad. Yeah. I don't want to tell him about my condition. I'd like to just spend some time with my dad. If he knew... It'd just be his time with his unfortunate daughter. I don't want that. I want us to fight. Laugh at stupid things. And eat together. That's the time I'd like to spend with him. It's like... We only ever looked upset at each other. Left as is... That's all our memories together will ever be. But Yuri... Please. When I reach halfway... I'll come back here. Let us be together in the end. Please. Let me do this. Please. That idiot... I... Decided to honor her feelings. Once she decided that, she seemed full of energy. I think she's in good spirits now. And if she thinks that energy has reached its limits, She'll come back to me. To me... That's an honor. I see. We were just starting fertility treatments. What? And while she was taking all these exams... They found it. He always looks angry. Well, maybe I do too. This way. This is.. I think she has them all. Hm? "This part's dated and a little hard to understand" "I love this part! Great translation!" Dad. Hm? Here. Thanks. When Yuriko was in middle school, She said she snuck into your study, And peeked at some work you'd started on. But... You came back. You asked her what she thought, right? She actually thought it was really gripping. But she said things like, "Whatever," or "I don't know." Yeah, I remember. And you ended up turning down that work. What? No, uh, you see... Of course, she never thought it was just because she didn't praise it. But she's always regretted that it may have played a small part. It became a best seller, right? The story you turned down. She thought that? I'm a bad father. Yuriko... I think she's actually a daddy's girl. What? She's a daddy's girl but not a straight shooter. She's difficult. And that difficulty... She got that from her father, huh? Those weird regrets... She seems to have a lot of them. There are others? A whole bunch. A bunch? Yeah. And in middle school, I was in theater. They gave me a really big part even though I was a freshman. But I had no self-confidence. I kept saying, "What do I do? What do I do?" around the house "I can't. I can't." "I can't do it. I just can't. I can't." I kept repeating that around the house. But while I really was afraid and anxious... I wasn't saying that I didn't want to do it, you know? I was happy that I got picked. I wanted to play a good part. So... I just wanted someone to say, "It's okay. You can do it." Yeah, I get it. Right? But my dad... "Shut it! If you can't do it, quit! Turn it down!" It really pissed me off. Thinking about it now pisses me off. If their dad says, "You can do it. Try your best," Then kids feel they really can try their best, you know. I don't remember that. I'm pathetic. Dad, are you okay? That's no good. You can't go back looking like that. You promised me, remember? Shall we drink for tonight? How long? What? How long... Will Yuriko be staying with me? She... Doesn't have very long. Next stop is Toden-zoshigaya. Damn it! You've gotta be kidding me. This is hard. This is unfair of you. It's all up to me. But... You did raise one fine daughter. Thank you. Could I... Could I be a good father from now on? Hey... what do I do? Shut it! Shut it! No, that's not how he says it. Watch this. Shut it! Spot on! Genius! No, it's probably because he says it to me so much. Which I'm not too happy about. Again, again! Yes, please, please! Again? You guys... Shut it! What's this? You're laughing like a bunch of idiots. People can hear you outside. I can't, I can't! Shut it! Welcome back. Yeah. You all really take it easy. Hey. What is it? It's obvious what it is. That's right. How did it go? Hm? Oh. It was nothing. That's a relief. It sure is. Sir, now you can focus on work, right? Not now. What? That's not what you said before. You're right. Okay, I got it. But that's great news. I'm relieved. Sorry for worrying you. Well then... I guess I'll start dinner. Hey, get your act together. What are you, a princess? What? Come help. Okay. What? Sloppy work. I'm sorry. Housewives only have so long to cook, So they can't just take their time. I see. You're still cutting those? You still haven't finished? Shut it. I'll be done soon. Should I help you? Yeah, please. Alright. So that's how you do it... Ow, ouch, ugh... I got it. Let's eat. It's delicious. It's good. Is there... Somewhere you'd like to go? Somewhere I'd like to go? With you? Hm? Yeah. Or, well, without me. I wanna ride a rollercoaster. Huh? Just kidding. There is a place I'd like to eat at on your dime. I really wanted to come here. Oh, really? What are you doing? Come on. Coming. Welcome. Have a look. I'll order. Okay. So for my daughter... Let's go with this. Yes. Then I'll have... Hello, Yuri? Yeah. What? Did my dad maybe come by? Uh, no, he didn't. Oh, I see. Okay, I understand. No, it's nothing. I'm fine. Yeah. Mhmm, talk to you later. Okay, good night. Such a bad liar... Excuse me. You catch on quick. I just happened to want a drink myself. I see. Here you go. Thanks. Um, is it funny to see me being serious about my work? Oh, I'm sorry... I really am. Isn't your apology confirmation that it is? I'm sorry. Hey. What do you think about this? You said the other day you wouldn't do that one. It's a young woman's collection of short stories. It's not normally the kind of book they'd send to me. But she's the daughter of an author I translated long ago. Seems to be her debut. I see. What do you think? Can I go get some coffee? Yeah, go ahead. Excuse me, sir. I'm not sure how much I understand with my level of English... Right. Yeah. But it seems interesting. I thought about how I'd love to read a Ryosuke Sasai translation of this. Really? Let's give it a try. Hold on. Sir? It's just... I got the urge to try it. I see. Anyway... Let's start by publishing one of the shorter stories in the magazine. How about that, Nomura? Well, I would like that. Then it's settled. Let's give it a go. We'll be busy for a few days. Pitch in. You're responsible for this. Okay. "Sasai" Thank you very much. Now I'll just send this straight to the publisher. Good. Yuriko. Yes? Thank you very much. Thank you. We're finally done. You haven't slept, have you? Nope. I think I'll have a little nap until evening. Go ahead. Hey. Hm? Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Hello? Oh, you're done. Good job. I'm really sorry for being so selfish. Thank you. Yuri? Could I come home soon? I see. Yeah. I'll be waiting. Alright. Bye. Okay. Yuri. Oh, Mitsuyo. Shopping? What are you making? Mitsuyo. Yes? Please look after my father. What? Oh, yeah, okay. You're leaving? Yeah. Another favor... Your dad's not gonna be able to escape me. It's already this late. Oh. Once in a while, you know... That's right. Wait, this is... This was my favorite thing Mom ever cooked. I liked it too. How do you make it? The key is frying it in sesame oil. Oh, sesame oil? Yup. And this is the secret ingredient. Honey... Wow, so this is why I could never replicate it. Mom invented this. Have it memorized? Yeah, I do. That's good. I'm glad I could teach it to you. So then... Can you make your mom's shiraae? Hm? There's no way you could. I'll try. Give it up. It's impossible. Can't you just tell me to try my best? You know, kids whose parents tell them that are able try their best. It's impossible. I'll try it. Help me out with it. Alright. Dad. Hm? What? I'm... I'm leaving tomorrow. Is that so? It is. Okay. Tomorrow... Do you want to see some rakugo tomorrow? Oh, wait, I just remembered. You don't like rakugo, do you? Why do you say that? Didn't you say that one day? Maybe when you were in high school. I asked if you wanted to see some rakugo. You made a scary face. "Not interested!" I didn't say that, and I didn't make that face. You did. "Not interested!" I didn't make that face. You did. Are you going then? I'm going! Then it's settled. It is. "Not interested!" You're being annoying... I'm looking forward to it. Also, about that... That huge suitcase. I'll use uh... A delivery service. I'll send it to you. What? You understand? A lady shouldn't be dragging around that sort of thing. It's unbecoming. Okay. Let's eat. Our love for our children never changes, does it? They say things like, "In this world of lies, a child's cuteness is the only truth." The love we have for our children remains unchanging in the face of changing times. There used to be two times a year you could go home. These were called "Yabuiri." January 16th and July 16th. After New Years and after Bon. When various festivities ended. There were two days a year parents and their children could be together. Those were the only rest periods, you know? I guess after Yabuiri came tears. "Honey. Honey." "What?" "What time is it?" "No matter how many times you ask, the answer's the same." "I'm asking you what time it is." "It's just a little past ten." "Didn't you say that before?" "It's because you haven't stopped asking." "Go to sleep." "I can't sleep." "He's gotten bigger, hasn't he?" "Of course he has. If kids shrunk, they'd disappear." "That's not what I meant." "He's sure grown up." "He should return to a warm meal." "I know." "He liked natto, right? That stinker." "Did you buy natto?" "We're all good." "Eggs?" "We have them." Hey, watch where you wipe. But... That was fun. It was. Yeah. Yeah. Here's fine. Not to the station? Is that right? It is. Dad. Hm? Thank you for everything. What are you saying? No... Thank you. Okay. Oh, I'll send you the book when it's done. I'll be waiting. So... So... Yuriko. Yes? Be sure to make that thing. The thing I taught you. Shiraae. Give your husband a taste. I will. Yuriko. It's okay. It's okay. You can do it. Try your best. I will. I'll try my best. Welcome back. Glad to be back. I had fun. Mhmm. I'm in your care from hereon. And I in yours. Well then. Shall I try my best, right to the end? Try your best. Yuri, are things okay? Yeah, they are. I'm okay. Your dad? Yeah, he made this. Wow. This is how it tasted. It's good. Right? How is it? Good? It is, isn't it? It's good! It's delicious. Come on... Don't come to the bar with tupperware. Shut it. Just try it. It's good. Isn't that what I said? Alright, let's toast. Huh? To our daughters. What? Just do it. Come on. Cheers. Subbed by Manx-Cat Subs
