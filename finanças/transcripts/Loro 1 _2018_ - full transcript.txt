Do not spoil the environment, the girls love these things old fashioned Yes I understand. What did you hear? Nothing. You did not speak Very well, Sergio Morra Do you know me? You do everything to make yourself noticed. So I studied you a bit far. It's something to me too I like to do. Who was the idiot on the phone? Nobody becomes the idiot with me, remember it. It is important. Because he has not come to the world yet a man that resists me Your... Would you resist me? In fact... now that I think about it, I do not see any obstacle. However, there is an obstacle. Oh yeah? I am the obstacle. You can never catch yourself to a girl like me. But comfort yourself, you are brave enough to be able to catch you all the others. Why? You, with whom do you take? With the same? You do not know how much would you give for knowing him. If you prove to be devoted and helpful with me, maybe one day I'll introduce you. This imbecile of Atilio never answer You know, this party He went to hell. - Do you want? - Leave it alone. I work tomorrow, Not like you, you get the lice. Take care of Kira. - It's more bad than Putin. - I imagine. But what class, huh? Class... Now, yes. 10 years ago, when he arrived from Albania, It was delivered to half Rome. You included? Do you take me for an idiot? Enough, Riccardo. How is it? Tell me. The best of the best. As soon as you take off Underwear... He puts it from behind. This is Rome, Sergio. As in Albania, they put it in your ass. OMG, what a surprise! Where did you hide? - I was in the bathroom. - We've been waiting for an hour. Riccardo, let's meet again. The less we see each other, the better. Bye heart. The makeup goes up to the brain. At the summit on hunger in the world, he said "It is necessary to shorten the interventions," "Because ours will not be a tragedy, but we are hungry too." When he starts talking, I do not know how it will end, if it will cry, if it will laugh. We are already crying, Cupa. Even when it makes us laugh. This year he brought us two things that we did not have without him: Economic strength and enthusiasm. But it is not enough anymore. What do you mean, Santino? Can you take care of the child? We are talking of serious things. Gino, why do not you go a little further? And you why do not you go to get your ass? I must say that we lost because the people, in the course of time, has made a kind of unconscious sum of all your nonsense, and when it comes to the result, is forced to conclude that is an imbecile. Explain yourself better. All processes which faces, and all the laws "ad personam" to go unpunished. You can have controlled all national channels, but people always it ends knowing and is shocked. All unfulfilled promises. The people see it. Your collaborator sentenced to 9 years by mafia association. The people get angry. To foreigners they say: "Come to die to Italy, we have abolished the tax to the inheritance." That was good, right? But you think it's smart go to television to say that the average of the Italian spectator corresponds at the mental level of a 7th grade boy Who does not even sit in the 1st row? It's him I should talk to. - Because is not like that? - It is true that it is so, but you must think about it, You can not say it. Cupa, he is 70 years old. The heart and the prostate in pieces, and he persists to use it anyway making all the gossip proliferate. I do not know, Cupa. I understand where you want to go. But you must have the courage to say it, Do not make me say it to me. Cupa, Would you support me? Support for what? To become in the next leader of center right. And will you be the President of the Council with those shirts? Do not. I use these shirts only for Promote the "Made in Italy". 2. 3. 4 00: 19: 52,160 -> 00: 19: 54,710 Cupa, you are a woman who never They have sent to talk to anyone. I want an answer from you. I'm on your side Try it. Dammit! Now, girls, it's our turn. Youth is a second. Do not let her go. Sergio... What are you waiting for? What did you do with my husband? But you did not love him! You did not love him anymore! 70% of its commercial value... It works, Sergio. Kiss it. Now. Cut! Morons, they drugged me They surrounded me with cats. I can not stand cats! Enough. Enough. And who are you? I? A discoverer of talents. To come here I told Puzzo who came to see the Pope. I must have told Saint I had a lunch. Have you never seen a hawk? I asked him to send me a picture of his cock. I wanted to cast a toe, I said no. Really, he says only beautiful things. Say what I do not know how to swim. I pretend to drink. I wanted to kill myself. I can only take in my house. Milan stimulates you. But it's so beautiful... I am distressed. Do not you feel something in your legs? Well, girls... Do you feel this perfume in the air Of summer? Huh, do you feel it? We do not feel anything, we have a closed nose. Amores... Thanks for having accepted My invitation tonight to dinner. I wanted to gather them here to announce them I had made the reservation for Villa Morena, and that since July 3 all They will be my guests in Sardinia. We will have an amazing party! Health! You have been very good. Really good. He will go crazy when he sees all these girls. They are perfect. For me, they are nothing special. To me, you are perfect. It does not work like that, Sergio. It never works like this with me. I saw him at a Forza Italia meeting, It is not that low I will present it to you when it comes to Bagaglino. It is slender. - We know each other? - Do not. I'm a friend of Palmira. The director. And what do you do? Figurant. And I study letters. - And what do you want to do when you grow up? - Actress. Film or television? Because it's not the same? Listen out... - Are you coming to my party in Sardinia? - I do not know. I would feel out of place. I do not drink, I do not use drugs. Look, what I can guarantee you is that in my villa in Sardinia, there will be a lot of producers parading - No, listen! - What happens? - That I never cheated Sergio. - It would be time. He is crazy. No, he is not crazy. And you have never helped him. He is unpresentable, you understand? I will not risk recommending a cocaine addict like him. Fuck you, Santino! Fuck off! I'm not going to cheat on my boyfriend! Shit! But what's wrong, are you 13? I never cheated Sergio. You just did it, dear. What a piece of shit you are! Did not you want to risk it? I'm going to tell everything, Santino. I will tell everything. Great piece of shit! Do you have any wishes, Sergio? I must say that some I have already made them. To have moved away from that hole of Taranto and my father. What's wrong with your father? It is honest, coherent. For him, life is a job and also It would have to be for me. You understand? I think your father is right. Because your life is exhausting? Completely. Life is hard when you do not know how to do anything When everything is over Only one mirror will remain, Sergio. You and I can not even get closer to him. Instead your father will look to himself with pride, and will say, "I've been honest" "and coherent." Enough, Kira, you're depressing me. I'm getting depressed too! - Believe in God? - Clear. Only on Mondays. - What does that one want? - According to you... It has bothered me for years. It would have been better if I took him with him 10 years, that would have stopped bothering me. And you, do you have any desire? 3. 4. 5 00: 26: 50,040 -> 00: 26: 51,400 Better than not. Girls like me are stupid when they dream With all the coca that girls consume and this story of the Villa in Sardinia, I'm spending everything. I'll have to invent something, but I do not know how I'm going to do. See that this story of the party in Sardinia will be the best investment of your life. Villa Morena is exactly in front of your property. He will see your girls parade and you will become recognized. Let's hope. Here it is, talking about the devil... I get warm when he calls you. Oh! Good to know. My love! I am good. I'm home with this friend of mine that later I must introduce you. He is a very smart boy. His name is Sergio Morra. Cool! Then you come to Bagaglino? Yes, I know I know, But in fact, they are inept... Where the fuck are they going with this majority of four cats? But look, in my opinion, you must have only a little patience, and you will go back to the government shortly. Am I boring you, treasure? You say your arm is falling just because it hurts! Do we do something after of the Bagaglino, love? Too bad you have to go. Yes, Geri was very happy. This Bagaglino is very boring. Not this time either is going to come to the party. Do not talk about him like that. I spent 300 euros on these clothes no way. The most powerful man in Italy he does not have time to come to Bagaglino. As if a dress was enough to seduce him. Did you look at me well, love? Hopefully it ends soon. My God, start again. - Who? - Santino, it's me. The check you gave me has no funds. 10,000 is not enough for me. Shut up, Santino! Shut up! Fool! I want 40,000, otherwise I speak directly with your wife. And another thing, tomorrow I will know if I got pregnant. And if so, get ready because you'll have to sell your pretty little house in Piazza di Spagna. Be fine. Could not we go by taxi? To this fucking restaurant? You're right. Instead we have to give a walk to see Rome. Why, I do not know her? Only Confalonieri knows it. - Galliani too. - No no. Galliani no. - Who told you that? - I know. - You should not have done it. - What? You ruined everything. You should not have done it. Oh! Is the! It's him and his escort! VILLA MORENA, SARDINIA Methylenedioxy-N-methylamphetamine, commonly called MDMA, stimulates the nervous system and has induction properties of the feeling of empathy. Comes preceded for a nice heat wave that comes from the bottom. This phase is defined with the verb "go up". The climb! It says: "Climb me up". - He has not uploaded me. - He has not uploaded me. Unlike cocaine, causes a state of gentle excitement called "the velvet". Sexual desire it is not predatory or voracious, but channeled through a feeling of universal love, directed to the neighbor and inanimate objects. A reduction is noticed in reasoning ability, an increase of sentimental disinhibition. That's why they call her the love drug. One of its most visible effects is the so-called "desmandibulamiento". Where the fuck are you, Silvio? We will have to stay always like this. We will have to stay all always like that. I love you, Sergio. I love you. I'm dying, that's all. Happy Birthday Madame. You did not make me laugh not even a little. I preferred when to conquer me you gave me a pair of shoes or a cashmere blanket, because you had discovered that was cold. Then I discovered that women He liked diamonds too. And the butterflies. Do not you take it? I try, but... I do not get it, I walk away. I always stay away. I felt very much about your sister-in-law. How are you, Doctor? A little broken balls, To tell you the truth. What's in there? - D'Alema, I'm going to throw it away. - That's fine. Dear Fabrizio, how are you? I would go with Margot, but it's better to stay at home and be a good boy. I must win back my Veronica. Grandma says you know the Latin names of all plants. It's true, I was in the Salesians. They gave great importance Greek and Latin. - What's that name? - Caryopteris. - Are you sure? - Of course. When they clean the pond, Where do the swans go? - They commit suicide. - Seriously? No, I was joking, we put them in the other pond. Does the volcano work, grandfather? Of course it works. One day I will show it to you. Look what a sea! - You know Putin, when ...? - Who is Putin? The head of Russia. Do you know that Putin, when he came here to see me, I was there in the sea, with two warships and the Moskova missile cruiser. A show! I do not believe you. You are skeptical today. It looks like you're going through a lot of time with the grandmother. Grandfather... 12 of my classmates They say you should go to jail. - How many are in the class? - 30 It's very good. According to a survey I commissioned, 30% of Italians he wants me to go to jail. Why? Because they accuse me of tax fraud, false balance, judicial corruption. All the crimes they commit the others, not your grandfather. - You will go? - No. Because I'm healthy. While the judges are upset and they hate you and me. And do you also hate grandma? No, because she is beautiful and read complicated books. I think that nobody should go to jail. You are a wonderful guarantor! I agree with you. The world with which I dream It is a world without prisons. - Grandpa, you've stepped on a poop. - No, I have not stepped on her. Yes, you just stepped on it. You know what the great scientist was saying English Isaac Newton? "Looks are deceiving only the mediocre." You are not mediocre, then you must understand that it is not like that. Grandpa has not stepped on a poop. It never happened to him in all of life and it will never happen to you. The gardeners have removed the terrain and, very often, there are pieces of land left that have a consistency very similar to poop. - Have you understood now? - Yes, grandpa. It looked like poop. But is not. - All right. What have you learned today? - That there is dirt that looks like poop. Do not. You have learned that a truth it is the fruit of tone and conviction with which we affirm it. So maybe poop? And maybe Newton He never said that phrase. It is important? Do not. The only thing that matters is that you have believed me. Mrs, Why always the same picture? When my husband likes something, he wants another identical one. Also with women it is like that. Who is that man who is Always with your husband, ma'am? Paolo Spagnolo. Is he a friend of yours? I do not believe it. My husband never likes it be alone and very rarely likes it be two. Paolo Spagnolo is the third. - Let's go with this one. - Very good, Doctor. But I remember him alone that in this shot, does not talk about the subject of constitutional referendum It does not matter In that shot, a concierge See me and think: "I would give this one to me." Will I go back to the government? I am 70 years old. If the left resists, it will last five years. At that time, I will have 75. Age does not matter, Doctor. A friend of my father-in-law is 92 years old, and still judo. Love, not now. I'm with the Doctor. I understand, I'm calling you, okay? I'll call you! In agreement? I'm sorry, Doctor. My wife, insists that I participated in "The Island of the Famous". He says that would be a good thing for my career. - I am your career. - That's what I tell him. Do you know how to play "Domenica Bestiale", of Concato? No, Doctor, it's not a song that I like. For me, yes. Is the song mine and Veronica's. It is very beautiful. Continue, continue. Only you You make me feel Inside the heart This love That I can not forget Listen, my little one, you take advantage How much I love you and then you pretend You're thinking of another and you do not tell me, no That you still love me and that you are happy This jealousy torments my soul Listen, my little one, you take advantage How much I love you and then you pretend You're thinking of another and you do not tell me, no This jealousy torments my soul It's been years since I buried my jealousy. I could not afford to be jealous being with you. - So what is the problem? - My dignity. That you should not touch it. - You do not give me permission? - So is. See you hidden behind of a bush to solve once and for all the problem of Violetta Saba it is the umpteenth attack to my dignity. And do not invent fancy things to make them pass for the truth. You can fascinate the Italians, not me. I've known you for 26 years. Is that why you're so cold with me? Yes. "Money should never be set aside, the thoughts and the feelings" "Because later they are not used anymore." Natalia Ginzburg has said it. It is the only thing said for a communist that I share fully. Veronica, I have to go to Rome for two days. It's because of the hair. It's not true that it's over Because you're here With the wrath of whom He can no longer scream How the days change When you want to change them When the cold between us Kill freedom For you, one hour is always One hour and a little more When the night is coming And you're awake This war that lies to the heart How long will it last? I've lost her, But maybe you have already won it Daddy! Michel Martínez! The heir of Maradona, Here you are! - Do you want to make a tour of visit? - With pleasure, Doctor. - What are you reading, love? - Saramago. That insults you It is always flattering to receive the attention of a Nobel Prize. I really liked "Essay about blindness." I agree, a masterpiece. You like? It's beautiful, huh? If chips for Milan, we make a great party with the volcano that made lava. - It's a show! - I imagine. Juventus made me an offer. Reject it, please. If I do not die. The temptation is strong why... I greatly appreciate the lawyer Agnelli, he has class. In Juventus, you will be front center. In my Milan, you would play number 10. They are the ones who make history. Those who win the Golden Ball. The others are extras. You are better than Maradona. Nobody understood it, I do understand football. I often change the formation, and I'm right I do not know if I want to have a president in the locker room. I do not know in Milan how many pretty girls and dancers would follow you. It is not my priority. You are gay? Look, I do not have anything against gays. And even, 25% of me is gay. Only that she is a lesbian. Even though I live with my mother, I'm not gay. It's just that I'm not interested in beautiful girls. - They are frivolous, exhibitionists... - Bravo, Michel. Also, they distract you of the important things. On the other hand, a mother, A mother is very important. Who is your idol? Gullit. And yours? My father. Agnelli would have said. Dear Michel, Agnelli inherited his fortune. I built it. Write a number As you see, in Milan, You can really have it all. Everything is not enough. In your opinion, Do you think it's fair that I'm still in opposition? Not for me. I receive it in the cactus. Dearest Minister! Presidente! - How are you? - As a rich retiree. The communists have ruined my government, and my children the companies. I have Veronica, who sees me as if it were the origin of all evils. You tell me your? You look worried. It's not about politics, It looks more like a girl. - But how do you do to know? - Santino, I do not know anything. I understand. A seducer and a lover of my caliber understands quickly when Another man suffers for love. Precisely from that I wanted to talk to you. Let's make a pact, that you do not omit the name. If not, I will spend all the time thinking about who it is, I will finish by not listening and then I will not be useful to you. Tamara Morra, do you know her? Of sight. A beautiful woman Galbiati kept it. I remember it, because once Galbiati used a phrase which seemed improper. He said: "It's my whore." It is also mine. Now he blackmails me. You understand? I'm terrified, Silvio. Terrified. I see my brilliant reputation destroyed in a second. Obviously, we are in the face of a delicate situation. And this is my problem, you know? I fall in love with only the whores. Do you know why, Santino? Because you too You are a whore - Anyway, I'll try to help you. - Thanks, Silvio. Now, recite a beautiful poetry in my honor. Yes. Cool thinking oriental generosity, Persuasive smile... Foolish fool, evil Judas ridiculous little animal... Have you seen?, I am also a poet. And these verses are for you. Excuse me, Silvio, but I do not understand. You have to understand three things, Santino One: I'm young. Two: You are old. Three: If you want to take my place, first You have to come talk to me. Without conspiring to my back. - Who told you that? - Cupa. She does a double game, Silvio. He pushed me to nominate me as your heir. Now comes to tell you that I have ambitions? She set a trap for me, Silvio. Listen to me well, Santino. He who is not with me, It is against me. And outside the match will be politically beheaded. You were in the sun, now you will enter a cone of shadow. Locked in a dark room. Those on TV will no longer look for you. Our allies They will destroy your reputation. - I'll liquidate you with a word. - No, Silvio, I do not deserve it. I became lonely. Fuck you, Santino! In Italy, there is only one that was made alone, and that is me. You are just a vulgar parasite about politic. - And you broke my balls! - Silvio, I beg you. Doctor, has left the phone in the house. Another brilliant idea of ​​Veronica: A day without a telephone. Binoculars. What is that awful thing? I made it. Actually, I do not dislike it. Do you know that you are becoming in a good sculptor, love? But where is Mariano? In the village, Doctor. Are you dizzy. You feel lonely? No love. Is that the sound from the sea bothers me. A little music by Mariano I would have calmed down. Agnelli, on his boat he had a portrait of him made by Bacon. We have Apicella. We also have your fantastic sculpture. But why on television Have you never done a cultural program? I did it. - We had Mike. - Mike Bongiorno? These were competitions. General culture contests. And why did you fire him without even Do not even make a phone call? Daniela called me, his wife. He says he was very bad. It was not my decision. Mike allowed you to begin. He gave you everything for 30 years. He is just waiting for a call. I would, if I only had here my phone. Antonellina, do you have a phone? Yes doctor. Do you have the number of Mike Bongiorno? No, Doctor. You see? What happens? Mystery. I do not understand anything about engines. What do we do now? Do you understand the utility of cell phones? Let's wait and enjoy the sea. - Are not you afraid of emptiness? - No, I look at it from a distance. When I was 8 years old I decided I would not do the first communion. So it was. A woman of character. That's why he loved you so much. You loved me so much because I was 24 years old and it was beautiful. No, Veronica, you have been imprecise. You were not beautiful, you were a beauty Awesome. It was useful. Now I am 50 years old and I am no longer needed, neither for me nor for others. I can understand you. The monstrous Suspicion of being superfluous It's something that is killing me, Michel Martínez willing to go to Juve despite to earn less. I can not go back to the government. I am a man of action. I can not live without projects. Why can not I perform Not even one, Veronica? Why? When the despair begins, I think now I buy you a gigantic house. We already have twenty, Silvio. We have it all. Everything is not enough. - Who said that? - I. If you really want to reconquer me, Why do not we make a trip to Cambodia? Walking. To see the temples of Angkor. Do you want me to fix you a date with Maltese? Look, he's a formidable neurologist. Do you remember that two years before that we were together, You wooed me at a party all night? You already told me that, but I do not remember. Do you remember at least the song that We listened when we gave ourselves the first kiss? Do not. I swear I do not remember it. Do you remember the names of the servants of all the villas but you do not remember our song? See what love is also made of these details. Is this song by chance? Manfredi, do not make me sick! Silvio, I have a heritage of $ 1.7 billion dollars. I'm 882 in the Forbes ranking of the richest men in the world. And I'm the 19th richest man from Italy. I became immensely rich thanks to two factors. One: We are partners for years. Two: I never gave up my principles. And I even followed them. Now... after years of gain, our customers have lost a lot due to a bad placement. It's my fault, my fault, my great fault Now, my proposal, that can seem crazy, is this: We're going to reimburse them, Silvio. Let's reimburse them. No financial company would do something like that. That's why we have to do it. Let's reimburse them. They will thank us. It will cost us 160 million euros, it's a part of the profits, but I'm sure that after of this gesture, the amount of investments will increase. Let's do it, Silvio. Let's do it! Being good is convenient, I always say. Altruism is the best way to be selfish This is another of my principles. It's okay, Ennio, let's do it. You are a genious. - But it's your idea. - That's why you are! Only a genius gives 160 million euros thanks to the idea of ​​another. Now, tell me why you are unhappy. 25,000 people - So few? - Yes So few. Do you understand that I lost the elections for only 25,000 votes? That translated to other numbers, Would it be only 6 senators of difference? Exactly. And you get discouraged by so little? This is not the Silvio I know. - What should I do? - It is simple. Convincing six senators so they can pass by your side. At the first loss of confidence, the government falls, you go to elections, you win. And you go to the government. Convince six senators? What have we done all our lives? Silvio! We sold! We are sellers and we are the best! What is a seller, Silvio? Two things. A salesman is a man who is alone. But this does not interest us, because it would make us sad. Let's leave it aside, but remember it. A seller is a man alone, maybe the loneliest man in the world, because he always speaks and never listen What interests us, It is the other thing. A seller is a persuader. We convince our neighbor. People, in principle, do not want buy never. He is afraid. This is where we arrived. We convince them. And what do we convince them? We convince them of kindness of our dreams. We do not get up from the negotiating table, until our dreams do not also become yours. And then, they buy. And we are happy. And this, dear Silvio, You showed it to me. Because you are the biggest seller that I have never met in my life. It was another life for me, Ennio. I do not even remember how it is done Nobody changes, Silvio. Nobody can run away from himself. That's why you remember everything. Many years ago, when you were builder, you made a city and in the middle of real estate crisis, when not No department was sold, you sold everything. You are the man who modified the route of the planes that passed about the houses of Milano 2 because they were devaluing dizzily. From a TV station of closed circuit neighborhood, you made the greatest empire private television in Europe and the you sold to all Italians. I have to continue or can I stop here? In summary... Do you say that I should convince to six senators so they can pass me by? Yes, that's what I say. You summon them, you convince them. You sell them the dream of the future. Give yourself completely, Silvio. Altruism is the best way to be selfish Ennio, the best business of my life, It has been associating with you. Also mine, Silvio. Mine too. Hello? Good evening, Elide. Who? Augusto Pallotta, head of real estate sales of the company Pallotta SRL. And you think a schedule to call the house of people to sell an apartment? Yes ma'am. Because at night, people we cultivate our dreams well. Listen, I have no time to lose. Me neither, ma'am. If I call her, it's because I guarantee her that we're not just wasting our time, we are improving it. I do not want any apartment. Yes, ma'am, everyone dreams with owning a house. And if they already have it, they dream of a bigger, more comfortable, more beautiful. Or they even need one for a son who is going to get married Do you have children, ma'am? If a girl. I listened... Would not you want to see it in your daughter's eyes the same joy I had at 8 years old when he recited poetry at school and you were there looking at her? Would not you want to make a great gift to forget that day in which you, madam, I was sitting on the couch, crying, and his daughter came from behind and told him, with sad voice: "Mom, I'm here and I love you."? But who are you? I'm Augusto Pallotta, ma'am. In my life I have sold more than 15,000 departments. Tomorrow you can verify it. Do you want to know why I sold so many? Because I do not sell only apartments, I sell a dream. It's late to dream. And who said it? I still did not say anything. I did not speak to him yet of our credits at rate 0, I did not tell him even my dream and you have not told me yours. Listen, let me continue with my thing, I was watching "The Day of Tomorrow" on Channel 5, I want to know how it's going to end. But I'm telling you, ma'am. Ends well. Loretta and Flavio have another child and they are together again. Madam, would not you like that his life resemble that fiction what are you seeing? I can do it! I can do what! Listen to me, ma'am, me neither I have time to lose. I would have hung if it were not because we are building right near his house, in Borgo Roma. My men are making the list of the inhabitants and they gave me their card. I do not want to sell you the first one that passes, no. I want to sell to people like you, fine people, good people that have a pain I feel, in his voice, a pain that comes from afar. And I know that you not only have the need to leave that pain behind, he deserves it. Do you understand what I am saying, Mrs? You deserve to bury that pain. Because it's not your fault. It's true that it's not my fault if that imbecile He's gone with a 24-year-old beautician. Listen to me, lady. I'm a man. For me, it would be easy, natural justify her husband, but I am respected in my work because I'm only telling the truth. And the truth is that men they are limited beings, they are slaves of puerile temptations. They do not see the future, and this is why they lament. I know that her husband he has already tried to return home because I could not keep up a twenty-year-old and you just He has sent him for a walk. To the first problem, the girl got fed up. And he wanted to return to you with excuses and promises. But to you, those excuses and those promises They sounded old. While you, instead now, just want something new And I am the angel of the night that I have come to give him that novelty. But you, how do you know all those things about me? I know the script of life. It does not become one in the best seller from Italy if the pains are not known and the wishes of the customers. And I have chosen tonight a single client. You. You are too invasive, I do not trust. It seems like a fraud. In my opinion, it is you just a cheat. Have you heard me? Have you been offended? Okay, I'm sorry to have called you cheat, but I do not know him. Good. Then goodbye. 120 square meters oriented to the south. One kilometer from his house on Manzoni Street 21, in a modern residence. The lounge? I am 1.70 meters tall. Imagine me lying down and multiply by 7, will have the length of the walls. Balconies of 3.50 meters deep of the entire width of the department, air conditioning in all the rooms, electric shutters. The refrigerator is provided by us, controllable when it is not, from your cell phone. We even provide you with the cell phone. A technician will explain how to use it. The apartment is beautiful, but the residence is dazzling. There will be golf carts available at the entrance to add new friends from other units.

Large playground area for the visits of the nephews, fruit trees, a center recreational with art gallery, a small amphitheater for performances theater because culture is fundamental. And a real volcano with fireworks for owners' birthdays, because the holidays They are also fundamental. Tennis, reduced soccer, the gym, the ice cream parlor, the pizzeria, two restaurants one fish, one meat and finally, an old merry-go-round. In the center of the square. Tell me, have not I thought of everything? I must say that really He has thought of everything. Is it really 1 km from my house in Manzoni? I have not seen anything. Because now they are only you flat. The play It starts in a month. The sign is in 6 months. But... there is a small problem. Which one? It's a little more expensive than market prices. That might not be a problem. I always have to sell the business from my mother, in the center. Have you heard me? Is he still there, Doctor? I am always for you. Before, he asked me if he had offended me. I never offended. If you had done it to another What you did to me With this sea it looks like a Greek god. That man would have killed you Do you want to know why? Because on this earth Women like you They should not exist for a man Honest like me Woman You're a bad woman That his eyes made me cry Tears of infamy Woman You're worse than a viper That the soul has poisoned me I can not live anymore Woman You're sweet as sugar But that angel face I used to cheat you Woman You are the most beautiful woman I love you and I hate you I can not forget you Only! You are big! Veronica... Silvio, I've fallen in love with you. Pest control Silvio, thank you for having me forgiven. Listen, I've talked to my uncle. That's why I've forgiven you. What did he say? He says that your idea of convincing to 6 senators is beautiful, poetic, but useless, Silvio. We need some something else... concrete, more material, he says. I have understood Dear Senator, Have you offered something? Yes, thank you, I have asked a soda Arnone. Incredibly there was, I never find it. We have everything. Do you want to take a tour of the mansion? With pleasure, thank you. - How was the flight? - Perfect. Thanks to the private plane that you have made available to me. How is your son?, Michele, I think. Well well. He just graduated, is looking for a job. And tell him he just found it. insurance that will have a job in one of my companies. Would not there be a conflict of interests? Dear Senator, now I will tell you about a dream. Allow me, Doctor, yes for once you will listen and I will speak? Would you want that I passed on your side and to contribute, with the vote of five other senators, to make the most of center left fall of which I am part. He asks me to betray him. But in love he betrays himself, in politics, he changes his mind. Sacrosanct! But I doubt to change of idea. And do you know why? Not because you have defined to the judges as subversives or because he had an employee that he was a gangster. The laws "ad personam" who are looking for economic benefits or to avoid ending in jail, They are not the problem either. Because the richest man in the country, owner of three national networks It can also be the head of government. Nor because his policy be alone populist propaganda on the back of the poor people. If these insinuations of yours they are not prejudiced excuse me, huh? But why did you come here to tell me that it will not happen from my side? But I wanted to spend on your side. That is the point. The problem is that while I expected it, - I remembered one thing. - What? What he said about you the writer Javier Marías. Oh, God, another! What did you say? What did you say? He said that when you participate in meetings international, feels like the homeowner. You make jokes, antics, just because it has a gigantic Inferiority complex. That's why I can not move on his side. Your inferiority complex It generates shame. And feel ashamed, believe me Doctor, it's something that at my age, I can not afford. Dear Senator, Do you know what happens when others try to do psychology about me? No what? Nothing. Nothing happens. And he knows what happens when I I do psychology with the rest? No what? Start the lap counter. I start to earn money. How is your cultural foundation, Rizzo? Indebted at two million euros, but... Ready. 20 seconds, time what it takes to my companies to bill 2 million of euros. Could you, next time, vote on our side? Listen, could you combine to the Barletta as German Chancellor? I'm interested in getting a 60-year-old German actress. Very good, Martino, the Barletta is not for me. It is related to a Senator that I'm trying to convince to go over my side. It's fine. I think it can be done, Silvio. La Barletta will walk very well. Martino, you're the best. And could you help me with the Gardin? Well, Silvio, to the Gardin we saw her for the role of Marietta, let's say it's a bit too... as we could say... modern Do you think? Now that I think about it, the Gardin He went very well. Let's be honest. Do you know what the problem is, Silvio? The problem is that they all want to interpret to Joan of Arc, Mata Hari, Rita Levi-Montalcini. They're fools who do not know recite, but who does not know? - Listen, how are we going with the senators? - I'd say pretty good. - Silvio, have you read? - What? The newspapers. They have posted the listeners of your communications with Martino. I am quoted. The journalists are coming. What do I do? For now, you should not call me, because sure you have the phone tapped. Excuse me, I say goodbye. - Wait! And we? - We, what? Why are you like this? You are cold. I'm not cold. I am intervened. And my role as Santa Teresa de Ávila? I've studied a lot. And my political role? And my reputation on the international scene? And the reaction of my children. When you read this? And the wounded dignity from my wife? Do not call me anymore, Manuela. Where are you going? To Cambodia on foot. To see the temples. - You are angry with me? - Do not. With me. - Are you leaving the center right? - Yes. And with many remorse. I join the mixed group. The content of these communications. It is unacceptable. I'm sorry for my relationship with President Berlusconi, but honestly, I did not have knowledge of his dark side. I feel hurt as a member of your group, but especially as a woman. Gaia, listen to the Doctor, one thousand lira per month, one thousand lira per month. - Silvio, have you seen what talent? - I studied whistle technique in Dubai. And besides, it's beautiful. She was dying to meet you. Very good, Fabrizio. Take it back with you. And go yourself too, Fabrizio. Dear Veronica, I am also reading. I also have a favorite writer. It's Dino Buzzati. I learned a memory passage. While you're at a cocktail party and that you touch the backs of young women or that you dance, your breasts against your chest, at that time, in a small room full of smoke, a young man is working. Maybe it's bothering while he is doing what you have to do. That's it. The young man in the small room, It was me. But now I'm not anymore. Happy birthday! I made my wish! My love, 30 years, is that slab! It's that slab! You can not get in. Are you kidding? I direct this place. But you can not enter. Further, A small warning: I never joke. Silvio, do you know Sergio Morra? Yes, I have heard talk. Well, I hope positively, Mr. president. Did you receive the sweater What did I send you, president? Yes, dear, I think so. Kira told me that you organized a party with many girls. Yes, we have a lot of fun, president. Come home tomorrow, There is too much quilombo here. With pleasure. Can I introduce you to Tamara, my girlfriend, president? Haunted. Do you want to dance, president? Why not? My God, thank you, president. Where are you from, Tamara? From Rome, president. But then I met Sergio and I followed him to Taranto. About that, Santino is still in love with you. I feel tired. I will not be late. Hello! Good morning, president. Tamara did a tiramisu for the splendid necklace he gave her last night, president. You rented that house and you filled her with beautiful girls so that I would notice you. Congratulations, you did it. Congratulations, president. - Why? - Because of the fall of the government. Great, the move to convince to the six senators. After the elections, will rule again. I have already thought about making the first advice of ministers, I want to do it in Naples. City that I love, garbage cover. I will grow the south, I will create new jobs, there will be liberalization, I will lower taxes, and I will promote development. And I will make the bridge over the Strait of Messina. - And Cupa Caiafa... - He made the stupidity of his life. She believed that I was not capable to make the Government fall. First error. Then he tried to confuse things with the mixed group. Second mistake Now his right match is put together looking to get me some seats. Third mistake Because he will not have anything. But you, what do you want? My dream is to become in a MEP. Or if not, enter the world of works public, maybe with your support, president. I would like to invest. I will introduce you to someone. Sergio, I want to make a great party, with girls. How many do you have? 28, Mr. President. - They are few. - I can find many more. They must be reliable. I allow to enter with cell phones, but I do not want find me with videos that come out of here. Remember that this villa It is a state residence. I would miss more. Tell them to come dressed simply, light makeup, without heels. We are not tall. Nothing to pay. I never had the need, I like to seduce. What need can it have? They all love him, president. He does not know how they insist on knowing him. When Playboy did that survey of the sexiest politicians, I was literally harassed. The other day a girl called me: "President, what should I do? To go to bed with you?" I told him to call to my secretary. For food, I thought pizza and champagne. Can it be good? And then Michele will make ice cream artisanal for all. Oh, and no drugs. It's something I can not tolerate. Absolutely, president. I will have also a little surprise, a dance... It is possible to sleep here. It's okay, president. Come, and bring your girlfriend back. Beautiful... No, there is no tuna. Do you have a master? Then, put on glasses and come with a newspaper. He likes that guy. Livia, do not disappoint me. So, you come? Listen, there will be all the colors, but that does not matter to you. Now girls, go fast to eat. Then we do the dance. It's boring. Why do you want to see me? Because I want to give you a chance. - You to me? - I to you. I need girls, that's your thing. They serve me, Many are on vacation. I do not give a shit. You're covered in debt. Bring the girls, I will convince him to help you. You to me? All the shit... ends in the bathrooms. Love?, We start again. Have you seen how many books they took the trouble to write against me? The left can not put me in focus. They think that everything It is always complex. On the other hand, everything is elementary. He has the charisma of the stream. Bring the valley freshness and well-being, and satisfies thirst. That is all. Now listen to me, girls. I have the charisma of the stream. He has the hands of a king, I should wear a ring. My son will study books about him at school. Is incredible! Employ at least 10,000 domestic workers Do you think he is crying? His wife is crazy. He is not as short as they say. His eyes have an oriental charm. I would like to live in your head. When he dresses as admiral, Makes me crazy. Tell me it's true. It is true. How many beautiful girls we have tonight! Thank you! It's time to tell you a joke. Silence! Do you know what the difference is? Between Christianity and communism? First preach poverty... The second makes it a reality Now, if they want they can go dancing Facts by Michele, there are handmade ice creams for all. They can go around in the merry-go-round. Be free, girls. Have fun. Have fun. Enough. Mr. president, excuse me. As for my desire to become in a MEP, I was thinking on the question of Georgia... I ask you please... Why do you want to ruin everything? Stella, Why do not you come and sit down here by my side? Actually right now... I have to go a moment to the bathroom. Kira, excuse me for a minute. What the fuck do you want? Fuck off. But... girls... Do you know why this happens? Because I for him I am something accessible. And Stella is ten years younger than me. Do you feel old? I feel stupid. Why do you do it? It does not cost me anything. And men love it. No, you love him. Can be. President, what are you doing here? I want to show you something. It's fun, is not it? Do you have... a very beautiful skin. Not coming? There are very important old people there. People who decide the destination of the actors on television. I have been told that you wanted to be an actress I'm not so sure Then maybe you are interested in politics I really need young women, beautiful and smart like you for the next European elections. I want to rejuvenate all the parliamentary arch. Except you. You really have beautiful skin. And a mouth even more beautiful. Do not you like it tonight? Can I speak freely? You are in the house of liberties. No, I do not like. Why? What do you not like? There is music, joy, good food. And then? That... You can decide only you. You are angry with me? If you lacked respect, I apologize. No, you have not disrespected me. In their own way, He is kind and gallant. So what is it what does not go? It is that it has the breath my grandfather's. Which is not even perfumed not unpleasant. How is it? It's just the breath of an old man Excuse me, I did not want to offend you. I never offended. I feel uncomfortable. I'm sorry, but why? Because I am 20 years old and you 70 Because I'm pathetic for being here and you are pathetic. So much when he compliments me or when he apologizes. It is pathetic that removed the shoes, who has sat with legs crossed to become the young... Everything is so pathetic, President. And sad. With sadness nothing is built. Not even a fuck. But at your age, joy It should be a civic duty. At my age, joy It's just a wish. What do you do? I think is better let me go, now. Summer has ended to me. But come on, stay. Perhaps let's throw the volcano. It's a show! How are we wrong? When we think of being smarter than them. You are pregnant? I was. Jump! Jump! I swear to be faithful to the Republic, loyally observe the constitution and the laws. And exercise my functions in the exclusive interest of the Nation. What happened, ma'am? I lost my teeth while running. I will send you a new one. Thank you. I am 1.70 m tall. Imagine me lying on the floor, and multiply by 4, This is how your living room will be. You will all have an anti-seismic house in record time. L'Aquila will have a New Town because I always keep my promises Jesus Christ! Give us Jesus Christ! Call Mike, suffer. There are many voices that say that I'm not interested in governing, that I dedicate myself only to girls, what... Unfortunately the voices will be even more numerous if you will not speak at the UN next week. I suffer from the back. The UN allows you to speak also with back pain. - Send Santino. - It's you they want, not him. I understand them. There's another thing, delicate and annoying It seems that it was written a kind of decalogue, approved by different ministers of Foreign Affairs, about how you should behave when you concur to international summits. No kisses, hugs, pats on the back, jokes, rabbit and cuckoo ears. I do what I want. My electorate finds sympathetic my behavior with the heads of state. Try to at least avoid the jokes. In what way does it bother you? And Churchill, then? His jokes have made history. Silvio, Churchill had to exorcise a world war. President, everything is ready for the massage. Paolo, Would it make sense a museum about me? Not yet, Doctor. New York? No, Naples. You are the best! Welcome home, my love. Do you like the temple? I had it built for you. Do you want to spend a weekend in the house of Portofino? Do you know why I came back? First, for the opera. And then because Cambodia, in the long run, is exhausting. I divorced again. You will not believe the things they write the left newspapers? Do not you understand that it's just a plot to destroy me? The left forgave you, That was his biggest mistake. Try to be a man, Silvio, not a clown. You are not on television, we are only you and me. A wife and a husband at the time most painful of its history, that of failure. I came back alone to tell you that I close the chapter of my married life with you. Why? Are you sick. - Let's see... - You need a psychiatrist. I beg you, finish now. You are melodramatic. - I'll try to be a little less. - Very well. Was not there a shell here? A man, a father of a family who walks with minors, what is it? The head of a government in a country that fills your whorehouse, what is it? A leader who presents beautiful girls to the European elections, what is it? A sick maniac. That is what it is. Was I less melodramatic? Do you remember what the Borboni said? When did you recite in the theater? "You were fine, dear, but it's a pity not to have heard anything." It does not offend me. I know I've never been a good actress Not only were you not an actress, You were also a beautiful girl. Although now they would not call you that. Very well. So remember that this pretty girl it has become in the mother of your three children. Look at what you have become. That's why I felt the need to look for company Is that the theory of your henchmen? "The wife neglects her husband, He seeks consolation with minors and whores." But what minors? Naomi is the daughter from a socialist I've known for years. Elio Letizia! So, who is it? He was Craxi's driver. Craxi's son said the driver His name was Nicola. Letizia does not know anyone. It's one I had to talk to for the candidacies in Naples. A merchant in perfumes. Why does the leader of a party discuss something So important with the owner of a perfumery? Veronica, do not be ridiculous. I'm not. It's you who is ridiculous, Silvio. And pathetic. You are a sick man, Silvio. And not because you like women, because you had better things to do than women and you did not do them. You had a great opportunity. Take care of the Italians and you did not. Because the Italians have never interested you. You are only interested in yourself. That's what makes you sick, Silvio. And if there is a God somewhere, you know that He will never forgive you for what you've done, ever. You wanted to be a statesman and even president of the republic. But you are still a traveling salesman. As a young man, at least You were a salesman. Once in government, you sold everything: you sold the culture, the hope of the people, the dignity of women and you sold me I've sold you? I put you in the center of the world, when that world was about to forget you, before remembering what your name was. With what right do you come to tell me these evils? What have you achieved? In the life to allow yourself these harsh accusations? Only because you raised three children, You think you have that right. Now that you have said who I am, I will tell you who you are. You are a woman who does not have No vitality, you're cold, formal. You have built a full world of unbearable rules. Before laughing, I asked you if it is fair to laugh. But what life is this? I will not have rules, but at least I'm alive. Vital. In the end, I can say that I enjoyed of the opportunities that life offers. While you always you have thought that everything was a long and painful acceptance of responsibilities. This is sad! Much more than my behavior! You have no real stimuli. All those things: philosophical theories absurd, the temples, the sculpture, They are all shit. Shit! Deceit of those who do not want to face life as it is. And you have been able to avoid facing the life that is made of shit, of humiliations, thanks to my money. I have gone to get my hands dirty for you and our children. And I did it better than anyone in this country. I built an empire economic and political. Well, Silvio, fine. We've been telling you all our lives that you are great We can not do it anymore. Do you wanna know the truth? It's false. It is not true that you are a great entrepreneur, because you cheated all your life. How naive you are! What do you think they do the other entrepreneurs in the world? Do you think they are all examples of righteousness, except me? I reveal to you a truth that never It came to your crystal bell: they all act like me, everyone is ready to remove or to lower the obstacles. Only I did it better than all of them. Because I'm the best. You are just a child who is afraid of dying But I must be honest with you until the end. You are not good. You survived thanks to Craxi and criminals who did the dirty work in your position. And that for this reason They ended up in jail. And your television channels, Silvio? I'm sorry for disappointing you, but you did not invent absolutely nothing. You just filled the grid with advertising, promotional messages, soap operas, varieties, old vulgar movies and idiot questions programs. You always boast but you're worth less than what you think. So, for years, you've always thought that I do not have any quality Why did you stay with me all this time? You and your friends they have ruled this country moved only by impulses sexual, vanity and preservation of money. And now that you're divorcing, Are not you interested in money? I only think about my children. That is the great alibi of all women in the process of separation. - Answer my question. - You make me feel sorry. You and your friends. They are a movie of Totò and Peppino. Provincianos with their wool stockings, a silly voice, with the tongue hanging in front of the ballerinas of the magazine. This is what they are. An old version that He pretends to be modern in a comic movie. You have not responded, dear. Why did you stay with me all this time, if you have always thought that did not have any quality? I beg you to answer me. Answer you, for once, what everyone asks you: What is the origin of your fortune? My father lent me 30 million liras to get started. Is not true. They were 113 billion liras. And nobody ever understood where they came from. Answers! I use my right of not responding I'm not the judge. For me it is as if you had answered You have not responded. You never reveal yourself. Not even me. You are a very long staging uninterrupted, Silvio. And you, you are not also a long staging? I fell in love with a beautiful Emilian girl, with that beautiful Bologna accent. What's left of that healthy girl, intelligent and cheerful, with a head full of desires? You give you airs that I do not understand. You are eternally distant, urticante, formal. I never reveal myself, Veronica, but neither do you... I do not recognize you anymore. Do you know what's left of that girl? Nothing. Nothing remains. I have aged. And I have aged badly. - And it's my fault. - I did not say that. Please answer. Why did you stay with me all this time, if you have always thought that did not have any quality? Because I was in love. That was your quality. You made me fall in love Call Mike. You hurt her Doctor, I'm going to go. - Where are you going? - How come where do I go? To the Island of the Famous. With two suitcases? There you can not even take it a toothbrush. I will hide them. What's inside? Mozzarella, provolone, coffeemaker. Come back soon. If I'm late, it's because I won. Then come back soon. Why do not they let me rule, why do not you let me guide the country How have I guided my companies? In contrast, the left judges they torment me with their processes, my political adversaries they attack me every day and everyone gets morbidly in my private life. I do not understand. But what did you expect? Being able to be man richest in the country, be the Prime Minister and also that everyone I love you with madness? Yes. I expected exactly that. So you never got off the cruise where we sang as boys Or maybe I never went up. Do you know something? The other day I saw a weekly. They had published all the photos of your supposed brides. And I realized that they all looked like Veronica. Silvio, why do not you go back to try? One day there was a girl. His name is Stella. I went to her and I said: "You have the breath of my grandfather." "It's not perfumed" "Not unpleasant." "It's just the breath of an old man." I did not have the courage to tell him the truth. Evidently, his grandfather and I use the same brand of cleaner for dentures. It's late to reconquer to Veronica. Fedele, it's late. I had big dreams, they became nightmares. Daniela was very worried for me when they fired me I thought I would have a hard time. And I was wrong because you are not me fired you. Daniela said: "But why Silvio Do not you call?" "They have shared a lifetime of work." I answered: "You'll see, Silvio is going to call me," "Just have a free moment." I was right. You're sad, Silvio. Its the first time I see you sad. I had fun alone when he sold houses. As Enzo Biagi let it be understood, I went into politics to avoid imprisonment, save furniture and maintain the control of television. But I really wanted Do something for my country. As I said when falling in battle: Italy is really the country that I love. No one believed me, Mike. No one. They say I never kept not a single promise, they say that after all these scandals, My political adventure is coming to an end. Do you think that is true? I would not know, Silvio. I do not follow politics much. Once, in a shelter, when I was skiing, One lady asked me: "Bongiorno" "Who are you really?" It left me speechless. Because I did not know it. Do you know the diference between you and me, Mike? It is that you here have only memories. I have projects. You know the work I've done, Mike. Submit questionnaires forever. If we think about it, It's a little stupid, is not it? - How? - You can stay here. Thanks, Silvio, but Daniela It is calmer if I go back to Milan tonight. All right. The next time you come, we activate the volcano. In Italy, millions of mattresses of quality... the parents have left... Giorgia, 32 years old... See you? It's new and even more complete! Thousands of euros. Goes up. Climb gently. (A) Yes. Gently. Going down. Go up again. Goes up. Climb the rope a little more. Keep going up Here it is. It's coming. The descent begins. Low. Go down like this. Perfect. Let's hold it. Comes down. Descend, slowly. Slowly. Go down. Gently, slowly. He is about to support himself. He is about to support himself. He is supported. Perfect.
