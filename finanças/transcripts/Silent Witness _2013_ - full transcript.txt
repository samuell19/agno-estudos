Good morning ladies and gentlemen, it's Sunday the 28th of May. We're outside the City Intermediate People's Court to report to you live the case of suspected murder by Lin Mengmeng - daughter of famous entrepreneur Lin Tai - of her father's girlfriend: The famous singer Yang Dan. The case will commence hearing here at 9 am. The public has been specially interested in this case of 'rich daughter murders stepmum' from the start. It's therefore attracted a frenzy of media reports everywhere. Why would a 20-year old girl want to murder her star stepmum-to-be? Are there any hidden secrets behind this whole incident? Cut to Camera 2, the Procuratorate's car has arrived. Camera 2. Public Prosecutor Tong Tao's in charge of this case. He's also the bright young star of the Procuratorate, having nailed many big and puzzling cases in recent years. Attention to the left, the legal team's here. A-listed Defence Counsel Zhou Li is famous all over China, and also one of the most expensive. Of course, however expensive should not be a problem for our Defendant. Attention! Mr Lin's here. The reason this case's been such a sensation is not just because the victim is a famous singer. More importantly is the other person caught between the accused and the victim - the famous and legendary local financial entrepreneur Lin Tai. Close-up! Close-up! Apart from being the accused's father, he's also the victim's boyfriend. One wonders what's going through his mind right now. Is he feeling sad for his dead girlfriend, or is he worrying for his accused daughter? Mr Lin how are you? Can you please tell us why your daughter's murdered Yang Dan? Was it because their relationship's already degenerated to an intolerable state? My daughter hasn't murdered anyone. But the Procuratorate's already got evidence and witnesses. How can you explain that? Don't believe their judgment lightly, nor take those so-called evidence too seriously. I repeat: My daughter hasn't murdered anyone. If not murder, was it suicide then? The hearing's about to begin. Please just wait and see, ok? If Yang Dan and Mengmeng both fall into a well at the same time, who'd you save first? Laugh... This kind of question is serious jeopardy to 'social harmony'! Director, ten minutes before the hearing starts. Let's start recording. OK, let's get started! Though the whole city's focused on the victim Yang Dan, right now we should rather focus on mogul Lin Tai, who's the starting point of the whole incident. Go Camera 2. Here comes the Procuratorate's team. Cut in! Tong Tao's always been in charge of major cases. When he graduated from law school in 1997 and joined the Procuratorate, his first target of investigation was actually Lin Tai. Director, I bet Prosecutor. Tong would rather have Lin Tai be the accused. But it works this way too - father's debts, daughter pays. Laugh... The father of the accused has hired the most expensive lawyer obviously in order to seek as much pardon for his daughter as possible. But with such solid evidence now what can she possibly do? The Defendant Lin Mengmeng. Female. 20 years old. Third year student at Art College. Such a beautiful young girl is now suspected of murder and standing trial in this court. Since her mother died of illness six years ago, her mogul father's become the most desirable target of many single women in the society. But Lin Tai was never moved until he met the beautiful singer Yang Dan seventeen months ago and fell in love. Three days before the murder, news of a one-night-stand between Yang Dan and some actor broke on the internet. Immediately they became the centre of attention. Teacher Li, So has the hearing started? While everyone was waiting for Lin's reaction, the princess got more anxious than the emperor! Lin Mengmeng sought out Yang Dan in a rage. And a quarrel escalated into murder. Hey, can you guess... if she said her father was Lin Tai when she was arrested? Laugh... Director, the judges are about to enter. - It's time. Camera One. - Inside the court room. Live coverage shall finish now. We'll give a special report on the trial's details during prime time tonight. The trial's about to begin. All cameras stand by. Court stands. At around 8:50 pm on the 25th of March, the Defendant Lin Mengmeng drove her red Cayenne into the underground carpark of Hai Wai Building to look for the victim Yang Dan... So you're Yang Dan's driver? Hm. I hear you've been with Lin Tai for a long time and it was he who assigned you to be Yang Dan's chauffeur. It appears you were the eye-witness at the scene, and you called the police. Can I ask you a question? Yang Dan was supposed to be having affairs with actors and rich men. Were those news true or false? I don't know. How can you not know? Because I'm only in charge of driving, not bedrooms. Defendant Lin Mengmeng, did you drive your red Cayenne to the crime scene on the night of the crime? "Surveillance video at the crime scene." Yes, yes I did. After parking the car, did you rendezvous with the victim Yang Dan? Yes. And then you led her into your car? Yes. When your car just got started again, she got out, pointed and yelled at you. Yes. And then you hit her with your car? I had had too much to drink at the time, my mind was already not clear. Indeed you had been drinking, but your mind must have been clear. Otherwise how could you have reverse parked, and sped up to hit someone so clearly? Defence Counsel, do you have any questions? No question. The victim Yang Dan's chest and limbs were struck by a powerful force. But the fatal blow is this iron nail. Defendant, any objection? I only know I did hit her with the car, but I never knew about the nail, I really didn't know about the nail. Defence Counsel, do you have any objection? Defence Counsel, do you have any objection? No objection. I'd like to ask you another question. Just chatting, so please don't mind. Since you're Lin Tai's long-time employee, you must have a close relationship with his family. So didn't you feel a bit torn in your heart when you called the police? Calling prosecution witness Zhao Jun please. Stay seated, I'll go ahead. On the night of the crime at 8:15 pm. I saw the Defendant Lin Mengmeng at a bar and heard her declare that she was going to kill Yang Dan. I'll make her disappear completely in front of my father! But Yang Dan's not easy to deal with. Then I'll kill her! Mengmeng! Mengmeng! Kill Who? That's how she maliciously wounded and thereby caused Yang Dan's death. Defendant Lin Mengmeng, any objections against this charge? I, I don't object. Defence Counsel, any objection? No objection. She's just a cheap fake! Laugh... Sflence. Please don't talk amongst yourselves. The Public Prosecutor has already explained what causes the victim's death. Any question from the Defence Counsel? Any question from the Defence Counsel? Yes. The Chief Justice and the Collegial Bench, what's the subject matter of today's hearing? The murder case of the accused Lin Mengmeng. But the evidence provided by the Public Prosecutor has only concerned certain disputes between two women, with nothing to do with death. It's the car hit that causes the death. The Chief Justice and the Collegial Bench, I call my Witness No. 4. He shall tell us how the victim died. At 8:45pm that night, I accompanied the victim Yang Dan to Hai Wai Building to participate in a concert discussion. What exactly are you trying to say? From what I heard, she seemed to be meeting someone familiar. Crazy! I didn't pay much attention. I need to go to the underground carpark. I'll go with you. It's not necessary. I'll be back in five minutes. When she didn't return after more than ten minutes I decided to go down and look for her. Did you see who the murderer was then? No. I just saw the back of a red SUV flash by when I went down. Miss Yang! Given your relationship with the Lin family, if you had seen clearly who the murderer was, would you have called the police? I suppose not. Defence Counsel, any questions regarding this evidence? Defence Counsel, any questions? Yes. Attention, attention! Get a closeup! You've been Lin Tai's chauffeur for 15 years. What's your impression of him? Mr Lin is my boss. He's always looked after me well. How long have you been Yang Dan's chauffeur? Over a year or so. Who paid your salary? Of course Mr Lin. How do you evaluate the victim who's a famous singer? Her songs are very popular. That's a matter for her fans. Did you like her? I'm also her fan. Did she respect you? It's OK. Lying! She's never respected you, that's why you've always hated her. But she's your boss's woman, that's why you could never show your anger. Really? On what basis are you saying that? Objection! Subjective speculation by the Defence Counsel! Defence Counsel, please show your evidence. My evidence is: On the 2nd of October on your 37th birthday one of the wishes you made in front of your family, was that Yang Dan be killed by a car. Is that correct? Yes or no? Want me to call the witness? Yes. She, she sometimes didn't speak to me with much respect. Some insulting remarks I guess. That's why you hated her. Yes. You said earlier you were very grateful to Lin Tai. Yes. Still grateful even now? - Yes. - Lying again! You're only grateful on the surface. In fact you hate him, you hate his guts! What are you saying? I spoke very clearly. Mr Lin is my boss. He's my bread and butter. Why would I hate him? Because of your wife. Because she's been going to bed with him, and you've always known! Objection! That's insulting my witness. Not insulting. Just to ascertain if he's lying. Please answer. Why would you be grateful to a man who's slept with your wife? You said he's always looked after you well. So does that mean he's looked after your wife well also? Sflence. Please keep quiet. You have a legally wedded wife, and a four-year old daughter. If you're still a man with some dignity then please answer me truthfully: Faced with Lin Tai's insult, did you hate him? I don't want to answer. Don't want or don't dare? So you don't even have the courage to hate a man who's taken your wife? Yes, I hated him. Is that alright now? Chief Justice, I object to the Defence Counsel's irrelevant questions. Alright, we'll then move on to questions relevant to this case. How many SUVs are there in Lin Tai's house? How many SUVs are there in Lin Tai's house? Two. That's correct. One is a BMW X5, and the other a Porsche Cayenne. Please tell me if they sound any differently when started? Yes. As a veteran chauffeur with 15 years experience, you can fully tell the car's make from the engine's noise. Given the site conditions, it would take Lin Mengmeng's car 20 seconds to drive from the crime scene to the exit. When you came out of the lift into the carpart, you must have at least heard for 20 seconds even though you might not have seen anything. That's why you must have known the car in question was Lin Mengmeng's Cayenne. Why would I want to hide that then? Because you wanted revenge, against a man who's been sleeping with your wife for a long time - Lin Tai. You know the most precious thing in his life is his daughter. To have her go to jail is like killing him. This way you can avenge his taking your wife, right? Yes, I wanted to take revenge on this rich bastard! I wanted him to wish he were dead! Defence Counsel, this trial is for the murder case of the accused. Even if you can prove that witness. Sun Wei called the police after knowing who the murderer was, it'll still not affect the verdict. Chief Justice, I haven't finished my cross-examination yet. After you reached the crime scene and saw Yang Dan on the ground, what did you do? I went over, and shook her shoulders. She didn't... react. - After that? - After that I shook her head. Wait a minute. How did you feel? What did I feel? Lin Tai's been playing with your wife for a long time. Now you were faced with Lin Tai's woman who's unconscious. How did you feel? I won't let you talk about this matter! I won't let you! I don't have to, but you must answer me. How did you feel? OK, OK. How did I feel? I, I was happy, delighted. I was very happy, now are you satisfied? Apart from that what else did you gain? Gain? When you got close to this unconscious singer, what did you take from her? You took what didn't belong to you - the Patek Philippe watch on her hand that's worth 3 million yuans. Let me tell you a secret, female stars never leave home without their jewels. That's why I believe, right now, this watch is hidden in your home, correct? A theft of 3 million, will land you over 15 years in jail. That's why, no matter what happens today, you already won't be able to walk out of this court. The Chief Justice, my witness is now in a state of psychological breakdown. Please suspend the cross-examination. Overruled. You got close to Yang Dan, and shook her head to check her injuries, correct? This is the court, you must answer my question. Yes. And then you saw that she was half-conscious. Miss Yang. Yes. And then you saw a protruding nail behind her head. And then you grabbed her head and banged it against that nail, right? Yes. No, that's not right. Objection! Defence Counsel's taking advantage of my witness's verbal slip. Objection overruled. You killed Lin Tai's woman. His daughter's the scapegoat. Plus the 3 million yuan watch that Lin Tai paid for. Congratulations, you've thoroughly had your revenge against him. Please look at my client. If you still have a little conscience, then please don't destroy a young girl's life. Because she's also raised by parents, just like your daughter. Admit it. Even though you'll lose freedom, but from now on you'll have gained a man's dignity. Yes, it's I who killed Yang Dan. Bastard! No pictures! No pictures! Good morning ladies and gentlemen, it's Sunday the 28th of May. We're outside the City Intermediate People's Court to report to you live the case the case of suspected murder by Lin Mengmeng - daughter of famous entrepreneur Lin Tai - of her father's girlfriend: The famous singer Yang Dan. The case will commence hearing here at 9 am. Tong Tao has always been in charge of major cases. When he graduated from law school in 1997 and joined the Procuratorate, his first target of investigation was actually Lin Tai. Tong has tried to prosecute Lin three times over the course of 15 years, but has failed each time due to lack of evidence. I tried to prosecute him a second time the next year, again for commercial fraud. But the plaintiff suddenly withdrew his claim. The third time was for financial deception. On the first day of the trial a witness overturned his evidence. When that fails a scapegoat then emerged the next day. But it's a criminal case this time, would anyone still be his scapegoat? There're no deals that can't be made, only prices that can't be negotiated. I understand Zhou Li. First, she's good at logical rebuttal. Second, clever with swapping concepts. A boss who dares to play foul, together with a lawyer who's good at turning things around - what sort of chemical reaction will result? To make what's false look real in court. That night I was responsible for keeping watch of the surveillance video. Chief Justice... Defence Counsel. No objection. I arrested the suspect Lin Mengmeng immediately. Defence Counsel. No objection. I saw Lin Mengmeng declare she was going to kill Yang Dan. I don't object. Defence Counsel. No objection, no objection, no objection. I call my Witness No. 4. He shall tell us how the victim died. Though Sun Wei is our strongest proof, he's also our biggest uncertainty. He's been with Lin Tai for fifteen years, that proves it's possible for him to be bought.. If he's been bought, what's he most likely going to do? Overturn his evidence in court. Because your wife's been going to bed with him, and you've always known! Yes, I hated him. And then you grabbed her head and banged it against that nail, right? Yes. Bastard! Excuse me please, Mr Lin has to assist the Police with a statement. Has Lin Tai been arrested please? No, just need to verify his statement. Then we're entitlted to some interviews. The results today are really unexpected. Please tell us your thoughts, Mr Lin. I told you right here 4 hours ago that my daughter has not killed anyone. How did you predict that? That wasn't prediction. It's confidence, a father's confidence. What did you think of the hearing today? Very unexpected. What's unexpected? Never thought of it. Never thought of what? Never thought the murderer was in fact Sun Wei. Who told you the murderer was Sun Wei? I kept looking at Lin Tai's eyes in court. He was as cunning and creepy as usual. All that stuff about the cheating wife and a husband's dignity - a perfect story acted out in all likeness. But in my eyes, that was just a show. Let's go. Prosecutor Tong, where are we going? To dig up everything on this bastard. Since he's playing smart, I'll have to be even smarter! When someone's going to die anyway, he might as well get some money for it. No one would die for Lin Tai for nothing. He's Lin Tai, not Bin Laden. An extremely dramatic scene was played out in court today at around noon, when prosecution witness Sun Wei's disguise was ripped apart under the brilliant scrutiny of the Defence Counsel. It turns out the accuser is actually the accused - he's the murderer of Yang Dan. Well, so like minds really think alike! Have they rushed here so quickly in order to swap evidence? Magic. Not only will they conjure up what's fake, they'll even bring back what's real. Go check the bank accounts of Sun Wei and his immediate family to see if there's been any huge transfers. There's no contract for this type of deal. It has to be cashed on spot. Find out if Sun Wei's been involved with any kind of gambling or black market investment. When one's owed too much money to repay the only thing he can sell then is his life. A call from Xiaowu. He said Sun Wei and his wife Su Hong are being investigated at the police station right now. We can join in tomorrow morning. Prosecutor Tong, a breakthrough! What is it? Sun Wei's got cancer. Brain cancer, mid-term, diagnosed two and a half months ago. Two and half months ago, that's half a month before the crime. If the crime had occurred ten days later, Sun Wei would no longer have been Yang Dan's driver. So we can deduce that. Lin Tai must have bought Sun Wei, a dying man, after Lin Mengmeng's arrest. No problem logically, but we must find the deal money. Da Liu's team is already conducting a blanket search. Prosecutor Tong, the police just called. We can interrogate them now. What should I tell you? Why slept with him? Or the details in bed? Just start with the reason. Who would refuse a handsome man who's also willing to spend money on you? We already know you're a cancer patient. I know what you're thinking. Prosecutor Tong, we've found the money. 2 million, transferred from Lin Tai's personal account to Sun Wei. Wonderful, basic evidence solved. But, the transfer was made not after the crime, but 4 days before. 8 days after being diagnosed, Lin gave 2 million to Sun Wei as a personal gift to his family. Four days later Mengmeng killed somebody. Sun called the police without having seen her. So he took the blame to redeem himself. I was willing to go to bed with him and be his lover because I could make money out of it. Do you think you can fool everyone just by keeping quiet? It seems the couple's not doing it for money. It's for gratitude. Since the day of the crime, they've already planned all the counter-measures, including this very moment. You're wrong. Lin Tai paid him 2 million, not because of his 15 years' service, but because of my tenderness. I understand you well. Someone who's going to die soon might as well give his life to the boss. Wrong again. Precisely because he's got cancer and could no longer enjoy the money I had earned, he also didn't need to tolerate it any more. Don't expect them to confess, because we can't prove anything. As to how many times we did it every night and in what positions, just keep investigating. Let's gather and go through the details at the crime scene again. Do we need Lin's statement today? Not necessary until we've found new evidence. They all say I won't be seeing father again. Is that true? Has something happened to dad? If there're no other complications, my daughter will be acquitted and released in two days. I want to donate 20 more 'Schools of Hope' to "Project Hope". I want my own experience to become a good lesson for all the single parents who're trying to educate their kids. To sum up, thank you all very much for coming. Thanks also for your support. Thank you. Have you tipped them? Everyone. What hard work! Organising interviews everywhere like a star. Well, I'm only... Don't give me the crap, I want to talk a little truth. Murder must be repaid by life, but only by the killer. Prosecutor Tong, I think you've really misunderstood. You can't trade in someone else's life just because you have money. Others have parents too, no matter if they're rich or poor. The hearing starts tomorrow. Have you got any evidence? This is the truth I want to talk about. Regardless of the outcome tomorrow, I'll never give up. Even if I have to go to the ends of the world or carry on till I retire, I must convict the real murderer. Mark my word! Prosecutor Tong. I beg of you, please let us off. What did you say? I didn't hear. Name a price. You're scared. Finally you're not acting any more. Tell me, what offer can you make. You... The offer's yours. I won't say no. You've got the nerve! Daring to bribe me in public at 4 pm in broad daylight. But Lin, I haven't finished yet. As soon as Mengmeng's convicted, you'll also be tried for fabricating false evidence. "The People's Procuratorate of Fengzhou City." Due to the unexpected outcome at the last hearing, Lin Tai - the father of the accused - has been summoned to give evidence in court tomorrow. He shall give a statement on the new turn of events.. Prosecutor Tong, something's come up. What is it? Someone with an alias of 'Firefly' has just sent us an email which reads: Dear Public Prosecution team, I've been following Yang Dan's case for the past 2 months. I was also in court during the hearing. I want to tell you a secret - when the crime was committed I happened to be there. And I've recorded everything on my phone. Do you need it? Can we locate the other party's IP address? It'll take time. Can this be real? Better believe it's real. Reply immediately that we need it. Qiangzi, go find the party's IP address. OK! How is it? Has the person replied yet? He's using some undulation login technique, so we can't locate him. Don't think about this evidence any more. What we need now is faith. Even if Lin Mengmeng's acquitted, we must still never give up on this case. Hey, the other side's just replied. Lin Tai's very powerful. I don't dare to give evidence in court. After a night's consideration, I've decided to tell you the truth. Sun Wei is not the murderer. That's it? That's it. We need the video recording of the crime scene. OK, I'll reply. It'll take me about half an hour to send you the video. It's just over half an hour now before the court session. Start right away. After three days' adjournment, hearing will commence again this morning at 9 am. Lin Tai, father of the accused Lin Mengmeng, is scheduled to give evidence. How come Teacher Li's still not here? She's still in class at college, probably won't make it. If there's evidence in the video that Lin Mengmeng's the murderer, then we'll submit it to court immediately and apply for another adjournment. OK. We can see that Lin Tai, the father of the accused, has already arrived. Why hasn't it arrived? Don't worry, don't worry. It's here. Mr Lin, if Lin Mengmeng can be acquitted and released today, We hope you'll agree to be interviewed by us again. That's not important. The important thing is that Mengmeng's safe. Don't you think? I'll download it now. How long will it take? That depends on the size. It's done. What is it now? It won't play. Let me see, I'll download another video player programme. But, it's already time for the hearing. Mengmeng... Mengmeng... Mengmeng don't cry. OK, it's done. Now let me play the video with this programme. The hearing's about to begin, please enter the courtroom. OK. Here's the image. That's the underground carpark of Hai Wai Building. It seems the witness was waiting for someone in his car. So what if your Lin family has money? Who're you going to scare? What haven't I, Yang Dan, seen before? This witness must have wanted to record Yang Dan on his phone, so he could blog about it. What's happened? What is it again? It's stuck again. Don't worry, don't worry. Court session's about to begin. Public Prosecution team please enter. I know. We'll go straight away. The Chief Justice asked me to... Yes we know! It's Lin Tai. How can it be him? Oh dear, it's stuck again. The whole courtroom is waiting for you. What are you trying to do? Continue the download. Next, defence witness Lin Tai, who's father of the accused Lin Mengmeng, shall give evidence in court. He shall prove what kind of relationship is there between the accused Lin Mengmeng and the victim Yang Dan. In my recollection, my daughter Lin Mengmeng and Yang Dan were able to get along quite well. Mengmeng's also told me more than once that she liked Yang Dan's singing very much. Let's all think about that. Prosecutor Tong, hurry and look. With a 20 year old girl, no matter how much she hates someone, I believe at most she'd just let loose some steam and complain to daddy. One is my girlfriend, and the other is my darling daughter. He's worse than an animal! I love them both deeply. - Prosecutor, what should we do? - I firmly don't believe they'd fight life and death with each other. Submit the evidence immediately - —and ask for a retrial. - I'd never believe... Investigate Lin Tai as quickly as possible. Sorry...|'m being a bit emotional. "Infected file. Please delete immediately." Luckily, we met this brilliant counsel here - Ms Zhou - who's rescued my daughter from death. "File deleted automatically." Thank you Ms Zhou. Thank you. And I thank the Court for being fair. I've finished. Public Prosecutor, (an)' Opposition? At the time of the crime, that is when your daughter was hitting Yang Dan with her car, where were you? Me? I was at home. Chief Justice, The Collegial Panel, I apply for a 10 minutes recess. Why? I admit this is an unusual request. But I have some important information that needs to be re-organised. Alright then. He killed his own girlfriend, then got his daughter to take the blame. What a bastard! Calm down. Cursing's not going to solve any problem now. We can't let Lin Tai leave the courtroom today, like tigers back to the mountains yet again. But our only evidence now is no longer working! He's very cold-blooded, very cunning and very rich. But he's got a weakness - very proud. Pride is often harmful. You... what do you want to do? I want to give it a try. Chief Justice, The Collegial Panel, Yang Dan's death happened after a dispute over a scandal. That's why I must ask the defence witness some questions about the scandal. Approved. You're running a company with 2000 employees by yourself, and is worth over 20 billion yuans. You're definitely a successful man. Thank you. How long have you known the victim Yang Dan? About four years. Did you love her? Yes I did. Did she love you? Yes. So, how did you see the scandal that broke out a few days before the murder. Don't you remember? Well... just a publicity stint. But more then ten media outlets reported this incident simultaneously, together with clear video images. What do you really want to ask? I want to know how you felt about the scandal. The Chief Justice, I refuse to answer. I feel this is irrelevant to the case. Public Prosecutor, please pay attention to the words you use and the way you ask questions. But the witness must submit to cross-examination. As a successful man, lots of single women everywhere must have been after you since your wife passed away 6 years ago. There were many even before my wife passed away. Then who have you ever pursued yourself? In my recollection women have always pursued me. What about Yang Dan? The same. Did you love Yang Dan? What is love? Did you think about marrying her? Think or not think, that's really a question worth pondering. You've given her expensive homes, jewellery and watches. You've really spent a lot on her. You've just said that I'm a successful businessman. I understand clearly that beauty is for consumption. Well, this is something you probably still don't understand well. But 15 days before the murder, you proposed to Yang Dan and gave her a diamond ring worth 1.3 million as a present. Yes or no? I've given diamond rings to four women over the last six years. But two words were engraved on the ring: Tai Dan. It shows you were deeply in love with her. If I knew it'd cause so much trouble I'd have written "Socialism is good". OK, I admit, I did consider getting married at some particular instant. Alright? This woman that you wanted to marry, did she love you? Yes. If she did, then why was she repeatedly involved in scandals with other men? You're stuck on this question again. - Chief Justice! - Chief Justice, do you know how the media is seeing this case? A cuckold leading to a murder. That's why I should cross-examine clearly. Sflence. You can continue, but you must watch your words. Let's continue with the topic on how Yang cheated. Please stick with those responsible topics. Right now, over a billion people in China are probably focusing on this hearing via the internet. Of course I'll be responsible for my questions. It's often a huge insult to a man when he's been cuckolded. How did you deal with such a betrayal? She betrayed me? - She dared? - So according to your rational, even after the famous Pan Jinlian's seduced Xi Menqing, she also didn't mean to betray Wu Dalang? Just two days before her murder, why would she offer herself to a married man who's got no money and no influence? I'm warning you, - Stop this topic! - Let me tell you the reason. When someone's been hungry for a long time one will have to go eat somewhere else. It can't be helped. It's just a fact. Mr Lin, why have you been tolerating this kind of insult? No one dares insult me. But who cuckolded you then? You've got it wrong. I haven't been cuckolded. We had already separated at the time. - I... - Lying. If that's true, then why did your daughter go to Yang Dan? That's her matter. It's because she couldn't stand her father being a coward. Me a coward... You said I'm a coward? But Yang Dan insulted you again in front of Mengmeng. She was insulting herself. At the scene of the crime, Yang Dan was clearly pointing at your nose and yelling - 'What if I didn't want to be Mrs Lin!' Excuse me let me tell you, that's because I had slapped her twice in the car. But she continued to insult you after getting out of the car. That's why I hit her with the car, I wanted to crush her into a pulp, understand? Not to kill her with a nail, but to crush her into a pulp. Even hitting her 100 times was not enough. Aren't you supposed to be fair? Hey, Chief Justice, isn't that fair? Chief Justice, The Collegial Panel, he, is the real murderer in this case. What? Dad, don't speak like that. Judge, it wasn't like that. Uncle Tong, - it wasn't like that. - Damn it! I'll die behind the Dragon Back Wall. It wasn't like that. It wasn't like that. - Let me go. - Get back, - —calm down. - I'll die by your hands! Good morning ladies and gentlemen, it's Sunday the 28th of May. We're outside the City Intermediate People's Court to report to you live the case the case of suspected murder by Lin Mengmeng - daughter of famous entrepreneur Lin Tai - of her father's girlfriend: The famous singer Yang Dan. The case will commence hearing here at 9 am. With Mengmeng's actions, the death penalty can be avoided, but a 15 years sentence is unavoidable. Forget 15 years, not even a day! What I want is acquittal and release! Don't mention 15 years anymore! Alright? Impossible. It's possible, possible. |'m sorry! Zhou Li, you've created miracles before, it'll be the same this time! Tell me you can create miracles, OK? We have to respect reality. Let me tell you what reality is, Zhou Li, A 20 year old girl has to spend 15 years in jail, all the best years of her life in jail. That's the reality. That's why I need your miracle, you have to create a miracle for me! You can do it. Tell me? OK? It's impossible - Please, everybody - We can't defend passively, we must make use of her two advantages - First, she' only 20, she's still a child! Second, she's from a single parent family without a mum. Sensationalised tactics?! Once the hearing starts we have to push with every step. Whatever the Procuratorate comes up with, we must rebut immediately, giving them no chance to elaborate! I'll fire off first to rebut their rationality aspect; Li Jie should follow to supplement my logic! OK You're responsible for the last and most crucial aspect - sensationalism! After two sentences I'll start to tear up, and try to cry out loud once I reach he middle. Yours tears are not important. What's important is to make the entire audience tear up! Hello? Hi, Barrister Zhou. Hi! Let's cut it short. I want to make an important deal with you! What kind of deal do you want to make with me? As long as Lin Mengmeng can be acquitted, Mr Lin will give you an additional bonus of 10 million yuans. Am I correct? What are you trying to say? I'd like to exchange some evidence I have that can acquit. Lin Mengmeng with you. You have evidence that can prove her innocence? Yes! Is that a deal? Can I see the evidence? We haven't talked about the price yet! Go ahead. I just want a million! This million can get Lin Mengmeng acquitted! If that's really the case, then you should go to Lin Tai! The one I want to go to now is you! When can I see the evidence? Once you're inside the courtroom. Why should I believe you? The court will help you verify it. How do you want to deal? You can pay me when the real murderer surfaces. Let's get out! I have a feeling, this is not entirely groundless. Otherwise she wouldn't deliver before getting paid. But she still hasn't provided any evidence so far? Hello? Barrister, go inside the courtroom quickly, you'll get the goods in 5 minutes. "Unknown caller." Hello? Understand "Hatred from losing one's wife"? Yes. And "Murdering with a borrowed knife"? Yes! Alright, just check your MMS! I want to change the court tactics! Court stands! Approximately 10 minutes later, the Cayenne started... Defence Counsel? No objection. But the fatal blow is this iron nail... No objection. | clearly saw everything that happened. No objection. Yes! Because your wife's been going to bed with him, and you've always known! And then you grabbed her head and banged it against that nail, right? Yes... Bastard! No pictures! No pictures! "Unknown caller." Hello! It's now time for you to pay! I'll wait for you at the Jiuyi Street junction. I'll go with you. Wait for me in the car. Thank you! You're welcome. Why did you only say it today?! I also only just made the decision this morning. Why didn't you go to Lin Tai direct? Lin Tai's already spent a lot of money on me. Don't want him to spend any more! Now that Yang Dan's dead, and your husband's also done, do you want to marry Lin Tai? Let nature run its course! But I believe after this. Lin Tai will surely be grateful of me! I admire your standards in choosing men! You would make the same choice if our positions were reversed! Excuse me, are you Su Hong? Hm, Sun Wei's wife. Please come with us to the police station, we need to verify a few things with you. OK. See you later. Come, let's celebrate... Celebrate what? Finding the real murderer... Also you've won another case that's simply impossible to win, right? I have a sudden feeling, what if Sun Wei was just acting? Two months ago when I first met Lin Tai, I already sensed there were too many plots in those eyes! Today in court, I didn't see any joy and surprise in those eyes, but rather the calm from premeditated scheming. Goodbye. Thank you. Mr Lin, can we interview you now? OK, right away. Just a moment. Hi Barrister Zhou, thank you. I don't want to talk about that! Oh, about the bonus? It's too late tonight. Tomorrow first thing I'll send you 5 million, and the rest after Mengmeng's release. I'd like to know Sun Wei's price! What Sun Wei's price?! The show you paid for, he acted in, and I responded to! Forgotten already so quickly?! An outcome of life and death, who would dare act... I must know Sun Wei's price! Then let me tell you, HO pf ice'.! Let's go one step ahead - Expose Sun Wei first, then Lin Tai. Under normal circumstances life's more important than money, with one exception - he's about to die, With this type of deal, payment must arrive first. I'm convinced the money must already be on his account. No doubt, we're racing against the Procuratorate. Same direction, same course. Zhou Li's finding is correct, Sun Wei's really got cancer! Fine acting! Lin Tai's already told me everything last night. I really admire your courage! It's OK. Li, I've found the transfer, but the timing's not right! Looks like we have to change our tactics! You're indeed very beautiful! If I were Lin Tai I'd really have had an affair with you. What are you saying? It's OK. Just stop acting. What's the next step? Go find Lin Tai, this bastard should pay me my bonus now! Wait for me in the car! The remaining 5 million. I won't be accepting jobs from you in future. The price is not bad, but too dangerous! I bumped into Tong Tao on my way in. I saw a danger signal in his eyes! This guy already wanted to get me over ten years ago, but up till now he still hasn't been able to do so... One needs concrete evidence, to convict someone like me. But where's the evidence? Yes! Sometimes, time can solve all problems. That's something between him and me. It's got nothing to do, with you now, nor in future! That's good then. Thank you. I'm off. We've got something! An anonymous person's sent me an email, saying he was at the crime scene at the time, and had recorded everything with his mobile. He's got a video at the location? He wants a deal? Two million! How to tell if it's real? He said he'd send the first half to us first. After we're sure he'll send the second half. Here it is. So what if your Lin family has money? Who're you going to scare? What haven't I, Yang Dan, seen before? Looks like this is the first half of the video. Li, I've done micro comparisons, both the surroundings and décor are exactly the same, I'm quite certain this is the crime scene! Can we find out who shot this? Impossible, so much traffic in the carpark everyday, even the police can't find it. The video should be real, continue to negotiate with them! The other side wants 500,000 downpayment, then exchange on site! Why didn't he go and deal with Lin Tai? Remit funds! You must pay attention to safety. I was a scout in the military before, so relax! Let's go! Let's go. Li, videos and sound, unlike fingerprints and murder weapons, aren't concrete evidence! You think we really need to do this? We're here. This is where they've specified. Be careful, must pay attention to safety. Bitch! You dared scold me! Dad, dad, dad, don't hit her anymore, dad, dad! Go back! Hello! I finally understand why the other party's not dealing with Lin Tai! Remit funds! Prosecutor Tong, something's up! The Procuratorate's got the first email! Li... how should I put it? No lawyer from any country in the world is supposed to do what's bad for his client! Since I'm not Lin Tai's accomplice, I must have some proof, right? From today on this computer will be sealed. When will it be opened again? When Tong Tao investigates me for fabricating evidence in future! Be rest assured, I'm a business person, I won't be clouded by emotions... You were already clouded by emotions when - you paid 2 million for it! - I was buying a bargaining chip! Even if I send it to Tong Tao, I'll still put a parrot virus inside so the file will disappear in 10 minutes. I submit to all your decisions, but may I ask you to please wait a little, send the file over just before the hearing? As for Lin Tai... no matter how disgusted you're with him, he's still our client. He's our boss, - We're lawyers. - Don't mention this bastard anymore, he's not entitled to be anyone's father! Just a moment please. Why are you here? The hearing's about to start, what are you doing here? I've got a question. It's been bugging me. What question? Is Sun Wei really the murderer? Of course, without a doubt! If the Procuratorate's got evidence to the contrary, what should I do? Impossible. Mengmeng, I want to know, on the night of the crime, who was it that really hit and killed Yang Dan? I want to hear the truth! Tell Li Jie: Send the video to Tong Tao immediately! Real murderer found! Mengmeng's innocent! Real murderer found! Mengmeng's innocent! _|\/|engmeng _|\/|engmeng. Yang Dan was clearly pointing at your nose and yelling - "What if I didn't want to be Mrs Lin!" Excuse me let me tell you, that's because I had slapped her twice in the car. But she continued to insult you after getting out of the car. Li. Mengmeng, on the night of the crime, who was it that really hit and killed Yang Dan? It was me. Was it you? It was me. That's why I hit her with the car, I wanted to crush her into a pulp. Dad, it wasn't like that, it wasn't like that, Let me go! - We'll be going then. - Alright, goodbye, Barrister Zhou, congratulations! In fact you were defending Lin Mengmeng. Now that she's been acquitted, it already shows you've succeeded. A big truck has collided with a mini passenger bus on the inter-province highway. 32 people have been injured so far, Don't worry about me, just take good care of yourself. Some have already been sent to the hospital for treatment. During this process rescue workers have also been repairing vehicles "and helping the injured." "Let's look at the next story." According to our reporters, the sensational case a while ago in which rich businessman. Lin Tai was suspected of murdering his girlfriend Yang Dan, will be heard in court at 9 am tomorrow morning. Though the case hasn't been concluded yet, Finally he's been brought under justice! Hot discussions and debates have never stopped. People have never stopped condemning Lin Tai as well. Would someone like him, Some civilians have started the allow himself to be caught without a fight? 'Whether fatherly love for the rich are...' But... what other tricks can he come up with? That's exactly what I'm thinking about! "Inside information: The Procuratorate stated they had received a mysterious video during the last hearing, thereby confirming their suspicion of Lin Tai. Of course, the trial of Lin Tai has not yet started. All charges shall await the court's decision. I'll die behind the Dragon Back Wall, I'll die in your hands. This statement has nothing to do with what was going on at the time. What exactly does it mean?! Did he He yelled out such gibberish because he's lost control? What does it mean by Dragon Back Wall? Check if Lin Tai's paid any renovation companies these last few months? Check and see if Lin Tai's bought a lot of second hand cars lately? Where was the renovated location? What... Su Province? "Su Province." Can you tell me the precise location? Ladies and gentlemen, good morning! It's Tuesday the 20th of July. The case in which mogul Lin Tai is suspected of murdering... his famous singer girlfriend Yang Dan, will be heard here in court at 9 am. This is a perplexing case. After a father's murdered his girlfriend, he tried to have his daughter take the blame... I see it, 'Red Star Machinery Factory', right? Anybody here? The hearing commences! So what if your Lin family has money? Who're you going to scare? What haven't I, Yang Dan, seen before? Defendant Lin Tai, on the 25th of March this year, when your daughter was taken away by the police as a murder suspect, how did you feel? Dad, Dad, Dad, save me... Dad, Dad... Dad, save me, Dad... Dad... Dad, save me, Dad... Don't touch her! Then what about the chauffeur Sun Wei? I didn't have any idea that it'd be Mengmeng, otherwise how could I have called the police! But be rest assured, We'll salvage the situation. We'll think of a way for sure. Forget it, don't say anymore. Bro' Tai, you've forgotten, I'm a cancer patient. What does it matter if I go to prison or not? I can't tarnish your reputation. Just say no more. Get out! What's reputation compared to life? Get out! I saw Mengmeng grow up. When your wife was dying six years ago, She held my hand and made me promise to look after Mengmeng. Mengmeng's not just yours, She's also our child! I threatened Sun Wei and his wife to fabricate evidence for me! The whole thing was arranged by me alone. Then what about Barrister Zhou Li? Was she involved in fabricating evidence for you?! Never. Having killed a star, she's got the nation's attention! Plus you're dealing with Tong Tao who can't be bribed! You can only rely on me! OK. You set the price. We must mobilize the power of public opinion, And create mass sympathy for Mengmeng! Pay lots of writers to stir up wide-spread discussions on the case with the same theme - Kids with single parents are most pitiful! With this trial, the core of our defence is pardon, the means - sensationalism! Remember, People are always kind-hearted! Support for Mengmeng! I've found the actors - two Hong Kong girls. Their bodies and faces are both very similar to Dan Dan and Mengmeng. We'll just do wide shots and shoot from the side. There should be no problem! High heels, two handbags, sunglasses, wig. Every action, including the angle and speed must be exactly the same! Spread out, everyone in position. Ready! Defendant Lin Tai, during this whole process, has anyone or anything given you undue pressure? One person has given me pressure over the course of over ten years! I'll never give up, even if I have to go to the ends of the world or carry on till I retire. It's precisely because of his existence that I'm standing here today! Action! So what if your Lin family has money? Who're you going to scare? What haven't I, Yang Dan, seen before? Miss Yang! There should be no problem! From here to here. Was it OK? It's done! Looks as though it was totally real! Get another take. Another take? Yes. OK, let's do another take. That's not what I meant. I meant, I'll be the murderer this time! But Why? Another fallback position. I still don't understand, Why bother playing the murderer yourself? I know what kind of person I am in Tong Tao's eyes. That's why he won't believe it's Sun Wei. Would he believe if it's you?! Lin Tai's fingerprints were found on the steering wheel and inside the red Cayenne that hit and killed Yang Dan. Apart from fingerprints, I was also intimate with Yang Dan at dinner time. According to forensic report, Lin Tai's fingerprints were also found on Yang Dan's face and neck that night. What is the truth? If you believe it's the truth, Then it's the truth! How could it be him? He. Is he real murderer in this case. Who's the real murderer? Most people would rather that I be the murderer. All the above details are logically in line. With Lin Tai being the murderer! Send the video with me in it to Zhou Li. We can still try to sort it out! As long as I'm not arrested, there'|| be no peace for Mengmeng, As for Sun Wei, I shouldn't, and couldn't, let his child go through life in self-pity. No. All this is not important, The important thing is for Mengmeng to be safe. Don't you think? Did she love you? Yes. Defendant Lin Tai, Do you have anything else to say apart from this? I want to apologies to the Court, because I've lied here. I'd like to apologies to the Procuratorate, because I've also lied to you. But I hope the Court will give me a chance, in my lifetime, during my last days, to go home one last time, to see my child... I'm just a worldly person. The thing I love most in my life is my daughter. I won't be able to attend her wedding now. But I really hope one day a child'|| be able to take my hand and call me grandpa. I beg you all to please give me a chance. I'm sorry, I did commit the murder, but never told you the truth. I've come here today with a request. What request? To be your defence lawyer! I won't charge a cent! Thank you, but it's not necessary. I already know the inside story. I know you already knew the hidden truth, that I've been hiding all my crimes. I've been to the Red Star Factory in Su Province. Lin Tai, let me defend you! I'll go to court with you and tell the judges the whole truth. Trust me. Everyone is satisfied with the outcome now. In life, there's always something more important than life itself. If it were you, you would have done the same! No, I'm a lawyer. I must be responsible for the truth! You've been fired! I'm your employer. From this minute on, you've been fired! We've been friends after all, give me your blessing! But did you ever think, Mengmeng could become an orphan? At least she's been loved! If I had guessed correctly, Lin Tai must have told you to demolish that place long time ago. But you had kept it there in secret. I was hoping that somehow. Tong Tao would be able to find it. "Happy Birthday to you! Happy Birthday to you!" "Happy Birthday to you! Happy Birthday to you!" "Seven years old." Mum, mum... Sing 'The Shell Trumpet'. Let's sing 'The Shell Trumpet'. Let's sing together, Mum. Look, I've lost my tooth. What was that song? "The shell trumpet blows: 'Di Di Di'." Who told you not to say yes? Why didn't you? Who told you not to keep your promise? "Seventeen years old" I won't go no matter what you say. Mengmeng. So the first jar's to be opened when you go to college. What about the second jar? When do you plan to open it? Well let's wait till I get married! What're you saying? You'll have to get married sooner or later! Look, Mengmeng's blushing. No such thing... Dad. "He traded his life for your freedom." "Not for you to live out a mere existence, but for you to be reborn." How come it's only you two? Where's Prosecutor Tong? What is it? Something's not right! Logically there's nothing wrong with all the evidence against Lin, But... I thought he'd definitely come up. With some tricks and fight to the end. Yet today in court, there was clear conscience and peace in his eyes instead! Perhaps he felt it'd be useless to deny any further... That's not right. It's definitely not right... I must go through everything again before the verdict! I have to settle all my doubts clearly. You two go back first, I need to go somewhwere now... Going right now? Right now! I've already made an error. If I'm slack now I'll be breaching my duty! Prosecutor Tong, let me go with you! No need! He went to Lin Tai's hometown - Su Province. His instincts told him he must start from there, "Su Province" before he could work out Lin Tai's thoughts, including what's been puzzling him for a long time - Dragon Back Wall... The Dragon Back Wall is not a wall but a mountain that's 6O kms from here. Local families love to go hiking and to worship the gods there during the Chongyang and. Mid Autumn Festivals. Is there any story behind it? A legend about fatherly love and redemption. In ancient time the Southern Dragon King was blessed with a son at old age and loved him dearly. But the little prince was spoilt and naughty, and caused trouble everywhere. One day he caused big trouble by setting fire to the shrine in the heavenly palace. In his panic the prince came back home, but the heavenly court was after him. In order to save his son, The king disguised himself as the prince and was punished by bolts of lightning and thunder beneath the Dragon Mountain. That's why I hit her with the car, I wanted to crush her to a pulp, understand? Seeing his father badly burnt from all over and at his last breath, the little prince was tormented by remorse. He rushed out to accept the punishment. Dad, Don't speak like that! Judge, It wasn't like that! In order to silence the little prince, the King threw himself at the Diamond Wall and died immediately. Dad, it wasn't like that! Damn it! I'll die behind the Dragon Back Wall! "It's the father's fault... when the child's not been taught." The Dragon King felt his death was justified. His body then turned into the Dragon Back Mountain. After this disaster, the little prince finally repented his faults, And became a charitable and principled person all his life. Later people renamed the mountain Dragon Back Wall, because this wall had blocked all the little prince's crimes. "Call from Lin Mengmeng." Hello! There's a turn in the case. Apply for a retrial immediately. My heart ached when I saw you in tears in Court, But I also felt pleased and contented. You've finally learnt what loss was, and what remorse meant. Let the bygones be bygone. You've already grown up. You'll be able to face anyone with a forgiving heart. The future you will be a kind, principled person that people shall respect. My darling child, Your father loves you!
