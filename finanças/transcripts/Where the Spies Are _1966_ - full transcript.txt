You must know your enemy. He's ruthless, he's cunning. He comes from a people who for centuries has cultivated the art of confusing, dividing and ruling his opponents. He's backed by an espionage organization with enormous funds. His aim is to destroy you and the enemy is no amateur at his job. 'Now, the first of this film series deals' with the concealed weapon techniques of your enemy. Yes? Speak in English. The enemy is English. If we're to defeat him, we must think with his mind and speak in his language. Excuse me, I wish to know if these techniques have changed much since you are with MI6. Basically, no. We English are conservative and resist progress. 'John Henry Mattock.' 'Cover job, manager of a travel agency' 'in Casablanca.' We English are conservative and resist progress. 'two very interesting items.' 'This watch is a transistor radio.' 'What appeared to be an ordinary Swiss seven jewel alarm' 'was in fact a minute transmitting set.' 'The metallic strap acting as an aerial.' 'The mechanism was pre-tuned and locked on a preset waveband.' 'Every two hours, the watch mechanism sent out a signal' 'automatically to be picked up on VHF' 'and retransmitted by more powerful relay stations.' 'Inscriptions on the back of these watches are used' 'as identifications and are changed every two months.' 'Ronald Parks.' 'Cover job, overseas representative' 'for office equipment firm.' 'You will notice the two pens in this' 'operator's breast pocket.' 'When he was eventually picked up' 'this pen was found to be a compendium' 'of survival and offense.' 'Not exactly an unknown gadget.' 'The British issued them to the French Resistance' 'in the Second World War.' 'But this one had several new ideas.' 'First, an insurance against failure.' 'The "L" or death pill.' 'This pen also contains two small needles.' 'One containing pentothal' 'the truth serum' 'and the other, ejected by using the filling lever.' 'And even more effective aimed at the heart' 'the temples or the kidneys.' 'Peter Rosser.' 'Code initial, "K."' 'Cover job, professor of archaeology.' 'The watch and a cavity ring' 'containing a magnesium flash' 'strong enough to temporarily blind' 'or to photograph with.' 'In fact, four of the six weapons' 'demonstrated in this film' 'were found on the body of this man.' Um, please, how much is that? Thirty piasters. Here. - Thank you. - Welcome. Picture, mister? Come this side of the counter. What? You're coming with us. Read. - "Mr. Rosser." - "Professor Rosser." Oh! I was a professor once. In Tahara. No, it was in Kuwait. I liked being a professor. Mr. Rosser, regarding your telegram "To Trent Brothers, Bombay "We regret delay in dispatching it "owing to technical defects. Supervisor." So, your message never went. Pity. So much careful cover wasted. Tell me, did you ever have to kill one of us? Mm. Yeah, that's very unpleasant this side of our work. Look... I've got 50 gold coins in my belt. Thank you, but what will they buy in Siberia? We'll get down here. Another sacrifice of Barback. There are many excavation holes. It's very safe... for us. Please. Just a little further, please. Yes, priority cable to London. Mack Travel, Covent Garden. 'Message reads' '"Still no form available on Middle East stakes. Stop.' '"Your horse maybe a non-runner.' 'Signature, Trent Brothers."' The bid, please. "Your horse may be a non-runner?" Well, that doesn't tell us much. Except, there's a distinct possibility old Rosser won't be collecting his pension. Or the routine CB for surviving. Mm. It's a pity work of a espionage doesn't make you a superman. We're a figment of modern folklore, Jackson. But a sitter for the 39 steps. And if old Rosser's taken the 40th step we're really in trouble. When did he say he'd report? Well, his last cable was nearly a week ago. Here they are. "Details following the 16th." Two days overdue? It's not like him at all. "Oil treaties seriously in danger." Now which treaties? What danger? I mean, are all our people so bloody cryptic? Maybe one of the other departments has something on it. Well, what do they have? You're talking as if we're all on the same side or something. We all spend more money and effort keeping secrets from one another than we do in getting them from the enemies. - It's bloody ridiculous. - 'Yes, sir.' - Duty officer. - 'Right.' Maybe Rosser had to get out of Lebanon quickly. Yeah, but he'd report from wherever he was for heaven sake. Yes, sir. Ask Bombay for further details properly coded and sent through security route AJAX. - Right, sir. - And send ours via Nassau. If there's nothing new by midnight we'll have to send somebody out. Well, now, what are the local events in the sunshine city of Beirut in lovely Lebanon this week? - Couldn't say offhand. - We'll find out. We're the travel agency, aren't we? Accredited members of the association. I want to know every state and public event for the next seven days. Exhibitions, conventions.. Anything that might provide us with a cover for an operator. Do we have any left in the Middle East? We'll have to use someone from the "B" register. Poor bastard. You have a more humane suggestion? - No, sir. - Well, if I had a pro left.. She was certain they didn't know as well as we do I'd use him. Fine job those defecting red boys have done. Now, get me out a cross-checked list of everyone in there who might legitimately attend any of the coming week's events in Beirut. May the Lord have mercy on his soul. - Anything? - No, sir. Oh, yes. What's on in Beirut? Not very much, I'm afraid. "State visit from the Prince of Zahlouf "next Wednesday. There's the "14th Postwar International "Malaria Conference being held in the university. "Ten English doctors attending. "And a Russian Aeroflot airliner is due tomorrow in the second stage of around-the-world peace flight." Alright. Is Jackson still here? - In the office, sir. - Okay. Water's on the boil, if you'd like some coffee, sir. Thanks, but we better keep it boiling. This could turn into a caffeine night. Alright, sir. Now, who's the Price of Zahlouf? - Zahlouf? - Yes, it's a state visit. "Prince of Zahlouf." - Oh, never mind. - This isn't my night, is it? No, there's still time. What have you got? Not much, I'm afraid. But they're the most possible. Alright.. "Edward Carl-Ross. service manager, European Automobiles." He once helped us get someone out of East Germany. He didn't know what he was doing but he did it very well. What he's supposed to be doing in Beirut? - Looking for business? - Not good enough. "Reverend Dudley-Calford. "Runs ties to the Iron Curtain Cathedral. Age 52, retired. Had his public bother in Canterbury. We got him out of it. In return he's delivered a few messages. Prague, Budapest. Well, if we've blackmailed him. Certain there. "Foreign correspondent. "Ex-senior policeman. Export manager, breakfast foods.." Look, this isn't what we want at all. I know, we're scraping the barrel, but what else? The malaria conference is our best bet but we're short on doctors. Well, wasn't there a neurologist up in Liverpool, or a Czech or a Pole who helped us out in Hungary in '48. We paid him with a British citizenship. - He died last year. - Oh, for God's sake. There must be more than one doctor on the register. There's a GP in Somerset. Dr. Love, I think. You used him once during the war in Burma. Did I? That's what it says on the card. "Dr. Jason Love, widower. "Studied medicine '46 to '51 "Oriel College, Oxford Bartholomew's Hospital, London MBBS 1951." Huh. "War service, 1939, '45 "India, Burma, Chittagong. Major trials, 1944.." - Chittagong? I've got him. - Anything dramatic? No, no, no, no. It was a piddling business. He helped us root out an enemy agent operating one of those cake tin radios. He sounds marvelously qualified. Well, at least he's a doctor. Now, all we have to do is persuade him to drop his practice and dash off to Beirut. - Very simple, I'm sure. - Now, what are his weaknesses? Anything usual once, unfortunately. Well, he must want something, Jackson. Everybody wants something. Maybe he just wants a quiet life. He must have some lust, some fear something that's exploitable. You're not a believer in the dignity of man are you, sir? Well, there're too many men for that. "Clubs, international sports. "Oxford and Cambridge. Cord Car Club, USA." - Never heard of a Cord car. - Hm? Well, it's the most expensive American status symbol ever put on wheels. It's practically a legend. It was made in the '30s. Years ahead of its time. Supercharged, super-souped.. It was a car of the young millionaires. I'd say Dr. Love is a car fetishist who isn't giving in to middle-age. - Thank you very much. - Not at all. - Dr. Love? - Yes. I'm glad I caught you. I'd like to discuss something rather personal. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm just going away for three weeks. My vacation. A Dr. West is in there. And he's a very good man. He's better than I am. But this isn't a professional visit, doctor. I don't know whether you remember me. It's merely 20 years ago. MagGillivray. Douglas MagGillivray. No, I'm sorry, the name's familiar but uh, not insurance, is it? Chittagong, '43. Chittagong? Good Lord. I was almost a virgin surgeon in those days. Yes, I remember you. You were a carman in intelligence. - No less. - That's right. Yes. Tell me whatever happened to that, uh Indian fellow we caught with the, uh, radio in a cake tin? He's probably in the Indian cabinet by now. Well, if you'll excuse me, I'm trying to get uh, to the air ferry by 9 o'clock. Doctor, this is rather urgent. What could be so urgent after 20 years? Look, uh.. May I ride with you? Yes, alright, if you don't mind dangerous driving. Follow us, Wilson, will you? Try to follow us, Wilson. Well, now, she's certainly.. Certainly a rare beast. Oh, she's more than that. She's unique. As far as I know, this is the only open one left in the country. Retractable headlights, front-wheel drive supercharged V8 engine electrical gearbox, Just think. All that in 1937. A vintage year. 'About the only thing that's hasn't come on with my car is' 'an engine and a wheel in each corner.' There's only one Cord rarer than this one and that's the LeBaron. Oh, the LeBaron. They cost over $8000 before the war. Cost even more now if you could find one. Would you give that for an old car? I'd give anything for that old car. Now, hold on to your medals. Here we go. - What about that engine? - What? - The engine. - Yes, it is a bit noisy. Doesn't she take them beautifully? - How are the brakes? - Wonderful. Stop at a sixpence. Hold tight. Well, that's new. I have to get that adjusted. Might be as well. Now, then, general, or field marshal or whatever you are now what is this urgent personal business you wanted to see me about? There're no Indian spies in our village. I want to ask your help in something not unlike that little affair. You can't be serious. I'm looking for a doctor who'd like a free ticket and expenses to attend a malaria conference in the Lebanon. Well, you're not looking this one's bought his own ticket to the South of France. Listen to this supercharger. Bloody lead's come lose again. Won't be a minute. The lead's alright. It must be the carburetor. Give me the toolkit, will you? It's behind the seat. Alright. Trouble is people think we've got armies of agents to send everywhere. It's the carburetor, alright. That's what it is. It's the carburetor. The fact is we're a small, understaffed hard-pressed group of badly paid civil servants. Yes, well, who isn't? That's why I need three weeks holiday. - Forceps. Um, spanner. - Hm? That's why we have to ask sometimes members of the public to help us. Well, why pick on me? Give me the small one, will you? Well, you're the only doctor on our list. We just want to make contact with our man in Beirut. It couldn't be simpler. Dirt in the jet. That's what it is. Dirt in the jet. I just thought you might be prepared to help your country again. Don't appeal to my patriotism. As far as I was concerned the war was over years ago. Trouble, sir? Can I help? Yes, as a matter of fact, you can. Look, could he nip back to that garage at the crossroads and get hold of a mechanic called Fred? Yes, of course. He's an old man with a limp and arthritis in both hands but he's been a mother to this car. Very good, sir. Well, I've had that pain. You want one of these? No, thanks, I don't smoke. What do you think happened to your man down there? Well, who knows? Maybe he's had an accident. Been knocked down, lost his memory? Or just pushed off on a holiday. Wise man. I don't necessarily think there's any mystery. I just want to know, that's all. How you're gonna find out now? Well, locate another doctor and pay his price. Lotsa luck. What's the weather like in Beirut now? Beautiful. Between 70 and 80. - Ideal holiday country. - Hmm. How long do you normally allow for a job like this? Two or three days, maybe four. I'm sorry about your plane. Look, suppose I was mad enough to do this what is there in it for me? Well, what do you want there to be in it for you? I don't know the rate for the job. Well, we'd certainly compensate you for your delayed holidays. Say, pay all your expenses in France. No, no, no, no. Forget it. I'm not really interested. Well, I'm sure you don't want another Military Cross. You know, it's really rather a pity you've got one of these still. On the other hand, it's not a LeBaron, is it? You couldn't get a LeBaron. We have ways of getting most things. What's the, uh, nightlife like in Beirut? Fabulous. - And the food? - Four star. You'd never get a LeBaron. He-he-he.. Well, if I knew where to get, well, I wouldn't be calling you. Well, find a LeBaron and buy it. As cheap as possible. That's the lot I think. Air ticket. Conference invitation, identification page passport and visa, currency and a photo of Rosser. How's he taking it? Seems to think it's some sort of joke. Let's hope he's right. - Yes? - Dr. Love, sir. 'Well, did they get you fitted out, alright.' Fitted out. I feel like a commercial traveler. Look at this. Joke pen. Fires a Novocain dot 15 yards. And take a look at this do-it-yourself spy kit. We have enough drugs here to kill half the population of Lebanon. And here, enough pentothal to get the truth out of a whole hospital full of psychopathic liars. And, of course, another pen to inject it with. Oh, really, MacGillivray. It's too ridiculous. What do I need this stuff for? Well, you probably don't but having them helps psychologically. Well, it doesn't help me psychologically. You sure there's nothing dangerous in this? Well, we wouldn't be negotiating for a LeBaron Cord for absolutely nothing, would we? You found one? Well, we put a requisition in for one. Oh, well.. So as long as it's clearly understood that I'm not a cross between Superman and a spy in black.. Yes, well, I do hope you're not because that kind of exhibitionism always ends in tragedy. Come on now. I'll get you to the dentist. Dentist? What the hell do I need a dentist for? This minute transistor will fit quite comfortably into the cavity left by your old filling, doctor. Oh, yeah. It could be sensitized by a slight rub with any piece of foil or a silver paper. - Is that so? - 'Mm-hmm.' 'I shall now cover the device' 'with a special plastic' um, which can be removed quite easily. - Thank you very much. - Mm-hm. Alright? Excellent. Excellent. Well, we have to be at London airport within the hour. - Mm-hmm. - Nearly finished? And, fortunately, he had an excellent cavity in the lower left molar. - Oh, good. - Right. - You can rinse now. - Yes, do rinse now. What am I supposed to get on this thing, worker's playtime? It's strong enough to drive most electronic instruments mad it knocks them off balance. It also beams an emergency signal. And then I suppose you'll send one of those nice fitted trunks to pick me up. No, I know you, you're helping me psychologically. Now let me get you out of this. No, let her do it. She's much prettier. Alright. When you change planes at Rome one of our people will make contact. They're waiting for these. They would identify themselves by the phrase "Business hardly warrants keeping me here. It's been a bad year." And you would reply, "A bad year everywhere." You mean you people are still doing this sort of thing? Yeah. Well, you'll hand them these. You'll miss the first two connections then you'll get the 13:45 to Beirut. You're booked in at Rosser's hotel, The Alcazar. Oh, that's very cozy. Now, what's that, uh, password again? "Bad year everywhere." "Bad year everywhere." Now, this watch is another identification. Wear it, hmm? I suppose that contains another radio. As a matter of fact, it does but the instructions are in your wallet. "Love from uncle?" Now, this is your most important identification. Page 334 of Plato's dialogues. Oxford pocket edition. The key words are underlined. "And he who lies himself to be taken prisoner "may as well be made a present of to his enemies. "He is their lawful prey. Let them do what they like with him." If you were one of my patients, I think I'd have you certified. - Excuse me. Are you English? - Yes. Did you just come in on the London plane? That's right. Well, I'm supposed to be meeting someone. Have you all come through customs? Yeah, but don't be nervous because the airline business is, um uh, been very bad everywhere this year. What? For business. It-it's bad, isn't it? What? Business generally or yours in particular? - Oh. - Ah! There she is. Look, it's been so nice talking with you. Just to cheer you up, I guess it isn't as bad as you think it is. - What? - Business. Bye-bye. Would you mind if I borrowed your bag? Only for a moment. 'The laugh. Happy! Yes! That's right! Now..' Beautiful, beautiful. Allora! And again. Once, once more. The smile. Teeth, lots of teeth. Beautiful. Beautiful. Very good. Very good! 'And again, huh?' 'Slowly. Look for someone.' - Magnifico. We have enough. - Yes. Thank you. - It's heavy, isn't it. - What was all that? Was that press, or publicity or... No, fashion magazines. Business hardly warrants keeping me here. It's been a bad year. I see. What did you say? It was not important. It was. It's been a bad year everywhere. Wait there. Don't worry about this outfit. I'll get it back to the couturiere. For the gentleman wants to buy me a cappuccino. Don't let him make you late tomorrow, huh? And don't let Pepe make you late. This is a pleasant surprise. Let's have some coffee. - You have something for me? - Hm? You have something for me? Oh, yes, these. Are you in any other? May I have a note? - Cappuccino. - Signorina. I thought, um, contacts like you only happened in paperbacks. It is safest for you to wait here until your plane goes. Goodbye. And good luck. Now wait a minute. Whoa, whoa. You can't leave me sitting there all alone for three hours drinking coffee. Your plane leaves in two hours. Not according to my itinerary, I'm on the 13:45 for Karachi. 'Signore, due cappuccino.' Coffee? Grazie. Sugar? The 13:45 is Pan Orient Airlines. It does not go to Karachi. Do you have any other identification? Love from uncle. You are to be more careful. I was only joking about Karachi. Leave 200 lira. Wait a minute. What did I do? You told me you were going to Beirut. On that... you're used to replacing K. Get in. Who's K? Never mind. Oh, what the hell. You must know the score anyway. As it happens, I didn't. Where you gonna take me, Siberia? Not exactly. I have an apartment not far away. You will be out of harm's way there. Thank you. And you can put that anywhere. Fix yourself a drink. There. I better get out of these pajamas. Call me if you need any help. After all, we're in this thing together. Well, this is nice. You can wave to me from here when I take off. Which of your jobs pays for this? 'Modeling, of course.' Mind if I look at your etchings? Mm. - These pictures are wonderful. - Oh. I'm going to get you something to eat. Hmm? No, no, no, please. I had one of those strange trays on the plane. Don't worry about me. I'm not. I'm worried about me. I've been up since dawn. The photographers prefer the morning light. So do I. But unfortunately, I won't be here on the morning. Too bad. Over there. You know, I don't believe any of this. How long have you been in this game? I started with "Vogue." Ho! That's not what I meant. I know what you meant. Well? Do you mind garlic? It all depends who's breathing it on me. Why do you do it? Don't you earn enough modeling? In this business, it isn't polite to ask questions. Which business? - My business. - Oh. Back to the garlic. But, I'm curious about one thing. Why are they sending you to Beirut and not me? You're not a doctor. Doctor? The malaria conference. I see. So that's the cover. You know how you worry in this business. I wouldn't know. But I don't know anything. I don't even know who this K is you tell me I'm replacing. - Oh, please, doctor, mm? - No, really. As soon as I've located a man called Rosser in Beirut I'm away, back to my practice like a homing pigeon. - I'm not one of your lot. - You're not? No. I'm just doing this to help out some old army acquaintance. Well, they are giving me a vintage car as well. It's such a stupid story. It must be true. What's your stupid story? I don't tell this to everyone, but.. My mother was Mata Hari and my father was Sherlock Holmes. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to pry, but how many lovely lady spies do I see at my surgery? Uh! It's not done to say spy. What is done between people in our, uh, line of business? Not a great deal of sleeping together. It's regarded as unprofessional. Now if one of the professionals is an amateur.. You're on the 13:45 to Beirut. Look... if I were to catch a later plane but that'd be very, uh, unprofessional. Very. You're a little old for me, of course but, you know it's terrifying, when you look at like that I'd tell you everything. I'd give you my spy kit, my password identity papers, traveler's cheques, everything. So, I must not tempt you. Oh, please do. See how good I'd be under torture. How you shave around your mustache? I'll demonstrate for you. But you, you won't be here in the morning. I've been known to shave in the afternoon. Shall I call the airport? What's the number? Well, when you look at me like that I'm, uh, almost tempted to give it to you. That's wonderful. We'd charge the whole thing to expenses. Now, wait a minute. Wait. Wait, wait, wait. I said I'd do a job, I'd... better get it over with first. You English are such Boy Scouts. I'll be back in a couple of days. How 'bout on the way back? Thanks. But my moods don't last that long. I'll call you a taxi. Things I do for England. This is the last call for passengers traveling on Pan Orient Airlines 'flight 275 to Beirut.' Flight 275 to Beirut is now closed. That's confirmed, Dr. Love. Your reservation's switched to Middle East Airlines flight 493 leaving at 15:40. Will that give you enough time? I hope so. Thank you. Thank you, doctor. 'Pan Orient Airline announced' 'the departure of their flight 275 to Beirut.' What's all that made of? It's the Soviet dove of peace on a world tour. Well, you gotta hand it to those Russkies at least they pretend to sell peace and not Coca-Cola. Are there, uh, many English in Beirut? Many English, many Aleman, many French. Yes.. All foreign people come for Jabal. What's that, a local specialty? Big blossom, big castle. Very old, all broken down now. Eh, my brother-in-law Alfonse he was taken there in first-class American car. Hey, hey, you want excursion, day or night you call my brother-in-law Alfonse Farouk. No, I don't think I'll have, uh, much time for excursions. Oh, keep, keep, you never know what happen in Beirut. - Bonjour, Monsieur. - Bonjour. Good morning. I'm Dr. Love. I have a reservation. - Dr. Love? - Yes. The booking was made in London. - But they said you were dead. - Who did? They called up and canceled your room. They said you had been killed in an air crash. Well, as you can see, I wasn't. Eh, oui, oui, monsieur. It is most fortunate. I'm sure we can find you a room. The best room. Ah, yes, doctor. I have a beautiful room for you. Number 207. - Who canceled my room? - I do not know, doctor. Maybe someone from the airline. Perhaps you have a friend there. I'll be very interested to know. Certainly, monsieur. I will make it my business to find out. Pleased to leave your passport, monsieur. Oh, yes, excuse me. And, uh, may I take this? Please, monsieur. And please, relax. Relax and try and enjoy your stay with us. Pan Orient Aviation, s'il vous plait. Thank you. "Not dead yet, love." No signature? No, they'll get the message. Four-eighty, please. And I'd like to, uh, make a local call. Fifteen piasters. It's, uh.. Wait a minute. Two, wait a minute. 2-5-1-3-4-0. - Thank you. - On telephone number three. Thank you. Uh, Alcazar Hotel? Reception, please. Oh, reception, is Mr. Rosser in the hotel? He's not back yet, sir. We tried his room a little while ago for another gentlemen. Well, this the, um University archeological library. We have a book here of Mr. Rosser. When will he be back? Did he leave an address or telephone number or anything? No, but he's often away for a few days. You may send the book here. I see. His room is 42, isn't it? Ah, 307. Thank you so much. Stand up. 'Keep your hands out of your pockets.' 'Raise 'em above your head. Arms on to me.' Don't try any smart stuff. Are you Rosser? I'll ask the questions. Turn around. Now, face me. What do you want here? I'm a friend of Rosser's. And you don't even know what he looks like. Don't give me that chat. Who are you? Well? You'll never believe this, but.. Alright, now, what are you doing here? If you won't tell me about you, then I'll tell you about me. I'm a doctor. I came here for a conference. Like you, Plato is also my bedside reading. I also do business with the Mack Travel Agency in Covent Garden. We might have friends in that firm. On the other hand we might not. I'll give you three to prove it either way. One.. You'll never fire that thing. Two.. Love from uncle. You really a doctor? Certainly. I'm glad I'm not one of your patients. I see they've fixed you up with Mack's toys. Only time I tried to use one of those things the bloody thing blow up in my face. Can I have my gun back? Yes, of course. I'm sorry I hit you with that bag. I'm not a pro in this business. Well, as one myself, I should say you are learning. But I'll give you a bit of advice. Get rid of all that gear and get yourself a good heavy gun. Who are you after? Rosser. Like you apparently. Now, we call him K. I was to look him up on my way back from Singapore. I've had a bit of jaundice and I've got six weeks leave. I thought your eyes were a bit yellow. Yeah, well, K and I used to know each other in Penang but he hasn't been around lately so I thought I'd have a look. Where do you think he is? In heaven, or hell. I think it was rumbled. I've been all through the room. There's no diary, no engagement pad no clue of any thoughts of where he was going. Just an airline ticket and a copy of a post office message about a cable that hadn't got sent. Well, what do we do now? We do the professional thing we have a drink. You mean, we just walk out of the door? Well, I'm not climbing out the bloody window. What happens if somebody sees us up here? We got lost. You worry about the damnedest things. Somebody must've seen him leave. Someone did. We have to find out who. How we do that? We ask them. That's it. Is any of it bloody safe? We're down. Oh. Taxi! Taxi! - Does that interest you? - What do I have to do? You'll get the other one when you've done it. See if any of the taxis working the Alcazar picked up this man last Friday. - Can I take it? - Yes, but give it back. Now, take us to come club, somewhere with a bit of life. Yes, sir! I hear the Shan Noir is quite active. Shall I take you to Shan Noir? Why not? You haven't wasted your time, have you? Bring us a bottle of Scotch. And, uh, make sure the seal isn't broken. Oui, monsieur. Can't be too careful in these joints. Not with jaundice you can't. Ah, don't give me all that doctor's cobblers about being careful. Suit yourself. You're not on my panel. No. Voila, monsieur. Yeah, leave it. We'll serve ourselves. Oui, monsieur. Twelve years I've been in this joint and I can tell you there's more raving kids in Bradford the nerves than the whole bloody, mysterious Orient. Oh, cheer up, chum, it's all in a day's work. I saw a plane full of people blow up today. Yeah, I read about that. Funny sort of accident. I was supposed to be on that plane. I missed it. Purely by chance. Maybe it wasn't an accident. Maybe that explosion has your name written on it. Maybe they're after you. Oh, that's ridiculous. Well, planes don't blow up for no reason, matey. Well, they don't blow up for me. I'm not that important. Oh, do you know. How do I know? But there were 60 or 70 people on that plane. Well, maybe what they are planning is worth it. What on earth could be going on that's worth that? We don't know. That's why tomorrow we have to find out what was in K's last cable. I came here for fun, I came here to change the routine. And I'm already responsible for the death of 60 people. Any moment you might be responsible for six million. Any of us might. Stop trying to figure it out you may as well take your kill pill now. There I was selling insurance in Bradford happily miserable, and fairly in a normal sort of way. This fellow says, "We'll give you the government's business." They gave me business alright. Now, the only one I can't get insured is me. I'm a bad life risk. You will be, if you go on knocking that stuff back. Oh, well, I'm not trying to sell you insurance so stop trying to sell me medical advice. 'Your taxi is waiting, sir.' - Give me the bill. - No, I'll take it. Oh, God, I feel rough. You enjoy the cabaret, sir? Yeah.. Oui, monsieur. Merci, monsieur. I'm alright. I don't need an arm. Hey, sir! This man saw something. - He want to tell you himself. - Yes, I see something. Give him ten. I know your friend well. I drive him three, four times. Did you drive him last Friday? - No. - Oh, what bloody use is that? He saw something! He saw something! Did you see him leave the hotel? - I saw. - What did you see? Uh, he go with two men in car. - In a taxi? - No, taxi. American car. What make? What kind of car? - Uh, black car. It was Packard. - It was Packard. Uh, old Packard, uh, Salon. Very old. From before the war. Trumpet horns, big horns? Uh, long.. Yes, long. - An-and big lights? - Big, big. - Pre-war 8. - So, now we know. So what? My guts ache. He say you pay me fare if I talk, eight pounds. Where do you live? Uh, capital. Oh, my guts. If you please, sir. Thank you, gentlemen. Thank you. - Is there a pharmacy open? - Uh, yes, sir. Hamra Street. All night. Well, we stop there on the way. And, uh, give me that photograph back. Do you speak English? Yes, I have matriculated. What can I do for you, sir? Well, it's about a telegram. It hasn't arrived. - You have details, sir. - Yes. A business associate of mine, Mr. Rosser, R-O-S-S-E-R sent an important cable to a firm in Bombay. They say it hasn't arrived and we'd like an explanation. You're welcome, sir. 'When was it sent, sir?' Four days ago. Oh, yes. Here we are, monsieur. As you see it was canceled. But does it say why or by whom it was canceled? It was accepted by a colleague. I'll ask him now to come and speak to you. Thank you. How do you feel? - Did you get it? - Yes, I got it. So did they. In case the room's bugged. They sent one of their men down to the post office with Rosser's passport and a note canceling the cable. Well, if they've got his passport they've got him, poor bastard. Maybe they're just holding him. Well, I hope not for his sake. "El Wadi expected "to win Middle-East stake. Stop. "Betting Asian boys. "Second, jumping star. Third, stop." Make any sense to you? No, not without my code book. You get into bed. I'll find it. Where is it? Top drawer. "Oxford Dictionary Of Quotations." And there's some paper too. Hey, while you're doing this I have an idea about the package. You've got a line? Well, it's a garage. It specializes in secondhand American cars. They may have heard of a 1937 Packard. There can't be many around here. Well, it's a chance. Yes? Oh, I'm sorry. Yes, straight away. They don't like us playing our tune so loud. I'll go and see about this. 'Mr. Farouk?' Your brother-in-law suggested I should talk to you. My brother-in-law is a camel's exhaust. All he wants is a quick commission. Look, Mr. Farouk... Can't an artist work in peace? Trouble with the, uh, differential, eh? Always was difficult to get at for this model. You're a Chevy man? Yes, until I found my Cord. Cord? 37' Supercharge. 812. You've got a Cord? The only roadster in England. Uh, put it there, buster. Me, I've had a '35 Auburn Speedster. And I once drove a Duesenberg SJ. Oh, but to own a Cord? Huh! That is true greatness. You ought to become a member of the Urban Cord Duesenberg club. You wait there. Don't go away. Don't go away. You wait. I show you something. Here. I will show you something. I bet you didn't think you're going to meet one here. Here it is. Only member in Lebanon. There's only four of us in England. Ah, yes. We are a dying race, man. - Well, what can I do for you? - Right. Do you know anybody who has a black, pre-war Packard 8. I think it's an 8. Why do you want a car like that for? I got better. Oh, this one has a special interest for me. Ah.. Pre-war Packard Coupe 6. I know a guy at the American Embassy owns one. But Packard 8? No. There's nobody local owns one. Oh, well... it was just a longshot. - Thank you very much. - Alright. Hey, wait a minute. I-I-I think I've seen one. Yes, that's right. He was turning into a garage on Rue D'.. Come on, I'll take you there now. No, I can't come. I have a date. I take you to your date. Well, I think I'd rather like to walk. I wanna see the town. Look, I'll take you to your date you find your Packard, and after that I'll show you the town. It's on the house. You can't lose. Get in. In this I drive you can tell me all about your 1937 Supercharged Cord. Parkington? My name is Love. I'm a doctor. I've been treating Mr. Parkington. There's no reply from his room. I'm afraid he may be very ill. But Mr. Parkington, uh went, uh, out. When? Since, uh, 20 minutes. - Was he alone? - Oh, oui, monsieur. Here he comes. Why did you get up? I had some urgent business. The cable? Anything on the car? I'm gonna find out. My driver's the contact. - Contact? - Oh, he's alright. We belong to the same club. I know it sounds ridiculous, but.. It does sound ridiculous but I'll take your word. Let's go. This is Farouk. - Hello. Glad to meet you. - Hi. Your buddy an ACD man? I've been trying to get him interested. You should really try, mister. What did the cable say? 'To get him to the select range' 'of we proud owners' 'over Auburn or Duesenberg' 'or a Cord, which not too many of us' 'can aspire like your friend here.' 'I tell you, buster, that you're really in' 'a class on your own.' But the sixth is tomorrow. That's why we can't stat at ten, darling. - Did you cable Mac? - Well, of course. Shouldn't we tell anybody down here? And blow our cover? Righto. Suicide. Oh, we've come to the Packard place now. It's the old house before the gas station. The garage is one of those great electric roll-up doors. Well, don't drive right up to the place. We don't want to look too eager. 'Sure, sure. I get it.' Hey, you want me to buy the car for you? I get a damn better price than you fellas. No, just drop us. Let me pay for the refill. Gee, no, it's not necessary. It's been a pleasure. He-he-he. - I insist. - 'Okay, if you insist.' 'See you around.' Packard 8 alright. Well, we found 8 Packard. Where does that get us? I know someone is there, because the alarm sounded. 'If you're not local thieves' 'you maybe friends of the Englishman.' 'I will give you three to come out' 'with your hands above your head.' Otherwise, I will kill you as you stand. 'One..' Inside pocket. Get the pen. Quick! - Now, bare his arm. - Ah! Alright. Flesh wound. Get the pentothal. Do you hear me? Where's Rosser? Where is K? The Englishman you collected in this car from the Alcazar Hotel? We drove up north. How far north, over the border? The-the Damascus road. 'Where on the Damascus road?' Barback. We-we went to Barback. Did you kill him? Why? - Orders. - Who's orders? Now, get out. Out! - Come on. - I can't. Leave me. Shut up. Save your breath. Leave me. Leave me. Come on. Try. 'How do I look, doc?' Better than I thought. Let's get your knees up. You're a lousy liar, doc. How did you know? If we could just stop the bleeding.. You can't. It's, it's too late. Listen, Love. Clear out my room. Burn everything. Cable Mac and get the hell back to England. You may be a good doctor but you're a bloody awful spy. This is no ordinary assassination. We haven't taken all this trouble to bring you here to eliminate another petty, feudal despot. I understand the implications very well, doctor. We have checked every kilometer of the state route. The position we have chosen is perfect for the trajectory of the bullet. The moment the principal's dead our friends at Zahlouf will take over the government. The loss of Zahlouf soil will be a major military defeat for Britain. You're no longer a mere assassin. You are a liberating army. I have never missed in the past and I will not miss tomorrow. Entre. I'm sorry to interrupt, doctor but there is an emergency case in the surgery. We finish. Uh, you better leave by the side door. They were in the garage. They were looking at the car. There was some shooting Fedoski's dead and so is one of the English. English? Which English? Well, there were two of them. I've never seen them before. - What's this? - I-it's nothing. - Just a scratch. - They gave you something. No, no, no. It's nothing. Believe it. You stupid ox. You think I'm an idiot? This is an intravenous injection. What did they give you? They knocked me down. Before I could do anything they injected me. I tried to stop them. Sir, believe it, please. And what did you tell them? What? Answer me! I can remember nothing. Oh! What did you tell them? I can't remember. I can't remember. So, it was pentothal. And God knows what you've said. I don't know. I don't know. 'You're under arrest. 'Dress his wound and remove him.' It would seem their man was not on the plane you so rashly blew up. It's impossible. Then who has just cost us two men at the most critical time? They must've brought in replacements from another area. Your guessing games are becoming too expensive, Simmias. I hold you personally responsible for the elimination of this man, whoever he is. He'll be found and eliminated. Knowing the pleasure you get out of your perquisites here in Lebanon I'm sure you will not fail. Alright, come on out with your hands above your head before I make a mess of that bathroom door. Hello. Mon Dieu. Is that loaded? - Vikki? - Please, put it down. - I'm terrified of guns. - Uh, what are you... I thought it was the femme de champ. What are you doing in Beirut? A rush modelling job, for "Harper's." But why here? Me on the ruins of Byblos Castle with the prince's state visit in the background. Arabs are the fashion this season. Oh, some fashion. Has it been difficult? How'd you know I was here? My dear doc. We do work for the same firm after all. That's right. - Anything on K yet? - Just a minute. How did you get into my room? Oh, I simply told a very French speaking desk clerk that I was passing through and wanted to surprise an old and terribly close friend. Well, you certainly did. Now, Vikki. You're gonna take your pictures and get out of Beirut. Oh, doctor, are you protecting me? No, it's not a joke anymore. One man's been killed already. - One of our men. - Who? Ango Parkington. Oh.. - Have you cabled Mac? - Not yet. I will, of course. I'm not a complete bloody fool. Not complete, darling doctor. Mac is very grateful to you for trying. But... Trying? I'll say I'm trying. I've also been succeeding far more than poor Parkington did to say nothing of K. K? What do you know about K? He's dead. I know who killed him and how and where. That's not bad, huh, for a stupid amateur who's only been in your dishonorable profession for 48 hours. Only more reason why you should go back now. There is a plane at 6:00. You have to be on it. And that's an order. Mac ordered you to tell me? We are both under orders, clever doctor. Now, are we going to waste our time until 6:00? I do hope not. I think we should just stay here till plane time. Don't you? Oh, yes, it is a perfectly charming awful, typical hotel room. We stay. - Vikki. - What? Why are you throwing yourself at me? Oh, now, doctor. Do I have to explain metabolism? You know the biology of it. Perhaps, you could give me a lecture. Well, first of all, you're very beautiful. I know. You talk too much. Kiss me instead. Eh, it may sound rather British but I usually... arrange my own seductions. You're the doctor. - Thank heavens. - For what? You're not a patient. If this is true, gentlemen, it is very grave news indeed. We depend on Zahlouf for almost half our power consumption. I see this came from Beirut. Do we have nothing from Zahlouf? I'm afraid we don't have a man there, sir. Our Middle East establishment is somewhat depleted. How many men do you have in Lebanon? Two, sir. Possibly three. Three men to save half the oil supplies of this country? - Are you out of your minds? - Well, almost. Because the only one we can be sure is alive is the chap who sent that cable. But our job is to protect that oil. I just hope your one live man in Beirut knows what he's doing. What are you thinking about? Jason Love. I've never known a Jason before. It was my father's name. - What did he do? - Who, my father? No. Eh, Jason. Ah, he found the golden fleece. I see.. Like father, like son. In order to get it he made love to an enemy princess. So, at the end... does the princess who met Jason love? Very much indeed. - Stay inside. - Are you alright? We must get away from here. Now. You were right about catching that plane. There will be police up here, any minute. Do you want to start explaining? Leave everything. - Oh! - Alright. I got it. Your plane leaves in an hour. It's 20 minutes to the airport. Vikki, I'm not leaving. I'm not leaving you in all this. But, I'll be alright. I'm going tomorrow. As soon as we've taken the castle pictures. Oh, the hell with the castle pictures. Let's go now. That's impossible. I have my orders. You mean, you mean, those photographs are all part of... Now, please. Please, don't be stubborn. You've done what you were sent for. - Go before you're killed. - I'll go when you go. Look, you've been ordered to leave. Leave! Oh, the hell with Mac's orders. - I am sick of 'em. - You must go. Vikki! - I won't. - Listen. You stupid pig-headed fool. Do I have to tell you? You can't stay with me! I work for the other side. Do you understand now, doctor? I work for the other side! - You, a double agent? - Yes. I am a double agent. Don't you believe in anything? What difference will it make? I work for "Vogue." I work for "Harper's." I work for them. I work for you. What difference which side? It's a business, isn't it? I am on my side. Dear God, what do we do now? You go to the airport. And get on the first plane out of Lebanon. Go back to your patients, doctor. And you, you go back to Rome? I've been moved out of Rome. Where to? Wouldn't Mac like to know. I'd like to. I can't take any more chances. Even for you. Vikki? Ho! 'Vikki!' Your cab, doctor. Beirut Airport. Goodbye. Good luck, doctor. Vikki! Ah! I hoped that Mac would come up with something but... that was really magnificent service. So you are the English amateur who in two days has cost us two operators and the people of Zahlouf their liberation. I see. And you're not exactly rescuing me. You just attacked the man we were trying to rescue. It's all very unfortunate, isn't it? Don't worry, he's expandable. You're invaluable. I would've hated to see you wasted on a mob. Get down. Take off your jacket. Throw it on the ground. Now get your hands up. Now, Doctor Love, let's have no illusions about one another. You'd like to escape and I'd enjoy putting several bullets in your back while you did so. Only I can get you through those excellent Lebanon police who are very anxious to question you, doctor about a man you shot on your balcony. I'll be very happy to tell them. Would you? And how your own Mr. Parkington died? I can fill him in on that too. For myself, I am more interested in the details of your new Middle East network. The only information I can give you is medical. I'm tired of English jokes. I want facts! Dr. Love, I intend to extract the information I require. How painful do you wish it will be? Look, I came here to find out what happened to Rosser. There's nobody else with me. And before you hit me again if I had any bloody information I'd give it to you. I'm not with MI6 and I'm not paid to be heroic. I see. Now, the serious discussion starts, Dr. Love. I have the man. I have told Bianker of our shameful fiasco. But you must tell them. I have the man who did it. Bianker wants the man who let him do it. You mean, I.. I have to go back? No, I have to go back. I must explain. I must try to excuse. I'm responsible. And I'll tell you this, Simmias, I will not forget the position you have put me in. Give him an injection to keep him quiet. I will remember you, Simmias. What are my orders? There will be many inquiries about this morning go back and make sure you preserve cover. Pentothal can't change my story. We haven't given you pentothal yet, Dr. Love. As for you, Dr. Simmias, I would suggest that you lost no time in getting your affairs in order. Dah. What's this bloody fool of yours trying to do win the Cold War single-handed? You send him out to make a perfectly simple inquiry. Within 48 hours he's got the entire Lebanese Peace Force looking for him. He's suspected of shooting three men and not a single damn word of explanation. He seems to have prevented the assassination not an entirely unimportant objective. Alright, alright, objective accomplished. Now, I've got the PM and the foreign secretary to satisfy about our methods. What do I tell them? Tell them we've saved the prince's life by our methods. Suppose Lebanon and the press find out that this mad doctor is one of ours. There's more trouble. Nothing to the trouble he may be in by now. We can't concern ourselves with his bad luck. You'd do better to dream up some cover for us. He's an alcoholic or a psycho. Something I can disclaim convincingly. He may even be dead. Well, that would help a little, of course. 'Save your strength, Dr. Love.' We do not have to handle you with time wasting delicacy, doctor. It is of no consequence to anyone if your bruises show. You are a citizen of nowhere, traveling nowhere. How quickly you get there depends on you. I know nothing. I can tell you nothing. Of course not. In case you should bite off your tongue before it talks. Now, we will continue. How many men in your department working in the Lebanon? I don't know. I'm a doctor. I'm surprised that a man of your intelligence requires so much persuading to tell the truth. Ah! Good for you, doctor. Funny how some of these amateurs turn out. Tell Sir Robert that, will you? Personal call coming through from Beirut for you, sir. - Beirut? - Yes, one moment please. It's the British Embassy, sir. Calling direct, that's a bit unusual, isn't it? It's booked as a personal call, sir. Alright, I'll take it in my office. You better come in. MacGillivray speaking. I've been asked to get directly in touch with you with some most urgent information. It's seems that the Russian plane "The Dove Of Peace" is on route to Russia. Yes, I know that seems reasonable. My information is that there's a bigwig in the Russian intelligence organization on board. A man called Stanilaus. Stanilaus? He's the biggest we've ever got, major. Also a fellow named Love. Well, apparently the man calls himself a doctor. One of your chaps, I presume. Are you quite sure about this, major? I've simply been asked to get the information directly to you. By a chap who's applying for political asylum. Yes. What's all this about Stanilaus? What's the route of that damn Russian Peace plane? As far as I remember, Bangkok, Beirut, Casablanca, Habana across Canada over the pole and home. Permissions all applied for and granted. Why? Then we'll have to try and bring it down in Canada. Bring it down? But how, for God's sake, and why? And what are the Russians gonna say? Provided they don't say "Drop the bomb," it'll be worth it. I know I have orders for this government but this is plain crazy. Well, do what the man says. Well, what do you make of that? How can they sit in offices and dream up these things? Ours is not to reason why. Ours is just to bring down a Russian jetliner without a shot being fired in anger. Take over. Alright, out you come, Bill, Tom. Come on, fellows. - At the double. - What's the scene, man? We gotta evacuate all the Eskimos. Do which? Haul 'em by wagon to Regina City. What the hell for? Ah, that they haven't told us yet. Okay, Jimmy. Get the big wagon warmed up. How long we got then, hmm? Where's the Peace plane now? Last signal from Bermuda, half an hour ago it was just putting down in Habana. Now, Dr. Love, if you are ready we will begin again. The complete details of your associates in the Middle East. Don't you ever listen. I don't know. I observe that you are bloody but unbowed, Dr. Love. We will now proceed to bow you. An intelligent man like yourself, Dr. Love will realize very quickly that you are safely contained... as you would be in the Lubyanka prison. You have no connection with the outside world.. '...except for the perforated wall of the storeroom.' 'You have noted it. Good.' 'Behind this grill there are six small vents' 'which can be opened and closed from where I am.' 'Now, as I open them...' the pressure of the room is reduced by the out rush of air from the inside. As the pressure becomes lower and lower, Dr. Love.. He-he. I've no need to describe the symptoms of asphyxiation to a doctor. 'There is no alternative other than' 'friendly cooperation, Dr. Love.' 'You will see a button next to your seat.' 'When you are ready to talk, press that.' 'Then your eardrums will ache and perhaps burst' 'your nose will bleed, your lungs will strain for air.' You'll be most uncomfortable. Then eventually, Dr. Love, unless you press the button you will die. 'It usually only takes a few minutes.' 'Weathership Cape Hatteras reporting Aeroflot' 'Z-K-B-double 7-5-2-1 passing now.' 'Approximate height 25,000 feet.' 'Bearing north by northwest.' 'Halifax reporting.' 'Aeroflot ZKB77521 crossing us now.' 'Approximate height 25,000 feet.' 'Message ends. Out.' - How long before 0? - Six minutes from now, sir. - Right, get your man moving. - Sir. Certain. How many men does your department have in Lebanon? I don't know. What code book do you use? "Guide to Lebanon." How long have you been in this? Two days. I'm a doctor. 'No one can be so brave or so stupid.' 'Unless he's been trained under deep hypnosis.' 'In which case there is nothing any of us can do' 'until we get him back.' Drink this. Don't try to talk yet. Just drink. My ridiculous doctor. If only you had gone home when I told you. Vikki, what are you doing here? I'm going back to get my new posting. I'm sorry for what they have done to you. I'm still alive. I'm glad. If only you would tell them... it would be so easy. Everything. I'm gonna tell them. What sleep does MacGillivray lose over me? What do I owe him? He has no right to play games with your life. 'No one has.' 'Calling Russian Dove of Peace' 'Calling Aeroflot ZKB77521.' 'Regina Lake air radio station' 'calling Russian Dove of Peace.' 'Need help urgently.' 'Settlement ablaze.' 'Serious casualties must be evacuated.' 'Will Aeroflot ZKB, please land on lake.' 'I will repeat.' 'Please land on lake for urgent evacuation.' 'Runway marked by lit red and yellow drums.' 'Repeat. Lit red and yellow drums mark runway.' 'This is urgent. Come in now on this wavelength.' 'Over to you. Over.' - So, doctor. - We are going down? It's not necessary. But there are people dying down there. My dear child, people died on that plane you helped us to blow up. If I had known what you were planning I would never have passed the information. 'Someone else will help them.' In the meantime, Dr. Love is going to help us. I'm only sorry, doctor, that you did not come to this conclusion sooner. It was no pleasure to subject you to those, uh, discomforts. Do not sulk, my emotional colleague. Bring us coffee instead. Could I have something a little stronger? Bring cognac and vodka as well and cigarettes. - You prefer American... - Anything at all. So, why did you decide suddenly to cooperate? Firstly, I've taken just about all I can take. And secondly, seeing her here helped, I suppose. She's charming and devoted. Oh, perhaps a little sentimental. I'm a little sentimental, too, about people dying of burns and exposure. I, uh, hope you like our cognac. I personally prefer it even to the French. Thank you. Leave us now. So.. Of what does your organization consist? I work with five men, all new to the Middle East mostly recruited from the professions. Names? Code only. Mine is Z. The others are Y, X, W, V, U. Indeed. As you know, all our agents from A to K have been eliminated. I see. Your post office? I beg your pardon. To what address does your information eventually go? Oh, Cohen Smoked Salmon Limited, Edgware Road. Your code book? I take it you're no longer using "The Oxford Book Of Verse?" - No, we've changed that. - What is the new one? "The Kama Sutra." "The Kama Sutra?" Oh, Obelisk English language edition. This book is banned in our country. That's precisely why they chose it. Please help yourself. We will talk further. - May I go to the lavatory? - Yes, of course. Josef! 'Are you alright?' I won't be a minute. - Your premier... - I'm sorry to disturb you. But does anyone have a light? Honestly, you people are manic depressive. You have lied to me, doctor. Look, I wouldn't be so stupid to.. - Please, don't! - Get back inside! I'm never going to get the truth out of you, am I? You got it. The girl does not confirm your story. Why should she? The whole set up's new, I told you. Only six of us were involved. Oh, no, no, Dr. Love. You will be no help to me in Moscow. There is something wrong with the controls. 'Lake Erie to Regina Lake.' Russian Peace plane dropping to 15,000 feet. 'No explanation. Over.' They must be coming here. Strange, they haven't answered our call. Maybe they're weak on English, sir. 'Aeroflot ZKB77521.' Reporting failure of navigational instruments. We are dropping to 10,000 feet to fly visually. 'Please clear air lanes. Over.' Regina Lake calling ZKB77521. Message received. Air lanes being cleared for you. Gimme this one. Hello, ZKB, are you listening? Over. 'ZKB listening. Over.' Will you please help us? We are on your direct route. We have many burnt and injured people here. Fires are still raging. 'We have to evacuate these people.' 'Please help us, ZKB. Over.' This is ZKB, Soviet Dove of Peace. We have heard your call for help. We are very happy to be able to come to the aid of your people. 'Please do give us landing instructions.' 'Over.' - Thank you Dove of Peace. 'Wind, north-northeast.' 'Freshening.' Surely am glad to see you, sir, and, uh, thanks for helping out. We are pleased for the opportunity. Uh, where are your casualties? Look, it's kinda cold talking out here, sir. May we come up? We understand that time is of the essence for your unfortunate casualties. Look, sir, if we came up it would be much easier for us to talk 'and figure this thing out.' This is a strange situation we find ourselves in. Sir, the fact is, we are unable to help you. Now, hold it a minute! We've got some bad casualties. To hell with your casualties. Something's wrong here. Stop the plane. Stop it! Don't you dare. Don't you dare. Don't make me do it again. Don't you dare! No! - Come. Come on, quickly. - What? No questions. Stop. Stop or I will shoot you. Jump. Please, mad doctor. - Turn around. - Easy, fellow, Take it easy. Blanket or coat. Quick, or he'll freeze. Guess, we'll have to hand him back to the Russkies, eh, sir? As soon as we get back to the post we can call the Russian embassy. - Uh-huh. - Uh, just don't try to talk. You'll be okay. Watch it, boys. Watch it. - I'm not a Russian. - A limey, what do you know? What's a limey doin' on a Russian plane? I'm not a Russian. I'm English. I'm a doctor. What are you tryin' to tell us, comrade? I'm English. I'm not a Russian. Take him to the jeep. Hurry up. I'm not a Russian. Say, are you Dr. Jason Love? Yes, I'm Love. I'm Dr. Love. I've got a cable for you, sir marked hold in case of survival. Well, I seemed to have survived. You better read it to me. "Cord LeBaron located Montevideo "suggest you inspect. Stop. "While there, please call manager Pereira Stores "and deliver following message. "Quote. No bananas received this week. Unquote. Signed, Mac." Any reply, doctor? Yes, tell Mac, to take the call..
