This is my wife's story. Naturally this is not it. Neither is this. This is it. The one with that sparkle in her eyes. About 350 babies pass through our nursery. Some are from separate families. Most single mothers. Almost all are adopted within a few weeks of arrival, and they live 12 months with their new families before formal adoption. It's like a love affair. If both parties are happy after a year, they legalize it. For the 350 babies, we received an average of 800 applications. A woman who requests a baby today will have to wait more than three years. That's a lot of time. Is right. Now follow me, please. - He's doing a great job. - Thank you. - You must be very proud. - The credit is not ours. The demand is great. But here is the department in which we are not successful. It has to be possible to find a home for some of them. We would like to find a place for all of them. Our goal is to lose our jobs. It's easy to find a home for blue-eyed blonde girls. But who would want that freckled kid with the protruding teeth? I know he's not very handsome But that does not mean that he is not a child and does not need a home. Nothing happens to them that cannot be arranged with good will. Maybe our Parent-Student Association can do something. We will try to help find a suitable home for them. What's wrong with their houses? I know them all and they are adequate. These kids are much older than ... I also have children, they would be jealous. I would not mind a baby, but a child with the formed character ... It could be a bad influence on your children. Or you could do something to embarrass your entire family. - You are right. - They are right. I have no answers for your objections. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked him. Goodbye and thank you for giving up your Sunday to visit us. Ahead. I would like to help her to lose her job. Don't tell me someone was listening to me. I was not listening. I was observing. Mrs. Rose, you already have three children. It should have been four, but we lost one. Since then we have felt somewhat scarce. What will your husband say? You will love the idea. As soon as I gather the courage to tell him. I have never had a child this way. That I have to do? Choose one? I have one chosen for you. I've been praying that someone would make an offer like yours. Sit down. - We have a real emergency. - An emergency? They just brought us a girl. She has many problems and is disturbed. He tried to commit suicide. Look, all I want is a sweet boy who can play. This girl has suffered year after year of hell. His parents separated. The mother remarried and did not want the girl. She has been beaten and mistreated. Her mother ended up throwing her out of the house and did not let her return. I couldn't take care of that. I'm not ready for that kind of ... You probably need psychological help. He needs a home and a mother to replace what he had. - Mrs. Canyon, I don't think I ... - Mrs. Rose, I've known you for a long time. All the abandoned cats and dogs end up finding their home. He never asks them where they come from. - Let me talk to my husband. - Be convincing. I want this girl to stay with you. You are good at children. It's okay. If your mother is not at home, I guess you can open your birthday present. Excuse me. - A book? -Yes. It is a special book. I have had a hard time finding it. "Complete Poems" by James Wigtown Raleigh. Is that all I'm going to have for my birthday? It contains over a hundred masterpieces, and some rhyme. - Do you want me to read you one? - No. How about "What Old Santa Claus Heard"? "Annie, the little orphan"? - "The Wigwam"? - No. - Why not? - I want you to finish the cake. You do not understand it. It is a deluxe edition. It cost me $ 2.95. Look at what binding. - I'll read you the first page. - Dad, make the cake. Make the cake ... Can't we spend a little time on culture? Take care of this. Daddy, I ordered the basket from Mrs. Turner. - How about the kitten? - He's on it. Pass. Who are you from, puppy? It is not our. Get it out of here. Perhaps it has been lost. Where is it going to go? You can go in peace. We will meet him soon. Come on, puppy, we don't need you to lick the floor. Dad, how can you do such a thing? Where is the basket? Hurry! Here it is, Tim. Is it big enough? Tell that cat to limit production. The first looks like the mother. - Like in this family. - Number one. An only child? What a silly question. - The number two. - Thank you. Number Three. They look like two boys and a girl. - The number four. - Thank you Doctor. Still expect more. - Dad make the cake. - What have you said? - Dad make the cake. - I seemed to have heard that. - The cream needs more sugar. - Thank you. And thank you for this. It is tilted. I want to make a six layer cake that has six layers, not three subdivided layers. Also, when you put the cream on, it will have a perfect finish. Keep leaning. Dad, wait, wait ... if we're going to ... Numbers five, six and seven. They are all different. One is black, one is white, and the other is brown. - What have you said? - Everyone is different. One is black, the other is white, and the other is brown. - That cat must have a bicycle. -Yes. Hi. Pass. How did you get back in here? Come on out. Who has let him in? - It must have been lost. - Let him stay, dad. So sorry. Happy Birthday. Now I know who let him in. Welcome, generous lady. It seemed so lonely ... You have to control your generous impulses. Well, not all. What have you been doing all day? Viewing shop windows. Happy Birthday! There it is again. Wake up, come on. - What happens? - Awake. What did you do with the ladies of the Parents and Students Association? Who? You and the girls. Where did you go? Please... We went to see the children from the orphanage. And did you have a conversation with your friend Mrs. Canyon? I wanted me to ask you about the possibility of adopting a child. He's here, and he's come with the little monster. - But I did tell him to wait! - Well, he didn't understand. Tell him again. That girl has had a very bad time. She is disturbed. Well, I am a disturbed adult. Everyone who can should help. It is a modern way to increase the family. You go to your school and I to mine. Do you think we can afford it? I thought that you would find a way. Where? How? You are married to an engineer on a fixed salary. And fixed increases. Prices rise. If we accept another child in this house, we will deprive our own children of things they deserve. - We'll tighten our belts. - I thought we already did. You haven't bought anything for yourself in years. That robe is older than any of the kids. - I do not care. - Me. And we? Now the children can take care of themselves. We will soon have some time to ourselves again. - I guess you're right. - Anna, I know how you feel. We owe each other, but not this one. And not now. - We better tell him. -Yes. Good Morning. Anna, I hope you understand. He had to come with Jane this morning. - It's a bit early because ... - Wait. Before starting this unfortunate discussion in front of the girl ... Let's go from here. They do not like me. Isn't it better for them to decide? - He told me everything was settled. - I told Mrs. Canyon I'd think about it. Isn't the 8.5 dollars a week of welfare enough? Disturbed? Maybe he could stay with her for two weeks. They wouldn't stay with me for two minutes. Where do we test now? In the zoo? Just a moment. If it's only two weeks ... - You can stay? - Okay... You do not. She. Thanks Anna. Jane, this is Trot, Teenie, and Tim. - Aren't you going to finish? - I'm not that hungry. Well, dinner is over. Brandy and chocolates come later. Everyone to the kitchen to help the butler with the dishes. If you're not going to finish that, you could give it to the dog. - It's a shame to waste it. - Yes ma'am. Go away, asshole. Why is Jane always angry? It feels strange. Give it time. - And then run away. - Father! - This is for Tramp. - I'll give it to him. Prepare your bowl. It looks better than what we've eaten. I don't like that comment. Homeless! - Here comes your food. Thief! - What happen? Man's best friend just ate tomorrow's food. Jane! Why haven't you watched the dog? - He ate the hamburgers. - They should have educated him better. You've already eaten enough. You're going to get sick. You must have the lonely one. Tim, kids, why don't you go play in the living room? Yes. Read Teenie's birthday present. - Poetry? - I do not know how to read. But Tim does. Try it. It will improve your mind. Nothing is wrong with my mind. I just wanted to... I just wanted ... I don't know what I wanted to do. What has become of the children before who brought the pipe and slippers to his father? You're a good boy, daddy. I think I'm going to adopt you. We are going to keep this matter at the husband and wife level. Please. I have to wash the dishes. You always have something to do. Washing dishes, feed the dog, the cat, the children. Have you ever thought that I can be ...? Not only of bread the man lives. You better go see what the kids are up to. How did we get them? Where are the children? Do you want to sweep under the dining room table? The children have left a lot of crumbs. I will not do it. And you have no right to ask me. - I will not do it! - Jane, what's wrong with you? - Is this the poem you were reading? - They were reading it aloud. "Annie, the orphan, came to live in our house ..." I'm not Orphan Annie. I am not an orphan at all. You and your literature ... I will not wash cups and plates, nor will I sweep up crumbs. I will not do it. And no one can force me. Don't talk like that to ... No one is going to force you to do anything you don't want to do. It's just that here we all sweep up our crumbs and we help in everything that has to be done. I thought you might want to help me. That's it. Why should he? If this book bothers you so much, we burn it in the fire. It is not worth arguing for him. So bad. Why not? It's just the $ 2.95 Deluxe Edition. Burn it to see if your silly ideas burn too. But I'm not an orphan! Okay, Dr. Freud, are we finished washing the dishes? The day is over. The children are in bed. Except those kids. Have you put our little gift from heaven to bed? Deluxe Edition... I try to imagine who her parents might have been. - Was John Dillinger married? - Do not be silly. She is not a criminal. She is just a lonely and scared girl. He didn't even want to sleep unless I left the light on. Perhaps he is signaling to an accomplice. That is not funny. That girl has problems. Nothing we do will change it. Dillinger is crying. I'll go see what happens to him. - Don't delay. - Do you want to go to bed, please? - Go away. -Yes. This is women's work. In this house, women's work never ends. It hasn't even started. Why are you crying? Who called you? Nobody. What is this? It's okay. I have taken it. What are you going to do? - You had a good dinner tonight, right? - Is for tomorrow. Why do you think we won't feed you tomorrow? - Why were they going to do it? - Because we want you to be happy. Nobody wants children. They are just something that happens to a woman when she gets married. Do you think we don't want our children? Yes, because they will get in trouble if you don't take care of them. As I gave them to my mother. But they don't have to take care of me. You don't trust anyone, do you? Of course not. - Do you trust yourself? - What does it mean? Well ... I mean ... If you could take care of yourself if you didn't have to depend on other people's kindness, Would you feel safer? How am I going to take care of myself? Maybe I could find you a job. What work could I do? Okay... Maybe you could help out at the grocery store after school. Or maybe a neighbor would hire you to take care of their children. And safe. - Do I leave this here? - No. You're welcome. How long is that girl going to be with you? We have twelve days of sentence left, but if we are lucky it may kill us all first. I don't know how your wife has convinced mine To let that girl take care of our baby Remember, Harry: the women of this world they are always noble, altruistic and trustworthy. Let's toast not to be like them. The baby will probably sleep all the time. We'll be back in time for your ten o'clock bottle. - What if they're late? - We will be here. Don't worry, Jane. The movie ends at half past nine. If we haven't returned by ten, there are two bottles with your preparation in the fridge. We will be here. Come on, Harry. We don't want to be late to the movies. Gladys, I hope you know what you're doing. Do not worry. Jane is a very competent girl. So was Lucrezia Borgia. I'll take a look to see if everything goes well. - It was a wonderful movie. - Yes, wonderful. - Can't you go faster? - Faster? It's okay. Let me know when we get to the end of the road. And have they had to push it two kilometers? I feel sorry for you guys. Two or three cars arrive like this every night. - Please. -Yes. - My wife used the car ... - Yes, they all say the same thing. - Does not answer. - Not...? - And good? - Does not answer. Get in the car, Harry. You will see that melancholic girl. - All good? - Yes, good. Wait a minute, 12 liters are missing. - Where is? - You have searched all the drawers. The baby! The baby is missing! I'll call the police. Put down the phone and come to the kitchen. Come Daddy. Come, Gladys. Thank God. I guess you have looked everywhere to find the formula. Why haven't you used the bottles that were there? That's the shelf you fixed this morning. - You've earned your dollar. - We better put him to bed. This is Jane Miller, a friend of mine. You want to open an account. - How are you Miss Miller? - Good. Do you want to sit down? - Savings or business account? - Commercial. You have opened a business and want to have your capital on hand. Does that mean I can get it out quickly? At the slightest sign of disaster. Sign there, Jane. How much will your first deposit be? One dollar. - What's wrong with Teenie? - Nothing, mom. I'm just practicing first aid. Do not move. I can not. I have a fractured left clavicle, dislocated third vertebra and second degree burns to the buttocks. - That's the worst place. - Yes, and it does not cooperate. Doctor, remove the bandages from the patient and put him to bed. Don't forget to turn off the light. I don't want to see that dog in bed in the morning. Good night, Tramp. By the way, Jane and I went to the bank this morning. You have opened an account. I am glad that someone in this house is financially independent. Where is? Yes, Mrs. Canyon. Row in the boat, carried by the current, happy, happy ... Life is a dream. Take a look. There it goes. Can't wait to get it served? I believe that an omelette should be the size of the pan. It takes more skill than most mortals. But I studied under the orders of the best chefs. Oscar, the hotel cook. Here you go, Teenie. And my uncle Jim. Yours is coming right away, Trot. What you do not finish you can use as a hat. - Who was calling? - I'll tell you after breakfast. We may not be alive after this breakfast. - You better tell us now. - Come on, tell us. Who was? Well ... it was Mrs. Canyon. Help her pack. But, Jane is staying with us, right? You don't have to go, do you? I'm doing yours, Trot. I'm not hungry. You can eat mine. - Here's my notebook. - I'll put it on top. I do not want it. It's for you. I know that I have cost him more than the social assistance they gave him. I cannot accept this. Here's more than five dollars. You said you must learn to be independent. Not to depend on the kindness of others. Not even yours. Well thank you very much. This balances the accounts. We can go. What a trick! Take it away. Better not. Maybe they don't like cats where I go. What a bummer. I do not want to go! Please let me stay. I'm sorry. Come on, Mrs. Canyon. Wait. Where is my bag? Town Hall Engineering. This is Desmond Duran. I'll check it out and call you back. Where is Mr. Rose this time? Taking a cigarette? Drinking water? Washing the hands? Tell me, am I getting closer? He had to go down to the pharmacy. He has cut his finger. When you come out of anesthesia, tell him I want to see you. Mission accomplished. Where is the curmudgeon? At his office. Drinking blood. Where were you? Looking for discounts. War supplies. The self-inflating rubber boat. Sleeping bag. The volleyball ball. Why are you hiding them? - What have you said? - Why are you hiding them. So that the curmudgeon doesn't remember I'm going on vacation tomorrow. Where are you going? We have rented a cabin in Michigan this summer. You will not succeed. He will notice that you are happy. And I was already looking for you. You must have work for the night. It's not that bad. I wouldn't do that. When he read "Uncle Tom's Cabin" he thought Simon Legree was the hero. Well, how about the finger? - They saved him. - Good. So there's no reason why I can't work in reviewing these plans. Tonight. That tells me? Well, casca ... Mr. Duran, I'm sorry. Right now I have some work pressure. I thought that job was done. Well, it grows. It is getting bigger and bigger. Always the same. When there is a rush job there are always excuses. Instead, if they want to sneak out to drink water, if they want to go have a cigarette, if they want to go shopping or to heal a finger, they go away immediately, right? Before he goes rowing. It seems to work. I'm almost done. Lay down. I'll go in a couple of minutes. - It is day? - It usually happens every 24 hours. Do you want to stop now? As soon as this is over. I have 10 or 15 minutes left. Kids, dad is working. We are going to leave him alone. All shut up. Come into the kitchen, let's go. - Go putting breakfast. - Yes, mother. Without the slightest complaint. If Jane handles the kids like that on the beach, we can have a second honeymoon. There is something I tried to tell you last night ... No hurry. Go back to your duties. - I think you should know ... - Come on, go, I have to finish. Cold. What did dad say? - I couldn't tell you. - There will be fireworks. Kittens, kittens ... - They are no longer kittens. They're cats. - They're cats. Teenie, please take this cup of coffee to daddy. We want you to be happy. I have burned. Go away. So much coffee is not good. You take too much. It makes you nervous. You should drink milk. Do you burn me alive and criticize me? Get me a glass of cold water. Does not matter. I'll go. I want it to be cold. - Do not be angry. - OK OK. We just wanted to put you in a good mood. Why? So we can tell you about the child we're taking to the beach. What a child? He's a poor orphan. We are going to pick you up at summer school. Because Mrs. Canyon says ... - Do not say more. - I could not refuse. Well I do. I do. Those are all I want to see when I get back. - What is your name? - These are your papers. Is named... James. Yes, James John Wilson. Jimmy John. I already remember. Mr. Rose, is something wrong with your wife? Naturally. She came to ask about him and I tried to discourage her. But when I told him he was surly, bad And the worst student in summer school her eyes seemed to sparkle. - I know that glitter. I don't like leaving no child without a vacation, but in this case I think you do well not to take it. I'll go see him. What class are you in? At 403. Silence please. Jimmy John. Come here. You can't teach him much. He only attends for 5 minutes. - And he has a very bad temper. - Really? He puts his legs up for the other children to trip over, and then hits them. He doesn't even want to learn the alphabet at his age. So I punished him for sitting under my table. Do you know what he did the other day? He bit my ankle. Sister, I would have bit him on both ankles. Come on, kid. Row, row your boat gently down the current, happy, happy, happy, life is a dream. Row, row your boat gently down the current, happy, happy, happy, life is a dream. Come, come, come, get on our boat, cheerfully, cheerfully, go with the flow. Come, come, come, get on our boat, cheerfully, cheerfully, go with the flow. Fun for everyone singing a song, cheerfully, cheerfully, while we paddle. Fun for everyone singing a song, cheerfully, cheerfully, while we paddle. What's wrong with your voice, Jimmy John? I don't think he has a voice. He hasn't said a word yet. Is asleep. Come on, wake up. Still, still. Wait. No one is hit here. Teenie, you go back. Johnny, you in front with me. - Come on, throw it at me. - I always throw it at you. Throw the ball to us. Come on, throw it away. - Ready? I take out. - It doesn't always touch you. Let's have a game. That's what we are doing, right? Something has to happen to that ... what's his name? Jimmy John. I have the impression that nothing is wrong with him. You had the impression that our cat was a male. - How about a walk? - I have to put him to bed first. You had a rough day. You're not going to put him with Tim. There may be a bloodbath. No. We have to give him a quarter, it is a regulation of the Social Council. Well, you will have to think about building it, because there isn't. We are going to give you our room. So sorry. Where are we going to spend the second honeymoon? On our raft? I'll sleep in the girls' room. And you with Tim and Teenie. Yes? We have the right to be together. Okay, but it's not fair that you serve with your left. I dont know. Do you want to say good night to the children? It says "good night". - Come on. - You get it, Tim. Don't serve like that. 21-19. We have won. - Give us revenge. - You should do something, daddy. - That kid is missing a screw. - Yes, and a nut too. - He's just scared. - With a left-hander like that? Do you mind if I give it some? Give it to me. Behind. Now you will see how a champion comes out. You keep watching us. I think you will end up liking us. What's wrong? If you can cry, you can talk. What's wrong? Get out, Tim. Nice shot, Teenie. We are doing well. I can do something? Why was he screaming? Has been in hospitals since the age of two, in large rooms with other children, with nurses coming and going. He has never been alone in a room. Maybe it would be better for him if we took him back. Should we give up now? I suppose not. We enter? Do you want to take him? It's too heavy for me. Dad, are you going to sleep with us? It seems to have been so decided. We have drawn lots. You get the top one. Goodnight. Jimmy John, why don't you put on your swimsuit? I'll take you on the boat. It is useless talking to him, he never opens his mouth. A cat ate his tongue. - Where are you taking it? - Who knows! Row, row your boat ... Row, row your boat gently in the current, cheerfully, cheerfully ... You know how to drive? You know how to drive? Don't be there like an idiot, because I know you are not. I will ask you one more time and I hope you will speak. You know how to drive? Of course not, don't be silly. Well, nothing like learning right now. He wants to kill me? Take the wheel. Catch it! They will put her in jail for letting a child drive. - You're doing it right. - I'm scared. It's okay. I'll take the wheel. Whoops! - I've done well, right? - Perfect. - Is not easy. - Of course not. And I have. You have done it very well. You can go back to practicing another day. If he did not speak before, it is not because he was angry. He just had nothing to say. Well, that will be a lesson for me. Ma'am, could you not learn to swim like other children? - Best. - Then turn around and take me there. You could also use classes. Dad, look. Look! I'm out of here. I'm scared. There are too many waves for me. You're good. Let's go. There is no reason to be afraid. Put me back in. Let's go! The water is very good. There is nothing to be afraid of. What Happened to Silent Sam? Why didn't he speak? Don't be silly, I had nothing to say. - Let's go. - Yeah come on. - Don't let me go. - I will not do it. And as I catch you again ... - What happen? - Nothing. Only I'm going to tell my mother. Quiet. What happened? - Ask him. - Come on, let's go. - What happened to your hand? - I've hurt. - How? - I got caught with the window. - What were you doing up there? - I just wanted to open the blinds. - How old are you? - Twelve. Enough. Come here. Partner. Watch this. - This is a woman. - I already know that. What I want to know is how children are born. So this is an advanced class. Do you know how chickens and birds lay eggs? - No. - They put them in the nest. And they keep them warm with their feathers, until the chicks hatch and hatch. - I didn't come out of an egg. - No. That doesn't work with people. What if people sat on the eggs waiting for them to hatch? - They would break them. - Well of course. - Besides, who has feathers? - Nobody in our environment. Instead, the women have the nest inside, where the eggs are warm and safe. And when the baby has grown, it is born whole. So. Good system. I'm glad you approve it so we don't have to change it. But how do babies get in there? How do they breathe? Let me think. Do you know how a diver breathes through a tube? Well, it reaches the baby in a similar way, but through an artery. You'll see, blood carries oxygen through the artery to the baby. The mother's heart is the pump. It could work. But how do they connect the tube to the baby? He's not wearing a diving helmet, is he? No. It goes into the baby's navel. Like a cord in a socket. That's what your belly button was for. I had always wondered what he was doing there. Yes? You already know it. Can I join you or am I too small? He was talking about babies. - He's a nice guy. - Yes? When I have asked other people, they washed my mouth with soap. - Thank my Lord. - You're welcome. Wait until we get to the stork. Now that is interesting. What is that supposed to be? A woman. - It doesn't look like much. - I drew it from memory. Ready to go hiking? Jane! - Hi, Ben. - Hello. Come on, I'll take you. Who wears Jimmy John? He is too old to ride a bike. We can't take it. Tim, if you weren't ... How about you let Jimmy John ride? Let it climb. If you learn to pedal, it can help. I would like this to be a happy family. Let everyone talk to everyone. I have to get back to work soon. Try putting your foot on the pedal. Loosen the screws. Can you put your foot on the other pedal? Already? Let's go. Easy, relax. You just have to hold on tight to the handlebars. You are doing it very well. - I was hooked. - What had he told you? Get me out of here! Jimmy John! Stop! Get me out of here. Can I get my bike before it breaks the chains? It weighs, right? Give it to your mother. Come on, partner. Come on, Tim. Hurry up. We don't have all day. Ben, don't try to go without hands. Not so fast, Benjy. I'll fall. - Let's go to the baseball field. - We are not enough. There are always a lot of kids to play baseball. Jimmy John, you have to say goodbye. - I have to return? - We have tried. But you don't get along with children. After all, it's their home, and they don't want you. If they say I can stay, will they accept it? Didn't you break Tim's bike? Didn't you hit Trot in the eye? Weren't you caught looking out a window? But if they let me? We will wait for you in the car. I hope you have a good lawyer. What are you saying? - Shall we do the secret ballot? - Good idea. What's that secret ballot thing? We all write "stay" or "go" on a piece of paper. And most win. - Nice dress you are wearing. - Shut up. That's what I say. Come on, open them. GO AWAY. GO AWAY. GO AWAY What is the verdict? I've been so long in fucking hospitals I can't even read But you went to school, right? They took me to school for a couple of weeks and then they would take me back to a hospital. The only thing I learned to read was a thermometer. I will read them to you. "Stay". "Stay". "Stay". - We stay with Jimmy John. - We stay with him. What did I tell them? Everyone has voted that I stay. - Wait, here it says ... - They were anonymous. Of course, they were anonymous ... And what did you vote for? The first day after returning from the beach, Anna got a manicure and went to the hair salon. I guess he didn't want me to keep drawing from memory. Mother, you've been to the hairdresser. It was time. You always go so disheveled. - What is this? - The ranch. The boy scouts are gathering here tonight. Boy scout meeting on the first day back home? Rest. Your poor father has been here alone while we enjoyed the beach. And now... - OMG! - Get it off me! - Squeeze the heel, toes back. - You're going to break my foot. Do you want to tiptoe the rest of your life? - If you continue like this, I'll walk on my knees. - What did they tell you at the hospital? The muscles in your feet are stiff. You have to stretch them. It is killing me. He pulls on my legs like he wants to rip them off. - I think enough is enough for today. - I think so. Plus it's time for your reading lesson. - Here's the book. - Who wants to read? Don't you want to know as much as the other kids in your class? - They dont know anything. - Well believe me, If you don't learn to read, you won't know anything either. It starts there. "Long time ago"... - Do not stop. - "there was a", "there was a" ... What word is this? - "Little bunny". - Little bunny... - I'm not going to read any more. - You are going to do it. - I want to go to the kitchen. - As soon as you finish this book. It's okay. I'll finish him off. Brat. Come here! What happened? What are you doing to him? What I should have done before. I shouldn't have asked to stay. I'm going! I will go where I want and do what I want. Then do it. But drop everything we've given you. And you get out of the way, Tramp. Mom, come quickly. Has done... What happens now? - Look. - Oh my! He goes naked. Jimmy John! What are you doing? He told me not to take anything with me. Well, I have nothing. Just my skin. I should not have said that. But why did you tear the book? I won't read about a bunch of stupid rabbits in blue pants who speak like people. It's silly. You're right, it's silly. We will find something better. Hurry up I am freezing. Scouts, rest. - Hello, Mr. Rose. - Hello Benjamin, gentlemen. Break ranks. Is the meeting over? As soon as we see some movies from our summer camp. It won't be long. You have been very kind to let us use your living room. We have always held our meetings at school, but they are having a raffle. And what do they raffle? Boy scouts? - Dad, mom is upstairs. - It's the place to be. Sorry to come between you and donuts, but that's life. Anna, who told those scouts ...? Look what mother bought me. A real suit, like yours. You have been invited to the meeting. My legs are as straight as anyone's. The apparatus is barely visible. - Nobody will notice, right? - No one can tell. - Why is this? - For being a good mother. All right, Jimmy John, not everyone knows how to fall like this. That's the way, you have to let yourself fall. - I'll do it again from above. - No, we're going to see the movies. - What are the movies about? - From the camp. I'll turn the lights off. Put the movie on. This is our first treasure hunt. Where Chief Johnson mistook an oak for an elm and got lost. If he hadn't located that stream, it would still be there. A compass is very useful on a scavenger hunt. Alone at last. The last boy scout and the last donut have disappeared into the night. Are you sure we can afford that? I've been saving for weeks. - Wake up, wake up. - What happens? Tim gave me the boy scout manual. I have to read it. Teach me. - Now? - Now. From the beginning to the end. Can I have my jacket, please? - Thank you. - You're welcome. "On my honor, I will do my best ... for fulfilling my duty towards God and towards my country, to obey the scout law, and to help everyone at all times. " Goodnight. "To keep me physically strong, mentally awake and morally healthy. " Do a good deed for the day. "Raising an adopted child can be fun." If you have any questions, I will gladly answer them. Is there a reason why these children were not legally adopted? Of course. If we adopt them, we will be responsible for all their expenses. Hospital bills, operations, dentists. And we can't afford it. In this way, with the help of the social commission, taking advantage of the clothes of our older children, and with the help of our neighbors, we managed to get ahead. Sometimes we have to add a little water to the soup, but thus we preserve the figure. But also having children of her own, I don't know how he manages to take care of them and also take care of the house. I'll tell you my secret: I don't put the duster on the furniture. Wouldn't you rather raise a baby than a grown, troubled child? No, because we have already had the satisfaction of our babies. Everybody knows how to avoid scratching but these children pose an interesting challenge. Don't you think that by accepting this interesting challenge may you be neglecting your husband? In what sense? How many senses are there? I assure you that any inconvenience that it may have caused is temporary. How long is "temporary"? - Young man ... - Thank you. - Are you married? - How? Stronger, please. - Are you married? - Sometimes I'm asking. Well, I'll tell you something about my husband. Our children are very interested in him. He is reasonably patient, fair and firm. He always enthusiastically helps them overcome their difficulties. He's the first one they go to when they need help with their homework or a new catcher for the baseball team. And when they get something they run to him to show him. Because he always receives it with joy and pride. Has constant love and affection of all members of the family, including his wife. And you ask me if you're being careless? It was a great year for the Boy Scouts. When the holidays came again, it fell to me to stay physically strong, mentally awake and financially sunk. Do you see what I see? A rabbit! Hold the bike, Tim. - Mrs. Rose ... - Yes? At the risk of being presumptuous, can you tell me what you're doing? This poor rabbit needs somewhere to sleep. As far as I know, rabbits have no trouble sleeping. How did it get here? They had him in a box at the market and they were going to kill him. - I could not avoid it. - And your eyes started to shine. I only paid 42 cents. Very cheap. It is to eat, not to shelter you. If you want to enlarge the house, Why don't you build a cabin for you and me? Behold! Jimmy John is riding. I guess he won't break this bike. I'll go get Herbie some lettuce. I have a little. Surprised? You see, she was under the impression that this rabbit was male. Daddy, dinner is ready. If you're interested. I'm going. Who? Yes, Mrs. Canyon. No, Mrs. Canyon, we're full. It's going to be fun, a good excursion. And without the gadgets. - Next week? - I think so. Teenie, it's your turn. We thank you for what we are going to eat. Amen. Why didn't you say: ready, set, go? - Hi, Jane. Where were you? - Where it always is. With Ben. He doesn't even go to scout meetings anymore. I hate it. I never want to see him again. - What have you done? - He invited me to the end of the year dance. The end of the year dance? Since when is that a crime? Where do you live, on the moon? Dancing is "just" the biggest party in school. So why did you bother Jane? Because it's "just" the New Years Eve dance and "just" is elegant and "only" you have to wear an evening dress. Jane doesn't even have a day outfit. Next time Mrs. Canyon leaves a girl around here, make sure it comes classy. It's okay. Let's go. I'm going there! - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas, Dad. 1,2,3 ... Come on! No! Just a moment. No Please! No, leave them. Before we throw ourselves on the spoils, Shouldn't we get into the spirit of this day? Children, we better give up or we lose the whole day. "Good King Wenceslas". "Merry Christmas, good King Wenceslas." - It's all he can play. - Let's hear him, okay? Now we will sing "Good King Wenceslas". Good King Wenceslas looked out the window on Steven's day when the snow had fallen covering everything with a crisp blanket. The moon was shining that night, although the cold was intense, when a poor man appeared who collected firewood for the winter. Second stanza. Hey, page, come here, if you know, tell me, that peasant, who is he? Where and how do you live? Lord, live far from here, on a mountain, near the edge of the forest ... Everyone to open their gifts. Look how big mine is! It probably contains nothing but money. You would be surprised if it were an evening dress. All right, kill me. Is beautiful. But it's yours. I don't have many occasions to use it, so I have cut it for you. Thank you mother. Why don't you try it on? Try it on. Trot and I will help you. A hunting knife! Thank you. A microscope! I've always wanted one. Look what they put on me. A real camera. - Where is the reel? - Next Christmas. Look at everyone. Look at Jane. Is very pretty. - It fits you well. - It is awful. Is beautiful. It still looks like Mom's old dress, cut out for you. Teenie is right. But we hoped it was worth it. It is wonderful. I do not care. We just have to tuck it in a little more and shorten it. It will be the most beautiful dress at the dance. - It's still horrible. - Teenie! Jane and I saw a dress in a shop window the other day, but it was $ 25. You better return this. I could cut myself. I don't think I know how to use this. You better pay it back and use the money elsewhere. It is not good for much without a reel. - Here, daddy. - Thanks, Trot. Okay. Merry Christmas, anyway. Merry Christmas, Dad. - What happens? - You have to stop him. - How? - You have to stop him. - To who? - Jimmy John. Do you know the temperature what it does? I have left the thermometer in my other pajamas. Two below zero. You can't go hiking today. - Who? - Jimmy John. You already know Jimmy John. He's hell-bent on earning that scout medal. If you go out in this weather, it will hurt your legs and you can lose everything you have gained. Wake up. They never gave me a medal for anything in the middle of the night. - Hurry up. - It's still dark out there. Gone an hour ago. If I was going to do 15 kilometers, I had to get up early. Why haven't you stopped it? Isn't it worth being the best boy scout? Not for Jimmy John. I thought we were going to buy the dress. We are going in the opposite direction. There is. Jimmy, are you okay? Haven't you read that poster? Parking prohibited on the road. Do you accept that I drive you part of the way? It was a mistake. Let's buy that dress again. Ben is going to pass out when he sees you. Daddy, what time is it? Do you want to stop worrying? It's not even half past seven. Not even? He left at five thirty in the morning. And it's already dark. Nothing happens. Take my signal flashlight. You see it? There is no need to worry. Take Tim's signal flashlight. Come on, Tramp. We're going for a walk. What have you said? I'm just going for a walk with the dog. Any objection? No, but we've had that dog for a long time And you've never taken it for a walk It is time for me to take the air. Come on, Tramp. You're wanting it. You see it? Hurry up with the soup, Jimmy John. Tell us more. - Teenie. - I know, it's time to go to bed. I'll upload it. Come on, Teenie. After the first nine or ten kilometers, the trick is not to sit down, because you couldn't get up. The channel next year? Do not tell her. He is capable of trying. - Whoops! Who is she? - Do you like it? Will you sign an autograph for me? "Nice to see you." - You are precious. - But don't breathe too deeply. That must be Benjy. In the words of George Bernard Shaw: "Youth is such a wonderful thing that it is a shame to waste it on children." Benjy? Yes, I am Jane. Could I speak to him? I get it. Thanks for calling. Well, what time is that boy coming to pick you up? Are you ready for printing? You better return this dress. - What happens? - It was his mother. Says Benjy has a cold. What a pity. He has no cold. She doesn't want her to go out with me because I'm not really your daughter. How do you know? Last night Benjy told me that his mother wanted to know more about my parents. Well forget it, you'll go to the dance with someone else. I can't carry her, she's older than me. Besides, I don't have a suit. You have the new blue suit and it's only three years out of you. Mom, I'll be the only one. If I take my dress off now, maybe they'll give you your money back. We cannot return it. We have adjusted it. I can't dance, but I'll take you. You stay there. I'll be fixed in five minutes. - Where are you going? - I have to cure a cold. Cheer up. - Goodnight. - Mr. Rose ... - Is your mother there? - Yes, my father too. - Well, I want to see you both. - I don't want to miss this. - Listen to me, Mrs. Roberts ... - Mr. Rose, no ... Goodnight. I have come up with a prepared speech about Jane. He was going to call him a few things before punching him in the nose. - Don't get excited. - Yes, good. None of that matters now. The important thing is that there is a girl who is going to her first dance with a short companion dressed in a blue suit. This is a tragedy, Mr. Roberts. So if you, as the head of the family, He doesn't care, I'd like to take this tall young man in a suit to the dance and fix things for her. I'm very sorry to tell you ... Shut up, Grace. I don't know how your presence can mend a broken heart, but go. - Thanks Dad. - Time to go, Benjy. - Don't wait up, Mrs. Roberts. - It will not. It is going to be a surprise. - Where's Jane? - Over there. I haven't been able to get close to her since I arrived. I do not remember well. You have two dances and you have three. I will dance with you. Sorry. He has seen me. May I have this dance? - Hey, Tim ... - Sorry, I don't dance. Will old friends be forgotten and never remembered? Will old friends from the old days be forgotten? Happy New Year, Jane. Happy new year, daddy. For the good old days, dear, for the old days. We will start the meeting by declaring allegiance to the flag. I declare my fidelity to the flag from the United States of America and the republic that it represents, an indivisible nation, with freedom and justice for all. Remove the flags. Explorers and guests can sit. Tonight he honors us with his presence the Mayor of our city, the Honorable Michael J. Cane. Before the court of honor awards the decorations, I want to ask the audience to avoid applause for individual explorers. Our program is very long and we want to speed it up. Thank you. Howard Williams, rookie scout candidate. Donald Sherwood, candidate for second scout. And now the highest honor of the explorers, the Eagle medal, which is part of the treasure at the end of the scout rainbow. James John Wilson, candidate for the Eagle medal. Have designated scouts escort the laureate to the stand. Let the designated scouts escort your parents here. May the laureate and the scoutmaster follow me. I ask you to reaffirm the oath of the explorers with your master. For my honor I will do my best to fulfill my duty to God and my country and to obey the scout law, help all people at all times, and stay physically strong, mentally awake, and morally just. By the power vested in this court by the National Council of Boy Scouts of America, we awarded the Eagle Scout medal, James John Wilson. Do parents want to get behind their child? Does the mother want to impose the medal on her son? The explorer will impose on his mother a miniature eagle. In memory of this solemn but happy occasion, the court invites the father to present an American rose to his wife. The Eagle ceremony is over and the session adjourns. Speak. Come on, Jimmy, say something. You'll have to say something, Jimmy, or we'll never go home. Well, I've had a lot of help. And I've had an advantage over you guys. I have had the opportunity to choose my parents. Don't bother Ben's parents or they won't invite you again. The Roberts have been kind enough to invite you over for the night, right? I feel so lonely without them. I do not know what I'm going to do. I do. "Do one good deed a day." Have I ever dared to tell you that I love you? I don't remember hearing it in recent years. We have been so busy raising children that I have not had time. But I love you very much, Mrs. Rose.
