Step on my back. - Here I come. - Dad, take my hand. Excuse me. Hello. - Yes? - I'm sorry, but… I was visiting my mother-in-law, and I lost my wallet here at the rest stop. Or maybe someone stole it. So? Why are you telling us this? Well, my family needs to get home, but we're out of gas. If you could lend me 20,000 won, I'll wire you the money as soon as I get home. Sorry, but I don't have any cash. Dad, when are we going home? I want to go home. I said to wait in the car. Why did you come out? - 20,000 won? - Yes. You use mobile payment, right? Oh, no.

What do we do now? Everything will work out somehow. Seriously. Seriously. Stop it. Mom, what are you eating? What? I'm not eating anything. - Why aren't you sleeping? - My back hurts. Your back will hurt if you believe it hurts. It won't hurt if you believe it doesn't hurt, okay? Eun-yi, I'm hungry. Believe you're not hungry, and you won't be. Eun-yi. Eat this. Excuse me.

Can you move this please? Okay, let's eat. Thank you Jesus and Buddha for letting us eat again today. - Here. - Looks yummy. Here, Eun-yi. If you look at them like this, you can tell whether or not they're nice. I can tell right away if I look. I don't understand. What do you mean? What I'm saying is we need to approach someone who looks nice. - Are you hot? - What? No. This is a pill bug. Good boy. Keep your eyes closed. More. Brainy, look! I don't have any cash. If you could lend me just 20,000 won… Where do you live? Well… In Masan. Masan? Where in Masan? In Hakjeong-dong. Do you know Masan well? You can't make it there with 20,000 won. - Yes, we can. - Where's your car? Our car? Over there. Let me see your ID. I don't have my ID. I lost my wallet. I don't have any cash. Sorry. Wait. Sir. If you'd lend me a small amount, I can wire you the money. - I'm leaving. Ask someone else. - Please help me out. Hey, kid. Don't drink that water. Excuse me. Hello. Yes? The thing is I lost my wallet. Could you lend me 20,000 won? Sorry, but I'm busy. Can you help us please? We were visiting my mother-in-law, and someone must've stolen my wallet. I can't find it anywhere. Where do you live? - Yeongcheon. - In Gyeongbuk? Do you know Yeongcheon? I lived there briefly as a child. It's so great to meet you. We're from the same hometown. Gosh. Thank you. - Thank you. - Thank you. The kids haven't eaten all day. I should've been more careful. I'm sorry. - Thank you very much. - Thank you. Wait. It's okay. Take it. No, ma'am. It's okay. 20,000 won is plenty for gas to get us home. I'll wire you the money as soon as I get home. It's okay. Take it. You don't have to give us so much money. You said the kids haven't eaten all day. It's fine. Take it. Take it. - Thank you. - Thank you. Go eat. I'll go now. - Thank you. - Sure. What is it? You didn't give me your account number. - It's okay. - No. Please. My account number is on the back. - Thank you! Have a nice day. - Thank you. - Bye. - Have a nice day. Bye! Looks like the fly likes you. Step aside. I told you to take this down yesterday. Step aside. Wait. The fucking laws in this country… Sir, aren't you a government worker? Shouldn't a government worker work for the citizens? We're just innocent citizens resting here at this rest stop. - What law did we break? - I'll tell you what law. The Tourism Promotion law, Article 3, Section 1. As you're in violation of it, I will remove the illegally installed structure. - Fine, I'll take it down. - Seriously! I said to take it down yesterday! You should've listened when I was being nice! There are people in here. This is all of you, right? I'm going to take this down, okay? Seriously! Don't touch that! Don't touch that! - What's wrong with you? - Get off me! What's wrong with you? - Sir, let go. - You jerk! Seriously. What's wrong with you? Did you just shove me? I'm calling the cops. Wait right there. What? When did I shove you? Oh, no. It broke. - Where's my phone? - Shit! Move! Shit! It broke! What do we do? Did it really break? Don't glare at me like that. - It broke because he pushed me! - You broke it. Hey, why are you crying? It's okay. I'll fix it. It's okay. Don't cry. It looks… Darn it. Stay still. Seocheon Service Area is the closest, right? Yes, it is. I don't want to walk anymore. My legs hurt. I'm not walking. Taek, we've been here too long. It's time to go on a trip. I don't want to walk! - Where are you going? Taek! - Taek! Eun-yi, go get Taek. Ouch! My legs hurt! My legs hurt! Eat this. - Is it good? - Yes. What is this? My tooth fell out. It's not the first time. Stop crying. My tooth hurts and my legs hurt! I'll trade you for that tooth. Give me one more. Thanks for everything. Look over there. All those TV stations filmed here. We've been in business for 41 years. It's a good thing we're closing shop. Many businesses are clinging on as they have no choice. This place used to get so packed. Ma'am, look at this. - We're taking this too, right? - Yes. - Ma'am. - Once we are done, let's have blood sausage soup today. No. Let's have ox blood soup. There's a famous carpenter named Park. - He hammered it by hand. - Let's carry at least two at a time. - It's top-quality handmade. - Right. Excuse me, sir. Should we take these too? I guess not. Sir. Just take them. Why? Take this. It'd be a waste not to. It's fine. Give me a little more. This isn't right. You know it costs an arm and a leg to throw all of this out, don't you? You have to get permits and schedule pick-ups. - That costs much more. - I know that, but… Then what? Should we unload them and leave? Hold on. So? Are we unloading everything? Forget it. Go up and get the rest. Tseten, go and get them. FOR RENT Buy yourself some cigarettes. She's here. - Hello. - Hello. - There's a lot of stuff. - Yes. Take your time and look around. Let me know if you need anything. Many people use these as shelves. - They put random stuff on them. - I see. There's nothing wrong with them, is there? I need to buy a lot of stuff. Seriously, that hurts my feelings. Do you know how much it costs to bring these here? Try shopping online or at IKEA. - We're much cheaper. - That's true, but… I checked everything thoroughly and washed and polished them. I'm really hurt. You took all the best stuff. This really is cheaper than shopping online. Of course. We have the lowest prices in the country. Come by when we open. Fine. I'll go and have some of your blood sausage soup. Tseten! - Yes? - You love sausage soup, right? Yes, I do. - We need to deliver 12 chairs. - Sure. Want to check out the warehouse? We have a lot there too. I spent so much already. We just unloaded those but they're sold already. We just unloaded them but they're sold. Funny, right? That's life. You never know what will happen. Are you tired, Eun-yi? Yes, I'm tired. Mom is carrying your little sibling in her belly. She must be so happy that you're helping her like this. Sorry, Eun-yi. Thanks. It's okay. You can do it. Right? You can do it. You can do it. Why would I snip my dick again? - I got circumcised as a teenager. - Seriously. Anyway, I could tell that they were con artists. Total con artists. So I told them to scram. Yeah, right. That's why you sold all of that for so cheap? I didn't sell them for cheap. I charged them the full amount. I didn't leave anything out. Isn't that right, Tseten? Right? Answer quickly. Yes. What do you mean "Yes"? He didn't, did he? Yes, yes. Do you say "Yes" to everything? Say yes in Jongno Say yes in Euljiro Cheongnyangni. Say yes, yes, yes, yes In Cheongnyangni Hey. What are you doing? Don't feed them. They'll keep coming back. What? Who? What else? The animals will keep coming. That cat will keep coming. What's wrong with that? What's wrong with feeding the cat? It's okay, Young-sun. Look. It likes it. We should all share. Don't be like that. Now that I look at it, it is cute. Sure, we should all share. - That's right. We should share. - It's all good. Tseten! Come have some of this too. - Come here. - Yes, sir. Let's hear Tseten sing. - No? - I'm going to lie down. - Why? - Why? I must've drunk too much. I'm dizzy. Call me when you're done. I'll help clean up. - But… - Should I get you some medicine? No, it's fine. Keep eating. Get some sleep. - Is she sick? - I'll wake you up when we're done. CHEONGBUK FURNITURE THRIFT STORE Sing for us. Along Soyang River Right on. It really does sound like that. You're really something. It's been so long already. Thinking about him and missing him won't bring the kid back to life. You know I'm right. Why can't you understand? What don't I understand? But a married couple should be intimate. That's natural. That way love can heal the pain and stuff like that. - Am I right? - Damn it. You… Forget it. I'll stop. Honey. Tseten. He asked for a raise. Why? You know that old lady who owns the place he rents? She wants to raise his rent by 50,000 won or something. Tell him to sleep in the room at the store. That works too. But you know… he must like living together with his own people. Will you give him the raise? Tell him we'll give him a raise next month. All right. I'll tell him you said that. Good night. Eun-yi, what are you doing there? - Mom, didn't you hear that? - Hear what? It's just the wind. Let's go. Eun-yi, it's okay. Is anyone home? Nope. Eun-yi, Taek, be careful. Isn't it nice? Let's go up this way. Let's go! Careful. Be careful, okay? This way. Come up. This is good. This is nice. What do you think? It's nice, right? Yes. Fist bump. All right. Why? What's wrong? - What's wrong, Eun-yi? - Water. Water. It's raining. Rain? It's raining. Move. - Are you okay, Mom? - Yes, I'm okay. I'll hug you too. Oh, Sariputra. Everything is empty. Nothing is born and nothing dies. Nothing is stained and nothing is pure. Nothing increases and nothing decreases. Therefore… in emptiness there is no form, feeling, perception, impulse, or consciousness. Hey, Sin-woo. I told you over and over not to wear this. Why? I like it. I bought you a new shirt yesterday. It looks nice and neat. I'm just hanging out with my friends. - Go and change. - Gosh, you're such a nag. Bye, Mom. I told you to change. No! Hey! Your lunch. You forgot your lunch! Excuse me. - Hello. - Yes? I'm sorry, but I was on my way home from visiting my mother-in-law… Did he go home and come back? If you'd lend me just 20,000 won, I'll wire you the money as soon as I get home. Wow. Thank you. - Have a nice day. - You too. You're clear! Keep going! Have a nice day! Goodness. Gosh. Why did I throw this away? - Blue skies, Milky Way - Blue skies, Milky Way Rock, paper, scissors, say shoot. Come out, come out Wherever you are Come out, come out Wherever you are One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine… I want to go up. Hey, kid. Don't stand there. Scram! Excuse me. Have you seen my brother? How would I know who your brother is? He's this big and picks his nose all the time. Hello. - I'll have a fishcake skewer. - Just one? Actually, I'll have the handmade fishcake skewer. Okay. Taek! Taek! Stop! Stop! Hey! what's that? Taek. My brother, Taek… Eun-yi, I'm right here. Excuse me. You know me, right? Who are you? What are you doing? Why are you holding our kids' hands? Dad! You took money from me before. 70,000 won. You put on an act asking for money. Are you scammers? What are you talking about? What scam? I've never seen you in my life. Look. I saw you, okay? I don't even know what to say. You don't need to say anything. Just keep walking. You can take this if you're bored. So this is how you want to play? Hello? Police? I'd like to report some con artists. No. Actually thieves. - I'm at Seocheon Service Area. - Run! Run! Where are you going? Please come quick! Seo… Seocheon Service Area! - Stop right there! - Hurry! No, not Songcheon. Seocheon! Not toward Seoul! The other way! Hurry! They're getting away! Stop right there! Hey. Are you all right? Hey, why did you run away like that? Are you hurt? Does it hurt a lot? We did it to feed the kids. We'll never do it again. You're a mom too. We'll never do it again. Please forgive us. Please forgive us. We'll never do it again. Please forgive us. They ran away. So you saw them again today. Not at Yesan Service Area, but here in Seocheon. Yes. We've been receiving a few reports like this. But we'll have to check to see if it's the same guy. Why haven't you caught him yet? There are numerous similar cases, so they're difficult to identify. They're in different jurisdictions, so they get pushed aside. And since they were such small sums, the victims didn't care that much. They need to come to the station or be aggressive like you. Detective, we can check the security videos in their office. Okay. Why don't you come with us? We need to get started on a sketch. Do I have to go? We need to catch him. But what will happen to the kids? Well, I'm not sure. We'll hand them over to the Juvenile Division first. Excuse me. Shall we go? Okay. - Mom! - We're here, Mom! You must've been startled. Are you okay? I'm okay. We found each other, so it's fine. - Were you hurt? - We ran with Dad. It was fun. That's right. We ran like this, waving our arms around. It was tiring. I'm so tired. Hold on. Does your head feel funny again? No, it's okay. - You're okay? - Yes. That fucking bitch. That shit-faced fucker. Hey. Did you see her? Did you? Who the hell is she to mess with our family? It's okay now. - Did you see her holding our kids' hands? - It's okay. Eun-yi and Taek. Taek. Eun-yi. Dad is here, so you're okay. - Eun-yi, take Taek and go. - Don't worry. - Dad, not again! - Fuck! That bitch! Is she coming after us right now? Did you see her? She kept chasing us, didn't she? Fuck. I'm going to get that bitch and fucking kill her. - I'll… - It's okay. I'll skin her and kill her. That bitch! That fucking bitch! Stop! It's okay now. Stop it. Don't cry. - Is there anything there? - No. Look, 100 won! Today is my lucky day Super-duper lucky day Keep looking. Is there anything here? No? Whatever. - Let's get this instead. - No. Hey, don't fight in here. Happy? You're short by 1,000 won. We don't have any more. You'll have to take something out. Put this back. Never mind. Just take it. - I can keep the chips? - Just take it. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Don't fight. - Let's go. Let's eat. Okay. It's okay. I'll eat this one. - It's dirty. - It's not. The hot water killed the germs. Come here. Sit down. Let's eat. We left the tent at the other rest stop. Where will we sleep tonight? We'll sleep in the bathroom and go back for our tent tomorrow. I'll get a stiff back if I sleep in the bathroom. Dad, I want to go to school. I want to learn how to read and write and study. I did all of that… but it wasn't that great. I wish I could try it first and then say that. I'm sorry. I'm sorry that I'm… a loser. Let me see some ID. - My ID? Why? - Let me see it. My ID? Well… I don't have it right now. Fraud, theft, and dine and dash. You'll have to come with us. What are you talking about? Listen. You have the wrong guy. Are you really a cop? A cop is threatening an innocent person! - Stop that. Cooperate with us. - You can explain down at the station. You really have the wrong person. The noodles here are good. You should try some. Eun-yi! - Hey. - Why, you… Eun-yi. What happened? Where did they go? Come out! Who's that? - Over there. - Damn it. Bite them! Stop right there! Roll, Eun-yi. Roll! Hey. Shit. They got us. - Stand up. Get up. - Goodness. What are you doing? Detective Nam, cuff them. The child too? Just the adult. Take us too. What? Why? We're a family. Korean capitalism is at the peak of neoliberalism. And our family tried our best not to harm anyone else. - I… - That's enough. Next question. How many people did you scam into giving you 20,000 won? My family and I have never done anything unethical. Can you write your name and address here? Do you not know how to write? How old are you? I see. Why didn't you send your kids to school, ma'am? We teach them ourselves. What? What was that? We protected them from being left out and bullied in a place where kids are judgmental toward each other. Because we know how degrading it feels. - Ma'am, please come in. - Thank you. He scammed you, correct? I've never seen this woman before. This is so unfair. I'm being framed. What is that called? I want to report this woman for making a false accusation. We have surveillance footage of you asking different people too. Also, Mr. Jang Ki-woo, I see that you're wanted for embezzlement, fraud, and other financial crimes related to the Yangpyeong Redevelopment Fraud Case. That… That's not me. Yes, it is. It says so right here. It wasn't fraud. I was going to pay them back. I had kids to feed. I had no choice. Ms. An Ji-sook is an accomplice, correct? No. My wife knew nothing. I did it all by myself. Just lock me up. I'm sorry. I made a mistake. I swear I'll pay you back. I can make 70,000 won in a day working at a construction site. I'm begging you. Please forgive me. Since you don't have a place of residence, you are a flight risk. Therefore, we'll have to detain you on the charges of embezzlement and fraud. - Detective Lee. - Yes? Lock him up? - We'll stay with him. - You can't. This isn't a campsite. Wait. Hold on. I'm sorry! I made a mistake! Ji-sook! Eun-yi! Taek! Stop! Wait! Hold on! Excuse me. Do you want to come with me? Come in. Can I touch this? No. You shouldn't touch other people's things. No, no. It's okay. It's soft. Get up. You shouldn't do that. No. I'm going to cry. There's a room back there that we use for breaks. You can sleep there. There's also a kitchen where you can cook meat and stuff. Meat? This was left over from the other day. It should be enough. Here. Eat up. I'll eat too, so dig in. - Thank you for the food. - Thank you. Sure. Eat some meat too. Aren't you going to eat? I will. Go ahead. Eat a lot. How far along are you? Pretty far. Let's enjoy our meal. Okay. Have some more. Here. Thank you. So I told them to stay there for the time being. What are you talking about? Get rid of them right now. I can't tell children to leave in the middle of the night. If you want to kick them out, you do it. CHEONGBUK FURNITURE THRIFT STORE Where are you? You need to clap. Over there. Where are you?

Squid, flounder. Breech? The baby is upside down. She's 29 weeks pregnant, but due to a lack of amniotic fluid, it'll be difficult for the fetus to flip over on its own. However, although this isn't a cause for alarm, it bothers me because… the baby may come prematurely. Prematurely? Yes. The cervix is slightly dilated, so we can't ignore the possibility that the baby may come prematurely. Straight from the East Sea. Squid… It'll work. Me too. I'll help too. Hey! - Hey, get away.

I'm sorry. He's such a troublemaker. No, I'm sorry. You should've kept a close eye on him. Why are you so careless? I was careful. But he suddenly came in under the bookcase. What could I do? You probably weren't paying attention. What do you mean? Tseten and I were careful. But we were climbing the stairs carrying that huge bookcase when he snuck in under it like some little squirrel. How could we see that? The doctor said it's nothing. How is it nothing? The child is hurt. Hey, I… You what? You should've been more attentive. Young-sun, come with me. You know me. You know I don't do this. You need to hear me out today. Why did you bring those kids? Tell me. Why did you bring them and make such a damn mess? Get rid of them, Young-sun. Right now. I'm asking you respectfully. Please. Send them away. It's uncomfortable. I don't like it! I don't like them! I don't even know them. How are you exactly the same as you were back then? You never want to get involved if you are slightly uncomfortable. Hey, that's not right. Let's get this straight. Let's get this straight! You brought home random kids to fill that strange void of yours! That's why you're doing this crap! I understand. I do. But this isn't right! Look at this. All because of some random kids. Fine. Let's be honest, Young-sun. Let's be honest with each other! Be honest with yourself too! If you hate this so much, you can move out. Hands. That's it. Good. Would it be okay if I sleep here tonight? Sure. How do you like living here? I finally know what it's like not to have back pain. I'm happy right now. I'm glad. But when is Dad coming? Your dad will be here soon. Exactly when? When is he coming? I miss him. He'll be here after you sleep 100 nights. What's 100? It's ten times ten. You're so smart. I saw it in a book earlier. One, two… Twenty-eight.

Reporter Seo is there now and will tell us the details. The government is insane. The world is crazy. What are they doing with our precious tax money? They think this is some communist country. Shit. If the government pays them, why do you need insurance? They're all lunatics. The world is full of psychos. - Shit. - Excuse me. - Pardon me. - Yes? What do you mean the world is full of psychos? - What do you mean? - What's your problem? We were talking among ourselves. That was a bit harsh. - Calm down, mister. - I wasn't talking about you. Why must you talk like that? - You seem to be drunk. - No, no. Just a minute. - Why must you talk like that? - It was not about you. - Let go. You're drunk. - Why? Tell me why. - Why must you talk like that? - Let go of him. - Stop it. - Of all the… You must've been very hungry. You'll get sick. Slow down. Thank you. How much do I owe you? You had six fishcakes? - I'm not sure. - Just give me 9,000 won. How much do you have? What? How much did you make today? Give me your fucking money. Sorry! Ji-sook… Eun-yi. Taek. Your mom died because you used all that money. - You stupid fuck! - You said to trust you! - I want to go home! - Dad, I want to go home. - Dad, I want to go home! - I want to fucking go home. Give me my money! Who are you? You motherfucker. Don't you recognize me? You piece of shit. You'd do us all a favor if you died. Your mom died because of you. Many people lost everything because of you. And your kids are going to die because of you. You piece of shit. That asshole Jeon Jung-man took off with the money. I fucking lost everything too! LOANS FOR EVERYONE Fuck this… USED FURNITURE AND APPLIANCES That was invigorating. - What does that mean? - It means refreshing. So refreshing. - That was refreshing. You too? - Yes. There are seagulls over there. Those aren't seagulls. They're pigeons. Furni… Furni… - ture. - Ture. Next. I… You. I. You. What's so funny? It sounds funny. "I, you." - I… - When is Mr. Do-hwan coming? He won't be coming for the time being. Will he come after 100 nights too? Here's your change. 2,500 won. - Thank you. Have a nice day. - Okay, bye. Look at me. You're drooling. I want to eat one more. Hello, ma'am. Why aren't you answering your phone? What is it? Your husband was in a fight and is at the police station. But he won't say anything. He could end up in jail. You should go right now. Hurry. - What? What do you mean? - He caused trouble. Come on. Okay. Hold on. He needs to settle with the victim to mitigate the charges. Why did they fight? He was drinking alone and started a fight with another table. He did? That's not like him. Hold on. The owner of the restaurant saw everything and said that they were watching the news about… You know that retreat center fire. They said those parents were living in luxury from the payout. Apparently, he threw a fit when he heard them. He wouldn't tell us the details, so that's all we know. Did you look into it? I said I would check it and bring it to him today. Okay. - You're coming, right? - Yes. - Okay. - See you later. Excuse me. Hello. Do you remember me? We've been looking all over for you. We had no way of contacting you. How's my husband? Didn't he go to you? He's not here? Your husband ran away. We're looking for him and we have an APB out for him. If he contacts you or comes to you, you have to let us know. This is serious. Okay. Eun-yi. You smell weird. Sorry about that. Have you been well? Yes. What about you? Of course, I've been well. But I'm hungry. Why was the cop here earlier? Because of the husband, but I don't know why. Where's Mom? She went with the owner lady to ask about you. I see. Don't tell anyone that you saw me. - Why not? - Just don't. I'm working on something right now. What are you working on? Just something. This is delicious. The owner lady is teaching me how to write. You're good. That looks great. Eun-yi, do you have something to write with? Let me borrow that. That's enough. Let's go home. Ji-sook, can you finish up here and make sure to lock up? Okay. Good night. Good night. - Mom. - Yes? Here. Here. Ji-sook. How have you been? Good. What about the kids? Where are they? Here. Take this. We're going to live here. What are you talking about? Why would you live here? We're going to stay here. Hey. Ji-sook… are you nuts? You're the one who's nuts. What the fuck… What the fuck did you say? Bring the kids. Bring them now. You shouldn't do this. Please. I'll be better. We're supposed to be a unit. We can be happy together. Let's be happy like we used to be. I can't live the way we used to. No. The kids are doing well here. If we sleep here, we don't have back pain. And I can't let the kids become fugitives. No. No. No. You can't live here. Do you think those people can live with us? You know how scary people are. Ji-sook. You need to stop. Let's stop. Please. No. I'm sorry. It'll all be fine if you leave. Everything will be fine if you leave. We'll do our best to live. - Ji-sook. - Don't say my name. I'm begging you. Please leave. Ji-sook. I'm sorry. I've thought a lot about it. I want to help them. I want them to live with us like this. The one I took last time had too many scratches on it. Really? We have a big rectangular one in the back. Do you want to see it? Okay, fine. Don't be so pushy. - Let me take my time and look. - Okay. What are the sizes of these? How many times will you ask? These are 39 inches and 47 inches. - 70,000 won? - Come on. This is 70,000 won, and the other is 100,000 won. - Mom. - It's too expensive. Yes? You can't get a better deal from other shops. What did Dad say? Did Dad come? Is he here? He'll come after 100 nights. Is Dad coming after 100 nights? You made a good call. I'll see you in two days. Okay, sister. See you then. - Goodbye, Pastor. - Goodbye. - Bye. - Goodbye. Ji-sook, let's send Eun-yi to school. School? I can't afford it right now. What? Elementary schools are free now. They provide free lunch and there's no tuition. Still… Sure, there will be little costs here and there. Once you have the baby and recover, you can clean and help out around here. Then I'll pay you a small salary. When can I start school? - Should we go right now? - I want to go too! You want to go too? She's old enough and her birth was registered. Why didn't she go to school? There were some family circumstances. She can start first grade when the school year starts. But what's your relationship with her? I'm her aunt. Are you okay? You can start school soon. Hey, what are you doing? Hey, what are you doing? - Hyun-il! Come here! - Yes? - What is it? - Hurry. - Do something about him. - What? - Hey, mister. What are you doing? - What the hell? Hey. You need to pay first. - Damn it. What the hell? - What? What the… Oh, come on. - Oh, my gosh! - Why that… Get that bastard! Get him! You better stop. Hey! Stop right there! Stop right there, you bastard! Hey! Hey! Stop! Hey! Ji-sook… can we talk for a minute inside? I saw on some home shopping channel that mugwort tea is good for pregnant women. I see. So the thing is… I was hoping you'd tell me how you had been living before you came here. I see. Well… it's okay if you don't want to. Gosh. You can really smell the mugwort. I grew up in an orphanage. I dropped out of school and… I used to work at a restaurant that my husband frequented when he was in college. That's when we had Eun-yi. So… we got married. Take your time. It's fine. My husband dropped out and took on every job he could. When he was selling insurance, he met Jeon Jung-man, a redevelopment association rep. He said we'd get rich if we joined and invested in that association. That the housing value would go up. That our family could live in an apartment. But… What's your name again? I forgot. - Tseten. - What's that? I'm from a country called Tibet. Tseten means eternal life in our language. What does "eternal" mean? We all came from breath and return to breath. Everything changes and follows an endless cycle. That's "eternal." Close your eyes and breathe in through your nose. Breathe out. They're going to love it. - I want one. - Hey. Get back. - It's dangerous. - Meat, please. - Do you want some rice wine? - No, he wants the meat. Chopsticks, please. Which ones are done? Here's a small one for you, Taek. Try it. Give me back my family. Dad! Hey… What are you doing? Please put down the fire. Give me back my family! Hello? I'm calling from Cheongbuk Furniture Thrift Store. Please come quickly. Get off the phone! Get off the fucking phone! Stay back! Stay back. Stop it, Dad! You're scaring me. Stop it, Ki-woo. - Tseten. - Please stop it. Please hurry. Please. You need to come right now. Eun-yi. No. It's okay. Can't we all live together? Please let us live together. Please let Dad live with us. Fire. Fire! Oh, no. Mom! Call 911! - Call 911! Call 911! - Mom! - Call 911! Call 911! - Mom! Call 911! Ji-sook! - Get the fire extinguisher! - No! Oh, no! What do we do? - No! Stay back. - Mom! Dad! - No, no! - Mom! Dad! - Keep looking. - Careful. There may be survivors. - Yes, sir. - Slowly. Concentrate. - Careful. - There are people here! - Rescue Team! - There are people here! Slowly. All together. - One, two, three. - One, two, three. We found someone! Rescue Team! Hurry! - Mom. Dad… - Hey. - Mom. - It's okay. Dad. - Let's race to the corner. - Slow down, kids. - Goodbye! - Bye! Let's go. - Bye! - Bye! - Let's go! - Let's go! - What should we do? - I don't know. Eun-yi! What are you doing? Come on! - Put that end down first. - Watch the legs! Then climb up. That's right. Okay. You're good. Tseten has gotten a lot better. Okay. Give it to me. Okay. That's it. Here comes Brainy. - Let me see. - He's sleeping. He is? Goodness. He's sleeping so well. - How does he sleep so well? - I'm home! - You're home! - Welcome home. Did you have fun? You're home. Hi Daddy, I am doing very well. I go to school and eat well now. I played kickball today at school. Mom and Taek are doing well too. Auntie Young-sun said mom is good at selling things. Taek loves auntie's tteokbokki instead of sweet and sour lollies now. Daddy, I miss you so much. I will talk to you again. Hope you eat well and take care Daddy. RA MI-RAN JUNG IL-WOO KIM SEUL-KI BEK HYUN-JIN SEO YI-SOO PARK DA-ON HIGHWAY FAMILY
