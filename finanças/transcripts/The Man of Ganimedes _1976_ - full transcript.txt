Photo from an oceanographic ship of the Brazilian Navy. Man lives attached to the land and only occasionally lifts his eyes to heaven. Giordano Bruno, in the 16th century, believed in the existence of other inhabited planets. Today, the mystery remains, as strong as then. I have to admit, that morning I was upset. My editor was rushing me to give him a novel I hadn't even begun to write. No ideas. And then... Yes...that's not bad. The house was engulfed in mortuary shadows. The weather was inclement, and the noise, the rain crashing against the windowpanes, gave the atmosphere a sinister character. Have you located the human? The machine is still working on it. Has it found out his nationality? Spanish. Hurry up. We will reach the Earth soon and we must be ready to hunt the humans. I decided to go out for some air to help inspire me. Little did I know what would happen to me later. Alberto Oliver, 52 years old. Widower and writer of detective and horror novels. He lives alone since the death of his wife. Good. That will make things easier. Are the mutants ready? They are dressing in human clothes as we speak. So tell me, how are your novels doing? I'm blocked. I'm exhausted as ever. I have no interest in anything. You work too hard. You fool... If you came to see me more often, I could give you something to write about. For your novels, you know? For real? If I talked to you... I know what you insinuate. Really? Should I talk about it? It would be useless. Plus it would be out of my genre and style. My subjects are western and detective novels. My publisher prefers that because they sell well. Don't torture yourself with this. The inspiration will return soon. The mutants have failed! They are useless! The dense and polluted atmosphere of Earth is hindering their movements. Excuses! This man should already be in our hands! Carol...Carol! - Did you see that? - What do you want? The flying saucer... In the sky... And then some humanoids tried to kidnap me. You're talking pure nonsense. It's true, Carol. You could be in danger. Those humanoids were acting like robots. You're nuts. I don't care about your story. If this is a joke, it's not funny at all. Get out! Ask a psychiatrist to examine you! We must go. Come with me. Sure! Let's ride on a flying saucer! You've been warned! You just made a mistake! A friend... He's a little crazy. I have an emergency! Would you take me to the city? I'm going to the city. Get in. Can you go faster? I must be careful. This road is dangerous. It seems you're familiar with this road. Yes, I dislike it. It's a very curvy road. One curve is worse...the oily one. Excuse me...I don't follow you. There's a curve filled with oil. A truck overturned. Now the surface is as slippery as an ice rink. There have been several accidents. What you're saying makes me uncomfortable. It may surprise you if you're not ready. Is it much farther? It's coming up. I'll let you know. Perhaps you'll allow me to drive on this stretch. Yes, please. You're lucky. I know this road very well. Don't go so fast. The shocks are in poor condition. There's no danger ahead. POLICE STATION Thank you. Pay no attention to the fact that we could have died. When I returned to where I'd left the car I found it at the bottom of a cliff. Three guys were there. I fought them. I gave them a good beating. Then I left and decided to come here. Could you identify any of the attackers? I never saw any of them before. Do you have enemies? Someone who could plan this? No... as far as I know. Mr. Oliver I think we should go to the scene right away. Let's see if we can clear up what happened. I parked the car there. ...and the fight was there. When I left, they were on the ground unconscious. As you may remember, that was my second encounter with them. The first time was at that point... on that promontory. I thought I would escape in the car. But when I came here I discovered that they had thrown it over the cliff. Mr. Oliver... - What is wrong with you? - Nothing, nothing. Do you need something? I could call Daniel. No, please...it's nothing. ...just dizzy. You probably need to see a doctor. These fights usually have consequences. I don't care. You were saying that your car fell off the cliff. That's right. They pushed the car here, then dropped it and stood among those rocks. But the car is no longer down there. I really don't think you'll find it. I don't know what to think. You said that it was in those rocks. Don't try to find it, commissioner. You won't find it. The attackers drove the car away. That's very unusual. How much time has passed since the attack? Approximately an hour. And do you think that's enough time to make a car completely disappear? It's hard to believe. Unless it's been disintegrated. Molecularly destroyed... Don't you believe me? You take me for a fool? Simply, you can't prove what you say. Look at the ground please... You can see the tracks... then suddenly...interrupted. That's not much proof. Please, don't get me wrong. But these tracks might have been made by anyone. What's your profession, Mr. Oliver? I'm a writer. Excuse me a moment. Of course. It seems we're faced with a case of hallucination. Anyway, take some photos. Then you and I go back to the precinct. Well, that's the story. What do you think? We have to investigate the area and ask if anyone saw strangers. I suppose you realize there's no evidence to support your story. Honestly, there's something else I haven't told you. You're suspicious of what I've said. No...don't say a word. I understand your skepticism. There's something I haven't told you yet. Continue...tell me everything. I'm sure I was attacked by aliens, extraterrestrials, or whatever they're called. You see, commissioner, I'd just finished the fight when I spotted a shiny metal ship flying in the area. It was shaped like a saucer with no windows. It emitted a dull hum and hovered in the air like nothing I've seen before. Now you understand why there's no evidence. They destroyed it, including my car. Why would they attack you? I don't know. I'm a writer. I don't know any military secrets. I don't know anything more than any other man. Let's see...let's see... Let's think about this calmly. What have you done in the last few days? I don't see the connection. Answer me, please. I've got a lot of work. I couldn't sleep well, thinking about a new idea for my next novel. ...and you feel exhausted. Is this not so? Yes, indeed. ...and very worried. It's as if all my imagination has gone. It's the first time I've faced something like this. And you can believe me when I say... Ah...I know what you're thinking. You're wrong, I assure you. I didn't imagine this happened. Think about it... It's really quiet here. You can hear a fly. You fell asleep sitting on a rock and that nightmare assaulted you. It was colorful...very real. Don't worry. It's a very common, normal condition. You almost convinced me. But there's irrefutable proof. I left the house by car and walked back. Could it be that you arrived walking? From the city? Come on... You're not serious... A bus could have brought you. In less than an hour, you are here. Why not accept that I might be in danger. You really have to rest. Go home. We'll escort you. Are you refusing my case? I'll report it. We'll do all the routine investigations. You can bet on it. You don't believe what I say. Mr. Oliver, my department is really overworked. If we believed everything we're told about space chases, we'd be the fools. Usually, they're all cases of collective hallucination. No doubt your condition is temporary. But I don't see why I should involve the police. A celestial phenomenon has caught the attention of thousands this afternoon. They've seen a mysterious glowing object appear in the sky... Good evening, Mr. Oliver. Are you shocked? Don't be afraid. Come with us. We're your friends. We want to be friendly to you. We won't harm you. Surrender to us. It's useless to resist. Don't complicate things further. Remember, there is no way out. Who are you? What do you want? You'll know when it's time. Remember you have nothing to fear. Do not resist. Every effort will be futile. Look out the window. A strange machine floating for hours at a height of 500 meters. It looks like a huge plastic balloon on the loose. - Yes? - Commissioner Duran? - Yes? - This is Oliver. I really need to talk with you. Can I see you now? I'm very busy this morning. I'm about to leave. There's something important that I have to say. Can you find me at the zoo? OK, wait for me there. Within an hour. By the north gate. Bye. I want to show you something. See for yourself. Yes, I've already read it. Then, this is significant progress. Little by little... Let's just say I'm interested. Thousands of witnesses have seen it. What have they seen? Well, a flying saucer... ...a spaceship, or a cloud, or perhaps a meteorite. You name it. Your story seems like a novel's. I can't believe it just because... You're hard to convince. Maybe. We have many domestic issues to handle besides yours. The case is too weird, although, I want to believe. Otherwise, I wouldn't be talking now. Now tell me how this relates to the incident with you. I will explain in detail what has happened since we left. I think you should move out. Leave my house? Indeed. I am sure that your house has been tracked by those entities. Do you have another place to live? I'm not sure... I could live a while in my cottage... outside the city. Excellent. I will send officers to guard you 24 hours a day. If there's any problem, we can send reinforcements quickly. You will be properly protected. We should be very cautious. And don't draw attention. There's no need for it. In case something happens to me, I give you this letter, only to be opened after my death. Agreed. - Hi. - Alberto, please come in. - How are you? - I'm fine. Ricardo's at work. - Come in. - I was worried about being late. Don't worry about it. You should call me. I knew you would be at home. How are you? You're lonely since your wife's death. You should live here for a while. Thanks. But remember, three's a crowd. Nonsense. I don't like you living alone. Care for a drink? No, I'm fine. I don't really want anything. Besides, I just had breakfast. I came to say goodbye. Are you leaving? Not exactly. On a trip? I'm going to spend some time off. I've been a little tired. I need to rest. Where are you planning to go? To my country house. Will you want to be alone? At least I hope to find quiet. Just for a few days, anyway. I came to say goodbye, in case you go to my home. Whatever...if you think it's best for your health. Accumulated exhaustion... that's all. We'll visit you. Look, the best thing is that you don't see me. But why? Poor man, you know I love you. I love you too. Go get dressed. You might catch cold. Stop! Stop or I will shoot! I swear I will shoot you! I came to see you. You couldn't have picked a worse time! I told you not to come! You look exhausted. What's wrong? How could you come? What about the cop at the entrance? Policeman? No one was there. The door was open. Don't scare me. I don't have time to explain. You have to believe me and do as I say. Sit down. I've been followed by aliens. They're trying to abduct me. I've been attacked. I think the house is surrounded. They're horrible. Don't be surprised when you see them. They're not like us. Do you understand? We have to leave and look for help. I... Come, I want to show you something. We must hide. If you don't move, they'll leave you alone. They're after me. Promise me you will stay here. No matter what. What are you planning. I'll keep them away from here. Don't try to follow me. Welcome aboard, Mr. Oliver. We hope your trip is enjoyable. No need to fasten the seat belt. It's simply not necessary. You will fly very comfortably. Enough hypocritical lies! What do you want from me? Why have I been abducted? First of all, we assure you, this is not personal. You acted bravely and caused many problems. That's not an answer. You're valuable to us. Very much. Have you heard of anti-matter? Your world is beginning to learn about it. Every particle, every atom, has an opposite with a different sign. We are from a distant planet. ...a mirror image of yours. Identical in everything, but opposite in sign. Like a film negative to a color picture. Mere contact means mutual destruction. So how could you ever come to Earth, being of opposite signs, without being destroyed? We're not the real inhabitants of that world. We're mutants. Biomechanical robots with different tasks to complete a mission. What mission is that? What do I have to do with your games? You're an anti-matter creature. Parallel to an inhabitant of our world. We've spent a long time locating you in the galaxy. Our mission is... trace the anti-matter mirror and take you to our home planet. But how to survive there? I have an opposite charge! The moment I touch your world, I'll disappear. Our leaders have solved that problem. Don't be afraid. I refuse to go there. I don't like your methods. This plan goes against my dignity! I prefer my primitive planet to yours. Come on, Oliver. Be a reasonable man. Do you know what will happen to your world in a short time? Pollution is going to kill all the animals. Energy reserves will be exhausted. No more drinking water. No place to live. The world will be terribly overpopulated and monsters will be born with genetic alterations. Climate changes will come. Then, human beings will disappear as they did millions of years ago, like other zoological species such as dinosaurs, and other large vertebrates. You should believe me when I say the end is near. And, no one thinks it will be a silent end...yet quiet. A sweet death. You lie! I don't buy this. Humans will prevail as they've done before. Only I will not see it. Don't loose hope. You may come back. But you will not want to. Damn mutant! I was happy, blessed by ignorance. Unfortunate human beast. I'm about to read the letter that Mr. Oliver handed me in the event of his disappearance. To my beloved friends, Carmen and Ricardo, to Commissioner Duran, to all government agencies of the world, to anyone who was ever in my place, this letter is written out of fear. Oppressive fear. I know I'm trapped. I'm alone and defenseless. Nobody believes me. They think I'm mad. They think I'm paranoid. The truth is, I'm persecuted by aliens. They want to catch me. I can't tell you why. I'm a common person. But they seem determined. They'll not stop. I'm sure they'll overcome me. When this letter is read, I'll no longer exist for my fellow human beings. Then, it will be too late for me. There are many mysteries man does not understand. Sometimes nightmares become reality. We should support the needy. Certainly, it's much more terrible, the terror that is sensed and unknown, than the other, known from personal experience. I want to thank Mr. Duran for all the help he gave me, despite how much he hesitated. I leave my property to my friends Carmen and Ricardo. For final details, please review the document in my office. Goodbye. Poor Albert. He always had so much imagination. He was never believed by anyone. Calm down. Let's go home. Do you want to go for a ride, Mr. Oliver? I don't feel like it. Hey you! What's happening here? Human...we have returned to Earth. We couldn't go through the anti-matter mirror. It appears that the polarity was reversed and when we thought we had made it... we were really back here. We're back. Soon, the atmospheric pressure will crush us. The atomic battery that allows us to fly will explode into millions of atomic pieces. Run away. You have a small chance. Get away before it self-destructs. But I must warn you human... they will always come back for you. It's me. I'm back. THE MAN PERSECUTED BY A UF0
