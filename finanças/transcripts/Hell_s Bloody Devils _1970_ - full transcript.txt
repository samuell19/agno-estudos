I believe this is what you want. - Count it, curly. What's a groovy chick like you doing in the spy racket? - The count wanted me to tell you that you've been doing a good job. He thanks you. Well, we thank him, don't we, curly? - You tell him to keep sending lots of bread, and that's a whole lotta thanks, baby. - It's all here, cunk. - The count or I will contact you through the usual source. Hey, uh, you know, I don't think she digs us. Ah, who cares, man? We got the bread, with this, we can buy the world! Yeah, screw her. Hey, let's get it on and go spend some of that bread. Yeah, sounds like a good idea. My name is Mark Adams. Almost the late Mark Adams. It started off very simply. I got a call from Joe Brimante in Las Vegas. You see Joe's my boss and a very large man in the syndicate. So, I dropped who I was holding, and I took off like a big bird for money city. Joe had been contacted by the new Nazi party. I thought they had all disappeared into the woodwork. Must've been a very good year for nuts. They were doing their usual numbers about master race, inferior race, you know the garbage. Well, they needed money to keep things swinging. The Nazis had something to sell that was so big that only an outfit like the syndicate could handle it. You see, with their operation, they could distribute the hottest merchandise, and by the time they passed it around, it would be cold as ice. I was Joe's favorite boy, I always got the fun jobs, and this one, I should've stayed at home. - Hi, Mark. - Hello, Maggie. - Long time no see, gonna stay a while? - I hope so. - Hello, Mark. - Hello, Joe. - You know Bruno? - Yeah, sure, how are ya? - Mark. Look at this. - Looks okay to me. - It isn't. - What's the story? - Bruno here made the first contact already. You are to pick up rocky and a lady named Carol Bechtal at the continental hotel tomorrow at 3:30. From there, you'll meet the head man. His name is count Von Delberg. - How did they get their hands on quality merchandise like this, do you have any idea? - Von Delberg is the head of the new Nazi party in Germany. They need money to get rolling. They got some counterfeit plates from world war ii and Mark, I want those plates. - Operation Cicero. - How do you know about that, Adams? - It's in all the books, Bruno. Except playboy, of course. - Mark. This could be the biggest thing we've ever had. Play it with your usual style, huh? Nice and smooth. - Nice and smooth it is, Joe. - Hold it, get brand and Harmon in here right away. Don't call me anymore, we can't take any chances. Use the usual contact. Yeah, that's right. - Our report, sir, up to date. - Flackner had two bullets in him. He was found in the wash in San Gabriel. That doesn't give us much. no, sir. - He was staked out at the Whitfield house. Why wasn't he covered? - Well, it was supposed to be a routine investigation. - Not routine anymore, we've lost a good man. Why did they send you as a replacement? I don't like using female agents. Especially when they're pretty. - Thanks for the left-handed compliment. Oh, no, what I mean is I don't like to send women out on dangerous assignments. - I think she can hold her own, sir. - Try me. -All right, I got a tip. Von Delberg's gonna pass around a few million in quality counterfeit, he's gonna refinance the Nazi party in Germany. - Any good? - Here, you take a look at it. - Looks damn good. I'd buy it. - Gonna pick him up now? - No, no, I want the whole package. The source, the plates, the modus operandi, the whole thing. Here, take a look at this last paragraph. - "It is believed that the plates were made "in Germany during the war. "A colonel Kruger killed off everyone connected "with the Cicero operation and disappeared with the plates." You think this colonel Kruger is in America? - Kruger's still one of the most wanted Nazi war criminals. He could be here. He could be running the whole operation from Germany. Now, we're pretty sure the plates are here, and we also have a feeling the commies are in on this. - That really complicates matters. - Well, our source is gonna tell us where and when the exchange will take place. - I'll keep in touch. - Be careful. - Yes, sir. I figured I'd better keep my eyes on miss Bechtal and everybody else at the Nazi funny farm. It was starting to look like Halloween. Well, I was there to buy that counterfeit money from Von Delberg and try to locate those plates. I figured I'd better try to keep a straight face. - Count Von Delberg, Mark Adams and Rocky Dow. - Count, how are ya? - Mr. Adams, Mr. Dow. You gentlemen care to refresh yourselves? Oh, I don't think so. Why don't we get started? - That's what I like about you Americans. Right to the point. - Mr. Dow, may I fix you a drink? Shall we? - Bourbon? - Fine. Interesting, isn't it? - Very. Tell me, count, can you really produce a large quantity? Naturally. Can you purchase a large quantity? Well, that depends now, doesn't it? On what? It depends on how good the quality is, of course. - This quality in any amount. - We were thinking about an initial shipment of two million. We'll want exclusive distribution rights, of course. - Of course. - Tell me, count. The plates... - Oh, the plates are not for sale. - Well, we're prepared to make a very attractive offer. - The plates are not for sale for any amount. - Sure. When can we expect delivery? - I haven't heard your offer. - Well, the going market price is 20% of value. - For junk, maybe. But for quality like that? 25% - I don't like to bargain, count. 22%, that's it. - You'll be contacted regarding delivery, in the middle of the week. - You know, Mark, I'll bet you those plates are right here. I don't think so, Von Delberg's too smart for that. - Why don't we snatch that kraut? And fry him a little bit and shake him loose for the plates? - Because it wouldn't work, that's why. The guy's a fanatic, he'd never talk. - The organization wants those plates, Mark, and we wanna keep them happy, don't we? The organization will be delirious, rocky. Don't worry about it, huh? - I do worry about it. I'll go have a look around. They invited us to stick around for dinner, and the weekly bond meeting after. They didn't mention the entertainment. - Don't you ever knock? - Excuse me. May I come in? Well, sure. - I wanna apologize about that door, I should've locked it. It's all right. May I sit down? - Are you old enough? Chronologically, or physically? - Well, let's start with the chronological. - I'll be 17 next month. - Ah, you'll be 17 next month? - Mm-hm. - And what do they call you, Lolita? -Amanda, I'm Lucy's daughter. What do they call you? - Oh, Bluebeard, Jack the ripper. - You don't scare me. - You scare me. - Why? - Because you're underage, that's why. - Don't tell me you're afraid to break the law. I thought that's what you did? - Oh? Well, what else have you heard? - Oh, nothing, except that you're a gangster. Oh, how exciting. now, be a nice girl. Now, look, I made a promise to myself a long time ago that I would never take advantage of sweet young things. You're making it very difficult. - Oh, good. - Amanda. - Hm? -Amanda, uh, I am only flesh and bone. I know. - What do they feed you around here, raw meat? What are you afraid of? - I told you, I made this promise to myself and... Well, break it. You are an evil little girl, aren't you? Now we won't be disturbed. - Um, maybe we should wait a little while? - No. Now. But my mother might be looking for me. - We'll hide under the covers. - No, I think I better go. - You seem in very good spirits tonight, Otto. -Ah, lichen, this is a glorious day for us. For our cause. - Things went well with Mr. Adams? - Things went brilliantly. Soon we'll have sufficient money to finance our cause throughout the world. - Oh, Otto, I'm so happy for you. - Soon, you will have everything you've ever wanted. - The only thing I have ever wanted, I already have. You. - This'll never make the late show, man. - Yes, Otto, that's right. When Mark Adams left the party, he took Leni Marvenga to a dress shop. They had some kind of quarrel. Yes, that's what the associates told me. Well, it seems he made a pass at her and got turned down. No, that's all, Mark Adams went straight home after that. All right, I'll be along shortly. Yes, I'll tell them. Goodbye. The count told me to give you this, as a bonus. - Well, thank the count again for us. Tell me somethin', honey. Are you really hung up on that old bastard? - That is none of your business. - Hey, cunk, maybe it was that cat we was followin'. - Yeah, uh, Adams. - Yeah. Pretty boy, huh? You know what you need, honey? You need a real man. - Go ahead, cunk, sock it to her. - Fun and games, huh, broad? - Hello. Hello, Mark? This is Carol. I have to see you. - Where can we meet? - Marineland in the outdoor theater. Okay, I'm leaving now. Come on. There she is. Are you all right? Come on. Who were they? - I don't know, I never saw them before. - Why would anyone try to kill you? I don't know. - Look, are you all right? Would you like to sit down and rest? No, I'd rather walk. When I was a little girl we used to come to the beach often. - Oh, where was that? - Germany. I was born in Germany. You feel like talking now? Maybe I can help. - I have no choice, I must trust you. I'm an agent of the Israeli government. I'm looking for a Nazi war criminal named Bernhardt Kruger. Does that name sound familiar to you? - No. Should it? - We believe he's the same man who has the counterfeit plates you're so interested in. - Well, how does Von delberg fit into all this? - I stay with him because he's our only lead to Kruger. Help me find him. You want the plates. I want Kruger. He murdered my family at Auschwitz. Have you ever hated? Really hated? I hate. I would do anything to get Kruger. ♪ the eyes of the world are staring at me ♪ ♪ but I can see that they're blind ♪ - Do you see anything you like? - Yes, do you have this in eight? Oh. Yes, here it is. The dressing rooms are in the back, if you'd like to try it on. - Thank you. - Hello. - Well, hello. What a surprise. - I wanted to see how you were feeling. - Oh, I'm fine. Just fine, thank you. - Actually, I wanted to apologize for last night. I must've come off like Harry high school, I'm sorry. - No, you were very honest. You told me exactly how you felt. - Could I interest you in a little lunch, maybe? - Well, I... - It's bright daylight out, take a look. I'm very harmless in the daytime, honest. - I'll go get my purse. Gigi, Sally, look what I found! - Okay, honey, turn around a little. Oh, right there. - Mark! - Hello, Amanda. My goodness, that's quite a costume, isn't it? - Do you like it? - Well, it's gonna get you in a lot of trouble. - Oh, I hope so. - It's called mini ha-ha. -All right, I'll bite, why is it called a mini ha-ha? - It's so short, it tickles everybody. - Ah-hah. - Well, I like it. - She wanted to become Maude, and I thought she said mad. - I've been thinking about you, are you flattered? - Yeah, I'm flattered. - I'm sorry about what happened, but next time, it'll be different. Honest. - All set? - All set. Lester, I'm going to lunch now. - Have a swell time, don't hurry back. - How do, how do, ma'am? - Hi. - Isn't that the most wonderful chicken you ever ate? ♪ when did the sun come out ♪ ♪ when did the clouds blow by ♪ ♪ when did we both start feeling ♪ ♪ the two of us could fly ♪ ♪ just as you touched my hand ♪ ♪ just as I touched your face ♪ ♪ that's when the sun came out, my love ♪ ♪ and nothing will erase ♪ ♪ this place ♪ ♪ under the sun ♪ ♪ today and all it brings ♪ ♪ this love that has begun ♪ ♪ to fly on shimmering wings ♪ ♪ if ♪ ♪ we part ♪ ♪ the sun ♪ ♪ will hide ♪ ♪ and the world ♪ ♪ will look at a darkened sky ♪ ♪ but when the sun comes out ♪ ♪ if it comes out at all ♪ ♪ then they will see two shadows ♪ ♪ touching on a lonely world ♪ ♪ this place under the sun ♪ ♪ today and all it brings ♪ ♪ this love that has begun ♪ ♪ to fly on shimmering wings ♪ ♪ If ♪ ♪ we part ♪ ♪ the sun ♪ ♪ will hide ♪ ♪ and the world ♪ ♪ will look at a darkened sky ♪ Restful, isn't it? - Yes. - How do you feel? - Happy. - Yeah.

I wish I could get something on him. He really makes me mad. He's got a terrible reputation with the women. He thinks all the girls are just dying for him. - Yeah, I've heard that about him. - One of these days, I'm going to bring Mr. Adams down to earth. - Uh-huh, well, you're gonna be a little busy for a while. You're the new contact on this case. - Oh, thank you, Mr. Gavin. Oh, that's all right. But seeing as this is your maiden voyage, so to speak, I want you to play it cool, no unnecessary chances. - Yes, sir, I understand. - All right, get lost. - Hello. - Hello, Mr. Adams. Don't make any appointments for the day after tomorrow. The first delivery will be made then. - I'll keep it open. - Good, I will be in touch with you concerning the details. - Time to feed birdie! Oh Alice, please, I don't know what to say to him. I told you once, this is not my responsibility. It wasn't my idea to get the birds in the first place! Yes it was, it wasn't my idea. No, it wasn't! You always do this, this is the same thing you do... I'm not pushing it off on you. Go and stand on your own two feet and just go right in there and tell him what the thing is! - But it's embarrassing! Of course it's embarrassing. Just this once, just this once. Stop fussing with your skirt. I don't wanna do it. Well, all you have to do is... I don't wanna do it. But you gotta, you gotta learn how to... - Can I help you ladies? Um. Yes. In a manner of speaking. We have this problem... - We have this problem with our love birds. - What sort of problem? - Well, you see, we have two love birds and, um... It seems that, well, I thought that love birds were, uh, supposed to, um... - Love? - Yes, yes, that's it. - Uh-huh, and these birds of yours don't? - No. - Yes. I mean, no, they, they don't, no. - Are you sure you've got a pair? - Well, uh... - I don't. - Well, we have two birds. - I mean, a boy bird and a girl bird. Oh. I don't think. I don't know, I don't know. - Look, ladies. Why don't you bring the birds in and let me look at them? - Oh. Oh! - Thank you very much. - Thank you. I'm not the one, you should've done it. - Don't. - Don't? - Yeah. - You're the one! You said yes when you're supposed to say no! That'd be the way to do it! - Sort of the Dr. Kenzie of the bird set, huh? - What can I do for you? - Well, actually, I'm interested in the care and feeding of my toucan. -Toucan, huh? That's a very rare species. - Yeah, I know, I know, and mine is rarer than most. It's an albino. - Excuse me a minute, I'll check on it. Go to that address, and you'll get all the information you need. - Thank you. You keep that up, monkey face, you'll never get paroled. - May I help you? - Yes, my name is Adams. - Oh, yes, Mr. Adams. We've been expecting you. Right this way, please. You're changing here, Mr. Adams. - Thank you. - When you are ready, please go to room four, right? - Right. - Mark Adams is here. I hear you're interested in rare birds. - Yeah, right, albino toucans. Who in the hell are you? - Miss Harmon, I'm to be your contact. - Haven't I seen you some place before? - Very possibly, I get around quite a bit. Not as much as you, of course. - Well, do you make it a habit of flipping your contacts around, miss Harmon? I mean, after all, we are on the same side, you know. - I was told you're a good agent. I'm afraid you were careless. - Well, I am terribly sorry to have disappointed you! - Are you sure you're Mark Adams? - Miss Harmon. How long ago did you graduate from the academy? - Three months. - This is your first assignment? - Yes. - Somebody up there hates me. - What? - Nevermind, look, just tell brand that the pickup is going to be on Friday and that as soon as I get more information, I'll let you know. - Right, the pickup is Friday. - Do you know that I stand a better chance of getting my neck broken around you than any place I can think of at the moment? - I was told to be prepared for any eventuality. - No, I think that that's the boy scouts, miss Harmon. Here, I want you to check out these people. I wanna know everything about them. What they had for breakfast, the works, understand? - I'll take care of it. - Well, goodbye, miss Harmon. And please... Try to relax. - Hello, operator? I wanna make a long-distance call to Las Vegas, Nevada. - Hello. What? Just a minute, please. Maggie, will you, Maggie? Maggie! Will you turn down the television set, please? - Yeah, okay, Joe. - Yes, operator? Yes, I'll accept charges. - I'm worried about Adams. There's somethin' funny going on. - What do you mean? - I don't know. I can't quite put my finger on it, but something's not kosher. - You called me to tell me that? - I'm tellin' you, Joe, the guy ain't with it! - Look, rocky. I have made a great deal of money because of Mark Adams. He's had many opportunities to cross me during the past five years and he hasn't. Now, rocky, I don't want to hear this mentioned again. Do you hear me? - I hear, Joe. I hear. - I think you guys are both a groove. I don't know which one I dig the most. - Yeah, we have sort of a pact, what's mine is his. What's his is mine. Well, if that's the way things are, Who am I to argue? - You're a groove, mama. - Thanks. Do you, uh, do you get loaded? - Sure. - Where are you headin'? - Just looking for a little excitement. - Found it? - I think I have now. - Well, uh. Let's get it on. - Well, my friend, the time is getting close. - We make the pickup tomorrow. - Ah, good, good! - After that, I want everything prepared for a complete evacuation, the plates, everything. The helicopter's standing by. - Hello. - Mark? I only have a minute. I have to get back before Von delberg gets suspicious. I have just received a message that there is no record of any leni marvenga, nor that she came here from east Germany, or that she even existed, just a blank. Well, no one has ever heard of her. - That sounds good, I'll be there in 15 minutes. I'll be out for a couple of hours, rocky. Old girlfriend of mine, you know. - You know, Mark, you're gonna ruin your health, runnin' around the way you do. - Yeah, but what a way to go. - Yeah. Goodnight, Mr. X! Leni! Leni! Hold it! All right, what the hell's goin' on? Oh, Mark. - Forget that, just tell me what's goin' on. I don't know. - You're lying. - No, Mark. - You lied to me the first night I met you. You're lying to me now. I swear, I... - Look, will you stop playing games? Now, I wanna help you, do you understand that? - There are things I cannot tell you. - What things? - Mark, please. - I wanna know, what things? - I can't tell you, I cannot! - All right, get dressed, we're gettin' outta here. Where are we going? - The police will be here any minute, I suggest we go, unless you'd like to answer their questions. Mark, please trust me. - Why? Why should I? - Because I want you to. It's important to me. You're important to me. - Come on, let's get outta here. Stay here, I'll be back for you as soon as it's safe. - Mark. - What? - I love you. - Oh, hi, Mark. - Come on, teeny bopper. - Time to go bye-bye. - What happened to you? - Look, I have had a very difficult night, and all I wanna do is sleep, so... Oh, well maybe I can help you relax, hm? - Come on, Cinderella, prince charming has a flat tire. - Aw, see? I made you relax. - There's no evidence of any real damage. - Well, he looks like he's been through a meat grinder. - When will he be able to go back to work? - He should rest at least a week. - You think you can get him on his feet tomorrow? - Possibly, but I won't assume responsibility. - I'll assume it. - You're not gonna let him make that transfer tomorrow? - We have to, otherwise we blow the whole deal. We got no choice. - Miss Bechtal, I'm Anderson. - Mark told me you would explain things to me. What things? Miss Bechtal, I work for the government, so does Adams. We planted him with the syndicate some years ago to help get information. Now, the transfer of money takes place this afternoon, and that's when we're closing in. We wanted to let you know what our plans were, so that we wouldn't get our signals crossed. - I see. - When you see Mark this afternoon, give him this bug. - What's that for? - He'll put it in the money that he gives Von delberg, and that way we'll be able to trace him. - Maybe to Kruger. - Possibly. Mark also wanted me to give you this explosive device. Now, you can use it as a time bomb by simply twisting it, and you can set it from one to five minutes. Or you can use it like a hand grenade, just pull the clip, and throw it. Any questions? - No. - Good luck, miss Bechtal. - Thank you. What are they doing here? - What do you expect, all work and no play? - I suppose it doesn't make any difference. The count wants you to take a little trip. Go up north, Frisco, somewhere away from here. Things are getting a little out of hand. - Hey, man, you mean that's the end of the bread? I don't think I like that. - I don't believe you. The count said we were gonna have a job for a long time. - Well, here's a little bonus for you. - How much, cunk? - Whatever it is, it's not enough. You know, I think this broad is tryin' to treat us like a bunch of animals. - Yeah. We got feelings, don't we, curly? - Yeah, you bet we have. - Just so we don't have anymore tricks, I think we'll take the rest out in trade. Come on, let's get that dumb broad. - Brand? Bechtal picked up Adams. They're heading south, speed about 60 miles per hour. Stay about half a mile behind 'em in case they got a tail on 'em, do you read me? - Yes, sir, we read you loud and clear, coming in fine. We're holding our distance. - Car one, car two, come in. - This is car one. - Anderson here, we read you. - Car one, you're running parallel with brand. Car two, keep your pace, so far so good. Where is the money? It's in the trunk. - May I see it, please? That's good. Is everything all right? - Adams' car turned left. Proceed at approximately one mile and stop. Probably make contact, stand by for directions. Adams turned off canyon road at point eight-seven. It's a wooded area, they must be nearing their objective. Car one, proceed to point nine, car two, point 27. Brand, close the distance by half, you read me? I read you, sir, loud and clear. - Proceeding to point nine. - Nearing point 27, sir. They are pinpointed at eight-14. Brand, you move in at 307, repeat, 307. Cars one and two. Move in at 307, block the road from the south. Brand's coming in from the north. - Where's rocky? - He couldn't make it. - He had an accident, Mr. Adams came along. - You're a brave man. - Well, I figure I'm safe, as long as you need me. - Got the money? - It's all there. - Show him the merchandise. There it is. Do you mind waiting until I count? - Well, it's all there! Oh, I'm sure it is. - We can see them now, we're ready to move in, sir. -All units, go. - Well, are you satisfied? Well, it all seem... - This is the FBI! You're surrounded! Throw down your weapons and come out with your hands up! Von delberg is getting away. Do you have anything on him? - Yeah, I got it on the screen. He's headed north, looks like he's going back to his place. - Kruger. Cover me. Von delberg... Is Kruger. He... He's getting away. He... - He won't get away, Carol. I promise you. - Calling copter 0201, this is colonel Kruger, come in. Proceed with plan R. Pick me up immediately, must evacuate at the shack. - All right, Kruger. - Drop it, Mark. Are you all right, father? Yes, Mark, I'm sorry. - So that's why they wanted you so much. - They found out I was Kruger's daughter. They wanted to use me to get at my father. - He's with the FBI, leni. You slowed us up a bit, but a cause as just as ours will survive. No one will ever stop us. I got the plates, leni. All right, kill him. Jill! - You had no choice. - Yeah. Come on, let's get outta here. - This is brand, sir. Operation Cicero closed.
