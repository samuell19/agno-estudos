Yes, of course he pays for it, but that is not said said, and even less to the Marquesa.

In confidence, is this girl your secretary or his girlfriend? Well... Yes, right. Ganivell, that is not done. Who is going to believe now that she is his secretary? his secretary? It would go down very badly here. He came because he wanted to meet important people. important people. What do we do now? You have come here to sell your doorman, didn't you... ...then introduce her as your mistress. Ma'am, let's go say hello to the minister. See you later, eh? See you later.

Because I don't trust them,... ...he is very important in the Courts. If you don't have confidence they are of no use to me. You have come here to sell your doorman, haven't you? porter, didn't you, so leave it to me. De Prada, he gives a tone to the affair, and his wife... ...has been the most seductive in the country.

Ah, no, I don't accept it. But what's wrong with him? He's just a son of a bitch. He was in a bank in Barcelona... ...and denied credit to me, to me. Let him be kicked out. Impossible. Then I'm leaving. Wait a minute, think about goalkeepers. No doormen or anything else, how am I going to pay the pay the partridges to that wretch?

Where is Alvaro? Just a moment. Alvaro, congratulations, all fixed, makes the movie. Excited when she learned that she can undress. But where is it, weren't they saying goodbye? She, she, was saying goodbye, but the marquis nothing,... ...a poor man, he says that first his wife has to leave first. Then you have achieved nothing. What do you mean? I have his word and he will will keep it, it is a title. Yes, but his wife is a witch, who will convince her to leave? He's going to pretend to leave. He picks up a suitcase, comes here,... ...insults her husband and then pretends to leave. pretends to leave. The "wanker" lets Vera go free and then let them then let them deal with it. Do you realize that? When I do something for a friend... ...I always go all the way to the bottom but with a lot of discretion. The prince who goes now to the scouting, brings her here to me. ...and I'm alone with her... Go find her. To Vera? No, the one with the eye. Walking? Running. And not a word. And let him come at once and call her the Marquis father, the one with the "taca-taca". And that it is urgent. Jaime, there in the house there will have been no "tomato",... ...I trust Vera, but if the marquis "fucks" her, I'll kill her. But please, if that respectable respectable lady,... ...the mother of the one with the shotgun. Let's have a cup of coffee, we have a lot to talk about. I don't want any fucking coffee! Wait, wait.

Thank you very much. So you call rovellons chanterelles call them chanterelles. Yes, sir,... ...but when Mr. marquis... ...who is taking a nap. Don't worry about it. They are usually older people, almost all of them retired from something,... ...always "snooping around", making the neighbor,... ...and the serenos? Let's tell the truth, for a tip... open the door to Jack the Ripper. Ripper. In short, that the current system of housing protection... ...are inefficient and costly to the the economy. And what do I care about that problem? But it matters to Spain, doesn't it? You're going to lick your fingers. No, I don't like mushrooms... Incomprehensible, I have passion. Well, I'm thinking of Spain, I have the ideal solution... ...to safeguard the property property. The automatic serene doorman. Look, here it is. Microphone and loudspeaker in the portal connected to each floor. The neighbor or visitor arrives, presses the button the button... ...and from above you ask who and from below... ...you reply, "It's me." Don't be a thrashing. The upstairs button is pressed, the door of the portal opens... door opens... ...and the neighbor has access to the home. But Jaime, we all know that "gossip", dammit! You can't tell because no one asks me. They had to take it off my hands. Hey Jaime, are you sure the old lady is with them? with them? Naturally. With the national interest of the device, we could all make a lot of money. I mean to create a new source of wealth of wealth for the country,... ...create jobs, perhaps balance of payments improvement... Since at the moment I am alone in the business,... the business,... ...if the demand required it, you would have to form a to form a corporation. Oysters! I'm glad you don't like them because I'm going to eat them all myself. At least try one. I'm going to find something for you to bite and cheer up man. Hello, good morning. Is it possible that in this house I am the the last one to know everything? I took them myself. But on my farm! And which is very pretty, by the way. Please, one moment. Yes, excuse me. In principle it seems to be an interesting interesting,... ...if within my means I can help you! Very simple, a decree law. Nationwide implementation of the Ganivell Ganivell electronic doorman. No shit Jaime! Extinction of doormen, security guards,... ...just those who are most loyal to us, eliminate them with the stroke of a pen. You industrialists are the the milk. We are or we are not,... ...because what about this? isn't this the same thing? That was the previous team, for such savagery, they were kicked out. You can hear them arguing. But what happens?

Have you noticed the country house? the country house? Every time I cross it, I have to have a drink. have to have a drink. Millions and millions of square meters square meters lost there,... ...without producing anything, but it will fall, it will fall,... ...we already have it surrounded.

Subtitled by TVE Rising flames, and it is a bird to fly. in the night that catches fire in the dark. What a buuusca in the darkness the sweet bonfire of the kiss burns love on her lips... Mexico, the country of light and color, is living in dark times. Violence has has filled a nation with mourning where anyone can be the next victim. The ground they tread is an immense pit; the bowels of Mexico hide thousands of disappeared people. Crime, drug trafficking mafias and parallel power, have become embedded in the heart of of the institutions, adding distrust and uneasiness to a citizenry that is under suspicion. Mexicans want to let go of the inheritance received: a legacy of death and corruption that shakes its foundations. One hundred years after the revolution face another revolt: against kidnappings, threats and extortion. and extortion. They have taken to the streets and demand justice. The antidote against darkness and death. Ayotzinapa, one of the 17 rural Magisterio rural schools of Magisterio in Mexico, is a monument to sadness. The empty chairs wait, in vain,
