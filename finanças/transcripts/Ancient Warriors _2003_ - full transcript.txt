(ominous rhythmic music) (helicopter whirring) Bring in the team. (hawk screeches) They're coming out, with the ambassador. Crunch, get the escort in sight. They're getting close. Hang on. We got to go! Hold! This is it, man. [Aldo] There's no more time. They're at the cars. Hold. Easy, son. [Aldo] Damn it, I need to go! Go, go! [Aldo] Go! (gunfire) (moves to exciting music) (men grunting) Stop them! (moves to somber music) (muffled gunfire) Papa! Papa! Pa, wake up! Papa! Papa! Papa, Papa. Don't die, please! ("Paxi" by Mauro Palmas) (singing in foreign language) ("Su Mare" by Colin O'Malley) (moves to soft orchestral music) Cookies? Aldo, it's been over a year. (birds chirping) (funky techno music) (moans) (cellphone rings) At the tone, please leave your message. Beep. Jaz, you don't have an answering machine. Hey, darlin' how ya doin'? I didn't know it was you. I'm, (exhales) well, right in the middle of a really big workout. What's up? Would you like me to call back? No, no, it's cool. What's goin' on? It's Aldo. I'll be right there. (waves crashing) (gentle music) (heavy breathing) What's the matter, Sparky? You couldn't get a seat in the front row? Look. I know why you're here. You gotta let it go, Aldo. It was my fault. It wasn't your fault. It wasn't anybody's fault. I was in command, remember? Yeah, you were in command, you gave the order, but it was a mission. We all knew the risks, including your father. I didn't even react. I let the car go by. You, let the car go by. You were there all alone, I wasn't with you? You think I don't have nightmares? You think I don't feel like I let you down? I do. Look. Aldo. You gotta move forward. Move on in life, Aldo. You got a beautiful wife, a wonderful daughter. Think of the positive things. The work you're doing for the school. You gonna be all right? I'm fine. See you in the morning. Hey, Sparky. You know, I, uh... Like a brother, I mean. I know. [Jaz] Whoa, whoa, ah. Whoa, ah, ah. I don't care if they did annex the security. The subbasement is the perfect target. Those chemical weapons better be ready. I don't want anymore delays. (dramatic music) (coughing heavily) I'm fine. It's Drey. What? He wants to know our ETA. (phone rings) Drey? Say again. In about 10 minutes. All right. All right, fine. (explosion rumbles) (helicopter whirring distantly) (ominous music) How'd it go? They've added extra security at the sub base. A few new dignitaries must've been added to the guest list. American, I hope. Among others. You get Carlos on it. I don't want anything to screw up. How far away are we? Don't worry, we'll be ready. Don't worry? We're on a timeframe. What's so difficult about building a chemical weapon? Third-world nations do it all the time. (coughing) Jesus Christ, are you all right? I'm fine. Over 2,000 years ago, a tribe of powerful men lived all over the island. These warriors dug caves and mines everywhere. It took them hundreds and hundreds of years to carve these tunnels out of solid rock. It was difficult, and the task was almost impossible, but these warriors, with the help of a great spirit, they could do almost anything. Legend has it, that a special tribal council would gather if any of the elder was sick or near death. For only they knew the secret to unlock the magical potion. The high priest would take the holy chalice and give thanks to the great spirit above. (speaking in foreign language) (ghostly whispers) (dramatic music) Then he would give the elder the mystical medicine. One drink from the sacred cup, and the elder was healed. (speaking foreign language) Then one day, they just disappeared. (rumbling) (men screaming) No one knows what happened. Some say the warriors protect the cup from ever being found. And if you listen carefully, you can hear the whispers in the wind. Papa? Can you see them? You can if you close your eyes. You can sense them all around you. (explosion roars) Ooh, is that them, Papa? (laughing) Maybe, maybe. (school bell ringing) (laughing) You're funny, Papa. What's more important is that we're still digging in section seven. Yeah, but maybe being in the mines isn't so good for you right now. Now? Now is all I've got. I've gotta find that ancient medicine. How many times I gotta tell you my life depends on it? I know, Dad, I'm just saying. Look, just keep digging. We did have another accident. What? Two dead. How the hell do you know that? I'm in tune. In tune, my ass. You're a psychic sideshow circus freak, who belongs in a fuckin' zoo... All right, enough, enough. What happened? They fell down a mineshaft. Nobody can figure it out. Any of our people? No, just some locals. Some of 'em are getting spooked though. They say they're starting to see things. Let's just forget about it. (coughs) Where's Braga? Ancient fucking medicine, my ass. (somber orchestral music) I've spoken with Luigi. The lease was up and an offer was made. They're gonna lose the school. The mining company? What they want with this property anyway? I don't know. Talk to Luigi, Aldo. Maybe there is something you can do. It's no use. Try. Why should he listen to me? He respected your father. As you can see from this last test, we've had a bit of a mixed result, but with the addition of palladium, which should be arriving in the next few days, I should be able to up the potency by a good 30%. But of course, the mice are just the first phase. No, look, look, just make it work. Look, I reexamined the map. I think we're digging in the wrong place. Now, I don't have much time. I gotta find that tomb. Where do you wanna dig now? I want you to hire more men. Work 'em around the clock. (ghostly whispers) What's our actual timeframe? Well, that depends. Listen to me. I got one sick fuck of a delusional father, who thinks he's gonna be healed by some bullshit holy grail, wasting my time in this goddamn hole in the wall. I don't wanna hear that depends. Now, what's our actual timeframe? I'm going to need at least three weeks. Well, you got two. No, no, no, no, no, no. You don't understand, it's not as simple as that. I can't just snap my fingers and poof, whip up some magical killing potion out of thin air. I need time, not to mention the fact that you haven't exactly equipped me with a state-of-the-art facility here. I mean, look at this place. I can't work like this, in this dark, disgusting, subterranean hell. I mean, it's cold, it's damp, I can barely breathe, I feel claustrophobic, and you've handed me these blithering, bloody idiots, who barely speak English and don't do a thing I say. You finished? Two weeks. Now you got a week and a half. [Anna] Dylan, time for dinner. Let's go get you a treat. (Laughs) (swelling orchestral music) Papa, papa. Papa! Papa? Papa? Papa? Zorro threw up. Okay, baby. (moves to ominous music) (ghostly whispers) [Aldo] But you're the mayor, Luigi. Can't you do something? Sorry, Aldo. You know I would'a blocked it if I could have. But after all, they're employing a great number of people from our town, which is helping our economy. And as far as the school goes, their offer has been more than generous. Sorry. Think about the kids. What they want to do with the school anyway? It's not just the school. They're buying the entire block. It's a safety issue. With all of the blasting that's going on, all they want to do is make sure the whole area is safe and secure, that's all. Well, pardon me there, Your Eminence, but I was under the impression that that mine was closed down because they'd gotten everything out of there already. They have new technology, they also have new equipment. There must be something we can do. I'll tell ya what we can do. I have to meet with them this afternoon. Why don't you two come along? Perfect. And don't forget the parade tomorrow. I happen to be the grand marshal. I'm excited. Gentlemen, if you follow me, I think you'll find this interesting. As you can see, we're mining for numerous natural resources. Iron ore, coal, silver. We're going further and deeper than anyone ever has. With picks and shovels? Well, yeah, we have to clear away the debris from the blasting area. Aren't you guys a little bit concerned about cave-ins? We've been doing this for a long time. We know what we're doing. Follow me. (gloomy orchestral music) [Aldo] No! Sparky. A lot of tunnels around here, really easy to get lost, let's go. You know, Drey, I've been thinking. For all of my efforts I believe I've been grossly underpaid. Really? If you wanna continue to have the town's support, we're gonna have to up the ante. Say, an additional 100,000? A hundred thousand. Yeah. All right, we'll take care of it. I thought so. Have a good day, gentlemen. Take care of it. (moves to festive music) (Dylan laughing) (screaming) [Mayor's Wife] Luigi, Luigi! (shouting in foreign language) Luigi, Luigi, Luigi. [Woman] Hey, attento! (exciting dramatic music) (speaking in foreign language) (grunts) (gunfire) (church bell chiming) (dramatic music) Hey, man, what's going on? It was him! I know it was him! I'm telling you, no one run through here. I don't care what he said. It was him! That lying sonofabitch. Where? Where? Where is it? It's gotta be here. I know it, I know it's here. I know it's here. I'm never gonna find it, it's useless. What makes me think I'm any different from all the people who've gone through miles and miles of rock? And you, what the hell did I hire you for? You're supposed to help me find where I'm supposed to dig, and all you do is this useless bullshit, that don't mean shit to me. You're worthless, and I don't have time... There. (exciting music) I'm telling you, this guys wasn't just a local with a gun. He knew what he was doing. Then who was he? I don't know, Italian Special Forces, CIA, I don't know. Well, I think it might be wise to find out. I don't want anything to jeopardize my operation, you know. (ghostly whispers) Oh, and by the way, taking out the mayor in front of the town, now that was a stroke of genius. You said take care of it, I took care of it. He is here. (people coughing) (door slams) Hello. Drop the gun. Found him, sector seven, level five. Hold him at the elevator. Let's go. I'm on it. (ghostly whispers) (grunting) You, idiots, secure the elevator. Wait, you stay with me. Go, go, come on. (grunting shouts) Milius. Milius, do you copy? Milius. (grunting and shouting) Milius, where are you? (screams) (splashes) What just happened? I have no idea. Well, you wanna get one? So, what'd ya think it was? Chemical compartments. Some kind of medical experiment. I need to find out more about this operation. How, I mean, you were already in there once. You had guys chasing you around with AK-47s. I mean, for all we know they could be developing biochemical weapons. I need to do this. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. This isn't about the guy with the tattoo? Hey, you don't even know if it was him. It's him. Let's just pull the team together. No, I need a little more time. His name is Aldo Paccione, Italian Special Forces. He served in Somalia, Kuwait and Albania. His father was killed in Operation Daybreak. Really? The one's name is Jasper Harding, American. Retired from Alpha Forces. He was also at Operation Daybreak. They're dangerous. Yeah, very dangerous. (gentle music) (singing in foreign language) (church bell chiming) (exciting music) The mayor was a good man. How's Dylan? Thank you. Dylan, stop. (screams) (silencer whizzing) (people screaming) (gunfire) (praying in foreign language) Anna. Anna. Guardami. Stai con me. Stay awake, keep your eyes open! Anna, Anna, don't close your eyes! No, no! Anna! No! (dramatic music) You know, they're still gonna come after your daughter. I know. We're gonna get through this. (moves into suspenseful music) Want some soup? Not hungry. (planter shatters) (dog barking) (electronic beeping) (door clicks) Did you hear that? (beeps) Ah, the soup's ready. Uncle Sylvan, did you bring 'em? Oh, I forgot what you wanted. Was it cookies? (laughs) Thank you for letting us stay here, Uncle Sylvan. Anytime, sweetheart. You got anything in there for me? You're fat enough. How's she doing? Same. Doctor says she could be in a coma indefinitely. Something's going down here. These guys mean business. Why don't you go through channels? Local authorities? No, no, no, no. These guys are wired in. Who knows who's on the take? They've gotta be eliminated another way. So, what'd ya gonna do? Round up the boys. (bright techno music) Jaz. Hank, how ya doin', man? You look, you look great. What is it? It's about an operation. No, no way. No, no way. (bell rings) Hank, Hank, Hank, hold on, will ya? [Hank] This way please. [Jaz] Will ya relax? I got all the boys together, the whole band. We need ya, Hank. I'm done with that. I'm out, Jaz. I got a good job. I don't get blown up. I'm happy. You're happy being a bellboy? I'm a bellman. Ah, sorry. Well, hey, bellman, this mission includes Aldo. What's going on? (funky techno music) (grunting) Hey, Crunchy. [Crunch] Hey! Cut, cut, cut. What the hell is goin' on here? Somebody get him out of the pool. I'm working with idiots. Jasper my friend, what's up? - How ya doin', bro? - Good. Hankie, big five. (Cheers) Hey, hey, hey, ya mind? I'm trying to make a video here. (laughs) Take five. Dry him off. Grab anything you want, guys, it's free. You still chewing the coffee beans? [Crunch] Always, man. (crunching) You eat this shit? Little bit. Jesus. You figured out why we're here yet? Must be something serious. Let me guess. You're putting the band back together. We're all invited back to your place for a little rock and roll. Something like that. (crunching) How's Anna doin'? My name is Dexter Heath. Before we begin, how many of you truly love your mouse? Good, because you have to love it and treat it with great respect. If you push it or squeeze it too hard, it will not respond to your touch. Now, let's turn on our computers. One, two... (whistles) Crunch. Figure it out yourselves. Yeah, that's good, man. We gotta talk. ♫ Ooh, I'm rockin' baby ♫ Ooh, and I'm rockin' baby ♫ Whoa, I'm rockin' baby ♫ Oh, but I'm rockin' baby ♫ Uh, but I'm rockin' baby ♫ Oh, but I'm rockin' girl Brock. ♫ Girl, yeah, baby Brock! Hey! Hey. Hey. (funky techno music) Yo, yo, yo, I got next, baby. (cheering) Put me down, please. Hankie, you're as white as ever, baby. Yo, my friend, what's up! (Cheers) Hug that nut. Come on, what's up? [Brock] Come on, baby. Up in, there ya go. Come on, baby, shoot it up, shoot it up. Timeout. Kim. I thought you said you'd brief them. You're right, I did. I just didn't say when. Gentlemen, this is Kim Barnes, new member of our team. [Crunch] Jaz, can I have a word with you? Sure. We need a sniper. What the hell am I? Well, you're stunningly handsome, and a great beach volleyball player... Jaz. Okay, when's the last time you saw action? Just did this war movie. All right, all right. She comes highly recommended. By whom? Sylvan. So who's Buffy? She's part of the team. I think they like you. (moves to dramatic music) Braga! Braga, are we ready or what? Well, I've had difficulty increasing the potency factor with the palladium, so I introduced lead into the mixture. However, the behavior of lead is not 100% predictable. On top of that, we also can't be 100% sure of a constant expiration time, due to the nature of human genetic... Blah, blah, blah. Was there a yes or a no in there? What the fuck is it, a yes or a no? Well, we're close. No, listen to me you little bugger, or whatever the fuck you guys call yourselves over there. Yes or no? Yes, but I need to conduct a test. Fine. Set it up. (hawk screeching) (waves crashing) (gentle music) So, you wanted to see me? It's beautiful, isn't it? How long does a man live, what, 70, 80 years? I want that. Dad, they're digging where you said. Still haven't found anything. I'm very disappointed. [Drey] I know. In you. What? The one thing that could jeopardize the success of this operation, I gave you to take care of and you failed me. What are you talking about? Oh, no, no, no, no, no, wait a fuckin' minute. I blew that sonofabitch off the face of the earth. Apparently not. Oh, Jesus Christ! Don't tell me the fuckin' psychic hotline called. I was there, I fuckin' blew him up, he's dead! All right, all right. Take it easy, take it easy, I apologize. The medication sometimes makes me a little crazy. I got some shit to take care of. Damn it! He's not dead. I know, find him. Find the sonofabitch. (coughing) (moans) Could you open the door a little, sweetie? It's hot in here. Okay. Anna! Where is Aldo Paccione? I don't know. I don't believe you. This is the last time I'm going to ask you. (groans) (laughing) (grunts) Idiot. (metal scraping) It's delicious, what is it? Dog food. (dog whimpers) Here. So what are your plans, Aldo? Finish business. You can't do it alone. What choice do I have? (dramatic music) (hawk screeches) (bright techno music) No! No good, too slow. Do it again. Work it out, Aldo. Real nice, work it out. Oh, there you go, all right. (clapping) All right, big Hank. Let's go, Hankie! Work it out, Hank. Hankie, all right. [Brock] Up and over, come on, buddy! (shouting) [Hank] No, swing too much! (gunfire) Bugger, bugger. You're out. Damn. Get ready for a little explosion. (fire roaring) [Aldo] Was that really necessary? What the? Yeah, boy! (owl hoots) Man, I am too old for this shit. [Dex] Hey, look at that. Hey, Crunch, what's Hankie over there thinking? (laughing) So, how do you do it? What'd ya mean? You know, the telepathic stuff. Coffee beans. For me it's the gun. Maybe you can help me understand this. When I get a target in my sights, I hear voices. What do they say? It's okay. Go ahead. Things like that. You know, once I heard a voice. It took me a while to realize the voices must be from the future. It's like the guy's already dead and he's been waiting for me. It's words already spoken. But it's not them, it's my voice. As if... I don't know. As if... As if you were connected. Is that it? Yeah. You know, I believe a piece of each of us lives in everyone else. Hey, Crunch, what piece of you lives inside of me, huh? He's talking about filling the infinite, and you're still measuring it in inches. Man, what are you talking about? Crunch is your real name? No, no, it's Kenny, but nobody ever calls me that. [Kim] Come on, Kenny. Oh my god. Where are you guys going? I'll tell you more. That is the best damn pickup I have ever seen. Do you realize how old they are? Ancient warriors. (ominous music) We're getting close. What does the seismograph tell you? There is something there, but I don't know what. Good, keep digging, you find it. Good job. It's just a field test. Tiny village, middle of nowhere. How many people? Hundred or so. Is that enough? For our purposes, yes. Prego. Grazie. He must have failed a student. (laughs) You know what's great about this restaurant is they have an excellent calamari. Mm-hmm. My wife loved calamari. She was a beautiful woman, we were soulmates. Lived in New Mexico, you ever been to New Mexico? Yeah, Roswell once. She worked for the government lab down in Los Alamos, became exposed to some damn thing. Sooner or later, it got to her. She died a painful death. Of course, the bastards denied responsibility. They always do, but I know better. So, this isn't about politics. Killing the American ambassador was just a wake-up call. Taking out a U.S. sub base during a presidential visit, now that's really... Justice. (laughs) What about you? [Sonya] What? Were you ever married? Yeah. And? He died. I'm sorry to hear that. Don't be, I killed him. The lab is about there. What about manpower, what do you think they got? I don't know, 50, 60. Sounds like we could use some more intel. Hey, chaps, have a look at this. [Reporter] I'm here with you live in the small town of Ollolai in Central Sardinia, where over 100 people have been found dead. The area has been cordoned off, and a state of emergency has been declared. We'll have more information for you as events develop. I knew people in that town. It won't happen again. (dramatic music) [Drey] Did we double check the time? 4:00 p.m. sharp, the day after tomorrow. I think it's time we get the stuff over here from the island. Ain't that just sweet? I'm glad you could all join me for this little celebration. (laughs) All right. Here's to a job well done. (group cheering) I'm sorry it took such a long time to perfect. Oh, don't be so modest. Come on, you did it right, it works. I don't drink. I don't care. Now, listen up, everybody. We've had a good trial run. Now let's do it for real. [Group] Yeah. Nothing's gonna stop us now. (exciting orchestral music) (man speaking in foreign language) Hey, hey, what the fuck? Come on, shithead, you know what's in that? That ain't olive oil they're moving down there, boys. Uh-oh, check this out. They must be getting ready transport. Hankie, can you rig something up with enough C-4 to blow up the entrance? Can do. Kim, back up Hankie. Dex, set up surveillance here. The rest of you, let's go. (exciting music) [Kim] Hold. What? We've got company, hang on. You're clear. You are a black man, it's night, we're going into a mine. And your point? Looks good, man. Thank you. You about done? [Brock] Yeah. Let's go. (gunfire) (grunts) Fan out, fan out! What the hell is going on? They're trying to take us out. Someone is trying to take us out. I have no fuckin' idea who it is. Well, think, son of a bitch. Who do you think it is? Fuck. (shushing) (man shouts) Someone's coming. (alarm blaring) (gunfire) Hankie, time. I need another minute. This is the part I hate. Explosives set. [Mercenary] It's gonna blow! (fire roaring) You're fucking dead! (alarm blaring) Hankie, where are you? I'm heading toward you. Dex, what's my 20? You need to move ahead until the first intersection, and look out for the bad guys. Where are they? I don't know. They're not on my screen. Great. (gunfire) Shit. My computer! You bastards! You bastards, nobody, nobody messes with my computer! I'll teach you to mess with my technology! (suspenseful music) No, no, no, no, no, no! (fire rumbling) (exciting music) Oh, that can't be good. Let's get out of here. (alarm blaring) Secure the lab, and turn that thing off. Which way? Which way? This way. Dex, talk to me. Aldo, where is everybody? [Aldo] They're on the way to the lab. Find an elevator shaft. Find an elevator shaft, yeah. I can't even find my feet. (suspenseful music) I suggest you drop your guns. Well, well, well, well, well, Aldo Paccione, and Jasper Harding. What the hell are you doin'? I mean, everything was going fine until you decided to crash our little party. We've been looking all over for you. Where have you been hiding? And look at this little group of yours, how cute. Did you really think you were gonna stop us? We're not dead yet, pal. No you are not, yet. A little glitch in the operation of course, kinda like the first time when we didn't get the money, but oh my god, I mean, when that ambassador's car blew up, I mean, that was pure genius. You killed my father. What? What the hell are you talkin' about? That was your father? Oh god, I'm so sorry. I really feel terrible. You're going down. No, you're going down. Get 'em outta here. You are wrong. We'll see. (suspenseful music) (rumbling) (grunting) Oh, shit. (whistling) [Hank] Guys! Nice boomage, Hankie. You wouldn't believe what I ran into. I saw skeletons, rats the size of dogs! Yeah, we're moving, Hank. Okay. Which way? (crunching) This way feels good, let's go. [Mercenary] They escaped. They're heading toward the cliff. Block off the other tunnel, I'm on my way. Uh, fellas? I don't think so. Shit. Whoa, we've got to go back. - Oh, shit. - Oh, shit. We have to jump. Yeah, right, jump, that's a good one. I'm not jumping. We did not cover this in training. Did we cover this in training? Oh, this way feels good. What are you chewin' on, decaf? Whoa, whoa, whoa. What's the worse thing that can happen, boys? We could die. (helicopter thwapping) (gunfire) Or we could jump. Get me down there. (exciting music) Jesus Christ, they're jumping. (gunfire) (screaming excitedly) Whoa, whoa, where you going? Come on, take me there, get me! There is thermal coming off the cliff. Fuck the thermal, come on. Come on, let's go. Do you need a little help? I can do it, I can do it. [Aldo] You jump first! (prolonged yell) (helicopter thwapping) (muttering curses) Fucking geez fuck. No, no, no, no, no, no! Come on, take me back in there, come on! I can't, thermal too strong. Fuck! (moves to gloomy dramatic music) Vaya con Dios. (machine buzzing and whirring) (gloomy music) (speaking in foreign language) (ghostly whispers) (screams) (coughing heavily) (gagging) [Aldo] If the team wants to leave, let them. No questions asked. I'm going back. Aldo, we just lost Hank. You can't do that. He's right, Aldo. If we go back there, we're as good as dead. Is that what you want? Sylvan, call our friends in Rome. Request reinforcements, you know who you can trust. Now you're thinkin'. They can back us up. I have a plan. It was a premonition. A warning. (soft orchestral music) You... You want me to stop digging. [Sonya] Yes. You know that I trust you, you know that I believe in you, but this, this is about life. Life is on the line. My life! I can't stop! And I won't. That's the gist of it. What do you guys think? I don't care, I'm not going back. He's right, man. I mean, what's the point? Hold on, hold on. Jaz, you said we got more people coming, right? I say we wait. Kim? I'm with Kenny on this one. Jaz, talk to him, you know him better... What'd you want me to... The ventilation tunnels go everywhere. They're built by the ancient warriors who used them to fight off the enemy. I never thought I'd have to use them, but I have no choice, it's the only way in. Are you really gonna do this? The lab has to be destroyed. Aldo, what about waiting for backup? It takes them a day to get organized. The element of surprise is on my side. They'll never expect me to go back in. He's right. I'm not asking anything of any of you. (dramatic orchestral music) I must finish this. I don't wanna hear this. Anna, you have to understand. No, Aldo, enough is enough. (helicopter whirring) Where is Dylan? She's on the beach playing with Zorro. Oh, Papa. Dylan. Big boom. (swelling orchestral music) It's small. It's tiny. It's impossible! There's no way a man of my girth is gonna make it down that hole. Whoa, whoa, whoa, hang on there, big man. I'm not exactly a Welterweight, but, give it a little shimmy and a little shammy. [Dex] Are you sure? Oh, yeah. What is it that the more you take away from it, the bigger it gets? A hole. (laughing) [Dex] Jaz, Jaz? Stuck there, buddy? Christ. (Laughs) Are you stuck, Jaz? Yes, I'm stuck, you idiots, get me outta here. Come on, help him out. Pooh bear, maybe you should cut back on the honey. [Jaz] Agh, who's grabbin' my underwear? [Crunch] Come on, get him up. (grunting) We're not going in that way. Of course not, that's a rabbit hole. The ventilation shaft is over here. [Crunch] Big fuckin' rabbit. Shit. Of course not, that is a rabbit hole. The ventilation shaft is over here. (gloomy music) (knocking) What? Sir, the second chopper spotted the wreckage. They're all dead. What? Get out. Get out! (coughing) Come on, let's go, hurry up. We don't have all fuckin' day. Damn it. What the hell is goin' on here? We're evacuating. What? Oh, no, we're not. Who gave you the right... Dad! It's over we're done. Not until I say so. Look, I'm sorry you didn't find your miracle cure, but we need to relocate. Relocate? Jesus Christ, don't you get it? We don't know where the fuck those guys are, or who they told. We're leaving, we can't stay here. We. Are not going anywhere. This is my project. You stupid old man. If you stay, you die. If I go, I die. (dramatic orchestral music) Get out of my way. Whatever he tells you, you don't listen to him, you listen to me now, got it? Keep it movin'. Which way? [Dex] I think it's this way. You think? Would anybody else like to read this map? Right. (coughs) (coughing heavily) Oh, Jesus. Crunch? Crunch? Crunch? Yeah? Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. You and Kim, check out the tunnel. We'll meet you back here. Let's go. I don't care. He's got nothing to do with this operation anymore. I am in charge, you do what I say. He's lost his mind. I know, he won't listen to reason. Did you get our insurance? (frightened breaths) (suspenseful music) I'm gonna ask you this once and I'm not fuckin' around. We're not playing the I'll-ask-you-one-more-time game. It's a two-part question, okay? Where are they? (gasping) And who have they told? No! That's the wrong answer. (Dylan crying out) (cries out mockingly) What fucking language is that? Mommy doesn't wanna talk, but maybe... (screams painfully) Don't you dare. Let's see if we can make Mommy remember. Please. (humming) (crying) All right! All right! Just stop. He's coming here. He's coming here. Oh, it wasn't that bad. And that's the right answer! (explosion rumbles) (suspenseful orchestral music) (gunfire) (yelling) Yeah! Go, go, go, now, now, go! Go! Hey, boys. Where the hell you been, you missed all the fun. Not all the fun. [Drey] Move, move! (exciting music) Follow me. Which way? I'm not sure. Just look at the damn map. I can't. Why not? I lost it. Shit, you stupid ass computer fuckin' Urkel geek! Well, fuck you, you fat fuck! Ooh, I'm gonna, ooh, I'm gonna. No one came this way. (grunting) (crunching) Shit. (moves to suspenseful music) A worthy opponent. But unfortunately, you are out of bullets. (gun clicking) You're right, (crunches) but she's not. She talks too much. [Brock] Hey, slow your ass down, man! Where are you taking me, to the devil's basement? [Dex] Just because you're physically dense, doesn't mean you make mental sense! [Brock] I'm book smart, brother, I went to high school. I got a big gun and I will shoot your ass! (bickering simultaneously) [Mercenary] We're under attack. (gunfire) We can't hold out. Everyone is deserting. Cosimo. Cosimo! God damn it! Where are you going, ya pussies! Pussies! (screams) Whoa, whoa! You guys all right? - Yeah. - Yes. Where is Dex and Brock? They went up top, we lost them. All right, we're heading for Mayhew. Hey, Chief. Anna's here. So's Dylan. Anna. [Drey] Aldo! I'll find you! Get out now. That's an order. I'll cover him, you guys watch his back. All right, you go this way, I'll go up that way. Anna! Aldo! Aldo. Ah, nice of you to drop by. Do you know, if you were dead, this whole thing could've been avoided. Let her go, if you want to stay alive. Tempting. But no! You've destroyed everything I worked for! What, mass murder? It's very profitable. Not anymore. Fuck you! No, no, no, no! Let her go, and you can have me. You? What the fuck am I gonna do with you? We're in love, man. (laughs maniacally) Throw the gun over here. Now, let her go. Shut up! (dramatic music) (grunting) (screams out) [Anna] Baby, thank God. Excuse me. Little help here. Okay, sweetie, come on out. Papa! Let's get the hell outta here. I have one more thing to take care of. Come here, he'll be fine, he'll be fine. Are you all right? Yeah, Kevlar. (suspenseful music) (ghostly whispers) (coughs) (gasping) (laughing) (ghostly whispers) No! No! (gun clicks) It works. It works. You think you can stop me? You'll never stop me. (rumbling) (ghostly whispers) Consider yourself stopped. (moves to peaceful music) We're gonna try this one more time. Get yourself ready. All right, now, what am I thinking? Future. Yes. Two people. Yeah. Us? You're good. Now, what are these two people doing? You're very good. (laughing) [Kim] Come on. Come on. [Crunch] Ow, sweetie, you're on my leg. All right, my man, hot dog. Hook me up, I'm hungry as a hostage. (laughs heartily) That's funny, man, give me some meat. That is meat. No, man, that ain't no meat, that's charcoal. Charcoal, eh? Well, then learn to draw. That's it, that's all I've got. Well, okay, Stanley. Where are the dogs at? I don't know, I lost them. Well, maybe they're with the map. Oh, the map, eh? You're not gonna let that drop, are you? No. Well, do you know something? If it wasn't for me, Stanley here, you'd all be in that mess still! Two days, two days, I haven't eaten! Well, go on a diet then! (bickering simultaneously) Crunch, probably the second-most feared warrior in the history of the U.S. Military. Of course, you're looking at the most feared. Do you speak English? Huh. Sometimes there are no words, are there, dear? Please, continue. Our family. (Brock and Dex bickering) (moaning) Go on a diet! On a diet? Our dysfunctional family.
