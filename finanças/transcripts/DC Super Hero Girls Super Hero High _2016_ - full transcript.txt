I don't think so, Croc. I aced my reptilian monster combat skills final. Almost time. Bumblebee, you're up. Haven't you ever heard of moisturizer? Why don't you pick on someone your own genus? You got her Croco child. Hi, Wonder Woman. I've seen all your battles. I follow you online and refresh your page 50 times a day just to see if you've posted anything new. Too much? Wonder Woman, nice to meet you. Supergirl, time to go! Almost ready, Aunt Martha. Thank you for considering Korugar Academy. Located in space sector... Cheetah, you're on. - Cheetah! - Just a sec. One more level. Ugh! I almost got the high score. Ow! There are always seeds waiting to see the sun. My allergies. The authorities will be here soon, Croc. Nice supering everyone. That's how you do it. Come on. Can't be late for Supergirl. Oh, whoa, ow. Ooh, argh, ooh, oh! Oh, sorry. Oops. Ah, maybe I shouldn't go. I'm sure you'll like Super Hero High as much as your cousin did. Superman was a star super student. Oh, of course he was. Superman had his whole life to get used to his powers before going to high school. I just woke up with my powers when I landed on Earth four weeks ago. What if I fly out that door and run into someone? Or break something? Or my heat vision suddenly... Oh, no! Oh! Don't worry, dear. Super Hero High will help you learn to control your powers. Just remember, study hard. Avoid Kryptonite. And as long as you have that good luck charm, you'll be fine. This? Hmm. Yeah, I guess it did have enough luck to get me all the way here from Krypton. I'm going to Super Hero High. Bye. Take care, dear. Bye! Whoa, oh, ow. I heard Supergirl can leap three buildings in a single bound. Oh, excuse me. Pardon. Coming through. Ooh, Supergirl may be the superest super that ever supered at Super Hero High. Whoo-hoo. Oh, Barbara, for Petey's sake, lift with your legs. Dad, I got it. I'm glad this is your last week here. Can't stand the idea of you working in this cave. I don't mind it. Good gravy, what happened? Super duties. I'm lucky I got a non-super daughter. Would never want my Babsie in as much danger as that phone. Dad, I have work. Hands off the cash, Nonnie. Nonnie? I'm Barbara. Nonnie. A non-super, AKA, you. Your phone can't be fixed but I'll give you a loaner. B-A-T. Access granted. Ew, I can't even. What is it? It's one of my BAT, I mean... Barbara Assembled Tech gadgets. I made a few mods. Emergency homing, enemy targeting taser... Ugh! My phone had apps. Whoa! Sup, Supergirl. Looking fly. Hey, Supergirl. Hi, Supergirl! Ni hao, Supergirl. Welcome to Super Hero High. She waved at me. Uh-huh. That's how I do, cock-a-dood-doo. Cock-a-doo-doo. Uh-huh. That's how I do, cock-a-doo-doo. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! My unmentionables. Awkward. Are you hurt? No I'm fine. Sorry. Really sorry. Students, initiate damage control protocol. Wonder Woman, you're on amathus inspection. You got it, Principal Waller. Bumblebee, check for additional microscopic infrastructure damage. - Sure thing. - And to repair the electrical... - I'm on it. - Thank you, Barbara. Vice Principal Grodd, take over here. Students, get to work! Hi, Super Dupes. I'll show you to the dorms. I can tell you're a gal after my own heart. You know how to start off with a real bang! Any damage from Supergirl's impact? - I don't think so. - Double check. Any crack could be disastrous. This amathus contains more energy than a nuclear power plant. Enough energy to amplify a villain's arsenal 100-fold. You got it, Principal Waller. And keep an eye out for Supergirl. We need her safe. After all, she's a one-of-a-kind catch for Super Hero High. Of course, Principal Waller. I'll show you one-of-a-kind. Whoops. Hush, you. Yo, want some help with that, bro? I am not your bro. Can I ask you something? You have been for six hours, Harley. I didn't know I could opt out. Is it true that your only weakness is that green glowy stuff? Kryptonite? Yeah it drains my powers. Now if that's it, I need to figure out how to get online. Ah, why didn't you say so. Let me call IT for you. Barbara Gordon! Oh, that gal's got some galloping gams for a non-super. Later, girlies. My Internet, I'm trying to chat with my aunt but I can't connect. Let's see here. - Thank you for considering Korugar Academy. - Oops, that's just nothing. Korugar Academy? That's an awfully long way from Super Hero High. That was the point. But here I am. And if my classes tomorrow are as disastrous as my arrival today, you should be ready to duck and run. Don't worry. I always have my safety goggles handy. What's your schedule? Weaponomix, Intro to Super Suits, Combatistics. Your hardest class is PE, and that's an easy A as long as you know the three pows. Great. Now, if I only knew what the three pows were. Super powers, brain power and will power. You really are new. Fresh off the spaceship four weeks ago. Pow, Internet on. Oh wait. Know of any websites that can teach me how to be super? Websites? No. But I know someone who can help. Come on. Oh, there she is. Granny. Oh, oh, oh, sweetums. Oh, well, I was back here changing the burned-out bulbs and I didn't hear you girls come in. Hearing's not what it used to be. Supergirl, this is Granny Goodness. Head librarian at Super Hero High. Nice to meet you Mrs. Goodness. Everyone calls me Granny. Oh, my dear, what a grip you have. Well, I shouldn't be surprised since I saw what you did to the cafeteria. In all my days, oh, I have never seen anyone break through super proof steel before. Supergirl needs to get up to speed on super heroing. What should she read? And, oh you'll need Liberty Bells, Unabridged History of Heroes. Oh, oh, whoa. Now, have a cookie. Thanks, Granny. Oh, I can't... Thanks, Granny. My ride's this way. You can find your way to the dorm? Definitely. - See ya. - Good night. It's this way or was it that way? This has to be it. - Supergirl? - Sorry. I was looking for the dorm. But you found the Boom Tubes. Boom-booms? Boom Tubes. Teleportation devices. I'm sorry. I didn't know. Of course you didn't. You missed the freshmen welcome tour. Here. Boom Tubes access granted. Welcome, Principal Waller. Wow. The Boom Tubes can go anywhere. Scartaris, Atlantis, Korugar, Florida. Florida? Lots of strange super villain activity there. Bingo! At Super Hero High you're learning how to be a super hero. Not just for Metropolis or Earth, but the entire universe counts on you heroes. But why lock up this amazing stuff? Apokolips. Years ago, Darkseid, the ruler of Apokolips, hijacked our tubes and brought his army to Earth. Our heroes nearly lost the battle against Darkseid. Whoa. Now, for everyone's safety I'm the only one who can access the Boom Tubes. We heard the alarm. Did we finally catch our bad guy? If it isn't my favorite junior detective society. No bad guy. But I did find a Supergirl. Make sure she gets to the dorm. Good night, students. - There you go. - Thanks. I got it. Let's go. Post haste. I'm sorry to mess up your investigation thingy. Yeah, we're hot on the trail of a big case. Security breaches, encrypted messages being sent off Earth, suspicious attempts to break into the Boom Tubes. Boom Tubes access denied. Hurry, Flash. Catch the perp red-handed. You got it, Hawkgirl. Hey. Hey. Flash, where's our perp? - Gone. - Could this be important? I found it by the Boom Tubes. Nice. We'll have Ivy trace it. Name the three pows of superhood. Super powers, brain power and will power. Oh yeah, that's using your brain bucket. Oh. Sorry. You need to watch yourself. Yes, sir. Vice Principal Grodd, sir. Oh, sounded like he woke up on the wrong side of the hammock. Just betwixt you and me and the lockers, rumor has it our primate pal used to be a super villain. Mmm. But our wallabies got him out of the big house on some work release program and... Oh! Ah, Harley, what's that terrible noise? I know how you feel. The class bell gives me the heebee-jeebies too. Welcome to PE. It's strength test day. My lovely assistant. Oh man, you're making me blush. Huh? Good job, Wonder Woman. Top of the class as always. Supergirl, you're up. Let's see some of that super strength. Um, Beast Boy. Would you mind? You got it, Mama. Wow, that is really... That's great. Whoa. Oh, whoa. Whoa. Sorry, Coach Wildcat. I... I didn't... Your antics put everyone in danger. Learn to control your powers. Or the next time someone will get hurt. Lady Shiva, you killed that weaponomics exam. I was like, "Whatevs, Nonnie." I mean can you believe they let someone like her... Suspect's initial attempts to break into the Boom Tubes occurred three weeks ago. Supergirl dropped him. It wasn't really her fault. She couldn't know how wobbly Beast Boy gets when he goes so big. Supergirl! I saved you a seat! Um, I have to study. What is it, Ivy? I did the test as you requested and, as I suspected, it's Guadalongapholia. Bamboo. Bamboo? I don't want to mention the 800-pound gorilla in the room... Hey, I've been looking for you. Argh, watch out. Oh, yuck. Everybody thinks bats are creepy, but bats are the bomb. They make the best of what they have. They don't have night vision but they got to hunt at night. So they use the talents they have and pow, echo location on. If you say so. Batgirl. I wish I could be like you. You mean an awesome, fearless, fun tech engineer whose also undeniably humble. That, but, you know, a non-super. Then I wouldn't have to worry about hurting anyone. And Earth would be safer. Earth is gonna be safer because you are a super hero. You just need some practice. It's my last week working at Super Hero High so I have some time to help. - You in? - Yeah. Yeah. Whoo-hoo. Go. Obstacle one, tap each pole. Sorry. No more apologizing. You're here to learn, which means making mistakes. Don't be sorry for learning. Obstacle two, laser. So, oops, sorry, I mean, good learning experience. Obstacle three. Tunnel of doom. Oh, that was not super. The first step to being super is believe in your super self. Believe in my super self. Major wedgie. That's why supers wear Spandex. Good as new. And while I was at it, I took the liberty of making a few mods here and there. Thanks, Barbara. While I'm here, I wanted to talk to you about Supergirl. She could use a stronger sparring partner but she's way too intimidated to ask you herself. You're like her idol. Wait. You mean she's not trying to compete with me? No way. She's trying to be like you. I believe in my super self. Go! Come on. You can do it. - Yes! - Excellent save! Brilliant! - Whoo. - Yes, yes, yes. Nice. Did you apprehend the suspect? Not yet, Hawkgirl. But you were right to be concerned. Whoever tried to break into the Boom Tubes came close this time. Whose got two thumbs and knew something funky's been up? Flash, put those thumbs to good use and dust for prints. Whoever did this was way strong. And the scratches, that's so... Animialistic? Gorilla-esque? Primatey? What I'm trying to say is Vice Principal Grodd is up to no good. We don't have enough hard evidence to make accusations. Yet. The super-villain compendium. I've marked some interesting sections. Thanks. "Gorilla Grodd commands gorilla army "in attempt to conquer Central City." Hey, cheer up, Babs. Not working here means that you can start a new safe career. We'll have spaghetti tonight to celebrate. Sure, Dad. And that's why we suspect Vice-Principal Grodd has been trying to get into the Boom Tubes and bring his gorilla army to Metropolis. Even though I'm not working here we'll still hang out on weekends. Here, I made you something. It's a friendship bracelet. Thank you. - You're welcome. You're welcome. - See? Two-way comm link. - See? Two-way comm link. We can still talk anytime. Awesome. But wait, I've got something for you, too. Really? Katana made it. This is amazing. Thank you. After all I've done you're accusing me of this? I can't take any chances. While I'm reviewing the case I have to revoke your security clearance. Take it all. I quit! Yeah. Huh? Save the day alarm. Come on. Should I? You're ready, kiddo. Giganta's robbing Eclypso Jewels. Beast Boy, you lead the crew to get the citizens out of danger. Oh, yeah! It's gonna save the citizens like a boss. Cheetah, Bumblebee, Harley, Supergirl, you guys are with me. Giganta, put the jewels down. You again? All right. I'll put 'em down, and pick up this instead. Wow. Those were some major mods, Barbara. Come one, come all. Welcome to elephant express, yo. Just 'cause this is a rescue mission doesn't mean we can't have ourselves a pachyderm party. Yay, Beast Boy! Hurray! Ha-ha, that's got 'em. And while Bumblebee's distracting her we'll... Whoa! Hurry, girls. I got this one. Just like you had Beast Boy in PE? Ow! Ugh! Oh, no. Ouch, that stung. I'm sorry. So sorry. This is awful. Supergirl, maybe you should leave the superheroing to the pros and everyone would be safer. But I was just trying to... Trying and failing. I thought you was toast. Bumblebee, you okay? Everybody calm down. I need to think. No. See? Even Wonder Woman would be safer without you. Uh-oh. Bumblebee got a boo boo. Harley, get Bumblebee out of here. You girls with me. You'll be safer without me. Oh! Oh, finished already? Finished with Super Hero High. I'm going to Korugar. I'll be in the next space ship off Earth. Why wait? Just take the Boom Tubes. But the Boom Tubes are off-limits. Oh, not for you. With your strength you can open the door. What was that? Oh, just my Perry. Some grannies have poodles or parakeets, I have a pet parademon. Who's a good parademon? Now, I won't tell anyone about you breaking into the Boom Tubes if you don't tell anyone about me breaking the "No Pet" rules. You're sure it's okay? Oh, of course. Now, you get in, jump that tube to Korugar and I'll lock it back up before anyone notices. Nothing bad can happen. See? That's how you do it. None of that scratching and banging. Now take care of that screeching. You wait right here, sweetums. Finally. Furies, ready. For today, we conquer Earth. Yeah! What? Who are they? Oh, my Female Furies. Big Barda, kryptonite this one. Huh? Argh! Leave her. She'll be an excellent addition to our army. So gullible and eager to please. Furies, with me. Perry, fetch my dry cleaning. Perry, be a dear and hurry up with that armor. My attack begins now! Oh! There's something so flattering about apocalyption fashion. Really brings out my eyes. And now for the perfect accessory, this adorable Mother Box through which we'll channel the power of the amethyst to control the supers. Come along, darling. Supers in giant trouble in downtown Metropolis. Oh, no. Supergirl? Supergirl? Come in, Supergirl. - I... - Are you okay? Barbara? Oh, I really messed up. N-32. Come on. Let's get you somewhere safe. Ow! Giganta, you're going to the big house. The really big house. Hah! I knew those giant novelty handcuffs would come in handy. Awesome heroing, supers. Now, let's head back to school. Then I got her right in the kisser. Anyone seen Supergirl? Right there, Perry. Force of Apokolips, power of amethyst... Oh, my, pecan pie! That's a lot of power. Makes my toes tingle. What is the meaning of this? You're sitting in my chair. Yes, Granny Goodness. By the way, thank you for falling for my whole framing-Gorilla-Grodd ploy. I needed him out of here since we never cracked the code on gorilla mind control. You're welcome, Granny. Good afternoon, Super Hero High. Congratulations, students. You're currently coming under the control of good old Granny brainwashing. Granny Goodness? Hail, Granny. As my super army you'll pave the way for Darkseid to conquer Earth. It wasn't Grodd. It was... Granny, I love you. No one can stop me now. We have to stop her. I'm on it. I calculated the frequency of Granny's device and created a de-trancer. I just need a crystal to conduct the energy. Would my good luck charm work? Yeah, but, don't you need it? I don't need luck. I believe in my super self. Pow! De-trancing on. Now, to release a super from the trance just point this at them and push the button. Frequency shield and totes adorb earrings, they'll keep you from Granny's trance. Nope, you're coming with me. Fighting super-villains? That's for supers. And you're not? Barbara, you helped me learn how to be super. And look at all the stuff you made. I know you're super in here and in here. Now, the first step in being super is believing in your super self. Wow, Barbara! Who's Barbara? I'm Batgirl. Frog in my throat. I'm Batgirl. Come on, Batgirl. It's time to get our super hero on. Big Barda, Artemiz and Stompa, keep post outside. Speed Queen, Mad Harriet, stand guard in here. Apokolips to Barda. Are those paint splatters more interesting than me? No, it's just the supers who go to school here, in their studies, they get to make beautiful things? Yes. It's a waste of time that has made them weak. Now, go! How do we get past them to get in? De-trancing the supers one by one won't work. They'll catch us before we have enough supers to fight. If Granny can use the amethyst to amplify her powers, I can use it too. I'll plug the de-trancer into the amethyst. Great. I'll create a distraction. But... Hey, Big Barda. Miss me? Can't catch me. Oh! Hmm? Another super? I'll stomp her down. I got her. Argh! Vice-Principal Grodd. - Granny? - Furies, attack! Guys, Granny Goodness has gone bad. Defend the school. Ahhh! Ugh! Hiya! Argh! Hiya! Supergirl? Supergirl? Yeah! Here kitty, kitty, kitty. Let me give you a nice scratch. Argh. Huh? Hey, let me out. I said, let me out! No stomping on my grass. Huh? Nice flying. Help. Granny? Speed Queen? Artemiz? Girls, you're safe. Wait. Are you wearing a super suit, Barbara? It's Batgirl now. And we've got a no good granny to stop. Come on. Huh? Granny, give up. No. The amethyst will be mine. Sick 'em, Perry. Down, boy. Ha! Useless parademon. Stop! Your little lasso can't stop me. Take one more step and you'll say goodbye to Super Hero High. It's a cookie jar and a granny grenade. Did you really think I liked baking that much? I hate baking. - Ooh! - Supergirl, Granny can't break through super-proof steel. You non-super fool. You think you can defeat me? Come on, try! No. Huh? No! Yeah! It's going to blow. I got it. Supergirl! - All right. - Yes. Belle Reve penitentiary and juvenile detention center. I hate detention. At least it's not Florida. Let me help you take out the trash. And take all your junk with you. You saved me. Thank you. All right. Enough mushy stuff. Sorry we misjudged you. Yes. The whole lot of you are in detention for the rest of the year. Heh, it was a joke. Lighten up. Ow. That's a good one, Mr. Grodd. Your text saved me. Thanks, non... I mean, thanks Barbara. It's Batgirl now. And you're welcome. Whoo-hoo! You were all that and two bags of chips. - Wow. - Yes. Great Gladiolus! Hey, Dad. Is the spaghetti ready? A special thanks to Supergirl for her vital role in our victory. Bravo, dear. That's our girl. Whoo-hoo! Yeah! And finally, on Wonder Woman's recommendation and the faculty's approval, we have accepted a new super to Super Hero High. Batgirl! Batgirl! I'm very proud and very nervous. Pow, Super heroes on.
