GANGSTERS AND PHILANTHROPISTS Too bad... It's Monday. A meatless day. Where can you find a judge who is a vegetarian... How low the defendant has degraded himself... in his deep cynicism and perfidy is proved by the fact that he took advantage of the authority of my learned colleague, a retired judge and a man of great merit, to suit his ill purposes. Yes, your Worship is right! He used to play chess with me! Knight a6 to b4 and your castle is taken, professor. Knight a6 to b4. You're right, I have lost my castle. Well, you've put me in a spot... Let me think it over. The Tartar has been caught but he is not yet beaten. Understood? Yes, it's a smasher! I'm asking whether you understood. Keep your opinion for posterity. You will have plenty of time to write diaries in the future. I've understood. Extraordinary. Give me the card index. Well, judge, d3 to d4 and check. Four men are needed, a van and a big... high-powered car. Jemmies, screwsmen, fences... burglars, motorized. Jumper is out. He gets the jitters. Scuttle-mouth cracks. - Pedro? - Retired, gave up the profession. Why then is he still in the card index? I'm not Interpol to collect inventory left-overs. I see that your work has fallen off. Let this be a warning to you . - Kajtek? - Is resting. Pity, how much longer? Two years to do. He may get out earlier, but... The Screw? Rings a bell... He's good. Drives a taxi. We'll take him . He is well qualified. Who else do you suggest? Baldy, but he has gone into the poultry business. He has a van but those ducks and chickens of his... - I don't care about them. - He may refuse. Me? Baldy... Parmesan, what are you writing down? I've already announced phase B. And if so... Well, what does it mean? Phase B... Phase B... Well, Parmesan? What does it mean? Phase B of an anticipated action calls for utmost safety measures: A - taking down notes is strictly forbidden, B - changing brand of cigarettes, C - removing trademarks from clothing, D - changing shoes. That's enough... The rules must be strictly followed. Sailor and Cock-Eye, in prison. Crane, in prison. It's getting more and more difficult to find good pros. Lefty? He got nabbed. - How long? - 5 years, an old lag. Why haven't you taken note of it? You were promoted... I'm warning, you'll be put back on a manual job. - Professor? - Speaking. I'm running away with the King to d5. And what can you do about it? King e5 to d5 Bishop c2 to c4 and mate. Good night. Tomorrow, white pieces. - A narrow escape! - You put me in a tight corner! - You castled. - Right, it was my greatest mistake. - Good night. - Good night. The Siamese Brothers. They are skirt-crazy... But who hasn't got a weakness? The best for a sharp and quick job. We'll try them . Take those Siamese. Their resemblance may lead to an interesting situation. What kind of situation, Parmesan? Think, if you can. Well... What situation? The number of people taking part in the action, well... - They could muddle witnesses... - Splendid ! See, you know it all if you get to thinking. So, Screw with a taxi. What kind of taxi, maybe FSO Warszawa? Of course not! Special import, but what a car! The Screw, Baldy with a van and Siamese Brothers. This a serious job. Warn them not to take up odd jobs for now. Roll-call tomorrow at 10.00 p.m . sharp. - Hi Baldy. - Hi. - I have an invitation to a dance. - Dance yourself. Not from me, from the Professor. Roll-call at 10.00 p.m. These hussies will sign your death warrant one day. 10.00 p.m., sharp, at the Professor's. - Where to? - To the cooler, Screw. Parmesan ! Damn you ! Listen, old man... - Professor... - Wait. I'll pull away... just in case. OK, get going . D3 on d4 and check, my dear Judge. The daily turn-over at the Central Department Store... is about 8 to 10 million. Does this figure seem satisfactory to you? So, let's get down to brass tacks. Department Store's van. Police Jeep. At 0.05 hours. Money sacks have been put in the van. The escorting police Jeep drives away followed by the convoy van. The distance between those two vehicles is about 30 to 40 metres which enables the policemen to have an eye on the van. At 0. 12 the Jeep pulls over to the bank. The van drives in and sacks are unloaded. The whole operation lasts 7 minutes. A bit short. Somebody said something? I thought... I heard something... The American, or rather the Italian-American system to be exact would call for a daring attack during the loading or unloading of sacks. And of course fire-works, machine-gunning and siren-blowing would add to the show. In short, a big circus a cowboy-show. Bodies fall by the dozens. There is something vulgar and cheap in it. Something which is akin to the old Roman circuses, isn't there? It's true that in every human being a beast sleeps... But my ways are different. Let's get down to our problem. I'm drawing your attention to a weak point of the convoy's route. The time is 0. 10 hours. At that moment the police Jeep takes a turn and loses the sight of the van for some ten odd seconds. Now, watch this carefully. Here is the Screw's car. There's Baldy's van, a twin-sister of the van transporting money. Both vehicles are waiting... with the drivers' feet ready to engage the clutches. When the sign is given, the Screw bars the way of the store's van. Baldy's van takes a quick turn and follows the police Jeep to the bank. He passes the bank and dashes off to the "Shine & Polish" workshop where his car will be repainted at once. We'll gain two full minutes by the manoeuvre with the van. Within those 2 minutes, we have to load the money and clear off. "Covering" of the escort and driver will be done by the Siamese Brothers taking up waiting positions in the doorway of the house no. 21 until the Screw's car enters into the action. Parmesan and I will be standing in this area. Watch the whole action on the scale-model, please. Parmesan will make the van inoperative. A punctured tyre and cut horn's cable will do the trick. Then helps me in unloading the sacks. The Siamese disarm the convoy. The whole action at the intersection lasts 50 seconds. The pursuit will not be in full swing for ten minutes. During that time we'll reach our destination. Any questions? How far is from our jumping-off place to our dump. 8 kilometres and 352 metres Be warned, that you cannot exceed the speed limit. No monkeying with the traffic cops. On no route in Warsaw I could push my car up to 60 for 8 kilometres. It's a run go... and we'll get licked, I say. A very sensible remark. A modern through-town route will solve all the communication problems of our capital. The fathers of the town are taking care... It's very good they do. A modern road surface will prevent wheels from sliding. Fluorescent and well-spaced lights, a wide roadway will make this route... Stormy threw Ziuta on to the couch like a cigarette-butt... Parmesan, what's that? An instalment-story. I collect it, got mixed up somehow. We'll talk about it later. Will you come here, gentlemen. Screw, aren't you delighted ... with the press notices and praise of the excellence of the new route? But when will it be ready? Engineers are in a hurry. We don't have much time for preparations. I'm running away with King and what can you do about it? Bishop c2 to c5 and checkmate. C2 to c5... Checkmate indeed... Tomorrow you play black, Judge But you were in a tight corner. You castled. Yes, my situation was hopeless. I did castle and it was my great mistake. Good night. I'm announcing phase B. Ladies and gentlemen ! We are at the construction site of the new route. It's a most impressive sight. Dozens of machines operate along this splendid and most modern route. And now let us listen to our brave builders. How's it going, foreman? It goes, why not? You've heard yourself: it goes! This simple work becomes a symbol! A through-town route! Our beloved citizens are flowing in to visit the construction. What can you tell our listeners about the new route? We all care to see the work done as soon as possible. Bravo! I'm sure that our builders are of the same mind. We notice the terrific speed with which the work proceed. Your little hands. Have you found anything? OK... Don't be so keen on rubbing me down. Listen, Baldy... . I don't reckon to lose my job because of you. The boss has already got sore at me. What's the idea of sewing pockets up? When you lost a lottery coupon last time we didn't see you for three years. Only two correct numbers anyway. Cracking guy! Get to sewing in silence. We may get into a shemozzle. When I got picked up last time and thrown into the can I was stewing there for six long years. We're going to beg for dough with a chopper. That's not a pick-pocket job. If we don't pull that trick I'm gonna be stored away. Every dick sings a song about me. I won't explain it to you. I can only assure you, my dear Parmesan, that to speak slang is very bad manners. - Documents and other items checked? - Yes. Just like children. Distribute gloves and documents. Arms will be given on site. The time is now 19.58. Everybody checks the time against my watch. At 0.05 get to your positions. And now go and arrange for alibis following my instructions. Good evening, Judge. I think that the first move is mine tonight. - Yes, it is. - Are you ready, sir? Of course. E2... to e4. The King's gambit. Be careful, damn you ! Hey, you ! My God ! I'll have to pay. Don't worry, Granny. God bless you, boss. What's up? Do something to get us out of this. May it's the fuses? - I don't know. - Try the hand-lift. I'm not allowed to operate it. - Than what can you do? - Open the gate. I'll call service in the morning. Now stop making fuss or you'll wake the tenants. Get some sleep somehow. Sergeant, I've sweated off my brow today! I'll have a nap in a car. Keep an eye so no drunkards meddle with it, will you? - All right. - Thank you. Go on. - Everything OK? - I sleep under the best of care. And my feet are soaked through. But I have a perfect alibi. The policemen are approaching the bank. And now a moment of consternation. A dreadful suspicion creeps into the minds of our dear friends. The alarm will be given in 8 minutes and we'll reach our destination by then. A Horse... The horse is ready and the armour... The horse is ready and the armour... Oh, girl, are you mine... Time to go to bed, Judge. It's past midnight. Embrace me... and give me my sword... I'll give checkmate to the Professor right away... The bed is made... Good night. The Tartar has been caught but he is not yet beaten. Horse... a6 to b4. Taking your Castle and your Queen is attacked. A6 to b4? Right, my Castle is taken. Well you've put me in a spot. I have to think it over for a minute. Judge? D3 to d4, checkmate. Have they gone crazy? It has just been raining. They have to follow scheduled plan. Overtake it. You, half-baked sap! Where are you standing? A policeman told me to stand here as I have no lights. They told me to stay here till the morning... Stop! What's up? What's going on here? Your license. Your license, please. Officer, I nearly ruined my car. He's standing here in the middle... Yeah... The wind-screen isn't clean. - The water-cart... - The wiper. One, two... Three... Four... Four passengers, according to regulations. And what's this? Sacks? Against the regulations. Sacks may be transported either in boots... or in goods-taxis. A fine. Thirty zloty. We're very pressed for time, officer. Any delay may cost us a lot of money. Here you are. Here you are. - Night tariff on? - Yes, officer. Go ahead. We've lost a lot of time. And, damn you, switch to the night tariff. How long am I supposed to teach you that minor details matter a great deal. We're on the new route. Four minutes and thirty seconds left. Show us now what your vehicle is able to do. Digging away again, damn them ! What does it mean? Where are we? Warsaw, Professor, on the new route. Driving round will cost us four minutes. Go to the left side! Slow down. Speed up! Boss, they are at our heels. We have to shake them off. Hide the guns, you fools! We're only breaking regulations. Alarm in two minutes. Turn to the right. To the left. To the right. Left. They'll catch up with us on a straight road. I've foreseen this possibility. Take the money. Stop! Hey, look! The boss' car. The Professor is a genius. It's two jumps from here. One minute, it's enough. Forty seconds. Thirty. Twenty seconds. Five. Two. Checkmate. Quiet, please! Does the defendant, plead guilty? What can he say in his defence? And milk has boiled over again. Everything falls on me. One can go crazy. Maid, charwoman, cook, jack-of-all-trades. That's what I am for you. I've wasted my life. I've grown old over the pans, my liver is upset, a good-for-nothing husband and a wooden-headed daughter. A very modern one, a rock-and-roll champion who doesn't know how to watch over the milk. Even water burns in her care... I'm talking to you . I know. My heel has broken. I need thirty zloty. Thirty zloty, why not a hundred? Nylons the day before yesterday, a petticoat tomorrow, you're a demanding one, my dear. When I was your age I used to wear fustian knickers and I had only one black dress. The other one was my Sunday best. I had a long pig-tail. Not e bee-hive on my head every second week. I was a sweet, modest and industrious thing. And that's probably the reason... for being given a loose daughter and a weakling for a husband. I cannot understand even now what I saw in him? Could have had many other men... Ambitious, clever, good-looking... Jankowski, a police sergeant. You know what it was before the war? Florczak, a master of the butchers' guild. Zybert, a house owner. They were real men. Flowers are blooming over Jankowski's body. Florczak is in jail. Only greenery remains from Zybert's house. There's nothing to be sorry for. What do you want from poor daddy? He is as he is, good that we have a daddy at all. You could try to develop your mind instead. Your daughter teaches me what to do. I'm too stupid for her. She's ashamed of her own mother. Thanks to our hard work to pay for her education. A splendid new generation is just growing up. What do you want from her. She's good at school. Daddy has again salted his coffee. I'm quite pleased with her. You're pleased with anything. Your life is so good and so plentiful. So you think. No desires, no ambitions. Some people have quite a good life. Malinowski bought a washing-machine and a TV set. One can't even dream of a rise. It's a miracle that they keep you at work at all. He bungles everything he does. Here's your lunch. You don't want any more breakfast. Eat it! I don't raise pigs! I can't. You've again done your best to spoil the beginning of a day for us all. Such mattering ought to be prohibited by law. It causes social damage. And, moreover, it doesn't make sense. Did you hear that? Did you hear how your daughter snapped back at her own mother? But you just don't care. Would anything reach your mind? You never listen to me. You don't care for anything I may tell you. Will you give me your alcohol-gauge, please. Yes, here you are. Substance B contains... 48 % of alcohol. Reagent C contains... . 48 % of alcohol. The chloroform-gauge, please. Please write this down... . The chloroform contains... 33 % of alcohol. Thank you for the alcohol-gauge. You're welcome. And what can I tell her now? How can I... look her in the face? I can't tell the truth at home. It's one o'clock. I can't return home before four. I'll go... and look for a job... It's dirty on this side as well. We have a limit. I won't bring you a clean one from home. You can go to the "Bristol". Can't you put some napkins? One loses one's appetite... Napkins have finished. Are you ordering something or not? Leave him alone. What do you want? Something to drink, maybe... Half a pint and a herring. No sausages, no kidneys. No beans a la Bretonne. No meat-balls, than what is there? Roast-beef, steak a la Viennese... pork-steak and beefsteak. You can read, sir, can't you? We'd like something good but tiny. It's still early. There should be bar dishes. If you want to have pub-prices, a milk-bar is the place for you. You're not very obliging. So are you ordering something or aren't you? Call the manager. I'm so sorry. I have an outdated menu by mistake. I asked in the kitchen and recommend the kidneys. Fresh and delicious. A clean table-cloth. Please forget a little misunderstanding. What can I do for you? - My bill, please. - Certainly. One drink. No charge for the herring. Not eaten not counted. Ten zloty and twenty. I'm here if you need anything. Sir, sir! You've forgotten your newspaper. Excuse me, are you getting off? Tickets, please. Sir, how long can we wait? How can I help you? An appetizer or some special order? No, nothing more My bill, please. Won't you look at the menu, sir? We recommend very good chops or a steak. Or some fish? No. Thank you. If you change your mind... I've been tempted... A juicy steak, please. May I have a menu? Two packets of "Carmen". Again. Everything falls upon my head ! Maid, charwoman, cook, jack-of-all-trades. That's what I am for you all! You're still in bed ! You know your father's been working very hard. Try to help him if only by watching over the milk! It's hard for him to get up early, his liver is upset. It's getting more difficult to stand your morning concerts. My present work is very responsible. There must be quiet from now on. Quiet! And kefir! Kefir! Give me kefir! It seems that daddy simply has a hangover. He never used to drink. I simply can't understand... It started with this new job. He earns quite a lot but I smell vodka every day. Works late at night. I'm worried he may fall ill or become an alcoholic. He may even get sacked. And what will we do then... Drop this medicine into his cup every day. Tea or coffee. But don't let him notice. After some time he won't be able to look at alcohol. Time to get up. I've made you a delicious coffee. It'll set you up. Fine... Boss... Two. Not without a snack. So two pickles. That's another story. Hey! Your coffee has been excellent lately. I've never had a coffee like that before. I'm glad you like it. And how are you today? I'm fine. Fine... No. I won't go to work, not tonight. The co-operative have already started digging foundations. Splendid ! You'll have your own house. We have to pay the next instalment. Then you won't have your own house. What happened? Tell me. They sacked you for drinking. I knew. Just what I was sure of. You've shown them what you are worth. You got a good job and then you started drinking. You've never listened to me. What about us? My words never carried any weight with you ! What did you say? Nothing in particular... Don't get upset, please. Say it again ! Say it... That my words never carried any weight... Weight? Weight. Weight... Any vodka? No, no alcohol. It's about time for you to go. I could get leave for tonight. You must discipline yourself. You have a good job and you must keep it. Our house is going to cost us a lot. It seems that we'll have to pay some more. The miscalculated something. It seems that your mother is going to tend to us all night. We need to figure out something. Let's take to our heels and start doing Poland. Enemy approaching ! Enemy approaching ! Our speciality to the drain. Bar-snacks on the stove! Penny-snacks on the buffet! The customer is always right! He is there. Over there. Our chemist. Who has passed such a siphon? He doesn't know how to use it. Or the gas has gone, it's been stored for three months. That's long beyond the time limit. He seems to be annoyed. Daddy's here. Let's scram. Mushrooms! Mushrooms everywhere. I told you, more vitamins! But there is cabbage with the pork-chop. Well... He goes away. He didn't take it! The Chandelier? The Elite speaking... Listen, the chemist was here. In a very sour temper. The bait didn't catch at all. Pass it on. Metropoly? The chemist's furious. He won't bite. The Pacific? The chemist is running amok. He won't bite. We must hot up the bait. Atlantida speaking. He's here, come immediately. Let me introduce myself. I'm Malaga, this is our maitre d'hotel. - Kowalski. - Pieczarkiewicz. - Kowalski. - Superata. Kowalski... Do you mind our joining you? Well, do, please. My dear sir, it can't go on like this for a long time. Not day after day. I don't myself like home-made soft water but to probe into it every day... Please. A drink every day, one can go crazy. I can understand bar-snacks... But the profit limit... I've got a husband and two children. Couldn't we... substitute quantity for quality? You visit us rarely... and we'll give you more. You'll ruin your health this way. But this way... one good turn deserves another. Take it away. And you're alone again. And nothing cheer you up. You're bored with idle talk and disgusted with wine which has not helped you any. The women's shrieking laughter plays on your nerves. Then somebody's hand moved and the whole world has changed. You seem to be in a trance. Nothing has happened, nothing that matters. There are no reasons to feel like that and yet you are pleased with the whole world round you... Is it love? Who knows? You're laughing and the world seems to be bright. You wish you could do somersaults and the wine is delicious again and you're delighted with all that people say every little silly thing. You've met somebody... You've got somebody... Somebody who has got into your blood. You don't know what's up with you. Sometimes you want to laugh and then you're suddenly blue, for she is not with you. You're in love, you've got somebody. Somebody who has got into your blood. But you'll pay dearly for your folly. Who cares? Let the whole world fall to pieces for one tiny gesture. A movement which has changed Your whole tiny world, it's all like a dream . Nothing's happened, nothing which could have mattered. There are no reasons why you're so happy... That's love... And you're laughing and the world is bright again and you'd like to do somersaults. Life is bubbling again. You've got somebody. You've everything. Just like Paris! Dear sir, we have a great pleasure to present you a cake which... She's divine! Simply divine! Yes. The cake! They're for me? I've got your card. I simply wanted to thank you. Just a trifle. I wouldn't call it a trifle. Was I... I was a little bit rude, wasn't I? Rude? It was a sweet inducement... I have got a good brandy and coffee. Please, drop it... just for a moment. I'm not sure whether I can... intrude upon you, this late. You're a gentleman. And we live in the twentieth century anyway. The world is bright again you'd like... And the wine is delicious again... Every little thing seems delightful... You've met somebody... You've got somebody... Somebody who has got into your blood... You don't know what has happened to you ... You want to laugh... Good morning. Daddy's returning from work? I've been with Daddy. Our manager invited me. And we met Hanka on a street. Good night, Daddy. Don't be angry, Mum . Oh, God ! Look at yourself! You're killing yourself. That work is much too hard for you. You aren't so young any more. I've always seemed old to you. You've never notice that I'm a man. But... You've met somebody... You've got somebody... Many a woman would... What? Tell me, you've been drinking? You've got into the habit again... And our house almost has a roof. I'll soon become a widow... I don't want that house! Let the dream of my whole life fall to pieces. Better give this work up then start drinking. But they need me there. And moreover... My work has a wider, social aspect. Other people are involved, do you understand? The whole industry will fall apart. You'll have your house anyway. Yes. A sweet home made out of thirteen bricks, a little home like a heart... My sweet pie-face... You'll get a house as big as a town from me. You'll get... If it had been a civilized country a little car accident could have happened... A nice swim in a dangerous spot... A coronary thrombosis... or... No, no, I'm on my beam-ends. Watching this chemist outplaying me! I seemed to be such a smart alec and he has outsmarted me. I have no more strength left to fight against him. It's a very poor bargain for me. Gentlemen ! I got it! Can't we just do it the normal way? The normal way? Just as it ought to be. And how's that? That is... The customer is always right. I can't do it that way. But that's the only way out. We have to alter our attitude. But I've got a husband and children. Oh, life... Be careful, the plate is hot. Enjoy your meal. Take it, please. Yes, sir? And mushrooms? On request, do you want them? No, thank you. The bill. Have you any complaints to make, you ate almost nothing? Must I? You had, sir, a steak... And water. The water is included. May I have something to drink? Soda water, mineral water, Kryniczanka, orangeade Fructo? A beer? Zywiec, Okocim Porter. I'm sorry, but we've not yet got export beer. Cold Okocim. On ice? The buffet? Three cups of tea. One English, one Viennese and one straight from the samovar. If you're in a hurry I can recommend the ready-made dishes. Goulash, beans a la Bretonne, meat-balls, fish a la Nelson or Polish veal-chops. As a specialty we recommend braising beef. All guests find it delicious. Beef twice then. This table is unoccupied. No, thank you. A RENAISSANCE OF POLISH CUISINE? GREAT IMPROVEMENT OF GASTRONOMICAL INDUSTRY. WARSAW CITIZENS DON'T WANT TO EAT AT HOME. THE FRENCH REQUEST POLISH WAITERS AND COOKS. Sit down, please. I'll announce the verdict's validation. As the defendant, as it has been proved by investigation and witnesses, never used any false documents of a civil servant and he has never tried to impose himself as such, there are no grounds to find him guilty. Witnesses had no reason to believe Mr Kowalski to be anybody other than the private citizen that he really is. The fact that money was given to him cannot be considered as a tentative bribe but as a presentation. An aspect of mass philanthropy manifested by certain groups of our society will undoubtedly be extremely interesting for sociologists. But that is not a matter in which this court is interested or is called to investigate. I didn't expect they'd kick us in for so long. A meatless day. It's all the cod's fault. I am so deeply moved ! All those flowers and congratulations after release. Here are diplomas from various bodies. From the Gourmands Union. Oh, how beautiful ! To the partisan for the health of his countrymen. Beautiful ! Wait, that's not all. Look! A statuette from those doomed for mass-feeding establishments. Isn't it lovely? Wait! A little gift from the Polish Dietetics' Union. Oh, how charming ! What a pit y it got damaged. Look, a section of the Dietetics' Union, A section of liverish people. Simply beautiful, isn't it? And there was an article about Daddy in a magazine. And what is that? It is... That... Summons from the Internal Revenue Office. The Internal Revenue Office... asks me to file income-tax returns on income Again everything is falling upon my head. My life has been wasted, I've grown old bending over the pans, I have varicose veins and a good-for-nothing husband. What I saw in him? I could have had men, real men... Ambitious, good-looking, clever... Jankowski, a police officer, Florczak...
