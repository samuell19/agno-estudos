THE CHRISTMAS TREE Pascal, if you don't like that, change it - order something else. No thanks, Dad. Mr S?gur, your call from San Francisco. I apologize. There he goes again. I'll only be a minute! Do you know what time it is in San Francisco? Five or six hours different - but I can never remember if it is earlier or later. Nine hours earlier. It's exactly eleven minutes past four in San Francisco. It must be very important to call somebody at that hour, I can tell you. Oh, you don't have to tell me. Why don't you ask him for a hamburger, or something else? Dad ordered for himself, so he ordered for me, too. From now on, we mustn't let him do that. From now on! Now, let's talk about your vacation. How much time do you have? The usual. Then perhaps you'll remind me how much time you usually have for your summer vacation. Six weeks and four days. Tea with lemon for Mademoiselle Graziani, Coffee for me . . . And you? Everything. Everything. So where would you like to go? As long as it's not De Ville or Monte Carlo or Capri. I am only curious, but what's wrong with those places? Dad likes gin rummy and backgammon - I don't! Well, where do you plan to take us? Can I choose? Do you promise? Then we go to Corsica! Corsica? They say that there is nothing there but caravans and camping. That's exactly what I want, to spend summer in a tent. Dad, you promised. He was right. I am a witness. Pascal, I'll go to great length to make you happy, but I will not spend summer in a tent. What time is it? Nearly four. I've had two swims already. You could have wakened me. You seem such a tired old thing. You're right about being tired. This is the best sleep I've had in a week. Now we'll see about the 'old thing'. I'll race you into the dinghy. I won, I won. *I* won! I said I'd race you *into* the dinghy. Dad, still cheating! I agree. But let that be a lesson to you. Never trust anyone, and especially not your father! I won't. Here we go. Where are we heading? Where would you like to go? To the west! To find camphor, cinnamon and pearls. And to catch a fish we can cook. All right. Throw the anchor over so that we don't drift too much. What is it, Dad? I think they lost an engine. Don't worry, they'll get in on the rest of them. Dad! The fishing line's stuck. On what? The anchor, I think. All right, I'll go in after it. Dad, Dad, look! Look there! You'll have to let go of your line. Look! There! You think it's a flying saucer? Who knows . . . but I think that's unlikely. Dad, look out there, and there! A parachute! A parachute! I don't understand . . . it's not a man. What is it? It's gonna land in the dinghy! No, it's a long way off. That plane just exploded. Do you think it's a military plane? I don't know, kid, but we've got to get out of here. Untie that anchor, and let the line go. What a funny thing to happen. Bad luck. People need good luck, don't they. Of course. I'm cold. Here, put this on. The pilots didn't have a parachute, so this thing must be more important than the pilots are. I'm sorry we're leaving. Me too. Corsica is cool, isn't it? It's great! And the tent wasn't too bad? It's better than where I had to sleep during the war. Verdun told me about it. He said that when the Germans were looking for you, you had to sleep in a tree. Well, it happened once. We had just blown up a train, and managed to escape to the mountains. Tell me about it! Oh, I think the Resistance and the War is something to forget. One orange juice, and a Fernet Branca. I love the sound of the waves. It's soothing. No, definitely not fish. Not after the rumors we've heard. All right . . . . . . maybe chicken cooked on the spit? No, just a steak. Rare? Medium? --Rare. And for me too. Medium. And a salad. You shouldn't talk about the fish. You know you got the guy very mad at the restaurant in the harbour. Where we almost went crazy. It is better to take some precautions. If something has happened like in Palomares, I have a right to know about it. Order a salad for me. I have to make a phone call. Dad, you promised no phone. It's not business. Catherine, maybe? It certainly is not your concern. Waiter! Waiter! Menu, please. One Salade Ni?oise, spaghetti Bolognese and Mouton Chop. The prefecture of police, they don't know. Because they don't want to know. I've heard rumors. You must have heard them. No, don't give me that . . . Please Raymond, I've heard enough. You're in the office in Paris, you must know the details. If this is serious then I have to know, because I was not alone. Pascal was with me, and I am concerned. Understand me? It is better that you come back to Paris. So, it's an atomic bomb, like those in Palomares in Spain? We recommend that you return. Why? So you can hush it up? Laurent think about it. There's no point in alarming people. Of course we mustn't upset the interests of local tourism! What is the joke? Nothing. Dad was making fun of me, that's all. So far, so good. I'm going back in an hour for more X-rays, but nothing dangerous. A whole hour? Where shall we go? Let me think . . . Too early to go to a movie. We could go to a library, and improve our minds. Pascal would like that! --Bah! One hour? . . . I have an idea! Fasten your seat belts. Here we go! How much more time? Twenty minutes. We can start back slowly. This means that we can visit the wolves again? We've already been there twice. How about a soda, or a drink or something. The wolves! What about Catherine? Why don't you ask what she wants? She wants to see the wolves. Hurray! Would she like to see Chateau Herod this weekend? No, not this weekend. Another one, perhaps. Pascal! He meant that as a warning to you! But I knew, and he knew, he wouldn't bite me. Isn't he fast! --He learned to be. When did he learn? --A few thousand years ago. Pascal, here's your coat. It's time to go. I'm sorry to leave them. We can come back tomorrow, before you leave for scout camp. Wolf cubs camp. So we'll bring them something to eat. What do they eat? I don't know. I'll buy you a book about it and we'll find out. You know, this is the best vacation of my life! And you too, Dad? Say it! Truly the best. And you know something else? We haven't even finished yet! Goodbye, wolves. Chateau Herod. The place I love most. I am happy you brought me here. Is this where you were born? A few miles away. But, even when I was young, before we moved to America, I told myself that one day, this place would be mine. I'm glad you never changed your mind. I thought there was nobody here. There isn't. Marinette sleeps in her own cottage. I told her not to wait. And you leave the door open? In a place like this, yes. Pascal's camp is near here? Not far. And you will go to see him? Now? Come on . . . How many rooms in the Chateau? I have no idea. You mean you never counted? I really do not know. I only know that we live in about six or seven, the rest are closed. Ah, men. Such helpless creatures. Sure you won't have one? No. Why such a question? Is this a new way of interviewing people for "Paris Match"? Not that I'm complaining. I've told you, I am a senior art director, not a journalist. Mr S?gur, my readers would like to know, how do you explain your success? First, my dual citizenship, and the fact that I earned my first million before I was twenty-five. And your success with women? My dual citizenship, and the fact that I earned my first million before I was twenty-five. I guess you will not tell me. You are a lost cause. I thought, once you've met Pascal, and you've seen this place, you think, this man can't be completely bad. And of course, it's a good thing that Pascal and I like each other. And I don't wear high heels in the camp, right? Do not get me wrong. I'm not worried about that. Your elephant bracelet - does that bring you luck? Yes, and special luck. It's the hair of a white elephant. Do you think you could take another one on? A ten-year-old boy, this house, and me . . . . . . a white elephant if there ever was one. I promise you that we will be happy. You, me and Pascal. But do you know why I want to marry you? Of course. Because you want two passports. Where do you want to go? East? or West? There! Mmm, the smell of fresh air! Too late to escape. Oh, you're dying to see Pascal. And I am, too. Come on, let's go! At first I thought it was a flying saucer, but my father said he did't think so. Was it a flying saucer? Not at all. The thing that went so fast was the engine, all on fire. But the parachute was something else. Golly! And what happened then? Then we returned to the shore, and made some coffee on the wood fire. It doesn't taste too good that way, sort of burnt taste. And then . . . Dad, Dad! Pascal, get in line with the rest of them. All in place. Let's go! Children, wash your hands now. Lunch is ready in the kitchen. Just a minute. I've nearly got through to Saint-Tropez. Ah, that good-for-nothing Verdun? Give him my love. Hello, Verdun? How are you? Hi, Pascal? Finally. Tell your father I'll be back in a few days. I'm helping my friend Robert, who has a problem with staff. Hello? Hello! No, Mademoiselle, this is not Marseille! Oh, no. Hello! No, of course I don't mind being interrupted . . . That's Verdun, the one I mentioned, at a luxury hotel in St Tropez. Yes. I'll tell her. One moment . . . That's enough from you, little gangster. You'll be sorry! And stop that shaking! He's talking with a very important client. Hi, Pascal. I miss you, too, Pascal. What? Call me back later. I said call me . . . I said send me a telegram! Then write a letter . . . No, Mademoiselle, this is not Monte Carlo! Who wants bread? Me, me! Aahhhh. She's nice, your mother. That's not my mother. My mother died. How did she die? She drowned in the sea. Not bad, right? Let me hear it! Excuse my asking, when did Pascal get that bruise on his forehead. He had lots of small bruises. They never last for more than a day at a time. I have to make a telephone call. Pack your bags, and one for Pascal. We're going to Paris right away. There is no cure . . . There is no hope . . . Drink it. All of it. My God! No hope at all . . . If I told you differently, it would be a lie. Like the lies you told us last month on the first examination! At the time I told you that you both would have to repeat the examination. The boy was clean. None of the tests showed any radiation. How can I be sure you're not wrong again? You are not God, and you can make mistakes! This time you did a biopsy? Last month it would have shown nothing. Three other specialists were with me today, the three best . . . Like Bridge, it takes four. Four to condemn a child to death! Four to decide . . . He's not in pain. Will he be? It is highly unlikely. The nurse will tell you what medicine he has to take, and how to give him the injections. More than that we can not do. This treatment that you're giving him now, can't you continue with that? The drugs that level off the irregularity of the blood, they're dangerous and cause cellular toxicity. When repeated, they wouldn't have the same effect. How much time is left to him? From three to six months, leading a normal life, maybe a year if he stays in hospital. You think six months is better than a year? Do you think it is better to go from one laboratory exam to another, from hospital to hospital, with the child guessing more and more the truth. and to be in anguish at the end? And all for nothing. Do you always talk so openly to your patients? Not always. But I am an unhappy old man, who thought for once, with my last patient, I would deliver my true, complete opinion. What do you mean, your last patient? Two years ago, I was going to retire, but there was always much to do. And nowadays there are so many things, perhaps the younger ones can withstand all the frustrations better than I can. I don't understand. I don't know . . . Today, people go to the moon, but they cannot research adequately what is needed to save lives. Every time they fire off a space rocket, they've spent enough money to build five hospitals, and you still do not understand? For the moment, this is no concern of yours. One day you may make it your concern. But now, you must take advantage of this opportunity. You call this an opportunity? Yes. Imagine that you've just been born, and with a son who is ten years old, and that both of you have six months to live. Six months to live. Six months is a long time, when you might never have had a single day, or opportunity to be together at all. Take advantage of your time. Do what pleases you. Be happy. And that's all that's left to do? Yes . . . to be happy. Make him happy. Give Pascal the happiest six months a child ever had. Not the twelve months with the doctors? I can't help you there. No one can. I've already decided. When can you take him away? In a few days. It's better if I don't go with you. Maybe later. If you ever need something, I can take care of him. It's about time I did. It's good that you get the chance. It all seemed so wonderful, and now . . . And you? They found nothing? I was in the water. It acts like a shield. But why must we leave Paris, when all the others are returning to school? That's what I wanted to talk to you about. At the hospital they told me that I'm not well. Nothing serious, but doctors believe that I should go to the country. That's it. In Herod, you will be better. There everyone gets better. Verdun told me . . . . . . the water is so healthy. I hope this is true. Verdun is right. I will soon be well. I will help you. I know. It's why I brought you along. I was afraid of getting bored on my own. We will not be bored! We will organize everything perfectly! I knew I could count on you. Will Catherine be coming? Maybe later. Good health! Hi Laurent. Regards, Pascal! Hello! Hi, Charlie! I don't know why I'm so sleepy! I always liked that part. Magnificent invention. What do we do if the lid does not open? We'll have to buy a new car. Dad, that's ridiculous! Or we could try to break it open. Oh, you! I never know when you're joking. I promise that I'll improve! Why don't we have a tractor? Here, Pascal. What? Are you thinking of going in for farming? No, I want to ride in the woods. A great idea! What kind would like to have? OK! That's enough! A blue one! Big or small? Medium! But I would like it to be blue. Goodbye, Charlie! --See you, Pascal! Monsieur! Good evening, sir. Good evening, Marinette. Good evening. Dinner is ready. Soup . . . . . . his favorite. Shhh, he's asleep. Verdun! Are you here? Yes, here I am! Hello, Verdun! Hi, Pascal! How are you? I'm so glad to see you. You need a haircut. Are you here for long? Dad says until we get bored. For the vacation! Yes. You are still without running water? I could have had it, but I changed my mind. Why? --When you have a spring, with nature's own water, who needs it? Go and get a clean glass. That's it, drink it. Good for you, it will put hair on your chest. Aaagh! What do you mean, Aaagh. It's good. It will get rid of rheumatism, or the gout. I've never seen you wear that shirt before. That's because you've never seen me in St Tropez, when I am with my friend Robert, the one with the smart hotel. You should see me, wearing that, and looking at all the elegant gentlemen . . . and beautiful ladies! Caviar for Madame? Right away. Ahhh, bleu? Bleu. --Naturally. And what will you drink? Champagne. Here you are. Oh! It's alright. And what will you give me? Another glass of water. Go on, finish it off. Could we go crayfish hunting some time? No thank you, no water. I'm not thirsty! Oh you! You'll die an idiot. If you had invested in my mineral water, you'd have made another fortune by now. Right. Well talk about it some other time. --You've been saying that for the last twenty years. OK, now let's talk about more serious things. I heard a conversation about crayfishing. Do you want to go? --Well, not today. Today we're going to Clermont. What are you going to do there? You'll see. Will you come with us? --In the Rolls? --Of course. OK, then I will put on a tie. My red one. Do you think it will go with this outfit? Lovely! Wait a minute. Here? . . . You're crazy! Just for a moment . . . Madame Fournier! Madame Fournier! Yes, it's me! It's me! Oh . . . What a beautiful car! Here you are. Now you can go. Yes, sir. The old girl, she goes for your magic water? She buys one each week. One glass first thing every morning, and no rheumatism or gout. Yes! But it's not fair . . . So . . . Wait for me in the square. I will get out here. Another big deal? Important clients? Yes, this time for the pharmacy. Look! Ahhh, it is a really important client. Meet us at Giro. Pascal wants to choose a tractor. A tractor? . . . Why not! A tractor, a space ship, anything. Here. Take it. Dad! If you are sick, then why I am taking medication? I take them for the same reason. Besides, haven't you heard of preventive medicine? I've heard. I'm always cold in this weather! I'm not surprised. Summer's over. I'll have another blanket sent up. Thank you, Dad. --Remember your prayers. Do you pray? Well, yes. Good night, Pascal. --Good night, Dad. Sleep well. Brrr. I'm cold! I'm freezing to death! Thank you, Dad. Mr S?gur? Father isn't here, but it doesn't matter. I know how to ride. I am the driver of the tractor. Tractor? It is not possible. Be careful. This is not a game. Do you know what we need? A trailer! A trailer? Why? To haul away the earth we've got to take out of the basement! Because Verdun and me, we're looking for treasure. So you can see how much dirt we'll have to dig out. And you can guess who will be doing the digging. All right, we'll get a trailer! Blue, don't forget! Of course, blue. Bye! Hi, Marinette, come and ride with me. Tractor, trailer. You'll spoil the boy! If he goes across the lawn, and tears up all the flowers, then what? They'll grow again. They'll grow again! Little Verdun, eh? Well, I just thought the business would go to Hell if I wasn't there. All right. Call me tomorrow at the same time. Goodbye. Hey! Look at me! Turn off the engine! I'm sorry. Excuse me, Monsieur Vernet. It's nothing. Nice to see you back, Pascal. Thank you. Do you have a tractor? No. I prefer my horses. What is his name? Storm. He is the fastest of all. How many stallions do you have? Oh, about ten. You must come and see them. I'd like that. What is that thing around Storm's neck? Questons, questions! A wolf's tooth. If you hang one around a horse's neck, he can run all day and never grow tired. Do you believe in wolves? Yes, and many more things. If you carry the heart of a turtledove wrapped in a piece of wolf's skin, a man loses all desire. Do you carry one? Age has the same effect. It's only Verdun. --Whoa, hold it, Storm. Hello, Verdun! Hi, Pascal! I think Storm wants to go home. See you soon. Come again! Tomorrow we can go fishing! How is Monsieur Vernet? Oh, he's fine. He believes in wolves, and has ten stallions. Say, didn't you forget something? What? --Your new toy. You want to leave it to spend the night outside? OK, I'll put it away. I want to check the oil. We're so lucky. Every day is a holiday. You'll get your fingers caught. Take it this way, by the middle! Did you know that in Paris I was nearly bitten by a wolf? In Paris? Where? At the zoo. There aren't any wolves here? Of course not. Would they be able to live here? Of course! They once lived here. When you were little? Even before that. Look at me! Aren't you fishing? With a camera? Now that you know how, take your trap over there, under that tree. All right. I'll go with you! No, no, Laurent. Let him live his own life. You're going to make a sissy out of that boy. Seventy-two, seventy-three, seventy-four . . . . . . Two hundred and eighteen, two hundred and nineteen . . . you're getting me all mixed up. Excuse me, sir! Here, Pascal. --No! --Yes. Seventy-seven, seventy-eight . . . Twenty-two, twenty-three . . . Pascal! Go upstairs, take a hot bath, then put those on. In a minute! Twenty-six, twenty-seven . . . No! You bother me with your Rolleiflex and flash! What!? He's taken enough photos for today! Well, do not be angry. I'm not angry. But yes, you're angry! You have a nasty temper, you know. He just wants to take your picture. Nothing wrong with that. Pascal! What has happened to him? Pay no attention. He needs a good slap on his bottom. I think it's time you give it to him. I told you, pay no attention. Pay no attention! You let him get away with everything. Tractor, trailer, is it not so? You're spoiling him. It's none of my business, but I hate to see a good kid growing up without any guts. Verdun! Pascal's not going to grow up without any guts. Pascal isn't going to grow up at all. He's sick! Incurable! He will die soon! Don't say things like that to me, crazy things like that. Anyone can get sick, even very sick. There is a cure for anything these days. Well, almost anything. There is no cure for what he has? Not yet. Leukemia. The plane that crashed, I told you about it. The parachute, the bomb. And the people who dropped it? They are dead. --So they should be. And people do not know that the kid has been killed? Maybe a few of them, I don't know. But you are going to tell them. And shout it out, for everyone to hear! No, not now. If the whole world could hear, then Pascal would hear. You don't want to shout? You have a boy of ten years, who didn't do anything, who is innocent, who was well, and now has to die, because God doesn't care about this rotten world? Dear God! Verdun, what you want from me? You are my friend. Yes, I know. The doctor - an expert, right? The best. And what did he tell you? He told me to be happy, and make Pascal happy. I know. You must be. And you, too. You're right. We must try. We must be very careful, because Pascal is not stupid. You think he will understand? But I already understand. I told you never to eavesdrop. Now why did you do it? You were talking about me. I wanted to hear the rest. You only needed to come in. --Then you would have stopped talking. Well, come on in, it's cold out there. I did what you told me - I changed my socks. Listen, what we were talking about, Verdun and I, is not certain. It's only a doctor's opinion. They are very often mistaken, believe me. Not this time. I thought I heard it at the hospital. What? You mean somebody told you? No, not really. I heard the nurses talking that were on the night shift. I couldn't sleep sometimes because I was so cold. They said what a terrible shame it was about me. It doesn't prove anything. And the old doctor, the one with a beard, you know, he came to see me the last day, and told me I could leave, because I was cured. But when he left, I saw that he cried. It still doesn't prove anything. I'm not too smart, but I'm not very stupid for my age, either. There are other things . . . Shit, I'm going home. I've got better things to do than listen to this nonsense. What better things, for instance? Getting myself good and totally drunk. Go and drink yourself through the floor! Don't get upset, Dad. We'll manage. Hello, Marinette Hello, Monsieur "I love you" I slept marvelously well! So did I. You've gotta take 'em, buddy. Oh, you! You're not sick, are you. No. --I'm glad for that. What shall we do today? Whatever you like. I don't know. I think this is for you. For me? Mail? Is it something to eat? No, it's a book. Aaaaaah. A book about wolves! What do you know! "NATURAL HISTORY. Complete works of Buffon." And there's a letter inside. It's from Catherine. Catherine! I can't read it all at once. One thing at a time. Start at the first page. Great book! She's nice, isn't she? Yeah, I got that impression. "When the wolves mate, they mate for life." "If one of them dies, the one who survives will never seek a new mate." Imagine! Here, you read for a bit. Let's see . . . No, these letters are too small for me. You have to wear glasses. I never thought about it. But I manage. How? I just don't read. Tell me, your clever Monsieur Buffon, does he tell about the keepers of the wolves? No, but what is it about? Yes . . . I'm getting a bit cold, too. We'd better go into the house. --Good. So, this man, he was a wizard. A wizard? Yes. He had a pack of wolves, and when he was angered, he let them loose. Everyone was afraid of him, of course. Tell me more . . . You see, your Buffon doesn't know everything, eh? Then night came and . . . Go on, go on! What happened at night? There was a knocking at the door. Who was it? No one knew. You'd go to open the door, and there stood a man with a red hat and red gloves. That was the keeper of the wolves! Ah! Marinette. Go on, go on. His face was pale and . . . he smelled like a wolf. So all the animals on the farm - the horses, sheep, dogs, they trembled. But he said nothing. He ate what was given to him, but in silence. He then prepared a place to sleep, and then, in the morning . . . What happened in the morning? He disappeared. And nothing remained, only the smell of the wolf. The people would then throw salt on the fire. Salt on the fire? Yes, salt, to ward off evil spirits. And the flame was as green as grass! So! Ehhh, I'm not sure it will work, you know. You see! Does this not prove that my story is true? That's enough with my salt. Leave him. It's a good sign. Salt in the fire! You'll never expire! Leave a little for Marinette. And anyway, it's time to go to sleep. Another story about wolves? To bed! Why aren't you complaining of the cold today. I know, only now I'm steaming hot. Feel. Anyway, you have to sleep. Well, I'm already a bit tired. Oh, my book! You know, Verdun, one day we will get together to write a book about wolves. Yes, one day . . . I'll give it some thought. Good night, Marinette! Good night Verdun. --Good night, boy! That boy is nicer every day. He will be a fine . . . Yes, sir. He should be back by now. Try the library. No, he is running a temperature, around 103. No, perfectly behaved. Continue to take cortisone and injections. Right. Doctor, have you ever tried to stop a ten-year-old from running around all day? That's right. Thank you. Good bye. What did he say? What is expected. Too hot, too cold, completely exhausted. That's the pattern. Nothing else to do for the moment? Nothing. Only to give him his pills, his injections, and pray. Pills, injections, and pray. Bastards! It didn't hurt? --You're getting so good at injections. I wish it wasn't so hot. Or is it me? No, it is hot. I'll turn the heat down. Would you like a cold drink? You'd better go to sleep. It's late. I will, but first you go to sleep. Sure I can't get you something to drink? Lemonade? Scotch and water? If you want something, you let me know. Aha, there is something. Yes! There is something. What is it? Are you going to get it for me? All right. So what is it? I want a wolf! Yes, thanks. I tried everywhere. There is a man in Paris, you can ask him anything. He is Corsican, and works in the cinema. Maybe you remember him, he was with us in the Resistance. You need a submarine, anything special like that, he'll get it for you. I believe that he can find us a wolf. Why don't you call him? I've already done it. So only a madman keeps wild beasts at home. I've got a jaguar, at 12 rue Rodier, a kangaroo, a boa constrictor. But, that wolf you want, that will be very tough. Nobody's interested in wolves any more. Ohhh. It's very . . . dark in here. Wolves prefer the darkness. They do. Come here. You call that a wolf? What do you mean? I ordered a wolf. Oh, you wanted a bigger one. A wolf. A wolf! Do you have any other wolves? It's not exactly . . . Well, until next time, goodbye. Fifi, Fifi, come here, Fifi . . . In the meantime, I've been making other plans. Well, don't just stand there. Tell us. I went for a walk . . . in the zoo. Steal a wolf from the zoo? You are crazy. And what is wrong with that? A wolf would be better off in the country, and if Pascal wants one, I'll do anything I can to get him one. And you, you'll get eighteen months. No, because if the police catch me, I will say that we're at war. If he says no, then I'll ask him why the hell during a time of peace do they allow airplanes to carry a bomb that can fall and kill a child. All right, all right. The zoo. It's going to be like old times again. The Resistance. Yes, but we're not going to blow up the zoo. The gates - how high? No chance. We have to climb over the fences. OK, we will need a ladder, aluminum if possible. Thick gloves, steel saw, cutters . . . What else? Sleeping pills. Chloroform for the wolf . . . We haven't much time to get these things. Well, we can split it up. There's two of us. That's the trouble with men. They just don't know how to count. I think they don't eat at night. --Try the chloroform. There's no time for chloroform. Give it to me, I will give him an injection. We'll have to take the other one, too. Can you drive all right? Of course. A drop of whisky never hurts. I feel like a young man again. Yes, we should do this more often. From the look on your face, I'd say you've got it. They could not be separated. One day you and I can be like them. Bye! Good luck, all four of you! Bye. The usual, please. The owner is still asleep, and I haven't got the keys to the pump. Call him by phone. Sir, which way did you come? From there. So, from Paris? Yes. --Your documents. Yes, but we've never needed documents here. This is Mr S?gur, from the Chateau up the hill. You have heard of Chateau Herod? Do you know them? Go call the owner, Charlie, he knows us. Well? I only work here before I go to school. It is likely that the owner knows. I would say so. Sir, do you know how to read? Can you tell us what this is about? Someone robbed the station thirty kilometres down the road. Now do you understand? Your documents. They are in there. And you? My American passport is up at the Chateau. Would my driver's license do? It's in here. Open the trunk. I'd like to take a look. Well, the key's on the same ring . . . I can't do everything at once. Quiet, you. If you were a horse, do you think you'd like the Beatles? Whoa, whoa! Dad? Is that you? I did not want to wake you. Go back to sleep. Did you get him? How did you know? Because you both went out. You wanted to get me a wolf. Go back to sleep. Don't be afraid. I'm your friend. There's a good fellow. You've got nothing to worry about. Good boy. Don't be afraid. Nobody's going to hurt you. What are you called? Aren't you beautiful. What are their names? I don't know. It's up to you to name them. I'm glad we have them here with us. They'll protect us. From what? They'll just protect us. Are you afraid? Not when I'm with you and Verdun. It seems that wolves are never afraid. It's time for you to get back to bed. It's cold down here. No . . . But I am almost well again, aren't I? Almost. Those two are better than any medicine. Hey, y'know what I'll call them? Adam and Eve. He's Adam, and she's Eve. It's great. Looks like her teeth were clean enough. It's more than a week has gone by now. I can't hear a thing. Hi, Catherine! I'm good. How are you? I have a surprise for you, in fact, two surprises. How? . . . You mean you know? I know everything. And do you recognise them? They know me well. These are the wolves we saw. Pascal, you go on like that, and we'll all be behind . . . Yes, Catherine, I understand. Do not worry. Wait, I want to turn the page. This is the book you sent me. When are you coming down to see them? As soon as I can get away. Yes, on Christmas. Yes. Call me whenever you like. Good bye, and love to everybody. Bye, Catherine! That was Catherine! She will come for Christmas! Imagine, she already knows everything. Naturally. She helped us get them. She did? --Look, you can go outside today, if you wrap up and keep warm. And your tractor needs a good run! First, I might go see my wolves. As you like. It's not easy to make a choice. It'll be great one day: I'll be able to take the wolves on the back of my tractor. How do you like it? Watch - No hands! What are you doing? Not so fast! What are you doing? One for Eve. One for Adam. Butcher still wonders why we need so much meat. Tell him it's for the dogs. I am deaf. Makes it easy not to answer him. You and Dad, stealing the wolves - You must have been very scared. We were, but just enough to make it work. Here we go. You carry it for me, keeper of the wolves. When will I be able to feed them? Not yet, but you will soon. You know what? We'll give them some of your mineral water. Yes, it is not a bad idea! What makes you think they'd want it? It's not bad . . . OK, let's go! Oh, look. The first snow! Make a wish! Here! Then I'll make one for you. "Dogs by nature live in packs, Wolves, on the contrary, live alone, But sometimes create brief alliances for war and for hunting. But once their prey is devoured, they . . ." Listen, how will we manage to finish by Christmas? It's still five weeks! The way you're working, it will take five months. Now, put it on while it's hot, then back into the fire. You'd better come right away. We have a problem with the wolves! Oh no! Adam fell into one of the old wells. --Is something broken? I don't know. I only know that he's still alive. The wells are not deep, but very, very narrow. Pascal, this will be a job for you. Carefully, slowly, that's it. Now, you go and talk to Eve, while we take care of her stupid husband. Eve, we will take care of him. Don't worry, everything will be fine. God, it reeks of chloroform. I'm going to get some air in here. Come. Come here. Don't worry, Eve. Don't worry, Adam will recover. Yes. Pascal, can you hold this for me? Of course. That's a good boy. Good boy. Bravo, Pascal, we are finished! Everything's going to be all right! How is he? I don't think it's broken, but just in case, we'll use the plaster of Paris. Sleep Adam, everything will be fine! Don't worry, sleep! I think we need Catherine to help us. I bet she's great with animals! I will talk to her about it. Laurent, do not do it. You're crazy. Eve, come here! Come here, Eve! You're a good wolf. Wolves are good. Come here! Loyal, brave, intelligent. Come, Eve! No one will hurt you, come! So . . . Good girl . . . See, it's good. You see? This is to show you I'm not that crazy. After today, I don't think we'll ever need them. Sir, Monsieur Vernet is here. Coming. Pascal, you better get up. I told him that you were busy and he might have to wait. He said it was fine. Well, thank you! Sorry, Vernet, Marinette just told me you were here. I came to see your son. Hi, Pascal, you look great. Do I? I'm going to die soon. Really? Me, too. What's the difference. Next week, next year, your time comes. As long as it doesn't stop you enjoying yourself. Oh, I'm enjoying myself. Good day, Monsieur. I'm having fun with my tractor. And I, with my horses. Calm down, Storm! I wanted you to come over to see me break in a young stallion. I'd like that. Is he black like him? --No, white. How long does it take to train him properly? Pascal, enough questions. Three or four months. He still has a wolf's tooth. He is never without it. Can I touch it, just once? Yes, of course. Are you all right? -Yes, just grab him quickly! Watch out! Watch out, Storm . . . Now . . . Come on . . . Storm! Watch out! Enough, enough! Take me to my home, immediately, I'll tell my people to look for him. Verdun, was it our fault? We must smell like polecats; worse, we must smell too much like wolves. One for Eve, one for Adam. I think I will go to bed early. You know, walking through all that snow is tiring. Yes, you're right. Tomorrow morning there will be six inches more snow. And Monsieur found a turkey. A beautiful one, a real brute. Do you think it will last until Christmas? This I promise you. They were probably hungry. Here we go. I'll do it myself today. Well, as you want. Perhaps I'd better. They'd probably like me to. Of course. Why don't you separate it into two bowls. Verdun, I need your advice about that electricity. I do not like it when you go down there alone. I'm not alone. I've got my wolves. That's what I mean. Shall I go with you? Marinette, women and wolves don't mix! I'm sorry. Yes, you are beautiful. Don't move. You see, he recovered. Your foot would not have recovered so quickly, right? If I had to walk again, to hunt food and survive I would have done the same. But your bones can not heal as fast as Adam's? No, not so fast. Thank you, Verdun. It's important for me to know that. Verdun! Old man Vernet and his men have spotted that escaped stallion. They want us to help bring him in. Can I come? In this weather? You're as crazy as the stallion. I will stay with Pascal. We have to finish our Christmas gift. Don't say anything! I said nothing. You're all very mysterious. See you later. Did you know that wolves have an extra toenail? It is better to say that dogs have one less, which atrophied during the last few thousand years. Hey, you read my book! You cheated, you said you couldn't read. I said that I didn't, not couldn't. But what about wolves? Let them sleep an hour or two. Now? Wolves stay awake at night. How do you know? I'll tell you this. I'll never leave it out again! I've already read it. Not now. It is dark. You might miss. Thank you, Laurent. Come in, Marinette will get us something to eat and drink. No - "Tu!" You must do "Tu-tu." Isn't that right, madame? What time is it, what's happening? I'd like to get up. You're crazy, it's four o'clock. I can't sleep. Can I lie in bed beside you? Only if you lie still enough. What happened to the lower part of your pajamas? Nothing. --Have you had a nightmare? No, I don't think so. Did you know that it's snowing? Sleep, you little monster. You forgot to turn out the light. That never happened before, you know. It's nothing. It does not matter. Sleep. Thank you. Good night, Dad. Good night my warrior. I told you that it's snowing? You've already told me that. I forgot. Did you know that Catherine is coming tomorrow? Yes, I know. Sleep. You and Marinette can move his bed into my room. I would not worry so much. Consider it done. This failure of the body, I tell you, it's a final warning. Come on, just because a kid wets his bed . . . For God's sake, don't you understand? If this happens in his sleep, this is due to fear, not his illness. It's subconscious. The boy is afraid inside. You are wrong. Sleeping or not sleeping, I've never seen anything like that Pascal for guts. Laurent, I tell you, this kid has outdistanced us. Yes, that's true. You're right. And that's a fine way to put it. But I'm right, too, because I'm his father. Last night I finally realized that all this time I had hoped for a miracle, and also last night I understood that there will be no miracles. Not for my Pascal. Not for my boy. Monsieur isn't well. You'd better go with him to the station. I think Pascal needs me, too. If you are that concerned, why not take him back to the doctor in Paris? No. This place, the snow, his wolves . . . I really think it's like a fairy story to him, except for the 'happily ever after' part. Every time I see one of those damn things, I wonder whether it's carrying passengers and their luggage, or something that could destroy a city. I hope he'll be happy to see me again. You'll see. Catherine! Are you satisfied? A shame. Poor Storm. Poor old horse. What are you saying? I say that if you can find a tree now, then you and Verdun can chop it down later. You can count on me! Did you hear something last night? That's a stupid question. No need. I saw the footprints this morning. It's a full moon. And where is Pascal? I don't know. He went out with the tractor. Oh my God! Laurent! Laurent! The kid! Help! Help! Dad! Help! Dad! Dad! Dad! You let them out? --Yes. And they were waiting for it. Now you see why I wanted wolves? You're right, I won't argue again. Run along! This is not for you to see. Verdun! Don't shoot my wolves! Catherine! Catherine, it's not fair! He didn't kill me. The wolves would have killed him! But it's not the same. It was the kindest thing to do. Check. Checkmate. Another game? Tomorrow, I'm a bit tired. I'm not surprised. I have never beaten you before in chess. No, you haven't. You didn't let me win, did you? No, honestly, I would never. I might have been thinking about other things. I was too, so that makes us even. You see, I'm concerned about my wolves. Why? They're doing well. But I fear that they have awful troubles. What will happen to them, once I'm dead? For the moment, you're still here. Suppose I die soon. You can't send them back to the zoo. I wouldn't want to. But if they are released into the forest, they might start attacking the cows, and farmers would get their guns and kill my wolves. What do you think about it? Frankly, I don't think about it. If you want my opinion, we should do nothing. Each day will take care of itself, and each wolf will find its own destiny, like you find yours and I find mine. Y'know, that's true. You make me feel a little better. There is no reason to worry. You're right. We'll manage. You know, you said that to me once before. Did I? It really helped me. I'm glad for that. The first time I saw you together at Maxim's, I could not believe that you would be so close. Hell of a way to learn the joys of fatherhood. You're cynical and tired. A good night's sleep will erase it all. Yes, I'm tired. Because I feel so useless. I can do so little. You know, I never really thought about death. It's something old people do. I was not prepared for it. Do you understand? Laurent, I asked you before. Pascal, these last few months, has he been happy? It was all like a miracle. Of course, you never know what happens in the mind of a child. No, I wouldn't say he was unhappy. So, you have no right to be unhappy. You're the most wonderful father. I've never seen anything like it. Shhh, don't wake him up. He doesn't need a woman now. Timber! This is a beautiful Christmas tree, not too large nor too small. This is called the average tree. It was planted on your birthday. It's the same age that I am. Can you imagine that? You going to tow it in yourself, Pascal? Of course, it's my tractor. Come on, climb up. We hooked up the chain. Marinette, climb on, I'll drive you. Go, lumberjack, go! Hey, you! Bravo, Verdun! Excellent! Wait, that's not all. I'm going to fix them so that they flash on and off, on and off. It won't break them? Not a chance. Now you'll see. Pascal, run and get me another can of this. You want it now? I am a bit tired. You know you're not alone. We all need to rest. And you promise me you'll get a good nap this afternoon, and be ready for tomorrow. All right. And you won't cheat, and try to see what's inside the package. If you promise that you will not try to look at my gift for you! It's a surprise! Trust me. Laurent, if you want to get back before dark, we'd better hurry. I'm coming. Where are you going? Last-minute shopping. Look. On and off, like I said. Wonderful! Bravo! Remember, take that nap! All right. Goodbye, Dad, drive carefully. I wouldn't call it cheating if I guess that was a bicycle. You shouldn't look at what I'm doing. You wouldn't want to find out. Y'know, I think it's got a motor on it. No, you did not see anything. Christmas Eve, it never changes. If only that were true. What are you doing now? Oh, no! A red glove! Oh, Verdun, you don't mean . . . There is no point in hiding it now. After your nap this afternoon, We'll dress you up as a surprise. Oh, great. Terrific! Are you sure he really dressed this way? I guarantee it. --Smashing Bravo! The keeper of the wolves! You see, she recognised the costume. Of course, because I made it. The old liar. She only sewed it a little. Don't listen to him. He's a liar, a boaster, a lazy one. Never got anything right in his life. You're not going to answer her back? She is too deaf to argue with. I'm going to get dressed now. I want to be elegant for tonight. You going to wear your shirt from St Tropez? Of course! Verdun! --Yes? I wish I could tell you what a . . . What? Oh, nothing. You want to help me? I have to go see my wolves. Stay with me, and you can taste the chocolate mousse. I'll take care of the wolves. Stay here. If you want me to. Pascal, you little character. Now, you had no right to open your presents. Pascal stop playing the fool. I can see you . . . "Good luck!"
