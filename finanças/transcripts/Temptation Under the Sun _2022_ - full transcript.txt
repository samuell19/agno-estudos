King all day. That's right. Cass, listen to me. You need to stay out of this, okay? You can't... Time of death was between midnight and 2 a.M. Was he with you through the night as well? No. I was back at my hotel around midnight. Word of advice, detective cruz. Go home to detroit. Forget you ever met this man. - [travis scoffs] - book him. I saw someone arguing with the victim yesterday. Yesterday morning at minerva's. He was a tall man, and he was wearing a panama hat. Well, you have my attention, detective. How about we step into my office? Cassady: And then he left. That's when I spoke to minerva. She tried to brush it off, but I could tell that it was serious. You said you couldn't hear anything they said. No, but it was the way they were talking. I mean, he grabbed her arm. But you never saw his face. No. Like I said, he was standing in the shadows Faced away from me, wearing a hat, like I told you. You know, half the men on this island wear panama hats. And this argument could have been about anything. Maybe he was a poor tipper. A bill perhaps. "island politics." - I'm sorry? - That's what she said. She said, "there's less to fight about down here, And that's why we treasure every square inch." Hmm. Well, what do you think she meant by that? I don't know. [sighs] I see. Okay. Well, um, I'm sorry, detective. I just don't think There's really is enough to go off of here. You're not gonna look into it? I mean, maybe she had a business relationship with this person. You should look into her phone, Her records, her bank statements. We do know how to conduct an investigation down here, Detective. I'm sorry. Look, If travis did this, what is his motive? Travis and the deceased were former lovers. It ended badly. Come on, as a cop, you certainly know how many women Have been murdered by their exes. I really appreciate you bringing this to my attention. But if there's nothing else, I really must get back to work. [sighs] When's the arraignment? Tomorrow morning. Are you planning to attend? It's looking more and more likely. Thank you. [up-tempo caribbean music playing] Not that I particularly mind you buying me piña coladas All day, but-- Do you think he did it? Travis? You're mad. Not in a million years. He and minerva, two peas in a pod. Besides, he doesn't have a violent bone in his body. That's what I thought. Look, gal, Don't take this the wrong way, but...You just met him. Why you care so much? I--I don't. I'm just--I'm a-- I'm a police officer. I'm not just gonna stand by While an innocent man gets railroaded. Is there another reason? What other reason will be there? I don't know. I thought maybe you fancy him. There he is. - Sean? - Mm-hmm. Winston: That's who we spying on? How does you even know he here? I'm a detective, remember? Winston: What is it you detect? That he's got a woman here he comes to visit Every time he gets a paycheck. In there? How do I not know these things? I does live here. Sean is a piece of work, but... Murder? I don't know. I bumped into him at the station, And he said, "I told him he shouldn't have messed with me." That sounds a lot like an admission of guilt to me. He's on the move. Let's go. This is a bad idea. Look at that. Must be a payoff. I knew he was dirty. So is every cop on the island. What do you mean? Some of the senior officers just like to pretend They above taking bribes. So they get guys like sean to do it for them. It's a side hustle. [continues, indistinct] Senior officers. Like... Chief inspector dexter? Especially him. So, who does sunglasses work for? The real people that runs the island. A bunch of old-money families that made their fortune Off of sugar cane back in the day. Now all they just care about Is making sure the tourist dollars keep flowing in. You know who these people are? Everybody does know. You met one of them. Constable lynch. Cassady. You really think sean killed minerva To get back at travis? I don't know, But I'm gonna find out. Lucky you have someone looking out for you. Can you uncuff him, please? Did you pay my bail? Most of it, but she paid the rest. Thank you. Both of you. King, you better be here Thursday morning bright and early. Oh, yeah? What happens Thursday morning? It's your preliminary hearing. Preliminary hearing? Oh, man, that's the same thing as sentencing. I know. Come. Let's go. I'll drop you two off before my next charter. - Cass, you coming? - Yeah. I'm coming. [exhales] [snickers] This is why I don't like cops. No respect for private property. No offense. None taken. [travis exhales] Does this happen often? Whenever dexter thinks I'm guilty of something. So yeah. It happens pretty often. Minerva and dexter have a history? Yeah. Why? I think he might be the man that I saw arguing with her The morning before her murder. Wait. You think dexter may have been the one who killed her? Didn't you just tell winston that you thought it was sean? Maybe he had him do it for him. I don't know. I just-- My gut is telling me That the chief inspector is definitely involved. They were lovers. Till she dumped him for me. And as you can guess, he didn't take it very well. Understandable. Huh. But, I mean, that was six years ago. Why would he wait so long to get even? Well... Okay. We go over dexter's head. There's gotta be a politician, a prosecutor, Someone who's willing to talk to us, who'll listen. Cass, you don't understand how things work around here. Winston told me, but...I'm not buying it. If the cops won't talk to us, let's--let's call the embassy, Get the state department to pull some strings. I don't think that's gonna work either. Why not? Kind of had a little-- Little... Trouble with the irs. It's, uh--[chuckles] It's kind of the reason I came down here. [sighs] and I thought it was for the scenery. Okay, it wasn't for the scenery, all right? [sighs] I'm not a criminal. My accountant was. And the feds came after me. Wanted me to pay back all these taxes, A lot of money that my accountant stole. I spent everything that I had on lawyers, But they just-- they just kept coming after me. They kept harassing me. I just thought, "you know, It would just be easier if I left the country," so... I did. It's looking a lot like I'm, uh-- Like I'm heading to prison either way. Fine. I thought you wanted to actually catch the person Who murdered your friend, but I guess you don't care. No, that's not it at all. I care, cass. Well, of course I care. Then why are you acting like you've already given up? Because you don't know dexter like I do. Trust me. He is not gonna let anybody get in his way, And I just don't want-- I don't want you to become collateral damage. This is not my first time going up against someone Who thinks they can get away with murder. Okay? I'm a cop. I don't need you to protect me. I don't need you to protect me either. [sighs] Okay. There has got to be someone who will talk to us, Who knew her and who cares that she's dead. [sighs] Wait a minute. I forgot. Forgot what? Marley. Who's marley? Detective inspector marley. He was minerva's godfather. If anyone's got a reason to help us, It's gotta be him. [people chattering] [indistinct audio] Pastor: Thank you all for being here In the presence of our heavenly father To celebrate the life of minerva st. James. She was taken from us far too soon, But her light that was the gift to all who knew her Can never be extinguished. Let us pray. You got a lot of nerve showing your face here today. Marley, she was my friend. Is this how you treat your friends? I didn't kill her. That's for the court to decide. She won't find justice in a courtroom. You of all people should know-- - What are you implying? - [winston clears throat] Meet me at her bar after the service. Please. [birds squawking] Hold on. I'll get the rest of the lights. Hey. You okay? Yeah. Just, uh-- It feels like she's still here, you know. [footsteps approaching] Okay. Here I am. Make it quick. I just buried my goddaughter. I'd like to remember her in private. We understand. And we wanna help you by finding who's responsible. Who are you exactly? Cassady cruz. Detroit pd. You're a long way out of your jurisdiction, miss cruz. And what makes you think We haven't already found the murderer? Hey. I already told you I-I-I didn't do it. Marley, I loved her. You know that. What I know is she was killed with your knife. Obviously, whoever did it, they took the knife from my boat. Convenient. We think ian dexter might be involved. That's ridiculous. Ian's no killer. And we've been friends for years. Or you've just been part of the same racket. Getting paid off by the same people. I don't have to take that from some tourist. - I'm not just a tourist. - If you don't live here, It's none of your damn business. I understand. You don't wanna do anything That might jeopardize your little financial arrangement. Travis: Okay. Hey. - Cool it. - Take your hands off me. Winston: Marley! Hey. Cass, will you calm down. Don't tell me to calm down. If we don't do something, you're going to go to jail And someone's going to get away with murder. Cass, you're just not understanding it. There may not be anything that we can do. Oh, so you're just gonna sit tight in your little bungalow Until they come to lock you up. I didn't say that. I just think-- [sighs] Hey! Hey, where are you going? I have my own cases to work. - Oh. Now who's giving up? - Hey. I tried. You just don't care enough for it to be worth my while. Oh, yeah? What about us? Look, I...

[clears throat] okay. Just reach up. Here we go. - It's too far. - It's too far. Okay, let me just reposition here. - Okay, you ready? - Yeah. - All right, just get it. - Okay, yeah. Get it...Reach! - Oh! I'm trying! - Come on. - Come on. - There it is. - [grunting] - there it is. Hold on. Hold on--! [both grunt] Oops. Twenty-four hours. Trav! Travis! [sighs] Travis... What did you do now? Looking for your friend? I heard he took his boat out last night And didn't come back. Guess he was guilty after all. You know he's not. What's going on, sean? Where is he? You're asking the wrong guy. You feel so? So why your face black and blue like that? Your mom likes it rough. Sean: Stay safe out there! It's dangerous on the water. Well, this is just great. What are we supposed to do now? Must be some kind of old sinkhole or... [sighs] yes, I gathered that. How are we supposed to get out of it? Oh, there was a--there were some strong tree limbs up there. We could... No, we can't. We don't... Have a rope. Take off your shirt. I'm sorry, what? Whoa. [chuckles] you, uh... What are you doing? You said we needed a rope, right? Ah. Oh. [inhales] hmm. You know, I think I think we're gonna need more rope. ♪ it was 39 ♪ ♪ before the music started ♪ ♪ when you walked up to me and you said ♪ ♪ "hey, heads, we dance" ♪ ♪ well, I didn't know who you were ♪ ♪ until I saw... ♪ Okay, I'm gonna take my pants off now. - Okay. - All right. - All right, let's see it. - Okay. ♪ there was a picture of you ♪ ♪ a picture of you ♪ ♪ across the front page ♪ - Okay. - ♪ it looked just like you ♪ I think we might need just A little more...Rope.

We wouldn't be in this mess if it wasn't for me. ♪♪ [woman singing in spanish] ♪♪ So, uh... Are we gonna make a big deal about this? I haven't decided yet. Because, um... I like you. In more than a meaningless vacation fling kind of way. There we go. [sighs] It's not meaningless for me, either. No? [cell phone rings] I'll let it ring. [laughs] my phone! [both laugh] - Resilient. - Wow. So, you ready to try this again? I need like 15, 20 minutes and then I'll be-- I meant the rope. Oh, the rope, yeah. No, uh, that's-- That's what I was talking about, too. - [cassady laughs] - travis: All right. [groans] Told you I can climb a rope. No, it was very, very impressive. Hey, uh, So I'm really digging our island date here, But we don't have any food and we don't have any water And we're gonna die if we don't... Well, I'm up for a swim. - Can't wait. - A swim? Mm-hmm. Why swim when we could ride? Come on. - Winston! - Winston! - Winston, over here! - Over here! Winston! So you're starting to look like a rugged island girl. I like it. Cassady: Oh, my god. Winston. What's so urgent that you-- Everyone thinks you two are dead. Yeah. And, uh... We'd like to keep it that way. Okay. I need to know what's going on. You know what's happening. You just don't believe it. Your friend, chief inspector, Tried to kill us. [sighs] Yeah, he had the pieces of the wreckage that were found Confiscated before I could get a good look at them, but, I could tell they'd been burned. - Oh. - Like there was an explosion. Oh, like there was an explosion. That's funny, 'cause yeah, there was an explosion, 'cause he blew up my boat using c4, okay? With some kind of remote trigger thing. So it's true. He killed minerva. You believe us now? It doesn't matter what I believe. Dexter's running the investigation. He's calling the shots. We can't go through normal channels. What about the old money families - You say run the island? - What about them? I mean, if they're anything like the politicians We have in the states, then They hate anything that rocks the boat - Or threatens the status quo. - You're right about that. Hmm. I mean... He did just try to kill two american citizens, - Didn't he, now? - One of them a cop. If that's not rocking the boat, what is? We prove he behind all this bacchanal? They take him down for us. If that's how things are done around here, I guess we play along or get out of the game, right? That's right. Okay, so we can't prove that he tried to blow us up. What can we prove? There might be something. Earlier today, I caught dexter Reading a letter in his office. He told me it was a bill, but he was lying. It was from a company called island shore investment group. "there's less to fight about down here. That's why we treasure every square inch." Winston: What you mean by that? It's something minerva said to me. What if this is about real estate? - The bar. - Yeah. Them people always come around Trying to buy it out from under her. Where is this letter now? Marley: In his filing cabinet. Can you get to it? Maybe. But I'd need a distraction. Leave that to us. It's sean. Yeah, I followed marley like you said. You're not gonna believe who he just met up with. It's travis and that lady cop. They're still alive. - Hey, brother. - Hey. Are these the reports we were talking about? - Yes, sir. - Lead me through it, would you? - Just the bullet points. - Of course. [continues indistinctly] - Right. - Especially a search warrant. We do have a problem with that. Okay. - Marley: Right now? - Man: Yes, sir. -Thank you. Appreciate it. - Of course. ...If you just take a look into this, And also can assign... Hey, would you, um, do me a favor? Show this to johnson. - Okay. - Yeah? All right. Thanks. - Officer johnson? - Shit... Officer johnson? The report of the robbery last week. Is it complete yet? Yes sir, it's on my desk. - If you care to follow me? - Thank you. [reading under breath] I've got the letter. Cassady was right. They wanted the property minerva's bar was built on To build a condo development. Looks like dexter convinced them That he could talk her into selling it In exchange for a hefty finder's fee. That's why they were arguing. She wouldn't sell, so he killed her To protect his nest egg. That sounds about right. Travis: How soon can you get it here? Give me 15 minutes. Detective inspector. What is it, lynch? - I'm busy. - Apologies. But I need you to come with me. That's far enough. Where's my money? You have me at a disadvantage, friend. That's the point. And I'm not your little friend. No, you're not. But we do know each other, don't we? My money, or I take this evidence To the real people that does run the island. And then you can be friends with the sharks. If you're trying to get me to confess to something, You're wasting your time! I know you killed minerva. - I saw you. - Did you? Oh, I'd love to know how you managed that. I also know you plant a bomb on travis boat. Tell me I'm wrong. You know, you've been out in the sun A little too long... Winston. - That's not my name. - Sure it is. Why don't you take off the mask And let's discuss this like men. Fine. If you don't want to cooperate, then... - [gun cocks] - take off the mask. Or I pull the trigger. [sighs] That's better, isn't it? All right, tell your friends to come out. And don't try denying it. I know they're still alive. Travis! Can you hear me? No? Okay. Both of you come out now Or I finish him. That would be very stupid, chief inspector. Detective cruz. You know, you seem remarkably confident For someone with no weapon and no leverage. Leverage? Marley found your letter. Island shores investment group? Sound familiar? Drop the charges against travis, And let us all walk out of here Or we show that letter to the folks That paid for that nice car behind you. I don't think they'd be very happy to learn That you killed minerva and tried to kill two americans Over a private real estate deal That they were being cut out of. [cell phone rings] [cell phone rings] Constable lynch. What do you have for me? - I've got marley. - Excellent. Keep him on ice. I'll be there shortly. Now you were saying something about a letter? Going somewhere? Does this mean - What I think it means? - Yes. Dexter killed her so these island shore people Could acquire her bar from the estate sale. When travis and cassady got in the way, He blew up their boat. Lucky for us, it didn't work. "us"? Look... Your family pays me to protect their interests. So, I'm telling you, If you don't do something about dexter fast, He's gonna draw the kind of attention They don't want. [sighs] Where did you say this meet was taking place? Winston, Is he okay? I don't know. You know, sean, your friend seems a little nervous. He's fine. Just get us what you promised us. Oh, you'll get what I promised, and more. What he means is he'll kill you both The moment you're no longer useful to him. He can't let you live, sean. If the old money families find out any of this, he's done. All right, we've heard about enough out of you, detective. How could you do it, dex? [scoffs] you loved her. [scoffs] I know you did. Same as me. She was stubborn. Naive. She brought this on herself. No, she only put up with him Because she knew the danger Of alienating someone with his power and connections. I know how it works. I see it every day. Yeah, you won't see anything for much longer, detective. Take 'em out past widow's reef, Put a little chum in the water, Let the sharks take care of the bodies for us. What, you're not coming? I have to take care of a complication By the name of di marley. But there's three of them. So kill them here if it makes it easier on you. Sean: What, me? You said you'd do it. Do you want your money or not? He's using you, sean. Don't let him make you his scapegoat. - I want the money up front. - That's not gonna happen. Then they're not going anywhere, And neither am I. All right. [sighs] if you insist. [gunshots] Let him go. Let him go! On your knees. Now. You have quick reflexes. Not so bad yourself. What the hell did I miss? [both chuckle] [both sigh] It's okay. Marley told me everything. [sighs] good. You can deal with this. My pleasure. This way. Oh, and, uh, lynch, There's still the... [chuckles] The matter of my-- my murder charge. Since we know who the real killer is, I think we can consider it dropped. [sighs] - Thank you. - Forget it. My family appreciates the head's up On our friend here. Cassady: I just have one request. - What's that? - Whatever you do to him, Do it by the book. You have my word. Oh... There's another body over there. And that--that wasn't me, either. Just to be clear. ♪♪ Hey, cass, I was thinking We would swim out to...This... Cove. You're leaving. Yeah. I, um... I have-- I have unfinished business, At home. If I--if I don't go now, it'll be too late. I thought they took you off that case. Have you ever known me to back down from a fight? Besides, you-- you need to... Figure out what you want to do next. Yeah, no, um... I was kinda hoping that we could - Figure it out together. - Travis. I need some time. And so do you. - Yeah, no, yeah. - [chuckles] Okay.

So, consider this part of the thanks. You're welcome. [chuckles] - I'm quite early, I know. - Oh, that's okay. Would you like a drink? - I would love it. - I can make you a drink. Right. [sighs] So, uh, I heard that city councilman lost the election. Something about damaging allegations in the press? You've been keeping tabs on me. Does that mean you had something to do with it? Of course not. Leaking information about an ongoing investigation Is against the rules and I take my job Very seriously. So I hear. And so do you. Co-owner of a bar now, huh? [sighs] yep. After we found out minerva did actually have will, She left the bar to marley.
