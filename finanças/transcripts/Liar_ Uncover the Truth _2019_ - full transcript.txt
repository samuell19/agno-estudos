(Age 24) (Height 177cm) (Annual income 12 million yen) (Digital Creator Cute & Naughty) (Azusa Korono) Are you mocking me? I love your angry face. 12 million? He's younger than me, but he earns twice as much. Such a sweet, little tease. Don't tell me. Sakurai? Mr Katagiri. Aren't you going steady my college buddy? We broke up. Really? Don't laugh. So there's a chance for me to ask you out? (Age 29) (Height 180cm) (Yearly income 12 million yen) (Good-looking, smart, a financier) (Keima Katagiri) (Popular, social guy) (Keima Katagiri) He is so cool. Plus, he's an elite bond trader.

I told you, I was with Tsukada. This is from his social media. The day you were with him, he was in Hawaii, with his girlfriend. Kana, please forgive me. Nice guy, handsome, no parental obligations, earning 10 million p.a. Has savings of over 20 million yen. Even if he does cheat, he's still ideal marriage material. It's just a casual affair. I should forget it. - Let's split! - You're forgiven! It was only a fling with you. But I really enjoyed it. I'm the other woman? Yes, there's someone else. So I'm not your real lover? It's not how it looks. I'm in love with two girls. You liar! Shall we get married? Okay. He used me to cheat on his fiancee. Hey there. Kana, how are you? What is it, Mom? I'm rather busy now. Did you get my letter? Yeah, I think so. It's a photo of a marriage prospect. Matchmaking? You're old enough to marry. And he seems a decent man. Meet him next Sunday. It's an auspicious day. It's at the hotel lounge, near the station. Hey, Kana! It's time for vittles. Yes, darlin'. Just a cotton-picking minute! You frightened me. Don't scream like that. No, never! Not a chance, Mom. I have a boyfriend. We're planning to marry. Really? Then why didn't you say so? When? When will we meet him? Sometime later. Okay, let's do it when your father and I visit. No, don't do that, Mom. I've got it all planned out. We're not allowed to meet him? I didn't say that. Okay, let's speak soon. (Fortune Teller) Welcome. Over there. I've been expecting you. The thing is... I know. Your face tells me everything. You've been dumped. How sad. See? It's written all over your face. He was such a liar. I thought he was my destiny. Mr Right, eh? Is there such a man? Yes, an encounter with destiny awaits you. Attend this party and meet him. A two-day, one-night matchmaking party? Not a chance. I'm a wedding planner. I don't go to matchmaking parties. Cheers! Now's the time for you all to mix. Matsuki, the soccer star? How cool! Can I shake your hand? Thank you. A star soccer player. Very popular with girls. How come you're here? Why? I'm the official organizer. It's your party? You came, after all. Thanks for the invite. I've met so many wonderful men. Let me see. So many. Which one is the man of my destiny? I'd take any of them. They're all my type. You didn't hear the full explanation. There's only one condition for men to attend. They must earn over 10 million a year. That's all. We don't care about private matters. Theoretically, conmen and practiced liars could have snuck in here. Liars, like who? Well, married men. Ex-convicts, or maybe butch lesbians? How terrible! I could never be with a known liar. Well, I'm sorry, but mainly liars will hit on you. Only one man in ten will tell you the truth. And that one fellow is the man of your destiny. Some here are famous. I can't believe it. You're being nasty because I received so many offers. You're far too gullible. Okay, I'll give you a hint. Your favorite soccer player. I suspect he's a liar. Ask yourself if I'm telling the truth, or not. Come on in. This is my room. Sorry we didn't get a chance to talk earlier. That's okay. Just give me a moment, please. I'll go freshen up. He's really good-looking. What? I always score goals. And I'm tired of waiting, for my little kitty-cat. Finally, we meet. Theoretically, conmen and practiced liars could have snuck in here. Liar. There's a woman in this room with you. What are you saying? Explain this opened shower-cap. (Evidence 1) No man ever uses a shower-cap. No, that was my manager. I'm sure I'll find some girl here, pretending to be your manager. I came unexpectedly, she had to hide. How strange to have twin beds, with only one set of toiletries. (Evidence 2) (Evidence 3) No, don't! Give me a moment. Let me kick a goal straight into your heart. Stop hiding, show yourself. You peeping pervert! (Is This Evidence?) Mommy! Your mother? Don't bathe here. I'm so sorry, my precious darling. I know. Let's all take a bath together. It's a short-cut to getting to know each other. - Are you for real? - Great idea! You're brilliant, Mommy. No way! You little mommy's boy! She thinks I'm a mommy's boy? All men are mommy's boys. Then why lie that she's your manager? My only condition for a husband is that he never lies to me. I don't care about your mommy issues, but don't lie to me. What's her problem? Well? Do you believe me now? So it's one of the remaining nine? The man of my destiny? Yes, but only if you can find him. He's my destiny. I must find him. He's a terrible liar. Shall we get married? Cheating on her with me? There's only one man for me. I can't deal with all that misery. Nine men left. Eight of them are liars. But who is he? And who's lying? His name, or his occupation? Character, or personal history? No one can lie convincingly forever. Eventually the lies will get outed. But don't dare lie to me. I'll expose the lies, whatever it takes. Liar. I knew that I'd met you somewhere before. Isn't that right, Mr Morisaki? (Evidence 1) A photo of Yoshioka and Kato's wedding. Now you have a different name. Don't you, Morisaki? I was their wedding-planner. I thought I recognized you. Me, too. But not by your new name. (Evidence 2) I remembered how you folded a napkin. You gave me the exact same napkin at the wedding, remember? (Evidence 3) Why is a married man even at this party? You should talk. You've already been up to that soccer player's room, right? You suck! This is her new costume. But I have no interest in pop stars. Liar. You're known for chasing pop-singers. (Evidence 1) You're perhaps her most famous fan. One day, you'll regret this. I supervised today's desserts. Please. Excuse me. No, wait! It's okay, really. - Shameful! - I'm sorry. You made a fool of me. I'm so sorry, Chef. Stop that. Kana. Look. You can have this back. What on earth for? Don't get me wrong. At work, I'm very strict. But I'm never violent to girlfriends. In fact, I'd do anything for you. Liar. What about Ms Hikaru Kawasaki? She wrote that you beat her. (Evidence 1) She attached a medical report. Fake news. She's a disgruntled ex-employee. She got injured at work. That's all. (Evidence 2) Not according to your social media history. What about it? The birthday on here is her birthday. You and she were lovers. (Evidence 3) But she couldn't take the beatings, so she left you. (Evidence 4) She details every instance of your domestic violence. I should have never posted that cake photo. But you couldn't help it, could you? Because it truly is such a wonderful cake. You get that? You're right. It was the best I've ever made. Isn't that because you made it for the one you love? Finish off the desserts. I'm beat. A fever? Are you okay? Doctor Shiga. No, stay seated. Thank you. Yes, you are feverish. I thought so. These are analgesics. Take them and go to bed. Thank you, Doctor. Get some moisture into the air. You're really kind, Dr Shiga. I'm impressed. Not to everyone, though. We've only just met, so maybe you won't believe me. I've never felt like this before. I want you so badly. Good night. Yes, good night. Good morning. Feeling better? Yes, I'm fine. Thanks for yesterday. What happened yesterday? Did Dr Shiga score? I was ill and he gave me medicine. Are you okay? Don't overdo it. One thing strikes me as very strange. You're a good-looking doctor. How come you're still single? Let me guess. You're divorced? How rude. I'm not a divorcee. Very picky about women? No, just too busy with my career. That's why my ideal wife is domesticated and supportive. Liar. You have been married, haven't you? Why say that? (Evidence Received) A ring mark? But I'm single now. What's a couple of divorces, anyway? A couple of? Don't get trapped in the past. Then why lie in your profile? (Evidence 1) You're the one who's trapped in the past. But I'm serious about dating you. Sorry. No, wait. I can't possibly be with a liar. Thank you. Are you okay? I know how you feel. I had a girlfriend for a whole year. I proposed on our first anniversary. She refused because she had another boyfriend. She broke up with me to marry him. He's been through the same thing as me. That's why I signed up for this matchmaking party. So she lied to you? Yes, but it wasn't all bad. We had fun. Listen, Kana. Can we maybe meet up after this? There she is. Hello. Good morning. Morning. These guys all want to exchange contact details. If you don't mind. You're a very private person. Me, too. If that's okay. I'd be honored. You're very popular. Oh, get real. I want your contact details, too. But I left my phone in my room. So write it down. Your full name, please. So I don't confuse you with any other girls. I've always been secretly in love with you. Thank you. I'll call you. That's how the two-day matchmaking event ended. Mr Mamiya. Mr Katagiri. Mr Kagami. Mr Kurono. What? Only four? Who's the fifth one? I forgot Mr Yuikawa. He's so ordinary, I forgot about him. It's Kagami! Hello, Sakurai speaking. Is he the man of my destiny? (Aquarium) I'm glad I'm a writer. I can date you on weekdays. The other guys are all at work. Do you think that's a bad thing? Not at all. I knew it. I work mainly weekends, so weekdays are better for me, too. Today we'll meet the Octopus Cat Man. Let's all call him together. The Octopus Cat Man show! Can I go watch? What's wrong with you today? He's so cute. He wants to take selfies with you all. That costume is a work of art. Mr Yuikawa? Oh, hi there. How come? I came to catch the Octopus Cat Man show. Do you like the character? Me, too. Well, well. Mr Yuikawa? Hello, Kagami. How are you? What a coincidence. Sorry to disturb you. Excuse me. What a small world! Did a broken heart inspire you to go to the party? Why do you say that? You're attractive, you don't need dating parties. Why not tell me? Maybe I can offer some advice. I won't do it. So you don't trust me? I had a bad experience. But it's all over now. Now I just want to treasure each moment. Excuse me. Yes? There seems to be some kind of system problem. All our data has disappeared. What? Hello. I'm so sorry. Oh, you came! I'm sorry. What happened, Ayumi? Mr Mamiya? You came to our rescue? Well, it is our system. But it's all fixed now. I'm so relieved. I'm sorry. We really appreciate your help. Thank you so much. Not at all. But do you mind if I ask? You look so different today. Were you out on a date? Sorry, I didn't have time to get changed. Do you mind if I ask you to dinner? Mamiya, the hot-shot CEO, is asking me out? Sure. Actually, I have something to ask you about Mr Katagiri. Mr Katagiri, from university? What's your relationship with him? He was my senior at university. That's all? Am I missing something? He approached me about my company making a loan to him. He wants money? Yes, a rather large sum. I was hoping you haven't made loans to him. No, I haven't. And you didn't guarantee any loans? No, I didn't. I see. In that case, I'm relieved. Sorry to bring it up. Not at all. But he was a heavy gambler at college. So you've got me worried. Worried about him? I envy him. I've only ever known you in a work setting. What about at school? What was your relationship then? Relax, Mamiya. Miss Sakurai. To be honest, I'd like us to have a more meaningful relationship. Is he declaring his love for me? Who is Mr Right? Work problem fixed? I enjoyed our date today. No need to reply. From Kagami. Mr Kagami. Hello? Hey there, Kana. It's Kurono here. Hello Kurono. Will you join Yuikawa and me for a drink? From now? Only one man is your destiny. It's up to you to find him. Yes, I will. I'm working on the third book in the series. But I haven't raised the money yet. How come? The series is so popular. Problems with the publisher, so I'm self-publishing the third one. I'm confident it'll be a best seller. The fans want more. That sounds fantastic. I really want to read it now. You think so? Excuse me. I must take this. Look... Have you been well? We met earlier today. Right, we did. Do you go to the aquarium often? No, that was my first time. To see the Octopus Cat Man? That's so cute. It's a limited edition. You can have it. Really? Thank you. Sorry 'bout that. I'll go to the bathroom. Me, too. (Nyataro & the Sea World) So this is it? Written by Shigeyuki Minakawa? His pen name? What are you doing? Nothing. I saw you. Mind your own business. What was that? What's going on? Nothing. - I suggest you check your bag. - What for? Let's go see the city night lights. He was going through your bag. Please check that there's nothing missing. Is that true, Kurono? Not you, too? Trust me. There goes my surprise. It's so cute. Sorry I doubted you. Don't worry about it. Look, I'm truly sorry about that. That's okay. As long as you understand. I'm fine with it He's so open and honest. He's no liar. An invoice for what? Three million yen? What's this for? Mamiya Finance Co., Ltd.? Hello, Miss Sakurai? Sorry Mr Mamiya, we need to talk. Something wrong? I received a strange invoice from Mamiya Finance. We discussed Katagiri, remember? Is that somehow connected? Let's meet and talk about it over lunch. Sure. Hello, Ms Sakurai? Can you hear me? Hello? I have to get help. I know. Hello, my princess. Don't be so scared. Even if you dress me like her, I'm not your idol. If you hadn't rejected me the way you did, there would've been no need for me to do this. This is my character's latest costume. One day, you'll regret this. I forgot your ribbon. Now you're perfect. Who the hell is that? - Excuse me. - What is it? You're that designer. Somebody, help me! Out of my way. Sakurai! Help me! - Sakurai! - Yuikawa! Are you okay? Look out! Yuikawa! Yuikawa! Yuikawa! Are you okay? You came to rescue me? Yes, I checked your social media page. Why are you dressed like that? He's that famous fashion designer. But he's a real Otaku. He kidnapped me because I resemble his favorite pop singer. If I don't wear this, I can't go home. All I wanted was for her to wear my all-time favorite costume. So you kidnapped her? She's mine. Only mine! She's not your pop star. And you're not a real fan, anyway. Shut up! Yuikawa! You belong to me. (Pop-star's manager) Wait for just a minute, dear. What's so funny? I'm just glad that costume isn't to your taste, Sakurai. Why did you call me Sakurai? You attended the Nakazaki Primary School. Your name is Kana Sakurai. Who are you? Do you smell something burning? Are you okay? Sakurai. Get up, we must escape. What's going on? Sakurai, wait here. Help! Somebody help! Hey! Are you okay? Sakurai... She's inside. Yes my dear, you're all mine. You're mine, all mine. I adore you. Hold on there, Sakurai. Mr Mamiya. You're safe now. No significant injuries? I'm fine. And you? I'm good. Right, I'll call you later for your statement. You're safe now. Mr Kagami. Are you okay? Thanks for responding to my SOS. I'll drive you home. Mr Mamiya, we need to talk. Let's give them some space. Is Mamiya Finance affiliated with your firm? (Evidence 1) That's right. After the party, he put in for a 3 million yen loan. With you as his guarantor. I suspected he'd tricked you into writing your name. But I hesitated to ask you directly. I would've had to reveal my true identity. What is your true identity? Something to do with that tattoo on your back? (Evidence 2) Yes, you're right. I'm heir to the Mamiya Crime Syndicate. I'll assume the role passed down through six generations of my family. And I want you to be by my side. Our public-face business has been successful. We won't live off dirty money. You'll be happy. That's impossible. Yakuza gangsters prey on people. I can't marry a gangster. So you're just another regular woman? I liked you because of your strong-will. But you're just bait for a handsome face. You only see the surface of things. I thought you were different from other girls. Don't push your ideals onto me. It's you who only see the surface. You doubt yourself, that's why you lied. If you become the gang-boss, reveal your true self. I said that out loud. Forgive me. No, look... I'll never bother you again, Miss Sakurai. I'll delete your name from the loan contract. Mr Mamiya. Is that you, Katagiri? You used my name to get a fraudulent loan. Write your full name. (Evidence 1) I'm sorry. But you and I... Liar. I'm not your guarantor, and I'm not your date. Are you okay? You knew me, right, Yuikawa? Yes, I did. Why didn't you say so? I didn't realize until after the party. So you two know each other? Yes, classmates from primary school. Two coincidences in a row? Maybe you're meant for each other. No, it's not that. Okay, I'd better get going. Yuikawa. Thanks for everything today. You're not being honest with yourself. Let's go get a drink. It's been a tough day today. Did I make a mistake? Someone said I'd meet Mr Right at that party. But I just can't abide a man who lies. So I still haven't met the man of my destiny. I'd like to tell you it's me you're looking for. You were at the party for work, right? I'm not sure... Sorry, but I have work to do. You can stay, enjoy yourself. (Evidence 1) No, wait. These are track marks, right? Are you ill? Or... Are you a junkie? Writing's tough, but don't turn to drugs. Don't betray your readers. They love your work. It's a legitimate medicine, prescribed by my doctor. I'm so sorry, really. Don't worry. I haven't laughed like that for ages. So you really must be very ill? I won't lie to you anymore. This is the truth. Take a seat. As you suggested, I went to the party in search of interesting stories. I thought so. But I was attracted to you. That part's true. I couldn't take my eyes off you. But I don't want love, or marriage. I have a heart condition. That's my medicine for it. Heart trouble? Yes, it's incurable. I'm stuck with it for life. That's why I don't want to marry. Mr Kagami... I'll stop chasing you. Liar! You're really looking for someone to support you. For now, forgive me. Sorry, I lied to you. I'm glad I met you. I hope you find happiness. So only Kurono and Yuikawa are left. Which one is Mr Right? Why hasn't Kurono called me? Hello? Hello, it's Sakurai. Don't tell me you haven't found him yet? Is there really a man I'm destined to meet? You sound quite down. Naturally! I almost died yesterday. But you're still alive. So who is Mr Right? You must answer that question yourself. Goodbye. I have a hot date waiting. Hello? But don't just sit and wait, go out and find him. What? Bye. What's that mean? Kana? Are you okay? Oh, Mr Kurono. I'm fine now. Good, I'm relieved. Yuikawa called and I wanted to rush to your side. But something came up. I'm sorry. No, that's okay. But now I really do want to see you. Good. Me, too. Yuikawa, what are you doing here? We need to talk. No, how did you know where I live? I worked it out from a photo on your social media. I've been in love with you for a long time. What's a long time? Long before the party. Since we were in primary school. Some classmates used to call me the white pig. The white pig? Hey, White Pig! Stop bullying him! I'll report you to the teacher. It's Sakurai. Quick, run. Aren't you angry? If you are, start working out, and prove them wrong. I remember that. But you've changed so much. When I was at my lowest, you gave me encouragement. Since then, I've always loved you. I changed myself to be your ideal man. Your words helped me become a new person. I had no idea how to get through to you. Then I heard you'd attend that matchmaking party. But how? Your co-worker's social media often features you. Wait. So all these years you've been monitoring me, like a stalker? I never thought I was being weird. That's weird in itself. That's creepy. Weird? Creepy? All those non-coincidences. You lied to me. But at least now I know. You're the last liar. Why does everyone lie to me? If you must lie, stay consistent. I want to trust you. I'm sorry. Thanks for saving me yesterday. But I can't be with a man who lies to me. Goodbye. Hey, Kurono. Hi, Kana. Shall we go? It's a story about a boy. He's an adult now? It starts on the streets of downtown Tokyo. No way! It'll become a film, too. Let's have a steamed meat bun. Yes, the extra-large size. Me wear this? I like the black one. A Chinese fortune teller predicted it. You have so many marriage lines. That was fun. It sure was. My first time in Chinatown. Really? I haven't been for ages. I ate too much. But it was really delicious. You paid for everything? Yes, my new book is finally being published. Really? Congratulations. Thank you, Kana. I want to start dating you, with a view to marriage. Shall we get married? Liar! I already have a boyfriend, Mom. Your father and I want to meet him. Slow down, Mom. You will meet the man of your destiny. Only one man in ten will tell you the truth. And that one fellow is the man of your destiny. He's my destiny. I must find him. Is Kurono really the man I'm supposed to be with? Take a shower first? What? Where is he? Taking a phone call? I know. I'll buy his new book. It won't go through? Yes, I can't seem to use my credit card. I'm afraid your card has been maxxed out. You've exceeded your cash withdrawal limit. They're gone. All my credit cards. Kurono! It's the police. What's going on? What's happening? - Is he here? - No, sir. We'll need you at the police station. Kurono is wanted for serial marriage fraud. Marriage fraud? Yes. Kurono is just one of many names he uses. Over 10 victims have filed claims. For a total of 30 million yen. Please confirm this is the man. Well? Yes, it's him. No mistake. She identified him. It's Kurono. Liar. Yes, it's definitely him. We arrested Kurono. Really? Two men were arguing. An officer questioned them. One was identified as Kurono. - What's going on? - Nothing. He was going through your bag. Please check that there's nothing missing. Was the man he was arguing with called Yuikawa? He left without giving his name. Thanks for picking me up. I organized the matchmaking party. I feel responsible that a fraudster managed to sneak in. Creeps like that belong in jail. All men are frauds, anyway. Not one of them ever told me the truth. Mr Right? The man of my dreams? Every single one was a liar. You're right. But were they all bad lies? When you love someone, you try to look good. Sometimes you lie. Is that such a bad thing? Isn't putting on make-up and getting dressed up, a form of lying? Me, I don't wear make-up. Just liner on my eyebrows. Sometimes people lie to protect others. Are you okay by yourself? You can have it. Really? Thank you. Please check that there's nothing missing. - Sakurai! - Yuikawa! Are you okay? It's Yuikawa. He tried so hard to save me. Were all his lies bad lies? Your words helped me become a new person. I've loved you since primary school. Hello, Mom? Hello Kana. Mommy. When's a good time to finally meet him? I'm sorry, Mom. I lied to you. But no more lies. I never had any plans to marry. I don't even have a boyfriend. No. I really did meet Mr Right. But I just didn't realize it. Poor Kana. I'm sorry, Mom. That's okay, dear. Come back home, Kana. Mom. We're always here for you, darling. Thank you. (Matchmaking photo from Mom) You liar. Based on the dating game app Liar! Uncover the Truth by Voltage Inc.
