Do you have a girlfriend? - No, not yet. - Yes, I do. - No. - Oh, not yet. - No. - That's personal. - But that would be nice. - I already have a wife. Well... Single! What's your type? - My type? - European. - C-cup. - Mixed. - Prim and proper. - Chompoo Araya. Players are exciting. - Never gave it any thought. - Slanted eyes are a turnoff. You should be asking who finds me attractive? In our department, if you could choose anybody, who would you choose? If I had to choose someone here? Do you ask everyone this question? I'd rather be alone. May I go now? Is it true? Yes. Sure, Thip. You can't be that naive. If they're not together, why did they drink from the same straw? If they act like this, that means they did it already. Seriously, inside the coffee shop, I saw him touching her ass. Everyone, please come to the meeting room. Before you started working here, everyone had signed an employment contract with a non-fraternization clause. According to statistics in Japan, 100 percent of couples who work together-- Stupid rule. If they want to be together, why do you stop them? Right! How idiotic! ...and another 46.7 percent will conspire to commit crimes. Now, in our department someone is breaking this rule. Ms. Ning. Shit. You? Mr. Ake. Please follow me to my room. Damn. What the heck is wrong with you? Every day, I tell Ake to check out Ning's boobs. I told him to look just now. Stay away from me. I am not that close to you. That photo was taken on Orientation Day. Well, Ning and I have been close ever since university. - Exactly. - Right? - Very close. - Yes, very close. - Like brother and sister. - Like brother and sister. Are you guys this close? This is the after-party. - Lots of people play with water. - Yes, yes. Fun. - Just drunk. - Totally drunk. What about this? It is just a game. - Yes. - That is also a game. - Yes, that is a game too. - What kind of game? Pass the watermelon game. Yes. Just passing it along in turn. Yes, lots of people played that. That is a watermelon, not a tongue. If that is a watermelon, this must be a hotdog. Who posted this photo! I don't know. Ms. Jib, it is not what it looks like. Fine. Then, you and Ake need to decide who is giving the handjob. You mean "giving up the job"? - I can't take it anymore! - What? I can't stay this way and fire people. If anyone finds out about us, what am I going to do? Jib, don't be paranoid. - No one will know about us. - Is anyone following us? - No. - I told you to check. Check! I did! Okay then. What if we bring fake dates to work for appearance's sake? - Wait. A fake partner? - Yes. A fake one. Whoever, just hire one. A maid or someone. Gosh. Jib! Don't try to argue with me. - Let's hire one tomorrow. - Jib, stop it! No need to know what we are There is no need for words This is the pressure I have to confront I have given all my heart to you Here it comes. It's your fault. You hit on me first. You made the first move. Move? When did I do that? Well, miss... We're here. Just call me Jib. We are the same age. Fine. I admit it. But you flirted with me too. DON'T BE SURPRISED. I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU... What is this? It's a special document... for your urgent consideration. DON'T BE SURPRISED. I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU... THIS GIRL IS SO CUTE. YOU'RE LATE. DON'T THINK I WON'T DEDUCT YOUR PAY. YOU CAN TAKE MY MONEY, BUT DON'T BREAK MY HEART. Let's break up. What? What's wrong with you? That's not a solution! Are we a couple or just lovers? Why do we have to hide like this? It's very frustrating. Then, let's get married. So, it will be on Oct 31st. On Halloween. Please make a deposit of 150,000 baht within two weeks. Congratulations. Are you smiling now? Right? What? Do you feel better now? So, you've already proposed. Don't get cold feet later! Have I ever chickened out yet? Hello, Ms. Jib. Stop messing around here. Yesterday, when I proposed to you, I was just kidding. - You looked stressed, that's why. - No way. I'm already 27. I won't ever let you go. Gosh. Feisty. Really feisty. I've told my family. My parents are very happy. They said you will have to resign then. So you can help at the factory. Wait. I didn't say I would resign. You first. You proposed first. Yes, I did. Yes. I did propose, but I didn't say that I'd quit. Jib, you should resign. I will take care of you. And why can't I be the one who takes care of you? What kind of a man would allow that? Allow what? Nowadays, it's normal. It's normal if you are a pimp. But I earn more money than you do. You quit! You quit, Jib! - Hello. - Hello. Ms. Jib, this is my son. Just got his masters from Cornell. He'll have his training here. Hello. My name is Yeoh. If you ask me how I feel to be here, I would like to tell you all that I am very excited. And if you wonder how I feel-- Nobody asked. No shit. His parents must have dropped him when he was little. Sure. And his face hit the ground first. I... feel a bit pressured. But if you ask if I am scared, I am not. Because I am sure that I am joining the team made up of professionals. Thank you very much. So everyone, please, no need for unnecessary reticence. Please teach him anything you want. YOU KNOW I CAN JUST FIRE YOU. Don't be intimidated. Think of him as an ordinary trainee who must start his work on time. IF YOU FIRE ME, I'LL TELL YOUR BOSS. No privileges. And if he ever crosses the line, just let me know. Well, Dad? About the bank's no fraternizing rule... It doesn't apply to trainees, right? No, no. That's a relief. That means I can hit on... Ms. Jib. You are joking, right? This is not a joke. This is for real. Ms. Jib. Ms. Jib. Yes? How is the new software system? We have already started implementing it at Chonburi. The stadium is fully packed with Buriram fans, but they can't drown out the cheers of Chonburi fans. Piphop kicks the ball to the left of Therdsak. Nattapong passes it on to Arthit. - Hey, hurry up! - That was so close! Chonburi is taking the lead right now. Hey! What? Why is it in Japanese? Let me see. How to change it to Thai? How am I supposed to know? It's all in Japanese. You're right. Damn it! Is it this one maybe? Look. They are both in the same spot. Are you sure? Buriram has control of the ball! It's one-on-one. Oh, my! Saved by Sintawee! That was close! Your call. I'm sure it's the one. SYSTEM UPDATE Chonburi! Chonburi! Buriram! The referee adds three minutes of extra time for the first half. WITHDRAWAL AMOUNT One. Two. Three. Four. BALANCE AMOUNT - 17,500.00 AVAILABLE BALANCE - 17,500.00 WITHDRAWAL AMOUNT Yes! What's up, Pued? Hello, Paed! Come to the ATM right now. It's giving out free money. What? I can't hear you. I said the ATM is paying out double. What? Free what? The ATM is giving out double your money! What double Ds? The ATM is giving out double your money! The one in front of Thai Life Insurance. Okay. I'll see you later. Why are you speaking in a Northern dialect? No! I said, the ATM is giving out double your money! What? The ATM is giving out free money! Holy shit! How could an ATM give away an extra 130,000 baht? Our IT guys checked the hard disk and detected an error in the updated software. Have you checked the CCTV? What's wrong with the footage? Why did you allow someone to randomly stick a pest control ads there? I called them to complain already. High-angle CCTV! We've got one, haven't we? What's this? The technicians who installed the machine. They've been trying to resolve the situation. But... Pull the plug! Pull the plug! The technicians said the people who took the money must have been there during the half-time. What time was the break? Cross-check the timestamps from the ATM and you'll have all the names. As I said, there was a glitch in the software. None of the names on that list has a timestamp attached. Which means there's no way to track down who made withdrawals and got the extra money? From the information we have on hand, I would say we have nothing. How long have you worked here? Almost ten years. Before the board meeting next Friday, I need to know who made those withdrawals and you need to get all the money back. If you can't do that, I will revoke ten years' worth of your bonus! Well... Both of you! But it is only 130,000 baht. It can't compare to ten years' worth of our bonus. This isn't about money. It's about the trust in our bank. Ms. Jib. Ms. Jib Is your heart still available? My heart is available With enough room to keep you in there Do you want to change your last name Do you want to change Your last name to mine? It's your chance to try it out The only fear I have is you will love it Loving my last name THIS IS NOT AN EMPTY THREAT. TOMORROW WON'T JUST BE FLOWERS. QUIT! If I were Jib and had a guy sings for me like that, I would jump out of the window. Jib is starting to fall for him. I heard that they are going out of town together. - What? - Yes. Out of town. Plus, it's an overnight stay. I bet this time, Yeoh and Jib will get it on for sure. Come on! I am so jealous of Yeoh. Look carefully, Jib's boobs are big too. They bounce when she walks. I'm getting goosebumps! What the hell, man? I am sorry. I flicked my wrist too hard on that one. Is it red? It's hardly noticeable. Why did you put a spin on it? My eye is going to fall out. I'm not playing anymore. - Fine! You can have the score. - You keep it! So... Just the two of you going out of town... People will think you are easy. Well... Why would anyone think that? We are going there to work. - Then, go with me. - I can't. People will be suspicious. Then, tell me what you are working on. I will do it. It's out of your league. Really? Are they sending you to stop the flood? No. An ATM in Chonburi erroneously cashed out 130,000. The bank wants to know who has the money and ask me to take it back. Is that it? Piece of cake. It isn't that simple. If you succeed, I will resign. Okay. You said it. If I can do it, you will quit. What if you can't? Then, I will quit. Look. I will keep in mind what you just said. I am glad that my girlfriend doesn't have Alzheimer's. AUMMARA TO LOVE, WE MUST TAKE A RISK. 1 p.m., IN FRONT OF YOUR HOUSE. What's in your hand? A gum. Let me see. Why did you swallow your gum? Are you going to meet that loser again? Listen, Gob. You can talk to me about anything. - I will always-- - I am sorry, Mom. Gob! I am your mother! You brat! Bastard! Damn you! JNBC BANK, CHONBURI BRANCH Ms. Jib has seen these pictures, correct? Yes. Here is the list of clients who made withdrawals that day. All of this? Yes. And Ms. Jib has already seen this list? Correct. THAI LIFE INSURANCE Are you living your life? TEMPORARILY OUT OF SERVICE 825 people. I have seven days. Interview 100 people a day. That should be okay. It's possible. It's possible. Shit! Hell, no! Hole in one! How could it have fallen into that tiny hole? Shit! Shit! Actually, you don't have to walk me out. No, I have to because it's dark and dangerous around here. You'll never know if there's a psycho lurking around. How are things going? No progress yet. Could you please check on Mr. Sua as well? Why do we have to do that? I am evaluating his work and I don't want him to know. Oh, I see. Right. You are really hard working. Well, Ms. Jib... If I want to talk to you about something, you wouldn't... feel uncomfortable, would you? Well... You are a great employee. You're soft-spoken and responsible. Let me be direct. You are my type. Just a second. Hello. What's up, bitch? Last night, I was so smashed. I was holding the toilet lid while puking. Damn right, and? Yes, bitch. I don't even want to brag. Hold on. Thanks for sending me off. Shit. It was like... Damn it! I smell like puke. Bitch. And the cigarettes you bought yesterday... Just talking about it makes my throat itchy. Are there any locksmiths in the area? Hop in. I will take you. Are you from around here? Bangkok. Yes? Hello. What can I do for you, Mr. Sua? Can you schedule appointments with the people on the list for tomorrow? - Sure. - Schedule as many as you can. Mr. Sua, what are the appointments for? I think the people who took the unauthorized money are on this list. Oh, I see. Okay. Okay. Okay. Thank you. And why are you here? Taking care of some business. Do you work at the bank? Are you sure there's a locksmith around here? Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! What's wrong with the car? Still got gas too. Oh, my god! What? Please, sir. Could you help push the car for me? This is totally not my day. Holy shit! Hey! Where are you going? Come back! Have you forgotten... about me here? What the hell? Shit! Shit! No wonder it's locked tightly. Hey! What are you doing here? Please don't shoot. Don't shoot. Hey! Hey! Gob. Pued. Pued. Come here! One second. Gob. Please take good care of my heart. Of course. I only have one and I don't easily give it out. Got it. I... only give it to the person I truly love. Love you. Pued! Enough already. Look at her. She looks like she really needs to take a dump. So cute. Cut it out. We have to go now. Hurry. What are we going to do? I already used the money to buy my bike. You're lucky. Look at me. They have to rip out my tooth. What am I going to do? What if we set him on fire? But there will be smoke. Shall we drown him? His body will float. Think, jackass! Shall we feed him to sharks? Not even a bone left. Not a bone left. How much money do we get in total? For the two of us, around 30,000 baht or so. 30,000 baht or so... And you want to kill someone for that? So, what should we do? I don't know, man. All I know is I am heated up. Open the window. Thank you. Sorry. Are all the interviewees here? Hey, you? - Ms. Jib! - Yes? - What are you doing here? - To see you, Mr. Sua. Manager, Ms. Jib just arrived. She must be tired. Maybe a coffee will help. Could you please get her one? Sure. It's good you're here. So you can see how a professional gets the work done. Yes! So, Mr. Professional, - why is no one here yet? - Soon. - Really? - Yes. Mr. Professional, do you want some noodles? The noodles are getting stale. I have to go. Watching a professional like you has tired me out. I do sympathize. Hundreds of people made the withdrawals. How are you going to find out who took the money? What if a person made more than one withdrawal? You have my support. Don't give up. That's him! Pued. My finger is stuck. Let me help. You call that "help"? - My finger is going to tear off. - I am sorry. Pued, can you see if he's gone yet? He is crossing the street. That's okay. Pued, just get out of here. Don't worry about me. - Okay. - Damn, Pued! I was just testing you. You are my true friend. Hey, you. Why did you abandon me yesterday? I abandoned you? You're the one who left! I went to use the toilet. You disappeared. I drove around all night looking for you. Paed, he's the guy you said is here to get the money back? That's the guy who took the unauthorized money. - I don't think so. - It's him! Your relative died a month ago. The ATM incident took place this week. He can't be the one. What are you doing here? Are you guys related to him? - Yes. - That's good. He's been haunting the temple staff every night. Very scary. You should call out his spirit and guide him home. Give him directions in detail. From the temple's entrance, turn left. Cross the overhead bridge. At the intersection, turn right. When you spot a 7-11 shop, turn towards the alley until you get to house number 114. Isn't that my house? Yes, it is. Gosh! MRS. AUMMARA PORNSUCHART MRS. AUMMARA PORNSUCHART MRS. AUMMARA PORNSUCHART Hello, Manager. I need you to do me a favor. Yes, Ms. Jib. What can I do for you? But you cannot tell Mr. Sua. Hey. Stop! Stop here. It's gone! My car was parked right here. My car's gone! Where did my car go? I'm not lying, seriously. I dropped the key in the gutter. I didn't say you were lying. But you can't just go around picking car locks. What if you bring me your car registration for verification? Then, you can take your car. Do you - sell guns? - Sure. What kind do you need? Premium or standard issue. - Premium. - Short or long? - Short is fine. - Gas or air? Air. - Roll or magazine? - Magazine. - Dull black or glossy? - Dull black. - Just a second. - Okay. All is out. - What do you have? - Nothing. You punk! What's with the questions then? You're wasting my time. I have handcuffs. - Do you want it? - I'll take it. Metal or... Metal or whatever, just get it! Put them all on the counter and I will pick. Some water too. Water or... Just bring whatever is in your fridge! Chrysanthemum water and such. - What if there is none? - Just bring whatever. Gosh! AUMMARA PORNSUCHART Hello, this is Tharachonburi Hotel. Connect me to the fax, please. Okay. Hey? You're under arrest. Arrest? Where did you get that uniform? - It's time to go on a stakeout. - What? Let's go catch some criminals. MS. JIB - HEAD OFFICE Did you send me the fax? About to. I didn't get it yet. Did you forget? No, I didn't. I'm sorry, Mr. Sua. My wife needs me to run some errands. That's fine. I can handle it myself. FAX SERVICE Excuse me. Can I use your fax machine? Go ahead, officer. Thank you. Hi! Did you receive my fax just now? Are you referring to the one addressed to Ms. Jib, room 8005, right? Room 8005, what hotel again? Here's some water. It's Tharachonburi Hotel. Can you check whether the entire fax went through? Because when I sent it, there was an error. Please wait. Okay. One moment. Yes, it looks fine. Can you read it for me just in case? What does it say? There is no message. Just a copy of an ID Card. A copy of an ID card? Whose ID card? Aren't you the one who sent it? You should know. Oh, yes. Sorry. I forgot. Thank you very much. Sir, what kind of ice is this? Not cold at all. - My dentures. - What? THARACHONBURI HOTEL Hello. There is a fax for you at the front desk. Okay. - Hey, you! - Hey! Move over. - Are you a cop? - Yes. Let's go to Tharachonburi Hotel now. Yes, sir. Hey, follow that car! Hurry! Hurry up! Okay. AUMMARA LAUNDRY SERVICE Sir, why is the woman going into Mrs. Aum's shop? She is probably trying to reclaim the bank's money too. Aren't you guys on the same team? Yes, we are. Ms. Aummara, right? Yes, I am Mrs. Aummara. Are you sending your laundry? No. I am from JNBC bank. What can I do for you? You had withdrawn money from an ATM that paid out double, right? No. I don't know what you are talking about. Really? I think you do. Your withdrawals are very unusual. What do you mean by unusual? Did I use my elbows to withdraw? No. It's unusual because on Oct 2nd, you made six consecutive withdrawals. For the first time, it's 1,000 baht. The second time, it's 1,000 baht. And for the third, fourth and fifth time, it's 20,000 baht each. The last one was 16,000 baht. So, the total is 78,000 baht. Normally, to withdraw 78,000 baht, one would withdraw 20,000 baht thrice, and another 18,000 baht. Don't you think so? So what? I'm free to withdraw money any way I like, right? I'm entitled to a financial freedom. I didn't say you can't. But it seems like after you discovered that the ATM dispensed you extra cash, you made another five withdrawals. You took the unauthorized money, didn't you? Are those brand-new washing machines? Please have the money ready by tomorrow. I will come by to get the money. What are we going to do next? Follow her. - I need a room. - What type? I want room 8004. If you keep acting like this, I won't click "like" for you. - Hey. - Mimi, please. Let's both take one step back. Each takes one step back. Take one step back. Step back? Nonsense! No way. Hello. - Are you home yet? - Just got home a while ago. I drove and I didn't walk. What's up? Are you free tomorrow? Can you go and see my mom? She needs help with the buffet head count. Tomorrow? I can't, very busy. Never mind. I will handle it. About quitting... Prepare yourself. I'm going to win. Look, the moon is smiling at us now. What does the moon have to do with anything? You're talking nonsense. What are you up to? What if I had a heart attack? If you're serious about our competition, you could have at least changed your car. If you're going to cheat, don't get caught like this. Shameful! Look at you, impersonating a police officer. You look more like a postman! It's working so far. You better get ready to resign. The laundry lady already returned all the money to me. Where's the money? Show me. In the bank. After three years together, I know that when you lie, your nostrils twitch just like that! See! - You cross-eyed woman! - What? You furry-brows! Where are you going? Just insult and run away, are we? - Come back then, you wuss! - You cross-eyed woman! - Sissy! - Wait. Who are you talking to? I can't tell from your eyes. Hey, wait. Wait. Tissue roll? Don't throw. It'll hurt. PREPARE FOR DEFEAT. HERE'S THE FACE OF THE ONE RESIGNING. JIB, BETTER USE YOUR TIME TO GET READY TO BE MY HOUSEWIFE - SUA. Excuse me, is Mrs. Aummara here? Hey, is Mrs. Aummara here? Mom just went out. Where did she go? You won't know the place. Let me take you there. Okay. Let me ride it. You mean the bike, right? Of course! No, you might pull a stunt by braking hard. It's better if I ride it. Are you leaving me? - Mom. - What? Someone is here for you. Yes, officer? He said that you withdrew some unauthorized money from the ATM and he wanted to see you. So, I brought him here. What money? I don't know what you're talking about. I didn't take it. See? My mom didn't take it. The other day, a customer forgot and left 20 baht in his pocket. But Mom returned it. My darling. I will always return it even as little as two or three baht. If you don't believe her, make her swear to the Buddha. Ma'am! Ma'am! Ma'am! Shit! Tour de France much? Thank you. Thank you. Excuse me, how much does it take to Mrs. Aummara's Laundry Service? I have to refuse. It is not my route. Try another minibus. Hey, hold this. - What's in there? - Frogs. No! Am I at a hospital? No, you're at a bank. What? Bank? Bank? Bank? I didn't take the money. I don't know anything. I didn't take any unauthorized money. Wow! So handsome. Please keep an eye on your mom. Don't let her give the money to the bank lady. - Got it? - No problem. I will take care of it. What have I gotten myself into? Snap away, please. 1, 2, 3! A great match, right? So cute. Look at this. So sweet. - What song was that? - The wedding march played in a church. No, it's an advertising theme song for Five-Star Chicken! Is that so? Gob. Gob, what are you doing here with him? Nothing. We ran into each other by accident. What's in your hand? How could you have taken wedding photos with him? What about me? Me? Me? Are you two dating? - Yes. - No. - Just friends. - Friends? In the past, I admit I had feelings for you. But now, I realize he is... the one. It's not what it looks like. There is nothing going on between us. If it makes you happy, I will go. After all, it is my fault. My heart fell for you too quickly. Hey, you. Don't you think your boyfriend deserves an explanation? Thank you for your understanding. Damn. No one listens to me! Wait. Where are you going? Your damn motorcycle is over there. You said "damn" to me. If I don't have a partner to ride with, that motorcycle is useless. He's rich, right? His heart is broken, and he's throwing away his bike. He's not rich. He said he won the bike recently. SEE YOU AT THE FOOTBALL FIELD. REGRETFULLY YOURS, GOB. Hello, Mr. Sua. There is a package from the head office for you. It must be my car key and registration document. Go ahead and open the package. If it is, could you get the car from the police station for me? - Okay. - Thank you. Are you ready to go? Are you in a hurry, Ms. Jib? Mr. Sua asked me to get his car for him. Good. We'll retrieve his car first and help him catch some thieves. Let's go. What did you expect from just a close friend? It's been three months, but you haven't proposed to me? What? What the heck? I am poor. Where would I get the money? What about when you said you won that money? Instead of proposing to me, you used the money to buy the bike, didn't you? Yes. About the ATM giving out extra money, you took some too, right? Yes. Can I go back to being your girl who rides your bike? Hey! Gob, what are you doing? You confessed, Pued. You took the extra money from the ATM, right? Your choice. Return the money or spend the nights in jail? I don't know anything. Shit! You won't talk? Manager, do it. Are you going to talk? Manager, put it inside his shirt. No! Stop it. I'll talk. You won't talk, right? Send someone over. I am at the football field. 18,000 baht! I withdrew 14,000 baht, but the money that came out was double. Oh, no. It's itchy. Together with Pued. We both got double the money. Pued. Paed too? Okay. Aummara. 78,000 baht. Ekalak Sae-Zium. 18,000 baht. Jarun Foochalerm. 14,000 baht. 78,000 baht. Plus 18,000 baht. Plus 14,000 baht. 110,000 baht. Three people add up to 110,000 baht. We're missing another 20,000 baht? Pakorn... Kulareeboriboon. Why does the name sound familiar? Ms. Jib, Ms. Jib! Ms. Jib, Ms. Jib! Stop! Stop! Hey, what's going on? Don't play dumb. PAKORN KULAREEBORIBOON Pakorn sounds familiar. Manager. Confess or the money you took will go to your knee surgery! I confess. I confess. I withdrew some money after the technicians unplugged the ATM. It's on! I was the one who plugged it back in. I tried withdrawing some money just to test if there was still a glitch. Hey! Ms. Jib! Ms. Jib, stop it! I needed the cash, so I made a withdrawal. But the ATM had already been reset by then, so I didn't get any extra money, not even one baht. Evil! Sgt. Aumnuay Chartchua. 20,000 baht. Okay, then. I'll believe you for now. Give me the key to the bank. What do you need the key for? Hello, Mr. Sua? Manager. Your wife and kid are with me. What's going on? If you want both of them safe, you must confess and return the money to the bank. Understand? What do you want me to confess? I didn't take any money. Why don't you ask Ms. Jib? Let me talk to her then. She isn't here anymore. She's heading to the bank. - To the bank? - Yes. It's you. What is this? This? What happened to your arms? M&M? You've gone too far. This hurts. What about you trying to scare me? Wasn't that too much too? What are you doing here? Why do I have to tell you? What about you? Jib, are you okay? I am sorry. Gosh. You snake! Stay still. Don't move or I will shoot at your eyes! Go ahead. I dare you. Do you want a blind husband? Jib! Jib! MANAGER SORRY, MR. SUA. MY KID HAS DIARRHEA. I CAN'T SIGN YOU IN FOR TONIGHT. I'VE ALREADY TOLD MS. JIB I WILL COME IN TOMORROW. What? Can I take a shower here? Who says I need a shower? Tonight is the night. Sgt. Aumnuay's ID card is mine. Can I take a shower here? The hot water is broken in my room. You can sleep here tonight. I'm scared of ghosts. Who says I'm scared of ghosts? Does he like dressing up as an officer? I'll teach him. You've gone too far! Sgt. Aumnuay's ID card is mine. You can sleep here tonight. I'm scared of ghosts. Hey, Jib. - What? - The shop sent the wedding card's sample. You can submit the print order. I am okay with it. Your soy milk is over there. Help me. I can't finish it. You drink it. I already had mine. Why are you acting shady? Are you nuts? It's just soy milk. Don't be paranoid. Is it spiked? Spiked? With sleeping pills? You're imagining things. It's been a tiring day. And it's late now. It's just 8 p.m. You jerk! Let's find something fun to do. Something fun like this? Sua! Bring it on! Manager, may I use your computer? SEARCHING FOR SGT. AUMNUAY Holy shit! Hello. Kid, do you have guns in stock? Yes. What kind? Authentic-looking ones. Give me two. Black Forest or White Gateau? I'm purchasing guns, not cake. Don't be an ass, or I will smack you. Put down your weapons. They're fake. Look, I've dropped them. Fake guns. Don't shoot! I am sorry. Don't shoot. Hello, Jib? Did you manage to get out? Please help bail me out. I got arrested. Oh, poor you. You got arrested? What? You called the cops on me? I thought you liked being tied up. So, I arranged it for you. You always go too far. I was just messing around. You put me in jail for real. This will be on my record. Jib! Please help bailing me out. Jib? Jib, are you listening? Hello, Jib? What's wrong with the computer? I don't know either. The usual password doesn't work. - Did Mr. Sua ask to use your computer? - Yes, he did. He used it this morning. In exchange for the bail. No way! Tiger. No. Try "Suriya". Suriya. S, U, R, I, Y, A. It doesn't work either. Suankularb. 17 May 1983. Noodles. No, it's not. Liverpool. Liverpool fan? Chompoo. Chompoo Araya. That didn't work. Do you want to try another celebrity? A Hollywood celebrity? - Jennifer... - Aniston? Kim. Staring at the sky in the evening - Type! - Type. No. Jennifer Kim doesn't work. U, S, N, A, K, E. U snake. U snake! U snake! Yes, it works! U snake. Jib, U snake! Sorry. I don't need you anymore. Your password couldn't stop a snake like me either. I am on my way to the last suspect's house. Hey, don't go there! That house has a crocodile! Crocodile! Unbelievable! I wasn't born yesterday. Jib, I am serious. It's very dangerous. Jib, forget about the money. Hello, Jib? Jib? What's going on? My girlfriend is going to get the money from a guy who owns a crocodile. What? My ex-husband took the money too? What? He's your ex-husband? Hey, Pued. Are you sure you want to help him out? He stole your girlfriend! If his girlfriend dies, he'll be single though. You didn't tell me you have someone. I'm so hurt. Scandalous. Hello! Hello, Jib? Help. Jib, what's the matter? Jib! - I... - Hello, Jib. I've arrived. Don't even bother coming. Just take a ride back to Bangkok and resign. Hey, Jib. Don't go inside! It is very dangerous. Hello, Jib? Hey, Paed, go faster. My girlfriend is already there. Okay. Jib. Jib, are you okay? - Are you hurt? - I am okay. What the hell? Hey, don't shoot! Jack. Jack. Jack, my son. Jack. Are you okay, Jack? I am sorry. I didn't mean to. I will take you to the doctor. What are you looking at? Help me! Excuse me! Excuse me! Please! Hey, what the hell is that? Please get out of the way. What's this? Could you please... Be careful. Hey, are you crazy or what? Did you really intend to shoot the kids? I only wanted to scare them. I didn't mean to fire. But the gun went off by accident. Doctor, how is my kid, Jack? Jack. My darling. Look at your dad. When you were little and hit your head, your dad told me to stitch it up myself. He didn't even take you to the hospital. No wonder I have issues. I need love from men. Doctor. Doctor. Is my son okay? I am so sorry. We have tried our best, but your crocodile lost too much blood. Oh no. No! And this was stuck inside his throat. What is that? That is mine. 11,700 baht! Why is it so expensive? The treatment fee is 1,200 baht. Another 10,500 is for the damage to the equipments. Where am I supposed to get that kind of money? Let me pay. If it wasn't for me, this wouldn't have happened. Everyone went through so much trouble. Thank you all so much for helping me. Actually, the extra money you took is partly the bank's fault. You got an extra 20,000 baht, right? Correct. I wanted to return it, but I already bought Jack with it. His full name is Jackpot. The fortune teller said if I have a pet named Jackpot, it will increase my luck. What about you, Mrs. Aumara? I bought new washing machines with all the money. What about you guys? A down payment for the bike. I lost my tooth a while back and I feel embarrassed, so I got a gold implant. Okay. I will tell the bank that I couldn't track down the people who took the money. Hey, what about our deal? We owe these people our lives. Pued. Pued. Pued, stop! Turn around. So cute. You're crazy, darling. Damn! What the hell is wrong with you two? You aren't in love. You won't understand. Do you think you are so cute? Gosh. Such a waste of time waiting for you losers! The woman from that room left this for you. - Thank you. - Welcome. PUT THE WHEELS BACK IN FOR ME. What about you, Ms. Aummara? I bought new washing machines with all the money. What about you guys? A down payment for the bike. SOUND CLIP EVIDENCE CASE: LOST CASH FROM ATM Sir, today's meeting has been postponed. Okay. Keep me updated. Sir, please sign here. Go over this again. - Has legal team gone over this yet? - All done. You can start the legal proceedings. We need to prosecute to the full extent. What about you, Ms. Aummara? I bought new washing machines with all the money. What about you guys? - Well done, Ms. Jib. - A down payment for the bike. I lost my tooth a while back, so I got a gold implant. Thanks. Hello? Yes, this is Ekalak. What? Shit! Mr. Sua! Hey, didn't your girlfriend say she's going to handle this? Why is the bank still calling? They said they have our voice clips and will sue us. Here is 130,000 baht. The total amount that was taken. Good job. - Yes? - Ms. Jib, Mr. Sua recovered all the money and returned it to the bank. Please inform the legal team to cancel the proceedings. All right. Yes? Mr. Sua, please come to my office. Where did they get the money? They took out a loan. Okay, since you recovered the money, that means I lost. I will talk to my boss about quitting. Jib. They didn't get a loan. That was the money for our wedding. What? You used our wedding money to pay it back? You made me. How could you sue them after everything they did to help? Please don't change the subject. Do you know what you're doing? What about you, Jib? You want to win so bad, nothing else matters. Don't you think that's selfish? You don't want to get married, do you? You never wanted to propose anyway, right? That's a separate issue. Don't mix them together. Just admit it! - You didn't want to propose. - I was trying to find a solution. So you wouldn't have to hide and pretend or feel paranoid and stressed out. Is that your solution? No need to hide. A breakup is simpler. Do you mean that? Yes, I do. - Seriously? - Yes! Fine. Let's break up. The wedding's off. I am sorry. Wait up. Sorry. Sorry. Thank you. - Whose 1,200 baht is this? - From all of us. We will pay you back in small installments. When it rains, comes the same question "Are you tucked in a blanket?" Every morning, "How are you today?" Love you my darling, no matter what day I will always say "love" What is this? JIB, BETTER USE YOUR TIME TO GET READY TO BE MY HOUSEWIFE - SUA. - Yeoh? - Yes? Please get Mr. Sua for me. - Okay. - Don't. I will resign. Hey! What? That was slick of you. What's that? Don't act innocent. What does she see in you? She gave up her career for you. - Did she quit? - Yes. Hey, about Jib's boobs... I never really noticed them. You remember when I said Jib has really big boobs? When she walks, it bounces up and down. I was just kidding, all right? The thought never crossed my mind. Not even once. What? I'm going out. Let me hear the girls scream! Tonight, the ghosts who are still single, dance until your heads fall off! Tonight was supposed to be our wedding party. It would have been if someone hadn't taken the money and used it. Jib. You did the right thing though. It was my fault. I wanted to win so badly. I've caused so much trouble. Please tell them I'm sorry. You know, I quit my job. What? Are you crazy? What were you thinking? I quit, so that you can keep yours. Why did you quit? Because I am just kidding! I didn't quit. Hey, that is not funny at all. Have you ever heard of the word "appropriate"? How could I quit? If I did, who would take care of you? What if I propose to you again? What would you say? What if I say no? What would you say? If there's nothing else, I'm going downstairs. How about this? Rock-paper-scissors to determine if we marry or not? Is everything just a game to you? If I lose, you have to marry me, okay? If I lose, you must marry me. One. Two. Three. Jib, will you marry me? You're the only person in my life whom I don't mind losing to. I love you so much, Jib. Marry me? Then, you lose. What's taking you so long? You made it sound complicated. I wasn't sure if I understood you correctly. I know you aren't stupid. May I kiss my fiancée now? Up to you. No. Jerk! All the couples in the house, let me hear some noise! In those days that we are apart In those days that you're lonely I just want to let you know That my love is always with you In those days that we are apart In those days that I'm not beside you You might find someone But please don't give your heart to them You can look at them But don't fall for them Otherwise, I will be heartbroken You can talk to them, but not too long Don't be too close to them Because I will get hurt You can be as friendly as you like But not too much I'm afraid you will be more than friends Please, don't flirt with them Don't share your love to anyone besides me Yes, I do know. - Jennifer... - Aniston?
