Oh, God. Wow. That's a nice bathing suit. Amazing. Oh, God. Beautiful. Dude, I am so jealous. Let me see. Oh yeah, Ko Samui. Why did you come back from Thailand...? Who's that? Dylan. Why did you come back from Dylan? I know, right. Hiiiii. Hiiiii. Save yourself. I love that. That bird painting. Yeah, the prison market. A prisoner painted that. Birds mean freedom. Really. Man, I should paint birds. Zoe, what am I doing. I hate nursing, I can't be a nurse. I told you that last year. Everyone on your shift is going to die. I would save some. Like Dylan. I would save Dylan. Ugh, God. It stinks in here. Yeah, I dunno about this room... You have a guest! Hello! Not now Bubbles, shut the door. Darren Danowski, HIV negative. She said shut the door. She seems nice. Is this where the roofie party's at? The what party?! Hey you guys can roofie me... just no photos. See ya, guys. Okay, I'm okay with photos. Really nice chat, Zoe. Okay, we'll see you later, alright. Ba-bye! Umm Zoe, you have a serious bro problem in this building. Do they have spray for that, or traps? God. Court and... Bubbles? Bubbles-in-the-Tub. You must know him, that YouTube guy. He had the viral video. He was the baby farting in the bathtub. Wow, husband material. They're the Kappa Pho guys. They're having that huge Halloween party. We should go! No thanks. Shit. A Halloween Party for Grace. What the fu... With ghosts and goblins and vampires. But what are you really afraid of? Hey Zoe, you have a virus! I've seen that. It's a Halloween meme. A what? You're supposed to write in your worst fear before the counter goes out. Otherwise it comes to life. How does it know my name? Technology. Okay...? Hey. How do I get rid of this thing. Just let the timer run out, a scary clip comes up. Well, you said my fear would come to life! It's a meme. Saved. Okay, that was dramatic. You know if you put your fear in you don't see the video. Well, how would it know my worst fear? It's a meme. It knew your name didn't it. Yeah. That's true. That's pretty good hacking. What's the clip? Uh, it's a witch. It's bad. I hate horror stuff. You know spiders don't go up there. You don't know that. They could. It's warm. And beautiful. It's a dumb phobia. Alright, what's your worst fear. Nothing. I'm a Lady Chuck Norris. You're fucking scared of everything... - Lies... - Tell me. No. Ooo, you're hiding something. Tell me. Fucking tell me. Fine. It's pigs. - What. - Yeah, oink oink. Those things. Oh my God, that's so stupid. Every Halloween my brother gets a pig mask and chases me... worst fucking nightmare. Dude. Pigs are not scary. At least spiders are like, you know, evil. Pigs are... Dude, they're pink. Here. I got it one Christmas. Farmer Dell? Still fucking freaks me out. They're people-ish, they wear clothes, they talk. But they're still pigs. Hooves and tails. And those little black eyes. Unblinking. Mindless. Creepy. And now you have a pig phobia. No, I got that after. After what? What. I'll tell you but. It's fucked. You know my spider story, you have to tell me. Okay so, growing up, there was this farm down the road. And there was this mean old drunk farmer, Mr. Hannaman. And for whatever reason, Hannaman didn't always feed his animals. And if pigs don't eat, they go crazy, they'll eat anything. So one night, Hannaman, drunk as a monkey, sitting on the barn fence, screaming at his animals... Falls in and the pigs eat him. They eat everything. They opened the largest and found the farmer's teeth. Even his leather boots. Eww. Okay, so now you're scared of pigs. No. Wait. So a couple days later dad goes down to the farm. The pigs are gone. What? Where? No one knew. The fence was fine. Gate was locked. But I can tell you this. The woods behind our house. Something was in there. Pigs? Something. You could hear noises, but they weren't animal sounds. And then. I saw it. Behind our shed. In the trees. Standing. Those little black eyes. Unblinking. Mindless. No way. And that's when it said something to me. What? What?! What?! Fuck! Fuck! You are a fucker! Oh my God. Shit, it's late. Ugh, phone, where's my phone. It's getting dark out so no wonder I believed your bullshit. It's actually true. Sure it is. No I'm being serious, I saw something behind my house. - Pig people? - Hey look. I got one too. How does it know our names? What should I put. I don't know. Small dicks. It should be that. As if you discriminate. Put in Pig People. Wait. Don't you want to see the witch? Oh. Yeah, okay. Oh. This is... Alright. Zoe, your worst fear is coming for you. Yeah there's nothing scary about this. - We gotta go. - Alright, alright, I'm coming. Thanks. Oh, no. - Yo, what's up. - Yeah, where you guys going? Come on let's break down some college barriers. Turn down the bro dial, okay. Can you turn mine down for me? Saw your dial on YouTube, no thanks. I was 2 years old! And I was in a tub! It's from the yoga studio. - Like the lobby area. - Yes. - Why would she take your shoes? - I know. - There's Vicki. - I gotta go. - Thanks for the ride, honey. - Okay, byeeee! Okay. Sorry, sorry, sorry, let's go. Let's kill this. ...decides he's going to try and do a back flip, from the poles. Oh, you're kidding. How'd that end. - Not well. - Oof. So, Buddy does his back flip. Lands on his head. But he's so drunk, he gets up like it never happened. Oh my God. So, I don't know how you do it, but I normally go in sections. Start in dresses and then work your way that way. Sounds good, I'm a counting tornado. Don't know if you'll be saying that at 2 A.M. Peeing! Vicki? Oh my God! What the fuck?! Help! For fuck sake. What. What?! Ma'am? Are you okay? Why don't you come with me. I'm not sure. - Do you want this? - It's like a snout. What did you just say? What did you say? Did you just say "snout"? Let me see that. It's a crime scene photo, Gracie. I want to see it. Grace, you coming? I don't feel well. They're gonna record these soon. Sounds good. You're going to get kicked out, and they're not going to let... Hey Charlotte, I got a mom, okay? Char! Char! I'm sorry. Can you tell Davies that I'll be there tomorrow. Um, Spencer? Hey, Special! Guys! Oh my God, look! It's... it's... it's a girl! Oooo, a girl! A live one! Why aren't you pixelated? Please accept my beautiful virginity. Can I smell your hair? Can I put your hair in my mouth? You read my texts. Okay, you are good. Either he's good, or you need to update your iOS system. Never text on the campus wi-fi. I don't... They're just saying you need to update your phone. Sorry, my friend didn't mean to be a jerk, she... I don't know if I can help you. What are you looking for exactly? Can we sit somewhere? So she didn't type Pig People. She let the counter run out. And then you said a witch? Yeah, and something like "your worst fear is coming for you". - Who tweeted this? - The name's on there... LaPointe, I think? I talked to him on the phone, he's a real reporter. - It's definitely a pig. - Yeah. I called the police about this, twice. And both times they listen politely and then someone from Victim Services calls me back and asks if I need to talk to someone. So clearly, I am crazy conspiracy girl... You know how she died, right? - Yeah, I heard... - Mauled. Partially consumed. Obviously, it's just some guy who knew about Zoe's pig phobia. But... mauled? I mean, sounds like an animal. It's a pretty fucked up coincidence. Yeah, I'd say so. So have you ever heard of this 'virus' or whatever? Yeah, last year, at the Shit-the-Bed-Party I think someone was talking about it. Yeah, I was at that. Greyson House, that's Zoe's dorm. Yeah. I dunno, this shit's just pretty weird. It's definitely weird. Let's see what we find. So how did it know our names? Scanned your email? But it was my name on Zoe's computer. Keyboard patterns? I've never used her computer before. There's nothing in MemeCulture. Let's check the boards. Nothing on T Malware, "But What Are You Really Afraid Of"... - Is this a camera? - Yeah. We do the live feeds for bio-sci. Those are duck eggs. Ducking cool man. Here we go, missing persons report... - Missing persons? - No citations. - They're not here. - What's not there? Oh, Scrute, they're like myth busters for the internet. They have a Google reference on the meme, which is pretty recent, which is huge, it's related to a missing persons report. But there's nothing on the Google side. See those semi-colons in the code? That means there was other code there. - I have no idea... - It means it's good. Good? It's 'clip art'. It can alter Google. I couldn't do that. This whole lab couldn't do that. Okay, so what does all of that mean? It means shit's weird. You said it was on her phone, right? - Can I see that? - Police have it. But it was also on her computer. That's still there. - Can I see that? - Yeah. - Now? - Why not. Okay, let me just get some stuff. - Stuff? - Nerd stuff. Yeah, get all of the nerd stuff. Whoa a girl, take a photo! Yeah, I heard that before. I'm gonna start this up, okay? Yeah. - You alright? - Yeah. No, I just haven't been here since so... I won't be long. Find anything yet? Nope. But I just started, like, now. Right. I'm not that good. What the... Fucking Gestapo! They trashed the closet! - Who? - Cops! Why would they come back? - Are you sure it was them? - Better be them. Someone's been in here. Could you call them? No, I can't call them, they think I'm nuts... Fuck! They never re-key dorm rooms. Check it out. - Duck camera. - Yeah. Look, there's an app, you just put it on your phone and then it's motion-activated. Cool. Just keep it, it's the lab's, it's super cheap. You can put it in here and then if someone comes in you'll know. Thanks, Spencer. You are full of surprises. Nerds will surprise you for sure. I really like that you identify as like an '80s nerd. Are you kidding, those are my favourite movies. Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Breakfast Club... They're so good! I think it's 'cause they're will-they-fuck movies. But I guess like, all movies are. What. Oh, will-they-fuck movies. My friend Bob has this theory that every movie... Well, pretty much every story... comes down to that one question: Will They Fuck. And it keeps it compelling. It keeps us wondering if the main characters are going to do it or not. Oh. Not us. I didn't mean like that. - No, of course not. - Sorry. I just... people that are not. Me, or You, or real. Good thing we're not in a movie then, so we don't have to worry about that. Yeah. Grace? Oh hey, Bubbles, it's still kind of... I just wanted to say I was really sorry. Zoe was really great. I was stoked she was going to be down here this year. - Thanks, bud. - Hey, Special. Bubbles-in-the-Tub. - You guys old friends? - BFFs. I just wanted to check in and... That's my name. - Spencer? - I see it. Why is my name on your computer? "But what are you really afraid of"... - What is this? - How does it know he's here? - I don't know, I... - Okay, let me try this... Just let me do... Hey it's my name so, out of the way Special Needs. Okay, don't fart around, just put in your worst fear. Dancing pumpkins! I want to make sure we get this. - What am I afraid of? - The counter's running out. - What could be worse. - You have to be honest. Stop freaking me out. The clock's ticking, 20 seconds. I don't know what I'm scared of. - Yeah, you do. - Okay, hurry! Your worst thing, come on. Oh, my God. Amazing. Why didn't you just put in your worst fear? - I did! - Really. The Exorcist? Yeah, that movie fucked me up. It is really scary. Yeah, we named our cat Captain Howdy. Okay, that's actually amazing. Thanks for the 1990s, Atari, spooky, spooky meme. It is very scary. See you later, crocodile. Okay, bye. - Everything okay, did it work? - No. Which is kind of impossible. I don't know, I've got to take them back, see what's going on. Alright, let me help. I'm just over here, so I'll see you... You don't want a ride? Well, I'm in the Grotto, I live right around the corner. I got my mom's mini-van. Gracie! Hey, Court. I wrote you after Zoe's service. Yeah, sorry, it's, you know... If there's anything that any of us at Kappa Pho can do, just let us know, okay? What you are doing for Halloween? Uhh, not really sure... It's the big Kappa House Halloween party, - you coming girl? - Uhhmmm... It's the biggest party of the year. Drinks. Pumpkins. Drinks. - Come early! - Thanks, I probably will. Spencer, sup brah? - Court. - Looking sexual! - Cool. - You come by too okay broheem? Hey, Gracie. Ask me who. Ask me who! Who? You, that's who. You. - Holy shit. - Yep. Uh, you know him? I do know Court, lucky me. - Seems into you. - Can you walk me to my car because he actually gives me goosebumps. - Douchebumps. - Yeah, exactly. That whole Bro Posse. They're magnificent, Court's magnificent actually. He's like the alpha-bro. He reminds me of a Centaur. I guess. Are you really going to their Halloween party? Are you kidding. I'd rather be eaten alive by birds. I'm totally going. - Oh, yeah? - Oooooh, yeah. Gonna hose myself down with Axe. Watch Entourage. Practice giving my bro-hemes high fives. It's gonna be great. Sounds great. So you went to school with those guys, hey? - Bet that was fun. - It was super fun. And they gave you the name "Special"? Yeah, Court himself, Grade 7. It could have been worse. "Bubbles-in-the-Tub". Oh we had a kid named "Fartparty". Even his mom called him that. Oh my God. Thanks for helping me with all this. At least now we know it's not, you know, real. The Halloween virus? I know I sound like a crazy person but I actually started to think that it worked. It didn't work with Bubbles. He put in his fear and he still got the witch. Well, I'm pretty sure Bubbles' worst fear isn't The Exorcist. And how would you know that? I've known Darren Danowski since we were five. I know his worst fear, it was the whole neighbourhood's. The Tall Man. The Tall Man? That's what we called him. When we were little he used to watch us at the playground. Oh my God that sounds like an after school... Seriously, it happened. Alright what would he do? Just watch us. But this one day... He started coming towards us non-stop. Oh my God. He came right up. Right into the sandbox and grabbed Bubbles screaming. Took off with him. And today Bubbles would probably be on milk cartons but Toomy's dad drove up and Tall Man let him go and ran off. He didn't come back to school for months. Man, you just made me feel sympathy for someone named "Bubbles-in-the-Tub". I know, right. I'm gonna look at this stuff and get back to you right away, okay. - Okay, thanks Spencer. - Yeah. Okay. See ya. ...harnesses all the power out of a galaxy. Now, think about how far our civilization has advanced in only 100 years. Now, think about planet A, with an extra 5.5 billion years of evolution, think of how much more different things are for them... No, no, no, no, no, no. - Jesus! - Bubbles? He's coming. He's coming. He's coming. He's coming. He's coming! Who is it? What's going on Mr. Danowski? Who do you see? No! Don't open it! What on earth is going on! You can't! You can't! You can't! It's Pardeep! What did you do Pardeep!? Perfect. Would you like chicken on your chimi-cheese? Hello? Hello? Can I help you? Hellooo? What can I help you with? Sorry, can I get a chimi-cheese and a coke. No problem! Would you like chicken on your chimi-cheese? No, thanks. No problem, that'll be 8.75. Fuck sake. What? What?! - It forwards! - What? The virus, it forwards itself! But only if you get the saved screen. So it didn't send an email with Bubbles, but it would've with you. - The meme sends an email. - Yeah, to a random contact. Dot? Dorothy, that's Zoe's stepmom. - She died like 2 years ago. - Shit. You wish that Dot got the virus? Yeah, we're trying to capture it. Is this seriously why you got me out of bed. That's just the beginning, look. The clock's ticking, 20 seconds! I don't know what I'm scared of! Watch when I hit the contrast. Rectangles? It's a rune. A Rune, like from the druids? Exactly like from the druids. The cross is 'man' and the box is 'obstacle'. Literally 'those who hide'. But figuratively, it's a reference to those who walk the darker side or the hidden path or whatever. It... it means demons. Demons? Of course. Dante uses it in The Inferno to mark the debauchery of the Venetian masquerade balls. What's with all the masks. They look more drunk than Demon. Yeah, you're thinking of the Christian version, like little horns and red suits and stuff. Demons actually way pre-date Christianity. Back in Dante's time they weren't really considered to be part of Satan's squad. - What were they then? - Demons were people. People who had gone off. They were said to be 'born of suffering', creatures created 'of pain'. Intense suffering, if you survived it, could turn you into something powerful. Suffering, from like, rats? Or like from the cold? You're shit at history. I am shit at history. Okay, it's medieval Europe, so you got like Inquisition, you got Famine, Plague, pick your dinner party! Okay, I get it, things were tougher... A little tougher! - I suffer. - How. When my wi-fi is slow. - Suffering's changed. - Yes. Okay, fine. Well maybe that's why we see less demons these days "Those that hide their eyes, those to take the earth to ruin." It's so weird. It gets weirder, look. Do you see something, other than the witch? Woah, what was that. It's a frame glitch. Let me bring it out. Jesus. 4, 5. That is scary. Scarier than that witch. The guys that made it? Apparently. So what does that mean? Basically nothing. It's your typical blackhat bullshit. Yeah, it seems pretty dumb. Still, that's weird. Cops. Upstairs. - What?! - What?! Cops. Relax, it's not about us. It's about the guy who died. Someone died? The guy who freaked out. Wait what? Seriously? Ever heard of this thing called "the news"? - Holy shit. - Is that real? Is that real?! Shit, sorry. - He was your friend. - No no, he was just... We saw him yesterday. What do you mean he freaked out? He said someone was trying to kill him. Then he went crazy, ran off campus. This doesn't say where he died. At the playground. Both times it appeared, it was in Zoe's room. So the meme connects to her room somehow. Or her stuff. I mean, could it just be the computer that's haunted, or whatever? I cloned the drive, it didn't seem haunted. What about back there, all those cords and shit? It's just cords and shit. And dust. I have no idea what we're doing. It's the closet! We were in there when Bubbles came over, and Zoe was in there the night that she died. It is the fucking closet! Okay, watch the screen. Spencer! It's the floor. It's my name again. It must be whoever's closest maybe. - Okay, I have to answer. - Yeah. It's not... the mouse! - Did you unplug this?! - Shit. Fuck. Alright, you're good. - There you go. - Shit. The keyboard's out! Fuck sakes, Spencer! I see it, shit! Sorry! 20 seconds, hurry! Yeah, you're good. Oh my God! Fuck! Shit! - Okay. - Oh my God. Oh my God, fuck. Fucking hell. The floor's the trigger, I dropped a weight right on it. A haunted closet. Holy shit. It drops half an inch here. Dude, I'm not going in there! Watch the screen again. Just... just go slow! Brick. Some are rotting. This one's loose. They bricked something up. Like what? Okay, so this overlay has the original 14 structures from 1860. And you can see the tunnel system linking them all, here. So these are the old tunnels, right? Yes, this network here. Let me see if I can find this on a better... I played Dungeons & Dragons down here once. - Spooky! - Stop trying to out-nerd me. Yes this one's better, you can see what's changed. So Greyson House used to be part of the old hospital? Yeah, this whole area did. Greyson, Lennox, Henry. And when did it become a residence? Greyson House. 2002? Yes. Before it was just a normal hospital building? Well, all the residences were patient care. And this whole area here was pediatric, and Greyson House was... palliative. Oh my God. - Wait, what's palliative again? - Terminal. So you're saying that our dorm rooms used to house dying children. Some did, I'm afraid so. Children that were dying. Do you know anything about this part here? That was a cancer hospice. Oh, that's right, the last of the Balloon Babies were there! - What? - Hold on. This is roughly Zoe's dorm and there's stairs that go down to a sub basement. But in the 2010 map the stairs and the basement are gone. Bricked up? Maybe. Excuse me, there's a staircase here and it's not in this map, do you know what would have happened to it? Filled in, abandoned maybe? Here, it's one of the better books. There's a whole section in 920. "Balloon Babies and Jelly Children of the Northeast" Are you kidding, this can't be a thing! What is this? It was a disease cluster in the 80s. In the river basin, that area. It was a chemical leak that affected newborns. Balloon Babies and Jelly Children? Named for the way their flesh grew uncontrollably. These kids were seriously disfigured. This is disturbing. Most covered their faces. Not one lived past their teens. It's a very sad story. These kids lived in Greyson? They did. Also, hang on. Oh. My God. The Halloween Party. There's a documentary. The DVD is missing, but we do have it on 16mm. We've got some portable projectors and screens. It's a bit dated, but you might learn something. Wow, just... wow. - Could we borrow all this? - Yes. This is a library. Always wondered how you guys worked. God. How did people watch stuff in the old days? Seriously, people were basically animals before Netflix. ...that's because they were condemned even before they were born. But the lack of safety enforcement led to a chemical leak. The chemists at the factory were using a new dye which contained a compound called Fallocarbide. Once it got into the river and the surrounding groundwater the compound broke down into its component elements some of which possessed horrendous toxicity. It affected an entire generation. You see Fallocarbide wreaked havoc upon the human fetus. Oh my god. And there were many children... I am so fucking upset right now. Those kids. You know, I thought I didn't want kids before, but I can literally feel my ovaries going into my armpits. Why are we watching this? Why do you keep taking pictures of it? I... I don't know. I... doesn't this disturb you that these kids lived in our dorm rooms? It's nuts! Jesus. Hey, hey, hey, I got something. It forwarded? Is that it? What's that spinning thing? Kind of a robot, it's putting a shell on for a scan. Spencer, we have to destroy this thing. After the scan's done I'll kill it. Do you think it actually works? Do you think that Zoe got killed by a Pigman and then Bubbles' worst fear just came to life? I don't know, but I'll tell you this, if that happened to me, I would not sit around and scream like I was in a horror movie. I would drop everything, get in the car, and drive to fucking Cleveland! - Airport. - Even better. The Halloween Party. Looks like a birthday. Um, can I ask you something? Vagina spiders. Spencer! - Well what... - Oh my god! You typed it in and I was there, and I've never heard of that - so I kind of like wondered. - Alright, fine. When I was a little girl, I fell asleep on the beach one time and when I woke up I had a tummy ache, and my sister told me that while I was asleep, a spider had crawled "up there" and laid eggs. So... they're real?! - You're an idiot. - What?! You said you had a tummy ache! It was old potato salad or something, my sister was joking around, she was pranking me. Aah, okay. Okay. Anyway, I believed her at the time, and ever since then I've hated crawly things, I'm just scared of where they'll go! Yeah, that's fair. What about you, what's your worst fear? Bears. That was fast. What's the story with that? Why do I need a story?! Their jaws can crush bowling balls! They're killing machines! It's just random. I just can't believe that we live in a world where there's bears running around, right now, this very second, outside, hungry, and we're worried about ISIS? It makes no sense! Did you just see that? They were placed in a ward, part of the palliative care wing. And the goal was to keep them busy to try to distract them from their pain and from their anguish. An "intus etin" state, which literally means "to be born inside-out". And yet he survived, placed in a modified hospital bag. Chronic bleeding. Respiratory issues. His entire life spent in unimaginable agony. And yet despite all that showing a remarkable will to survive. To live. Good lord! Balloon Babies are absolutely fucked! - They're totally fucked! - Oh my god. Tomorrow's Halloween, that is timing! Spencer, look at this! Do you see? - Computers? - Yeah. That's something. - We need to talk to someone. - Him. But gradually one by one they died, until all but a few bed-ridden cases remained. Got him. Doctor Arthur MaCail, he retired '09. His wife is a Doctor Barbara MaCail, and two kids, Leo and Alison. You're like a superhero. There's a phone number. No way, calling is way too intense. He's like 70. Okay yeah, we'll send him a snap-chat. You're starting to grow on me. It's ringing. What?! Hello, Grace! Doctor MaCail, thanks so much for having us! - Come in, come in! - Okay, thank you so much. Arthur will be up in a jiff. Oh, we've just been setting things out for the children later, but help yourself if you like! - Oh, I'm fine. - I'm good thanks. Or would you like a fruit shake? I've just had one! They're fantastic! Yeah! Thanks! Of course, I wouldn't have been involved if not for Arthur. Sick children are the saddest thing you can imagine. They are. You're making it less sad. Sorry. It's a good shake, yes? So good. Right then, so what about this photo. Of course, they are in here. My heart. May I? You can't remember every patient, but these children, I think I recall every one of them. They we're so young here! Oh, Michael. Bone problems I'm afraid. And Laurence. They loved their bricks. Now that's a happy day. That's how I like to remember them! "The Halloween Party" what does that mean? That's what they called them. Why would they call them that? - The masks, and the hoods. - Of course. For you it's just one day a year, but for them, Halloween was every day. It was a cruel nickname. That's the photo right there. Oh yes, the older ones had a club. With computers? Yes, they were teenagers. What would they do in that club? I suppose whatever one does with computers. The staff appreciated it. They were terrible to the staff at this point. What do you mean? As they got older, they became something else. It happens with the terminally ill. I'm not sure that I understand. Imagine being born disfigured. Your home, the hospital. Tied to machines that are breathing for you and pumping for you. Your condition worsening. Your flesh growing out of control. And your loved ones visiting less and less often until one day those visits just stop. These children felt all of that. We watched each one lose everything. It would twist them into something no longer human. A creature wanting to lash out. At who? At the company that poisoned the ground. At the city that let them. At the people who just wanted to forget. Us. Yes. They blamed us for their fate. All of us. And at the very end they were no longer sick children. They were monsters. What did you mean at the very end? They took themselves off of assisted care. The remaining five. I imagine the pain was too great. - Suicide. - Oh my God. And I believe it was time to let them rest. Ma'am? Ah, thank you. Arthur's up, shall we- Doctor MaCail, does this mean anything to you? No. No, I don't know what that is. Come, we'll ask Arthur. Oh Darling, come, up we go. Darling, these are the young people I told you about from the university who want to ask some questions about children's palliative. Hey Doctor MaCail, so nice to meet you. H. E. L. L. O. Hello. Hello! Thank you so much for having us! Your home is beautiful and Barbara has been lovely! She made us a fruit shake which was very good! Well, we were just interested in the work that you did, in the documentary that you had, many years ago, had the uhh... Well, we enjoyed watch... But we had some questions about it as well, so just kinda wanted to talk about that and... - Here try this. - Okay. That's good. Sir, do you recognize this image? Arthur?! Arthur?! Arthur?! L L L L L L L L L L Arthur?! Please. Arthur?! Arthur?! Leave! - We are so sorry. - That's alright. Attacks happen I'm afraid. Thank you for understanding. My dear, would you wait a minute? Of course. I wanted to give you this. Arthur gave it to me, it's an Indonesian Garuda, a talisman of luck and protection. Something tells me you may need it. In the end, the children wanted to hurt us. Bring that back, it means something to me. Thank you. What the hell was that?! L L L L! - Sounded like hell, hell, hell- - I know! What was he trying to say, flee? - FLLLEEEEEEEEEE! - Could have been anything, I swear a little poop came out of me! Maybe he was just in pain or something? He was definitely trying to say something! Spencer, those kids died down there. And when you hit the brick it disrupts their grave! - We need to tell someone. - And say what? Oh hey guys, guess what. It actually turns out that Zoe's closet is the grave of the Halloween Party. Oh, who's that you ask? Well, it's just a hacker group of revenge-seeking demons. You know, some deformed teenagers that, in a suicide pact, poured their souls into the world's scariest virus. Which, by the way, fucking works, and will kill you with your own worst nightmare! It doesn't sound good. No. We just leave it and we hope no one disturbs it? It's pretty hard to disturb. We disturbed it. Three times. - Someone else will. - That's not our problem. Not if their worst fear is airborne Ebola, that's everybody's problem. Spencer, we have to delete it. And then we have to fix the brick. And we can't tell anyone about it. Not a soul. You told someone! Just a couple guys at the lab and they actually helped me catch it! Why didn't you delete it last night! You need to destroy this thing like yesterday! Okay, it's done. It's done. It's gone. It's deleted. - It's gone? - Gone. Oh. - That was fast. - It's not that hard. You just go in and hit delete. Problem solved. Problem solved. And that's all of it? There's the email that it was attached to, so if we want to be super safe you could drop me at the lab now I'll go in and delete it right away. Tomorrow, we'll get some mortar, we'll fix up the closet floor, and it will be sealed for good. Okay. This is going better than I thought. I might actually sleep tonight, not wake up screaming, being chased by the Pigman. Chased by The Halloween Party. Ugh God, exactly. - Wow, those kids! - They're fucked. Seriously, I think something finally beats bears. You're insane, bears are cuddly. You're a crazy person. My God. Hey. Do you know if Spencer's horror meme is in the Box? No idea what you're on about. His Halloween thing. - You don't know about it!? - No. It asks your worst fear, and if you don't answer before the clock runs out, that fear comes to life. Well, I doubt it because, you know, real life. The guy who died, he watched it. You think a meme killed Darren Danowski? You guys talking about the horror app? Susy Landlow was in the class the day Bubbles died. She said he came in laughing about it. An hour later, dead! Okay, I need to see this thing. I'd put the Shining Twins, imagine them running around campus. You'd just fall in love. I'd put dinosaurs! Fight them with construction equipment, I would Michael Bay up that shit! Lipman! Can you get in to Spencer's horror app? No, it's in the Box. Where's his laptop. I can get in there... Okay, text me. It's starting already. Gah, that's all we need, more kids in masks. No kidding. Okay, text you when it's deleted. - Okay bye. - Bye. Motherfucker! Who?! Who?! - Everybody. - Don't be... Who answered it? Who answered it? - Did you see a witch? - There was a- Did you see a witch? No, I typed clowns and saw little dancing ghosts! - It said 'saved'! - It said 'saved'! - Not a big deal man! - Sorry, Spencer man. It forwards! Garret, Garret, okay. - Garret. - Forwards? An email? One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Guys, I'm so stoked for tonight. Like, I want to die tonight. I'm not even kidding. I want to die of booze. Do you think we got enough? Garret, my son, there's enough liquor in this room to get the Russian army drunk. Fuck you! I see your point, Michael. We could always use more. We can always use more! I'm worried it's going to catch on fire or something. It could happen. Gentlemen, I predict 100 years from now, they're going to be singing folk songs in the mountains about this Halloween party. Dude, I am so pumped. Yo, want some punch. No, I can't be slurring when handing candy to children. - Sounds like a wager to me man. - Candy? This Halloween let's give out soup. Yeah, he's right here. Hey Garret, someone for ya bro. Spence, what's up homeslice. Spence, whatcha drinking pal. Heya Garret, have you checked your phone, did you get an email? Uhh, no, no, phone's upstairs I think. You look like you're going to have a heart attack, Spencer. Have some relaxing punch, dude. I'm good, thanks. Whose is this, can I? Our house is your house, Spencer. Just bear with me alright, this is important. Can you bring up your email? - What's going on brah? - Ooo. - Is this about that horror app? - No way! - It is isn't it!? - It totally is, isn't it! What horror app? The meme, you know the one that got Bubbs! There's this witch that's so scary it actually drives you insane, is that right, Spence? That sounds totally real. Okay, just put your password in but don't hit enter. Because then the whole thing is going to... - Shit! - Is that it? What's this? Dude that's it, I told you! But what are you really afraid of? - What the hell is this? - Listen to me. You have to put your very worst fear before that counter hits zero. And you have to be honest. Fucking awesome! What happens if he doesn't do it, does he die? Is this really the thing that Bubbles did? Seriously, he dies? This is the greatest moment of my life. Fucking awesome! I don't know what I'm afraid of! Put 'sex with Ribicki'. You're not afraid of nothing tiger! Will you guys shut up! Garret, just focus alright, the key is honesty. Can you just do it? No man, it's in your name. When was the last time you were really scared. A movie maybe? - I dunno. - 20 seconds, Schmitty. You gotta go deep okay, when were you scared as a kid. I don't know. Come on, worst childhood memory. There's got to be something. Uhh... - our deck? - The deck! The deck is high? - You're scared of heights? - No. What is it about the deck! - I fell off! - Is that your fear, falling?! - No. - 10 seconds! What about the deck scared you?! - I was pushed! - Who pushed you?! - I... - Who pushed you?! - 5... - What are you scared of? - 4, 3, 2... - Type it in, type it in now! Dude, where's the witch?! Is there no witch? That's lame. There's no witch unless you let the counter run out. What the fuck was that, Spencer? Did you make that thing to embarrass my friend? - No! That thing is real! - You come in here, you mine for personal info, and then you pull that shit?! No, no man, that's real okay, and it sends a random email - to a random contact... - Woah... "A Halloween Party for Spencer"! Woah! - Woah, woah, grab his arm... - What?! What! What are you doing?! Fuck! We want to see that witch Special. No, Court, you've got to let me go. You don't understand okay! I don't have to do anything, Special Needs. What the fuck! Garret, Garret, Garret, please, come on man, just type for me okay, just type The Halloween Party, okay. You know what? I think I want to see that witch too, Spencer. C'mon, you can't let it run out, don't let it run out guys! - 3... - No, no! - 2... - No! 1... That's lame. Jesus Christ. All this, for that? You are such a dick. Don't tell me, now you're going to die because your little virus said so, is that it? No Court, I'm not gonna die. We all are. Oh. We all are. Oh, whatever. Dude, he had the ending. I mean you gotta admit that was a good ending. We all are. We all are. We all... - Arrrre. - Will you shut up! Hi, this is Grace. Really? You're phoning me? What's wrong with you? Okay just text... Yeah, kids are out, I'm going to get my costume. - What are you again? - Surfer-Werewolf, dude. - What are you? - A garbage bag. Of course, you are. Don't open that door yet, I gotta drop some heat! The Mighty Bag shall wait until you finish your horrible shi... Oh fuck... Hello? Wiggs? Go away, I'm in the zone. I can totally see you, man. What do you want, a brown potato? I'll toss you one, straight from the cooker, you know, I will. What, I gotta close the door when I take a crap now? Stupid! Yo, O'Brian? Yo, O'Brian, you here?! Hi, Spencer! Hey, do you wanna help? It's a lot of fun! Spencer? You want to help? Actually I'm leaving, Violet, I just wanted to let... you know... Spencer? How long has that kid been there? Which one? Do you mean the boy with the skull mask? No, no, no... Who is that? Holy shit! Who is that?! You! Get back! Spencer! What are you doing?! I said get back! Back or I'll brain you! I know who you are! I'm Greg! It's Greg! Do you know, Greg? I didn't do anything I swear! Greg, you scared me! It's Halloween! Well take it down a notch, okay Greg? Take it down! What is going on?! Spencer, where are you going? Spencer!? Spencer!? Oh my god, Jonesy. You fucking scared me, buddy! Yeah. Jesus. - Where were you? - I was asleep, holy shit! - Holy shit. - Where are you?! I don't know, I came to my room. I think I gotta call my mom. Have you seen them? No, but they're coming, fuck! What are we going to do?! Okay, remember what you said. If it was you, you'd get in the car - and drive to Cleveland. - Airport. - Even better. - Let's do it. Visa, passport, cash, I'll meet you at the van in 5 minutes. It's at the parking lot behind Henry House. - 5 minutes. - 5 minutes. Fuck! - I saw them! - Me too! - Cleveland! - Fuck, yes! - Wait! - Fuck! - Is that one of them?! - Run it over! - No, I can't just run it over! - Run it over! - What if it isn't one of them?! - Run it over! Oh, my god. Fuck. Okay, okay. Okay, okay, okay, okay. There's no service! Spencer, Spencer! What the fuck are we gonna do, what the fuck?! We need to get off campus! Spencer, Spencer! - Keep it down. - Okay. I need you to keep it together, okay? - Okay. - Okay? Okay. Okay, I have one percent. Okay, where's your phone? Where's your phone? It's in the van. Shit, what's in your backpack? - There's this. - A charger. That's good, that's good. - And this. - Duck camera. They're infra-red, we could see in the dark. But it needs your phone. Okay, we need to charge my phone ASAP, look for an outlet. - Hey. - What? There's a door. Why the fuck is there no outlet. Shit, phone just died. Fumes. Awesome. Come on! Oh my god. The old hospital. Oh my god. - Fuck. - Shit. It's dead. Let me try. It's the boy from the book! Come on, let's go! What are you doing?! Grace! Let's go! Grace, come on! He's beauti... Is it following us? Where's the lighter?! - Where's the lighter?! - I don't know! Okay, okay. Red glow! An outlet! Fuck! - Give me the charger! - Okay. We're going to die down here. Then our audience won't find out. Find out what. Will they fuck? I've been here before. I was stoned here at frosh, we played D&D down here. Hey, if we put a camera on the end of this we could literally see in the dark. And the light won't attract those things. Do you know who else paints birds, prisoners. It means they want to be free. Spencer, they bricked them up! The balloon babies just want to be free? Yes! That's all they want, remember? That old guy, he said freeeee! Freeee! I thought you were saying that he said fleeee! We have to get to Zoe's room, we have to free them! The HUB isn't far from here. And the stairs to Greyson are right after that. Bring up the app for this. Okay. Holy shit, that is fucked. Okay, which way. That way. We're back in the main tunnel system. Yeah. The Foundry tunnel is straight ahead, and the stairs to Greyson are right after. Fuck! Oh my god, oh my god! Listen! Fuck, what is that?! Someone's there. Pan the camera, pan it! Oh, my god. Okay, okay. Okay. Okay, I think that's the door up there, - and over there... - What is that?! What? What?! Rotate the stick! Rotate it! I thought I saw someth... Oh, my god. Spencer?! Spencer! Spencer! Fuck! You coming? Yeah... Ummm, you know, I'm just... I'm going to be late. I just... I have to do something first. Okay, see you there. Okay. Oh hello, Grace! Dr. MaCail, I just wanted to return this to you. Oh goodness, thank you. Well, I hope it did you some good. It did, thanks. I also wanted to let you know that everything is going to be okay now. They're free. - I'm sorry? - We released them. And I think that they're at peace now. Released them? Yes. We took down the brick. - Are you mad? - What. Why do you think we bricked them in?! To protect us! To protect us all! Do you realize what you've done?! Save yourself. No, no, no, after the sea. No, no, that is ridiculous. She's my favourite, she's my favourite. No, no. No, no! We have to go back! We have to go back or we're all going to die! Please, listen to me, listen to me, we have to land this plane, I know that I sound like a crazy person but I can't sit down because this thing, on here, is going to kill us all! Listen, we have to talk to the pilot... I used to have nightmares, them crawling inside me. Spiders! Spiders! Ugh! They're crawling up my leg!
