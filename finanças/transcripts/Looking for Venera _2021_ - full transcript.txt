Sit down. Why do you come through mountain? There were workers in the tunnel. Clean that dirt from the shoes first. Get inside. LOOKING FOR VENERA He wet himself. Again. It's because of bad dreams, perhaps. If he was a she, I would go see that doctor. Leave that. I can't decide if he is a he or a she. Hands off! I don't want to be checked my a man. Leave it, I'll do it. I have dirt myself! It was a man. The same, I guess. I don't like that doctor. Mom! How have you been today? Fine. You look exhausted, my son. Eat it. Where is your mind? Keep it real, not all over. Talking to you as talking to a block of wood. Wood doesn't understand. Go to bed! Dad saying these things... It's because he thinks... I have done something up there? Have you ever seen me going through that mountain? Never. Why make people think I have taught you such things? Listen. Listen. Get in your pajamas. Didn't you get them? Things don't get here by themselves. Peeling potatoes, you would be good at that. Don't use this as an excuse to stay away from home. Teacher, I have to answer this. It's mom, you know! Sure, it's mom! I'd prefer if you stayed at home with your mom. Rather than coming here to make me look as if I am teaching you nothing. Don't worry teacher, I'll prove them wrong. I do as you told me. I watch films with subtitles covered. I am training teacher. But, I can't watch those films with my parents. I have to be alone at night. I swear, I've learned so much. You should'n stare at people like this. Does it hurt? Well... Sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't. Don't go through mountains, then. They'll see you. What do you mean? See what? Is that why you keep staring at me? Keep your mouth shut! Sure. I promise! When did you see us? Yesterday, after the class. What were you doing there? Not the same thing, I guess. No, I just took a shortcut. How did you like it? I thought he was hurting you... pushing you like that. He gets excited. Can't control himself when he's with me. Did you see him taking off my skirt? We started rolling downhill. My skirt took off. It flew all the way down by the miners. I had to chase after my skirt naked. They started clapping. I had to go to them, greet them and reclaim. I am lying. Cover up! Were you alone when you saw us? Yes, I was alone. Did I look cheap? Like I am falling for him. Dignity! That's the main thing. Imagine ending up like our english teacher. Have you seen how she laughs after boys. Her hormones are boiling. Imagine, she was so into a NATO soldier during the war. She was his translator. She did nothing about it, afraid people might talk. My dad and her dad were in the same squad. Her dad died first. I heard mom talking about it. Give me your number. I don't have one. Parents! They think they can control us. They say, the don't... I'll register Lum's number as "Venera". In case my brother checks. Young men, full of life. Like stallions. It will burn if you're not careful. It worries me... Don't hang around those hooligans! Don't leave your clock there, Nora. The kids will take it and break it. Wait, it will blow. They'll play with it. I can't push them away. They're my neighbors. That's right, don't push them away. But listen to Luan's advice. He's like a father to you. He means well. No one can be a dad to me. I know that. Nol, how is your mom doing? We don't have time for chattering. Ok then, sand her my regards. Poor woman, she's not doing too well. Again she touched my hair, that way. She talks about her dead son all day long. And then she touches my hair. It really scares me. Gets under my skin. Don't pay attention to such things. But it's not that simple. It's like a disease. I can't stand this smell. The smell goes away. Nol, when you start something, you must finish. The smell goes away, but... But words won't. It will move. You just push it and get to the other side. What do you mean it will move? - Simple, it's a swinging door. Nora looks tall. At her age I was not this tall. When I got married, they just built that big door. I felt so tiny next to it. Venera. Venera. I didn't know you two are friends. This is the song I was telling you about. The one my dad used to like. Have a seat, I'll get you some tea. The war took our best men. Your dad was a great man. He died so we could have a better days. I believe he's watching us from above. So, we have to show him we're happy. I really like this girl. Venera is nicer than me. I wonder what would I do without her at the course. I would fail my test. She's the smartest in class. Do you want it strong or weak? Let us prepare the tea. You take e seat. Leave it, Venera knows where the things are. Why don't you learn english my son, it might get you a better job. Go to your room. May I help Venera? You go on, sit down. You better go on and study. Have you ever been to The Factory? Why do you stand there?! It's better if we go to my place. But you just arrived. My mom is alone. She can't be alone. Ask your dad! You see Dorina's hair? We used to wash our hair with ash. Ash makes your hair like that. They all have parents, but that place is always full. Are you going home or you wanna come with us? Give the ball back. Let's have a beer. Are you coming? Let's have a drink together. Cat's got your tongue? You won't be able to drink, then. Just so you know, you lost all the girls. You won't be able to kiss either. What, you're all lost for words? Stick your tongues out and then we'll talk and become friends. Have you ever had fun? You know, like real fun! Hi! What would you like to drink? Coffee or something more special? Something stronger? Strong? What's the point? I'll be going home to mom. Make something that looks light. Don't worry, you will like it. How I'd love to kiss him. You know, I made the move. I kissed him first. I had already decided, it had to happen that day. I even had a fight with mom. She was insisting I have some pie. I told her I can't eat. I couldn't tell her the reason. I was worried that I'd stink onions. I had already planned it in my head. But, I was worried if the kiss would be right. Thank you. At least you have stories. You'll have them too. Look at you. You are not even wearing any make up. You'll be fine, you will see. What are you doing here? I'm talking to you. We're just having a drink. Go on, get going. Let us just finish the drinks. Who's this girl now? Venera, my best friend. No more drinks for those girls. They're done. That's what a juvenile brother looks like. Gent saw it all. It's embarrassing. Gent won't be bothered. He's used to these kind of things. I don't care either. I wanted to have sisters. But, it was not my fate. Why aren't you sleeping? Go on, close your eyes, try to get some sleep. Look at Dorina, asleep before her head hits the pillow. Go on now, close your eyes. If you can't sleep, that's a problem. I'm going now. Alright... Tell me how much you love him. It's not like that with him. He is the first one. So, you're experimenting?! Something like that. I wouldn't call it love. Did you see what was in his text? No, I didn't read it. What's up with you? Told you, can't leave her alone. You're so stubborn. Gent's right. Gent is right? Yes, he is! So let's see then, who's more stubborn, me or your brother? Whatever. I'll be back. Can I have that special one? Special what? Like the last time. I finished my shift, but... I won't let you thirsty. I got something to... Look, I have to go. He wants to surprise me with something. That's great. Just go. Are you going home? Can I give you a ride? I would rather walk. You're going home, right? Yes. I ride you home. - No, I better walk. I'll take you. I was at Dorina's. Don't worry, her brother gave me a lift. Your hair is soaking. Did you steal that cigarette from dad? You look tired, my girl! Nora... She was at Dorina's. Dorina! I will never lie to my husband again. Can you see how the position of the tongue changes? Man-Men. Your turn to read. It's you. Venera! Look at those men over there. Do I look like a fly? How is it going? Do you want some chocolate? Shall we have these? - You like that? It looks blend. What about this one? Never tried that one. Would you like to try it? I looks too sweet. Do you want chocolate or biscuits? Chocolate. Chocolate is sweet. Biscuits can be sweet as well. Take your time. High protein for hard labor. Let's take these. Don't worry about them. Four more of these. How are you guys, all good? Caught any rabbit today? A few. Really? I have no change. What's in total? - One and a half. I've got the change. Here you go. They're not fake, are they? Put them back if they are. Nah man, that's real money. All good? Goodbye. Have a good day. I'm catching the bus. It will be here soon. I mean, it should. Off I go, then. Open your mouth. Nora... Where did you leave my blouse? Who are these men? In black clothes, I look pale. Here it is. I got it, you see? The idea is important. I raised three kids in this baby cot, one after another. May they live long. Leave it here. These must be semisweet. Which one is without sugar? Mine seems cold. I'll just have a tiny piece, because I ate a lot today. My wife fried me up some eggs, good and proper. I am bloated. This english course it's a good idea, because without english today... We don't need these foreign influences. Can't you see they're going awry. Add some honey on top. Miri. Lovely day, ma'am. All the money is coming from foreigners. We thought they'll do more but... they could at least renovate our factory. They're aren't doing much. They're promising, we have to wait. I already asked them. They wanted roasted pumpkin. I am sure you asked them, but, I can't just walk in empty handed. That's right, mom. Welcome! Help yourself to baklava. Thanks for having us. Bless your hands. It's been a while since I eat this. Careful with the carpet. Your english course was finished over an hour ago. I was at Dorina's. I just lost track of time. I don't want to hear about it. I told you once. Why are you being like this? We've become good friends. I like being with her. And I finally decided to grow my hair. Stay away from her. Nothing good will come of it. All these able-bodied men! When I was a young women, you were all this tinny. Now this bodies require nourishment. We had enough, thank you! Stop before you sully your name. Sully my name?! What are you talking about? You're not like her. You're different. How different? Naive, clueless... shy? Have you ever asked me how I see myself? Who am I? What am I? This is her influence. No wonder, my dad would rather spend time with his wooden planks than with you. You speak to me of Dorina, instead of looking at yourself. It looks pretty modern. Let me try it. Push it, push it. Oh dear, mother of God. Is she allright? Get out of my way. Easy, it's not her fault. Mom, who broke the door? Mom, you broke the door? I have so many blouses and yet my face looks pale. Where are all those blouses, Where have you left them? They don't change place by themselves. At least these haven't been moved. I look pale in this black one. The men looked at me with pity. My earring! It fell somewhere. My marital earring. It's not a good sign. This is bad. This is very bad. I didn't do anything. My hair, my... Have you seen how I stand? I just went out and he followed me. But that day your eyes were shimmering. Than we stopped... Then we kept walking, I didn't know where we were going. I felt uncomfortable, I thought someone might be watching us. You were troubled, if he liked your kiss. You kept your mouth closed! Why on earth is touching someone's tongue a special thing? I thought it was going to be more about talking and walking and... I thought you would be asked. Is it normal not asking? What if I didn't want to? But you wanted to. Gent doesn't go for just any kind of girl. Maybe, If we had spent more time together I would have felt it more. I didn't think about these things with Lum. I just went for it. I just had the feeling, I didn't think it through. I learned a lot with him. I know myself better now. Where are we? Our poor mothers. They never got to know themselves. They didn't even know who they were going to marry. Imagine, my mom has only kissed my dad. I can't imagine living a life like that, alone, without a man. I have never seen my parents kissing. Disgusting! Why would you want to see such a thing? I like older guys better. That's how I like it. 35 and upper, They're more interesting. I wonder, what does he do being alone, in those roads. I guess we messed up with his plans. These chairs aren't that comfortable. But he goes slow around the curves, I think I should take over. You don't want to miss it. I see the posters are out. Gent got us the tickets. We'll talk. We'll have fun. It fits two fingers. It fits your whole hand. Did you got that? It's in the bedroom. In our bedroom. In the drawer, under the bed. Go get it. Will you get a certificate for the course? Some piece of paper, that proves you finished that school. Your teacher should know this. Do you think she feels threatened you might become her competition? This english-teaching has become a big deal. What do I know dad. Those who finished, have they got a certificate? I don't know, dad. What is this? I don't know, maybe. I don't know, maybe... What are you supposed to know? Miri! You keep wearing this, you have worn it out. Have you had your coffee? No, I haven't. Why? Why don't you go, pay Sevdije a visit? I don't want to see her. She keeps talking about her dead son. I can't, I just can't go there anymore. Why? Am I in your way? You haven't folded those clothes yet? It's all a mess. A mess. A mess. Nora. It's not a big deal if you miss a class. I said, it's not a big deal if you miss a class. Coming? Just come on. That's safer. So no one gets hurt. We were just about to break into that house. Do you remember? Yeah. He was saying his mom won't let him. I swear to God, yeah. When are you planning to return my clothes? I might wear those tomorrow. What do you mean tomorrow? You had them for two weeks. Hang on, hang on. Have you started swapping clothes like pussies. I gave him some clothes because he was going on a date. Now he wants to keep them. The motherfucker probably sold them. The girl got him broke. Still hanging around, guys? Still here? We're waiting for those tickets. But, it seems there are no tickets at all. I told you there's no tickets. What do you mean, no tickets? You'll be suckling on a single beer for two hours. Look who's talking. It seems like you were promising bullshit. Now, bring those on. I'll meet you outside. Do you like your eggs bald or hairy? Attaboy, attaboy. Where are you going, sweetie? Where are you heading to? Venera? The one with the tickets. We need those tickets. Haughty! So now what, we are strangers? Do your folks know where you're hanging out? Does your mom know how you treat the girls around here? Come on, get me a ticket. This kind of ticket you get with connec... You thought I was going to steal it? I'm not that kind of guy. Get me in somehow. Why would I? You're such a typical girl. - What do you know about girls? What do I know? Let me show you. Let me buy you a drink, and I'll show you what I know. Dad doesn't let me drink. So what, you drink milk at The Factory? I want to go. I am sorry, mom. Will you ask him for me? Please, mom. Ask who? We both know he won't listen to me. But he won't listen to me either. You know that. Why not? Because he's scared. That I can't look after myself. He's terrified someone spike my drink. He's scared mom, you know why. Now I get why he doesn't let you. What have you done? I have used your perfume. Oh, what a lovely smell. You came in again with dirty shoes. I can't believe I'm gonna see you there with Gent. But wait, maybe, you might not like the way we look together. I feel I've seen you already. Take that off. Can't wait for tomorrow night. The dark, a little drink, music, snuggling in some corner. Try this on. Don't give me that look. This one is great, but I've worn it too often. Your hair looks nice like this, don't tie it back. Really? Sure. I like it. What's up? People are saying things about you. What's this? Gossiping like women? You are sullying our name. - Stop it! You are the one who's sullying our names. Let the girl go. You're sullying our family name. Don't slam the door. I'm paying for it. Are you out of your mind?! You're driving me mad. Did he hurt you? The way he twisted your arm! Remove your earrings. It's the second time you're losing them. I didn't do it on purpose. It's not good to lose your matrimonial things. I know that. That's what they say. But, I can't go without them. I would look awful without them. They give me that little touch of elegance. Remove a bit from your eyes. Does my hair look good? Please ask him for me. I will. Grandma, does my hair look good? You look a little different. Dorina did it. It's good? Good, it's good. Isn't a bit much? No, i'ts good. Mom, what did he say? He said no to party. You're giving me the ticket? It's mine. We should go together. Dad won't say no, if I go with you. You have to ask him. What happened? You don't seem excited. Don't be this cheap. I'm just saying... don't run after him like this. He'll take you for an easy one. He's a grown up. He doesn't play silly games. So what, your dad thinks I'm a nice guy? Look, the guy will be waiting for me, if I don't go, I'll mess it up. Managing alright? How is it going? Nol, right on time to give me a hand. Hold it there for me. Pull it up. There is a party... You'll break something. Miri. You'll break my head. What's happening? Can't you see? Going mad. They're going mad. Venera. I want you here by 10 p.m. Not a minute later. I don't want to smell any alcohol. Are we clear? Go now. Leave it. I'll do it myself. Go on. You look beautiful. You'll catch a cold with that open back like this. So beautiful! You should have asked your dad yourself. We could have told him earlier. You know how he is. What's with the doe eyes? You want money? One, two... What's so funny? I am going to a party. I have never been to a party. What am I going to do with this? Buy a soda. What else do they drink there? Water. Take some spare underwear. Don't laugh. You never know. There might be a big queue at the toilet. I know you will get stuck. Are you hungry? That's enough. Let me have a look at you. Simple, beautiful. You'll catch a cold. Now let's split. Don't come looking for me. We'll meet outside, as we agreed. Can I keep the ticket? Sure, go on, brag to your friends. You mingle, find some new friends. You shouldn't have answered. I couldn't hear a thing, it was so loud. We have to stay a bit longer. We'll say there was no taxi... No way. - And you couldn't hear the phone, because the music was loud. No chance. Give me your phone. Here is the phone, now let's just go out of here. Half an hour. Someone called you many times. Dorina. Venera let's go, don't do this. Venera don't mess me around, let's go home. Come with me. Let's get some air. I'll be back. Go on. Why did you wait up? Do you think I don't know my way back home? You shall have come home earlier. Nol was here to check if you got home. You're lucky your dad is not here. You would have regretted it. Mom please! Let's leave it for tonight. Are you aware what time is it? Go to sleep, before he get's back. Why don't you go to sleep? Don't add to it. He won't come. But even if he does... I'm a grown up now. I didn't know you could dance. Leka, Miri. Come to mama, let's dance. Leka! How can you say no to a woman? What kind a man are you?! Go to bed. I've done nothing. It was only one night out. Why are you scared, then? Heh? I am not scared. I have done nothing to be afraid of. What do you think I've done? I'm not a coward, like her. Get out. What are you doing here? What am I doing here? Have a look inside. What? He knew it. He needs to be taught a lesson. He knew it. Who? Where's Dorina? Inside, with everyone. They're all gathered inside. My family as well. Idiots. Taking three hours to decide. Decide what? Obviously, they'll dump her on me. There is more coffee and sugar over here. Three more glasses of water. They are young and confused. We should be mature and sort this thing. Hopefully will succeed on this. These are beautiful. Would you like some cake? They didn't ask us when they started this, so, we won't ask them now. That's right... But there is nothing I can do. Who's this girl? I asked him three times. I am his uncle, he doesn't lie to me. I don't trust people hanging about in corners. Would you like a coffee? I will kill them. I will kill them both. You should sit here. I keep my words. Don't say that, one day you will be an uncle to their children. These jewelers are beautiful. Very beautiful! Dorina, what are you doing? Let's just leave. Nobody will notice, they've all gone mad. Just let them miss you a bit and you'll see. They will change. Don't be childish. Calm down. You've taken this so seriously. You always show up burdened. Is this marriage, or what? Ah, just ignore them. Let them yap away. As if it's up to them to decide about Lum and me. Gathering in vain. If it was a wedding, you would be the first one to know. You wouldn't come dressed like this, but with a dress better than mine. But you told me this was just an adventure, nothing else. That's exactly the point. I'm planning to carry on with my adventures. It's the same thing, now just more people know about it. At least Ron knows so he won't breathe down my neck anymore. One thing less to worry about, I won't have to hide in the bushes any longer. Does it look good? I need a little parting here. I don't like those women outside at all. Why do you care about those women? Will go out in a minute and wind them up a little. You turned out so beautiful. You really like it? Very much! Very much! I'm glad I didn't do your hair, it looks wonderful. Don't touch, you might ruin it. Now you'll have to love them. Especially my mother in law. Stop playing around. Wait, you aren't done. What's up? Fill me up with those. Show her respect. This is a cake for her. Now it's different. That's for sure. Now you'll know what is to be a mother. Aha, sure. I'll have five kids to show my appreciation. Good, your mother won't have to worry about you. Yes, one big worry less for her. Smile when give this to her. Can I have half of it myself? No, no. It's for your mother in law. Congratulation! Congratulation to you! It was an honor to have you here. May them have a happy life together. May you prosper. Hi! Is Nol here? Nol can't come out. I am making a pie, he can't come out without eating. Send my regards to your mom. Nol! I just wanted to make sure you got home last night. I was afraid your dad... What about my dad? You don't have nothing to worry about. I can look after myself. Couldn't you have found someone to have fun with instead of going to my place to make a fuss. Nol, don't go out without eating. - Can you just hang on a minute! Don't shout. You will be grounded. By the way, you desappered last night. How did it go with your guy? Why would you care how it went, when I don't. Why? This is not concern. Look, if you need to talk with someone, I am here. Why would I talk to you? Just because you helped me out once, got permission from my dad, now you think we're best friends? No. There is nothing to talk about. Listen, I know I have caused you trouble yesterday. But that wasn't my intention. I am sorry! I am going in, to sort out that pie before gets cold. I am hungry too. - Come in, then. But, take off your shoes out here. I'll deal with it. Nothing, just some family issues. Whatever issues she has with her family, she'll sort them out herself. Who are you to sort out such things? Go on, eat while it's still hot. Keep it real my daughter, he says. He, he is telling me what to do. When he hasn't got a clue himself. While, she calls me naive. Of course I am naive. They made me this way. Naive. They're teaching me about life, as if they know how to live. What are you doing? That's not edible anymore. Enough. I'll do what I damn please. Leave me alone. Get off. Take mine, you seem hungry. Take it. They think I am a little kid, like Leka and Miri. That I'll do as they please. That's what they think. That's how they think, they can't think any differently. They think I'm just down the street. Crying. All alone. Take it easy Venera, calm down. But I am not. I am not. Can you see where I am? I am right here, with you. I am here, not there. I am not. Don't tell me to calm down. Don't tell me nothing. Can you just say anything. Let's see where their daughter is now. Daughter. I could take care of her myself, but I thought is better I don't meddle with your family affairs. I knew she must be somewhere close. I am sorry about this. I feel I need to justify her behavior. Don't! I know what's your family like. Thank you. Don't you say thank you to me. This never happened. OK, it never happened. I poured the juice. Take off your jacket. Take a seat. Help yourselves. Mom, sit down. You already removed your... Come closer. I've made a spinach pie, as you like it. You shouldn't have to... I wanted to. Serve yourselves. I need some cleaning things cause, I spilled some juice in the bed. Don't worry about it sweetheart. I'll sort it out. Luan take some, while it's still hot. What a pride you have! Instead of you coming yourself, we have to come here to fetch you. What can you do my son, they're young and naive. But they'll learn. Yes, but at their age we were already providing for our families... Yes, we spoiled them a little. Mom! We did, but we need to tighten the knot. Mom, this is Nol's, You can finish it. We'll discuss these things at home. Here I come. Thank you very much, bless your hands. You've gone to too much trouble, we already had our lunch. Luan, take another piece. Here, let me bring this closer. Carry on, carry on, please. - Thank you. My darling, you've decapitated Luan's. What can you do, they're young. I brought these for boys, Nol has grown up. So, you might find a good use for them. Children grow, you'll never know how, or how fast. Look at his nails. Go get them cut you little brat. Don't call me a brat or I'll fuck you up... How can you say that in front of people? What's wrong with you? Hang on a second. How can you swear at your own mother? Sit, Luan, sit. Mom, get off my case. Mind your own children. - Didn't you hear him? I pity you my dear. Eat please, make yourselves at home. - Your hair looks lovely. Look at mine. This style suits you. - I hardly do anything to it. They look so soft. Have you ever dyed them? Very rearly. Nol, sit with the others. Mom, look after your own plate. Have you seen what happened? Look at the floods! Destroyed an entire village.
