He's Mr. Success. He's higher than high. He's sweeter than the sweetest cherry pie. He's king of the hill. He's top of the heap. He's Mr. Unique. He's not Mr. Sheep. From the shine on his shoe To the stars in his eye If he were a girl He'd be Princess Di. He's Mr. Success. He's higher than high. He's sweeter than the sweetest cherry pie. He's king of the hill. He's top of the heap. He's Mr. Unique. He's not Mr. Sheep. Come! Ah, Bottle! Enter ye! Enter ye! Thank you, Sir. Oh, and er... Thanks for sending your limo, Sir. Oh, pish! Sit ye. Sit ye! Cigar? Oh, come on, take ye! Take ye! Excellent! Well... Bottle... You had quite a day yesterday, didn't you? Not bad, Sir! Better than a hefty kick in the trousers! Oh, come on, boast ye! Boast ye! Due to your ability to ferret out great works of art in the country houses of some mad short-sighted old sock-knitters, you've made this firm 50 million pounds in clear profit. Well not quite, Sir... Not once we've paid the old ladies back their share. Oh, yes, now I wanted to talk to you about this, Bernard. Do you mind if I call you Bernard? No Sir, Bernie if you like. Yes... Well, the fact is, Bernard, I haven't quite mastered this refund bit. Elucidate ye! Well, Sir... I bought the paintings for a song. But I always said that if they turn out to be really valuable, we'd pay the owners back. Properly. Obviously not the full amount, because if we hadn't found them, the old ladies in question wouldn't have got anything. That's a good point, Bernard. That's a fully-fledged bastard of a good point. Yes, so now that we've sold them, I thought we'd return half the money to the lovely old birds. Oh, I see! Excellent! So you're suggesting we return 25 million pounds to the aforementioned old bats and keep a cool 25 mil for ourselves? That's the ticket, Sir. And I've got a list of some other old ladies who might have the odd Gainsborough tucked away in their attic. - Have you? - Yes. Good. Good. I like the cut of your jib, Bottle! I've been watching you... And I've been thinking about your future with the firm. Thank you, Sir. I'm already assessing the prospects for the staff. And so naturally, my thoughts have turned to you. - Have they, Sir? - Yes, they have, Bernard. And I've made a big decision. And what's that, Sir? You're fired. - Sorry, Sir? - Fired, Bottle! I sack ye! I want you and your philanthropic little arse out of this building, pronto, or I'll have you arrested for loitering. And probably throw a charge of sexual harassment into the bargain. - I'm not with you, Sir. - Not any more, you're not. And if I have anything to do with it, you won't be with anyone else, either. Miss Temple, take a letter. I want it circulated to everyone in the art world, including Gilbert and George... Dearest darlings... I write to warn you against employing a Mr B. Bottle, whom I've just caught attempting to steal... Notice steal there, Bottle. 25 million pounds from me. Don't even interview him. He has just left my office, and suddenly my gold fountain pen has disappeared. I'm therefore yours in crayon. P.S. I've just dropped in on my secretary, who looks distinctly harassed, sexually. I think you get the message, Bottle. Yes, Sir. Not very nice message. No... it's a true-blue stinker. Farewell, Bottle. And never darken our doors again. This is a profit-making organisation, not Help the Aged. Wait a minute...! This isn't just a lovely joke before you promote me to Head of Department, is it Sir? - No. - Oh. Right... Bugger ye off! He's Mr. No Good. He's Mr. Depressed. His butt has been kicked. His life's in a mess. He's Mr. Despair. He's Mr. Bad Luck. (?**) Home early, Sir! Did they give you the day off as a reward? Well, no actually, Kepple, they fired me. - Oh no, Sir! - Oh yes, Kepple. I make them a fortune and they bloomin' well kick me out. That's terrible, Sir. Exactly the same thing happened to me. I used to work for this big oil firm. I discovered the formula for a new kind of petrol. Cleaner. Cheaper. More efficient. Kinder to the environment. I handed it in. The next day they fired me. I never saw a penny of the profits. - Is that true, Kepple? - No Sir, it's not. - Not true? - No, Sir, it's a total lie, Sir. I thought it might cheer you up. That's very decent of you, Kepple. Hello, I'm sorry I'm not in my office at the moment. Please leave a message, I'll get back to you. Bye. - Hello...? - Hi Kev, Bernie here. Oh, hi... look erm... things are a bit complicated right now, OK? God, you are like a rabbit... do you never stop? Yeah, I know. Er look, erm, I've got some pretty grizzly news. Could do with a shoulder to cry on. I just tried Judy, but she's out. You don't know where she is, do you? Um... well... uh... - It's Bernie! - What? - I do, actually. - Oh, great! Hello, Bernard. Oh... hi, sweetheart! Oh look, you're not gonna believe what's gone and... ...bloomin' well happened... I reported into work this morning, and... Wait a minute...! What in the banana tree are you doing there? Well, you had to find out some time. It might as well be now. Look, the thing is... Kevin and I are deeply in love. Yeah, sorry about this, mate. And we thought... Seeing as you're getting so successful and everything, these days... Yeah, congratulations. Great news. Perhaps you wouldn't mind so much us telling you. Look... wait a minute... Let me get this straight... you mean... - You and Kevin... - Yes. That's right. Thanks for introducing us, mate! Oh, and Bernie, by the way... Just as a matter of interest... You know you used to wonder why it was that Kevin got so many girlfriends? Yes, why does he get so many girlfriends? Because he's so good in bed. Oh, great. - Bernie... - Yes? I was thinking, darling... Do you mind if I just come round? Oh, no, please do... I'm sure there's nothing a good chat can't sort out. I want to get my stuff... I'm really eager to get settled in here. Oh, good. Excellent news. It'll be lonely this Christmas... Without you to hold It'll be lonely this Christmas Lonely and cold It'll be cold, so cold, without you to hold This Christmas Each time I remember the day you went away And how I wouldn't listen to the things you had to say I just break down as I look around And the only things I see Are emptiness and loneliness And an unlit Christmas tree It'll be cold, so cold, without you to hold This Christmas You remember last year when you and I were here. We never thought there'd be an end... And I remember looking at you, darling And I remember thinking that Christmas must have been made for us 'cause, darling, this is the time of year that you really, you really need love When it means so very, very much It'll be lonely... So, it'll be lonely this Christmas Without you to hold What happened? Seems to have been some sort of explosion, Sir. Good Lord! How am I? Do I still look vaguely human? Or have I turned into Julian Lloyd Webber? No, you're fine, Mr Bottle. Just a little bang on your head. And one severely-singed testicle. You'll be out of here in the morning. Don't you worry, Sir. I had a friend who had both his legs blown off, and he was up and walkin' around in a fortnight. - Is that true, Kepple? - Not exactly, Sir. Right! Now you just rest, and tomorrow your friend can pick you up. Thank you, sister. Thanks for sticking with me last night, Kepple. That's alright, Sir. They didn't nickname me Sticky Kepple for nothing. - Your nickname was Sticky Kepple? - No Sir, it wasn't. They don't go in for nicknames in the Navy. I didn't know you were in the Navy, Kepple. I wasn't, Sir... Can't stand the sea. However, be that as it may... If you ever need anything, you just call and I'll be up there faster than a poker up a pervert. - Indeed. Anchors aweigh, Sir! Oh, my God, you're a maniac! Kepple! Kepple! Save me! There's nothing left to steal. My bloomin' girlfriend's gone and nicked the lot. Oh lawks a-mercy... I wish you could speak English. I can! - You can? - Yes! Your wish is my command. Now, beware, oh short one... You smell of peppermint, and it is time to die! Sorry? - You smell of peppermint. - No, no, before that. Beware, oh short one! No, no, no... further back... Right at the top. Unfortunately, your wish is my command. Okay... then I wish you'd stop trying to kill me. Damn! Gotcha! Okay, what's the story, Abdul? How the bloomin' hell did you get into my house? I was in the bloomin' lamp! Yes, very likely! And how do large transvestites get inside lamps these days? A bloomin' wizard did it, and made me into a bloomin' genie, without so much as a bloomin' by-your-leave! I'm dealing with a madman! Don't move! This is one of these really scary Bulgarian poison-tipped umbrellas. One prick is fatal! I'm going to ring the police. Damn! I wish there was a phone in here. Have you just injected LSD into my bottom? Look... I've explained this... I'm a genie... Oh, come off it, mate...! Who's ever heard of genies? Well, you, obviously! Look, we're like ghosts and dragons and unicorns. You don't think they exist until you meet them. So, all I have to do is wish? As far as I know, the training for this stupid job is practically non-existent. Well you'd better get your next alibi ready pretty quickly, because I wish this chair was Melvyn Bragg. I wish it wasn't. Sorry, Melvyn. Lord in heaven! You mean... So... for instance... If I were to wish my pockets were full of money... Oh my God! Oh Kevin, I'm worried about Bernard. Yeah, I'm worried about him too, baby. This guy's my best friend. I'd do anything not to hurt him. I know. I know. But you know, baby... Bernard's always lived in a bit of a dream world. I mean, I love this man... But he looked like a turnip... And if what you say is true, he had all the sexual skills of a small Dutch cheese. Well, a medium-size Dutch cheese. And yet he still thought he could go out with a goddess like you. Fact is that sometime, Bernard's got to come down to earth. Got to realise that it's a tough dog-stabs-dog-in-the-back and then eats-dog world. We're doing him a favour. The sooner Bernie faces up to reality, the better. So, all I have to do is wish? As far as I know. Wish me mum could see me now. Hello, Bernard! Are you feeding yourself properly? And what a condition this place is in! On second thoughts, no offense mum, I wish she couldn't. I have to be very careful... Don't I? Yes. Say the words "I wish" with the caution you would normally reserve for "Please castrate me." Yes. It's going to be brilliant! But I think we should sort out just exactly how it's going to work. Things must have changed somewhat, since you were last... out. I bet! So, tell me... - How's old Caesar? - Caesar? Yes, the emperor. Ah well, you see, he's dead. - No! What happened? - He was stabbed. In the Capitol. God, so who's in charge now? Brutus? No, he's dead, too. Wow! A real massacre! Yeah. Look, um... There's something I think I ought to explain. You see, you've obviously been inside the lamp slightly longer than you think. How long? Well, give or take a day or two, 2,000 years. No...! 2,000 years?! Most of my friends will be dead. All, I think's a more likely guess. Yes... my girlfriend... My mother... my father... my sister... The kittens! Wow! I'm very sorry. No, no, I'm the one who should be sorry. The last thing you need around the place is a gloomy genie. Go ahead, make some wishes. Go ahead! - I'll be fine. - Oh no, for heaven's sake. I know how you feel. My life hasn't been too rosy recently, either. Getting teased a lot about the stupid haircut? No! Everything else has been pretty crappy. I just got sacked, and then found out that my fianc?e was sleeping with my best friend. Do you wish me to kill them? Erm no, that's not really the way we do things any longer. Well, how do you deal with your enemies these days? Well... we kind of don't see them. You know, sort of spurn them. Spurn them! Then the odd nasty look, kind of ... er... sarcastic remark... And then we kind of encourage our other friends, you know, not to see them and to be a bit sarcastic too. That's it?! So it's not all progress then? Still, don't get too depressed. Look on the bright side. Your fianc?e is buried in the arms of your best friend. Mine is buried in an artichoke patch in Jerusalem. Good point. I know! I wish you weren't so depressed. No, it doesn't work. You can't change people's feelings with wishes. Oh dear. Then we're in trouble, aren't we? Well, what say as to we have a bite to eat? How does a hamburger grab you? A what? Oh well, it's er... two all-beef patties... special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions in a sesame seed bun. - I might take out the pickles. - You wouldn't be the first. I wish we had two Big Macs! Have a try. Erm, take it out of the box first. Everybody dead. All I ever wanted was to get out of the lamp. Now... I almost wish I hadn't. On the other hand! Bite my beetroot! That is fantastic! You get the right price, you could sell hundreds of these. Well, they do sell quite a few. There's a difference about this people will enjoy. Even the pickles are nice! Something wrong? No, something unbelievably right! My ears want to mate with this music and have its children. Tell me, who is this guy, Bernie? It's a chap called Mozart. This is my kind of guy! Incredible! This new music is great! That isn't modern music. This is. That is fantastic! Make it with a mango! Alright! - Tell me Bernie, what colour is this guy? - Black. Thought so. Ah, girls! Girls! Enter ye... Enter ye! Sit ye! Sit ye! Now, as you probably heard... Mr Bottle left us yesterday. And I've been worrying about it. Do either of you think I was a little harsh on him? Well, Sir. I think perhaps you might have given him a warning. Good... good...! You're fired. I want you out of here in two minutes. You disastrously faded old crone. Exit ye! Exit ye! 35 years! Now, Miss Purse... No pressure. Just old friends talking. Just bosom buddies bantering. Any opinions on the Bottle scenario? Inspired move, Sir! Thank you. But I have, as I said, been worrying. Because Bottle had a list of some other priceless paintings. And I want it back. I want you to search his office, and if it isn't there, we'll just have to go where he lives, and steal it. I shall start looking immediately, Sir. Good. No pressure, you understand. No pressure. Although for the moment, I'll just put your Christmas bonus on hold. Yes, Sir. Thank ye. Thank ye. Oh, by the way, Miss Purse... I was joking about the Christmas bonus. Oh, thank you, Sir! You weren't getting one anyway. Who do you think I am? Felicity Kendal? If you want money, work for it. I did. And I won't let any little creep take it from me. So I really can have absolutely anything?! Yep! Okay. Well, for a start, let's brighten up this flat a bit. Unbelievable! Okay, I wish I had the Mona Lisa on that wall. Oh, my God! Mmm, cute chick! Bit of a smudge around the mouth though. Here, let me sort that out. No, best leave it I think. Unbelievable. Fantastic. Bit of a tease though, eh? I could just stay here all night, just staring at her. Oh look, sorry, I'm not being a very good host, am I? You'd probably like to take a look round. - Good idea! - Yes. Things have changed quite a lot in the last 1,000 years. I'll say! For instance in my day, this would've made an attractive hat. Look, I'll take you round town if you like. Excellent. Damn! The only thing is that, after all that business at work, I don't actually have any transport. Hot spots, here we come! I think it's fair to say that the people from Allied Carpets would be genuinely surprised by this. The real skill, of course, is in the landing. And I think I need a little more practice. Look er, before we go any further, I think we should do something about the clothes. What? You cannot get hotter than this! Chicks see this stuff and die! Yes, I'm sure. I just wish we had the modern equivalent. Yes, now that's a lot better! I feel fantastic! And I look it, too! You are cute! Jean Genie, screams and he bawls Jean Genie, let yourself go. I must say I don't normally come here, it's got rather dirty recently. You call this dirty? Where I come from, you go out shopping, you come back with leprosy. People used to urinate on their vegetables to give it that early-morning dewy fresh look. This is the cleanest place I've ever seen in my whole life! Let's boogie! Ah, delicious! I'm glad dog meat is still popular. Get him, Arnie! He's an alien and he's killing absolutely everyone! Get him! Hasta la vista, baby! That was unbelievable! Those people were huge! Tell me, where do they all live? Er, most of them are in Los Angeles. That's the place for me! That woman's breasts were 60 feet high! Which flavour would you like? That one! This is great, Bernie. In my country there is only one type of dessert, and it tastes disgusting! Oh my God! Take out my eyeballs and fry them in ginger...! That is unbelievable! Here, hold that. Hey, everybody, come in here! This stuff is brilliant! It's really cold and it tastes completely of strawberries. It's wonderful! People have tried it and it's nothing special to them anymore. You're crazy! I think I'll try a few more flavours. Bernie, it's great to be here! Let's go! The Daily Standard. Daily Standard. Read all about it. Daily Standard. How do you feel? A bit sick actually, but it's OK. I haven't had a stomach ache for 2,000 years. It's like the return of an old friend. Mr Beardy again! Is he like emperor here, or something? No, it's Christmas, which is a kind of holiday we have at this time of year. And the chap in the beard goes round with his flying reindeer. And then comes down chimneys and gives children presents. - Wow! - Yeah. And what do you want for Christmas? A car, and a train, and three Nintendos. Yes, and a pencil's also nice, isn't it, eh? Yes. Except, he doesn't, in fact, come down chimneys. And it isn't actually him who gives the presents. Do the reindeer really fly? I think not. Mr Beardy is beginning to sound a bit like a non-event. Yeah. Christmas isn't what it used to be. Santa smelled funny. Now it's just the time that kids learn to live with disappointments. Speaking of which, I'm a bit disappointed that we haven't eaten anything for a while. It's been a good ... oh, 20 minutes since my last full meal. Your wish is my command. Well, I've sucked on some pretty wonderful things, Bernie, but that takes the biscuit! You and I are going to be a wonderful partnership. I can see it now. But, you know, there's more to me than fantastic pants. I'm going to find you a woman! - Oh no! - Starting right now! Okay, now those two over there are definitely out. Bit wrinkly. And she...! She's pretty cute. Okay, she's a bit older than you, but if she shakes her booty the way she shakes her milk... On the other hand. Oh no, please! Ah, you like the look of her? - Well... - Leave it to me. I'm pretty experienced at this kind of thing. Oh, thank God it's near closing time. We're runnin' out of pencils. Good evening. Oh, hello! - Great hair! - Thank you very much. Myself and my friend, with the very unfortunate hair, but he's very fertile, and has a large inheritance, couldn't help noticing the splendid work you were doing with the children. Oh, thanks. Ay tell (**), actually. Santa drinks like a fish, and these hot pants were tailor-made for Bonnie Langford. Indeed! Would you care to join us for a shake of milk? Or perhaps you'd like me to organise something more formal where your parents were involved? No, I'll just have a cup of coffee, and fly. What a coincidence, We're flying, too! - Is that right?! - Yes! Could you hang on for just one second, please? - Certainly. - Thank you. Actually, you'd better make that two coffees. Santa keeps on dozing off over the children. It's going very well. She says her pants are hot. She wants your body and she wants it now! - She does not! - She does! A little more negotiation, and the match will be made. Depending of course on proof of child-bearing capability. - Oh God! So is that your flying carpet, then? Yes, it is. Would you fancy a ride? Oh no...! The reindeer can get very jealous if I use alternative means of transport. Very amusing! Now, down to business. Obviously the question of the dowry rears its ugly head. I'm sorry, he's not from round here. No, I sort of guessed that. I think your hair's quite nice. 'Bye. It's a dead cert! I can see it now. The loving relatives, the priest. The staggeringly attractive best man. The shagged-out bridesmaids. No. Somebody like that would never fancy me. Course she would. All we have to do is... sex you up a bit. Like how? Well, if you don?t mind my saying so, Bernie, you are a bit neat. What you need is that rough look. You need to be giving that sexy unshaven thing. You mean scruffy? Scruffy can be sexy. Okay... I wish I looked like Bob Geldof. Oh my God! What do you think... a certain rugged charm? Might be one way of putting it... A total blooming mess might be another. Don't be so damn cheeky! Is that Mick Jagger? Oh, Bernie... I liked you the way you were. Let's have a look... Bloody hell, you're right! This voice is gettin' on my nerves as well. I wish I was me again. Mr Cute! Ah, that's my boy! Welcome back! What's next? Well er, I thought we could go back home and check out Mona. Brilliant idea! Although, I have an even more brilliant one. Why don't you go home and check out Mona, and I'll go and check out those 60-foot breasts again. Are you sure you'll be alright without me? Of course. More importantly, will you be alright without me? Oh yes. I've cheered up distinctly. Good! Happy days are here again. Sorry! We'll take that, if you don't mind. We don't want anyone else brutally assaulted, do we? Send for some assistance, Alan. Can I ask you why you're here? Is there something wrong? Yes, well, as a matter of fact, there is, Mr Bottle. You're about to be accused of... Grand theft. Hello, Sir. What are you doing here? Well, I just thought I'd pop round for a little Christmas drinkie with my old pal, Bernie. And I discover this list of priceless paintings, that you stole from our office. Then, I happened to inspect the walls, and discovered this dear lady. Do you recognise that picture, Mr Bottle? Oh, yes, of course I do, it... It was stolen from the Louvre, earlier today. It is a magnificent work, isn't it? No matter how much time passes, one can never quite get over the wonder of that smile. And somehow, it seems to have made its way here. Yes, well I think I can explain that. - Yes? - Yes? Yes? Yes. Well, you see the thing is, there's this lamp... Er well, on second thoughts, I think I can't explain it. I wish it wasn't here. I wish it wasn't here. Good shot, Robin! I wish it wasn't here. Well, I'm afraid it is. You're coming with us. Excuse me if I don't keep you company, gentlemen. Christmas bash at Number 10. Don't want to keep poor Johnny and dear Norma waiting. As for you... What can I say, Bottle? God rest ye merry. God rest ye. I don't mean to be cruel Don't mean to be rude. But Mr. Success is Mr. Totally Screwed Life can be tough Life can be unfair He's off to meet Mr. Electric Chair. Don't you worry, Sir... I was once arrested for murder, and sentenced to death by hanging. - Is that right, Kepple? - Oh, yes... We tried to appeal, but the High Court threw it out. I was caught red-handed, you see, Sir. Smoking gun in the victim's mouth. So there I was. Noose round the neck. Padre in attendance. Mother in tears. No hope in sight. And? Oh, it all turned out alright in the end, Sir. - Just a few of the lads, larkin' about. - Thank you, Kepple. Pigs! Tie. Name? Bottle, Bernard. - Crime? - Grand theft. And murder of a police officer. - Really? - Yes! I wonder if he's guilty. It's a tricky one... The Mona Lisa hanging in his front room. And three witnesses who saw him clubbing his victim to death. Do you know something, Alan, you're right. It's one of those ones juries really agonise over. All said and done, not a good day. You can make one phone call. Might I recommend a priest? Either that or a publisher. I believe tales from Death Row are always big sellers. Please be in. Please be in. And the answer to all my dreams You're my... Josephus? Josephus? Hello? We're dealing with highly-trained villains, Sir. The first five times, there's no reply. Then twice, the phone's picked up, but put down straight away. Textbook stuff. Brilliant work, Parker. Obviously the accomplice has returned to the flat. We've got them by the short and painfuls. - They're doomed, Parker. - Doomed, Sir! Doomed! He said "Well, when we have done, ours is 3 pound". I'll come back when you have none. "Fair enough, I'll come back when you have none." No gags like the old gags, eh Frankie? Hi guys, can I help? We'd like you to come with us, sunshine! Certainly. You know, he is really tiny but very funny. Love the uniform, kinky! Spread 'em! Mmm, I was right, very kinky! Don't try and be funny. Mmm, tasty! Thank you for the bracelet, but do you think it goes with the pendant? Name? May I just say before I answer that that is an absolutely splendid beard. Although it might be more useful if you wore it on top of your head. Just ignore him, he's a smart-arse. - Name? - Josephus. Get in there. Smart-arse! Anything you say, smart-uniform. Bernie, my oldest, dearest pal, where have you been? - Here. Funny choice. Still it does have a certain kooky charm. Colourful toilet... And those guys out there are fun. It's not a choice. We are in real trouble. I could spend the rest of my life in prison, you know. It's no joke. It's no joke? Not amusing? What happened? God, it's too depressing to explain. Even with a genie, I'm a disaster. When I got home last night, they arrested me for nicking the Mona Lisa. The only girlfriend I'll ever get now will be 6 foot 2, with a full beard. - Sounds OK to me. - Oh come on, be serious! I killed a policeman! God, poor bastard! And his family. I mean, he leaves home at 9am in a Panda car, comes back home at midnight in a plastic bag, murdered by an ex art-dealer, with a scimitar. Oh dear! If only I'd been there. I wish you had. - You can do that? - For you... anything! Ah, good evening, officers! Good evening, Mr Bottle. Sorry, is there something wrong? Yes, well, as a matter of fact there is, Mr Bottle. You're just about to be accused of... Grand theft. Hello, Sir. What are you doing here? Well, I just thought I'd pop around and have a little drinkie with my old pal, Bernie. And I discover this list of priceless paintings, that you stole from our office. Then I happened to inspect the walls, and discovered this dear lady. Oh yes, Kylie, my absolute favourite. Wait a minute. What's going on here? You told us it was the Mona Lisa. Well yes, it was the Mona Lisa! I like this chick better. Yes, it's a fabulous work. And no matter how much time passes, one still can't quite get over the wonder of that smile. Hello? Oh, so that's what it's for! What?! Apparently the painting has been returned. What do you mean returned? It's back in the Louvre. I think we owe these people an apology. Mr Bottle, and er, Mr er... Smart-arse. Yes... um... Sorry to disturb you, Mr Smart-arse... We'll be off, now. Thank God for that! I can't think of anything we'd like to do less than hang around with scum like you. Come again, sunshine? Yes, you are obviously a slimebag and living proof that man is directly related to the slug. And your face looked familiar when I first saw it, and now I remember seeing something very similar whilst washing down the hindquarters of a camel. You what?! And you are a very large turd in a horrible pink shirt. I beg your bloody pardon? Do you wish I'd never said any of that? Yes, I do. Well, goodbye gentlemen. It's nice to meet you. You're an honour to the Force, the pair of you! Thanks guv'nor! - And er, merry Christmas! - Happy new year! 'Bye! Oh, and I'm so thrilled you're still alive. I'm so pleased I didn't kill you! Yes. Right. Goodbye, Sir. Lovely shirt. Although I do wish you hadn't taken that list. But do pop round for a drink anytime... And er, give the PM one for me! Certainly. Thank you, Bottle. Thank you, Sir. Bye, flower. - My friend! - I suspect it's going to be a very merry Christmas! Are you hanging up your stocking on the wall? - Have you seen my toothbrush? - No. It's the time that every Santa has a ball Does he ride a red-nosed reindeer? I put this in the water, yes? Yes, not too much though. How much is too much? Well er, just put in a drop. So here it is, Merry Christmas Everybody's having fun I think it's too late. Look to the future now It's only just begun Are you waiting for the family to arrive? Are you sure you've got the room to spare inside? Does your Granny always tell you That the old songs are the best? And she's up and rock'n'rolling with the rest. So here it is, Merry Christmas Everybody's having fun Look to the future now It's only just begun. What will your Daddy do when he sees your Mother kissing Santa Claus? So here it is, Merry Christmas Everybody's having fun Look to the future now It's only just begun. - Ready? - Yeah. Let's rock! Peace on Earth and mercy mild God and sinners reconciled So, tell me about this Christmas thing. Well, it's become a very big commercial thing in recent times. Oh, I like commercial... I like commercials! "Fly Fishing" by J.R.Hartley. Yeah, but originally it was supposed to celebrate the birth of this chap called Jesus Christ. Who was born, well, about 2,000 years ago. - Jesus you say? - Yeah. But I knew this guy! You did not! I did! What did he do to get so famous? Well he turned out to be the Son of God. No! I thought he was kidding! No... true blue. Dammit! I knew there was something special about him from the moment I first met him. You met him? Of course. He helped out with the wine at my brother's wedding. Wait a minute, so... You were at the wedding at Cana? Well, I think so, though by the end of it, I was so completely legless, I can't be sure. This is so bizarre. I told him, "You could be a big money-spinner." But oh no, Goodie Two-shoes was having none of it. One night, we're on the boat... He walks on water! You were there? One day, 5,000 people came out to see him talk. And they didn't have any food. So, guess what he did? He produced loaves and fishes for them all. Yes. I said "Let's open a restaurant right now." We'll call it Something Fishy. But he didn't like the name. Anyway, happy birthday, Big J. A crap businessman, but a great human being. - To Big J! - Big J! So tell me, what happened to him? Well, he was crucified. No. You're kidding! Afraid not. Wow... There's no need for that! This was a wonderful guy. But being the son of God, he came back to life again. Oh great! Is he still alive? Not really, no. You see, he rose up into heaven. Lucky for you. Jesus was not keen on people making money out of religion. One day I was in the temple when they tried to turn it into a supermarket. Jesus went in there, and kicked arse! Like Arnold Schwarzenegger? Yes, but with smaller pectorals. Yes, well unfortunately it seems the big money people are taking over. Hmmm, well it's time for the no-money people to strike back. Let's make some wishes for Big J, his way! You're the boss... Let's do it! When the snowman brings the snow Well he just might like to know He's put a great big smile on somebody's face Thank you! Do you have a ticket? Look, Mummy! Look, Mummy... Look what I've got! Mummy, look! Merry Christmas! Oh, you too! What about you? D'you fancy him as well? Is that for me? So, what did you wish for? What was that? Don't worry, Bernie, it was just a warning. Now, what about you? What would you like for Christmas? Well, I have had one or two little thoughts. Ah. Good! Littlewoods have announced their largest-ever pools winner. Mr Frank Kepple, a doorman in Wandsworth, has won 3 million pounds. Today he said it won't change his life. No, you see, this is in fact the 4th time I have won the 3 million pound prize. No, I don't believe it! Oh dear, the lift has stuck. It's never done that before. And in Battersea tonight, the cracking of a major drugs ring. Kevin Bell, the City financier, was found with 30 pounds of marijuana, stored under his bed. Look, it's a plant! I think you'll find it's 100 plants, actually. More like 1,000. Well, if it was all there, why didn't he ever give me any? Tragic! - Really terrible. - And they look such a nice couple. And finally, a charming Christmas story. This evening the Queen received an unexpected letter at Buckingham Palace. It included a cheque from arts dealer Charles Pinkworth, donating 100 million pounds to Christmas charities. We went down to the house, where a grateful crowd has gathered. For he's a jolly good fellow... And so say all of us! Mr Charles Pinkworth? Yes? What made you make this extraordinarily generous gesture? What gesture? 100 million pounds! The 100 million pound cheque to the Queen. Repeat ye? Buckingham Palace apparently has received a 100 million pound charity cheque from you. You've become a national hero, because of your generosity. Have I? A knighthood is surely on its way. I wish it wasn't on its way. - Is it? - No, no, apparently it's not. But please tell the nation what your motives were. 50 million people want to know. Yes. Well... Christmas is very much a time for giving. And I thought it was about time that somebody from the commercial sector put their money where their mouth was, and gave their entire fortune away to the needy. A fortune for which he has worked for 25 bloody years. For he's a jolly good fellow... And so say all of us! And what a wonderful story that is. Now, the Christmas weather. And for the first time in 15 years, deep, deep snow. From all of us here, goodbye, and a very merry Christmas. Well, that's it then, isn't it? Er, not quite. Excuse me please. Thank you. Ah... snack time! A little light refreshment! So, what do you want for Christmas, Josephus? Oh, new pair of pants... Whatever you like. Chicken tandoori flavoured toothpaste. No, come on... you know... When we first met, I was the most wretched bloke in the whole world. Except maybe for that guy who's married to Esther Rantzen. Maybe him. But now, you know... I'm as happy as Michelle Pfeiffer's underpants. And I'd like to give you something fab for Christmas. Well... There is something, Bernard. But it's blooming hard to ask for. Well, just you ask away. Whatever it is, it's yours. I want to go home. See, I like it here. I love little Frank Carson and I love big Kevin Costner. I love post-it notes, I love you. But I miss things... I miss my family. I don't have anybody to write Christmas cards to. I miss my fianc?e. I miss Egbert and Pee Wee. The kittens? The kittens. And no one stir-fries rabbit droppings like my mum does. Yes, well... People rather seem to have lost the knack, there. Oh dear. Yes, well... Surely. And there's another thing... If I could just get the recipe for these 100 percent beef patty things... - You could make a bob or two. - Exactly! And if I could memorise the songs by Mr Barry White, I could snog every babe in a yashmak from Mount Hebron to the Red Sea. We got it together, didn't we? Sure, sure. I understand. You should go. But first, there's one thing I'd like to try. Don't be nervous, Bernie! Don't worry, I've got you. That's where I was born. That was a fabulous tour, Bernie. Thank you! Rome wasn't quite as big as I expected it to be. But New York? Wow! That was fantastic! Yeah, the Americans have put a lot of work into it. Tell me... why are there no tall buildings in Beirut? That's a long story. Take me home, James! I can't believe you wished for this stuff. It's bloody freezing! Well, here we go... Goodbye! You great big funky dude. I'd like to say I'd call, but the phone system in 1st century Palestine is absolute crap. Okay. Are you sure you've got enough stuff? I think so. Look... ...if you bump into Jesus, tell him to keep an eye on Judas. He's a nasty piece of work. Okay. I have a present for you. Take it from me. It may not look like much, but it may come in handy, when I leave. Okay, fine, thanks. And when you're looking through that old bibble... - Bible. - Whatever. And it says... "And the multitude gathered..." Remember, one of them is a close personal friend of yours. Oh, this is getting far too emotional, I wish you'd just go. No, wait, I wish... I wish... Okay. Thank you. Merry Christmas! So what do you want for Christmas? He's Mr. Success. He's higher than high. He's sweeter than the sweetest cherry pie. He's king of the hill. He's top of the heap. He's Mr. Unique. He's not Mr. Sheep. From the shine on his shoe To the stars in his eye If he were a girl He'd be Princess Di. He's Mr. Success. He's higher than high. He's sweeter than the sweetest cherry pie. He's king of the hill. He's top of the heap. He's Mr. Unique. He's not Mr. Sheep.
