OK, look, I was following you guys. I didn't mean any harm, but it's out there, it's gonna get me! What's out there? I don't know. It was... it was little and brown and low to the ground. It's probably just a gopher in heat. It wasn't any gopher! Where's that girl, anyway? She's waiting back there for me, you idiot! - [ Scrabbling sounds ] - Hear that? - [ Wind whistling ] - Nah, it's only the wind. You better go get her before it gets her.

OK, I believe you. Jesus! What's going on up there? Well, there's something I didn't tell you. I was spying on Tommy's funeral from the groves. After everybody left, that tall man picked up Tommy's coffin all by himself, - put it in the hearse, and drove off. - You're crazy. I helped carry that sucker myself, it must have weighed over 500 pounds. [ Sighs ] I can't figure this thing out. But I do know one thing. Something weird is going on up there. We're going for the sheriff. Go get your... evidence. All right! That's funny. [ Screeching ] [ Buzzing ] Jody! Jody! [ Buzzing continues ] The garbage disposal. Come on. [ Buzzing ] You ready? Go! [ Grinding ] Would you look at that. [ Knock on door ] Hi, guys. Thought I'd come and see what was going on before the kids got outta summer school. Mike, you wanna ride along with me today? It's pretty warm outside and the ice cream'll be flying fast and furious. Remember how good you were at crowd control last time... Hey, what's going on here? [ Buzzing ] Ah! - Ah! - [ Buzzing ] [ Grinding ] What the hell is going on? Here, you keep that. Now remember, you don't aim a gun at a man unless you intend to shoot him, and you don't shoot a man unless you intend to kill him. No warning shots. Hey, you listening to me? - Yeah. - No warning shots. Warning shots are bullshit. You shoot to kill, or you don't shoot at all. Now, you'll be safe here. Just lock all the doors and windows. And don't follow me. You sure you're gonna be OK with that? I'm just gonna go up there and take a look around. Nobody's gonna see me. But heck, a Colt army issue will put a man down, and keep him there. Remember that broken basement window around by the side... and be careful. [ Growling ] [ Grunts Growling ] [ Growling ] Ah! - [ Gunshot ] - [ Growling ] [ Growling continues ] [ Car approaching ] [ Breathing heavily ] All right, who's in there? Mike? - Mike. - Damn door latch! Get in. [ Tyres squeal ] - Uh-oh, here it comes! - There's nobody driving that mother! Pump's in the back seat. OK, slow down and let him ride right up on our ass. There was nobody... there was nobody driving! I'm gonna get that bastard! Oh, Jesus! All right, speed up. I'm gonna put a few in the engine. OK. Holy shit! Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo! It's one of those dwarfs. He went right through it! Tommy! Reggie... we got one of 'em. Uh, in Colton, in the groves. All right. Uh, Reg? Bring your truck. Jesus! You didn't tell me the dwarf was Tommy. Hell, we buried him on Monday and look what they did to him. He's only three feet long, he must still weigh 200 pounds. What's all this yellow shit coming out of his head? Careful, get him in there. - Better padlock it. - Yeah. Hey, this guy's not gonna leak all over my ice cream, is he? Nah. I'll see you back at the house. Right. Hey, you boys back again? Jesus Christ, Myrtle, you almost gave me a coronary! But I just can't figure out why. Why they're taking these bodies and crushing 'em down to half size. Crushing 'em! What about Mom and Dad? They're up there too. Hey, just forget about that. OK... l see it, I see it all now. What we gotta do is snag that tall dude and stomp the shit out of him, and we'll find out what the hell is going on up there. We'll lay that sucker flat and drive a stake right through his god-damn heart! You gotta be shitting me, man, that mother's strong! Hey, hold on. First thing is, I want Mike outta here. Reg, you take him over to Sally's, the antique store. He'll be safe there. Then hustle on back. And Mike, no arguments Jody sure sounded strange on the phone. I hope he's feeling OK. Sally, did you see these new settings? Oh, these are nice. You know, I think I'm gonna lock up. Michael, when you get sleepy, I've got a bed made up for you in back. You have to take me home. - But why? - No questions. You must take me home. [ I Van chimes play Three Blind Mice ] [ Thumping ] [ Growling ] [ Creaking ] [ Wailing ] [ Footsteps echoing ] Aargh! Oh, my God, pull over. [ Mike ] Stay in the car and don't get out. I'll be right back. [ Woman ] Michael, wait a minute. Is that Reggie's truck? [ Dripping ] Let's get outta here, quick! Michael, what is going on? Just get me home. [ Rattling ] What the hell's that? Oh, shit! [ Rattling continues ] Get outta here! [ Rattling ] Don't open it! - No! - [ Screams ] [ Mike grunts ] [ Screaming continues ] Oh! [ Glass shatters ] [ Screaming ] Hey, man. They got Sally and Susie. What? Up at Morningside. And Reggie too. You better get on up to your room. - I'm going with you! - Nope. I'm not letting you go by yourself. Let me go, God damn it! Son of a bitch, you're not letting me go, are you? You're never coming back, you god-damn bastard! Don't leave me alone! Open the damn door! [ Breathing heavily ] I've been waiting for you. No. [ Laughs ] [ Tyres squeal ] Ah! [ Grunting ] He has to be in there. [ Buzzing ] I'm sorry, Daddy... but we had to. [ Yells ] Oh, my God! [ Whining ] - Jody... - Yeah? Um, I opened up his... Forget it. Come on. There's this door down here... and I'll bet there's something behind it. Well, let's take a look, then. [ Electrical humming ] Well, that's the door. - Hey, man, I dunno... - Hey! Hi, guys. Reg... you ain't dead! No, and I ain't three foot two yet either. - What's going on? - Hey, man, I don't know. I've been hiding in a casket playing like a stiff, but I did find the girls. I found Sally and Sue, and a couple of other girls I never even saw before. Were they dead? No. I snuck 'em out a window and they took off through the bushes like scared rabbits. All right. Well... after you, my friend. You be my guest. Gee! Dwarfs! God, Reggie, look at this! [ Whooshing ] [ Girl ] Don't fear. [ Whooshing ] Aargh! [ Wailing ] Jesus! God... l just grabbed him there. - Slaves. - What? Slaves! They're using 'em for slaves! The dwarfs. And they gotta crush 'em... cos of the gravity... and the heat. And this is the door to their planet. Yeah! And these guys are all ready to go. Yeah. [ Humming ] [ Jody ] OK, stay together. [ Mike ] Wait, I think I got a lighter. [ Jody ] Light it up. [ Yells ] [ Jody ] Over here, follow me. [ Bang ] [ Reggie ] Jody, where are you? Mike? [ Growling ] Aw, shit! Mike! Mike, where are you? Mike! [ Electrical humming starts up ] [ Humming ] [ Gasps ] [ Howling wind ] Jody! Jody, where are you? Jody! Jody! Jody! [ Gasps ] Jody, where are you? [ Gasps ] Mike! Mike! Mike, Mike, come on, we gotta find Reggie. [ Gasping ] [ Groans ] [ Groans ] Where's Reggie? We gotta find him. Its Reggie! We - No! - Come on, we gotta help him! - No, you can't help him, he's dead! There's a... there's an old mine shaft, way down by... by the end of Singer's Creek. A thousand feet straight down. We just gotta... gotta figure out a way to get him up there. What are we gonna do without Reggie? Reggie's the last he'll ever get.. Cos we're gonna run that tall bastard straight down to hell. [ Sighs ] Look, you go in and try and find some more ammo. I'm gonna get rid of that warning barrier around the mine shaft and camouflage it. OK, lock up the house good, and stay in there. I'll be right back. Ah! [ Crashing ] [ Laughs ] Boy! You play a good game, boy, but the game is finished. Now you die! Don't fear. Don't fear. Oh! [ Wailing ] [ Wailing continues ] [ Gasps ] Don't fear. Ah! [ Screams ] [ Thunder rumbles ] [ Thunderclap ] I hear the sounds. I know those rocks aren't gonna hold him. Not for long. Hey, you had a dream. Just a nightmare. What do you expect? You've hardly slept since the funeral last week. - I know those rocks aren't gonna hold him. - [ Thunderclap ] First he took Mom and Dad... then he took Jody... now he's after me. Mike, that tall man of yours did not take Jody away. Jody died in a car wreck. [ Birds singing ] Mike... you had a bad dream. Now, I know you're scared... but you're not alone. I'll take care of you. I know I can't ever take Jody's place... but I'm sure as hell gonna try. Seems so real. You know, partner, what we need is a change of scenery. Why don't you and me hit the road for a couple of weeks? Where will we go? Well, I don't know. I guess we can figure that one out when we get there. OK. Well, get on upstairs, get your gear together, cos we leave when the sun comes up. [ Humming ] Boy! Aargh! [ Growling ]
