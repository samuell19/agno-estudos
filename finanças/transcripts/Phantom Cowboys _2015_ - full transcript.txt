[WIND WHISTLING] [ENGINE PUTTERING IN DISTANCE] [ENGINE WHINING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [FIRE CRACKLING] [ENGINE RUMBLES] [WIND WHISTLING] NICK: I see some guy laying in the middle of the road taking pictures of plants. Like, just laying there, just taking pictures. We asked him, "Are you all right?" He's like, "Yeah, I'm just fascinated with the desert." I'm like, "Okay, that's great. Continue." And he says, "Isn't it exciting living here?" I'm like, "No, not really. It's all right. But, I mean, it's a place that I call home." And she... And they're like, "Yeah, that's great." And they say they wish they were from here. I'm like, "I bet you'll think twice if you lived here. You will have a diff... Second opinion." [CHEERLEADERS CHANTING] BOY: One, two, three. TEAM: Eight! BOY: One, two, three. TEAM: Nine! BOY: One, two, three. TEAM: Ten! NICK: Besides football and school, I wish there was more things to do. It's like once you're in Trona, you're... That's it, you're sinking in. [WHISTLE BLOWS] NICK: That's what the talk is at school, but I don't believe that. If you want it, you chase it, I guess. COACH: In case something does happen with the center. All right? So, guys, we need to work hard this week on offense. Okay? But for now, get this finished up, get down, and let's get out of here. NICK: My dad will probably say I should go to college, stuff like that. So I don't know. I don't know what I'm gonna do. Hopefully, I don't work at the plant. Hopefully. But first is the school. That's the first thing I need to do. From there is, gonna get a job, and then there... ...who knows? I guess time will only tell. NICK: [SCOFFS] Look at that line. Everyone's going to work. I feel real lucky. Probably, kids in my class don't even... Don't even make, like, what I make. Only like a few of us is going to college and doing something. But not many people are doing things. [MACHINERY WHIRRING] NICK: I wanna go to the ocean again. That's one thing I miss. I only seen it once, the whole ocean. One time. One time. It was like a giant lake to me. Like a giant lake. I asked my dad, "Is this a giant lake?" And he's like, "No, it's the ocean." And as he explained it, I thought it was scary... because he told me all the stuff that lives in the ocean, like sharks and stuff like that. So I got kind of scared. I stayed close to the shore. The waves washed me in. It was fun. I miss that. [MUSIC PLAYING] I wouldn't mind living in a city or something. Go to France, stuff like that. I wanna go to New York, see the Statue of Liberty, see how big it is. I've seen the one in Las Vegas. I've seen that one. I wanna see the real one. I wanna see what else is out there besides a small town like this. [WIND WHISTLING] What's the date? MAN: What's the date? Yeah. Seventeen? MAN: Uh... Sixteen. You all ready? You ready? My name is Larry Young, broadcasting 1-16-010. Today's topic is about sugarcane and what come out of sugarcane. Did you know in these things we get all our sugar? And, also, rabbits come out of here. This piece of thing right here, so delicious. How about you have it? Have it. Would you like to have it? Yes, come on, just take it. And that's the topic. Yep, that's them. That's a baby there. I think we only got three red lights in Pahokee. Yeah, three red lights. Got few restaurants. On school days, only thing I do is go home, watch TV, take a shower, and go to sleep. And go to school the next day. I peeled it. [LARRY RAPPING] [HANDS CLAPPING] [CONTINUES RAPPING AND CLAPPING] [RAPPING] LARRY: Best friend is Randy. Stay right in the back of my house. Yeah, he crazy. Sometimes we go fishing together. We sit on my back porch, play cards. Go in the house and play the game. Everything. [LAUGHS] LARRY: There ain't nothing for the kids to do around here. They had a teen club. They closed it down because fighting and everything. They can't keep nothing down here. LARRY: I just missed three years of my life, man, so I'm trying to catch up. For me. You know what I mean? Right here, this right here, I'm trying to catch up. Prison is prison. It's... Prison is somewhere you sleep behind a door. The food messed up, like, stuff like that. But prisons, you sleep, you do your time, you get out of there. I mean, it ain't... It's a bad place to be, but it's not dangerous. I ain't experienced no bad things in there. Everything different. I've been gone so long, everything different. Everybody growed up, got kids... ...stuff like that. No, there ain't too much we wanna really talk about, 'cause it ain't... Pahokee is Pahokee, you know what I mean? We could've filmed good in the sugarcane field and stuff like that. But I ain't got no dirty shoes to go out rabbit-hunting in. I ain't got none of that. [BOTH LAUGHING] I can jump that right there. Here's where we live right here. Muck City. You already know. Come on, man. [RUMBLING] MAN 1: We missed that big rabbit there. What do you say? Wanna hit the other side over there? Right in there, three come up. Found one. Yeah, go down low. There she is. Go down low, go down low. Check the space. MAN 2: Where you at? RANDY: We got... LARRY: Oh, no! Got one over there! [GUNSHOT] [RABBIT SCREAMING] MAN 1: Shot the shit out of one. MAN 2: You took them out of the bucket? [BIRDS CHIRPING] TYLER: In this town, it's about the worst to make money. The jobs here has got a lot more to do with either computers or fast food. That's about it. That's all we got around here. If it wasn't for working on cars, I don't know what I'd be doing. I'd say just the way the economy is now, I'd probably be in jail. I put more time into racing than anything. I mean, that's just what I was raised around. I'm used to doing it. I try to control myself where I spend time with the family. But racing always takes over. I got racing through my veins. I don't know what it is. [ENGINE RUMBLING] TYLER: I'm not much of a NASCAR fan, because I feel like it's... It's not really racing. It's just driving on pavement. Who can't drive a car on pavement? Dirt racing, you got to have some pretty good talent. It feels like any kind of thought or worries you ever had in your life's all gone. I mean, you're sitting in heaven, to me. It's something I would never wanna live without. TYLER: Hey, bub. Running, driving. That's gonna drive like a brand-new truck. Yeah, but I'm gonna go ahead and start it. MAN: That baby staying in there? Yeah, it'll be all right. It's cool. MAN: Is it not loud? Kind of. [IGNITION WHINES, ENGINE REVS] TYLER: He had this truck. I was fucking around and said, "I'll buy that truck off of you." He said, "No, I don't wanna sell it." See, he went to the Army and shit. Bought this truck. He dumped the money in that motor. He thought this thing... He act like this thing was a 2012 Corvette. I mean, he was like, "I'm telling you right now, this thing, it'll run." On and on and on. He said it's got a true posi rear end, got them aftermarket rally wheels on it. He said, "You wouldn't believe people offer me money for them wheels." MAN: What'd you get them for?[SIGHS] Come on. Too much. Two grand. I'm in it. Two grand. You're close. Real close, guarantee it. Twenty-two. You're close. [IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE] Hey, baby. [CAR ENGINES WHINING] Give me a kiss. I got to get ready. Kiss. I got to get in the car. Kiss. Kiss me, I'm gonna get ready. I'm going over. Okay. TYLER: If I get my ass waxed in this dash? We're going to do a flip-around, see what we can do. What we got to lose? Don't run on the high side. I did in that modified. I run where I got to go. Love you. TYLER: Heck, four, five years ago, I was just racing. That was just a hobby. I was just goofing off, having a good time. I didn't care about the money. I just made a choice one day. I either need to get better or I need to quit. So I did a lot of cutting, a lot of rebuilding, a lot of thought and studying, and it started coming my way. And now I just worry about things that I never even thought about then. [MUSIC PLAYING ON CAR RADIO] [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] MAN: But tell all them animal lovers we don't just go kill rabbits 'cause we got drunk. You know, and we just, you know, went and got high on drugs. We don't kill them, you know, because we drug addicts. We kill them for survival. And something got to eat something. That's the way of the world right there. RANDY: Gotta show y'all my secret ingredients. I cook good, you know. Turn on my cooking channel for ya. That's what I'm gonna be. Junior, how the rabbit taste? Ain't got much meat on that sucker. WOMAN: Get a big one next time. RANDY: We should've got a big one. JUNIOR: Yeah, we should have. [MUSIC PLAYING LOUDLY] There go Larry. There go Larry. LARRY: Trent! All I need is one rabbit, just one single rabbit. TRENT: Walk through there? Seen a rabbit, Larry? Swear to God. What? Hey, Trent, we mucksters. TRENT: What? Mucksters. TRENT: We mucksters. Oh, yeah. Mucksters. LARRY: I was getting a little money out there, you know. I did 48 months at the Department of Corrections. They charged me with aggravated battery and robbery with a firearm. Man, they say I shot somebody. Yeah, I ain't shoot nobody, though, man. I was just around the wrong people. I didn't do nothing, man. Guilty by association. What's up? What's up? I missed you! What up, dude? What's going on? Where's Justin at? Look at my boy. LARRY: What's up? My baby, you look like an old man. For real. For real. Look at my baby. Looking all good. You okay? Yeah. Not bad, eh? It feels good to be home. [ALL LAUGH] About two and a half years.Yeah.

Yeah. LARRY: I went to prison when my little brother was six months. Now he's 4 years old and turning 5. I got to help him. He gonna end up like the rest of my mom's sons, going to jail, getting shot, picking up guns and stuff like that. It can't happen like that. He look up to me. I ain't look up to nobody. People I looked up to, they were just like me. Where you at? LARRY: Hello? Yeah, man. Yeah, I'm finally home. Yeah, I got it all right this time. Whatever, you know where to be. Yeah, I did get out just now. Yeah, man, we at McDonald's right now. I'm about to eat, man. Yeah, man, they tried to... They tried to stick me back there for the long. [MAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ON PHONE] You know, nigga go crazy after a while back there. Yeah, I'm gonna call you all later. I ain't had no McDonald's in three years, man. [WOMEN LAUGH] LARRY: Yeah, man, I'll holler at you. I ain't had this in three years. [WOMEN LAUGH] [MUSIC PLAYING] NICK: I really don't know that much about it, but the economy needs to get better. I heard that it's bad, and we're still paying for that war everybody says we're going through. Taxes are gonna go up, gas prices are gonna go up. It's gonna be bad. Honestly, I think the town's gonna get smaller. I hope not, though. I hope it gets bigger. I wish it was still the same as 40 years ago. Probably would've been easier to get out back then. And it'll be harder now 'cause there's not much... There's not that much work, I guess. The plant's doing really well to keep a place like this running for as long as it did. One of our players actually got a scholarship, and he turned it down to work in the plant. I guess Trona grows on them. Maybe they're afraid of a new start or something. [MACHINERY WHIRRING] NICK: I could have used that like five minutes ago. MAN: I didn't see you had a problem. NICK: I got paint in the freaking bolt hole. MAN: I see it. NICK: Put the backing plates on it, expansion joint. Then put... Does he wanna put the base bolts first? Because the expansion don't remove. CARLOS: Yeah, I know. NICK: Every day, I make my dad proud. If I'm working on the steam lines, on the steam traps, if I see him, if I'm lucky, if he's nearby, I tell him jobs that I've done. If it's like a pipe job, he goes out there, he goes to check it. If I did great, if I did crappy, he'll me what I need to do. He'll tell me if I did good. And I respect that, and I look forward to having that guide. CARLOS: Hell, I was, what, 23, 24, I think. When you did that? When I did that. I did that one, that one and that one over there. From here to here, and from here to here. And that determines your... Yeah. Twenty-three.Yeah. Look at that. CARLOS: What's going on, Jim? I was calling you. I made the pieces for you. JIM: You did? CARLOS: Yeah. Here, I don't know if, uh... CARLOS: Oh, were you? MAN: Yeah. CARLOS: Yeah, I made the... Yeah, when I... I know, I know, I know.

GIRL: I was loud. [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] TYLER: I enjoyed growing up, with my dad always going to the garage and working. When I got out of school, I went to the garage, and that was my life. I did the same thing he did. I've had my ups and downs, but my dad basically forced me to get my head on right. [ENGINE REVVING] [ENGINE ROARING] [RATCHETING] [ENGINES REVVING] MAN: After qualifications, we need all motors shut off for the national anthem, all right? After qualifications... TYLER: My dad didn't push me into racing, because when he was racing, I was younger. He wasn't very successful, but that's what he wanted to do. But he was trying to encourage me to do something more realistic. But I felt like that's all I knew. And if he was doing it, why couldn't I? [SANDER WHIRRING] [BOTH SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] [ENGINES REVVING] [WOMAN SINGING "THE STAR-SPANGLED BANNER"] [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] [ENGINE IDLING] Good luck. I ain't gonna need it. MAN: Bub, when you spin out, text me "LOL." I will. I'll put "WTF." Hey. Just give it hell and turn left. [ENGINES ROARING] MAN: I thought he was gonna get you. That yellow wouldn't have come out... Son of bitch, I was... I'd go high, he'd slide up high. I'd go low... Not that he knew I was there, but it seemed like he did. MAN: Good race, bub. Thanks, bub. From the start, I could feel him coming in, but I couldn't get it to turn. I'm gonna rig me up tires with spikes that long for this goddamn place. IESHA: You're gone from 8 in the morning till almost 8 at night. He gets off work at 5. He could come home, but he goes over to the race shop. Yeah. My pride and joy. IESHA: Pride and joy is supposed to be right there. That's one of them. [COOS][IESHA CHUCKLES] IESHA: You know, you ever heard of the I.A. riots? TYLER: I don't care for them. Don't care to listen. IESHA: Derek was talking about that Rodney King guy that died. TYLER: Who's that? IESHA: You don't know about him? TYLER: I know Ken Griffey Jr. IESHA: [LAUGHING] You're stupid. That's a black guy that got beat by a bunch of white cops, and then all the white cops were... Yeah, I heard about that. IESHA: Proven innocent, so they... Beating up everybody. Give me the remote. Let me find something better. IESHA: Like what? TYLER: Family Guyor... [IESHA SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] [TV PLAYING INDISTINCTLY] You girls wanna watch cartoons? Where's the clicker? GIRL: No, I wanna watch... I wanna watch Peter. [BOTH CHUCKLING] It's called Family Guy. [CHUCKLING] [GIRL LAUGHING AND TALKING INDISTINCTLY] TYLER: How come you still got your shoes on? GIRL: I like them on. TYLER: Take your shoes off. Put them up. Give me that. Give me kisses. I love you bunches, okay? I love you. Give me a kiss. Give me a kiss. Give me a kiss. You bought some flimsy eggs. IESHA: I thought I was getting a good deal. Twenty minutes to close one. Okay. This one's probably not gonna get closed. [IESHA LAUGHS] You guys are gonna have a half egg. IESHA: They're ready. [GIRL CHEERING] TYLER: Lookie. Look right here. Look right here. What's that? [SOBBING]What's that? Did you find one? Come on. Put it in... Put it in here. That's yours. Now, go find more? GIRL: Got a bunch of them. TYLER: Yeah, you got a half a million. IESHA: That... Get back over here. Come here, Maddi. Do you see any more? Where's another one at? TYLER: Yeah, well, bleed it. Make sure it works first. We ain't gonna be able to tell nothing. Till I get in here, hit the brakes, and somebody... MAN: Are you free now? TYLER: Yeah, free. Hit the brake. MAN: Hit the brake. Daddy, is that hot? No, it's not hot. I haven't had it running yet. You can touch it. It won't burn your finger right yet. GIRL: Can I play with Karleigh? Yeah, you can play with her. [WHIRRING] [SCREAMS, LAUGHS] GIRL: Move, get that out of the way. Get out of the way. I've got about four months in it. Built her from the ground up. Started with a pile of tubing, now she's together. I feel like we're gonna pick up a win, I hope. Ain't gonna be a walk in the park, but about the next thing to it. I'm thankful to run as good as I have been here recently. It's like, last year, I won 25 races. That helps out a lot. If I was just running fourth or fifth, it'd be a lot tougher. I'd have to skip out a few weeks till I got better. I see it more of a business now than just a hobby. Obviously, I ain't gonna make a real great living running at the stage we're at, but get to where you master local tracks, then you can venture off and run places... And run for 50,000 win, 20,000. They got them races all over the place. I don't care how good we are or how fast we are. There's always something better you can do. Just got to find it. [ENGINE RUNNING] [ENGINE REVVING] NICK: Twenty is when I bought the car. You know, not a lot of 20-year-olds can say: "Hey, I got a $45,000 car. And I paid for that in cash." I wanted a car, I got a car. I worked my tail off to get my car. Something of pride, you know, to say, "Hey, I bought that. No one helped me. I bought that." That's what I like, knowing that I have goals... and I've accomplished one of them by getting myself a car. And now my next one's gonna be bit of a pricey one. It's a house. I know I can do it. It's just gonna take a long time. I wanna be able to come over and say: "Hey, Ma, what's for dinner?" You know what I mean? If I don't feel like cooking, "Hey, Ma, what's for dinner? You ain't coming over. I'll be over there in five minutes." [KICKSTART THUMPING] Hey, when you start it, make sure it's top dead center and then go. CJ: You try. NICK: I ain't gonna try. It's your bike. [KICKSTARTER THUMPING] [ENGINE STARTS] It fires up. When I teach my brother how to do things, like change the chain on a bicycle, or change the rim or change the tire or even change the spokes, I try to test him on things. You know what I mean? I take a part like a lawn-mower motor or something, something simple. Just take it apart, and he can try to put it back together. Find out what's wrong with it. Point out what's wrong. Identify what's wrong and then fix it. It helps him on basic understanding of how things work. LARRY: Little brother don't know about no fast money right now, so we ain't gonna teach him what fast money is. So I can teach him which way to go, because I been on the wrong path, and I can teach him the right path, you know. "That's not what you're supposed to do. You can't do that. You'll go to jail." He's scared of police right now. If he hear the police siren, he's gonna start crying. Because he don't really know what jail is right now. I don't want him to know what it's like. The last of the Mohicans right here. Last of the Mohicans. Right here. It's the last of the Mohicans right here. MAN: High-five. LARRY: You got to dance to the beat, Justin. [RAP MUSIC PLAYING] He's stilted like his dad.[LAUGHS] MAN: He's in jail. He violated probation. WOMAN: I'm so glad he didn't have to jump out on that. MAN: He's all right. None of that, right? Probation and stuff. That's a setup. That ain't nothing but a trap. MAN: I got ordained, deacon and everything in the church, so... You gonna be celibate? MAN: I invite you... I'm married. Okay, okay, okay. WOMAN: He married. He is a married man now. MAN: Look forward to inviting you. It ain't gonna be all the time. Every now and then. I ain't say all the time. Mercedes and all of them... Don't Mercedes go to your church? MAN: Mercedes been in a minute. Yeah, it's nice. Young folks. That is the bomb. It goes on everything. Beans and But it's a certain kind. It's a certain kind, though. It feel different, but it's still the same, though. Still the same. I got to go try to find my girlfriend now. [HIP-HOP PLAYING ON RADIO] I love it. Now I got all my babies. They ain't incarcerated. I got all my babies. MAN: Check him out. LARRY: What's up, boy? [BOTH SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] TRENT: Growing up, that was like one of my best friends. Just seeing him home, it just feel good. It make you feel better, like: "All right, now one of them home. Now let's bring the rest on home." [MUSIC PLAYING] Now where about he at? LARRY: I said right here. I saw him going down. Man, that bitch be too fast, man. It probably went in that hole. LARRY: What hole? TRENT: With the time I spent with him and the time they took away from him... Growing up without one of your best friends, and another one of your best friends get locked up, then another one... It's like, man, you're taking everything I love around me. So I don't know. I just look at it like... my friends are gone, so I'm basically out here by myself. [MUSIC PLAYING] TRENT: When they burn cane, it smells like... Let me see. It's like you've burnt a bottle of oil, when you burn oil and gasoline, mix it up. There's nothing but black when the cane burn, and then it burn the leaves, and it'll go all up into the air and then start falling down like snow. TRENT: You know, with Larry, you feel me. Some things you want that you can't get. You got to find a way to get it, and then he got in trouble the way he was getting it. So that's basically that. Anywhere you go, you can get involved with the wrong people, and some things can happen to you. But that don't necessarily mean the person that you is, but that's just the situation you got yourself into. We get talked about more than we get talked up. Only thing we're known around for here is football, if it's good. When it's bad, we drug dealers, we killers, we animals, we all type of thing... We everything but humans, like... But it's the predicament y'all put us in. It's the environment we was put in. All we have to do is adapt to it. It's not us. We adapt into our environment. When they say we these bad things, I say we're a product of our environment, that's it. [MEN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] [RAPPING] [MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO] TYLER: Dude, I love race day. Right. It's race day, son. Everything disappears. Everything. Ain't no nothing. Ain't nothing else matters. Nothing. MAN: Hey, I like your car this year, bub. Looks pretty good. [MAN SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY] [LAUGHS] [SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY] MAN: Out of Turn 4, you stay double file through the barrel. Through the barrel. Do not duck down, do not pass anybody till you get through the barrel. All right? Front row starts the race. Front row sets the pace, front row starts the race. You looked at the track yet? I went out there, stepped on it. Did you actually...? Yeah. You can hoof it about almost a half inch. Really? But that shit blow off, right? I hope. I don't know, I'm just nervous. I wanna see you win first night out. [WOMAN SINGING "THE STAR-SPANGLED BANNER"] MAN: From Franklinville, New York, Number 22 JR is Michael Oakes. Inside of Row Number 2, Driver Number 28 from Parkersburg, three-time feature winner Tyler Carpenter. Green's out. Let's see if we can get a good start. A little bit of paint trading further back in the field there, in the one and two. Right off the get-go, Tyler Carpenter challenging Number 22, Greg Oakes. Carpenter up into the number-three spot. And the caution flag does come out. TYLER: Hey, it don't matter. I got it. I'm just getting started. MAN: Stepping around the bottom, a little loose, goes Carpenter. One more lap to go. Carpenter now has advanced, and he will win. TYLER: Wooo! TYLER: I don't care if the whole field crashed. I was gonna get them! Yeah, baby! [PEOPLE CHATTERING EXCITEDLY] Gonna be about 50 wins this year. MAN: Everybody hold the number one up. TYLER: I'm just glad we're smiling instead of like, "Fuck!" How's it feel to get them wins donated to you? I was gonna get it anyhow. You wasn't gonna get me, son. I was still in low gear. I can't wait till they post the video. I thought I was gonna pass all you guys in the first lap, but I passed everybody but you and him. I was like: "You sons of bitches." MAN: We try not to race at the same place because we can't both win. Which, he beats me more than I beat him. I'm gonna try not to give him any more like last night. We got it well beat out. Gonna head for Atomic. I got to go down to... I got to go up there and win tonight. Yeah. TYLER: My dad definitely had it a lot tougher than I did. When he was raising me, I didn't even think of it. When you're young, you don't really worry about money. It don't mean... It don't cross your mind. If I had been him, as rough as we had it back then, I'd have thrown in the towel. He'd just never give up. He worked hard and got everything we got, and he worked just the same stuff I'm doing, daylight to dark. Sometimes he wouldn't come home till midnight, 1:00 or whatever. I didn't have a lot of time with my dad. I had to wait till I was old enough to go to the garage or hang out with him at a racetrack. He couldn't give us a lot of time growing up, but he's really taught me how to become a good father. There's a lot of dads out there that are just dads. They don't care to be a father. I mean, I'm real proud of, basically, what he's made me become. [TURN SIGNAL CLICKING] GIRL: Daddy! TYLER: Hang on, buddy. It stinks. GIRL: Come and see our new room. Come here. TYLER: Hold on. GIRL: No, come here. TYLER: Come on, Jaycee. GIRL 2: Daddy, come here. Daddy, come in here first with us. TYLER: What's this sticky on your fingers, baby? GIRL: That's slime. That girl over there gave us slime we could play with. TYLER: Feels like Popsicle. Sure it ain't Popsicle? GIRL: And she ate Popsicle. Yes, it's Popsicle. TYLER: Yeah, she wants corn. You want chicken fries, baby? What else is it? [TV DRONING INDISTINCTLY] Smile with Jackson. [WHISTLES] [GROANS] Jaycee, get me a rag. What are you doing? You clogged up? [COOS][IMITATES COO] [LAUGHS] [BLOWS RASPBERRY] CHEERLEADERS: [CHANTING] Come on, team, come on! Everybody yell! Go, Big Blue!

[COMMENTATOR SPEAKING ON PA] [PEOPLE CHEERING][WHISTLE BLOWS] NICK: Game's the other way, buddy. Oh, they slept in the gym? They still do that? WOMAN: Yeah. Nice. That's another thing I miss. NICK: He quit because you were the last one? MAN: Yeah, I was the last one. That was a good game The last game? MAN: Oh, that was good. Remember how many tackles I got? MAN 1: Wasn't it like 30? Thirty. My number. I got 30 tackles. I was like, "Yeah." That was nice. I miss the pressure. Pressure? Playing, I miss the pressure. That's a good one. As for me, I think it's just eating dirt. Eating dirt? That dirt in your mouth. Where else can you get that besides here? Dirt in your mouth, dirt in your ear. Know what's cool? You hit somebody when the field's nice and clean, they'll slide. [PEOPLE CHEERING] [WHISTLE BLOWS] I had an opportunity to play college football over there in Washington, but I just got homesick, I guess. I didn't want to leave family. But I don't have no regrets, though. I don't. I'm happy either way. Would have been nice to play, though. Would have been nice to be in college. And doing all that. Maybe I made the wrong choice. I don't know. Who knows? CHEERLEADERS: ...35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46. [ALL CHEER] TYLER: My goal in life was to be a very successful dirt racer and then to hit the high end of the touring series. If I didn't have kids, I know I could do it. And with me having them, I just kind of choose not to do it, because I'd be away from the kids a lot more than I am now. But having kids, that makes you wanna grow up and be a dad other than just a kid. It's made me grow up a lot faster than I thought I would have. Maybe put stuff on, here. This is the stuff. Close your eyes. Hold on. I got to get it out. Don't move. Turn and look at me. TYLER: Come on, baby, we'll be late. Give me your phone. Make sure you put your seat belts on. GIRL: No, Riley, leave him alone. TYLER: Kiss me. Love you. Love you. TYLER: Back there. Hurry up. [MAN SPEAKING ON RADIO INDISTINCTLY] Daddy, are you gonna pick me up like you promised yesterday? TYLER: I'll pick you up. From school? TYLER: Mm-hmm. Pinky promise me, then. Thank you. Give me kisses. GIRL: No, I want to go in. Kisses. And then... Go down there by the cafeteria, okay? I'll pick you up. I got a pretty good life, you know what I'm saying? All my kids are healthy. I'm doing pretty good racing now, getting very successful. Uh... I got a job I can go to every day. I got a good source of income. Definitely... I could be a lot worse off. I mean, I'm doing pretty good, I guess. Not doing great, but doing a lot better than I used to do. [ENGINES ROARING] Go! Go! Come on, Daddy! MAN: Here goes Carpenter again, trying to get in front of 59. Can't get it done. ...Over a second, in front of Tyler Carpenter. There's only one lap to go. TYLER: Fuck! MAN: That's a good job, Ty. That's a good job. That lap car fucked you. That's a good job. [SIGHS] TYLER: Fucking junk. MAN: You want to turn your ignition off? TYLER: Fuck! I think that caution hurt you. It did. The tires was just starting to come on. I know. It didn't wanna stick after that. Fuck! GIRL: Daddy. Daddy. What, baby? Daddy sucked? IESHA: No. That lap car is what fucked you. [GROANS] GIRL: I said I want you to win. MAN: Wipe your face off. RANDY: If you're standing too long in this smoke, it make your eyes... It make... You can't even see. A lot of people, they like rabbit, but they scared to catch them. You catch them with a rock, with a stick, anything, with your hands. It make you feel good when you can catch a burn. It make you feel real good just to be somewhere where you like to be. MAN: That's all I can say. He had fun and kept it real. Can't say too much. I love him, though. All of us love him. Still posing like he's still here. MAN: It was like a unity. With him, it's affecting the whole community. I received a call about... About 3 a.m. Three a.m. Never thought I was gonna get that call. And got there, you know, time had expired. Watching them grow up is like seeing them just sprout up like a little flower. You watch them grow up, make sure that they doing the right thing, you know. But we still keep his dream alive. What? Everything Gucci, man? MAN 1: Everything Gucci. MAN 2: Everything Gucci. MAN 1: Everything Gucci? MAN 3: Everything. MAN 1: If he was here, we'd be still keeping him alive like he was here. One time, everything what? ALL: Everything Gucci, man. [ALL CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] [MUSIC PLAYING] LARRY: It was just a shooting. I don't know what happened with Randy. I ain't never get the details. I ain't never wanna get the details. That might force my hand, it gonna hurt someone. You know, I don't wanna hurt nobody, man. So I don't wanna know what happened and who he was with who. I don't wanna know. Nobody wanted to tell me in prison, because everybody knew me and Randy were closer than anything. Yeah. NICK: Most of my friends from high school did move away. They moved to I.A., they moved to over there in Palmdale. They just... They moved. But this is home. It's home, you know. I can't leave it. I would prefer this place over any other place. Because I know it. I know the people, I know what it's like. And I don't know what the other places would be like. I can't imagine it. It's too scary to think about it. LARRY: I've been living in Pahokee all my life, but I just wanna explore more. I was ready, but I had too much things on my mind. I was doing too many things at one time. I was ready, but I couldn't just put the old life behind. How you all doing? They got me in the box again, man. You fuck up, you'll pay the price, man. I just made some mistakes. That's all. I got out October 3rd, 2015, and went back in February. I caught two years. Oh, man, I was in the car with somebody. They pulled the car over. They had a lot of stuff in the car. They charged me with it, all of it. I'd be all gas, no brakes. I'd be getting to it right now. I'm trying to become a millionaire. It's a lot of time, but, you know, I'm still young. You feel me? They took something from me, but I'll still live past it. It ain't like I'm 50, 40. I'm 20 years old. I can do my time up under the table, man. As long as them days keep rolling. As long as them days don't stop now. Trying to get back home. Just move as time goes, man. [ENGINES REVVING] TYLER: I don't know, man... You changed the gears, right? Yeah. I think you'll be good, man. You'll be able to carry momentum. Oh, yeah, you'll be all right. You got a horse. Oh, mini mammoth. TYLER: I've been to different cities and states and... I don't know, I don't see where I would kind of fit in anywhere else. This is all I know. But I've got four girls. I'd like to keep the family tradition going, but I can't make them wanna race or make them wanna work on a race car. There's a lot more high-paying jobs away from here, I'm sure. So I'm just gonna have to kind of follow their dreams and their footsteps. We may have to move couple two or three states away to see what they wanna do. I don't wanna do that, but I'm gonna go with whatever makes my girls successful. I'll push and yank toward whatever we got to do to make it happen. Love you. IESHA: Love you. Give me a kiss. [MUSIC PLAYING] [ENGINE RUMBLING] [ENGINES ROARING] NICK: What I was afraid of when I was 17... I don't remember, but if I had to take a guess, it's probably failing. I feared if I'm gonna have a job, if I'm gonna be able to go to college. See, I fear... I feared those things. And now I don't fear that at all. Oh, almost. Go, CJ, go, go, go. Put it in gear. [ENGINE REVVING] Go, CJ, go. He's a beginner. He's all right. He's doing all right. At least he's staying up. He hasn't dropped it yet. He'll get there. I know he will. I'll see to he gets there. Go, CJ, go, go! When you get better, we'll take you up there. Think you can do it? Yeah. NICK: You think you can do it? Yeah. NICK: You sure? Positive. This is where I first learned how to ride. Many crashes. Many crashes. All up and down here. It's nice. And I remember when Raymond got a whole bunch of dirt here, for his little house... His mansion. He got all this dirt, and he left it like this. I was like, "Hey, look at that. I can turn this into something." The house I want is right here. I want this part. Be able to move in, start a family and have my own little... My own little slice of heaven here. You know? This is my home. Have the little kids drive around their little motorcycles on this track. Having picnics up here. Having the pond going. Always keep it full, have fish in it, go fishing, go swimming. Once I have it done, I can sit back and say: "Hey, look, I accomplished all this. I did this." Or me and my dad, we did all this. You know, and plant trees. I have goals. I want... I want a great house. I want to have a house, hey, that my kids will love. They can go out whenever they want, have... Ride their bikes, bring their friends over, have a nice picnic here, go swimming. It'd be perfect. This will be their slice of heaven. Give them a little something that I grew up with. That's what I want. I really want it. Battery's still dead, huh? [ENGINE REVVING] RANDY: Tell me when to stop. Keep going. Now turn down. [GUNSHOT]There you go. RANDY: He's coming up! Grab him! Grab him! LARRY: Right here! Grab him. MAN: Just grab that bitch. He ain't gonna bite you. LARRY: There you go. See that bitch. MAN: Watch out. I got it. LARRY: You wanna watch it. MAN: Watch it. Where'd it go? Here, here. He's coming now. Oh, now, here. Oh, shit, come on, man. Come on, man. That's it. LARRY: All right, it's dead, it's dead, it's dead. [ALL CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] [MUSIC PLAYING] MAN: This shit about to get wild. And when I was in Pahokee, that's the only thing I knew, Pahokee. That's just where I was raised. It don't mean nothing to me. I don't really think back that far, man. That stress a nigga out, man. I don't know, man. Just a little city. That's all, man. Time to move. You get tired of old things, you feel me? I'm trying to do new things. I might go to college. I was trying to go to college when I was out, though, but I was still moving too fast. I wasn't ready. But I'm 20 years old. I'm still gonna make her proud. You feel me? I can still go to college and stuff and make her proud. I'm gonna make this my last trip to prison, right here. I'm just trying to get a job and live like a normal dude, man. [CHAINS CLINKING] I got your brother. I got your brother. Going to get him. I'm going to get him. Yes, sir. .22 rifle. Right there and right there. Come on out. Come on out, little man. Come on out. When I was little, the only thing I used to like is riding my bicycle every day, riding back and forth with my friends. It was more better. If I leave, I'll come back. Because this is where I growed up at. [FIRE CRACKLING] [ENGINES WHINING] [ENGINE IDLING] [WIND WHISTLING]
