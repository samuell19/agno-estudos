[funk music] [applause] - Greetings, ladies and gentlemen. We have a red hot show for you this evening. Are you ready for it? [cheering] Are you ready for it? [cheering] We've got something so fantastic. We have the man himself, Dolemite, the king of comedy records. The fabulous Mr. Rudy Ray Moore. Let's hear it for him. [applause] - Dolemite is my name and rapping and tapping is my game. I took today and brought back yesterday. Took the fourth of July and put it in June, and made leap year jump over the motherfucking moon. Holy drummers, y'all sure beat well. I aint lying. Just look at that little simple one over there. Do you beat everything like you beat the drums? Huh? Answer me, nigga. If you do, you're a hell of a libido. That nigga looks just like my old dumb brother. I had a brother beat just like him. My brother beat his meat so much, every time he sticks his hand in his pocket, his dick would start to dodging. [laughter] I aint lying. If his had have been sandpaper, his dick would've been sharp as a needle. [laughter] My brother's dumb. My brother was so dumb, every time he went to a crap game, he kept four rolls of toilet paper. [laughter] That motherfucker was so stupid, he thought manual labor was a Mexican. [laughter] He was so dumb, he turned down a blowjob because he thought he would lose his unemployment check. [laughter] I aint lying. [applause] My brother's so dumb, he thinks that 69 is the pope's phone number. [laughter] He's so stupid [laughter], he thinks Kotex is mattress for mice. [laughter] I aint lying. Same thing happened to me the other day. Listen. I was in my bathroom minding my own business. I was up like that, washing up like that, and one of my friends walked in on me and said, "Rudy, "you aint no longer my friend. "You're standing up in here beating your meat." I looked at him and said, "Why, you ignorant, simple motherfucker. "This is my house, my soap, my water, "and this is my dick and I'll wash it "as fast as I want to." [applause] I know a girl who wanted to have a baby. She got three boyfriends. You know, she laid down and she socked her stuff to that first boyfriend for about 30 minutes. He grunted one time. She looked at him and said, "Daddy, "what are we going to name our baby?" He jumped out the bed and said, "Bitch, I aint never went for that shit." Second boyfriend got on the stuff and rode it for about two hours. He grunted three times. [grunts] She said, "Oh, daddy, daddy, daddy. "What we gonna name the baby?" This motherfucker ran out the door, making 100 miles an hour. She said, "I aint got but one more boyfriend. "I aint taking no chances on this motherfucker. "I want to see that he got it all there." This son of a bitch rolled up and down in that pussy for about five hours. Then he fell off and went to sleep. She hunched him in the side and said, "Wake up, daddy. "Wake up, wake up, wake up. "What we gonna name the baby?" This motherfucker jumps out of the bed, pulls off the rubber, ties it in a knot, throws it against the wall, and said if the motherfucker get loose from there, we're gonna name him Hercules, baby. [laughter] [applause] I aint lying. Now, I've been everywhere in the course of my lifetime. I was in New York the other day standing on the corner of a street and a fellow walked up to me and said, "Rudy, you are a movie star. "Why don't you help the blind man across the street?" I said, "You got to be a damn fool, man. "What in the shit can he see on "the other side of the street "that he can't see on this side of the street?" I left him standing there. Aint got no business out sight seeing no way. While I was standing there, a dog come by and raised up his leg and pissed on the blind man. I aint lying. The blind man just stood there. I said, "Sock it to him rover. "Sock it to him." Then, all at once, the blind man reached in his bag, and handed the dog a cookie. I walked up to the blind man, said "Sir, that dog just pissed all over you, "and you rewarded him by giving him a cookie." He said, "Rewarded him hell. "I'm trying to see where this son of a bitch's head is "because I'm gonna kick this motherfucker's ass." [laughter] [applause] I go everywhere, I travel all over the country, and when I was in Toledo, Ohio, I got on the bus, you know, and a man got on the bus behind me with a damn monkey. It made me mad. So I went to the bus driver. I said, "Bus driver, "do you allow monkeys to ride this bus?" He said, "You go over there and sit down, "you damn fool. "Won't nobody know you on here." [applause] And I know y'all know I'm lying this time. And as I say, when I was in Toledo, I went over to Detroit and I got there and they said, "Rudy, won't you go over to the hospital "and visit the children in the children's ward?" So I had to do that. I went to the children's ward and when I got there, the strangest thing was happening. There were two little babies in the crib pen playing. A little boy baby and a little girl baby. All at once, I heard the little girl child start to screaming. [screams] "Rape, rape!" Little boy baby looked at her and said, "Shut up "and roll over, you're laying on your pacifier." [applause] You know? What's wrong with you, darling? Now that's what I call a lot of ass. Mama, this place could catch on fire and they tell everybody to haul ass, you'd have to make two trips. [laughter] [cheering] As I say, I was walking down the street the other day and this little ugly child comes running up to me, hollering, "Mister, mister, mister." She was so ugly, she looked like crime in the face. She was just so ugly, she looked like she had been short stopping alligators. She was just so ugly, she could break daylight with her fists. In fact, she raised the windows and opened the doors one morning and the daylight refused to come in. [laughter] She came running up to me. "Mister, mister, help me. "I had two quarters in my hand "and a little boy snatched one of my quarters "and run down the street with it "and left me one quarter." I said, "Honey don't tell me, "why don't you tell the police?" She said, "I did tell the police." I said, "Young lady, you called them?" I said, "How did you call the police?" She looked like this. "Police, police, police." I said, "Hell, can't you holler no louder than that?" She said no, so I snatched that other quarter and run with it. [applause] I was out with a young lady the other night, you know. And she looked at me and said, "Rudy, Rudy, Rudy, Rudy, Rudy. "I know you're trying to hit on me, "but I'm going to screw you tonight "until you are gently satisfied, "and I'm not going to charge you na'an nickel. "But all you've got to do is buy me "a pair of shoes." I said, "Well, god damn. "I can always give up a pair of shoes "for a good piece of ass any day." I aint lying. I got on this piece of ass and I rode it from Amazing Grace to Float and Opportunity Base. [laughter] I rode it til I got tired. Then I got dressed and started to walk out the door, and she started hollering at me, "Oh Rudy, Rudy, Rudy, where is the money for my shoes?" I looked at her, I said, "Bitch, "good as you can screw barefooted, "you don't need no motherfucking shoes." [applause] A lot of people are rapping today. But when it comes down to rapping, I was through with it before the rest of them knew what to do with it. [applause] So now, ladies and gentlemen, I will do my classic, Dolemite.

[applause] Lady found her husband outside in the barn, fucking a cow. She looked him, said, "Why you dirty motherfucker." Said, "My hot pussy laying up here in the bed "and you out here fucking this goddamn cow." She said, "I'm going to church this morning "and I'm gonna tell everybody that you were out here "fucking a cow." He said, "Yeah, bitch, if you do, "I'll tell them which one of you got the best pussy." [applause] I aint lying. When I say eat out more often, eating aint cheating. No one knows where the nose goes when the door's closed. Everyone kneeling don't be praying. Remember, if they got it in their hips, you can damn sure get it in the lips. Look at this motherfucker sitting there. Look just like my old dumb brother. My brother ate so much pussy, we raised him up one night, he looked like a glazed donut about the mouth. I aint lying. Now, you know they got the prince and princesses done married now. You know, in England. That's what they call the Royal Fuck. Compute it, baby. You can just imagine the prince looking at the princess. He says, "Alright. Would you pass me the pussy over?" And then, after she pushes the pussy over, he says, "Alright, I say, should we have a go at it?" She'll, say "Well, honey, I don't mind if we do." He will be in the bed fucking English style, with that little piece of meat about to fall out on it. And then, he'll look at her. He said [gasps], "I say. "I think I'm about to arrive." But soul brothers don't do it like that. When a soul brother gets ready to bust his nuts, he says, "Alright, baby, hold on, I'm coming." I aint lying. That's some good shit I'm telling you. [applause] Ya'll don't have to give me the claps. Give them to some other motherfucker. I aint going nowhere. Yeah, this happened to a brother. He was a preacher, a missionary, and he went over to Africa, you know. And he got across to one of those jungle desserts. And a lion started to chase him and he started running, boogedy, boogedy, boogedy. He couldn't outrun the lying. So he got on down on his knees and begin to pray. He said, "Lord have mercy, oh please, help me." And the lion caught up with him and kneeled right down beside of him. And the lion said, "Lord have mercy." And the reverend said, "Oh thank you, thank you, "thank you. "I didn't know that lions prayed." The lion said, "Reverend, you're praying "but I'm saying grace, "'cause I'm getting ready to eat your black ass." [laughter] [applause] I aint lying. As you all know, you can remember a few seasons ago, a man come to you and he had these words that went something like this. "My fellow Americans, "and not you fucking niggers. "Not a one of you niggers voted for me "but I made it to the White House anyway. "It has been said that I, Tricky Dick, "is trying to be a dictator. "Well, you're right. "I did the dicking and you sons of bitches "surely did the taking." [laughter] So I'm telling you brother and sisters do not make that mistake again. I'm telling you on your next presidential election, vote for a righteous candidate. Vote for Dolemite to be your president. [applause] I will not promise you a chicken in every pot. I will not promise to make every motherfucking thing perfectly clear. I will not promise to come to you with no heavy heart. If you all elect me for your president, I will not promise you a goddamn thing. [applause] Because that's just what you will get. Nothing, if I win. But I promise you, I will have the Constitution that will legalize prostitution. You can bet your sweet ass I will legalize grass. I aint lying. Now, a lot of people want to know and want to ask me a lot of questions about how I will do on my presidential format. Now, I'll tell you brothers right now, before I go any further. If I get in the White House and we take over, brothers and sisters, we are not going to kill all the whites. [laughter] We'll need workers. [laughter] We'll need somebody to harvest the melons and clean the chit'lings. [applause] Wash them, please. [distant female voice] Yes, sir. [distant female voice] Yes, ma'am, I mean. Ask that question again. - How do you stand on marijuana? - How do I stand on marijuana? Very high, baby, very high. [laughter] [applause] Next question, please. [distant speech] Yes, sir. - [Male Voice] How do you stand on foreign aid? - How do I stand on foreign aid? Now aint that a bitch. How would you like to feed some other motherfucker before you feed yourself? [laughter] Next question, please. Look at this little simple motherfucker there. [laughter] If I get to be president, I'm gonna put your ass in the army. Come up here. [laughter] Aint this a bitch. Turn around. Let people see your ass. You're one ugly motherfucker, honestly. [laughter] Hold your head up. Standing up here with these motherfucking Coke bottle glasses. [laughter] Yeah, I'm gonna put your ass in the army, because you look like good army material. - You can't put me in the army. - I can't put you in the army, why? - Because one of my legs is shorter than the other. - Well, don't worry about it. Where you're going, the ground aint level no way. [laughter] Next question, please. - Dolemite. If I had a green bottle in my right hand and a green bottle in my left hand, what would I have? - You'd have the Jolly Green Giant in a hell of a fix, nigga. [laughter] Next question, please. - Mr. Dolemite. What are you going to do about birth control? I have 12 babies and one on the way. - Look at this big, fat, burly motherfucker over there. I bet you aint seen your dick in 10 years. [laughter] Next question, please. - [Female Voice] Mr. Dolemite. - Yes. - If you become president, what are you going to do for employment? - What am I going to do about unemployment? Nothing, baby. I'm gonna legalize stealing. Can you dig it? Next question. Come up here, darling. You come up here. I aint lying. [crosstalk] What's your question, darling? - Mr. Dolemite. - Yes, dear. - If you become president, what will I gain? - Darling, I'll let you get away with a hijacking if you pilot a plane, can you dig it? [laughter] You're the type of lady that I like. I don't like young girls. You know why? - Why? - They always broke and begging. [laughter] I like ladies like you that will come to me with their pocketbooks wide open, dig it? - You can come and see me some time. - Alright, go on back there, darling. Next question, please. Yes. - Mr. Dolemite, I'm 18 years old. Am I a man? - Are you a man? Aint that about a bitch. [laughter] You 18 years old and don't know what you are? [laughter] You're gonna have to figure out the best way you can, son. [laughter] Girl, this could be a virgin boy. [laughter] I aint lying. I'm looking for me a nice, skinny gal tonight. But if I can't find it, a nice juicy, fat butt boy [laughing]. [laughter] - Mr. Dolemite. - Yes, ma'am. - How do you stand on free love? - I don't stand on it, I lay on it baby. Can you dig it? [applause] - Why did you throw your wife out the window? - I felt like I wanted to pitch a bitch. [applause] Next question. [distant speech] - Nigga, when you address me, say Mr. Dolemite. - Excuse me, Mr. Dolemite. How come your dog throws up his legs when he's ready to piss? - to knock his ass out of gear, to keep from shitting, baby. Can you dig it? I aint lying. [laughter] Yeah, lady. Question, lady. - Mr. Dolemite. I just want to know one thing. How do you keep flies out of your kitchen? - Put a bucket of shit in your living room, baby. [applause] - [Male Voice] Mr. Dolemite. - Yes, sir. [distant speech] You can't even ask the question. [laughter] Now ask it again. I don't know what the fuck you said. - [Male Voice] What are you going to do about all this air pollution? - Air pollution? Stick a cork up your ass when you get ready to fart. That will help the solution. - Mr. Dolemite. - [Rudy] Yes. - Mr. Dolemite, can you give me your definition on sex? - My definition on sex? - [Female Voice] Yes. - Baby, sex is just like putting money in the bank. Once you take it out, the interest is all gone. [laughter] Ladies and gentlemen, but if I get to be president, I'm gonna make everything down and funky. I'll even have a permanent cure for all junkies. So put Dolemite in the White House. If Elizabeth won England, I can damn sure run America. Brothers and sisters, this ends my first show. I will be back in no time at all. I've got to leave these messages with you. Be what you are. Be the very best of what you are. Reach out for the moon, but if you miss it, cling to a star. I am what I am and I'm going to be the very best of what I am, and for those who don't like it, confidentially, I don't give a damn. Because I'd rather be hated for what I am, than to be loved for what I'm not. [applause] - [Female Voice] Now, ladies and gentlemen, we have a comedy of team. Come on out here! - [Male Voice] Hey Leroy, what happened to that big, fat belly you had? - It's wasn't belly, sir. It was a baby elephant. You wanna hold his trunk? [applause] Sitting back there, doing all that talking. I recognize your voice. You sound like a truck driver. - [Male Voice] I am a truck driver. - Back up and get this load. [laughter] I seen an old man, about 85 years old. These old men is something else. Went to bed with a young girl about 20 years old. Got in that bed with her around 12 o'clock at night. Hooked his toes at the foot of the bed. And this old man, he started working. Worked around there for about an hour and a half. This young girl got tired of him being up there working like that. And she told him, she said, "Pops, "my goodness you've been up here a long time. "When you gonna come?" Pop said, "I stopped coming 40 years ago. "I'm fucking now." [laughter] I aint lying, really. Boy, this is something else. What the hell is this here coming over here. Gee whiz. Woman, what the hell is you carrying in your arms like that? What is that you got? - This is my baby. - Your baby? - Looking for his daddy. - This yo baby? - That's my baby. - Well, woman, you've got he ugliest damn baby that I've ever seen in my life. - Don't do that, Leroy. - That's an ugly damn baby you've got, woman. - Don't insult me in front of everybody. - Where'd you get that baby at, woman?

Do you understand me? - You aint got no business even talking about me and my baby. Look, honey! Come here and get him. You done disrespected me. - [Man] I am an officer of the law.

I'll make you first in line at the gas station. - I don't need that. - You don't have to worry about that. I'll give you five books with food stamps in them. - [Woman] I don't want no-- - I can do better than that. I can give you a banana for your monkey. [laughter] [applause] - I'd like to mention a few whiskeys, and see if I can hit anybody's special brand. Old Crow. Tollo Taylor. Daddy saw Paul Jones take Lloyd Calvin's daughter, Virginia Dare, out riding on a White Horse, by Cobb's Creek near Green's River and for a Silver Dollar, he laid her Bottom's Up, tickled an Old Drum with Three Feathers, then he pulled out his Jim Beam, which was hard as a Canadian Club. And rammed it in her Crab Orchard. And gave a shot of Cream of Kentucky, and that started the Wilkins family. [laughter] - [Female Voice] Ah shut up, nigger, you aint nobody. - Nobody said nothing to you, lady. Nobody said nothing to you at all. - [Female Voice] I'm talking to you, nigger. - Why in the hell you talking?

Got your hand way up like you suck a little bitty pussy. [laughter] I was at a motel the other night and I heard you over there talking next door. Talking so damn loud, he made me get unready for what I came in there already ready for. I heard him in there tell his woman, "Damn, baby, you sure is dry." She said, "That aint me, fool. "That's the sheet you're licking on." [laughter] [applause] - Here I am, judge. - [Leroy] Judge? Judge? - Here I am. - But I'm not no damn judge. - Yeah, you're the judge.

Let's hear it for Mr. Rudy Ray Moore, with Sex Encounter. Let's give a great, big hand. Come on. [applause] [African drumming] - My, my, my. Yes, yes, yes. This is the kind of girls I dream about. Fine, healthy thing. Oh, just wait. One time, turn around, turn around. Shake what you got. Yes, yes, yes. My, my, my. Ladies and gentlemen, my young ladies as they leave the stage, lets give them a big hand. Aint they out of sight? [applause] Let's give them a big hand. The fabulous Rudettes. Yes, ladies and gentlemen. These are my girls. Aint they out of sight? And now, ladies and gentlemen, I will perform my smash hit, Close Encounters of the Sex Kind. I'm gonna talk to the ladies right now. Ladies, use what you have got to get what you want. You know what that is. That's your pussy. Use it! [laughter] never let your man come home from work and you say, "Daddy, I don't feel well tonight." Drop your drawers at the door if necessary. Pussy poison that motherfucker. Have pussy running all out of his ears. Fuck that motherfucker until he buckles to his knees. Fuck a motherfucker unti he says, "Thank you, ma'am, "I'm pleased, pleased, pleased." Girls, this don't make you less of a lady. This makes you more of a lady because you kept the motherfucker at home. [applause] When you get through wrapping that good, hot pussy all around him, all he gonna be able to do is lay down and go to sleep. There's nothing better than a well-fucked man because he's a satisfied man. So girls, I say fuck him until he's satisfied. Now, girls, as you know, your man when he gets through fucking you, and you don't fuck him well, you know what he's gonna do? Get up off your hot pussy and leave it laying there in the bed and go out with some other bitch. I aint lying. When your man leaves your pussy laying there and go out with some other woman, it means that your pussy aint no goddamn good. Because aint no motherfucker going to leave a T-bone steak to go to Burger King to get a Whopper. Even if you can have it your way. So I tell you to use it. Use it for all it's worth. And when you do decide to give up the pussy, don't just lay there. Ladies, use the grippers in your pussy. You know what grippers I'm talking about. Like when you don't wanna piss on yourself, the grippers. Rang a motherfucker's dick off, with the grippers in your pussy. I'll tell you to grip that motherfucker and turn it a-loose and grip it again. I wanna talk to the fellas right now. Fellas, there's too much good pussy out here today that just aint been used right. Some of you motherfuckers fuck and some of you fucks around. A lot of you fellas will say, "I'm gonna fuck you "all night long. "I'm gonna do you like we did on our wedding night." Girls, don't go for that shit. This motherfucker's gonna offer you one hard, and you know, mama, you've got to get your nuts on that one hard, because if you don't, you can forget it, mama. Because it aint gonna be no seconds. You look at him and you say, "Daddy, "you know what you promised me." He's gonna look at you and say, "Oh gal, "I can't fuck all night. "I've got to get up and go to work in the morning." You know that, so you're going to make a right hand signal and a left hand curve on the dick. And then, he's gonna throw the dick right down the middle. You're gonna say, "Right there, daddy. "Right there, daddy. "Right there, daddy. "Right there, daddy." And by the time you think you're gonna bust your nuts, this motherfucker stop you in the middle of a good fuck to ask you something simple like, "Aint it good, baby? "Don't nobody fuck you like I fuck you, baby? "Aint all this my pussy, baby? "Don't give nobody else my pussy, baby." Shit, you can give it to who in the fuck you want to because this son of a bitch is going to be sleeping. Ladies and gentlemen, I've just performed from my latest record, Close Encounter of a Sex Kind. When I told the fellas there's too much pussy out here that's not being used right, some motherfuckers fuck and some fucks around. So you'll be able to get everything on this album. As I say, go out to your local record store, and buy it. If you do buy it, I wish you good luck. If you don't buy it, I wish you severe chest pains the rest of your life. [laughter] and if that don't hold you, hemorrhoids up on your ass. Buy my shit. I aint lying. Yes, young man got in the bed with his old lady, you know. He fucked her, baby. He know he did a job. He looked at her and said, "Baby was it good?" She said, "No, motherfucker, your dick aint "no god damn good." He said, "Bitch, good as I can fuck you, "you telling me my dick aint no god damn good? "What's wrong with it?" She said, "Motherfucker, it's got too many knots in it." He said, "Bitch, what the fuck you talking about "it's got too many knots in it?" She said, "Motherfucker, it's not big enough, "not long enough and not hard enough." [laughter] This happened, you know... Young lady took her boyfriend out with her the other night. He got in the bed with her, and he looked at her. She looked at him and said, "Baby, "if I had some nuts on the wall, "what would I have?" He said, "Bitch, you would have some walnuts." Said, "Baby, if I had some nuts on my chest, "what would those be?" He said, "Bitch, they'd be chestnuts." She said, "Well, daddy, if I had nuts on my chin, "what would those be? "Chin nuts?" He said, "Hell no, bitch, this time you'd have a dick in your mouth." I aint lying. I got a nice old lady, but she's an ugly chick. I aint lying. She's so damn ugly, she looks like crime in the face. She's just so ugly, she looks like she's been shortstopping alligators. She's just so ugly, she could scare a hungry bulldog off the back of a meat truck. Baby, and cross-eyed. She's so cross-eyed, she can stand on the front porch and count the chickens in the back yard. I aint lying. And her teeth remind me of a 7-Up. She's got seven up and one down. She can't cook either. You ever seen anybody burn Jell-O? I aint lying. She looked at me and said, "Rudy, listen, if I keep cooking for you, "what will I get?" I said you're gonna get my insurance. - Here's Tippy. You know, he went in a pool hall to see one of my brother's babies. You know what, he looked at my brother and said, "Baby, I'd like for you to change "an $18 bill for me." My brother looked at him. "See, well, baby, "how do you want it changed?" "Two nines, three sixes, or six threes?" [laughter] I was down at the bus station the other day. You know, they got these new computerized scales. And this brother run and jumped on the scale and said, "I want to see how this thing works." He put a dime in the scale. The card comes out. It said, "You are a black man." It said, "You weigh 165 pounds "and you are on your way to New York." He said, "Well, I'll be goddamned." So he saw an Indian standing over there. He said, "Indian, come over here. "I want to try this with you." The Indian tipped up on the scale. Brother dropped a dime in there and the card come out. It said, "You are an Indian. "You weigh 159 pounds, and you are on your way "to the reservation." The brother said, "Well, I have heard everything." So he looked at the Indian and said, "Indian, "let me have that blanket a minute." He said, "I want to see if this thing really works." Brother took this blanket and held it over his head, and pulled up like this and tipped back up on the scale again. Pulled a dime out of his pocket and slowly dropped it in the scale. And the card come out. It said, "You are still a black man. "Your weight was 165 pounds. "But since you got that damn shit on, "you weigh 170. "And you was on your way to New York, "but you fucked around with that damn Indian, "and missed your bus." [laughter] I talk about a lot of things. But you know what really makes me mad is a farting motherfucker. And what really makes me made too is some motherfucker farting on a crowded elevator. I was at a hotel the other day on the 30th floor. The elevator making no stops. Coming all the down and some motherfucker farted. And you can always tell who this farting motherfucker is, because everybody else has got their head straight in front of them. And this one farting motherfucker be doing one of these numbers like this. I looked at him and said, "Why you lousy motherfucker." I'm gonna ask if you all will give me the beat one more time.

I met a young lady in a club like this the other night. You know? And she looked at me, she said, "Rudy, I want you to go home with me." I said, "Baby, I don't go home with no women. "I take them to a motel." She said, "Daddy, I aint got no husband. "Come on home with me." I decide to go home with her. You know what happened? When I got home with her and got in the bed and started wailing on that pussy, all at once, I heard a knock on the door. I said, "Bitch, what the fuck is that?" She said, "That's my husband, hide." I said, "Bitch, "how in the hell is anybody gonna hide in one room?" She said, "Nigga, jump out the window." I said, "Woman, look here, "we're on the 13th floor." She said, "Motherfucker, this aint no time "to be superstitious. Jump!" I know damn well, I wasn't gonna jump. So I run and jumped up over the front door seal. Nuts hanging down, black ass out. And this big, burly motherfucker busted through the door, hollering, "Bitch, what the fuck you've been doing? "What the fuck you been doing?" She said, "Nothing, daddy, nothing, daddy." "Then what the fuck is that hanging up over there "on the door seal?" She said, "Daddy, that's some doorbells I bought "down at Sears." He said, "I'm gonna see if I can make these "motherfuckers ring." This son of a bitch went into the closet and got a baseball bat and drew back at my nuts, and I looked down and said, "Ding dong, motherfucker. "Ding dong." [applause] I'm not lying. You know, I can remember when I was going to school. We had a little Italian boy in the class. And the teacher looked at him. Said, "Junior, today I want you to spell "Mississippi." The little Italian boy couldn't help how he talked. Because, you know, there aint no Italians in Mississippi. But he said, "Teacher, I'll try to spell it." So he run to the blackboard and said, "M come first. "And then a I come. "S come twice. "And then I come again. "S come twice more. "And I pee-pee "and I come again." [laughter] Mississippi. [laughter] I aint lying. And we had a little girl in the class. And the teacher said, "Sally, today "for your spelling lesson, "I want you to spell, Peter." Sally said, "Teacher, "I can't spell them old long, hard words like peter. "But I'll try." she said, "P. "P, P." Teacher said, "Girl, get on out of here "and sit down. "You're gonna stay up here and pee all day." They had Lucy in the class. She was the smartest of them all. She said, "Teacher, teacher, teacher. "I can spell it. "P-E-T-E-R, peter, peter, peter. "They don't come too long and hard for me, honey." [laughter] I'd like to talk about the good old days, when I was a little boy. Well, I'm from Mississippi, as you know. And I'm glad to be from there, but I can remember times was hard in Mississippi, baby. Times were so hard, that the Mississippi River didn't run but twice a week. Once up stream, and then again, back downstream. I can remember one year, baby, we had hard times. Our crop didn't come in. I can remember the times were so hard, me and my brother hung our stockings over the mantle picce, and the health department made us take them down. Baby, that Christmas, we didn't get nothing. I said, "Daddy, daddy, daddy, what is Santa "gonna get us for Christmas?" Daddy said, "You know what my daddy did? "Went in the closet and got a rifle and went outside "and shot it up in the air, "and come back in the house and said, 'Kids, Santa just committed suicide.'" We didn't get nothing that Christmas. I aint lying. Baby, times were so hard, me and my brother wore tennis shoes Easter, Indian Summer, New Year, Thanksgiving and Christmas. Baby, we wore tennis shoes so long, until we wore them out up to the name on the ankle. We didn't have to take them off. When we laid down, all we did was just folded them back. I aint lying. Well, but I'm grown up now and I've left home and I go a lot of places and I went to church the other day, and you know what happened when I got in church? The preacher said, "This morning, my brothers and sisters, "we do not have an organ player. "But we're gonna sing the hymns with no music." And a little young man jumped up in the back of the church. He said, "Reverend, "I cannot play organ but I can play piccolo "for your choir to sing." The reverend said, "Oh thank you, young man. "Alright, choir let's turn to hymn number 100." [sobbing while mumbling] "I can't play hymn number 100." The reverend said, "That's alright, son. "Let's turn to hymn number 140, choir." The piccolo player said, "Oh Reverend, "that's a hard one. "I can't play that one either." Somebody in the church said, "That piccolo player is a motherfucker." The reverend said, "I'm not going to have that shit. "Whoever called my piccolo player motherfucker, "stand up." Nobody in the house would stand up. The reverend said, "I want whoever called "my piccolo player to stand up." Nobody would stand up. Finally, a little young man jumped up in the back of the church and said, "Reverend, "I am not the man that called your piccolo player "motherfucker, "and I'm not sitting next to the man "that called your piccolo player motherfucker." He said, "I'm not even sitting next to the man "that's sitting next to the man "that called your piccolo player mothefucker, "but I'd like to know one thing. "Who called this motherfucker a piccolo player."

My outhouse was different than y'alls. You know, y'all used to have that old Sears catalog hanging on the wall. But we had corn cobs in our outhouse. And some of y'all had corn cobbs in your outhouse but we had two sets. I can remember we had a bushel of white corn cobbs in our outhouse. We had a bushel of brown corn cobs in it. First thing you do. You wipe your ass on a brown corn cob. You throw that one away. Then you wipe your ass on a white corn cob to see if you needed another brown one. Two soldiers went to Vietnam. Yes, a brother and a white fella. They come all the way back home. They never got a stitch on them. Never got na'an stitch on them in the army. They went back to Mississippi. The people in Mississippi said, "Fellas, I'm gonna give y'all anything that y'all want." They looked at the white boy and they said, "Young man, what do you want?" He said, "Well, I'll show you what to get for me. "Give me $10,000 and a Lincoln Continental to drive." They said, "Alright, we're going to get that for you." They look at the brother, said, "Brother, "brother, brother. "What would you like?" The brother said, "Well, I'll tell y'all "what y'all get for me. "Give me a dollar and a half "from the head of my dick, down to my balls." They looked at the brother, said, "Brother, brother, brother. "Don't you want no more than that?" The brother said, "No, that's all I want." So he pulled out that old big, long dick, hung damn near down to his knees. They put a dollar and a half down to the end of it. They put another dollar and a half on it. They put another dollar and a half on it and another dollar and a half, and another dollar and a half, and another dollar and a half, and another dollar and a half, another dollar and a half and one fella looked at him and said, "Well, nigger. "Where in the hell is your nuts at?" He said, "In Vietnam." [laughter] [applause] I aint lying. Young man got in the bed with his girlfriend the other night. Baby, he was gone in three minutes just like opium. She said, "Why you no-screwing motherfucker." He said, "Bitch, get up out this bed "and go and fix me some food." She went to the ice box and she brought him one carrot and a head of lettuce. He looked at her and said, "Bitch, "why in the fuck did you bring me "a carrot and a head of lettuce out here?" She looked at him and said, "Motherfucker, "you fuck like a rabbit. "You might as well eat like one." [laughter] I aint lying. That's some good shit I'm telling you. This is one called The Bulldikers. I think I'll pack my suitcase and move on, fella. Because these rotten ass bitches has gone to fucking one another. These bitches is drawing up a plan.

And there was a white lady sitting on the bus, you know. And she had some sweet smelling perfume on. And a black lady got on the bus and sit down beside of her and said, "Oh honey, what in the world is that sweet smelling perfume "I smell?" Little white lady looked there and said, "Black Knight, black bitch. "100 dollars an ounce." Oh, this made the black lady mad. The bus eased on down the street, and all at once, the black lady let out one of them cornbread, cotton-picking farts. [imitates fart] Little white lady said, "Oh my god, "what is that terrible smell I smell?" The black lady said, "White beans, white bitch. "15 cents a pound." [laughter] I aint lying. [laughter] My, my, my, my, my. Where in the fuck did you come from? That's one ugly motherfucker, I aint lying. Baby, this motherfucker so ugly, he can scare the stink out of shit. [laughter] He's so ugly, when he was born, his mother put him in a corner and had to feed him with a goddamn slingshot. [laughter] He's so goddamn ugly, they gave him a job standing outside of doctor's office making people sick. [laughter] [distant speech] Now, that's the kind of nigga that always wants to get in the show. Ladies and gentlemen, look at this motherfucker over here. That's the kind of nigga that will fart in a bathtub and turn around and bite the fucking bubbles. [laughter] Since you know so much, bring your ass up here. Aint that a bitch. [shouting unintelligibly] Well, our president, Mr. Reagan, said he's gonna give all niggas a job. He's gonna build car washes 7000 miles long. - I don't want no car wash job man. - Well, I only have one other job. - What is it? - Putting dick rubbers on roosters and milking hens. - You're crazy. - That'll hold his ass alright. [laughter] Yeah, I went out with a young lady the other night. You know, at my age, I can't get ready so quick. So she looked at me and said, "Daddy, "daddy, I'm hot. "Do something quick." You know what I thought about? One finger. I stuck that finger up in there. Got that finger up in there and she says [gasps], "Oh daddy. "Oh daddy! "Oh daddy. "Oh, your ring is hurting." I said, "That ain't my ring, that's my watch, bitch." [laughter] I aint lying. Same old hand joke. I got another young lady. I couldn't get ready for her. I tried that same shit. I stuck that finger up in there. And you know what she said to me? "Daddy, daddy. "I got some more room. "Stick another finger up in it." said, "Daddy, I got a little bit more room. "Stick another finger up in it." She said, "Daddy, since you've got some more room, "stick your whole hand in it." I got one hand in there. She said, "Oh daddy, oh daddy. "Stick your other hand up in there." And after I got both hands up in there, she said now clap them. I said, "I can't." She said, "I told you I got tight pussy, didn't I?" [laughter] I aint lying. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm filmed live in the concert Eat Out More Often. A lot of people say, "Rudy Ray Moore "is like Pryor." But they're a goddamn lie. I'm not gonna be like Pryor and set my ass on fire. [laughter] Some learn and some burn. If I ever decide to freebase, I'm gonna build me a house next door to the Mississippi River. If I catch on fire, I'm gonna run and jump dead into that motherfucker. [laughter] Yes. Dolemite is my name. And rapping and tapping is my game. I'm the one that took the rock that killed the giant Goliath and whipped Nero's ass for setting Rome on fire. That's right, baby. I'm a rare specimen of man, don't you agree? The stars, the sun, the moon refuse to shine without first consulting me. I'm the bad motherfucker that roams the meadow. When I fart, I change the weather. When I shit, I whither the grass. The whole world trembles when I shake my ass. Dolemite. Dolemite. Dolemite. Dolemite. [applause] [funk music]
