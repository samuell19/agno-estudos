I was dead. That's what the doctor told me. Legally dead he called it. I don't know what illegally dead is, but legally? I was dead as a duck, down in Arnaudville. So when I woke up, I was soaking wet from head to toe. And there he was, standing over me. Praying. That man, he brought me back to life. And that, I know ma'am. He brought me right here, back to life. Shit. You getting out or what? Hey, you think you could uhm, make the block a few times? Till some more people show? Don't think it's startin' yet. Whatever. Fine, just stick around a few minutes all right? - Huh? - Whatever. Hey! - Seriously. - I love you guys, you don't have to thank me... - What? - What is she doing here? - Gal? - Hey, look, I know I'm early... You're late. - It says two. - What day is it? - It's Saturday. - Sunday. - No it's Saturday, I... - We had his party yesterday, Saturday. Is he here? Did he... - Are you high? - You should take down those balloons... Did you seriously show up to our son's birthday party high? No, there's no party remember? Despite all the balloons outside, is he here, I... - I have something for him. - I don't think it's a good idea. Shi... Gal, look at me. I'm just gonna give him this present and go, alright? Gal? What's going on? Found it. We haven't seen you in months and now all of the sudden... You know you're short last month? 80 bucks. - I ain't trying to get Social Services back over here. - Here is, 14, you happy? What are we supposed to buy with that? Just hang on, just, I'm sorry, just hang on. Is that 80 bucks worth? No, no, no, no. Please. Okay, okay. Just, stay here, I'll see if I can settle him down okay? - It doesn't matter. - Yes it does! - She's his mother. - She doesn't act like a mother. - I'm more of a mother. - I know but he needs to know her. Why? So he can be heartbroken all over again? - Can't you relax for one second? - No, I'm the one that deals with this shit when she comes around. Stop freaking out. It's not about that! She doesn't deserve to see him if she comes here a day after the birthday... Jesus Christ! - What? - Uh, Gal? - Pop? - Yeah, this your Pop. Look, Gal, uhm, something happened to your Maw. You need to come home. Don't make this about you, Gal. Something happened to your Maw, she needs you, come home. Richard, don't know how to thank you for bringing me my precious little Gal. - How was the fishing today? - Bad. Maybe I can make something up for you to say thank you for, you know, your troubles. - Something for that jock itch? - It's okay, oh you got the yellow stuff? Yeah, I got the yellow stuff, I'll be right back. Don't use too much of this huh, half a table spoon twice a day, with some hot water. I'ma just be a couple of minutes, can you wait for me? He got a boat. Thought he would never leave. Come on, come inside, I'll make you something that'll make you feel better. You'll never guess who come by here last night. The damned ol' Rougarou! You remember him? How he used to sneak up through the cypress knees, hide there until little girl's coming by, then he'd jump out and he'd snatch her and he'd take her back into the swamp! Yeah, that same Rougarou. He come right up on the porch last night. That cheeky son of a bitch. He's up there looking to see if we had any chickens. He kept going on and on about prodigal daughters, and their kindly good lookin' daddies. What is that? You don't trust your old Pop? Well? It's a little heavy on the citronella, huh? Well, you need that. That's the secret. And that old Rougarou, that swamp monster, that's the other secret, huh? Good thing I got my Rougarou stick here. - Pop, you all right? - Yeah, yeah, tip-top. You taking good care of yourself? The best. Are you still taking your pills and stuff? You still taking yours? What happened to Maw? Hmm? Gal... Your Maw... She went last night. Real quiet in her sleep, real peaceful. Well... She at peace finally, your Maw. That's the important thing. God bless her. Pop that's not how Maw died. Maw didn't die last night. And she sure as shit didn't go peacefully. You hold on just a second there. Maw died three years ago, I would know, I was there. You're wrong, she here. Pop. Pop, look... What the fuck, Pop? You, I, what... Okay, okay, oh, nah-ah-ah-ah. Fuck that! Pop, who is that? I gotta get a few more things together and then we can get started. Get started with what? Moving the houseboat. Move? Moving it where? We're going to bury your mother, Gal. That, that's not my mother. It's what she wanted. To be buried in the family plot. It's just a couple days journey across the Basin. Pop, who is that? We gonna do what's right. She got a right, Gal, to have her family there, and that means the both of us. I don't know what you got going on there, but I'm, I ain't being a part of it. Nope! Fine, I'll take you back in the landing in the morning. No I, I ain't sleeping here. - I am not sleeping here. - Yeah, well this boat is, and it goes to bed early, so you'd better start swimming. Pop? Why do you look so alive? - Hello? - Shit... Oh, my God, look who it is! Goodness gracious, Gal! God, is that really you? Hey, uh, Warden. Is it now? Oh, yeah, agent of the law I guess. How things change, am I right? - Yeah. - Old man around? - No he's actually... - McGees, - McGees Landing. - What? That's it. Last time I saw you, you were in the back of my truck at McGees Landing with my little brother T-boy. He's still around, you ought to give him a call. Yeah, I don't know, maybe. I mean you're not, one of them, you know... I heard you got locked up a little while. I know how it goes in there. But you're not... I mean, T-boy's a great guy if that's what you're looking for. You said you needed something from my dad? Right. Yeah, I just wanted to touch base with... Can I come in? I know he ain't been doing too good lately. So I figure I'd stop by, you know. Yeah, nah, I'll appreciate it, he's gonna be a while though, he's probably at church or something, you know him. Oh, yeah, we all know him. How's he look, he doing okay? Yeah, yeah, he's fine, he's, why? Oh, you know, you hear things. I... Well, I mean, what kind of things? Look. I consider myself a good Catholic boy. I just can't buy into false prophets and such. That fella 20 years ago they say he resurrected, I just can't. And I suppose, after what he did to your Maw - a few years back. - Well, he didn't do anything to my mom. Well, we both know that ain't true. The only miracle is he didn't go to prison for drowning her. I'm sorry I'm a jackass I didn't mean to bring all that up. Look, I just wanna ask him a few questions. About what? He mentioned anything or anybody I don't know, - out of the ordinary around here? - How? A young guy for one. Guy, no. He hasn't seen any guys. So a girl then? No, he hasn't seen any... no. He told you that? - Wh... What? - He told you he hasn't seen anybody? Well... I mean, it's fine, it's fine. Just seems like a weird point of conversation. Hey, Gal, I'm out of sugar, the faucet's leaky and I ain't seen nobody, how you doing? I guess it is, yeah. Anyway. Following up a report on a woman who jumped off a bridge, some good ol' boy called it in. No ID. But it looks like she caught a flat, decided to change it, and had a change of heart. Decided to take a swan dive. No, no. Stop. - It's okay, it's okay. - No. - I'm just here to help. - No! It's fine, it's fine. Stop... Your pa isn't coming back for a while but, it'd be cool if he comes back soon too. You know, I'm just here to help. Seeing how we go back a while and all. What'd they do to you in there, hon? Ah, hey there, Warden, I thought I recognized your boat. Uh, yeah, it's me. Oh, sorry about the noise, but as I was pulling up there was a, a big old woodie buzzing around. Didn't want him thinking that he could just come around here anytime he wanted and started pecking. So I fired off a warning shot. Nowhere near him, but maybe next time I shoot him. Right. Well, uh... - I guess I ought to be going. - You wanna stay for a snack? My Gal know how to carve up a sausage real good. Thanks, I gotta uh, I gotta hit it. Looks like your boat's awake now. I'm ready to go back. So maybe I was thinking you could stay a little bit, maybe, you know, for lunch. No, I gotta go. So anyways I was uhm, I was hoping maybe you would let me you know, maybe help you out a little bit, with my little grandson. I mean, uh, it's not much money, but uhm... Uh... Uh, I probably put it in the cookie jar. That son of a bitch Warden. I knew that bastard was over here for no good. - Pop. Pop! - What? Here. Keep it, I was gonna give it to you anyway. Come on, I'll take you back now. Pop, Pop! Pop, Percy got bit by a snake! Yeah, yeah, yeah, go, go, go, go, go, go! Please grab my bag. Grab my bag! Alright... Hey, Pop. Was a cottonmouth. Walked up right on him. I see. Peepaw okay, alright baby? Peepaw gonna be okay, baby... Oh, baby... Calm down, calm down. Shh, shh, shh, stay there, baby, you stay there. Percy, oh baby. Pop! Let go off her! Stop! Ssshht, ssshht, ssshht! Pop! Don't, he needs a doctor, Pop! - Merci. - You're okay. Merci. I'm okay, I'm okay... Hey. You okay? You're learning from the best, cher. To heal. You have it in you too, I can see it. - No, I'm just his daughter. - Well, that's your luck, that's what they say right? Gets passed down the family, woman to man, man to woman. For you. It's a hundred-year-old cypress. It too is a gift. Watch your step. Hey get your jacket on it's cold outside. - Merci beaucoup. - Bae, you're not supposed to say thank you. There she go the boss. Okay. I need to go. Can I fix you something? No, I just, I lay down a minute I'll be good-good. Ah, no, no, no, cut it, cut it! Gal, cut it, cut it, you're gonna burn the motor. Hey, cut it! Cut it, you're gonna burn it up! - I got the what? - Cut it, cut it! You're gonna burn it up! Sorry... Okay, give it a shot. No, I've done enough I think. You all right? Tip-top. Alright. Allons. Right there. Now you twist that son-of-a-gun till she's tight-tight. Yeah, that's good. Watch your hands, I got the trim. Maybe we can borrow Richard's flat-bottom, - we can figure out how to get him back out here. - No, Pop. You don't just go trawling around the basin with a dead body. Okay then, you're the boss I guess. Time to get back to work. But if it's not the spark plug then I don't... You've been going to church? It's been a minute. Any reason? Nah, not really. Reach in the toolbox. Yeah, what you need? You remember what a Phillips head look like? That's the one that got a little cross on the tip. So what happened? What? You just woke up one morning and, you don't believe? You can believe without going to church. So you do? You know, Pop, not believing or not knowing, it's not a bad thing, it's fine. Well, it's a sad thing, don't you think? - Well, here you are. - And what's that mean? I mean, no offense, Pop, but, belief has got you exactly this far, you know, you stuck out hiding in the middle of nowhere. And a lotta good it did Maw. What made you believe you could... Alright don't bullshit me, what happened yesterday? That man with the snakebite? What you think happened? But it doesn't work every time, right? Allons. Come on, you take over. - Pull the spark plug. - Pop, we did that. Just pull the spark plug. Take the cap off of it, number one. And twist it. Okay, give it here. Oh, well, there it is right there, ah. Yeah, just needs a little love. Come on, you too. Go on. Well, you got to put it back in. Tight-tight. Put the cap back on. Pop, I mean, we did all this already. Go ahead. What'd you do? You got to have a little faith. So that's where God's been all this time, fixing boat motors? Well, it never hurts to offer up a Hail Mary. Allons, we got to start moving the houseboat. Alright. How much longer? If we leave by sun up, we should be there by afternoon. You know you don't have to stay here. You can go back home. This is my home, Gal. Besides I get better reception out here in case the big guy need to give me a call. I don't feel right about it. You keep that and maybe use it with that little fella of yours. I don't need your money. What I'm gonna do with it out here? Well, maybe you could use it if you decided to go back. Just take it, come on. I don't see him too much anyway. He's got a new mama now, and one's plenty. - Now, Gal, you ask me... - No, I didn't, I didn't. But it seem to me that you need to be in that little boy's life. A mother's place is beside her child. I think maybe that little boy might be able to bring you some happiness. Maybe if you could find a little happiness, you wouldn't need that junk. Hold on. I don't want you ending up like me. You got no idea what's it like for your child to drift away. That's exactly what I'm trying to avoid. You're doing a lousy job because you got nothing right now. Yeah, and nothing to lose. You know, most people that got nothing to lose, they sack it up, they sack up and they do better! It wasn't easy giving him up like that you know. I know what you think. I could just quit, like I took the easy way out. Well, it's not easy knowing he's out there making friends and learning to ride a bike and, he's turning into somebody I'm never gonna know. I can imagine it is... No, you can't, you can't! Because you kept me, us, me and Maw, you held onto us so fucking tight. You got to see it all for yourself. And you know what I got out of it? I got to see you passed out on the bathroom floor on my fifth birthday. Yeah, I'm sure seven-year-old dreams of watching from the back seat as her father gets arrested for a DUI. But people change. I don't know maybe you got Born Again or something after you dried out. But it sure as shit doesn't mean you had any business being a father back then. Pop? - Gal, I don't... - No, Pop. Come see. He's dead... Should we put him inside? Well, I guess we can put him in the same room with you. Alright just cover him. Maybe we can move him inside after we bury your Maw. Allons, we gotta start even earlier tomorrow. Mmm... I'm watching you. You sir, have a spectacular collection of crap. And I really do mean that in the nicest way possible. So what is all this stuff? Yeah, that one there uhm, that come from a one-eyed chicken, name of Steve. The ugliest chicken I ever seen but, she sure can... She sure can lay a perfect egg. Yeah. Help her owner out. She had some sunstroke. You heal people? Oh, no, no, uhm, God used me sometimes. So y'all, y'all live around here? Yep, round about. You? Oh, nah. I'm just passing through. Y'all headed somewhere? We're going bury my wife. Oh, I'm sorry. It was her time I think. She had a long hard road the last couple of years. But she's at peace now. She's here? Yeah, she's in the back room. Pop, hey, uhm, can I talk to you for a second? Yeah, I lost my wife too. I'm sorry. Oh, I was never there, was always on a rig, 14 on, 14 off, you know? And she's doing it all by herself. Just taking care of our baby. I tried to tell her it wasn't her fault. I don't think that's something she really wanted to hear, you know? Any... Yeah, anyway... uh, we catch a flat on the bridge of all places, so I take to changing it, and you know, and I look up and uh... she's standing on the edge. Then she stepped off. And I thought maybe, maybe in that instant, she found the answer to why she couldn't let go. To why she couldn't accept that our baby... That our baby was gone. I thought that's, that sounds like a good idea to me. So I followed after her. I miss her. You salvagers haven't found any other bodies floating around here, have y'all? No. Come on, Gal... We need to start moving. Sorry. Hey. Can we talk? Can we talk? Looks like we doin' it. Right, so, what you think? - What do I think about what? - His story. I just wonder what happened to his wife. I'm wondering if you might've seen her, his wife I mean. Well, I think I'd remember that don't you? Right. We got a long trip today, Gal, maybe you should just go make some coffee while I handle this. How are you feeling? I was just about to ask you the same question. Did you fall off a bridge too? Sorry 'bout your mom. I know you're probably just trying to be strong for him, but deep down, it must be hard. Yeah. Yeah, it was hard... It is hard. Yeah, I know the feeling. Can you still walk? - No, yeah, I don't want... - Come on. Just, please. Sarah? Sarah. Sarah. Sarah. Wake up, baby. Sarah. What's wrong with her? Sarah, wake up, honey. Sarah, wake up. Sarah, wake, wake up, Sarah. - I'm sorry. - Why are you sorry, why are you sorry, what's wrong with her? What's wrong, Sarah? Sarah, wake up, Sarah, wake up! - Get away from... - Sarah, wake up! Wake up, baby, please, wake up. - What the hell is he doing? - Sarah. - Just let him... - Stop it. - Pop, please don't. - You stop it right now. - Hey! - Pop, come on. - Hey! - Please, get up! Hey get off of her! Get over here, get up! - Pop! Come on he's hurt. - No, he's a liar! - He's hurt. - He's a liar! He gets off this boat now! You gotta stop it now! - He's a liar! - Stop! I'm sorry it isn't Maw, I'm so sorry, I wish it was Maw, but it's not, alright? It's not her! You don't know, you don't know, you don't know! You could help this man, you could help him. That body's been in there for, what, four or five days now? I know what this is. You can do it. You could bring this woman back, you did it before. This woman? Maw, it's Maw, you're right, it's Maw. And you can bring her back, Pop. No, no I have, I have to say goodbye, right? It's time I have to say goodbye, I... I failed her last time I... Are you all right? Are you all right, are you all right? Why does she look like that? Why does she look so alive? Uhm, uhm, uhm, uhm, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Yeah, me too. Thank you. For keeping her safe. For letting me see her one last time. I'd like your help. Pop, hey. Come on. What are you doing, you're not gonna at least try? What? You were right, Gal, it's not your Maw. Alright. Where is it? - Gal, Gal. - Give it to me. - I'm gonna do it myself. - Gal! Come on. Come on! Come on! - It's not working. - Hey, hey, look at me, look. Look, look, hush, shh. You don't tell God, you ask God. Now put your hand in the water. Now on her. Again. And again. Ask God to use you. Sometimes his answer is no. No matter how much you want it. I'm sorry. We should probably get you to the hospital or something. Nah, this is it for me. I spent most of my life away from her. So I'd like to start the next one right here with her. Go. So? You'll be alright. So where are you gonna roam off to next? Well, I don't know. Mitch said I could tie up here anytime I want. It's nice. Hmm-mm, you think? I think maybe it's a little cramped. A little cramped is not so bad, you should see my place. Okay. Oh, yeah? Yeah, that sounds nice. Alright. I gotta go see about a ride. - Yeah, okay. - Alright. - Gal? - Yeah? Pop, I don't want your money. Thank you. Mais, you're not supposed to say thank you. Um... I love you. Yeah... - Hey. - Hey yourself. Um... This ought to cover last month's too. Thanks. Yeah. Hey, uh, can you come inside, say hi? Uh, I don't think it's a good idea right now. - You sure? - Next time. Yeah, okay. - Alright. - See ya then. Yeah.
