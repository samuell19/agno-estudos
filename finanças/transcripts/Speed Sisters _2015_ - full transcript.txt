I want the whole world to know there’s a girl called Marah Zahalka representing Palestine. I don’t race for the cup or trophies. It’s an energy inside that I need to release. Racing’s in my blood. I grew up in a family of racers. All men and women racers, please come to the starting line. If you don’t join us, it’s your problem. We’re reviewing and adjusting some things. After announcing the results, you can’t object to classification or timing. If you have an objection, submit it in writing and pay 100 dinars. Is that clear? These are the rules we gave everyone. If you didn’t read them, it’s your problem. It’s not common to see girls racing anywhere in the world. Pay attention when the car takes off. Concentrate on the next car. Imagine you’re driving, and how it will spin. We’re the first women’s racing team in the Arab world. We’re teammates and we compete against the guys. At the same time, we compete for the title of fastest woman. The top two women will race in Aqaba at the end of the year. Racing’s in my blood. I’ve loved cars since I was little. I love watching them. I’ve loved the sound since I was little. I’ve been a driving instructor since Marah was 10. She always wanted to ride along with me to see how I teach, how I hold the wheel. I’d hold the steering wheel, but I couldn’t even see. She was afraid to give me the car. When she went next door, I called the neighborhood kids to come push the car. I noticed her talent the day she stole the car at 11 years old. It was clear she’s different. I went outside and the car was gone. Marah started it and drove off. They pushed me in the car until we got past my house, so Mom wouldn’t hear the engine. I couldn’t get it into second gear, so I drove through the whole neighborhood in first. I burnt the engine! There’s pink paint, but yellow will look nicer. -No, not pink. -Or there’s green, how about neon? How about this color? Blue? Because of racing, our life has changed completely. For myself, her dad, her brothers, for all of us. It’s a beautiful new world and we’re very happy and comfortable. My parents give me everything they have. So at every race, I feel a need to get better scores because it makes them so happy. Before, you could see the other side of the road. We would stop and do some shopping. It was one street. They divided the street with the wall. Now each side belongs to different authorities with different laws. Without the checkpoints, it usually took me 15 minutes maximum. But now, if there are a lot of thorough searches, any problems or traffic, it can take an hour and a half. The smell of tear gas reminds me of my childhood. During the first and second intifadah, on the way to school, both going and coming back, we’d breathe it. I love you. Nothing can change that. But people are talking. They say, “Tell your granddaughters to cover their hair.” It doesn’t matter what people say. What do you think? I love you. The other way around. That’s right. Put it down like this. This part comes this way. No, like this. Down and to the front. That goes to the front? -Give it to me. -That’s it. My mom and dad worry about us a lot. Especially me, the girl. Since I was little, I was always a leader among my classmates. When I got involved in activities after school, my parents stopped it. I had to come directly home after school. No other activities were allowed. In a conservative Arab family, when you say, “I want to race cars.” They’ll say: “What are you talking about?” The refugee camp starts here and goes all the way to the end. My whole family lives in this neighborhood. Let’s go inside. My family is originally from near Haifa. My grandfather’s house is still there, but it’s abandoned. They were expelled from their town in the 1948 war and came to live in the West Bank. To this day, we’re still refugees. Dad! -Hello! -Hi, how are you? Shame on your father. I miss you! Hi, Dad. This was our room. All nine of us slept in this room. It rained a lot. We put buckets here where it leaked. Another there and another one there. They were all smart at school. All my children were in the top of their class. For a girl to go racing in Amman, it’s unheard of. She’s the first one to do something like this. We wish she’d study to become a doctor and work in a respectable field. She’s doing very well in her studies. We want her to have a clinic and be respected. She’s already respected, even in London. “Champion of Palestine.” But we don’t want her to be known for that. We want her to learn science or something of value. -Do you support her or not? -It’s too late. She can do whatever she wants. It’s done. But I wouldn’t have let her do it to begin with. At the first race, everybody was against it. They said, “It’s a disgrace. What you’re doing is wrong.” I told them I’d support her so she could do whatever she wanted. I was deprived of a lot of things. I had a difficult life. I want my kids to have the complete opposite. I’m working as hard as I can to earn as much as possible so I can support her financially and fix her car so she can reach the top. This car is a regular car. Her mom uses it to give driving lessons. It’s not a race car, but it’s what we have. So I have to remove as much weight as possible. From the rear door, I removed the window, the wiper pump and the extra steel to make the car lighter. Why? To make it faster. Jenin has been through really hard times. For a period, we lived under a 24-hour curfew. The army only allowed us two hours to shop for bread and water. It was really tough. But what are we supposed to do? Stop living? No. Life must go on. -What’s up? -How are you? See, I covered up. Everyone said, “Cover up when you’re in Jenin!” No, you don’t have to worry about that. Just be yourself. “Everyone said, ‘Cover up when you’re in Jenin!’” She means we’re backwards. It’s like a U-turn, then off you go. Try it on your own. Tell me if you need me. Forget the map. -Noor can’t take directions. -She can’t focus. I walked the track with her, but she wants to do it herself. Three, two, one. Noor! Go get her. When the race ends and they announce Marah as the winner, as happy as we are, what matters most to Marah is that the people of Jenin and the refugee camp are proud. Look out and watch, Jenin is on its way! It’s a big responsibility. People count on me to represent Jenin with a high score. And the prize for fastest woman driver goes to the champion, Marah Zahalka! I love this trophy so much. It’s not related to the other trophies. It’s completely different. My dad gave me this. He made it himself. He got the base, and he got this part separately. He also got the car, welded it by hand. It’s very meaningful and symbolic to me. The car is on top of the cup. It’s not a championship trophy. Just a gift from my dad. I was born in Mexico. Spanish is my first language. So I feel Palestinian and Latina at the same time. I’m very competitive. My mom wanted me to be special in everything, beauty, manners, school, education and racing, to always be the best. -What did you hit? -Another car. Head-on collision. -And the other car? -Like this, maybe not as bad. Really? This isn’t her first accident. It’s her fourth! It’s my specialty. At first, it was strange for us to see a girl racing, because it was still a new sport here. It started here in 2005, -and you, Mona, joined us in 2006. -Right. But by her second race, the guys started to get used to it. And it was cool. I don’t have a hand brake. I’m just driving with no hand brake. -Watch. -Forget the hand brake. Forget about the hand brake, use the clutch and the steering wheel. We have difficulty training because there aren’t places to practice. The areas are very few and limited. We’ve searched a lot and found an empty lot where the municipality lets us train. It’s close to the Israeli Ofer Detention Center. Hi, Mom. Did you talk to him? Tell him I’m on my way, I’m running late. Sorry! I just picked it up! Really! One second, stay on the line. With enthusiasm, ambition and a passion for speed, she has overcome social and traditional obstacles to break into the world of speed rallies. When I’m racing with my helmet on, people think I’m a guy. Then they get closer. “It’s a girl!” Because of the current situation, it’s probably hard to practice car racing. Are you able to find space to practice? We don’t have open spaces or a track where we can set up cones and train freely. We do the best we can. I just want to point out the irony that a racing rally can easily happen in any country except Palestine, because every few minutes there’s a military checkpoint. Exactly. What are your future plans? Are you going to take part in international rallies... Someone wrote, “Bravo, Noor.” Someone wrote, “She looks snobby.” Someone wrote, “Bravo Noor, I like your personality!” “You should resist the occupation with stones, not sports and fashion.” “Is this a man or a woman? She’d better go cover herself.” Someone wrote, “This is a sign that the world is coming to an end.” Can you imagine? “A sign of the end.” This one says, “How much of the Koran do you know, Noor?” “You’re just jealous! Stop writing mean, nonsensical comments.” “She deserves support for her talents, not these spiteful, useless comments. We shouldn’t mix things up. Knowing the Koran, liberating Palestine, and this girl’s talent are all important.” As you get older, you start to think about having a role to play, getting married and having kids, taking care of them, doing what your mother did. I met my fiancé on New Year’s. I was at a party in Ramallah with friends. But I didn’t like it so I went to another in Bethlehem and I met him there. We were friends for a year, engaged for six months and we’re getting married in October. What if he tells you he doesn’t want you to race anymore? Just think. If you had to choose between him and racing, I don’t think you’d choose racing. I’ve been under a lot of pressure lately to get married and have a family. I would love to have a home, a husband and a normal life like any other girl. But getting married just for the sake of getting married is an idea I’ve rejected. If I can’t find the right man who will make me happy, I don’t want to get married. Then the tunnel. All racers to your cars, please. Did they memorize the map? They walked it about 15 times, me too. This is the most important race for me. Because the competition between Marah and me is getting fierce. The championship title will go either to me or her. All racers come to the starting line. Come on. We have important information, and if you don’t listen, I don’t care. That’s your problem. Betty Saadeh finished her lap in 1:42! See? It’s very clear. How did she win the championship? “I noticed that, but it doesn’t pose a risk to herself or the crowd.” If Marah’s back door moves even a centimeter, they say she’s out. According to Federation rules, the trunk shouldn’t open for the safety of the racer and the crowd. In the Bethlehem race, Betty’s trunk opened. But neither the judges nor the crowd noticed. She won the championship. Later, there was a photo showing that her trunk opened. For the race in Jenin, Marah replaced her rear door. Hakam told her, “I’m going to shake it. If it moves even one centimeter, you won’t participate. If the door opens, you’re out.” Why should I pay the price for their mistake? Am I supposed to race and monitor the other racers? That’s their job, not mine. They saw the door open. They know it’s wrong, but they let it slide. We have no problem if Betty or Mona or anyone else wins. But not like this. I can’t race in Jericho. I was treated unfairly in the first round. I don’t want to be there. Why are Betty and I the only women in the next race? Mona is busy then, but why isn’t Marah racing? Marah is angry and won’t race. If we’re going to be pouty now... Why make it personal? She said she’s mad, but not why. -She said, “Congratulations.” -You’ll do the same if she wins. Then the next day she’s mad? That doesn’t make sense. You should be the one who’s the most upset. You should be upset about Marah not racing. -You need a girl to compete with. -I don’t compete with the girls. I’m competing with the guys, so I don’t care about the girls. -But we’re one team. -True, but I don’t feel we’re a team. FARAH DENTAL PROSTHETICS OWNER: KHALED IDRIS ZAHALKA Please clear the track because this is a decisive round. On the starting line, Betty Saadeh. Congratulations, Betty Saadeh, the fastest female driver! THE JOY OF BEING THE FASTEST KALAM NAWAEM Has there been disapproval from Palestinians? On the contrary! All Palestinians are proud of us. Betty’s name has become linked to racing in Palestine. Marah has won many times, but she has never been in the spotlight like Betty. The media and commercials are always after me. Because I know how to talk to them, and I’m beautiful and attractive. I’m good publicity for the Federation. “Betty Saadeh.” I’m a brand. -No, not like this. -What? It’s for Facebook! I’ve never seen a “Federation” like this. I can’t call it a racing “Federation.” Only one person makes the rules. The judging committee is just for show. Because I didn’t race in Jericho, he didn’t allow me to race in Aqaba. The race in Aqaba is important to me, because it’s a chance to represent Palestine abroad. This is very important. This opportunity only comes once a year. Let’s be honest, Khaled. Marah is talented. You know that. She’s won several championships. Will you consider letting her compete in Jordan? Absolutely not. Even if there’s a race car waiting for her in Jordan? She didn’t race in Jericho so she’s disqualified. -Is there such a rule? -No, there’s no such rule. -She only missed one race. -She’ll get a chance next year. She only missed one race. Even still. No. Even still. No. Even still. No. The team’s success benefits both myself and the girls. The problem is that men are worried and afraid that women with strong personalities will take their places or affect their decisions. For me, this causes trouble in decision-making and management. I sometimes feel that I’m sidelined as a team manager in order to show that power comes from the Federation and not the team. Look at the smoke! Look at Noor! Go Noor! Hello, dear. -Welcome back! -Thank you. How are you? I’ve missed you. I love your fantastic photos! Thank you, my dear! Really, I love your photos! It looks like you had a wonderful time. I love my job. Did you learn new techniques? That’s wonderful. I can’t wait to see it. I hope so, but this is drifting. I hope we do well. I’m so happy for you. I liked the pictures a lot. It’s great that you’re working to improve yourself. Dear, thank you. I want to see you today at 4:00 PM for a shoot for a German magazine. Every time journalists come, we show them how we train. It’s good for us because it gives them an idea about our team. -Soldiers! -No, there aren’t any. -Yes, over there. -Oh, no! They have tear gas! What’s that, a rock? Get a flat? The soldiers are coming, get up. I told you not to go! It’s no joke. They’re bastards. They’re the army. What’s the matter with you? Are you okay? Let me drive. Where did it hit me? On your back, right in the middle! Is the emergency room on the left? You know? It’s no joke. Training there is getting really dangerous. Next time... We could be liable for anybody who goes there. If a journalist asks to see us train, I won’t go. Okay, but we don’t want to end up disfigured. God forbid one of us gets hit in the face. What a disaster. This is another reason to pressure the Federation and the government to find us a place to train. Psychologically, mentally, I’m not doing well. -Why? Are you still afraid? -Yes! I couldn’t sleep last night. -Why? -You think it’s easy? Is it still bruised? I told you, “Betty, come back. Don’t go.” “Come back, Betty!” We’re always there. I never imagined it could happen! I was shot in the shoulder once, a rubber bullet. There were demonstrations and I was passing through with reporters in the car. They don’t understand. I got shot in my shoulder. All she does is go to the university and come home. Nothing else. Racing opened a new world for Marah. She met new people and it expanded her horizons. Marah’s life without racing would be just an ordinary life. I’m sick and tired of walking the same streets, seeing the same people, the same faces. I love Jenin and the people here, but I need to leave town and see something new. It’s not easy for me to get out and break the routine. I can’t just take my car and go. I must think of the checkpoints and searches I have to pass. Noor and I have Jerusalem IDs which allow us to cross Israeli military checkpoints without a permit. If we want, we can go to Akko, Haifa and the sea in Jaffa. But Marah, Betty, and Mona need permits from the Israeli authorities to cross checkpoints. That’s if they even get them. So for Palestinians with West Bank IDs, the beach is like a dream. Life isn’t always fair. Things aren’t always black and white. If things don’t go the way they’re supposed to, sometimes you just have to keep going. You can’t let things defeat you. Here we are living under occupation, what if we all said, “I’m sick of this. I’m going to live somewhere else”? But despite the difficulties under occupation, we claim our rights by remaining steadfast. When you’ve been treated unjustly, you have to persist. That’s him. Hello? Sweetheart, how are you? I met him through racing. He’s in the Jordanian racing club. And I’m in the Palestinian racing club. Many wanted to marry me, but I wanted to wait for the right person. I never imagined it would come true for me to meet the right man, someone who has all the traits I hoped for. I want to go back. What if Khaled gives you more trouble? Forget about last time. I think... Let’s see. On March 9, you have the race in Jericho. -How do you know? -I just do. You just do? Until this very moment, since Wednesday afternoon, the air strikes against Palestinian targets and locations have not stopped. Hundreds of sorties and hundreds of air strikes... Will this affect the checkpoints now, Dad? -Which ones? -Between here and Ramallah. Of course. They’ll take it out on us now. “Schools have been suspended in Gaza.” There’s a war in Gaza. Who cares about going to school? It will not be easy in Gaza. Israel denies shelling and accuses the Palestinian resistance of shelling. Regardless, the picture is completely different now. I’m terrified because I don’t know what’s going to happen. I’m working now, but possibly, what happened before could happen again. We go home one evening and the next day we’re under curfew. No one can leave. Life under occupation is unstable. You never know what will happen next. I work nearly 18-20 hours a day. I’m racing the clock, because I have responsibilities. Khaled works very hard. We don’t see him anymore. He rarely comes home. In the last 12 days, he only came home for one night. -It’s as if he worked abroad. -Yes, and I work too. I leave the house early in the morning. We’d planned to build a house or buy a car. Khaled decided to buy Marah a new car, so we delayed the house another year. First gear, then second. It does well on the turns. It’s a strong car. Very! That’s why. Focus. Focus. Why? Why, God? Why? Enough already! I want to drive. Forget about winning! Can’t I at least get the track right? Put it in first, second, then hit the gas. Please hit a cone! I’m the winner! BLESSED RAMADAN, MAY EACH YEAR FIND YOU IN GOOD HEALTH I love Ramadan. It has a special atmosphere. Everyone’s way of life becomes similar. We all do almost the same things. And after we break the fast everyone goes out. It’s such a special time. Everyone eats a meal before fasting again at dawn. We stay up to eat together at 3:00 AM, then go to sleep. It’s nice. We all live the same way for a whole month. Hurry a bit, don’t forget the oil. Are you fasting? No. -Yes! -Yes, I am. I always fasted. And I’d be afraid if I skipped a day. I was scared to skip a day. My grandmother always used to tell me that I should fast. But I don’t know, as I got older... It’s not easy for me. I get hungry a lot. And when I fast, I can’t do anything. My day goes nowhere when I’m fasting. And I don’t think we fast the proper way. We do it just because it’s required by Islam. But when we break our fast, everything changes. We forget about religion. When we fast, we’re supposed to feel solidarity with the poor. But the poor can’t afford to eat at all. It’s not just for certain hours, and then later they’ll suddenly have food and money. I’m going to Friday prayers since it’s my last Friday in the country. Next Friday I’ll be in Amman. -How much? -Ten. -Why two balloons? One is enough. -No, two. -Don’t you go to school? -I do. Are you good in school? Here, I’ll be late for prayers. -Give me two dollars. -You charge in dollars? -Buy balloons from me. -I already did. -Please! -Dear, I already did! Please don’t say no. Please don’t disappoint me! -But I don’t have kids. -Come on! For God’s sake. -How much is one? -Three for 20. No, I only want one. -May God bless you. -One only! God grant you 20 million for this 20. I don’t want that. -Where did you come from? -I need some money to take home. All right. Take more! Enough! I already bought from you! Oh, my God! I’m looking forward to my new life with a husband, home and family of my own. But it’s very hard to leave Palestine where I was born and raised. I have wonderful memories of happy times on almost every corner. I really hope my husband and I will return to live in Palestine someday. I need an empty box. What is this, corn? Help me find an empty box. Please, Najeeb. A clean one, eh? We’re done here. I’m ready to start a new life. Here we go. This shop has become my second home, my refuge. A place of my own. I own it, I’m in charge. I make all the decisions. I started it, it’s a big part of my life, I depended on it. But I’m moving on to something even better. Who knows? I might open a bigger store in Amman. You never know. This was a good experience for me. I don’t feel like I’m giving up my freedom. The opposite, I’ll have more freedom, bigger responsibilities, more commitment and I’ll be happy. -You enter this way, in this parking lot. -Why can’t I stay with you? I can’t. It’s not allowed. Okay. I finally got a permit. I’m going with Maysoon and Noor to celebrate winning in Jaffa. There’s the sea! The sea, it’s wonderful. Look at that. I was surprised by Jaffa and Jerusalem. We’re separated by only a checkpoint and a separation wall, yet the difference is huge between here and there. They took the most beautiful places we had. -Imagine if we could come here every day. -God is generous. Marah! Come back! I’m afraid you’ll drown. Come back. If you have a problem, don’t talk to me or Hakam. Talk to Montaser Badarneh. He’s in charge of racer affairs. Give him the objection letter and 100 dinars and he’ll give it to us. -God save us from having to object! -Don’t talk to me or anybody else. Can you go slower? The oil indicator is on. Let’s go there. There’s a problem with the engine. So we advised her to withdraw from the second round. You won’t need a second round. You’ll win based on the first round. Great! Oh, my God! That’s it! Congrats. -My friend. -Congratulations. We won! You should’ve started the turn in first gear, not in second. That was your fault. I feel so much better now. Betty Saadeh, please come to the starting line! You were in the top ten and withdrew, so we took the next fastest girl. -I didn’t know! -She won’t beat your time. -I didn’t know of such a rule! -You forfeited your second round. You forfeited verbally, we disqualify you verbally as well. If I’d known, I would’ve kept racing. Montaser, you should have told her, “If you withdraw, Betty goes to the final.” I can’t. I don’t take sides. I’m neutral. You explained it to Betty. I didn’t explain to her or anyone. I did not explain it. Please clear the track. Betty Saadeh, please come to the starting line! I’m an idiot for racing with this Federation! I’m an idiot for continuing with them. I’m such an idiot! I’m such an idiot! Calm down, Marah. Breathe. Take this. Betty finished her round in 1:30:27. That means the women’s champion is Marah Zahalka! You’re the champion! Marah Zahalka! Come on! Let’s celebrate! Be happy, after three rounds she couldn’t beat you. Even after 20 rounds, she won’t beat you. Congrats, Marah! Marah, Marah! Come what may, Marah will win the day! Come what may, Marah will win the day! God bless you, Noor! Where is the land exactly? It goes from here to that marker with the metal stick. Then to that marker over there. -What happened? -An accident. -What accident? -A car accident!
