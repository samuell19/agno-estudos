You realize this is a very dangerous undertaking. Mexican government will have me hanged for this. But your offer was too good to resist. A Stargate pyramid. Not a soul has been here for five hundred years. Geraldo Rivera, himself, was denied access. It is as beautiful as I remember it. That's funny. I came to see you. I have the one who wants the power. The one who would carry your blood. My mission will soon... end. I'm glad your mother is pleased. If there's nothing else, I'd like my end fee. - Your end fee? - Yes. My final payment. Mother. The man would like his final payment. How much do we owe you? $350,000 dollars. American. A bit harsh, don't you think? Mornin' Charlie! Ten miles. Swine-bird. Please give a warm round for a man who knows who he is, knows what he wants, and knows how to get it! The best regional dealership owner, five years in a row, with 12,000 units sold this year, Mr. Jack Burton! Wow. Well, now this is a surprise again. See, I'd like to start with a joke my daddy used to tell me: So a deer, he was grazing up on a hill... - Charlie. - Hey. - That Jack is a hoot. - Yeah. - He wins it every year. - Yeah. ...and so... We're headed over to Jerry's Smoke House for drinks. - Drinky-drinky. - Come with us. Do you still have the same number from last year? - Yeah. - I'll text you, I'll text you. I got to go. It's good to see you guys. Good to catch up. Bye. ...and that's why I have my fifth award. Schmuck. Charlie, come on. Let's go! Going. Come on, Charlie, let's go. - Damn! - Ha-ha-ha. Ah, speak foreign language, gringo. Dirty. Pretty much just feels good. Charlie, don't... That's wrong, man. - Just go. - I'm running late. - I wore it for you! - Don't say that. That's weird. Why would you do it for me? I don't see the connection. That guy's got at least 150 pounds on you. I know. I got it. - Are you sure? - Yeah! All right! Let's hear it. For the Mayan Mayhem, Aztec Avenger, Marco, Whoo-hoo! You okay? Hey, what... What's up with that? What's up with that? Good luck. Oh, shit. Take down! Take down! Sorry. My bad. Keep doing what you're doing. Chus, man! Chus, man! Unbelievable! That was huge! I'm gonna train you. And that training may save your life - one of these days. - That's a great idea. Dude, I'm not a fighter. You are. What's up with the bird food, man? Salads. What's up with that? I've been having this problem. The doctors told me if I try this: eat clean, maybe it'll go away. I've tried psychiatrists, I keep having this nightmare over and over and over. The same dream that you always had, Yeah. It's the same one. Hey, have you talked to Karina? Nope. Uh-uh. How's your sister doing? I don't know, man, I just... I just worry about her, you know? If something ever happens to me... look out for her. Okay? Of course, dude. You don't have to... yeah. Hey, sweet dreams, man. Ha. Very funny. I'm gonna get some rest. Mr. Clark, banker Bernie again on line one. Mr. Clark, banker Bernie again on line one. Hey, Bernie! How was Sainte-Tropez? Listen, Charlie, this isn't buddy Bernie calling. This is banker Bernie. And banker Bernie says you're in deep financial shit, man. Now, the board's voted to take the dealership from you. They're gonna appoint a trustee to run it. Look, I'm about to head over that way... and check on your projections and... My God... Our debt is choking us. If we don't come up with solutions, we're going down. - That's it. - But Charlie, how can we sell when there's no clientele even coming in the door? We have no budget whatsoever for our advertising campaign. Look, Charlie, I know, okay, I'm confident, you believe in this team. What you need to do is give us a shot. We talk about family here. We talk about being united. Look, Charlie, you can have it all or you can lose it all. Hey, Karina. I see you haven't changed much. Still the same tantrums. How are you? Nana wants to see you. It's important. But is everything okay? Not really. Hey, hey! Whoa! Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa. Stop it! Run, Charlie! What do you mean, run? Stay away. I will hurt you. Where's the stone? What's going on? Who are they? And how can you fight like that? All I can tell you is that our lives are in danger. The rest... you'll have to hear from Nana. Nana? Nana! Nana! Nana! Nana? Charlie, your father has asked that you stay here while he and your stepmother figure out some things. But you can stay here as long as you like, Dude, this is gonna be great, bro. - Who's this? - This is Charlie. Say hello to him. He's gonna stay with us awhile. Why do we let every gringo on the block move in? Ay, Karina. Every family's not perfect, Charlie. Sometimes we just have to make our own. I didn't know they were following me. But I still kept my promise to keep Charlie out of it. Out of what? Marco, you've been hiding something from me ever since we were kids. Dude, I'm just tryin' to keep you safe, bro, okay? It's affecting my life. - Stop it. - It's affecting my business! Stop the arguing. Please. All three of you are very special to me. I've tried to keep you safe. To prepare you each in your own way. Nana, regardless of what we want, we can't do this without him. Which is what I've been saying from the beginning. Nana. Enough with the riddles. Talk to me. Very well, Charlie. Prepare yourself because this will sound impossible. Millennia ago, the gods came to Earth and gifted humanity with the green stone of immense power. With it we were able to build incredible Stargates to harness the energy of the universe. But that power to create was also a power that could destroy. So the gods chose my brother, my sister, and myself and imbued us with the stone's essence to protect humankind. We were the first trio of light. Combining into a force greater than ourselves. But such power corrupts, as it always does. And my sister became obsessed with not merely serving the gods, but becoming one of them. When she was denied, she sought her revenge. She attempted to steal the stone, the source of our power, and use it to create a force of chaos. My brother and I had no choice but to confront her, but we were too late. The power of the stone had consumed her. And she was pregnant with a child prophesized to bring about the Apocalypse. My brother and I could not bear to kill our sister. So we sealed her, still pregnant, in the catacombs of the long lost Temple. She was entombed there for a thousand years. And she was freed by an explorer who had no idea the evil he was unleashing. Not just my sister, but the child she bore, Drake. The Maya Apocalypse made flesh. Now the only way to stop them is to form a new trio of light to protect us all. Charlie, I've kept you from our destiny. Your own destiny. Because the three of us thought you would not be able to handle the responsibility. I think it's time. Yes. What do you want? Well, well. So this is the Protector of humanity. Let's see what's in store for humanity. Okay. Let's make this fair. Watch. Let's go! Where are we going? To our secret sanctuary. The force field will keep us safe for a while. The birds are going haywire outside there. Singing songs of love. But there's no sweeter sound than the voice of the woman you love. Zip it. Charlie! You're not going to go outside - wearing those things, are ya? - No. No, no, they're not mine. You might step in some cow dung. Top of the morning to you, mademoiselle Karina. I'm losing my patience, you need to tell me where I fit in to all this. You remember that dream that you used to have when you were a little boy? Yeah, I still have it. Well, it wasn't a dream. What? I've often wondered why you woke up on that night of all nights. Was it an accident or the Hand of Fate? Either way... the woman you saw was no dream. She was my sister, Lechusa... and she was there for the emerald. Nana? I sent her away for a while. But she hit you. I healed you with the energy of the emerald and to my surprise, I linked you to the power of the stone. You are the green warrior we were waiting for. You are going to complete the new Trio of Light to defeat Drake. But we have a very big problem with Lechusa. Now that she finally found a Stargate pyramid and I'm the one linked to the emerald, if she takes me and the stone to that place, she would be able to transfer all of the power to Drake and transform him into a higher being, who will destroy all humankind. Who's the gringo? It doesn't matter. They don't have enough time to train him. He's of no consequence. We stick to the plan. We find my sister and the emerald. We need you, Charlie. We can't do this without you. It's time to start your training. Hey, let's try and not level a city this time. You're never gonna let me live that down, huh? Since we're all here, like, for nothing, let's have a drink. These are the Council of Masters. They have helped us to develop the powers we inherited. Master Hung, Kung Fu expert. I met him at the Forbidden City when I was doing my research. Yah! Hah! Hah! Yah! Master Kane, Master of Modern Martial Arts. Trained by Aztec and Maya shamans. Master Gin, my brother studied Drunken Boxing, but only learned the drunken part. These Masters are here to teach you the basis of Martial Arts. Each Master is here to help you reach your full potential. You will be the third... fighting alongside Karina and Marco. As a team you will become El Trio de la Luz. In the process, Master Gin will be your mentor. The two of you will be connected at the hip. You listen to what he has to say. What he teaches you will save your life. Whoopee. I hope this was good enough. Now, put the dirt in the wheelbarrow. Now... take the wheelbarrow to the lake. A flat tire, really? All right, now, cross the lake! That's impossible. I'll drown. Impossible is a big word used by very small men. Confuse-You-Say! Don't make things harder than they are! I told you to cross the lake. I didn't say anything about the wheelbarrow. Why do I, uh, have to sleep in here again? Hey. Joined at the hip, remember? At least you could clean up your crap. This is a collection of the finest... Finest... - Crap. - Shut up, go to sleep. Okay. Idiot! You're up early. How does this triad of warriors things work? How are we going to beat Drake? Well, in theory the three of us must take control of his energy, redirect it and shoot it back at him, combining our three elements. We are vessels of energy, but not all access is created equally. So what does that mean? Well, put it this way: most people who can use the power can only store so much within them, like a small battery like this. Others can store as much as a tractor battery. And then there are the very, very, very few who can store as much energy as... I don't know, the Sun. So how big do you think my "battery" is? What? Hope it's big enough, Charlie. Hey, Charlie! Master Hung's ready for you, come on! It's that Kung Fu shit. This guy was your corner man? Why? Charlie! Yah! Charlie. Yah! Oh, boy. How 'bout that? Aye! Hm. Hey, take it easy. He's getting better. He's getting faster and stronger. Get the stone. We know where it is. It's out of the city at the countryside. Lakes, water. So, how do you feel about all this weight of the world stuff on your shoulders? Well, Nana seems to believe in me but the... The Masters, they're a whole other story. No, they believe in you, Charlie, they're just testing your limits. You need to stop over thinking. Just let go. Yah! It's weight off your hips. Snaps out the end of your fists. Don't telegraph your stuff. Left, left, left. Good left. Charlie, Charlie. Hah, hah! Green Ghost! Business slow? Looks like you started to buy the cheap stuff. Everything okay? The oracle told me where the sanctuary is. At last. We will send Moon Eyes. She's the only one that can deactivate the force field with her special ability. Gin? Gin, wake up. Yah! She needs to rest now. It's all we can do for her. The connection to the stone is strong. Its loss is affecting her. She'll adjust to it soon. But far from the stone she won't be able to use her powers so they will come for her. Of course, the stone doesn't mean anything without my sister. But we're halfway there. Why did he lose, Gin, huh? How could Nana be so wrong? Mira. Physically, he's ready. But up here... he's not ready. Well, the only time he's focused is when he's wearing that stupid costume. What stupid costume? You still don't understand. This is about teamwork. Why didn't you wake us up? Teamwork. Believe in yourself. The Green Warrior. Yeah. Can't trust a man that won't wake everyone up when the end of the world's at stake. That kid of yours is a spoiled, lazy, useless slob and I want him out of here. You've got to be kidding. That's my son! Charlie! Charlie, Charlie! Nana! Nana! For a guy who looks like he's got it all together on the surface, you're a... a shallow well of wasted potential. Screw you. Oh, yeah, no, no, wait, I get it now. Marco told me how you ended up on the doorstep. Yes, Charlie, you were abandoned when you were young. And yes, your father was an asshole, but if the three of you don't get things in sync then this whole thing was a waste of time. And the whole world will suffer your failure. We need to move Nana to a safer location. It's only a matter of time before they come back for her. - The force field is down. - And go where? Anywhere. - Charlie? - Hey. He's not capable of making his own decisions. I'm not going anywhere. Charlie, I'm sorry I brought you into this. It's not your fault, mijo. It's mine. I'm sorry. I'm truly sorry. I let you all down. Oh, you planning a pity party for one? More sarcasm. That's a real useful power, Gin. Power? You have no idea what you're playing with. The power you have inside you can tear apart the entire fabric of this world. You say I have this power inside me, just show me how to find it! The power is like alcohol. Drink it sad, you cry. Drink it mad, you fight. Drink it happy, you make love. You're all crazy. Crazy? I'll show you crazy. Nana? Nana. Na-na. Come out and play. Hey, Dumbass. Master Hung. I thought you will run away like you always do. Turn around when you talk to me. I've been waiting a long time to face you again in combat. Really? Look at you. You are still stupid ass-face. Yah! Yah! Oh! Master Kane. Nice outfit. I hear great stories about you. Let's see if they're true. I'm going to kick your ass. Nice. Yah! Why do you always have to be so stubborn? C'mon, mother. Don't you know that mother knows what's going on in that little heart of yours. And by the way, you were getting your ass kicked. Now grab my sister. Charlie, there's someone here to see you. - Thank you, Sergio. - Can we talk? Masters Kane and Hung have been teleported away. Drake took Nana. What? Drake. You okay? Yeah. I'm Okay. Listen, I'm going to head on home. You need anything before I leave? No. It's okay. I'll take a little time... to take care of some family matters. I'm going to turn it around for you, Charlie. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Every family is not perfect, Charlie. Sometimes, we just have to make our own. What are you doing here, man? You're my brother. Karina, Nana, you're all I've ever had. I would die for you. All of you. What's Mexican... without Green Ghost? Oh, hey, excuse me, I didn't mean to interrupt you two. Since you guys have kissed and made up, we got to get you out those gringo clothes. It's going to be a little bit difficult to take you seriously in that get up. All right, well... does that help? Okay, yeah. Machete? I don't need no stinking machete. I got this. Go! Hurry! Charlie! What are you doing, Charlie? Charlie! We don't have time for this. I told Gin this was a bad idea. - Arm, arms! - Come on. Argh! Ugh, Marco! Wait! Zip, zip! I've got this. Go. - You sure? - Go! Aah! Watch out for my drink! Bet you didn't see that coming. Ladies, this isn't coffee break. Let's go! Charlie. I'm glad you made it. Interesting costume, is that pistachio? It's just green, you moron. Come over here, gringo, so I can kill you and get on with it. Get down there. Come on, come on. Oh! You still got it, Nana! Come here, Charlie. No! - Oh. - Get up. Get up. I'm finished. I'm done by. Charlie. I'm just an old man. I've fought many a hard bottles. Battles. I never doubted you, Charlie. I was just pissed off at you, because you doubted yourself. Now the three of you must ignite to connect your power. If one of you does not ignite, we will all die, at Drake's hands. Charlie. - Charlie! - Grab his legs. - Got him. - What now? - Charlie? - Come on, Charlie! You'll never reach the power. That kid of yours is a useless slob, and I want him out of here. You're weak, you're nothing. Nana! Nana! Loser. This is teamwork, the power of three. Come on! Come on, Charlie! You failed, Gringo. It's Green Ghost. Now! You did it. It's time to bring in the New Age. Let me, please. Come on, go, go, go! Go, now! All right, take this. - Sorry, boss! - Sorry, boss. Wow, Sergio. These numbers are amazing. How'd you do that? What's really made the difference? Teamwork. We created a family. Charlie, Charlie, Charlie!
