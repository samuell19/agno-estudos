Aso erupted. Under the falling volcanic ash, at 4pm, September 17th 1641, Lord Tadatoshi Hosokawa Ecchuno-kami, 54 man-neku daimyo, died in the Hiunkaku room of Kumamoto castle. You have married into this house very recently so maybe you don't know, my son was always treated favourably by the late lord. He closely served the lord. My son likes sake very much. He has made unpardonable mistakes due to his drinking. But the lord said "No, it was not Chojuro's mistake, but the sake has done it.â€œ The lord generously always pardoned him. To respond to his lord's generosity. he must follow the lord to the grave. And everyone believes he has to commit junshi (follow to the grave). So I expect and I am prepared that my son will bravely perform seppuku. Today, when he came to give me his farewell greeting I was so pleased. I know it's a real shame for you. No, mother, I also have long prepared to part from him today. Is that so? That is really good. You are brave. You really are the wife of Chojuro. Dear. Dear. You slept well. Mother was worried it was getting late, so I woke you up, sir. I see. I drank so comfortably, excuse me for my nap. What time is it now? Around noon, sir. Noon already. I'm refreshed. Chojuro, you are awake. Yes, I have been woken now. After tea and rice, I have to go to Toko-in temple. Prepare. Yes, sir. I've already given the order. Big brother, Seki-sama has arrived, sir. I see. Naito Chojuro Mototsugu, 150-koku, 17 years old Junshi at Tokoin temple Kaishaku by Seki Koheiji I am going to cut my belly to die now. After I die, you will be a stray dog. I pity you for that. Listen, don't you want to die with me? If you want to stay alive as a stray dog, eat these rice balls. If you want to die, don't eat. Understood? Which is it? I see. Then can you die with me? You don't forget favours and want to do junshi? Good. I'm sorry. Then, die for the faith. Matsuno-sama, please. September 26, Tsuzaki Gosuke Nagasue, stipend for two, 38 years old Junshi at Korinji temple Kaishaku by Matsuno Nuinosuke Junshi, junshi. Master. Junshi continues one after another. it means they were really faithful, doesn't it? Sure they were. They showed their loyalty through seppuku by following the lord to the grave. Then if someone does not commit seppuku, isn't he unfaithful? Don't be stupid. You cannot commit junshi if the lord doesn't allow. If you die without permission it is called a dog's death. Stupid. But in a dog's death, even the dying is faithful, isn't it? You can't understand it but, honour is most important to a samurai. Samurai cannot tolerate a dog's death. Now, I will go. Don't be upset. Do so gracefully. Yes, sir. I will cut gracefully. Abe-sama. Ihara-uji. It's a perfect day today, sir. Yes, it is. Thank you for Kobayashi- sama's assistance, sir. Please be reassured. Excuse me, sir. Now, you are, sir. Ihara-sama, Oh, thank you. How great he is. Oota Kojuro-dono was the 12th junshi. I heard Miyanaga Katsuzaemon-dono in charge of the kitchen committed seppuku. Abe-uji. Takeuchi-uji. Birds of a feather flock together. Fellow sufferers pity each other. Abe-uji is the head of poison tasters. Takeuchi-uji is the head of okosho (page). They were given special favours by the late lord. Without responding to the generosity of the lord, they are still alive. Even a dog committed junshi. Not only a dog. They say that during the service at Shu-un-in temple, two hawks called Ariake and Akash which were pets of the late lord, circling around the sky, then dashed into the pond. Even hawks followed the lord to the grave, that was said in Edo. It must be the junshi of the hawks. Even animals know faith like that. Much more than humans. According to records, two on the case of Lord Kato Kiyomasa. More recently, three years ago, four, for Lord Shimazu, and 10 junshi, for the lord Date in Sendai-han. So the 18 men in our case is enormous. - Don't you think so, Hayashi-uji? - True. It was derived from the virtue of our late lord. They were all given large favours by him. Isn't that so, Hayashi-uji? Yes, in our han, anyone with faith asked the late lord for junshi permission. If he misses the occasion for junshi, he'll be continually ashamed afterwards. Hayashi-uji should know that. In 1632, when the Shogun Hidetada passed away. Morikawa Dewa-no-kami followed the shogun to the grave by junshi, meanwhile, Nagai Shinanno-nokami Nobumasa shamelessly survived. Living long is better than being blamed. It was said that embarrassed Shinanokami, who was forestalled by Dewa. Wasn't that so, Hayashi-uji? Yes, it was. In 1610, Honda Torakazu's son, Ootani Sanpei's footwear servant, name unknown, left his death poem that, I don't want to die, I don't want to die, Now I regret the master's favour to me. If a samurai didn't die when he should have, that's it? Sure, sure. The poison taster is clinging to his life. Hata-uji, Clinging to life? Who are you talking about? Abe-dono pleaded junshi from the late lord, but he couldn't get permission. Everyone knows that. Abe Yaeichi-uemen-dono repeatedly asked junshi when he was in night charge. He said "It's my first and last request in life." However, the late lord never allowed him. You knew that. Hata-uji, where are you going? Now, we perform the process of changing offices. The chief of retainers of Edo-duty 1000-goku, Hayashi Geki Naotsugu is discharged from office and appointed as Inspector General, 3000-goku. Oometsuke 2500-koku, Makino Unemenosho Hisayoshi is discharged from office and appointed to head of archive of Edo-duty, 1700-koku. The head of archive of Edo-duty 1200-koku, Ono Saemonosuke Hiroyuki is discharged from office and appointed the head of okosho (page). 2000-goku. Finance Minister 1300-koku, Katsura Ichibei Mitsumasa... Wait. It must be mistake for Hyobe Michimasa. Katsura Hyobei Michimasa, is discharged from office and appointed head wardrobe keeper of Edo-duty, 1200-koku. The head of okosho (page) 2000-goku, Takeuchi Kazuma Nayamasa is discharged from office and appointed the head of close attendants, 1150-koku. The head of poison tasters, 1700-koku, Abe Yaichiamon Michimasa, is discharged the office and appointed head of close attendants, 1100-koku. Tsukamoto-uji, excuse me here. Master returning. Returning, sir. Welcome back, sir. Saki. Yagobei is busy. Tasuke, come. Come on, you can't be a samurai. Come on. Tasuke-san, do it! Saki! You are embarrassing. Now, push there. Matashichiro. There you are. Your spear cannot beat this Yagobei. Fine talk. Your skill is good but you cannot beat me. I won't be beaten by you. Good. Then we'll try. Dear! Brother. I can't stand it. What's the matter, Shichinojo? My fellow pupils jeered at me that Abe's father took advantage of no-permission so that he could survive. If he can't cut his belly, it's the same as a gourd, he can oil the gourd and cut it. I can't stand, no, I can't. Shichinojo, is it true? They said "apply oil on a gourd." Who said that? I'll stab him with a spear. Yagobei, wait. Are you suggesting this is the rumour all around the han? Yes. I see. Father, all the brothers have arrived. - Ichidayu and Godayu too? - Yes, sir. Keep them waiting a little. Now, I will give you my sword, I will give you my sword. You want to become a samurai. That's why I give you this. Thank you very much, sir. This is the soul of a samurai. My soul. - Take good care of it. - I will, sir. It is my soul. Alright? Thank you very much, sir. Thank you for your coming at night. I called you. I assume you have been exposed to the rumours about me. You must feel ashamed. To tell you the truth, days ago I was told by a colleague that, Yaichiuemon-dono will keep serving the will of the late lord. Father was the head of poison tasters, son is a retainer close to the young lord. Father, son, brothers, all are serving as before. How honoured, he said so. His remarks insinuated something. I was so frustrated. I see. I see. But I don't cling to my life. I have never clung to my life. Rather, I cling to the name of honour. But, for the honour of my name, I don't care for a dog's death. This is the ultimate for a samurai. Yes, that is the ultimate for a samurai. You must have heard the rumour which is spreading in the han. They say the belly of this Yaichiuemon is the belly of an oiled gourd to cut. So, now I will oil the gourd and cut the belly. Anyway, Gonbei, take a drink. Serve me too. When I, who supposedly is not to die, dies. You are sons of the man who did not get permission, Therefore some will despise you. But don't react to those men whose only concerns are themselves. Understand? If they continue to despise you, it is your fate being born as my son. You can't help it. If you are disgraced, take the shame together. Never fight between brothers. Understand? Never fight between brothers. Understand? There is no one in history who oiled a gourd and committed oibara. Remember your unique-spirited father whenever you look at a gourd. You know, you must be united with each other, behave as samurai should. Alright? For memory's sake, watch my best performance. People may think I am insane Toe. Father-dono next door seems in a good mood. He's not influenced by the rumour in the han. Perfectly headstrong. Due to today's excitement, I'm worried what will happen. You are not the only one who is worried. - Tasuke-san. - What? You told me your master said he gave you the soul of a samurai. Good for you. Brother... concerning things from now on. You, Ichidayu and Godayu you were given 200-koku each for military exploits in Shimabara battle. I had bad luck during the war and got no stipend. Till now I've been fed by father. From now on I'll be taken care of by you. But whatever happens, you can rely on a good spear in your hand. No need to mention it. We won't know what will be, but my stipend is the same as yours. True. We don't know what will be. "Oibara is not regarded as permitted junshi", so, someone will start to say. As father told us we might be despised. It's obvious. Don't forget father's words. Take the shame together. No matter what, we will face it. Whatever happens, we brothers will never separate, will be united, brother. Um, I have brothers so they won't speak ill of father so easily. I will tell mother and have the women say farewell to father. 1641 October 17th, the new lord Hosokowa Higo-no-kami Mitsuhisa performed the procedure of inheritance. My Lord, I humbly ask you to consider the inheritance of the families of the men who committed junshi. Did you give them special favour? All of them are given increased stipend, sir. However, regarding the treatment of Abe Yaichiemon's family, it was oibara without permission, so was treated a little differently. Was Ichidayu given an increase? Yes, sir. Do as you see fit. Tasuke-san. Tasuke-san. Wait. Tasuke-san, where are you going? Wherever. Are you going back to your village? Never. I will become a samurai. Listen, Tasuke-san. Don't you want to go back to your home village, with me? Tasuke-san... Shut up! I want be a samurai before I die. Tasuke, you fool! Tasuke, you fool! Osaki-san, goodbye. Let me know if you find a new master. Please... Tasuke-san. Shichinojo, we were both given new stipends. Let's go report to father. That's good, sir. Master... I wanted to commit oibara immediately after you cut belly but, I have no permission. I thought it loyal if I keep serving. If I cannot do it either, now I will follow you. I will follow you, master. Please consider that I am a faithful servant, the same as a samurai. I can save my face by holding the soul of a samurai. Grave of Abe Yaichiuemon Tasuke, you are Tasuke. Fool. What are you doing? Young master, please let me die. Don't die a dog's death, stupid. Maybe something happened to you, Tasuke. I was released. Fired? Did you do something wrong? No, sir. With the inheritance, the main master's stipend was divided between brothers equally. It means the stipend of the master's successor decreased to a minimum. What? Big brother was demoted? Therefore he dismissed me. I see. So that's that. Ani-ue, if the office treat us like this, I've lost face. This just enhances their contempt for us. We can't help it. Any shame we take together. Even if the family is demoted and we all become much of a muchness, we are united together, we have nothing to be ashamed of. Yes, of course. Tasuke, I'll hire you. Is it true, sir? Yes, I appoint you as young servant of the house of Abe Yagobei, 200-koku. Thank you very much, sir. Be quiet. Move away. Kneel down, Kneel down. 1642, for the service of the first anniversary of Lord Tadatoshi's death, the priest Tenyu of Daitokuji temple, Kyoto, visited Kumamoto. 1642, September 17th [Ancestral tablets] [Mortuary tablet of the late lord] Profane! I am not insane. Insane! Abe-uji. Calm down and listen to what I say. Your behaviour which was done without considering the circumstances, came from your insanity, didn't it? You believe I am insane, but I am not. The lord regards that I cannot serve as well as my father, therefore my stipend was divided and given to my brothers. I cannot face the late lord and the current lord, much less... my father, my family, and colleagues. Thinking that, today I prayed to the mortuary tablet. I was overwhelmed. I decided to give up being a samurai. You are so overwhelmed that - you lost your sanity, didn't you? - No, sir. It was not insanity. He admitted his misconduct and said he would accept any punishment, but insisted he was not insane. So he said he would give up being a samurai. Yes, sir. "The book of Five Rings is the last service for the lord." so said Ninmen Musashi, who gave up being samurai and became a monk. And Gonbei who cut his hair tie to become a monk at my father's memorial service. Both of them have caused me to lose face. My father left the men for me. Those men left me one after another. Because they think I am too young. Geki. I understand, sir. I leave the issue of Gonbei to you. Do whatever you think fit. Judayu (Hata). Gonbei shall be kept at Ichino-kami's house temporally. Certainly, sir. Ichinokami. Regarding the issue of Gonbei, it's determined you keep him temporally. The execution takes place after priest Tenyu leaves Kumamoto. Understood? Certainly, sir. Go Rin no Sho (The Book of Five Rings) The Book of Earth Most samurai believe the way of the samurai is simply to die. ~The way to death is no different from priests, women, farmers, and lower classes who know giri. In a person who intends to kill themself there is no difference at all. Brother Gonbei always thought alone and acted alone. It has come to this. Ani-ue. what will happen to brother Gonbei? What will the Abe family be? For big brother it's a matter of seppuku. Whatever his motivation, the act was culpable, no doubt. He cannot avoid seppuku. Can't we implore for his life? By asking someone? We don't know the result, but what shall we do? Brother Ichidayu is... close to the lord. You can do it. That's right. Will you beg the lord for mercy? No, I have been suspended. How could I ask the lord directly? But in this situation we have to do something. You have no duties at the castle. How could you know my situation? You think only of your future and don't care about brother Gonbei. What? Say that again! I'll say it over and over. You think only of your future. Come! Do it. Wait! Fool! Such a sight! Father told us not to fight between brothers. By the way, I have an idea. For the memorial service, the priest Tenyu of Daitokuji temple at Murasakino has visited from far Kyoto. We have no other person whom we can ask for help. The priest Tenyu can do it. Yes, the priest Tenyu can. What? The bonze? Wait for my good news. Wait. The messenger is you, Ichidayu. You know. You are. As I listened to the story of your family, I was really sorry for you. We beg for your help to reduce the punishment of our brother. I know. However, I am not in a position to interfere in the politics of the han. Is it not possible, sir? Well, no, don't worry too much. Besides, your big brother cut his hair tie. That means he performed gedatsu (free from desires) and is now a priest. I don't believe he will lose his life. Is that so? The world is neither arising nor ceasing, never to be controlled by ordinary people. But I will try to appeal for mercy to spare his life, if I have an occasion. Be relaxed. We appreciate your kindness. Thank you very much, sir. Kneel down, kneel down. October 19th, the priest Tenyu left Kumamoto Saki, bring some ame candies. Yagobei-sama, you look like a child. Toe-dono, you are caring for the flowers. I will give you this. Thank you very much, ma'am. Chosen-ame candy! Thank you very much, ma'am. Tsukamoto-sama is visiting, sir. Welcome back, sir. Yagobei, don't be shocked. Gonbei-dono will be executed by hanging. What? Hanging? When? - Tomorrow morning, at 11. - Thank you for informing us. It can't be. I pleaded with the priest Tenyu. The priest Tenyu has left already. Yagobei, I have been thinking. Why don't you ask Musashi sensei? Musashi sensei? Yes. Like my brother Musashi sensei is in the priesthood now. Sensei was the sword instructor for the late lord. Good idea! Ani-ue, I will visit him now. Bring me my horse! They say Musashi sensei is on Kinpozan mountain. There is a temple called Unganji at the foot of the mountain. He stays alone in a rock room there. Can he save his life? I don't know. Listen, Tasuke-san. If you want to be successful, you can do nothing in this family. Give up now. Don't say that. I hope he will make it in time. Over and over. It's no use. Once the sentence is determined it cannot be changed. Gonbei profaned the mortuary tablet of the late lord. Such an irreverent act deserves capital punishment. However, he is a member of the family of junshi. Please consider seppuku as a samurai. No. You said junshi, but it was done without permission. His oibara was treated as junshi, with special mercy of the lord, Legally speaking, it should be separated from true junshi for political justice. But Gonbei-dono's motive came from the distinction. Takeuchi-dono, you were favoured by the late lord as well as the deceased Abe, therefore you especially sympathize with the family. I understand your feelings. However, politics are order. If someone disturbs that order, he must be punished severely. That is my policy. Rules are rules, indeed, sir. But please make an allowance for mercy. No. There's no need to repeat it. Hayashi-sama, the lord will leave for falconry, sir. Excuse me. A cunning man. He never understands true human compassion. Tsukamoto-uji, we can't expect anything. You must give up. Shichinojo, how about sensei? I found him, I pleaded repeatedly but, he said nothing, just kept carving a statue of Fudo Myo-o (Acala). He uttered one word, then continued to quietly carve again. What did he say? "To die a big death is to have lived a big life." Only that? "To die a big death is to have lived a big life." Will Gonbei ani-ue be saved? Stupid. Such a sutra like remark cannot save a life. No. Big brother abandoned samurai at the risk of his life. Revive brother's soul, that is a riddle questioned by sensei. October 10th, 11am. Gonbei was executed at Ide-no-kuchi. The Abe have gathered at the house at Yamazaki, and seem to be discussing something. Has the execution of Gonbei been done? Yes, sir. Done perfectly. Investigate what they are plotting. Lord, it was reported the Abe clan gathered at the house in Yamazaki. It seems that they are hatching a plot. Do as you see fit. Judayu, what are you doing? Go now. Yagobei-sama. Noisy. What's the matter? An officer has sneaked into the house. Give the order to the young men to patrol the house. What can we achieve by fighting against 54-man-goku? It's nothing but extinction for our clan. Don't resist the authorities. If we prove we have no intention to rebel, our stipends will be decreased but we can be saved. No seppuku allowed as a samurai and exposed to hanging in daytime. We are his family. How can I go back to my colleagues and work again? We have no hope for family success any more. He is right. I killed! Tasuke's first achievement. I killed the officer. Fool. Tasuke, well done. We'll come. Now, we've crossed the line. Our father told us to be united and behave as samurai should. This is the time. If this were olden times we could all leave Kumamoto. But these are peaceful times and no lord will hire us. No land to stay, no place to leave. This is the current fate of the Abe clan. Let's fight and die as samurai together. To die a big death is to have lived a big life. The Abe clan is besieged in the house at Yamazaki and plotting rebellion. Therefore, tomorrow the 21st, at 6am it is determined to send pursuers. To the front gate, Takeuchi Kazuma Tadamasa, team leader Soejima Kuhei and, Nomura Shobei Kiyoteru follow Takeuchi. To the back gate, Takami Gonemon Shigemasa, superintendent Hata Judayu Shigeaki. Hata-uji. We are honoured to be given the duty of pursuers. You can achieve something. Yes, good. Fifty years ago, castle attacks and field battles were a daily job. Compared to that, the Abe clan is easiest of all. Isn't it so, Hata-uji? Yes, Takami-uji. I'm excited. So you are trembling with excitement. Takeuchi-uji. According to my information the reason for your appointment as head of pursuers is you were favoured by the late lord, nevertheless. What are you saying? You didn't commit junshi and are still alive. Are you saying I didn't commit junshi, that's why I was appointed as the head of pursuers? Alright, I will die fighting. The Godayu-sama family has arrived. Osaki-san. [At the house of Tsukamoto Matashichiro] Listen all. The next house, the Abe's, will be attacked by the authorities, in the morning, at six. Close your doors carefully and take care of any fire. Other than the official pursuers we are not allowed to attack the Abe. However, we can kill any fugitives freely. Those were the two orders of the authorities. Understood? Hasn't Ichidayu come yet? Not yet, sir. Maybe he ran away. Don't be silly. There's no such coward in the Abe clan. The Ichidayu-sama family has arrived. Ani-ue. We had to take a detour, so we are unexpectedly late. Nice you could all come. Rest over there. Thank you very much, sir. They say this Yaichiuemon's belly is a belly to cut an oiled gourd. Gonbei, well no, Ichidayu, take a drink. Ichidayu, serve me a cup too. If I, who supposedly don't die, died you are the son of oibara-cutting man without permission, so someone will despise you. You see? Take no notice of short-sighted men. Can't help it. If you are shamed, take it together. Do not fight between brothers. A man who applies oil to a gourd and cuts oibara is... You see? When you see a gourd, remember your unique-spirited father. Behave as a samurai should. You see? As a samurai, alright? For memory's sake, watch my best performance. [Noh song "Kiyotsune"] How was the tea? I can't taste it. Give me another. Toe... Will you visit next door? Unlike me, you are woman. If your visit was revealed later, we can make an excuse somehow. Take something pleasant for the children. Yes, sir. Women and children must be killed first so we can avoid being seen as unseemly figures. A pity, yet there's no other choice. Don't be downhearted. A man supposedly will die once. Now, I will go say farewell to mother. Tasuke, prepare as I told you before. Mother, big sister, this is the end of the Abe clan. I believe you are ready. There's no need to mention it. We would never stay behind. We will join you soon. Tasuke, why are you digging a hole? The women and the elderly will be buried. Tasuke, do you want to be a samurai so much? Shut up! Ma'am, it is ready. Sir, I will go now. If I am found, I will never involve you, sir. Give my greetings. Sirs, madam from next door. - What? Toe-dono from next door? - Visiting, sir. Oba-chama, oba-chama. Oba-chama gives you something good. Saki. Oba-sama, thank you very much. Let's go. Wow, chosen-ame candy! Sirs... I don't know what to say. Toe-dono, please guess our feelings. Toe-sama, thank you very much. We believe this is destined. I perceive it. Toe-dono, what brought you here? Please go home. Please go home! Ani-ue. Matashichiro-dono is a fine samurai who has his master. We are rejected by the master. You cannot visit us for consolation. Compassion is compassion. It is a weakness. However, Toe-dono... We will die like this. Nobody will pray to the Buddha for our repose. If you remember us sometimes, please prey for our souls in a Buddhist service. Mountain storm! Ma'am, it is said when the mountain becomes violent, evil things will happen. True. Tomorrow the Abe clan will become extinct. Tasuke-san. Tasuke-san, come. Listen, Tasuke-san. Tomorrow morning, at six, I will wait for you at Shirakawabata. You must escape and come, please. You come, at six. Please, Tasuke-san. I won't run away. I want to show I died as a samurai. Saki... Tasuke-san. I will wait for you. Tasuke-san, you see? At six, Shirakawabata river bank. Saki. I am back now, sir. How was it? All of them were so pleased. I see. Tomorrow, the authority pursuers will be as at war to conquer the rebels. On such an occasion a samurai cannot sit and watch. Compassion is compassion. Duty is duty. As you know, compassion is compassion, duty is duty. October 21st 1642 At six a.m. Matashichiro-dono, you've always boasted. Now show me your skill with a spear. I'm waiting. Wait, sir. Tono is the commander today. I will be the herald. Move away. Oh, they've attacked now. Yes, sir. The storm is over. It's a fresh morning. Maybe about here... it's over! Coward. Don't withdraw. No, I don't withdraw. I will cut my belly. Oji-sama, challenge! To die a big death... Ani-ue. Ani-ue. Reporting, sir. We conquered all the Abe clan, sir. First Takeuchi Kazuma-dono in charge of the front gate was killed. Kazuma killed? Before starting the battle Kazuma-dono said he would go to die, so he must have intended to die. I believe Kazuma-do intended to die. Kazuma left me too. Musashi too. I begged Musashi respectfully to leave the priesthood but he ignored me. All of them left me. Everyone left me. And Tsukamoto Matashichiro, living the next door, he broke the order in order to pre-empt the others. He killed Yagobei and was injured. That's outrageous. Disturbing the order goes against politics. Shut up, Geki, The risk and faith of Matashichiro are great. He is a true samurai. Take special care of his injury. Do you understand, Geki? By the way, Judayu, what was your achievement? You fool. Where is the soul of a samurai? You are expelled. Abe Clan END Subtitles: Maya Grohn corvusalbus & polybar edit
