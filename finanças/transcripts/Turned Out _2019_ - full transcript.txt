You know her girl dick probably bigger than yours. - That might be true, but I promise you, ain't no bitch gonna stroke her shit better than me. See I like girls that like girls, 'cause I'm a freaky-ass dude and I like freaky shit. - See that's why you don't get no pussy, now, 'cause women see you do shit like that, and besides, I done seen her turn down so many dudes. Dudes with money. So what's your broke ass gonna do different? Put her treadmill together? - Imma fuck the dog shit outta her until she falls into a euphoric coma. If a man doesn't have any real goals to accomplish, what's the sense for that man to live? - Are you serious, nigga? Making a lesbian like dick is a real goal?

(upbeat music) - Hi baby! - Hey. - Thank you for picking me up. - It's no problem. - So how was your day? - It was good, we were hanging out, me and Reba, you know, I'm doing good. What? - You know what bitch? You been slipping up an awful lot lately. - I don't know what the hell you talkin' 'bout. - Really? Who the hell lipstick is on your collar? And you know what? Go ahead and lie to me, so I can slap the left cheek off your face through the right side of your mouth. - Bitch, you ever hit me like that, I promise your ass is gonna come up missing immediately. - Why you always trying to play me? I know you cheating on me. - Damn ma, why you be trippin'? It was a friend of mine that I saw earlier that I haven't seen in a while, she gave me a hug. It was me and Reba. - It's always you and Reba. When is it gonna be Stacey and Diamond? Take my fucking ass home. You know what, forget it, I'm just gonna walk. I'm just gonna walk instead. I don't know why you're getting out the fucking car. You know, if I wanted to be cheated on, I'd be dealing with these fucking lame ass men around here. I hate, I really hate the fact that I love you so much, but you know what? That's okay, go ahead, keeping playing and see if this ass whooping that I'm gonna give you don't go viral, and the next bitch, I swear to god, she's gonna fucking learn. - You know what, I'mma call you later. - Don't fucking bother, bitch. - You know what? You right, you right. Hello, Reba? Yo. Fuckin' up, yep, yep, I'm coming over right now. Yeah, alright, alright then. Yo Reba, open up! Yo, open up. - Oh my god bro, what are you doing? - Yo, can I talk? - No, man! - Yo, can I talk first? - No man! - [Stacey] Yo, listen, you're not even listening. - Look, I don't wanna hear it man. - You gotta listen to this. - No man, I don't wanna hear it, you always put me in this shit, bro. - Stop playing with me, yo, just listen! - Goddamn bro, I hope you know what you're getting into, man. - Listen, listen, yo, I'm in the doghouse again! - Oh my god, what the fuck did you do this time? - Shorty saw lipstick on my collar. I didn't even fucking know it was there. - Are you kidding me? Really? You're a grown ass fucking woman, well, woman, woman, whatever. The difference is is that I'm single and you're in a committed relationship. I can come home with lipstick on my collar. You can't. How'd you let this shit happen? - I was with shorty last night, she didn't give me time to take my clothes off when I got there. Good thing I was strapped though. It was late, we fell asleep, and next thing I know, Diamond is texting me to come pick her up from the gym, because she decided to fucking run there this morning. But you right, it's my fault for getting caught up. - Time out, hold up. You tellin' me you had on the same clothes from last night when you went to go pick up Diamond this morning? And you ain't wash your ass? - I didn't have time, I rushed straight out the crib. - I'mma need you to rush your ass straight to the shower. - Whatever bitch, yo if I smell like anything I smell like potpourri, because shorty had the shit on fresh, so fuck what you talkin' about. - You still gonna take that shower though, right? (upbeat music) (dog barking) - Oh shit. - You look like you need a little assistance. - Oh my fucking god, are you stalking me? - Don't flatter yourself shorty, I just moved in the apartments up the block. Lucky you. - Yeah, lucky me. - Stop acting stuck up. Allow me to help you with your bags. - Well thanks, but no thanks. And I ain't stuck up. - That's not what it appears to be right now. - Oh great, another guest. - Yo, what the fuck you doing, man? Yo Diamond, what the fuck is this? - I guarantee you, it ain't what you think. - It sure isn't. - I just moved in up- - Yo, I don't give a fuck where you live, alright? This is my girl, fam. - I get it. Just know her from the gym, she looked like she needed a little assistance, so I figured I'd be a gentleman and help her out. I know if she was my girl, I'd make sure I met her as soon as she stepped foot out the damn door. But it's your world, homie. - Thank you, alright? Look, we're good here. - Stacey, what the hell are you doing here? I didn't say anything about you coming back. - Yo, that's because you don't give me fucking permission to come and go, alright? I come and go as I fucking please, so how about you come and open this fucking door? Yo homie, why the fuck you still standing here? Alright? I don't need you checking shit about mine, you dig, a'ight? - I got you, but you know, what the fuck ever. Y'all have a good night. - Yeah, be out, I'm all on you! (dramatic music) - You need to be all over her, before somebody else is, and stop talking to me like I'm some type of lame. (heartbeat thumping) If you don't remember, you're still a female.

I would do stupid shit like turn them on, get them all nice and hard, and then go home. (laughing) - What a waste. - I just wanted like, get to know their sisters, their female cousins. Get drunk and forget what we did type of shit. I just couldn't see myself lettin' some man up inside me. - Well, what's the difference between dick and a dildo, there's still penetration. - Um, I don't do dildos. For me, it's like when a woman touches you, and how she feels, she touches you how she wants to feel. So like the moment you're together you can feel her skin is so soft, and then she knows like exactly where to put her tongue, it's just like- - Ah, I don't wanna hear about you and Stacey's funky asses, I ain't come over here for that. Look at this, you got this bitch drooping in the fucking chair and shit. I don't get what turns y'all on about bumping uglies, it's just nasty. - Don't knock it till you try it, honey. - The only shit that's gonna knock over here is these walls when my man hitting it right in that with no plastic shit. - Well, it wasn't all cake mix though, Pooch. I mean, for me, it caused a lot of problems in my family, and people that I thought were my friends, they started acting funny towards me. Like if they even thought I was talking to a girl, rumors were going around flying about how I'm fucking her, or I'm liking her, and I tried to explain to them, it's not like that. I mean, we have criteria, we have a preference, it's not like I wanna fuck every woman that walks by, you know? - Yeah, I understand that. - So you say. - And all these strictly dickly bitches- - That would be me. - Whenever they find out, or they know somebody is gay, they make sure they go out their way to let it be known that they don't eat pussy, like bitch, that's why you in the straight category. You can leave us lesbians alone with your weird asses. - You know what my opinion is? You know what you need? Some dick. ♪ And I'm telling you There ain't nothing like it.

I gotta be specific with you, 'cause you might take that shit the wrong way. - Girl, if I wanted your pussy, trust me, I'll get it. - Bitch, my name is not Top Cat, you got me fucked up. - Wait, wait, wait, if he's out there, what are we gonna do if he comes at us? I mean, where we gonna run to? - Run? Girl, that's some white people shit, we don't fucking run, what the hell's wrong with you? - It's okay, we gonna teach you, come on. - Oh shit, we going to jail. - I mean, you could bail us out, right? (Poochie sighs) You okay girl? - Y'all, this is why I can't stand niggas. This is why. Seven years, y'all, seven years, that was my husband y'all, and he goin' throw that away over some pussy he ain't even get. - Well, he was licking the fuck out her shit, though. - Talkin' 'bout he all about me and all this other crap, and that's why I put Bella on him and show people that he ain't shit, niggas ain't shit, I can't. - He's a piece of shit. - Well, you did put a bad bitch on him, I mean, I might of tried to fuck you too, and I don't even get down like that. I'm saying though, you bad as fuck. Bravo bitch, that's a good plan, you know? - You're annoying, I swear. - But it's a silver lining, like she got what she want. - Bitch, let's just go. - What? - [Poochie] I gotta deal with this shit anyway, let's go. Thank you, baby. - Bye, Bella. - You were wearing that dress, looking all sexy and shit. - Diamond. - I'm coming. (soft music) (Poochie crying) - Don't cry, Pooch. You goin' mess your face up. How you gonna get a nigga then? He had a small dick anyway you told me. You too pretty for that. He fucked up, not you. There's plenty of niggas out here, you could have anybody you want. But pussy got the power, and you shouldn't have put that powerful bitch on him. Should've chose like an ugly bitch with a fat ass and no edges, 'cause they definitely out here, not a bitch that got the whole package. Shit, who the fuck would say no to that? Shit, the way she was moaning had my pussy wet, I'm just saying though. - A real man would say no, and why you cuss so damn much? - 'Cause that's what the fuck I do, I cuss. So you gonna get mad at me now 'cause I'm cussing? Shit, bitch, hell, damn, ass, motherfucker, so there. Man, nigga, I'm fucking going in the house, I don't got time for this shit. I'll call you tomorrow, motherfucker. Shit. Damn, fucked up because of that kind of shit. (dramatic music) Mad at me 'cause I'm cussing. Hey. - Hey my ass, where the fuck you been all goddamn day? (dog barking) - Huh? I'm a grown ass woman Rello and my father dead, what the fuck is wrong with you? - Bitch! You don't stay out all goddamn day without checking in with a nigga. - Are you fucking kidding me, Rello? I gotta check the fuck in, but you can stay out as long as you fucking want to? Fuck you, nigga. - Bitch! Every time you disrespect me I'm going to punish you. Disrespect me again. (upbeat music) (dramatic music) (phone vibrating) - Hello? Hey girl. Nothing, on my lunch break at this cafe. Yeah. Yeah, let me call you back though. Okay, a'ight. - Is this seat taken? - Do you see anybody sitting here? - Damn, are you always this mean? - Are you always this annoying? Didn't I see you somewhere? - Oh yeah, so we meet again. - I mean, we didn't meet the first time, so I wouldn't say again pretty boy. - May I sit? - No, I mean you can sit, but it's only gonna make me move somewhere else. - Look, I ain't trying to scare you off or none of that, but before you go, can I at least get your name? - If that's gonna make you disappear, then why not. My name is Poochie, and I'm still not single. - Well look, Poochie, when you ready for somebody to put a smile on your face, why don't you just give me a call? - When you're ready for somebody to sit on your face, you give me a call. - Shit, don't threaten me with a good time. Sherita. Cute name. - Half of y'all could arouse me sexually, physically manipulate my extremities, put me in a good position to have sex with me, but can you penetrate me intellectually? Can you move my body by only standing next to me? Or maybe I gave you the impression that it was okay to do me disrespectfully. Don't return a phone call or a text from me, coming in and out of my life unexpectedly. I'm sorry, but do you see a stupid girl standing next to me? 'Cause clearly you have me confused with one that likes to be treated neglectfully. Or maybe it's not y'all at all, maybe it's me. Maybe I'm so cold and guarded and tainted-hearted, and I gave you a false reality on the things I started. Maybe I allow ones to occupy my mind knowing the expiration date will only be a matter of time. Nina Purhenn. (upbeat music) - What girl can resist this? (laughing) - So this what you been thinking about all day? (phone vibrating) (groaning) - Hello? - I'm hungry. - The hell are you telling me for? Interrupting me for this shit. Take your ass and get something to eat. - I was thinking about taking you up on your offer. - You don't waste no time, do you? Well, eating me can be very addicting, so I was thinking maybe you can feed me first? You know, and then if the day goes by right, maybe I'll decide whether or not you can taste the rainbow. - Feed you first? What you wanna eat, some dick? - Dick? Did this nigga just? I don't eat dick, boy. - So am I meeting you somewhere, or am I picking you up? - Yeah, I got my own car. Shit, I don't know you, and a chick might need to get away immediately, you feel me? - A'ight. We can meet on a boulevard somewhere, like around eight. - Well, that's a start. And one, you're blocked, and trust me, I'm not playing. - Just answer when I call. - Mm-hm. - Bitch don't even know what she in for. Break her ass off, too. - You look nice. Where you going? I'm trying to come. - Shit, I was planning on going out with the fellas around eight. - Typical. You always trying to go hang out with the fellas, but never wanna hang out with me. - Why is it that every time I wanna hang out with the fellas, you wanna do something, but you don't wanna do shit no other time? - I'm always trying to hang out with you Rello, but you too busy going off with the fellas. I'm starting to think you fucking them niggas, 'cause you ain't fucking me, unless you taking my shit. You know what? I can't remember the last time I even got excited looking at your fucking face, but you know what? That's okay. So who is the bitch? - If I was fucking another bitch, it still wouldn't matter because your ass still ain't going nowhere, 'cause the dick too good. - You think I'm with you 'cause you fucking fucking me good? Fuck out of here, nigga, you can kiss my ass. I'm so done with the disrespect. You know what? I'm out of here. You can go fuck whoever the fuck you wanna fuck. - If that's what I chose to do, then so be it, but that's not what's going on, like I'm tired of your accusations about what I'm doing. You know what I'm saying? That shit is fucking me up. That's the type of shit that push a nigga away. - Oh please, you so full of shit. You wanna go, just go, making up reasons to leave the house and shit. Just keep it real with me, like I'm a big girl, I can take it. - Look, you can think what you wanna think. No matter what I say, you're not gonna believe me, anyways, but I suggest you be quiet, 'cause you really irritating the fuck out of me, but didn't you say you was leaving? - Didn't you say your ass was leaving? I don't give a fuck, yeah, you get your wish, bye. - You know what? Maybe your ass shouldn't leave, but in regards to all things, your ass better be back here tonight, not morning, you hear? And while you out, make sure you bring another bitch, so I can fuck the shit out of her, but in the meantime, get the fuck out of my face. - Fuck you. Get the fuck out of here, gonna get dressed. (door closes) - [Man] We're gonna make this really quick you heard? - [Man] I don't want that. (dramatic music) (gun fires) - Oh fuck. (gun fires) He shot the nigga. What? - Make sure you cut your phone off, stupid. - She shot the nigga. - [Woman] Next time bitch, wait till you see, I'll shoot that nigga again. - [Woman] Girl you're... (laughing) - Oh shit. Hello? - What's up girl? - Hey, why you FaceTiming me? - Uh, I wanna see your face. (chuckling) What's up? - You gay. (Poochie chuckling) Gay ass. (Poochie chuckling) - What's up? - Nothing, I'm sitting on the couch. I was all dressed up, ready to go out, but I turned on I got this, now I'm stuck. I have to watch (indistinct) next. What you doing? - Shit, I'm about to go on this date with this fine ass man, girl, and I think he wanna taste the rainbow. - Oh, he told you that already? - That's what he indicated when I met his ass. Girl, I'mma fuck the shit out this nigga face. I'm trying to nut in this niggas nostrils and his eyeballs, bitch. Choke, nigga! (laughing) - Bitch, you stupid, bitch, you stupid. (laughing) Shit, I wish me and my man was doing some freaky shit like that. Wait a minute, I thought you wanted a girlfriend? - I mean, I do, but I'm just testing the waters right now, you know. This guy seems kinda interesting, and Top Cat is no longer a fucking factor, so I'll do what the hell I wanna do. But forget all that though, I'll cancel all this if you let me rub you down. - The fuck? Bitch, anyways, you better not let Top Cat see you, you know he ain't wrapped too tight, right? He catch you, he ain't letting you go that easy. - Top Cat gonna fuck around and get his ass whooped, but listen, you and ya boo should come meet us. You know I need a escape plan, so if this nigga don't do or say the right shit, I'm walking out and leaving that nigga stuck with the bill. (laughing) - Ain't he suppose to pay anyways? - Uh, not after I order a whole bunch of shit I don't want. Every time he say some dumb shit, I'm ordering some dumb shit. You know every nigga hate when a bitch order some shit and don't eat it. (laughing) - Bitch, you stupid. Bitch, you stupid. I'm fucking done. - Yes. - Nah, my man out hanging out with the fellas, so you on your own tonight, call me tomorrow. - I guess, bye. - Later. - It's real nice out here tonight. - Yeah, nice little breeze. So, Mr. Keith, tell me about yourself. You know, you're out on a date with me, so that means you're single, right? - Yeah, I most definitely am single. Been through a lot with women. Tell myself the next time I have to be more careful, can't always trust a big butt and cute smile. I had to learn the hard way. - So you're into fat asses and cute smiles, huh? - I mean, that was at, you know, a certain point in my life, you know, my young, dumb days. - So not to toot my own horn, but beep beep. I got a fat ass and I got a cute smile, so why are we sitting at the table right now? - Hey, every woman is different. It's all about how you carry yourself. But as I said, that's all I was about then. Times have changed, just a little. - Damn, nigga. - What? - You drinking like that is a sign of alcoholism. - Drinking like that is the sign of a stressful day. I'll take it easy on the next one. - That shit is not funny, like how many DWIs you got? - None, I don't drink and drive. - So okay, correct me if I'm wrong. You drove here, right? - Mm-hm. - You just took that down like a motherfucker, 'bout to get another one. Am I missing something here? - Okay, I see where this is going, so let me break it down for you. I'm a 30 year old man. No kids, never been married, very interested in getting to know you. Do I drink? Yes, I drink. Am I alcoholic? Far from it, and I got a very successful job, et cetera, et cetera, but that's not what I'm here for. I'm here for you, so tell me about you. - Okay, well, 28 year old, separated, 'bout to get the divorce. Um, boss bitch, you already know how that works. (laughing) No kids, don't plan on having any, and you know, with the whole no kids thing, most guys find that a turn off, so if that is a turn off, let me know, 'cause I could be up out. I won't waste your time, you know how that goes. - Okay, straight to the point, huh? - Yeah, pretty much. - So, what do you do for fun? - Not much, you know, I hang out with my friends, who are pretty much like me. - Maybe I could meet them one day. - Maybe. (soft music) - You okay? - Yeah, my bad, just thinking about something. Can we order now? Um, I need my food. - Yeah, I was thinking the same thing, I need another drink. - You need another drink, huh? (laughing) (upbeat music) - Next bitch that walks by. - Next bitch that go by, I'mma get a handful of that ass bitch, and she ain't gonna do shit. Man, I'm telling you cuz, these New York bitches be the easiest of them all, man. I can get a handful of cheeks right now. - Steady talking man. - I'm telling you cuz- - I gotta see this shit, man, you know what I'm saying? - These bitches ain't shit up here. - These bitches up here gonna fuck your ass up, man. - Man, you talking that hella trash, man, you extra zesty right now homie, I'm even telling you. (laughing) - Real bitches up here. - The next bitch that come by, I tell you. - They don't play that shit man. - You talking- - You gotta have game, man, you gotta have game, dog. You feel me? - Man, you trippin' homie. Next bitch that go by I'mma get a handful of that ass, bitch. - Okay, yeah nigga. - Yeah, homie. Come on homie, let me get out on your side homie. Come one, come on. - What up dog? - You don't know me, homie. Tell 'em. - You a fool, man, let me see you do that shit up in here, man. - Alright, you'll see. - Yeah, give me an entourage, give me a couple of lukes and all that. Damn, there's something else. Yeah give me a lighter. - Damn. Shorty got a fat ass. - Yo shorty, what's your name? - Can I, can I get a bundle, please? - She knows she hears us, man, I can't stand no stuck up bitch yo. - Yo shorty can get every inch of this dick, what. - Can y'all give me three feet? - Girl, I give you three minutes, my crib, right now. - Why y'all gotta be so fucking disrespectful? And to make a long story short, I'd rather bag your bitch and kick you niggas to the curb, but to keep it simple, you niggas gotta be gay, 'cause ain't no way you could possibly be getting a bitch the way y'all acting. Back the fuck up before I do something to y'all. - Shit. (guys laughing) - She says she's gonna- - Your ass was scared. - Do something to you. (laughing) You better get your hit in first! - This ain't over, man. (guys laughing) Shit. - Oh, boy. - Thank you. - You still think I'm gay? I told you boy, I told you! - Go playa. Go on, get that. (suspenseful music) - What's good, yo? Hold up, oh! - Bitch. Don't touch me, you fucking ass. I don't play that. - Oh, shit! - Stupid. Think your ass will like this stick, nigga? - Oh, shit. - What the fuck you gonna do besides end up like this nigga? - Bitch, is you crazy? - Yeah, that's what the last motherfucker said when he sexually harassed me. You wanna see some more of this crazy shit? - Hell nah, listen baby- - You know what? You look like you about to call the police. I'mma beat your ass. - What the fuck is you trying to? - What you think this is. - Oh, listen, listen- - I'm gonna finish your ass off too. - [Man] Listen, just let me get my man and get him out of here, alright? - Next time you motherfuckers cross my path, you better cross the fucking street. - Okay, you got it. - Better yet, stop disrespecting women! - You got that, you got that. Damn, dude. (engine starts) Crazy bitch! (tires screeching) Psyche, psyche, psyche! Psyche. - Damn. - Fucked you up. - She fucked you up. - Shut the fuck up man.

I didn't like that, you know, I only like you. - You are so full of fucking shit. - You serious, though? Why you gotta be all like that? How about you give yourself a chance to get to know me. Maybe I could do some things that make you think different about me. Give me one night. - Reba, I wouldn't fuck with you with Stacey's dick, and if I was to fuck with any woman, it'd be somebody like Shay, you know, Diamond. Somebody womanly, not nobody manly, like Reba. - Don't do that shit to me. - If that's the case, I have a boyfriend, bitch. - You know what?

Are you serious, Sherita? Like, what makes you think that's gonna go anywhere? For one, she likes dick, and she has a man. - Okay, I know, I know. But like okay, can I be honest with you? We been friends for like ever. - Forever, yes. - And you know I like her, but I'm in love with her, like I really, really like her. I just, don't know what to do, okay? - What to do? How about no, don't do shit. She likes dick! And she has a man! - And that's why I keep my distance, I let her do her, you know what I'm saying, you know? But she really is the only girl I think about. - For real? - And the only girl I think about like that. Like that girl, Jesus Christ, like I literally think about her when I'm in bed with Top Cat. - Shut up, really? - Yes, bitch, this girl serious. - So, do you like masturbate to her? - Yeah, bitch, I still do, the fuck you talking about? - Oh shit girl, you have it bad. You might wanna take some advice. I'm not sure, because I am staying out of this one. - I got it bad, I know, Jesus Christ. Don't judge me. - I don't. I never saw someone hit the floor so fucking hard, wait till we tell Shay, I swear. I never seen someone hit the floor so hard. - Alright, I heard y'all bitches from the driveway, what y'all doing here? (girls laughing) - Hey. - We're here now, how you doing? - I'm fine, I'm fine, where we going, where we going? - Oh my god. - Sherita, stop looking at my ass, I expect that shit from Diamond, but bitch, you tripping. - Mm, shit.

I do got a life outside of you, Rello. - Bitch, I asked you a question. - Them Diamond's friends, she was scared to talk to the nigga so I just went and got them for her, that's all it was, Rello. - I'mma need you to call into work today. - I'm not doing that, you don't pay none of my bills. As a matter of fact, we need to take a break, 'cause all you wanna do is put your hands on me and I'm not feeling that shit. (gun cocks) - Bitch, you must be ready to die.

Better yet, what's up with one of your friends? - You fucking kidding me? Let me out of this car. - Bitch, if I can't have you, what makes you think I'mma let the next nigga have you? We in this shit for life. - Rello, what part of I don't want you don't you get? - You know what, better yet, how 'bout I take you back to where I just picked you up from and then we can question the niggas myself? - Yo, just let me out this car, like right here. - That's my girl. (dramatic music) - [Shay] Stop, stop! - [Woman] Too often, it's so sadly, most of us wanna be loved so badly that we're willing to sacrifice our soul for a distorted perception of what makes us happy. I learned, as a woman, I should never be mad at a man for the way he chooses to act. I need to reevaluate myself and what it is that I lack that I allow that man to treat me like that. In return, most people think I make decisions based upon pride, I just know if I deserve more than you're able to provide I could put those feelings aside and keep it moving like you're not alive, see you be like that sometimes. So many of us are quick to settle for the average, that said, if the only climax you bring is on a mattress, then me and you should never be established. - This bitch got me out here losing my motherfucking mind, user located this shit?
