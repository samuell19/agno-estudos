The fire titans of Tennessee are swinging for the fences with two outrageous rigs that can hang with the best of them. I start in Lebanon for a feast of fowl. Chef Trey Cioccia cooks whole ducks that are stuffed with citrus and aromatics, suspended around a burning tower of coals and cooked until juicy perfection. Duck, duck, cabbage. Then I make my way to Nashville, where a swing set has been transformed into a multilevel cooking contraption. Local butchers James Peisker and Chris Carter cook rib roasts hanging from chains and sear sausages over a movable grill. Make it swing, baby! Look at that. That's so cool! ♪♪ In Nashville, Tennessee, the food scene is just as lively as the music scene. Chef Trey Cioccia is fanning the flames at two restaurants and breathing new life into Southern classics. Trey invited me to Wedge Oak Farms in Lebanon, which is a half an hour outside of Nashville. He's bringing his rigs, building fires and cooking a farm-to-fire-to-table feast. I'm bringing my appetite. All right, Trey, man, this thing is pretty cool. I'm seeing all kinds of stuff, places to hang stuff, a kind of chimney in here. Walk me through how this thing works. CIOCCIA: This is our cauldron with a burn barrel. We're going to load wood in the top. It's going to produce coals to keep the bottom of the cauldron hot, evenly disperse through your protein. It's also going to heat this barrel up right here, too and allow radiant heat to come out while we're cooking. So if you're hanging stuff here, its proximity to this is going to heat it, as well, to cook it. Sure, and we can bring it in or out. That's why we have all these, so if we need to go closer, we can bring closer. If we need to come away, we can come away. You got some pots and pans to cook on. Very dynamic, man. I love it. Today, we're going to be hanging some ducks. Whoa, whoa, whoa. You said, "Ducks"? Ducks. Duck is, like, my favorite thing on Earth. It has such a distinct kind of sweet, nutty flavor, so rich and full. The skin gets crispy if you cook it proper. We're definitely going to cook it proper today, my man, and then once we get closer to the end, down in these pans, we going to make some succotash. I love succotash. It has lima beans. It has corn in there, finish it with a little cream and butter, ooh, just so delicious, so we're in good shape here today, man. How do we get started? We going to start a fire, baby. We're going to get you to get some cardboard, and we're going to stuff it inside this chimney here, and then once we get all that done, we're going to start throwing some of this kindle on top of it. What kind of of wood we going to add to this to really get it going? We got some hickory. It's indigenous to Tennessee. It's what I learned to smoke on. I like this hickory because it's a nice neutral wood. It allows the flavor of whatever you're cooking to actually stand out, and it's not too smoky. All right. We got our super chimney loaded, got my favorite part of the day. Light it up. ♪♪ I can see what you mean about emanating heat. I already feel it. -I feel it, too, man. You smell that hickory, man? We already getting some coals dropping. Are we going to mess with this burn barrel too? Absolutely. So when we got our grills over here and cooking our corn, we got some coals to shovel in there. Basically, this burn barrel is just a giant version of the one that's on the contraption over there. ♪♪ Imagine my luck. We get to start two fires today. ♪♪ All right, them things are raging pretty good. How long before we got coals we can cook with? About an hour or so, let them coals drop down, so we can get in and prep some food up. All right, so we got some oregano here, some rosemary, some thyme and, of course, orange, which is an all-time classic favorite love affair with duck, right? Absolutely, man. Have you done anything to these ducks? We took a little salt, rubbed it inside the cavity. That dries it out a little bit, kind of get more kind of an age to it. You're seasoning from the inside out, which really helps with the flavor a lot. Absolutely. That's why we're going to get you to stuff these things with all these herbs and citrus. It's going to be nice. We're going to take the herbs, break them up a little bit, get those oils released, take some citrus. We're going to kind of shove it up in that cavity, so all that juice and moisture inside that duck is going to hit that, and it's just going to try to -- pretty much make its own little stock in its own little belly. And do you like to season it on the outside, as well? Yeah, I like to just basic, man, salt and pepper. I'm going to flip the bird over. So I'm just going to take these wires. We're going to go across the backside here and then truss it here, and we're going to do this little loop-around knot right here. We're going to be able to hang them flat, be able to rotate them up like this. ♪♪ Can't help but notice you got some purple cabbage over there. Yeah, we've just seasoned the cabbage with a little olive oil, salt and pepper, keep it really simple. Purple cabbage goes really well with the duck, so we're going to take that and kind of fold into that succotash when we're done with them. All right. It's good to go, man. Let's get it over the fire. -Let's get it over there. ♪♪ Those ducks look amazing, man. They look good. Don't they, man? Yeah, Let's get those cabbages. Let's do it. So we're going to cook these purple cabbages at the same time as the duck, and hopefully, we're going to get a nice char outside and nice soft, tender inside. We're going to let those go for about an 1 1/2 hours, 2 hours, rotate it every 20 minutes just to kind of get that skin nice and evenly cooked. Is there anything you're going to do to the duck while you're spinning it around? -Yeah. We going to baste it a little bit. I got a little mop of some fresh herbs, some maple, and rice-wine vinegar, so it's going to crisp it up, make it look beautiful. Man, I can already smell this meal. Soon, I'll be tasting it. It's going to be good. Coming up, this crispy moist duck will be flying onto the plate and into my belly. ♪♪ I'm out here in Lebanon, Tennessee, with my man, Trey Cioccia. Now, Lebanon is 30 minutes outside of Nashville, where my man, Trey, has two restaurants that feature wood-fire cooking, but right now, we're at Wedge Oak Farms. These ducks right here are looking delicious. CIOCCIA: We've taken some fresh herbs, some oregano, some thyme, some rosemary, broke them up a little bit, some fresh citrus, stuffed that cavity, nice salt-and-pepper crust on the outside. We've basted them two or three times. It's got some maple. It's got a little rice-wine vinegar, some garlic. Nice, and we put on these purple cabbage at the same time, and we're going to be using that cabbage for a succotash, which is basically sauteed lima beans, some corn, and what else are you going to put in there? We're going to put some tomatoes, some fresh herbs, a little bit of cream. It's going to be good. -All right, man. So what have you done to the grill back here? So I took that big old burn barrel, got a couple loads of shovels of coals down there, spread them out real nice, threw a couple logs, let them catch a little bit, so when we put this down, it's going to give it a nice little kiss on that corn. ♪♪ -All right, already, we're getting a good sizzle on that corn. How long should that take? We can probably -- About 15, 20 minutes, nice. We just want it to warm that corn up because we're going to put it back in those pans again anyways and get those cooking. ♪♪ So Trey, over there, is just kind of shredding up the purple cabbage, and I'm just taking the kernels off of the cobs, and you can already see a very vibrant-colored dish. It's going to taste delicious, too. ♪♪ All right, man, well, it is succotash time right now. You know, we got this cast-iron pan heating up. It's smoking hot over here. We got lima beans. We got cubed-up bacon that you made, tomatoes. We got cream, herbs, shallots, salt, pepper. So what do you want to start with? Let's start with this bacon. Just going to sweat it a little bit. Nice. So sweating, basically, we don't want it to get too brown and crunchy, but we do want to render down that fat because that fat is going to help cook the rest of the stuff. Shallots? -Shallots, let's do it. Shallots are basically like small onions, slight garlicky flavor. So I'm putting in the corn, right into the fat. I want that to kind of start sizzling as soon as it hits the pan. Looks like it's time for these beans, man. You know, these lima beans are one of my favorite beans. They're a very hearty bean. It's a good size, so it's something to chew on. It's substantial, but also, they're very tender and creamy. What kind of herbs you got here? So we've just got some regular Italian parsley and some fresh thyme. You know, immediately, them herbs come to life, man. The oils come out of them. It just livens it up. I'm going to give you some of this cream, and we'll get this in there. ♪♪ So now, we're going to hit it with these tomatoes. Man, that smells incredible right there. Pass that cabbage. ♪♪ All right, man, so that succotash, perfect, that looks gorgeous, man. It's ready. It's vibrant. It's colorful. It's summertime, baby. ♪♪ I'm telling you, man, these birds are cooked perfectly. Thank you, man. Yo, y'all ready to eat? ALL: Yeah! ♪♪ Get in there, man. Look at that succotash. -That's awesome. -Right, right? [ Indistinct conversations ] ♪♪ Man, I'm going straight at this duck, man. This looks delicious. Mm. That right there is some good duck, nice brown skin, got a little crunch to it. I get the herbed flavor and the orange flavor from inside. I get the maple and the smoke on top. That is spectacular. I feel you. I feel good about it, man. -That is -- -Nice, nice bite. I think I outdid myself. [ Laughs ] Now, if that succotash is anything like that duck, it's going to be a great, great day. [ Clicks tongue ] I'm really happy you added the cabbage to that. I was going to say. It's got that crunch. It's super nice. The sweetness of the cabbage really come out, a little char from the exterior bits that are kind of dancing through there. The bacon is incredible in that. That is a really good succotash, man. I'm a fan of succotash, and that one definitely makes the mark. -It's a good bite. -Mm. You keep cooking like this, you might just see me with a little hut out in the woods over there. That's cool. I'll put one next to you. We'll just cook in the middle. That is ridiculous. Coming up, I'm hanging out with two butchers who are giving new life to an old swing set. That meat is beautifully seared on all sides. ♪♪ I'm in Nashville, Tennessee, meeting up with two butchers who have some serious chops. James Peisker and Chris Carter are the owners of Porter Road. It's a butcher shop that sells meat from small farms. They break down whole animals, dry-age beef, and make artisanal sausages. They believe that to be a good butcher, you need to experiment with different cuts and different cooking methods. So they'll take some of the meats to Chris' house, cook it over a live fire, invite over some family and friends for a feast. That's the kind of quality control I could get down with. ♪♪ You know, I travel all across the country, and I'm kind of noticing this wave of butcher shops. When I was coming up, we used to just go to the grocery store. So what made you want to go back to the old-fashioned ways? We started as chefs, and we know quality, and we just couldn't find good meat anywhere, so we knew we had to fix that issue first. You're really getting just a better quality thing, right? Absolutely. Yeah. Everything we do is 100% pasture-raised, no antibiotics, no hormones ever. All of our beef is dry-aged for a minimum of 14 days, so that means even our burger meat is a 14-day-dry-aged burger, which is going to be delicious, amazing and something like you've never had before. I understand that you have this kind of official, unofficial test kitchen for the butcher shop in your backyard, which is pretty amazing. It is a little slice of heaven. We recently pulled an old swing set out of the woods, turned it into a meat cooker, too. -It's a meat swing. -Meat swing. Yo. Let's go play with this swing set, man. MOOKING: While Chris mans the butcher shop, James and I will start swinging some meat. This is an actual, actual swing set from a legit playground where I would be pushing my kids, right? Absolutely, so this is an old metal swing set. The A-frame swing set is going to give us a nice brace to hold some heavy weight on it. -Yep. We have a 2-by-3-foot swing grate right here. We build the fire underneath the entire thing on those pavers. -Yeah. And then we have the three sets of chains right here -- one really low, a medium, and a high. Very low is the sear level. Very high is the resting or the waiting. So what are we going to be cooking on this setup here today, man? Today, we have a few rib roasts that are going to go on there. Wow. I love rib roast. And then we have some homemade sausages, and then we're going to make this really wonderful, nice radicchio salad. too. We start by building a fire? Absolutely. So, Roger, I like to start with a nice thin layer of lump charcoal. ♪♪ MOOKING: All right, man, you've got some stuff here that I've never seen before. What's this all about? So this is our insulation that we ship our meat in. It's actually made out of corn, and because of the shape of them, they let air flow very well in between your charcoal. -All right. So basically, it's going to help light this fire and keep it lit. Absolutely. And then we'll put another little layer of charcoal right on top. You know, James, my favorite part of the day right now -- I get to light it up. ♪♪ So now that we have a little bit of fire, we're going to start adding some wood. So we use a local cherrywood. The cherrywood is a much more mild fruitwood. The subtleness of the cherry is important to us because we are a butcher shop, and we're all about the meat. Totally makes sense, man. You want to taste that meat. ♪♪ I got to tell you. This is one of my all-time favorite cuts of meat like this, rib roast. It's hearty. It's cooking on the bone, super flavorful, and it can take quite a lot of seasoning, yeah? Yeah, it can, but when you start with a quality cut of meat like we do... -Yeah. -...we like to keep it very simple -- just salt and pepper. ♪♪ What kind of salt and what kind of pepper we got here? So we like to use kosher salt, and we did a pepper blend, so it's a mixture of black pepper, red pepper, pink pepper, and white pepper. -Nice. So the red pepper is a little bit spicy. The pink pepper normally is reserved for fish or seafood because it has a little bit of a floral note, and, of course, everybody is familiar with black and white pepper. Absolutely delicious, wonderful, and classic. We got to make sure that we get this as close to the fire as possible without burning to make sure we sear the exterior because that's going to add a lot of flavor, and then we can raise it up and finish the cooking. ♪♪ That meat is beautifully seared on all sides. I'm going to raise it up, so it cooks at a more moderate temperature. ♪♪ All right, so how much longer is that going to take to cook? About 2 more hours. Now, you promised me sausages and stuff. Where is that? Yeah, so Chris is on his way back from the butcher shop. He'll start to man this meat, and we can finish up this dinner. All right. And don't forget the veggies. This is going to be delicious. Coming up, this swing set is not playing around when it comes to open-fire cooking. Nice! That's looking great. It's a really hot fire. ♪♪ I'm out here with James Peisker and Chris Carter from Porter Road butcher, here, in Nashville, Tennessee. Chris here has been gracious enough to let us take over his beautiful backyard and cook on his swing set. That is an actual swing set. We're hanging rib roasts, and we've rubbed it with salt and four kinds of peppercorns. All right. So that's cooking for about an hour now. How much longer does this got to go? About another hour. I got to tell you, man, it smells incredible right here, super beefy. That fat is kind of coming down, kissing up that cherrywood. The aroma is great, but they promised me sausages and some vegetables, so let's divide and conquer. Chris and I are going to deal with the beef, and then my homie, James, here, is going to start the sausage and the vegetables, and maybe we'll jump in and help him. -Sounds good. -All right. Let's get it. All right, we just got to flip it and rotate it. You got it. Man, this rib roast is looking ri-donk-ulous. ♪♪ So how are we going to prepare this radicchio? We're just going to do a little bit of grapeseed oil, salt, black pepper, char it up on the grill. Nice! That's looking great. It's a really hot fire. All right, and we got the chorizo and kielbasa. What's in each of these? The kielbasa is one of my favorite. We start with pasture-raised pork right in Kentucky, fresh garlic, fresh oregano, salt and black pepper. The chorizo, we get the smokiness from the ancho, get the spiciness from the cayenne and that little bit pepperiness from the garlic. I can basically see and taste this whole meal coming together right in front of me right now. I got to tell you, it's a special thing, and why have a swing if you don't swing the swing? It's a playground. Look at that! That's so cool! How you like to put this radicchio salad together? So we just simply chop up the charred radicchio, and then we mix it with some nice shaved radishes, some baby kale, a little bit of red-wine vinegar and some nice dollops of yellow mustard. ♪♪ Man, that rib roast is just looking gorgeous, cooked perfectly. It's just such a special thing when it's over an open fire. ♪♪ What's up, man? You got to get a little bit of both of those sausages right there. [ Indistinct conversations ] ♪♪ I'm going to go after this rib roast first. That outside crust is nice from the sear and all that seasoning on there. It turned out just perfect, and I can taste how rich it is because you dry-aged it. It's such a deep, beefy flavor. It couldn't be more perfect. I'm not going to lie. Let's try the chorizo because I love chorizo. I taste the pork. I taste all the spices and just a little mild heat. That's really, really good. I'm going in on this kielbasa now, dog. The snap on the sausage is just perfect, but I love that it's so robust with the garlic, you know? I love it. -Appreciate it. Yo, but I'm also a fan of vegetables, so let's see how that radicchio turned out. ♪♪ Mmm. You know, the kale adds a lot of body to it. -Yeah. -I definitely get the mustard. -Yeah. -Obviously I get the vinegar in there, and, yo, that radicchio, that little bit of bitterness is like the perfect little hit with the rest of the stuff in here. Yo, James, man, it's been great cooking with you. Chris, great cooking with you. Thanks for sharing your yard with us like this. Absolutely, man. It means a lot to me, man, when somebody does it right like this. It's good company. We have fun. It's a great day at the office. -Yep. -Yeah. Envy your job, sir.
