Intruder alert... zone three. Intruder alert... zone three. Drop whatever you've got and turn around slowly. Careful, officer. It's just a camera. Would you mind if I simply lay it down over here? Don't! Bloody hell! I gave you fair warning. You should have listened. A security guard. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Police arrested a foreign national suspect on charges of industrial espionage, in a pre-dawn shooting. Oh, yeah! - Goddammit, Jesse! - Nothin' more stupid in the world, than pointing a gun, with no intention of using it. I could've blown your ass away! All I did was liberate the last of your beer, homeboy. I hate it when you call me homeboy! Worse than that, you're a day early. Bitch and moan. Bitch and moan. It's good to see you anyway, asshole. You too, man! Now that you have that male bonding out of the way, what do I have to do to get a cup of coffee around here? Lisa, listen, could you do me a favor and take the car back to the airport? - Sure. - I'm not gonna tell you to go. - It's alright. - I'm Will. - Hi. Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - So you gonna call soon? - Yeah, next week. Alright. Bye. They really do try harder. I've got something for you. You mean, that she and I... Hey, man, I'm the security business. Oh, my goodness. You may want to keep that for a little souvenir. No, it's alright. You hang onto it. You might learn something. You know, she had one other good idea. How about some coffee? - How about breakfast? - Even better. And you! You're fired, Butch. I could get used to this lifestyle in a minute. It's just low maintenance. Your life isn't so bad. It wasn't bad. I was working my way to the top in the military. Now I gotta start right back at the bottom again. - Damn, man! What'd you do to this coffee? - Cajun recipe. Chicory, raw egg, and the shells. Bayou expresso. Wait a minute. Isn't that foul stuff you used to make in the air force? Hey. Don't go bustin' my coffee like that. Not when we're about to become partners again. - What do you mean, partners? - The thing is, I taught you everything you know. You taught me some things, but you sure as hell didn't teach me everything. I got my savings. Pension. - How about you let me buy into this operation? - Get outta here! Why not? You know, we could even talk about franchise. It just the last thing I need in my life right now is a partner. I've got everything just the way I want it. Partners only complicate things. Complicate? I was looking to complement that's how it works with friends. Where're you goin'? I'm going upstairs to change those nasty sheets, and try to get some sleep. What's got you wound up so tight, Man? Look, don't push it. That's how it works with friends. Certainly, certainly. Yes, I agree. Yes, as soon as I officially open the consulate. And thank you. Goodbye. That, my dear, was none other than Herman Talbot of the state department. He wanted to be the first, to officially welcome us to the United States. You know, this is my old neighborhood. I used to live over that hill. You know, I think it would be a good idea if we were to invite him to dinner. I should take you up to Mulholland. We used to go make out up there. Yes, that will be my first official act as consul general. Marilyn. Luis? Hector. I want you to call Talbot's secretary. I want to know the name of his favorite restaurant. Let's go to the house. Ready? Once I'm inside the house, you can follow. It's me they're after. I'll cover for you. The gun jammed. I just got it to work. We've been in this country for two hours, and already someone's been shooting at us. In our own hall. - I'm sorry... - Where is Luis? Why isn't he here? How could they have followed us here? Luis. You can put it away. He's dead. Would you mind telling me how you managed to get this into the country? Diplomatic pouch. These security procedures were approved by Herman Talbot, of the state departement. Now, you can confirm this with him. That's T-a-l-b-o-t? Of course he'll want to know why you're wasting your time investigating my people, instead of the terrorists of my country. Well, the fact that your chief of security just killed our only suspect, doesn't give us help a lot to go on. What are you gonna do about protecting us in the mean time? I've made arrangements for couple men to patrol the street, and I will put a couple men at the front gate as well. That's not good enough. What's gonna stop them from coming over the back wall? If that's a genuine concern of yours, I would suggest you get some kind of security system to this place. - What do you suggest? - That's not something my department does. But I do have a friend who's a specialist if you interesting. Good. I'll take his name. We have Luis. His people will be here next week. - We don't want outsiders here. - Next week will be too late, Hector! That's how you reach him. Marilyn, please be reasonable. I do not want our house looking as though we're under a siege. Well you either make sure we're fully protected as soon as possible, or I'm leaving! Marilyn. Marilyn, please. You run a nice, tight little operation out of here, man. Of course, this place would never pass a white-glove inspection. Would you lighten up, Jesse? You're a civilian now. Don't remind me, man. It's all turned around out here in the real world. Little rough and tumble. Nobody lookin' out for you but... Where'd this clown learn how to drive? Nine-millimeter. Gravity drop shoulder holster. I taught you well, didn't I? Be careful with this guy. - Senor Griffith? - That's me. I'm Luis Perez. Aide to Consul General Hector Mejenes. A policeman, Sgt. Turner, recommended you to us. Look, I'm sorry, but I'm taking a little time off right now. - This is an emergency situation. - What kind of emergency? - Just a minute, Jess. - Well, let's hear what the man has to say. It would require a full complement of surveillance equipment, an alarm system, and of course briefing my personnel when they arrive. Piece of cake. Tell him we'll do it. Would you excuse us just a minute? - Why are you pushing me into this? - Look, Will, let me have my shot. I mean, a gig like this would put me back on track. All right. You just remember, I run the show. Gives you something to do, man, beside bringing strange women into my house, stealing my beer, ruining my dog. Mr. Perez, I think we can talk. It's a pleasure. Park here. You'll be using the servants' quarters. You got it. Servants' quarters? - Servants' quarters? - You wanted the job. You know something, if it weren't for you, I'd be out of here right now. Off in a beautiful mountain stream, reeling in some of the biggest trout you've ever seen, man. Bitch and moan, bitch and moan. You think this is my whole life? Got some land up north. Building a place from ground up. Yeah, when we're finished with this, man, why don't you invite me up there sometimes to see it. Huh? I don't know. It's kind of quiet for you. No noise, no traffic, no women. Maybe not. Thank you for attending to our crisis on such short notice. I am Consul General Hector Mejenes. Will Griffith, Night Eyes Security. And? - This is my new associate, Jesse Younger. - Nice to meet you. We worked together in the air force, special investigations office. I taught him everything he knows. Your head of security explained that there was an attack here yesterday. Yes, and thanks to Luis, my wife and I are lucky to be alive. Nevertheless, we have decided to have a security system installed throughout our house. But, no uniforms and no visible weapons. Now, Luis already has a plan laid out for you to follow. Of course we'll cover all the doors and windows, but I'd also like to install series of interior traps, ultrasonic motion detectors, pressure pads, maybe even some exterior infrared beams. This will go along with full cover of video surveillance, and I can also offer you 24-hour audio monitoring, if you'd like. Absolutely not! I do not want official consulate business recorded. I understand. Now, all the other equipment, that will be sufficient. Don't worry. We'll rig a system as tight as your... By tomorrow afternoon, I guarantee everybody will be breathing easier. Let's go. Here would be good. Maybe another one over there by the door to cover the door. Are you sure Mr. Mejenes wants a camera in his bedroom? Every room. No exceptions. Whatever you say. Do you always sneak up on people like that? I'm sorry. I tried to get your attention, but the music was too loud. - You are? - Will Griffith. Oh, right. The one Sgt. Turner recommended? Right. Just give me a minute to install this camera, I'll be out of your way. Fine. I'm finished anyway. Sorry. Excuse me. Look, I'm sorry I snapped at you. I've been on edge ever since yesterday. That's all right, I understand. They filled me in on what happened. I appreciate what you're doing. Would you available to provide personal protection for me whenever I leave the house? What about your husband's security man? Well, I'm afraid his loyalties are with my husband. I'm gonna need someone, just for me. She said, "I need somebody to be there for me." - Just like that? - Word for word. - She just gave you the job? - Yeah. Lucky son of a bitch. - So, what's she like? - I don't know yet. I get the feeling there's a strain between her and her husband. - You haven't answered my question. - You're right, I haven't. I want you wanna bet, they're not getting it on anymore? - What do you mean? Give it up. - Let me tell you. Nothing kills romance quicker than a good dose of marriage. Now, romance... that's a whole different ball game. Tell me about it. I learned my lesson a long time ago. I guess I should call her over. I think she's got a friend for you. You go ahead, man. I'm beat. This is not the Will Griffith I know. Is this thing working? Not until tomorrow night, when Senor Griffith will also start as your personal security. A camera in our bedroom? You were the one that demanded this increase in security. And it's only going to be until Luis' people can take over. I guess that gives us one more night alone. I'm trying to work. Listen to me. Stop. Don't. I said to stop! I will not be obligated to perform for you. I don't want you to perform for me, Hector. I just want you to love me. Your reservation at the Hotel Internacionale has been confirmed. Luis, thank you. If you could please have someone make copies of this, it is the speech I'm to give at the conference. Of course. But I think you should take a look at this. Again, they're saying that you're using your wife's money, to promote your career and influence. We knew that this was going to be a problem. So my friend, tell me. How can we rectify this? Well, the least you could've done, man, was to say hello, you know, I mean, show a little courtesy. I just don't feel up to it. I want to get some sleep. We go on night duty tonight. She told her girlfriend how stuck-up you were and they're both mad at me. What you're telling me is you didn't get lucky. If I'm a little cranky, it's your fault! Consul general wants to know when you'll be finished. Well, I explained to Senor Mejenes that everything would be functional by this afternoon. I am the head of security here. You report to me. He's got a serious attitude problem. Forget him, man. Let's get this job done. I tell you what, why don't you install today. I'll cover the monitors. Man, I worked hard enough last night. No payoff. Bitch and moan, bitch and moan. First floor... secure. Second floor... secure. Secure. Intruder alert. Intruder alert... zone eight. Intruder alert... zone eight. Intruder alert... zone eight. Intruder alert. Freeze! Intruder alert... zone eight. Shut it down, Will. I've got the area secured. Talk to us. My job is to test security. Mr. Perez. Every system has a backup, like the one you just walked into. It's my trademark. I'll reset the alarm. Very good. Very good. Second floor... secure. What's the matter? - Try straighten your leg. - I can't. - Yes, you can. - I can't. Flex your foot. Straighten the leg. Is that it? - Yeah, yeah. - Just a minute. Doesn't feel like you pulled anything, but I think you got yourself one hell of a 'charley horse'. That's better. Thanks. Good. That's better. You have good hands. If I may, I would like to say a few words about loyalty and friendship, which by your presence here this evening, Senor Talbot, as representative of the state department, confirms that these are the bonds... which link our two countries together. 'A nuestra fidelidad y amisted'. Loyalty and friendship. Get ready. They're gonna start hurling compliments at one another. This administration has indicated to me... that they anticipate an improvement in relations. First, I must win the election... and then I can guarantee reforms. But our research shows that your president has a very popular follower. By promising everything but prosperity. Now, I have spoken with the business leaders and the industrialists, and they favor a free-trade market. If that faction could bring pressure to be in public opinion, it would influence the elections. Now, that I can guarantee. Why don't the two of you cut out the crap, and lay your cards on the table? What my husband is saying is, if you can get elected president, by hook or by crook, this country is going to back you to the hill top. For all the oil they can wring out of you. Bravo. Bravo, Senora! The problem with diplomats is they just love the sound of their own voice. You can't shut 'em up. The other problem is, it takes forever to goad them into action. You don't look to me like you waste time talking. I'm probably more prudent than you might think. Really? What do you do? Senor Griffith owns his own security company. So he's a bodyguard? Well, now I am glad that I insisted we have him at the table. There's nothing like a personal touch when it comes to protection. Mostly I protect property. Like the young marines who guard our embassies? Nothing makes a woman weak like a man in uniform. Am I right? That's enough, Vivian. Maybe we should call it an evening. Now? So early? Herman, you can't let them get away without showing them Los Angeles. I suppose not. You want to dance, don't you? Take in some music, loosen up. Are you saying that we are... 'como se dice aburridas'? Boring. Boring? Well, I'm giving you an opportunity to redeem yourself. And you don't have to stay prudent the entire evening, do you? Is there a place that you would care to recommend? There's a private club on sunset that I could get us into. You know, I've been fighting this headache all evening. If you don't mind... Certainly, my dear. We'll take you straight home. Please go on without me. Don't spoil your evening on my account. - Senor Griffith, would you mind? - Yes, I'd be delighted to drive her home. Mr. Talbot, pleasure. Mrs. Talbot, Luis. Good night, dear. Tell me, would you say you're the strong, silent type? "Los Angeles." You definitely owe me a big one. Saved from a fate worse than death. No doubt about that. Oh, God. I hope I never become like that woman. What makes you think you ever could? The bitterness. A lot of what she has to say about politicians and diplomats is pretty close to the truth. I gotta get out of these clothes. You know, I may just be fooling myself into thinking that someday being the wife of a president would be glamorous. I don't know. As long as you don't end up like that woman tonight. There are probably a lot more Mrs. Talbots than you realize, They all married to men so consumed by their own ambitions. In the end of the day, there's little left to share. - It's a lot of power. - Yeah. Part of you must think it's worth it. Ask me when I'm 'first lady'. You didn't seem that uncomfortable tonight. That's my public face. Smiling 'til your cheeks ache, searching for the proper word, perfect gesture, to make everyone feel at ease. So what's the private face like? I don't know, I forgot. I used to have one. I came from an incredibly wealthy family. I was an only child, sent to an all-girls school in La Jolla, complete with uniforms. We were taught how to be proper young ladies. Of course, me being the rebel. I used to sneak out of the dorm and I go hang out with the surfers. - Come on. - I was a little more impetuous then. When I was expelled, my parents were devastated. Too bad they couldn't be around to see how disgustingly respectable I've become. What? You call this respectable? May I remind you, this is the future first lady you're talking to. We'd better get inside before somebody comes home. We'd have a lot of explaining to do. It's cold! You can change in the master bathroom. - You sure it's okay? - Yeah. You may or may not need these. Don't even start with me, man. First floor... secure. Yeah? I brought you some more towels. I'll leave them on the floor. Thanks. Intruder alert... zone five. Intruder alert... zone five. Intruder alert... zone five. Intruder alert... zone five. - Marilyn? - Will, look out! Stay down. Don't go gettin' all teary-eyed yet. Just busted a couple of ribs. That's all. Damn, it hurts! Call 911. Get an ambulance right here. Okay. Just hang on. You just hang in there, man. I want you to keep tabs on him for me, Turner. I will. No problem. Listen, how soon can you come down to the station and make a statement? As soon as the consul general gets back, I'll have his security take over. All right. Here. I got the intruder on videotape. You might want to have a look at it. Hey. You okay? Yeah. Will? You think it's your fault, don't you? I told Jesse that I didn't want any partners. I didn't want the responsibility. I just didn't want something like this to happen. It's not your fault. You'd better get upstairs. I arrive as soon as I can. How is your friend? I won't know 'til I get to the hospital. - And my wife? - Upstairs, safe. How could something like this have happened? Somehow the assailant knew enough to get around the backup systems! Any alarm can be beaten, Mr. Mejenes, as long as the intruder knows the setup. I would not make wild accusations, Senor Griffith. You may succeed in embarrassing yourself. I'll tell you what's embarrassing, Sir. We've got a leak. My partner's been shot and your wife almost killed! When you're ready to deal with it, let me know. Sorry, sir. Visiting hours are now over. I don't believe it. Marilyn, what the hell are you doing? You shouldn't be out here alone. I've had this argument already tonight with my husband, Will. I wanted to go to hospital to see how Jesse was doing, and I saw you leaving. Jesse pull through fine. Now, I want you get in the car and go back to the house. I'll follow behind you to make sure you get there safely. I also wanted to make sure you were all right. I'm doing just fine. I mean, really all right. Marilyn. Marilyn, go back where you belong. Be so respectable. - - e - e i - e i f - e i f a - e i f a n - e i f a n s - e i f a n s c - e i f a n s c l - e i f a n s c l u - e i f a n s c l u b - e i f a n s c l u b - - e i f a n s c l u b - - e i f a n s c l u b - What? For a long time I did a pretty good job of keeping people at a distance, just so I could be alone. I worked nights, slept days. Uncomplicated my life. Who was she? A client. I broke the cardinal rule. I let myself get involved. My feelings take control. And you got burned. Yeah. Burned my life. I knew it. Knew what? You're not fooling anyone. You're more vulnerable than you think. Sensitive is more like it. Give it a minute. Hey. Hey, man. I dug these out of your duffel bag, had 'em dry clean. Thanks. You'll be lookin' good when you get out of here. How are you feeling? They promised me the south would rise again. I'm serious. I'm gonna pull through. No sweat. The silencer that guy used on me was homemade. You know, one of those tin-can jobs, packed with steel wool. - You saw it? - Heard it. They're no good after two or three pops. It really fucks up the trajectory too. Luckily for me. Damn! I shouldn't have taken this job. Man, don't go blaming yourself for this. I knew what I was walking into. Hell, If anything, I pushed you into it. I am still pissed off at you, though, for bustin' up what I had going on with that girl at the bar. How's the wife doing? Fine. She's... holding it together. She asked me to tell you she really appreciates what you did. And so do I. Nothin' to it, man. You watch yourself, okay? I'm fine. Bullshit! I got eyes, man. I can see that you are well on your way to dicking yourself. Yeah, well, I didn't come here to be lectured by you. Just be thankful I'm too weak to put my foot up your ass. That'd be the day. Get outta here. Senor Mejenes wants to see you. Tell him I'll be right there as soon as I put this tape in. Now! I said I'll be right there when I finish the job. Why bother? You almost got the Senora killed. Then you put your friend in the hospital. Well, where were you, Luis? Getting down with Mrs. Talbot? You don't want to fuck with me, Luis. You tell Senor Mejenes I'll be there in a minute. You need to use the wrist for better jab. - The wrist? - Yeah. Flick it out, snap it. Let me show you. So you get more speed and power. So try it. More wrist. It takes little practice. So, you're a boxer too. Well, not professionally. It's a little trick Marvin Hagler showed me. I am impressed. You know him? When I was working at his house installing a security system, I asked him to show me a few pointers. Luis said you wanted to see me. Yes. I must go to Mexico City to deliver a speech. For how long? I think at the most, it would be a couple of days. So I take it your wife and Luis will be traveling with you? No, no. They will remain here. In light of what has happened, I think it would be prudent even for you to move into the house. in orders to that my wife can have 24-hour protection. What about Luis? Luis must remain here. There's a lot of pressing business at the consul that he must attend to. Consequently, I'm going to have to impose upon you. - Hi. - Hi. Mr. Mejenes. - Your bags are packed by the door. - Thank you. Senor Griffith has agreed to keep you company while I'm away. Fine, Hector. Whatever you think is best. If you don't mind, there is a delicate matter that I need to discuss with my wife. - Absolutely. - And, Senor Griffith, - thank you for your help. - Anytime. Marilyn. How much do you need this time? In round figures, and I'm being conservative, no more than a million. Dollars? You heard the promise I made to Senor Talbot. I need to bring the business sector over to my side, in order for me to win the election. Couldn't you promise them appointments or something like that? Marylin, money instills confidence in the business sector, not appointments. In turn, that will instill confidence in the workers. Are you saying we're buying influence now? A wire transfer will be sufficient. It should not take more than five minutes of your time. No, Hector. I didn't agree to this. What are you saying? You want to throw our future away? I'm not sure it's the future I want anymore. Two whole days. Think you can handle it? How about the red one? I'm buying it. The house is all locked up, and I made sure that camera shut off in here. And Luis is working late. It's just us. First floor... secure. Yes, Luis, what is it? I'll be speaking with Senor Mejenes later today. Is there anything you wish to tell him? I hope his trip is going well. And if he should ask, what you've been doing with your time, what should I say? You can tell him I've been keeping myself occupied. Certainly. I'm sure he'll be glad to hear that. Will? He knows about us, doesn't he? He not only knows, he's got us on tape. Slimy son-of-a-bitch. We've gotta find the cassette. Where do you want me to start? Check the bathroom. Marilyn? Find it? Now what is this? I thought Detective Turner had all the tapes. I use two recorders. I always have a backup. All right. Just watch. - I don't see anything. - Just a minute. There! - What is it? - Right there. It's a homemade silencer. What are you telling me, Will? That there were no terrorists? It's been Luis all along. Come on. I'm getting you outta here right now. Will, I don't get it. Luis has been Hector's right-hand man for years. I'm gonna try and find Mejenes and warn him. What's the matter with you? Are you crazy? If Hector's en route, the only way to reach him is through the consulate. Hi. Please, can you tell me, what room Mr. Jesse Younger is in? Mr. Jesse Younger? Room A-136. - Straight down the hall and to your right. - Thank you. Compliments of Senor Mejenes. Oh, yeah? He asked me to tell you he hopes you're recovering well. Tell him I said thanks. Okay? One other thing. Your friend, Senor Griffith, has disappeared. Do you know where I might find him? You'd know that better than I would. Please, I haven't much time. Try his office. First place I looked. Now, can you please tell me, where does he live? I wish I could help you out, man, but I've never seen his place before. Again, where does he live? Yes? Blow it out your ass, Luis! Look. Please. Up your ass! You're never gonna get away with this. The address! Address. Go fuck yourself. I will tell Senor Griffith, you're a very good friend. He's finally getting some rest. Maybe you can come back later. Look! It's important that I speak to him right away! This is Mrs. Mejenes. Can you get the ambassador on the line? - Do you want me to try? - Hold on. 'Donde esta Senor Mejenes, por favor'? He's on the airport. 'Excusame, por favor. Necesito hablar con el Senor Mejenes. Es una emergencia'. Come on! - What is it? - Stay right here and don't move. I've been looking all over town for you. Couldn't you leave a note? Did you have to bust down the goddamn door? This was the way I saw it when I first arrived. I thought I'd hang around, because I figured there might be a connection. Well, I hate to be the one who has to tell you this, but your friend, Jesse, he's dead. Jesus Christ. - What happened? - We don't know. All we know is that he died from asphyxiation. The last person he was seen with was described was a hispanic male about six feet tall, with a beard. That's Luis. Luis Perez. I'm so sorry, Will. I just found out an hour ago, Luis was the one who staged the attack and shot Jesse. I've got the evidence downstars in my car. So he came here gunning for you. Yeah? Hello, sir. It's your husband. He's calling from the airplane. I've got some bad news, Mr. Mejenes. Luis Perez is the one who's been behind the terrorist attacks all along. Yes, I do have evidence. I'm turning it over to the police now. Yes, Sir. She's here. She's safe. Just a moment, sir. Mr. Mejenes, this is Detective Turner. I'm gonna keep them both under protective custody, but I want you to know, I'm putting out a APB on him. Perez, is that clear? All right, fine. If you need to reach me, you can call me at Homicide. Fine. He's gonna be landing in about 45 minutes. Come on, I gonna get you both out of here. Can you get word to the airport police? Luis just might be desperate enough to try and pop off Mejenes on his way through the airport. Come on, Will. I know my job. Listen, why don't you take Mrs. Mejenes and go on ahead. And let you run loose by yourself, Will? No Way! I don't care what you say to me. He killed my friend. I'm taking a shot at dropping this guy. Will! Will! Don't push it. I'm warning you. Get him inside! Hold the door! I can't! Will! No! I couldn't pull the trigger. It wouldn't shoot. It's okay. It's over. It's over. I have nothing but praise and admiration. For Senor Will Griffith. And with my sincere gratitude, I am honored to bestow upon you, the highest civilian award presented by my country, the Cross of Gallantry. Just a minute. I'm coming. I, too, would like to bestow upon you, a token of my own appreciation. Uh, sit down. Open this first. I can guess what this is. I don't know if I ever told you, but I really hate wearing ties. I know. But if an occasion pops up where you have to wear one, I hope you'll wear mine. It's a beautiful tie. Thank you. I'm gonna tell Hector I want a divorce. Then what? That's the hard part. I don't know. All my life I could have anything I wanted. I could even be first lady. All I have to do is buy it. So, what's that do for us? You tell me. Hector! You don't know how happy you've made me, to find the both of you like this. And just when I had thought everything else had failed, here you handed me the excuse that I need. Luis... You do remember Luis? You know what he used to say? He used to tell me, "If you want something to be done, you have to do it yourself." What's he talking about? Would you please explain, Mr. Griffith? Luis wasn't working alone. Hector's the one who wanted you dead all along. Very good. You son of a bitch! Sit down, Marilyn. This is my moment, to play the outraged husband. I want to enjoy it. Oh, my God. You really think you're gonna get away with this? An act of passion. No one in my country would deny me the right of defending my honor. And, Look how you have accommodated me. with all the proof that I need. It's still murder. You seem to forget, my dear, I have diplomatic immunity. And no one to keep you from inheriting all her money. And I rid myself of a political embarrassment. Jesus. Incredible. I admit. Yeah, what you just did, pal! Will!
