-[film projector clicking] -[soft music playing] [mid-tempo drum music] [woman] Ray! [distant men chattering] Ray! Linda! All right, here's the key. Don't try to catch it. [key clinks] It's stuck! Linda! [Linda] Hi. I can't the key to work. Oh, yeah, it's just temperamental. -Hey. -How you doing? -I'm fine. -[Linda] Shut the door. [Ray] All right, all right. Come on. [Ray] Give me that. -[Linda] Take that. -[Ray] All right. Welcome to hell. This is my Stairmaster. It's how I keep my youthful image. Oh, is that how you do it? Oh, God. What's that? [Ray] Don't touch. Just keep going. Just go. [Linda] Hurry up. Open the door. [Ray] Chill out. -[keys jangling] -[door creaks] Terry, honey? This is my sister, Linda. [Terry] Hola, Linda. Linda, this is my wife, Terry. -[Linda] Hi, Terry. -[phone ringing] I'm really happy to meet you. [phone ringing] Wow, Ray. She's really beautiful. Really? I hadn't noticed. [ringing continues] Oh, brother. Can I use the bathroom? [Ray] Sure. Right in there. [door rattles] [rattling continues] [door slams] [sighs] [distant siren wailing] [sighs] Oh, si. [speaking Spanish] All right. [inhales deeply] [coughing] Oh, oh... -[coughing] -Oh. Eh, eh, eh. -Don't do that. -Oh. -It expands. -[Linda whines] They don't make weak pot anymore. [coughs, sniffles] So, Ray, you're married. Are you in love, too? Oh, Lindy, give me a break. I did her a favor with immigration. Let's just look at her as another link in a long litany of girlfriends. [clears throat] She's not your girlfriend, Ray. She's your wife. [upbeat music plays] How old is she now? -Four. -Rain, I think. She looks exactly like you. She's beautiful. Oh, my God, is that a compliment? I'll take it. [child laughs] [music continues] Not a trace of Dick. There's a little Richard in there. Yeah, like a birth defect. That's my kid, Ray. All right, is it me, or has she been on the phone the entire time I've been here? -She's working. -She's working? El telefonico sexo. What the hell is that? Spanish phone sex. Ray, your wife does phone sex? America's number one cottage industry. In Spanish? You think only English-speaking people should have phone sex? Linda, you're a racist. I didn't know that about you. [Linda] That's not what I meant. Don't talk about this now. -Why not? -Because... She can't understand us. [girl laughs on TV] [Linda] So where is she from? [Ray] Colombia, Bogota. She got recruited to do phone sex. Supposed to be this big, glamorous gig in New York, and it didn't turn out that way at all. It was this, like, hellhole out in Brooklyn somewhere. Anyway, she had to get out of that place, so. Once we got together, you know, I called around, and I got her into a really reputable place -and I hooked her up. -[giggling] She can work from here. It's called working remote. [Linda] And now you're married to her. [Ray] Mm-hmm. -You got everything you need? -[yawning] Uh-huh. -You okay? -Yeah, I'm great. [sniffs] -Great. -[laughs] It's good to see you, Linda. It's good to see you, too. Thanks for having me. -Sure. Good night. -Good night. -Get the light. -Okay. Thanks. Mm. -[glass shatters] -[car alarm blares] [car alarm fades] [speaking Spanish] [moaning dramatically] [knocks] [woman sighs] Hey, Ray! [groovy music] Yo, bueno. We'll be right down. [speaking Spanish] [slams phone] Morning. -[Linda] Hey, Wayne. -Linda, baby doll! You're looking good, girl. [both speaking Spanish] -Let's get out of here. -Where are we going first? [Ray] You'll see. -Can we take a taxi? -[Ray] No. [Terry speaking Spanish] Shut the fuck up! How's Dick? He's fine. Actually, I don't see him very much. -Why not? -He travels all the time. -[Wayne] Business is that good? -[Linda] Yeah. Chrissy's good, though. I got a tape. You have to-- you have to see it. -Oh, yeah? -Yeah. She look like you? -Yeah. -That's good. Yes. -[both laugh] -That's very good. [all arguing in Spanish] [Linda] Okay, tell me about Terry. [Wayne] What about her? [laughing] Come on. What do you want to know? She's a nice girl. Well, I know she's a nice girl. I mean, I haven't spoken to her exactly. You know, it's kind of hard to do. -Right. [laughs] -She doesn't speak any English. [Wayne] She's a good kid. Ray loves her. I think it's great. [Linda] Does she love him? -[Wayne] I think so. -[scoffs] She's almost half his age. [Wayne] That's Ray's perfect woman. [sighs] That's dangerous. Get the fuck over there, back to work. -Oh, my God. -Get on the fucking telephone. [Linda] I don't like the phone sex thing. -[Wayne] It could be worse. -[Linda] I'm trying really hard to be cool about that, but I just, you know... It could be worse. And you, what's your fucking problem today? I'll give you a fucking problema. [Linda] You know what I think? I think he's gonna get hurt. [Wayne] She could get hurt, too. I don't think so. [Wayne] I feel the same way, but I let it go. It's Ray's life. -Say cheese. -Queso. [laughter] -Let it go. -I am. It's going right now. See it going? See it? Yeah. [music continues] [indistinct chatter] [upbeat jazz music plays] -So how's your acting career? -[spits] Oh! [laughter] Did I get any on you? -No. -Oh, a couple over there. Oh, it's fine. [speaking Spanish] [laughs] -Frio. -Si. -Thank you. -Actually, since I stopped acting, I haven't, uh-- I haven't had to go back on the, uh-- the stelazine-- [clears throat]-- for a while. On the what? It's a antipsychotic. It helps with the hallucinations. Are you okay? Yes. [laughs] [Terry speaking Spanish] The wind? -Biendo. -Viento. -Viendo. -Vien-to. Vien-to. Ah. So what are you doing now? I sell commercial time for a cable TV station. Oh, yeah. Do you like it? Yeah. Fascinating work, affords me a lavish lifestyle very much like this one here. Well, at least you're in the same business. You mean I'm still in show business? -[Linda] Yeah. -[both laugh] You're very sweet. Thank you for making a hideous failure seem like a partial success; thank you very much. [both chuckle] [music fades] You know, for years in our house, you couldn't mention Ray's name without saying, "Oh, God, what a shame." [laughs] -Really? -Yeah. "Oh, Ray." -You and your folks? -"He had-- He had so much potential." -[laughs] -"What happened?" [giggles] -Oh, hi, Ray. -Hi, Ray. -Shh, I'll tell you later. -[Linda laughs] -Ray the fuck-up. -[laughs] You are a handsome couple. [both laugh] I'm gonna leave you two alone. -[man] You dog, you. -[laughs] I'm gonna go join my bride in the boudoir. Thanks for the party. [water running] What do you think that is? Is that an ingrown hair? I don't know. Looks like a zit. Don't touch it. [laughter] -Okay, all right, okay. -Just leave it alone. -All right, I won't touch it. -It'll go away. Unless, of course, it's a huge boil! [laughs] Have you got any? -Boils? -On your butt? -[laughs] No. -[laughs] No, I don't have any boils on my butt. Sure. [water draining] Where are you from, some, like, rich, white neighborhood in Los Angeles? Brentwood, right? -[laughs] No... -That's right, isn't it? -Brentwood? -No, it's not Brentwood-- Right? It's not Brentwood? -No. -Well, what is it? -Pacific Palisades? -No. -Well? -Santa Monica. [laughs] -Santa Monica. -Yeah. [clears throat] What color are your, uh, panties? -Don't tell me. -[stammers] -Eh-- don't! -I'm not going to -- Guh! No, don't tell me. -I'm not going to. -Don't tell me. [laughs] I'm not going to tell you the color of my underwear. It's red. Red. -Maybe. -[laughs] Santa Monica. [laughter in distance] So, how's your girlfriend? Whoa. Wow. [clears throat] [floor creaking] -Um... -She's not here. Did you want some more couscous? -No. -You sure? -Yeah. -I think I'm gonna have some. How about Linda and Harlan? [laughs] Linda and Harlan. Whoo-hoo. [smooches] Linda's a married woman. [speaking Spanish] Back home. Eh, these things happen, you know? -That's life. -[both laugh] She's out of the country, by the way. Who is? I thought she'd be at the party. I haven't seen her. She didn't come. [laughs] Want to go for a walk? Go out and see the city before you go to bed? -I saw today. -Come on. It's like Never Never Land out there, Wendy. Come on, I'll show you the Lost Boys. -Oh, Peter. -Just for a-- yeah. I'm tired. You know, I'm just trying to make friends with you, you know? -I know. -I don't mean anything by it. -I know, I know. -You're okay. [chuckles] I know. You still don't wanna go? -No. -So have you given any thought to when you might be coming back? No, I haven't thought about it yet. Hmm. I think you should think about it. -[indistinct chatter] -[car horns honking] Hey, I knew I'd find you here. Considering I'm here about 19 hours a day, that's not exactly a brilliant deduction. So what's today's domestic horror show? -You don't want to know. -I do. -You don't. -I do. She's abandoned by her husband. She develops a drug problem. They take the kid away. Ugh, you're right. I don't want to know. -Yeah. -You know, Wayne, life's a whole hell of a lot easier if you kind of just slide out of its way. Where's Linda today? She's out with Terry, shopping. The sister-in-laws are attempting to bond. Really? Good luck. Ray, get out of here. -I've got a lot of work to do. -[stapler snapping] -Ray. -[chuckles] Ray, get out of here. [scissors snipping] Ray-- Ray, don't go there. -[laughing] -[clears throat] Ray! If you'd be willing to come in to my office and sit down with me, at that time, I'd be willing to divulge the name of my client and, uh, go over the practice specifically with you. [speaking Spanish] [Ray] Emphatically. We are very discreet. [Ray] Ask for me, John Stevens. Oh, no. Bye-bye. -[handset clacks] -[chuckles] Hey. Who are you talking to, Ray? Eh, just some asshole. [laughs] That's nice. [panting] You know, Terry is really wonderful. She's really very sweet. That's what you said about my last girlfriend. Terry's your wife, Ray. Remember? [moaning] This is my favorite. Look at the color. Look at the color. -It's great. -"It's great." You don't like it. Terry didn't like it either. Should I take it back? She's very smart, you know? [pants] So how do they pay her, anyway? Cash, like, under the table? No, she gets a check every two weeks. You know, they W-4, take off for taxes, the whole bit. You know, if she works for a year, she gets medical. -I hooked her up. -You're kidding me. She gets medical after a year? [laughs] Oh. This is better than that chick with the shaved head. -What's-her-name. -[Ray laughs] -Fallopian. -She earned that name. She was not right, Ray. [speaking Spanish] [moans] I'm trying to get her to take English lessons. Look, Ray, I don't want to seem out of line or anything, but, um... it ever occur to you that maybe she just married you to stay in the country? Of course that's why she married me. But that's not the only reason. Eh? Jeez, I don't know about that. Are you trying to get me to doubt my wife's intentions? -Not at all. -It always comes down -to this shit, doesn't it? -What shit, Ray? Ray can't handle his own fucking life. -You're not listening to me. -Let's judge him by our own pathetic bullshit bourgeois sensibility. You know, you haven't heard a goddamn thing I've said. Why don't you just pack your shit up? I think the car is gonna be here real soon. You're amazing, you know? You are such a hypocrite. There's worse things to be. Oh, really? Well, name one. You married him. I think you should apologize now. [piano music playing in distance] Tick, tick, tick. -[glass slams] -Tick. Linda, I'm sorry. I accept. -[glasses clink] -Chin, chin. That-- that's not it. -That's not it? -No. [music plays indistinctly] -He'll be here. -I don't see him. Oh, man. -I don't see him. -It stinks, doesn't it? Yeah. [distant indistinct chatter] I'm sorry. It's my fault. -I know. -[both laugh] -It was my fault. -It was your fault. I picked a fight. Well, I didn't help it. [brakes squeal] -Come back soon, really. -Okay. It was really fun having you here. -Will you tell Terry I said goodbye again? -Yeah, yeah. -[car horn honks] -Oh, here he is. -Is that him? -Here he comes. -Okay. -All right, give me my bag. -There you go. All right. -Bye. -All right. -I love you. [Ray] I love you. [keys jingling] [car door opens, shuts] -[indistinct chatter] -[car horns honking] Terry! Terry! [quietly] Fuck. [keys rattling] Fuck. Fuck. Terry! [Linda] That's my bag. I got it. Thanks. [upbeat drum music] [grunts] [music continues] [bong bubbling] [groans] [exhales deeply] -[Ray] Linda? -Ray? Hey. What? I thought you were gonna be at work. Well, I-- I wanted to be here when you got here. They tried to steal my stuff from downstairs. Oh, those assholes. Why didn't you yell out? Because I thought you were gonna be at work. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Just come on in. Look out. -How was your trip? -Oh, it was only okay. I'm sorry. -[music ends] -[speaking Spanish] -[laughs] -Okay. You okay? Yeah, I'm fine. -Fine. -Mm. It's good to have you back so soon. Thanks for letting me stay. I really needed to get away. Ach! You wanna go up? I bet they're done. -Yeah? -Just about, anyway. How long is it supposed to take? I don't know. It's the first one. [laughs] -* Ba-ti-bi-di-bi -* Guanabana -* Ba-ti-di-ti-di -* Guanabana * Ba-ti-bi-di [laughs] -[door creaks] -[keys jangle] -Hi. -[Ray] Hey, guys. I didn't expect you guys back so soon. -Hi. -Hi, Linda. -Marlene, how you doin'? -Yeah. Where you been? -Oh, shopping. -[Ray] To a bar. [Marlene laughs] Oh, yeah? -So, how's it going? -[Marlene] Oh, fine. It's going great. We've been learning lots of words, and, um... -[Ray] Mm-hmm. -[Marlene] You wanna see -what we've been doing? -[Ray] Sure. [Marlene] Okay. [speaking Spanish] Okay. Just one. We've been doing, like, "to send." -[Ray] Mm-hmm. -Oh, come on, you can do it. Hey, wh-- why don't we just, um-- why don't we just cool it for tonight? You know, I mean, it's-- it's so hot. You know what? Why don't we just, um-- you know, I mean, the point of the first one is just to get started, right? So... What? Okay. [door opens] -What'd she just say? -[Marlene] I'm sorry, Ray. I think I better go, Ray. -[door closes] -What'd she just say? -[sighs] -[Ray] Huh? I'm sorry. Look, I'm sorry. -I didn't mean for this to turn out like this. -It's okay. Look, I'm sorry, but he was supposed to give me $25. Oh, okay. -I'm sorry. -[Linda] Here you go. [Marlene] Okay, thanks. I'll see you around. -Okay, take it easy. -[Ray] Sorry, Marlene. [Marlene] I'm sorry, Ray. I didn't mean to-- -[Ray] That's okay. That's cool. -Okay. -Listen, if you need me... -All right. -I'm downstairs, okay? -Great. Say hi to your mom. -Sure. -Don't worry about it. -She'll be okay. -Okay. -[Marlene] Te veo. -Ciao. [door creaks, closes] [exhales sharply] It's hot. You want something to drink? -Yes. -Yeah. Adult-- adult beverage? -Adult. -Yes, okay. Us adults know how to drink. [upbeat drum music] Lindy... Ray? You gonna be okay? Mm-hmm. -Okay, I got to go to work. -All right. -Bye. -Bye. Thanks, Ray. Hi, this is Dee Hadley at VNR Legal Search. -How are you today? -Hello, caller. This is Don Kelly of VNR Legal Search. How are you today? Mr. Luka, how are you? Sam Patri of VNR Legal Search. How are you today? [moaning, speaking Spanish] [music continues] The reason I called is on behalf of my client, a major New York law firm that's looking for a corporate associate. A major New York law firm that's looking for a corporate associate. [moans] [indistinct chatter] Some international experience would be a plus, but not a necessity. Some international experience is a plus, but not a necessity, and we were just wondering if this is something you might consider as a possible option. We're wondering if this is something you might consider a possible option. [moaning, speaking Spanish] [music continues] All right, well, thanks for your time. Have a nice day. Bye. Well, I'm sorry to bother you. Bye-bye. Oh, fuck you! [music continues] You're smoking again in the morning, come on. -Yeah, please, please. -[woman laughs] If Ray can come in here at 10:30, we can smoke all morning. Now what does-- what does Ray have to do with your smoking? I don't quite understand it. Explain. We don't follow the rules, and he doesn't follow the rules! Yeah, but his rules aren't posted on the wall over there. -See that little sign? Ah. -I can't read that; it's in English. -Yeah, no hables Inglés? -No. [music continues] You quit the last time for what, seven years? Uh-huh. Seven years. So-- so what happened? I mean, you know-- -This way, I won't eat. -You won't eat? I gained 50 pounds when I went off the diet-- -when I went off cigarettes. -Oh, geez. 50 pounds. -So, you know... -What, over seven years? -Or all at once? -Seven years. Every year. [overlapping chatter] -Hey, Ray! -Oh, Ray! -How you doing? -Ray. Buenos tardes. Right on time, I see. Ray, you're late. Nothing happens till I get here, Neil. Are you doing something personal with this machine? Of course it's personal. Leave him alone. Let him get something out of this bullshit job. Look, if you want to do this, come back later. -I've gotta talk to Ray. -I'm sorry. I just, you know... Wait a minute. Reid, give me one of those. [Reid] Yeah. -Is this this place on Avenue A? -[Reid] Yeah. You know, Terry hasn't seen you guys yet. -I promise we'll come. -Yeah, I'll put you on the list. -[Ray] No, man, we'll pay. -Thanks. [music continues] Ray, there's been a change. -Neil... -He's coming today at 11:00. -That's now! -You've done these before. Ray. Ray! [speaking Italian] [music continues] Where's my fucking tie? Here, wear mine. I hate this. I'm a phone guy. Now, when I do one of these, what I do is I prepare a list. Oh, screw you, Neil. The prick wouldn't even take your call. -[groans] -Oh, don't get pouty on me now. Do you know what the fee is on this? How long have I been doing this? -Who trained you? -Fuck you. I got this wimp in my hip pocket. [speaking Italian] Trinitrons, baby. They're beautiful. How many lawyers at Smith and Dawson? -Fuck you. -How many? -120. -Partner-associate ratio? -45/75. -Who is the managing partner? [scoffs] Neil, why don't you just jerk off in there? You're all set up for it. Eat shit, Ray. Yeah, you got some? Okay. How does this go? The bear goes around the mountain, comes back through the rabbit hole, and comes up through, and comes on down there... and he slides out the noose. Ray, you're pathetic. No, Neil, I'm pretty. [clears throat] What could have been... Let's go to war. [speaking Italian] Trinitrons, baby. They're beautiful. Mr. Payne, John Stevens. Pleasure to meet you, Stevens. So, um, did you have any trouble finding the place? Before we get started, there's just a few things that I need to have established right up front. [speaking Italian] Trinitrons, baby. They're beautiful. [speaking Italian] Each! Fucking scumbag. Despite the fact that I have had in the past some egregiously awful experiences with headhunters, I nevertheless agreed to meet and listen to-- I repeat, listen to what you have to say. But you are under no circumstances authorized to talk to anyone about me or my practice without my knowledge or consent. [music continues] [car horn honks] I have a very exceptional arrangement at my firm. All of my business is mine-- exclusively mine. I get to eat what I kill. -Of course. -No, not of course. Mine is a unique situation. There are maybe four or five partners in all of New York that have the agreement with their partners that I have. Understood. But, um, if you'll allow me to stick with your carnivorous metaphor for a moment, Mr. Payne, how would you like to sink your teeth into Smith and Dawson? [music continues] Well, I have to be candid; I really didn't expect your client to be at this level. [laughs] [all speaking foreign languages] -No. -No? No. I believe I could, uh, set up a meeting with the hiring partner, but, um, only with your knowledge and consent, Mr. Payne. You have both, Mr. Stevens. Well, that being the case, let's give them a call. [music continues] [Terry] Mmm. [smooches] Eric! John Stevens. Yes, I met you on the Caven deal. How was Sri Lanka? Ugh. Well, I hope you didn't lose too much weight. [music continues] [smooching] Luisito. Yes, I believe we could set something up for next week, say, um, Wednesday, um-- Eric. Not Wednesday. How about Thursday? Say, uh, 1:00? Excellent. 1:00, it is. Right. I'll be in touch. Goodbye. -[phone clacks] -Voilà. [Terry sighs] [Terry] Hmm. [laughing] Yeah. Ray, put your dick back in your pants. All you did was get the guy an interview. Neil, this guy is gonna save our summer. He's a walking fee. You know how much money you could make if you just put a little effort into it? You sound like a broken record. You know, this is getting to be a real pain in the ass. [Ray] Beats paying taxes. They're gonna catch you someday. Eh, they're afraid to come to my neighborhood. How much is in there? Between you and me, Neil? Somewhere between 11 and 15 grand. [laughs] You're out of your fucking mind. You don't know the half of it. [lighter strikes] [speaking indistinctly] [music continues] [moans] Whew. That's it for me. [laughs] All right, don't you guys work too hard, all right? -Bye, Dani. -Bye, Ray. [car horns honking] [speaking Spanish] [scoffs] [Luis] Hm? [music continues] [car horn honks] [Terry sighs] Joey, where are you-- Joey! Hi, you wanna play catch with me? Yeah, okay, I'll try. Joey, leave the man alone, honey. Oh, that's okay. -Are you sure? -Well, I don't know. -I mean, you don't have to. -I wrecked my shoulder doing carpentry a long time ago, but I'll give it a shot. [mother] Oh, you should-- -Ma'am, I love baseball. -You shouldn't be doing this, then. Oop. [Luis coughing] [Terry laughs] Go to hell. [laughs] [Luis] "Go to hell." Come on, throw it to Mommy. -Here you go, Mommy. -Oh, yeah. [laughs] He misses his dad. -Do you have kids? -No. My street does. They like to break windows. -Oh! -Whoops. Oh. Having fun, huh? -This nice man. -[Ray] Here you go. You know, I've seen you here before, but I just-- I don't know your name. I'm Tracy. -Ray. -Pleased to meet you, Ray. -It's good to meet you. -Yeah. -[Ray] Ope. -Oh, that's okay, sweetheart. [children shouting in distance] [music continues] [sighs] You wanna come sit on the, um, blanket? -It's more comfortable. -[Ray] Sure. So w-- what do you do? Are you a writer? -[laughs] -Or something? I don't know. What makes you think that? -Here, you want one? -No, thanks. I don't know; I just see you here all the time. You know, you're observing people and... [laughs] No, nothing so glamorous. Would you like an apple or some... -No? -[Ray] No, thanks. So what do you do? -I'm a headhunter. -Like a job salesman? I'm an executive recruiter specializing in liars-- lawyers. [laughs] I know what you mean. My ex-husband was a lawyer. What firm does he work at? Maybe I could, uh... [laughs] get a fee. Where do you live? Oh, way downtown. The Lower East Side. Like, really east and really down. [laughs] I-- I just never-- I never pictured you doing something like-- like being a headhunter. Neither did I. [Terry speaking Spanish] You really-- it was really nice of you to play with him. Oh, he's a great kid. He's really great. -Yeah. -Look, Tracy, I gotta go. I'm-- I'm having a party tonight. Hey, you wanna come to my party? -Huh? You wanna? -Wow, I-- I can't. No, I have to work. I gotta work. I work nights. Call in sick. Everybody else does. Oh, God, I can't. I have to take care of him, you know? I need to save my sick days for him. He's getting sick. He's got the measles and, you know, everything now. I mean, I'd love to, really. -You know, maybe some other time. -Yeah, yeah. Well, it was great meeting you. Oh, it was lovely meeting you. -All right. See you around. -You want an apple? -No, no thanks. I gotta go. -Are you sure? -You could eat it on the train or something. -No, I... Oh. I gotta-- I gotta get my paper. -I gotta have something to read on the subway. -Oh, yeah. Otherwise, I'd have to look at all those people. [laughs] -Okay, bye. -Okay, bye. [music continues] [music fades] [lively music playing] [indistinct chatter] "What's that nigger doing in my room?" He says, "Mother, Mother, please, this is my lawyer." [indistinct chatter continues] Hi. [laughs] [Harlan] You want something? Can I get you something to drink? -I got something. -Eggs? -No. -Magnesium? No. [panting] How you doing? Hot. -Pretty good. -Mm-hmm. You all right? Yeah, I'm fine. You look very nice. Thank you. [indistinct chatter continues] Hey, Ray, how's it going? Is your girlfriend back from Europe yet? [items clattering] [can clatters] You know, I know you probably don't mean anything by it, but, um... [clears throat] I'm really uncomfortable talking about this with you at all. Okay? Yeah, okay. -Thanks. -Sure. -[breathing heavily] -[man] Hey, Ray. -Hey, man. -Look what I got for you. Hydroponic. [stammering] Look, is-- is Terry-- is Terry here yet? You okay? Yeah, man, yeah. Go get Wayne, will you? -Just go get Wayne. -Yeah, sure, sure. [Ray] Okay. [panting continues] So, uh, let me try. How's your husband? I think he's having an affair. -Really? -Mm-hmm. You seem pretty calm about it. No, I'm not calm. I just cover it well. Wayne, man, something's wrong with Ray. Excuse me. And you came back to New York because... um... -Family. -Family. -Mm-hmm. -You needed to be with family, and New York is a nurturing and comforting environment for someone who's going through emotional and psychic upheaval. [laughs] That's right; it's a great distraction. Hey, man, I'm having one of those attacks, man. -When did this start? -About a half an hour ago. Did you take a Dramamine? Yeah, man, it didn't work this time. -Hola. -H-- hi, Terry. [speaking Spanish] Fuck the doctor, man. Wayne. Wayne. Wayne, get everybody out of the bathroom. Get everybody out of the bathroom. Excuse me. [knocking on door] Would you hurry up in there? We got a problem out here. -[Terry shouting in Spanish] -Give-- give me some air, baby. Wayne! [pounding on door] -[Ray] Wayne! -Come on. -[Ray] Wayne, now! -Stop fucking around. We need the bathroom now! -[retching] -[woman] Aw, Jesus! [vomiting] Oh, my God! [vomiting continues] -Ray. -[vomiting continues] What are you guys doing? Never seen somebody puke before? -[vomiting continues] -[indistinct conversations] Come on, give him some air. Give him some air, you guys. -It's all right, man. -[Linda] Yeah, enough already. [Ray] Baby. Vamanos, baby. -Let's just spread out. -Come on. Hey. -Easy. -You're pushing me. -Stop it. -Easy. -Vamanos, baby. -No, baby, por favor. Vamanos. [indistinct chatter] Yeah. Good one. -Here. Come on. -[Ray groaning] All right, it's all over, okay? The bad part's over. Shh, shh, hey. Shh, it's me. -[Ray] Oh, fuck. -[Harlan] The bad part's over. Okay, Ray? -Rise off the toilet. -Okay. [Harlan] You didn't do anything wrong, okay? Just stand up for me. It's all right. Hold-- stay right there. Right there, right there. Here we go. -It's all over. -[Ray panting] [Harlan] Go to bed now, huh? Come on. Come on. It's all right. Get into bed. Atta boy. There you go. All right. Atta boy. [claps] He's gonna be all right now. [Ray mumbling] I'm so glad you're here now, babe. [groaning] [Ray mumbling] I'm so glad you're here. [moaning softly] Oh, baby... I'm so glad you're here. You never seen this before? -It's colorful. -[Wayne] Yeah. -Let's go, you guys, come on. -[Wayne] He'll be okay in a couple of hours. [Ray murmuring indistinctly] [door opens, closes] [Harlan] What are you doing out here? -[Linda] Nothing. -[Harlan] Hmm? Don't take it personal that he wouldn't let you help him. He doesn't feel safe unless he's puked on you about a half a dozen times. Well, I'm glad you took care of him. [laughs] [sniffles] -Go get something to eat? -Mm-mm. No. -You sure? -Yeah, I don't wanna leave him. Okay. -I'll see you at the beach tomorrow. -Okay. -Wear a bathing suit. -Good idea. [speaking Spanish] [Terry sighs] [glass clanks] [mid-tempo drum music] [Terry sighs] -How you feeling today, Ray? -It's so hot. Ray, you don't feel bad because you fucked up the party, do you? [laughs] Now, now. In a way, I feel closer to you now that I've helped clean up your puke. -Oh! -[laughter] [laughs] Cherry! [whistles blowing in distance] -[Linda] You do. -[Ray] I don't wanna go in the water. -[Harlan] Are you sure? -[Ray] I'm okay. You wanna go on the Cyclone first? -[laughs] No. -Oh, shh. [Harlan] Have some pancakes and go on the Cyclone? I was on the Cyclone last night. [light jazz music] Oh, I wish I felt better. Such a nice day. [Terry speaking Spanish] [Ray] Every hour or so, I feel a little better. -You feel dizzy? -No. No, I feel okay. I feel better with you rubbing me with that stuff. -Oh, that's good. -Is that good? -Yes, more of that. -That's okay? Yes, that's great. You know what this means, though, don't you? Okay, you can stop. [laughter] -Did you tell me you're 28? -Yeah, I just turned 28. [indistinct shouting in distance] -You're so boy-ish. -[laughs] I like boy-ish. You do? How old are you? 40. 40? I like 40. You wanna get in the water? -I'm not going in there. -[laughing] "I'm not going in there." I'm not going in that water. "I'm not going in there." Why not? 'Cause, it's full of sh-- of shit. What? [distant music continues] [sighs] -I'm not going in. -I'm going in. -Okay, bye. -[shouting in Spanish] Come on, get out there. Don't be afraid. It's all right. -Oh, this is gross. -Doesn't that feel good? -This is gross! -Hey, come on, it feels good. -Aww, I don't like this. -It's like the Caribbean. No, it's not like the Caribbean. -It's warm. -I know the Caribbean, okay? -Warm. -Ugh! So, how you feeling? -Better. -You look much better. Thanks, man. Isn't she beautiful? -I think, um... -[woman] Hold up, I think I got it! As long as you don't have any, uh, open sores or exposed mucous membranes, you're gonna be okay. It's getting scary, man. Yeah, it was pretty violent last night. Yeah, you gotta figure something out. Oh, man. Don't wreck today. -Ooh! -Where? -Uh! -What? Harlan, Harlan, just take me in. Where? Into the shore! Oh, oh, there, okay. All right. Let's go. Look, it's soy sauce. -You want some? -No! Okay. -It's a fucking picnic. -Huh? Nothing. [indistinct shouting in distance] -[Harlan laughs] -Don't touch it! [child screaming in distance] Oh, no! You-- [laughs] [screeching] [laughing] [bong bubbling] [laughing continues] [chuckles] Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Girl... [laughs] Damn. Ay! [laughs] [Chrissy babbling] Mmm. Hmm. [Terry sighs] [babbling continues] You're in my bed. Are you staying here? Mm-hmm. Nice. Are you staying there? I thought I might. You weren't gonna ask me about it? [sighs] Take your clothes off. I mean, um-- [clears throat] Can I stay here with you tonight? What about your girlfriend? [laughs] Oh, oh, I see how this has to work. Hmm. [sighs] [sighs] Okay. Well, uh, the thing with us is that we, um... we, uh... We don't have sex. We, uh-- we don't like to have sex with each other. You know, we're very, very, uh-- we're very close to each other. We're very much each other's family. We-- we don't seem to be able to leave each other, but we, um... we don't want to have sex with each other. We do, of course, from time to time, have sex, just not with each other, and so, um, in order to avoid any, uh, emotional difficulties in our relationship, we just don't tell each other about it. You know, I mean, just because I'm fucking someone else doesn't, you know, mean it doesn't hurt if she's fucking someone else, even if I don't want to fuck her. You know what I mean? [mid-tempo drum music] How was that? That was good. That mean I can stay? Ray. Ray. [door creaks] [music continues] [keys clatter] [music fades] [Harlan] Want something to drink? -No, thanks. -You sure? -That's not bad. -Thank you. I see you don't share Ray's fear of comfort. Well, Ray's a little extreme. -He doesn't actually have to have a point to make a point. -That's true. Now. Now. Okay, you can take those off. How many of these episodes have you had now? Um, altogether, like, uh, nine or ten. The last guy I saw said I had Meniere's Syndrome. Well, that's a possible diagnosis, but, uh, what you're experiencing are symptoms of vertigo. Now this can be caused by a brain tumor-- -Brain tumor? -High or low blood pressure, allergies, psychological disturbance, stress, anemia, excess wax in the ears, infection, or even your diet. Earwax? We really won't know anything till we do some more tests. I've had a lot of tests. They're really expensive. Don't worry. Insurance covers it. I don't have insurance. Ray, you really have to have insurance. Okay, thanks, Doc. All right, look, um... give me a call if it gets worse. Okay. I've got... a little something for us. I don't want to do any coke. My husband does it, and it makes him crazy. I don't-- I don't want to do any. I'm sorry. It's not coke. [Linda] What is it? It's dope. Well, dope is pot where I come from. Well, dope is dope in New York City. I'm not putting anything in my body unless I know what it is. It's heroin. [sniffs] Isn't that addictive? [laughs] No way. I do it all the time. [laughter] I'm serious. Don't laugh. [sighs] Yeah, of course it's addictive. It's heroin. What do you-- what do you-- [laughing] What? Think you're playing with kids here? You don't have to have any. I'll just... do a little more, if that's okay. [sniffs] [woman] Mr. Thomas, can I see your benefit card, please? Benefit card? [woman] Your insurance information. I don't have insurance. The system has failed me. -That'll be $150, please. -[scoffs] Oh, uh, we take American Express, Visa, MasterCard, Discover, or personal checks. I don't have any of those. -I beg your pardon. -I don't have a credit card. -Well, then I'll take a check. -I don't have checks. Are you a visitor from another planet? -Look, you don't take cash? -We're not set up for it. The doctor couldn't cure me. Why don't we just call it even? Very funny. You know why they won't let you take cash, don't you? The doctor's afraid you're gonna steal it. Mr. Thomas, I'm afraid you're gonna have to go to the post office and get a money order. I can't do that. I got a thing about lines. Look, lady, I gave you a fake name, a fake address. You don't know who I am or where I live. So why don't you just keep this money for yourself? I'm sure the doctor's got plenty of it. Mr.-- [sighs] I can't. Look, why don't you take all of this money and buy yourself something real nice like some thigh-high stockings and a leather mini skirt? You can pick yourself up a vibrator while you're at it. -[scoffs] -[door opens] [door closes] You'll probably like it. -Yeah? -Mm-hmm. Just like a-- a warm bath on a cold day. Am I gonna get sick? Yeah, you might get nauseated a little bit the first time. You ready? Just a little tiny bit. Look, just that much. It's your first time. Go, go. -[sniffs] -Good. Very good. You all right? -Mm-hmm. -Okay. Just a little bit on the other side, okay? [coughing] [sniffs] Ready? Go. -[sniffs] -Good. You all right? [coughing] [sniffs] -You okay? -Mm-hmm. Now what do we do? We smoke. I think there's, like, a synergistic relationship between heroin and nicotine-- the combination. I really like it. Like Ray said, it's in the combos. Does Ray do this? [snorts] No. By the way, you know, he probably wouldn't approve of this. If he knew that you and I were sitting over here at my house, doing heroin, he might have some feelings about it, so we should probably just... just keep it to ourselves. -[sniffs] Really? -Oh, yeah, absolutely. He'll become very parental about it for the both of us, I think. Well, we can't have that. So we'll just-- we'll just keep it between you and me. Okay. You want some more? Mmm... Are you gonna do any? Mm-hmm. This is me with Joey when we had a house in the summer. That's my dad. Isn't he handsome? And there he is with the fish he caught. And that's my mom with me. She looks like you. -You think so? -Yeah, definitely. Ready, aim, fire! Call me sometime, huh? Yeah? I gotta go, okay? Joey, come on. -Goodbye! -[Ray] Bye, Joey. [Stacy] Joey! Ugh! I am not running after you! [swallowing] Are you hungry? Mm-mm. [coughing] I feel a little funny. You wanna throw up? You might feel better if you throw up. [Linda] Mm-mm. [alarm beeping] What time is it? [sighs] 9:15. -Mm. -I have to go to work. Mm-mm. -Nope! -I have to go. No. -Darling. -No. -Darling. -No, call in sick. -Get off me. -Everybody else calls in sick. I have to go. No. [laughs] Ugh! [gasps] You don't love me anymore. [bell jingling] I didn't tell you that I loved you, did I? -Yeah. -Fuck! [laughs] Are you sorry? Fuck! [laughs] Don't forget, we have dinner with Ray and Terry tonight. -What? -We have dinner with Ray and Terry tonight. -Yeah, with Ray and Terry? -Yes. Hmm, hmm. -Hmm! -[laughs] Mwah! -If you gave me a hickey, I'm gonna hurt you. -Hurt me. -Kevin Martin. -Is Amy in? -Is Kevin in? -It's a personal matter. -It's a new matter. -Yes, I'm holding for Luis Gunther. Kevin, this is John Stevens, legal recruiter. No, no message. Thank you. I, uh, don't feel you need to have your secretary know that you're taking calls from legal recruiters. Yes, they're paying major law firm rates. We are a necessary evil in this equation. All right. Okay. I'm going to, um-- I'm gonna say goodbye now. I can terminate this phone call right now -and never bother you again. -Bitch. Or I could take a minute and describe this opportunity, and you could decide whether, um, it was beneficial to you. -Yes, I am married. -Excellent. -Terrific. -No, you have a nice day. -Goodbye. -Now they're looking for someone with a million dollars in business, or, uh, increments of that if it's a group. -[sighs] -Fine. Can you give me an idea of when she'll be returning? Is Thursday or Friday good for you next week? -Nope, no message. -At the lunch hours? -Of course, I understand. -Come on. -Excellent. -Very good. -We'll see you then. -Great. -Great. -Thank you. -Thank you. -Thank you. Bye-bye. [indistinct chatter in distance] [light trumpet music playing] -Hey, man, where you going? -Home. -Whoa. -Give me your money, man. Fuck, all right, all right. I'm just going to put my hand in my pocket and get my wallet out. Just take it easy. There, man. Man, you fucking follow me, I'll fucking kill you, man. Hey, can I have my wallet back? -Ugh! Ah! -Fucker. -Ay dios mio! -Hey, baby. -¿Que paso? -What the fuck happened? -I got mugged. -[Wayne] Where? [speaking Spanish] -[Ray] Down the block. -[Wayne] By who? -Aw, fuck, that hurts. -By who? -Oh, oh, some homeboy. -Where did this happen? -Down the block. -Down the block where? Uh, Houston and Ridge, Houston and Ridge. Right around the corner on Ridge. What do these guys look like? -One guy. -One guy. -What does he look like? -Thank you. What's he wearing? -A big gun. -Cuidado, cuidado. -Were there any cops around? -No cops. Did you call the cops? Did you say we need police? -[groans] Ow, ow, ow! -Did you call the police? [speaking Spanish] -This needs to be investigated. -I don't wanna talk to the fucking police! -Ray. -What are the police gonna do? They're gonna eat like they always do. Ray, we've gotta report this. I just wanna lie down. [speaking Spanish] -Try to think about the guy. -I just wanna lie down. -Ray, please... -You don't know what he looks like? Oh, fuck, he looks like a homeboy. -I don't know. Who cares? -What kind of-- -Black, Puerto Rican-- -Jesus Christ. -Let me lie... -Ray. [singing in Spanish] [hums] [continues singing in Spanish] Hmm. -[Linda] Hey. -Hmm. How you feeling? -Great. -[laughs] How's your lip? Fat. Don't pick it. -Mom. -Uh-huh. Listen, I'm gonna go downstairs 'cause my car is gonna be here in, like, ten minutes. It's good to see you again. It's great seeing you, too, Ray. Come back soon, but don't bring your husband. He's not invited. My husband? Your husband? Remember? Oh, my God. I'm married. -Ahh, me too. -[laughs] Oh, no. Take it off. [Ray groaning] How did that happen? I don't know. -Don't look at me like that. -[chuckles] -I'm out of here. -Okay. -Not the lip, okay? -Yeah. [smooch] -I'll call you. -Okay. -Get some sleep. -Okay. [car horns honk in distance] [all shouting in Spanish] And that's where you're gonna go. You son of a bitch! Hmm? Son of a "beetch"? [mid-tempo drum music] [phone ringing] Stevens. Hey, Dick. [distant arguing in Spanish] Fucking... -[woman] You love it. -"You love it." I know what you fucking love. I had this, though. She's not in New York. She was just here. If she was in town, she would have called me. [laughs mockingly] [laughs mockingly] Don't worry. I'm sure everything's fine. Luis? [music continues] [speaking Spanish] Just take it easy. Don't go ballistic. All right, I'll speak to you. Take care. Bye. [sighs] Harlan, pick up. Okay, I guess you're not home. Look, Linda's husband just called me, and he said she's missing. [speaking Spanish] [music continues] Hmm. [sighs] Luis? Ay. [Ramona] Luisito? -Luis? -[overlapping Spanish chatter] [Terry sobbing] Huh? [murmurs in Spanish] They were naked. [sniffs] In the kitchen. He had her up on the table. Right where Chrissy eats her breakfast. Well, where were you? Outside, looking in a window? I was in that house. I was quiet. They didn't hear me. They were, you know... [sniffles] They were occupied. Lindy, why don't we just give this a little rest? [cars passing outside] [sniffs] [sniffles] So what happened then? I watched him. She was very young, Ray. [door opens, closes] Guess who I saw on the way... home. [sighs] -[sniffs] -Hello, Raymond. Hey, Harlan. [clears throat] Everybody having a good time? -Mm-hmm. -[Harlan] Mm-hmm? Mm-hmm. [sighs] [music playing softly in distance] [sniffs] [Linda hums, sniffs] So what happened then? [sniffs] He saw me, you know? Mm-hmm. He looked right at me. He looked right at me, and he kept on fucking her. -That's what he did. -Well. [sniffs] [Harlan] Let me put that... It's all right, sweetie. It's okay. You're doing okay. [crying] Oh, my God. [phone ringing] Stevens. What, did you retire over there? -[background chatter] -[phones clacks] Ray, you look like a homeless person dressed like that. Not today, Neil, all right? Okay. You want to talk about it? What's wrong? Don't worry about it. [sighs] Damn. I forgot how to do this. Oh, man. -What's the matter? -There's a big ol' bubble in there. Damn! All right, there it goes. So whether do you do this or not is completely up to you. It's okay with me either way. But if you're expecting me to talk you into it, I'm not going to. Can't be responsible for whether or not you put a needle in your arm, okay? The decision has to be yours. -Okay? -Mm-hmm. Okay. See that? [breathing deeply] [car horn honks in distance] [exhales deeply] I can't do it. I can't do it. I'm gonna go. Leave me those cigarettes. Mm. You leave me those cigarettes? Thank you, baby. [pack drops] [door opens] [door slams] [sighs] [neutral droning] [melancholy funk music] When did you get back into this shit, Harlan? [Harlan] Not very long ago. Couple months. I mean, you worked so hard. We all did. I know. I really hate disappointing everybody. Oh, no, it's not that, man. It's you. You can't backslide like this. -We went through all that shit, man. -I know. I mean, bail and the law and the re-- all that crap. You're right. I know you're right. What can I do? -What can I do? -Harlan, that's my kid sister. She's a grown woman, I think, about 30-something years old. Yeah, you are one hell of a friend. You're always right there for me. I'm probably not-- I'm not having a very good time. So, you know... If you need anything, man, I'm there for you. -I know. -All the way, man. Take care of yourself, Harlan. Don't go back there. Okay. -[mid-tempo drum music] -Ma, I'm coming home. I'm going to get Chrissy. Everything is fine. Everything is fine. Mr. Siegfried, hi. Harlan Edwards. How are you? Yes, I'm coming home. I'm gonna take Chrissy. I've left her with you that long before. I don't want to talk to her right now, Ma, please. Very, very sorry about lunch yesterday. Very sorry. Couldn't be helped. I know it's confusing for her. I'm trying to do what's the best for everybody. Well, I was thinking, if you-- if you were willing, that we might be able to actually have lunch, uh, tomorrow. -I'm at a friend of Ray's. -Wonderful. -No, it's not a man-- Mom. -That would be just great. I don't want the number of a marriage therapist, Ma. And, uh, please, please say hello to... Margot for me, okay? Ma, why are you crying? All right, Hans. All right, Hans, I'll see you for lunch tomorrow. All right, well, you give her a big-- no, I don't want to say hello. I'll-- I'll do it when I get home, Mom. Good-bye. [sighs] [laughs] -Ooh. -I love you, too. And thanks for taking care of Chrissy. Okay, bye. [music ends] [Terry speaking Spanish] [sighs] [water stops running] [phone beeps, whirs] [phone clacks] [keys jangle] [Ray] Hey, baby. ¿Que pasa? Eh, I didn't feel like going to work. How was your day? Oof, busy. Busy. Hmm. Who was on the phone when I just came in now? -¿Como? -Uh, el teléfono when I came in. El teléfono when I entrade just now-- just now? Who was on the phone just now, baby? Un amiga. Hmm? Un amiga. Um... A girl friend. Yeah. Well, I'm gonna go visit Wayne. Adios. [door opens] [door closes] -[sighs] -[water splashing] [mid-tempo drum music] What are they saying? She's not real happy with this guy. He sounds kind of flaky. Is she fucking him? My guess is it's not a regular thing. You mean the only fuck once in a while? -I didn't say that. -Oh, you said plenty. -Here, give me that. -Ray, I didn't say that. Thanks for the translation, Wayne. Ray, wait. Ray. I got a bad feeling about this, Lindy. Ray, you can make her do what you want, but I'm telling you, it's gonna come back to you sometime. I am fucked. Ray, it's gonna be okay. I am totally fucked. [both speaking Spanish] Fuck you. Hey, Ray, I think I'm gonna go home tomorrow. Already? Yeah, it's time for me to go. You're not going back to Dick, are you? No. Kind of puts my little problem into perspective. Oh, yeah? What? What's been happening to you. What's been happening to me, Ray, has been happening to me for a long time. Teresa. [speaking Spanish] Teresa. [music continues] [music fades] What's wrong? -Nothing. -I can tell when I'm being ignored. I'm not ignoring you. [both sigh] -I'm distracted. You know I'm leaving tomorrow. -Well, thank you. I really appreciate you putting out the effort. It made me feel much less rejected. -I'm sorry. -Mm-hmm. I do have to go get Chrissy, you know? I know. [sighs] You can come back. -Bring her with you. -Yeah? You can always stay here with me. -[car horns honking] -[children shouting outside] I know about Luis. Luis? "Luis?" [floorboards creaking] Look. If you got to be with this guy... it's cool. But you're gonna have to go. I think you comprendo. I'll make it as simple as I can, okay? [Terry sniffles] Luis or me? I'm sorry. Come on. Luis or me? [crying] [whispering] I love you. [kiss] It's okay, baby. It's okay. It's okay. Don't leave me. Please don't go. [chuckles] I have to, Harlan. I have a child at home. I've enjoyed getting to know you. Hmm. I've enjoyed you getting to know me, too. [mid-tempo drum music] [indistinct chatter] Terry? Terry? [music continues] -Excuse me, do you have time? -Yeah, it's, uh, 4:00. 4:00? Are you sure it's working well, this watch? [chuckles] Of course it is. Oh, come on. I can't believe that. Where is this accent from? Are you from Spain? -Yeah. -Oh. [speaking Spanish] We're gonna go downstairs and wait, I think. -[clears throat] Wanna? -Yeah. Okay, let's go. Don't be too long; the cab will be here soon. Okay, I'll be there in a minute. [door opens] Ray, you know, if you wanted, I could stay a couple of extra days. I don't have to go home right away. Maybe I should. Nah, go home. They're worried about you. I hate to leave you like this. Lindy, it's been great hanging out with you again. [Harlan] Linda! The taxi's here! -Oh, God. -Prick. [both laugh] Come on. [pats leg] Let's go. Okay. [mid-tempo drum music] Hi, Ray O'Brien, please. -Stevens. -Ray-Ray. Hey, Wayne-o. -How you doing? -Good, man. How are you? -I'm okay. -Really? I'm okay, man. You know, for what it's worth, you guys had a good thing going. That's the way it goes sometimes, you know? Hey, how you doing, man? [laughs] You all right? Yeah. I mean, I know you're on the bum kick over there. I just called to check in, make sure everything's okay. Yeah, appreciate that, man. Well, you know what I was thinking? I was thinking, why don't you, um, do something nice for yourself today? Why don't you, like, leave work early and, uh, I don't know, go to the park or something. Do something. Go for a walk. It's, like, the most beautiful day of the decade outside. It's gorgeous. Yeah, it just cooled off. Look, okay, you bum out if you want to, okay? You do whatever you want. I just thought it might be nice... [music continues] [music continues] [music fades] [music re-enters]
