That son of a bitch, I'm fuckin' done with this. - Get back in there. - I'm not goin', fuck that. That fucking prick, I'm tired of his shit. - Come on. - I'm not going, I'm gonna rip his fuckin' face off. - I'm gone two minutes, you get my partner all riled up. How do you do that? Who said you could smoke in here? - Your partner outside did. - Yeah. - Hell of a guy. - Yeah he's a great guy, but now it's just us, we're gonna start fresh. Clean slate. State your name. - Kook Packard. - Full name. - Kook Packard. - One more time. - Kookie. - Packard, Kookie Packard. - How 'bout you, Daniels, you got a first name? - That's not important. You mind puttin' that smoke out? - Smoke bother you? You know what bothers me, Daniels? Being detained on suspicion without being charged. I mean, it's obvious that you guys got nothing despite my good humor for God knows how long. I mean, I can't even enjoy a fucking cigarette or get a cup of coffee. - Oh, I'm sorry, you want a cup of coffee? - I would love one, cream and sugar. - No cream. No sugar. - Forget it. - What's your relationship with Miss Lang? - None. - Well, witnesses seem to put you there the night of the murder. They also put you there at the Lone Cafe. Witnesses also say they see you leave late that night in a late-model Buick. - Riviera. It's a spectacular automobile. It's classic all-around. - 1965, reminiscent of that Skylark. So, what is your relationship with Miss Lang? - Well I'd be lying to you if I told you there was one. I introduce myself at the restaurant, bump into her again outside, we hit it off. Went up for a cruise on Mulholland. And then I dropped her off. Where'd you drop her off at? - A coffee shop on Franklin, said she was meeting a friend. - After that? - Then after that I grabbed a milkshake at Mel's Drive-In over on Highland, and then I drove home, and slapped in the Three Stooges marathon. You know, you kind of remind me of one of the stooges. - Is that so? - You want to know which one? - No, I don't. - Schtoopee. - Schtoopee, I never heard a Schtoopee. - No, well he was brilliant. - Yeah? - Yeah, came and went. You want to know what the real joke is, Daniels? - What's that Kookie? - Is that I'm still here talking in circles. - You know what else is great, Kookie? Is that I love circles. And to be frank, I love my job. - That makes two of us. - I don't seem to have any known addresses, phone numbers, any information on you. - It's because I, I'm in between homes, and I don't have a cell phone. - What was your previous residence? - I don't have one. - You said you were in between homes. - Well that's because I am, literally. I live in a mobile home, out there in Santa Clarita. It's a great location, gorgeous sun rises. - Right. No cell phones. - No, no I don't believe in them. Brain cancer. - Okay, so... What's your relationship with Mickey Rady? - Don't know him. Los Angeles, the City of Angels they say. Everybody here is living the dream. If the American Dream means to have it all, who do you take it from? Name's Kook Packard, or Bill, Joe, Tommy. I was even Francois once, but my accent wasn't the best. Anyway, I consider myself a professional friend. I grew up in the city full of pipe dreamers, delusional bastards, and yeah, smokin' hot broads. All of which I enjoy taking advantage of. I drink too much, smoke like a chimney. I know what's going on today and that's all I give a shit about. Maybe someday things will turn around but in the meantime I love making a living off screwing over the scumbags any way I can. It's an exciting life. Sometimes the perks of the job make it all worthwhile. Like this scum, for example. Now to me a grown man selling kiddie porn mags should be tied up somewhere and clubbed to death. But I'll take setting him up for some jail time and having some nice new wheels. Ah, the Riviera, one of my favorite models. Truth is, if there is such a thing, I've been sideways for so long I don't know how to live straight. Snapping up this sucker's car actually makes me feel so damn good about myself because he's a piece of shit. Guys like this, they just don't deserve the finer things. I love every second I'm throwing these guys to the wolves. Fortunately for me I got a friend that keeps me busy. Well, I use that term loosely. He hates everybody. Anyway it's the closest thing to a friend I've ever had. Happens to be one of the best undercovers I've ever seen. Must be if he busted me. Ah, Mickey Rady, one of the meanest bastards around. Oh, and in case you think I write like a two year old, go fuck yourself. The past couple of years we been working together. Every now and then I get a fancy car for helping him out and some nice cash. I mean, what can I say, sometimes you give and sometimes you take. But if you do, make sure it's from the right people. Because this tale right here ladies and gents, this is the beginning of where it all went wrong. I'm losing it. Gave this woman my real name. Can't believe I slipped. I think I'm falling for her. It's hard to tell. Her name is Eve, or so she says. I been in this fuckin' scum world so long I don't know what's real and what's not anymore. What am I even fighting for? The good guy, the bad guy, there ain't no such thing. Everyone's got an agenda. And it's god damn nasty what some people will do to get what they want. Myself included. Hey. Hey. You got a booking coming up? - Hollywood's calling. - God damn. Her eyes are open for a minute and she's beautiful. You know all you gotta do is let me know where you're gonna be. Come by, take some pictures, and split the profit with you. - Shoulda known shaggin' a paparazzi's a bad idea. Get outta here. My latest assignment has me holed up in this shit hole downtown apartment. Ah, sorry baby, can't talk. Wish I could but I'm another guy right now. This place smells like piss and cigarettes, probably from me. Yeah, you heard right, Eve thinks I'm a fucking paparazzi. Whatever gets me in, no shame here. I'm numb to it all. I used to be a cop for the good. To protect and serve and all that bullshit. Now I protect myself and serve whatever hell I can to the pieces of shit this city produces. And I make damn sure I get mine. Just like everybody else, I got my reasons. Got a call from Chief McCoy this morning. He wants to talk. Can't fuckin' wait. - Well, sit. Ah, this guy, always up my ass. He's got something to prove. Sittin' there acting like he can read. Playing the game. I'll help you buddy. Brown bangers and Armenian drugs, huh? That's a recipe for disaster. - They'll light Boyle Heights on fire. And my whole department with it. - Stack units? - Don't think I don't see what you're doing. - What am I doing? - Your bust is now running four weeks over, and I been looking the other way. Now you're arresting people on planted evidence. Oh, shit. - Jamal Dean. - You son of a-- - Mm-hmm. Look, undercover has liberties, but you're too far out. You are not messing this up for me, you bozo. Been working this score for months. Please don't do anything stupid. - All over my department-- - Oh, man. - I sure as hell can't use a cop who's out there giving them a reason to do so. I sure hope you appreciate me cleaning up after you. - There's nothing to clean, Art. - Rady. - Jamal Dean is my snitch. Don't know why you just didn't ask me, what do you think I booked him for. Oh God, Art. Look, I got a big coke and hooker bust coming up. This is probably the best publicity your department has seen in months. It's an escort ring that's running drugs, I found the source, and he's high profile, and I am this close to finding out where that next drop is. It's Armenian drugs, Art. You, the department need this just as much as I want it. I need a little more time. - Okay. One week. You bring it in clean I may change my mind about you. - I guess I'll see you at the press conference then, huh? Wear the blue tie. - Hold up. Extension comes with a bonus. That's a sliced hooker. Homicide doesn't know the scene as well as you do. - Yeah, it's the only way those ugly bastards get laid. - Oh come on, just see what you can find. - Homicide, huh? Is this Lenny's case? - You know, I want those bastards off the streets just as much as you do. Now you fuck this up, you're out. Mm-hmm? Oh my lord, sit down, quit acting silly it ain't working no more. - Why do you always got to cut me down, huh? Want me to tell you about him? - Yeah. Ah, my favorite dive. Good tunes, good whiskey, and my gal Rosie. She gives great advice sometimes, even though she's a Class A fuck-up herself. But like I said, I'm a professional friend, and Rosie's great for free shots and 50 bucks for a couple of weeks. Hell, all I gotta do is listen. Want to tell me how you found me. - Follow the trail of Bourbon breath, wasted existence-- - Yeah, yeah, look why don't we cut this short and why don't you just tell me what conjugal duties my brother fulfilled this time around, huh? This is Aveline. And before I explain, excuse me for a moment. I got one hour. Two would be better. - Shut up. In case you were wondering, we've done this before. - Another one? - Lori. A sweet kid. Normally I'd be staring at her ass, but I'm just not in the mood today. You know, you should start giving discounts to police. - Now if I did that the streets would be even more unsafe, 'cause you'd all be in here all day drinking beer. - It's what everybody thinks we do anyway, right? - Well let's not disappoint them. - Thanks. - Yes budget cuts have been made in the Los Angeles Police Department. And now we're looking at sky rocketing crime rates. - One more, Lori. Thanks. I mean, does our police force work at the capacity-- More bullshit. Can't get away from it. Wish I could snap this guy's neck. Ah, great. - What's up buddy? - Couple of beers. - Two fucktards walk into a bar. What do you want? - I just can't stop in and grab a beer now? God, I would love to break his face. - All right, all right, you got me. This guy, hell of a cop, huh, sharp. Relax, Mickey. - Just wanted to meet up, compare notes. You're on my case, you're on my team, right? - Well, the chief assigned me, so. - Nice. They must be running out of dirty vice pussies for you to investigate. - Mm, deep breaths. Lori, I want to get out of here. Thanks. - Alrighty, Mick, you let me know when you got something, okay? - New suit. That was fun. - See you later. - Was I that bad? What'd you want to talk about anyways, something wrong with the kid? - I'm late. Well that's what I get for having a kid with my brother's wife. Poor bastard has no idea little Madison's not even his daughter. Or that his wife likes being choked from behind. Christ she smells good. - Who'd have thought my only friend is a fucking con artist. He's the best I've ever seen. And he gets his kicks from the same stuff I do, so it makes working together pretty easy. Do I trust him? That's a tough one. Like I said, everyone has their own agenda. He hasn't let me down yet though, and he's always stocked with good beer. I been working on something, real big score. So let's see what the doctor says. Want me to book you for car theft, or possession of illegal substances? - Guilty as charged. Come on in. How you doin' pal? - I been better. It smells like a woman in here. Want a beer? - What do you think, I want a hug? And while you're up have you got some ice? What'd you do, blast somebody? - Yeah, a little bit. Jesus Christ. Ah, no ice. Try this. - That'll do. Thanks. All right. - So what's up? - Chief raggin' on me today about planted evidence. - Was it? - Well, it had to be done. Nice car you got out there. - Ain't that a beauty? Sure is. '65 Riviera. - Sharp car. You know, we booked that old guy for child pornography. - Good, fuck 'im. - Nobody's missing him, nobody's missing the Riviera. That car might come in handy for a little something I've been checking into. - What's that? - I got a modeling agency that's doubling as an escort service. - I already like where this is going. - It's a coke running escort service. - Even better. - It's a real opportunity we got here. All we gotta do is find out when the next trade off is, and we're gonna crash the deal, and go in there and take half the cash, take half the coke, make it disappear so it's even. I'm gonna stay there and play it like a real bust. And that's it, it's a straight shot. - What's the Kelley Blue Book? - Hundred grand. So let me show you what I'm looking into here. I think you're gonna like this, pal. This is the owner of the escort service. Ms. Donna Lang. - Donna Lang. - Remember her? - Are you kidding, I grew up with this broad. Before your time. Nah, she's terrific. - Thought you'd appreciate that. Now this guy right here is her supplier, might look familiar too. This is Connor Winkler. - As in Mayor Winkler's son? - Yeah, that's junior. - Jesus Christ. - He's got his old man's sense for politics. This guy here is running a deal over with the Armenians. And it seems like his dick can never say no to a chick. And lately he can't say no to this one beautiful actress, right here. Oh, well that's a given. - Also happens to be one of Donna's girls. Got him. Doesn't take much to get Kook going. Booze, boobs, and money, in any order usually works. Anyway, this is the big one. Here we go. - Watch and learn kids. Excuse me, I'm Kook Packard, investments. A good friend of mine recommended your selection of hand models. - Of course Mr. Packard. I'll just have to get the book. - Hey, money does buy you time, dear. Well, somebody needs a spankin'. 3 p.m., three. Whatever happened to pen and paper? 2 p.m. - Here you go Mr. Packard. - Let's see what we have here. Let's see. Oh, hello. Take this beautiful creature right here. - Great. - Let's say 2 p.m. today for lunch, okay? - You got it. - Pleasure to meet you. You should be a hand model yourself there. Nice meeting you. Perfect. Nice to see a room full of pretentious LA douchebags. And I just spotted my mark. I gotta say, this is a personal thrill for me. I grew up watching this woman on TV, and spent a lot of lonely nights... - This suit your taste? - You know what I'm talking about. Work for you? We'll take it. - Great. Here you go. - Oh, hey. - Yes. - How 'bout a bottle of Louis Gerdeaux Montrez Chez. - Excellent choice. - Thank you. - Be right back with that. - Appreciate that. Well, my mom always taught me that to charm a woman, a true gentleman must pay her attention. So guess what, you've got my undivided attention. - You really are a gentleman, aren't you? - I try. Just not tonight, kid. 'Cause there's my girl. Oh man, Donna fucking Lang. This might be my favorite play yet. Comes close to the time I convinced an old Hollywood producer that I was his illegitimate son, and he paid for my whole life for about a year. 'Til the fucker died. Okay, here we go. I know you. - Excuse me, pardon me. I didn't mean to interrupt. I could not help but invite the great Donna Lang to a bottle of lowly Gerdeaux. This is a once in a lifetime chance. First of all, my name is Kook Packard. And I just want to say that I am a tremendous, tremendous fan of your work. - Well, it's a pleasure to meet you. - Yes. Not a quiet minute with this one around, huh? - That's very charming, but he doesn't have a clue what you're talking about, Mr. I'm sorry, what was your-- - Packard, Packard, but call me Kook, call me Kook. - Kook, okay. - Shirley Summers. - Don't know her. - No, no, no, no, that's who Miss Lang portrayed. I mean, we are talking about one of the most iconic characters in TV history. Oh, you know, I mean, this. What was that, just a few years ago? - Oh, please it was an eternity ago. - Oh, come on. - Why don't you have a seat with us, darling. - No, I've interrupted enough. I just want to say Miss Lang, that it truly is my honor to meet you. I'm thrilled. - Thank you. - To meet you. - Thank you so much. - Nice to meet you to there. Please enjoy the wine. - What a gentleman. - And now we close the deal. Well we meet again. Have to met the lovely Isabella here? - Ah, nah. - Nice to meet you. - I'm gonna get the car. - What the hell are you doing here, huh? - Don't think you're the only one paying for her company, okay. - I don't want hookers wearing that, okay? - For God's sake, just play along, will ya? Ha-hey. - Go to hell. - You too. - Hey what is that, suede? - Yeah, it's suede. - God, I just love awkward moments. - Is that a 1965 green Riviera? - Like it? - That is my car, like it? - Ah ah, that's Shirley's car. - Oh my God, I love it. - Hey, want to go for a spin? - Come on, it's yours? - No I stole it. Come on. You want to drive? Oh I'd love to, thank you. - After you, my lady. Thank you, Santos. How 'bout you guys, want to come along? - No I think since I got company, I'm gonna stay at the bar. - All right I'll tell you what, why don't you watch out for the girl and I'll take the lady here. Mulholland it is. Let's roll, honey. Whoo! And that's how it's done. I should write a book, Me and Donna Lang Sitting in a Tree. After about 10 minutes I told Donna to pull over because the car was overheating. That was a lie. She's a doll, but watching her drive is like watching a blind kid play catch. Sooner or later, they gotta stop. - Kookie, Kookie, lend me your comb. You know, I think I still have a copy of that record somewhere in my house. - You gotta be kiddin'. - That cannot be your real name. - Well it's about as real as Shirley Summers. - Touche. - You know, you're not the only one with a past. My dad was one of the creators of 77 Sunset Strip. - Really. I believe I read for that show once. - You probably did. Actually my two older brothers, they got away with pretty decent names. One's Stewart the other one's Jeff. - I see, so when you were born Kookie was the only name left? - Yeah, apparently, apparently. - I find that very hard to believe. - What are you gonna do? - Kookie Packard, old Hollywood royalty. - That's me. - So, Prince Charming, when is this thing gonna be cool enough to drive? - Oh, just a few more minutes here my little leopard. - I'm not in any rush. Good to know. Scenic route it is. And I'm driving. - I don't know what the hell you want me to do here, Art. Lenny made it pretty clear he doesn't want me on his case, so. Is that what he said before or after you knocked his tooth out. - Uh, before. I don't care what the beef between the two of you is. We got a guy who killed a hooker. And for all we know he'll do it again. And again, and again, and a-- - I gotta go. - Can you zip me up. - Yeah. She messes with my head pulling stuff like this. She knows it kills me. Just start charging you. Business? - It always is. - Hey, hey, come here. Be careful. I'm serious, Eve. Is out there on the streets, okay. Like you. - Yeah, like me. Animal rights activists have been pushing for the bill for nine years and have taken part in mass demonstrations throughout the nation. - No fuckin' way. Oh fuck. So, this is my casa. Hey wait a second, did they use this on the Rockford Files? - Wow do you have a sharp eye. It's unbelievable. - Season two. What do you say to a night cap Mr. Kookie Packard? Twist my arm. Something about this is too easy. Either that or I'm just that damn good. Should have called for back up. I don't know why I give a damn about this chick. Everything about Eve and I is a lie. But I just can't help it. Anybody have eyes on a brown Challenger downtown LA. We got a late model Dodge Challenger, brown, Lincoln Motel, 1705 Royal Boulevard. There's just something about her. It's like she's just as lost as I am. You're in too deep Mickey. Too deep. - What the fuck, man? Who are you, her boyfriend or something? - Yeah, something like that. Put your arm on that fuckin' pipe. - This is bullshit, man. - Yeah. - You got nothing on me. Beatin' girls to a pulp ain't nothing. Don't fuckin' move. She's here on her own terms. Doesn't look like her own terms to me. Come on, baby. - You should just go, Mick. - What? There's a guy out there killing girls with that car, you know anything about it? - I don't know anything about that. - Look at me Mick, don't, he's a regular. Listen to her. - He's a regular, not a murderer. What the fuck are you doing? I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Good money so this shit doesn't happen. Eve. - Go. My God. The cuffs, before I call my lawyer. You're second base for the Dodgers, huh? - Yeah, that's right. You guys think you can do whatever you want to these girls? Tabloids are gonna love this. - Shit man, this is private. - Not anymore. God dammit, look I'll-- What are you fucking playing at? - I'll give you money, is that what you want, is that what you're looking for, huh buddy? Name your price. - I like that car out there. - You're a fucking idiot. Yeah, if you like it, take it, it's yours. - What else you got? - Look, I just gave you my, stop fuckin' taking pictures man. Keys are there, take it. There's a bat in the back if you want me to sign it. - You all right? You okay to drive home? - I always am. She acts so damn tough. I think I love her. Almost forgot about my new little buddy. No back up. I'm not a cop tonight. He roughed up my girl. And sometimes people just need a fuckin' beatin'. - Oh, whoo. - Boy, there's nothing like vinyl, huh? - I like you more and more by the second. Come on over here. - I can't believe you have this. * Everybody's talkin' 'bout me * Can't wait to say - I love that song. - Ah, uh-oh. Looks like someone could use a refill on her drinky-poo. - Well thank you. Your nose you have. - Just get on back here now. Here you go my little leopard. - Such a gentleman. - Hey. - Hey. - You know what, here's to Shirley Summers. - Oh, that old thing? May she rest in peace. Fuck her. - Whoo. Well look at you. Normally I'd make myself a peanut butter sandwich. It's just my thing. But I'm in a bit of a rush. Well ain't this my lucky day? Sweet dreams, honey. Thanks for the phone, and the earrings. And the necklace. - Fuckin' Kook, gonna get both of us pinched. I hope you left this place clean. God dammit, I'm nervous. Should have taken that extra swig in the car. Am I gonna have to request the report from Art, or are you gonna fill me in? She's my suspect, Rick, come on. - 'Cause of death, gunshot wound to the head. - Yeah. - Projectile is being looked at. No sign of forced entry. - You have anything useful, you have surveillance, you talk to the neighbors? - Nothing. But we'll sure as fuck find something. This ain't good. - What's the matter, too much blood for you? - How's your face doing, Lenny? - Hungry. I could eat the ass out of a horse. That's how hungry I am. Really starving. - Ah, well look what the cat dragged in. - Madison's my daughter. - Well she's my daughter too. - You can't just walk into her school and pretend to be Stewart. You're not her father there. Jeez, what is wrong with you? - What's wrong with me? Hey I'm not the one living in white picket fence land pretending to be something I'm not. - That is different. - How the fuck is that different? - Because I have to do what is right for my child. And nothing is gonna change that. Not this, and not you. Sign this and get it back to me. Stewart is her father, and I want it on paper. Get it back to me. - God. - Ruby? He's right. No more games, it's time. - Why do you keep saying it's time, it's time. Time for what? Huh? Time to go to paradise. I'm here to take you there. Don't you worry. Well that backfired. Sometimes I actually forget I have a heart and that I just want to see my daughter. God she's hot when she's pissed. - Hey. Hey, oh yeah you're mad now. You know what, you had your chance, and you blew it. Yeah. Yeah, ooh you're mad. - Kook. Kook. Sober up. 24 hours away from becoming a suspect to murder. - What? Just a thing you want to hear after finishing off a fifth of Bourbon. You awake yet? - Yeah. She's dead, Kook. - Who's dead? Donna Lang. She's dead. - What do you mean she's dead? Police report said somebody took her out five minutes after you told me you left. - Yeah, I, I went and got her a drink, I only put half a pill in it. It certainly wasn't enough to kill her. You don't think I had anything to do with it, do you? Did you? - No. - Look it's off. - No, man, man you can't call it off, it's not that easy. - No shit it's not that easy. - The only thing the LAPD can find are traces of the actual scumbag who did it. None of this touches us, man. - I got plenty of reasons to pull this thing through, more than you. It's off. Let me show you something. We're done, we're walking. Donna's ringer. - Is that the victim's cell phone? - Yeah. - I should. - Hey! - Are you out of your mind? - No, would you fuckin' relax, they got nothing to trace. - That's the first thing you trace. - It's her secondary, and unless you told them she's got a separate Armenian drug line, they got nothing to trace, would you fuckin' relax. Let me show you something. Come to my party tomorrow. Ball drops at 11 p.m. 1625 Lymone Avenue. You know who wrote that, Winkler Junior. We just got the info for the drop that's going down. And I'm going, fuck am I going. With or without you. In case you were wondering, this is normal. We argue like brother and sister, folks. He's the sister. It always ends well though. If you would just listen to me, and fuck it, where's the whiskey? You know where it is. Told you. And now it's game time. - Hi. - Hello there. - Would you care for a glass of champagne? - I'd be delighted. - I'm Layla, if you need anything let me know. - All right Layla. - Okay. Enjoy yourself. I'll do that. Daddy must be proud. - Hello. How you doin'? I'm good. - Shouldn't you be having a good time? - I am. - I know a lie when I hear one. You gotta say, this is one hell of a ballsy move. Look at this guy. You have no idea what's coming, douchebag. You're gonna buy me a new Winnebago. Pardon me would you, for one second. And the lion is out of the cage. Oh man, to be a fly on the wall when this shit goes down. Good luck, pal. Hey, cheers, huh? Cheers. - Art, it's me. That bust I promised you. It's happening right now, I need back up ASAP. 1625 Lymone Avenue. You got me? All right. - Ah-hah. Sweet. - LAPD, don't move, don't move. You're under arrest for trafficking controlled substances. Put your pieces on the floor by me slow, slow. - That's rich. Turn around. Both of you turn around. - Under arrest. - Get on your knees. Get on your fucking knees right now. Get on your fuckin' knees. Put your arms behind your back. Put your arms behind your back. Try your friend and I'll break your fuckin' face. Don't you move, you fuckin' move. Put your hands behind your back. Put your hands behind your fuckin' back. - Tell you something man, I'm the fuckin' mayor's kid. And I will kill you. - You're gonna get it pig. Shut the fuck up. - All right. You better fuckin' find that guy. I'm not fuckin' around. And get rid of his ass, all right. - I got it. - Nobody moves, nobody dies. - Holy shit. Where the fuck is it coming from. Shut the fuck up, man. Go. Fuck. Sometimes you feel like you're on top of the world. Like you can handle anything that's thrown at you. I feel good tonight. We did it. What the hell happened? - Well, someone who was not our back up just shot up our fuckin' show pal, that's what happened. Let me get a smoke. - Yeah. Dropped mine jumping out of a fuckin' window. Well I take back everything I just said. Just like that I knew our borrowed time was up. We planned for this. Party was gonna end sooner or later. Mick was right, we're in too deep, too close. Time to hit the road, Jack. I'm gonna play this bust tomorrow like I said. Pal, I'm trying to find every angle to keep you clear here. - Yeah, yeah. But I don't know. - It's all right. I guess it's that time, huh? I got your cut. - Little heavier than usual, huh? - Hey. I'll see you in my nightmares, huh? - You got it. Hey Mick. - Yeah. Was it worth it? Take it easy, partner. - You know why Mickey does this? A while back he was undercover. Deep cover, actually. So lo and behold there was an exchange of gunfire with some thugs, and bullets were flying. Mickey decides to empty his clip. Hits a kid. Bullet lodges in the base of the spine. Kid doesn't walk anymore. Mom's on welfare and up 'til this day she never made one payment towards those bills. - Sounds like he's an admirable guy. - Who shot a kid and covered it up, man. - At least he tried to do the right thing. What are you gonna do? - Let me tell you something, Kookie Mickey's gone rogue, you understand? And he's a bigger con than you are. So I'm gonna make it real clear, man. You don't help me with this, you're gonna be a lone wolf in a big cage full of lions for a very long time. These goons. They act like detectives, but they've got one foot out just like everybody else. I don't put anything past these pieces of shit. Just play it cool, Mick, relax. - Armenians plan a big trade off, Latinos crash the party, simple as that. Sending a message to steer clear of their territory. I mean, it was only a matter of time before the rich part of town got hit. - Shane, that was anything but a God damn gang hit. Crew concealing their faces doesn't send a message. You got to show face to show what color you're repping. If that was a gang hit, why wasn't there two dead Armenians in that house. - Could have been kidnapped for all we know. - No, no. The gang woulda popped them right then and there. - Look, I'll give you that, but the rest? - You know what Rick, it just doesn't add up. We're talking Kevlar vests, shooting to kill, semi-automatic weapons, and now the mayor's son is missing. It could have been his own cavalry for all I know. - Whoa. Now I need you to take it slow here. And no information about Winkler's involvement leaves this room. That's political suicide for the department. - Fine then. I got an idea, why don't we talk about where my God damn back up was. That's actual suicide for your department. - You know what? You need to go get your head straight. I'm putting Rick and Lenny on the case. Oh, we're done here. For now. - You think that's enough to keep him from looking into the case? Trailer's gassed up at all times and ready for the desert. Gotta lay low for a bit. Cash is safely tucked away, and I'm outta here as squeaky clean as I came into the world. - LAPD step out of the fuckin' truck. Oh, fuck. - Daniels. Yeah what. What? Oh come on man, you're kidding me. These guys are gonna blow the whole fuckin' thing. No wait, you listen to me, listen to me. Are you close? Okay, you call the chief, you get over there right now. Do me a favor, nobody goes in there until I get there, you hear me? Nobody. You don't talk to him, no one enters that fuckin' room. Yeah, I'm serious. Yeah. Dalton's Autobody, we can talk about that again. Right? That was a mess. Yeah. We all know how that turned out, right? Lot of time and little money. Ah, okay maybe we could talk about the gambling fiasco that happened a few months ago. It was a mess. Didn't turn out well at all, did it Kook? Yeah. Tell you what, maybe we could talk about the the Armenian coke bust. Connor Winkler? Uh-huh. Well we both know how that one turned out too, right? Look, Kookie. I don't need an admission from you, okay, I know who you are. I know what you do. And to be honest, well I've got kind of a soft spot for you. Why, because you're good. And I don't think you have bad intentions like your partner. - I've already told you about 20 times. I don't have bad intentions. And I don't have a partner. - Listen to me very carefully, okay. I've been building a case on Mickey Rady for two years. And at this point in time, you're gonna have to make a choice. Real simple. Either you go away with him or you help me get him. It's that simple. - Can I get that cup of coffee? - Cream and sugar? - Yeah. Hey could someone grab me a coffee, please. Cream and sugar. - Ah, man. - Packard. You got the phone for five minutes. Hey it's me, leave a message. - Well, I ain't calling you from you Miami. Let's just suppose what you mentioned is right. Somebody takes out Donna after I leave. I mean, somebody could have seen me, right? A party gets shot up, and then this morning I take a pinch from LA's finest as a suspect to murder, so I think it's safe to say we pissed in somebody's pool there, pal. And I also think it's safe to say they're probably coming after you next. So why don't you think about bailing me out as soon as you can. There's a shit storm coming, pal. - As you know, we've been covering the recent developments within the Los Angeles police department. Budget cuts and related restructuring. Increasing crimes rates, in particular gang violence and drug related crimes. We asked Mayor Winkler for a comment, but without success. Now, after the Lymone shooting, yet another tragedy involving two innocent fatalities, both Latino men, ages 24 and 22. From what we know at this point, the shooting was gang related, likely triggered by a drug deal gone bad. Rival gangs seem to be battling it out for territory. Drug trafficking, we've seen this before in MacArthur Park where several gangs fought over turf in the mid '90s. - Hey. What? You okay, babe? - No. I was just getting the girls in the van. And then they rolled up and then they just started shooting at us. They shot at us, Mickey, they could have shot our girls. I got you Rady. Oh, I got you. * Life's just a bad dream * Even in my sleep I'm never free * World's such a bad place * Even the man, he lies on TV * But I'm just gonna pick myself up and continue to-- Oh, you thought this shit was over, huh? They just started shooting at us. They shot at us, Mickey. They could have shot our girls. Not even close. * Life's just a bad dream * Even in my sleep I'm never free * World's such a bad place * Even the man, he lies on TV * But I'm just gonna pick myself up * And continue to be * Yeah * Lookin' for the good times * Throw my past up to the wind * Lord I'm searching for a good time * Even if I have to travel from within * A world full of hunger and thirst * And original sin * Yeah yeah Come on. * Ah. Take me. * So let 'em knock me down * I know one day I'm gonna be free * And let 'em turn me all around 'round 'round * People you just got to wait and see * That I'm just gonna pick myself up * And continue to be * Lord I * I'm just gonna pick myself up * And continue to be * Yeah Come on. * Ah. Here I go, pick me up.
