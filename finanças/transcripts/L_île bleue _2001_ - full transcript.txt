THE BLUE ISLAND You have to clear a wall to leave childhood. You heave yourself up... peer over, and discover a different landscape. Then you jump to the other side, because you have no option but to jump. You get over more or less in one piece. Some get hurt and don't recover. Others die both literally and figuratively. These children entered adolescence... by jumping and landing in the midst of a real war. Thank God this age will remain an age of illusion until the end of the world. Robinson... -What are you doing? -I'm watching you. Hello, Mellie. -Who are you? -Bertrand. A friend of Robinson's. You've become a man. You've changed in the last two years. But it's still me. -We were expecting you tonight by train. -I prefer to hitchhike. You prefer surprises. Isn't that it? That's a lovely bracelet. Is it from your girlfriend? No. No, from my mother. I'm sorry. Come on, I'll show you your room. Everyone's on a picnic. They'll be back by the time you've changed. Rabinson'll be delighted to see you earlier than expected. -This is it. -And yours is directly below mine. -You remember everything. -I never forget anything. -What are they talking about in Paris? -The war. Oh, yes. Of course. Oh, sorry. Here are your boots. I didn't think you'd get undressed so quickly. -It's OK. -If I'd barged in on Robinson... -he'd have been furious. -He lives with his parents. I've been a boarder since I was six, so I don't care if you see me naked. Besides, you're in your nightgown. So we're quits. -How long are you staying? -I don't know. The boarding school closed down because of the war. -I give myself a week. -A week to do what? we'll see. A week to get you. Bertrand... My hero. My fiancé. My valiant knight is finally here. Maité, my beautiful princess with the sea-blue eyes. I am at your feet. -Just like last summer. -Get a move on. Zazane's waiting. I'm coming. The blue island. Our island. We're home. Tranquil and free. -Our magical kingdom. -All this is mine. -Is this your dowry? -It'll be yours as soon as we marry. But there's a war on. It could get nasty, with casualties on both sides. -Do you want to be my widow? -T'll be your widow. -And follow the coffin dressed in black? -And cry. -I swear it. -How can you be so sure? How will you die, Bertrand? There are no battles taking place. Zigomar's right. Dad says he's bored to death at the barracks. -The soldiers here don't like war. -Then we'll wage war. What? For no reason? One is always killed in action for no reason. Some know it, others don't. Slow down. Wait for me. I'm the littlest one. Place your bets. Bets are placed, no more accepted. -That Prussian whippersnapper's afraid. -19, 17, 13. -Hitler isn't Prussian. He's Austrian. -Who cares? He's still a Kraut. A phoney war. But you think it could blow up in the end. -17. It's a draw. -Card. 19. The bank wins. OK, let's go. -You're starting again? -Continuing. It's not the same thing. Gaétan, you are the voice of wisdom and concern. You don't understand. Raoul, give me a million. If you only knew... The world could topple any minute. The emptiness, the chasm. Even the magic. That's nothing for you. You're not crazy enough, huh? We're rich, you see? It's easy. Papa, you're coming home later and later. 1 know. -Did you wait up for me? -Not at all. I woke up early. You're sweet but you're a bad liar. -What's the matter, Papa? -I'm tired. Of this war which is dragging its feet... I love you, you know? But... If we keep selling everything, there'll be nothing left in here. No. -You can't leave me. You're all I have. -I've lost the chateau, Mellie. -Wasn't there a mortgage on it? -I played for the mortgage and lost. -We'll be all right. We always are. -No, Mellie. It's over. This time it's really over. I guess I'll have to...I don't know... -I'll have to go to work. -You don't know how to do anything. That's exactly the problem. Listen, I could... No. We'll find some other way. Come on, lie down. What about mother's jewelry in the safe? Oh, my little girl. It's been a long time since... Not the pearl necklace. -You still have your grandma's pearls? -Of course. They're in my chest. -Stashed away for an emergency. -Really? Yes, you're right. I could use it to recoup my losses. I won the other night, you know? I have a system. It's infallible. -You'll win tonight. -Yes. Now lie down. In the meantime, have a good rest. See you in a bit. -Did your father lose again? -No, Aunt, he won. We're rich. That's certainly good news. If you believe it. Mademoiselle Lavallée is waiting for you in the salon. -Serve the tea. Tell her I'm coming. -Yes, sir. This is lovely. -You're urge to collect will drive you mad. -It already has. It's kind of you to come bid a soldier farewell. -An unexpected pleasure. -I didn't come to say goodbye. I've changed my mind. My answer is yes. What a surprise. Two days ago you didn't love me. Now at 8 in the morning... Don't tell me that you love me. -Do you? -T'll marry you. -Isn't that what you want? -Of course. Well? I'm delighted. Surprised but delighted. What a day. Here I am leaving for the front. And now I'm engaged. Look, we make a good couple, don't we? 1 knew you were made for me. People will be so jealous... and we'll make beautiful children. You always get what you want, don't you? Usually, yes. When 1 desire it with all my heart. I'm leaving in an hour. We'll celebrate our engagement on my next leave. I'll try to return as soon as possible. -If that suits you? -Yes, absolutely. In the meantime, could you write out a check to help out my father? -How much? -Two million. -That's a lot. Let's say one million. -One and a half million. -You're redoubtable. -That displeases you? On the contrary. If you protect my interests as much as you protect your father's... you won't be just a beautiful wife, a showpiece I can parade... but you'll be very useful as well. See you soon. - You will love me someday, - T'll be your wife. You'll love me as a lover. -1 like your craziness. -It's a start. -Definitely. -I have some trumps in my hand. You're rich, young, attractive, intelligent. What more could you want? Nothing, really. Well, to be honest... -love. -You're right, love. Do you believe in love? We'll have fun, I promise you. That's precisely what I'm hoping. What did she want? You lost. She wants to marry me. She's only after your money. Do you have time for a last game? I always do. -Why? Do you think I'm so ugly? -Don't be childish. She hasn't got a dowry. Her father's gambling killed her poor mother. No, she had an automobile accident. No, that's just the official version. I want Mellie. Don't ever forget that. From now on, I want you to treat her as family. You'll spoil our last game. You'll always be the most important woman in my life. -You're such a charmer, André. -And you're not? Nicholas De Nemours killed himself when you refused him. I wonder... did you reject him or leave him? Tell me before 1 leave for war. -How dare you? I'm your mother. -Exactly. And you're a widow and the most beautiful woman in the world. Well? Did you reject the handsome Nicolas? Or did you leave him? I've forgotten. My uncle told the priest that the game's up. It'll start in a week. -What? -The real war. -Are the Germans strong? -No idea. -What about us? -I don't know. But they're pissed off. -Wait. I'm the littlest. -You're always the littlest. I'll always be the littlest. Even next year. A penny for your thoughts, Papa. -I was asking myself why I gamble. -Maybe because Mother's dead. Yes. That at least would be... No. I was already a gambler when your mother was alive. I've always been a gambler. Because you like living intensely. -What's this? -André's helping us out. Do you think I'll accept this? I won't let you sell yourself... -For 12 million. -I asked for two but he refused. -This isn't a joke. -But I like André. -He loves collecting, too. -Then why did you turn him down? -It was a gamble. I'm your daughter. -Precisely. I want you to be happy. Happy. To be happy always. -André promised me happiness. -No, I like it when you're frivolous. Devoted wives have always bored me. I'm not making a sacrifice. I find André amusing. Besides, Papa, I want to be a woman. A wife. -But not yet. -Yes, now. -No. -Yes. No. Do whatever you want. I'm going to marry André. -Our coachman's waiting for us. -Old Kolb is still here? Though we don't pay him. He has nowhere to go. -Kolb likes playing with us. -Charge! I've decided to leave for eastern Prussia. -What about our attack on the Indians? -We killed them all last year. Yes, it's better to attack the Prussians. This time we're hussars. Zazane, this will be a dangerous voyage. We might not return alive. Have you decided? Are you brave enough? -Yes. -Prove it. Show us how brave you are. -Like during the other holidays? -Yes. -What do you say to that? -You're so uncouth. Good, Zazane. You're beautiful. Maité, this will be a dangerous voyage. Have you made a decision? Are you brave enough? -Yes. -I want you to address me. -What is your response? -My answer is yes. The show us. Prove it. 1 didn't wear my underpants on purpose. On guard. The enemy is coming. -And so the dream was born again. -Draw your swords. The dream in which I was the hero, the victor. Monsieur Bertrand, they're attacking us in thousands. Girls, get in position. Bull's eye. You mean, he's dead. Rescue me, I'm scared. They got me, I'm hit. Hurry. He's wounded. Call for help. Tell my wife I wasn't a coward until the very end. Tell my children that I was killed in action. And that I was a hero. The cavalry is coming. Maité, reload my rifle. I have to avenge Zagomar. Avenge me, too. They burned down my house. -I got him. I got the chief. We're free. -You always the one who kills him. Oh, look, I found a little cat. -What are you doing? -Playing war. And I found a kitten. It's time to sit down at the table. -Your father still hasn't written. -He's busy. In Indochina, guarding the pearl of the empire. Your mother, the dancer-- is she there, too? Don't talk about my mother. You always say you're Bertrand Carré, the son of Captain Carré and Aisha. Don't talk about that anymore. -Are you ready, children? -We're almost done, Mama. Is your cousin Mellie engaged to anyone? Not officially. But, yes, to André d'Estanville. -That guy's an idiot. -But you've never met him. Yes, two years ago. He's vulgar, arrogant. -André's fighting the Krauts. -Yeah, I bet he's really taking it easy. -Hurry up, boys. Come and sit down. -We're coming. -Six. 1,2, 3,4,5, 6. -Monsieur, you're cheating. -Runs in the family. I always cheat. -Papa's right. You've got to cheat. The objective is not to be had. Here comes Eugénie and her goose-step. 1 feel tired just watching her. -Qut for a jog, my dear? -No need to harness up for two kilometers. I got a letter from André. I came over at once to bring it to his fiancée. -How considerate of you. -I'm just doing my duty. Aren't you going to read it? It's a letter from my son. Your fiancé. -In a minute. -Sit down, Eugénie. -You must be exhausted. -No. I have to leave right away. I just brought over the letter, because I thought... -T'll accompany you back. -I hate to inconvenience people. I really do. Good night. Dutiful woman. God forbid. Don't you ever become one. -You can count on me, Papa. -You're not being fair to Eugénie. If she takes my bracelet before her turn, she'll come to my bed tonight. -I'm going to win. Whose turn is it? -Mine. -No, it's mine. -See how much fun it is to cheat? -Mellie, Bertrand's sending you to jail. -He's hounding me. When my turn comes, I'll show no mercy. See you later, my sweet dream... I love you, Mellie. Mellie, I love you. I love you, Mellie. Mellie, I love you. Bertrand, did you want something? André sent me these hats from Paris. 1 don't know when I'll wear them here. This is so ridiculous. We keep barging in on each other. First the Charleston, you in shorts... and now me wearing a veil. I love you, Mellie. That's impossible. Why? I don't know. I'm engaged. -There's a war on. -Don't tell me you love that guy. You haven't even read his letter. No. André is out there in a trench somewhere. Maybe under attack. What trenches? No one's being attacked yet. Stop it, Bertrand. Are you afraid of love? You can resist all you want, but one day you'll be mine. -You're only 14. -That doesn't matter. That's enough. No, stop. I've had enough of this. And kids should be in bed at this hour. You had no right to say that. Not you. One talked about the Legion, with good reason. They were the ones fighting. All volunteers, they had their heroes, their mystique, their acts of heroism. They were awarded medals, the papers were filled with their exploits. And Bertrand wrote on a piece of paper:... "I give my son to France. Make him a hero." Signed: Aisha, oriental dancer. But it's still unbelievable. He could have left a note, a letter. -Maybe he had to go home. -Home? The boarding school is closed. -His dad's in Indochina. His mother... -So Aisha really exists? -Why? Doesn't she exist? -Hello? Miss? You know the telephonist has a sick mother. Hello? Oh, finally. Miss, could you get me the police? It's urgent. -I'll hold. -We can't find him anywhere. -No one's seen him. -Are you quite sure? Think. I saw him last night at one. I don't understand. I left him in his room at 10:30. He told me he was going to bed. -Is this the recruitment office? -At the back to the left. I demand to be sent to the Commander of the French Legion. My name is Bertrand Carré, the son of Captain Carré of the Foreign Legion. -I'm an excellent marksman and fighter. -Enlist at your age? You sure have the nerve, kid. -Why are you all dressed in black? -Just in case. Have you checked your hunting rifles? -Why do you say that? That's awful. -There are also wells, ditches. -True. -Let's check the island. No, let's go to the Devil's Bridge. A lot of suicides take place there. The police are looking into it. I mentioned your husband's position. Good. I'm sure we'll find him. We were very worried. You shouldn't just take off like that. He tried to enlist in the French Legion. He sure is a tough one. -Good for you. I'm proud of you. -Kolb's right. Very good. I wanted to do the same thing at your age. I still do. But France doesn't want us. Too bad for us dyed-in-the-wool patriots. That poor kid. He's left to his own devices. What are you doing in the dark? You gave me quite a fright, you know? Bertrand... No one wants me. Neither you nor the war. Did you take off because of me? -Does that make you cross? -No, on the contrary. I'm very happy that you're back. I thought I'd never see you again. You know... It's the first time for me as well. I've never seen such a lack of pretentiousness. Pure grace. Maité performed a kind of ritual. She was the only one who prayed in this manner. -What's she doing? -She's baptizing herself. -She's beautiful. -Yes. When she looks at me... 1 feel the same way. -Do you think she loves Bertrand? -No. She only loves herself. Pagan prayers. She wanted to rule supreme in Bertrand's heart. She didn't love him, but he belonged to her. -What's that? -The flag of chance. -That doesn't make any sense. -Exactly. That's why it's beautiful. Upon the body of our glorious comrade, we vow that Germany... shall never soil the holy ground of the Blue Island, our fatherland. Swear it. I swear. Too bad you're dead. Now you'll never get to see this again. -You're mean. He's dead at the moment. -We'll see about that. The first one to get to the locks wins. You have no right to overtake me. You're dead. Wait for me. That's not fair. I wish you happiness, André, even though you are taking Mellie from me. It causes me great pain to lose her. I entrust you to her. Mellie is your precious treasure but also the dream of my life. 1 promise to make her happy. -How dare you? -He didn't do it on purpose. You didn't do it on purpose, did you? I'm sure he must be ill. And he's also young. Stay. We won't let a drunk kid spoil our engagement party. Robinson, go with him. Besides, it's only a dress. -I'm going to kill that asshole. -Hurry. He's only got 24 hours' leave. Life is nothing but absence. Love without memory. We exist in nothingness. What's the matter with you? Are you sick? I love her. I love Mellie. So you and Maité... -Operation Camouflage accomplished. -Not bad. Except that Bertrand's a bit nuts. These antitank defenses are useless. -Why do you say that? -The German tanks will use the road. -So you don't think they'll attack here? -Well, we made that vow, anyway. That's Bertrand for you. Woman, this is for the mobile unit. -Thank you, my man. -Great, huh? -Has Robinson kissed you on the mouth? -Yes. Has Bertrand kissed you? No, before I let him kiss me, he has to perform some kind of feat. Good. In case someone gets wounded. A chivalrous deed. Maybe T'll let him kiss me later. -You're a pretty complicated person. -Well, I love legends. This is no time to clown around. What's with this khaki garb? 1 bet this was your idea. Going to the front? -What about you? -The Krauts invaded Belgium. -The situation is serious. -Listen, Papa... I heard it on the British radio. It's a big military offensive. War isn't a game. Men are dying as we speak. Too bad you're too young to understand. Maité, go home. Come on, get moving. -Now we're free. No more school. -Did the Germans take our schools? -No, Cossacks. -The real war: summer holidays. We'll stop the Krauts at the Marne. Like in '14. Counterattack. -We'll be in Berlin in two days. -Kill the Chancellor. Crush the uhlans in Berlin. Defeat the uhlans. As the father of the uhlans, as the son of the uhlans, as a uhlan myself. Everyone is going to die. And I thought the Maginot Line... The Maginot Line is just a bunch of crap. -A lie they feed us gullible people. -Your father just phoned the ministry. -There have been considerable losses. -That's normal. It's war. You don't know what you're talking about. I experienced the Great War. Father left with the cry: "To arms!" He died in the trenches. And my fiancé was killed on the first day. -Do you think we could lose the war? -We've already lost it. Don't talk like that, Papa. Bertrand, you're crazy. You could fall. Why did you lock your door. Already five nights. You don't speak to me. You don't look at me. -I'm afraid, Bertrand. -Of what? Your mother-in-law? I'm sorry, Mellie. But please understand. You're here, so close, and I can't touch you. It's driving me mad. I have to think of André. What if he's been taken prisoner? Or wounded? You don't owe him anything. You're not his wife. You don't love him. -But now things are different. It's war. -Yes, we could all die any minute. I want you. I fill up my days with Robinson and my other friends. But at night, I'm obsessed with you. I love you. So you love me half the time. During the other half, you're 14. If you tell me you don't love me, I'll go away. -Anyone home? -Hide. I'll go see who it is. I'm coming, darling. -It's Jean. I'm sure of it. -It's a government car. -It's you. -Please excuse this late intrusion... -but in view of the circumstances... -Come in. -You're not alone? -Just the driver and the secretary. Where's the phone? This is Mr. Clapart, Jean's colleague at the Ministry. -The head of his cabinet. -My brother, my son, my niece. Charmed, I'm sure. Excuse me. The minister is coming. I must make a call. -But the telephonist is sleeping. -Now that's very annoying indeed. You've left the files in the trunk. Anyone could steal them. -Monique, run... -But you know I have a bad back. Do I have to do everything around here? -What an oddball. -Dad calls him Gasometer. He's all hot air. I guess they're staying here. You take care of them. -Robinson, go get Bertrand. -No, Aunt, he's sleeping. Leave him be. -You assume he's sleeping, don't you? -Do you have a safe? Your files are in no danger here. Who exactly is coming? This is top secret. The government has left Paris. I cannot tell you where they went. The minister will arrive here tomorrow. I'm in charge. I haven't slept in days. -I'm sure they'll return to Paris soon. -She's right. So let's go back to bed. I'll leave you in charge. All right. Follow me, sir. Good night, Mellie. Sleep tight. -It's the head of the cabinet. -I heard. He's a bit weird. Minister Chabanais is coming. A name like that of a brothel. -Is he worthy of all this commotion? -What can we do? 1, Bertrand Carré, 14 years old, marksman and knife-thrower... willing to fight hard, and madly in love... I'd wipe the slate clean and start all over again. -You're crazy. -This looks like it belongs in a brothel. -Do you want it? -No, it's your mother's bracelet. -What if the others saw it on me? -No, it's just for when we're alone. You belong to me. I'll nail you down here, so you'll never budge again. I love you. Do you love me? Say it. I love you. Well, this certainly isn't Deauville. Riri, we're here. The poor man's worn out. It isn't fun being a minister in times like these. We're not staying long. The situation is worse than you can imagine. -Where are you going? -Bordeaux. -I'm going with you. -Me, too. No, you stay here. Here you'll be a lot safer. -After Bordeaux? -I don't know. Maybe North Africa. To continue the fighting. -Thank you. -I know the house, Mr. Minister. I'll take you to your room. The Minister of Public Works is nearby in Bonneuil. And the wife of the Haitian ambassador. I've arranged a dinner. -Is it really a good time for a dinner? -It'll take your mind off of things. -Hello, Mr. Minister. -Oh, my dear friend. -This way, Minister. -Hello. -I'm Lily Palma of the Parisian Follies. -Delighted. Lavallée. What a to-do with these Germans. Thanks to Riri... I would have been "Fifi". At the Chatalet no less. -And bang! It was cancelled. -A pity. The Germans love tear-jerkers. But "Fifi" isn't a tear-jerker. You're pulling my leg, aren't you? -I wouldn't dare, mademoiselle. -You're a very unusual man. A real gentleman. But my motto is: never have any regrets. -And I'd never have met you otherwise. -Indeed. And this country air. Goodness, it's so revitalizing. She's been in there for half an hour. Enough is enough. -You let so much mail pile up. -I'm tired. I can't sleep in the country. I've taken over. Don't worry, the letters will be ready to sign in an hour. -You've got quite an assistant. -A man who does his work. -Even if he is pathetic. -The water heater makes such a racket. What an adventure. Just look at Mistouflet's head. Wait 'til I tell my friends. They're be very amused. -She's charming. -You think so? Now go for a walk, Mistouflet. Do you see this plant? It only flowers once every two years. Its flowers will bloom next month. Well, you certainly have important things on your mind. -I didn't sleep a wink last night. -Was it the roosters? Dogs? Birds? You. You... and you. All T could think of was you. 1 know, that sounds crazy. But that's life... Well, what will we do about it? -What do you mean by that? Who? -You and me. You've obviously got off the merry-go-round of life. But I'm telling you, "Here I am. Get back on. I want to make you happy." My life is here. Truth is, I don't give a damn about Paris and the theatre. Well, your... -He'll be broken-hearted. -Riri? -Yes. Riri. -Oh, I know. Poor Riri. But what can you do? Love is... The flesh is weak. Everyone knows that. Yes, everyone knows that. -But there's also a war on. -Oh, right. All right, I understand. I guess you don't find me attractive. Lily, men always find you attractive. You know that. Apparently not all. Here's the proof. But I'm not the melancholy sort. A candlelit dinner was served. Chabanais felt personally threatened by the Luftwaffe. The table was ringed with wan, drawn faces and reddened eyes. Some had been traveling all night, yet would not give up... this posthumous celebration of their political futility. A wonderful soirée, Mademoiselle. The final sigh of an ending world. -Have you read Femina Marquez? -I must confess I haven't. It's a novel by Valéry Larbaud. About Haitian children... who are sent to France for their studies. And later... Yes, so they can be taught, and immersed in, your culture. They are welcomed like heroes upon their return. Your country is treated with an emation akin to religion over there:... France, the mother of arms, arts, and law. They are dropping bombs. And not too far away at that. We can't let Elise's meal go to waste. You will dine with us. You, too, Kolb. And now we can say we dined at the chateau... -Kolb? -Aren't you hungry, Kolb? -I don't like it when war turns real. -And he's out of place here. Everyone, sit down. We've got to stick together now. -May I really, sir? -Sit down. Children and servants at the table. Everything's falling apart. -Poor France. -All these forks are confusing. Take the spoon-shaped fork for fish. -That's absurd. -Then take any one you like. Don't draw attention to yourself. -Chateau Beychevelle '34, Mr. Minister? -Of course, Count. -I love you, Papa. -I love you, too. -You'll miss school because of the war. -I hope not. -My daughter told me you like school. -Well, we have this schoolteacher... -Sexy? -Not her. It's her dresses. -Don't have such a big mouth. -Do you ever think of love, Maité? -That's all girls think about. -On the contrary. The boys have the problems. During war, say. You're making fun of us. What do you care? She's got her war, and we've got ours. -22. -Who is it? -Cousin Mellie. -I'll go anyway. I'll go with him. I'll take care of Mellie. -Wow. -Not junk, that's for sure. -Aren't you disappointed? -Disappointed? Why? -Because of this disaster. And the war. -Do you really think that war is fun? Yes. 1 would be the warrior's repose. -How old are you, Maité? -I'm 13. -Is that fitting for a 13-year-old? -Our troops are fleeing. Is that fitting? Don't push your luck, Maité. Do you expect to hold up the German tanks with a 5-5? We'll stop them simply because we're here. Sure. They'll run away as soon as they see us. -I hit it. -Can I shoot, too? -I said no. -Just once. I'm your second officer. -And how about me? -Only Maité. -And me? -I said, only Maité. -What are you doing? -We're playing. -I heard shots. -It's war. We're not cowards. -Target practice. -That's Papa's rifle. Did you steal it? We just borrowed it. Why did you take that rifle? To defend Bertrand's Blue Island. We'll defend it to the bitter end. We have to. We took a vow. You could kill someone. -Give back that rifle. -No, it's too dangerous. If you love me, you'll give it back to me. How about you? Do you love me? Yes. You know I do. André is coming back. He's been wounded, but it'll be fine. I'll take care of him. A mother knows how to take care of her son. He will get better. You just have to have faith. And pray. Pray. I must hurry. I have to get everything ready for his arrival. Coachman... Stop. If they tell you André's dead, don't you believe a word of it. My son is on his way home. Tonight I will hold him in my arms. Goodbye. -We just saw Eugénie. She's a bit... -Mellie's fiancé is dead. -She told us that wasn't true. -That he was wounded. I saw the telegram. It said he was dead. Poor Madame Eugénie, she's going out of her mind with grief. -Where's Mellie? -In the park, I think. -What's the matter with him? -I have no idea. I'm frightened, Bertrand. I feel so guilty. So very guilty. You don't owe him. You weren't his wife. No, what we're doing is wrong. We shouldn't see each other anymore. -You haven't done anything wrong. -You haven't, either. And that boy. He must be very unhappy. Surely he must be afraid of losing you. -Whom are you talking about? -Bertrand. You see, I don't sleep too well at the moment. So at night, in the halls... Naturally I was a bit shocked at first. Every love that comes your way is good. -Are you talking about Mama? -Mama. But also about the others. Life is long. You'll see. -Not always. -No. Not always. You're right. Who knows what tomorrow will bring? -What's going on? -This is it. The real war. Happy now? -The Germans are coming. -What if they found the island empty? -They wouldn't know it belonged to us. -It'd be as it it'd never existed. As if we'd never existed. Captain, you can see you're disrupting the town. -Wars are usually disruptive, Mayor. -The marshal called a stop to the war. -As long as one French soldier... -You intend to stop the Germans here? You'll destroy a village that asks nothing of you except peace? -He's defending our honor. -Madame Poirier... the school is your domain. But here, 1 decide. But we, too, are torn. On the one hand, it's a matter of honor. I know. -That's why I'm asking you to pull out. -And give up one's honor? Madame Poirier, be quiet. Tell your superiors your guns are jammed. Then honor'll remain intact. You have no right to give me orders. 1 don't take orders from anyone. The armistice has not yet been signed, so I'll stay here... -ready to fight the enemy. -My son... my son, listen to me. This is a matter of Christian charity. Think of the mothers of your men, of their fiancées... -It's no crime against honor... -Get the hell out of here. -We have no need of cowards. -Captain, pull out. Otherwise I'll go in person to the Germans to negotiate...with honor... -a way to save my village. -You will not do that, Mayor. No, at least he's not a coward. He's right. We have to fight. We have to crush those Krauts. Captain, someone's coming. Someone from headquarters. Attention! At ease. Who is the commanding officer here? -I am, General. -Amazing. We were expecting to find the Germans here. They must be late. Unless you're early. -I hear you want to put up a fight. -Affirmative, General. I don't blame you nor give orders to the contrary... but do you have any idea where the generals' headquarters are? -Negative, General. -In Montauban. Would you have thought that? Montauban. You have done more than your duty. -But we've run out of gasoline. -Then march, my friend. March. And make sure that you stay free. Alive. I myself demand that of you. -How easy it is to bring someone around. -But he's going away. -The captain was defending honor. -Yes, but he was taking on your role. Did you hear? Maréchal Pétain killed himself. -Who said that? -I heard it on the radio. -He said: I have given myself to France. -He didn't kill himself. He's now head of France. He's trying to get Germany to stop the war. Let him kill himself. The marshal of France shouldn't capitulate. -It's not as simple as that. -Yes, it is. A soldier should die in action or put a bullet through his head. That's it. Don't move. I just came to lie down next to you. Thank you. They're coming. The Germans are coming. They're coming. The Germans are coming. They're all in green. I saw them from the window. One of them said hello to me. Fool that IT am, I answered him. 1 saw others on foot, on motorcycles. The tank drivers are in black and red. -They said hello to me, too. -So you answered them? Yes. I climbed out of the window to warn you. -They're coming here? -No idea, but we've got to clear out. -We swore to defend our island. -It's a whole army. We've got to split. Go ahead and be free men, if you like. You'd better decide now. Fast. I'm scared stiff, but I'll stay. After the death of Mellie's fiancé, Bertrand changed. -We're going. -We're staying. I said we're going. Let's go. -But we took that vow. -That was just for fun. Robinson, come. Maité, take the binoculars and get up in the tree. Maité had become aware of her despair and decided to fight to the bitter end. So once again she became what she'd been all along:... a dream, a shelved fiancée, a mock widow. I've got the bangers. -We've got to hurry. -If they see the dummies, they'll shoot. -Give us a hand. -We'll answer their fire. -No, you won't. I'm responsible for you. -I'm responsible for myself. -If anything happens, your mother... -Don't talk about my mother. -What about Mellie. -She'll understand. -She and I aren't yellowbellies. -You're mad. I don't give a damn what you think. And don't tell your uncle on us. I'll do whatever I want to do. Go and get more. Hurry! Thanks. Zigomar got them for the 14th of July. I've tried them out. One explosion makes as much noise as an army rifle. Just imagine the racket when we light them all in one shot. The German tanks. They're here. Maité, do you see them? No, they're taking the highway. -Oh, there. I see them. -How many are there? Seven. No, now more of them are coming. In armored cars. -I see soldiers wearing goggles. -Where are they going? -They're still on the highway. -Happy now, yellowbelly? -Your chances are getting better. -No... Boys, look. They're coming. Get in position. Robinson, to the left. Zigomar, to the right. Let's go. Look, they've spotted us. What kind of crap is that? Lieutenant, they're not moving either. You see? And the helmets! What's this force at all? No idea. But they're hiding low. You've got to have guts to poke fun at our army days before the armistice. What do we do now? Shall we break through their barricade? Forward, march... -Do you think it'll work? -I hope so. -What are they doing? -Retreating. We sure scared them. What do we do now, Lieutenant? Don't you notice anything? Listen closely, Werner. Maybe next time we'll hear chimes. -Phase three of the operation. -What is he talking about? We regroup to defend the barricade. The last pocket of resistance. Do you like it? Kids playing games? Ridiculous. And a waste of time to boot. I'm past that age. Karl, I want you to fire into those bushes. About two meters up. They're on their bellies. The shots will go over their heads. And shoot down those straw dummies. Those lads will be very proud later on. But... These youngsters... are making a stand. It's an honor we must reciprocate. Fire. Did you see that? Shit, a hole. They have no right to fire on kids. Congratulations. You gave us quite a fright. But now I order you to clear out and leave the fighting to the grownups. -Here we go. -Don't be stupid, Bertrand. It's over. -We've done all we could. -You, maybe, but not me. -You're crazy, Bertrand. -Don't go. I must. Are you hoping for negotiations? Is that it? Brave. The helmets are excellent. As is the flag. Your dummies were also very effective. It's good to want to defend oneself. Don't shoot. They're just children. I'm Lieutenant von Pickendorf of the 3rd Armored Division of Westphalia. 1 give you one last chance to retreat with your weapons and flag intact. Does that von Pickendorf think I'm just a kid playing games? My name is Bertrand Carré. I do not give you permission to cross my land. -Think he'll talk about his dad? -They'll like that dancer bit. 1 come in friendship. I'm very glad to have run into you. You wanted to stop the German army. I think I can understand why. I will remember you for a long time. And you as well, Mademoiselle. I'm Maité de Réfort. I also belong to Bertrand Carré. Interesting. -You have two minutes to clear out. -Robinson, my rifle. I surrender. I'm 14 years old. I don't want to die. Kuntz, get the flag. -What does the flag represent? -Chance. He wanted to uphold honor. He succeeded. Monsieur... Lieutenant Franz von Pickendorf. 1 express my sincere condolences. I'm very sorry. It was a tragic misunderstanding. Is there anything I can do? Yes. Get off my property. What's going on? Bertrand... Bertrand, talk to me! Bertrand, it's me. It's me. -Bertrand, talk to me. -Stop it, Mellie. Don't leave me. We've got to do something, Papa. -There's nothing we can do, Mellie. -This just can't be. You died a hero, just as you always wanted. Now I am alone. That's not true, Maité. We're still here. She's right. It'll never be the same again. Bertrand experienced love before he died. You gave him a wonderful gift. You loved him, and he knew it. Hold on to the memory of his youth. Try not to forget it. One remembers the important things forever. That's the way it should be. When you love someone, he never dies. Ten years later, while on a trip in France with his wife... Franz decided to make a detour and took the path through the fields. He wanted to see that island again. I'll be right back. Ten years. Ten years ago, there was war. Franz had killed Bertrand Carré in action, as had been the boy's wish. Franz had realized that right from the start. Nothing about it had been dishonorable. Three characters took part in that drama, and despite its dark sides... it upheld the dignity of each of them. -Children, let's go. -We're coming, Mama. "Here lies Bertrand Carré... "who died a hero's death at the age of 14."
