My name is Kenji. This could be me three hours from now. Why do I want to kill myself? I don't know... I wouldn't kill myself forthe same reasons as other suicidal people. Money problems... Broken heart... Hopelessness... No, not me. Many books say "Death is relaxing." Did you know that? No need to follow the latest trends... No need to keep pace with the rest of the world... No more e-mail... No more telephone... It'll be like taking a nap... Before waking up refreshed and ready to begin your next life. That's what they say. This is bliss. Surprised! Present. But don't open it, it's mine. Nice place... big... Not bad. Sorry I didn't warn you I was coming. I had a bit of an emergency. Got any ice? You don't have a TV? How can you live without a TV? You can't just read, you'll go crazy. I can buy you a TV, and DVD too. It's fucking hot! Is the traffic in Bangkok always this bad? Took me almost two hours to get here. Can't believe you don't have a TV! Suicide again? Hanging yourself this time? It's too hot! I need a shower. This heat can kill you. Why bother with suicide? "Black Lizard", by Yukio Mishima Out jogging. Don't answer the phone. This is bliss. Kenji, Tea is getting cold. Thank you. I got to find a way to go back to Japan. If not Japan, maybe Brazil. Japan is better, fuck overseas. But here you have a brother. Yeah, the crazy one. He reads too much. You can't go back to Japan. Boss will kill you. But I've been with him a long time. He's just in a bad mood. A bad mood? Yes. You fucked his daughter! If you fucked my daughter, I'd cut your dick off and stuff it in your mouth! Really? You've seen too many yakuza movies. Kenji. Ready to go home? Yes. Kenji. This is the form for the public. This one is for staff. Sorry. Thank you very much. Kenji. I'm making sushi at home tonight. Are you free? I'm allergic to fish. Sorry. Thank you very much. Nid? Have you seen Nid? She's somewhere here. Nid! Nid! What? Let's go home. I can't. Let's go home. My client's still here. I have to talk to you. About what? "The Last Lizard" Are you Japanese? Are you from Japan? Japan... Japan... Japanese... speak? Stop fucking with the radio. Nid... stop it! Are you crazy? Take your headphones off. What the fuck... Did you fuck Jon? Who told you that? Did you fuck him? Jon told me everything today. What? What did that dickhead tell you? Yeah, he's a dickhead. He's shit! So why did you have to go fuck a shit like that? You couldn't leave him alone because he's my shit, right? Jon's such a dickhead. Don't know why you care so much about him. I... know... Japanese. I... Japanese... Getting off here? Listen, Jon started it, not me. That's not the point. The point is you're my sister. He's probably got his dick in some other bitch's pussy right now. Get out! Out! "The lizard wakes up and finds he's the last lizard alive. His family and friends are all gone. Those he didn't like, those who picked on him in school, are also gone. The lizard is all alone. He misses his family and friends. Even his enemies. It's better being with your enemies than being alone. That's what he thought. Staring at the sunset, he thinks. "What is the point in living... If I don't have anyone to talk to?" But even that thought doesn't mean anything... when you're the last lizard." Nid! Your car is in the parking lot out front. You know my crazy brother. Make yourself at home. We have a lot to catch up on, Buddy. Ice, ice, ice! Is this a house or a library? Damn... no ashtray. Cool place. You moved here for girls? Or boys? Thanks... l'll wait till it's cold. Damn it! No! No! Don't kill me! - Kenji, aren't you going home? - Yes. This is your bag? The cop thought it's mine. He took it into my carthen. I've found your card inside. So I came here to give it back. Kenji, are you coming? You go first. Did you see a book? What book? No. Nothing. Are you okay? I gotta go. Yes, me too. Thank you for dinner. Thank you. You go home now? I'm not sure. You go karaoke? I cannot sing. You go for girl? Can I go to your house? My home... very far. Good.

I'm scared... I don't want to be alone. Hey, did you see a Japanese guy? What are you doing? I'm sorry. I bought you some sushi. Sushi? Fucking expensive. I'm sorry. Okay, I know you're sorry. I cannot eat fish. I get sick... You don't speak much Thai, right? Thank you. What can you say? Good luck. Some more? I don't want. Thank you. I thought you didn't want any more. More Thai. Too expensive. I'm full. Then stop eating. Never mind. No problem. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5... 5... 5 You are very pretty. More. Thank you. You say that a lot, huh. I'm studying Japanese. Really?
