To my father, lluis danés. Victim of COVID-19. Based on real facts. Kidnapper of children. Witch. - Blood. - Sorceress. Blood. Satan's whore. Bad woman. Demon. - Blood. - Boodsucking ogre. Killer. A hyena. A human beast. Will you take much longer to die, demon witch? Blood. A heartless monster. Without guts. The Barcelona vampiress. Enriqueta marti has died. The nuns have killed her. A few months earlier. Yes, right. He said that. Yes, of course. Look who's here. Is he out of the asylum already? Asylum? I thought he'd quit the job. They say he tried to kill his father. He must be crazy, then. Hey, comas! Come over here. What's up? You're writing again? Apparently so. Could you tell me what they will talk to us about? You don't know? No, no. I just got here. I've been... Traveling. Little girls missing. That's the topic. We'll see what lie they've got in store for us today. Gentlemen. If you will allow me, I will read to you the note sent to me by the city's governor: "Alarming rumours have been spreading through Barcelona the past few days about the mysterious disappearance of several young children. These rumors have caused alarm and fear in many families in Barcelona. It is not true that corpses of children have been found in the outskirts. It is not true that several children have disappeared... What about teresita guitart? Teresita guitart is an isolated case. In any case, we have solid leads, which we are following and will soon find out more. - Commissioner! - Commissioner! "The truth is that most reports on child abduction have been found out to be motivated by lawsuits between broken marriages". There will not be any more questions. Mr comissioner one more question. There will not be any more questions. There's nothing more we can say at this time. They take us for fools. So, what do we write now? Same thing we wrote yesterday: Teresita guitart is still missing. And that the police don't even know where to start looking. How long ago did she go missing? Two weeks. She was on the street with her mother on carnival day. The mother stopped to talk to a neighbour and then suddenly... We write about this case because everyone knows teresita's parents. They have a name and a last name. But what about the children in the streets, huh? The ones who go missing every day? No one talks about them. Are there really that many? The orphanage is packed with kids. And the streets too. They're the children of prostitutes, or couples that don't want them anymore. It seems like the lives of these children have no value to anyone. People say there's a red wagon that drives through Barcelona at night that snatches up all the lost children from the streets and takes them to an unknown place, where they take their hearts and guts. They call it the bloody wagon. Little girls missing. That's the topic. Alarming rumors have been spreading through Barcelona the past few days about the mysterious disappearance of several young children. The orphanage is packed with kids. And the streets too. They're the children of prostitutes, or couples that don't want them anymore. It doesn't seem like the lives of these children have any value at all. Teresita guitart is an isolated case. I want to go with mum. Mum! It's finally here! From the heights, we have here today with us: Vanessa, the Saint. Saint! To you, the devotees of bad habits, who got me into what I shouldn't? If I lose my decorum for being generous, I owe it to the friar and the gold sultan. I lend my modesty at your mercy. Among the waters, I quench my thirst. You still remember. I remember other things too. How long has it been since you last came to see me? Like a year? And have you missed me? If you want to hear it, I can say I did. I'd like it, if it was true. Why don't you quit once and for all and find a nice job? You want me to stop being a whore? You should know, you're not the first one to ask me this. Yeah, I can imagine. And actually, I've almost quit. What does almost mean? I only see one gentleman now. Well, and now you too. But I've decided to change my life. And who will you choose? Me or the other one? Neither of you. I want to be my own boss. Have I already told you that I'll sing at the opera house? It's a contest. For opera singing. I'm having a beautiful dress made. I've been saving for months to pay for it. And what do you sing? La Donna é mobile. Go ahead and laugh, but I know I can do it. If you sing naked, you'll win for sure. I can do it and I will. I refuse to become one of those toothless whores that suck you off in the street for ten cents. Amelia... I'll change my life. I'll sing and I'll move to Italy. Amelia, come here. I'm sorry, you hear me? Why don't you stay for the night, huh? Come on. I can't. I have to get up early tomorrow. Come on, just tonight. I have singing lessons tomorrow and afterwards I'll have to go see the dressmaker. Since when do you shoot up? I have trouble sleeping. You also did before and you didn't shoot up. I know, but it's gotten worse. You haven't told me what you've been doing all these months away. Why do you want to know? Well, I tell you everything. I'll tell you some other day. Do whatever you want. I will. I'll tell you some other time. Sweet dreams. Help me! Laura? Help! Help me! Laura, Laura! No, Laura! Laura! Good morning! Good, huh? Yeah, I guess so. It's just that I don't really like writing about missing girls. Well, you have no other choice. That's the story these days. You could interview the parents. Couldn't you give me something else? What do you mean "something else"? What's wrong with you? I held your job for a year. I thought you were fine by now. I am, I am. Well, you don't look like it. Is it about Laura? Help me! Did I say something about Laura? Am I right or not? Yes, I dreamt about her. Come on, sebastia, it's been years now. Stop it, uncle. Stop it. I've had enough for today. Hold on, sebastia. Hold on. Listen, sebastia. You're a good journalist, one of the best. Don't destroy your life. Will you interview the guitarts? Why has no one written anything? Don't touch me. Don't! Don't touch me! The baker's daughter goes missing and everyone gets all worked up. But mine... don't touch me! Who will help me find my daughter? Who? Claudia, her name is Claudia. She's ten. I went to the shelter because I know that sometimes the police will take kids they find in the streets to the nuns, but I didn't find her. And I spent all my money going to France, to the glass factory in Saint denis. Someone told me they have Spanish children working there. Is that true? I saw some, yeah. But I didn't find my daughter. And if I'd known then what I know now, I wouldn't have bothered with the trip. What do you mean? What do you know? There are very bad people in this city, Mr. Comas. People who pay whatever the cost to satisfy their vices. They don't believe in god, they believe in nothing. They only enjoy harming others. There are places where they take the children and these snakes do whatever they want to them. But no one will listen to me. And I can't do anything on my own. I can't even get close. Why not? What have you done? Look at me. Do you expect them to let me in? Come, quickly. Come hide. Wait, wait. Be careful. First time here? Excuse me? That I see you in my house. Vila, carles vila. A pleasure. By the way, who told you about us? A friend. A good friend, I hope. Would you mind telling me his name? Just to thank him. Mr. Salvat. The lawyer. A good client. I believe he's here tonight. I'll talk to him later. No need Mr. Vila, come with me. We have women for all tastes. Mysterious, dangerous, for the brave ones, for the shy ones. We have every kind. Do you want one? Do you want all of them? Tell me how can we please you. I'll introduce you to Marlene. She has no inhibitions. Marlene! No, no. Tell me, what do you want? What I want is a child. A little girl. That's the most expensive. How much? 70 pesetas. Fine. I can afford it. If you don't mind. Look, what a little Princess I have for you. Her name is Rosita. Where are the others? Excuse me? - What did she put on you? - What are you doing? Leave the girl alone. - This crap on her mouth. - Leave the girl alone! - Where are the others? - Leave the girl alone! - Where are the others? - Leave the... Where are they?! Leave the girl alone! Where are the others? Teresita! Claudia! The girl! Mum! Come. We have to go to the police. - Let's leave this place. - We have to go to the police. What the hell happened to you? It's nothing. Read it. - Read it. - "Child trafficking in Barcelona". Let's see. Brothels, corruption of minors, with possible implication of known people. You want me to publish this? Last night I went to the brothel on valldonzella street. I went with that man who came to see us, fuster, the one looking for his daughter. And you got in a fight and got your face busted open. I went to the brothel, I asked for a little girl and they brought me one. You must have talked to the police then, right? Of course, absolutely. - And? - Nothing. They searched the place, but found nothing. Then, what do we have? We filed a complaint. Mrs. Leonor, the madam who runs the brothel, will have to testify before a judge. I can't publish this. What? Why not? If we make enough noise, we can get them to shut down the brothel forever. Do you know who was there as a client? No. And I don't want to know. Your friend, the famous lawyer andreu salvat. So what? You want to condemn him for whoring around? I'm telling you there were little girls there, some very young. It's impossible he didn't know that little girls... Listen to me, listen. We will not accuse anyone of child trafficking if we have no proof. Alright? This is the deal. Come in. - Excuse me, Mr. Méndez. - Yes? It's teresita guitart, they found her. And she's alive. Thank you. Listen to me, forget about the whorehouses and brothels and go check what happened. The girls are fine. They were given medical check-ups and there were no signs of mistreatment or abuse. And where were they found? In an apartment on ponent street. We got a call from the neighbour. And who is the other girl? Angelita. The kidnapper says it's her daughter, but she could be another kidnapped girl. Did you say her? Is it a woman? Enriqueta marti ripoll. Thirty-five years old. According to her neighbours she's grumpy, serious, unfriendly, strange. She's a beggar, a whore and a healer. She denies kidnapping the girl, but after interrogating her, I see her capable of terrible crimes. She's got evil in her eyes. Killer! Whore! Hang her! Killer! Killer! My apologies for this mess, gifts keep coming in for teresita. May I? Of course, do it. Hello teresita. My name is sebastia. Do you mind if I ask you some questions? How did you end up with Mrs. Enriqueta? It was the kitten's fault. How's your husband? The doctor came yesterday. Tuberculosis. Poor man. I don't know how I'll make it on my own. Teresita, go tell your father I'll be right there. And how are you? It's a lot of money... The house, the kids... I'm so worried. I don't know what I'll do, if you could help me. And... Was she nice to you, Mrs. Enriqueta? She would hit me sometimes. And her daughter too. Angelita would hit you? Yes. She said if I didn't behave, her mother would rip out my heart, like she did to pepito. So, what do you mean? There was another child in the apartment? I never saw him because they'd already killed him. Kid. Look, I made them. Do you like them? One is for you. Look. Do you know what that stain is? That's pepito's blood, the boy who came to play with me before you. Look, and that's his heart in there. My mother ripped it out. Help! Help! Someone help me! Please! If you misbehave, the same will happen to you. My mother is a witch. A witch? She said that? Yes. And that she'd rip my heart out. Sebastia! Come. Sebastia comas, my nephew and protégé. He's currently covering teresita's case for the paper. Ah, yes. I've read it. Mr. Salvat, lawyer. He's one of the patrons of this gala. Well, and many other cultural events in Barcelona. Yes, sure. I know him. And what are your thoughts on the changes the city is undergoing? Well, I believe we're building a modern and beautiful city, despite the extravagancies of our architects. Gaudi's work looks like an easter egg. And the hospital district? Well, I don't know what to tell you. I don't know the neighbourhood. And you? Have you never been in the neighbourhood? Nevel but I've been told it's turning into a revolting spectacle. Do you really not know the district? Are you questioning my word? No, it's just a figure of speech. I would recommend you to take a walk along those streets. What people say is nothing compared to what one can see there. Should we go inside? The show is about to start. "Barcelona pays homage to teresita, the kidnapped girl, with the projection of the verb to love". "If only this passion was a dream". "Queen in my kingdom you shall be". "And in my love you shall always reign". "The precious girl climbed on the stage and waved at the audience". "And the prestigious lawyer Mr. Salvat gifted her a valuable donation". "The audience applauded with sincere enthusiasm". Only for two cents. Today, two sessions of illusionism, phantasmagorias and marvelous fountains. You! Who dares to get in and speak with ghosts? Turn her! Turn her! Sebasfia. Not now. Sebasfia. Not now, uncle. Mr. Fuster is here. He wants to speak with you. Come on. Would you come with me to the morgue? Her body was tossed into the sea, she didn't drown. It's not her. Thank god. My daughter is alive. She's alive. My daughter is alive. My daughter is alive. Comas, have I told you that her heart was ripped out? Help me. Help me. Help me, help me. Help me. Help me. Help me. Help me. Don't leave me! Sebastia. Laura! Laura? No! Leave me alone! Laura! Go away! Help me. Don't leave me! Don't leave me! Come here. Can I help you with something? No, no. Thank you. I'm fine. It's just that I don't sleep much. That's not good. You have to rest, comas. Yes, I know. Did you notice this girl? Her hair was also cut. Like teresita guitart. That means she also comes from a poor family. A year ago, in a town in almeria, a healer kidnapped a boy and killed him. He confessed that he wanted the blood to make a cure for tuberculosis. He slaughtered him like a pig. Do you really think that enriqueta marti is guilty of killing this child? She's a healer. And if what angelita says is true, it wouldn't be the first time she's ripped out a child's heart. And her? What does she say? Enriqueta. Have you interrogated her? Has she told you why she kidnapped teresita? Every time she talks to the judge she tells the same story. She found her lost and took pity of her. You know what? I can't stop thinking about it. Could the disappearances of children be related to the brothel? Are you investigating that? There's nothing to investigate. Nothing? Nothing? I was offered a six year old girl. Six. And there were others even younger. A whore is a whore, at six or at forty. I beg to differ. Because you don't know the neighbourhood like I do. These girls are put into whoring by their own mothers. And anyway, the brothel will remain closed during the hearings. The judge will ask for the madam when he sees fit, and for you as well. Fine. And then you'll get the chance to explain everything you've seen. But then, comas, everything will remain the same. Nothing will change, the brothel will open again. Because this is the way things work in this district. Sure. Comas. We're going to search the kidnapper's apartment today. You didn't search it when you found teresita? We didn't think about it then, but now there's a dead girl. Things change. Do you want to come along? Can I? No. No, you can't. But if I let you in, no one will challenge me. Do you know the brothel on valldonzella street? Everyone knows it. Have you ever worked there? No. I'm my own boss, you know that. What's wrong? It's nothing. I went there a few days ago. They offered me a little girl. I don't know. Do you want to see my new dress? No one has seen it yet. Do you know anyone who has worked at the brothel? I need... I need a witness, someone to corroborate that Mrs. Leonor has little girls there. - What do you think? - Have you heard about the bloody wagon? Are you here to see me? Or what the fuck are you doing here? Don't get mad. I'll get mad if I want to. I don't know. The dress is very pretty. Go away. Leave. There's something here. Looks like girl's hair. Commissioner! We found this. And what the hell are you waiting for? Do I have to do it myself? Mother of god. After the search, the judge immediately asked for a forensic report of the bones and the hair, as well as of several ointments found in the apartment of enriqueta marti. The ointments? Why? There are reasons to believe that these ointments could be made of human fat. How many murders are we talking about? With the amount of evidence found, we suspect that the accused, enriqueta marti, managed to kidnap and kill over half a dozen children. Sebastia. Sebastia. Sebasfia. It's too late to be sleeping. It's time to work. Come on, get dressed. All the papers today published about yesterday's press conference. All but ours. How are we supposed to sell papers like this? I'm very sorry. I couldn't finish the article. Why? Who cares, don't tell me. Well, I can see the topic is affecting you, so that's enough of that. I want you to write something about the construction in the city. Is there no ventilation in this room? I want to interview the kidnapper. You didn't want to talk about missing girls and now you want to interview that woman? Wouldn't you like to be the first one to publish her photography? With this, I can make it up to you for yesterday. Alright. Try it. I don't know how you can live like this. My angel, I'll never leave your side. Sleep, little girl, tonight. Mom is here now. The moon came out. Are you sure you want to go in? Enriqueta marti? This is sebastia comas, a journalist. What do you want? Will you take me out of here? No. I can't do that. Then what the fuck do you want? I want to know why you kidnapped teresita guitart. I did not kidnap her. Look, mom. Mom, look. A girl. Hey. Hey. Are you lost? Are you hungry? Yes. Yes? Come on. We'll give you some food and we'll go look for your mother afterwards, huh? Okay? If teresita was lost, why didn't you take her to the police? I thought they'd take her to the nuns. The nuns are bad. But you cut her hair. And changed her name. I did. It's a beautiful name, isn't it? Yes. Felicity. It's nicer than Teresa. If I'd had another daughter, I would have named her... Felicity. And all the blood-stained rags that the police found at your home? The blood is mine. I bleed a lot down there. I'm sick. And the other kid? Who? Where is he? Angelita says that before teresita, there was another child at you home. Angelita doesn't like to be alone. Pepito often comes around to be with her. Well, your daughter says you killed him. She makes up stories. She has a big fantasy life. Pepito lives in sabadell with his mother. I already told the judge and the police, and I don't know why they haven't looked for him. They have to look for him! And the girl who was found in the harbour? Yes. I killed that one too. And twenty other children! It's a lie! It's a lie! It's a lie. I can hear what people shout on the streets from here. I hear the boy who tells the news and the terrible things that are said about me. It's a lie. You'd like to take a picture of me, right? Yes? I'd like to, yes. Take it. Take it. Take it. But first you have to promise me you'll look for pepito. Pepito. He lives in sabadell with his mother. You'll look for pepita's house. It's in rec street. The most beautiful house in the street. The newest. It has a rooster on the door. This way everyone will know that pepito is alive and that I'm not a murderer. Do you promise me? I promise you. What were you doing at the brothel in valldonzella street? When? No, no. I haven't been in the brothels for years now. Yes. I was there. I saw you. I saw how you gave something to Mrs. Leonor. It was a cure. She's been buying from me for a while now, for herself and her clients. A cure for what? A cure for everything. Do you want to know what my remedies are made of? Of blood, fat and bone marrow of babies! Sister! You have a secret. I see it in your eyes. A secret that makes you suffer, isn't it? Sister! Sister! The visit is over. Don't leave! No, no, don't leave. Don't leave! Will you go see my daughter? If you do, bring her chocolate. And tell her I miss her a lot. Your daughter is going to a host family. You'll never see her again. Sister! Sister! No! You can't take her from me! Not my daughter. Sister! Sister! Enriqueta! Enriqueta, stop! Quickly, sister. Open the door. Open it! Quickly! Open it! Hello, angelita. My name is sebastia, I'm a journalist. Can I sit? I went to see your mother this morning. She's worried about you. She really misses you. You don't care that she misses you? I don't know. Lots of ladies come here to see me. And they all say they're my mother and that they miss me. I bet those ladies don't know you as well as enriqueta does. I don't know. She told me you like chocolate. Thank you. Teresita was also wearing a medallion like these. This is teresita's one. She gave it back to me. Do you want it? Would you like to tell me something about teresita? That girl is an idiot. We're home. Stand up. You're hurting me. And I'll keep on doing it if you don't stay still. I want to go home. I want my mom. I told you to shut up. Shut up! What's going on, mom? Get me a knife. No! No! No! Hey! Come here. Please, do not hurt me. If you stay still, I won't hurt you. From now on, I'll be your mother. Huh? Your name is not teresita anymore. Now your name is: Felicity. You're not my mother. What's your name? Teresita. What's your name? Felicity. That's how I like it. Felicity. It's fine, Felicity. No one can know you are here. Mom! Shut up! Mom. Mom is here. It's okay. It's okay. You'll look really nice. Won't she, angelita? Tell her that she'll look very pretty. You will look very pretty. - No - shut up! Enough. Stop. That's enough crying. That's. Enough. Crying. Enough! Enough. Or else, I'll lock you in a really dark room. Your mother says that you made up all that stuff about pepito. I say she killed him on the kitchen table. Don't leave me. Help me. Help me. Help me. Breaking news! Breaking news! At last we can see the killer's face. Read about the crimes of this wicked woman. Enriqueta marti is the vampiress of Barcelona. A woman so thirsty for blood that sucks on her own veins. Breaking news! Breaking news! We'll all have a toast. Can we talk? We're celebrating. We sold out two editions, and the presses are back on. Vampiress? "She was so thirsty for blood that she bit her own veins". This is not what I wrote. I wanted to add some passion. Couldn't we have waited for the judge's sentence to add some passion? People like morbid. This is what they like. I don't understand why you're so concerned about this. That woman is a killer. Is she? Who says it? Police. Forensics. Her own daughter claims that she saw her kill a kid on the kitchen table. You wrote it yourself. I wrote that I have some doubts. And that more than a killer, that woman seems to be mentally ill, crazy or hysterical, but this is not in the article. Where are you going? Don't leave me hanging, goddamnit! Listen to me. This is about selling. Selling, selling and selling. Do you understand? I have to go to court. Fine. But I want you to go back to prison. Talk to her as much as you can. Let her explain her life story, have her talk about whatever. Let's ride this wave. I'll go back. But not because you're asking. I made a promise. A promise? What promise? Mr. Comas? I'm glad to inform you that there will be no trial. As far as I know, the judge hasn't released a statement yet. I haven't even declared yet. It will always be my word against yours. You have no proof. And I keep complete control on who all my clients are. And that registry, guarantees there will be no trial. I won't give up. I know perfectly what I saw. Don't bother. And if you want to see more, you can always come to my house. I am not resentful. It's a contest for opera singing. Fifth edition. Singing contest. Great liceu theatre. This isn't that whore? A whore that sings. A whore! Enough. Amelia. Amelia, Amelia! Wait! What do you want? That was beautiful. I didn't know you could sing like that. That's me. The singing whore. That's right. Forgive me! Forgive me. I haven't... I haven't slept in days. At first, morphine helped... It helped me rest, but not now... I can't stop thinking about my sister. I think about her, dream about her. I see her everywhere. And she looks at me. And talks to me, as if she could still... As if she could still talk to me, as if she could look at me. She's been dead for twenty years. Don't leave me alone tonight. Please. My sister killed herself. Because my dad abused her. She'd asked me to not leave. Not to leave her alone with him. And I left. And left her alone. That's why she killed herself. But how can you be so sure, if you weren't there? My father confessed to me. Right before he died. Was that when you disappeared? I went mad. I tried to kill him. He was dying. And I tried to kill him. Ladies and gentleman, the train to sabadell is about to depart. Sebastia comas, journalist. Excuse me for showing up without warning. I would like to ask you some questions about enriqueta marti. You know her, right? I have nothing to say. Mrs. Subirats. I only need to know if it is true that enriqueta was taking care of your son, short before the carnival festivities. Mrs. Subirats. Where is your son? Can I see him? Go away. Enriqueta could end up being executed! Mrs. Subirats! No! Please. Please. Don't leave. That's why you wanted to talk to me, you bastard? I'm not a witch, you piece of shit. I don't kill children. - I'm not a vampiress. - Sister, the door! No! No! Don't leave. Please don't leave. I couldn't talk to pepita. In fact, she didn't even want to open the door. Who's gonna say they know the witch now, huh? And pepito? Is he alive? Did you see him? I didn't see him. I did not kill him. Look me in the eyes. My hands are not stained by blood. How could I hurt them if... If kids make me feel alive. I did get to see angelita. My daughter. How is she doing? Fine. Does she miss me? Yes, a lot. Don't worry about her, she is well cared for. I miss her so much. She's the only good thing that ever happened to me. I didn't give birth to angelita, but I raised her all the same. What did you say? Angelita is not your daughter? She's my sister-in-law's. But why didn't you tell me that before? If your sister-in-law can confirm this and we can corroborate this we might... No one wants to help me. Not my husband, not my sister-in-law. Not even pepita. I will be executed. What a terrible loneliness, right? Please, make me another favour. Of course. I don't have clean clothes. And blood, I need blood. I'm emptying out completely. I need blood. She needs a doctor and a lawyer. No lawyer wants to represent her. Why not? Because she has no possible defense. Nothing against her is proved. Nothing! Comas! Open you eyes once and for all. This Satan's whore has a spell on you. Look. I really shouldn't do this. But here, have this! All yours. Read it. Witnesses, medical reports, statements. Read it and you'll see who enriqueta marti really is. And tomorrow you'll come with me to another search. Where? The judge ordered searches on enriqueta's former residences. But this time I'll have to invite all the press. Your colleagues are complaining that I'm playing favourites with you. We executed a complete gynaecological check-up on her. And the diagnosis couldn't be clearer. This woman has uterine cancer. And according to my colleague's opinions and mine, she has never had children. Enriqueta has never had chilldren. Angelita is my daughter. And that filthy witch enriqueta took her. I looked out of the window when I heard the child crying. But it wasn't angelita who was crying. The one crying was the other one, the one she had kidnapped. And she asked me: “Do you want me to pick her up so you can rest?”. And I said yes because I was really tired. But she took her away. She took my child. She wouldn't stop crying. That's why I talked to the police. She's crazy. Absolutely crazy. Enriqueta marti is a case of invincible perversity. A natural born criminal. She's a witch. And evil like a demon. Police report. You know them? What are you talking about? You know them. You know enriqueta and Mrs. Leonor. Why don't you drop it? Didn't we have a great time the other day? I read the police reports. You reported enriqueta for corruption of minors. Shut up. You even lived with her for three months. Don't you get that I'm trying to leave all this shit behind? You could've... You could've helped me. You could've talked to the judge and told him everything you know about the brothel. I don't want to talk about the brothel. I don't want to talk about it! And not about enriqueta, not about leonor. Why are you bringing up all the shit I'm trying to forget? Because... I think about my father. And I think about my sister. And I think about the child at the harbour. And I need to sleep. Leave me the fuck alone. Leave her alone. I need to talk to her. She doesn't want to talk to you. And if Amelia doesn't want to talk to you, I can't let you do it. And if you ever bother her again, I swear I'll pull your eyes out. They are all pieces of shit. If you find anything, you put it inside the box and pull the rope. Got it? Come on. Keep going. Get him out. Get him out! No one will deny her acts anymore. This blood thirsty beast, this evil monster. Never. Never. She could've never been a mother. Never. A donation, sirs? A donation? Mercy, sir. Have mercy. Fuster? Fuster, is that you? Sebastia comas, the great reporter. Can I help you get somewhere? Every day I go see the judge to try and find out where my daughter is. Every day. Every day. And no one listens to me. No one. Keep your money. Keep it. I thought you would get to the bottom of all this. That you would tell everything about these people and this brothel. I witnessed the police searches. That was an actual cemetery. It was terrible. Enriqueta marti is guilty. Alright, maybe she is. Or maybe not. She's not the only guilty person in this story and you know that as well as I do. Enoughlenough! It's not that easy, you know? I'm all alone, I can't prove anything! I lost everything. And no one, no one can reproach me anything. No one! And you less than anyone. Less! The truth. You only had to tell the truth. But truth is bitter. The truth? The truth? Who gives a fuck about the truth? Well then, that's it. We can close the story. Once the trial begins we'll pick it back. But we'll let someone else write it. - Hello. Mr. Comas? - Rest for a day or two. And then you'll get started on the anarchist affair. You can use everything I say, but I beg you, please never publish my name or tell it to anyone. Alright? Alright. If you do it, my life and my children's life will be at risk. Of course. A child? A child, yes. I'm asking you for a child. It's a client's request. It's not that uncommon. I don't know. I don't think I can do this. You can't do it? Neither of you can do it? Take a good look at yourselves. You're getting old. Clients want young girls. And someone has to give them what they want. What do you want? Don't you see I'm doing you a favour? Do you want to be like those toothless whores giving blowjobs on the street for ten cents? Do you want to die from syphilis in an asylum? Do you want to die in the streets? Or rot in jail? Come on. Come on! You're constantly surrounded by children. Let's see, pepita. How many children do you have? Can you feed them all? Leave my children alone. What about your angelita? Not my daughter. Then look in the streets, they are full with abandoned children. I don't know if enriqueta did it. But I do know she is not a murderer. I know this for sure and I can swear on it. She took care of my son many times, and she was always sweet to him. My son loves her a lot. And angelita too. You! Pretty face! Who are you coming to see? Is she the girl from the harbour? Yes. No one came for her body. And I can't have her here any longer. Where are they taking her? To the medical school, I guess. I don't really know. You have everything in here. What do you want to know? Is it possible you made a mistake about the bones? Yes. Yes. I was wrong for sure. You can see in which conditions we have to work. I'm tired of saying this. I don't have a lab. I have no assignations. I'm missing appliances and analysis tools. But you signed the stance the judge has. I did. The judge needs a veredict. Quickly. Well, it will take months. I'll rephrase that, doctor. The judge is about to retire but before he does, he wants to close this case. My advice to you, is to not make things any more complicated. This woman is a killer. We all know it. This, for example. Looks likes a piece of femur, right? A child's femur, don't you agree? Yes. I guess. It could be. Then, write the report. Then no one can confirm these are children's bones. Look. This is part of a iamb's skull. A piece of ceramic. This thing here could be a dog bone. And this? It's rabbit skin. About the other stuff I really can't say much. They could be human remains or they could not. But it doesn't really matter. It doesn't matter? If the police and the press say it, I won't be the one who makes everything complicated. That woman is a killer, everyone knows it. And thank god she's already dead. Sure. Sure. I talked to the forensic who examined the remains we found at enriqueta marti's apartment. Not now, sebastia. The police forced him to say those remains were human. What are you telling me, that everyone lied? I'm telling you that we have deliberately accused enriqueta. Who? People who want to cover the brothel issue. Police, salvat the lawyer. Mrs. Leonor and her judge friends, the governor. And we are all accomplices. Our duty is to tell the truth. The only proven crime enriqueta committed was to kidnap teresita. But a dozen killings? Come on, uncle! Goddamnit! No one believes that! Maybe you're right. But we can't publish it. We can make up the vampiress story but we can't say the truth? Listen to me, sebastia. The wounds of the tragic week have not healed yet. And if the idea that some bourgeoisie personalities are involved in the children's issue gets around, it won't just be a scandal, but a popular revolution. Churches would burn again. Bombs would explode, and no one would be safe. Forget about enriqueta. After all, we can do nothing for her now. We can tell the truth, we can get justice. We can Bury the harbour kid. That kid is not your sister. Forget it. Start over. I'm leaving. I'm leaving this place. And this time, I'll write the truth. I'll write the story of enriqueta marti. And I swear I'll find someone willing to publish it. Sebastia. Sebastia! And now, if you have the nerve, go write this shit you write. What happened? No, don't move. What are you doing here? Do you want me to ask for a painkiller? I wanted to say goodbye. A neighbour saw you and took you to the hospital. Take me home. No, you can't move. You won't be able to walk. Bring me my clothes. Sebastia, please. The clothes. Are you really leaving tomorrow? Yes. I'd like to come with you. So, that thing about me quiting as a whore was true. Well, I've never been to Milan. Me neither. Are you comfortable? Yes, Amelia. Amelia, come here. Sit. Sit. Are you going alone? Or do you have a companion? No. I have no companion. Then, let me go with you. Alright. Let's go together. But before that, I have to write one last article. How are you going to write like this? I'll need your help. A hyena. A human monster. A gutless beast. The Barcelona vampiress. We have accused enriqueta marti of some monstruous crimes. But we have seen crimes, where there only was misery and desperation. And we have written the lies that others wanted us to write. The monster wasn't her, the monsters were us. Help us. Help us. It was you. Yes. The harbour girl. It was me. I took her to the brothel. Excuse us for the wait. But it will be worthy. I've been told she's beautiful. Good evening. Good evening. Come in, girls. Hello, darling. Have this. Is it good? I can imagine what happened in that room, but I can't think about what happened afterwards. I don't know who killed her. Or who took her heart out. Or how she ended up in the sea. Is everything done? Yes. Well done. Have this. I also have this for you. Have a nice trip. Thank you. Can I leave now? Good luck. What if she regrets this and tells everything? She will not regret it. Haven't you seen her eyes? She's been crying. Morphine overdose. No doubt about it. So it's a suicide, then. A suicide? He would have left a note. And, do really whores ever commit suicide? Believe me, this is a suicide. Write it on the report. Okay, okay. Whatever you say. Can't you see them? They look like Romeo and Juliet. The vampiress of Barcelona! The monstrous woman who drank her own blood. Come in and see the kidnapper of children! Rocking chair, bad woman. Who kills children to make ointments for beautiful ladies. Oh, rocking chair rocking chair, bad woman. Who kills children to make ointments for beautiful ladies.
