( flies buzzing ) ( helicopter whirring ) ''Eat me.'' ''Blondes Prefer Cucumbers.'' ''Patty Does Panama.'' ''Rub Me Raw.'' What the hell is this? ''The Unsinkable Schecky... Moskowitz.'' The Unsinkable... Schecky Moskowitz. ( upbeat reggae style music begins ) Schecky Moskowitz. Schecky's very ugly. When I speak to him I want to vomit. I was in the elevator with him the other day, and there was a-- a foul smell. He has great concepts about life... but, I wouldn't want him to touch me. ( Caribbean/reggae music playing ) Hey there. I'm Schecky Moskowitz. Thank you. See you later, Mr. Cab Driver. Hey, how are ya? Well, what you're about to see is a fictitious, loosely thrown together story about a sea cruise waiter, me, right here, who dreams of becoming a stand-up comedian. This story in based entirely on the fact that we had access to this nice big boat here, and a lot of good lookin' women. I mean really good lookin' women. Beauty pageant girls. - Hi. - Hola. - Hi. - Hi. - Hello. - Hello. G'day. Unbelievable. Beautiful. Very clean women. Oh, oh, yeah. I wanted to tell ya. Um, this is a ''no budget flick,'' not a ''low budget flick.'' No budget, just like this would be an earthquake right here. ( rumbling sounds - dramatic music plays ) See, that didn't cost us anything right there. Now enjoy the flick. I'll see you later. - ( horn blowing ) - All ashore that's going ashore. All right, here we are on the deck, ready to rock n' roll. Start the picture. I'm here in my waiter suit right now. Oh, shoot! I'll be right back. ( horn blows ) Ah, ha, ha. Now that's better right here. Hey, waiter! - Where's my bloody Mary ? - Ah, yes. - And make it bloody. - Ah, yes, sir. Hey, asshole! ( gulping ) - Bring me another one. - Ah, yes, ma'am. ( flatulence sound ) ( laughing heard ) I'll tell ya, I was doing that with a girl last week, right? She was goin' crazy. She was bitin' my nipples, she was pullin' my chest hairs. Crazy right? Finally I go, ''Hey, this has gotta stop. - I said, ''Hey, mom.'' - ( laughing ) All right, all right. Let me tell you this one. Last Wednesday, right, I'm over at this guy's house. We're playing chess, you know a game of chess? Finally I said, ''Hey, this shit's boring the shit out of me.'' So I took the chess piece, I shoved it in his eye. - I shoved it in his eye. - ( laughing ) I said, ''There's fuckin' chess eyes for ya.'' You know what I'm saying ? ( laughing ) You know what I'm sayin', right? I went swimmin' on the boat the other morning, right? While I'm swimmin', my dick shrivels up. Jesus Christ! My pubic hair had my penis hostage. You know what I'm saying? You know what I'm saying, right? ( continues laughing ) Schecky! Schecky! - Oh, hi, Bob. - What are you doin'? Just listenin' to that guy over there. The guy with the girls drooling all over him? Yeah, Dicky Diamond. That's the ship comedian. Oh. I guess that means you didn't convince the Captain to hire you as ship comedian. I guess that's what ''Get out of my office, you no-talent loser'' meant. - No, I didn't get the job. - Tough break. I'm funnier than that guy, don't you think? I don't know, I haven't heard him. - Wait. - I got this chick, right? She's got a scissors hold like a fuckin' wrestler or somethin'. She's got a scissors hold on my neck, right? I'm choking, I'm fuckin' dyin'. Finally I said, ''Hey, Grandma, take your fuckin' varicose sticks off my neck, will ya?'' ( laughs ) That guy's pretty funny, Scheck. Oh, man, the guy's talkin' about incest. That's not funny. The guy needs help. I could get laughs with that. The guy probably farts on stage, too. Hey, hey, hey. Pull my finger, pull my finger. - ( flatulent sound ) - ( laughing ) All my life I just wanted to get on stage and make people laugh, but nobody gives me a chance around here. I'm funny. I just want them to hear what I got to say. I got certain things I want to talk about, maybe they'd be interested in hearing, you know? Passenger: Hey, waiter! My wife's throwin' up! Quick, get me a towel. Sorry, I'm on break. Hey, how are ya? Didn't see you there. Well, let's see, what happened? Where were we? After I finished cleaning up that lady's vomit, I worked a few more hours then I took a little break, and during that break I wrote a few new jokes and I think they're good. I'm very happy with myself right now. See, what I'm gonna do, I gonna ask Dicky Diamond if I can open for him just one of these nights. - ( knocking ) - What, did you hear that? I'll bet that's my best friend, Bob. - Hey, Schecky. - Hey. Who you talkin' to? I'm talkin' to that camera right there. Oh. So, you ready for work? I am ready for work, but, I was wonderin' before we go, think I can run a few things by you, a few jokes? Just like a little improvisation? You give me your honest opinion. No problem. - I'm all audience. - All right. Here we go. All right. Hey, how you guys doin' out there tonight? - Fine. - Oh, what's your name, pal? Where you from? - Bob from California. - Bob from California. Whoa! Bob from California. - ( laughing ) - Bob from California. Whoo! I can't think of anything funny. Was that part of your act? No. I-- I stink at this. I'm not funny. Not true. I think you're very funny. I think you're funny naturally. As soon as you get up on stage, people are going to laugh. Are you ever goin' to get on a stage? Hopefully, because I'm gonna ask Mr. Dicky Diamond if I can open for him one of these nights. - Really? - Yeah. Oh, we better get out of here because Dicky Diamond's doin' his afternoon set on the deck, so let's go check that out. Right. I'll tell ya. Sometimes it gets really hot, and nothin' moves on your whole body. The only thing that you can possibly move is your middle finger. That's it. ( laughing ) Like, yo. Hey, buddy, right there. I'm sorry, sometimes you get so hot, you're driving your car, you're in a human microwave, you know? you're in your car, you're flippin' off everybody, right? You're pissed off, flippin'. If this was a knife, I'd poke you right in the eye, buddy, you know? I'm driving, finally that's it, I'm way too hot, right? I say, ''I'm goin' to get something to drink.'' I go, I get a six-pack, I'm drinkin', I'm drivin', right? A cop pulls me over he says, ''Are you drinkin'?'' - ''Of course I'm fuckin' drinkin'. - ( audience laughs) It's fuckin' hot!'' - Hey, what's your name? - Bunny Miller. Bunny Miller, is that a Jewish name? Boy, a nice Jewish name like that. So, where did your mother pop you out? - What? - ( audience laughs ) Where did you burst your bag, Bunny, come on? - I'm sorry. - Oh, you're sorry. Bunny come on, it's not a fuckin' genius question here. ( makes a buzzer sound ) You lose, Bun. Guess what? You lose. You know what happens to losers? You get your bathing suit ripped off and shoved up your ass. ( Dicky laughing ) Hey, hey, hey. Why don't you just leave the girl alone, and stick to your comedy? Uh-oh. Mr. Heckler. Mr. Big Man from Hell. The Hell heckler is here, folks. Oh, my God. Look, he's so big. All I'm sayin' is, why don't you lay off the girl. Lay the girl? That's a sick thing, man. That's sick. Right in front of all these people? That's really a sick thing. ( laughs ) Okay, fine. I'm just gonna have to shoot you. ( gunshot - applause ) I'll tell you, there's nothin' heavier that a dead comedian. - ( drum rim shot ) - ( laughter ) Thank you. I was talking to my father the other day on the phone, and he said to me, ''Schecky,'' um, he calls me Schecky, 'cause that's my name and I don't answer to Bob much. ( rim shot ) He said, ''Schecky, I want you to marry a girl with the same beliefs as the family.'' I was kinda like, ''Uh, dad, why should I marry a girl that thinks I'm a schmuck?'' - ( rim shot ) - ( light laughter ) Thank you. Thank you very much. Well, my name is Schecky, my father's name is Schecky. Having the same name as your father, that's very weird. It was all right till my voice changed. My friends would call up and say, ''Hi, is Schecky there?'' My father would say, ''This is Schecky.'' My friends would say, ''Hey Schecky, you were so wasted last night.'' - ( rim shot ) - ( laughter ) All right, now look. On your last tour we sold at least a million T-shirts. A million of 'em. We did a hundred-thousand of the Croaker spiked arm bracelets. But, I still think it would be in your best interest to approve the action doll for your younger audience. For the nine-year-olds, the ten-year-olds. Yeah, but I don't wanna be no fuckin' Barbie doll, Mort. That can't be good for my image, man. Croaker, listen to me, listen to me, baby. - You listening? - I'm listening. Okay, 'cause it doesn't look like you're listening to me. What do I got do, shove my fuckin' ear against your mouth? All right, Croaker, just listen to me. We need the doll. Last April, we trashed four Porches and one Harley Davidson. The hotel that you burned down is suing us. They're suing us! We need the doll! We need it! Why not a poster? Why not a lunch box? Why does it have to be a Barbie doll? It's not a Barbie doll, it's a fuckin' action figure, Croaker. An action figure! It's like a Rambo doll, or like one of those transformer things. It's an action figure, it's macho. It's macho, Croaker. Macho. Croaker, I talked to Saul. Saul says we can make 4O million off it. - Forty million? - Forty million. - Four ''D'' million? - Forty million. Action figure, huh? That's cool, man. That's cool. But make sure it ain't smilin'. Yeah, It's all right. Waiter! You see, these guys have nothin' to do with this flick, but, we threw 'em in for a little variety, whatever that means. May I help you guys? Yeah, drinks all around, man. Bambi, what can I get for you? Um, actually, I have an aerobics class, so, um, I'm gonna take a rain man on that. Oh, God. I mean a rain check. ( laughs ) No problem, babe. Man, oh man. I never get sick of that, man. May I get you a drink? Yeah, get me one of them tropical drinks with like, ah, levels to them and an umbrella and fruit. Well, they come in two flavors. Green or black? - Black. - Can I get you one? - A drink? - Yeah, whatever. Say, you know I used to work as a waiter once. Back before I was a multi-billionaire. Mort: Millionaire, Croaker. Millionaire. Millionaire. It was at one of these rib restaurants, man. and, uh... I was-- It was like-- I'd have to touch all these people's chewed up food, and it would get stuck underneath my fingernails, man, and it would just sit there for days. And it would stink! - ( sarcastic laugh ) - I hated that job, man. - Excuse me. - Excuse me. Can we please have your autograph? All right. Chicks, man. I'll sign autographs for you bitches, man. Just say, ''To Pamie and Liz, you were great last night, Love Croaker.'' All right! Hey, Mort, how do you spell ''great'', man? G-R-E-A-T. All right! Thank you. You in a band or somethin'? Yeah, I'm the lead singer for Yellow Teeth. We had the number one song last week, ''I Wanna Slap Your Cat.'' " I wanna slap your cat. " " That's where it's at. " I'll go get you that drink, all right? Whoa, that guy's fucked in the head right there. I just don't understand it. Why do sleazy guys like that get chicks, you know? Just 'cause they got millions and millions of dollars, it makes me sick. If I had a million dollars... Actually, I'd take a hundred and bury it and hopefully somebody poor would find it. If I had a million dollars... ...I would buy another fur coat. Spend it on clothes. Put it in the bank and think about it. I'd put it in the bank. If I had a million dollars, the first thing I'd buy would be a Mercedes. I'd buy up all the Clearasil, so I could pop everybody's pimples, because they wouldn't be able to get rid of them. Mmm. Pus. ( Reggae music playing ) Hey, there. Hi. Well, I got off work a little early tonight, so, I figured I'd hang out at the bar with my good friend, Bob, here. What these guys are doin' here I really have no idea, but, I really can't know everything, can I? I'll just finish up by tellin' Bob this joke about a farmer. Let's see how he reacts to it, all right? I don't get it, Schecky. The farmer wears the condom for eight years? Explain it to me. Ah... no, I can't explain it to you. I guess I must have told the joke wrong. - Oh. - I got it, man. I thought that joke was really funny. - Really? - Yeah. ( chuckles ) Hey, did I ever tell you that I used to be a waiter once? - You were? - Yeah. It was at this restaurant, man. And I hated that job, man, because, I'd have to touch all these people's chewed up food. Do you know what I would do? I would go into the bathroom during my shift, and I'd do a number two. - Yeah? - And I wouldn't wash my hands. - ( laughing ) - I think that's illegal, man. - Hi, Croaker. - Hey, babe. - Hey, who's the other babe? - This is my friend, Bluebell. I brought her along for your friend Mort, like you told me to. - All right. - Jesus Christ, Croaker, what, you payin' chicks to be with me again? You think I don't know that you pay 'em to sleep with me? I'm not payin' anybody, man. She wants you, check it out. Okay, this is the guy I have to sleep with... to get to Croaker? Okay, come on. Come on! Let's go! Well, this is great. This is great. Rock on, man. Hey, hey. Somethin' wrong? - No, no. - Aw, come on. Aw, well, yeah. Somethin', a little, I guess. Women don't like me. I'm not funny. That's not true. You're very funny. Yeah, maybe. I'm definitely still going to ask Dicky Diamond if I can open for him. - Bob? - Yeah? Am I at all good looking? Yeah, yeah. You look fine. Well, seriously, who do you think is better lookin', me or you? ( laughs ) That's easy, I mean, me. ( sighs ) I've been watching you, waiter boy. Your name's Bob, isn't it? Yes it is. It's Bob. I think we should go look at the moon together. - Don't you? - Yes, I do. I think that's a very, very, very good idea. See you later, Schecky. - Uh, hi. - What the hell do you mean by that? - I just meant, hi. - I can't believe it. Can't a girl come into a bar and have some peace? Oh, all I said was, ''Hi.'' ( sighs ) Yeah? well, fuck you. Hey, beertender, get me a brew, will you? ( flatulence sounds ) Hey, you're Dicky Diamond. You're the ship comedian. Yeah. That's me, Dicky Diamond. What a minute, I know who you are. You're that psycho waiter that keeps watching me from the audience. Oh, yeah. I am a waiter. But, uh, actually, I'm a stand-up comedian, too. I do stand-up. I'm a waiter here till I get stage time. That's great, kid. What the hell are you tellin' me for? Well, I was just wondering, maybe, um, I could open up for you just one night? Open up for Dicky Diamond, huh? ( chuckles ) Kid what do you think this is, The fuckin' Tonight Show? It's a boat. I know that. I was just wondering-- All I'm sayin' is maybe I could-- Let me just tell you a few of my jokes. I'll tell you a few of my jokes, maybe you could listen. Um... all right there's this fat, old lady, ( clears throat ) and she walks into this bar. She's coughing, she's really coughing. - She-- - Whoa, whoa, kid. You're probably a really funny guy, you know. I can tell just by the way you're telling it. But you know what? I just came down here to wait for my girlfriend, and have a beer, relax a little bit, not sit at the bar and hear some dumb-ass comic, tell me some stupid fuckin' jokes, all right? Oh, I was tryin'-- I was just was wondering if I could-- All I'm askin' for is maybe I could go up one night. Just go up and open for you, it's not a big deal. Listen, kid, I don't care. I don't care what you're saying, you get that? I don't care. I don't give a flying fuck what you're saying. All right? Great. I know what you're sayin', I'm sorry if I'm buggin' you. But, all I wanted to do-- I mean I work on the ship, too. I was wondering if you could just let me go up for-- Kid, I don't care. I'm not tryin' to ask anything that's that big of a deal. All I want to do is just maybe open up for you. - I mean-- - I don't care! - Hey... - Hi, Dicky. Where were you, baby? In the bathroom thinking of you. Oh, that's cute. Come on, why don't you give Mr. Giggles a little kiss? Not in front of that pervert. This guy say something to you? No, he just tried to pick up on me, big time. Just stand back. Did you say something to my girlfriend? - No, I--- - I think you did, man. There's your punch line, ya stupid fuck. Oh, man. ( sighs ) That guy is uncool. You know what they say? Behind the mask of a clown, lies a trail of tears. My jaw's killin' me. Schecky, why don't you go home and go to bed? Yeah. All right. I'll just go home and go to bed. Alone again. I can't go to sleep. I'm too depressed. I wonder where I'll be in life in like ten years? In ten years from now, I will be a TV broadcaster, on a television station. I will be married and have two children. I hope to be firmly established in my career, possibly married and with two children. Several children would be nice and just a happy home life. I'll probably be a bagel vendor or something. I know what will cheer me up. Mediation. I'll just go meditate till the sun rises. ( chanting ) Oh, man. I can't get women, I can't get laughs. I'm not even a good waiter. This sucks, I'm so depressed. I think I'm gonna escape reality right now and go to sleep. ( Dicky snickering ) Schecky. Or should I say Porky? ( rim shot ) Aw, Schecky, you got an apple in your mouth. Where's William Tell when you need him? Look at ya. You look just like your sister, a pig. ( whimpering ) You wearin' a straitjacket? Oh, in your case it might be a homo jacket. You're a loser, Schecky. A loser. ( laughing ) You're a loser. You're a loser, Schecky. ( laughing ) ( laughter continues ) Hey, Schecky, here's my closing bit. ( moaning sounds ) Ahh! Oh boy, that dream sucked. I'm gonna go to sleep again and this time it's gonna be better. ( slow tempo music begins ) " I stare through my window " " I watch her and she passes by " " I say to myself, You're such a lucky guy " " To have a girl like her " " is truly a dream come true " " Out of all the fellahs in the world, she belongs to me " " It was just my imagination " " running away with me " " It was just my imagination " " running away with me " " Soon we'll be married, our... ( song fades out ) Mommy? What the hell are you doin', Schecky? Are you tryin' to kill me? Who are these girls? I knew you were suicidal. I knew it. You're gonna die from this, Schecky. Your weenie's gonna fall off, just like your father's. Do you hear me, Schecky? It felt so great. Her breasts were like baseballs. They were hard and firm and they stuck out like torpedoes. Schecky? Schecky? Schecky! Schecky! Schecky! Schecky! Oh, you should have seen her. My God, it was unbelievable. I mean, she was begging for me. She loved me. Talk about luck, I mean, man oh man, oh man, oh man. Did I ever tell you, you look just like my mother? - No. - You really do. - Whoa, what time is it? - It's time for work. Hey, I didn't know you slept in your uniform. - Oh, yeah. - Anyway, she told me her name was Debbi with an ''I.'' And she did a spread for Hustler Magazine. Debbi with an ''I''. Did she do a seven-page spread with a pig? I saw that. Wow. Well, all right, you see there's this girl I met, right? And anything the girl tells me, I do. For example, I asked her on the scale from one to ten, what am I? And she said, ''You're an eight.'' So I peed on her shoes. ''Ur-in-ate.'' I don't know. Maybe you should avoid telling actual jokes, and just stick to improvising and talking to the audience. - I thought it was funny. - Yeah? A lot funnier that that jerk they hired as the ship's comedian. You actually thought that joke was funny? Let me put it this way. He's funny. The other guy's a hack. Yeah. I am funny. He really is a hack, isn't he? - Yeah. - ( bell rings ) I don't want any cheap shots. I don't want any hittin' below the waist. I don't want any food or drink on the mat. It's a new one. May the best man win. Let's go. Dicky: All right, let's go, brillo head. Look at ya. You got more teeth than a fuckin' saw. Look at your mouth. Doin', stunt work for Mr. Ed? ( bell rings ) ( bell rings ) Schecky: Those are nice legs you got there. I saw them the other night, I was in a Japanese restaurant. I used them to pick up my sushi. ( grunting ) Oh, ref, come on. That was below the belt. I didn't see anything. Aw, you're a winner, baby. You're always thinkin'. Is that black hat there to show respect to your dead brain? Oh, jeeze I like that, Sasquatch. Got enough hair on your back, want me to braid it for ya? Speedo bandito. Are you smugglin' in a half a roll of certs? Oh, by the way, I do weddings in case your parents decide on gettin' married. What's that around your neck, your mother's leash? ( birds chirping ) Hey, Schecky! Snap out of it! You looked like you were fantasizing about killing Dicky Diamond or somethin'. Yeah, yeah. We'd better go serve these drinks. Oh, right. Pageant girl: Politics are really weird. They're like, I never think about 'em, unless somebody says, ''What do you think about politics,'' you know? But I think world leaders are real important to the world. World peace would be nice, but, what would be nicer, is that everyone would get whatever they wished for in life. When we can all work as one, that's when world peace will come around. Oh, Panama. General Noriega should be killed for killing people who voted against him. I think he should see a dermatologist, you know? I can tell by just looking at General Noriega, that he has really icky rancid breath, that's so bad, that when he's talking to you, you have to hold your own breath to keep from gagging. I have this really strong sense of smell. He probably doesn't use any form of personal, you know, hygienic protection, you know. Like deodorant. I think he probably has stinky armpits. Probably, you know, like if you don't eat a pizza, you put in the fridge for like a couple of days, or maybe like ten days. Then you get it out, and you leave it out for a couple of hours, and then you went back to take a bite, and that smell that you get just before you put in your mouth. I think that's probably what he smells like. I would want to spend any real time with the man. In fact I'd rather spend a whole day with Ted Bundy. I smell? Bad breath, huh? We'll see who gets the last laugh here. You leftover kangaroo vomit. - See that woman? - Where? Idiot, on the TV there. That woman there. That woman on the TV there? That woman on the TV. I want her killed. Her name is Miss Australia. She said I smelled like pizza. No? Like a pizza? - Pizza. - What kind of pizza? An old pizza. ( sniffs ) An old, uh... ...cheese pizza? ( sniffs ) With uh, anchovies? And uh, what kind of crust? I want her killed. What does that matter? - Uh, round pizza? - It doesn't matter. Kill Miss Australia. You want us to kill the woman on the video screen? That woman on the video tape, yes. Um... you want us to kill that girl there on the video tape that you rented, we gonna kill her? That girl in there now, in the tape that you rented, killed? - Si. - Where is she? - She's in the store with the video tapes? - ( laughing ) Listen to me, huh? I say, ''Lick toilet,'' you lick toilet. I say, ''Pick the nose,'' you pick the nose. I say, ''Kill video tape girl,'' kill video tape girl. - Huh? - Oh, yes, sir. We kill Miss Australia. We gonna kill Crocodile Dundee. - She's dog meat dead, sir. - She's deader that that, sir. She's deader than shrimps on the barbee. - Deader than, uh-- - Hey, Whoa! Whoa! Are you two comedians? Well, we're actually working on a few-- Huh? Go! Go! Kill Miss Australia. Get out! ( singing to himself ) He goes into the room. Everybody runs and hides. He never be a groom. He never catch a bride. It's a sad, sad world. When your head looks like a pizza. But it's sadder, sadder still. When no girl wants to meet ya. Hey! Hey! Hey, Schecky. Fighting isn't gonna solve anything. Shut up, Bob. ( grumbling to himself ) - ( horn blows ) - Ow! Ahh! Fuck you. Fuckin' bullhorn out of nowhere. Fuckin' bullshit bullhorn. I feel like I'm doing the polka for Chrissakes. More stairs than fuckin' Notre Dame. Hi, Dicky. I just had the greatest interview. I spoke all about my political beliefs, and I said what you told me to about General Noriega. Oh, that's fuckin' great, Ellen. Listen, why don't you do me a favor, okay? Take off for awhile, I need some space. Okay, honey? Sure. No problem. I'm gonna get a pastrami sandwich. ( flatulence sound ) Fuckin' pastrami sandwich. She know Dicky Diamond hates pastrami sandwiches. Oh, shit! Ocean! Ahh! Fuck! ( gurgling sound ) Shit! Fuck you. Fuck! Fuck! Ahh, fuck that. I'm walkin' away from this. I'm fuckin' walkin' away from this. You got nothin'. ( flatulence sounds ) Oh, fuck! Fuck that. You son-of-a-bitch. My best hat. Great, more fuckin' stairs. ( breathing heavily ) Fuck! Ah, the Porcelain Goddess. Ah, here I come. ( vomiting ) ( screams ) Ahh, Dicky! Oh, my God! Dicky! Help, man overboard! My, God. Man overboard! Help! Dicky! If Dicky Diamond doesn't play, he's fuckin' fired. He's out. Hey! Hey! ( pounding ) Open the fuckin' door! Oh, shit. Aw, fuck! Hey! ( pounding ) Aw, come on! Somebody open up. Where's the fuckin' maid when you need one. Open the-- aw, fuck! Oh, shit! Richard ''Dicky'' Scott Bryant David Diamond... ...Stienwitz. - ( sobbing ) He was such a funny man. A man who made us laugh. A man who brightened our hearts. And opened up our every day with endless possibilities of laughter. The guy talked about bangin' his grandmother. What is this? Let us pray. ( sobbing ) Let us look in our books. Psalm 29, Jackson 5, Red Socks 4, Yankees 3 in the bottom of the eighth. Is that a porpoise out there? Ashes to ashes, dust to dust. Let us pray that Richard ''Dicky'' Scott Diamond Stienwitz... ...is in heaven, entertaining the angels at that great microphone in the sky. What are we gonna do? Who's gonna make us laugh the rest of the cruise? I mean, who's gonna brighten our days and open our hearts now? - ( continues to sob ) - Who? Oh, man, this is my big chance here. If I volunteer, I'm gonna be the ship's comedian. But, if I don't, I'm just gonna be Schecky the schmuck waiter the rest of my life, and I'll never touch a woman again, and I gotta touch a woman. I just want grab her and-- But, I can't do it. I just can't do it. I don't know. I'm too crazy, I'm nervous. I'm mean, I'm probably the one who killed Dicky Diamond. I'm so jealous of the guy. I'm not gonna do it. I won't do it. There's no-- I can't do it. There's no way I'm gonna-- - Holy-- - Schecky? I am King Neptune, God of the sea. I couldn't help but overhearing what you were thinking. Not that I eavesdrop or anything, but I couldn't help hearing you, uh, well, that you wanted to be the ship comedian. But you have doubts, son, that you shouldn't have. Wait, am I hallucinating here? Are you for real, or what? As real as that big nose at the end of your face. Ah, jeeze. An antisemitic fish. What, you're definitely not a gefilte fish I guess. Listen, you gotta have a sense of humor to be king of that cesspool, sonny. Su casa, is mi casa, comprende? Aw, don't tell me you're worldly. I felt it my duty to go for it. Take the job as ship comedian, these people need you. Hey, hey. They need me? They need me? Yes they need you. What, are you fishing for complements here? Everyone needs to laugh. I've been the brunt of a few too many jokes at the office water cooler, let me tell you. Mis-managment they said. I'll put a hex on Exxon. I remember when I was a prince. Whoa, whoa. I mean, is this gonna be a big, long story? We don't have time for that. You know I got a responsibility for this movie here, and you know, they don't want to hear this. - You understand? - I got a time thing? - Yeah. - I just thought I'd give you a little confidence. You just go ahead Mr. Sailorpants, you just finish. Oh, man. No, really, thank you. - I appreciate it. - But, remember... ...the power of laughter! I'll do it! I'll do it! I'll be the ship comedian. ( banging and singing heard ) ( banging and singing continues ) - Quit banging. - I'm not banging, I'm drumming. - It's good for me. - Quit drumming. Okay. - Knock-knock. - Who's there? Um, the big stinky man. The big stinky man, who? The big stinky man is you. ( laughs ) Shut up, Achmed. You're not funny. I am funny. I'm very funny. Achmed is funny. Oh, man. What happens if I go up there and I die a miserable death? They're not gonna like me. Someone's gonna throw food at me. I'll be hit in the head with a meatloaf. - I'll get thrown overboard. - Schecky. - The sharks are gonna rip my legs off. Schecky! No one's gonna hate you as long as you act natural. Um, I think if we sang a little song right now, you'd feel a little better. - All right. - Okay. " Comedy, such a lovely lady " " Lady " - " She'll pick you up " - " Pick you up " - " When you're feelin' blue " - " Feelin' blue " - " She'll run her fingers through your hair " " You'll feel that someone cares " - " Someone cares " - " About you " - " About you " ( scatting ) - Now don't you feel better? - I do, I do. Okay, now, you don't have to try to be funny, just be yourself. You don't have to tell jokes. Hey, you're right. I'll just talk to 'em. I'll just ask them questions about themselves and that's it. Right. That's good. - Fix your hair. - Okay. Wipe your eyebrows. Wipe your nose. Smell your breath. Check your armpits. Tie your shoes. And sit up straight. Holy shit! Look at me. I look like a fuckin' zombie. You fuckin' sicko. Holy shit. All right. All right. That's it. I'm fuckin' dying in here. I'm gonna shrivel up like a fuckin' piece of bacon. Oh, boy. I'm very nervous right now. This is a frightening thing to do, take over for a dead comedian that everybody loved so much. - ( sobbing ) - All right, here goes. I'm gonna do it right now. Hey, everybody, how ya doin' tonight? ( audience groans ) I'm glad to hear it, that's good. Ah, you, sir? Hi. Hi. - What's your name? - Dave. Dave? We've got Dave here. Dave, what do you do for a living? I'm a construction worker. Dave's a construction worker, everybody. So, Dave, what do you construct? I construct buildings. What the fuck else would I construct? Oh! Oh! That's good. All right. So, Dave, do you think that construction is an easy job, or you think it's a hard job? You know what? Listen butthole, why don't you quit tryin' to be funny, because all you're doin' is pissin' me off. Whoa. Um, hey, that kinda sounded like my ex-girlfriend. - Girl: You suck! - She's a little bit bigger than Dave. - ( nervous laugh ) - Man: Get off, big nose. All I'm saying is, I'm not very good with relationships. Girl: Boring! Hi. How you doin' there? What's your name? I hate you. ( microphone begins to feedback ) Oh, this isn't going too well, is it? Um, why don't we start over right now? - Man: Get off! - Just give me a chance. ( audience begins booing ) Okay, look, here's a good joke. All right, there's a proctologist, right? ( audience begins to chant ) We want Dicky! We want Dicky! We want Dicky! We want Dicky! - We want Dicky! - Hey! Hey! What do you want? The guy's dead. You want to hear a corpse or something? A corpse would be funnier than you are. I wanna hear Croaker sing. ( audiences cheers ) ( cheering ) No, no, no. No, no, no. Hey. All right. - Let's rock! - ( wild cheering ) ( rock and roll drum beat ) ( guitar riff begins ) ( begins singing: ''I Wanna Slap Your Cat'' ) ( music continues - crowd screaming ) ( crowd screams ) Give me that jacket. Give it here. ( cheering ) I failed, man. I failed. King Neptune was wrong. Nobody needs me. King Neptune? Yeah, King Neptune, he's God of the sea. Oh, there he is, right over there. Schecky, uh, can I be honest with you? Yeah, Bob, you can be honest with me. Come on, let's take a walk. Schecky... I hate comedians. Not all comedians, though. Just 99 percent of them. See to me, stand-up comedy is such a sad thing. I mean it's so pathetic. It's absolutely the most degrading thing a human being can put himself through. Standing up on stage alone, talking about how fat, or how bald, or how ugly you are. I mean, spilling your guts about your family history and your alcoholic father, blatantly begging the audience to love you. To accept you and give you the love that you never had as a child. It's pathetic, Schecky. It's an empty-- Bob, what are you tying to say? Let me put it this way. Comedy is like this life preserver. Ah, comedy is round with ropes hangin' off it. See, Schecky, that wasn't funny. I know you probably said that to make me laugh and to like you more, but, you didn't have to. - I like you enough already. - Bob? Stop it. Stop, I'm gonna have to ask you to stop being psychoanalytic, you're just too stupid to tell me anything, all right? I like comedy. I like being funny. That's it, all right? Okay. Okay. Then maybe you should try telling some jokes this time, instead of just being yourself. - Maybe that would work. - That is a great idea, Bob. Jokes? You hit it right on the head. But first, let's see a montage of some beautiful women. ( rock and roll music playing ) " Oh, yeah " " I met a gentle woman " " She took my heart away " " She said I had it comin' to me " " But I wanted it that way " " I think any love is good lovin' " " So I took what I could get, yeah I took what I could get " " She looked at me with them big brown eyes as said " " You ain't seen nothin' yet " " Baby, you ain't seen nothin' yet " " Here's somethin' you'll never forget " " Baby, you ain't seen nothin' yet. " - Smells good. - I know. Smells good a lot. Your wife, she make that for you? Yes. - Nice wife. - Uh-huh. I don't have wife. Your salami, it's very big. Big enough for two peoples. Big enough for three peoples. There's enough there for whole family of peoples... ...for weeks. Cut me little slice. - No! - Cut me a little. - No! - Give me a little cut? - No! - Why Not? Give me a little. - No! - Give me a little cut. Give me a slice. - Is this the way generals wear 'em? - Yes. This one goes on over and this one goes under. One goes up. ( laughing ) You know what my mother says about you? She said you're an untrained animal. ( laughing ) But, you should hear what my father said. - What? - I can't-- No, no, no. Go to this ship. What is this? Robinson Crusoe? What does your father say? Oh, no. My father doesn't-- I promised him. Pinkie swear I couldn't tell. - Does he like me or no? - He says he has to like you. ( laughing ) I don't think he voted for you, though. Well, we forgive that. I tell my father that. That you'll let him out of jail. Yes, I will, in a couple of years. A couple of years? Well, he's not that old. Oh, you're terrible. You are really bad. He's a good man. In a couple of years he'll-- - A couple of years? - Well, yes. - He'll find psychology. - For what? He'll find psychology in the can. - ( laughing ) - Is that where you find it? Sure, in the can. You wear these fuckin' things? These fuckin' patent leather, fuckin'-- Ridiculous fuckin' shoes you been wearin'. Not even good for bangin' on the fuckin' door. Hello! I don't know, maybe it is and maybe it's not. I don't think it's grounds for legal action, Croaker. - That's all I'm sayin'. - I don't care what it costs, man. I want that guy sued. All right, I'm singin' my song, I made it very clear to that guy, I wanted to be shot from a higher angle. He shoots me from straight on, It makes my nose look absolutely huge. - My fans are not gonna accept-- - ( banging heard ) Hey! Hey! Let me out. It's Dicky Diamond, I'm in the fuckin' bathroom. Whoa! Wait a minute, is that-- Oh, that's that guy. That's the dead guy. The comedian. Whoa, man. This is weird. Because if he's dead, how can he be screaming? I don't know, Croaker. Maybe it's his ghost. Wait a minute, man. You're scaring me. Don't scare me like that, man. I can't take this ghost stuff. How do I get off this boat? ( banging continues ) Let me out, you fucks. This ship is haunted, man. Get me off this ship. This ship is haunted. Croaker, listen to me! Listen to me! Listen to me! Listen to me, Croaker. Let me out. Fuckin' fag socks. Look at this shit. Maybe I can go out through there. The fuckin' toilet. I'll flush myself out. Come on. Somebody, please. - Yeah! - You cheated. - That's not cheating. - That's cheating. Are you gonna wear that for your comedy act? - I was thinkin' of it, yeah. - No, no. I think you should wear your pink shirt. If I'm gonna change shirts I'll probably wear my green shirt. No, no, no. The pink shirt shows off your tan. - It looks really nice. - It's a nice shirt. You're right, but, I like green. - The pink is much better. - No. - You see green- luck. - No, no. Pink, pink. - I like green. - Pink. - Green is good. - Pink. - Green. - Pink. - Green! - Pink! Green! - Why don't you wear 'em both? - Yeah, I could do that. Where are we? We're in the middle of the ocean. I know we're in the middle of the ocean, you idiot! Where in the middle of the ocean? Who do I look like to you? A compass? You are navigator, stupid! You are navigator, stupid. Who is holding the map? Who is holding the map? Oh. - I am. - So, you are our navigator. Give it to me. Give it to me. - I am navigator. - Give it to me. - I am navigator. - Give it to me. - Oh, my. Look at that. - Huh? I want thank you for giving me another chance up here. You're really nice to me. I appreciate it. I swear this time you're not gonna be disappointed. Because I been workin' on an act. - Man: Who cares. - Thank you, Thank you. I'll tell you what happened to me inside. There's was an old lady in there, right? And these four guys were really messin' with her, and givin' her trouble. These hoodlums, bad lookin' characters. And, um, one of them stole her purse. I was watching this the whole time- grabbed her by the ring, he was tryin' to yank her wedding ring off. But she was fighting, she was screaming, ''Help, me. Help me!'' Finally I couldn't take it anymore. I ran over to the guy and said, ''Hey, buddy, why don't you put some butter on her finger, and the ring will slide right off?'' ( audience boos _ heckles ) Achmed? Do you like me? - No. - Not at all? Not at all. I like you. - So? - So, you should like me, too. You know? It's the boat! - It's the boat! - The boat! - The boat! - Miss Australia, you are dead. Well, don't think I'm a bad guy, because I'm not a bad guy. I'm pretty cool. I mean I have a conscience. That's what I'm trying to say. When I was a kid I used to steal Alka Seltzer all the time, and I'd feed the sea gulls and they'd blow up. ( audience boos ) I don't get it. I think this is funny. Is it me? Do I have no idea what makes people laugh? Do I know nothing about the art of comedy? I wonder what Milton Berle would do if he was in this spot. Milton Berle's voice: Hey, kid, you got a light? That sounded like Milton Berle. Are you Milton Berle? If not, I had a lot of fun with his wife. Were you just talkin' to yourself? Did I hear you say you were a stand-up comic? Yes, sir. You're pretty good lookin' for one. I love that shirt you're wearing. ( laughter ) You never throw anything away, do you? - ( laughter ) - I'm kiddin'. - So, have a seat. - Right here at your table? - No, in the kitchen. - ( laughter ) Thank you, Mr. Berle. - What's your name? - Schecky Moskowitz. Schecky Moskowitz. With a name like that you should get a laugh right away. So, kid, it looks like you have a problem. You're thinkin' about something. Tell me... what can I do for you? Well, Milton, I'm sorry, Mr. Berle, I need your advice on getting laughs. I was on this ship and I did my act, and nobody laughed. I couldn't understand why. Tell me one of the jokes that you did on the ship. All right. Okay. There are these two hoodlums, right? And they see this old lady and this lady's got this big ring on, right? So they run over and they start yanking on it and pullin' on her ring. And this lady's lookin' at me goin', ''Help me! Help me!'' You know, I had to do something, so I went over to the hoodlums- Hold it. Hoodlums? Is this the butter joke? - ( laughing ) - Yeah, that's the joke. No wonder they didn't laugh. Were there any hoodlums or gangsters in the audience, when you told that joke? Uh, no. I told it to a bunch of beauty queens. Beauty queens? Oh! And then I told them the one about blowin' up the sea gulls. - Blowing up sea gulls? - ( laughter ) Kid, you're using the wrong technique. Young man, come over here. - Have you got a pencil? - Yes, sir. - Thank you. You got a pad? - Sure. That's it. Thank you. - Now you're working. - ( laughter ) Schecky... All right. Don't make a federal case out of it. ( laughter ) What I'd like you to do now is write these gags down, Schecky. I think all those beautiful queens will identify with them. Last week I dated a girl that had everything a man would want. Mustache, hair under the arms, - bushy eyebrows... - ( laughter ) If you're talkin' about the same girl, say, ''What a nose!'' - She had to lift it to eat. - ( laughter ) And follow that up with, ''One good lipstick brought out her lips, and one good sneeze brought out her teeth. She had very affectionate eyes, they always kept lookin' at each other. And when she'd open one eye, all she could see was the other one. And her boobs were very small, so small she had to carry her nipples in her pocket.'' Now, uh, you try those jokes. They'll all work. They always did. Well, so long, kid. - Lots of good luck. - Thank you, Mr. Berle. Oh, uh... one more thing. Schecky, always remember that you're a comic, and you possess the strongest weapon for bring people together and making them feel happy. There's nothing more important in the world, than the power of laughter. Remember that. - Bye, now. - ( applause ) Wow, the power of laughter. King Neptune was talkin' about the power of laughter. Maybe this phrase is gonna tie the whole story together in some clearer way or somethin'. Umm... Uh, where am I goin? I have no idea where I am. I'm walkin' around like I know where I'm goin'. I don't know what-- Let's see, how do I get back to the ship? Maybe I should use some magical comedy phrase. I'll try that. Why'd the chicken cross the road? Aw... nothin'. Um, why do firemen wear red suspenders? No good. Nothin'. Uh, take my wife, please. That's the one, right there. Take my wife, please. Take my wife, please... Take my wife, please. Take my wife, please. ( cheering ) Hey! Hey, thank you very much. Thanks a lot. Thank you. All right. Oh, thank you, very much. Thank you. I appreciate it. Well anyway, I see this guy on the street the other day, he tells me he's got Agent Orange, I said ''At least you have an agent.'' ( laughing ) All right. Okay. I was talkin' to my grandma the other day, what a lady, you'd love her. She's deaf in both ears, right? So we bought her two hearing aids. She keeps puttin' 'em both in the same ear. She's deaf over here, she's got bat-like hearing over here. Did somebody say nursing home? - That's her. - ( laughing ) - ( machine gun firing ) - ( screaming ) What's happening? What's goin' on? Hey, is there a sale on bikinis or something? - What's wrong with you? - I'm doin' great. These people love me. I'm all over. Come on. We gotta get out of here. Why? My, God! My, God! Terrorists! Terrorists! - That's why. - All right. Holy shit! We fuckin' hit an iceberg! We hit an iceberg! Holy shit, another Titanic! Hurry up, Schecky. Come on. - Get in here. - I'm coming. Where's Miss Australia? We want her now! She's ours! We are not foolin' around here! We got a big, fat problem here! We need to have a little talk. This is no joke. Fuck. ( microphone squealing ) Testing. One, two. three. Hello, this is going out to all the people on the boat. All the people. All we want us Miss Australia. - Miss Australia? - Miss Australia? Miss Australia? Isn't that the late Dicky Diamond's girlfriend? How would I know? I haven't done any scenes with Dicky Diamond and his girlfriend. I'm quite sure it is. That's great. They want to kill her. She's a real bitch. You guys shouldn't talk mean about people behind their backs. I didn't see you there. I'll say it to your face, you're a pig. You were mean to me the other night in the bar. I was a different woman back then when Dicky was alive. Now that he's dead, I'm my own woman. I've got my own mind, it works for me and nobody else. Good for you. - Miss Australia. - Miss Australia, you little kangaroo. Big mouth, bad breath. - You better come out. - Oh, my God. It's time to meet you mayor. My God, they want me to meet the mayor? No. I think he's speaking in broken English. He wants you to meet your maker. He wants to kill you. - Do you have an education? - ( begins to sob ) Miss Australia, when I find you, I'm gonna take your hands and cut off all your little fingernails, and I'm gonna swallow them. And they're gonna go through my digestive tract. But the only thing is, they're not going to digest. Oh, my God! He can't! All I said was that General Noriega had bad breath. It took me months to grow these. I broke one and just as it was growing back, I'd break another one. They're finally all even. He can't do it! He can't! I gotta get out of here! Bob: Ellen! Ellen, wait! ( chuckling ) Don't women look funny when they run in heels? Let's go. - There she goes! - Go! Go! ( gun fire ) Come on. Come on. Hey, what's with the shirt? - This one? - Yeah, that shirt. I like the pink one, Bob likes the green one. - Which one do you like? - They both stink. - ( gun shot ) - Ow! Oh, God! What's wrong? Just because I'm pretty, everybody thinks I'm stupid. - Where did that come from? - I hate being beautiful. Sometime I wish I was an ugly old hag, with burn marks or warts all over my face, so people would run in terror when they looked at me. Why? Because being pretty isn't pretty. Look, look. We don't have time for this. See, I have this morbid desire to be deformed. God, that's beautiful. I never realized how hard it was for a young girl to be so gorgeous. It's a living hell. ( gunfire ) Climb the ladder. Why do you want them to climb the ladder? ( sighs ) Hey! Hey! Hey! Oh, God! They're gonna kill me before I get a chance to be an actress. All my hopes. All my dreams. I had a line on General Hospital last week. You did? What was it? Can I get you something from the bar? Oh, my God! I say that all the time. Really? I'd wish you'd been there to coach me. Me, too. Oh, jeeze! I can't believe this. You think I should tell her about Bob's little infection? Should I? Forget it. Hello, Miss Australia? You'd better come out here, or we're going to start killing hostages in three seconds. - Three seconds! - Starting with this girl here. Maybe we should try to save her. No. She always wins whenever we compete. This could be my only chance for Miss International. Now that is a competitive bitch right there. I'm so selfish. I'm going to give myself up. You guys stay here. I was kidding. Look, I think the General's a great guy. - ( cocks rifles ) - I only said it to be smart. Look, he probably smells terrific. Not to mention, you guys aren't so bad-- ( screams ) Shut up! Shut up! Hey, Bob. What are we gonna do about this? Maybe we should try to save her? Yeah. Yeah. Bob? - What? - I figured you just had your tongue down her throat, maybe you should go and save her. ( screaming and hollering ) Come on, Schecky. Don't put me on the spot. I have a really strong fear of death. I have a fear of death, but I also have a stronger sense of guilt, man, and jeeze, you were just makin' out with her. And I figured you'd kinda want to save her. Fine! Fine! I'll go! I'll go and get shot saving some girl I was just kissing. You stay here, coward. Get off of her. I was lying to Bob right there. I do have a stronger fear of death compared to my sense of guilt. But death makes me nauseous I don't want death. You get buried underground. You get dirt all over you. You get worms in you. That's not good. So if I get out there, there's a chance I'll get shot. And that's not good for my career. You know that and I know that. I gotta get going. Come to think of it, where do you think we go when we die? I'm thinkin' of that right now. I feel everyone goes to purgatory first. And then after everyone prays for you, you go to heaven. Heaven is a place up above- Pearly gates. Heaven is bright lights, real cool, real serene. Lots of angles and things. Ah! I'll tell you what I think. I think that when we die we get in a kinda, dark, lonely spiral-- right down to nothing. That's where we're goin'. And that's not cool with me. So, I'm not gonna get out there, because I could get shot and that would happen to me. Milton Berle: Schecky, remember the power. Kill 'em with laughs before they kill you. That was that Berle guy again. I guess I'd better shut up. What? What? Milton Berle: Use the power of laughter. Laughter? Power of laughter? He always said that. Maybe that has a meaning or something. Power of laughter? Oh! I know what he means. Yeah! Who are you? Moskowitz. Schecky Moskowitz. What's your name? - Achmed. - Achmed, with a lot of spit. What do you do for a livin', huh? I fight for the people. The people's people. - I like people. - Freedom fighter. That's me. I work for the rebels sometimes. Sometimes I deliver for Domino's. Half hour or less. Okay, Miss Australia, any last requests? Yes, I'd like to sing one last song. I won the Miss Australia contest with this last year. And it would really mean a lot to me. Okay. Sing your heart out. " Australia sons let us rejoice " " For we are young and free..." This is how my mother carried me when I was a baby. Can you let go of me please, because I'm a little sick. You know when I'm sick my mother always tells me to drink liquids. I think she's right 'cause every time I drink a solid I choke. ( laughs ) ( continues singing the Australian National Anthem ) Speaking of drinks. This is what I do to get free drinks. I insult the girl and say, ''Baby, you're kind of ugly.'' She takes the drink and throws it in my face, I open up my mouth, right? After six or seven girls, I've got a good buzz going. ( singing off-key - voice cracking ) Okay, okay. That was beautiful. - That was beautiful. - ( continues singing ) Okay, that's enough. ( laughing ) Why don't you give it a whirl? - Me? - Go ahead. So I said to the man... take my wife, please? ( laughing ) Speaking of my wife, she's so fat, she's so fat, that when she sits around the house, she sits all the way around the house. ( laughing ) Get the girl off. Darling. I'd like to be a comedian. I make the people laugh. I think they love me. - Are you okay? - Yeah. - Are you okay? - Well, I have a little bump on my head, but I don't think it shows a bruise. Why did you save me? Because I love you. Oh, jeeze, do you? I love you, too. Will you marry me? Oh, yeah. I think I'm a lover not a fighter. Kiss me. What about killing Miss Australia? No, forget it. Schecky said we could move in with him, and we could live in America with him, and he can teach us the fine art of comedy. - Really? - Really. Will he write our material for us? I will write all your material. Of course. If you guys want, I'll get you in a movie. See that, there's a movie camera right there. Why don't you guys do some comedy right now? - For that camera. - The movies? Okay... Okay. Um... So, um... what's invisible and smells um... like, like carrots. Yeah, okay. I know that one. I don't know that one. You don't know it? It's little, tiny bunny fart. ( both laughing ) Daddy, let me out. I won't fool around anymore. I promise. Who's running over to first base? With the second base guy? Must be third base. You don't have any love. You don't deserve to wear this. Somebody, please let me out. I swear to God I'll never flip anybody off again. I'll never curse. Somebody, please. If you're out there... ...please. ( door unlocks ) You stupid motherfucker. You stupid fucks. I'm an atheist. ( laughing ) ( terrorist heard in background doing comedy routine ) Hey! Hey! ...how many? - Three. - Three? Three one-eyed lizards? Why is it three? - Because one of them is blind. - ( laughing ) Fuckin' ugly motherfuckers. Get the fuck off my stage. - I want my fuckin' job back! - ( audience begins booing ) Woman: Hey, look, that's the dead guy. Man: Yeah. That's the dead comedian. Dead? You, stupid, motherfucker. I'm not dead. I'm right here. I was locked in the bathroom, - you stupid-- - ( cheering ) You fuckin' highjackin'-- ( hollering ) Thank you very much. ( laughing ) ( gunshot - glass shattering electrical buzzing ) Well, all right. Everything worked out just fine now didn't it? Let's see, that rock star and his sleezy manager, they have girls hangin' all over 'em now. And Bob, he has a gorgeous wife-to-be. How he got her I'll never know, but, stranger things have happened. And even those terrorists. They got what they wanted, an audience. I guess I got what I wanted too, you know? Now I'm a big, funny comedian. I'm even a hero, but, something's missing. Hey, Schecky. I've got a surprise for you. Neptune, how you been? I haven't seen you in awhile. Swell! I've got someone I want you to meet. - Slimly! - Slimly? Hello. This is my daughter, Slimly. Hello, Slimly. My little guppy's been watching you for a week now. And she's just been begging me to introduce you to her. You've been watching me in your conch shell? Yes. I really, really wanted to meet you. Wow! She is so sweet. Hey, King Neptune, I was just wondering if I could take her to the bow of the ship and maybe give her a kiss to close the movie, is that all right? Go ahead, go ahead. But have her back at the reef by eleven. King Neptune: And no tongues.
