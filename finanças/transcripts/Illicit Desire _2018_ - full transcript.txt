You almost ready? You've been in there a while. Are you questioning me? - No. No, of course not. - Good. Because you know who's in charge here, right? - Right? - Yes. Huh? Good. You know what happens to bad little boys, right? - They... get punished? - Mm-hmm. Ugh! I'm in charge, right? - Yes. - Yes? - Yes, Mistress. - Yes? You're a little boy. You're gonna get punished. Yeah, you know, what little bad boys get? Yes. They get these stuffed in your face, right? Yeah, this is what you want, huh? Yeah? Use your teeth. Take it off. Better than that. I'm trying, Mistress. Yeah, you trying? You're doing a shitty job. Hmm? Take it off. Take it off. All right, now I want you... That's right. I want you to eat this fucking pussy. Oh, is that the best you've got? Come on. You like girls? Yeah? That's right. Keep going. Ooh. Oh, is that too hard? Ooh. Bad boys get spanked. You're a bad boy, aren't you? Aren't you? - Yes, Mistress. - Yes? Yes, my name's Mistress, right? Yes. Ooh, you know you like that. You like being punished. You're a little boy, right? You're a little bad nice boy. Ooh. Come on, eat it! Do it right. What are you thinking? I'm the mistress, remember? I'm in charge. You do what I tell you. Get behind me. Oh, my God. Yes. Is that good, Mistress? - Go harder. - You like that? Go harder. Try and fuck me like a real man. Yeah? Go harder. Yes. Yes. Is that good, Mistress? Yes. Ooh. Yeah, do you like that? Bad boys need to get punished. You get a harder one for flinching. Yeah. Ooh, you're a bad boy, aren't you? Yeah? Yeah, you wanna get punished? - Punish me. - Yeah. I'll punish you. Yeah. Yes! Yes! Yeah! Oh! Market research shows that 80% of women between the ages of 18 and 35 do not use any products like this. But of the 20% that do, 85% of them make their purchases online. - Why? - It comes in two days. Exactly. Which tells us that they're too embarrassed to go shopping. Are you too embarrassed to go shopping? - For these? - Yes. I don't think that's any of your business. Actually, it is my business. It's all of our business, because we've been tasked to rebrand these sex toys. You mean finding a new purpose for them? No, I mean, making it something that women can't live without - like food, shelter... - Vibrating dick. Right on. The question is how do we get the other 80% interested. Who says they're not interested? Okay, so let's say they are interested. Why are they not buying one? Because they don't trust the Internet. Well, you can buy them in person. I have. But I warn you, if you do, you might see your mom's best friend in there looking at the leather. Where exactly is this place? Okay, so buying one in person might make people embarrassed. Uncomfortable. Clearly the success of this product is overshadowed by the sexually-repressed nature of its customer base. A customer base that needs a little arousal. I thought that was the job of the man. Well, the man's not always around. And when he's around, he's not always there. Well, maybe he would be there if she was a little more receptive. And maybe she would be more receptive if he made more of a commitment. Well, maybe some guys just aren't ready yet. And maybe some women who just turned 30 don't have very many years left to wait. Excuse me. Can we get back to the dildos, please? Sure. It's all water under the bridge. It's really vibratey. What's wrong with you? Oh. Oh. - Okay. - Sorry I didn't see you standing there. It's okay. No harm, no foul. I haven't seen you around here before. Yeah, it's my first day. I'm the new intern, Bridget. I'm Garrett. - Are you sure about that? - Yeah. - Welcome to M3. - Thanks. It's good to be here. Garrett, a word. In private? Of course. It was a pleasure meeting you. See you around. How's the sex toy project coming? Uh, it's coming. Any ideas? Yeah. I mean, that you'd like to share. I'd rather save it for the presentation. If this isn't delivered on Monday, the client will drop us. And if the client drops us, that is going to look very bad for you. Your first big campaign. You need this, Garrett. I know I do. How long have you worked here, Garrett? Almost a year. I remember hiring you. You seemed so young, so ambitious, so virile. Thank you. Don't make me change my opinion of you, Garrett. No, ma'am. You can't afford to be distracted by hot, young interns in short skirts and sparkly lip gloss. You're too mature for that. Have a seat. Why? I wanna show you something. I strongly believe that every marketing exec should have a firm understanding of the products that he's trying to sell. Have you ever seen a woman get off on one of these? No. Not in person. Well, allow me to demonstrate. Dirty martini for the lady and a scotch neat for me. I don't know... Excuse me. Have to take this. No problem. Another one, please. What are you working on? New campaign. - For dildos? - Sex toys. That's pretty hot. Have you ever used any of them? No. How can you sell them if you haven't tried them? Where's Cory? His mommy called. He lives with her. He's young. Like most of the guys I know. You live with your mommy, Garrett? No. I didn't think so. If fact, I know some things about you. Like your amazing track record. That's kinda why I chose M3 when I heard you moved there. You used to be a marketing genius. Used to me? Well, you haven't led a major campaign since you've been with M3, but everybody has their dry spells, and I'm sure you're due, and you might rub off on me. If I were you, I'd keep it real. Real? Let a bunch of real, live women play with your sex toys and you show us the looks on their faces. Hi, Garret. Hope we're not bothering you. - You ready? - Always ready. See ya, Garrett. Already solve your dildo problems? I'm still toying with it. What happened to Cory? He had to go home. Past his bed time. - Hmm. - What about you? Are you headed off to bed too? No, I got too much work to do. Maybe you could use an assistant. Would you like a drink? I'm good. If we start drinking now, we won't get anything accomplished. I like your work ethic. It has nothing to do with work. Only pleasure. This is Garrett. Leave a message after the tone. Hey, Garrett. Where are you? I have a few ideas for the project. Call me, okay? Hey. Good morning. I thought you were gonna sleep all day. It's only 6:30. Yeah, well, I've been up since 5:00, and I have a great idea for you. Once you eat, uh, I can give you a sneak peek, and then we'll shower. Sounds good. Here's that other one. I'll see you at lunch. Garrett. - Hey, you're late. - Yeah, I know. I slept through my alarm. Why didn't you call me back last night? I was working late, and I didn't see my phone. I'm sorry. What's up? I think I know the angled for the sex toy campaign. I've been crunching the numbers again, and while women aren't buying, men are buying at triple the rate. - What does that tell you? - I don't know. They like playing with toys, too. They're less inhibited, at least in public. So if a girl wants something, her guy will go get it for Valentine's Day, for anniversaries. It's all right here in this research paper I dug up. Men do the buying. So we either change that or focus a campaign on men. Garrett? Are you listening? Yeah, we already took care of it. - We? - I think you're gonna love it. What? My husband's away at work all day, but that's okay. Oh my God. Oh, yes. Oh, my God. Oh, Master... For when he's not around. Jenna, what do you think? I think the kids are going to love asking mommy and daddy what that was all about. I must say, Garrett, I didn't think you had that in you. It was a group effort. Of course, we don't need to go that extreme for the mainstream outlets. We can simply show women acting suggestively, only to find out that they are simply riding in a truck or one of those mechanical bulls. The actress says, "It's just like riding a bull." - And then we see the brand name. - "Oh, Master." And we're out. Looks like someone is taking you under his wing. I'm a lucky girl. Good job, everyone. You're sleeping with her. - With who? - The new girl Bridget. Why would you think that? Is that where you were last night? Was she with you? These are not the choices you want to be making, Garrett. Not in this stage of your career. You need to be wise, you need to be creative. You can't let yourself get distracted. - I am not distracted. - She's too young for you. Oh, I'm sorry. Am I interrupting something? - It's okay. - Yeah, we're finishing up here. I'll let you two get back to your group project. Yeah, I'm sorry about that presentation. Next time we'll be sure to make it less uncomfortable for you. I don't think you're capable of that. You used to sleep with her, didn't you? We used to live together. Then that explains that she's not very happy about us. Us? That pitch meeting was such an incredible rush, the way we went back and forth together, totally in sync. It turned me on, got me hot. I think that video got everyone hot. That's the point. But what if the client doesn't like it? Sex sells. I'll bet they'll beg for it. - Oh, hey. - Come on, I want you. - No, not here. - Then later at your house. I gotta finish putting the presentation together. We'll do it together. I'll call you. Good. I'll be waiting. Woman: Hello? Hey, thanks for the dinner. Sorry I couldn't stay, but I have other plans. What kind of plans? Look out your bedroom window. You still there? Yeah, I'm here. Hurry, before I catch a cold. I was gonna call you later. You shouldn't leave a girl waiting. I still have more work to do. Mm, later. Bridget? Bridget? I'm sorry I'm late. It's two days in a row. What have you got for me? Uh, something more subtle as discussed. I think the client will be very pleased. Oh, wait a second. - Uh... - What is this? Uh, a mistake. No, no, no, wait. I want to see. This is really not what I intended to show you. I don't know how this happened. You don't need me to explain it to you, do you? Sorry I'm late. I... Oh, no. This is the presentation. I somehow mixed up the flash drives this morning. Could you give us a minute? Of course. Hey, wait up. You recorded us together. I thought we could use the footage for another idea I had. I somehow mixed up the flash drives. Well, that mix-up cost me my job. I can get your job back. Yeah, how're you gonna do that? I have my way with people. Like you had your way with me? Oh, come on, Garrett, I'm not using you. I think we're amazing together. Much better than you and Sonja. She's a jealous bitch and way too old for you. I don't want this, Bridget, I wanna go home. And I want you to stay. Bridget, give me the keys. Come get them, Garrett. - Oh, you want it rough? - No, I don't want it at all. - We're done. - Come on, Garrett. It's over. Buy you a drink? I already got one. Then you buy me one. Does it mean you're talking to me again? Maybe. I haven't decided yet. You were right about Bridget. I was blinded. She's young, she's beautiful. I might've been blinded, too. But I lost my job. So what're you gonna do about it? I don't know. Talk to Sonja, see if she'll give me another chance. No, I mean about Bridget. Oh, I already talked to her. It's over. Girls like Bridget don't rollover very easily. In fact, I bet breaking up with her made her want you even more. You watch too many movies. I'm just saying, you should watch your back. Hey, I thought you wanted to have some fun, but you've hardly said two words to me. I'm sorry, Cory, I'm just... I'm a little distracted with Garrett getting fired today. I mean, I thought he was gonna be my mentor, but now... Buy me another? I think you've had enough. I didn't ask you out to count my drinks. Look, it sucks, but your job is safe, especially if I become the next marketing director. You? Sonja's never gonna promote Jenna. And I have the most seniority after her. I like a man with aspirations. It turns me on. Oh, yeah? It gets me hot. You wanna get out of here? Don't make me beg. I don't know. Maybe it's a blessing in disguise. Maybe I need a change. Maybe I should start my own firm. I know you always wanted to do that. Yeah, but I was too scared. So I never took a chance. Maybe it's time for me to take a risk. This has got to stop. - What? - I'll be right back. - Let's do it right here. - Are you sure? I want it now, and I want it rough. What's going on? She's trying to make me jealous. Is it working? Let's get out of here. Thanks for taking me home. No problem. Listen, uh... I know things between us haven't been good in a while. I'm sorry. It's my fault. No, it's mine. I mean, I'm the one who broke up with you, and I can't help getting jealous anytime I see you with another woman. Yeah, but if I knew how good I had it back then, we'd still be together. - It's Bridget. - Her timing's amazing. It's like she's watching us. - What's up, Bridget? - Something bad has happened. Something bad? I'm in the hospital. Garrett, thanks for coming. What happened? I was with Cory at the bar, and we drank a little bit too much, and he started getting really rough with me, and When I asked him to stop, he started pushing me around. Where is he now? I don't know. I passed out. Fortunately someone found me and called 9-1-1. Garrett, I'm scared. What if he wants to kill me? Why would he want to kill you? I think he was in love with me, but he knew he couldn't have me. You just never know people, what they're capable of. I'm sorry about my behavior. I'm just... I'm really young and I'm only 19. I'm learning and I just don't want you to hate me. I'm new to the city and I don't really know anyone else. It's okay. It's all good between us. I mean, I'm here, aren't I? So you'll stay with me tonight? I can't. I have to go back home. But I don't want to be alone, Garrett, I'm scared. I mean, what if he tries to come back? Please. I'm asking as a friend. What do you got for me? Right there. - What're you doing here? - Where's Cory? He's not in yet. What happened last night? Bridget's in the hospital with bruises all over her face and body. Supposedly, he attacked her and knocked her unconscious. - Cory? - I know, it's hard to believe. - Did you try calling him? - Yeah, he didn't pick up. She's lying. Well, then we need to find him. Garrett, what a nice surprise. Come to beg for your job back? - Miss White? - Yes. Detective Hammer, homicide. I got a couple of questions for you. You know, I've been thinking about what went down the other day, and I think I was a bit too harsh on you. I mean, when you consider the nature of the campaign and that you and I got caught up in our own research. You're a man. It's hard to control those urges. So I've been thinking about giving you a second chance. And what do I have to do for this second chance? Oh, Garrett, you're so cynical. I would never ask you to do anything that wasn't totally professional. However, considering that we are in 3 and I'm the only M that actually still runs the place, I think it's for me to determine what is professional and what is not professional. Sonja... stick a dildo in it. Garrett! Angie, get in here. I can't believe Cory's dead. Yeah, I'm sorry for your loss. I've just got a couple of questions to ask. Yeah, of course. 'Cause we understand he's the one who put you here. Yeah, um... Cory gets a little rough when he drinks um, and maybe we just drank a little bit too much last night, but I told him I wanted it rough. Go on. Maybe I fell and hit my head or something. I don't know. And I just thought maybe he got scared and ran off. Hmm, so you weren't planning on filing charges against him or anything. Oh, God no. If anything, it was my fault. Hmm. And who'd want to kill him? Um, I don't know. I mean, there's this guy Garrett from the office, I went out on one date with him and he was really into me, but he was like way too old for me, so I don't know, maybe... Maybe when I told him no, he got jealous. Or maybe his ex-girlfriend did. - Ex-girlfriend? - Jenna. She works at M3, too. She doesn't like me. Maybe she wanted to hurt me. I don't know. I wanna show you something. You ever see this before? - Garrett Smith? - Yeah. Detective Hammer, homicide. I got a couple of questions for you. Is this your box? Yes. Everything in it is yours? Yes. Anything missing? I don't know. Should there be? How would you describe your relationship with Bridget White? Does this have something to do with Cory? Did you find him? Oh, we found him. He was stabbed in the heart with your letter opener. She killed him. You're all set. Just let me know if you need anything else. Thanks, I will. Thanks for coming to get me. You'd do the same thing for me. Do you really think they'll arrest her? The detective said he'd go back and ask her some questions. And she'll lie just like she lied before. She's a crazy sociopath. She'll say and do whatever necessary to maintain her innocence. So we'll take matters in our own hands. - And do what? - I don't know. Expose her? I think the best plan is to just avoid her. Did you want some water? A crazy sociopath, huh? Hmm. Where'd you go? I was thirsty. Hm. Mm. That feels good. I know what you like. What the hell? Come on, big boy. Take matters into your own hands. What did you do to Jenna? I've taken care of her. I loved you, Garrett. I wanted us to be together, - but all you wanted was sex. - That is not true. That's all anybody ever wants from me. Are you okay? So while we can spend countless hours reviewing sales trends, running focus groups, and analyzing surveyed data, the bottom line is when it comes to sex, the one thing that matters is your pleasure and mine. So for this Valentine's Day, forget the flowers, trash the truffles, and skip the sexy negligee, buy me something that will really put a smile on my face. It's great work, Jenna. The client's gonna love that approach. Thank you for being here this morning. I really appreciate it. What're you doing this afternoon? Going to look at office space. Dinner later? Give me a call when you're done. - Oh. - I'm so sorry. That's fine. No harm, no fowl. I'm Sidney, the new intern. Yes, you are. Yeah, it's my first day. I'm the new intern, Bridget. Yeah, but if I knew how good I had it back then, we'd still be together. I'm just saying, you should watch your back. Garrett, a word in private. It's really vibratey. You mean, vibrating dick. Right on. You almost ready. And who'd want to kill him? I'm Sydney, the new intern.
