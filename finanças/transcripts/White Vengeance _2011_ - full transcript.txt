My Lord! Yu, kill Liu Bang now! Watch out, Lord! I have said that earlier There is only one winner on battlefield Today god has put us together Which means there is only one of us can survive Don't blame me, Liu bang My Lord Stop! King Huai of Chu's decree! His majesty spares Liu Bang's life Liu Bang should leave Xianyang immediately and go back to Hanzhong King Huai of Chu has invited eight vassals to Xianyang To celebrate Lord Xiang becoming owner of Xianyang Yafu! Zhang Liang has sent people to kill my counselor You have to kill him So we could call it even, then I'll let you go I can't do that Today, I win. You lose Xiang Zhuang Yes My Lord! Please, don't! Action My lord You are making the biggest mistake Liu Bang you do know how to survive! We have lost our counselor. What should we do? Counselor said that we have to tempt Xiang Yu To a big mistake in order to win I thought we've already lost to Xiang Yu The game is not over yet The real Hongmen Banquet has finally begin Do you know The reason why Liu Bang by keep you beside him? He is using you as a bargaining chip | always choose to believe in others Just like you said you liked me when we first met Even though Liu Bang overstepped his authority He brought me my lute back l was thinking I could sing Chu songs to you again If you still have trust me Sir Yu, Mr. Zhang's wound hasjust recovered Do you think it's appropriate for him to attend our meeting? I could leave if it's inconvenient Wait! Mr. Zhang has chosen the right Lord to serve I sincerely appreciate your help Now the war is over and your highness Becomes the owner of Qin Palace It is only you to blame if this opportunity is missed You should take the supremacy now What are you waiting for? The world hasjust settled down And we don't yet have a good reason to claim the throne yet Besides, the eight vassals would refuse to obey We still need to wait for right timing If the vassals disobey Why can't I send troops to fight against them? Liu Bang hasjust became the lord of Hanzhong It is uncertain what his moves are If he strikes us by surprise while our army is away We can't fight both ends, and we'll lose Based on lord Xiang's military force We can totally divide the troops Since Mr. Zhang is so knowledgeable How could one conquer the world on his own? Why do you give us such an incomplete plan? I do have a plan Since Liu Bang has conceded his allegiance to you You could order him to invade the vassals Then you could use the vassal's help to kill Liu Bang And be the Emperor Do you still think this is an incomplete plan? Please welcome the messenger from Chu Since Lord Xiang asks us to send the army How can we disobey him? Xiao He, it's a not easy for me to be here Please stay at Hanzhong days. We'll be a good host Bring up the best feast Yes He is the messenger sent by Lord Xiang Treat him nicely Yes! General Serve the dishes now Fan Kuai! Why are you serving the best feast? He's the envoy sent by Lord Xiang Of course we should serve the best If he is sent by counselor Fan Zeng Of course it's alright He has saved my lord in numerous situations My lord owes him a great debt of gratitude However the envoy visiting now is just sent by Lord Xiang There's no need to waste our best feast. Put them away We couldn't fully trust the envoy What does Mr. Zhang think? We should test Fan Zeng again So as not to blame the wrong guy Counselor! Our scout said Liu Bang is sorting out his army I think we should take a preemptive attack To spare future troubles After all, Liu Bang has special amnesty from King Huai of Chu We need to find an excuse to kill Liu Bang King Huai of Chu is always a trouble Why don't we kill him first? You mean killing King Huai of Chu? Didn't you ask me to kill King Huai of Chu during Hongmen Banquet? Yu, times has changed Counselor! Does it apply to your loyalty to our Xiang family too? You are making the biggest mistake! Lord Xiang wants to see you My lord You and your family Have always treated me with respect And listened to my opinions That's all our counselors' want! The fact that you want to see me today Means that you still cherish our relation That's enough for me! All good things must come to an end I want to give you a bag of tips before I go If you experience danger Orthink of me in the future You could open it and have a look! Yafu! Sir Zhang Liang, you are here I know you'll come I can't wait too long My apology! l have pushed the limit too farthis time! Zhang Liang You have made a brilliant move this time I knew you were special during the Hongmen Banguet I can tell you now You arejust like the me when l was young! Don't feel bad for me I've been waiting for an opponent like you my whole life Enemies are like the two sides of a mirror Just like Xiang Yu and Liu Bang, or you and me Don't waste any more time Let's finish the fifth game Sir, sir Sir Zhang Liang. There is a kind of chess game... May | Zhang Liang, a survivor of Han Present to my Lord that the general Should be able to distinguish people's qualities before he learns the art of war Counselor Fan Zeng has served three generations of Xiang family But he was discarded like a homeless dog We all feel bitterly disappointed for this Good birds choose the best trees to rest I will go back to Liu Bang's camp Hope Lord Xiang will make careful decisions So as not to die alone Get the army and horses ready! Let's act now! Yes, my Lord! My lord! Liu Bang is at Hanzhong Based on his army force, even if he has Zhang Liang to assist him He won't be a threat to us as long as we don't act rashly Xiang Bo I know you are kind Even if I don't eliminate Liu today He will eventually eliminate me one day? I said it was all meant to be at the Hongmen Banquet There is only one could survive between Liu Bang and l What if King Huai of Chu stops us again? General Han My Lord Xiang Yu has killed King Huai of Chu People all hate him The eight vassals would like to help me to suppress him. General Han... How many soldiers can my Lord lead at most? Less than 100,000 Then how can you control the eight vassals? How about you? For me, the more the merrier Having completed the mission I need to get what I should deserve It seems like I have underestimated Liu Bang I know I can't stop you from fighting But I'll go through the war with you Stop chasing! 8 vassals have all arrived It'll be too late if you don't leave now! How dare you all try and stop me Please don't go My Lord What's that place in the front of us? It is Wu River. Here's Wu city My Lord! Your ladyship! This is Liu Bang's secret order He has ordered the allies to attack tomorrow He persuades me not to make this unnecessary sacrifice You've surrendered to Liu Bang? | just want peace in the world And good relations between the Xiang Yu and Liu Bang There's nothing I can do now lt's meaningless to stay in this war Success or failure is all depending on an attitude There's only you ,Yu Ji who can persuade Xiangyu to leave I really regret that I haven't held your hand like this more often We could start again Yu Ji We have come to the end Look at this land It will be full of Liu Bang's army very soon l have asked Xiang Bo to take you to a safe place Where no one can find you, including me But you have promised that I could stay with you I think... You should have a second Chance to choose They are here. Prepare to fight This song could beat the morale of Xiang Yu's army Hopefully we could win the battle without killing more lives What are you doing? I want to go home Do you think what you have done will fail Lord Xiang Don't Leave This is the moment when Lord Xiang need us most we can't Leave! I want to go home Go home, go home, go home Anyone who escapes now will be executed! Stop! You've all followed me for many years Even though I'm your lord You are all like brothers to me Today, we are surrounding by enemies All of you don't owe me But I do Please remember All of you will always be my brother Take care and Goodbye! Yafu. You have been with me once I was young and You have always helped me To solving any difficulties and make decisions no matter what Xiang Yu, does it mean. I have to retire So that you could really grow up No one can come in! I had a dream on the way I dreamt of a white haired couple sitting close to each other l envied them and so I walked closer to find out who they are Then I realized I knew them lt's you and me I want you to spend the rest of your life with me I don't want to drag you into this... Just like when we first met I don't want you to get involved Liu Bang must send his envoy to persuade us to surrender Wait until they are eased out We shall start fighting Liu Bang! Xiang Yu, I've been waiting to tell you myself that Only one of us can survive between us You are right. But I'll survive Not you! Both the world and people will be mine! Xiang Yu! We used to be sworn brothers So long as you admit your defeat today I shall let you go back to Jiangdong! Kill Xiang Zhuang Xiang Zhuang My Lord Please lend me your sword I am the only one who can kill him and let him rest in peace I lied to him Yu Ji We'll never be separated again Do you want to be with me? ldo My lord! We found this bag of tips in the camp l've persuaded Han Xin to surrender It is hoped that my Lord could last for a while Wait until for the reinforcement of Han Xin to arrive And save us After winning the battle l have promised to shared Han Xin, Zhang Liang and others Share the world and wealth I shall wait for your order and hope that you will take my advice I could only play the game this way Congratulations to Lord Qi on taking the seal! Xiao He... Xiao He... There's a game called where both sides suffer losses Get away! General Fan cannot proceed How dare you trying to stop me? Where were you all when I fought with your Majesty? Stop! My lord! l... I know what you want to ask They plan to kill me! If I don't kill them They'll kill me! l have to do this l... I still want to say it I haven't met you for a long time I know something is wrong and I'm worried about you Therefore I am here to see you When I left home with you and fight the war I said that I will believe in whatever you said But... I'm not well-educated What you've said and done today l have really confused me! I am the emperor now I can give you whatever you want You are Emperor? Could you take off you imperial robe? Can you do this for me? Stop We have promised to help you in completing this achievement Now... Now I'm not useful to you anymore? Now I'm not useful to you anymore? You have promised us that we could have drinks at home after the war Do you still remember? My Lord, Fan Kuai has to... Fan Kuai has to leave Sir, could you tell us who exactly are you? I'm just a person who likes playing Weiqi Once I had a close friend He hired me to play with another Weiqi master Then, I realised my real opponent is my close friend I won't see the doctor again I thought you were dead! I'm alive because I need to see you I want to ask you Is that the result you are expecting? All these years I'm scared each and every day | feel everything they said is a plot All the food they gave me is poisoned Your Majesty! After your death Which one of prince would succeed your position? I remember Yu Ji has asked me a question once Do you know the cost of going to the banquet? I know going to the Hongmen Banquet Means I need to try my best to guess and trick the other side Who violate the order will be executed The cost is that you'll lose the capacity to trust anyone ln Hongmen Palace l have already built monuments without characters to memorize Those who die because of me Zhang Liang l have no one to trust now Zhang Liang Could you do me one last favor? Now that everything is predestined lt's unnecessary to be stubborn and persistent! Things are hard to predict But you can't mix up right or wrong Today | persist to do one last thing for Yu Ji Yu Ji My Lord Thank you for listening The Hongmen Banquet is finally over I should leave now Sir, where are you going? I'll need to find another master to play Weiqi with And see if a win-win situation is possible Zhang Liang I need to ask you again Do we seriously have to play against each other?
