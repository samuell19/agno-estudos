Yes, when they let me eat. Then, you didn't keep your mouth shut completely. But I didn't let them make a record. In an age of all-out war, casual conversation is not silence. In reflecting on your prison time, you self-criticism must be with your arrest. Right, tell us everything about getting caught. You should be critiquing all your activities up to now. Let's go. Hold on! I'm coming. Lately, I've been thinking about death. They keep saying "self-critique" but I don't always know what they mean. Lately, Mori has gotten really strong. He might be able to pull it off. But I don't think escaping is an option. For the revolution to succeed, we must critique our past activities. We can't be intimidated. In front of Mori and everyone, you've got to change your attitude. I know. My ability to make the leap is being questioned. Take over for me. I'm catching cold. What's up? You okay? I'm scared. I feel like what happened before could happen again. It's alright, Kojima. It won't happen again. I don't want to die. I want to get off the mountain. You can't say that. If they find out, you're in trouble. I don't understand what Nagata and Mori are talking about. What do I do? Its rough, but you have to do self-critique. How do I do it? If we just go through self-critique, we can make a revolution? You're supposed to be undergoing self-critique. What the fuck are you doing? Is this a serious critique? Hey, Kato! Where the hell do you think you are? Kato and Kojima have spoiled the sacred space of the party. We have to destroy the limitations to your self-critique. In order to overcome those limits, we must "beat" them. You'll come to with the self-awareness of a new human, capable of being communist. Leadership means beating. Now is the time to put this leadership into practice. We must forge the party in preparation for all-out war. No objection! Kato, criticize your shameful acts and answer with the necessary reflection! In the opinion report on the December meeting, the point on guns was absent. Do you really have the will to fight in the all-out war? When I was arrested, I criticize myself for not trying to break free. I soiled the sacred space of the party. Listen, this is the revolutionary praxis of self-critique. You need to be more revolutionary! And you called me petit bourgeois! Kojima, you're guilty too. Stand up. Wait, wait, wait. If a man beats her, that won't work, it'll just make her happy. Sugisaki, Kaneko. - Stand up and get to it. - Critique them! No crying! Everyone move aside. Hurry up. Hey, you've got to beat him too. So he undergoes proper critique. Hurry and beat him! You need to do this for your own advance. It hurts, but you've got to stick with it. Think of it as practice for all-out war! Overcome this situation and finish the critique. Show your will. Brother! Critique yourself! Motoshisa! This is helping your comrades. Pummel him! Critique yourself! The demand for Kato's critique is the externalization of self-criticism. But, you were resentful of him calling you petit bourgeois. Your criticism of him was based on individual feelings. This warps the meaning of critique and trivializes his transition to communism. So, you need to critique your own past activities. Ozaki, what is your self-critique for the 12/18 action? Shibano invited you but you didn't go. Had there been one more person, he might not have been killed by the police. How do you critique yourself for that? What would you have done if you had been there? Show us how you would confront the cops! Can someone play the part of the police? - Stand up. - Critique yourself! You're not done yet. This is meaningless. Ozaki, do you have what it takes to do self-critique? Reporting instructions. Tomorrow the RAF will evacuate from here. Toyama... Shindo... and Namenaka will affirm their self-critique and move with us to Harune base. After Uegaki and Yamazaki remove all traces and personal effects. They will gather at Haruna Base. Aoto will contact the revolutionary front in Tokyo. Ah, dumplings, dumplings. That guy has no idea what critique means. If we just leave him, he'll never be able to do it. With Kato, we pummeled his face to instill that reflection, but still, he didn't get it. In demanding critique, we have to make them lose consciousness. For Ozaki's critique, concentrate on the stomach to make him pass out. Ozaki, your spirit needs to be more revolutionary. Hang in there. Work through the critique! Stick with it. You'll be reborn as a soldier of the revolution. Hang in there, Ozaki! Tonight is New Year's Eve, so let's feast. I have something to report before we eat. Ozaki is dead. It was a death of defeat. The communist movement we stake our lives on is a battle he couldn't win. He brought on his own death through defeat. His death does not belong to us. He could not critique his own defeatism and this resulted in his death. We will overcome his defeat. We must greet the New Year with a new commitment to advancing. Let us be thankful for our food. Ozaki had been Sakaguchi's junior at Tokyo Fisheries University. Dec 31, 1971: Mitsuo Ozaki, 21, dead I criticize myself for failing to notice the scratches on the guns. With such negligence, can you fight the all-out war? What is your self-critique for letting Mochibara get away and putting the party in danger? Stand up. Be strong. Shindo, it's for the revolution, critique yourself. Make yourself a communist. Shindo, your critique is called for! Why are you doing this to me? Is this really... necessary... for the revolution? You must consider the reasons on your own. You must undergo self-critique! Hey, Toyama. Namekata! Is your critique over? If so, you should be able to do this too. Go ahead! C'mon, hurry. It's for Shinoda. What was your critique at Arakura base? You do it too! Go ahead! I can't do it. What did you do at Arakura? When did you change clothes? Why do you come up to the mountain? To worry about how you look? You haven't completed your critique! Reactionary. I thought you were a revolutionary soldier. Shindo was arrested at Yasuda Hall at Tokyo University in January 1969. After being released, he organized day laborers in Tokyo and Yokohama before joining the RAF. A member of the unit that plotted Plan M, he didn't follow Mori's instructions. He had Mochihara escape to avoid execution. Jan 1, 1972 : Ryuzaburo Shindo, 21, dead Kojima had been a junior of Terabayashi's, joining the RLF to fight the security treaty. She had been Yoshitaka Kato's lover. She had always regretted participating in the executions of Haiki and Mukaiyama. Jan 1 : Kazuko Kojima, 22, dead I'm back. I've brought a couple comrades. Excuse me. Long time no see. How's it going? Where's Shindo? Don't just sit there. Say something! Your statements are no self-critique. Do you really have the will for critique? You being a founding member of the RAF has no bearing here and now. I don't want to wind up like Kojima. I don't want to die. I want to live. But, I just don't understand how to self-critique. You don't understand anything. Saying "I want to live" is an abandoning of revolutionary thought. A defeat with regard to communism. To give yourself to party-building as a communist is the only meaning of "living". Critique yourself! What do you think of yourself? This is why you're messed up. Do you know what is means to become a communist? Don't go using coquetry as a weapon. Have Toyama do critique by burying Kojima I'm gonna do self-critique all the way, and be a solider for revolution! I'll endure the agony. So, give me more trials. I won't give up. Take a good look at Kojima's face! It's the face of defeat. Even after death, she's anti-revolutionary. I carried the body because I had to overcome my fear of death in order to become a revolutionary soldier. With this, I've taken one step closer. That's not what I'm asking! Are you capable of critiquing yourself? Let's see you hit yourself. Yes, I'll do it. Show me how you do critique without help from your comrades. Strike those proud lips! Crush that naughty nose! Aim for those leering eyes! No resting! Keep going until you finish the critique! You can't be soft! Go ahead and take a look at that face boys found so charming. Please let me go to the bathroom. Please let me go to the bathroom. Dirty slut. Yoshitaka...? My brother... Anyone who could do this is beyond hope. This isn't revolution. Among the RLF, only Kato and Maezawa opposed the executions of Haiki and Mukaiyama. It's so cold... Can someone undo the rope... Nevermind... it's ok like this. My hands... my hands hurt... Someone... cut off my hands. Don't cut them... Mom, I'm going to do it. Mom... Mom... I'll persevere. Just wait... I'll make you so happy. I won't give up, mom... Shut the fuck up! Jan 7: Mieko Toyama, 25, dead Jan 9: Masatoki Namekata, 22, dead Namekata had been arrested at the barricades of Tokyo University and joined the RAF after his release on bail. Becoming a communist... is not a question of your record in past struggles. It must be judged by becoming a communist and forming a new revolutionary party to begin the war. The RAF has critiqued those whose consciousness was lagging. The communist movement develops through multiples enduring junctions requiring proletarian loyalty and humanity. In order to advance this movement. Without more effort than the six who died of defeat, we cannot win. I want each of us to examine our actions, to sort out our tasks. Does your silence mean there are no problems with your actions? Truly, can all of you become communists? To win the revolution, each party member must undergo self-criticism. You must all squarely face your own tasks. And critique deeply. If I continue like this, I will never become a communist. Since I had sexual relations with Mukaiyama who was executed last year. And unless I critique what happened with Watanabe in prison, I cannot become a communist. Is that all? When I met with the above-ground members, I used collection money to buy pants. Also, when I went down, I got a perm in Takasaki. Mori, Otsuki here is a second Toyama. Let's have her do a proper critique. Fine. We need to resolve the Toyama problem within the RLF. Anything else? No one? I heard Kaneko say "This is meaningless" during the critique of Ozaki. And Kaneko split from Yoshino. She's trying to claim the child in her belly is her own instead of the party's. Do you have any points for inspection? I have thought about pushing Nagata aside and becoming a top leader in the party. What is your self-critique? I criticize myself for trying to make use of the organization. You tried to use us, to make the organization your property. You're a Stalinist! I sentence you to death. Teraoka was sentenced not to self-critique but to die. He was one of the highest members of the RLF. He supervised the raid on the gun shop and the executions of Haiki and Mukaiyama. I want each of us to reflect on the execution of Teraoka. Yamazaki, why were you standing behind everyone else during the execution? Because I have the same issues and thought I might be executed too. What do you mean? Honestly, I've also been calculating at times and used people. Iwata and Nakamura escaped! Yamazaki. You're a Stalinist just like Teraoka. I sentence you to death! Yamazaki, like Teraoka, received a "death sentence". Yamazaki was a member of the central army, and executed Plan M. His early education was in Germany and he attended Tokyo's famed Hibiya High School. Jan 20: Jun Yamazaki, 21, executed Now, with the party endangered by those two anti-revolutionaries an even deeper critique will be necessary to become a revolutionary soldier. Kaneko, your self-critique lately seems to have weakened. Having a baby in your belly is no excuse to relax. What to you think of Mori? I think he's someone with cute eyes. What the hell do you mean cute eyes! You have no respect for the leader! Do you think you can become a revolutionary like that? You need a stronger critique. Otsuki, you said you had a relationship with that deserter Mukaiyama. It was to get information from that traitor... Hiding your relationship all along is a reactionary act! I'm back. I'm Okusawa. Nice to meet you. Let's go for it. Jan 26: Kasho Base, Gunma Prefecture Why didn't you stop the car like you were ordered? I think my judgment was correct in that case. Can't you follow party orders? You must undergo critique and forge yourself anew! Yamamoto quit his job and gave his retirement money to the RLF. He brought his wife and child to the mountain. Jan 30: Junichi Yamamoto, 28, dead Otsuki had been a RLF activist longer than anyone but Nagata. She was the lover of Watanabe, who had been wounded in the Police Station attack. She died one week shy of her 24th birthday. The car is fixed. Oh, both of you went to public baths? Yeah, we had some time while the car was being repaired. Just the two of you went on your own? What were you thinking doing something like that. Critique yourself! Was it bad to let Okusawa in? That's not the problem. Why the fuck are you talking like that, like you're privileged! Otsuki, Sagisaki and Kaneko Feb 4: Michiyo Kaneko, 23, dead were known as "The Blossoming Trio of Yokohama University". Kaneko had been 8 months pregnant. The father of her child was Masakuni Yoshino. Can you break everything down at Haruna base, Sakaguchi? I leave it to you from here. What happened? Feb 6: Yasuko Yamamoto escaped The cops might come. I'll fight. What are you going to do? Gimme a gun. I'm fighting too! Warn those breaking down Haruna base of the danger. We'll regroup at a cave on Mt. Myogi. It's on the map here. Feb 7: Torayshi Meazawa escaped Feb 12: Mt. Myogi If I could advance the revolution by dying I would gladly be killed! Where is the revolution? Why don't you self-critique? Yamada, who chaired the Bund in Kyoto, was close to RAF chair Shioni. Debilitated, he convalesced in the hospital before returning as a soldier in Mori's RAF. Feb 12: Takashi Yamada, 27, dead Apart from the three defectors, everyone's moved to Mt Myogi. Yamada died there, in defeat. Listen, Sakaguchi. I'm leaving you for Mori. From the communist perspective it's the right thing to do. I understand. I've been relying on you for my thought and I want to break away. I critique myself for being married to the kind of woman I couldn't bring to the mountain. I think being together with Nagata is the correct thing to do. If I don't think like this I'll never become a communist. I'll tell my wife as soon as possible. I have a kid too. My wife will cry but... Can you let me talk to Nagata alone for a minute? I do love you. That kind of language is no longer permissible. What do you think of critique? As the battle with the ruling powers intensifies we all must be communists to advance the revolution. I've lost track of the meaning of critique. I still don't know why Mori sentenced Teraoka to die. He was a factionalist, he might have escaped or informed. He lacked the qualifications to be a revolutionary. Fine, enough... I'm going back. You're ok, right? Sakaguchi... It's Uegaki. They found out about Haruna base. We've gotta move quick. Even if we destroy the armed enemy, the unarmed enemy remains! Even if we destroy the armed enemy, the unarmed enemy remains! We must root out enemy toxins and our own impurities! We must root out enemy toxins and our own impurities! Revolutionary war is the antidote! Revolutionary war is the antidote! Run! Run! Your boots are ruined. I'll give you one of mine. If we live to meet again, give it back. I'll return it twice over. Goddammit it. Put the radio on. This morning in the mountain of Gunma prefecture extremists Hiroko Nagata and Tsuneo Mori were arrested. She was a leading activist of the RLF. Police are searching the area for more members in hiding. Last night, two other suspected members were arrested. Their relation are under investigation. A planner of the gun shop raid last February Nagata was wanted by the police. According to police investigation, the RLF joined with the RAF, who had executed the Yodogo hijacking their movements have been under watch. I repeat... That's enough. Tomorrow morning we form two groups and break out. Alright, here we go. - See ya. - Be careful. Feb 19, 1972: Uegaki, Aoto, Terabayashi and Ito are reported by citizens and arrested Go, keep going. A little further. Damn. Don't stop. Don't stop! Keep going, faster! Don't give up. Don't give up. Get out of here. Motohisa, don't give up! Keep going, don't look back! A little more! Mt. Asama, Nagano Prefecture Here, drink this. We're the revolutionary army. We're sorry, but we have to occupy this place. We intend you no harm. But please remain quiet. Is anyone else here? We have some guests, but they're out skating. When will they be back? Around 6. Anyone else? My husband. Now, he's walking the dog. Pull up the tatami floor. I'm really sorry, but I have to tie you up. What do we do now? For now, let's recover our balance. No objection. Hello? Ma'am? Are you there? It's okay. This is the chief of police of Karuizawa. You students in the lodge are surrounded. There is no way to escape. Stop shooting, dammit! Discard your guns and come out. The manager's wife has nothing to do with this. Let her go immediately. We are communists. Our goal is to overthrow the powers that oppress the masses for capitalists' profit. We're fighting for the revolution to end war and inequality in the world. Think of this as something like protesters seeking help from civilian homes to escape police during demonstrations. So, you are not a hostage. We are just borrowing this lodge from you. Let's hold a meeting to decide on a plan. We won't get anywhere like this. We should shoot our way out of the siege. Impossible. The lodge is surrounded by many layers. I think shooting our way out is impossible too. If we take her, we might be able to escape. The cops can't make any careless blunders. Where could we go? The cops will be after us forever. Let's take her hostage and demand the release of Mori and Nagata. The cops will never go for that. It's useless to launch some suicidal breakthrough missions. We fight an absolute war of resistance here. If so, then we don't need her. We can release her right now. No way! Her presence gives us an advantage to continue the resistance. We're fighting a towering enemy, our only option is to exploit their weakness. With their fake calls for democracy, superficially they have to uphold human life. So, her protection for now is our best tactic. It is permitted for this strategic confrontation. The plan is to fight a war of resistance while protecting her. Is everyone okay with that? No objection! We have enough food supplies to fight for about a month. We conserve from today, and make rice porridge. No objection. We are now in a war of position. Don't waste bullets. No objection. No objection. Ma'am, I'm very sorry. Haven't you made enough disturbance. Let the woman go! I'll take her place if you want someone. Please come out. She's aged so much... Masakuni, if you're there, please listen. I understand how you all feel. But aren't your actions contradicting your words? Why did you quit university? Wasn't it to sacrifice yourself for the good of society? Release the woman! That's true courage. Using our parents, damn. What dirty bastards! My folks ran a flower shop where I grew up. It's the countryside they'll be ostracized for sure. My old man... He'll probably have to leave the company. Nixon shakes hands with Chinese leaders. Later, with Henry Kissinger... Unbelievable... What'll happen to "anti-American patriotism"? Masakuni, President Nixon's gone to China. We've entered a new age. So, throw out your guns and come out. The police say they won't shoot if you come out. Nagata and others were caught, but they're unhurt. Ma'am, are you injured? I don't know how to apologize, I'm so sorry. Son, can you shoot at your own mother? Sakaguchi, some strange guy is at the front door. Red Army members! I'm an intellectual. I understand your feelings. I'm coming to replace the woman. I'm on your side. I've left my wife and kid behind and come from Niigata. So, please let me in. Go back! Or I'll shoot! Student in the lodge! He's a civilian, not a police officer. Don't shoot. I repeat, he's not a police officer. Don't shoot. Feb 22: Masaniko Tagawa, 30, bar owner, is shot. He died a week later. You are completely surrounded. Throw out your guns. Come out immediately. If you have any conscience, show us the woman. Stop shooting. Please come out with the hostage. Your parents are worried. Bring the hostage and come out. Please! Stop firing! Reporting the latest news... The stalemate continues at Asama Mountain Lodge. The Nagano police plan to send in an armed squadron to break off the stalemate. Prior to this, the Commissioner General has announced that they will continue to use discussion and persuasion... How's it going, Motohisa? There's no movement. The power's cut. We've arrested all your peers. Throw out your guns and come out. It's just sounds. They're just playing a tape to rile us up. Sweetie! Are you ok? You aren't cold? Everyone's here, hang in there. We're all waiting for you to come back. Sis, everything's okay. Just stay patient a little longer. You'll get out soon, hang in there. All of you listen, please return my daughter. I think you've accomplished your goals. So, please, let my daughter go. I want to set everyone at ease. Even just a minute, let me stand on the balcony. Even a phone call would be ok. Please, let me call. I just want to tell them I'm ok. The police already know you're ok. They're using bugs. They're having your family speak to manipulate public opinion. I know it's tough, but just bear with it. Be strong. Because everyone's with you. I've done everything I could for you, you're my reason for living. We really understand you all want to make the world better. Even the police praise you. But if you hurt someone, you'll get hurt yourselves. We'll wait all day and tomorrow too. Just come out. Let's go home and eat a meal together. They're here! You're completely surrounded. Give up your guns and come out. All your friends are arrested. Release the hostage and come out. Today during the operation, Bando ate more than his ration. This as a major violation or military codes during all-out war. Self-criticism is required. No, during the operation, a certain degree of autonomy is permitted. Provided this results in no serious effect, we should allow individual judgments on food supplies. Have we not sought our comrade's self-critiques in the name of revolutionary discipline? That very cookie you ate is an anti-revolutionary symbol. This is wartime. We're fighting an enemy. Finally fighting the real enemy! This is idiotic. There's no such thing as anti-revolutionary cookies. How can you face your comrades? Criticize yourselves. Why have we come this far? Point your guns at the enemy. We're comrades! Bando, just criticize yourself and all will be fine. I criticize myself for eating snacks during duty. I will preserve revolutionary discipline from here on. I will strengthen group bonds. I will fight through to the end of the all-out war! From their movements, it looks like the police will storm the lodge soon. I want to make your position clear. The ruling powers only know how to solve problems by applying more force. The battle is about to get much more severe. But we will never hurt you. This much I promise. We are here to fight the police. So we have no intention to use you as a hostage. We will not ask you to be our ally. But neither do we want you to go with the police. We want you to remain neutral. The police talk like they're concerned about your safety but we are their target. They won't think anything of sacrificing a civilian. Their real aim is to steal our social consciousness and our political goal of revolution. The police have known all along that you're safe. In order for us to fight the police, we want you to stay neutral. If they use the tactic of force, we will do everything we can to protect you. What do you mean by fighting with the police? We mean to start a revolution. Revolution? We will radically remake Japanese society. Even you don't think Japan is okay as it is, do you? Whatever happens... can you promise us neutrality? Promise you neutrality? Standing neither with the police nor with us. If you just remain the inn manager, that's fine. But I have one request. If this goes to trial, don't call me as a witness. Okay, I promise. Thank you. Feb 28, 1972 This is the chief of police with an announcement for the criminals in the lodge. It's not too late. Don't compound your crimes. Free the hostage, discard your guns and come out! If you're willing to talk, stand with the hostage in a place where the police can see you, with a white rag. The police won't wait any longer! I'll warn you again. The battle is here at last. It's either victory or death for us. If we die, we can probably meet in the other world. I'm glad the all-out war isn't tomorrow. Otherwise, our death anniversary would only come every 4 years. This is a message from the Chief of Police. You've ignored multiple warnings and continued with your brutal crimes. Soon, to save the hostage, officers will use force. This is your last chance. Discard your weapons and stand in a visible place with a white rag. We are now going to use force to rescue the hostage. Cease your useless resistance. We are now going to use force to rescue the hostage. I wish our comrades could have been here for this meal. Our battles inherit their spilled blood. Our debt... is to our fallen comrades. Let's pay back the debt. We'll pick up the pieces. What the fuck are you talking about? Now of all times? How are you gonna pick up the pieces? Not one of us had any courage! Not you either Not you either Sakaguchi! Not you either! You're a Stalinist! I sentence you to death. You had no courage! I had no courage... We had no courage! Give up! You bastard! Get the guns! Use the handcuffs! Feb 28, 1972: Hiroshi Sakaguchi arrested Kunio Bando arrested Masakuni Yoshino arrested Michinori Kato arrested Motohisa Kato held as a minor 1635 riot police mobilized Two police officers and one civilian killed. 27 injured Weapons used by police: 3126 tear gas canisters, 326 smoke bombs, 96 rubber bullets 83 flares, 15.82 tons of water.
