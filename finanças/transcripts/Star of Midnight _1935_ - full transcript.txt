Just drive down State Street. I'll tell you where later. Alice, can't you at least tell me where you're going? It's business, darling. Don't worry. I'll either call you or be back by half past 10:00. Give me miss Markham, please... Alice Markham. No, Markham! Markham! "M" like in... Like in "Minneapolis". Well, that's absurd! She couldn't have checked out! I was... hello? Hello? Telegram, Mr. Winthrop. Oh, thank you. That was in Chicago over a year ago. It's driving me crazy, Dal. I can't find a trace of her anywhere, And I've got to find her. I won't believe she's dead. She's probably married and settled down and has eight kids by now. Oh, I beg your pardon. That was only a year ago, wasn't it? Oh, be serious, Dal. I'm asking you for help. Nothing doing. I've got enough trouble with my own women. No cocktails, Swayne. - No, sir? - No. Very good, sir. Don't you understand, Dal? I'm still in love with her. But, Tim, I'm not a detective, and I don't want to be. I'm a lawyer and a very good one. Just because I happen to have more fun. Solving cases than trying them, My friends all seem to think that I'm a combination of Charlie Chan, Philo Vance, and the Sphinx, all rolled in to one. Yeah, but you help so many people out of scrapes. That's the least you could do for a friend. Well, I'll tell you what I'll do. If, in my communings with the spirits, astral or liquid, I receive any message or omen, I'll let you know. - How's that? - Thanks, Dal. What makes you think she's in New York? Oh, I don't know. Seems to me that if I wanted to lose myself, New York would be the easiest place to do it in. You've been reading too much O. Henry. Now, I said no cocktails, Swayne. You know we're dining at the Corey's. Yes, sir, quite. But if I might suggest... We're having cocktails, Tim. Yes, sir. I-I think it best. The gin at the Corey's is not, uh, authentic. Thank you, Swayne. Why the third glass? Miss Mantin phoned, sir, and said that she'd stop for you on her way to the Corey's. I was afraid of that. You'll like this kid, Tim, She's quite a character. I've known her since she was 10. She ran away from home when she was 11. They found her in my apartment. She announced that she had decided to marry me. I'll be careful of her. You could go a lot further and do a lot worse. It's Mr. Tennant, sir, returning your call. Hello, Tennant. I thought we'd agreed that my name wasn't to appear in your column anymore. Your name's news, Dalzell. Well, I never bit a dog in my life, and I don't want my name in your column again, is that understood? Wait a minute. Mary, get the Mantin story. Hold the line, will you? All right. Hello, Swayne. Hi, Dal. Hiya, Mantin. Donna Mantin, Tim Winthrop. How do you do? Delighted to meet any friend of Dal's. You must come and see us often when we're married. Tim, the woman is a shameless hussy. And a fact distorter. Have a drink. Thanks. Yes, I'm still here. Here's my lead for tomorrow. "Bad news for New York debutantes. "Clay Dalzell will quit playing the field. To be led to the altar by Donna Mantin." Where'd you get that? Some dame called up and gave it to me. Is it true? Wait a minute. Did you tell Tommy Tennant that we were gonna be married? Certainly. Hmm. Well, you can't get ruled off for trying. There's not a word of truth in it. Okay, then I can use this... "Donna Mantin, wealthy young socialite, "Was seen having tea with Jim Kinland, "Alleged public enemy number 3, yesterday afternoon. What does this TNT for two mean?" You can't print that. Why not? Because I'll trade you a better one. Well, listen to this anyway. Your hunch about my connection with the Van Duzen divorce case is right. You're a white man, Dalzell. The story's dead. Anything else on your mind? Yes. Cut your throat... An honorable ending to a risky career. Swayne, more cocktails. And make them strong. Dal, may I have a few words with you... Privately? If you'll excuse us, Tim. The lady has no manners. Well? Dal, I need help. I'm in a jam. I know... Kinland. - How did you know about that? - Tennant. I just managed to kill the story. Keep on. You'll get yourself splashed all over the front pages. I know, I should have thought about that. Well, how about starting to do a little thinking now? Well, that's just what I am doing. You see, there are some letters. Oh, I get it. Good old Dal... He can get the letters back from the nasty gunman... and get killed doing it, probably. Oh, no, you won't, Dal. You're too smart. Yes? If I were, I'd boot you out of here right now, let you do your own worrying about your letters. Dal, please. Mm. Say, mind you, if I do go into this, I'm only doing it because of your mother. She's a nice woman. Must be terrible for a woman to have a daughter like you. My mother just adores me. She'd be more to the point if she spanked you. I have a mind to do it myself. Well, this will be new. Well, you asked for it. Hey, that hurt! He really does love me. He just kicked me. A sure sign. Oh, Swayne, uh... Get Mr. Kinland on the phone for me, will you? - Mr. Jim Kinland, sir? - That's right. Don't you think Dal ought to marry me, Mr. Winthrop? I'd have lots of money. And I'd have lots of headaches. Always belittling. Why don't you tell the man the truth? When I was 10 and he had a mustache, he said I was his sweetheart and he'd wait for me to grow up. And now... I shaved off the mustache. Mr. Kinland is not at home, sir. Oh. Well, you leave word for him to call me, just as soon as he comes in, either at the Corey's or at the Prince Theater later. I'll leave my seat number at the box office. - Are we going to the theater? - Yes, ma'am. Say, Tim, have you seen this Mary Smith? No, but I want to. Does she wear that mask all the time? Well, I don't know. They say she's never seen around the theater without it, and after the show, she just disappears into the night. Now, there's something to conjure with. Now, a woman like that captures the imagination... - Mysterious... - Mysterious, my eye. Your masked marvel probably has a wart on the end of her nose. Meow. To the mysterious Mary Smith. Kinland? My apologies to the hostess. Oh, Dal, don't go. I didn't realize what I was asking. Stay here. Give my love to Mary Smith. Tell her I went to my death with a smile on my face. I tell you, Ohlman, I can do you a lot of good. You're in bad company, Abe. Hiya, Dalzell. How's business? Capacity, night after night. That Smith girl is something every producer dreams about. Yes. If it wasn't for these newspaper fellas coming in, Asking foolish questions all the time, why... Well, we know something that they don't know, hmm? Clay! Well, bless me. Jerry. You haven't forgotten me. What do you mean? You've heard me speak of Clay Dalzell, dear. Oh, yes. How do you do? Oh, how do you do, Mr. Burton? Oh, no, my dear. I divorced Mr. Burton four years ago. Since then, I've been Mrs. Crandell and... Oh, I'm so sorry, Mr. Crandell. No. I'm now Mrs. Classon. This is Mr. Classon. Oh. Don't be embarrassed, Mr. Dalzell, I run into that sort of thing all the time. Well... That Dalzell never turned a hair. Why should he? That's Roger Classon, the Chicago lawyer, and his wife. Well? - She and Dalzell were once... - Oh. We're at King Charles. Do look us up. - I'll do that. - Good night. - Good night, Jerry. - Good night. Good night, Mr. Crasson... Uh, Clandell. Uh... - All right? - Very good, sir. I'll tell Mr. Kinland you're here. Thank you. - You Dalzell? - Yeah. - I'm Jimmy Kinland. - How do you do? What's on your mind? Miss Mantin asked me to get some letters from you. Beat it. When I get the letters. Beat it, I said, while you're still healthy. Very well. Oh, uh, by the way... There was something funny that I wanted to ask you about. In 1929, you made a total-gross income-tax return of $65,000. What's that to you? But you were given one check alone for $120,000. Actual total-gross income... $970,000. How many pennies am I off the exact figure? Radio is awfully loud. I want it that way. Oh. Where did you pick up that tax deal? From the man who paid you the $120,000. The canceled check is in my safety-deposit vault, where the police will find it if anything happens to me. That check is six years old, why'd you hold out till now? I'm not a Federal man. How much do you want? The letters. There's lots of things we don't like that we have to take. The reason I'm alive today is because I'm smart enough to know when to take it. Here you are. Thank you. Good night. Oh, wait a minute. What about the check? Oh, I'll keep that, if you don't mind. You can trust me. It ain't exactly business, is it? Strictly business. That check is the lock that keeps the Mantin matter a closed book. And we closed it just in time. I have to stop Tennant from printing a story about you and the lady. He's too nosy, that guy. Maybe he ought to be rubbed out. Isn't that sort of thing, uh, against the law? Flash from the News-Radio Bureau: The Prince Theater tonight was thrown into confusion at the end of the first act, when Mary Smith, the star of "Midnight", suddenly disappeared. We will now return you to Nick Price and his orchestra. Well, there's a story for Tennant. The mysterious Mary Smith disappeared, Or kidnapped, maybe. What do you know about that? I don't know anything about it! Now, I was here all night, and I can prove it! My friend, the question was purely academic. Good night. Sleep tight. Swayne. Swayne, I want a drink. Swayne... There's someone at the door. "I'm very sorry, Mr. Dalzell. I'll attend to it immediately." Dal, I found her! I found her! Good. But it's a worse mess than ever, she's disappeared again. My boy, you're not in love with a girl, you've fallen for a card trick. But you don't understand. Alice is Mary Smith. And you're Mahatma Gandhi, and there's the brandy. How's that? But she is, Dal! She is! I realized it the moment she stood on the stage. The minute I saw her, I shouted, "Alice!" That must have helped the show along. She see you? Well, she must have. She got all upset. She had to start her number over again. No, thanks. I waited till after the act was over, and then I rushed backstage to see her. She'd already gone, huh? Yes. People were chasing each other around... Detectives, newspaperman. Then someone spotted me as the fella that had shouted "Alice", so I beat it. Timothy, I can't work out a jigsaw puzzle if you're going to keep some of the pieces in your pocket. What do you mean? I mean that you haven't told me all you know or at least suspect about her disappearance from Chicago. Now, how about it? Do I get the other pieces? Well, I... Could anyone have followed you? I don't know. Perhaps you better go into my den and wait. Right. Ah, brother Tennant. Where's Winthrop? Well, if it's off the record, he was at the Prince Theater seeing "Midnight". There isn't anyone seeing "Midnight". - The Smith girl has disappeared. - No. Disappeared and given me the greatest story a newspaperman ever had. - Have a drink. - Thanks. How's this for a setup? The show's going on, lights blazing, music blaring, the girls dancing their heads off. Smith makes her entrance. A guy in the third row jumps up and yells, "Alice!" Smith almost drops in her tracks. She has to start all over again. A guy races up the aisle and through the lobby, and I'm right behind him. And what's more... I stay right behind him. I tell you, Dalzell, this is sheer drama. That girl had to wear a mask. Then it wasn't just publicity? No. In your wildest dreams, you could never imagine the real reason. This is the story of the year, and I'm cracking it. Well, that's swell, but where do I come in? I'm gonna play ball with you, Dalzell, and I want you to play ball with me. I'll tell you everything I know, but you've got to do the same. Yes, but I don't know anything. Okay, I'll take a chance. Look, I trailed this guy and picked up plenty. Mary Smith is not really Mary Smith. Her name's Alice Markham. She comes from a little jerkwater town in Ohio. She disappeared from Chicago about a year ago. Just as completely as she did tonight. Tennant, I apologize, you're good. Where'd you pick up all this? That's nothing. I found out. The greatest double cross that's ever been pulled. This guy was pretending to... Tim. Tim? Stick 'em up! Higher! Turn around! What's the matter, sir? Where have you been? To the theater, sir. Come in here. What's happened, sir? Tommy Tennant's been shot. Some brandy, Swayne. Never mind, Swayne. Uh, get me Police headquarters, please. Are you hurt, sir? Only grazed, I think. Who did it? I don't know. Uh, let me have, uh, inspector Doremus, please. "Acme arch supporters will give tired feet new life. "And take away that pain almost immediately, Or your money back." Inspector Doremus. Huh? Murder? What's that address? Yeah. Yeah. Now, listen, don't touch a thing. I'll be right over. Can you picture that? Tommy Tennant's been plugged. Tommy Tennant? Yeah. Fulton, I want you to go to Tommy Tennant's office at the Star, start pumping his secretary, and find out everything you can about him since he cut his first tooth. He's been bumped off. Franklin, you go with him. Your job is to find out where he was and what he did every minute of the day until the murder. Brady and Jones, you're to snoop around Tennant's apartment, see what you can see. Now, beat it, all of you. Wait a minute, Lewis, Cleary, you're to come with me to Clay Dalzell's. That's where the body is. Get a party to come along for fingerprints and also notify the Coroner's office. Okay, inspector. And, Lewis, you're to go to 125 West 34th street and get me a pair of acme arch supporters. Right. Okay. I don't think the hip will trouble you a bit. Good. I'm very much obliged to you, doctor. You're welcome. Just a few more questions, Mr. Dalzell. So long, doc. See you at the inquest. Good night, doctor. Good night. Good night, gentlemen. You're something of a criminologist, ain't ya? Well, I've read all of Edgar Wallace. Doesn't it strike you kind of funny that the murderer left his gun behind? Do murderers usually do that? This one did. Sure that ain't your gun? Quite. My gun is in the cabinet beside my bed, where it always is. It had your fingerprints on it. Naturally, I told you I picked it up. You didn't like Tennant, did you? Not particularly, no. Ever have an argument with him? Frequently. What about? Things he wrote in his column. What was Tennant gonna print in his column about you tomorrow? - Nothing. - How do you know? Because he told me so. No, he didn't. He didn't do nothing of the kind, I'll tell you why, you know. You killed him before he had a chance to do it, ain't that it, Dalzell? Tennant came here to get a story confirmed. You denied it. He didn't believe you, said he was gonna publish it anyhow. You had an argument, he wouldn't give in, and the only way you could stop his printing it was to murder him. Ain't that what happened? You got too much water in that one. Hmm? Oh. Say, what is this... A cross-examination or a band rehearsal? I beg your pardon, sergeant. Let's see. Where were we? Oh, yes. I just shot Tommy Tennant. Well, sergeant, to, uh, continue your interesting, if somewhat amusing, theory, I suppose I shot myself in the hip. Well, that ain't impossible, either! Sergeant, you're right. That ain't impossible either. I'll take it, Swayne. Hello? Where are you? I'm in the Bronx at a pay station. Are you all right? Sure. How'd you get there? I don't know. I was in your den when suddenly two men appeared, before I could cry out, they knocked me cold. When I woke up, I was in Van Cortlandt Park. You've been reading scenarios. What? Uh, listen, I'm, uh, awfully busy right now, really. I'd like to talk more, but I can't. Uh... Oh, no, no, no. I-I wouldn't come up if I were you. It might be embarrassing for you. Uh, just a minute. Sergeant, don't you think you could hear better if you plugged that in? Huh? Give me a ring sometime tomorrow. Or better still, I'll ring you. Good night. Who was that you was talking to? No one you know. I'm afraid we'll have to know, Mr. Dalzell. This is a murder case. I beg your pardon. Do you know Ms. Donna Mantin? Sure. I've seen her picture in the Rotary viewer. You have nice taste. Thanks. You mean you was talking to miss Mantin? Sergeant, I bow to your powers of deduction. Well, I guess that's all for tonight. Come on, Cleary. I'm sorry, Dal. I didn't know you had callers. Gentlemen, this is... Miss Mantin. Inspector Doremus, sergeant Cleary. - How do you do? - How do you do? Come on, Cleary. Wait a minute. Did he say "Mantin"? Nice-looking girl, ain't she? I ain't worrying about her looks. - Dalzell lied. - Sure, he lied. Let's go back and drill him. Look, Cleary, you're a good cop, but you've got to be a lot smarter before you'll make a good detective. What do you mean? You can't break him with words. Words are his business. He's a lawyer. Now, just let him alone and let him do the work for us. Come on. All of which makes me a first-class murder suspect. That's terrible. Poor fellow. And my walking in didn't help you any, either, did it? No. However, I'll overlook that if you'll whip me up a little drink. By the way, there are your letters. Oh, thank you, Dal. I'm really terribly grateful. All right. Don't let me catch you getting mixed up with such people again. Who was really on the phone when I was supposed to be? Well, I suppose I've got to mix my own drink. Answer my question. Hello? Hello, Anita? You can quit worrying, I've got your letters. Oh, that's all right. How? Oh, it was very simple. But you get mixed up with any of that kind of foolishness again, and I'm going to tell your husband. All right. Goodbye, dear. Well, I certainly went for that one, all right. Now, now, boy scout, you did your good deed. - Somebody had to do something for the poor girl. - Oh. Come on. Who was really on the phone before? You know I take more whiskey than that. Dal, I'm not asking to be curious, but don't you see the police have caught you in a lie and it may put you in a spot? I'm already in a spot. Sergeant Cleary insists that I killed Tennant. Did you? No, inspector, I did not. - Well, who did? - I don't know. I've got a hunch, but I'm not sure. Say, this is swell. Home murder mysteries. Why go out for thrills, when you can have them in your own parlor? Come on, who did it? Where were you in the night of the murder? Do you wear a long black mustache? Have you a strawberry mark on your left knee? I refuse to testify. Your hot-water bottle, sir. What's that for... Rheumatism? Oh, no, miss. He was shot in the... Hip. Well, why didn't you tell me? Madam, this is my wound. Swayne, lay out Mr. Dalzell's pajamas and fix the bed. Yes, miss. - Oh, and he better have a hot bath, too! - Yes, miss. This is probably none of my business, but just what do you think you're doing? Staying here to nurse you back to health. Donna... Donna, this... This touches me. No, this is... this is really as nice a gesture as you could possibly make. I-I-I scarcely know how to thank you. I'm almost, uh... Nonplussed. Where are we going? We're not going anywhere. You're going home! Good night, Mantin. Dal! Dal, you big bully! I'll get even with you for this! Eh! Swayne! Orange juice. Coffee. Don't spare the horses. Good morning... Or, rather, good afternoon. What are you doing here? I thought I kicked you out last night. Oh, that's all right. We nurses are used to our patients' eccentricities. They often get violent. Haven't you been home? Were you here all night? Certainly. You know me... the Florence Nightingale of Park Avenue. How's your, uh, shoulder? Splendid. How's yours? Well, I guess I brought that on myself. Which would you rather have first... coffee or bandages? Coffee. What? Two lumps of sugar and a dash of bitters... oh, cream. What a sap you were to sit up all night. Who sat up? I slept in Swayne's bed. What? Swayne tried the divan. He reports it's none too comfortable. Your parents will be utterly charmed by all this. Oh, I told them I was here. Good girl. Your father's probably on his way over here now. Don't be vulgar. Drink your coffee, you'll need your strength. - Why? - The Police Department awaits without. If you think I'm going to ask "without what?", you're meshugga. All right, all right. Anyway, "without an idea" is the answer. - They been there long? - Oh, yes. We've been discussing the murder, and I've convinced them that you're the guilty man. That's mighty nice of you. Would you ask them to come in? You may come in, gentlemen. He's ready to confess. - Good morning, inspector. - Sergeant. - I must apologize for... - It's okay. We're in no hurry. We want to talk to Mr. Dalzell in private. Oh, by all means. Swayne, we are not to be disturbed. Now... Gentlemen, my head is never quite clear in the morning. Or in the afternoon, either, for that matter, Until I've had my shower. Do you mind? You can ask questions there just as well. It's okay. Oh, that will be fine. We can get everything cleaned up at once. All right, gentlemen, make yourselves at home. - Swell bathroom you got here. - Yeah. Up at my place, the tub and shower's all in one. Those are very dangerous, you're likely to slip in the tub. Yeah, so I found out. You know, we've been doing a little checking up. You'll have to speak a little louder, inspector. Saw quite a bit of Tennant last night, didn't you?! I thought we'd covered all that. Yeah? How about admitting you were at the theater with him. Well, all right, I was at the theater with him. Sergeant, would you mind passing me a cake of soap? Why didn't you tell us? I didn't think it mattered. Thank you. Say, what was in that note you got at the show last night just as the show started? Inspector, I beg your pardon. I've been belittling you... In my mind, I mean. That's okay. What did you say was in the note? I didn't say. Come on, Dalzell! Who was it from?! A friend of mine. Sure it wasn't from Tennant? What? Sure it wasn't from Tennant?! You don't have to shout now. Water's off. I know! I mean, I know. - Would you mind passing me a towel, please? - Sure. No, the note was not from Tennant. Sure it didn't... Sure it didn't tell you to leave the theater and meet Tennant someplace? Well, what would be the sense of that? You just told me that I was talking with him at the theater. You know, I understand the show "Midnight's" a pretty swell show. Yes, so I hear. - Ain't seen it, then? - No. Why didn't you stay last night? Well, I thought I'd rather take a walk. That's why you took a cab? You're quite right, inspector, I have been lying to you. Yes, I know. Most people do. Don't misunderstand me, Mr. Dalzell, we ain't trying to trip you up. Frankly, I don't think you killed Tennant, but your fingerprints were on that gun. Unless you come clean, you're gonna be hooked up with this murder. Inspector... What I'm refusing to tell you has no bearing on the murder of Tommy Tennant. Now, whether or not you choose to take my word for that, of course, is up to you. Well, I guess I'll have to. However, mind you, this may be of no help, but I have a theory. What's that? The murder of Tommy Tennant and the disappearance of Mary Smith are related, in one way or another. Ah, for Pete's sake, the disappearance of Mary Smith is a publicity stunt! We're working on a murder case! Well, that's the only hunch I've got. Well, thanks, anyway. Come on, Cleary. Goodbye, inspector. I'll be seeing you. Oh, yeah, sure. We'll be seeing each other... often. You know, I wonder. What? I wonder what the Tennant killing and the Smith girl's disappearance did have to do with each other. Oh, pardon me. See that guy? Yeah. He's gonna have arch trouble in a couple of years, walking on his heels like that. Don't be so stubborn. What were they asking you? They wanted to know what you were doing here, and so do I. Oh, I could have told them that myself. I'll bet you could. Dal... I had to see you, I couldn't stand it. Oh, hello, Tim. Dal, I had to find out what happened here last night, was it true? - Hello. - Hello. Dal, tell me what happened. Was it really... Nurse, how about a little tonic for your patient? When? When. Sure you're not trying to get rid of me? Oh, Donna. Now, when Swayne leaves us, we'll be alone. Dal, tell me what happened. Why all the mystery? Why can't you tell me what happened? Tim, it's not usual for my guests to take potshots at me, and, frankly, I don't care for the custom. Suppose you explain things. Don't you think you owe me the truth? I have told you the truth. Now, listen, Tim... You're free, white, and 21. You can do as you choose. There's a fellow investigating this case. By the name of Doremus. Although he doesn't look it, he's as smart as a whip. Sooner or later, he's going to find out. Who was in this apartment when Tennant was killed, And he's gonna put two and two together, And when he does, you're gonna be the answer. Now, don't you think it'd be much better if you told me the truth? But, Dal, I tell you... What did you tell Tennant last night after the theater? What are you talking about? I never spoke to Tennant in my life. Then why did you kill him? I didn't kill him, Dal. I don't know anything about it. Dal, you don't think I'd take a shot at you? All right, my lad. You know, they say. The weather is fine in Miami this time of year. Why don't you run down there for a while? Why? You should know the answer to that one. I'm not going anywhere. I'm gonna stay right here and find Alice Markham. All right, Tim. Good luck. Alice, where art thou? Did you ask something, sir? Oh. Yes. Where is Mary Smith? I don't know, sir. No. Of course you don't. It's obvious that there's some connection between the disappearance of Mary Smith and the murder of Tommy Tennant. But what has Tim Winthrop to do with it all? If neither he nor Mary Smith is involved, then why is he lying to me? - I, uh... He said that he never spoke to Tommy Tennant in his life, yet Tennant told me that just after Tim got up and shouted, "Alice", he left the theater. Tennant followed and stumbled on a great story. Now, what's the answer? Did Mr. Tennant specifically say, sir, that he... That's it! Swayne, that's it. Tennant didn't tell me that it was the same man. Tennant followed somebody else! - But that isn't what I was going to say, sir! - Don't quibble, Swayne. Donna! Donna! Coming, sire. Mantin, we're going to solve the disappearance of Mary Smith and the murder of Tommy Tennant, how do you like that? Okay, Sherlock. Where do we begin? At the cab stand of the Prince Theater. I want you to go right down there and check up on all the cabs that left there last night between 9:00 and 10:00. Find out who hired them and where they went. Swayne! You got that clear, Watson? On my way, Sherlock. Swayne, you want to be a detective, don't you? - No, sir. - That's fine. I want you to get Abe Ohlman on the phone and ask him to meet me at the King Charles Bar at 4:00. Then I want you to go to the Prince Theater. And check up on how many men left there last night. During the first act... Who they were, where they went, any other information you can get. Understand? How do I find that out, sir? Swayne, I haven't the faintest idea. Abe... Where did you first meet her? Did she come to you for a job? She did not. I picked her up at the Club Rio. Oh, she was singing there? No. No, she wasn't, she was a guest... Alone, mind you. Out of a clear sky, she jumps up and begins singing while the orchestra's playing. And was she terrific. What do you mean? Without being asked, she just got up and started to sing? Why? I found that out later. She was broke. She blew her last 10 bucks. On a bottle of mums for one good fling. Well, that's not so bad. This mask business... Does she wear it all the time? Oh, no. No, only on the stage. That was her idea. When I offered her a job, she insisted on that condition. So, you signed her up for buttons, huh? Well, I thought I did. I gave her the usual minimum guarantee and a percentage. We haven't had an empty seat. She's been drawing 1,500 bucks a week. Which isn't a bad figure. Pardon. Pardon me. Where does she bank? Search me. She was paid in cash. She wouldn't take a check. Well, that doesn't get us anywhere. Does she have any friends? I don't know. Does she get any mail at the theater? Mnh-mnh. Uh... Did she have any visitors there? No, not what you'd call "visitors". The only one who ever came to see her was Tennant. Tennant? Well, I guess that was professional. That's interesting. Where'd she live? That's one thing I do know. At the Warman. Abe, you're improving. That's something, anyway. Well, I'm sure glad you're interesting yourself in this business. If there's one man in the world can find this girl, it's you. - Now, Abie... - Now, on the levels. Didn't you find that married girl when the rest of the world gave up? That was luck. Well, call it anything you like, but please call me when you find her, will you? Mm. Another drink, Mr. Dalzell? Yes. Make it two... One for miss Mantin. Quiet, you rat. I'm in a disguise. So I see. You just wait till tomorrow. I'm having some beautiful false whiskers made. Yeah? You're gonna be a lot of help on this case. I thought you were checking taxis for me. - I did. - Oh. Oh, the taxi business is picking up. It's, uh... Wait a minute... 20% better this month than it was this month last year. Well, isn't that splendid? I've been getting my information from Frankie Allen. He's number y7229 and is an interesting addition to any social group. Writes poetry. Listen to this: "Life is what you make it. "You can't duck life. You've got to take it. "It don't pay to frown. You've got to grin. "And no matter what happens, just keep your chin... up. "And then you will find in this world full of strife. You come out on the top in this battle of life." Now, isn't that a lovely little... 8 sidecars, 10... There ain't nobody can come in miss Smith's room now. The police are here. It's all right, Belinda. Mr. Dalzell is a friend of the management. He wants to look around a bit. Yes, sir. Thanks, Allen. I'll see you later. The man from headquarters... Where is he? Ain't no "he." It's a she. In there, looking at miss Smith's clothes. All right, Watson, come out. Well, what detained you? Any clues? No, just clothes. Were these all the clothes that miss Smith had? Yes, sir. That's all. Police. Greetings, gentlemen. Hello, miss Mantin. Hello, inspector. Say, what are you doing here? Well, Abe Ohlman asked me to have a look around. Oh. I'm surprised to find you here. Oh, you're likely to run in to me anywhere, Mr. Dalzell. Evidently, my theory about this case did interest you. No. The commissioner's got me running in circles. I was going great on the Tennant case, when he asked me to find an angle on this publicity-stunt disappearance. If you don't mind, Mr. Dalzell, we've got a couple of questions we'd like to ask the maid. Go right ahead. We're, uh, just leaving. Come, Donna. - Goodbye, inspector. - Goodbye. What do you make of all of this, Mr. Holmes? Hey, I told you there was something phony about this. Why did she call him "Mr. Holmes"? Uh, King Charles Hotel. Well, how'd you do? Say, inspector, you ain't taking this case serious enough. That guy Dalzell... He's doing all right, Cleary. He's doing all right. Now, look, you go back and question that maid and find out what he asked her. Hey, where are you going? First I'm going to drop Corbett here at the King Charles bar to shadow Dalzell 24 hours a day, And then I'm going to 125 West 34th street. To sock the guy in the nose that sold me these arch supporters. They're killing me. Go ahead. I'll meet you at the king Charles bar in 15 minutes. Good afternoon, colonel. Good afternoon. I'm interested in Mary Smith. You know anything about her? Yes, sir. That's fine. What? She disappeared from the show last night. After the first act. No. Yes. Life is what you make it. You can't duck life. You've got to take it. But that isn't all I know, sir. What else? Oh. I beg your pardon. She used to leave the hotel. Every morning at 7:45 exactly. And then walk over towards 5th Avenue. Yes? Yes. Well, what else? That's all. You practically solved the disappearance. Practically. I beg your pardon? Keep your trap shut and keep moving. Get in the car. I got your invitation. Sit down. Look, friend, I'm your pal. And if you want me to see that you get a big funeral, okay, But give me the check first. What are you talking about? You're fooling around with some mighty tough people. You? Me? No. I'm one of the nicest fellas you ever met in your life. And these boys are just taking care of you. But there's a couple of other guys on your trail. That are different kinds of people. How do you know that? Look, Dalzell, let's you and me quit kidding each other. Didn't you say if anything happened to you. The law would get that check? And don't that mean that I got to keep you healthy? Well... That's what me and my boys have been trying to do. But it ain't no cinch, with you running all over town, Sticking your nose into a lot of things. That ain't none of your business. Such as? Murders and, uh... Kidnappings. I see. Who did you say these gentlemen following me were? I didn't say. Mm. They mixed up in the Tennant murder? Who do you figure will cop the pennant this year? Well, with the kind of team we've got, I don't think the other fellas stand a chance. Don't be too sure of that. Now, just keep your nose clean, Dalzell. Leave the Tennant murder. And the Smith girl's disappearance. For the cops to worry about. They don't concern you none. There are two different schools of thought on that subject. However, I get your point. Toodle-oo. Coming, boys? What kept you this time? Did you get mixed up with some other woman? Martini, please. Keep it dry, will you? And... Three olives. Oh, hello, madam. Am I an orphan? Two Martinis. I'll take the same... Two Martinis. What did you think of that Mary Smith's room? Hors d'oeuvres, sir? Swell. I'm starved. She must have been a very peculiar girl. You feel like a stuffed egg? Thanks. You know, if I or any of the girls I know. Lived in a hotel room for a week, We would have accumulated so much junk. That it would have taken a maid four hours to get things packed. Fishy? No, Martini. Thanks-y. But not Mary Smith. She was the neat new England type. Why, you could have stripped that room bare. In about three minutes. Say that again. I said you could have stripped that room bare. In about three minutes. What was that for? Mantin, you're a bright girl but dumb. You don't know a good idea when you see it. Listen... Mary Smith had a room at the warman, But she didn't live there. And I'm going home and go to bed. Well, that makes sense. Mary Smith didn't live at the warman, So you're going home to bed. Well, it isn't even 8:00 yet. All my life, I've said good night to the milkman. Tomorrow I'm going to say good morning. Check, please. Come on. I'll take you home. At this hour? I should say not. Clay Dalzell, are you giving me the runaround? Donna, don't you trust me? Yes, but I'm probably wrong. Which proves that you're not so dumb. Have you seen that new trick with the 10? No. Now watch. Well, what's the answer? Eight sidecars. Good night. Now, uh... You better run home. And get a good night's rest, officer, 'Cause we're going to get a very early start in the morning. I'm sorry, madam, but Mr. Dalzell has retired. - Is he sick? - No, madam, he just retired early, that's all. Well, times have changed. Tell him Mrs. Classon is calling, will you? But, madam, I said that Mr. Dalzell... Lovely apartment... Perfectly lovely. Let me see. This must be Mr. Dalzell's bedroom? No, madam. That is his bedroom. Oh, thank you. Who is it? It's Jerry... Jerry Classon. Will you come out, or shall I come in? I-I'll come out! Well... This is a surprise. I expected you to call me at the hotel today. Oh, Jerry, as a matter of fact, I intended to, But I've been so rushed to... Will you have a little drink? No? Strange bumping into you at the theater last night, Clay. Wasn't it? Brought up a lot of old memories, hmm? You know, I've always felt rather badly. That we drifted apart. Well, Jerry, those things happen. Water under the bridge, you know. How are you, anyway? Just the same, Clay. The embers are still... Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. You're Mrs. Classon now. Oh, that. Oh, sorry. What sort of time are you having in New York? Very disappointing. Yeah? I find you treating me like an old friend. The night I go to see the hit show in town, The star disappears on me. I'm frightfully intrigued by it. Tell me, Clay, what happened? Have you any idea why she disappeared, where she is? Search me. Come, now, Clay. It's common gossip that you're looking for her. Are you going to find her? Or have you already found her? Now, Jerry, you're the wife of a lawyer. You should know better. Than to ask a witness leading questions. And what is the meaning of this? I'm sure I don't know. And who is this? I am Mrs. Dalzell. Who are you? So, this is why you bundled me off into the spare room! Your cold was worse! How dare you do such a thing?! And after we've been married for only two weeks, You having a rendezvous with another woman, Me right in the same house! My dear, I assure you... Oh, I'm not blaming you. I know how he is with the women. How could you be so sordid? I knew your past wasn't all that it might have been, And I was willing to forget and forgive... Oh, Donna, for heaven's sake! You're a very silly child, my dear. You'll never hold a husband with this kind of scene. Good night, Clay. I'm sure your marriage is going to be very happy. Oh, it'll be all right, Jerry. Good night. Where did you get that creation? Swayne. And where did you get that woman? Thanks, Swayne. I'll do as much for you someday. All right, boy scout. You've done your good deed for the day. Now, how about tripping homeward? No. Yes. I'm on my way to bed. It's no gag. Not on your life. I'm taking no more chances. No? No. Mr. Mantin, will you please come over here. And get your daughter and take her out of my apartment? And you better bring your shotgun, daddy. We may need it. Dal... What? You really didn't know that woman was coming here? No. I knew it. Now I'll let you get some sleep. How did you know that I wanted to get rid of her? I didn't. Well, anyway, good night. And thanks. Good night, and don't mention it. 7:45. Exactly. Well, I'm all in, inspector. This guy's doing. The first sensible thing he's done all day. He's down here in the king Charles bar having a drink, Which is what I'm gonna do right now. It's funny. I get just so far, then smack... Right into a stone wall. I finally found a bus driver. Who remembered picking up a girl of her description every morning. And taking her to Washington square. What happened after she got off the bus? What do you say we give up this detecting business. And go in for some plain or fancy matrimony? Can't get the thing out of my mind. It's got so many queer angles. What'll it be... a church wedding or a quiet one at home? For instance, how did Jerry, uh, what's-her-name. Know that I was looking for Mary Smith? Do you talk in your sleep? She said it was common gossip. That's ridiculous. 'Cause if you do, I could wear earmuffs. Hmm? Did you say something? No. What's the matter... You tired? Dal, there's a man at the end of the bar. Who's staring at you. I thought I recognized you. How are you, Mr. Dalzell? Oh! Yes, yes, of course. - I hope I'm not intruding. - No, not at all. This is miss Mantin. Mr. uh... Classon. Classon. How do you do? How do you do? - Sit down, won't you? - Oh, thank you. I was hoping I'd find you here. Sorry if I've kept you waiting. I usually get here earlier. Yes. You see, Mr. Dalzell, you and I are both interested in the same woman. We're both trying to find Mary Smith... Or, rather, Alice Markham. Oh. Yes. That's why I sent Mrs. Classon to call on you last night. I was using her as a sort of private detective, though it didn't do me much good. Do you mind telling me why you're so interested in Alice Markham? My best friend is facing the electric chair, Mr. Dalzell, and the only chance I have to save him is to find Alice Markham. Well, that's interesting. John Marone is awaiting trial in Chicago for the murder of Fred Dexter. He didn't commit that murder, Mr. Dalzell, because when it happened, he was in his own apartment, and Alice Markham was with him. And he can't prove that without her. She's his only alibi. If she hadn't disappeared that night, John would be a free man now. Why did she disappear? I don't know why she disappeared in Chicago. Any more than I know why she disappeared in New York. But if it's humanly possible, I'm going to find her and find out. Message for you, Mr. Dalzell. Oh, thank you. Thank you, sir. Pardon me. Uh, do you mind my asking you, uh... how you discovered that Mary Smith was Alice Markham? Well, I wish I had something mysterious to tell you, but it's really quite simple. I attended the performance of "Midnight". You remember. I met you there. Someone stood up and shouted, "Alice!", then, suddenly, everything became clear to me. What did you do, then? I immediately went to the lobby and phoned my partner in Chicago to tell Marone the good news. When I got back to my seat, there was no performance and no Mary Smith. I'm afraid you're a bit of a disappointment to me. Yes, sir. We'd regarded you as a pretty suspicious character. Yeah. Well, seems pretty hopeless but I promise you this... If we, my partner and I, do find any trace of Alice Markham, we'll let you know. That's very kind of you. Dal, we'd better be going. Why? Swayne. All right. Well? Well, sir, there... There seems to have been several people who left the theater during the first act, but I only was able to get an accurate check on one of them. He... he behaved in a suspicious manner and aroused the curiosity of one of the ushers, who happens to be studying to be a private detective... One of those correspondence-school courses. That's the man who left the theater... what about him? Well, sir, he... he got up just after the act started and slipped out of the theater. He stopped in the lobby for a moment and mumbled something about Mary Smith to another man, and then he rushed on out and got into a taxi. That's the man! Did the usher get his name? Does he know where he went? He didn't get his name, sir, but he knows the taxi driver, and he found out where the man went. Well? The usher wouldn't tell, sir, without getting a reward, so I ventured to bring him around. He's in the den. Now, now, now, Swayne, pull yourself together. Here, bring him in. Looks like we're getting warm. Hot, I should say. Come in, young man. How do you do? Sit down, won't you? No, no, no, no. Let me out of here. I'm no squealer. I wouldn't have come here if I'd have known! I-I'm sorry, mister. Honest, I don't know a thing about it. I wouldn't have got mixed up with this. Let me out of here, please. Hey, wait a minute. Wait a minute. There's nothing for you to worry about. Well, come here. Just sit down. Let's see... there was something said about a reward, I believe. Oh, no, no, no. Never mind. I don't want that. Oh, yes, yes. There you are. How's that? Now... This man who left the theater... Who was he? Where did he go? All right. He went out of the theater... and he got into a cab and he went to a gangster's place. We've got him. Who was the gangster? Jim Kinland. But that's me you're talking about. Yes, sir. Nice going, Sherlock. Oh... - Swayne, his hat and coat. - Oh... He's got them on. Let him out. Shut up. Swayne, bring me six bottles of scotch, four bottles of Vichy, two glasses, some cracked ice, and a lot of aspirin. What are you going to do? Get drunk. Watson, you can put away your needle and throw your fingerprint outfit out the window. What's the matter, Sherlock, aren't we going to play detective anymore? No. When I've got to pay a reward to a correspondence-school detective to find out that the most promising suspect in a murder case I'm investigating is myself, I'd better quit. I don't want to hear any more about Mary Smith, Tommy Tennant, murders, or anything else. I guess I wasn't cut out to be a detective in the first place. You weren't cut out to be a very good liar either, Dal. What do you mean? That isn't the reason why you're quitting. Well, you're right, Donna. The reason I'm quitting is because the further I go, the more obvious it becomes to me that the only man who could have killed Tommy Tennant is Tim Winthrop. I can't find a sign that points to anybody else... Motives, suspicious behavior, opportunity. Tim's the only man. Tim's my friend. And if I'm not careful, I'm gonna trip myself. And spill the beans right into Mr. Doremus' lap. I don't know, but it doesn't seem to me. That Tim is the type of chap that would... Well, I'll get him out of town for a while. Meanwhile, we can catch up with our night life. Here's how. Well, if this is a start, It's going to be a short life, if a merry one. Say, am I drunk already, Or is that picture really cockeyed? No, you're still sober. Well. - Well, what do you know about that? - What is it? That, my fair young friend, is a dictograph. Congratulations, Doremus, but I'm signing off. Well, that should win some sort of medal for dumbness. I'm quick to protect him, then turned around and shouted in Doremus' ear. That I'm convinced he's guilty. Who are you calling? Jim Kinland. I'll bet you'd do better with the phone connected. Oh. He doesn't know it, but Mr. Kinland is about to become the victim of a blackmail plot. Hello, Kinland? It's Clay Dalzell. I want you to do me a favor. No, nothing serious. There's a boy named Winthrop, Tim Winthrop, living at the Maltby. Yes, I want you to pick him up and hide him somewhere, Will you? And it's going to be a race. You've got to find him before the police do. Well, that's too bad, Jim. I was hoping you'd be able to find him. Well, I couldn't. My boys have been scouring the town for six hours. Why, of course you couldn't. It's as plain as the nose on your face. I said it was going to be a race, and Doremus has won. Tim's in jail. That's fine. I suppose all you want me to do now. Is go down and get him out of there. Well, let me tell you right now, check or no check, the deal's cold. - Police headquarters. - Hey, wait a minute. Inspector Doremus. Now, you keep me out of this, Dalzell. Hello, Doremus? Dalzell. Congratulations. I understand you solved the Tennant killing. Well, uh, I haven't arrested anybody yet. Oh, that's funny. I understood... Hey, inspector, can I ask you a straight question? Go ahead. I've got nothing to hide. Did you put a dictograph in my apartment? No. But it ain't a bad idea. Thanks. I wonder if Doremus is lying. Doremus don't do much fooling around. This the guy? What happened to him? Thought I told you no rough stuff. We didn't do it. That's the way we found him. Take him in the bedroom, boys, will you? Swayne, get the bed ready and call the doctor. Somebody sure gave him a nice going over. He's in considerable pain. I've given him an opiate. That will make him feel pretty groggy. Is it, uh, all right to talk with him? Perfectly. You'll find him quite rational for periods, But don't tire him too much. Good night. Good night, doctor. Thank you very much. Tim. Tim. Tim. Tim, it's Dal. Do you understand? Dal? What happened? Dal, find her. Find her. They'll kill her! You've got to find her! Find Alice! They've beat me to find out... Who? Tim, who? I don't know. Tim, listen to me. Tim... What did Alice Markham have to do with Marone? Marone? Alice hated him, Dal. He... he ruined her father. He... It... it killed him. Tim, Tim. What was it Marone did? Find her, Dal. Find her. Find her. You know, that's a very funny gag. Well, I don't see anything funny about it. They might have killed the boy. Oh, I wasn't talking about him. I was talking about what he said. Now, look... Marone meets her old man, tells him he's a big-shot banker, gets the old man's dough to invest and goes South with it. Well, the shock kills the old man, and the girl comes to Chicago to see Marone. He has her come to his apartment. Well, knowing the kind of a guy Marone is, It don't take no blueprint to tell me what happened there. At the same time, over on the South side, Fred Dexter's busy getting himself bumped off. Now, the cops know Dexter and Marone are on the outs, so they pinch Marone. Now, this Markham dame... She don't like Marone. First, for what he did, or tried to do, to her up in his apartment. Second, because she blames her old man's death on him. Now... she's his only alibi. So, she disappears to get even, and Marone, who's committed murder all his life and gotten away with it, is gonna burn for a murder he never committed. Now, don't tell me that's not very funny. How do you know all this? You heard what the kid said same as I did. All adds up, that's all. Hmm. Well, thanks, Kinland. You know, this is the first time. This case has made any sense to me at all. Oh, that's nothing. Oh, I don't suppose. You want to let me have that check right now? I don't suppose. No, I didn't think so. Good night. Dal, did you find him? Oh, hello, Mr. Kinland. I haven't had a chance to thank you for those letters. That's all right. Night. Uh, good night, Kinland. What happened, Dal? Did you find him? - Yes, we found him, all right. - Oh, am I glad. I got so excited, I just couldn't stay home. Madam, you don't know nothing. Things have been happening around here so fast, I can't keep track of them. Young man, have you had your dinner yet? Well, no, now that you mention it. Well, you can talk just as well while you're eating and vice versa. Come on. You know, the funniest part of it all is... Thanks. Jim Kinland knows all about what happened to Alice Markham in Chicago. Hello? Yes. No, Mr. Dalzell is not at home. Who was it? Mrs. Classon, sir. Swayne, you mind my asking you. Just why you take it upon yourself. To tell Mrs. Classon that I'm not here? I'm very sorry, sir. Miss Mantin's orders. Oh. So, you're busy running my life again, huh? I'm sorry, Dal. I forgot to mention it, but I decided Mrs. Classon. Is nobody for you to play around with. Oh. Mantin, you're a swell gal, But the next time you stick your nose into my business... Now, don't take that attitude. A girl has to be careful. About the reputation of the man she's going to marry. And yours certainly can't stand being mixed up with that woman. Let me amaze you with a list of the lady's boyfriends. Since her marriage to Mr. Classon. First, there was a gentleman named Howard Smith, Who was rapidly succeeded by a Mr. Steve Stanislaw, a truck driver by profession. And next came a gentleman... Since deceased, as you already know... one Fred Dexter. And then there was a brief in the married world. With a Mr. John Marone and then a lovely little... Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Did you say Dexter and Marone? Numbers 3 and 4. How did you get this? For the neat little sum of $14.60. For a long-distance call to Chicago, On your telephone, by the way. First Dexter and then Marone? No, third Dexter and fourth Marone. And it was common gossip? Known to the man on the street. Mantin, that's as silly a thing as you've ever said. That's covering a lot of ground. If Mrs. Classon was carrying on with Marone and it was common gossip, then Classon must have heard it. And if he knew that, he certainly wouldn't be defending Marone, would he? And if you don't know the answer to that one, I'll tell you. It's "no." Wait here. What is it? Is he dead? Here, give me a hand. Tim? Tim? What was it? What happened? At the window. At the window, someone with a gun. I found yours and fired. Did you recognize him? Who was it? It was a woman. "Although a week has elapsed since the murder, "Inspector Doremus, in charge of the investigation, "refused to make any statement other than the customary one, "that the Police are investigating the case." Clay "Sherlock Holmes" Dalzell. Is just about as Gabby as the inspector. His assistant, Dr. Donna "Watson" Mantin, Is completely in the dark as to his plan. Swayne! Yes, sir? Are you sure no packages have come for me? No, sir. Nothing, sir. All right. Do you want a drink, Dal? No. I wonder why that stuff doesn't come. What is it, Dal? What are you waiting for? Mary Smith. In a package? Just about. I'll get it! Ah, boy. I thought you were never gonna get here. Well, it took longer than we expected, but I hope it'll be satisfactory. Thanks. Your hopes are as nothing compared to mine. Good night. - Mantin, come on! - Come on where? You and I are going to rent an apartment. Swell! Now we're really getting somewhere!

There are a lot of things you don't know. For instance? Inspector Doremus. You're going to get your fingers burned. Oh, inspector. Dalzell. Get this... I'm at 188 Macdougal Street, apartment F. That's right. Will you, uh, hurry over here, please, alone? The murderer of Tommy Tennant. Is going to be here in a very few minutes. No. Yes. Who? I don't know. Well, then, how do you know he's going to be here? There's a list of the suspects. Mr. Winthrop, please. "Tim Winthrop, Horatio Swayne, "Mrs. Classon, Abe Ohlman, "Roger Classon, Jim Kinland, Donna Min..." Clay Dalzell! Shh. Hello, Tim? Dal. Now, keep your shirt on, But if you want to see your Alice, Hurry right over to my apartment. I'll have her there in 30 minutes. Oh, no, she's now at 188 macdougal street, Apartment "f,".

Good girl, and you're right... Unless Tim is the murderer. Oh. I hadn't thought of that. Well, now what are we going to do? Sit down. Shuffle those. And, uh, what are the cards for? Casino. $5 a game. Now, Dal, that just doesn't make sense at all. First you tell Doremus that Tennant's murderer will be here, And then you tell those other people that Mary Smith is here, And now you want to play casino. That's right. Well, you're just plain loony, Unless you're the murderer and I'm the girl. Or vice versa. Look, Tommy Tennant was killed. Just as he was going to tell me something about Mary Smith, Right? Right. The murderer didn't want that something told. Now, who else would know that something? Mary Smith. Exactly. So the murderer will never let her get to my apartment. The innocent ones will go there.

You what? Who is it? Search me. Cleary phoned he'd nailed him in Yonkers, he's on his way to headquarters with him right now. I'm afraid Cleary must be mistaken, inspector. He can't have the right man. I talked to the murderer on that phone not ten minutes ago, I know that. I understand, Mr. Dalzell. It's kind of disappointing to have a hunch go sour on you, but policing and amateur sleuthing is two different things. - Better luck next time. - You're not going? Sure. Got to be at the office when Cleary gets there. Now, wait a minute, inspector. I don't know who Cleary has picked up, but I do know that he's wrong. The real murderer is on his way here now, he'll be here any minute. I'm telling you, you'd better stay. Now, Mr. Dalzell, you ain't gonna tell me my business, are you? Good night, folks. Oh, no, you don't. I'm not leaving. Oh, yes, you are. Donna, I shouldn't have brought you here in the first place, but I never thought you would be in any danger, I was counting on Doremus to stay. - Now, out you go. - Nothing doing! Please, don't argue. There isn't time. Whoever's coming here has already committed one murder and won't stop at another. Now, I'm not going to have... What is it? Raise your hands, Mr. Dalzell, and don't move. Who are you? I've come for Mary Smith. She's in there. So I hear. Tell her to come out. What do you want of her? Tell her to come out. Don't move. Call her from where you are. That's a very interesting trick, Mr. Dalzell... Very interesting. Now, where is Alice Markham? What do you want with her? Silence. The same kind of silence that you got from Tommy Tennant? Exactly. And the same kind I'm going to get from you. And for the same reason. You know too much. I don't know anything except... Except that you'd better go back where you came from. And keep out of trouble. I didn't come here for advice. I came here for information. Now I'll give you just 15 seconds to start talking. All right. I'll talk. Well? Well, we got her, Mr. Dalzell. Oh, it's you. Oh, where is... Donna? Donna? Is she dead? - You all right? - Yes, I'm all right. Is she dead? No, I just slugged her. Well, you didn't treat me any too gently, either. Doremus, I owe you an apology. I went for that act of yours... Entrance, exit, and story. Well, I thought someone might be listening or watching. We'd have a better chance if they thought I wasn't around. Who is she? Say, could she be Mary Smith? She could be, but she isn't. I don't know who it is. Well, why don't you take her mask off and see? Mask? What mask? Mr. Classon! Well, what do you know? Where do you suppose he got that idea? Probably from Mary Smith. Well, wherever he got it, I heard him say he killed Tennant, and that's good enough for me. Come on, boys. Take him down to headquarters. Well, that's a hot one. What? I had the answer all the time and didn't know it. Inspector... Classon not only killed Tommy Tennant, he also bumped off Fred Dexter in Chicago. Donna, you were right about Mrs. Classon's affairs with Dexter and Marone. That's why Classon killed Dexter and then fixed the blame on Marone. And that's what Tommy Tennant meant by "the greatest double cross ever pulled." For although Classon was Marone's lawyer, he was trying to do away with Marone's alibi, Alice Markham, and that's why she disappeared from the Prince Theater. It wasn't Tim's shout that frightened her. It was seeing Classon sitting in the second row. She blamed Marone for her father's death. Her mask, her disappearances, were all because she hated Marone and wouldn't testify. And if Mr. Classon had only known that, well, he could have saved himself considerable headache. Dal, you took the words right out of my mouth. Dal. Where's Alice? What's happened to her? Oh, Tim, I'm so sorry. W-where is she, Dal? Where is she? I've been waiting and waiting. I know. Tim, I didn't mean to worry you. Now, I think you'd better run along with the inspector. Oh, this is the fella? Come along, son. But what for? W-where is she, Dal? She's at the Inspector's house. Dal, you didn't find her? Sure. Well, it may not have been a big wedding, but it certainly was a noisy one. And I think they ought to be very happy. I like Tim, and I think Alice is a very nice girl. - Very. - I'm glad we found her. By the way, how did we find her? Well, don't you remember? The villain had tied her to the subway tracks. Just then, the Bronx express came thundering through... Now, Dal, stop clowning, I asked you a serious question. And you'll get a serious answer. Now, look... If you earned $1,500 a week, what would you do with it? Spend it. That's right, you would. But she didn't. She put it in the bank. Well? Shh. To open a bank account, you have to give a name. Well? When you give a name, even though it isn't your own, you have to give an address. Well? Well?! Was it as simple as that? It was as simple as that. Dal, you're wonderful. Donna, that's common gossip. To the newlyweds. To the newlyweds. Bottoms up. Well, I don't know what you're going to do, but I'm going to bed. Oh, Dal, I've forgotten something. Yes? What? Hello? Daddy? I-I won't be home tonight. No. I'm staying at Dal's. Yes? Yes, daddy. Yes. Yes, of course it's all right. We were married this afternoon.
