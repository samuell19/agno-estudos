Oh! What's up my people? Welcome to Jamaica, man. This is your old bosom bloody, The Cryptkeeper. - Nice hair. Ain't they cool? Only they call these deadlocks! Ha ha! Oh! One of the things I love about Jamaica is the eye-popping honeys... Of course I'd prefer them with a little less meat on their bones. Or better yet... just bones! Ha ha! Thanks! But that's not what I've been meaning when I say... I want a little head. Ha ha! Anyway man. I just wrapped my new movie here in Jamaica. Where they dance, smoke grass, and all the nice girls be in the voodoo trance. What a place to work. You've got mangos, papayas, tourists... and they're all so delicious! Ha ha!

Ooh, wicked girls. Not for long. All I want is jerk chicken, jerk fish, jerk pork... More jerk chicken, sir? She's a work of art, isn't she, superintendent? Which I will own someday. I don't believe she's for sale. Everyone is for sale, doctor. Really? How's your jerk? Attention, everybody. Please... Settle everybody. Settle. Thank you. Now, we've all gathered here today for a very special occasion... my baby brother Wesley's birthday. And I know you were all looking forward to partying with the island wild man... as I was... but, unfortunately, Dr. Winsvold has informed me that Wesley is feeling a bit under the weather. Aw! Aw!

I know you said no to the raptomycin, but we've got nothing to lose, and it's been working really well in the clinical trials. For God's sake, that's enough. The review board takes a long time to determine compassionate use, and you don't want me to repeat my speech on the use of non-fda-approved drugs and disastrous career consequences. This child is not gonna make it. Do not turn me into the heartless, crusty, head of a department who's going to be making big speeches about liability and insurance companies and all that crap. You know better. Hey, Phil. To what do I owe the pleasure? Can I have an amp of raptomycin? Dr. Javitz and the review board gave you the thumbs-up for compassionate use? Uh-huh. Really? Do you have it in writing? Look, Phil, I'm in a huge hurry. I don't have time for this. I told you I got the approval, all right? You know what they say... No good deed goes unpunished.

Yeah, I-I'm calling to... to ask you for a favor if... if you think that's appropriate. I'm... I realize that I can't practice medicine for the next two years, but... Well, there... there is a medical referral service, and they're offering an overseas position which doesn't require a license. Yeah, the patient was diagnosed with atypical lymphocytosis, slipped into a coma twice last year. Lives in Jamaica... some out-of-the-way place. They want someone to give supportive care. Oh, well, I'm... I'm calling you because... Because I... well, they do ask for a reference, and although I do have other references, I... I think that they should know why I had my license suspended before they decide whether or not they want to hire me. Welcome. Welcome to Jamaica. Welcome. Welcome to Jamaica. Hope you enjoy your stay. ♪ Way back in the day... ♪ ♪ the vibes and the drum and the bass ♪ hey... How you doin'? I am fine, baby girl. And you are very fine, too, you know. But me at work now. Normally, I would love to make your acquaintance and show you a good time, but me have to work. I'm... I'm Dr. Dodgson. I'm J.B. I'm sorry. Can I help you? No, I'm fine. Yes. Actually, very fine. Yes, yes. So, you are from New York? Uh-huh. Yeah, man. Me, I want to go to New York and live there, you know. Really? I thought Jamaica was like a paradise. For tourists. For Jamaicans, life is very hard, you know. Why does everyone carry machetes? For work. And protection. Are the mountains dangerous? Hmm. Some parts, yes. Like I said, life can be very hard here. The people are very, very poor. The Claybourne estate is up there in the mountains... sugarcane fields, mango, ugli fruit as far as the eye can see. What's going on up there? Oh, they are burning the sugarcane to bring in the harvest. Uh-huh. It's a seasonal thing, you know. Hey, that's my father up there. Do you mind if I say hello? No. Go ahead. Help... Me. Oh... I'm sorry. You all right? I'm... I'm... I'm great. It's really hot. I shouldn't have stopped so close to the fire. Oh, no, no. No problem. You know, my father's like you, you know. He's a doctor. Oh. Really? Um, what school did he go to? No school. He's originally from Haiti. He's what you call a houngan... a kind of voodoo priest, a healer. Yeah, I want the full amount wired to Luxembourg. Yeah, I know I agreed to pay you and the others from the escrow account. I just think this is much cleaner and safer. Yeah... I'll call you right back. I have somebody I want you to meet. Dr. Alice Dodgson. Pleased to meet you. Paul Claybourne. Well, welcome to wonderland, Alice. Come in. Thank you. J.B., could you get Violette to get us something cold to drink, please? Yeah, man. Let's step out onto the terrace. Violette... It's, uh... Mr. Paul would like you to bring him much cooler out there. And the doctor something cool to drink. So, Dr. Javitz told me that you're a wonderful doctor, says that you're quite a fighter. You never give up on a patient. He also told you I had my license suspended. Well, any doctor who would take a job so I'm gonna need a release from you stating... In this godforsaken place has to have some problems. Dr. Javitz also told me what happened. And I have to say I really admire you. I just hope you can help my brother. You see, he's the, uh, only family that I have left. I love him very much. Thank you. Violette, this is Dr. Dodgson. Hello. She'll be staying with us for a while. Thank you, dear. Violette and Ramon here... they've been with us forever. They're... they're really like family. They practically raised Wesley and I. So if there's anything you need, just, uh, just ask. Mr. Claybourne... If your brother has encephalitis, there's not much I can do for him except monitor his condition and put him on a healthy regimen. That's not gonna be easy. You see, encephalitis is just part of the problem. What's the other part? He has, um, he has brain seizures and... oh, well, that's not uncommon for someone with encephalitis. You don't understand. What makes the medical problem difficult is... This is gonna sound strange. My brother, uh... He thinks that, uh, he's a zombie. Well, not really a zombie. He thinks someone is messing with his mind. Hi. Oh. Hi. I'm sorry. Dr. Dodgson... I'm caro. Uh-huh. Paul thought maybe I could help you. I used to help Dr. Winsvold. Minor stuff. Actually... Maybe you could help me with something here. I'm just going through Wesley's medical records, just trying to get up to speed here and... And I get data up to three months ago. After that date, nothing... which makes no sense. That's strange. When did Dr. Winsvold leave? Two months ago, right? So there's a one-month gap in the data. Uh, he didn't leave. He died. He what? Didn't Paul... Oh, maybe I shouldn't... No. No, maybe I misunderstood him. What did he die of? I think it was a heart attack. Mr. Hope... friend of Paul... used to be a doctor. He came and examined the body. I think he said it was a heart attack. You're very pretty. Hmm? Would you model for me? I'm sorry... what? Do you want to model for me? I sculpt. Oh. If you have some time. So, when are you going to go see Wesley? Tomorrow morning. I can go with you, if you'd like. He's a little funny at first, but I get along with him. He's great. Wesley was a great musician. And he is so funny. You sound like you're in love with him. Everybody is in love with him. Come, master. Get in the car. Aah! You see what I'm talking about? Where is he going? I don't know. I ask him, but he won't tell me. Can I get you something? Perhaps a nightcap? Oh, no, thanks. I'm just gonna get a good night's sleep, focus on the challenge. Well, that it is. But I feel you're up for it. Night, Alice. Good night. Sleep tight. Okay. If you change your mind about that nightcap... Aah! Dr. Dodgson... Doctor, are you okay? Ahhhhhh! Aah! Aah! Oh! Aah! Aah! Comin'. Comin'! Hi. Good morning. Hi, um, uh... I'm sorry if I woke... did I wake you up? No, I'll be ready in a minute. You know, um, I... I can go by myself. And, you know, it's quite nice. I can just, you know, kind of wander around. W-whatever. Um... Come on, girl. I'll put on some coffee. Um... Wow, you're really... really good. Yeah? Yeah. I don't sell much. Well, uh, you know, if I had money, I'd... I'd buy one. You're a doctor, and you're not rich? That's right. Girl, we both got to get serious about gettin' rich... While we're still young and beautiful. So, listen... Last night I... I found something in my shower. A mongoose? Oh, they're all over the place. No, not a mongoose. Uh... It was a doll with rusty nails stuck in it. Somebody put obeah on you. But don't worry, it only work if you believe it does. What's obeah? Obeah. It's voodoo. Jamaican version. If you don't take it too seriously, it's like disco. Voodoo is like disco? Yeah, you know, you dance hard, you drink a lot of rum, smoke some ganja. Your head goes to a different place. You feel sexy and fun... Really, really loose. So, the airlines lost your luggage. My luggage? No. Oh, because of what I'm wearing? Oh, no, this isn't what I was wearing yesterday. I mean, it looks like what I was wearing 'cause I have multiples just, you know, to keep things simple. It's just a fresh pair. Really? It's like a uniform. So, you're gonna let me lend you a dress for dinner tonight? A dress? Doctor... Wesley lives there. Maybe I should go first, just to get him ready. Is that okay? Yeah. All right. Wesley? Doctor... Rough night. Wesley, come on. Wesley. Hi. Dr. Alice Dodgson. You know, I'm gonna be honest with you. I don't need a doctor. Oh, I'm sorry. Does my breath smell awful? I've smelled worse. So, how are you doing this morning? Wow... So young and already so deep into the medical bull... If I felt great, why would my brother drag you all the way out here? Just so... Uh... Sit down. Sit down. You know, I hate to sound like those doctors that you're so fond of, but drinking and lymphocytosis... pretty bad mix. What makes you think that I have lymphocytosis? Your medical records. Actually, my medical records say "atypical lymphocytosis." Atypical, as in, "we don't know what the... We're talking about." So, if you don't mind, I'm gonna take your blood pressure, listen to your heart and lungs. Open your shirt. Wow, looks like I got myself my own Polidori. What's a Polidori? Byron's Polidori? Give me a big breath. I-I'm impressed. I've never met a doctor who reads poetry. Who's Byron? What's a Polidori? Big breath. Byron the poet had a personal physician named Polidori. Did you know that Polidori had a big crush on Byron? Byron was a batty boy. A really big crush. All right, um, roll up your shirt sleeve, please. I'm gonna take your blood pressure, take some blood. No, no, no, no, no, no. No blood. Sorry, I'm sick of you doctors sucking my blood. You see, what I have, there is nothing that you can do anything about. What is it that you think you have? You wouldn't understand. If I'm gonna be able to help you at all... This is over. It's over, I said! I'm sorry. It's just nothing has worked. Does he really think he's a zombie? I mean, that's bizarre. He seems like a smart guy. Oh, and where does he go at night? What, you don't want to tell me? No, it's not that. I know it's obeah-related. How can I help him if... I just don't know exactly what he does. Okay, um, do you know where I can find J.B.? As a voodoo priest, could your father turn someone into a zombie? My father... I don't know if he'll talk to you about such things. I'm asking just so I can understand, you know, what Wesley considers to be his problem. How is it defined? What are the symptoms of that state? It's a sickness of the soul. If someone's soul is sick, do you know which medicines to give him? No, I don't do souls. What you look for? My sunglasses. I thought maybe I left them here yesterday. Y-you're not going to tell, no? Can you drive? Yeah, man. I am fine. Actually... Very fine. W-w-w-wait. Back up. Wha... there's a man in that tree. It's a ceremony. Like communing with nature. It's like getting your head to stop thinking so much so you can see more clear. Lord, it's hot, eh? J.B., what's wrong? J.B.! J.B.! What are you... J.B.! What wrong with you?! Oh, my God! What the hell's wrong with you? Oh, you gotta stop smoking that stuff. Move over. I'm driving. J.B., these people need a doctor. So, if your father would like, I could, uh... I could come up here two or three times a week. What you talk about? He is a doctor. Why you think all these people come here to see him? I didn't mean... he's healed many people, you know? Just wait over here by the worship house. Where? Here. What's wrong with this guy? His relatives think an obeah priest blow dust, poison, 'pon him, make him a zombie. Why the shackles? So he don't go to work for the obeah priest. Soon come. O... Okay. Hi. Respect. Oh. Thank you for taking the time... Two minutes. I've got people waiting. I understand. I wanted to ask your advice. I have a patient who... who thinks someone's made him a zombie. Wesley? Yes. There is nothing I can do to help him. The obeah man doing it to him is bigger than me. Bigger than you? Can you please put me in touch with this bigger man? No. Is he trying to harm Wesley? Look... oh, my God! Oh, my God! Aah! No! No! No, no, no! No, no! What's wrong? His heart is racing. Is he epileptic? D-does he need medicine? Medicines won't do no good. Papa, okay. Okay. Okay. Look at ya! Oh, my God! Is it okay? I made a big mistake lending you that dress! Now everybody will be looking at you and not at me. Look at you! Come on, tell the truth. What? You exercise. Well, I run, yeah. Really? Yeah. You can come with me sometime. Oh, God. No, girl. I don't have any sneakers. Come on, I'll introduce you. That's Jackson. Hi. That's a big guy. Not so big. This is Matthew hope, the smartest, nicest, and craziest man in all of Jamaica. This is Wesley's new doctor, Alice Dodgson. Nice to meet you. Nobody looked like you when I went to medical school... Back in the middle ages. Oh, so you're a doctor? Was. I mostly do veterinary work now and odd bits of research. Oh, what do you research? He's a big poom-poom researcher. Oh, what's poom-poom? Such bad class. Thank you. What's poom-poom? Come on. What? Why's everyone laughing? What's poom-poom? Ah, poom-poom. Now, this is a question that deserves an answer. I don't... No, no, no... hold on a second. I'm very interested... What is poom-poom? Oh, you're kidding. No! You're kidding! Oh! I didn't get much opportunity for shop talk. Spider to obeah is as the snake is to voodoo. Why spider? It's the wisest of all creatures. No direct conflict with the prey... just lays traps, waits, and then boom! I'm surprised you'd be interested in it. Oh, my interest is purely professional. I have a patient who's interested in it. Poor Wesley. Is he expected? Well, Paul was hoping, but... It's tough on both these boys. First the mother tragedy, then Wesley so sick. You know, I have this fabulous property in negril. Thank you. What happened to the mother? Murdered, 20 years ago. Horrible thing. Caro's mother, also... same way, a month earlier. How? Little chop-chop. Machete action. Wesley! Wes! Wesley, you look so much better. Thank you. Come on. Your seat's all ready for you. Oh, that's great. Uh, but, uh, maybe I should sit next to the doctor... just, uh... just in case I need some sudden medical attention. As you wish. Ah. Oh, Wesley! It's so wonderful to see you back at the dinner table again. I missed your cooking. Sit down, sit down. So sick of that crap those doctors made me eat. The smell makes me feel better already. So, Polidori, how do you like Jamaica? I like Jamaica very much, your lordship. Every day I learn something new. What did you learn today, Polidori? Today I learned what poom-poom is. A napkin, your lordship? Goodness! Woman ?2: Oh, yay! Whatever you're doing for him, it's working. I haven't seen him like this in over a year. Oh, it's not me. I haven't done anything yet... But I will. Come on, Wesley! Does anybody want to dance with me? Whoo! Whoo! Yeah, baby! Come on, baby! Here we go, now! Come on, now! Once the estate sells, the brown bitch will be hocking her wares on the street, where she belongs. I love it! Don't you find her repulsive? Actually, no. I think she's a great girl. Did you just say Paul is selling the estate? Get your hands off my girl! Cut it out! What? Come here! Easy, man! Let him go! Hey, stop that! Don't you have any shame?! Thank you for coming. Good to see you. - Fabulous. - I mean, I just... good night, Paul. Good night. No, no, I am not... - Stop it! I want you to go right to bed. Stop it! Yours or mine? - Shut up! - Loosen up for once! I'm serious. I want you to go straight to bed. Your doctor is dead set on getting you better. You know, there are all kinds of ways of getting better. I think doctors need to be open to all kinds of treatments. So should patients. Go to sleep. Good night. I can't believe you were prancing around with that little native slut. Do you know how revolting you looked? I don't know why Paul even allows her to live on the estate. Or maybe he's doing her, too. You know, I wouldn't be surprised. I heard the guy fathered a child with one of his own servant girls. It was just disgusting. Don't you dare raise the volume on me! You're being so rude! Aaaaah! What the hell was that? I'll check. Beautiful. It's a flat tire. Pop the trunk. Is this gonna take long? It's a little creepy out here. Scott? Scott? Scott? I want to go home. Wesley! Open up! Alice. Alice. Wesley, are you in there? Wesley? Let me help you. Aah! Wait. J.B. I only wanted to talk to you without them knowing. Them? Who is "them," J.B.? The bigger man? If I tell you, I dead. Please, for your own sake, just leave the place tonight. Just run. They are more powerful than anything, anyone. They make you sick physically. When I catch fever, when your resistance is gone, t-t-they get inside your mind, your brain. You get these visions. They're scary, very real. Now they give me the same dumb mirage sickness. J.B., I am not big on running away from anything. I will go at this until I figure it out, okay... J.B.? J.B.? Caro, are you asleep? Comin'! Comin'! Ay! Oh. Hi. Hi. I just wanted to thank you for lending me the dress and the shoes. What are those for? Well, they're... I thought maybe you'd want to go running, but, uh, I see you're busy. Busy? Men... no stamina. We grew up together... Paul, Wesley, J.B., and me. Oh. Violette used to take us up to Julian's, J.B.'S father, on Sundays. I heard about your mother. My mother? And Wesley and Paul's. That must have been very difficult for all of you. Yeah. My poor mother. She was Haitian, you know. She came here with all the others in 1962. What others? Oh, Julian, Ramon, Violette, Mr. Claybourne's little Haitian mafia. Very clever. Wait, Alice. That was the same year Jamaica got its independence. All the British landowners freaked out... thought there would be riots, that the land would be taken over. So Mr. Claybourne came and bought the estate for almost nothing. Thought he could scare the locals with voodoo crossed with obeah. Ramon mess up their bodies, and Julian mess up their souls. Worked great for him. Maybe we should get going. Who's this guy? I thought I knew everybody who owned a bike. Oh! What's wrong with you, man?! Are you crazy?! Oh, my. Oh! C-come on. Let's run. Oh, my God. So, about the two killings... did they ever find out who did it? Nobody knows who did it. Or maybe they do, and they hushed it up. Rich men can get away with, well, you know. So you think Mr. Claybourne? Me don't know. He was a strange... Alice! Ow! Are you okay? Oh, my God! What? Aaah! Have you checked on Wesley this morning? No, not... not yet. What does... what does that have to do with anything? Isn't it customary for a doctor to check on their patient first thing in the morning? Customary? No. No, Wesley likes to sleep late. He needs his sleep. Why would I wake him? If him wake up late, that mean him go to sleep late... Very late. - Let me go, man! Let me go, man! - Look who's here with all kinds of interesting scratches on. Me not do nothin'! That's exactly what you said two months ago when that other young lady was found dead here. What other young lady was found dead? Superintendent... Those scratches... That's me. It must have been a very special night. I can practically hear the moaning. What other young lady was found dead here? Al... look, please don't leave. I can explain everything. Explain? You never tell me that the doctor before me supposedly dies of a heart attack. You never tell me that a woman is found slashed to ribbons on the premises that very same night. Alice... You never tell me that the police consider my patient to be a possible homicidal maniac. You never tell me... look, Alice... I apologize, okay? My brother is not a killer. Oh, really? So you can swear that he was with you last night, because I can tell you one thing for sure is he was not in his room. What the hell? Oh, yeah. Wait. Wait. Isn't this nice? Do you like that? Do you like that? Mr. Claybourne, I am done here. You're gonna have to find yourself another doctor. Dr. Dodgson, please. You see, you don't understand. Wesley and I, we spent our entire childhood in a boarding school in New York. He's the only family that I have. I'm just afraid of losing him. I should never have come back here. This is not a good place. Like hell it's not. This is a beautiful place. What our father did to it is a tragedy. Wesley, are you all right? You think that I killed those people? Well, where were you last night after dinner? I don't know. What do you mean, you don't know? I have... These... I don't know... blackouts. It's like a fever. It... it takes me over. It's like I'm some kind of zombie. When we were kids, we used to go to these ceremonies up in the hills. Do you remember? It was really exciting. I was all under control. A couple of years ago... I started to go back. Well... I wasn't in control anymore. Then why don't you stop going? Oh, because I can't. Look, doctor, we can replace anything that you need. I can have it flown in from Miami within 48 hours, okay? I can get you 24-hour security here on the estate. We can get you anything you need, just please, you know, don't give up on us. I'm gonna need a sample of his blood. Thanks. Alice! So they talked you into stayin'! I knew it! I see the way you look at Wesley and your poom-poom just take over! Whoa, slow down, please! The blood samples! It's him again! Who again? That guy on the bike, the one from this morning. You know, he could have killed that real-estate woman. There is no one there. I'm not taking any chances. Hold on! Caro... Caro, turn around! Aah! Aah! Caro, look up there! Aah! Aah! Are you hurt? That guy... What guy?! There was no guy! What do you mean, there was no guy? Don't start messin' with my mind, Alice. I know what I saw! Ow! You're hallucinating. I'm sorry, but I think that you have... the same thing that Wesley and J.B. Have. I don't have anything! I don't have anything, and if I did, I wouldn't want to know about it! Wesley's... Is incurable, and if I had it... which I don't... It would ruin my day. I'll be more than happy to have these analyzed for you, Dr. Dodgson, but the day shift is almost finished. It will have to be done during the night shift. I'll have the results for you tomorrow. This won't hurt. Caro has a medical problem, and I want to make sure you didn't contract it. Almost got it. Okay? Dispatch... come in, dispatch... So, how are you feeling? Like swimmin'. We should... come on. Let's go get Matthew and Wesley. You know, I really think that you should... what, buy a swimming suit? I got one right here. You know, you're really gonna have to stop being so cool 'cause I'm gonna wind up wanting to be exactly like you. Oh, God forbid! One of me is more than enough. Matthew! We thought we heard voices. So... Where we all going? Whoo-hoo! Aah! I just... I just don't get it. What is making these people sick, and why isn't it more of an epidemic? Why is it only people associated with the Claybourne estate? I, um, you know, I'm not sure. - Alice, come on in, girl! Come on! For the 10th time, I don't have a suit. That's no excuse! There's no one around except Wesley... he'll see you naked sooner or later... and Matthew, who just might pay $100 to see you take off them clothes! Absolutely. $200, if you'll take a check. Yeah! Whoo! Yeah! Make it a certified check. All right! Come on! Come on! ♪ Give your lovin' in the mornin', girl ♪ ♪ give your lovin' in the evenin', now ♪ ♪ give your lovin' at nighttime, too ♪ Wesley! Is he in just such complete denial about his condition? This is very serious. He could be dead in six months. Oh, I could be dead tomorrow. You could be dead tonight. People here don't think about that kind of thing. Drink a little root juice, smoke a little ganja. Hey, baby. Here, have some root juice. Root juice? They make it locally. Two glasses of this, you'll be purring louder than Hercules here. It's good. Mmm. Great. Mr. Jackson, a lady friend of yours gave me a substantial amount of money for me to turn my back at the right moment. I believe she has a car outside waiting for you. Hit me right here, sir. No, I just had that filling put in yesterday. This one. Come, come. Come on. I don't think so! Wow! What? What are you looking at? You want to go for a walk? Hey, you come to give me a ride? Mr. Jackson... Out for a little walk? This is great. I can't wait to call home and say, "guess what. I just... I just, uh, kissed a zombie." You know what else? I've seen people turn into zombies up in the hills. They have the dust blown into their face, the whole thing. That's not what's wrong with me. I have something different. I have someone messing with my mind. Wesley. Wesley... Please... Rats. Aah! Yah! Aaaah! Aaaah! Hi. Yah! Alice! Alice! Matthew? Get my bag out of my desk! Oh, my God! This can't be happening! She's coming out of it. She's having some kind of a seizure. Breathe in. Out. In. Did anybody else... Hear the drums? Drums? Then I just had the most horrifyingly real dream of my life. I really got to learn to relax. I got to chill out. Hold her head! Hold her head! What's wrong? We've got to get her to a doctor. Try and support her. Go. Watch your step. I got the test results. It's a virus like htlv-1, but different. It's a retrovirus... rna converting into DNA, but it's been altered. I've never seen anything like it. Stick me and run a test. For what? The same virus. "How's it hanging?" That's one trip too many to Miami. L-listen, this is gonna sound a little weird, um, but it's on my mind. Um, I was fine, you know, with everything else, but this girl, this doctor, Alice, you know, she's a good person, and she has nothing to do with this... now, remember... you know what I mean? The deal closes in three days. I know. God knows... we don't want anything to get in the way of all that money, do we? Please, if I can just tell her what she has or at least, you know, um, nudge her in the right direction... it's a little late to be getting self-righteous, isn't it? I'm not being self-righteous, but even a bastard like myself, who has a total disregard for morality... Has to draw the line somewhere. Hello. Dr. Shaba. Sure. Just a second. It's for you. For me? Yes? Hello. It's Matthew. Oh. Hi. I hope you're feeling better. I'm waiting for the results. Well, listen... I might have a thought or two about the nature of the, uh, problem... the medical problem you're so concerned about. Really? It's just a hunch, but I think it's worth checking out. We're just taking a little blood sample... To help somebody who needs to understand what's happening to her. Come in. I'm in the back. Alice, I've got something really interesting to show you. You got here a whole lot quicker than I thought you... oh. What... what are you doing here? In two days, me going be rich. Hmm. Me don't want anything going wrong. Now, listen, superintendent. I have a piece of the action, too, and I need the money just as badly as you do. But like I told Paul... T-this young girl can't do us any harm. Why do any more damage than we have... aah! Well? Positive... same as you and Jackson. You heard about Jackson? No. What about Jackson? He was shot and killed. Matthew? Matthew? Alice! Quick! He's dead! What are the police doing here? Paul's worried about safety after the murders. Maybe he's worried about what will happen when everybody finds out they're out of a home and job. What? Why would people lose their home and job? That woman that was killed... the real-estate broker... told me that... that he was selling the estate, that the deal was about to close. Paul! Are you out of your... Mind? What do you mean, the deal's just about to close? Never mind you didn't have the respect or the decency to ask me for my opinion... Wesley... But I think you also forgot that I own 50 % of this place... Could you please just calm down? And I have no intention of selling this place! Wes... Wes, I have nothing but respect if not complete admiration for you, and I always have. You know that. But... but your sickness... oh, my sickness. My sickness has nothing to do with this! Why would we sell this place?! Not to mention our responsibility to the people that have lived and worked here for the past 30-odd years. Wes, we are not responsible for these people's lives! Agriculture is no longer profitable. We can't... oh. I'm... I'm sorry. I didn't mean to disturb you. That's okay, Violette. Could you put the drinks down? I thought you might be thirsty. While you're at it, Violette... Get the... Off my property! What? Wesley! I'm sorry. I was trying to make him understand what he's about to do to people who are like family to us. What... Violette, could you please leave us? Wesley... It's okay. It's okay. Violette, would you please leave?! Don't yell at her! You calm down! It's all right. I'm sorry. No, it's all right. I'm leaving. I am not gonna let you get away with this, Paul. I will not sign off. I don't need you to sign off! I've gotten power of attorney. You're no longer fit to make decisions regarding your own welfare. Wesley, you'd better calm down. You're a sick man. You could very easily end up dead. Are you threatening me? No. I'm just reminding you of your delicate medical condition. You really could end up dead. Violette? Violette, it's Alice Dodgson. Violette? Oh! Oh, Violette, I'm sorry to bother you. I just... I wanted to... See if I could get your help. It's about Wesley. No. Please. It's... it's important. I-I really need your help. I can't. Please. Please don't say no. So, do a lot of people in Jamaica believe in obeah? You know, they say Haiti is 95 % catholic and 100 % voodoo. I suppose the same thing applies to Jamaica where obeah is concerned. It's just that people don't like to talk about it. I'm not sure if Julian is going to agree to help you, because he's also very afraid. Well, tell him that his son is also sick and the only way we can help his son is if we can figure out who is infecting these people. Now, Julian told me that there's a bigger man... an obeah man... that is presumably more powerful than he is. Julian, he does white magic. He heals people. But... This bigger man... He take Wesley's soul. He take poor Wesley's soul. Can you tell me who is it that took Wesley's soul? No, no. I don't know. I don't know. I don't... I don't know anybody who would do something like that to Wesley. He's such a good person. When he got sick... He thought he was going to die, and he wrote his will. And he left all his money to the people who live here... everybody. Do you know anybody so good? Alice? This is for if your man leave you and you want him back, and, uh, this is for... what about powder... dust... that you use to make zombies? Does that really exist? I do not make zombies. But if you wanted to, could you? To make someone into a zombie, you will need... A lot of hate in your heart... anger. I understand it's illegal, and I'm not gonna tell anybody, but technically, do you know how it's done? He could make a zombie if he wanted to, but he wouldn't. But there is a way. The powder... It is like poison... like they use in the Gulf war, like... Biochemical poison. It will not kill. It will only take away the humanity of the man... the soul. It... it take your will. It's like you are there, but you're not there. Is it... is this permanent, like that guy out there? Not necessarily. There is another powder. You give it to somebody who was made into a zombie. But it will only work if you give it in time. You mean like an antidote? Yeah. Toxins and neurology, I get. But the visions... the mind thing... how does that happen? Is this really necessary? Oh, come on. You look beautiful. Anyway, it makes the gods happy when you make yourself pretty for them. Well, the first God that looks down my blouse gets a bloody nose. Help... Me. Help... Me. Help... Me. Help... Me. Help... Me. Alice, you all right? You okay? Yeah. Yeah. I'm okay. I just... Something just... Happened. I don't... I just saw something. Uh, thank you for... thank you for taking me here. Uh, I have to go now. But what are you going to do? What are you lookin' at? You mean like an antidote?

What we have is F.E.L.V., which is feline leukemia which has been altered so that it can infect human beings. Now, what kind of a doctor do you think would be able to come up with something like that? Veterinarian. Exactly. And who do we know? ♪ Constantly create new diseases ♪ Matthew hope. Your charming brother wants to sell the place, knows that you'll block it, so he gets the mysterious "bigger man" to infect you with the virus and, with obeah, basically render you the village idiot. No offense. None taken. Wait. If that's true, why does Paul take the time to get a first doctor and a second doctor? Why does he not just let Wesley die? No offense. None taken, but go on. Because this wonderful village idiot writes a will leaving his half of the property to the workers. Really? The trick is to keep young Wesley alive yet unwell. So why kill Dr. Winsvold and... and Dori? The servant girl... she was killed the same night the doctor had the heart attack. And then the real-estate couple. They had to get rid of Dr. Winsvold probably because he was about to identify the virus, which is why they deleted the last month of the medical records. So they get rid of Matthew hope and Jackson, that real-estate woman gets hacked up... it sure looks to me like somebody's covering their tracks. There's still a piece missing that I will find if it kills me. Bad choice of words. No, the whole $100 million. Uh, yeah. Yeah. I'll... I'll call you right back. Okay. Thank you. Got good news. Hey, you know, I'm a little busy right now. Well, great news for Wesley, anyway. Your brother's gonna be fine. Really? Wow. You don't look happy. Oh, that's great news. Really. I mean, it's... it's a surprise. Well, does he know? He was first to know. Hmm. Oh, well, then, I guess we're gonna have to celebrate, huh? Is he in his room? Oh, you know, he's not. He's downtown at the courthouse getting your power of attorney revoked, seeing as he's in full control of his faculties. Oh! Oh, also... I called a couple friends of mine in New York, and I said, "just check up on me tomorrow... you know, in case I turn up dead." Alice... I think you're as crazy as my brother. Is there a problem, superintendent? No problem. Just need to clear some things up. You care to join us? We'll go back to the station. It'll take a minute. Okay. I just need to go and see the judge. So if you don't mind waiting five minutes... we don't have five minutes. Busy, busy day. You have a warrant? We don't need it. I'll see you in five minutes. Take him! Get your hands off me! Get your hands off me! Violette! - Hmm? I can't find Wesley anywhere, or the doctor. The doctor's in the livestock yard. And Wesley? I haven't seen Wesley all day. Wesley! Wesley! Wesley? I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Those drums... Are not Julian's. I have a very bad feeling. Let's go. Guys, I'm in a hurry! Come on! Get out the way! The road is closed. What do mean, the road is closed? Where are you going? Caro... You can't leave. Caro... It's unsafe. When I need to ask some big, fat slob... For his opinion... I'll call you. I have an idea. There's another way. I haven't tried it since I was a child. It could be blocked. Could be a little scary. Okay. How... how is this a way out? The original plantation owner built an escape tunnel in case the slaves got machete-happy. Oh, great. It's just a bat. Oh. A bat. Perfect. Which way? That way. Come on. Alice... Alice... I can't. Yeah, you can. I can't. I can't. Uh, okay. I'm gonna go on up ahead. No. No, Alice. I don't want you out there by yourself. I'll be okay. I think. Are you sure? Yeah. Please don't scream. I know where I'm taking you. J.B. I am sorry. You've got to stop scaring me like this. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Get down! They might turn him into a zombie. I didn't want to do this, you know. You made me. It's your fault. You... Greedy... No. Hold on to this. Aah! Don't even think about it. Alice, this isn't gonna work! Oh, yeah? You dig him up. You... Bitch! Aah! In a way... This is just like a wedding... you and Wesley united forever in merry zombiehood. Why'd you do this? How would you like growing up in the Claybourne house with the servants? Me... a Claybourne. Claybourne? What are you talking about? Your father, Richard... was my father. He killed my mother so your mother wouldn't find out about me. But she did find out, and you know what he did to her. Funny how history repeat itself. That servant girl you knock up... same thing. Like father... Like son. So you're asking me why. Revenge for my mother. And the money. So, Paul... Tomorrow your dead body will be found up here with three zombies roaming around. And the estate go to the next Claybourne in line, which is me. No one will ever believe you. DNA, brother. Aah! - Oh, God! No! I... Was... I was gonna... Give you so much money. I don't want "so much money." I want all the money. And you. Girl... You, I like. Tried everything to get you to go. Doll hanging in your room. Smashed up the lab. Nothing work. You faked being sick. Mm-hmm. Made me feel bad infecting you with a dirty swab. Not the others. Even Jackson. It was fun trancin' him into killin' Paul's poom-poom And them real-estate assholes How about we both have some fun? You blow this in J.B.'S face. You turn him into a zombie. No. I can make you do it. Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on. Come on! We got to dig him out and go to Julian's to get the antidote powder. Could be a bit too late. Hurry! In the presence of God and before this congregation, this man and woman have given their consent and made their marriage vows to each other. They have declared their marriage by the giving of rings. I therefore proclaim by the powers vested in me that they are husband and wife. You may kiss the bride. Hmm.
