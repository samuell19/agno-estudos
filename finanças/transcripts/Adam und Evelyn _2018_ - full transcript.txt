Good evening ladies and gentlemen. About 30 GDR citizens sought refuge in the embassy of the Federal Republic of Germany in Hungary. They hope to force their departure to the West in this way. After the closure of the Permanent Representatives of West Germany in East Berlin, the Embassy in Budapest has now also been closed. The capacity to take in prospective emigrants is said to be exhausted. There are more than 200 GDR citizens in the embassies. For weeks, certain West German forces have been responsible for rampant incitement against the GDR, especially in the media. They concentrate on the citizens of the GDR, who are illegally staying in German Embassies or in the Hungarian capital hoping to emigrate illegally. East Berlin. In a letter to state and party leader Honecker, the Federation of Protestant Churches in the GDR has called for reforms to be initiated. The reason for the rising number of people who wanted to leave the country was that overdue changes in society were denied... Meanwhile, more and more GDR citizens are trying to reach the West via the Hungarian-Austrian border. According to Hungarian sources, several hundred people were caught attempting to escape during the first days of August. Adam! Where are you? Adam! There you are. We went to church. Again? There was a reading of a text by someone they don't publish. And who was there? Everyone. Except you. Do I know her? You do. This is Uta. - What about her? - That's Bianca. Is this blue? Red. Silk. Hey, are those my shoes? None of them know anything about shoes. I don't want your girls wearing my shoes. When are we going? I'm not done yet. You'll never be finished. Want some compote? Apple or pear? You two. Only Adam is in paradise. I have the late shift. If you like the berries, you can have a whole box. This isn't from the GDR. That's Mona. I thought you'd be packing. You look great. See you later. Have fun! "Have fun"? - That's what he assumes. That we should have fun? - That we do have fun. Don't let me keep you. Nobody's coming anyway. Have a good holiday. Are you leaving tomorrow? You know Adam. You can't pry him loose from his work. One day more or less... I think he's only going on vacation because I want to. Lucky you. What about you? Michael is coming today. Are you excited? I am courted chivalrously. He holds the door open for me and so on. I'm not allowed to pay for anything and he gives me gifts. And? Is that nice? Sure, but it's nothing serious. What a waste it would've been if you had stayed with us. Nothing has changed. We still make awful clothes out of awful fabrics. Everyone's still there for now. It is 3PM. Time for the news at Radio GDR. Walk a bit. New activities in preparation for the 40th anniversary of the GDR were discussed by the working people of the heavy machine combine Magdeburg. In district delegates conferences... I feel like I'd actually have to give you a bunch of roses every time. You deserve an entire rose garden. 5PM. Deutschlandfunk/ Radio Germany. The news. Several hundred GDR citizens fled from Hungary to Austria in the afternoon. About 200 to 300 men and women... I didn't want to wake you. Don't let him talk you into anything. Can't we talk? You're a day late. I'm going with Simone. You can't be serious. - What should I do? - Nothing. Absolutely nothing. Nothing happened. According to official estimates, there are 200,000 GDR citizens in Hungary these days, and nobody knows how many of them have kept their true motives for choosing this holiday destination hidden. The fact is that at the Bonn embassy in Budapest there are still 171... Can I ride along for a bit? Sure. Where are we? Near Bratislava. You should change. Your clothes are damp. On the next camping site. It fits. Need anything else? - You're leaving? - I have to. Can you take me with you? Why not? But I don't have a visa. You are going where? - Lake Balaton. Holiday. Do you have anything to declare? - No. How much cash do you have? 200 Marks. 2000 Forint. Open up. Year? '61. Nice car. Voila. Cheers. Going down with class. The classy wardrobe of the Countess never appeared tawdry. What? That's what it says next to "class" in the dictionary. And you remember that? Michael remembers everything. Typical scientist. And Mona knows everything. Want to go dancing today? Maybe that will distract our pretty friend. Maybe you two want to do something without me. Is she a burden to us? Not at ll. It never occurred to me that they go on vacation in East Germany. Did you think we never take breaks? Or that we always do? Would you have come down here without Simone too? I can stand on my own two feet. You have nice feet. Charmer. Want to go swimming? I'm sure the cavalier will join you. Do you like it here? It has a certain charm. It's not as nice as the Baltic Sea. Look who I found! I already told Mr. Adam that we have the garden house for you, just like last time. The food. We'll go and get ready for the party. Congratulations. The departure of the 101 GDR citizens who were allowed to leave the country yesterday evening with the exit papers of the International Red Cross represents a special case in which the government acted for humanitarian reasons. Horn emphasized at the same time that those staying in Hungary do not fall into the category of the Geneva Refugee Convention because they are not politically persecuted in their homeland and they all have the desire to travel to a third country. You can't do this to the Angyals. Why are you doing this? You know what the worst thing is? That you always act as if nothing had anything to do with you. I have something for you. My jewelry. How did that get here? I thought you forgot it. Did you have to burden the Angyals with an entire travel group? Michael rented it. Perfectly normal. Or it will be completely different. Just wait. What would that change? That you have freedom. Freedom to choose where to live. That you can finally leave. Does it matter where you live? You can't see anything else. I always see new things. I don't even have to leave my garden. - That I believe. I thought we were on holiday. Now the serenity is gone. It was gone before this as well. Want to go to the lake? Good idea. Only if there's a bar. Look here! Mr. Adam! Isn't it magnificent? It belongs to a friend. Silk. I hardly dare to ask, but would you mind, despite being on holiday? You think I'm right for the job? - Bonjour. - Morning. I already have some. - Good morning. - Good morning. Would you like some? - Yes, please. - Coffee? - I could use some. It wasn't that bad yesterday, was it? Worse than you might think. Do you want to say something or should I? It's not that simple, Mona. She obviously wanted to tell you later. Will you take me to the train station? I don't want to disturb the lovebirds. Pardon me. I'm very happy, Mr. Adam. Very happy. At least someone is. I wish I was in New York with you. I would love to leave everything behind me. Don't you ever shave? Should I? In Rio you can go swimming at Christmas. Does it snow in Hamburg? Why wouldn't it? I just want to imagine it. It's more beautiful than you could imagine, Eve. You don't know what I'm imagining. What do you want in the West? What a question. A better life. Any kind of life. And so far you haven't lived? I supervised some children yesterday. 5 Western Marks per hour. I'll have your money tomorrow or the day after. Don't worry about it. My tank and canister are full. I can get home with that. Just a little further, please! Gone. It's all gone. - Everything? - Everything. Still, it was beautiful. No one can take that from us. Perhaps it was a sign. What kind of a sign? That we should make a fresh start together. With nothing. I need a new passport. Why just you? Mine is gone too. It's nice of you to take us. We have to pick up Katia from the camping site. You seem to do well with the ladies. She doesn't have a passport anymore either. Hello. I'm Michael. Katja. Evelyn. So they robbed you too, huh? They didn't even let me in. I'm supposed to come back tomorrow. They thought I was one of you. What now? How did it go with you? I wouldn't believe it if I hadn't been there. It worked. Replacement IDs and money. And they were friendly too. Well, nobody goes there voluntarily. What do you actually do? I'm a cell biologist. We're researching why we die. And? Why do we die? Cells reproduce, but not fully. Something is always lost. At some point there is so much missing that the cell dies. If cells were capable of loss-free reproduction, then we would live forever. We'll have it figured out in 40 or 50 years. And then? Then some people are mortal and others aren't? That's how it is already. Fear won't help anything. I'd be happy if I got to be as old as my turtle. It won't get older than 50. It's under too much stress. Didn't you know that? No. Adam is modest. The house, the garden, the neighbors... That's enough for him. His work is his only luxury. He indulges in it. I don't think that that's modest. Michael, on the other hand... If a man followed me around in a heap of junk like that, that would be quite something. Yeah. But what? Do you think I'd find work in the West? Why not? If you want to find work, you will. If you're good, you definitely will. Are you good? Yes. To me, working means living. What about you? I'm the same way. But we don't mean the same thing. - How so? Because I can do what I want. If a customer wants you to make a dress, then you can't make her a pantsuit. - Sure I can. If she looks better in one. Of course he didn't tell you that. Why would he? We don't know each other. He doesn't talk much in general. Do you want to study in the West? Nah. Do you? Art history maybe. I always wanted to. Or open up my own café. Believe it or not, but the Hungarians are opening their borders. Embassy people never talk, and if they say that much... They're setting up countless camps in Bavaria. They're expecting a mass migration. I'll believe it when I see it. We'll take you with us. You can do the administrative stuff together. It would be fantastic for Evelyn. You two could travel, go to the harbor, the fish market, the Alster, the museums... And we can meet up for lunch at a Portuguese place. Adam? And? It's working again. Come. Come! Quickly, quickly! From midnight onward - GDR citizens in Hungary are permitted to travel to any country that will take them in. Foreign Minister Horn has stated that the agreement with the GDR from 1969 is temporarily suspended. This is a provisional... Sorry. How long have you known you wanted to leave? Since this morning. I got so used to the thought of just not stopping. You can let me out here if you want. I said I'd bring you there. Have a seat! Would you perhaps like some coffee? Yes, thank you. Our savior. So. We tried everything. We tried different fuel pumps, but it won't work with any of them. What do we do now? Where are you headed? - Thank you. - You're welcome. If you would like anything else, please let me know. Bon appetit. I don't know. It might be complete junk, but it is pretty. Six thousand. - Six thousand? - Shillings. I don't mean to impose. It's just an idea. It might be for the best. You always said it was priceless. I'll be in the kitchen. A bible. Someone must've forgotten it. Or they put it there for us. For comfort, because we're refugees. He said, "I heard the sound of you" in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; "and I hid myself." He said, "Who told you that you were naked?" Have you eaten from the tree "of which I commanded you not to eat?" Adam said, "The woman" whom you gave to be with me, she gave me fruit from the tree, "and I ate." Then the Lord God said to the woman, "What is this that you have done?" The woman said, “The serpent tricked me, "and I ate." God said to the serpent, "Because you have done this, cursed are you" among all animals and among all wild creatures; upon your belly you shall go, and dust you shall eat all the days of your life. To the woman he said, “I will greatly increase your pangs in childbearing; in pain you shall bring forth children, "yet your desire shall be for your husband, and he shall rule over you." This is just lying around here. Would you like anything? No, thank you. Hello? It's Lutz. Yeah. We're in Austria. No, it wasn't planned. We just thought, if they're opening the borders we'd seize the opportunity. It won't be happening again anytime soon. Evelyn. Her name is Evelyn. Not yet, but who knows what the future holds. No, I don't know. Work, definitely work. I wants to go to university. I wanted to ask if we could meet up. So, maybe? Opposition groups in the GDR have registered in 11 of the 15 GDR districts with the responsible interior authorities to obtain legal status as a political unification. They demand reforms in the GDR. One statement said that the desire for justice, democracy, peace, and the protection and preservation of nature were at the center of all endeavors. Daimler Benz AG and the aerospace company Messerschmidt-Bolko-Blom have accepted the Minister of Economic Affairs' terms for a merger. A contentious issue was the assumption of the risks of MBB daughter Airbus. Daimler has to take it over in 1996. In addition, MBB has to leave the naval... You don't have to rinse the dishes beforehand. Just put it in. Cups, saucers and all the small things go in the upper compartment, cutlery goes back here. Just not the big knife. It has a wooden handle, see? Always do the wooden ones by hand. Bowls on top. It can handle that. It works best when it's full. Don't put the spoons next to each other, they stack up. The glasses I do again. I'd like to make myself useful. - Oh, Eva. I'm just glad you're here. We do the shopping with the car. And I get the rest when I come home from work. What about cleaning? Olivia comes on Mondays and Fridays to clean. Would you like some schnapps? Here. To you. To you both. To you being here. Cheers. That's not bad. I'm not worried about you. With your looks. Adam will have to start small, but when he gets going... Start small. - Name? - Schulmann, Evelyn. Born? - 19th of May, 1961. - Where? - In Torgau. Torgau, Saxony? - Yes. Torgau by the Elbe. Education? - Abitur, one and a half years of educational theory and waitressing since '88. Did you come by yourself? - No, with my partner. What's his name? - Lutz. - Surname? -Frenzel. How long have you known each other? Since 1987. Did you live together? - In his family home. He's lived there by himself since his father's death. And his profession? - A ladies' tailor. So, a master tailor. And how long have you wanted to leave the GDR? Always. Mr. Frenzel and you went to Hungary with the intention of using the opportunity? I wanted to go. - He didn't? - He followed. - You met there? - Yes. Were you afraid they wouldn't let you through together? We had a fight. Didn't he want to come? I don't want to talk about that. It was a private fight. Did he try to stop you? Not exactly. Not exactly? Why didn't he want you to enter the free world? I wouldn't say that. He wanted to be with me. That's why he came along. He didn't want to leave, but followed you. Yes. Did he make calls to the GDR while you were in Hungary? Not that I know of. Any contact to anybody that went back to the GDR? He brought a friend to the train. And she went back to the GDR. - Yes. Why? For private reasons. Perhaps not that private? It had to do with a man. With Mr. Frenzel. No, a man from West Germany. Who was in Hungary with you. - Yes. Could you give me his name? - No. You don't know it? - I do, but I won't tell you. Different question: Was Mr. Frenzel in contact with the GDR embassy? Why would he have been in contact? - It's a routine question. Did he? Yes, we were there. You were in the embassy? Yes, our passports and money had been stolen. Yours and Mr. Frenzel's? - Mine and an acquaintance's. The one from West Germany? - Yes. And what did Mr. Frenzel do? What did he do? He helped us. Could he have caused the situation that forced you to go to the embassy? You think he stole our passports? Why was Mr. Frenzel in the embassy with you? His papers weren't stolen. He accompanied us. Us? Surely your acquaintance had to go to a different embassy. A friend and me. That he brought to the train station. No, someone else. She's from East Germany too. She tried to swim across the Donau and lost everything. Did Mr. Frenzel tell you that? No, she did. Pretty strange story, don't you think? How did Mr. Frenzel meet this friend? He picked her up on the way and smuggled her across the border. Smuggled her? Across the border to Hungary. In the trunk. Our turtle too. Mr. Frenzel brought a woman across the border to Hungary in his trunk? Yes. Are you sure you know your boyfriend? What's that supposed to mean? To rephrase the question: Are you sure your estimation of him is correct? Do you think Adam is a spy? - Adam? Who is Adam? Mr. Frenzel. Everyone called him Adam. But the surname is correct? - This is ridiculous. Adam is the only person I know that only did what he wanted. No one could tell him what to do. And yet he wanted to stay in the GDR. Don't you find that contradictory? Adam loves me. Is that so hard to understand? This was a man and woman issue. Nothing else. Arabic. Say something. I'd rather not. Now you're off to Tunisia. Crazy, right? We've only known each other for 6 weeks. I still can't believe Adam came along. What's up? You look good. You're sweet. What do I say to you then? Nobody would guess you've only been here a few weeks from looking at you. Adam, on the other hand... he watches TV and is as clingy as a child. He has to get used to things. Sometimes he disappears for an entire day. No idea where to. Too much of everything, he says. Too many words, dresses, trousers. Too many cars, too much chocolate. Too much of everything. And everything is ugly. Ugly as sin. He's acting like he was born yesterday. Give him time to find a real job. I don't think they need tailors here. They buy everything off the rack. Even Gisela didn't want anything. She got him some clients in a tailoring course. A bunch of old ladies that want to spruce up their clothes, he says. Gisela's friend wanted a bow on each side of her dress. Apparently she looked like a fat bumblebee with tiny wings. Did he tell her that? No. But he did say he had no interest in such nonsense. I don't think he ever felt like he was working. The girls came, he made them pretty, and once they were pretty... Think he misses the ladies? I look at the men here and ask myself, "Why Adam?" I think I'd get along with anyone who was halfway nice. Why does it have to be Adam? What's going on, Evelyn? I'm having a baby. I know. How can you be so dumb? - Michael's? - Maybe. Or Adam's? Could be. Does he know? No. Would you like some pear? Some pear would be nice. For 28 years, since the construction of the Wall on August 13, 1961, we have longed for this day and hoped for it. We Germans are now the happiest people in the world. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. There is a festive mood on the streets of Berlin. Since the wall was opened 24 hours ago, over 100,000 GDR citizens are using the open borders to visit the western part of the city. The passages were also opened along the inner German border. At most border crossings the controls were completely eliminated. Long queues formed before banks and offices in which GDR citizens can receive their welcome money in the amount of 100 marks. The opening of the border was the biggest news story today in foreign media. I saw it all before my eyes, things I didn't think about because I'd never see it again. The gate, the garden, the house. I felt the cold wind whipping against Adam's face. The window in the door was cracked. How dark it became when Adam closed the door behind him. Broken dishes covered the kitchen floor, so he had to stop at the door to the kitchen. He had to lean against the living room door to open it. Something heavy scraped across the tiles. Once he had squeezed through the door gap, he saw what he'd expected: Nothing was left untouched. Torn up pictures lay about everywhere, and crumpled letters and bills. It took him hours to pick up the pictures, or what was left of them. He picked up pieces of broken records. He even managed to stand up the writing desk and put it back against the wall. Back in the hallway, Adam opened the door to the cellar. He grabbed the flashlight behind the door, went downstairs and shone the light around the darkroom. It was empty. Who was that? Crazy people? The Stasi? That's what I thought. But Adam said he saw his bicycle at his neighbor's house. Am I intruding? Katja wanted to know what happened. At least you're laughing again. I don't know if that qualifies as laughter. It was nice. Leaves everywhere. The quinces were glowing. What about you? I just wanted to say goodbye. Don't you like it here at all? What does that even mean. Just imagine: Early June. Sunshine. Blue sky. Green everywhere. And our child is born into the best world there has ever been. You believe that? Tell me when it's been better. What time would you want to go back to? Nobody has to be afraid of war anymore. Now they can use the money for things that are beneficial. Not just here. Around the whole world. People will only have to work 30 hours a week soon. People will do something useful for a year instead of military service. The wolf will live with the lamb. Why do you say that? Do you really think everything will keep going as it has? That would be absurd. Do you want tea or coffee? Doesn't matter. Tea or coffee? Whatever you're having. Tea it is.
