WITH/IN VOL.2 I can't believe we could get so many times in one night. It was amazing. You really are more than I bargained for. Oh, did you just think I'd be a bargain? I don't normally take guys home. Not that I regret it. Well, it's not my speed either, especially to feel like this about somebody so soon. I know. It's crazy. What time is your flight again? ONE NIGHT STAND Why do you have to fly now, of all times? Because it's where I live, where I keep my stuff. Yeah, but why now? We don't know what's gonna happen. -We might never see each other again. -Don't do this, please. We had such a good time, you know? Of course, we're gonna see each other. You don't know that. Things are changing so fast. Right. Then you come with me to LA. -I wasn't kidding when I asked you. -I can't do that. And next week it might be too late. You should stay. You're being so dramatic. Just knock it off. And you're being thoughtless and glib. It's a little early for you to be getting so needy, don't you think? Go to hell. -Get out of my house. Leave. -With pleasure. You're too old for me anyway. That's classy. Really. Thank you for that. I see I dodged a bullet. -Hey. -Hey. -So sorry I said that. -No. I'm sorry. Well, I'm glad you changed your mind. Yeah. There's that, and also there's a travel ban. So my flight... -You were inside the terminal? -Oh, it was a mad house. I see you got your luggage back from the hotel. When I went to the front desk, they said they were gonna close the place soon as I left. You should take a shower. Go take a shower. -You want me to take a shower? -Doesn't that sound nice? -Sure. -Go. I might meet you in there. Well, all right, then. What the fuck! Lady! What the fuck? It's only for 14 days. I'll use the guest bathroom. Get back here. Get back here. I'm gonna call the cops. Do you have my phone? No, haven't seen it. What is that? What the fuck is going on? Oh, come on. Scrambled again? Can you at least figure out how to cook an egg without burning it? Well, I don't cook and no one's delivering. So you might as well just get used to it. Oh, come on. Shut the fuck up! -What? -You know the drill. -Hands up. -Yeah. Beef Stroganoff. I never made it before. Did you know that Stroganoff was a Russian town? I eat that shit for breakfast? Thought you might like something to read to pass the time. You got anything from this year? You know what you're doing is illegal, right? Yeah, but what you did should be illegal. You went back to your hotel room. You got into a filthy cab. You actually even entered an international airport... All before bringing your germs back into my home. It was an Uber XL, actually. Black SUV. Oh, you just don't get it. Mom, you have to wear your mask all the time. Well, no. Look, I'm not trying to tell you what to do. I'm not. It's just that... And what did he say? Well, tell doctor... Tell him that you need it for four weeks, Mom. I'm not yelling at you. All I'm saying is that you should have it for four weeks. You don't know how long this thing is gonna take, that's all. Okay. And who's walking the dog right now? I left your dinner. Slow-poached chicken breast with bacon dust. And for dessert, a flaming strawberry flamb√©. Get it while it's hot. This is delicious. Glad you like it. How long does it take to slow poach a chicken? Not very long. It's only about 14 minutes. No kidding. I got it from a New York Times recipe. Thank you. You're welcome. Appreciate it. I get it now. I scared you. I get it. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Meet you at the door. It was thoughtless of me to come back. You know, never should have done it. My Uber driver was sneezing, I didn't even think about it. -Did you touch him? -Little bit. I mean, in the place he asked me to. I think I may have overreacted, too. Oh, you think so? Seriously. My Mom almost died from a virus when I was a kid. She was really sick for a long time and I think it just triggered something in me. Ah, it must have been awful. Yeah, and then I had to spoon-feed her Campbell soup for four weeks before she got any better. No wonder you're such a good cook. I think I just get scared when the people I love get sick. Not that I love you or anything, but I do care about you. -Well, we had a good thing going. -For 12 hours anyway. Still pretty hot. Your turn. What are you doing down there? Nothing you can't do to yourself. Oh, I can't wait to really touch you. How much longer do I have to spend in here? When did we meet again? April 10th. Another couple of days. That's too bad. So, what's for dinner? Well, we're all having to learn to live without our usual comforts and routines. I don't go for my routine shampoo and set. My roots are an absolute disaster. I mean, three and a half decades of having my nails done and then, lo and behold, I discover I can absolutely do it myself. I could have saved absolute fortunes. Alex. Alex, darling, are you smoking? No, Mom, I'm not smoking. -You sound like you're smoking. -Yeah, well, I'm not. -You're getting lots of rest? -I'm trying. Oh, I want to see Jack. Let me see him. How is it I go to video? How do I go to bloody video on this things? Oh, I know. Looks like something's happening. Hi. Just give me a sec, okay? I'm gonna go into the house. Doesn't look like a very nice day there. -Is it nice where you are? -Absolutely glorious day. That's nice. Okay. Yeah, look, there he is. Look at that. Look at the little face. Oh, he's just marvelous. Alex. Is that the wardrobe? What's he doing in the wardrobe? Mom, it's dark in here. -It's the only place he'll go to sleep. -Okay, I'm sorry. -For goodness sake. -Please don't wake him. Okay. Are you taking any exercise? Taking any fresh air? It will do you good. You look absolutely exhausted. Thank you. -Darling, I wish I was there with you. -Yeah, well, you're not. Honestly, I'd rather that you were alone, than with him. Mom. Leaving you alone at a time like this, what was he thinking of? Mom. Where is he anyway? Where do you think? Well, you know, just got to keep yourself busy. Distract yourself. Listen, no drinking, please. You know it makes you emotional. Mom, I'm hanging up now. I'm gonna hang up. Look, let me just say one thing. This is really important, 'cause I read about it. The deliveries. 72 hours quarantine. That's what they say, 72 hours. Alex. Alex, are you listening? Shut up. Better now? I got to go. Hey Siri. Set a timer for four minutes. Okay, four minutes and counting. Okay, stop. Stop. Okay. It's ready. Oh, fuck. Cereal it is. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. Hey Siri. Can you sing a lullaby? I'd rather leave that to the professionals. Okay. Yeah, thanks a lot, Siri. Medical catastrophe as rapidly increasing cases spread like wild fire across... Hey Siri. How many people died of COVID today in North America? Hey Siri, turn on the TV. Hey Siri. Turn on the TV. Hey Siri, set the timer for seven minutes. Playing Cartoon Network. Yeah, sure. Whatever. Good morning. Good morning, teacher. Good morning. Oh, how cute. Eat, eat, eat your egg Hey Siri. -Hello, Alex. -Play a lullaby. Playing lullaby. Thank you, Siri. It feels nice. You're welcome, Alex. Starting timer, 72 hours. Hey, I didn't ask you to do that. You're welcome, Alex. And what's with the British accent? I'm not sure I have an answer for that. I mean, it's fine. -Kinda like it. -How marvelous! Siri, this place is a mess. Would you like me to play some music for you? Yeah. That'd be great. Sleep can boost your immune system. That's great. Benefits of chamomile tea. Shut up, Siri. Hey Siri, turn the light back on. Setting alarm, 6:00 a.m. Fuck you, Siri! -Your alarm is now set for 6:00 a.m. -No, I don't want to go to bed! Don't worry, you got this! You are mooorvelous. What the fuck! Siri. Call David. I'm not sure I understand. This number is disconnected. Oh, you bitch! Would you like me to play some music? No, I want you to fuck off. Call David. Call David! Come on, Siri. Don't fuck with me! Goddamn it. You want to go in there? Do you want to go in there? Don't tempt me, you little bitch. Oh, shut the fuck up! Leave me alone! I'm coming. Mommy coming. -Hey Siri. -Good morning, Alex. -How's it going? -Oh, cute. Very funny. -Where is she? -I'm not sure what you mean. Oh, whatever, asshole. Just tell me how long to cook this fucking egg. Egg. Noun. An oval or round object laid by a female bird, reptile or fish or invertebrate, usually containing a developing embryo. Right, so, what? You're just going to mansplain me now? Mansplain. Verb. Of a man to explain something to someone, typically a woman, in a manner regarded as condescending or patro... Siri. Siri. Hello. -I'm listening. -Oh, thank God. How are you today? I'm fine. Thanks for asking. I'm sorry about last night. You must have a lot on your plate right now. I'm here to help. So, what's the weather like outside? The temperature is 21 degrees centigrade. Marvelous. Follow the path due north for 200 meters. In 50 meters, you will reach your destination. Marvelous. Bed soft and white. All the creatures of the day, need the rest from work and play. When the new day shall break, full of joy you will wake. Setting alarm, 06:00 a.m. Thank you, Siri. Good night, darling. Good night, darling. You're not even wearing gloves? Fuck off! NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH Thanks. So, you're fine here? No desperate desire to come and play Scrabble with the kids or something? Honey, I'd love to play Monopoly but I got to stop these fuckers touching my damn fence! He's still on the... Yup. It's your move. I reckon he's gone crazy. Am I being unreasonable or should he shave? He should shave, right? Or at least have a shower. What he should do is give it a rest and come back to the land of the living. I heard that. I still don't understand why us two can't just go back to the city and see people that are actually interesting. I mean, we can't even die of it. Well, I don't think it's a good idea. And even if I was to sign off on it, good luck getting pass the man upstairs. It's your turn. Hey, come on. -Come on. Wake up, wake up. -What? All right, so I got a pretty crazy idea, but you got to just indulge me for a second, all right? All right. Okay, so, we can both agree that we got to get out of this place, right? Sure. So why don't we just do it? Me, you, no Mum, and definitely no Dad. We can go to the city and we can see all our friends and it will pretty much just be exactly like normal. And Mum pretty much just signed off on it anyway. Okay, but fuck off. I'm trying to sleep. We should tie him up, so he doesn't wake up and screw the plan. Agreed. -Hey, could you stop that? -No. I know what we should do. Let's go and get some fresh air. Wait but by fresh air, do you mean just going out in the car and staying in the car? Hey, you want to come? We're going to go for a drive. Yeah. Maybe we could do it tonight, like maybe 11 p.m or something, when the front lawn activity goes down? I want you to step away from the fence. Step away from the fence. What is he doing? You know our doorbell that's got that camera and everything? It's got a two-way speaker. At least he came. Whatever, we're here now. Look how beautiful it is. Stop, what the hell do you think you're doing? -Going for a walk. -No. You can get fresh air from here. You'll get a tic in there and get Lyme's disease and die. Hey, don't go into the forest. You get a tic in there, and you get Lyme's disease and then die. Okay. I made you guys some cookies. I don't care how brave you're feeling. You could be asymptomatic. You could be running up and down my block, you could still be spreading it all over the place. Wait, is that the antibody test? It's unreliable. Fauci says the antibody test is unreliable. These are great, Mum. You keep staying outside my fence, and I'm watching you 14 days, then you can touch the fence. How about Monopoly? That takes ages, though. But we've got ages. Well, what else is there here? We could do a puzzle. That only takes a couple of days. No, we don't have time for a puzzle, do we? Okay, well, what else? There's Parcheesi. There's Risk. There's Sorry. I think there's Cl... yeah, there's Clue. We could play chess. Why don't we just play Go Fish. Go Fish. Okay. Yeah. Well, let's play Go Fish. Hey, you want to come and hang? Yup. Can I hang from up here? Totally, no, that's... Yeah, why not? We can hear you from down here. It's a great idea. One good thing is that, apparently only 6% of people can get it again, which means that New York will have herd immunity, or whatever you call it, really quite soon. So that's great. Mum, did you read that from the New York Times article this morning? -Yeah. -It was 60%, not 6%. Well, if you think about it, that's not... No, That isn't great. Do you have it? ...into quarantine, we are not out of the woods yet. And with the vaccine months away from approval, sheltering in place... Good luck, asshole. Did we get the time wrong or something? It's pretty cold. Yeah. -Did you bring a coat? -No. -Me neither. -But I brought this. Do you want to go home? Yeah. STILL LIFE It's Ethan. I assume internet outage. We're fine here. Still stuck in Paris. But I need to hear from you at some point. Jesse tested negative, which is really supreme. We are officially in her second trimester, officially. Call me, please. Hi, it's Peg. I sent you an email but I guess your satellite's still funky. Anyway, interest in the show is insane. I'm going ahead with the opening virtually. It's your dream. Online, you don't have to come. But we need to get the new pieces photographed like yesterday. Definitely the big stone one. Call me. Bye. Hi, it's Carl at the pharmacy. We have your prescriptions. Just pull up outside, and we'll bring them out. Helen, this goddamn wedding. Hey, I'm in a fix here. Postpone or cancel? Hey, what would you take? Valium, Xanax, Placidil... Hi, Mum. You really need to call. I know you're handling what you need to handle, the way you handle things. Ethan, I'm fine. Just busy. Helen. Pick up. Pick up. God damn it! Pick up! Pick up, pick up, pick up... Hello, Helen Feld. This is Chip at Betz Fabricate. We have the flanges and panels. Just need to confirm the delivery site and new protocols. Call me at 800-565-7555. I sent you an email, but your dealer said your internet is pretty spotty out there these days. Thanks. Look, I know I shouldn't worry, but I... That's right. You shouldn't worry. A boy? That's wonderful. I'll call him Jackie. How much do I owe you? Doctor says: Nothing, Jackie already paid me. Mrs. Feld, leave a message. Helen Feld, this is Rachel Gay from Art Union. I spoke with you a year ago, an interview, actually, which I don't know if you ever saw it, but it's quite nice. Brilliant, really. Thank god I've kept your number. We're doing this piece on how artists are living during this difficult time. Hi, it's Carl again from the pharmacy. Just wondering if you were coming by for your prescriptions. Just pull up outside and we'll bring them out. -Okay, let us know. -No more pills, Carl. Fuck you, Dave! Fuck you, Dave! My god, I mean criminal responsibilities. Don't think for one minute we're going to let you escape. We're going to throw you into jail. Now, that is a hole. Hiya. The festival is over And the boys were all planning for a fall -You're in a Dylan phase. -Never out of it, really. And yet, you don't know the words. -You're so god damn beautiful. -Oh, shut up. -And take off that mask. -Nope. Well, then fuck off. Because that's where he would lie when I was digging that pond. That's why the hole was there. -It was a pain in the ass to dig. -Why you'll appreciate it. Appreciate it. Oh brother. You know, Ethan and Jesse are having a baby. -But I guess you already know that. -I did not know that. It doesn't work that way, apparently. What do you think about that? I think it's a good thing. When you have a kid you stop being someone else's. I don't know if it's true. Oh, why would you agree with me now? I'm selling all the cows. All the blooded stock. And your tractors, and your implements, and all your tool sets. -Not my dad's socket set. -Especially your dad's socket set. Every god damn wrench. Pliers, spreaders, splitting maul. -Yeah, and give me that axe. -Oh, this is not mine. -This was issued. -Issued? Yeah, before that I got this really cool water pail. It's around somewhere. -Everything must go, buddy. -That is right. You're going to wait here while I go get him? He's right there, babe. Oh god. I'm so absent minded. -Yet so present bodied. -Shut up. Hey, see. Oh, buddy. Oh god. I miss that little dog. -You do? -Yeah, who would have thunk? Oh, he was a good dog. -Remember that time up on the... -Hush. Please. You need to work, Helen. Well, I can't. I can't work. I can't do anything. And I hate you. I hate you for missing this. All this... you just escaped this stupid, scary bullshit murderous time of a bloated fucking clown. You were just a lucky, dead, uninformed, complicit, complacent mother fucker. -Lucky? -Yeah, lucky. That's right. -You and your god damn heart. -It was a pretty good heart. -It was a bad heart. Bad. -Only there at the end. God, I wish you were here so I could kill you. -I can't do this. I can't do this! -Do what? Living! Living. Well, you're doing it, babe. It ain't me, Dave No, no, no It's ain't me, Dave It ain't Dave you're looking for, babe Go away from my window Leave at your own chosen speed You say you're looking for someone Who'd never take the last piece of cake Be right there. Frenchy, it's your deadbeat dad coming for the custody dog. Oh, come on, baby. Oh god! Baby Jane, what happened to you? Okay. -Hey, Claire. How are you doing? -Great. Frenchy no longer eats dog food. There's chicken and beef in the bag. Don't judge, Brian. He's old. You like your comforts. -Where's your mask? -It's in the car. -I put it on when I go in the stores. -Are you sure? Because every time I go into the supermarket and there's someone going cluelessly down the wrong aisle, it's usually a guy not wearing a mask, who thinks he's invulnerable. Well, I don't think I'm invulnerable. Good, because you're not. -Bye. -Bye, Frenchy. Remember our signal. I'll know if you don't get your treats. It's my allergies. -I don't have it. -I know. Shut up, shut up, shut up. Hello. Hello, my baby. Hello, my darling. How are you? Now what? He was howling in the car. I'd never heard him do that. -And I had to turn around. -Oh, my God. Are you okay, Frenchy? -Oh, my God. -I don't know. Howling? Well, he was now, and then he was whimpering after that, so... Oh, my God. I'll stay? -If it's okay? If you think so? -Okay, okay. -Just in case. -Yeah, yeah. -Come in. -Yeah, yeah. Yo, why don't you stay overnight until we know he's okay. What are you doing up? You're never up this early unless you're on a job. Honey, does that turkey wake you up every morning at 06:00 a.m.? He's needy. He's seeing his reflection in the window. He's beating his head against the window thinking it's another turkey. He runs toward me every morning like we're in a romance novel and I've come back from another century to be his and his alone. You're watching a lot of Outlander, huh? No. I think I have some wooden shutters in the shed I could put up for you and then he'd stop banging his head... Because it's impossible to think that I'd be his lover, right? It's impossible to think that I'd be anybody's lover. I'm just saying I could put up some shutters so you could sleep in. Okay. Let's hear the death count for today. ...confirmed cases in the US now. It's still the sound thing bugging you, huh? It's called "misophonia" and it's a real thing. It was pretty real to me. Oh, you believe it now? You said it was all in my head. In America, here are millions of dogs left in the cold. Sad dogs! Dogs in cages! Give me the remote! -You got the remote. -Oh, mute, mute, mute. I'm gonna go take a look in the shed and look for those wooden shutters. I have antihistamines. You don't have to suffer! So I don't have to suffer. Brian. -Nice idea. -We shouldn't be smoking, though. I've got edibles, I've got edibles. Over there. Smells so good. Good harvest? Abbondanza. -Let me show you. -Let me see. Smells so good, my God. Abbondanza! I gotta... I'm sorry. I gotta see this guy. Well, I think it's important for people to understand how the data comes in. A lot of the data that we're posting today, the testing or the fatality may have happened you know, five or six days ago. Stupid. What are you doin'? Spelling Bee. It's a word puzzle. I'm addicted. -I wanna play. -Yeah? Get a paper and pen. -What's this? A new puzzle? -Yeah. So would "Ramen" be a word? No, I told you, no proper names. -And anyway, there's an E. -Shit! -How many do you have? -I'm two points short of genius. -Well, let me see what you have. -No, not yet! No. I'm gonna make some tea. You want some? -No, thanks. -What did you do? Nice passive-aggressive move there, buddy. And I always liked that about you. Well, because you are, too. Just because you can spell. I can make spells, too. Remember when you were scared of me, because of my... Because of my double-jointed thumbs? You thought I was a witch. -And you remember when you... -Don't even. Jesus, come on, this is... this is almost genius. I put a spell on you. -Is it okay? -I'm gonna head to bed. I got ask you a question. How come these nuts drive you crazy but the turkey gobble sounds don't? I don't know. I don't know. Oh, man. -You drive me nuts! -I drive myself nuts! Goodnight. Goodnight. Come, my darlings, come. Come on. Your turkey husband sounds happy today. -You're jealous of a turkey now? -No, I am not. But I think Frenchy is. -Frenchy. -Yeah. You know, I think Frenchy's happier with me here. Yeah? Maybe we should try to watch something else. I'm beyond depressed looking at these death counts and social distancing for those lucky enough to still be alive. You wanna play that word game again? I don't know. You gonna scribble on my hand again? I don't know. I might. Okay, I'll set up the computer. You can do four letter words. Proper names are still not allowed. No eating nuts! Oh, see, that's... that's what I wanna talk to you about. -Nuts? -Yeah, social distancing. Look, I think we like each other enough to socially distance while I'm eating any loud food. If I'm eating nuts or an apple, okay? Or any loud food. What if I said, "I'll make a pact with you to socially distance for loud food"? If I eat an apple, I'll stand over here. And nuts, anything. Otherwise, Claire... Pact? -One more thing to seal the deal. -What? We unplug. We unplug. TWENTY QUESTIONS What I've learned is just how isolated I was before all this happened. I love the quiet. I love being with my own thoughts, keeping my own counsel, not racing around. I have so much time. It's such a relief. What was I rushing around for before? There's nothing to do. I owe my mother a call. It's been weeks and she's all alone. Loneliness is the central and inevitable fact of human existence. Title loneliness is the central and inevitable factor of human existence. Someone's at my door. Who is it? It's the mailman. He's a nice, simple guy with a crush on me. Talks to me about World Cup soccer sometimes. Maybe I could ask him in for a coffee, take things from there. Would I feel guilty if everyone's packages were late because I started a torrid affair with the mailman? It could be awkward if it didn't go well. My mind was always racing before. So many deadlines. Now it's calm. It's because of the amount of sleep I've been getting. Not setting the alarm in the morning is the greatest gift. I should have gotten a dog. Even a rescue dog. But some of them are so crazy, like that lady that comes by the public pool with that dog that barks at anyone who tries to swim. What a nightmare! I'm so horny. I shouldn't have broken up with my boyfriend before all this. I blame myself. I miss my housekeeper. I wish something would happen. I killed two people today. One more makes zero difference. Don't scream. ...issued a stern warning to neighbors in the immediate vicinity of Green Valley to be on high alert and on the lookout for escaped inmate Paula Mariah Roback, who is unstable, violent, and extremely dangerous. Sheriff Prosky begged the people not to try and take matters into their own hands, but rather call the office immediately, so they can apprehend the suspect without further bloodshed. Paula Mariah Roback has a long and terrifying history of mental illness... Harkening back to her early teens... You call me that and I'll hurt you. Understand? My mother was a tone-deaf hoebag with no taste. Couldn't decide who she liked better, Paula Abdul or Mariah Carey. So, I was stuck with a shit childhood and learned to mop up the floor with lippy bitches before I learned to read. Came up with my own brand of Super Karate. My whole life, I've been fighting, so that's what my identity's based on. That's what the nice lady shrink keeps reminding me. What's your name? Leslie? Ivy. -Are you gonna scream again? -No. -You lying? -No. Well? What? What's your name? -Ivy. -That's your Christian name? -No. -What'd your parents call you? -Yvonne. -What I mean right there. Yvonne sounds like a brand of tampon. School was no walk in the park for you, I bet. I borrowed your dress. Smells really good. The only good thing to come out of all this is that you can go anywhere wearing a mask and nobody knows you're there to rob 'em till the last second. That's the only thing I'm gonna miss. You know gun shops are on the essential list now? Sex shops, too. Someone has their priorities straight. Do you have a gun? What am I asking? Of course, you don't. If you had a gun, you wouldn't have faced an intruder with an umbrella. How was that supposed to work? Were you gonna stick the umbrella up the guy's ass and press the button, hoping it'd open and paralyzed him? I wasn't... thinking. No kidding. A little home protection goes a long way. You can't keep me tied up like this. -People will come looking for me. -What people? People. Because you're alone in the world doesn't mean I don't have any friends. You don't have to be a dick about it. My arms are numb. I can't feel my wrists. I have no blood circulation. I get sad when it rains. Having a rough life is no excuse to go around terrorizing people. What do you know about rough? -There's a lot you don't know about me. -Like what? One thing. -Were you raised dirt poor on a farm? -What if I was? So was I. Did your mother die in a gruesome tractor accident with your dad behind the wheel, because they were both drunk? Did your one-armed uncle smuggle cigarettes and moonshine on a speed boat? There was a speed boat in a farm? The farm was next to a lake. It's like they say, truth is stranger than fiction. Huh, come on. Don't give me that. Of course, truth is stranger than fiction. Fiction has to make sense. I'm not here for your entertainment. Stay focused. I'm so sorry that took longer than I meant. Oh my God. Are you alright? I am so sorry. I know what it feels to be left betrayed, abandoned, and humiliated. When I was 12, I was abducted by a white supremacist biker gang of Satan worshippers. The nice lady shrink says all my trauma stemmed from that moment. The fabric of my reality was torn or something. They meant to use me in a blood sacrifice ritual, and tied me up to this makeshift altar, and lit this big bonfire where they intended to cook me. I remember trembling, my whole body just vibrating, almost levitating. And I suppose I went into a trance. My mind went blank and focused on one simple thought. Complete and total annihilation. This staggering feat of derring-do, one shell-shocked 12-year-old versus five twisted and depraved white supremacist Satan worshippers was reported on the news by a nasty blonde bitch who never quit smiling as she described the way I massacred, with my bare little hands, those evil bikers. Which is why I can't stand the news. Or Nazis. Or heavy metal bands. Or motorcycles. Which is why I broke your TV. I'm sorry for that. I gotta say, most women don't look great in that, but you do. Seriously. Plus, you have amazing boobs. Come on, have you never wanted to be somebody's love slave? All women like a little rough trade from time to time. We're all getting a little testy. Oh, boy, I'm sweating like a nun in a cucumber field. You wanna play 20 questions with me? Who's that? -Who is that? -The mailman? -Why is he knocking on your door? -He must need something signed. -Hey. -Hey there. I don't mean to bother you, but did I drop off a package for 513 here yesterday by mistake? No. Also, I know you get this all the time, but I'm a huge fan of your work. Help me. Excuse me? I need help. Thanks so much. You shouldn't have done that. What do you think I did? Something funny. -Did you do something funny? -No. -Were you a bad little bunny, Yvonne? -No. Did you maybe ask the mailman for help? No. I wasn't born yesterday. I'm a little lost. I don't understand the things happening around me. I have experience, but little wisdom. This in itself is not unheard of. I've been told this is a sign of the times, a by-product of the hostile world we live in, a world adrift. It doesn't make me feel better about it. I don't wanna give up yet. Even if no one sings me love songs. Even if I don't yet have a convincing beginning for my new novel. I want to live. I want to bloom like a flower. And touch other people. Strangers. Touch their faces, and their hands, and hug them dangerously tight. LONLINESS IS THE CENTRAL AND INEVITABLE FACT OF HUMAN EXISTENCE. I KILLED TWO PEOPLE TODAY, ONE MORE MAKES ZERO DIFFERENCE. DON'T SCREAM. This feels special. We should do it more often. Is it? It is to me. I'd like to do it more often. Me, too. So nice without screens. That reminds me... TOUCHING ...I have a Zoom at 7:00. I should just... -Check if people have replied. -Can we not? Can we just carry on with this? You know, the specialness? -While it's still... -Special? Right. -Can you not do that? -What? -With your foot. -I was here first. -What difference does that make? -So I can move my foot where I like. Not if I'm here now. I'm here now and I don't want your foot invading my space. But it was my space before you came. I had all of this space. Then you occupied it and took my space that I had saved for moving my foot into. -You sound like Israel. -Can you please move it? Or maybe it's Palestine. Maybe it's Palestine. It feels like it was originally their space. You have to share the space. -Says the UN. -Please move it. -Your nails are so sharp! Israel! -No, you're Israel! -I thought you said I was Palestine! -Can you please just both stop? This was special. Can we just keep it that way for a minute before we start... -Invading each other or... -Take up more space than we need. Or start coming in and taking over perfectly happy people. -Dad? -Please, both of you. Can we not just all... Try and find a two-cushion solution, please. Dad? -Dad? -Yes! What? I'm right here! Is she Israel? If you got something to ask, you don't always need to keep saying "dad". You have my attention just by talking, without always... Dad? Sorry, I did not mean to do that. Say "dad", I mean. Oh, be quiet. Dad, sorry, is she Israel if I was here first? -Stop calling me "Israel"! -You don't even know what it means! -It means that I was there! -Just a stupid... quiet! -Stop it, stop it! -Stop antagonizing. -I want to learn! -You scratched me again! You space-invading poo puncher! Okay, okay, you come over here. -Why do I have to move? -Just please come here. Daddy? -Am I Israel? -No. Honestly, I don't know. -She can say "daddy" but I can't. -Can you stop please? No, I think I got myself in a bit of muddle with this one. I think both Israel and Palestine think that they were there first. I think. You okay? You okay, mum? -It's pretty complicated. -I'm sorry. -It's not you. -Oh, love. Darlin'. I was just reading this beautiful thing about someone dying alone. Their family isn't allowed to be with them and... I just got scared for that ever happening to us, to people we love. To my Dad. Or Granny. What about when granny was a little girl, all alone in the hospital with scarlet fever. -What was she, 8? -6, I think. Isolated for six months? -I think it was 8. -Whatever. All that time, on her own! Her mom and dad waving at her through a window in the door. Terrified all the time. And if we ever had to mourn alone... Separately, not together, I don't think I could take it. All the things we do when someone dies we do together. Talk. Drink. Tell stories. Hold someone's hand. This is getting a little uncomfortable. Do you think you could get off? -Sorry, sorry, sorry. -It's okay. I've got a great idea! Hey Siri, play Alexandra by Hamilton Leithauser. For old times' sake. That's good. It's just about science! Why won't they listen to the science? Does he really believe that? Did you hear that? Oh, it's the Washington death cult! It's just about science! Why won't they listen to the science? That's the hospital where Ben was born. Lousy parking. Hi, dad. Sorry, the TV's on and Ben's playing his guitar. You all right? You should have stayed. No, dad, please use your walker. We wanna come get you, but you gotta let your hip heal first. So that means you gotta move every day, only with your walker and with Kimmy. Are you seeing this? They don't even have a plan! If you do that, you're gonna fall again, and if you fall again... No, dad, that's why you can't fire Kimmy. -Doctors say one thing and then... -Matt, please. Ben. That's our home, Ben. We have to pay attention. No, dad. Dad, you're not listening to me. -If you do that... -Ben. Ben! No, dad. No, please. Hang on a second. We should go with him, he might get lost. I'll call you back after your nap, dad. -He's pissed, isn't he? -So am I. I hate it here. Coyotes, at night, freaked me out. My dad's gonna fall again. Where is he going? I don't know. Maybe he's walking back to the city. My back is killing me. I think the mattress in that place is from the 1950s. Stop complaining. I think the plumbing is from the '50s, too. -Do you think Ben seems anxious? -No, he seems pissed. -You're the one that seems anxious. -Well, I am anxious about my dad. -Kimmy says his feet are getting worse. -Then go back, you can see your dad. I don't wanna go back. How could we use the elevator? How can Ben see his friends? You know he's gonna wanna see his friends. -You wanna open that Pandora's Box? -But your dad. Don't use my guilt about my dad to get me to go back right now. -That is not fair. -Don't be so defensive. -I'm not being defensive! -Look, we can't stay here forever. Henry's gonna start charging us rent as soon as the state reopens. -He's doing us a favor. -So we pay it. Are you kidding me? We can barely afford our rent back home. We need to start getting better about food. What? His teeth are hurting, he broke his braces. -I know that. -So I'll take him back to the city. And then the orthodontist sticks his hands in his mouth? Do you know how unsafe that is? We spent a lot of money on those braces. We can't start over again. Why do you keep making this all about money? Why won't you acknowledge that it's an issue? If you'd have taken that transfer six months ago, you wouldn't have been laid off right now. How could I see that the world was about to implode. It's an emergency, it's his health. Like your dad. -So I'll take him alone. -And then we're separated? No. Ben, you have to tell us how bad your teeth... Where is he? Ben! Ben? Ben! I'm right here. Ben! We get too loud? Now you please be quiet. Can you show me the way home? Dad. Dad, please use your walker. Have you seen this thing? They even have no beds! IN THE AIR As the domestic death count exceeds 34,000, the disaster in nursing homes, the tip that led law enforcement to 18 bodies at one facility's tiny mooring, more than 5,600 residents dead across the US, families begging for... SHELL GAME -Do you think he's coming back? -I have no idea. I've been thinking a lot about what you told me. How like attracts like and how the frequency that you put out in the world is what comes back at you. I mean oh my God. That's disturbing! I mean this guy's the most selfish asshole I've ever met. What does that say about me? You know me. I just have this thing where I need to fix people. I'm a fixer. I don't know. I see a fucked up guy and I have this crazy impulse to make him eggs. Do you think Lester's gonna come back? Don't answer. I don't care, I give a shit. He shouldn't come back. I don't care. The guy is driving me crazy, clearly, and it's just there's so much uncertainty in the world. Why do I even want him back here? I don't know. It's like there's some fucking invisible cosmic noose wrapped around my neck, pulling me towards some sort of form of punishment or some sort of torture or something and... I sound like I'm a masochist, right? We've established that. I mean you don't think I'm a masochist, do you? Oh no! I mean you seem to avoid pain at all costs. Right. Exactly. I mean I don't understand why I'm staying with this guy. Why do I keep going back to him? It's like why be with someone who doesn't treat me the way I deserve to be treated? It's the age-old question right behind, "Why are we here?" "What is our purpose in life?" Why do I stay with this guy? Oh my God, I sound like such a cliche. Really, I mean this is embarrassing. You tell me to be authentic. You say I could say absolutely anything I want to, so here you go. But really, truly, I mean honestly, I just... I feel ashamed. I should be so much further along than I am right now. Don't be so hard on yourself. Oh my God! Did I tell you about Saskatchewan? I can't believe I didn't tell you this. Oh, but this is exactly... Okay, remember I was in Saskatchewan right before this whole lock down thing happened? Well, I went to the Museum of um, Natural history uh, or Science or Archeology, I don't know. It was the only place that was open on a Sunday. And so I go there, and I have to tell you like all week long, I was kind of freaking out, because that memory of my sister, remember the one that I'm like pounding on the door, and pounding on the door, pounding on the door, like, "Let me in." Like, "Let me in, let me in!" And she's not letting me in and... Listen I know we've been through this ad nauseam. Like I get it. She's not letting me in. It's like the way this you know, fuck face isn't letting me in and I'm, "Why do I need someone to let me in? Why can't I let myself in?" I mean sure she locks the door, but why don't I just have a key? If I have a key, I could let myself in. Anyway, so inside the building... inside the building, there was a giant kaleidoscope, okay? And like you like kinda walk in and then under, and then you're inside the kaleidoscope, like surrounded by all these shattered lights, all these fractured mirrors. And somehow, when I went in there, like it hit... like it hit me really hard. I was weeping. I mean it felt so real that I could feel how tense I was. You know, how desperate I was to gettin' to the door. And as I'm pounding on the door and my sister like, "Let me in!" it hit me so hard. I mean I don't know. I mean maybe it was the mushrooms, because I had taken them right before I got there, but I don't think so. You know, it was more than that. There was some thing that unlocked like this little knack, bugging me. Why in my subconscious do I keep thinking about this moment that I'm pounding and pounding, and crying, crying? And all of a sudden, I saw the end of the scene. She let me in, but when she let me in, she's really mean to me. She was just like, "Oh, if you come in, you have to do exactly what I say", in this kinda really sadistic sort of way. But if it meant getting into the room, I had to take it. I had to take it. And it just means like love you know, goes hand in hand with bein' treated like shit, I guess. She represented love and safety in a house where no one was home. You're scared, and lonely, and seeking protection. You took what was offered. That's the seed of your struggle right there. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. It's pretty fucking heavy. That's been your pattern. And now that you know that, you don't wanna reinforce the pattern by accepting the bad behavior Les is offering you. Right. Oh, I totally get this. So if he comes back, I should tell him to leave? Oh, I don't want to be alone now. Now's not the best time for that. Who wants that? It's scary out there. The whole "Ooh, I need some space" thing, is such bullshit. "Oh, it's spring time. I think I have to wander." Fuck you. I mean if he really loved me, he would stay. But if I really loved myself, I'd ask him to leave. -It's a confusing time for everybody. -The shells were a sign. What shells? I didn't tell you about the shells? When it was finally okay to go outside, we decided to go to the beach you know, get some fresh air. And on the shore, I found the most amazing open shells. They look like these little butterflies. And it seemed like a symbol of hope or something that maybe we've evolved, turned into something really wonderful. But when I looked at them this morning, they'd all broken apart. Oh, everything feels so scary to me right now. I just wanna feel safe, loved. Is that asking for too much? And I know he's been texting his ex. -How do you know that? -Because I heard her ding. I know. I could tell her ding anywhere. I mean her ding lingers like bad perfume. Oh yeah, it's definitely her. And then when I confronted him with it, he totally tried to gaslight me. Told me that I was crazy. -You're not crazy. -I know I'm not crazy. -You're definitely not crazy. -I know! -You're the sanest person I know. -I know. I mean I caught him lying. Lying's not cool. Fuck him. Fuck him. His smell changes when he lies. Yeah, and he shuffles his feet when he feels guilty about something. How come you've never said anything like that to me before? I don't know. You seemed to take him and I tried to be supportive. Well, you know, it is what it is. I mean it's good that we know all this stuff, right? I mean it's sad. But as they say, it's always darkest before dawn. That's the time when you like to eat your crunchy cereal. Why don't we get into bed and watch Chernobyl again? That always seems to cheer you up. Yeah, that sounds good. Things will work out. Yeah, they always do.
