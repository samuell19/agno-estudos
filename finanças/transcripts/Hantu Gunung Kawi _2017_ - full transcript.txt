The Ghost of Mount Kawi. Dika. -Yes? Try checking. -Why me? You go ahead and do it. I would like to ask. Have you ever met our friend? Her name is Lisa. Adit! Get out quickly. I can't stand it anymore. Yes, hold on. What's with you? -You stink! Why would I stink? I just had a bath. What have you been doing inside for so long? Sorry, I fell asleep. Lately,... ...I've been having trouble sleeping. You do remember what... ...happened to us at school, right? It was scary, you know? Don't think about it! It's scary. -What? Scary. Anyway, after I looked into it,... ...Indonesian ghosts are really ugly. They have no manners. In contrast to the ghosts of foreign countries. It's been said, they're nice, handsome and wear suits and gowns. While those in Indonesia don't give any warnings. For those with heart problems, they'd die. Everywhere, ghosts would do that. There are no ghosts that..... -There are. Vampires would "hi, hi, hi". You just haven't met one. There are others that are different. That's how kids these days laugh. Vieuw, if my parents haven't returned,... ...I can stay at your place again, right? Sure but don't tell others that... ...you're staying at my place. They might think we're H.H.C. What? H.H.C.? -Yes, Happy Homosexual Couple. I can't be bothered! I'm also annoyed at you! Please find a partner. So, you won't be single for such a long time. I'm certainly single but I choose to be single. You? You're dating a buffalo calf. But let me think. So, did you think about it? Yes. -Well? What you said is true. Similar but I don't care, Adit. I sincerely love Indah. Let's say I do marry her and my child has a rhino body,... ...a buffalo face, I don't care. I love her personality. I salute you. Nur! -These two boys... ...are still chatting. Hey! The sun is up! You boys still haven't gone to school. Just asking, Uncle. This parrot can talk, right? Not only can this parrot talk, it can sing. It can sing even Metallica songs! -It has a nice voice. What more, Dangdut songs, it is indeed a champion. Try to sing. Please sing. -You're so smart. Ouch! Ouch! -If you're schooling,... ...do it properly. Don't just hang around. This is a parrot not a cockatoo. It can't sing, it can't talk. Do you understand? -Yes, understand, Uncle. Gosh! Magic. Dad, the bird has disappeared. Where did it go? What? The bird is here. -No, it's not. It has disappeared! It was there a minute ago. The two of you just kept asking me to talk. Now my champion bird is gone! Brontok! Brontok! Where is it? Brontok! Hey, hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Why is there something moving? What's inside? Try making that sound again. It's moving in there. Ouch! Don't tell me some sword play is happening. I'm afraid I'll be bitten. Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Please help. -Sorry, Boss. I'm in a hurry. Sorry, Boss! I must leave, Boss. Hey! Please help. Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Here are the bananas, Uncle. -Thank you, Bella. Where are you going? Sit down. Sit down. Accompany me. Dad, I seek my leave, all right? Now this is a banana. White, clean, plump. Why? Astonished? Astonished seeing me eat banana peel? Dad, I've noticed this past week... ...that you've been eating fruit skins. Your father just recently likes to eat fruit skins. Uncle, actually... ...what has been bothering your mind lately? Uncle, you can share with Dika and me. Who knows we can figure out the problem together. You're awesome. You flatter yourself! You're just a freshman... ...and you want to be my psychiatrist? Don't flatter yourself! Dad, don't be too cynical towards Bella. Tell your cousin not to talk too much! It's boring! She gives me headache! Enough of that, Dika. You just go to school. I'm all right. Yes, all right. If so,... ...I'll go to school now, all right? Have fun learning,... ...respect your teachers and don't forget to have fun. Bella, I leave my father in your care, all right? Don't, Uncle. -Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Otherwise, I'll sew your mouth shut! Jono! Gosh! This is a sack of rice but why wasn't a trolley used? What's with you, Jono? -Who are you looking for... ...causing you to run like that? -Have you seen... ...Vieuw, my sweetheart? Has he arrived yet? How come he hasn't been seen yet, Jono? Your sweetheart who thinks he's half Thai,... ...half matured? Whose shape is stocky like a round eggplant? Anyway, the two of you, right? If I say so myself, are suitable. Both are an unfortunate couple. -Why unfortunate? That boyfriend of yours, right? Who is short, stocky,... ...squirrel's tail, big nose, got you, is obviously unfortunate. Your shape which is like a Chinese cat,... ...got him, unfortunate too. So, you two are suited for each other. Do you understand? -No. Jono, do you understand? -Me again. Of course, I don't. -What a punk! May peace be upon you. -Vieuw? Adit? Guys, there's something I want to tell you guys. What's up? -My father's cigarette factory... ...that he ran all this time has gone bankrupt. Oh, gosh! Why? No one wants to work with my father anymore. All the banks have lost faith. In fact,... ...many employees' salaries have not been paid yet. Oh, gosh. I feel sorry for you, Man. Be patient. All right, Bro? Now my father has gone crazy. Depressed and often hallucinating. Your father must be devastated, right? Wasn't that factory your family's main income... ...that you guys have run for a long time? Last week, exactly after we were terrorized on the second floor,... ...Bella and I found something. Dika. -Yes? Come here. Gosh! -That's weird, Man! So, you think your father was doing black magic to get rich. Yes, that's what Bella and I are thinking. So, that means the closure of your father's factory... ...had something to do with doing black magic to get rich? Yes, it seems so, Vieuw. My father seems to have broken an agreement. I also don't know how it happened but suddenly... ...my father's cigarette factory has been closed forever. Have you tried to take your father to shamans? Yes! That's right. -That's the thing, not yet. Because of that, I want to ask you both... ...to follow me to Mount Kawi. Mount Kawi -Mount Kawi? Oh, no. No, no. -I refuse! I refuse! Scary! Do you know what Mount Kawi is? Well, what is it? -Sorry, sorry not possible. Excuse me. -Oh, yes. Go ahead. So beautiful. -A new girl, is it? So, how about it? -I can't come. Sorry. Vieuw? Vieuw! Adit. I'm sorry, Man. I'm not mentally prepared... ...to go to Mount Kawi. Don't you remember... ...our incident on the 2nd floor? I'm still scared. Sorry, okay? But Adit..... -Good luck, good luck. Adit, please. -Good luck. Adit? -Sorry, sorry, sorry. Adit! Adit! You said, we're best friends. Dika, hi. -Hi, Rebecca. Hey, why do you seem so down? I have a problem now. I want to express my feelings. May I? Hey! Hey! Hold on. Wait. You're a new student, right? -Yes. Hi, I'm Vieuw. The kids here say that... ...I'm the coolest and the most popular here. So, you're getting to know the right person. I'm Shyalimar. -I'm Vieuw. Do you know where your class is? I do. It's the one over there, right? The one at the end there. B Class. -The B Class that's over there? Yes. -All right then. If so,... ...just go with me. -Hey! Hey! Hey! You're a new student, right? -Yes. Hi, my name is Adit. -Her name is Shyalimar. Shya..... -Shyalimar. Shyalimar. Hi. Vieuw, don't you have a girlfriend? I think, she's waiting for you over there. Adit, you don't have to start that again. What's with you? Shyalimar, this is my friend. His name is Adit. He loves being like this, likes to joke. What more,... ...with new students. He likes to be flattered. Hey, Adit. Put it this way, all right? You better go there. I saw Indah, the gorilla kid, your girlfriend... ...already waiting for you over there, okay? Now I want to send Shyalimar to class. Let's go. -Hey? Hey? This is for Vieuw. Hey! Have you guys seen Vieuw? B Class. -Yes, this is my class. Thank you for sending me. -You're welcome. My class is over there, all right? That one. All right then. If so, I'll go in now, all right? Yes. Hey, Shyalimar. Later during recess,... ...may I treat you to a meal? Yes, yes, yes. -How do we do this? Enough of that, don't feel uncomfortable. Like this,... ...you're new in this school, right? You surely wouldn't know... ...which food are delicious and at the same time,... ...this school is big and vast. So, if you need to know..... I want to tell you..... I want to tell you what this school is like. I've been looking for you, it turns out you're here, is it? You're seducing a girl? Good, keep it up. Who is that girl? -That's..... All right then. If so, put it this way. It's best that you treat her to a meal, I'll go in now. Thank you, all right? Sweetheart, forgive me. You are terrible. I took all the trouble, instead he was seducing another girl! Sweetheart? Sweetheart, don't be angry. -Shut up! I just found out that apparently behind my back,... ...you were instead seducing another girl,... ...seducing a new student. She's not the same level as me. Apparently, you're a seducer! Unfaithful. Sweetheart, I've nothing to do with Shyalimar, that new student. I was just..... -Just wanted to treat her... ...at the canteen, right? Are you rich? Have a lot of money? Earlier, I made a cake specifically for you,... ...something special. -Wow! Thank you, Sweetheart. But because you seduced that girl,... ...so I'm not willing that this cake be eaten by you... ...as you're unfaithful. Fendi, this is for you. Eat it, okay? Yes. Thank you. -Don't be angry, Sweetheart. Don't touch me! -Hey! Don't eat that! Hey! Sweetheart, please don't be angry. You're beautiful. Stop it both of you. What is this? Have you lost... ...your sense of loyalty? Your friend is in trouble. But you guys are having fun here. -What fun are you talking about? Where's the fun? We are fighting. Can't you see? Anyway, who is it? Dika. He was telling me his problem just now. But he said you guys just didn't care. Dika? What about Dika? -Not Dika. But his dad. Did you know that his dad's factory went bankrupt? What? Bankrupt? -Yes, I heard him say it was... ...because he had stopped sacrificing humans for the sake... ...of a pact with the devil! -What? Sacrificing humans? That's so scary! Oh, gosh! I'm here for you. -Hey! Hey! You two are fighting, is it? -Adit, do you know? Dika's story is so creepy. His dad sacrificed human beings. I'm afraid, it's so creepy. That's right, Adit. -Yes, yes, yes. That's good. Just lean back, think of her like a pillow. Hey, you're hugging Adit, right? If you want to break up, say it. No need to do all these things! -Hey, what's up? Not happy? You don't like it? You're the only one who can do it? I can too. You wanted to treat Shyalimar at the canteen. I've no intention whatsoever with Shyalimar. I just wanted to compare. Then, just give it a try. Isn't that the intention? -But I love you. Gosh! Enough, guys! Can you stop all your dramas? We must focus on our friend Dika. I know Dika's problem. I do want to help. But I don't want to go to Mount Kawi,... ...that's creepy, you know? -Yes,... ...I'm scared to go there too. Because of that, we must... ...find another solution. -There aren't any, Adit. That's the only solution,... ...we must go to that mountain. Anyway, come on, guys. Dika is often good to us. He likes to treat us, watch movies. Isn't that right? -Yes, yes. I want to help Dika. Really pity him. Although I'm scared, all right? You guys imagine, what Dika is going through now... ...happened to our family. He was willing to associate with supernatural beings... ...to make his family happy, even though he knew it was wrong. Pity Dika, isn't it? -Yes, what a pity. He's just a victim, you know? Hey! Hey! Hey! You watch out! You watch out. -Anyway, you were the one who... ...was close to another girl. -Don't mention it again. Hey, be careful. I feel sorry for Dika. Gosh! Enough of that. Whatever it is, I don't want to know! All of you must come along. Come on, let's go see Dika. Yes, come on. Let's go. Bella! Bella! Bella! Bella! -What is it, Uncle? Look at this. It's bleeding. You fed me light bulbs. Look at that. All of this is bleeding. -Your mouth isn't bleeding, Uncle. This is bleeding! It's bleeding. I ate a light bulb. Look at this! This is a light bulb. Look at this. Uncle. This is an apple, Uncle. -Look at it properly! It's not an apple! It's a light bulb! Look at my mouth. Please look at it. -Uncle, you ate an apple. Look at it properly. Have a look at it. What? What? Have a look at it properly. What is that? Have a look at it! Have a look at it! -It's a light bulb, Uncle. Yes, isn't that a light bulb? No point talking to you! Enough of that! Go away! Come on. -Yes, come on. Adit, we want to accompany you. When are you going to Mount Kawi? Just a moment. I didn't hear that wrong? Of course not! Aren't we very good friends? Yes, it's true. -We're very good friends. Isn't that right? -That's how it should be. All right then. Calm down. Now it's just you. You told me you've never ever... ...been to Mount Kawi. Well, in my opinion,... ...we need someone who has certainly been there,... ...who knows the ins and outs of Mount Kawi. Who is that person? Jono! -Jono! Hey! Talking about this, how much are you paying me... ...to be your guide to Mount Kawi? Jono, if it's about that, you just come,... ...everything would be covered. -If there's a money factor,... ...I'll just come along. -But Jono,... ...you really have been to Mount Kawi, haven't you? Before I became a security guard,... ...I worked there for a month. A month? What sort of work did you do there? What are you? A puppeteer? It's true, I worked there for a month. What did you do, Jono? -I worked there... ...for a month, I coloured the mountain... ...using a whiteboard marker. You're laughing at me! You don't believe? After 30 days I came back,... ...had a mild stroke like this. -Why are you healthy now, Jono? No stroke. -You cursed me. Of course not! I was joking, friend! I wasn't serious. So, when I worked there, sometimes the work was... ...to clean graves. Yes, then..... -Jono, why point here? Well, you're big like a Chinese grave, friend. You're terrible, Jono! -After that, I also... ...guided people who want to climb the mountain. I guided from the front. So they wouldn't get lost. Then, there were times,... ...I would sell Hobgoblin Crackers. Hobgoblin Crackers? -What does it look like? You don't know it's an original Indonesian product? Hobgoblin Crackers are made from selected hobgoblin skin,... ...sterilely processed, roasted at a temperature of 180 degrees... ...and goes through a screening process three times. Just by paying ten thousand rupiah a pack,... ...you can taste the sensual sensation of... ...Endol's savoury taste, that's how it is. The colour is dirty white, friend. Dirty white? -Dirty white, Ali Baba,... ...pomegranate red..... -Gosh! Jono! Jono! Yes, what do you want, my darling? But can you really send... ...us together from the start till we're back again? Gosh, just be calm. If I..... Sorry. If it's me, of course I would accompany you. What's important, I just bring my body, bring my clothes,..... Okay, Jono. It's a deal. -Seriously? It's a deal. -Gosh! You're egoistic. Okay! If so, we'll go to Mount Kawi. All right. -All right. Dika, what's the matter with you? It felt like something pulled me. Did you see anything? -There's nothing. Hey! Hey! Get away from here! Go away! What are you doing here? You guys are dead! Hey! Hey! Go! Go away all of you! All of you are dead! All of you are dead! Dad? Dad? What is it, Dad? -Uncle, what's the matter? In threes, they came in threes. Who? I don't see anyone, Dad. There's nothing, Uncle. -Those three ghosts! Don't just keep quiet like a fool! Get them out! -Hey! Go away! Get out! Go away! They have left. Thank you for helping me. Dad? Were you hallucinating again? You are going to Mount Kawi, right? Yes, I am, Bella. I'm leaving tomorrow. I want to know who made your father become like this. Do you want to come? So, who will take care of my father? Mr. Hendra, our neighbour. We certainly can ask him to help. 'The story of Mount Kawi's black magic to get rich'. Black magic to get rich? -No, just checking. Be careful, Adit. Why? You're too curious about it, perhaps eventually you will... ...do it too. -Of course not. Why are you looking at me like that? No. It just feels like something's wrong about you. Something's wrong about me? What's wrong with me? You're beautiful and that's why I'm confused... ...to find a way to slip into your heart. "Malang Station" Gosh! You guys are in threes. -Yes. I'm told to run like this. -Then you'll be enthusiastic! Jono, goodbye. -Jono, how is it? You're terrible. My underwear is sagging. "Malang Square" Okay, we've arrived. We've arrived at the Square. -Let's take a picture. Jono. -What is it? Isn't this wrong? -Why is it wrong? We're walking in this condition? -No, we're taking a shortcut. You just be calm. It's hot. Ouch, ouch. Hey, guys! I'm tired. Let's rest first. -Let's just rest here, all right? All right then but rest for just a short while, all right? Guys, guys. Miss, may I ask you something? What is it, young man? Do you know the person in the photo? This? This is Mbah Kawi. Mbah Kawi? If I may know, who is Mbah Kawi? He is a guide for those who want the black magic to get rich. Miss, where can I find him? On the west side. Keep going, there's an intersection,... ...then, turn left. Miss, thank you very much. -But, young man. Don't ever play with the black magic to get rich,... ...if you are not willing to bear the risk. Miss, we're not going to that extent. But may I know,... ...what are the bad consequences of it? Your soul... ...will not be in peace... ...until your death,... ...until the Day of Judgment. Miss, thank you. Let's go, hurry up. -Come on, let's go. Do you remember the directions? -Yes, I remember. Can you walk? -Sure. Gosh! I'm tired. -Jono,... ...is it still far? You want me to stand here with my legs apart? No! It means, is it still far away? It's not far. It in front there. -Are you sure? Jono! It means, are you sure? -Gosh! I was on Mount Kawi for a long time. So, no way I'm wrong! All right then. Up to you. -Hey! Wait first! Wait first! But I want to go look for a big tree,... ...I need to pee. -Jono, be careful... ...when you pee here. Don't worry. Anyway, over here... ...it's fine if you just pee but you mustn't take a dump! Rebecca, don't pay attention to people like this. He is indeed possessed by ghosts. Jono, be quick, all right? -Yes, I'm going now. So, what about Jono? Forget it. Wasn't Jono here for a long time? He knows the way. He'll catch up with us. Enough of that, let him be. -Yes, let him be. He'll surely understand, Rebecca. Gosh! It's so troublesome to pee in the jungle. Gosh! Where can I find a big tree? Forget it, I'll just do it here. But I think this tree used to be big. Now it has shrunk. Is it because of the cold? But before peeing, which is the front part of the tree? It's not nice to pee face to face, isn't it? It's embarrassing. But there's nothing? Keep going. I swear, what is it? A ghost? I'm scared. Gosh! It's as if there's a ghost. Gosh! Oh, gosh! Where did those kids go? I've been left behind. Guys, I think that's his house. Gosh! Oh, gosh! What's with you? These little kids are really terrible. How could you have the heart to leave me behind? Sorry, Jono. But you took so long. How could I have been so long? You knew I was peeing, right? Luckily Miss Bella is here. I'm not going to be so angry now. Jono, you keep defending Miss Bella,... ...there must be something going on with Miss Bella, right? Gosh! Hey, TV patrol! Don't be indiscriminate, all right? I want to tell you. There's nothing going on. Didn't we promise that we would to stay together? May peace be upon you. -Is there anyone inside? Mbah. Mbah? -This is very creepy. This house really doesn't feel nice. This is really scary. You just be calm, all right? I'm still here. I will take care of you... ...wholeheartedly, thoroughly. Really? -Yes. Thank you. -You're welcome, Darling. Anyone here? Mbah? I am Mbah Kawi. Your father did come to this place. He was very ambitious... ...to expand his cigarette factory... ...but I could not help him. Meaning,... ...my father didn't go ahead with the black magic to get rich here? Yes, because your father wanted... ...it to be very fast and guaranteed. I will always help people, anyone... ...who comes here to ask for the black arts to get rich... ...in a subtle and humane way. Without the use of any sacrifice... ...even if it is only as tiny... ...as an ant. So, my father did not make any deal... ...with you, Mbah Kawi. -No. That did not happen. If it wasn't with you... ...then with whom, Mbah? -It's possible that he looked... ...for another shaman but still from around here... ...who used several sacrifices... ...and all those spirits are... ...those who were killed by your father... ...to be sacrificed to the point... ...your father became insane and... ...he often "halunisasi". Hallucinated, Mbah. -Yes, that. What was it? Hallucinated. -Hallucinated. That's correct. By the way, Mbah. But Mbah,... ...can you help my father? -Yes, sure. I will help your father to the best of my ability. Mbah, if I may know,... ...what is this? -In that bottle,... ...contains holy water full of spells... ...and later, when you get home,... ...give this water to your father to drink... ...and hang this little kris on the wall. Understand? -Understand, Mbah. Contact me if something happens... ...that you can't handle. Understand? Understand, Mbah. Mbah, thank you very much. By the way, Mbah. How much must I pay for all this? Payment? -Yes. I help sincerely, young man. So, there's no need to pay. There's no need for such things. But if you want to give any amount, I will accept. There is one thing that's more important,... ...when you get home,... ...don't forget to stomp your feet three times. One, two, three, four, five. Mbah, Mbah. What? -That's five, Mbah. That's four. Yes, I know. What it means is not more than three times. Oh, no. -Understand? I got it. Guys, hopefully with this, my father's psyche will... ...be healthy again, right? -Just be calm. Amen. Yes? Amen. -What's important now,... ...our long journey will be smooth. We'll be going back tomorrow, now we'll just relax first. What? We're going back tomorrow? -Yes. Not going back today? -Enough of that. So, what do we do now, Jono? The rest of you? Do we want to stay at the hotel first or what? What? What? What do you mean? You're really crazy. Hey! Look at this! Look at this! I've brought this thing! My hand has carried the weight till my veins are popping. You simply want to stay at a hotel. Set up a tent! All right then. Set it up there. Over there. Go set it up. -Set it up now over there. We want to camp, right? -Yes. Jono, you know how to do it, that's why you're setting it up. Just until the workshop coverage. -Enough of that. Just do it. 'No entry'. Hi. -Hey, Sweetheart. It's cold. -I just want to ask. Where's Jono? What's taking so long? Yes, that's right. I'll try to catch up with Jono, all right? Yes, okay. I'll accompany you, all right? Okay. -Enough of that. Just be calm. You guys wait here, all right? Yes, but don't take too long, all right? Yes, Vieuw. Just be calm. -But aren't you scared? You're not, right? -You be careful. Come here, Sweetheart. -Yes. It's so cold. Gosh! I'm sleepy. Perhaps we should go to sleep. Please wait. -Well, I'm going in now. I'm sleepy too. -Vieuw,... ...we'll continue to be lovey-dovey tomorrow, all right? Bye. -I'm also getting heavier. Please accompany me here first. Aren't you sleeping in the boys' tent? Yes, but they haven't returned yet, Sweetheart. Don't tell me you're not brave even for something like that? All right then. You get some rest, all right? Go to sleep, all right? Yes. -So you'll wake up fresh, okay? Till we meet again tomorrow, all right? Till tomorrow, all right? -Bye. Bye. Sweetheart, get some rest. -Yes. Where is Jono? Jono? Jono? -Jono? Dika. -Yes? It's true, right? Jono is missing. Oh, gosh! What are we going to do? That's not possible, Adit. Hasn't he lived here a long time? Obviously he's quite experienced. What's that, Dika? -I don't know. I think there's someone there. Jono? What? I'm not sure. -Yes, enough of that. Come on, let's go. -Yes, yes. Let's just go. A rubber ball? Jono! Jono! -What's wrong with you? You just barged into me! -Jono, Jono, help me. Jono,..... -What is it? In the tent just now, Jono. A ball came, I gave it back. It came back even bigger, I gave it back again. Then,... ...it came again, I gave it back again, it became a head, Jono! Head of the family? -No! That's my father! A real head, Jono! -Perhaps you saw wrong. All the stump heads are in the tent. It's true, Jono. It was so creepy, Jono. Try look again. -Jono, help me. I'm constantly helping you. Enough of that, see for yourself. Check again? -Yes, go there and check. How can a guy be scared? Jono, it's no longer there. Your head is missing too! That is Vieuw's voice. Perhaps it's because I miss him. Till tomorrow morning, all right? I'm sure there are a lot of ghosts here, Dika. Not possible. Isn't..... Vieuw! Vieuw! -Hey, Vieuw! What is it? Put your tongue in first before you talk. Stump head ghost. It was so creepy, you know? -What? What is it? -I was in the tent,... ...I thought it was Jono, right? When I looked,... ...it was the stump of a head! -You're lying, aren't you? You want to scare the both of us? What's the matter with you? Are you ill? Why do you keep doing this? Is your neck in pain? Your face is ugly, don't make it worse. Vieuw? Vieuw? -Vieuw? The boy is possessed. -Yes, for sure. Perhaps that..... Now why are you keeping quiet as well? Vieuw, hold on, hold on. There is something I want to tell you. You're both crazy, right? Watching too much horror movies. Ghost! Ghost! -Hoy! Vieuw! Vieuw! Vieuw! Vieuw, did you see it? Where's Dika? -Enough of that. He will surely... ...turn up soon. -Nonsense! Shortly we'll see... ...ghosts that are scarier than before! Yes, it's eyes were bulging like a guard keeping a secret, right? There he is. -Hey! Control your breathing if you want to talk! How could not have told me there was a ghost! It's not that I didn't! I was signaling to you,... ...you just didn't see the ghost! -How would I know? You were doing this. -Did the ghost give chase? Who is snoring? There's someone in the tent, right? Don't tell me it's that ghost. Let's check. -I refuse! I don't want to! You don't want to? Let's check first! Come on! Come quickly! Hurry up! How rude. He's just having fun sleeping here. In fact, we were looking for him. Then, we were haunted by ghosts. Instead he's sleeping here! -Yes, let's just wake him up. Hey, hold on! Hold on! -Why? I'm not sure this is the real Jono. What do you mean? -You forgot I met... ...the fake Jono just now? I thought that was Jono. But it was actually a ghost. -Yes, that's right. So, we knock him? -Wait a minute. My father once told me, he said if in Thailand,... ...one can make sure it's a ghost or a person... ...by using a sock. How do you do it? -So, it's like this. If I give him my socks,... ...then, he wrinkles his nose,... ...that means, he's a real human. But if he's just indifferent to it,... ...that means, he's a ghost. Give it go. -All right then. Give it a go. Hey, hurry up. -Yes. Put the socks near him. Enough of that, hurry up. Okay, now we knock him. -Hey! Hey! You still want to knock him. -Yes, you think he's drum. Dika. Dika. Vieuw, Adit,... ...do you guys hear that? Someone is calling my name. Vieuw. I'm being called too. Why aren't you being called? -It's fine, it'll be him shortly. Yes. -Let's listen. One, two, three. Oh, yes! Good luck, all right? Adit. That's bad. -Jackpot. You're a goner. Please come. Adit, Dika, where are we? Yes, how did we get here? Who's that? Vieuw? Dika? -Welcome to my palace. You will all be victims of my sacrifice. Hey, guys. Wasn't she the one who helped us earlier today? Yes, that's right. -She, she, she..... She gave us the directions. -Hold on, hold on. What business do you have with us? Why are we to be made into sacrifice? I certainly have no business with you. But I have business with your father, Drajat! I am his black magic shaman to get rich... ...until he became successful. But now he has broken his promise. He no longer gives me any sacrifices. Okay, okay. Now I understand. All this is definitely my father's fault but... ...why are my friends going to be sacrifices as well? Why? Yes, I will make both of them... ...slaves here and most importantly,... ...they will increase the soul of my beauty! No, no, no. I beg you, please. Please let them go. Let me be the only one who bears... ...all these curses! Please! Please! There's no way we're going... ...to leave you here by yourself. Enough of that, Vieuw, Adit. You guys must get out of here, all right? Please! -Very well, because... ...of your sense of solidarity and... ...your sense of responsibility towards your father,... ...you two, quickly leave! -Adit, Vieuw, enough. No. -You guys must get out of here! Enough! Get out of here! -We will not leave... ...you here by yourself! -Vieuw, listen to me! Quickly leave before I change my mind. Vieuw? -Adit? Vieuw, we were sent back? -Yes. But only the two of us that weren't taken. Dika? Dika? -Dika? Hey, Dika? Hey! You're still here, Dika. -Dika? Wake up, Dika. Dika? He can't, Adit. It seems that his soul was sacrificed by the shaman. Dika? Wake up, Dika! -Dika? Dika? Wake up, Dika. -Dika! Gosh! Gosh! Oh, gosh! You guys are so noisy,... ...disturbing my sleep, I was having a good dream. Never expected... ...Dika would sacrifice his life for his father... ...and us who are only his friends. Yes, Adit. If it wasn't for Dika,... ...we certainly would have been sacrificed too. Dika? Dika? Dika? -Dika? Dika? Dika? Gosh! Why are you guys hugging like that? You look like Teletubbies. Gosh! Why are you guys crying even harder? It's making me sad. I will cry as well. Please wake up, Dika. At exactly 12:00 o'clock,... ...you will be my sacrifice. I've accepted my fate but... ...just now I saw you dancing. You seem to hate and resent something. Yes, indeed I hate... ....the life that I have gone through. I hate everyone who has hurt me... ...and I want everyone to also... ...feel the same pain as I did. Everyone? Including those who are innocent? Yes, I don't care. -Actually,... ...what caused you to feel hatred... ...towards everyone? Way back when,... ...my father was also a sacrifice. My mother died while she was pregnant... ...and I was born a deformed child. Everyone avoided me,... ...everyone hated me! I hate everyone! I hate everyone! -But... ...you look beautiful. You don't look deformed at all. Beautiful? You say I'm beautiful? Yes, my beauty and... ...my beautiful body are... ...the result of my agreement with the Master of Darkness. Did you hear that crow? That is a sign... ...that the time has come for me to hand you over... ...as a sacrifice to the Master of Darkness. Dika, take her magic wand... ...if you want to get out of this place... ...and return to your body. Don't! Don't! Don't! Don't! Don't! Don't..... Dika? -Dika? Dika! Vieuw! Adit! -Dika,... ...how did you get back into your body? It's a long story. Whatever it is, you guys can't... ...tell anyone, okay? We will leave early tomorrow morning. O Allah. I'm back at this house. What's important, you must give that holy water to your father. Yes, it can't be put off any longer. Oh yes, don't forget. Stomp our feet three times... ...before we enter the house. What does it mean? -Well, I also forgot to ask... ...what it meant. -Perhaps it's the healing process. Yes, perhaps. -All right then. Let's do it together. Wait. Let's do it. What's with you? -You said to wait. All right then! We'll count, all right? On three. One, two, three. Okay, give it a go, Vieuw. -Go inside. Me? -Yes. Why me? -Vieuw, hurry up! Well, Vieuw? -How is it? Clear. -Oh, all right. This is obviously a case of being discarded once no longer useful. When their goal was reached, I was pushed aside. Not to mention, it's Kliwon night. Isn't it creepy? There's a woman. I want to seduce her. Miss? Are you alone? She just kept quiet. Perhaps she's still a virgin, right? This is what I meant, Miss. If you're still alone, what if we were... ...went back together? -Sure, Mister. It's fine, Miss. If so, I'll go back on my own. You're a ghost. Ghost! What is this? Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! Uncle! Be patient, Uncle. -Uncle, Uncle. Be patient, Uncle. I've placed the kris in the wall. -Bella, thank you. Dika, are you sure this method will work? Yes, Bella. I'm very sure this method will work. You're all crazy! Let go! Let go! Let go! You're all crazy! -Dad, this holy water... ...will calm you down and not hallucinate anymore. You think you know everything! You want to poison your father... ...so he'll die fast? -Dad, forgive me but I know... ...you studied the black magic to get rich in Mount Kawi. What are you talking about? -Dad, you must drink this. Don't want to! Don't want to! -Dad, drink this. Drink, drink. Drink it. Hot! -Dad? Dad? Hot! -Hot? Hot! -What's wrong with your father? Uncle? Uncle? -Dad? What's the matter with you? Uncle? "Mystical secrets of getting rich quick." This book is just rubbish. It's so hot. What is this? Rebecca! Rebecca, Rebecca, Rebecca! Rebecca! Rebecca, Rebecca, Rebecca. Rebecca, my room is so creepy. What's with you? What is it? -How can stuffed toys be floating? For real? But..... -I'll explain it... ...upstairs, all right? Let's go. -All right then. Let's go. Where? Where is it? -It was there just now. Oh, gosh! There's nothing odd with my stuffed toys. Rebecca refuses to believe it when you tell her. It's true, just now the stuffed toys were floating over my head... ...exactly here. -Yes, I believe it, I believe it. But couldn't that just have been your imagination? For real? -The problem is, I too... ...felt something weird while I was taking a drink just now. I felt as if there was a creature looking at me. But there was nothing when I looked. Are you for real? You're giving me goosebumps. You're scaring me, you know? So, this is what happened. I was sitting here. Them, I took a book. I was feeling bored. Then, I looked back. But the stuffed toys weren't there. Rebecca? Rebecca! Why did you leave me? How could you do that to me? Dad? Dad, you're fine, aren't you? Yes, Uncle. How do you feel, Uncle? I feel well. Hey! Hey! Look at them! There! -What? What did you see, Uncle? -It means,... ...what did you see, Dad? They often bothered me. Now they are gone. Oh, finally. Dika, that means the water from Mbah Kawi is proven effective. Yes, us going to Mount Kawi was not in vain. So, now, case closed. -Case closed! It's so late now, why hasn't he shown up yet? He said he was coming. Is there anyone inside? -Come in! Come in! Dad. -You've returned. My son returned safely but... ...he's still ugly. How sarcastic, Mr. Diman. Aren't your descendants... ...certainly ugly? -You're calling me Mr. Diman? You just talk as you like. You are so sensitive. Hey, Adit. Staying here? -Yes, Uncle. I can't be bothered to go home. It's okay, right? Yes, it's okay but you do have your own home, right? How can you not be bothered to live there. What a pity. Give it to me then. Then I'll make biscuits for you guys, would you like that? Your father is quite pathetic, isn't he? Gosh, enough of that, Adit. Please be a bit understanding. He is a widower. No one wants to be with him. He wants to seduce widows, none of them wants him. He loves to make jokes even if it's pathetic. I'm also just entertaining him, pretending that it's funny. Gosh! Dad, I'll go in now, okay? -Uncle, be patient, all right? What a punk. Who says that no one wants me? No one wants me! -Isn't that pathetic? I will prove it. I will marry three at once. Why is..... It's nothing. I felt there was a hand. What is happening? Why are you screaming? What is this? -That..... That, that, thingy,..... That's the..... What is it? Thingy, that, that, thingy. The thingy is like that. Enough, don't talk back and forth like that. Try telling it slowly, all right? Don't panic. Inhale, exhale. Inhale, exhale. Your mouth smells so bad. What did you eat earlier? Enough of that, tell me what's the matter, Adit? All right then, Uncle. -Yes. So, it was like this, all right? I was washing my face... ...like this. -Yes, like that? Then, there was another hand that was rubbing my face here. Whose hand was it? -Hold on, hold on. You have two hands, right? Yes, of course. -So? Okay, enough! I'm tired. Enough. I'm going now. What's the matter with you? -Nothing. That's it, right? There's nothing. -Yes, there's nothing. Yes, isn't that right? Where do I know this person? Come on, don't be rude. -Sorry, I'm scared now. Hey! If you're scared, you hide. That's called... ...being hungry. -I'm hungry when I'm scared. That's mine. -It's mine. It's mine! -It's mine! It's just for you. No need to fight over it. Oh, obviously you'll be feeling thirsty, right? Here, take this as well, all right? What was that? Satan, a genderuwo or was it a ghost? But I can't be scared. I must be brave. You sleep. You sleep, you're ghost number two. I'm not scared of you, all right? I have knowledge from my grandpa, able to put... ...ghosts into bottles. Bottle into a ghost. Ghosts into bottles. Watch out, don't play around. Yes, this is the bottle. Hey, where did it go? I'm pretty awesome. Uncle Drajat, where are you going? Dad? That's odd, you're being neat and clean. Bella, I want to apologize... ...for troubling you all this time, also my rudeness... ...towards you. Forgive me. -I understand, Uncle. But it looks like you're really well now. All praise be to Allah. Okay,... ...I'm leaving. Take care of yourself, all right? You're leaving? Where are you going, Dad? Dika, thank you for your devotion to me,... ...you too, Bella. You guys have saved me... ...from a troubled mind,... ...frustration, stress... ...hallucinations... ...and being a crazy person. -Dad,... ...I love you. Whatever I did, it's all for you, Dad. Thank you, son. Thank you but... ...I still have to go. You do know that I've allied with Satan... ...in order to practice black magic to get rich. You know, right? Yes, but isn't all that in the past, Dad? Yes, but I've made a promise. I want to get rid of my sins all this while. I want to cleanse my knowledge, cleanse my faith... ...at the Al-Tauhid Islamic Boarding School. Yesterday I spoke to the manager, Kiai Rhoma. He was very happy if I could stay there. But Dad, I beg you. Please don't go. Only with this can I calm... ...my mind and soul. You must know that and you must be strong, all right? Very well, may peace be upon you. May peace be upon you too. May peace be upon you too, Uncle. -Yes. I remind you two. I have a bad feeling. The jinn is not just any jinn. It obviously has a reason for coming here, isn't that right? So, it's not just stopping by. Yes, Dad. No need to think about it, why should you? That's the thing! You must know why. Before you went to Mount Kawi, this house was clean. The minute you returned, a few of such creatures... ...appeared last night. Isn't that dangerous? Your father is right. -Shut up! Don't defend my father. I'm confused. Indah just called, Dad. She said she was terrorized at Rebecca's house. What more when it's like that? The two of you try to think hard... ...what did you guys do over there. Do you know why the demons have followed you here? How is that? Think about it. What did your father say? I don't know what he said. I didn't understand. Isn't that Thai? -Yes, perhaps it's Thai... ...but I think, it's a regional dialect,... ...spoken by villagers. What? Vieuw. Dika, you must be proud of your father, right? He has a chivalrous soul. He wants to cleanse his faith in an Islamic boarding school. Of course, Adit. But it's also hard... ...for me to be separated from my father. Yes, hopefully he will be calmer... ...and his sins will be forgiven by God. Amen to that, Brother. -Be strong, Bro. It means that now we're the only ones who don't feel calm. Not calm? What's the problem? We're obviously being terrorized by jinns, right? What? Jinns? -Yes, last night... ...I was washing my face, then all of a sudden,... ...something was rubbing my brows. -Then, after that,... ...when Adit and I were fighting over food,... ...a jinn joined in and Rebecca as well as Indah... ...were also terrorized at Rebecca's house. Not you? -Not you? Weird. -Oh, no. Maybe it's the effect... ...from the holy water and kris that Mbah Kawi gave. That's why his house hasn't been bothered by ghosts. We'll just sleep at his place now, all right? Can't really do that. My father is sure. Last night he said that these jinns followed us... ...from Mount Kawi but why is that so, is what... ...we must find out the answer. Here! How about I give Mbah Kawi a call? Perhaps he understand and give us some clues. Rebecca, I'll eat first, okay? -All right. I'm a healthy kid, my body is strong. What are you doing here? You ghost! -I'm the ghost! Yes, thank you, Mbah. Rebecca? What are you doing? No, I'm not doing anything. Oh, yes. It seems you and Indah were terrorized by ghosts. Yes, last night. That's how it was. As of now, we must be more vigilant. I just called Mbah Kawi and he said,... ...one of us... ...has tried to learn the black magic to get rich. Black magic to get rich? -No, just checking. Be careful, Adit. Why be careful? You're being too curious, perhaps eventually you will... ...do it too. -Of course not. Dika,... ...I'm actually... ...suspicious about Adit. Why are you suspicious? So, that day, when I was on the train,... ...I saw him reading so seriously... ...about the Mount Kawi's black magic to get rich. After I talked to him, he seemed to be acting weird. Actually, I'm just feeling scared,... ...who knows, he secretly was meditating while he was there. That's impossible. I've known Adit for a long time. When did he meditate? -Well, it could be... ...while we were sleeping, right? But only a few hours isn't enough to meditate. It needs several days. Yes, that's quite right. Yes, but your suspicions are well-founded. Isn't Adit... ...a person who loves to explore. It's best we see him now. Let's go. -All right then. Let's go. Whatever it is, I want permission to go home. Full-stop! Sweetheart, you can't ask for permission just because of that? Then what do I do? I can't concentrate on studying. Do you know that? Because I'm scared. You're not the only one who is scared. We're all looking for the solution, all right? We all also don't want to be bothered by that jinn. All right? Enough of that, Sweetheart. Come here. There they are. Guys, guys. Where's Adit? We must interrogate Adit now. Oh, gosh! What's wrong with him? But just now I saw him over there carrying a camera. Guys! Guys! Guys! -Speak of the Devil. Guys, guys. -Hey! Hey! Hey! What is it? What is it? -That. The jinn followed us to school. I've recorded everything. -Adit, Adit. Hold on. I want to ask you. What have you done at Mount Kawi? Done what? Nothing. -Yes, while on the train... ...I saw you reading so seriously... ...about the Mount Kawi's black magic to get rich. Adit? -You guys are accusing me? Enough of that. You better just be honest. It's fine. I really wanted to know about Mount Kawi. But I was just curious. You guys are accusing me? Adit? Adit? Adit? Dika, you must have proof if you want to talk. Oh, no, no, Sweetheart. Oh, no, no, no, Sweetheart. Adit! What are you still doing there? What are you doing there? -I'm caressing a gorilla's kid. Sweetheart is angry. My sweetheart is angry. Ouch! Why did you bite? -Adit! Adit! When it comes to ghosts, I am the one to blame. Adit! Adit! Wait! Wait first. -What else do you want? You want to accuse me again? Just now wasn't enough? Hey, Adit. Adit, okay. Okay, I'm sorry, all right? Initially, I didn't believe it too. But amongst us, there might be a culprit... ...and this begins with you. -Why me? Vieuw? Indah? Rebecca? Then, you. How am I to trust you, if actually,... ...you're not the culprit? -Well,.... Hold on. It's Mbah Kawi. -Mbah Kawi? Yes, Mbah? Hello? Just admit it. What is this? -Didn't you pick a flower... ....at Mount Kawi? Correct? -What are you talking about? You're talking rubbish. -You know about... ...the black magic from the article on my laptop, right? Enough, it's best you just admit it. We're all calm. Gosh! What is it? I didn't do it! If you admit it, we promise... ...we won't be angry, all right? -Yes. Okay, I admit it! But I just wanted to know... ...the truth about the myth I read. How would I know it would end like this. Hold on, hold on. When did you pluck that flower? So, you threw accusations at me? Adit, I'm so sorry. I was just having fun. Yes, having fun is one thing but... ...perhaps you shouldn't victimize your friend instead. I just started to like you. But now, it just seems like there's no reason to. Adit. -Oh, you guys are here. What are you doing here? -Doing what? Doing what? Guys, it turns out that all this time... ...Rebecca has been doing things. -What? Hey! Guys, again I'm sorry. You two said you wouldn't get angry if I admitted it. Okay, okay, okay. Now where is that flower? Give it to me. I'm suppose to bury that flower tonight... ...in the backyard of my house according to the instructions... ...that I read. -No, no, no. That instruction... ...is wrong because you stole and kept the flower. According to Mbah Kawi's instructions, we must burn it,... ...then, throw it into the river. -No, whatever it is,... ...this is my business. -You can't do that! Rebecca, but we were terrorized. -How can it be just your business? Rebecca, we must burn the flower immediately, all right? If we don't, our business will never end. I don't want to be constantly bothered by ghosts. Rebecca, you really have the heart... ...to see all of us being terrorized by jinns? You don't love us? Yes, yes. All right then. -Okay, okay, okay. When we go home after school, we'll burn the flower,... ...then, we'll throw it into the river, okay? Guys, once again I'm sorry, all right? Yes, it's all right. -It's fine. Enough of that. What's important,... ...you quickly burn the flower. -Yes. Give it to me. Burn it, burn it, burn it. Burn it. Throw it! Throw it! -Toss it! Wow! -Wow! What? -My time. Your time to what? -To shine. Wow! -Wow!
