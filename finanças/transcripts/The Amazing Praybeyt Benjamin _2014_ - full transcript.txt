--== McEphie ==-- I already have jet lag, and we haven't even landed yet. Finally, we're in France. -Let's go. -The plane is too small. It's not small. You're just big. Bonjour! What's "bonjour"? Bonjour, bonjour. Oh, my! Why? What happened? A kid got "in-joured"! Why, you! I'm prepared for this! Hello! I'm Colonel Benjamin Santos! We're from the Philippines. What's your name? I am sorry. I cannot understand French. We are just new here. By the way, I'm Colonel Charles Dickins. We're your welcoming party, Colonel Benjamin Santos. The importance of women is the fundamental love for noodles. I dance the la chamba clumsily on a tiny chair! Hey, Benjie! Was that French? That was Ms. Colombia's answer in the pageant! He speaks English! He's even better than us. What virus is he talking about? How do we know who the enemy is? -What do they look like? -Benjie! Benjie! They're getting up. Run! Hurry up! -Shut the door! -Hurry up. Close the door. Hold it. -Let's split into three groups! -Okay. I'll go with Benjie. What now? Talk to them! -Run, faster! -Hurry. -Hurry. -Run, faster! Faster! Run. Faster. Run! -There, there. Shoot them! -Hurry! -Hurry. Shoot them. -Wait. Shoot them! Shoot them! We need to find a phone so we can ask for help. Let's go there! There they are! Oh, my God! Run! Hurry! I’ll go with you! Just bite me so we can get this over and done with! Go ahead! Why not? Cholesterol your face! Benjie! -They're here! -Hey, hey, hey! -Get rid of these! Let us through. -Help us. Find another way. This is hard to get through! If I get bitten, I'm eating you first! That’s right. -Help us, quick! -Hurry. Hey! I don't know what to do! -What should I do? -What now? Who would have thought we'd be fighting zombies? If your enemies aren't human, use the seeds I placed inside your bag. -So, what now? -It's a start. Come here! What? Hurry. Hold this. -What's that? -What's this? Seeds. Seeds? There. Hurry. Let's plant these! Hurry. They have to grow fast. Hurry, they're here. Plant the seeds. Come on! Come on! Go. Plant those seeds. Here they come! Oh, there. Done. Okay, come here. Hello. -My husband and my son. -Yes. -Thank you. Thank you. -Benjie! Benjie! Way to go, Benjie! Hi, Benjie! Any message for the country? Benjie! Sir Benjie! Mom! Mom! I've missed you! I've really missed you. -Bro! -I've missed these kids! -I've missed these kids so much! -Bro. Son! Excuse me! -Grandma! I've missed you. -I've missed you. -I've missed you! -I've missed you. Son, why did you push him? Relatives first. Family first, right? He's your father. Trust me. Come on. You're too old to have an affair! It's not like that. This is your father. Go explain to your son. I'm an inventor, aren't I? I invented a potion that can change one's appearance, then I took it. So, you took a potion to look good? Your mom sure enjoyed it. -For real? -Yes, it's true. So good-looking, Dad! I've missed you. I haven't seen you in a long time. So handsome. Why not give me a potion to make me pretty? You're handsome already. Oh, please, Dad. Where's Grandpa? Grandpa really is the best. That's my husband. Nice! -Good moves! -Son, is it true? The ones that defeated the zombies in France were the seeds I invented that turned into plants? No, Dad. I'm the one who defeated them, not your invention. If it weren't for me, they wouldn't have been defeated. He's really good, right? -Let's go there. -Okay, sis. You were so good, Dad. Grandson! Sorry, that's all I could manage. Shimmy spin top dancing. You were so cute there. Maybe I got those moves from you. You know, Grandson... I will never get tired of saying we're proud of you. Think about it. Something impossible that you made possible. It runs in our genes. You know, the president called me. Do you know what he said? No. You must go to the presidential palace tomorrow evening. He has something to say. Okay, I'll try. I'll squeeze it into my schedule. Is someone looking for Santos? We're locating him, sir. General, has Colonel Benjamin Santos arrived yet? We called him already. He had to stop by someplace. Excuse me. But please follow up with him. -I have an appointment later. -Yes, Mr. President. He's taking too long. Where is Benjie? The president's been waiting. We're also waiting for him. This is embarrassing. Don't worry. We're locating him. -Hurry. -Hurry up. Yes, I'll talk to Benjie. -Please, Lucrecia, hurry! -Okay. Mom, Dad, I spoke with Lucrecia. She's with Benjie at the Birdy Birdy Bar. He has no plans of coming here. At a bar in broad daylight? Benjie, do you know what time it is? Why don't you buy a watch? You can afford that dress, but not a watch? They've been texting and calling. You're making the president wait! We have to go! Sir, we've tracked down Santos. He's at Birdy Birdy Bar. Seems like he'll be ignoring this event. Santos! I'm taking you. To your palace? To the presidential palace! I'm taking you to the president now! What is this? Ouch! Don't push me! Benjie! You're all early as if you're being awarded. Hi, Grandpa! Hi. Nice to meet you, sir! Gross. Oh, is that mine, too? I wasn't told this would be like a gay beauty pageant. There. Thank you very much for coming. I expected this award. Considering how amazing I am. Mr. President, thanks for having this laminated. I absolutely expected it. But what I didn't expect is... all of you. I don't know you. I know every one of you wants to have a picture with me. I'm giving everybody a chance to take pictures later, okay? Colonel Benjamin Santos. No biggie! Grandson. Didn't I tell you about this? What took you so long? It's embarrassing to the president. You're so late. Grandpa, chill. -Come on. -Come, let's take pictures. -Hurry. -We'll join, too. Wait. I'll have a solo shot first. -Do you have this? -No. -How about this? -No. -Step back. -No. Me first. Get a picture with me later. What's with Benjie? He's so arrogant. He has changed. There. Just take a picture. He'll be your new officer. That's not necessary, sir. You're angry again. You will be forming a new anti-terrorism unit. We're under threat from a new group. The United Terrorist Organization United Terrorist Organization. UTO-UTO? We have to act quickly. I know how to deal with them. I've just been there. My style is so fresh. Are you insulting me? What's with your temper? You're always hotheaded. Get an air conditioner for your head. What time are they coming? Bautista is here. Set them aside first. Where are the pictures -I asked you to find? -Here. Terrorists' pictures! Here they are. These are the faces you need to remember. Why do you have celebrity pictures? Santos's collection, sir. He gave them to me. I thought it was what you needed, sir. Wait, where is Santos? Still outside, sir. Giving an interview. He was late as well. I didn't allow that interview! Colonel Santos, is the Philippines ready for threats of terrorism? The entire armed forces is very prepared... for an attack by those terrorists. And I trained these soldiers to fight the UTO-UTO terrorists. They're all prepared. How about you? Are you ready to admit you're an alien? Any other questions? No more. Can we get a groupie instead? Fine. Where's our monopod? -Group picture! Game! -Oh, here. There. Santos! What's this commotion? Grumpy as usual. You didn't want an interview inside. I had it outside, and you're still objecting? Sir! You've got to see this. He said we have to watch it! -Let's watch it. -Got a problem? Step aside! We are the UTO-UTO! But we're not fooling you. Because we'll be invading the Philippines! But it doesn't have to be that way. Because we can stop all this if you give us Boracay... Baguio, Palawan, and Batanes. If you don't hand them over... we'll have no choice but to detonate the bombs we planted here! In the Philippines! We have three bombs... which we alone have knowledge of when... and where they will explode. So, if I were you... give us what we're asking. Or else... goodbye! We'll attack! Let's go. Let's get ready. We're going with them! You're staying! You don't know Janjaranjan. You're Facebook friends? No. I'm following him on Instagram. Why? -Are you kidding me? -Are you complaining? I love it when you make fun of me. -He's got attitude. -Chief's short-tempered. Are you okay being left behind? Yes. That Chua is just trying to be a hero. Will you allow him to take the lead role? Yes. We should have made this The Amazing Private Chua, then! I'm the star, okay! We'll just sit here? Yeah. Let's all just kid around. ARMY SERVICE 16IB 4 Santos! What are you doing here? Sir, we want to help. We brought gadgets! See? -Hurry. -Move! Move! Hurry! Go there. There. Put it down. -He's all yours! -Okay. Bye! What now? Drop your gun. What will we do? What's the plan, Benjie? Are you sure? Let's go. I'll handle him. -There. -Let's go. Let's go. You're handsome. But I will still beat you. Trying to scare me? Nothing? Nothing? -Let's go. -Let's go. You're so gorgeous! -You want a kick fight? -Okay. Sure! Are you sure? Jhong Hilario. Jhong Hilarious! Okay, okay, okay. We're here where an encounter is taking place between the military and the terrorists. Right now, the soldiers are having a hard time -finding Janjaranjan. -Where's Benjie? Dad, you startled us. Considering how stubborn your grandson is, I'm sure he's there. He's not safe there. Janjaranjan is dangerous. Hang on. I am tired. I'm tired, girl! Me too! Can't we just be friends? I'll follow you on Twitter and Instagram. -Bro! -Because... -Hey. -All our comrades are dead. Hey. San-- Santos, we're friends, right? Yes. Take it. A token? Like for trains? Take care. Take care, okay? It's a bomb! What are you laughing at? There's a ticking bomb! You're all going to explode! -Where's the bomb? -Inside! Everyone's gonna blow up! What are you doing, Benjie? That'll explode! What are you doing here, Grandpa? I followed you. Because you're so stubborn! Please don't scold me. I need to defuse this bomb! You can't stop it. That's a different kind of bomb! Come, we'll escape. -You go ahead, Grandpa. -Let's go! -Grandpa. -It will explode! I won't leave you here. We'll do it together. Grandpa. Make yourself lighter. It can't carry us both. You haven't peed in days! That's why you're bladder is full. -Go, save yourself. -Grandpa. What are you thinking? I love you. Grandpa? Grandpa. Grandpa. Grandpa! Grandpa! Grandpa! Grandpa! I love you, Grandson. Grandpa! Grandpa! Grandpa! Son? Let's put Grandpa on the altar. My grandpa. My grandpa. My grandpa. My grandpa! My grandpa! Grandpa! My grandpa! My grandpa! He's so arrogant. He thinks he's the best. If he hadn't been cocky, his grandpa would still be alive! So conceited. And hardheaded, too. Such a bad guy! -Right? -He's coming. Are you really here to pay your respects? And it seems you love my grandpa. How disgusting! I'm leaving! You don't know what happened. I'm not a bad person to let Grandpa die. I love him. Let's get some coffee. Grandpa. Sir, are you okay? Go bury yourself! So ugly! Colonel Santos. Colonel Santos. Colonel Santos. You disobeyed your commanding officer -and let Janjaranjan escape. -But, sir... We hereby bestow disciplinary action. General Chua. Santos. You will do everything General Chua will order you. Understood? Santos! They're punishing me like I haven't contributed anything to this country. Next time, don't be a know-it-all. If you don't want to be dismissed completely. From now on, you will do as I say. You need permission for every move you make. Even breathing. Wilson! It's me! It's Krissy! -Why did you disappear? -But of course! All you cared about was your work for the country! -Krissy... -We are in danger! We're being chased by the terrorists! -Why? -I ran from them! After I made and planted the three bombs in the Philippines. You mean Janjaranjan's bombs came from you? He forced me! He said if I didn't make bombs, he would kill our son! Okay, so here's what I'm going to do. Bimbee knows where the bombs are. I'll send him to my good friend Darla who lives on Zumba Street. Pick him up there! Where's Bimbee? Where are the bombs? Wilson, they're coming! Krissy! Santos! What's happening to you? You told me to hold my breath! I didn't tell you to kill yourself. He didn't even apologize. Bro, soldiers! Let's escape! Hurry! -Hurry! -They're coming! -Yes, quick! -Hurry! Hurry! Krissy! Where's Krissy? -Krissy! -Is that Krissy? -That's Krissy? -That's not Krissy. Maybe that's Krissy. Maybe she drowned and got bloated. Cut it out! That's not Krissy. It's Darla. Darla. Where's my son? Maybe she ate Bimbee and got that big. Where's Bimbee? Tell us where. You're about to die! -She didn't get to say where. -She did! -Where? -There! Lift it! There! Bimbee? They all look alike. Who's your son? Who among you is Bimbee? They are ignoring us! Do you have a picture of the mother? Do you have a picture? Let me see. Oh, that's Krissy? I know how we can identify Krissy's son. How? That one is Krissy's son! That's him. Yes. Look. That's her son. Told you so. Mabuhay! All the food I've cooked for you just got spoiled. You got home just now. It's annoying-- Who is the kid? Daddy, who is he? He is Bimbee. Your brother. What? Take it back! That's not true! Since when? Who is she? Is she prettier? Younger? Who is she? Answer me! Gundina! Just to remind you. You're only a maid. Not my wife! Oh, okay, I'm the nanny. Yes! I'm the nanny! Hi, I'm the nanny. What mission are you assigning me? Santos. Wait, sir! Send me to war anywhere, but not this kind of mission. This mission is special. You need to gain my son's trust. Because he's the only one who knows the location of the bombs. No, sir. I really can't accept this. I'll go ahead after eating. Sir, sorry I'm late. I need you to do something. But why are you sweaty? My car broke down, so I ran. Take your clothes off before you get sick. There. Santos! I thought you were leaving? The main course just came. Sir, when do I start? Where is my room? No allowance is fine. I can manage. Is he included? There they are. You already killed her, right? Yes, Boss. You sure? Yes, Boss. So, naturally, you've also killed Krissy's son? Uh, yes, Boss. Join the party! Go work out, too! -Sir. -Good afternoon, sir. Call them. You'll have a day off, but you need my permission. They will be your housemates. Captain Donna Tenille. We've met. I know you well. You gave me a hard time in part 1, right? Serves you right. You're off the service. I'm Zak Apron. Zak Apron? Really? Do we have a problem with my name? Yes. It doesn't suit you. Tom Tummy suits you better. I'm so ashamed. Apologize, then. I'm sorry. My daughter with another woman. Her mother died, so I took her in. Being your girlfriend is scary! Every woman you date dies! I'm more than ready to die for my beloved! -You're still alive? -Why? Do I look dead? You just look like a corpse. I'm Gundina Galamiton, head maid of this house. Head maid. Next time you hire a maid, find one who has a little meat. If I cook her, she'll be spareribs! Where's my son anyway? Sir, he's in his room. He won't come out and talk to us. But we've fed him. Benjie, Benjie, Benjie. -I have three words for you. -What's that? One big good luck! But that's four! That's only three. Because "good luck" is one word. But you hesitated. Bimbee! Bimbee! -Bimbee. -Bimbee. Bimbee. Bimbee. Bimbee, Jollibee. Oh, Bigboy. Bigboy, Bimbee. I want to play. -What? Chinese? -You speak Chinese? -I want to eat! -Don't want! Shoo! Leave! He doesn't like you. "Don't want, shoo!" "Chi" means "to eat." Chi? Food? Like Kim Chiu? Kim Chiu doesn't eat. See how thin she is? Tell me. Where's the bomb? It's in your food. Spit it out! Spit it out! -No, no! -Spit it out. Hurry. Spit out the bomb. Spit it-- Don't you dare fool me! We're not close. You know Stop Dance? Boom! Panes! Boom, boom! Panes! Panes! Boom! Panes! Boom, boom! Panes! Boom! What bomb spoils easily? Bomb panes! That's old school. Bimbee, this one. What bomb is a fierce animal? There you go, the newest joke ever! Can't you just ask the boy where the bomb is? Bam? Bam Aquino? -Bom. -Bom? Bom Navarro? Diego. What are you doing there, Santos? Just checking if my keypad is still complete. No biggie. Did you get anything from Bimbee yet? Nothing yet, sir. We're running out of time. We need to get the information from him. No time, but you still go to the gym? -What did you say? -Nothing, sir. -I heard you say something. -If you heard it, why did you ask? What are you doing there? Running. How can you run if it's not plugged in? It's a waste of electricity. Same thing. I'll run anyway. There it is, getting faster! That kid is so hard to get along with! I've done everything to gain his trust. But I still don't have information about the bomb. What's more, an intelligence report from the military says the bomb is about to go off! -That's why I'm going crazy. -Oh, well. It's a good thing you're visiting your parents. Your dad's an inventor, right? Maybe you'll get something to help you! -I hope so. -All right. Bye. Mom? Dad? -My wife is so beautiful. -Hey! -Who are you? Thieves! -Hey. Wait. Calm down, son. What are you doing in our house? Son, I'm your Daddy Ben. She's your Mommy Beth. Your father keeps involving me in his experiments. That's why I'm like this. This suits me well, right? I look like my idol Angel Locsin! So, I joined in! Since she's Angel Locsin, I became Luis Manzano. This is just temporary, so it's fine. So beautiful. Don't fool me. You're both scammers! If you're really my dad and she's my mom, then kiss! -Okay, then. -Son... See? And if you're really my dad, kiss me! Son, you're adopted. No, Dad. You used to kiss me all the time. Just one! I found you outside the house when you were a baby. Dad, stop it. Hurry up and kiss me! Your scene is short. What's happening? There! The effects wear off too soon. I'm not Angel Locsin anymore. That's amazing, Dad! Give me some of that! -Here, take it. -Dad. What should I do if I want to look like someone else? Drink it. For real? Darla. Bimbs? Because, you know, your mom has a lot on her mind, so she forgot. So you won't be sad and lonely anymore. Bimbee, wanna eat? Hey! Who are you? I mean... That's an old ploy! You want to kidnap the kid! -No! -Help! In here! Why? Why? Who are you trying to fool? It hurts. It's hurts. Why did you transform? Benjie? Why did you hit me? Sorry, Benjie. My brother and I sued the last person who beat me! How can I dance Zumba like this? The first bomb planted by the UTO-UTO terrorists has detonated. The explosion happened near the Port Area. There were no injuries or casualties in the incident. The first bomb already exploded! No? Many are in danger because of what you're doing. What do you mean "I don't care"? You don't care that many people died? What's "care"? What? I'm already having a hard time with you. Dealing with you isn't worth the pay I'm getting! What's "worth"? If you were an egg, I would've cracked you a long time ago. Oh, please! What do I have to do for you to tell me your secret? I need to know where the bombs are! Bimbee... Bim... Bim... Bimbee! Bimbee! Bimbee! Bimbee! Bimbee. We don't eat with Benjie anymore. Even when we go out. Or go to church. What can we do? We have a very busy brother like Benjie. He wants to do so much in life. Hopefully... wherever he is... he'd know how much we love him. But, Mom... even if he's not here... life goes on, right? Exactly. I hope he and Grandpa are together. I hope they're both in heaven. Even if they say gays aren't allowed in heaven. Hey! Why is he already dead? We just miss him. Why did you bury him? Sorry, Mom. I got carried away. Let's eat now. Bimbee! I don't know how your mom raised you! But since you're with me now, you will do as I say. You'll sue me? I'm your father! Hold on. You're hurting him. I've not hurt him, don't overreact. Pick someone your own size! So what'll you do now with your hard-headed son? Pressure cook him? Don't meddle with my way of disciplining. You, too. You lack discipline! Why am I the issue now? The problem is, you're selfish! Hey! Look at me! I'm talking, right? You said "look who's talking." I'm still talking. How rude! Hey, don't "hey" him. I'm the one defending you, yet you argue with me? -Because you're wrong. -No, you're wrong! You even argue with your dad because you're hard-headed! -Your skull is so thick! -Don't talk to him that way! He's my son! He's not just your son, he's also my son! That's why you don't respect me! -Sharon? -Aylabuyo. Good thing the bomb blew up! Boom! Panes. Sir, is that alcohol? Leave. I want to be alone! Just a moment, sir. Allow me to do a monologue. I'd like to apologize to you, sir, because... -I know I'm meddling too much-- -At least, you know! This is a monologue, okay? Cut in later. I'm sorry, sir. Now, I understand why your son is like that. Sir, do you know how I became strong? And why I have a solid personality? Because my dad completely accepted and supported me. Even if I'm gay. Bimbee is gay? Are you just drunk or are you also high? That's not what I meant. What I mean is that all his insecurities will disappear if you let him feel how much you love and care for him. Especially now his mom's gone. That's all, sir. See you. -Santos! -Sir? Drink with me. I thought you wanted to be alone? And I don't drink pool water. Come here! This is alcohol. Sir, I don't drink that! -Come on! -Sir, please let go of me. Our manager said we could only entertain. No drinking. If you're planning to do something bad to me, What are you drinking, sir? Wait, I'll take my shoes off so I can join you. Such a waste to drink alone. Oh, this makes you wet. Drink this. Wait. I have a glass. Let me. It's strong. I'm sorry too. For offending you. I hope that my being good soldier... can make me a good father too. But you know what... your son loves you. That's great. I love my children too. I just don't know how to show them. Sir. Santos! Are you going to kiss me? Sir! Don't be so full of yourself! You were drowning, so I was going for mouth-to-mouth. But you woke up so I didn't push through. Let's just swim, Sir. Hurry! The water's fine. Since your feet have been soaked for so long. Ouch! What are you doing there anyway? What nothing? You miss your mom, right? Is that all? You're just gonna bug me about the bombs? I won't nag about the bombs. Slowly. Hold it! What's that? What are you two doing? Nothing, ma'am. Don't overact. What are you planning to do... to Bimbee? Nothing, Ma'am. We were just playing up and down. I'm "it." I don't care. Tell me. You're lying. I'm going to tell you but don't freak out. I'm taking Bimbee to the mall. Why is there a mole on your tooth? Oh, this? It's not mole. It's tooth decay! You're just envious. Just let us go. The kid is pitiful. He's bored since you don't let him out. You're too strict. Don't take away his right to enjoy his life! I have a better idea. -What is it? -I'll go with you. But I will change my outfit. -Hurry up. -I'll be quick. Okay, let's go. Go and change. I'm done. -Let's go. -Right. Let's go! Come on down! Here we are. What took you so long? I don't know with Benjie and his gimmicks. There he is. Why are you like that? You're so overacting. This is how I shop so they'll be scared and won't charge me too much. Remember... you're responsible for taking that little boy outside. You took him out even if it's dangerous for him. Don't talk to me that way if you don't want to be locked up! I know what I'm doing. And I'll make sure they won't recognize the little boy they're after. Hi. -Sarah? -Right. Miss Minchin? No, Mommy Divine. -Let's go, Sarah! -There. Move! You're both crazy! We're in a mall, yet you dress up like that! -My goodness! -Food tasting! -So annoying! -What's that? Free sample, Sir. Try it. To shut you up, and make you relate with us. There! Sarah. Minchin. Lottie. -Let's go! -Beautiful. Perfect. Come along, sir. -Why are you taking him? -To complete the cast. Sarah. Minchin. Lottie. And Ermin-guard. -Let's go! -Let's go. I have to know first if it's poisoned. Look at the guy. Okay? -What? -Taste. Now we know there's no poison, okay? Hold it! In fairness, this is fast. And the safety features are nice. Bimbee simply wants to have fun. He just wants to play outside. That's why I took him out even if his father disapproves. Seems you've already gained his trust. You know what? You can now easily ask where the other bombs are. That's my problem. I promised not to ask him about the bombs. Benjie, what about your mission? I'll figure out something. Are you eavesdropping? -I'm sorry. -Gossip girl! -Yes! Yes! -Yes! One more! I don't care if you're the President's nephew. Bimbee, watch me. Like that! Okay? -Bimbee! -Bimbee! -Bimbee! Bimbee! -Bimbee! Bimbee! -Bimbee! -Bimbee! What have I done? We were supposed to have fun. It's crazy. Santos! What, Sir? I'm having coffee. Look at what you did. I didn't put that freaky mask on the kid. This doctor did that. Don't blame me. I've nothing to do with that. Wait. The kid is resting. We shouldn't be too loud. If his breathing is not yet normal... I suggest hospital confinement. Okay, Doctor. Thank you very much. None of you knew he had asthma? I didn't know, Doc. He didn't grow up with me. That child is a son of a lady terrorist that this guy hooked up with but didn't know was a villain. She got pregnant, gave birth, and left the boy to him. -There. -But he neglected his son even here. He doesn't make time for the boy. Was I asking you? You're angry all the time... We were just giving the doctor some useful information. Maybe it's not asthma but something else. Maybe he's looking for care and attention from his father. It's asthma! Caused by sniffing tons of hair dust with the costume you made him wear. Had you not been so brazen to take out my son, which I strictly forbid, none of this would happen. Got it? No, you're talking too fast! Where's my gun? It's asthma! Caused by thousands of hair strands from the costume you made him wear. Had you not been so brazen to take out my son which I strictly forbid, none of this would happen. Cool, huh? I memorized it. I understood. You just have a foul temper. A gun, really? We're anti-violence here. I don't need you. Nobody needs you in the service. So know your place. Don't turn your back on us! We haven't paid the doctor, it's a shame. We bothered her. Even just a downpayment? Benjie. I disobeyed your father. I put you in danger. Good thing you're okay now. Because if you're not, I can't forgive myself. You'll give this to me, Bimbee? -Bimbee! -Joke! At last, he's blurted it out! Now ask him where the bomb is. He's already in the mood. Ask him where the other bombs are. Quick! Why are you rushing? If he tells all, this movie will end. We're just starting. You're so rude. Bimbee? Why won't you tell anyone what you know? Do you know you can save lives if you reveal that secret? save the entire Philippines from the bad people. Your father can defeat bad people with this. Bimb-- Go away for now. -Go, cook something. -I'm chilling here. You're always intruding! Olive Oyl is always gossiping. Nosy idiot. Brutus! -Go cook! -Whatever! Fathers have different ways of showing love for their child. Go on. We know you well. Speak up. What is it? I have come to love Bimbee. Not like that. You foulmouths! I meant that we have grown fond of each other. I don't know what to do anymore. I'm not sure if I'll tell General Chua Bimbee's secret. If I do, Bimbee will be mad at me. But if I don't, I'll be dismissed. Then I'll be a total failure. Isn't informing General Chua the right thing to do? It's mission accomplished already. I'll be the one to destroy the bombs. I'll just tell General Chua once I've succeeded. That way... I have fulfilled my promise to Bimbee and fulfilled my duty to the country. I'll be hero again! Okay, I'll leave. Don't forget the anniversary, okay? Where are you off to? I'll buy a Christmas tree. As a partner for Snowman. Besides, the manger scene's almost complete. Bring some sheep, too! But I'm the horse already. -Hey. -Son, happy anniversary! -Bro. -Happy anniversary. -Come. Let's go inside. -Let's go. Let's go. -I'm starving. -Sure, you're going to eat. But we should wait for Benjamin so we can all eat together. Oh, dear me. Perfect timing! I'm so hungry! -Yes, you're right. -But we have to wait for Benjie. -Right. -Told you so. -Let's wait for him. -Yes. Move! You're too slow! The bomber is really brilliant. Near a school! Many will die! Look at yourself. Are you eating the soil? The ground's too hard to dig up! You're competing with Big Boy. Cut it out. Take it easy. We'll explode if the bomb's hit! I'm scared. You coward. You shouldn't have come. Benjie, Jessamin has been texting. -The anniversary-- -I know that! I know! Why don't you do your job? -I was just concerned. -For my family? No. Of the food. It might spoil. You glutton! -It's really delicious! -That's it. -Hang on! -Why? We have to wait for Benjie first, Mama, which is why we're taking these. Jessamin, take these. Don't worry, we'll label them with your names. -Yes, Mom. Okay. -Sure? Okay, give me that. -Let's go. Drink up first. -My God. There's too much of it... What's that? Do you hear that? -What? -It's 5:30 already! -What? -It's Ang TV time! -It's already Ang TV. Let's go. -Hey. That's 4:30! -4:30! -What? -4:30! -You always get in the way. You can't get along. -Where's that? -It's like it's in here. -It's right here. -Here? -There! -Here, here. -Come on, dig. -Dig more. -Do it slowly. -Dig. -There! I'm hitting something! -There. -Where? -There, I hit something! Yes, you are hitting something! Me. I told you I hit something. Good job! This is it! -That's it! That's it! -There it is! Careful! Careful! It's gonna blow! Bomb! Cut it out, Benjie! Hold it! -It's gonna blow! -Me? Number four? Benjie, what are we going to do? -Yes, right. What? -I got this. It's just a bomb. Hand me a nipper. Hurry. -Oh no. -Sis. -Benjie's not here yet. -But we're very hungry! -Don't worry, Mom. -Right. He sent a message. He's on his way. -Really? -Yes. -Just this one. -We're so sorry. Mom, let's wait for Benjie. Someone just gave that to us. Give that to us later, okay? Oh gosh. -It'll spoil. -I'll wash it myself. -Don't-- -We need to ask for help, Benjie! -Hang on! -What? Hey. Hey. Faster! -Benjie! -I can do this. Benjie. Benjie, hurry. -Hello, sir? -We'll explode. Yes, we found the second bomb. We're here at a forested area, at the back of St. Agnes University. Once he arrives, we'll eat. Take a seat and talk. -I can handle this. -Benjie, what are we gonna do? How to do this? Wait. Santos! It might explode! Sir, I know this. -All right, Bautista! Defuse it! -Yes, sir. Calpito, tools. Last two minutes, already! Last two minutes, already? Just happy! No ending! -Quit fooling around! -He hit him. This is serious! -Why did you hit me? -Would you rather I shoot you? It's up to you, Sir. Maybe... Sir, it's okay now. It's defused. Very good! Take it to Command Center! -That's how easy it was? -Yeah, right. -Hey, let's go there too! -Let's go! What do you mean? Why? Dismiss right away? Not even recess? You should thank me for discovering the bomb here! Did I ask him to come here? -Coming here was his choice. -Right. I didn't even text him yet he showed up. Nobody told him to. Now he says he doesn't want to see me? I know. What's with him? We just starved here, Mom! Let's go. My small intestines ate my large intestines. The food was already in our hands. -My God! -So selfish! Let's just eat at a restaurant. -How irritating! -I'm so hungry! I'm sure Benjie has already eaten. All set. I'm leaving. Are you happy? I'll be happier... if I get this. How dare you pack this. It's mine! It's mine! Go on. That's mine! Hey! That's mine! Can't you see it's pink! It's mine! -Don't-- -It's mine! Don't steal on your way out! -This is mine. -Mine. Don't fight or your arm will have snapped off! I don't care, this is mine! Didn't you know I've marked this? To prove it belongs to me. There! See it? That's you? -Gonzaga? -Yes. Look, it's Toni! "Toni Gonzaga." That's your sister's! Not yours! I stole this from her. -Did she give that to you? -The nerve! Don't meddle here. Bimbee! Bimbee... Sir? -Maybe there's a second chance. -Leave! Got it. I'm going. Open the door, please. It's Sir Benjamin! -Can we have a picture? -Not now. Just one picture, sir. Oh, son, you're early. Too early for next year. You could have told me, Mom! Is the celebration next year? I shouldn't have rushed. That's the problem with you! You joke all the time. You think you can get away with everything with that style? You're so out of our league. We don't know you anymore. Mom, please not now. I'm so stressed out. I was dismissed from service. I'm not a soldier anymore. That's what your dad and I are so afraid to happen. When all the pride and glory... go to your head. You've become too proud. Please forgive me. I have nothing to be proud of now. All I've worked hard for. Everything. Even the self-esteem I have. All of it are already gone. And it hurts because... I feel so alone. That's not true, Son. You've forgotten we're here. Your family. Always by your side. There's no problem if you want to be the best. However... you shouldn't forget where you started. You're all this. So you forgot to use this. What's in here? -Nipple. -Nipple-- -Son. -Sorry, Dad. I'm kidding. I know it's the heart. Love. That's always been your primary weapon before you became a great soldier. Please forgive me, Mom and Dad. I'm sorry, Dad. I'm sorry I've failed you all. Acheng, cheng, cheng, cheng Acheng, cheng, cheng, cheng, cheng Acheng, cheng, cheng, cheng Acheng, cheng, cheng, cheng Acheng, cheng, cheng, cheng Acheng, cheng, cheng -Crazy! -Cheng, cheng Acheng, cheng, cheng, cheng -I miss this! -Acheng, cheng Acheng, cheng, cheng, cheng Acheng, cheng, cheng, cheng Acheng, cheng, cheng, cheng Acheng, cheng, cheng, cheng Acheng, cheng, cheng, cheng Acheng, cheng, cheng, cheng Acheng, cheng, cheng, cheng Dad. -Mom, I love you. Sorry. -Son. Idiots! You're useless. My instructions were simple! You told me you already killed Krissy's son! How come the second bomb didn't explode? There's nothing worse than the way you treat your children! You know what, sir? Yes! My job is to feed your kids and put food on the table. But you? Your job doesn't end there, sir. You devote all of your time to the country! But you don't leave even a little for your kids! That's wrong! Wrong! Because your kids need you! You, Wilson! Only you, Wilson! Here... here... I love your children so much. I did everything... for all of you. But, Wilson... enough! This has to stop! No more! I don't want it anymore! Enough, indeed! Here. Your last pay. Leave! Sir, that was... a role. From Be Careful. I imitated Maya, sir... I'm dead. General Chua is Bimbee's father? We'll attack their house. Hurry up. Let's go! That's the kid! That's Krissy's son! -Run! -Come here!. Get off of my brother! Let me go! It's not yet New Year-- -My children! -What? Your children? -Get her, too! -Get off of me! Ouch! Get off of me! Here's the General. -You should be calm. -He's here. Be calm, okay? Don't-- I'll explain. All right. Just stay calm. -Sir... - Sir! Janjaranjan's group came! -They kidnapped Bimbee and Misty. -They went inside... -Sir, all the guards are dead. -They kidnapped Bimbee and Misty. One at a time! What really happened? Janjaranjan's group attacked our house. They're too many and had guns. The bomb... Sir, only Benjie knows where the third bomb is. -Your son is likely to be there. -Sir. Sir, it's Janjaranjan! -Listen to us, please! -Bimbee and Misty... -Make sure they're safe. -What if Janjaranjan's men came back? They won't! Sir, this is Santos' house. Janjaranjan came to the house. He took Bimbee, Misty, and Gundina. They might be where the bomb is. The children were kidnapped? Probably. They're not going to the mall. Right! At the mall! The bomb is at the mall. That's where they should be! At Mall of Asia? At the Great Mall of China! -Where's that? -In Binondo. So let's go! I'm coming along! I'll only come on one condition. What's that? Kiss me on the lips! A yummy kiss! Save it for the ending. Come on! -Son! Son! You should wear this! -Mom. -Can't I pull this off? -It's ready. Mom, it's such a waste to cover it up. -There. Here's more. -What's that? You actually prioritized the gloves instead of pants? -Let's go. -Oh, you're right. Find where the bomb is! Excuse me. Can't we first wait for my dad? Can you not interrupt my litany? I'll blow your head off, you like it? Go there. We have to find my children and the bomb. It must not detonate here. Its virus is air-borne. Sir, how do we get people to leave? -They're so many. -That's easy. Leave it to me. What's up, people? -Do you love your lives? -Yes. A bomb's about to explode! Told you, sir. Easy as pie. See them running... Sir? Sir! Bimbee! Why don't you just tell him so he can let us go? You're so hard-headed! Really? Is he telling the truth? -No. -You'll kill-- The boy says you'll still kill us! Is that true? -Even if we tell you where the bomb is? -No. Really? How dare you! After all that we've been through! You're just going to kill me? Don't you feel sorry for me? It's me! Have you forgotten our relationship? Help! Help! -Do you hear that? -Help! -Of course. -Help! -We have ears, too. -Help! -That's Gundina. -Help! You thick faced! After everything! You liars, you didn't really hear it. -It's from there! -Let's go there. I hate you! -Help! Help! -Hey. -How dare you! -Daddy! Daddy! -Get over here. -Daddy! Daddy! -Drop your weapons. -Daddy! Drop your weapons or we'll shoot these kids! -You first! -Put the gun down! One, two, three! -Benjie, help! -What's that? I only know English. -Visayan instead, pal? -Okay, pal. One, two, three! Three! Benjie! -Slowly. -Benjie! Bimbee! Bimbee! Benjie! Are we just going to stare at each other here? What now? Go, love! Hey, fag! How are you? Not so much. I'm the one with the surprise this time. -We're playing Chinese garters? -No. -Okay. -First of all, you're not Chinese. And devils like you have no race. You think you can take me, Benjamin Santos? Absolutely! With or without shorts! You can't because you're gay! Oh, is that so? Hang on! You're not running out. Is this unlimited fighting? -Yes! -Yes! Oh, you want this? Do you want to play? Janjanjaranjan! Wait for me! Oh, please! Sorry, you're not my type. Does it hurt? I am gay, but I'm not just any gay. Bimbee! It's all over. They're defeated. -Yes! We're great! -Yeah! Are you sure the bomb is here? What? Okay. Where? There? All this time, the bomb is just right there. -Yes. -Great, great! -Right? -Santos. Sir, Bimbee and I found the bomb. I already have it. Take them outside, at the parking lot. Parking? What's the address? Joke! Okay, Sir. I'll go there. -Bautista, defuse this. -Yes, Sir. Sir, I can't do this. This bomb is unusual. This shouldn't detonate. Too many will die. Yes, Sir. Bimbee, do you remember anything that your mom said? Look, an image appeared. PUSH IT There. It's like... looks like we have to do what they're doing. Okay. Come, let's just dance! It's working. You're right. The clock's slowing down. We should all dance. Why don't you join, Sir? -Go ahead. -Then we won't dance. -So we would all just explode! -Please, Sir. -Yes, Sir. -Let's all dance! -Game. -Just follow the image. -There. -Just follow the image. -Yes! -Yes, it stopped! -Yes! -Yes! Santos. Remember the condition you told me? I'll do it now. No biggie. I can just let it go. Wait. Turn around, Bimbee. The following scene is rated SPG. Strict parental guidance is advised. You're such a party pooper, Bimbee. Drop it, Benjie! It's just a kiss. Bye! Let's leave them! -Wow. Thank you. -Happy birthday to you! -For real? -Just kidding! Is it true that you're not going back to the service? Yes, sir. I'm planning to relax a bit. I want to focus on my family. We need you again, Benjie. I'm assigning you a juvenile delinquent... who wants to be a soldier. He shows promise of being a great soldier like you. Okay, sir, but... I'd like to be with my family first. Is he here now? You can invite him in. There's plenty of food. Okay. James? James... James Anred. Col. Benjamin Santos VIII. Hi. Nice to meet you. How are you? When does the training start? In my house or at the camp? I'm okay anytime. I'm not busy. You can start anytime. How are you? How handsome. Soft hands.
