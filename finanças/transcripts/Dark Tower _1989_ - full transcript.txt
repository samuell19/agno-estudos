Construction on the last section will begin next week. Then we can finish the interiors. - Mrs. Page. - Morning, Ricardo. These ceramic tile wall systems will have less structural weight than masonry or pre-cast systems. Here let me take those. Yes, she's a delightful woman. Thank you. I have something for you, Pierre. I hope to work with you again. What do you think? Thank you very much. I want you to take this with you. Good day, gentlemen. Gracias, Miguel. Buenos dias, Pedro. Any messages, Titty? Oh yes, tons. Charlie here. We've got an emergency at Unico tower. Some poor bastard just dropped 20 stories. How the hell did that happen, Charlie? Beats me. All I know is William's got his hands full over there with two bodies. Two? Yeah, the one that did the nosedive and landed on the Unico exec. Crushed him. Sorry to spoil your vacation, guy. Okay. So what's going on? You're gonna love this one. The guy who got flattened. Yeah? He was a top Unico man in Europe over here on an inspection tour. Why can't the local cops handle it? Well, they're going to. Unico people called them in personally. Denny, you know they're threatening to cancel our contract. Yeah. Come on. They figure it's our responsibility. It's central to watch out for those things. Will you cut it out? For falling window washers? Well you know. They figure it's a pretty strange kind of accident. Well, I am surprised it doesn't happen more often. Yeah. Oh yeah. Something else. We got ourselves a witness. Yeah, who? Carolyn Page, the architect. The one who designed this building? Yeah, she figures he was pushed. I think she's nuts. Where is she now? In her office. 20th floor. Hey, it could be your lucky number. She's already spoken to the police. We figured that, but we'd like to hear from her directly. Okay? It's all right. So tell us what you saw. I was working in here and he was outside cleaning the window. You ever seen him before? No, never. Suddenly I heard something from over there. I looked up and he was thrashing about. His head was banging the window. I ran over, but there wasn't anything I could do. So then what? He was thrown in the air. I know it sounds impossible, but it was as if there was someone out there throwing him. And he was alone? I'm telling you what I saw. Suddenly it was over. There was nothing I could do. Nothing. I think I'll go check out the roof. It's a windy day. Up this high a man can get picked up like a feather. Wasn't the wind. You don't believe me, do you? I believe that you believe it. But the odds are he was having some kind of attack. He was having a stroke or convulsions. What kind of convulsions can make a man pound his head against a plate glass window? You've seen a man die, Mrs. Page. That's a hard thing to deal with for someone like you. Someone like me. You don't know me. There's thrown wind possibly. Sure, hurricane season. Who the hell is gonna train a kamikaze window washer? You know what dedication that must take? it was just an idea. Christ. Blood all over this thing like he was bashed around. Good morning, Randall. It's good to see you again. This must be big if you're here, Joseph. He took off the safety belt. I think maybe he tried to kill himself. You mean when he couldn't smash his brains out on the window, he decided to jump? There are many stranger deaths then this one. However, if you discover he was a terrorist, you will let us know. I look forward to your reports, gringos. Don't disappoint me, por favor. You know something, Jim. I hate heights. Tell me about it. So you give Charlie all the details. Oh, come on, man. It's your turn. It's always my turn. I'm not giving up any vacation on this. I'm already 10 minutes late for Elaine. Come on, you're gonna let a woman control your life? It's one thing to let Unico control your life. No, I'm not gonna let Unico control. But a woman? Come on, Denny. Is Dennis Randall there? No. No message. Thank you. I have a few more questions. Bullock, Bullock. Bullock. Can you read me? Come on. Where the hell are you? Did they find anything wrong with the elevator? No, sir. The police are still checking it out. Oh, really? Are they working there now or are they at lunch? At lunch. I'll be right back. Anything more? Nothing. Yeah, Randall. Hello. This is Carolyn Page. Feeling better? A little. Thank you. Sorry if I seemed rude. I was wondering if you had any new information. The window washer. I just wanted to know if he was sick like you said. You mentioned he might've had convulsions that might've caused the accident. The autopsy's not been completed, so can I get back to ya? Yes, of course. I'm most anxious to know. Come in. Come in. Titty, I heard someone at the door. No. No, I didn't see anybody. Oh, don't forget. You've got lunch today with the Warren people. I'm on my way. Why don't you take a few days off? You could certainly use the rest. I can't. Got to finish those renderings. See you later. Jesus Christ. Not in a million years. Not in a million goddamn years would I expect William to flip his lid. He couldn't have. What do you mean? We got four bodies and 20 witnesses say he did. I was with him two hours ago and he was fine. Two hours ago. Well, he could've snapped. But not to Williams. There's no way. There's no goddamn way. There's something screwy here. Wait a minute. I thought you were on vacation. Charlie, you told me a long time ago. The once is happenstance. Twice is coincidence. Three times is enemy action. This is the third time. What the hell are you talking about? The window washer's one. The security guard is two. And this is three. Keep me informed. Williams. Doesn't make any sense at all. Not at all. Not Williams. One minute you're fine. The next minute you're a fucking psycho. A mass killer. It's gotta be some goddamn thing here to explain it. It's nuts. I know the whole fucking world is nuts. That's the problem. Schools, military, police fine. No medical problems. No abnormal personality traits. Okay, he's anal retentive. So are 20 million other bastards. They don't go berserk with a 38 special. How about you, sweetheart? What deep, dark secrets are you hiding behind those big, brown eyes? Seem proper. A little ambitious. Talented. Have quite an effect on people. Even me. Who's in the building tonight? I'll check. Who's on 28? Nobody I know of. Everybody's checked out. No, please. Are you alone? Who else is here? There's no one here. I haven't heard anyone. I haven't seen any one. What are you doing here at this hour? I have work to do. I often stay late. This is the second time someone's pointed a gun at me today. Tell me about it. I was downstairs in the lobby when the shooting happened. Why didn't you wanna talk to the police? I didn't want to tell them. Your friend, he wanted to kill me. They tell me he wanted to kill everybody. No, he was aiming at me. Yeah? Why are you so special? Who's that? My husband. He died two years ago. What's the matter? Are you all right? Yeah, I'm fine. Mr. Randall? Everything all right, Mr. Randall? Yes. False alarm. I'll phone you tomorrow. Is my car outside? Yes, ma'am. Elaine. What's wrong? Phillip Page. Ever hear of him? Phillip Page. No. Oh, wasn't he that architect who did your building? Yeah. I'm sorry about Williams, but what's Phillip Page got to do with this? I'm not sure. What do you know about him? Randall, the council keeps tabs on American citizens. It's not my department. I keep tabs on other things. Well, I've got to talk to somebody who knows about him. Wanna help me? Might know somebody who knew your Phillip Page. Tell me about his private life. All I know is he was married for 20 years when his young, hot shot designer, straight out of parsons went to work for him. Carolyn. Or should I say on him? So, the first wife got tossed out the window and Carolyn shot right up the ladder, not that she didn't have talent. She had a hell of a lot more than that asshole husband of hers ever did. Anyway, after five years, she completely overshadowed Phillip. She always gave him the credit though. Still I think the bastard resented it. You know, professional jealousy and all that. I suppose you heard the rumors about Unico tower. Rumors? Unico was Phillip's personal account. When Carolyn discovered they were about to scrap his designs she protected them by running over to Unico with her plans and sold them on her concept. I know because I was up until 11 o'clock the night before shooting the artwork for her. What about his death? He'd had a couple of close calls before. Once on his boat. And once driving back from Gerona. Carolyn was working late as usual and Phillip just never showed up. She contacted the police. They did some checking around. Found out he'd been boozing it up at Antonio's on the Wharf and figured he just stumbled off the pier. Swoosh right off to sea. He couldn't swim. Carolyn was just beside herself. God knows why. If it were me, I'd have been shooting off fireworks. She was really broken up at the funeral because they'd never found a body. Wanted him to have a decent Christian burial, you know. Final eternal rest and all that bullshit. You ask me, that'd be too good for the prick. Thanks. Hello. Carlos. Well, what'd you think? Are you sure? You're absolutely certain the wall can take the stress? Fantastic. Then we begin next week. I'll show you some samples in the morning. What you mean don't worry? I want to be perfect, Carlos. I put my whole life into this project. I'll see you in the morning. There's gotta be something here somewhere. My hunch is right. Wait a minute. Hunch. Let me see. Yeah, this is it. Would you look at that? You got some credentials, Dr. Gold. Let's get together real soon. Hi, Joseph. I was hoping I'd find you here. Randall, I thought you were paid to protect the people in that building not to shoot them. Do you remember Phillip Page? Tried to walk on water. Didn't make it. You remember what the autopsy showed? There wasn't one. The river moves too fast to find bodies in it. So Randall, I've never seen you like this. You seem very worried. Is there something about Williams that you want to tell me? I wouldn't know what to tell you, Joseph. Well, whatever it is, you won't forget your responsibility to keep the local police informed. No, don't worry, Joseph. Number from one to ten. Five. Color. Red. Color. Blue. Color. Green. Color. Red. Blue. No, blue. Number from one to ten. Nine. Six. Nine, but you were looking at it upside down. Number one to ten. Four. Four. Color. Red. Red. She's amazing. Truly amazing. Okay. See you next- Tuesday. No, Wednesday. I knew everything that girl was gonna say. What? Numbers, colors. All of them? Yeah. Have you always been able to do that? No. Well, sort of. I was thought of them as lucky hunches. Oh, no, no, no. That's a form of clairvoyance. Your ability to predict or experience an event before it happens, we call that pre-cognition. You'd be surprised how many people are able to do it. Do they always happen the way you see them? That depends. On what? On how much you trust it. Well, I think what you told me about might be something very special, very rare. But then again, could be nothing. Just an unusual set of events and circumstances. How do you find out which it is? I ask the right questions, analyze the subsequent data, and hope to hell I know what I'm doing. Oh, that's interesting. The police never found your body. Regular Houdini. Police believe Page's body was swept out to sea during the violent rainstorm Friday morning. Saved some funeral expenses, doesn't it? Oh come on, wake up, Gold. There's work to be done. Carolyn Page elected president of Page Design at the national architect- Are you Dr. Gold? Oh, Miss Tilly Ambrose. You're Mrs. Page's executive assistant. Please do come in. I did try to tidy up before. Can I offer you some wine? Yes, thank you. Now. Please. There you are. Now then. How long have you been working for Mrs. Page? A little over a year. Then you haven't. You never met her husband. No. Are you doing some work for us? You might say that I'm subcontracted to another firm that works for you. Are you married? No. I prefer to drink instead. Certainly come to the right place for it. Tell me. Does Mrs. Page intend to remain here? As far as I know. Why? Well, firm has offices in London and in New York. She must have visited both places a lot. Probably has many friends. I wouldn't know. I've never met any of her friends. Just business associates. I see. Carolyn doesn't have time to socialize. She's a workaholic. She's incredible. I don't know how she does it. Well, I certainly hope that she doesn't make you put in all those hours there. Carolyn is very kind and considerate. She doesn't expect anyone to be like her. That's good. A woman alone in a deserted building at night, that can be very scary. Start to see things. Hear things. Something wrong? No, no. It's just that I remembered I have some shopping to do and I don't think I have anything more to add to this conversation. Thank you for the wine. My pleasure. Leave me alone. Leave me alone. Come in. So what's going on? On the phone you were half out of your mind. I'm better now. You saw something, didn't you? No. What'd you see? Nothing. I can't help you unless you tell me what you saw. I don't want to talk about it. I've asked an associate to join us. Mrs. Carolyn Page, yes? I'm Dr. Max Gold. I have been anxious to speak with you. I have a few questions about the window washer. Max is helping me. Is he? What kind of doctor are you? I'm a parapsychologist. What kind of nonsense is this? If you've seen something, what's wrong with you? What's wrong with me? Parapsychologist? Why not a witch doctor or one of those gypsies that tell your fortune? From now on, keep the hell out of my affairs, Mr. Randall. Now. I want you to set it up for tonight. I don't want any interference and that includes you. I can handle that. How long does this usually take? You could find something in 10 minutes, but then maybe never. Patience is a necessity in this business. And what happens when you're convinced that there's really something there? It depends. On what? On what it wants. Unico Tower lobby, April 8th. Investigation number 8828. Dr. Max Gold for the Institute for Psychic Research. Temperature. 67 degrees Fahrenheit. Time. 8:30 p.m. Unfinished lobby 28th floor. Seems to be nothing. Temperature normal. All right, back to the elevator. 30th floor. So far nothing. Nothing. Are you there? Hello. I mean. Are you real? There's a presence here. I think. I can't tell you what a thrill this is. All my life I've waited to once just once to make contact. Oh, I guess I better introduce myself. My name is Max Gold. I was born 61 years ago in Vienna. My father, God rest his soul, was a student of rights. I'm not a psychoanalyst. Although I do have a tendency to analyze myself. I'm a parapsychologist. I've been studying paranormal phenomenon for over 30 years. I guess that makes me a pioneer. Although my colleagues seem to be getting most of the limelight. Now. Do you think we could have a talk? Let me put it this way. A little chat will do us both some good. Don't you think? What you want is to rest but you can't because something is troubling you. Am I right? Tell me. Am I right? That's a good one. You had me going there for a minute. There's no sense in being shy, is there? As I said, a little chat would be good for both of us. You would gain eternal rest and I would gain recognition. Well of course, there's no shame in not getting recognition, even if you deserve it as much as I do. Still, it would be nice. Especially after you had to endure insults like me. Imagine calling a man like me a quack and a charlatan. I'm a respectable scientist. I have over 30 years of research. So. How 'bout it? Shall we have a chat? Okay. I'll leave for now. I can help you. Boy, it's never easy. Elevator seven. Time. 9:15. Temperature. Wow. Randall, we're gonna need help. Let's go. Whatever it is, it's trying to communicate. Apparently through you. Sure as hell doesn't wanna talk to Max Gold. Why me? Who knows? But it's the finding out that's fun. Fun? Yup. What the hell do you mean fun? I know these phenomenon. I bet you're a riot at wakes. I'm damn sure it's you it's after. Why doesn't it just talk to me if that's what it wants? 'Cause you wouldn't hear it. Oh, you've got psychic ability, all right, but it isn't developed or trained. We need an experienced medium. You don't have psychic abilities, do you? Nope. That's why I study people that do. Keep hoping it'll rub off. You can have mine. I don't understand any of it. Very few people do. This thing. What is it? A presence. A spirit. Call it whatever you want except human. Can it be killed? Well, it's dead already. To clear it, to get rid of it, we have to listen to it. Hear what it has to say. And then what? Then it can rest in peace... Hopefully. Max, let me die in peace. I've seen too much already. We need you, Sergie. We need a man with your experience. This thing is rough. It's already killed several people. Now, Sergie. I need you to make contact now. Tonight. Don't worry. We'll do it tomorrow. He's gone. Sergie's disappeared. No, I found a note taped to his door. It said life is short, live it up. You've got three hours and 12 minutes to find me. How should I know? We better go after him fast. I have an idea where to look. Are you all right? Yes. Yes, I'm fine. Titty, I want to finish those renderings today, so no interruptions, no calls, no problems. Okay? He's not exactly instilling me with confidence, Max. I don't like it, Sergie. I don't like it at all. You have us both on edge. Sergie, Sergie, my friend, what is going on? I've never seen you like this before. The time has come. I am ready to spit in the eye of death. I won't be but a second. Well, I guess she took my advice. She needed some time off. Come on, the show starts at seven. Oh Christ. Oh. Titty. Is anyone there? Please, somebody. Please come with me. Please. There's no use. Come on. It's waiting for us. All right, enough is enough. Stop playing games. Things are getting a little out of hand. You know? Strange, unexplained murders. Know about them, I assume. You do. No, no, no, no. With you transmitting an extraordinary amount of energy, I assume that you realize I have nothing against you personally, but the contrary. I'm only a man trying to do his job, trying to unravel this puzzle, trying to figure out why you're here. Help me. I can't believe I've spent a lifetime trying to make contact. How can I leave now? You're the first real contact I've ever made. I'm not gonna leave. I told you I'm not gonna leave. You're not going to stop me. Do you understand? I'm going to find out whether you like it or not. You're still here, aren't you? Carolyn, what's wrong? What's going on in here? What happened? Is she all right? God knows. We're gonna get you out of here. He won't let you. Don't even try. Max, watch out. It needs to kill. Randall, come over here with me. She doesn't need any help. Do as he says. God, man, get over here. Do as he says. Randall, tell me what you see. I'm walking. Louder. It's cold. Cement. I can't breathe. Where? Where are you? My building. My building. It's mine, not hers. Randall. What are you doing here? Stop it. Bring him out of it. What is happening? Concentrate. What is happening? What are you doing here? Stop it. Stop it. Who are you talking to? A dark hole. Help. Stop it. Stop it. What's happening, Randall? Who's with you? No. I'm drowning. I'm drowning. Someone pushed you? Is that it? Who pushed you? Carolyn! You killed him. Yes. I killed my husband. I followed him here one night. I came up from behind and I pushed him. I pushed him over the edge, down into an unfinished pile. He was still alive, so I opened the shoot and buried him under an avalanche of concrete. Randall. Please understand. He had to die. He was... evil! I tried to leave him, but he wouldn't let me. Randall... Please. Please. Oh my God. No! Let go. God. Let go. Let go. Get away. No! Well Max, you finally made contact. And what good did it do him? Not a hell of a lot. Do the police know anything more? She's still listed as missing. What do you think? I think I wouldn't work there late at night. Come on, let's forget about it. I don't want anything else ruining the rest of our vacation. You got the plane tickets? Right here.
