* Please help me. My lucky day, a visitor. Oh, God. Please help me. Tell me, human... what brings you so close to your own death? And what brings such a frail little human to my dilapidated domicile? I... What are you? What is your name? C-Catherine. My name is Catherine. You're not one of them, are you? One of who? You need to not fear me, Catherine. I read what was in that file... So, it's true then. You're a-- A victim, Catherine, held here against my will, experimented on like an animal. I don't believe this. I-I can't. Can't believe what is right before your eyes? As you said, you read their dossier, did you not? We could spend our time arguing the legitimacy of my existence vis-Ã -vis your pragmatic refusal to believe... or we could... ...we can help each other... survive. What's happening out there? What-what is happening? You-you-you don't know... the structure you have entered. I-I just ran in here. I was-I was on my way home from work. I... ...wanted to get home to call my mother. She's been sick. She's been sick, and I wanted to see if she was okay, and I wanted to see if she'd go to church with me in the morning. There are explosions and screams, lights- there are lights in the sky, wailing lights all from above. I saw a group of kids running from the building that was on fire. There's blood on their faces. They-- There are so many explosions. All the buildings were crumbling and-- What is going on out there? Indeed, the time has come, Catherine. The time? Yes. The rats have overrun the kingdom. Now, they must be exterminated. You're dying? You must help me, Catherine, please, please, please, please. Please don't-don't fear me. They tried so hard to destroy me... ...to wipe my kind from the face of the Earth. So cruel, so cruel, so intolerant... ...oh, they were. Please. Help me. Help. Help. Help me. Help me. Help me. What did you-what did you do to those two men? I did nothing to those men. I did nothing to those men. They were- they were crushed from above. You can-you can clearly see that, Catherine. But they don't look the same as they did. And the blood on your-- And I read what was in that file. Lies! Lies. All lies. They kept me imprisoned here for decades, the last of my kind. Why would I wish for this world to continue? So the brilliant minds of your species can keep me here luxuriating at the excrement of my own lowliness? They called your kind... predatory. They said you fed on humans and drink their-- They have always thought such heinous things about us, Catherine. From time immemorial they have sought to exterminate us because they feared us, because they did not even try to understand us. We had our place in this world. We are as old as the planet itself, but your kind couldn't, wouldn't share that with us or anything else, for that matter. They have desecrated every square inch, eradicating life forms that have survived for millennia. Oh, they envied us. Oh, how you loathsome cunts envied us... but it was ignorance and fear that consumed them, controlled them, never realizing that all along it would mean their own demise. I-I don't understand. The end has come... an end to your abysmal reign, an end to everything you were and everything you dreamed you could be. Your wombs have dried. The seed in your men has gone sour. The blood in your veins is but a winter creek drying in the summer sun. You aren't the first to wander at the brink of extinction... where it all went wrong. Fortunately, you'll be the last... at least the last that was birthed on this world. What is going on out there?! What are those things, the lights in the sky? Where do they c-- Help me. Help me. Be the one, Catherine, the one kind human to undo decades of hatred, of torture, humiliation that your kind has inflicted on me. Please. Do you believe in God, Catherine? I do. Please, come here. Please. Please. Please. Please. Please, help me. Please. Please. Please. Please, help me. Please. Please. You'll find nothing in there to help you. It seems that we are tomb-mates, Catherine, but unlike your Christ, you will not rise from here. You know what's going on out there, don't you? Tell me. I know many, many things to all, human. There isn't enough time left to even begin to offer you the depth and breadth of my knowledge. - Tell me. - And even there were... your brain lacks the capacity to use it. Tell me! Things have run their course, Catherine. You would be doing yourself a favor if you would just let me kill you now. Well, since I have nothing to lose and nowhere better to be, try me. Yours was always an amusing species. What do you want to know? I wanna know what you are, why you're here, why are you locked in the metal coffin or... whatever that is. I've been imprisoned here for decades being studied and interrogated by the brilliant minds of your military, while you human maggots struggled to cope with an extinction you can't possibly comprehend, much less stop, and only you dare to ask me to explain who I am. No, really. I want to know. And since, as you say, I can't hope to save myself, then why not? Let it be the last bit of knowledge I glean before I am vaporized. Futile and illusionary, so human. Perhaps, but what have you got to lose? Amuse yourself at my expense, like one last story. Droll human... ...maggot. I think you can do better than that. I would think someone with your acute intellect would be immune to such simplistic insults. I could cast aspersions at you for a hundred years and still not even scrape the surface of my distain for your kind. Now, who's being droll? Oh, so, you're a- you're a smart one, Catherine. Well, I was a philosophy major and I minored in religious studies only to find out that there's only teaching positions available in those fields. Apparently, I thrive on futile intellectual pursuits. How well do you know your own homunculus history? It's my favorite subject on Jeopardy. Did you know in the 14th century a judge decreed that cats were evil? It was their little glowing eyes and their pension for traipsing about on their little paws at all hours of the night. What kind of creature practiced such behavior and had such unearthly features? Why, a diabolic creature, of course. The church ordered all the cats to be rounded up and destroyed. Burn the witches, destroy their familiars. And if they couldn't call the devil out, why, they would wipe his minions from the Earth. And do you know what happened next? The rat population it was- they were free to propagate and with the rats came the plague, which wiped out one-third of the human population. Your foolish ancestors saw no correlation, of course. Nearly a century later, Pope Innocent VIII ordered all the felines destroyed... and again.... And you were there to... enjoy the show? You humans, you've always been quite an amusing species. Always, the architects of your own doom time and time again. - I-I don't understand. - Of course, you don't! Maggot. So, you're ready, then, to grapple with your own history and accept it regardless of all the light that cast upon all the delusional notions of superiority your race hold so dear? If we're all to die, then I want to know why. There were always those of your kind, a few who possessed more courage, who could face the truth. They were, of course, scorned, derided by their less humble peers... many assassinated... but-but I look at you, Catherine, and I can see... a twinkling of that courage in your eyes. It was a different world, a different reality. You cannot begin to imagine the way the wind tasted then, the way the world smelled and felt to the touch. There was nothing that needed understanding. The world needed only to be sensed. Time did not exist. The need for numbers did not exist. No science, no logic, no currency, no religion. There was spirit in everything, but it didn't need to be debated. It just was. Just was. It's a reality that you could never understand and I doubt you could even imagine it as it truly was... before... before... before. And there were no words, no confusion of tongues. Our life was magical. - But. - Yes, yes, yes, yes, I know, I know. I know. I know what you're thinking. Of course, there was death, but it was natural, a part of the tapestry of being. There's always been death where there is life, but intelligent creatures then understood how interconnected it all was. They instinctively knew the balance. They lived in a way that rejected and revered this... interconnection. The planet was at peace within this natural construct. Life wasn't studied, questioned.... There was-there was mystery. There was wonder. And there was awe. Were these creatures... human? No. No. No. No, they-they came much later. There were creatures before your kind, similar yet different, but I have yet to witness any species on this planet aside from my own that stayed true to its original way of being. Eventually, they always want more. For a snake to be consumed by a wolf is an honorable death. Humans have no honor. They fight with their hearts, not with their minds. Theirs is a legacy of thoughtless and brutal insanity. There's no relation to the law of nature in human destruction. Not only do humans endanger their own existence, desecrate the ground, the air, the water, and the precious life that it gives, humans have polluted their own minds, not just the lemmings... but the most powerful leaders willingly deceiving themselves rather than face the horror they have become all the while unable and ill equipped to examine their reflections. And you call yourselves civilized. What happened to them? There've been cycles-cycles on this planet... many species who claim themselves superior to all things while losing sight of their place in the tapestry of creation, their true, wonderful, insignificance. Like humans, we all rose up, evolved, climaxing into the state of arrogant inebriation. Drunk with power, infested by delusion. My kind watched and grew to despise every one of them. We watch as they watched you. They? Who's they? You think you know the ending to this story, eh? So typical of you humans, always rushing headlong to know the endings of stories, never once savoring the beauty of the how and the why of the whole story. Your minds are overloaded with noise and chatter from your insidious gadgets and computers. The ending doesn't answer your question, Catherine, any more than the beginning. - Riddles. - No, no. No riddles, human, only truth, and truth is rarely ever as succinct as you want it to be, especially if that the truth cannot be easily grasped by the simple minded. Then tell me how they perished. Was there a- was there a cataclysm of-- Irrelevant! You haven't the time for me to recount the many extinctions I have seen. The reasons are as varied as the stars, but they all share the same result. You humans have lasted much longer than I would have ever thought possible, much to your credit, but like all others before you, you are blind to your own reflections, and how wonderful for me to watch your kind evolve into rancid rats lost in a maze of your own creation. This time the effects of your honorable, yet short tenure, are far more profound. The cycle ran its course. You humans have been a surprisingly adaptable parasite. Of course, I imagine there was some hope at the beginning that you would prove to be the greatest of life forms, that you would harness your true potential spiritually, biologically, intellectually. Bring the earth back to a pure state. I imagine those souls of yours are quite intriguing to them. They're quite advanced, even my kind could see that. No wonder they had hope for you, but of course, your kind did nothing of value. The end. Quite the contrary Forgive me, but my body is attempting regeneration. Similar- similar to your sleeping. Pardon me. So, what does any of this mean to you? Believe it or not, I too detest much of what my race has done, but unlike you I don't think we are hopeless maggots. I believe in a higher power. Ah, yes, God. Jesus is my heart and soul. Jesus? No. Jesus, the greatest illusion of them all. Just ask Constantine about Jesus. For Christ's sake. I believe in God. One of your most desperate inventions. You don't know anything about God. Oh, your insidious and boring delusions. My faith is not a delusion. Oh, you-you invented god because the knowledge of nothingness beyond what's far too much for you to bear. You have no real connection to the source of eternal creation. No connection to yourselves. Let alone the true order of the cosmos the ever-expanding source that is nothingness. Everything and nothing. Things will run the course. The fate of your world rests in the hands of... the others. How have you survived for so long? How have you adapted? Your scientists have never understood our adaptability. After all the years I've been imprisoned here they've not gleaned one thing, all the while exhibiting the ability to acknowledge your inherently destructive behavior, let alone repair it. The pattern is to continue to uphold the illusion at all costs, knowing that there is no real solution. No hope, no hope to stop the madness they have cultivated for so long, the destruction of your own lives, and what's more, endangered life beyond the Earth is utterly pathetic. Are you not disgusted with yourselves? I can't justify anything they've done to you or your kind. Until today... I never really knew you existed. Yet... like them, you fear me, Catherine. You abhor me. - I'm not scared of you. - Don't patronize me, maggot-breeder! With all your technological and scientific progress, you're just a tribe of apes... huddled around a dying fire... eyes wide, wide, wide, wide with terror from the noises of the night. Perhaps you've misunders-- Human, if I were not sitting here in this crippled state... I would-I would... snap your spine for your glib and flippant delusions. Your kind systematically wiped mine from the face of this world. It was genocide. And only I remain. All I have to do now is bide my time. Not much fun. All-all I want is to return to-- Just to-just to-- I just want to return to the void, the all-encompassing void for which my kind came. However... at the moment my actions... are a bit limited. You're flesh and blood. Biologically, you're not that different from us. I read that in your file. You're healing capabilities are stronger... your organs and bones more resilient, but genetically, you're not that far removed. Boring. Boring. Boring, boring, boring, boring, boring. So human! We were not always like this, like human form, walking, talking, consuming, defecating, we came from the ether, born with the first light on this world... What we were is no longer possible. We were part of the- of the genesis of all life. But before that, really-- No, no... Our origins are more ethereal than yours. We came to take on the forms we've used for these last few millennia. We knew the limitations of this... this flesh. We had our reasons... Let's just say it was more convenient for our needs. We've evolved too far to return to our original and purer state. You spoke of the souls we possess. Are they not enough to warrant a stay of execution? Souls. Souls. Souls. It was merely a figure of speech. They call them containers because you're all living on borrowed time. Well, I believe in the soul. Yes, yes, yes, yes. You also believe baby Jesus and... Santa Claus who by the way, used to be a real demon to keep you rodents in check and all that time locking your doors and windows with the sun setting. Ask yourself, Catherine, do those souls deserve such... treacherous hearts, such adolescent minds? Most of your kind, they've forsaken their souls for shallow and frivolous gains, Your salvations, is irretrievable. What did you think about in here while you were imprisoned? Nothing. Nothing? Nothing at all, human. You couldn't possibly understand the sound of... nothing. So soothing. Oh, what would you ponder, Catherine, if you are in a cage steel canister for decades on end? If you were the last of your kind? What did the last mastodon think as it roamed the great plains in search of food? Watching the stars at night. So, that's it then, everything ends? I die, you die, the whole course of life on this planet simply returns to dust? This is not the first Armageddon! And I will remain! - I know your kind can be killed. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, we can killed but we cannot die. Your kind once understood this as well. I have no fear, Catherine. Your flesh, your minds, your entire legacy will be erased like it never happened and your-and your souls will be recycled but I will remain. If I possessed even an ounce of sympathy for your kind, I would feel sorry for having wasted what little time you have left on such a fruitless conversation. I will remain. Your kind-your kind will be entirely extinguished. Not one spark, not one moment, not one memory, nothing, nothing, just like you, nothing. You would just accept your fate and let me take your life, I promise-I promise I'll do it with tenderness... tenderness, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet tenderness. You bastard. You sit there speaking of purity and souls-- - We were the only hope! You're filth! You're the vermin of this world! How dare you act so holier than thou. In that file it says your kind murdered as many of my kind as we did yours! You're not better than the maggots you claim to despise. We were the only hope this god damned planet ever had for survival, you miserable, Our purpose was as pure as Nature herself. They-they never understood that either, which-which blindly allowed genocide. Now, they accepted the role we were intended to play. What are you- what are you talking about? They treated us disposable, pathetic little playthings, never understanding, they feared us... just as you do. We, too, grew stronger as the centuries passed, and when they discovered that your kinds have become so adept at extinguishing us, they'll just sit back and allow their experiments to fester and grow like a virus-- - Experiments?! I don't-- My blood is liquidated... life force... that has sustained me for all these years. I hated your kind. I am hungry. Help me, please. Stay away from me. Stay away from me. Stay away from me! Get away from me! You're-you're a waste, human, like all the rest of your kind. All your resources, they even gave clues, technology they left for you on that dessert beneath pyramids, and you're still a race of medieval witch hunters. Where are you going to go, Catherine? Where will you run? Even if you could escape from here, there is nothing but a wasteland out there. Make this easier on yourself, human, and submit... to my hunger. * Yes, Catherine, I can read your mind. I can see into your soul, you're borrowed soul. Even in my weakened state, I can invade your thoughts, your hopes, your dreams, your nightmare. Listen to me. Catherine, they kept me here. Your military, your scientist kept me here in the hope that they could unravel the mysteries of my longevity and regenerating abilities. They want to learn how to fuse my DNA with theirs... to create a super race that they could one day rise up against them, to rise up against the gods. They'll return to destroy them. But, Catherine, I know the way. I can make us, you and I, into that super race you and I, Catherine, you and I can build an army. There's still a chance. Listen to me. They come from another planet far, far away. They seeded this planet millions and millions of years ago. Your race, your species showed the most promise of all the life that flourished on this this fertile world, but you failed. You failed so miserably. They've returned to destroy you, to destroy this entire world. We're all aliens, Catherine... we're all from out there. You are an abomination. Just like us... ...but much worse. As bad as we are, as evil as we can be, we always have a choice. We can choose to rise above our ignorance, our savage impulses, no matter how commanding they may be... and that is what I call the soul. You're gonna die out there... If I die today, I'll do it with my soul intact!
