That's it. Yeah. Barbara's gonna love me. Now for the fun part. Daddy's coming home, daddy's coming home. Daddy's coming home tonight. I got all the time in the world, lover girl. Get up. Slowly. Let's define that word, "lover." Blind furry. You always know the right thing to say to a girl. Cute. Sorry, Nigel. My name isn't Nigel. No! Shit! Never buy a house from someone named "mother Hubbard" hey! Sorry, Nigel! Hold it, baby! Have a seat. You know, for all this trouble, we're gonna have to disguise this as a rape, murder Jewel heist. But it is a rape, murder Jewel heist. Will make the disguise all that more affective now, won't it? Can't argue with that. Come on then. Get ready for my 18-Wheeler. Training wheels don't count. Nigel! Your turn. Now hold it, lady. You wouldn't use that. You wouldn't use that in a million years. Ow. Oh that... That hurt! Hey, take it easy! Oh! Hey, wait! Whoa! Wait a minute! "A million years" is just a figure of speech. In geologic time, it's only a couple of seconds. Another rug related death. Well, shana, I had a screening from you. But never again and no in advance. Sergei, this is my mother, Louise. And you know robby, my fiance. It looks good, Sergei. Yeah, I was just saying, they keep getting better. Thank you. And yes, I do know robby. Lady Louise, it was a real pleasure to meet you. I was very sad to hear about the passing of the colonel. Thank you, Sergei, thank you. Are you coming to robby's going away party tonight? Of course I will. Where is it gonna be? At the junior officer's mess hall. What about the place you were staying? Where I'm house sitting? Yes. No guests allowed. I wish you had told me that before you set me up there. Well I thought the queen of the bees should have a nicer place to stay than in a small cell like that. Listen, buddy! They don't pay us a lot of cash in the Navy to defend the likes of you. They pay us in freedom. Sergei wasn't saying anything. It's just that your apartment's so small and I have to move anyways, so it gave me a base to look from. No offense. I apologize. I'll see you all this evening? What a jerk. Robby, don't be such a pill. He's my director, I have to invite him. Well, we've got to go. We've got lots to do. Yeah, I'll see you later. I gotta get some stuff at the office. At dad's lab? Yeah. The dream room? Nobody knows where that is, robby. 1 know, I know, it' just a shame his work is gone forever. No, I'm just going to the naval hospital. I'll see you guys later. Can I talk to you for a minute? Fine with me. What's up, Sergei? Roger wratka is going an anti-terrorism commercial. I wanna get you an audition. Who's wratka? That name's familiar. Wratka is that conservative media consultant. He's the one that did the last presidential campaign. Of course, I know his work. Didn't he do that commercial, "red dawn over Massachusetts?" I really don't think so, Sergei. You're gonna turn down Roger wratka? You should be so lucky. He's a very busy man, my dear. He's got a timer on his desk set for two minute phone calls, even for the president. Thank you. He's just so simplistic. I mean, his commercials are so stupid and exploitive. But they work. I'm gonna get you an audition and you're gonna change your mind. I'm not saying the cold war is over but I think we oughta give it a try. If it is, doing one of his commercials will be like doing a period piece. You will be in a museum and I will go. Thank you for trying, Sergei. You're really great to me but wratka? See you this evening. Look beautiful. Gorbachev, freedom is not aright, it's a privilege. Is it freedom to hurt someone's feelings? To say something others might disagree with? To paint a painting I don't like. No! To me, the flag is literally alive. If an old lady and the flag were drowning, I'd save the flag. Being American means being tough. As Lee atwater said, "guns don't kill people, liberals do." Paid for by "Jenkins for senate." Roger, how's it look? Yeah, I'm looking at a cut right now, Andy, it looks good. Excellent. Yeah. We'll start the negative stuff tonight. The real anti-communist stuff. But what about my positive commercials? Positives? Yeah, you know, my new ideas, positives. Look, congressman, positives are for those little media suck heads that jerk off to while we slam dunk this Nazi communist crypto-faggot queer bait Miller. Yeah, but didn't... Trust me, trust me, look, if it worked for the president it'll work for you. I guess so. Okay, yeah, you got 10 seconds more. I got a two minute maximum on phone calls. Now make your point. Well if atwater says... Right, okay, great. I love you, right, don't ever change. Bye. Two minute maximum on any phone call. Strictly enforced. I don't care if it's the President of the United States on the phone, that's why I got the timer. Now you got the photos for that negative Anderson spot? Here they are, sir. The casting people just sent them over. You know, your breasts are looking very lovely tonight, my dear. Thank you, sir. Perhaps you can come by a little bit later on tonight and we'll play "wet nurse." I'd be honored, sir. There's no reason in the world to give up mother's milk. No reason, sir, no reason at all. Keeps me young. Keeps me hip, it keeps me in tune with America. That's what keeps you in touch with the '90s, sir. Absolutely. Absolutely. And I have it on good authority that there's some very high people in the Pentagon who will not use cremora. They have entire battalions of wet nurses just waiting. Let's see what we got there. What is this? Who sent this dog? What is this? Is this somebody's sister? No! Ugh! Ugh, maybe! Woof! Ah, maybe. Well... Interesting. Hey, save it for the party, guys. Oh, what party? Robby's going away party. I took the mess hall down at the base. Hey, that's great. Thanks, shana. We'll see you tonight. Excellent! - See you there, bye. - Okay, bye. They never found the body? Nope, they never found her dad's body. Hey, what the hell's going on out there? Hey, can't a man have any peace and quiet?! Bedlow, it's you! What the hell? How did you? Hey, what're you doing?! Whoa! Hey! Goddamn, let go! Bedlow, when I get out of here, I'm packing heat, I'm gonna get you, you hear me?! Goddamn it. Daddy? Daddy? Daddy, where are you? Shana? What's my daughter doing here? Dad, are you hurt? Shana. Bye, bye, baby. No! No! No! No! Shana and her bloody movies. Hey, that's my sister getting killed. No shit, she's great. They're showing this movie all the time these days. Yeah, it's the shana bedlow film festival. I like it. Which one's this? "B.j. Butt at the o.K. Corral” yeah, one of her early works. Ginger? Dad? Your father? No, I'm so sorry. Must've just been hearing things. Where is that old fart? Clapper on. Clapper on, clapper off. What? Who is this?! Ginger. Dad! Dad, is that you?! What happened?! Ginger, listen to me. I love you but I'm gonna be dead again soon. They'll never let me go now that they've found me. We can get out of here. Shut up! I'm sorry, darling, but listen, no time. What's the matter? Why are you doing this? There's spies everywhere. Don't trust anyone. The good guys are bad, the bad guys are worse. They've taken over the mind control division. Your work isn't safe either. Wratka, remember that name. Rennert, here. Hello dobson, what's up? Guard 34? No, you don't have to, I'll check it out. They're here. I want you girls to let the world know about my work. That's America's best protection. Are you sure we should kill him? Doubt me?! They only let him escape when he told us everything. All we need now is key. Ginger, take this key. You know where we stored everything? After you sold the house? That's where it is. Our research is top secret. The Navy won't let them near it. They'll close the case quicker than Mother Teresa's legs. How about the press? In America? They won't believe you until you give them a tour. You're gonna have to go without them. Leave him alone! Get out of the way! A pretty girl ain't no bulletproof vest. They just don't care, darling. My love to shana. Do we ice the girl too? Of course. Please, wait, just another second. All right. Sentimental fool! You probably think you can get blowjob from her. Damn. All right, enough! Raise your weapon. Hands. And... Fire. - Freeze! What's going... Who's in command here?! Attached to the Navy special forces, first class. Who's the dead man? Colonel Shane bedlow. The scientist? Precisely. It seems that he faked his own death in order to defect. He came back to steal some files. I guess Wilson just got in the way. That's all lies! They kidnapped him! Besides, we heard the guard while we were talking. You know your father was an accomplished ventriloquist. Yes, but... Sir, I ask you, what kind of man would lie to his own daughter? Let's get up, lady! They killed him for this key. What key? Yes, what key? I'll keep my eyes open for that key, although I don't know what she's talking about. A daughter will say a lot of things to protect her father's memory. It's sweet but it's wrong. I'm taking you in. You were very good. Perhaps I can give you blowfish someday. Uuuuh. Nah. Hey! Isn't that your sister? Yeah. She's gotta get a new agent. You know, I shot one of my first movies down here. "O.k. Corral” "b.j. Butt" and the very same, mother. That's the one where you take forever to die, right? What would you say, mom? 15 minutes of screen time from initial incision. I think you need a new agent, darling. I'll see you two later. Mom, aren't you coming? No, you need some time alone. I'll see you at the party. Your mom hates me. No, she's still upset about our dad. I know it's only been a month but is she ever gonna forgive me? Well, you shouldn't have asked her to forge his signature at the wake. But he'd written a letter of recommendation. I mean, no one else knew where your father work was going. I wanted to know. Yawn, I guess. I mean, wiring the brain to holograms so we could confront our memories in the flesh. I'm getting worried about you. I feel like you care more about him dead than me alive. Doll. You might be the only one who wants to use the dream room for good. Everyone else wants to use to for torture or mind control. There's even supposed to be some renegade, anti-gorbachev kgb after the damn thing. Look, I tell you, they kidnapped him! Look yourself! Now, I'm a very open-minded fellow but I don't see a shred of evidence for what you're saying. What are you holding me on? I'm not sure yet. Trespassing? I work here. Resisting arrest? They didn't even try. Comforting a fugitive. I'm gonna lock you in here while I decide what to do. Do a little investigating. You want him dead, don't you mom? Dead is an exaggeration but if I found him in the freezer, I'd serve him for lunch. Mother, I don't know. I'm sorry, dear, he just makes me uncomfortable. Well, he makes everyone feel that way but he's really not so bad. He's a worm. Mom, if you don't like him, just say so. I just think that you might, you might be clutching at stuff because of your father. You know, actually, I think robby has put up with a lot since then. Then why won't you set a date? Because we're not ready. Because you're engaged to a tapeworm. Well, you're on to us, mom. The real reason is we haven't decided whether to have our child the human way or just save ourselves the time and trouble and break off a little segment of robby. Hi. Thought I'd come a little early and help out. Great, thanks. Happy Rob's leaving? Thanks a lot. It's just a joke, take it easy. Sergei, blow up some balloons. Love to. Got nothing else to do. When you hire me, you get your money's worth. You are a crackup, Sergei. I was wondering about your father's work in the dream room. What about it? How do you know about it? Otis the projectionist told me. I was just wondering if it might replace the movies. All you have to do now is just hire a screenwriter, sit out in front of the theater and think. But on the other hand, x-rated films would get a little messy. Yeah, it is amazing but it's all lost. You can't live in the past forever. Sergei, I can't discuss this with you. I don't know how Otis knows about it but it's top secret. Well there is a triangle between the director, a projectionist and his actors that is sacred. Well, whatever. As long as the relevant resemblance is to the Bermuda triangle. Bermuda triangle? That's where I made that Sci-Fi pbs film. "Bermuda bum." Right, the plot was, "what I the Berlin wall "had been built in Bermuda. Damn, no outside line! Security. Is this security? Yeah. Bruce? - Yeah? - Bruce, hi, this is ginger. - Oh yeah. - Ginger bedlow, fourth floor. Yeah. Yeah, you know, funny thing. You know it. Rennert? He's a good friend of mine and somehow he locked me into his office. That rennert for you. Could you come up and get me out? Oh, that'd be great. Great, okay, yeah. ' Big long, big long' ' She's got a brand new color in her hair' ' a can colored green' ' she would love to drive in your way ' "a full love machine ' she's got a favorite couch in her hair' "where you can sit right down' "you can whisper your favorite words ' and watch her head spin round and round' "it's in a big long' "allin a big long' "it's in a big long' ' big long, big long' "it's in a big long' "allin a big long' "it's in a big long can' ' she's got a favorite love in her hair' "where you can both be seen' ' champaign and slippers and gloves on her hand' ' a place where girls can dream, hey, hey ' she's got an Elvis braid in her hair' ' she knew it'd always go far' ' and if you wanna go downtown' "you gotta move on' "it's in a big long, all in a big long I just heard that Roger wratka got shana's picture. Who, pray tell, is he? Wratka's the one that does all those campaign commercials. Which ones? All those heavy-hitting campaign commercials that everybody complains about. Well, he is, actually, he breastfeeds off of new madiens and sells it to children when he's through with them. But it is a good opportunity for her. Free bird! Yeah! Do it! "Soul "possession "soul "possession you know, there is a sacred triangle between a director, projectionist and his girlfriend. Hang on, baby. You okay? Hi, thanks. What happened? What's wrong? Nothing, nothing, I'm fine. Sorry, Bruce, I'll explain later. Shit. "Soul "possession "soul "possession is what she said' "a matter of time' "she's so precious, she's unusual ' ' she's gone more times instant music "soul "possession "She's so precious, she's so casual ' she's gotten more turns than one never' "soul "possession ginger, what's wrong? It was dad, I saw him. He was alive. What? What's happened? Well, ginger says... It's dad. He was alive, I saw him. But they killed him again. - Oh my god. - Yes. Mom. Mom. Are you sure? I know what I saw. They must've tortured him. No one will believe me. But I hid the key. Shall we get it? I already tried, they're guarding the area. The best thing we can do is just lay low. Shana, I gotta go. Commander won't give me leave. It's funny, having gone through this already. Goodnight, all. Ginger, ma'am. I'll walk robby out. I know. Just too awful to believe. I mean, who would do such a thing? I mean, the colonel wouldn't hurt anyone, much less... Louise gonna be all right? Yeah. She and ginger are gonna stay with me awhile. Call you real soon. Bye. Rob, thanks for lending me the air horn. Take care of the horn for me? Robby and his damn air horn. Where's mom? On the couch. Excuse me, soity, excuse me. Why did they do it? Why did they kidnap him?! I was sure robby saw him get on that plane that crashed in the ocean. Maybe the plane was hijacked or... Or diverted and all the other people killed. I don't know. It's all too awful. Tell me what he said. His last words? "My love to shana." What else did he say? Do you know the name wratka? Sure, just recently. Why? Dad said remember it, that's all I know. Okay, listen, the keys are to the locker we stored everything in after the move. That's where the dream room is. Dad built a secret chamber under the locker no one suspects. Who else knows? No one, I just found out. I thought you worked together. He blindfolded me the two times I went. He thought it would be too dangerous for me to know where the room was. And he was right. What's the room like? It's the most beautiful experience. I mean, you feel like you never have to come back. Let's go! We can't, not for a long time. Why? Because they're just waiting for us to lead them. So what do we do now? You stay here tonight. I'll make mom some milk. Tomorrow, turn yourself into rennert. There really isn't a case. In a few years, we'll have a reunion with dad again in the dream room. Goodnight. Love you. Who are these guys? We killed your husband and we would be happy to kill your daughter if she does not tell us where the key is. You killed my husband! You! - Mom! We have no interest in you, lady. It's your daughters who need to do the talking. Hey, where's the other girl? There is no other girl. Right. If you leave, we're gonna kill these two right now! You two, check it out. There was a reason I carried this. Hey, asshole! Mom. The lady was packing heat. Son of a bitch! Are you okay, darling? We have all night to be in pain. Your father would've been proud of me. Love to shana. You girls, you take care of each other. I hate teary death scenes. Mother. You all right? Mom. Mom. Mom, you were great. Crazy but great. You bitch! You and your pussy are gonna pay for that one. Maybe we'll take it out on your sister. Shana! Yes. Do something. Relax. You'll get your turn. Watch, listen, learn. You could use this in your next performance. Critics will remark on how the realism of the performance of the rape victim seems. They call me mojo. More Johnson than you've ever seen. Check it out, Dean, what do you think, huh? Oh, mojo, have a hog there. Oh mojo. What do you say? You ready, baby, huh? Hey, mojo? Did you know that 75 percent of all gang rapists can't getit up? Yeah, well you're looking at the 25 percent that can. They say it has something to do with everyone standing around talking about it. What the? I said, shut that bitch up! Oh, what's the matter, dear? Don't worry about it. This is the way it gets just before it turns into 10 miles of pink steel. Yeah? It always gets incredible soft? What's the matter, darling? Hey, boss, it looks like mojo's nice and slack. Don't, you'll just make him self conscience. I said, shut her up! Hope I didn't break anything. Don't worry, you'll get your turn. Yeah. Hey! Rape! Rape! Rape! Rape! Get Morris Johnson out! I will take care of these. Sonja, I'm sorry. Never use my name! Just another reason to kill them. You saved her honor but not her life. Just a few extra seconds for you to feel guilty. He only would've raped her. Oh, don't listen to her. The joke's on them. I hid the key in that office. Thank you. Last words never disappoint. You have 10 seconds to contemplate the completeness of your failure. Jesus Christ, come on! Come on just one more step! I'm dying, get out of here! Come on! Get out of here! Where is that key I asked you to get? Oh yeah, we searched the office, we couldn't find it. Idiots! I work with idiots! There's an emergency at the kremlin. We've captured American spy that won't talk. We need dream room now! Yeah right, lady. Five minutes. What about five minutes we me in the tub, huh? Why don't you come on in and join me, mojo? Maybe I will while it's hot. Whoa, that's ice cold! Of course! Siberian hot tub. It took me a long time to find in Southern California. It even keeps my vodka cold. Five minutes. This is the worst part of my job but I need leads as fresh as possible. As fresh as the corpses you mean. Let me put on some coffee. Whatever. Just a minute, shana. You're okay. Oh, where's robby, did he call yet? He's not here yet. I'm sure he'll be back soon. Do you have any leads? No. I do have a name, Morris Johnson. "Mojo." But the only problem is, I think you heard that name from your sister concerning a legitimate military action and decided to get a little revenge. What about the other three? Sonja? Her and the others, probably just another Navy guy just like the rest of them. The one's in the masks? Yes. I want robby. Sonja, mojo, there's no one in here. Those are all the known or suspected operatives and no Sonja? I promise you, I wanted to see her but I didn't. There he is. Shit! Sonja, the older sister, she's not dead! If you don't get her, I'm gonna tell them everything! I got nothing to say to you all. Wait a minute, detective, I can't be sure this is him. I don't know if he's the same person. Yeah, it's him. Rennert, some very important people want you to release your prisoner, mojo. Morris Johnson? On his own recognizance. Very piacular. Don't get it. Why do we have to do this? Cause your fiance's a bit too talkative. Just look at it this way, if this were Milan this would be the penalty for picking your nose! Come on. Jesus Christ! Shana, darling, this is robby. Please pick it up! Robby! Robby! The most horrible thing... Wait, shit, I have to turn off the machine. Shana, that's my finger you got there. Oh, Jesus. Baby, you gotta do what they say. All right, honey, but when can I see you? Look, lady, you'll see him when you tell rennert that mojo isn't the guy who did nothing. But I can't, they killed my family! Maybe but nothing's gonna bring him back and pretty soon they're gonna kill the rest of the family you got left. Are you ready, shana? I can't go. I don't think that guy did it. You know, I remembered the name and so when I saw his name on the uniform, I just took a while guess. Are you sure? A lot of what you said checks out. Do you remember that "twilight zone" where the rape victim kept thinking that everyone she saw did it? Right, after her husband killed the first guy. That's me. I saw 10 of those guys on the way home. I'm real sorry. Are you sure? You seemed so positive. I know, that's what's so scary. Then I'll leave you alone. Please call me. Then I'll be going. Yes? We are watching. Very nice. Very, very nice. Where's robby? Wait for his car on balboa island. Please do not entertain any charming thoughts, melodramatic thoughts of revenge. Having robby back will not be all milk and honey. I'll be there, leave me alone! Shana, it's Sergei. You got the audition. Oh, thanks Sergei. Things are really tough right now. Yeah, I know, I heard the news. But I thought, well, it might get your mind off of things. You know, it is Roger wratka, the producer. Wratka? I thought you might... Yeah, I can at that, I can at that. When is it? Friday at three. I wonder who changed her mind. Who got to her?! Sonja, thanks for coming. You're a sloppy operative, mojo. All we need is to find that key. We've searched this entire office over. Then we reconstruct her actions. Dean, where he was. Here? Mojo, sit where she was. Down. Now, reach everywhere she could possible put it. 1 don't see the key... That's not what I said! Reach! Touch! Every single thing. Oh, mojo, really look! I'm looking! You're not! You see? I was right. How you say in America? "Carrot, where carrot is due." Or as they say in your country, "borscht, where borscht is due." I believe we have delivery to make. Robby, are you all right, robby? Robby? "You think he looks bad now? "Wit till you testify. "Love, the bad guys." Mom, dad, ginger. Whoever killed you, whoever defiled your graves, I will find and I will destroy. And dad, rest assured, your life's work will not be used for evil. I'm going to find them all, Sonja, mojo and the ones behind the masks, and they will all die. Hello? Shana? Ben. Yeah, listen, I'm really sorry about what happened to your family. I just heard the news and it's horrible. Is there anything I can do? No, that's very kind of you but we just had a private service. What about robby? They chopped his finger off and now he's catatonic. Well, every cloud had a silver lining. Listen, have you ever worked with a guy named Roger wratka? Wratka? Yes. Yeah, I'm afraid I have, why? Well, I think he has something to do with all this. Let me tell you a little story about wratka. I worked with wratka on a movie that he made called "the Willy horton story." I also knew him in college. I was teaching theater and he was majoring in amateur gynecology. He was the first one to tap the potential of the campus TV station for the student council election. And there was this guy who everybody thought was a total wimp and everybody hated him, right? But wratka made all these commercials showing this guy in soft focus and then he made all these other commercials showing his opponent opening jail cells and releasing all these criminals. Didn't the other guy have any commercials? Well, this is the best part. When it came time for the student council debates and the two candidates were up there, they didn't talk about the issues. They talked about their TV commercials and the kind of image they were trying to project. Who won? Wratka's guy. What school was this? Now you haven't heard of it but right after the new student body president was sworn in, the school went bankrupt. There were massive race riots and everyone was killed. Well, that must take the fun out of class reunions. No one survived. Two people, wratka and his candidate. What happened to him? He's our president now. The president? That's right. The president. From tiny oaks, mighty acorns grow. The point is this, if you want to do anything about what happened to your family, you better do it yourself. Because Roger wratka is protected by the president and nobody's gonna get through to him. Terrorism, the birthmark on the ugly face of communism. It strikes anywhere and I'm congressman axle Jenkins, the casual anti-communist. And a vote for me is a vote for... Shit! - Cut! - What's my line? Cut! Congressman, congressman! Axle, axle. The line reads like this. "I'm congressman axle Jenkins. "A vote for me is a vote for freedom. "A vote for my opponent is, well, "you might as well kill this little girl, "you red commie scum!” Isn't that a little harsh? It's a joke. Oh, the "kill this girl" part? No, the "red commie scum” part. I kinda like the “kill this girl." It's got a nostalgic feel to it. A little McCarthy. All right, everybody back to one! Everybody back to one! Roger, that shana girl's here. Where you got her, in back? I got her back in makeup. She's all ready for the "kill the girl” line. Congressman, take five minutes, okay? Take five. All right. Hello, shana. Roger wratka. Hello, pleasure to meet you. Nice to meet you. You know that car you just blew up? Yeah. It looks exactly like mine. It was. Just a joke. This makeup is not gonna work. What do you think, shana? Yeah, I think it looks kinda fake too. I man, I could try some more if you'd like. It's not the color. It's the actual absence of physical damage to the tissues. Get down and play dead for me. Not bad. Not bad. You see, we're doing an anti-terrorism commercial and our candidate needs to shape an image of his opponent to underscore the murderous ways of the liberals. You become a very important person because you're the person the audience needs to want to live. That lovely, lovely face. Okay, r.W. We're ready! I'm needed elsewhere. We'll be getting back with you. I hate auditions. Frankly, shana, I don't see anything wrong with him. Except for the obvious shock of losing a finger. How'd that happen again? Electric can opener. Can opener? Exactly. You can imagine our shock. And it's very energy wasteful. Well, I was doing this '70s revival play, "love in the age of disco" and robby was helping me. Sort of a sense memory kinda thing. We were using the can opener unsupervised. It was crazy. Well, he can stay a few days if you're concerned. Well, I really would appreciate it. There he is. Just in time, mojo. I thought I was being followed. Relax. The dumb bitch is too afraid to do anything anyhow. The military museum is perfect cover, robby. Only open on the weekends. They can do whatever they want. I'm gonna take you back to the hospital. I got some business to attend to. So what are we here for? You're real touchy, aren't you? We're here to divide up the test. We have the key. We know that key only goes to a certain storage locker. The ultimate storage company. So what's the problem? They have 75 facilities in la alone. That means there are at least 75 lockers 143, so we divide into four, how you say in your country? "Many hands make light work." Or as they say in your country, "it takes more than one gulag to make an archipelago.' I assume you meant that as an insult, Mr. mojo? Yes, I did. Now, boys and girls, let's not lose sight of what has brought us together in common cause. I have no great love for Sonja. Or for her Neo-stalinistic faction of the kgb. Oh, darling, it sounds so naughty when you say that. And she's not a big fan of my clients. The next wave of the new conservative revolution. But we all agree that the new leaders of the Soviet union have, how should we say, confused the issues to the people on both countries. Anything we can do to help Sonja helps us both. And I have not put 10 congressman, 20 senators and a president in the office to watch all of our values and our rhetoric made a mockery of by some peace mongering ruski! Present company accepted, my dear. You're right, boss, I'm sorry. Sorry, Sonja. It's okay. None of it are new to me. Well, let's get to work. I'm gonna go down there with a different hairdo and everything and make like these artillery shells turn me on and stuff. Just when he lets his guard down, "bam, bam" right into the base of his skull. One-by-one, the little scum will fall. Yeah, I think this is her. Thanks. Hello, is anyone here? Hello? Yes? I'm here for the museum. Didn't you see the sign? It's closed on weekdays. I must've missed it. Maybe you can give me the private tour, kind sir. Perhaps I will at that. I heard you've got a lot of big guns. What's your name? Charlotte. Charlotte Ann. Charlotte Ann, huh? I knew a girl looked just like you once. Really? But her name was shana. Hmmm, I have a sister by that name. Do you? Mm-hmm. Well there's only one real way to find out. My shana always carried a gun in her purse. What?! Whoa, what do we have here? Yup, thought I knew you. Didn't you go to Rydell high? No, went to school, here, on the planet earth. Did you now? Don't you remember me? The boy most likely to fuck your brains out? Must've been a different class. It was a big school. Let me refresh your memory, bitch. Come on. Wait. What for? Wait, I have an idea. Your boss, Roger. Yeah? He appreciates pretty girls, right? Yeah. Now, he'd be real impressed if you brought me back untouched. Am I right? Yeah. So, make me a present or something. To him. I'll make sure he gives you a shot. I'll even put in a good word for you. Really? Sure. Finders keepers, am I right? So, but this way, you get bonus points. Yeah, yeah, I'll go call him right now. No, no, no, no. Let's make it a surprise. Yeah, yeah. Let's get out of here. No, no, no, no, we'll take my car. I ain't falling for that. You drive. No tricks or I'll blow your brains out. Buckle up, babe. Go over the bridge. Hey, I know that guy. Go over by those pre-built houses. Hey, pull over, will you?! Why? I'll blow your brains out. I don't want... Look out! Let's get going. Your bimbo outfit kinda matches the interior of my car. No more fucking tricks, you understand? Okay. No tricks. Where are you going?! I said no tricks! Now pull over! You're not gonna do anything. You're right, I'm not, the jerk asked me. I can wait. Well, look out. Look out! Goddamn, I just got done paying for this thing! What're you doing?! Making a stop. I've got a wife, kids, four, five, six of 'em! No you don't! I could! Wait! Hey! You could learn a lot from a dummy. Dean, Dean, Dean, only your first name. Yes, very nice. Shit. I've learned something from all these stupid movies. Usually a few more guys around. Fuck! Wonderful, shana, shana, beautiful! Perfect! Perfect! Come on down here. You looked great, you looked so natural. That was wonderful. Sorry this little extravaganza here. But, you know, most callback auditions, they're so boring, they're so monotonous. People get all worked up. I do kind of a reverse stansloski thing here, you like it? I was using live ammo. Oh, right, so were we! Isn't that terrific? I mean, it gave a lightness, a realism for the scene. You start the... I hate callbacks. How're you doing, honey? I tell you, auditions get weirder every day. Hello, miss bedlow. He's doing much better today. Oh, it was nice to see you. Thanks, Ellen. No problem. Doctor says you're getting better. He likes your vital signs. I got mojo. The guy that got mom, dad, ginger and did this to you. I didn't even have to shoot him. It was just another traffic statistic. Now I just got a couple more to go. Next it's gonna be Dean. I got his address out of mojo's book. Think I'll pay him a visit in the morning. Yeah? What do you want, doll? Fuller bush sales girl. Don't you mean, "Fuller brush?" No mistake, fella. Wanna see a sample? Yeah, sure. Come on then. Oh, shit. Shit! Shit! Wait right here, okay? Just wait, I'll be right... No, no, come on in, come on in, I gotta get the phone. I'll be right with you. Yeah? What do you mean, "get out of here?" I'll be waiting for you, darling. There's this sweetest little piece of ass I've seen in six months and she's just dying for it, man. You want me to ice her? Mojo? Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit! Okay, this is gonna be tough. Why don't we knock her off after I pound her? All right, all right, all right. You owe me a blowjob! Don't you want to see my sample box? One minute, honey. All right, babe, you and I have some unfinished business to settle. Just so you don't get your hopes up. Let go of me! I'll let go of you. The boys told me to ice you right away, except I didn't think it would be too fair if you miss out on a chance of a little action with me. Lift your shirt. Just like in your movies. Shit! Sorry! Beat it, creep. Oh, I'm sorry. Thank you. You're welcome. No, no, really, I'm sorry. Oh but the pleasure was all mine. Hate to beat and run. Ugh. He's getting away, slut cake. Shit. Valid point. Shoes! The bushwater center. Shit. Honey, drink some more, it's good for you. I got him. I got another one. Two-bit scum Dean. All over some shopping mall. Now I gotta get the rest of them in one fell swoop. They know I'm looking for them. I'm gonna tell them where the locker is and then surprise them. How does that sound, love? Well, I gotta go get things ready. Sonja orloff. Who is this? You know who this is. What do you want? You win, I've decided it's time to sell. When and where? Meet me in the sepulveda yard at the ultimate storage co. Three o'clock this afternoon. But that's so soon. Yes, I know, that's soon. Wait, wait, let's talk about it. Darling, we want to be alone. What is it, Sonja? It was the girl. What did she say? The sepulveda yard. Shit. We wouldn't have been there for weeks. Exactly. When we blow the lock, she'll be uncomfortable close to the explosion. "A greedy daughter "killed trying to steal her father's secrets. Now while we have the room, the police will have nothing and the whole family will seem like a bunch of cranks. Very nicel almost an aerostatic impurity to the, how you say, scheme? Precisely. Sonja. Glasnost. A Russian word meaning "open it." Well, pardon me while I whip out my perestroika. All the time in the world. So, what we do now? You die. Very nicel very nice! Come on down here, young lady. You know, I admire your work tremendously. Fuck you, you'll never get into the room. Come on down, come on down and see the cheap rent-a-car Sonja got me. Shana, shana, my love. Oh, and I will get into the room too. You see, I have a key now and a little bit of plastic explosives for a shot I've got in mind a little bit later. So why don't you just kill me? Oh, I will, I will. But, you remember that commercial you auditioned for? The one I was working on? Why, you got the part! Yeah, but see, I need a realistic massacre scene and, well frankly, the stuff on TV is a little trite. I need something fresh. You mean the world's first snuff commercial? Yes! Yes! Good! Good! You understand! Come on, you fascist comrades! Let's go, enough conversation. You, start throwing this stuff out! Wait! You know, the colonel, he wouldn't move this junk every time we went to work. Just throw out the empty boxes! Here we go! This is more like it! This is what we were looking for. Wonderful! Nice. Now look what we have here. - Damn! - Is that? Do you have key? No, darling. Can't you see his hand is hurt? Robby, you bastard! You must, you two must have a lot to catch up on but I don't think you'll have time. Robby, get the explosives. Shana, here's your blocking. Three minute timer, small explosion. But you're tied to the couch. We come in later and we film the aftermath. We got a camera rolling right over there, gonna get the whole event. Any questions? Yeah. Do I get any residuals? Love you, kid. Robby? Let me see your face. I know it's you, so there's no point in the mask. I just want to see you again. You're very handsome, darling. I've missed you. Cool your jets, shana. I may have been fond of you once but so what? You're dead meat. We had some good times, didn't we? You're the only man I really loved, robby. - Well... - You don't have to lie. Who's lying? You're the best lover too. You filled me as no man ever has. Trying to turn me on? Maybe. Robby, there's something I want you to do for me. I want you once more before I go. Oh, shana. Just tell them you need to check the ropes. It's a three minute timer. You should be able to handle that. Don't say it unless you mean it. You must be horny from all that time in the hospital. Sonja and Roger getting it on all the time. Nothing for poor robby. I want it, robby. Just think, no birth control. Robby, slide my skirt up a little. Oh, your hand. Just think of sliding further, honey. I'm all warmed up for you, robby. Don't talk like that unless you mean it. Just tell them you need to check the ropes. Shana, are you ready? Ready as I'll ever be. Good. Is that your amputated finger in your pocket or are you just happy to see me? Aren't you gonna protect the camera? Oh, well, I'm touch by your concern but I'm going after that destroyed documentary camera quality. Sonja, flip the switch. You got it, boss. See you in the dream room. Robby? I hate method acting. I'm just gonna double check the ropes. Quickly, robby. Thank you, my love, for granting a horny maiden her last wish. You know me, I never could turn it down. I know. I know, love, I know. It would be so much nicer if I could hold you. Hal ha! You think I was gonna fall for that? You invited me for dinner and now I'm gonna eat and run. You know, this is nice. This is enough. Nice, baby. Real nice. But look at me when you're doing this. Oh, robby, you're being so rough. Yeah? Well this is the first time on this spy mission I haven't had to give a shit about what you think. This mission is over and now you're gonna get 10 inches of cold war! How's it feel to fuck someone who killed your whole family? I was the masked man both times. Don't be cruel. Don't lie. Oh, robby, you feel so good. That's what they tell me. Did you ever love me, robby? Never. Just like punching a clock. Thank you for doing this for me, robby. Oh, baby. Oh, baby! Easy, boy, easy. I don't have time for this. How much time? All the time in the world. So, when's your next assignment? I'm trying to focus, baby. Just tell me. Under covers again? When you talk to me you distract me! I'm sorry. Sorry, just curious. Oh, baby. Just tell me. Where are you stationed? If you don't mind, I got other things on my mind! Thanks, robby. Robby should've spoken to me first. You really should've spoken to me first, darling. Ugh, she used his body as a shield. Precisely. Sonjal take five. This is for mom, dad, ginger and a whole year with that scum sucker, robby. Come on, I'll give you anything that you want. Go eat lead! Are you coming? No. Staying here with my family. Where's your family? Trust me. I'll wait to give you a ride. Suit yourself. Did you ever have one of those dreams where you're dreaming while you're dreaming? When you can't wake up, you're dreaming wide awake. But when you wake up, everyone's out of sync. What do you think, shana? Dream room's not too shabby, huh? Yeah, dad, on the water underground. Shana? Shana?!
