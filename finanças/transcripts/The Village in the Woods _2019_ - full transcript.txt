[woman whimpering] [crying] [woman screaming] - [woman screaming] - [wind eerily blowing] [wind blowing] [car revving] [breaks squealing] [Nicky] Mmm, we must be here. So it should be up on the right. [car revving] There's that bloody sign again. We must have missed a turning. [car engine sputtering] [car revving] [car engine shutting off] For fuck's sake! [ominous music] - [car door opening] - [Nicky] Where are you going? [Jason] To try and get a bloody signal! Oh, come on. Are you kidding me? Come on! [woman screaming in distance] [phone beeping] [Nicky] What are we gonna do? [Jason sighing] [Jason] Sleep here. You're kidding me. There's no fuel, no signal now... First light we'll go. See if we can find a garage or something. - [wind lightly blowing] - [birds cawing] [yawning] [groaning] What time is it? It's sevenish. Oh, my back. That was a hard sleep. Did you sleep? No. It's too cold. I'm gonna find out where we are. There must be something nearby. What if you get lost? Don't wanna be stuck here forever, do you? You coming? Yeah. Don't forget that key. [bird cawing in distance] You're kidding me. [eerie music] Let's go. [birds cawing] [sign creaking] Wow, it's... Brilliant. I was gonna say a dump. Our dump. There's someone upstairs. Huh? There's someone up there. Gimme the key, babe. [knob rattling] Rebecca? Rebecca. Oh, we've been expecting you. My, my, my, haven't you changed. Oh, I'm Maddy. Jason. Pleased to meet you, Jason. What a beautiful ring. Wasn't it Kit's? Yeah. I remember her wearing it. Absolutely stunning. [Nicky] Cheers. We're just trying to get in. I thought I saw someone. Oh, Arthur. Moved in after his wife died. Place has never been the same. We've been trying to get rid of him ever since. Is there a garage around here? Why, have you broken down? Yeah, ran out of fuel. [Maddy] Petrol or diesel? Petrol. I think I can accommodate that. [Jason] Really? Yes. Come with me, come on. Come, come, come. [Jason] Thanks, that's very kind of you. [Maddy] Oh, there we go. One can of petrol. Take as much as you need. Thanks? Gosh, it is so very cold. Why don't you both come in and have a warm drink? I think we're best getting back to the car. Later maybe? Are you sure? You're both very welcome to come and have breakfast. Can we take a raincheck on that? Ah, of course you can. I'll tell you, you have no idea what it'll mean to see that pub back up and running again. Everyone will be so excited to meet you. Hmm. Tata. [Nicky] She's onto me. [Jason] No chance, as long as we stay out of trouble. [Charles] You must be Rebecca, if I'm not mistaken. I'm Charles. Oh, hi. And you must be...? Jason. [Charles chuckling] Oh, how very nice to meet you both. Your car the one in the woods? Yeah, we ran out of gas. Right, so you've got what you need? We best be going. Sure. See you soon. [Jason] Yeah, of course, we'll be back. Good. Good to hear. Stop acting like that. Like what? You're being really obvious. Just chill, okay? [car ignition firing] [Jason] For fuck's sake, come on! [car ignition firing] God! [growling] Fuck! [eerie music] Ugh! [Nicky] Where to now? Take this. What are we doing? [Jason] Going back to the pub. What? [Jason] Come on. Come on! [Rebecca huffing] [woman passionately moaning] - [man grunting] - [bed squeaking] [moaning and grunting continues] [creature growling] [eerie music] [Jason chuckling] What? I just heard her screwing. What? Seriously, I just heard her fucking and going hard at it like the clappers. No. [Jason laughing] Ugh. At her age? Who the hell with? Probably some young buck. Ugh. At least somebody's getting it. [door creaking] [ceiling thumping] [eerie music] We could use here. For what? For our stuff. Till we get him out. How exactly are we gonna get him out? Have you thought about that? Hello? Hello?! [Nicky] I'm not staying in here. You got any better ideas? Walk to the nearest town? [Jason] What town? You've seen where we are, come on, Nicky. You said this would be easy. It's a dump, who the hell is gonna buy it? The village is bloody dead. I want a home. I want a baby. I want to settle down. This place is our ticket to all that. [door banging] He has to go out sometime. You wait for him then. Nicky! [Maddy] Rebecca, I thought you might need these. Ah. Oh, I'm so sorry, is this a bad time? No, we just expected more and can't get in the flat. He's such an awkward old man. He's been the bane of this village for years. Just wanna speak to him. You should have knocked. I did, he didn't answer. No. [laughing] Earlier when you came over with the jerry can. I didn't want to disturb you. Oh, don't be silly. I wasn't too busy, was I, Charles? [Charles chuckling] Oh, I have an idea. Why don't you both come and stay at my place till Monday? Well I could do with some strong young hands around the place. Thanks, but I think we'd better stay here. Thanks for the offer, that was very kind of you. Do take the bedding, that's the least we can do to help you both. [Charles] Would it be rude if we have a look around? Oh, Charles. [Charles] It's a long time since I'd been inside. [Maddy] Charles has such fond memories of the old Harbour Inn. [sniffing] Ah, that smell. Reminds me of the old days when he wasn't here. She was a good woman, your aunt. So sad to see it like this. [eerie piano notes] In the old days, this place was full. Made the owner very rich, as it goes. Before all the hassle with him up there. [eerie music] I think we should let this fine young couple settle in, don't you? Yes. [chuckling] Of course. [eerie music] [bell tolling in distance] Let's just do what we agreed, okay? What if they know I'm not her and they call the police? They think you're her. They've been calling you Rebecca. What if the real Rebecca shows up? It's been 15 years since we left the town. 15 years. And I have nothing to show for it. It's nothing but rejection, just shit after shit. And more shit. Then this came along. We need this. With this money, there's no more dole queue, no more council estate, we can setup somewhere new, a fresh start. We just need to... sit it out. What about him? Won't be our problem anymore. In a few days we'll be out of here and if he says anything then we just play along like we own it. [tense music] Here's what you need. Okay. And make sure she wears this. Why? Because Rebecca wore it. Right. Not here. [deep booming] [whacking in distance] What are you doing? [Jason] Hi. That's mine, put it down. Okay. Just trying to you know, warm up, warm the place a bit. I'll pay you for it. I knocked earlier but you didn't answer. [Nicky] Jason? - Oh, Christ. - [tense music] Rebecca, my wife. So it begins. You chose the wrong place. [door slamming] We need to talk. We'll make you an offer. What did he mean? [wind howling] [fire crackling] [knocking] We thought you might be hungry and we brought some lanterns. [Jason] All right, yeah, come in. Oh, this is cozy. Vince. Jason. And this is my partner in crime, Emily. [Jason] And this is Rebecca. My, haven't we changed. I don't know what to say, but thank you. Not at all. Not much, but better than nothing. Whereas on the other hand, this is a vintage malt. Oh, why don't we ladies clean these up? Leave you boys to put the world to rights. Come along, dear. My memory isn't what it used to be but weren't you five or six last time we met? It was a long time ago. It was. Oh, let me see. Ooh, looks like some sort of irritation. What do you think, Emily? Oh it does, at that. How long have you been wearing the ring, dear? [Vince] We're dying of thirst here, ladies. [women laughing] Come on. [Emily] We're coming. The place hasn't changed a bit. [ceiling thumping] Old git. Barber, only bitter. [everyone laughing] Madam? Ooh, I thought you'd never ask. It really suits you behind there, doesn't it, Charles? It really does. [laughing] To the inn. Aye, to the inn. To the inn. You'll make wonderful landlords. It just feels so right, you being here. - [guests laughing] - [eerie music] So it begins. [Charles VO] I've been thinking about you and the time we'll share together. [Jason] Rebecca? You okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Just a bit tired. [guests laughing] [glasses clinking] - Thanks for coming. - Goodbye. [Emily] Bye. He knows. They're just a bunch of bored oldies. They're weird, yeah. All the same, just old. Something's not right. [Jason] Nicky, come on, babe. [kissing] [door slamming] [Nicky sighing] [fire crackling] [Nicky VO] Charles knows I'm not Rebecca. The way he stared at me at the bar. That old woman, Maddy, asking me questions. It's like they were playing games with us. I think they know what we're up to. Jason is so blind to it. The woman who set this up, she said nothing about another person living here. Something really isn't right about this. The woods, pub, and these people. I'm leaving tomorrow. I'm not gonna wait this out. If he loves me, he'll come. If he doesn't, then... ...it's over. [rhythmic creaking] [rhythmic creaking continues] [door creaking] [fire crackling] [deep droning music] [sighing] [clacking in distance] Jason? [light piano music] [tense music] [steps thumping] [Man] Nicky. - [crashing] - [Nicky gasping] - [Nicky] Jason! - [ominous music] Jason! Jason! Jason! Nicky! It's me! Open the door. Hey you, what's wrong? What's going on? [Nicky sobbing] Hey, it's okay. It's all right, come here. There's nothing there. [Maddy] Everything okay? [Nicky] There was something. There was this, Something? Something outside. [Maddy] Oh, it's probably a deer or a fox. They come down from the woods. Right. Well I still need to... don't leave. I'll wait. Easy to get spooked out here what with it being so dark. Yeah it is. She's a very, very lucky girl. Well, to have such a strong, young man to protect her. [eerie music] [toilet flushing] All better? Well, do let me know if you need anything. [lock clicking] What were you doing down there? What do you mean? With Maddy, what were you doing? I'm gonna go tomorrow. But what about the money? Fuck it. There was somebody out there, Jason. Oh, come on. Look at this place. Look at them, they're all weird! But we are so close. Close to what? The money. Why don't you see the way that they're looking at me? Why don't you see it? See what? I'm gonna go tomorrow. If you don't come with me, then, we're over. [bird squawking in distance] [clock ticking] [Maddy humming] [eerie music] [wood creaking] [clicking noise] [beast snarling] [music intensifying] [beast roaring] [breathing heavily] [mysterious music] [clicking noise] [clicking noise] [humming] [music swelling] [lightly tense music] [fire crackling] Try and warm the place up a bit. Come on. We'll leave later today. Really? Yeah, you're right. It's not what I thought. I thought this place would be something else but it's not. Thank God. [Maddy] Hello. I hope we're not too early. No, just having breakfast. Perfect timing. I thought you might need something to warm you up. Tea, Earl Gray. We realize you need some time to settle in, but we, the village, thought we might offer you a little welcoming party. Here. All right. You don't need to do a thing, we'll bring everything. It's a bit short notice. Oh, as a community we love to pull together. We thought, the sooner the better, how about this evening? We could rekindle the old atmosphere, have some drinks. Well you... Indeed. Oh, I almost forgot. I'll be at Charles' till lunchtime. If you need the place, it's all yours. Thanks. We'll call back later. [tense music] Thank God we're leaving. [key clinking] I wanna go as much as you do. But we need money. At the party, we could pick up a few things, they'd be none the wiser. You're not serious. We're broke, babe. Breakfast? Here you go. Drink up. Look at this. Looks really like Charles but it's such an old photo. I don't like the way he looks at me. It's seedy. What do you expect, you're beautiful. I'd stare at you if I had to screw her everyday. Is that what you're gonna think about me when I'm old? Oh, God, today. Where are you going? I'm going out. This place is making me ill. [door slamming] [birds squawking and chirping] Stay away. Why did you come here? You silly girl. I inherited the pub. Really? No one inherits the Harbour Inn. Your name is not really Rebecca, is it? Is it!? It is. They're all waiting, all watching. The villagers. They're gonna do something terrible. And you walked straight into it. - Look at your hand! - [ominous music] Oh my God. It's started. What is this? I can help you. Stay back. You can't run away! No one escapes. Hello? [door creaking] [ominous music] [eerie music] [low droning music] - [woman screaming] - [door creaking] [tense music] Nicky! What? He knows. Who? Look at my fucking hand. Who knows? Arthur. He knows I'm not Rebecca. You told him? He knew. Shit. Come on, let's get this off you, okay? It's not gonna come off, is it? It will. I will find you something, okay? God, I'm so tired. I need to go lie down for a minute. Fuck. I feel really weak. Babe. I wish we'd never come here. Yeah. I think we should go. Can you do it? Yeah I just need to get some sleep. What did Arthur say? He said we were in danger. Did he threaten us? He said it was them. He said it was him? Them, he said it was them. Did he say anything else? Nicky. [door creaking] [sobbing] [sobbing continues] [startling music] What do you want?! You still don't understand, do you? [Jason] Understand what? She played you. The way she played... now fuck off! [door slamming] [tense music intensifying] [Nicky] Mmm. Mhmm. Mmm. [sign creaking] [glass clinking] Friends. I'd like to take this opportunity to welcome the newest members of our community. Jason and Rebecca. You have no idea how important this moment is. The chance to rekindle what was. So, to Jason and Rebecca, thank you for bringing new life to our village. Jason and Rebecca. [Guests] Jason and Rebecca. [clacking on window] [scraping] [Maddy laughing] I'll be back. [tense music] [door clacking] Another one? Yeah, why not? To many more. To many more. Got quite a kick, this bubbly. What can I say? It was a good year. [Emily] How are you, my dear? Yeah. Weird. Don't worry. It won't last long. [eerie music] It's her. Everything okay? I won't be going out there tonight if I were you. Let go of me. Get off! Stop! [Nicky] Fuck off! Leave me alone. [wind howling] [champagne trickling] [guests laughing] [Charles] Welcome to our world. [guests laughing] [tense music] What? Everything's, out of my way. [Jason exclaiming] [Jason mumbling] What are you doing? Where's Nicky? [Jason mumbling] [music intensifying] Find her. [bird squawking in distance] Nicky, you'll never leave. Not like that. The ring. It's got to go. It's the only way. I can't get it off. [Arthur] It's got to go. No. If I don't, you'll have a worse fight. You gotta believe me. No, you're fucking mad. It's got you, it will take you. You'll be in a terrible place. You must cut the thing that binds you! [tense music] We have to do this now. They're coming. I have to cut it off. It's the only way. This way, come on, come on! Come on, this way, this way. Hold my hand, come on! Come on! [Vince] Nicky. Nicky. Nicky? Nicky. [tense music] Nicky. Nicky. [Arthur] Come on, Nicky. Come on. Nicky. [Arthur] Take my hand, that's it. Come on, that's it. Come on. Nicky. Just there. I wish I got to you before you came to Cooper's Cross. Nobody who comes here ever leaves. I searched for days for Anna. [Vince] Nicky. Nicky. I have no idea if this is going to work. But we've got to try. Shh. [Vince] Nicky! [tense music] Hey. Shit. [bashing] Bring him. [ominous music] Arthur. Arthur. [laughing] It's been such a pleasure watching you suffer. Remember, you came to the village of your own free will. Just like our new visitors Nicky and Jason. Devoured by greed and the promise of easy money. In truth, we lured you here. The deceiver deceived. Trapped by your own choice, you cannot leave. Tied to the fate of the ring. You murdered my Anna! [eerie music] Consider our disappointment when Anna couldn't give us what we wanted. Succumbed during the final act. Such a shame. Such a waste of our efforts. [laughing] To ensure our immortality, our seed must be passed to an infant born of a human. If not, we wither and die. The precious window of fertility comes but every 300 moons. And it has returned tonight. The perfect vessel, Nicky, strong and fertile, awaits. Intoxicated by the ring whose powerful drug courses through her veins. If she gives birth to this child, we shall celebrate. For it will feed our bloodline and determine our being. Then when the sixth hour falls on the sixth week, we shall drink its blood, consume its tender flesh and devour its heart, which will sustain our kind for the next hundred years. Sick fucks. [lighter clicking] Almighty Satter, oh great forefather, granter of immortality, we offer unto thee a sacrifice in the hope that tonight, we will plant a fertile seed and so ensure our longevity. The time is now. The demon is awake. We must satisfy the darkness within. [fire whooshing] [Arthur screaming] I do love a good fire. [fire crackling] Oh, look at her. She's so plain. I do think on such a very special occasion we should make an extra effort to help her look her best. You're right, shall I? Ah. Slowly, slowly. Carefully, carefully. Little monkey. [women laughing] Good job. Now I think we should check. Can I? Please. I really think you should leave this to me. Of course. After all, we wouldn't want your excitement leading to a more distracting, torturous moment. [Emily giggling] [tense music] [Emily] Well? [eerie music] She is a virgin. [laughing] How very good. [laughing] Shall we leave the ring? No. But wouldn't she be able to move? She will be paralyzed all the way from here down to here. [giggles maniacally] We must be able to see her eyes. [laughing] Ready? Indeed. [eerie music] [beast growling] [whimpering] [music slowly intensifying] [door creaking] [whimpering] [door slamming] [Nicky screaming and whimpering] - [clock ticking] - [Nicky whimpering] I think it's going to be a long night. Anyone fancy a drink? [Nicky screaming] [bell tolling] [sign creaking] [baby crying] [baby crying] - [creature growling] - [woman screaming] [tense music] [pensive music]
