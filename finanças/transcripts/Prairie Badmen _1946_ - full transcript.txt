Hiya, hiya, hiya, hiya, hiya, folks! Come on in. Gather round, gather round. Good news is about to come your way. Doc Lattimer's world-famous elixir will cure any known misery, and a lot of other things that you've never heard about, too. It's good for man or beast. Why, it'll even cure flat feet or falling hair, and it only costs you one dollar. Just imagine, folks, just imagine. You can become a new man for one lone, measly buck... I mean, dollar. Fuzzy seems to be all right on the crescendo, but he doesn't seem to have the proper persuasive note in his confidential appeal. Oh, stop worrying, dad. Everything's going to be all right. You just lie back and rest. Step right up a little closer and who is the first one to want one of these cure-alls? Why, ladies and gentlemen, you can even drink this famous elixir, or you can rub it on the outside. Now here's a scientific test for ya. Just rub some of this on one leg, then see if that leg don't step higher than the other one. Ha ha! Folks, you wouldn't believe me if I was to tell you the terrible dangers and hardships that doc Lattimer went through to gain the secret of this elixir, and bring his blessings to suffering. Gentlemen, I could go on telling you for hours the powers that are contained in this little bottle right here. But my time is running short. Hey, let's have a little fun. Get the rope. All right, step right up, folks, and lay your dollar on the line. Then go home and make your wife think she's got a new husband. And for you lady folks, vice-versy. All right, here it is, only one dollar. One dollar, step right up. Ain't got many left. Step right up, folks, here it is. [ Stammering ] Don't anybody want one? [ Crowd laughs ] Hey! Hey! Don hitched the horses. What happened? I don't know. Hold it! [ Men whooping ] Hey! Hey, wait for me! What's eatin' you? We're just havin' a little fun. I don't see anything to laugh at. Might be funny if you dragged that wagon back where you got it from. Never mind the wagon. Just get out of here. You heard what the man said. Get goin'. Okay, but I'll be seeing you again when you haven't got a gun in your hand. Go on! Howdy. I hope you folks didn't get hurt. We're all right, thanks to you. It's impossible for US to express our gratitude. Don't lose any sleep over that. Where are your horses? They're in town. My son Don will bring them. You know, I've seen that old coot somewhere, but I can't place him. Who cares about that old coot? It was that girl that took my eye. That gun in that stranger's hand took my eye. That's the only thing I was lookin' at. [ Panting ] Fuzzy, you pop up in the doggonedest places. Billy. What are you made up for? Oh, haven't you heard? I'm dishin' out blessings of mankind. I'm sellin' a famous kickapoo elixir. Yeah? What do you know about medicine? Nothing much, but I'm sellin' it. Fuzzy has been a real friend. Dad was taken ill, and we were desperate. We didn't know what to do. Fuzzy offered to help out for a while. You don't know the trouble fuzzy's helpin' gets you into, ma'am. I was watering the horses. What happened? Some barroom sports thought they'd have a little fun. This gentleman set them back on their heels. This is my brother Don, mister...? Carson. Bill Carson. Glad to know ya.Same here. And i'm Linda Lattimer. We'd love to have you travel with US to the next town. Oh, we travel too slow for him. He's always in a hurry to go someplace. I don't happen to be in a hurry right now, fuzz. I'd enjoy having company, ma'am. That's fine. I'm glad you can join US for a while. Don, hitch up the team, and we'll get started. Excuse me. I'll see if dad wants anything. Hey, how come you're not in a hurry all of a sudden? You wouldn't happen to be jealous, would you, you old goat? And by the way, seems like you should know something about the stuff you pass out to people. What's the difference? That won't hurt anybody, and this stuff don't do anybody any harm. Yeah? How do you know? Look. I'll prove it to you. Look here. You can put it on your hair, or you can rub it down your back, or you can even drink it. [ Yells ] What's the matter? What happened to him? He, uh... He's practicing a new war dance. Oh. That's all right. That should attract a crowd. But how does he expect to sell any elixir if he runs away at the finish? He's gonna figure that out later. That's just... He's demonstrating the power of the elixir. ♪ The campfire's light ♪ brightens up the night ♪ and the prairie's goin' to rest ♪ ♪ down that lonely trail ♪ there's a coyote's wail ♪ to his mate out in the west ♪ ♪ while the night is waning... ♪ How's your pa?

I want a chance to get my hands on some real money. That's not a good idea to be in too much of a hurry about that. You got a lot of time ahead of you. Sure. But who wants to waste a lot of time? You know, I... I've been figurin' on gettin' married. T'ain't no fittin' life for a fella to be roamin' around by himself all the time. I can go buy a nice little piece of land, build a home on it.

It's good for man or beast. Why, it'll even cure falling feet or falling hair. And it just sells for one dollar a bottle, gentlemen. Think of that. Now, stop and think. You can become a new man for just one measly dollar. Ha ha ha! That's him-- I'll bet $1,000. You could be wrong. Yeah, and I could be the king of siam. My friends, the secret of this marvelous elixir has been handed down from father to son for unknown generations. Years ago, I learned of the miraculous cures made by an old kickapoo medicine man. I didn't believe those stories until I saw the proof with my own eyes. I can't tell you how I gained that secret. That is a secret confidence. But I can offer to you this marvelous blessing to suffering mankind. [ Coughs ] All right, folks, all right. Step right up. It's only one dollar a bottle. One dollar. Who wants to take a bottle? Here you go, sir. Something you'll never regret. You'll always be glad. Here you are, little lady. Hey, I think I'll get me a bottle of that. I've had a little touch of rheumatism here, lately. Remind me sometime to sell you a nice, gold brick I've been savin' for someone just like you. Ha ha ha! Uh, pardon me, son. I see you work with this outfit. Have you known old doc Lattimer long? Yeah, quite a while. He happens to be my father. Ho! Then you should be pretty well acquainted. Want a little drink? Thanks. I don't mind if I do. Just a minute, mister. I've got a bone to pick with you. I'm gonna learn you to mind your own business. Who wants a big bottle? [ All talking at once ] One for the man behind the bush. What happened? Billy Carson started a fight. Fuzzy jumped in, and we lost the crowd. Ha ha ha ha! Why should they do that? I don't know why, but I'm certainly gonna tell them what I think about it. Somebody put out the lights. Gimme! Gimme! Billy! Billy! Take it easy. Now that you learned me my business, suppose you go about your own? That was the meanest trick anybody ever played on me. What are you talkin' about? You know very well what I mean. I suppose you thought it was funny to start a brawl and steal the crowd away from US. And I thought I could count on you as a friend. I never dreamed you'd take part in a mean trick like that. Well, I... We'll manage to get along without your help from now on. Give me that costume. Hey, wait a minute. I haven't got anything else on. You're through as of now. See what you've done? Yeah? What did I do? I don't know, but you done somethin' to get me in bad. You're a hoodoo. Ha ha ha! Your friends ran into a little trouble. They've gone on down the road. What kind of trouble? Educational. They offered to teach me to mind my own business. You might be smart if you'd learn that lesson. What did he wanna know? Nothin' particular. We just had a sociable drink. What'd he talk about? I think you should learn to mind your own business. Listen, son, I'll turn you over my knee and give you a spankin'. Well, he talked about dad. Wanted to know if he was in this part of the country five years ago. Yeah? Was he? I don't think so. That was before he had this kickapoo outfit. Linda and I weren't with him then. We can do no good in this town now. Let's get started. What's the matter with her? Ah, I guess she's mad at me and Billy because a rumpus started and folks lost interest in the elixir. Fuzz. Hmm? I'm worried about that outfit. I'm afraid they're in for some serious trouble. Why don't you go tell 'em? I don't think they'd pay much attention. All I've got to go on is a hunch. We ain't what you'd call exactly popular. All right, pull up. Linda: Why did you stop US? I want to have a talk with doc Lattimer where we won't be disturbed. You can't talk to my father. He's not well. I think he'll talk, all right. Either call him, or I'll go in and get him. If this is a hold-up, this is all the money we have. Take it and let US be on our way. I'm not interested in that chickenfeed. What I want are the four bars of gold that bill Thompson took from the express office five years ago. I don't know anything about that. Don't tell me that. Bill made a map of where he hid the gold. You were the last one to see him alive. The map wasn't on his body when the sheriff found him. You didn't dig it up, doc, or you wouldn't be playin' around with this tinhorn outfit. I tell you, I don't know what you're talking about. Then you'd better start doin' a little rememberin'. I had the right hunch, fuzz. Let's take 'em. Wait a minute. We gotta avoid shooting. Here's what I want you to do. I'll go around this side. You'd better start thinkin' fast, because I'm not gonna stick around here all day. This is your last chance, doc. What do you say? All right. You win. [ Fuzzy laughing ] [ Drunken muttering ] Whoa, horse! Whoa! Whoa! Hey! Ha ha! Did you come all the way out here to get some of this elixir? It's wonderful stuff. It's wonderful. Look what it's done for me. I ain't half the man I am now till I started drinkin' it. Get off of me, or I'll break every bone in your body! Wait till things stop goin' round. Don't be too rough on him, Cal. I think maybe he's fond of you. Cal: Get this drunk off me! Hit him over the head with something! You boys havin' fun? Let's not bother these folks any longer. I think they'd like to be on their way. You certainly go out of your way to look for trouble. It could be, but I haven't found any yet that bothered me. I wouldn't trail this outfit any further. The next time you show up, it won't all be in fun. Now get goin'. And thanks for the gun. I think I'll keep it as a souvenir. I hope you can forgive me. I'm so ashamed. That's all right. I'd sure like to know what those fellas had in mind. Doc, why were they so interested in knowing whether or not you were in this country five years ago? Dad, I think we should know the whole story. Yes, you're involved, and you have a right to know what it's all about. You children were living with your aunt five years ago, going to school. I wasn't doing very well in a small mining camp as a doctor, when one night, a fatally wounded man staggered into my office. You're in pretty bad shape. Wait a minute, doc. I know I'm finished. You're a pretty good scout, willin' to help me. I want to do something for you. That map will show you where I buried four bars of gold bullion. Don't send it by express. It might look familiar to 'em. You've got a pretty good chance. You might pull through. I'm layin' the odds, doc. I told ya. [ Knock on door ] Hello, sheriff. Hi, doc. Looks like bill Thompson's horse outside. That looks like bill Thompson himself. When a man comes to me for help, I don't ask him his name. Save US the trouble of hangin' him. He's dead. What did he do? Robbed the express company of a gold shipment. They've got him, but no gold. I'll send somebody over tomorrow and pick up the body. Good night, sheriff. So long, doc. I left town the next day, intending to go after the gold, but I found I couldn't go through with it. I couldn't use that wealth, but I didn't have the moral courage to return it to the express company. As far as I know, the gold is still where Thompson buried it. Do you have that map, doc? Yes, I have it. Then we'll find the gold, and return it to the express company. You're crazy! They lost the gold. Why should we hand it back to 'em? If we had that money, we could get a start in life. Then we could amount to something. Maybe you like it, but I'm fed up with trailing around the country with a two-bit medicine show. But, Don, that isn't our money. We haven't any right to keep it. Why not? We don't owe the express company anything. That gold could stay buried where it is for the next 5,000 years, and it wouldn't do anybody any good. I know I'm right. Tell him there isn't anything else for US to do. I have nothing to do with it, miss Linda. It's something for you folks to decide. Dad, we must return that gold to the express company. It will be on our conscience until we do. We could never make any use of it. It would be the same as if we stole it. Yes, you're right. I've been wanting to do that for the last five years. I'm glad you feel that way. You can count on Billy and me helpin' you see it through. Maybe they want to get their hands on it, after we dig it up. Wait a minute, wait a minute. No little whelp can talk to me like that. I'll pin his ears back. Oh, he didn't mean that. He's only angry and disappointed. Please forgive him. I won't hold a grudge if you don't want me to. They're not gonna get away with that. We're gonna make him cough up that dough. Yeah, but before we try it again, there's a couple of guys we've got to get rid of. We'll take care of them, too. Ah, cheer up, Don. You were wrong. Be a sport about it. Well, another day behind US. Yes, we're nearly there. I'm glad we didn't have any further trouble. Yeah. Looks like those fellas gave up. I'm not countin' on it. Aahhh! Ha ha ha ha! Oh, fuzzy, I'm terribly sorry. Oh, that's all right. It just kind of surprised me a little bit. Smells like you scorched your surprise, fuzz. Hey, why don't you do me a favor, and play dead, will you? Don, come and get it. Thompson hung out in this country. I'll bet we're pretty close to what we're after. I don't see that we're any closer to getting rid of the two guys that messed things up for US. We'll take care of them tonight. I have an idea we'd better keep a pretty good watch from now on. Hey, fuzz. Maybe you'd better bed down in your hammock. Then you'd fall out every time you went to sleep. Ha ha ha! Don acts as if we were stealing something from him. I don't like it. He's acting like a spoiled brat. But he'll get over it. [ Snoring loudly ] [ Snoring continues ] [ Muttering ] Will you stop snorin' so I can get some sleep? Who's snorin'? I been wide awake all the time. Yeah, maybe you were. I don't see how anybody could get any sleep with all the racket you were makin'. [ Snoring resumes ] I wonder why he's sneakin' away like that. Do you suppose he's figurin' on double-crossin' the others? He could be. Maybe we'd better trail him. What about them other two fellas? We'll take care of them later. Maybe this is our lucky break. Hey! No, it's me! What's the matter? I heard a horse. I don't hear anything. I don't know, but I'm sure I heard a horse. It's probably one of your nightmares headin' this way. Well, you roll in, fuzz. I'll stand guard for a while. Might as well be comfortable while you're sleeping. Who's been asleep? I been wide awake all the...All the time. You won't need a gun to protect yourself from me. Guess I'm a little jumpy. You know, I can't help feeling we're gonna run into a lot of trouble before we get that gold back where it belongs. And it isn't really your trouble. You've taken our worries on your shoulders. I want you to know how very grateful we are. Ah, it's all right. Didn't have anything else to do, anyway. Hmm. Nobody ever bothered to stay up and keep me company. Ooh! Don. Come on, wake up. Billy! Billy, Don isn't here. Oh! Oh! Oh! He piled up that stuff to make US believe he was there all the time. Dad, Don has run out on US. Are you sure? Yes, sir. One of the horses are gone. He's stolen the map. It's hard to believe that a boy of mine would do a thing like that. I could break his neck. I know that map by heart. And I have a pretty good general idea of where he's headed for. Will you go after him? Yeah, we'll go after him. And, doc, I wouldn't take it too hard. You know, it's a big temptation for a young, discontented kid, and you don't know he's not gonna turn out all right when the final showdown comes. Hey, fuzz. Get your boot on. We got some hard ridin' to do. How come? Don stole the map. He's after the gold bullion on his own. Why, that little whelp! I'll get him. I'll show him what to do. [ Muttering ] I'll gamble he's leading US right where we want to go. We'll have to thank him for being so obliging. You take your time. We'll be movin' pretty fast. And Linda, don't you worry about nothin'. I'm takin' care of everything. I think he saw US. Well, what's the difference? We're at the end of the line. Maybe so. That's far enough. Who are you, and what do you want? All right, kid, let's have a talk. We can't find the gold bullion without your help, and you can't get away with it if we don't let you. Now, what do you say? Okay, I'll give you half. We'll split four ways. I get half, or it's no deal. All right, it's half. All right, kid, where is it? The way I read the map, it's hidden somewhere in this shack around the fireplace. Well, let's go get it. You boys satisfied with half? Half is better than nothin'. Let's go. Let's start tearin' this fireplace apart. Whew! I never thought I'd act like a gopher, but half of that gold is worth workin' for. You're tellin' me? Half of that bullion is worth a lot of money. What are you gonna do with your half of the gold, son? I won't have any trouble spreadin' it around. All: Ha ha ha! Hey! Take him inside. What's the idea? Don't you want your half of the gold, or maybe it ain't where you said it was. I told you I wasn't sure. You better start makin' sure quick. Now where is it? If it isn't in there, I don't know where it is. Get up. Hey, wait a minute, fuzz. Something wrong. Four horses. Don must be in there. There's Linda's horse. I didn't know we were coming to a party. Maybe we'd better look it over-- see if we're welcome. Come on. Now you start remembering. I thought it's where I told you. It's been a long time. Maybe somebody else got it. Don't give me that. Now you tell me the truth, or I'll beat you to a pulp. Have you got the map on you? No. I only saw it once. I tried to memorize it. It's gonna be tough on you if you didn't do a good job of memorizing. Get some ropes. Tie him up. I'll make him remember. Hey, I heard somethin' out there in the brush. Must be an animal of some kind. Coyote maybe. Yeah. I'll get rid of him. Oh! Your head sounded hollow, like a pumpkin. This looks like it might turn out to be a pretty rough party, fuzz. Yeah. Now you listen to me. You wouldn't have sneaked up here if you hadn't known where that gold's hid. Now tell US where it is. I told you everything I know. You're lyin'! If you care anything about livin', you'd better start talkin' fast. Let me think about it. Maybe I can remember. They've treated Don pretty rough. Fuzz, it wouldn't do any good to start a gunfight. He might get killed. Say, I've got an idea. Don't ask me to play a drunk. They won't hold still for that again. No, stampede the horses. That'll bring 'em out. Now go on. That's good. Yah! Go! Something's happened to the horses! So you're hittin' me on the head with a rock, huh? Keep your eye on 'em, fuzz. You bet I will. Come on, get up. Now that we're here, we'll pick up that gold bullion. Why should I give it to you? Why? Because we saved your life. Your dad wants it to go back where it belongs. Ah, you're right. I was wrong all the time. I'll get the map. I hid it when I thought I was bein' trailed. You're a good boy, Don. I don't think you three have committed any crime the sheriff would be interested in. You can walk back to town. You won't be botherin' US anymore. Hey, just a minute. Hey, do you mind if I toss a rock at those coyotes? No, fuzz. Go right ahead. All right, get runnin', you. Ha ha! Well, that's the way... Hey, Billy! Hey, the fight's over. Hey! Come on. Well, they gave US a very substantial reward for the return of the bullion. That's fine, doc. I wish you'd take half of it. No, you'd better keep it. You know, it'd ruin fuzzy to have money. Couldn't get a hat to fit him. Billy Carson, you're a very nice person. I bet you say that to all the boys. She ain't never said it to me yet. Fuzzy, you're a dear. Bye.bye. Bye, boys.
