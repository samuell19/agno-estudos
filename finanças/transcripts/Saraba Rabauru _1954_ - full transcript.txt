We would like to thank the Far East Command... of the American Air Force for providing... copies of their archival air battle footage for this film. TOHO PRESENTS FAREWELL RABAUL THE LAST FIGHTER JET Produced by Tomoyuki Tanaka Written by Takeshi Kimura, Dai Nishijima, Shinobu Hashimoto Photographed by Kazuo Yamada Music by Tetsuo Tsukahara Special Effects by Eiji Tsuburaya, Akira Watanabe, Hiroshi Koyama Starring Ryo Ikebe Mariko Okada Rentaro Mikuni Akihiko Hirata Akemi Negishi Chieko Nakakita Directed by Ishiro Honda Yeah! Hayama. Wakabayashi! We may die tomorrow. Let them enjoy. Don't be such a boor! Noguchi. Noguchi! Oni! Oni! (Devil) Kim! Dance! Kim! Dance! Let's drink! Three months ago I said the same thing to Wakabayashi. Three months ago. A pilot's eyes are his life. Playing all night before an attack, or a binge... are strictly forbidden. Sleep punctually. But what's the use at this moment? Hey! Correspondent! What are you going to write about our days here in Rabaul? There's nothing to write about. Go back to Japan. Go back to Japan? Are they... making planes for us back home? Tell them about Rabaul! My Katase team members! Without my order, no one leaves! Drink! Drink till you drop! Kim! Dance! Dance! You, of all people, should be calm. OK! Sit down. Drink. Stop it! This is not the time to dance! We're alive tonight, but we may die tomorrow in the southern skies! Keep on drinking. CAPTAIN WAKABAYASHI ACE PILOT OF RABAUL Oni. Hate! Kim hates him a lot. From this picture it's hard to get how he'd have this nickname. It's not up to you to comment. You're head over heels with Katase. Wake up! Do I look like it? Lousy reporter! Not just Captain Katase. All navy pilots are my sweethearts. When they go up, not everyone can make it back. Yuck! 13 planes! So unlucky! I think 30 set off this morning. I have a feeling he won't make it back. Captain Oni! The leading plane, No. 333. Captain. What a battle! Katase. Katase! You too, Yada? Sorry, Captain! Sorry. Lieutenant Hayama is missing! I know. Don't stand here! Send some rescue planes! - It's useless. - He's still alive! Useless! At 0850 above Kolombangara, Wakabayashi team... runs into 150 American P38 fighters. We shot down 16, and hit more than 10. Our team lost 16 men, 1 missing. Hayama is missing, 4 wounded. Captain Katase and Pilot Yada are severely hurt. Any chance of finding the missing? No. No? Yes! - Noguchi! - I confirm Hayama is just missing. Location is a reef 30 miles off the southeast of Bougainville. - Send a plane! - Noguchi! That's enemy territory. We might lose some more men. HAYAMA Pilots for tomorrow's attack. Captain! Hayama and I have been flying together since we joined. We're together all along. So... He'll be replaced. This ward. Congratulations, Shimada. You're discharged. Yes! Thank you so much! Your captain is here. - Captain Wakabayashi? - Yes. He's a good captain. Treasure of the navy. Ace pilot. 49 planes? 2 more today. That makes it 51. And you? One unconfirmed. From now on, I'll be as good as Captain... That song lyric, "I'll be this big tree!"? But your record... proves how good you are. Really? Yes! Training... and training. To perfect my skills, and win the war! The captain said so? Yes. It's true, Nurse Komatsu. Without much talk, he proves it by his flying! So, be like him as soon as possible, Mr. Shimada. Yada! Captain Katase got hit too. The enemy have so many planes! Be careful. I'll be OK. I'll let them have it! I see. If it's one on one, we won't lose. I know that. But I saw their supply fleet today. 150... No, 200 ships. Our torpedoes can sink 20 or 30 at most. Their supplies are overwhelming. Injection. Thanks. A plane? We shot one down, there's another. No, many many more. I'm so tired. Nonsense. Our Zero fighters were the world's best, right? But no more after Midway. Compared to Zero, Grumman F6F is much better. The Yamato Spirit isn't our monopoly. They're brave too. They made excellent planes like the Yellow Snake. Shut up. You're a defeatist! Absolutely not! I saw reality with my own eyes! We must... This is not up to us. Let the HQ think... Enough! He needs rest. Katase. From now on, only think of getting well as soon as possible. That's all. Coming in! I'm Pilot Shimada, now returning to the team! Oh. Come in. Yes. Captain. It was very sad in the barracks. No way! No way! Too gloomy. They're depressed! Shimada. Have spirit! Yes! Salute! Sub-lieutenant Yoshida and 5 pilots report for duty. Thanks. - Wait for orders. - Yes! Salute! Sergeant Kono. - Just 6? - Should be 12. 6 were shot down. What are you looking at? How beautiful. Impossible to believe that this is a battlefield. He won't be back, I guess. The most dangerous enemy is the Yellow Snake. Today they hit us real hard. You can tell it from the yellow snake on its body. Got it? Its tactic... is to wait until you fly down from above it, shoot your fuel tank, then goes down at once. What? Lieutenant Noguchi... Don't! This is stupid! - I must find Hayama! - Stop! Noguchi! Noguchi! Captain Sugai. Captain Sugai. This is HQ. Do you copy? Do you copy? Please answer. Captain Sugai. Captain Sugai. This is Wakabayashi. Sugai is dead. Wakabayashi. Captain Wakabayashi? This is HQ. Captain Wakabayashi, please answer. I'm taking over Sugai's command? I'm now in command. 0825. Now coming back. What is it, Shimada? My fuel tank was hit! Switch to fuel cork! OK! It's done! Steering OK? Yes. Follow me! I'll show you what to do! It's no use! Goodbye! Steer up! Captain! Goodbye... You're losing speed! Captain, sorry! Switch to the propeller pitch! Goodbye! Close the cowling! Captain, goodbye! Nonsense! Don't give up! Open up the lever! Shimada! Shimada! Come in. How did it go today? Even Captain Sugai was shot down by Yellow Snake? Every day... trouble every day. I just visited Captain Katase. He has also become pessimistic. If this goes on, what would Rabaul become? When did you start working at the HQ? Not just you. Everybody is speaking like they were HQ commanders. Worrying won't win the war. What we front line soldiers can do, is shoot down... as many planes as possible. That's all. The only road to victory. - Come in, all of you. - Yes! Coming in. Salute! Any one of you knows why Captain Sugai died? Look. - Sub-lieutenant Yoshida. - Yes! Listen. I ordered you to fly from here. So the enemy that's after Sugai, this, this, and this... would be trapped by you. Why didn't you follow my order? I copied you, but I... couldn't find the enemy. What? It's true. I couldn't tell our planes from the enemy's. And I can't remember what I did. Inadequate training. Yes. How did they train you in Japan? I know it's impossible to spend a year or two to train you. I have 10 years of experience... 10. The Yellow Snake that got Sugai, must have been very well trained. You must be thinking, "We don't have much time". But don't think like that. Not just flying a plane, any skill has to be trained. Even using chopsticks. You must achieve in 6 months what has been done in 5 years. No, master your skills in 3 months. If you can't, Japan will lose the war. RABAUL MILITARY POST OFFICE You're home. Kim is so happy. Her boyfriend made it back. Sending money back home again? Good girl. I have nowhere to spend my money here. They're all dead. Yes, in their planes. Some, like Captain Oni, are still alive. This is Major Onishi. He shot down 73 planes since 1937. But also dead. If the war goes on, Wakabayashi would be the same. Over! Americans... before Christmas... come to Rabaul. American... radio... said so. Understand? Don't... fly. Together... run away. Both... run away. You... want to die? You... don't want to live? I want to. No one wants to die. Then... why not run? Noguchi. Tell me frankly. You don't mind dying? We don't! Wow. Just by dying, the war won't be won. Captain, we... Listen. From my experience, 100 bullets won't hit you if you're not to be hit. But if you are, just one will do. So I just think about whether... I'll complete my mission and not if I'll live or die. Don't mind dying... means you're still worried if you'll live or die. Think about... completing your mission. That's the only road to victory. Yes! Please wait, I'll get her. This is my experience, my line of... thinking. How's Katase? It's not really serious. What's wrong with Katase? He has something to tell her. Please wait, I'll go change... No need. Women are staying put. Tell Katase that. Do it. Yes. Oni! Strange. When did she leave? I didn't ask. - A visit. - Yes. Thanks. Oh. Don't blame her. Right? Take this. Thanks. Captain Oni's order. - Wakabayashi? - Right. "Just tell him she's still here!" Like that. No wonder he has that nickname. That guy! He treats you like a real friend. But he's stubborn. A pilot shouldn't be distracted by women. I've been having strange thoughts. Sorry about that. Captain Oni is human after all. Right. He's purer and more upright than me. A man like him, even if he's madly in love with someone, would die without telling her so. Poor fellow. You may start. - How's he doing? - Good. He's been well nourished. Where to start? Ask him about his views of Zero. At first, Zero and its pilots... gave us a lot of fright. But we overcame our fears. Behind its advantages, its huge defects became clear to us. With 1,000 horsepower, Zero... is just the world's lightest passenger plane. It is a good weapon but totally indefensible. Unless that excellent Commander Oni is flying, we can easily shoot down these indefensible planes one by one. How long have you been flying? Ask him how long has been flying. He volunteered when the war broke out. That early? He's a refrigerator salesman. - Beer! - Yes! Beer! Come over! Coming! Sit down. Sit down. You stayed and heard more about Yellow Snake? Tell me. I don't want to lie. Everybody lies. Let's go upstairs. Now tell me all about it. Yellow Snake. He said, he couldn't understand why our pilots don't have parachutes. Japan's tactics, strategy and weapons, even military thought, are based on treating human lives lightly. Regarding your question, he said, "Zero is an awesome weapon in very able hands." "But it's very dangerous to unskilled pilots." Also, "Your exceptional pilots are very limited." "Yet, we also have enough of those." "It's very easy to shoot down your unskilled pilots in one-to-one." "We'll win this war very soon." "A country that regards human lives cheaply..." "won't win." "Let me say it again." "We'll win this war very soon." Finally he said, "Although we're enemies," "I respect Commander Oni a lot," that is you, Captain Wakabayshi. When I said, that's Commander Oni, he was so glad and wanted to shake your hand. Bad pilots got shot down. They didn't pay attention when they trained. I object! Using a fighter plane to bomb? Stupid! They can't keep up making bombers. This is the only alternative. To have a fighter carry heavy bombs and attack a carrier, it's suicide! We know it's hard. But the situation is very difficult, and you know it. To find a possible way out of an impossible situation, is our mission. Wakabayashi, you know Zero best. tell me what you think. I thought you'll be the first to agree. Please work on it at once. BOMBING WITH ZEROES Leave. Captain. Please! Mission always comes first. Wasn't it you who trained us to achieve that? It's now the time to overlook death and fulfill the mission! Tactics would allow that. Leave. I'm tired of killing snakes. Please let us sacrifice ourselves for carriers! It's easier to die as soon as possible. Too easy. Leave. He had an injection. He'll sleep for a while Lieutenant Noguchi! Let's go back. - No! - Yes! I'm not going! Tomorrow you'll subbing for Wakabayashi as captain, right? What? Me subbing for Wakabayashi. I'm a human being! Not a devil! OK. OK. Let's go. Lieutenant Noguchi. Kim! Kim. Come. Sub-lieutenant Yoshida. - I'm a human being! - Yes! I know! What? You really know that? - Yes! - I'm a human being. Yellow Snake... Yellow Snake! Lieutenant Thomas Hain was sent to a POW camp. He really wanted to meet you, Captain Wakabayashi. Bye. Take care of him. Yellow Snake. Yellow Snake. Shot down by Yellow Snake. We'll all get shot down by Yellow Snake! It's war. It's war! Why do we keep on killing each other? Wakabayashi, why do you... Katase! Katase! Why all this bloodshed? The Earth... all soaked in blood! Stop it! Enough! Wakabayshi! Enough. So cruel! Wakabayshi. Hills of corpses! Sea of blood! Wakabayashi. We lost 6 planes. 1 missing. It was Lieutenant Noguchi. I, Sub-lieutenant Yoshida, took over his command. Any chance of finding him? No. Where did he go missing? 20 knots SSE off Cape Merkus. Controlled by enemy forces. Really? Oh. So no chance of rescue. Right. Yoshida. There's really no chance to rescue him? Yes! - 20 knots SSE off Cape Merkus? - Yes! - Correct? - Yes! Noguchi! Noguchi! Noguchi! Hey! Captain. Good. Captain, just leave me here. Noguchi. Wakabayashi, Wakabayashi. Do you copy? Wakabayshi, the weather's getting worse. Hurry! Bastards! They're coming after me. Captain, are we being attacked? Just drop me! Noguchi! It's OK! Don't worry! Captain. I'll fly into that cloud. Wakabayashi. Do you copy? Make a 120-degree turn. Turn away from the storm. Rabaul's sky is clear. Make a turn now! 120 degrees. 120 degrees. No fuel for that. I'll go through the storm to Rabaul. I got Noguchi but he's badly wounded. Get an ambulance ready. Tell the hospital to send an ambulance. Yes. Noguchi. Hold on! Kiyokawa! Stop that! - And now? - It's about time. Noguchi. Almost there! It's here! It's here. Is the landing gear out? Good. Obstacles on the runway? Good. And the flap? Yes. The wheels? Maybe flat. Just land carefully. Such a precious plane. Don't crash it. Captain. Careful. Hold him. - I'm OK. - Medic! I'm OK. Noguchi! Noguchi! Hold his head. His jacket. Hurry... cut it open. Press his wrist. Noguchi! Are you OK? Noguchi! Noguchi! Noguchi! Noguchi! Noguchi. Noguchi! Noguchi. Live! Live, Noguchi! Live... "Wakabayashi isn't a devil." "Give him this and thank him", she said. I wish I knew then. It was 10 last night, I think. The corpse wasn't found? She threw herself into the volcano. I don't know why. I didn't realize she loved him that much. Hang it here? Yes. War. A native girl fell in love with a Japanese soldier, and followed him to death. Perhaps Noguchi did love her too. And you? Anyone? No. Or I wouldn't come here. But, I'll meet my true love. I refuse to give up that hope. Right? All women want that, right? That's a woman's happiness. 3,000 planes in a month. If they can use this island as a runway, it'd be 1 to 20. How about our new planes? Oh. Uncle Sam is early today. This way. Here. Ms. Miyazaki, I'm calling them. Ringer's Solution! Katase. Katase! He isn't here? Katase! Captain! Katase! Captain Wakabayashi! You go back! Katase! Here! Here! Stop! Enough! Get down! Captain Katase! What use is this war do to humans? It's up to historians in 100 years to decide. Even if this war is wrong, I'll still declare my faith in mankind loudly. Mankind of the future. The Japanese people. Be happy. Is that all? Yes. What are you looking at? Stars. Oh. You can see them from here? You can't. We had... training to see things small and far, so we can see stars at day time. That coconut tree above the hill. There. It's Escamilio. 60,000 light years. Sometimes while I look at the stars, I realize how stupid we are on this tiny Earth. Even with a long life, we can only live 100 years. But, the reality is getting harsher and harsher. The Rabaul women were all evacuated? You've heard? Yes. When the supply ships arrive, we nurses will go back to Japan. If you have time, go visit Katase's folks. They'll be happy to see someone who took care of him. Yes. Coming in! We're here to fetch you. - Fetch me? - Yes? Our planes are to be evacuated to Truk Islands. We'll leave in 2 hours. Oh. The pilots are to be picked up by freight planes. You're ordered to go back to your team and wait for orders. OK. Oh my. The navy flying team is to leave Rabaul. Japan is finished. Do you think this is OK? The enemy's bombing us hard, but... but! Ms. Komatsu, please pack my things. - I'll talk to the hospital head. - Yes. Captain. So... you'll take the next plane with me? Nonsense! I'll be on board too. They take us away, so things aren't good. We have to give here up. Bad things don't come alone. During last night's air raid, the Yellow Snake POW ran away. Yellow Snake? Yellow Snake. Rabaul without planes. I should die soon. Yoshida. Don't rush to die. Try to survive. Farewell Rabaul, until we meet again. My tears keep running down. The lovely coral islands, the cross star and the coconut trees. That girl says, "Now that's a real man!" I place my love in my plane's wings. Tomorrow I'll be flying... somewhere up the skies. What are you doing? Captain, isn't it a disgrace for the navy air force... if there's no plane in Rabaul? More. More. Some more. Toss him up! Wait! Sounds like our Betty G4M1. A freight plane to take us away. Sergeant Ishikawa is not on the list? Low-rank troops aren't listed. It's time to say goodbye. I prepared that for you. But no use now. We leave at 1600. I'll fly the test run. That's OK. I've asked Sub-lieutenant Yoshida. Please deliver this for me. You'll go back to Japan? The Rabaul crew all chipped in. 857.2 yen in total. You too, have nowhere to spend your money? What a waste. Give this to the workers making new planes. Buy them drinks and cheer them up. A phone call for you. This phone. Is it Captain Wakabayashi? Speaking. I'm Sumiko Komatsu. Yes. Thanks for everything. What? You're leaving? When? Now? Right now? On the supply ship that came last night. I must go now. I'm at the pier. I don't have time to see you. What? You too? At 1600, freight plane to Truk Islands. I see. Hello? Hello? Hello? I... Hello? Hello? Take care. Yes. You too. Hello? Hello? Who was it? Urgent? No. What's wrong? Please fill in your information. Now boarding! Now boarding! Now boarding! I thank you for everything. Me too. After sending all these women back, what would Rabaul become? Well... Now they've lost the confidence to fight enemy planes. Our army. I see. Farewell Rabaul. Take care. I will too. Take care. Goodbye! Goodbye. Take care. Safe journey. Please live on. "To live". What a nice word. We all want to live. But I doubt that old ship... can make it back to Japan. Recently, some of our supply ships... were sunk by enemy bombers. - Kiyokawa. - Yes? I used to fly this plane to Guadalcanal... or Port Moresby. Captain. If you say this... I'll cry! Damn! Those bastards! Take shelter! Hurry. Yellow Snake! Oh no! It's attacking our ship! Kiyokawa. Is it ready? Kiyokawa! Start it up! Do it! - It's not been tested... - Forget that! - Yoshida! - Don't stop me! It's Yellow Snake. I've always wanted to fight it! Start it up! Yes. Yoshida. I'll do it. Captain. But you're going to Truk Islands! What if? Yoshida. Kiyokawa! Hurry! Captain! Get off the plane! Now! You're flying it? Yes! Get off! You sure? Get off! Captain! Are you sure? Captain! Watch out! Kiyokawa, watch out! Kiyokawa! The last hero of Rabaul. It's not him. Farewell Rabaul, until we meet again. My tears keep running down. The lovely coral islands, the cross star and the coconut trees. Farewell Rabaul, until we meet again. My tears keep running down. The lovely coral islands, the cross star and the coconut trees. THE END
