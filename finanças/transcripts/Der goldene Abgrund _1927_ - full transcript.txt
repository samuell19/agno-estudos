"GOLDEN ABYSS" - Inspired by Andr? Armandy's celebrated novel Direction: Mario Bonnard Photography: R Aubourdier M Greenbaum Cast - Liane Haid in a dual role as Jola and Claire Andre Roanne as Jean Hudin Hans Albers as Baron Armand Fire! Destiny separated the two little girls for evermore. Twenty years later Whoever catches me earns the right to a kiss. Sir, you must pay me. I cannot wait any longer. That woman will be your ruin. I don't need your advice. Since you don't accept my advice it's a shame you accepted my money. I'll pay you back shortly. Sir wishes to go out? How careless. A scratch... The injury to the heart is much more serious. Watch out. She'll ruin you, like she ruined me. Now you despise me. In vain, Hudin chases oblivion. Farewell, dear life! Deaf to the advice from the mysterious character, Hudin... What you were about to do was foolhardy, young man. Trust me. I can offer you a hundred times what you lost. I'll expect you tomorrow at five. And now, here's your gun. Gentlemen, I'm glad I've stepped between yourselves and Death. You... why did you wish to die? Commander Corleven. I owe money... I left the service... and worse, I missed my shot. Hartog, stock broker... I gambled and I... I, Hudin, wanted to die... ...for a woman! - Me, dear Sir... it's very simple: I'm bored. Many Armands have died of boredom... Very well, gentlemen. I'm disposed to grant you the chance to start your live over - provided you obey me blindly. We'll sail to unexplored lands, to places where we'll find the most glorious treasures. Should we fail, you'll all find, upon your return, a considerable amount of money deposited in your names. Do people get bored in your far away places? I don't think there'll be any time. "...I don't want there to be any further victims. I'll take her with me." In the middle of the Pacific, a wild island, inhabited by a gang of outlaws, stranded there by storms. After the fire on board, the missionary managed to reach this isle with the other twin. I'm very old, little Jola. I can barely see and I'm awfully tired. You'll have to go to fetch water by yourself. Beware of Coreto's men... Until now, a superstitious fear has filled them with respect for me; They fear that I'd bring down God's punishment over them. Who will protect you when I'm gone? Coreto, renowned adventuress, was the leader of this band of pirates. You must feel very secure to taunt me so... Jola! Now, gentlemen, the hour has come for you to learn... Long, long ago, Atlantis was right here. The sea sunk this huge continent. Only one small island, Rapa-Nu, escaped the cataclysm. According to certain documents, this island holds the treasures of the Incas. But mighty volcanic catastrophes threaten the isle. We have to find those treasures... A few hours later. Where is Commander Corleven? Killed! Who are you? What right have you to attack us? To hell with rights! Nobody is in charge here, unless we pick somebody to lead us. Obey, and you'll have nothing to fear. I say we kill them and take their boat. Leave the island? Have you forgotten the noose that awaits you? They might know the whereabouts of the treasure, we've been searching for in vain... Free them and watch them closely. Once they've led us onto the track... I'll take care of them. Coreto, who appeared all but indifferent to Hudin, presided over the festivities undertaken in honour of the strangers. Let the strongest among you have her. Your turn, stranger. How did you end up here? Who with? With my blind old father. So you do cry... Why talk to me this way? Hush. You couldn't know... Let me go, I beg you. Let me go, I'm begging you! Plagued by jealousy, Coreto, however, doesn't dare disturb Hudin's rest. And the following day... Cowards! Then I'll have to bring her back myself. Why did you open the door? The air is heavy, as though storm laden. I'll fetch water. Don't let me catch you roaming the island as long as they are here. If you harass her her again you'll have to deal with me. Threats? So be it. I cherish the sound of your voice. But never forget you owe me total obedience, just like the others. It's undignified not to help that young woman. We've come here to look for the Inca Treasure, not for anything else. I'm with you, Hudin. Sir, they want to kill your friend. Go away. If they find you here they'll slaughter us. Trust me. I'll save you. This man is honest, Jola. Flee with him. But first... Tomorrow, at dawn, climb the volcano... This map shows the place where the treasure is hidden. Now, flee. Try to make it to the coast. I'll catch up with Jola. Cursed. I curse you! The other two have escaped as well. They must have discovered the hiding place. Thank you, honourable crook. Where is Hudin? I will make you talk! Look! Take her. I'll entrust her to you. Escort her to life... I'll... I'll die with this island. We'll have to get through... There's the boat... Saved! That's Hudin, owner of Rapa-Nui. Since his return Hudin has been on a lucky streak. Furthermore, dear friend, he brought back a charming woman. A little smile, noble steed...
