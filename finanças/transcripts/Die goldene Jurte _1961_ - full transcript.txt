The Golden Yurt a co-production with Mongolkino Ulaanbaatar (Mongolian People's Republic) Once upon a time the Wise Arat, an ordinary man of the people, rode through the secluded grassland of Mongolia. The eternal song of the wind was his companion. He came from far away, he had seen the cloudy snow on high peaks, he had traversed the eternity of the desert, and now he approached the chain of mountains beyond which lay the concealed valley of red flowers. There existed a circular lake whose secret he had once confided to the herdsman Pagwa. As long as the clear surface of the lake would blink, there could be no misery for men and animals in the valley of red flowers. Pagwa owned the key to a chest which had a particular feature. Noone was allowed to open it, since otherwise the lake would run dry and the meadows would desiccate under the burning sun. By now many years had passed. The Wise Arat had set off to survey if Pagwa still guarded the secret. He also wanted to meet Pagwa's three sons who had meanwhile grown up. One day they would be resposible for the valley that nurtured big herds. The Wise Arat was impatient and lashed on his horse to get him there quickly. Look around, black stallion. We arrived in the beautiful valley of red flowers. The lake is still clear and pure. Pagwa heeded my advice. I'm curious what became of him, black stallion. And of his sons who have meanwhile grown up. We want to ride there, but we don't want to reveal immediately who we are. From now on I'm the wolf hunter Arrasch. And you're not my fiery stallion, but a tired horse. Jombo! Jombo, get up! Wipe the sleep out of your eyes. The night has been long enough. Learn a lesson from your older brother. Since the day your mother died, he is the treasure of my old age. What's the matter? Why are the horses agitated? What does it mean? Isn't Dawadorshi with them? - Our junior rode off, father. He rode off... Father won't ever forgive him for not having looked after the horses. Give me something to drink, brother. You know as well as I do that we need to wait until the old man gets back. That can take a long while. Until then I'll have died of thirst. And what if I now infringe the old custom? For your sake. What will you give me in return? How dare you? The coin is false. Recently they imprisoned a fraud who tried to pay with such a coin. - I'm not a fraud. I didn't know. A stranger found his way to us. Come on, sons. We want to receive the guest worthily. Where did he find that one? This poor slob is just right on cue for our join. Do you see the wolf skin hanging beside the saddle? I welcome you, stranger. Your life and your sons' lives shall be as pleasant and bright as this morning. We thank you, stranger. Where did you rove around, you fool? I meant you. Allow me to ask: Who are you? Where are you headed? They call me Arrasch the wolf hunter. Whereever the beast may appear, my arrow will strike it. Welcome, wolf hunter Arrasch. I?m the herdsman Pagwa. And those are my sons. My oldest son is called Jombo. You've already met Dawadorshi. Step closer. May they be the pride and joy of all your days. Be welcome as a guest in our humble yurt. Take care of the stranger's horse and roast something good. Hurry up! Well, you tired crock. Let's see the wolf skin. It likely won't be worth to buy it with good money. Hey! Back then we were almost dying of thirst. The children were still small, the youngest one hadn't yet been born. But when we arrived here, our misery was over. The Wise Arat was our benefactor, he allocated the valley to us. He also gave you an important advice, Pagwa. Didn't he? What's that supposed to mean? I dodn't understand you, wolf hunter. You're talking about an advice? Pagwa, I think that now you understand my words. What? It's you. The Wise Arat is sitting in front of me. Finally I can thank you. We're fine, Wise Arat. Our herds are thriving well. Such a joy! I have to call my sons and tell them who's our guest. I don't want you to tell them. Your sons should think I'm the wolf hunter Arrasch. All right, if that's your wish I won't tell them. But you don't need to fear their nosiness. They don't know about our old secret. They know no harm and enjoy life. Greed and envy are unknown to them. I always carry the key you gave me with me. And I've hidden the chest under my kills. Noone suspects anything. I forbid my sons to approach the skins or touch them. Your treasure of gold has been in safe hands. No need to be concerned. All these years I never dared to open the chest, even though curiosity beset me. You entrusted your treasure of gold with me and I wouldn't abuse your trust. You should find it untouched when arriving here. And I cleverly prevented my sons from temptation by forbidding them. We'll have to see if your approach has been clever. But what am I hearing? You're talking about a treasure of gold? I told you the chest encloses air. And due to the pressure water gets pressed into the pond underground. And as long as there's water in the pond, the meadows won't wither. They will remain fertile. - I know that's what you told me. And the lake will run dry if anyone unlocks the key and lets the air escape. Truly a sly idea to hide the treasure from a nosy person. I immediately saw through it. You could have really entrusted me the whole truth. It's the whole truth, Pagwa. But you turned it into a dangerous secret. Father! We've got everything prepared. - Wait. Don't come in yet! You see, Pagwa? A small coincidence and your hide-and-seek is of no use. Come in and arrange the banquet, sons! Due to your hospitality I feel strengthened and invigorated. A skillfull work. Who carved it? Our youngest brother. In that regard he's gifted. As a farewell present I give you this ball. I have to get going. Today I want to traverse the Gobi desert. Dawadorshi! Get away! You know that father doesn't want us to touch his kills. Pagwa! Sooner or later you'll have to tell your sons, Pagwa. Children don't need to know everything. But he deserves a punishment. He ignored my prohibition. He should be ashamed. Your path to enlightment won't be easy, Pagwa. Farewell! Please don't be angry! The valley of red flowers should remain fertile for man and animal. - Thanks. Crossing the Gobi desert before sunset on such a lame crock? A joke. Brother! I think I'm dreaming in broad daylight! Reaching the mountains he'll certainly collapse. Dawadorshi, did you notice anything particular about the place I forbade you? No, I didn't notice anything. - And the two of you? Dawadorshi kneeled in front of your kills. We didn't notice anything. Was there anything? - Nothing. Stop asking. Get back to work. It's your fault we're getting blamed. Earlier you skipped work. It's your turn. Don't dare to talk about the chest we discovered. - Yes. What did you find, brother? A wallet. The stranger must have lost it. - A wallet? Let me see! Dawadorshi! Wait! Don't ride off! Let's share! Dawadorshi! Listen! Let's follow him. He shouldn't escape us. Come on! Wait! Dawadorshi! Wait! Dawadorshi!! Wait! You'll draw the short straw! We finally got big luck and that one has nothing better to do than spoiling it. So what? Those few gold coins in the wallet. We're soon going to own a much bigger treasure. - Yes? Which treasure? Wolf hunter Arrasch! Wolf hunter Arrasch! Ah, my wallet! Thank you! Should I nurse your horse back to health until you return, wolf hunter? I give you mine in return. You got a very arduous journey ahead of you. I consent to the exchange, Darwadoshi! I want to reward your deed. Take this arrow! If you should ever be in danger and need help, a seven day's journey from here you'll get to a Wise Arat. This arrow will show you the way. Thank you, wolf hunter. I will... Greetings to the friends from afar! Where are you going, fellow countrymen? - We got a long road ahead. We want to go to the market. One question: Have you seen a black lamb? It's my daughter's favorite pet. It ran away. No, but I'll bring it to you if I should find it. Dawadorshi keeps us waiting and I have to do his work. It would be good if he didn't arrive before sunrise. I see, you mean because of the hidden chest. A stranger's lamb. You idiot! Jombo! Jombo! What are you doing there? Idiot! Why didn't you hold the lamb? - He surprised us. In the Gobi desert I caught up with the wolf hunter and returned his wallet. That's good, my son! But what about the lamb? It escaped a pesant woman from afar. Allow me, father, to bring it to her tomorrow on the market. - Do that, my son! You did the right thing! Stealing animals gets punished harshly. You could have slaughtered it secretly. None of my sons does that. - Of couse not. Never. Turn out the light. Sleep peacefully. - Sleep peacefully, father. What are you looking for? Can I help you? - Be quiet. Get to sleep again! That won't heal quickly! Take my brown horse! The stranger's horse needs to rest. That's for you, brother! Buy whatever you like on the market! Thanks, Jombo. I wish you a nice day! Here, Jombo. Hold it. Here! The lamb! Hold it well! You gave him the false coin. They're going to lock him up. Then we'll get rid of him for a while. How can you even wish for such an evil thing, Jombo? You can now look at yourself in the mirror. - That looks nice. - Thanks. What's the matter? Can't you wait? - Come. Stop! Rugs! Come on, people! Buy rugs! The best rugs! Wonderful rugs! You better take a look at this! Colorful patterned rugs from faraway countries! Colorful patterned rugs from faraway countries! Best quality! - Really splendid! This rug is the most beautiful one! - I see! Put the jar in the shadow, my child! - Yes, mother! - And take a rest. What a joy! We considered the lamb lost. And now you bring it back to us! My daughter will be full of joy. Sarren-Gerrel! Hey, is that your horse? It can't remain on the market. Take it to the meadow! Your little lamb! Are you happy, Sarren-Gerrel? Yes, hold it firmly! It shall never again run away! Who brought it back? A handsome young man. If you could only see him, my daughter! Young and good-looking. As slender as a foal! Isn't anyone here? Aren't you selling anything? I'm coming soon! I need a rug! - Please take your choice! Exquisite silk fabric! Colorful and cheap! Best quality! Buy silk fabric! Very cheap! Beautiful silk fabric! - Do you want to buy boots? Wonderful silver necklaces! Unique ones! Wonderful jars! Don't run away! Take a look around! Come here! I got a broad selection! Perhaps one of these necklaces? With pearls. Could I please take a look? I got something really special for you. Look, how do you like this one? Or how about this one? The quality is very high. You'll never again get it this cheap! You better buy it! Silk fabric! Buy it, people! He's asleep! Listen, brother! - You'll be able to drink whatever you want. The treasure is inside the chest. We'll be able to buy any kind of delicacy. Don't be afraid! Come on! I'll make sure he won't notice. We'll be abe to buy anything we like. Let me go! - Don't be a coward! He certainly won't wake up. Go away! Stop! Get away! What am I seeing? That's how you turned out! I'm unfortunate. Do you really have to disappoint me like that, Jorrup? You of all people! What are you doing near the kills. Didn't I forbid it? Have you forgotten that you need to obey your father? Get out! Get out! - Enough already! You forbade it and we know exactly why. We're not stupid. We know what's hidden under the kills: An enormous treasure that could make all of us rich. There's no treasure. Inside the chest there's just air. Do you understand? No, there's water inside. The most precious asset we possess. I'm telling you the truth. Don't touch the chest! Jombo! Jorrup! Why are you looking for a treasure? Aren't we rich enough? Don't we have sufficient herds and fertile meadows? Shouldn't we be content with what we've got? But you strive after gold, jewels and idleness. I see through you. I never expected that from you! Get out! Leave! Get out! You wanted to steal from me. Is that how you reward my love? You disappointed this old man! Jombo! We're leaving! Who has been deceived during all these years? "Don't touch my old kills!" No! Wait! Don't go away! I told you the truth! Believe me! I won't let the old man tell me any more lies. I wonder where he's hiding the key. He always carries it on a long string around his neck. You're saying that. But did you actually see the key? I think so. I think so. - You're a coward! You aren't of any use. - I'm no coward! - You need to prove me that. To prove you? - I know you well. But how? What should I do? Oh, Dawadorshi is coming back! Thus they didn't catch him with the false coin. I don't understand that. We definitely need to get rid of him. And he shouldn't learn about the chest. Come here, dear brother. We let our arrows buzz. Show us the elasticity of your new bow! You're a fine shooter, Dawadorshi! More than a hundred feet off target. Don't get angry, little brother. Rather show us what you bought on the market. I didn't buy anything. There were lots of nice things, but I got everything I need. There, thank you! You can keep it! If I had known that, I wouldn't have spared you my horse. You fool! Yes, a fool! How can we even keep on living together under one roof? Leave our yurt! Quickly! Go whereever you want! Father! What's the matter with you, father? Is something wrong? Are you sick? My son! Misfortune is about to come! I don't know what I should do. Escape from this place, Dawadorshi! Here doubts and injustice are spreading. Gloom beset me. I won't ever be happy again! He's coming. Most likely he complained. Please lend me your brown horse again, brother. - Are you leaving? Our father is all gloomy. - I know why. He worries about you. I want to cross the mountains to consult a wise man regarding father's health. You want to ride on Jorrup's horse until it's emaciated. See how you get along with the crock you exchanged for your good horse. Don't take it badly, brother. He means well. Why are you so harsh, Jombo? - You can't have the brown horse. It's saddle-sore and needs to rest. - That's a lie. What? - Stop! Why so hot tempered, brothers? We don't want to argue. Don't worry! The wolf hunter's horse will surely make it. Just ride unhurriedly and the lame won't bother you. Dawadorshi, I wish you good luck! - He'll be away for a long while. Now the two of us will have lots of leeway. The treasure in the chest will definitely be mine. Greetings. What happened? - For three moons now the river is dry. There's no water. It's easy to live without gold. But it's impossible to live without water. Bring us help, because otherwise we'll have to die of thirst. Take our treasure. We gladly give it away. I'm about to visit a wise man in order to consult him. I'm going to ask him why your river ran dry and bring you help. It's not that easy to trick me. Tomorrow you move to the black yurt. I no longer want to live under the same roof with you. Hey, keep hold of your dog! Who may that be? I greet you, stranger. Strap your horse! Be good! I greet you. - Ah, it's you! Come into the yurt! I'm happy to see you. Do you know who has arrived, daughter? The young man who returned our lamb. You thanked me. But the one holding it doesn't thank me. She doesn't utter a word. Don't be angry with my daughter. Since her birth Sarren-Gerrel is blind. She lives without light and joy. She's unaware of the beauty of the world. Excuse my displeasure. I'm on my way to visit a wise man. Here. Drink that! I'm also going to ask him how your daughter may be able to see again. Hey, what are you doing there? Who are you? Don't you know it's forbidden to burst the Mongolian earth and farm it. You're right, my son. It's forbidden. But who made this absurd prohibition? The powerful people did it to let the folk starve. But the folk will resist and build dams of seed against the hunger. Tell me, young man. What are you doing in this forsaken place? I'm looking for the Wise Arat. I want to ask for his advice and help. You found him, my friend. The one you look for is standing in front of you. It's you? - Yes, it's me. Come on. You must be tired due to the long ride. Let's get inside. Get in, my son. - Thanks. Which questions do you need answers for? Well? For whom do you request advice? A beautiful girl will never be happy... - Stop! Don't let your heart gallop quicker than your tongue. Consider well for whom help is most needed. Help is most needed for... At a khanate the river ran dry. The meadows are withered. Men and animals are suffering from thirst. They have to die if there won't be a wonder. One has to bethink instead of waiting for wonders. One has to trace the reasons for misery. Tell the inhabitants of the khanate who are without water that they need to ride to the river head. There they'll see how to get rid of their misery. Remember these words, my son! The powers of the earth only serve those freely who don't shy away from effort. You see: There are no wonders. Luck won't just fall into one's lap. Come on. I'm going to show you how many treasures await getting unearthed. Go ahead! People will dig and blow up. They'll drill, excavate and unearth whatever may serve the well-being of everyone if all make use of it. Let's go further! Over there, my friend! Don't look until your eyes get tired! Much is expected from you before the sun sets. Take a little rest! Sit down! Enjoy the meal. You need to gather strength for the deeds that are expected from you, Dawadorshi. You know my name, Wise Arat? - Oh, yes. I also know your father. I know that he's sick and gloomy. Otherwise you wouldn't be here. What can I do to help him? - How you could help him? Your father will be healthy again. The gloom will leave him if he puts the treasure that remains him close to his heart. Please also give me an advice for the blind girl. How can one help her? The blind beauty will see once the young man who is meant to be her husband touches her left hand. Now I need to get going. My horse is a bit lame. I shouldn't wreck it. The wolf hunter Arrasch gave it to me to nurse it. Back then you helped me when I was in distress, Dawadorshi. Therefore I want to reward you. Instead of your lame horse, you can take the fiery black stallion grazing at the hillside. It shall be yours. I thank you, wolf hunter, Arrasch. Farewell! - Good luck! Before three drops fall, the black stallion will bring you to your destination. Just listen! Can you hear it? Stand still, black stallion! Be welcome! We've been awaiting you. Did you find the Wise Arat? Come in! Be welcome in our yurt! I'm bringing the Wise Arat's answer. Your daughter will see once the young man meant to be her husband touches her left hand. Mother! I see you! Daughter! The wise man said the truth! I see the whole beautiful world. Such a happy day! My beloved child can see. My daughter will see once the young man meant to be her husband touches her left hand. Wasn't that your message? - Yes, that's what the wise man said. Then you're meant to be her husband. You touched my daughter's left hand. My beloved child! My child! I'm so happy! I'm so happy. Now you will stay with us. We got many sheep. Each day you will eat fat meat. Excuse me, I can't yet stay. I need to get going to also help others. That's what the wise man told me. Dawadorshi! From now on I don't want to ever separate from you! Not even for one hour. Please take me with you! Yes, Sarren-Gerrel! Ride with him! I will soon follow you. I bring you the wise man's answer. The inhabitants of your valley should ride to the river head. There they will see how to free themselves from their misery. How should we ride? We're too weak. Water! - I'm going to ride for you. Water! Water! Water! The road is getting too steep. We need to dismount. Come on. Down there must be the river head. The rock fell down and blocked it. That looks like gold. - Real gold? Yes. We need to remove it. Help me! Water! There's a fish! Sarren-Gerrel! A fish! Poor little fish. How long did you have to lie in this murky tarn? And noone came to help you. Dawadorshi! The spring is opened. Look, my little fish! Watch out! Now you'll again have a good time. You can swim blithely in the water. Stand still! Lean over the water! The water khan calls you to enter his kingdom. - Dawadorshi! You have to obey the water khan! I'll run to the black stallion and wait for you. - Ok. Wait, little fish! You can speak! What am I to do here? I won't go any step further. What's that? Who are you? Am I dreaming? A little while ago you were a little fish! Tell me! What am I to do here? Don't be curious. Come on! Otherwhise my father, the water khan, gets angry and turns into a turtle. He always does that when he rages. Come on! You see! He got angry. Who is it that you're bringing? - A human being, father. He saved me. Come here! I apologize, father. I'll never again turn into a fish and look for adventure. Be welcome, young man! You saved my daughter! And thus you returned my dearest belonging. I like you. He should stay with us! Don't let him go away! Good. I'm going to test him. You should adorn yourself and wait. I want to royally reward you for your good deed. Tell me a wish! - I just want to soon ride back with my bride. I want to see if the inhabitants of the valley got water and didn't die of thirst. Not so fierce, my friend! Come closer! The inhabitants of the valley now got enough water. The old river bed is filling up again. We want to see if the folk enjoy the cool water which will refresh them and grant them new zest for life. Well? Are you happy? Yes, they're saved. Tell me another wish. Or don't. Wait! I'm going to show you treasures which are too magnificent for a human being to imagine. Stay with us, young man. I give you my daughter as a wife! Her playmates should circuit you. And they should antipicate your every wish. On my most beautiful horses you should ride through the immeasurable range of my undersea kingdom. Stay with us, young man! I want to share all my treasures with you. I'm thanking you, water khan. I can't stay with you. What? You can't? If I want it, you have to stay with us! You can't force me! I'm not afraid of you! I want to get back to my beloved bride Sarren-Gerrel. Together with her I will ride to my father's place to cure his gloom. Just as the Wise Arat told me. You passed the tests, young man! I won't hold you back anymore. I will give you three farewell presents. But you yourself need to consider how to make use of them. Because on earth their miraculous power only works once. Here! Take this magic cap! Nobody will see you if you put it on your head. You're allowed to test it once. Take this golden hammer! As soon as you hit it on the ground three times, a golden yurt will appear in front of you. Take this sheepshkin. If you shake it three times, rain will fall triply for three hours. Thank you, water khan! Farewell, my friend! You'll soon return to your bride. Wait! I first want to see if your path into the wide territory is free. A windstorm is about to come. Remain in the cave until the sky has cleared. Take hold of him. Take his feet. Be careful! Slowly! There! Jorrup! Jorrup! Jorrup! Jorrup! Get back! Father! What's the matter with you? Why did our lake run dry? Speak! - Is something wrong with you? She's my bride. - Are you sick? I welcome you! My sorrow has vanished. Now I'm happy and confident. - Where are the brothers? It's your brothers' fault that the lake ran dry and that the fertile valley of red flowers will wither. Last night they fled with their yurt, the carriage and all animals. Where did they ride? - They must have went southward to look for fertile land. Dawadorshi! Where do you want to go? Don't leave! Stay calm! He wants to follow them and get them back. They won't ever abandon you again, father. Hey, you! Wake up! Look at that! The horse! Our entire herd is gone! Couldn't you pay attention? Do you always have to sleep, lazybone? It's your fault! Look, father! The herd returned. You're right! Such a joy! But where's Dawadorshi? I don't know. - Here! Where are your brothers? - In the steppe. They'll find their way back. I'm glad that I now also got a lovely daughter beside my sons. But the black yurt is too small for all of us. And the wind permeates mine. For quite a while I wished to have another. But how should we get one? Don't let that upset you, father. I know a solution. I must be dreaming. Is this golden yurt supposed to be ours? But unfortunately we won't be able to live inside. We lack water. The valley of red flowers is withered. Before rain falls, we and the animals will have died of thirst. Look, father! All those beautiful things! And all this is really supposed to be ours? - Yes, father. The chest! The chest is back! Dawadorshi is back! The golden yurt certainly belongs to him. As well as the fiery stallion. - Yes, our brother suddenly got rich. It was noone else but him who stole our herd. The animals aren't his, they belong to our father. Dawadorshi just returned it to him. The old man will send us to hell. Maybe he'll have pity on us. It's our fault. If we only hadn't opened the chest. When the rain stops, the sun will sear everything. One should contain the water. Then all the misery would end. We need to clog the hole. - Yes, hold on. Attention! Jorrup! There! - Great! You also need to put something on the left side. - Where? - On the left. Wait, I'll get some more. Here! - Quickly! I need even more. It already accumulates. There it's again! Can you hear the gurgling sound? The chest is connected to the underwater pond that provides our lake with water. There! - Give it to me! Is it still not enough? The gurgling sound is increasingly getting louder. What does that mean? Come on! Let's have a look! Jorrup! Give me your hand! Careful! Come on! I'll pull you out. Hold on! Just a bit further! Just look! My sons helped us. They got back on the right track. The animals will no longer be thirsty. The valley of red flowers again holds water. The End
