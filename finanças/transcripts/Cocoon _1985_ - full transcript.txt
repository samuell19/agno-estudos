You boys still trespassing over there? Yep. Hey, they're not even melted yet. Wow. Okay, let's get a board under her. Let's get a pulse, let's get a blood pressure. I'll get a line. No pulse. - Eighty over 50. - Keep pumping. Ready! Clear. Now. Is there a pulse or a blood pressure? Once more. Everyone off now. - Is there a pulse? - No pulse. - Blood pressure? - No blood pressure. All right. Let's call it. Well, what's the word? What's the word on what? The doctor. That's what. You went to the doctor. Now, what'd he say? It's a breeze. Everything's fine. Hey, wait a minute. Wait right there. This is me you're talking to. Now, you went to the goddamn doctor. Now, what did he say? Doctors don't know everything. Well, there is the one school of thought that says they don't know nothing. Well, gentlemen, mission accomplished. Hope the water isn't too cold. You want it heated, too? What about a lifeguard? Well, the marines have landed. The navy's in. Boy, that's cold. You're right. Ah! Fellows, this is the life. That'll make your old ball sac shrivel up. Well, all in all, that was a pretty damn crappy day at sea, wasn't it, boys? You stink. Me? Come on, man. It's the great unknown out there. Here. Here's half your money. "Half"? What do you... What is this "half"? Bonner, you got my goddamn money now? Got it right here. I got it right here. I'll be with you in a second, okay? 'Cause if you ain't got it now, you're not tying up here. Look, I don't want to get rough with you, you know, but I'm not taking half. Fine. Give it. What are you... Get your hands off. Just get your ass off my boat, man. Just get your ass off my boat. You believe this? And take your embarrassing beach towel with you. Guy brings a beach towel. You believe these tourists? Guy throws up on the deck, he doesn't catch one fish, gives me half my money. I need a brew. You want something cold? Untie the boat line. No, wait a minute. Don't untie the boat line. Here you go, you bloodsucker. I have nothing to live on. Nothing. Zip. Kirk, come on. You're not actually gonna take all my money, are you? You're gonna leave me with five bucks, aren't you, Kirk? Not on your life. Shit! Come on, Kirk. That money will bring you no pleasure! I promise you. Can I have a word... You just try and sleep tonight! I'll sleep like a baby. Shit! We'd like to rent your boat. You what? We'd like to rent your boat. We'd like to rent your boat for 27 days, if that wouldn't be too long for you. No. Yeah. Yeah? Twenty-seven? That's my lucky number. Holy smokes! Hi. I'm Jack Bonner. How you doing? Hi, Jack. I'm Walter. Hi. Hi, Walter. Well, come on. Yeah, take a look around. Boat sleeps eight, so you should be pretty comfortable. And if you've got a latitude and a longitude, I can get you there. And if you don't, I can still get you there. We know a great dive spot, and we have a map. Great, great. I guess we can talk price later. That door basically slides back and forth. It may need some oil. I haven't dusted in a while, but I'm gonna do a whole cleanup, a whole sanitation thing. You know, if you look at anything closely enough, you're bound to find some flaws. I'm an experienced scuba diver and tour guide, deep-sea fisherman, who'll actually eat tonight. Yes! In the kitchen. You're in the kitchen. And my mother came out on the porch, and she was screaming... Give it a rest, Rose. "You stop teasing your sister!" Hiya, Grandpa. There's the little fellow. You come right to the courts, do you? It's Thursday. Knows our schedule. Hi! Hello, David. Hello, David. He's always here. Does this kid have a home or what? Bernie, his parents are divorced. His mother works. Hey, I'm an orphan. Do I go around asking for breaks? We're going swimming later. We have room left for one little boy. And we might even have a swimming suit for you. I got mine on. The navy could use men like you. The property's been tied up in an estate now for over three years. And, of course, they really want to sell. They're not interested in a long-term lease. Well, we'd just like the place for 26 days. And we'll take it in "as is" condition. We're cousins. We like to vacation together informally. As long as there's a swimming pool, we have everything we need. $7,500 a month, plus the pool man and utilities. We won't be needing the pool man. I prefer to do that myself. They use so much chlorine. My eyes are very sensitive. But they're lovely. Thank you. The clubhouse is closed, boys. Well, maybe they'd give us permission to use the pool. We could offer to pay something. Wouldn't be fun if we had permission. Jack, this is the chart I was telling you about. I estimate our position is right about here, at this point. I want to get down right along this fault line. Just south, right here. Is this land? What is this? This is actually an underwater configuration map. It's a heat-sensitive map. I've seen these. Yeah, it's a brand-new development. The Japanese have this. Yeah, that's right, Jack. The Japanese. They developed it. So the point is to head directly south right along this line... Sure. ...until we get right here on the edge of this fault line. Perfect. Can you figure that out? Yeah. Actually, I've been around here. Why don't you keep this? Okay. All right. Go get some sodas and sandwiches and stuff. Thanks, Jack. Okay. All right. Let's start with line three. "T, O, Z." And the next line. "L, P, E, O." Try the next line. "K, O, C..." "K, O, C, F, E." Sir, do you have another pair of glasses? I don't need any other glasses, young man. These are my glasses. I can read that fine. Now you just run the pointer. All right? Next line. Sir, is there anything on that line you can read? No. But, young man, remember, road signs aren't made that small. I can read road signs. Okay. I don't think it's fair. I've driven everything on wheels all my life. Never had a mishap. Shit. How's your girlfriend? She's not my girlfriend. She just followed me home that one day. I don't like her at all. You don't, huh? Hi, Dad. Hi, honey. Hi, Mom. Want to go out to dinner? Yeah. No Italian food. Makes me fart. Okay. I'll go get Mom. You know, you're gonna have to make a friend your own age one of these days. I don't like the kids my age. I like to hang around you guys. Sure you like it here. There's no pressure, and we baby you. It's just that a lot more things bother me than other guys. They do, do they? The trouble with you is you think too much, and that's when a guy gets scared. You know, Grandpa, you're right. I do get scared a lot. Nobody likes being scared. Hey, watch out. Those dolphins look pretty horny. This is pretty big. Yeah, pretty big. You need a hand? No. No. Thanks, Jack. We're doing fine. Excuse me. What the hell is that? Who cares? You know what I bet? I bet they're dope peddlers. I'll bet they made a pickup out at sea. It's possible. Should we tell somebody? No. Well, by golly, if our new neighbors are gonna do that, I don't feel a bit bad about sneaking in their swimming pool while they're gone. Do you think it's safe? What are they gonna do? Arrest us? Look at us. We're three harmless old men. Yeah, but who knows what kind of people they are? You know, I can't remember the last time I really took a risk. Ben's right. I'm in. What the hell. Look at that. The water's really warm. What the hell are those? Listen to that. They make me nervous. If your friend Ben Luckett decides to jump off the top of the Empire State Building, does that mean that you have to do it, too? I have my pride. Well. I feel great! Me, too. You wouldn't bullshit me. My God, I'm telling the truth. Why shouldn't he feel good? I feel tremendous! I'm ready to take on the world! I'm in the mood for love Simply because you're near me You get a load of this guy? He'll be chasing them dolls till his dick rots off. I'm too old for that kind of thing. Age isn't everything. No, no. Anyway, it's all up here. Sure, sure. Not all up there, pal. Some of it's down here. Which, by the way, is hard as a rock. You, too? You got a boner, too? Blue steel. Cat couldn't scratch it. I thought I was the only one. We're in the mood for love Simply because we've got one You tired? Aren't you? I'm wide awake. What's wrong? Not a thing. Art. It's so late. Are you all right? Some enchanted evening You may see a stranger You may see a stranger Across a crowded room Want a piece of candy, little girl? Ben! Ben. Pong. Three. Ghost dragon. Why is everybody so quiet today? You're all off in another world or something. I was just thinking to myself. Me, too. I was just thinking. I feel so nice today, I can't tell you. Joe. Let's go! Morning. Morning. Hi. Shit. Excuse me. Do you think there's cocaine in that pool? There might be. What if we OD? Well, we'll keep an eye on each other. I'll watch him. You watch him. You watch me. Perfect. Stop! Hey. Hi. Looks like you got these things pretty well-covered. Looks airtight. Jack, I can't tell you what's inside there. You know, I'm the captain. Technically speaking, I have to know what's in there. Yeah, but what we're doing is supposed to be a secret. Kitty, I took a maritime oath, a maritime oath that forbids me to even reveal your names to anybody. All right. I'll tell you, but you can't let the others know that I told you anything. They'd have to torture me. Not a lot of torture. You know, not... But some. Nerita peloronta. What? Nerita peloronta. What is that? They're giant snail shells. Hmm. They're extremely rare. We're gonna take them to the Museum of Ichthyology in Orlando. Really? Yeah, I've been planning to go there. I hear it's a great place, a lot of fish. God! God, I think it's broken. God damn it! Let me help you. Ice. Get something cold on it. Let me just look. No, no. Don't. Do not touch it. I can... I can help you. No. No, no. That feels nice. It's amazing. Kitty, are you married? No. Involved? No. Come on. Those guys are so good-looking. Not Walter, maybe, but... You don't have anything going with one of those young guys? I'm not involved with anyone. Okay. You know, we could go out and do something sometime. I don't know if that's such a good idea. Why? I'm not like the other women you've known. That's good news. You're making me very curious about you. Well, what if I trusted you with something very private? I can keep a secret. I won't tell anybody. Not even our kids. Look, I don't know what you're thinking, but if you're thinking that I'm just out to nail you, that's not it at all. I'd just like to get to know you as a human being. Okay. I'll see you in the morning. All right? What... Yeah, I got... I got some things to do, too. And they didn't give you any other medication at all over at the home, huh? Not a thing, Doc. Well, Joe, I gotta tell you, I have never seen anything like this before in my life. It's a... Well, it's a miracle. It's a complete remission. I just love to see you eat your words, Doc. Want to arm-wrestle? How about that? Alma's not gonna believe it. You got them, huh? Come on. Let's go, shall we? I'm gonna go ahead and assume goodwill. I'm gonna assume mental illness. I didn't expect it. It's such a surprise. I don't know how to do it. I didn't buy it. It's just beautiful. Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen. We start our second session of dancing right now. And our first tune is a special arrangement of Dancing in the Dark. Let's waste no time. Why don't we dance? What? Sure. Bernie, Bernie, Bernie. What am I going to do with you? I don't know what I'm going to do. Well, you're not going to dance with me. That's for sure. That's for sure. Happy birthday! Many more! Thank you. You're a wonderful dancer. I think so. I'm very happy, Bess. Everything's happening so fast. Are you talking about last night? No, no. Last night was fine. Fine? More than fine. Terrific. I was talking in general. Well, in general, I think we're having a great time. Yes, we are. Will you still love me when I can't keep up with you? Of course. I love you now, and you can't keep up with me. You are a pain in the ass. "There's going to be a problem in the fuel injection system if you let..." What does this do? Reduced to a goddamn Peeping Tom now, Bonner? It's embarrassing. Holy shit. What's the problem, Jack? She's not normal. There's something very abnormal about her. Come on. Come on. Come on. Son of a bitch! All right. Come on! Start! Go! I've put all kinds of people on this boat. All kinds, all races. Come on. All nationalities, all creeds! I... Oh, my God! I can't believe it won't start! Oh, my God. It's... It's hard to know who to trust, isn't it, Jack? Oh, my God! God. I'm in the water, far from shore. It's at night. They've got my boat. Shit. Good to see you again, Jack. - Let me give you a hand. - I don't want your hand. Come on, Jack. Get back! Get back! You get back! No. Just put... Put the towel down. Just put it down and back away, please. Jack, I'm sure you're bothered by what you've seen, but if you'll just relax... Well, I don't want to relax. Why don't you let us explain? 'Cause I don't want to know anything. And if you try to eat my face off or take over my body, you're gonna be very sorry, mister! You're gonna be very sorry! Face-eating, Jack? I've never heard of that. Is that some sort of delicacy? No. Forget I ever mentioned it. Are you sure I shouldn't try it, Jack? I'm positive. Walter, Jack is our friend. Right, Jack? Friend. Friend! That's right. Friend, 100%. I'm your friend. That's all I ever wanted to be. I want to be your friend. Well, we do owe you an explanation. No, you don't owe me anything. All right. You know, not even for the boat. Honestly, it's free. Jack. Of course we're gonna pay you for the boat. We're honest. Of course you're honest. Did I ever accuse you of being dishonest? I accused you of being from another planet, but an honest planet. Jack. Jack, sit down. I don't wanna sit down. Jack, sit! Now, Jack, I want you to listen to me very carefully. We're Antareans. We come from a planet called Antarea. Yeah, that's what I pretty much figured. About 100 centuries ago, we had an outpost here on Earth, before the first upheaval. I think I'm better off not knowing. Now, we were able to evacuate everyone except for my ground crew. Ground crew? And now we've come back for them. Boy, you know, I thought I'd been around. I... Nothing like this has ever happened to me before. Jack, you could turn us in, or perhaps you could do something else that would make things difficult for us, but, believe me, Jack, we will still get our friends back. And the only thing that would happen is we'd end up renting someone else's boat. You know, I got left behind once. It was in Coney Island. I was nine. It was pretty heavy for a nine-year-old. My parents finally came back for me. Of course. Yeah. And now we've come back. So that's what you're doing? You're coming back for your friends? Exactly. Jack, this is the most important thing we've ever done. You're not gonna hurt me, are you, Walt? All we need to do is to get our friends and leave. And go... Yes. Right. None of this is bad for America, I guess. Of course not. Well, damn it, I'm in! This is... This is incredible. Right. Now listen, tell me, nothing's gonna fall off right now, is it? No. Come on, Mr. Lefkowitz. You'll be a new man, Bernie. Believe me. Remember, I said... I said I'd look. Grab there. I'm not promising I'll get wet. Fine. Just look. By the way, right here is where a crime is being committed. Not by me, because I'm being carried. Don't you worry, Bernie. We'll take the fall for you. Fall, fall. That's another thing. I fall, I break my hip, I can't sue anybody. It's nice and warm, Bernie. They're rocks. What are rocks doing in a pool? In an ocean, fine. There I expect to see plenty of rocks, but in a pool? No. Cowardly, cowardly custard, can't cut the mustard! Come on, Bernie! And it's Joe-Joe taking the lead. Come on! Come on! Come on, you worn-out old pusses. Dig, dig, dig, dig! I'll see you tomorrow. Hey, fellows! Fellows! Fellows! Hey! Somebody's coming! - Get out. - Let's get the hell out of here. - Let's get out of here. - Come on! Come on. Get a move on. Hurry. Come on in here. Out of the way! Let's move! Jesus! Let's move! Come on! Quick! Come on. Open the fucking door! Let's go! Go, go, go, go, go! Let's go! Come on! Quick! I begged you not to go. You've got to do something. There are things from outer space next door. You gents just keep sucking on that oxygen, they'll probably go back to their own planet. Get the police, you idiots. Hey, look. I'm not calling no cops because a couple of geezers saw some people from outer space. If my husband said he saw people from outer space, they were from outer space! Get the goddamn police! Okay. Call the police. They... They must have concocted this crazy story to cover themselves. Spacemen, you say? Yeah. That's wonderful. Well, we'll all be that old someday. If we're lucky. Yeah. We're gonna shoot on over to the home there and straighten this whole thing out. Well, I wouldn't be too hard on them. Just tell them that as long as they're willing to respect our privacy in the future, we won't press charges. We'll keep them on their side of the fence. I appreciate it. Yes, sir. Thank you very much. My pleasure. Bye-bye. Well, I guess we shouldn't be greedy about it. We're better off than before we found it. Bess said we should take it to the National Enquirer. They pay money for this kind of story. I wish I had the guts to go in. Yeah. Well, I wish I never even knew about this place. What time is it? Just after 4:00. I'm gonna go talk to them. God damn it. It's ridiculous. You're Walter. Well, I'm not surprised you're here. There's something in that pool out there that a friend of ours just has to have. Matter of fact, there's a few of us could use a little of it. Well, we don't care who you are or where you've been, what you're doing, what you're up to. We sure need that pool. Look, Ben, I know you're just trying to help your people. Well, I'm trying to help mine. No. See, my friend, Joe Finley, he's got cancer. I'm trying to save his life. I'm trying to save 20 lives, and I'm running out of time. Ain't a son of a bitch in the world has to know we're in that pool. We'll just be a few old farts puddling around in that pool. Who's gonna know? Every 10,000 or 11,000 years or so, I make a terrible mistake. The last one was when I picked what you call Atlantis as our base here on Earth. Everyone else said, "Use the North Pole." I said, "No. Too cold." Sinking never occurred to me. You're gonna let us use the pool, aren't you? You won't touch those cocoons? No. No. I swear. Use the pool. Thank you. Thank you. I, for one, don't believe this alien crap at all. You don't believe your husband? No. Well, I believe Joe. I believe him, and I'm scared. I don't believe it, and I'm still scared. I guess I'm just less gullible than you guys. Mary, you have your nerve calling me gullible. I have more horse sense than you'll ever have. Ladies, ladies, let's just go and see for ourselves. Come on. All right. Let's meet the aliens. I hate to go visiting without a plate of cookies, a box of candy or something. We're going home. Will you cut it out, Bernie? Well, we have permission, don't we? Those people aren't people. I'm not gonna have anything to do with them. Pipe down. You're playing with fire over there. I'm a citizen. I believe in this country, and I'm thinking of blowing the whistle on the whole goddamn deal. Come on, Rose. Stop right there. What? What? Stop thinking about yourself. We're doing this for Joe. - Joe? Is Joe above the law? - Yeah. Are any of us? In 1948, Dutch Schultz walked into my store, and he said to me... Dutch Schultz! Bernie. Bernie, shut up. Let me tell you about what Dutch said... Bernie. Bernie! If you don't want to do this for Rose, if you don't want to do it for yourself, that's fine, that's your business. But if you screw it up for the rest of us... Don't threaten me, Joe. I don't want any of your threats. Bernie, please. Let her come with us just this once. No, no. Never. Rose and I will never set foot over there again. Nature dealt us our hand of cards, and we played them. Now, at the end of the game, suddenly you're looking to reshuffle the deck, huh? Come on, Rose. Come on. Let's go. Anybody have second thoughts? Not me. I'm a citizen, too. I was in the navy. I don't see anything wrong with it. Then you drive. I got no license. Hey, are your extraterrestrials gonna make a personal appearance? Hey, Pills. Come on in. Hi, Pillsbury. How you doing, pal? You'll like Pillsbury. He's a fine fellow. All right. Let's start here. "P, E, Z, O, L, C, F, T, D." Sir, what line are you reading? The bottom one. We're in a little bit of a hurry, okay? Look, look, look. We gotta go into the club! I'm gonna take you higher than you ever I'm gonna bring you closer to the river I'm gonna touch you Feel you with a thunder I'm gonna bring you closer to my life You're like gravity pulling me Gravity pulling me There you go!

Hey! Hey! I want to talk to you two! The word on the corridor is that you dudes are on to some kind of rejuvenation. What? You know what I'm talking about. No, we don't. We wish we could help you. Your wife been climbing trees for a long time? She climbs one every once in a while. Once in a great while. That's right. You know, whenever I'm around you, I feel really good. Really good. Do I do that to you? It happens. Do you ever want to do anything about it? Well, not the way you think about it. I mean, I can't. Right. Right. Well, how does an Antarean express affection? We share ourselves. All right! Do you want to try it? It's very fulfilling. Don't touch me. Don't touch you? What's the big deal? All right. I'm gonna tell you the truth. You're not my first Antarean. I'm not naming names... Jack... But... Go to the other side of the pool. I hope you're not gonna take your skin off, because I really like skin on a woman. If this is foreplay, I'm a dead man. Three strikes! Three strikes! I knocked them down. You have marvelous form. I've bowled with a lot of women. You have a great potential. You know, you seem like you're having a grand time. I know I am. Joe, you'll never bowl another game like that as long as you live. Don't count on it. I may turn professional. Yeah, sure. What's next? What's next? What's next? Let's have a party! A party. I'm for that. You bring the hot dog And I'll bring the bun Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey. What? Look at you goddamn people. I mean, I think this is a serious mistake. What are you talking about? A mistake about what? Well, you know, I promised Walter we'd keep it a secret, and look at this. Yeah. Let's not have too much fun, everybody. Remember, we're old. Not for me. I'm gonna enjoy everything. You do that. Where to next, Ben? Home. Come on. Live a little. Joe, Joe, Joe. Everybody. Let's go home. Get in, darling. But I'm not ready to go home yet. Come on, come on. Let's go, let's go. What's happening suddenly? Well, I'll go with you, Joe. No, you go on home. I may have a drink or two. Will you keep that for me? So, good night, you worriers. Boy! Talk about wet blankets! Hey, I'll be fine. I still can't believe I did that. I always liked chocolate. I'll try not to dump anything on you tonight. I mean, I can't promise, but I'll try. Alma... It's the pool. It's having an effect... It's not the pool. It's not the water. It's not the first time. Alma, you're overreacting. I knew. I always knew. I just pretended to be stupid, and I guess I really was. No! But you're the stupid one. Because things have been so good between us. Nothing's changed, Alma. Go home, Joe. Don't make yourself look any more ridiculous than you already are. I'm happy you're going to live, Joe, but I've got to live, too. Joe. Joe. Try to relax. Hey. Are you up for a swim, maybe? Well, sure. The pool! The pool! Can't you think about anything else? If you and Rose would just come with us, you'd feel differently. We don't want to feel differently. We like the way we feel. She needs it, Bernie. We... We should discuss this later. There is nothing to discuss! Because you're a hardhead, Bernie. You're the most frightened man I ever knew. Christ, I don't have to listen to you. If you sit at this table, you damn well do! You think you're in such great shape, Finley? Your marriage is what's terminally ill now! You really are an old bastard. "Old" is right. I don't want to be young again. Your life is a mess because of the fountain of youth! I don't care how healthy you think you are! Sit down! We don't want any part of that goddamn pool house! You can keep the goddamn fountain of youth! No wonder your wife has no use for you. I'm gonna kill that son of a bitch! Joe! Joe! Hey! Joe! Don't! Joe! Joe! Joe! It's next door, isn't it? It's in that pool over there, right? Get to that pool! Get out of the way! What is... Oh, my God. What do we do? Ben? Please, out of the pool. Come on, come on! Everybody out! Come on! Get out of there! We have no business being here! Come on! Out of the water! Get out! You don't understand. We're trespassing. Stop! Everybody out! You have no right to be here. You are trespassing here. Put down the cocoon. I said put down that cocoon! Put it down. Put it down. I'm calling the police. Get out! All of you, get out! All this time to energize the pool. Now the life force is completely drained from the water. I'm not gonna be able to bring them back. When Max saw me in that sweater with the mouton collar and the ivory buttons, he said, "Rose, where the hell did you get that sweater?" I stayed mum, because I knew you stole it. But you stole it for me. Max never stole anything for me, and never made anything as beautiful as that mouton collar. Max couldn't do anything with his hands, except when they were all over me. And you wouldn't even kiss my cheek without asking. Dumping Max was the smartest move I ever made. Bernie. Time for your medicine. I'll get it. Here you are. Rose. Rose? Are you asleep? Rose. Rose? Rose. Rose. Rose. I'm so sorry. Can you help me? I have to do something for her. She... She... The pool doesn't work anymore. It's too late. I'll give you everything I've got. I'm sorry, Bernie. I wish I could help you. It's just too late. Rosie. Rosie. Hello, Ben. Walter. I thought maybe you guys had got the hell out of here already after what happened today. I came by to tell you I'm sorry, Walter. I... I know we let you down, and I'm really sorry. I had never experienced the pain and the grief associated with death before. I've never had anyone close to me who died. Walter, these things out here, can you take them back with you on that spaceship? No. They would never survive the flight. Well, can you put them back in the ocean? Two are gone now. Two of my friends are gone. We don't have the time to get them all back into the ocean. We must leave this place tomorrow. What if we do it tonight? We'll help you. Come on! Bring that one around here, okay? Alma, let me give you a hand with that. There are a lot more. Lay this one down outside and come right back. Okay. Got it? I can't do this alone! Hey, somebody give me a hand. Set it over there. Okay. Come on! Let's go. Let's get a hold of this! Our base was sinking. Time to prepare a passage for all of us was gone. These 20 chose to stay behind so the rest of us could leave safely. They survived here in the ocean for 10,000 years. They can survive again. Okay? Yeah. How you guys doing? Okay. You okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Fine. I've been diving. It's all right. You have? I want you all to consider very carefully what I'm about to suggest to you. You and your friends seem to want what we've got. Well, we have room for you. We have room for you and about 30 more of your friends. You would be students, of course, but... But you'd also be teachers. And the new civilizations that we'll be traveling to will be unlike anything you've ever known. But I promise you you will all lead productive lives. Forever? We don't know what "forever" means. I got a couple of things I... I need to talk about with you. Yeah? Yeah. I guess me and your grandma are going away, David. Where to? Well, that's not important. What's important is that when we get where we're going, we'll never be sick, we won't get any older and we won't ever die. You're joking me, right? No. No. Would I be able to visit you and Grandma? No. And we wouldn't be able to visit you, either. And that kind of bothers me. I'd never see you again? No. When would you go, if you did? Soon, my boy. Soon. And do you know where? Where? Look up. Outer space, my lad. Outer space. Who's gonna take you to outer space? It don't matter. You wouldn't believe me if I told you, and I can't tell your mother, because she'd then know her old man had snapped his cap. I wonder if they'll have fishing holes there. There's some things they won't have. They won't have grandsons, and they won't have baseball games, and they won't have hot dogs, and they won't have that kind of stuff. And... I'm gonna miss them. All right. Cast it out there. I wish we'd get a bite. If I could catch one more great, big fish... You know how much we love you, don't you? Of course I do. I just don't want you to forget how much we care no matter what we say or do. Of course. Bye, Grandpa. Goodbye, little man. Smile. Bye, Dad. Bye, Mom. Stop by next week sometime, okay? Be a good boy. Mind your mom. You having second thoughts? Yes. So you think it's like Bernie says, we're cheating nature. Yes. Well, I'll tell you something. The way nature's been treating us, I don't mind cheating her a little. You'll be closing your account then, Mr. Selwyn? Yes, I will. All in $100 bills? Uh-huh. Here you go. This is for you. Sir! Here. Have fun, have fun, my friends! Have fun! Here. Divide it up, girls! Divide it up! Divide it up! There you are. There you are. Racing with the moon Hey! Enjoy, enjoy! Sailing through the midnight sun He can come in for a minute. Hi. They say if we go with them, we'll live forever. And that's good. It's probably gonna take you an eternity to forgive me. I'm sorry, Alma. I guess I've been ridiculous. I am sorry. I love you. You're my whole life. I want to go. But if it's a choice of only six more months here with you, or living forever all by myself, well, I'll take the six more months here with you. I don't want to live forever if you're not gonna be with me. So, you definitely trust them? We trust them. Men should be explorers, no matter how old they are. I don't know about anybody else, but I'm going. Why the hell not? We're in. Are you nervous? Me? No. You're sure you want to do this? Once I make a decision, Arthur, I never turn back. This is a big one. I know. Yeah, it's gonna be 72 and clear tonight, a great night to see that total lunar eclipse. Check it out. But don't get weird on me, people. Let's go. Let's go. Sure. Quick. Get me a glass of water. Look out. Don't do that! What is the meaning of this? David? Staying up for the eclipse? You don't seem too enthusiastic. Did you and Grandpa have a fight today? No. What did he say to you? David, I'm very worried about Grandpa and Grandma. What did he say to you? I can't tell you. They're my parents, David. You've got to tell me what he said to you. He made me promise. Mom? Dad? Mom? Dad? Hey, Bernie. Come on. You're coming with us, Bernie? No. I came to say goodbye. I just wanted to tell you I hope you find what you're looking for. Rose is gone, Bernie. Why stay? This is my home. This is where I belong. Come on. Go with us. Bye, Bernie. Bye, Bernie. Bye. I'm gonna miss you. Come on, come on, come on, come on. Come on. God... Only when I need it, right? Only when I need it. Jesus... I know something is wrong. They're probably out dancing. Those folks love to dance. Could we talk to one of their friends? We'll go see Pops. Will that satisfy you? Pops. Pops. Got a little game of 20 questions for you. Pops! Shit! Hello? I don't know what's going on here. Jack, we'd better take a look down below. What? We'd better take a look down below. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Make sure you get the feed line. Okay? 'Cause it's gotta be... You got it. Good. The injector. We've got to make the injector... It's got... You got that, too? Good. Make sure... You go house to house. Check the bus stations and the airports. This is a serious situation we got here. The owner of the facility is on his way from West Palm, and he's not happy at all. Why don't you start by taking a good look around the grounds first? Okay, gentlemen? Okay. Right this way. Better advise the commander. Don't worry, miss. We'll help you find your father and mother. It's right over here. We're in deep shit. You know that? David! David! Back this way. Hey, hey. Whoa! In case you're wondering... Silly Putty. Cast off those lines. Grandpa, wait for me! I want to go, too! Grandpa! What are you doing here? Are you all right? Yeah. My gosh. David! A boat just left the dock. David! A lot of old people aboard, a kid, some in wheelchairs. David! We better move on this thing now. I don't like the looks of it. You can't go. Only your grandmother and me from this outfit. This is Air 21. I think I got them below me. Want me to swoop them? Over. Roger, Air 21. You are clear. Manta III, this is not a request. This is an order. You are endangering the lives of your passengers. Cut your engines. We are coming alongside to board your vessel. Jack. Don't let them board us. Nobody's gonna board this boat. You just get your friends here. Captain, cut your engines. Captain, this is Lieutenant Spark of the St. Petersburg police. You have senior citizens aboard who are in no condition to be out here. You have a minor aboard without proper authority from his mother. We want to question you. Please, cut your engines now. We are coming alongside to board your vessel. Stand by to be boarded. David's mother wants him to come into the police boat with her. David! Come on. Please. Mom and Dad, where are you going? David! You come back here! David! Bring it around. Cut your engines. Cut your engines and come about. Man overboard. Man overboard, gentlemen. You all right? I'm okay! I'm not scared! Get going! Let's go! David. Maintain a visual on the Manta. These people must be nuts. We're gonna have to pursue and intercept. We just went into fog, Chris. Rolling out. Re-check speed selectors. Full forward. Wheels up. Speed selectors, re-check, full forward. Where the hell did this come from? I don't know. I can't see a damn thing. I've never seen it roll in so fast. My God! We get no reading on radar. Over. 14X3, we copy. Have zero visibility. We're gonna run into each other. Go ahead. Roger. Let's shut them down. Over. This should more than cover the cost of the boat. I didn't... I want to thank you for being a fine guide and a good friend. All right. Now, you drive careful, Walter. See you, Walter. I guess your ride's here, huh? Look, Kitty, next time you're in town, I want you to look me up, okay? Don't worry, Jack. You'll know when I'm around. You don't know how close I came to buying a ticket. You'd better go. Okay. I'm gonna miss you, Kitty. I'm really gonna miss you. May the force be with you! There can never be an accounting, in human terms, for the tragedy at sea which has taken the lives of these men and women in what should have been the beautiful and peaceful sunset of their lives. Do not fear. Your loved ones are in safekeeping. They have moved on to a higher expression of life, not life as we know it, but in the spirit everlasting. Our loved ones are in good hands, for now and forevermore. Join with me now in a moment of silent prayer.
