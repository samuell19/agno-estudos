Providing I take back the name of Michael Reka. Yeah. No, thanks. I'm John Smith now legally getting along all right. Have a good job that I got myself and I don't know anybody any good. You don't owe me anything r. You don't really think, do you, that I can have the respect and affection for you that other sons have with their fathers shamed of MIA? Ashamed of me, huh? Well, you to ashamed to take the money to pay for your education in Europe. Now, I'm not good enough for it. You weren't good enough for mother either. That's why she left you and took me with her. All the money in the world couldn't pay for the suffering you caused her. Before she died last winter in Paris, she asked me to get my brother away from you. She knew what you were making Oh, you've got a swell chance of getting. Beneticto away from me. He's got brains, and more in here than you'll ever have. I have a lot more in there before he's through. Lead Ah, you're yellow! You pick got your mother's folks. Flowers seven. What's all this getting us. You don't have to go to my racket. I am offering you a business of your own, lots of money. My input. And I don't want any other. I said I was Tony Ricca son when I first came back from Europe. Then I discovered what a horrible thing itwas for people to know that you were my father. When I was a curiosity. My friends wisecracked behind my back. I couldn't hold a job in a respectable firm. Everywhere I went, I was expected to have a quart of gin on my hip and a machine gun on my sleeve. Yeah, well, they didn No or or after I changed my name to Smith either. You say, I haven't got anything in here. Well, neither of you unless you have a gun in your hand. Big brave men, you gangsters, your armored cars, new bulletproof vests. Well, you can even call on your own son without those three American beauties tagging along after you. Gee, but I'm proud of you. Shooting people in the back and spraying the street with the blood of innocent children ... Palmero's mob did that! Palmerra Ah, you're I are all alike. Breaking laws and corrupting justice, your reign of terror is just about over the people who like your methods. You can't scare a whole nation. One of these days, the government is going to step in and handle a whole pack if you cowardly murderer... You'd better get out of here. Before you have to use your gun. [Whistles] Two kids killed, huh?, One of 'em in a the baby carriage. Somebody wanted that Capari guy awful bad to risk killing kids. Mike Palmero's mob did it. Aw, you're crazy! What's Palmerra doing killing his partner's brother-in-law Who say's Ricca and Palmerra are partners? - Everybody! On the surface, yeah. Yeah, I'll bet you 10 bucks the next one takes a ride will be a Palmerra man? It's a bet. OK. I wish every mother and father in town could have gone to look at what I saw this afternoon. But they know more gangsters alive tomorrow morning. Here you are, Charlie What's the dope on all this? Inside war between Ricca and Palmerra. Both want to be boss. Newspaper gonna offer $25,000 for the arrest of the killer. That's a lot of baloney. That ain't gonna get anybody arrested. 25 grand's a lot of money - somebody sqawk. - Would you? One hundred people in the street saw what happened. One hundred people saw that car. And the cops couldn't find one to admit it. They were afraid to squeal. They know their life wouldn't be worth a nickle. Any more on this tonight? No, there's won't be 'til Ricca buries his dead. [Speaking Italian] [Speaking Italian] Mike Palmero and his mother is here. OK, OK. Say Dad, he's got some nerve coming here. Keep your shirt on, Benedicto. [Condolences in Italian] Where is Tony Ricca? Dining room. [Speaking Italian] You can't get away with it, Mike. Get away with what? Who killed my brother in law? You're accusing me or asking me? Suit yourself. I'll get the guys that did it. You can't do it, Tony. From now on, I tell you what to do.

Nice dive, Mary! Hey, don't do that. - Why not? Because I don't want to go in. What you do that for? Joe! Stop it! Have you lost your mind? All right! You've always wanted to get in a swim. I'll help! Say, who do you think you are? How do you like to have some of this - ! All right, boys, get out of here. Take him to the Chief, and tell him what happened. It was a terrible, horrible experience. Good night, Miss Palmero. I'm awfully sorry. Is there anything I can do? No, thank you. [Sarcastically] We're not staying for the fireworks. Thank you. If it weren't for her money, she'd - be hanging out of tenement window somewhere chewing on a string of garlic. Don't mind those eggs, honey. I hate to leave you, but I have to get in touch with the newspaper before some of these mugs talk too much. Thank you so much. Awful gathering. Night, Maria [Chattering] [Chattering] Can I help? Thanks, Jerry. You might tell the orchestra they can go. Say, what's the matter with Joe? I had to sock him. - What for? He got to shovin' people in the pool with their clothes on. Then when some guys threw him in, he got nasty and pulled a gun. Hey, where'd he get a gun? Search me. Is he hurt? No. I was careful. - Put him to bed. I'll tend to him in the morning. Joe spoil your party for you, didn't he? It was spoiled long before it started. Don't you worry, Maria. You can have a party anytime you want. And it's gonna be the biggest party ever given in Florida. And we'll have Paul White down here from New York with his orchestra. Fireworks. Anything you say. And I'll send Joe away so it won't spoil things for you. Couldn't you send me away and give the next party for Joe? [Maria] It's no use, Grandma Nina We're just not like other people. They won't have us. Nobody blamed you for what Joe do. Everybody like you. You know what they say about me? No. I should be hanging out of a tenement window, chewing on a string of garlic. I met a young man tonight. We got on beautifully until he found out who I was. I'll never forget the expression on his face. It was marvelous. [Sobbing] Marvelous! [Phone ringing] Hello. Long distance? Yeah, put him on. I got some very sad news for you, Chief. Tony Ricca's nephew died very suddenly early this morning. Send him a nice floral piece from Mike Palmero [Respond in Italian] I know you don't want to read about last night's party. Sure. Let me see. Now, don't blame me. The League of Nations couldn't have kept that out of the paper. Why did you offer them some dough? - Aren't you dumb? The newspapers are looking for anything to pin on you and you want to bribe one. They think I'll fire you. Go ahead and then see what they print about you. This just came from the front gate. You better sock it, Willy. You know the chief's orders. - What these other girls got - - that Maria hasn't got? - Respectable fathers. You think you can put Maria over like toothpaste or chewing gum? You know being your daughter is no cinch. I wouldn't want the job. I don't want to be your father either. Having me around is giving you a sense of humor. Oh yeah? [Maria] Hello Nellie. [Nellie] Hello, darling. These are for you. Tell Janice to put them in a vase, please. They don't need any water. Yes, Miss. Now, who's sending you flowers? John Smith, who is he. - Oh. That's the fella with the beard. You've seen his face on the cough drop boxes. - I wasn't talking to you. Ask the question, who is he? I met him last night. He came with Don Morley. Don Moreley is okay. His father's a big architech. [Phone Ringing] Hello? Yeah? Oh. John Smith at the gate now. I don't want to him. Tell him to come up. Why did you do that? Well, I think I moved down here? I want you and Joe to meet some real people. John Smith come from a nice family, don't he?. Oh, you heard the Smiths from New York. They're very well spoken of - Shut up! Why don't you want to see him? Well, if you must know, he is the man who threw Joe in the pool And he ain't afraid to come back the next day? Say, I want to meet that guy. Maybe he likes you. Looks like he's interested. - Well, I'm not. Well, I am. [John] Good afternoon. Good afternoon, Mr. Smith. This is Miss Weaver. I'd like to have you meet Mr. Smith. - How do you do? - This is my father. = How do you do? [Mike] Glad to know you, Mr. Smith. Thank you, sir. [Mike] You've been in Florida long. - This is my second day. [Mike] Yes. [Mike] Just playing around, huh?. - No. Working. Who for? Mr. Moreley We're building the two new hotels here. Where are you from? Where's your home? New York City. New York, eh? Well, ah... Nellie, let's go. Mr. Smith didn't come to call on us. Your flowers were lovely. Thank you. There were sort of an apology. [Maria] Don't or I'll apologize for my brother's actions. I understand your brother. He's only trying to convince the world that he's a Palmero. You're delightfully frank in your contempt for our family, aren't you? Why did you come here again? To explain a misunderstanding. Please sit down. Let me talk to you. We were getting along swell last night, and you had to go and spoil it all by telling me your name. We were beginning to have a romance. Fifteen minutes more and I had proposed would have proposed. - When I told you my name you laughed. You didn't realize how funny the situation was. No, I didn't. I bet you felt like saving my face. I did. Why didn't you? You did the first time I kissed you. [John] When we were kids You don't remember, do you? I think I was your first beau. I used to give you candy hearts. Yes. And you gave me the mumps. Am I still a mystery? Well, our fathers used to be partners. - Marco Ricca! [John] Discovered. Alias John Smith. Why didn't you tell me before? - You didn't give me a chance. What do you mean coming to this house? I wanted to see you again. But you shouldn't have come here, you know that. You're not going to give me up, are you? It isn't safe for you here. Of course it is. I'm just one of the many John Smiths, a lowly architect, paying his respects to an old sweetheart. But suppose somebody should recognize you who you didn't. I've never been connected wth my father's racket. Thanks to mother, I've lived abroad since I was 10. You've better get out of here. Our fathers are not the gentle kind that scold or spank. If anything should happen to you... Well, I... Thanks I'm serious. Anything should happen to you, I'd feel responsible. Would you like the responsibility. Don't you. I'm glad you came here and I'm glad to see you, but you must never come here again. You mean you don't want to see me again? - Would you go now? Where do we meet tonight? I'm not going to meet you again, ever. Oh, yes, you are. I'll follow you wherever you go. - Well if you do, I'll.. What? Well, I can't meet you tonight. I'm going to Nellie Weaver;s. - So am I. Good afternoon. No, you simply cannot get away with it. You're playing with dynamite. Now, don't give me that innocent baby stare, you know what I mean? There are millions Smiths, and you have to pick the one by the name of Marco Ricca and fall in love with him. What an imagination. Well, you'd have to be crazy about him or you wouldn't take the chance. All your leaping at conclusions, Nellie. I told you, we're only going for a lark. Yeah, I know a couple who once went for a lark. I'm the lark. How about Jerry, your personal bodyguard? You take him along. Not for a minute. You were going to entertain him until we get back. Is that so? No. You simply cannot get away with it. Why? You're making me a fellow conspirator. If this leaks out, you know what your father might do to me. There's no sex discrimination in this gang warfare nowadays. But I told you, father likes Mr Smith. Oh, that's bad. If he likes him, he'll never stop until he finds out everything about him. He started on the young chap this afternoon. You heard him. He can ask questions faster than a machine gun can sputter. [Doorbell Buzz] There he is now. - Wait a minute! Maria! Come in, Mr Smith. Good evening You know Mrs Weaver, don't you? - Of Course This is Mr Baxter. - [Jerry] How do you do? How do you do, Mr. Baxter? I borrowed Don Morley's car Though you might want to take a ride. - Will there be room for all of us? Well it's only a roadster. - Oh, I'm so sorry. Is there a rumble seat? You don't get me in any rumble seat. Well, I know exactly how you feel, Nellie. I know how nervous, worn out and tired you are. And Jerry never did like to take the bumps. We'll be back at 11:30, Jerry. So you can check me out at home by twelve. Hey, listen. [Cherrily] Goodnight. What's all this anyway? Well, what does it look like? Looks like a frame up. I'm left holding the bag. Oh I wouldn't worry. Mike likes young Smith. Do you really want to go for a ride? - Anything happens to her, I'm liable to be taken for one. Oh, give her a break. You know, you think Marie is pretty swell yourself. Now, don't you? Well, there's nothing I wouldn't do for her. Why couldn't see her in her own home? How would you like to go visit your best girl with a machine gun in every window? Hey, you're mixed up in this more than you're telling me. If this guy Smith isn't on the up and up with Maria, you better leave town. Yeah, if he isn't, we both better leave town. Oh, let's forget it. Let's do something. What's your favorite two-handed game? - Blackjack. Now, that's one handed Play Cribbage? Played it steady once for 90 days. No time off for good behavior. - Say..! Oh, come on. Let's see how good you are. 15-2, 15-4, 15-6, six and eight is 16, and that puts Nellie out How many games does that put you ahead? - Just 64 in three weeks. You know, if you really want to learn this game, there are some expert Cribbage players at Sing-Sing No, thanks. I wonder where those kids are tonight. Well, one guess is as good as another. Florida is a pretty big state. Ths Cribbage stall been going on long enough. What do they do night after night? What would you be doing with a pretty girl on the moonlight? We'd better play Cribbage. Moon, stars... and we're just a couple of little ants, worrying, thinking we're important. - We're important to each other. I love you, Marco, - And I think you're just terrible. Let's face the music. I'll tell your father who I am and that we're going to be married and have a bomb planted in our wedding cake. He'd give us a swell funeral. Oh, let's elope then, run away to Europe. Run away. As if we were the criminals, then the manhunt would begin. Our pictures and papers all over the world tracked by reporters, cameramen, gunmen. Marco, do you realize we can't possibly escape them any place? We're losing our sense of humor. I can't help it. I'm so afraid that father will find out who you are and.. ... and I'll never see you again. Oh, sweetheart. Let's forget everything, but just you and me take every minute of happiness we can get. But it's all so hopeless. Perhaps it would have been better if we'd never met. You don't mean that, do you? [Mike] I know, I know. I've heard all that before. That's a lot of bunk. I'm not advising you as your attorney, Mike, but as your friend. You got to get out of the racket! - Yeah? And let Tony Ricca grab my business?! No, Tony's got to get out, too. His attorneys are giving him the same advice. Ah, don't you believe it! Just a trick! Tony Ricca knows I've got him on the run. You're on the run yourself only you don't know it. Yeah, who's got me on the run? The public. Ah, I'm not afraid of the public. - No. You know what they're saying. Mike Palmero kills children. Well, I can't stop people from talking. - Right. But people talking can stop you. Nobody ain't got nothing on Mike Palmero. They will have before they get through with you. All right. All right. There's plenty time to worry about that - Time? A couple of days maybe. You'll see think you're some kind of a king? Well, let me tell you, Mike, you're riding for a fall. You've just been lucky so far. But take my word for it. No man is big enough to keep on breaking the law and get away with it. People in this country are not indifferent anymore. There were a long time getting on to you and now they've started they will never stop until they finish their job. [Knocking on door] Come in. I guess you're right, Russo. Maybe I better give up this racket You mean it? - Yeah. Now you're getting sensible. Now you're getting smart. Well, if Tony Ricca's ready to quit, so am I. There won't be any trouble about that. Tony'll quit. [From radio] "You will now hear the regular broadcast of late news bulletin. Gangland snarled its defiance of the law again tonight when two fathers of families were riddled with machine gun bullets intended for Benedicto Ricca. son of Tony Ricca, Southside Beerbaron. Young Ricca, mortally wounded, died at the Mercy Hospital, refusing to reveal the identity of the assailants." It's too bad. [From Radio] "Atlantic City, New Jersey. A terrific 60 mile gale swept the waterfront - " You know, Tony's son was dead. That telegram you just got was from one of your men telling you that they carried out your orders to have Benedicto killed. That was why you were so willing to make peace with Ricca. Mike Palmero, you're a disgrace to your nationality. I'm through with you. Better go to bed, Mom. Russo was right? You promised me it would be no more killing. Again you break your word to your mother! - Aw, Mom The Palmeros and Riccas are being wiped out. - When is it going to end? - Well, for me, it's finished. What I told Russo was true. Yes, but what about Tony Ricca? He's not through! His son is dead, you think he will stop there? No. Next, they will kill Joe. Don't worry about it, Joe. I'll take care of that Joe is next! Then they kill you next. Mom, you don't mean that. I do mean it! You're my only son, but I'd rather see you dead if it will stop this killing. Can never bring happiness to anybody in all your life. For 20 years, I've pleaded with you and your own children, no one to Maria is afraid of you and Joe make fun of you. What's the matter? I'm a good father. I give all the money they want to spend, give them everything they want. Money, money, money. What they need is a father, one that kind of love and respect. That's why they don't stay home. They stay home if I tell them to - They hate you. And I don't blame them. Mike Palmero, you are a murderer. And may God forgive me for bringing you into this world. It would have been better if you'd never been born. Mom, you don't know what you're saying!? Don't touch me! There's blood on your hands. The blood of litte innocent children. And maybe someday the blood of your own son. [Skid] That's 10 you owe me. - Yeah. I bet you bumped off this Ricca mug yourself just to take more of my dough. I done it for less than that. If you want to know what I think about him. Here you are, Charlie. I like to see him take every game in the country. Heard him into one pen, turn the Marines on 'em and let 'em blow em to - ! - Phone, Skid. Hello. Well, chief. I want some more on this. - Okay. Play up on the public indignation angle "Enraged country demand.. .. extermination of gangsters. Governor and Mayor confer with the United States Attorney General." Washington Dispatch President ordered Department of Justice to investigate and prosecute gangland crimes against the government and deport all criminal aliens". Have to use this too Burt. Won't would have any room left on the front page. Just came from the Mayor's office. He received more than 5000 letters and telegrams, indignant citizens. More than half of them from Italians - Worked that up "Reputable Italians bitterly condemn... ... hoodlums of their race" - Right Understand everything? When you've done the job, don't come back to this town. Chief, can I see a minute? What do you want? Can I get a statement? I got nothing to say. Your other son coming to the funeral? I haven't got another son. You can't keep it undercover, Tony. How about the young architect? I haven't got another son. OK. So after you leave a school in Europe, the United States looks pretty good to you, eh? There were better jobs over here. I know your family to see you home again. Yes. Why'd you go to Europe? Wasn't the schools.. ... here good enough for you? Not so good schools in the old country. Everybody know that. Now, how would you know? You never went to school. Hey, what's the matter with you? I did too! Didn't I, Mom? Don't tell me you can't even add your golf scores. Say, Mr Smith, You don't look American, they look like an Italian. Well, I guess that's from living over there so long. Maybe your father's name was as Smithani or something like that. He changed it. Lots of people do that, you know. Well, I've been told before I look Italian, but then there's so many Smiths, we can't all look alike. [All laugh] You ought to write for the funny papers.
