You don't know what it's like to be hunted and hounded with never a minutes rest my face is plastered on every post office in a livery stable west of the pecos I'm such a filthy face to Harden you've got to hide me out for a while you owe me that much I'm not sheltering murderers I'm a respectable cattleman You've dirtied... - Don't all that gun. Now get out of here get out before we shoot you can collect the reward ourselves alright hon but if those deputies take me alive I'll spill the works. you shouldn't have said that Dirk All right. Pul him up. Johni. Watch the back door.

Cassidy we helped get rid of a dangerous criminal and so our community is entitled to some of the benefits you get the money and we get your investment what do you say I've talked it over with my partners let you know later now we might as well face the facts we weren't thinking about a reward when we started out looking for Mason were we oh we got it coming to us and there's no sense letting Harden and brass horn in we might have to I've seen this happen before usually when they start fighting about a reward nobody gets it yeah but there's nothing in this town worth investing unless we buy a saloon or restaurant restaurant chan chan idea yeah that would be a great idea we'd make a lot of money with the restaurant with you around wouldn't they haha but seriously haven't you both forgotten something we've always wanted horse a little ranch of our own a ranch of our own Shay but you think it's about time we laid our guns aside and put morning around like three homeless stray wouldn't you like a little peace and quiet a roof over your head called your own nobody to fire you and ride rains on our own land and raise ham and eggs ah you kind of go for the idea huh well you know me happy all I asked you six square meals a day it sounds swell but do you think there's any land around here for sale well we might ask carton he seems don't all the land the valley come on aren't them he's inside but listen if you give me quarter of the ring one will leave him out of it one side ten on me like that he'll come in gentlemen come idea but you proceeded mr. dusty thank you you have reached a decision yes we decided to invest our reward money in the valley good that is if we can find some good ranch land well every square foot of the valley is good ranch land trouble is there's not much of it as for sale about the only place that's available is the kwik-lok ranch that costs about $10.000 $10.000 that's just twice as much as we have no one expects you to pay kay here's an inventory mr. Cassidy that's a nice snug little ranch house 300 head of good stock cattle and plenty of good pasture land mm-hmm $5.000 lets you take up the first mortgage and considering the high price of beef these days you should be able to pay off the balance in a couple of years well if that's true why couldn't would like make a go of it well there are two Whitlock's a brother and a sister is she young yeah trouble is they knew nothing about raising cattle and cared less they let the place run down and got behind in their payments and you hold the mortgage yeah but I was about to foreclose but if you'd like to take up the mortgage ourselves it's yours well I will look at the place over if it's what you say it is maybe we can make a deal fine fine oh by the way it might be a good idea if we found out where the ranch is well it's on the left-hand side of the road about four miles south of town you can't miss it we'll find it see you later goodbye I don't get it Jed I thought you wanted to grab the Whitlock rants for yourself I do want it first let them sink their money into it as long as I control the water rights they'll lose their money and the ranch try it thanks a lot that's what I call cattle country that's good land all right but it dry grass it down drown that stream looks pretty well it out well you didn't expect it to be perfect did you I suppose it was we wouldn't have the fun of improving it no wait a minute yeah I'd like to look at the rain charts before we make our minds up ha ha it'll have a kitchen if that's what you're worrying about so we're just looking father in there yeah everybody home let's go on inside Garden gave us permission I know but I anybody home it's not well with lots of girls certainly knows how to fix up a parlor nice and cozy set aside she's good-looking now what's that got to do with it she don't go with a Rancho Oh miss Whitlock you can bring me my pipe and slippers hey get your Spurs off that couch what happened you all right hi hoppy look what I found chicken I might have known it that's our that reminds me we haven't eaten since yesterday oh this is not a very nice thing to do but I am hungry that's our trouble with you often you worry too much about your conscience not enough about your stomach yeah I'll take care of that right now who are they Lynne you suppose they're Hardens men I don't know but they've come to throw us off we're gonna throw them off you know if you had three hand your Chokey Asaf tur there that's a good one shape it wonderful there's no place like home know even if it's somebody else's boy what are you doing here why MA I'm Hopalong Cassidy this is Johnny Travers and this is California Carlson where are you howdy see ya hard to say assign Noah sent you to throw us out starve us out - it seems oh please will glad to pay you for the chicken but that isn't exactly what we can to buy see Harden told us you were trying to get rid of the place trying to get rid of it I've been doing everything I could to hang on to it oh that's the case I'm I'm sorry we barged in see we have $5.000 we wanted to invest him and he told us this place was for sale I'm sorry I better get out of here sorry about the chicken I couldn't resist it mr. Cassidy yeah how much money did you say you had $5.000 then what do we better lose half the ranch then all of it well what do you mean we'll never get another loan you know it in another month Harden I'll take the place over so would it be better to form a 50/50 partnership with these men all right don't believe your brother likes the idea of us Whitlock besides we don't want to take advantage your hard love no but you'd be helping us Linden can't run the ranch alone and we having money to hire hands so I think we'd better accept three working partners oh you're friends of Hardin or Joe brass gosh hardly not after beating amount of $5.000 reward money well any man who can do that ought to be a good partner yeah sit down Cassidy maybe we can strike up a bargain Thanks probably bad news we've already seen the bad news there is enough water well there's plenty of water you see that the river that feeds the whole valleys got two forks but Hargens dammed up the headwaters and you have to pay em for the water there's Rachel so how you think no flow in that River instead of water none of us small ranchers can make any money if we have to buy our water we can't afford to do that unless we sell our cattle so the whole thing's a vicious circle mm-hmm but they don't pay your bills you take your land he does worse than that he shuts off the water and our cattle diet thirst why don't you complain to the Cattlemen's Association well Hardin controls that too Oh so if you expect to get rich in this valley mr. Cassidy the cards are stacked against you well getting rich is exactly what I have mine I just want a place to settle down Harden's water rates may be a little high but I'm ready to pay a higher price for a little peace and quiet of course I don't have my partner Steve about it how about a Johnny huh oh sure sure let's form a partnership California did you open it chicken fish yes you get a partner now you got three funny that's right well we've got a lot of chores to do if save time we divide them up Johnny you go over to the telegraph office and wire our resignations to the federal marshal all

Cassidy it is my duty to see that the cattle come up to the specifications demanded by the buyers if my herd is the only good beef the valley that's your hard-luck well how can we fatten our cattle on the water rations you give us Oh why argue with him is better way to channel the wait a minute we're gonna sell our cattle if we have to start our own association to do it but first I want to pay off this debt we'll give you a hundred head of cattle for what we owe you I won't take your cattle what are you talking about cattle is legal tender for debts anywhere in the West but not your cattle I want your ranch and I'm going to get it I'm afraid not Hardin I'm calling a meeting of every rancher in the valley then we'll see how much support you have today if he gets all the ranches working together we're gonna have a fight on our hands I don't believe the ranch this will support mr. caste especially when they find out he's a cattle rustler cattle rustler white Jeb Cassidy ain't never stole anything not yet we're gonna see that he does party she came in with a guy's a regular old faith I never would have believed it I had no idea there was any water in this valley yeah huh look at that string I filled her overnight yeah and overnight California becomes the hero says he knew all along is gonna get water you did oh of course we did I just wanted to surprise and that ain't know I'll bet there's a teasing water all over this fan now wait a minute just because you hit water here don't start bragging thirteen bragging hoppy Oh Chavo dodo mean my pal sink a well for any rancher that wants one if drink water we won't charge you much sin well that sounds fair enough see if this works out we've got heart and licked you bet we have here come the others let's get the meeting started ah yeah hej look boys well there's Hardin now with these vigilantes want to showdown it out jolanda's largest to maintain order I didn't get an invitation to your meeting however there's some old business I want to bring up I'm glad you came and brought your gang since you're the subject of this meeting gentlemen this valley has some of the finest cattle land in the country get your stock is dying in your lands blowing away and why all because of one man Jeb Harden he shuts our water off and lets off past your turn to dust and if we try to sell our cattle eat l's us there's no market for them yet he's been selling his own right along that's right hoppy yes and that's true of the vigilantes too oh yes the vigilantes Hardin tells us he formed that little group to protect us from outlaws the maintain law and order and who are the vigilantes a bunch of gunmen hired by him to clean out anybody that gets in his way and Hardin can clean us out two gentlemen he can break all of us one by one unless we stick together we're with you hoppy we'll start our own Association market our own cattle sake our own well we don't need to buy Hardens water anymore oh wait a minute gentlemen don't let caste stampede gentle you hear what I have to say he used a lot of fine sounding words well I've never known a crook that didn't however there's one thing he said it's quite true I did refuse to market his stock I refused because I found out half the Whitlock herd is stolen cattle and I suppose you can prove that statement I certainly can this hide came off a stair the Lynn Whitlock trip to Kansas City last year the stockyards returned it to me take a good look at it mr. Varney there's the original plan the bar v you can see where it's been enlarged to a box W the use of a running iron quick lock and cassadee poses a small ranches friends that doesn't stop them from stealing your cattle you haven't proved anything Harden anybody can mark up a hide and you probably did it yourself so that's your story is it and you won't object if we take a look at the herd certainly not you'll find some of money's can let the waterhole and they've still got his brand on them alright gentlemen let's take a look well in its some kind of a fray my papi well I didn't do it oh I know you didn't but we got to be ready for trouble if Harden has planted stolen cattle and I've heard we've practically got a rope around her neck let's go see there's one go get him red happy yes Wow can't hear nose Hardened brass better than any of us they planned this frame-up didn't they oh well now Miss Lucy no I'm just an innocent bystander on wag your tongue well if you want the truth give Harding a double-cross himself we got to have a chance oh we've known that all along it's yours alright mr. Barney somebody's with him over the running iron so you're the one that was gonna help the little fellow say we'll see that you get justice mr. Gordon but but not your kind of justice you'll have to come with us Cassady I'll see you get a fair trial I can imagine that kind of a trial wait yet we wouldn't even live when we got to the jail whether you get off those horses come on get out there drop your gun you are too that's your horse mr. Bonnie aren't you going to help them sooner you pretty good guilty I don't want to believe they're guilty Miss Lucy but if those men are innocent they should have given themselves up but Hardin would have lynched them you know that he framed my brother today and tomorrow frame you I've got no use for hardness getting either miss Lucy your brother and his partners are fugitives yes and we'll all be if we're siding with them now you're afraid of them oh no we're not we're all fight Hardin if we can get the evidence against him but there's no sense trying to fight him as long as he stays within the law any other way of that held no Susan steeper on the other side they can knock us off like clay pigeons alright leave two men here rest was the ride back to town they might crawl out of that hole and get away what of it they run away they'll only prove the guilt they stay here it'll be open season for anyone named quick block Travers or Cassidy quick bowler you stay here hey they're leaving two men on guard yeah we'll stay here till it gets dark then we'll make a break for it where we go hoppy we're fair game for anybody back to the ranch when I would talk with Wildcat miss hoppy why didn't they include me in this frame-up well my goodness ed because you're not a cattle man huh pass me that will you please you know when you've got mixed up in this oil business you certainly got your head out of the news here you talk you think lindenhof me and Johnny we're really guilty what wait a minute Jenny are you hurt I'm alright we make a bad tire on a dark night shouldn't have come the vigilantes might be watching the house we made sure no one is around before we rolled in we're only gonna be here a few minutes I want to have a talk of Wildcat now I want you to tell me everything you know about it Jeff Hardin and Joe brass Oh what now listen I don't know nothing - hiya Wildcat you promised to go straight oh yes I know but not straight across Harding's path that's suicide look what's happened to you yeah I know and we haven't got a chance unless we got some evidence against Hardin mm-hmm oh well now I don't know whether this is evidence or not but you remember Dirk Mason you know the fellas a killer that you fellas captured yeah what about him he used to work for Jim Hardin oh well that's no surprise what else oh well one of the vigilantes told me that Joe brass had to kill Dirk Mason to keep him from squealing on Jim Hardin keep him from squealing what about well oh and I wouldn't know about that night yeah well that's a great help you can't prove anything on that kind evidence hej wait a minute wasn't it right after that mail robbery the Hardin put Martin in their ranchers cattle well yes the cattle contracts didn't come through Hardin told the ranch is that all the stockyards weren't buying any cows this year and you took their word for it we had to you see Hardens head of the Association so naturally he does all the bargaining yeah but suppose the cattle contracts were in that stolen mailbag Mason couldn't have used him but Harden could you mean to say Hardin fill those contracts himself he must have he's been selling his cattle right along hasn't he you Betty has and he could have told the buyers that all our cattle were stolen and they'd have believed him what about that wild can't does that make sense well anything accuse hard enough makes sense but how are you gonna prove it no I guess the only thing we do is break into his office and see what we can find well that's impossible the town's full of vigilantes well it's your chance sight and we'll have to find a way to get the vigilantes out of town here's what we'll do as little plum portrayed you just nor the town will meet their son Wow listen the old guys a king himself where's your cattle peeping friends I want to see Hart step right inside get out I'm busy I get a message for a year from Cassidy and Whitlock where are they they're ready to give themselves
