CYRIL KIDMAN: We'll get it this time, Wes, promise! [YELLING] This time! [SCREECHING TIRES] [MUSIC - BEAVER, "THIS TIME"] [SINGING] Look at the stars and they're smiling down.

CYRIL KIDMAN: I reckon. WES PENNINGTON: The phone. CYRIL KIDMAN: It's the phone. WES PENNINGTON: It's always the phone. [SCREECHING TIRES] A small still voice, Cyril [INAUDIBLE] tells me that our dry spell may be over. Perfect. CYRIL KIDMAN: Isn't it a bit small, Wes? Just a bit [INAUDIBLE],, don't you think? It's not the size of the track, Cyril [INAUDIBLE] It's the size of the divvies. Hop into the Jockey Club tomorrow. It's [INAUDIBLE]. It's on the wireless. Oh, great. And there, Cyril [INAUDIBLE]. Not a hop, step and a jump away, a telephone. [INAUDIBLE]. Occasionally, Cyril, your powers of observation are truly astounding. Thank you, Wes. Good lad. What a magnificent landscape. Earth has not anything to show more fair. [INAUDIBLE] All we need now is a nearby town. CYRIL KIDMAN: With a pub. WES PENNINGTON: Oh, and a wealthy bookie. I can feel it in my bones, Cyril [INAUDIBLE].. Great gambling's [INAUDIBLE]. SEL BISHOP: You've really made a mess of your life, haven't you, Morrie? You any idea how far you're on account with me? Sel. Claire, tell you brother how much he owes me. Go easy on him, Sel. Oh, I'll fix you up, Sel. Yeah. Here, what with, Morrie? Empties? No, Sel, don't! OK, let's call it quits. You do a little job for me, and we call it quits, what do you say? Shut up [GUNSHOT] [SQUEAKING NOISE] Lunatic! [GUNSHOT] [FANFARE] WES PENNINGTON: The Assyrian came down like a wolf on the fold. Don't rub too hard, Don. It might drop off. Afternoon, Mrs. Melton. [SCREECHING BRAKES] Who is that vision of maidenly delight? It's Dinah Melton, the boss's new wife. The swine. [BARKS LIKE A DOG] Oh, crikey, Dinah. Oh, darling! [LAUGHTER] [MOANING] [SCREAMING] [GIGGLING] What you figure on, [INAUDIBLE]?? The Oldsmobile. Another rag. 899. Oh, you've got to be joking. It's only one year old. Yeah, but I'm not. Cyril-- Oh, Wes! Oh, hello, young fellow. Is this Tainuia? This is Tainuia. Tell me, if two well-heeled young fellows such as Sel and myself were in the mood for an evening of unbridled debauchery, where would we start? The boozer. The boozer. The boozer! But of course, why didn't we think of that, Sel? CYRIL KIDMAN: No idea. - Wesley Pennington. Cyril Kidman. Oh, Don Jackson. [SAXOPHONE PLAYING] [SCREECHING TIRES] Corker. Take it easy, Cyril. Calm down, we don't wish to antagonize the locals, do we? [INAUDIBLE] Soften them up a little. Right. After you, Wes. Thank you, Cyril. [CHATTER] Gentlemen! [BELCHING] [CHATTER] Ale, my good man.

[INTERPOSING VOICES] Hey, we got a photo of your Mrs. over here, George. Yeah, we got your Mrs. here, look at that. These yours? Mm, rude aren't they? Give it back Filthy. WES PENNINGTON: Just a minute, sir, just a minute. - You're talking to me? - Indeed I am. The photos are mine. Is that right? I'm sure the cops would be interested to know that. Oh, Wes. You get the picture? Clear as day, sir. I mean, we're all slaves to the social vices. Others prefer the most solitary kind. I can see your need is greater than ours. I should warn you, it can make you blind. It can make you blind. [LAUGHTER] I thought he was going to belt me. Cops, he's going to get the cops. I don't think so, Cyril. Who was that baboon? The baboon's name is Norman Cray. He's the local bookie. Oh, jeez, Wes! Oh no. That's poked it. We seem to have struck a bit of a problem here, Cyril. Wes, we're puckarooed, mate. Maybe we should try and find another town. No, no, no it's not insurmountable. I usually think of something. There's got to be an answer somewhere. Somewhere, there's some-- there's some-- [SAXOPHONE PLAYING] [SCREECHING TIRES] [YELLING] [SCREECHING TIRES] Donaldo, what a coincidence, me bumping into you like this. We need someone who can show us where to get a good feed. Besides, I have a proposition to put to you. [SCREECHING TIRES] Business is booming, Donald. But we need a bright young lad to take on a sort of trainee. I've got a job. Absolutely, it's yours. Let's discuss it over a good meal, shall we? A pie and chips three times, dear lady. Hello, Donald. Hi. Having a night out on the town? Yeah. Don. You want to listen to Wes, my son, because this is the real drum, no two ways. But my dad will go crock if I'm late. What a proud father he must be, eh, Cyril? Now relax, we're letting you in on something rather big. DON JACKSON: What is it? WES PENNINGTON: [WHISPERING] Ssh, not here. Is that your car outside? Sure is, sweetheart. It's a doozy. You ain't such a dog yourself. Going to the dance tomorrow night, Donald? Oh, I don't know. Dance? Dance, what's this dance? It's out a Sel Bishop's wool shed. Keep your eyes open for me, sweetheart. I will. Did you observe that, Donald? Our Cyril here is a veritable Don Juan. How does he do it, I ask myself, and then what's his secret. Decent mark on a good set of wheels, mate, no two ways. So you come in with us on this little venture, Donald, you'll have enough shekels to pick up all the class talent in town. What would I have to do? Ah, not here, sanctum sanctorum. Hey, Claire? Talk to him. Jeez, Claire. I'm no bloody criminal. It's not as if someone's home or anything, Morrie. It's just one of Sel's run-down dumps. There you go, Sel. Sorry, Sel, it's not much. Business has been a bit slow. [COUGHING] It's just old Pop Simon. I let him have the room upstairs. You don't mind, do you, Sel? They're poor misguided fools, Donald, felled in some foreign field. My dad was wounded in the war. He lost his leg. Ah, a noble breed, the heroes of Crete and [INAUDIBLE] fighting for freedom against the Hun. Now concentrate, concentrate. Everybody thinks I'm dumb, but I'm not dumb. I just like to think about things, that's all. You're not dumb, Donald. You wouldn't be in this operation if you were dumb. She doesn't think I'm dumb. She just thinks I'm funny. Forget the dusky maiden, Donald. Concentrate on the matter in hand. Absalom. It starts with A, number one. Balthazar. Starts with a B, number two. A fiver each way. Cockroach. Starts with a C, number three. Donald. - Starts with a D, number-- - Oh god. I'm sorry, Wes, I'm sorry. I really love her, Mr. Pennington. Well, of course you do, Donald. Of course you do. He's drunk as a skunk, Wes. Will you concentrate? Who's there? What's going on there? Oh, hey Sarge-- Sergeant. Sergeant? Cops! Cops, the cops. Yes, officer, we're just paying our respects [INAUDIBLE] [INTERPOSING VOICES] Go on, go home. Young hooligans. WES PENNINGTON: Lovely evening, Constable. Sergeant! DON JACKSON: Dad won't like this. You are joining an honorable profession, Donald. When I think of all the poor souls who've been brought to the brink of bankruptcy, even suicide by unscrupulous bookmakers, I think of us as wearing the mantle of avenging angels. We're dispensing a kind of wild divine justice. [SCREECHING TIRES] Donald. Donald? [YELLING] Donald? Ssh! WES PENNINGTON: [WHISPERING] You'll need some of the folding stuff for the bets, not for pouring down the throat. Remember, a fiver each way on the first race. Whatever you can get on after that. Cockroach. I beg your pardon? Fiver each way, starts with three, number C. Good lad. The first race starts-- At 11:00. Excellent, excellent. Now get a good night's sleep, eh? Tomorrow's a busy day. CYRIL KIDMAN: Good night, Donald! [CAT MEOWING] [SNORING] [MUSIC PLAYING] Strewth! [SCREECHING TIRES] Ooh, what a cracker, [INAUDIBLE].. Right, let's get a good seat before the crowds arrive. Whoo! It's the chip shop! [INTERPOSING VOICES] [SIRENS] [INTERPOSING VOICES] [INAUDIBLE] There's nothing I like better than a good fire. [INTERPOSING VOICES] It reminds me of the Brits. Battle of Britain, Wes? No, a city nightclub in the 1920s. Some fool girl caught her skirt in the footlights. [INTERPOSING VOICES] Anybody got a light? [INTERPOSING VOICES] How are we going to put out a fire with [INAUDIBLE]?? Volunteer fire brigade, Wes. Always the same, Cyril. They're undermanned, you see. [INTERPOSING VOICES] There's no pressure in the hose. Must have a leak. Nothing but [INAUDIBLE]. My god, there's somebody in there. Pop's in there! Pop Simon's in there! [SHOUTING] MAN: [SCREAMING] Morrie, you fool! Come back! Morrie! [MUSIC PLAYING] [INTERPOSING VOICES] Stand back! Stand back, there, stand back. [INTERPOSING VOICES] Hero. You're a hero. You're a proper Kiwi. [INTERPOSING VOICES] You all right? [INTERPOSING VOICES] Right, get him [INAUDIBLE]. [INTERPOSING VOICES] Careful, Willy. [INTERPOSING VOICES] WES PENNINGTON: [SINGING] Oh, the devil's poison into God's cleansing river. It's of no further use to man, when it's filtered through the liver. [PISTOL COCKING] KID: Senor? You [INAUDIBLE] in the river, and the taniwha is going to leap up [INAUDIBLE] and bite your [INAUDIBLE] You comprend-- you com-- you understand me? Cyril! Cyril, did you see anyone? - No. - Are you sure? - Sorry, Wes. - That's all right. It's all right. Now where's the toothpaste? - It's in the front [INAUDIBLE]. - Thanks. Ah! I'm really worried about that joker, Wes. No, don't worry about Donald. He's seen the gleam of gold. Nothing's designed to make a man more reliable, Cyril. You know, Wes, this is true. [THUMPING] [GROANING] Well, well, well, decide to rejoin the living, have you? Oh, I feel terrible, Dad. By Jingo, if your mother could see you now. You've been drinking, haven't you? And what about that gate? Oh jeez, I'm sorry, Dad. Yeah, well you really take the cake, doncha? I was worried sick about you. Don't come home. I almost had the cops out looking for you last night. Drinking at your age! What's the time? Time? It's nearly 11:00, and we were going to be in that garden by 9:00. [GROANING] Where are you off to now? I don't know. [GAGGING] I don't know what's got into you, young fella. Yeah, I had to feed your dinner to the fowls last night. Tripe and onions, it was. [RETCHING] [FANFARE] Oh, I got to shake a leg. What do you mean, shake a leg? I'm late. Where are you going? DON JACKSON: Out. Well, don't think you can use this place as a boarding house. I'm not. I promised someone, all right? You promised me too, son. [FANFARE] [CHATTER] I'm in with something really big. What do you mean, big? I've got to tip off. Tip off? What are you talking about? Can't tell you, Dad.

Yes, with our money. You could have lost it. Now we took that risk, you see. Yeah. I'll tell you what, I'll split it three ways, fair shares, even stevens. How's that?

Wesley? Yes, my dear? Hello! Boy, I love the dress. Gorgeous! Gorgeous! I lost all my money. Oh, the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune. I need to piss. May I be of some consolation? [GROANING] Oh, I'm sorry. Did I hurt you? WES PENNINGTON: No. No, no, it was an accident. It's a lovely evening. Oh, she doth teach the torches to burn bright.
