Therefore, my health was failing. I went to the doctor with my friends. The doctor suggested that I was not well. He suggested that a vacation would improve my health. But, my boss wouldn't have sanctioned our leave if we said.. ..we were going on vacation. Therefore my friends Nusu and Kabul.. What happened? I'm speaking the truth. I swear on god.

No, direct connection. I saw Aiyyo pooping in the toilet. What were you exactly doing? Were you standing with the hand shower.. ..so that you could clean him? Hey he should be.. I won't stay with him in the same room. I'm going out. I quit. Hey! Hey! He went away. Should he dance? No. That's not a big deal. I want to say that I saw Aiyyo with my eyes.

A selfie. But, she never stops clicking selfies. She says that she'll take these memories with her when she leaves the world. What next? She said that she wanted to travel in her last days and do nothing else. Come. I also thought.. let's put up a fight then. I don't know what.. And you didn't go abroad for your higher studies.
