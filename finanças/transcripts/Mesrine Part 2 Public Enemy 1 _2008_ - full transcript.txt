Ahmed, that's nice suit. - It's a classic. Isn't it Guido? - A classic suit. - Is excellent. - Oh, yeah. - I look in it like a real frenchman. Frenchman? You know how they call an Arab in suit like this? - Do you know it, Guido? - No, I don't know. They say, "defendant , stand up!" good joke. Jacques, do you know what they call Arab in ashtray? No. A wastefulness. Three of them would fit in it. Good joke. - We're just joking. - Don't be afraid. - We are not like that. - No, we are not. You son of bitch. I spit on people like you! Guido, i gave you a word of a man. I promised you! - Your arab word is worth a shit! - Shut up! Shut up! - Come here so i can see you better. - Look, he whiffs like girl. - Shut your hole! I would put bullet in a man's head, but an animal like you, i finish off with knife! Did you want to sell Sarah! For how much? Die you asshole! Well, what you got? Flesh. - What's that? - That's not important. - Jacques, did you get married? - Yes, I did. - Are you married? - I am. Heard that, Guido? He got married. - She's pregnant. - He got married because she is pregnant. Bravo. Enough. Hey, are you gonna serve me finally? Pour drinks! Bitch! Move your ass! What are you doing? Pour drinks! Hey, guys, what's the problem? And who are you? Son of this bitch or the owner? Please, serve them. move your ass! Well, you see. Nothing's happening. Keep playing. Everything is okay. This for disrespect and this for your drinks. - Does it always take so long? - Depends. - 8-10 hours, depends. - That long? Depends, maybe even longer. - When you become father, maybe you'll settle down. - Maybe. Lot of things change with time but me. - Only a few people change. - It's true. - Do you remember Skazatov? - Who is he? - You shot him in his knees, that guy. Oh, Skazatov, i remember. And what about him? A couple days ago he came with two buddies and was asking about you. Were they tough guys? Yes they were. But without my approval they won't do anything to you. Really? So it's cool. What are they doing over there? A child. - Mister Mesrine? - It's me. Guido, finally. You have a beautiful daughter. You the man. - How are you? - She's beautiful. Hi. What happened? - Were you out with buddies and whores? - Yeah, you're right. Wait. Let me finish it. Yeah, i was with my buddies. - How about whores? - Whores? Whores. why would i need whores when i have a woman like you? That bank looks great. Only two tellers work there, but most importantly there's no safe. These morons keep money under regular lock. Jacques, it's a walk in the park. - And you don't want to do it? - No. - Why? - Because i'm going with Guido. - I don't have any choice and you know that. - That bank can be easily robbed. Get in, get out, the same way bunnies fuck. - Yeah, as long as bunnies won't get fucked by someone else. - Yeah. To bunnies! I do it! Prison divreux, 1962. - How are you? - Dad. Did she say "dad"? My little girl. Dad. She said it. I'm dad. Your daddy. She said it for the first time. Jacques... I don't know what to do. - What do you mean? - I phoned your parents and they said... i should go back to Spain. What kinda crap is this? Is this why you came here? To look at me and tell me you're taking my daughter away from me? Sofia, look at me. Do you want to tell me that? I love you... ...you're my wife. I need you a lot. Phone my parents, they'll help you out. Sofia... For them you're like their own daughter. - Will you phone them? - Yes, I will. This is my mom. Mom. She's a beauty your mom. I just got out of jail. I'm not ashamed to say i was there for robberies. And the reason I don't have any references it's simply because... my life was on the edge since i came back from army. And right here I'd like to start fresh from zero. I'm doing this because of my parents, my wife and of course for myself. But most importantly for little daughter because... ... i have a little a daughter. You know, your past is not helping you. But at the same time i feel your honesty. You can start work tomorrow. - Really? Yes. - Thank you. - I'll show you where you'll work. - Sure. This way, please. - Here you go. - Thank you. Jacques, your little Bruno is a cutie. Doesn't he cry during the night? Only rarely, but that's pretty normal. - Does he cry? No. - You're sweet. - Just wait when his teeth start coming out... - Anyway, we'll see. - I adore kus-kus. - You know what, you should open a restaurant. - You're good cook. - Besides, he already has a job with a good pay. - We don't miss anything. - Don't get excited. Sofia, come to me, honey. - Good night. Good night. - Bye, bye. I have a job for you. You wanna make some money? No, i don't. - No? - No, i don't want to. Because of Sabrine and Bruno. I live and support myself honestly. Alright we'll discuss it any other time. Let me know. - Jacques, you got a minute? - Yeah, i do. - I have serious problems. - Like what? I'll have to fire somebody. - But above all... - I get it. - Wait... - It's alright. - Last one to come, first one to go. - I haven't decided yet. - Don't make anything out of it, you're good man. - Don't worry because of me. - So, i'm ready. Let's go. - Jacques? - Jacques, where are you going? - Everything's ok. I'm going out with my buddies. What buddies? You said you're done with it. - Listen to me! - You listen to me! I don't have time for this now. - You promised me that you won't hang out with them anymore. - That's history. Go back to them and that whore too! - And what's bothering you? - Why can't you just stay home? This is the home of my parents! I lost my job! - I don't care whose home is it! - Quiet! You wake up Bruno! If you leave, I'll call cops! What did you say? Say it again! Repeat what you just said! Don't you ever say these words again, ok? - Come here! Open the mouth! - So, kill me! - Open your mouth! If i should choose between my buddies and you, i'd choose them. Remember that. Mom! Take care of daughter. Fat Guido. You think i can't recognize you through the mask? You're ridiculous. - Yeah, sure. - The guy you're getting these papers for... is already dead. - You asshole. Looser. - Shut up! Who sent you? - Chevallier? - Shut up! This is your end. You're finished. You've reached your goal. I found them. - Why did you do it? Mind your own shit. Any other questions? - You killed unarmed man! - Do you recall how you put the gun in your wife's mouth. That's something different. I break. - Do you bet more or you wanna take a break? - Time, time, time... You don't need me to give you an advice. You'll figure it out yourself. - Here! - Why are you throwing away your wedding ring? - She has abandoned us. Me and three kids. - What? Yeah. - Really? Yeah. - Good. You think this is more than three? Doesn't matter. Fuck Sofia. So, Who is the best? Your friend Paul won everything. - Handsome, are you gonna buy me a drink? He can't, he's here with me. okay then. Thanks. - What's your name? - Jeanne. Jeanne? Funny. And I am Tarzan. - My real name is Jacques. - My pleasure Jacques. - What do you want to drink? - I thought it's customary for a gentleman to ask this question. Traditions need to be changed. - I try. I'm ready for everything. - Me too. Really? Yes. - Quiet! Nobody moves! - Everybody put your hands on the table! - Quickly, all of you hands on the table! - I said, hands on the table! Hey, calm her down! Move, hurry, hurry! What's your problem?! - I said, quiet! - Quiet! - Quick, move! - Jacques... - now you're stealing from me? Do you have a problem with it? - You won't get too far. - Don't worry about me. I have what i want. Here is a tip. - Dad, why isn't it working? Sweetie, because the ball and the racket must be this way. - Are you alright? Dad, does it hurt? - No, it's nothing, honey. I'm only injured. - I love you dad. - I love you too. In front of my daughter! What the hell is it! Will you stay together? Do you still want to be with him? - To the end. Yes, of course. If you love this woman, run away with her and come back when everything settles down. Do you really mean it? You think they won't go after us once we cross the border? The police is trying to get you, i won't help you with that. Yeah, but they were shooting at my daughter! I guess there are some rules! What rules?! In this bussiness there's only one rule, rule of the jungle. Everything has principles and moral laws. Get ready. It will hurt. Don't twist, I almost had her. Guido! Remember in the future, this is being used for killing people! Good. Let me, i'll help you out. Bye mom. - Come to me. - Bye dad. - My love. - Be back soon. Montreal, 1968. More, more, more! Good!
