My sister Nandu is an OCD case. ﻿And I don’t mean the normal OCD case that you see in the movies. ﻿She’s a weird one! ﻿Poor thing ﻿For I have taken full advantage of this weakness of hers. ﻿I know -1 know. One shouldn't think that way. ﻿But what can I do? ﻿It’s a manufacturing defect! ﻿I just have this nagging need to steal everything that’s hers. ﻿Well, that was just the back story. ﻿Here comes the real story. ﻿Ishalu.. ﻿Oh Isha it’s you! ﻿KrishL.What are you doing here? ﻿The washrooms downstairs were occupied. So... ﻿make a move. ﻿Am I not beautiful? ﻿Is that a trick question? ﻿Am I not...sexy? ﻿You're very beautiful...and very sexy... I mean, you're hot! ﻿Beauti— ﻿This did not happen. ﻿What!...This did not happen? ﻿THIS...THIS did not happen. ﻿Thank, God!...Yes, this did not happen. ﻿Yes!...Thank, God! ﻿This did not happen. ﻿You know what? It did not happen. ﻿-Ishalu.. .Ishalu -Ooow! ﻿-Shit! -Ishalu! ﻿Oow, what's the deal? ﻿-Oh, God! -Oow! x3 ﻿Go! ﻿-Ishalu... -What do I do now? ﻿-Go! Just go! Ishalu...Where are you? ﻿Ok... ﻿-Isha... -It's me, Aunty. ﻿Oh, Krish! What are you doing here? ﻿Everyone’s waiting downstairs. Let's go. ﻿Wait...Did you see Isha? ﻿Isha? No! ﻿No? Ok, let's go. ﻿Stupid! ﻿Idiot! ﻿Nothing happened here. Nothing - happened - here. ﻿Basically... ﻿My life is going through a so called Mahabharata phase right now. ﻿Meaning... ﻿Whenever I notice a cute guy and start having a crush on him... ﻿He's definitely bound to be a character from Mahabharata. ﻿They all fly off to a foreign country. ﻿My latest victim... ﻿My town’s cricket team’s opening batsman... Abhimanyu. ﻿Do you have any plans to go abroad? ﻿I don't even own a passport. ﻿This one didn't fly off to foreign... ﻿Instead he and that squint-eyed Priya... ﻿You...You... ﻿You’re not getting these sweets! ﻿Isha! Isha, listen to me. Isha...Isha! ﻿Isha, listen to me. Isha... ﻿Isha, please listen to me... ﻿Get lost. ﻿And that's how... ﻿Even before the battle of Kurukshetra could begin... ﻿My Mahabharata phase ended. ﻿Or at least that's what I thought. ﻿But then again... ﻿Hey...Hello! ﻿Who's that? Who's out there? ﻿Bomb!...I'm not at all a nice girl. ﻿You don’t even want to know a bad thing I did! ﻿What did you do? ﻿Forget that... What are YOU doing here? ﻿Bomb without experiencing my full on torture... ﻿You’re probably planning to sign out really quickly. ﻿Well, that's not going to happen. Ok? ﻿That's ok... ﻿What's this bad thing you’ve done? ﻿Don’t tell me you plan to get Nandu into an ambulance again? ﻿Let her be At least for today. ﻿Oh, that... ﻿I...I took Nandu's earrings without telling her. ﻿Where are Nallu and Pillu! ﻿Are you going to step out like that? ﻿Oh, God! ﻿Don't lock it. ﻿Damn! ﻿Always policing me... ﻿-Hey Tej. Hey Goldie. -[both]: Hi, Arjun. ﻿Don't worry, guys. We’re going to rock the bachelor party. ﻿Possible 3 o'clock. ﻿Leave! ﻿Don't look that way... Don't. ﻿Smile please. ﻿Madam, can you get a little closer? ﻿Isha... ﻿I told you not to take my earrings, right? ﻿If only you knew what I really took... ﻿How many times have I told you not to touch my things! ﻿He doesn’t look ready. ﻿Where've you been all this while? ﻿I was secretly flirting with Bawa in my room. ﻿This is not the time for jokes. ﻿Come let's take a picture. Come on. ﻿-Click a picture of us. -Smile, please. ﻿-Rama... -Yeah, coming. Just a minute. ﻿Mom... ﻿Isha... ﻿Oh no! ﻿You are going to go next, right? ﻿Don't you worry. ﻿I'll get you the perfect match within our circles. ﻿I'm not at all matching-material, Aunty. ﻿’ve a lot of ex-boyfriends. ﻿My reputation’s gone for a toss. ﻿How match? ﻿By the way, did you see Nallu and Pillu? ﻿No! ﻿-Hey! Hi Isha! -Professor Uncle... ﻿Hey... ﻿Is that Scotch? ﻿Yeah... Scotch. ﻿Where's your Grandma, Sathyabhama? ﻿Come on, Professor Uncle. ﻿Bomb’s an out of service vehicle. ﻿Heed my advice and just elope with me. ﻿-Oh! What do you say, huh? ﻿You are very naughty! ﻿Very naughty! ﻿Did you see Nallu and Pillu? ﻿No, I didn't. ﻿-One second. -Sure...Oh! ﻿Not all I IT guys are geeks. Some are fun like me. ﻿Bawa... ﻿Why do you always keep ignoring me? ﻿Hi, Teju. ﻿Let's go. ﻿Hey! ﻿First you need to stop your 'IIT-Song'. ﻿It won't play even at a funeral. ﻿Plus, you have four beautiful cousins in all. ﻿What with the scarcity convo? ﻿-Huh! -Oh, God! ﻿Something’s happened. Spit it out. ﻿Krish and his friends are going to the beach for the bachelor party. ﻿But they didn't bother to invite me. ﻿Ooh! ﻿Hey, you are on the bride's side, dude. ﻿You hang with us. We’re family Bawa, right? ﻿Oh, God! Don’t tell me you’re gonna cry? ﻿Right! That's all I need right now! ﻿Where's that Nallu and Pillu? ﻿-They look so good right? Can you believe those clothes? ﻿Right! ﻿US NRI Showoffs! ﻿I thought we were bad mouthing about them. ﻿God! Where have you guys been all this time? ﻿-Let's go. There's an emergency. -What! ﻿I kissed Krish. ﻿God! What a cheapo! ﻿It's Isha who kissed him first, right? ﻿Of course... But he kissed her back. ﻿Hence he's the cheapo. ﻿-Do you think Nandu will suspect? -Hey shh! ﻿If she gets to know...I'm dead. ﻿He won't tell her. Krish is a gentleman. ﻿Yeah. ﻿But what if... What if he tells her like after ten years, during a weak moment? ﻿Nandini, it was a mistake. Actually... Nandini! ﻿Please! Nandini please... ﻿Oh - My - God! ﻿Yeah. Exactly. ﻿OMG. He's a character from Mahabharata as well. ﻿You’re done for! ﻿What? ﻿Forget all that. What do we do now? ﻿I have no ideas. You guys have any? ﻿suppose some alcohol might spark a few ideas. ﻿You also think. ﻿Krish... Mahabharata? ﻿Krish...Lord Krishna! Hello! ﻿Let's go eat. ﻿Take blessings from Grandma. ﻿Come come come. Make sure you don't kill him. ﻿-Aunty! -Bomb! ﻿She's diabetic. ﻿Son the old lady’s got a point. ﻿You still have time. ﻿If you scoot now, no one will judge you. ﻿And if you really do decide to escape... ﻿You’ll have the full support of all the men in the family. ﻿Good luck. ﻿I badly need some alcohol now! ﻿Delete. ﻿Delete. ﻿Delete. ﻿Delete. ﻿Delete. ﻿Delete. ﻿Hey... I'm having a private conversation here. ﻿Cheers! ﻿Who the hell are you? ﻿And where did you come from? ﻿I'm the groom Krish’s friend. ﻿And...I’m from the farmhouse that's behind the temple. ﻿Oh! ﻿So the Baradwaj farmhouse is yours huh! ﻿-The one with swimming pool. -Yup. It’s my Grandfather’s. ﻿Oh... So that farmhouse belongs to your family! ﻿We have a farmhouse too. ﻿Is that so? ﻿Yeah. This is it. ﻿ e stay in our farmhouse every day. ﻿Very nice! ﻿ ﻿You’re the ‘Beach Bachelor Party Gang’? ﻿Yeah. Why? ﻿Nothing. ﻿What you do? ﻿I fly. ﻿I don’t see any wings? ﻿No wings ﻿Did someone cut them off? ﻿I'm so funny, right? ﻿Cheers! ﻿So funny! ﻿Wait wait. ﻿What's your name? ﻿Arjun. ﻿Arjun! ﻿Arjun... ﻿Like the protagonist and hero of Mahabharata...That Arjun? ﻿Yeah. ﻿You better be a good kisser. ﻿hate swimming pools! ﻿The groom and I are not vibing Rama. ﻿Thank God then that you’re not the one marrying him. ﻿Good night. ﻿Dishoom! ﻿What the hell! -Oye! ﻿Never call me again. ﻿And you’re a bad kisser. ﻿-Come on! -Go get some practice. ﻿Sorry Uncle. ﻿Sorry Aunty. ﻿Chill guys. ﻿She’s here. Send him a warning. ﻿Oye... ﻿We’re never gonna be a match. ﻿Why so? ﻿Because... ﻿Because.. ﻿Because? ﻿Because... ﻿I have my reasons. ﻿And what might those be? ﻿I don’t have to tell you? ﻿Tell me. ﻿I'll call you from the beach. ﻿-Nandini. -Hmm? ﻿jLULU|-|- iuipue[\|- ﻿ve been meaning to...I mean... ﻿I have to tell you something. ﻿-Tell me what? -It’s... ﻿Ah, excuse me. ﻿I need to talk to you. ﻿I think I should be honest with Nandini. ﻿-What! -Because honesty is the best policy. ﻿You can't do that. ﻿Guilt is weighing on me. ﻿Where are you right now? ﻿In your house balcony. ﻿Come to the front door right now. ﻿Ok, I’m coming. ﻿You...Have you gone mad or something ﻿Man handling is fast becoming a habit of yours! ﻿Listen to me carefully... ﻿If Nandu gets to know even a wiff of what happened between us... ﻿Listen to me... ﻿Be a gentleman! ﻿Oh, damn! ﻿Hey, what happened? ﻿You wanted to tell me something, right? ﻿Oh! Yeah. ﻿Your...Your hair... Your hair is really really beautiful! ﻿-Huh! -And I mean it. ﻿Ok, I have to leave. ﻿call you from the beach. -Ok, bye! ﻿God! Oh, God! Nandu, calm down. ﻿"aqjeaig 'eqieejg-ipoo ‘Xin qo- ﻿There's no other way out, Nandu. ﻿Your engagement ring is in a real tangle. ﻿Sacrifices and atonements will have to be done. ﻿I'll kill you. ﻿Think of it as a remote offering to the Tirupathi God atop the seven hills. ﻿Say his name with full devotion, Nandu. Govindha! Govindha! ﻿God will definitely remember this. ﻿My earrings! ﻿Do you think she’s capable of cold blooded murder? ﻿Any ideas? ﻿They say you'll get ideas if you clean your room. ﻿I read it on the internet. ﻿Me, the most qualified bachelor in the entire Krishna district... ﻿should be partying at the beach with the groom and his friends. ﻿Instead here I am stuck with your girly-OCD lot! ﻿God! ﻿Why do guys drool over bachelor parties so much? ﻿Oh, that... ﻿I guess it’s a groom’s one last chance to be a free bird. ﻿But according to me... ﻿It’s a last ditch effort by friends to change ﻿the groom's mind if he's away from it all. ﻿[both]: A girls' bachelor party? ﻿Yes! Bachelorette Party! ﻿But Ish, how will this help solve your problem? ﻿We have to make Nando realize that Krish is ﻿not right for her and make her reject him. ﻿And why and how will she get that realization? ﻿The groom is like perfect! ﻿Yeah. And Nandu is already in half-love with Krish. ﻿She's loving all liking and his FB posts. ﻿To hell with the Likes and Loves.. ﻿Nandu’s entire life’s been filled with OCD issues. ﻿During or after college. ﻿She’s not gotten or maintained a single boyfriend... ﻿And so to her Krish looks like Cupid himself. ﻿If she gets out and sees options like biryani and fruit salads out there... ﻿And if she tastes them... ﻿She'll realize that Krish is just plain porridge. ﻿Basically, we have to change Nandu's point of reference. ﻿Maybe we shouldn't be doing that. Especially two weeks before her marriage. ﻿I thinks. ﻿I thinks too. -Actually... ﻿I thinks.. ﻿As her sisters... This is our responsibility and prime duty. ﻿Can we accomplish all this in just a week long trip? ﻿A lot can happen over a week. ﻿I mean, Nandu could get a ShahRukh Khan Just like Simran did in DDLJ. ﻿And if by chance, she doesn’t. ﻿We'll enjoy our very own trip. ﻿I mean, why should boys have all the fun? ﻿Right? ﻿Come on, guys. ﻿It’s written in our ancient Vedas... ﻿That a thousand lies are justified if it leads to marriage. ﻿I’m sure it's written somewhere... ﻿That a marriage can be sabotaged with a Bachelorette Party. ﻿ e will be doing this for Nandu. ﻿Please guys! ﻿Nandu shouldn't marry a man that I’ve kissed. ﻿It's so wrong! ﻿You’ve seen all those Raghavendra Rao movies? ﻿It's a deadly sin. ﻿I'm in a... ﻿'m in a metaphysical confusion. ﻿Existential crisis! ﻿Hey, enough of your drama. ﻿Even if we say 'Yes', there's still a problem. ﻿Yeah. A huge problem. ﻿No! ﻿[all]: Nandu please ya! ﻿Other than the fact that the boys are doing it. ﻿Do you have one good reason for this trip! ﻿Go for a casual catwalk in high heels. ﻿Wearing Ralph Lauren Dior Gucci. ﻿Turn your idea into plans. ﻿Change the mood! ﻿There’s no time to rest, just dance. ﻿Forget the bridal shower and dance in the rain. ﻿Breaks all the rules and have fun. ﻿This is your last chance. ﻿Why should boys have all the fun! ﻿Now we gonna go get some. ﻿Sing and dance and go bottoms-up! ﻿Got a full bottle, let’s party till the sun’s up. ﻿Go for a casual catwalk in high heels. ﻿Wearing Ralph Lauren Dior Gucci. ﻿Turn your idea into plans. ﻿Change the mood! ﻿Sistah you gotto open up more. ﻿You don’t want your guests to be bored ﻿Take a drag and take a sip Move a little and shake your hips. ﻿We won’t let you sleep for sure.

A huge problem. ﻿-No! -No! ﻿What 'No'? Hear us out at least. -Big Mummy, please say 'Yes'. ﻿-Please - please! -Please say 'Yes'. ﻿-Please, -Please, Mom. Aunt! ﻿-[all]: Please! -Just for once, please let us go. ﻿-Come on, please. -All the boys are going to the beach, Mom! ﻿Not ALL the boys. ﻿Boys can do whatever they want. This is India and that is not our culture. ﻿-Not gonna happen. No! -Please... Just this once. ﻿-Yeah, Mom. -Please say 'Yes'. ﻿I saw the itinerary. British Airways. I’ll pick you up. ﻿[commotion continues] ﻿-What’s all the ruckus? -As usual. Everything is normal. ﻿-Please please please! -If your Dad says ok... You can go. ﻿Ok? ﻿Thank God! ﻿-Dad, please say 'Yes'. -Big Daddy, please... ﻿-Please! -We've never been out.

Of course, he left. ﻿-Rama, what have you got me into. -Aunty listen to me... ﻿-Raghu’s gone again. -Thank, God! ﻿Let's just prepare for the wedding in peace. ﻿[all]: No! ﻿What 'No'?

OMG! ﻿He must have stalked some beautiful girl. I’m sure. ﻿Is that so? ﻿You betcha! ﻿We’d better inform the police. ﻿-[all]: Bomb! -Stop! ﻿Udi, hand me my phone. ﻿Here, Bomb. ﻿Bomb, Don’t you dare make that call... ﻿Are you trying to threaten me? ﻿Actually it's all my fault that I even agreed to go on a trip with you guys. ﻿’m calling Rama. ﻿Why’re you punishing us for what Udi did? ﻿I know what you guys are up to. First it was that tall fellow with the phone... ﻿And then you conveniently leave me at the temple. ﻿-Bomb, it was my fault really... -Stay out of this! ﻿[commotion] ﻿-Bomb!... Get the phone! -Let go of me! ﻿Hello! Kameshwari, this is Colonel Satish. ﻿Time just flew by while talking to you at the restaurant today. ﻿Are you free for dinner tomorrow? ﻿My room number’s 403. Goodnight! ﻿Bomb! ﻿Let's not beat around the bush. I'll come straight to the point. ﻿Who's this Colonel Satish? ﻿Look Bomb, you can sit silently all you want. We have our investigation techniques ﻿-pillu. -Okay.-- ﻿Linkedin profile. Colonel Satish Kumar. ﻿Retired doctor. AFMC graduate. ﻿Part time consultant at Omega hospitals. ﻿Hobbies... Golf. ﻿And the Colonel looks oh so handsome in his profile pic. ﻿-So you bagged a doctor huh! -He's a surgeon. ﻿A wealthy surgeon, Bomb. Not bad. ﻿That's all fine. ﻿But what we need to know is... How far has this relationship progressed? ﻿Yeah, Bomb. What did you do to deserve a dinner date invite after a single meet? ﻿Maybe we should call Mom and Dad after all. ﻿No no no! Udi, save me from these she-devils. ﻿Don't involve me, Bomb. This is way above my league. ﻿-You better not. -Okay, dialling. ﻿Fine I'll talk. ﻿I fell unconscious and he helped me. ﻿And then we had some coconut water at the restaurant. That's it! ﻿So you were a damsel in distress and he your knight in shining armour...Hmm. ﻿Look, Bomb. We’ve got an offer for you. ﻿We play by our rules now and your love story’s safe. ﻿Or else, you’re done for! Okay? ﻿Can you untie me now? ﻿Watch my hand! ﻿Bomb, when did you last do your eyebrows? ﻿। don't feel like going- ﻿You’re planning to bail on the handsome Colonel. We won't allow it. ﻿Bomb, it’s not like they’re lining up for you at this age. ﻿One can’t be picky and insist on First class AC. ﻿Even if you get a sleeper class ticket, you’ve got to start the journey. ﻿Since this is your first date of your second innings, ﻿A small piece of advice... ‘Information barrier’. ﻿Tell him about yourself, but not too much. ﻿Be mysterious... Like a puzzle. ﻿And Bomb, don't turn this into a free consultation session. ﻿Your arthritis, diabetes, etc. etc... ﻿-Absolutely NO. Okay? -Exactly. ﻿Once you’ve netted him, you'll have a lifelong personal doctor. ﻿Until then don't talk about his height, retirement pension, assets, etc. etc. ﻿He'll think you’re a shallow gold digger. ﻿6WWH- ■qLUOQ- ﻿Don't mention that Grandpa was GM at Singareni mines. ﻿Guys feel insecure about stuff like that. ﻿And, Bomb... Most importantly... ﻿Don’t talk about ‘that’, at all! ﻿Just give subtle hints that you are still in good form. ﻿Are we done here? ﻿Superb!... Go now! ﻿[all]: Bomb, go! ﻿-Have fun! -Please follow me, Ma'am. ﻿Tell the chef. No sugar. ﻿He’s dressed to the nines. What's the hold up? ﻿It’s good to keep a man waiting. ﻿Oh yeah? The man’s over ﻿I don’t think he’s got a lot of time to wait at his age. ﻿I'm outta here. Bye ﻿-For you. -Wow! ﻿Sugar free. I got it made specially for you. ﻿-Thank you. x2 -Welcome. ﻿OMG! He's wooing Bomb with dessert. ﻿Not fair. ﻿See I told you so. He's a huge strategist. ﻿The old fox’s just waiting for an opportunity. ﻿He’s is in full swing ﻿Bomb looks easy. ﻿There's gonna be a night-out in 403 for sure. I know it. ﻿[all]: Eew! ﻿What 'Eew'? It’s so obvious what’s going on in there. Look! ﻿By the way, I can't take this geriatric ward romance anymore. ﻿-It's almost morning. I'm going to bed. -[both]: Yeah, go. ﻿You guys have fun! Lots and lots of fun! ﻿So romantic! ﻿Isha, we came here to find a hero for Nandini but instead Bomb got one. ﻿Damn! ﻿-Ish, it was all you from the beginning! -Excuse me! ﻿What happened in the bar was entirely YOU. ﻿As for the Store Montage’ well... The whole world witnessed that! ﻿-So don't act so innocent. -Ish, Krish is not answering my calls! ﻿Excuse me, that's my fault? Hello! ﻿This is all so confusing. This trip... ﻿-I shouldn't have come on this trip. -What! ﻿I should have stayed back and focused on the wedding. ﻿Which is exactly what I'm going to do from tomorrow. ﻿-No, Nandu. -Yes! ﻿Just accept that you like Vikram. ﻿Move it down. ﻿-Ish? -What? ﻿Do we need to call an ambulance? ﻿Nallu, Pillu, help! ﻿-What? -Vikram... ﻿God! ﻿Inspector! ﻿Shoot him, Brother. Show him hell! Shoot him! ﻿You can’t do much now huh?... Shoot him! What are you staring at? ﻿Look at my Brother! ﻿How dare you try and cheat us?

Shoot him! -What's his problem? ﻿-He's a nepotism hire. -Shoot him! ﻿Nandu, I think your lover’s gonna get his brains blown off. ﻿He's not my lover. ﻿Vikram! ﻿-Pandu Uncle! -Bro! Why did you shoot me? ﻿-I see ‘Girls’ Bro! -I can see them too. Let go! ﻿-Go after them. -Bro! ﻿Oh, God! Damn it! ﻿Fast fast fast! ﻿-Isha... -Nandu. ﻿-Come on. -The keys...
