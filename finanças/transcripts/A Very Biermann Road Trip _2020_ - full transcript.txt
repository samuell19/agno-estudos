Ruined a relationship, it was the worst thing ever. I would not recommend it for anybody. - This RV trip, and I'm so excited for it, - 'cause we get to see - the country. It's just about getting outside of our home - and seeing - some national monuments And, like, iconic things in the United States and... I don't know. - Who's driving? - Me. - What are you gonna do? - Ride. - Bring a vibrator. - I don't know. - So we're stopping everywhere, - right? - We're gonna stop all different - kinds of places. - We're going to Nashville, - Ohio... - I'm not, like, a roadie. - Louisville, St. Louis, Ozarks, Oklahoma, Scottsdale, everywhere. - Oh, hi, babies. - Hey. - What are you guys doing? - Hi! - Oh, my God, I have - a lot of damn kids. - You guys look like twins. - People will think - we're twins all the time. - I feel like when we have - our hair And makeup done the same, we pretty much look a lot alike. - You look good. - I know.

Brielle has moved back home, - 'cause she misses - her siblings. - You were... literally, maybe, - slept at your apartment, - like, a week. We figured this out last night. It was actually 12 times. - Kash, let me fix your hat. - Come here real quick. - The littles seem to be growing, like, an inch a day. - They're, like, - past my boobs now. - She orders - clothes and shoes, - And by the time they get - to the house, - They don't fit. - Swear to God. - So kiddos, - aren't we all excited - for this road trip? First stop is Nashville. - Get out of the Alpharetta - bubble, see the world. - Instead of flying over it, - we're gonna... we're gonna Really see it out of a window. - We do a vacation every year. We've done a lot of things. - We camped, - we went to Montana. - I think our first trip to - destiny was an RV trip. - There was a lot - of conveniences Within that RV, - have a bathroom, - have a sink. - You know, the kids could move - a little bit. The can kind of walk around - a little bit, - stretch their legs, - And we still kind of make - progress down the road. - I think I've seen enough - of the world. - Not really. - I have a great idea, - we just go there. - We don't have to go - to all these places Along the way. - This is, like, - your last real summer. - Next summer, we'll maybe go - to, like, the beach - Or something, but then you're... - This is, like, - My last real summer, so, like, - I should, - Like, be here - with my friends, right? This is my last summer before I go to college, and I'm spending it on a RV all summer long? What do I look like? - We're gonna relax. We're gonna bond as a family. I want you guys to see outside of Alpharetta. - We're gonna stop - at really cool places, Like, see... see history. It's gonna be fun. - Firstborn, - is he almost here? - Yeah. - Oh, this is yoga. - Go sit on the couch - and watch the iPad. - We're waiting just for Daddy - to get the RV. - Swear to God, Daddy leaves - and all hell breaks loose. - Is Zulma gonna come on the trip? - Yeah, Zulma's coming - on the trip, - And she's a nanny. - Oh, my God. So we can get... ed up together at the KOA! - I don't know what a KOA - or whatever it is, - But when he showed us - a picture of it, It was, like, multiple RVs in some small space. Is KOA like a Ritz-Carlton? - For RV parks, yes. - I'm gonna Google it. - Like, I don't know - What it is. - KOA. - It's where you dump - your poop. - KOA. - What does it stand for? - For real. - Kampgrounds of America! - A campground? - Look at all these articles. "Police-involved shooting at the KOA." - What? - "Investigate police-involved - Shooting at KOA." - "Murder at KOA"? - "Two dead in the KOA." - I've got five things to say about this five-week road trip. Bad idea, bad idea, bad idea, bad idea, bad idea. They're very flammable. - What, RVs? - Yeah. - Oh, I'm not sleeping - in there. - I told you that ours... Other one... my friend's RV, caught on fire. - Another one just blew up - the other day. - Somebody flung a cigarette - outside of her RV. - At the KOA? - At the KOA, - and the whole thing - caught fire. - So, like, somebody - that hates me Is gonna flick a cigarette - and we all blow up in the RV. - No. - I'm supposed to sleep in - the back of this mother... er? - Well, all your kids will survive. - Hi, love. - All right, come on out. - I'm here. - I need more alcohol for this. - Oh, my gosh! - God! - Holy crap. - That is huge! - What do you think? - It's huge. - Is it big? - Yeah! - Is it huge? Big enough? - It look short. - Short? - Yeah. - It can only be so long. - You're gonna drive this? - I'm gonna drive it. - Check out your new home! - Hell no. - Nah, dude, this scares me. Dude, for five weeks, nothing's big enough for our family, like, nothing but our house... 17,000 square feet of house. - Tracey just told me - that these go up... with, like, - If somebody threw - a cigarette at it, It'd blow up in a second. - Oh, my... Tracey. - That's not what I said. They're very flammable. - What, RVs? - Yeah. - Easy, easy, okay? Calm, calm, calm. - Oh, my. Where are we sleeping here? Oh, I call the top. I want the top. - I call the bottom. I call the bottom. It's tiny in the inside and big in the outside. - The RV's stinky. - Oh, my gosh, the shower! That is tiny. - Holy sh...! There's no room. - Dad, Dad, Dad, I don't have a bed. Dad, I don't have a bed. - Yes. - We all can't fit through one alleyway. I think this expands when you're stopped in the Walmart parking lot. - Right. - Tag, come on. - So driving down the road, - this is how tight this is, - okay? So but when we... when we park... - no, no, please don't do that. - Thank you. - Is there another RV coming? - Because we're not gonna fit - on this. - We're gonna need five. - Yeah, at least. - What about when - we're driving, Kroy, Where do we sit? - When we're driving... so here. - We sit on the couches - and at the table. - We play card games. - With no seat belt? - I feel like we're in a bus. - So, like, if some... we're gonna - run somebody over. You can't help but have anxiety. I'm severely claustrophobic. - Like, the thought of being - in the RV And the door not opening stresses me out. - What if we're, like, driving - down the highway And the RV breaks down? It becomes a... ing nightmare. - And you're gonna be cooking here with all this... - Cooking? - I don't even see a stove. - So yeah, yeah. - It's underneath. - It's underneath there. - Because when you're driving, - Everything will, like, - fly everywhere. - This is our home - for five weeks. - Process that. Coming up next... - There's not a beach - in every state. - Yeah, there is. - They have beaches In Alabama then... - Tell me the map. - Mississippi. - Hand me that one. - Uh-huh. - Stop it. - Yeah, we're helping. - What else needs to get done? - I'm gonna sleep on the couch. - Ariana. - I'm gonna sleep on the couch with Ariana. - I don't wanna sleep - with Brielle, Because she's stinky. - Love! - Yes? - Oh, my goodness. I have things to do, love. - So I gotta finish - loading the box truck. - I gotta get - all the girls' totes. - We're gonna go for 40 days. I need 40 outfits per person. So... no, I figured, like, it would fit in the RV. Like, why wouldn't it not? Like, if it sleeps eight, - we should all have a closet, - right? Like, duh. - Kroy's like, "That's not - an option, sweetie." - So the only way to do it is - to rent a rider truck - and kind of do - This little, like, - closet thing. - Is this all my cream, Bloom? - Yeah, that's gotta go. - Yeah, I don't have room - for food in the RV, - Because we have to take cream - for six weeks. - Well, I don't know - if you can get my cream - in every state. - Your cream is sold - in all 48 states. - I don't know. - It's Land O'Lakes. - Isn't it, like, - a northern thing? - No, I can call them - right now, be like... - Oh, well, let's do it. - Call Land O'Lakes. - Okay, ask them - if they're sold In all 50 states. - Hi, you know the Land O'Lakes Half & Half? - Is it sold in all 50 states? - Ma'am, I'm being ser... this is a very serious question, - 'cause I'm going on - a road trip for five weeks. So I have, like, ten creamers, - and everybody's trying - to throw them out, And I told them you're not sold in all 50 states. - So I shouldn't risk it. - Okay, so the bottom line is... - Shouldn't risk it. - We shouldn't risk it. - This is becoming incredibly stressful, realizing, like, what a pain in the ass I am. - I still have to build the rack for your wigs. - How many heads are gonna... - A simple five. - What am I gonna do - with the other four wigs? - Wear 'em. - No, I cannot. - Yeah, I don't know. - Oh, we could all wear a wig. - No. - One more? - Hi, love. - Did they fit the bed? - Or what's up? - Did you make the bed? - Yeah, I have to put - our mattress in there. - You're bringing - your mattress? - You think I'm gonna lay on somebody else's for five weeks? Like, right now, I think of bed bugs. - I have so many things to check off. We have wine storage, food, we have kids' clothes, kids' toys, water bottles, juice boxes, shoes, brushes, hats. - We might as well pack - the whole house And try to wheel it into one rider truck. - Really? - Well, I believe that was when... - How we doing, love? - You're sweaty. - Babe. - What? - You need to change - your shirt. - It's soaking wet. - No. - Yeah, you've been sweating - all morning. - I know. - Yeah, and you need to shower, - bro. - You stink. - Change. - We have a suitcase - that's wide open With nothing in it. - So let me see the outfits. - Come on. We're going for five weeks, so I recommend you have at least 35. Now that jacket is adorable. - I know it was custom-made for Brielle. - Okay. - Yeah. - Okay, so this is one. - Is that for the dude ranch? - You want a cowboy? - Yeah. Save the horse, and let me ride a cowboy. Like, come on. - There's one positive about the RV trip. - It's the fact that me - and Brielle Are both single, and we're ready to mingle. - Hopefully we can find... Two brothers. - Oh, - what is that little number? - This is for me - when I find a man. Hopefully, I'm wearing this. - Hopefully, - you're wearing this, actually, - So that you can find - a good one. - I feel like all these - different places - We're going to is gonna - give us So many awesome options. - Yeah, we could fall in love. What if I fall in love in Missouri, and then I gotta move to Missouri? - That I will not be doing. - I just wanna know, like, - did you go on any trips - as a kid? - Yes, every spring break. - Why don't we go to - a bunch of different beaches? Let's change the trip. - Well, maybe we can go - to one in Los Angeles. - We should visit every... We should just drive all... - There's not a beach - in every state. - Yeah, there is. They have beaches in Alabama. Then... - Let me... tell me the map. - Tell me all about it... - Mississippi. - Tell me... - There's a beach there. - Obviously, there's not a beach - in every state, - But there's a beach - in most states. Texas has a beach. Ohio has that great lake, - and I know there's a beach - there. Missouri, I'm pretty sure... - Oh, no, no, no. We need to go back. The great lake in Ohio? - Are you thinking - of the Great Lakes? - Uh-huh, yeah, - the Great Lakes. So get to packing, - 'cause I have a lot of work - to do, - And I have to pack - for the littles. Just pack and let's just roll with it. Coming up next... This thing makes me nervous. I think we should just try to go, like, 25. Yeah. - All right, let's go, bring everything to the RV, everybody! You could definitely fit - one more in there, Bloom. - No, I can't. - All her wine's in it. - All her wine - and all her water. - All right, now I'm done. - God, I thought that was - your wig about to fall off. - Oh, my God. - We're stopping in Nashville, - because it's one Of my favorite cities of all time. I love it there. Country music, the food, the culture... I mean, It's definitely something I want my kids to see. - You need all this potion? - Yeah, dude, think - I'm 'bout to start saging This one right here. - Sage every corner. - Yeah, I'm gonna. - Come on. - Wait, sage me, sage Bloom. - Sage. - Sage, sage, sage, sage, sage. - Sage my phone. No negativity. - Sage gets rid of negative energy. So I want to put this RV in the Biermann energy. I would normally, like, smoke it out with sage, like I do my house every week. But, like, I know RVs blow up, - so, like, - we're not gonna risk it. We're just gonna spray it. - RVs don't blow up. What? - Okay, I have to sage everybody and your beds. This is gonna go in the center of the RV. - Okay, so can we carry it - together on the bus so we can - See where it's gonna go? - Yeah. - What's that? - It's a treadmill. Okay, grab the whole thing. - I just... it's very heavy. - Be a man. Ready? - So you leave me - with the heave end. You're supposed to be the man in our relationship. - Watch your step. - Come on. - Come on. - Put it right here... - We're not even supporting Any part of it. I'm holding the whole thing. No, I got it. Now what... wait. - Oh, my God. - You guys are so weak. Oh, Jesus Christ. - Take it. - I got it. - I got it. - No, I got it. - I got it. Ariana will be our tester. - I'll be tester. - Okay go. Ahh, yes, girl. Whoo! Go on. Go on. - Got 'em. Got 'em. - Look like a large - credit card. - Right, great, genius. I paid $500 for this? It sounds like a crying dog. - I think we should all get a photo in front of the bus. - Ooh. - Hey, girls, FYI, we need help. - FYI, - we're doing something. - Homework. - Hold on, kiddies. Let's go. Whoo! - I'm glad you're driving. - So I drove an RV a couple years ago on our way to Destin, but this one is much bigger. - It's as large as you can drive - without having to have A special license or special training. - That's scary and some bullsh... - Finally leaving. - Whoo! - Whoo! - First stop is Nashville. - And then we're gonna go see my Aunt Lori in Ohio. - See you in five weeks. We love you. We love you. - We're out. - Comfy over there, - baby? - Yeah, this is great. - You're looking good. - I'm exhausted. - There's no turning back now. - Let's rock and rumble, Nashville. Whoo! - Ohh. - What was that? - The wine? - It's in a drawer - or something. - Dad? - Huh, baby? - Did we forget our mix? - Oh, damn it. - Can we play? - No, Kane, I picked three. - Ahh! Ahh! - The first ten minutes - in this RV, like, It's chaotic, but, like, I'm already signed up. - I've already packed - everybody's sh... I'm hoping for the best. - I'm so proud of you. - No! - We're gonna stop at - Olive Garden and get dinner Real quick to go, okay? 20 miles into our trip, - we have to pull over - and get dinner. - I mean, let's be honest. - We do like to eat. - Dad, are we almost there? - This thing makes me nervous. - It does? - Yeah, I don't like this. - Why? - The window's too big. And that wheel looks a little loose. - This? - Yeah. - It seems very unstable to me. - It's got good steering - control. - It's just... cars, if they pull out in front of you and sh..., like, it's just too much to stop. - The... the wheel is, like, - this is, like... the whole time. - Right. - The brakes sound like they're gonna give out. - This is like a freight train. - Like, it will plow - right through 'em. - Kroy, is it okay if we all sit on the same side or no? - Yeah, that's not a boat. - No, Kroy, they cannot be all - on the same side. - That's scary. - Yeah, it's fine. - It's the scariest thing ever. My God. It's so scary. - Yeah, I... I see it. Stop.. - I think we should just try - to go, like, 25. Yeah. - We're falling in. - -, - I need a drink. The RV for me is a struggle. Like, I realize that whenever the RV is moving, - I just feel like - I'm gonna die. - We didn't say that, Kroy. - There's only enough room - on the RV for our family. So we're gonna have to find some hotel rooms - at each destination - for Tracey and Zulma. - And Kim. - First night on the RV is a go. Wait, pour me a glass. - Pour me a little bit. - We're gonna split it. - Whoo. - Cheers, bitches. - Cheers.

Cheese. - Cheese. - RV chronicles, baby. - Yeah. - I have a lot of anxiety about this trip, - but, I mean, - the littles are having fun. Brielle and Ariana are having fun.
