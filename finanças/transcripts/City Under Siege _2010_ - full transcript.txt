1945.8 British Malaya (Malaysia) You bastard! What have you done? Sorry, sir. We've doubled the dosage this time. I think... it might be overdosed. Please forgive us! You're good for nothing. To win this war... we have to make those captives our warriors. The experiment has to be successful! Yes! World War II, the day before Japan's surrender Japan's biochemical laboratory was destroyed by the British. Since then it's buried deep under the ground... Ladies and gentlemen Tonight, the show of Thunderbolt Circus now begins Firstly, please welcome... How can I forget that... Who is it? Right... Please welcome our gorgeous Yao Li and handsome He Jun. They are going to perform the amazing nine-section whip. And everybody, here comes the most exciting part of the show for you. He's the renowned King of flying dagger. He's going to show you his breath-taking flying dagger skill. Please don't blink. Because his flying dagger is so fast that it could hardly be seen. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome, the King of flying dagger. It's me. Twin-dagger Sunny. Uncle Tat, Sunny is messing around. Everybody. I'm the world-renowned, invincible... one and the only, the master of flying dagger and the descendant of Swordsman Li. I am the renowned merciless flying dagger that never misses its target, Twin-dagger Sunny. Are you all very excited? We are in trouble, he gets mad again. Okay, hold this apple. Don't be scared. I'll pay you more after that. Like this, a bit higher. Alright, a little bit closer. Okay, relax. I wouldn't care Everybody. Call ambulance. As the flying dagger goes... it's impeccable. Give me one more chance. Just once. Stand over there. What the hell! You bastard! Are you messing up again? I'll fix you up later! I'll pay you shortly. What the hell... alright! Come on, just show me how good you are. You're in trouble, you're dead meat. You really piss me off. I'll fix you up at the backstage in a while. Come on, go ahead. Ladies and gentlemen, this is the real "King of Flying Dagger"... Cheung Tai Chu! Excuse me... Excuse me, please let me through. Come... have a seat. Chu, two new girls are here to be your companions. Uncle Tak. I don't understand why you have to keep this kid. He's out of his mind, he'll get you into big trouble. What's more, his father died many years ago. Thousand flying daggers? Shit! Bro Chu, I didn't fool you. I just tried to perform flying dagger. Kid. If you ever fool around, I'll kill you with my sword. Don't be mad. Just go and have fun. Let's go. Cheer up! Let me go. I can't take it anymore... Let me treat you dinner. Why are you still there? Chu hides a dragger behind his smile. Just stay away from him. Otherwise, he'll torture you to death. Don't stay here, you should go back to HK. I won't go. I only want to perform flying dagger, but you never let me. So I seek chance to practice by myself. Practice? Flying daggers? I watch you grow. How can I not know of your talent? I keep telling you that you have no talent for flying dagger. Stop thinking about flying dagger, okay? You screw up every time... I also put up with that and let you work here as a clown. If your parents didn't ask me to take care of you... I'd have kicked you out long ago. Please give me one more chance. Stop it, that's it. I really can do it. No way. I really can do it. You can't. I can. What can you do though? You can do nothing! You neither exercise flying dagger well nor be a man. You fail in anything! Feel with your heart. Aim with your eyes. Exert with your stamina. Stamina has to combine with wind. You have to befriend with wind. Let wind go along with your flying dagger. Son, you can do it. Do I really lack talent in practicing flying dagger? Someone is gold digging on that hill, we're gonna make a fortune. Really? I didn't lie to you, that's what I heard. Show me the way, go! Notice: No entry in restricted area. Bro, here they are. They talked big when in the bar. They said they bought the treasure map with all their properties. They also said the treasure is the gold bars that the Japanese left during the war time. We're making a fortune. Honey, if we get the gold bars, we will leave the circus for good. Honey, I'll hire 10 maids to serve you. I'll travel around the world with you. 10 maids to watch over me, so that you can fool around? Honey, how would I dare? What wouldn't you dare though? We will worry no more for the rest of our lives! Don't panic Let's go inside. What a shame! Fell off from such a low place. It's lucky that no one finds out. It looks higher over there. I'll go and check that side. Hey! Bro Chu! So many people are here, is it for a campfire party? It must be fun, right? They got drunk so early? I practiced handspring there. Almost... I felt dizzy. I can't see anything. Since you're here, that's our fate. Well, Bro Chu will give you a chance. Let's share the good together. Come on. It's so dark, what a big dark hole... Any ghost? Monster... What monster? It's just human bone. Human bone? Does man have such a long spine? Look at the skull, it's as big as a rice-cooker. And the claws... Are we discovering alien? No matter what it is, it's dead already. Needless to say come over... Let's find out if there's anything ahead. Hurry up! Is there any road ahead? Yes... there is a way. Get going! No way! Amida Buddha... Bro Chu... It seems that many people died here Let's go. Shut up! Are you a mute in your previous life? You'll die right here if you keep talking! Do not open. Honey, what's that? So many... I don't know neither. Open it. I told you to open it! Shit! I just sprained my arms. No strength... what should I do? Bro Kan, you are the strongest, you do it. Bro told you to open it. Open it! What happened? Suddenly it's alright now... It's okay now. Are you okay? Yes. Are you sure? It's fine. Open it. Alright... How'd I open it? God bless... Gold bar! Honey, gold bars! Really? I can't believe my eyes. It's real! It's real Bro Chu, we make a fortune! Kan, take Sunny there... to keep watch. Keep watch? Go! We can really travel around the world. Check quickly if there's anything else. Bro Kan, in fact... ...no one is here. What'd we keep watch for? Honey... Honey, let's run! Run! Bro... Bro... Bro... Bro, run! Quick, hurry up Once we arrive HK and sell the stuff out, we could enjoy our lives in comfort and happiness. What's wrong with you? How didn't you know someone is on board? Bro, why does he look like that? It seems like that he catches contagious disease What should we do? What should we do? We can't let others know about our stuff. Throw him into the sea! Son, life is just like flying dragger, you must have a target. Son, focus on your target, and persist in it. And never give up. What happened? Help! I'm starving... Is anyone here? Hello? Anyone's here? Anyone's here? Anyone's here? I'm starving... I'm starving... I'm starving... Salted fish? Whatever... I'm gonna take it first. Yummy... Hey! What are you doing? Stealing things? People, come and help! There's a thief! Help, can't let the God damn fatty leave I'm not a thief... I'm just too hungry... I'm not a thief... I'm just too hungry... I'm just too hungry... Sorry... Don't you ever come to our village again, Dare to come again, I will beat you up! Stop the car... Stop the car! Stop the car! Sir, the tyre of my car is broken Do you have time to fix it for me? Okay... Hey, you jumped into the sea? No. You got robbed then? No. So why are you alone and completely wet late at night? I just went swimming. Swimming? With clothes on? Do you have an ID card? If you don't, I'll take you to the police station. No... Please don't... I have my ID card. My name is Li Fei. I'm the renowned merciless flying dagger that never misses its target, Twin-dagger Sunny. What an exalted title? Yes. I'm from the Thunderbolt Circus... a flying dagger performer. Should I take you to hospital? No need. I don't understand why I got so fat suddenly. Perhaps you'd better take me home. Well, you are so nice... how should I address you? I'm Angel. The name suits you. In fact, I know you I've seen you on TV. You're the beauty of the news. The cookies are delicious Thank you, Angel Angel... In fact... I'm not that fat. I'm quite skinny. No one would care if you jump into the sea again. Thank you so much. You're welcome. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Uncle Tak! Uncle Tak! Why haven't they come back yet? What is it? Robbery! Good evening, everyone. Here's the news headlines, I'm Angel Chan. Around midnight yesterday, an armoured car got robbed at Wang Tai Road in Kowloon Bay. And the cash loss is more than 5 million dollars. At the same night, at Wan Hoi street in Hunghom, a jewellery factory was robbed as well. There was a gun fight at the scene. There's no trace of gun shot on the injured police officer though. He would probably get hurt by some hard objects. For this robbery at the jewellery shop, Purportedly the criminals didn't shot at all. They took jewellery with an estimated value of over 30 million dollars. According to the witness, the robbers are 3 guys and one girl with terrifying and strange appearance. It is similar to those previous robbery cases. For the sake of confidentiality, the police refused to divulge further details to the public. It's been the 8th robbery case within a week. But strangely in those crime scenes they also found... What weapon did they use? No weapon. Then this bullet-proof glass is... They said the robbers punched the security guard and his body hit on the wall and the glass got shattered. Probably not. Inspector Tong This is Professor Yu from the Biochemical Research Center. And the two behind are experts from mainland. Suen Ho and Ching Shau Wah. They did arrest criminals with supernatural power before. Just let them take control. Suen Ho, we count on you. After the case is closed... you will be paid double. How's that? Much powerful than the last one. So what? Old man, look at this diamond ring... it's much bigger than the one we ordered. Take it then. After all, it's been robbed, the police would not notice if one more goes missing. We are getting married in a month. Do you want to marry me in jail? I don't need a month. I will get them in 20 days. And I'm gonna marry you right after that. Hello! Why don't you call me before coming here? In James' circular, my assignment is in paparazzi next week. Why is that? Mr. Lam lodged a complaint about being defamed in your interview last time. He sent us legal letter. Boss needs to find a scapegoat. He only complained that after 2 years? Listen to me first. Actually, you are lucky for not being fired. Those rich people like to mess around, we can do nothing about that. Right? KK, don't lie to me. Tell me the truth. Are you sure? OK The company wants to put effort on the new talent, so we let you take a break. That's it. New talent? Yoyo? Yes. There's nothing I can help. It's strictly business. You had been new once. When you got promoted, you kicked away others too. The company only aims at the biggest return. She has been working here for only 2 months. Yes. She's inexperienced. She can't even speak clearly. But... Frankly speaking, and don't get mad. She's younger than you, and she has a more charming smile. Audience like her. I'm satisfied with that. You are even more pleased with having sex with her, right? Even if it is true, so what? Angel, you are out-dated. Isn't it better if you leave now? At least some audience would remember you as the beauty of CSS news. Also... I want you to know that love affairs is something out of control sometimes First, I dump you. Secondly, I quit. Don't ever come to me anymore! Honey! Why don't you call me before coming here? You'll regret for doing that. So painful... Uncle Tak! Uncle Tak! Uncle Tak, I'm Sunny. I'm back to HK. Why haven't you guys come back yet? Bastard, what did you do? You guys are on the wanted by the Malaysian police. All our stuff got detained by them. I don't even have spare underwear to change! I've nothing to do with that. Bro Chu and his squad did that. I already told you not to hang out with them. Uncle Tak, I... I'm so scared... I think something is wrong with me. I'm so skinny. You have been skinny though. No, I was very fat last night. What the hell are you talking about? And... I saw mosquitos flying slowly. Are you nuts? It's up to you, going to police station or hospital. What for? The police will get me anyway. You didn't do nothing, why should you be scared? Hurry up and report that to the police. Oh... Bye-bye. Try to bite me? What's going on? Run! Run! It's dangerous here! Run! You! Run! Stay aside Sir, what happened? I want to report a case. The station is in trouble, and you want to report a case now? Go to somewhere else, hurry up! I could endure it no longer. Yes. Someone is holding a policewoman as hostage. 1... 2, there're two lying on the floor. No way! How can you see that at such a long distance? I can see that clearly. Don't shoot, his gun is tied up with the hostage. We hit the criminal, hostage is in danger too. Should I kill her to make you believe? Snipers stand by, open fire when you got a chance Damn the police! All get out of here! Get out! What happened? Angel, something happened! A criminal took police's gun and got hostage. We are together. Okay, let's go Angel? Yes Don't you recognize me? I'm Sunny! Which Sunny? Sunny the Twin-dagger! I'm the fat guy that night. The skinny one. Why haven't the car arrived? Stop bugging me, someone died. She's still alive, don't worry. That policewoman seems to be out of breath. You can see that? That criminal is holding a gun pointing to the policewoman's head... The neck is strapped with tapes It's very dangerous The policewoman... is going to die! Freeze! Freeze! Who took the shot? Sir, we didn't shoot. Seems like a stick Follow me! James, pass me the camera. Catch it! Angel, go! I'll stop them. You recognize me? Lots of people know you now. Can you do me a favour? Okay, what is it? Please do an exclusive interview for me. In your case, it's a rare genetic mutation. Your cell division goes faster than that of ordinary people for a few folds. And it keeps changing. Your cartilage tissues keep proliferating. No bullshit. I just wanna know... when I will turn back to my original form. Bro Chu, you said... you and your friends got infected by biochemical toxin. I guess I have to know the composition of the toxin so as to find out a solution. In fact... I really have no cure for your case. Please let me go. I got a family to feed... Bro, come and have a look. A hostage-taking case took place in the police station this morning. And the policewoman under hostage is already released from hospital after treatment. The criminal who kept the policewoman as hostage was injured on his arm, and he's charged by the police. As captured on the camera, the nameless hero who rescued the hostage with a stick is not yet identified. He didn't die! Tell me. He got infected like we did. Why is he doing fine though? Why isn't he affected by the toxin? Different bodies react to the toxin in different ways. Maybe he has antibody to that. You killed my little brother. But you didn't die... and your look even didn't change a bit. Hello, everybody. I'm Angel Chan. In this period of endless robberies, finally a nameless hero stepped forward. He used a stick to resolve a hostage-taking incident. He rescued a policewoman. He's now right next to me. Let him introduce himself. Hi! Hello, everybody. I'm Li Fei. Or call me Sunny. Nicknamed Twin-dagger Sunny. Twin-dagger Sunny, when I first heard this name... I knew your skill is exceptional. With your talent and the setting here... Is your job related to martial arts? Here's not about martial arts though. Here is the practice area of a circus. I travel with this circus and perform around the world. What about your flying dagger skill... who taught you that? My father taught me that. My father is the 26th descendent of Thousand flying daggers. The merciless flying dagger that never misses its target Where's your father now? He passed away. But it's okay. As my father told me... Life is like flying dagger, As the flying dagger goes... it must hit the target. Can you show your flying dagger skill to our audience? Relax, just take it as your ordinary performance on stage. Alright, I'll show it to you all. I'd like to see your flying dagger skill though! Bro Chu! Angel? Hello, Angel I'm your die-hard fan. Can we be friends? I've to deal with my family affairs first. Sunny... Why do you look the same? Bro Chu... You haven't changed much either. Quite smart. What did you eat? Salted fish. Cookies. I got fat and then slim again... I vomited and got diarrhoea. And then... I'm fine. Isn't it amazing? Now, be good... come with me. I won't go. Come with me! Run! Why is he so fast? Help! Angel! Angel! Sunny... I dreamed of my brother again last night. He told me that he died miserably. He slipped and fell to his death. Bro Chu... It's not my fault. I saw you beat my younger brother to death I think god wouldn't be that unfair. He granted us power but turned us into freaks. And he's so biased towards you. Old man, they are evolving fast. It's phase 2 now. So what? Fortunately... Fate sends you here to make us perfect. Your blood... would be our antidote. Bro Chu... don't act recklessly. You are not going to drink my blood? Let me tell you a secret recipe... Listen... Astragalus root, 4 taels... Chinese yam, 2 mace... Fritillaria, Bellflower root, Loquat half catty each... If you like sweet, you can add 2 candied dates... No candied dates... The most important is the way of cooking! Help! Got anaesthetized and you're still tough. Old man! Hit his acupuncture point! Cheung Tai Chu! Don't force me! Sunny... Sunny! Old man. I think Sunny is not with them. He's not a bad guy. So what? As long as they are of the same kind. We have to make him tell where the other freaks are. Get me a slow motion shot. Okay, just right here. Right, keep shooting down... Take a freeze shot here. OK I make clear to the public that there's no mutants. Please don't make any wild guess for fear that it will raise public anxiety. Excuse me, how do you explain the pictures and clips that we took? I repeat, there's no mutant. The police force will get the suspect with full force. Is the police force able to deal probably with those people? Officer Hong, look. Where did you get this? Sunny's case is so strange, I've never seen that before. His blood contains strong biochemical toxin. But it didn't affect his cell tissues. In fact, it boosts his power to a level multiple times higher than ordinary people. I think his antibody neutralizes toxin in his body. I compared Sunny's preliminary report... with the one of He Jun, the suspect who got killed. I found that there's no obvious mutation in Sunny's muscle and joint tissues. In other words, he's an extraordinary guy. But Sunny is a mutant after all. He would be a threat to the public to a certain extent. I suggest to detain him indefinitely for further observation. Until when? It's not a solution. He is on every headlines now. The public would think that Sunny... is a public hero who punishes criminals and beats mutants. To detain a hero, how could we explain to the public? Miss Angel Chan just proposed a good suggestion. Just listen first. I think since we can't hide our hero, Sunny. Why don't we comply with the public opinion... and put him as an embodiment of justice, or the saviour. Including shows, ads and spokesperson. I'm experienced in media. I could be his agent. It'd be advantageous to the police force, Sunny as well as rebuilding the confidence of the public. I think... she will take the biggest advantage. I personally agree with Miss Chan's suggestion. We shall act immediately. Strike while the iron is hot. So I hired Miss Chan as my consultant. Sir, I think it's quite a good idea. In fact, those experts that we hired couldn't help us in getting those mutants. From now on, you two should do your best in helping and protecting Sunny. Who do you think you are to give us order? Old man. Let's go, we quit. Okay! We'll cooperate with the police in their operations. The merciless razor that never misses its target It would root out all the opponents. Cut! One more time! Mutant? Being a super hero, I have to attend those networking parties so often. And have to run and chase all over, how can I spare time to take a break? Luckily I got Diarrheal Killer! Without it, I cannot manage to fight against the mutant if I got a stomach-ache at the same time Diarrheal Killer, cool! Mutant... Stop! How did I do? It's good I think so. But we're in a hurry, let's go. Take it. Take it. Twin-dagger nasal decongestant. Sugar, egg, right. After pouring in all the things... Okay, just stir it thoroughly. It's awesome! Get up. Go! Go! Go! Go! Go... Sunny... Oh... Yeah... Oh... Thanks! Sunny means that... after getting this prize, he'd do his best. He'll always be your Twin-dagger Sunny! Old man, tell Officer Tong. They're ready to take action. No, I've been waiting for them. You've been restraining your temper these days, Because you wanna use Sunny as the bait? You finally got it. But... Tai! Perhaps you don't need to use flying dagger to kill pests. Use "Super Mutant Killer". Just spray it over all the pests and even mutants will get killed instantly. Super Mutant Killer You did a great event. So-so. Some wine? I don't drink when I'm working. So professional. Are you used to live here? In fact... We're here to catch those mutants like Cheung Tai Chu. But I finally realize, it's not that dreadful if only your body turns into a monster. What do you mean? People may get lost sometimes. And even lose the ego. While we're striving for fame and gain, we change unconsciously. It's so quiet, Old man. It hasn't been that peaceful for a long time. Did you say you want to buy a house by the sea and have a peaceful life? Alright. Just buy a house when we arrested the mutants. Do you remember tomorrow is a special date? Our wedding plan, you missed the appointment again. Tai. I'm really confident this time. We've found out their weakness. I'll fix it soon. We've never dealt with such tough mutants. Old man. Let's get some help. Help? Have we ever needed help? Sunny. They are all monsters though. Let's ask this monster for help, It'd be much easier. Don't you trust me? You think I couldn't manage it, right? Old man. You know that's not what I meant. Also, on that day... You did put Sunny in a dangerous situation. You saw the mutants but you didn't call the police. Don't you think you're too selfish for doing that? Am I selfish? Okay it's up to you. I wouldn't settle down unless I achieved success and gained fame. Even if we can buy a house by the sea, do you think we really feel happy and peaceful? Tired? Not feeling well? Just tell me. Flying dagger is the best, nothing can compare. I could help you out. Do you think I'm bad? No. Don't you think I'm too selfish... To use you on purpose? As long as you're happy, that'd be fine. Angel... It's you... you make my dreams come true. I can finally do performance of flying dagger on stage as great as my father did. No matter what... I have to thank you. Idiot. Don't move, monster, don't move. Alright Attack him! Okay. Monster moves a bit. Look left together. Yes! Time for rest. Have been working for a whole night, this is so yummy. Flying dagger-r hero? I told you, I'll be back. Without you, My life is worthless. Bro Chu My blood... may not save you. You'd better confess to your crime. I don't care! I just want your blood! The number you dial can not be reached at the moment, please try again later. Your life is mine! And... Angel belongs to me too. Do not hurt Angel! You damn monster, you still don't get it! Is there something wrong with your brain? I won't let you off... unless you died! Go with me. It's you again! You are finally here. Alright! Today, I have to offer your blood as sacrifice to my husband! Four major acupuncture points are blocked. Is it paralysed? Wanna run? You are mine! You cannot run away... Open the door! The studio is on fire! Open the door! I heard some noise. Call the police! I'm going to take you for scientific experiments. As you can't move anymore. You'll soon become an specimen. It's useless... Why? Why! I have been waiting for you long. Old man, run! Tai, I am going to fulfil my promise. The wedding day remains unchanged. Old man, you can't win. Run! I can't win? I beat him up out there. Look at him... Tai, show time. Old man! Stop that! It's useless! Old man, run! You are still evolving! Tai, are you alright? Is anyone hurt? What the hell! I can't imagine the monster can evolve so quickly. Acupuncture doesn't work. At least one got killed. How dare you think I'm easy to deal with. Tai. Use steel mill, and double anaesthetic. We will definitely get that monster next time. Tai! Shau Wah... Shau Wah! Stop fooling with me... It's not funny... I don't want to... Old man... I like you to call me Tai. You give me this name. Tai... Be good... It'd be fine... Don't sleep... We are going to hospital now, it'd be fine. No need. Old man... Sorry... You have to take care of yourself in the future. Stop saying that... I don't want it! Without you... how could I carry on? Don't leave me... Old man... Remember... In any circumstances, don't lose yourself. Old man... Tai... It's okay. Don't be afraid. No matter where you are, I'll be with you. I'll be with you... You would never get lost. Old man... It's beautiful here... so peaceful... Tai... Tai... Tai... I'm wrong... please come back. Come back, please... I won't do it anymore... Thanks for saving me. We're the same. Our lives were befuddled. From now on, there's no business of mine. No matter that's right or wrong, I have done that. It's time to leave. I have been a hero for a period. Twin-dagger Hero... It changed my whole life. I thought that could bring me happiness and success. In fact... I've been deceiving myself. You could even risk your life for achieving fame in the past How come you give up so easily now? Suen Ho... please help me... Tai once said... You little monster is able to tackle them. Let me teach you how to control over your power. That's the last request from Tai. You imbibed too much poison gas, but you excreted all of them luckily. You are only a half-mutant. You can use your power only when you are in danger. Unfortunately you can't control it. And you can't do your flying dagger well. I'm now giving you training to improve your concentration. Concentrate on your target, don't think anything else. I will tell you the weakness of Cheung Tai Chu. News Headlines The series of attacks of mutants has caused heavy casualties. Experts have not yet come up with a proper way to deal with the mutants The mutants kidnapped six scientists of biochemistry.

Oh, I better say we're lovers. And we'll be together forever. Lovers? Why do you love me? Whenever I think about you... I feel happy. Do you know what love is? It's a kind of feeling.
