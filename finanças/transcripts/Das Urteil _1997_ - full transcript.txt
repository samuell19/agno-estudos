Mr. Rabinovicz? Excuse me, Sir. I have an important message for you. - For me? - A passenger is urgently asking you to take the later flight to Hamburg. - Please. - Why should I? This envelope contains a first-class ticket with a firm booking for the next flight at 9:00 a.m. As a first-class passenger you can of course pass the time comfortably in the VIP lounge. If you choose to take the later flight, the book is yours. [IN HEBREW]: Sefer haggadah shel pesaḥ. Agreed, Sir? Sir? Mmm-hmm. Yeah, okay. Thanks. Sir? [IN ENGLISH]: Your boarding card, please. [IN ENGLISH]: Thank you. Thank you. My name is Rabinovicz. Too late, Sir, unfortunately. - The plane's leaving already. - My name is Rabinovicz. I gave up my seat to Hamburg to another passenger. Can you please give me his name? - I'm sorry, Sir. - Why not? On your passenger list there must be a different name instead of Rabinovicz now. Firstly, I'm not allowed to give you any information about the passengers, secondly, it wasn't necessary to give up your seat to someone. The flight to Hamburg is barely half full. An employee from Avia Service was waiting for me here and asked me to. Avia Service? She had a cap on that said "Avia Service". I'm not aware of it, Sir. There's no Avia Service in our transit area here. [PA]: Please keep an eye on your luggage. [PA]: Never leave it unattended. [PA]: Should unauthorized persons-- No one touched your bag. I was keeping an eye on it. I need the number for Avia Service. Can you help me? - Avia? - Service. It's not listed. That can't be. I got my ticket through this Avia Service. This ticket was issued by American Express. Yesterday. The buyer paid cash. Then American Express must know. [IN FRENCH]: Jacqueline? It's me, Carole. [IN FRENCH]: Do you know if you are working with an Avia Service there? [IN FRENCH]: No? [IN FRENCH]: Exactly, neither have I. [IN FRENCH]: All right. Thanks. Kiss kiss. Avia Service isn't known to American Express either. Tomorrow at 6:00 a.m. at the latest the information desk in the concourse is open again. Perhaps they can help you further. Thank you. Excuse me. - Excuse me. - Hmm? How can one get something to drink here? By taking what you want to have. Where do I pay? Don't start any new customs here! At these prices you shouldn't give the airline the idea that they can even charge for drinks as well. Is it that expensive? Don't you remember what you paid? Then I'll treat myself, eh? I wouldn't buy a first-class ticket with my own money, though. Jakob Brandeis publishing house. Prague and Wrocław. 1900. Bilingual. Right? The Haggadah that you're holding, I mean. What's it to you? Name me a price. I'll give you whatever you want for it. I'm not selling. Not even for a whole lot of money? I'm not letting go of it again for anything in the world. - May I? - How dare you?! I'm not letting you take it away from me again! No one's trying to take anything away from you. I wanted to look at it. Thank you for the friendliness. Are you in the book business? Are you searching for something to talk about because you're bored? Or do you want to discuss my offer? I've been looking for it for 45 years. I'm happy to have it. At least tell me where you found it. It was given to me in exchange for giving up my seat on the flight to Hamburg. I also got a first-class ticket for the next flight. Okay. You don't have to tell me. It's the truth. I just don't understand it. The flight to Hamburg was half empty. He could've had plenty of seats. How do you account for that? I don't have a clue. A young lady, her cap read "Avia Service", handed me the Haggadah and the ticket. But no one here in the airport knows anything about an Avia Service. No Avia Service in the phone book. I don't understand it. Someone wanted you to take a later flight. But why? Will you miss an appointment if you arrive late in Hamburg? No. Well, what I don't understand is why didn't you ask the lady? I wasn't thinking. I was so stunned. It was like a dream. Suddenly I'm holding the Haggadah in my hands. I've been looking for it for decades. Twice a year I've put ads in the paper. I've written letters. Hundreds. Suddenly I'm holding it in my hands. So it must have been someone who knew that you're looking for this book. If he knows I'm looking for it, he would've also known for how long. So why's he giving it away? And a first-class seat along with it. One of your friends probably wanted to surprise you with this gift. None of my friends could let go of this much money. The dealers who know, they would keep me on tenterhooks for weeks before taking me to the cleaners for the Haggadah. There must be decent people as well. No one could've known that I'd be on my way from here to Hamburg this very day. But it must be someone who knew that you'd be traveling from New York to Hamburg today. And he also knows that you've been looking for this Haggadah. If, as you say, no one benefits from you arriving late in Hamburg, then there's only one possibility. He wanted-- ...or she... wanted you to remain here for a few hours. So all you have to do is sit here and wait for what will happen. That's easy for you to say. Who's going to guarantee that no one's going to come up and shoot me? Does anyone have a reason? There are plenty of nutjobs in the world who don't need a special reason for something like that. But surely nutjobs don't announce their assassination with the great gong of a noble gift. Why didn't I ask her?! I should have said, "Sure, but I need to know who's behind it and what he wants from me." That would've been easiest, yes. Do you think I should inform the police? You'd have to expect that the Haggadah would be confiscated as evidence. That's out of the question. A difficult decision. If you tell the police, you risk losing the Haggadah again, if you don't, you may be risking your life. You have a nice way of bolstering someone's courage. If someone is giving me the Haggadah because he wants to kill me, he won't deny himself his pleasure simply because I've given the book to the police. Or are you now going to tell me that my life will no longer be in danger once I have sold the Haggadah to you? A friend of mine would be very happy to have this Haggadah. Maybe you'll also tell me that it could be an attack by terrorists. A letter bomb that's hidden in the Haggadah. Then you'll probably say that you'll sacrifice yourself and take the book to the police for me. Then it's gone. How can someone be so distrustful? If you weren't distrustful too, then you wouldn't keep your money in a pouch on your chest. [IN FRENCH]: À la bonne heure. When you deal with people day after day who-- who want to pick up expensive pieces in the antique bookstore for little money, then you learn to recognize whether someone has a little money or a lot, and where they're hiding it. You work in an antique bookstore? Lower East Side. East 4th Street. Not a fancy area, but the collectors come because they think people in the area don't have a clue about how much books can be worth. You're antique book dealer and couldn't get this Haggadah yourself? I tried everything. I even learned the modern Hebrew script because I wanted to correspond with families who came from Germany. I found some who have it. But they didn't want to let go of it, because it was the only reminder of people who never returned. And then it's suddenly gifted to you. That's odd indeed. Now he's starting up with it again. You do want something. What would I want? Like someone walking around the store knows exactly where it is, the metsie, but he doesn't look at it, he walks around, talks and talks, to make you sluggish and tired. When it's time, then he goes for it and offer two or three dollars. You're happy that you've made a small deal after all. By the time you realize what he took, he's long gone. If I'm right about you, that's never happened to you. But to others often enough. My father had it. This edition. This exact one. It was holy to him. His father had it before he did. It looked just like this. It may even be the same one. He showed me the writing, and after my seventh birthday he let me read with him on Seder evening how the Holy Spirit, praised be He, delivered his people from Mizraim and led them through the Red Sea to freedom. "He will do it again this time," my father said, and kissed the Haggadah in which all that is written. That was in Theresienstadt. There was never a more beautiful Passover after that. You're Jewish. Born in Germany? In Leipzig. The Nuremberg Laws were just one year old. You too? "Believing in God" they called it back then. My father left the church because he believed he owed it to his Führer. Your friend for whom you'd like to have the Haggadah...? He's Jewish. Why is he looking for it? He...had to give away his own. He did it voluntarily because he wanted to help a friend with it. I couldn't do it. You live in New York? Manhattan. I couldn't go back-- I couldn't live in the countryside. I understand that. As an antique book dealer, how would you get books there? And customers? Even in the big city there aren't a whole lot of customers. Everyone wants to discover something special and pay nothing for it. The worst are the collectors who aren't looking for a book, but rather an object of value. And they probably have the most money. Is your father still alive? No. He would be 95 now. Has he been dead long already? For ten years. He was granted a long life. When a person's lying there like that and no longer breathing, then it still hurts despite everything. Do you have children? Mmm-mmm. Maybe if a woman had been there who would've bolstered one's courage again. MURDER ON LUXURY LINER Look at this. All the papers are full of it. In the States too? We have enough murders of our own in America. Our media are rarely reliant on horror stories imported from other countries. At the end of a Mediterranean cruise, a British billionaire was stabbed to death on a German ship as it was entering the Port of Hamburg. A German publisher is believed to have committed the murder. The trial begins the day after tomorrow. I read about it. Uh, yeah? What do you think about it? He's probably guilty. How do you figure that? The way the newspapers present it, it must have been him. There are also some who vehemently defend the accused. I believe he did it, and I believe he will confess yet. Mmm-mmm. He didn't do it. No? They walked him off the ship. In handcuffs. He-- He looked... desperate. He looked back at the ship like someone who is only slowly realizing what has happened, and-- and would like to undo it. I felt sorry for him, and... he probably killed a person, but... I felt sorry for him. There's no plausible motive. But imagine: He worked his whole life then someone else gets into competition with him just on impulse, out of spite. He becomes a poor man overnight, and the one who made him that way has become even richer from it. Isn't that a motive? He wanted to start over again. At 70? Why would someone who no longer has any money go on an expensive cruise for which he'll have to get into debt? Where is he supposed to get the energy for a new start? He had to take a vacation. No! It was an investment! A last-ditch rescue effort. He wanted to make peace with Hamilton on this cruise so that the banks would grant him loans again. He didn't agree to it. Everything was in vain, and Wolf didn't know where he was supposed to get the money to live and pay his new debts. So he snapped and killed him. That's incorrect. Completely incorrect. It can't have gone that way. I'm not saying that he went on the cruise because he wanted to kill the man. Just, the way he looked, everything is futile. He is not someone who acts hastily, but rather is always calm and collected. Everyone says and writes that. He has no temperament at all? To the contrary. They say he is very energetic and decisive. And controlled. "Controlled"? He has always controlled his temper. It's only gotten the better of him once. Listening to you, one might believe the judges had already rendered judgment. But he's lucky that you're not his defense attorney. Because you twist everything so that it sounds like he did it deliberately, with intent from the start. You're not listening. I said he didn't do it. But if you're wrong and he did it after all, then according to your theory one would have to say that he planned and carried out everything with full intent. But it's no use to him that Hamilton's dead. That doesn't clear up his debts and it's harder than ever to get a loan now. He knew that. That's probably what made him so desperate. Hamilton didn't want to help him. He would've had to disembark without a cent, with a mountain of debts, and without knowing what he will live on now. He has friends who would've helped him. They would've had to do that earlier, to tell him early enough: "You are not alone. We will help you.“ He wouldn't have had to be so desperate if it had been like that. After the fact it's easy to say: "Why didn't you tell me?" You have friends as long as you're doing well. But when the seven years of famine have begun, you're mostly alone on Shabbos. You must know everything, hmm? No one can tell you anything that you don't know better. Aren't we similar in that way? Wolf would not have been dependent on Hamilton. They would grant him loans? Oh, sure. - He would also have money to live? - No question. Then he has already paid back his debts? How is he supposed to earn money when he's been sitting in custody since his return? Are you sure that somewhere along the line you didn't have someone among your ancestors who would have the candles lit on Shabbat? I'm not aware of anything like that. But it wouldn't bother me. Because you reason like Shlomo the painter. He was supposed to paint Jacob Blue's garden fence green, but he only had yellow paint. So he used that and said to Jacob Blue: "Blue and yellow make green anyway!" You came up with that just now. Is the joke that bad? Ahh, that was a joke. Fine. Let's fight about my bad joke. I prefer that. Maybe you'll get less agitated about that. That could be my plane to Hamburg. Yeah, it's possible. I would be sitting comfortably in it, and wouldn't have to be quibbling with you about a murder that has nothing to do with either of us. If it explodes now, then we'll know that the unknown donor means well by you. That's a better joke? What would you have wanted to be if Hitler hadn't existed? A happy person who doesn't grumble about everything. Someone people like. I mean professionally. Is there any use in thinking about that? You probably never get rid of the fear entirely. I don't have any fear. It's hard to imagine what goes on inside a person who had to experience all that. I know. No one wants to talk about that. And who wants to listen, huh? Many are curious. That's for sure. But what's down at the bottom, everything you don't know yourself until you've said it... No one wants to wait for that. Excuse me. Are you Nathan Spellman? No. Forgive me. What does he want? He's looking for a Mr. Spellman. You didn't see that. From behind, his eyes, the way he was looking at me. And he photographed me from there. I came in and he photographed me! He probably first thought you were Mr. Spellman. Because someone's named Spellman, he has to be photographed? But if someone's named Rabinovicz, he has to be killed? I didn't tell you my name. I don't know about Rabinovicz, but some have wanted to kill me because of the "S". Really? Guess what it stands for. - Salomon. - No. Samuel. That's what's on my passport now, but my old dad had something completely different entered in the baptismal register in Leipzig. You have to understand, he was so proud of his Germany. In the first war he was promoted to junior NCO for bravery. Wagner. After his God, that was the highest for him. So he named his only son Siegfried. Siegfried Rabinovicz. Can you imagine all the things that came into SS soldiers' heads when they had a Jew named Siegfried in front of them? - You were born in 19-- - '36. Hitler had already been in power for three years then. That didn't bother my dad. "One day", I'm told he always used to say, "one day this Germany will shake itself and the brown vermin will fly out of it like fleas out of a dog's fur." Mmm. His brother told me that. The only one who returned. And your father? My uncle already emigrated to Australia in the summer of '33. My father really held it against him, the old fool. "You can't abandon your country when criminals have geared themselves up in it." But... my uncle survived, many criminals too, my father didn't. What's the use in talking about what hurts and will always hurt, for nothing? If it doesn't change anything in this world. If no one knows what happened, then it has even less chance of getting better. People don't listen to the victims and they don't listen to the guilty, not to the victims who have become guilty, and not to the guilty who were sometimes only victims themselves. A person is sitting there in a cell and would probably like to talk about his guilt, would like to find someone to help him to bear it. But, if he still has friends, then they will only demand from him that he is innocent. The others expect a confession from him so that they can judge him or proof of his innocence, because they don't want the hunt for a sensation to already be over with his conviction. You're firmly convinced that he did it? It couldn't have been anyone else. But Hamilton's wife has been having a relationship with another man for years. What does that concern us? Her lover was also on the ship. Don't you know that? I read all that too. Hamilton didn't have any reason to object to that relationship. It suited him. He'd had a different orientation for a long time. So why should they have killed him? Because they wanted to finally be free and live together. She could've asked for a divorce. Did she try that? Naturally she didn't want to give up the fortune, so they decided to do away with him. If you can also prove that, it would interest the jury very much. We have lay judges and professional judges in Germany, no jury. And they're not interested in evidence? Or don't you have any? Are you just repeating what's written in this rag? Why "rag"? Just because the paper has a different opinion than you? You like this style? The witnesses are senile, dishonest, deal carelessly with the truth... Reading that can make a person sick. And what the other papers are writing that already pronounced the accused guilty before he had even been charged, that doesn't make you sick? It could be that that's not correct either. But according to the witness statements he's guilty, and witnesses only say what they've seen and heard. What they believe to have seen and heard, and what they want to remember. Everything was investigated by the police and checked by the state attorney. Now the judges have it. Wait for the judgment. No one looks any further when they have someone who's sufficiently suspicious. Then they only gather what can be used as evidence against the accused. Who else is supposed to have done it? Her lover! Wolf argued with Hamilton several times on the ship. His wife and her lover were thereby able to twist it so that the suspicion had to fall on Wolf. They didn't pass up this opportunity. But it can't have gone that way. There's no way you could know that. Maybe better than you. Uh-- Why? Because-- Because I've read at least as much about it just as you have. Including this? "A pitiless witness". The man who wrote this seems to be a clairvoyant. Anyone with a different opinion than yours is dismissed. Sooner or later he'll confess. He has nothing to confess. But unless a miracle helps him, he will be wrongly imprisoned for years until it emerges that Hamilton was stabbed to death by his wife's lover. At least read this one article. For a few minutes, allow another opinion to be valid and consider it. It's tacky to suspect two people of murder because they are in a relationship together. That's the way of dealing with people. Nothing's changed, probably. It remains that he who stinks lies, and he who lies steals as well. You believe I think that way? No, no, not you. People like these trash journalists. They don't write these things to inform their readers, they want to lure in buyers. Any nasty trick will suit them as long as it it leads to better sales for their newspaper. I wonder if you would argue the same way if the accused weren't a German, but rather an Englishman, and her lover weren't an American, but rather a German. I didn't know that he's an American. Not even that? You don't know anything, yet you've rendered a judgment. You're not willing to give the accused even the slighted chance. I don't understand why you're getting so excited. The whole thing has nothing to do with either of us. A person is sitting in prison and, unless a miracle happens, will be convicted, even though he's innocent. You think that has nothing to do with us? Someone else is profiting from it. He went in, stabbed a person to death in cold blood, and will walk away free. That has nothing to do with us? He takes one man's life by force and steals it from another. But that has nothing to do with us? I thought you only read those things in books. The fact that there's really a person who thinks that way when it's about people he doesn't know... It does good to know that. It's just a shame that you're getting worked up about the wrong man. The accused is guilty, believe me. If Wolf is convicted, it won't bring any of the people you're actually thinking about back to life. I'm not thinking about that. I didn't think about that for one second. You don't think about anything else. Only that! Otherwise you wouldn't talk this way. I talk this way because I was there. I was on the ship! Here. The man this trash journalist considers to be a questionable witness, that's me! I was there. I saw him. In the paper there's only something about a witness named S. R. I couldn't have known that-- that that's you! You should have told me. I saw them in the hallway. The women who gave me the Haggadah and the ticket and the man who photographed me. And? They ran away. - Do you want the police after all? - What would they say? It's not a crime to give a gift to someone. I didn't have to take the gift, or-- could've asked where it came from. She's not wearing the cap with "Avia Service" on it anymore, by the way. You're worried. Wouldn't you be? Should there be ill intent connected with this gift, then it will be carried out while you're waiting here or on the flight that was booked for you. That's a big help. Give me your ticket. I'll change bookings. For us both. Then you won't be alone here. And no one will know which connection you're taking or when you're arriving. I can't ask you to do that. It'll cost more, too. Don't worry about it. It's all good. We're flying to Frankfurt at 8:30 and from there you have a connection to Hamburg. I'm kicking myself for getting you involved in the matter at all, but I am very grateful to you. Maybe you really are dealing with a crazy person. Maybe you could be a politician, too. First you say one thing, then later the exact opposite, but it always sounds so convincing. Such is life. It's not for nothing that the Bible says, "God hath spoken once, twice have I heard this". I didn't say anything about God. I imagine Him to be quite different. I was just quoting a psalm. You probably don't like to talk about yourself either. Only if I absolutely can't think of anything better. I've never experienced that before in my life. Any time it looks as though there might be a mazel for me, it always means that a schlimazel will follow right behind it. It has always been that way. My entire life. Enviable. You're making fun of me? No, not at all. You can be happy about every misfortune, because fortune would only bring you more misfortune. But listen to this. Do you know how I got on that cruise? There was a puzzle-solving competition. Five washing machines were going to be given away as runner-up prizes. "With mazel," I thought, "I could win one of them." "Mine has just about died." But what did I win? The first prize, a Mediterranean cruise on a luxury liner, flight to Hamburg, by ship to Southampton, then through the Mediterranean to Israel, and back to Hamburg. "Fine," I think. "You always wanted to go to Eretz Yisrael, now you finally can." "It may be a German ship, but fifty years is a long time." "Mazel." What happens? When we're arriving in Hamburg I have to be standing right where I can see the man who goes into a cabin and stabs another man to death there. Now I'm a witness, have to testify in a trial, and on top of that I'm being played for a fool by someone here. You consider it a misfortune that you've finally gotten your Haggadah. No, that's the fortune, but a load of misfortune is probably following behind it. You saw the murderer? Are you completely sure? That was an unhappy coincidence too. A glass of juice spills on the carpet in my cabin. A girl is cleaning Hamilton's suite next door at that moment, so I ask her to clean up the schlimazel. She finishes in Hamilton's suite, locks up, and comes to my cabin. - Was she cute? - Very. Thai girl. While she's cleaning I stay in the doorway talking to her and that's how I heard what happened next door in the cabin. In the paper it says that when the police in Hamburg wanted to know who had seen or heard something, you didn't speak up at first. It has nothing to do with reality. But when a door closes and German voices can be heard outside, then they're back, the shadows that won't let you think or sleep. That's manageable, but what's not manageable is when you dream that the door opens they all come in, live, and everything's like before. I wanted to leave, not to have to stay in Hamburg after landing. But then you spoke up after all. The police interrogated the crew and the Thai girl said that I must have seen the murderer. That's how they got to me. When someone's gone through what you've had to go through, is it even possible? Can you give objective testimony in a case in which the accused is a German? Say what I saw and heard. I can do that. I'm a witness, not a judge. But it could depend on your testimony whether the accused is convicted or acquitted. You actually are his judge. There are other witnesses too. You're the one who matters. I wouldn't want to be in your shoes. It would suit you if I said that I can't remember anything? It would suit me if you would check very carefully whether you really have a gap-free objective memory of the events. How do I do that? For every detail you have to ask yourself whether that's the way you saw or heard it or whether that's the way you wanted to see or hear it. I needed that advice from you. Really. I never would've come up with that myself. What do you think I've been doing in the months since then? They always say that you get desensitized. I've never had that fortune, at least. It's like it's all burned in up here. A person who one hour earlier was still healthy as a fish swimming in the pool is lying there. Blood is everywhere. How can you forget that? You see everything again and again. But beforehand, what you saw and heard then, you didn't yet know that it would be important. Can you precisely remember that too? It was important to me. When I heard that voice, from that moment on it was important to me. One has learned to listen to the undertone in a voice. That's the only way one was able to survive, and that has remained with one. A person who will become dangerous has a voice that sounds different, even if it's quiet and calm. But an undertone in a voice is not proof that the man committed a murder. The tone says that he is capable of committing one, and that gets one wide awake. A person who has this tone in his voice, one listened very carefully to him in order to avoid doing anything wrong. Did you also hear Hamilton's wife or her lover speaking with him? I can't remember. Then how can you know whether you might not have heard an even clearer undertone from them? The two had a motive. What kind? Love. What drives people to murder can't be love. Then you're not familiar with life-- or love. But you? You know it all and are more familiar with it all. It has happened thousands of times. People who were so in love with each other who were so full of yearning and desire for each other that they were willing to do anything and did away with the unloved partner in cold blood. That's love? Isn't it? When one only gets one piece of bread this big for the whole day and can barely think from hunger, but one sets aside half of it, he for her, she for him. But you were still a child. When is one a child? When is one no longer one? How old were you? We saw each other every day. Rivka. She was pretty, Rivka. Clever and good. When it's all over, we promised each other, we will find our parents and later marry. Then she stopped coming. A Kapo whom I asked where she is, Rivka, he just pointed to a chimney where the dark, heavy smoke was coming out. I didn't believe him. I was always waiting and hoping that she would turn up again one day. I'm still waiting. [SS SOLDIER]: Everyone stay in position in front of the train! [SS SOLDIER]: Everyone stay together in the group! [SS SOLDIER]: Luggage stays on the train! [SS SOLDIER]: Luggage stays on the train! [SS SOLDIER]: Women on the left side! [SS SOLDIER]: Men to the right, women to the left! [SS SOLDIER]: Women to the left! [SS SOLDIER]: Arrivals step out! Mr. Rabinovicz? Mr. Rabinovicz? Do you know what books the man whom you hold for a murderer published? You'll tell me. Each and every year at least three or four about the Holocaust. That's how he came across to me, like someone who doesn't evade guilt. I believe he will confess yet. Why won't you accept anything at all that speaks in favor of him? So far you haven't said anything of the sort except that you think someone else is the murderer. - Isn't that enough? - Mr. Rabinovicz? - Yes? - There's a message for you. The gentleman is very sorry that he can't meet you. His flight was delayed and he was just able to catch the flight to Rio. He hopes that you enjoy the Haggadah. - And? Is that all? - Yes, sir. - No name? - No, sir. Why didn't you ask? My colleague probably assumed that you'd know whom you're meeting. Has the flight to Rio already left? 10 minutes ago. Do you understand this? At least we now know that there's no plan to murder you. I'm not supposed to meet anybody. Maybe you forgot. Surely I'm not that meschugge. I don't know anyone who flies all over the world and can blow money on 1st-class tickets. Then it can only be a benefactor who saw your ads and gifted you the Haggadah. I don't believe in the fairy tale of a selfless person who does good deeds. But apparently one does exist. You believe in a good person and in Santa Claus. And that Wolf didn't kill Hamilton. What else did you want to tell me? Here is a precisely researched reconstruction of the course of events. Don't keep coming to me with this Schlüter fellow. Apart from you, he's the only one defending the accused. Or at least he writes that. But his only proof is the claim that I'm a merciless and unreliable witness. Aren't you? Pitiless? A desperate person lost his temper for a moment and made a threat that he never really meant. But a reputable witness who believes his memory to be infallible gives that to the state attorney as evidence that brands this desperate person a murderer. There's Wolf! How do you hear the audio? Use the headphones! Find the right channel. - Do you have another set of headphones? - Yes. Here you go. What did they say? It was already over. - Were you able to learn anything? - About what? What was said on TV about Wolf. Whom was I supposed to ask? You look like someone who is deliberating what he will say. I think I just look that way. He's calling me a liar. It doesn't say that. Not literally, but it can be derived from what he writes. You called him a trash journalist. Not publicly in a paper. But only because you don't have a paper available. That's probably true. If it's true what you say that the judgment may only hinge on my testimony, then help me, please. Not for the world would I want to say the wrong thing and thereby make a person even more miserable. What can I do? Listen to me, and if you think that I need to consider some point or other more carefully, then please tell me immediately. Agreed. That afternoon, just before three, I was on deck. Hamilton was in the swimming pool. Our cabins are next door to each other, so I greet him, he greets me. His wife comes out of the bar and passes him a lit cigarette. He thanks her with a kiss. She goes back into the bar and sits there without leaving until the murder is discovered. That doesn't rule out that she knew about or perhaps even planned the crime. I'd like to check my testimony, not yours. That's your mistake! You see everything solely from your perspective. But if my presumption is true that her lover was already hiding in the cabin, then she must have given him the key. The fact is that she was in the bar the whole time. Where was he supposed to be hiding in your opinion? The girl who cleaned the cabin would've had to have seen him. She said that no one was in the cabin. Did she search everywhere? The bedroom, the bathroom, the cupboards under the-- No one asked her about that. Then Hamilton unlocked the cabin. Before he could close the door from the inside, Wolf had pushed his way into the cabin. There was a heated exchange of words. Which you remember precisely? Fairly precisely, I believe. Was the cabin door closed? Open. The entire time. It wasn't really an exchange of words. Hamilton hardly said anything. Hardly anything? Or nothing? - Little. - But? It wasn't important, otherwise I'd remember it. But you remember precisely what Wolf said? Hamilton laughed loudly once. It sounded horrific. Taunting, humiliating for the other person. But you don't remember what he said to Wolf anymore. Let me tell the story. You can ask questions afterwards. Please. As you wish. It's like this... Hamilton was killed by a stab to the heart. This way of killing was part of the close combat training in the units of the German Armed Forces in which Wolf served during World War II. Would you still accuse Wolf of being a murderer if he had served in the English or French or American army? Why do you always ascribe such thoughts to me? However can you be free of them? Wolf was a soldier in World War II. A soldier in the German Armed Forces. Yes or no? Men are trained in close combat in all of the armies in the world. By that logic there'd be millions of suspects. But millions weren't on the ship. But surely Wolf wasn't the only one. Were the others checked too? I don't know. But I know. Not a single one. It wasn't considered necessary because there's a witness who claims to have seen Wolf leaving the cabin after the murder. Why do you keep talking about murder? I'm saying that it was a crime of passion. There are no witnesses who saw the crime. There's no confession. Everything is based solely on conjecture. But in case of doubt one must rule in favor of the accused, not against him. So everyone who could have done it ought to have been investigated. That wasn't done. Due to your statement, the state attorney concentrated on Wolf and compiled everything that can be construed against him to some extent. Do you have so little trust in German judges? What can a judge do when there's a witness who is willing to swear that Wolf committed the crime? I never said that. As far as is humanly possible to tell, he must be the culprit. Those were my words. What does that mean? Merely that you want to see Wolf convicted of murder without having to assume responsibility for it. Should he turn out to be innocent, no one can reproach you for anything. After all, you said "as far as is humanly possible to tell". I, the witness Rabinovicz, am only human, not God, who alone knows the truth. Should I be wrong, I can't be blamed. But I have to say what I saw and heard. They're going to make me take the oath. He was talking insistently to Hamilton, so desperately. I felt infinitely sorry for him. I could understand him so well, because I had once been in a similar situation myself. The building owner wanted to force me into bankruptcy so that his store space would free up. Did you kill him? In my head? Every night. During the day I toiled away and begged for loans. And were lucky. I had to file for bankruptcy and start all over again. And despite this you killed no one? Thank God our actions count, not our thoughts. And why the Hell shouldn't it have been the same with Wolf? He thought it, said it, sure. But he didn't do it. Just like you. He did it. Why do you hold yourself to be a better person? Because you're Jewish and he's German? I haven't said a single word alluding to what was in the past. But the whole time you're criticizing me for being Jewish. I-- I'm establishing it. I have respect for what you had to go through. If that sounded like criticism, I'm sorry. Why are you championing this Wolf so much? Let me ask you first why you're so blasé about his fate. Is that how you perceive it? You're determined to put him behind bars for life with your testimony. I'll have to swear to tell the truth and nothing but the truth. Which you don't precisely know, though. I know what I saw and heard. So what did you hear? The desperate outburst of a tortured person. - Helpless, rash babbling! - Don't shout at me like that! How's a person supposed to think calmly with that going on? The state attorney will treat you in a completely different way. He doesn't care whether or not you can think. He wants use your testimony to pin the accused down as a murderer. He will keep twisting your words until you say what he needs for the judgment. What did I hear? Hamilton canceled the holiday pay of the staff in one of his printing works. Why did he do that? So that they would strike. And what did he get out of that? The books for the Wolf publishing house were not delivered on time. That ruined Wolf, and he accused Hamilton of that. And how did Hamilton respond? There was this terrible laugh. Then Wolf asked him to at least stop coercing the banks not to give him any more loans. And Mr. Hamilton refused? I didn't hear his response. It was very quiet. But then, I remember this clearly because his voice sounded so bitter, so desperate, "You want to finally ruin me, Hamilton." And he calmly responded, "Yes." And a little later, "Are you going to shoot yourself now? I'm very curious." He laughed again. And then there was that tone that generates fear. "You'll never know, Hamilton, because you will no longer be alive." Perhaps he said that, but even if he did, he surely didn't really mean it. That's how I heard it. And then? It was quiet. I didn't hear anything else. Why didn't you do anything? You don't immediately suspect a crime when there's no talking next door for two or three minutes. Yeah, but then the undertone can't have been so alarming. Or else that means you did nothing when you were convinced that next door a person's life might've been in peril. That's right, what you're saying. Maybe I didn't think that until later, when I thought back about how it was at the time. The Thai girl was very cute, you said. Very. Didn't that make your thoughts start to wander? Her hands, her legs, her little round breasts? And how that might all look, let's say, in a bikini. You really want to know the precise details. The state attorney and defense attorney will want to know even more precisely. You talked with her? Nothing special. I asked what her name is, where she's from. The things one asks. And? She answered? Broken. Her English isn't very good. Despite this, at the same time you heard exactly was was being said in the next cabin? The door was open. I couldn't avoid hearing it. When did you notice that it had gone quiet in Hamilton's cabin? When? Just how long it takes until one notices something like that. After you noticed that it had gone quiet, how much time passed until you heard someone leaving the cabin? A minute. Maybe two. Was there a clock that you used for reference? Did you even pay attention to how much time had passed? There wasn't any reason to do so. Maybe you were taking a stroll with that cute girl in your thoughts at the time. One minute might have passed, or two, or five. There's no point of reference for how much time really passed. It can't have been very long. After all, it doesn't take an eternity to wipe up juice from a carpet and prepare the cabin for the night. The girl wasn't being very meticulous with her work anyway. But there's no real point of reference for how much time actually passed. I can't offer you a timetable down to the second. Someone who is alleging something as firmly as you are would actually have to be able to. First there was the argument, then it was quiet, and after a time I found it odd that the door was still open. I wanted to turn around, and then I saw him coming out. - Who? - Wolf. Hamilton was dead, after all. At that moment you didn't know that yet. Right. You turned around and saw him? No. I didn't want to let him know that I'd heard the argument. So you didn't see who came out of the cabin? Wolf's the only one that it could've been. The girl stated that no one was in the cabin. That's why she locked the door. Hamilton came later. He first unlocked the door again. You saw that? Saw and heard. He greeted me with a nod. When he went to close the door from the inside, Wolf was suddenly there and pushed his way in. Where did he come from? He was probably waiting here. What do you mean, "probably"? You saw him. Very clearly. You said the stairs were here? Approximately. Well-lit? Very bright. When you then heard someone leaving the cabin later, you had to be looking directly into the light. Yet you claim to have recognized someone who ran away with his back to you? It's possible that I didn't see his face. But it was him, I know it. It was his voice too. In court I advise you to only say you believe you saw him. Anything else could later be held against you as perjury. You're getting me all flustered! Fine, I didn't see his face. It was-- It was a man of his stature, though. He was talking loudly and shouting in the cabin. I heard his voice. I recognized it. Then he came out of the cabin. Someone whose face you didn't see came out of the cabin. You don't know exactly how much time had passed. So it could also be true that Wolf had already quietly left earlier. You didn't notice him because your thoughts were occupied with the girl's nice figure at the time. Then you heard a sound and believed that the person coming out of the cabin is Wolf, because you didn't know that someone else had been in there. I'm not trying to influence you. You don't do anything else the entire time. Your version is that Wolf lay in wait for Hamilton and pushed his way into the cabin behind him, hmm? He asked him once again to help him. Hamilton taunted him and Wolf stabbed him to death in a crime of passion. Where did he get the knife? Hamilton often had his meals served in the cabin, usually steak and salad. It must have unfortunately been left there from the previous meal. The girl had cleaned the cabin a few minutes before. Yet the knife was still lying there? That's how the police logged it. At the time Hamilton was in the pool and his wife was in the bar, her lover was hanging around the serving room. No one asked him what he was doing there. It just so happens that the steak knives are kept there. Did you know that? No. During the entire investigation people only looked for reasons to suspect Wolf, because you claimed to have seen him shortly before you discovered the body. I'm starting to believe that I'm the only villain in this sad tale. You're protecting the villain. You haven't realized that yet. What's your version? Everyone knew that the billionaire swam for a half hour every day after his midday nap and then worked alone in his cabin. While he was in the swimming pool, the lover got the knife and, using the key that Mrs. Hamilton gave him, he entered the cabin and hid there. The girl would've had to have seen him. On the one hand you accuse her of being so sloppy that she didn't notice a knife from the previous meal on the table. On the other hand she's supposed to have meticulously cleaned every corner of the cabin? That's right. Either or. The lover observed the fight between Wolf and Hamilton from his hiding place. Wolf then presumably slunk off with his tail between his legs, quietly, so that the man in the open doorway in the next cabin would not turn around. He was humiliated, felt ashamed, didn't want to see anyone or be seen by anyone. I believe I would've had to have seen him despite everything. You believe that. But does that mean you can also say that that it didn't happen that way? Hamilton wanted to close the door behind Wolf, so he turned his back to the room. When his murderer suddenly popped up behind him, he had no way to defend himself. His rival held him tight, jabbed the knife into his heart, let him silently drop to the floor and wiped the fingerprints off the knife. All just like he learned in the Green Berets. The only thing he didn't count on was the door to your cabin being open. He probably hesitated for a moment, then he ran. You were blinded by the backlight. You only saw his silhouette. But since you had only registered Wolf, you had to believe it was him. And now imagine if we were in America. The verdict of the twelve sworn jurors must be unanimous. How do you believe the jury will decide? Think about it. You don't have to say anything to me. Take a piece of paper and write the jury's decision. And whenever you're in doubt, look at the verdict that you came to in all conscience. It'll be the right one. You've probably prevented me from making a grave error. I admire you. Greatly. Because if you weren't here I probably would've thrown someone into inescapable misery? Because you have the ability to realize an error. Let's just say that you have the ability and I contributed the error. Whatever this unknown person is still planning for me, I definitely have to be thankful to him. I never would have believed that there's a person to whom justice means so much. Thank you. Please don't overestimate me. This is a special case for me. Mr. Schlüter. Mr. Schlüter, I have an urgent call for you. I can't now. I'm sorry but Mr. Schlüter can't come to the phone at the moment. Yes, I'll tell him. Goodbye! You're supposed to call your editorial office as soon as possible. M. S. Markus Schlüter. Markus Schlüter. And again Schlüter. Always Markus Schlüter. Always you. I had to do it. He's my friend. I was just about to tell you that. Everything was arranged by you? The Haggadah, the seat in first class, the girl from Avia Service, the young man who photographed me, so that I'd believe I'm being followed and threatened. If you had still been convinced during your testimony in court that Wolf was the man who came out of Hamilton's suite, then he would've been sentenced to life in prison. Then you had the all-clear signal given, because you noticed that I trust you any you can manipulate me. Then there was this fairy tale about the-- about the unknown man who was just able to catch his flight to Rio. Wolf? My father was held captive by the Russians. He didn't come back until '55. My mother had already long been in a relationship with another man. Most of the time I roamed the streets. I lived like an animal. Without rules, without, without-- A few times I-- Twice the German police locked me up, a third time the Americans. A German interpreter was at the interrogation. That was Gerd Wolf. If he hadn't been there, then-- then I would've slipped into the gutter then and probably never gotten back up. I owe him everything-- He saved my entire-- Only due to Wolf was I able to become what I've become. Someone who tricks his way into the trust of a foolish old Jew with lies and deceit. I'm sorry. You must have researched my entire life to be able to set this trap for me. Wouldn't you too have done everything to be able to prevent a friend from having to spend a lifetime wrongly imprisoned? You lied to me. No, no, no, no, no. I didn't do that. "In the paper there's only something about a witness named S. R. I couldn't have known that that's you." Wasn't that a lie? Yes. That, yes. But everything depended on me gaining your trust. You got it. But now it's all gone. And the part about your friend who gave up his Haggadah to help someone else, was that made up too? In March '45, Wolf was assigned to a pioneer unit. Anti-tank ditches had to be dug together with concentration camp prisoners. He helped some of them escape, and one of them, Azi Salzmann, visited him after the war to thank him. They became friends. I shouldn't believe another word from you. He was convinced from the start, just as I am, that Wolf didn't kill Hamilton. His lawyer thought he wouldn't stand a chance if the witness S. R. stuck to his testimony. And then we heard from someone in New York about your search for the Haggadah. Salzmann struggled with himself for 24 hours before giving us his. "Maybe it's a sign that I have it," he said. A lure. Give it back to him. I don't want it anymore. Is the memory of your father suddenly no longer worth anything to you? It would no longer only remind me of him, but also of this night. And I'd like it to be quickly forgotten. If we hadn't staged it all this way, you would've burdened yourself with a guilt for which you never could've atoned. Finally someone I can respect, I thought, who cares about justice, who cares about the fate of a person he doesn't even know. What are you accusing me of? That he's my friend? Would you like it if he were a stranger? Or what? You deceived me, lied to me, and duped me. That's what I accuse you of. Damn it, I had to do it! I'm really sorry that I disappointed you, but please believe me that I'd do it time and time again to help Wolf. But you haven't helped him. It's too late to go back now. You know that it may not have been Wolf. You have to stick to the truth when you're under oath. Can something be the truth when it's found through a lie? If your Rivka could've been saved with a lie back then, wouldn't you have lied? Leave me my memory. Don't dirty that for me too. If you'd known a lie that could've saved your Rivka, wouldn't you have lied? There was no lie possible with her. There was no hate, no deceit. She wouldn't have allowed any lie. Your Rivka is a dream, not a person. I know that it's a dream! I know! But I have to hold on to it! You could at least allow me to have the dream! Justice is also a dream. Does that mean that we should stop pursuing it? If you want justice, why are you berating me for wanting to prevent an innocent man from having to spend life behind bars? He's my friend. But have you helped him? Now I have to say-- I have to tell the judge, "Don't listen to me. Last night a person duped me." And I also have to tell him, "I hate this man who showed me a fantasy world in which people fight for truth and justice." I have to tell the judge, "Don't listen to that, because I no longer know what's right, what I saw and then what I wanted to see for his sake. Don't believe me, Your Honor, because there is so much disappointment in me. I wanted to forget that he had a father who belonged to the other side." Will you still help me? What would you do? What would you have done? I don't know. Doesn't one have to do everything to help someone whom one thanks for enabling one to become a halfway viable person? W-- What am I supposed to tell the judge? Tell him what you want, but tell the truth. This here is the truth. Not guilty. Maybe I just wanted to believe that for your sake. That's your handwriting here. If you don't tell the truth, I will submit all of this as proof, even at the risk that you yourself may have to face the judge for perjury. You want to put me in prison? If that's how it has to be. Wolf is innocent. You can prove that. If you don't do it, then that's a far greater deception than the one you're holding against me so much. I'll say what you want. Why didn't I stay there? It's my home. It's warm there. The people are friendly. What do I care if I saw a guy who got stabbed to death? Why didn't my tongue shrivel up? Why did I have to say that I heard something and saw a man? No one can force me to go to Germany-- I'd like the next flight back home. - The flight flight to...to New York. - May I have your ticket? - [IN FRENCH]: Salut. - [IN FRENCH]: Salut. If you change the booking again, you'll have to pay another mark-up. It doesn't matter. WOLF CONFESSES TO MURDER OF HAMILTON "Collapsed under the weight of his conscience before the trial began". WOLF CONFESSES TO MURDER OF HAMILTON There's a flight at-- Do you want to change your booking or not now? We wanted to dig a hiding spot, Rivka and I, so the SS wouldn't find us when they make selections and take people away. The night when they then suddenly came, it was just big enough for one person. I got there first. There was no more room for Rivka. She had to stay outside. That was the last day. We children in Auschwitz used to play "Selection". We didn't know what it really means. All one could do was survive when being suppressed. I know that nothing's left of her. But every day I still hope that Rivka will come back. I'm going to be in New York soon. If I had your address, perhaps I could give you the opportunity to apologize to me for all of the slights and insults. But please don't forget. I'm sorry. About your Rivka.
