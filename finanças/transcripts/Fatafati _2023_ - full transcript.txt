Look at her. Do you know her? Who? An amateur tailor from a small town. Come. You need to iron this, right? Huh? Your Bachaspati Bhaduri’s fat wife. Not a model. So, she is not Miss Fatafati? Yes, she is Miss Fatafati. Oh, is it? But she won't walk as a model at tonight's show. Thank God! But why? What’s the problem? Why? But why? 95. Sit. Name? Phullora Bhaduri. Age? 28 years. How long have you been married? Five years. How many kids? Answer him. Count and answer! How many? I see. What's the problem? Doctor, I suffer from immense pain during those days of the month. I see. Babu, what are you doing here? You should go out. I should be the one sitting here. Why do you tag along? Listen, do a whole abdomen USG test. You may have an endometrial cyst. It can be cured. The problem is your weight. You’ve come here before, right? Yes. She's gone from 85 to 95 kilos meanwhile. Ma, stop it! But I've come for my pain. Yes, the pain is natural. I’ll prescribe a medicine. Buy it. Your main problem is your weight. If you don’t lose weight, conceiving will be a problem. Such massive weight at her age... Isn’t it problematic? Come, let's go. Yes. Balaram will whine again. It took us very long, right? I’ll manage. Get into the auto fast. I’ll take the next one. No, that can't happen. I’ll take the next one. Brother, start driving! Make it fast. I'll visit Rinku di on the way. Are you coming? Yes. I’ll drop Ma and go. Damn fatso... What did you say? Nothing. Let’s go. Yes. You have money? Okay, give me a call... bye. ‘FATAFATI’ Saw the electricity bill? Hmm? How much? Is your dad paying for it? Remember last month’s bill? The owner will shut the shop. Then what? Will see your faces? You guys are the sweetest while selling! But show your real face when you’ve to exchange it. You take two hours to pack up after closing down. Why? From now, you have 30 minutes. But, if it’s not in stock, how can we provide it? Why don’t you have it? What's going on? I have no idea. Handle it. Return my money. That’s not possible, sir. Come after two days, I'll give you the XXL size. Believe me. Really? What about the time I wasted here? Will you be compensating for that? Hello, I am Bachaspati Bhaduri. Hello. The problem is, this is... XXL. We don’t have it in our stock. Pen, please. No problem. I’ll write it down on your bill. Don't worry, come back in 10 days. We’ll exchange it for you. Though the rule is two days, but we'll make an exception. The stock will be there in two days. Great! Let the stock arrive! You can wear it all you want! Damn it! I care a damn to come and exchange it again! Put them back. The clothes have dried up. She should’ve folded them. But I’ve to do it on my own. Wonderful... When will they realize? Oh God... Even the bed is still undone! What is this! I look after the house, I cook. She just makes blouses and roams around. I’ve to do it all on my own... Decorating an elephant with a string! Wow! This is so pretty! A gift for topping the math test? Look at mine... Show me! Wow, these are so pretty. But what’s the point? You’ll never bring them out of the closet. That’s true, Rinku di. You get them tailored, but I don’t see you wear them. Please do wear. Please? Hmm. Here. Do wear them. Take this. Yes. The coffee was lovely. Bye. Okay. Muniya, see her out. Come. See you. Listen. Have I put on more weight? Be honest. Who told you so? My aunt was saying that I’ve become healthier. That I look sweet. Is it true? Is it possible? Do you look sweeter when you put on? Then I am far sweeter! Silly girl. Don’t pay heed to them. Come home for sweets one day. Bye. Tell Ma, I am going. Bye... Sure. Bye... Come again! I will... Hi, everyone! This is Biki! Biki Sen! And I know how eagerly you’ve been waiting for me! Today, we’ll talk about the Atkins diet. Which is mainly about less carbs. I mean rice, ‘rotis’, potatoes. You’ve to avoid those. And increase the protein intake. Now I’ll tell you what kind of protein you can go for. For protein, you can have chicken. You can have lamb. Among fishes, go for salmon, trout. Among dairy products, say... Greek yogurt. Avoid buying it from local confectioners. You can eat cheese and butter. In fact, even seafood! You think I’m kidding, right? Diet... Please get the door! You think I'm kidding, right? Hey! Did you get the door? All that food for such a strict diet? Guys, I am Biki! Biki Sen! And if I’m telling you to follow the Atkins diet... (doorbell) Why don’t you just get the door? When I tell you that you’ll get results from this diet in 2 weeks, you sure will! And like I say, tell yourself... Hey! Remember last night what you ate, because you can’t put on weight! Get the door! Ma, must you yell in the middle of a recording? Someone’s at the door! Check who it is. Who else? The culottes already arrived. Must be the spaghetti and shift dress. Why don’t you go, check? Shift dress? I know about shifting duties. What’s a shifting dress? Does it keep shifting? You really know nothing! Good that you ordered spaghetti. I’ve run out of noodles and pasta. Phullora Bhaduri? Dude, she's so hot! Walk straight ahead. You’ll see a worn down yellow house. That one. But it says 59... 59? 56. Move! Bro, fix it! Go, go! Did the spaghetti arrive? Want the one I'm wearing? So, take it! Spaghetti, my foot! Hi, this is Biki Sen... Continue. Phullora Bhaduri? My sister-in-law. Ah, I went into a different house by mistake. Biki Didi’s house, right? I don’t know her name. A slim-trim, pretty girl. Yes. Hmm, that's Biki Didi. Ah. What are you studying now? I’m in 7th standard. No way! You look old enough to be in 10th standard. You're mistaken. I’m in 7th standard. You’re lying. You’re in 10th standard. This parcel is for my sister-in-law, not Biki didi. I too study in 7th standard, not 10th standard. Pen. Boumoni... Boumoni... Oh, Boumoni... Look, what has come! A huge parcel for you! Boumoni! Look what I have here! What will come out of it? Magic? Exactly! Where’s the cutter? Here. It’s time for magic! Hocus pocus-gili gili... Abracadabra! And here we have... magic! Gogol... Brother’s home! Stand straight. Can’t you stand still? Good, a perfect fit. Ma, isn’t the colour nice? Nice. Is it a bigger size? Then, he can wear it till next year. Yes, I know my brother. Gogol dear, do you like it? Yes, I’ll wear it on Bengali New Year day! Bhaiya, what about the rest? Yes... First... This one is for Ma! Ma, look, a sari for you. You didn’t have this colour. Wow, it's nice. Hey! Come out, will you? Coming... Bhaiya... What about Boumoni? Oh no! I forgot! You have an efficient assistant. He’s asking me, “What about Boumoni?” Here. Gogol’s Boumoni, tell me if you like the sari. Oh my! And for you? I didn’t find anything nice for myself. So, I didn’t buy. A new parcel came in today, is it? How did you know? He is bursting the bubble wrap. Bhaiya! are you Feluda or Byomkesh? Neither of them. You could call me Sherlock Holmes. Sitting at home, playing the sleuth. Holmes at home! What a clever pun! I'll keep a note of it! Yes, but don’t forget that there’s an ‘L’ in Holmes. No, I’ll remember. A silent 'L'! You have good taste. I bought quite a bit of fabric. I’ve many orders coming up. Fabric colours? No, textile material. Why do a business where you've to spend so much? Look at my son. He works at a reputed clothing shop. Ma, please! Why do you do that business? If you rather have kids, we'll be a happy family. Isn’t it? What kind of tailoring work are you getting these days? Salwar-kameez? Blouses. No matter how you stitch those blouses, it’s no magic. A fat woman always looks fat. Fashion won’t help. Decorating an elephant with a string! People go into diets to lose weight. But Ma, people don’t wear fancy clothes to lose weight. Aren't fat girls supposed to wear blouses, you mean? And if she does like to... They hardly wear anything. Only strings! Upset because of what Ma said, right? Oh, come on, I hardly even listen. Mostly I’m thinking of my family. Otherwise, I think of new designs. You know what I think? Had I not brought you here, to Dhulishohor, you could’ve remained in Kolkata. Could’ve finished your designing course. And by now, you’d have become a great designer! Then I’d have missed out on this designer life, mister! Can I ask you something? Hmm? You really don’t regret it? Not at all. You know what, stitching gives you a lot of strength. It teaches you to believe, that you can. I can measure it, cut it, alter, fix and stitch my life... to fit my own liking. Stitching doesn’t teach you to have regrets. Lights. You still feel shy? Even if it’s me? I know it’s pointless But I still need you I know it’s pointless But my heart is clumsy Flowers shed off last night I know it’s pointless But you’re in the air I know it’s pointless But I like it this way I tie our moments of love To colourful ribbons I know it’s pointless... My heart fills with Tiny bubbles of joy, around you Stay close, stay beside me Stay, as the roads turn My heart fills with Tiny bubbles of joy, around you Stay close, stay beside me Stay, as the roads turn Oh my heart... Oh my heart You colour me in her hue Oh my heart... Oh my heart Why do you make me dream? I know it’s pointless But I still need you I know it’s pointless But my heart is clumsy Flowers shed off last night I know it’s pointless But you’re in the air I know it’s pointless But I like it this way I tie our moments of love To colourful ribbons I know it’s pointless... I stick to you, without a care Because I know Happiness lies here, with you Wonder if this is a fairy tale Having you in my life Is a dream come true You’ve woven a mirage In my eyes How are you tying me To yourself? I know it’s pointless But you’re in the air I know it’s pointless But I like it this way I tie our moments of love To colourful ribbons I know it’s pointless... My heart fills with Tiny bubbles of joy, around you Stay close, stay beside me Stay, as the roads turn My heart fills with Tiny bubbles of joy, around you Stay close, stay beside me Stay, as the roads turn Oh my heart... Oh my heart You colour me in her hues Oh my heart... Oh my heart Why do you make me dream? Listen... Wow! What’s cooking? Meat. Had some lying in the fridge. It’s your favourite dish. Just the way you like it. Fine, I’ll go bathe quickly. What were you saying? The towel's in the balcony, right? Yes. Slide your hand in. New clothes every three months. How will my son manage? Ma, ever thought how I will grow if he doesn't manage? Good morning, Gogol. Oh! Good morning! Sorry to disturb you. Behula aunty, do you have some eggs? Sure. How many? As you know, I’m on a strict diet. Four egg whites every morning. I mean... the white part of the egg. I have two eggs at home. I need two more. But Didi, what do you do with the yolk? Hey, shut up! Jabbering away! Thank God, your house is nearby. I've to direct people to your place for free, often. The game of 6 and 9 is taking a toll on me! And... Ma keeps telling me, I’m sure to find eggs here. You haven't served the food yet? Honestly... Oops! Apart from Bechu da... Hi! Everyone else in your family is a bit... Fat. Right? We may be fat. But we’re not losers. We have an amazing life. Thank you. Behula aunty, bye. Bye. She gave her so many eggs! Still struggling at the shop? Of course, the entire world is in recession. People are losing their jobs. What are you saying... Never know, they may fire me too. If not that, they’ll surely decrease my pay. How much will it decrease? I don't know yet, Ma. In fact, good that you're both here. I wanted to ask you... Ma, I give you 7,000 rupees monthly... Right? Try to manage the groceries and your prayer accessories from it. Don’t give me more. And you too try... to manage Gogol's school fee, allowance, your allowance, etc. from your 7,000. Just for a month. You see, I’ve to look into the maintenance too. The house is not in a good condition as it is. I too am trying. I'll try to save up on tiffin and travel. No way. You don’t have to save up on travel. We’ll manage in 7,000. Oh but... What happened? Gogol, where are you... The food... Ma. Why are you reacting like this? Ma? Ma, I have some money in my piggy bank. I can buy you God’s offerings from this. Sit and eat. Don’t act smart. Don't get up while eating. Sit. Phullora, where did you buy this from? It’s lovely! An anniversary gift from him. Really pretty, right? You know how much I love my coffee. I know. Lots of milk. 2½ spoons of sugar. I know exactly! Will the neckline be this deep? No, go deeper... No, that’s it. This much? Done? What about hand measurements? Are you in a hurry to go somewhere? No... But I’ve to make a video for the cookery show, on YouTube. What! You never showed it to us! We didn't know she has a channel! Why, show us! Right now! You want to see? Now, add a bit of olive oil. Let me see. Then add the whipped eggs. Where are you? Where’s your face? It’s only hands. Come on! Who would subscribe if they saw my figure? Only if I was slimmer... People assume fat people have heart ailments, cholesterol... and many more diseases. You think the petite ones have it easier? I agree, that we should exercise and maintain our weight. Check what we eat... But I’ve been making clothes for years... So many clients... They are naturally chubby. They put on a little and they look fat. Doesn’t mean they are sick. Depression puts on weight too. True. Right. My husband doesn’t yet know about the channel. Let it work, then I’ll break it. Won’t he be happy to know? Not a fat wife’s flop show. Let it become a hit. Seema boudi’s life is all about her husband. Come on. And what about you? She gets clothes tailored but never really wears them! As you know, I do photoshoots for make-up companies. It’s mostly, eyes, hair, eyelashes, nails... What if my clothes are visible? So, I make those clothes. And they taunt me a lot at home for my weight. “Need two chairs?” “You eat so much!” “What about this... What about that...” Hey! You’re making good money selling make-up. Yet, they still taunt you? I am jobless. What do you mean? Aruna di, housework is a big deal. Look, I too feel like doing something to earn like you all. To live on my own terms. Skipping, cycling like before. I used to cycle really well, you know! So, what if I am fat now, I’m still quite fit! You’ve no idea! She’ll bring on the munchies now. Big deal! It’s just munchies! Have some! Ah, Phullora... I got this magazine from Kolkata. For new designs. Show me? Check out the designs. Thank you... Wow... So pretty! Make me this one someday? How intricate, how did they make it? You can do it. Bouma... Yes? The next ‘kirtan’ we're doing... will happen at Jagmohan Babu’s house. He is so well off! And handsome too. Tall and well built... We’ve decided to gift him something. But how will I afford? Babu is asking us to cut expenses. What are you looking at? Bouma... where’s your mind all the time? In a different world! Ma, should I make you a collared blouse? You’ll look very pretty. That’s what I was thinking. You’ve nice, broad shoulders. Good lord, we’ll gift Jagmohan Babu a blouse I guess! Does seem so. Gogol... Hmm? Tell me. What is the English translation for this line? 'There was a dog’. Should I say it like a story? Go on. Once upon a time, there was a dog. Hmm. (speaks Bengali) The dog was very naughty! (speaks Bengali) One day, the dog wished... Wow, good. “wished...” (speaks Bengali) Umm... ...wished to open a Facebook account. Hmm. (speaks Bengali) By mistake... What? Louder. Can’t hear. By mistake, he sent a friend request to his elder brother. Elder brother... (speaks Bengali) Hey! Where are you? And then the brother understood... that this was his younger sibling. 'Naughty' younger sibling... who was not yet 18 years old. Hmm. Get up. Sit. Sit! Your English is fine. Your intelligence, even finer. But slow down, buddy. What does Boumoni call you? 'Google'! Does Google ever lie? No. It says the truth? Hmm. Show me. Hmm. The translation is nice. Practise this: Whatever you find... A newspaper, a book, a pamphlet or magazine. Translate it. Whatever I find I’ll translate? Yes, our teachers used to say so. You’ll learn a language better by translating. I saw your writing. There is a ‘P’ in receipt. Ah, right! It’s not pronounced. But it’s there, it’s silent. Hmm. Shona. Yes? Quickly pack 1 kg ‘Gobindobhog’ rice grains. 200 gms 'batashas'. I kg sugar. 100 gms of 'nokuldana', cashews and raisins for 10 bucks. Cashews and raisins aren't worth so less. Give me a discount then. Put it on the due list. Two chocolates for me. No, take lozenges. Add it. Okay. Give me quinoa. I don’t have it. Why! Even roadside shops keep it these days. But it’s very costly. Listen. Hmm? What do you eat to maintain such a lovely figure? Oh, please, aunt. Not everyone can achieve my kind of a figure. Besides, I am ‘THE Biki Sen’! Forget about me. But you can also try hyper-liquid diet. Huh? Um... fruit juice. Only fruit juice throughout the day. Ah! Everyone is doing it these days. Vegetarians are doing it. Oldies are doing it. Even widows like you can do it. Hyper-liquid diet. Bring some quinoa. Hyper... Hyper-liquid diet... Ma, the power's gone... Not again! Switch on the mobile torch. I'll light a lamp. Coming, wait. Hey, when did you come home? A while ago. Why did’t you call me? You know, when I see you dreaming... I just love it! I don't feel like interrupting. You love me so much? You doubt it? Not just you. I love your dreams too. What is this... Fashion influencers? Is it an influential thing? Extremely. You know who they are? What to wear, what’s in vogue at present... They’ve a huge influence on it. Know how much they charge to wear an attire? They charge to wear clothes eh? Of course! Why can't they? Sport stars and movie stars charge to appear in ads. It’s the same. Hmm. Obviously. But, Madam... Over me... you have an immense influence. You’re no less than an influencer then! You know, Rinku di came today. I think her husband doesn’t like the clothes she gets made. Her photoshoots too. And the make-up business... Not everyone is like you. Right? No. Aruna di, Rinku di, Seema boudi... The things they have to live with... So... you’re so good at stitching... Why can’t you stitch together their tattered lives? ‘Fashion is not about being slim or fat. It means, to decorate yourself as you wish. Like we decorate our houses. Not all houses are the same. But we still decorate them. Fashion is the same thing. Just find out which colours and cuts suit your figure.’ It’s time to weave dreams With red and blue strings Of desire It’s time to weave dreams With red and blue strings Of desire Put a string of imagination To your needle And a mix bag of colours Begin to play! I drown in the story all day Painting intricate tales Of various kinds! Wayward strings I end up poking my finger Wayward strings I end up poking my finger Yet, I find reasons to play along It’s time to weave dreams With red and blue strings Of desire In colourful hues of clothes I cover my melancholic heart Unmindful, yet intricately drawn Are my dreams Of various designs and fits What if a few dreams come true? I want to indulge In that thought Enthralled by its magic Wayward strings I end up poking my finger sometimes Wayward strings I end up poking my finger sometimes Yet, I find reasons to play along It’s time to weave dreams With red and blue strings Of desire It’s time to weave dreams With red and blue strings Of desire Boumoni! Oh Boumoni! Mr Google, what new info do you bring today? You were writing about fat people’s fashion in this notebook. Why did you take my notebook? It’s very bad. I don’t like this! Boumoni, wait, I’ll help you. Just hear me out first. Bhaiya told me, whatever I find, a paper, magazine, whatever... I must translate. Because that’s how you ace a language. He told me that too. That’s what I did. I translated your writing... What did you do? Uh... Boumoni, ‘fat’ means, fat. Chubby. And like Kumar Sanu sings ‘Fatafati’... It’s pronounced ‘Phataphati’. How's this related to translation? Whatever. I spelt it with an ‘F’. I made an Instagram account called ‘From Fat to Fatafati’! I translated your write up and posted it over there. And now, when I checked my phone... You have so many followers now! 4,625 followers! Can you imagine, Boumoni? They’re asking for a pic of yours. Let me click one. No! Why are you hiding away? They’ll call me fat. Show it to me first. Only a few will say that. Do think about them! Look, they’re already saying they want more such articles. They want to see your pic! How can you not put it up? Boumoni, you’re famous! As famous as Kumar Sanu! Boumoni, you’re famous! I’ve told you everything. You do photo-shoots, right? Your pics are so good! Please, Rinku di, help me with a pic for Instagram. Want me to make a joke of my fat-self? Come on! Do one thing, ask Aruna di or Seema boudi. They may do it... I asked everyone. No one is agreeing to do it. Don’t have to show face. Just wear the clothes. But to exhibit the clothes, the body will be visible too. How can I hide that? Anyway, lots of milk and 2½ spoons of sugar, right? Ma cannot, aunty. Ma cannot do it. Muniya, go, study. Here, I’ll show you why she cannot! Muniya! No, let her see! Can you see it, why? Want to see more? Come. Come on! Come, see. Look. Now, do you see? Take care of your mother. It doesn’t matter to me anymore, Phullora. But I saved up to buy those make-up sets... Rinku di... What matters and what doesn’t... What should matter... and what should not... Do give it a thought. You heard the news? They fired Mr Ghosh yesterday. Huh? They have more names on the list. Mr Ghosh? Now, that's scary! I’ve to take to the streets! Hey, am I to eat without chillies? Getting it... Had I been a camel, I could store food. Only cockroaches can survive this. We'll starve to death! He may not be a camel. But Bachaspati has a savings account. He doesn’t have to feed himself. Savings account? Hmm! His mom, his wife and his brother. They have it all stored! Give me a bigger piece of fish... Isn't that better? In such tough times... If my loved ones... like my mom, wife and brother stand beside me with their savings, I am sorted. Imagine! Salutations to To the name of Krishna Are you done, Boumoni? I am waiting, open up! Can I come in, Boumoni? Hey... No! How long will you take? It’s been a while, Boumoni! Hail, Krishna! Hail! Hail, Ram! Hail! You said it'll take 10 minutes! What's taking so long? Hail, Krishna! Hail! Ugh! Boumoni, they are done. Please open up now! Hail, take the name of Hari Hail, take the name of Hari Boumoni, open, fast! No! Hail, take the name of Hari! Fit me, please! Oh Lord! Serving snacks? Ah! Boumoni, open quickly! I’m missing out on the food! Boumoni, make it quick! No, wait. Lovely snacks! Very tasty, isn't it? Didi, won’t you eat? You’ve arranged for some great food. My stomach’s unwell. Ah. Oops, Ma can’t eat. She’s on Biki Didi’s hyper-liquid thing. Hey! Shut up! Always interfering when elders talk! Off you go! Acting smart! What was he saying? Huh? What did he say? He was saying that I have hyper-tension. But you have a good son, a talented daughter-in-law. She’s so pretty. You’ll become a granny soon. Don’t take tension. Listen up, everyone! Jagmohan Babu will be gifted a silk kurta. We all just need to pool in 500 rupees each. Are you all okay with it? Yes. What about you? Huh...? Yes, sure. Are you done yet? I’m coming in now. I’m opening the door. Damn... ‘Fatafati’! Let me click a pic! Hey! Show me... See, you’re looking so pretty! See? I’ll post it now! No way, don't post it! Why not? Your Bhaiya doesn't know yet! He doesn't know about it! Give it to me! I posted it! Yay! Boumoni, you’re Agatha Mystery! Hey, Gogol... Gogol, come here! What mystery? Mystery? Well, that it is! The mystery thickens! Dance, song and recitation like every year. Anything else? Yes, if anyone wants to do something new, speak up. Um, I have something to say. If possible, can we organize a fashion show this year? Wow! Great idea! We can do that! Yes! Yes. But where will we get the models from? Biki is the only one in our neighbourhood. But you see, it's just us here... Zip it. Let me talk. You see, it’s all meant for the neighbourhood. Same goes for the fashion show. Let’s just ask which of us want to participate. Me! I want to participate! Sit down, dear girl. What! You can’t do it. Your figure is... I mean... It’s difficult. Um, fine, no problem. Biki can train everyone. And our Rinku is great with make-up. She'll do everyone's make-up! There you go! And... the fashion show clothes... That responsibility is Phullora’s. Absolutely! Wow! That’s great. Great suggestion, Bechu da. I’m sure, Phullora di can make great tents, isn’t it? By the way, what will you name your brand? Let me suggest one. Uh... ‘Motamuti’? If I train you all, I’ll source in a big brand. After all, I am ‘THE Biki Sen’. Neither me, nor my team will wear a local tailor’s work. Right, Bechu da? Bechu da! Why don't you walk with me in the show? Exactly! You, Prabal da and Rajat da... Walk the ramp with me! And we will have an all men’s fashion show! And I will be ‘THE showstopper’! Huh? Woah! Won’t that be great? Wait. It's just a friendly show. All in the neighbourhood. It's a homely fashion show. Fat or slim, does it matter? It doesn’t matter if you’re fat or slim in a fashion show? I see... If it doesn’t, why don't we... prove it through Phullora di? Sure. Right, Phullora di? Let's show her. Go on, Phullora. Yes. Do it. Me? Just go ahead. Do it. No big deal, come on! Did you hear that? You're a dream husband! Disgusting! Please scoot. From that line there... walk up to this line, here. Like this. Please come, Phullora di. Go ahead. Come up. You can do it. Get up. Phullora! Phullora! Hey, wait a second! I'm... I'm extremely sorry! Very sorry, my bad. What happened? She's taking off her shoes... Heels! Heels? Yes. Essentials of a fashion show. Hmm? You can do it. You see, she’s not used to wearing heels. Careful. Don’t trip and fall. Be careful. Do it. She is ready! Come on! Walk straight! Yes! Great, applaud please! Bechu da, clap for her! Look straight! Straight! That's it... Take it slow. No, not from here. From the top. From the line I drew. Okay? Everyone, clap for her? Come on! Slowly. Yes. Careful. Look straight. Yes, look up! Very good! Phullora, hey! Oops! That must have hurt? You poor thing. Start again please. Hey, Biki. Hey! You’re crossing the limit now. But you asked me to teach her. Start afresh every time you trip, okay? Start afresh. Bechu da, cheer her up, will you! There you go. Hey! Phullora! Are you hurt? Oh no! Oops, poor you! Did you twist an ankle? You must be hurt! Are you? I hope now you see why, a fashion show isn’t for the fat lot. Hmm? Right, Phullora di? Those fishes are worth at least 600, Bechu da. You bargain a lot these days. Don’t whine me, Tapan. Do one thing. Take the Rohu. I’ll give it to you for 200. It’s a Sunday. Mutton is too costly. The amount you’re asking for... We will have to give up eating fish altogether. Bachaspati, I wanted to ask you. I hear your wife tripped over trying to walk the ramp? Feed her some protein. It will give her strength. Give him ‘Singi’ fish. ‘Singi’? No, give me this ‘Bhetki’. You want ‘Bhetki’? Yes. ‘Bhetki’? Peel the scales... Well then... Special attraction of our Bengali New Year programme! First-ever fashion show in Dhulishohor! Boumoni! Oh Boumoni! Boumoni! Stop pestering me all the time! Wait, just see this first! What? Fashion designer Mallika Gupta Tweeted your Insta link! You’re right! And look what she writes: ‘Miss Fatafati can change tomorrow’s fashion.' There's more. 'Never seen anyone celebrate plus-size bodies like this. We have to rethink about body types.’ Look, other portals have shared your pic. And they’ve written: ‘Who is this mysterious Miss Fatafati?’ Now we must tell your Bhaiya! Yes, we must! Please drive faster! Watch your step. Yes... Your brother is home. How do you know? Living room's light is turned on. I'll give him the news. Where’s everyone? You mustn't tell him, I will! Bhaiya, you know... What happened? ‘Notice: Maa Tara Clothing house closing down.’ They shut down? Why do you still look sad? Please smile, dear. Don’t worry so much, Phullora. You’ll find a way. Yes. You too earn, right? Don't worry! I don't earn enough to... Hey! Saw what Biki has done on Facebook? What? She posted a pic with Muniya. Beside the ramp. With a caption: ‘Fatsoing away!’ Imagine! Show me. Here. She’s got some guts! And an obnoxious ego! So what if my girl is a bit chubby? Don't get me started on her. Biki is always offering lifts to everyone. Even my husband! Does she really own a car? Oh chuck it! She rents them. I know who rents them for her outside Dhulishohor. She’s quite shady. Really. Forget it. Lots of milk, 2½ spoons of sugar. Coffee for you, Laura darling. Who is Laura? Why, haven’t you heard Biki call her? 'Phul-Laura'! So, I called her Laura! You're impossible! Cheer up now, dear. Now that our fatso gang has come together, how can we not raise a toast? Cheer, we must! Do it! Pick up the coffee cup! Yes, pick it up! Come on, cheers! Cheers! How much for the prawns? 400. And the ‘Pabda’? 500. And ‘Bata’? 160. Take the ‘Chapra’, it's nice. Hey! Shopping on a Monday morning! Oh yes... Every day is Sunday for you now. For both of us. Nope. I’m off to Kolkata. I’ve sorted it out... And you? Joining your wife’s business? She handles it well on her own. Ah. Do keep a check on the electricity bill. Which fish do you want? ‘Bata’. 'Bata'? ‘Bata’. Mr Google! The translations are going great. ‘Two percent students in your school have red hair. If there are 700 students in the school, how many have red hair?’ Boumoni, how many have red hair? Many... Come on... Oh my God, look! I got a mail from Fashionista brand. If I put up a pic in their XXL clothes, I’ll make 45,000 minus 10% TDS. 45,000 minus 10% TDS. How much is that? It’s a lot. One tight slap! Come and check out the good news! Show me! This is great! Time I told your brother now! Once Bhaiya knows, will Boumoni’s face be visible? Here's my share. Okay, 500 each, right? I’ll get the snacks. Hmm. Here, take my share. Give this. Okay... Listen. What is wrong with you? Babu lost his job... Has there been any trouble? Don’t worry at all. We’ll pool in for your 500. Pay it back later. No, that's not done. Look, it’s Phullora who tailored this blouse for me. We will buy the silk fabric. And she'll stitch the kurta. Won’t add the making charge to the collection. That’s your share. Then, you won’t be sad, right? I... You know, I... You see, I am a fashion influ... I... You know, I am Miss... Mrs Phullora Bhaduri. Nice to meet you. God knows what she mumbles. I'm Miss Fatafati! Listen, I am... I am... I am Miss Fatafati. Listen... What is this? You think I don't notice? Whenever I spend money you tuck 500 rupees in my wallet. I counted it yesterday. And now... Why are you doing this? Pitying me? Husband lost his job, yet you’re earning. So, pitying me? Just standing beside you. In order to stand by me, you must realize... if at all it's a help or mere insult! Why are you doing it? I’ll serve it, sit. Where’s everyone else? No one is home. Where are they? Muniya Didi is ill. Ma and Boumoni went there. Asked you not to wait for dinner. You start. Bhaiya, won’t you eat? Eat, I’ll join in. Eat slowly. Thank God, you came. Neither Aruna di nor Seema boudi were available on call. Please don’t be formal. Just pray she recovers. When will her dad be back? He is out on office work. I’ve to handle this alone! Rinku di! Doctor said it's stomach infection and low pressure. She'll be fine. Get up, dear. Drink this, you’ll feel okay. Come on. She heard from Biki, you see... that models starve themselves! Zero figure, my foot! She has stopped eating, aunt! If I force her, she says she ate out with friends. She lies! What if something happens to her? We better go now. Let's go. Ma, I think I will stay back here, tonight. Let me be with her? Okay. Bye, dear. Hey, you. Miss Zero figure. Get up and drink this. Let’s normalize the pressure. Drink it. Damn you, sick woman! Turned my life into hell! I work hard throughout the month. Do you care? I bring you the money on time. And here you are, enjoying life! It’s all my headache, right? My life is ruined! All you do it eat! And bloat up like an elephant! You don’t even care if the girl’s eaten properly! And your make-up business is another burden! Leave that. Why, you doll up and click pics! She's learning from you! Leave that. Irresponsible woman! Please! It’s all my responsibility, not yours, right? My responsibility? Well, that's what you're partying on! I saved up for it. I stay out working. So, think you can have your way? Even I know what work you do, dad! I see! Going that far! The guts you have! Hey! What the hell are you doing! Ma! Don't hit Ma! You’re to blame! Muniya, go away! Years ago, I should’ve nipped it in the bud! What a crappy marriage this is! Ugly, talent-less wife! One kick and... A kick or a stick, let the police decide. A lawsuit will land you in jail. Hope you know? I have the video. I’ll show it to the police if Rinku di wants. Bye. When will you come? You have mails pouring in. Come fast! Until you come back I can't reply to them. Oh wow! Didi, your daughter-in-law... To be honest... 500 is too less, the making charge of this is at least 1,000! You ended up paying more! Go, gift it to him. Right. Yes. Go. Hail, Lord Krishna. It's all his mercy. Have you all taken the offerings? Please go, eat. Eat well, please. Greetings. Brother, this is for you. Thank you so much! Hello? Hello. This is Jagmohan Dastidar. Yes, tell me? I must tell you something if you don’t mind. Of course, please feel free. It’s such a nice gift you all gave me, the kurta! Money can’t buy it all, you see. I hardly buy anything for myself these days. I hear the kurta is handmade by your daughter-in-law? I’d be honoured if I could do something for your family. What are you saying, Sir! An acquaintance told me, a clothing showroom in Kolkata has a job opening. Your son has years of experience. So, I was thinking if... he can apply... ask him to call me... I'll let you know where to mail his CV. Bye. Thanks. Hail, Lord Krishna. I'd like to think I got the job from my own caliber. Because of my CV or my experience. Not someone's pity... ‘Arombor’ is a big showroom. I saw the pics on the internet. It’s at Garia, Mahamayatala... If the world had so much pity, things would be different. I don’t want to be a burden on you, Phullora. I couldn’t survive on people’s pity anymore. Never imagined I’ll leave Dhulishohor one day. I guess it’s better to go to Kolkata. Not all expressions of respect are the same. But classifying it as an insult... or pity isn't justified. No... I... It’s done. The checkered shirt is nice. Buy branded shirts when you reach Kolkata. They wouldn't pay up! Bus stand? Yes. Put this inside please. Hey, wait. Bechu da, where are you off to? Kolkata. Ah. I’m going that way too. Where in Kolkata? Towards Garia. Ah, Garia. I’m going to Esplanade. Voila magazine? You must have heard of them? I’m going to their office. I’ve to reach there soon. Or else I’d have dropped you. It's okay. Yes. Drive please. Bye! Okay. See you. Okay. Don’t worry at all. And... take care of your health. Eat on time. Go safely. Take care of Ma. And... work on your spellings, I... Bhaiya, I’ll practise my spelling. You take care. See you. Bless him, Goddess. As far as you go I will come along But how? But how? Answer me, beloved You’re moving away Why? Why? Like a winter leaf Silence falls I stare into the distance For an answer Please come Please come to me We will flow like a river Surging in the monsoon Please come Please come to me Let me hug you Through shade and sunshine As far as you go I will come along But how? But how? Answer me, beloved You’re moving away Why? Why? I utter your name By mistake I’ve lost control On my heart I won’t let you go So, I think Yet, why? Why’d I let you go? A moist breeze from the past That I have left behind Why did it gush past me When you are not beside? Please come Please come to me We will flow like a river Surging in monsoon Please come Please come to me Let me hug you Through shade and sunshine As far as you go I will come along But how? But how? Answer me, beloved You’re moving away Why? Why? Hey! What happened? What's wrong? Watch out! Pull over! Steer to the left! What’s going on? Careful... A flat tyre? Let's see. Why is he driving like this? Do you want to kill us? Good Lord, can't you drive slow? Open it up. What is it, bro? Has it broken down? Let us check first. Is it the tank? Seems so. I told you, let's take the train! No! You had to take the bus! We need to fix the engine. It will take time. Damn it! We don't know how long it'll take. You can take another bus. Let's get off. What nonsense... Same story every day! Get a dry piece of cloth. Yes... How long will you take? It'll take time, brother. What the hell! How can I take another bus now? Be responsible and put us on another bus then? What the hell! Huh? Give me the bus owner's number! How strange is this! What do I do now? Damn! Your engine breaks down often! Let me help you. Yes, please. Thank you so much. Welcome. People are supposed to help each other out, right? Bechu da? Yes. You took this bus, but how... I reached the bus stand early, so I took an early bus. Come on. Ah... You see, I... Ouch! Careful, did you hurt yourself? Is it paining? I’m okay. Huh? Not your fault. The path of life isn’t as smooth as the ramp, right? You see, my car broke down all of a sudden today, so I... I understand. Give me your bag. Come on. No, it's okay. Come on, give it. The weight of life shifts unpredictably. You never know the brunt you may have to bear. Right, Bikiranbala? What? Listen, look... I know Esplanade is far away from Garia, but not that far away. They’ll take time. I guess we should wait. When the next bus comes, we can go together. I’ll load your luggage onto the next bus. It'll help you. My car is on the way... I'll get my luggage. We're stranded now... ‘Batasha’ and incense. What else? 1 kilo pack of flour and vegetable oil. Flour and vegetable oil. Here. Anything else? Listen. Yes? Do you have Koena? Koena Mitra? No! So? That thing Biki was looking for. Ma, it’s quinoa. Not Koena. She means quinoa. No, aunt. I don’t sell that. It’s very costly. No point. And listen. Your due list is getting longer. If you don’t pay now I’ll be in trouble. Ask your son to pay on phone? Okay. Here. Let's go. Ma, they said we've to pay the session fee by the 13th. 30,000 rupees. And there’s a new rule. Not only cheque or cash, we can pay online too now. No problem... So, they kept saying that no matter what, no payments will be accepted after the 13th. So, we have to pay up by the 13th anyhow. Ma! Is it serious, doctor? Since when is it happening? Today is the first time she fainted. What kind of food does she eat? Of late, she’s not eating well. Soups and sherbets... Why would she eat? She was on a hyper-liquid diet. What! Biki Didi told Ma that she can lose weight with that diet. She was doing that. I understand. Get this test done. I think it’s a sodium-potassium imbalance. And she’s talking incoherently. Give her salt-sugar water or ORS. She’ll be fine. Should I give her now? Yes, you can. You don’t want to put her in a hospital. So, hire a nurse at home for 20 days at least. Because she needs proper care now. Besides, her age is a factor. She was on a liquid diet. If her pressure falls suddenly, she could collapse any moment. So, be careful. Hmm? Why didn’t you tell me? Sorry, Boumoni. Miss Fatafati is a secret I keep for you. Similarly, the diet was a secret I kept for Ma. Good Lord! Hi, this is Biki. Biki Sen! And here I come with my new video for you all! Today, we will talk about intermittent fasting. Complete fasting post dinner, for 16 hours. You have eight hours a day, to eat. As I say, remember, last night what you ate. Because you just can't put on weight! Reply to this mail from Fashionista. Write that I have one condition. Keep my identity hidden. And, don’t tell your brother about Ma’s condition. He will worry there. Okay, Miss Phulu, no tension. Come. This is our ground floor. This one's for women. The floors above are for men and kids. All the best! Work hard and well, okay? And you are to report to our manager. Okay? Come. I’ll introduce you to the manager. Come. Good morning, sir. Manager Babu. Yes, sir? New member of your team. Bachaspati Bhaduri. Listen. Explain his job to him. I’ll talk to you later. Bachaspati, put in your best. We need to talk later, okay? Hmm. Go on. Gave up Dhulishohor for Kolkata? Huh? Look, you’re an experienced store manager. The stock details are here... And the electric... Bill. I remember. Better do. This is where I work. Show me. Let me turn the camera. Here, see! Wow! It’s a huge shop! Isn’t it? There are many more floors above this one. Where is Ma? Ma? Yes, where is she? She is praying. Let’s show Ma. She’ll be happy. Bathing! How can we show her? She is in the loo. Bathing. Bathing? But you just... Okay, bye! Huh? Hey... Hello? Hey... What? They credited the money! Really? Yes, really! Hello. Hmm. I sent money. Got it? Hmm. I got 25,000 after all deductions. Could’t send more than 15,000. Ma had some dues at the shop. Please take care of it. It’s going fine here. I got the house rent to settle for 3,000 rupees. And... I need... 24 rupees for travel every day. Not a big deal really. 24 every day, adds up to 720 each month, right? How will you eat in Kolkata for 6,000 rupees a month? It’s good enough for me. You know, the showroom is huge. I saw it. ‘Arombor’. I Googled it. Yes, there are different floors for everything. I mean, one for the kids. One for men. And they have the biggest one for women. Lots of things! What about fat women? Are fat women any less beautiful? Hello... I don’t get to talk to Ma. How is she? She’s good. And... you? Won’t you tell me? Still nursing the wound? Hey... I've stitched my wound. Oh, welcome, superstar! The show’s a hit! Rather, superhit! Isn’t it? It was a good idea to invite guests. A nutritionist, a model. The audience didn’t reject me because I’m fat. What say? Hence, you deserve it first. Her husband is proud of her too! If we pool in one more guest, we’re sorted. Who do you mean? You tell her. Miss Fatafati! Not now. Chuck that for now. Why? In spite of last year's recession, our organization, Mohini & Co. has profited quite a bit. So, the administration wants to put up a much grander annual fashion show. To increase our brand visibility. We must hire a bigger venue this time. Are we launching a new collection? Fall-Winter and Abhishek Dutta’s clothing line is there. What else can we... How about an XL collection? An XL collection? Good idea. Won't it be nice? Great idea! Putting the savings account to good use eh? Rubbish... Let me know if you can think of more. Okay, sir. Sure, sir. Miss Fatafati, Sir. XL model. Nice. She’s quite famous these days. Should we contact her? Very good idea. Contact her right away. Thank you, Sir. I’ve already spoken to Sonam Ray. The showstopper. Coordinate with her. Sonam Ray is a busy model. So? She’s signed some films as well. If she comes late, we’ll land in trouble. Pay her in advance. Send in the money already. Okay. And listen... If this show turns out to be a hit... I’ll look into your promotion. Thank you, Sir! Boumoni, 13th is the last date to pay the school fees. Session fees, right? 30,000 rupees? Hmm! It’s sorted. Mohini & Co. sent this mail. Boumoni, you really are amazing! They say, if you walk the ramp... you’ll get 50,000 rupees and you’ll get to go to Kolkata! Tell them about the precondition. What do I write? They’ve to send the address, and you can’t talk on phone. They should mail you. Right? Yes. I’ll do that. Boumoni, what will you tell Bhaiya? It'll be a surprise... Wants to surprise her husband, is it now! Thank God, we didn’t do such vain things. Our life was much more peaceful. Bouma... Hmm? why go all alone? Tell Babu. He'll arrange something for you. No way, Ma. Please don’t tell him even if he calls you. I have something to give you. Huh? Come here. I’ve to give you something. A surprise! Ma’am, the feature we’re doing on the upcoming models... Can we include Miss Fatafati in it? XL models aren’t common. XL model? Yes, Ma’am. As in, you want to lose weight. But you can’t, so you say, “Love my curves”! Right? Miss Fatafati has soothed fat women’s inferiority complexes. Fashion is not an antiseptic cream. No honey, leave it. Icy... cold towel? Ah! Towel soaked in ice? It’ll be done, madam, don’t worry. Yes. Warm... chicken salad? Madam, please speak to my subordinate. Bachaspati Bhaduri. He’s in charge of it. Okay, Madam. It will be done... Yes, sir. Yes. Sonam Ray confirmed. Hello, yes, tell me. How are you, Bechu da? Who is this? Oh, come on, Bechu da. Biki here! Biki Sen. Ah. It’s you. I didn't realize. I got a bit confused. No one calls me Bechu here. Um... How are you doing? Bikiranbala... Bechu da... It’s Biki. Only Biki. You must’ve heard, the show your company is organizing... I'll be walking the ramp there. Yes. I got the list of the others who are walking... But that fat girl... What’s her name again? Can't you guys... chuck her from it? As you know, on principle, I don’t walk the ramp with fat people. Who will walk, who won’t, who will be hired or chucked, it’s not in my hands. Besides, the XL collection is very important for us. We do need a model for it. A face. Gaining all that weight within such little time... Will you be able to do it? No, won't be possible for you, right? She's your face? Yes. My foot! She’s so ashamed of her body, she can’t even show her face! What face? So, you came along! Not just for the trip... I've come for good. Come on up! Come. Hey! Muniya! Didn’t you say... I should think about what is right and what isn’t? So, I gave it a thought. Enough now. Time to find a new way. Hey, help me. Ah! You're here too! Come on! I thought I’ll come along. Good. My husband insisted. I keep cooking all the time. Let me put it here. It's got food. He said, “Go for a trip.” So I came. Got it? Come, sit. Let's get going then! Let’s go! So nice, you all came! Yes! What about Aruna di? You’re right... Aruna di... Hey, why didn’t Aruna di come? Oh no... We'll miss her a lot. Would’ve been so much better with all four of us. We write our new story Just how we like it Reaching for the sky From a crowded bus Like the deity, riding the lion With a trident in her hand! We fight alone We search for our life Come on, girl! Find your own life! Let the world talk Wipe your tears, come on! Come on, girl! Find your own life! Let the world talk Wipe your tears, come on! Care a damn for the world Spit over it and walk! Its rules are all outdated Spit over it and walk! A new wind Rowing through the sky It's time for victory! Hey, isn't that Aruna di? Oh, yes! Yes! There, look! Where is she? Stop the bus, please! We don't know where it takes us Aha, come on, let's go Queen Phullora! We pay no heed To the world anymore We surge forward With dreams in our eyes We shall win over your sky We shall! We spread our hands Like wild wings unfolding Look ahead Good times are calling out to us Oh, Phullora, dear Phullora! We don't know Where this road ends Come on, surge ahead Queen Phullora! We don't care what the world says Anymore! Oh, Phullora, dear Phullora! We don't know Where this road ends Come on, surge ahead Queen Phullora! We don't care what the world says Anymore! We don't see, nor indulge In any negative feelings We find our own way To a 'Fatafati' life! We don't see, nor indulge In any negative feelings We find our own way To a 'Fatafati' life! Hello, Vaishali, how are you? Are you done? Yes... Like this. Please hold this for a bit. Sure. Listen, babe, for the last show we did... Just put this up... Huh? Like this. Okay. I'll quickly get back to you. Please get me the outfit. Anupam, we're going for top-buns? Which base should I use? Use this one. Hi. Hello, looking for someone? We're team Fatafati. I see, please come with me. Please come. They've done it up so well! This way. Come. Ma, look... This way. Let's go. Oh wow! Phullora, it's all for you! You get it? Icy cold towels. Here you go. Bechu da. Anything else? Put it over here. Come on, put it. Come inside. Come. Move and hold... And turn! Give me the mood! Phullora, let's go. Come on. Yes, let's go. It's this way. You've to do your make-up. Come. Turn again, hold, move forward... And hold it, and turn again. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Hey, Andy. Hey, I’m coming. Hello. Wait a sec. How are you, dear? I’m good. Did you get the gossip? Rita slept with my ex-boyfriend. What! Listen, there’s a quick change. I’m doing three for you. And two for you. And then you’re going to another position. This is done. Hey! Stop fidgeting. What’s with you? Are you tense? You look so sweet! Still worried? Well, the enigma that your flab is! 1, 2, 3, 4. Get me the other four girls, please. All okay? Any problem? Eh... Do you want something? Tea, coffee or cold drinks? Madam, what about you? Some coffee would be fine. My coffee is like... Lots of milk. 2½ spoons of sugar, right? So? I surprised you? Hey? Why are you weeping? You’ll spoil your make-up... A fat wife. Just a local tailor from a small town. Is this pity? Look up. The tear will spill over. Tissue. Here, take. How sweet! Had people been so pitiful, the world would be different. Far prettier. Okay. Come on, fast! Why did you assume that I won’t understand? I know you better than you, Phullora. Take this. Please edit your write-ups on Miss Fatafati's account. Those typical spelling mistakes of Gogol! I know them the best! You're impossible! Good. There you go. Now that you’re smiling! Wait, have your coffee. It's ready. Buck up! You've to walk the ramp! Anything for you all? What a splendid collection! Let’s give a big round of applause for designer Abhishek Dutta! Wait. Wow, Bechu da. Weren’t you saying, it’s a very big show! It’s not in your hands to hire or chuck anyone? Here you are, exhibiting your fat wife! Should I call the manager? Well, he must know what's going on here! I’ll handle this! Someone call the manager! Bikiranbala, listen! What happened? Wait! I will tell you what happened! Bachaspati Bhaduri brought his fat wife to do the ramp walk. Biki, listen... Stop. I am talking! A fatso will walk along with me, and I’ll allow it? No way! Don't you know? Don’t you know how heavy your wife is? She’ll break the stage! None of us will be able to walk after that. What happened, madam? Any problem? Here you are. Look, do you know her? Who? An amateur tailor from a small town. The fat wife of Bachaspati Bhaduri. She is not a model. Is she not Miss Fatafati? Yes, she is Miss Fatafati! Ah. Is it! Wow. But she can’t walk the ramp as a model in today’s show. What! Why! Thank God! Sonam Ray can’t come. She’s flying to Mumbai to meet a producer. The administration took a last-minute decision. The showstopper for the show will be... Miss... Fatafati. What! Wow! What? One minute! You see if the XL collection is a hit, more people will buy. Hence the decision. Please get ready. The 2nd round will begin soon. Imagine! Best of luck, Miss Fatafati. Thank you. Anupam da... Send her dress to the room. Sure, I'm sending it. You should get ready too, Biki madam. Cool down, madam. This is your finale outfit. Balaram da. Thank you. Anytime. You... Disgusting! May I say something? You’ve always taunted women of Phullora’s body type. But, is fashion just about the body? It’s the camaraderie of fashion and body type. What’s success got to do with body size, Bikiranbala? Bingo! Oil bottles, mannequins, awards, whatever be the product, can't we think beyond 36-24-36 women? Sure, you can. Mannequin, oil bottles, awards, none have a proper face, Bechu da. Just like her. Will they accept your face if you unmask yourself? Give me my 2nd change! Fatsoing away! Get started, you all. Girls up next, start walking! They will follow you. You know, the girls are walking in really high heels! They look lovely! Don’t worry. You’ll do great. I’ll go watch the show! Ma'am, we have to go. Hmm. Hmm. Oh Goddess! Heels! Heels? Yes. Essentials of a fashion show. Start packing the costumes of the previous round. It'll get messy after the show. 95. Damn fatso. You can’t do it... You see... Your body type... It’s difficult. Decorating an elephant with a string! I just hope now you know why fashion shows aren’t for fatsos. An amateur tailor from a small town. She is no model. What happened to her? You know how heavy your wife is! She will break the stage! Should’ve kicked you out years ago! This marriage is good for nothing! No beauty, nor talent! What's wrong? No idea! May be nervous. Will they accept your face if you unmask yourself? Wow! You can very well see the size of my body. And the size of my dreams? Well, that is 100-100-100!
