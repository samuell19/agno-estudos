If she is really good I'll take her to dinner Do you take her as a waitress? You beckon and she dashes over? She doesn't dare, right? Scared of the real stuff Whatever It's not whatever I hate con artists She's not a fraud She just tells fortunes Call her Come soon She can't She's out of town So she is a fraud OK, let's just say she's a fraud Why do you go on blind dates?

Let's have a drink I waited several hours for you I'd only been here an hour That's because you came the other way How many blind dates have you had? I don't remember How many times? Fifty or sixty? What about you? Just once with you You are too good for blind dates Am I good? Pretty good I was just dumped by my fiance We bought a house together and I lost her Do you know why? Why? She had another man I scolded her for stepping onto two boats She said she was the boat Me and the other guy were oars She picked the one that rowed better We were together for years and I was just an oar? I was furious so I hit her The way you hit me the other day It couldn't be the same You are much stronger You're right She fell down right away... and cried I said you should laugh Good thing you said I was an oar If you took me as a knife you'd be dead now Anyway It's the most despicable thing... for a man to hit a woman for her I must go now Why are you walking back? I don't want coffee Let's have tea then I don't want tea either What's wrong? What did I say that offended you? Don't smile at me Why did you come back to me? Because you hit me You deserve it I deserve it And I owe you money I have a date tonight A blind date? Let me go with you Stop kidding around I'm being serious I'll keep my distance I promise I won't disturb you Let me check the guy out for you How can that be? It won't do It's safer this way Having a male chaperon Have some water Thank you You are welcome It's a nice day Aren't you hot? I'm fine I'll untie a button You can do whatever you like Aren't you bored with studying everyday? It's OK Reserved women like you are rare these days A friend once said... the good thing about me is that I'm conservative The bad thing is I am too conservative Boyfriend, or girlfriend? Would I be here if I had a boyfriend? Of course it's a girlfriend Very pretty! She changes boyfriends faster than the weather That woman looks so uncouth smoking I disagree My girlfriend smokes as well... and she looks quite charming She says cigarettes made for women don't smell much Men don't feel repulsed when you kiss them after smoking What does your friend do? She's also a graduate student Wu Fang? I am Chen Mingliang I thought you looked familiar I looked at you from every angle I thought it might be you You are wearing glasses now You didn't use to wear them A friend of yours? The world is so small My high school classmate Classmates since kindergarten Then primary school and high school Have you forgotten? Are your teeth whiter than before? No wonder I couldn't recognize you at once 1 did it for you Didn't you see how untrustworthy... that guy was? Still angry? Weren't we classmates once? Who was your classmate? Let's end it here We'll go on our separate ways And not see each other till death You look so quiet and civil But you talk so viciously Why are you in such a rush to marry yourself off? Why do you hurry? For marriage I want to So old fashioned What do you mean? I am just like what my friend says Fang, the good thing about you is that you are conservative And the bad thing is you are too conservative Your friend is funny What does she do? Are you interested in her? I just think what she says is funny I don't think so - She is quite cynical - Really? Her mother whose experience affected her greatly raised her alone You'll never guess what her mother did for a living What did she do? Anyway some people look tough in appearance But it's a sign of weakness What did her mother do? Nothing Don't stop half way She was a makeup artist Isn't that nice? Not for the living But for the dead Sounds interesting She lied to her husband when they married She said she was a nurse Many years later After their baby was born her husband learned the truth Their story was quite bizarre Stranger than film and fiction Even the best writer can't dream it up I must go now Why? It's just getting interesting Don't leave me hanging Why don't you pick up the bill We'll be even Shall we meet tomorrow? What for? Can't we just have a chat? Pure chitchat I'm busy tomorrow I really must go Can't you let me go? All right! Are you serious? When have I lied to you? Excuse me Why isn't Lang playing tonight? I'm sorry sir She plays between 8 and 10 every night Thank you Not at all What do you think? Shall we try? Couldn't find you all night And here you are I did something amazing tonight I've never done it before Really exciting stuff I saw an amazing girl Are you listening? I heard you. A girl Really amazing What's the matter? A girl. Go on What's the matter? I'll take you out for some fun That friend of yours What happened after her father learned... that her mother was a beautician for the dead? Is that what you meant by having something very important... to talk about with me? Yes Can't you be serious? How am I not serious? Is this important? Of course I couldn't eat or sleep for a few days But think about your story all the time Isn't that important? I know you're depressed about losing your fiance But I don't have time to amuse you everyday I think you've got lots of time You go on so many blind dates You must have plenty of time I didn't mean to provoke you I meant, instead of going on blind dates with strange men Why don't you chat with me and tell me stories What do you think? Let's have dinner together tonight I have a class tonight Since you are here can't you look happier? Smile to me When I was in junior high I saw her father a few times His face was of a strange color Have you ever seen the stalk of a bok choy? Yes White with a green tint translucent almost He had long and messy hair... and an eccentric voice Once I was at their house at lunchtime her mom put a plate of food on the table Her dad tapped the plate hard with a chopstick Asking her if she had put poison in it I was shocked Why would she poison the food? Her mom looked down in silence Her dad said don't show me that dead face Marrying you was the worst blow fate had dealt me You not only smell like the dead you look dead as well Her mom whispered that she didn't poison the food Her dad swept all the dishes onto the floor Laughing one moment and crying the next Saying, please put some poison in it! Kill me with poison! I was so scared I had never seen anyone like this On our way to school my friend told me that her dad was demented Her mom was very pretty and very gentle With beautiful hands I heard about her profession after I had gone to college I didn't think it mattered You're in a different position from her dad Some issues are more sensitive between husband and wife Don't look at me that way I despise this kind of man Incompetent and violent to women He not only beat his wife but his own child when he was drunk Sometimes her sleeves couldn't cover the bruises You are really skinny But your skin is fine Why cover yourself up? Being shy? You're at it again I haven't seen a shy woman for a long while I have to go Shall we meet here again tomorrow? Don't push your luck If you don't come I'll go to your school everyday And wait for you at the gate And go into your classroom Why do you go on blind dates? I want to get married Why do you want to get married? Because like me, you are lonely Which is perfect I can drink tea with you and talk with you Why are you avoiding me? The first time I saw you I knew you were a scoundrel Actually I'm quite nice Eventually you'd know what an asshole I am To tell you the truth I think I am the man you are looking for As a matter of fact I am as good as ten men Instead of seeing ten other men you are better off chatting with just me You really know how to flatter yourself Is that self-flattering? I just want you to know me better I know you already Then let me know you better See you tomorrow I have classes tomorrow I really must go The day after tomorrow then OK See you then You can take her away if you like her Impossible I don't believe it Nor did I in the beginning I wouldn't have believed it If you told me so But it's true What's that guy doing? You waited too long You have to be decisive and act fast You missed your chance today Is it that simple? In junior high she was nicknamed Wrinkly Our literature teacher once joked... that her face was too wrinkled for her age That's how she got her nickname So it meant her face I thought it meant something else What happened later? Later, her dad got worse Beating her mom everyday Saying he couldn't stand her hands And asked her to wear gloves at all times Even in her sleep There was a long plastic rope... on a wall in their house On it hanged a few dozen pairs of gloves Later on her dad became dissatisfied with gloves He said they still emitted the smell of the dead He said as soon as he smelled it he'd want to die Just let him die Are you God? People die at your command? What could they do? Why didn't they get a divorce? Her mom did ask for a divorce But her dad didn't agree He said her mom's hands had ruined his life He'd divorce her if she'd cut off her hands Have you made this story up? I seem to have seen it in some movie What did I say that gave me away? Nothing Thank you I don't think you lied to me Why? My ex-girlfriend was the kind of people... who couldn't open their mouths without lying You don't seem to be that type Don't miss your chance tonight Rush over as soon as she sits at the piano Here she is Did you hear me? Actually I'm not that anxious Are you a man or not? Just you wait Fang? What did you say to her? She is Fang You must be mistaken She is that graduate student Impossible All the men here want her Why does she need to go on blind dates? After this piece... you can leave with her I told her I'd wait for her at the door I didn't know you played the piano so well Do you drink green tea? I want to lose weight Besides tea is especially thirst-quenching You are thin enough Am I? Fang? You are Fang. Stop pretending Want a cigarette? No thanks I'll have one Ok I'll smoke one Why don't you admit you are Fang? Who is Fang? You Do you have a girlfriend? Not now How many have you had before? Three Only three? How did you break up with them? The one in senior high... didn't work out because we went to different universities The one in my freshman year... broke up after a fight The last one broke up last month For what reason? I already told you once About being an oar You're funny Let me tell you I've seen hundreds of men Whatever your motives don't play games with me Who is playing games? Not me You look just like her You even sound like her Who? Fang and I? You speak the same way You are Fang Don't be so juvenile Fang and Lang. They even sound similar What a cliche way to pick up a girl Have you no other name... than Lang? Do you plan to come over to my place... and verify who I am? At least 7 or 8 men have had the same idea before you Your hand is so big. It can wrap mine Like a glove? That's right Have you heard the story of gloves? No No? A friend of mine told me a story... about a girl whose mother was a beautician for the dead Her husband initially didn't know When he learned about it later he developed psychological problems And asked her to wear gloves all the time You've never heard this story? Is it a true story? How could it be possible? Which of the three girlfriends was this girl? None. What are you thinking about? If you don't want to tell me I'll stop asking Why are you doing this? What? Doing this with men? Doing what with men? Drinking and chatting What's so bad about drinking and chatting with men? I didn't mean that What did you mean? You know what I meant It's just like playing the piano It's my job A relaxing way of making money What's wrong with it? It wouldn't be so relaxing if you meet a bad guy What is a bad guy? Aren't these people on the street bad guys? There aren't any bad guys in this world Only businessmen You work at night What do you do during the day? You work during the day What do you do at night? Sleep of course You are so cute I'm off Shall I escort you a while longer? That's not necessary Why aren't you eating? Eat some more Do you intellectuals only care about spiritual stuff and not material? That depends Why are you looking at me like that? Have some food Women I used to know all loved money I think that's fine I feel secure when women love money I knew you were a smart woman when I first saw you Don't you like smart women? See, you are smart There is nothing wrong with that But it's difficult to set standards Do you understand? Eat something. Why aren't you eating? We can be friends Come to me if you need help I'll do what I can If you have financial problems... You are too kind How nice it is for men to have money I have a friend. She's very pretty She says men can't be too poor A poor man is a bitter man The poorer, the bitterer And difficult to be with She only befriends rich men Filthy rich men... who drive Mercedes and BMW And talks of tens of millions of dollars Much richer than you But like you, they have standards All successful men have standards I don't love money that much It's like having clothes A piece more feels the same as a piece less My friend is different She turns men's heads... even in a pair of 20 dollar jeans She is so beautiful I'm the other way around Nobody would look at me Even if I were wearing something worth 20,000 Hi Am I late? No. I'm early I made green tea for you Thanks What's with you lately? Obsessed with this place Don't you like it here? Other cafes are always too dim... with sofas that feel like beds Even a nice guy like me would have unorthodox thoughts after a while Let alone you You are quite pretty Are you trying to comfort me? No. You are the type... that looks ordinary initially But becomes prettier with time Why can't you be serious? How can others trust you? They admire my morality Have some wine What are you doing? Give them back to me! I want to see what you look like without your glasses Give them back to me Just one look Give them to me! I just want to have one look Give them to me! I think you are prettier without glasses I am really, really sorry I didn't mean badly I was just kidding around Although we aren't exactly childhood sweethearts we are still friends in away, aren't we? We've had a few cups of tea together... and a few cups of coffee You can tell I'm a nice guy I am honest and kind-hearted Anyway I am sorry If you like as long as it can ease off your anger you can do whatever you want to As long as you can stop being angry just do whatever suits you Can you really keep a promise? Yes Ok, our friendship ends here You walk on your wide road... and I'll cross my single-plank bridge As if we'd never met Ok, on one condition What? You take the wide road... and let me cross the single-plank bridge I can't let a bespectacled female graduate student take the single-plank bridge I'll take it Why are you such a butthead? Yes, I can be quite shameless Sometimes you're too much to handle That depends on whom you compare me with With that father of your mysterious friend as the bottom line there are no unbearable men in this world Why compare yourself to him? He's been dead more than 10 years How did he die? Murdered By whom? Who exorcized this devil for the world? You have no compassion I have compassion. It depends for whom Tell me what happened exactly? There is no answer It stirred up such a sensation Wife killing husband Everybody talked about it This type of story always gets distorted Some said her mom stabbed her dad 30 times with a sharp knife Some said she chopped him with an axe Some even claimed that her mom slit her dad's throat in his sleep spilling blood all over the wall Actually when it happened my friend was there And saw the whole thing She said she had a premonition that morning She was really scared After her father died she became famous in her school People gossiped about her behind her back A long time later when talking about it she said she killed her father How old was she? Fourteen or fifteen Why? Nothing She didn't have to die for murder She was under the legal age Before she told me about it her mother was sent to jail for unintentional manslaughter Why? Her mother admitted in court that she had killed him Was there any evidence? Does confession count as evidence? Her father was killed in the kitchen Her mom was cooking in the kitchen Her dad was drunk... and attempted to rape her mom Her mom resisted Her dad became angry He knocked her mom's head on the wok You know that kind of thick cast-iron wok He knocked so hard that her head broke Blood ran all over her face My friend was frightened She went over in tears and pulled her dad's legs But she was too weak for him He kicked her in the heart She fell down and couldn't move Her mom was enraged She picked up the wok and threw it at her dad knocking him over It wasn't fatal But when her dad fell he bumped onto a potato peeler It slit an artery on his neck That's how her dad died What? I'm telling you a story You've taken it seriously? What happened later? I told you it's a story What later? All stories have an ending Her mom was sentenced to 20 years... for unintentional manslaughter Eat together? The story is finished. Stop following me Have dinner with me? I have a class tonight You are lying Learned how to identify truth from fake from your girlfriend? Let me follow you to your school If you really have classes I promise I won't harass you again Can't you stop being such a butthead? I swear I am serious Ok. I'll tell you I don't have classes tonight I guessed as much But I do have a date A blind one? Can you not go? I'm almost late I really must go. Bye bye Wait What do you think of me? What do you mean? How about me? Would you like to be my girlfriend? Can't you be serious? I am serious You are never serious Right now I am I'll seriously answer you: no Why not? What about you? Why do you want me as your girlfriend? I can't articulate it But I know it in my heart How should I put it? Like, the way you talk Especially when you are angry What kind of reason is that? Yes I often go on blind dates I enjoy doing it I know I'm ugly and men don't like me But I'd rather be rejected by other men... than accepting your offer What do you take me for? An aid recipient? I don't regard you as an aid recipient I don't want to talk to you Don't follow me Why don't you want to talk to me? What the hell! What? Are you nuts? I want to talk to you My girlfriend is here Come back tomorrow Let me put down the beer. It's heavy Come tomorrow I'll sit here I promise I won't look that way I need to talk to you Otherwise I'm too depressed Are you crazy? Get out! Or I'll call the police Go ahead and call the police I'll talk to them... and stop bothering you You didn't drink Why are you acting drunk? Why don't you go downstairs? I'll follow you down later What's wrong with saying a few words? I won't look your way You can do whatever you like Just regard me as a blind man What's wrong? Bad mood? I seem to understand women less and less Girlfriend of many years... became someone else's wife Just when we were about to marry There used to be many bitter women before Now there are more and more bitter men I'm not bitter but full of hatred I don't hate her I hate myself She had an affair right in front of me And I didn't detect it at all Ain't I the stupidest idiot in the world? You are not stupid You just trusted her too much All my friends including myself think I am a complete idiot People think I am a hooker We don't live our lives for others In reality, I'm playing the role of a psychotherapist You are the prettiest therapist in the world I thought you were nice But you are quite slick-tongued I'm telling the truth Did I tell you that my ex-girlfriend was a pianist? Really? We went to the same university She was studying music She played the piano at bars in her spare time She made a lot of money We bought a house together Had it all done up We even had our wedding photos taken And she married someone else Maybe you two weren't meant for each other That's for sure Maybe when we leave this bar later you'll meet the girl of your dreams at the door You say I'm slick-tongued I think you are I'm not being slick-tongued I'm just being professional You pay for me to talk to you And I must make you feel good You are so nice Why don't you take me home? Now the truth comes out I didn't mean that I don't want to do anything to you I just don't like going home It makes me depressed Reminding me of many unhappy events The way you describe your girlfriend... makes me jealous Is she pretty? Not as pretty as you Her name is Fang? No Fang is someone else Your new girlfriend? She is not my girlfriend She is just a friend What are you complaining about... now that you've got a new girlfriend? I've said she is not my girlfriend She rejected me She is avoiding me now Her mobile is always off No wonder Sorry, the subscriber you have dialed is powered off Sorry, the subscriber you have dialed is powered off Sorry, the subscriber you have dialed is powered off I want to talk to you about something Will you swap houses with me? Are you nuts? No way! You don't want to exchange your dump for my 3-bedroom apartment? I hate going home Do you understand? I'll keep harassing you So what some bitch dumped you? Must you hang yourself on that tree? None of the trees will let me hang myself on them Do you want the pianist or the graduate student? I'm not giving you a hard time Listen to me Stop fancying Lang She's the forest type... who appears to be full of roads But after going around a while you find yourself in the same spot Apart from delusions and traps there are no roads at all How do you know? Don't forget I went around the forest before you Is there another type of women... who appears to have no roads But is in fact full of them? Yes They are called the Rome type All roads lead to Rome Try to concentrate on that graduate student An ugly wife is priceless... as the old saying goes She's not ugly She becomes prettier with time Then what are you doing here? You asked me over Don't come to me any more Why not? It's not necessary If you are lonely find yourself a nice girlfriend Who said I'm lonely? I have a girlfriend Really? It's that graduate student I told you about The story I told you... happened to her friend's parents She tells fortune with tealeaves She is full of surprises Do you think I like her? Judging by the way you act I can tell you like her a lot I don't deny it You two are different How so? She is the type... that makes one feel close to You are the type that... Knocks one over Yes you knock men over Do you think you are like a pill? Or a.. Baseball bat Do you have a boyfriend? Several hundred I mean... Don't be silly No boyfriend? Oh well... Dream on! Then you do have a boyfriend Let's just say I do Actually my dad was also a loser He wrote a play when he was young During the Cultural Revolution And became famous overnight A young and amorous talent He had a lot of fans Although not as crazy as today's fans My mom was very pretty Dad picked her amongst several hundred girls All his life he only wrote that one script And was glamorous for only a few months Marrying him didn't bring my mother... any happiness But lots of pain She says to me... she's a walnut Before marrying she was juicy... and lovely Marriage turned her into a tough nut Dark and jabbing Later, when the shell was cracked and the kernel exposed her life became better You are the walnut kernel That's right What does your mom do? She runs a glove factory Glove factory? Gloves again! Hello? It's you! This is Chen. This is Chen I know I can tell I was really worried these days Where have you been? Why is your phone always off?

All right I'll call you tomorrow Ok? See you tomorrow Ok. Goodbye Can you help me analyze myself? Why do I always think of you? Stop it What? Stop making fun of me How am I making fun of you? Do you know what's missing in you? What? Femininity A really feminine woman... would have been flattered by what I said But you are so stiff Stiff? You think I'm a corpse? Would I regard you as a corpse? You've studied too much... without thorough comprehension Where you should be sensitive you're not; and where you shouldn't be you're too sensitive What's it to you? I care about you I'm worried you might be conned I went on a date during the conference in Hangzhou... with a postdoc, a critic Fie! What? A blind date in Hangzhou? What's wrong? Can you stop embarrassing yourself? You go on one blind date after another And get despised over and over If it doesn't hurt your self-respect it hurts mine Can't you change your strategy? Don't you know... There is a rainbow in front of you And you needn't run through thunderstorms You really like me? It sounds corny But when you were away I really missed you Other men despise me why not you? I'm not other men I can see what others can't see Stop going on blind dates It's so chaotic out there What if you meet some bad guys? You're not as tough as other women You look like a bad guy How do you know I'm not tough? Judging by what you just said Don't you know... tough women don't talk like you The tougher they are the softer they speak I didn't know you were so experienced in this respect It's not experience It's perception How is your friend's mom doing in prison? She was released two years ago Oh yeah? But she went back in after a while Why? I'm not quite sure Where did she go back? Back in jail? I think so Why? Because she likes it so much? She couldn't get used to the outside world Will you let me meet your friend? I won't Why not? I'm afraid you'll fall in love with her Can you not turn your mobile off?

When I see a beauty Every man becomes eloquent in the presence of a beauty What beauty? She's just ordinary Only number 3 in the country You are so ungrateful You are quite talkative tonight So are you Oh so I'm wrong I'm sorry my darling You can tell fortune with tealeaves right? Would you like to show them how? Who says I can tell fortune? I can only tell something about love That's great! How do you do it? How do you do it? Don't mess up your tealeaves By just looking at the leaves in your teacup she can tell your fate I'm first. Lady first Gosh you're anxious You really want to know? Yes Are you paying? Anything You are a smart woman Quite manipulative True You know how to play cards with men And have them do what you want them to do But you are too anxious and impatient You can conquer men quickly But in turn show your flaws too soon In fact, you look tough but are actually quite weak You trick men into loving you But eventually they'd come to resent you Normal men don't like you They'd try to get rid of you quickly In general, it should be said... that you can make men fall in love with you at first sight That's true But you can't keep a long-term relationship It's hard for you to obtain everlasting love Sounds like I should marry myself off soon Yes, yes It's useless It won't change your fate What is fate? These dumb tealeaves? Sometimes, fate is just a few tealeaves Why did you pinch me? I didn't Didn't you ask me to do this? Right I was just kidding Don't take it seriously I won't That's great Let me toast to everyone It was just a joke But she is good Chen, have another one Stop drinking Come, bottoms up I've hit my limit Yes or no?

I know you like Chen's girlfriend! I'll help you I'll get Chen drunk so you'll get a chance Jun! I hate it when a man hits a woman Why did you hit my boyfriend? I'll kill you! Hi May we have a room? What type of room? Can you help me analyze myself? Why do I always think of you? Stop it! What? Stop making fun of me How am I making fun of you? Do you know what's missing in you? What? Femininity A really feminine woman... would have been flattered by what I said But when you were away I really missed you Other men despise me why not you? I'm not other men You've studied too much... without thorough comprehension Where you should be sensitive you're not; and where you shouldn't be you're too sensitive I didn't know you were so experienced in this respect You go on one blind date after another And get despised over and over If it doesn't hurt your self-respect it hurts mine! Can't you change your strategy? Don't you know... there is a rainbow in front of you And you needn't run through thunderstorms You really like me?
