Then she swirled around and dived back down to the depths. Just a ripple. He's gonna shoot. He shoots! He scores. Yes! Get in! I'm off to call her Nessie. What if she pulls me in and drags me round t'pond? You'll have to give me the kiss of life, Trev. Malcolm! - What you got? - Maggots. I'll get a mixing bowl. Take these in for us, Malc. - Cassie. Just give us... - I don't talk to poofs. They're still wriggling. What's she say that for? - What did you want her for? - Private. - I thought she'd finished with you. - Get lost! I did get lost once. In the Arndale. My mam was looking for me everywhere. We passed each other on the escalator. Why do we have to wait till tonight to catch this fish with your Trev? I've told you. It's too hot. They don't feed much during the t'day. That's a leg. You should have stuck her down on a bit of card. Corn flakes box or summat. Yeah, but I like fitting all the bits together. Save the best bits till last. - You off fishing? - Come with us if you want. I'm off up the arcade. Golden Nugget. There's a couple of new games. They're dead good. I went last night. - Has stopped stinging, then? - Yeah. What did you do? Maurice Edlington threw us in some nettles. I only had me shorts on cos it were hot. How could you put a fish on a tape? You couldn't, could you? Unless it was a dolphin. - Hey, Pogo. - What? I'm fishing. Whoa! Whoa! That's a bloody peacock, innit? - Who's this? - Trev's band. Him and Vic and Maurice Edlington. Innit, Trev? Your band. They were ace. They used to practise in t'shed and leave door open, so we could hear, and we'd all be doing head banging in the back, like... Hi, Cassie. - I'm thinking of having me hair cut. - I'll do it for you. I might go into town. Number one round here. - Have it red on top. - It'll look nice. My mam says it'll look like a carbuncle. - A what? - A boil. What did you say? I told her she looks like a walnut in a wig. - Give us a fag. - Sod off! - Is your Mam old? - No. Just looks it. We used to have a majorette's uniform at our house. My mam said it's what I used to wear, but it isn't. You know you said one of them songs you did was about a bird you once went out with? Yeah. - And she chucked you, right? - Right. So, how long did it take you to get over it? A broken heart never mends, Malc. Oh, shit. Can't you stop your Cassie going out with Maurice Edlington? - For you? - For hersen. He's turning her against everybody and that. Don't you reckon? It's not for me to tell her, is it? She's not my proper sister. - Do you hate him? - Course I don't. His brother were your best mate, wasn't he? They used to be a couple of good kids, Vic and Maurice, before everything. Yeah. You can't make somebody like you, Malc. No, I know that. I can't stop thinking about her, though. Well, there's nowt you can do about it. I sometimes try to astral-project myself into her bedroom. - Eh? - I don't mean to do owt. I mean, just to put my thoughts into her head. It's sending me mad. When I play them arcade games, I sometimes wish I could get inside and never come out again, like in that film. You won't say owt to her, will you? I mean, you can tell her what an ace kid I am and that. - No. I won't say owt. - Pogo? If I was a majorette, why haven't I got a bugle? I think I'll get off. OK. See you. I've got a sailor's cap, but that doesn't mean I was in the navy. And a Davy Crockett hat. - Do me a summer special now. - If you like. Can I have a love song, so I can remember Malcolm in love in my summer? Yeah, I'll give it a go. I'm off for my dinner now, Trev. Bye.

My Auntie Betty in Hexthorpe works in Pennywise and she says there might be a job coming up. You know, just in the warehouse, moving boxes. I think I'm sorted for somewhere to stay for now. I've a mate, got a flat near the hospital. Says I can stop with him. It's all right. It'll do till I find somewhere. Course, I won't be able to take my tackle with me, so I'll leave you in charge.

I would, but with me dad gone, and me brother... ..I'm stuck. What about me? D'you hear about them two kids in Rossington? Parents didn't want 'em going out together and her dad got a job somewhere else, so they were gonna be moving away. - Do you know what they did? - What? They stood between the rails, hand in hand, in front of the London train. I could do that. Maurice, don't say that! Oh, I could. Maybe I could do it for you. Really? No. - You don't spell it like that, do you? - What? - Cassie. - Yeah. - I've spelt it with a K. - Where? - I've tattooed it on my leg! - You lie. - No, no, no. I have. - You daft git!

Is me mam doing us some sandwiches and a flask? - She might do you. - I'm borrowing a proper rod. - Me mam's getting it this afternoon. - Well, what sort? - A fishing rod. - Yeah, I know, but what type? Is it a float rod, carp rod, pike rod, ledger rod? Me uncle got it at Bridlington. - A sea-fishing rod? - Yeah. You can't... Oh, it'll do. - How long are we staying out for? - Will we need to take sleeping bags? It gets cold at night. I'm taking a pair of my mam's old tights. You poof. They keep your legs warm, don't they, Trev? You wear women's tights? Sometimes. What's it like? Look, you two can be putting the rods and the bank sticks in my bag. It's all out there. You all right now? I think I need to use the toilet. Come on. I'll take you home. I bet it's dead spooky down there at night, don't you? Yeah. We might see a ghost. Whooo! Very funny. - Hey, you're fishing, right? - Right. There's this ghost behind you with his head tucked under his arm. - And you swing back to cast out. - Yeah. And you hook his head. Then it goes... ptoooooh - into the middle of the pond. - Then it goes... - That would be funny. - Wouldn't it? There's a notepad in t'cupboard. I'm not writing. You are. There's nowt to put.

You don't think I'm being...? Go. Yeah. Cassie. Cassie, it's me, Malcolm. I'm sending my brain waves out to you. They're in the street. They're coming in through your letterbox. up your stairs, under your bedroom door. I'm in your room. I'm sat next to you. Don't be scared. It's just a close encounter. Can you feel my love reaching out? I love you. I've got one of your hair slides. I nicked it from your kitchen the other day. Can you feel me kissing you? Oh, Cassie, please be me girlfriend. Look, Maurice Edlington don't love you, not the way I do. Malcolm! Hang on. Me mam's shouting me. What are you doing? Never been cleaned since you've had it, by the looks of it. - How many are you feeding? - Me and David. Well, go easy with the butter. That's all there is. Cassie! Cassie! Go and tell her to turn it down, will you? Cassie! Cassie! Sorry. Your mam says turn it down. Down's not off. Thanks. - Where are you off? - Why? - Are you off out with Maurice? - What if I am? - I'm trying to... - I can look after myself, thank you. I'm not a little kid. I'm not half-baked like that Pogo. Just be careful around him. Maurice is a laugh. He's not boring like you and everybody else around here. I don't need you trying to tell me how to run my life. Look at your own. What do you do, eh? What do you do? Pathetic. Just leave my stuff alone, will you? Get out! Go on. Get out. This is my room! - It used to be mine. - Yeah, well... It doesn't mean you can just waltz in whenever you like. Get out, go on! Go and play with your floats! His brother Vic is away because of a girl. - What? - His brother is in prison. What did he do? He took her in t'woods. She thought they were just going for a walk. It finished their family. Kids at school would shout things about Vic and Maurice'd go berserk. I mean, like, really crazy. He's eaten up with it, Cassie.

Couple of announcements before the bingo. Correction to picture quiz last night. Question number ten. Aye. Yeah. I can only go on what's written in front of me. Come on! After consideration, I have to concede that photo was Tony Blair and not, as was on my answer sheet, Bobby Darin. So any as put Tony Blair and were on 23 points, I think that were Archie's table, we'll sort out a meat board for you. We can't give you the meat board what won as t'sausages have been had, so I'm told. Yeah! Right, so it's Tony Blair for number ten. Fat chance of that. Right. Er, moving on. Go on! Just clear off. Chuck some ground bait in for us, Dave. Belt out a few free offerings, little balls of ground bait. - Is nobody coming with us? - In a bit. Let me catch summat first. - Where, Trev? - Four swims in line with each rod. - About there? - A bit further. - Can I start now? - No, not yet. Come on, Nessie. Come and pick up all them tasty morsels. Quiet! I spy with my little eye... Something beginning with T. - Torch. - Tackle box. - You're not playing. - Trumpet. Settle down. Sorry, Trev. I'm getting excited. I thought you were my mate. I shouldn't have to tell you this. There's already a notice gone up. But I guess some of you can't read. It's been brought to the attention of the committee that the area behind the fire doors is being used by certain individuals as a urinal. Any person found doing so will be suspended from club membership forthwith indefinitely. You have been warned. Right, eyes down. Shh! Shut up. - What? - I heard summat. Listen. It's a ghost! - Don't. - Huh! I can't see where it's going. It's got no head. Shut up. - Hiya! - Bloody hell! - What? - Quiet! - How you doing? - I'm doing all right. - How many you got? - Eh? - Fish. - I've only just started. I'm going back on me own, then. Chuffin' hell! Will you shut up? Hang on, then. Look after me rod for us, Malc. Don't catch owt, though. Leave it for when I come back, right? Yeah, sure. It's great, innit? Stars coming out and that. Everything still. It's like a different place at night. - Same as school. - Eh? That's different at night. Hmm. No, I mean... this bit. It's sort of special. Like one of them cathedrals where you have to talk quiet. - What's that? - It's Dave turning into a werewolf. That star reflected down there. It's like fishing in the universe. - Oh, Christ! - Don't stop. The bit where his hand starts to ripple and the hair starts to grow. Yeah, and his jaw came right out. It were ace, weren't it? What's up? You just poked your finger in my eye! Oh, soz. I can't see. Right in me fucking eyeball! Soz. Soz, Dave. That bloody hurt! I said I'm sorry. You fucking dickhead. Well, it hurt me when you bit me in the neck before. What am I suppose tell me mam? Dave Buckfield give me a love bite? Oi! I'm gonna kill you! Get off! Get off, you! I hate you! Get... Get off! - What's that? - What? - That lump on your leg? - Nowt! - What you got on? - Eh? - Let's have a look. - Get off! You've got stockings on! I haven't! Yeah, you have. What's that, a suspender belt? No! - Yes, it is! You've got stockings on! - Get off! I'm off home. Didn't your mam have any tights? She'd only lend me these. She thinks I'm using 'em to net tiddlers. Don't tell. Don't tell anyone, Dave. What do they feel like? They feel all right. What, sexy? Yeah, a bit. What if you'd have got knocked over on t'way round our house? I know. I were thinking that. Last time I come here at night, I chucked some magazines in. What? Some mucky magazines. My mam found 'em in my bedroom. She wouldn't let me put 'em in dustbin in case the dustbin man found 'em. So I got a sack out of the coal shed, put 'em in that, came down here and... Pffff! Trev? Hmm? You know when you get older... ..do you, like, understand things better? No. What happens, then? You just have more things you don't understand. Is that why you come fishing? - I don't wanna get older. - Who does? Me! I do. You can give me your years if you don't want 'em. My mam says she still feels 16 in her head. But she can't do. I mean, she never has a laugh or owt. Do you still feel 16? - No. - No. Y-You sort of act like someone in their 20s. - I am. - Yeah. This is weird, innit? ♪ Twinkle, twinkle, little star ♪ How I wonder what you are ♪ Up above the world so high ♪ Like a diamond in the sky ♪ Twinkle, twinkle, little star ♪ How I wonder what you are We've come for a reel. He forgot it. It's in here somewhere. - Look for it, then. - It doesn't matter. Come on, quick! We didn't know there was anybody in here. Well, there is. Found it. I know you, don't I? - No. - What's up? - I know him. - So? Don't I? - No. - What's going on? Come on, Maurice. Let him out. Never forget a face. Yesterday, do you remember where it was? He were down at the ponds yesterday watching a bloke fishing. You weren't watching something else? Leave him, Maurice. Let him go now. Don't frighten him. You're a good runner, aren't you? No. You're a little jack rabbit! Tell him, Cassie. He's my mate. Tell him to pack it in. Maurice. This little jack rabbit was watching us yesterday. - Was it you? - I didn't see anything. - There was nothing to see! - I know. You enjoy it, watching in the woods? - No. - Just a hobby? Like trainspotting? Leave him, Maurice, please. He's my mate. He didn't mean anything. He won't do it again. Will you? Did we get a five-star rating? He doesn't understand what you're on about. Leave it now. Come on. - Do you like girls? - Do something! - They're all right. - Do you know what you are, eh? - Eh? - Yes. - What? - I'm going. Let me out! What? A pervert. He doesn't mean anything. He's just a kid. - Don't take it out on him. - Don't take what out on him? We let him get away with it, then? We let the dirty little bastard go? Go on! Sod off! Don't take what out on him? What's Trevor been telling you, then? - Come on. - I'm off home. Oh, come on. Come on, Shane. I'm off in. What am I doing, then? I'll see ya. Hey... So what did he tell you, then? He was on about what your brother did. He told me who the girl was. It was Pogo, wasn't it? Why do moths fly into the light? Maybe he's afraid of the dark. So why don't they just fly about in daytime? I still sleep with my curtains open. Me mam says God put stars in the sky to keep us from being afraid of the dark. I used to be. Did you, Trev? I can't remember. You grow out of all that. Trev, can I reel it in to see if my bait's still on? It might have come off. Can I check it? If you want, yeah. Oh, no. - What? - Oh, no, I knew this would happen. It's doing it! Oh, fuck! There's a fish on it. - What do I do? - Strike! Strike! Oh! There's summat on! Oh, it's caught mine! Strike, you fool! Oh, bloody bananas! I've got summat here. Keep your rod up! - What is it, a carp or a pike? - Carp, I think. Feels like an octopus on heat! Oh, it's coming in like a wet sack, Trev! - So's mine. - Oh! - What is it? - Is it Nessie? What we got? You've caught each other and half a ton of weed. Is that all? I had a fish, didn't I? Pogo's line must have caught yours when she reeled in. No fish. I nearly had a bloody heart attack cos of you! Look after me rod, Pogo, while I untangle this lot. You shouldn't have been fishing so close. - I didn't cast it! - Hey, pack it in, you two. Knobhead. Do you want some help? Yeah. Grab hold of that end. You'll have to cut the line. I thought we'd found your porn collection, Malc. If that's what you want. Do what you want. I don't care. Cassie. Turn around. Turn around. What's this, eh? A dead donkey? This is Nessie, this is! - Whoa! Hold on! - I can do it. Let me do it. She's moving. She's going down. I can feel her getting deeper. - Come on. - Slowing down. She's stopped. I can't shift her. She's massive. Hmm. Yellow submarine. Don't try to reel in. You'll snap off. Just hold. Just wait. When she goes, just let her go. There's some reeds down this side. Make sure she doesn't get in them. If she goes towards the reeds, just pull her away. Keep it tight. Pull sideways. And she'll come around. She's going! She's going! We're off! - Just let me... - No! Me! Let me! Let me tighten the reel. She's taking too much line. It must be the Loch Ness Monster! Yippee! There she blows! Watch what you're doing! Watch it! Come on, girl. Come on, Nessie. Start to reel in. Keep it tight. You're doing great. If the hook's well in her lip, she's yours. - Can the hook come out? - A big 'un can bend the hook. - A fish? - Yeah, sometimes the line just snaps. - What, and the hook stays in? - Shut up, will you? Shut it! Keep it tight. Don't force it. Oh, Trev, she feels fantastic! I can feel her muscles trembling through the line. - Come on, Nessie. - Come on, Nessie. Come on, girl. Can you see? Shit! She's had enough. She's tiring. Get the net. Pass us the landing net, Malc. The landing net, not the bloody keep net! - It's better than arcade games, this. - Don't let me lose her. Not now. Please. I promise I'll be good. Just let me hold her. Just let me see her. I won't hurt you, Nessie. I promise. - Come on, Nessie. That's it. - There she is! - Come on. Come on. - Go on, Trev. Come on, Nessie. She's huge! I've got her. Look at this! Look at this! - Oh, man! - That's amazing! It must weigh 15, maybe 18 pounds. - Have I hurt her? - No, I'm taking the hook out now. Don't make it hurt her, Trev. It won't. There's no barb on these hooks. There. Done. Does this make it your best summer? She's lovely. It's the biggest fish ever caught here, and you caught it. She doesn't like it out here, Trev. She wants to go back in the water. Let's put her back now. Just let me try and weigh her first. - I've got some scales somewhere. - No, no. We know it's Nessie. We don't need that. Please put her back, Trev. It's your catch. Her little eye is telling me she wants to go. She wants to go back in the water, Trev. Come on. We'll let you go.

You know, just in the warehouse, moving boxes. I caught a fish last night. Did he tell you? He's got another think coming if he thinks I'm gonna miss him. I don't need a bodyguard, you know.

Because he loves you. Does he? Yes. I'll remember Trevor loves me. And I love my mam and she loves me. And I love Jesus and he loves me. They'll probably get mixed up so I think me mam is Jesus and Trevor is me mam. But I'll have the love, though, won't I? That'll still be there. I won't remember where it came from, but I can take it with me, can't I? I can take it with me when I go up to meet Jesus and give it back to him. It all came from him in the first place, didn't it? I don't know. We're learning about drugs in RE. Hello, Malcolm. What's up with her? Her and Maurice have finished. - Have they? - Last night. - Really? - Yes.
