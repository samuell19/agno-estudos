Good Evening. I am the Chorus This... what are you doing there? This is my naughty... - Your actress... - True, true, actress Dear, our public is waiting for us to start 'Utsav" What is it about? About the Festival of Spring About youth, flowers, love and colour And the love of Vasantsena, the courtesan A Courtesan! Ugh! Do not sneer We speak an era in which courtesans were honoured Not today's India then! No. It was an age when India was prosperous - India of the 64 arts! - What are they, sir? Music, for instance It was a national obsession They lived, died and even ruined themselves for music Like Charudatt, our hero, the love of Vasantsena... Rich once, he has nothing left Ah, the spell of art! Another art, equally obsessive, gambling! Watch that man A famous masseur once He does nothing but gamble Art! That! - No less than stealing - Stealing? That is Sajjal, the thief Unmatched in the art of stealing What is he doing? What else can a thief be doing at night? He can be doing "this" at night! There's another art for you. Love India celebrates the art of Love "Love" is painted, sung and glorified in music Vatsyayan is writing a book on the art of Love "Kamasutra" - Can I meet him? - Yes When? - When I dress up Oh, it's you! You were telling me about the arts, sir The art of politics An evil king rules the city People are unhappy Aryak, son of a shepherd, is planning a revolution And his companion? - He has no name True, politicians are always anonymous Samsthanak Brother-in-law of the king He is chasing Vasantsena Will no one help? - People are afraid. - Won't you help? I am the Chorus I start the show. I don't interfere Wait! Where has she gone? - Patience, sir. Guards! Where did she go? There! Samsthanak loves you. He will give you anything Stop playing a coquette! It is getting late Haven't you gone yet? Maitrey Are you going or not? - I refuse to go You know what the streets are like at night? Full of thieves, pimps... ...assassins, terrorists! And to take this maid with me? A poor Brahmin like me, how can I protect her? My wife needs the maid to help her with the child If you don't go, I shall You don't have to go Nor do I It is a job for a servant Four years ago, we had so many servants Today, not a single one left! Are you making up for my wife's absence? Go on. Avoid facing the truth You and your music Your flute, veena and drums Where are your music-Ioving friends now? Flown away like birds It is late. Madam will be waiting Your father-in-law retires early Who will open the door? Come This had to go out now Go on. I'll light it and come There she is. But, sir... Help! From Aryak, a present to the King You and your music! You and your music! So it's your turn now "The evening passes from the skies..." "...and leaves us with our Ioneliness" "Birds of rays fly... ...away from our eyes" "Young buds were peeping from a net of leaves" "Lost in the fragrant humming" "Suddenly the sleepy eyes are invaded by darkness" "The buds have no companion in their tears" "The night comes draped in a veil of glow-worms..." "...and whispers the fragrance of the night flowers" You are still here? Not gone yet? Maitrey refused to take you? He is becoming unsufferable Alright, I'll escort you My wife will be furious Bring me that shawl! Don't just stand there That yellow one Must be there somewhere Who are you? Pardon me for entering your house without permission I am Vasantsena I am Charudatt, and you are beautiful The King's brother-in-law was harrasing me I took shelter in your house A beautiful person like you... alone... in the night Usually, we have nothing to fear He seems to have gone. I'll go now Alone? I'll come with you May I? No, no. Wait. I'll get a lamp No oil. Even lamps don't burn for pennyless men Like us courtesans? - No, no. I didn't mean that Please don't worry. People respect us I'll go alone Oh... the theives... May I leave my jewellery here for the night? Here? Certainly Please... I am sorry to trouble you It's all right I meant my neXt piece of jewellery. It's complicated Where does one start? The first hook is here I said the road will be infested with rascals. You... Yes, the bananas Perhaps we should lie down? I wish be easier to take off I wish Vatsyayan was here He is in our house, writing a treatise on love The Kamasutra You know how many postures he has discovered? Twenty-eight - Twenty-eight! This is going to be the 29th Sir, you are a source of knowledge for us all Your visit is a great honour I am not an immodest man, but you are right What is your house after all? A house of pleasure... a brothel? In a hundred years, nobody will remember it Too true. It's all Maya My Kamasutra will make it immortal It will be remembered as... ...the creative workshop The laboratory where I researched By God's grace! This is why I insist these girls listen to you To learn your deep metaphysics Not only metaphysics, but science! To analyse the reactions between man and woman To classify and tabulate the data That is Science! Doesn't your research... ...affect you personally? A good question For the scientific spirit What's needed is detachment What's essential is... Objectivity! That's why I am a bachelor! Celebrate! Love for me is a matter of study What is a "posture" after all? Merely a state of mind! Sir Have you discovered any new postures? I am afraid not I am still stuck at 28 The 29th continues to elude me The younger generation worries me by it's lack of imagination Sir, upstairs Quick, sir, quick. These novices... so eXcitable! Quick! It takes only five minutes after all Beautiful! Take it down! The man shoves his head in the crook of woman's elbow She touches his navel with her nose and sneezes He bellows like a bull... ...and wraps his legs round a column(pillar) Presses his elbow into her back She cackles like a swan They fall to the floor with a thud... ...on his left hip and... ...stare into each other's eyes. We shall call this... THE COLUMN POSTURE (PILLAR) I have discovered a marvellous posture! I must tell Vasantsena. I have found the 29th! Slaves for sale Don't beat me Give me time to sell myself Why gamble if you had no money? A masseur for sale! I was the palace masseur He can't even sell himself Market is dull today Sell your father - He is dead - Sell your mother Haven't got one - Sell yourself I am trying Sir, will you buy me?

Let him go The money first Bravo! - Lower your voice You saved my life, I am your slave for life I swear You'll follow me? - Say the word You knew Aryak? - Who doesn't? Who doesn't?

Vasantsena's jewels What? The thief? How can I face Vasantsena now? You men are all the same Always slobbering after women But I only offered her shelter in our house And what else? She took off her jewels just after shelter Don't give me those eXcuses What a nice time for shelter! I go to Father's house and she gets shelter here! You are being unfair Yes, I'm stupid. Not clever like that woman Radha, are you ready? You are not leaving at this time of the night? I'll come with you Why, are you afraid I may change my mind? You wait for her here I'll take Maitrey with me Unless he too wants to see her No, no, I am coming Take this Please It is the last piece left from what Father gave me Give it to Vasantsena Ask her forgiveness Say no one is to blame Shy of soldiers, aren't you?

Today his servant Don't you have any work? Thank you Give my thanks to Charudatt for his concern The town is crawling with thieves and tricksters Can I go now? Wait I had promised Charudatt I would give a present to anyone who brings my jewels How is my present to you She was my maid, she will be your life-partner Don't tease me Silly girl, go, be happy How I envy you - Are you Sajjal? - Perhaps Follow me The King's dogs have just caught Aryak, our chief You are the best thief in the city No wall, no lock can stop you You know the prison well You must free Aryak, tonight! Sorry, friend Please, put it away! This is my beloved, we are about to get married See you in a fortnight! Are you looking for this? Yes, I am the best, but after a fortnight How sad! Had you agreed... ...you and your Guru would have become famous You'd be called a political magician, not a thief A committed artist Now the honour will go to somebody else - Sure? - History beckons you Let's go Have you no eyes, idiot? You men are all the same I am Maitrey, friend of Charudatt Another one from his house! Go inside! Don't you have any work? Please, continue You didn't know my friend well... He is a gambler... He has gambled away your jewellery So this necklace has been sent as compensation By his wife - His wife? - Yes It's the last piece left from her inheritance She gave this and left - Left? For where? - For her father's house So she won't be home tonight? No, knowing her temper... ...she won't be back for sometime Thank you Good evening, sir Gambler Listen, sir Tell him to wait for me tonight You will tell him, won't you? How will she come in such rain, I ask you! Maitrey, how long do we wait in the rain? Come Shall we go in too? But first, there is a problem What is the value of your wife's necklace? I don't know. Why? I have gambled it away Will this do in eXchange? It's the same... Will it do? This jewellery is difficult to take off, and this rain... Not tonight The other hooks are only for the thieves I'll tear her to pieces Throw her bones to the dogs She dare defy me? The brother-in-law of the King? I'll twist her neck - Your highness, careful. - Let me handle this Give it here You have hurt yourself. You're bleeding You don't realise how strong you are You are like a child Chasing a woman won't help to win her heart She drives me to it. She mocks me, needles me - What do I lack? - Listen to me I'll whip her If you listen to me, she will bare her back herself Send a covered chariot tomorrow Wait for her in Pushkara woods It's the Spring Festival tomorrow. But I'll send her - Promise? - Yes One can't win a woman by raving and ranting And look at your dress Patience. That's the secret Hurry up! There's a Revolution at stake Patience! When the guards see this they must appreciate my art We have to free Aryak, and you talk of art! Is there no place for art in Revolution? No The kind of people one has to associate with for fame! Aryak, run away. We'll handle the guards - What's that? - It's the Spring Festival Don't you like it? Not today I want to spend the day alone with you Some other day No, today. Let's go to the Pushkara woods Everyone will be in the city. No one in the woods Poor fellow! This is the festival of courtesans They won't let me go out through the streets Everyone knows me I'll send you a covered cart. Get ready A cart will be eXpensive today I'll give him this... something Take this... only for the cart! Don't gamble it away! - Are you Charudatt's maid? - No, his wife I have some sandal paste for your bath There's nothing else in the house worthy of you You are not angry with me? I thought you had gone to your father's house I had gone... but came back This was my one chance to meet the famous Vasantsena Once I was away, I knew you would come "Why does the heart tremble..." "...in the middle of the night?" "Because the 'Bela' bloomed..." "...in the middle of the night" "Who played the flute in the middle of the night" "He who stole the moments... ...in the middle of the night" - Mother! - What do you want, Rohit? Come here Can I go out and play? Yes. Here, here's a cart for you I made it for you Isn't it nice? Rohit, come You know who that it - That too is your Mother. - My Mother? Then how come she wears so much of gold? You talk too much Sorry, but he has never seen me wear any gold Never? Then why not put these on? For a while - Come, change - Not here. Inside No, no, it is yours now No, it's yours... will remain yours It's pretty Don't part with it "The jewellery glistens... ...In the middle of the night" "Guard it with care... ...In the middle of the night" "Oh, how I blush in the middle of the night" "May your marriage be safe. In the middle of the night" Rohit! I don't want him to see me like this. Help me! What is it, Rohit? The other children won't play with him Because his is a clay cart. They have carts of gold Don't cry. I'll tell Father. He will get you a gold cart What is Mother doing? Changing. Don't cry, I'll be back There is your cart of gold Isn't it nice? Go play Aren't I like your Mother now? "Why does the heart tremble in the middle of the night?" "Because the 'Bela' bloomed in the middle of the night" Can I ask you something? Why don't you resent me? There are several reasons Firstly, rich men should have courtesans A courtesan like you makes me feel rich What else? Nothing Tell me We have been married seven years He was... alright... nothing eXciting It was getting quite boring But after he spent that night with you... ...he was... like... like Like that! Boom! Any other reason? You're much older. If you were young, I'd be jealous Are you the cartman of the King's brother-in-law? Yes. I am! Madam regrets. Vasantsena didn't come home last night That devil will eat me up! Is this Charudatt's house? Tell Vasantsena he has sent this cart for her Out of the way, you rascals! I am late already! I'm ready, Madam Vasantsena I'll turn the cart round Good, Madam. Let's go - Anybody inside? - No - Seen Aryak. - No I must inspect the cart You are right. It's empty Quick! The mirror! It is not straight Come here. You! - All right? - Very nice She is coming... Those idiots don't understand She'll come, I'm sure. I've got myself an amulet It is very late I am sure the old cartman is slow Keep calm I know, I am eXcitable So I got the court poet to write lines of welcome Come Come, Vasantsena Light of my life Stop it Stop it, you idiot You are to start when you see her cart arrive Listen Come Bunch of morons Why are you nodding your head like a chameleon? She is here! She is here! - Control yourself - Yes, yes Come, Vasantsena I'm sorry, Sir. But she hasn't come She wasn't at home She didn't return all night You should've searched the whole city, you old vulture! God, I came here in search of Peace. But where is it? Not here. I'll go elsewhere You have come! You were only teasing me What an old fool I am! I should've known you'd come Why are you so shy? We are alone. You know I chased everybody away Charudatt? - Who's Charudatt? You came not for me, but for somebody else? I send my cart, I wait. You come for someone else! I won't let you go! I'll tear you to pieces! Say you've come for me Say it Say it! Say it! Sir What's the matter? Can I be of help? Go away. Leave me alone Did you call me? I am Charudatt So it is you It's for you she came She died because of you You killed her Murderer! You killed her! Arrest him. He has killed Vasantsena Vasantsena hasn't arrived yet But she went by... ...in a cart a while ago There! He lies Go and look. She is dead I want witnesses We are posted here to look for Aryak. We can't leave Damn Aryak. I order you... I am the King's brother-in-law Poor thing And no jewellery on her? She has been robbed That's right. He killed her for the jewellery Come, you are my witnesses There's a shorter route through the woods Good. The earlier we finish this, the better Charudatt looks so innocent Vasantsena was taken in by his looks Where are the jewels? He must have smuggled them out with the cartman But today is the Festival... Festival or not, I'll see he is eXecuted today No Peace here either! What was the madman saying! Charudatt killed Vasantsena Is that possible? No. The illusory world is answering me again I reject this "Maya". I'll go far and meditate Madam, we are late. He is probably wandering about Please wait. I'll look for him Who are you? Stop! Stop! Where are you taking my cart? Stop! I've had enough. I'll leave this country and go away "My mind plays out like the drum" "My body vibrates like cymbals" "A strange ecstasy fills the world" "For Eros has brought colours of the Spring" She is alive "Maya" ensnares me again. I shall not resist God, I don't know if I am a good hermit There must be some reason why I am a good masseur "Oh fair maid, where are you stealing away?" "What do you hide under your veil?" "Yonder is green..." "How can I hide my youth?" "We shall catch you, fair maid" "Hand over to us what you are hiding" Hear ye! The King declares that... ...Charudatt is condemned to death for murder Brother, killing a man even as punishment is not easy Vasantsena! Come and dance We're late. Streets are all blocked by drunken revelers - We must attack the palace. - But how? I know a secret route to the palace Take about a dozen men Let the rest try their luck with the streets - Good-bye - Aren't you coming with us? No. Whoever the King, his soldiers will be after me Hope the soldiers pursuing me tomorrow will be yours Charudatt, make your final statement Hurry up - It's the Law, sir. Proceed I have made many mistakes in my life But I have never wished anyone any harm I didn't kill her. I loved her I must be paying for the sins of my past life I accept my fate After you - You first - No, it's your turn - Your's - I did it last time - Go, check Get on with it You are right. Pity! Stop! What is happening? Don't cry, Aditi. It is my fate Mercy, sir. He is not guilty She left her jewellery at our house You like this? This is why I've been saying hurry up It's my fault. I accepted the jewellery He didn't kill her - He did, he killed her I'll not spare him Why humiliate ourselves. Let me die with dignity Good-bye. Knowing you are there gives me courage Behead me before my wife recovers Your turn Stop! Get up! Get up! Vasantsena is alive! You are saved What's all this? He was accused of killing her. She lives! Let him go! Truly? You are free then But the King's orders mention no Vasantsena! Only a "courtesan" - I am that courtesan Yes, this is she I should know. I saved her Let's ask Samsthanak He's here? Where? He is the real culprit Vasantsena is alive! Bastard that I am... I tried to kill her Thank you, God! She's alive! He's disappeared. What do we do now? We are revolutionaries. Let us pass Greetings! Aryak is the new King! - Sajjal, one last favour. - No, I must see Madanika This drunken mob won't listen. Change the flag All right. "Last favour" Sajjal, what are you doing there? I'm here. Waiting. Come here at once! What grace! What agility! We must keep our eyes on him. A case worth tudying. Halt! Hear ye! There's been a revolution in the city The tyrant is dethroned. Aryak is the new King Amnesty has been declared. All prisoners are free. Lucky man! Where is Vasantsena? Let's go home. Rohit will be crying Look! The brother-in-law of the King
