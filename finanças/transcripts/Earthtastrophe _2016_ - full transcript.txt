[ music playing ] [ insects chirping ] [ overlapping chatter ] [ soft jazz playing ] Hey. Hey, hi. MAN: Sure is something to look at. You were smart to pick her. [ glasses clink ] [ rumbling ] [ crowd murmuring ] My God. [ lights crackling ] [ man coughs ] [ overlapping chatter, coughing ] [ woman sobs ] Stay here. My sweet success. MAN: Colin, we can fix this. [ overlapping voices ] WOMAN: Colin. SECOND MAN: That's what scares me. We're all in this together. Are you okay? MAN: Stop him now! [ voices continue ] WOMAN: Colin, we are all real. Nothing a little adrenaline can't fix. [ gasping ] You think it's bad now? [ gasps ] Stay away! [ overlapping chatter ] [ groans ] MAN: One, two, seven Grand. Do you read me? Over. One, two, seven Grand. Do you copy? Over. One, two, seven Grand... Hey. Colin? One, two, seven Grand.... Hey. Hey! Hey! Where's he going? I don't know. Look, I'm gonna go get him, okay? Hey, hey, hold on! What? Put your gear on. There's a storm coming. All right, all right, all right. Come on. Everybody. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Colin! Hey, Colin! Colin, stop! Stop! Colin! Keep going. Colin! Get him! Stop him! Colin. Door's locked! [ wind howling ] Get the gates! Come on! Push! [ chorus vocalizing ] [ soft jazz playing ] [ overlapping chatter ] Ahh. She sure is something to look at. You were smart to pick her. Happy New Year's, Danny. [ glasses clink ] Where are we going? Trying to get you to a medic, Colin, to take care of you, but you're not making it easy on us! Come on! Let's go! Stay with me. Come on, man! This is aged 17 years, oak barrels. It's a damn shame to waste it on a punk like this. Brennen! This is gonna sting a bit. Aah! Aah! WOMAN: I thought I'd lost you. [ overlapping voices ] Colin. Are you okay? [ crackling ] MAN: We're getting closer. The storms are increasing. We're running out of time! Hey, Colin, are you okay? There was someone else in here just now. What? [ stammering ] What happened to me? What happened out there? Am I crazy, seeing things? I don't know. Maybe. Come on. Let's sit down. That storm, there were two suns in the sky. Yeah. You remember that. I just saw it. I-- You just saw it again. Come on. Have a seat. Come on. Right there. Check your back pocket. "Your name is Colin. You lost your memory in the event." Wait. What event? Keep reading. "Last New Year's Eve, a great disaster consumed our planet." "Earth is now in another solar system." That's two suns and five moons. No, no, no, that's not-- that's not possible. Yeah, I've been telling myself the same thing every day, and yet here we are. Come on. I need you to follow my finger. All right. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Stop the test! New Year's Eve. How long have things been like this? Almost a year. A year? I've lost a year? Yes, Colin, and you should be thankful. Billions of people lost their lives. I'm dreaming. I'm dreaming. This is a nightmare. Trust me. It is very real. Aah! Wait. I-- My wife. Who? Aah! My wife, my kid, they're out there somewhere. Okay, you've never mentioned them before. No, I need to go find them. Hey, you're not going out there. You need to rest. I've rested long enough. We'll be the judge of that. No, you won't! Hey, tough guy, listen. We've been taking care of you for almost a year. Do you think that's been easy? No, you don't need to go outside and have another lapse, and you certainly don't want to put the people who saved you in danger again. But what if she thinks that I'm-- It's been almost a year. I'm sorry, Colin, but she's probably gone. The whole world has been ravaged. There's not many of us left. The ones here, we do our best to save, and that includes you. Your memory is coming back, but let's not push it. Come on. This is one, two, seven Grand. We're in desperate need of food and gas and medical supplies. Do you copy? This is one, two, seven Grand. We need food-- We're losing power again. Aw, Jesus. No gas, no lights. See? This radio is a drain. We gotta keep trying. Just keep trying, Marty. Come on. Look, there's still gas out there, and we're gonna have to find it. Right. Preferably before one of those hail bombs sends me to an early grave. Marty, I need you to go in with him. Me? I'm manning the radio. No, I gotta take over that for you, okay? I need you to do this. Come on. Let's get a move on it. Things don't stay quiet around here for too long. All right, we're going, Jack. We are going. We are going to get our asses killed. Can I go out with someone else? What? Just go before things get worse. [ sighs ] [ laughs ] Right. Shit gets worse. You know what? That's the funniest thing I've heard all day. [ laughs ] Yeah. Hey, be careful. Mm-hmm. This is one, two, seven Grand. Come in. [ sighs ] [ rumbling ] Well, the proofs are in. What do you think of that, huh? It's perfect, right? Nah, something's not right. What, are you a perfectionist? We could sell this to the government, double our money, and not have to worry about the little stuff! I knew I smelled something. Smell of success. [ chuckles ] [ rumbling ] [ overlapping chatter outside ] All right, Rip Van, let's go before another storm gets in. See, I've been carrying your ass for nearly a year now, and I hear that you're right as rain, so it's time for you to earn your keep. Hey, where we going? So those things falling from the sky? Methane. They say it gets trapped in the upper atmosphere, freezes in those huge crystals, and falls from the sky like bombs. It's fun. Ah, that's nothing, man. The e-clouds, that's what scares the shit out of me. E-clouds? Oh, that's right, man. You don't remember. Like thick fog. Yeah, except there's two million volts of electricity flowing through 'em. You don't remember any of this? Look, man, I'm telling you, it's the e-clouds. It's messing with our brain. It's, like, screwing up our wiring. All that electricity just flowing through the air, cooking us from the inside out. I'm telling you, man, we're being zombified. [ wind blowing ] All right. Keep your eyes open, and if you find anything, let us know, all right? And don't pocket anything! Jack will check you when you get back. Eyes open for what? Things for survival. What else? Mainly food, gas for the generators, and medical supplies. Aw, man. You gotta be kidding me. [ sighs ] Man, look. There ain't nothing here. They took everything. Colin... Yeah. go find some gas. MARTY: Look for a boiler room. Please hurry, before a storm comes. O-Okay. Okay. [ thunder crashes ] [ hollow can thumps ] Hallelujah! What? What, what, what? What'd you find? What'd you find? Pinto beans. Oh, yeah. Real jackpot. Colin, your wife and child are here. Hey. [ overlapping chatter ] Everyone, stay calm! Oh... [ woman screams ] My God. Hey! You got food in that bag? No. Hey. Hey! Hey! Stop! I need that bag! Hey! Hey! Come back! Hey! Hey! Lord, you... Hey. Stop! Where the hell is he going? Colin! Hey. Hey, where you going?! MARTY: Colin! Hey! What the hell are you doing out here?! Are you crazy?! Get back inside! That cloud hits, we're dead! Hey! What the hell are you guys doing?! Out of the way! No! Colin, run! Run, and take cover! Hey! Wait! Hey! Stop! Shit. Hello? Hello? I know you're hiding in here. Look, you can keep my bag. I just want the book. Don't turn around! I have a gun, and I swear I will shoot you. Put your hands up. All right. All right. That's enough of that, okay? Please, don't shoot. What? I just-- Don't hurt me. Look, I'm really confused right now, okay? Look, I just need the cards in that bag. You can keep the rest. Deal? He's not gonna let you have them back. Who's-- Me. Is that for me? [ chuckles ] Ah, I knew I smelled something. The smell of success. We could sell this to the government, double our money, and not have to worry about the little stuff. [ beeping ] This is his technology. I'm just carrying out his dream the way he wanted it to be done. Is that enough to get started? Hey. Hey. You with me? Yeah. Yeah, relax. Oh, God. What are these? Memories. Huh. It's for me. It's personal. My family's out here somewhere. I need to try and find them. Your family's out there and you haven't seen 'em yet, your family's dead, just like mine. Get up. Hey, don't-- [ grunts ] All right, sleeping dipshit, food. You have it. We want it. No. That's what I came here to find was food and supplies. Look, I'm telling you, that's what we came here to find! You think those clouds juggled his brains? Like they did yours? Yeah, they probably messed with his memory. He's got amnesia or something. Well, how convenient. But you know what that means. You're no good to me. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Alex, don't! You have exactly three seconds to give me one good reason why I shouldn't kill you. One... Alex. two... Wait, wait, wait, wait! Wait! Wait! Money. Money. I have money, a lot of money, cash, in a safe in my office, I swear. I'm sorry. Is this a joke? Wait, wait, wait, wait. How much we talking? A hundred grand, maybe more, if you help me find my office building. Well, hell, if you ain't lying, you wouldn't be able to find your own ass with two hands and a road map. No, no, no. My book. My book. No. My book. There's a building... with this logo on it. See? Yeah, and I know the building with the logo, but we need food, not money, Alex. It's a lot of money. Forget the money! Shut up! I've been hearing a lot of rumors, okay? Word is spreading! And you heard the same thing! We are not getting back! Shut your trap, Zoey. I'm not just making this stuff up! No, you're too smart for that. Whoa, whoa. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Making what up? Nothing! Go ahead. Tell him! People have been saying that whatever happened a year ago is gonna happen again, but this time, it's gonna take us home. That's right! And if it does happen, what's the big deal with going back with an extra 100K in hand? It's useless! You do whatever you want. Zoey and I are gonna go find food. [ gasps ] Hey. You go where I go. Now, you can search the building for food, but I'm getting that money, and you're coming with, both of you! You got that? Yeah. Huh? Good. Get up! All right. Okay, okay. There's no money, you die. If there's no food, you die. If you try anything, you die. You got that? [ thunder crashing ] I told you he couldn't go! I told you, and now Marty's dead! The guy was a liability, and we've been carrying him long enough! That wasn't your decision to make. Like hell, it was! Our supplies are running out! My supplies! All right. My goodwill only goes so far. Oh, your goodwill only goes so far, huh? Well, it takes us to survive this, okay? We have to work together, so you're gonna have to go back out there. That is crazy. I'm not going-- Do you understand me? Gerry! Go with him. Go. Now. Please. Let's go. [ chorus vocalizing ] WOMAN: Keep going! We're not clear yet! ALEX: This way. [ faint chatter ] COLIN: So this is the underground? You were expecting the botanical gardens? No, I just heard it was dangerous. [ sighs ] You know any place that isn't right now? Wait. Zoey, check his pockets. You check his pockets. I'm not touching that. I said check his pockets! Check 'em! I am sick of you pointing that gun at us. We are not your prisoners. Hey. Hey. I'm the one who keeps you alive! Right?! Okay. You got that? All right, that's enough! There we go. There we go. That's two strikes, and there won't be a third. Now you're on borrowed time. Let's move. Hey. Hey. Real charming guy you got there. We're still alive, aren't we? Yeah, for right now, anyway. Move. Move. We've got sick kids in tents two and three, and we need antibiotics. We are completely out. Anything else you need... boss? Our medical supplies are dangerously low. Yeah. Right. Look, sooner we go, sooner we get back. You hope so. Hey, Jack. You know what? They can't go. A nasty report just came over the radio. These storms, they're getting worse, much worse. They have to go. Jack, if you send them out there, they don't come back. BRENNEN: Hey, hey, hey! I'll go. Right? I'm-- I'm good. Gerry? I'm good. See? We're good. Thank you. Let's go. Come on. We got tent two and three to deal with. Come on. [ thunder crashes ] The storm is coming back. [ screaming ] My God. Nope. We gotta go back. No, no, that's it. Over there. Come on. Let's go! ZOEY: He's gonna get us all killed! Come on. Okay. [ groans ] Whoa. [ grunts ] This place is a deathtrap. Come on! Come on! Come on! Your office! Where's your office! Where is it? Couple floors up. Your office now! We'll check every floor if we have to! All right. Um... Eighth floor, geniuses. Eighth floor. The eighth floor! Stairs! We need stairs! All right. Stairs! I don't know. Come on, come on! Come on! I'm going, all right? Take it easy. Come on! I'm looking. I'm looking. [ rumbling ] [ grunts ] My future is tied to your decisions. Happy New Year's, Danny. You built an empire. It's perfect, right? Hey! What? What? Stop stalling, and find it. All right. All right. [ rumbling ] Okay. ALEX: Come on! Here. Here. This is it. What, you owned the whole building? Uh, yeah, I guess. Go in! All right. You guys stay here, and you wait. Okay, okay, okay. Find it! The proofs are in. It's perfect, right? WOMAN: Colin, your wife and child are here. She sure is something to look at. You were smart to pick her. Nah. Something's not right. They're not real. What are you doing? Find it! It's--Give me a second! It's-- We don't have any time! Come on! Hold on! Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. It's here. It's here. Okay, open it! Open it! Come on! I am! Hang on! Uh--[ groans ] How 'bout I help you remember... Give me a second! huh? Come on! Come on! I'm working on it! [ pad beeping ] That's it! Okay. All right, I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. Come on. Come on! Money! Where's the money? I want the money! Where is it? It's right... Come on. It's right here. [ groans ] All right. All right. All right. E-cloud. E-cloud! Now you die! Strike three! [ groans ] You're out. Go on! Get outta here! Go, go, go! All right, come on. Come on! Whoa! Okay. Over here. This way. This way. This way. Come on. ALEX: I'll kill you! Come on. Come on. Come on. Keep going! Keep going! Don't touch any metal! [ screams ] Zoey? Zoey. No. Zoey? Hey. Zoey. Get down! All right. The storms are increasing. It's you. What was that? Oh, this? It's a homemade e-cloud dispersement unit. I like to call her Bertha. Now come on. Let's go! Her head. This is one, two, seven Grand. Come in. This is one, two, seven Grand. Come in. [ rumbling ] [ crowd screaming ] The entire area is becoming unstable. Have you seen Brennen or Gerry? No. Jack, we really need to think about moving. Move? Are you crazy? Can we at least load the trucks? And go where? This is one, two, seven-- Jack! I heard you. I heard you. This is one, two, seven Grand. Come in. This is one, two, seven Grand. Come in. Gerry, Brennen, do you read me? [ gasps ] [ coughs ] Nothing a little adrenaline can't fix. What happened? I thought I'd lost you. Nothing a little adrenaline can't fix. Okay. Easy. I feel like I've been hit by a train. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! What? I saved the kid. Can we go now? No, no, no, no! I've seen you before in my visions. I don't know how to explain this. Okay, you were there. You were in the tent with me. There's no way that's possible, man. Wait! Look! I'm not making this up, okay? You were in there! You said that exact same thing about the adrenaline! All right, look. I'm not making this up. Trippy shit. All right, I've heard that people's minds got warped and whatnot. Wait. He's not confused? He might not be. Okay, the moment we went through, space and time, it was warped and folded, right? You could be having a future memory. [ rumbling ] All right. Guys, we don't have time to explain this. We need to go right now. Come on. Let's go. Let's go! Yeah, yeah. Come on, guys. Let's go! All right, fine! Get in the truck! Let's go! Come on! Come on. What were you doing here? Preparing. For what? I was looking for something. For what? You think we're going back, don't you? Think? With any luck, I'll be the one that gets us there. Wow, trippy shit, man. Colin, you and I are meant to fix this. This is not a chance encounter. Okay, but what makes you think that you can get us back? Because I was an engineer at Fuel X Corp. This is Jasper Borash. He's part of the fuel cell team. [ echoing ] Are you--Are you-- Are you all right? Are you okay? I was in part responsible for the technology that I believe was used to create the wormhole in the first place, nuclear-- Fuel cells. Stop the test! What, are you your father? Come on. He died without any major accomplishments. Danny, this is his technology. Aah! You think that the Earth just happened upon a wormhole that slingshot us across the galaxy? No way. No way. Someone or something opened up that wormhole. All right, look, we're in the safe zone of those two suns up there, okay? One is a good distance away, but we're currently being pulled towards the other, and when that happens, it's gonna consume the entire planet, and we're running out of time to fix it. Hey. Hey. Hey, buddy. Hey, Colin! It's okay. What's he doing? Are you--Are you-- Are you okay? You don't-- You don't look so hot. No. Uh, no. Sorry. Excuse me. Sure, sure. [ overlapping chatter, laughter ] WOMAN: Colin. We're running out of time! Colin! Are you okay? I was worried-- I think someone put something in my drink. [ mutters ] Okay, here we go. Nice and easy. Nice and easy. There we go. Back it up. Back it up. There we go. Okay. [ sighs ] JASPER: Whoo! Well, welcome to my home. Hmm. At least your house is still standing. Good, 'cause I don't have apocalypse insurance. But I do have power. [ generator whirring ] [ Jasper sighs ] Oh, man. How's he doing? Not so good. Let's see what we got here. Hey, buddy. Let's check and see. [ gasps ] Jeez! Don't do that to me! I saw... Jesus, man. saw--I saw myself. You what? I saw myself seeing the disaster. New Year's Eve. You were there. Wait. That's not possible. I've talked to survivors who have claimed the same sort of thing. It's-- It's like you're-- It's like you're living in a time loop between two dimensions. That's the only way that you saw me and saw yourself. Holy turd on a stick. Einstein's doing cartwheels in his grave right about now. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. What? Wait. Wait, wait, wait. What? What? What? There was rumors. There was rumors that you had a-- a working prototype. The original fuel cell. Is that true? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I had it in my safe at my office. Are you sure? I think so. "Think" isn't good enough. We only have one shot. O-Okay! Yes. Yes, it was there. I'm positive. Okay. What about it? Okay, all right, so listen. If--If you had the prototype and-- and you don't have it--you don't have it now, then that means... must have been there then, that night. Of course. Yes. The government. Oh, boy. No, the government. If they knew of a working prototype, then they would want to steal it. They wouldn't want another one around. Exactly. Okay, Colin, listen to me. Somehow, you're living in two different dimensions, okay? And you're communicating with yourself. We can use that. W-We can use what? What are you talking about? Okay. You have to get a message to yourself. What? [ stammers ] Get a message? How-- How am I going to do that? Okay, theoretically, if you're having these visions, then that means that you're communicating to yourself subconsciously. Subconsciously? Okay, all right. Ohh. Okay, this is very, very important, okay? Colin, you have to get the fuel cell to the test facility. We don't have a lot of time. If we can get it there, then we can repeat the test. We can actually open up the wormhole and send the Earth back through it. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. They were performing the testing that night. Wouldn't the whole place be surrounded by government agents? Yeah, of course it would. Great. No, see, that's okay, 'cause it's the last place that they would expect you to take it. Okay, Colin, listen to me. When do you most have these visions? Uh, when I'm knocked out or coming to. Of course. Of course. Okay, all right, listen. You need to get this message to yourself. You need to say this, okay? "Get the prototype. Take it to the facility." Can you say that? Get the prototype. Take it to the facility. How does that help us? Just say it with me. BOTH: Get the prototype. Take it to the facility. Good. Say it one more time. Get the prototype. Take it to the-- [ shrieks ] We have reached a whole new level of crazy. Oh, God. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. [ water running ] "Get the fuel cell." Prototype. Take it to the facility. [ overlapping chatter ] Are you okay? I was worried. People were looking for you. I'm fine. Where's Danny? I don't know. I haven't seen him. Look, why don't you just relax and enjoy the evening? I can't. Please, don't do anything. Just act normal. What are you doing? I don't know. Colin. Colin. Colin. You put him in a coma. No. Listen. Leave him alone, okay? The longer he's out, the better of a chance we have. Oh, that makes sense. Yeah, it does to me, okay? [ sighs ] You know what? I need a minute. I need a minute. [ sighs ] It's not safe here for long. That sun is getting closer. We're not safe anywhere for long. The sun is gonna fry us all and soon. You really think this is gonna work? [ sighs ] I don't know. Maybe. And don't tell them that. Why do you ask? I don't know. In a crazy, weird way, things are actually better for me now than before it happened. [ sighs ] Colin. Colin. Colin! Yes. There you go. He's awake! [ groans ] I feel like I got hit by a truck. Hey. Hey. Hey. What, what, what? Did you see anything? Uh... yeah. I was-- I was at the party... and they were shooting at me. Okay. What about the fuel cell? Do you remember anything about that? [ laughs ] Why do you think they were shooting at me? [ laughs ] Mother of all mind trips. It freaking worked! Yeah. Yeah, it worked. Now what? I was hoping-- I guess the-- the backup generators wouldn't be working at the facility. I was hoping to get enough gas to power them now, but... I've been too busy and concerned with this. A fuel cell from scratch? I had to try something, man. But--But now-- now a fully operational prototype is within our reach. Yeah, with some... interdimensional telepathy across space and time. Yeah, sure. Sounds--Sounds great. No power. That, too. Gas. We just need gas. We need to get gas. Yeah, let's just go back to city, huh? Ehh. No. Uh, radio, shortwave or Ham. What about 'em? Do you have one? Yeah, of course I do. All right. Get that baby up and running. I've got an idea. "Hate. Kid younger. Wife should be brunette or redhead"? I can't believe it. What can't you believe? Since I lost my memory... nothing has been real. I have been chasing after a wife I don't have and a kid who doesn't exist. They're models, models for the brochure. It was a memory I manufactured. [ sighs ] I wake up in this hell that I created, and the one-- the one memory that had any meaning to me isn't real. I can't do this. Colin. I can't do this. Colin. Colin. What? I'm real. Zoey's real. Jasper is real. This whole thing is real. We're all in this together. You know, you weren't the only one that the event changed. You know Zoey? She was a runaway. My fianc? broke up with me the night of the event about a block away from your building. I ran outside to get a cab, and that's when that little rat tried to steal my purse. You stole my cab. Anyway, there was a flash of light. You know what happened next, and we've been together ever since. [ sighs ] Sorry. Don't say you're sorry. Come on. Quit the pity party. You can do this, Colin. You can do this. [ chuckles ] Oh, I hate to break up this beautiful moment, but I've got one ham radio at your service. Everyone, please stay calm! It's going to be okay! COLIN: ...Grand... you copy... Colin Pri... Brennen? Can anyone hear me? [ garbled transmission continues ] Please, if you can hear me. [ static buzzing ] Ah, come on, Colin. This is our only chance. You have to keep trying. This is Colin Prite. Grand 127, do you copy? I repeat-- This is Colin Prite. Sarah, please, if you can hear me... [ static buzzing ] This is useless. This is Sarah at Grand 127. Sarah. Thank God. Listen to me. Who is this? It's Colin. Jack! Get in here! It's Colin. He's alive. Colin, are you okay? I'm fine. Look, it's a long story, and I wish I had time to explain. I need your help. What's going on? I need gas. You and half the world, man! Listen, I need you to trust me on this. I don't have time to explain everything. All the gas you have, we need it. Colin, this is Jack. We're getting hammered over here by a storm. That is absolutely impossible. Listen to me. I know this sounds crazy, but we can fix this. The wormhole, I can send us back through, but you are going to have to trust me. Us going back through that wormhole is a rumor, Colin. No, it's not! And the only way you'll see that is if you give me a chance. No. Colin. Colin, that gas we use saves people's lives. How many lives? 20? 50? 100? I'm talking about saving everybody. [ screaming ] Look, if he's wrong, that is it, okay? That's it! We're toast! SARAH: Maybe you're still a little confused, Colin. No offense. I have never been more clear. I can do this. All the gas you have, we need to load it up, get it to the Fuel X Corp. facility. It's on the outskirts of town just past the 10 on Firestone. [ grunts ] This is our one and only chance. I need you to trust me. [ static whining ] No, no, no, no, no. [ beeps ] [ static buzzing ] What happened? We lost them. That didn't sound good. You think they're gonna do it? I think a better question is, "Did they make it?" [ static buzzing ] Easy. Easy. Easy. What if he's right? What? What if he's right? I don't know. Are you sure there's no other way to get that facility operational? Heh. I guess we're gonna find out. We all know who he is... what his company was working on. What are we doing but simply prolonging the inevitable? I mean, really, what do we have to lose? Are you serious? I'd rather have hope, hope in a real future, hope in a real future instead of waiting for our inevitable demise. Come on! Hey, I don't care what he says. I don't care whether he's right or if he's wrong. We gotta move now, guys! This place is coming down! Let's go. Let's go. Go. [ screaming ] Everyone, get to the bunker! Move, move, move! It's not safe! Come on! Come on. Let's go. All right, guys, we gotta go! Let's go. Come on, everybody! It's gonna blow! Here we go! Here we go! COLIN: Great. How the heck are we gonna make it through that? [ overlapping chatter ] Wait. Hey! Stop! Hey! On the bike, headed south! WOMAN: You guys... Oh, God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God! Watch out! Watch out! Watch out! [ grunts ] [ all groaning ] COLIN: Hey, you okay? WOMAN: Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay. Hey, Jasper. Oh, God. Jasper. Come on. I'll help you out. Come on. Come on. [ grunts ] Come on. Okay, okay, okay. Okay. Oh, God. Okay. Put your head back. Put your head back. Hey. Hey. Colin, listen to me. I'm not gonna make it. No, no, no. W-We'll get you some help. You have to get the facility up and running. How? How am I gonna do that without you? It's gonna be easy. [ coughs ] The gas generators will power the capacitor. [ coughing ] Okay. The capacitor... will get the facility up and running, and the fuel cell will take care of the rest. It self-generates power. [ coughs ] And lots of it. [ coughs ] Oh, shh. This wasn't fun, Colin. Let's not do this again. Jasper. [ coughing ] Oh, God. Hey, hey, hey, hey, Jasper. Jasper? Jasper? Jasper! Jasper! Get the gun. Come on. Where's this fuel cell? It's in here somewhere. Where? Where? Where? Where? Thought I saw something on the monitor there. Okay. Let's check it out. Okay. Coming. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait. Hey! Stop! Where's the prototype? I don't know. Where's the prototype? Hello, Colin. Dad. Your father... didn't he die penniless? Piss it all away chasing his foolish dreams? I'm not selling. I don't want them turning this into a weapon. Where is it? [ gun fires ] [ bullet ricochets ] You thieving son of a bitch! How's that feel, huh? Where's the prototype? It's not in here! Put it in the bag! Okay, okay. Don't shoot! Stop him! [ gunfire ] Stop him now! Dan, you have to stop the test. You're going to destroy everything. The test is progress. They have a working prototype. Did you do that? You know where the real money lies. We could sell this to the government, double our money, and not have to worry about the little stuff. Danny, I'm not selling. I don't want them turning this into a weapon. Whatever. You're making a mistake. Daniel, when we roll out these fuel cells-- I can't wait for them to roll out! I need money, Colin. I need it now. That enough to get started? It'll help. You have no idea what this is going to do! Looks like I gotta go. You see, there's gonna be a big show, and I got a front-row seat, but when I return... you're gonna give me that fuel cell. [ laughs ] Don't make a mistake you're gonna regret the rest of your life. Give me the bag! Okay. Being in business with you, that's my only regret. Where is it? Wait, wait, wait. It's... It's in here. Drop it! Drop it! I swear to God! Drop it! Hey! Stop! [ chuckles ] Drop it, I swear to God! Drop it! Keys. Keys, come on! We need power. JACK: Colin! Wait. Did you hear that? Sarah? SARAH: Colin! Colin! Yes. It's not over. JACK: Colin! Oh, thank God! Man, I'm so damn tired of saving your ass, kid. Only one more time. Come on. All right. All right, look. Here we go. We gotta hurry. Backup generator's in here. Hurry! Come on! We need to power this place up. Let's go. Initiate the system. Copy. System initiating. Where's the generator? It's in here. It's in here. It's in here. Is this it? Corner! Corner! Right over there. That's it. All right, gas in right now. Let's go. Let's go. All right, what about the fuel cell? I gotta get down to the main centrifuge, but I need power first. So this is gonna power this place and open a wormhole, huh? That's the plan. Damn! All right, come on, come on, come on! It's good. It's good. Cap it off. Cap it off. All right, come on. Come on. Okay. Easy. Please, please, please, please, please. Come on, please. Come on! [ cheering ] Yes! All right, let's go! Look, we gotta go! We gotta hurry! Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Ho. All right, we're looking for a lab. Okay, I'm gonna go this way. Danny! Stop the test! Hey. That's it! There's the lab! SARAH: Brennen, e-cloud! Watch out! Ahh! Go, go, go! Get him! Brennen. Aah! SARAH: Hey! COLIN: Brennen. You okay? JACK: Go. You gotta go. COLIN: Stay with him! Stay with him! All right, go. Stay out here! Don't follow me in! [ computer alarm blaring ] What's happening? I don't know. What do you mean you don't know? Shut it down. I can't. What do you mean you can't?! Danny! Shut it down! I can't! [ fuel cell humming ] Colin, hurry up! We're in a coffin here! It's booting up! Initiating! Shut it down! I'm trying! It's not responding! Shut it down! Colin! Colin! He's down! Let's go! No! Come on! What happened? Nothing. Nothing happened. It didn't work. It's over. [ sobs ] It's over. I tried, guys. I tried. [ rumbling ] Everybody... hold on! Aah! CROWD: ...one! Happy new year! [ cheering ] Happy New Year, Mr. Prite. You, too, Penelope. Not enjoying yourself? Are you? I like parties. You know your father would be proud, right? Thank you. That means a lot to me. Did you just thank me? PENELOPE: You still want to replace her? I mean, she is your "wife," after all. She's fine. She's not my wife. Colin. Happy New Year, bud. Hope this is the year we get that government contract, huh? Hey, Danny... Yeah? [ guests murmuring ] Happy New Year. You're fired. Colin, is everything all right? PENELOPE: Mr. Prite! [ breathing deeply ] [ fireworks popping ] I'm going to Koreatown. Whoa! That's my purse! Let go! What are you doing? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Zoey, give her her purse back. Who are you? Thank you. What? Nadia. Thank you. Yeah. Hop in the cab. Where are we going? What's going on? [ chuckles ] Trust me. It's a long story. Hop in the cab. Don't I know you? Sort of. I'll explain. Come on. Come on. COLIN: Happy New Year's. NADIA: So, who are you really? ZOEY: And how do you know us? COLIN: Like I said, it's a long story. [ instrumental playing ]
