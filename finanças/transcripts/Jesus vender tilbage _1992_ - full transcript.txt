(engaging dramatic music) I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness. Today is the Day of Judgment. There was never a time like this in all the history of humanity. We are ending in a heap of junk, dying in our own shit. The ax is already at the root of the tree. So take you heed be careful, the world is in danger. A great ball of fire is consuming the air. You'll hear of wars and of suffering and of death, and hail will come down mingled with fire and blood, and smite all the living plants and animals in the fields, on the seas, smoke and dust shall be the lice of man and beast. The stars will disappear and nothing more shall be left. And on the ground mankind walking will die, screaming in agony and pain. The world will be divided by mighty screws and nations will fall and disappear, and the land will stink, stink, stink, stink. The air will smell and the ground will become corrupt and the waters will smite the world with plagues. Oh you generation of serpents, vipers, and swine. How can you escape the damnation of hell? The wrath is on its way. The end is near. Whereas troubles becomes too many, as doomsday approaches with the end of all time, the Lord God in his wisdom will rise again to rescue mankind, yes hear me now. He will send back the one to save us from destruction. His one and only son, Jesus. Jesus is coming. Jesus will return again. Jesus is here. Jesus. Jesus. Jesus!

Thank you and that big one over there, for both of us. Thank you. (whistles) There's something I have to ask you. Where are you from? Bethlehem. Bethlehem? I'm from Bethlehem. Where in Bethlehem? Well not in a very specific place. I was born in a stable. You know, we were very poor, just a stable. [Marianne] We were very poor too. Why are you looking at me that way? Come, ... ... come, move.

(passengers cajole and party) All precautions have now been taken for a safe landing. The situation can be very dangerous. The airport is very heavily guarded by police and military with full firepower. All visual identification has been removed. All signs now read Tripoli Airport, Tripoli. (people cajoling and partying) [Pilot] Roger, we're native. [General] You can still see the bottom, Father. Just keep your hands steady, you're at ease.

Okay, move, get down. Get down, get down, you fucks. This does not look like Tripoli. So, read the signs, what do you read? You think it's Disneyland? (engine roars) Dirty swine, they will never leave us alone. God dang them, and you have, got kielbasa. (slurring) What would you do if Jesus came back here, right now? Jesus can already come back, just like that. 30 terrorists and thieves up in the blue air. Just like, that, no. No, no, no, come on, I'm Jesus Christ. I'm here, I'm back, I'm Jesus. Jesus? I'm Napoleon Bonaparte. And you are a blasphemous, aren't you ashamed of yourself, aren't you, you blaspheminist? The day I see Jesus. All clear to land on runway 1-8. Roger, X-Ray Lima cleared to land. X-Ray Lima landing now on runway 1-8. X-Ray Lima, Tripoli Ground Control, we wish you a safe landing.

(grenade explodes) (ammunition jangles) Answer me, you were in on the plot, hmm? (hand slaps) You were in on the plot, weren't you? Answer me, you're the leader, no? You say that, I'm not. He is the leader. He must admit it. He claims to be Jesus too, ask him. What your name then, hmm? I say to you I am Jesus Christ. I was born in Bethlehem and I came here for... Jesus, a blasphemist, that's what he is, a blasphemist. He was in on the plot, that's certain. He was with them all the time. And he claimed to be Jesus, too, and that is very, very dangerous. Put him in jail, hang him. Kill him, just like that. What's your name and where you coming from? What's your name and where do you coming from? Even if it scares you, my name is Jesus. And I came from my father. Oh Jesus, don't believe him. Hang him. Take the evil by its root. Kill him! If I'm guilty, who is innocent? All the people you killed, they were human beings, but you people, you have such stone-cold hearts. That's what you have. Put him in prison! (spitting) (screaming in foreign language) (bluesy rock music) (sensationalist news music) Good evening. The grim leader and chief conspirator behind the bloody hostage taking and hijacking of a South American airplane the day before yesterday, has now been transferred to the home country of the airline. The President, Aldi Gomez y Vargas, has already issued a statement that the criminal is sure to be condemned to death and executed as soon as possible. We are able to bring a report from the landing site in South America, two hours ago. (protestors chant) The fact that such a dangerous criminal, claims to be our savior, Jesus Christ, has awakened worldwide protests. Demands for his execution have been raised by Muslims, and also of course, Christian societies all over the world. This morning, at 4 a.m., exactly two hours after landing, he was sentenced to death. Will the defendant rise? Will the defendant rise? Although you still hide your identity. [Jesus] My name is Jesus! Silence! Although you still hide your identity, and although we do not know your name or descent, you are condemned to death by hanging. The execution will be carried out one week from today. Wake up. (Latin guitar music) Do you want a cigarette? Do you want a cigarette? May I come in? May I come in? I've come here to help you. I've come here to help you prepare to meet your Lord. I just came from him. Don't joke, death is no joke. This is serious. What you must go through is no joke. When our Lord died on the cross even he said, "My God, my God, why did you leave me?" He did not die, and the words were: "You should be careful with those priests, you know, those with the long black robes. They look like sheep outside but inside sometimes they're wild, devouring wolves." (Jesus laughs maniacally) I've come here to pray with you. Pray, you can only pray alone. Go to your room, lock the door, ask for food, forgiveness, friendship. You know that very well, don't you? I've come here to help you, not to argue. Who do you think you are to talk to me like this? My name is Jesus. Oh Christ, you shouldn't continue this way. And if you continue this way I won't come back. You didn't come here to correct me. You are the criminal not me, so it is you who will take the consequences, not me. Oh, he's impossible. He's really evil. Don't call me gain. One of the most harmful I've ever met. You don't call me again. He says he's Jesus You want some coffee, priest? Yeah, thank you. Strange coincidence. That's strange, he looks like Jesus. Look, look don't you see? Don't you see? Oh it's a miracle. Oh, hallelujah, he said all the time he was Jesus. Oh, what an idiot I am. Oh look, he goes back again. Look, look. He's back, oh Jesus, he's back, he's back. He's back, oh he's back he's back. Oh Jesus, he's back, he's back. You fool, are you sure the door was locked? He's back, oh Jesus, Jesus is back again. Oh Lord, holy Lord, is it really you? Oh forgive me, forgive me, back after so many years. Oh Lord, I'm your servant, your humble servant, oh Lord. I can really see... Get up, cool it. Oh Lord, what can I do, oh Lord. Pull yourself together. Don't act like that. Don't be silly, man, stand up. Listen to me, I want to get out of here, please help me. Go, go, go. Yes Lord, yes Lord, Jesus, it's Jesus. (Latin guitar music) Hello, hello, Rome, the Vatican, give me the Pope. Yes hurry, it's urgent, yeah. Just a moment. (stammers) (phone rings) What? Is Jesus back? (speaks Latin) Impossible he doesn't come back. You want to see him, yeah, yeah, but he's here, he's right here, oh yes, yes. Swear? No, impossible. His holiness is in deep prayer. It is the hour of his reclusion and today he's praying for the poor in the world. What? What the hell? I shall try to reach the Pope. (bell rings) It's terribly important. What is it? Come along, advance. Father Leon has called from a South American prison. Listen now, listen. Oh my sweet little... Listen to me, I don't how I can say it. He says, he maintains, Jesus is back. What, are you sure? No, no, impossible. Take him out to be so superstitious. Richie, my sweet darling, my darling lovey-dovey, when you will you ever learn? There's been a miracle, a miracle. Very well, give it to me. Yes. Jesus is back, yes. Yes, he's really, yes sure, yes. Your holiness, he is back, oh yes, he's back, he's back. Yes, I have heard. What, are you saying that Jesus Christ been condemned to death again? Just like last time? Holy shit. Hello, we shall look into the matter immediately, in fact we shall send a committee. Yes, we shall send a committee. (jangly South American music) The Church has no procedure for proving that someone is Jesus, therefore we must have a clear sign. There's a hole in his hand. [Cardinal] Sir, he must be a holy man. Is it new? Oh yes, it's new. Are you sure that this hole wasn't there before? There was no hole, I swear. (Latin guitar music) Master, master, master, master. (Cardinal passes wind) Oh master, oh master, master, master. Oh master, master. (Cardinal passes wind) Is it you? Answer us in the name of the Lord, answer us. Answer me, are you forgiven or are you Jesus Christ? Answer us? Are you the one and only Son of our God? Or are you the devil? I'm not the devil, I'm Jesus, it's me. I'm back, I'm here. Please, put those things down. Don't be foolish friends. It's me. Why are you celebrating? I'm in the same shit as last time. In prison, condemned to death, like last time, and once more I have to see priests doing strange things around me, like last time. But now, look at me, friends. (Latin guitar music) (clergy exclaim in raptures) (Latin guitar music) Signori Cardinali, there is very, very serious matter before us today. I've invited you all to discuss a problem, which in its content is very dangerous. It is in fact, the most serious threat ever to the Holy Roman Church in our many years of history. Can any of you guess what it is? That I am talking about, anybody? In fact, it's tragic, terrible. Are you ready? Jesus Christ has returned. (clergy laugh) You don't believe me? Jesus Christ has come back to Earth. I swear to you, it's true. Where is he? In prison, of all things, he's condemned to death. [Cardinal] Like last time? Yes, and actually, that is a good thing. Because of this he must make a deal with us. What, you can't make a deal with Christ. Jesus is not a supermarket. He is condemned to death. He has no choice but to make a deal with us. Let us put the question this way, he could be very dangerous out there. He could spoil the whole business and we could go bankrupt. (religious music) I've been thinking about this over and over again since I saw him, why not let him stay in jail? Let him get killed. Chop chop! And nobody will ever hear about it. Better to have him killed. Last time it was the right thing to do. But if we do that, if we let him get killed, then there could be a new Christianity, and we could have stiff competition. Then, we cannot kill him, but we must control him. One Christianity is enough. Do you have any proof that he really is Jesus? Yes. He works wonders, we have seen them. He makes miracles. He has a hole in each palm. He shines like a sun. It's him, it's him, it's him! Truly, Gezemel? This is not the first time that they got people out of prison, they got Jean Genet, Theodorakis, Solschenizyn, Sartre, Nixon, Mandela, and have a lot, then we can get Jesus out. We get the special permission from the President. We give him a blanket absolution for a few years. Normally, that solves everything. [POPE] Signori Cardinali, Jesus must be our man. We must have the copyright of him. There can be no doubt about that. Either, here it is, to make a deal with us or we let him die. We are after all the Christian Church on Earth. He must be presented to the world in the church at St. Pietro, with me at his side. Or else he dies, but of course I'm sure that he will be reasonable, in fact, I'm sure he will be glad to let us make all the arrangements for him. We will make them properly. We cannot of course, technically lock him up in a prison, but we have a very fine place where we can guard him for safety, a sort of luxury guesthouse for royalty. It is called the Palazzo Santo Spirito. (playful music) Let him through. He's coming, he's coming. Respect for the Lord, Daniel, Giorgio. [Nun] Didn't you hear you silly brat? Jesus is coming. Bastard. (faces slap) (playful carnivalesque music) He's coming, he's on the stairs. Not here you fool, not here. It's mine, Jesus has no luggage. Get it out, out! Oh fuck it. (playful carnivalesque music) That's another prison. No, no, it's a lift, to take you up. Shit. (praying) (playful carniavlesque music) What's all this? We wish to welcome you, Lord. Just a welcome. (Jesus coughs) And what's the stink here? It's incense, my Lord. We use it all the time. (playful carnivalesque music) Who is that? It's a picture of you, my Lord. Stand up. (jubilant music and praying) And what's this? [Cardinal] It's another shot of you lord. [Jesus] And what's this? [Cardinal] It's St. Peter's. The biggest and greatest church in all Christianity. [Jesus] Then what's that white stuff inside? [Cardinal] That's snow. [Jesus] What is snow? (playful music) No. (people clamor) (imitates violin) (birds chirp) [Cardinal] Stay here, stay here. (birds chirp) You look like friends. We have a party up there. You can be my guests. Yes, come on. (church bells ring) Come on, friends. Don't worry. Just a moment. He runs in and out of doors all the time. We can't control him, no one can control him. We must control him, no matter what. We must have more security. Security? You'll get more, that's my specialty. Oh, thank God. (playful music) Whiskey or champagne? Whiskey. Champagne. Give the two gentlemen a glass of whiskey and a glass of champagne. Brut. Brut. (playful music) What would you like to hear? Whiskey with some music. Johnny can. Would you like to stay here with me? Would you? Yes. Of course. But why are you doing all this for us? Yes? For the sake of fun. The world was created for fun. Can you see any other reasons? No. (boys clamor) (electric guitar plays) (claps) ♪ Locked up in a palace ♪ ♪ Living the luxury life ♪ ♪ I'm locked up in a palace ♪ ♪ Living the luxury life ♪ ♪ It's better than paradise ♪ ♪ Better than paradise ♪ ♪ Like old silver marbles ♪ ♪ Shining right in your eyes ♪ ♪ Like old silver marbles ♪ ♪ Shining right into your eyes ♪ ♪ It's better than paradise ♪ ♪ It's better than paradise ♪ ♪ You drank the whiskey you dream of ♪ ♪ Makes no water, no ice ♪ ♪ You drank the whiskey you dream of ♪ ♪ Ain't no water, no ice ♪ ♪ It's better than paradise ♪ ♪ It's better than paradise ♪ ♪ He's got eat something ♪ ♪ He doesn't serve you bread and rice ♪ ♪ You eat brother, eat brother ♪ ♪ Eat until your eggs arrive ♪ ♪ It's better than paradise ♪ ♪ Better than paradise ♪ (bluesy rock music) ♪ Invite all your friends ♪ ♪ As you did in the good old days ♪ ♪ Forget Aunt Cleo ♪ ♪ Can't you see his advice ♪ ♪ It's better than paradise ♪ ♪ It's better than paradise ♪ ♪ Make love, make love ♪ ♪ Make love is better than paradise ♪ ♪ You make love, make love ♪ ♪ Make love is better than paradise ♪ ♪ It's better than paradise ♪ ♪ It's better than paradise ♪ (bluesy rock music) ♪ Prison might be great ♪ ♪ But freedom shines outside ♪ ♪ Yes, the prison might be great. ♪ ♪ But freedom shines outside ♪ ♪ It's better than paradise ♪ ♪ Better than paradise ♪ (bluesy rock music) ♪ Freedom flies, freedom flies ♪ ♪ Freedom flies, freedom flies ♪ ♪ Freedom flies, freedom flies ♪ ♪ Freedom flies, freedom flies ♪ ♪ It's better than paradise ♪ ♪ It's better than paradise ♪ (bluesy rock music) ♪ Living like flowers, like birds ♪ ♪ Like deer, like mice ♪ ♪ Living like flowers, like birds ♪ ♪ Like deer, like mice ♪ ♪ It's better than paradise ♪ ♪ So much better than paradise ♪ (bluesy rock music) ♪ It's better than paradise ♪ ♪ Better than paradise ♪ ♪ Better than paradise ♪ ♪ Better than paradise ♪ ♪ It's better than paradise ♪ ♪ It's better than paradise ♪ ♪ It's better than paradise ♪ ♪ You know it sure is nice ♪ (bluesy rock music) ♪ On the road, on the road ♪ ♪ On the road, on the road always ♪ ♪ I'm on the road, on the road ♪ ♪ On the road always ♪ ♪ It's better than paradise ♪ ♪ It's better than paradise ♪ (bluesy rock music) (breaking news alert) Good afternoon, during the last week, a strange person claiming to be Jesus Christ has spread terror in Switzerland and Germany. He walks around dressed up like Jesus and he has gained groups of followers as Jesus had, and he is acting with violence, maintaining he is Christ returned to Earth. Oh no. The impostor found his way up to quiet Copenhagen, Denmark, attacking a peaceful missionary talking to the crowd from his favorite stand. Folks, it's too late now. It's already too late. You're all condemned. (crowd boos) Oh yes. The axe is already at the root of the tree, but there is no good fruit on the tree. (crowd boos) And why, why? Because you are sinners. You are dirty, filthy sinners. Oh yes, yes you will all die. All be expunged in the next atomic war. You will all eat and choke on your own excrement. Poisoned, poisoned by plagiarism and the greed of gases. We are sinners, and what can we do? Yes, what is the first condition for getting forgiveness for your sins? (crowd jeers and laughs) Yes, yes laugh, there you are. There is a laughing sinner. Laughing sinner, jester, jerk-off. Just Jesus Christ, our Lord of mankind said, "I have not come in peace, no, I have come with a sword, "and the sword shall smite you down, right down into hell." Yes, which is here. This globe is a rotten hole. Yes, the lousiest, lowest, must ugly piece of venom imaginable in the universe. (crowd jeers) So my friends, my favorites, go for paradise. Paradise, paradise, paradise... Nobody said that. Nobody said that, the Earth is a great place. It's in the Bible, wise guy. Step down a moment, let me answer you. (crowd cheers) Here we have a lost soul. (crowd jeers) Who the hell are you? Yeah, don't tell anyone, I'm Jesus. I'm back here to tell the truth. Jesus, you're a liar and a pansy. And so? [Preacher] A pansy, and a liar. And you're an asshole. (crowd laughs) Does any one of you want an evil world? [Crowd] No! Does any one of you want evil inside you? [Crowd] No! Does any one of you know any better place than here, right here, planet Earth? [Crowd] No! Shut up. It's all lies, it's all sin, it's evil It's all in the Bible, God wrote it. A book? God's word is written everywhere. Everything under and over the sky is written by God. The universe is God's hand writing and you are God's hand writing. The truth is written inside you and outside you by every stone and animal. So what do you need a book for? It's written by the sky and by the grass, by the trees, and the oceans, by the sun, and the rain, and by the darkness, and the light. It's all God's hand writing. So please, don't be afraid of living. (crowd cheers) Don't be afraid of living! Shut up, beat it, scram, you devil. Anti-Christ. (crowd jeers) Boo, fuck off. Would you like to have a drink with me? (crowd cheers) Then why don't we go together, let's go. On your feet, come on! Yeah! Hey, let's go. Wait, wait, wait, wait, please. [Crowd] We want beer. We want beer. We want beer... He must be stopped. Tell him if he doesn't return, we'll send him back to the firing squad. Can you get him? Yes, your holiness, of course (crowd chants) [Crowd] Food for all. Food for all... (fighting and thudding) (crowd chants) (crowd screams) (batons whacking) (fighting and yelling) (Marianne panting) (Marianne panting and punching) I've been so sad. I thought you were dead. Why, you still on the run? No, they didn't get me, I escaped. I managed to get a new passport. I'm still me though, but who are you Bethlehem boy? Who's the real you? Ah come on, I'm Jesus. I'm really Jesus Christ. It doesn't matter. I'm really Jesus. They sent me here. I'm Jesus. Bethlehem boy, Bethlehem boy. I came a long way. I was condemned to death and now I've found you. (engaging rock music) (humming) (music intensifies) (humming) You are under arrest, why did you go? Didn't we have a deal? You promised to come back to us. You're spoiling everything. We did a great, great, great job. I've just been visiting Earth, sorry. If you don't come back with us now, we may have to give you back to the firing squad, and we may have to shoot her. Ah, take it easy, take it easy. Think it over. What do you think a firing squad would be able to do with me? We have a deal and I won't let you down. After all, you've been working for me 2000 years. I'll come back, but there is one condition, that everything should be like before, and all my friends should be with me, and she... All right, like before. That's good, very good. Let's go then, come on, let's go. (uptempo party music) Reverend. His holiness the Pope, is on the line. Please. This way. (uptempo party music) Yes? You did a damn good job. What? Yes, yes, thank you. (uptempo party music) What's all that noise. Oh he, he makes music when he prays. Rock and roll prayer? Oh no, stop it, stop it. [Pope] Cardinale. No, it wasn't for you, sir. Tomorrow we will meet the world together, Jesus and I, at St. Pietro. (carousing) Yes. Representatives of all the major churches of the world. They will all be invited. The world press will be there. There will be television. There will be radio. We are in the focus. (crowds cheers and chant) [Crowd] Jesus. Jesus. Jesus... (horns honks) (people clamor) (horn honks) You love me, you love me! (crowd screams and clamor) (heraldic music) (horn honks) (crowd cheers) (heraldic music) (uptempo jazz music) (religious music) And 100s of thousand have come from all over the world to witness the greatest moment ever in the history of Christianity. The Church of St. Peter's is filled, and every corner, every single inch is tense with expectation. People are weeping, praying, meditating.
