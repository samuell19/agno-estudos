Who can tell me the significance of Gregor Sampson's transformation? Billy, I really hope you're not doing a web search right now for the CliffsNotes version. Anybody? Yes. Kafka never explains why he turns into a giant bug. Aha. Kafka never explains it. That's because the explanation isn't important. Kafka intended his novella to be an allegory. It's meant to raise questions, but not answer them. It's up to you, the reader, to draw your own conclusions. Many people believe that Kafka was writing about his own life, about being shunned by his own father or being an outcast for his writing. BILLY: What do you think it means? LAURIE: Well, what do I think it means. I think it's a story about personal identity. Gregor's a regular working-class guy supporting his family, a little unhappy with his life. We've all been there, right? Then one day, he les that identity. He can no longer support his family or communicate with the outside world, and everyone that sees him is horrified by the way that he looks. In the end, he just curls up and dies to save his family from the burden of taking care of him. What I think it means is our identity, that face that we show to the outside world, is really all that we have. If you lose that identity, you're no longer human. You're a burden. You just slowly die alone. [school bell rings] And on that cheerful note, we're done. We'll pick up again on Monday with some Thomas Hardy. Should be a laugh riot. Bye. Way to go, Teach! Thank you.

Don't overthink it or you're gonna end up like that bug guy in Metamorphosis. - I don't know. - Look, one of these days, you're gonna have to just close your eyes and jump or you'll regret it.

Well, at least you're smiling on a regular basis. I finally feel like the storm is starting to break. Well, that's good enough for me. We're going to Charlie's for drinks. Come on, I'm buying. Oh, yeah! Hey. I'm Alan Cypher. You were looking for me? I'm Floyd Messner. Nice work here. Oh, thanks. How'd you find out about my work? - Came across your website. - Okay, well... were you interested in buying one of my sculptures or... Well, I was intrigued by some of your paintings, actually. Oh, painting's not really my thing, I'm actually just more of a hobbyist. Interesting, because a friend of mine tells me that you sell quite a few of them to local businesses. Who's your friend? Laurie Valentine. Really? She's never mentioned you before. I work with her at the college. Oh, well, any friend of hers is a friend of mine, especially if she's sending business my way. Not quite. You see, I saw your paintings on that site, and they reminded me of the artwork a student of mine once did. A young man named Charles Mayberry. He lived in Chicago when I taught there. So-so English major, exceptional artist. He had a lot of potential. Right up until he died in a car accident 20 years ago. You would've been, what, 10? I'm sure there must've been some kind of mistake. Look at this. No mistake. The one there on the right was printed from your site, and the one on the left was the picture taken from one of Mayberry's pieces 20 years ago. They are the same. Look, Floyd, here's the thing. See, I don't actually do that site. I have a guy that I pay to do that. I'm sure he probably came across the artwork somewhere online and dropped it in. Those web guys are con artists. Right, so you're saying this isn't your artwork. Like I told you, man, when it comes to painting, I'm really just more of a hobbyist. I'm gonna get him to take that down right away. Thank you. I appreciate it. This is the type of thing that could get me in a lot of trouble. Well, as her friend, I was concerned. She seems quite taken with you. After all she's been through, I'd hate to think she's being lied to. Well, like I said, I'm really sorry about that, sir. Just a miscommunication. I'll get that fixed right away. Anything else you wanted? No, that was it. Thanks for your time. Thank you. I'm sure we'll run into each other again soon. Sure. - [door closes, engine starts] - Good thing he wasn't a cop. - Ah, it's under control. - That's how it starts. Somebody shows up asking questions. - Back off, Manny. - Get out while you can. I'll decide when it's time for me to get out. That's what got you caught. You never know when to walk. What got me caught last time was my partner flaking out on me! You can bet I'm not gonna let that happen again! You're the boss. What's up? Mark's water got shut off a couple days ago. He was supposed to meet me here to get the bill switched over, and he never showed up after all that complaining. [sighs] I'm gonna try him again. Voicemail. Hey, Mark, this is Laurie. I'm waiting for you. Well, maybe he's on his way over. I'm sure he would pick up the phone. I'll try his work. Hi, this is Laurie Valentine. Is Mark still there? He didn't call or anything? Okay, can you have him call me if you see him? Thank you. Where is he? I'm not sure. He didn't show up for work either, apparently. Well, if you track him down, let me know. I hope he's okay. ALAN: What's wrong? [sighs] I thought you were Mark. Sorry to disappoint. No, I don't mean it like that. He suddenly disappeared. No one knows where he is, I'm really starting to get worried. Are you gonna be around later? Actually, I have dinner with clients. They wanna see my portfolio. Could be big money. Good luck. I'm sure they're gonna love you. You think? How could they not? [car door closes] [horn honks] ♪♪ [tense] [engine starts] [engine revs] [thump] What the hell? Sorry, Mark. Looks like you had a bunch of drinks, ran a few people over with your car, decided that life just wasn't worth living anymore. But don't worry 'cause I will write you one great suicide note. [car bottoms out] [crash] [explosion] [fire crackling] - [knocking] - Laurie! Laurie, open up! It's me, it's Alan, Something's wrong! Open up! - Laurie! - What happened? I was out jogging, and someone tried to run me over. Most normal people would go to the hospital after something like that! I know. I was worried about you. Me? Why? Because I saw the driver, and I'm pretty sure that it was Mark. I'd recognize that car anywhere. No. He would never-- When was the last time you saw him? A couple days. I found a camera in my bedroom. A camera? Yeah, it was hidden in a book. Well, are you sure it was him? [sighs] Who else would it be? Let me grab some bandages, get you cleaned up. Yeah. [sirens blaring] - What happened? - Didn't you get my messages? No. Floyd got hit by a car last night in the parking lot. He got hit by a car? - Is he... - No, he's alive. Some students found him this morning. They called 911. He has a couple broken bones, a concussion. I don't know. I'm gonna go see him. Do they know who did it? No. They have some cops up in the main office, looking through the security footage. They're talking to faculty and students right now. They'll probably wanna talk to you later. Okay. [thump] [engine revs] Looks like a custom ride. Not too many of those around. All right, get the security tape back to the lab, see if somebody can get us a license plate. And run the car through the system. Something should pop up. I know exactly who that is. His name's Mark Dupree. He's my ex-fiancé. Have you spoken with Mr. Dupree recently? Not in a couple days. He seem agitated to you? Something bothering him? Well, we just ended our engagement. He's not taking that well. He ever threaten violence? Did he have a specific problem with Professor Mesner? I don't think they ever even met. Well, right now I'm waiting on a warrant to proceed. We also have people out looking for him. The moment that I hear something, we'll let you know. - Thank you. - You're welcome. I'd like to speak to the other guy Dupree hit with his car. This, uh, Alan Cypher? He said that he talked to you guys last night. I can give you his cell. He's probably at work. This just doesn't sound like Mark. You'd be surprised what jealousy does to people. Detective. Yes? "I have decided to end my life." When was that sent? Last night after midnight. Anything else? "I tried to change, but I'm not strong enough. I can't imagine you with anyone else, so I took care of them. I never meant to hurt anyone, but I can't live with myself." - JANICE: Oh, my God. - Can you forward that to me? Maybe it'll be enough to get a search warrant for his home. No. I have a key to Mark's place. - It's in my car. - No, no, no. I can't go in there without a warrant. I'm just a concerned friend with a spare key. That's not illegal, right? You could just come with me. I think he's really serious. I need to check on him. All right, let's go. I'll go check on Floyd. When I'm done, I'll meet you over there. Okay. [line ringing] LAURIE: Hello? Laurie, hi. Hey, it's Alan. I just got patched up at the ER. Doctor says I'm gonna be fine. No broken bones or anything. Guess it's good I'm quick on my feet, huh? You're not the only one Mark hit with his car last night. One of the professors here at the college was run over in the parking lot. He's a friend of mine. - What? - He's in pretty rough shape, but they say he's gonna make it. Well, that's good news. It was definitely Mark. They caught the whole thing on a security camera. Listen, I'll talk to you later. Be careful, okay? If you see Mark, call the police. Right. You too. ♪♪ Mark? It's Laurie. You here? Mr. Dupree? It's Detective Valdez with the police! Please identify yourself if you're here! We need to talk to you! Mr. Dupree, please cooperate! Things will go much easier for you! Mr. Dupree? [sighs] He's not here. You know the password to that? No. Even when we were together, his computer was off-limits. He was always a little... paranoid. "Kurt Kruger." What's he doing with this? This is somebody's police record. He's a defense attorney. Probably one of his clients. Mail fraud, money laundering, multiple counts of grand larceny. This guy's a pistol. What's wrong? I know this guy. The camera you found in your bedroom was definitely feeding to that laptop through a LAN connection, wireless. So Alan was in on the break-in too? It appears so. So it was all a con? What did Mark have to do with it? Kurt Kruger has several priors, mostly cons, but there's a few violent crimes in there too. Your ex defended him a few months ago on a major domestic violence charge. Got him off on a technicality. [phone ringing] Excuse me. Hold on. [ringing continues] Valdez. Are you sure? All right, I'll be up there ASAP. LAURIE: What? What is it? Dupree's car was found about an hour ago at a crash site. A crash site? According to the lead investigator on the scene, it appears he drove straight off an embankment outside of town. Probably right after he sent you that email last night. He didn't make it. [sobs] He actually did it. I'm about to head up there now. I'll know more soon. Detective, how worried should I be about this Kurt Kruger guy? I have a 17-year-old niece that I'm responsible for. - Where's your niece now? - She's at a friend's house, but I'm having her stay there with everything going on. Do we need witness protection or something? No, no, no, I wouldn't worry about that. Now that Kruger's cover's been blown, I guarantee you he's already across state. I'll be in touch. Let's go. LAURIE: How you doing, Floyd? I may have to take a rain check on Chicago. It was Alan. He was driving the car. Alan, not Mark. You sure? [grunts] Positive. He's lying to you. I know. His real name is Kurt Kruger. He's a hardcore criminal. I'm so sorry. I knew it, I knew it! I knew this was a bad idea! Listen to me, it's time for you to get the hell outta Dodge. - This is over. - With what, Manny? The lawyer never paid me! I'm broke! What's the alternative, the state pen? No, no, if I could just-- if I could just sit her down and I could talk to her, I know that she would listen to me-- No, you can't, okay? That's exactly what happened with Miranda. Miranda loved me. She was gonna turn you in. You spent your whole life making hard choices. Here's just one more. You're right. You know what has to be done. Yeah, I do. [horses neigh] Can't afford any loose ends. Ricki? You okay? For the record, I'm not having a good summer. Yeah, you and me both. You're wrong about Alan. Oh, honey, his name's not even Alan. He tricked both of us. No, he's a good guy. He wouldn't hurt anybody. I know it. I can't-- [phone ringing] I'm gonna take this, but we need to talk. [ringing continues] Hey, Janice. No, nothing yet. How's Floyd doing? [whispers] Alan? I won't tell anyone you're here. Let me help you. [muffled screaming] [shushing] Sorry, Ricki. Thanks. As soon as I know something, you'll know something. Okay, talk soon. Ricki? Ricki, where are you? [phone ringing] - Hello? - Laurie. What did you do? Where's Ricki? She's fine for now, depending on how cooperative you're gonna be. I'm watching you. You talk to your cop friends, you twitch the wrong way, and she'll die. Horribly. Do exactly what I say. Go up to my apartment. - I'm here. - All right. There's a heating vent in the corner of the bathroom. Pry it open, pull out everything you find in there, and you bring it, then you go to your bank. I'll call you with instructions. Remember, I'm watching you. I got eyes everywhere. What about Ricki? Don't screw this one up, sunshine. VALDEZ: Miss Valentine. I didn't expect to find you here. I was just, um, tidying up. My sister, she's gonna have a major meltdown when she comes back and finds out about all of this, so I just didn't want it to be worse. I see. Actually, I have another question for you. Did Kurt Kruger ever mention a woman by the name of Miranda Bailey to you? Miranda is his old girlfriend, I think. They were having some problems. That's one way of putting it. Miranda Bailey has been missing for a few months. Two weeks ago, her body was found partially buried in the state park. She was strangled. I don't know what to say. Miss Valentine, Kurt Kruger is not just a petty criminal. He is a cold-blooded killer. Now I have men placed all around here, but you've gotta promise me that you'll be careful. Don't worry, I will. I hope so. LAURIE: I'm here. Okay. You still have Mark's checking account number? I don't think I'm on his account anymore. You are. I checked. He never took you you off. He thought the two of you were still gonna get married. So what you're gonna do is you're gonna empty it right the hell out. First his account and then yours. If anybody asks, you're just switching banks. If you tell anybody anything different, I will know, and Ricki will die. Once you get all the cash out, you're gonna bring it to me. I'll text you directions when you get back on the road. Please don't do this. If you can't be strong for yourself, Laurie, be strong for your niece. Just get this done. - Can I talk to her? - You have one hour. I'll be watching. If you're not alone, you'll never see her again. ♪♪ [tense] Hands on top of your head, Laurie! Part of me really wishes that it didn't have to end this way. I really do care about you. The dancing, the dinners. We had a couple great moments. Ahh! You bitch! Where's Ricki? Tell me! She's as good as dead! You killed her. [screams] Next time I'll aim for your leg. It might go a little higher. Who knows? She's up at the top of the trail. She's just knocked out. I didn't hurt her. For your sake, I really hope you're finally telling the truth. If he even looks like he's gonna move, shoot him again. With pleasure. [groans] Ricki! Ricki! Ricki! Ricki! I'm losing a lot of blood here. I really need you to get me some help. Stop talking. Ricki! Ricki! Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

We need to get out of here. I don't think so. Hey there, Kurt. Is that right? What, no more Alan? Oh, well. I gotta admit, Laurie. I'm a little surprised. I didn't think you had it in you. Yeah, I get that a lot. Things are looking real bad for you. You don't wanna make it worse. They're never gonna find the bodies. They didn't have any trouble finding Miranda Bailey's body. Yeah, that's right. They're gonna come looking for you. I'll take my chances. Now dig! Please don't hurt her. Please do whatever you want to me, but she's just a kid! Okay. I'll make it nice and quick. Just close your eyes and picture us dancing. - [shouts] - [gunshot] ♪♪ [tense] [screaming] [gunshot] - [sobbing] - I got you. I got you too. ♪♪ [panting] Okay, okay, you beat me. Of course I did. I'm awesome. Maybe we can race again though. Let's say tomorrow? Maybe tomorrow after we pick up your mom from the airport. Oh, that'll be loads of fun. Thank you. Looks like she's doing better. Yeah. This has been hard on her. She doesn't want me to know, but I can tell. Well, she's a tough young woman. She'll pull through. What about you? I never should've trusted Alan. He was too good to be true. So what are you gonna do? Spend the rest of your life hiding from all the good things? All the good people? I don't know. What's the other option? Living. Hey, how's it going? Me? Healing slowly, but damn happy to be alive. How about you? Getting better all the time.
