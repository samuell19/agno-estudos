Why don't you have 'Misal Pav' (Indian dish), sir? It's very good, sir. It's just that we don't have 'Sev' (Snack) and cashews. The rest is superb, sir. I'll order it, okay? Hey! - One Misal Pav, please. Sorry. What else can I say? But, Brother Firoz, we have been working here since years. And now.. - The lease taken for 99 years has now ended. That lousy landlord has given its contract.. ..to some Burger Hut guy. We'll get a job at the Burger Hut, right, sir? What are you saying? College kids work as waiters at McDonald's.. ..Pizza hut, Cafï¿½ coffee day and all these places nowadays. Young and educated. Which you aren't. Mr. Jhamshed, Montu, Babloo and Benny.. ..now you'll have to find some new job. This Burger Hut has ruined you. Now what to do? What to do know? We'll run after a job now. What else? Darling, you appear so parched today. Don't worry. I won't keep you thirsty. My sweetheart, why do you look so glum? This Babloo of yours quenches thirst. The rest is nonsense. Babloo. Babloo.

Welcome to the proud family of the Mirage Group of Hotels, Mr. Benny. This is your appointment letter. We're delighted to have you as the bell boy. You've got a job in a five star hotel. Mind blowing. You know uncle Dalmiya, don't you? I met him at the Irani hotel yesterday. - Yes. I buttered him up every day. I requested him to get me a job. - Okay. And he recommended me.

Then I'll chop off your legs first. Then your thighs. And then your.. What? - Yes. That as well. I did not mean that. Are you going to work in a ladies bar? Very indecent place, pal. - I'll not get a job anywhere. And I can't even speak broken English like you. Your family is there in.. - Darbanga. In Darbanga, your district. If your family comes to know that you work in a ladies bar.. ..they'll die of shame. But if I don't work at all, they'll die of hunger. What are you saying! He's tarnishing his parents' name. You mind it. I'm telling you. So do you want me to let my parents starve to death? "Benny the bad boy." Good day, sir. I see. What are you saying, sir? You fool. Haven't you ever seen a mirror before? How long are you going to behold yourself? Ronnie, I have worn such nice clothes for.. ..the first time in my life. What nice? It's the uniform. It's a regular thing. Yes, it might be 'legular'.. regular for you. - Yes. You are the senior bell boy, aren't you? Till now, I've seen a five star hotel only through a passing by bus. For the first time, I'll see a bus go by.. ..standing in a five star hotel. I'm very lucky. I'm so.. I'm.. Are you going to beat me up? Listen. Forget your emotion. And enjoy your promotion. Let's go. Come on. What a fitting! Why are you cribbing about the fitting? Sir, isn't this a little too long. Prakash was also tall. Prakash who? The one whose coat this is. What will Prakash wear if I wear his coat? - A shroud. What? - He is dead. He had a tumour in his brain. Listen, is there some any.. No. No, you don't have a brain to begin with. Here. Pen and.. order slip. And start work quickly. We can take care of the fitting later. This coat of a dead man? The banquet hall should be.. Negi. Manager. Hey, you, come here. Come here. - He's calling you. Nikhil, why do we need to pay him extra? I.. Good night to you, sir. - What? Good morning is.. - Shut up. What, sir? - Not to you. Just hold on for a second.

I'll get him. - Sorry, sir. And check the arrangements of the exhibition. Come on. "Benny.. Benny.. Benny, the bad boy." "Benny.. Benny.. Benny, the bad boy." "Benny.. Benny.. Benny, the bad boy." 'Welcome to hotel Mirage.' 'Welcome to hotel Mirage.' Good evening, sir. Good evening. Good evening, ma'am. - Good evening. Benny, what are you doing? Do you want to break it? Look. This.. Come on. Come on. Get the bags now. Bell boy.. - Yes, sir. Benny. Benny, what are you doing? Put it down. Put it down. Put it down. What are you doing? Hold on. Watch. This.. And this. Here. Hold it. Hold it. Come on. Excuse me? - Yes, sir. Good evening, ma'am. Welcome to our hotel. Oh, yes. Of course. This way, please. This is ma'am Sheena. The PRO of this place. Public relations officer. Does Sheena ma'am know Chinese as well? Very good. All the people who work in this hotel.. ..know Chinese, Japanese, Korean everything. Don't worry. You'll learn it very soon. I.. I can't even speak Hindi properly. I get mixed up with the masculine and feminine gender. Really? Come on. I'll teach you Chinese. Come on. Sir, you can't roam around in the passage like this. This is a five star, you know. I know. I know. What can I do? I came here to keep this tray. And this door just shut by itself. What are you doing? Get a duplicate key and open this door. Oh, God. - Good evening, sir. Good evening, ma'am. Oh, God. - Benny, what are you doing? Come on. This not a tiger. It's a door. Come on. She is the head of our housekeeping. Ria. Who was behind her? - Guest. He must have messed up something. Come, sir. Sir, over here is your bathroom, sir. And there is a very beautiful balcony outside.. ..with a very wonderful.. Oh, my God. Sir, the house-keeping will come.. ..and give you fresh towel right now. Yes, sir. Good day, sir. - Good day. Good day, sir. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Benny, good day, sir. Good day, sir. - Good day.. sir. Good day, sir. Good day. - Good day. Good day, ma'am. So? Now you learnt Chinese, didn't you? Look, mister, this is the hospitality industry. This is how it works here. The person before us can say whatever he wants. We just have to smile. Everyone does the same here. Be it if the person before us is abusing our mother in his language. But we just have to smile and say.. .."Thank you, thank you, sir. Shoot me, sir. Thank you, sir". I.. I can't believe it, Ronnie. Rs. 100, buddy. I love.. this.. hospital.. Hospitality industry. - Yes. That guest has ruined my life by calling me and again. Last night a fool had come. - Yes, pal. He made me sing the same song five times. What nonsense! I went crazy singing. I can' believe these idiots who come here. - Ladies.. Look here. This is Babloo. - Hello. He'll be working in our bar from today. Welcome. We were.. waiting for you. - Waiting for you. Hey, I'll call you Babloo, the smarty. No. My name is Babloo Charan Lathi. Really? Hey, you are Babloo? - Yes. What do you want to be when you grow up? Babloo. You wretch! You were wooing my man on the phone, weren't you? Listen, smart alec, don't vent out your frustration.. ..on me because he doesn't give you attention. Go away. - What? You wretch, a loose character of the ladies bar. So are you the bell of a temple? - And you are characterless. Look, they are fighting so badly. - This happens here everyday. You don't get into all this. Hello. - You look at yourself in the mirror. Don't spoil my mood or I'll whack you. - Yes, tell me. And I'll just stand here and smile? - You talk nonsense.. Come on, get lost. - Shut up. Look, Sisters, calm down. What did you say? Sister. Why? What happened? You naive Babloo. "Witch" "wretch", "insolent" is.. ..the local dialect here. Don't call us sister. It seems like an abuse. Witch, wretch, insolent, keep calm. "Sweetheart, oh, sweetheart, say.." "Oh, please open your heart to me." How was your first day? - Superb. Fantastic. It is not a hotel. It's heaven. I was dumbfounded when I went there for the first time. And you don't know. The boys and girls there look like movie stars. They are no less. And ladies. How they look in the TV soaps? With the dots, lipstick and stuff. All decked up. Like that. And the work there, Babloo. You just have to carry the luggage. And you don't have to carry that either. There is a roll.. Roller. - Yes. You just have to hold the roller and pull it along. Move it. Keep it in the room. Then be it Chinese, Indian. Anyone. You say to him, "Good day, sir". "Good day, ma'am". Then.. You get this tip, Babloo. The 'Pulao' (Rice Dish) is getting burnt. Take it off. Come on. Take it off. Quickly. "Sweetheart, oh, sweetheart, say something." It was your first day, right? How was it? You smart elec. Tell me. Tell me what happened. There is nothing dream-like there. There is only the reality of life. 'Benny, these guys also worship the God.' 'The only difference is that people do it early morning.' 'And these guys do it in the evenings.' "In this love of two days.." 'By 9 30 when the guests start arriving in the bar..' "In this love of two days.." Then the girls come onto the floor from the make up room. "They have started saying to me." "Ever since I have lost my heart.." "..I've got more than I bargained for." "Ever since I have lost my heart.." "..I've got more than I bargained for." "Yes, do it." "Get on, get on." "Oh, what now?" "He is admirer. His charm." Richa, don't give him attention, okay? Can't you see? It's written on his face that, "I'm a loser". He's a guest who'll only show the money and not spend it. Find someone else. My request? Go. Request. "The first love.." Roshni, your man has sent a request. "The heart's restless. The spring's here." Tell that loser to get a wad of notes out. Or else others are ready. "Ever since I have lost my heart.." "..I've got more than I bargained for." "Ever since I have lost my heart.." "..I've got more than I bargained for." What's your name? - Soni. What? - Soni. Soni, no one's like you. "Come on, come on.." Give me your number. You give me your number. I'll give you a call. For sure. Soni keeps playing the rapid fire round all the time. One day such a buzzer will go off.. ..that she'll left at home watching Sony TV. What time will you call? After I wake up at 4 00. "I also got excited and said.." "He started saying in the first meeting at night." "Come, let me adorn you with some jewelery." "Ever since I have lost my heart.." "..I've got more than I bargained for." "Ever since I have lost my heart.." "..I've got more than I bargained for." Here comes the fool. Lousy loser. Pathetic idiot. So? Bills of ten? Did you break your piggy bank today? Give me your number. Why Harry Potter? Are you a part of the dowry my father gave? No. Well, the thing is that we'll meet somewhere. We'll go to some disco and the dance as well. I don't dance with children. With children? Are you pregnant? This fool.. Come on, drink. Come on. "Just numero." Hey, listen. - Yes. Give me the number. - Sir, I don't have a mobile. You fool. Not yours. Give me the number of that girl in purple. "In the first meeting.." I don't have her number. "He started saying in the first meeting at night." "Come, let me adorn you with some jewelery." "Ever since I have lost my heart.." "..I've got more than I bargained for." Hey! - Sorry. Sir, I'll replace it. Sir, I'll replace it. What happened? Well, what do I tell you? I got nervous and spilt it. Get me another one. You're such an idiot. - Please. Hey, loser. Come here. "With you I have.." What was that fool saying? "Ever since I have lost my heart.." He was asking for your number? - You gave him, right? No. I don't have your number. I wouldn't have given him even if I had it. So will you give my number to Shah Rukh Khan (Indian actor)? Here you go. "Just numero." Well done, my little friend. - Yes. You've got the number? - Yes. Yes. "Just numero." Rs. 500. - Have fun. He gave you a Rs. 500 tip? - Good tip, isn't it? Very good, Babloo. Wonderful. Well, the result of every bad deed is good. Bad? Not like that. Now I'm your friend. That's why I'm telling you. The thing is that you've become a supplier in the form of a waiter. No. But I didn't supply any girl. Not.. Not a girl. The thing is that you supplied the number, right? That's why I said that. Very good. Rs. 500 tip. It's very good. Tell me something. How many girls work in your bar? Must be around 12-15. So many of them? - Yes. So.. if you give 10 or 15 numbers every day.. ..as in supply them.. three years down the line.. ..you'll open your own beer bar. Then people will say, "Hello, Brother Babloo. How are you?" I was only doing my duty sincerely. That's all. That's fine. Sincerity and stuff. That's okay. What? Oh, you heard that? What were you saying? - It's.. How do I say it in Hindi? It doesn't work if you spread out the blanket of honesty.. ..on the bed of dishonesty. This is what Rajnikanth (Indian actor) had said in a movie. That's why I also just said it. Okay. Good night. That Rs. 500 tip. Very good. Mr. Shahnawaaz, agreed that you live in Surat. But at times, show us your face as well. Hello. Hello. No. No. Tell me. Have you also bought off this elevator along with your customers? You've spoilt the environment of the entire building. Hey, hello. If you have bought a flat in Lokhandwala with money.. ..even I haven't bought it with iron. Okay? And what I do is my personal problem. Okay? - Personal? Public property talking about being personal? Hello. Excuse me. - Ria! Ria, stop it. Forget it. And, dear, don't take offence either. Please. Go. You're in a hurry, right? Go. Go. Sorry, dear. - Aunty, please. This is madam's car. I wonder how many people she must have ruined to get this car. And this is the managing committee of this place. They won't take any step. And why would they? Because she must be doing a complimentary show.. ..for them along with paying the maintenance. Mom, how does it matter to these girls.. ..if it's an old or a young man? Forget it, Ria. Why are you spoiling your mood? Go to work in a good mood. First you waited for the elevator. Now for the bus? You're getting late, aren't you? You want a ride, baby? Get lost, monkey face. Hey, Sheena. You are still at home? Look, what I got here. City club membership form. It's an amazing scheme. A tour package of five nights and four nights every three months. And this is even more amazing. They have recorded all their locations on this DVD. Let's watch and book it. Come. Ashu, you show up with some or the other holiday.. ..scheme every other day. But what happens? You had got one last time as well, hadn't you? We work day and night to pay for the instalments of the same. You work in the day shift, while I work in the night shift. When one of us returns, the other prepares to leave. Listen. Look.. Look, sweetheart. You'll have to make some adjustments to lead.. ..a lavish life like this. What life are you talking about, Ashu? Where is our life? Life is when you stay together. By starting a family. We have no family. We have no life. Can't you see? You've just returned. And I'm preparing to leave. But listen. At least watch the DVD before you go. Oh, no. What is this, ma'am? Can't you drive carefully? I'm sorry. - What sorry? I could've died. You have brought about an accident. Are you okay? I mean are you.. Yes. What "Are you okay"? Is this a way to drive? What is this, ma'am? You have brought about an accident, right? What if I had died? - I apologized to you. I'll take you to the hospital, right? - Brother, what happened? Brother, she would've ran me down and killed me. But you are okay, aren't you? Who are you? What it is to you? I'm Benny, the bell boy. Who are you? Mind it. Go. Move. Move. You okay? - Yes. Yes, I'm fine. Thank you. Ma'am, you did not recognize me? - No. Benny, the bell boy in Mirage Hotel. I see. Are you a new recruit? - Yes. I was heading to work. I live close by. You see this building. - In this? No. Behind this. If you go straight and then straight again.. ..there is a tenement. I live there. Come, I'll give you a ride. Thank you, ma'am. Sit in front. Not at the back. I would look like your driver if you sit at the back. What happened? Why are you laughing? No, ma'am. Well.. I was wondering.. I look like a driver even if I sit in the front. The thing is that people will feel.. ..that madam has made the driver sit beside her.. ..and is driving the car herself. Why? Why are you saying so? Just like that, ma'am. You're after all. You are like twinkle-twinkle five star. Ma'am, you should laugh your heart out like this. You look more beautiful that way. Beautiful? No. I mean the face appears brighter, ma'am. Very nice. Really? Then I must be looking really bad when at home. At home? Why, ma'am? Forget it. Tell me, how it feels working at Mirage? In Mirage, ma'am. On the first day, I jumped. I was jumping. I'm very lucky, ma'am. I must have earned some sins, virtues.. I mean virtues in my previous birth. That's why I'm working at Mirage. That guy.. that fellow at Mirage.. When I got down from ma'am Sheena's car, that Ronnie.. You should've seen Ronnie's face. It was as red as a tomato. He is nice guy. But he got jealous. Babloo, the thing is that ma'am Sheena.. ..will be offering me a ride every day. That's great. - What great? You've lost. What the.. "Don't look at the face." Don't sing the song of 1990. This is 2010. Benny, this song created quite a storm. What are you saying? What storm would be created in your ladies bar? All this happens 'legularly'.. Regularly? - Yes. Everything happens there regularly. What are you saying? "Get into my heart and see for yourself." What happened in the bar? A customer frequents our bar. Ripe oldie. Bokadia. Here's your hero. "Don't look at the face." "Get into my heart and see for yourself." "Get into my heart and see for yourself." This oldie? "Don't look at the face." Your admirer is heading for your waist. "Get into my heart and see for yourself." Isha, go tell him that this is not the age.. ..to head for someone's waist.. ..but towards the grave. "See for yourself." "The weather will change in a flash." "Even the heart of stone will melt." Today the oldie is all charged up. Today, old is gold. "Just see for yourself how effective my love is." Uncle is an absolute lover boy. "See for yourself." Someone please give Viagra to uncle. Along with the wood for the funeral. Lousy guy. "Get into my heart and see for yourself." "Get into my heart and see for yourself." Babloo, don't ever fall in love. "The weather will change in a flash." "Even the heart of stone will melt." But if you do, then don't ever back off. "Grey hair and unsure gait. - Grey hair and unsure gait." "She is now defamed. She has found an oldie." "She has found an oldie." It's not right to make fun of someone in out of tune voice. Believe me. I can clearly see love for you in Mr. Bokadia's eyes. She will not change. Babloo, you've started preaching a lot these days. Look at uncle's true love. He is almost in the grave. She can say whatever she wants to. I'm telling the truth. Babloo, that oldie can't see anything properly with his own eyes. How did you mange to see love? Because he loves you, madam. It is true love. Let that oldie be. Look, Soni, Babloo is right. So what if he is old? He doesn't just want to sleep with you like the others. Yes. The rest of the boys just want to have fun. - Exactly. Isn't it? - Yes. One night stand and all. Are you done with the preaching? Soni, you'll come across many admirers. But you won't find anyone who absolutely adores you. Yes. She will get someone. Someone who adores her. Do you know what kind of people? These pickpockets, thugs, thieves.. These goons.. They'll get people like them. How can they even think that.. ..they can actually get someone who loves them? How can you say that? Love is blind, isn't it? Look, I don't know about love and stuff. You're getting blinded by emotions. I'm dead sure. This place is not right for you, Babloo. I'll speak to ma'am Sheena and get you a job in our Mirage Hotel. Till then, pull yourself together. Don't get yourself into this job of helping them settle down. Their lives will never change. What about Mr. Mehra's four sofas and teakwood wall unit? Yes, sir. They will be delivered by this evening. "They will be delivered by this evening". If I ask you in the evening, you would say by night. Then by the next morning. Look, Salim, let me tell you something clearly. You have been appointed recently. I hate carelessness and slackness in work. Get that? - Okay, sir. Shetty. - Yes, sir. Put our bean bags and rocking chairs on display.. ..along with Raju. - Okay, sir. I have to teach them everything. Hello? Yes. Yes. Yes, it will be delivered. He is so perfect in his work. But he is so strict. And he bullies us so much. I guess his wife must not be allowing him to speak at home. That's why he vents out his frustration on us. There is no one at his home. His kids and wife were killed in an accident years ago. What? - Yes. Such is life. The one who is busy decorating others' houses day and night.. Home sweet home. He is all alone at his home. "By signalling through my eyes.." "..I will steal your heart." "By signalling through my eyes." Oh, my, my! Superb. "I'll steal.. your heart." "By signalling through my eyes.." "..I'll steal your heart." "By signalling through my eyes.." "..I'll steal your heart." "Why don't you understand me?" "Why don't you understand me?" "Why do you turn away your face and abuse me?" "Oh, Dolly." "I'm Dolly." "Darling, I am your Dolly." "I'm Dolly. I'm Dolly. I'm Dolly. I'm Dolly." "I'm Dolly. I'm Dolly." "Bingo. Bingo. Bingo. Bingo." "Bingo. Bingo. Bingo. Bingo." "Bingo. Bingo. Bingo. Bingo." "Fun and frolic, the party is fun.." "..and the styles of the beauty are amazing." "Fun and frolic, the party is fun.." "..and the styles of the beauty are amazing." "Am lost, we are lost.." "Take care of the eyes of the beauty.." "Why don't you understand me?" "Why do you turn away your face and abuse me?" "Oh, Dolly." "Darling, you are my Dolly." "Oh, Dolly. My Dolly. Oh, Dolly." "Wherever I look, all my admirers give me strange glances." "Wherever I look, my admirers give me strange glances." "Oh, beauty, listen to me, oh, beauty. Give me your heart by mistake." "Why don't you understand me?" "Why don't you understand me?" "Why do you turn away your face and abuse me?" "Oh, Dolly." "I'm Dolly." "Darling, I am your Dolly." "I'm Dolly. I'm Dolly. I'm Dolly. I'm Dolly." "I'm Dolly. I'm Dolly." Go in, Isha. Go quickly. - Come on. Come on. Hema, go in. Hurry up! Hurry up! - Come on, hurry up. Run. Preeti, hurry up. Go quickly. - Come on, hurry up. Let's go. "By signalling through my eyes." Open it. Hurry up. - Hurry up, Isha. Open it quickly. - Come on, make it fast. Come on. Come on, open it quickly. Fast. - Come on, go fast. Quick. Come on, hurry up. Close it quickly. Mr. Kamble, there is no one here. Shall we go? - Yes. Hello? I'm hiding. I'll call you later. "Why do you turn away your face and abuse me?" "Dolly. Darling, I'm your Dolly." Scoundrel, it's Sunday morning while celebrating Saturday night? It's 1 30. Do you know that? Sir.. I'm sorry.. Were you still giving customer service? - Yes, sir. Yes, sir.. How dare you break the law? Mr. Kamble, let it be. Chiku, make everyone's bill. Come on. Sir, I'll get it cleared in two minutes. Hey, Brother.. - Come on, everyone get up. Get up. Go. Brother, we are just drinking and not committing any crime. Do you have a permit to sit and drink in a bar? Why do I need a permit, Brother? Dadav, arrest him. - Come on. Come on. - Hey! Hey? What are you doing? Let go of my shirt, Brother. - Take him away. Come on, hurry up. Come on, Hema, Isha, Payal, Kalpana.. Come on, go from here quickly. Hurry up. - Let's go quickly. Get out of here quickly. Come on, girls, hurry up. Come quickly. Quickly, quickly. Hurry up, Brother. - Four Bunglows, Mahadas road. Hurry up. - You come here. Come on, hurry up. Hurry up. Benny, how will you earn here without breaking the law? It is not allowed for the girls to work here after 9 30pm. How many people enter bars before 9 30 in Mumbai? That, too, only four girls are allowed. Not only these girls, but many others.. ..earn a livelihood with the help of this ladies bar. You know, like this waiter, this Chotu, the watchman standing down.. ..the rickshaw driver, the tailor, that bangle vendor.. But who will explain it to them? We run a small bar, don't we? The police has said the bar has to shut down at 1 30.. ..and it's final. But why do these policemen harass the small bar owners? Because they can't enter the five star hotels. 'You are welcome to Hotel Mirage.' This guy over here.. - Yes, sir. He is one of our biggest clients. - Okay, sir. All the seminars, conferences of his company are held in our hotel. Right, sir. - He is a very important guest person. - Yes, sir. Good evening, sir. Sir, look at this. These are some of the known actresses of Bollywood. Their names and rates are written in alphabetical order, sir. You just point out anyone, I'll organize it. She'll be organized, sir. Well.. this one. - Oh, great choice. Great choice. Her horror film just released with her being in the third lead. She'll be organized. Hey, look. A red handkerchief! It means.. - Wow. Take service. Works for me. What about you? You are lucky. For me, I'll check out. "Feel the music." "Can you feel the music." She has mind blowing figure, right? - Yes. For your kind information, let me tell you.. ..the girl by whom you are impressed, is.. already married. She is my wife. Uh oh.. She is hot, isn't she? - No.. actually.. No? - Yes, I mean.. Married? - Yes. There she is. I see. You must be having some business. Yes. We have three showrooms of electronics in Mumbai. Then you must always be offering sales and all, right? The exchange offer schemes, right? Yes, of course. You bring your old TV and you'll get Rs. 15000 off.. ..on the MRP of our brand new plasma TV. I'm not talking about the TV.. "Feel the music." Hey, baby. Your weight has increased. Just shut up. - Idiot. Hey, sweetheart. Hey, guys, hi. Hi. - Hello, sir. Bye. - Good day. Good day. Good day, sir. Come. Hey, Ronnie. - Yes? Look, that boy who got released.. Look. He is a rich man's brat. He was bound to get released. He had just committed a small crime, Benny. - What? He just took some drugs and shot two persons. That's it. Is it a small crime? - Yes. Where do you get these drugs? Benny, are you blind? You have not seen or learned anything as yet. All the drugs are sold in that disco inside. There is less lights and music and more drugs here. Drugs are sold in our hotel? - Yes. Then why don't you inform our manager? Do you think the manager doesn't know about it? The manager knows about it? - Of course. Then why doesn't he take any action? He should inform the police. I'll tell you. Look, if no drugs are supplied here.. - Yes? Then who will come to this disco? - What? Everything is connected, Benny. They are concerned only with their profit and nothing else. Why are you so worried? You didn't eat food either. I think you have acidity. Here, have this medicine. What is it? - Medicine. Oh, I thought it is sweets, you are distributing them, right? - Okay. I'll go to sleep when I feel like it. - Yes, I know. This is the red oil. It's very cool and soothing. Apply it before you go to sleep.. ..it will give a cooling effect. Why are you in my face? Will you let me sleep? Thanks a lot. Please light the mosquito coil as well. Okay? - Yes, I'll do that. Oh, God. 'Look, the justice of our country is bizarre.' 'The people create havoc if a man cuts down a tree.' 'If you kill a dog or an animal, people create chaos.' 'But no one is bothered if a man commits a suicide.' 'No farmer will commit a suicide from today.' 'And if he does, God, forgive me. 'I'd feel that I'm failing in performing my duty.' Very good, sir. 'I, Ramesh Thakur, in a conversation with Rajnath Gaikwad..' '..the leader fighting for the rights of the farmers.' 'Drugs are no less than a dangerous spreading virus..' '..for the youth of our new generation.' 'I will try to stop it at any cost.' This madam visits my hotel. Hey, Babloo. - 'This virus is spreading all around..' That.. - '..and we are unable to do anything.' What's wrong? I'm trying to sleep and you are snoring? In fact, not even an animal can sleep here. 'The social worker Sunaina Tejwani..' '..is running a mission against this drug scandal.' 'Our channel will keep covering it all.' I hope I don't snore again. 'Aaj Tak.' Hey. What? Did you hear my snoring again? No, I heard your snoring earlier, but now I burst into laughter. You were sleeping covering yourself with a scarf. Go to sleep. Go to sleep. Oh, God. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm late. - Never mind. Actually.. I had been to the Channa Parlor. - I see. I thought, not only at night, my face should look.. ..outdated during the day, too, right? Up-to-date. - Yes, the same. Okay, tell me, will you have pizza? With four pieces or eight pieces? Slowly. Slowly, Isha. - Yes, we'll eat it slowly. I am not in a hurry today. No, I mean speak softly. Why? Is the volume of my voice very loud? Am I shouting? No, no. You are not shouting. Actually you have to shout and talk due to the loud music.. ..at the bar at night.. - Yes. Do you get that?. - That's why your tone is such. Nothing else. You are a good boy. You are explaining to me so lovingly so that I don't feel bad. You don't belong to Mumbai, right? - No, I'm from Delhi. I had a desire to become an actor since many years. So I.. Call it an itch. An itch. By the way, you look like a hero. By the way, I've been offered a Bhojpuri film. - Yes. One minute. One minute. Come on, get up. Get up. Shall I get up? - Yes. Hey? Why have you brought an egg here? So that no one casts an evil eye on you. I also find it very odd to bring an egg in my purse. But the aunty next door has made me promise.. ..to carry an egg in my purse. - Yes. Softly. Actually destiny has already cast an evil eye on me. I didn't want to take another chance. - Okay. That's why I spin it around any dear one I find. Okay. - One minute. Hey? Why are you.. spinning.. Just a sec.. The people are watching us. Please. Hey? Is it done? - Done. Shall we have pizza? - Yes. What's wrong, Benny? Normally, you talk so much that I've to switch off my radio. Why are you so quiet today? No, ma'am, actually I'm mentally disturbed since two days. Why? What's wrong? You know, one madam Tejwani comes to our hotel? Mrs. Tejwani? Yes, I know her. I saw her on TV yesterday. She was speaking strictly against drugs, ma'am. Actually.. ma'am, you don't know. A big racket of drugs is going on in our hotel. No, I'm not lying.. - I know, Benny. You know? - Yes, I do. Then, ma'am.. tell madam Tejwani and stop all this, ma'am. Ma'am, it is a very bad news for our hotel. You'll tell her, won't you, ma'am? Benny, they are something else on TV and something else in real life. You don't know anything about Mrs. Tejwani. "So you are watchin' me" Isn't he good? Look at him. - Yes. "I tell you won't make.." Are you a model? - Yes, I am. Where do you stay? - At Lokhandwala. Lokhandwala? - Yes. You can only afford to buy clothes from Lokhandwala.. ..but not stay there. But I can afford to stay in the Maharaja suite here. Would you like to attend my room tonight? Booking the Maharaja suite, taking the boys along.. ..that, too, with different names. In which name is the room booked today? Mr. and Mrs. Sunny Mittal. Wow. How do you come up with such names? Thank you so much, ma'am. Thank you. Okay, bye. - Bye. Those who use fake names themselves, how will.. ..they ever support the truth? So, Benny, if you got involved in these things.. ..you will fall in real trouble. Don't pay attention to it. Keep your eyes closed. Munna. - Yes? Where is my chilly chicken? - Yes, I'm bringing it. Munna, where is my tea? - I'll bring it. I'll bring it. Munna, bring my tea. My tea. - I'll bring it. Munna. - Yes. Don't yell. Munna, don't bring anything for me. - Munna, listen to me. Hi. Hi. - Munna, bring tea for me. Hi. - Babloo, come here. Come here. I've brought a shirt for you. - Wow. For me? Why have you brought a shirt for me? - Yes. Actually I had gone for shopping with Ranvir. - Wow. I bought a shirt for him, so I bought one for you, too. How is it? - The shirt is fantastic. But how did you remember me? Why? Can't I remember you? - Yes. Do you think I'm Aamir Khan (Indian actor) from.. ..'Ghajini' (Indian Movie)? - No, no. Babloo, you are too much. How can I forget you? You had given me Ranvir's number. - That's true. That's true. You know, Ranvir has been offered a film. That, too, with the main lead. - Wow. - Fantastic. It means he is the future Shahrukh and you are Gauri Khan. That's it. - No, no. He has been offered a Bhojpuri film. So what? - It means he is Ravi Kishen (Indian actor).. ..and you are Mrs. Kishen. Yes. - You talk nonsense. Listen. - Squander. Squander a lot. What difference does it make me? Here starts the record. Hey, Babloo. - Yes? I know such boys.. - Yes. Very well. They want a girl who is like the moon. - I see, you mean beautiful. No, my dear, by moon I mean the girl who comes at night.. ..and goes away in the morning. Hema, what's your problem? Why are you getting jealous if I am happy? - Hey? Why would I feel jealous? Am I his bed partner? And listen, I come to work here. I don't come to get into love affairs like you. Anyway, who will fall in love with you? You have become an old taxi which runs on CNG. An old taxi! Hey. What did you say, you wretch? At least I'm running, but you are flying. Madhubala, you are not a Mercedes either. - Relax. You also have to go around and return here as an old taxi here. Get lost. - I've seen many girls like you. Forget it. Leave it. - Get lost. You are always jealous. Stop saying such things. - Forget it. Come here, listen to me. Listen to me. Hema, forget it. - Hema, leave it. You are too much, Hema. Too much. Get lost, Isha's sidekick. - Shut up. Forget it, Hema. - Leave it, buddy. You all come to your senses as well. I know the standard of these boys very well. A few moments of ours are very precious for them.. ..but our life is very cheap. But they are coming here in five minutes. I've no time. And he is a VVIP. Hold on. What are Charles and Delvis doing here? Out. Out. Out. I am in a fix. I don't know what to do. Hey, psycho, you will not touch his luggage. Understand? Stay away. What are the security guards doing here? Come on, stand at the main entrance. God. Move it. Move it. I don't like your faces. Come on, go and hide inside. Come on, both of you. Is the minister's favorite suite No. 430 ready? - Yes, sir. Are his flowers ready? - Yes, sir. Smile, Venice, please. - Sorry, sir. Go and double check. Come on, move it. Yes, Nikhil. Oh, yes, everything is under control. Of course. Yes. There is no margin for error. Hey. Nikhil, I swear.. - Sir. Sir. Sir. I'll make sure it's okay.. For God's sake. What are you doing? - I'm sorry, sir. Sorry, sir. What are you doing? - Sir, I was saving you, sir. I would've gotten out of there. Do you have any problem? Sir, it is the X-ray machine, everything is exposed, sir. I'm really sorry, sir. - Oh, yes. Very intelligent. Nikhil.. 'Welcome to Hotel Mirage.' Now come on, welcome them nicely. Sir, your favorite suite 430 has been organized. What are you doing? What are you doing? - Sorry, sir. What are you doing? Why are you standing so close to me? Sorry, sir. Sorry, sir. What sorry? - Sir, they have.. They what? - They have left, sir. Who has left? - They have left, sir. Oh, my God. Now you're telling me? Welcome, sir. You are welcome to Mirage, Mr. Gaikwad. Welcome me with a hug once in a while. Your room No. 430 is absolutely ready. Enjoy the stay. Rascal. Sir.. - What's this cupcake carrying there? Hello, baby. - Good evening, sir. Good evening. And good maintenance also. The way you maintain this hotel's rooms.. ..you have maintained your mind blowing figure, too. Wow. Racal. Well, that guy.. - But.. Sir, I had requested you for a licence.. - Shut up. Sir, the licence.. - Why are you talking about the licence? Look, you do my work and I'll do yours. Got it? Yes, sir. Right, sir. - Yes. Instead of placing a pie in my hand, you're talking about the licence.. Rascal! - What? Sir, the bar is open. 24 hours a day. What do you mean by the bar is open? You're scared.. "I'll meet Rogers today. He'll give me a girl." "I'll meet.." Oh, Rogers. - Welcome. Welcome. Welcome, sir. Yes. God. - But, sir, what's this? What's wrong? - You seem very drained out, sir. Is it that easy to fool farmers? I'm exhausted after roaming with.. ..these farmers in the sun since two weeks. So you've given so much service. What service have I given? Sir, these both will give service to you. "They are the greenery and I.. - Welcome, sir. "I am the path." Wow, darling. Great. Two ladies. I love you. And what you do? Wow. Why are you staring wide-eyed at me? Do you want to sit here? Come on, sir. Madam, shift aside. Let sir sit here. No, sir. No. No? Then why are looking here? Get lost. Does he think any drama is going on here? Come on, come here. You aren't the bellboy, right? You are my bell and I'm your boy. Darling, I like you. English correct, right? Rascal. Benny, why are you surprised? Every white collared man does black business here. You know what is the tragedy of our country? There is armed Z-security appointed for corrupt men from A to Z. But I've watched on TV. This.. This Gaikwad has helped the farmers a lot. He pulls the plough with the farmers there.. ..and enjoys with the girls here. You know, the stay, food and everything.. ..is absolutely free for him here. Absolutely free of cost. Because all the illegal businesses of this hotel.. ..are concealed by his political connections. Ms. Hema, your eyes are very beautiful. They are large. I've got them for free with my face. What do you want to do? No, it is not so. Actually I've given up food and drinks ever since I saw you. You have stopped drinking, too? - Yes. If you are so broke, why do you come to the bar? "Beloved, I'll die without you. Come, oh, my life." "Beloved, I'll die without you. Come, oh, my life." What should I bring, sir? - Call that Vandana. Hey, Vandana, that guest of yours with a moustache is here. Come quickly. "I had to come, beloved. The pain of love is unbearable." Neither you receive my calls nor meet me. I've squandered thousands of rupees on you. Do you think I am a donation box? You don't meet me after arousing the desire within, you wretch. Alright. If not you, then some other girl. Not her, then someone else. Hey, who is the naughtiest amongst them? What do I know? Ask them yourself. Hey? Vandana? - Vandana, what's wrong? What's wrong? - Why are you crying? Vandana? What's wrong? Drink water. Have some water. - What's wrong? Drink water. Do you know what happened to her? - Vandana, drink water. What's wrong with her? - What happened to her? I don't know what happened. I am not.. I am not a characterless woman, Babloo. I'm the daughter of a farmer of Satara village. My father is sick. He has a hole in his heart. I've to collect a lot of money for his treatment. My neighbor told me that this is the only way.. ..through which an illiterate girl like me can earn some money. I've to give 20 % of my earnings to the person.. ..who got me hired here. I spend the rest of the money in buying medicines for my father. But still.. still I've not done anything wrong till today. I swear by Sai Baba (Indian God).. I'm not a characterless woman. We know it. They talk nonsense after getting drunk. You will have to drink the poison if you stay in a snake's burrow. It's okay, baby. I also have to hear so many taunts.. ..from my relatives and society. Since we work in a bar, everyone thinks.. ..that we go to bed with someone everyday after the hotel shuts down. Vandana, we all know who and what you are. Forget it. Yes, Roshni, you are absolutely right. You know how she is now. But only I know how this profession will affect her tomorrow. Till when will you hide yourself? One day you will be sold at Nasrullah Khan's market. By the way, tell me something. She goes home directly after the bar shuts down, right? Why are you asking? - I'll tell you. Isha, what.. What are you doing? Keep aside this dagger.. Hema, today you will have to cut a cake with this dagger. Happy birthday. - Happy birthday. Happy birthday. - Happy birthday, Hema. What are you guys mad of? I taunt you on whatever you say and today you all.. ..have come to cut my birthday cake? I talk so bitterly with you all and you.. Hema, we do have these petty quarrels.. ..but it doesn't mean that we are enemies. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to dear, Hema. Happy birthday to you. Eat less otherwise you'll become obese. My real name is Parveen. I belong to Lucknow. I was the most famous bar girl of my time. People used to squander a lot of money on me. My parents, uncle and aunty, siblings, their children.. ..everyone depended on the earnings of my dance. One day Akhilesh came there. He went crazy about me. And one day he announced in the bar that.. ..today is Hema's last night at the bar. Because he was going to marry me. I left everything and held his hand. I felt as if I've found a true lover.. ..someone who will support me all my life. I started living like a respectable wife.. ..in the flat given by him. Then one day I learnt that.. Akhilesh is already married. He had two children. One day his wife came to my flat.. ..and threw me out like a dog while I was bare feet. Akhilesh went out of India, but I was bearing his child. I felt embarrassed and returned back to my parents.. ..whom I had brought up for years. But even they were unable to put up with my infamy.. ..and the news of my illegitimate child. I had to return to the same bar.. ..from which I had left with Akhilesh once. I've a 12 year-old-child. I'm maintaining the cost of his boarding.. with great difficulty. I don't want anyone else to go through.. ..what I had to. You don't know, when a young girl becomes old.. ..no one even gives her a glance. Now my child doesn't have anyone except me. No, Hema, you stay the same. Say bitter things to everyone. - No, Isha, I am.. Hema, how can you say that you don't have anyone? That your child doesn't have anyone except you? Shall I say something? Your child won't get so many aunties in any bumper sale as well. Right? - Yes. Yes. And this Soni is also a part of your family from today. My real name is Aakruti. Yes. And my name is not Isha, it is Sarita. Vandana. My real name is Niranjana. And my real name is not Roshni, but Anjali. Pedora. Real name is Marina. Babloo. And the real name is also Babloo. "By signalling through my eyes.." "..I'll steal your heart." "By signalling through my eyes.." "..I'll steal your heart." "Why don't you understand me?" "Why don't you understand me?" "Why do you turn away your face and abuse me?" "Oh, Dolly." "I'm Dolly." "Darling, I am your Dolly." "I'm Dolly. I'm Dolly. I'm Dolly. I'm Dolly." "I'm Dolly. I'm Dolly." "Why don't you understand me?" "Why do you turn away your face and abuse me?" "Oh, Dolly." "Darling, you are my Dolly." "Oh, Dolly. My Dolly. Oh, Dolly." We know each other so well now. Why are you shying away then? I'll quench your thirst. Oh, God. - What happened? What? What? - Nothing. Nothing? Nothing happened? - No, nothing happened. Then why did you barge in like that? - Just like that. Nothing, just like that. But a lot happened at our place. Take this. Eat this. Eat this. - What's this? It was Hema's birthday and we all celebrated it a lot. Do you know? Everyone there is illiterate.. ..but everyone has a degree in giving love. Oh, that's true. But.. the degree of love they give.. ..is a problem. Working at a wrong place doesn't mean that.. ..they are wrong as well. You used to say, "See again and again.. Babloo's ladies bar". I did take a look. I watched all the girls closely. I've understood their lives and their circumstances. Benny, I've felt that their acceptance is.. ..their helplessness. You talk too much. No one asks money from anyone forcibly over there. Everyone gives them money on their own. Working there is not bad.. but the filth in people's mind is bad. Actually, I was just.. You.. you get angry very fast. Let go.. - Come here. Sit here. How can you talk like this? I apologize to you from the bottom of my heart. Okay? Will you have tea? - I'll eat glucose biscuits, too. You ask for a lot more than what is offered to you Brother Babloo. Don't misunderstand them. - Okay. Eat this.. Eat this. "Why don't you get the destination of happiness?" "On every step there is.." - Hey, Sheena. Look at this. We can own a holiday home in Kajrat only in 36 installments. "On every step, there's pain.." - Listen, only 36 installments! "Why is it like this?" "Why is this city so isolated?" "Why is this city so isolated?" What's the matter, ma'am? You look very sad and sullen today. Nothing. - I am sure there's something. Tell me. Stop it. Who are you to ask me? - Benny, the.. Sorry, ma'am.. - Benny.. Yes, ma'am. I am sorry. I am really sorry. Actually, these days, I have so many problems that.. Problems? Ma'am, what problems can rich people like you have? There's a major problem of our class. We never get satisfied. We have a lot.. ..but in the greed of getting all these.. ..we end up paying loans all our lives. We keep giving EMIs. My husband, Abhishek, is a severe patient of this disease. Benny, do you know what's the toughest? In spite of so many problems, I always have to keep a smile.. ..on my face in my job. Just like a bar girl standing at a ladies bar. Look, I know that I am going for 20 days. I've an outdoor shooting in Ooty. What's the name of the movie? 'Bhaujai Ki Saugand, Tohara Ke Gaad Ke Rakhdaye'. Are you telling me the movie's name or its story? You talk so sweetly when angry. Oh, God, I am getting late. The production guy is waiting for me. Production? - Yes. Okay, I'll leave. Won't you ward off the evil eye with an egg? - Yes. Enough.. Done. Take this. - Hey, why this? Keep it. It will be of use to you. Look, Veer, if you have money, people will be around you. Improve your standard. - But, Isha.. Come on. You are getting late, aren't you? Production.. Listen.. don't say 'bye.' And yes, don't look back either. The thing is that I can't handle emotions. Take care of yourself. Okay? Bye. "Separation.. I hope no one ever separates." "Separation.. Oh, God, I hope no one ever separates." What's the matter? Why are you sullen? Separation. Look, Ranvir has gone to Ooty.. ..so rule over the world now. Call him. Shall I? - Yes.. But he must be busy. - Well.. - He'll get angry on me. He'll feel happy if you call. Call him. Open my hands once, Ganga Thakur.. ..I'll break your head. I swear on my sister-in-law. 'Hey, Brother.. answer the call.' Cut. Cut. - 'I am not giving you a missed call.' Whose phone is ringing? - Sir.. Sir, my phone is ringing. 'Answer the call. I am calling you. Hey, Brother.' What kind of a ring tone is this? 'Did you get it?' - My pressure is going up after hearing this. 'Pick up the call, Brother.' - Hello. Sir, press the green button first. - Okay. Hello? Hello? Talk to him. - Yes. Hello? "Separation." - How are you? I was missing you a lot. The song "Separation" is being played.. so.. Hello, Isha, I am on my shoot. Shall I talk to you later? I told Babloo.. but he.. - Let me speak. Hello, Mr. Ranvir.. This is Babloo. How's the shooting going on? Look, Babloo, listen to me carefully. The sad songs will go on there and Isha will keep missing me. If you called again.. I'll kill the villain here later.. ..but I'll kill you first by coming to Mumbai. Is that clear? Sir, it's done. - "Oh, beloved." Why did you disconnect the phone? What did he say? He threatened to kill me. - Kill you? No, the villain.. in the shooting. - "Oh, beloved." Shall I call him again? I am missing him a lot. No, it's better if we change the song instead. Pinky, change the song. Shall I sing, "I can't live without you?" Come on, let's go inside and talk. Come here. Good evening, sir. Is everything fine? Would you like something else? - I want you. How dare you talk to me like that! Don't think of this as complementary like.. ..your fruits and chocolates. I'll pay for it. Rs. 1 lakh. - Stop it, sir. By giving Rs. 1 lakh do you think that I'll sleep.. - Rs. 2 lakhs. My hard work and your time. I am not that type of a girl. Nothing like that can happen between us. - It can happen between us.. because you're just as.. ..beautiful as rich I am. This is Rs. 3 lakhs. Before refusing them.. ..think what all you can do with this money. You can buy a new car, I-pods, jewelry, new wardrobe.. ..you can buy your dreams. Hey, hello. Who's parked this car in my parking area? It belongs to Ms. Ria living in room no. 401. She's ordered a new car from the showroom today itself. New car or a new adventure? Sir, your luggage? - 'Beautiful shot.' Interesting match, sir. 'Went off his pads. Just outside. Ramiz Raja..' Oh, God. Sorry, sir. Sir. What a six, sir! Sir? - 'A sneak shot, but..' Remote here, sir. Okay? Sir? 'Every shot from the Pakistanis..' Sir? Oh, God.. Hey, Benny.. what happened, man? I touched. He fall.. Doctor? - No way. He's dead. He's dead? - Yes. I know he's dead. Come on, doctor. You know what to do with the dead body. - Yes. As always, take him to your nursing home. And declare him dead there. - Okay. After that we'll inform his family. - Okay. Come on, move. Idiot. Neeta.. - Yes, sir. Arrange for a house keeping trolley. - Right, sir. What's the room number? - Sir, 309. Nikhil, what's the outstanding of room No. 309? Rs. 70000 sir.. - Rs. 70000? Are you crazy? No, sir. - Where are you right now? In the reception, sir. - You just wait there, I am coming. I am coming right away. What are you staring at? What? What? - Nothing, sir. Then move, Benny. Come on. - Yes, sir. Butt, what, sir? - It is this. This, this is your behind. Got it? Yes, sir. - Move. Nikhil, did he have to die in our hotel? Ronnie, let go.. - How strange! There's a death in our hotel. Inform the police. Police? Are you out of your mind? Police means media. Media means public. Public means our customers. Look, if they learn that a death has taken place here.. ..they won't come here. Then both of us will have to go look for a job together. You do one thing. Fold his luggage, I'll fold him by then. 'Sir, your favorite suite 309 is ready.' 'Your favorite flowers. Your favorite dark chocolates.' 'Nikhil, did he have to die in our hotel?' 'How strange!' Benny.. Benny, pose for a photograph. Benny, look there.. Look there. She's totally changed. Who is it? - It's Ria. Rs. 3 lakhs, Ria? Wow. That, too, in one hour. - What? It is faster than taking out money from the ATM. - Right. If you come for the duty.. then people touch.. ..you here and there for free. So why not get paid for it? If I have car today.. I'll also get a boyfriend who owns a car. If you travel in a bus, you'll get a boyfriend.. ..who owns a bike at the most. 'Hi, handsome.' 'Do you want to be friends with me?' 'Hi, I am Jennifer.' 'Welcome to Hotel Mirage.' You.. - Mumbai police. Special branch. This has been going on in your hotel a lot. This prostitution in pretext of escort service. Tomorrow when it is published in the newspapers.. ..you'll get to know everything. Sir, these are regular guests of our hotel. Sir, and then he's a very respectable businessman. Sir, what do we know what he does inside the hotel room? We have no idea, sir. Is it a 5 star hotel or an inn near the check post? Will you do anything here? Sir, this is the matter of our hotel's reputation. Sir, anyway, this is a very minor issue. We can sort it out.. over.. over a cup of coffee, sir. If you want, you can have tea as well, sir. The one with less water. Ronnie, what's so urgent? You come, I'll show you. Where is the other party? Benny, come with me. Benny, come on. - They've handcuffed school girls. They are not school girls, they are teachers. The principal is inside. Come on. How are you, sir? Good evening, sir. Good evening, sir. - What are they doing in the bathtub? I'll tell you later, first help them out. Help them first. Sir, you please come. Come, sir. Sir, it is a police matter. - What police matter? Come on. Benny, what's wrong with you? - Nothing. Tell me, what's the matter? Will this hotel shut down? - No. Why? There was a police raid yesterday. Forget it. This has not happened for the first time. You come with me. Don't worry. You see, there'll be nothing in the papers about this tomorrow either. Ronnie, it looks like a red light area. So what? This is a five star hotel. You get permission to do all this here. And listen, don't call it a red light area, it doesn't sound good. Call it escort service. If you call these girls.. in Hindi.. - No, I understood. It doesn't sound good, does it? Escort service sounds good. If somebody calls you a boy who rings a bell.. it won't sound good, will it? Bellboy sounds really good, doesn't it? Right? Let's go. And listen.. this is a five star. The more filth, the more stars you get here. What happened? Did you like the joke? - No.. that one.. Which one? - "The boy who rings a bell".. Did you like it so much? - Yes. Come on. Benny. Benny. - What? What's written here? A renowned hotel was raided. Benny, I hope this is not your hotel? - Five star? Have they published the name of the hotel? No, there's no name. - Your brain is like a ladies bar. How can you accuse like this? No, I just asked you. Babloo, this is a five star. It is not your.. bar. Give that to me.. - Why? I need to clean the mirror. Give that to me. You'll clean the mirror with today's paper. Is this a mirror? - I had come to dry this.. five star here.. ..sorry, towel. - Hurry up. It's time for Ranvir's film. Everyone must be waiting. I was trying to see the show's timing. What's the name of the movie? 'Bhaujai Ki Saugand, Tohara Ke Gaad Ke Rakhdaye.' I am not asking the dialogue, tell me the name. You tell me the movie's name. Tell me. 'Bhaujai Ki Saugand.' You read the rest on the poster. Hurry up. Yes. Sorry. Sorry. I got late. Hema.. what are you doing? Our hero is here. - What an entry! 'Thakur, I've come back from the city to retaliate.' 'I'll not spare you now.' "Till when will you torment me like this?" "Be sure of that." He's dancing so well. - Sit. "Be sure of that." 'I swear on my sister-in-law, I'll not spare you.' Hit him.. - He's looking so handsome. What a dialogue delivery it was! Look. He's come again with a stick in his hand. He's looking so handsome. Just like a hero. Great. Shut up. This is not your father's house. Is this your mother's house? Mind it. Sit down. 'Thakur, your time is up today.' 'Forgive me. - Today, I'll count your sins.' 'No, you are like my sister-in-law. Please forgive me.' 'Please, forgive me.' Yes, I told you.. I am ready.. But.. But I want Rs. 3 lakhs. You have an expensive entry fee. Okay, I'll give you Rs. 3 lakhs. Okay, so I'll come tonight itself. You just tell me when and where to come. You will give me Rs. 3 lakhs, won't you? Rs. 3 lakhs for one night? Won't do. I'll take you to Lonavala for three nights. I'll give you Rs. 1 lakh after every night. Down payment. Tell me, do you agree with it? Yes, yes.. I am ready. I'll be there. I thought you were different from the others. But I saw as well as heard you today. You are really different from the others. You are doing all this stealthily? Got a call from the village. father is in the ICU. If he doesn't get operated in one week.. then.. I need Rs. 3 lakhs. Rs. 3 lakhs. I can do anything for mother and father. "My dreams are so cheap, is there someone who can buy them?" "Anyone can buy it." "The path is lost, the destination is too far." "What is my destiny like?" "What is my destiny like?" "Oh, God, who cursed me?" "Oh, God, even prayers don't help." "Oh, God, who cursed me?" "Oh, God, even prayers don't help." I had kept this Rs. 10000 with the manager as savings. Use them for your work. And try saving yourself as much as possible.. ..but don't choose this way. No, Babloo, I think even the Lord wants the same. No. Hey, Pedora, what are you doing? Brother, don't stop me today. I've earned a lot for your Ghungroo ladies bar. Please. If Babloo can help her.. can't we help her as well? Hi, baby. Just a reminder for tomorrow. - Of course. How can I forget? Candle light dinner, fixed. Bye, love, take care. - Bye. Who's this? - Boyfriend. What? You got a new boyfriend? - Yes. He owns a bike? - No. He owns a car. Yes. I brought you here to show you the surprise. This is 'Tera' (Yours)? - We are on floor number 'Tera' (Thirteen). Not the number. - Then? - Does this belong to you? No, this is our flat. 2 BHK flat. But on rent. Actually I've spoken to my parents. They want me to settle down at the earliest. So this is my surprise number 2. Wow. I can't marry you.. - What? But why? You know why I am working in this ladies bar, right? No matter what happens in my life.. ..I want to educate my siblings. I want to bear all their expenses. Come on, Isha, don't your siblings mean anything to me? You don't get tensed. I'm there. I'll manage everything. Every month's expense is more than Rs. 50000. You'll manage in the beginning.. ..but you'll feel it is a burden later on. So what do you want? You want to stay in that muck.. ..that filthy place, in that dirt, between those bad people.. ..and ruin your whole life? Nowadays, I can see my brother Dheeraj's monthly fees.. ..in all those dirty looks. I can see my sister Laado's college degree. My little brother and sisters.. Akash, Rinku, and Preeti.. I see their tuition fees. But do you know how much my parents are forcing me to get married? You get married then. You get married . If not me, somebody else will become Mrs. Ravi Kishen. What rubbish? What are you saying? - I can't marry you. But, yes. I want something from you. Will you give it to me? What do you want? Tell me? - This. What will you do with this nuptial chain? I'll see this daily and show it to others, too. That there was one guy who wanted to spend not one night.. ..but his whole life with me. You refused Ranvir for marriage? Pedora, you know.. we have so many responsibilities.. ..in our lives that we can't think of ourselves. Our siblings should become something. That's it. We don't want anything else. And anyway.. I like dreaming for others. I am happy that Ranvir's dream is coming true. Shall I tell you something? The first time I came here.. ..I was feeling so ashamed.. that what a place I'm working at! Which kind of girls am I working with? But after meeting you.. I can tell you one thing for sure. That the way you are struggling in your life.. ..in such an environment, I am proud of you all. "You are not in your senses. Your youth is intoxicating." "It's not.. It's not your fault." "You are always intoxicating." "You are a damsel." - Come and dance. Not on the stage. Not on the stage. Sit here. - Hey, little friend.. You all have a seat. Calm down. Sit comfortably. The singers are singing here. You just listen to their songs quietly. They are sitting quietly. - Make them sit quietly. Otherwise, I'll teach them a lesson. "Lover is your name." "Your job is to steal hearts." "Hold my hands." "You are defamed here." Come on, sir. Have a seat. Come on. "You are a damsel." "You are a damsel." Don't let go off her hand. - Let go off me. You shouldn't touch her. - You tell me, what do I touch? Sir, dancing isn't allowed here. Sit. Why are you messing with me for these characterless women? Hit him. Hit that rascal. What did you say? - Characterless women.. How dare you say that? How dare you? Who did you call as characterless women? Babloo. You come with me. - You don't know us. Take them inside. Come on. Throw them out, come on. Let go off me. Let go. You rascal, come inside. We'll surely teach you a lesson. I will take care.. - Your friends outside.. Come on, move. - Let go off me. Let go off me. - Suresh, close the door first. Close the door. I'll thrash them. How dare they bash up our boys? Do they have a license to thrash anyone who commits a mistake? The people working in some crummy Ghungroo bar.. ..located on Goregaon link road.. ..bashed up our boys? Beaten them up like dogs! You'll give a statement to the police that.. ..you all had been to the bar.. ..but you didn't even touch the bar girls. But even after the 9 30 deadline, when the bargirls were getting.. ..physical with the guests publicly.. you four tried to capture.. ..their illegal activities on your cell phone camera. That's it. They all started beating you up brutally after that. I haven't seen you before. Who are you? I am Alok's friend. I've recently shifted here with my parents. Oh, your mother must be worried hearing all this, right? Ask her to relax. - Okay, ma'am. And also tell her that you won't be able to come home tonight. Why are you standing sullen? Jail is a common thing. It has been happening since the freedom fights era. These days, everything is 'legular'.. leg.. - Regular. Yes, it is regular. Even actors come to jail nowadays. Stop lecturing me now. - No, I am not lecturing you. I am happy and feeling proud. I am celebrating. You are actually a ladies bar waiter now. You've completed the formality of going to jail after being in a brawl. Babloo, you've finished your graduation now. Babloo has passed. I want to tell this news to everyone. Sir.. Brother, please come here for a minute. - What is it? This is Babloo. He works in the ladies bar. Today he finished graduation.. - So, what do I do? Sir.. this is Babloo. He works in a ladies bar. There's a filthy and third class bar named Ghungroo ladies bar. He works in that bar. Today, he landed up in jail after having a fight. He completed his graduation today. Shake hands with him. Shake hands. Mr. Raju is the manager of Ghungroo ladies bar. Oh, God.. - This is Benny, isn't it? Take it easy. Sir.. - Going to jail is common in our line. This is a daily job for us. You do one thing, meet me in the evening. I'll finish the paper work and return. - Okay, goodbye. You said what I wanted to say.. He said it was 'legular'.. legu.. - Regular. It was regular here. Very good. I am very happy. My mind is at peace now. Our NGO team has known the inside story of these ladies bars of Mumbai. The law is being broken. They dance all night and they find new ways to attract the customers. Have some. Please. Till when will we pretend to be ignorant though we know everything? They are exposing themselves in public. Gentlemen, now it is time. We all have to get together and expose this.. ..dirty network of the ladies bars. Yes, gentlemen. She's right. I mean, this vulgarity, this obscenity, this exposure.. We won't tolerate it more. You have a high position in the society. I am sure if you all get together and protest.. ..people will get awareness.. I am sure.. Thank you, Mr. Negi. Mrs. Tejwani, shall I assume that the party is confirmed? Of course, Mr. Negi. A thousand covers? - Yes. Yes, alright. Enjoy yourself. - Thank you. Nikhil, the party is confirmed on 15th.. So we have to get together. I want all the ladies bars to shut down as soon as possible. And give the report to me. If you need any help, take it from our department. Shut it down as soon as possible. This is not good for our society. You don't know who I am. If I make one call, they'll come and kill you. Rascal. Stop your melodrama. Scoundrel, I don't want the ladies bars. Come on. Come on. Don't push. - Sit there. Sit, sit. Move the vehicle. Come on, move. Come on. Come on. Get everyone. Get everyone. Come on. Get everyone. Go and sit in the car. Don't act smart. Come on. - Come on. Hurry up. Come on. - Come on. Come on. Wretch woman was hiding inside. Come on. What happened, Brother? - What happened? What happened inside? - There is nothing to worry about. Everything has been settled. You all will be able to go home in an hour. Thank you, Brother. Thank you, Brother. - Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for what? - Good. I charge you guys 40 % protection money to resolve such issues. Come on, relax now. I will go and settle other things. - Okay. Okay. - Thank you. It's so.. - It has become a daily thing now. They take money and yet come to arrest us. Then they make us wait for 5 hours here. Come on, sit over here. They said 1 hour, but I wonder how long they will take. Rascals. Brother.. Why is that girl here? Who, she? I caught her backless on the backseat at Lokhandwala back road. What are you saying? - She was busy with a guy. The guy ran away. I caught her. Hey, hi-fi, what were you saying the other day? "Public property talking of being personal". Now look, who has become public property. How much? Brother. The girl there.. Her.. Anyhow get her out of here. Please, Brother. I'll pay whatever it takes to get her out. Please, Brother. - You guys.. Please. Please. - Okay, I'll do something. Come on. Oh, thank you, Brother. I'll talk to him. You go and sit there. Sir.. - Ria. What I am saying is.. - Yes, tell me. The girl sitting back there.. Aunty.. I have called her here. Actually, our ladies bar was raided today and.. I got caught. And these guys said that they will leave me only.. ..when I call two people who can vouch for me. Aunty, I don't know anyone other than you two. Why, dear? Why do you do such a thing? Stop doing it. Look at my daughter Ria. You can also work at a nice place like she does. Your job is done. He is Mr. Raju. Our ladies bar's manager. He will handle the rest of the things. You both can leave now. Right? Thanks. Thank you for coming. Thank you, Ria, for coming. Okay, listen, is this girl from another bar? No. She's from another world. But her state is just like mine. Same to same. Tell me, Ria. What did you want to talk to me about? Akash, let's get married. All of a sudden? But.. we had decided to get married two years later, right? I want to get married now. Do you have a problem with it? I have no problem with it. I love you a lot. Let something that was supposed to happen 2 years later, happen now. Babloo, have you vowed not to talk today? You are not talking to Gulabo. Do I need to talk to plants everyday? It's not necessary, but you don't need to get angry. Aren't you going to get up? Don't you have to go to work? I have no work to go to. What do you mean? - Police cancelled Ghungroo Ladies Bar's licence. What are you saying, Babloo? Mr. Raju says that he will bribe them and get it started. But there is no guarantee as to by when. So what will you do now? Let's see. I'll look for a job at a railway canteen.. ..or a roadside restaurant. What else? What nonsense you are talking, Babloo? Who am I? A five star is standing in front of you. I mean a friend working in a five star hotel.. ..is standing in front of you. Got it? Talking nonsense. When will you take advantage of such a friend if not now? I will get you a job. Get you one. Sir, good man, good boy. - Shut up. What are you doing over here? Sir, madam Sheena recommended Babloo. Just hold on for a second. - Where is Babloo? Babloo is behind.. Down there, sir. Oh, he is Babloo? Have you worked anywhere else before? Yes, listen. - Ghungroo Ladies Bar, sir. Just hold on for a second. What did you say just now? What 'Ghun'? What? Ghungroo Ladies Bar. Ghungroo Ladies Bar? - Yes. Benny, do you have any brains? He does, sir. Sir, he is very intelligent. Very.. I am talking about you, not him. Benny, do you have any brains? - What? Yes, I do, sir. No, you don't. You don't have any brains. If you had any brains, you wouldn't.. ..have brought this boy who works at Ghungroo bar.. ..here in The Mirage. Look at this. He is a down-market, third-class guy.. ..who works at Ghungroo Ladies Bar. And look at us. The elite, the most sophisticated.. ..the cream of the society. - Thank you, sir. I mean.. If you bring him here henceforth.. ..I will hand him over to the police. Sir, he's my friend. - Shut up. I.. I.. - And you will lose your job. Sir. - Get out. - Sir. Not from there. - Sir. Backdoor. From the backdoor. - Let's go. Let's go. If anyone sees him here.. - Sir. They will say that illicit activities are going on here. Illicit activities are going on here. - Sir. Nikhil, I am still on the line. "I'll get you a job". Let's go. - Babloo. Listen. - You don't have to say sorry. I am going through a bad phase. It happens. It's not that. The backdoor is on that side. What door? - The backdoor is on that side. Let's go. Brother, look at the state of this bar. If you want, this bar can start again. I have spoken to the senior inspector. He can get it started. Actually he is a philanderer. Whenever he gets into the mood, send girls from here. So that your as well as his work gets done. Kamble, I can do illicit business.. ..but I can't work as a pimp like you guys. These girls used to sell their art at the dance bar and make a living. You stopped that and forced them to sell their body. Now they stand here quietly and make a living. You guys want to stop that as well? So that they stand on the streets? You guys want to make them do what they don't want to do. No matter how much you guys try to stop their work.. ..if God wants them to make a living.. ..then this orchestra bar will surely start. What is this, Ria? You are nervous? Just relax. My mom and dad are very chilled out. You will be very pleased to meet them. Please come here. Have a seat. Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad. This is Ria. 'The moment I saw you, I have been living the same fantasy.' Have a seat, dear. Son, you have got a fantastic choice. Your choice is my choice. 'I want you. - What?' What will you have, dear? Nothing, thanks. - No, you will have to take something. 'Rs. 1 lakh.' 'Rs. 2 lakhs.' Rs. 3 lakhs. Okay, dear, tell me, what are your plans after marriage? You are going to stay independent or with us? Well, I will prefer you stay with us. 'Ria, my business associates are Vishal and Sandeep.' 'If you don't mind, just like me..' Excuse me. I'll just go to the washroom and come back. Madam.. Madam, your car keys. "There are countless desires in the heart." "There are countless desires in the heart." "Why does.." "Why does desolation surprise one?" "Why is the heart troubled?" That's Ria, right? - Yes, ma'am. What are you doing, ma'am? - Ria. No. Please. Please. - Ria, what are you doing? What are you doing, Ria? What happened? Ria. Ria, stop it. Ria. What happened? What is it, Ria? "Why is this city deserted?" "Why is this city deserted?" "Why is everyone.." "Why is everyone upset?" Let it be, Mr. Kuldeep. It was my mistake. Okay, will you take me for lunch today? Lunch? You will have to join me for dinner. And a long drive after that. And if I feel like, then straight-drive, cover-drive. I will play all the shots. Tell me if you are okay with it. - Okay. Mr. Champak, do something. I need money desperately. Tell me if you can meet me at my flat in Dahisar. I will give you the money. Police won't let the ladies bar run so easily. What they will do won't just make it impossible for you to make money.. ..it will also be difficult for you manage your conveyance. By the way, a lot of girls are going to Dubai. Tell me if you are interested. I'll make arrangements for you. But how can I leave my kids and go, sir? Go for your kids, Hema. You know you have only 2-3 years more in this profession. Make as much money as you can. Go there and dance. Please private clients. There is no other option than that. "You don't get happiness in life at your request." "Who snatched the smile away from my face?" "God, who cursed me?" "God, prayers aren't working." "God, who cursed me?" "God, prayers aren't working." "There is no peace of mind even for a moment." What is it, dear? What happened? Mom, I was thinking what circumstances do to people. One storm ruined our life. 26th July. Dad got stuck in the car all night long. Now he is paralyzed. He is on a wheel chair. Dad stopped walking and our life came to a standstill, Mom. Mom, I had to discontinue my studies. I could've been something else. I tried so hard. I didn't get a job elsewhere. But now.. another storm. Why us, Mom? Don't worry. - Why me, Mommy? Hello. - Hello, Isha. Any news about when the bar is reopening? No, Soni. No news. I am facing financial crises. I don't know. My father asks for money everyday. From where should I get the money? Okay. - Okay, fine. Yes. "Why do you look at the face?" "Try falling in love with me." "Try falling in love with me." "Things will change in no time." "Stonehearted ones will also give in." "Look how powerful my love is." "Look how powerful it is." "Why do you look at the face?" Father.. - "Try falling in love with me." - Go, dear. Go. Go and meet him. There is no harm is seeing him. But keep one thing in mind. Don't fall in love with him. You can shop and give him the bill. Dear, you are not destined for love and marriage. Why do you think about it? Yes? Go. - Father, I was having difficulty deciding since a long time.. ..as to what is worse, my destiny or my father. This is The Mirage's project file, Mr. Waghmare. If you give clearance, there will be one Mirage in Goa, too. Sweets for you. Let it be, Negi. These sweets have made us diabetic. This time we don't want sweets, we want cream. What say, Narayan? Yes, I have heard a lot about your hotel. - Yes. How about if we get to enjoy some, too? - Yes. This time, to clear the file, we need a party.. ..where there is good whiskey. - Yes. And great.. girls. This is very wrong, sir. He's my friend, sir. How can I tell a friend to do such a thing, sir? Just hold on for a second. - Sir, that.. He is your friend, right? - Sir. Can't one friend do this much to save his friend's job? Sir, he's a dear friend. I.. Sir.. - I know. I know. My job is.. - At risk. No personal vendetta. Look, I have to please my seniors. Like in this case you will have to please me. Your friend will have to please you. We have to see each other, you know. It's.. It's like give and take, you know. Listen, if this job is done, I will give.. ..your friend a nice job in this hotel. And if not, then you will lose your job. Yes, Nikhil, tell me. Yes. Yes. Tell us, Babloo. What is it? Tell us, what is it? Why aren't you saying anything? Come on, man. Tell us. Speak up. Hey.. Benny's seniors are going to have a party in Lonavala. They need dancers. To sing and dance. They will pay well. Good, isn't it? - Look, whatever I.. Forgive me if you have felt bad. Stupid, why are you apologizing? You have brought us a source to make some money. But I don't know what kind of a place it is.. ..and what kind of people they are. It's an unknown place. It's obvious to get scared. We can't sit idle either. We have to run our households as well. Yes, Isha. You are right. Babloo, why worry about us? First destiny made us work in a bar.. ..and now the government forced us to the streets. You are right, Soni. Now we are being forced to do what we didn't want to do. "..without you, without baby just can't go" "Without baby, I just can't go" "I am wearing bangles and earrings." "Give me a high-five." "Give me a high-five." "I am beautiful and agile." "Give me a high-five." "Give me a high-five." "I am wearing bangles and earrings." "Give me a high-five." "Give me a high-five." "I am beautiful and agile." "Give me a high-five." "Give me a high-five." "Don't stare at me." "My skirt is colorful." "My skirt is colorful." "I daily pray for your wellbeing." "I don't pray for anything else." "I should die at your feet." "I don't pray for anything else." "I left my house all decked up." "People go crazy looking at my gait." "I left my house all decked up." "People go crazy looking at my gait." "They go crazy over my hair." "They go crazy about the way I move." "They go crazy over my hair." "They go crazy about the way I move." "Don't stare at me." "My skirt is colorful." "My skirt is colorful." Back off, fatso. Back off. Drink a little. - Babloo. Babloo. - Babloo. Babloo. - Babloo. Babloo. - No. Babloo. Babloo. Sir. Sir. Please, sir. What are you doing, sir? No, sir. No. Enough. It is not whisky or anything. They are scoundrels. Let's go. - Let's go. Thank you, Benny. Thank you. Welcome. Welcome. - Thank you. Welcome. - Thank you. We were dancing and they.. - Don't worry. Don't worry. What's going on? Having a party in Lonavala? - No, sir. - No. Rascals, Lonavala is getting a bad name because of you guys. No. No, sir. - No, sir. - They are inside. They are inside, sir. We are innocent, sir. They are inside? - Yes, they are inside, sir. Let's go. Let's go. - Let's go. Let's go. Get back. Don't move from here till sir doesn't return. Come on. Come on. - Where are you taking me? Let go of me, sir. I haven't done anything. Solanki. - Sir? You, here? I am on duty. He's with me. Sir, what are you saying? - Get in. Come on. Sir. Sir.. - Get in. Come on. Sir.. Your Honor, on 8th June, Saturday night.. ..at that farmhouse in Lonavala.. ..Benny Kutty and Babloo Charan Lathi.. ..supplied these six girls from the ladies bar. We are innocent, sir. They made them dance. And under the pretext of a private party.. ..they made them do a public show. Your Honor, Goyal Sinha, Ashwin Kelkar.. ..Mahesh Sarang and Maheshwari Iyer were present there. No. No. No. Your Honor, where is that officer? These people are not the same. Babloo Charan Lathi, you are refusing.. ..to recognize your clients to hide your crime? Your Honor, I am telling the truth.. - Okay. I would like to call the police inspector Solanki.. ..who was present there at the scene. Your Honor, that night, along with the two of them.. ..I arrested these four men. Your Honor, now tell us, will you trust Maharashtra's police.. ..or Babloo Charan Lathi who works.. ..at a cheap, disgusting ladies bar named Ghungroo? A place that is not less than a brothel. What are you saying, sir? Why do you relate all ladies bar with a brothel? Sir, I have worked there. Girls work there to run their households. That place is infamous, but it is not a brothel. And nor are these girls prostitutes. Your Honor, he is talking as if he is not working.. ..in a ladies bar, but a five star hotel. Your Honor, Mr. Benny Kutty works in a five star hotel. But he didn't even spare his friend. He got him involved in his business as well. And made him a pimp like himself. Who are you calling a pimp? He is my friend. He is not a pimp. If you want to see a pimp, then go to that five star hotel. Look, Benny.. What are you saying? - No.. No, Babloo. I had hidden everything from you till today. There's a turmoil taking place inside me. Sir, the party he is talking about.. ..was organized by my hotel. Mirage, the five star hotel. I don't know how they got a five-star certificate. Government gave it a five-star certificate to run a posh brothel. All illicit things take place here, sir. Someone's husband with someone else's wife.. Someone's wife with someone else's husband.. I feel embarrassed to talk about it. But such things take place there, sir. Two weeks.. In two weeks, I came to know that people aren't respected here. One should at least respect the dead, sir. Someone died in the hotel room after having a burger, sir. They kept him alive for the public. Then they took him to the nursing home.. ..and they declared that he died there. Why did they say that, sir? Sir, the hotel's reputation will get hampered as he died in the hotel. Hotels have great value here, sir. People don't have any value. What is over there? Yes, a disco. It is not a disco, sir. Drugs are sold there. Prostitution takes place in the disco, sir. And he is calling us pimp. We are earning by working honestly. What is your problem? Don't call us pimp. Mind it. I am Benny.. the.. Benny. I want to apologize to you. I.. I.. I used to pull your leg because you worked in a ladies bar. That also increased your height. You now reach till here. I am sorry. Benny. So this is what happens in five-stars. Don't worry. The culprits will be punished. The court is adjourned for today. Next hearing will be on the 21st of July. We will.. - Mr. Negi. What is happening? How did Benny and Babloo get involved in this case? You very well know that they are innocent. Sheena, calm down. Calm down. I know Benny is innocent. That's why I have called Mr. Shinde. He is one of the top most lawyers of India. And Benny is our staff member. He is one of us. We will see to it that he is out of trouble. But along with Benny, we have to save our hotel's reputation as well. I hope you understand. But if.. - Now this case is mine, Mr. Negi. I will handle everything. You don't need to worry at all. At the next hearing on the 21st of July.. ..if I don't get this case dismissed.. ..then I will leave my practice. Because section 128 and 178 are for.. ..those who send girls there in front of the witness. And there is no witness in this case. Therefore this case is null and void. Just do as I say. Okay, sir. Don't worry. You will be free on 21st July. 'Under section 127 and section 111..' '..all the girls of the bar are sentenced to 6 months' imprisonment.' '6 months' rigorous imprisonment.' 'Benny Kutty and Babloo Charan Lathi..' '..forced the bar girls to take up prostitution.' 'Hence under section 128 and section 278..' '..are sentenced to one year's imprisonment.' 'One year rigorous imprisonment.' "Beloved." "Don't.." That way, sir. - Thank you. Yes. Welcome. - Good evening, sir. - Good evening. Thank you. - That way, ma'am. Welcome, madam. Good evening, sir. That way, sir. - Thank you. Thank you. Hello, sir. - How are you, Mr. Negi? Welcome to Mirage. - Hello. - Hello, Sister-in-law. Hello. - Hello. Mr. Negi. - Hello, sir. You have one week's complimentary stay in this hotel.. ..so enjoy yourselves. Sister-in-law, you must try our spa. We have some great massages. - Yes? Beauty parlour and lots of stuff, you know. - Oh, sure. And we have loads of fun with the children, you know? He's such a cute kid. What is your name, Son? Never mind. Take them. Please come. - Come, this way. - Hurry up, come on. Sir, if you need anything, anything at all.. ..I am available 247. Look, Ram.. - Yes, sir? Mrs. Saigal has badly thrashed Mr. Saigal. I want you to prepare the bail documents right away. And you? Mahesh, go to Cooper Hospital. Mr. Saigal has gone to Cooper Hospital for a medical check-up. Make sure that the medical reports are light.. ..so that we can win this case. Hey, geek. Geek? - Yes, you. Hey, who are you talking to? Cool. I think he knows her. - Yes, who is she? Saw the way she was talking to sir? You forgot me, squirt? How can I forget you, Hema? Remember, you used to sit with one beer bottle.. ..and stare at me for 3 hours in the dance bar? Hema, I also used to give 10 bills of Rs. 10 as well. Yes. How can I forget that? But, friend, you haven't changed at all. You have just put on some weight. - No, I haven't. You feel so because I am wearing a coat, Hema. And you are losing hair as well. I got a haircut just yesterday, Hema. Your geek has become a very big lawyer. Amit Bhalla, advocate. But what are you doing here? The same old story, my friend. A raid took place. Others got released, but bar girls.. ..don't get a fair hearing or justice. We got sentenced for 6 months. God didn't give me a chance to do anything.. ..for you in the last 15 years, Hema. But now this Bhalla will not let go of this opportunity. 15 days. You all will be out in 15 days. Seriously. - Really? Yes. And listen. - Yes? Call me "geek" once again. - Geek. Great. "I'll signal through my eyes." "And steal your heart." "I'll signal through my eyes." "And steal your heart." Newbie, listen. "Why don't you understand me?" - Come here. Sir. - What is that girl's name? Sir.. "Why do you turn your face away and abuse me?" The one on the left or the one on the right? The one on the left. - The one on the left is Fedora, sir. What is her number? Here Rs. 500. Sir, 98335.. - After that? 5 numbers for Rs. 500, sir. I don't know the rest. I forgot, sir. You are clever, rascal. That I became, sir. Long story, sir. Then who will tell me the rest of the number? I will tell you, sir. Speak up. - Give me the money. Here. 58551. Sir, this is complimentary. Carrot. Good for eyes, sir. 'Don't get shocked.' 'I left Mirage and joined Babloo.' 'In the end, I am very happy.' 'I will give you some information about the Mirage people.' 'Sheena madam left Mirage and her husband as well.' 'Her husband is still paying the EMI.' 'Not for himself, but for the divorce settlement.' 'His house, car, and farmhouse are now with Sheena madam.' 'Look, that's why she looks so happy talking on the phone.' 'What? Not with me.'

From a bellboy, he became a waiter.' 'Not in a hotel, on a cruise.' 'A cruise means a ship.' 'Sometimes when he calls, I say, "What's up, Tom Cruise?" 'But he is happy now. Very happy.' 'Now.. Negi.' 'He is at the same post and still on the phone.' 'Nothing changed except for the hotel.' 'There is a less famous hotel in Malad.' 'It's called Dil Khush Lodging and Boarding.' 'As far as the five stars and the ladies bars are concerned..' '..they are doing their business as usual in our city.' 'As they say in our city, no matter what the situation, life goes on.'
