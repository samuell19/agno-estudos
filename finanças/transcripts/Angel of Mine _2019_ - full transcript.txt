Just a second! Okay, I'm just trying to help you. - Where are you? - Almost home. I told you I had a dinner meeting. I know. I'm turning onto the street now, okay? Do you see me? Jesus, slow down! You can always just leave him in the apartment. He's a big boy, you know? Leave him in the apartment? Is that how you want to spend your week together? Come on, baby. Hold on a second. This is for you. - Go upstairs, baby. - Can I see... Upstairs, Thomas. - Gee. - See you later, pal. Full custody? It's with visitation. I'm not trying to take him out of your life. You know this was coming. You have no grounds. I want what's best for my son. Our son. Don't we both want that? We do alternate weeks. We agreed. Yeah, we've been through all this. In high school, he's going to need a solid base. Half the kids in that school have divorced parents. Half the kids in the fucking world. Yep. Yeah, but you haven't been doing so great. Wow. He feels your darkness, Lizzie. My darkness? Come on. Look, I know you want him in as stable a situation as possible. I have to work half a day tomorrow. Again? Yeah. So Grandma will take you to Sam's party. And I'll come later. Do you want to do this? - Can I? - Yeah. Now just take the price tag off. I'm gonna get us some dinner ready, okay? Yeah. Hey, Mom, can I have a party like this someday? Uh, sure. Why not? - Really? - Maybe even in a house like this. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Ready or not, here I come! Boo! - Oh, no! - Oh, don't panic. It's all right. Can't sit back and watch an innocent skirt die. - Oh. - Here you go. I'm Claire. I'm Lizzie. Thanks. No worries. Who was that little girl? Which one? Really pretty. Big brown eyes. Long hair. She was in a pink dress. I think that's Jeremy's sister. Do you know her name? Who? Jeremy's little sister. No. No, why would you? Come on. Let's have an early one, love. Teeth, toilet, bed. Three, two, one. Ready or not, here I come! It's so good. I'm so excited. I haven't seen her for ages. - Bye! - Bye, Lola! Lola! - Hi! - Hi! - Come on! - Yeah, coming. What do you want for afternoon tea? - Muffins? - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. - Muffins, huh? Yes. When you're on the right wing, which is sometimes where you play, I know... - ...you've gotta cross the ball... - Hey, guys. - Oh, hello. - Hi. Good. You started without me. When the roast comes out of the oven, we eat. We're starving. Hey, trouble. You taking it easy on Mom and Dad? - Yeah. - We'll talk tactics later, okay? Cool. There you go. Oh, thanks. Mm-hmm. Hey, listen, um, can you have Thomas tomorrow night? Of course, gumman. And what have you got on? Oh. I know it's kind of last minute, but, um, I have a date. - Oh. Like to stay tomorrow, Tommy? - Yeah, sure. Tell me, who is he? How did you meet? Alice set it up. It's just... It's just a date. Mm. Really? Everything starts with a date. Good for you, Lizzie. Mum! Mummy! Mommy! Mom! I've got you! Hold onto me! Go away! I'm just trying to help! No! Do you want to light the candles? We need to remember her. Hi. Claire. It's Claire, right? Yeah. Sorry, I forget your name. Um, oh, Lizzie. From Sam's birthday party. You saved my skirt. - Oh, yes. Hi. - Hi. I saw this place listed online, and I thought I'd check it out. - What a coincidence it's you. - I know. So you guys are leaving? Yeah, I'm afraid so. We're moving all the way over to Perth. It's all happening really fast. Are you in the market? Well, I mean, if the right thing comes around. - Just love this neighborhood. - Yeah, it's great. Thomas. I got the new Act Of War. Wanna play? - Oh, Mom, please? - Oh, Thomas, I'm sure they are... It's totally fine. He can stay and play. - Oh, no, I don't wanna impose. - Oh, it's okay. It's like the planet's arranging a play date. - Please, Mom? - Can he? I mean, if it's no problem. I... Sure, why not? Um... But I won't stay, though. I've got some errands to do. You go do them. I'll keep my eye on these two. Okay, so what if I'm back in, let's say, an hour? - Yeah, great. We'll be here. - Okay. Let me take that, baby. - Have fun. - I will. See ya, Mom. - Bye. - Bye! - Hi. - Hi. I hope he wasn't too much trouble. Not at all. Thomas, your mum's here! Hmm. Oh, wow. Look at those ceilings. I would totally invite you in, but I have to take Lola to dance practice. Oh, I didn't mean to impose... If I wasn't in such a rush, I would. I was just thinking maybe I should bring my husband around, to come and look at the place. Hey. Or should I go through an agency, or... Uh, no, no, we can just go direct if you're really interested. Yeah, that would be great. Okay, uh, why don't you put your number in my phone, and I can text you some times - for later this week? - Sure. And bring Thomas. He and Jeremy had a terrific time. Don't forget your swimsuit. You can test out the pool. - Cool. Thank you. - Yeah? - Thank you. See you. - Bye. - See you. - Cool, see you. So you're half Swedish, half English? Yeah. My mom is Swedish. My dad is English. I grew up in Stockholm. So how long have you been single? Oh, I don't think of myself that way. I thought you were... Oh, I am divorced. It's just, you know... I'm kind of still... in the middle of it. I didn't mean to... No, no, it's fine. I mean, it's been a while. I... I should, you know... move on. Mm-hmm. Did Alice tell you I have children? Uh, she mentioned a son. Yeah, Thomas. I'd like to meet him. - Yeah? - Yeah. Uh... Uh, you have another? No, just Thomas. I thought you said "children." Thomas is a lot to handle, believe me. It's... As I said, it's been a while since I... socialized. Lizzie, let me look at you. Let me look at you. Look at me. Let me look at you. - Argh. - Stop! Stop. Okay? - I'm sorry. - Lizzie, don't... What? - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - Did I do something wrong? - Hi. - Hi. Sorry, we're a bit early. Oh, that's okay. Come on in. - Hi. - Hi, Thomas. Jeremy's in the pool already. Where's your husband? Oh, he couldn't make it. Last minute thing. That's too bad. I guess we're the ones that make the decisions anyway. - Yeah. - I'll show you the main part of the house, but that's our au pair's room, and bathroom here. This is our piano room. Oh, wow. You've got great taste. We travel, so I'm always picking things up. Living, dining. - The open plan was really important to us. - Mmm. - Is this better? - We put in the pool for the kids. It's a luxury, but we're hooked. Would you like to see upstairs? Yeah. So what do you do? I'm with Arlin Naturals. The one in Town Center. I'm the manager. Oh, nice. This is the master. Oh, it's beautiful. Do you like it? Your job? Yeah. I do. Spare room. It's great for guests. Mind you, sometimes I end up in here if Bernie's snoring. And this is Jeremy's room. It's a bloody mess. - It'd be great for Thomas. - Yeah. Oh, I love this one. We were at my parents' house. Jeremy was four. God, I was huge, and I was only six months pregnant there. Do you have other kids? No, just Thomas. And this is Lola's room. There's plenty of space for extra cupboards. How old is she? She's seven. And already a full wardrobe. Girls will be girls, right? Is she okay with the move? Oh, yeah. It's all she talks about. You know, Bernie told her there's a unicorn petting zoo in Perth, so... ...now we've got a double trauma coming up in the next couple of years between Santa Claus and now the unicorns. - Where are my monsters? - Oh, speak of the devil. - It's the unicorn whisperer. Come and meet him. - Hi, Daddy! I know it sounds really silly, but I really hope you buy the place. It would be in good hands. My God, this place has been so good to us. Maybe it'll be good for you too. Yeah. - Hello. - Hi. Lola, say hi to Lizzie. - Hi. - Hi. I watched you swim. You're really good. Thanks. Buy it, Mum! Well, that settles it, then. Meet the new owner. Well, we'll see, we'll see. Um, can I use the loo? - Yeah, down the hall on your left. - Thanks. What's your name, buster? Uh, Thomas. Now can I get you a drink? Yes, please. Just water. How was the pool? Not too cold for you out there, is it? - How many have you had today? - None! Put them back. We're on a budget, boys. Don't touch, okay? Just chew on some celery. Oh, come on, please! Hey. Can I come in? Okay. Wow. You have such a nice room. Aren't you gonna miss it? - A little. - Hmm. Hey, I know. Oh, look. What? Don't you think we look alike? She seems great. How long you two been friends? No, I barely know her. The kids play soccer together. We could invite her to stay for dinner. Yeah. We could. I was kinda hoping we might get the kids to bed early and have a date night. Thomas! Time to go home! You have the perfect layout. - Ask your mum. - Thank you. Can I go ice-skating on Wednesday with Jeremy? - Oh, Jeremy's obsessed. - Please? Baby, I think it's a family day. - No, no, it's fine. - No, he can come. Of course. - You sure? - Yeah, of course. Okay, sure. Why not? Um, sounds like fun. Go and get your stuff. Awesome. Thanks for showing me the house. I'm seriously thinking about it. Well, we'd seriously like you to buy it. Tell us about your date. There's nothing to say. Well, are you going to see him again? He was okay, but nothing special. Trust me. For a woman who married your father, you don't need special. Very amusing. It's just important to have relationships in life. I know. You're either at that job or stuck in the apartment. It's not enough. We're gonna buy my friend's house, so we won't be stuck. - Oh, really? - Yeah. Yeah, I was just looking around, seeing what's out there. - Sure. - It's big. Really big. And there's a pool. We used to do that. Window shop. Yeah, I know I can't afford it, but it's fun to look. You... You said we might buy it. Yeah, maybe one day, baby. You're such a liar! Thomas. That's enough. I hate the apartment. I can hear you clean your teeth. And I can hear you pee. So what? And I can hear you cry all the time. - I wanna live with Dad. - Thomas. You're always saying you'll get things done which you never do. Oh, that's not true. You know that's not true. Yes, it is. And you're always sad. I'm not sad. I'm not fucking sad. - Lizzie. - I'm getting it done, okay? I'm getting it done. You never get anything done! - Now now. - Come back here! - Dad! - Control him! It's okay, baby! It's not okay. And you shouldn't be swearing at him. I'm sorry. I'm sorry about the house. I got excited, and it was a dumb idea. I thought we were gonna live there. I'm sorry, baby. I... I know I'm not always the best mom. But, um... there's just a lot going on now. And I'm doing my best. I'm doing my best, baby. I love you. I love you so much, baby. When you hurt, I hurt too. I wanna live with Dad. Well, you do. Half the time. Not like that. Baby, we're gonna work it out. It's gonna be okay. It's not. Go and get your stuff, baby. Gumman. I'm fine. I don't know why. I just feel so fuck... Oh... Älskling, you don't seem to be... coping. Because before when you were... Stop treating me like a child, okay? - I'm an adult. - Of course you are. I just had a moment. We're just concerned. Just stop fucking being concerned about me all the time! It's driving me crazy! For Christ's sake, Lizzie, this isn't just about you! You have a son. Because you're on edge all the time, you're bad-tempered with him, you're forgetful. It isn't a healthy environment for a child. We thought you were doing better. - Well... - ...so did I. My parents just called. Thomas is sick. Really? Well, what does he have? Or is he just plain sick? He's vomiting and has a fever. I'm sorry, but I really gotta go. For God's sake, Courtney, her kid is sick. Just let her go. She can go. Of course she can go. Thanks, I appreciate it. He skates well. He comes with his dad sometimes. Jeremy is not... bad. Oh, he tries. How long have you lived here? About ten years. So they're both born here? Uh, yeah. Yeah, both at Landry Maternity. Oh, excuse me. Hi, Mum. Yeah, we're just at the ice skating rink. Yeah, they're doing well. Oh, yeah, we'll be over on the weekend for sure. - Yeah, we can bring some more. - Come on, Lola. How about one o'clock? Yeah, we can't wait to see you. Hey. No, no, I only just started packing the kitchen. Yeah, I only just got a few boxes. If you bend your knees a little bit, you'll get steadier. Want to hold my hand? Okay. Let's speed up. Keep looking ahead. Should we try something? You go in front. No! Shit! Lola! Lola! - Oh, my God. - No, don't... Don't touch her. Are you okay? Are you okay, honey? I'm so sorry. - Shh. It's okay. It's okay. - Is she okay? The guy just shot out of nowhere. Such an idiot. You were obviously going too fast. It's just a bump. It's just a bump, honey. I am so, so sorry. You have a tough little trooper right there. I wanna make it up to you guys. No, it's fine. It's okay. Um, I can take them off your hands this weekend. I'm with Dad this weekend. Or any weekday afternoon. Um, you know, they have so much going on already with the move and everything, so... Sure. Whatever works best for you. Yeah, we can... We'll just play it by ear. Come on, Jeremy. You ready? Let's go. - Okay, see you. - See you later. How's your day-to-day? Much better. I try to relax more. The other day I played hooky from work. I went ice skating with Thomas. Well, your secret is safe with me. And how are you both doing? He's great. I mean the two of you. Yeah, you know, we're, uh, we're good. We're... We're doing great. Good. So do you find yourself thinking less about Rosie? Mm, yeah. Yeah, less and less. And the medication. Do you feel it's helping? Absolutely. Yeah. - All right, that one's definitely coming. - Yeah. Care Bear. Still coming? - Yeah. - All right. What about Mr. Dinosaur? - Yeah. Yeah. - Are you sure? - I don't know! - Yeah. You have too many toys. Lola, can you grab me a glass of water from the kitchen, please? Yeah. - Just turn around. - It's so tight... Need a couple more pins in there. Mom, that's enough. You look like a real ballerina. I'm a bit scared, Mum. Well, it's okay to be a bit scared. But look, all the other girls don't seem nervous. Well, I am. Well, I'll tell you what. I'm going to be sitting in the audience, cheering you on with your dad and with Jezzy, yeah? - Come on, girls! - Oh, let's go. Okay, go on. Go on. No, stay with me. But look, all the other mums are going. Right, off you go. Go get 'em. You are going to be so amazing, yeah? You're my brave girl, and you're going to be great, and then we're going to be with you right afterwards, yeah? Okay, go on. Come on! Let's go. Oh, excuse me. Sorry. Sorry. - She all right? - Yeah, she's fine. Oh, my God. Hey, Lola. You okay? Wow. Oh, your shoes. They're so pretty. - I got them for my birthday. - Really? Hmm. When is your birthday? I'm on next. Don't be scared. I'm here. What's she doing? - I'll get Lola. - Okay. Do you think I should go back there? I would definitely. It'd be good to get up there again. - Hi. Sorry. - Hi, sweetheart. Um, she's not backstage. Well, she's... She'll be somewhere. Okay, I'll be back. Sorry. No worries. Yeah, so I mean, he did an incredible job for us. - It's probably not the best time. - No, no. I mean, it's hard, you know? Especially... Sorry, would you excuse me? Lizzie! Hi. - Hi. - How are you? Yeah, I'm good. Good. So you... you decided against the house? Yeah. Yeah, we ran the numbers and just can't swing the mortgage. - Right. Yeah. - I'm so disappointed. - I love it. I got carried away. - Oh. I feel so embarrassed. No, don't be embarrassed. It's understandable. You know, it's life. Erm, we're actually having a going away party, if you were interested. - Oh, yeah. Thanks. - Saturday week. - It should go on till quite late. Should be fun. - Yeah. Princess! Here she is! Oh, yes! I'm so proud of you. Did you like it? You were so good, my love. You were so great. So good. - Really? I was so nervous. - Mmm. Hi. Hi. We meet again. Is Thomas with you? I've gotta go and pick him up now. Do you know someone here? I just love ballet. And you were amazing. Did you see me looking over at you? Mm-hmm. - I've gotta go. - Sure. - Bye. - See you. That was odd. Yeah. Yeah, it was. You were so wonderful. You were so good. - Is somebody starving? - Yeah. - Starving to death? - Yeah. Okay. Wow, you have amazing skin. Great. Can we talk? Sure. Now? Preferably, yes. All right. Alice? - Mm-hmm. - Cover things for a few minutes? You never intended on buying the house. I'm trying to work it out. Work out what? I lost my baby daughter seven years ago. I didn't know. I'm... I'm sorry. She died. In a fire. At Bryant Hospital. Why are you telling me this? Because every time I see Lola, I'm more convinced. Convinced of what? I'm pretty sure she's my daughter. That's crazy. Hmm? You can't deny that she looks like me. You think Lola is your daughter? And what brings you to that conclusion? I just feel it. I think you have a problem. Something happened. No. No, I don't want to hear anymore. This is nuts. You know that, don't you? At the hospital, in the fire, in the confusion... Look, I'm sure that whatever happened to you was very painful, but Lola is my daughter. I can't believe I just had to say that. I don't know about that hospital, and I don't know about any fire. Okay? Lola was born at Landry Maternity. I'm very sorry for your loss, but I can't help you. I think you need therapy. I don't think our boys should play together anymore. And you need to stay away from my family. I don't think that proves anything. Susan doesn't spread gossip. She said it wasn't just a little time off. She said Lizzie was committed for almost a year. Yeah, but my love, she lost a baby. Imagine. No, I can't imagine it. I think we should call the police. Look, the point is, there's no law against being crazy, okay? People can say whatever they wanna say. I need you to hear me. She is stalking our family. Looking through our front gate when we've got a "for sale" sign up out there is not stalking. Come on. And, you know, the other places, the... the ice skating, I mean, you invited her to that. And the ballet? They're public places. None of it constitutes stalking. The cops are not going to do anything about it. So we're just supposed to do nothing? No, we don't do nothing. We just don't overreact. I'm not overreacting. You are. We lock the doors. We put the alarm on. Darling, it's okay. Okay. You walked out on a shift. Best of luck for your future endeavors. Thanks. Let's hope you're a better parent than you are an employee. You're hurting me. Lizzie, come on. Okay, so that's done. What else can I do for you? Uh, could you grab some more buns, please? - Yeah, sure. - And some veggie burgers? - Okay, you got it. - Thank you. Hey, thanks for looking after the kids. It's officially madness here. - Okay then, no worries. We're coping. - How are they doing? Well, they are loading up on sugar. You'll have fun tonight. Oh. Well, you make sure they eat a burger or something, will you? - Yeah. - Actually, are they handy? Can I say hi? Uh, well, Jeremy's playing soccer with his friends, and Lola went for a walk with your friend. - My friend? - Yeah. The nice one. Lizzie. - What? - She was gonna buy your house. Wait, is that... is that okay? No. Um, no, it's not okay. She seems really nice. Listen, I'm coming, okay? Claire, I'm sure it's fine. Um, do you want me to... Yes. No. Uh... Fuck. Look, uh, I'll handle it, okay? I can't believe you let her go on a walk with her. Do you wanna know a secret? I had a little girl once. A little baby. What happened to her? She... She was in an accident. I loved her very much. Do you love your mommy? She loves you too. Oh, shit. Come on, fucking move! Do you know what this is? It's the mark of an angel. When the baby is in its mommy's womb... it knows all the answers to all the mysteries in the whole world. Then, just before it's born, an angel places its finger on the baby's mouth. Shh. And the child forgets everything. That's why we've all got this little indent. Yes. That's it. All the answers are in us. But we have to be very quiet and very still to remember them. Do you remember me? There you go. - Hi. Where is she? - Hey! Uh, she's around here somewhere. - Where? - She just came back. Oh, there she is. God, sorry. You must think I'm mad. Not at all, I'm so sorry. She seemed really nice. - Hi. - Hi. - Are you good? - Uh-huh. What have you been doing? I went on a boat ride with Lizzie. Oh. Right. Um... What did... What did you talk about? Angels. Angels. Okay. Did you talk about anything else? Babies. Babies. Um... Honey, did she... Did she touch you at all? No. You sure? Yeah? Okay. - And you talked about angels? - Yeah. Right, well, that's nice. I'm here. I had to cover at work. Sorry. Hello, Lizzie. What are you doing here? And what are you doing here? The school called me. You didn't pick me up from soccer practice. Tommy, why don't you go upstairs? All right? Go on. I'm so sorry, baby. Lizzie. You know things have to change. Thomas is at an age. He just... It was a work emergency. There's always an excuse, Lizzie. Mom? Dad? Come on! You know things are better. Lizzie, we all care about you. - We want to support your healing process. - Oh, God. We feel that your best chance for full recovery will come with the benefit of another inpatient program. It's only temporary. I mean, I... I'm... What about Thomas? What about work? Alice called. She told us you lost your job. What? She called you? She fucking called you? She said she'd sent you tons of messages. What else could she have done? I'm dealing with everything just fine. It's just everyone else that... Listen to yourself. Everyone else? You're just not there for him. - I wanna talk to him. - Wait. When you came back... from that hospital, I don't think you ever really came back. That's not fair. Okay. Uh, look, I appreciate everyone's concern. The truth is that I, um... I've been focused on a... situation that's come up. It's actually kind of... incredible. I know this might sound crazy. I know. But I happened to meet this little girl. And I... I don't know for sure yet. There's a very strong likelihood... that it's Rosie. - Sweet love. - Yeah. Yeah? She's dead. Our Rosie is dead. No, you don't know that. Please don't say that. I'm trying to move on. I've been trying, but maybe there's a reason why I can't. I can't explain it, but I can feel it. Mike, it could be her. It could be our daughter. Lizzie, when will this end? Well, if you hadn't had her cremated back then, it could have ended with an autopsy, and we would have realized that it wasn't our daughter who was dead! You think I had a choice? You should have been there! You should have been with me that night! You told me to go home with Thomas! Lizzie, just stop! Please. Stop. We have been over this a thousand times. Whatever it is you're feeling... I feel for you. But you're not the only one that went through this. I did too. But you're still stuck back there. Why do you think I had to leave? And now Thomas is being affected. How? You make him celebrate her birthday. I'm not making him! Please don't make me take him away from you for good. It's not what I want. But I'm taking him this week. For now. - Are you two happy now? - Damn it, Lizzie. You've gotta stop living with a ghost. She's not coming back. Accept it! She is still alive! I can feel it! I'm her mother! - I'm her fucking mother! I would know! - Elisabet. Elisabet. You don't believe me. Oh, Lizzie! - Lizzie! - Lena! New message. Lizzie, it's Claire Bradley. What the fuck did you think you were doing at the river park today, taking our daughter out on a boat? You know, I've been understanding, but I'm at my limit. If you come near my family again, I promise you, we're getting the police involved. To replay... Message deleted. New message. Hi, it's Belinda Roberts calling from Bryant Hospital. You inquired again about getting information on previous patients. As I said before, our policy states patient records are only shared with immediate family, for which we'd require identification. If you have any further questions, feel free to call. Thanks. To replay, press seven. To delete, press three. You looking for the bathroom? Uh, yeah. Yeah. It's just through there. Thanks. What are you doing here? Your husband invited me. You need to leave my house. I'll pay for a DNA test. It's the only way. Excuse me? I know what I know. God! - I want my daughter back. - Get out! You're sick. Do you understand that? You need to leave my family alone once and for all, okay? We are now officially in restraining order territory. You need to get the fuck off my property before I call the police. Fuck. - You okay? Was that her? - Yeah, it was. I thought you called her and told her not to come. I did call her. - Okay, here's our Uber! - Bye, guys! - Thanks for the party! - Great party. - Thanks for coming. - See ya. Come visit us in Perth. - Yeah, we will. - Safe travels. - Love you guys. - We'll miss you. - Pass the platters? - Sure. Just leave them. I'll get them. No, I'm just gonna rinse them off. Okay. Come on. Let's do the rest in the morning. Okay. Can you lock the back? Come to bed, my love! I'm just setting the alarm. Can I just say, I am so, so sorry that I didn't take you more seriously about how crazy she is, okay? And look, you were right. I should have done something when she took her out on the boat. Tomorrow morning, after I pick up the kids, we're going to go to the police station and we will get a restraining order, okay? Thanks. I'm going to get the kids, sweetheart. Okay. Anything you need? No, just them. You broke into my home, and you attacked me. - I could fucking end this right now. - Stab me. - Stab me! - Listen to me! You are going to walk out of my life right now. No, I'm not. You have to kill me 'cause I'm never gonna stop. God! I know what I know. And what is that? You have no idea what it's like to lose a child. To spend every day missing a piece of yourself. To live with a grief that never goes away. I... I lost my baby girl. I lost my husband. My marriage. My son is being taken away from me. I lost my job. I can't even go on a date. I can't laugh, I can't sleep, I can't eat. I used to be funny. I used to be funny. You're out of your mind. That's what everyone's been saying... for seven years. But I... I know what's mine. No. Nothing is yours. I'm gonna prove it. I'm gonna hunt you down and prove it. - You better get the fuck out of my house! - I'm never gonna stop. - Get out! - I'm gonna get that DNA and your disgusting, ugly secret is gonna come out, and everyone is gonna know what you really are. Get out. Get out. You were there. At the hospital. Don't you fucking lie to me! Don't lie to me! I want the whole fucking world to know what you are! That you're a thief and a fucking liar. - I'm not! - You stole my child. - You stole my baby. - No. No, I saved her. I saved her. I saved her because I lost my baby. I lost my child to the fire. She choked to death. Oh, fuck! I saw a dead woman on the floor. I didn't see your face. There were flames and smoke everywhere. I already had milk in my breasts. I lost my baby... and another one needed me. I didn't even see it. I heard it. Her. You heard her. Her. Lola. No. My Rosie. I was alone for the birth. Bernie wasn't there. I didn't have anyone. He doesn't know Lola isn't his. Please. Please don't take her from me. Please. Mummy? Oh... In the car, kids. Okay. It's all right. I'm s-sorry. I'm sorry. Is it true? I'm so sorry. It's her. I found her. Rosie. - Want some lemonade, Tom? - Yeah. Um, so, how often is she going to be staying with us? Um, we don't know yet, babe. We're still working it all out. Maybe just a little bit at first. Cool. At least for now, until Claire's trial is over. But you're her mother. She should live with you. - And Mike, too, of course. - Hmm. Hello? You ready? Hi. Hi. Hi. I'm so happy you're here. Hello, Lola. It's very lovely to meet you. I'm... I'm Mike. Hi, Mike. Hi. Um... would you like to come inside? Yeah? Um, I got an idea. Would you like Jeremy to come with you this first time? Hmm? Thomas is out the back. Uh, yeah. That's... That'd be fine. Jez, do you wanna come and hang with Thomas and Lola for a bit? - Yeah. - Okay, good boy. Yeah. This is Grandma. Hello. My name is Lena. It's so lovely to meet you. So lovely. - Hi, Lola. - Hi. I'm Carl, your grandpa.
