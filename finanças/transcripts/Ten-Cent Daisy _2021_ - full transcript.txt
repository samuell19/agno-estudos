Is Daisy with you? -Are you okay? -[Orchid] They took her. Two men. Uh, Drew and Leonce. They said Meera sent them. Leonce? Where do we know Leonce from? Former inspector, Albert Leonce. He investigated Daisy's case. He believes that Iris confessed to John's murder to cover for Daisy. He spent ten years trying to prove it. It drove him mad. I hired a lawyer to work on her case. He's very good. She's getting out. -I heard. You did that? -Yes. Thank God. Thank you. Meera must have found out. Yes, we have to get Daisy home immediately. I know where they took her. Meera won't hurt her. She needs her. I'll take care of it. [Orchid] I'm coming with you. I don't think that's a good idea. This is my problem to take care of. [Orchid] Violet, enough already. We are going to face this together. Or I'm gonna drive to Napa and knock on every door until I find you. You better come get me then. -[Orchid] Where are you? -Hang on. Please text her your address. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Easy now. A gun? -What's that for? -Protection. No, we won't need that. You never know. [Otis] No. Give it here. Look, give it here. It'll only complicate matters. No way, dude. Look, I can't go if you bring that thing. I can't-- I won't go without it. You don't know who we're dealing with. -I'm out. -Fine. I've got a ride. I don't need you anyway. You don't get it. It's a trap. [car honking] [honking continues and tires screeching] -[Leonce] Pull over. -[Drew] Why? [Leonce] Pull over. [Crickets chirping] [Drew] What? [Leonce] Get out of the car. [Drew] Yeah, right. -[Leonce] Step. -[gun cocking] This one is mine. [Drew] You're a traitor. -You're a traitor. -[Leonce] Hang on. We have a long way to see how the story ends. [gravel crunching] Wait right here. [water sloshing] [Meera] What do you think? A little taste of home? I had the water brought in. It's as close to the real thing as you can get. Hello, Daisy. Do you remember me? Perhaps not. It's good to see you again. We've seen each other in the past, but not like this. Alone. [Meera] Would you like to go for a swim? Iris is very sick. They want to whisk you away to the islands to save her, right? She sacrificed so much for all of us. She is strong, loving, generous. She's a fighter. [chuckles] And rebellious, too. Yes. She is everything you would want in a mother. But the truth is... the painful truth is... Iris no longer serves any real purpose in this world. Not to herself, not to you, not to anybody. And I think it's best that we just let her slip away and get her much deserved rest. I know it sounds cruel, but if you're patient with me, I'm sure you'll understand. How is Zara? You know Zara? Of course. She's... 11 years old. You came back for her at the right moment. I wish I'd done the same for you. I, too, abandoned my daughter on day one. It's nothing to be ashamed of. It's who we are. Zara, too, will do the same. And she'll find a strong, loving fighter of a mother to raise her daughter until she's ready to take over. You must have noticed a pattern by now. I hold myself responsible for what happened to you. I fell in love with the land. I wanted to experience it and I did. But, I'm not done. And I have no regrets... except for what happened to you. I came back too late. And when I returned, and I saw what happened... I couldn't help myself. I tore into that so-called man of God. I fileted him beyond recognition. His mother shed tears until the day she died. And Iris... confessed to the murder for me. She knew I couldn't survive in their prison. But what she didn't know is that they would turn around and accuse the mystery child. You, the victim. But, they had no evidence. So, I got you out of there. Just like I did Violet... and Orchid. So, you see... I'm the fairy godmother. And I'll make it up to you... if you let me. You let Iris waste away in prison. Iris is a sufferer. Do not pity her. That's what happens here. Do not pity her. [ethereal music plays] [water burbling] [water splashing] [water burbling] The water's invigorating. Why didn't I think of this sooner? Come on, jump in. [chuckles] Ignore them. [chuckles] Don't bother with him. Come on. Daisy. Come on, Daisy. I invited you here to offer you an opportunity. One that I never had. I made my own way, but you have a choice. You can go and be with Iris and watch her live out her life in a miserable town by the sea. Or you can stay here with me. We'll go places you've never imagined. Love, riches, admiration await you. I will make sure you are happy, respected, feared, and celebrated every day. [emotional music plays] [Violet] Daisy. [Orchid] Daisy, wait.
