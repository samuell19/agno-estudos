I like seeing things like that. Just little snapshots. You know, like the city's a living thing, know what I mean? Like a big ant's nest, is that what you mean? Huh? Like seeing people going about their...? This and that. Yeah, their this and that. Their critter business. Just a real hive of activity. Yeah. So what's your brother like? Um, I don't know. Just this guy. Like him. Which one, the headless guy or the thigh tapper? More like the headless guy. We used to be close, but. I don't know. He... Became a mechanic? Became a mechanic, exactly. Wish I could work with my hands. It's very attractive. Really? Mm. The work of hands is trustworthy. Words. Words are not. Should we, um, go that way? Yeah. What time are you leaving tomorrow? Are you leaving tomorrow? I'm not sure. Early afternoon. Have you booked your flight? - No, I'm driving. - Oh, yeah, the car. Thinking of going on a hike on the way back down. What's the car like, your brother's car? Manual, automatic? Manual. Nice. Me too. You drive manual? Mm-hm. Oh. Oh no. It's gone to its people. Had that water bottle for two weeks. Where are you thinking of going hiking? Do you like hiking? Yeah, I really do. Yeah, yeah, same. Oh, hey, how are you going? I'm fine, how are you? Yeah, yeah, I'm good. Whoa. Good to be out of the car. I think that's the office up there, so I might just go and see what's up. All right, I'll come. Ah. Did you see that woman giving birth on the side of the road? Actually, I'm just gonna go fill up my water bottle. I'll just see you in there. Of course. You want a little coffee? Sure, yes please. - G'day. - Oh, g'day. Just thought that I'd better let you know that I'm not sure whether they actually allow you to camp on this lawn here. Oh, really. Yeah. Oh, well, strange, they didn't mention that to us. Well I thought you'd wanna know about that because, you know, a couple of days ago I set up here and thought I was doing the right thing. I thought a great place it was. And then they came, to my dismay, and moved me on. Yeah, no no, appreciate it. Thanks for the heads-up. Maybe it's because you've got a bigger vehicle, like a four-wheel-drive thing. I don't think so, but maybe, you know, who knows? Yeah, we were up there just a while ago and they didn't mention it, but we could always go back and check. Did you talk to them? Yeah, yeah, we did. I think she saw us come this way, so, I'm not sure. Maybe she didn't know you were here. I'm pretty sure she did. Anyway, we can always, as I said, go and have another chat to them. - No worries, guys. - Thanks mate, appreciate it. Yeah, I just thought I'd let you get a heads-up so that, you know, if you get all set up and they come along and move you on, you wouldn't have to worry about that. Yeah, no, of course, thank you. Thank you. What do you reckon, should we move? Well, what did she say? She didn't mention anything. Um, I don't know. Do you reckon he was trying to? That was pretty weird, the way he came straight up to us. I mean, pfft, why don't we just stay here? If she says something, we can move. Yeah. - What do you reckon? - Yeah, I agree. But do you reckon? I reckon, do you? - I reckon. - Good. Hey, you wanna go check out the water or something, go for a walk? You wanna swim? Maybe, no, I'm more just interested in checking it out, maybe go for a walk down there. Uh, I might just stay here for a bit. Sure, are you all right? Yeah, yeah yeah, I'm fine. I just wanna have a five-minute lie-down. Yeah, of course. Well, let me know if you need anything. I might still go if that's all right with you, and then I can pick something up for you if you want. Yeah, no, no, no. I'm good, thanks. I'm just gonna have a quick nap. Cool, all right, see you. Who's older, out of you and your boyfriend? What do you mean, what boyfriend? I saw you drive in. Oh, that's not my boyfriend. We just ran into each other. How did you run into each other? Um, well, we were both visiting Brisbane, and we caught up for a drink. You like drinking? Yeah. I'm just driving my brother's car home from Brisbane, but yeah, he's just a friend from Sydney. We don't really know each other. I just, um... What? I just thought it'd be fun, you know. Are you having fun? Uh. I'm getting over someone. Do you know what that means? No. It means, there's someone out there who I love, who I can't be with anymore. Why? Uh. What's your job? What about you? What are you doing here? Don't you have school? I'm home-schooled, by my dad. He's taking me on a trip around the country. And what do you think of the country? I mean, it's all the same. Weeds, trash. Roads. Rabbit shit. I work for a regulator. Do you know what that is? Nope? I investigate Australian corporations to make sure they're obeying our tax laws. Do you wear a uniform? Not really. Are you a bad bitch. I'm trying. It's not really about trying. It's more about being. Oh, all right, okay. Nestor was just telling me about the Boyds. They used to be friends with the family. Oh, the artist? - Are they from Sydney? - Yeah, they were from Sydney, yeah. - Were you from Sydney? - Yeah. And you? Yeah, I'm from Sydney. Oh, okay. You know, I grew up in Sydney, but as I was saying to Ray, I think Sydney was a much more interesting place then. Hm, how? Just more, sort of intellectually curious. There was a lot of discussion around the evolution of the culture in Australia at the time and people were willing to discuss things and talk. The doors were always open. You could walk in and meet people, complete strangers, and have conversations. About art, music, philosophy. That's the painter, right, Arthur Boyd? Well my parents were friends with Guy Boyd. Yeah, Guy Boyd the sculptor. And they were part of the Bohemian set in the '50s, of artists, intellectuals, so we were dragged as kids around all the different houses. And, you know, made to stay up late into the night and listen to their discussions and the smoke and everything. Yeah, it was crazy. Dad, can Alice have a look at Mum's clothes? No, I don't think so. She's the same size. I don't think so. Yeah, she's the same size. Yeah, but she's not going to want it. - I can ask her. - What's this? Lauren's mum, my wife, she passed away about two years ago. Oh I'm so sorry. No it's all right. She was a great designer. She made some fantastic clothes. We thought we'd bring her with us, so they're all in the caravan. We thought we'd give them to people we met along the way, but it sounds a bit weird when I tell them. It's not weird. Can I give her a tour of the whole caravan? Yeah, that's fine, darling. Doesn't worry me. Just remember to turn the switch on. And when you're finished, turn it off, okay? Okay. This is my bed. You sleep in the same bed? Yeah, well, when my Mum was here, I used to sleep on the foldout. But this is way more comfy. Mm. Oh, wow, that's actually really cute. Mm-hm. Ah, beautiful. You want me to try these on? Yeah, try them on. Oh, it's that soft. I kept one. Which book was it? That's a good point. I can't remember. Mm. I've got it in the bottom of my suitcase somewhere. What is it? Ah, Pessoa. Pessoa, don't actually even know what that is. Pessoa, Portuguese writer. Oh. You sure you don't wanna keep them, for when you're older? Yeah, that's what I said. But Dad says there's nowhere to keep them. Well I could store them for you, until you're older. I have a massive garage. Try these ones on. Gorgeous. Hm, if a man had stolen a pound in his youth and had used that pound to amass a huge fortune, how much was he obliged to give back? The pound he'd stolen only, or the pound together with the compound interest accruing upon it, or all his huge fortune? Hm. What do you think? Uh, I don't know, the whole fortune probably. I'd say the whole fortune's probably impractical. Well is it about what's right or what's practical? Well, it's in the context of the Catholic Church here, so. Is it about land? I think it's more just a general question of justice or something. Mm. There's something about reading in tents I find so relaxing. I find it too relaxing. I always just wanna fall asleep. Have you got enough room up there? Do you mind if I put my head up that way? This gradient's a bit much. Yeah, for sure. So, what's the plan? I'm not sure. I mean, kind of just do whatever. Maps are so annoying, don't you reckon? Mm I kind of love them. You're so hot. Your skin's so warm. Is it? I think it's just your hand. No, it's your forehead too. No, I think it's still your hand. It's all sweaty. I can feel it. So you wanna go for a walk or something? Hmm. No. That guy Nestor was talking about a walk up into the national park, that'd be cool. I thought about that too, but I don't really feel like going for a walk right now. You feel like going for a walk? Oh, hang on. What? Can we just slow down a little bit? Oh. Uh, yeah. Sorry, it's just going a little bit fast. A bit fast, what do you mean? I really just thought we could hang out a little bit more first. Um. Sure. I'm sorry, it's just I don't know. I just thought we could hang here a little more, not go so speedy. Um. What is that we're taking slow? All of this. I'm just a bit confused about what I'm actually doing here. Like, I don't really want anything. I got the impression that, did you think this was like a full-on thing or? Can you just, can you keep your voice down? Sounds travel straight through these tents. Why do you care? Who cares? It's that little girl. Who, Lauren? Is that her name? Oh, she was right there. Just right there between those trees. I don't see her. She's spying on us. Oh, this is hilarious. What's wrong? Nothing, mate. Mate? What's that supposed to mean? I just, this was a bad idea. I'm sorry, just, I need some air. - She's out there. - Don't open that side. It's like 800 degrees in here. You're obsessed with air. So, they did want you to move after all, in the end? No, no, we just decided to, you know. Better spot. They did, actually, they just- Oh no no, apparently, yeah no, apparently she did. Oh she did asked you then? Yeah, she asked us. I just didn't mention it. Why the hell didn't you mention it? Why should I have? You suggested moving for the view. I don't know. It's just a bit weird that you didn't even mention it like at all. Yeah! She did ask you, did she? Yes, she did. Yeah, yeah she did. Yeah, it's just that, I thought that, you know, I thought I was going a bit mad, that's all. Oh yeah, right, no worries, mate. What time is it? I don't know. You don't have a watch? No, no I don't. - Not a wristwatch? - What about your lady? No, I don't think. Do you have your phone on you? - No. - No, we don't, sorry. Oh, well. Are you going bush walking up there? There's plenty of Aborigine doodles up there, you know, that you can have a squiz at. But it's getting late in the afternoon now. And there's not really a lotta time for, it might be a bit too late for big adventures, and I don't know what time it is, that's the thing. I don't know what time it is. We don't have a watch. Sorry, mate, I don't know. Well, in that case, there's nothing more. I'll just have to, we'll have to just never mind about those things, and there's always tomorrow. Yeah. Oh, my God. - I'm really sorry. I've gotta go. - Oh, I'm sorry. Oh my God, is this too long and boring? No no no no, I've just got an appointment. I didn't realise the time. It's in, like, 20 minutes. - I think I've gotta go right now. - I'm sorry, let me get the coffees. No, no, I'll get them, I'll get them. I really have to finish this story, though, because. - Because what? - I'll tell you later. Tell me, tell me now. Tell me now. - No, I'll tell you later. - Yeah, yeah, I've gotta go. All right, my darling, I'll call you tomorrow night? Yes. Or, no, gotta go see my grandparents. Like sometime this week. - Yes, yes, yes, yes. - All right, bye-bye. Oi. Man, I completely fucked my back. Rugs are really heavy. They're not that heavy, but if you're throwing them around like that, you gotta do it the right way. Yeah, shit. Sorry, man, I'm a bit grouchy. Been on the back foot all day, and started off a bit behind. I hope I'm not putting you out. No no, not at all. Looking forward to this. This is gonna be good. I, yeah, I really appreciate this, you hooking this whole thing up. David's a funny fellow. I think you guys'll get along really well. Yeah? That's good. I was gonna ask, actually. He knows I haven't done this before, right? Yeah, I didn't mention it to him, but you just tell him whatever you want. You know, I think it'll be all right. Right-o. Can I put the air con on? Yeah yeah, yes please. It still stinks in here. I wonder if there's a giant pile of shit in the street. Things are falling apart, eh. I reckon it was the police horses on Anzac Day, the Anzac parade, you know. The parade, of course. You and I can't shit on the road, though. Know what I mean? Yeah, I mean, we could do it at night maybe, but. What is that? What is that, chicken, crispy? How you been, mate? I feel like I haven't seen you properly in ages. Yeah, I'm fine, you know. Just pottering around, the usual really. Yeah? Yeah, yeah, I don't know. Been a bit of a shitty year, really, but, you know, it's nearly over, just kinda looking forward to it being wrapped up, you know. Yeah that's what I mean. How's everything? How's it been going? I mean, yeah, up and down, I think. You know, some weeks I feel fine and then kinda feel like crap for a while, but it alternates, I think that's normal. Yeah, that's normal, as long as you're all right. Yeah, I mean, yeah, what do you mean? Oh no, nothing. - Is there something...? - I mean, well, to be honest, I bumped into Sophie on the weekend. Oh, yeah? Where? - Just at a party. - Yeah? Where? Oh, you don't need to worry about that, mate? I'm not worried. I'm just interested. Just at my mate Harry's party. Oh, what the fuck, why the fuck was she there? She doesn't know those people at all. She was just with her friend. - You know, the real tall one. - What, a female friend? Yeah. What was she, what was she doing? Oh, we just had like a quick, five-minute chat, and I just, you know, told her I hadn't seen you in ages and she said I should probably check in with you. You know, she knows we're mates. Have I done something? Have I upset you? No, no, not you, I just, I'd prefer not to talk about it right now, you know. Focus on what we're doing and maybe another time, you know? Yeah, it's okay if you don't wanna talk about it now. But can I be honest about something with you? About what? Obviously, you've had a rough trot. Your fucking long-term girlfriend cheats on you, and like, fuck. But how long's it been? Ages. You don't wanna be a clam about it and just have all these forbidden zones that are off limits. Are you working through it? I find it helpful to just move on, really. I don't wanna dwell. That's bullshit, isn't it? Seriously. To just like get all that bad stuff and just lock it behind some door and just go, see you later. Your memory's like a big mansion with all these different doors, and when you lock off whole sections, that's when things start to get real freaky. Don't they? What's funny? If you don't deal with fucked up things properly, that's when things become haunted. Like, I'm not trying to take the piss, but you watch horror films? They never end up good. No, no they don't. And look, I appreciate it, I do accept that. But right now, I just feel like everything's okay. I just need to sorta stay the course. And keep going. - Oh, what the fuck? - Fucking hell. What is that? What is that? What the fuck? - Fuck, pull over down here. - Can I stop just here? Are you stupid? Just pull over down here. Smells like shit. It stinks. Look at my hands. What's up with them? I don't know. Shaking. Oh my God. I know him. - Hey. - How are you going? Good and you? - Good. - Good. Nice spot you got here? Thanks, babe. What are you doing? I just had some really bad luck, actually. My car broke down in the middle of Oxford Street. Fuck. Yeah, but help's on the way, so. Good, where are you going? Oh, just a bit of a meeting actually. A job opportunity. Yeah, big opportunity, should be good. Your hair looks nice. You reckon? Yeah, it's great. Nice job. Thanks. How have you been? Yeah, pretty good, good. Just like working at the shop, and I kinda wanna move overseas, like maybe this year at some point. Yeah, cool. I should probably run, actually, but it was nice to meet you. I didn't introduce myself. I'm Ray. Hi, I'm Kat. Well, yeah, it was good so see you again. - We should catch up before you go. - Yeah, let's do it. Awesome. See you. Bye. Who was that? Oh, my God, that is so fucking weird. My friend Alice like literally just finished telling me this full-on story about him and this weekend they had away and it was like... Last weekend? Well, it was like a month ago. He was really cute. - You reckon? - Yeah, you guys were totally flirting. No, no, like, that's just him. I think he's full on. Is he a bit of a weirdo? No, I think he's just like, earnest, like one of those sincere guys. Can you reverse? Not really, Raymond. Why not? Can't you just go? No, it's one way back there. - Where? - On the side street, where you come in. Oh, you could just go. No, it goes straight back to Oxford Street, and you can't turn right there for ages either. Fuck. Thanks for coming to get us, Carol. Aw, it's no trouble really, Miles. No, it's very much appreciated, thanks. Well, you've gotta be on time for something like this. Should I just go and ask how long they're gonna be? Call out or something? Can't hurt. No, that's rude, just yelling out. Well jump out then. It's fucking selfish, though. Like there's clearly enough room if they'd parked actually on the curb. I mean, look at this child's terrible posture and his poor attitude to his work. Just bad people. It's fucking ridiculous. Would you stop complaining and swearing, please? Everyone's here to help you, and you're carrying on like a pork chop. I'll do it. Honestly, Raymond, when are you gonna grow up? I'm tempted just to leave you here. And what are you gonna do with your car? Are you just gonna leave it sitting there? I think it's the one back there. I think it's up here, but that's all right. We'll get out here. Thanks, Mum. Yeah, thanks heaps, Carol, really appreciate it. No problem. You okay? Oh, I don't know. What? - I feel really sick. - Oh, fuck. Can you walk? Yeah, I can walk. Good day, fellas, how's it going? My friend's a bit sick. We were just passing by, and he just. Okay. Just, uh. He's just feeling a bit unwell. Tuition of, lots of kids, violins, kids with special needs, that sort of thing. Used to be in an ambient electronic band in the '80s. Hot Porpoise, you wouldn't remember us. Hot Porpoise? I love Hot Porpoise. Legendary. Cool, mate, yeah, that's good. Oh, hold that thought. That's actually very rare that. This is my wife, okay. You blokes just, sh, keep it very quiet. Stand still. Are you okay? Yeah, we're just house sitting here actually. This is my brother's place. He's a banker, corporate financial services. So what brings you blokes this way anyway? I'm actually, I'm meant to be making a wedding video for this guy, the guy next door. We're meeting about now I think. Actually, everybody on this street's in finance. Usury, in the old parlance. Very strange people. - Really? - Oh, yes, indeed. People with a lot to hide, let me tell you. I just sit here, mate. Put on some comfortable clothes, get drunk. I ate the same food as him. I don't know, should I, should I have one as well? Well, there you go, that's for you. - Ate the same stuff, did you? - I think so, didn't I, Miles? Probably infected with the same thing. Cheers. Mm. Hey, I'm Ray. Good day, come in. Mate, where's Miles? Am I late? Well you are a bit. Miles is, he's been struck down by this really bad, this stomach thing. It sorta happened just out there, but then the guy next door sorta saw us and took us in. Next door? What, there? Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah. - There? - Yeah. What the fuck is he doing there? Mi... Miles, is in there? - Yeah. - Well, we better go and get him. Sure, sure. He's in there, Miles? Yeah, he's just on the couch, you know. I'm sure he's okay. No, no way. We have to get him. We have to get him out. Miles is in there? - Dad? - Yeah? I'm here with Ray, the video guy. He's here? Where are you going? Just here with Ray, Miles' friend. Do you wanna meet him? - Hi. - Hey, how are you going? Good thanks. Look, I'm sorry about this mixup. I didn't actually know there was a specific time. Yeah, it was supposed to be 12. You told them that, right? They knew that? Sorry. Mate, you have fucked us around a bit. It's been an hour. No call, nothing. We didn't have a number to call. Just would have liked a phone call, that's all. - Jesus. - Of course, yeah, sorry. All right, I'm gonna go and get Miles because we can't leave him in there, not right. No, Dad, we have to go in like five minutes. All right, I'll be back. You two get acquainted. I'll go get Miles, and I'll be back, all right? Sorry, what was your name again? - Ray. - Come in. Oh, sorry, you're Louise? Yeah. Sorry, it's just I've got a fitting appointment with the bridesmaids today for their outfit. - Well, I don't want to... - No, it's okay. Keen to get this sorted, though. Well, if you'd like to move it or? Oh, no, I'm... Sorry, I don't mean to be. It's just, I'm trying to organise five people's availabilities, massive headache. Oh, of course. Of course. So? Yeah, so, we'll be shooting in here? You'll have the reception in? No, it'll be outside actually. I'll take you out. What is that noise? Yeah, the guy next door, he's got a pretty nice hi-fi. He's got some music playing. The ceremony probably down here with an archway. Right, perfect, lovely. Yeah, it should be nice. - Well, I knocked. - There's no answer. Do you hear that music coming from the front? I'm sure he's pretty fine there. They were just playing some tunes, relaxing. Relaxing? Is he crook or what? Yeah, he's pretty sick, yeah. He's just, recovery mode, lying down, that's what I meant. - Can we call him? - Not really. - Why not? - He hasn't got a phone. That's what I was trying to say. Jesus, he's one of them. Mate, what you need to know is, we're in dispute with these neighbors next door. Really? Yeah, absolutely. They tried to build a bloody big pontoon. Huge thing, wrapped around here, the pool. A family, like tentacles. Jesus, sounds dark. Dark? We had to fight them off in court. Wow, did you win? Jesus, what are we gonna do? Lou? We can't leave him there. I don't know, and I don't care. You and I have bigger things to worry about. Maybe we should get him outta there. Well, you can get him outta there, but you and I have bigger problems. Look, we would have called if he had a phone. You know, just avoid all the stress. Look, if he's already lying down, I don't see the point of moving him. Maybe we should, yeah, let him rest. Yeah, let him rest. What the hell is that? Sammy. It's the bloke next door. Apparently, that's music. This is the video guy. Come down and meet him. Hang on. So, this mustn't be a bad little earner. Video gigs? Yeah, they're fairly, uh, I mean, remunerative. Is that a word? You mean lucrative? - Yeah, yeah, I think so. - What did you say? Remunerative. I don't think it's a word. I think I just made it up. So what, it is lucrative then, is it? Lucrative, probably too strong a word. But it's a good earner, isn't it? I mean, it's not piddling. - Piddling? - Piddling. Not piddling. Piddling? Piddling, pissy, puffy, nothing, inconsequential. Oh, no, it's consequential. Yeah. But where's it leading? All over. Anywhere you want really. That's sort of the beauty of it, I think. Mate, let me ask you. Are you a fan of mystery and intrigue? Okay, so Brian is asking if he can take the spare mattress down to the park. Why? So down to Jess' house. Jess' backyard. Why? It makes no sense. The double? No, abso-bloody-lutely not. He's not happy. Well he can bloody well stay not happy. This music is driving me nuts. It's a bit freaky, isn't it, this music? Yeah. Where are you going? Lou? I have to make a call. Oi. Through there, yeah. Oi. Oi, oi. Hey, hey! Hey! Are you calling me, David? Oh no, Roger, not you. Roger, that's Ray. Come in for a sec? Hey, hey, I got a drink. Coming outta the sandstone. Looks like the scary music's here to stay then. Ah, thanks. Wasn't that queen pink before? What? Wasn't that a pink queen just now? Queen's blue. But, no, it was pink before. What the fuck are you talking about? I coulda sworn it was pink. - I must have imagined it. - Imagined it? Pink queen? You might wanna think about calming that monkey mind of yours. Put that monkey to sleep. And stop looking around for a second, will you? Just relax. Nothing horrific. Nothing hidden or dark or weird. Nice cold beer. Just enjoy a beer. Relax. You can look at the ground if you need to. Nice relaxing beer. You better finish that one off. A man can do what he wants. But he can't want what he wants. Let's go up and see my youngest, Sam. She's thinking about studying film at uni. Yeah? Hi, Sammy. Just here with... What's your name? Ray. Here with Ray, can we come in? Yeah. Whoa, Jesus. What's that smell? That smells like fried chicken. What is that? Yeah, it's KFC. We had a bunch. Sammy, this room is an absolute disgrace. Anyway, this is Ray. He's a bit of a film guy, so I thought if you had any questions, this would be a good opportunity to have a bit of a chat with him. So, get a bit of work like this do you mate? Yeah, yeah, yeah, a bit. Well what, events, weddings, what? Well I worked on, I worked sort of all over, you know, all sorts of stuff. But like what, mate? Weddings, I actually try and avoid, because the people can be a bit... - Insane? - Yeah. Well not the people so much, just the overall, ambience. Jesus Christ. Where's it going for you, though? I mean, I get it. Weddings, events, but what's it gonna amount to? - What do you mean? - Well, where's it leading to? Because I'm sensing it's a bit, bit strange. A hill of beans, is that the expression? - Yeah, not much, you're telling me. - Oh, no, no. Doesn't amount to a hill of beans? Yeah, that's it, but I'm just kidding. What have beans got to do with it? A hill of beans is worth nothing. Beans are worthless. Beans are trash. Watch your mouth. What do you mean? What do I mean? What I mean is, this floor is beans. The whole world is beans. How about this then? Would you agree with the statement that videography is the art of illusion? I'm not sure, is that a trick question? Is that a trick answer? Because what I'm looking for is straight answers. Well, I suppose it's all real, isn't it? Correct. Then again, none of it is, because... Because what? Well, it's all smoke and mirrors. Smoke and mirrors, eh? Yeah. Pink queens? Fair enough. So this is for you. Sammy, can you pay attention? At least you got rid of that music from before. Can you put on some proper clothes? These are my proper clothes. Nothing we can do about the music, all right? Get over it. Just grow up. When are we actually gonna put these shelves up, Dad? When you sort this room out. Well if you do the shelves, I'll be able to. I was talking to Roger about it downstairs. He's pondering it. Oi. Oi. Oi. I don't think he'll do it today, though. I mean, none of this is brick. Pretty sure none of it at all. If I tap on it or stick my foot in it, I'll go right through it. Yeah, okay, I get it, it's not brick. But like, there's gotta be another way. Super Glue? I don't know, modern techniques. Super Glue? You don't understand anything, do you? That's bean thinking. That's just bean mind. Bean cognition. Bean, bean, bean, bean, bean, bean, bean. That one's my favourite. Fucking equine excellence. Did you hang that, Rog? Roger? Roger! Mate, none of this is brick, you know. Whoa, whoa, whoa. It's not brick. Go gentle or you'll go right through it. Just, easy. Not brick, any of it. How did you, uh, how did you mount them if it's so fragile? There's a whole art in itself to making something essentially weak and hollow appear to the eye strong and unbreakable. We've mastered it here. Yeah, but how did you actually do it, like actually hang it? That's a Roger question. Roger? Roger! As long as you've got enough goons like Roger around, anything's possible. Not brick. We have all the freaky ones in here. Ones we can't hang upstairs. And my wife's little doodles. I like this one. Freaky, isn't it? I like the freaky ones. This one's fucked. Just a bit. Well, actually, completely fucked the more you look at it. You gotta wonder about people, you know. Sick, mentally sick. Don't you reckon? Some artists, sick fucks. Some people see beauty. Others, trash and filth. It's gotta come down. What do you keep down here? Skeletons, mate. Get up. Don't worry about that. Come and worry about this. So it's dodgy renos, you reckon? What, the walls? Yeah. I don't reckon, mate. Absolutely, absolutely dodgy. You just gotta wonder about some people's mental capacity, their ability, their fucking mental health the way they used to do stuff. Aren't there, laws, you know? You'd think so. You'd absolutely think so. But they just came in and knocked everything down here. They moved the sandstone around, knocked the walls down. Completely trashed the joint. And they did this. Just fucked up. I wonder what it was before. Well, some sorta storage. Probably a larder in the old parlance. Oh, mm, like a butler's pantry perhaps. Yeah, probably more likely a cellar. Well, it's coming down. We're just gonna knock it all down. Bulldoze it. Smash it up. Smash it up, smash it down. Smash it up, nice. Smash it to fucking smithereens, mate. She's a going. Well, it's filth. What? - All this, it's filth. - What do you mean? Well, mate, bit of fucking respect, all right? Just a bit of respect. Give it a little tap. Ow, what the hell's that doing there? - Geez, you all right? - Dad, are we going or what? I've been looking for you everywhere. Well, been waiting for you. I was just showing Ray where he's gonna be setting up. Just so he understands the issues. - Oh, the shonkiness, yeah. - Yeah, the workmanship concerns. Yeah, calm down on that, mate. Come on over here. Just give the wall a little tap, carefully. Tap, get a feel for it. - A bit fucking harder than that. - What am I listening for again? You'll know when you hear it. Come on, harder than that, mate, come on! Can't just be tapping it. Oh! Jesus Christ, what the fuck? I said softly. You said harder. Oh my God, he's drunk. Ow, fuck me dead! Way too aggressive, mate, just way too fucking aggressive. Aggro. I thought he was drunk. I smelled it when he walked in. - Are you drunk, mate? - I'm not drunk. I can smell it. I can smell him from here. - Am I bleeding? - Where? - On my bottom. - On your bottom? - Fucking spiky cunt. - Whoa! Darling, watch your potty mouth. - Just take the beer off him. - Give me the beer, come on. Let's go. Fucking dog. What happened, David? He just punched straight through my fucking wall. Don't you go anywhere. Jesus Christ. Jesus. Feeling generous, guys? Thanks. The building itself was commissioned by William Wentworth. William Wentworth had a young daughter named Fanny, and as they began building, she fell in love. She fell in love with an Englishman, and they spent quite a bit of time together here in Australia, and he didn't much take to the Australian climate, so they actually moved back to England together. Their house was then vacant and rented out to prominent figures at the time. Okay if I join? Sure, we are kind of wrapping things up. - Yeah, no worries. - Okay, no worries. I was just talking about the change of ownership, well, the property itself was being leased out. And so, it lent itself to people who worked in the shipping industry. As you can see, the beautiful water in front of us allowed us to see, as you see the boats passing by, they would come in and dock and so you could see what you needed to in the industry at that time. Yes. I don't know if this is a stupid question. It probably is, but what about the Aborigines? Are they around here or what? No, no, it's not a stupid question. So this area is, um. Celeste. What are you doing? - Hi. - Hi. Sorry, just one second. Miss? That might be the end of the tour. What are you doing here? She's found a friend. We've found friends, too. Raymond, baby, Raymond. How did you get here? Poor darling. How did you know? Well, David's young daughter was swimming around and saw you stumbling up here. She went and told David, and David told Miles eventually. And Miles got on to me through Christian. Oh my God. I know, what a saga. Mate, Jesus, I wish I'd know that you were Carol's son. My wife, Liz, is an old school friend of your mum's. And I went to college with your mum here at Sydney Uni. Can you believe it? Oh, really? Same floor, just down the hall. That's wild. Oh, David, I'm sorry about before. I just totally disgraced myself. Yeah, mate, don't worry about it. Seriously, it happens. Can you sit up? Yeah, yeah, I think so. Just give me a sec. Where's Miles? He's at the neighbour's. What's their names? They're having a big party. Oh, oh yeah. Another beer'd probably do you good, chump. I think we should get you home. - Yeah. - Can you get up? Yeah, I think so. You got it all? Yeah.
