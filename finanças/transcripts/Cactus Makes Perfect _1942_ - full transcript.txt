[♪] [ROOSTER CROWS] [GRUNTING] [GRUNTS] [SIGHS] Hm! Oh. Ha-ha. Oh, my sons: Larry, Moe, and Curly. It's the-- [STOOGES SNORING UPSTAIRS] Get out of that bed, you lazy loafers, and come down and help me! [SNORING RHYTHMICALLY] [SNORING CONTINUES] [GRUNTS] [ALL SNORING] [GRUNTS] What's the idea of rolling over in your sleep? I couldn't help it. MA: Get out of that bed! Hey, Ma must have been trying to wake us up again. Let's go in the bathroom and clean up. I'm gonna brush my teeth. I'm gonna change my socks. What an experience. Ow! Ooh! Sorry. Why, you-- Hm! LARRY: Wait a minute. Hm! What are you trying to do? [PANTS] Aah! Ow! [PINGS] [GRUNTS] What's the matter with you? Hm! Hm! Nyuck, nyuck, nyuck. Oh, well. [CHUCKLES] Where's your razoo? Oh. [LAUGHS] Eee! Eee! Eee! Aah! Ooh! Make like this. Oh-oh! Oh-oh! Oh-ho! Oh. I got a little soap on my tongue. Aah! Aah! Thank you. Thank you. Ow! Ooh, ow! Oof. Oh! Ooh! Wait a minute! Wait a minute! Mm! Open your mouth and say: "Ah." Ah! Mm! MA: Get out of that bed! Hurry up. We're liable to miss our breakfast. Come on. STOOGES: Whoa! [ALL GRUNTING] [LARRY GROANS] Oh! [CURLY GROANS] There's a letter for Curly from the inventors' association. This is personal. Ha-ha. "Dear Mr. Jack." Ah, ha-ha! Look at the way he spells Jack: J-E-R-K. Come on. You don't know how to read. Mm! What's the idea covering my ears? I don't want you to hear what the letter has to say. You-- "After trying your gold-collar button retriever, "I have concluded that it is incomprehensible and utterly impractical." Oh, boy! Success! Success! Success, Mom. Well, just what does this invention do? Wait. I'll show you, Ma. This is my new invention. This is a collar button. I throw it away, and wherever it goes the arrow will find it. Nyuck, nyuck, nyuck. [ELECTRICITY CRACKLING] MA: Aah! Nyuh-ah-ah! Get me out of here! Get me out! Take it easy, Ma. We'll have it out in a minute. Ooh! Oh! I've been scalped. Mm! Oh! Ooh, Ma! [GRUNTING] Bye, Ma. Goodbye, Ma. We're off to the city to make our fortune. Oh, wait a minute. Here's $5 for expenses. Oh, thanks. You would take it. Ooh! Oof! [COW MOOS] Betsy. Goodbye, Ma. Goodbye? You starting that again? [LAUGHS] What are you laughing at? Nyuck, nyuck, nyuck. Oop! Ugh! Betsy. CURLY: What are you waiting for? Come on! Goodbye, Ma. Goodbye, Ma. Goodbye, Ma. We'll miss you. Don't worry. [HORN HONKS] [ALL YELL] [ALL SCREAM] Woo! He almost hit me in the safety zone. We gotta get somebody to buy that gold finder. Did I understand you boys to say you had a gold finder? Why, certainly. Why, I'm the fella you wanna meet. I could sell you the rights to the lost mine. A hundred thousand tons of pure gold, worth $35 an ounce. Think of it. I can't. How much is that in round numbers? [CALCULATOR CLACKING] [BELL RINGS] That's 80 billion, 16 million, and 51 cents and a fraction. Phew. Profit? No. Less income tax leaves us $27. Oh, boy. How much you want for it? I only got $50. I'll take it. Aah! It's a deal. Pay him. Hm! Here you are. Ah. Thank you. He don't know I got another 50. Nyuck, nyuck. Ah, but I got the map, and that'll cost you 50 more. Aah! Pay him the $50. I forget where it is. MOE: Oh, yeah? Oh. Oh. Oh-oh. Ho-ho. Oh, whoa! Oh, it's in his left pocket. Right. Where is this mine? Way out west, boys. Oh, boy. Out west. Where men are men are men are men are-- And they're glad of it. Shut up. Taxi! Pick us up and make it snappy. Out west. Woo-hoo! [ALL CHEERING] [GOLD FINDER FIRES] [BELL RINGING] CURLY: Woo-woo-woo! STOOGES: Gold, gold, gold! Oh, boy. Gold! Gold. Gold. Gold. Gold. Hm. LARRY: Gold. Ohh. [RINGING STOPS] Mm? Tin cans. That ain't no gold finder. It's a scavenger. It's the climate. It's crazy with the heat. How do you feel? Oh, pretty good. Get out. Mm. Nyuh-uh-uh! [GRUNTS] Aah-aah! Heh. Six months on the desert, and all we've got is this little poke of gold. It sure has been tough. Zip. I shoot an arrow into the air. Where it lands I do not care. I get my arrows wholesale. Ha-ha. Come on. Get this thing started. This time you find gold. [ELECTRICITY CRACKLING] [BELL RINGING] Aah! What's the matter? [SCREAMING] Oh, boy. ALL: Gold! Gold! We want gold! Zoot! Come on! STOOGES: Gold, gold! CURLY: I get the-- Yah-ah-ah! Hey, that belongs to me. That's all I wanted to know. Aah, ah! Aah-uh-uh! W-woo woo-hoo! W-w-oo woo! Hey, should I shoot another arrow? Listen, William Tell, for two pins I'd bat your brains out. I ain't got any pins. You haven't got any brains, either. [CURLY YELLING] Aah! Aah, aah! I'm on fire! I'm on fire! I'm stuck! Nyuh! Moe, Larry, help me. I'm-- [YELLING] [GROANING] Come on, get busy. Don't worry, kid. We'll have those out in two shakes and a twist. Come on. [GRUNTING] [GROANING AND PANTING] [YELLING] [GRUNTING] CURLY: Ooh! Ooh! Ow! Ow, ow! Ow! MOE: Hey. You're leaving the ends in him. Well, they don't show. Come on. I'll handle this. Come here. [SCREAMING] [CURLY GROANING] Wait a minute. [GRUNTING] [SCREAMS] Moe, he's got me. Ah! Mm. Hey, what's the idea of the rope? This is my last arrow. You think I wanna lose it? Where it goes, I go. Eenie, meenie, minie, mo. We need gold. Come on, let's go. Make it snappy. [CURLY SCREAMING] Hang on to it, kid. We'll be right with you. Come on. [CURLY SCREAMING] [BELL RINGING] Hey, Moe. [GRUNTING] Hey, Moe. Hey, Larry. Get me out. I'm stuck. Hey, Moe! Hey, Larry! Hey, Moe. Woo-hoo. Lookie here. He thinks he's an ostrich. Get me out! Come on out of there. What are you doing in there? [CURLY GRUNTING] Wait a minute. Grab ahold of his leg. Oh, not-- Oh! Heave. Ooh! Hey, boys. Hey, boys. Not that. Please. Put my legs down. Put my legs down. Mm! Heave. [GROANING] Whoo! Oh, Larry. Hold still. Heave. Ah. This ain't getting us no place. We'll have to blast. Yeah, we-- Wait a minute. Maybe we can pry him out. It'll take longer, but go ahead. Right. Give me a little room. What am I--? Nyuh-uh-uh! [WHIMPERING] Hey, Moe, please-- Heh. Nyah-ah-ah! [SCREAMING] Stop it! Stop it! [WHIMPERING] Moe! Hey, Moe! Hey, Moe-ohhhhh! [GRUNTING] Hm. I think I'm snagged. Yeah, so am I. Boy, oh-- Nyuh-uh-uh-uh! [WHIMPERING] Hey, Moe. Hey, Moe. [GROWLING] Get-- Get off! If I only had my hands free. If I only had my hands free. I better use the other end. [CREAK] [POP] CURLY: Oof! Nyuh-uh-uh-uh! [WHIMPERS] Ow! Ooh! [GROWLING AND MUTTERING] Go ahead, go ahead. Keep it up, keep it up. We can't pull him out this way. We'd better push him through. We'll take him out from the other end. Ready? Right. Heave! Heave! [CURLY SCREAMING] [CRASH] Hello, down there. Hello, up there! Mm. [GRUNTING] CURLY: Throw down the tools! He wants the tools. Come on. Ow! [GROANING] [GRUNTING] Mm! CURLY: Hey, fellas, come on down. Hurry! Come on. There's a ladder here. MOE: Whoa! Why, I'll murder-- Ow! Why, I'll-- You ain't got time. We gotta find the gold. Gold? What are we waiting for? Start digging. Out of the way here. I hope it ain't tin cans this time. Aah! [GRUNTING] [GROWLING] Oh! Ooh! Oh! [CURLY AND LARRY GROAN] Now, put down that shovel and get a pick. Mm! Ooh! I'll murder you guys yet. Sufferin' catfish! They found the lost mine. So what? But they're liable to find the gold. Well, let them do the work, and we'll take the gold away from them. [LAUGHS] I'm gonna work in the corner. Now, you guys get busy. Both of you. [SPITS] [GRUNTING] [GROWLING] Let it go. Ooh! MOE: Oh! Aah! Nyuh. [CREAKING] Ooh! [SOBS] I didn't mean it. Ooh! Oh! Hm! I was-- Nyuh-ah-ah! Mm! [RATTLING] Aah! [CLATTERING] Ah! Gold! We hit the jackpot. Gold. Yeah. Hey, there's more here. The jackpot hit you. I like it. Come on. [CHUCKLING] Boy, won't Ma be happy? Yeah. We'll take her out of the kitchen. And move the stove in the dining room. Let's go. Ha-ha! [LAUGHING] [ALL YELLING] Those double-crossers. Oof! Wait a minute, Moe. Those desert rats are after us. They want the gold too. Where's Curly? I don't know. [RINGING] Did you ring, sir? Yeah. Did you see a guy that high and that wide? Did he have a coon hat on? [LAUGHS] Take it off. Oh! Oh! Oh! Where's the gold? Don't worry. It's safe in the safe. All right. We'll cut it up three ways-- [HOOF BEATS APPROACHING] Shh, you hear something? It must be those guys again. Nyuh-uh-uh-uh! Ah-uh-uh! Where's that gold? Aah! W-w-woo! Woo! Hey, quick. We'll hide in the safe with the gold. That gold's in the safe. Well, give me the dynamite and we'll blow them up. [BOTH GRUNT] Get around it here, you. Where's the gold? There it is. We sure fooled them. Yeah, we-- [SQUEAKING] Hey, what's that? Termites. Yaah! What's the matter with you? I think a termite bit me. Yeah? There she is. Oh, look, a Roman candle. Bzz! Boom! Cuckoo! Fourth of July. Ha-ha. Hey, marblehead. Huh? Do you know what that thing is you're holding? That's dynamite. You mean the things with the--? [YELLING] Look out. Hey, I smell smoke. I'm not smoking.
