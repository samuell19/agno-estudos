Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. [CHIRPING] [SMURFS HUMMING] BRAINY: Don't forget that patch over there, Smurfs. Papa Smurf says to leave no snow unturned. And that one, and that one, and that one, and that one... ...and that one, and that one, and that one-- And-- Cheer up, Brainy. Here's a surprise. [JOKEY LAUGHS] Thanks. Papa Smurf! That's it, my little Smurfs. Get everything Smurf-shape for our Easter festival. [SMURFS HUMMING] Yoo-hoo! Papa Smurf, how do you like our Easter costumes? Aren't they cute? -Hm. They're very cute. -I hate cute. Ah, spring, my favorite time of year. Oh, spring. I absolutely loathe this time of year. Don't you, Azrael? [MEOWING] With its glaring sunshine... ...its stinking flowers... [GROWLING] ...and revolting little forest pests. Shoo! Scat! Go away. But worst of all... ...spring is when those vile little Smurfs are happiest. All these years of their singing, dancing and laughing. Stop it. Stop all that happiness, do you hear? That's an order from me, Gargamel! If only I could capture their miserable, blue hides. But how? For years, I've tried every evil trick I know... ...and still they escape me. Oh, alas, I have no choice... ...but to seek advice from Balthazar. Balthazar. The very thought of visiting him fills me with dread. But it's the only way. The only way. Smurfs, enjoy your disgusting happiness while you can! We'll see who has the last laugh. [GARGAMEL & AZRAEL LAUGH] [SINGING]Looking for Easter eggs [GRUNTING] No, no, no, Clumsy. You don't find eggs under rocks. -Oh, you don't? -Of course not. Oh. [ROOSTER CROWING & DOG BARKING] This is where we'll find our Easter eggs. Oh, boy. Here, egg. Here, egg. Egg-y, Egg-y. [GROWLING & BARKING] You never learn, do you? Let me handle this. [BRAINY & CLUMSY CLUCKING] -Uh-oh. Brainy, your feath-- -Shh. Don't talk, listen. That's how you'll learn. -But, Brainy, your-- -Trust me, Clumsy. Why, there isn't a canine alive I can't outsmart. [DOG BARKING & ROOSTER CLUCKING] Now what do we do, Brainy? Hold me. Let's get out of here. [BOTH PANTING] I think we lost them. Right. Along with our Easter eggs. -What will we tell Papa Smurf? -Oh, Brainy. -Not now, Clumsy, I'm thinking. -But, Brainy. Shh. Eggs, eggs, eggs, eggs. Oh, oh, an idea is forming. A hazy but undoubtedly brilliant idea that will-- -What's wrong with this egg? -This egg? [BRAINY LAUGHS] This egg. Yes. Well, that was my idea all along. Yes, all along. Oh, really? Well, guess that's why you're the brains of the outfit. [STUTTERING] I don't like visiting Balthazar any more than you do, Azrael. But we must be brave. [SCREAMS] Remember, Azrael, be brave. [GASPS] [SCREAMS] Phew. Balthazar! Balthazar. Balthazar! Balthazar-- Ah! Balthazar, it's me, Gargamel. Your only godson. I know. That's why I went easy on you. -Now state your business. -Oh, yes. Well, I-- I want to know how-- How to catch Smurfs. Smurfs? Smurfs? [LAUGHING] Smurfs are nothing but a myth. The only place you'll find Smurfs is in this book. It's full of fairy tales about goblins... ...and leprechauns and Smurfs. It even has a formula for turning lead into gold... ...by boiling six Smurfs. Turning lead into gold by boiling six Smurfs? [CHUCKLES] Oh, of course, that is absurd. And here is a scheme for catching Smurfs... ...by tricking Mother Nature... ...into freezing them out of their village. Oh! Mother Nature. Smurfs. Madness. All superstious madness. Oh, yes. Of course. You're absolutely right. I'm always right. Now be off. I've seen enough of you for one day. Oh, yes. Yeah, of course. Goodbye, godfather. [DOOR SLAMS] [GARGAMEL LAUGHING] And now, I'll not only catch those vile little Smurfs... ...but turn them into gold as well. [SINGING]Oh, I'll fry a few,pickle a few And serve a few real cold Then I'll toast a fewand roast a few And boil six Smurfsfor gold, hey -Clumsy. -What did I do? -Hey! -Oh, gosh, what's going on? Oh, my goodness. It's hatching. BRAINY: Hatching? CLUMSY: Hatching? Oh, isn't he just precious? [DUCK QUACKING] Not bad for a duck. [QUACKING] Oh, poor little ducky. What a terrible way to start your very first day. [PAPA CHUCKLES] I believe he thinks you're his mother, Smurfette. His mother? But I-- [QUACKING] Yoo-hoo! Mother Nature, where are you? Yoo-hoo! Mother Nature. [SQUIRREL SCREECHING & OWL HOOTING] MOTHER NATURE: Oh, me, oh, my, oh my. Every year it's harder to shake the winter chill... ...out of these old bones. Wake up, children, spring is here. That's better. Why, Owl. What's all the excitement? [OWL HOOTING] A visitor, you say? Oh, why, I haven't had a visitor in centuries. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Coming. Coming. Yes? Oh, Mother Nature, I have traveled many, many miles... ...to bring you this humble token of my undying devotion. Oh, how nice. But these don't look like mine. Yeah, but they're almost as sweet. Smell them. [MOTHER NATURE SNIFFING] Oh! What are you doing? [GROANING] Oh, my, I don't feel so well. There, there, Mother Nature. You're under my power now. Oh, no, you'll upset the balance of things. I haven't finished changing the seasons yet. Pleasant dreams, Mother Nature. [THUNDER CRACKING] Azrael, we've done it. We've nipped spring in the bud. Soon, Papa Smurf will come around to see what's wrong. And then... ...I'll be here waiting. [GARGAMEL & AZRAEL LAUGHING] [HUMMING] [HUMMING] Hm. Strange. It almost feels like winter again. Yow! Great balls of smurf. Something is very wrong with the weather. I must call an emergency meeting. [HORN TOOTING] PA: And, this, my little Smurfs... ...is the worst blizzard I have seen in all my 543 years. [ALL GASP] We must take action immediately. I hate taking action. -Handy. -Right here, Papa Smurf. I want a ladder tall enough to reach... ...the lower branches of the Great Oak. Hefty, Clumsy, Brainy and Vanity, smurf him a hand. ALL: Yes, Papa Smurf. Jokey, Grouchy, Smurfette, Tailor and Farmer... ...go to the storehouse and gather what little food is left. ALL: Yes, Papa Smurf. Something tells me we're in for a long winter. -Up we go. -Easy does it. -Watch your smurf. -Look lively, Smurfs. Keep them coming. That's a smurf. HANDY: Heave. Heave. Heave. We did it. ALL: Yay! Oh, Papa Smurf, our village is nearly buried. And our food is nearly gone. And if this storm continues, we'll all be gone. What can we do, Papa Smurf? There is only one who can set things right again. I must visit Mother Nature. Strange. This morning it was spring, and now it's freezing. Something is wrong, very wrong. My book is gone. That thieving Gargamel! But why would he steal a worthless book of fairy tales? Unless they're not fairy tales. Hello? Mother Nature? Mother Nature. Hello? Gargamel. [GARGAMEL LAUGHS] How right you are, Papa Smurf. How right you are. [GARGAMEL LAUGHING] Azrael, get him. Get him. [GROWLING] Azrael, don't let him escape. [LAUGHING] Soon, my vile little Smurfs, I will turn you into gold... ...and become the richest, most powerful wizard in the world. And you and your Papa Smurf will be no more. [GARGAMEL LAUGHING] [GROWLING] [AZRAEL SCREAMING] [GROWLING] [AZRAEL HISSING] [SNORTING] Azrael, let me introduce a friend of mine. [SCREAMING] Thank you, my friend. Now I must return to the village fast. GARGAMEL: Azrael. Azrael. Oh, I can't wait for that fool cat. I have six Smurfs to boil. And then I'll have gold and be rich. Filthy, filthy rich. [LAUGHS] [SINGING]Oh, I'll fry a few,pickle a few And serve a few real cold Then I'll toast a fewand roast a few And boil six Smurfsfor gold, hey PA: Smurfs! Smurfs! Smurfs! Gargamel has kidnapped Mother Nature. ALL: Mother Nature? And six Smurfs. ALL: Six Smurfs? And unless we free Mother Nature... ...the whole forest will remain frozen forever. -What are we waiting for? -Come on. Let's go. ALL: Yeah! That mean old Gargamel. [QUACKING] No, Ducky, you stay. [QUACKING] No, Ducky, stay. This will be too dangerous. No, you stay. [SNIFFLING] [GARGAMEL SNORING] Shh. [GARGAMEL SNORING] Smurf. Harmony, Handy, Greedy, the door handle. ALL: Right, Papa Smurf. GARGAMEL [MUMBLING]: Boil Smurfs. Oh, gold. Lots of gold. Rich. Rich. -Oh, filthy rich. -Shh. -Vanity, guard the door. -Yes, Papa Smurf. [GROWLING] Oh, hey, it's Papa Sm-- [GARGAMEL MUMBLING] Alright, now, hang on. We'll smurf you out in a minute. [SNIFFING] [ALL GASP] Oh, the handsome Smurf warrior guards his post. Look at these steely eyes. That firm jaw. Those stunning whiskers. Whiskers? Azrael! [GROWLING] [GARGAMEL SNORING] Wake up, Mother Nature. Wake up. Oh, Smurfs. [GROWLING] [MUMBLING] Quickly, Smurfs. Quickly. [SCREAMS] [GROWLS] GREEDY: Look out! HEFTY: Gangway! BRAINY: Help! I hate Azrael. Hefty, Vanity, the closet. HEFTY: Right, Papa Smurf. VANITY: Right, Papa Smurf. PA: Now! [MUMBLING & YAWNING] Good work, Smurfs. Now, get out while you can. Hurry. It's too dangerous here. Wait outside with the others while I revive Mother Nature. But, Papa Smurf, we can't leave you here. Smurfette, that's an order. Yes, Papa Smurf. Oh, poor Papa... ...I hope he'll be alright. if Gargamel ever wakes up.... If this doesn't wake up Mother Nature, nothing will. [QUACKING] Ducky, what are you doing here? [GIGGLES] HEFTY: Look. -Someone's coming. -Another human. SMURFETTE: No. It can only mean terrible trouble for Papa Smurf. It's ready. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] BALTHAZAR: Open up, Gargamel! I know you're in there! -Gargamel! -What is--? Where's--? What is--? What is--? [CRASH] Where is my book? I know you stole it. And what of the Smurfs? Are they real? Tell me! Tell me! Smurfs? Real? Oh, of course not. They're gone. My Smurfs are gone. Gone. Gone. Gone. -A Smurf. They are real. -Papa Smurf. Sorry, Gargamel, but I have to run. Stop! Halt! Gargamel, you're a blithering idiot... ...and a disgrace to the family. Now, out of my way. [SMURFS CHEERING] Run, Papa Smurf! -Run! VANITY: Hurry! All I need to make gold is six Smurfs. And it doesn't matter if they're alive or dead. Watch closely, Gargamel. This is the magic wand of the future. It has the power to change the world. [PANTING] Oh, Papa Smurf. Papa. Papa! [QUACKING] Ducky. [GUNSHOT] [DUCK SCREAMING] Papa Smurf! Papa Smurf! -Are you alright? -I'm fine. Fine. But poor duckling wasn't so lucky. Oh. Oh, no. [CRYING] Godfather, that's amazing. -That's-- -Silence. Hear me, Smurfs, and hear me well. I am Balthazar, master wizard. Surrender six of your own to me, or you will all pay dearly. That's right. You'll pay dearly. [GARGAMEL LAUGHS NERVOUSLY] I, well, I-- Here's our answer, Balthazar. Yeah. And here's mine. [HORN TOOTING] [ANIMALS GROWLING] [EAGLE SCREECHING] [WOLVES GROWLING] Oh, no, no. Keep away from me. [BALTHAZAR SCREAMING] [YAWNING] Oh. Oh, me, oh my. Where am I? Mother Nature, this is the house of Gargamel. He put you under a sleeping spell to hold back spring. Hold back spring? Oh, yes, yes. I remember now. He had black roses. Shame on you, Gargamel. You've thrown everything out of balance... ...just for your own selfish reasons. Wait. Hey, what are you doing? Let me go. You can't get away with this, you old-- [GARGAMEL MUMBLING] MOTHER NATURE: There, it's done. Spring has returned. [ALL CHEERING] Mother Nature, can you do something for Ducky? Oh, the poor dear. Well, let me see. There, there, Ducky. Oh. He'll be alright now, Smurfette. Oh, Ducky. PA: Now, that really is something to cheer about. [SMURFS CHEERING] [UP-TEMPO MUSIC PLAYING] [QUACKING] Papa Smurf, this has been a wonderful Easter. Thank you for everything. We were glad to be of help, Mother Nature. You're just lucky... ...I'm not a few thousand years younger, Papa Smurf. [LAUGHS] And a lot shorter. [GIGGLES] JOKEY: Yoo-hoo! Mother Nature, it's for you, Mother Nature. [LAUGHS] It's a surprise. [ALL GASP] Jokey, no! Why, thank you, Jokey. Oh, they're beautiful. [ALL SIGH] Goodbye. Happy Easter. ALL: Happy Easter, Mother Nature. [QUACKING] I hate happy endings. [BOTH LAUGHING]
