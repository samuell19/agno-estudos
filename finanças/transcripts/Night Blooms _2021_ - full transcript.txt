- Smash! - Smash! Smash! - Hey. - Hey. Ok. So, I was thinking, if I'm like, a little bit left of center and then you're on my right. I'm on the left. No, that's my right, if you're looking at it this way. And you're just a little bit back. Ok. I get it. Tyler, get those off! Get out! Out! Mom! Tyler, out of your sisters room. Oh! I am so going to cut that little tongue of yours. Laura, I just got called into work, I really need you to watch Tyler. Laura. Yeah, whatever I'll watch him. Ok. Thank you. I'm going out with Ken after so I might be kinda' late. So you'll have to put him to bed. Sorry Carly, I don't have anything to feed you for dinner. Oh that's okay Lisa, I'm not hungry anyway but is it okay if I stay over though? I can help watch Tyler. Yeah fine. Thank you baby. Who's Ken? Ugh! He's the worst, he's always drunk and they fight all the time. I'm sure it won't last. Ew. That sucks. Yeah, she's pretty annoying. She's always around Jason. It's obvious she has a crush on him but I don't care. Really? Yeah I don't care about Jason, we just fuck sometimes. I don't know, I guess he's my boyfriend. I don't really have a crush on anyone else. Well, I think Jason is pretty cute. Yeah, he's ok I guess. All the guys in our school are immature. Girls actually mature faster then guys, technically we should be going out with guys older than us. Mother Fucker! Actually, wasn't that bad. Tyler! What happened? I scraped my knee. Well, get a band-aid and close the door. You are so annoying. Your turn! Hey. Hey, wanna hit the maintenance shed? Yeah. What? I thought you had a joint. You're such an idiot. No, I'm not. Want some? I don't wanna inhale that shit. It doesn't even get you high. Do you have weed or not? Try it, if you do enough it can get you super fucked up. What. Put your mouth on this for a second? I can't, my mouth is dry. Babe, you're so good at it though. Thanks. Oh, this works too. I swear to god there was a woman there. I swear to god. I seriously can't get over that women. - What women? - In the corner. - You're fucking high. - She was there. No you're fucking high. Laura. How are you? I missed you. Dog face but I'd still do her from behind. Fuck you Matt, you're no fucking prize. Hey Matty! Speaking of dog faces your sister let me cum in her ass last night. Ok, I gotta bounce. See ya. Okay, let's get back before the start of history. What? Schools done, you missed history. What? How long was I in there? I don't know. Seriously I think I had a test today. You need to take more responsibility. Shit. You kind of smell like lavender. It's nice. So, does that stuff gives you a hangover? No, it wore off pretty quick. What about Pineapple girls? Ok, you never like the names I come up with! Because... We actually have to practice. What about Burnt Girls? Burnt Devils? That sounds like a hockey team. Burnt Angels? - I was going to say that. - Yeah? Yeah. Burnt Angel. Like just Angel. - Burnt Angel. - Burnt Angel. - I like that. - I like that too. Sweet. Now we have to figure out like stage props and stuff. So obviously some angel wings. Some fake flowers. Like a banner, a big banner behind us, Burnt Angel. Any luck finding a bass? Nothing my mom can afford. I hope she gets me one for my birthday. I forgot to tell you, that my Dad might be getting me an amp. - What? - Yeah. Like a guitar amp. Yeah. His friend is selling one and we're going to go check it out tomorrow. Did you want to come? Yeah, I would love to. I don't know how you didn't tell me this sooner. We're going to be so good. Burnt Angel. It even looks cool. Right? Like on a banner. Too bad we don't have any songs. I think it'll really pump up the noise. And honestly, it might be to loud for us. Cause it's pretty loud isn't it? You don't need to like it. You gotta do what you gotta do. Hey, can I have a dart Carly? Thank you. I'll get you back, I promise. Yeah ok, Jay. Look, do you want to do me a favor, girl. I got a few things I need to get rid of. Can you pawn this for me? There's a pack of smokes in it for ya. Jay, that shit is stolen? It's not stolen, the guys in there, they know who I am and they just don't trust me that's it. But I promise you this shit right here? No. Not stolen. - I dunno. - It'll only take a second. 2 packs. If I get in trouble for this shit I'm ratting you out. Thank you Carly. - Hey. - Hello. How are you? Good. This is Carly, I was telling you about her. She's the singer of the band. Hey. What's different? Got hair cut? Ears pierced. You got a new TV, it's big! Do you have satellite? You got your ears pierced. I like 'em. Oh, you don't have to take your shoes off we are going to leave now go look at that amp. Okay, thanks for this, Laura's Dad, we're pretty excited. Call me Wayne, and you're welcome. You ready to go? We have to catch him before he leaves. Yeah. I'm just going to put my guitar downstairs. Alright. Hurry up. You want some water or something? I'm good. Thanks. You know my keys... Oh he's got this whole basement too. Mmmm mmm. Alright plug her in. - Oh my God, that sounds amazing. - That sounds really good. You girls want BLTs for dinner? Sure, yeah. Your Dad seems pretty cool. Yeah, he's cool. Why don't you live here then? Mom would never let me. Tyler's dad barely pays child support, so she sort of needs me there I guess. Were they married? Wayne and your mom? Nah, it was just a fling I think. He's actually had issues with drugs in the past. - Really? - Oh it has base and trouble. Here let me see. - Overdrive. - Overdrive. I'm just going to crank the amp up. - Yes. - That's pretty rad. That's even better. I would keep it to a solid ten. That's pretty cool that he stuck aroud when your mom was pregnant. Yeah, he's a good guy. He even asked her to marry him because he thought it was the "right" thing to do... but I guess she wasn't thrilled with his drug use back then. Like the guys she dates now are any better! Thanks again Dad. This was awesome. No problem. And you're coming here to stay next weekend right? Yup, I have to watch Tyler this weekend, but Mom said I can come here next weekend righ after school. Great! It was nice meeting you Carly. Yeah. You too. It was nice meeting you Carly. We could do like echo room. Oh that would be so rad. Ok well I'll see you tomorrow. Yeah, see you. We will be discussing poetry next week. So if you have any poems that you'd like to interpret please bring them in. We also have lots of poetry books in the library. So no excuses! I want everyone have a poem with them ready to interpreted. Miss Tanya. I'm wondering if I could bring song lyrics instead of a poem? Oh, that's a great idea. Well lyrics are poetry too. Are these lyrics ones that you wrote? Oh, no I was going to bring in some Nirvana lyrics. Oh! I thought I heard you say you were doing some writting? Yeah. No, I'm in a band. But our songs are not quite ready to show people yet. Well, that's okay. Definitely bring them in and we will discuss it the way we would any other poem. And I'd love to see your band play some time. Thanks Miss Tanya. Hey, so I think we should work on some music tonight. Yeah, we should. But I'm going to my Dad's. Oh right, that's tonight. I totally forgot. Do you think he would mind if we did it there? Yeah, I guess that should be fine. Do we need to go get your guitar first? No, he picked it up from Mom's earlier. That was nice of him. So your mom said she has a new boyfriend? Ken. He's kind of shitty. Shitty how? Oh nothing he's just like this kid you know. Can I help with anything? Oh no, I'm good. You guys go downstairs and play music. - What you have here is good. - Thanks. This one right here, you should scream it for the chorus. Yeah. Yeah, ok. - Come on. - Like right now? - Yeah. - Your Dad is upstairs. What? How are we suppose to be a real band if you can't even sing in front of one person who isn't even in the same room as you? Ok. But not right now, I'm winning. Oh, sorry I didn't know you were out here. That's okay, are you alright? Oh yeah, I just came out to sneak a cigarette. You want one? No. I'm ok, thanks. So you plant those? Yeah, I don't have much of a green thumb but I've always liked night gardens so I thought I'd give it a shot. Spruce up the place. Night garden? Yeah, most flowers they bloom during the day. These open up at night, they're called moon flowers. What's a girl gotta do to get one of those. That girl would have to be og legal drinking age. I'm 18, I can vote. That should be legal drinking age. You're in Laura's class? I got held back a couple times. Oh my God. Oh my God, that's disgusting. It's near beer. Non alcoholic. Well I didn't even have to be of legal age to drink that! No seriously, that was terrible. Seriously.. Mr. John found me again. That asshole. I could have killed him. How are we suppose to remember all those details. Come on. You won't need school with a body like that, girl. I mean that breath, what the fuck? His wife died last year, she probably killed herself. I would have. - You want to? - I don't know. You want to go at the shed? Nah, I can't. I got a make up test this afternoon. - C'mon it will clear your head. - Yeah ok. Come on Carly. No Jason. Fuck off. What? Why not? Where is she? What? Come on. Why not? Cause I don't want to. Okay, okay, let's go. I think you're done. This guy, Wayne. He's my friend's Dad. Mom, Mom. Let me do that. Go lay down ok. What do you want? Grilled cheese? Yeah. Would you say Dad was a "good guy" when he got you pregnant? As soon as he got me pregnant he split. Landed himself in prison. You know that. But he wasn't trying to leave right? He was trying to be a good guy? He said he was getting me money for the baby but his friend got caught and ratted him out. So your father, so dignified, beat the guy to a pulp with brass knuckles. Fucking fool. He couldn't stand rats though. He's suppose to get out soon right? Like next year or something? He got out a few months ago I think. What? Mom, mom. You say Dad got out already? Yeah. Wanda said she ran into his brother and he said Bobby got out on parole a few months ago. You didn't think he was coming back for you did you? No.Just thought he would want to meet his own daughter. Shit. Hey-can I go over tonight? Yeah. Laura, are you talking through my class? No she wasn't Mr. Johns, I was. Better pay attention or you'll be spending your summer in here with me. Carly, to the Principal's office please. What's that? We have reason to believe you robbed an apartment on Main Street last week and stole some items. Ok. I didn't. What apartment? We know you pawned a game system and some games that were reported stolen just days before. That fucker. I knew that would get back to me. You admit to the robbery, Carly? No. No, uh if I told you someone gave me those games to pawn, would I have to tell you who? Yes, you would. And if I told you it was my game system? You're fucking arresting me? Turn around miss. You have the right to remain silent, you have the right to an attorney, if you can not afford an attorney one will be appointed for you. As soon as we walk out of the office the fucking bell rings, everyone came out into the hallway. They were all staring at me. It's like they planned it like that. Everybody was talking about it. It sounded crazy. And the I had to g et my fingerprint done at the station, which was actually kind of fun. I got a court date next week. Probably get community service. I don't have anything on my record, so... Well, that kind of sucks. Whatever. It was kind of funny. What did Martha say? She was drunk when they dropped me off, I doubt she will even remember. You girls ok? - Yeah were good. - Sorry. Ouch! Was it a good plate? God, I can't wait to get out of this place. Where would you go? Your Dad's? Well, my Mom and Dad were talking and they agreed to let me stay with him for the summer! What? That's amazing! I know and he said we could set the instruments up in the wreck room and we can use it as a jam space. How long have you had these? I don't know? Did you do this to her ears? Did you use rubbing alcohol? Well they'll get infected. That'll be nice. - Sweet! Look at this. - I think that looks good. Right. With some stage light on it. It's going to be badass. You know that song we were working on the other day. With the screamy chorus. Yeah. I think that one's in my other lyric book upstairs. I'll be right back. Mornin' ladies. Mmmm... What's all this about? First official day of summer break. I think that is a reason to celebrate, don't you? Not for me! I got summer classes. It's just science, you'll be fine. Let me know if you need help with any home work or anything, I was decent at science in school. - Yeah, ok. - What is that look? I just don't believe you. Can you even remember that long ago? Don't listen to her. Science was my subject. He likes you. We should play a show at the end of the summer. Yeah? You think we'll be ready? Yeah, I could maybe just sing. We don't need bass. Corey's cousins say he has a drum kit, apparently he's willing to jam. That's cool. You think Wayne would mind if we put a drum kit in here? Probably not. He's really supportive of the band. Yeah, he's really cool. You don't think he minds that I'm here all the time? No, he likes you! How do you know? Did he say something? - Yeah, he said you're funny. - What? When? Just like the other day. He likes having us here. Gives him something to do. When should we have that drummer guy over? Man, this will be fun. Yeah. I don't know, I'll talk to him. Hey. I was hoping I could take you up on the offer to. Oh! Right, of course. Here, sit down. Show me what you got? What you're hung up on? - Right here. - Let's see. You see the difference? Yeah, that makes sense. Once you get the language down it's a lot easier. What are you doing? Hey kiddo, I was just helping Carly with some homework. Cool. I should start dinner, I didn't realize how late it was. - You feel like you got it? - Yeah. Yeah, thanks. Let me know if you need anything else. You wash, I'll dry. Sure. There's dish towels in the pantry. He really does like me doesn't he? I knew it. He might think I'm little young for him though. You're a woman. Seduce him. What ya watching? Just flipping through. What are you doing up? I thought you girls were long asleep by now. I don't know, couldn't sleep. What's this? Bewitched. Oh, no I haven't seen it. So, is she a witch then? That girl? Yeah, that's End or a, she's her mother. And she's upset that Samantha is married to a mortal. It would be kind of cool to be a witch I think. Yeah, I suppose. But the immortal part... I don't know, doesn't sound to fun. No? You wouldn't want to live forever? I don't know, would get kind of lonely after a while? Are you lonely Wayne? What a thing to say. Hey. I think you should go to bed. Yeah, ok. Good night. Hello. Well then. I was wondering if I'd hear from you. You owe me money. She's not here. Yeah, I'll tell her. - You miss me, Bobby? - Fuck you. So when you turn 18 you can apply for what's called a queens pardon, to get this taken off your record. That's assuming you don't have anything else on your record by then. You listen to me? Ok, so what do you got? You got six months of community services... You got... God damn it. Ok, what else? Two days a week at the food bank. That's important. Don't miss any of those days. Check in regulary with your probabtion officer. That's yours. Don't loose that. You got it? Six months of community service at a food bank. So not that bad. Pretty good actually, could be a lot worst. Yeah. I am still pretty annoyed at Jason though. I can't be that mad, you know how greasy that guy is. I should've known better. True. But no matter how greasy he is I wasn't going to rat him out. I wouldn't rat anyone out, I'm not a fucking rat. So Dad's out of prison. Whoa. Really? Are you gonna see him? Dunno. So, I was thinking about making posters for the show! Put some up around town, the diner, here... Yeah, that would be cool. - Hello. - Hey, Wayne? Yeah? It's Carly. Oh hey, yeah Laura's at her mom's tonight. - Oh, gotcha. Hey... - What's up? I wanted to apologize. For the other night, on the couch. I got a carried away and... That's ok. Don't worry about that. It's forgotten. Oh! Forgotten already? I guess girls do that sort of thing to you a lot, huh? No, not exactly. I meant, don't feel embarrassed or anything. Have you thought about it since? I have. That's why I was wondering if you've also been thinking about it. I'm not really sure what you're getting at. You're just so handsome, I get nervous being around you. I guess I got caught up... Looking at your lips. Wondering what they taste like. Do you wnat me to tell you what else I've been thinking about? No, no I don't. Listen... I'm touching myself. Carly, you're in high school and I think you had a crush- Girls have crushes. I'm a woman. I'm into you. Why are you making this such a big deal? How do you think Laura would feel? If she knew that you were doing this? Do you think she would do the same to you if the roles were reversed? Maybe she would just want me to be happy. Yeah, ok. You're welcome to come over here any time with Laura but this flirting is too much. Too much because you can't handle how bad you want me? I'm kidding! Ok, Wayne it's fine, I'm joking! Ok. I'm going to hang up now. Goodbye. Ok. Something like this? Yeah, I like that. Sweet. We're gonna' be so awesome. - Yeah, I hope so. - We will. So I need to talk to you about something. - Ok. - I've been seeing Jason. Ok? No, I've been seing Jason for a while now. I didn't tell you because I thought you would be mad. Are you mad? No. I think that's great actually. Oh. I felt bad hiding that from you. No. You guys fuck all you want. You should! As long as you're happy. I'm happy. We shouldn't done that. Shhhh. Sorry. We can't like you know keep... No talking. Gross. Hello. - Hi Carly, it's Lisa. - Hi Lisa. What's up? Sweet pea, Laura was supposed to watch Tyler and she ran off with Jason somewhere and I don't know when she'll be back. Could you come over and watch Tyler for a few hours? Yeah, yeah I could do that. Sure. You should be together. Hey? What are you doing here? Your Mom asked me to watch Tyler. She said you were out with Jason, she didn't know how long you would be. - I wasn't with Jason. - Are you okay? Well, I guess we will see. How long do you think it has been? Dunno. Four minutes maybe? Shit. Shit. Fuck. It's going to be ok. We'll be fine. Hold on! Are you going to tell Jason? I dunno. What if he wants me to keep it? Do you know what you want to do? Well, I can't keep it. I can't take care of a baby. And Mom wouldn't be any help she can barely take care of us. Ugh, I don't even want to think about what Dad will say. He doesn't have to know. No one does. We can go to the clinic tomorrow and see what your options are. I think Mary's sister had an abortion a few years ago. We could ask her. I don't know if I want an abortion. It's going to be ok. This happens all the time. We'll figure it out. Yeah. - What the fuck? - Sounds like Ken's home. Hey who broke this? Come here you little shit. And he's drunk. Don't leave shit by the door! I told you! Jesus. Hey. You're going to be ok. - Hey. - Yeah. You staying out? Dunno yet. Can I grab a couple? See ya. What did you tell your Mother? Nothing. Just said I was going out. She never ask with who or where or anything. So, do you want to do? We could go get dinner or something? We can't go out in public anywhere, what if we see someone we know? Why did you pick me up then if we can't go anywhere? I wanted to talk to you. Look Carly, I shouldn't have let that happen the other night. Why? I wasn't good? No, God it's not that. It shouldn've happened because it's not appropriate. Hey, no, no. I'm driving here. Wanna go park somewhere and make out? No, cause I'm not in high school. You're not 18. I know you lied to me. Why are you saying that? It came up with Lisa. I know you're 17. Awe Lisa... Are you guys back together? What? You and Lisa seem pretty close, that's all. We're family. Of course we're close. Family? You weren't even married. We have a child together Carly, we will always be family. That's how this stuff works. And that's not the point. I shouldn't let it happen either way. - The age of consent is 16. - What's that? Everyone think it's 18 but it's actually 16. What if Laura finds out? She won't. I won't tell anyone I just like being with you. Let's just take some time alright. Some time to sit with this. Ok? I guarentee you'll see it my way eventually, I know you will. You're so young... Oh my God, I'm not a fucking kid, I know what I'm doing. You know what? Ugh, whatever. Take me home. - I know you're not a kid. - Just take me home please. Alright. - Thank you young sir. Thank you. - Ew. That's so gross. What? It's just drool. Just drool? That's excalty what is so gross about it. You don't know where that kid's been. - I know what I want to do. - What? I just, I know what people will think but I just feel like I should keep the baby. Like, I think I'll be a good mom. What? Is that because of the drool kid? You think you'll be a good mom? Handle a bit of drool? I know it's not great timing but... You're serious? I'm serious, yeah. I think I'll be a good mom. And actually, I've always wanted to be a mom so... maybe now is the time. Yeah. Sure. It's whatever you want. I want to keep it. - Ok. - Ok. - Will you help me tell Mom? - Fuck no. Carly! Watch your mouth. If you think I'm not going to swear around your kid you have got another thing coming girl. Yes of course, I'll help you tell her. Thank you. I should probably do this alone. You sure? I'll totally go in with you. Thank you, but I'll be fine. Okay, good luck. Hello. Laura? Slow down I can't undertand you. Ok. No, I'll be right there. No, I'm not done talking to you yet. Do you have any idea how much this will cost your Mother? - Leave her alone! - You ungrateful bitch. Stop! This is none of your business! Yea, that's right! None of this is my fucking business, do you think I want to be here taking care of all these kids? What, you think I'm the bad guy here, me? And now a fucking retarded baby too! Jesus Christ! I'm not the one who is fucking every single guy in school, getting myself knocked up! You're always fucking taking food right out of your brothers mouth you fucking little slut! Stop it! Hey Wayne, we're just having a little chat here... Get out. Right now. Get the hell out. Don't ever come back. You got it? You fucking people. You girls okay? Lisa, don't ever let him in here again. I know, I'm sorry. Hey, don't be sorry, it's okay. We just can't have him around our family anymore? I'm a bad mom! Oh come on stop! It's ok. Our familly? Why are you even here? I called him. Is this your family now? What's wrong with you Carly? Dad helped us. Is the the baby's okay? Baby? What baby? Oh, sorry I thought you told him. No. Laura? Are you pregnant? Oh my God. Wow! Laura... Does that tickle? Laura. - Knock, knock. - Hey! How was class? Ugh. But after class, I made you a little something. What is this? Oh my god, this is so cute! And tiny, are they really this tiny? - Apparently! - Jeez Louise. So what did the doctor say? Oh, he said everything was good. Looks normal so... Good. I was getting a little worried. A little.. Have you talked to Jason yet? Not yet. Where's Wayne? - I don't know. - He's been out all day? - That is so cute. Look at that. - Yeah, those are cute. Carly, sweetie. Hey, sweetie. Hi... Where were you? I was at a meeting. Why are you on the couch? I wanted to see you. - Where's Laura? - She's asleep. Come on, let me drive you home. I wanna stay here. I'm sorry. Sorry for what? The way I acted when you picked me up the other night. I was afraid of losing you. It's ok, come on let me drive you home. Why can't I just stay here? You can't sleep here every night Carly. Why are you so hot and cold all the time? I just don't think you should be here every night, that's all. - Were you with Lisa? - What? No. Are you seeing someone? Lower your voice. Hey. Hey... Hey, where's Laura? At the venue. I was suppose to be driving both of you guys. Oh no, I told her to wait there after sound check and I would meet up with her after. I'm so stoked to play this show. I hope there are a lot of people there. I'm wondering if if opening band is any good? Corey has seen them and said they were pretty good. I haven't seen them but I mean, we will probably be the best band there. - You did this one purpose. - What do you mean? Oh come on. Just for me to drive you. I said I would drive both of you, together. Oh yeah, yeah. I just said she should stay at the venue because somebody had to work the door. And I had to go home and change. Look Carly, I'm going to say this to you one more time and you got to hear me. This can't go anywhere. Do you understand? Yeah, this about Lisa. No. God damn it, it's not about Lisa! Then someone else? No that's not what this is about. - Stop yelling. - We can't see each other. I don't feel good. I don't want to hurt you. But you don't seem to be hearing me. I can't lose you. Lose me. Carly we're not a thing. I don't feel good. Carly, wait! Carly wait! I don't wantt to see you right now. Carly, please. Just relax, it'll be okay. Carly, get back in the car. I know you're upset. I don't do this. I can't believe this. I love you so much... I would never do this to you. God damn it! Carly! Carly, get back in the car, I'll still give you a ride. I'm going to play my show, don't come! Where's Carly? I am gonna go find her. Have you seen Carly? You guys seen Carly? No we haven't seen her. Carly! Carly! Carly! Are you okay? I'm so sorry Laura. It's ok, we still have time to go play our show. Wow, pathetic. I don't know why he doesn't love me. - Who? Jason? - - I'm so mad. Are you upset about Jason? Guys! Guys, something's wrong with Carly. She's just high Laura, it'll wear off soon. No, It's something else, she can't breath look at her. Oh shit! She's fucked up! What did she take? I don't know. Maybe this? She smokes this sometimes. Jesus Christ! You're lucky she's not fucking dead. Should we take her to the hospital? Yeah, probably. Ok no, she doesn't need a hospital, she's just high. It will wear off soon. Alright, well I can't risk this shit, I'm on probation. I'm gonna bounce. - Matt! - I am gonna bounce! I can't Laura, I am sorry. Jason what the... Matt! Somebody help please! What happened? I don't know. I think she needs to go to the hospital, she can't breath. Okay, bring her to my car. Aerosol? Yeah, a can of air freshener. I think she was inhaling it. I don't know, some kids at school do it. I can't get a hold of her mom. How is she? Okay Carly, how many fingers? This is his fault... I need you to put this mask on. Wayne. Wayne, I told him. I don't why she keeps saying his name. That's my Dad. Carly, he's on his way. He'll be here soon. What? No, no, no... He told me he loved me. He loved me. What happened with Wayne Carly? He fucked me. Hey. What happened? Dad, what the fuck did you do? - Hey. - Can I help you, Carly? I just haven't seen Laura around since school started. Wanted to see how she was doing? She's tired and morning sickness so... Just going to keep her home a while longer. I got her a present. If she's up for a visitor? She's really tired, sweetie. But when she wakes up I can give it to her if you want. Wait Lisa. I'm sorry I messed eveything up for you guys. You didn't do it alone. He's a grown up. He knows better. It wasn't like that. Sweetheart, you made a little girl's decision and you are paying big girl consequences but it's not... People are quick to judge but you did not do this alone. It sure feels like it. You're alone. He is being made accountable too. But he's Laura's dad. We're a family and we got to do what it takes to stay close. Yeah no, I understand. Hey. I was wondering when I'd see you again. I lost him and I lost Laura, I don't know what to do. If you gave him a baby, you would be part of the family. Why did you stop? Finish inside of me. You can't be here. You hear me? You can't be here. Hi.. Let me come in. What? No, absolutely not. No! Yeah, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I.. I love you! I can't see you Carly, do you understand? I can't see you! And I'll be 18 soon. I fucked up. I know I fucked up. I lost everything! You understand? I don't know what I was thinking.. Look, I fucked up and I've lost everything. Laura won't answer my calls. I'm drinking again. I can't even walk my own fucking block without the neighbors looking at me funny. - I'm pregnant. - What? No, I'm sorry. I'm not pregnant. I'm not. Jesus Christ! I'll give you a baby if you want one. I have a child and she won't speak to me because of you. I don't want a fucking baby with you. I don't want anything with you. Nothing! I know I'm the adult in this situation and... I messed up and this isn't your fault. No, you didn't do anything wrong, I love you. I have to be responsibility. You understand? Look at me. If you don't leave right now I'm going to call the police. No. No, please. Wait... I have nothing left to lose, kid. What's wrong now? No. I do not want to see you right now. I ran into Shelley at the liquor store today. Yeah? How's Shelley doing? She blamed me for what happened between you and that man. She said everyone in town is talking about how I let you do whatever you want. How I don't set boundaries. Hey, hey Mom. It's okay. No! It's not. Everyone I know thinks I'm a bad Mother and I just don't know, Carly. You've always been so independent and I've never really had to raise you. You raised yourself. And I was doing it alone, and... Mom, look at me. You're doing a fine job. I'm going to be ok. She never even asks about you. What? So she's not perfect. She's not perfect. But she's the only... she needs me. She needs me. And at least she stuck around. And at least she stuck around. Dad never took.. ...responsibility Responsibility You don't make me feel good. I think you should go away. Bobby called. He wants you to call him. If you want to. But don't feel obligated you don't owe him anything. Hi. It's Carly. I would really like to see you in person and talk. If you're feeling up to it. - Hey. - Hey. - Can you forgive me? - Forgive you? Carly, it was Dad's fault. No, I need to take some responsibility. I was being so selfish and I didn't think about how it would affect this... It's just weird for me. I don't want to think about it. And I'll accept that you made some bad choices but you have to accept that I just think we should see each other for awhile. And I don't blame you. I'm not mad at. But it's just so weird. You understand that, right? Do you want to yell at me? You can yell at me if you want to. I don't want to yell at you, Carly. Will you at least call him? That's not your business. Take care of yourself Carly.
