A gear is not spinning at the correct speed. It should run at 1730, I hear it at 1680. -Do you hear a difference of 50 Hz? -I see her too. There, this line at 1680 Hz. -Pitchez 300% towards the low end. * More serious blade rotation ... We hear a break of dawn. It's the anti-couple. -I am not sure. Should do a test flight. Film under the same conditions. - Listen, Mathieu, I know this kind of accident and the video speaks volumes. -Sorry, I think a test flight is really necessary. -You would have spent time and means for the same conclusions. -Since you say so. We'll never know. -I give the file to Balsan? Good... The door closes. Telephone and hectic discussions ... -We need the avionics system. -The go-team will be there at 3 p.m. Phone -Call for flight safety. -The serial number flight recorders... - Sorry, we're canceling, we have a crash. - We have to free the lab. -Ok I wait. Alright, I'll wait. Crash in the Alps of an Atrian 800. 300 passengers. -When ? At the moment, according to air traffic control. -All the technical doc. New plane and engine, everything. Forward to Pollock, it is the investigator. - Who leaves ? -Renier wants a CVR in addition to Pollock and a wrecker. Yes. I also need the name of your technical advisor. The go-team leaves as soon as there is a theft. -Balsan, take your things. Let's go. -It is always me who accompanies you. -Balsan is also competent. -If it's for later... - I don't have time to deal with your moods. -The intervention case. - What ? - The suitcase. You have it. Vibrator ... ... -Yes ? * -Do not do the blow, you come. -I don't know what time I'm going to finish, so... * -Every time, I do the forcing.

Hubbub ... Tinnitus ... Sound muffled ... -they act as if nothing had happened, but they think that in the crash. - I'm not on it. -Enough to ? -The investigation, I'm not on it. It's the deal of the decade and I'm not on it. -If it's a failure, Atrian dives and I'm on the floor, like half the room. We're at the Titanic bar. - Xavier! - Oh ! - How are you ? - I'm fine and you ? -Pegasus will secure the Roissy network? -Yes, it's a big job. -Your single network fiber is awesome. Why don't we want it? -It makes the devices less heavy and less greedy. -We can discuss it at noon. - Next week, if you want. - Perfect. I call you. - That works. -He, couldn't he supervise you? -I had no friends and there they give me all their CVs. - What are you up to? - I was going to ask Mathieu how you managed to drag him here. How are you ? - Yes. - When do you start with Varins? - Next month. I'm happy. Thanks again. -It was a phone call. Is the agency talking about you going into the private sector? -They'll get over it. -You know they are losing their best element. -I'm going to have a lot of work. Varins is building up the pressure. - No, you'll be fine. - I hope. I organize an afterwork for gender equality. I would like to invite the entrepreneurs club. - Do I tell them about it? - It would be good. - I'm just doing him a favor. - Stopped. -I'm joking. I will do it. I have to see the guys from Safran. I'll call you and we'll see you. - That works. Have you finished your turn? - Yes. -So ? -The debris is not widely dispersed. -So, no explosion. Were you able to have access to the trajectory? -The aircraft stung quickly. - What about air traffic control? - They wanted to gain altitude and ATC lost contact. - Do you have a technical problem? -No, I took part in the 800 certification, it's a Rolls. There has never been a major failure. * - Little is known about the crash of the Atrian 800 in the Alps. * While the gendarmerie is active * in this high mountain area, the BEA experts * were dispatched to locate the black boxes... He cuts the radio off. -Stop dwelling. You're not on it, you're not on it. I already told you that you have nothing to gain by pissing off Pollock. - Am I supposed to crash? - Honey, we don't just judge people on their skills. Be more conciliatory. Go ahead, it's green. I learned that in a coaching seminar. "Reboost an employee in distress". He's laughing. - You have no mercy. -No None. * -The aircraft, a European Airlines Atrian 800, was carrying * 300 passengers and 16 crew members. * There would be no survivors. Flight EA024 had taken off * at 1h40 from Dubai to Paris CDG, arrival 8h50... - Take. - Thank you. * - Shortly before 8 a.m., the plane lost altitude and crashed * near Bellevaux in Haute-Savoie for reasons we do not know. * A rescue operation was immediately launched... -Victor Pollock, investigator at the BEA investigative office.

Delay. Delay. -Output of reverses. * Beeps ... On a wet track, the long landing and late reverses caused the exit. The crew should have made a go-around before touchdown. -10 min to incriminate a pilot who is not there, it's a bit easy, isn't it? -We reproduced what happened as best we could. -It has nothing to do with being in mid-flight. -Mr. Roussin, your colleague said that the device had reacted badly, but it is not true. -Continue and the planes will be flown like drones. -Think what you want. -We are judged by people like you. Frustrated pilots. -Recommendation: review landing procedure on short track... Ringtone Yes hello ? * -Mathieu, I must see you. - Sorry, Balsan is alone? -Pollock is still not here. Unreachable since this morning. -OKAY. -Yes, come in. I'm sending you a copy of the CVR, but I had to talk to you. Because there have already been leaks, assure me that this information will be kept confidential. Very well. Mathieu, we have a problem. We haven't heard from Pollock. Balsan is not doing it, audio is degraded. You have to help him. -Very well. The FDR gave what? -It is almost unusable. There were inconsistent orders in the last few minutes, but we do not know why. The phone is ringing. Yes ? * -I have the Minister's cab dir cab online. - Give it to me. Yes ? I know the urgency, but I need time. We analyze the CVR. No, 3 p.m., that's impossible. OK, 7 p.m. I agree to it. I keep you informed. Press conference tonight at 7 p.m. Make the CVR talk. I need the exact sequence events. Tension music ... -We treated the 1st hour, the rest is raw. The cockpit microphone is super dirty. * -European 24, Swiss control. -Stop. - What ? - There's a buzz. Unplug the gate. OKAY. * -European 24, are you able flight level 400? * -Stand by, we call you back. * -We are at 251 tonnes. *-Its good.

We cannot determine their actions, push-buttons and selectors are tactile. -We need to know how he got in. -It's impossible. Did you see the recording? -I can't delay the conference. Will it be okay, Mathieu? - Yes. We will get back on RX, at 7:51. *Registration ... -The debris being in a restricted radius suggest that the plane was whole before it hits the ground. This is corroborated by analyzes of the fuselage which indicate no trace of explosive. In addition, the conversation recorder revealed the intrusion of a passenger in the cockpit. Whispers A fight would have followed with the pilots. -PLEASE ? -Yes ? -Good evening. Caroline Delmas for Mediapart. How does a passenger could enter? there are 3 cameras above the door. -The individual would have benefited from the entry of a hostess. -What elements are you basing yourself on? -On the analysis of conversations. I leave our investigator, Mathieu Vasseur, you present the first lessons of CVR. Clicks ... -Good evening. On... On the recording, at 7:48 am Paris time, we hear the voice of the hostess entering the cockpit to give the first meal tray. She comes back 1 minute and 20 seconds later and request the opening again. Surely for the second plateau. The pilots identify her and let her in. The door is still open and thanks to the ambient microphone between the pilots, we hear hurried footsteps in the direction of the cockpit. These steps differ from those of the hostess. There, we can say that there is an intrusion into the cockpit. A few seconds earlier, we isolated the sound of the latch from the pilot toilet door. These toilets are... here. The individual hid inside before rushing into the cockpit. The hostess should have checked this room before requesting the opening. These are our deductions after analyzing the recorder. I hope I have answered your questions. Thank you. -Then we hear overspeed and ground approach alarms. -Please ? -Yes. -Antoine Istier for Europe 1. Is it a terrorist attack? -In all likelihood. An ongoing judicial investigation will deliver its conclusions. The complete transcript of the CVR will be the subject of a report which will be presented to you. Thank you. Thanks, Mathieu. Hubbub ... -You identified the terrorists? -We can't say more. -Mr. Vasseur, Caroline Delmas for Mediapart. A question. -No comment. -Excuse me... Everything is based on negligence on the part of the hostess. It's light, isn't it? -No, that's what the CVR reveals. I analyze the facts, that's all. Sorry. Soft music ... * -This advance in the crash of the Atrian 800 in the Alps. * According to our information, an Islamist individual * was among the passengers. * It would be Moqtada Sualazi, a 26 year old Egyptian. * Yesterday, the BEA investigators revealed following a first analysis * black boxes as the crash * would be linked to the intrusion of a passenger in the cockpit... -Mathieu! Congratulations again for your intervention. - Thank you. - In view of your very good work, I appoint you chief investigator. -But... Thank you very much, sir. Thank you. Excuse me, but... Any news from Pollock? - Not yet. In 10 years, Victor has already been unreachable, but his absence in such a storm... I do not understand. I can't wait for it. I am counting on you to finalize the report. -Sure. Intriguing music ... The phone is ringing. Yes. * -Mathieu, it's Julien. * Are you replacing Pollock on Dubai-Paris? -Yes. * -The husband of a victim * received a message from his wife before the crash. Are you interested ? -I'm doing the transcript. Send to Balsan. * -it is not free. He's with Atrian's engineers. -OK, I take. * -Following a search of his home in Cairo, * Jihadist propaganda videos were found on his computer. * The controversy swells, Paris wondering * how the Emirati authorities were able to let him embark. * - Honey, it's me, I'm on the plane. * I don't know what's going on. * It's a mess, everyone is screaming. * Crackling * I... I see mountains. She is sobbing. *I love you. * I love you, can you hear me? * Tell the girls I love them. I like you a lot. *I love you. * Engines speed up. Silence -She had gone to Dubai... for an interview. If it worked, we had planned to settle there. When she... When she called, I... I was at work. I was working instead of talking to him. -Excuse me, Mr. Reynal, but I would need to recover the original post. I'd have to borrow the phone. It's the 24 hour business. Soft music ... *-You have a new message. October 8 at 7:56 a.m. * - Honey, it's me, I'm on the plane. * I don't know what's going on. * It's a mess, everyone is screaming everywhere. *I... *-You have a new message. October 8 * at 7:56 a.m. * -Darling, it's me, I... -Three minutes? - Yes. - Remember Germanwings. Between the DGAC, the company, the Flight Radar and the other sites, no one agreed on the schedule. We had 8 minutes of difference. -I know, but there is that, too. Wait, listen. * -Darling, it's me, * I'm on the plane, I don't know what's going on. * Ringtone * It's a mess... - There is the ringtone preceding an announcement. She comes from the cockpit, but it is not on the flight recorder. - You don't hear it. Considering the state of the CVR, it is possible. - Yes Yes. Wait. One last thing. Right here. * -... shouts everywhere. *-Emergency. * -... shouts everywhere. *-Emergency. -I hear "emergency descent". As if they had a technical problem. -Make me listen again. I don't hear "descent". European Airlines, you have checked their security protocols? In the event of an intrusion into the cockpit, the key phrase is "Delta urgency". The "d" could correspond to that of "Delta". -Uh... -Continue on the transcript. * -Last passengers evacuated. -58 seconds. Your device is officially certified. Applause ... -Thank you. ... Thanks everyone. * Beeps * -Jeanne comes back, I open. *Opening * Indistinct exchanges * -European 24, Swiss control, say altitude. ... -How are you ? Are you going to talk? -No, it's informal. Dorval will say a few words. How are you ? -Yeah. -You have the right to relax. You can take a cup, chat a bit. I'll introduce you Varins. Claude... I present to you Mathieu, my husband. - Hello. - Hello. - I followed your intervention. It was clear and rigorous. Well done. -Thank you. Thank you. -Without making a takeover bid on your couple, if you tire of the BEA, you will be welcome to Atrian. -He is indebted. -It was a vocation to work at the BEA? - Uh... - Initially, he wanted to be a pilot. - Yes. But with my sight... At ENAC, I specialized in acoustics. I was made to listen to recorders flight, I found it fascinating and... And There you go. -Fascinating, but also tedious to provide answers. - You did it. Well done. In a moment like this for families and everyone else, this is crucial. I will introduce you to the management of Safran, you will collaborate. Excuse us. - Sure. Vibrator Hello ? * -It's Samir. * I gave you the passenger data. - It's interesting ? * -Facebook photos and videos posted during the flight. -OKAY. OK, thanks. Feedback -Hello everyone. Congratulations to all the teams for this certification. I take this opportunity to say hello to Noémie Vasseur, of whom this is the last, since, unfortunately for us, she leaves us at the end of the month for the sirens of Atrian. Noémie, thank you for your commitment, for your passion, and I can say, in the name of all the collaborators, that we will miss you. Thank you.

Sir ? Please be seated. Sir ? - Be careful not to overinterpret, Mathieu. It's already arrived. You want to do well, but by dint of filtering and equalizing, we say what we want on recording. I did 20 years of CVR analysis, believe me, the best filter is the ear. -You read about the meal cart? -You sincerely think that a cart prevent a madman from hijacking a plane? - No, but... - Concentrate on what we hear. I await your report on Monday. -Yes. Excuse me, but it would have taken me Pollock's opinion. I can't wrap up the report like this, no. -You will have to do without. His disappearance has been reported. Investigation police station was opened. They do not rule out any leads. I'm not hiding from you that we're worried. * -We considered * a Turkish company, but with the crash, the Germans were * more finicky. - Did you decide? * -No, we set up a working group. *What's the matter ? - I doubt the crash. There are inconsistencies. * - Inconsistencies? - It's complicated to talk about it, but it's... there is a problem with the CVR. * -How's that, a problem? - I'll tell you about it. I'll tell you about it. * -It's a big deal. * Keep a cool head this time. * Crackling ... * -Victor Pollock. Leave a message. Intriguing music ... -Why was he entrusted with the investigation? He heard phantom sounds again. - Or sounds you can't hear? - Think what you want. He remakes the shot of the Cessna. ... *Registration ... - What are you on? -The Falcon 20 at Le Bourget. I have that audio between the pilot and the tower. Reduced bandwidth, it's complicated. What do you want ? - Tell me, the night you listened to the CVR with Pollock, haven't you noticed anything abnormal? -Nothing in particular. - What time did you finish? -Me, midnight. Him, I don't know. Why ? - You do not know ? Did you finish earlier? - Yes. He was on edge, he wanted to continue alone. You've finished ? I must move on. ... -In the 1st exchange, there is a thud. Without a doubt a bird. There is a rise in power beyond the limits, nearly 200%, before the explosion. The engine manufacturer won't believe you, but tell him we've had this type of incident before. Intriguing music ... * -Continue * over 50 m. ... * You have arrived at your destination. ... ... ... Barking ... -Sit! Sit! Seated. Looking for something ? -Sorry ? - Looking for something ? - Yes. Victor Pollock. Is this his house? -Yes. So what ? -I work with him. I rang, no one answered. Did you not see him? -Not for a while. Your colleagues came by yesterday, he wasn't there either. -Okay. Ok thank you. ... Intriguing music ... * Pollock is breathing heavily. ... ... Call ringtone -Hello ? * -M. Vasseur? * Caroline Delmas from Mediapart. * We saw each other at the conference. - Where did you get my number? * -You have studied automation concerns? -I do not speak to journalists. * -A month from Le Bourget, a failure would be unwelcome, right? Horn * Mr. Vasseur, are you there? *Hello ? -I must leave you, bye. ... ... Intriguing music ... -Take. Theft reports. What are you looking for ? -Looked. One again. On a Paris-Washington, this concern for governance. 3 identical incidents in 6 months. There have been reports of jerks and lag times. Do you have the maintenance reports? - I brought them. Take. -The 800 could have a problem of commands? -I do not think so. -The MHD is an anti-stall system? -Yes, it lowers the nose if the aircraft rears up too much. -A concern of the MHD would do what? Can pilots override? - No, there's no reason. It is reliable. - Have you tested the Dubai-Paris one? - Why ? We know what happened. - Did you get it back? - Not yet. - I need it checked. - OKAY. -Samir... Samir. Excuse me for asking you that, but tell Rénier nothing. -I hope you know what you do. -Mr. Roussin? Mr. Roussin? Hello, Mathieu Vasseur. We saw each other in simulation, the runway excursion of the EM315. - I have a flight. -I'm investigating Dubai-Paris, I have a few questions. -No, I don't have time. - I understand that you do not want to answer me, I need you. You reported steering problems on the 800. Could it be related to a failure of the MHD? -Why ask me that to me? Go see Atrian. The BEA gets along well with them. If you want to excuse me, I will be expected in 5 min. -You were more talkative in defending your colleague. there were 300 deaths. -It's a stupid system, like Atrian. The pilot is subjected to the machine. I have already explained that to you. -I am ready to listen to you. Give me 5 min. -The aircraft was marketed too early. Atrian wanted to catch up with his rivals. -They have closed their eyes to this assistance problem? -Qatar and India had signed. With penalties of a billion dollars, we advance our pawns. -The certification commission checked them. -Are you so naive? It is the flagship of European aeronautics. Imagine his influence. Claude Varins, do you know? He has connections in the commission. Intriguing music ... -Alain! The Cabin Crew Members are on board. -I go. -We must meet again. -I will contact you again. ... -I'm going back next week. I leave, so they charge me like a mule. -What's this here ? -A study group to regulate drone traffic. - Did you know about the 800 steering concerns? Pilots revealed anomalies 6 months ago. Have you seen any on the certificate? -It concerns your investigation? -I would like you to answer me. -It's ridiculous, Mathieu. Do you think the device has a problem? There were latency issues, but they've been fixed. -Why do pilots claim to have lost control? -These are fantasies. This system helps them, it does not replace them. Which pilots are you talking about? Those against automation and video in the cockpit? To keep their habits, they will say anything. Do you think the agency would approve a failed plane? We were picky and Atrian followed our directions. Started. -Yes, you work hand in hand. -You mean what? -These tests, was there a report? -OKAY. Forget. I should never have told you about it, it's confidential. -You did have a report. -It's confidential. You are annoying me. Started. Start, I'm telling you! - Are you coming back to that? - I want to test the MHD. - Mathieu, the facts are true. These are your conclusions. -I... I know. -The MHD went to a warehouse in La Défense. -Why the Defense? -The case is sensitive. They get the avionics system back, it's under seal. -On your order, we could recover the MHD. -I won't do it without something tangible. Resume your current files. Where is the Dauphin crash? I await your conclusions. *Tone * -It is Alain Roussin. Leave a message. -Yes, it's Mathieu Vasseur again. You told me we could meet. I need to talk to you. I'll let you remember. * -It is Alain Roussin... *Tone * We pick up. -Hello ? * -Stop calling me! * I don't want to see you. -I do not understand. * -Don't call me anymore, is that clear? -We had agreed... Hello? *He hangs up. -I heard things about you. They say you harassed a pilot and doubts the reliability of the 800? -Who we" ? Is it Noémie? -The commercial director of European. Do you think we're talking about you? Do you want to get fired? Think of Noémie. She will occupy a sensitive position. She needs you and you are looking for conspiracy theories. I say that as a friend. I don't want you to grill yourself. Where did you get that from? -In 3 years, you never told me that you knew Pollock. -He intervenes in my working group. - What are you working on? -A beacon system that would locate a device permanently. Why are you showing me this? -I dunno. Pollock disappeared two days after the crash, I find that weird. - Does that make me a suspect? - I did not say that. - Suspect of what? It's absurd. Why are you doing this to me ? Because I get along well with Noémie? You really need to relax. You put your head up. We know what happened. Admit it. Tinnitus How are you ? ... -I go. ... * -This new day placed * under the sign of emotion. * 10 days after the Atrian 800 attack, * the entourage of the victims * participated in a commemoration near the crash site. * The families were accompanied to the scene of the disaster * and were able to speak to representatives of the authorities * as well as with the judge in charge of the investigation. * Journalists present were kept away. * No new information was communicated to them. * According to the judicial authorities, * a press conference will be held soon. * The journal continues. ... Intriguing music ... -We could make a restaurant, that would do us good. We're on edge. -Especially you, right? -I admit. -Where do you want to go ? - Shall we go back to Matsuda? It's been a long time and then, you like it. -Yes why not ? -Tomorrow evening ? -Tomorrow night, I can't. I'm going to finish late. I am finalizing the drone report with Isabelle. Thursday, if you want. -Yeah, Thursday. OK perfect. Suspense music ... - How did you get this document? - You wanted proof. -You have interest to be right. ... -Most pilots aren't sufficiently qualified. We have seen premature descents from crews using this system. -To minimize this risk, I recommend the "3D" procedures. -We hope that by using this satellite guidance system, we can reduce noise pollution by at least 15%. -Solignac appointed project manager at Atrian. It just fell, it's official. ... -Claude, what is this affair with Solignac? * -The situation has changed. - How so ? I do not understand. * -You can only blame yourself. * You have disappointed me extremely. *I must leave you. The phone is ringing. -Yes ? * -You are invited to the Vauban room. -We wanted to evoke an accident which puts the agency in a delicate situation. I received a very rude call from the manager of Atrian. He accuses the agency of having disclosed confidential information. Do you see what I'm talking about ? -No. - A lifting of seals has been requested on the Dubai-Paris. It comes from the BEA and is based on the report of the first test. It was signed electronically. It comes from your computer. Do you realize the gravity of the facts? It should never have been disclosed. -You did not respect the confidentiality clause. It is a serious fault. You are laid off. -I am not responsable. -You will be able explain it to you. A disciplinary committee will meet. -Give me back your computer. -You can't... -Thank you, Noémie. That's it. Soft music ... -Dorval summoned me. I am laid off for serious misconduct. How could you do this to me? -I am sorry. It shouldn't leak. - Do you realize? I'll be fired. - I didn't know it was going to come out. I needed the document. -Why ? There was an attack. You heard it. - I didn't hear that. I heard inconsistencies! It's bullshit ! We put Salafist videos on some guy's computer. This is what is happening! Whore ! - You're crazy ! -Me, am I crazy? Your dinner at Varins... Why are you lying? - What ? - Why didn't you tell me? -Exactly, to avoid your paranoid crisis! I was afraid that you would do a scandal in front of Varins, for me, for my job! - Do you hear what you say? You should have asked yourself the real questions! I asked myself! Atrian accelerated the 800 certification when he was not ready! I don't know if you closed your eyes or participated. - You're sick. -There were 300 dead! We owe the truth to families. -Stop telling me about families. You did it for yourself. To prove your delusions! Crash Intriguing music ...

Stall. -That works. It reacts normally. - Start again. The first test. Go ahead. Redo. There is a problem. - Mathieu, we understood... - There's a problem. It's not normal. Go ahead, raise.

You're not gonna stay here all day. Theo wants to go to the park. Are you going with her? -Maybe, yeah. * -Order books should be full and Atrian could become the leader... - Any news from the BEA? - I'm called in on Thursday. - You have to explain it to them. Tell them what you went through. You worked day and night... - Stop, Pauline. I messed up. I messed up, there's nothing more to say. You know what ? He was right, actually. -Who is that ? -Him. Not good enough to be a pilot. Nor to be an acoustician. Soft music ... Vibrator ... Hello ? * -M. Vasseur? -Yes. * -Hello, I'm Laura Saunier. * Philippe Reynal gave me your number. * My son was on board the Dubaï-Paris. * His name was Lucas. *I have... * I need to understand what happened. -Excuse me, I am no longer working on this investigation. * -M. Reynal told me you are a good person. * Crackling * I would like to know if he understood... ... * If he understood he was going to die. ... * My son was sitting in seat 27B. -Hello ?

Intriguing music ... -Come in. Come in, come in. How are you ? - Yeah. -Sorry, I have little time, Air China will arrive in 5 min. Do you want something to drink? -No thanks. -Sit down. Are you okay? You wanted to see me ? - Yes, I need your expertise. - What about ? -Your company secures the networks of Atrian devices? -Yes. -How is the 800 better protected against cyber attacks? - Why ? - You are better placed to know that it's hard to make the piloting and communication systems watertight. Can we imagine that we enter and reach the navigation system? -It's unlikely. -With the exchange of data, the wifi on board, it creates loopholes. What hackers could exploit? -Yes, it's our job to fix it. -On the entertainment network, a clever one cannot interfere with the piloting system? - Impossible, there is a separation between the 2 systems. On one side, the passenger cabin, on the other, the cockpit. Separate networks. -At the ENAC evening, you were not praising a single network fiber? -Networks can be separated by passing through the same cable. Do you know your computer or not? What are you getting at ? Dubai-Paris has been hacked? -Yes. As the network manager, you have been warned. - Yesterday, an assistance problem, today, a hacking. Tomorrow what? Every day, will you change your theory? You analyze recordings, you don't develop theories. -I analyzed the CVR, Pollock tampered with it. He was alone from midnight to 2 a.m. You asked him to. - I don't know what to tell you anymore. You are pathetic. If you don't mind, I have a job. -Xavier Renaud would have ignored a flaw of the 800? -Modifying a line of code costs 1 million and it takes a year to enforce it... Yes. We could not delay its marketing. -May be, but we have no proof. The only case of attempted hacking was last year. A guy had been arrested in Warsaw. He claimed to have changed engine speed via the entertainment system. - Do you have his name? - Wait. Apparently... David Keller. Surely his real name. These guys love to sign their exploits. Intriguing music ... Vibrator ... -Hello ? * -I have a huge thing. * Keller worked for Pegasus for 3 months before being fired. * Impossible to find his trace. It has been missing from radar since June. -Caroline, I'll call you back. ... "Expecting to fly" (Neil Young) ... -Return to your seat, please. Tension music ... * Crackling -What is that noise ? * Beeps - I don't know. It looks like * interference. ... * -I take off my helmet, it's unbearable. -He wanted to make a splash? -He wanted to expose the flaw, not crash the plane. The MHD was not faulty, but he could not deal with conflicting orders. There was Keller and the pilots. -You have no proof. -Yes, this photo of Keller on the plane. -You see Keller. His name is not on the passenger list. -I know. It has necessarily been erased. Wait. Are you on my side? You called me. Are you going to write this article? -At the time, an anonymous source had contacted a colleague. His informant asserted that an engine failure had caused the accident. Only when the wreckage was found, the engine was intact. According to the investigation, the pilot struggled with a trim control. Yesterday, I saw my colleague. He is formal. The documents could only come from the BEA. Was that you? I am wrong ? -I heard a break in the driveshaft. - You thought you heard. It wasn't. -The plane had a problem. I couldn't wait and let other devices fly of the same type. - You are wrong. You should have told me about it. How can you trust yourself? - Don't let go. I know I am right. - Sorry, Mathieu. You are unreliable. I am more with you. -Wait. Wait ! Noemie! Noémie, please. 5 min and I'll leave you alone. Charge me. Tell them it was me, the thief. That it's my fault. I'll go talk to them, they'll reinstate you. You have to help me. I wouldn't come to see you otherwise. I'm going to be fired from the BEA, no one believes me. I know the truth about the crash. I have more than that. I have more than that. If you find your place, we will believe you. Hold on. I was wrong, it was on the CVR. Interference, the pilots who take off their helmets, it was a hacking. You listen to me ? Believe me. - Let go of me ! - You hear me ? - Let go of me, I don't want to see you anymore! -Mathieu, it's a very difficult decision to make. You know how much I appreciate your work. You also know that the collective approach is crucial for us. You did not take it into account and preferred to follow your instincts, it's not the first time, but here... You have gone too far. So I will have to ask for your transfer. -Excuse me, I will need the information on the Dauphin crash. I don't have access. Sorry, I have to get all of your files. - Have you worked on it? - I don't have access. Only Pollock and you have the hand. I'm in a hurry. - I have to get everything together, I'm sending this to you. -OKAY. Thank you.

He stood up to this investigation. -All this story, this black box, it obsessed him. He thought he heard something. -What ? It was inaudible. The pilots had removed their helmets. -How do you know ? For helmets. How do you know ? -It's written in the report. -The BEA has already published it? -No, Atrian got it early. Intriguing music ... -Excuse me. We have the Dubai-Paris manifesto. Balsan is gone. I give it tomorrow? -Who asked? -Mathieu. -Give it to me. He asks for the manifesto when we have it. -He wanted the printed version in Dubai. -He told you why? -Attention to detail.

We need to talk about it. *Why do you say nothing ? Where are you ? -Do not worry. I'll meet you in an hour, okay? I love you. ... -Thank you.

The tinnitus and the heartbeat stop. Hubbub ... -Noemia! How are you ? -How are you. - Are you coming to listen to me? - That will be fair. I am preparing the conference with Thales. -Sure. I'm glad you're here. -I couldn't go around in circles anymore. -If you need, I'm here. The idea that our generation is taking on slowly, with difficulty, it is that of the pilot's disappearance. The challenge will be to protect and secure devices where AI will take an increasingly important place. I can already hear some people judge our disproportionate ambitions, seeing us as the Icares of aeronautics. Icarus, flying too close to the sun, his wax wings melted and he died thrown into the sea. I never knew if the moral of this story should be "do not fly too high", as is commonly thought, or rather "forget the wax and the feathers and bump the design of the wings".
