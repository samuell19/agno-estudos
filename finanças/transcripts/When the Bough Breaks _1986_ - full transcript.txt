- The accused has no previous criminal record and there's no evidence he's a danger to the community or will flee this court's jurisdiction. On the other hand, the crime with which he stands charged is indeed a serious one. Bail is set at $250,000. (crowd shouting) - Mr. Hickle, how 'bout a statement. - I am innocent. - [Reporter] Mrs. Hickle! (crowd chattering) Is your husband innocent? Mrs. Hickle, this way please. Mrs. Hickle! - You're next. - [Reporter] Mrs. Hickle, Mrs. Hickle. - Doctor Delaware, what effect do you think the release of Hickle will have on the children? - No comment. - Is it true, you'll testify in court-- - You heard the man, no comment. - But Doctor Weller, just something. - They let him go. - It's just on bail, Mr. Hammers. - How could they do this after what he's done? - Alleged to have done. - This is Detective Stewart. - You think he didn't do it? Is that what you're saying? Is that what the cops think? - Nobody's saying that Mr. Hammers. - My God, MaryAnn can't sleep. - She's terrified and now with him out. - Please, this is not the time to talk. Can you come to my office Friday? We'll talk there please. - Accused child molester, Stuart Hickle was released today on $250,000 bail. - I don't believe this. Where's he get that kind of money? - Turns out he's rich. Don't worry about it. - Don't worry about it? You don't have to work with the kids day after day. I mean, entire families are coming apart. - [Reporter] What are you gonna do with the kids? - No comment! - [Reporter] What are you gonna do-- - I am innocent! - I mean, they should have at least referred the guy for treatment for God's sake. - That usually comes after conviction if he's convicted. - What do you mean if? - You haven't even gone to trial. - Their parents told them. Tell you one thing, I know some people are going to be very sorry that they persecuted me. - Oh, change the channel, will ya? Turn it off, will ya please? - Alex, you wanna lighten up? Robert, would you mind? You know what I wonder about, I wonder about the wife. We can never pin anything on her even though she's, where you going? - Out into the night to contemplate what I do and why I do it. - Ah, the joys of confronting human misery. - Kinda like surfing in a cess pool. - Alex, do yourself a favor. Take a break, go home. - I've got work to do at the office. (ominous music) (intense music) (slow calm music) No, no. Sorry about that. - I thought you didn't have nightmares anymore. - I don't. - [Woman] Alex. - What do you want for breakfast? - [Woman] Are there any clean towels? - Doubt it. - [Woman] What's happening to this house? No clean towels, no soap in the shower? - I've told you before, I don't take peanut butter on mine. - I'm so glad you could make it for breakfast. - That is disgusting. Do you have anything that's edible around here? - [Woman] Alex, I'm getting you a cleaning lady and I will not take no for an answer. - What can I do for ya Milo? - Anyone special? - An acquaintance. - Where's your hair dryer? - Broken. - Oh Alex. - Alex. - Hi. - Hi. If we wait for him to introduce us, we'll part strangers. Milo. - Hi, Lisa. - Nice to meet you. - You too. - You need to keep her. - Was that a proposal? - Are you kidding? It's tough enough just being your friend. - Amen. 'Scuse me. - Certainly. You've been hiding something from me Alex. - What do you want? - Couldn't this just be a social call? - Nope, you got that bloodhound look. - With such intuitive powers, you should've been a shrink. Actually, I could use your help. - That's great. That's just what I need. - I'm late for the hospital. Oh my God. - Police business, sorry. - Listen, why don't you call me when you rejoin the human race, okay? Bye. - Bye. - Bye bye, nice meeting you. - You too! - This used to be a colleague of yours. A shrink named Kennedy and this was his girlfriend, Elaine Vargas, who it also turns out was one of his patients. Whoever did this really sliced them up like sushi. - That's lovely, ya know, you're doing wonders for my appetite. - See, I think it's your choice of breakfast food. Anyway, I got no witnesses at all Alex except a seven year old girl who can't remember anything except she saw shadows. So naturally, I thought of you. - What happened to the police's vaunted behavioral science division? - Well, they don't know kids, you do. - Did, Milo. Past tense. Thank you. Anyway, I've had enough blood and gore to last me a lifetime, thank you very much. - What are you talking about, Hickle? That poor perv was just trying to atone for his sins blowing himself away in your office. - Thank you Doctor Sturgis. You're the cop, I'm the shrink, remember? - Oh yeah, then why don't you go back to work? - Listen, it takes a while. I know what I'm doing. I've got a PhD. - Oh yeah, I forgot. Except after six months of retirement, six months of licking your wounds, you're not getting any better. You are getting into hot tubs, jogging, collecting junk art. Pretty soon, you'll be buying yourself a guru, but I got news for ya, Doc. Nirvana through inertia doesn't make it. - That's downright inspirational Milo. - You don't wanna talk, fine. All I need from you is an hour or two talking to the kid. She knows something she can't remember, Alex. I can feel it. I just need some help getting to it. I don't know, hypnosis maybe. Afterward, we repair to the restaurant of your choice and then you can drift back up here and I go home to Rick. - How is Rick? - Disgruntled 'cause I'm never there. - Don't complain, you're lucky. - It's true, he is every mother's dream. Nice Jewish doctor. Well, what do ya say? We get any kinda description at all, great. If not, hey, huh? Huh? - No. - [Milo] Great. - Slaughter house, I assume. - Right. Mother's the manager. Kid's an insomniac. Apparently, she was sitting up in that window when the murders took place. - Oh, very nice, upscale. - Wait. (knocking) - [Woman] Yeah? - Mrs. Quinn? It's Detective Sturgis. - Oh, you're back again. - Yes, this is Doctor Delaware, the psychologist I mentioned to you. - How do you do? - You talk to Doctor Towle about this hypnotizing? - Mrs. Quinn, this is a police investigation. - Look, I told ya before, she didn't see nothin'. Anyway, she lies to get attention. - Mrs. Quinn. - Look officer, I don't want no trouble. This place is all singles, they don't like kids. Besides, I need the job. - I understand Mrs. Quinn. I would still like Doctor Delaware to talk to Melody, please? Please? - Melody? - [TV] Calm down Susan. Susan Alexander, I dare you. - Hello Melody. I'm Doctor Delaware, I'm a psychologist. Do you know what that means? Well I'm the kind of doctor that doesn't give shots. What I do is I talk with kids and we draw sometimes and we play together and I help them if they're feeling sad or angry or scared. Would you like to play? - Answer the doctor, Melody. - Me too. Maybe I could come back sometime and we could play together. Would you like that? - If she's a good girl. - I'm sure she is a good girl, Mrs. Quinn. - Yeah, go on back, watch TV, huh? Go on. Wait, it's time for your pills. - 'Scuse me, may I see that please? - I took her to Doctor Towle when the teachers kept sending home notes saying she couldn't sit still. Her mind wanders. Doctor said she's hyperactive. - Thank you. - Don't just stand there, get in there and watch TV, huh? See how she is? - Nevertheless, Mrs. Quinn, I'd still like Doctor Delaware to talk with Melody some more. Excuse me, I'll be in touch. - What's the problem? - She's on medication. I can't work with her unless I get a doctor's permission. - Well talk to him, get him to take her off. - You don't talk to Doctor Towle, you listen. - You know him? - He's the chief of pediatrics at the hospital. - Where you used to work? - Yes. - Great! - No, not great. - Why? - He believes in the pharmacological solution to all of life's problems. - Look, can't you at least talk to him? - Hey Milo, don't. - Did you see the eyes on that kid? Do me a favor, will ya? When you go and talk to Towle, shave, please. Really. - Doctor will be with you shortly. - Thank you very much. - Doctor Delaware. - Yes, Doctor Towle. She's very beautiful. - My wife, she died very young. - I'm sorry. - Yes, so was I. Please. - Thank you. - Hope you won't think me abrupt if I ask you what you're interest is in Melody Quinn. - No, not at all. I've been asked by the police to interview her as a possible witness to a crime. - You and I have never had the good fortune to work together. Indeed, I understood you'd retired from our staff. - This is a favor for a friend, Detective Sturgis. - Ah, he investigated the Hickle case, didn't he? You two were all over the 6:00 news. - Yes, yes we were. - That was a tragedy, particularly for the children. - I admired your work, Alex. May I call you Alex? - Yes please, yes. - Your departure from the field of behavioral pediatrics was a loss, a great loss. - Thank you very much. - I must confess, I'm a bit surprised to find a psychologist of your reputation making such an unusual request. - Why is that? - Melody Quinn is a severely hyperactive child. Without her medication, her attention span's too short for school. She can't sit still. She'll develop significant behavioral problems. - Is there a way that you could reduce the dosage temporarily? - I don't like to tamper with a winning combination. - I see, alright alright. Boy, she must have posed quite a problem to merit 60 milligrams. - Why else would I prescribe it? - No, no, no, I just, well I got the impression when I was talking to the mother that maybe she didn't wanna disturb the neighbors and perhaps she was using the medication in a haphazard way, that's all. - Well, I'd have to check that but there is a social context here. If there's nowhere for the girl and her mother to live, that's hardly therapeutic, now is it? Now it's a matter of cost, risk, analysis. - I'd still really appreciate it if you'd consider just lowering the dosage for a few days. - Why is this important to you? - I would like your consent to hypnotize Melody. - Hypnotize. You said interview. - Yes I did, but the police think that she may remember more under hypnosis. - Taking this child off medication won't make her more susceptible to hypnosis. Her concentration would be poorer. - I have inductions that are specially suited for children with short attention spans. - Well, anything's possible. Of course, the question is, is it advisable? No, no, no, as Melody's physician, I must insist that she continue with the regime that I have prescribed for her so that she can function normally. - Will you consent to hypnosis, Warren? - I'll tell you what. Because of my respect for you, I'll think about it. - He'll think about it. - Alex? - God, what an egomaniac. Doctor is omnipotent. Doctor can fix anything. - I take it he wouldn't give his permission. - Doctor will think about it. - You're worried about the kid, aren't you? - Yeah, you're damn right I am. - So what now? - I have to go back and tell Melody we won't be playing together after all so she doesn't think I just disappeared. - You think one of Kennedy's patients could've killed him? - Why you asking me? Come on. - Come on Alex. Just check out Kennedy's files. See if anyone strikes your trained eye. You can do it in your hammock. - Mrs. Quinn. Hi. Oh, I didn't expect you back so soon. I've just come by to tell Melody that we won't be-- - Melody. - You're gonna have to buy her lunch and give her her pill. - No actually Mrs. Quinn, you don't understand. - You guys wanna hypnotize her, the least you could do is feed her. - Shall we? We'll be back in a couple of hours. (playful carnival music) Wanna go for a ride? You don't? How come? - Mommy said don't be greedy. - Well I wanna go for a ride, so come on. - Thanks for the bear. - You're welcome. - Doctor Delaware? - Why don't you call me Alex, Melody? - I'm supposed to take my pill now. - Oh, right. How do these make you feel? - Kind of, I don't know, funny I guess. - I'll tell you what, why don't we take these a little later on, okay? (laughter) - Uh oh, got my bear wet. Doctor Delaware, Alex, you gonna hypnotize me? - Only if you want me to. - Will it make me think better? - You think just fine Melody, but it may help you remember. Melody, I want you to remember the night the doctor was hurt, it's alright, it's okay. You're safe and you're very relaxed. But now you can see yourself, just like being in a movie. And you see yourself at night, you get up from bed, you walk towards the window and you look out. Now tell me what you see. - Dark. - Yes, it's dark outside, what else do you see? - Shadows. - How many? - Two, no three. - That's good, can you tell me what they look like? - Except one of them walks funny. - Funny, how funny? - I don't know, just funny. - Okay, that's very good. Can you see anything else? (eerie music) Melody, what is it? - Something else. - Tell me. - After the shadows, somebody screamed. - Don't you ever knock? - Do you know what happens to guys who leave their doors unlocked? - Friends invade their privacy. - You have no privacy, you're a police consultant now. - No, no thank you. - It's official Alex, I signed your name myself. What happened with Melody? - One of these shadows walked funny and somebody screamed. - You hypnotized her? - Yeah and I left her my phone number too in case she thinks of anything else, but I think that's probably it. - What about the files, you find any likely candidates? - Nine might qualify, not that Kennedy was much of a therapist. No treatment plans, stress histories, almost no clinical notes at all, just sarcastic comments on his patients. These I categorized as possible psychopaths. - No, not him, not her. - You know something I don't know? - Yeah, while you've been psychologizing, I've been detecting, checking the whereabouts of all of Kennedy's patients. They're all accounted for or have alibis except these three. Ready, let's go. - Where are we going? - You think I'm still into rehab? Wrong. - Uh huh. - No, you see, my car just died right in front of your house and I could use a ride to check out these names. - Sure you could. - Alex, you don't believe me, I'm really hurt. - Don't cry, it's not manly. - Thank you Alex. Oh Alex, your card. Okay, we got a college student, a pharmacist down in Sagas, and a salesman in the valley, suspects hall. - [Alex] The valley, oh that's great. I love Burbank in the springtime. - It's fall and don't be provincial. - May I assist you? - Maurice Bruno please. Mr. Bruno's not available. - Who's his boss? - That would be Mr. Gershman. - Then that would be who I'd like to talk to. - May I inquire about what? - No honey, you may not. - Come on in. - Behave yourself. - Look, I'll be with you guys in a sec, okay? Lenny? Lenny, I got cops here, I gotta go. Yeah, cops. I don't know Lenny, I don't know. Look, you wanna ask em? Right, right, that's what I figured. Okay look, we got a deal here or what? Yeah, yeah, matchbooks, coasters, the whole schmeer. Okay fine, that's good. I promise delivery in three weeks. Yeah okay right, you bet your bippy. Okay sweetie, bye bye, gotta go. 'Scuse the glitz. My wife and her interior decorator. See what happens when the gay boys dictate things? So, tell me, what do you want with Maury? - Just a few questions. - Ah, come on, you guys can't harass him like this. I mean, he did his time for the bad check rap. The court even made him go to a shrink. He's clean. - Where is he, Mr. Gershman? - Vegas. We do a lot of business there. - How long has he been there? - Week, two weeks, I don't know. I don't check on him. - Can you get him on the phone? - Why not? Grace, yeah, get Maury at the Sands for me, will you? Yeah. You know, you're making a big mistake here. - What's that? - Whatever it is you think Maury did. I mean, he may played a little fast and loose in the past, but that's all behind him now. Besides, he's a terrific salesman. (phone ringing) Yeah, Maury? What do you mean he's not there? - You got an address? - Look, he just switched hotels, that's all. - Where does he live? - Glendale, look, this is a guy who works a 74 hour week and on top of that, he volunteers to work with kids. - Where does he do that? - Reverend McCaffrey's place. That's Pueblos de los Ninos, it's a home for homeless kids out by Malibu. I'm tellin' ya, you're making a big mistake here. - The address, Mr. Gershman. Please. - Looks like nobody's home. (ominous music) What's the matter? - Gotta find a phone. We need the Glendale PD. (emergency siren) (coughing) Get outta here, get outta here. Get outta here! You know why this shakes you up so much? Expectations. See, you think all that's wrong with the world is people got problems and you can solve em. - You're getting simplistic. - What you don't understand is that some people don't have problems, some people are the problem. I worry about you Alex. - I'm fine Milo. - That's what you said last time. Right after Hickle just before you bailed out. - I didn't bail out, I took a sabbatical. - If there's one thing I learned in the military, it was about acute stress reactions. - Oh, what did they do? Did they send the guys right back into battle? Get off my back, will ya? - I guess what I'm trying to say is, I'm sorry you had to see what you did today. - Me too. - But don't get regressive on me, okay? Things happen, we gotta go on living in the world, ya know? You ever treat a cop? - Father of a patient, real angry guy. He used to like to say that the scum out there are like weeds, a real bitch to get rid of and once you do, another one pops right back up in the same place. - That's what I've been making my living at for the last 12 years, spreading weed killer. I don't know what the problem is, I could've driven your car back. - Wait, wait for me, wait for me, I'll be right back. Come on, come on, come on. - Quiet, you have to be quiet. You're gonna wake him up. - Let me do it. - I got it. - You can't even see what you're doing. - Key is bent, this is the bent key. It's the wrong lock. - Well give me the right here. Hang on. - I know this guy. - Evening gentlemen. - Doctor Delaware, you know Doctor Silverman. Doctor Silverware (laughter). - Don't you just hate a drunk who laughs at his own jokes? Thank you. - Good to see you. - Yeah, thanks for getting him home. - Yeah, you're welcome. - He has no sense of humor, but he's great. - I love you too. - Where are you going? - I'm going home. - You're welcome to stay, you know that. - I know, thanks. - No, he can't stay, he cannot stay because we have no hot tub, right? - Yeah right. - But we got a cold shower, come on. - Here, take care of him, will ya? Let go of me man. Goodnight Milo. Ah, how thoughtful of you to bring my car back. - Protect and serve is our motto. I don't suppose you have any tomato juice around or anything, do you? - Don't tell me this is a social call. - No, as a matter of fact, it's not. Came to compare notes. - Well, I don't have any. - Yeah well, a pharmacist and a college student both have alibis, so Bruno's it as far as suspects go. - He's dead, so case closed. - Almost. Now remember Melody said something about one of the shadows walked funny? Well it turns out one of the footprints forensics found outside of Bruno's house might have been from a guy with a bad leg. Also, when we checked their phone records, we found that Kennedy and Bruno had been talking a lot together after Bruno's treatments were finished. - So? - So, is that usual? I mean, do your patients usually call you up after their treatments are over? - Sometimes. - Every day? - No. - Think these calls could have been therapeutic? - Doubtful. - Yeah, that's what I figured. So, what did Kennedy the shrink and Bruno the psycho have to talk about? - Don't tell me please. - Don't worry, I can't, it's all just coincidental connections. Like for example, the best guesstimate the coroner can make is that Bruno was killed between 10 and 12 days ago. - Isn't that about the same time that Kennedy and the Vargas woman were killed? - Another little tasty tidbit is that the good Doctor Kennedy had a record. Insurance fraud, seems like he'd been billing MediCal for patients in a nursing home he never bothered to visit. - Well there it is. - What? - The connection you've been looking for. - You gonna tell me? - Yeah, ya big oaf. I'll take ya out to lunch. See you've been assuming that Kennedy was treating Bruno. What if he was using him instead? - What do you mean, like a psychopathic shrink? - Yeah, yeah, it wouldn't be the first time. Maybe they were involved in some scam together. Maybe you should check out their insurance claims, their financial records, stuff like that. - Maybe. - What about the Vargas woman? - What about her? - Well, we know that she was having an affair with Kennedy. Which wasn't exactly ethical on his part and we also know that she's dead, maybe she wasn't the innocent bystander. - Oh you mean like, maybe she was part of whatever scam Kennedy and Bruno were running. - Yeah I mean, what do you know about it? - Family lives in East LA. If Kennedy had a file on her, it's gone now. - What'd she do for a living? - Teacher, special ed. - Where? - West LA. Interviewed another teacher at their, Raquel Santos, chicano, supposed to be Vargas' best friend. The way she talked, you'd think they never even knew each other. I figure she's lying, probably hates cops. You know Alex, you ought to be real good at talking to teachers. - Oh, you're good. You're very good. Where's she teach? - Willow Lane Elementary. - Miss Santos. - Yes? - I'm Alex Delaware, I'm working with Detective Sturgis. - PhD in what? - Psychology. - Cops don't get satisfaction, so they send in the shrinks, huh? - I have a few questions I'd like to ask you about Elaine Vargas. - Elena, I'm sorry, I'm busy. - I don't understand, you're too busy to find out who murdered your friend? - What gives you the right to say that to me? It's the cops who don't care. - No, that's not true. - Oh and you're the example of LA's finest? - Listen, I'm sorry you feel this way, but I do need some information, that's all. - Well, not from me. (school bell ringing) - Alright, fine. Will you tell me where Elena's family lives? - You're gonna go into my old neighborhood? - If I have to, yes. - Could you please leave? I've got a class to teach. - Oh well good, then we both have something to do, don't we? - (sigh) They're in the book. Under V. - For Vargas. - Good thinkin'. - 'Scuse me. - Thank you, thank you. - 'Scuse me, I'm looking for the Vargas family. Cruz Vargas? Hi, I'm Doctor Delaware, I'm a psychologist and I'm working with the police on the murder of Mrs. Vargas' daughter. - Yeah, sure you are. - Can you tell me where I can find Mrs. Vargas? - What's he want man? - Nothing. - I'm looking for the Vargas family. - For what? - Stay out of this. Listen Doc, why don't you take your phony concern and stuff it back in that fancy car of yours before somebody gets hurt? - Yeah. - Listen, all I wanna do-- - What? What, psychoanalyze us? You wanna open us up and see what makes us tick? You wanna watch an old woman cry? Is that how you get your kicks? You sick sucker, get outta here! - Nail him! - Quiet! Get outta here. (kids shouting) - Watch your step, come on. - Hi. Can I give you a hand? - Yes, bye bye. Did you visit the Vargas family? - Fool that I am, yes. - You could just dump that there. - Well I guess I owe you an apology. - Does this mean you'll talk to me? - I don't know. - Listen, we know that Kennedy was a creep. And we're pretty sure that Elena was an innocent victim, but please help us make sure. - Okay. - Thank you. I saw you with the kids, you're good with them. - I hate the bureaucracy, but I love what I do. - Elena? - Yes, Elena. I just miss her. - I understand. - Do you? I'm sorry, it's just she was so special and the kids loved her and they learned so much from her. Now she's gone. Look, I don't think I can do this anymore. One of her kids was killed. His name is Carey Namith. He was new when she got him and after she worked with him, you could hardly shut him up. He was an orphan from the pueblo. Elena felt just like his mother. It was a hit and run. God, what a waste. - Was that Pueblo de los Ninos? - Yes, they contract with us for special ed. - Is that why she started treatment with Kennedy? - Well, she was depressed. Kennedy changed her. I warned he was so slimy, but she was in love, so she bought new clothes and a 300ZX and-- - How could she afford that? - Payments. She might have let him take advantage of her, but she would never take any money. She was no whore. - No of course she wasn't, I'm sorry. If I have any other questions, can I get back to you? - Yes. - Thank you. This kid, Carey Namith, lived up at the pueblo. He was a student of Elena Vargas. And when he's killed, she gets real depressed and starts treatment with Kennedy. Pretty soon, they're going to bed together and right after that, Bruno volunteers to become a member of the gentlemens brigade up at Pueblo de los Ninos. - Alex, you wanna keep your voice down? - Why, what's the matter? - I've created a monster. - [Alex] What are you talking about? - Look Alex, you've done great work and I really appreciate it. But now that you got your motor running again, you're pushing too hard. So relax, relax. - What are you talking about? You asked me, remember? - Yeah, but now I'm asking you to back off. Look Alex, I want this investigation, but I want it done right. Now I'm not the most popular guy on the department and there's no way I'm gonna risk getting dumped off this case by blindly pointing my finger at Reverend McCaffrey who happens to be connected from here to Sacramento. - Well you can at least check it out, can't you? - And I will, discreetly. Now, can I have your ID card back? - I left it at home. - Okay but remember, you're retired. Alex? - I heard you. - Say it. - I'm retired. - Thank you. (slow orchestral music) (phone ringing) - About time Milo. Hello? - [Woman] You call yourself a doctor? You tell me you know what you're doing? - Who is this? - [Woman] You know damn well you messed with my baby's mind! - Mrs. Quinn? (screaming girl) What's wrong? - [Mrs. Quinn] Listen to her. (screaming) - [Melody] Get away! - Mrs. Quinn? Mrs. Quinn, I'll be right there. (child screaming) - Melody, shut up! Hurry, please, do something! (screaming) - Melody, it's me, Alex. - No more shadows. - You see what you done to her? - Hypnosis has nothing to do with this, Mrs. Quinn. - That's not what Doctor Towle said. - Melody sweetheart, it's okay, come on, it's okay. You're safe, it's okay, it's okay Melody. It's alright. - Alex? - [Alex] Yes, it's me Alex. - Alex, Alex, they came back. - Who did, who did? - The shadows. - No, it was just a dream Melody. - No, no, they were here. - No, it was just a bad dream sweetheart. Now I want you to open your eyes. Will you do that please? Come on, open your eyes. - Do what he says Melody. - Sweetheart, come on, open your eyes, come on. (knocking) Melody, please come on. There you go. Open em up. Sweetheart. - Take your hands off that child. - She's just having a nightmare, that's all. - Caused no doubt by your unethical meddling. I think you better leave, Doctor. - She doesn't need that. - Obviously, your memory needs polishing. You can see why I was reluctant to tamper with this child's mind. - Nobody's tampered with anything. Please don't do that. - What if I bring you up before the ethics committee of the state medical board? - You do that doctor and we'll have a little discussion about the proper use of stimulant medication with children. - You heard the doctor, get out! - Hold her. - No Mommy please, I don't like needles. - Can I help you sir? - Yes please, Doctor Delaware to see Mr. Kruger. I have a 3:00 appointment. - Yes sir. - Doctor Delaware, I presume? - Yes. - Tim Kruger. I was expecting someone a little older. I understand you're retired. - I am while I can still enjoy it. - There's something to be said for that. Shall we take the tour and then Reverend Gus will see ya at four. - Sure. - These are the dorms. They were donated by several corporations and the murals were painted by the kids. From here, you get a pretty good view of our layout. We have 27 acres, but only five are fully developed. To the south is a meadow. There'll be a vegetable garden there this summer and to the north is the grove, which is perfect for nature hikes. Here at the pueblo, we try to combine a structure and reassurance of a daily routine with a creative environment that encourages a healthy development. - Well, you certainly seem to have a handle on things. Where'd you train? - MAU of Oregon, counseling. Wanted to go for a doctorate, but no bucks. Before that, a BA in SAC from Jetson. - Jetson, that's up near Seattle, right? - You know Jetson. - Only by reputation, that all you students were rich. - Not this one I'm afraid. Went through on scholarship. - Well, these are the dorms. Shall we? (coughing) - Is that you Rodney? Withdrawing one of our current challenges. Hello Rodney, what seems to be the trouble? - Rodney's sick. - What kind of a sickness? - Tummy hurt. - Hmm, that sounds like you should see the doctor when he visits. - No, no doctor! - Alright, we'll discuss it later. But now, it is time to get up. Woah. Rodney, this is a friend, Doctor, Mr. Delaware. - Hi Rodney. - Rodney, be friendly or you'll lose privileges. Sorry about that. He's nine going on four. Reverend Gus doesn't believe in taking the easy ones. - Where do you get your kids? - Everywhere, anywhere they're not wanted, cared for. They're orphans mostly, throwaways. Reverend Gus is a compassionate man. Shall we? - Yes. - Okay, short strokes now. - Hey Earl, say hello to Doctor Delaware. - How you doin', doc? - Pretty good, yourself? - Good thanks. - Earl's one of my best counselors. And Bob Hallsy, our coach. Bob, Doctor Delaware. - Doctor, my pleasure. - Mine too. - Doctor Delaware is a perspective gentleman if Reverend Gus approves, of course. - Well that's great. We can't have too many pros working with these kids, right Earl? - Shall we, it's almost four. - I guess I'll see y'all later. - Count on it, Doc. - By the way Bob, maybe you could work out a program for Rodney, something to build his confidence? - You bet. - Doctor Alex Delaware, of course. - How do you do? - How nice to meet you. And to introduce you to our distinguished board member, Judge Edwin Marks of the Los Angeles judiciary. - Oh, well it's an honor. - Your reputation precedes you Doctor. We've all admired your work with those poor children. - Thank you. - Judge Marks is a member of our gentlemen's brigade. Ordinarily, he would be wearing a more dashing ensemble. But our monthly talent show is coming up and Bobo the clown is our most popular MC. - I'm afraid I must go to rehearsal. Pleasure Doctor Delaware. - Yes, thank you. - [Reverend] Tim, would you show the judge out please? - Yes sir. - I hope I'm not interrupting anything here. - Oh not at all. Matter of fact, when the judge heard that you were coming, he insisted on meeting you despite his getup. Please have a seat. - Thank you. - Tim tells me that you have retired. May I ask you why? - Oh, well I guess I needed a change of pace, time to sort out my values. - Reflection can be profoundly valuable. However, we need good people in your field. Like the way you handle that terrible daycare scandal. Children abused, a man's life wasted with no possibility of salvation. Do you think the man who killed himself could've been rehabilitated? - I don't know, I don't think the statistics are very encouraging. - Statistically, these children don't have a prayer. But with prayer and compassion and the generosity of people like yourself, miracles happen here everyday. - Well, those are some very busy men. You must be very persuasive, Reverend. - Not at all. I simply recognize a basic human need, whether it's a supervisor, a judge, or a senator, he has in his heart a basic need to give. You yourself satisfied your own altruistic need through your own profession and when you stopped, the hunger returned. - I have to admit, I have begun to miss working with kids. - And here you are. - Well, I'm certainly impressed by your organization and your vigor and it's an honor to be considered for membership with men like Judge Marks. - Well, then we will expect to see you at our next orientation meeting. I'll have my secretary handle all the details. - Oh, thank you for your time Reverend. - No, thank you. - [Child] No, no! Leave me alone, no! No! Leave me alone! - [Man] Shut up! - No, no! (ominous music) - You crazy man? I told ya, this guy McCaffrey was connected to people in high places. - They didn't suspect anything. - Oh sure, right, the psychologist who treated the victims in the worst child abuse case in the city's history suddenly decides to come out of retirement by volunteering at the pueblo? What do you think, they're stupid? - Will you just listen to me at least? - Alright, let's hear it. - There's something not right about that place. - I'm listening. - I admit that on the surface, everything seems normal but-- - I need evidence, evidence. - Alright, alright, alright, here listen. Tim Kruger, the head of counseling up there told me that he had a BA from Jetson College in psychology and a MA from Oregon except he never went to Oregon and his undergraduate degree was in dramatic arts. I mean, the guy was lying to me. - Excuse me, isn't that confidential information? - What's your point? - How'd you get it? You lied to some college admissions office, right? I can't use that in court. - It's the feel of the place Milo. They've got gates, fences, I mean, everybody's so upbeat, so relentlessly positive, but right underneath the surface. - Underneath the surface what? What, what? - I think they may be mistreating the kids up there. - That's quite an accusation. You got anything to back it up? - I wanna talk to you Sturgis. - Captain, I'd like you to meet Doctor Alex Delaware. - How do you do? - 'Scuse us. (phone ringing) - What was that all about? - Nothing, police business. - We're talking about evidence. - Drop it. - What do you mean drop it? - Look, you know what you got here Alex? Nothing. All your evidence is coincidental. Most of it questionably obtained. - You don't believe that. - I'll tell you what I believe, I believe I should've left you in retirement. - What about all the connections Milo? Come on man, talk to me. - What connections? What connections, so this kid Carey, what's his name? - Namith! - So this kid Carey Namith gets killed and his teacher is Elaine Vargas, right? So what? And maybe she and this guy Kennedy are involved in some scam. - What about Bruno? - And maybe they're not. - Well did you check their financial records? - Not yet. - What about Kruger lying to me? - What about it? - Oh come on, Milo! - Back off Alex! You are messing with people's reputations here. Powerful people who know how to use the system and you don't. - Alright, alright, what if I could get the evidence? - Alex, I am asking you as a friend. No, I'm telling you, lay off before you blow this case and me right outta the water! (ominous music) - Did Elena keep a diary or make any tape recordings or anything like that? - No, not that I know of. Why, do you think maybe she left some evidence the police didn't find? - It's possible. You think the family will talk to you? - I don't know. I think that talking about Kennedy will be especially touchy. They didn't like him. He was older and he was an Anglo. I think it's easier for them to just deny the whole thing. - How long have you been gone? - 1,000 years. My parents are gone and I didn't have any family left here. Raphael, how you doing? Raphael's been zoned out for years. Andy's the responsible one. - What's he doing here? - We just wanna talk to your Mom. - She's not home. - Senora? (foreign language) - Raquelita. (sobbing) (foreign language) - He'd like to ask you some questions. - No. No! - Wait here. - You were warned man. - She'll talk with you but please be patient. She's not happy about any of this. (foreign language) - I'm very sorry for your loss. Please forgive me, but did Elena have more money right before she died? I'm sorry but I need to ask this. It's very important. - No. - Thank you. Is there anything you can tell me, anything at all about your daughter's involvement with Doctor Kennedy? - If it hadn't been for that (foreign language), my daughter would still be alive. - Mrs. Vargas, would it be alright if I were to take a look at Elena's things? (foreign language) - Thank you. I'll take it outside. - I'll stay with her. (sobbing) - Hey! - What did I tell you? - What the hell do you think you're doing huh? - I'm investigating the death of your sister man. - Uh uh no, you're outta here man. Now! (shouting woman) Ma, I caught this dude stealing. - He's a guest in our house. - He's nothing! You think he cares? Well maybe if it was some white chick, huh? Some Elaine from Beverly Hills? Well there'd be cops all over this place, right? But a Mexicana whose name was Elena? Look who they send! - Apologize. (foreign language) - You're dead man. You and your coconut girlfriend. You come back here again, you're dead! Come on. - I apologize. I apologize for the rudeness of my sons. - No, it is for me to apologize. - Maybe we should go. - Damn. - Do you think there was a tape? - I don't know. - Look, I know how you feel. (slow piano) I'll see you soon. - Yes. - What can I do for you? - I'm Doctor Delaware, I'd like to see the file on a previous patient of mine please. - Name? - Carey Namith. Hey there. - Alex, what a surprise. And look at you. Does that suit and tie mean you're back among the living? - Semi, listen I got your messages and I'm sorry I didn't find you. - Oh, that's alright. I had tickets to the ballet and I thought maybe you'd like to escort me, but I took my ex instead. - My loss, his gain. - We might be getting back together. And I wanted to thank you for letting me cry on your shoulder, all those late evenings. - Well you're welcome. Listen, you have time to have a cup of coffee? - No, my break's not til 10. - Come on, just a cocoa. - But sure. Just let me freshen up, alright? Put it back Alex. - It's important. - Yeah and so is my job. Give it to me. Alex! - I'll read it here, I will. - What are you doing? - Do you remember those photographs you saw in my kitchen? - And what does Doctor Towle have to do with that? - I don't know, maybe nothing, but there are things going on that I gotta find out about. - You outta your mind? If someone were to walk in here right now, you would be barred from this hospital for life! Alex, you could lose your license. - Just give me five minutes, just five minutes. - God you've changed. You know you're back to that same obsessive behavior. At least before, you were helping people. Now, I don't-- - Lisa, I don't want you to lose your job, but I'm gonna read this. Let me at least take you out to dinner. - Oh please don't insult me Alex. - [Alex] Do what you have to do Lisa. - Alex. Five minutes in there. - [Milo] Don't you ever give up? - Listen to me, Carey Namith was killed right next to the Pueblo, but instead of taking him to a nearby hospital, they drove all the way across town to Western Pediatric where guess who was the attending physician, Warren Towle. Not only that, on Towle's personnel file, it said that he went to Jetson College just like Tim Kruger. Don't ya see what's happening? - Interesting. - What do you mean, interesting? Aren't you gonna check it up? - Maybe. - Well when? - When I get around to it. - Milo. - Stay outta this Rick. - For God's sake Milo, when are you gonna tell him you're off the case? - Leave it alone. - What happened? - Routine reassignment. - This never would've happened if you weren't gay. - That had nothing to do with it. We've been all through that. - He's your friend. - Who I would like to keep in one piece and is perfectly capable of messing things up. - Messing what up? Somebody please talk to me. - When the press found out that Milo was investigating a man of the cloth, bang, he's off the case. - How do they know that? - Well, a certain pediatrician called to complain that a certain psychologist was terrifying one of his patients, hypnotizing her. Now all of this without his consent and at the behest of a certain detective. Oh yes, and Towle also mentioned in passing, your little fishing trip out to the Pueblo. - How did Towle know that unless they told him? - Don't get excited, it's not a conspiracy. He's the medical consultant out there. - Are you ki-- What's happening here? - Nothing. - Nothing? Is that why the captain's sending you on a two week vacation? - They suspended you? - Oh no, not yet. At least not officially, but they're going to when they find out he's going down to Mexico. - Alright. Elaine Vargas did pay cash for a car and both Kennedy and Bruno's bank accounts took a big jump a few months ago. Also, the word is that the reverend used to run another pueblo down near Acapulco. I'm on the eight AM flight. - While you're in Mexico, I am going to Jetson College. - No! - Yes I am. - No, you will not go to Jetson College! While I'm gone, you will stay away from Towle and you will stay away from the Pueblo, you got that? Alex? - Yes. - Say it. - I'm retired. - Thank you. My newspaper's doing an article on intellectually prominent small colleges on the west coast and you seem to be the local historian. So naturally, I-- - Naturally, you seem to be enterprising for a reporter, Mr. Roberts. Since most of em can't write, I assume they can't read either. - Professor Van der Graaf. - You consider that intellectually prominent, do you? - If it'll set your mind at ease, Professor, you can talk to my editor in Los Angeles. They'll be happy to confirm my intent on this article. Her name is Raquel Santos, number's on the back there. - So it is. Tell me, if I should call Los Angeles information and ask for the number of the Times, would this be the correct one? - You win Professor, I'm sorry. - Don't try to bluff a bluffer, young man. Now I propose we do a little quid pro quo. - Such as? - You tell me who you are and why you're here and I'll tell you what pleases me. - That's fair enough. - You can't believe what she'd do for grades. - Professor, I'm working with the police. - I'm not interested in your phony credentials. Doctor of what? - Psychology. - An old gossip like me is only interested in scandal. Appeal to my baser instincts, Doctor. - Professor, two of your former students, Warren Towle and Tim Kruger are suspects in a criminal investigation. - What sort of investigation? - Murder. - Aha! - I'm here to find out anything I can about them. - For instance? - Well alright, for example, why Tim Kruger, a scholarship student, would lie about his undergraduate degree. - Kruger, a scholarship student? We're approaching the Kruger building, Doctor. I'm rich but the Krugers are obscene. As for lying, well, that's probably genetic. As your other suspect, his cousin twice removed. - I'm sorry, are they related? - All the 200 are related one way or another. - What are the 200? - I thought you read my book. - I skimmed it. - Well, that's typical. Go get that old Seattle map over there. I'm gonna show you Brindamoor Island. Three square miles of innately unappealing terrain upon which are 200 mansions and estates rivaling any in this country. Area in heaven! Towle and Kruger grew up a generation apart on this breeding ground by the indolence, ignorant rich. I grew up there myself, no thanks to my deformity. I was set apart, lest instead of being just lazy, I turned out to be dull like Warren Towle or vicious like Kruger. - Why do you say vicious? - Well, he killed a boy wrestling, was said to be an accident but they were dating the same girl. Snapped his neck like a twig. - Is there anything else you can tell me about Doctor Towle? - Doctor Towle? Yes, that tells you something about our medical schools. I don't believe he'd even graduated from here if it hadn't been for his family's money. He didn't complete a course his whole senior year. - Why was that? - Well, even fools can suffer. His wife, a vacuous lovely girl, drove off the Evergreen bridge one night and drowned. It was a genuine tragedy. - Where was Towle at the time? - Studying if you can believe it. Yes, the funeral was the high point of the social season. I think I've got a picture of it here somewhere. The way Towle carried on, you'd think he was responsible for it. Ha, there it is. Hamlet like, he all but lept into the grave. - Well, maybe he loved her. - Maybe he did. - Professor, wait a minute. Who is that? - Edwin Marks. - Judge Marks? - I didn't know that he was a judge. - This is Stuart Hickle. - Yes, that's right. - Oh my God, this man right here. Was he a student there? - Oh no, that's the Gus's McCaffrey. He was a janitor in Towle's married student housing. - They were all friends. - Not McCaffrey. But the rest of them were. Called themselves heads of states, the arrogant little snots. - Professor, I need to find out more about the life on Brindamoor Island. How can I do that? - Well, you could go there. (intense music) (ominous music) - Mrs. Hickle. Remember me, Alex Delaware? Your husband picked my office for his last big scene, remember? - How did you get here? What do you want? - I want the truth, Mrs. Hickle. - Stuart is dead, there's nothing to talk about. - Oh no, I think there's a lot to talk about. - Get out! - No. (dog growling) - Don't move or he'll tear you apart. (barking) - Mrs. Hickle. (growling) (shouting) - Otto! You see, I could have let him kill you. Now get out. - I can but I'm not one of them for God's sake. Please talk to me. I need your help. - Alright. Alright. Come Otto. Come in. Stay Otto. Sit down. This is how I live. I'm hiding for my life. I'm terrified they'll find me. - Towle, McCaffrey, Marks, who? - All of them and others. They were sick like Stuart. But he wanted to change, to expose them. So they killed him. - They what? - What happened in your office wasn't a suicide. And Stuart wasn't the only one who molested the children. - Why didn't you try to stop them? - I didn't know. Not until later. And Stuart, I didn't want to know. I owed him my life. I was a child whore and a gutter in soul. Starving, diseased. He fed me. Got me doctors. Married me. Brought me to America. What did I care if he liked to dress me up in little girl's clothes or when I got healthy and started to look like a woman, he didn't want me anymore. He was rich, kind. He sent me to college. He gave me the money to open my preschool. I thought he had changed. Volunteering for the gentlemen's brigade, giving money, helping the children with the pueblo. He was a very gentle man. I didn't know that his friends were monsters. - How did you find out? - Before they let him out of jail, he told me he wasn't the only one. That things weren't what they seemed with the gentlemen. - Was your school connected to the pueblo? - No, that was something else. That was the others, his friends. They came to pick him up in their big, shiny cars. Rich, powerful men. - Why didn't you tell someone? - Who? If I had told you that these other men were bad too, you wouldn't have believed me because that's the way people in this country think. Nobody's bad, they're just sick. And the police, the newspapers? If I had gone to them and told them that Reverend and McCaffrey and Judge Marks and Doctor Towle weren't just sick, they're evil, would they have believed me? Would you? - No. - You are so innocent. So blind. Because you're afraid to see that evil exists. It kills. - Thank you for doing this. Did you get in touch with Milo? - Hello. - Hi. - Hi! - I'm sorry. - That's okay. I did, I spoke to his friend and, he doesn't know where he is. He checked out of the hotel in Acapulco. - Give me just a second. I wanna make a phone call. I'll be right back. - [Phone] Hi, this is Alex Delaware, please leave your name and number at the sound of the beep. - [Milo] Alex, I hope you can hear me. Look, this is Milo. This call has been murder to place. I don't know how long it's gonna last, so I'll make it short. We got him, we got McCaffrey. I'm checkin' it out now, but I'm on the way back. Please don't do anything until then. - [Melody] Alex, Alex, I need to talk to you! Mommy says we have to move in-- - [Mrs. Quinn] What are you doing Melody? (intense music) - Come on, let's go. Who are you? - I own the building, who the hell are you? - Where's Melody? - Who? - The little girl. - Oh, with her crazy mother. Gone, split. No notice, no nothin'. She was supposed to manage the place for me. Left me with all the bills. Place looks like a pigsty. Toys, books, dirt everywhere. - What are you saying? - Elena must have been involved. She paid cash for the car. - I don't believe that. - She teaches Carey Namith how to speak and the first thing out of the poor kid's mouth is what's happening up at the pueblo. She must have told Kennedy and then, together with Bruno, they tried to blackmail McCaffrey. - No, I still don't believe that. - Alright, maybe she was a victim like everybody else, but it makes sense, that explains the money and it explains why they were all killed. They killed Carey Namith, I'm sure of it. - Oh my God. - They don't want any witnesses. We've gotta find Melody now. - But if all she saw is shadows. - They can't be sure of that. - Alex, leave it to the police. There's nothing that you can do but you don't even know where she is. Where are we going? - You're going home. - Forget it. - I don't want ya hurt. - Alex! (tires screeching) (horn blowing) - [Alex] Damn, damn! - He's still there. - Hold on, hold on, hold on. (tires screeching) Get down. - You can't drive and watch him at the same time. - Get down! (gunshots) - Oh my God. - Just hang on, hang on. We'll be alright. Alright, hold on, hold on. - Alex! - Hold on! He's from the pueblo. - Alex, what are you doing? - Stay outta this, go home. - No, I'm going with you. - Listen, I appreciate your discretion but I've already tried the number on Mr. Kruger's tax form. Excuse me, can you tell me your name please? So I can inform Mr. Kruger exactly why I wasn't able to mail this to him and why he's gonna be charged automatically the interest penalty? Thank you very much. Wilshire Boulevard? Thank you. - Alex, what are you doing? You can't follow through on this. - Try to find Milo. Tell him I couldn't wait. Please just do it. (doorbell ringing) - What the hell do you think you're doing? - Where's Melody? - Who? - Melody Quinn. - I don't know what you're talking about. - What'd you do, you kill her too? - Who the hell do you think you are, Doctor? (loud groaning) - Now Mr. Kruger, I'm gonna ask you some questions and you are gonna answer them and for every answer I don't like, you're gonna lose a joint. You know, elbow, knee, places like that. - What do you want? - I told you, I want Melody. - She's out to pueblo. - Where? - The storage sheds. - Is she still alive? - I don't know. I swear I don't know! - What about her mother? - She's dead. - Did you do that? - Bob Hallsly and Earl, they thought maybe the kid told her something. - Is that why you killed Kennedy and Elena? - I was a lookout. Bob and Earl killed them 'cause they knew too much about the gentlemen's brigade. - Let's talk about the gentlemen here for a minute. Are they all involved? - Only the ones who could pay. They make a donation, tax deductible, the reverend gives them a kid. The rest is straight, it's a blind. - Alright, now I know about the blackmail. You tell me where the tape is. - What tape? - The tape that Elena made with Carey Namith talking about the pueblo. - We burned it. (gunshot) - Oh boy, you know that's gonna hurt. - No! Over there, a copy there under the bed. - Where'd you get it, Elena? - Her brother, the hype, he sold her out for a fix man. - Who's with Melody? - Towle has her on sedatives. Unless Earl killed her. - Well you better pray that he hasn't 'cause I'm coming back Tim. I want you to talk to Towle. I want you to tell him there's been an emergency. To meet Reverend Gus up at the pueblo. 7:30 sharp. Tim, be convincing. (ominous music) Hello Doctor. - You're making a big mistake. - I'm gonna give you a chance to redeem yourself. You're gonna save a life for once instead of destroying it. - I'm a physician. I've saved many lives in my day. - Like Carey Namith's? - You know everything? - Oh yes, yes, cousin Tim has been very talkative. Why, you are a doctor for God's sake, why? - Yes, I am a doctor and you have no right to talk to me like this. - Oh, that's perfect. - Oh no, I need those! I had to. I had to, I'm a murderer. - Get up. - My wife. I loved her so much and I killed her. I didn't mean to. We were young, we were fighting and she slapped me and I struck back and she fell and she hit her head and I was trying to help her when Gus-- - Gus what? - He was working in the building here and I was paralyzed and he, he felt for her pulse and then she was dead. He called Stuart and Edmond and they came and they gave me something to make me sleep and Gus took her body. (sobbing) - Yes I know, he dumped her off the Evergreen bridge. Come on Doctor. Come on please. - I paid him money, he disappeared. Then Stuart and Edmond, I thought they were my friends. After that, they made no secret of their perversions. Through the years, they'd call on me to patch up the children that they damaged. Then Gus came back, a man of the cloth or with a mail order divinity degree crawling in old IOU's. It was the same thing all over again. I've been paying in blood ever since. - Well, it's time to stop, Doctor. Please get me through the gates. I need your help. Drive, come on, you can do it. (eerie music) Call him. - Earl. - Doc? Geez, you scared me, what are you doing here? (shouting) - Whatever you gave her, give him twice as much. Hurry up. Help me with the child, will you? - What do you want? Oh please do give me an excuse doctor. That's good. Now Warren, get his gun and give it to me. That's good. Well, what mischief have you been up to tonight, Warren? Not feeling loquacious? That's alright. We'll talk later. Right now, there's business to attend to. - Gus, I don't think-- - That's right, you don't. 'Cause if you did think, you'd know that this man can cause us a lot of trouble. I thought you had been taken care of. Now, I'll have the pleasure of that myself. - Like you did with his wife? - Shut up. - Oh wait a minute. I don't understand what you mean. - She wasn't dead, was she? Was she? - Gus? - Oh come on, you're a physician. What are the odds that a blow like that could kill? I mean, he was the one who examined her. (ominous music) - Warren, take care of the girl. - I can't. - You can and you will. Or you'll go to jail for the rest of your life for murder. - Gus, did you? - She was dead! Idiot. - No she wasn't. - Oh Doctor, not only am I going to kill you, but the police are gonna find some wonderfully obscene photographs of you with this child. Warren. - No, I won't do that. I'm a physician. - Not anymore. (gunshot) (shouting) (intense music) - Don't do it. Alex, put it down. - No, no! - Alex, it's over man. We got him for murder. We got evidence from Mexico. We got Kruger talkin' his head off. - You don't understand man! - I understand! I do, you hate him. You wanna see him dead. But then you become part of the problem. - I don't care! - Yes you do, you care. - Alex? - Oh God no. - You care about her. You care about all the other kids up here. - God no. (sobbing) - Alex, my friend, please. (somber music) (sobbing) - I'm afraid Alex. (emergency sirens) (police dispatch in background) (soft music) (gentle music)
