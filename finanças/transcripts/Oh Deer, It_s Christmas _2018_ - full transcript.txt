Ho ho ho ho ho. Ho ho ho ho ho. ♪ It's Christmas time ♪ ♪ Do do do do do do ♪ ♪ It's Christmas time ♪ ♪ Do do do do ♪ ♪ Happy Christmas, it's Christmas time ♪ I can't wait for Christmas, you guys. Look at all the presents that are already under our tree. - Ours has still got to be the very first tree of the holiday season. - Right. I mean, who in the whole wide world could possibly get a jump on Christmas like we do? - Santa's own faithful reindeer squad. Tinker, Terry, Perry, and Larry. - Putting smiles on faces and brightening even the snowiest nights for, how long have we been doing this gig for now? - A long time. - That's right, a real long time. And every Christmas morning, it still feels like my first ride in the sleigh. - That's the magic of Christmas, Terry. - Huh. Hocus pocus is more like it. - Hey, what's up with you, Larry? - Yeah, you got a humbug in your bonnet or something? - I don't wear a bonnet, Tinker. I wear a harness, and one of those dumb red and white hats with the snowball on top. - Hey, Santa's hat isn't dumb. - Yeah! Nothing about Christmas is dumb. What's gotten into you, Lar? - Or should we say Scrooge McDeer? - What if every sleigh ride doesn't feel like the first sleigh ride to some of us? Every year, it's the same old same old. Fly through the night in subzero temperatures, land on slippery rooftop after slippery rooftop, watch Santa squeeze down another chimney, or get the key from under the doormat, since lots of these new homes don't even have chimneys, we will then hang around trying not to be spotted while he takes his good old time arranging gifts just right. I mean come on, aren't you guys bored? - No! - It looks like you're overruled, Larry. The rest of us still love the holiday season! - Yeah! And I love it too! That's how come I care so much. I don't wanna see Christmas get boring for anybody, young or old, ever! - Then look alive. We still have decorations to hang. And new presents are popping up under our tree every day. - The countdown's on, Larry. - Soon it will be Christmas Day. - Some more creative control would be nice. After all, who knows Christmas better than we do? - Santa, that's who. And until he wants to change things up, we're going to celebrate Christmas just like we always have. - Yeah, with smiles and laughter and high flying. Ho ho holing high jeans - Christmas is boring you guys. Just booooooring. - Santa, I can't wait for Christmas eve. All my elf life I've been on a shelf dreaming of the day when I've been asked to join your sleighing. And here it is. It's greater than I ever imagined. - Ho ho ho Benny, I'm glad you're enjoying your first Christmas as a full pledged member of our team. - Boy am I! - As you know, making sure Christmas happens for everyone is a lot of hard work. - I can see that. I had no idea about everything that goes into it. All the little details, the pre-planning, the fool-proofing. Christmas is just perfect. - Christmas has been perfect for years and years Benny. As long as folks are smiling on Christmas morning, our job is done. And joy never goes out of style. Congratulations and welcome to La Chim my little elf. I'm happy to have you. Now, if you don't mind, we have just a few more presents to wrap this evening before you whisk off the bed. - Oh, I would wrap a thousand more Santa. A million even. - I despise this time of the year Clank, there has joy and the despicable good will. It affects the land every year. Year after year after year. Blah! - I agree master. It's a good thing we don't have to celebrate. Up here in the land of no, there's no Christmas here. - If only that were so Clank, merely knowing that Christmas exist, it make me want to crush their little party. This year I plan to do just that. - What do you mean master? - My magic foresight has detected a pronounced weakness in character at the North Pole. A weakness all glaring, I can exploit it for my own purposes. - Is it Santa? Is he finally growing tired of his role as the whole planet's gift giver? - Nah, Santa, he's a lost cause. He'll give gifts till the end of time. He loves his holiday to learn everywhere. Hard to must to ever betray his mission. The one that my sixth sense is feeling is another creature. A goofy one. One of the thankless workers who's grown dissatisfied and discontent and dismayed even. With his place at the North Pole. - Bah, humbug, no more gifts under the tree. Boring! - I can work with this type of gloom. - So rigorous master. How do you propose we use this gloom to our advantage? - I tell you how. This creature is so foolish and so pompous. If we were to put him in charge of Christmas, he will ruin the holidays all on his own without us having to ever lift a finger. - Sounds downright desperately master. - That it is Clank. Dare I say, this will be the year the fun of Christmas ends. And for this year, neighsayers around the world will forget the name of screwed and and dread, an all new holiday villain who ruined Christmas forever. The Mighty Bunion. - Wonderful job tonight, Benny. I'm very much looking forward to the sleigh ride with you. It's a joy having you on my team. - I'm honored Santa. There's no place else I'd rather be. - That's the attitude my elf, I predict we're going to do great things together. Now, if you'll excuse me, it's time for bed. I'm not as young as I used to be and a good night's sleep is getting more and more important as the years go by. - I understand Santa. I'll make sure the stove burners are turned off and the candles are blown out. - Thank you Benny for all that you do. - Good night Santa. I'll start breakfast at sun up and see you bright and early. We can wrap more presents if you like. - You know it, my elf. Here at the North Pole, there will always be more presents to wrap. - Good work today, everyone. I'm looking forward to even more tomorrow. - Who am I? The lead up to Christmas is more fun than anything else I can think of. - Except Christmas itself. Na-na-nothing beats that. - You've got that right, Terry. Each year around this time, I think the same thing. How lucky we are to be Christmas reindeer at the North Pole. - Yeah! - Buh, humbug. - Excuse me, Larry? I didn't hear you. Could you speak up? - Huh? Oh, nothing. I was just clearing my throat. - Aw, okay. Well, sleep tight gang. I'll see you bright and early in the morning. And we can pick up where we left off. - Okay. - Okay. - You mean what you're telling us over and over how great everything is and how lucky we are to do the same things year after year after year? Gee, I can't wait. - Hey, that's not the holiday spirit, Lar. - Yeah, it's Christmas time. - Huh, humbug. You guys celebrate all you want. I'm gonna take a stroll in the town. - You want us to come with you? - Nah, I'm my own reindeer. I don't always need to be part of a deer quartet, you know. - Oh, well suit yourself then. Trabby McCrab. - Sometimes I wonder if this life is the best there is. Now, if I could just be in charge of things. It would really be a Christmas to remember. Maybe you can be in charge Larry. - What? Who said that? Who's there? Just a friend. And your best friend. Perhaps your only friend. All the others don't understand you like I do Larry. - Who? Who are you? Come with me. My friends call me, call me B. - Okay, B. How is it that I can hear you but I can't see you? We are communicating telepathically Larry. Our minds are connected. We don't need words to know what one another is thinking. - Wow, cool. Isn't it, though? We can do lots of cool things, Larry. Things you'll never dreamt of. Or perhaps you have. - What kind of things, B? - Oh, fun things. Like taking control of Christmas and making new rules. Changing the way things are done. There are the North Pole. Doing things differently or differs time ever. - Wow, is that even possible? - With the two of us working together Larry, working in tandem, anything is possible. Anything you put your mind to. - Anything? - Anything. You are the future of Christmas Larry. And all that is required for you to seize your chance is to take the final step. - What step? Where does it go? - Here, to my castle. Not far. All you have to do is find me Larry. - Really? Okay, how do I get there? - Just follow my directions old majestic reindeer. You'll leave first thing in the morning and be here before you know it. - Wow, I'll await your directions, B. Over and out deer. - Joy, oh Joy! Finally, it will be a Christmas to remember. - Here I'm right where you wanted master. - This Christmas reindeer are a simple sort. He'll soon be eating hay right outta my hand. What's gotten into Larry, you guys? - Never seen him like that. - The hard work has probably gotten to him. He'll be better right after our Christmas delivery. - Yeah, nothing a few mugs of hot coco and marshmallows can't cure. - Hear, hear. - Now, let's sit the hay guys. I'm beat. - All right, don't forget. Meeting with Santa first thing AM. - Check that. - Top of the morning Larry. - Sowen, the Christmas cicada. - The Christmas bug Larry. I'm Sowen, the Christmas bug. I get folks during the holidays and don't let them be until the presents are bought. - Yeah and the last drop of eggnog is gone. - Yup, that's me. A bug some pesky Christmas bug. Where are you going? - I'm gonna train to replace Santa this year. I'll take over Christmas and make it the most amazing holiday in the world. - News flash, Larry. Christmas is the most amazing holiday in the world. Or didn't you get the memo? - I can make it better. - Really? That's a grand statement Larry, prove it. - I'll prove it to you. Once I'm gonna Santa and Chief, I'll make you honorary Larry helper. - Larry the reindeer as the new Santa and Sowen the Christmas bug as a Larry helper? That's something I have to see with my own little bug antenna. - I'm on the way to get my Santa credentials. So, are you coming? - Not missing this for anything. You got yourself a traveling buddy Larry. What's Santa say about you taking over Christmas? - Santa's gotta be so proud of me. - You think so? - How could he not? I'll make Christmas so amazing, his beard will fall off his jolly face. - That'll be another one for the books. - My mind assures that the reindeer has left the North Pole, Clank. He'll be here soon enough and plenty of time to ruin that blast the Christmas for everyone. But I also see a companion by his side. - A companion? Who is it master? - He's some sort of insect. Flea, maybe. - You should trim your beard before they get here master. - Nos es. I never trim this beard and I'm not about to start now. - Tie it up? - No, I'll let it flow wild and free. It's part of my important magic. - What if that flea gets tangled in your hair master? - Then I'll just crush it just like I'm about to do to the world's most beloved holiday. - Well, how about that master? I was thinking, I could take the reindeer's place. I can return to the North Pole and guide Santa's sleigh right into the ground. - No, Clank. We already tried that with your brother, Clink. He deemed off for a nobody. We'll proceed as planned. No discussion. Set the dining room and a table. Prepare a plate of whiz or something. Or whatever those reindeer eat. I want him to feel right at home. - Yes, master. - The end of Christmas is approaching. - Good morning my wonderful, hardworking reindeer. I so love seeing the twinkles that light up your eyes this time of year. - The same way we love seeing you get into Santa mode. Right Santa? - All part of the job Terry. But wait. One, two, three, someone's missing. - Hmmm, where is Larry? - Yeah? Where's Larry? - You know Santa, Larry's been acting strange lately. - How so? - He has been complaining that Christmas plays out the same every year and he's bored. - He things we do the same stuff and says the same stuff and think the same stuff and sing the same song year in and year out. - He said he yearns for change and wants to try new things. - Oh dear. What's gotten into him? - I'm sure it's just a passing phase, Santa. Larry's young, you know. He'll get his antlers on straight. - I hope you're right, Tinker. Do you think I should grant him the holiday off? - Goodness, no. - We need all the hooves we can get Santa. It's tough out there. The temperature, the pace. The amount of presence. - And the comradery. We never ever work a Christmas eve without everyone on board. - And we're not about to start now. - Yeah, Larry will return soon Santa, you'll see. - I sure do hope so. Gosh Larry. It seems like we've been walking forever. Are we almost there? - Hang in there Sowen, it's not far. - No, can we see it from here? Oh, all I see is ice. - Well, to be fair Sowen, eyesight isn't exactly your strong suit. - Hey, I'm a Christmas bug, I have other powers besides sight, I'll let you know. For example, I can make you wanna supp for gooey socks you'll never wear, ever! I can make you eat too much and really, really wanna see your in lots. - Those are fine powers to have, Sowen, indeed. - Hey, how long have we been out here, anyway? It feels like it should be dark by now. - It doesn't get dark here, Sowen. We're on top of the world. They don't get sun rotations. - Oh, huh? - Hey, who are you two guys? - Who are you? - No, we asked you first. - Yeah, you're on our turf. If we were on your turf, we'd introduce ourselves. - Fair enough. I'm Sowen the Christmas bug. And this is my good buddy, Larry the reindeer. - Hi, nice to meet you. I'm Flip. - And I'm Zoey. And this is our place. - Oh, mind if we pass through? - Not at all, we are penguins. - Friendly and sociable pack in the most, at your service. - You guys look beat. Need to rest your feet a while, have a snack. - Now that you mention it, I can eat a polar bear. - Make that two polar bears. - Well, come on then. - Flip, Zoey, what did I tell you being stray animals home? - Oh, mom, they were really nice. - Yeah, can we feed them? - Oh, I don't know. - We're not wild animals, we're-- - Please. - They're so cute. - I'm Larry and that is Sowen, the holiday tick. - Bug, holiday bug. - We're from the North Pole. - The North Pole? Ah, that's where Santa lives. - Whoa, Santa? - Santa is like, the most. - Santa is great, sure. But I'm running Christmas this year. Any questions or concerns, you can talk to me. My door's open anytime. - You? - Instead of Santa? - Yeah, Larry here is gonna propel Christmas into the next century. Something like that. - I'm on my way to get my official credentials from my friend B then I'll run the show. - No offense Mr. Larry, but you are no Santa. - Maybe that's exactly what this holiday needs. Somebody who is not Santa to make Christmas new and improved. - I don't think Christmas needs improving if you ask me. - Of course it does. - My penguin senses detect trouble at the North Pole. - So, wait, you are like the new Santa? - Yup. - Really? - Really. - Wow, can I get a polar bear or cob dog that talks for Christmas? - Yeah, and can I get wind up mechanical seagull that shoots poop? - Yeah, sure. - Can I have ice shelf swing? - And I want chocolate covered sardine truffles. - And I want an ice cube puzzle. Cool, and I want snow play clay. And I want a nice Frisbee. And I want a lock in yoyo. - And I want a pink icicle with streamers. - And I want a yak wool detective hat. - Wow. How did Santa for you so far, Larry? - This is odd, you guys. I'm worried. - We all have to stay focused, Terry. We can get through whatever's going on as long as we stick together. Christmas is stronger than anything. Always has been, always will be. - I hope you're right. - Ho ho ho, my reindeer. Why have you summoned me? - There's an issue, Santa. - There is? - Yes, Stella sent a message asking to see you at once. She said it's urgent. - Stella from the land of Ice Light? - Yup. - I haven't heard from Stella in a long time. It must me serious. - I wonder if it has something to do with Larry. We must leave at once. You reindeer stay here. Benny and I will go. - Copy that Santa. - Ah, whatever the matter, rest assured, we'll get to the bottom of it. This place is spooky. Nothing good comes from a place Like this. There's nothing Christmas-y anyway. - Hold yourself together Sowen, you're a flea. A regular vampire. You drink blood for a living. - I'm not a flea, I'm a holiday bug. We all have our specialized diets. - You do? Yeah. Anymore questions? And why is it so dark here? I can't see the tip of my nose. - You don't have a nose, Sowen. Santa, so good to see you again. - How are you Stella? How are the kids? - Fine, we're all fine. But I must tell you the reason I called you here. - What is it? - Your reindeer, Larry. He does a visit earlier. - What? What's Larry doing all the way up in the land of Ice Light? - He said that he'd be in charge of Christmas from now on. And that he was headed to see a friend named B for official instructions. - A friend named B? - Yes, do you know this character? - B, hmm. I think I do. There's only one creature who's had lived beyond this land and his name starts with B. - Who is it Santa? - I fear our Larry is going to engage the Mighty Bunion. - Did you say the Mighty Bunion? - The Mighty Bunion? Oh no! - Welcome to my castle Larry. I think you find it most agreeable. - It's kinda fall apart, yeah. - Quiet, tick. The Mighty Bunion speaks. - It's nice to be here, B. And it's nice to meet you. - It certainly is, isn't it? What do you say we start at the top and get rid of old barrels tale ho ho ho. Before getting down to Christmas business, eh? - The what? You mean Santa? - Of course, I mean Santa. Whatever old barrels tale ho ho hos, whether you know warrant the attention of a wizard as wicked as I. - Wicked oh, this guy look Santa look like a teenager. - Silence, flea. - Now B, when you say "get rid", what do you mean exactly? - I mean, making sure Santa is out of our way. Yeah, for good. - Like, for good, for good? - What's the difference between for good and for good, for good? - Well, okay, Santa's gone. Could imply Santa is gone on a well-deserved vacation. While for good, for good, is like, whoa, Santa's gone gone. - Is gone gone like a reindeer speak or something? - No, it's regular speak. For good good sounds permanent permanent. Sowen, you know what I mean, right? - I still can't see the tip of my nose, I'll let you know. - See, Sowen gets it. To play. I have no time for games Larry. Do you want control of Christmas or not? - Yes, but you're not gonna hurt Santa, right? - Of course not. Not too much. - Oh, right. I'm ready then. - Very well. This spell I now cast will get Santa out of the way, paving the way for you to assume his throne. - He doesn't sit on a throne though. He just has like a chair. - Four of them, wooden ones. - Yeah, around his dining table. - He has no reading chair too. Now that's comfortable. I sat in it one time. - Enough! A throne was just a figure of speech. I don't care what Santa sits on. - Okay, don't get your beard up all in a knot. - My beard is not tied all up in a knot. - A beard is so up ina knot that if I were a flea I'll start laying in the ground were for a snazzy condo in there. - Quiet, I'm going to cast my spell now. No interruptions. Wing of raven, beard of goat. Now you see him, at the end you don't. I have newtt and boy, old prawn. He once was there but now he's gone. - Is that it? - Yes Larry, that's it. - You feel mighty or anything? - I don't know, I think so. Do I look mighty? - Maybe like try to stand up straighter. - Don't worry North Polites, my spell's never missed their targets. Although, we are so far up on the top of this world, there's just a beat of a leg. Kinda like the live TV delay, you know. My vanishing spell shoot me taking effect right about now. - There's only one way I know to combat the Mighty Bunion's evil spells and that's to-- - Santa! - Oh no! - Santa? Santa, where are you?> - It is done North Polites, congratulations Larry. Christmas is, if you still wanna call it that, now yours. - Wow, that was easy. And Santa's in the Swiss Alps, you say? - Yeah, having a grand old time. Skiing and drinking eggnog. - Oh, goodie. - Are you ready to run the Christmas reindeer? - I sure am. Where do I start? Oh, right. Is there anything I can write with? - We're almost done Clank. Hold your joints, cling your chassy. Turn up your spark plugs. You should be good for another season easy. - Excellent Lag. You're the best mechanic of metal cell containing a magically guns an evil spirit can ever hope for. - No, thanks Clank. So, is Mighty Bunion really giving Christmas to that reindeer? - Affirmative. I was kinda hoping to get a crack out of myself. I think I'd do a pretty good job with it. - Negative. - I know Bunion always sees me as a heavy lifter but I could do more, is all I'm saying. If I just got a chance. - Are you entering our New Year supervillain potluck? - I didn't know about it. How do I enter? - Just give Bella a tow. - A tow? - Yes, a tow. - You mean like-- - Oh, wrap one off, put it in the hat. If Bunion picks it out on New Year's day, you'll be granted your own kingdom to lord over. - Wow, okay. - Are we almost done Lag? I need to use the bathroom. - Now I'm really starting to worry. Santa's been gone a long time. - Yeah, he never takes this slow on a run. Especially so close to the big day. - I don't think there's cause for alarm just yet guys. This is a special circumstance after all. When's the last time we had a dissector at the North Pole? - I can't remember. - Me neither. - That's because there's never been one. This is a happy place. Full of kindness and cheer, we've never known anything else. And we never will. - You think? - I know. - But what if Larry doesn't come back? - Perry, that's silly talk. Santa will bring Larry home. Even if he oust a dragon by the outliers. - That'd be a funny sight. - Sure would be. - We'll wait a little while longer. And if there's still no sign of Santa, we'll go find him ourselves. We have a Christmas to organize. - Okay, this is it. Christmas is in my hooves. Time to show them what I got. Santa will be so proud of me. - Ah, the power of Christmas is within you, yes? - Yes B, I feel powerful, all warm and Christmas-y. - Great, now it's time to enact the second part of my plan. - Oh, cool icicles. What is it? Oh, you leave that to me. - Check that. - When you meet your friends again, stay calm. And remember my orders. - Got it. - Assure them that you cherish Christmas every beat as much as they do. None eh, more so. And now that Santa's gone, it's up to you to run the Christmas. - Yes, I won't let you down. - I know you won't Larry. That's why I chose you to lead the most popular holiday the world has ever known. - I'll make you proud B, I'll make everyone proud. - Atta boy! Go get them Larry. - Hey everybody, I'm back. - Whoa, Larry! - When did you get back? - Just now, ho ho ho, Merry Christmas! - Hold it right there Larry. You can't use that phrase. - Says who? - Says Santa. - Santa is in the Swiss Alps having a grand old time. Skiing and drinking eggnog. - He is? - Yes, he deserved a vacation, don't you think? And as Santa's favorite reindeer, I'm in charge now. Santa's favorite reindeer? Don't make me laugh. I just had too much alfalfa. I might burst. - Hey, he always complimented my trot and my elegant antler. - Oh please, you are a slow poke. - You're limp. - And you ask for a bathroom break every two miles. - Well, nevermind that. I'm in charge now and Christmas will be new and improved. - But Larry, we love Christmas just the way it is. - You'll like it even more now that I'm in charge. Trust me, ho ho ho, ho, ho, ho. - Whoa, Santa's gone gone. - I see that. - You mean that goofy deer isn't Santa after all? - And now, the real Santa's gone gone? - What about my polar bear, cob dog that talks? - What about my wind up mechanical seagull that shoots poop? - What about my ice shelf swing? - What about my chocolate covered sardine truffles? - What about my ice cube puzzle? - What about my snow play clay? - What about my ice Frisbee? - What about my lock in yoyo? - What about my pink icicle with streamers? - What about my yak wool detective hat? - What about Christmas? It'll be here for all we know it. Without Santa, it'll be ruined. - Santa has obviously fallen victim to an evil spell. I know a creature who wields powerful magic of his own., - You do? Who? - His name is Baba Bartholomew Briskit. Bart, for short. And he may be our only chance. - How do I find him? - Sprout will take you there. - Sprout? - Yeah, he's a kindly tunder fungus. Grows around here somewhere. Hey Sprout! - You know, this place is really comfy. I never spent much time in here before. - That's because it's not your place it's Santa's. - Now, Tinker, what did I tell you about Santa? The Swiss Alps, remember? - It doesn't matter what you told me because you are not the boss, Santa is. And he'll come back, I just know he will. - Christmas is right around the corner. And we have yet to set an official plan for the North Pole. - That's because Santa sets the plan Larry. - I have some ideas of my own. - I'm sure they're just wonderful. - Now that's the spirit. Would you like me to tell you some of them? - Do I have a choice? - Well, nope. - In that case, tell away. - Great! First, I'm thinking of updating the gift giving dynamic. - Updating? - Yeah, we'll do email gift cards for those we don't care so much about, one click and they're taken care of. - How personal. - Not at all. That's the point. You don't wanna be stuck buying gifts for them anyway. They'll eventually see that they're never going to get a gift from us and they'll go away. - You can't be serious. - Of course I am. And for those loves ones who we do care about, we're gonna switch things up a little bit. - Switch things up, how? - I'm thinking of a Christmas egg hunt. - An egg hunt? - Yeah, we'll stash small gifts inside decorative eggs and hide them all around the houses. On Christmas morning, children will search for the eggs to find their presents. - Really? - Really, what do you think? - I think that's Easter. - Right, it is kinda similar, huh? - Kinda. - Thanks for coming with me Sprout. I don't think I could deal with the dragon all by myself, even if he is friendly. - No worries Benny. Anything I can do to help someone having trouble on the tunder. I'll do it. I'm a kindly fungus. - A kindly fungus? - Yeah, we're an arctic species, quite rare. We only grow on east facing ice shells in an elf dung after our major rain. - Wow! - We kindly fungus don't get to see many new faces up here so anytime we do, it's always a special occasion. - Christmas is a special occasion too. I just don't know if we'll ever have it again without Santa. Don't be Benny. You can take Santa out of Christmas but you can never take Christmas out of Santa. That jolly old fella will be back. Mark my words. - You really think so? - I sure do, come on. Let's find that bubble bob follow me whisket and see what he thinks. - Larry, I just don't see why Christmas needs to be different. It's the greatest holiday ever. It doesn't need updating. It doesn't need to change with the times. It doesn't need a brothel uphill. Christmas is perfect in every way. - I'd listen to him Larry. He knows what he's talking about. He's a North Pole reindeer. And so are you. - Just hear me out. How about this? Everybody's sick and tired of wrapping presents, right? - Wrong! - In place of gifts, we'll do a Christmas turkey dinner with all the fixins. - Are you serious? - Absolutely. It's cheaper, it brings families closer together, there's less waste and the dogs can handle the leftovers and their turkey bones. - It's also called Thanksgiving. - Ah, that's right. Okay, I have other ideas. - See what I mean? - Oh boy. Christmas is in trouble. - It sure is cold in here Sprout, and damp. I wish I had a cap like yours. It seems to repel wetness and fog. - You can't get one like this off the rag Benny. You're either born with it or you're not. - I guess I'm out of luck then, brrrr. - Not for much longer. Hey, it's Snag, long time no see. 'Sup Sproutster, I ain't seen you since ice old. Who this? - This is my old friend, Benny. He's from the North Pole. - North Pole, huh? I didn't know there'd yard gnomes in the North Pole. - Yard gnomes? I'm not a yard gnome. I'm a Christmas elf. - I bet they all say that round this time of the year. - Snag, we're in a jam. Do you think we can see your dad? - From here? Don't know. How far an you see? - I-- - I'm just playing with you. Come on, y'all, he's over this way. - I got it, I got it! How about this? We do Christmas costumes and candy. Everyone dresses up and goes door to door collecting goodies from everyone they meet. I know, I know. That's what they do on St. Patrick's day, right? Ah, well done, back to the drawing board. - What are we going to do? - How do we stop this madness without Santa? - How long do you think Santa will stay in the Swiss Alps? - Do they have eggnog in the Swiss Alps? - I think so. - Then, a while. - Updating our holidays. You guys, my brainy's on break. I'm gonna sleep and start first thing fresh in the morning. - Thank heaven for small miracles. - Oh, I got it. We'll fly gifts in on kites. - Hey pop, got some visitors who wanna see ya. - Visitors? Up here? Must be important. - It is, Mr. Baba Bartholomew Briskit. Sorry if we're disturbing you. - Call me Bart. Hey, you're all growing up fast Sprout. Last time I laid eyes on you, you were just a filament. How's Stella? - Getting fish like a pro. - That sounds like the Stella I know. Tell them my offer of a cook Alps still stands. Just not in the middle of that icy lake like last time. That was cold. Tell me there fellas, what brings you here? - My name's Benny. I'm Santa's newest elf from the North Pole. - Santa? How is that old cutter? - Well, not good. - Oh? Is he ill? - He's gone. - Gone? What do you mean gone? - He was stricken by an evil spell. And he disappeared. - No. - Right in front of our eyes. - Well, get out. - This is terrible news. - But worse, I love Christmas and even more, I love getting Christmas presents. - You know, way back when I was accidentally tapped to lead Santa's sleigh. - You were? Really? - I was, but at the last minute, Santa felt that a goofy deer was less scary than a fire-breathing dragon, it's there he made the switch. And that's how y'all got those reindeer. - Wow, I didn't know that. - Oh, we agree to keep that hush, hush. Tell me Benny, do you know who cast the spell that made Santa disappear? - Well, before it happened, Santa mentioned something about a Mighty Bunion. - The Mighty Bunion? - Is that bad? - It doesn't get much worse. If what you say is true, Benny, we have no time to spare. It's been a while, my magic might be rusty but I'm gonna try a spell of our own to counteract any magic that's holding Santa captive. - You do magic pop? I never knew. - There's lots of things you don't know son. All in due time. Stand clear, y'all. Illuminate this shadow, show the hiding place. Deliver before us my friend's smiling face. Blast it. Just a fungus from the grass lands. Let me try again. - I feel lousy, you guys. With each passing second, Christmas is slipping through out antlers. There's nothing we can do about it. - Now that we're seen as reindeer, we're not just gonna sit and watch our holiday go down the troops, we're responsible for bringing joy to households around the world and we'll do it again. With or without Santa. - I agree with you both and I also disagree. - Whatever do you mean Tinker? - I mean, melping around the North Pole, imagining what might've been, won't get us anywhere. And neither will trying to fill Santa's boots ourselves. - You have any better suggestions? - As a matter of fact, I do. We're going to go find Santa and bring him home. - We will? - Yes! Perry, you come with me, Terry, you keep an eye on everything while we're gone. - Copy that. - Thank you for trying. I understand if there's nothing you can do. - Nothing I can do? Gnome, you don't know me very well. - I'm not a gnome, I'm a Christmas-- - Stand back everyone! - Oh right, pop. Make some magic happen. - Hush boy, I need to concentrate. - Right, sorry. - Memories strong for my long lost friend. Break hove and spells and bring him back again. - Well, would you look at that? - It's another mushroom. - Mushrooms are cute. Way to go pop. I'm rusty. - This is marvelous Clank. Everything is going according to my plan. - How so master? - How so? I'll tell you how so. My arch and nemesis Santa is gone forever. And he's off for holiday survival rest on the shaky shoulders of that goofy reindeer, that's how so. - Others beings around the castle would've enjoyed the chance to control Christmas. - Other beings? Like who? - Lag expressed interest. - Lag? He never stopped opening his own presents long enough to get out of his room. And ruin the holiday for anybody. Who else? - Well, I also had some ideas master. - You? What would a recycled heap of metal held together by a magic spell, containing the imprisoned spirit of a medieval peasant? Possibly wandering Christmas. - Well, if I had the chance, I'd do a better job than that reindeer. - That's just it Clank. I don't want someone to do a better job. I didn't appoint Larry the reindeer so that Christmas would survive. I did this so it will be ruined. Done as by Santa's disappearance. Then finished off by a new incompetent leader, completely ruined. - Surely your evil vision has no limits master. - A world we saw the yuletide. Children without smiles, fur trees without the bubbles. Have you ever laid eyes on a fur tree without bubbles Clank? - Well, no. - You haven't seen nothing then. - I guess this is it Sprout. Santa's gone and Christmas as we know it is over. - Come on Benny. Let's give Bart one more chance. He's trying really hard. - Yeah, don't count my pop out, he's a top dragon. - He's great at making mushrooms, I see that. But mushrooms are simple organisms, made up of a mass of thread like form of mycelium. Santa's made of flesh and bones. I'm afraid that Mighty Bunion's magic is just too strong. - Too strong you say? Too strong for me? Ba-ba-Bartholomew Briskit? I'll show you. - Well y'all, move back, move bacK. Give pop some room. - Come on Ba-Bartholomew. Third time's the charm. - You think that I'm soft, but pop's no pushover. I'll wrap that evil spell in a four leaf clover. Throw a wizard across the ocean and have no fear. Santa was there, but now, Santa is here. - Santa, Santa! - I'm telling you, when we find that no good wizard, I'm gonna show him what these antlers can do. - What's the point? Fighting only creates more enemies. I think the world without Christmas is bad enough. - Don't let doubt drag you down boys. We're almost there. And if anyone can rescue Santa, it's us. His trusty Christmas reindeer. - Let's do it. - Benny, little Sprout, big Bart! And... - I'm Snag. And I'm gonna work on your sleigh one day. - Now, now, now son. Let Santa get his bearings. - Ho ho ho ho. A trip off the old block I see. - Something like that. - I'll keep a spot open for you, Snag. Yon just call me when you're ready, okay? - Okay! Did you hear that pops? - I did. Sounds like you have a better shot than your old man did kid. - Santa, where have you been? - A dreadful place. - The center of the Earth? - No, the Swiss Alps. And they had no eggnog. Lahowa! - Thank you guys for rescuing me. - That's what friends are for Santa. - Yeah, we keep it magical around here. - Well, come to the North Pole and keep it magical there sometime. You all have a standing dinner invitation. - Really? Oh, how cool. - We'll take you up on that Santa. But be warned, we dragons have big stomachs. - I know it Bart. I'll have Mrs. Clause start cooking now. Well, we must go now. I believe we have a holiday to save. - Yey! - This is so awesome, Mighty B. Thanks for letting me stay in your castle. - My name is not Mighty B, flea. Call me Mighty Bunion. That is my name. - Oh yeah, my bad. I'm sorry Mighty Bunion. You know, I just wanna say again how grateful I am for what you've done for Christmas. For a minute there, I was afraid it would be ruined forever. But your quick thinking and wise decision making has preserved our holiday for generations to come. - What? What do you mean? - I think you've made Christmas even stronger than ever. You may not get credit for that now, but you will. Trust me. History loves a winner. And I believe the Mighty Bunion and Christmas will go down as the greatest pairing since, since peanut butter and jelly. - I detest peanut butter and jelly. - Peanut butter and chocolate then. My point is, naming Larry the reindeer as the new head of Christmas even if he's a little green, especially if he's a little green, is only gonna make Christmas bigger than ever. - Oh? What makes you think of that tick? - Psychic psychology. People all over the world will relate to Larry's spite. The fish out of the water, underdog, thrown into a job he cannot qualify for. Succeeding against all odds, they'll see themselves in him. Get behind him, cheer him on. Christmas will be the big winner. So thanks Mighty Bunion. Thanks for saving Christmas and bringing joy to the world. - Joy to the world? We'll see about that. - Hey, look, here's somebody. - Oh look, mama, more cute stray creatures. - Now, don't try to feed them until we know what they are kids. - We are reindeer from the North Pole. - You're Santa's reindeer? - Oh, cool. Can we feed them now mama? - No kids, behave. I'm Stella, an old friend of Santa's. And this is my daughter Zoey, and my boy Fip. - I'm Tinker. - And I'm Perry. - We're looking for Santa. Have you seen him? - A search party is out looking for Santa as we speak. - A search party? - Yes, a kind tunder fungus. - Our friend Sprout. - And Santa's elf, Benny. - Benny's okay? - He's okay. - What about Santa? - Santa fell victim to an evil spell and he vanished before our very eyes. - Oh no! - Do you mind showing us which way the search party went? - They went that way. - That's right, they have a little head start on you but you should be able to catch up. - Thanks for your help. Come on Perry, we have a Santa to rescue. - Clank. I believe I may have error. - Oh? Have you decided to grant me Christmas controL after all? - Ha! Don't be silly. I'm talking about that reindeer Larry. I thought his natural foolishness will and make them despise all things of Christmas. But now, I fear the opposite may occur. His stupidity may actually be endearing and we can't have that. - No, we cannot. I concur. What are you gonna do about it master? - I'm gonna use a mad magic to take over that deer's mind. And turn him evil. Like us. - Wow, how utterly villainess of you. - I know right? I'll work Larry like a puppet. With the ridiculously crazy behavior that no one could possibly. By the time I'm done, everybody will absolutely hate Christmas. - Sowen, our plan might've backfired, now Mighty's more gang holed than ever to ruin Christmas. We have to warn the others about Mighty's new plan. We need to leave right now. - I agree, do you have everything you need? - Are you coming? - Yes, of course. - Then I have everything I need. - Oh. - They think they'll save Christmas today. I'll show them. I'll just show them all. Just wait till I get a load of me. - Hi, we're from the North Pole. - Whoa, Christmas deer. - And we're looking for-- - Santa? You just missed him. - We did? - Yup, my pop rescued him. - He did? - Snag's exaggerating. I merely did a favor for an old friend. - Which way did he go? - He went that way with an elf and a little fungus. - Santa's going back to the North Pole. - Let's hurry up and get back home too. - I'll see you guys next year. Santa hired me! - Ho ho ho ho, it's good to be home. - Santa, you're back! - I am, indeed. Thanks to the quick thinking of all my good friends. - Speaking of friends, where's Tinker and Perry? - They went looking for Santa. - Oh no! Now we must go looking for them. - Calm yourselves down. We're talking about Tinker and Perry. Two of the mightiest reindeer of all the North Pole. They'll be fine. - They will? - Of course! What I'm concerned about now is where is Larry and what is this business about him taking over Christmas. - At last, we're home. Let's find Santa. - I wonder if he's already found out Larry moved into his house. - And he's trying to change Christmas. - Hey, speaking of Larry. - Gabble dee gabble dee, slippery slip. Pine cords and acorns in your Christmas soup. - Larry, where did you come from? - And when did you start rhyming like a weirdo? - I've always loved rhymes and puzzles and riddles, will Christmas burn while the reindeer fiddles? - Okay, now you sound downright bonkers. - Mad as a header. - Tick Tock Tock boys, the clocks are ticking. It's almost Christmas eve. What gift will you be picking? - Let's find Santa at once. - Yeah, not a minute to waste. This deer's gone bad. - Santa, only you can stop the Mighty Bunion from ruining Christmas. - Or the Mighty Bunion who dwells inside Larry. - Oh, what a mess. - Santa, what shall we do? - Dark magic is afoot. And there's no time to return to ask help of Bart the dragon. We must act at once. Wait, where's Benny? - And now, using powerful magic spells, I shall destroy Christmas once and for all. - Wait! - What? What do you think you're doing elf? - I'm just an elf, I know. And a new elf at that, but I believe in our job here. And I believe in the North Pole. And I believe in Christmas. And I believe in you Larry! - Silly gnome. - Christmas should a holiday of cheer and gratitude and love and family. Not of gloom and doom. And I know that deep down, you agree with me. - Nope, I disagree, so sue me. - Look, I know we can't all get along all the time. But some things are universal. A smile, a wave. A pat on the back, a hug, a Merry Christmas. Can we just agree on that? That the spirit of Christmas lives in each and everyone of us and binds us altogether in the North Pole? Or wherever. - I find it hard to argue with that. - I'm losing power over that goofy reindeer. That gnome is making way too much sense. Wiggly Clank, go get some salamander breath so I make some more magical potion. - No. - What did you just say? - I said no, Bunion. - Bunion? You don't call me a Bunion. We've been over this. You call me master. - Not anymore, Bunion. I've done everything you've ever asked. Polished your shoes, built a kingdom brick my brick, breached castles, defeated enemies. For what? To be ignored and disregarded time and time again. - Ignored? Well, all right. What do you want? Name it, it's yours. You want Christmas? Done, it's yours. Do you hear me? It's yours. - That's too late, Bunion. What else made all the sense in the world to me. I now see the error of my ways. And I'm not on your side anymore. - Not on my... But I created you. You're my supernatural, magical sidekick. You cannot turn your back on me. I will stop you. - Just try it. - Very well, have it your way. Rusty bogs and squeaky joints. Downward bound your needle points. Molten steel and scrap iron heap. What you sow, you will now reap. - Meryy Christmas Bunion. - What? No! No! - Your spell's reversed. The Christmas spirit is stronger than you. Always, has been. And always will be. You're doomed Bunion and Christmas is free from your grasp. Noooooo! - Hi Benny, what's going on? - Larry, you're back! - Back from where? Was I sleepwalking again? - Oh, Larry, it's you all right. So glad to have you back. - What? What did I miss? Oh, I didn't miss Christmas, didn't I? Santa! There's Santa, hi Santa! Where have you been? - We'll talk about that later Larry. I'm just happy you're Your old self again. - Terry, Perry, Tinker, where have you guys been? - More like where have you been Larry. - Me? I think I've been sleepwalking again. - Ho ho ho ho. Our good old Larry is back. Now it's time to get Christmas in gear. What do you guys say? - Hooray! - Cool icicles. Well, well, well. That was a Christmas eve to remember guys. - Yeah, we delivered all the gifts on time. - Without a hitch. - Great job, everybody. - Santa? - Yes, Larry? - I want to apologize. I don't think I've been sleepwalking at all. - Oh no? - No, I remember everything now. I've been a bad, bad reindeer. I've tried to take your place and be in charge of Christmas. Will you ever forgive me? - Larry? - Yes, Santa? - I will forgive you. You are after all, my favorite reindeer. - I am? See, I told you guys! I'm Santa's favorite. - Yes, you are a slowpoke, Larry. You have a quirky limp and you ask for a bathroom break about every two miles which makes you absolutely adorable. I just can't stay mad at you. - Oh. - Look at the bright side, Larry. No matter what, you can do no wrong in Santa's eyes. - Yeah, unconditional love is the most amazing thing to have. - And Santa's unconditional love is the most special of all. - I guess so. - You're forgiven Larry. So what do you say? Are you happy to be Santa's special reindeer? - Yes Santa. - Limp, bathroom breaks and all? - Oh yes, Santa, all of it. - Do you still wanna run Christmas? - No way! - Oh yeah? And why not? - Oh Santa. I've tried to come up with new and innovative ways to celebrate Christmas, and nothing was as amazing as the way we've been doing it forever. Christmas the way it is. It's the best. - Ho ho ho ho, good to hear that Larry. - Oh Santa, being your favorite reindeer is the greatest Christmas gift of all. Thank you Santa. And Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas to you too, Larry. And Merry Christmas to all. - Merry Christmas everybody. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. - I'll be back. This is far from over. You wretched, all eyes haven't seen the last of the Might Bunion. Our return's stronger, scarier, mightier! And I'll step out your stupid Christmas cheer off of your face. - Ah, shut up. - How dare you! - And by the way, I quit. - What? Where are you going? - I'm going to the North Pole to be a Christmas helper.
