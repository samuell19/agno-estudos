You Tube - Video Running Time 02:16:10 You Tube search name - Pocket Maar - What's he done? - Picked someone's pocket. - What's your name? - Mukhiram Bairagi. Frisk him. Oh Goddess Tulsi... please do save us Oh Goddess Tulsi Whenever there's been a problem... you were always there to save us Granny! Granny, please save me. Mother's beating me. Why Malti? Why are you beating him? What's he done today? Today he's again stolen sweets from the sweet shop. I'm tired of this habit of his. Everyone keep saying that when he grows up... he'll become a thief, dacoit, and many other things. Those people are mad who speak like this. Children are very mischievous. My Roshan was no less mischievous. Whoever used to see him would say... he'd become a thief, dacoit or loafer. But today when you see my son... he's become a good and honest person. People who used to call him thief and robber, now... they give him respect and praise him. They keep saying they've never... seen such an honest man as him before. Wow, it's a very beautiful necklace. Your choice is excellent. It's one in thousands. Do you like it? Then let's buy it. Give it here, sir. Thief, thief. Police catch him, thief, police, catch him. - What happened? - Constable, he stole my wife's necklace. A thief took it away. Catch him. Catch him. Who are you, my friend? At least show me your face. Let the friendship of darkness remain in the darkness. So, is it all set inside? Yes, everything's set. And whenever I saw the world it was also set accordingly. And even the person who goes to jail gets set up. Leave me alone. Listen to me. Let me go. I've only borrowed money, not killed anyone For the sake of humanity may you all go to hell. Good day! I'm saying that some time, some how it becomes... a problem when you cheat on a loan. Sometimes? Have you lost your mind? Here, everyday and everything is on loan. Ration loan, clothes loan, tea and water loans, tobacco... and cigarette loans. That's why my parents have suitably named me Udharchand Dabbo. There's no doubt about your parents. I can understand Udaharchand. But can't understand this name Dabbo? You seem to be a man from the old generation. Here take. What is this sir? Every day you come 15 minutes early? Friend, that's my job. Wow, you've got really a nice set here. Color. Roshan? Say friend, how are you today? Oh! Even I feel like gambling today. Then play my friend, as life is a gamble. Then give me hundred rupees. Hundred rupees? Your pocket seems to be full today. A very big treasury has come into my hand. - Oh, is that so? - So, give me. Take friend, for you money is nothing. If there's treasure, I'll even give my life. Take this. It's five rupees less. For the interest. Deal cards for me, too. Sit, sit. What, friend? Come on. I'm out. That's all, 10 rupee blind. 10 blind! Here take from me, too. 10 and 10, 20 blind. - I'm out too. - You saw that friend? Even he's out. - So, 100 rupees game? - Yes, a hundred rupee game. Here, take, hundred rupee game from my side. Ah! No my friend, if you want to play, then put in your money first. Otherwise you might mix your cards with the pack. Money? I'll give you money my friend. - Grandmaster? - Coming friend. So, what's the matter? - I'm stuck. - Then why don't you play? Give me another 100 rupees. Another100 rupees? First show me the treasure you've hidden in your pocket. Is it even worth 200 rupees or are you just bluffing? - It's worth a thousand rupees, sir. - Really? - Wait. I'll show you now. - Very good, very good! Shake hands sir, today somebody else has picked my wallet. Somebody picked your pocket? But don't worry. This 100 rupees is a loan on me. I'll return it to you by tomorrow. You seem to be very fast? So Ustad, what's your plan. Leave your watch here. Then my plans are good or else. Or else you'll remove my watch forcefully? Something like that, my friend. Sir, what's the use of force between honest men? Here, take it. Take him and throw him out. Hello there. I said, sometimes by gambling on loans, you may get into trouble. What happened sir? You always had money in your pocket but... today I learned that even you also borrow money. What you're saying is true my friend, but... when I went inside... I went in thinking I have thousands of rupees. Even I went inside thinking... I'd come out with thousands. But we both know with what respect we were thrown out. Come friend, you must be cold. Let's go have a cup of tea. Come on. We're friends now. But remember this cap is on loan. At the corner we'll get masala tea. Police? Don't worry. I'll tell them. Inspector sir, we both were listening to a story. We heard a man say that gambling is going on in that house. - Where? - In that house. Come on, let's be quick. Come, come. It feels very nice drinking tea. After getting kicked, hot tea serves like penicillin. What did you say, pencil? Not pencil, penicillin, penicillin. - Medicine! - Yes, medicine Yes, after getting kicked, only medicine works. What work do you do? I don't work. I just enjoy myself. I eat from the money earned by this hand. The whole world's hand on one side... and my right hand on the other side. What can I say about this hand? Why have you become quiet sir? This thunder will keep going. This is the monsoon season. Drink tea and have fun. Dabbo, Dabbo. Dabbo. Friend, for the first time some girl has called me. I'm coming. Dabbo. Hello darling, come on. Where did you go? Naughty boy, come on. Where did you go? Yes, tell me, why did you call me? - Who are you? - Me? The one you lovingly call Dabbo. That's my dog's name. What did you say? It's your dog's name? You women have a bad habit. Just to insult men, you name your dogs similar to their name. - Shut up. - You shut up. Excuse me, madam, if we have a cat and if we name... her Vimla, Kamla, Flora or Dolly... then how will you feel? - How will I feel? - Like this. Come on darling, come on. Two eyes met each other Two eyes met each other and love blossomed One hand on the face, and it felt like a massage It felt like a massage See how sir's fair cheeks have turned red The man was left to sit alone The vessel was burned but the curry didn't burn The man was left to sit alone The slap hit you very hard And received a nice treat One hand on the face, and it felt like a massage It felt like a massage Two eyes met each other and love blossomed One hand on the face, and it felt like a massage It felt like a massage A cracker burst in such a way that it made a loud noise People have said the truth, that love leads to fights Even the richest who have fallen in love... Even the richest who have fallen in love, had to pay dearly One hand on the face, and it felt like a massage It felt like a massage Two eyes met each other and love blossomed One hand on the face, and it felt like a massage It felt like a massage You don't know me yet I am your guest Oh dear ones, the game of love is not so easy To keep falling in love the world has... To keep falling in love, the world has made it. It's a habit One hand on the face, and it felt like a massage It felt like a massage Two eyes met each other and love blossomed One hand on the face, and it felt like a massage It was like a massage Two eyes met each other and love blossomed One hand on the face, and it felt like a massage It felt like a massage Two eyes met each other and love blossomed One hand on the face, and it felt like a massage It felt like a massage - Son? - Yes. Why do you come so late every day? Is your office open the whole night? Mom, our business is very different from others. We don't know when can catch a prey. Do you work to catch a prey? Oh! Mother, you don't understand. We only call the customer prey. It's difficult for a shop keeper to get a customer. In the same way it's difficult for us to get a prey. It's the same thing. Just give some dal. Roshan, in your childhood you were very mischievous. People fed up with your mischief would say... "When he grows up he'll become a rogue." What a world. The world is very odd mother. Give me some dal. Hands up! If you want to stay alive then put your hands up. Whatever you have in your pocket, give it to me. There's nothing in my pockets. Okay, give me what you have in your hand. My hands have my life lines, friend. Keep that for yourself. Give me this watch. - Watch? - Yes, fast. Or else I'll use force. I'm an honest man. Why use force? Take it yourself. You really are an honest man. I'm dead! I'm destroyed! Early morning you started beating me. You, Dabbo? Friends call me Udharchand Dabbo. What's this new business of yours? What can I do, friend? Since morning I've been wanting a cup of tea. I got that, but this work is dangerous, you know? Yes I know that. I tried to rob you because I know you're my friend. Even if the knife really hurt you in the stomach... you wouldn't call the police. You'd just die. I'll tell you something. Just think how much I trust your honesty. - Can I tell you something? - Yes. I'm an honest man. You're an honest man. So why don't you help me? - Help? - Yes. - What help? You don't understand anything. At least tell me. Nothing much. Teach me your business. These days nobody in the city gives loans. Because of your little generosity, my life will be made. Okay, friend, you'll also remember me. Do you have any money in your pocket? What are you saying? If I had money, why would I allow you to beat me? Wouldn't I go to a hotel and eat? That's true. Roshan, it's the woman who slapped us. Just see with what pride she's standing. Last night she slapped us. I'll just teach her a lesson. A very hard one, okay? God, send this woman to hell. First she slapped my face. Now she's damaged my hand. Friend, she hits very hard, even from the photo. Every night in hotel Paris along with food... is Ms. Rita's dance. Life is very short, live happily Forget the world. What have you got to with the world? Why be sad? Drink the juice of happiness Forget the world. What have you to do with the world? Life is short, live happily You lead the way and let the world follow you On seeing you, if the world is jealous... On seeing you, if the world is jealous, then let it be jealous Of what benefit is the friendship with the world for you? Forget the world. What have you to do with the world? Life is short. Live it your own way Forget the world. What have you to do with the world? Life is short. Live it your own way Whether morning or evening, you should be concerned only with fun Why should the lovers also be somebody's slave? Somebody's slave This is how life is If you want to live it, live it like this Forget the world. What have you to do with the world? Life is short. Live it your own way Forget the world. What have you to do with the world? Life is short. Live it your own way I'm sorry for forcing you. This settles the score. Thief, thief, thief. Thief, thief, thief. You rogue. The friendship of darkness has come out in the light. Once I saved you from the police... now from a death sentence. Thank you. You took your first favor back by taking the necklace... but I'll fulfill your second favor. From your talk, I felt as if you were searching for a man like me. - Yes. - And when you saw me... you thought this was the jewel... for whom you've been waiting all these years. Yes, absolutely correct. Absolutely correct. So Shaikh sir, how much will you give for this jewel? A thousand rupees per month. A thousand rupees a month? Not enough? Then I'll increase it by Rs 200. Okay, Rs 1,200. - How much money do you have in your pocket now? - Do you want an advance? No advance. Listen, if you don't who I am... and I pass by you... then this two thousand rupees of yours will be in my pocket Now tell me, if I earn two thousand rupees in a minute... how much will it be in 30 days? But you'll be getting a salary every month. - What's the use of such money? Sir, whatever happens... I'm an independent person. I can't work for anyone. When necessary, I do business. Otherwise I rest. It's my principle never to get greedy. Earn less, be happy. - Good bye. - But listen. I'll listen later. Take this cigarette. Our score is settled now. You know how to settle scores very nicely. If we're not even, then do tell me. If it's another meeting you want, then you're being coy. Rita, I need this man. Only you? Ignoring someone's wish Don't go away you innocent man This opportunity doesn't come every day Stranger, it's not often that the mood is so harmonious This opportunity doesn't come every day The moth approaches the fire Where is the loved one going? The heart gets disturbed in this manner Try to understand the situation created by time This opportunity doesn't come every day lgnoring someone's wish Don't go away you innocent man This opportunity doesn't come every day It's not the same thing every time Not everyone is so beautiful The clouds cannot be depended on As it does not rain every time This opportunity is a guest for only two days There won't be the cuckoo's voice tomorrow This opportunity doesn't come every day lgnoring someone's wish Don't go away you innocent man This opportunity doesn't come every day - Daboo! - Who is it? Oh! Roshan. Wow! My friend, show me please? It's really heavy. Is it made of iron? Its made of gold, real gold. - Real gold? - Where are you going? To sell it. Even I can sell it. I don't understand this person. I tried to give him money. He didn't listen. You tried to lure him with your beauty, but he still escaped. He's a very strange man. He's not a strange person, but a marvelous man. But also a very stubborn person. One minute. Have you finished the work for which I sent you? Sir, please come over here. You may leave now. Why? What happened? All the hard work is wasted. Come let's go. What's all this? What happened? Three notes are missing. What's written here? 'I'm taking your three thousand rupees. I'm helpless.' 'It depends on you whether you think this... is robbery or helplessness.' 'I promise I'll try to return... your money when I can. Mohan.' - Mohan. - Who? - The one you recently hired for the job? - Yes. - Roshan! Roshan! - What is it? Friend, I have news for you. One man has three thousand rupees - Where? - Over there. I feel as if you're some news agency's agent. The same agency where you're the president. Me, a president? He is the agent for the pickpockets' news agency. - Oh! I thought it was the sewage and the sewage company. - Come. Give a money order form. Hey friend, come on, stand in line. Yes, stand in the queue. Hey fat man, does this queue belong to your father? Hey! Your father must be fat. I asked you politely, but you're insulting me. Come, stand in the queue. I won't stand in the queue. Give me a form. Hey, wait in line. Why are you just watching? Throw him out. Yes, yes, let's throw him. Beat him, beat him. My envelope, my envelope? My envelope... has three thousand in it. My envelope? Roshan, there's no one here. Nobody is watching. Open the envelope. Open the envelope and look Yes, there's something in here. They're thousand rupee notes. One, two, three thousand rupees. Thank you very much, God. What's this, praying to money? Friend, these days, I can see God in these notes. Give it to me, give me, give me. - Roshan, can I tell you something? - Yes. Now our life will be very comfortable. You keep talking about comfort. Let me see where this man... has sent so much money. Greetings, mother. Do you remember the day... when Ladoo Shah insulted you in front of ten people? And he said that if you don't repay the loan... then he'd auction your house? That day, to earn the money, I came to Bombay. I was lucky. As soon as I reached Bombay... I met a noble person who gave me a nice job. Yesterday I told him of our problem... of the unpaid loan and losing your home. And where would you go in such a big world? And you'd have to wander place to place. A soon as he heard this, he took three thousand rupees... and placed them before me, mother. I'm sending it to you. Take this money to Ladoo Shah... and get back the papers for the house. Your son, Mohan. Wow! My God, you are really amazing. When you give something, you give whole heartedly. These hands have never touched one 100 Rupee note... and today I'm holding 3 notes of thousand rupees. Give me that money. Wait, let me see first. Roshan, where are you going? Where are you going Where are you going, friend? - To return the money where it belongs. Don't make this mistake. Roshan, it seems as if a robbery has taken place. Not robbery, a poor boy has committed suicide. - Suicide? - Yes. - Who? - Mohan. - Mohan? What was his character like? He was a very good person. From the time he first came here... he was always busy with some work or other. He appeared to be very sad. Tired of his sadness, he must have committed suicide. Roshan, Roshan. Roshan, listen. - Where are you going? - To Mohan's village. To Mohan's village, why? To give his mother the money. Forgive me, I'm unknown to you. But I'd like to speak to you. Why? Am I not that capable that... you can't talk to me, even if I'm unknown to you? Say, what do you want to say? How far is Madhaopur from here? Madhaopur, six kilometer. Are taxis available? Taxi! Listen gentleman, in the third five-year plan... from here to Madhaopur, our taxis will go. Can you wait that long? You're a strange man. You want a taxi. It's not possible, not possible, not possible. It's possible, absolutely possible. Come here sir, this vehicle will start In a little while. Don't be afraid. When needed, even donkeys have... to behave like horses. Before evening you'll reach Madhaopur. I also stay in the village. Hey uncle, do you want to stay, or come along? Does your aunt stay here and is going to make food for me here? You'll get aunty in your next birth. Sir, don't be offended. All the girls in the village call me uncle. Come on sir. Sit on the donkey. - It's time to go. - I'll walk with you. As you wish, come on. Take, have some water. And wash your face too. Have some water too, sir. No thank you. I'm not thirsty. You're a strange man. You were just saying you were thirsty. Don't worry sir. Nothing will happen to you. Here, animals and humans drink the same water. Drink, drink some water. Take sir. There's a lot of water. To quench the thirst of the thirsty eyes You are an innocent traveler I have come from the fields I have selected the best crops and come My face is beautiful. My eyes are sharp Show your spirit once You are an innocent traveler To quench the thirst of the thirsty eyes You are an innocent traveler I am the queen of rains I don't know the story of a thirsty heart Come on to the clouds with your desires Sing some happy song You are an innocent traveler To quench the thirst of the thirsty eyes You are an innocent traveler I am one of the waves of the river I have the best place of all I am one of the waves of the river I am the heart of the waves My color is fair Take your eyes off my face You are an innocent traveler To quench the thirst of the thirsty eyes You are an innocent traveler Wow God, you give things on a wide scale. When you give, you give whole heartedly. You have quenched my thirst completely. Dabbo. Brother Dabbo, brother Dabbo, that woman is calling you. She's not calling me. She's calling her dog. - Dabbo. - No, friend, she's calling you. Her dog is angry and she's calling him. Understand? Now do your work. Dabbo, Dabbo. No friend, I swear to God, she's calling you. I swear to God, once I thought the same. But after getting slapped I learned that... she's calling out to her dog. Understand? Now work quickly. Dabbo, this time I'm not calling my dog. - I'm really calling you. - Madam... if you want to remain friends with me... then either change the dog's name or my name. So that you don't have a problem in calling me. If that's the problem, then we'll surely change it. Will you play marbles? No I won't play marbles, but tell me something. Why are you alone today? Where's your friend? Not my friend, call him a sentimental fool. He's gone to hell. I'm dying here of hunger and he's gone to return... three thousand rupees at a village. Three thousand? Yes, a sentimental thief. - He's gone to Mohan's village. - Mohan's village? Why, are you also from the same village? Why are you taking revenge so early in the morning? Beware, if you threaten us like this again... I'll bring the police. - Are you a moneylender or a butcher? - Yes, I'm a butcher. Then what are you doing here? Go to the city and work for a butcher. Tell that old women to give me my 3,000 rupees. Then what's a meat market? I'll even go the cemetery. Now you're talking sense. Die soon. Then we'll put the money on your grave. Not me. The old lady will go her grave. Who do you think I am? I'll get the police tomorrow morning. I'll take each and everything from this house. Listen Ladoo Shah, I'm explaining it to you in simple terms. Today there are celebrations in this house... and you're standing here shouting your lungs out. Remember, if I get angry I'll slap you so hard... your name will change from Ladoo Shah to Kachori Shah. Kachori is a very big thing. Even if you make me Rabri Shah, I'll still bring the police here. Cool down Ladoo Shah. You have a family. Don't you feel pity for this old lady? This is the only house where she can stay. Go, go away. I'll even touch your feet. Surely you can touch my feet, I'm like your father. What are you doing? You've put mud on me. I hope you're never happy. These girls, I will see each one of them. Is this Mohan's house? - Yes, yes, I'm his mother. - Who are you, son? I, I'm Mohan's friend, mother. Have you come from Bombay? Yes, I was going to my village from Bombay... and thought I'd inquire about you all. Very nice of you son. How is my Mohan? Today we're celebrating on his name. And he's sitting in Bombay. Why didn't he come? He has to go on a long trip, mother. Long trip, does he have to travel also? It's his last one. Then it's fine. He must be having a lot of problems in traveling. Never mind son. I forgot to invite you inside. - Come inside. - But mother... Come in son, sit down. Just as Mohan is for me... so is his friend to me. Consider this as your own house. You're here at a very good time, son. Today my Mohan has taken a new birth. - New birth? - Yes. Not only Mohan, the whole family has had a new birth. Today our past ancestors would have lost their name. I don't understand, mother. I'll explain everything to you son. First, eat something. I'll get something for you. Wow sir, you're also very strange. Why didn't you tell me you're my brother's friend? Was Mohan your brother? Not was, he is. Don't say 'was' again. I'll feel bad. I hope my brother reaches my age too. Do you know today my brother has escaped death? You didn't understand? Come on, I'll explain it to you. Listen, for the past 100 years... this has been on going in our family. Any boy born in our family would die before the age of 25. Our great grandfather, grandfather both died by the age of 24. My father also died at the age of 24. Just think, 4 days of living a married life. Sisters getting angry and making them happy. And then again those long nights. Sir, women would become helpless by crying. And then they used to pray to the goddess in the temple. Oh Goddess, if any man passes the age of 25 then... we'll donate food in your temple. We'll give food for the entire village. Sir, today is that special day. Today the goddess has listened to a mother's prayers and a sister's wishes. My brother has passed the age of 25. I hope my brother reaches my age too. Sir, you don't know how happy I am today. This evening I'll dance and sing. You'll also come right, sir? Why have you become so sad? Sir, listen. Sir. - Mother. - What happened? - He's gone. - Why? I don't know. I thought maybe he couldn't bear our happiness. And can't see our happiness. He's Mohan's friend. - You must have told him something. - Who, me? Watch how tomorrow morning... I take the police warrant there. The whole village will be shocked. Today the way Mohan's mother is showing her... happiness to the whole world by giving food... tomorrow she's going to suffer for even a small morsel of food. Nobody survives when I bite them. What do they call them, a snake? Your father made a mistake. He should have made your name Nagraj. Why are you embarrassing me, Barfi's mother? A name should be sweet. Like a Ladoo, which keeps the poison hidden on the inside. Now you do something. Drink cold water and go to sleep. I'm going to the city to submit these papers to the lawyer. And I'll tell him, "Sir, the papers should be ready by morning". - Ladoo Shah. - Who is it? That moment will not come. Here are your 3,000 rupees. Now give me those papers. 3,000, give it here. Three notes of thousand each. Today I have seen which lucky face. Have I seen my own face? Sir, but who are you? And why give me this money so early in the morning? I'm Mohan's friend. It's a very good thing. You may be his friend or enemy. My only interest is the money. Do you want something to drink? Hey sir. That was our house. Not one of your hotels from Bombay. You came in with a lot of pride, sat under the fan... had a look at the paper and took off. Nobody even asked if you had come from an orphanage. Do you know mother started shouting at me? That I must have said something. Tell me, what did I say to you? Did I abuse you, slap you? I must have said something. Or else you wouldn't have left like that. Speak. Ask for forgiveness for me from your mother. Why should I ask for forgiveness? Am I your lawyer? Until you eat your share of sweets... neither mother nor I will forgive you. Have some. Don't eat so much. Your stomach will burst. Give me your hand. Hold this. And open your mouth. Open. Take this. Between him and uncle Manglu's donkey there's no difference. No, there's little difference. Both are stubborn. Innocent beloved, bring me a carriage Without you I get very bored lnnocent beloved... I am tired of filling water Obeying all your orders, all your orders lnnocent beloved, bring me a carriage Without you I get very bored lnnocent beloved... All day long I am cooking food With my fair hands I have to sweep the floor Better than doing all this work would be if I die. I should die, I should die lnnocent beloved, bring me a carriage Without you I get very bored lnnocent beloved... From the moment he married me... he hasn't even taken me to a movie Not taken me to a movie Nor has he given me any lemonade to drink lnnocent beloved, bring me a carriage Without you I get very bored lnnocent beloved... Stop this! Stop this dance and music. All this is a lie, a lie. Good morning. Good morning, congratulations! Mother, today give Ladoo Shah so many sweets... that it's enough for the whole week. If you don't eat sweets at the time of happiness... then what should you eat? You said you'd call the police to have us vacate the house. How have you changed all of a sudden? Mother, I haven't changed from my own wish. Those 3,000 rupees have changed me. Ask me how? How? That man who is Mohan's friend, who has come from the city? He repaid all your loans. - All the money? - I hope you're not lying. Why should I lie? Those who lie, don't sleep well at night. Here, take your papers and give me some sweets. Hey. Hey, hey. So mister, are you someone in disguise? From the station to here you've taken so many roles? Why don't you say who you are and what's the truth? I told you I'm your brother's friend. I already know that. - What about the 3,000 rupees? - It's nothing. To keep one's friendship people give their lives too. Listen mister, you perplex me. Listen, look at me. See, if I don't understand someone's actions, I get very stressed. On the one hand you say you can give your life for my brother. I agree because you have repaid our loan. On the other hand, when we're celebrating for our brother... you stop us. You scream loudly and say, "Stop all this. This is all a lie." Thank you. I made a mistake. Forgive me. Let the sorry go to hell. First tell me, what's the matter? Why did you say our happiness was false? Is there something you know... and aren't telling? There is something. Oh God! Then tell us soon. You won't be able to bear it. You shouted so loudly, I heard that too. Then listen. I'm not your brother's friend. Oh my God! Then who are you? Whoever I am, I'm not your brother's friend. Can you see this hand? A man with such a hand can't be anybody's friend. This hand is dirty. Dirty? Not at all. It's your fault you can't see it. If you see the blood on this hand you'll scream loudly. This hand has been dipped in blood, Shruti. It was headed towards gold and silver but ended up covered in blood. Will you do something for me? Take my hand away. Amputate my hand. Cut off my hands. They drive me mad. Sir, may I ask you something? Are you mad? Yes, I'm mad. This one hand has driven me mad and left me nowhere to go. It has left me to die. I don't need it. What have you done? Come, come to our house. You and tell us your whole story. You'll feel better. This heart will never feel light again. It has the weight of a dead body. Roshan, wait there. Where are you going? A man's pockets are filled with money. Come with me. I don't want money. Roshan. If it's increasing then let it increase. Very good. If nothing else, it should be profitable. Roshan. Okay, we'll talk later. Come in, come in. Where have you been all this time? When did you return? Remember, once you offered me a job? - Yes, yes. - And I refused it. Today I need that job. Job? My friend, you're the boss of this place. - So, I start tomorrow morning? - Not tomorrow morning. Evening, seven o'clock. Okay? Bye. Mother! Mother, Roshan has come. Where is he? Where is my son? Without telling me, don't go anywhere. I cried so much, I was half dead. God bless Dabbo. He came and told us... you had to go out on some important business. Yes mother, that work was very important. If Roshan refused to go, he'd lose his job. - What say, Roshan? - Yes, mother, something like that. Son, this lonely house came to kill me. You get married soon. I want a girl here. Girl, which girl? Now it's no use hiding. I know everything. About what, mother? About yours and Kamla's affair. Kamla, who is this Kamala? The one you want to marry.. - Me? - Yes, Kamla. Daughter Kamla, just see who has come. Coming, mother. Daughter Kamla, isn't this the boy you want to marry? Come on mother, the food is ready. Did you see that son? I'm very lucky. Only a lucky person will get such a daughter-in-law. She helps me so much that even... our own girls don't help us so much. She is a form of Goddess, Goddess. Come in. Dabbo, what's this? You want to know how Rita became Kamla? So listen friend, your physique, your attitude... your beauty made her helpless... and she became Kamla from Rita... and for two days she's been washing dishes here. You're very lucky, friend. Nobody dies for us. The sweets are made well, sister. So sister, your decision? Sister, I liked your daughter a lot. It's a very good thing. I like your son a lot. God bless this couple. Daughter, seek your mother-in-law's blessing. A mother-in-law is the same as your mother. But a husband is also equal to God. First touch my feet. I want to see, after getting married... whether she obeys my orders or not? - What's all this? - Yes, sister... - the boy speaks the truth. - But sister... Oh God, is she a girl or a body builder? Leave my child. Mother! Mother, I'll marry only her. - Your wedding is over. - Mother! Wait sister, at least listen. Stupid girl, if you keep behaving like this... then who will marry you? Who will marry me? Mother, this world is very big. Somebody must be there for me. Uncle, when did you become blind? This is the coat of the big men. - Where'd you get it? - That man left it before leaving. How do I look? Uncle, uncle, uncle! When did you become my aunt? Since a ladies necklace has decorated my neck. This is gold. Where'd you get it? It's also his. It was in the coat pocket. Really? Let me see. - I look good. - You look very pretty. - Mother? - Go away. I don't even want to see your face. Who's telling you to look at my face, mother? Look at this necklace. Necklace, oh my God. This is made of gold. - Where'd you get it? - I didn't get it, mother. Brother's friend, that mad man, he left his coat... at Manglu uncle's house. The necklace was found in the coat pocket. - What say uncle? - Yes. And I also have this photograph. Let me see. Oh my God! So shameless! No skirt, no dress and to top it such a short dress. This is the trend nowadays, Sukal. The more high class, the higher the dress. What are you doing? I'll keep this with me. - You'll make pickle from this? - No. If God wishes then I will get your aunt very soon. I was laughing. How did I start crying? Mother, I am dead. Handcuff. I'm dying a dog's life, mother. What's all this Mr. Ladoo Shah. Tell us something. Mother, what had to happen. I'm a small man of this small village. And I have this enmity with the government. Shut up. Get behind. Mother, is it true your house was mortgaged to him for 3,000 rupees? - Yes. - And you've repaid that loan? Yes, yes sure. May I ask where you got those 3,000 rupees? Where would we get it? My son's friend came from Bombay. He couldn't bear our condition. He repaid it. I didn't see him again before he went. Please be kind enough to give his and your son's address. I don't know the address of either. How is it possible you don't even know your sons address? He only left for Bombay a month ago. Since then I haven't received any letters from him.. But son, what's the problem? That money was stolen. No, no, my son wouldn't do that. He's innocent. Roshan, you must have heard the names of the famous markets. Crawford market, New market, Share market... Mangaldas market, and the biggest market. It's this market. In this market lakhs of gambling take place... in the darkness. Keep watching friend, over the pride of this market. In this market, things worth thousands... get shuffled from here to there in the darkness. Here all the deals happen at night. Understand? Our friendship also blossomed in this darkness. And in that same darkness, I switched that chain. Roshan, I am the king of darkness. And what will I have to do? What'll you have to do? I'll just show you. Come with me. Two, three and four. Then all the money is mine. I have triple aces. Stop. These are his real cards. It's all yours now. Forgive me sir. I won't do it again. Shut up! Throw him out. What ever I did just now. Did you see it properly? Come. All this work will be done by you now. But Roshan, keep one thing in mind. That in Shamshed Seth's lair, gambling... black marketing can be carried out. But cheating won't be tolerated. Sir, I won't work for you. What did you say? You won't work? Yes, I won't work. I came to you to gain freedom from this hand. I thought you were a kind and honest person... a person earning his living honestly. I didn't know you were one of those people... who hides the whole world's poison of crimes. Just like you, my work was also done in the night's darkness. But I hate this darkness now. I'm searching for that person who'll show me the right path. I won't work for you. Mr. Thief, his whole life he's been picking pockets. And now he wants to leave it all. You'll get your bright light from the red light of the police station. The death sentence will bring light into your life. When a professional criminal says he wants to go straight... then he's the biggest fool. You're a fool. You're a fool, fool. Like me, you're all fools too. In the river of crime, you're all vulnerable. And to hide this vulnerability, you all stand together and laugh. But remember this; one day this laughter will leave your lips. And, like me, you'll also want freedom from this criminal world. You'll suffer to get rid of the felony charges. You'll cry and ask somebody to cut off your hands and legs... and to make you an invalid. You'll ask them to throw you in the burning fire and do anything they wish. But you'll ask them to give you a moment of respect and honesty. Even if it's a death sentence. Roshan, wait. At least wait and see how your lecture... has affected us. So you've really turned honest? An honest pickpocket? What do we goons have? Go along with the world, friend Don't repent like this, friend Life is short. Spend it in laughter It's the trend of life, my friend When the heart is young, the world seems beautiful Enjoy that life is momentary This spring of youth may not return again, my dear! Go along with the world friend Don't repent like this, friend These mesmerizing nights are very few Don't bother yourself with the monotonous Behind the sun of happiness Showers of sorrows await you All the rules are useless Don't lose even one moment, friend Go along with the world friend Don't repent like this, friend Life is short. Spend it in laughter It's the trend of life, my friend You did a good thing by refusing Shankar's job. But whatever you've seen here, just forget everything. Don't speak about it to anybody. Shankar is a very bad man. It's not good to have either friendship or enmity with him. What are you thinking? What am I thinking? I feel like strangling you. During the day you sit like an innocent women in my house. You made my mother believe only you... were fit to be her daughter-in-law. And now you were dancing among those hooligans. - Why all the drama? - You're so clever. You asked the question and then answered it yourself. That is actually a drama. When I went to your house, I was acting. Marriage was just an excuse. I went for those 3,000 rupees you stole from Mohan. Shankar sent me there. Shankar sent you? Why? What connection does Shankar have with those 3,000 rupees? That money was Shankar's. I stole it. I also wondered, how in just two meetings... you became so friendly with me... that to become my wife you came to my house yourself. Today I learn you didn't want a husband, only the money. Don't take advantage of my honesty. I already told you I wanted to cheat. It's because of your mother my world has changed. When she sings the hymn... goodness can be seen on her face. And then her motherly feelings... she fed me food with her own hands. As if I'm not any stranger, but her own daughter. Seeing her love, I had the dream of a new life. Something screamed from deep in my heart. "Open your eyes Rita, this is your house." "This is your mother." Say you'll accept me, Roshan. You'll take me out of this hell. Will you come with me right now? I can't come now, Roshan. Shankar has given me an assignment. Until I return the 3,000 rupees to him... I won't be able to leave. If you give the money back... I'm ready to come with you right now. I gave that money to someone. Now I can't get it back. You don't need to get it back. Whoever you gave it to, give me their address. Shankar will get it. - Tell me. - No. I can't give you their address. They need that money more than Shankar. So, does this mean you don't love me? Do I love you or not? What do you think? I only know the woman... who'll be my partner in life and death. I'll never betray her. If you want to marry this women, you'll have to buy her. You have to pay her cost. Get away from here. Go away. - Sir, sir. - Sir, sir! - How did you come here? - We came to return the coat. But how did you know you'd see me here? In the coat pocket we found this necklace and this advertisement. We thought we'd get your address from the woman in the photograph. Yes, and while looking for you, we wound up here. But, what you did was wrong. Why wrong? I've come here to meet my brother. - Take me to my brother. - To your brother? Your brother, the thing is that... Come on Shaku, I'll take you to your brother. Taxi! Shankar, did you notice something? What? The girl has the same chain... you robbed from Mohan and gave to me. Really? Uncle, I can't see, but maybe. I can't see either, but maybe. What is this maybe? What can't you see? Thief! You don't look like a thief from your face, sir. What have I stolen of yours? Before now, you haven't stolen anything of mine. But you've given stolen goods to others. Stolen goods? Who says so? We don't say so, sir, the police say so. The three notes of 1000 each that you gave to Ladoo Shah... those notes were stolen. Yes and the police have taken Ladoo Shah with them. That money is stolen? The police are mistaken, Shukal. Don't worry. After taking you to your brother... I'll go straight to the police commissioner. And the whole problem will be solved. So, you have contacts with the police commissioner as well? Uncle, not only contact... I'm their guest every other day. They treat me very well. Then you're an important man. One day I'll come with you. Uncle, don't you worry. Here's your brother's house. Wait here while I call him. - Brother. - Keep quiet. I'll be back. Who is it? - Roshan! - Call Mohan. - Mohan? - Yes, Mohan. His sister and uncle are here from the village. Where's Mohan? Our Mohan, his sister and uncle. Come in sister, come inside. Come in uncle, come. Brother, brother. - Where's my brother? - Sit, sister. Sit. Just yesterday Mohan went to Calcutta on important business. - Brother went to Calcutta? - Yes, yes, Calcutta. But sir, you said in the village... the latest journey was brother's last one. I did say, Shuki, but the thing is... in life and work you don't know when things will change. Don't worry. I'll send a telegram to your brother telling him to return at once. That his sister has come. And tell him his sister brought his birthday sweets. - Come back soon. - I'll write. Roshan, Roshan, what are you doing? You're hiding death from them. I'm hiding my crime Dabbo. It's more dangerous than death. When the time comes to tell the truth... it won't be any less dangerous. I hope before that I die, Dabbo. - Inspector. - You have to come with me to the police station. From your statement it can be proved... you got the money from the envelope... you took from Mohan's pocket. And Mohan stole those notes from Shankar. Yes. You must have read in the paper... that last March, the Universal Bank was robbed. Those men took 20 lakh rupees. They were all 1,000 rupee bills. These 3 notes are from that robbery. That's why Shankar wants them back. He must be stressed that anybody who takes this... money with them to the market will be immediately caught. Because lists with the numbers on these notes... were sent to all the shops, banks and markets. Then you arrest Shankar immediately. But to arrest him, I need valid proof. Oh, you can't arrest Shankar because you don't have any proof yet. Why are you laughing? I always thought before now that once you look at someone... that person would fall at your feet. But it's a very sad thing... that an ordinary pickpocket rejected you and left. No boss, I didn't reject her. I went to make arrangements for the 3,000 rupees. These are the notes for which you were ready to sell yourself. If you want to marry me, come to my house. If you want to marry me, come to my house. Thank you Rita, thank you. Your plan worked, but a bit late. No surprise. Even I'm affected by this poison. Inspector, at least give me a cigarette. Roshan, the trick you just played... are you sure of its success? May I ask you something, inspector? Think and answer. Ask me. First, look at my face carefully. Am I handsome? Why, what are your plans? You're very handsome. Okay inspector, if 10, 2050 girls are standing... and I go and tell them I want to marry one of them. Then will one of those girls agree to marry me? They'll hold a lottery to see who gets you, Roshan. If true, lnspector... then Rita will surely be trapped in my net. Go and sleep peacefully. Come on, I'll take you home. I'll go walking. I want to think things over. Early morning! You said, if I want to marry you, come to your house. - When will we marry? - Marriage? Now, this moment! - Come with me. - Wait. First, let's get mother's blessings. Darling, if you get mother's blessings then we can't marry. Why? Doesn't she like our relationship? Here's the problem. She likes this relationship a lot. She'll ask for a ceremony. Call the priest, stitch new clothes, make jewelry and for all. These preparations will take at least 6 months. To wait for 6 months is no less dangerous. What's dangerous about it? Now I'm all yours. Darling, before marriage there's a lot of danger. Why so? Do you again feel pity for Shankar? If that's the reason, let's get married now. See darling, an engagement and a quick marriage also take time. Doesn't it? You go home. I'll get the priest. Okay? Inspector Rajan speaking. Roshan, say brother, how are you? Inspector, we've got the lottery on Rita's name. I'm marrying her at 5:00 today. Yes. You be there at the right time. Yes. You remember your promise, right? Don't worry Roshan. Ms. Rita's name won't be mentioned at all. Ms. Rita is only a way of getting to the real culprits. There's something else. If I'm successful in capturing the real criminals... then my name will be removed from the list of pickpockets. Yes, dear, yes. Your name will be removed from the pickpocker list... and added to the names of honest people. Roshan, if possible, come here first. No inspector, not now. I'm going to the one I love. She must be waiting for me. Tata. Shuk... Shuk... Shuk, shuk! Don't scream so loudly sir. It hurts my ears. Don't fall fast asleep. It's difficult to awaken you. Where have Dabbo and uncle gone? Dabbo went to show uncle around Bombay. And I went to sleep, waiting for you. I want to ask you something. - You have to think and answer me. - Yes. I want to marry you. Me too. This is a new love You are my beloved Nobody knows, darling... of our story This is the time for new love... the time for confession If there is no world for us... we'll create one our own This is the atmosphere for new love I glanced at you in such a way that I became very shy When your heart called out, then I came Swear on this love... on this declaration No one knows, darling... of our story This is the atmosphere for new love Say, what you have done with all your glances? Who has filled up my lap with flowers? Come, let's walk to a place... where the earth and sky embrace Where the two worlds meet... let's make that our home This is a new love You are my beloved Nobody knows, darling... of our story This is the atmosphere for new love... the time for confession If there is no world for us, we'll create our own This is a new love This isn't possible, absolutely not possible. How is it possible? Sukun's right. Her mother must be present for her wedding. The presence of her brother is also important. Among elders, it's necessary for somebody to be present. Who is it necessary to be present? It's necessary for one of the elders to be present. Enough, who can be an elderly person besides me? How is that? How? Then listen. I am Shukal's uncle, I'm also her brother's uncle. I'm Shukal's mother's uncle. I'm the uncle of the whole village. - Of the whole village? - Yes. Come on, why the delay? The wedding will take place right now. Roshan, make arrangements for the wedding. I'll explain everything to the mother and brother. I'm an adult and won't lose such a capable boy. Long live uncle! You'll become the uncle of this entire city. Now you're my uncle too. Open the door. Police. Arrest him. - Inspector... - What has happened? - Rita darling... - Mr. Roshan... we arrest you for robbing the Universal Bank. Roshan! No, no, Roshan didn't rob the bank, lnspector. Inspector, you've misunderstood. We have proof. The three thousand rupee notes... Roshan brought to Mohans's house... were from those 20 lakhs. But inspector, I, I didn't rob those notes. The court will decide. Come with us. Rita darling... I'm very sad our wedding is only half complete. See this, tickets for a flight. I was going to take you to Kashmir for our honeymoon. But my heart's desires have remained in my heart. Inspector... Wait, wait. Roshan, Roshan. Inspector, if you learn where those 20 lakhs rupees are... and who stole them... will you then release my Roshan? Immediately, this very moment. Ustad, this is a very difficult thing. It's my business to change the difficult to easy. Any work I take up... I never leave it half done. All of you be happy, laugh. Rita! Not Rita, Mrs. Roshan. Mrs. Roshan? What's all this? What's there to be shocked over? A girl married a boy. Instead of being shocked, you should congratulate us. Not like this. Give them all a party. - We all should get a party. - You'll have one, surely. Congratulations! - Thank you. - Okay. There's also the matter of time. My girl friend, in front of me, gets married to someone else. And I'll clap my hands in happiness. And I'll say once more, once more. But the tone can change, too. My friends, when I tell you, you have to kill Roshan. And then instead of Roshan, I will marry Rita. You must know the secret way... - to Shankar's treasury. - Yes. Listen, please get there at the right time. Don't worry. I'll be there at the correct time... along with my men, and arrest Shankar and his men. Then excuse us. How should I come to your lane, lover? The whole house is awake The guard is sitting, guarding the house How should I come to your lane, lover? If I become a kite, I will fly and come Then people will cut the string This whole world will stop me But I will be yours finally I will never leave you, lover Never leave you If you meet me once, I have a lot to say to you Let the guard go to hell How should I come to your lane, lover? My eyes are striving My eyes are weeping I have no control over this world When the cuckoo speaks, my heart starts pumping My heart beats with memories of you Burns with your memories You come outside once With the spring of my heart Listen to my heart How should I come to your lane, lover? The whole house is awake The guard is sitting, guarding the house How should I come to your lane, lover? Mr. Roshan, let the time pass away. Each moment of our life, is our last moment. And each breath is our last breath. This night will never return. On this happy occasion, I congratulate you. This is also a matter of time. My friends, bring in the gift. Mr. Roshan, please accept this present on our behalf. My friends have made this present with a lot of love. Come on. No, no, Mr. Roshan. The cloth will be removed by your Mrs. And you will be stunned. What say? Why are you just looking? Kill him. Get away, Rita. Hands up. Look at me. You've saved your life, enough. But it's difficult to escape from me. Now this revolver has one more bullet remaining. If you escape this, you'll be left alive. Ready. One. Two. Three. Hands up. Mr. Shankar, we arrest you for gambling... and for robbing the Universal Bank. The crime of having a gambling den is okay, lnspector. But robbing the Universal Bank, I don't understand. Mr. Shankar, the 20 lakh rupees you took from the bank... give them back to me. 20 lakh rupees? I fail to understand anything. Shankar, if you still don't understand anything... then I'll explain it to you. Now it's no use pretending. I told the police everything. Okay, so you did all this to me? Just as you were going to kill my Roshan... and pin it on me. Now I understand everything, lnspector. When your own people ditch you... then what's the use of hiding? Come on, I'll return all the money. Thank you, Rita. Inspector, those marked boxes have the money. Remove them. Men. Take those marked boxes out. My beloved Roshan... whatever a person needs in life, we got it today. You are my lord and I am your wife. Lord and wife? But our wedding is still to be completed. If it's half done, then we'll complete it. I'll wash my lord's feet and drink. I'm your slave now. Inspector. Yes, what's the matter? Can a man in Bombay marry twice? Two marriages? No man or woman can marry twice. Are you planning to marry twice? I'm not interested, but you're forcing me to marry for a second time. - Second marriage? - Yes, I'm already married. You're already married? To whom? To Mohan's sister. What did you say? To Mohan's sister? And what was all that when you were marrying me? Just part of the plan. A plan? In the same way you played with me... to get the 3,000 rupees from me. Kamla Devi, in every game one person wins and another loses. But I'm sorry for your defeat. As I promised, I've caught everybody. Mr. Roshan, we're very pleased with you. As we promised, we'll request the court... and we assure you, all your crimes will be forgiven. - Thank you. - But remember one thing. If you pick anybody's pocket after today... then it'll be difficult for us to save you. Believe me, I've given up picking pockets. Good, very good. - Okay, now excuse me. - Alright. - Okay, inspector. - All the best, Everything is done, Dabbo. I'm taking Shukal now to my house. You also come with me. It will be worth seeing daughter-in-law meet mother-in-law for the first time. Shukal, Shukal. What are you doing here? Only what I should be doing. - Dabbo, where is Shukal? - Why ask him? Ask me. Mr. Roshan, your wife has left you and gone to her village. Have you told Shukan everything? Yes, I told her everything. Roshan, that sight was worth seeing. When I told Shukan... that Roshan was marrying her not because he loved her... but because he pitied her. Because he murdered her brother. - Her husband is her brother's murderer. - Rita! Why are you getting angry, Roshan? In every game one person wins and the other loses. But I'm not feeling sorry for your defeat. I'm happy. Sir, when's the next train to Madhaopur? The train to Madhaopur left half an hour ago. Half an hour ago? When's the nerxt train? - Tomorrow morning 10:00. - Tomorrow morning 10:00? No train leaves for Madhaopur before 10? No. 'Roshan is marrying you not because he loves you... but because he feels sorry for you.' 'Because he murdered your brother.' 'Your husband is your brother's murderer.' Shukal. Shukal, I'm the one who troubled you. You can punish me as you want to. Shukal, your brother did get killed because of me. But believe me, whatever happened... was an accident. Shukal, I was a pickpocket. It was my job to pick people's pockets. But I didn't know what I was doing... might have such serious consequences. I look alive to you... but inside I'm worse than a dead body, Shukal. Your brother's death has killed me, even though I'm still alive. Please forgive me Shukal. - Leave me, leave me. - Please forgive me. - I don't even want to see your face. - Please forgive me. Hey mister. Why are you troubling this woman? She's my wife, brother. He's lying. I'm not his wife. I don't know why he's bothering me. - Go away from here. - Go away. Or else I'll take you to the police station. I'm going Shukal. Maybe I deserve this. Who is it? - It is me, mother. - I am coming, son. Coming. God knows when you'll give up your habit of coming home so late. Now, change your clothes. I'll serve you food. No mother, I won't eat food. You won't eat food? Did you eat somewhere else? I didn't eat anywhere, mother. I'm not hungry. What's happened? Why do you look so sad? Why do you look so troubled, son? Mother, I'll tell you the reason for your son's troubles. Keep quiet Rita! If you utter a word I'll kill you. Why? Have you left me anything that I should be scared of death? Today I'll tell your mother everything. Who you are. I beg in front of you, please don't shatter my old mother's dreams. When my dreams have already been shattered... I'm not bothered about anybody else's dreams being destroyed. Mother, your son, whom you consider to be God... he's ordinary. Roshan, Roshan. Roshan. Roshan. Leave her. What are you doing? - Leave her. - Have you gone mad? What's all this? Why are you fighting amongst yourselves? Daughter-in-law? I'm not your daughter-in-law. I don't want to be the wife of a man whose hands are covered with blood. - What are you saying? - I'm absolutely right. Because of your son, so many people don't have food to eat. How many children must have died for want of milk. And because of this honest son... god knows how many had to commit suicide. Keep quiet. I don't want to hear anything about my son. You've gone mad. Yes, I'm mad. But your son is a pickpocket. He robs others pockets and fills his stomach. Rita! Get out of here. How dare you come here. My son, a pickpocket. Son, why did she say you were a pickpocket? You rob other's purses and fill your mother's stomach. Mother, she was very angry. Did you refuse to marry her? - Yes, mother. - Okay. That's the reason for your fights. Son, for a moment I got very scared. How can my son be a pickpocket? Whose mother while bringing him up used to always... pray to God to have only this one support to live. He has all the good values of the world. God bless you. God bless you my son. That mad girl's talk bothered me. And I was thinking son. How can a mother's milk turn into poison? Mother. What Rita said is true. What did you say? I'm a pickpocket. A pickpocket? You're a pickpocket? I've always lied to you. I always kept you in the dark. I used to thank God for your earnings. That money was stolen money. But now I've stopped everything. I'll die hungry, but I'll never do anything wrong. Please forgive me mother. Please forgive me mother. Please forgive me mother. Please forgive me mother. Forgive me God. Forgive me that I gave birth to such a son. Let go of me. I don't want to live. I don't want to see your face. Let go of me. I want to die. Mother! Mother! 'And I was thinking son. How can a mother's milk turn into poison?' 'I used to thank God for your earnings.' 'That money was stolen money.' Forgive me that I gave birth to such a son. 'Let go of me. I don't want to live.' 'Leave me, leave me.' I swear by you mother. I might die of hunger, but I will never do anything wrong. I've always kept you in the dark mother. But now what I'm saying is not a lie. The fire in which you're burning... I'll burn my hand in it mother. Sir, sir. Sir, sir.
