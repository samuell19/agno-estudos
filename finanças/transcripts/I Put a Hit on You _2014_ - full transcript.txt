Hi. Umm, I have a reservation tonight for Harper. Yep, for two. I was just looking at your menu-- Looks great, by the way. But, are those all the desserts you offer? Sure, yeah, I-- I can hold for a second. Hello. Hey. I'm just looking for my, -. There she is. Thanks. I'm so sorry. Hi. Hey. What happened to your knee? It's nothing. I just twisted it at practice. Well, do you want me to get you some ice? No, it's fine. Are you sure? You're wearing a bandage. It's good. What if it's sprained? Or, shit, what if you tore your ACL? Because my friend tore that playing water polo or something. And it was-- No, it's fine. Like, it took months. It's okay. I'm-- I'm really good. It's okay. Why don't you sit down? All right. Okay. So, this place got a lot of great reviews. Yeah, it, seems really cool. Hey, order whatever you want. Dinner's on me. You don't have to do that. I know. I want to. Wait. Did you-- you get another promotion? No. I just thought we deserved a night out. What? Nothing. You seem a little off. It's just a long day. Are you sure? I don't know. I guess, umm, I guess I just still feel a little weird about last week. That was just-- That was just a stupid fight. Don't worry about it. You were really upset. Yeah, I know. I shouldn't have gone off on you. I don't want that to be a thing we do. Fight? Not be nice to each other. Me neither. So, let's just have a great night, okay? Okay. Okay. I'm going to get you some ice. Wait. You look really great in that dress. Shoes are a bit much, right? They're not enough. What? No, I like them. I like them. I don't know why I said that. I really don't. Okay, I'll be right back. Is it okay? Yeah, it's really good. I just don't love olives. But you love tartar sauce. No, they're capers. I didn't know that. Shit, I love olives. I do know that. Help yourself. Fucking eat all of them. Hey, you didn't tell me why you were late. Right. I-- I found a gun in Finny's locker. Jesus! That's kind of scary. Well, it's just a Luger but-- What's a Luger? A Luger, it's, umm, it's like a old pistol that the Germans used in the World Wars. Yeah, that's still a gun. Yeah, it was from, like, 1920, didn't have any bullets and probably didn't even work, so-- So, he wasn't planning, like, a-- No, no, God, no. He's far from being a killer. He's just, you know, trying to show off to his buddies. God, where'd he get it? Well, that's the fucked up part. He got it on the internet, traded some dude for an old video game. You can do that? Yeah, you can do anything on the internet. That's weird. Well, you've heard about the paper clip guy, right? No. Yeah, there was this guy, he traded a paper clip for a pen, a pen for a doorknob. I think it was a doorknob for a gas stove and then-- I don't know, something for a day with Alice Cooper. I can't remember, so on, so on. And he finally got a house. "A house"? Well, it was a two-storey farmhouse in Saskatchewan. But, still, I mean, it's his. It's a house. Wow. I still haven't mastered emailing. I know. I'm having a really nice time. Yeah, me too. Is everything all right? Yeah, it was perfect. Thanks, it's great. Dessert? Love some, thanks. I'm going to go to the bathroom. Where you going? I was just going to go to the washroom. Can you-- Umm, can you just-- Can you just wait a second? Sure. Just-- something I need to say. Okay. Umm-- Being-- being with you these past 2 has been really incredible. And I don't know how else to say this, so... I want to spend the rest of my life with you, Ray. Will you make an honest woman out of me? What are you doing? Proposing. To yourself? Well, on your behalf. Are you going to answer the question? No. Hi. Yeah, yes, very well, it went very well. Yeah, yeah, super excited. So, hey, listen. We're here. So, yeah, can I call you back tomorrow with the details? He says hi back. Yeah, hey, don't tell Mom and Dad yet. Yeah, love you too. Damn. Hello? Who is this? What? What are you-- What are you talking about? Hello? Hello? Who is it? God. My God. God. Shit. Shit. Come on, come on, come on, come on, pick up your phone. Hey, you need to call me back, okay? Right away. Okay. Come on. Thank fuck. What's wrong? We need to go. What? Where's the suitcase I got you? The blue one for Cuba, where is it? Are you drunk? A little. Just-- Will you slow down and just take a breath? Harper, just take a breath. I'm actually glad that you're here. I need to tell you something. We need to talk about what happened tonight. This might not be the best time. No, I just-- I need to get this out. I-- You-- Well, you caught me off guard. And I handled the situation poorly. But what I should have said to you-- Ray! I put a hit on you. What? You put a hit on me? I think so. As in you hired a hitman? It was an accident. How? You remember that paperclip guy we were talking about? Yes. I was looking at some of those postings. And, seriously, people were trading gift cards for mortgages, like, fish fertilizer for picture frames and empty perfume bottles. Yeah, no, I know how it works. Right. I never thought anything would happen. I mean, you're the one who told me about this. You're saying this is my fault? Well, no, but you can understand how this might have happened. No, no, I can't understand how this might have happened. What did-- What did it say? What did what say? Your posting, your message, what did you write? I don't-- I don't remember. I deleted it. A rough account? I don't know, something like "I'll trade you my engagement ring if you kill my ex-boyfriend." Jesus, that's pretty to the point. Yeah. Can I have one of those, please? Promise you won't get mad. No. Somebody replied. Who replied? Some guy. What guy? I don't know, just some guy. Yeah, so, you're being trolled. I don't know what that means. That means that some random, lonely asshole is messing with you for their own amusement. Who would do that? Millions of people behind a computer screen. So, we're okay. Yeah, that email could have been sent from anywhere in the world. Somebody's just messing with you. And, as always, you're overreacting. He didn't send me an email. What do you mean? You gave him your phone number? I know. It was stupid. I just-- What the fuck were you thinking, Harper? I wasn't thinking, okay? Look, you basically broke up with me after I proposed to you. So, yeah, I was upset too. I reacted. And it was just supposed to be a stress release, you know, like when you write a horrible email. But you don't send it. But you do it because it makes you feel better. I didn't think anybody would see it. It's the internet. What did he say? What did you say? I don't remember. I had a lot to drink. You know how I get. Come on, Harper, just think, okay? Fuck. Umm, he said something like he saw the posting and he would do it. Okay, old or young? I don't know, somewhere in between. All he said after that was something about a clip. What, is that bad? What did he say about the clip? He-- He said it falls before sunrise. The clip falls before sunrise. And we'll make the trade after. Can we just get out of here, please? I am creeped the fuck out-- Quiet, quiet. I need to think. Did he call from a blocked number? I don't know. Check your recent calls. No, it's a real number. Great, then call him back. I don't want to call him back. Well, what should I say? I don't know, "Hi, forget about that insane conversation we had." Okay. Make it up. Don't yell at me. I'm not yelling. Well, you're making me nervous. Just-- What's that sound? It's like-- like a modem or something? So, it's not even a real phone. I don't know, could be, like, a fax phone. What? Who uses those anymore? Let me see. What happened? Same thing. What are you doing? I'm calling the operator. Why? Hello, operator, hi. Umm, I'm trying to find out who a number belongs to. Even if they've been harassing me? No, no, it's not serious. It's just-- Yeah, okay, no, I-- I understand. But this is just really important. Hey, just tell her that it's a life-or-death situation. Umm, what's your name, miss? Janice, that's my mother's name. I'm Ray. I'll tell you what, Janice, can we maybe meet in the middle? I'll give you the number. And if you see anything suspicious, you just let me know. And if not, then I will, I'll just-- I'll let you get back to it. Please. I appreciate that so much. I'm just going to put you on speakerphone, okay? Janice, are you there? Yes. Okay, the number is 455, 8769. Janice? Yes, that number appears to be a payphone. Bollocks. What is it? Nobody good uses a fucking payphone. Well, it could be anywhere though. Janice, do you know where that phone is? That information is confidential, Ray. Please, I'm not going to tell anyone, okay? Just, please, this is really important. 1st and Baker. That's four blocks away. Thank you, Janice. Is there anything else I can help-- Now can we go? Maybe we could go to your parents' house. That's weird. Okay, then we can stay at a motel. No. Well, all right, where do you think we should go? We are not going anywhere. You don't want me to come? I don't know, Harper. I'm a little fucking confused about my feelings for you right now. I didn't tell him where you live. No, you didn't need to. I mean, the guy, he could have done a reverse lookup on your-- on your number, found out your name, seen that we were in a relationship, then found my address. I mean, the dumbest kids in my class could have figured that-- Okay, I'm sorry. Why did you even propose? Don't act like we haven't talked about marriage before. No, we talked about talking about marriage. We don't even live together. That's on you. Yeah, because I didn't know if I was ready for that level of commitment. I mean, if you'd just been a little bit patient-- "Patient"? If I waited for you to do it, I'd be 90. I'm going to spend the night at Ben's, just as a precaution. Fine. You should do the same. What do you mean? Well, you can't go home. Why not? 'Cause it's not safe. I thought you said that this was just a precaution. It is. Well, where am I supposed to go? I don't know, anywhere. Go to Lenae's. Will you call me? I don't know. Wait. Wait. What? Let's take the back exit. We never take the back exit. I know. That's fucking weird. What's weird? No, no, no, wait. Wait. Just back up slowly. You're freaking me out. What time did you place that ad? I'm not sure. I-- I passed out. 45 minutes ago? An hour? A couple hours ago? A couple hours, I guess. Bollocks. What? I saw that same van parked out front of my apartment 45 minutes ago, just sitting there. What were you doing outside? I was just getting some air. It's the middle of the night. So? So, that just seems kind of out of character. Yeah, so does hiring a hitman. Okay, got it. I didn't think anything about it. But what if that's the guy? Like he's been watching you? Maybe, yeah. My God. Let's just get out of here. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Why not? Because that's exactly what he wants. Maybe he knows about my knee. Your knee? I don't know. Trust me. We're just safer inside. Okay, maybe if-- if we got the license plate number, we could report a suspicious vehicle. Good thinking. Watch my back. Do you think he saw you? Yes. Come on, come on. The door's unlocked. I thought you locked it. So did I. Do you think it's him? There's no way that he could have beaten us here from the van unless-- Unless what? Unless he's not working alone. What? Stay here. No. No. Fine then, just stay close. Okay. Be cool. Harper? Harper! Whoa! Come on, we need to secure this place. If you see or hear anyone coming, just say something, like, "Good morning, sweetheart." What does that mean? You okay? Fuck, that's hot. It's a code that means that someone's coming. It could come in handy. Okay. What if somebody steps on that? Right. Little help? What are you doing? I'm calling the cops. You can't call the cops. Why not? Because you'll be charged with attempted manslaughter. It was an accident. You'll go to jail. It's that simple. No, you don't know that. I minored in Law. You took one course. How many'd you take? None. But if OJ and fucking Matthew Broderick can get away with killing people-- Matthew Broderick never killed anyone. No, not on purpose. But he was in a car crash in Ireland that killed two people. When? I don't know, the '80s. He was with Jennifer Grey. From Dirty Dancing. Yes. Point is he was charged, like, 200 bucks. That's it. But they're celebrities. You're-- You're not. You're a regular, everyday person who will be locked behind bars forever. Please, put it down. Thank you. Put this on. What's this for? Protection. What are you looking for? We need weapons. What kind of weapons? Anything, just get creative. Well, what exactly do you think is going to happen? I don't know. All I know is that this guy is crazy enough to answer some hysterical woman's ad online. I wasn't hysterical. You tried to have me killed. I was venting. And I'm preparing for the worst. So, I suggest that you find something to defend yourself with. Where do you keep your knives? In the middle drawer. No, the other one. Is this all you have? Yeah. Well, it works fine if you know how to hold it right. Yeah, or you could have just bought a new knife like you said you would do eight months ago. Yeah, well, I didn't get around to it. Well, it's not that hard. You could have just come by the store. There's a lot of knives that-- Can we just not make a big deal about-- Yeah, okay. It's no big deal. I'm just going to check the bedroom. Find anything? Not yet. Do you think he's still out there? I don't know. Here. What if we're going about this all wrong? What if-- You mind turning around? Yeah, umm, I just-- I think that maybe we should get another opinion, you know? I'm not sure that there is a right way to handle this. Well, your brother's a lawyer. He only deals in divorce. What about Ben? No. Why not? He's not that smart. Yeah. We could call my dad. We're not calling your dad. Why? Because he'll freak out. Look, we need the least amount of people involved as possible. Trust me. It's better this way. Yeah, but he might actually know what to do. This is not a paint colour or a barbecue assembly. This is a hitman we're talking about. And unless you know that your dad has some sort of specific experience with this, which I'm guessing that he doesn't, just let me handle this. Okay, fine. What are you doing? Seeing if he emailed. Did he ever email you? No. I took the ad down. I just want to be sure. Fuck. What? Post another ad. You're not serious. I'm completely serious. Saying what? Saying cancel the hit! Do you think he'll get it? He got the first one. Don't hover. What'd you write? Okay... "To the man that called me earlier, "please disregard my previous post. "I was joking. I do not want my boyfriend assassinated." No, no, no. Don't say "assassinated." It just reconnects you to the crime. I know what I'm doing. You need to be more cryptic. You need to say something along the lines of, "I most definitely do not want the actions--" No, no, this is better: "Do not let the clip fall." Do you think he'll understand? He made it up. What? I just-- It sounds evasive. So... So customers hate it when you don't use clear, positive language. It makes them feel like you don't understand them, or that you're being condescending. This isn't exactly the same thing. I just don't wanna come across as cold. I don't doubt your expertise in customer relations, but this guy's not shopping for a throw rug or home decor. Right. "Please email--" Or call. You wanna write this? No, you're doing great. You're doing really great. "Please email or call to confirm at your earliest convenience. Give him my number too. 5-5-1-0. Yeah, right. I know your number. "Thank you for your understanding." That's great, yeah. Post it. Anything? No. Refresh? I just did. What are all those? They're nothing. They're just replies from my previous post-- Don't! "You're fucking insane. You deserve to die alone." "Good luck on life." "You sound hot. Do you wanna hook up tonight?" All right. That's enough of that. No, I mean, I think there's a few more here we could kinda check out. Don't... move... Do you see anything? No. You're not expecting anyone? It's 4:00 a.m. Maybe he got the message. Maybe he didn't. Hello? Is Margaret there? Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me? Margaret's the buzzer below this one. Okay. Jesus Christ... My heart is pounding. We need to see if he's still out there. I'm not going out there. On the count of three, just your head. Got it. One... Two... Three. He's just sitting there. Maybe it's not him. What? White van? Black boots? It's him. Maybe, but we don't know for sure. Well, who else just sits in a white van, in the middle of the night, outside an apartment building? Could be a plumber. At this hour? Yeah, there's leaks in this shitty building all the time. Well, if he's a plumber, then why isn't he inside the shitty building, fixing toilets? Maybe he's waiting for the landlord. I don't know. That's stupid. Do you think he saw us? I don't know. Shit. What do we do? I'm gonna go talk to him. No, you're not. Yeah, I'm gonna go down there, and I'm gonna face him, man to man. We need to be sure. What if it's actually him. What are you going to say? The truth! We don't know anything about this guy. I need to do this. Will you help me? Yeah. Okay, take me through it. This is me. This is you. Great. First thing I do is exit out the back, and casually approach the van, driver's side. Good. Are you sure he won't know who I am? How could he? I don't know. He could've done a quick search and seen me on my work's website. But it's dark. Do you remember that Christmas party when that photographer wouldn't stop taking pictures of me? I have asked them over and over to just delete-- Okay, okay, we'll get you a disguise, okay? Okay. Can we just keep going? Yeah... Yeah, once I approach the van, I casually tap on the window, wait for him to roll it down, and ask for a cigarette. Great, now, while you're doing that, you do a quick sweep. Surveillance. You're looking for anything suspicious. A gun, sharp objects, anything. I don't know. You'll know it when you see it. Okay, got it. Great, now, while you're doing that, I am gonna sneak in from behind, and position myself right here, out of sight. If I see anything, I tap once. Two taps if I don't. Perfect. What do we do if it's him? Like, really him. What are you gonna say? I'll know when the moment comes. How? I mean, it's primal. My instincts will take over. It doesn't hurt to have a solid plan. Don't make this a thing. No, I'm not, but-- But? Sometimes you do things kind of half-assed. This is not the time to be talking about this. I'm sorry, but it's just-- he could be really dangerous. That's all I'm saying. I mean, aren't you scared? Everything is gonna be fine, okay? I'm gonna take care of it. Okay. I have to use the bathroom. Hey. Hey, sorry to wake you guys. Yeah, no, Mom, everything's fine. Yeah, I just-- Well, it's-- It's 5:00, or something. Mom, Mom, I'm not drunk. Yeah, I'm sure. I'm sure. Listen, um... I was just wondering what you guys want for Christmas. Yeah, I... I was making a list, so I... Um, I'm not sure if Harper's gonna be able to make it, because she's, you know, working and stuff, and it's pretty crazy this time of year. Yeah, no, yeah, she did have it off, but-- We'll just-- gonna have to wait and see, okay? Listen, um... I shouldn't have called this late. This can wait till tomorrow. Mom, everything's fine. Mom... I promise. Get back to sleep, okay? I love you guys. You can do this. If anything goes really wrong, we just run. Got me? This never happened. You were never involved. I'm not just leaving you there. I'm not asking. Why are you smiling? I don't know. This is crazy! I need you to focus up. I am. I am. This is really serious business. Yeah, I know. I'm good. You ready? Yeah. I'm gonna count again, okay? Okay. One. Two. Three. I think he's gone. Stay close. See anything? No. You? No. It's all clear. Yeah. What happened? It's, nothing. I tripped. When? As soon as I stepped out of the door. My legs kind of got scared. Come on. Do you think we're safe? Yeah, I think so. So, this whole night was probably nothing, right? I wouldn't say it was nothing. Right. You want a beer? Yeah, sure, why not? How are your parents? You heard that? A little. I think I just worried them. I like your parents. Well, they really like you. What happened to us? Well, maybe we should talk about it. Now? It might help. If you want to. You waiting for me to start? Yeah. No. You first. I always start. What do you want me to say? Say anything! Let's just be honest with each other. Don't censor yourself. Okay. I feel like you're always trying to change me. How? I don't know, like, change the way I dress. You're always making me buy shit that's gay. What? How is it gay? Sorry, no, not gay. Tight. My jeans are so tight that I have to wear the tensor bandage on the top. They're not that tight. When I first met you, you were wearing jeans that were four sizes too big. Yeah, well, I liked them. Well, you looked hideous in them. There it is. There it is. What? Sometimes you can be so fucking mean. I mean, I just don't know how else to say it. No, no, no. Don't do that. Do what? Play the victim. Am I? Yes! Most of the time, you are so lovely, but then, sometimes, you just say shit that cuts, and I hate it. Like what? Like shit that attacks my character. You're always judging my lifestyle, my house-- Okay, give me an example. Are you serious? I'm not being difficult. I'm not. Just, um, a point of reference. Anything. It's how I learn. My apartment's dirty. I'm sorry, but it usually is. What else? I smoke too much weed. You're a teacher. My knives are too dull. I don't like international cuisine as much as you do. I don't have access to a cottage in the summer. I'm probably never gonna be as successful as your father. And if you waited for me to propose, we'd probably be 90. But I can keep on going. I'm sorry if I'm hard on you, but don't pretend that you don't like it. Well, I don't. You do! No, I'm pretty sure that I don't. You know what? I do push you, but that's because I know there's more to you. If you didn't like that, you wouldn't be with me in the first place. It would just be nice if you were a little less intense sometimes. It would be nice if I didn't have to challenge you on everything. Okay? It'd be nice if you would make the first move for a fucking change! I wouldn't have to wait for you to ask me to do things, and I wouldn't always have to prompt you, that you would fucking take care of your knee. I just feel like we're stuck. Wait... Do you hear that? Get the lights. Just Carl. Hey. Is it him? No. Do you recognize the number? It's nothing. Who is it? It's Alison. The English teacher? Why is she calling you so late? I... it's probably a pocket dial. I do that kind of stuff all the time. Well, maybe you should call her back. No. No need. Well, if I was calling somebody in the middle of the night, I'd want them to pick up. Maybe it's about what happened at school. I'm sure it's nothing. Do you want another one? No. You're acting weird. You're acting weird. This whole night is weird. No. No, even at dinner, you seemed off. My knee hurt. I think you're reading way too much into this. Am I? Yes. Is something going on with the two of you? What are you talking about? Just answer the question. No. It's an inane question. You know that-- that we're colleagues, that we hang out. We're buddies. Ray... Fuck. My god. It's not what you think. Are you fucking her? How long has this been going on? It's not going on. And you just hoped you'd get away with it. Is that it? My plan was to tell you at dinner. Amazing. You're amazing. This whole night I've been the bad guy because you didn't cheat! Okay, please, just-- Would you calm down? Let me explain. Fuck you. Fuck this. Okay, look... Last week, after our fight... I went with some teachers from school. Your weekly girls' night? Yes, you know it's mostly women at my school. We went out to the bar, we had a little too much to drink, and Allison and I, we accidentally... we kissed in the parking lot. Is that it? That's it. And it really wasn't that big a deal. Kissing someone who isn't your girlfriend isn't a big deal? You know what I mean. Do you love her? No, of course not! I love you. Then why is she calling you? I don't know. We met up tonight, and maybe she still had some things she wanted to discuss. Honestly, I don't know, and I don't care. You met her tonight?! Yeah, but-- When?! About an hour before you came over. And that's why you were outside. Yes. What happened? Nothing! Nothing happened. I told her that I didn't want to take this thing any further, that I'd made a huge mistake. And? And nothing. That's it. I swear. I am so sorry-- Shut up. Wait. Wait! Tell me what happened. I did. Detail for detail. Can we just take a breath? We've both done some things we regret tonight. No. I want you to explain. This is stupid. Like I said, we were out for a bit. Yeah, I know that part. Right. And I... I was walking her to the street to catch a cab, but before we got there, she... put a move on me. What kind of move? I don't know... She pushed me up against the wall of the restaurant. It happened really quick. I don't know what to say. What are you doing? Like this? Can we please stop? Just answer the question. Is this how it started? Yeah. Yeah, more or less. Show me where your hands were. Come on. Don't make me ask you again. Then what? Then we kissed. Soft? Hard? What? I don't know, soft. Like this? Pretty close, yeah. And then I told her to stop. But she didn't, did she? No. No. What did she do? She, she told me that she wasn't wearing any underwear. Then what? What? I'm so sorry. I wish the hitman was real. Argh! Hello? Good morning. Good morning! Just come back inside. No! Ray! Good morning sweetheart! Are you okay? He's coming. Wait, wait! What did you see? Go! Aah! Ray, shh! Come on! Lock the door! Are you sure that it's him? He's wearing a ski mask, and he has a gun. It's him. It's gonna be okay. We're in my apartment. Nothing is gonna happen. Okay. Ray... My god... What's he doing? He's coming in. Go, go, go! Here. Help me move this. What's he doing now? I don't know. We can jump. It's not that far. We can't jump. It's too high. We can't just sit here and wait. I'm gonna go out there. No. No, you're not. Listen, it's really simple. I mean, I'll go out there, and I'll create a diversion, and you just run, and don't stop. No! What else are we gonna do? Were you looking at condos for you or for us? It's not the time. Just answer the question. It was for us. Hey! Where are you going? This is what he came for. No. You can't do that. Why? I just want to forget this happened, okay? Okay. Help me move this. Look. I don't know who you are, and I don't care. Please, just... take this and leave us alone.
