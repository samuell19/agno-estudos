I'd like to know if great love really exists, or if it's all just a stupid game of roulette. An incredible coincidence If you get hit by a particular sunray. I'm actually in a pretty good situation. All those men at work... You usually only find that many among steelworkers. Hopefully not all married. "At work" sounds as if I was already an old hand. And yet I only got the job by chance, a bit like making a dent in a car. THE POLICEWOMAN You worked for the post office? - Yes, for five years. First, I was in delivery, later I was a cashier... behind the counter. Then they merged two post offices, and some of the staff was dismissed. Station 2, Chief Officer Krause. Yes? I'll need 30 minutes. Okay, 15 minutes. You were talking about the post office. Yes, when they packed up... I mean when they closed down... Yes... no! I'm on my way. I'm sorry. Last night, two boys stole a car. They were spotted and chased by one of our patrol cars. They crashed into a bus at full speed. Completely mangled. Curtains for them. - Dead? Yep. 15 and 16 years old. - Jesus. I got a press conference. And it's all our fault again. I tell this to everyone who starts here. In theory, everything looks different than in practice. You have to get tough. Why did you join the police? - I like working with people. It's respectable work. - I see. You know you're the only woman on the shift? - Sure. No problem. Could I have your attention for a moment, please? Could we turn the TV down a bit? This is our new colleague, Annegret Küster. 27 years old... I'm allowed to say that, aren't I? She's fresh out of college, and this is her first police job. I'd like to ask you to show her how things work here. Mike, you're best at that. - Sure... the way things work. You're lying! Tell them you're lying! - Stop it! It was an accident! An accident, you pig! That's enough now. - I picked her up from the bar, and she bumped her head against the side of the bed! Take him away! He hit me! She's gotta go to the hospital! - Damn it! Be quiet! You're not normal anymore! - He beats my children! It's disturbance of the peace! The neighbors have complained. Are you okay? - Yep. It was that Schmitt woman. - Be quiet! - That old cunt! Ms. Kubitchek, pull yourself together! What's your name? - Benny. Is this your home? - Yep. Why don't you show me your bedroom? My God! Your sister? - No, a boy. Do you know what happened? Gerd picked up Mom at the bar, then they had an argument, and Mom fell against the side of the bed. Does your mom drink lots of beer? - Beer and schnapps and pills, too. Where are they? Over there. Could you show me? She takes them for her illness. What kind of illness? - I don't know what it's called. Does your mom often have pains? Yes, in her soul. In her soul? Do you know what the soul is? - Yep. It's kind of inside you. What does it look like? You can't see it. Is it good or bad? I think it's good. Sure, it is. Where's the dent? C'mon, where's the dent? Here! I can see it a mile off! The big dent. - Where? It's all scratched here. - That little bit! Okay. Then come with me. You, too, please. Get a move on. We got other things to do today. Now enter the green van. Quiet down now. Quiet down. Fill out the forms: Name, address, vehicle owner. Don't the police do that? - We check it afterwards to see if you've done it properly. Isn't that nice? This is what we mainly deal with: Nonsense! And disturbance of the peace, of course. - Nothing else? Accidents, break-ins, shoplifting at department stores, father, mother, rolling-pin, skinheads, neglected juveniles. - What should I write next to "damage?" That you got a screw loose! Damage... door... bottom right. Okay? - Thanks. - You're welcome. There's a lot going on here. You can say that again. The people who got money move away. The people without stay here. I'm finished. - Just a moment, young lady. We gotta check it over first. I bet you want to have your license back again, don't you? Where d'you actually come from? - Brandenburg. Brandenburg in Saxony? - No, Brandenburg in Brandenburg. For me, everything south of Rostock is Saxony. It's okay. - The signature's missing. The signature's missing. And you get a fine. What? - Section 8, paragraph 1. Not yielding the right of way. I actually wanted to stay in Berlin, but they didn't need anybody there. It's not so bad here either, is it? - It's okay. You got the Baltic Sea. - Hey, Lio. Did they get you again? Yes, no good. Too expensive. - Have to let the "glass glow" over it. Some idiots keep smashing his windows. Got a standing order at the glazier's. - No good. - Nope, no good. Another Diet Coke, please. - Yep. D'you often go to the Baltic? - What for? Too crowded in the summer and too cold in the winter. Here you are. - Thanks. - Oh! Kids love the sea. - Really? My little nephew always says, "Anne, when you're a policewoman there, we'll go to the Baltic every day. If I had a child... It isn't a bad place for kids, is it? Well... Wanna shower? Go ahead, if you really want to. There's only a shower for men. The stall in the back on the right is free. Nobody else showers here. I'm almost finished. Albert said that nobody showers here. - What? Albert said that nobody showers here. - Nobody showers? - Yeah. Albert said so. - I normally only shower at home instead of in this crappy tiled palace. Where? Tiled palace. I had a burst pipe at home. See you tomorrow. - Bye. Stay where you are, Ms. Seemann! Always the same. We bring her back to the nursing home, and she runs away. Doesn't even know her name. A screwball. She can't hear you. - Like I said, a screwball. Stay where you are, Ms. Seemann! Where were you heading today? What's that? - For you. For me? What for? No reason. Give it to your kids, if you have any. I know how long it's been going on. - We wanted to keep a record, just for fun. For last month. All the taxi bills. Katrin, could you answer the phone? I'll talk to the authorities. - We've heard that story before. That was very dangerous today. - For my colleague, as well. Of course. Katrin, the phone! There's a speed limit! - Not here. Katrin! - Keep a closer eye on her. We try hard, but we have 420 residents. There are only six of us, and we have to patrol half the town. Ms. Seemann, why do you keep doing this to us? - She probably wants something to eat. You know how much we worry about you. Go to the dining room. There's coffee and cake. Can't somebody answer the phone? Watch out! In the nuthouse, they only got cat food. Take care. Shouldn't I come along? - No way. You stay here. Keep in contact with headquarters. - If you see anyone, sound the alarm. Yeah, sure thing! Robbie 7012? - 7012 here. Where are you? - Nexö St. The break-in. I'm watching the place. He's long gone. Drive to Brandström... - Wait a moment. Somebody threw a dog out of the window. You take over, okay? Put your hands up! Your hands! Stay down! I said, stay down! Jegor Kovaltchenko... No previous convictions? Nothing? Legs apart! Immigration office? Entry visa? Look at that! - Stand up properly. Wonderful. Thanks. He's a German citizen. - Aren't we lucky! Okay, Tovarish. Gonna speak German, or do we have to get an interpreter? You speak German? Guess I didn't forget it. - But it won't help. Let's go. He's yours. - Okay. C'mon, move it! Get in there. That's it. If there's a problem, here's a bell. A bell! If there's a problem. Is everything okay? A great talker. Shouldn't we give him a blanket? - And breakfast in bed tomorrow! We aren't running a hotel here. Boy, am I hungry! Let's go get a kebab. - The old lady was kind of boozed, and she threw her daughter's dog out of the window. The animal's okay now, so what would you write down? Something about "animal protection?" - Anyone want a kebab? No, more like "cruelty to animals. " - The dog's okay now. Write: The dog flew out the window. Period! A kebab with or without sauce? - With lots of garlic. - Lots of garlic. Dog flew out the window. - Damn it. Where's my wallet? I took it when I got out of the car. Otherwise someone might have stolen it. That was nice of you. Thank you. You eat and eat. I get fat just looking at a roll. Turn around. - No. C'mon! - No, this is stupid. Stop it. You aren't fat. Your clothes just make you look fat. Right, Lio? You stuff yourself. You don't eat. She isn't fat, is she, Theo? - I'm staying outta this. A woman's gotta have something to show in the right places, of course. Right, Lio? She shouldn't be a bag of bones that gives you bruises. I see. - You women are all nuts. My old lady goes on one diet after the other. Yeah... - First "compatible eating. " Then a potato diet. But the wildest thing was a champagne diet. She was drunk all day. Wait a sec, Benny! Stop! Hold on! Can't you hear me? I was at your place. Remember? What's under yourjacket? - Nothing. I saw you steal something. C'mon, show me. What have we got here? Don't ever let me catch you again! Did you fall into a paintbox? - Nonsense. Where's Mike? His kids are sick. - I see. Do you miss him? - Nonsense. You should have seen those two. Came here after a minor car accident. They really bad mouthed each other, so I had them breathalyzed. 1.4 and 1.7 parts per thousand. Stupidty must be punished. Where to? - The savings bank. Step on it. Come out of there, please. You can't sleep there. Wake up, please! Come outside, please. That isn't permitted. I'm counting to ten, and then the police'll be here. Get a move on it, or I'll make you move! You see, it works. You're putting on a wonderful show, but get outta there! I've had it! Got a card? - Just a sec. Hey, buddy. I don't believe it. You can't pee forever. Open up. Open up. "When I grow up, just listen, please. I'm gonna join the old People's Police. " You dirty pig! I'll rub your nose in your own filth! - Albert! I'll rub your nose in it! - That's enough! Get outta here! And don't ever come back here again! - He's bleeding! Get outta here! - Albert! Shouldn't we have taken him to the hospital? - Nonsense! Watch out! You don't have to hold back because of me. Well, it's just that I... You didn't exactly hold back on that Russian recently. He'd have run me down. - Exactly. It's just what those guys deserve. That's all they understand. Talk to them? Bullshit! They do it again behind your back. Laws! You arrest those guys today, and the D.A. Lets them out tomorrow. And you arrest them again the day after. So you gotta be tough and club them on the head, like you did. It works half of the time, but now you think you must... She ripped off my wallet! It's okay now... Everything's okay now. Shut up! - Stay out of this! - Against the wall! Everything's okay. - She ripped off my wallet! Everything's okay now. Come here. I don't believe it! - Yeah, yeah. That whore can steal whatever she likes! - Quiet, or I'll take you into custody. She ripped me off, man? - Did you understand me? Okay. - Are you relaxed now? Yeah. - Everything okay? Okay. Don't do anything stupid. I don't believe it. She rips off my wallet, and I get in trouble. Sit down and we'll look into it. Okay? Sit down. Morning. Did you sleep okay? Hey, cool it! You gotta search somebody. Theft during intercourse. Her client claims she stole his wallet. Is this your bag? Mine? No. It belongs to that cunt. Okay... take it. Okay, I'll take care of it. Okay, do it. You can't be serious. We can be very normal to each other, can't we? C'mon. Put down your bag. A real pile of shit, huh? Let's put down the bag. Let's put it down for a sec. You'll get it right back. I have to search you. You know that. C'mon. Take off your jacket, please. C'mon, I'll help you. Help me a bit. We have to take off your shirt. C'mon. Take it off. Fast. Take off your pants. It's almost over. We're nearly finished. Sit down over here. Didn't find anything. - Didn't find anything? I don't believe it! She ripped off my wallet! No, that's mine... - She stole my wallet! There it is! There it is! There it is! - Okay! This is your wallet, huh? - Of course! Sure, of course. How much money did you have in it? 150 marks minus the ten she always gets. 150. - Sorry, I must have overlooked it. Allegedly it wasn't there. - And now it is. Ain't that nice? What a miracle! - Want me to write down particulars? Goodbye, and I mean pronto. Have a nice day. Thanks. You have to grow a thicker skin. Come here. I can speak German, okay? I'm a German citizen. All the better. What do you want from me? Are you afraid? I asked you first. Why are you following me? I'm not following you? You followed me. - What? What were you doing at the disco? - None of your business. You were spying on me. You were watching me all evening. Bullshit. - That's no bullshit. Tell your cops I'm not into drugs. No Russian mafia! Got it? Here he is. Two packages of coffee. Why coffee? - His parents probably sent him. They're notorious here. You know that's shoplifting? - I'd like to tell them off. Got the receipt? - I do. I bet he's from the children's home. They always run away, and they burn stuff downstairs. You gotta do something. - See you tomorrow, Kurt. The playground is covered with butts. If you're gonna steal something, just don't let yourself get caught. Hello, Lütten-Klein Police Station, Officer Küster speaking. Your son Benny was caught shoplifting. Could you come and pick him up? Thank you. Goodbye. It was just the answering machine. Where do your parents work? - Nowhere. I see. Know where I could find them now? Okay... Kubitchek, Benny. 4 Paul Robeson Street. Age? Ten. Why aren't you at school? Hey! I'm talking to you! Or d'you want me to phone the school? Had a free lesson. The math teacher was sick. What were you doing at the store? Getting coffee. Why didn't you pay? Did you lose the money? Mike, Anne, time to go! - Now of all times! I'll have my colleagues look after you. Your mom will be here soon. Doesn't really look like a murderer. If all murderers looked like murderers, we'd have less work. How many have you seen? I've forgotten. Seven or eight maybe. The last one was a young guy who killed his dad with an axe. And why? - No idea. What did you talk to him about? His job, the weather, music... Not about the murder at all? - Nope. I feel kind of weird about it. Take it easy. He isn't waking up yet. Okay, no problem. Anyway, he won't try to kill himself right away again. At least, not by slitting his wrists. Got any plans for this evening? - Me? Nope... You? Movies, maybe. Haven't been to the movies for ages. There's a new movie with Schwarzenegger. - Really? - Yeah. What's the guy's name? - Arnold Schwarzenegger. Asshole! This guy. - Wagner. Where's... where's Lore? Mr. Wagner, d'you want something to drink? Where's Lore? Maybe you're hungry. Is she dead? Did I... kill her? I can't tell you anything now. Oh God! Oh God! How? How did I do it? I think you strangled her, but she's still being examined. It isn't definite yet. I don't want to live anymore. I want to be dead, too. No... - Calm down, Mr. Wagner. I want to be dead! - Mr. Wagner! When I'm... When I'm... When I get better again, I'm gonna jump outta the window. What should I do? What should I tell my kids? I'm now a... murderer. Maybe I'll go to the movies with you. - Really? A bit of change won't hurt. Yeah, if you feel like it. See you shortly. - Okay. We'll meet at the movie theater? - Yep! What're you still doing here? Everybody's out. When and where did you hear the shots? I gotta go. My shift's already over. - Mine is, too. At least, I hope your parents are home. My dad lives up there. Your dad? - Up at the top. How come? - Gerd isn't my real father. My real father doesn't want to see me. We'll just say that you lost the money, okay? Or somebody took it off you. "Lost" is better. Maybe you needed it for something? For the class trip. It costs 250 marks. Your mom can't pay the money, huh? She wants to write an excuse and say I'm sick. Good evening, Ms. Kubitchek. - Evening. Why didn't you come down to the station? - Come in. I spoke on your answering machine and asked you to pick him up. - Yeah? Didn't hear it. It's already 8:30. - Sometimes he sleeps at a friend's. Could I come in, please? He was supposed to buy some coffee, but then he lost the money. - I see. We still have to press charges. - Of course. Bye bye. Good evening. Sorry if I woke you up, but your light was on... What d'you want? What's the matter now? I don't want to arrest you or anything. No Russian mafia. I have nothing to do with that. I'm off duty now. Okay, I'm listening. It's about Benny, Benny Kubitchek. - Did she report me again? Who? - His mother. Benny just told me that... - Then no police. It's about the child, not about you. Otto! Lütten-Klein Police Station, hello. Gray hair, about 70, slightly confused. Yes, that's Ms. Seemann. Bus station. Okay, we'll pick her up. Yes. Just what I like. Won't go to the movies but snoops around in the computer. Do we have permission? - Just checking something. Jegor Kovaltchenko, sailor. Ahoy, ahoy! He isn't paying alimony either. - He's Benny Kubitchek's real father. So what? - It'd do the boy some good if his father looked after him a bit. You think he can teach him something? How to break into stores at night? What a piss hole! All this fucking water! How much farther? Three storeys. - Three? Up at the top? - But we're halfway there, almost. If I'd known that, I'd have thrown it away. - Hello. Can't talk now. - How many storeys to the top? Don't know. Didn't count. Quite a lot, I think. Fuck it! I've had enough. We're almost there. - Please, I can't carry it up there alone with him. I can take one end. - Are you joking? Key's in my pant's pocket, on the left. Hurry up, girl. You can jerk him off later. Get in there. Thanks. - That was it. Don't ever call me again, okay? Are you a collector or something? Yeah, I sell to my countrymen. Then they sell them in Russia. I'm here because of Benny. The boy needs you. We recently caught him shoplifting at the department store. Oh shit! He showed me where you live and said that his father didn't want to see him. Now you want to throw me out again, don't you? You can't just come here and bring children into the world and not take care of them. I didn't want it this way. I wanted to keep my family, but his mother... I'm only here 'cause of Benny. Why have you stopped paying alimony? - I can hardly pay the rent. That's why she won't allow me to see him. But it's my business, and nobody else's! Is it still available? I still don't have a washing machine. Couldn't you have thought of that sooner? He should've taken an interest in him when we were married, but all he cared about was the store. - Electrical appliances? No, video rental. But he wasn't the only one with that stupid idea. Went bust? - Yep. What are you making there? - A chocolate layer cake. Has to stand. It's Benny's birthday on Saturday. - I see. My nephew always had chocolate layer cake, too. Are you having a big party? - No. Benny doesn't have that many friends. I could maybe stop by. It might make him happy. Ms. Kubitchek, can Benny see his father on Saturday? His father is here. I mean his real father. I have no idea what he told you, and I don't care. Oh God! I must've been a jerk to marry him. I was pregnant. Benny was born just after the Wall came down. We were fired immediately. I was a sales assistant, and he worked at a harbor warehouse. Instead of looking after his family, he was obsessed with that video shop. And now I have his debts. I don't want Benny to be in touch with him. I want peace and quiet. Hi, Benny. - Hi. Mom, Ms. Hagel wanted to talk to you again. Later, Benny. We're talking. Did the little guy drink it all? Ms. Hagel's his teacher. 250 marks for a class trip! They're nuts. Maybe the youth welfare office can help. - I'd never ask them. They got it in for me. 250 marks! That's something his father should look after. - He would if he had any money. Had, would, could. Benny has a father. He doesn't need a second one. COPS = SS = PIGS That's us... the pigs. Hey! I'm not a pig. Okay, I'll take it on myself. I'm the pig. They mean me, not you. You're a real character. Open up! Open up! Hey, you know how a policeman opens a can of sardines? Open up! Police! Open up! Shit! I may be stupid, but I'm not that stupid, guys. Get your ass in gear! I can't see the keyhole. - There it is! Snap it up! I got other things to do today. - It's pitch dark here. Oh, it's you, boss. - "Oh, it's you, boss!" I didn't recognize your voice. Otherwise I'd have turned it down. Turn it down, no matter who's out there! D'you understand? Were we too loud, boss? - Like a herd of wild monkeys! Quiet down! Fucking hell! What's wrong, boss? Trouble with your old lady? Okay, guys. I got a suggestion. You all go home home real fast. Got the picture? - Just 'cause of a little music? You're not usually so fussy. - We'll be real quiet. Don't touch me! Look, he's got such a pretty girl with him. Shouldn't be in such a bad mood. - Pull yourself together. I'd be in a really good mood if I were out with such a nice colleague. That's enough! Where's the booze? - None here. - Where is it? Alright, come here. What do we have here? Wow, was it somebody's birthday? Where'd you steal it? I didn't. - No? A bottle for 23 marks 99. Since when do you buy at "Edeka?" My brother-in-law gave it to me as an anniversary present. Listen here. You guys be quiet now, alright? - Yep! Or do we have to come back? - Nope! Call it a day. Okay, guys. If I come back, you're in serious trouble. Got it? - Yep! And the bottle'll be gone! - We'll have emptied it! Can't you hang it any higher? Didn't we say four? - No, three. - Really? How embarrassing. I thought we said four. Gotta get dressed first. I just got up. Got nothing on underneath. Don't look at the place. Everything's... I just... I'll make us some coffee, then I'll get dressed, okay? I'm in a no-parking zone. We have to put it in the kitchen. Could you close the door, please? Oh shit! Ouch!... I'm sorry. I can make us some coffee. - Okay. - Okay. Damn it! Coffee's ready. Just a second. I have champagne, too. The hose is already so old. And fresh fish, if you're hungry. You gotta be careful when you use the machine for the first time. Do you know how to cook it? I've never cooked fish before. Don't drink! Wait! Or sauerkraut! I'm coming! Don't chew too much. Swallow big pieces. Swallow big pieces. Don't drink. Come to the bathroom. Put your finger down your throat. - No! Benny once swallowed a bone. What d'you call it? Fishbone. - He swallowed a fishbone. I held him upside down, you know? Held his feet, head down, whacked him on the bottom, and the fishbone popped out. His mother shouted at me. She said, "He isn't allowed to eat fish. He's only five. " I said, "I ate fish when I was only two, and I never choked. " She said, "Yes, because you're an Aquarius. " My sign of the zodiac. Thanks for the meal. I have to go now. - No. It's Benny's birthday. D'you wanna go there now? His birthday isn't until Saturday. Yes, but I have to get him a present. - Oh, Jegor... I'll call you. I'm off work tomorrow evening. - Then I'll call in the evening. They can't do that, those stupid jerks! Why didn't you drive me home? You know where I live. Had to pay 30 marks for the cell. - 'Cause you live 5 floors up. Could've dropped me at the front door. - You were bombed, petrified. This is my breakfast. Want a piece? - No thanks. I've already had mine. It'll soon be spring. It's about time. They turned off the heating. You know, I could have a better life. The other day, I met someone in the bar, an old friend. He said to me, "Moni, come to my place. I got a big house. I'll give you money. " But I don't love him. So I can't live with him, can I? You're right, Moni. I feel the same. Okay, I gotta go to work. - Me, too. See you, Moni. Stop by again, okay? Did she fill your head with her worldly wisdom? At least, she has some. No new messages. Hello, Jegor. How are you? Oh, I just got in. I might be going out. Yes, maybe we can go out... I see... No. No problem. Another time. You, too. Bye. Mike, come here. I have a dead body. I hope it's still fresh. Death due to suffocation. Must've been here for a few hours. He couldn't free himself after he ran out of oxygen. Sebastian Schmiedel, 31 years old. Unemployed. Get a black one. - Was it suicide? - An accident. He had a predilection. Got an erotic kick from a lack of oxygen. People usually do it with plastic bags. Women are much better at things like this. - No, I feel terrible today. I always start crying. - What a big help you are. Thanks, you're a real pal. I finished work an hour ago. - That goes for all of us. Like to know when we can take off for the overtime. Hello... Ms. Schmiedel. Officers Jansen and Küster... We have to... - Herbert! Herbert! Let's go inside, okay? Hello, I'm afraid we have some very sad news for you. Your son Sebastian had a fatal accident last night. We are very sorry. We have to ask you to identify him. Here's the address. We're very sorry. Perhaps we'd better leave you alone now. How did it happen? He had an accident. He suffocated. In the little forest. - We're very sorry. Oh God! - Don't fall down. Shut the door. - I'll bring you... - Breathe deeply! Breathe deeply. Are you all right, Ms. Schmiedel? Should I call a doctor? - Suicide? Was it suicide? - No. It... it was an accident. What kind of accident? Yes, well... He was wearing his wet suit, and when the oxygen ran out, he didn't manage to get out in time. Why was he wearing his wet suit? - Maybe he wanted to go scuba diving. He was a passionate scuba diver. - I know. But they found him in the woods? Yes... you see... Oh shit, I shouldn't have told 'em that. They'd have found out anyway. - But not where he had his hands when he died. You didn't have to tell them that. - You do it next time. Okay, okay. I should've said he died while scuba diving. In the forest? - Or while practicing scuba diving. C'mon, stop it. - Yeah, yeah. If I was still being supported by my parents at 31, I'd probably put a plastic bag over my head, too. But you aren't. You're doing fine. You got a job and someone waiting for you at home. What about me? You're right. You always want what you can't get, huh? And what you can have, you don't want. What a pile of shit. Come on. C'mon. Wait... my cap. Good? You know, from the start, I always thought you were great. Honest. I never thought you felt the same. I'm not normally one for ladies. Mike? - Huh? What's your wife gonna say? I'll tell her about a double shift that went on till morning. Till morning? - She doesn't understand that stuff. Can I cuddle up to you and sleep a bit? I'll slip away very quietly, okay? I wouldn't believe it. Well, you aren't my wife, are you? Thank God. Listen, we aren't a taxi service, we're the police. We don't have time to take crazy old ladies back to old folks' homes. No, you should get a doctor to send her to a mental hospital. Then ask your boss. Early shift today? What's up? Got a problem? I don't want to drive with Mike. Listen, I'll call back... Right. How come? I can't tell you why. How should I explain it to him? Don't. He'll understand. I just want to drive with someone else. Happy birthday. - A visitor for Benny. Hi. - Hello. Want something to drink? I've got Fanta, cocoa, water, or a touch of wine? No, thanks. It's just a quick visit. Okay, kids. Who wants some more cake? You aren't full yet, are you? - Sure! Come on. Eat it up. Are you full already? Eat it up. That's what Benny wanted. So leave it. - When's Benny coming? Should I get him? - No, thanks. He'll be right here. He's in his room doing something. Gerd, the baby's crying! - I'm on my way. We'll do the balloon dance now. Everyone takes two balloons, and you tie them around your ankles. Let them finish eating, Sonja. - Why? They've finished eating. C'mon, Frankie. When's Benny coming? - Soon. He's in his room doing something. Come with me, please. - Here you are. Tie them around your ankles, and step on them. The one who still has... Benny's gone. - What? Since when? He wanted to go to the playground, but he isn't there now. - In this weather? Did he want to meet somebody? - And step on them! Not yet, Frankie! You're a real hooligan! Hey, what's the matter? It's okay. Have you seen him or talked to him in the last few days? Sit down. - I'm in a hurry. Didn't you give him a call? Today's his birthday. You didn't plan to meet him? - No, damn it! I don't get it. Running away on his birthday. Something must've happened. Yeah, maybe his mother was drunk again. - No, I've just been there. I just wonder what on earth is wrong. Or did he use to do that, too? Did he use to run away? What's the matter? - It's a mess! My whole life's a mess! I told you, I don't know a thing. His mother won't allow me to talk to him, so how should I know? How should I know? I know nothing about my son! Don't worry. We'll find him. If you think of anything, call me. You've got my number. I'm sorry. I didn't know how to tell you. So you figured you'd go to Harald and tell him the whole story. I only said I didn't want to drive with you. And what did he think? That I steal too many of your chocolate bars? Or what? - You should've talked to him about it. Robbie 7012. - All the others know about it now, too. Albert won't keep his mouth shut. - Is that all you can think about? Yeah, sure! I got a family! How nice of you to think of them. Don't give me that! You're the one who dragged me home! Yes, I'm sorry. - I don't get it. You fooled around with me yesterday, and today... Don't you know what you want? - Yes, I do. I know now. What's going on? 7012? - Yeah, what's up? 7012? - Yeah, man! - Missing person: Benny Kubitchek was seen an hour ago. The little forest after the Warnemünde exit. Near "Seeblick. " You know where. Where are you? When you're done sulking, there was a gas station hold-up. Two guys, an old gray Merc. They can't have gone far. Where we always get our hot dogs? - Right. 7011, we're almost there. Where is he? - Went left heading for the freeway. I bet he won't make it. What about the boy? - The rain'll force him home sometime. No trace of him at all? - Now watch out. He may be hiding here. An old gray Merc, okay? - Sure. There he is! Turn on the siren! A dead end! We're gonna get him now. Stop! Freeze! Well? Lost track of him on the other side. - Damn it! Just what I thought. Where's your buddy? Where is he? What did you think? - Nothing. Keep an eye on him. I'll try to get that other guy. Asshole! Oh God. You robbed the gas station? How did that happen? Happen, happen! I needed money. Everyone wants money from me. Rent, debts, Benny... - What about Benny? We wanted to meet at the playground at noon. - So you did! He wanted 250 marks for his birthday, for the trip. I promised him. You couldn't rake up enough money? - I was ashamed. I didn't go there. Then you came and said he'd run away. - And you went and robbed a gas station? It was my buddy's idea. Real easy, real quick. Why didn't you tell me? I could've helped you. Yes, the police... your friend and helper. What's up? Where are you going? - Away. You can't do that! I set you free! Then say I hit you and ran away! No! Don't do that! You'll only make things worse! The keys! Jegor! Let me go! Jegor! Drive faster. Towards the freeway. - This is senseless... idiotic! You'll get probation for the hold-up. But this? - I know. I know you. I could've told them you're okay. I could help you, if you like. I'm turning around now. - No, keep going. Towards the freeway. Keep going! I'm not going any further. I want to go back with you. But I don't want to! Understand? I don't love you. Understand? I don't love any woman who always tries to do something for me! I don't need that. It makes me aggressive. Drive on! Towards the freeway! Drive on! Please, drive on. C'mon, get out! Get out! I figured we'd be fishing you outta the Baltic. Pulse okay? Did he? I just had to drive. Okay then. You'll get over the rest. My first one since five years. Thanks. Not now, I said. No. Hey, it's all right. It's over now. It could've turned out a whole lot worse. Be glad he didn't rape you. I understand you're upset. I'd be, too. But there's one thing I don't get. Why did you take off the handcuffs? I felt sorry for him. How come? He didn't look like a criminal. He'd robbed a gas station just ten minutes before. Explain that to the commission. There's bound to be a disciplinary hearing. You'll have to grow a thicker skin in the future, girl. Parents? No idea. They aren't at home anyway. The youth welfare office says he has to go to a home. Alright, I'll phone Sandkrug. Yes, okay. Just a sec. I got something for you. Here. A belated Happy Birthday. Well? What now? To your house? To a children's home? Where were you heading anyway? Away. Why? - Dad didn't come to the playground. Where is your class going? To Denmark. No, that's too far for me. Maybe you'd like to take a little trip with me to the sea. Could we? Sure, I'm the police. I once wanted to run away from home when I was still very young. I screwed my eyes shut, counted to 100 and wished very hard I could be in another place. Someone had told me that the wind carries you there. It didn't work though. Subtitles John R. Middleton Film und Video Untertitelung Gerhard Lehmann AG
