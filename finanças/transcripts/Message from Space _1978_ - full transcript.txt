The planet Jillucia is on the verge of death. Once the home of proud people, living in peace, it has been conqured by the Gavanas, the mighty invaders from space. Kido, ruler of Jillucia, with the warriors of his 60 tribes, fought valiantly. But they had been no match for the ruthless steel-skinned hoardes of the Gavanas. Creator of our universe... Forgive our sins... Grant us the miracle of salvation. Where these eight Liabe seeds land eight Liabe heroes will rise. The eight shall rise, and, with the help of the Creator, will save us from our doom. You glow, little seeds. I send you to your destiny. Emeralida. I hear, wise one. You will follow the Liabe seeds wherever they go. And when you return with the eight brave heroes... The people of Jillucia will be saved. Yes. Master! May I accompany your granddaughter because she may need help? Good. Go with my granddaughter. You protect her, if need be. I'm glad you're going. Emeralida may die while on this mission. You must be the one to carry it out. Understand, Urocco? Yes! Emeralida. You, my granddaughter. You must succeed in this, you and Urocco. Our people are counting on you. Wish me luck, wise one. Gavanas fortress. There's something wonderful... About a storm. Majesty! Well? Jillucians sighted in area 10. They're trying to escape. You're sure? Look, sire. I know they're going out in the universe to seek help. Just look! They ought to know it's hopeless to find anyone to defy me. Rockseia, you see them try to leave, and yet you do nothing. If they've gone to get help, anything can happen. I'd kill those Jillucians, and do it right now! You worry too much, mother. Son... Just a second ago, I saw up in the sky eight glowing Liabe seeds flying by. No! You're sure? Liabes are messengers. There's no telling what will happen. You'd better not let them get away. If you do, there's no telling what those seeds will do. I think you'd better get after those Jillucians and kill them. Urocco! Are you all right? Of course, I'm all right. Planet Milazeria These were the times when Earthling adventurers roamed the planets of the galaxy. Seeking riches in the form of resources and colonies. - Captain! Captain! - Yes, miss? What is that? Oh, that's a meteoric belt. The famous view of Milazeria. No, no, not that! I mean that cloud-like, shining thing. Hmm'? Oh! Those are space fireflies. - Fireflies?... - Mm-hmm. Oh, wow! I never knew fireflies could exist in space! Oh, god, they're gorgeous! Oh, it's just a name. Actually, they're flies emanating from space refuse. You see, miss, this meteoric belt, is a dumping ground for atomic ashes and industrial waste. Hey, Sean! What the hell happened? I'm sorry, miss. Roughriders are interfering with our course. What? Stupid idiots! What do they think will happen if we collide! Notify the Space Patrol and have them pick them up! Yes, sir. Hey! Lookin' good! Yahoo! Captain! Captain, let's follow them! No, miss! We can't do that! I'm sorry. Then, hurry up! Will you give me the wheel! I can't let you do that, miss! Your father would fire me! - You fool! - Please! Hurry up, or we're gonna miss them! Please, miss! Please, please, miss. Please, please, stop... Stop! Hey, Shiro, nice speed! Been a long time since we've been out cruising like this! Right, little wager? Yeah, if you wanna lose! Try to win! Just make sure you got the silver! Don't worry! Here we go! Uh-oh! It's the Space Patrol! Stop! You are ordered to stop! Please obey the code! Will you stop! Shut up, man! We live by our own code! Hey, let's settle this with a chicken run! Chicken? What's a chicken run? A chicken run, Banana. Let's go! Come on! You make a dive, go straight down. And then the first guy that pulls out is chicken! Stop! Yes. You wanna thread the needle? Okay! You got it! Whoo! Hey! All right! Oh, no! I beat ya, slow poke! And don't forget the silver! One lousy trial run, and look what happens! Huh? You stupid damn... What the hell is this? Hey, Aaron! Look what I found! Milazeria Command Center. Detail, halt! And salute! I think this is really ridiculous! What the hell's he doing? The commander must be out of his mind. If anyone reports him, he's in big trouble. Good-bye, Beba, my loyal friend. Rest in peace. General Garuda speaking. Emergency call, sir. Garuda, what was that object just launched? What's going on there? It was a rocket for a funeral. Funeral? Yes, I buried a brave soldier... In eternal orbit. What? Who was it? Soldier servant Beba-1... My robot. Your robot? You mean, you used a precious military rocket for a robot's funeral! That's right, general. Beba-1 served me faithfully for over 30 years. Military orders said he was outdated and had to be scrapped. You fool! You must be out of your mind! A man like you should be terminated immediately! Don't worry about that, general. I've already submitted my resignation, effective tomorrow! Good-bye, general. Beba-2, is everything ready? Yes, master. Beba-2 get good deal in space thrift shop. Ah, nothing fancy, nothing to look at. Just great. It'll be good to get out of my uniform. Hasn't felt right in years. You want something fancy, get French robot! Give me another drink. Yes, sir. Master, don't get smashed. Must find place to crash tonight. No more booze! No more booze! Hey, Beba, you better shut your voice box... Or I'm gonna cut out your valve. Come on, just gonna have one more drink, Beba. One more drink. Hey, what is this? You put something in my drink? No, sir. Of course not! Strange, doesn't taste like... Milazeria booze. Tastes like, um... It's like scotch. After too much, all booze tastes like scotch. You're beginning to talk like my ex-wife. Jackie! Jackie! Huh? Yeah? Yeah? You got the money from the bookies, didn't ya? Where's the cash? Uh, well, you know, I... I need dough, so go and get it! You see... Will you get it? I-- I loaned it! Look, you guys, I want that dough! I know he lent it to you! That dough belongs to me. I want that dough! He loaned it to ya, figurin' you'd do a little deal on the side. You gonna give me that money? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. You guys better have that money in half an hour! If you're one lousy minute late, you're all gonna end up in quicksand! I don't believe it! Get out of my way! You heard what he said! Get the money! Get the money! That's not what we agreed on. Now, you said we could take our time. That's why we're working here! I'll tell you what, give me what you got left. All right? We spent it! Every bit of it! You didn't? No, you didn't! We had to buy some parts for our machines! We had to buy some engines and parts and stuff! Big Sam's gonna throw us in quicksand! That's what he'll do! I know it! I know it! A nut inside a tomato? What's going on here? Aaron. It's just like ours. Huh? Hey, Aaron, Shiro! Maia! I've been looking all over for you. What are you doing here? Aw... I was goofin' with one of those military fighter planes... And the captain got so freaked out, he had an accident. So you're on the run? Sort of. My parents sent me here with a babysitter until things calmed down at home. Huh? Who is she? A girl roughrider, Jackie. Hey, yeah, uh, Meia, you got a rich old man, don't ya? Sort of. All right, uh... Why don't you help us out of this little financial fix we're in? What for? Because you're a great kid! We just had to borrow 30 pieces of gold. If we don't pay those gangsters back, they're gonna shove us down in quicksand. 30 gold pieces? All right. Wait, wait, wait! On one condition! You help me hunt for fireflies. Fireflies? From the shuttle ship, I saw these gorgeous space fireflies. I want them. You're out of your gourd! You can't go there! You'll get three years in jail! Just for going in the area! That chick is crazy! All right. No help... No gold! Shit! I guess it's better than being killed by Big Sam. Okay, Meia, anything you say. I tell you guys, this girl means trouble! There they are! Today's the day I'll get those two. Huh? Show off! This is Space Patrol, ordering you to land at coordinates 76, 73, 18. Oh, the dirty little bandits! Go ahead, shake it, will ya! If he catches us, we get three years in the cooler! Oh, don't worry! You don't think we're dumb enough to get caught by some stupid traffic cop, do you? They don't call me "Kamikaze" for nothin'! Oh! Come on, Jack! Let's go! Meia, I've had it. Okay, Jack, you just sit and wait for the space dragon to eat you up. Guess what? I feel better! Oh, god! These are no good! They turn into ashes as soon as you touch 'em. Well, you better catch them and keep them alive, if you're expecting any gold. All right! All right! Hey! Look over there! Oh, my god! What's that thing? It's getting too close. - Hey, Meia! We're goin'! - Come on, Meia! Let's go. What is that thing? Wonder if anyone's on board? It's like a haunted ship. - Come on, let's go! - Wait! Don't go in there! Jack! Would you cut it out, or you're going back to the ship! Come on! What's the matter? Do you know who they are? Are they dead? I don't know. Oh! Aren't they beautiful! I wonder what happened. They were probably attacked by space pirates. I don't like this. I don't like this at all. Hey! This engine wasn't made in our solar system. - Are you sure? - Yeah. There's nothing I don't know about engines. And these nets... generate some kind of magnetic energy. What are you sayin'? You mean they come from some other planet in the Milky Way? Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised. What's that ship? - Look at the size of it! - Never seen it before. Oh, my god! Look, they're alive! Who are you? Run, everybody! Let's get them out of here! Hurry up! Come on. Hurry! Hurry! Keep going! Keep going! The sky's crawling with fuzz! The goddamn patrol ship was just blown up! - Maybe we should tell the police. - Yeah, sure! Do that, and the fuzz will know we were horsin' around in a prohibited area. And we're good for three years in the space clink! I feel so terrible... That we caused this trouble. Yeah, sweetie. Trouble is right. We almost got killed because of you. - You understand that? - Jack! Jack!Jack! Get off my back! Hey! Hey, what's all this noise? Shh! The humanoids who own this place have come back. Having argument. I'm not gonna take this lying down. You understand? Huh? I expect to see a little "thank you" note. "Thank you" note? You heard what I said. I want some money! Jack, will you cut it out? You're just impossible! You leave me alone, will ya? That will be enough! I forbid you to go on. What? No dumb broad's gonna... Shh. Nobody does that to me! I got you! I got... You let those men go! You little... You little coward! Look, Urocco! You mustn't hurt those who are going to save us. Huh? Please, take this... Because you're bleeding. Here. By thunder! The Liabe gods would have chosen heroes... Not wastrels like these idiots. I should slit your throats, that's what I should do. No, Urocco! You must believe in the glorious seeds. These people are the ones who were chosen. Who are you? Sorry to break in on you like this, but I must have had too much to drink, wandered in here... ...passed out. I'm sorry. Look, I don't know if this means anything, but I overheard you talking about some strange seeds you have. I don't understand what this means. Maybe you can tell me about it. All right, I will. Our planet was invaded. Our planet was so happy. Until the Gavanas army came. That was the end of everything. Men, women, and children... The old... They were fighting and dying. They held out till the bitter end... As they died. They were heroes. Not a single one went over to the enemy camp. Crushed by the Gavanas, we made a last request... To the Jillucian god of Liabe. And he answered us. This is what he said, "eight will find the holy Liabe seeds. "And those eight will save us." Now you know everything. Our planet's future depends on you. I know it's a great sacrifice. What I don't understand, is why your god and these miracle Liabe seeds picked them. You see, I've been a soldier my whole life. And these young men, they don't seem to me as if they could even handle a weapon. That's right, we can't. Who needs 'em, anyway? Besides, we were all born after the last space war. Isn't that so? Yeah... no wars for me. Hey, tough guy! What about you? What do you have to say? Oh, well, uh... I think that, uh... There's only eight of us. What you really need is the Earth forces. What do you say? Look, what you need in your war are soldiers. And you heard them, they just told you they have no intention of fighting. And as for me... I couldn't do it alone. Couldn't win. You better take this seed back. Beba... let's go. What's wrong with you? Look, Beba-1 has now become a star, sailing through the sky. It's over now. Forget it. Beba-2 cannot forget. Repeat. Cannot. No robot can forget your goodness to robotkind. Hey, Beba, don't get emotional on me. Come on, will ya? But, master? Why not help these good people? Beba-1 would so wish it. You are strong man, fighting man, man of army. Look Beb', I'm not in the army anymore. There's no place in it for me. So, how can I help? You stop pushing it, you hear me? Just stop pushin' it! Come on, let's find a place to sleep. And watch where you're walking. You're gonna fall down, you're gonna dent yourself. Emeralida, we must go. We dare not waste a minute. We have to go out and... And search for the real heroes that are destined to save us. That is the will of your grandfather! All right. All right, Urocco. No! Wait! Are you all a bunch of cowards? - Aren't you gonna help them out? - Shut up! We're discussing what to do about them! So, uh... okay, huh? It's too much. Hey, you two! If we don't get money and get it soon, you know what Big Sam said he'd do! All right? No! Jack! I like you, and I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. I'll take you where the other four braves are waitin'. Really? You know who has the other Liabe nuts? - And you will take us there? - That's right. You know, these guys, they're not rough riders, they're wolf-hunters. Just the ticket for killing the Gavanas. Jack, I'm proud of you! They stayed overnight. They bought a lot of Brandy from me. Oh, my pretty one. This looks like the ones they had. You're certain? Yes, these nuts were so strange, I looked at them carefully. I offered to buy all four of them, but those men were too smart to sell them to me. There can be no mistake. If she's right... - Looks like we're in luck. - Yes, let's hurry. You cannot go, my pretty. It is far too dangerous. Only strong men can follow the mountain trails. And then there's the wolves who roam about very hungry at this time of year. Oh, yes, my pretty one. The mountains are no place for you. You know where the hell they are? Yes, all you have to do is follow the cry of the wolves. They're near the wolves. You'll take us there, lady? - Right now? - Yeah, right now. Oh, it's dark. - Why not go tomorrow? - Oh... So, it's dark-- it's dark. I just heard a Milazerian wolf howling. And tonight, if those wolves cut out, the hunters will, too. And these cats are in a hurry, you understand that? Please help us. My child, you would never be able to make it. Who knows what would happen to a lovely young girl out there? She's right. Wait for me here. I better go alone, Emeralida. Hope you make it, fella. Hikiroku... Get up and get ready. I want you... To show this young lady's two friends where those hunters are. Thank you, sir. I'm very grateful. It's nothing-nothing, my pretty. We must help one another, in this world. It's cold up there in those mountains. Here, have a good drink first. That's very kind. I appreciate it. Urocco... - You take care. - Yes. There's nothing to worry about, my dear. He's the greatest guide in our area. You betrayed us! So it was a trick! Sure, it was, stupid! The old hag put a Mickey in your drink! Hey! He was a tough cookie. Okay, a deal's a deal, let's see the dough. Ah! Here you are! Good! Good! That didn't take too long. Sit by the fire. - You must be cold. - Urocco! Where's Urocco? My dear, your friend Urocco isn't coming back. Well, we might as well begin at the beginning. He must be thirsty, so get him a nice drink. - Did you hear what I said? - Why are you doing this? I have payed a small fortune. I paid it for you, my pretty! So you could... Could be the bride of my son! Huh? You're just like the other people! They hate him... Because he's ugly! He was born on the planet Pluto. What are you waiting for? Make the pretty one yours. Good girl! I like to see a girl with a little spirit. Use this, my boy. I'm sure you know what to do with her. - She's alive. Take her! - Yes, sir. Soldier! - Take the old woman, too. - Yes, sir. Emeralida, come back! Please, don't take her away! No! Emeralida! Emeralida! Jack, how do you feel doing such a good deed? Real good! Was she glad to find four of the Liabe warriors? - Sure. - And? What happened to them? Where'd they go? They went off to go and fight, in a big spaceship. Then, what are you people doin' here? Leave me alone! Why not? You're supposed to be part of the Liabe brave! Yeah, I know. I know. No, you don't know! Or you wouldn't be here, you'd be out there with them. Out where? To Jillucia and Andromeda, two million light years away! How do you expect us to get there, anyway? Our machines wouldn't even last one light year. Then, make a ship! I'll give you the money to buy the parts! Oh, you can use the electronic frame from my machine, and we'll attach your ships to the wings of mine. When the battle begins, we can separate the ship into smaller machines, but then merge back together again! Oh, god, what a machine it could be! Hey, what a cool idea! I like it a lot! You idiot! What are you listening to her for? Hey, Aaron! What's bothering you? Dance! Come on! Come on! Urocco! I will never forgive you! Die! Jack, you're a real creep! Ah! I wasn't the only one. Those two got their share of the loot. What do you think they are? Little angels? Go on, ask them! You'll see. What? Is that true? Answer me, Aaron! Shiro, not you? Meia, think a little. You don't really believe in these silly nuts? A nut is a nut, honey. And that's all! You know, you've got to use your head. Because even if it's true, their problem is two million light years away. And there's nothing we can do to change that. You people are disgusting! All right, so I'm disgusting. I'm a punk. Who wants a war? You want to be a war hero? I don't! And what's it to you? You're just some rich man's spoiled daughter. You know where your daddy got all his bucks? From the last stinkin' war! Aaron... Sol don't give a damn what you say. I just like flying free, if it's all right with you! And I don't need anyone's advice to show me what I need! And who needs this? What are you doing? Shiro, get rid of yours, too. I hate you all! Oh! Mmm. Emeralida! Where are you? Emeralida! Emeralida! Have you seen where Emeralida is? Do you know where Emeralida is? What are you doing? What are you doing? Emeralida? Emeralida! Stop! She is about to die. Or would you rather die instead? No! I'm a human being from the planet Earth. And I don't care what you do with her! You lie! Because you are in love with her. No! I don't love anybody! Why would I sell her if I loved her? You do love her! And yet, you sent her into a trap. She will die, and you are to blame! No! Hey, what's the matter? What's the matter, little girl? Huh? What's wrong? No! We're all innocent! I didn't have anything to do with it! Don't kill me! Don't kill me! Cowards! Jillucia forever! What's the matter with you guys? Nothing. Nothing at all. Liabe nut. I wonder why it returned. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Look... the Liabe seed has come to me, too. - Yahoo! Woohoo! - Yeah! Yahoo! Aaron, what's the matter? You didn't get one? What's wrong with you? Relax, Aaron. We'll all get one. You'll see. Take it easy. Be a little patient. You'll get one. Hey, don't bother me! I'm not a kid! I didn't even want one. And stop making so much noise. I can't get to sleep. Master! The enemy ship is returning. It's about to land, master. Welcome to my base, Emeralida. I've wanted to talk to you for a long time. Rockseia, nothing you can say can change what happened. Since the Gavanas' invaded, our sacred land has been destroyed by your soldiers, its people killed. Death crawls in your wake. You're detested wherever you go. Our only hope lies in your defeat. It was not our fault if we had to destroy this planet. My only desire was to keep Jillucia beautiful, fertile, and rich. But you refused to surrender. You had no chance to win, yet you refused to surrender. That is what brought you your destruction. Surrender? We Jillucians do not surrender. Get this into your head, Jillucians are not your cattle! We would rather die. We would rather die in honor than to be slaves of someone. There is nothing you can make me do... That will... That will alter the way I feel. Jillucia will fight you, right to the end. Take her away. Sire! Rockseia, I trust you're going to kill that girl. No, one day she may be of use. May I speak, your majesty? Go on. We brought back something else, your majesty. A creature capable of thought. We found it in the solar system. I brought it back for study. Very good. There is life in the solar system. This proves it. On the thought screen, sire. We hope to get a look at the creature's memory. I'm tired... tired. I've been traveling from one planet to planet, all this time. I must return to... Yes, return to... To go home. To Earth. What's wrong? Something's wrong, captain. Sire. The woman is dying. If we continue, it may cost her her life. Hurry up- sire. Beautiful. Never before have I seen such a beautiful planet. What do you call it? Earth, it turns around the sun. It's the third planet. A beautiful planet. Sire, the creature's dead. Mother. Don't you think... That the planet Earth is the only suitable place for the grand palace of the conqueror of the universe? I do, my son. If you're able to manage that, Rockseia, you will be admired forever as the king of kings throughout the glorious history of the Gavanas people. Son, I'm still worried about the Liabe. Forget about them, mother. I have taken precautions. I am relieved to hear that. Now, you issue orders to go and conquer Earth. For as long as we are masters of a great fortress like this, then, surely, the victory is ours. No matter what the Earth men try to do. Master, look! The sky! It's leaving us! The sky is not leaving us. No, children, Jillucia has started to move. Soon, an unidentified planet moving from the Andromeda nebula toward the solar system was reported by the Earth's intergalactic space warning system. A space hieroglyphic message was received and decoded by Earth. In it, Rockseia xii of Gavanas, demanded that Earth become a tributary planet of his empire. As a reply, the Earth federation of nations sent three of its most lethal space carriers to seek and destroy the Gavanas. Launch fighter squadrons! Yes, sir! Standby, atomic missile! Fire! Fire! They want war? Then they shall have it. Launch the attack! Sire! The news of the defeat of the Earth space fleet shocked the council of the Earth federation of nations. The chairman of the council assumed responsibility... And resigned. A new congress was organized by the opposition with Ernest Noguchi as the chairman. - Here he comes. - Come on. Is he here? Yes, we finally found him. He's in the bar. I'm afraid he's had a lot to drink. General Garuda. My friend, how are you? Noguchh I should say "chairman Noguchi". Congratulations on your appointment. You've come a long way, my friend. You've come a long, long way. Ironic, isn't it? I ascend to power because of the Gavanas, at the very time they threaten Earth with destruction. Oh, you have my sympathies. But I don't care about the Earth. I don't care about its politics. I know all that. Earth is on the verge of annihilation. That must not happen. Garuda, I want you to go see Rockseia. The Earth's special envoy. - Special envoy? - Mm-hmm. What are you saying? They demand we surrender unconditionally. They have given us only three days to comply. Your mission is to give me more time. I see. What the Earth needs is more time to prepare for an attack. But why do you want me for this special mission? Why? Do you remember... What I, uh... ...what I called you when we were in school together? I remember. Don Quixote. Mm-hmm. Now you know why you're the one that was chosen. You're the only one in the world that will go out and take on a giant with only a Lance. No, Noguchi. It's impossible. Even if the Earth had more time, it's still gonna lose this war. And the generals... They've been discharged and disgraced by the committees and replaced by political appointments. We've had 20 years of peace, but today the Earth doesn't have a strong military defense. What's wrong with you? I-- cannot believe what I heard today. You do your duty as a soldier, you hear? I'm not in the military anymore! I've buried my career! In orbit! With Beba-1. I can't do it. It's the seed again. I've been chosen by the gods. Is there something wrong, Garuda? No, nothing's wrong, Naguchi. It's the sign, the sign I've been waiting for. Beba? Yes, general? Get my things ready. I'm going to the Gavanas. As the envoy. Hot dog, master! Meia? Why do you think Aaron didn't get one of those Liabe nuts? Well, if he keeps acting like that, he's certainly not going to get one. He's just pouting like a big baby. Urocco! What are you doing up? I cannot stay here. I must go and search... For the Liabe braves, and then defeat the Gavanas. You're not going anywhere. Get back inside. We're busy. Hey! He)!' I got news! You know the old drunk that day? The one with the little robot? Well, he's a general. Some big wheel came from Earth to send the general to Jillucia! Well, let's hurry up! We'd better get goin'. - Shiro! - Hey! What's the matter? Aaron! Aaron! Why don't you just change your mind? Give us a hand. Don't bother me. Why don't you change your mind? You think you look like a brave warrior or somethin'? Shouldn't be readin' fairy tales. Look, Aaron, we all know how you really feel. You're in love with... Emeralida. Huh? What are you talkin' about? I'm just not gettin' involved in this craziness like you guys, all right? And I'm just goin' to sleep. So just get off my back! Aw, come on, Aaron. I said, shut your mouth! No, you don't! - Shiro! - Shiro! - Aaron! Shiro! Stop it! - Come on, you two! Cut that out! Stop! No fighting! - Cut it out, I said! - Shiro! It's that ship again! Ah! Oh! No! Ah! Ah! Ah! Jack! Hey! Now where are you goin'? To get Jack! What am I supposed to do? Stand here and forget it? - You can't go alone. - Aaron, stop it! Are you crazy? Aaron! Get off my ship! Aaron, look! Look! You got it. Way to go, buddy. I knew you'd get one. It's a message. We've all been chosen, and we've gotta work together. Come on, Aaron. Get your ship ready, and let's take off. We'll be landing on Jillucia in 20 minutes. Let's get to our stations. - Yeah. - Okay. Aaron, Shiro, get ready for firing position. Rogen Rogen what's going on? Ah! I can't control the steering! Where do you think we are? I think this planet is part of the bernardi star system. Damn it! I still can't figure out why the lousy seeds interfered! I don't know. If we'd gone straight to Jillucia, we could've found Jack. What was that noise? Look there! It's the Gavanas! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Urocco! Who are you? Bandits? Speak! Before you die! Wait! He's a Liabe brave too! I am Prince Hans, heir to the Gavanas throne. The evil Rockseia was my undoing. He killed my father, the king of Gavanas. And he killed my mother as well. My friends, I will follow the will of this seed. I will join you four in your mission. But think a moment, do you realize you would be fighting your own people? They would be your enemy. The fate of the universe hangs in the success of the Liabe mission. I shall do what I know I must do. Wait a minute. Now I see. The Liabe seeds intended to break our instruments so we'd meet up with Hans. You're probably right. Yes. Now off to Jillucia! Earth. Why do I hunger for you so? Why are you the most exquisite sight my eyes have ever beheld? Why do you excite me? Why? Rockseia, the Earthlings have not replied yet. The three days are up tomorrow, and they have not replied. What are you going to do, huh? Don't worry about it, mother. They're panicking. In fear of our forces, they'll surrender tomorrow. Majesty- we have just sighted an Earth ship. They request an audience, your majesty. The Earthlings have come... At last. Tell the envoy I shall see him. Emperor Rockseia, grand empress, the Earth federation appreciates your granting me this audience upon short notice. You are welcome. But before we begin, I have a little gift for you. - The gift. - Sire! The gift! You wanna kill me! I know it! I know it! Go ahead! Go ahead! I'm not afraid to die! I'm a Liabe brave! General! Oh! Don't let them kill me! Please! I don't wanna die! I don't wanna die! What's so funny? You, what are you laughing at? I said, "what are you laughing at?" This man may be a fool, but he's a citizen of my planet. You make him beg for his life and then laugh at him. You are challenged! Wait. Just a moment, Genera Garuda. You are here as Earth's special envoy. Yet you have behaved in an insulting manner, Genera Garuda. No, I haven't, your highness. A citizen of Earth has been ridiculed before your entire court. According to our law, I have the right to challenge. If it is refused, then, this man and everything he stands for will be dishonored. All right, you can challenge. Lazarl, accept him. Sire! The z-guns are loaded with a single charge. You will start back-to-back, then, at the 10th step, you will turn around, and you will fire. Begin! No fair! Beba... I'm all right. Nine, ten! I was disgraced by this coward. Go and throw the body out. Sire! Emperor Rockseia... On Earth, we, too, have our cowards, and we have our fools, but, like the Gavanas, we have those... That value honor... More than life. So even if the government agrees to the surrender, the people will not, they'll fight your armies. They'll mobilize their forces, even knowing they can't win. And in the end, the Earth will be destroyed. Yes, that green planet will become a barren desert like Jillucia. And so, your highness, the Earth federation has sent me to ask you for time. Time so we can round up these radical forces and prepare our citizens for a peaceful surrender. That was well done. Earth needs time for its counterattack, eh? Very well done. You talked so well, you almost had me taken in, but not well enough. It's true, the Earth is too lovely to be destroyed, so... Let's consider its satellite. I'll destroy the moon. General, if Earth surrenders before the deadline tomorrow, it will be saved. If not, you see what will happen to it. Now go. I warn you, he's a Liabe seed chosen one. I wonder if it's very wise to let the general get away. Beba. Yes, master? We're going back to the Gavanas. Repeat, please. The Gavanas. We're going back. Understood. General Garuda, why are you in uniform? Tell Chairman Noguchi Don Quixote has returned. Don Quixote has returned, sir? I don't get it. Don't worry about it. He'll know what I mean. Once more, once more into the breach, my Sancho panza. You follow me. But whatever you do, don't land on top of me. Very funny. - Let's go. - Yes, master. If you're scared, do not come. Good-bye. I'm a Liabe man, too! There's no way we can get close without being seen. Do you have any ideas? Just let us handle it. We already have plans. Right? Right. Let's go! - Yeah! - Yay! This is Shiro. I'm ready. I'm ready too. Okay. Prepare for a chicken run operation. Flying object in second patrol area! What? Red alert! Ready for firing position? Ready to fire. Fire! Huh? Must have crashed. A meteorite is what it seems to be. Aaron, Shiro, converge now. Interlock complete. Interlock complete. Here it is, Urocco. Your home. Jillucians! Jillucians! This is Urocco. I come with four of the Liabe braves. Ah! Hey! Hey! - Jack! - Jack! Yeah! All right! Yeah! Yeah! General! So you decided to come. Yes. - Who is this man? - Oh, Prince Hans. He's also one of the Liabe brave. Welcome. Welcome. An honor. Well, it looks like the six of us have been chosen to go. Right, Beba? Two more to find, but no robots included in deal. Too bad. That's all right. You go with me. Observe. This is the only way to the Gavanas reactor furnaces. All energy for the planet fortress is generated here, but it is closely watched. The only way to defeat the Gavanas is to destroy their ability to generate power. No one has ever succeeded. If we blow up the furnaces, the towers will be destroyed. So will your planet. I know, but... But... we do not have a choice. Those reactors must be destroyed. Master... No. Urocco, listen to me. I know... It's hard to understand, but we have to destroy our planet. That's the only way we can also destroy the Gavanas. 'D0 you agree? You all agree, huh? Why must we destroy Jillucia? Why? What about your people? Our spaceship there, it is still able to navigate. The women and children can leave on it. With the will of the gods, they may make it. Well, the only trouble is to figure out a way to get through their defenses. This spiral tube leads right to their furnaces. It's only about 10 meters in diameter. There must be a way. It's impossible to destroy that reactor. We can't do it. Rockseia will be... Master of our universe. What did he say? Ten meters in diameter? Hmm. How about threading the needle? What did you have in mind? We'll dive right into the spiral thing with our ship. Now the Gavanas would never think anyone would be nuts enough to try and fly a spaceship right into their castle. It's risky, but it might work. That tunnel is only 10 meters side-to-side. One mistake, and you've had it. Hey, we've gone tunneling lots of times. It's a hobby. Yeah, tunneling's very common on Earth. We've done even narrower ones. And anyway, we got no other choice. Now, we can get inside. Maybe that's why they were chosen by the Liabe seeds. All right. I want you to study that plan, every detail, all the interior structures, and I want you to remember it. Oh! Liabe nut! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! What's the matter with you? Look, Beba-2 find Liabe nut. Beba-2 brave. Aw! Beba, that's great! - Beba, you've been chosen. - That's seven. This is seven. Who's the eighth? Drop your weapons! Your weapons! Put your weapons down. Put 'em down. Forward. Grandfather! Emeralida! Hear me, all of you. You know who I am. I know what you intended to do. General Garuda, Prince Hans, as well as these four young Earth men. We know that you people were chosen, were chosen by the Liabe holy seeds. I knew you would come. I know everything. Because one of you is a traitor. Poor old fool. This is a sad moment for you, huh? Now that those Liabe heroes of yours have been put in my custody, what can you do? All your dreams have been shattered, old one. I will tell you, this is the last time I will. Surrender, and I promise no harm will come to you. Rockseia, it's true that you brought Jillucia to its knees. Yet there is no ruler who can rob us of what we have in our hearts. I believe this, for as long as the Jillucians have faith, then, Jillucia shall rise again to its former glory, and you and your Gavanas shall be defeated! You dreamer. Kido, do you really believe all that? Ridiculous. Look at your Liabe miracle men. Then, you must die. You will be executed by your own traitor. Urocco. Urocco, have you gone crazy? Answer me. Don't look at me like that! Since this all began, we never had a chance, not a single chance, just hope for a miracle. And now, you would destroy our planet. What good is freedom, what good is the pride of our race if we lose our land? You listen to me, I'll kill you. I'll not let you do it. Lllnnn I "us: Urocco! Urocco, Liabe gods have chosen even robot like Beba-2. Do not kill. Do not betray. Urocco, what are you waiting for? I'm losing Patience. Kill him. A traitor is a traitor. Rockseia! Shiro! There! Over there! Okay! Beba, get back! Urocco! Urocco! Urocco! A Liabe seed. You're the eighth chosen one, Urocco. Oh. Oh. A message of the gods to tell you that now we cannot lose. Yes. Urocco! Old one! We'll keep your back. Get your people to the ship! I go! - Let's disperse. - Go ahead. Go on. - Let's go! - Give 'em cover. Let's hey, where are you going, you guys? Never fear. Beba-2 is here. Beba, you all right? Only hurt when laugh. Go ahead! Come on! Hey. Help, Shiro! Do something with this light! Right. Okay, let's go! Aaron, Shiro, ready for ejection? Rogen okay. Let's do it. Go! Here they come. Nice shot! Aaron, Shiro, good luck! To the ship! Forward! Hurry! Start the reactor! Come on! Into the boat! Come on, get in the boat! Beba, what are you doing? Come on, get-- Beba-2 okay. Yeah, sure. Come on! Hans. - Finally. - Traitor Rockseia... ...who killed my parents, who stole the throne of Gavanas, who caused massacres and bred fear throughout the universe... A dog that deserves to die. Die! Aaron! What's up ahead? That's the spiral! Hit it! Shiro! Watch out! Okay! We did it! Hurry! Prepare the ship! Women and children! Women and children! The planet! The planet's breaking up! Get to the ship! Get to the ship! Let me out! Hurry! Is everyone here? Princess! The master! No! Get on board! Emeralida, do not weep at my death. This planet Jillucia is my motherland. My last wish is to be part of its destiny. You, young people, you must go on, led by the Liabe gods. May you find another planet in the far corners of the universe to dwell on, and there, my children... And there you will establish a civilization where joy and peace will reign. Farewell. No, get on board! Aaron! Over there! Oh, no! Okay, the last chicken run. Meia, let me get in there. Here we go! Look out, everybody! Look out! One! Two! Three! They're waking up. Hey, are we still alive? The Liabe seeds have worked their miracle. Thanks to all of you here, we-- We Jillucians are saved. You are indeed brave heroes. Yeah! This is Genera Garuda reporting. The Gavanas empire has been totally destroyed. General Garuda, I thank you. Thank you for all you've done. I know I speak for all Earthlings when I ask you to hurry home. General, I ask all of you to come back. We of the Earth are prepared to welcome the Jillucian people, too. Oh! Oh, great one, we thank you so much, but we must go on, find another new planet of our own in space, and try once again to live in peace. We, the Jillucians, must follow our destiny. That is the will of my grandfather. Emeralida... May I go with to your new world? Hans... I would like to try to make amends, as my people have been evil, and I would like to be one of you. Of course. - Can I go too? - I'm comin' too. Me too! But why do you wish to come? Because I feel my life would have some purpose there. You too, Aaron. Well, I... Yeah. We'd have the police on our tail if we went back. But, you know, now that I think of it, I don't know how to build a new world. You will be very good at it. It is an honor for us to have you. Yeah! You heard them, my friend. We're gonna continue our journey through space till we find ourselves a new planet and begin again. Good-bye, Naguchi. Too bad. If Beba-2 went back to Earth, Beba-2 get purple heart. Forget about your medals, Beba. There are more beautiful dreams in space. So keep your eyes on the stars. All right, let's go. Princess. All engines ahead. Off we go! And so, heading for the vastness of space, a handful of brave people of vision seek the fulfillment of their mortal lives in freedom, independence, and peace.
