[♪] Here it is. All is clear. Say, kids, checking that pearl necklace in this express office over a year ago, sure fooled the cops. Yes, but we still spent one year in the jail for shoplifting those fur coats. But they couldn't pin the pearl job on us. We fooled them, I tell you. Okay, okay. But I don't think we fooled Red and the mob. They'll be watching for us. Yes, but let's not talk so much and get going. Okay. ALL: Hup, hup, hup. Hey, hey, we're out of the clink, remember? [ALL LAUGH] We'd like to get a parcel. Here's the check. Your check is over a year old. Your parcel was sold at auction yesterday for storage charges. It was bought by some gentlemen who own the Shangri-la Upholstering Company on Hope Street. You can't do that. I got news for you, sister, I did it! And there's nothing you can do about it. Scram. Oh, mister. What? Ugh! [GRUNTS] Why... Wise guy, huh? Come on, girls, we're headed for Shangri-la. [HUMMING] [SCREAMS] Why... I'm sorry, Moe, the bit bit you. Yeah? Oh. Ow. Oh! Moe, Larry pushed me. You're lying. I got a good mind to let you have that. Ow. All right-- Wait a minute, that's the box we bought at the auction. Oh, yeah. [CHUCKLES] You morons. Ten bucks for a string of beads. How did we know? It might have been something valuable. But it wasn't. All right, so we-- MOE: Get busy. Now, look, we got work to do. You stuff a chair. I'll stuff an ottoman. I'll stuff a duck. [SNICKERS] Oh! Hey, leave him alone. You'll cut his-- Quiet. You keep out of this, will you? Both of you now. All right. You've been fooling around long enough. This is a place of business. You hear? What is it? A place of business. Yeah. Quiet, when I-- All right, I'll do it. You keep out of this. All right. What did you say it was? Don't you tell me what-- Come here, you... All right, take it out. Where's the chair? Well, here we are. Girls, turn on the charms and give them the business. Ooh, la, la. Oh, parles vous. Ah, oui, oui. And while they're swooning with romance, we'll get the pearls. Ah. MOE: You fellas have to learn to behave yourself. I want all this nonsense stopped. You understand? We-- Shh, customers. [CLEARS THROAT] Well, ladies, what can we do for you? Which one of you handsome men is the proprietor? ALL: I am. Ooh! Oh. Oh. I'm the head man, lady. What'll it be? We came in to select some material to redo a chair but when my eyes rested on you, dreamboat, I almost forgot my mission. Oh, yeah? [SHUDDERS] What gorgeous hair you have, Goldilocks. How do you keep it so nice? Oh, it's easy. I use a home perm in it. [CHUCKLES] Oh, you're cute. And such a beautiful head of skin in front too. Thank you. You know what? I polish it with floor wax. [CHUCKLES] Oh, my passion flower, at last we meet. [GULPS] This is so sudden. Oh, think nothing of it, Casanova. You are too beautiful to be true. [CHITTERS] [SNORTS] I hate to tear myself away, good-looking, but, uh, I'd like to look at some of the material. Oh, I'd be glad to show them to you. Right this way. Oh, come here, handsome. Go ahead, honey, look at the furniture too. Oh, you have such beautiful eyes. What's the matter with my eyes? Do they look like halvah? This one is all right. [ALL LAUGHING] MOE: I read in books about romances starting like this but I-- I never knew it could ever happen to me. LARRY: Love is a funny thing. You never know how it's gonna strike or where. FIFI: How can any woman resist such handsome men? You boys are really out of this world. SHEMP: I often wondered what makes me so irresistible to women. FIFI: Oh, it's your good looks. One look at you, and, boom, she's your slave. SHEMP: Oh, you're only saying that because you know it's true. [ALL LAUGHING] You know, chéri, I bet that you are a regular lady-killer. Oh, sure. The ladies take one look at him and drop dead. [ALL LAUGHING] Oh, yeah? I've been asked to get married lots of times. Who asked you? My father and mother. [ALL LAUGHING] Do you believe in love at first sight? I sure-- [FABRIC TEARING] Hey, look what she's doing to that chair. She's only testing the material. Testing it? She's making noodles out of it. Wait a minute. Hey, lay off. Oh, uh, I'm not doing anything. Well, this chair was sold. Maybe the customer won't take it. Oh, yes, he will, good-looking. [CHUCKLES] Let's search this filing cabinet. Maybe the pearls are in here. Yeah. Ooh. Oh, honey, I am so sorry. It's all right. I'm okay. Keep searching. We gotta find those pearls. I was just testing the material for strength. That's nothing to get mad about, adorable. Oh, no? How would you feel if I stepped up to you and did this, huh? Ha! Oh, a playboy, huh? Yeah. What do you doing--? What are you doing? Oh, yeah? There's that. [CHUCKLES] Okay. Let's shake and be pals. Okay, dear. Let go of that sleeve. Quit it, you bully. I ought to-- Don't you hit me. Oh, looking for trouble, eh? There. [CHOKED SCREAM] Oh. [SCREAMS] There. [WHIMPERS] Look, my hair. Oh, a toughie, eh? Ow! Ow! Ow! Oh! Oh--! Oh--! Oh--! Oh, a wise dame, eh? Oh! Oh! Get me a dog, will you? [STOOGES WHIMPERING] Hey, kids. Yeah? I found the pearl case but it's empty. Maybe one of them has the necklace in his pocket. Could be. Let's give them the lovey-dovey stuff and search them. Yeah. Oh, did she hurt my poor little boy? Sorry. Oh-- Oh... Oh, you mustn't be mad, sugar pie. I was only playing. You should be playing tackle on a football team. Oh, don't be angry. Mwah. [WHIMPERS] Mwah. [CHUCKLES] Oh... [SNAPS] [GASPS] [GASPING] Oh. [GIGGLES] Mwah. [TITTERS] See, the circus trainer's jostling, so the mouse says to the elephants: "Wait a minute, fellas, let's be careful not tread on each other." [BOTH LAUGH] Ain't that a dilly? [BLOWS] What's up, Mugsy? I tail the three dames to this joint. You think they ditched the pearls here? Yeah, here's what we'll do. We'll... Suppose you give Fifi a great big kiss. Oh, gee, what if my scoutmaster walked in and caught me? We'll take the chance. [SPUTTERS] [LAUGHING] Oh, no, no, no. I can't stand it when you tickle me. Oh, you cannot stand to be tickled, eh? No. [LAUGHING] Oh. [CHITTERING] [LAUGHING] No more. [PANTING] [GRUNTS] Moe. Larry. Give me a hand, I'm having clutch trouble. Come on. Come on. Oh. Why you... Hey, you, come here. LARRY: All right, get hold of him. Here, get around. There. Get that. Now, get on it. ALL: Heave-ho! Heave-ho! Heave-ho! Heave... MOE: Heave. LARRY: Ho. ALL: Oh! [ALL GROANING] Come here, you. Oh. You nitwit. Oh, are you all right, chéri? I guess so. Hey, I hope I didn't bust the beads. [GASPS] Oh, I could sure love a man who'd give me beads like that. Here they are. They're yours. MUGSY: Oh, no, they're mine. Oh! Mugsy, give me those pearls. STOOGES: Pearls! That's right, bub, 50,000 bucks' worth. And we're taking them with us. Don't let them have them. They belong to us. I don't understand this, buddy, but I'll fight for the woman that loves me. Go on, annihilate him. Why... Wait until you see him handle himself, ha! Go ahead, gunpowder. [GROANING] Oh-- Oh. [GRUNTING] What are you doing here? Come on. What is this, a housing shortage? Get out of here. Don't you lay an egg on me. [THUGS LAUGHING] Ow. Ooh. Hey, hey. Ow. Now, cut it out, I tell you. I'll-- Now, take it easy. I'll get you. Whoa! Why you-- Wait a minute. Take it easy. I'll murder you, you rat. No. [BODY THUDS] Ah. Come up. Get up and fight like a man. MOE: Get up and fight like a man. Come on, you rat. Moe. Moe. Don't go away, I'll get you water. So you babes try to double cross me, huh? Well, well, now-- Mugsy, you touch us and I'm gonna let you have it. You do and I'll smear your pretty kisser all over this joint. WOMAN: Keep away. I'm warning you. I'm gonna get you anyway. Oh! [CHUCKLES] That took care of him. He won't bother you-- Ooh--! Ooh! Oh! [SCREAMS] Where's Moe? Why you-- Let go of me. SHEMP: Whoa! [GROANS] [SCREAMS] Can't we just--? Ah! I'm gonna get those fellas this time and really fix them. I'm gonna get-- Ah! Nice going, toots. Give me that. Now, you scram out of here. Now, for a little flat work. [IRON HISSES] [SCREAMING] [IRON HISSES] [SCREAMING] [IRON HISSES] [SCREAMING] [IRON HISSES] [SCREAMING] [IRON HISSES] [SCREAMING] [IRON HISSES] [SCREAMING] [ALL WHIMPERING] [SHEMP SCREAMING] Oh! Ah--! Ah! [ALL SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY] [IRON HISSES] [SCREAMING] [IRON HISSES] [SCREAMS] Knock him cold. [GROWLS] Oh! Oh! [SCREAMING] Are you okay, chéri? Yes, I am, sweetheart. But this did the trick. Baby, I love you. Mwah. [IRON HISSES] [WHIMPERING] What's the matter? I got hot lips. [CHUCKLES] Well, sugar, here's your pearls. Ah, thanks. But they're not really ours. We're returning them to the rightful owners. You know, you're not much to look at but, baby, I'd go for you. That goes for me too, cutie. And that goes for me three, baby. Mm, yum, yum. You know, honey, you're the kind of girl I always dream about. A rose-covered cottage. Those big beauti-- [IRON SIZZLING] I smell something burning. Somebody's roasting a ham. Ow! It's me! Water, water, water. Whoa! [SHEMP GROANING] [SCREAMING] Ah. Ah. Ah. [FAN WHIRRING] [SCREAMING] Oh! Oh, oh, oh! What--? Oh, no wonder. I-- [CHUCKLING] Oh, pardon me. You excuse me. [FAN WHIRRING] Oh! Oh! Oh! [♪]
