(thunder cracking) - [Jennifer Voiceover] Maybe this isn't happening. Maybe it's only a dream. Just lie down in the cool, dark water. Just lie down, close your eyes, and it will all be over soon. (ominous music) When did it all start to fall apart? (dramatic synth music) How did it all go to hell? (film projector clicking) (moaning) - Yes, oh, oh! Oh yes, oh yes! Oh yeah! Oh my god, oh, I didn't know it would be like this. - You do now, baby. Live to ride, ride to live. - Oh yeah, oh, oh yeah! Oh yeah, give it to me! (moaning) Oh yeah, oh, oh yeah! Oh yeah, give it to me! - [Jessica] What are you doing, Jennifer? (suspenseful music) - Jessica? Help her, somebody help her! (yelps) - Cut, cut cut! What the fuck is this? (sobbing) (screaming) - Let me go! Okay, I'm sorry! I'm sorry! (water dripping) (laughing) (ominous music) (sobbing) (giggling) - [Denver] How are you feeling today, Jennifer? - Wonderful. - Yes, that persurambrals, terrific stuff. Truly the state of the art in antipsychotic medicine. It appears that a Mr. Nasty Nat is dropping all criminal charges against you. - Who? - The little fellow whose testicles you ruptured, and whose corneas you scratched. - Oh, him. - The only matter that hasn't been resolved to my satisfaction, outside of your deeply-ingrained sexual compulsions, which led to this highly questionable and dubious form of employment, regards the words you screamed out at the end of your latest episode. You said, half a second, "Help her." "Help her." When asked by the police to whom you were referring, you claimed to have no recollection of uttering this at all. - That's true, I can't remember any of it. - What do you think you meant? - Jessica. I don't know. - Help whom, Jennifer? Help whom? - Myself. I must have been crying out for help, and here I am now, helped. - (sighs) Jennifer. How long has it been since you spent some time with your parents? - Two, three years. - I've been in touch with them. They've agreed to take care of you. I think they'd be a good influence on you at this point in your life. I know I'd feel comfortable signing your release under those circumstances. - That would be for the best. - Then it's settled. You promise, take your medicine like a good girl? (laughs) - Yes, Doctor, absolutely. I'll be a very good girl. - Then I'm gonna take a chance on you, a big chance. Don't let us down, Jennifer.

Look, hey, pussy, pussy, pussycat. Come on, girl. (growls) - Fuck off! (whooping) - Come on! Yeah, come on, get over. (engine sputters) (whooping) Yeah! (whooping) Yeah! - Get that, boy! - Yeah! - Yeah! - Go! - Come on! Yeah, I got her! I got the trail now! - Go on, Robert! - Shake your leg, girl, ain't you? Yeah. - Here we go, here we go. - Ain't nothing wrong with her. - Run away, little girl! - Teach you to fire up, yeah! (whooping) Come on, baby girl! - We got a good one today. Yeah, come on, Robert! - Oh yeah. - All right. (cackling) Don't you look precious like that? - She don't look like a naughty girl at all. - Lucky we know better. - Ain't it, though? (engine revs) (whooping) - Violence Onelove in the high desert! - Guilty Karma on safari! (energetic rock music) (shouting) - What happened to those guys? - We ran them straight to hell. How's that sound to you? - Delightful. - Oh, you're bleeding. - Thanks. - Looks like the desert almost gobbled you up. - Yeah, they ran my car into a ditch, and it won't start. - You poor thing. People these days, they're just animals. They're just animals. Huh. - What? - I don't mean to stare, but I've never seen eyes quite like that before. How would you describe that color? Dolphin magic green? - Dolphin magic? - It's what they remind me of, the Mediterranean Sea at dawn, shimmering liquid magic. - I've never been to the Mediterranean before. - Neither have I, and now I don't have to. - I can't believe this. My clothes are destroyed. I'm in the middle of the desert. What am I supposed to do? - You're asking me? - Yeah. No, I don't know. - Look, you can stay with us tonight. We'll drive you into town in the morning. - Oh, thanks, but I'd rather... Oh wait, wait. First thing in the morning? - First thing. - Oh, my medicine's in the car. - Oh, don't worry about that, I'll go get that. In the meantime, Violence and Guilty here will escort you back to base camp. What's your name? - Jennifer. - Jennifer. It's all right, sugar, we won't bite. - We won't? (eerie music) - Where are you guys from? - Same place you're from, cosmic oneness, baby. - That's where we begin, and where we end up. Everything else in-between is just a joke. Just a big joke. That's what Damon says. - Damon? - He's on fire all the time! Char-boiled black with the glory of the unspeakable word. - Roasting from the inside out, and the outside in. Emerging in perfect grace, as white as bone. - Is it much farther to camp? (laughing) You guys. You guys, wait up! Wait up, you guys! (psychedelic rock music) - Fuck. - Doc Warlock, you're one son of a bitch. - Have I said soup's on yet? Did anybody hear me say soup's on yet? (wolf howling) What do you know? (giggling) - Oh, that one is Jennifer. She's just a little wee rabbit we snatched from some snakes. - Poor you, you're trembling. Are you cold? Someone get her a blanket. Nobody ever listens to me around here. I'll get it, okay. Oh, don't you worry about a thing, not a thing. We're gonna take good care of you. Oh, yes, siree. (gentle strumming) - Oh, you don't have to do that, really. - Oh, no, no, but I want to. Let me fix you up, I used to have this dolly that I used to fix up all the time. I don't have that dolly anymore. Are you warm enough? (engine rumbling) (rattling) - Oh, my medicine. - Can't be too careful with those. Is this gonna make me puke? - Certainly. Anybody else up for a little liquid bliss? - What is it? - Strength, freedom, and a whole lot of peyote. - Is that celery in there? If it is, I can't drink it, I'm so allergic to celery. - It's not celery. - And is that chicken? I'm a strict vegetarian. - It's not chicken. - I am sort of starving. (ominous music) What's in that stuff? - Everything wonderful under the sun. (warbling) Let's go listen to Cassandra now. Come on. Come on. - There are places on Earth that are simply unclean. Sometimes it's a whole city, like Sodom or Gomorrah. And sometimes it's dust, divel scratch in the middle of nowhere. Everybody's talking about that McCartel girl. How she's been wandering around for a week with half her skull missing, and maggots chewing on her brain meat. Everybody knows about that. But there's lots of things they ain't talking about. They won't talk about. The house on the edge of the woods. They won't discuss what happens to people who get within a minute of that place. They taste ripe hell. The man who built that house, he died within six weeks of when it was finished. Oh, they found him, all tucked up nice and cozy in his bed. Drained of all his bodily fluids, and sloppily neutered. After that, his wife went a'kilter. She took to copulating in public with dogs and mules. Had to send her away. And then that house was empty for years and years. (eerie music) But cities get crowded, and somehow, three whores from San Antone got ahold of it. They were just knocking boots in the boudoir and slobbering pigs in the barn. But then there was talk. Ugly talk. Now some said, some said that, that them whores were out there, dancing in the woods, chanting hey, na, na, na. Chanting odes to their noxious dark gods. The preacher's son, he turned up missing. The town folk saw bloody red, and they marched straight up there, and delivered their country brand of justice! They took them whores, stripped them naked, tore in their flesh with their meat hooks, and stringing them up by their ankles, smoked them like swine! - Those poor whores. Those poor, poor whores. - Stay away. Stay away, stay away. 'Cause it is evil, that place is evil. Pure evil! - Oh, where is it? - Is it far from here? - Nah, just north a ways on Highway 9. Been abandoned for years now. Years and years. (coughing) - [Damon] There, there, get it all out. That's right. That's right. - I feel funny, like I'm floating in outer space or something. - You are. We're all spinning through the galaxy at a million miles per second. Can you feel it? Just try, Jennifer. Just try. - I think I can, I think I can. - Open up your mind and senses to what's really going on. - I'm scared. - That's just the fear. That's just you admitting to yourself that you don't know anything at all. Anything. - I don't know if I can take it, I just... I want it to stop. - You can't stop life, Jennifer. Not even a coffin will keep you safe. I want you to do something for me right now, could you? Take this. Take it. I want you to open up my heart. - No! - I want you to open up my heart. - No! - So you can open up your heart to me. - No! I can't do that, no! No! (ominous music) No! (psychedelic rock music) (whooping) (upbeat country music) (rooster crows) ♪ You been talking, baby ♪ - Guess that's how they grow them in Los Angeles. Folks up there think they can just stock up and toss it away like so much stinking garbage. Like so much stinking garbage. Just look at this pump. Like it ever did anything to you besides keep your coils cool. Mother of god. - Look, can you fix it or not? - Some of it. - Will it run? - Oh, it'll run. - How much? - $300. - What? - Maybe a little more, I can't tell quite yet. - Can you at least have it done today? - Let's see. Gonna run to Sioux City to pick up a new alternator. Trans is gonna have to be completely rebuilt. I would say a week. - A week! - [Reporter] There are still no suspects in the string of brutal killings which have taken place across the state of California recently. Police are now saying that there appears to be a connection between these slayings and the Hollywood homicides which occurred in Los Angeles, but refused to elaborate. - Well, it's not like you have anywhere special to be. - I guess not. But my parents, they're still expecting me. - Here's a dime, there's the phone. - I don't really have a choice, do I? - Nope. (classic country music) - Hey there, buddy. You know how to get to Highway 9? - [Jennifer's Mom] Hello? Who is this? - [Sabbath] Come on, Jennifer, come on! - [Jennifer's Mom] Jennifer? Jennifer, baby, is that you? - Jennifer! - Jennifer, speak to me, is that you? - [Sabbath] Come on! - [Jennifer's Mom] Jennifer, please-- (foreboding music) - Here. - Oh, I don't know if I should. It might not react well with my medicine. - Well how many pills did you take? - Two. - Then take two tokes, everything will balance out that way. Did you know that everybody's on drugs? Yeah, everybody's on something. Hey! - Use it or lose it. - [Westy] Hey, look what's on TV. - [Doc] Shall we? (laughing) - Hallelujah, going my way? (laughing) - Hop in. - So step inside, my brother, step inside. You a man of God, Mister? - Reverend, Reverend Rich Drixel. Yes, indeed, I am. I'm just a leaf of the lord blowing with the wind, spreading the good news along the way. - We sure could use some good news right about now, huh? I mean, I'm as white as Mary's ass, but these kids, hoowee, I think they're going straight to hell. I really, really do. - Well surely there's no reason for anyone to go to the lake of fire. - There's not? - No, sir, all you have to do is accept Jesus Christ as your lord and savior, and you can save yourself from eternal damnation. - That's it? - That's it. - Huh, that sounds great, really fabulous. I'm in for sure. What about you guys, you in on this? - Absolutely. I don't want no demon sticking pitchforks up my ass. - Let me get this straight. All I have to do is accept Jesus as my personal savior, and I get wings and a harp and all that, my own little cloud in Heaven? - That's right. - And you can guarantee that? - It's all here, guaranteed in writing, by golly, and the day of redemption is at hand. All signs point to it. - Good enough for me, I'm in. - What about you ladies? You want a piece of this action or what? - I've already been baptized, twice. - Okay, that covers you, then. Guilty? - My grandmother was a Cherokee priestess. - All right, that takes care of you. Sabbath, you wanna be saved? - Hell yes. (giggles) - That just leaves you, Jennifer. - Oh, I don't know, I've done a lot of things I'm ashamed of. I made my first blue movie when I was just 15 years old. - Have you ever fucked a complete stranger, Reverend? - No, I have not. - Is that a sin? - It better not be. I've been doing that since Camp Winniehahoo. - Please stop the van. (laughing) I'd like to get out now. Did you hear me, stop the van! I'd like to get out! Stop right now! Did you hear me? My bible, my bible! Stop, thieves, you took my bible! I've got your license plate number, you freaks! - Hey, Westy? You wanna take care of this? (ominous music) - Figured maybe you'd need this after all. (foreboding music) - Oh no. Oh no, what happened to you? I'll take your feet and your hands, and we're gonna put you back together again. Don't you worry, it'll be okay. It'll be okay, Mr. Monster. ♪ La, la, la, la ♪ ♪ La, la, la, la, la ♪ ♪ La, la, la, la ♪ ♪ La, la, la, la, la, la ♪ - What do you think? Is it too Scorpio?

I thought we were gonna give it to him. - Oh, we gave it to him, all right. (giggling) (eerie music) - [Westy] Which way should I go, Damon? - [Damon] Left, always left. - Wee! - Ride them, cowboy. - I just peed myself and I'm not kidding. - Where the bloody hell is this place, anyway? - Yeah, I'm antsy and horny and I don't even know what else. - [Damon] There it is. - It's locked. - So go around and check it out. And don't break any windows if you don't have to! (glass shattering) (knocks) - Come on, guys, let me in. Come on! - What's up, Westerman? - [Sabbath] I know you're in there. - This place gives me the heebie jeebies. - We spent 72 hours laying low in a hospital morgue and this dump freaks you out?

(gentle guitar music) - Oh, are you okay? - Yeah. - Maybe two tokes was too much. You know, Jennifer is such a nice name. It's the kind of name that a girl has and everybody likes her, and she always has a boyfriend. - What's your real name? - Well, my Christian name is Delores, but Damon would have none of that. - What did your parents think about Sabbath Jones? - They don't know Sabbath Jones. I got out of that house as fast as I could, find that ultra groovy street scene I heard so much about. - Well did you? - It found me. I was really messed up when Damon found me. He's never asked me to do anything like all the other guys. Not a single thing. What about you? - Oh, I had parents once, but they went away when my sister died, and left these awful old people in their place. - How'd she die? - She drowned. - She drowned? - Yeah. That's a terrible way to die. - Yeah, we were arguing about something, and she took off, you know how kids are, and when I came back, she was drowned. - Do you miss her? - Oh, terribly, every second of every day. It's like we had our own secret language, and she was the only person that I could really ever talk to. - I'd like to have a secret language. - Yeah. - Yeah. - What is that? - That's just our mark. - What does it mean? - I guess it means we're a family now. Hush. Don't think anymore about anything. (shouting) (gentle guitar music) - I didn't know there were still people like you out there. - [Damon] People like us? - Yeah. Real life flower children. - Well there are, and a lot more than most people would like to believe. - Why aren't you in there? - Me, what about you? - I asked you first. (giggles) - Cripples don't like water. - How long have you needed those? - Since I was a kid. Doctors told Mom I was the very last Polio victim of my generation. That I was chosen by God. - And you believed that? - Yes. - Jennifer, I need you, Jennifer, come on! Jennifer! (whooping) - Go on. This day isn't gonna last forever, you know. Go on. (ominous music) (gentle guitar music) (shouting) - [Jennifer Voiceover] I can do anything I want. I can stay here in these woods forever. (eerie music) (locusts chirping) - [Whispering Voice] Jennifer. - You were supposed to be watching each other! - You were supposed to be watching each other! That's what you're here for! - [Jennifer] I'm not the bad one. I'm not, I'm not, I'm not! I'm the good one! I'm the good one! (splashing) - [Guilty] The fuck? (laughing) Some people just don't know how to have a good time! - You said it, sister. (ominous music) - [Whispering Voice] Come with us. Jennifer. Jennifer. Jennifer. - Should've done her right in the desert. She's not one of us. - She is, that's the whole problem. (gentle music) (eerie music) (child giggling) (gasps) (ominous music) - This isn't a dream, you know. It would be wonderful if you could just wake up, but there's only this, and death. - Have you seen my friend? - Yes. But they saw her first. - [Jennifer] Sabbath? - No, no, she's resting. She's at peace. You're the one that needs to worry. They don't like you. Not like they like me. I'm an entertainer. Would you like to see? Lights, music, please. (eerie circus music) (humming) (applauding) You see, they love me. Let's see how I make them smile. (grunts) (splashing) - Sabbath? (flies buzzing) Sabbath? (ominous music) (gasps) - What goes on here? - Oh, that's nice, that's really nice. - It wasn't me. I swear it wasn't me, really, it was... It was the man in the hat, and I hit him with the rock. - The man in the hat? What kind of hat did he have? - It was a tall, flat, funny hat, and it just floated down the stream. - Merrily? - What? - Did it float merrily down the stream, Jennifer, or did it just kinda float? - No, I have to go away. I have to get back, gotta go back! - [Damon] What does that mean, back? Back where? What's back there that you're not running away from as fast as you can, Jennifer? Damn fine handiwork, actually. - What happened, Sabbath? Come on, talk to me, baby doll. - [Guilty] Oh, corpses can't talk, silly. - Yes, they can. - How? - A seance. - Yes, let's hold a seance. - That's a damn fine idea. It'll be just like making a collect call from the other side, huh? - Ah, I ain't messing with none of that Ouija shit. Now way, y'all can do what you want to, but count me out of that. (ominous music) - Lieutenant Westerman, what have I told you about getting confused between reality and make believe? We all know where that leads, Westy. Go see what poor little Sabbath Jones has to say about all of this, 'cause she sure knows what's going on now. What is that supposed to be? - [Guilty] Pentagram. - [Damon] That's not a pentagram, it has six sides. - [Violence] Guilty, you're a total idiot. Can't you do anything right? - [Guilty] No one taught me how to make. - What goes down? - You know, I was just thinking, Damon. You never listened to a word Sabbath said when she was alive. Why is she so interesting now that she's dead? - People are always more interesting when they're dead. (whispering) - Can you hear that? - Hear what? You wanna do this thing? (foreboding music) She looks so peaceful now. Thanks, Doc. - Don't thank me, thank chemicals. (humming) - Sabbath. Sabbath Jones. Speak to us. Give us a sign. Sabbath? Sabbath Jones? Where are you, Sabbath? We can feel you. We know you're around here somewhere, Sabbath, show yourself. Sabbath Jones. Sabbath! Sabbath! Speak to us, Sabbath. Speak to us. Rise. Rise from the land of dust and shadows. - Liar. Your sister told me everything. (clucking) I can speak your secret language now. - Who did this? - It's all your fault! - [Jessica] You stole it, you stole my life. Jessica. (screams) - Hey, come on out. Come on out. I just wanna talk with you. All right? I know you didn't wanna kill Sabbath. (squeaking) I didn't wanna kill that preacher, neither. They just make you kill, there's nothing you can do. (screeching) (grunts) (suspenseful music) - Better run and hide, you zany bitch! - It's not that bad, Damon. - Ready or not, here we come. (grunting) - [Westy] Dying ain't that bad. - Yeah? Well I'll have to try it someday. (tense music) (screeching) (shouts) - Precious. It's starting to become a bit of a buzzkill, baby. A real bummer. Jennifer? Jennifer, talk to me. I'm just feeling a little bit lonely. Where are you, sugar? Where are you, sugar bear? Sunflower. Precious? (foreboding music) - Ooh. There you are. Just relax. (zipping) Me and the little doctor are gonna take care of you just fine. The fuck? (screaming) (yelps) (eerie music) (smooth bass music) - Let's just cut the static and get back on the road. - Yeah, maybe we should burn rubber out of this freaky scene, man. - She can't hide forever. (foreboding music) - Perimeter or penetration? - Penetration. Jennifer. Damon said we couldn't kill you, but he never said we couldn't play. (giggling) Goddamn her! - Oh Doc. Oh Doc. Oh, oh Doc, you've finally gone and lost your mind. Hm. (chittering) (screams) - Guilty? Guilty? Guilty? (tense music) - [Damon] Where's Guilty Karma? - Don't you ever say that name again! - Jennifer, Jennifer, Jennifer. (wolf howling) (suspenseful music) - Jennifer! (gagging) (chittering) (creaking) - [Jennifer Voiceover] Maybe this isn't happening. Maybe it's only a dream. (somber music) Hush now. Sleep. You're close. Time to sleep. So close now. She's awake. She's waiting for you. It's time, Jennifer. Together, it's time. Together, time to go home. Together. Jennifer. Just a dream. Just a beautiful dream. Just lie down, close your eyes, and it will all be over soon. (thunder rumbling) - Goddamn you, goddamn you! Why Doc? What did he ever do to you besides judge your little head of Venus for a while, huh? I saved you! I saved you, Jennifer! And this is the thanks I get, you butcher my people. All of them! Oh, you have completely fucked my shit up here, blondie, do you know that? Well do you? - But I didn't kill anybody. I didn't. - Not even the man in the funny hat? - Well maybe him, but no one else. - It doesn't make any sense, Jennifer. You're not making any sense! - Damon, can we please just get out of here, please? Please, Damon, let's just go, please? Let me go, please, Damon. Please help. - You look all scared and innocent now, but if I let you go, you're just gonna kill again, aren't you? - You're just gonna have to trust me, Damon. - Okay. Okay, Jennifer. I'm gonna trust you. As long as you trust me. - What are you gonna do with that, huh? (ominous music) (thunder rumbles) - No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I'm not gonna do anything you don't want me to do, Jennifer! 'Cause that's what trust is about. I wanna trust you. Now how are we gonna make that happen? - Didn't do anything, Damon. I didn't kill anybody. - Did those ridiculous quacks fuck your head up so bad that you don't know how perfectly healthy, how utterly transcendent you really are? You're the ace of spades, lady, the undisputed queen of the underworld, and it would be my pleasure, my pleasure to serve you as your king. But you have to do one thing for me first. You have to tell me how it felt to kill him. - But it... - Just be my black widow mama, Jennifer. Just be my black widow mama, and I'll love you 'till the day we die. We can be together forever. All you have to do is tell me. (ominous music) - [Whispering Voice] Jennifer. (gasps) - Tell me, Jennifer. - They want everything. - Tell me everything. (groaning) (thunder cracks) (suspenseful music) (wolf howls) - Kill me! Why aren't you gonna kill me? Huh, why not? I'm the only one who lost a soul! No, it's because I'm just like you, isn't it? Isn't it, isn't it? (eerie music) You look like you could use a ride. - Where you going? - [Jennifer] Anywhere, how about you? - Well I'm just going home. - [Jennifer] I could take you home. Go on, get in. This day's not gonna last forever, you know. - Okay. I'm Randy. - [Jennifer] You don't say. - So what's your handle, pretty lady? - They call me Jezebel.
