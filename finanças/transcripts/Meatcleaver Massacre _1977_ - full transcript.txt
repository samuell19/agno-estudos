[suspenseful music] [man shouting on screen] - Morak, destroyer of the destroyers. I call upon thee to serve my warrant of vengeance. To seek out my enemy no matter if he were to the ends of the Earth or to the inner plains beyond and crush him with thine awesome power. I bear witness as they wither before thee. By these words shalt he be killed. Vengeance, blood shalt be yours. Souls shall be yours until the fires of time are quenched. Morak, deadly messiah, I command thee. Lights please. - Professor Cantrell, if this chant is so powerful, why didn't something just happened when you said it? - Good question. Two reasons. First, the chant must be delivered in Gaelic, since the demon Morak confined himself to Central Ireland third century BC, and that was the language. Second, because the spirit can only be evoked under dire circumstances. Basically, where devastating retribution was in order. Morak was sometimes known as the great avenger. - Yeah, like Batman. [group laughing] - True. A super Batman if you wish. You see, it wasn't the police or government that enforced the law and order in those days. It was the spirits, the gods and demons. They would reward or punish a person as deserved. And of all the spirits, the demon Morak was the most awesome. This Morak god was very well depicted in the 15th century painting we just saw. They portrayed him as having no forgiveness. Once a person summoned Morak, he would owe his soul to the demon forever. Until the fires of time are quenched. [school bell ringing] Next class meeting, we'll hear an authentic Irish vengeance chant in Gaelic. Class dismissed. [students chattering] - [Man] How's the book coming? - Fine, fine. Oh, Vicki. Excuse me just a minute. Vicki, Vicki, you got a minute please? How would you like to student-teach with me next semester? - I'd be happy to. - I got a couple projects that I'd like you to help me work with, all right? Bye now. - [Vicki] Bye. - So do you have any more? - Well, I just got a complete saga from the University of Dublin on Moon Ra, seventh century. [chattering] [students laughing] [Mason growling] - Morak, destroyer of the destroyed. - Glad to see you got so much outta that class. - Hi, Professor Cantrell. Yes, we really did enjoy it. It was fascinating. - Well, thank you, and our next class-- - Do you believe all that shit, Professor? - Look, Mason, it doesn't matter whether you believe it or not, all that matters is that you attend class and turn in a term paper, in which, if you like, you can discuss intelligently why you don't believe it. Do you understand? Mason? - Wow. - For God sake, grow up. Fine, must go. I'll see you in class Friday. [soft mysterious music] - Hey, man, don't burn her. She's the best-looking card in the whole deck. - [Phil] Yeah, Sean, she's probably the only girl in Dirk's life [laughs]. - Mm, why don't you tell us about your love life? - Hey, man, how about Debbie? [laughing] - Tell us about the time you brought Debbie to my party and she went home with Blaylock, huh? Hm? - Was it Stumbrose or Jimmy Nyborg or Smitty [laughs]? - She's balled every one of those guys but Dirk, you know? I bet you never even touched her tits. I bet you ain't. - Dammit, knock it off! [laughing] I'll show you assholes. - Have you ever killed a man, Dirk? You think you're ready to go out and raise some hell? Huh, Dirk? - I can handle it. If these two bigmouths can. - All right. Let's go out and mix it up. - [Sean] Hey, get that bottle. Give me the bottle, give me the bottle. - Woo! Hollywood Boulevard. [siren blaring] [chattering] We'll go see the professor. - Oh, far out. [soft music] I'd love to get my hands on his daughter. - Shit, man, that's tender, ooh. [laughing] Dirky baby has been holding out on us [laughs]. Hey, hey hey. Dirky, Dirky, Wild Turkey. [laughing] - Hey, man, give me that bottle, would you? - Dirk. Cut the drinking. - Hey, I drive better when I'm drunk. - I think you can, man. [laughing] Guy crossing the street, man. Watch that move. [laughing] - That close. - I think Dirky's been holding out on us. - Oh, hey hey, Dirky baby [laughs]. [laughing continues] What do you wanna see the professor for, Mase? - Maybe because it's getting close to Halloween. - Hey, we got to be careful with that big monster. A big Morak monster. [group laughing] - [Sean] Do you got something on your mind, Mase? - [Mason] Oh I just thought we'd go up and knock on the door and say hello to the old man. - [Phil] I think that sounds nice. - [Sean] I think that sounds like a nice gesture. I really do. - [Dirk] Jesus Christ, he lives in kind of a nice neighborhood, huh? They must pay professors a lotta money. [dog whining] [refrigerator opening] [dog whining] - Please, dear, would you take out the dog? He's bothering me. - Yes. - Thank you. [dog whining] [crickets chirping] - All right, Toby, now be quiet. [crickets chirping] Here you go, Poopers. Don't eat my flowers. [crickets chirping] [light suspenseful music] [dog growling] [light suspenseful music] [lips smacking] [dog growling] - Sh, sh. [dog growling] [light mysterious music] [water running] [light mysterious music] [suspenseful music] [blow striking] - We were just supposed to clown around, Mason. What the hell are you doing? - You mean the professor [chuckles]. He's just taking a little nap. - Come on, Mase, we gotta get outta here. - What's the matter, Dirk? Thought you were a big, big man. - Mase, this is serious. [lid screwing on] [suspenseful music] - [Mrs. Cantrell] Oh. Oh, oh, oh! [groaning] [dramatic music] [moaning] [gasping] [struggling] [cloth ripping] [dramatic music] [groaning] - Daddy? [Mrs. Cantrell gasping] Roddy? Roddy? - Kill whoever's here. - Roddy? No! No! [screaming] [dramatic music] [groaning] [dramatic music] - Again, I'd rather not comment on that at this time. - Were there any motives, Detective? - We were going on the idea of robbery for a while, but that seems to be pretty well ruled out now. - Now, are you saying, Detective, was this a thrill murder or what? - I'd rather not comment on that at this time. Thank you. - All right, thank you very much, Detective Wexler. And so another apparent senseless murder has joined the list of other killings that have become all too familiar a pattern in American life today. Paul Tucker, KPEZ News. - Shit, they're pissing in the wind. They'll never make the connection. [traffic passing] [monitor beeping] - [Doctor] It's a miracle he's still alive. The blow he suffered was enough to kill a man twice his size. - [Fred] When will he be able to talk to us? - [Doctor] You don't understand. He may never be able to talk to you. - [Fred] What do you mean? - [Doctor] Professor Cantrell received a massive cranial fracture, which caused major damage to his brain. I'm afraid he may never regain his powers of speech. - [Fred] Then he won't be any good to us. - No, he's paralyzed from the neck down. Here's an X-ray of the professor's head. There's a major dislocation here, and a massive fracture of the occipital area here and here. Professor Cantrell won't be much use to you or anybody else for a long time. Maybe never. [monitor beeping] [slow dramatic music] [machines beeping] [dramatic music] [air hissing] - [Doctor] Well, you're certainly getting a lot of publicity on this case, aren't you? Every paper I pick up or TV station I turn to has something concerning the murders. - Unfortunately, the publicity hasn't turned up a single new prospect. Nothing new has come up. So, how's our patient doing today? - He's resting quietly now. His heartbeat is steady, and his blood pressure is down. It was touchy there for a while. - He's the only witness I have. Isn't there something you can do? - [Doctor] No, only wait. - Dammit. - [Doctor] Any idea what happened that night? - No, none of the neighbors heard or saw anything unusual last night. There's no fingerprints, no clues, nothing to go on. Except for this. They found it near the boy's body in the kitchen. We figure it musta been torn off in the struggle. [distorted] We figure it musta been torn off in the struggle. No indication of who it belongs to. - Want a cracker? You dirty rat. If you wanna get Polly something, get me a parakeet, in heat. I know a guy had a dog that could do Peter Falk. Hold on, but was it great though. Pardon men, am I bothering you people? I don't mean to bother you, but you people gotta put some paper down here or I'm gonna go on the rug. [audience laughing] I'm from the South. - Hey, Dirk, you're getting on my nerves with that ice. - Would you get off my case, huh? - Give it a rest, will you, guys? - Do we have any Italian people in the audience tonight? Hey. Hey, paisans [speaks Italian]. - Hey, there's Mase. - I'm Greek and Italian. And because I'm Italian, people assume naturally you gotta have a godfather, which is true, I do have a godfather, but I don't talk about it. You know what I mean? My godfather's a hairdresser. He made me an offer once I had to refuse. [audience laughing] I'm from the South. South Philadelphia. - Where in the hell have you been, Mase? - Since when do I have to check in with anyone? - Don't get upset, Mase, we're just a little nervous, you know. - Yeah, you know you can do whatever you wanna do, Mase. - Why thanks. Thanks a lot. What's with you guys? - It's just that we've been waiting here a long time, Mason. - I don't care if you gotta camp out here! You feeble-minded parasite. Learn to control. - Supposed to be having a good time, right? Yeah, yeah, so let's have another drink, huh? Come on, do Ed Sullivan voice. Do Eddie. Well all right, what do we have? But before I bark or start my show ... [monitor beeping] - [Voice] I call you. - Morak. - [Voice] I call you to avenge the death of my daughter. The injustice.

Find the evil souls. It's possible. Find it, Morak. [screaming] Make them feel the pain. - Please no! No! No! No! [voice whispering] - [Voice Whispering] They'll feel no peace in hell. - Hey. What's the matter, huh? Boogeyman after you again? - Come on, let me alone. - Sean? If you could tell me what's bothering you, maybe I could help. - Ain't nothing the matter. Everything's fine. - Yeah, like your nightmares? Skipping classes? Quitting your job? Getting loaded all the time, oh, things are just great, aren't they? You've been spending so much time with your, your so-called friends, I ... - Now look, my friends haven't got a thing to do with it! - Then why don't I see you anymore, Sean? - Now look! Now look, there's nothing wrong! I've just gotta get off by myself for a while and get my head together. Now come on. - [Radio Announcer] The high 40s tonight. It's currently 59 at Pacific Center, 54 at the beaches and in the desert it's a beautiful, clear 72 degrees. The San Fernando Valley will have light smog today and-- - I gotta go hiking or something. - Hey, Sean, why can't we go together, huh? - I wanna be by myself. [suspenseful music] [soft suspenseful music] [wind whistling] [soft suspenseful music] [voice whispering] [woman screaming] [woman screaming] - [Voice Whispering] Morak. Destroyer. I call you. I call you to avenge the death of my daughter. The injustice. I ask you. Find the evil soul. It's possible. Find him, Morak. Please. Morak. [groaning] Destroyer. [suspenseful music] [voice whispering] Give him the pain that she felt. [suspenseful music] [voice whispering] [dramatic music] [music stops] - Well? - Ah, his old lady said he's out hiking out by the rocks. He's always hiking or something. Hey, can I have a piece too? - Sure, go ahead. There's some beer in the refrigerator. - All right. - [Dirk] Mase? - Yeah. - [Dirk] I could go out to the rocks and get him. - He'll be here. - Mase? - Yeah. - Can we talk? - What about? - What do you think about? - Okay. So what? Hey, Darlene? - What? - Why don't you take a walk or something? - Why do you want me to leave? - Just go. - I don't wanna go. - Huh. [laughing] [groaning] - Now you have to change, won't you? - Right. - Well, what is it? - I'm nervous. - Me too. - I'm getting so paranoid I can't stand it. - I can't sleep. I keep thinking about what happened. - Well, what does a rock picker think? Same as you two I bet. You fold on me-- - It's not that. It's just wondering if that knock on the door's gonna come. - That's right. We're nervous. - Why? We left no clues, right? Nobody saw us. What's to be scared of? - But, Mase, Cantrell's not dead. He's in the hospital. - And what if he comes out of that coma? - Have you read the papers? Watched TV? You heard. He's paralyzed. He can't move, and he can't talk. Besides, he didn't see us at all. We wore masks. You guys are worrying about nothing, nothing at all. The professor is not about to do nothing. And besides, if he does, what can he do? I mean, he's just lying in that bed, like a carrot [laughs]. A big carrot. - I never did like carrots. [intense dramatic music] [mysterious music] - Police Commissioner Azarella stated that he has no doubt that in the able hands of Detective Wexler, suspects will be apprehended soon. Jesus, I just got a promotion to night shift mechanic at the gas station, and part-time job cleaning up the biology lab. Life was starting to treat me really good. Now there just doesn't seem to be much to live for. [mysterious music] Bye, Mom. Bye, Dad. Goodbye, Debbie. Oh, Jesus. This is gonna make an awful mess.

Couple of drunk Okies found him hanging outta the car. Dead. - [Fred] Where are they? - Downtown drying out. I really don't think they'll be much help anyway. They're too wasted. - What happened? - Well, kinda hard to tell. Looks like the kid was working on the engine here and, well, the hood fell down on him. The hook went right through his skull. Looks like an accident. - Hey, you think this fell on him, man? - He's right. - No fingerprints? - Nothing. [traffic passing] - Is this his jacket? [suspenseful music] Did he belong to any club or organization that could have used this as an emblem? - I really don't-- - Come on, think now, it's important. [traffic passing] - [Radio Reporter] In Washington today, progress was slow in the search to solve our energy problem. Discussions continue, but the high-level talks with representatives of the oil-producing nations have failed to stem the rise of the oil crisis. And now, KPEZ local news. In Encino, the police investigation of the recent brutalities against personnel from Valley College was further complicated this morning, when the body of a second student, identified as Dirk Kramer, age 21, was found violently slain in the Topanga garage where he worked. When asked if this incident, the murder of another student two days ago and last week's apparent thrill killings at the Cantrell home were related, police declined comment. Last month's unemployment figures just released showed the number of jobs-- [mysterious music] Recent brutalities against personnel from Valley College was further complicated this morning when the body of a second student [echoes]. [upbeat suspenseful music] [voice whispering] - [Voice Whispering] No peace. [growling] [growling] [blowing raspberry] - [Phil] You rotten little bastard! - Hey, Fred, how long do you think that body was out in the desert? - Oh, I don't know. Two, three days. We'll have to wait for the lab report. - You know, Fred, I've been talking to some of the students at the university. - My name is Shaye, Detective Frank Shaye. Did you know Professor Cantrell by any chance? - [Frank] Everybody who knew the professor liked him very much. Couldn't find a soul who could be suggested as an enemy of his. - Yeah, I've been doing some digging around myself, trying to get some light on all that mystic mumbo-jumbo he was teaching his class. Seems he was quite a prominent figure in the psychic research circles. - [Frank] You mean ghosts and shit? Aw, come on. He probably believed all that crap. - [Fred] Yeah, so do a lot of other people. You know, I checked libraries, straight bookstores, weirdo bookstores, you name it. Cantrell's name was listed as reference in almost every book I saw pertaining to the occult. - Yeah, okay, Fred. Well, maybe I oughta go back to his house and check-- - [Fred] No no, I'll take care of that. Why don't you continue your investigation over at the college? More students, faculty, anybody who knew Cantrell or the Kramer kid from the garage, all right? - [Frank] Oh, sure, okay, Fred. - Excuse me, my name is Shaye, Detective Frank Shaye. You worked with Doctor ... [mysterious music] [birds singing] [mysterious music] - Dirk Kramer, Sean Allen, Phillip Jones, Mason Harrue. [rock guitar music] [soft upbeat music] - Hey, I'm going in the back for a while. [soft upbeat music] [knocking on door] [door buzzing] [soft upbeat music] - What can I do for you tonight, Preach? - A storm of passion has entered my forest of serenity. The icy winds of lust threaten to blow me from my center. - Oh, I get it. That'd require a $20 donation to the Oral Fund. [upbeat music] [rock guitar music] [knocking on door] [door buzzing] [upbeat music] - Find what you came for, Jack? - I'm looking for a girl named Patty. She's supposed to work here. - If you're looking for a handout, Pal, you came to the wrong place. You dig? - [Phil] Yeah, well, I'm not, so why don't you just go tell her I'd like to talk to her, okay? - I'll see if she's not too busy. [upbeat music] - [Radio Announcer] Movers and groovers, here's a cut from the latest album-- - How are you? - Let's go in here. - Okay. [upbeat music] Rap on the door if the boss comes. Now what are you doing here, Phillip? - A better question is what are you doing here? - Easy money. I have to pay for my books somehow. - Books. - I hope you have something particular in mind. - Well, I was on my way to work and I thought I'd stop in to see if we could get together later on. - Later on? How about now? - I'd really like too, honestly, but I have to get to work, really. No, no, really. - Oh, don't go. [soft music] [Patty moaning softly] Come on, Phil. Quit teasing me. [soft music] [soft moaning] I wish all the guys that came here were like you. [soft music] [suspenseful music] What's wrong? What's the matter? - Huh? For a minute, I, oh, nothing. Nothing at all. - I don't blame you for being uncomfortable in a place like this. [soft suspenseful music] [dramatic music] Now what's the matter? What's wrong? [soft suspenseful music] [music stops] - If he's lied to me, I'll shoot him. Her hands are cold. She must come back, Mary. Wait, she's breathing. Look. She's coming around. - Mary, my darling. Checkmate, I think. Eh, Masters? - You think so? Hands up! Now make it quick. Keep your never. - [Man In Movie] We have nothing against you. Do you know how to use the antitoxin to bring me around before they can separate us? - Take no chances. Shoot first. [guns firing] [woman screaming] - It's too late. Look, now the antitoxin is gone. - Cheer up, Darling. I'm heavily insured. [closing music on screen] - [Phil] Dammit, not again! Damn. [phone dialing] - Yeah? - Curtain's stuck. I'm gonna have to stick and fix it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, okay, I'll stick and close up shop, and you guys go home. Hm? Yeah, yeah, I got the keys. Right, okay, bye-bye. [projector clicking] I know I turned that goddam thing off. [suspenseful music] Oh, man, I know I turned it off.

[suspenseful music] [voice whispering] [suspenseful music] - [Voice Whispering] Morak. I call you. Morak. [wolf howling] [wolf howling] [waves crashing] [children shouting at play] [water lapping] - [Fred] Dirk Kramer, Sean Allen, Phil Jones, Mason Harrue. Well, well, well, now isn't that interesting? Dirk Kramer, 21, mechanic, student at Valley College. Cause of death, severe puncture woods of neck and head. Sean Allen, 23, student at Valley College. Cause of death, lacerations and multiple injuries, massive internal hemorrhaging. Phil Jones, 22, projectionist, student at Valley College. Cause of death, third-degree burns on face and chest. Mason Harrue, student at Valley College. I better find this one before it's too late. I'll bet I can get some information from that kid. - Here's my theory. Sean, Dirk and Phil weren't killed by the fourth man to keep them silent. The professor did it. Somehow, he's been able to call up some sort of power and send it after the people that he thinks killed his family. Now what do you think of that theory? - What kind of power? - I don't know, but it sure tore hell outta those friends of yours. - I said I was in the same club. I didn't say we were friends. - Hey, hey, now listen I'm sorry. I didn't mean to jump to conclusions. The only reason I'm here is because, well, you knew the three guys and you were in the professor's class. I just wanted to get an objective opinion. - Well, that's quite a theory all right. - Yeah, but there are two possibilities. First, if Dirk, Sean and Phil were killed by the fourth member, we're gonna have a hell of a time finding him. - And the second? - If the professor is somehow causing these deaths to happen, I guess there's no way we can stop him from killing the last remaining name on his list, is there? Now wait a minute. You were in his class. You probably know this already. As I was going through the professor's notes, I kept noticing that, for every spell or incantation, there seems to be another that cancels the first one out. All you have to do, I guess, is find the counterspell and the killer's worries would be over, right? - Sure. [suspenseful music] - [Mason] I don't like it. I don't like it one bit. It's a stupid theory. Then again, I can't take any chances, can I? [mysterious music] [suspenseful music] - [Fred] Well, well, well, now isn't that interesting? Mason Harrue. [groaning] [dramatic music] - Morak. Avenger. Morak. [dramatic music] [hard breathing] [suspenseful music] [people screaming] [suspenseful music] [soft suspenseful music] - This is real nice, Professor. I wonder if this is where you keep your deep, dark secrets. [soft suspenseful music] Hm, filing cabinet. [suspenseful music] [Morak growling] [suspenseful music] - Morak. Morak. Morak. Morak. [suspenseful music] Morak! No! No! No! No! Help! [blade striking] [screaming] [blade striking] [suspenseful music] [dramatic music] [screaming] [Morak groaning] Morak. [dramatic music] - The patient actually believes he was attacked by some sort of monster. Even insists his own eye was torn from its socket. [soft suspenseful music] [laughing] - Hey, this is my first nut. [laughing] - Hey. You don't believe all that shit, do you, Professor? Do you really believe it? [upbeat dramatic music]
