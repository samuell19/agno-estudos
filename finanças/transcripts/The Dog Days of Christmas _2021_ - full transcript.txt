Merry Christmas! Nothing like North Haven at Christmas. - Uh-huh. - First time here? - Sorry? - North Haven. First time here? Oh. No, I grew up here. I just haven't been back in, wow, almost three years. Oh, sure. So where do you live? Everywhere, really, I work for a non-profit called The Helping Initiative. So we go wherever the help is needed. No one needs my help in North Haven. Oh, I wouldn't be so sure about that. Hm. - Okay, here we are, 442 Maple. - Oh. Well, someone likes Christmas. I'm forbidden to enter my aunt's house without this on. Well, I think it looks great. I'm Phil, by the way. Merry Christmas. - Aunt Annie! You're here! - The conquering hero returns! Oh, my darling. - Hey. - Oh. Look at you. Welcome home, my world traveler. Oh! My turn! Um, who are you? And what have you done with my niece? - Hey, guys. - Hey, sister. Aunt Annie, what'd you bring me? What'd you bring me? Iris, is that the first thing you have to say to her? Sorry, but she does see you as a present machine. Well, I might just happen to have something in my bag for my favorite niece. I'm your only niece, silly. Iris, if I had a thousand nieces, you'd still be my favorite. Close your eyes. I was helping build a school in Nepal and the oldest woman in the village, some say she was over a 100 years old, made this just for you. Whoa! And it plays Jingle Bells! All the way from Nepal? How do you like that. Wait. I can do back-up. William, you are such a Christmas ham. I love it! Thank you! Wait, are we hugging again? Come on! - Oh, wa... It's cold. - Don't leave me out! I told you re-entry was gonna be intense. - Can't breathe. - Mwah. Mm! I've missed your sweet-potato casserole. And I've missed you eating it... so I don't have to eat the leftovers. It's so nice having the whole family together at Christmas. It has been too long. So, Annie, how long do we get you? - You know I love you guys... - Uh-oh. Here we go. - She's gonna say two days. - No, not just two days. But I love my job also and I just found out I'm in line for a promotion, project manager. Oh, that's wonderful. She still hasn't told us how long. - Two weeks. - Oh. Oh, come on, guys, two weeks is a long time. That's right. And we're gonna make the best of it. The North Haven Christmas countdown has officially begun. There's the tree-lighting ceremony, of course, Christmas craft fair, snowman-building competition. - Snow-person, grandpa. - Oh, I'm-I'm sorry. Of course. Snow-person. Actually, I was hoping to volunteer somewhere. - While I was home. - Volunteer? Honey, you volunteer for a living. Aren't you on vacation? I never take a vacation from helping. Uh, sorry, it's, it's work. I-I gotta take this. Hello, Annie speaking. Well, it's good to have her home. Mm-hmm. Heh-heh. Thanks so much for letting me stay. I know dad wanted me to stay with him, but... Too much man cave. I hear ya. I love my brother-in-law, but how many Lazy Boy chairs does one person need? Yeah. And I'm sorry I'm not staying longer. I know I'm disappointing everyone. Honey, we just miss you. And we're all secretly dreaming that you'll find some nice guy and settle down here. Did I say that? Well, you'll have to keep dreaming. I have a job! And I'm not gonna find a guy in North Haven that shares my same world view. You would be surprised. When I met Frank, well, he was in the last place I was looking for. You rear-ended Uncle Frank with your car. I don't think you were looking at all. You know what I mean. The only thing that's important in love is where you feel it, and that's in your heart. This came in the mail. Couple of months ago. The pictures of the dogs were so cute, I just couldn't throw it out. And I thought of it when you said you wanted to volunteer. "Foster a dog for the holidays." - Mm-hmm. - Oh, I love dogs! But you're allergic, and I'm staying with you. Well, I'm sure I'm not allergic anymore. That was a long time ago. I don't think allergies work that way. You should do this. I think it's a sign. Why else would I have kept it for so long? I don't know, you tell me. You... - Nice to have you home, honey. - Thanks. Whoa-oh... Excuse me! Oh. - Are you okay? - I'm fine. Can I help you with something? I was interested in fostering a dog for the holidays. I had to close the rescue. I just can't afford to run it. Not enough donations, and to be honest, I don't have a head for business. So what happened to all the animals? The local vet agreed to take them in. I'm sure you could talk to him about fostering. He's on Main Street. Okay. Thank you. Hey. It's gonna be okay. Hey, Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas to you as well! - Stop that turtle! - Oh. - Uh, uh... - Thank you. I don't know how this one keeps getting away. Annie? - Annie Blake? - Dylan Hawkes? Wow! You, you look great. I-I mean, you always looked great. Uh... Uh, I haven't, um, seen you since our last debate in high school. Right. Was King Arthur a real historical figure or a myth? - Which I won. - Won? - Is it opposites day? - Same old mature Dylan. No, you were in the historical team and the myth team served you a crushing defeat. I don't remember it that way. Then you remember it the incorrect way. Why is it that we've never been able to look at each other without arguing? I remember getting into it with you... Over what's the best way to eat an Oreo. You have to dunk it in milk, obviously. Split it in half, lick the insides. Save the chocolate for last. Myth. - What are you doing here? - Right. I wanna foster a dog. Do you know if the veterinarian is here? Yeah. You're looking at him. This is my clinic, and, apparently, also my shelter. It was really nice of you to take in all these animals. Yeah, I don't really have room for all of them here, but the alternative was to send them into the shelter in the city. And that wouldn't give them much of a chance. Why doesn't that cat have any fur? - He has issues. - Oh, yeah. Look, I'm kind of busy. You want to see some dogs? - Dogs. - Dogs. Okay. That is Rocket and Banjo. - And... Oh, no. - Hi. - I'm missing Farley. - Hi, buddy. - Hey. - Farley! Here, here, boy. Oh. How small is this dog? Small, pocket-sized. I got him. Hi, Farley, come here. Here, buddy, come on. Oh, my goodness. Um, he's really cute. Oh. Hi, Mrs. Samuels. Hi. Uh, I'll be out in a second. - I really need to... - I know, I know. I'm gonna pick one. Um... Well, um... - I'll take all three. - Excuse me? I just can't pick one. I mean, they're so cure, look at them. Okay, well, great! Uh, do you need leashes? I need everything if I'm gonna get them adopted in two weeks. Seriously? Two weeks? Yeah, that's how long I'm home for the holidays. But it's right before Christmas. And I know that because I already ate the chocolate for December 16th. Chocolate advent calendars are for children. Listen, it's the end of the year. I think the last thing on people's minds is adopting a stray pet. Um... - I just don't think that-- - I can do it? Hm. You don't know me very well. Say hello to your new mom. You wanna get some walky, do you? Here we go. Good boys. Come on. That's it, over here. Okay. Here we go. Come on, come on, that's it. Come on. Aunt Claire. Oh, that's what I love about you, Annie. You always go big. Uh, meet Rocket, Banjo and Farley. I hope you don't mind. I just couldn't pick one. Not at all. I love... dogs. I thought you said you weren't allergic anymore. I'm not. It's just... - Pollen. - Pollen? Oh, you love food, you hate food. And you like Christmas ornaments. Stay. Lay down. Well, sit. No? Okay. High five. Do nothing. You guys are such good little... Okay, you're gonna do it, I'm gonna close my eyes. I'm gonna open them. Stay, stay. Rocket, get down here. You... Would you like to adopt a dog? Hi! My number's just there. Hi! Would you like to adopt a dog for the holidays? Oh, my God, he's so cute. Yes. He looks so cute. For the holidays. Yeah. Would you like to adopt a dog? Dog training? How To Teach Your Dog To Talk. No way! - Dogs a little unruly? - No! Not at all. No, um, little angels. I was just here to drop off my adoption flyers. I thought that you could hand them out to your clients. Sure. - These are great! - Thanks. I hope they work. I've blocked out the whole day tomorrow to interview potential adopters. The whole day? Mm-hmm. Uh, I'm just... I'm, I'm gonna go. - Nice to see you. - Yes. Mm-hmm. Hey. Forgot your book. I won't, I won't need it. See you. Bye! I hope you don't mind them on the couch. Not at all. Mi furry casa, su furry casa. I see you found the Christmas pajamas. You mean, the ones that were on my bed with a label that said, "Wear these?" What are you doing up so late? I'm trying to finish my report on the school. But I found a library in Wisconsin that's gonna donate all of its extra books and send them all the way to Nepal. And how did you do that? I found that people are really good deep down. It's just about connecting them with a cause they believe in. Your mom would be so proud of you. Thanks. So what do you think? I couldn't find any sample adoption applications I liked online, so I decided to make my own. "What's your favorite book? What's your greatest memory with an animal? If you could make one change in the world, what would it be? What historical character do you most identify with?" Whatever happened to "Is your yard fenced?" - That's on page five. - Oh. I just wanna find the perfect home for these dogs. They've been through a lot. I'll drink to that. Cheers. I'm fine. Remind me to dust the room tomorrow. I'll drink to that upstairs. Mi furry casa, su furry casa. Thanks, Aunt Claire. - Morning. - Morning. You think a, a dog will help you meet girls? Yeah. So you need a model for your dog couture? You want to practice parenting a dog before you have a baby? And then you want to give the dog back after you've had the baby? Really? So you wanna rent a dog for a date to-to try and win your boyfriend back? You want this little dog to help you herd sheep? That's what you wanna do? Oh, that bad, huh? I just wanna find a good home for these dogs. Maybe I need to make an application, you know, to sort out all the riff-raff. - Don't you mean ruff-ruff? - Oh. Maybe a Mistletoe Mocha will help you feel better. Yes. Please. Extra sprinkles. Whoa. I, I thought I ordered no sprinkles. Uh, this is Annie's. This is yours. - What's wrong with sprinkles? - What's right with sprinkles? It's called the Mistletoe Mocha. Without the sprinkles, it's just a mocha. Hm, what's the mint then, if not, symbolic of mistletoe? Garnish. So you two know each other? - Yeah, we're friends. - Friends? We were on the debate team together. Which is where we became friends. No, that's where we debated each other. Oh, yeah, that's right. - You had some great debates. - Mm-mm. You shouldn't bring them up, I won most of them and it's a sore spot for Annie. - Mm. - So how are the adoptions going? - Great. Remy. - Terrible. What? Dylan doesn't think I can get the dogs adopted in two weeks. - Oh, I didn't say that. - You implied it. And I told him he doesn't know me very well. Annie Blake. Oh, you're interested in adopting Rocket? Yeah. When I can meet him? - Wait, I can hear you. - I can hear you. - Hello? - Hello. Hi. You were saying... - Stacy! - Stacy. - S... Annie. - Oh. Yeah. So, saver of dogs everywhere. I don't know about everywhere. I'm just fostering some dogs while I'm home for the holidays. - Some? - Three. - And you don't live here? - No. Just home for the holidays. Most people stuff themselves full of candy canes and turkey while they're home for Christmas. But I'm guessing you're not like most people. I can be a little type A. Then we'll get along just great. I'm a big type A. When would you like to meet Rocket? Now let's see, I own the CrossFit gym in town, so I have a pretty busy schedule. Uh, I've got an early class in the morning, followed by a private training session. - How about 9:00 at the dog park? - Sounds good. I know the one. - Just sent you a calendar alert. - Perfect. Rocket and I will see you there tomorrow morning at 9 a.m. Sharp. Yes! Perfect. Who's a good dog? Who's a dog? Oh. Rocket's a good boy! Ooh, I love him! I think the feeling is mutual. - Got a present for you. - Whoa, you got a good arm. Yeah, captain of the softball team at the gym. - Would you excuse me? - Sure. Aunt Annie, Farley has to go to the bathroom. Well, put him down on the ground. - She refuses. - He doesn't like the dog park. - Too many dogs. - The dog training book says... To help him get used to as many situations as possible so he builds confidence. "A confident dog is an adoptable dog." - You've been studying. - You know me. I love a good how-to book. It's okay, Farley. That's it, Farley. So how's the meet and greet? Great so far. Stacy's over there with Rocket. Wow! That woman has some serious skills. I think Rocket might have found his match. - Oh! - Banjo! Aunt Annie, Santa should adopt Banjo and Farley. - They really like him. - That's weird. They're usually shy with strangers. I'm sorry about that. It must be something about the suit. He must think you're a big red dog. You mean, like Clifford? Oh, it's you. Is that any way to talk to Santa? - What are you doing here? - It was Gary's idea. We're raising money for the cats and dogs in my clinic. And, honestly, I think he just wanted to wear an elf costume. Rocket just beat me in the 100-yard dash, and that's saying something. Well, he lives up to his name, for sure. I'm really interested in adopting him. What's the next step? I'll email you an application. Okay. Get back to you tomorrow. See ya, buddy. I think she's one of those people that only need, like, two hours of sleep. Yeah, I'm getting tired just watching her. Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas! Hey, I know you. Yes, I'm fostering some dogs. That's cause for a celebration. How about a photo on Santa's lap? - What? No. - She won't do it. Aunt Annie, don't be shy. Let's both do it. You work for a non-profit. You know every little bit counts. - How much is it? - Five dollars. - Fine. - Uh-uh. - Per dog. - Santa's lap awaits. - Say Meow-y Christmas. - I won't. - What? You don't like Christmas? - Sure, when I was a kid. Christmas is even more important as an adult. Everyone needs to feel the joy of Christmas. And nobody wants an angry elf. Three, two, one! Meow-y Christmas. Just the girl I wanted to see. That snow-person isn't going to build itself. Excuse me? Fifteen minutes to the snowman competition in the park. I've reserved our snowman. Uh, well, I reserved our pile of snow. That's today? I'm still finishing my report. Plus, I gotta train these dogs and work on their social-media campaign. I'm just not on track. And I need another candidate by this afternoon or I won't meet my deadline. Honey, deadlines, campaigns, reports. It's Christmas time. You should be using words like gingerbread and tinsel. I'm just trying to help, you know? I know you are. I just like to see you more. You're not staying with me. It just feels like... I'm very proud of you. Annie Blake. Sorry. You're interested in adopting Banjo? Awesome. Yes. No, I can be there. Got an avocado taco with Santa sauce and a side of truffle oil chips. Merry Christmas, Santa. Hey there. What can I get for you today? I'm looking for Jake. My name's Annie. I'm fostering a dog he called about. I'm Jake. - Is that Banjo? - Sure is. Banjo, what's good, my dude? Um, hey, can you take over for me? Thanks. Come on, buddy. Good boy. - Can I pet him? - Sure. Aww. He likes you. Or he likes whatever's on my hand. Oh, which reminds me. I made you a dog bone. You made that? It does look pretty good, if I do say so myself. But taste is what really matters. Banjo here is my first customer. - Hm. - I think he likes it. Oh, he likes a lot of things, including Christmas ornaments, throw pillows, shoes and my favorite socks, which I'm still not ready to talk about. See how the leash is slack like that? That's good. That means he's not straining keeping pace with you. Good boy, Banjo. Also, you want to say specifically what it is that he's doing that you like. Instead of just saying "Good boy," you say "Good walk." Got it. Good boy, Banjo. I'm kind of nervous. I never walked a dog before. - Never? - Yeah. We grew up on a farm, so we always had dogs, but they were like loose, you know, herding cattle, chasing sheep, annoying chickens. So you grew up on a farm and you have a vegan food truck in North Haven, the town of butter and bacon? You'd be surprised. People here are more open-minded than you think. I'm currently working on a vegan Christmas cake. My sister, Remy, makes the best Christmas cake in New England. Ten-thousand sticks of butter in it, though. - Wait. - My mom's recipe. Wait. Your sister is the famous Remy from Remy's Coffee Bar? - The one and only. - Small world. Well, small town. Well, I better get back to the truck. Fill out that form for Banjo! What do you think, buddy? You like him? - Oh, hi, Stacy. - Hey. Hey. I filled out the application, um, I took the liberty of adding a couple of questions I thought might be useful, plus some references. Wow! Okay. I can't wait to read it. Your sister is a trip. I don't think she realizes it's Christmas. I don't think she does either. - Poor dad. - Poor Annie. I'll see you out there, okay? - Hey, Annie. - Hey. I have two, count 'em, two very good candidates for the dogs. Great. Good for you. I'm sensing a tone. That's unlike you. It's just that I thought you were here to see us, you know, your family. I'm staying at Aunt Claire's and I'm looking at you right now. You totally flaked on dad today. I know, but, like, snowman-building? That's not the point. The point is to spend time with dad. He's been planning your visit forever, counting the days. I know, but snowman-building? We used to do it every year as kids. I know. It's just, Christmas things that we did with mom, well, those are the things that dad keeps insisting on. You know what a Christmas guy he is. And he wants to keep her memory alive. - I know he does. - Well, do you, though? I, I just can't bear to see him without her. Is that why you haven't been home in three years? I miss mom, too. You're acting like you're trying to avoid us. Dad just wants to be close to you again. We all do. Okay. I'll fix it. Great. Well, you can start by giving me a hand with this. Where are we taking them? May I present to you Nog On A Log. So everyone brings a log and then they drink eggnog? - Bingo. - Only in North Haven. - Oh. Ah. - Annie! - You made it to Nog On A Log! - Wouldn't miss it for the world. - Did you bring a log? - No, I brought a dog. - Does your dog like to jog? - In a fog? So this is a rhyming event? Oh, it does sort of bring out the Dr. Seuss in all of us. We're already out of eggnog and that's no yoke. Iris, let's go and get some refills. - Can you hand these out for me? - Uh, sure. Thank you. Let's go. Oh, great. Excuse me, I-I-I gotta go. Annie. Annie, if I didn't know better, I'd think you were trying to hide from me. I am trying to hide from you. - We always argue. See? - No, we don't. What you call arguing, I call friends teasing each other. Hi. Adopt a cat for Christmas? - There you go. - Thank you. What are those? I'm getting some dogs and cats adopted. And you got the idea for the flyers from me. Uh, you didn't invent the flyer. Can I see it? - Huh. It's okay. - I think it's cute. I think you need an application form as well. Hm. Yeah, I'm gonna follow my instincts. - Uh... Okay, see her? - Yeah? She's single, and she likes kids, but doesn't want them yet. See the way she's playing with her friend's baby, but not holding it? If she had baby fever, she'd be holding that baby. I'm guessing from her shoes that she's a professional, she probably works in town, which means she won't be home during the day, which means a cat would be perfect for her. Watch this. Hi. Sorry to interrupt. Uh, have you ever considered owning a cat? - I see you got her number. - Huh? Oh, yeah, for Snowball. She's gonna come by tomorrow. Impressive. How'd you learn how to do that? It's the holidays. You know, Christmas brings out the best in people. So that's why you're a Christmas person? Yeah, that and the fact that my mom and I moved here just before it when I was 14. Honestly, I hated it. I thought I was the cool kid from Boston and I didn't wanna move to some dinky small town. - And I missed my dad. - Happy holidays. He was in the army. So why do you like Christmas if it reminds you of a bad memory? 'Cause it reminds me of all my memories, good and bad. They're all a part of me, and I, I don't wanna forget that. Think Christmas helps you feel all the feels, you know? Man, if you had a tail, you'd wag it. Yeah, like, all the time! Oh. I see another candidate. Gotta go. Oh. Thank you. - Cheers. - Cheers. - Oh, hi. Merry Christmas. - To you, too. Okay, historical figure I most identify with? Bruce Lee. - I totally see that. - Thanks. He loved flippin' around as much as I do. Plus, he wore black. When I left the military, I was so used to wearing a uniform, didn't know how to dress. Black's easy. And more importantly, easy to keep clean. Am I interrupting? I'm so sorry. Uh, uh, it'll just be two seconds. I'm, I'm sorry, I thought that you were just gonna hand me the application, I didn't realize we were gonna discuss it, which is great, don't get me wrong, it's just I promised my dad that I would go Christmas shopping with him. I didn't want to be rude. That's not rude. It's direct. And one of my favorite qualities, as you can see here on page four. I've got the popcorn maker for William. Remy wants bath bombs. I don't know what those are. I can help. - See anything you like? - Dad... What? Uh, you're on my list, too. You know how I feel about Christmas presents. If you really wanna get me something, you can make a donation to The Helping Initiative. But I want you to open something under the Christmas tree. How about that one? That would look so pretty on you. - It's-- - Rose quartz. The heart stone. Your mom's favorite. I just realized I haven't, um, walked the dogs in a couple of hours. I, I gotta go. I will help you find something for Iris later, I promise. Okay, sure. Uh, you okay? Yeah. Okay, we're walking, we're walking. We're walking. We're walking and we're stopping. Yes! You stopped when I asked! Oh, my God, I gotta get a picture of this. Ooh, hey, hey, we were doing so well. Come here. Uh, uh, uh. Come here. And you can come up. Hello, hello. Whistling is the only dog-training tool you need. Randomly whistling at a dog is not dog training. By what definition? - It's not in any of the books. - Oh, I don't go by books. - I go by... Yeah. - Yeah, instincts. - Okay. I got it. Thanks. - Here. I gotta go. Looks like we're heading in the same direction. I'm on my lunch break, so I thought I'd walk Mabel and hand out some flyers. Come on. Oh, she's really cute. Is anybody interested in adopting her? Oh, no, no, no, no, no, she's mine. Someone left her at the clinic a couple of years ago and she's been my co-pilot ever since. Oh. I found a home for Snowball. - The woman from Nog On A Log? - The very same. She runs the nail salon in town. And, apparently, Snowball is going to work every day. That's great, Dylan, really. Now I just need a home for five kittens, the hairless cat now known as Bigglesworth, and Jerry. - Jerry? Oh. - The turtle. Know any turtle-lovers or crazy cat ladies? Hm. A little help here! Can I ask what it is that you're doing? I'm late for the craft fair. Set-up started half an hour ago and I couldn't get this gosh-darn Santa out of the attic. Why does Santa have to go to the craft fair? He's my earring display. See? - Ta-da! - Santa with body piercings. - I love it. - Aunt Claire, meet Dylan. - He's the town-- - Town vet. Small town, dear. Everybody knows everybody. You two friends now? - No. - Yeah. Well, it's nice to see you up close. Do you want help getting him in there? No, I got it. You can go back to handing out flyers. Annie, if somebody o-offers help, let them help. Especially if that someone is cute. He's not that cute. I can hear you, you know? ♪ What is it about Christmas ♪ I'm fa-la la-la falling ♪ The snow is coming down but ♪ There's still an old flame burning ♪ Claire, you made all these? Well, last year I retired from teaching and, uh, had a little spare time on my hands. Yeah, I can see that. Annie gets her busy nature from me. She and I can never sit still. - When she was a little girl-- - Okay, stop right there. I don't know what you're about to say, but it's probably embarrassing. Excuse me, this is my story. One time she found a baby bird that had fallen out of its nest and she insisted on bringing it home to my place. I kept telling her, "Baby birds are terrible. You have to feed them every two hours, all night long." And she kept saying, "I've got this, Aunt Claire." So that night I decided to check on her around about 3 a.m., and there she was, wide awake, writing a how-to-care- for-baby-birds book. The baby bird was fast asleep on her lap. Annie has always helped everyone and everything. That's just Annie. - Aunt Annie! - There's my favorite niece. - I'm your only niece, silly. - Oh, that's right. Iris, I've got a spot for you all set up. I brought an earring kit. Can you help me make earrings? Oh, squish monster, I wish I could, but I have to go see a man about Banjo. - I can help. - Oh, well. - Come right around here. - You know how to make earrings? No, but I can take directions. I remember you. You're Santa. No, just one of his helpers. Today you can call me Dylan. - Are you sure about this? - Positive. You go find a home for Banjo. I'll look after Rocket and Farley while you're gone. Okay. Thanks. Iris, you good? Okay, Dylan, you're gonna stand over there and I'm gonna pass you the thread. Yes, ma'am. ♪ And fa-la la-la ♪ And then... ♪ Someday I'm gonna tell you Okay, close your eyes. Jake, I'm just here to pick up your application. Yeah, first, just close your eyes. My sister told me to close my eyes once and she put a bug in my mouth. I'm not gonna put a bug in your mouth. I'm vegan. Come on, just close your eyes. Come on, come on. Open. Oh. It's, uh, white-chocolate mousse with candy cane and mint glaze. Try it. It... Hm, hm, it's amazing. - And it's actually vegan. - Vegan. Oh, and that bone I gave Banjo had kale in it. - Hm? - Shh. Don't tell him. You should put that on your application. "Makes dog bones." Uh, yeah, um, about that, I haven't actually filled it out yet. Sorry, it's just, I work 18-hour days and I really hate filling out paperwork and, I mean, it's a lot of paperwork. - Hm. - It's like a novel. A short story at most. I just wanna make sure you two are a good match. We are. Look how cute we look together. Fine, I'll give you a second chance as long as I can get one of these to go. I have a friend who really likes mint. I'm on it. - Something wrong? - Yeah. I just got a call from the county. Apparently, I'm not allowed to have that many dogs and cats at my clinic because I'm not officially a pet rescue. Oh, no. That's no good. Well, what's your plan? I don't know. I've got to meet an official there now. Can I talk to you at your aunt's house later? Of course. You did all this? What's wrong? So you built a school in a mountain village with no electricity. You brought in solar power, all the building materials, got the books donated and then set up a fund to pay the teachers and now 120 kids all the way across the world are learning to read for the first time? Is it confusing? I can change it. No, no, it's not confusing. I don't think they should make you project manager. I think they should make you president of the free world. Thanks, dad. Okay, so should I send it? This report could mean my promotion. Yes. Send it. Let's celebrate with a drink. It's a little early in the day for cider, don't you think? I'm feeling reckless. I sold 23 pairs of earrings! What? That's amazing. Care to join us? I need something stronger. Add cinnamon. Claire, where do you want this? In the attic. Uh, top of the stairs to your right. Thanks, Dylan. You two friends now? He is adorable and single. So why don't you go out with him? Because he doesn't look at me the way he looks at you. - Which is? - Smitten. Please. Well, I just call it how I see it. Do you think Dylan wants cider? Absolutely. Four mugs coming up. Thanks. Oh, can I talk to you for a minute? - Sure. - I'll take Farley. - Oh. - Thanks. Wow, there's a lot of pollen in the air today. - It's winter. - Pollen never sleeps, Annie. So the county gave me until Christmas Eve to relocate the dogs and cats, or they're gonna take them to the shelter in the city. - That's horrible. - Yeah. All those sweet animals... - Sitting in cages... - On Christmas. - We can't let that happen. - No, we can't. Does Gary still own the barn? Yeah, he was gonna sell it after the holidays. We have to get it back open. Something wrong? Well, you know, I'm not a great businessman, but I'm not really a great cleaner either. I just left it like this because I was thinking I'd come back after Christmas and get the place ready to sell in January. I mean, who wants to clean over Christmas? Gary, we're not going to judge you. I'm sure it's not as bad as you think. - It's worse. - I know. It's a mess. Well, let's take a look at your books and see what kind of a mess you really are in. It's more of a bag than a book. I-I was gonna go through these. Yeah, yeah, after the holidays. - What's the damage? - I've seen worse. - At least Gary has receipts. - Oh, yeah. Most charities don't even do that. I helped a man set up his flamingo sanctuary once. I walked in and there was a flamingo standing on the dining-room table. Cool. I've never treated a flamingo. So it looks like Gary is up to date on his mortgage, but behind on the day to day, the food operation, electricity, transportation costs. We need to raise about $10,000. I'm not kidding. Oh. Wow. Okay. Uh, how? Well, a bake sale isn't gonna cut it. We need an event, a Christmas event. And North Haven has more Christmas events than any place on Earth. What's an event that's missing? An event-theme? Well, we've already had the snowman-making competition, Nog On A Log... You keep a list of Christmas events in your pocket? I thought this was a safe space, Annie. Oh, no. I completely forgot. We-we've gotta go. - Come on. Come on, come on. - Why? - We're gonna miss it! - Where? Why? ♪ Joy to the world ♪ The Lord is come ♪ Let Earth receive her King Oh, the Christmas tree lighting ceremony? Seriously? E-every single night in December. - Haven't missed one yet. - Man... This town's obsession with Christmas events is-- - The best, right? - Hey. Do you have anything fancy on that list? Uh, we don't really do fancy in North Haven. - We do, like, L.L. Bean. - Oh. I just think it would make our event unique, you know, get people talking. Plus, everybody loves an excuse to dress up, especially if it's for a good cause. Oh, you mean like cocktails, dancing, a-a band. A Christmas ball for animals. A fur-ball. Ooh, okay. I woof you a Merry Christmas? - Barks and beverages? - Are you even trying? Ah. I got it. Santa Paws. Yes! Santa Paws. - Uh... - Um, that's a great idea. And we can, like, use Gary's rescue. It's, uh, it's free. - And a complete disaster. - We can clean it up. Me, you and what army? The first rule of non-profits, ask your family first. Cruel. I like it. So does this mean we're going to be working together? It's for a good cause. As partners? - Partners. - Merry Christmas, everybody! Count me down! Ten... Nine, eight, seven, six... Five, four, three... Two... Make a wish. One! Merry Christmas! Ho-ho-ho! The magic of Christmas never ends at North Haven. ♪ Let every heart prepare Him room ♪ ♪ And heaven and heaven and nature sing ♪ So you wanna have Santa Paws on the 23rd? Yeah. And today is the 21st. Yup. Well... There's only one thing that can help us. A lot more people? A magic wand? Christmas music. Ta-da! ♪ I can't wait for Christmas ♪ Candle lights on the Christmas tree ♪ I should've warned you about my family. I think they're great. ♪ Santa company ♪ ♪ I can't wait for Christmas ♪ I feel the magic in the air ♪ It's the greatest time and it's yours and mine ♪ ♪ You can see it in every way... ♪ Better. It's getting there. I asked Jim at the hardware store if he could give us a discount on some paint. He said he could do even better than that. I love it. I got the decorations from my house. I could use some help bringing them in. - At your service. - Oh. Oh. These are all yours? These are my spare decorations. I thought I was the only one with a house full of Christmas decorations. I bet, between the two of us, we'll have everything we need for the party. Hey, I have the same Mrs. Claus. Which one should we use? - Both. - Both. Uh, you can call me Claire. You can call me Gary. Color. What about this? Red, it's my favorite. ♪ Ooh-ooh-ooh ♪ Merry Christmas baby You know, this purple isn't so bad. Once we add colorful Christmas lights to it, it's gonna look just like-- Free donated paint. Oh, the invitations are ready at the printers'. - They look incredible. - Yeah. Oh, you've got some paint on your cheek. - Here. - Here? Oh. Hold on. You're making it worse. Annie, I know I was scheduled to walk Rocket and I'm almost two minutes late. I'm sorry, I just can't forgive you. - Uh, uh... - Joke! It was a joke. Sorry. Of course. I'm sorry about that. I'm still teaching him about not jumping. Well, it's not a problem. I can pick off the hair. So we need a Christmas tree, there are still some left at the tree lot down by the taxi depot. I've to get the table and chairs. I still have to organize catering. Yeah, I've gotta see patients at the clinic. Um... Um, why don't I meet you at the tree lot and we can, like, pick a tree out together? Right. Like we're ever gonna pick the same tree. I will take him for a walk in just a sec. Great. Jake, I know you're hiding. You haven't filled out your application. Sorry. It's just... We've been really busy here. How can I make it up to you? Donate food for Santa Paws. And fill out that application! How about this tree? All right. This might take a while. They're gonna wanna sniff every single tree. I don't blame 'em. - What about this one? - Mm-mn. Oh, my God. Merry Christmas. You know, it's really nice to walk a dog. It's a great excuse to take a break and get outside. Yeah. You know, there's some pretty good hikes around North Haven. We could show you if you like. We'd love that. Wouldn't we, guys? Right! - You're getting attached. - No. They're gonna find wonderful homes, and that's what matters. You know, you can always adopt them. I can't, ever since I started working at The Helping Initiative, I have never lived in one place for longer than six months. Is that hard? Yeah. But the work is important to me and I love to see the world. Me, too. "We must take adventures to know where we truly belong." - Wow! Did you write that? - No. - I saw it in a cafe in Thailand. - You've been to Thailand? Why is that so hard to believe? Because you're Mr. Small-town Guy. Just because I love North Haven doesn't mean I melt when I cross the city line. This is my home. I've always wanted to raise a family here. - Find anything yet? - Phil? What are you doing here? I own the place, and I'm the local cab driver and I'm president of the Ukulele Club among other things. Small town. People here wear many hats. So... - How about this one? - Mm. Wow. It's beautiful, but probably out of our price range. - Don't be silly. It's free. - Really? William told me what you all are up to, helping those animals. It's a real good thing you're doing. Thanks, Phil. And you're cordially invited to Santa Paws. Well, that sounds purr-fect. Meow-y Christmas. Where am I? Gary and I understand that you need elbow grease to do anything. You guys, this is unbelievable. Thank you. So I have the catering lined up, the drinks donated and I thought that we could hang this up out front. Ta-ta-da-ta! - It's beautiful. - Absolutely wonderful! Is, uh, Dylan around? It's a crafter-noon at the animal clinic. It's what now? Crafter-noon! Ah, now it all makes sense. So I thought we could decorate the trees with pictures of the animals that are up for adoption. So I've got pictures of animals, a hot glue gun and these red and green twirly things. - Pipe cleaners? - Exactly. That's what I said. Then at Santa Paws guests can pick ornaments of available animals and Gary can help them with the adoption process. Are you sure you've never worked for non-profits? I learnt from the best. I've just gotta stick the eyes on Bigglesworth and then I'm done. - What do you think? - Needs more glitter. You gotta make up for the lack of fur on the cat. So how did you get into the world of non-profits? What made you wanna do that for a living? My mom, really. She was just such a natural care-giver. She was a full-time nurse, had two little kids who had time to volunteer, making quilts for the retirement home. You know, every winter she would ask me which one of the kids at school couldn't afford a winter coat and then she'd compile a list and get to school early and hang a brand-new winter coat on the hooks outside the classroom, completely anonymous. She sounds amazing. She was. It's getting late. I better go. I-I'll walk you home. See you in the morning, partner. See you in the morning. Hey. I had a great time tonight. Me, too. Come on, Mabel. Let's go. No, no, no... Oh. My alarm didn't go off. Oh, the power got knocked out because of all this wind. I only woke up because I nearly froze to death in my bedroom. I made some cowboy coffee over the fire. Apologies in advance, probably more grounds than coffee. - Want some? - No. I've gotta go find out if the rest of the town has lost power. Today is Santa Paws! This can't be happening! I thought for a second I was gonna blow off the porch. Oh. What's going on with the power? Is it just our block? No, that's why I'm here. The wind knocked the power line down right past the entrance of town. North Haven is completely dark. Dylan. Everything all right in here? Yeah, I-I got a call from the county. If we can't get the animals out of here by morning, they're gonna come get them. Wait, you can't let that happen. I'm mostly worried about Jerry. - He doesn't do cold. - Okay, uh... Can I go check on the animals upstairs? - Great. Grab the blankets. - Okay. Oh. Hey, guys. I know it's cold. The power is out. Hey, Bigglesworth. Oh... Hey. You poor thing. Oh. It's gonna be okay. I promise. Dylan, I've got an idea. - Oh. - Nice weather we're having. Looks like we're going to have to cancel Santa Paws. - You can't fight Mother Nature. - No. - We're not canceling. - Yes. - Yeah. What she said. - In my job... A little wind is nothing. And a hurricane, an earthquake? - Then we'll talk. - So what's the plan? Well, first thing we need to do is warm this place up so we can bring the animals over. Dad, how many generators can we round up? - I'll see what I can do. - Aunt Claire, Gary. We need as many blankets as we can find. - I've got some in my attic. - Me, too. I already made a dozen loaves of fruitcake for dessert, but we can't cook anything if there's no power. Well, I-I've got a grill. We could grill stuff. I've got a grill, too. - Grill-off? - Oh, you're on. Iris and I'll go and get grill supplies. And candles. We need a lot of candles. We need to get out there and spread the word that Santa Paws is still happening. - Great. - Yes! Let's do it! Lucky it's a small town, huh? Santa Paws is still on tonight. Please come along. - We'd love to see you. - Thank you. Please come along. Santa Paws is still on tonight. Thanks. Yes. What is that? Thanks. Thanks so much. All right. Oh, beautiful. It's still on. Still on. Thank you so much. Fantastic. Hello. Look at you. So beautiful. - Thank goodness, it's over. - Yo. How crazy was that storm. Jake, I didn't know you were gonna bring the whole truck. I thought you were just gonna donate some food. Yeah, I'm an all or nothing kind of guy. I'm sorry this is all happening right now. I'm sure you'd rather be spending time with your family. - I mean, it's Christmas. - I am. There's my dad, my mom and my sister. - Hi, nice to meet you. - Hi, nice to meet you. That's our Christmas tree. We wanted to donate it. Jake, thank you. Okay, Gary. Three, two, one! I can't believe we did it. - I can believe you did it. - We did it. Annie, do you wanna come inside a minute? There's an issue with the Christmas tree. Sure. It's missing an ornament. It's mom. I saw all the cute pet ornaments and I asked Dylan if I could make one of my own. Your mom was always helping people and now you're doing the same thing. I just wanted her to be here somehow. I hope you don't mind. I love it. I'm sorry I haven't been home more, dad. It's just, being home reminds me so much of mom. But I want that, you know? I don't wanna forget her. Forget her? You can't. Your mother is very much alive in you. Oh! That reminds me. I know you said no presents. - Oh. - But... Dad. Oh, dad. - There you go. - Is that the best you can do? - Mm. - Thank you. Thank you. - One for you. - There we go. - How are you? - Oh, my... - What do you think? - He's one of my favorites. Thank you so much. - Oh, thank you so, so much. - There you go. Happy holidays. You look beautiful. - May I have this dance? - Of course. You know, if you told me that I would be wearing a suit and dancing with my debate nemesis Annie Blake, I'd say you were crazy. And if you told me that I would be having a wonderful Christmas in North Haven, I would say that you were crazy. Christmas time and small towns. There's really no better combination. Well, I might have to agree. I can really see the appeal of living here. Really? Really. You know, I've got a confession to make. In high school I used to have the biggest crush on you. I only argued with you so you'd talk to me. Hi guys. Uh, so... We just reached $10,000! What? Hey, everyone, it looks like, uh, with all the donations and the ticket sales, we've reached our goal of $10,000! The rescue is saved! All right, everyone, let's celebrate! Let me take a picture of you two. Oh, here. Okay. All right. Here we go. Yes. - Oh, beautiful. - Can I see? - Sure. - Dylan. Come on, let's dance. ♪ Choirs are singing for the joy and happiness ♪ What? Did I cut someone's head off? I'm famous for that. What's the matter? You look like you've seen a ghost. Uh, I just got a message from The Helping Initiative. I got the promotion. ♪ Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah ♪ It's Christmas You're going to Costa Rica? They want me to start there right after Christmas. But I, I get to have a whole team, everything. I get to pick a project I'm passionate about, uh... Right after Christmas? Wow. Wow. Well, okay. I keep saying wow. Look, um, but it's great news. It's what you always wanted. It's what I thought I wanted. Dylan, I think I'm going to adopt Lucy. Can we have a look at her? - Uh, okay. - Great. Hey, we've already adopted five animals tonight. It's just incredible. Well, you're looking at the new project manager for The Helping Initiative. She's, uh, going to Costa Rica. Wow! That's just amazing! Could you excuse me? Hey, so I was thinking about shutting the grill down and having a dance with my wife. Think everyone's had enough food? Yeah, thank you, William. Annie, you did a really great thing tonight. Hey, I'm leaving. Got a CrossFit tomorrow at 5 a.m. But I'll see you after to pick up Rocket? - Sure. - Yay. I'm filling out my application. I got my name, my address. Uh, that's about it. But it's a start. Thanks for all your help tonight, Jake. You know, I haven't seen our town come together for a good cause in a long time. - That's all on you, Annie. - Happy holidays. Oh. Happy holidays. ♪ All I really want is you Hey. Have you seen Annie? I think she went outside. Probably making calls. Celebrating. Yeah, it's been an amazing night, right? No, not about that. She got the job in Costa Rica, the big promotion. - Oh, she did? - Yeah. ♪ All I really want is Yeah. - Hey. - Hey. I was just about to come in and talk to you. Yeah. About what? The promotion? I heard. Congratulations. - Uh, w-who? - Gary. But it's okay. Uh... He and I are gonna partner up here, and it will be great working with him. We're all good now because of you, so don't hurry back. I think you and I made a pretty good team, too. Yeah, but you're leaving. Just like you always said you would. Listen, I-I just came out here to say congratulations, so... If I don't see you again, goodbye. Mm. Mm. Oh. Hello. Good morning. Why is George walking across the kitchen table? I adopted him. Tsk. And watch. Tu-tu-tu-tu-tu. See? See what? I'm not allergic to cats! Isn't that hilarious? Oh. So you're not allergic to dogs or cats. Oh, you. Merry Christmas Eve morning, by the way. I think that's how you say it. You left the party without saying goodbye last night. Remy thought that you'd started to pack. I said, "Well, that sounds like Annie." No, I just wanted to leave right after I talked to Dylan. Did you two have an argument? Or I guess that's what you call talking. No, he just seemed completely fine with me leaving. Maybe he was just being supportive. It was like he didn't even care. He said, "Don't hurry back." I was starting to think he felt the same way about me. As you do about him? This is why I'm married to my job. Relationships are too hard. Oh, sweetie... You know, when Frank died, I never thought I'd be with anyone else again. I just shut myself off from that part of my life. I taught school, went to crafting classes, made earrings, lots and lots of earrings. And then I met Gary, and he asked me out on a date last night. - He did? What... - Mm. What did you say? Well, I said yes because, sure, relationships are complicated and messy, but they are worth it. Love is always worth it. You know, for two people who say they can never get along, you two sure seem like soul mates. Come on, Lucy. Come on, girl. - Annie, I'm walking Lucy. - Okay. What a wonderful thing you've achieved. We all did this. It was a team effort. That's what community building is. Oh, community building needs a leader and that's what you are. All great accomplishments start with that one person. Gandhi. - Jane Goodall. - Dad. You're that person for North Haven. Gary can be that person. Annie, you know I'm a hot mess. - Please stay. - Gary, you got this. Need a hand, squish monster? Thanks, Aunt Annie. You know, Iris, did I ever tell you that you're my favorite niece? I'm your only niece. And I don't want you to go. Mm. So, today is the big day. Yes, about that. Finished it! Well, I, um, I finished most of it. Uh, I lost one of the pages, then I spilled coffee on another. - It was a whole thing. - So... So, uh, about the-the dogs... Um... I've decided to keep them. - Oh. What? - You can't be serious. I really didn't mean to string you along. - We had an agreement. - I know. And I'm sorry. But here's the thing. I don't think either of you are a great match for these dogs. Don't get me wrong, you're great people, and any animal would be lucky to have you, just not these animals. Jake, you work too much. You said it yourself, you work 18-hour days? Oh, yeah, I do, but I have Mondays off sometimes. You don't have time for a dog. But have you ever considered a turtle? - I haven't. - Meet Jerry. Whoa. Whoa. He would love it if you would be his person. He comes with his own DIY terrarium that's pretty spectacular, and a hat he refuses to wear. He's kind of awesome. Yo. And he's vegan. - I'll take him. - And, Stacy. You love animals, but you don't love animal hair. Have you ever considered a hairless cat? May I present to you Bigglesworth. Whoa! He's a totally amazing cat that won't disturb any of your black clothes. I do really hate getting fur on my clothes and furniture. I just thought that it was something I needed to get over. You don't have to get over anything with Bigglesworth. I love him. Oh, great! You know, sometimes the answer is right in front of you and you just can't see it. Hey, granddad, what does an elf study in school? I don't know. The elf-abet. Thanks, mom. There you are. We've been waiting for you. I wouldn't miss Christmas Eve dinner with my family for anything in the world. Wait, why are Rocket and Banjo with you? I thought that today was adoption day. It is. I'm adopting them. You are? And I'm not going anywhere. What about the promotion? I realized I can make the most difference right here. I talked The Helping Initiative into letting my first project be managing Gary's Animal Rescue. - I hope that's okay? - I can't believe it. Wow! Blow me away with a feather. That is the best Christmas present ever. - Oh, stop. Oh! - Mwah! - You guys! - Oh... What's this? Just open it. You found it. Tha-thank you. Oh, don't take all the sweet potato. I'm not. I'm just taking all the marshmallows off the top. Hey. I'll get it. Hey. Hey. Something wrong with the animals? Uh, no, no. Nothing's wrong with the animals. - Um... - What's up? Bigglesworth and Stacy, Jerry and Jake, that was your handiwork, right? I just thought it was a better fit for them. I'm keeping the dogs. You're what? Told you I'd find them a perfect home in two weeks. Great. It's cheating, but it's great. Only problem is you never filled out an application. - They're way too long. - Sorry, rules are rules. Seriously? First question. - Who is your favorite author? - Oh, uh... Easy one. Anyone who writes a how-to book. You're always trying to better yourself. You're like a constant student. Next question. Who is your inspiration? Your mom. You've got her generous spirit her joy for living. Important question. Do you have any pet allergies? No, but I've noticed that dogs do something to your voice. Two more. If you could change one thing in the world, what would it be? And I've got two answers for this. One, end all suffering. True. What's the second? Make green sprinkles mandatory on Mistletoe Mochas. Which would end all suffering. Last question. What's your greatest wish? No. What's your greatest wish? My greatest wish in the world... is that you would be with me. You know, someone once told me that "We must take adventures to know where we truly belong." They sound wise. So you're staying? No. I'm just not going anywhere.
