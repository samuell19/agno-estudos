Baltimore doesn't work like that. - The Commissioner addressed whether the suspect used detective Suiter's own gun to shoot him, saying nothing has been ruled out. Ballistic tests on shell casings recovered in the area show they're all from a departmental service weapon, which was the only gun recovered at the scene. - That doesn't mean that there wasn't a second gun at that scene as well. - From the beginning of how this thing was reported, we just sensed foul play. - ...about the possibility that someone... - I saw Twitter blowing up. - ...gunshot wound that may have been related, but...

I think it was too much for him, more than what he would like, 'cause he's not into all the fluff and frill. - You've taught me so many things, like how to love myself, family values, and how to remain calm in some of the toughest situations. One thing we didn't get to go over was how to handle this. - I was heartbroken, losing a partner, losing a friend. Hell, the day that he was killed, he looked at us and was like, "All right, man, let me go out on the street and try to find this witness." And I was looking around like, "Okay, I'll go out with you." He was like, "No, you're gonna rush me." So I left, 'cause he knew I had to go and pick my son up from school. So he was dedicated, and that was the last... last I spoke with him from there. He was a good guy. He was a good person. That smile radiated before he opened the door. That laughter came through right as soon as he began to talk. Sitting in a car together, talking about everything from our family to me trying to figure out how a D.C. guy who works in Baltimore and lives in P.G. is a Dallas Cowboys fan.

And that's when I realized that this guy is a pretty well-loved guy. - I knew him for years, when he was patrolling this area. He was a good officer, he was real friendly. He ain't give nobody trouble unless you gave him trouble. Let me say that. - He got a lot of respect. - We called him Scarface because he had a scar on his face. - My uncles were cops. My dad was a cop. My cousins were cops. I come from a long line of blue. And so I grew up in the culture, and so I know it. As a reporter, it's worked in my favor. But, you know, when you cover a story like this from my perspective and I'm talking to Nicole Suiter and I'm seeing the casket, it resonates because I know my mother spent 25 years fearing what could happen because her husband was a cop. - When a cop is killed, it's an attack on American policing. - What else can you give us right now? Anything? - No, I never saw the shooter. - He was there? - Sean was behind the white van. Sean peeked out as I was watching the corner here and from that alley. - Yes. - Sean waved me on, he said...like this. And so I started... - And then Sean went in? - Sean went in, and he yelled, "Stop! Stop! Stop!" So I went running, and as I went running, the shots started to fire. I saw Sean hit the ground, and I saw, like, parts... - Where did you see that from? Here? - No. No, no, Sarge. I ran toward the alley where he went in. - Okay. - You saw where they found him? So I got to that point, and the shots started firing. So I started backing out and looking around. - You don't know if it was from a house or from the street? - No. - So he saw something, so most likely he was on foot, right? - Most likely this guy was on foot. - All right, let me get that information. - In the moments and hours and days after Detective Suiter was killed, it clearly appeared to be a homicide. - Be advised... - There was no reason to think it was anything else based on what was being said and just the way it played out. You know, we had an officer shot and killed in the line of duty. They were searching for a suspect. - He is only described as an adult African American male wearing a black jacket with a white stripe on the black jacket. - They told me that my husband was shot, and I still didn't...it still didn't register in my head. Like, someone came up to me and said, he was a... he was a good man. I was like, "What you mean, he was a good man?" And they was like, "No, no, no, no, no. That's not what she meant." And I just broke down. - He couldn't, you know, say what he wanted to say 'cause he was in the bed with tubes in his mouth and blood coming down, and... I just couldn't hear his voice telling me that he's okay. - The doctors in there, the mayor in there, I'm like, what is... this has got to be...this... what's going on? But no one, no one told me he was shot in his head. - I remember that night I was at shock trauma. - Questions? - People had been telling us that he was dead... it hadn't been confirmed. And there was this great uncertainty about what happened. And my phone rang, and I got a call from someone saying, "This was a hit. "He was gonna testify tomorrow against the dirty cops." It was someone I didn't know, and they sounded a little nutty. So I kind of put that in my back pocket. - A massive presence of federal agents and Baltimore City Police blanketed the area around Bennett Place in West Baltimore, where Detective Sean Suiter was shot in the head earlier this week. Police believe the killer is still in Baltimore. - The initial information that we had to work our way through was from Detective Bomenka, who was obviously traumatized by the fact that he was just with his partner, at least his partner that day, who was shot. We were under the impression, based on some tips that we got, that a suspect was on the loose in the community. - Police had guns drawn, waiting to move in, and used an armored car as they searched for a suspect.

He had this sawed-off shotgun out like this, like they actually had a suspect! - The regular people in Harlem Park, they had nothing to do with any of this, but the abuse that they were willing to subject them to, police that don't serve and protect them, police that abuse them... who said, "Oh, we don't care that we are supposed to be "operating constitutionally now.

So I hit the streets, and I hit them hard, and I've done everything from selling crack to heroin and back and forth again, and I had some good times, and I had some bad times. And I made some really, really good friends that I thought would last forever. And one of them friends put a gun right to my head. So I've pretty much, like, saw everything in the streets and... in that time, you learn about these police officers. You learn about how they move and how they operate. You learn the intricate part they play into the world that...that we lived in. I'm a person who has seen the ugly side of law enforcement. - It's now been 16 days since the shooting of Sean Suiter. It happened back there where that blue tarp is, back through this very narrow little area, with very little opportunity for people to see what may have happened back there. The Suiter case is not the first time the Baltimore Police Department was criticized for "sloppy scenes," for not having proper incident command. And, I mean, one of the questions that exists right now is, how come this department can't get it right? They didn't take photographs. They didn't properly record parts of the crime scene. There were people traipsing in and out of that scene at will. The suicide theory, which did come up today, is just a possible theory. The commissioner says it's not a leading theory at all, but it is under consideration. There was this "mistake made" about the entry wound, allegedly by the hospital, that identified the entry wound as the left side of the head as opposed to the right side of head. Well, if his gun... if his radio is in his left hand, which it was, and he's right-handed, think of what you have do to get yourself to get a gunshot wound into the left side of the head and kill yourself, okay? So that information, which they operated on for four days until it was cleared up at autopsy, that, no, no, no, it's the right side of the head and it's a close contact gunshot wound, which is very indicative of potentially a self-inflicted wound. So, for four days, this investigation operated on a false assumption. And that is that he was shot on the left side of the head. - The suicide theory emerged because there was factions within the police department that believed there was a cover-up taking place, that they were chasing a phantom killer, that they were having a hero's funeral, and they were offering a giant reward and tearing apart the city looking for somebody who didn't exist. But once that emerged, once that got into the public domain, people started to believe that that was a cover-up, that that was an attempt for a police department that was making no inroads on solving the killing of one of their own and was trying to sort of redirect people and blame the officer himself. Both views of the case are grounded in a distrust of the police department. - And so now you have, was this a homicide, or was this a suicide? You're in that hole without a lot of facts. I think it quickly became, well, which one do we have evidence for, and which one do you believe? I'm not paid to tell you what I think. I'm paid to tell you what I know, and we don't know shit about this case. - A week after Baltimore detective Sean Suiter was shot and killed, the revelation from the city's police commissioner was stunning. Suiter was set to testify before a federal grand jury the next day against eight elite Baltimore officers already indicted in a police corruption investigation. - And that was... wow. This certainly throws a wrinkle on the case big-time. - Suiter wasn't just any officer who was shot and killed. He was also a federal witness against other police officers. - If I'm about to go to court and you're supposed to testify on me, and now you're gone? Come on. - It was a lot of reporting about what he knew, what he didn't know, what he was going to testify to. Was he going to get pulled into this big, massive scandal? Was he a dirty cop? Was he a dirty cop? Did he off himself in an alley? Is this suicide? Or did someone along the way in the police department make sure he was killed so he wouldn't testify to what he knew? We don't know. Did he have damning evidence on other officers in the department? We don't know. - You cannot add more drama and conspiracy to this. Being a media relations chief, coming into an environment where there is a big trust gap, I'm trying to open up the doors and give people a glimpse in without compromising the integrity of investigations, which is also important. We know that people are clamoring for information. We say so little, sometimes it's not enough clarity. - Are there any other fingerprints besides the detective's? - We're not going to get into those... We're not getting into all the specifics of every piece of evidence we have. So it was just ripe for conspiracy. It comes to... look at the partner. The partner had something to do with it. It's like, come on. When you know things to be absolutely, unequivocally false, it's hard to sit back and just listen to it. You talk about frustrating and upsetting, it's like... people are just making up stuff. Literally making it up. [somber piano music] ♪ ♪ - There is no information that has been communicated to me that Detective Suiter was anything other than a stellar detective, great friend, loving husband, and dedicated father. When I asked the FBI to take over the investigation, I did so knowing that if they had any information or even a shred of information that this could have been a conspiracy to murder Sean Suiter that was orchestrated by other cops, if the FBI thought that that was the case for one millisecond, in my opinion, they would have taken over that investigation in a heartbeat. [indistinct chatter] The fact that they did not take over the investigation was an indicator to me that they didn't believe that theory. In the letter, it says, "No information has been developed to indicate "Detective Suiter's death was directly connected to an FBI investigation." - I think it's very strange that the feds did not get involved in the investigation of the shooting. This guy was killed the day he's supposed to go testify in a grand jury for you, and he's dead from a gunshot wound. Like, why wouldn't that be a federal case? Leo Wise, the Assistant U.S. Attorney, told me that as soon as he got the phone call that Suiter had been shot, he believed it to be a suicide. I found that to be a remarkable statement. You wonder if that has to do with the things that they had heard along the way about him. - The information that was given to me by the FBI and the U.S. Attorney's office, Sean Suiter was never the target of any of their corruption investigations. He was merely scheduled to testify in front of a grand jury about an ongoing corruption investigation. They told me, in fact, word for word, "Sean Suiter was not a dirty cop." - March 1, 2017, earlier that year, seven members of the Baltimore Police Department are arrested. - The case began about a year ago. It involved a covert investigation. The seven defendants were members of the Gun Trace Task Force. I'm Sergeant Wayne Jenkins of the Gun Trace Task Force. - Their job was to go out and get guns off of people that were illegally possessing them and carrying them on the streets of Baltimore. Unfortunately, we found out the methodology they were using to go out there and do it. - The seven officers are charged with racketeering. Some of the suspects face up to life in prison. Others, decades in jail. - They were robbing drug dealers in the city with precision and investigatory skill. They had black hockey masks, fake guns that they would place into people's cars to frame them. It was a mob in the middle of the city run by the Baltimore Police Department. - Hey, come downstairs right quick. They about to get it open. - They really got them. I mean, they had them on wiretaps. Like, they had evidence, hard evidence of what was going on. - Do not...nobody touches... You understand me right now? - I'm keeping the camera rolling. - This video, taken in March 2016, in the basement of a Northeast Baltimore drug dealer, shows former Baltimore sergeant Wayne Jenkins, who led the Gun Trace Task Force, recording the discovery of a safe they blasted open. But federal prosecutors say the video was really a reenactment to cover up the fact another 200,000 was taken from the same dealer by Jenkins and other members of the gun squad. - This was seven officers, it went on to be eight, you know, charged with just, like, blatant corruption, blatant misconduct. Some of their best and brightest, some of their most efficient, and they're being accused of egregious crimes over a long period of time. We put this here to try to visualize everybody, to see how they're connected. You have these officers who pleaded guilty who are trying to get lesser sentences. Before he became a homicide detective, Suiter was working with these guys. Jenkins is the leader of the squad when they get indicted. Suiter had worked with Ward. He'd worked with Jenkins. He'd worked with Rayam and Gondo at times. Of course, his grand jury testimony was about a case in which he and Jenkins had arrested somebody. So he was being asked to come in to testify before a grand jury about his role in that. - This is the case in which Detective Sean Suiter was scheduled to appear before a grand jury, the day after he was murdered. Suiter was going to testify about this scene back in 2010 where a high-speed chase ended with a collision with another car, killing one and destroying this front porch in Northwest Baltimore. [uneasy music] - On this particular day, these police officers, they saw a couple Black guys in a car, figured they might have something on them. "Let's take a run at them." You can't do that, but they did it, and they did it every day... all over the city. - The only thing true about that particular police report was that we had a car accident and somebody died. Everything else was a lie. ♪ ♪ - This is the actual spot that I was parked in. I noticed through my side view mirror that a car was approaching. There was two cars that pulled up. One pulled in the front, and one pulled behind me. - Wayne Jenkins and Ryan Guinn were in the first car. Detective Suiter was in the rear car. Like a car pulling up not wanting to damage the car, but it was more so, I believe, them to get us tight in as possible so they can do whatever it is that they were attempting to do. Now the car in back of me bumps me. I turned my head to see, and then I heard doors opening. And that alerted my attention to the front, and they was actually out the car with guns drawn, with masks on their face, and all I could see was their eyes. - These were not police cars. Our clients, of course, would not know that they were police cars. There were no lights, there were no sirens. When they took off, they genuinely believed that they were being robbed. - They know why we fled. You know, we didn't know who the hell they were. They were right on our tail the whole time. The only thing we was thinking about is our lives. - I began to go on very fast down Belle Avenue. I could see another car at a stop sign. So I'm trying to turn away from the car, and we end up turning the same way. - Police say it was these two, Umar Burley and Brent Matthews, who were fleeing police and crashed into a car on the corner of Belle and Gwynn Oak Avenue, killing the father of a Baltimore City police officer. - The officers, they realized they had a serious problem on their hands. It was a high-speed chase. Couldn't justify the chase, the stop, nothing. Didn't find any drugs in the car, didn't find any weapons in the car. They jacked up these two men for no reasonable articulable suspicion, no criminality afoot. So what did they do? They got on the phone, and they called in for heroin to plant inside the vehicle. My clients believed that Gladstone was the officer that showed up with the heroin. Matthews and Burley were wrongly convicted and sent to prison. They framed Mr. Burley and Mr. Matthews to justify their own criminality. - 28 grams of heroin. [chuckles] That's a lot of heroin to just pop up in the car.

Now he faces another 20 years in prison, the result of new charges that he planted drugs in a car in 2010 to justify chasing the driver and a passenger. Sean Suiter was involved in the original stop of the vehicle and the chase, the indictment says. It suggests he was set up to recover the drugs. - Obviously it was a concerted effort, as they were blocked in. Jenkins and Guinn got out of the car with guns and masks. It would be difficult to imagine that the car back here, that detective Suiter wouldn't have seen that. Unfortunately, you know, we're never going to exactly know who planted the drugs, whether it was Jenkins himself. Jenkins denied planting them. It could be Suiter... we don't know. Suiter was the one that recovered them. I'm not sure that you can believe any of the officers 'cause it's all self-serving, but we do know they were working together. ♪ ♪ - Getting to the truth in these incidents is difficult. I think that there are people lying on all sides. We do not have an independent eyewitness between the officers and Umar Burley. One idea I had was to do a public records request to see if they would turn over the dispatch audio, so I got that today. This audio is from the moment. This is real time, what they were saying before anybody knew that this was going to happen. I'm trying to figure out how this... was Wayne Jenkins and Sean Suiter, were they robbing people with masks on in the middle of the day in 2010? Because if that's true, Sean Suiter is incredibly corrupt. Going back seven years before his death, he was rolling around the city in the middle of the day with masks on robbing people. So... yep. They actually give the tag number before the crash, before the chase even. There is no doubt about it. They're discussing stopping this guy on the radio that other officers are listening to. I think that's telling. If you're robbing somebody, I don't know that you do that. That's a good thing for Sean Suiter's case that he's not corrupt. But that's with the caveat that these guys lied, they covered their tracks, they knew how to do it. So anything's possible. - A car crash. Guys, they're running, trying to shoot each other. There is a 911 call from a citizen, who is coming on to this as it's happening. And she sees a car crashed into a fire hydrant.

Three of them. - The one with the gun had on an orange sweatshirt? - Right. - There's things on this that go towards one narrative and things that go towards the other narrative. - Federal Prosecutors now say Burley and Matthews are innocent. Today their convictions were vacated. - I may have been released, but nothing has changed. My life will never be the same again. - We've had, as a firm, as a lawyer, and as a resident of Baltimore, some familiarity with these rogue police units. But I had never seen a situation where the federal government overtly made efforts to pull someone out of prison and release them. - The federal judge called their convictions the result of "raw, crude police corruption." - The key player in the investigation of Sean Suiter is Wayne Jenkins... because Suiter was the one who was supposed to testify against Jenkins. You know, I would never say that a person committed a murder unless I knew they did it. I would never say a person had ordered a murder unless I knew they did it, but what I will say is that they're very capable of it.

And I don't mean the core group of guys. I mean supervisors, outside people, you know, and the city police department may not know. Only the feds may know that information.

He says Detective Sean Suiter stole money when the two worked together in a specialized enforcement unit a decade ago. - Detective Gondo was, I think, pretty unequivocal that he had stolen money with other officers for a long time, and he described it as being something that officers did to sort of fit in, to gain each other's trust. That if I know that you're stealing money and you know that I'm stealing money then we've got each other's back. We're both in on this together, and he said he was stealing money with Sean Suiter. - Gondo was, without question, reliable, the most trustworthy, truthful cooperator that they had, and... - Gondo said he was dirty on the witness stand. So, if you look at those weeks leading up to November 15th, what's Sean Suiter looking at as he headed for that grand jury appearance? He knows that Momodu Gondo has pleaded guilty. He was cooperating with the feds, and he was willing to talk. October 24th, the FBI came to visit Sean Suiter. He refused to be interviewed by them, and they delivered a subpoena for him to appear before the federal grand jury. What we learned after Suiter's death is that Gondo told the federal authorities, while he was cooperating, that Suiter was dirty. There's a lot to look at. - He's gone from an officer who died in the line of duty investigating a homicide in a dangerous part of town to having his whole history questioned, is sort of a shocking development. - Before we be too judgmental, you know, I mean, it's enticing. You know, you're dealing with a dope dealer. Who's going to believe him? It's not like he earned this money. I mean, you know, it's greed. It's greed that's motivated this, but, I mean, that's what you see all over, from top to bottom. From Washington to, you know, to Baltimore, the motivating factor was the greed. [sirens blaring] - Sean's death showed me how cruel life can be sometimes. And his love showed me how life can also be good. We just have a lot of unanswered questions. I always believe someone seen something. I always believe that. Love you, Sean. - There exists a serious tug-of-war within the Baltimore Police Department over what this case is. The people advocating the suicide theory say the evidence was mischaracterized and it wasn't explained. There was a suspect. There was a guy seen with a white stripe on his jacket. It turns out, as more information came along, that that was somebody that they had spotted earlier in the afternoon. And people say that Detective Suiter, maybe he sensed that trouble was coming. He's a father of five. There's a financial incentive to have the death appear to be a murder... that that would be the kind of death that his family would continue to receive benefits. If it's a straight-up suicide, it's ruled that and everybody knows it, you don't get benefits. You know, people within the police department, they're pointing to dirt on his leg and saying that that's proof of a violent struggle. Is that proof of a violent struggle? - Hold on, get his legs, get his legs. - We should wait for the medic. - Transport him in a car. Officer's down. Officer down. - I actually attended the academy with Sean Suiter. Really quiet guy, really nice. Always, like, you know... even though he's quiet, he was always smiling, easy to get along with. I would cross paths with him here or there, and we remembered each other from the academy and would kind of like, just like, "Hey, what's going on?" In Internal Affairs, I handled all specialized units, which would've included units Sean Suiter was in. So I never saw his name in a complaint. I never heard of him being involved in a complaint. I never heard a supervisor or another cop ever say anything negative about Sean. He's just a guy I could never imagine even... even doing anything wrong. I know for a fact that there are plenty of corrupt cops within the department, because I investigated some of them and they remain in that department. Jenkins waited for me after work one day at Internal Affairs because I was investigating some of his guys. And he, like, corners me in the parking lot, and he's, like, right up in my face. Like, I thought he was going to hit me. Like, that was it, we were going to go. Mentally I just broke. I couldn't take it anymore. I attempted suicide twice. I mean, for years, I had been sort of struggling with what the mission of the police department was. I was afraid to speak up about a lot of the things I had seen. I was investigating cases where I felt like maybe I was in danger, you know, retaliation from cops I was investigating. I finally realized, I mean, I can't work in the police... I can't stay. I just had to quit. It was going to kill me. It was going to kill me one way or the other. [dark music] I just didn't understand how shitty cops get through that department unscathed, unpunished, and Sean lost his life in that department. ♪ ♪ - When I became the Baltimore Police Commissioner in 2015, I was on Larry Young's morning talk show on WOLB. He said, "Make sure you rent and don't buy." The mayor, Catherine Pugh, wanted Sean Suiter's investigation to be solved in a hurry. She saw it as a stain on her mayoral administration, and she grew growingly frustrated with me that it wasn't solved, and I grew growingly frustrated with her that she was interfering with the integrity of a murder investigation. - It has been a revolving door at the top of the Police Department. This is the third commissioner since 2015. - Commissioner Kevin Davis was fired in January. And the Mayor installed Darryl De Sousa as Commissioner. One of my topics to talk to him about was the Sean Suiter case. Do you have an idea of what you think happened? - I have an idea I'm not going to share it right now, but I can tell you that I am bringing a independent, outside source to come in and take a look at it. - And that was the big headline that came out of that was the new commissioner was going to push forward on an independent review board on the Sean Suiter case. - We all went up to the police headquarters, and they put on a big dog-and-pony show for us about who's going to be looking into this and who's that. Everyone had a great résumé. There's some old homicide cops on there from BPD, police officers from around the country. - It's an open criminal investigation requiring confidentiality. - They said they are not going to reinvestigate the homicide. They're going to look at everything around it. And they said, "But it's not going to be done "out in the public, "so we're gonna vote to close the meeting, and then that's the last thing we're gonna hear." - I want to thank you all for coming and for being so cooperative. Thank you all very much. - And then sandwiches came, and all of the journalists had to go. People want to know what happened, and they're going to try to put something together to make people feel comfortable. You know, they got to have a story, 'cause you can't let a cop die without a story, not in America, definitely not in Baltimore City. [somber music] ♪ ♪ - Could you talk to us a little bit just about your client's state of mind right now? - Well, as he said in court, Mr. Ward is very remorseful, very sorry about what happened. - What happened? - Wayne Jenkins received 25 years in prison. It was not the maximum. He turned around and faced the crowd, and for several minutes apologized for his conduct. He was sobbing. His voice was cracking throughout. - I'm sorry for your loss. - Thank you. - When I look at the whole case as presented, the most shocking thing to me was on April 27, 2015, when the drug stores were being burned and looted, Jenkins was stealing the drugs. He was looting the looters. Trash bags full of stolen pharmaceuticals. You talk about brazen. A Baltimore police sergeant in charge of an elite Gun Trace Task Force was looting. I mean, we had to have the National Guard come in here. That really kind of sums up the brazenness with which this group of people operated. - In Baltimore, there was a Viking-like mentality for many, many years that encouraged the slippery slope behaviors that that Gun Trace Task Force went down. We tend to give those all-star cops a pass because they do what? They go out, they hunt, they gather, they bring back bad guys and drugs and guns and search warrants and cash. - He didn't deserve this. He was a good person. You're either a good person or a bad person. He was a good person. - The first time I ever got kicked in the ribs by a cop when I was laying on the ground for saying something slick out my mouth, this officer, his name was Daniel Hersl. This hero, that was him. [overlapping shouting] - I was in my 20s, early 20s, and he kicked the shit out of me. And I'm like, "Bitch..." [chuckles] Right? But you can't do nothing. ♪ ♪ People in the neighborhood, they knew Hersl. They knew Hersl wanted money... all the time. It's like he always had a bill due. Daniel Hersl should have, like, $100 million buried somewhere 'cause he was always on the prowl. And as you can tell by the big smile on Danny Hersl's face, they are having a good time, and this is just boxes of stuff they're stealing out of these people's apartment. - So, when my editor first asked me to get into the human side of Danny Hersl, I was like, "Yo, fuck that." He lost his ability to be defined as a human when he started fucking robbing and stealing and ripping off taxpayers while we pay his salary. So it's like, how do you get to be a human? I thought that was like some classic white privilege shit. You know, you do some evil shit, and we got to say, "Oh, he was a lone wolf. Oh, he was tortured." You know, I was like, how the fuck am I going to do that? But then I had to sit back and realize, well, you know what? [chuckles] D. Watkins, you did some fucked-up things. You know, you ran these streets, and you did all this wild stuff, so you don't deserve to be treated as a human. There's no shot at redemption for you. I'm from East Baltimore, and Daniel Hersl is from East Baltimore. I like difficult. This is a chance to define a cultural moment and tell the story of two boys from East Baltimore who completely had opposite paths. I started out in the street, and I ended up as a college professor. He started out as a police officer and then ended up doing 18 years in federal prison. [indistinct shouting] Danny Hersl and I have a whole lot of parallels. We both lost family members. We went to some of the same schools. Some of his friends who I got to talk said that he was a loyal guy. He was a person that was down to do whatever for his friends. I didn't sign up for something easy. Talking about race and trying to see humanity in a person that has been a devil to you and a devil to a whole lot of people you know isn't an easy task. - Hey, you the author, right? - Yeah, what's up? - You came to my school. - What school you go to? - I go to City. I like your book, man. - Thank you, I appreciate it. Hersl and I are both victims of the drug war. He was on one side. I was on the other side. Did he have a chance to know right from wrong? Yeah, he did. But he chose wrong. Did I have chances to know right from wrong? Yes, I did, and I chose wrong until I felt like it was time for me to choose right. It's just like musical chairs. I chose before I fell. I take personal responsibility for my actions, just like I think he should take personal responsibilities for his actions. But the one thing that me and that clown have in common is that we both did what we saw. That's what we saw, that's what we saw people doing around us, so that's what we tried to do. - The eighth largest police department in the country in turmoil tonight. - Darryl De Sousa is done. The commissioner of just four months resigned this morning as he battles federal charges of willfully not filing his taxes for three years. - I tell you, when De Sousa was made chief, I got a list of questions from the press that involved his vetting, and I remember calling City Hall and saying, "Hey, we have answers to these?" I mean, some of them were so basic. It seemed to be an emotional selection without due diligence. All of this could have been avoided. - The truth is that the mayor of Baltimore controls the Baltimore Police Department to a large extent. Everything goes back to the political leadership, the political "misleadership" class that seems to always be in office. People have been interested more in currying favor with power than they have with elevating the people that needed their support. The fact that this city has basically bled dry entire communities for decades, giving people nothing, inadequate education, not even a trash pickup. There's no economic engine in many communities intentionally for a long time other than the drug trade. That isn't the fault of the people. That's the political establishment creating that environment. - We're awaiting the final report from the independent review board. I'm sure everybody in town is going to be trying to get it before it comes out, myself included, but we're just waiting. [rising music] ♪ ♪ - Come on, man! Killed himself? Get the hell out of here. That's bullshit. - The safest thing for Baltimore is to say, "Police officers would never kill another cop, never. "They would never kill another cop. They'll never do that. Suiter killed himself." And that maintains the narrative that I'm working so hard to dismantle. - And what we now learn, he wasn't just going to testify as a witness. He was testifying under limited immunity, which is a very different kind of witness. He wasn't so-called "target" of the GTF investigation, but he was a "subject" of it. It means that the feds didn't really know what he knew or did. - They released it the night before they had a press conference. And along with it, they released a piece of video that I had been trying to get my hands on forever. They released an audio clip of Sean's last audio transmission. - [shouting indistinctly] - Which was unintelligible, but there's still some sound there, you know, and... - [shouting indistinctly] - That was interesting to me. And then I read the report. And, you know, it was rumored that it was going to come out as suicide, and then you read it in black and white where the IRB board said, "We conclude that this is suicide." And I looked at that, and I was like, "Okay, now show me... show me where it's at." And so I read that report three times that night. I didn't see anything new... no new physical evidence, nothing to suggest that they can conclude unanimously that Sean Suiter killed himself. It wasn't there for me as a reporter. - Uh-huh, okay. Thank you very much. I'll call you if there's anything... I reached out to former commissioner Kevin Davis. I don't know, in any other town, this might be shocking, but he completely condemned the police department, and he said that there is a culture there that, you know, they were culturally trying to, you know, cover this up because they couldn't handle not being able to solve the case. He also said that he refused to meet with the full board because he didn't trust members of the police department who were on the board. That's a pretty shocking statement from somebody who ran the place for three years. He is an outsider, and he ran the place for three years, and he's basically telling the public you can't trust anybody over there, and they are going to sort of juke this case to what they want it to be. That's coming from someone who ran the place and saw it from the inside out. [gentle music] - Questions? - Mayor, do you accept the finding of self-inflicted? - Well, let me just say this... you know, first of all, you know, my condolences are still with the family. I'm also looking forward to hearing from the review committee as well, you know, because I think there needs to be a thorough understanding of their own findings. - There's no question that the Independent Review Board that reviewed the evidence in the case and the facts of the case has placed a lot of weight on the connection to the Gun Trace Task Force case to the death of Sean Suiter. - The commissioner says, "Okay, there was a man in a black leather jacket." - Right, and that is what the report says. And the report reveals that there were some inaccuracies. - Knowing what you know now, do you regret the hero's funeral with public road closings and a vast PR campaign surrounding it? - Well, I didn't orchestrate that, so let me just say that, again, these are findings that are still being reviewed and will be shared. - So you don't feel at any point that you were misled by anyone on the police department? - I think we all... well, according to this report, we've all been misled. - To hear someone totally drag your homeboy, man... Like, he just... That's not him. Like, to hear that from people that didn't know him... It was...it was... it was jacked up. It was a jacked-up day. - The physical evidence definitely takes you to a self-inflicted conclusion. But when you really think about the case, either you've got Sean Suiter who needs to make his suicide look like murder, and if he is targeted because of what he may know about other activities of other officers, you've got someone who needs to make his murder look like suicide. - There wasn't ever supposed to be a conclusion drawn from the IRB. I was shocked when I found out that there was an actual conclusion. [car horn honks] - Can you address people who may be looking at this saying this is a really far-fetched scenario? - The totality of the evidence, not individually, but the totality of the evidence builds a compelling case that the conclusion is very well supported, and there is unanimity on all recommendations, all findings, all conclusions that were made in the report. - To what extent did your investigators look at the theory that many in the community are saying this was a hit put on Suiter by the BPD? - I refer you to the report. It turns out that we were able to exactly time sort of the sequence of events and there was a total of eight seconds when somebody wasn't being observed, and you couldn't get in, do that, put the evidence in, raise the arm up, close the arm... it was not possible. - I just want to clear up a factual matter. It says that Hersl had pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate. But he was one of the two who didn't plead guilty. Was there a mistake? - No, I believe it's the same Hersl. - This is a big mistake. This is a fairly large public trial that we all covered, that he went to trial, and it went on for weeks, but it says in here that he pled guilty. But beyond that, did you guys also interview other people in his family or in his life to help state of mind that this grand jury may not have been the only thing that was stressing him out to make him commit suicide? - Let me just say this, you know, we followed the information, and we followed the facts. We do not attempt to understand what his state of mind was when he took the actions that he did. We can't surmise that about Detective Suiter. We can't. - I didn't know about the factual error that was in the IRB report, a big one. I don't like embarrassment. I don't like being wrong. This shit should be right, period! This is not just a report. This is somebody's life. We're about to tell someone's family that we don't believe your husband was killed. We believe he did it himself. Oh, sorry for this fact. No, no, no, it's no margin for error for that. - Based on the fact that no one knew my husband better than I did, I will not accept the untimely death of Sean as nothing other than a murder... which has been covered up for reasons unbeknownst to me or my family. Sean did not deserve to die in this manner, and no one deserves to get away with this. - Nicole knew that there were wolves. I saw an effort by certain individuals within the Baltimore City Police Department to demonize Sean, to turn him into another one of these shadowy GTTF figures. What does the Baltimore City Police Department have to gain by lying about Sean? - What do you think is going on here? Why do you think this is happening? - To be honest, I don't know why this is happening. But something's happening. - There is nothing to indicate to me that he took his own life. I am the one who reached out to the U.S. Attorney's Office and requested immunity. He was not worried about his involvement in this case. The U.S. Attorneys handling the investigation made it clear to me that they saw Sean as a witness to the Umar Burley case, not a suspect. Now I'm trying to make sure that two things happen... that his family gets benefits and that somebody actually investigates his fucking murder, which I really don't think are two big things to ask. [siren wails] - The intricate plan on staging this for insurance purposes just bothers me the most. As Black families, we just go through shit. We go through shit. We go through shit, and then we go through shit while we're getting through other shit that we're going through... that's not strange. He wasn't some corporate guy on Wall Street running a foundation. He was a fucking cop. He's in the street. He's seen pain. He's been through shit. So to tell me that he can't stomach doing a little three, four years in the joint, come on, man. - Your partner is close by in daylight... in a fairly populated part of town, and you are going to contort yourself in a way that makes it look like someone killed you, but you're killing yourself. You're going to fire three shots, two of them randomly and then the third into the back of your head. If you wanted to kill yourself on the job specifically to get the benefits to your family, there are a million other easier ways to do this than to concoct this incredible scene here. What's at stake here is Nicole Suiter and her family and this man's legacy. What's at stake here is maybe their benefits, which could total a half a million dollars. What's at stake here is how this man is remembered. - It just don't make sense. He had no reason. He wasn't involved in anything. Tell me he was involved in something. The only thing Sean probably guilty of is knowing that his partners was dirty and didn't turn 'em in. If he's guilty of anything, that's the only thing he's guilty of. I'm not angry at the police department. I just want justice for my husband. I don't think I'll be able to get that with a lot of anger in my heart. - People are still, still working the case. Like I said, I stay away from it because of how close I am. What's up, player? I was good this morning, you know? Just interesting because this case right here that I'm on out here for is a case we were working on together, you know? Damn, I wasn't trying even to... Come on, man. [chuckles] All right, champ, get me together. Let's get this going. All right. [sniffles] Sorry about that. All right, so, yeah... it's kind of rough. [uneasy music] ♪ ♪ - I want to go where he was killed, so the community down there can remember Sean. I want it to resurface so his killing don't go in vain. - In a quarter mile, make a right turn. [sirens wail] ♪ ♪ - Waking up this morning was kind of hard. Getting myself together was kind of hard. Just reopening wounds all over again. Doesn't seem like it's been a year, though. - That day, we were going to go out together. I didn't know that he was set to testify at the grand jury in this GTTF shit, and some people were like, "Well, you're his partner. Why wouldn't he tell you?" That's something that he had to deal with. I didn't know about it. I didn't know. - My husband was never a coward to commit suicide. Let's just say that Sean, if he was involved in something, which he wasn't, he's going to take his punishment like a man. - Being there that day at the vigil, it was a strange feeling because it was no feeling. It hurt for so long that it just... the pain couldn't be any more. - Sean is all right. Sean has made that journey that we all have to make. - [sobbing] - Brian unveils new information tonight that Suiter's attorneys say further discredits the suicide theory. - This is Sean Suiter. Taken just days before a review board says he killed himself. The last intimate moment Nicole and her husband shared. She texted this video to him an hour before he was shot on November 15th last year. He called, they laughed, he said he would stay up for her when she got home from her night shift. The main theory of this independent review board is that the day Sean killed himself, he chose a junior homicide detective. I guess the implication is that he wouldn't know what Sean was doing. That was their theory. - Did it sound like they were coming from up? - It sounded like it came just from the alley. That corner... it's all T'd off. It was vibrating back and forth. I didn't see the shooter. I didn't hear any cars. I didn't see any cars speed off. I didn't see anybody run. - I come to find out that it wasn't Sean's case that they were on the street for. It was that junior detective's case, and there's paperwork to that effect. In fact, it was David Bomenka who had the more active case on that block. It partly relied on the witness testimony of a woman in the 900 block of Bennett Place. The documents show she was located on the morning Suiter was shot but refused to cooperate with the homicide operations team dispatched to bring her in. Sources close to the investigation say Detective Bomenka was then ordered to return to the block later that day and convince the witness himself and that Sean Suiter was simply the only other detective available to go with him. - "Take Suiter with you," because Sean was the only guy on the floor. That's what sources have told me, and I've confirmed that three or four different times, which questions the IRB's conclusion that Suiter pushed to go out there that day and work with a rookie cop in order to kill himself. [keys clacking] - It's a big sticking point for Suiter's supporters that, you know, the IRB got it wrong. It discredits the IRB's work in that regard. I don't know that the whole theory disintegrates. - In concluding Sean Suiter took his own life, an independent review board cited the lack of evidence of a second person through DNA testing or fingerprints. Now we've learned there is DNA evidence that could suggest a second person. It was found on Suiter's gun, according to a source familiar with the investigation, and does not belong to Suiter. But it is not traceable. It has not been linked to a specific person. - All of these different reporters, you know, "Suiter's DNA is here and there. There's another DNA. There's no DNA." There's no, you know, whatever. And all of the information coming from the police makes perfect sense if your department's not full of liars. - Hey, is there anything going down that I should know about? Yeah. Yes, really? Okay, can you fill me in so I'm not behind the 8 ball? Fuck, I had no idea how to confirm that. Hmm. [sighs] There's going to be a big report tonight. Before you got here, our former police commissioner pleading guilty, and now this is going on. - It remains one of the biggest open wounds from last year's record-setting violent-crime rate... the death of homicide Detective Sean Suiter, shrouded in mystery, a litany of unanswered questions. Tonight this is at least one of the leads police gathered in the weeks after his shooting. This is an interview inside the Baltimore Police Department's Homicide Section on December 8, 2017. The man being interviewed is Donte Pauling, picked up on a gun possession charge three weeks after the death of homicide detective Sean Suiter. - This is a hard-core leak. - Pauling tells these officers he heard what happened to Sean Suiter and began detailing how he knew the guy who knew how it happened. This is the video released by the independent review board this summer. That is Suiter behind the van. The IRB used this video as evidence to say he was pacing, working up the courage to jump into the alley and shoot himself. But Pauling is now telling detectives this is when Suiter decided to run into the alley to confront a suspect leaning over his drug stash, gun drawn in plain clothes. Pauling never did get the man's name who allegedly overpowered Suiter and killed him with his own service weapon. - We still didn't even know it was an officer yet... - What is unclear is what ever came of this tip. It is important to note that the IRB report says police ran down 54 tips and that "all leads were exhausted," but the report does not mention this lead specifically. - All right, I got to make a phone call. Tell me why this wasn't a credible tip so I can offer another side of the story. I'm like, you can't "no comment" this. People are gonna... people are so distrusting. You've got to say something.

I know Sean Suiter had warned Gondo and Rayam about working with Wayne Jenkins. That means he knows Jenkins is dirty. If you telling Gondo and you telling Rayam, "Yo, look out for Jenkins. Watch him. He up to something," right? But you don't really say nothing to the powers that be, then you a part of the problem, straight up. One of the questions that I get hit with a lot is the amount of Black police officers we have and the amount of Black politicians. The problem is the system is racist. The people are pawns. We knew this for years. You know, even when, like, some other publications write about them, they still think that it's maybe, like, a handful, but it's more than a handful, it's large groups, because it's a tradition in America for police officers to treat Black people a certain kind of way... devilish, evil, steal, oppress, anger, aggression, bullshit. It's what they do, so, like, we know this. So we know it's not over yet. - I never intended to do anything that could not stand up to scrutiny. - Number 51 is on the books. [applause] Bernard C.

It means all of the work and the time it takes for you to move the ball forward just an inch. - In the news tonight, The Baltimore City Police Department says the case is closed. Detective Sean Suiter killed himself two years ago in Harlem Park. - It was a statement few saw coming, brief and with no context, issued by the city police commissioner. Case closed. - If the commissioner thought he was putting an end to all this with his statement yesterday, he did anything but. - I just want to know how many times y'all gonna kill my husband? This is an embarrassment to our family, his friends. We ready for war. Like my lawyer said, we ready for war. - If that's how they want it, then they better be ready. - We're not wearing these shirts for nothing. - Baltimore's top prosecutor says this case is not over. - With all open and pending matters, I cannot ethically comment on them. - The State's Attorney's office did not respond to our question about what they may be pursuing. - So open and pending meaning there is an investigation by your office. - It is an open and pending matter. - That was all the State's Attorney would say today, but for its part, the office of the chief medical examiner says Suiter's death does remain a homicide. - The chief medical examiner said that he had some real concerns about the case. He noted the fact that the casings couldn't definitively be linked to the gun, just that they were the same type of gun. He said it just wasn't good enough, but the biggest thing for him was that Suiter had gone through their training on how to tell the difference between a homicide and a suicide. Shooting yourself in the head, Suiter would have known that's a clear sign that someone shot themselves and that he wouldn't have done it that way. He would have shot himself in the chest because that is less likely to appear as a suicide. So the chief medical examiner felt as though the way he did it was, in some ways, too obvious of a suicide to be a suicide. all: Give us the shooter... - For Sean Suiter! all: Give us the shooter... - For Sean Suiter! all: Give us the shooter... - For Sean Suiter! all: Give us the shooter... - For Sean Suiter! all: Give us the shooter... - For Sean Suiter! all: Give us the shooter... - For Sean Suiter! - My husband did not kill himself.
