No peeking. -How can I peek? -You're right. This way. You can look now. Hey! Naughty girl! Silly. Happy anniversary. So it's been one year. -Really? Where? -Want to know what it is? Yes. Where is it? Where? Close your eyes first. I'll do it for you. I also have something for you. -Can I look now? -Yes, you can. -Are you going to look or not? -Yes. So cute! You got it made? Yeah. You can open it up too. Really? Hey! Don't open it now. It's just... there's a letter inside... that I want you to read... on the day you no longer love me. Why are you saying that stuff? Bear with me. In case one day you feel unsure if you want to leave or stay. Then, open it. It might change your mind. Remember this... That day will never come. Oh, about the internship? I've applied to so many places, mom. Just waiting for them to get back. I'm waiting on a couple of places. Mom, can you hold for a second? The Phuket one is calling. So you want me to be your intern? You only want one? Then I'm sorry but I can't. My mom won't allow me to go out of town alone. Okay. They'll only take me, so I didn't want to go. No! I'm not just waiting for Kim. I'm also waiting for Pey. Dear gods, please let there be a place that will take all three of us. Kim. Why are you making a cake? I'm in a good mood today. Are you tired? Not anymore. Oh, we're not going to Phuket anymore. They only wanted me, so I'm not going. Man, what a shame. Didn't you want to go there? Why didn't you accept it? Because you and Pey won't be going. We've all agreed we have to go together. I'm going to make a wish. There are only a couple of places left. I'm worried that we won't be together. -Pie. -Hm? No. I don't want to talk anymore. Hug me. You're going to get it. You're going to get it! Pie... get what? Get this icing on your face. I can take an internship anywhere, but I want my supervisors to be dark and tough. I hope all your supervisors are transvestites or females. Be quiet. Yes, it's me. Really? Sorry, but can you please repeat the names? All three please. Okay. Then I'll report there before next week. You're so awesome. Okay. Thank you so much. Bye. Pey! Kim! The three of us can all go together! Pie... It's just that I... Here it is! Here comes the barbecue! This is for the one who got what she wanted in Nan Province. I blinked just once and you're all interns. Oh yeah. Kim, I have a friend in Nan. You should go ahead and I'll follow you there in a bit. They say the tribe girls in Nan have really fair skin... Where, Auntie Inn? Nan. Nana... Nana! -Nana. -Nana. Shit. Nana. Nana! Nanas everywhere. Everyone's a nana. Nana! Nana! -Pie... -We need to talk. So nearly a month... that you've been lying to me. Well, there was no chance to tell you. Really? Tell me, Kim, why do you want to be away from me? Well? This is crazy, Pie. I don't want to be away from you. I just want to go where I want. Where it benefits Papa's vineyard. Pie, this is my future! A future that you don't want me in. I bet you'll charm all the girls. -Then someone will fancy you. -What is this, Pie? Don't be ridiculous! Ridiculous? I'm ridiculous for wanting to be close to you? -If that's what you think, then we-- -What? Then we what? Didn't I tell you that no matter what happens, don't ever say that. Don't say it when you're emotional. Pie... Come on. We'll be apart for just a few months. It's really not a big deal. We have phones. We have holidays. I can come visit you... or you can come visit me. Come on. Please don't be childish. Childish? I'm childish? I'm sorry, Kim... but is being secretive a grown up thing to do? Pie! Where are you going, Pie? Come back. No. I'm going home. This again. You always go home when this happens. Is it because I can't go there? Okay. You can do that. But I'll be gone in two days. Can you come, send me off? Please? Don't be childish, Kim. Just a few months apart won't hurt. Papa, she's got it really bad. You'd better tell her to leave now. Tiger, listen... You'd better go now before it gets dark. Just a bit longer, Papa. Let me tell you, girls can't sulk forever. If you're persistent enough to try all the way from here to Nan, I bet she'll forgive you. -Let's go. -From here to Nan? I've been calling her for two days. She hasn't answered my calls. How about this? Just find a new girl. Trust me. As soon as you do, she'll call. Trust me. That's how women are. -Is this from experience? -No, sir. I learned from you, sir. Let's go. Stop the car! Pie. Got your migraine pills? Eye mask? Coat? Stinky blanket? Five fingered socks? I know you definitely don't have one of these. Are you still mad at me? I stayed up all night making this. I was so tired. I love you. Take care of yourself, Pie. Kim... Go on, Kim. I'll be fine. People are watching. Kim, I'll say hi to Brutus and tell him to take care of you. No way, Papa! They'll think I'm privileged. NO ENTRY Hello. I'm the intern. Is Brutus here? Come here. You're Kim? -Yes. -Come sit down. As soon as you called me Brutus, I knew whose kid you were. But you can call me Joe when you're here. And that is Su. Hello. Here, we attentively care for resources such as water, soil, rice, tea, and coffee. Therefore, you must take excellent care of the sprouts field. Never neglect them. Who are you, hooded person? Easy on the fertilizer. -It might become resistant. -Okay, Joe. Oh, I wondered who you were. This is Kim. She's the new intern. Hello, Miss. The day I've been waiting for has arrived. I would like to officially welcome both of you into this internship. The two of you are the fourth generation of interns. I believe that you both love the sky, the water, and the Nemo fish like I do. Pie... and Pey. We have two more helpers here. They've been coming here so often they're almost full-time. This is March. This is April. Get acquainted. -Hello. -Hello. -Hello. -Hello. And are you guys siblings? No, we're not. No, she's my neighbor. Then why are your names March and April? -Well-- -It's this. My mom and her mom are best friends. I'm Duang, at your service. You can ask me anything. I'm just a handsome and smooth kind of guy. Pie. We finally got to meet each other. Yeah. Thank you. You can call on us for anything. We're both very tough. Really? Is that true? Especially me. The two of you are very lucky. Duang hasn't ordered a special meal like this in a very long time. I'm making the effort for Pie. Vegetables... Looks yummy, right? Well, I'm a vegetarian, so I don't like eating meat. Aren't I a good person? Well, we're carnivores. Pey, don't get him started. Vegetables are good. They are good for our health. Correct, Pie. I knew it. I chose the right person to love. I'm blushing. Now what? Now you've done it. Let's eat. Are you okay? I slipped. Welcome for the second time. -Second time? -We've already met. Don't you remember? You look really dirty. Go, have a wash. Oh, I look dirty... Oh, my name is Kim. Mhmm. Just go. Hurry. There's no service here. You have to go to the entrance. You can go after dinner. It's not far. Let's eat. Welcome. Thanks. -My name is Jam. -So... is this one a veggie stir-fry? Salad, clear dressing. And... is this oven-baked pork? Steak. I'm hungry now. Can I eat? Is it delicious? Liar! I'll give you another chance. Is it really delicious? Nope. Next time, let me handle the food. Okay. Please take good care of me. -Let's go transport the veggies. -It's still dark. It's not dark. It's dawn. -Yongkao! -What? Come on! Trapor. Trapor. -Trapor? -Trapor. Oh, transport. Su, you need to pronounce it right. Read my lips. "Transport." Wow, Jam. Your outfit is cute today. Thanks. This is Kim, the intern from Bangkok. Hi. Hey, Jam. Last night, I requested a radio song for you. The DJ asked, "Who is this song for?" I said, "For the one." For the one, from the shorty? Kim, Jam, ignore her. Help me with the vegetables. Wait. Just spit it out. Are you a tomboy? No. I'm a woman. Are you sure? Yeah. But I'm a woman who's into... women. I knew it. -Hello. How's the business? -Business is good. Come on, Kim. There's a kitten here! This is the most respected temple in Nan Province.. It used to be called Prommin Temple. It was built 400 years ago. You know why this temple is special? The chapel and temple are next to each other. And the murals here are very unique in how they were drawn and painted. Look here. This mural is very famous. It's called "Love Whispering." Love Whispering? Oh, they also have a poem for it. "This love of mine, should I place it in the water, I fear it may shiver. Should I place it in the sky, I fear the clouds would cover it. Should I place it in a castle, I fear the king would take it. I shall place it in my heart for always." Wow. So do you want to be an agricultural officer or a local guide? Man, I was just being nice and telling you a lot of stories. Nice scarf. I bet it would look better on me. -Dream on. -I'm not. -Su, Nan, good night. -Good night. If you want to call someone, there's a service signal here. Hey, wait. Keep me company. Why? Afraid of ghosts? It's dark and I'm still learning my way around. Okay. Then hurry up. The mosquitos here are vicious. Okay. Thanks. Hello. Pie. Can you hear me, Pie? Hello, Kim. How is everything? I couldn't reach you at all. Why are you only calling me now? I waited all day. I was training all day. And my house has no service. I came all the way here to call you. It's dark here, Pie. Is the house scary? Is it suitable? Who are you staying with? It's not scary at all, Pie. I'm living with another intern. She's a woman. What does she look like? Is she cute? Does she know you have a girlfriend? You can trust me one million percent. How about I call you every night at eight? No way... We'll have time to finish work. Fine... Then... message me during the day? If we're free, we can chat. Okay? I miss you. Same here. Sweet dreams. -I love you. -Yup. Okay. Thanks, Jam. I WHISPER... I LOVE YOU KIM Zero. Yeah. Zero. -Are you tired? -A bit, but it's okay. If you're hot, there's AC in the office. They say... "If you're hot, turn on the AC, but if you want someone to care for you, open your heart." Think about it. Help me. Endure, lady. All you can do is endure. Duang. His name is Duang. Is he handsome? Is he hitting on you? Obviously. I'm gorgeous. But I don't want him. I'm already taken. We have to eat only veggies every day. I'm going to turn into a vegetable. Oh, I'm not tired. I just miss you. Today, we have stir-fried morning glory. Pey is now heartbroken. Acting a bit hurt. The fifth time in a month and a half! If you want some, come visit me. I'll make you two pots. Don't challenge me. You'll be sorry if I show up. When we've finished our internships. Just a bit longer, okay? Pie, look at the moon. I'm looking. If we're looking at the same moon... then we're not that far apart, Pie. Can you handle it? Need a hand? It's okay. I can handle it. But your face is pale. Come and eat something. In a bit. Here. Feed me. Here, there's lots. Feed me, too. Your hands aren't dirty. Feed yourself. Now it's dirty. Feed me, please? Yongkao, you're funny, huh? Kao! I've been looking for you. Why are you here? What? Get back to work. Go on. Here, eat some hay. Kim, why did you choose to study agriculture? My family has a vineyard. I want to help and improve it. And personally, I like the subject. How about you? Me? I was actually born in Bangkok. I moved to Chiang Mai with my dad at seven. He's an agricultural officer. As a kid I enjoyed the woods with my dad and sister. My sister's name is Butter. My dad's name is Bread, and I'm Jam. So we're the pastry family. Cute, right? When I had to choose my major in high school, at first I though a pretty girl like me should be a flight attendant or something. But when I saw the villagers thank my dad for bringing them sprouts, I wanted to be just like him. He is my hero. I just want agriculture. When he found out I chose agriculture, he complained all day. He thinks a girl like me shouldn't be in rough weather. But I'm not scared, because I know I'm a tough cookie. Nan is my favorite province. I feel that the community, the culture, and the nature are all in perfect harmony. When I found out that I had to do an internship, this place was my first choice. When I was a freshman, my friend, Turbo, ordered peanut butter sandwich. I didn't know what it was at first, but once I tried it, so delicious! I've eaten peanut butter sandwiches every day ever since. And what do you like? I like jam. Especially the grape jam from my home. So delicious. Don't believe me? Try some. Your story's over? Yeah. It's over. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. I'll explain some more. No. You were very detailed. It's nine! I had a lot of work today, Pie. And I was very tired, so I rested for a bit before calling you. I'm as tired as you are! I had work too! Plus, I had to wait for you. Next time, if you're not sure you can call me at eight, don't promise. I'm sorry. It's my fault, Pie. I really was working, Pie. Don't be mad at me. Have you eaten anything? Not yet, Pie. I haven't had anything to eat. I'm so hungry, Pie. Are you very tired? I'm so tired. Super tired, but your voice made it all go away. Are we good now? Then smile. Are you smiling? Yes. I don't believe you. I bet that right now, you're pouting so hard, you look like a duck. Not true! Not true at all! Do you love me? Yes. So much. Pie, I gotta go. Why? That wasn't long. I still miss you. I need to go into the woods before dawn tomorrow. Call you tomorrow night at eight sharp? Okay? Bye-bye. Jam... I'm sorry for bothering you every night. There are a lot of mosquitoes. I'm also sleepy. Okay, let's go home then. Wait, Jam. Just a second. I CAN TRUST YOUR LOVE FOR ME, RIGHT? Pie. Yes, you can. One hundred percent. One million percent. Get some rest, Pie. I love you. Um, hello? I'm losing you. Kim... How are you, Kim? -I'm good. -Okay. So, Kim, Jam, we're camping in the woods tonight, so we can start early tomorrow. Su, help me collect aerides rosea samples. Okay. -No service? -No. Not very strong. Girlfriend? Yes. First love? Yeah. Have you been together long? Three years. That's a long time. Tell me about what makes you love her. No way. I'd die of embarrassment. Come on. Pie likes to beg me like a little puppy. She likes me to stroke her hair before bedtime every night. Some nights, I would stroke her hair until almost dawn and nearly missed my exam. She's a clean freak. She'll know right away if there's even one grain of dust, so I have to mop our room morning, noon, and night. She's not a picky eater. She eats everything I cook. I was sleeping, and suddenly she woke me up to cook her some food. She loves my cooking, but I can't be loud. Whenever I want to listen to music or play games, I have to wear headphones, so she won't get upset. Is she easily upset? Yes. But she's fine after she's eaten chocolate cake. Sometimes, after we fought, I've had to go out and buy it for her, no matter what. What about when you're angry or upset? What does she do for you? She gives me my space and won't bother me at all. Oh. How's that? I'm easy-going. All I need is a glass of warm milk. You think... all these are good things? Mm. Yeah. When I make her happy, I'm happy. I'm... going to bed. I'm tired. You can't do that, March, or it won't heal. It's okay. Don't do it. Just a little bit. How about you look over there and count the fish. I don't see any. Oh, there are two. All done. See? That didn't hurt at all. What happened, March? Bike accident. Let me see. Are you hurt? The dogs like to chase my bike, so I had an accident. She's a scaredy cat. How can a girl this big be afraid of dogs? Ride home yourself. I'm going. What? But you said you'd give me a ride. Are you nuts? Who said I'd give you a ride? April, give March a ride, okay? She's hurt pretty badly. She can't ride. Fine. Sure. Bye. April, wait for me. I knew it. What's up, Pie? I know March and April's secret. Which is... That the two of them... are an item. What's wrong with you, Pie? The entire universe already knows about March and April. What? How did they know? They hide it well. They don't. April might, but March... is open about it. You're not familiar with this? With what? Well, that it's what you do with Kimhan. Boy! It's Pey. Pey! Pey... What do you want, ladyboy? I'm no ladyboy. I'm a tomboy. Kim! Are you a tomboy now? I'm heartbroken. Got a haircut because my girlfriend doesn't love me. Really? Your girlfriend doesn't love you? Let me see my girlfriend's true face. Let me see my girlfriend with long hair. -No way. -Come on. No way. I don't like it. Stay still. Here. Whose girlfriend are you? You're a cutie! My lovely Pie... Who is she? Oh, this is Kim, the one I said was going to come here too. And why didn't you come? Hello. I'm Duang. At your service. -Hello. -Hello, hello. There are very few of us here. We're so lonely. I was going to post, "Single on the outside, lonely on the inside, every day is sad." I've got it. Pie. Call March. Tell her to prepare a feast today. Bigger than yours! Give me a moment. Kimhan Buranapun. Agriculture major! Hey, what are you doing, Kim? Don't take it off. It's quite cute. In this wig? Are you kidding me? Why? I think it's cute. Really, it's cute. Come on. Wear it for me. Just for me, okay? I can do everything for you, but why do you have to force me on this? Because people have seen you with long hair. It'd be weird to take it off now. Of course it'd be weird. It's already weird... for my girlfriend to put a wig on me to keep up her image! This again. Is it not true? How often have you tried to make me grow my hair? Have you ever done it though? You're forceful, Pie. Don't love me then. Hello, dear Kim. I just took a peek at your application. I saw that you're an agriculture major, right? So, for this evening's party... I will find something special for you. Just for you, Kim. What do you want, tell me. Come on. Tell me. I'll get it for you. Sea shells. Kim loves sea shells, especially rare ones. Right place, right time. Okay! Let's go, April. They're full now. Let's go to that pond. I got a ride with Aek because I had a lot of stuff. You know everyone in town. Why must it be Aek? Jealous? Who's jealous? What are we exactly? Why should I be jealous, huh, lady? What did you just say? I can't take this anymore. Me neither! April! How is she doing? Kim, are you okay? Just having a migraine. Can you head home? I'll catch up. She's still in a bad way. Happy birthday to you... Happy birthday, my child. -I hope you're happy, tiger. -Thanks, Papa. I hope you have lots of hot, sexy girlfriends. Don't bud in just yet. I'm not done with the birthday wishes. Hey, Kim. On your birthday, I want to let you know that I'm very happy to have a daughter like you. I love you. I love you too, Papa. THIS IS MY NUMBER. AT YOUR SERVICE. Happy birthday, Kim. Checking social media this early? What Pey said is probably true... Girls with long hair are pretty hot. Was that your lover who messaged you? Pie. Stop playing around. It's not funny. Aha... if you're using that tone then I must be right. Stop joking around with me like this, you hear me? Kim... When will you care about how other people feel or think? Hey, what's the matter with you? What did I do wrong? What did you do wrong? What was yesterday? Can you remember? Of course. And? So you just went and did what you did yesterday! What are you doing? Don't pack your things on me! I don't like it! Kim, this has gone too far! If you're going to pack and leave like this... we should breakup. You've finally said it, Pie. The number you have dialed cannot be reached at this time. NO ENTRY WITHOUT PERMISSION Did you get an electric shock? Cool, right? I did it all by myself. Then I'll treat you to a big meal. No need. I just wanted to do it. You don't need to repay me. It's enough not to have to listen to your calls every day. Want to skip work tomorrow? Really? And... will Joe and Su find out? What do I do? Then we must leave before dawn. Okay, sure. We'll leave at 5 a.m. We're here. The coffee here is amazing. How do I look? This is cute. -What's this one? -Spicy chicken soup. PIE Hello. Kim... Er, she's sleeping right now. She's sick with a migraine. Oh, okay. Please let her know that Pie called. Excuse me... Who... are you? It's Jam. I'll let her know. Good bye. Kim, meet me at my office. Now. Okay. I signed for it. I was taking it to you. That's how I knew you were gone. Why did you skip work? If you have important business, just tell me, so I'll know that I have to take care of the spouts. I'm sorry. Don't think that you can do this because I know your dad and aunt. -I didn't think that. -Then what? You and Jam went into town. I... Almost all of the sprouts in your field died. If you know you're this lazy and spend your days gallivanting, why don't you just go work in your dad's vineyard? Better yet, go take care of his resort. No need to come here to grind. I'm sorry. Give me another chance. It's fine if you don't sign off my internship. I just want another chance. Kim. Drink this so you feel better. You don't want it? Kim... -Who did this to you, Auntie Inn? -No one did. Auntie Inn, have some rice soup so you get back your energy. Are you tired? You drove here from Bangkok? Eat some, Auntie Inn. No. I'm not hungry. Auntie Inn, what's wrong? -Who hurt you? -No one. I was the one who hurt them. I found someone I liked, so I gave it a shot. And... And... and I gave him my whole heart. And... And his wife showed up. Auntie Inn... Kim... Can I stay here for a while? Why won't they just die? Darn caterpillars. Just let them be. There aren't many. Think of it as preserving the ecosystem. Why should I let them be? This is me, not the nice Kim who allowed their army to take over the whole field. -These are mountain snacks, Auntie Inn. -Thanks. -I like to have them with coffee. -Yummy. Let me try some. Which mountain tribes? Delicious. Oh yeah, Jam. I've been here a few days already but I haven't seen Kim take a lunch break. -Joe chewed her out the other day. -What for? She skipped work to visit her girlfriend. What? All the way to Chanthaburi? If her dad finds out about this... It's my fault, Auntie Inn. If on that day... I'd been home to pick up that package, Joe wouldn't have found out that she skipped. Don't cover up for each other with things like these. Kim is a charming person. Do you also fancy her? I'm not hoping for anything. I'm just... happy... when I'm near her... and when I do things for her. I just want to see her happy. You didn't answer my question. That means you do. Do you know... why I came here? When we love someone... who's already taken, it's very painful. And when we know how much they love each other, it hurts even more. The pain will be even greater if we choose to be the other woman. We have to hide our feelings, and wait for them to see that we are here. Am I so wrong? The fault is with the timing; for making us meet them too late. The fault is with time... but the pain is with us. I haven't seen March lately. When you neglect March like this, aren't you scared of losing her? I work this hard just for her. Once it's all over, I think she'll understand. What if... she finds someone else? Problems between two people aren't scary at all. But if there's a third party then they are. You two are on your own tonight. I'm going out with Brutus. We're going to get drunk. Don't drink too much. You know it's bad for you, right? And be home by 2 a.m., understand? When the hell did my mother possess you? She's not even dead yet. -Are you wishing death upon granny? -No, I wasn't. Wrong again. Do it like this. Hello, Auntie Inn. Oh, hello! Sorry I didn't call ahead. I couldn't reach you. I was just busy working a lot. Are you tired? -A bit. -I'll put your bags away for you. -Oh, are you hungry, Pie? -It's okay. Er, Pie, this is Jam. Er, Jam, -this is Pie. -Kim's girlfriend. Come here, Pie. We're making floating baskets. You came in time for Loi Krathong Festival. Loi Loi Krathong. Loi Loi Krathong. Join us. We have lots. It's okay. I'll wait for Kim. -Then I'll go pick some more flowers. -Okay. Can I come with you? Sure, come on. Don't be too rough. I mean, be careful. Take it easy. Pick them slowly. There's going to be a bloodbath. Is the internship here fun? Yeah, it's fun. I like Nan, the forests, and the mountains. I'm just like any agriculture major student. What do you like? I'm a fishery major. I like the sea. Curious... Kim likes the mountains, and you like the sea. What a mismatch. -Where did they go, Auntie Inn? -They're cat fighting down there! No, no, no, no. Where are you going? Stop it. They'll kill you. -What should I do? -Too late. The bomb has dropped. Boom! When it's this obvious, it's better to let them handle it. You need to wait and see how it all turns out first. Then you can say something. Trust me. Trust me. How is there another one? Hey, what are you doing? That'll turn into a butterfly. But we don't want butterflies here. Why? What's wrong with butterflies? Well, this is an agricultural field. It's not good to have them. I just pity them for what you did. Caterpillars just want to be butterflies. I don't care. They're eating the plants that I carefully grew. I think you did the right thing. Because some caterpillars deserve to be squashed like that. How dare they eat the plants that other people grew? They've spent a lot of time and energy on it. You did the right thing. Pie, do you like the Northern Loi Kratong Festival? -Isn't it pretty? -Mm. Jam, that's a pretty outfit. Oh! Is anyone hungry? Are you okay, Pie? That was loud. My ears hurt now. Kim. -I'm going to go home. -Why? I have a headache, and I'm tired. -You can go by yourself? It's dark out. -Of course I can. I'm not afraid of ghosts like you. You go ahead and show Pie around. After all, she came all this way. Have fun, Pie. Wait, wait, wait. It's dark. Are you sure you can go home alone? Then let's go home. Come on, let's just all go home. How does Jam feel about you? Then... how do you feel about her? You came all this way just to ask about another person? This other person you're talking about is messing with my girl. Who? Who's your girl? Wow, Kim. Weren't you the one who broke up with me? I was being sarcastic, okay? I said it because I was angry. You want to take it that seriously? Why, Kim? What happened to the old Kim? The Kim who always understood me no matter how stupid I was. Try walking in my shoes! So you know the stupid things I had to put up with. I skipped work to go celebrate my birthday with you! What did I get? Did you pay attention to me? I even let you make me wear that stupid wig! Then you gave my number to that guy even though you knew that he'd been harassing me. What for? So people wouldn't find out I'm a tomboy? Are you embarrassed? Are you afraid people will know you're with a tomboy? What if I told you I didn't give Duang your number? And I've never ever forgotten your birthday. See? Here it is. You really don't want to know -what's inside? -I've been busy! Ask yourself for me. If you'd never met Jam, would I be this guilty today? I'm the same. Stupid as always. Self-centered as always. Why is it, all of a sudden everything I do seems wrong? You keep it. I'm not the one who needs it. Are you graduating after this internship? Yes, I just have to wait for the graduation ceremony. Are you doing your Master's now? Probably not. I want to help out at the vineyard first. Okay. Safe trip. Give your dad and auntie my regards. Wait. Give this to Jam for me. Haven't seen her all day. Joe, you know that Jam wants to continue her internship and that she's doing research with us, right? Really? -Okay, that's all fine then. -Okay. Safe trip. Jam. Jam. I'M NOT OLD YET WHAT A CUTE SMILE KIM... KIM... KIM... I CAN REMEMBER NOW KIM ATE ALL THE FOOD I COOKED THOUGHT SHE WAS TOUGH BUT SHE'S SCARED OF GHOSTS, HA HA. WHY DO I FEEL THIS WAY? I GOT TO FEED KIM ONE DAY... I'M SO HAPPY... I WISH IT WOULD NEVER BE EIGHT... SHE HAS A GIRLFRIEND IT HURTS... I REPEAT!! SHE HAS A GIRLFRIEND IS IT WRONG THAT I MISS HER? BECAUSE I WANT TO GIVE... KIM'S BACK. YAY! THANK YOU FOR THINKING OF ME I WISH WE HAD MORE TIME TOGETHER MY FLOATING BASKET IS RIGHT BEHIND KIM'S JAM JAM JAM JAM... THE FAULT IS WITH TIME... BUT THE PAIN IS WITH ME... Since you know now, I would like to say something. You're the first person I've ever loved. No matter what the answer is... please let me know. I'll be waiting. Can I come too? Pork jerky! It's not burnt this time... but it's undercooked. I knew it. Good that I asked Su to buy another one. This one is edible. I don't know what bit me. There's a red bump now. I bet it's going to itch. Kim. What are you thinking of? I've been calling you for a while. Just day dreaming. It's nothing. Can you do it? Here, let me do it. Man, I thought you were strong. Push me up some more. Hey! Sorry. For what? Everything. For choosing to be with me too? I also feel that when we were just friends we seemed happier. I... Go on, Kim. Don't apologize for what you need to do. Who came first isn't important. The important thing is, who do you love? Thank you... for never making me feel uncomfortable. COME BACK I LOVE YOU, KIM Thank you. KISS MY NOSE BEFORE BEDTIME Happy birthday to you... Happy birthday to you... Kim! Have a happy happy birthday! I hope you get everything you wish for. I hope you don't get a migraine. I hope you're not tired of this girlfriend. I know I'm not that good a girlfriend, but from now on, I'll try to be a better, better, better... better person to you. Thank you, Kim. Thank you for loving me. Thank you for putting up with me. I love you. Kiss kiss. Pie, are you going to let her stand in the rain all night? Who, mom? Pie. No one can stand in the rain so long they die of old age, mom. Go home, Kim. This is no use. Can you give me a chance? You had your chance. Mom used to tell me that our kind of love... couldn't last. How could two girls... take care of each other, or get married? I had a dream that I wanted a baby... and a complete family, but I didn't care. I chose you. Then one day you stopped loving me... and disappeared without a trace. I never stopped loving you. Where were you on the day I nearly cried myself to death? How can I know that in the future... you won't hurt me again? What could you do to make me trust... that our love would last? Go home, Kim. Our love has run its course. ONE YEAR LATER Miss Pie? Um... She's in the bathroom. She's always in the bathroom. She has a bad stomach. No! No need to pay her a visit. Okay. I'll get her to call you back once she's better. Okay. Goodbye. You should talk to him sometimes. Nah. It's a waste of my time. I really want to know who will be able to make you say yes. Hello, this is Mindara. Oh, that is not okay. I told you I won't share a booth with anyone. Then have the space manager come talk to me. Any method is fine. (RESERVED) (RESERVED) Here's the reservation receipt. The date is very clear. I booked this on the first day. If there's a mistake with the reservation, let's see who made it first. I'm afraid it was made on the same day. How about this? We will expand the space to double its size, -and-- -Whatever. I just want the same spot. Well, you will have to move a little bit. Then just make the border clear, please. Miss Pie, they've booked this space first. What time did they book it? 11 a.m. Hello, Miss Kimhan. This is Miss Mindara, owner of this booth. Nice to meet you. Then the both of you can talk this out. I'll go get the staff to come help set up the space. You go ahead and discuss it with the staff. Okay. Long time no see. You've gotten prettier. -Thanks. -Papa says he misses you everyday. You've also gotten girlier. Nice long hair. My girlfriend wanted me to. My girlfriend is really cute but she's super mean. Irritable, bossy, but I really love her. I must be a masochist. Why are you telling me about your girlfriend? Whatever. Who you grow out your hair for is none of my business. Stop. Don't cross that line. Marry me, Pie. Are you nuts, Kim? What a silly thought! I'm serious, Pie. The whole year I've been gone, I haven't given up. There's nothing about you that I don't know. You drink warm milk when you're upset. You look at your phone every night at eight. I've been thinking everyday about what you said. I grew out my hair just as you wanted in case we run into each other like today, so you'll see that I did this for you. And I have one more thing to tell you... Why does our kind of love need to end up in legal marriage? Why do we need to have children to ensure we stay together? When in reality, married people with children still break up left, right and center. I was wrong in the past... I know it. But from now on, I'll make it better. I will spend my whole life convincing you... that I love you very much... so much, I don't know if I could love anyone else in this life. If we still love each other, let's start over. Don't assume... I didn't say you could hug me. Just a bit longer. I miss you. Now that you're back, I'm not letting you go anywhere again. So? Do you like it? Here. If you feel unsure if you want to stay or leave, you can open it. It might change your mind What does it say? "Die." That day won't come, Pie. Let me see. It's a sassy look.
