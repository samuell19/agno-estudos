Well, the talent show is at 8:00 p.m. - So, no, not really. - Yeah. What are you going to do this fine Christmas Eve? I was potentially going to go meet up with a dude, but I don't know. - A dude, a man. - Yep. Okay, on Christmas Eve, you're going to invite a stranger to your house. Uh, a stranger to Reggie's, yeah. Okay, cool. Fuck, they're still open. Did you meet him organically, or is this, like, a tinder sort of scenario? - Tinder situation, yeah. - Oh, Tinder, okay. - Yeah. - Can I see him? - Eh. - Eh. He must be a fucking stud. What the fuck else am I supposed to do? You want me to go home, drink some whiskey, sit by the fire by my lonesome, watch "A Christmas Story" like every other fucking douchebag in America? Yeah. Sounds kind of nice. Or you to go to drink some whiskey with me. Uh, that Lahna's Christmas gift. - Is it? - So you can put a fuckin'... - No longer. - What the fuck are you doing? So, fuck no. I wanted to do that, too. So hand me some cups, and let's go. Are you gonna go see your pops up north tomorrow? - Yeah. - You should probably get - a head start late tonight. - No. Fuck that. One day, in and out, is my rule. I can't see anything wrong in that. - Fair enough. - Mazel tov. Mazel tov. Cheers, motherfucker. Only quit stalling. Show me Tommy Tinder. What the fuck is your obsession with this? - I want to see him. - I don't want to - show him to you. - Is he big? Is he a big boy? - Oh. - BBW. - That what you want to know? - Yeah. In that case, I'll fuckin' show you. Here. What? I didn't know you knew Emmett Eyeliner. Emmett Eyeliner. Why are you calling him that? - Do you know him? - I know of him. Did he tell you he got, like, three kids? Wait four. Someone's pregnant now, I think. - Oh, fuck! He's got kids? - Yeah. I don't fucking care. I just want a little Christmas Eve schlong. Well, dude's a genic jackhammer. - Oh, Jesus. - Little, uh, sperm canon, all I'm saying. Okay, I'm happy you told me that, so I'll wear my dental dam and get fucking sauced before he shows up. Thank you. That's so sweet of you. Well, I'll tell you what. I can go to Reggie's with you because, um, I don't really have shit to do. Robbie, that's very, very sweet of you, but I want to get laid. Not wax poetic with the regulars. Well, seeing as you didn't buy me a Christmas present this year, I'm going to take this. - Oh. - Thank you. And you can enjoy your, what, two hours of unbearable conversation, your 7 seconds of lame sex. You go home, probably, you know, get yourself off anyway. Or, I'm just throwing this out there, you can have two hours of amazing, vivacious, sort of hauntingly erotic conversation. - Hauntingly erotic? - Hauntingly erotic? And you can go home anyway. You know, get yourself off, like, flick your little bean. - Oh? - Yeah. And you don't have to wake up next to 30 Seconds To Mars. All right, well, I've got a proposition for you. How about you give me back my fucking whiskey and stop talking about me flicking at my fucking bean? - Okay. - How about that? Have you confirmed with him? No, I have not given him a time. Poor guy. It's kind of sad. He's probably at home scrolling through your social media, fingers sweaty, hand firmly on cock, just... beating that meat, waiting for your text to pop up at the top. Mm. I've blown off twice already, so. - Third time's a charm. - Yeah. Come on, get a drink with your old pal Robbie. It's my long time employee Robbie. - That's a little bit harsh. - It's true. I own you. - You own me? - You're on my payroll. Yeah. Mama. Okay. Okay. Okay. I'm going to change your mind. Have you heard his music? - I have not bothered, no. - Oh, that answers a lot. Why? What you got? I'll show you something Something fun. Hmm. All right. Ready? I'm losing interest already. Come on. Alright, you'll see. Hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on. What? - Oh, my God. - Soothing. Shut the fuck up. Why is he whisper singing? Doesn't want to wake his parents, probably. What the fuck? Turn that off. Why are you showing that to me? Stop. Well, you know, it's not like you're going to saddle up with the son of a bitch. I mean, you should probably let the guy go back to his family and his kids. He's a daddy, after all. - Daddy? - Yeah. Little Tommy Tinder. Well... All right. Let's go get shit faced. But you're not getting anything either. So if you want to go flick your fucking bean, do what you need to do. - Come on. - All right. - Turn off the music. - Well, considering you were gonna saddle up with old Emmett Eyeliner, I'm not sure how I should feel about that. Well, I don't work with them Emmett Eyeliner, do I? Well, I am better looking in that douche, though, right? Do you want to fucking die? Get your fucking grubby shoes off the counter. Kill the music before I change my mind. - Should I meet you there or? - No, We're going to walk. - Well, it's fucking snowing out. - Oh, my God. That's so scary! Come on. Get those chicken legs out. Let's go for a walk. I got to bring this to Lahna. Why? They close at 6:00. They're not going to be open. No, they'll still be there. They're having a little Christmas Eve Fuckfest. What the hell, Why? You don't want to fuck in a toy store? No. Well, mm, maybe. I mean... Sounds like you don't want to fuck in a toy store. It's just kind of weird. Like, I feel sorry for the kid that's going to go in tomorrow, buy a teddy bear covered - in fucking cum. - Oh, my God. We're going to scar him. That poor child. Come on. Lock up behind you. We could have taken my car. Would have been a smart option. Do you want to keep keep complaining? Or do you want to just walk in silence? - What do you want to do? - You're the one who was complaining all day about fucking Christmas this, Christmas that, oh, I fucking hate Christmas. Well, Christmas fucking sucks. Do you not agree that there's no good fucking Christmas music, - no good Christmas movies. - Bad Religion had - a great Christmas album. - Just fucking get it over with. - Eh. - It was good. There aren't many albums that give me that spirit of fucking Christmas. Well, Bad fuckin' Religion, ain't it, buddy. Give me that. I would go as far to say there's like fucking two... Two Christmas songs that are good, and that's if you don't count, if and only if, you don't count fucking Crypt Keeper "Christmas Rap." Okay, love "Tales From the Crypt." That song sucks the fucking shit out of my ass. This is coming from a guy who jizzes his fucking pants every single time he hears Buster Poindexter's cover of "Zat You, Santa Claus?" No, no, no, no, no, no. I don't like that cover. I like the version with the commentary from Beavis and Butthead. - Okay. - Okay. "Merry Christmas", Ramones, then. That's mine. What's your big fucking runner up? Uh, sorry to say, but "Merry Christmas", Ramones, that's a fucking runner up. - Yeah. - Fuck you. - First place... - Fuck you. First place is our lord and savior Lemmy with "Run Rudolph Run." Oh, it's magic! Okay. It's not like it's Motorhead. It's Lemmy with the fucking Foo Fighters. - Oh, R.I.P. - Oh, R.I.P. Also Lemmy is fucking Motorhead, you idiot. Yeah. Hey! Lahna! She knows you're coming, right? Yeah, of course she knows I'm fucking coming. Oh. - Hey, bitch. - Hi! Mwah! You look so good. - Thank you. - Hey, gorgeous. - Mwah. - Mwah. I brought you and Jay a little something, something. Ooh, I got you this. Oh, my God. I love you so much. - I missed you. - I missed you, too. Where's Jay? He's in the back, freshening up. You know, he just gets a little musty. He gets a little musty? - You got a lot going on. - Musty she says. Yeah, you know all about that, right? - No, I do. - You know all about that? - Baby. - Yeah. You know all about a little musty must? I got a stinky dick. - That's so fucked up. - Cute, right? - Bitch. - Yeah? You already cracked this open. We may have had, like, like a couple of drinks.

What was his name? Emmett... Emmett... - We don't have to talk... - Emmett! Oh, shit! No, I think we're ignoring that. Motherfuckin' four-kid Emmett. Four kid Emmett? - No. - Nearly five kid Emmett. Four kid Emmett. Why does everybody know Emmett - except for me? - He's got four kids. - All right. Well, cheers. Yeah. - No, no, no. What was the song? What was the song? It was... We don't need the song. ♪ And her heart whispers in my head ♪ - Alright, fuckers. - Go for it, tap on in. ♪ Because she's half dead ♪ - Tori! - No, no, no, no.

Come sit on Santa's lap and tell him what you want for Christmas. Ugh! - I fucking hate that. - No, they all get recalled. Priest said that to me when I was a young boy. Are you okay? You're not fucking okay. - No, I'm not well. - It's so bad. Thank God they're taking it out on Friday. Has he ever come to life while you guys were fucking? Oh, he joins. -Yeah.

Bonkers is now the subject of an international recall. There have been reports that some of the Santa units are reverting to their old Defense Department firmware. Thus far, most of the reports have been of harmless pranks. Fuck no! Larry, can you turn that shit off? - That's so depressing. - Yeah. You guys want one more to close it out? Yeah, we will. Can we get another round and a shot of whiskey, please? You're going to chase a shot of whiskey with more whiskey? I am. It's a holiday. That's what you do. - This is true. - Thank you. Is this, uh, together? Or separate? Togeth... Together. It's on one bill. I got it. - Oh, la di da. - It's part of your bonus. Although I am a little disappointed. He didn't even offer to pay for the fuckin' last... Excuse me, this is not a date, remember? Yeah, no, I fuckin' remember now. Happy I didn't think otherwise. -Fun hangout -Yeah. Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool. You think would have picked up the tab for, uh, Doctor fuckin' Emmett Eyeliner. Depends on how the night went. Probably would have forgotten his wallet or something. Mnh-mnh. Did this dude fuck your mom or something? Why the fuck... every single time you talk about him, I'm like so close to forgetting him, and then you bring him up again. I'm just like, just like, it baffles me that you were going to let him, like, you know, - stick his penis just... - Taint me? - Inside you. - He's gonna fuckin' taint me? - He was gonna taint you. - Yeah, I'm horny, and it's a holiday. What am I supposed to do? Do you want to go through... Larry, do you want to go through Robbie's list of prize catches? - Not again. - 'Cause fuckin'... No, remember this? Remember rotten Rebecca? The one that smelled like a fucking fish market. - Oh, God. - She was great. Yeah, had to walk out of the room every time... - Rotten Rebecca. - Every time she fucking walked in one. Oh, my God. That honestly made me want to throw up. That was so gross. Who else? Come on. Do you want to talk about Tina? - Tina? - Googly eyed Tina? Do you want me to keep going? That's my point. - That was a condition. - Do you want me to keep going? - She couldn't help it. - Okay. - She's a beautiful woman. - Can you shut the fuck up? Okay, babe, no, seriously. He's been her employee for years. One, I think it's illegal if they fuck. And two, he'll never close the deal. She had that glow in her eyes. Okay, okay, fine. No, she fucking might have. But he won't even come close to closing the deal. - What? - Not at all. 1,000 percent they're fucking tonight. - Fuck that. - Unless Robbie's dick gets chopped up, they're gonna fuck tonight. What are you fuck... Fuck that. Okay. All right. - You want him bet? - Yeah. Okay, great, great, great, great. Alright, how much you fucking want to bet then? Are you ever going to settle down, you know, chill the fuck out. Are you? - Yeah. - Yeah? - Hopefully. - Oh, okay, great. Well, maybe I'll fucking settle down when I can find a man that can keep up with me. Do you know how hard it is being in a world surrounded by so many boys that can't handle a woman who can out drink, out earn and out fuck them, for the love of God? Do you know how many men cannot fuck? - There's a few. - No. - And some can. - None of them know how to eat pussy. I'll tell you that right now. - See, I beg to differ. - No. In fact, I would argue there are one, maybe two people in this general vicinity who can do it with the ferocity of a fucking tyrannosaurus No, No. - Larry. - Larry. Can you please, for the love of God, give me one more round. I'll be you that if they fuck, I'll make you a steak dinner. - Really? - Yeah. Wearing nothing but an apron. If I lose? Oh, when you lose, you have to eat my ass out on this throne. Well, why wait? Why don't I eat it fuckin' right now? Daddy's hungry. Ah! Daddy! Oh! I can trace it back every fucking time. The second they cut their hair, they cut their worst record! Ah, it's just such an absurd claim. It isn't... It's a fucking absurdly correct claim. Is what it is. Okay? Do you remember that fucking study I showed you? - Oh, yeah. The scientist one. - Yes, the fuckin' scientist one. The second that they cut the hair of a Native American person, they lost, like, - all sense of intuition. - Okay. - Like fucking all of it. - First off. - And it's really scary. - First off. Whatever bullshit fucking blog you pulled that study off... - A government study, dude. - Government. Has about as much merit as the fucking Reddit thread. - Okay. - Second off, second off, that has absolutely zero fucking merit when it comes to talking about somebody's actual musical ability. Okay. I'm going to go through the fucking list. - Okay, do it. - Metallica. - Yeah? - Yeah. They cut their hair, the fuckers release "Load." Yeah? Soundgarden. Cornell cuts his hair off. Opts for the Spencers Gift tips with the frosted spikes, and then the motherfuckers release "Superunknown"! - What is that?! - Boom! Boom right there, bitch! Voids your argument? Do you know why? - Why? Tell me why. - 'Cause "Superunknown", - peak Soundgarden. - Oh, fuckin'... - Are you kidding me? - Not one bad track on the album. Are you actually going to stop with the fucking Jesus Christ pose right now? What the fuck?! Are you serious?! Are you fuckin'... Are you fucking kidding me? That's so fuckin' dumb, so fuckin' dumb. Let me guess. You prefer you prefer, uh, you prefer Van Hagar? "Prefer" is a strong word. They lost zero appeal when Diamond Dave ducked out. - Oh! Really? - Yes, really. Because it's around that time that they got rid of their guitar god, and then replaced him with a synth loving clone of said guitar god. Alright, get your ass off the bar, Robbie. - Oh. - Hate to break up the party. I got four little diaper pissers at home. They're going to wake me up in four hours. Let's... Yes, thank you. I don't want to listen to this fucking guy anyway. - Sweet baby. Jesus. - Mm, got my card. Slow your roll, Larry. Got two more coming my way. - I'll pour you one. - Hands behind your back. - Hands behind my back? - You're lucky like you. Yeah, and you're lucky I don't have health inspector shut this shit hole down. He's right. Is he right? - And pour Tori and her new beau. - Oh, thanks, man. One and one for yourself, Larry. I didn't know you two were a thing. - We're not. - Yet. Get fucked. Ah, yeah! The wife's back is with her family. So that's why I'm spending Christmas alone. Unless you count that fucking mutt that won't keep its trap shut. Why do you have a fucking dog then, man? You think I wanted that thing? - That's all Donna. - Okay. That little son of a whore is like an angel around her. But with me, just me, it won't shut the fuck up because I won't spoil him, like Donna does. Just like with her old man. Yeah, I think... I think it sounds like the dog just probably needs, like, some lovin' from Daddy Monroe. - Like. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think the little bastard needs his balls clipped. - Hey, man. - Sure. Donna had me get my balls clipped - two days after Henry was born. - Jesus fucking Christ. You're gonna wake up a sleeping, Junior. Well, uh, here, let's have a toast. I think you've had enough there, Supercuts. Cheers. Cheers. Here, let me, uh, cover what these kids are drinking. - Oh, no, no, that's... - No, hey, hey, hey, hey. - You... - Thank you, Chief. - Keep the rest for yourself. - Thank you. Watch yourself with that one. Merry Christmas, Sheriff. Shit, that little punk motherfucker, wipe that smirk off... Mm. That sucked the fucking Christmas early. God damn, what a sad fuckin' human being. You gonna be good to drive? Uh, no. I drove with Robbie... I fuckin' walked with Robbie. If I drove you, you'd be fucked. So much for drinking every guy under the table. Excuse me. You've got, like, at least five pounds on me. Soaking wet maybe. Get her home safe. Robbie. What the fuck's that's supposed to mean? - It's a big world out there. - You get home safe. Better watch for your children. - I'm just kidding. - Sounded so threatening. - Good night. - Thank you, Larry. - Ugh. - Come on. Yes! Oh, shit. Not yet. It's coming early. Hold it. No, baby, hold it. Hold it! You better not! Fuck! You better not! Ah! Like, what did he arrest you for? It was fucking... You were like... You were like pissing on a playground. I didn't know the kid was going to show up like that. Oh, fuck, and the kid was his grandson. Yeah, I made him a man. That's fucked. You took that away from him. - I know. - You took it away him. Somebody help! Do you want to keep drinking, or...? I mean, yeah. What are you thinking? - What am I thinking? - Yeah. You can come over and kill that bottle with me. - Really? - Yeah. - Are you sure? - Yeah. Come kill the fucking bottle. I said come over for a drink, not over for a fuck. Well, it sounds like someone's hankering for a little bit of... - You hear that? - Hear what? Yeah, dawg! Jay hitting that pipe. Yeah, he's hitting that fucking pipe. Speaking of, have you seen it? Yeah, it's fucking fat as fuck. - It's fat. - Oh, he be gaping that shit for sure. How old are you, fuckin' 12? I can see you smoking that blunt from here! - I didn't fuckin' ask... - I said give it to me! I need to salvage this Lincoln Log... - No! - Before you run it into the fuckin' ground. Yeah, I want to fuckin' salvage this thing. What are we watching when we get to yours, "A Christmas Story"? What is your fucking obsession with "A Christmas Story"? What's your issue with "A Christmas Story"? You're the one that brought it up earlier. Everyone's obsessed with it. If you want to watch a Bob Clark Christmas movie will watch fucking "Black Christmas." Oh, that... That Blumhouse joint? I'm just going to drive myself home. No, no, no. You said we were going to my car... If you want to go home and fucking jerk off - to fucking Blumhouse movies... - Get your fuckin' ass over here. Okay, but are you done spewing garbage out of your fuckin' - whore mouth? - Oh, there it is. There's your fuckin' Rhode Island accent. I maybe sound like I'm from Rhode Island, but at least I don't have shit taste in movies, shit opinions on everything, and drive a fucking shit car. Uh, excuse me, this is basically the same as your fucking car. Don't say that about her. She's beautiful. - Also... - I get her first. My lady. My lady. You got to get in on this side. You haven't got this fucking car fixed yet? With what you pay me, you think I can afford a fucking door? What are you doing with your paychecks? - This is... - My minimum, my minimum... That's embarrassing. My minimum fucking wage paycheck. Yeah, your minimum fucking wage paycheck. - Get it. - That should be - a fucking priority. - Please. - Wow. - Lady. No, I changed my fucking mind. I changed my mind. Hop in, hot shot. We got fucking whiskey waiting. - Get in. - Oh, whiskey you say? - Yes. - Okay, in that case, - shut your fucking mouth. - Oh, this mouth. This fucking whore mouth and that devil's tongue, baby. - Ew, shut the... Robbie. - Come on, what? - This is a... - Get your fuckin' ass in. Don't touch my fuckin' ass. She got a bit of a fight in her. All right. - Call fucking H.R. - I'll give you space. No wonder you don't get fuckin' laid. - Look at this. - What? No wonder you don't get fucking laid. - This is disgusting. - It adds to the flavor. Adds to the flavor of what? A fucking chicken coop. This is fucked up. Some empty cans and bottles. That's Tori Tooms' break? No, but it's the nail in the fucking coffin because this is really bad. - Come on, baby. - How do you live like this? - Let's cowboy up. - Just take my car. Just take my fucking card. You just got to be patient with her. I'm gonna lose my buzz. - Hey! - Oh, God. - Jesus. - Feel that between my pants. We're going to have to roll this up the hill ourselves. - Alright. - Whoa. Jesus fucking Christ. I don't feel safe. What are you... okay. She's road worthy. Don't even worry about it. Okay! Here we go. Oh, if this guy parks his fucking Ranchero here one more time, I'm going to total it, smash out his fucking windows. Little harsh to the Griswolds. NO, it's boozin' Benny down at the bottom of the hill. - He's a fucking alcoholic. - Boozin' Benny. Just pull up behind my sister's car. Wait. Your sister is here? Do you not listen to a fucking thing I say? Well, I mean, I listen, but I don't retain. Yeah, well, I don't want to retain the stink from this fucking chicken coop, so get out. Come on, let's go drink. - Beautiful. - Oh, Jesus. - All right, my lady. - Listen, I really can't... Please exit your chariot. I honestly... I'm... whoa. I'm too drunk for this. Jesus. Walk carefully, please. Thank you. And treat her with respect and dignity. Uh, welcome to my humble abode. Yeah, it's cute. It's uh... Charming, classy, cute. I know. - Yeah, sure. - Extravagant. - Rustic. - Yeah. Humble. Barn-like. I really hope we don't take my sister out because I don't want to have to awkwardly introduce you. Wait, so are we drinking alone tonight, or what? Robbie, do not fucking listen to me? They're out cold. Out cold already? It's not even midnight. Plus, my lame ass brother in law doesn't even drink, so... Oh, that fucking cunt Mike. Yeah? Mr. Hollywood? Yeah. These goddamn neighbors and their fucking obnoxious lights. Hey, Tori. How much music was there in "Unsolved Mysteries"? - What? - I mean, like, I don't... I don't want to... I don't want to scare you, like, in your own home, but there's like six hours worth of the "Unsolved Mysteries" soundtrack? What the fuck is your problem with "Unsolved Mysteries"? I mean, like, 30 second intro, and then, like, do you need six hours? Have you heard it? No, not the entire fucking expanse of isolated soundtrack. Oh, well, it is the fucking creepiest goddamn synth pads you will ever hear in your fucking life. - Mm-hmm. Right. - They're amazing. Put it on. Yeah, okay. No, I've already got something queued up. No, put it on. I want you to get like soaked up and like - immersed in it. - No, no, no, I'm good. - I'm good. - It's so good. Please. Robbie. All right, fine. At least I know it won't be "Load." - Oh, I know. I already looked. - Oh, did you? Of course. Oh, come on, Robbie. "Rhythms From a Cosmic Sky" is, like, at least four times... Oh, you're the worst fuckin' opinion. No, everybody knows that. What are you talking about? Uh, it's in your collection. Yeah, because I'm a completist. Thank you. - Not for Metallica. - Shut up. Follow... get that fucking thing away from me. Okay. I'm weirdly turned on by this. - Really? - But I need you to stop. Hey, Freddy. Buddy, let's not open gifts.

Not better. No. Edward Furlong, Clancy fucking Brown. Who, by the way, chews up scenery like it's a piece of fucking gum, and that soundtrack. They've got 12 tracks of female fronted fucking aggressive as hell, early '90s grunge! Traci Lords has three goddamn songs on the album, and they're fucking good, they're so good. So, you think it's better because Traci Lords, porn star, fucking superstar, big titty Traci Lords has, what, like, fuckin' two tracks on the album. No, three, by the way, and better story. Better music, obviously. Better kills. Better makeup, better fucking cast and... Lord Gwynn aside, I will say, you got me there. But Mary Lambert, she was finally given free reign. - Yeah, that was a mistake. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. - What the fuck are you doing? - What?

Just us right now, sir. Any sign of Davies? He's dead, sir. Fuck! Fuck! Motherfucker! I just saw you at Reggie's three goddamn hours ago. I don't understand. What is there to fucking understand? What I don't understand is the lax fucking attitude when people are fucking dead. Look, Tori, we know you didn't murder anyone, but we're having a hard time believing what you're saying. I'm having a hard time fucking believing it. Okay? But I saw it. I saw it with my own goddamn eyes. And my fucking eyes don't lie. Okay, Monroe?

We're all getting a little emotional here. Just cut it. Both of yous. You, sit down. Get this fucking off your fucking desk. Have you heard from the boys down at the scene yet? Not since Renn County showed up. They're still down there counting bodies. Nothing about a killer Santa Claus either. Well, why don't you give him a call? It's been a little while now. See if they need any help. I think they got it under control. Double check. Fuck! You need to keep that asshole away from me, Monroe. He's worked with Davies for over 15 years now. We're tight staff. Look around. It's been a rough night for all of us. Bear with us. We'll do the same. Just breathe. Okay, I'm going to brew a fresh pot of coffee. There's a bathroom down the hall if you want to clean yourself up some. There is no fucking back up, man. Just hold on a second. Just hold on a second. We got to think this out. Oh, shit. Have tried the guys from Renn? Yep, Renn, paramedics, Weston. Nothing. CHP? Anything? - Nope. - Hey. Hey. Hey. - What's going on? - You coming with me or not? Something happen? You guys can't go back to my house. - I told you. - We're police, Tori. - That's what we do. - Well, no. You need to call the fucking National Guard or something. He wiped everybody out. He's going to wipe you out! Hey, you know, Monroe, maybe you should stay here. You can, baby sit the little girl. Okay, you know what? If you don't want to fucking listen to me, you go out there and die. Because, quite frankly, I don't fucking care. Tori, we're going to go, we're gonna lock the door. - No, no. - Oh, oh, oh, oh. What is that? Yeah. What the fuck is that? That an ambulance? Oh, fuck. It's him. Oh, Santa Claus? - Yeah, it's fuckin' Santa Claus. - Fuckin' Santa Claus! It's the motherfucker that killed everybody. Okay, okay, uh... - Oh, fuck. - He's not stopping. Fuck! Fuck! Ah! Is everyone all right? Yeah, I think I'm fine. - Tori? - Uh, yeah. Jesus Christ. What the fuck was that? Hey, Tori, take these, go to the holding room, lock yourself in. No, no, no! There's fucking people dead. You need to give me a gun. You need to give me a fucking gun. - Where the driver? - You're 38. Give her your 38. Are you out of your fucking mind? - Give me your fucking gun. - Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, do you even know how to use that thing? Yeah. You aim is and pull the fucking trigger. Yeah? Let's go. Cover me. Okay. I'm clear. Tori, get in there! Stay away from the fucking car!
