THE MONEY ORDER WRITTEN AND DIRECTED BY Who wants to buy water? Who wants to buy water? -Peace be upon you. -And upon you. -Is your husband in? -Who are you looking for? Ibrahima Dieng. The husband of both of you. -I bring very good news. A money order. -A money order? A money order and a letter from Paris. Who does Ibrahima know in Paris? How much is the money order for? It's worth... 25,000 francs. 25,000 francs? Please do not dash our hopes. We are decent women. I'm good at my job. This money order is for your husband. There's also this letter. He can cash it at the post office this afternoon. Stop getting our hopes up. Aram, get the basket and let's go to the store. Today, we're going to eat. All praise to God. All praise to God. All praise to God. What a big meal. My thanks to you, women. May it be blessed. All praise to God. And to the Prophet. God have mercy on his prophet Muhammad. All praise to God. Dear, here's some papaya for you. Wash this for me. All praise to God. All praise to God. -I haven't had such a meal in ages. -God will never abandon us. God helps those who help themselves. I feel exhausted today. Dear, there's someone begging. -Is he young or old? -Old. Give him the leftovers so as to ward off evil. Follow him. All right. -Aram. -Yes? Aram. Massage my legs. Easy, don't touch the belly. -Have you told him about the money order? -Wait until he gets rested. Who wants to buy water? -Maty, can you spare 50 francs for water? -I'm penniless. Aram, do you want to buy water? -On credit? -Until when? Tomorrow. -It's 50 francs. -I know. You show him the way. What's this? Just look at that. When your bellies are full, all you want to do is sleep. What about God? There's no room in my house for unbelievers. Huh? Where do you think I find the money to feed you? I've been without a job for the last four years. Today is Friday and nobody thought of waking me up. What a shame! Prayer has its appropriate time. Wait, dear! What is it? I'm penniless. Look, I have nothing in my pockets! -That's not what I mean, dear. -What then? -Someone brought a paper for you. -What paper? -It's not a tax form. -How do you know? It's a money order from Paris. -A money order? -Yes. -Who sent it? -Abdou, your nephew. Let's not talk about money in the street. I hope the neighbors do not know about this. -The thing is, we did go to the store. -Then everybody knows I received it. There was nothing for the kids to eat today. What? How dare you borrow without my permission! I'm the husband here! Only I can decide what to do! Good wives consult their husband before making any decisions. Now everybody knows I received a money order. -Peace be upon you. -And upon you. Peace be upon you. -How are you, Mbarka? Fall! -How do you do, Dieng? -Your wives came to borrow rice and oil. -You did the right thing. God willing, I'll pay you. I have a money order. -How much do I owe you? -That's not why I wanted to see you. You know I trust you. I received a shipment of good rice. The one you had for lunch today. Look. It's not from France, nor from America. It's straight from Indochina. It does not stick. Look how beautiful it is! How much is the kilo? You're not just a customer, you're a brother. Stop being so suspicious. The rice is — -Mbarka, do you have rice? -No, my son, I don't. You saw and heard it yourself. I could have sold it now if you weren't such a friend. I'll keep 15 kilos for you, not more. Come get it on your way back from the post office. Give it to one of my children. Add this to my account and lend me 50 francs to go to city hall. Here. -Dieng, how is your family? -No complaints. All praise to God. Mbarka received a shipment of rice, but he sells it under the counter. That's news to me. He won't lend me anything because he knows I'm broke. -Where are you going? -I am coming with you. POST OFFICE My wife opened it. She didn't know. The letter was sent from Paris... by your nephew Abdou. Dear Uncle, I am writing to you from Paris. I inquire about your health and your well-being. I'm doing well in Paris. Do not think I came here to France... to go astray, or rebel against authority. I came to find a job, make some money and learn a trade. I left Dakar because there are no jobs. I cannot remain day in and day out, all my life, without a job... waiting for leftovers or handouts from others. At my age, I need to get married and staff a family. Do not pay attention to rumors about those living in the West. One doesn't go astray unless one wants to. God willing, not a single drop of alcohol will touch my lips. Every day after work, I will attend evening school to learn something. Here's a money order for 25,000 francs. Keep 20,000 for me. Give 3,000 to my mother. And take 2,000 for yourself, because I know you don't have a job. Tell my mother I am well. I miss her and the kids. Every day after work, I go home and say my five daily prayers. My regards to Aunt Maty, Aunt Aram and to the kids. God willing, I'll come back home someday. Do not forget me in your prayers. Your nephew, Abdou. -That will be 50 cents. -Fifty cents? -Yes. -I'll pay you after I cash my money order. -Ibrahima Dieng. -Here. -Your identity card. -What? Your identity card. I don't have one. Anything with your picture on it? A driver's license or draft card would do. I don't have either of those. -Go and get an identity card. -Where? I do have mine. -The money order isn't in your name. -But he's my friend. I'm sorry, sir. Sir, I do not have an identity card. You'll have to get one at your precinct. They can make you one. The money order will be held here for 15 days. Next. What about my money? Take it easy, sir. Let him be. -He owes me 50 cents. -We haven't cashed the money order! Ask for your due politely, without grabbing me. I am a man of faith, not a thief. You crook! You must pay me for the work I did for you. -But don't grab me. -We haven't cashed the money order. -We haven't. -Why didn't you say so before? -I want my money, you crook! -You're the crook. -Let's go. -Who's the crook? Let's go. We'll pay you after we cash the money order. -Check my clothes. Did he get them dirty? -No, he didn't. Can you believe this? He'd get me dirty over 50 cents. -Want to walk with me to the police? -How far is it? Why, you want some cash? Indeed. I want you to lend me only 5,000 francs. That's the house. It might do... but is it for sale? Leave that to me. The fellow is broke. Two wives, seven kids and a hopeless show-off. What's going on? Looks like a party. I have no idea, but here comes his first wife. We'll soon find out. Greetings, auntie! -Mbaye, how are you? -Doing well. How's everyone? -Greetings, sir. -Greetings, ma'am. -How are you? -Just fine. -We've come to visit uncle. Where is he? -He's gone to the post office. To the post office? What's going on here? Are you having a party? You know people. You mention money and they all come running. Maty, when Ibrahima comes back, tell him I want to see him. -He'll get your message, God willing. -Sure. It's prayer time. Otherwise, I'd wait. Mbaye, do come in and wait for him. No, thanks. Just tell him we came by to pay him a visit. -Okay. Thank you. -Thank you. -Give my regards to your family, sir. -Thank you. POLICE STATION -Peace be upon you. -And upon you. -How can I help you? -I need an identity card. We need your birth certificate, three photos and a 50-cent stamp. My son, I'm trying to cash a money order at the post office. I have my tax receipt and my voter's registration. There's nothing I can do without a birth certificate, photos and a stamp. I have a paper that shows I am me. Isn't that enough? That won't do. Go to city hall and get a birth certificate. -Peace be upon you. -And upon you. -How are you doing? -All praise to God. -And the children? -Very well, thank God. Go in, Iman. He's inside. -Peace be upon you. -And upon you. Greetings, Iman. -How are you, Dieng? -Welcome. Have a seat. -Dieng. -How are you? -I'm well. -How's the family? -Everybody's doing well. Thanks! -Long time, no see. -That's true. -Are you having breakfast? -Please join in. -May God bless you. -All praise to God. -All praise to God. -All praise to God. -That's enough. Thanks! -Are you sure? -Here, have some bread. -Pass me the sugar. -Here you are. -I stopped by to see you yesterday. -Indeed, the women told me. -All right. -God bless. -All praise to God. -How is it? -It tastes great. You know life is hard for people like us. That's why I come to seek your help. Indeed, but as God is my witness, I still haven't cashed the money order. -No worries. -May God bless you. 5,000 francs is all I need and I can leave you a deposit. Oh, don't worry about that. I would've given you gladly. But by God, I still haven't cashed the money order. I believe you. -Peace be upon you. -And upon you. -Welcome, Madiagne. -I hope I'm not bothering you. -Not at all. -We were just commenting on life nowadays. Times are tough nowadays. I've come to borrow ten kilos of rice from Ibrahima because we haven't eaten in three days. I was just telling Iman that I haven't cashed the money order yet. That's what he just told me. It's not money I'm asking for but only some rice. Five kilos to live on for two days. -Ibrahima, so long. -You're leaving? Do not forget me, you are my only hope besides God and His Prophet. -God willing, you can count on me. -All praise to God. Ibrahima, help me out. -Maty? -Dieng. -Give Madiague three kilos of rice. -We do not have any rice left. Stop talking back to me. Maty. Maty, help me. As a mother, you should know about hungry children. Now everyone thinks we have rice. -What's going on? -He said to give Madiague some rice. -Tell him there's no rice left. -That's what I told him. -Here's all the rice we have left. -Give him the bag. Never. I won't do it. What will happen to our kids? No one should do this. Here's all the rice we have left. Madiague, take this. God willing, we'll be fine after I cash the money order today. -Thank you. This is better than nothing. -Many thanks. -So long. -Have a great day. Any luck? -Any luck? -That's it. That's it? But yesterday he brought in 100 kilos of rice. -This is what Maty gave me. -It's Maty who rules the house. May God protect us from women's dominance. Amen. Does anyone here have 25 francs? It's for my bus fare to city hall. I'm penniless. Maybe Aram has money. She's at the water fountain. Aram, do you have 25 francs? I need it for my bus fare. -Not a cent. -All praise be to God. There he goes. He won't have a penny left after he pays Mbarka. Is it a deal or not? I would take it. 20% isn't a big deal. Nobody ever died of debt. -Stop bullshitting. Deal or not? -At 20% interest? Take it or leave it. I know, but admit that it's a tough one. Borrow from John and pay Paul. Life is a struggle. I only manage by using postdated checks. All night long, I tried to work out a scheme. But six months without pay, forget it. Debt doesn't kill, you know. I'm on my third repossession. Do you know how I manage? I move to a different bank. The government knows about that. That's why they take payroll deductions. -Well, I'll take your offer. -As I said, I'm trying to help. I'm fed up with work. What do you want? -What do you want? -A birth certificate. Your month of birth? Here are my papers. I can't read. Forget your papers. I need your month of birth. -Help him out. -Mind your own business. -What's wrong with you? -Don't get smart with me. You better be polite to citizens. His name is Ibrahima Dieng, born in Dakar around 1900. -If you're so smart, tell me the month. -Around 1900. -How many months in a year? -Twelve months, of course. And in what month was your Ibrahima born? Come back when you figure out your date of birth. -Make it quick, we're in a hurry. -Step back or... Or what? Who could I turn to? Someone influential? What will I tell the neighbors? How can I face them? Hamath? Hamath? Hamath? -I am not Hamath. -My apologies. I thought you were my nephew. You look very much alike. I understand. I'm sure he would've given me 20 francs for my bus fare. Unfortunately, I'm broke, sir. -Really? What a resemblance! The world's going nuts. It's a wild place. I'll go and see Hamath. -Well, well. Do come in, Uncle. -Hamath. I'm glad you came to see me. Say hello to Uncle. -How are you? -I'm good. I just saw someone who looks like you. Your twin. I came because I have a money order to cash at the post office. But I unfortunately don't have an identity card. To get an identity card, I need a birth certificate. I just came back from city hall. But I don't know anyone influential there. You're my only hope for this. Take this, it's the only cash I have on me. Thank you. Thank you. I'll write you a check. Go cash it at the bank. Yes, yes. Thank you. For the birth certificate... let's go to city hall. I have a friend there. Very well. Uncle, it's been settled. Come and see him tomorrow. Thank you. Here it is: Ibrahima Dieng, born around 1900 in Dakar. -It will be done. -Thanks, old buddy. -Thanks. -Bye. All praise to God. Sir, for God's sake, help me. I need 20 francs for my bus fare back home. I'm a stranger here. My children are waiting for me. Many thanks, may God bless you. What a misfortune. Thank God I had change on me. I didn't even ask her name. I don't even know her. May this coin shield me and my family from evil. -Hello, sir. How are you? -I'm doing well. -Where are you going? -I have a check I want to cash. Do you have the documents? An identity card? -No, I don't. -I can handle that for you. Yes. I sure can, for 100 francs. -It's a deal. -Let's go then. PAYMENTS - DEPOSITS -So how did it go? -All praise to God. It's all good. You know, the teller is a good friend of mine. He's only asking for 300 francs. That's expensive! You know how tough things are. He has a family to support. Very well. Here. Sir, help me, please. I'm a stranger in this city. And I've had nothing to eat all day. You have some nerve. You just asked me and I gave you 20 francs. It was you. I just gave you 20 francs. Sir, you've mistaken me. How dare you! You were wearing the same clothes. I just gave you 20 francs, and you dare ask for more. Sir, let me be. I'm a decent woman. Do not sully my reputation. When begging becomes a trade, what will happen to this country? Look over there. Close your mouth. Open your eyes just a little bit. -Is it for an identity card? -Yes, it is. You came to the right place. That's perfect. Raise your chin a bit. Perfect. Let's wait for the photo. Here we go. There goes the bird. -That's it. -Thank you. -How much? -300 francs. A hundred. Three hundred. -When should I come by? -Tomorrow afternoon. It will be ready around 6:00 pm. Thank you. Thank you. This money order This money order will make everything all right It will be such a welcome change All the borrowing and begging will be a distant memory Where there is life, there is hope You've honored us, Dieng We pray for you We wish you a long life We will not tire This money order This money order will make everything all right Aram, when are you going to pay me? Stop pestering me. If I had the money, I would pay you. Take it easy. Let's be kind to one another Where there is life, there is hope Whoever says money isn't good ltis because they aren't rich When you have money You can afford whatever you want How much are these? I don't like this one. I like that one. Yes. And this one? Come back tomorrow, I'll pay you. Yes. -Peace be upon you. -And upon you. -Is Ibrahima back yet? -No, he isn't. When he returns, tell him I'm still waiting for him. Sure. We will. Maty, did you count how many people came by? Why bother? As long as they think we have money, they'll keep harassing us. By the way, we're out of rice again. The 15 kilos lasted only three days. We also owe three kilos you borrowed from the store. When you add three to 15, that makes 18 kilos. Then comes the cooking oil. Five liters. Add the 300 francs we borrowed from the store. Don't forget to add that bra of yours. Not to mention what we owe for water and charcoal. And I'm telling you you're forgetting something. What else? That's not all. We forgot the eight cans of tomato. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. You know what? Well, from now on, no more giving. -No more giving charity. -That's for sure. If you try to help nine poor people, you'll soon become the tenth. Did you deliver my message? I sure did, but your uncle's so busy with his money order. I see. When he returns, tell him to come see me. I'll be expecting him. Very well. Look who is coming. Aram, come here! Could that be Astou? -That's her. -Wow! I warned you that I'd leave tomorrow with my 3,000 francs. Don't you dare tell me you haven't cashed the money order. Astou, God knows that I had to borrow even the rice you eat today. That's none of my business. I can do without your rice. I didn't come here to beg. My son earned the money that you refuse to give me. Give me my money. You and your two wives are here living off my son's sweat. Astou, calm down. God willing, Ibrahima will see his connections. You'll return tomorrow with your money. Stop finding excuses. You can side with your husband. -Not at all. -But all I care about is my money. I'm tired of borrowing clothes from the neighbors when I come here. He hasn't cashed the money order yet. Do not come back empty-handed. I want my money! Dear. -Here, pawn this. -But it's yours. Take it. Wealth protects us only from dishonor, not from death. -Peace be upon you. -And upon you, Dieng. Fall. -I haven't seen you for — -I never stopped thinking about you. I also need your help. This is gold. I want only 5,000 francs. I'm being harassed by my older sister. Actually, I'll surely cash the money order in a few days. What makes you think I have that much money on me? Mbarka! -Hurry up, your tea's getting cold. -I'm coming! Do you know how much you owe me? I can no longer give you credit. -Mbarka! -I'm coming! Mbarka, I want to pawn this. What do you want? It's gold. Can I have a look? I'll take it for 2,000 francs. You have three days to pay me back. -2,000 francs. -I paid 15,000 for it. Here, take it back. In two days, I'll have cashed my money order. Mbarka here is my witness. Give me at least 4,000 francs. I'm just trying to help you. I'll give you 2,000 francs. You'll pay 500 francs as interest. The total will be 2,500. Interest is immoral. Don't you fear God? Like I said, 2,000 francs plus 500 interest. -2,000 francs? -2,000 francs plus 500 interest. -For three days only. -I'll take it. If you don't show up in three days, you forfeit your jewelry. I told you I have a money order. God willing, I'll pay you. Thanks. -If it's not in three days, you lose it. -God willing, I have a money order. Scarfs! Scarfs for sale! Scarfs for sale! All praise to God. I just came from your house. I have a big problem to take care of. I want you to lend me 5,000 francs. You're my only hope. God knows I can't. Money has no roots, but it grows in a man's heart. Don't be selfish. Help those who are in need. The money you see in my hand is not mine, it's my sister's. Don't let the women mislead you. Man is the remedy for man. -I'd like to lend you that sum. -God be praised. I'd like to help, but as I said, I'm penniless. The money order and this money... are not mine. They belong to my sister. All of this is to tell you that I can't help you today. Who wants to buy water. -Peace be upon you, everyone. -And upon you. Yesterday, I saw him counting a bundle of bank notes. His wives run the house. Solidarity has become a thing of the past. If in three days I don't get the balance, I'll come back. You still owe me 1,500 francs. God willing, I'll get my photos today. -I have all my paperwork. -Just remember what I said. In two or three days, you will see me again. God willing, you'll get your money. I'll write to Abdou today. Don't you dare mention my name. I'll write him myself. He's my son. At your age, you don't even have papers. Shame on you. -All aboard. Time to leave. -My regards to the family. So long. This is my third time here. Every time, it's closed. Your pictures didn't come out. Get lost! -But I paid for them. -I don't care! You'll regret this! You won't get off that easily. -What did you do to the old man? -What's just happened? Can't you see what he did? But that doesn't justify what you've done to him. I'm going to kill him! He broke my table! Mam), get me the home of wine. Hey, buddy. Someday you'll get caught at this game. I'm not worried about it. In this country, only the crooks live well. -We're wasting our time. -That's how you see it. You're not being serious. -Let's drink. -Gladly. Oh, my God! They killed him! He's going to die. They killed him. He's going to die! They killed him! Help! -He's going to die! They got him! -They killed him. They've killed him. -They almost killed him. -He's going to die. Help! He's dying. What's going on? Ibrahima has been beaten and robbed of more than 100,000 francs. He was attacked by two bandits. Not two, there were four of them! They assaulted him! The money order wasn't even his. It was his nephew's. Come on, go home. It's prayer time. Come on, go home. It's over. Let's go. -Maty! Aram! -Dieng. Look at all the things people brought us. Why did you spread these lies that I was beaten and robbed? What am I going to say now? A lie that unites is better than a truth that divides. What happens when they find out the order is still at the post office? I'll be the laughingstock of the whole town. Dear, don't say that. Forgive us, we're not alone in distorting the facts. We've never lied before, but times have changed. We didn't really lie, we just tried to dispel the bad feelings generated by this money business. Bras for sale! Bras for sale! Ladies, would you buy a bra? Maybe you're right. But what will I say when the truth comes out? Simply say your wives made it up. Just look. Rice, milk and sugar. Everyone brought something to help us. What will I say when they find out the order is still at the post office? -Peace be upon you. -And upon you. May I help you? -How are you, Ibrahima? -Well, thank God. Rumor has it your money order was stolen. This is the second notice. The money order is still at the post office. I was in bed for three days. I lost one day at the post office. One day at city hall. One day with my nephew, Amath. One day at the bank. And two days for photos I still don't have. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. Nine days, and the money order is still there. Six more days until they send the money back to Paris. Now who can help me with 300 francs for the pictures? All praise to God, Lord of creation. -What's the matter now? -The money is still at the post office. If I don't get an ID card in six days, the money will be sent back. -Back to Paris? -Indeed. We'll all die of shame. Greetings, Dieng. -Sow. -How are you? -Well, thank God. I've been hearing some rather amazing rumors. That's how things are these days, nobody can be trusted. But is it right to measure all grains with the same cup? No mater what kind of grain, a cup is still a cup. True. Nowadays it's hard to find true wealth with contentment. You're right, but this is also true: A river never flows back to its source. -Peace be upon you. -And upon you. -Dieng. -Fall. -How are you? -I'm well, thanks. -How's your health? -Good. Thanks. What are we going to do now? Be patient. Wait three or four more days. I need your help, just 500 francs. Where am I to find the money? You know our deadline has passed. Mbarka, can you sell me candy? I know that, but for heaven's sake, Mbarka, help me. Did you know that you lost the jewelry you pawned? Lend me 500 francs and I'll pay you back 1,000 francs. I have a message for you. Someone wants to buy your house. Never! Never! Over my dead body! Sell my house because I owe you? I'd rather be dead! Being poor, I can handle. Homeless, never! -Why are you shouting? -You have some nerve! The bottom line is you owe me. Pay up. Yesterday, when you were begging for rice, you were not so loud. You trusted me. I'll pay you. But to sell my house? That's out of the question! Get out of my store or I'll call the police. Let's go to the police. Come on, let's go. You and your family can starve, but no more rice from me! Let's go to the police. -Come, let's go to the police. -Leave me alone! -Leave me alone! -Let's go. When you owe, you have to pay. Leave me alone. I'm tired of being pushed around. You say you've been robbed. Liar! You just want the money for yourself! Stop spreading poisonous rumors. He was robbed. I witnessed it. Let me through, let me through. Mbarka, we owe you and we will pay. But don't expect us to skin ourselves for you! I'm talking to your husband. Mind your own business. -That makes it my business. -Let me get to him, he'll be sorry. -Iman, tell them to leave. -When you owe, you have to pay. -They owe me. Look at his wives. -Keep your comments to yourself. -All right, let's go. We're done here. -A man should keep his dignity. -A stooge has no dignity left. -Yes, indeed. Order them to leave. He owes me and his wives want to beat me up. That's not true! You want me to sell my house because I owe you. All right, come on. Let's go, ma'am. There we go. We aren't done with you. All right, we're done here. Come on, let's go. I heard about your money order. Come see me this afternoon. It's time. He woke up. -How are you, Uncle? -Sarr. -My apologies. -I guess I came early. I heard your money was stolen. No, that's not true. My wives made up that story. Wow, I'm telling you! Women can have some imagination. -I'll be on my way now. -Okay. See you this evening. Now, then, Uncle, we - Speaking. I was taking a nap. Leave that to me. Don't worry about that. He's here. He's right here, I'm telling you. Indeed, it didn't work out at the store. I know it's for your young brother. Listen, he's crippled with debt. Don't worry, you'll get your house. I'll call you at your office tomorrow, okay? All right, bye. Let's go. Give me a power of attorney to cash the money order. How much is he going to ask me for his commission? A thousand francs? That's too little for a man of his caliber. Three thousand? That's too much. The money order isn't mine. But if he asks for 3,000, I'll agree. I'll write to Abdou and tell him I had to pay a businessman... to get my identity card. I'm his uncle after all. Sign this paper for me and that will be all. -In French or Arabic? -Whichever you prefer. Now, give me the notice. Here, take this for your fare. I cannot give you a ride. I have an appointment. Come see me tomorrow. That works. MBAYE SARR, BUSINESS AGENT GRADUATE, ÉCOLE DES HAUTES ÉTUDES -Peace be upon you. -And upon you. Uncle. -Welcome. How are you? -Mbaye. -Have a seat. -Sarr, Sarr. -How are you? -Well, thanks. Praised be God. -Oh, get a second cup for Uncle. -Coffee? -I never drink coffee. -I didn't know that. -What about some milk? -Herbal tea will do. I was about to come see you because you missed me yesterday. You're right. I have cashed the money order. Really? Praised be God. Many thanks. But I'm not going to lie to you. I was the victim of a pickpocket. I know you won't believe me, but God is my witness. Besides your 25,000 francs, I also lost my own 75,000 francs. That's what happened to me. -Mbaye, this money doesn't belong to me. -I know. Mbaye, I have a family to feed. The money order isn't mine, it's my nephew's. I know all that. I knew you wouldn't believe me. Do you think I'd rob you? Mbaye, the money is not mine. I have no money on me today, but tomorrow you'll get your money. Mbaye, it doesn't belong to me. Please have mercy. -I have a family and I don't have much. -I, too, believe in God. Uncle, you don't have to tell me. I know that. -Don't you believe in God? -Mbaye, I do. Hold on. I'll give you some rice. -I'll give you some rice for free. -Mbaye, it's the money order. Put ten kilos of rice in a bag and carry it to my car. -The money order. -You think I'd rob you? If I had the money, I'd pay you. Mbaye, help me. The money order is not mine. Believe in God. Let's go. I'll give you a ride back to your house. -Mbaye, help me. -Let's go. I have a family, and the money order is not mine. Mbaye, help me. Help me. The money order is my nephew's. Mbaye, please. It doesn't belong to me, Mbaye. What's going on? What's wrong with you people? What's gotten into you? Go away. Can't you see he's tired? What's the matter? What happened to you? Mbaye stole the money order and gave me this. What, the money order is gone! What will become of us? What about my jewelry? Shut up! The money order wasn't mine. -Peace be upon you. -And upon you. -How are you doing? -We're doing fine. Ibrahima, I heard you're distributing rice. That's not it. To tell you the truth, decency has become a sin in this country. And that's why I'm going to become a wolf among wolves! I too will become a thief and a liar! -I'll cheat. -But why? Mbaye stole my money order! That's why I say that decency is a sin in this country. Yes. Here's a letter from Paris. As for the country, we'll change it. -Who is "we"? -You. Me? Yes. You, your wives, your children, me. We will change things. -Peace be upon you. -And upon you. I've heard about your generosity. We've been without food for three days. I warned you I'd come back for my money after three days. And take 2,000 for yourself, because I know you don't have a job. Life is hard for people like us. Maty, help me out. As a mother, you should know about hungry children. Sir, for God's sake, help me. I need 20 francs for my bus fare back home. You and your two wives are here living off my son's sweat. Wealth protects us only from dishonor, not from death. Do you know how much you owe me ? No more credit for you. In a country like this, only crooks live well. So they stole your money order? It's Mbaye who stole my money order. That's why I'm saying decency is a sin in this country.
