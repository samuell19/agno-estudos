Weren't you the one who entered her room in the morning? Move to this side. I haven't stolen it, Sir. I swear I haven't stolen it. Have you checked your room and your bag thoroughly? Yes, we did. It's no where to be seen. Sir, that has been stolen. I'm sure about it. I very well remember the place where I kept it. Was the ring insured? - Yes. - No. What? - No, it has not been insured. - Yes, it has been insured. It has not been insured. No, Sir. Do you have a photo of the ring? I don't have an individual picture of the ring. The ring is clear in this photo. Let me see. Move to that side. Anyway, we need to check your bag and the room. Isn't it, Sir? What if they failed to notice the ring while searching? Okay. Shiny will check it out. Come on. No use of crying. It's not a cheap ring, but a diamond ring worth 4 lakhs of rupees that has gone missing. Sir, we were about to check out the room, and leave. What shall we do now? You come to the police station. We will register a case. Sir, please come inside. Did you find the ring? Hey. Remove your shoes. Sorry? Remove your shoes, I say. Bloody, remove your shoes. It's just a waste of time. Give it to me. See. I did not feel that he stole the ring. What made you suspect him? I understood that he is a pauper looking at his car. A car worth 40 lakhs. And all the 4 tyres have been worn out. When the reception boy told that two of his cards were rejected as there was no money in it, I felt a doubt. When I saw the lady shivering, I understood that the thief was not her. Even I had understood that, Sir. I confirmed it not because of that. Didn't I take his phone to look at the photo? I just checked his search history. There I saw 'Diamond price calculator', and 'diamond resale value' on it. Then, where has he hidden it, did he do that with the knowledge of his wife, etc. Was clear from the trick employed by Shiny. As he is a fool, Giri could find him out easily. No, he found him easily not because the guy was a fool, But because he is not a professional thief. It was just an idea that popped up in his mind when he needed money. Even if it is done by a clever person, the result would be the same. Watch and learn how he solves case. Nedumpara. Those getting down at Nedumpara, come. Nedumpara. Get down fast, Sister. Sister. Those getting down at Nedumpara, come. Those at the back must get down. Nedumpara. Those getting down at Nedumpara, get down. Hey, this girl is supposed to get down here. Hello. What a sleep. It's your place. Don't you have to get down? Hi, Giri. I have settled the other case, okay? Okay. You know, both of them are partisans. That's why I asked you to come. Okay. Getting to rule continuously is a matter of headache to us. Why is it so? We will forget how to conduct strikes. Okay, then. Brother. I want two sets of Appam and egg curry, parcel. Take two sets of Appam and egg curry, parcel. Shaji. Heard that a rich team from Ernakulam has come to look for the property. Did you and Thambi swallow him totally? No, that is not a big sale. Salim, one tea. Okay, I will give it now. I was waiting to see you. What's the matter? A few guys from the Kabaddi team had come to meet me. Did you have any scuffle with them last time? Why would they come and meet you? The problem is between them and I, no? There shouldn't be any problem here after. That's all we need. Giri. Don't talk to me like you talk to the guys who come to your station. I don't like it. I'm a social worker. Suresh is a leader of the party that rules the country. You are just a police officer. Perhaps, you will have to salute him tomorrow. Babu, take the parcel fast. Even otherwise, a subordinate need not act like a boss in the presence of actual boss. - Very true. - Isn't it? Giri Sir, your parcel is ready. Bye. The C.I. (Circle Inspector) is in his hands. That C.I. is retiring soon. Heard that the next C.I. is a smart fellow. Now on, his tactics is not going to workout here. I wonder how did he join the police with this figure. Anything is possible with bribe and recommendation in this place, Suresh. You seem to be busy working right in the morning. I guess you are coming back from the temple. Yes. Is it the ailing mom who is doing all the households? What else could I do, dear? Need to cook something at home, no? When I ask him to marry a girl, he gets angry at me. Ask the police boy to hire a maid. He is a no. 1 miser. What's wrong with you, mom? Will you do the households for me? Need to cook something, no? It has been two days since the cooking gas got over. The Gas will come today. For the time being, I have bought you some food as parcel. I don't like hotel food. Adjust for one day, mom. Told you the Gas will come tomorrow. Then? Anyway, it's me who has a short breath, has to cook. How long have I been telling you to stop traditional medicines, and to consult a good doctor? How is that possible? If you don't consume kwath in the evening, your hands and legs would shiver, no? I lived on like this until now. Who knows how long would I be alive? Nice! Where are you going? O' Lord Krishna. There's no Krishna here. Only I'm there to take care of you. Dear, Lakshmi, your classmate just passed this way. Her family is conducting a lot of Pujas, and offerings to the Lord. Still, she is not getting a good marriage alliance. There is some problem in her horoscope, it seems. You don't believe in horoscope, no? I can understand what are you going to say next. When she was in school, she used to come here everyday. She used to like you a lot. Anyway, I'm going to give your horoscope to Manoharan. No need. Hey, be careful. Click a picture from that side. So sad. No comments. Hubby... Carefully. Take him to the ambulance. Hold him. [Sniffing] Will you leave the police dogs jobless? My father was there at home the previous night. Today, by the time we woke up in the morning, he had gone somewhere. Dad... Giri, please come. - What's it? - Just come. Let me see. What's the matter? Will you ask C.I. Sir to avoid postmortem? Oh! That's not possible. First of all, it is an unnatural death. Moreover, if you tear the body... Nothing we do will help to remove the bane. He belongs to our community, no? All of us know that Sudhakaran committed suicide because he incurred loss in his business. We cannot skip the postmortem. That will become a problem. Then, refer the case to the Thaluk hospital. If it is in the General hospital, I'll have to run behind it. I'll talk to him about it. That's enough. This is the last case in my service. If there is any flaw on my part while dealing with this case, I wouldn't get pension from the government. It will be withheld. There is nothing to worry. This is a clear case of suicide. Sir, In Damodaran's case, we took him to the District hospital for the postmortem, and it gave us so much headache. Let's opt Thaluk hospital for the postmortem, Sir. Okay. Dear... This is a list of remedial rituals to be done at the time of an unnatural death. Everything should be done accordingly. Okay? People had gathered even before we reached. Then... Manohar. Giri. C.I. Sir asked for you. I'll come and meet him tomorrow. Sir is retiring tomorrow. Oh, yeah. That didn't cross my mind. Hey. How are the rituals going to be? Dorai Swami will come now. The rituals will be started as soon as he reaches. When Swami directs, the priest will do the rituals accordingly. This is an unnatural death, no? Ramesh. There is no land in this place, that cannot be sold by me. That is not going to workout. Our margin should be given as cash only. There cannot be any transaction through our accounts. Okay? Swami has come. What is so special about him? We also know how to perform the death rituals. He has been called because this is an unnatural death. What did you do before he came to this place? It has been only 10-15 years since Manoharan settled in this place. This is not what you think it is. They are trying to bring strangers, and make them a hero. You know, I'm a person who has studied rituals for years. But you discontinued in the middle, no? - Did you see mom? - She is inside. Are you leaving? I need to go to the station. C.I. Sir is retiring today. Tell her that I left. Okay. No, dad, I'll take care of it, here after. Has Giri Sir got any special gift for C.I. Sir? Of course! That's a suspense. Did you really have to do this, son? - I didn't know anything about it, dad. - Keep it inside. Why are they here? That is regarding a vehicle seized by Sukumaran Sir. The guys who drove it, abandoned the vehicle and left. Which one? The vehicle from which drugs were seized? Ya, that's it. That is his bike. He says that friends had taken his bike. They are waiting for Sukumaran Sir. Suresh is a leader of the party that rules the country. And you are just a police man. Perhaps, you will have to salute him tomorrow. I'd called you, but the call didn't connect. Is it? He doesn't know anything about the drugs. Please convince C.I. Sir. Why do you say please and all? I'll do anything for him. He is all set to go to the Gulf. If it becomes a case, that will be a problem. You will be able to save me. Do something for me, please. Don't worry, dear. This is not a murder case, no? Seized drugs, that's all, no? Let me see what I can do. Sukumaran Sir is busy with C.I. Sir's retirement function. I'll do the needful. You may go now, and come back later. Okay, Sir. Thanks a lot. The colour of the flex looks dull. That's true. You feel that because there is no sufficient light. Keep it towards the light. Rasheed Sir, did you file an FIR for the drugs case? No, C.I. Sir said not to file a case, but just to give them a warning instead. That will become an issue. I think that the news has spread everywhere. - It's better to file the case. - Is it so? Yes, people are talking about it at the junction. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Giri. - Yes. C.I. Sir is calling you. - Calling me? - Come on. How did the people outside come to know about the drug case? I don't know, Sir. But people are talking about it at the junction. Sir, let us exclude the owner guy of the vehicle, and charge Section 27 against the rest of the guys. Let them pay fine at the court. Seizure of drugs at school premises. The police charge weak sections against the culprits. When such a news appears in newspapers, you will be answerable. Already, there are complaints against sale of drugs in that place. Actually, they are to be booked under Section 27(a), under non-bailable offenses. It's another team who sells drugs there. Not these guys. If we charge this section, won't the owner boy also fall in trouble? Won't he become an accused too? Yes, Sir, what's the problem in it? Drugs have been seized from his vehicle, no? Sir, he is going to go to the Gulf. If he goes to the Gulf, he will start smuggling drugs and gold there also. Come with me. What's the problem between you and him? Tell me. Why do you want to lock him? That too, a boy who is known to you very well. Hey, tell me. He is not a good guy. He poked me the other day. I have told you many times that this character of yours is not good. Can you be so cruel to a person for just making fun of you? Giri... Taking revenge for such a silly thing, is not a good trait. That too for a policeman. Dear, that boy is just of my son's age. We don't need to wreak vengeance on anybody today. Leave the matter for my sake. Won't you obey me? Okay. It is said that... [Sanskrit Chants] Do you understand it? No. If there is any hole in the middle of the betel leaf, there will be problems due to ego and pride. Your son is having a difficult time now. I can foresee quarrel, mental trauma due to the quarrel, and fear of death in his horoscope. So... Don't think about his marriage right now. Is there anything that we can do in order to remove the bane? I can suggest a remedial puja. But... you should do it at the temple at Sanyasa hill. Hand the chit that I give you to the priest over there. Okay. O' Lord Subrahmanian. So, 17 is the total strength. Yes, Sir. How many female constables are there? Two. Are they enough? Yes, they are more than enough in this station. 3 of them are on leave today. What is this? This is a list of arms and ammunitions. Okay. Will the people of this place force us to use these arms? No. This is more or less a peaceful police station. - He's very smart. - Vinod. Yes. You guys have known each other for a long time, isn't it? Yes, I have worked with him in Manimala station. How is he? He is a tiger. He left the station after locking all the criminals of the place. I've heard a lot of his stories about solving theft. Oh! He is very much skilled in catching thieves. Superiors always praise him. Nice. Is he strict? What a question! If we don't follow his rules, he will make us shiver. That's good. Here, there are more powerful ministers than the king. Give way for a change. Yes. Some tails will stop moving. Sir is coming. What is this? Don't you know how to wear a cap? Sorry, Sir. Two of you, come with me. Let's go and visit our jurisdiction. I'll come with you, Sir. This is my place. I know everyone. No need. No need of anyone who knows the place. Perhaps, the problematic people could be your relatives or friends. Vinod, you come with me. - Sir. - You may come along. Sir. 6th Kabaddi tournament for Ramdas Memorial Rolling trophy presented by Nedumpara Winners Arts and Sports club, will be inaugurated by our new C.I., Mr. Harilal shortly. In the first round, Sethumada Challengers is playing against. Nedumpara Winners who won the tournament last time. As our new C.I. blows the whistle, the first round of the tournament will begin. The raging Kabaddi tournament is going to begin. We extend a warm welcome to everyone, to the ground. Beat him. The raging competition between Sethumada Challengers and. Nedumpara Winners has begun. Hey, that's a foul. You are watching the raging tournament for Ramdas memorial Rolling trophy. The raging competition between Sethumada Challengers and. Nedumpara Winners. Nedumpara Winners has been leading right from the beginning of the competition. Sethumada Challengers got a point. Please don't make any problem. The referee's decision is final. Please don't make a problem here. Please move out. You must not get inside the court. No one should create a problem there. That's all we need. Giri, don't talk to me the way you talk to the people who come to the station. I'm a social worker. The viewers must not create any problem. All of you may move outside the court. Please obey the volunteers, and the police. All of you move outside. Don't create a hullabaloo here. Don't create a problem here. Who are you to interfere in this? Get out, all of you. Messing with a policeman? Don't push me. Obey what the police say. Move outside. I'm telling you. Can't you understand what I'm saying? Move out. Move out, I say. Get lost, you. Son, forget it. Your time is bad. That's why all these happened. If there is anything, you keep pondering over it. You get up, and come inside. Pillechan. Is it actually the trophy you won by playing Kabaddi? Of course. That picture was taken when we won the district tournament. Back then, during the tournament, did you throw people into the mud? But now, such activities are there. Didn't you watch the video? He took it. Anyway, our new C.I. is smart. It was so stylish. It was really like watching an action movie. Like we throw the curry leaves out of the curry, he was thrown out effortlessly. Where have you been until now? You were supposed to get back to duty at 8.00 am. This is not your wife house to walk in and out whenever you like. This is a police station. Were you trying to protest against me for yesterday's incident? If so, I'll make you suffer. It's very common in our department. There is no officer who hasn't been ill-treated by his superior. Still, I'm not able to tolerate this. When I think about it, See, my muscles are rolling up. This is your problem. I've told you many times not to pamper revenge in your mind. Do you know something? My condition is that of guy who abandoned his family, and later came back home asking for his share. Nobody gives me any respect. They are just your feelings. Feelings, it seems. Leave it. Listen... Do you want me to serve tea outside? Is there only tea? I'm preparing banana fritters. You must cut the banana into very thin pieces, and don't make it fat. The banana and the knife are kept there. If you want thin banana fritters, you may do it yourself. Do you see that? She was like a water snake before. But became a cobra after my retirement. Laugh at my jokes, okay? Come. Let's drink tea. Hello, come inside, I say. Fix a drink for me. No, your quota is over. Fix one more drink. No, brother. No money, no booze. I'll pay the bill. I always pay the bill. I haven't drunk without paying money. I cannot serve you booze without giving money. Hey. Even though I'm a thief, I'm honest. Give it to me. Don't make problems. What's this, brother? Was it yours? Give a peg for me. How many times did I tell you that I can't give you anymore booze? Get lost. Nice! You need not give me a drop, even. Hey, you must understand one thing. Understand? Have you heard of Hitler Mathan? All of you must know about him. He was a tiger in the police department. Once, he took me to the station in connection with a case, and thrashed me very badly. There after, he hasn't worked peacefully until now. Do you know why? Where ever he goes, I steal from all the house in his jurisdiction. He hasn't caught me yet. No place has been left without looking for me. Thus, a tiger S.I. turned into a rat S.I. That's the history. Listened to my story, no? Now, fix a drink for me. Go away instead of creating problems. Rascal. You won't give me booze, will you? Buy a drink for me. Go. Get lost, bro. Go and mind your business. - Don't enact a drama. - Get me a drink. Go away. Is everyone pushing me out? Hey... Moron... If I take a decision, the bottles of booze that are lined up in your shelf, will line up in my house in the morning. Do you know that? He must serve me booze. Who is making a hullabaloo here? He is an old thief of this place. Now, he is not capable of stealing. He drinks at others' cost. Now, this is his job. Give me a match stick. Beedi? Hi, Maniyan. Who are you? Wanna join me for a drink? So, you want to know the trick of stealing to publish in the newspaper. Sir. Sir, you are not actually a journalist. But a police. Why do you have such a doubt? First lesson of stealing. No matter how dark it is, how drunk you are, a robber must be able to identify a police. No matter the police has come in disguise. I'm not a policeman. Even if you are a policeman, I don't care. I'll tell you the secrets behind the art of stealing. But pint is not enough. Sir. No other job in this world demands this level of intelligence and alertness. The expertise of a robber is in entering and exiting the house. Robbers are of different types. Most of them start stealing for money. For some others, stealing becomes an intoxication. Some robbers enter only those houses where there is no one. But I enter only those houses where there are people inside. Why don't you steal from houses where there is no one? There is no thrill in it. Some people steal not just for money. There must be a satisfaction too. Human beings lock money and gold inside the draw, and sleep. Like a demon guarding the treasure. When I see it, my muscles roll up. The excitement of stealing at that point of time cannot be felt in a house where there is no one. That's why... Guess you have a lot of ways to get away from police. We have a lot of tricks to fool police dogs and even big wig officers. However, a thief's life is all about fear. The fear of getting caught anytime. Then, you will ask why we are stealing. Stealing gives you more intoxication than women or alcohol. Once you taste it, you need to get caught for the intoxication to subside. How do you plan a good theft? Good theft. That sound good. You are in a hurry. A theft cannot be planned in a hurry. You need patience. If you have patience, I'll explain everything to you. Hey. Are you going for robbery at night? What a sleep! There is a complaint regarding a road dispute behind the high school. - Go and check it out. - Sir. Sir, this is the way to my house. The entire land belongs to Krishnan Sir. He has a lot of land. Nothing is going to happen if he allows a little space for the way. If Giri Sir talks with him, the problem might solve. No other job in this world demands this level of intelligence and alertness. The expertise of a robber is in entering and exiting the house. Most of them start stealing for money. For some others, stealing becomes an intoxication. Son, we need to go to the temple of Sanyasis. And we must do the offerings prescribed by Subbai Swami. [Thinking about what Maniyan said] Do you hear what I'm saying? Mmm... What Hmm? Are you not here? The only security a robber has is himself. His eyes, ears, and nose should be kept open. If he sees a light, get the smell of a cigarette, sees a movement, he knows that somebody is awake. A house likes the one who walks in secretly. It will provide everything that you need to get inside. When you enter a house, you may get caught anytime. So, a robber starts working only after finding the exit, so that he can escape anytime. When a robber walks, even his legs shouldn't know that he is walking. Otherwise, he loses. Alas! Robber! Robber! Get up. Stop there. Stop there. - What's the matter? - A robber. Robber! Robber! A robber? Stop there. Stop, I say. Robber. Stop there, you robber. That might be just your feeling. No, I saw him with my eyes. Did he run that way? How will you know it, if you sleep like a buffalo? Come on. Sir. Where did you go after closing the house? There was a ceremony at my house. We left before 3 days. And we came back yesterday night. The thief entered the house yesterday, right? Yes, Sir. Are you sure that you saw the thief? Yes, I'm sure. Yes, I saw him clearly. He ran through this door. Did you search everywhere? Are you sure that you haven't lost anything other than 5000 rupees? Yes, that's all we lost. Why would a thief enter a house just to steal 5000 rupees? Go and check properly if anything else is missing. Go and check, Sir. Come, let us check once more. Okay. His face tells that more money has been stolen. He is not saying it because that is bribe money. This village officer takes a lot of bribe. What? Sir, Not just 5000 rupees, but more money has been stolen. He is a person who takes a lot of bribe. That's why he isn't telling the truth. That must be true. Move that side. Move towards the back. Move. Sir, the thief is not from any distant place. He is someone who knew that they were out of station. No, Sir. This is someone from a distant place. How do you know that? Can you come to the gate? - Move. - Bro, move away from the gate. - Move. - Move to the back. Look at this, sir. This is something that a thief from a distant place do. To know if the gate is closed all the time, he will tie a thread on the gate like this. And he will check it in the day time. If the gate has been opened once, the thread would break. Thus, he would have entered the house, as he saw the thread as he tied. And when they returned, they found themselves in trouble. Wouldn't he have noticed the broken thread when he entered the house for stealing? May be, he entered the house yesterday night through another way. So, he wouldn't have noticed. Otherwise, he didn't want to abort a theft he had been planning for a long time. Anyway, only outside thieves do this. Inquire if similar cases have been reported in the surrounding stations. Bro. Okay, Sir. Is it so? Okay, I'll reach now. Sir, a small quarrel regarding the pathway near the school. Shall I go and check it out? Okay. Like wise, the door that he broke in, at the back side... You must record the finger prints on that area. Okay. Sir. Sir, there are 2 chappals lying over there. Sukumaran, when will our dog squad reach? Soon, Sir. Sir, He had promised the other day that, he would allow land for the way. Now, when I'm here with the workers, he says 'no'. I won't consider that he was my school teacher. You need not pass such derogatory comments. Let me speak to him. Didn't you promise to give some land to them, to solve this problem? Is it good to fail, to keep the promise by a person like you who is respected by many? I just said that I would think about it. But I haven't given any promise to him. Leave your adamance and think about it once more. I don't have to think anymore. I have already told them my decision. Subhash, I don't think this is gonna solve. You just talk to them. Let me see what he is telling. - Come here. - What's the matter? Just come here. Come, let me tell you something. What's it, Sir? Are the chappals any one of yours? Mom, The chappals that father was looking for, yesterday. Sir, they are my chappals. They were missing from the yard of my house. Humans are being pranked. Let alone a dog. Take a pair of chappals from somewhere, and put them near the house you are going to steal. The dog will sniff it, and run around for the person. ♪ With dark eyes, he waits for a chance... ♪ ♪ On the branches of the trees. ♪ ♪ He hides like a shadow in search of something. ♪ ♪ The masks knit by the daylight... ♪ ♪ Swayed to and fro in the wind. ♪ ♪ Are you sleeping peacefully with a pride, ♪ ♪ That you have got everything you need. ♪ ♪ Here, when the entire village sleeps, ♪ ♪ A guy is all set to fly. ♪ ♪ With dark eyes, the owl waits for a chance... ♪ ♪ On the branches of the trees. ♪ Don't you want to go for work today? ♪ He comes inside through the open window, ♪ ♪ As wind that is invisible. ♪ ♪ He took the possession of whatever he touched. ♪ ♪ Don't blame him for anything, O' world. ♪ ♪ He is right in whatever he is doing. ♪ This thief doesn't have a particular style of stealing.

The thief is looting the entire place. What crap are you doing in the name of catching a thief? It is because you are useless. It's our hard earned money. Why are you here? I'm here to catch him too.

But it was Giri who investigated the cases then. Yeah, yes. If the thief enters my house, C.I.'s cinema style of investigation will come to an end. Starting from DySP, the entire police force till IG, are my friends. When you enter certain houses, you will feel that you wouldn't get anything. But you must not get upset, and go back. That's because we are not in sync with the house. Then, you must behave as if we are in our own house. If the house likes us, it will show us everything we need. Sir. Okay, Sir. Sir. My ears are not working from listening to the cuss words. Thambi has called everyone, from DySP to IG. This will not workout. We need to find the thief at the earliest. Okay, Sir. If the thief got inside Thambi's house yesterday, he must be someone who knows that. Thambi got the money from the plot sale. That is possible, Sir. Thambi is saying that only Shaji knew about the money. I really suspect Shaji. Shaji has all the freedom at Thambi's house. To know the exact place where the money was kept, the thief must be someone who knows the house very well. I also suspect him. Sir, Shaji is my schoolmate. He had the habit of stealing since he was a kid. I think, if we take him in custody, and threaten him, he will tell the truth. Then, you go and bring him here. Sir. Please avoid me from this. Didn't I tell you? He was my schoolmate. Okay, then send Chandran. Didn't you watch the video, Pillechan? He shot it. It was so nice to see. It was like watching an action movie. Alas! Sir, don't beat me. - Open the door. - Water! Don't give a drop of water to that rascal. Do you want water? If it is you who did that, just confess. Why do you want to get thrashed like this? I promise upon my kids... It's not me, Giri. Please help me get out of here. Okay. I'll speak to them. O' the most powerful, protect me. But Giri, I'm not able to believe it. True that Shaji is a trickster. But I don't think that he would steal. I have known him since our childhood. I told everyone in the station that he wouldn't steal. But nobody listens to me. C.I. Sir needs an accused to save his face. That's all. If you don't catch the thief, make a thief out of the person you catch. Intelligent C.I. Those who hailed the new C.I. is not talking now. I think it is because of his rage against me, Vinod and C.I. Sir thrashed that poor man very badly. Is there no one here to question all these? It is the concerned people who are doing it. I'm leaving. Tomorrow, Comrade Rajendran and partisans are conducting a protest march towards the station. Is it? If they interfere and get Shaji out of the jail, that is a political gain for them, no? Even otherwise, Comrade knows how to make use of the situation. True. Note it on my credit account. How is your mom? Winter is on, no? Yes, Nandan. So, she has weather related difficulties. Okay. Attention. Stand at ease. Attention. Stand at ease. Your duty is at the school premises. Giri and Subhash at the festival premises. Then... - Sukumaran. - Sir. The situation has been reversed. Thambi doesn't suspect Shaji, it seems. He called the head of the police, and said that we caught Shaji deliberately. Now, the DySP will come here, and blast at us. - You come. - Sir. We should've been more careful while taking Shaji into custody. There is no other case registered against him. That is what is the problem here. - The police should uphold justice. - The police should uphold justice. - The police should uphold justice. - The police should uphold justice. - Dismiss C.I. Harilal. - Dismiss C.I. Harilal. Subhash, take the lathi. Hold this. - Release Shaji. - Release Shaji. The police should uphold justice. The police should uphold justice. Okay, stop it now. - Stop. - Stop it now. Decision on whether to release Shaji or not will be taken soon. All of you must disperse for the time being. As the police is incapable of catching the thief, have you locked a poor man inside? We will make you answerable for this. Who the hell are you to make him answerable? Hey, move, all of you. We will release him now itself. And we will arrest the real thief. I promise you. He slapped me without any provocation. Action must be taken against him. Let me inquire about it. We will solve it. You disperse for the time being. As Sir has given a promise, we stop our protest and disperse. - Disperse all of you. - Disperse. What nonsense are all these? Sir, please come. This is not what I had in mind about you. Now it's like, we did not catch the accused, and the locals started opposing the police too. Sorry Sir, we will catch him soon. When is that going to be? Do you want an auspicious occasion for it? - I'll tell you something. - Sir. I give you 3 days' time. The thief must be caught by then. Or else, quit the job and go. Sir. Sir. I wanna tell something. Sir. It is me who told you about Shaji. You got scolded for nothing. If you can close your eyes, I have an idea. What's that? I'll bring a person. He will take the responsibility of all the thefts. No need for it. That will turn into a bigger problem. No one else needs to know about it, Sir. I'll take the risk. If there is any problem, you may leave it to me. Its me who is going to arrest him, no? Sir, dummies are employed even for murders. Let alone a theft. What we need now is time. So, we need a culprit for the time being. By this, your problems will be over. Also we will get some time to find the real culprit. But don't we have to recover the stolen money? Sir, it is Money, that has been stolen. We can say that he spent a large portion of it. By the time, we can find the real culprit, and recover the money. Nope... So, the thief is smarter. Didn't I tell you earlier that you are a police? Leave it. How many cases should I take on my shoulders? 10 to 16. 16 cases? Yes. Is it a big amount? One is a big amount. I'll detail it to you. Are you sure that you will get me out of the case? C.I. Sir has promised me to do so. He will get a good amount as reward. This is a matter of pride for him. Here is 5000 rupees as advance. I'll get you the remaining from him. How did you commit all these thefts? I'll tell you. I thought that we will have to interfere in it. Anyway, there has been a decision on it. - When did they catch the thief? - Yesterday night. Heard that Giri caught the thief alone. The thief has been taken for collecting proofs. He will be taken back here. Give way. The thief has been brought. - Giri sir ki... - Jai. - Shiny. - Yes. Come if you need Biryani. - Is it mutton? - It is chicken. Biryani is here. - It is a tragedy for Shiny. - All of them are chicken? - I'll adjust with chicken for a day. - There is Biryani for everyone. Giri Sir, here is Biryani for you. No salads? Eat it with pickle. - Everyone got it, no? - Yes. Oh, Salad is here. There is no cholesterol in broiler chicken. Give it to Sir. Here is Biryani for you. Biryani. There is a problem, Maniyan. What problem, Sir? I think he might put us in trouble. What trouble? He is planning to keep all the remaining cases on your head too. He has a change of mind regarding the money that he promised you. This is cheating, Sir. I trusted you like my son. That is why I stood with you. You shouldn't have done this to me. No, my dear. I won't support him for this cheating. I trusted him. My mistake. This is a problem that I created. So, I myself will find a solution for it. Keep it. What is it, Sir? Spare key. I'll tell you how to go about it. Sir. That land dispute is getting worse. Shall I go and check it out? Okay. Sir. Sukumaran Sir is not there. Maniyan has to be taken to one more house for proof collection. I'll manage it myself. Shall I ask Vinod and Chandran to come with you? Okay. What's wrong? Sir, I think my stomach is upset from eating chicken Biryani. Are you employing a trick? My stomach is aching. He wants to go to toilet, it seems. Sir, I want to poop. Where is the toilet? It is over there. Sir. Wait for a minute. Open the cuff for me. Oh, is it not a European closet? No, it is Chinese. Open it fast, Sir. Wait, I'm opening it. You shouldn't lock the door. Open this also, Sir. If so, I can make it fast. You may poop with whatever comfort you have. Go. Sir, are you coming with me? I think he hasn't heard it. There is a way from here. Sir. Sir. Sir, the thief is running away. Don't leave him. Catch him. All of you, move. Move, I say. How do you go to the other side of the river? That way. You need to cross the bridge. Come on. What a useless are you? Lost a thief who was caught by someone else with great difficulty. I guess you got the suspension order. Now, three of you can sit at home for some days. Go. Ask that S.I. to come here. He is calling you, Sir. Vinod, you need not worry. Those who haven't got suspension in the service is very rare. You don't have to take it seriously. He is a born thief. The thief is him or you? If I'm a man, I will catch him. And I will come back here too. Then... We shall play a game together. Sir. As it is a big amount, it is good if you could give me 500 rupee notes. Let me see. The thief caught by you with great difficulty, escaped from the hands of C.I., Isn't it? No, we can't just let him free. We will catch him for sure. I think you are getting married. I asked you, as you are taking a loan for your house renovation. No, nothing like that. Is your dad not at home? He has gone to Tamilnadu. He will be back tomorrow. It has been some days since I saw him. What's up with you, police? All good. How is your mom? - She is a bit down with asthma. - All the notes are that of 500. She doesn't like to go to an hospital. Don't keep the money at home for long, okay? - Why? - Thieves are all around. I don't care. If somebody has to steal my money, he will have to be born again. Isn't it? I think you are right. He must be behind it. That Giri. He is very shrewd. We must somehow catch Maniyan. Let's go and have a look at the way through which he escaped. We will definitely get a clue about where he has escaped. Giri has the habit of wreaking revenge on people. I have had a doubt on him on many occasions. My plan is to stay here itself. I'm not vacating this house for the time being. You must follow Giri all the time. Okay, Sir. We are with you for anything. Don't keep the money at home for long. Thieves are all around. I don't care. If somebody has to steal my money, he will have to be born again. Isn't it? Giri, You? Stop there. Stop, I say. Giri, you thief. Stop there. I'm telling you to stop. Stop there, you thief. Don't think that you have escaped. I understood that you are the thief. Son... I want some hot water. I'm short of breath. Sir. Sir. Sir. Sir. Sir. Yes. What a sleep, Sir? No breakfast, no lunch. At least, drink tea in the evening. Take it. Sir. Here is your tea, Sir. Tea. What do you want for dinner? Sir... Night... food? Food? Nothing. Go. Theft is an intoxication that women or alcohol cannot give. Once you taste it, you must get caught for the intoxication to subside. But for some people, that also is not a deterrent. Son... I want some hot water. I'm short of breath. We were not able to connect you on the phone. Where have you been since yesterday? Park your bike somewhere, and get into the jeep. Sukumaran Sir wants to meet you urgently. Note the measurement correctly. After bringing the body down, check if there is any injury. Okay, Sir. Do you need our guys to get the body down? Giri. Come here. Where have you been? We have been trying to call you since yesterday. Sir... I... was gone... to buy medicines for mom... Who is that? Mom. I don't know them. They are dead Ramaswami's wife and son. Mom. How will I tolerate this, sister? Calm down, please. Giri. Didn't we meet at the bank the previous day? He had been very happy lately. Why would he have committed suicide? Come, mom. - Subhash. - Sir. - Move them away. - Okay, Sir. Call somebody and get the body down. Any two of you come, and hold it. Carefully... Yes, slowly. Okay, you can go. Keep his hands closer. Ramaswami comes to me often. Now, his time is not good. But bad. Are you telling this in the last minute? Couldn't you tell me, if you didn't have money? Go and get it fast. Giri, is it you? This is that rascal. Sreekumar. He is calling me to borrow money. Tell him that I just died. Give him the money. You will get a very good interest. I gave money to somebody for a high interest, and now he is dead. Who is gonna give that money back to me? Gopi, come. Dorai Swami is calling you. Don't delay, come. - So, shall I go? - Yes. Go there, son. Head towards this side. Rotate the body. Slowly. Carefully. Stop running. Giri, stop there. Stop there. I... I'm telling you. You thief, stop there. Don't think that you have escaped. I understood that you are the thief. The subscriber is currently switched off. Please try after sometime. Giri. Who are you looking for? See... that is... That day, he was on leave. I inquired about it. He wasn't even available on the phone. I had seen him going past the check post that night. Maniyan must have been hidden somewhere in Tamilnadu. Thank you, Sir. Sir. I suspect that Giri is behind all the thefts. Most probably, Maniyan would have conducted the theft as per his direction. Why do you suspect that it is a murder? No trace of urine or poop was present in the soil under him. But it was present on the clothes he wore. The death was not from there. He is an elderly person. May be, he had only less discharges. Still, there will be some discharge, no? Moreover, That rope had a mark from dragging it on an iron like metal. And there were tyre marks on the spot. An old rope, no? Marks will be there. It is not an old rope. That is a new one. I feel that, he was murdered before he was hanged. Couldn't you inform that in the department? What's the problem? I feel some change in you. Tell me if anything bothers you. There is no problem that cannot be solved. A day before Swami died... we had met with each other. Okay. It was not just a meeting. In fact... he caught me when I entered his house for stealing. How did you become a police, you thief? I haven't seen a criminal like you in my entire service. I have warned you many times that your habit of wreaking vengeance on people is not good. I'm not able to do it. I'm not able to control myself. What's it, Hubby? What's the problem? Nothing, you go inside. Why is Giri crying? Didn't I ask you to go inside? What's the problem, Giri? Told you to go inside. Sir. I'll confess everything and surrender. Please, Sir. Everything must come to end here. Please... You are not going anywhere. You sleep here today. We need to go somewhere tomorrow. How long have you known him, Pilla? I have known him for the past 2-3 years. This is a little complicated. Here, there is a situation in which he is not able to control his impulses. It is called as Disorder of impulse control. If he feels that anyone is questioning his ego or ability, he takes it as a challenge. And he wants to win the game. Didn't you tell that he goes behind cases and solves it? That is because of the disease. During then, such people will be so daring to face anything. Actually, such an emotion was triggered when he felt the need to humiliate the C.I. But later... that turned out to be a pleasure for him. An immense pleasure. He felt it more challenging than the police job, and he is not getting caught too. He got enslaved to the pleasure of stealing. Now, if he feels that the robber in him is being challenged, his mind would insist him to win by committing a theft. But, he might get caught. And his life will be over then. We can give him counseling. But, If such a situation arises in the real life, that 'no' should come from within him. Which I'm not sure considering his previous personality. Otherwise, there must be something in his real life that could replace his urge. Something that is more challenging... Something that is more thrilling... Given such a situation, sometimes... he might go behind it. The doctor says that you will be okay by this counseling. But you will have to come here a couple of times. You need not go behind the other case. Just to spoil the peace of mind. I cannot just ignore it. I need to know what happened. This is not a case that you will be able to handle. What wonder can an ordinary civil police officer like you do? Let me see if I can do anything with this talent of mine. You are not going to do anything. When the new C.I. takes charge, you will not get time to go behind this case. What if I find something before all that? Didn't I tell you earlier, Sir? When I was running outside, I had felt the presence of a vehicle there. Later, when I went there, the tyre marks that I saw there was similar to the tyre marks that I saw at the spot where the body was hanged. When I was examining it, I received a video message. I called to that number then and there. But it was switched off. He challenged me on my face. I will catch him, Sir. So, that's your decision. Yes. I don't mind losing my job. But I'll catch him before that. Then, I'm also there with you. Swami who ran after me, has not gotten home there after. That's why, even his wife failed to know that I had entered the house. So, he knows you. And he has seen you entering inside the house to steal. He knows me. Moreover, he was there during the funeral ceremony. Did you trace the number from which the video was sent? That is a Tamilnadu number. I have made arrangements for taking the address. Oh, Tamilnadu number, huh? The address could be fake. Weren't you the one who told me that, mobile connections are taken using the ID proofs of the workers who migrate for job? Hey, what's in the postmortem report? There is nothing to be suspected. Symptoms are of death from hanging. I examined the clothes he wore, thoroughly. Discharges are like normal death from hanging. [Sniffing] If you hang from such a big height, naturally, the neck must break. The postmortem report doesn't say so. That means? The doctor is wrong? No, Sir. We had confirmed that it was a suicide before writing the report. Yes. Even I was not in a mental state to think otherwise. The report doesn't say if he had used any object to stand on before hanging, or was he jumping from the top? The doctor hasn't seen the crime scene. May be that is why he didn't think so. Anything else that is unusual? Sir. There was a smell on the clothes that covered the body. I don't know if that is of a perfume, or something else. Did you speak to any of his relatives? Yes. There were family problems. But when he came to the shop yesterday, he was very happy. He said that he was going somewhere, and the problems would get over by the time he was back. When I asked him where he was going, he said that he would tell everything after he came back. He didn't tell anything to mom. When she woke up in the morning, the kitchen door was lying open. Usually, he doesn't go anywhere without telling us. That means, after meeting you, he had gone somewhere without even telling his family. Is it so? Yes, Sir. Swami was going to go somewhere. That is when he saw me, and came after me. Sir, look at this carefully. See this. Towards the end of the video, Swami turns and looks at the vehicle. That means, he has seen the vehicle, and the person who came in the vehicle. After that, he hasn't gone back to his house. What does that mean? May be, that person had come there to pick Swami. What if he had come there not to pick Ramaswami? Then? What if he had been following you? I got it from the side of the forest lane. This has been opened using a key. Anyway, this is a strong evidence. I came to know from the station that one key is missing. I'm sure that Giri gave it to Mani. If we catch Maniyan, we can lock Giri. Chandran has got a clue about Maniyan's hideout place. We will know it in 2 days. I want to put it on his hands. I don't care losing my job after that. Brother, Is Ganapathy Nagar nearby? Are you from Kerala? Why asked? Guessed from your looks. We are Palakkad natives. We are farmers who grow flowers by taking land on lease. Who do you want to meet in Ganapathy Nagar? One Mr. Kakkathoppil Palanivel. Sorry, he passed away. Didn't you know about it? Palanivel's flower business ended up in loss. He had a lot of debts. So, he committed suicide. It has been more than a month since he passed away. He was missing on a fine morning. Next day, we found him hanging on a tree in a compound. This is his number itself. The police told me that his phone was missing on the spot where he was found dead. Even I'd tried calling him a couple of times. But did not connect. Why did he decide to commit suicide all of a sudden? He had some obligations in the flower business. But two days before dying, he had told me that everything had been sorted out. Do what I say. Acting like a detective? Donkey. Who are you to tell me how to investigate the case? I'm the Inspector of this place. You are just an ordinary police. Understand? Yes, Sir. People walk-in just to shoot my pressure up. Get lost. Who are you? I've come to see you. Should I come outside? No. Move. What do you want? Sir, I come from Nedumpara Station. I want some details regarding a murder case. What is this? In the Kerala Police, are the murder cases investigated by civil police officers? Letter? Take out S.P.'s official letter. Sir. The official letter has not been issued. Then, how will I know who you are? Ask them to call me. Sir, I need the details unofficially. Unofficially? What is your rank? What is my rank? You are an ordinary P.C. Am I sitting here to give you the details that you ask for? Out. Get out. One tea. Sir. I'm Giri Shankar. CPO, Kerala Police. At Nedumpara station. Both of us are alike. Same rank, same (terrible) situation. Senthil Kumar, Constable. I've come to Nedumpara to catch a thief. Before... We also have a similar inspector in our station. Such an egoistic person. He always makes fun of us. He is under suspension now, sitting at home. Tea or coffee for you, Sir? - Coffee. - Brother. Get him a super coffee. Okay. Where in this place have you come to? I'm here as a part of an investigation, but felt a connection here. It's when I asked for its details that he drove me away. He is a fool. If we solve a case, his ego will be hurt. Then, he would call us names. The situation is the same everywhere. Talented people don't have ranks. Those who have ranks are not talented either. What do you want, Sir? I can help if possible. I'll whatsapp the details of Palanivel's death available in the station. I'll collect the details of similar cases, if there is any. What you said is right. If we pick somebody working in the hospital, we can check if there is any similar cases of death reported in the nearby stations. I'll look into it. Sir. - What's it, Sir? - Nothing. Dead bodies are brought here from 7 stations. Details about the people who died from hanging in the past 1 year is there in this. I'll give you the details of the old ones too. But it will take some time. This address is in Kerala border. See this? Oh, is it you? Why are you here? Take your hands off me, Sir. - Why are you following me? - How funny! I'm supposed to ask that question to you. Why did you come here, Sir? Isn't it to catch me? Not to catch you. Lies! Hey, Maniyan. You smoked me out of my place. And now from here. I lost my peace. You will cheat me. I know that. Believe me, Maniyan. Believe you? You are a bigger thief than me. Weren't you the one who committed all those thefts? Hey. Weren't you the one who removed the window pane of the toilet I used the other day? I understood it back then, that you were taking revenge on that Circle inspector, like I did to Hitler Mathan. Don't try to cook up stories. I'm happy, Sir. I'm happy that you taught C.I. a lesson. Hey, stop there. No, Sir. Hey, I helped you to escape from the jail, no? Then, why should I try to catch you? Whatever it is, you are a police, no? Policemen cannot be trusted in life. Do you know that? Stop committing theft, okay? If you continue it, you won't be able to get out of it. Maniyan. Get lost, Sir. He has come with new stories just to put others in trouble. Sir... Shiny. Go through this file. We need to give a report to S.I. Sir. Giri. Last 3 years' files are there. I give this because it is you who asked for it. Don't show it to anybody. Return it immediately after going through it. Hey. Why are you loitering in the hospital compound? Is your friend, that thief here? Or have you started kidney trade together? Why are you talking like this, Sir? I'm on duty. I'm busy. Don't go like that. Let's have a lil-chat and then go. Take your hands off me. Where did you hide Maniyan? I'm a police officer on duty. If you interrupt my duty, you will meet the consequences. Who are you going to lock with all these? Tell me. You may go now. Don't think that you have escaped from me. I'm getting the updates of where you are going, and who you are meeting. A lot of such murders have occurred in Tamilnadu. All of them are under the jurisdiction of police stations near ours. So, are you saying that the hangings reported during my service also belong to this? Some of them... It has occurred in the jurisdiction of the station next to us. I went to the hospital and collected the details. New yellow plastic ropes have been used in all the cases. These are murders. Murders that have similar traits. Who would be the murderer? What would be the motive behind killing these many people? All of them who died have crossed middle age. There are no youngsters. According to the information received so far, there are no back to back deaths. There is actually a one month gap between them. Another thing I noticed is, All of them have some problems in life that people will believe that they would commit suicide. That means, the murderer knows them in some manner. Yes, Sir. Its without even telling their family, that all of them have gone outside at night. And their dead bodies were seen on the next day. May be they were taken by people they know. There have been no thefts. No, Sir. Theft is not their intention. I cross checked it. Another thing is, All of them who have been murdered belong to upper caste. Giri. The situation is more dangerous than we thought. We can deal with the consequences later. We must inform the department. You won't be able to handle it all alone. Why do you say so? It's not a big deal as you say. Do you see this? He sent me one more video last day. And a threatening message that says, 'Don't come on my way.' 'You will be over'. If we inform this in the department, he will flash the video. Everybody will believe that these are cooked up stories to cover my act. That's the end of me. And he will escape. If so, it is better to play, and then end. Anyway, one thing is clear. We are moving on the right path. When does a person threaten someone? When he loses all of his courage. He has been shaken. I'm sure about it. Hey. You must be careful. He is a dangerous criminal. A daring criminal. Shaji... Make sure that the people don't bite the dog. I don't think that the thief will be caught. Everybody should take care of their own belongings. What is the use of police? No use at all. So, I bought a dog. Bro, thieves are stealing from houses where there are dogs. It is not a flimsy dog that you see here. - It is a different breed. - What breed is it? Which breed is it? Belgium Maldives. Yes, Belgium Maldives. A dog crossbred from two different countries. Moreover, it has got special training in catching robbers. If so, install a CCTV, Thambi. Shaji. Go and take my purse from the vehicle. If the thief is wearing a mask, what is the use of CCTV? Alas! Thambi... Thambi... See that. See the dog barking. How is it? Can a CCTV do it? If any thief come to my house premises, this dog will bite off his crucial body parts. How to deal with dogs... Everybody gives chicken and beef to the dogs. Before I go enter houses where there are dogs, I buy some mutton. Tender mutton. There is a recipe suggested by my Guru. An awesome recipe. Mix fried groundnuts with some honey, grind it, and marinate the mutton for 2-3 hours. When you give this to the dogs, not just dogs, even tigers will come to where ever we call them. How is it? Senthil, good evening. I was going to call you. Good evening, Sir. I've got the details of all the murders in the past 3 years. Oh! In 2021, there has been a murder every month. - Really? - Yes, almost after every 30 days. But in 2020 and this year, it was not the case. Okay. Senthil, do one thing. Whatsapp the details. - I'll call you. - Okay, Sir. Alright. Human beings lock money and gold inside the draw, and sleep. Like a demon guarding the treasure. When I see it, my muscles roll up. The excitement of stealing at that point of time cannot be felt in a house where there is no one. Hey, get up. Your phone has been ringing. It might be an urgent call. Get up, dear. Can you get me the phone, mom? Here it is. Take it. I've prepared tea for you. Get up and come. Giri, S.I. Sir has asked you to come here urgently. A dead body has been recovered. Body? Somebody is dead there. Come on. Dead? Where is it? Don't know whose body is it. Let's go and see. What is the mark on the hand? Any wound behind the neck? Don't we have to list the ornaments? Yes. Is she the one who is working in Shakthi's finance? Yes, Comrade. It has been some days since her husband left her. She had an affair with Shakthi. Really? Perhaps, she fell down while she was going to meet him at night. This is a dark pathway. Today is a new moon day. Yesterday night would have been so dark. Take a picture of the face. Sir, her head has been beaten up. We need to examine it. Shall we take the body over there? Okay. Hold her carefully. Lay her there. Hold the leg. Lay her straight. Hello. The information is correct. When Thambi's house was looted, some people in the colony had received money. They said that somebody came in a bike and threw money at them. So, it is sure that money is not what the thief wants. It is him. Giri. Let the game tighten. When I get hold of the joker, I'll tear off his card. The lady who was murdered, and Shakthi had an illegal relationship with each other. A day before the incident, they have had a fight too. So, it's natural to suspect Shakthi. That's not true. He is innocent. I'm sure about it. Shakthi is a thin guy. But this is a person who is fat in nature. I have seen him. Only that his face wasn't clear. As it was just a day before the new moon, it was all dark. But, no murders look similar to this one. What's it? One minute, Sir. What's it? Don't talk. Just a minute. Sir, come. Sir, do you see this? In 2020, no murders have occurred in Kerala. But, it has occurred in every month in Tamilnadu. In 2020 and this year, a month with no murder in Tamilnadu, is a month with a murder in Kerala. According to the information that we received, there had been a series of murder in every month, from 2020 until now. Either in Tamilnadu or in Kerala. Moreover, all the murders have occurred on the new moon day. The person will be taken the day before, and his dead body will be hung on the tree, on the very next day morning of Amavasya (new moon). May be, this lady was taken in the same manner. When she tried to escape, killed her hitting on her head. But... On the day of new moon, people belonging to certain tribe, that too, people who have reasons to commit suicide, are being killed. The dead bodies have a special smell on it. What is behind all these? Will it be any black magic or something? No way. In this century? Don't rule out the possibility of black magic. Superstitious beliefs of human beings are increasing day by day. Haven't you heard of Burari case that happened in Delhi recently? 11 people from a family committed suicide. Believing that they will be born again. Human sacrifices are happening even in Kerala, that is no. 1 in literacy. When I started my service in Kanjiramkulam station, A black magician convinced the people that if a small kid was sacrificed on the new moon day, they would find treasure. A lot of people together killed a kid. This too could be something like that. I don't think so. But I told you, no? 2020 onwards, murders have been occurring every month. If it is a gang behind it, keeping it as a secret for such a long period, is not possible. If it is something like you said, it must be one person behind all the murders. But, how can one person kill these many people all alone? But serial killers do it alone, no? How will you go behind this case in between your duty? I tell lies to Sukumaran Sir, and scoot. Otherwise, I take leaves. If you had support from the police station, you could work more freely. I feel that you must open up everything to Sukumaran. We can trust him. He will not cheat. Before the situation get worse, we can say that Shakthi is innocent. Okay. We will do that. Anyway, Harilal Sir and Vinod are following me. Before they find something and inform Sukumaran Sir, it's better that I confess to him. Your phone is ringing. Yes, Subash. When? Tell me. Tell me the truth. Sir. I'll make you vomit breast milk. Tell me the truth. Enough! Move! Move, I say. Tell me the truth. If you get more thrashings, you will die. Better tell me the truth. Who gave you the key of the handcuff? Tell me. - Tell me. - I'll tell you, Sir. Ask them not to thrash me. I'll tell you the truth. Go on. Before I was taken for collecting proofs, amidst the rush of people who had gathered during the time when Sirs had gone outside to control the crowd, I stole the key that had been hung on that wall. It is using that key, I unlocked the handcuff. That day, this Sir caught me all alone. The Sirs who caught me yesterday asked me, to tell that, that Sir helped me to escape the other day. Telling lies, you bloody? No Sir, he will die. No, Sir, don't thrash him. He is telling lies. - Get out. - Stand properly, Maniyan. Maniyan. Why didn't you show me to them? There is no cheating in cheating. A true thief only steals. He doesn't cheat anyone. I forgot to tell that to you, Sir. I like you, Sir. You are a very good police officer. Please forgive me, Maniyan. You will not have to go to jail because of me. I promise you. Sukumaran, Instead of being stunned, tell us something. What shall I tell, Sir? This is like listening to a film story. This is my request. You must stand with Giri. If the case are solved, the credit is yours. Sir, We have confirmed that Shakthi was in Bangalore that night. Okay. Told you, no? He is not the culprit. Sir. The police had found the handbag of the lady who was killed. There was a chit that mentioned something about a Puja. Sir. [Sniffing] Sir. Let me see. I searched all over the place. I didn't find any such prescriptions. My father had performed Puja for escaping from debt. He never told us about what it was. Everything was done secretly. It was inside the draw. He never told me about performing any Puja. But... But he had been fasting for a long time. After fighting with my bro-in-law, my sister had been living with me for some time. The day before my sister died, I heard some noise early in the morning. I got up to see what it was. She was in a hurry to go somewhere. I asked her where she was going. She told that she is going to an auspicious place, and would tell me about it after coming back. But later... Was there any problem before the incident? Look at me. Was there any problem? Nothing like that. Tell me if you remember anything. Sir, that is... Thiruchendoor Madam. No, you should not keep it there. Keep it that side. Swamiji, someone has come to meet you. I'm Giri Shankar. CPO of Nedumpara police station. I can see struggle on your face. What do you want to know about? Swami, Can you tell me what are all these Pujas for? Do you teach these here? Are the people who have performed these Pujas still alive? No. Everybody has been murdered. These rituals are not taught in here, or in any other places that teach Tantras. The Yagnas and sacrifices stipulated in this chit, belong to the ancient evil rituals of consuming souls. In the Hindu Tradition in India, these are evil rituals. Sorry, Swami. I do not understand what you are saying. There are some evil rituals that came all the way from Tibet, and spread in India, especially among the people of Vanga, and North India. This is one among them. A person is prepared to leave his body, after doing certain Pujas and rituals, and during the new moon day, he is lead towards death. They believe that, such souls could be embraced, and through it, they can attain immortality and supernatural powers. A regressive and cruel belief. Is there anyone who perform such rituals now? A person with a sound mind will not do so. But there are certain people who doesn't have a sound mind. People who have strange behavior by birth. The science of Tantras say that, they are depended on the past Karmas. But psychartists call it as psychoneurosis, psychosis etc. Swami, Is it in a special place or in a temple, that these rituals are being conducted? Before, such evil rituals were there among the tribals. I have heard that such a temple was there in the Kerala-Tamilnadu border, inside the forests. Such rituals were performed by transgenders who were born in Vasu Panchaka Panchami. As a consequence of concerted efforts of our preachers, they stopped performing evil rituals. But I slightly remember the ritual of taking a lamp into the place, once in an year, and that was continued for many years. It is said that the place was destroyed in a land slide. There was a book in our library that marked the route map to reach that place. But that went missing after a problem that occurred here. Earlier, a student who came here for learning Tantras, was caught red handed for performing Pujas at the grave yard, in a female costume. It was a very strange explanation that we got from him. According to Tantric science, out of the 10 pranas, (breath) the last prana to leave our body is Dhananjaya Prana. When the dead body burns in the pyre, due to the explosion of bones on the waist, Dhananjayan will go out, and the Prana (life force) that is being sacrificed will enter another body. But he says that he can receive that Prana into his own body, and can become immortal through the act. Didn't I tell you about people with strange behavior? He is such a person. After he left, we noticed that, the book was missing. Do you remember his name, or any other details? No. This is an incident that occurred years back. There after, I haven't heard of him anymore. Haven't you gone somewhere and studied Tantric rituals? So, you must be able to understand these by reading them. What are these rituals all about? I don't know anything about it. Don't you suggest such rituals yourself? This is Tamil. I don't know Tamil much. Let me see. Towards the end of it, it is speaking about Kabbala sacrifice. It is a special Puja conducted somewhere in Tamilnadu. Somebody has told me about it. Who is that? Yes, our Manoharan. Our Dorai Swami knows about it. He is the one who told about it to me. He is here to perform a Puja for Lakshmi. Let's ask him right away. Swami is here. Swami. He is Giri. He is a police officer of this station. Where are these Pujas happening, did you say? In a temple deep inside the forests of Tamilnadu. Deep inside means? I don't know about it. I'm leaving. Okay. - Manohar. - Yes. I want to know something about a case from him. - Come with me. - No problem. Swami. You know, Giri wants to know something from you. I want you to predict something regarding a case. Sorry, I'm really busy. Please don't say no. Giri is very close to me. Okay, I agree as Manoharan insisted. Got it? Come to my house. Predictions are done only from there. Everyone in our place go to Swami's house for predictions. I'll also go. Will you give me your mobile number? 384186. But, This number was given to me by someone else as your number. This is not my number. Oh! Okay, Swami. Yes, Sir. Giri. You received the video not from the phone that contain. Karup Dorai's number that you gave. Its IMI number is different. Is it? Yes. What if he has two numbers? That's possible. I really suspect Dorai. Anyway, I'm going to meet him. Okay, then. This case has been a headache for us, for a long time. You must help us, Swami. This is for the first time, a policeman is approaching me for help. You will not have to be disappointed. They are not deaths. Death is when the time takes the soul into the hands of death. But these souls that left the body before the time, hasn't reached death. This is a sacrifice. And not death. Souls leaving the body before time, is either suicide, or murder. For us, both are crimes. Investigation will take place. That is how ordinary people think. Even the Goddess hasn't killed the demons. But she removed the evil from them, and made them a part of her. In the world of ordinary people, only their laws are executed. Pure souls could be identified by enlightened people. When he seeks immortality by consuming the soul, even the soul becomes immortal. The silly laws made by the ordinary humanbeings are irrelavant amidst the process that has been there since the beginning of the universe. Swami. I'm a police officer. For me, and my department, these are murders committed by a psychopath. We will find the culprit. And we will give the punishment that he deserves. Okay? Good. I've already told you about what appeared in my vision. I don't see anything more than than this. So, nothing more to say. What foolishness have you done? Why did you talk to him as if you suspect him? Now then, he wouldn't move. Dear Sir, If I'm right, he is like me. If you challenge him, that will hurt his ego. So, he will definitely go behind it. It is just a day more for the new moon. I'm going to stay here itself. I want to follow him. Sir, Sukumaran Sir is calling me. - Let me pick his call. - Okay. Yes, Sir. Hey, Giri... I got a call from the cyber cell. Karup Dorai's second number has been switched on in this area. In the jurisdiction of our station? How is that possible? I haven't moved from here. He hasn't gone outside either. Then, how would his phone be switched on, in our jurisdiction? Anyway, it has been switched on here. Giri, Your calculation has gone wrong somewhere. The subscriber is currently switched off. Please try after sometime. Sir, I haven't gone wrong. He himself is the culprit. He is not here. We want to find where he is taking people to. I'm going to the Madam. Will you go and speak to Manoharan? He must know something about it. Okay, Sir. This is not needed. - We will file another one. - Okay, Sir. Sukumaran Sir. I'm Manoharan. Saw your missed calls. What's the matter, Sir? Where were you? I've been trying to get you since yesterday. Sir, I was gone to a temple with my family. There was no range there. Now, I'm about to reach my home. Okay. Come to the station immediately. It is urgent. I don't have a clear idea about the way to the temple. The temple of the tribes is somewhere deep inside of the forests of Kottakudi Hills. May be, if you ask any elderly forest officer, you can identify the way. I'm sure that the temple is in the forest of Kottakudi Hills. On the day the lady died, his vehicle was parked on the way to the hills. Swamiji told that we can identify the way if we ask any elderly forest officer. I know a person who worked in the forest department in that area. He has retired. Sir, do one thing. Give me his address and phone number. I'll go and meet him. Okay. Long back, this was a place where human sacrifices were conducted. It was the then tribal head who told me that there was such a temple deep inside the forest of Kottakudi hills. But the place was destroyed in a land slide long back. Sir. I want to locate the place in connection with the investigation of a very important case. Can you help me in any manner? Let me see. I've got an old map belonging to the forest department. Using that, I'll tell you an approximate location of the place. Hello, Sukumaran Sir. Sir, if the map showed by the range officer is right, I've reached his spot. Giri, there is a bad news. What? Bad news? He has taken Manoharan's daughter for some Puja. Sir. La... Lakshmi? Yes. Hello. - Hello. - Hello. Hello, Sir. Hello. Shucks! There is no range. Lakshmi... Too bad. Not able to connect him. Lakshmi. Lakshmi. Hey, Lakshmi. Lakshmi. Hey, Lakshmi. Lakshmi. You will be hanged tomorrow. I'll send the video of you going to steal, to everyone. Untie me. The people will say that, you committed suicide out of the humiliation of getting caught. Lakshmi. These are the sacrifices that empower a transsexual humanbeing like her, to win the universe, and to defeat death, that is normally not possible for an ordinary humanbeing. Your classmate Lakshmi just passed this way. Her family is conducting a lot of Pujas, and offerings to the Lord. Still, she is not getting a good marriage alliance. Transgenders who were born in Vasu Panchaka Pamnchami were the people who performed such rituals. Giri. The video that you received was not sent from the phone, that contain Karup Dorai's number, that you gave. Giri. Who are you looking for? Our relatives scorned us saying that a transgender kid was a curse to the family. So, we moved from that place to here. When Dorai Swami told that we needed to conduct a Puja inorder to remove the bane, I ageed to it, thinking about her good future. Initially, I used to go along with her for the Puja. But later, she insisted on not going with her. And she started going alone. Where was the Puja? At Dorai Swami's house. Hasn't you daughter ever told you about this place? We thought that she was going to Dorai Swami's house for Puja. But... I don't believe that my daughter will support such cruelty. Certain people have the ability to brainwash normal people and make them believe superstition. Dorai Swami is such a kind of person. [Chanting prayers for the destruction of the enemy] Lakshmi. Lakshmi. No. Please believe me. He is using you. No. No. No. No. Lakshmi. Lakshmi. Lakshmi. Lakshmi. Lakshmi. After a few months. Lakshmi, who had been a prey to black magic and superstition, is coming back to normalcy. The doctors informed the court. Lakshmi, who had born as a transgender was apprehensive about her mental and physical states. It is the humiliation and isolation that she had to suffer right from her childhood, that brought Lakshmi close to Karup Durai who is a black magician, and a friend of his father. Karup Dorai convinced Lakshmi that her birth is so special, that she is capable of imbibing supernatural powers. That's how he had Lakshmi partenered in his evil activities. When you analyse it, it is Manoharan's superstitious beliefs that pushed Lakshmi into trouble. Can't believe that superstition still exists in this century. Isn't it? You cannot generalize everything as superstition. There are some truths behind it. Pillechan, Is Giri here? No, he hasn't come here today. May be, he is on duty. If he is there at the station, why should we ask you? Hello, Sir. - Is Giri inside? - He has not woken up yet. - Oh. - Hey, Giri. Giri, the Sirs have come. He got home very late last night. You need not get tense. We are here with a good news. What is it, Sir? Crime Branch's special investigation team, SIT has taken you in their team. What? Yes. Posting is in Thiruvananthapuram. Is it difficult to believe? Here it is. Look! Sir. Got a call from the station. A thief entered Aiswarya Nerurkar's house last night.
