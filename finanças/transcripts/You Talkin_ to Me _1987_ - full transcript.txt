[♪♪♪] ROBERT DE NIRO [IN MOVIE]: Listen, you fuckers, you screwheads. Here is a man who would not take it anymore. A man who stood up against the scum, dogs, filth, shit. Here is a man who stood up. Eh, eh? Try it, you f... You talkin' to me? You talkin' to me? You talkin' to me? Well, who the hell else are you talkin' to? You talkin' to me? I'm the only one here. Who the fuck do you think you're talkin' to? Oh, yeah? Okay... huh? MAN: Oh! [AUDIENCE GRUMBLING] Boo! MAN [ON MIC]: We are sorry, but our projector has broken down. You can collect your refunds on the way out. The next screening ofTaxi Driver will be tomorrow evening. Ah, shit. Bronson, let's go, man. Hey, Bronson. Hey, hey, Bronson, ha, hey, you, hey. Hey, man, Bronson. Oh.Let's get out of here. Come on, dude. Come on, come on, come on. You okay?Yeah. [SIREN WAILING] Man, what I'd give for a chance to act like that, huh? To totally transcend into a character. How many times have you seen this now? Twenty, thirty times. [CHUCKLING] Still fresh though. It's amazing. So you're really leaving tomorrow, huh? I'm just not making it here as a model, you know that? So I figure I'll go try the coast and that way, I'll know whether or not to give it up before I try the real world. I hear you. Just gonna miss my main man, though. Why don't you come with me, Bronson? You don't quit, do you? We've been through this, Thatcher. I just can't. Bronson, look at yourself, man. You're a New York actor in a city that's filled with New York actors. Why not try L.A.? Hey, hey, you, you. I swallowed my New York pride. That shit didn't taste that bad. I'll bet it didn't. Stay away from them surf ponies, man. They got no brains. [♪♪♪] BRONSON: Ever since I can remember, people have always asked me why I wanted to be an actor. At first I told them the real reason. Invariably, they'd laugh. So eventually I learned to lie. I would smile and say, "Acting was glamorous and beat working for a living." And this, everyone understood. Then when people in the business asked, I would tell 'em it was a unique emotional outlet for my creative impulse. And they would nod, pretend to be intelligent, and say they understood. De Niro understands the real reason. It's that moment. That moment when the acting stops and the second life begins. That moment when men become heroes. That moment. That moment. Hey, Bobby. What do you think about moving to L.A.? [♪♪♪] [PHONE RINGING] Hi, you've reached Bronson Green. Listen, I'm not in right now. If you leave your name and number, I'll get back to you as soon as I can. Bye-bye. [MESSAGE BEEPING] THATCHER: Yo, Bronson. It's your homeboy, Thatcher. I got some news for you, serious big news, buddy. Call me. I'm tellin' you, call me. I'm gonna go hang out at the beach, work on my tan, find me some cuties, yo, yo, yo. If you still want me to bring Judith to you, just leave a message on my box, I'll come by, whatever. Either way, I'll see you later. Later. [MESSAGE BEEPING] Hi, Bronson. It's me, Judith. Listen, baby, something's come up at the studio and I'm not gonna get to see you before the play tonight. But I'm meeting Thatcher in front of the theater and I promise, promise, promise I won't be late. After the play, you and me, celebrate, [CLICKING TONGUE] you know what I mean? You're the sexiest actor in this town. I love you, I love you, I love you. Break a leg, bye. [♪♪♪] Okay, Bobby, hold down the fort. See you later. AGENT: Are you ready? Let's hear it then. So there you are. I've been waiting for you. Hold it. Hold it, you're all wrong. Too New York. I didn't even get by the first line. I can tell by your looks. Too New York. Aren't you gonna let me read the rest? What for? You're all wrong. Too New York. Why should I hire you? I hate your type of acting. [CHUCKLES] You've got to be kidding me. No. No! [LAUGHING] No! MARTY: No. BRONSON: Now, come on, Marty, huh? All I'm asking is a couple of nights a week off so I can do this play. MARTY [ON RADIO]: Hey, Olivier, I got a great idea. Why not quit driving the cab and use the money from the play to pay your goddamn rent? BRONSON: 'Cause I don't get paid for doing the play, Marty. MARTY: You don't get paid? Are you kiddin' me? Listen, Bronson, the schedule stands the way it is, so forget about it. Just deal with it. Hey, sorry, buddy, I got a pick-up here already. I'm your pick-up. Okay, you didn't have to sneak up on me. My limo got lost. And I don't want anybody in this town seeing me in a cab. Hey, wake up, kid, this is L.A. Where to? Drop me one block from the Beverly Wilshire Hotel. I can't wait to get my hands on that limousine service. Hey, wait a minute. Yeah, I know who you are. Didn't you used to be Alan King? Yeah, used to be. [LAUGHING] Yeah. Alan King, in my cab. I'll be damned. I'm Bronson Green, I'm an actor, and I'd do some wonders for your films. Hey, there's my pictures back here. Go ahead, take one. Go ahead, here. Alan King, hah! Hey, Mr. King, hold on, watch this, watch this. [TIRES SCREECHING] Hold on a minute, here we go. [IN DE NIRO'S VOICE] Listen, you fuckers, you screwheads. Here is a man who would not take it anymore. A man who stood up against the scum, the dogs, and the filth. Here is a man who stood up. What do you think, Mr. King, huh? Hire me? Swell. BRONSON: Hey, Mr. King. Hey! Hey, wait a minute, Mr. King? Hey, wait, how about a picture? Hey, hey, at least pay your fare. MARTY: 1320. Hey! Hey, Olivier, pick up your radio. Look, don't give me any grief, I know you're out there. Pick up your goddamn radio right now, would you, please? Hold your horses, Marty, I'm here. You got a call from Poland somebody. Marion Poland, 204-0474. He says it's important, you should give him a call. Poland? Poland? Holy shit. Yo, dispatch, I need that number again. Marty, repeat. Repeat that number, please. Are you deaf? 204-0474. Got it, thanks. RECEPTIONIST: Sorry, she can't get here by 2:15, she's history. Hi.Are you the messenger? No. I'm Bronson Green. So? I'm here for the callback. There's been a mistake. You're the wrong type. What do you mean, the wrong type? I'm an actor. I do types. We're only hiring blonds now. Look, lady, I can play a blond better than any of these clowns here. Look, get real. This is the '80s. Your type of acting is dead. We're not interested in Hoffman, De Niro, Pacino types anymore. Like, I have some packages for you. Could you wait a minute? Sure. There's somebody here I want you to see. What's up, dude? Just trying to get some work. Yeah, life's a bitch. But at least it doesn't snow here. POLAND: Tell 'im I'll call his agent. Yeah, I'll be right back. The hunk standing next to the desk. Can you talk to me? Sure, dude, what do you need to know? Fantastic. Where did you find him? Are you his agent? Uh, no. I'm Bronson Green. I'm here for the role. [LAUGHING] Well, I'm sorry. It's already cast. What, like, me?POLAND: Yes, you. Listen, son, are you an actor? Sure, why not? Come along with me. We've got things to talk about. I don't think I need to see anyone else today, all right? You got it, boss. Come along, son. Let's party.What? MARTY [ON RADIO]: Hey, Mr. Hollywood, I got an important pick-up for you. Mr. Irwin at 8899 Carson Street, okay? Don't screw this up. Bronson? Bronson? Are you there? Christ, Bronson, come on already. Where the hell are you? Goddamn it. [♪♪♪] [MOANING] What's going on in here? Hey, don't you realize that 15 people died last year in bizarre sexual accidents? GIRL: Oh. Huh? [LAUGHING] What's going on, buddy. I don't know, man. I'm just-- Yeah, yeah, I bet you are. [LAUGHING] What are you doing here? Oh, man. I'm so pissed off. I go to a callback and I get to the callback and they hire some schmuck messenger who's delivering a script. Thatcher, I tell you, nobody wants an actor anymore. They just want a look. [EXHALES] Welcome to the music video age, man. Ah. A new low in American culture. Thatcher, I thought you said we were gonna be alone? Man, who is this anyway? Just some chick who wants to find out about the mystique. Oh, mystique, my ass. Oh, yeah? You want to see something? Ah, no, I don't want to see something. Wait a minute, man. I think I'm gonna put this up. This is something you got to see. Well, Thatcher, I ain't gonna look, so keep it in there. I don't believe it. You didn't? I did, I did, I did! I don't believe it.Ha, believe it, buddy, 'cause next week your friend's gonna be in every newspaper in the country. You're fast. Congratulations! [LAUGHING] Oh, man. Oh, man, it's just... it's too wild, man. They're talkin' about goin' national and everything. Big bucks, man. Big bucks. Get out of here. I can't take that. Look, man, take this. Man, I'll pay you back. [LAUGHING] I know you will. Just remember, man, things may be goin' a little rough for you now, a little crazy even. But, hey, you still got the play, right? Yeah. We showcase tonight. Bunch of agents, casting people coming down. I'll give 'em a performance they won't forget. [LAUGHING] That's right. [APPLAUSE] [♪♪♪] Oh, bad. God, I was so bad. You've always been bad. Damn you, Bronson. The hell were you tryin' to pull out there? It's called acting, Ted, in case you don't know the word. I think it's called trying to bring attention to yourself. Get off it, Ted, huh? You've been trying to bring attention to yourself your whole life. All right, everybody, I'm gonna let the industry people backstage. Good luck. Ted Walthrope, that was brilliant. Come here. Come on. Come here. That was magnificent. Fabulous, fabulous. [CLEARING THROAT] Hi, I'm Bronson Green, co-star of the play. What an asshole. Bitch. AGENT: Hey, that's Judith Margolis. Judith. Hey, baby. How's it goin'? Ah, swell. Look at this garbage. Forget it. Tough goin', huh, man? Well, I'm gonna take off. All right, goin'? Yeah. Thanks for coming down.Hey, you were good, man. You think so?You were breathtaking. This shit is breathtaking. Tell him.Takes my breath away. Hey! See you tomorrow. Bye, Thatcher. I can't believe this. Come on, let's get out of this place. Judith Margolis. Let's do lunch. I got a package for you, big... Come here, let's talk. Come on, now. Bronson, one minute. One minute, I promise you. Tell me your name once-- right, I can't really-- it was a party, wasn't it? Right, right, I did. Hi, hi, haven't seen you in a long time. It was a pleasure working with you. Ted, happy to meet you.TED: Nice to see you. Bronson tells me you're a joy to work with. Yes, thank you, I am. Thank you very much. So what's been going on? Bronson... you're fired. Say, what? Well, I just got the word, the producers say they want to go with somebody more subtle. What are you talking, more subtle. Well, more blond. They said Ted would look better with a blond co-star. Blond? What do you guys want, man? An actor or a blond? You're neither. I mean, face it, they just don't want you. Man, what's going on around here? What are you looking at, huh? You did your job. Get the hell out of here, you're making me sick. For fast-acting relief, try slowing down. Goddamn it. Shit! [DOOR OPENS] JUDITH: Okay, okay. Next week, lunch, I promise. Where you been, Judith? I've been inside. Where do you think? I've been waiting for you 20 minutes out here and I'm pissed off. There are people in there that I work with every single day. I couldn't just walk out. Why not? Did you come down here tonight for me or for yourself? Baby, where do you get off taking this attitude? You're acting like an upset little child. I'm not upset. Just 'cause my whole life's been turned upside down today, I am not upset. No, not me. Bronson, we've been goin' out for three months now and, in many ways, I enjoy you thoroughly, but your struggling actor routine is beginning to get a little old. Old? I'll tell you what's getting old. Agents' executives like you flocking around that asshole, Ted Walthrope. All you know how to do is to market a style, you sell a look. What do you know about acting, Judith, huh? Don't turn your personal failure into general outrage. We happen to give people what they want. Has it ever occurred to you that maybe nobody's in the market for a mirror-kissing De Niro clone? Oh, so that's it? Well, it's nice to know how you feel, Judith. Bronson, you know I don't mean that. Don't touch me, Judith. Why don't you go make one of your music video movies. Oh, I'm sick of this shit, I'm goin' home. Bronson. I wish the play had gone better for you tonight. Give me a break, you know I love you. Judith, you love money. You love power. You love getting laid. You got your money, you got your power, now find someone else to fuck you. [♪♪♪] That's right. That's right, man, I don't need them. I don't need them, man. That's right. [MOUTHS WORDS] That's right. [BROKEN SOBBING] That's right. [SIGHING] Stop fucking crying. That's right, man. Excuse me, can you tell me which way Malibu Beach is? Oh, the 'bu? Outrageous choice, dude. You're talking primo sure spa here. Do yourself a cutback. Head towards the rays, then ride the PCH till the vibes are right. Exit-o. No prob. Young man, are you aware of the fact that you are absolutely out of your mind? Hey, dude, I live in L.A. Hey, hey, hey, yo, yo, big booty. Hey, girl. Hello, ha, ha! Ooh! [LAUGHING] Ha, ha, wow! Awesome mode of transport, dude. Yeah, my buddy drives this, man. Crazy. Bitchin' day, eh? So, like, what's the scoop being associated with the moo cow biz? You, aghh! Bronson, you lost your mind, man. Yes, but I've found my soul. [LAUGHING] Listen, man, are you stoned? No, just blond. What do you think? [LAUGHING] Let me ask you a question, man. Why in the hell did you do this? Oh, hell. Got nothing left to lose, Thatch, you got everything to gain. Did you do this to get back in the play? No, to hell with the play. Did it for myself. Hell, look, De Niro, he gained 60 pounds for "Raging Bull." Yeah? He learned to play the sax for "New York, New York." Compared to that, me dyeing my hair blond is nothing. [LAUGHING] But you? Blond? [LAUGHING] I just may be the first pretty boy with street smarts. [CONTINUES LAUGHING] I may be blond, Thatch, but you remember where I come from. Man, you came from a planet that's far, far away, man. There's no doubt to it. Hey, dude, when in L.A., get as weird as the locals, man. [♪♪♪] MARTY: Hey, 1320, yo, Bronson, man, you really let me down again today leaving Mr. Herbert all alone like that. I got a pick-up for you at 801 West Temple. Go get 'im, Bronson. [♪♪♪] Need some help, dude? Yeah. I'm, like, scoping on these boards here. Now that's a fine choice right there. That's the latest in surf technology. It's light as a feather yet hard as a rock. Go ahead, hit the deck. Dude? Dude? Oh, yeah, awesome. Feel the strength of the fiberglass construction. Notice the fine curvature of the rails. And, of course, the curved bottom contour for increased maneuverability. And check out this scoop. We have our own shapers right here in L.A. We custom build our surf boards, especially designed for California waves. Shit. We don't sell shit here. Only the best. Hey, but if you don't like this one, we've got plenty of 'em here on the rack that I'm sure will amaze you. So what are you looking for anyway? Do you want a thruster, a quad, longboard? Ah, a thruster, definitely. [SHOP DOOR BELL SOUNDS] Check this one out. This is a hold-up. Hold-up? What do you mean, hold-up? Clean out that cash register now. Hey, give me the money now, huh? Hey, lady. WOMAN: No way. Now look at you. This is no time for a-- look. Come on, please. Freeze, dude. One false move, you're circumcised. Please, don't hurt me. Well, I'm calling the police. What kind of gun is this? A cap gun. You're trying to rob the store with a cap gun, dude? I can't afford a real gun. Look, supply-side economics is destroying my life. I've got no liquid assets, my cash flow is negligible. I'm sorry, I just... I've never done this before. Gripless.WOMAN: I would like for you to get over here as soon as you can. Okay, come on. Put your hands behind your back. Ah, do you have to tie him up? Look at him. Are you joking? The dude does have a major grief factor going here. Whose side are you guys on anyway? WOMAN: Yes, sir. You can't escape, the police are coming. Hey! Hey, wait a minute. What's going on here? Who are the two of you anyway? Is this some new fashion, crime trios? Hang these up, dude. Jesus, shit. [POLICE SIREN] What's your title? Dana Archer. Yours? Bronson. Pleasure to deal with you. DANA: Likewise. [DOG BARKING] How about some milk, Mr. Archer? Just what I need. Just what America needs. Mr. Archer? I think we've found some promising new prospects for the spokesman of the Jericho Family Film Hour. Are you kiddin' me, huh? No. Do you know what this picture says to me? It says, "Leftist, pinko, commie, fat, no-neck, Jew," to me. No, where is this guy living, eh, West Hollywood? No, no, no. This is the Jericho Family Film Hour. When people turn on the set, I want it to say, "Pa-tew! American!" I don't want any ethno atrocities on my show. Daddy? Hi, sweetheart. Come on in. How are you feeling today? Better now. DANA: Don't the two of you guys ever go home? Someone has to take care of your father. [SIGHS] I've been doing that just fine for the past five years, thank you. ARCHER: Yeah. I take care of you all. You all take care of me. That's the American way. We take care of our own. Get out of here. So how was your day? How was the shopping? Great. I got the most amazing discount on the cutest bathing suit. You're gonna love it. I bet I will. And I met the coolest guy today. Oh? Mm-hm. His name is Bronson. He's blond. He's gorgeous. And I don't know, he's different. Different? What do you mean? You know I don't like different. Daddy. What, honey? This family has certain standards to keep up. Well, you can judge for yourself. He's picking me up at 7. THATCHER: You're gonna leave your partner hanging on a Saturday night for this chick? She better be fine. She better be hot. Hot? This chick is a walking fire hazard. Yeah? What are you gonna do with this girl? Just what are you gonna do with this girl? I don't know. After today, maybe we'll knock off a tanning salon, eh? Hey, word. The Bronson she knows is an act. I mean, you're gonna tell her what you're up to, huh? I don't know, Thatch. I got a unique opportunity here. So you're just gonna lie to her, right? This is no lie. This is rehearsal, yeah. Right, Bobby? Oh, that's good, that's good, Blondie. Keep talking to your posters. Ooh, da-da-da-dah. Look, Thatch, this is Saturday, right? Right. Okay, on Monday, I got to go face the wolves with this new blond gig. I don't know if it's gonna work. This is a perfect opportunity to work out some of the rough edges on being one of these California pretty boys before the real work begins. Hey, yo, man. You figured out what you're gonna tell Judith? Ah! I don't know if I'm gonna tell Judith. She's not too hot on me anymore. You know, I don't know about this thing, man. I don't know about this whole thing. I mean, you can lie to Judith if you want to, hey, yo, that's your thing. But I don't think you ought to lie to Dana. Acting is one thing, but we're talking about another person here. Thatch, don't you worry. Don't you worry a bit. For what is acting but making another person think you're somebody else? No problem, dude. Are you really gonna wear them ugly-ass shoes, man? MARTY: 1320, hey, 1320, listen, Mr. Hollywood. I'm tired of your shit. You may be an independent but you ain't that independent. Now get your ass back to the garage and turn your cab down. Dispatch out. Excuse me. No one ordered a cab here. Did you order a cab? No, I definitely did not order a cab. You must be Bronson. Peter Archer. Hi, Mr. Archer. I'm here to pick up Dana. I know. Come into my office. Thanks. Real impressive spread, Mr. Archer. Thank you. We love it. Have a seat. Just what business are you in, Mr. A.? As a matter of fact, I'm one of the largest producers of family entertainment broadcasting in the nation. No kidding. That's something. You interested in the broadcasting business, Bronson? Well, sir, acting is my gig. You done anything? No, sir. I'd sure like to, though. You mind if I ask you a few personal questions? Cool with me. Are you now or have you ever been a member of the Communist party? No, sir. ARCHER: How did you vote in the last election? BRONSON: Ron's the man for me, sir. He's doing a heck of a job. My dear, you look beautiful. Daddy, must you interrogate every man I go out with? He seems like a very nice young man. Good. Then let's go. Bye, everybody. Bye, bye. [♪♪♪] BRONSON: Well, I must admit you do look awesome. DANA: Thank you. I'm sorry, Bronson. BRONSON: Aw, you mean what happened in there? No problem. Family's my middle name. But what's the deal around here? DANA: With my father? BRONSON: Yeah, he's some kind of major movie dealer, isn't he? DANA: I don't know if you could call it that. His company, Jericho, makes what they call "Inspirational films" for churches and those Christian TV stations. BRONSON: Well, looks like the Gospel, according to your old man, is selling big time. What's with the two goons? DANA: My father keeps Kevin and James around to make him feel safe. BRONSON: Safe? Right. DANA: Are we going to take your cab? BRONSON: We can always take your wheels. DANA: No, I like yours. I think it's kind of funky. BRONSON: Okay. Away we go. Instant cab. DANA: Thank you. BRONSON: Oh, sold out. What a drag. DANA: What are we gonna do? Got room for two more? 16 million people in America are illiterates. Are you one of 'em? I got an idea. What can I do for you, cream puff? Just want to see the flick, dude. You make me come down all the way from the projection booth just to tell me that? Watch the wave, surf rat, sold out. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] I told you, sold out, no one's allowed in the booth. Hey, are you from the Big Apple, man? Yeah, you want to make something out of it? Make something out of this. Come on in. Best seats in the house. Thanks a lot. [♪♪♪] [LAUGHING] That was a pretty awesome film, eh? DANA: Beyond awesome. You have to take me surfing. BRONSON: Ah, well, gee, how about right now? DANA: Now? BRONSON: Sure, why not? I don't know if I can do this. Sure you can. Probably better than me. Okay, let's go before we chicken out. On you go. Okay. We check for the right wave. Here it comes. Okay, we start paddling. Here we go. Oh! Hold on tight now. Hold on. Here we go out the tube. Oh, ho-ho-ho. Look out, here comes the tube. Whoa-ho-ho. DANA: Oh my gosh, oh no, no, no. BRONSON: You're doing great, Dana. Hold on. Hold. Whoa. Awesome wave. Ha, ha. We're doin' it, we're doing it. Look out, we gotta come back. Hold on, hold on. Oh, ho, ho. [LAUGHING] What do you think of surfing? [♪♪♪] See you soon. Real soon. Dana? Daddy? What are you doing up? It's awfully late, isn't it? Daddy, don't start. Well, I'm sorry if I'm concerned about you running around in the middle of the night. I thought we agreed you weren't going to do this. Honey, I'm your father. I can't stop worrying about you. Daddy, look. I'm here. I'm safe. I'm home. Don't make me feel like I don't belong here. Honey, you always belong here. Then please don't start pushing me away. [WHISPERING] What took you so long? My father was up. Your father was up? I gotta go. No, no. He never comes in once my door is closed. Honest. You do this often? I might be tempted to start. Oh, Mary, I don't want to lose Dana too. [♪♪♪] MAN: Okay, okay, over here, man, over here. Your ball, man, hey. Hey, ah. [LAUGHING] All right. Ready to get your butt whopped, pretty boy? By who? Look at all that's happened the last two days. A couple of days ago, I couldn't get an agent. Now I'm chatting it up with some big broadcasting guy. I get in with Archer, man, the sky's the limit. Come a long way from your De Niro dream. Ah, no, I haven't. That'll always be there. Now I'll try something different now. Check. Ow, you fouled me, man. Oh, my gosh, you all right? Oh, my gosh.Ah! Ha, ha! Bronson. Mr. Archer wants to see you. Oh, fine. Let's go. How are you fellas today?Great, thank you. Great, great. [SLIDING DOOR OPENING] Oh, Bronson, come in, my boy. [DOOR CLOSING] Shouldn't I tell Dana I'm here? Oh, plenty of time for that. First, we have something to discuss. I was very impressed with you yesterday. I have a question to ask you. How serious are you about wanting to be an actor? Well, serious, sir. Real serious. I want you to read for the new spokesman for the Jericho Family Film Hour. Oh, are you kidding me? No. When? Now. Now? Now. Are you ready? Yes, sir. Then go ahead.

This man is the greatest program director Jericho ever had. So what do you think, Luke? Should Bronson be the next spokesman for the Jericho Network? I like his look. Speaks right to the people we're trying to reach with the shows. I can see honesty and integrity written all over his face. You put me on the airwaves, Mr. A., we'll knock 'em dead. Well, that's the kind of talk I like to hear. I think you'll do great, Bronson. I can depend on you. [GIRL LAUGHING] Hey, you, what do you think you're doing here? Kevin, James? Do you mean us? This is a private beach. You can't come in here. There are laws. I own this beach halfway to the mean tide line. You crossed that line, you're on my property. Hey, the beach is the beach. What's going on?That's what you think, Sambo. Who do you think you are? Keep your hands off her. What are you gonna do?Take him on. Wait. Go on, leave. Time to leave, just leave. You people are a bunch of assholes. You're the ones that came onto my beach. And once on my beach you want to use my telephone, my water, my toilet, my God, my toilet. Turn on the water, Bronson. What is your problem? We don't want to use--We want to use his toilet. Come on, give me a break? Why can't you stay with your own kind where you belong? Bronson, the water. You people are animals, you know that? Animals! Animals! Damn you! Damn you! Niggers. Niggers on my beach. Take a deep breath.Niggers on my beach. Calm down, they're gone. They're gone.

If there is any of you out there amongst the chosen who have not received His message, please come to your television sets now so that all of God's race may be aware of our special place in this world. Remember, we the chosen must band together to squash the dark heathens so that we may enjoy a pure and clean existence. Tonight, we bring you the story of Henry Krinkle. Henry is a lost soul, a man without direction in his life. He wanders the streets of America, hoping to find the meaning in his life that you and I already know. Let us follow Henry on the road to the ultimate truth. The pure truth, the white truth. Tonight, on the Jericho Family Film Hour, we are proud to present to you the Christian broadcast premier of God's Taxi. DIRECTOR: And cue tape. That's a cut. Especially liked the way you said God's Taxi. Wasn't he great, Daddy? Yes, he certainly was. And, Bronson, with this contract, great things are gonna happen for you, I can feel it. Thanks, Mr. A. It's really one sweet deal you laid on me. Well, there'll be many more to come, don't worry about that. Any time you need us, Bronson. You're always welcome here. Oh, my God, I gotta go. I got to be at class in 20 minutes. Honey, don't you want to come with us this time? No, Daddy, I gotta go. I'm really proud of you. Bye, everybody.Bye. Bye. Well, Bronson, want to come with us? Sure. What are we up to? I believe every man should have a place to fire his guns. Huh? Huh? Huh? Absolutely. MR. ARCHER: When I was a boy, my father went to great pains to teach me the value of guns. He was a great patriot. He loved this country. I founded Jericho on the principles that he taught me as a child. God-- Country-- Family. I make wholesome films for wholesome people. Never underestimate the power of traditional Americans. God-fearing, TV-watching Americans. [GUNFIRE] Way to bag 'em, Mr. A. You love this country, Bronson? Oh, in a big way, Mr. A. You know that this country that we love so much is being invaded? Did you know by whom? [GUN FIRING] The Ruskies? No, much worse than that. We're being invaded from within. And if we're not careful, this country's going to be overrun by filth. [GUN FIRING] Men like you and me belong together. Are you with me, Bronson? [GUN FIRING] MR. ARCHER: You with me? Yes, sir. There are certain situations in this country that must be taken care of. There comes a time when enough is enough and you got to stand up for your rights. The United States is the greatest country in the world and it is our duty to make sure that we keep it that way. [GUN FIRING] We must protect ourselves. [GUN FIRING] DANA: Bronson? What's this? Oh, that's just a gripless stunt I pulled with my buddy, Thatcher. Wanted to see what it'd be like to be a nerd. You don't look like a nerd at all. In fact, I think you look kind of cute. Oh, yeah? Mm-hm. What do you want a picture for? You have the real thing right here. Bronson. What can I say? My mind's not responsible. MR. ARCHER: Ladies and gentlemen, we'll take questions now. Questions, please. PRESS REPORTER: Mr. Green. Mr. Green, can you tell the press how you became the new spokesman for Jericho? I-- Well, we had defined a man who unmistakably embodied the traditional American virtues, honesty, integrity, morality. We searched long for such a man. We prayed and God sent us Bronson Green. REPORTER: Mr. Green, do you plan a long association with Jericho? Definitely so. I would also like to take this chance to thank Peter Archer and everyone involved with the Jericho Network for this wonderful opportunity. I feel it is an honor to be able to spread the Jericho message to the God-fearing wholesome TV-watching Americans that are the backbone of this country. Can you tell us who your greatest inspiration in the entertainment industry has been? My greatest inspiration? My greatest inspiration is and will always be Peter Archer. [LAUGHING] REPORTER: Mr. Archer, a word from you, sir? Sir, Mr. Archer. [ORGAN MUSIC PLAYING] Tonight on the Jericho Family Film Hour, we are proud to present to you the Christian broadcast premiere ofGod's Taxi. [ORGAN MUSIC STOPS] Ta-da. God's Taxi? You must be joking. That's no joke. It's a real piece of work. It's a piece of something. Piece of shit. It's not a piece of work, man. [EXHALES] What is this pure truth, white truth? Where do you get off spitting out this racist bull? Come on, Thatch. I'm no racist, you know that. This is just acting. It ain't acting, man, it's junk. It's disgusting. You've crossed the line, man. You have crossed the line. You're not just lying to some chick and her old man, anymore. You've sold your morals out. What is this shit? Look at this, huh? Holding a glass of milk and smiling? Talk about selling out. All the time I've known you, I've never ever seen you drink a glass of milk. And now you're selling a product you don't even use. Yeah, that's right. But you know there's a big difference in selling a product and selling yourself out. We've known each other 10 years, right, 10 years? Yeah. In all that time, man, it's always been your dream to do a De Niro role, right?Right. Look at you now, man, spitting out that racist bull 'cause it's the only job you can get. Thanks a lot, Thatch. Oh, yeah, man, thanks a lot. Yeah, but see, I know you, man, and I know you're not a racist, you know? But you got millions of people here who are gonna believe that you're this big bad-ass bigot, looking forward to getting rid of all the niggers. Goddamn it, Thatcher. How come when I get the first taste of success in my entire career, you've got to come down on me like I'm some carnival sideshow? 'Cause you are, man. You want millions of people to think that you're a racist, huh? Is that what you want? You call that success? I'm sorry, man. I'm just doing what Archer wants. He pays me. I give 'im what he wants. Yeah, right. You doin' what Archer wants. What he wants. Seems to me you've forgotten what you wanted, man. You left New York, and you came out here to California with $100 dreams, babe. Hundred-dollar dreams. Now you're settling for these stinking two-bit fantasies. You think De Niro would ever even breathe in the direction of Peter Archer? I don't need this shit from you. Oh, yeah, right, man. And who the hell else is gonna give it to you? Judith, huh? I bet you haven't even called her, man. Fuck Judith. Oh, yeah, right. What are you saying? Judith loves you, Bronson. She loves herself. And you don't? Hey, I don't need Judith. You know, and for that matter, I don't need you either. THATCHER: You're blowing it, man. You came out here and you're throwing away everything you worked for. You're just throwing it all away. I'm not throwing everything away. I'm cleaning house. And I'm getting rid of everything that I don't need anymore. [SIGHING] MR. ARCHER: Pull over. Pull over, right now. Damn it, James, stop the car right now. BRONSON: What's wrong, Mr. A.? What the hell do these people think they're doing? What the hell's happening to the America that I love? Damn them. You see it, Bronson, do you see it? It's huge, Mr. A. MR. ARCHER: Huge. You're damn right it's huge. God! You okay, Mr. Archer? It's all right, Mr. Archer. Just go ahead and have a seat, sir. Take a deep breath. You'll take care of him, huh?Yes, sir, we will. Let's go, Bronson. The last bastion of goodness in America. What's wrong, Mr. A.? What is wrong is something even Ronald Reagan can't cure. See, Bronson, once men like you and me had a place in this world, uncontested. We were respected by everyone. I don't need to tell you who the very first true Americans were. The Indians? No. No, they were savages. No, I'm talking about real men, white men, civilized men. The proof of how savage the Indians were, lies in how poorly they've adapted to the civilized life. No, God gave this country to the white man. It was his gift to us. He meant for the beauty of America to be enjoyed by men like you and me. Unfortunately, our forefathers made a grave mistake. They brought in slaves from Africa. When they saw how fertile this great land was, they brought in more slaves to help them tend the fields. Slavery was the single greatest evil this country's ever known. You know why? Because our forefathers neglected to send them back. Inadvertently, they unleashed upon this beautiful, beautiful, beautiful land an infestation of the lowest form of human life, an infestation that we have been powerless to rid ourselves of until now because now, here, right now, I'm standing up. Here is a man who will stand up to the scum and the dogs and the filth. I am standing up. What we do now is teach the Negro that he is not wanted here. Ultimately, I intend to use the power of the Jericho Network to rid ourselves of these foul creatures, but first, just a signal, a sign, an unmistakable sign... that the time has come, the seeds of revolution are in the ground. Do you know that in every one of these 50 united states, there are groups of people just waiting? Groups of right-thinking Aryan people, cleaning their guns, and waiting for a sign from me. Shall we oblige them, Bronson? Are you with us? Bronson, are you with us? Are you, Bronson? Are you with us? Are you with us? Are you, Bronson? Yes, sir. You can count on me, Mr. A. Oh, man. [EXHALES] Bronson? What's the matter with you? You look a little pale. Oh, I'm just going through a little identity crisis here. What are you talking about? Oh, it's nothing. Let's get out of here. Use all our contacts, all our power, bring me that nigger. [MOVIE PLAYING IN THEATER] DE NIRO'S VOICE: Listen, you fuckers, you screwheads. Here is a man who would not listen, you fuckers, you screwheads. Here is a man who would not take it anymore. A man who stood up against the scum, the dogs, the filth, the shit. Here is a man who stood up. Dana, I got to talk to you. Not now, Bronson, I'm watching the movie. Now, Dana, now. What in the hell have you done to your hair? Christ, Judith. What are you doing here? I want to talk to you. I knew I'd find you here. You haven't missed a screening of Taxi Driver since I've known you. What's going on here? I was just trying to tell you, Dana. What's with you, Bronson? Judith, you got to go. Look, would you calm down, please? That's De Niro up on the screen. Hey, you talkin' to me, asshole? This is my goddamn movie, you understand? I'll do what I damn well please. If you don't settle down, we have to ask you to leave. Shut up. It's got nothing to do with you. What has gotten into you, Bronson? What are you gonna do, punk, huh? Okay. Okay, fine, fine. We'll talk outside. We don't need your Taxi Driverfans. Or freaks. DANA: What's going on here? That's what I'd like to know. Who are you? I'm his girlfriend. Or at least, I was before he bleached his hair. Before he bleached his hair? Dana, I've got to talk to you. I've been meaning to tell you. I dyed my hair blond to see if I could make it as a pretty boy. I'm a New York actor with dark hair. I wasn't cutting it so I made the change to see if I could get a job. Hell, I'm no beach boy. I can hardly swim. You're a pig. No, you're a low-life, that's what you are. Low-life. Now I don't know what you've done but I don't want to know. I don't ever want to know. DANA: Bronson, did you do all this just to get in with my father? Dana, I had no idea who your father was when I met you. God, you're-- you are such a liar. I can't believe I trusted you. I can't-- I-- I can't believe you did this to me. Just-- [FOOTSTEPS LEAVING] BRONSON: Bobby, I screwed up. Oh, what did I do? [BLUES MUSIC] KEVIN: Well, well, well. Look at what we got here, James. Hey, looks like a little black poster boy. What do you guys want, man? Do you know what negative reinforcement is? [♪♪♪] You got 'im? Daddy! [♪♪♪] [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Thatcher! Thatcher, it's me. Jesus Christ! Oh, my God. Pure truth. Pure truth. [♪♪♪] ARCHER: Stupid dumb niggers. Will you ever learn? Archer! Archer! He's not here. So why don't you just go away? Dana, your father's flipped out. He kidnapped my best friend. More stories, Bronson? That's just great. More stories. This is no story, Dana. This is real. You're one to tell me what's real and what's not real. You're a liar, you're a bastard, and you're a cheap actor who gets off playing with people. I know, Dana. What I did to you was wrong. God knows I'm sorry. But I got no time for apologies right now. There's something going down now with your father I got to put a stop to. What are you talking about? I just went by my buddy Thatcher's apartment. He's gone. His place is destroyed. Dana, your father's behind this. Believe me, I know he's behind this. Now I don't know what he's done to Thatch, but I got a good idea where he's taking him. And I'm gonna do something about it. Bronson! How can I believe one word you're saying to me? You can't, but you know your father, and if you want to help him, you'll come with me now. And if you don't, you have no say in what happens to him. [♪♪♪] JAMES: You okay, Mr. Archer? Okay, take him away. ARCHER: Damn. I got him, Mr. Archer. Go ahead. [♪♪♪] You have no place in my world. [TIRES SCREECHING] Bronson? Dana! Mr. A., you've helped me find the real me, the pure me. What are you doing here? Kevin. I've come to help. Trying to. Come here, bitch. What? Come on, move. Up. What? Move! ARCHER: No! no! He's got Dana. Bronson, this doesn't make sense. BRONSON: Keep moving, Dana. Keep moving. Just keep moving. What do you want, Bronson? BRONSON: Just move away from Thatcher. Move away, now. I got your daughter here, Archer. Bronson, why are you doing this? BRONSON: Move! What are you doing with my daughter? What are you doing with Thatcher? Lie down. Huh? You know Thatcher? What is this? What do you want? DE NIRO'S VOICE: You talkin' to me? I'm standin' here. Are you ready to make a move? It's your move. Here is a man who would not take it anymore. A man who stood up against the scum and the dogs and the filth, the pigs, the bigots like you. A man who stood up. Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, I saw you coming, you shit-heel. I'm standing here. You make the move. It's your move. Damn it, James, drop it! You'll never get away with this, Bronson. I'm gonna crush you. Hey, you talkin' to me? You talkin' to me? Who the fuck do you think you're talkin' to? Lie down, you slimy-assed bigot bastard. Lie down. You too. Here's your pure truth, Archer. Here's your pure truth, your white truth. They're gonna put you away for 20 years for this. I don't understand. What-- Sorry, honey. I didn't have time to rehearse. It's the only thing I know how to do. Dana, help me. Help me. I'm sorry, Daddy. I can't. BRONSON: It's all right, buddy. It'll be okay. You'll be okay. THATCHER: Oh, man. You'll be okay. It's all over. [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪]
