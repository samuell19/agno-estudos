(eerie music) (hammer tapping) (chains jingling) - Secured upstairs. - It's gonna be okay, Jack. You're safe. - Dad, I wanna help you. - You're too important to us. - [Jack] Oh, I hate the smell of this stuff. - Yeah, so do they. (dramatic music) (crickets chirping) Hold onto this, son. Never let it outta your sight. Jack, you promise me, no matter what you hear, no matter what happens, don't come out from your hiding place. Do you understand? - Yeah. (banging on door) - [Sid] Mary! Let me in. It's me, Sid. Open the door! - Sid, you know I can't open the door! (banging on door) - [Sid] You can't just leave me out here to die, Mary. Please, Mary! - Sid, it's too late, the sun has already set. - [Sid] Open the door, Mary. Christ's sakes. Mary, it's not like I'm some stranger, just open the door! - Are you alone? There's nobody else out there? - [Sid] Yes, Tom, I'm alone. Just open the door, Tom. - No. - We can't just leave him out there to die. He's our friend. - Thank god. Let me in, thank god. Thank god. I thought you guys were never gonna let me in. - Sid, what are you doing here? - I had to come, I had to warn you. (booming) (suspenseful music) (gasping) Drop the gun, Mary! Sorry, Tom. They made me an offer, man. Eternal life! You know how their blood has to power to heal, man. Well, if you drink an ounce every year you live forever, man. Without even becoming a vampire. - You're one of us. A hunter! - Not anymore I'm not, man. Always knew that joke was gonna be your downfall, man. (chains jingling) (growling) (door clanking closed) (door creaking) (growling) (dramatic music) (feet thudding) (grunting) (thudding) (groaning) (neck cracking) (thudding) (grunting) (heels clicking) - [Jack] Mom, wake up. - What good fortune. The list of secret families. You've done well, Mr. Romero. How many generations of your family did it take to compile this? Now it's over. (fire crackling) (yelling) (thudding) - Mom, wake up. Wake up. Mom. Mom. Mom. - I'm sorry you had to see that. Now it's up to you. I love you, son. - I love you, too. (cracking) - Get out of here, Jack. - But I don't wanna leave you. - Run! Never trust anyone! (groaning) (muffled yelling) - All dead? The entire family? - The child is missing. - The boy. (thunder cracking) (light dramatic music) - I'd like to make a toast. To our little family and our impending reunion. - Argento, 1857? - Was a good year, wasn't it? - A bloody good year. (dramatic music) - Joaquin is this chicken or is this fish, man? - Excuse me, would you like another bottle of wine, Mr. Argento? - Yes, definitely. (muffled talking) - Would you like to have your picture taken? - Not right now, thank you. - Okay. (clicks tongue) - Thank you. As I was saying. (sniffing) He's here. (dramatic music) - Quintin! - What is it? (gun banging) (grunting) (screaming) (groaning) (grunting) (woman screaming) (grunting) (heavy breathing) (camera clicks) (moans) (grunting) (thudding) (hissing) (neck cracking) (groaning) (smacking) (thudding) (neck cracking) (grunting) (neck cracking) (growling) (yelling) (neck cracking) (body thudding) (sirens wailing) - [Ward] Did you see the shotgun blast in the shirt? - Yeah. - Take a look. - That is an old wound, Hoop. From the scarring I'd say a month old. - Yeah, boy has seen some action. - Yep. - But according to his id he's an investment banker. - Well whatever he is, or whatever he was, this wound did not come from tonight. - So what's the cause of death? - A broken neck. But it looks like he got hit somewhere with all this blood. - Send a sample for DNA testing, maybe the blood came from the perp. - Yeah, maybe. (light suspenseful music) - Yo, Hoop. I got something for ya. - What is it? - You're gonna love me for this. - Well, as long as I don't have to kiss you. - Photographer here got a picture of the guy. - Get me an APP out on this guy, armed and extremely dangerous, four counts of murder one. (phone ringing) - Yeah? - [Kendall] Raimy, this is Kendall. Wake up. - Kendall. What, did I miss a deadline? - [Kendall] Come on, come on, you have to get to Los Angeles right away. - Why do I have to go to Los Angeles? - [Kendall] Some maniac just shot up a restaurant. Come on! - So? This is the World Inquisitor, we don't cover real stories, remember? - [Kendall] Hey, we are a real newspaper, we cover real stories. (dramatic music) - [Woman] Plate and script for 148 19th Avenue, prowling in that scene. State you are clear. Unit 14 clear. You too, eastern and western. - [Woman] What's up? - [Woman] Medic four-- (creaking) (thudding) (moaning) (light suspenseful music) - Do you see that? - Guy. (dramatic music) - Come on. - Let's drive. (tires screeching) (heavy breathing) (sirens wailing) (gate clanking) Freeze! - [Man] Positive id on suspect wanted in restaurant killings traveling on foot northbound on Palmetto towards Hill Street. - Shit! (tires screeching) (grunting) - I said freeze! Suspect is heading east on 24th. East on 24th, I am still in foot pursuit. - [Man] Suspect now heading south on Overland. - South on Overland, good, I can head them off. (tires screeching) (muffled police radio talking) (grunting) - Damn! - [Man] We picked up the suspect on South Street. (muffled police radio talking) (sirens wailing) (grunting) (thudding) (heavy breathing) - Jesus. - Drive! Go! Go! - Okay, okay. I'm not from around here so I have no idea where I am. Where do you want me to go? - Go, go! - Okay, okay. (gun banging) (glass shattering) (grunting) (banging) (tires screeching) (smashing) - Shit, they're gone. - Dispatch, this is unit 14, suspect has escaped on foot with a female hostage. (light dramatic music) (sizzling) (sighs) (suspenseful music) - Welcome, My Lord. - Mister O'Mack. - There was a problem, sir. - Speak. - At the banquet. The American families were killed. - All of them? - Yes sir. It was the hunter. - Boy. He must be here. Do the others know? - No, sir. But the police do. - My love. Always. Gisele - Sir? - That will be all. - I'm afraid I have some rather unfortunate news. The four remaining members of the American families were killed yesterday. - No. Not Carmella. - It was the boy. I'm very sorry, Jacqueline. - He's dead! I'll kill him with my bare hands. - This is no time and place. - The time for Jack Cutter is over! He'll be dead by morning. - Sit down, I order you. - He killed Carmella and we are just going to sit here? Do nothing? I demand vengeance! As our king you owe us protection. Retaliation! - Sit down! - I will not await vengeance. The hunter will die! - Let her go. We must find our strength. We must feed so that we may breed. (laughing) - Oh. Hello? Hello? I'm Raimy Baker. I'm a reporter with the World Inquisitor. Who are you? Hello? (sighs) Why did you shoot all those people in that restaurant? Did you kill those people? - Yes. - Why? - You wouldn't understand. - Why don't you try me, maybe I would. - Their people and my people have been hunting each other for centuries. - Okay, you're right, I don't understand. - You're a reporter. Right? - Yes. - You want the story. They were vampires. - They were vampires? What do you mean, like Bela Lugosi vampires? - You think I'm crazy, right? - I don't know if you're crazy, it just doesn't make much sense. (dramatic music) - It's all right there. (muffled people talking) - [Man] Straight in my foot. - Mom, who are these guys? - Many of the legends about vampires are untrue. They are nocturnal, they prefer to hunt at night because their eyes are sensitive to sunlight. You can wound and hurt them, but their blood heals them in seconds. - So what are all these names in here? Are they vampires? Why are they all crossed out? - Every time I killed one, I crossed out a name. Every time my father, my grandfather, my great grandfather killed one. - Are there any left? - Those were the last four. I got them just in time. - What, before they had dessert? - This isn't a joke. They were here to breed. - To breed? - There's a total eclipse centered here soon. When that happens, everyone they bite becomes a vampire. It's like a disease. - So you came here to kill them? With what, silver bullets or wooden stakes or something? - That's just a myth. You have to break their backs. - Is that what you did to the people in the restaurant? My god. - I'm a hunter. That's what I was born to do. The family business. We'll stay here until dark. You need to get some rest. - Mr. O'Mack. The police have our four brothers. You know what to do. - Why won't you look at me? (light music) What's wrong? (booming) (footsteps thudding) (dramatic music) What's going on? What was that sound? Talk to me. What's going on? (heavy breathing) (booming) (thudding) (screaming) (gun banging) (groaning) (grunting) (Jacqueline laughing) (smacking) (thudding) (groaning) (Jacqueline screeching) (groaning) - Your days are over. You killed my woman. So now I kill your woman. (grunting) (thudding) (Jacqueline laughing) Beautiful little creature you are, huh? Such spirit. Now come on, don't fight me. You are going to love this, huh? (gun clicking) Put the gun down. I'll kill her. - She doesn't even know my name. (banging) (screaming) (booming) - I thought you said that they were all dead. - That's what I thought. She'll have to feed to get her strength back. - How are you gonna find her? - You have to leave, it's not safe here. - How are you gonna find her? There's a million people out there. - The same way I always do. - Hey, wait. What's your name? - Cutter. (humming) - So. Reporter, huh? (dramatic music) (upbeat music) (muffled talking and cheering) ♪ Transformed by desire ♪ You're breaking this heart of stone ♪ - Where are those bodies? - They're in the cooler back there. Four doors on the right. But I wouldn't, hey, I wouldn't look at 'em if I were you, it's not a pretty sight, believe me. - No problem. - Man, this is too weird. I gotta call this in. You'll excuse me? - No problem. ♪ I'm falling into ♪ Oblivion with you ♪ You touch me ♪ Like a blind man reads braille ♪ ♪ You follow the scent of my trail ♪ ♪ You find me in my secret hiding place ♪ ♪ I'm falling into ♪ Oblivion with you ♪ I'm falling into ♪ Oblivion with you (phone beeping) (suspenseful music) - [Ward] Fucking cocks-- (groaning) (light buzzing) (slamming) (door creaking) (grunting) (groaning) - You wanna know what it feels like to have your neck snapped? Mister hunter! (gun banging) (grunting) (thudding) (groaning) (thudding) (gun banging) (singing in foreign language) (muffled talking) (grunting) (smacking) (clanking) (thudding) (groaning) (smacking) (cracking) - How many are left? - Five, maybe 800. (laughing) (thudding) (grunting) - How many? - Doesn't matter 'cause you're at the end of your blood line. (laughing) (groaning) (heavy breathing) (blasting) - Mr. Ward? Mr. Ward, hello? Hello? (gasping) - Gisele. - Who are you? - [Bruno] Gisele. (speaking in foreign language) - What? (speaking in foreign language) Gisele. Oh, Gisele. - You're my, what are you doing here? (heavy breathing) - Oh shit. Fuck no. Fuck! You fucking hunter! (dramatic music) - [Raimy] Thanks. - [Browning] What were you doing there? - [Raimy] I was looking for the medical examiner. - Okay. And did you find him? Because we seemed to have lost him and he also disappeared with four of his stiffs. Maybe you could fill in the blanks for us. - Exactly how'd you get away from that psycho? - He just let me go. - Where did he hold you hostage? - In an abandoned building somewhere downtown. - I'm nailing this guy to the cross, the status on him is shoot on sight. - Well, you don't have to do that. - Listen, he killed four people, and he kidnapped you by gunpoint. - I know what he did, but he said that those people were trying to kill him. - Right. Table six conspiracy. Listen, lady, he woulda told you anything. (light suspenseful music) - So, tell me, baby, are you a religious woman? - Why? - Well, 'cause if ya are, your prayers have just been answered. - They have? - Yeah. I can't wait to get back to my place. - Neither can I. (chuckling) (suspenseful music) (engine skipping) - This never happens. - Doesn't matter. I want you here. Right now. - It's a stick shift. - So? - Well, then, get ready for the screw of the century. (laughing) (clanking) (soft moaning) (man chuckles) (man screaming) (gun banging) (groaning) - [Sid] Jesus. (booming) - Look, I told you for the 15th time, I saw them myself. - Vampires? Honest to god? - Yes. (scoffs) - I dun heard it all. - Miss Baker, if you'll forgive me, I'm not superstitious at all. - You guys did the autopsies. Didn't you find anything strange? - Four of the victims had a blood disorder. - There you have it. Blood, vampires. (sighs) - You're telling me this guy Cutter believes he's killing vampires? - Your autopsies say that he is killing vampires. (sighs) Look, he's completely outnumbered. He thinks he can do it himself, but he needs help. - Okay. Take me to him. (suspenseful music) (sinister laughing) (thudding) (smacking) (thudding) (groaning) (screaming) (thudding) (groaning) (thudding) (grunting) (smacking) (gun banging) (whistling) (Bruno laughing) (groaning) (rattling) - [Raimy] Are you okay? - I thought I told you to go. - Yeah, well, I didn't listen. Oh man. What happened? - There are four more. Plus a human servant. - Cutter, you are gonna need help. Come on, you had. You know, you can't go around your whole life thinking that everybody you meet is just gonna turn on you. You've gotta trust somebody. Come on. - Okay. - Okay. - That's what I'm here for. Oh, I'm a cop, ho. - Whoa, Cutter. It's Detective Browning, he's seen all the evidence, he believes everything. - Put the gun down. I'm here to listen. How many of these vampire things are left? - There's four. - Okay, and they're after him, right? So, do you know where these guys are? Well, it sounds like you could use some help. Let's go get 'em. - Come on. - Tell me something, Cutter, how many of these vampires have you killed personally? - 13. - 13, huh? Out of curiosity, how do you tell someone's a vampire anyway, I mean? - I can sense them. - That's interesting. - Hey! You said you-- - Shut up, don't move. All right? You fuckin' nuts, both of ya. Mental cases, vampires. It's bullshit right up there with fucking Rumpelstiltskin and Tom fucking Thumb. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. (smacking) (grunting) Shit. - Hey, wait! (gun banging) Fine, arrest me. I assaulted an officer, arrest me. (engine rumbling) - Get a life, will ya? (tires screeching) - Shit. - What a fucking toilet this place has become. It's on its way to hell. I love it when they're drunk. (dramatic music) (girl moaning) Did you hear me, precious? I said I love it when you're drunk. (muffled yelling) - [Man] I'll get the beer if you get some ice. I've had enough of you and this place! - [Woman] No! (woman moaning softly) - Now drink. (woman yelling) (suspenseful music) (banging) (heavy breathing) (smacking) (thudding) (groaning) Fuck! Come on! (laughing) Come on. Over here! (gun banging) (shell clanking) (dramatic music) (growling) (thudding) (groaning) (grunting) Let's see if the boy can fly. Can you fly, boy? (choking) (groaning) You'll never kill all of us. Breeding time is upon us. Soon you'll be too late. (laughing) (grunting) (gun banging) (slamming) (body thudding) - So, Detective Browning. - Hey Frank, what's up? - We've just had a report of a massacre under the Third Street Bridge. - What? How many dead? - It's unconfirmed at this time, Sir. - Call Detective Hooper and get him down there and start writing the paper on it right away. - Yes, sir. - Tell him I'll be down there in 30 minutes. (bird cawing) (dramatic music) (gasping) - Oh shit. (panting) (gate creaking) (button clicking) (grunting) Shit. - Hey, gorgeous. Let's play awhile, huh? - Fuck you. (smacking) (laughing) (thudding) (dramatic music) (heavy breathing) - Do you know who I am? - Yeah, you're a leech. - I'm the king of the vampires. The emperor of the dark. - Okay, so you're a big leech. - After the total eclipse you shall be my first. Then, you'll be my queen. - I'll die first. - You can have both. Be gentle. Adieu. Gisele. (engine rumbling) (helicopter whirring) - Hoop, what do ya got? - Got 11 dead and no survivors. - What's the cause of death? - Somebody drained her blood. I dunno how, ya know. They used some sort of suction device, maybe some metal tools or somethin'. If I didn't know no better I'd say a vampire did it, but... - Need all available units go to Third and Jesse. Work hard who are staying. - What, hey, Ronnie. Ronnie! (engine rumbling) (heavy breathing) (gate clanking) (gasping) - Where is she? - Why do you care about the humans, Cutter? They're not like you. Your family and my family are more alike. You and I are one and the same. Both of us are night hunters. Killers. - I don't kill innocent people. (sirens wailing) (laughing) (tires screeching) - No, no, no, don't. I believe. I saw it. - You're not gonna arrest me again. - No! I just came from like 11 confirmed dead. The blood was sucked out of 'em. - There isn't much time. - Well, get in, come on, hurry up. Holy shit. (suspenseful music) - We're running out of time. - I don't like this, it scares the shit outta me. Split up. (gun clicking) - Drop it and kick it across the floor. (clanking) You want me, don't you? It's okay, everybody wants me. I can see it in your eyes. You and I together. We would be more powerful than fission. Come with me. Join with me. (gun banging) (gasping) (thudding) (moaning) (screaming) (neck cracking) (suspenseful music) (guns banging) (groaning) - You motherfucker. (laughing) (grunting) Not feeling too good, huh? Hurts, I know. Been there. (gun banging) (yelling) (body thudding) (heavy breathing) Hey, boy. I spared your life 25 years ago. You owe me! You have some of that serum, give me some, come on. Thanks, man. - It's gone. (crying) Are you all right? - Two out of a possible 20. Yeah, I'd say I'm fine. It was just beginner's luck. - I'll be back for you. - Hey, don't take so long. (suspenseful music) - It's the boy. How very sad. There we are. You're not even as good as your father. How could you expect to defeat me? Hmm? (clanking) It will be over in a matter of moments. (groaning) Sorry you'll miss the wedding. - [Raimy] Cutter! Cutter! (grunting) (thudding) (groaning) - Think you know the arts. I created them. (smacking) (yelling) I've had hundreds of years to perfect my skills. (grunting) (thudding) You did well against Sangster and Ulmer, but they were children. (grunting) (smacking) (upbeat music) - Ow! - No need to panic, my dear. - Ow, you're hurting me. - To be very pleasant, the whole thing. - Let go of me. - [Bruno] My dear, come back. (grunting) (smacking) (thudding) (heavy breathing) (thudding) (dramatic music) (grunting) (neck cracking) (suspenseful music) (groaning) - [Raimy] Cutter! Cutter! (groaning) (smacking) (grunting) (smacking) (groaning) - You have a very large heart. (screaming) (groaning) (thudding) (smacking) (heavy breathing) (growling) (neck cracking) (thudding) (light music) - It's over. - You okay? - So, I guess you got your story. - Yeah, I got a story but there's one problem. Not even the World Inquisitor would believe this one. So, um, you got a first name or you just go by Cutter? - Jack. - It's nice to meet you, Jack. Let's get outta here. (light music)
