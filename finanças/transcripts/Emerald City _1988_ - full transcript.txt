Kate was against the move, but I couldn't wait. I hated her friends and they hated my movies. They were talking about middle- class snobs . And Dave was the biggest. Melbourne makes them. Fools. Disgusting snobbish fools. Chase them. You don't think I'll miss company? - We said I was leaving You agreed. - Because you never do what you say. I almost didn't stay. Sydney seemed to me like a city without a soul. Our Melbourne friends care about people and justice. Colin believed in the correctness of the decision. In the end I left. Take this. The seed. Quickly. Movement. Towns. Seed, come on. I left room for the computer. - But I just put the bag. Put her away. - I can't... - Penny, put the bag away. This is expensive. Yes, uh. Look what you've done. EMERALD ClTY (SMARAGDNl GRAD) Goodbye, Melbourne. - Shit. Penny, is there a tram in Sydney? -Of course not, fool The monorail runs. -What is that? - You don't know anything? Enough, we have a long way to go. Columns. -What's up? The seed. - Don't do that to her. How many stars does the hotel have? - We're only staying tonight. - and better Do they have a TV here? -I do not know. - will we have separate rooms? Forgiveness. - What is that? Let me see you now. Screenwriter I can not see anything. You almost hit a truck. -What? - You almost hit him. Fasten your seat belts. Take a look. Beautiful. Reiser You must be kidding. -Gofi, let's go! - The hedge is lush. Nice chimney. The right one. Everything is falling apart. Sam, pick up the box. - Why do I always have to? - It's yours. Penny, maybe the house is haunted. Shut up. What did we learn?-What a hole Bubavaba. The city is teeming with them. Port city. Phew. - All port cities are full of cockroaches. They arrive by boat. It stinks. Goof, if you see a rat, kill it. That's right. The door won't open. - Is this house worth as much as our old one? It's worth more. - Why? - Because more people want to live here. What other city offers such a view? - Rio. But he is not the most beautiful. - I came here as a child. I remember the lush leaves, the blue water, ferries and lighthouses. There is no shortage of color. - Decadence also attracted me. Didn't I drag you here? - No, I enjoy it. - It disgusts me. - Kate. A beautiful city. Look at him. -Judge the city by the view the climax is superficiality. I'm sorry , lleyn, the city is terrible. The media is looking for trivia, where, what and how to be seen. Glamour, image and style. Brainless New York. And Melbourne is Perth without the sun. Kate is convinced that Sydney is full of thieves. - It is There are also in Melbourne. Sydney is different. Money is more important here. - Why? The view of the city depends on him. In Melbourne, everyone is depressed No one in Sydney wastes time debating the meaning of life. People have been looking for a better view of the sea all their lives. - You don't like s I like it. This is my city. I accept him as he is. Just don't act like Melbourne, lest you burn out. Draft of my new project. Kolin, a wonderful surprise. - It will be our best cooperation I should have been more careful. What idiot would let go all ends of life for boyhood memories. A madman. Maybe I secretly wanted to get closer to the world of celebrities. Hello. -Hello. Are you Colin Rogers? -That I love your work. I have seen most of your films. -Thank you. And I want to write a screenplay, but I block the typewriter Where do you get ideas from? - lz the stories I hear, the world around me. Sometimes it just dawns on me. -Really? If they dawned on me too. Kate, this is Kat Mitchell. Kate Rogers. - Hello. - Hello. Ket went to the book. I hear she could be great. - About what? About the struggle for the success of black women. It will be an impressive book. If you want to write, persevere - It must be difficult. -Not easy. And you're better off if you don't write. I regret my professor days. At least I didn't have to read reviews and think about them in the morning. Don't let that stop you . - I won't. I apologize. I was glad. - Also. Goodbye. -Sorry. O, Boe... let Why is he avoiding me? Maybe she doesn't like the draft? It's great. Colin Rogers. Mike McCord. Welcome to Sydney. -Thank you. I haven't seen you before. -I don't come to parties like this anymore. You have to go for cocktails. That's Sydney's golden rule. That's where you learn the most. I watched one of your movies on the weekend. - Koji Days of Vajna and Vitlam. I don't know why the critics cut it. Most of the reviews were good. - I guess I read a bad one. But the movie is fun. - I hope it's more than that. The ending worried me. I would resolve the remaining ambiguities. It's a sign of the times. - l am working on some projects. What kind? - Contemporary international action adventure. It passes. And I should be writing such scenarios, right? - Look Look at them. Downtrodden guys sell bad movies. Real boredom. We have such a boring history that it is not worth mythologizing. What are you working on? -On a new scenario. - Modern? -Not really. Gave up on the middle class? - I wanted a change. Who produces? lain ross? -Maybe. - You asked her? - Not yet And to produce yourself? - He doesn't know - it 's worth it. And you are in control. llejn always adapted my works well. If you are satisfied, fine. I want to give you a couple of ideas Are you free on Sunday? Did you talk to lleyn last night? - No. - Did she read the script? I do not know. - How long has it been at her place? - Two weeks. Rude. She should at least tell us if she read it. Maybe five-hour lunches take up too much of her time. lli cannot consume any new material afterwards. She is. sorry. -Ao, Manone. Where did you go on Saturday? Really? Julie is going crazy. Don't talk all day. -Good. - You're leaving in 3 minutes. Dad is bothering me. - Sam, did you feed the dog? -Not yet. -Come on. We're leaving in two minutes. - Here's your shopping list. Come on, don't... - You lost two last week. Call the masters for stove and machine. They broke down. So when will I work? You're in the office, I'm dropping off the kids, I go shopping, paint, repair around the house. When will I work? - You have flexible working hours. I do not have. Not fair. Really? Hey. Feed the dog. Colin. - I was passing by so I said to stop by. -Very nice. You are occupied? -Yes I am. I won't hold you back. Did you get to take a look at the script? It's just a sketch. - Rough. - I was expecting something modern. Why? - You wrote like that until now. Because. - I wanted a break from that. They say I only write about that. - Who? -Critics, friends. Don't let critics direct you in a way you don't want to. - I wanted it. That story is important to me. - Coast Guard. - Uncle was in it. Aunt raised animals. Cinematography can do without it But she did not risk her life during the war by following planes and saving us from invasion. - That will attract a mass audience Of course. -Let's have lunch...-You think he won't...?-Let's have lunch next week These people are amazingly brave. You were not moved by the story about them? When was the last time you heard of someone risking their life for their country? They are true heroes. Why don't we make movies about him anymore Colin Rogers seems like a nice guy. - He's full of himself. - It's not. He seemed modest to me. l should be. Eight of his works have been screened, which is eight more than you. But he is on the decline. Audiences now want action and excitement. If you think he's going down, why are you with him? What a fish. I still can't believe that he sleeps with me every night. I get goosebumps when I hear her voice When she's talking to other guys I'm surprised they don't touch her. She is witty and smart. When we make out, he moans... It's like he's eating something delicious. And when she finishes, she's all shaking. I'm not nice, but if what I feel for her isn't love, then it's damn close to love He seemed very attractive to me. - That's the power of the media. Just because a women's magazine says she sleeps in red pajamas Go. Spava go. And I sleep naked, but it doesn't turn you on. - Because you're not famous I will be more famous than him one day. -When you become famous, uspaljivaæe me. I had to prove it to all the bastards who laughed at me that I am a talent who waited and waited for his opportunity. Whenever Helen wanted to leave me, I won her over promises of success, but my time was running out. Financiers don't trust scripts with my name on them. Regardless of whether they like it and whether it smells like making money. But with the signing of Colin Rodgers, my career will take off. As soon as she climbs on deck, the 16-year-old gets everyone busy. Finally, the captain pulled her aside. They are 200 m from the coast. l tells her, choose, me or the crocodiles. She jumps into the water and swims towards the shore. And the crocodile... He slides behind her. She almost reaches the shore... A crocodile attack is more believable than a shark attack. How about a blanket? - It sounds very commercial. What will it be called? Beast Wars ? -Attack at night. Nothing is definitively determined . The captain can jump and get killed I want you to be my co -writer You will be named as the lead. We will produce the film ourselves and control the money and filming. We don't need twilight panoramas or bad actors. You know which movie has the best cast? Farland horse. And mine had good actors. - Who hired Johnson in the Days of Vajna and Vitlam? -lain Ross. He looks great in rock videos, but bad on film. The audience knows that he doesn't know how to act , that's why they didn't watch him. - They didn't? The film covered the costs. - l earned. - He could have done much more. The script was great. He was awarded in... -Berlin. For nothing else, just for the scenario. It's one of the best scenarios we've had, and the audience did not flock to the cinemas. You know why? Because crazy llane took a grotesque actor. She lives in abundance, and you in the backwaters. She enjoys the view, but you have a gift. Attack at night. What do you say? I'm not sure it's for me You'll be smarter tomorrow. What are you currently working on? Recent history? 2nd St. war? -Yes, why? You know McBride from Channel 10? -Not. - We are good friends. He says that 2. St. war always passes. Theme? - Coast Guard A group of people saves us from invasion by following the enemy. It would pass. Gary accepts such projects. - I'm making it for the cinema World War II doesn't go well in the cinema, but it's always a hit on TV. You can make a miniseries. Gary will sign the pre-contract, we will settle the matter at the bank and we can shoot in August. I envisioned it as a movie. - It 's an epic story, it doesn't stop at 2 o'clock He was a player, and a very callous human being. But he left an impression with his self-confidence and energy. He found himself in an industry where even fools succeed overnight. Lucas and Spielberg were ridiculed in their beginnings, and now they are millionaires. He radiated potential. If it doesn't work, I'll get rid of it. Television? A mini-series of 6-7 episodes. I know, you care, but you don't see the story in guarding the coast. Members of the Coast Guard fought with the guerrillas. My uncle told me about them. - Let his influence on you. I have to sell the idea to primitive bosses who cares why the average viewer would watch that shit? But you can certainly sell them a quality idea. If you want to do something new, I have the perfect project for you. Heard about Tonoj Sanzar?-His children died in an amusement park He's crazy, isn't he? - Everything but that. He has convincing evidence that is the so-called the accident was organized by the mafia to close the park and bought the land for new construction Corruption does not excite me. That's corny. - Interesting story. I want you to deny it. Unfortunately, it didn't get me through. - I really paid a fortune. I want the Coast Guard to work. - The horror. - I didn't even write it. It will fail. - Then I will make the film myself. Are you going to produce it? -That. Don't be funny. What experience do you have? - It's time for me to learn. You know what goes with that? - Anyone smart could manage. Is it? - It's time for me to take responsibility for creative decisions Are you unhappy with my decisions? -Someone. -By which? Johnson's role in Days of Vine and Whitlam. - She's great. He was frozen. - Stiff? - just like that. I'm sorry that my nose said that at the test screening. They even said that it was the only choice. Everyone gets carried away at the beginning of the movie I'm sorry that you reject the project . Whoever takes it on will be famous. I read hundreds of manuscripts a year. Some have an idea, others promise, but this one appears only every five years. A new writer. This is worth working for five years. Is he that good? -Brilliant. -Autobiographical? -Yes of course. But no trace of self-pity. - Thank God we got him. It's not accidental. I followed him when she first started writing. I didn't even doubt it. Okay, I'll read it tonight. Ian Vol. You know what he said? Imagine. Black people don't pass. -What? Books by black writers, about their problems, are not sold. Because they blame white people too much. I couldn't believe my ears Dinner is in five minutes. He lied about where she was for the weekend. She never lied before. - She started. - Wasn't she at home? You really are a funny father. - But you're not. If you declare that you work like me, that you assume fatherhood to work, I will call the journalist and ask for a denial. - I am shopping. I need to attach the list to your clothes before shopping. I think about everything. - I will think while you work Have you ever talked to the butcher? Nice guy, but tiresome. He wonders if I shop in the morning because I live with a steward. Let him think what he wants. -Why? - Homosexuality is not evil. Except I'm not gay Speaking of which, stop telling Sam that no one knows their sexual orientation before she grows up, but by no means should she be ashamed You are prejudiced against homosexuals. - I don't have any at all. I just don't want him to feel guilty if he's heterosexual We carry 15 mil. g. old gene. I want them to continue to multiply. Where was Penny? - In the disc. How did you find out? - A 23-year-old German tourist came here looking for our daughter. - What did he want - She offered herself to him on the podium. We thought you were studying with Manon - The whole company goes to the disco. Penny. You are only 1 3 years old. -1 4. -Soon I will have 1 5. You're still too young for disco. Dealers operate there. You just have to tell them to leave. - So they're operating? Open? You think I'm stupid enough to take drugs? You really believe me. Penny, come back here now. We have to do something. - I canceled her pocket money. That will really freak her out. - Shall I lock her in the closet? This is serious. It moves between dealers and pimps. If he keeps going like this, he'll end up on the street. - Take it into your own hands if you are so worried. And solve Sam along the way. - What about Sam? Sixth grade racketeers. - Racketeers? You go to school next time. I have enough problems anyway. The novel of that black woman. - Please , don't call her black. And how? A woman who doesn't have our complexion. - Call her by her name. I forget him. - Learn. Her name is Kate Mitchell, and the book is... Black anger. - Did you see? -What? -Prezriv performance. Terrible title. -Thank you. I came up with it. Just because she's black doesn't give you the right to write her off. I didn't. And you're better. Her writing has power. While mine is manly and flabby. - Yours doesn't have her power. -Thank you. I'm tired of running a family. You're too busy with yourself to pledge himself, so I feel like I'm in a trap. I know the dream behind that threat. The room where he writes short stories for women about a husband so stupid she had to sew him lists and leaned so much to the right that he voted for Labour. Disaster. They played it in the multiplex. He only earned 7000. Not the first day, the first week. Did you look at it? The character says I don't know why we 're doing this, and so does the audience. At two. Just one more call. Mike fascinated me. It's like I've discovered a new kind of swindler. Bob? Are you up for a drink? At 1 8:30 He made endless appointments Have you heard about Terry's movie? A total disaster. He made 3000 over the long weekend. Disaster. It was important to him that every film failed. If anyone has a look Mike and his friends would cut him to pieces. Teri's movie doesn't work ? -Disaster. He could have asked me to write him a good script, but he didn't. Producers do not address him because they have a similar ego. And I had to crawl. Terry, how's your movie doing? It has been withdrawn from distribution? Too fast. Are you okay? See you I wondered if I would last. I was sick to my stomach. I drank a triple dose of pills, without any effect. Hello. -Good morning. Are you Mike? I wanted to say hi to you last night, I thought I was bothering you. Did you spend the night with us? - Yes, let's start work early. You're not working today, are you? - Yes, and only here. Always the same shit. - Leave them on the table when you read them. I like to take a look before the kids get up. Making coffee? - Yes. - Can I have one strong with two sugars? Are you married? - I was, twice. - Now you haven't? The woman he doesn't want to marry. What do you like? - A little bit. - She is not employed? Freelancer, PR Gets one job a month, and that one messes up. -Does it bother her that you think about her like that? Probably. - I'm glad to hear that. But she is a woman, which cannot be said for other dragons in Sydney What do you mean, she's a woman? - She is beautiful, she dresses nicely, she doesn't scream like a wild cockatoo, she's funny, sometimes she goes crazy, and it's wicked sexy. That's your definition of a woman? - Yes. And I stick to her. Isn't it a bit limited? -Some women like to have power. I don't mind, unless I am subjected to them. He's terrible. - He drinks an awful lot. - I didn't know there were still such What woman would put up with him? - The one who enjoys being a slave. Why are you working with him? - I'm producing the Coast Guard, I need help He is your co-writer. - He writes what I tell him. - He will sign. Everyone will know that he didn't write anything. So far he's just trying. Why are you working with him? -Instills faith that I can produce on my own. You haven't complained about the line so far. - The Coast Guard disgusts her. I don't want to work with someone who doesn't believe in my work. Let someone else be rich. - Rich? - What a view he has. Already turned you around. He uses you. You think it's the other way around, but it's not I can take care of myself. The Coast Guard interests me as much as sex with a sick lesbian. I easily tried it, but I wo n't bore you. He knows how to write. Out of boredom, I started to read what was written and understood that arrogant bastard develops a story that keeps me engaged. The problem with this scene is that nothing is at stake. Two are talking. What's at stake? What? Nurse. The ship sank, but she grabbed the shore. The Japanese breaks through ours. Love at first sight. Boom. Boom? - Yes. Have you ever fallen in love at first sight? -I am not. -I am A few weeks ago. I met a girl at a party. Tall, slim, beautiful. I would kill for such. -How it's called? I didn't ask her. - You would kill, and you didn't ask for the name? - I'm married When will they have sex? - Who? - Ray and the nurse. -I can not. They may be on the island for years. If she gets pregnant, everything will be fine. But that doesn't rule out oral sex. Let's insert a scene in which he kisses her from her toes up. Then it stops Forget it. - It would work. -I do not want to. Bad idea. Dobrodoli. It's mom. - You should study. Did you feed the dog? Not for a moment, but immediately. Aeo, mama. -Æao. Hello, honey. Did you have a nice day? I'm so angry I can't even talk about it. lan refuses to publish the book? - The children must be hungry. They didn't, we ordered a pizza. I know you don't understand how much I care about the book. -I understand. I'm not completely callous. - I was on the verge of tears. I'm going to quit. - You won't. He will change his mind. - He won't. He has no guts and doesn't care. I didn't mean to hurt you. You write beautifully. I can't expect Keta's passion from you, you live comfortably. What's up? - As if they said, I don't think you're that ugly. I saw your parents , so everything is clear to me. Good morning. Hey. - Yes. What is Kate? - Her boss won't publish the book she was pushing. What is it about? - About a black woman who wants to succeed in life. What is her boss's name? -l. Vol He says black people don't pass. What is the name of the writer? - Kat Mitchell. 'Morning. linen Vol. - I hear that you will not publish Kathy's book. What's Up? -Ket Honey. Who is it? -It's not important. Listen. Many think that she is one of the most important writers today It is an important book about black people. We heard you won't publish it because you think black people don't pass That is a racist statement. - That 's not true. - We think so Who are you? - Don't let me come and drag the journalists. Jesus. What the hell are you doing? I raise his pressure a little. Why didn't you call me? - I was busy. - What? - By cleaning. Guess what happened. -What? - Ian received the call black guerillas . They'll bomb his building if he doesn't publish the work. Did you just see the panic? Great - Did you call the police? - No He is afraid of negative publicity. - Will it be published? - In 3000 pieces. What's wrong with you? - I forgot the powder, broccoli and apricots. They were on the list, but I went to the bakery first. I told myself, don't forget the apricots, but I forgot them. I'm sorry for being rude to the children. Everything looks bleak to me when I have a problem at work. - No, children are terrible. What is happening to me? -What? - That's what our daughter is asking her friends It is very accessible. - I am surprised that they are still virgins. They are very refined virgins. - Just don't lose heart. It depresses me that it sounds interesting to me. When we were gossiping about other people's sex? - Ironic, huh? We can fuck every day and they get more excited than we do when thinking about petting. I didn't know it was that bad. - That's how it is in every marriage. I'm not much better either. I was watching Rajan's daughter. I didn't know what was happening when Sarah Miles stood in front of that Englishman and started whining She acted. I can not do it. Do you want to try? Are you okay? - Stomach problems. - The project is good. They will agree. Talk to him as if you were friends. Malcolm. - Colin. -Mike McCord. -I am glad. - Also I often go to the fair. - You read that shameful article, didn't you? Because of my sin, I was declared president of the friends of the opera. And opera needs friends. Opera calms people down. - I would bother them for less money. Have you read the script?-Synopsis honestly , it's not a project for us. How can you say that? You only read the synopsis. The story is good. About how a handful of people saved Australia. But young people do not know at all that Australia was threatened The rest of the world barely knows we exist. So, you only work on projects that have nothing to do with history. Only surviving members of the Guard would be delighted with the story. It means that three people would watch the movie. All my previous scripts have brought you money. Read it. Da ga proèitam? Od same pokriti mi se zeva. Those people risked their lives so that we could sit here. Many died. - The Japanese cut off their heads and ate them. They saved Guadalcanal, he saved the Pacific.-l Dž. Kennedy Can Americans act? -Not. - I can. All but one. That way you might be able to pass. - But they were Australians We finally got the money. Malcolm got rid of Colin. Cut. -You are OK? - Where are the others? I said he must be bleeding like he was cut open. Put him a plastic bag full of pig offal. Everything has to fall out of him. See him. He should be fighting in the rainforest, not lying around. Turn him into a ruffian. To make it look real. get it dirty put lice in his hair. This is a film about real events. They survived because they stayed sober. - He's just sleeping. You're bullshitting. I've been researching for two years, I know what they did and what they didn't They shaved, washed, had soap. - But not the hair dryer. Jesus, leave them alone. Do you know what realism is? Cut. - Mike, get out of the water. When you submerge his head...See Let him go. - He is fighting for his life. That's realism. For God's sake. Thanks, Mike. He leaves the set. Get lost. - What do you mean? I'm a co-producer. Critics praise him. A catastrophe is ahead of us. Wonderful. Read it. A brilliantly shot, emotional and poetic film. When critics write sensitive , it means slow and superior. You will see the viewership results. Call them again. - They will call us as soon as they get the information. Why are you worried? He's wonderful . I cried. You always cry. - That young man, what's his name? -Gary. - Yes, he... Blondes. I would like to have deep conversations with him. You can hardly speak. Mike McCord. Thank you. 1 3. - Impossible. Isn't it 30? No, 1 3. In Melbourne 1 4. 1 3%-tna gledanost. - Catastrophe To hell with the viewership. We know that trash gets ratings. In this business, you cannot sell the next project without viewership . We'll sell it. - crazy project. - We just experienced a fiasco. I wouldn't about the plans. - What project? -1 3%. I wouldn't talk about it. Colin and I have good ideas. -E.g? - I don't want to talk about it. Any ideas? For miniseries? - No, for a show like Dallas. We could make it in the world. -Dallas? - We're just talking. If we sell it to the Americans, we will make millions. Since when are you interested in millions? - What's wrong? - That's really sad. What? - He came as an artist. You're turning into a businessman. We recorded a work of art. Nobody wants to see him. -Yes. Hello. I'm sorry I'm late. Colin and Kate. Party girl. Hello. -Hello. - Oh, impossible. It looks like you're not celebrating. This vision, this ravishing beauty , cannot be the Mother's. The gods are unfair, but certainly not that unfair. What are the results? 1 3. - God, the series is so bad She is good. Too good. I mean, in a commercial sense . Not particularly commercial. Well? I will publish a book that will sell a few thousand copies. But in the long run it will be influential Majka and Kolina only pay if they achieve a good result. Until recently, Mike had good results. Not millionaires, hello noje pazoo na money. Why? For a house with a better view? For a new trip to Venice? I wouldn't mind a first trip to Venice. Not even against a better view. - I judged her well. She is a beautifully packaged materialist from the 80s for whom wealth is the ultimate goal in life. Laskam sebi da sam napredan i da mi žene nisu seksualni objects, but she is every man's living fantasy. You have to learn. -What? - between art and money. The two don't excite each other... er, they don't exclude each other. Why did I say excite? - Because I excite him. I like that. and the fact that he is discreet. It attracts me. If I could get rid of this fool, we would have fun. I wouldn't feel guilty about his wife. What a dragon That's how Melbourne affects people. Luckily, I wasn't there Shakespeare. - What about her? - He was making good money. It's not. - He had five houses. He was rich. If he were alive, I doubt he'd be writing a screenplay for Dallas. King Lear is Dallas 1 7th century. -King Lear is a masterpiece. lzvonote. Zeludaene tegobe. Let's go. - I never know when he's going to catch me. See you. I will accompany you. No need. - Hello. Why are you challenging her? - We didn't fight. - They'll bother him to dissolve the partnership with me. I'm gonna write a hit. And let him write artistic scenarios as much as he wants. Colin, I'm just astounded. - What? - With your cooperation. and thinking about producing a soap opera. - Not really soap operas. All American series are soap operas. What's happening to you? It happens to me as I get older. I'm starting to have nightmares. That I will end up as a loser whose scripts no one will want It's not paranoia. There is no such thing. H. Lawson, our best writer, he ended up in prison for debts. In the end he begged. Did anyone care? It's not. But that won't happen to me. I'm tired of sending scripts and waiting, and no one calls. Strong calls for someone to say - we didn't get to read it. Writing is terribly humiliating. I've had enough of him. I want to be a producer, to have money and power. To call me I'll tell the secretary that I'm busy and I'll call later Why shouldn't I have money and power? or a house on the shore, as well as other fools playing producers. I know how to make a movie with a message. I want to create a fun one product and become terribly powerful and fantastically rich. Producer? If I wasn't upset, I would laugh. - Right? Why? You can't even go shopping without help. - What does it matter? You forget our birthdays and every other meeting. Your card is in the red, they are threatening us with a power cut, etc. because you always forget to pay. - Production work includes much more than thoroughness. - And the fiasco with the extras? I wrote - 40 Japanese emerge from the rainforest. Mike added zero Most people would have noticed the mistake before the Japanese hordes arrived. It's Mike's fault. Are you going to work with him again? - If it gets sorted out. Did you tell him that? - He knows I'm not satisfied. I know when you are not satisfied. You stamp your foot and clench your fist. But it took me 18 years to realize that. He is so callous in order not to notice an irritated tiger preparing to attack. He knows I'm not happy. - Koline. Face reality Mike is a swindler from the bottom. You are a writer. You might end up like beggar but that's a risk you have to take. You're distracted because your mind wanders. You wake up at night and tell me the stories you dream. You can't be something you 're not. - Always the same stories. Let them trample you. - You can't be something you don't look like. The producer must be ruthless. - I can do that. I can be the most ruthless bastard in this town. You are as ruthless as a toothless cat. - You are wrong. You wouldn't believe how ruthless I can be. I know. Two undercover cops . Drunkards, prostitutes. Only the cops are not typical. They are young, they dress modernly. Everything would be in pastel colors Action, car chase. l with a deadline in the background. - You're late, it's Miami Vice No, it's different. - For what? Good. Then the story about a divorced business woman with a child. He hires a housekeeper who also has a child. - Where did that come from? It is similar to an American series. lli series about DJ. - Who sits and plays records. - There's stuff here. Arab tourists come and take over the radio station. Why bother flying to occupy a radio station? To kidnap the DJ and make demands - What kind? That it doesn't fit anymore? Give us the Arab prisoners. - Why do we keep them? We'll work that out later. It 's the idea that matters. - the ldeja is shabby. Let's come up with something original. Are you still working? -Two coffees, honey. -Good. Black with one sugar cube? -That. - No, without sugar. Yes, I'm not thinking at all. Brain on pasture. I don't remember such things. -Neither do I. -How was today? Catastrophic. I'm promoting some bad American comedian Problems. - When I agreed, he wanted to take off my blouse. He was drunk. During the interview , he was lying on the floor and shouting. The journalist jumped on him. she came here to sort him out. Why didn't you tell him she thought he was a genius? It's hard to spread misinformation when you're being raped in the middle of a crowd. If you didn't dress provocatively, you wouldn't have such problems. Two coffees. Možes li da ih skuvaš a da te ne siluju? Why does it suffer? She deserves someone sensitive and smart. She deserves me, but I don't know how to offer myself to her. I didn't want to break up the marriage, but only a passionate love affair. If she rejects me, she will tell Mother, and if she accepts, Kate will find out and go crazy, how lucky I am. - Alive. I'll be back on Friday. I hope everything goes well We want to make sure they promote the book appropriately. After so much trouble with printing. Hi baby. Come on. Sreenus. Mike McCord. - Yes. You collaborate with Colin. -On some projects. Good. -And you? - l am working on some projects. -Good. I liked the Coast Guard. - She could have been better. She lacks momentum in the story. -That. - The second half is better. A good part is mine.-You wrote the second half?-Together with him But Colin calmed down. -The second half is interesting. I had to fight for it. Colin avoids feelings. Nothing excites him. - a trick. - This can be seen in his writing I'm just emphasizing sensitivity. The second half was emotionally stronger. When I write a scene, I only ask myself what is at stake. If it's nothing, then it's just small talk. - Makes sense, kid Mike. While you were working together, how much emotion did you put into the films Very much. he easily never thanked me for that. Do you remember Dan Vajna and Vitlam? -Good movie. Johnson was a rock star, producers offered him roles. He rejected everyone except me. And then last year Kolin attacked me that I compromised the film because Kuper was a singer. Imagine. He attacked you? - I told him he was an ungrateful pig. Are you free or busy with Kolin's projects? I always find time for a good enough project. I have a very good project. We need to talk about it. - I'll call you. I finally understood. Cooperation with Colin leads to nothing. He has no sense of commercialism, nor will he have one. I also doubt the line. It is more poisonous than all the snakes in the zoo. But she has a reputation. If word gets out that I'm collaborating with her, I will start getting real offers. Columns. -Hello. - Hello. Kate isn't here? - He's on his way. Did you like the movie? You can't miss his. It is extraordinary. About a guy who is crazy about his wife even though she is unstable. She falls in love with a truck driver and leaves with him. Husband cries for 2 min. And the camera is still. I burst into tears. A brave Australian film. - We wouldn't record it. Ours only want power, money, sex, horses, crime, crocodiles I know. Terrible. But Mike and I write according to that recipe. For the audience. To avoid commercial pressure. - And mate The Ministry of Culture is monitoring it. He almost ended up in prison because the main character in his last film is a corrupt politician. I'm going to tell you something I shouldn't . - Please, tell me. I don't think the cooperation between you and Majko benefits anyone. -What? Mike is a master of power, sex, crimes, crocodiles. I don't hold it against him, we all have to earn money. But when I watch a film like Poles, I wish for a better world. In which I can say what I think and mean what I say. You can write such films. And it should. I know, it sounds corny, but you're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen. When you showed up that night, I was stunned. You must have noticed. - Yes, strong attraction. Really strong. And I stood with my mouth open. I didn't give in to the feeling. I thought I was wrong. Why do we panic when we should ignore caution? What are we going to do about it - Let's go to the hotel. - To the hotel. Yes Are there any nearby? - We will find some. - do I have a car? I have. Where is the hotel nearby? My brain stopped. No, I'm not in a car. We'll take a taxi. There is one hotel... But it is far away. Art Hyman. Have you heard of him? -Not. -Actually, we can't go there. We'll call a taxi. There is no hotel. - I'm a car lover. I'm in the car. I must be going crazy. Imagine, I'm still in the car. Let's go. And Mike? You go first. I'll get out somehow. - Let's meet in front of the entrance See you soon. Colin... - You are so beautiful. The writer left his wife I will never forgive him. -Are you OK? The writer lost custody of the children - Do not visit us. Nasty. We don't want to see you anymore. Fuck off. Colin Rogers - Slave of Love Šta is joy? Zalovaš mo vrt. How do I... -How what? Pišče's daughter acquitted for possession of heroin Smoking is $20. Perversions. Fuck off. We will enjoy it. I ca n't give up. I don't want that. The screenwriter was killed What's up? Not. - Helen, I'm sorry. - Forget it Decline. You're crazy. Boe... Shit. In the 70s, destroying child marriages was called personal development. Now we know that it is a nicer name for self-indulgence. What's up? Kate... What are you doing with your life? While you were gone, I met Polish director who creates masterpieces under pressure. I have all the freedom and I write shit. You don't have. The boss won't script without sex and sensations. That's my excuse for this kind of work, but isn't that just an excuse? Couldn't I get stuck anymore? Surely there are rich artists. It's my duty to find them Why not try? Because you want money and power. -Not. - Last week you wanted to. Well, now I don't want to. -Good. Do you want to hear my news? Crni gnev entered the final of the literary competition. Are you going to London? -That. Briefly. We fly first class. -Me? -Kat Mitchell and me. I've never flown first class. - It's an important competition We will sell well. Spielberg bought the film rights to T. Connelly's book. Wasn't Black Wrath supposed to matter only in the long run? Spielberg? What kind of movie would they make in Hollywood? Aliens abduct natives, take them to their peaceful planet Where are those blankets? What happened to them? -Nothing. Thai Airways. Hostesses in traditional clothes will welcome you who will offer you champagne and crabs. I'm glad. I will finally enjoy luxury. - You are going to a city full of homeless people I can't do anything in the short term. - Because you enjoy the plane. The homeless won't be better off if I don't travel first class. If you sell the ticket, buy a cheap one and send them the difference, it will be. Whenever I go, you attack. - I'm not attacking. Only, your moral principles disappear because of one expensive card That book is my great success. Be more generous. - Success? Look at the competition. I will be the first foreign producer who will sell the series in prime time on American TV. You're bursting at the seams. A while ago you were talking about the Polish director and quality movies, and now you are bragging about selling junk to the USA What is going on in your head? If only he knew. Let's start with a close-up of the engine ignition. That went out of fashion with Goli in the saddle. What are you doing? - One blanket. - Which one - We'll get back to her later. If ignition is out of fashion, what do you suggest? We zoom in on the helmet, then zoom down the exhaust pipe. - Good, write. Before Brad goes, let him turn around and say... - No dialogue The intentions are clear. - I wanted to... - I wouldn't be able to hear myself because of the noise Are we writing a cartoon script? In 20 minutes they say 1 or 2 words. It's a series in the footsteps of the 80s that needs to be told with pictures. We share 99% of our DNA with chimpanzees. Communication makes 1% of the difference. They tried to translate with a computer The soul wants, but the body won't from English to Russian and received incomprehensible reading. What do you want to say? How will we get to know the characters if they don't speak? It's like we're writing about chimpanzees. Before a character attracts you, you have to know how he speaks and thinks. How he justifies his actions raises important questions about life, death and the meaning of everything How he looks at the irony of life in an endless and incomprehensible universe. - What do you want him to say? Let's check what it's all about. Do you really think the Americans will buy the rights? -That Did you send them the script? -That. - Did they get back to you? Nothing concrete, but they are interested in what is interesting to them. ldeja is 5 years old. It's Australia's Miami Vice But with many innovations. One of the cops is a Ph.D. Astrophysicist. And the other is a chef and former surfing champion. Shit. -Like Miami Vice. That's stylish shit. This is bullshit through thick and thin. I don't see the difference. That's why you have the same chance as a monkey writing Hamlet I think you are wrong. - I would be happy to admit a mistake. We will help you if you sign a pre-contract. Mike, we're interested in the screenplay you're working on with Lane Ross. Send it to me when you're done. What kind of script are you writing with llejn? - About the accident in the amusement park. She said that she offered it to you, but you refused. - I don't see that movie It's a strong story. It will pass. We will sell this. He's not the only financier in town. Dude, it's over. Marriages can be horrible. It 's even worse if your partner doesn't like it. You got promoted? A little more and you're at the top. I got Lan's old office on the 56th floor. I can see the whole port I don't know when I will write. I enjoyed it. Colin has already experienced fame Now it's my turn. - Have you been drinking? I drank some. You were right , Sydney is the most exciting city I'm not proud of it now, but I enjoyed it then. I have work. I want to finish this. I said it would make a great movie. Great idea, very happy. Teri wants me to write the screenplay for his next movie. You can't take on new commitments, you're already working on five films. It's now or never, baby. - You're going to kill yourself. If you want to succeed, you have to commit. - Cut back on the pills. You will melt your stomach. - In these two months, I signed the contract in value greater than all in the last ten years. I know. Mike... It's wonderful. What? - The first logo. Anything worse than this would be an insult to you. Some poor women treated me like shit. I just want to thank you. This is the only way I know. I'm touched, believe me. But I'd rather be with you in the apartment than enjoy the view while you are in intensive care.-It started for the first time in my life. We take. It is OK. I'm done. You'll get it in a few days. Just to print it. No problem. The problem was that the accumulated obligations should be done. I had no shortage of great ideas, but I couldn't put them on paper at all. Some circuit in my head was changing my golden ideas to shit. And I was within reach of the success I dreamed of. And crocodiles with gaping jaws were waiting for me below. There had to be some way out. Out of 400 films in the last 15 years, only one was successful in the USA. We don't try. We have to establish a big production house and work on many projects. Everything must be at the world level. World scripts, stars, directors. The world is a global village. Nationalism is dead. We have better climate than California and the technology is cheaper. Our actors can play secondary roles. If they have strong accent, going to speech exercises. Let's finally admit it that our accent is bad because we don't open our mouths enough. This has been going on since the settlers, they kept flies in their mouths. And that is disastrous for the sale of our products today. What are you saying, Mike? Send me to LA I'll find actors and arrange deals. We will share the profit half and half. If I fail, you lose your ticket How much do you need for the first phase? -One hundred thousand. Fifty. Twenty, for starters. Have you read Anatomy of a Screenplay Anatomy?. - About a guy who knows what he wants and how to get it. We need such a scenario . -Of course. We're leaving in two minutes. Pack a raincoat. -Yes I am. Jesus. Look at. Malkolm Benet and Majk MekKord? Contracted projects of $100 million for next year? What will Malcolm get into with Mike? - Why did I come in? They will sell everything in the industry. - He will make films for the world market without sacrificing the Australian spirit. -uses partnership in the Coast Guard, even though he barely wrote a resume. For the first time I feel as if I could kill. - Everything will be found out They won't. Whoever gets there with so little work must be a genius. Thank you for coming. -How's it going? Good. I took out the third mortgage on the apartment, I have to reduce expenses by 20,000. Life is exciting. Is the script progressing? -Scenario? You mean the one about Sanzar? -That. Not. - Mike hasn't finished it yet? Thanks for alerting me to him. - It's not up to me to... If a friend of yours wants to throw $20,000 in the wind, Aren't you going to warn him? You think I love paying mortgages The script is bad? -Scenario? I have barely 1 4 pages. I couldn't warn you, I didn't read his works. - I did They are etched in my memory. Okay, scumbag, game over. No, she just started. - I knew, but you don't know that I hold the strings. I'm relieved. - Anyone who doesn't pay for it would be relieved. I started to have nightmares that he had a gift. I couldn't explain his rise to the top. - It won't take long. They probably will. I would like to write about T. Sanzar if you are still interested. I sold the rights. -Whom? - To Mike McCord. Are you kidding me? -Where luck goes.-Jeso lo heard what kind of projects they are preparing Drama about lesbian nuns Why did you sell your rights bastard? That was the only way I could get my 20,000 back. Why did I come to Sydney in the first place? The sea in the harbor is not blue, but green. Cold and repulsive. The Emerald City. Everyone here is looking for a solution to the problem, and they find demons within themselves. This city sets them free. Because he is evil. Glitter, money, fashion, corruption, compromises... Intelligence, professionalism, the measure of commitment. There is both good and bad You choose, but you only have yourself to blame. - But there is no forgiveness or mercy The city tramples on fallen heroes and robs them along the way. There is no other Then come back to Melbourne. You will not die because of your demons. They wouldn't know what to suggest to you Daughter happy with shy children almost for compensation from the Institute. I tell her that she is being taken advantage of, but she doesn't want to do anything else She grew up here. If you intend to stay here, write a good screenplay or we'll both be out of a job. American movies will destroy all the value of my books. When the movie starts, the sales of the book will increase many times. And the book is the most important. - The film will make you famous in the world. I wrote a book for my people. - The offer is generous. I'm not looking for wealth and fame. - We can act as agents. They would sell the rights against my will? - The board of directors is waiting for me. This is too good an offer to refuse. -Offer. Nothing more No one mentions the book, not even my people. Can I stay at Denny's for the weekend? - No. Did you see her on the news? And. - Hysterical. Wouldn't it be smarter to wait for the result of the competition? before the sale of film rights? - He won't win the competition. lan asked us to accept the offer.-Who did you sell the rights to The movie will certainly be terrible, but it will triple the sales of the book And it will have a lasting impact. - You didn't sell them to them, did you? They offered twice as much as others. The pressure is great. How can I explain the rejection of the offer because I don't like Majk Then you're not going to London. -Why? - Because you won't win the prize. We're not quite sure. - Your boss 's secretary called. -Why? They reserved a place for both of them. -lan decided to go when Kat gave up. - Great. You're not worried, are you? - Why shouldn't I be? - Have you seen him? He looks like a young Keri Grant. - He looks like a garden gnome Let him grow up. We have a strictly business relationship. He actually looked like Grant. And he showed interest... I wouldn't mess with him. Colin, I don't like it either that Mike got the rights, but that's how it is in the commercial world. There is some justice in that. Without Mike, the book would not have been published. Are you busy? -Not really. Are you writing a screenplay for llein? - Yes. About what? - About the victims of business greed. - Did you secure the money? I'm not. - You will have a hard time finding such a project . - But I will find him. Set in Australia, it sends a message, the characters are not always in the car, and sometimes they even speak. I have something interesting. Americans went crazy for the Black Rage. I'm surprised. -I'll admit it, one of our writers is working on it, but it is still far from the goal. - Do you want me to remake it? You will get 150,000 if you push the final version. It will be a hit. The first screenwriter, an American, did not do his job properly. You could make a name for yourself in the US with this. - Why are they interested? problems of our natives? - We have changed the place of business. The action takes place in Tennessee, and the characters are black. Do you know why I'm not interested? - The story is universal. A poor black woman becomes a human rights lawyer. There are great differences between our natives and the blacks of the USA We are all human. This is the age of the global village. -Not really. Centuries of separatism will not disappear because TV teaches children tolerance towards others. Nationalism is very destructive. It causes wars and death. You set the story of T. Sanzar in Wyoming? - To Nebraska. And you could use it there. You're a real whore. You are a whore. You sold your soul to the highest bidder. Everything for money We can't go back. I'm risking my health to save the industry I want to move 1 00 mol. for the movie. Part of it will end up with us. So why am I a whore? - Those are our stories. We have the rights to them We have to be important enough to have stories written about us. Otherwise, we will think that it is better to speak with someone else's accent elsewhere I don't understand what you want to show. Curve? Where did I get the right to judge? Would you be so happy if I sold Poroke in the US? Thinking about moving Black Rage to the US, everything started to match to some extent. Because of $1 50,000. Dad, do you know how to solve this? Fractions. They are inconvenient. Honesty woke up in me. Some deep feeling of patriotism But I was held back by the thought of working for Majko. Okay, I'm a whore. Some of us have no choice. -I arrived. Kolin turned down the 1 50,000 job. But I understand why he hesitates to work for you. - I don't understand. For two days, I convinced Amer to agree, but he refused the offer To spite me. That's insane. - And lesbian nuns? I pushed them through last week - That. You had to change the story? One of them must be just a latent lesbian. Crazy. The point is that many nuns are tormented by pangs of conscience. If you did my job, you would realize that I have performed a real miracle. I would like to see the truth here and there.-The only important truth is what they pay. If they want me to replace the nuns with astronauts and lesbians with doughnuts, will get a story about astronauts and doughnuts. I satisfy their wishes. The market. I know, she's dirty, but I'm paying attention to it. If you don't like it, go to the old apartment. A very warm welcome. - I'm sorry you didn't win. I knew we wouldn't, but I didn't expect such a welcome. You almost didn't get it. I wanted to be cool and reserved Did you feel bad without me? -Terribly. Purchase without a list, a traumatic experience, and our daughter is a dragon. What's Dorèester like? - Overrated. And the garden gnome? We barely saw each other. He found himself a native woman. - A black woman? An English woman. Nice to see you again. - It's nice to be here again. lan actually found me, but Kolin doesn't mind what he doesn't know I got promoted, cheated on my husband and the marriage is in balance again. How's work? - I am writing the second version. No sign of the money. Maybe it's all in vain. Why shouldn't I write for Americans like others? Who cares if we stop making our own movies? Do you work in film? - Yes, I write scripts. - For which movies? A long way without a goal, Days of Vine and Whitlam, Heroes of the Dardanelles. Heroes of the Dardanelles? My favorite movie. I watched it 1 or 2 times. Children are always looking for it in the video store. When the major says- Clear? We got the order. We're going. Remember who you are. Great. And the soldier who drives the dagger with the ring into the ground? It touches me every time. You wrote it? -That. Are there any good interlocutors? - If there were, we wouldn't be here. You finally made a movie? -That. - What are the criticisms? -Good. I read the one in the Herald. - That's the only bad one. I wanted to look at him . He played briefly. - Two months. -Two? If I wanted longer, I would have written Crocodile Dundee. It will not pay off for investors. - We hope to sell abroad. Good luck. -Americans do n't really praise Nuns. We signed preliminary contracts for 6 million. $. - You are reducing production It's getting harder for us, but we'll pull through. - At the expense of Black Wrath. The success of a poor black woman is news here, but not in the US. Now you will have a little more difficulty selling the new film. - It's always difficult. Why do they always call him? Why do they invite him to parties? If he knew how much they despised him, he would never come here. I can't even hate him anymore. I pity him. His film will not go well in the USA. - There is room for his films. I liked it. I wish newspapers kept critics with the taste of the audience, and not to write eulogies to such losers. The only thing that makes me angry is how much he earns. I don't want to be rich. I'm just sad that we're throwing money away on shit while for serious films we have to beg and collect money.
