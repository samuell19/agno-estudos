[ guitar ] [ Latin music playing ] Are you going nowhere fast? Do something for yourself. If you're listening to this ad, you have time on your hands. Turn it into something positive. Night school. Job interests. Career advancement. Training in computers. Options you never dreamed of. Or maybe you just want to expand your knowledge. Night school is for you. Isn't it time you did something with your life? [ siren ] [ punches landing ] Man: Uhh! [ men shouting ] [ punches landing ] Man: I'm gonna rip your heart out! Hey, coach. It's a hell of a fight. Danny, I've got some bad news for you. What is it? What, I'm not getting a new uniform? That's okay. I can handle it. No. I'm not in the starting lineup. That's what it is. It's okay. I can handle it. No. Will you please let me finish? Don't tell me. You want me to drive the team bus next week. It's okay. I can handle it. I'm a team player. I'm not a whiner. No! No! God, you can't cut me! Man: Two-bit homo. Baseball's my life! I live baseball! I breathe baseball! You can't. Give me one reason. You can't hit. You can't throw. You can't catch. You can't run. You're the oldest rookie in the league. You're the only guy that spent nine years in the Single-A League. I can't carry you anymore. As a ballplayer, you're the worst I ever seen. But, Dad-- Daniel! This is the second saddest day of my life. The first was when you were born. I knew then that you were gonna be a fuck-up, and you'd never make it into the Major Leagues. I should have put you up for adoption, or maybe traded you off for a black kid. But no, your mother wouldn't let me. No bail money? I only had enough money to bail out the team. Oh, great. Maybe I'll call Joey Rasseli, get a loan. Oh, gee, kid. That kid is a shark. [ wolf whistle ] This is the first day of your new life. Man: I'm gonna break you in. You're mine, baby. Man: See you later, homo. Don't drop the soap! Man: Yeah? What do you want? Can I speak to Joey Rasseli, please? - Joey Rasseli. - [ man screaming ] Have you ever heard of him? - No. - Liar! He's the one you called about your bail money. I went to high school with him. Big deal. - Big deal, huh? - I'll handle it, Corbin! Joey Rasseli is a maggot. A worm. He's one of the slimiest and biggest narcotic suppliers in the whole city, man. He's even got a network of guys working the high school. [ man screaming ] Makes you want to puke. [ punches landing ] Danny, you're gonna become a narc. Work off that bail money. Get Rasseli for us. No way, guys. Not me. Danny, you are our first big lead, and we've been trying to get this mother for years. A narc? Sort of a narc. On spec. Every arrest you make, we take off 10 grand. If you get Rasseli for us, we'll drop all the charges. Do I have a choice? No. Do I get a gun? No, and you'll be completely on your own. Here. Oh, great. A narc on spec? No way. Absolutely not. You guys cannot do this to me. Listen, I'm a shortstop. I'm not an undercover cop. I'm putting my faith in the system. Due process. There's no way in the world that I'm ever gonna be a narc. One, two, three, testing. Okay, guys, I'm going in. - You owe me 10 bucks. - I'm not loaning you, man. - Fuck you. - 10-fucking bucks. I'm not loaning you nothing else, man. [ chuckles ] Hey, faggot. [ laughing ] Don't tease me. I'm gonna get my stash to me, right? I gotta have it. I gotta have it by Tuesday, you understand? All right. If you don't deliver, I'm gonna come over and bust your legs. Hey! Hey! Danny Warren! Yeah. What do you say? Good. Good. No! I didn't ask you how you doing. I said, "What do you say?" You okay, pal? Yeah. Oh, yeah. 'Cause you're looking tense. Me? Tense? No, no. A little worried. A little worried, that's all. You need a loan? Yeah. Sit down, Danny. Sit. Sit. Sit. Sit! Now, I got a job for you, Warren. Yeah. My wife's in night school. I want you to keep an eye on her. She's not to talk to nobody, you understand?! Now, you watch her! You do a good job, I'm gonna pay you. Well, Joey-- Oh, shit! [ screaming ] Swallow the pills, boss! God is love. God is love. Come on. God is love. - God is love. - Say it! Nobody calls him Joey except his wife and Father Damien. You got that? It's just in high school, I always sued to call him Joey. Get out! Okay. Your wife. Night school. I'll take care of it. Don't worry. Get out of here! That's right. Sit down. God is love. You want me to check your urine bag? Get away. Yo, Padre. Joey Rasseli. Yeah, I need to make a private confession to you and a rather large contribution. It's time for another Rasseli Wing. [ bell rings ] [ horn honks ] All right, gentlemen, now, listen up. As you know, due to the overcrowded situation within our legal system, you will be given a choice as to your sentence. Night school, where you will take the appropriate classes in order to obtain employment, or jail. All: Night school! Are you sure they're gonna let us into night school, man? We're students. They got to let us in night school. [ chanting ] Night school! Night school! Night school! Night school! [ yelling ] Do we get guns? [ yelling and laughing ] What about police protection? Night school! Night school! What about guns? [ pounds gavel ] Please, let's have some order. One person at a time. Mrs. Grant. Guns! Do we get guns? Mrs. Grant, what the hell are you talking about? Garbage men. Drug-street scum. Greaseball wops and beaners. Slimy Polacks. Neanderthal spearchuckers. Need I say more? I wouldn't let these scum-sucking douchebags step on my shit let alone teach them! We need guns! [ yelling, chatting ] [ Latin music playing ] [ singing in Spanish ] Offering free academic courses for criminals is not going to make me want to give up my evenings, nor is it going to subsidize this school. I was always under the impression that our job was to educate, not make money. Now, every faculty in this city that can facilitate a night school program has, except Jefferson Hawthorne. Miss Taylor, this institution has produced students that have gone on to become major heads of large corporations, Congressmen, some of the most distinguished citizens of our community, not murderers and rapists! [ chatting ] Man: Ugly! Damn! Man: You owe me! [ shouting ] [ chatting, indistinct ] Look, I don't know about the rest of you wussies, but I find it offensive that this whole thing's gonna be rammed down our throats. [ explosion ] Cheers! Drink up! Miss Taylor has organized many night-school projects, and she will also head this one. She will be here to provide you with support, suggestions, ideas for student-teacher relationships. Now, let's get out there and teach! Bait. Oh, God. Bullshit. Ridiculous. [ tires screech ] [ shouting ] Oh, my God. There's millions of them. [ laughs ] Man on P.A.: No gunfire during class hours. I wonder what class he's taking. Either home economics or hygiene something. [ explosion ] Man on P.A.: Gun was found in toilet. Please claim in principal's office. [ coughs ] You know I got a problem with schools. It's something about the nuns. Joey, there isn't any nuns here. Anyway, that was a long time ago, and nuns don't hurt little boys like that anymore. But you wait until you forget to do your homework and you're late for class-- And then whack! I mean, they have no mercy. - Mr. Rosseli? - What?! It's me, Danny. Take it easy. Oh. I thought you was a nun sneaking up on me. No, I ain't no nun. What's this with you and nuns anyway? This is my wife. This is Danny. He's gonna be keeping-- What the hell are you doing? Are you one of them funny guys or something? Hell-- Hell no. Good. Look, I got some business to take care of. Here. You keep an eye on my wife. If she talks to anyone, I want to know, you understand? You bet. She not to talk to no one, you got that? Hey, if anyone hits on her, I'm gonna hit you. Man on P.A.: Anyone caught urinating on the teacher's shoes will be suspended. I think I'm gonna go freshen up a bit. Take your time. Upstairs to the left. English class? English class? Let's see. English class. Yes. Math class. It's the sec-- The third door on the second floor. Will you please move your hands? Oh, thank you. Danny Warren. Uh...Katherine Taylor. What class do you teach? I'm not a teacher, I'm a counselor. Oh, thank you-- [ speaking Spanish ] ...for answering a prayer like this. If you don't mind my saying so, you know, you got a great body. Would you please be the mother of my children? I think we could-- we could have, like, 10. 11. Okay, 12 if you want. Not only are you ill-mannered, rude, ill-behaved, ill-bred, you're totally unappealing. You always make these snap judgments? Hey! You're the guy that was in jail with me. How you doing? Man: Whoo-hoo! Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey, what class does she teach? Katherine: Underwater ballet for the elderly. Yeah? Maybe I'm gonna take that. It's for the elderly. Well, she don't look that old. Hey, lady, I think I'm in love. Hey, you got any Mexican in you? Hey, would you like some? Maybe that creative writing class should be a good one for me, 'cause I've always had a heck of an imagination. Yeah, maybe. You know, that thing he said about jail... it was nothing. You don't have to explain. Danny. Uh, got to run. Excuse me, ma'am. Can you help me find my English class? Yes. English is in 201. Over there. Oh, thank you. Where's my class? - What class are you in? - My wrestling class. - Your which? - Wrestling. - Wrestling class. - That's right. [ bell rings ] See you outside of the gate in half an hour. Hi! Savor the bouquet. [ slurps ] Both: Night Train! Splendid! Okay, ladies, now, up with your left hand. Lift with your fingers, down again. Okay, a little faster this time. Up and down. One more time. Up and down. Right side. Up. Look at your fingers. And turn. Turn. Okay, left side. Up with the fingers. Turn. Very good. Now we're going to alternate hands. Right. Left. Lift with your fingertips. A little faster now, okay? Up. Down. Up. Down. Now let's go as fast as we can, okay? Go. Faster. Man: Welcome to the introduction to jewelry making. This is the finished product right here. This is the wax product which you start out with. - [ cracking ] - Uhh! Ohh! [ groans ] [ clears throat ] [ teacher continues ] Ow! - Ow. - Uhh. [ laughing ] Now, to ascend, attach this-- Aah! - [ splat ] -Oh! Uh, who's next? - Not me. - No way. Welcome to America. I hope you're all here legally. [ laughs ] Well... let's introduce ourselves, okay? My name is Murphy. Mr. Murphy. Why don't we find out what your names are? I've got a feeling that there's not a lot of Daves out there. [ laughs ] Welcome to creative writing. I know most of you have somewhat limited intelligences, but it's my job to wretch loose whatever little imagination you may have and focus it through your writing. How many of you can read and write? Uh-oh. You. You can't read? No, sir. Or write? No, sir. Then get out of my class! Is there something wrong with you? Are you deaf, too? I said get out of my class, you hear me? Get back to jail! And tell the office that you're too stupid for my class! That wasn't very neighborly of you. Mister, uh... Elmer. Mr. Elmer. Do you have a problem the way I'm running this class? [ belches ] Well? Do you? No, sir. Why don't we start with you? Yes, you, sir. What is your name? [ yelling in Chinese ] Well, I don't think I'm gonna remember all that at first. How about you, sir? What is your name? Name. You know? Me Murphy. You... Murphy? No, no, no, no. I'm Murphy. Me Murphy. You. Murphy. Doesn't anyone speak English here? I want each of you to come up to the blackboard and to write your name, followed by a brief sentence to describe yourself. We will begin now with...you. Come on. Show that sucker, Red. [ chuckles ] Yes, that's very fine. Now a brief sentence to describe yourself. Oh. You mean another one. [ chuckles ] I want you to talk. Do you understand? I say something and then you repeat it, okay? Let's try it. Hello. Hello. Say hello! All: Hello. Forget your name? Don't be an asshole. Of course not. I was trying to think of how to describe myself. [ softly ] How about fat and ugly? Pardon me? Hurry up! We can't stay here all day! We're all slipping into a coma! Come on! Okay. I'll have to take a little bit of work on it. Come on. Get back to your seat. Hurry up. What about you? You haven't been lobotomized yet, have you? Uh, I think I got the wrong class. Excuse me. Excuse me. All: Teacher. Hey, now! We're coming along really good now! My name is... My name is... Murphy. Murphy. Murphy. Murphy. Good. Good. Good! All: Good. Good. Good! No. No. No. You don't have to repeat that. No. You don't have to repeat that. I get the feeling that we're not wanted around here. Don't be ridiculous. It's just a feeling that I have, you know? Nonsense. Nonsense? Yes, absolute nonsense. Absolute nonsense? Come here. I have something I want to show you. All: Fuck off, you stupid foreign bastards! Mr. Murphy. May I see you outside for a moment, please? Shh. All: Shh. Great group. It's really going great. Really good. I mean, this is a genuinely fun group of people. Mr. Murphy, this class is not intended to teach people how to swear. Whoa there, Miss Taylor. Let's not jump to conclusions. Why don't we get together tonight and go over some ideas to help these little buggers learn quicker? Are you serious, Mr. Murphy, or is this a come-on? Of course it's a come-on but a serious one. [ organ music playing ] [ music playing on ghetto blaster] I'll think about it! Hey! Hey! Turn that down, you toilet-dwelling ho-hum! Sweat. The more you sweat, the more you are acting. I will be teaching you techniques. The same secret acting techniques used by all the great stars, like Allen Zuker, Greg Fonda, and, of course, Danny Lipscomb. Now, remember, we are not a pipeline to the studios. But, and this is only a but, if I feel any of you show real promise, I will send an 8x10 glossy of you to an agent. Of course there would be an additional charge for that. Now, are there any questions? Uh, let's see, you, sir. Uh, what time is it? Uh, it's five minutes till 8:00 You, sir. Is that A.M. or P.M.? It's P.M. Were you in a move? And if so, what's the name? Uh, yes. As a matter of fact, I was in the movie "Night Patrol." I had a bit part in it, but it launched my career as well as that of Greg Fonda-- And Danny Lipscomb? Right. Right. Of course. Danny Lipscomb. Uh... you, sir. As an actor, do you have to memorize your lines? Yes, you do. Damn. Uh, yes, you, sir. Yes. If I star in a movie, should I quit my day job? No. By no means quit your day job. Sir? Do you have to use your tongue when you do a stage kiss? You have to use the balls of your feet up through your groin, your gut, your heart, your soul, your stomach, diaphragm, lips, teeth, tongue, trachea 110%. Sweat. Thank you. Uh, you. Do you have to take your clothes off? If you're lucky, that's all you have to do. Sir? What time is it? It is 8:00. - Is that still A.M.? - P.M.! [ bell rings ] What a trip, man! I never knew that, man! Acting is sweating, man. That's amazing, man. 985-3303. Area code 818. I can take everything in my whole life, man, and put it into my acting. You know, all the drugs, all the violence, all the women, man, and I can become a great actor. Man, I'm gonna be a star, Danny! I call you later, okay, baby. Mm-hmm. Adios. That smell. Excuse me. We're looking for Kathy Taylor. Immigration! We'd appreciate you calling us if any of these people show up to your classes, especially this Carlos Menuzo character. He's been giving us the slip now for almost two years. We think somehow he's getting state aid, medical, everything. What do you do with them when you catch them? Send them back to Taco Land. Maybe you should put out some poison meat. You know, if it was up to us, we'd shoot the bastards and mount their fucking heads! [ both laughing ] There's a wine-tasting class down this way, room 103. Lot of suspicious types. Hey, thanks, guy. We'll check it out. Ma'am. You called 'em, didn't you? Perhaps. [ bell rings ] [ organ music playing ] [ muffled groaning ] Well, well, well. Carlos Menuzo. Hey, what's that, man? Both: Hey! Stop! Immigration! Have you made contact yet? What's going on, huh? [ toilet flushes ] Katherine, on tape: You're not only rude, ill-behaved, ill-bred, ill-mannered, you're totally unappealing. Talk to us, Danny. Man on P.A.: Any qualified teacher report to automotive shop immediately. Can I help you? Did you see an alien come through here? An alien? Where did he come from? What does he want? Oh, my God! What a scientific find! Wow. What space creatures! Thank you. Oh! Welcome to our planet. Is it water that you people need? No, I'm not thirsty right now. What planet do you come from? Estapa. Oh, my Jesus! In the name of science, take me! Ravish me! Oh. Uh... I'd love to ravish you, but I don't have time right now. I'll come back, and I'll ravish you after finals, okay? Don't leave me like this! [ fabric tearing ] [ inaudible dialogue ] - Come here! - Get him! - Get over here! - Get him! [ clock tower chiming ] Jefferson High School is not a rehabilitation center! One of them busted into my class. He was wild-looking and savage-like, and he said he wanted to eat my flesh. Did he? No. At the last minute, he beamed himself up to his spaceship. Look, Hargrave, in Special Forces when something didn't work, we fixed it. And if we couldn't fix it, we eliminated it. Elimination's not a bad idea for these people. These people are filth. Filth I tell you! Some man wants to run for homecoming queen. Really? What's his name? What the hell is there left to say? Scum is scum! Murphy's right! Eliminate the bums! You make sure you tell them exactly what we talked about. I'm not interested in what you think. [ all talking ] [ pounds gavel] Order. [ pounds gavel ] Shut up! You people turn my stomach! I had a bowel movement this morning that has more substance than all of you put together. Now, this program will continue until the end of the semester! If at that time things continue to deteriorate-- - They will! - They will! Then we will eliminate... the program. May I say something? All: No! Katy! Are we still on for Friday night? Jesus. Does that mean yes? Miss Taylor! Yes, Mr. Kline. As an actor, I have to keep my finger on the pulse of the industry. Mr. Kline, I'm in a bit of a hurry. If you don't mind-- No. I just wanted to tell you I'm on your side. Oh. I have negotiated, at considerable effort and time, a deal with the local Hispanic cable station to do a one-hour special, and I want you to give me some select students to form a cast for a production I could direct. And if we get the media behind us, which we will, with my connections, I'm sure we could draw some support to help keep this night school alive. Hey, looking good, guys. Anderson, bend over and pick up the soap. [ laughs ] Hey, Bernstein, you're shaving your balls. Look good. Hey! Not so fast, big guy. You're new here, aren't you? - Coach! - What? Mrs. Grant: But we've got to do something. This whole thing's a nightmare. Listen, I asked you here because we've got to do something on our own. This thing has gotten out of hand. Coach, get over here. Get your mind off those buns. Now, listen, we've got to get Hargrave on our side. Exactly. Now, I personally don't want to see another Hindu or a Spic again. Absolutely. So, if the program... Was to fail miserably, then... The school's reputation would be... Dishonored. Exactly. Which means, Coach... Um... [ clears throat ] Which means they would have to cancel the free programs. Mrs. Grant: Right. And go back to the paying courses for those who can afford it. Mrs. Grant: Absolutely. Now, if we stick to this plan, we can get rid of this scum. - Absolutely. -And then? And then? Nothing. That's it. "Crime and Punishment." Read it tonight. Test tomorrow. [ all groan ] F. F. F. D. [ laughs ] F. F. [ laughs ] F. Hey. You didn't make any comments on this. Oh, I'm sorry. I must have missed yours. Is that better? But you didn't even read it. Don't need to. The results from your midterms are, um... How can I put it? They suck! Thank you, Mr. Brown. I would have phrased it a bit differently. There as bad as a dried-up old whore! I think we all got the point, Mr. Brown. Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, please try to do your best to achieve passing grades. Otherwise-- Oh! Otherwise, the academic-- Man: Bent over like a double-barreled shotgun. Otherwise, the academic programs will be cut. No Sex Education? Man on P.A.: All spearchuckers report to track field-- - [ groans] - No, wait. Are they really expecting those kind of grades from the students? Like I said, it's up to you to save this program. Me? Not you, all of you! Wait a minute. Wait a minute. I think I got something you should hear. I picked out the hottest little French restaurant for tomorrow night. Dress sexy. Make it happen for me, okay? [ chuckles ] Yes, of course. Things just got worse. How you doing, Warren? My wife's been telling me that, uh, you haven't been keeping an eye on her. We had a deal! You remember? I remember, Joey. Joey? [ fire alarm ringing ] Come on! Let's get out of here! You guys gotta help me. Um, did he actually threaten you? He tried to shoot me! Is that enough of a threat for you? Did you get it on tape? Yeah, I got it on tape. Listen to this. Katherine: ...ill-behaved, ill-bred and an asshole. Wrong tape. I'm sorry, pal, but you are completely on your own until you come up with some evidence. [ clock tower chiming ] [ yawning ] Where's Mrs. Grant? Good evening. All right. What are we doing here? - [ bell rings ] - Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. All right, whatever it is you're doing, keep doing it. I'll see you next Thursday night, 8:00. Friday at 9:00. Well! Hello, Miss Taylor! I'll have a replacement for you, Mrs. Grant, by Friday. You needn't return. What? You could have at least given them a chance and not humiliate them. Oh, come off it! For Christ's sake, Taylor! We're all doing our very best for the goddamn pinheads! Goodness, Mrs. Grant. Do you mean to say you actually associate integrity with your teaching? Huh? Forget it. You wouldn't understand. Good evening, Mrs. Grant. Why you little slut! Aah! No! Aarrgghh! You're a teacher! [ growls ] Come on. Let's get out of here, honey. Come on. I'm gonna ride you, baby! Hyah! [ urinating ] Got a light? Let me hold that for you. You got a little drip there, honey. Any of you seen Danny Warren around? Uhh! Hyah! Get in the toilet where you belong! Miss Taylor, is that you? All right! What a right arm! [ shouting ] Aah! [ shouting, indistinct ] Aah! [ shouting, cheering ] Katherine: That's it! Hyah! [ fabric tearing ] Hyah! Get up, you backstabber! Get up! Hyah! Whoa! [ laughs ] Stop it. Cut it out. [ laughs ] Lady, you're lucky I'm wearing my heels! Oh, yeah? Aah! Uhh! [ bell rings ] You can breaststroke. Very good, now. Okay, do the backstroke. Back. Back. Okay, stop. Stop. That's it for class today. I'll see you all next week. Okay. Bye. [ classical music playing ] [ music continues ] [ slurps ] [ slurps ] I'm sorry, Bill. [ chuckles ] Listen, Bill, can you help me out in getting the faculty to change their program? I knew this whole thing was a setup, but I thought you'd bring it up after your 19th shot of tequila. You know, like totally luded out, naked on my pool table. But, hey, you're so subtle. It was a bad setup, okay? You don't deserve it. But why can't you help these people? Surely you've got a heart. Let me tell you something. I'm giving a lot of thought to those genetically inferior theories. These people are deprived because they can't make it. Pure and simple. - You're insane. - Oh? Tell me one thing that those dirtballs can do that I can't do. Arts, science, business, even athletics. You want to back that up? - A wager? - Yes, a wager. Okay. Fine, fine. You call it. What'll it be? Jogging? Tennis? Fencing? Tennis. Tennis. Okay, tennis. What will we bet? I bet that if my students beat you in a single match of tennis then you help me wholeheartedly to sell that program to the board. Deal. And when you lose, you're mine. What? Why not? You seem so sure you're gonna win. Now, if you're not sure-- Okay. Okay. It's a bet. The first student that comes along. Present for you. Oh, no. Hey, what kind of place is this? You know homeboy had to pay for parking? You know these people? No-- Yes. Katherine, this is getting embarrassing. These gentlemen are students at the night school program. Oh, and worthy opponents, no doubt. [ laughs ] Maybe this will change your mind. Bill, on tape: Which means they would have to cancel the free programs. Mrs. Grant: Right. Bill: And go back to the paying courses for those who can afford it. Now, if we follow this plan, we can get rid of these scum. Well, it's getting a little late for me. I've got some papers to grade tomorrow. So if you'll excuse me-- Sit down. Hey, I don't have to take this abuse. What are you doing? [ Latin music playing ] Listen, we're gonna give you a little time to think of a solution to the problem you created here. And in the meantime, if you don't mind, I'm gonna dance with Katherine here. - Dance? - Dance. A-ha! Hey, hey! Hey, man, this is pretty good. Hey, what is this, huh? Snails. Eww! [ spits ] Listen, I apologize for Bill's behavior. He's a good teacher. He's just-- A bigot. No. An asshole. Well, kind of. [ both laugh ] Yeah, he's a asshole all right. [ laughs ] Hey, how come you're such an asshole, huh? I work at it. Oh. Hey, look, man I got a rehearsal tonight, man. I gotta get back to school, okay? Look, you take it easy. I'll talk to you later, all right? Hey. Hey, thanks, man. They match. All right. Hey, Danny. Hey, holmes. Hey, man, I gotta take off, man. I got a rehearsal, all right? I'll check with you later. Hey, you people keep partying, all right? Later on, holmes. [ both laugh ] Yeah! Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh. Katherine: Hey, Danny! I bet you didn't know I could dance, did you? [ high-pitched whine ] Hello. Hello. This is an antique my wife's very interested in buying. Thank you. Antique, you know, for my wife. That's a very beautiful hat you have. It really is. I'll be right back. I'm just going to take this into the men's room and put my feet up on it for a minute. I'm getting a little faint. Thank you. Mr. Rasseli? Yeah. Listen. You know a guy named Danny Warren? Yeah, what about him? Well, I think he's a cop. He's a what? He's a cop? What are you saying? And I also think he's sleeping with your wife. What?! [ mumbling ] I'm gonna kill him! You want to know where you can find him? You bet I do. He's a cop, you idiots! He's a goddamn cop! Goddamn! I'll kill him! Let's go! I hated him! I've always hated him! Let's go! I hated him at school! Kill him! I hated him since... Excuse me. Very lovely. Very lovely indeed. Lovely hat. - [ thud ] - Ow. It wasn't what I thought it was. [ Katherine laughs ] [ both laughing ] That was fun. Listen, Danny, I'm really sorry about what happened, and I'll take care of everything. I'll give all the students an "A", just get these handcuffs off me. I don't want you to give them an "A". I want you to give them the grades they deserve. Nothing more. Nothing less. - What? - Yeah. Okay, okay, I'll do it, just get these handcuffs off me. You know what? I think I left the key in my other jacket. We're going to have to go over to my place and get it. Together? No hard feelings. But-- What's wrong, Bill? Nothing. [ chatting ] Hey! Dartman! Your checked bounced! Get out of here, Leona. My ex-wife. Yeah, sure. I'll make it up to you later. How about a foursome? His people only swing with barnyard anim-- Only kidding. You know what, Bill? You're an asshole. Someday, you're gonna get your dick shot off. [ tires screech ] You move, I'm gonna blow your fucking head off! Don't move! I could have been shot, you shit! I though you said "Move." Get after him! Get after him! Bill: I said "Don't move!" Katherine: Aah! Who are those people? What do they want? He's an undercover cop planted at the night school! I am not! Is that true, Danny? [ tires screech ] Katherine: What are you doing?

[ tires screech ] Get him! He went over there! Get him! Get him! Before you kill me, just get one shot at him! Where is your friend? Friend? He's no friend of mine, that stupid homo! Hey, you asshole, we're homos! Do we look stupid to you? God, no! No. In fact, I think you guys look really bright. I mean, you look smart. You give Danny boy our message, or I'm gonna come back here and make you eat your leg. You understand? [ laughs ] You tell him we're after him! There's a good boy. Uhh! [ groans ] I just don't believe a word you say, okay? So do me a favor and don't talk to me. Just go out there and win the game. Murphy! My God! What happened to you, Murphy? Can you play? Play? I can't even unzip my fly thanks to you. But don't worry. I have a replacement coming. You can't do that, Murphy. One of Jefferson Hawthorne's very own. Katherine: Oh, my God. It's Todd Lewiston. He's All-State tennis champion. Danny: Yeah. I'll beat him anyway. Uh, can we move this along, Mr. Murphy? I'm late for class. Absolutely. Ready? - Yes. - No! Give me a hand. Uhh! What's the matter, Katherine? Getting cold feet? You're a rat, Murphy. Murphy: So I'm told. [ laughs ] Danny: Uhh! Sir? I'm really sorry I keep hitting you. But you keep getting in the way of my put-away shots. Uhh. You have a real unique game. It's original. Kinda reminds me of... nobody. Were you this good at baseball? Uhh! Yeah, Danny! Whoo! Come on, Danny! Give it to him, Danny! [ laughs ] Katherine: Danny! Oh, Danny! Danny! Oh, no! Danny! Danny! Oh! Are you okay? Oh, my God! Did you break anything? That was a dirty trick.

Oh, golly gee. That's really too bad. I'll see you after finals. Wait. What's that supposed to mean? Oh, nothing. Danny boy. Long time no see. Last night, somebody called in a disturbance. It sounded like you or one of your pals. Danny, at this rate, it's gonna take you until 1996 to pay back that bail money. Do you get my drift? You ain't busted nobody! Not one fucking arrest! You're jerking us around! Not here. Hey... we're going up to the school now, Danny, because we got word that Joey Rasseli himself is gonna be there. I even hear that he wants to kill you personally. I'm sorry, you can't do that. You just watch us. Sí, señora. Hermosa. I just got to go up to the gym and change. It'll take one second. Do it and do it fast. And make sure you don't jerk us off. [ chatting, indistinct ] You ever hear of this invention, man? It's called a toothbrush. [ yelling ] I'm gonna kill this son of a bitch! Bastard! Danny! Danny! Danny boy, you want to end up in the county jail? Is that it? Huh? Food fight! Hey, what's going on here? Because of time, we will be doing a condensed version of "Romeo and Juliet." Do you have your scripts? We will omit every other odd page, every tenth even page. The performance will be on exam night. No groans. It will be live. Ladies and gentlemen-- [ drops book ] Let's go to work. Mr. Kline, as you know, I have a day job Oh, good. Keep it. Yeah, I don't have time to memorize my script.

[ both laughing ] "Then we went back to her apartment "at 223 Rosemont Avenue, apartment 709. "I said to her, 'This is a nice place. "How much rent do you pay?' "She said, "350 a month.' "And as she answered, she undid her blouse. "She had a great rack. And I was, like, in love." Uh... "'Does that include everything?' I said. "She said, 'Everything but a man.' "At first I thought this babe's "a professional lady of the night. "But when she started to do the naked dance of love, "I knew right then and there that I was, in fact, in love."

You are all failing night school, just like they want you to. Don't you people care about anything? They have written you off. They have called you a bunch of idiots. They have told you you can't cut it. They have told you you are stupid. Are you stupid? What was that? All: No. Are we gonna pass those exams? All: No. What was that? All: Yes!

Kick butt! Kick butt! She didn't say the word "play." Up. Down. Up. Down. Do you speak English? Do you need an attorney? Do you realize you can go to jail? As most of you know, these are the kind of questions a judge will ask you prior to your conviction. [ splat ] Kick butt! Kick butt! What are you studying? Creative writin'. I'm trying to expand my ability to communicate. I can't work with this dame! She's got an accent! Oh, for God's sake! Kick butt! Kick butt! - Aah! - [ gasps ] Was it something I said? Kick butt!

At least give them the grades they deserve. Give it up. Promised me that you and the other teachers will give them the grades they deserve, and I'll keep my part of the bet. Can I count on that? Yes.
