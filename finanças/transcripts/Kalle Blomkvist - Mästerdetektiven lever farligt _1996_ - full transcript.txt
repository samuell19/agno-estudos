... floral, white ... ... dress. Big. Today blood will flow, and a thousand times a thousand souls ... ... will vanish into the night of death. - What did you say? - Nothing. - Well, that was probably what I heard. Eva-Lotta! Run along then. But don't forget dinner at five. - 'Bye! - 'Bye. Kalle, thinks Master Detective Blomkvist, ... ... picks up the weapon, points it at the criminal ... ... puts his finger on the trigger and says: Stay right where you are. You are beaten. - Kok-a-lol-lol-e! Kalle! You must be mad! - Lying there dreaming again? - Kalle Blomkvist! You'll get bedsores lying there all the time. - I don't lie here all the time! - No. One day two months ago he wasn't lying there at all. - Thieves and murderers could roam free. - That's right. They could get away with murder for a whole day in June! - Oh get lost! -We're going to! And you're coming too! If you think the killers can manage unsupervised. - That's doubtful. - You weren't quite so smug last summer when we caught those jewel thieves. Nobody was complaining about Master Detective Kalle Blomkvist then! - Oh we're not complaining, Kalle but even so, these things only happen once. - This little hole won't see any villians for ages. That won't happen again. To the leader of the White Rose. There is not in all of Sweden a pig as swinish as the leader of the White Rose.. He forced the leader of the Red Rose off the bridge. An act that cries out for bloody vengeance. See you at the mansion. Sixten - honourable leader of the Red Rose. What have they cooked up together now? - That's what we're going to find out. - We'll hide Stormumriken. Then the war between the Red and White Rose can begin. Come on! Oh! What a hurry you're in. - Hello there! - Hello young 'un. No new cases for the Master Detective? - We've told the criminals to have a day off. Kalle doesn't have time today. - We're going to cut off the Red Roses' ears! - You're so sweet. Maybe you ought to try to be a little more ladylike? - Sure, on Mondays. But now we have to run. - Don't go climbing on the bridge railings! - No, no, we promise! - Nobody walks as strangely as old Gren. - He's strange all over. - Yes, yes, the happy, innocent games of childhood. - I suppose you get strange when you live alone. - Dad doesn't like Gren. He says he's a loan shark. - A what? - He lends money. - That's nice of him. - No it isn't. It's like this. Imagine you need ten kronor. You have to have ten kronor. For sweets maybe. - Yes, I can feel a need for that. Then you go to Gren and you get to borrow ten kronor. - Yes, but that's good, isn't it? - Although you have to pay it back within a month, and then he wants twenty kronor. - Why would I do that? - It's called interest. He wants to be paid because he lends money. It's called interest. - But couldn't he be reasonable? - He wants to be paid for lending money. That's called interest. But it's illegal. - But why do people go to him, then? Couldn't the borrow from someone else? - Idiot, it's not just a krona for sweets. It might be thousands of kronor that no one else can lend them. - Business. Now forget Gren. We have more important things to think about. They'll never find it here. Are you ready? Danger! Danger perceived? Good, you know the signals. Now we take them! Down with the reds! They're not here. - Stupid joke. Can't see them anywhere. - Little rats! So easily fooled! - It can't be. - They're in the mansion! Upstairs. We will defend the top floor to the last drop of blood. There you will be locked in until you starve to death. - Advance if you dare! - Oh the slimy little wretches! - Scum of the earth! - Cowardly little rats! Come on. Spread out. Isn't this nice. - You won't get out of here alive! Open it! - Just knock when winter's coming. - By the way, what do you want for Christmas? - Your heads on a platter! - Stuffed with an apple like all pigs' heads! - Insolent to the last. Shout when you're hungry and we'll bring you some hay. - Somewhere in this house there's a rat who calls himself the leader of the White Rose. Spread out. Find him! Is there an attic here? A secret door. Get out here! - Where have you hidden Stormumriken? I've got hay fever. Can't breathe. I need a handkerchief. - Here. A dead prisoner is a useless prisoner. Nice... I wow-o-non-tot tot-e-lol-lol tot-hoh-e-mom a-non-yoy-tot-hoh-i-non-gog! - We're definitely going to squeeze out of you what all that means. Hold on! We'll be back to rescue you soon! - Long live the White Rose! - Lol-o-non-gog lol-i-vov-e tot-hoh-e wow-hoh-i-tot-e ror-o-sos-e! - I wonder where they're taking him. What are you doing? - I need a newspaper. - We don't have time to read. We have to get out. - That's why we need a newspaper. - You think the newspaper will tell you how to get out of locked rooms? - Why didn't I think of that. - Seems unnecessary to ruin that piece. It looks no nice. You're amazing! - Purely routine. THE WHITE ROSE HAS THE POWER TO PASS THROUGH WALLS Is Sixten at home? - He and the boys were here a moment ago. If you see him tell him we're eating soon. Anders' writing. Jonte. They must be holding him at Jonte's. - Well, yeah, what else would it mean? - That's highly likely, because that's what the note says. It'll soon be time for grub. ... one final opportunity to save yourself. Where is Stormumriken? Just go on asking. You'll never find Stormumriken. Last chance. Where is he? Be sure we'll get you to talk. - The interrogation has begun. - If only we could see what they're doing. - But we can. - How? - It seems you haven't studied forensics. It's easy. Let's ask the people opposite if we can track down some criminals. - Do you seriously think old Gren will let us into his flat to stake out the Red Rose? - Maybe not. I know. Let's climb up to his roof. - For someone who's never read about criminology you're not so stupid after all. Careful. I'm going to pay back the money. - Damn right you are. Seems he has a visitor. - Stick your head in and ask for a biscuit. Give me a week I'll pay back every IOU. - I have to have the money now. - You'll get your money! - Don't raise your voice like that! - Not a tea party, exactly. Bloodsucker. - They're having a big row about money. - Ugh. Business. - I wonder what an IOU is. We'll put him in the garage overnight. - Kalle and Eva-Lotta escaped immediately. - Don't think you're an escape artist. -We want to know about your language. -Say something. My name, for example. - I-dod-i-o-tot. - I-dod-i-o-tot. - That's exactly what you are. - You leave when I say so. Not a second earlier. Where have you hidden Stormumriken? No! Don't! Stop it! Don't! - Ticklish, eh? - I promise. I'll tell you. Well? In the barn. At the mansion. At the far end of ... - Where? Where. - What happened? Where's the torch? - I'll buy Jonte a new bulb. - They're going to regret this. - See you on Wednesday at the usual place. Bring the IOUs. I want to put an end this nghtmare! - Did you hurt yourself? - No. - Hurry up, the Reds are coming. - Look out! - What a fool! - After them! Where'd they go? There! After them! As easy to fool as babies. Haven't they ever been to an X-rated film and seen how it's done? - Trouble for Kalle though. Three red foxes chasing one poor little rabbit. - Swine! - Cut him off! Gotcha! - That's what you think! He must've jumped the fence. - He couldn't do that. He has to be here somewhere. Run! Oh ho ho, I've got you now, boys. - We were just— - We— - You were just what? In my garden? Well? - We were ... we got lost. - Next time I'll call the police! Well, at least it's going in the right direction. Hi, Fredrik. - All right, Kalle? I'm at death's door. - Caught you red-handed, you filthy swine! - Are you talking to me? - Dad? - What are you charging around for at this time of night? I just wanted to see if you were doing a home visit. - Well I'm done now, so we can go home together. - Dad! - Come on, my boy. And Fredrik. You won't be dying just yet. I can assure you of that. Good night. - Good night. Benke. He's in there with Fredrik. Hey. You should hear my stomach rumbling. Just like a lion pit. - Have you seen Kalle? - Yes, he was here a moment ago. He was obviously in a great hurry. He threw himself out the window. - You can swim, can't you? Or should I throw you a lifebelt? - You can throw us your own cork head! Anyone could float on that! - Nice and warm, isn't it? Have a good swim! The White Rose managed the first day of the war well. But we have to move Stormumriken. - Yeah ... Eva-Lotta? - Coming! There are too many places. - So where then? - The water tower'd be safe. - Yes! We'll move him tomorrow. - I have to help in the shop. - And I have to help in the shoemaker's. - I can do it. I'm on summer holidays. - Great, go ahead. - If you don't come down now, I'm sending Dad up after you! - Yes! See you tomorrow. Are you going to sleep away the hottest day of the summer? Are you coming to the square today? - No. I don't have time. - What are you up to? - I'm on a secret mission. Don't be late for lunch. I haven't missed a meal since I was baptised, have I? - Don't go too far. Looks like thunder. - I've never been afraid of lightning! Bye! Lot of people about today. - Excuse me, what time is it, please? - Quarter to two. You dropped a note. IOU What's the matter, my darling? - Old Mr Gren ... - What about him? - He's dead in the barn! - Dead? But sweetheart ... Dead? He's dead! They found him dead in the barn by the mansion. - How do you know? - Gren is dead! Shot. He was a real gangster, that Gren. It was the baker's sweet little girl Eva-Lotta who found him. She's completely out of her mind. Crying and crying. White man, 50-60 years. You're a coward, Kalle Blomkvist! Master detective? Hah! The most horrific crime takes place and you're standing around wrapping herring. I'll never make up fantasies about crime again or pretend I'm a detective. Never! - How can people ... do that to each other. - Yes, it's awful. - Everything's ruined. Nothing's like it was before. I can't ever play again. - Come on, old girl. It only feels like that now. It'll get better. - Anders and I used to tease Kalle about murderers. As if it was something funny. Anders and I teased him! Maybe that's why it happened. Maybe it was my fault— - No sweetheart, it isn't your fault. Here. Nave a sip. - I'm going to be different, Mom. I'll be ladylike, as Björk said. No more fighting. No more War of the Roses. I feel so old, Mum. So very old. I feel like I'm almost twelve. You have to read this book. Listen: As they approached the enemy, they cut off a piece of the mantle ... ... to show they had been there. We should have lived in those days when things like that happened! Has Eva-Lotta moved Stormumriken? - Will you shut up? - What's up with you? - Old Gren's lying dead in the barn. Murdered. Eva-Lotta found him. - On her way to pick up Stormumriken? I didnt know there'd be corpses everywhere. - Nobody could have known that. - She can handle it. Any other girl would faint, but Eva-Lotta can deal with it. Maybe she can give the police some clues. She may even have seen the killer. What are you doing? Closing the workshop. He can say what he likes. CLOSED due to MURDER! Hold on. This isn't a good idea. - Yes it is, it's a great idea. They need you there. Who caught the jewel thieves? Kalle Blomkvist. - That was then. We should let the police handle this. - They can't do without you. Come on, we can't waste a second! Kalle's here! - What do you want? - Let him come in and look around. - This isn't for you. Run along home. Be glad you're too young to understand what happened here. They'll probably get stuck soon. Promise you won't take the case until they beg on hands and knees. To think Stormumriken's still in there. - This is the first time he's been guarded by the police. - Come on. Poor Eva-Lotta. She's just lying there crying. Maybe we should do something to cheer her up. Give her a flower or something. We wanted to give this to Eva-Lotta. - She'll be so happy. I'll put it on the bedside table, so she sees it when she wakes up. End of the War of the Roses. This is Chief Inspector Strand from Stockholm. - Lisander. - Strand. Strand - Stockholm. Help yourselves to coffee and cakes. I'll see if she's ready. I can't see we'll get much out of the girl. Children can't make .... ... factual observations. - Eva-Lotta is rather down-to-earth. - We'll see. Glad you're in on it. She might be a little scared of me. - Why would I be scared? -Good morning, Lisa-Lotta. -Eva-Lotta. Good morning. - We'll just talk a little, then you can get back to playing with your dolls. - I stopped playing with dolls eight years ago. - I see. Is that so. I think it would be better if we could talk to Eva-Lotta on her own. Thanks. So. Let's start at the beginning. You were out at the murder scene— the barn—last Wednesday. What were you doing there? - I can't tell you that. - Eva-Lotta ... - I was on a secret mission! - Eva-Lotta, we're investigating a murder. It's vital you tell us everything you know. - I was supposed to pick up Stormumriken. - Stormumriken? Who's that? That's our mascot. At first he belonged to the Red Rose. We're fighting over him. Right now he's ours. The White Rose. We'd hidden him in the ba— - Are we talking about an animal? - Hes neither an animal nor a human being. He's simply Stormumriken. - Right, we've done with Stormumriken. Ok, well, didn't you see any people there? - I saw Gren. How do you know it was him? - You obviously don't come from round here. Anyone from here would recognize Gren. Isn't that so, Björk? - Gren is very well-known here in town. - I know that. Continue, Eva-Lotta. - The man came from the other direction. Then he followed Gren. - Have you any idea what time that was? - Half past one. Half past one ... How can you be sure of that? - I asked the killer quarter of an hour later. - Asked the killer? Can you really determine who murdered Uncle Gren? Maybe you saw it happen? If I see two people go into a barn and one of them ends up murdered ... then I guess that the one who comes out alive is the killer. What happened next? I ran into him on the path. I asked him the time. He said it was quarter to two. - What was he wearing? - Green suit ... dark ... smart ... ... A wristwatch ... and a tattoo on his hand. - And his face? - He was wearing a hat. So I didn't see much. I was angry and scared. He dropped an IOU. -What are you saying? What did he drop? - An IOU. Don't you know what it is? Only a little piece of paper. But people argue about them a lot. - Did you pick it up? - Ye-es ... Good, what did you do with it? I can't remember. - Hold on. Let me explain. An IOU is a piece of paper you write your name on when you borrow money. So the murderer's name must have been on that piece of paper. Are you sure you can't remember what you did with it? No. No, it was never going to be that easy. Had you seen this man before? - Kind of... his trousers. - Where were his trousers hanging? - I could see them under a curtain. - Whose curtain? - Gren's, of course. - So where were you? - On a ladder outside. - Kalle and I were going up to the roof. - Hang on. Why were you going up to Gren's roof? - I ... don't think I can— - I get it, you were after another Stormumriken, were you? But, how do you know it was the killer? -They were arguing about money. The one with the trousers said: "See you on Wednesday. Usual place." And how many green trousers do you think are around on an ordinary Wednesday. - You've done very well, Eva-Lotta. You'e helped us more than you think. Now all we need is to find Kalle so he can confirm all you've told us. Do you know where we could find him? - Kalle Blomkvist is right here! Björk? Can you help us with something? - Maybe, what is it you want? - Fetch Stormumriken. He's in the barn. - yes, with pleasure. We're a little curious about that figure. 11-year-old girl witness to murder. Police looking for IOU at murder scene. Sweet little Eva-Lotta Lisander is playing today at home on Tvärgatan. Where the smell from her father's bakery helps her forget the horrible experience. How could you print something like that? - Yes, I really worked on the text. - How could you print her name? You've even put in her address! The murderer can read this too. A man who's killed once can do it again! Why didn't you print her telephone number as well. So he can ring for an appointment! Friendly little Eva-Lotta has already forgotten the terrible event. Today, she's playing happily among the flowers in her parents' garden. They can get away with anything when they print it in the paper! - It's good, because people send sweets. - Hello, children. I expected him to look a little more impressive. It's the inner strengths that count, Björk. Bye. - Maybe that's his first police escort. We need to put him somewhere more exciting. - Hasn't he had enough excitement? - At one of the Reds' houses! - We're just going to hand him over? - No! They'll be allowed to have him without knowing it. - Great! At Sixten's place. - They'll go crazy when we tell them. - Good one, Kalle! - Somewhere in Sixten's room. It's boring when Eva-Lotta's being ladylike. - What did we do before the War of the Roses? Eva-Lotta isn't refusing to carry a weapon. The War of the Roses can start again. - Yes! Do you want some buns? - Definitely! - Can't we sit in your room? - Have you got sunstroke? - You've got a good view from your room, haven't you? - The best in town. - Without the trees you'd be able to see the water tower. - See the water tower? Of course I can. - No you can't. The trees are in the way. - Don't believe me? Come and have a look. Hi, Beppo. Just a few idiots who want to look at the water tower. - Let's go for a swim! - Hello, children. Mmm, and what might such a little smasher be called? - Anders. - Anders ... What was that? - Aunt Ada. She's a little man crazy. She's from Stockholm. There, you see? - You can see the whole tower! Imagine! Not many people can do that. - Only the leader of the Red Rose. - But you must have cut down a tree. - No, I've always been able to see the water tower. - Not when I was here last. - Stop it now, the water tower's always been there, from when I was born. I think we've seen all we wanted. - Wow-hoh-e-ror-e? - Tot-hoh-e gog-lol-o-bob-e. - Gog-o-o-dod. Thanks for having us. Why don't you put some oil on that? - Why don't you go home and pull the blanket over your head? All of Sweden's little pet. And it's all for you! - Stop teasing and help me to carry this. When the full moon shines at midnight, Stormumriken goes to his new resting place. And I'm the man to do it. - What if Sixten wakes up? - I'll say I've come to sing him a lullaby. - I'm so stuffed. _me too, but that's good ... ... 'cause we've got boiled cod for dinner. - Everybody says eating fish makes you intelligent. - How much fish do you have to eat to be intelligent? - Depends where you're starting from. One small whale fish a week is probably about right for you. - I don't want any more chocolate. - I've eaten too much. - The day may come, when we're forced to mix the chocolate with bark. Save it until there's a famine. Revered Stormumrik, hold your mighty hand over this mission. Calm down, it's only me. Quiet, Beppo. Have some chocolate. Good boy. There. What are you barking at, Beppo? Is anyone there? You'll have to wait a bit. There they are. Here's some treats for you. Come on then. Beppo. Make an effort... Thank you, Sixten, my friend. A piece of the enemy's mantle ... A thief! A burglar! Hello! A burglar! You've been dreaming, Ada. -It was a burglar. I swear! - Nothing's missing. We have searched the whole house. - Beppo would bark if anyone was here. - You've been dreaming, Ada. Lie down now. - Nothing will persuade me there was no one here. Nothing! You will get your bed back. I'll be leaving soon. Oh my God ... What's this? Yes... Obviously men have done great things for me before. But no one's ever broken in to get a lock of my hair before! Maybe I'll stay on. Won't he ever come. - Maybe he's been captured again. You look really miserable. - I'm a victim of boiled cod. I've always said I can't eat cod. This is the proof. I've been throwing up all night. - So Stormumriken's still in the box? - Hardly! I always fulfill my assignments. Stormumriken is lodged in Sixten's globe. Maybe it wasn't just the cod, but nerves as well. I was in the house of horrors. - You couldn't have known Aunt Ada was sleeping in Sixten's room. - No. -But if he hadn't eaten the chocolate, I'd have been lost. - No wonder you're a little fragile. Stormumriken in Sixten's globe. That's almost too good. - You've moved Stormumriken! - You have to give us a clue! - Search the interior of the earth! - Use your sweet little brains now. If the Red Leader goes home and searches the interior of the earth ... ... everything will become clear. Have you found anything in the earth's interior? - What's happened? - I don't know, but the vet thinks he's eaten rat poison from the slaughterhouse. - Will he make it? -Yes. The vet thinks so. It's odd. He was fine at eleven last night. - Half past eleven. - Half past eleven then. How do you know that? - I can sense these things. Poor Beppo. - They shouldn't be allowed to put out rat poison. Dogs can actually die from that. - The slaughterhouse should know that dogs come sniffing around for meat. - Anders, did you give Beppo some of your chocolate? - Yes. -Did you eat any yourself? - No. At least, I licked my fingers. It was so messy in my pocket. What are you doing? - A purely routine examination! See you later. - Where's the fire? - Quick! The chocolate had arsenic in it! - What are you talking about? - Arsenic in the chocolate! - Are you completely sure? - Yes I'm sure. Come on! I'm the one who poisoned Beppo. If he dies I can never look Sixten in the face again. - Beppo's fine. You heard what the vet said. - Better him than you or Eva-Lotta. - Or you. One thing's for sure. You have to take on the case, Kalle. Otherwise there'll just be chaos. A week now, and no sign of a solution. We only have one description of the killer. We've scoured the entire area for the IOU. We have to talk to Björk! It's very important! It's really important! We have to talk to him! - He's in a meeting— - Get him! We have to see him! - This is vital! We have to see him! - He doesn't have time— - No. I'll handle this. - About the case. Kalle's taking over now. - No I'm not! - I told you this is none of your business, so go home. - Go home! Fine! Go home and let the killer poison the entire town with arsenic? We're doing a forensic examination. Is there nothing left of the other half? - Mum washed my trousers yesterday. - Mothers and their washing mania! - And the envelope the bar came in? - Eva-Lotta threw it away. She's very good at scattering important papers around. - Stormumriken. There may be traces on him. You put him in your pocket. - I think it's high time I met this Stormumriken. The things kids come up with! Bye! - This demands revenge. Police looking for IOU at the murder scene Imagine almost killing a poor innocent dog. That's insane. He never did any harm. - Poor Beppo. - The secret box. It's gone. If you want to know where your little box has gone ... Standing there with dull faces. Gone is your secret box. You who think you are smart, in a house there is a map. If you want to know more, go to the mansion and look. Oh, White Louse, search for a house. I'm never going there again! We have to. We can't let them have all our documents. - The inspector said we should play to help us forget what happened. Didn't he? - Come on then. - Okay. Might as well get it over with. I'd almost forgotten how nice it is here. Here it is! - They've hidden it in the barn, at the murder scene. The Reds aren't very resourceful. - We'll have to go there and look. - I'd rather die. Five minutes. Okay. As long as you come back for me soon. One and two and turn and move ... One and two and turn and move ... I didn't mean to scare you. - No problem. - I thought I saw someone I knew in here. - No, I'm the only one here. - Haven't we met before today? - I don't remember. - What might this young lady's name be? - Eva-Lotta Lisander. - So you're out here by yourself? - No, Kalle and Anders are here too. - I see. So you play here? - No, we're looking for something. - What's that? - An important document. - A document? - Yes. We've finally found it. - Where is it? - Kalle and Anders have it. Eva-Lotta! - Here they are. - Hurry up! The others are on their way. - Hello boys. You shouldn't leave a young lady alone like this. Come in. I want to talk to you. I have a plan that could earn you some money. Yes. Quite a lot, actually. ♪ Now it's summer, here comes the sun. ♪ Mom-u-ror-dod-e-ror-e-ror. Hey, where are you going? - I can answer a call of nature, can't I? - All right. But be quick! Where are you going? - Nowhere. Ready to earn some cash? - What time is it? - It's half past four. - Oh, it's getting late. I should go home. - We'll probably have to make money another day. - You're not in such a hurry, are you? Give me the document. Quick! - We don't have it here. - Where is it? - Up there, on the top floor. - This might help you speed up. Get a move on! Gog-o-sos-lol-o-wow-lol-yoy Pop-o-lol-i-coc-e o-non tot-hoh-e wow-a-yoy - Enough with that nonsense talk. Well? Where's the document? - In there. Don't think you can fool me. I know what you're up to. Give me the document. Otherwise I'll use this. Hurry up. Hurry up! Stand still. - Ror-u-non wow-hoh-e-non I sos-non-e-e-zoz-e - Stop your stupid kid nonsense! What's this? Some bloody map? - What's this supposed to be?! Kalle! Open it! Open it! We have to get the gun! Get your hands up! Put them on the roof. When I saw his hand, I realised he was the murderer. I never thought I could be so scared! - And in spite of that you kept on singing. - You deserve a medal. - And I said I'd recognise him out of a thousand! - Oh that's not so strange. And you should get a medal for "call of nature". - We saw you crawling in the bushes. Quick, get the police. The murderer's in there. It's true! I thought you were joking when you came there hissing about the murderer. - I've never seen you run so fast! - A record. I timed it. It's not every day that puncturing tyres is a good deed. Just imagine! he finally gave up. -Yes, but he hasn't confessed. - But everyone knows it's him. - That doesn't help. He denies it and the murder weapon is gone. There is no proof. No... they've looked in the barn several times. But I've had this in my pocket all along. That'swhat I've always said: IOUs are so ridiculous. - Are you off your head? We'll end up in a madhouse if you keep throwing documents around like that. It's going to Björk right now. Yes! This is exactly what we need. Now we've got him. Well done, kids. - To think you solved this case as well. One other thing, Björk. We'd like to have Stormumriken back. if you're finished with him, of course. - He's not here any more. - Where is he? Seek high above the earth. Let the birds of heaven show you the way. "And you will find Stormumriken." If you weren't so old, you could be part of the War of the Roses. - No, it's probably too dangerous for me. The calm and secure life in the police suits me. - You have to dare to live dangerously sometimes. - Well, Björk, the War of the Roses continues. - It probably always will.
