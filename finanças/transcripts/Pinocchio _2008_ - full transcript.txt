♪♪ (rooster crowing) Mister Collodi. (snoring) What are you doing here? (snoring) Mister Collodi. Oh, oh... what is it? You've fallen asleep here. You haven't gone to bed at all. Oh, my. The last thing I remember was that I was writing, and then... Maybe you should rest. If you like, I can draw you a bath. No, no, no, no. No, no bath, no, no no. Just bring me some coffee. Lots of coffee. Make it very strong, Elisa, please. As you wish. Ay-yi-yi-yi... Did you at least write something good... after so much effort? Coffee, coffee, coffee, coffee. Did you save your puppet? Lots of coffee, Elisa, please, and make it very strong. Very strong. Did I already tell you that? Yes. Oh. Thank you very much. Collodi: The puppet boy still hoped for some good soul to come to his rescue, but no one appeared. Not a firefly, not the Fairy, nor his dear papa... It's just as well I don't believe in assassins. They were all invented by fathers to frighten boys who want to go out at night. They don't exist. Collodi: As he cowered behind a tree, he could hear the assassins' footsteps draw closer and could feel their hot breath on his bare neck. Got you. My poor Pinocchio. You see what happens when you don't listen to magical fireflies? Come. Collodi: But while the Fairy worked her magic to return Pinocchio to the land of the living, Geppetto was convinced his beloved son was on his way to the land of the Americas. My dear Pinocchio. I will come for you. Even if I have to swim all the way to America. Even if I have to build a bridge across the sea. man: Hey, Luciano! Bring the oars down for the boat now. Why not? (laughing) That's it. (knocking on wood) (birds chirping) (coughing) Assassins and spelling books. Breathing fire. Trying to kill me, take my gold! Chop off my nose! Good morning, Pinocchio. Fairy! Thank you, you saved me! You've no idea what was about to happen to me. And-- and-- and everything that happened before, and I... Uh... I don't feel too well. I'm as hot as a stove. You have a fever. The doctors are here. Shall I show them in? Yes, Snailetta. I won't be a minute. Is she all right? Her? She's fine. She used to be a snail, before I turned her into a maid. Ahh. She's slow, but she's reliable. Once, I tried using a crab, but it was a disaster. Because it could only walk sideways? Mmm, no. Because it kept on stealing the cutlery. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Right. And now... Which is the sick one? Huh, call yourself a doctor? Isn't it obvious? Pinocchio: (coughing) Not her! I'm the sick one! What? I have a fever. Ohh! That's impossible! He is the one in bed... (all talking at once) Ahem. My dear colleagues. Merely by observing from a safe distance, without even laying a finger on him, I conclude that the patient... has a fever. Fever? Fever? But I just told you that! Shh! Shh! Shh! Right, then. Let's get to work. (grunting and growling) I got him! I got him! Let go! Stop wriggling, you damned little devil! My... He's an ugly one! Get off, you fool! (hissing) Where is he? Pinocchio? I got his foot! I got his foot! No, it's my foot. Keep looking. He must be here somewhere. Keep looking! Well, maybe he disappeared in a puff of smoke. Don't be ridiculous. Me, ridiculous? Interesting. Say "ahh"... Ahh! Very interesting. Fairy? Dear colleagues. This is a very serious case. Oh, yes. (gasping) His heart is not beating! Esteemed colleague, I do not wish to contradict you, but the heart, and it is a well-known fact, is on the right side. Really? Since when? In any case, there is no heartbeat on the right either. Therefore, this boy is dead. Is dead? He's dead. No, I'm not! I'm alive. It's just... my heart is still made of wood. My dear patient. We have studied medicine. You have not studied, so you have no right to express your opinion. Therefore, the chapter with your comments will be deleted from the final version. I prescribe a very bitter-tasting medicine. Gentlemen, our work here is done. Good-bye, gentlemen. I'll call the maid to show you out. all: No! By the time she gets here, it'll be dark. You'll receive my bill in the post. Oh, and mine. And mine. Good-bye, doctors. Good-bye. What's he doing with that old thing? It's not even fit for firewood. I reckon he's got a screw loose. He's crazy! Morning. Morning. Morning. Master Geppetto? Miss Laura... What are you doing here? Have you found Pinocchio? Well, yes, I know exactly where he is. Thank goodness for that. So, where is he? He's sailing to America. What? How does he...? Oh, never mind. I never met a boy quite like your son. You don't know the half of it. He'll be home soon. I'm going to bring him back in this boat. But Geppetto, this is crazy. Even if you manage to get this thing to float, there is an entire ocean to cross... and there is a huge shark, as big as a whale in these waters. But I'll get there all the same. I just don't see how you can possibly make it. Then you must learn to look beyond what you can see. Don't try to go all mystical on me, Master Geppetto. You're not some old man of the sea. You're a carpenter. Why must you always pass judgment on what you can see? These hands will turn this wood into a boat, a schooner. The finest ship in the world. Hmm. In life, you must do what your heart tells you to. Hmm? What's in it? Lots of good things to make you well. What does it say? I can't read. It says... Worm sneeze. I'm not taking that! All right then. We can make it taste sweeter with some sugar. I want the sugar first. You have to promise to take the medicine. Yes. All right. And now, the medicine. Come on. No chance! But you promised. Did you hear what the doctor said? If you don't take the medicine, you're going to die. I don't care. I'd rather die than swallow that stuff. In that case, I have to show you something. (horse whinnying) Who are they? What do they want? They've come for you. They've come to take you away, because you won't take your medicine. Will I ever see you or my papa again? No. Never again. I may be naughty, but I'm not stupid! Wait, Pinocchio! One spoonful is enough. Hmm. (horse whinnying) That wasn't so bad. (general conversations) You're crazy. Come on, Master Cherry. If anyone can do this... I can. I'm still the best carpenter I know. Still the best? (laughing) Certainly the craziest. You know, I'm helping you, so what does that make me? My very dear friend. No, no, no... Aahh! No, no. No, don't-- don't get all mushy on me. When I look at you, I no longer see an unbearable neighbor, a so-called carpenter with a penchant for inlaid spoons. I see only a father who's trying to find his son. Ah, no, no, no, no, no! No, no, don't... Oh, no, here, give... Give me this. You don't know what to do with it, I'll... I'll show you how to use this. Stop looking at me as though I'm your friend. Am I allowed to say thank you? Well, if you don't start weeping. I bet ten to one, that wreck sinks as soon as it hits the water. Only ten to one? Look at that thing. Even if it floats, I'll bet the shark will eat it. And the shark will spit it straight out again. Shark? What shark? Relax. They're only joking. That shark's no laughing matter. It took your hand? Not just my hand. My whole boat. Swallowed the lot, masts and all, in one gulp. Big shark then. Terrible shark. Clearly. No, no, that's what they call it: The Terrible Shark. Teeth as big as tombstones! Eyes as black as the devil. That's enough! Some of us have got work to do. We haven't got time to stand around listening to your tall tales. Now clear off! He thinks he's going to sail to America in that. He's mad. He's shark food. Master Cherry. Are you all right? I think you should build a bigger boat. Now, are you sure you're feeling better? Completely. As I say, I'm fifty percent. You really need to get back to school now. I need to get back home first. Do you still have the gold? Do you know what to do with it? Run straight home and give it to my papa. I can't wait to see him. Pinocchio. It's cold. You need a scarf. I'll get it. Thank you. Good-bye, Pinocchio. Bye, Fairy. Thanks for everything. Oh, one more thing. Don't get into any more trouble. Or not only you will break your father's heart, you will break mine too. I have a wooden heart. If it breaks, my papa will carve me a new one. But who will carve a new one for your father and for myself? I've learnt my lesson. I promise I'll be good from now on. I'll be watching you. Get lost! Go on, go play with the sharks. Get off! woman: Giuseppe, Mario, come here! Get off! Shouldn't you be in school? He's lazy, lying down. Huh? Come along, children! man: That carpenter's boat, he's made a good job of it. So what? He's not a sailor. He's not building a boat. He's building his own coffin. He is trying to sell his shop to buy the wood. I heard he wants to sell everything. That's right. I bought a spoon. Come on, children! Back to school! Excuse me. Can you tell me which way it is to the next town? Leave me alone. I'm asleep and dreaming that I am a lonely child. It's you! Pino-- Pinocchio... Oh, dear friend. Pinocchio, where have you been? What happened to you? I escaped from assassins. You did? Travelling is a risky business these days. Especially for assassins. Forgive my curiosity, but how did a simple boy like you manage to outwit such clever assassins? A fairy rescued me. Poor boy, he's delirious. Hmm... We waited all night for you in the Field of Miracles. We were so worried. Yeah, we didn't get any shut-eye. We even postponed our departure. How could we leave without saying good-bye to our dear friend Pinocchio, hmm? And above all, without his dear money. Ow! What you do that for? Did I say "money"? I meant monkey. Pinocchio and his lovely golden monkey. Hmm? Well, I'm sorry you waited so long. But I've decided I don't need any miracles now. I have four gold coins to take home to my father. And I'll make them last. Absolutely right. You can do plenty with your four gold coins. Go along, run home and live happily ever after... for about six months. Four gold coins won't last forever. Have you seen the price of property in Florence these days? That's right. And once the gold's gone, it's back to work. But I don't like work. I do. I love work. I could watch it all day. I don't get it. But if you had 4,000 gold coins... you'd never have to work a day in your whole life. Now, wouldn't that make your papa proud? Excuse me. Is it true that you're building this boat to search for your son? Now, I know what you're going to say: that I'm crazy, and the minute the boat hits the water it's going to sink. Well, you may be saying it out of kindness, but I really don't want to hear. So, please, excuse me. I can see you from the window of my house. You haven't once stopped to eat. Oh! Thank you! That's so kind! I had a son too. I lost him. If it had helped, I wouldn't have built a boat. I'd have built a hundred boats. Thank you. Oh! Thank you. You're so kind. Thank you. Well... there. There. That ought to do it. Hurry, hurry! Give me the gold. (meows) My little boy. The honor is all yours. The hole seems a bit small. Well, you dig one then. (meowing) This is the Field of Miracles, remember? You need only a little soil to reap much fruit. I thought we were growing gold? Still, maybe we should dig deeper. If we wanted to work hard, we'd have gone to a normal field, hmm? Please? One... Two... Three... and... four! (laughing) There. All done. Oh, no, no, no, no, my little boy. Something is missing. But I didn't-- I didn't take it! It wasn't me! I wasn't even here! (meowing) Water! Ahh... We need water. We need water, water to make the tree grow. But there isn't a well. Oh, we don't use ordinary well-water in the Field of Miracles. We don't? No, we use only seawater. Are you sure? That doesn't sound right. Are you calling my brother a fool? If anyone's a fool here, it's me! Ow! Why do you keep hitting me? I'm sorry. I haven't been to school. I don't know as many things as you do. Oh, I was never one for school either. And I am about to teach you a lesson that you won't forget. Seawater. And now, run along. Not you, fool... Run along! (gulls cawing) Not bad. But you're going to need a lot more wood. How are you going to pay for it? I'll sell my workshop. You're ruining yourself. On the contrary, I'll be saving myself. Can you come to town with me? I need a friend. No! Someone with a better head for business than me. That's more like it. I have a few spoons left. They might bring ten. Only ten? But you... They're fantastic, they're beautiful, they're exquisite, they're magical. We might get you 24. (chuckling) You know... Sometimes I think it's a pity. What is? That money doesn't grow on trees. Come on. I can already hear all that gold falling like ripe lemons. I'm coming, golden coin tree! I'm going to make you rich, papa! Pinocchio! I can hear him! Well, he's half an ocean away. It must be the gulls. You're right. Come on. Let's go sell those wonderful, those glorious spoons of yours. Come on. (Pinocchio panting) (Cricket chirping) What are you doing here? Waiting for my book tree to grow. That's stupid. Books don't grow on trees. Ah... but gold does? Well, of course it-- I mean... Well, wh-when you plant a, uh, a gold coin, then... I'll show you! Ah! (chuckling) Nothing's happening. It has to take a little time. I wonder... Will it be, hmm, 24 carat gold or just carrots? Uh... A little longer. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah, a little longer. Mm-hmm. My gold! It's gone! Stolen! By your so-called friends! No. It... It-it can't be true. It's not true! The only way to make money is to work for it, with your hands or your brain! The Fairy told me to go straight home. Why didn't I listen? Maybe... it's not just your foolish heart that's still made of wood, but your head too! The Fairy. She'll know what to do. (chirping) She'll know what to do. (birds cawing) Fairy? Fairy, where are you? Watch out! You almost squashed me. Snailetta? You're a snail again. I'm looking for my Fairy. Well, she's not here. When will she be back? Never. The men in the black carriage took her away. No... She warned you, Pinocchio. All you had to do was go straight home. But you broke your promise, and you broke her heart. Papa. I want to go home. I'll be good. I promise I'll be good. I'll do as I'm told. Please! It's too late, Pinocchio. Fairy, come back please! Give me another chance. I won't mess up this time. Oh, papa, where are you? Help me, please! Somebody help me! How many more nights you gonna work? I'm... I'm sorry if the noise is keeping you awake, but I must finish my boat. We know. Tell us what to do. You all want to help me? all: Yes. Are these your friends? Yes. Thank you very much, thank you! You're welcome. Uh... If you could reinforce the gunwale. Yes? And, eh... You could caulk the hull, and make it watertight. Yes? Thank you, thank you. Papa. I found you. Oh, I'm home. Collodi: When Pinocchio awoke next morning from pleasant dreams of home, it was to harsh reality. He had lost his gold, and worse, broken his Fairy's heart. He had learned, beyond a doubt, that disobedient boys are far from happy, and he resolved to change his ways. So, with his wooden heart beating fast, he set off for home and Geppetto. (bell tolling) However, even the best intentions will be waylaid by an empty belly. Do you have some money? I'm hungry. I'll give you money, as long as you help me pull this basket up that hill. Do I look like a donkey? I've never pulled anything in my life! Suit yourself. But take my advice, boy. If you're really hungry, first swallow your pride. Excuse me, could you spare some change for a poor starving child? Sure. Just give me a hand with this mortar. Is it heavy? Very. Then it'll be hard work. No thanks. You won't get anywhere, unless you turn up your sleeves. I think I'll just turn up my nose instead. My leg! Help! Ahh! Caught you at last! I only wanted some cherries. I'm starving! Yeah, you're a thief! Come here! No! Let go of me! Didn't your father teach you it's wrong to steal? He tried, but I'm not a good learner! What are you going to do with me? Put you to work. What have you got there? Caught him sneaking about. This is our chicken thief. Chicken thief? I didn't steal any chickens! (kids clucking) Stop! Stop, stop! Stop that! So, what are you going to do with him? I'll put him in old Melampo's place. Good idea, dad. Put him in Melampo's place. Who is Melampo? Yes. (kids laughing) (chain rattling) Melampo's a dog? He was. The old brute died yesterday, so you can take his place. And you'll learn, that if you want something to eat, you have to work for it. My new watchdog. Go on, doggy, bark. Show us how good you are. I'll show you! I'll bite your ankles! Woof, woof! No, no, no, no. Save your energy for tonight, watchdog. You two, get inside! (rooster crowing) (sighs) If I couldn't read you like an open book, I'd almost feel sorry for you. Cricket! I've never been so glad to see you. Have you ever been glad to see me? See what a state I'm in? (chirping) If my poor father saw me like this he'd die of shame. Ah, poor Geppetto, poor Geppetto. You wouldn't listen to a word he said. You're right, Cricket. I should have listened to him, and to the poor Fairy, and to you too. Even though you're bo-- bo-- Well, never mind. So, what are you going to be now? A good or a bad boy? I want to go home and see my papa. No time to waste. You're going to need the Fairy to set you free from the chain. Fairy, Fairy! Come quickly! She can't hear you. Nonsense. She has magical ears. Fairy! She's not coming... ever again. I broke my promise and I broke her heart, she's dead. Fairies don't die, I'm sure. I read it somewhere. I read it somewhere... men: Oh! Oh! Oh! It floats! (all cheering) I'm a genius! A deck-splintering, mast-planning, boat-building genius! What a waste of time. All you need now is the sails! You do have sails, don't you? No. Oh... (Cricket snoring) (dog barking) Cricket! Wake up! Someone's coming! (singing) man: Melampo! Melampo! Psst, Melampo! Pinocchio: Woof! You sound strange. Have you got a cough? Woof! My name's not Melampo. It's Pinocchio. So, where is Melampo? He died. Now I'm the dog. Oh. Poor thing. He was such a good dog. Oh, but you'll be good too, won't you? Go on. Give him the bone. Oh, here. Have this for starters. And if you stay in your kennel like a good dog, we'll give you a nice plump hen, just like we used to with Melampo. Be quiet and stay put. (chickens clucking) Woof! Woof, woof, woof! Shh, be quiet! Woof, woof, woof, woof! What are you doing? Woof! Open the door, dog! Woof! Woof! We'll give you two hens! Woof! Three! Woof! All right, the whole coop! Woof, woof! Just leave us a couple of eggs! Woof, woof, woof, woof! Thieves! Thieves in the henhouse! I'm coming, boy! I'm coming! We'll give you two chickens! Woof! Come quickly! Woof! Woof, woof, woof! Well done, Pinocchio. Well done. Woof! Woof, woof! (waves rolling, gulls cawing) Master Geppetto? Oh, Laura. I mean, Miss... What are you doing here? You need some sails, for your handsome boat. Here. Oh, I don't know what to-- Thank you. Well, this is your trousseau. I can't possibly take this. Look, there's a space for another set of initials... my future husband, whoever he may be. But I have plenty of time to find love. Use these now, Geppetto, and find the son you love. Thank you. Another slice of bread and jam? I trusted that dog for years. But all along he was helping the thieves. A good dog is hard to find. Hmm, yes. Hmm, hmm. Lucky for you this young man was passing by. Yes, that's right, passing by. Such a good boy. I do my best. Your parents must be beside themselves with worry. It's just my papa. What's his name? Geppetto. He's a carpenter. Geppetto? Geppetto? Now, why do I know that name? Oh, yes, of course! He's the crazy old guy building the boat. Can't be my papa then. Why would he be building a boat? Because he's lost his son, and now he's trying to sail to the Americas to look for him. The boy has a really funny name. Pinocchio? both: Yes, that's it! Where is he? Where's my papa? I must find him before he leaves. Don't worry. I'll take you. But we'd better drop those thieves at the prison first. But that's in the opposite direction. I can't wait. I have to go now. Thank you for the breakfast. Oh... (kiss) Good-bye. You know what you would say if you were here? You'd tell me I was right. So, try not to worry too much. Between you and me, I-- I don't think you ought to say things like that, not in public. They already think you're mad, trying to cross the ocean in this thing. And what do you think? I think you need a flag. Yeah. Cricket: No, Pinocchio! What? I have to get there before he sets sail! Oh, no! Which way? Which way is it? There's no sign! Which way should we go? Maybe you should wait for the weather to improve. This is perfect sailing weather. The wind will fill my sails. I'll catch up to Pinocchio in no time at all. Come on, help me cast off. What about Laura and the fishermen, though? They're-- they're planning a grand sendoff. That's all very kind, but time is of the essence, and I must leave now. Come on. Help me to cast off. Come on. Let's review. Moss grows on the north side of the tree. Sunflowers turn towards the sun, which, as it is morning, is in the East. And we want to go... Uh... Which way do we want to go? (chirping) Oh, Fairy, only you can help me! Oh, this is hopeless. Hmm, that goes that way, and that-- oh... Look, Cricket! She's showing us the way! (cheering) Wait for me! Wait for me, Pinocchio! Papa! I'm here, papa! It's your Pinocchio! Papa! Papa, I'm here! Somebody get him back! We'll get him back for you, don't worry. Let go of me! Launch the boats! No, no, no, no. Pinocchio, Pinocchio. Stay calm, stay calm... Papa! (thunder rumbling) Papa! Come on, let's go, don't worry. Papa! You're cold, come on. Papa! Come on, Pinocchio. Let's go inside and wait for him, don't worry. Papa! Come on! Come on, Pinocchio! It's all right. Will my father be able to come home? Oh, he'll come back. Don't worry. (thunder crashing) (rain falling, dog barking) (thunder crashing) Papa. My poor papa. Where are you? Do you ever stop whining? Lampwick! (thunder crashing) Hello, kiddo. Hey, I'm not whining. I just want him back. Well, you better get used to it, because he's not coming back. Liar! I'm the only one telling you the truth. You've lost your dear papa, and now you're free to do as you please, just like me. Have you heard the big news? I don't care about your news. I'm not listening. All right then. What news? That I'm going away. I'm going to the best place in the world. The Land of Toys! You should come too. Me? No, I'm waiting here for... Oh, yeah, yeah, I know. Still, you'll been missing out. The holidays start on the first day of January... and end on the last day of December. It's fun from morning till night there. And you know what happens the next day? The fun starts all over again. Sounds amazing. So come with me. The carriage leaves tomorrow night. Just outside the village. All play and no work. All play and no work. No! Good-bye, Lampwick. (thunder crashing) Good-bye, Pinocchio. I will find my son! Pinocchio! (gulls cawing) (indistinct conversations) Did you rescue him? Where is he? No... no! You said everything would be all right. You lied to me! No, no, no, no, believe me, I didn't mean to. You knew he was dead! You knew it! No, no, Pinocchio! Pinocchio... Come back, my son. I'm not your son. I'm not anyone's son! Pinocchio! Pinocchio! Pinocchio! Pinocchio! Pinocchio! Where are you, boy? Come here, boy! Pinocchio! It's all right, lad! Pinocchio! Come on out, lad! Pinocchio! Pinocchio! He's not here. Pinocchio! Now we've lost him. He's not here, he must be down by the beach still. Try that way. (donkeys braying) Whoa! Whoa, there. Why are we stopping? Pinocchio! Lampwick! I told you I'd see you later. I think there's room for one more... eh? Pinocchio! Wait! Don't do it! Pinocchio! Collodi: And so, believing there was nothing left for him here, Pinocchio set off for the Land of Toys with Lampwick. You're making a big mistake. Oh! (kids cheering) You're here. Hurry up. Collodi: The Land of Toys, where playtime never ends, and bedtime never comes. What'd I tell you, kiddo? It-it's wonderful! It's better than that, it's... It's... It's a dream come true, come on. Collodi: Like all the new arrivals, Pinocchio and Lampwick were dazzled by the wonders on show. ♪♪ For you, which one? I want that one! Of course, young man. There you are. Collodi: It was carnival and carousels, clowns and cotton candy. All the things your parents disapprove of, and all at the same time. Pinocchio joined in a game of knock the block off the teacher, one of the more educational pursuits. Your attention, please! The most marvelous, fantastic pillow fight is about to begin! Ready... Go! (kids cheering) (fireworks exploding) What time do you reckon it is? Still time to have fun. Your attention, please... To tell you the truth, I've had enough of all this laughing and fun. What? Are you serious? Your attention, please. Your attention, please. To follow, in the communal bedroom, there will be a bed-jumping competition. And don't forget that every child has the right to become instantly bored with his new toys. They will be immediately replaced by even newer ones... Give me that. Get rid of it. Get a new one. I want my mama. I do enjoy the sound of children's laughter, don't you? Laugh, laugh. Go on laughing. Tomorrow, the fun will be ours. (laughing) Collodi: Even the most energetic boy can only take so much fun. Eventually Pinocchio, Lampwick and the rest succumbed to sleep, and to the curse of the Land of Toys. (rooster crowing) What are you doing? I've had enough of this place. I want to go home. Look at your ears! Your ears! No... That not-- that's not right. (kids braying) They're turning us into asses. Quickly, we have to get out of here, before it gets any worse. Look out, they've got ropes. Run, Pinocchio, run! Don't let them catch you! Leave me alone! We've got to get out of here. I don't like this! They hurt. They've got me! Lampwick! Oh, I'm scared! (donkeys braying) All play, no work, all play, no work. Playtime is over. man: Close them in, close them in. Pinocchio: What's happening, Lampwick? Who are these men? Hey! Don't pull so hard! Lampwick: Don't you get it? We're being sold with donkeys. They'll put us to work-- hard work. (background conversations) As long as there are lazy children, we'll be in business. Well, don't you think this whole Land of Toys thing is a bit, well, elaborate? I mean, couldn't we just kidnap the kids, turn them into donkeys and sell them, one, two, three? You have no imagination. (thunder crashing, rain falling) Collodi: So it was that Pinocchio the Donkey found himself all alone in the world, and about to do something on four legs that he had never achieved on two. He was going to work for a living... in the circus. ♪♪ (shouts) And now, ladies and gentlemen... You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll cheer for our new star. Presenting... a mule with cool! The donkey with esprit! The equine of the headline... Pinocchio! The only donkey in the world who knows his times tables! Pinocchio: Cricket? Ringleader: Pinocchio... Fairy! Two times one! Is two. This is awful. I must let the Fairy know what's happened. She'll know what to do. Two times two! Is four. I've had enough of this. Fairy, it's me, your Pinocchio. They've turned me into a donkey! Come back here, you beast! Come back here! Please magic me back. No need to be alarmed, ladies and gentlemen. Pinocchio is a donkey, by name and by nature. (laughter) And now you'll see what a great acrobat he is! (laughter) Pinocchio: I'm so tired. They've worked me so hard here. My Fairy, she looks so sad. What have I done? No, come back! Don't leave me! So, so tired. (crunching, audience gasps) (gasping) Pinocchio: Oh, it hurts! My leg, it hurts! Get up, you wretch! How dare you make me a laughingstock! Off, off, off! Jugglers, jugglers! Come, come. Come. Come, come, come. It's broken? You useless brute. You're only worth your skin now. Take him away. Collodi: A donkey with a broken leg was no use to the circus master. However, a donkey's skin has many uses. But before the donkey can be turned into a chair covering, or a fashionable coat, it must be prepared-- the first stage is to completely soak the skin. Fairy! Fairy! Please, do something! Can't you see what's happening? Go on, free him! No, no! Pinocchio! Whoa, Pinocchio! (cheering) I never doubted you, Fairy! I knew you'd come back to help me! Can't stop. I'm swimming to the Americas to find my papa. Not that way! This way! Pinocchio! Pinocchio! (groaning) ♪♪ (water dripping) (whale moaning) Let me out, you horrible, smelly creature! man: Who's there? Are you a fish or a friend? You're alone, so alone, you're even afraid of your own shadow. Papa? Papa! Pinocchio! Papa! You're not dead, after all. No, no. No, I'm fine. I nearly died, you know? Yes? So much has happened to me. I've even been in a circus! Let's get you dried off. Is this really you? I'm as real as you are. Oh, yes, you are, you're real. Well, almost. Let me listen. Yeah, you're still made of wood. At least the rest of me is real. Hmm. But you should have seen me earlier. I was a donkey. Don't be so hard on yourself. You haven't have the schooling of other children. Hmm? Listen, it's not much, but it's home. It's damp and it's dark and it smells of fish. Oh, that reminds me-- dinner. Now, to start, we have cold fish soup. And to follow, we have cold fish in a light fish sauce, accompanied by a trio of fish. And for pudding, we have tiramisu. Tiramisu, really? No, cold fish. (chuckling) It's not so bad. You'll soon get used to the smell. Oh, what was I saying? We have to get out of here, before you go completely mad. Nonsense. I'm completely sane. Here... have a pillow. Collodi: So, over a light meal of cold fish, Pinocchio told Geppetto all that had happened. He had come a long way since he was a wooden puppet. Do you remember the first question you ever asked me? I asked you what is life for. That's right. Hmm. I've had a lot of time down here to think about it. And I may not have the answer, but I've got an answer for you. The purpose of life is to love. Hmm? So, unless you have someone to love, like a wife... or a friend, or a child, hmm? Well, life is worthless. And you know who taught me that? You did. Me? But, how could I have taught you? I haven't even been to school yet. Well, you did. Pinocchio. What are you doing? It's dangerous-- get up! Oh. No, it's fine, as long as you don't sit on its teeth. They're prickly. Look how many stars there are, father. I've never seen so many. Look at those lights. The coast can't be too far. Let's jump in. I can do it, you know? No, you'll wake him. I think I already did. (whale moaning) Get down. Get down. No, we can still make it! Do as I told you, get down. You must do as I say. Now is the right time. Are you sure? Yes. Grab hold of that plank, it'll help you float. Go! What about you? Do as I say! Are you sure? Go! Go! (gulls cawing) Papa. We made it. Papa. We made it, papa. Papa? Wake up, papa. Papa... wake up! Papa! (indistinct conversations) Look, it's my father! I-- I think he's dying. Papa! (Geppetto wheezing) It's his heart. He needs to build up his strength, or he won't live. In my professional opinion, what this man needs is milk. One glass, every night before bed. I... I haven't any money for a glass of milk. I can't afford to pay. That's the best I can do. The rest is up to you, my dear boy. (mooing) I need some milk. Sure, how much milk do you want? I need one glass, every day, for the next month. That's going to cost you. But I haven't any money, and it's a matter of life and death. I'm sorry. I'm just a poor farmer. I can't give away my milk. But, uh, perhaps you could work for it. Doing what? Well... You could grind my wheat for me. That doesn't sound too hard. (grindstone rumbling) You're doing well. This should be donkey work, but mine is on his last legs. A donkey? Lampwick? Is that you? Lampwick: Pinocchio? Lampwick, my friend. Can you hear me? Your voice is so faint. Don't worry. It's all right now. You'll be all right. I'm sorry I led you astray. I'm sorry I didn't stay with you. Perhaps if I had a father like you... No. Don't say anything. It wasn't your fault. You don't have to say you're sorry for anything. Good-bye... No, wait. Don't die. Lampwick, wait. Let's go back. Let's behave like good boys. I'm so sorry, Lampwick. I'm so very sorry. Collodi: From that day on, for more than a month, Pinocchio got up every morning just as dawn was breaking, and went to the farm to work. Every day he was given a glass of milk for his poor old father. But however much Geppetto drank, it didn't seem to help. Here, papa. Drink this. He's scalding hot! Fairy! Please, help me! Fairy! He's the kindest man in the world! He really loves me! He doesn't deserve to die. What's all the noise? It's his heart. It's so weak. He's going to die, isn't he? Comes to us all, in the end. But this isn't the end. And if you could make him well again, what would you give in return? I don't understand. I'd give anything, everything! Would you give him your own heart? Yes! Only it's made of wood. (laughing) A wooden boy... And I'd be wooden forever if it meant my papa would live. You would, would you? But... you're dead. I was. What's it like? It's a bit like Florence, but with more harps. Wait-- I don't understand. You brought me back. Papa? Pinocchio. You've given him the only thing in the world that could make him better. Milk? For heaven's sake. You've given him that wonderful thing called love. You know... What I'd really like is a cool glass of water. You're all right! I never felt better in my life. Your heart... It's beating so strongly. Yes, it is. But that's not my heart you can hear. It's yours. It is? Yes. It is! And it's not wooden anymore! It's a real heart! How about that? It's amazing what they can do these days, hmm? Thank you. Come on. Master Geppetto, you're back! How did it go in America? I never got to America. It's a long story, I'll tell you about it later. Good morning, officers. I'm not afraid of you anymore, as I haven't done anything wrong, and my papa's well again. We're really happy, Pinocchio. Really happy. Pinocchio! Pinocchio! Pinocchio, come here! Get us out of here! We are innocent. Oh, dear friend. Tell them how we, we helped you. Yes, you helped yourself to all my money! (both shouting) (cheering) Pinocchio. Oh! How are you? Geppetto! I lost my boat and your beautiful sails. I'm sorry. Oh, but I see you've found what, what you were looking for. Yes. Miss Laura, I've never been to school. But I have a great excuse. In fact, it's a whole story. Hmm. And I look forward to hearing it. In class, hmm? I'm going to call it "The Adventures of Pinocchio". What about me? Oh, don't worry, papa, you're in it too. Only I'm in it more than you. (laughing) Oh, bye-bye. Bye. Good-bye. Geppetto. Pinocchio. You're alive? One, two, three... What are you doing? I'm counting your limbs. So, the shark didn't get you after all? No, we escaped. Yeah. Funny little fellow you've got there. A real chip off the old block. Sorry. Shame you had to sell the place. I don't regret it. No, I mean it's a shame for me. I had to buy it back for you, here. I can't take that. Of course you can. You, you... You can pay me back in spoons. Master Cherry, you are wonderful. I know! No mushy stuff! (laughing) Oh, well... Just this once. Come on. Pinocchio? (bell tolling) Nearly at the end, Pinocchio. Tricky things, endings. Far easier to begin a journey, than end one. Here it comes. The last page. Are you ready? Does it have to end? All stories end. It's what makes them stories. Good-bye, Pinocchio. Good-bye, Cricket. (chuckling) The old place hasn't changed much. Hmm? I have. What are you thinking, son? That a wooden heart might beat forever, but a real heart loves for a lifetime. (laughing) Collodi: A wooden heart might beat forever, but a real heart loves a lifetime. Does it have a happy ending? Yes, I think so. But you'll find out when the book is published. Hmm. But something... tells me that this tale will have a life of its own. Don't you have to go out and collect your desk? A suspicious person might think you wanted me out of the way. Hat. Here. Thank you, Elisa. (indistinct conversation) Hey! Where are you going? You know you're not supposed to wander far, don't you, hmm? I know, Papa. But today is Sunday, and I'm looking for crickets. Hmm, all right. ♪♪
