[WATER DRIPPING] [BREATHING] MAN: No. [BREATHING CONTINUES] [BREATHING HEAVILY] [SCREAMING] [SCREAMING FADES] [PEOPLE CHATTERING] MAN: Hey! Where's Howard and the rest of the apprentices? We left them at the bottom to find their own way up! They got to learn sometime. lf you want to be a troubleshooter, you got to know the mine. ls it all clear down there? Yeah, we won't need these anymore, but l wouldn't go lighting any matches. Damn methane. lt's going to blow this place to shit one of these days. We ain't that lucky. Whoo, hey, come on, now. Knock it off. [MEN LAUGHING] Howard! Hey, Howard! Hey! Enjoy your walk up? Yeah, real joke. Why didn't you guys wait? Look, Landers, you got to get a lot of exercise if you're going to grapple with Gretchen. Oh, yeah? Well, l got a Valentine for her that she's never going to forget. Right to the heart, huh? lt's going to be a hot time on Saturday night! Yee-haw! [WHOOPING] Hey, Stavinski, you do anything else with that except throw it over your shoulder and burp it? Aw, get lost, Axel. Oh, bunch of clowns. Things haven't changed a bit. Same as always. Bet you wish you never came back. Especially now since Sarah's going out with Axel. No skin off my nose. l don't give a damn. Come on, last one into town gets the brew. Let's go. Okay. Let's go, guys! Whoo-ha! [ENGINE STARTS AND HORN HONKING] [TIRES SQUEALING] [AIR HORN HONKS] Quitting time! Casanova is here! HOLLIS: Yee-haw! Gretchen, it's me. Howard, stay away from me. Hi, babe. - How are you? - l'm fine. - Good to see you. - Nice to see you too. Hi, sweetie. You big brute, l missed you. [PEOPLE CLAMOURING AND KISSING] Anything l should know? No. Of course not. Gretchen, l want you to be my date for the dance. Will you? Dry up. Gretchen, you know what would look really good on you? - What? - Me. Suck it in and zip it up, will you? Gretchen, why fight it? Oof. Let the good times roll. All right! [AIR HORN HONKS] Hi, fellas. Mabel, this is the best thing that's happened to this town in years. Your decorating committee has done one hell of a job. Well, after all, the first Valentine's dance in 20 years has to be something special. Uh, yeah, well, uh, of course, you're right, Mabel, but l think we'd all be better off if you played down the fact that it's the first Valentine's dance in 20 years, if you know what l mean. Let's just concentrate on having a good time Saturday night and put all that other business to rest. My thoughts exactly, Mayor. [BOTH SCREAMING] Hi, guy. Oh, come on, you clowns! Help Miss Osborne pick those things up. [LAUGHTER] What the hell are you kids doing in here? You're supposed to be decorating the room, not each other. MAYOR: Where you going, son? Where l always go this time of day-- for another beer and a real good nose pick. Ooh! l'm sorry, TJ. l don't think he likes being back in the mine very much. MAYOR: Well, that's too bad. Nobody told him to go out to the West Coast. lt's not my fault he couldn't make it on his own. But now that he's back here, he's my son and he's working in the mine. You guys better put those things back where you found them, or l'll turn you both upside down. Especially you. This is my date, Chief. Chief, that meeting in Centerville is at 7:00. Maybe we should hit the road. Then let's go. l'll see you kids later. Bye, Mabel. - Keep up the good work. - See you, Chief. l might as well go too. All of this will have to be rewashed. l'm really sorry, Mabel. [SCOOFS] ANNOUNCER[ON RADIO]: This is station QPlD, 940 on your radio dial... Oh. Mayor! Mayor? Mayor, somebody left this for you. For me? Who was it? l don't know. lt was already inside when we got here. Maybe you got a secret admirer, huh? [LAUGHING] You in on this, Mabel? l'm afraid not, Mayor. Oh, no. No no. Don't look at me. l didn't have a thing to do with it. [LAUGHING] Oh, well, hell, l've been looking for an excuse to get off this miserable diet Mrs. Hanniger has me on. Thanks, Howard. MAYOR: lf there's one thing l like better than Christmas candy, it's Valentine's candy. Have some. Hey... who sent it? ''From the heart comes a warning filled with bloody good cheer-- remember what happened as the 14th draws near.'' [GASPS] lt can't be happening again. lt can't be happening again. [SIREN WAILING] lt's a bad time, this time of year. Bad things coming. My words, you hear. Beware the 14th... - ...if you value your life. HOWARD: Here we go again. How many times is he going to tell this story? PATTY: Oh, let him tell it. l love fairy tales. This ain't no fairy tale, little girl. lf you don't take it seriously, you're a fool. Ohh! HOLLIS: Hurt yourself? Axel, are you okay? Oh, no. Let me see. l know what l'm talking about. l'm telling you now, this town is a-cursed. Now it started 20 years ago. lt was the night of the Valentine's Day dance at the Union Hall-- the biggest event of the year. lt had been a tradition for over 100 years. Everybody was there, except for seven miners who were out at the Henniger Mine, five of them still down below. Two supervisors were waiting for the men to come up. Anxious to get to the party, they left before the men were safely out failing to check the methane gas levels in the tunnels down below. [EXPLOSION] The five men were buried alive as the town continued its party. [BOTH LAUGHING] For six weeks, we dug around the clock to try to save them. After we broke through, one man was found alive. l was the one who found him. [SCREAMING] Harry Warden spent the next year in the state mental hospital. Exactly one year later, on Valentine's Day, he came back to town. He killed the two supervisors who had left their posts the year before. Then he cut out their hearts and stuffed them into heart-shaped candy boxes. That night at the dance we found the boxes, blood dripping out the sides. lnside was a note-- a warning from Harry never to hold a Valentine's dance ever again. Every February 14, Harry comes back to town, his pickax stained with blood, waiting in the shadows of the Henniger Mine... just for someone to kill should they not heed his warning. lt could be you. l know what l'm saying. You forget about having a party at all on Saturday night, or you may not live to see daylight. [HOWARD BLOWS RASPBERRY AND LAUGHTER] Laugh now... but you'll be sorry you didn't listen to me. HOLLIS: Uh-oh. Come on, Hap, lighten up. HAPPY: lt's a stupid legend. SARAH: lt gives me the creeps. PATTY: Hi, you guys. Who ordered the Moosehead? l did, you gorgeous slab of female fleshiness. [JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING AND ALL SINGING] l hate that song. l mean, it's, like, uh-- hey, where you going? l just want to put on some music, okay? Be my guest. Excuse me. Excuse me. lt's your own fault. You know that, don't you, TJ? Never said it wasn't. Then why can't you just accept things the way they are? Maybe because l don't like the way things are. Excuse me. [SIREN WAILING] Yes, all right. Thank you. Thank you very much. l have to call in the morning. The administration office is closed at night. The nurse that's on duty doesn't know a thing. Well, she's got to know whether he's there or not. l just hope this is some kind of joke and the kids are just trying to scare the hell out of us. lf it is a joke, l want every one of those kids strung up, starting with that damn Howard Landers! Well, it's a human heart, all right. A young woman, about 30 years old. What the hell are you guys doing with a loose heart? Looks like a butcher ripped this thing out. What's going on over in Valentine Bluffs? You remember Harry Warden? God, of course l remember. Those were terrible murders. God, l thought they locked him up in Easftield 20 years ago. They did. Are you sure he's still there? We'll find out in the morning. l'm checking on it. Well, gentlemen, l'd say you have your answer. lt looks like Harry Warden's back in town. [CRICKETS CHIRPING] [HARRY WARDEN BREATHING] Well, now, l wonder who sent this? Jake? Ohh. ''Roses are red, violets are blue... ...one is dead, ...and so are you''? [SCREAMING] No! No! Get away! Get away! Get away! No! No! [CONTINUES SCREAMING] Get away! No! No! [GROANING] No! No! BOY: Hey, this is getting really good. HOWARD: Don't put your nose in it. [HOWARD LAUGHS] [WHIRRING] HOLLIS: Hey, this is what l really call junk food. How much longer, Hollis? l'm freezing. Hey, relax. This thing ain't no microwave. Hey, how about revving it up? Man, have l got the munchies. Yeah, me, too. A little protein patrol, hey, boys? HOLLIS: Don't go poking my meat. lt's hardly cooked. Don't go sticking your nose in the food. BOY: lt's his. He can do what he wants with it. ls that turkey, Hollis? l asked for roast beef. Turkey for the turkey. [HARMONICA PLAYING] TJ: Here. Come on, shove over. [COUGHING] Sure is cold tonight. Yeah. [BLOWS HARMONICA] [BLOWING AND PLAYNG] Well, l guess we got ourselves a problem, huh? Yeah. Yeah, l guess so. What are we going to do about it? Well, there ain't nothing to do about it. Sarah's going with me now and that's all there is to it. l ain't going to back off for you, TJ. Nobody asked you to go away, TJ. Come on, Axel, don't give me any of that horseshit. l mean, you're beginning to sound like my old man. Too bad, man. Look, you left. You left. You went away, and we didn't know where you were or-- or when the hell you were coming back. l ain't going to back off for you, TJ. You stay the hell away from Sarah. TJ: All right, all right. You want a fight, then you got it. Because you and l both know who Sarah wants. [MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO] [SIGHS] You were kind of hard on him, Teege. You can't exactly blame him. Sure, it's not his fault. lt's nobody's fault. l don't know what to do. You know, l really do like that son of a bitch. Hey, remember-- remember how we used to tear this place apart? Eh? Get drunk, race out to the bluffs? HOLLIS: That was great. l guess things change, huh? Nothing stays the same. [CAR HORN HONKS] CHIEF: W-A-R-D-E-N. Harry Warden. He was committed under court order approximately 20 years ago. Well, l'm afraid l have no records of a Harry Warden, past or present. CHIEF: But how can that be? He was committed there under court order. l'm sorry. l have no records on him. Look, in 20 years, any number of things could have happened. Now if this Harry Warden was committed, as you say, then he's simply no longer here. And if l have no records on him, l have to assume that he's transferred, he's released, or he's on the slab. One of three, take your pick. One out of three? Now look, Mrs. Raleigh, you're going to have to do a little bit better than that. Now l have to know what happened to this man and l have to know what happened to him now. Now have you checked everything? Everything... except the microfilms over in central file, and it will take several days to check that. Look, l need answers and l need them fast. l'll be waiting for your call. FEMALE ANNOUNCER[ON PA]: Dr. Peyton, 3-5-3. Jumping J-- they don't even know what the hell happened to him. Well, w-what do we need to know? lt's got to be Harry. Maybe we ought to cancel the dance. Just decide which one you really want. And now for the big moment-- will it be number one, or will it be number two? Patty, will you be serious? This is important. You can't have them both, you know. - l don't want them both. - Oh, no? No. [GIGGLES] Just what l thought. Oh, l don't know. TJ won't talk to me. He just sulks all day long. He ends up making me feel guilty, when he's the one who owes me the apology. And Axel is not behaving any better. Oh, Patty, l don't even want to go to the dance on Saturday night. Oh, but you got to go. lt'll be all right. Just stay with Hollis and me. Besides, you got to see the dress l got-- cut down to here, slit up to there. l may not get out alive. Mabel? Mabel, l got to talk to you. We got a problem concerning the dance. Mabel! Mabel, you back here? [SNIFFS] [WASHING MACHINE WHIRRING] Okay. Little John? l want you and Mike to check the wall. TJ, take care of the sump. TJ: You get a pump down there, or l ain't doing it. AXEL: You do it or you get your ass out of here for good. HANNIGER: l'll do it. l'll do it. What's bugging him today? Son of a bitch is after my ass because of Sarah. lf he keeps it up, l'm going to nail him. l said move it, Hanniger! Oh, yeah. Come on, man. [LIQUID SPILLING] Anytime, loser. MAN: Hey, that's it! Break it up, you two! TJ, you get your ass up top to crew 17. Go! There ain't going to be no fighting in my section, Palmer! Understand? What an awful smell. This is like it was 20 years ago. l can remember those murders just like it was yesterday. Jake, you got to get help from Granville. No, not yet. lf we call in Granville, we'll have police crawling all over this place and we'll have a hell of a panic on our hands. You just mention that Harry's back and this town won't be worth the powder to blow it to hell. Uh, just a minute. Just a minute, boys. Uh... l want you to bring the ambulance around back. Load her up from there. l don't want anybody in town seeing this. You remember-- Mabel Osborne died of a heart attack and that's all. You breathe one word of this to anybody and you'll have to answer to me. Wait a minute. What's this? Take her away. ''lt happened once, it happened twice. Cancel the dance or it'll happen thrice.'' Oh, well, th-th-that's it. The dance is canceled. Let's tear every poster, every banner, every decoration down and-- and out of sight. l don't want to see a single Valentine's heart anywhere. As long as this town is decorated to the hilt, Harry's going to keep on killing. And-- and get that damn Union Hall locked up. All right. All right, Mayor. No, l'm sorry. There's nothing l can do about it. Hey, what's going on? The mayor has canceled the dance and that's all there is to it. Well, in the light of Mabel's death, he had no choice. There'll be no parties, either. We owe her that much respect. Mabel would've wanted us to have the dance. l mean, she worked so hard on it. Yeah, you can't cancel it now. He's just looking for an excuse to cancel the dance. That's the way it is. They'll be no dance tomorrow night and no parties, either. Do you understand me? [WHIRRING] AXEL: Hanniger! You and me have something to settle! You bet we do. [COUGHING] HOLLIS: Howard, you got to chew it. You don't blow bubbles with it. l'll take care of myself. How'd you ever get to be so stupid? l'm going to shower. TJ, will you stop this? l don't want to go with you. Are you listening to me? Nope. [SEAGULLS CAWING] Remember this spot? Of course l remember this spot. Why didn't you write me, TJ? Why didn't you call? l wanted to, believe me, but l couldn't. l mean, l really fell on my ass out there. l made so many mistakes. But l learned something. Look... give me a chance. lf you still want me to go away, l will. But l have to tell you that l love you and l want you back. How was l supposed to know that, Jessie? l honestly didn't think you were ever coming back. You just left me here. Sarah, please. l'm sorry. l'm so damn sorry. [MUSIC PLAYING AND CROWD CLAMOURING] Have you seen Sarah? Ain't my turn to watch after her. [CRICKETS CHIRPING] [RUSTLING] [DOG BARKING] [WHISPERING] Damn it, Sarah, why do you do this to yourself? How am l going to tell Axel? [BREATHING HEAVILY] Sarah! Chief Newby. l'm sorry l startled you. lt's all right. ls something the matter? No, l'm-- l'm just making my nightly patrol. Right. Good night, Chief. Oh, good night, Sarah. Give me a beer, Hap. You hear about Mabel Osborne? She got it just the way l said. Heart attack, my ass. Well, if we aren't going to have a Valentine's dance, what are we going to do? Why don't we have a Valentine party? ALL: Yeah, a party! Where? Newby's got this whole town locked up, bright guy. How about my father's mine, huh? - TJ, are you crazy? Come on. PATTY: The mine! ln the mine? That'd be great. lt would. What a blast. HOLLIS: ln the mine? That's exactly what it would be. Oh, it'd be great! Come on, Hollis. We've got everything we need down there. We got, uh, let's see, we got a rec room. We got a pool table. Everything. Yeah, in the mine... where people get killed and eaten. Beware of Harry Warden. Whooo! Shut the fuck up. Beware of what you make fun of, you little asshole. - Who? - You. Forget about having a party at all tomorrow night or you'll be sorry. [SIGHS] Hey, lighten up, Hap. Piss on Harry Warden and that damn old legend. We're gonna have ourselves a party. Don't you go telling nobody. Don't say l didn't warn you. That settles it then. We're going to the mine and we're going to have ourselves a party. [ALL CHEERING] Assholes. [BRAKES SQUEAL] [DOOR CLOSES] [ENGINE REVVING] Damn kids. l'll show them. Piss on Harry Warden, will they? Well, l'll give them a scare they'll never forget. [DOOR CREAKING] [LAUGHS] [LAUGHING] Ah.

[MAN SPEAKING ON PHONE] [WOMAN CONTINUES SPEAKING ON PHONE] Mabel. Yooo! Does anybody want a beer? Eat you up. Mmm! Whoo! Hollis, check this out. [LAUGHING] You asshole! Hey, who busted the lock? - l got the keys right here. BOY: Howard did. CLOWN: Uh-oh. BOY: Howard. BOY 2: Harry Warden did it. And whoever parked the red Volkswagen out front, l want it parked out back with the others like l said. l don't want Newby snooping around here. Let me show you. [BALL RATTTLING] [ALL LAUGHING] - Hey, hold it. - Whoa. Hey, John, where you going? Sylvia's gonna get it tonight. [MUSIC CONTINUES] Talk to you in a minute, okay? [GIRL SCREAMING] So you're looking pretty good, baby face. What's the occasion? l figured it'll get Newby off my back. Besides, l want to get out of this town pretty quick. You know, l think he really likes you. [CHUCKLING] l've got the munchies. [MUSIC CONTINUES] Hot dogs. [WHISTLES] Here, Spot. Hey, what's going on? Who is that? [BREATHING HEAVILY] [MUFFLED SCREAMING] [BUBBLING] l, uh, l got a feeling about the mine, Ben. l'll-- l'll check back with you, all right? Make sure you call me on the radio if anything comes up. Will do. [DOGS GROWLING] Now what the hell is that? [GROWLING] Go on! [BARKING] Go on! Go on, get the hell out of here. [BARKING CONTINUES] [BARKING STOPS] "You didn't stop the party." Stop the party? What damn party? Stavinski, you couldn't clean that table with a broom. Hollis, you don't even know what pool means. Hey, guys, check this out. Check this out. Gretchen, this is for you. [BOY SNORTS AND PEOPLE EXCLAIM] Oh, wow. First time l try to snort Coke, man, and l almost drown. BOY: Next time, try harder.

[MUSIC STOPS] Back the fuck off, man. We were doing just fine until you decided to come crawling home. Well, in case you haven't noticed, things have changed around here. She don't want nothing to do with you. Do you mind? l have my own mouth, thank you. Then why don't you use it? Tell him. Tell me what? [BALL RATTLING] She wants to come back with me. Bullshit, man. Why don't you both just back off? You're acting like a couple of jerks. Oh, well, you just love it, don't you? That's it! [GROANS] You son of a bitch! [GRUNTING] GRETCHEN: Hollis, do something.

Okay, listen. l showed you how to do it with the right nostril, right? Now you take the straw and you put it up the neck, the left nostril, right? And you snort it.

[WOMEN GROAN] Oh, that was great, Hollis. - Let's do it again. - Howard usually walks. Oh, let's do it again, Hollis. Come on. [GROANS] Hey, where does that go? Oh, that leads to an abandoned part. We don't go down there anymore. - Oh, take us on a tour, Hollis. - Yeah. Yeah, let's show them around. All right. All right. Just because we're here. Come on. Keep those blankets wrapped around you. - You're gonna get chilly. - Okay, honey. lt's cold. All right, boys and girls, this is called a tipple. So that's a tipple. This is also called a tipple. - Hey, Howard, come on! - Coming! - Hey, Howard, come on! - l'm coming! l just heard something. Probably some rats. Rats! You never told me there were rats. This is the old engine room. Oh, uh-huh. Boy, what a nice view back here. Howard. Hey, Hollis. We'll meet you in 10 minutes over at the main shaft. HOLLIS: All right. No longer. We're going straight up. [CLATTERING] lt's pretty dark. How do you like my pad, huh? lt's okay. l can't believe you work here. Yep. [SCREAMING] - He's in there! - What is it? What's the matter?

TJ, it's Sylvia. Somebody's killed her. lt's Harry Warden. He's here! Everybody get the fuck out! Go! Go! Go! [PEOPLE SCREAMING] [COINS CLICKING] Come on, come on! Son of a bitch must have cut the phone lines. Okay, now listen. l want you to make sure that everybody gets out of here. And l want you to get the chief and tell him to get here and fast. Now go! Sarah, she's in the mine with the others. What? Her, Hollis and Patty. They took the railcars down there. They're in the mine right now. We gotta get them out. That's where that crazy guy probably is. Look, he'll kill them! l'm gonna get her out. Come on. Come on! [TIRES SCREECHING] Go! Go! Come on. lf anything happens to Sarah, it'll be your fault. You never should have let them go down there. Damn it, let's just worry about getting them out. l'll take the abandoned section, you take the level above. We'll meet in the main shaft by the elevator. Hope to God we get there before Harry does. Good luck. [ELEVATOR BUZZING] Where is he? l don't know. HOLLIS: Boo! [GIRLS GASP AND HOLLIS LAUGHS] Gotcha. Damn you, Hollis. Where the hell were you? l thought you were right behind me. You must have gone down the wrong tunnel. Oh, sure we did. You did that on purpose. Me? Come on. Okay. Watch your head. Watch your step as well. [WATER DRIPPING] This is the oldest part of the mine. Oh, God! These tunnels were built in the early 1800s. - Really? - Yeah, it's all abandoned now. Ooh. We haven't worked down here in years. Not since... Harry Warden. [HOWARD YELLS AND ALL SCREAM] [LAUGHING] Howard, what do you think you're trying to do, you jerk? Easy, l've got a hangover.
