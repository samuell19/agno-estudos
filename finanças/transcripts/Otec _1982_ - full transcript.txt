Furmulka, you have been with Formula, haven't you? Dodo! Have about the dampings? Did they endure? The most important thing is that you endured. But how long? Did he find you? Yes he did. You should come together with him. Come together…come together…but how? We'll figure out something. You were lucky. The chain is loosen. Guys, give me the tools. Don't you need the fork? And what would you use for loading? So you're gonna be reparing the motorcycle… …and we should work like slaves here? The division of labor. Or let's change our positions. Formerly, I wouldn't accept him as a groom neither. And he laughs at you nowadays. Boys, do something! Dodo, leave him alone! Stop it! Quiet please! Get back to your seats. Why are you fighting? Why? Mrs.teacher, please Kopčák said my father was an asshole! It's a lie! You said that Formula was an asshole. And isn't he an asshole? He will go to the jail anyway! Enough! Both of you write for 50 times…no… for 100 times: I will never fight at school. And your parents subscribe it. Sit down! Now we are gonna write the essay work! About what? My father. And I expect calligraphy writing! You write the essay work: My mother But you don't have a father, Formulka. What's wrong? Where are you running? Jožko! Come back! What? Why are you not at school? I feel so sad, mommy. Has anybody hurt you? Where are you running? Wait! He never did this… (before) Jožko! Welcome, my friend. Is the school pulled down? Or did they send you to voluntary work? You haven't seen me in case anybody looks for me. Jožko! Uncle, have you seen my boy? He's been running that direction… like crazy You can go Just go. There's no need to irritate your mom! Uncle? Had you had a father? Every single man has a father. What's on your mind right now? Formula Why did you lie to me? Don't polish it with dry cloth, you demage the varnish You 've got your place and those shoes… Why do you keep looking for a work to do? Can you imagine that you bring us to a shame? Kopčák's scamp has escaped form the school… Why is that? Who have you fought with? I though my little boy was the best in the world. I 'm not a little boy anymore! Then make a promise… ..you won't do it anymore! But I will! I will I will Jožko! Do you intend to maim him? Take care of your own kids! Marka! You are taking the revenge on your own misery. My girl. And the more you beat him, the worse. I know it well. I couldn't find the second one. Look at our new doorman! Old man has overslept so… So open the gate! What's that? A linden tea. With a rum? The sportsmen should not drink alcohol Here you are! I don't have any time for gargling! And leave the gate opened until the morning… Why are you not eating? Does it hurt? OK Show me your school diary! I left it in school. Why are making troubles? We've been understanding each other until now. You know, I love you. But the boys in school don't like me. They laught at me! Why? I don't even have the shorts for football. Good evening! Welcome, Suzi! What did you bring for us? Jožko's school bag and this shoe. Don't you say thank you? No way! Why did they fight? You can't say it, Suzanne! But Jožko has hit him only after… Dodo had started to swear at him! How? That he is a Formulka. But I never make fun of him. So… So that's why the fought. Uhm… Speak! Even my mommy said he could have a father. Ok, Suzi, OK I'll think about it. I feel so sorry for him! I've written a text for a punishment instead of him. What punishment? One hundred times. You just have to subscribe it. Well thank you, Suzi. You are so cute. Good night! Where does this come from? They've been carrying it whole night! The phone is ringing! Oh yes, he's been carrying it but he's crashed the tractor! More damage than utility We wanted to help you, that's all. Did you want the straw? There you go! As I can see, you've got no knowledge about the fire regulations ! I know one at least. If the fire is not burning you, don't extinguish it. Your laugh soon will be over. Marka? You'll make a deduction from wages to Tono… for breaking the records? For breaking the tractor.. If I shift this case to police, you are in a big trouble. Have you had any command for night ride? It was not illegal transportation. But there has been life threatening… My life only, dear chairman! Where is Kopčáková? She's not here already. Get her now! The cooperative farm is not a dovecot. If you escape, they bring you back handcuffed! Comrade chairman! The restaurant asked me on the phone, if we still are interested in swill. Yes of course. Don't hold my hand. They will laugh! Catch this! Kopčák family, get on! Go your own way! We have the common way. I want to sit here. Why are you fooling him? We are friends! Don't try hard. The chairman is longing for you too. Because of him? Run! Give this to your teacher. And after school go straight home! Do you know what I want from you? I 've crashed the tractor and right now I need every single penny. The race begins in two weeks. Do you copy me? And you leave my boy alone! His eyes are different. He's got shiny eyes! Bye! Kopčák! Go to the blackboard! Take a chalk and write I'm never gonna fight at school. Well? Who did those writing for you? Me You're lying. No I'm not. You are being kept in after school to write this again. You've left earlier yesterday anyway. Let them fight if they want to, the main thing is, they have food to eat and dress to wear. We've got different problems. So why did they fight? Because of a girlfriend? Because of Formula. Anywhere I look, there's no one but Formula. Do you know what has he done again? Tilka has told me, he had had a tyre defect. He has broken shift gear box , the half axle… and the cooler. How about the swill? Bad news. There's no one to carry it. It 's too smelly for everybody. Look, Marka You'll calculate out every single penny to Formula, whether he rides your boy on motorcycle or not! I'll keep an eye on it! Your tea is coming… A linden tea… I 'm looking for Formula. I don't dance. It's a pity! You could know a lot of news! So… take her Come on Shall we dance? I'm all ears! You have to marry a rich girl! This thing is going to cost 12000 bucks And I 'm supposed to make a deal with you about payments. Foreign currency! Foreign currency only! What would you like, Suzi? I 'm looking for Mr.Formula! There he goes Mr.Formula! Who has calculated that the repair would cost 12000 bucks? According to pricelist. Frame that pricelist for yourself. Is he there? He is outside. Mister, Jožko is being kept in after school! Who? Your friend Jožko Kopčák! Where? At school ! As a punishment. And he is crying! He was involved to fight because of you. You fool! The speed prolongs the life! I wonder, which tree you will scraped off from! I 'm not gonna make you that happy! I think you'd rather walk. Why are you doing all this to me? I only do the things I enjoy. Don't you dare to go for him! Is he here? Let me have a small talk with you. Truly, Marka Why did you write that punishment task instead of him? Why are you breaking his character? You've made him to lie! He was stultified ! They all keep on hurting him! He's scatterbrained and uneasy. You are the one who's hurting him! They swear at him! You should do something yourself! You can't just gag the kid's mouth, my dear. So what is your advice? I don't want to interfere with your private life… …but… the boy is in need of father. Tony Harant can't have a good influence. But you have to do something, my dear! Otherwise, he can blame you later for destroying his childhood And what you gonna tell him then? It's fantastic! So? Do you want to return? No, we'd better escape. Where to? Far away! Ok, let's scare them little bit. This is miraculous helmet. It can save the man from disaster. Now hold on tight. We have overtaken him! Well… He can never chase us! Watch out for rocks! Look! That's awesome! Oh my God, what a ride! If I had a new carburettor! Then a buy a new one! Smartass! Where could I get 800 bucks? Huh? Speed it up! Stop! Feeling dizzy? I'v e peed myself The motorcycle rider does say my reservoir's cracked. We didn't get too far. Where is he? The chairman? No, Formula. I thougt he was with you Should I send him to you? I get you.. I get you! You can never catch me! Just wait… What a heavy buttock of yours! And now let's try judo. Ok, let's go So, one more time You have to withstand the first hit. Yeah After the second hit you quickly grab the hand Turn with your back to him Then swing him over your shoulder and put him down on the ground. Let's do it again! Again! Now it's your turn. Watch out. This is the japanese judo, isn't it ? No the slovakian "čudo" (meaning - the strange thing) Listen carefully. The gentleman never attacks first. Especially not in the school. The gentleman defends himself only! Will you remember it? It's dry. We can go. And where to? You'll see. Get dressed! Formula? How does my father look like? Do you have photo album at home? Yeah Is he powerful? But you could overwhelm him, couldn't you? He deserves to be slapped! Coward! If you meet him, would you beat him? He escaped He was afraid of you, wasn't he? Look at those guests! Welcome! We've been living next door for three years now and we haven't seen each other closely. Come in! I'm looking for Jožko. Your son is hansome boy! Don't be modest! Though I don't have kids myself, I can reconsider that! And the uncle? Yes, he's been pampering him. I asked him not to do it, but he is obstinate and stubborn like a child ! Old man, you know. Today he forgot to buy a baking yeast, so Želmíra is not able to bake buns And he smokes too much, the whole flat smells like hell. So come on in. Želmíra is gonna be here any minute. I open the bottle of wine. You and my wife are cousins, aren't you? And that's the occasion to drink! And I admire you for all the things you can handle by yourself! Have you hatred for men? Listen Maria! I've got an concert in Piešťany on Sunday! Would you like to go with us…? Will you finish this today, Mišo? It's not a problem now. I'll handle it. I came to tell you the tractor will be repaired tomorrow morning! Not for a 12000 buck but for 12 bucks! Eighty five heaps. We're gonna be spreading that for more than week! Call back the Slovak immigrants from America, so they can earn some money. Are you roaming again? You'd better fix the manure spreader. It's done already. I spread it myself. In just a fifteen minutes. Don't you believe me? Let's bet For thousand bucks. Fool! Ok make it eight hundred bucks. Ok let's make it at least twelve bucks! Is he afraid of you? Get off! I need an order! What would you like to order? The date with you, but don't tell the chairman about it. It's our secret! Kopčáková was looking for you. What are you in common? Later…later Let's go If it gets worse, give this to her. I have to visit the city. See you in the morning. Bye The world has changed… We've raised 4 children and… and now you can see what's happening! Do oyu want to hurt yourself? Where have you been? Your mother has been looking for you in here for two times! Uncle, how could somebody earn 800 bucks? Are you getting married? I want to have a bicycle. Everybody has. You should have come to me 40 years ago. You would have been grazing my cows. O my God what a cows those were… Those big udders… You could have earned more than 800 bucks! Eat this. Thanks. Have you ever had a bicycle? I was too big cheapskate to buy it. Now I'm sorry. Why? I was a thrifty man? For the contrabass player. Don't even mention him. I've bought him a car. I 've given him deposit books… ..and now he's too thrifty to buy me a tobacco. My son is afraid of a lung cancer. And my daughter is the same. They have everything. Everything… … but children. Do you know what? Come here tomorrow. I give you those 800 bucks! I give you my own money, damn it! We'll choose the nice one … …chromed… with the bell… and when you enter the yard, you ring the bell like "crn crn crn" Of course I give you the money. You are the only friend of …mine. You smell like a manure. Where did he take you? To the stall? Yep! That's your father. How did you find him? Come here. I tell you something about him. I don't want. From you? From Formula. Tono is just a crazy fool! What's so special about him? Tell me! The motorcycle? He is afraid of nobody. Not even the afraid of chairman. And he is able to spread the manure by himself! And he'll take me to the race. I don't want to see you with him anymore! During summer holidays, you'll spend some time with your aunt in Trenčín. No I won't! Jožko! Open the door! No I don't Open the door, or else I'm gonna break it! And I'm gonna escape through the window! Good education he gave to you… It's closed! And the chief? So won't you open the door? I don't mind. Go for him. You'll both end up wrong! One day he goes to jail. No he does not. Good evening! I've brought him these books. Thank you Suzi, Jožko sleeps already. No he does not. I saw him standing by the window. And what is your homework for tomorrow? Nothing. We go for a trip. The teacher said we would have to be knowing the nature. Don't forget to bring the flowers to your mommy. And you don't forget to give the Jožko a lot of meal. He is hungry all the time. Good night, Suzi! Good night Where are we going to? Unlock the door and I tell you. You work as his slave handyman. Did you enchant you? Oh come one, Rózka… Shut up! The other guys are chasing the chores, they don't do anything for free, but you… You are ripping off your own family! Should I let my friend in troubles? My dear friendship man, who's gonna help you? It's here! The race begins on this Saturday! And good night! Oh, come one, Rózka. Rózka! It's not all. If you don't stop I splash you! Rózka… You can move to him, I don't care. Forever and ever! Come… your supper is getting cold… You can't get rid of me so easily! I need a the bell cable…one kilometer long Give it to him,so he can hang. But first have a supper with us! Come on, enough of sulking! You must be hungry for sure ! Can you hear me? I 'm not angry with you. You don't even have to visit your aunt! And I'm never goona write the punishment text instead of you! I'll buy you a football boots! Has Tono been here? What would he do here? He said he would come. Maybe he was here… while you were sleeping! This can happen once to you, too! Sometimes I really feel like fool. Wouldn't you feel better with you wife? Nope! You would not but how about me? Lady, look at my new bag my mom bought me! Nice one. Time to board! Come on, let's go? Next one What is that suppose to mean? Where're you taking them? They have a trip to nature so the chairman asked me to drive them. You are an expert in kidnapping children, Beware of you! I'll never do it again. Will it be enought to write it one hundred times? But in nice calligraphy! That's gonna be the hardest part! Your merit? Nope I didn't mean to hurt you yesterday, please forgive me. The most important thing is that nothing bad happened to Jožko. Will you drive safely? The best tractor driver in the region? Please Where would you like to go? To the nature. Ok to the hill. And there? You ĺl see the things you haven't seen before. Hop! Does the chairman know? Of course not. It's against the rules. You can frame those rules. Can't see their joy? Seems like you won 't Jožko let go with us. Yes she will, she promised me yesterday. Come. let's sit next to Formula. Nope! Kindly… Hey, stop singing! School voluntary work? Nope, the testing drive. As I told, it's repaired today. And they have the trip to nature, so I said to myself: Formula, it's time to do the good deed! And why didn't you take those old men? You've got your motorcycle and the others are afraid of my hazardous driving! Comrade chairman! The school'll never forget this! What? For driving us here! Such a trifle… When it takes our kids… They will see what they have not seen yet Tonko has something told me… We will spread this manure in no more than 15 minutes. I beg your pardon, but it's not the labor for kids! Let's bet again Ok let's make it 12 bucks Everybody move behind the tractor. Let's go. Everyone, even the old ones. Laco, get ready. Let's go boys. Your father couldn't do something like this! Stop it. Don't fight! A nice kind of circus. At least you don't have to call the Slovak immigrants from America. It's patentable. I serve to the people. There's only one thing I'd like to know - from where did you get so much of dynamite? You'll get the bill. For carbid. So, you are satisfied with this, aren't you? Very much… Laco has golden hands. He would deserve a reward. I can do that. But you have to help me. From tomorrow, you begin to carry the swills! A nice kind of reward. If you do that, you can practise every day. And you two, shake your hands! Should I beat you? I can still handle you, Formulka and with the Formula too, if he was here. Call him to help you! No you can't handle the Formulka! Don't let them do this, boys! Ouch… oh my leg… Hey, boy! Wait! I 'm looking for Tono Harant, do you know him? He is at the farm. I was told he's here. I don't know. Ask somebody else. Formula! Formula wait! There was cop looking for you over there! Good afternoon, Mr. Harant! Identification, please! We've got an indictment! For killing geese… for exceeding the speed limit… for a life treatening and for robbing the farm. You can't arrest him! He is the best tractor driver in the region and he wants to participate at the race. The boy…yours ? Stolen.. And I warn you in advance, I'm gonna steal his mother too! Look Mr. Harant… there's no time for a talk like this. Seems like those complaints are legitimate! And concerning the moto race… the farm didn't recommend you for that. By the way… …the exhaust does not comply with the regulations… …and who knows how about the brakes… Check it out! Check this! I will hold your driving license and prepare 500 bucks. Can you smell it? I'm cleaned out. I'll bring it I will I'll be back in no time. Wait for me! Money? Dunno. Listen, what have you been honored for ? Just because I gave the rules the deep six. Sorry? I've been plowing for three days and three nights without a break. You can ask for your drivinig license at the transport inspectorate! Hope you understand that you can't ride your motorcycle in the meantime. Come here and sit down. No I don't want to sit here. But how come you don't sit here? That' s because I don't want to sit at the front. Oh come on, don't act like a little boy. I have to sit in the back. No you can't father, you get cold. They will laught at you. Laugh? To me? I don't give a damn. People need the laughter. So, didn't you forget something? The tobacco my son in law promised m. And you bring my glasses. But it's here. No I want the ones my wife used to wear… It's very nice from you for coming to say goodbye. You asked me yesterday for coming, so here I am. There will be no bicycle… ..my boy. It's over. Where are you going? To the orphanage. I'm just the orphan. But they call it a retirement house. I 'm gonna miss you, boy. It's time to board, father. Oh yes. Thanks Jožko is home. From the work you came? From work to work. Easy! The labor is like a mother in law! The further she is, the better! I'm glad you are home already. There's something going on with the chairman… Imagine, he released me earlier! And do you know why? Your aunt from Trečín called me. She has got the apartment. Get dressed! Our bus is leaving at one o 'clock. Ok Hi You are taking the Mickey out of me! Me? You've made a promise to me… To take you for a ride? Catch this! Will we ever meet ? Tell me… Tonight? Ok then tomorrow. Tomorrow I'll be in a jail. Where do you take your motorcycle? I'm going to sell it. You have not approved my application for race … Me? Seems like the other person has… Do you mean Tilka? Or the other one. Get a wiggle on. The pigs are hungry! Thanks for reminding me. Launch! I did knocked on the door! This is for Jožko! He enjoyed it last time, so … But he is not home. I like this place. Listen to me Maria. Your boy has shown an interest for my contrabass. I could learn him lessons, free of charge of course. As a matter of fact, he is tone deaf. The main point is his courage. That's the most important thing for men. Get out! Thanks, uncle. Stop it! Jožko! Where is he? Dunno I really don't know. He might be at the playground. The race begins at 3 o'clock pm. Stop it! Stop! That boy worries me…let's go back. And the race? Turn it backwards! And the pigwash? I'm telling you, lets's go back! Wait There's someone inside the barrel. Look Crikey! Let's throw him into the the creek. Or better throw him to pigs. What is this? So they would give you back your driving license. Oh you… What happened? Don 't even ask You need the father for your bastard, so that's why you are after him! What a nonsense you talk! I can see through you. Just a few moments ago you followed him to the trailer. I've seen you. Wait! Tilka! There's no parking place in here! Where are you crowding through? To the race! I can manage that. So stop the tractor and go yourselves buy a tickets! Go go, just move out of the way. Us? You need us! You 've ordered the extinguishing mixture! In the wooden barrel? Keep your distance, it's under the pressure! What a joke! I'am serious, that barrel is just a external container! Gangway, people! Hey, what engine volume category is racing now? 125 cubic centimeter motorcycles draw to a close! Jump! Just because of you we almost missed it! We missed nothing! Come with me Are you audacious? What? I can't dissapoint him. And what about that cop? You don't even have a driving license! Jimminy! Good afternoon! Good afternoon. The telegram for you! From Trenčín? Long distance! From the begining you get the loss about 50 metres. But do the overcoming only when you feel sure. And watch out for the rocks, try to avoid them! You take care of Jožko! Don't worry, we're gonna keep our fingers crossed! Come! My dear friends, there's a black rider on the track! That's scandal and stultification! How could he get here? I don't know! But he is a dab hand at racing! Isn't that annoying he's messing the race? Please try to take a look at it as a coach, not as a sport comissioner! Shall we stop it? Certainly. Don't do that! Look, he's already taking the seventh position! Let's abridge the race to two laps. Speed it up! Attention please! Roger that. I'll call you back. Over! Watch out, he is running close! And lift that back of yours! Yeah, that's it. Speed up! Formula, speed it up! Are you Jožko? Kopčák? Cool! Have you seen it? He is an oldhand… Hooray! Third place! Who are you? Formula! Show me your driving license! I don't have any! Take him with his motorcycle too. Leave hime alone, immediately! Step back! Can you hear me? We will square accounts with him! He ain't go to jail, he ain't go to jail! Don 't worry, come. Step back! May I have your attention please! The arbitration commission announces that the racer who ended the race on third position must be disqualified, according to valid rules, because because he didn't fulfil requested conditions. Would like to contest for a prize tomorrow? I 'm sorry I didn't hear you. We've just lost our racer in 500 cc engine volume cathegory… If you dare, you can start the race tomorrow! I accept it only if you take him with me! We've got our own mechanics. Then let it go at that. Our career in racing has started at Formula 1 long ago. Do you know, what is Formula 1 ? Dunno Wooden board on four wheels! I used to damage all of them them and he was repairing them. I would be nothing without him. That's a pity. You'd better not to provoke them or else they come and crush you. And there's one more important thing - I'm going to jail tomorrow! You'd better go there now! I won't let him go. I won't! On wheels! But we don't have 500 bucks now! Explain that to your mommy where you've lost it. So you both come tomorrow and maybe I carry my proposal. But if you don't win, I don't want you. All right! We've almost won, mommy! Almost, mommy! Formula ended on third place. He could have been the first! And we go there again tomorrow. Would you go with us? Tell me you would! What is that you are wearing? There were nicer ones but also much more expensive. And put this to washing machine. He hid himself in the barrel. Put it where it belongs to. There are buns at the table for you. I bring some buns to Formula! I know, he adheres to you. Morbidly. But it all has to stop! So do we think too! I win the race and I come to you. Don't try so hard, I don't want it. I can wait long time. When you are ready. Formula! He said he wasn't hungry. And he said to me he would eat you too! Come with me, let's have a talk. I arranged with Formula that we don't want to make you angry. They will never laugh at you anymore. Your father has made himself heard. He wants to live with us! Read this. But I don't want him! He's just a coward! How can you talk like this about your father? As you may have heard, my dear fellow-citizens… …Tono Formula I mean Anton Harant has finished third at yesterday's race. Well, and today he will race on the biggest motorcycle. As a matter of fact, it's indeed good for us. They will better notice us at the administration of county. They will say…hey Calm down! You are a big boy now. You have to understand these things. When your father comes he buys you even two motorcycles. And promise me you'll never escape. I just have a little wash and we go. The aunt is gonna wait for us at bus stop. So don't hesitate and come with us The bus is waiting for you in front of the local bureau. Dear fellow citizens, come and stimulate Anton Harant to victory. God-speed! This helmet can protect him! Good morning! So let's go Kopčák's family, let's go. Where's your mommy? There she is. Are you looking forward? More than to a Slovak lesson? I believe you'll be better at school. Mrs. teacher, please tell aunty Kopčáková we go in advance. Formula has turned on the whole village. So I said to myself I can't miss that. I take a drive with you, Marka, if you don't mind. But I… Tono will take a good care of you. We are leaving to Trenčín with Jožko. How come? Jožko is already in the bus with Zuzka. Dear viewers. Today's race of the 500 cc cathegory promises the never before seen fight. We've got six first class racers… .. two champions of Slovakia …and four adepts for representative dress. So we can be really delighted. The racers will take 45 minutes long part in race and two laps. I say - risk but don't gamble with your health! Did Kopčák family come? Don't even think about women. Be careful. This machine is as sharp as a razor. Please, clear the track for the start. The racer number five comes from Martin and his name is Ján Koniar. The racer number six is from Puchov and his name is Jozef Počarovský. Because of the shortness of time I just want to remind you, that number 13 belongs to Tono Harant, born in the village Brehy. This likeable racer is just coming out. We wish him good luck! Mee too! Stay here. The girls are not allowed to go there. Take this, so you'll be dammed lucky! Go back, I've got my own! Your mom's trembling for your safety. No she is not. She went to Trenčín. Be off, boy! Dear friends, everything is ready for the start. We wish all the racers final place and to you thrilling experience! Don't hesitate, you know this place well! You fool, do you think he could hear you? Needles to say! What do you have those foot pegs for? What do you have those foot pegs for, Formula? Aunty, aunty… Jožko is over there. Where? There! The winner of this race has the right to start at the Championship of Slovak republic which will take the place on this track at August 23rd of this year. And here we have the first retiring racer. His name is Štefan Veselý from Považská Bystrica. The leader of the race is still Zdenek Bureš… …in hot pursuit with the racer number 2 - Michal Škutina. I must not speak too soon, but there we have the first suprise. The race debutant Anton Harant with number 13 is getting to the 7th position. Madam, you can't enter the track, come back! There's your mom coming! Oh, I saw him here just a few minutes ago. There he goes! Tell him we stay here. OK! I hope you agree with me, my dear friends …that this race is simply wonderful! Just take a look at those jumpings! Just for your information I'm notifying you that we are above first 10 minutes of the racing. Dear friends! the situation is changing, racer number 13 is attacking the 3rd position. The racing bravery of this racer is really admirable! Speed up if don't want to carry the pigwash forever ! If he wins I compensate you everything! Take him! Excellent! And don't save the fuel! Where are you going? To Jožko, he bolts off like a frightened rabbit. We have to catch him! No pain no gain! Jožko, your mom's asking you to stay here. Wait, I want to be the Formula's friend too! Tono, don't give up! Organizers, attention! Organizers, attention! Watch out for kids on the track! Jožko!!! Formula! Formulka! This happened because you didn't take your miraculous helmet! When it's the next race? Never! But there will be a hard times with both of us!
