Before the 911 call, what did you specifically hear Mrs. Lawson? I heard a man scream I'm gonna fucking kill you. And then I heard gunshots. Do you know who said those words? Your Honor, she's speculating. According to Mrs Lawson police report she did see who said those words. Is that an objection? Yes that is an objection. Then say objection. Sustained. Counsel, no need to directly address Counsel. Thank you. I'll rephrase the question. Does that voice sound like the defendants, as he was banging and screaming at your door. Yes it does. Right after the gunshots what did you see? I saw a Black man running, he was wearing a hoodie. He had this deathly look on his face. He looked very angry. His nostrils was flaring. Objection, Your Honor. The question has been asked and answered. The witness is painting presumptive image of the defendant to the jury. Motion to strike her last response. Sustained. Alright ladies and gentlemen, you are to disregard the descriptive portion of the answer Mrs. Lawson gave of the defendant. Mrs. Lawson? Can you please listen carefully to Counsel's questions and answer precisely as you can? And please don't suggest any extra information, thank you. Sorry. Now after seeing the defendant running towards you It looked liked he was a carrying a gun. I was petrified. No further questions. Counsel. Mrs. Lawson, How long have you lived in The Woodlands? About thirty years. And where did you live before that? Back east. East what? East Detroit, East Jersey, East New York? Oklahoma. Oklahoma. Mrs Lawson, does Oklahoma have lots of black folks? Objection, Your Honor. Your Honor this has everything to do with her testimony or irreverence of. Counsel, where you going with this? Your Honor, we are asking for the impeachment of Mrs. Lawsons testimony I just obtained a police report from Oklahoma City, dated December 23rd, 1993. Where the witness made inaccurate and defamatory statements about her neighbors, whom I might add are Black. And I quote, it was probably all the black people next door doing all the break-ins. Mrs. Lawson also has a bench warrant issued in Oklahoma city because of her statements. What? I didn't know anything about this, I moved. Objection, Your Honor. Prior criminal acts are irrelevant character evidence under Rule 404. Your Honor, we are offering, this as impeachment evidence under Rule 608. The court grants impeachment of Mrs Lawson. Jury will disregard all testimony by Mrs Lawson. Alright, ladies and gentlemen, at this time we will take a brief 20 minute recess. I'm gonna ask you to step back in the jury room. Please, remember my admonition to you, don't discuss the case amongst yourselves, form any opinion, and don't allow anybody to talk to you about the case. Welcome back to Burden of Proof As always I'm joined with Black activist and community leader Quentarius X I'm your host Tori Lahren Due to the complexity of the case and decency involving sexual assault the Judge has chosen to exclude all non courtroom personnel. And to close the trail to the public. To lesson the ongoing humiliation of the victims and witnesses. What are your thoughts? What we saw this past week between the prosecution and media, a smear campaign. Spread across the nation. The racial injustice of black people. To have this young brother's character, his future, and livelihood. If you're not guilty what are you running from? Do not interrupt me, okay? I did not interrupt you do not interrupt me. To answer your question, The young brother was protecting himself, from these animals, in a predominately white neighborhood. Animals? Yes, animals. This young brother has lit a fire to all the young brothers and sisters, that they will not go back to the mental the spiritual and psychological slave plantation. That has been this corrupt judicial system, aimed at enslaving the black man. This is not a race thing. It's not a white thing, black thing, gay thing. This is a wrong versus right thing. It's always about race when a black man is charged. Guilty until proven innocent, according to you white folks. Guilty as his color. He committed a violent crime. If it was up to me, if it were my child he'd be locked away for life. Allegedly. And it's not up to you, it's up to the Jury. And if your son attempted a vile act on my manhood, expect the same reaction. I don't care who you are. You condone this kind of violence? If the glove fits expect to get hit. Prove to me he's innocent. You have eye witnesses, DNA, physical and circumstantial evidence. But you started off saying he's guilty by the color of his skin. No. He's guilty by the evidence. But you keep on using Black privilege to Yes, Black privilege. I said it. To say that everything is racist. You seem unwilling concede that the evidence is stacked against him. But sure blame it on the color of his skin. But yet, deep down, deep down inside you know he's guilty. You have a black student, a man of God. an athlete, good looking, mentally and physically intelligent. But reality says that this young brother can't escape being Black in America. And at the end of the day, they give you brothers a negro wake-up call. The only thing this young brother was guilty of is being Black and intelligent in America. And they pulled this brother's Black card. (sigh) (Murmurs) (Door closes) What is this? Huh? (Elevator ring) Lord have mercy. Lord Jesus. Homie, that's fucked up. What? Why'd you snitch on Josh? We both Black, brotha. You know they gonna hire him before they hire me. It's 2020 homie, quit playing the victim. I'm not playing the victim. What he did was wrong. In the eyes of the Lord, in the eyes of the law, I did the right thing. I didn't do nothing wrong. Man, that's fucked up, nigga. Alright, see ya Sunday at service. Fuck you, nigga! He needs Jesus. I should pray for him. Father God, please pray for these heathens. Hey, motherfucker! Hey! Why'd you snitch on me, huh? You fucking bitch! Hey, turn around when I'm talking to you. Get your dirty heathen hands off me. You cheated yourself. What's wrong with you? That heathen talking about I'm costing him money. If you didn't sin we wouldn't have to worry about all that foolishness. Hey! You stole $25,000 from me, 2 years and my scholarship. All for nothing! You cheated yourself. Stop sinning so much. Now move before I let Jesus take the wheel. Move. Get out of the car. Praise Jesus you charlatan. You need to worry about getting right with God. My scholarship is gone, my scholarship is gone. Silver and gold we may not have. But your eternity is gonna be in hell, you damn heathen. Timothy it is ye whom are held captive with the gay demons of hell. But Jesus came to proclaim freedom to the captives. Amen. Amen?! Amen Pastor! Y'all sound like y'all was on they side, Amen. He has come to set free from the gay demons. Amen. Amen, amen! This is serious, Brother Tim. I'm not trying to chastise you but the Bible does say, The sexual behavior described is orgiastic, not that of a loving, mutual, caring, committed relationship. For this very reason God gave them over to degrading passions. Now does this sound familiar? Amen, Pastor. For their women exchanged the natural function for that which is unnatural, and in the same way the men abandoned the natural function of the woman and burned in their desire toward one another. Men with men committing indecent acts and receiving in their own persons the due penalty of their error." Oh yeah? What does the Bible say about snitching? You two-faced lying ass bitch! Ah, brother Josh! We're so glad you are able to attend today's sermon. Fuck you you piece of shit! Josh, Jesus loves and forgives you, brother. Come here. So do not fear, for I am with you; do not be dismayed, for I am The Lord, your God. I will strengthen you and I will help you. I will uphold you with my righteous right hand. Come on with it, brother. The Lord is my Shepard. Oh shit! Take one of these heathen. Heathen. Oh, y'all don't believe in Jesus? Ok Satan. You tried to hit with some temptation, dodge. Holy Fist! You not ready for the righteous right. Righteous right hand! You and your little demons. Hey, you're Michael. That preacher, Street Jesus. Yeah. Do I know you? I saw you during wrestling match during a meet. Did I win? Yes, you did. You still in USCA? Yeah, I'll be there probably till next year. Hopefully I'll graduate in spring. Fingers crossed. Fingers crossed. So, you're signing up to train here? Yes, I did. I think every women should learn some self- defense. Especially Ju Jitsu. Definitely. Maybe we can roll around the mat. I can show you some things. Right. Ok, well I'll see you, gotta go. Wait. What was your name again? Nicki. It was good meeting you. See you soon? Maybe. Well, you know they don't call me Street Jesus for nothing. If you'd like to visit my ministry sometime. Here's my card. Oh, I'm sorry. I got you. Oh, ok. Honestly, I'm not into the whole God preacher thing. No offense, thanks though. Bye. None taken my sister. None taken at all. I guess I'll see you around sometime. Blessed are you, Lord, all- powerful God, who in Christ, the living water of salvation, blessed and transformed us. Grant that when we are clothed with this Holy cloth or make use of it we will be refreshed inwardly by the power of the Holy Spirit. The power of the Holy Spirit and continue to walk protected in the new life we received at Baptism. The Creator of all things by water and the Holy Spirit. You have given the universe it's beauty and fashioned us in your own image, Father God. Bless and purify this into a Holy Shirt. We ask this though Christ our Lord. Amen. I feel the anointing. Glory to God. Are y'all ready to see the power of the Lord? Yeah! Father God please make my bullets go straight. Brother Tim, are you ready? What the hell you doing preacher? Amen. I'm fine. I'm ok, that shit works! That shit work. Holy Shirt! Thank you Jesus, thank you Jesus! Amen, give him a round of applause for the Lord. Amen. Alright ladies and gentlemen, come forward we have Holy Shirts in all shapes and sizes. Come on forward. Even some for the little children. the Lord loves the children. Amen. It looks good on you, too, brother. It does. Nicki. Sister Nicki, thank you so much for stopping by my ministry. Are you leaving so soon? Yeah, I'm good. I was just walking by. Anytime, my sister, anytime. My doors are open. This week I encourage you to pray for the Lord to close close any doors that need to be closed for you. And to ask the Lord to break any chains that need to be broken. I feel as though you already know what I'm talking about. But you just need to give them over to the Lord. After all, He is the God of all open doors. And my doors are always open. Sure. I know your Deeds. I have placed before you an open door that no man can close. See, I know that you have little strength, yet you have kept your word and have not denied my name. and have not denied my name. See ya brother. You call this the Ali shuffle, I call this the Jesus shuffle. Hey! Hey Nicki! I was thinking of sermon last night. It was beautiful. It was beautiful. Yes, thank you. How are you doing? How's it going? It's going. Yeah, where's it going to? Out tonight. If I didn't know any better I think you was trying to invite me out somewhere. Maybe. It's a free country if you wanna come. Alright, so where we going? This place might not be a place for you? Might not be a place for me? I'm a man of God and God is everywhere, therefore everywhere is a place for me. You understand? (Dance music) Your dancing is almost as your attitude. You don't have a problem about being around certain people. I feel like we are just children of God. You wanna come to my place? That was kind of random dont you think? Well, my roommate isn't there so we can just chill and talk. Chill and talk? Ok. Do you mind taking me to my car? Where is it? After leaving the bar, what happened next? We were driving around the parking lot. Looking for Michael's car. I was getting scared, having doubts his car was towed away. What made you think that? Because it was late and we were alone together. Are you sure you parked here? Girl, yes I'm sure I parked here. How many times I gotta tell you that? Don't yell at me ok? I'm trying to be helpful. My shift is over and its late. Your car probably got towed. I know it sucks but let's just relax for minute. I'm not driving around frustrated. Alright, you know what? I'm sorry. My fault. But I wasn't yelling, though. No, it's my fault. I had a couple drinks. I'm frustrated right now. No, its fine. I had a good time, for real. Really? Well that's good. So, what do you want to do now? I thought we was going back to your place. What about your car? Don't even worry about. I'll go get it in the morning. Its really not important. But let me keep you if you got work in the morning. No. Definitely taking the night off. Oh yeah, what do you do for work? I'm in the entertainment business. Oh, an actress. Girl, can you sing? Girl, can you sing? Something like that. It's cool, it pays the bills. You want to call it a night? I'm fine. Wow! Your eyes look amazing. I know. Thank you. Wait, Preacher are you getting fruity with me? Oh no, I'm sorry. Forgive me. Lord Jesus. I couldn't resist. The temptation was too much. I'm so sorry. Relax, don't go off and kill yourself. No. No. No. I just have to repent in the name of Jesus. Lord please forgive me. I'm so sorry. Look, I'm so sorry. I'm not gonna touch you for the rest of the night. I promise. Are you a man of your word? Yeah, if you don't have your word, what do you have? I like you. You're different. So are you. Whoa! Praise Jesus. Glory to God! God is good. So, are we going back to my place now? Yeah. Sure. Why not? So, it was Mr. Robinson who initiated the first kiss? Yes. Did you enjoy it? It was ok. Did he enjoy it? He had no complaints. Until there was a witness. Are you sure about this? I don't want to cause any issue. Yes, my roommate is never here. Alright, but you do realize I'm Black. And this is a pretty fancy neighborhood. I don't want anyone calling the police, thinking I'm breaking in. Oh, shut up. You do realize I'm different. Besides, I'll be your witness. Now come inside! That's what they all say. I'll change. Get comfortable. Help yourself to the fridge, bathroom is down the hall. Ok, for sure. Y'all got chicken in here? Hell yeah. I knew this was a bougie house y'all got organic stuff. At first we were very chill. Watching Netflix. But he kept on pushing himself on me. Kissing me on my neck, grabbing my hand. Did you tell him to stop? No. He completely ignored all my non-verbal cues. Were you afraid? No. Not at that moment. What happened next? He started reaching for my breasts, my thighs. And you said? Whoa, let's relax for a little bit. Shouldn't we get to know each other better? I already know a lot about you. I googled you. And I have to say it is amazing how brave you are. I hate the internet. How did that make you feel? I felt at ease. I felt very comfortable with him and at that moment we let our inhibitions go. What happened next? We resumed kissing. One thing led to another, next thing Michael aggressively grabs the back of my hair. And I briefly performed oral sex, at his request. And he tried to do the same on me. Did you want to perform these sex acts? Not really. I tried to be nice. Lay back. It's my turn. No, no, no. it's fine. Let's talk. Let's talk? I don't want to do anymore talking. Just lay back. I don't remember much. But I remember Josh coming into the living room, Hey, what are you doing?! Yelling. Trying to get Michael off me. Hey man, get off her! What the fuck man? Ouch, stop! Shit! Stop! What was he saying when he was pounding your face with his fist? (Nicki screaming) He was yelling you punk bitch. I'm going to fucking kill you. Next thing I remember was waking up in the hospital with my face rearranged. That's all I remember. I'd like to present to the jury photo evidence of Michael The Beast Robinson's art work. This is the rage. Roar. The handy work of Michael The Beast Robinson. Look at it. Look at it. No further questions. Counsel, your witness. Your Honor, Counsel would like to request a 20-minute break, so that Ms. Wise may gather herself. Granted. Ms. Wise, you may step down. We'll see you back here in 20- minutes. My offer still stands. Save your boy. Take the plea deal. Let's not milk the tax payers any further. I'm not registering as a sex offender. Do you think you can you win this case or not? I always think I can win. But it's also my job to advise on you what I think is best. But ultimately it's your choice. Now if you want me to continue to fight for you, I will. And I do think you should take take the stand. Tell your side of the story. But you have to be honest with me now about what really happened that night. So I can maneuver a way around it. I already told you nothing sexual happened. How did your DNA end up in her mouth, Michael? We just kissed, that's it. It was your semen. These are the questions the prosecution will probe and prove. Maybe she put her hands in her mouth after grabbing my stuff. I don't know. But the motherfucker is lying! You know what Michael? There's three sides to a story: There's yours, theirs, and the truth. Now let me remind you of the charges you're facing. Felony aggravated assault, attempted murder, Evidence tampering, assault with a deadly weapon. Oral copulation by force, intimidation of a witness, and a hate crime. Now, I can beat all these charges. But I need you to be truthful up there. No matter how emasculating, how embarrassing it is, the truth needs to come out. But if you want to take a plea deal, that's up to you. No pleas deal. I can't. It's either freedom or give me death. Ok. Let's go prove your case. Counsel? Ms. Wise, How long have you known Josh Stevens? About a year. And you guys are roommates, correct? Yes. Has Mr. Stevens ever mentioned Mr. Robinson to you? Yes. What did he say? He said he has this friend he wanted me to go out with. Ok. Was it Mr. Stevens that text you that the house was all yours that night? Yes. And did Mr. Stevens know you were with Mr. Robinson? Nicki: Yes. Ms. Wise, are you currently working? How can I? I'm still recuperating from my injuries caused by Michael. Were you working prior to your injuries? Yes. What kind of work did you do? Entertainment. What kind of entertainment exactly, Ms. Wise? I'm an escort. Darnell: Oh. So you are paid to entertain people? Yes. Did Mr. Stevens pay you to entertain Mr. Robinson? Yes. How much did Mr. Stevens pay you to entertain Mr. Robinson? Out-going, I charge $200 per hour, $2,400 total. Does that entertainment include sex? Prostitution is illegal. Any sex act Michael and I acted upon was our own freewill. Did Mr. Stevens ask you to perform any sex acts on Mr. Robinson? Why would he? He just paid me to give him a good time. Ms. Wise, does a good time include oral copulation? Objection, Your Honor! Ms. Wise has already stated prostitution is illegal. Sustained. Ms. Wise, you knew Mr. Stevens was pranking Mr. Robinson. No. You first met Mr. Robinson at the karate dojo, correct? That is where Mr. Steven told you can find Mr. Robinson. Yes. And your second encounter was at the church, correct? Yes. And you use the ladies locker room, correct? Heather: Objection, Your Honor. Irreverent question. Sustained. Ms. Wise, do you pee standing up or sitting down? Objection, Your Honor! That is totally disgusting and insulting, and none of his business! Sustained. Counsel, let's not ask questions like that. (Sighs) Ms. Wise, at what age did you want to be a girl? I am a girl. A woman. I'll rephrase my question. At what age did you realize you are a girl? 5 or 6. What's your definition of a girl? Objection, Your Honor. This is not a psychological analysis. Overruled. Nicki. Can you repeat the question? What makes you a girl? It's a feeling. Being feminine. I like girls clothing, shoes, make-up. How did your parents raise you, Ms. Wise? My late mother raised me well. Would you say she raised you in a way that was gender nonconforming? Gender creative. Oh, gender creative? Ms. Wise, what does your birth certificate say? Nonbinary. You recently had your birth certificate changed? Yes. Were you born a male or female? I'm definitely female. Ms. Wise, what sexual organ were you born with, male or female? Objection! Ms. Wise has already answered that she is female. Overruled. Ms. Wise? That's none of your business. Ms. Wise, please answer the question. What sexual organ were you born with? Yes. I have a penis. Sorry, Your Honor. Ms. Wise, does it get hard? Objection! Counsel is being disgusting and rude, again! Counsel, I will hold you in contempt. Did you disclose this information to Mr. Robinson, that you have a penis? Yes! Darnell: When did you disclose this? I'm not sure when. Was it before or after the alleged oral copulation? Objection! Your Honor, she's already stated she doesn't remember when she disclosed her anatomy status. Sustained. So is it possible it may have slipped your mind in disclosing your anatomy status? I don't think so. Michael said he googled me. You've signed job applications before, correct? Yes. And when seeking a job, on that application, doesn't that job want to know your work history? Yes. Darnell: When seeking a potential sex partner, as a transgender person, is not your moral and ethical obligation to inform the potential sex partner of your transgender status before sexual relations? Objection. It's an opinionated question and answer. Overruled. I'll repeat the question. Is not your moral and ethical obligation to inform a potential sex partner of your transgender status before sexual relations? No. Given the prevalence of transphobia in the population and the associated violence, wouldn't disclosure maximize your safety? Mr. Robinson is a violent person. That's all there is to that. Let's just say you may have forgotten to disclose your anatomy status to Mr. Robinson, you do understand why he would be upset? Perhaps. But that doesn't justify violence. You attended Northern Idaho Christian University, correct? Yes. And you were expelled for fraud? Correct? No. I was accused of fraud. I left on my own volition. You were accused of fraud because you checked female instead of male on your application, is that correct? Either way, I still would've been accused of fraud had I checked "male" had I checked male and shown up to orientation looking like a female. Is that the reason why you had your birth certificate gender changed to nonbinary, to avoid future fraud allegations? Part of it. You know Ms. Wise, we actually have a lot in common. I too, feel I am not who I see in the mirror. Objection, your Counsel is speaking about his-self. Your Honor, permission to continue my cross examination as it has pertinenceto the case. Overruled. As I was saying Ms. Wise, you know we have a lot in common. I too, feel I am not who I see in the mirror. You see I always felt like a White man. I consider myself a White man. I feel like I'm a White man stuck in a Black man's body. What's so funny, Ms. Wise? Nothing. You don't think think I'm a White male? Objection, Your Honor! Your Honor, I'm merely demonstrating how we perceive ourselves and the relevancy it has to this case. Your Honor. Overruled. I talk like a White man, I act like a White man. You don't think I'm a White man? No. And why not? Because you're Black. No further questions, Your Honor. Why'd you do it, Michael? Are you a violent person? Are you gay, Michael? You gay? Why'd you do it Michael? Michael, do you like booty? Man, hell nah I don't like no booty! What's wrong with you?! I'm pissed off because he's running late. All rise. The Honorable Judge Yang is now presiding. Where's Counsel Williams? Said he was running late. Mr. Williams, step forward. Counsel, what are you doing? I'm coming out. Coming out of what? The closet, Your Honor. I'm transracial. Darnell, don't make a mockery of my courtroom. I'm not. This is who I am. I'm being serious, Your Honor. Let's begin. I call to the stand, Josh Stevens. Why did you hire Ms. Wise to entertain Mr. Robinson? I just wanted to play a little prank on Michael. Did you expect him to react violently? No. Heather: It wasn't your idea they have a sexual relation? No, it was not. Nor my intention. Why did you invite Ms. Wise to go to Mr. Robinson's church? Josh: I don't know. She said she was feeling depressed, so I was like maybe she needs Jesus in her life. And I wanted her to meet Michael. With him being a man of God, I thought he would be more accepting of her. Why did you feel the need to pay Ms. Wise? She said she was short on cash. I just wanted to help out. You didn't tell Ms. Wise to invite Mr. Robinson home? Absolutely not. I didn't know he was there until I saw him. What exactly happened that night in the house? It was about 2am, I get out the shower. Hello? Nicki, is that you? Then I heard voices downstairs. So I creep down because I wanted to jump-scare Nicki, and record her reaction. Wait, wait, stop. Was she revisiting him? No, but she was uncomfortable with his aggressiveness. Did you hear Mr. Robinson say he had googled her? No. I missed that part. But this is what I heard. I have something to tell you. If you don't want to do this, we don't have to keep going. No, it's not that. I like you. But I'm afraid you won't like me anymore if I tell you what I am. Girl, it doesn't matter to me what you are, or what you have to tell me. I'm still gonna like you the same. Really? Yeah. What you got to tell me? Well, I'm different. Different? Like are you a werewolf or something? I have a penis. I was born a male. But I'm still a female. I'm a woman. Yeah, I already knew. I knew you had a dick. But that doesn't change how I fell about you. Ooh. Michael, you are gay! Josh! I'm telling everybody. What are you doing here? I'm filming his gay ass. You know him?! Yeah, this is my house. AY, you keep on recording me like that. Yes, I can. This is my house. Delete that shit, man! Nope! Man, give me that shit! Wait. You can legally sue him. Don't get yourself in trouble. You set me up! Michael then punched Nicki in the face and knocked her out. And he pounded on her. He was screaming you set me up, you faggot ass bitch. And that's when he started attacking me. I then suplexed him. Stop man! Damn man! I don't want to hurt you. I was only joking! But fuck, man! I'll erase it. But you didn't have to hurt her. Bullshit. Let me see your phone. I don't trust you. You know what, man? DO it yourself! Whoa, dude. Fuck you! Now you gonnna die! Whoa bro! Hey! It's not that serious, man. Hey dude, listen, I'm not gonna tell anybody that you're gay. I was just joking! I'm not gay! I don't like boys! Alright, calm down! It's too late for you. You will now meet the Lord! Don't try to run either. Now, come here. (Whipping sound) Lord, Jesus. I got in my boxing position. I ducked his swing and punched him a few times in his face and knocked him out! You a damn lie! You know the truth. Mr. Robinson! I will throw you out of here and hold you in contempt if you disrupt this courtroom again. And then what happened? Dude, now get out of my house. Before I have to call the cops. Let's go. Nicki? Are you ok? You're all right, just stay there. Hey bro, get the fuck out of my house. (Gun shots) Why did you fire two shots at Mr. Robinson? Because I was afraid for my life. Michael unlawfully entered my home. No further questions. Counsel? Do you always keep a gun on you after a shower? I grabbed it when I heard noises downstairs. Can never be too careful nowadays. Where are your parents Mr. Stevens? They live in Europe. They didn't bother to come and support you, during a time like this? They're busy. And this is nothing I can't handle. How did you meet Ms. Wise, over a year ago? She answered my 'room for rent' ad. And you were aware Nicki was transgender? Not at first. How did you become aware of this? I did a background check. What else did you find out about Ms. Wise? I found out about her lawsuit against her school. And other media sources from Idaho. Were you aware she was an escort? Yes. Have you ever dated Ms. Wise? Hell no. Do you consider Mr. Robinson a good friend? Well, I thought we were friends. Until he reported you for cheating on your test? Yes. You can say that. You felt betrayed by him. Yes. But, I realize it was wrong of me to cheat. I take full responsibility for it. And I paid the price for it too. So when inviting Ms. Wise to Mr. Robinson's church, your intentions wasn't to provoke or embarrass Mr. Robinson? Not really. It was just a joke. A $2,400 joke? It was just a prank. Sick prank. When you wanted to jump scare Ms. Wise, what was your goal in recording Mr. Robinson and Nicki? Nothing, really. I just thought it was funny, at first. What was so funny? That Michael was making out with a dude. A transgender? Yeah. I didn't know he was gay. He's not gay. Well, whatever, doesn't matter. You didn't try to extort or blackmail, Mr. Robinson for two semesters lost? You didn't threaten him with posting the video online, if he didn't pay up? Of course not. I gave him my phone to erase it. So it was your intention to record Ms. Wise and Mr. Robinson together? They came into my house. Yes or no answer. Yes. But, I didn't tell them to perform any sex acts. That was between them. But you knew this would anger Mr. Robinson? Not really. But I am not responsible for his violent actions. He attacked us with a hammer. Are we to believe a cheater's testimony? Someone who cheats on exams to get ahead. I cheated, and I regret it. But I'm not lying. Cheating is lying, Mr. Stevens. You see I have a theory. You did your little background check, and you lured Mr. Robinson to your home, and rovoke him. You planned this extravagant scheme to humiliate, retaliate and extort Mr. Robinson. By using Ms. Wise's transgenderism and record them getting intimate. You wanted revenge because he snitched you out for cheating isn't that right Mr. Stevens? Not true. It was just a prank. You can't prove I tried to extort anyone. Oh, I think we have, Mr. Stevens. Beyond a reasonable doubt. It's not what you think. It's what you can prove in the court of law, Counsel. And when he rebuffed your evil game, that you conspired against him you provoked him into a fight, in which you lost. Then you went and got your gun and you tried to kill him, isn't that true Mr. Stevens? Not true. I was defending myself. No further questions, Your Honor. I'm done with Mr. Stevens. The defense is making a mockery of transgenders, himself and this case. A total disservice. You want to talk about animals? Disgusting. He beat her half to death. A few bruises. A few? What are you, blind? She looked like she was hit by a bus. Like she was attacked by a violent animal. A beast. Mauled and attacked by a beast. The brother was attacked and violated. Oh, he was not. Nicki was in the living room, while Michael was still in the closet. Are you implying the young is a homosexual? What I'm asking is what's he doing in a gay bar? And why was he so comfortable with Ms. Wise? It was lesbian night. The young brother likes women. And what we have here is the effeminization, subjugation, demonization, emasculation of a young black man of his holy ways and God given dignity. A violation orchestrated by Josh and Nick. False accusations. And her name is Nicki. Nicki, It, Nick, the point is Nick has a dick. You do not violate another man's dignity in the most sickest, heinous, and slyest ways! And record it? That's dirty. Now, that's unfair, Quentarius. When you refer to Nicki as It, it's dehumanizing. You're right. Nicki deserves respect as a human but loses my respect for deception. Michael's actions was justified. Bravo to the defense. Well played. Black dignity matters. Michael knew Nicki was transgender. He was just caught with his hands down the pickle jar and reacted with violence. and reacted with violence. And it is not just black dignity that matters. White dignity matters. Gay and trans dignity matters, all human dignity matters. We all have red blood. We should be judged by the content of our character. Not by the color of our skin, sexual orientation, our height, what we wear, whatever. And I've been mocked plenty of times for the color of my skin, You know I've been called a white cracker bitch on social media. Tori, they don't mock you cause the color of you're skin. They mock you because of the stupid things you say. And all the people that mock you has nothing to do with the continual degradation of black peoples for over 500 years. This young brother was sexually assaulted and humiliated by TWO WHITE MEN, not one. You know, Quentarius, when you say things like that, that's why you haven't really risen passed a certain level. Michael is not the victim here. He was the aggressor and offender. And you're using black privilege again to pull the race-card. And that's not what this case is about. What is this black privilege you speak of? Oh, like you don't know. Every time something doesn't go your way, you're screaming racism. When the police pull you over, it's racism. when profiled in suspicion of a crime, it's racism. When profiled in suspicion of a crime, it's racism. If it's educational, political or income disparities, you scream systematic racism. How about just being accountable? How about taking accountability for the 70% of crimes committed by black people? Is that racism? No. They are statistical facts. And that's part of the reason why whitey always calls the cops. Because white people are scared, Quentarius. Not because they are racists. It's because what the black culture perpetuates, and that needs to be addressed. If you want to talk about culture, let's talk about facts. Whites commit more violence in America. You got crazy little white boys running around shooting and killing innocent people in schools and churches. You got serial killers whom are predominantly white men. But, you're scared of black folk? No, sister, you need to study the white culture. It's not just white people killing and shooting each other. Go study the statistics in Chicago. Blacks are shooting and killing each other at an enormously high rate. But wait a minute, you just said blacks are committing most of the crimes. But address the black culture with the perpetual chip on your shoulder, always blaming whitey. Show some respect! Respect? Don't tell me a damn thing about black culture! When it's crazy, little white boys murdering all kinds of innocent people! So don't tell me that. We need to study these fanatic white boys! Ok, so when black on black crimes stop going down in inner cities, you let me know, until then stop blaming whitey. I live in the inner-city. What have you done for black communities, other than play the perpetual victim? I have had fundraisers there. I've given back to inner cities. I have helped and taught there. Guess what? At the end of the day, beware of false teachers who come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves. Let me tell you something, how dare you say that to me. It's the truth when it comes to you. Before going to Club Shabby, did Ms. Wise warn or tell you That it was a gay club? No. Do you frequent gay bars? No. This was my first time. Why didn't you leave when you found out it was a gay bar? Why would I leave? I was having fun. I don't discriminate against fun. You were dancing with gay men, yes? I was dancing with everybody on the dance floor. Again, I don't discriminate. Is that you dancing in this video? Yes. Looks like you having a gay ol' time. Weren't you? Yes. But are you gay? No. Doesn't seem to me he hates gay people. I don't. Doesn't seem to me he should be charged with a hate crime. Or anything. I know. When you googled Ms. Wise, what were you searching for? I wanted to see her track videos, see her run. Did you see anything about her transgender status? No. I saw nothing of it. Before Ms. Wise invited you in, did she tell you about her transgender status? No. She never did that. How did you find out? For this you know with certainty, that no immoral or impure person or covetous man, who is an idolater, has an inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God. Come on, put the book down Look here now, I'm trying to save your soul. Come here, girl. Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools. And changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and four-footed beasts, and creeping things. Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonor their own bodies between themselves: Who changed the truth of God into a lie. And worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen. For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature: And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust for one toward another. Men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompense of their error which was meet. I don't a sermon right now, I want some affection. Whoa, wait, hey. Look, we just met. Shouldn't we get to know each other a little better first? Come on. Are you serious right now? Yes. Kind of. You're funny. I like you don't get me wrong. And I think you're very attractive. But like I don't I know you like that, shouldn't we just talk first? Fine. Let's talk. What do you want to talk about? What do you want to talk about? Jesus. As I was reading. (Door slam) What was that? I don't know. Is your roommate home? I don't think so. Stop being so paranoid. Sit down. You're not scared? Don't be so scary. So you're not scared, at all? Why should I be? I have a strong, big man of God here to protect me. Wow. You are the beast, aren't you? What is that? What? This? Yo.... What's so funny? Hell no, bro! That better not be what I think it is! You wanna feel? Grab it. And how did that make you feel? Finding out Nicki had an erect penis? I felt sick. I felt disgusted. I was shocked. Darnell: Did you react in violence? No. Did she perform any sex acts on you? Such as such as oral copulation. Absolutely not. We just kissed and she grabbed my genitalia a couple times. But I never allowed her or forced her to perform any oral copulation. And what happened? You got a whole ass dick, bro! Oh, I can't! You should've seen your face. But don't worry. I'm undergoing treatment for my gender transition now. I don't give a fuck! You totally violated me. I ain't with that gay shit. Who says you are? How can you be gay when I'm a woman? You're not a woman at all! Yes I am. Shit, the hell you are! Look, I don't have nothing against you, gays or trannies. What ever letter of the alphabet you claiming. But you're foul for that. You should at least warned me. Warn you for what? You should be a little more open minded. I'm still a woman. Open minded? Bitch, you know what? I'm out of here. I'm out of here. Ooh. You're gay! World Galaxy Star is gonna love this gay shit. Oh Michael, you are gay! I'm telling everybody. Yep, I'm telling everybody that you are gay as fuck, homie. Homo. Man, erase that. You don't have no right to record me. Yes, I do, you're in my house. I'm recording for my protection. Erase it. Pay me 25 grand for my lost scholarship. Then, I'll erase it. If you don't, I'll expose you for being gay. And how did that make you feel? Oh, I was angry. Josh set me up. He had a vendetta against me. So I took his phone and destroyed it. And why did you destroy his phone? Because everyone uses the internet nowadays, not for knowledge, but to embarrass, humiliate, and degrade people online. I did not want to be on the internet. I didn't want Josh to accuse me as a gay, to the world. And why don't you want to be a gay to the world? I'm a Christian. And plus people believe anything that's posted on online. So, how were you able take Mr. Stevens' phone from him? I had no intentions of taking his phone nor breaking it, but he kept on pointing it at my face, screaming Galaxy Star, Galaxy Star. I'm a post this everywhere. All the gay websites. Gay for the stay, Reach arounds, all of them! If you don't pay back my tuition. Oh, yeah? Give me that got damn phone! Fuck your phone. Look Nicki, we're cool and all but I'm not gay. Sorry if I offended you. But I'm not gay. God Bless you, hope the best for you But I gotta go. Motherfucker. Break my phone. Guys, stop! Chill man, get off me. Look man, I don't make me have to hurt you. Stop being so damn stupid. Ok man you win, just let me up. Fuck dude, chill out. If I let your stupid ass up, you gonna let me leave in peace? Yeah bro, just get off me. Alright I'm leaving, I don't want no more trouble. Hey, I'm gonna fucking kill you! (Gun shots) And that's when I ran across Terry Lawson's yard for cover. I was running home, but I saw a police officer, I wanted to report what happened but I was arrested instead. No further questions, Your Honor. Counsel. Michael, why do they call you Michael The Beast Robinson? Because I'm a beast on the mats. Do you mind if I call you Michael The Beast Robinson? You've been calling me that. Do they call you The Beast because of your violent behavior? Objection, Your Honor. She's calling him a beast in reference to an animal. Your Honor, that's his given nickname. Overruled. I'm not violent. I competed in mixed martial arts tournaments so I'm a beast on the mats. Is it normal for pastors to drink alcohol? A little Jesus Juice, is that what you call it? It was lack of moral judgement on my part. How many drinks did you and Ms. Wise have together that night? I don't know. Roughly, how many drinks did you think you had together? A couple of drinks at the bar. And were you drunk? Not really, I still had my wits about me. Looks like you were having fun. I was. Was it fun when Ms. Wise was performing fellatio on you? No, she never did that. You do realize you're under oath. I'm not lying about that. We just kissed. She grabbed my manhood a couple times, that's it. What's this manhood you speak of? She grabbed my private parts. And you let her? Yes, because I thought he was a woman. Do pastors always let people grab private parts on first dates? No. But you let Nicki? Again, I thought Nicki was a she, not a he. And yet, some how miraculously, your semen ended up in her mouth. Maybe she may have put her fingers in her mouth after grabbing my private parts. I find that very hard to believe Mr. Robinson. You claim to be a Christian, right? I am a Christian. If you were any kind of moral Christian, you would abstain from any immoral behavior. I never said I was Jesus. Oh, but aren't you called street Jesus as well. Look, I made a mistake. My judgment was impaired. How do you feel about gays, lesbians, transgenders? I have no problems with them. I love gays. I love everybody. In John 15:12: My command is this: Love each other as I have loved you. First Corinthians 13:13: And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love. Ever use the word faggot? No, not since high school. So, you haven't used that word in the last few years? No, I haven't. Your Honor, if I can have a couple of seconds? Granted. Your Honor, I would like to submit newly discovered evidence. Darnell: Objection, Your Honor! Evidence should not be admitted until Counsel has sufficient time to examine, prepare, and refute the said to be evidence. Your Honor, this evidence will refute Mr. Robinson's claims. Overruled. Admission of evidence granted. Is that you? Yes that's me. You fouled me you faggot ass motherfucker! You a bitch. You a punk ass bitch, you a bitch ass nigga. You said you haven't used that word, Mr. Robinson? That don't count. That guy wasn't even gay, it was not directed to gay people. Is that your excuse? It's not an excuse. These words can easily fly when someone is upset. But it was not directed towards gays or transgenders. Are you so easily upset, that you burst into an uncontrollable rage? No, I have self control. You admit that you destroyed Mr. Stevens' phone because you didn't want to be labeled as gay, because everybody believes everything posted online, correct? Yes. You claim Mr. Stevens tried to extort you, is that correct? Yes! Are we to believe that the only piece of evidence, that would exonerate and vindicate Mr. Robinson where Mr. Stevens says on video, that he's extorting him for $25,000, you destroyed it because you didn't want to labeled as gay online? Yes. The internet is forever. I didn't want Josh to tarnish my name. It's a little too late for that, Mr. Robinson. You know what I think can easily fly, Mr. Robinson? Your lies. The evidence shows that Nicki performed oral copulation on you, And you enjoyed it. And it slightly bothered you that she was transgender, because you're a conflicted, self loathing, in the closet gay! Objection, Your Honor! Counsel's statements are inflammatory and accusatory. Overruled. But let's just say that you didn't know Ms. Wise was transgender. After she performed fellatio on you. She never did that. Mr. Robinson, she reveals to you that she is in fact trans. And that enrages you, that humiliates you, that a transgender, a man pretending to be a woman, sexually assaulted you, took your manhood! Without you even knowing until after the fact. And it enraged you even more that Mr. Stevens was a witness and he was recording the whole thing. And you know what I would do if that was me as a heterosexual man? I'd beat the crap out of Ms. Wise and Mr. Stevens. I'd smash their heads in with a hammer. I'd try to kill all witnesses. A big, black, tough man like you can't be manhandled by no ladyboy! No way! How could you let that happen? But you didn't dare fight for your manhood because you're too much of a bitch ass nigga, aren't you? Nicki's got bigger balls than you do. Objection! Your Honor, Counsel's statements were way out of line. She just insulted my client. I request she be held in contempt. Order, order. Calm yourself, Counsel. I will not tolerate your fractious behavior. I'm sorry, Your Honor. You tried to beat Ms. Wise to death, you hated her for who she is but loved her head-game, didn't you? They are insinuating, argumentative, and provoking. You damn right, I beat their ass. That's what they deserve for setting me up. And I'll beat his again, both them dudes. But I didn't try to kill anybody. No further questions. Judge: Counsel, I find you in contempt of court. Serious sanctions will be rendered. Court will be adjourned until the following Monday. Mr. Robinson, you may step down. Jury, you're excused, have a good weekend. And Bailiff take Heather Stone into custody. Yes sir, Your Honor. Ms. Stone, right this way. Put your hands behind your back. (Handcuffs clicking) Right this way. (Patriotic music) Wow, I don't think I've ever seen an attorney be taken into custody before. But I believe the prosecution has helped the State. Mrs. Stone used a combative tactic to get Mr. Robinson confess. Mrs. Stone hurt the State. She lost my trust and I'm sure the Jurors. Her statements were racially charged and racist. Good she was arrested. She should be disbarred. Never to practice again. Now plead your case for guilt or innocence. First, let me say this, regardless of a guilty or not guilty verdict. Do not let the outcome of this case split this country apart even further. Cause right now we are embattled with arguments that is tearing this country apart. In terms of racism, discriminations, homophobia, xenophobia, religious- phobia, political divide. We can't let this lead us down a path to instability and incivility. We are a nation built on love, acceptance, and tolerance. Having said that, I believe the Jury will find Michael The Beast Robinson guilty. There's too much evidence stacked against him. I think theprosecution did a fine job of proving their case. I definitely believe the jury will find this young brother, not guilty. The proof is in the pudding. And Defense Attorney, Darnell Williams, a Black man. Did all he could and displayed, beyond a reasonable doubt, that this young brother did nothing wrong. Right this way. Right over here. Stop. Don't move. (Handcuffs clicking) Your Honor, she's all yours. Judge: Counsel. Your Closing Arguments. First, I would like to apologize to the Jury, the Court and Mr. Robinson. I was overly passionate in my arguments. It was out of line, uncharacteristic, demeaning, and insulting to many of you, and the black community. A lawyer's conduct should reflect on the legal profession and inspire the confidence, trust and respect of clients and of the community. I hope you all can find it in your heart to forgive me. Having said that, I'm not here to be politically correct and coddle feelings. I'm not here to play nice. I'm here to lock-up people in cages who behave like animals. That's my job. Imagine if that was your child being attacked and brutalized for who they are. Does a person deserve to be beaten near death because of their views or sexual orientation? If you say yes, you're part of the problem, and will one day be faced before me. Mr. Robinson destroyed the only piece of evidence that could've potentially exonerated him. If he hadn't there'd be no trial. But he did destroy it. What was he hiding? He was hiding his violent and perverted actions. Michael The Beast Robinson knew the whole time Nicki was transgender. And after getting what he wanted he felt guilt, self- loathing. And he decides to beat Ms. Wise and Mr. Stevens savagely. Prank or no prank, there is no excuse for the violent attacks on defenseless, innocent people. He pretends to be a Christian. Any God loving, God fearing Christian knows that if you have a problem with an individual and their views it's between you and God. No one deserves to be violently attacked for their beliefs their views, their sexual orientation. I feel I am doing the Lord's work by locking up criminals. Let's increase the peace and lockup The Beast. He acted out in rage, and must be put in a cage. The evidence demands a verdict. A guilty verdict. Thank you. Counsel. The Lord's work done by a prosecutor? By knowingly locking up innocent people is pervasive and unGodly. is pervasive and unGodly. The State did not produce any proof that Mr. Robinson intentionally tried to hurt or murder Ms. Wise or Mr. Stevens. Instead they relied on contradicting stories. One who alleges she cannot even remember certain key details. We do agree that Mr.Robinson destroyed his cellphone, but it wasn't because he was trying to hide anything. It's was to prevent the vicious spread of rumors amongst the internet. Smeared and labeled as a gay man. There was a fight where Mr. Stevens was savagely beaten and Ms. Wise hurt in the melee. And now, Mr. Robinson sits before you, charged with crimes he may not escape. Ladies and gentleman, Mr. Robinson is not the defendant he is the victim of several crimes against humanity. A prank orchestrated by Mr. Stevens to humiliate, retaliate and extort Mr. Robinson. Payback for snitching. Perhaps Ms. Wise had no idea she was sexually assaulting a heterosexual Christian man. I have no doubt Ms. Wise believes she is a woman. We're not disputing that. Whimpers. But biologically, Ms. Wise will never give birth to a child. That is what makes a woman a woman. Womb-man. A man with a womb. And that is what Mr. Robinson expected and wanted when getting intimate with Ms. Wise. But what he got instead was a biological man disguised as a woman in women features. This not what Mr. Robinson wanted. As beautiful as Ms. Wise may be. It's not what Mr. Robinson wanted or expected. We do believe in gender self determination. That is an American right! To self define our gender identity and expression while being free of discrimination and violence. It is the evil assumption that all gays, transgenders are immoral, or mentally ill. It's an assumption that me and Mr. Robinson strongly disagree with. Now what Mr. Robinson had to do was defend himself from extortion, sexual assault, his words, his life, his morals, his Christian beliefs. From not one but two people. Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Robinson is not the guilty one here, but one of these two are, if not both plaintiffs. I am confident that you will reevaluate the evidence, and come to a decision of not guilty. and restore this man's dignity in the name of our Father free this man. Free this man! Let him go. Welcome back. Let's get right to it. Guilty or not? What does this case mean to you? Quentarius, start. This case is not about attempted murder, not about a hate crime, any of that. This case is about a sexual assault, racial attack, gender fraud and extortion. The young brother should've never been the defendant. The Jury, Black, White, progressive, non-progressive will find Michael Robinson, not guilty. Tori. This case to me is about building a more tolerable, understanding society. I've been preaching love and tolerance. What is not tolerated in a new progressive, society is violence, injustice and discrimination The kind of preening society we reach for and attain to, that draws the ire of people who want us back in the Stone Age. We have no room for you bigots and haters in a new, progressive society. Jurors will find Mr. Robinson guilty. Let the record reflect that we have all been rejoined by all members of the jury. Thank you ladies and gentlemen. Bailiff, will you please hand the sealed verdict to the foreperson juror number 1? Alright foreperson, will you please open the envelope and check to see if any alterations or tampering have been made. Alright, ladies and gentlemen and jurors, I'm gonna ask that you listen carefully to the verdict as it is read. And I would caution the audience of any disruption of these readings, the bailiff will have the obligation to remove any persons disrupting these proceedings. Mr. Robinson, will you please stand and face the jury. Alright madam foreperson, the floor is yours. We the Jury in the above titled action find the defendant, Michael Robinson, case number G8YXYZ Guilty. Of a crime of attempted murder. A violation of penal code 664. Mr. Robinson, put your hands behind your back. Whoa, give him a minute, man. Stand down Counsel. Just give him a minute! Counsel, stand down! Michael, this isn't the end, bro. We are gonna fight this. Darnell: Michael, we're gonna get you out. We're gonna prove you innocent. Okay? Go this way. Knew it. Reporters yelling. We will be filing an appeal. No further questions at this time. I said no fucking further questions at this time! Would you date a gay person? Darnell, are you white or black? Can't we all get along?
