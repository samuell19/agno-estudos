No trauma, no internal injury No intracerebral hematoma Maybe she just fell from her bike wearing thick clothes without hitting the ground head first She's pretty lucky But now there's a problem And it's not from the accident She has a cyst in her brain In other words, brain tumor It looks several years old But not until now is it identified Thus far it's just a small cyst So she won't feeling anything Good thing that it's identified now If we do something, there could be some treatment If left untreated she could only have six or seven years to go I really don't know I should thank you or scold you How could this happen? I'm sorry This is the number of the brain director downstairs My sister-in-law often comes the see him so we know him well Perhaps he could help you I'll phone him too And number under that is mine If there's any problem you can call me How come you're here? Where's my sister? I work as an accidental injury assessor for an insurance company You know, some people has bought insurance for years but nothing has ever gone wrong on them For example, a man started to buy insurance 7 years ago so he has a seven-year policy now So long as nothing bad befalls him recently His policy will remain invisible to anybody And now I can work it out to change the name of his policy into your daughter's In this way, when you present a claim to the company you'll be able to get the compensation I need all your materials Yours, your daughter's, and her mother's Your id card number Address and such Your signature. Your daughter's thumbprint But, bear in mind you will never let anyone know we've been in contact Why should you help us? I thought it was all over But when I went to repair my car yesterday I found her mouth-organ left inside It made me think about the whole thing all over again I wondered why I was always careful in driving But it was just inexplicable yesterday that I hit your daughter Maybe your daughter isn't fated to die yet Without this accident, she wouldn't have had the body check and have found her disease out She would possibly die of a seizure years later but now she's got a chance This is the significance of the accident But, my second thought is that such significance is nothing if you're unable to cure her But I hope this incident should be significant especially it's me who found out the truth So I have to finish the job Yeah, it's what I think It's from Xiao Feng They're too heavy Easy to mend? No problem Go have a rest What is it? Let me make you some tea I better leave it with you, just in case you need it I've explained to them about your change of job I don't have to change my job It's not bad Your workplace is too noisy and your health is not good I don't need to change, really It's unnecessary, anyway Why? Because I'm going to die You need to have faith in the treatment As long as you can insist on taking medicine Why do you care about me? What? You heard it Because you're Xiao Feng's sister We are family What's with you? Don't forget we're having dinner tomorrow Hello? Thanks Alright, don't reproach yourself It's not your fault You were a kid at that time You couldn't take the responsibility I fully understand your feeling Now, so long as she takes medicine regularly Her disease will be gradually cured I'm here with you. Let's figure it out together How is her job? I've talked to several friends of mine But what I think matters most for her now isn't the job issue I think she should have a boyfriend or something I'm sorry. I've already had a date It's just I forgot that I'm serious. I just realized that I forgot it You don't believe me, do you? I'll see you some other time Here, sit here with me What are you chatting about? You look cheerful Well. Just small talks You had a haircut? No. Not once these months Well. Waiter, serve the dishes please So what's this dinner about? What is that printing for? No big deal Let's talk about you Why don't you want to go home? I parked my motorcycle walked into the building and push the lift's button Sister and her husband had dinner with me tonight Sister is pregnant The lift was on the 20th floor I watched it go down and open its door I just kept watching that I've been like this many times I just keep watching that Why do we always beat about the bush? What? Why can't we come straight to the point? I only got to know you this afternoon but I'm here to see you this evening You should be clear why I'm not going home It's because I'm lonely It's because I'm expecting you You know the answer but you keep asking so I don't care about what you've printed either but I have to ask that way It seems our talk can't continue if not so Why always beat about the bush? I don't want to go home I feel so lonely I have nowhere to go These are my problems I have other problems too I believe you have many problems too Your wrist is always bandaged You don't even turn a light on when you're home These are all your problems I need someone's company I need comfort I need to pour out It's too late I don't have time I don't want to say that bullshit anymore I don't have time We're totally strange to each other But, bypassing these words we can still comfort each other This afternoon I was very annoyed because you kept me from leaving work I was standing there awaiting you watching you come in I felt quite comfy I don't know why I just felt very comfy I think you're quite strange You're different from others Maybe the man I keep in touch most often and the man that cares about me most is my brother-in-law You're about his age So I find you're so friendly I still don't know why I only feel attracted by you I want to see you and talk with you When I was at dinner it was noisy around but I was absent-minded. Calm and peaceful I was thinking of you What are you laughing at? What's so funny? Tell me about you Me? Like what? Your wrist I was tired of living What the? The door is broken Try going through it Oh, how could it be? It's strange Whatever. I'll fix it tomorrow What's wrong? I hardly recognize him How about you? Can you remember? I don't know. That's a long time ago Perhaps I can remember people more lately And you? What? Primary schoolmate I'm not sure I can Not so impressed about that period of time So, if you run into someone just like me, in the street will you recognize it? Who will I run into? Primary schoolmate I won't Why? My primary school isn't here Where then? In a small town in the north that you don't know When are you leaving? A few days later He Wei What time is the flight? 10 o'clock Let me see you off Aren't you at work then? I can go by myself You got your medicine along? It's run out What? What to do? What to do? Go get some from Dr. Wang tomorrow Don't forget that Have some soup Pass that to me The book shelf is broken again I'll come take care of it another day Xiao Ke What are you up to? Xiao Ke Xiao Ke, what are you doing? Why? Why do you tie me up? Release me What on earth do you want? Why didn't you give me the medicine? The medicine You've got my medicine from the hospital but why didn't you give it to me? You didn't come last time She insists all the time I think she's quite clear about her disease so I've told her Apparently she didn't tell you Xiao Ke's medicine Did he come alone to you? Yeah He came alone. Your sister didn't I mean did he abruptly come without any appointment with you? I called him. I couldn't find you I went to the hospital and learned your disease I don't know how I should tell Xiao Feng I'm quite confused I kept pondering about it all the day I don't know how I should face you either I forgot to bring your medicine. I'm sorry You know that I'll die sooner without taking medicine You said you forgot? I forgot, really I'm so confused Confused? It's not that you just learned my disease today Xiao Ke, it's too complex to be put into words Your sister is always worried about your disease We try to work it out together We want you to be treated We want you to be cured Now I suddenly learned that your disease is incurable and you'll die anyway Why am I not confused? I'm always worried about you I care about you. I care about the two of you I haven't passed you the medicine so that's why you tied me up this way? You don't really know what I'm up to, do you? How should I know what you're up to? What are you up to? I'll meet you later What's with you? Why can't you tell? It's been so many days You can resort to your sister if there's any problem My sister? She is the biggest problem Go back I'll meet you later I'm going up there with you You could only make things more complicated Only I can handle it We can think of a safe way I am that safe way Do you know why? Do you know why I'm the only one that can handle it and why I even keep away from my sister on purpose? Because I'm ill and no much time is left for me This alarm clock on my wrist always reminds me of my doom I will be all right No one can hurt me No one can do harm to me Xiao Ke Leave my business alone What's the relationship between us? Have you lied to me before? Have you ever killed? Have you killed my parents? Untie me first Answer my question No kidding Nobody is kidding Xiao Ke Untie me first, I have to go to the bathroom Do you recognize them? Yes Of course I know about them But what does it have to do with me? Why do you tie me up? You recognized them in such an instant You have met them How could I have met them? Why couldn't you? Release me, Xiao Ke I must pay a call real soon What is so weird if you've met them? Why couldn't you have met them? Because they're dead They're dead before I knew Xiao Feng Really? How did you know that? That's what Xiao Feng told me What else has she told you? #NAME? What else has she told you? When you were little they were killed by others Did you do it? Are you crazy, Xiao Ke? What makes you say such words? It can't be wrong It's you It's you who did t All your reactions prove that you have some problem What problem do I have? Certainly I haven't met them before but at least I should know them, shouldn't I? There are so many photos in the house Theirs. Yours What if I recognize them? What if I recognize your parents in the photo? What's my fault? Untie me now I'll answer your questions after I go to the toilet okay? Xiao Ke What's wrong? Who is she? My ex-wife Why? The frame looks great. Where did you buy it? I didn't buy it. Someone gave it to me Who gave you this? A friend of mine, when I was young He even gave me a watch But I couldn't find it anymore It's been a long time What's wrong? Yeah It seems there was a watch What do you mean? I got confused I… I don't know whether I should tell you this but this frame is from my family There's a character 'Xiao' behind I can confirm it's from my family When I was small something terrible happened in my family On the same day, two things were lost One was this frame the other was the watch What's your friend's name? His name is He Wei My brother-in-law is He Wei Who is it? Oh? Who is it and what did he say to you? How can you believe a stranger rather than me? Stranger Which stranger? How should I know? You said it It's right that you said you're more convinced of what you heard But how do you know that's a stranger? You already knew who it is or you have met him before When you see him there perhaps you'll recognize him right away Perhaps you won't recognize at all because it's been so long But it doesn't matter You asserted that he is He Wei Tell him who you are and see his reaction He Wei Are you He Wei? I'm Lin Mu, you don't recognize me, do you? If he denies he's He Wei No then he has some problem I'm not your classmate but it's weird I'm really called He Wei You are He Wei. I recognize you No… You're mistaken I am He Wei But I'm not your classmate I'm not a native I didn't go to primary school here I've been here only since I graduated from college I really don't know anything about this frame I've never seen it before I don't know what it has to do with your parents' photo I don't know what it has to do with me or where my primary school is either It has a lot to do, of course If not, why did you lie? Where is your primary school? Why don't you tell me the truth from the very beginning? All that I said is truth I've told you that already In a small town in the north Just because you tell no truth since the very beginning I'm much more in doubt What do you doubt? You doubt I'm involved in your parents' matter? Where have you got this imagination? Xiao Ke, do you remember that we're a family? Do you remember that? Don't you think it's ridiculous...? What do you want? I'm shouting for help Let me piss first I'm shouting. You… What the heck are you doing? Let me go Do you hear me? Release me Do you hear me? What the heck are you doing? What are you doing? Hello You can file an investigation, Xiao Ke I didn't lie to you I don't need to hold back where my primary school is I can understand how you suffer from what happened to your parents You're not in good health But, look what you've done You hit me You strung me up and interrogated me But, do you remember that I'm the one who goes to hospital with you? I'm as worried about your disease as your sister We're a family Anyone else can treat you, but I won't Think it over Are you doing the right thing? But, it doesn't matter I can forgive you because you're still a child And your sister she's already pregnant We're a family, you remember that? Who are you? He Wei Who on earth are you? How can you say such words even now? Huh? Xiao Ke You're really a hair-splitter Why do you insist I am the one who lies? Tell me Who? Who told you all this? Why isn't it him that lies? Why must it be me? You really didn't lie to me? You really didn't kill? You really didn't kill my parents? I'm sorry He Wei I think I've already done my very best From this moment on, you must pay real attention Xiao Ke, Xiao Ke. I can't make it I'm about to pee soon Let me go to the bathroom Have you killed anyone? Come on. Come on. I can't do it. Let me pee Have you ever killed anyone? Oh, please Let me piss now, okay? Please Come on. Let me piss Piss. Piss. I want to piss Do you want to kill me? Let me piss, you nuts Do you want to kill me? Let me piss, damn it You still refuse to tell the truth, don't you? Xiao Ke Look at me Look what you've done to me I'm now with no dignity left at all I've never had such humiliation before Why have things become of the two of us like this? Xiao Ke, you're mistaken About your parents, and your own disease You're oversensitive But I don't blame you You think it over yourself from beginning to end You're really mistaken Your sister loves you so much We all love you so much We discuss about you all the time Our hearts are clutched by you We let you live in the best house We tried to change your job and get you a boyfriend I really hope you live a better life Xiao Ke I don't blame you, honestly Let's get it over now, okay? Let bygones be bygones Your sister is about to be back Let's not mess up anything, okay? Xiao Ke What are you thinking about? Why don't you speak? I beg you Please Please don't mess everything up, okay? Okay? You just asked me what's on my mind I'm now telling you what's on my mind I'm still wondering who on earth you are He Wei You're really scary When I look at your face I feel you look so hateful I liked you in the past Probably it's not just 'like' Because of you I admire and even envy Xiao Feng Just now I recalled what you looked like the look you touched your heart by hand make me sick I'm better than who I was I've learned to tell apart I've met a person what you call a 'stranger' He has a stiff face with hands in his pockets He never says bullshits And what else do I think of? I also think of my sister She's so poor She knew a bad person like you Fortunately she's on a trip otherwise I don't know how to face you Before she's back you and I must go to die I can't face her any longer I can't imagine how she should face you in future So you must die Look at me, He Wei Listen up, you motherfucker You lunatic You smug lunatic You're mistaken You're fucking mistaken You insulted me this way I definitely want to kill you But I won't I don't kill Never and ever I can't forgive you anymore You should understand me You must understand me If I can't take care of you like I did before, worrying about your life, you have to understand me I can't forgive you I can only forget at most For the sake of Xiao Feng, I can forget Now I'm returning home Give yourself up I'll kill you He Wei Have you killed anybody? Yes, I have I've killed two They really are your parents Speaking it out feels so good I deliberately keep you from the medicine Because I know you're suspecting me I knew it earlier I knew it when you asked me about primary schoolmate I live alertly than anyone I live in agony over the 20 years I've never had a good sleep I even fall asleep when they're washing my car, you know? In the restaurant that day your watch rang I heard that That's why I didn't give you medicine on purpose I'm hesitating just thinking that if you're dying sooner or later Dying sooner could be good for everyone Now what else do you want to know? I've prepared all the materials Don't worry. There's not a problem with this document In accordance with the time written there you first pay normally for months Don't hurry to claim the insurance Pay normally for months The more you pay, the better Retrieve it only when you run out of money and you really need some, do you understand? All right. It's settled then Thank you Don't thank me Do not thank me. Never Get out of the car If… If your daughter can survive this I hope she'll have a favorable life Close the door Good-bye Why did I do that? You mean why I killed your parents? How shall I explain it to you? I wasn't stealing things then The watch happened to be on the desk, so I took it randomly But I wasn't stealing things I'm not a light-fingered man I've had my ideal since I was little I've been very brave and self-disciplined After that, I always feel ashamed for this theft I think it impairs my characters I've taken it to heart So I gave them to others Except that watch and this silver photo frame How should I explain to you? It's a power of hatred I hate you all very much! Your house is too big There's a courtyard too with plants and flowers, and a big iron gate Your dad wore a watch every day Your mom applied makeup, and wore pajamas too That night Your house's iron gate was shattered I walked in your courtyard when I passed by The plants were uprooted Our men did it that afternoon We hit them and let them kneel on broken glass I had an urge to see how they were then Your father seemed to recognize me then He saw me in a sweat, so he asked me to drink some water as if nothing ever happened in the afternoon I went so mad Your mom is asleep So quietly She was still in those pajamas I gave her another cut without a second thought And I added a cut for each person when I was about to leave How old were you then? 13 years old, still in primary school Did you know who she was when you knew my sister? Of course I know If not, why did I marry her? Your sister always wore clean and neat clothes then She was quite cocky with her nose in the air when she walked She deeply hurt me I thought I must get even with her Now she serves me every day, and even has my baby Do you understand? It's the power of hatred This power is inborn and strong But I don't think I'm a victim Now everyone says so as if it's an objective and humane statement For every evildoer, as what they've done is revealed they'd say they're the victims themselves However, even in those days not everyone can choose to kill others Some would rather get killed by others without being able to choose to kill others as they were so kind But it was not a big deal at all to me at that point What was killing? I'm a dreamer, you got me? Perhaps you think I'm evil-minded ugly, brutal, in lack of education But I have dreams I'm not a vulgar person, without any thought I want to change the world It's just I was born in the wrong years You got that? I live in the wrong years But I'm scared too I'm really scared I often have nightmares I feel ashamed for what I've done For some time I even thought that it might be as good if someone would discover all this At least my agony would no longer exist But now all the pains are over At least I don't have to be scared anymore Not scared of you, or your sister I don't have to care what you care I don't have to worry whether you doubt me Xiao Feng changed me Really Our life was peaceful. She changed me I remember, before I got married Once she took me to extract a tooth That was a really sultry afternoon I still remember that hospital and that doctor as well He extracted my tooth while smoking I was lying there, unable to move with my mouth open seeing the ashes falling into my mouth My mouth was widely open without eyes goggling I was extremely in panic then I saw your sister She was standing there Seeing her, I felt as if I saw a savior From then on, I've been completely devoted to her I was changed by her I began to find being kind is good I began to find having straight teeth is good I'm neither repenting nor atoning for my sin I just feel that being kind is good I began to love what I hated before You got it? When I lie in bed every night I really want to have a talk with the younger myself My life with your sister is so peaceful We're happy. I'm changed already I'm vulgarized now But I'm fond of all this I'm obsessed with all the vulgarized things I'm reliant on all the vulgarized things But now you've destroyed all this You've destroyed everything Are you content? Do you feel content as you imagine? Content? Not at all But it fully extricated me It's really strange The pain is over Formerly, I thought I was the poorest guy You killed my parents and you just even raped me But I suddenly find out perhaps raping is no big deal I'm going to die soon It doesn't matter if I have one more painful memory But, for you I'm not obsessed that you must die anymore You have distorted thought that I don't agree But I'm willing to try to understand You killed my parents Over the years the pain has faded out You said you want to have a talk with the younger yourself I take it as the most genuine memory For me maybe this is enough already Your story of tooth extracting moved me This is what you called attachment dependence and your change They are not vulgarized Believe me The problem lies in you I'm dying soon However, looking at myself I think I'm healthier than you He Wei Go away
