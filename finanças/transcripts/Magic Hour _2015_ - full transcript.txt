Prambors Radio is on the air and you're still with Desta and... Gina in the morning! Good Morning! We have a special song for lovebirds out there. - Play it. - Here we go. You must reach Ma Petit Cafe an hour from now. Why? No questions, just listen. Once you arrive, tell the waitress your name is Gwenny... ... and just sit the table reserved under my name. You will meet a guy there and... - ... and I need you to observe him. - But... Who's your best friend in the entire world? You are. - And who's my best friend? - I am. What are you still doing here? What time is it? You're late for a delivery. Get going! - Hello there. - Hi. What happened? You had an accident. You were hit by a car, but it's nothing serious. How do you feel? Dizzy? Nauseous? I think I have to leave now. Can I leave now? Sure, but you have to sign this statement letter from the police. Your medical charges will be borne by the driver who hit you. He's nice and handsome. You could press charges against him... ... but I think you shouldn't because he's so nice and cute. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Oh no! One more thing, do you know where my bike is? It's probably at the police station,... ... so you may want to head that way to see if it's there. If you can't go there now, you can get someone to do it for you. You must come back for a check-up if you... ... feel unwell as you may have a concussion. It's dangerous. Okay. This is a serious matter, so don't take it lightly. To Ma Petit Cafe. Please hurry. Where is that girl? How on earth did she end up in a hospital... ... when she should be delivering flowers? She'll be the death of me! Good afternoon, how may I help you? I'm meeting someone here and I need your help to find him. Why are you up stray to the hospital, instead of delivering flowers. Hospital employee called. He said you were there. In panic, I went to look for you there. With eyes wide open, searching at every corners. Give her a break, Mom. It was an accident. Auntie, about the damaged flowers... Why should discuss interest again do not need anymore. Now this is important... My poor ears! All day I've been listening to customers... ... complaining about undelivered flowers! Why do you have to insist on delivering flowers on that silly bike? You have to be extra careful when riding a bike! Told you to take the car a million times but you never listen! Come on, Mom. Raina's still in shock. Her wounds are still fresh and you're already scolding her. Oh, stop defending her! Eat! You. How's your meeting with Dimas? You've already met up with him, right? Do you like her? Pretty, right? Yes, Mom. She's pretty. What did you talk about? Quite a lot. You just met. Not much to talk about. I'm so happy. Really happy. So, when is your next date? Or it's better to get engage immediately? I'm so happy. Forget about phone calls. Just get engaged. Engaged? Gwenny! Why didn't you tell me that the guy you told me to meet... ... is the same one Aunt Flora is trying to set you up with? - I wouldn't have gone if I had known! - Shush! Don't let my mom hear you! I couldn't have gone to meet him myself. I don't want to be set up with someone I've only seen in photograph! That's why I sent you over there so you can... ... do some investigating on him beforehand. You get it now? Okay, the important thing is how and when you're going to meet him now. What? Me again? No way! You didn't even see him the first time. What's wrong? Nothing. Just a bit dizzy, that's all. Seriously? I think you'd better get a CT scan to make sure everything okay. I'm fine, really. It's normal to get dizzy after a fall, right? Okay. If you say so. What about you give Dimas a call to meet him tomorrow? Gwen, tomorrow? But I still have a lot to do, Gwen. This is the number Mom gave me yesterday. She thinks I have been having regular phone... ... conversations with him all this time. Why are you using my phone? Where's yours? In my room. You always do this to me. Why do you have to use my phone to call him? Of course. You're the one who's meeting him after all. It's connecting. Talk to him. He's not picking up. What? - Raina. - Gwen, let go! Whatever! See, it's crumpled now because of you. Oh, no. The tape recorder's gone! Gwen! Hi, Dimas. I'm Gwenny, the girl our mothers are trying to set you up with. Let's meet tomorrow. 7pm at Ma Petit Cafe? One hot caramel latte. Hey, Toby, My name is Lovely. I'm 16 years old. My phone number is... You'd better write it down before that piece of paper gets lost. What are you going? Just throw it away. They's just kids. Hi, I'm Lovely. 16 years old. - Give it back! - Who is she? No wonder you haven't called or texted me all week. - Raina, it's nobody. - Okay, fine. What's wrong with your forehead? Did you fall or something? It's nothing. Same thing happened to me yesterday and I had blood... ... pouring out my head. Did he ask me if I was okay? No. You look like Mick Jagger when you scowl like that. You have a big cut on your cheek. That's not a cut. That's probably a birthmark. I'm thirsty. Is your shift over yet? Not yet. I'll be done when camels can fly. Say something again and I will shove this in your mouth. Meddling others business. It's natural between boy and girl. - Let's go. - Let me, clock out first. Wait here. One cup of the usual. Put it on my bill. Hot green tea latte for Miss Raina. The silly girl who loves getting caught in the rain. - Tell me. - What? So you're still not over the "sunshine of your life", huh? Don't get cryptic if you really want to confide in me about your love life. Who's this "Sunshine"? You've never told me her name. I don't really care who "Sunshine" is, but it's a girl, right? - It's a boy. - Oh my god! Really? Of course it's a girl! It's a girl! It's not Brandon, is it? Or perhaps "Sunshine" is Anisa, the cashier? She's pretty and I think she has feelings for you. - Oh yeah? - Yup. I think I have feeling for you too. Not! - Come again? - I'm just kidding! Ouch. It hurts. My head hurts. - I'm so sorry. - No, it's okay. Oh, yes. You haven't told me how you ended up like this yet. Two days ago, I had an accident while riding my bike. Got hit by a car at the intersection over there. When did it happen? Saturday morning around 10? But you... Who's the driver of the car which hit you? Should I have introduced myself to him after I got hit? No, right? Okay. Let's change the subject. Tell me about your love life again. Welcome to Flora's Florist. How may I help you? I need to buy some flowers. What? I need to buy some flowers? Who are the flowers for? Your girlfriend or.... How much are they? 350 thousand rupiahs, please. I'll get your change in a second. Are the orders ready, Raina? Daydreaming at work! No wonder you got hit by that car yesterday! - You have to concentrate at work! - Yes, Aunt Flora. How are you going to deliver the flowers? Where's your bike? - Um... - What um? - The bike... - Yes, where is it? The bike is here! It's so strange. Suddenly the bike turns up at the shop and it's been fixed. Who could this good Samaritan be? Could be the same guy who hit you. - Huh? - Maybe he felt guilty. If that's the case, how did he find out my address then? There is a sign on your bike with Flora's Florist written on it. Isn't the address right underneath the name? The phone number too. That's right. No wonder he knew. What are you up to? Why are you smiling? I finally recorded the song. See? I knew you can do it. Congratulations! Congrats! Anisa? I'm so sorry! Are you going to give it to "Sunshine"? Just listen to it. Rain? What's wrong? I'm okay. I'm just dizzy. For Raina. Sorry for the accident. ♪ Other people may long for rainbows. ♪ ♪ But not me. ♪ ♪ Although I know the clouds are not dark ♪ ♪ I still wait for the rain ♪ ♪ Dark skies are nowhere to be seen ♪ ♪ But I keep on hoping ♪ My name is Raina, but I prefer to be called Rain. Why? Because I love the rain. The rain is a simple pleasure of mine. For me, the rain is beautiful. It's fun. I feel meaningful when I'm alone. No need for conversations or crowds. I can create my own happiness. I don't even have to wait for sleep in order to dream. Because I live in my imagination. I don't have to fall in love to feel love. I don't have to lose anyone to feel empty and sad. All I have to do is stare at the sunset. Like Sleeping Beauty in her deep slumber. Until the day when my true love finally arrives. As beautiful as the many magic hours I've spent on this pier. ♪ Please never stop ♪ ♪ Rain, 'cause I need you ♪ ♪ more than the rainbow ♪ Toby? Isn't that Toby's voice? Yes, it is. He wrote the song. Nice, right? - Wait, he wrote that song by himself? - Yup. Oh my god, you've been listening to the song... ... without realizing what it means? If only you knew what this song means, Rain. This song is for you. For you. Wake up, Rain! Toby wrote the song especially for you! He's been singing about the rain, which means you! He's only singing about the rain, not me. Who like rain and writes poetry about rain? Me. - What's your name? - Raina. - And people call you...? - Rain. - And Toby calls you...? - Rain. See? Told you so. I've brought you this pretty white dress... ... to wear for your meeting with Dimas. Okay. - Hurry, don't be late. - Fine. Pretty, right? Oh, yes. Don't forget to look in your drawer, okay? Okay. See you. Rain, why don't you come? Who's your best friend in the world? You, Gwen. Excuse me. Would you like to place your order? In a minute. Thank you. Yes, Rain? He's here! We've already talked about this, haven't we? You have to pretend to be me and the most important thing is... ... you have to find out as many things as possible about him. I don't think I can do this. I feel queasy all of a sudden. My hands are cold. I'm scared. Please? Besides, lying is wrong. Let me go home, okay? No more protesting. You have to do as I say, get it? She hung up! Gwenny? Hey, wait! Wait! Wait! - Are you all right? - I'm okay. Didn't you see the car coming towards you? She's heavy. Wake up. Are you okay? What am I doing in you car? Are you kidnapping me? Me? Kidnapping you? You passed out on the street just now. Was I supposed to leave you lying there? I was going to take you to a hospital. - No need. - Wait. Where are you going? - Home, of course. - Let met take you home. - No need. - I'll put the bike in the trunk. Don't bother. I can go home by myself. - You sure? - Yes. I just want to say something. I didn't mean to lie to you. I'm not Gwenny. Gwenny's my sister. I just want to find out... ... what kind of guy she's being set up with. You're a lucky guy, really. She's a catch. Thanks. Let me see. Let me see! Let me see! I don't get you. Are you a guy or a girl? Can't you man up and make a decision? You're a man! Have courage and pick one already! This concerns the emotions of a woman. Anisa. Look at her drooling over you every day. Then you string her along and play it cool. You shouldn't do that to her, the poor thing! Anisa, this is Toby. Isn't his hair nice? Like Tommy Page's. You heartless cad. If Anisa's work performance starts to slip,... ... I'm sticking your head in the coffee grinder! Flower delivery for Mr. Yasser. This is the receipt. Here you go. - Thank you. - You're welcome. You again? Wait up! Why are you following me? - Me? Following you? - Oh, just admit it. Don't flatter yourself. If that's the case, what are you doing here? Don't tell me it's merely a coincidence? Cat got your tongue? Tell me the truth. You're still mad at me for lying to you, right? - This girl is nuts. - Wait. - What, now? - You want to ask about Gwenny, right? Why is Gwenny so important to you? You pretend to be Gwenny and chase me all around town just so we can meet. Even a paid servant isn't as loyal as you are. Hey, watch your mouth! I consider Gwenny my best friend and we're sisters. That's why she's important to me! - Got that? - Really? So for Gwenny's sake, you'd come with me right now? No way! Why on earth would I do such a thing? I thought I was supposed to ask you about Gwenny? In fifth grade, there was this boy who stuck gum in Gwenny's hair. So I bite his hand 'til he bled. That's scary. How do I put it? It's like if someone were to hurt her, I would feel more pain. The person who loves Gwenny the most would be her mom. Yes, that's true but I'm the person who loves her the most after her mom. Okay. Raina was the cutest baby in the orphanage. She was so adorable! Those cubby cheeks! Oh, how everyone adored that girl. She can be exasperating at times, though. Can you believe she still loves getting soaked in the rain? How childish! Oh Flora. You still haven't changed. - I know you mean well. - Of course I do. But... You're too fussy. Too bitchy. Oh, please. How can someone as pretty as I am to be too bitchy? Have a drink. What do you think? Isn't Gwenny a perfect match for Dimas? That's why I'm here to see you today. I want to their engagement to happen sooner. - Let's take cover from the rain. - Why? I like the rain. I like dancing in the rain. You know what I'm talking about, right? Dance. Careful. Don't slip. You don't seem like yourself when you're among these books. How so? You seem like a little child among balloons and candy. I have a dream. I want to write a novel one day. I like Mario Puzo. He often writes about the Mafia. My favorite is The Godfather. There is a quote from the book which I love. Which one? "A man who doesn't spend time with his family can never be a real man." I'm flying! The most fun thing in the world for me is a swing. Since I was little,... ... I have always loved playing on a swing with my eyes closed... ... and imagine that I'm flying. Let's do it. One, two, three. Woo-hoo! Listen to me. Take off your earphones. - I need to talk to you. - Can't it wait? - It's about Dimas, Gwen. - What about him? Dimas is your guy. You're getting engaged to him soon, you know. Stop reminding me. Listen to me. You have to meet him for yourself. I have met him several times and I've gotten to know him. I'm sure if you get to know him, you'll fall in love with him. Enough. Let me listen to music in peace, will you? Please, Gwen. I'm serious. Gwenny! You're so annoying. I know I'm not supposed to have feelings for Dimas. But I... In your view, what is magic hour? The time when the sunset and the moon rise. The colour is beautiful. In simpler words, just like now. But for me... ... magic hour is the time when all the beauty and magic of the skies... ... are portrayed in front of our eyes. Great. And during this time,... ... we will forget our troubles and all we feel is gratitude to God. Prambors Radio is on the air and you're still with Desta and... Gina in the morning! - Feeling sleepy? - Yup! You have to keep your spirits up even when you're sleepy. My spirits are up because I'm in love! - Are you really in love, Gina? - Of course! We have a special song for you lovebirds out there. - Play it. - Here we go. It was then that... ... I finally experienced... the most beautiful magic hour I'd ever felt in my life. Words can't describe what I'm feeling. If only I could stop time just once. Could he really be my true love? I've learnt from Dimas one thing. Something more beautiful than falling in love. Knowing that love is the only one for ever. - Rain? - Yes? I can't see you for the next few days. Miss me already? Where are you going? Wrong question. The correct one is "what are you going to say?" - What do you mean? - Ask me, then. Okay. What are you going to say? I want to say... ... that I've already fallen in love with you even before I've met you. And now that I'm with you. I don't want to give you an ordinary love. What can be more beautiful than falling in love? To me, you are my one love. Forever. I want to stay like this with you. Even though I've never known my parents,... ... I believe I exist because of their love for each other. Love is one thing I believe in... ... without having to see it. Just like God. And you. You strengthen my belief that I exist because of love. What do you want even more than love? I want you to never leave me. Forever. I wish I had better news for you. But yesterday's test results show that... ... the cancer has spread across Dimas' body. Chemotherapy and drugs can only do so much. Are you saying... ... there is no hope left for Dimas? I'm not God, Cindy. Sometimes hope is the best medicine of all. I've seen hope do wonders for my patients. They have high hopes. Sometimes to miraculous recoveries. Whatever you can do to keep Dimas' hopes up, do it. Because that may be the key to his survival. Today is the fifth day without you. It feels weird, like something missing from the days of my life. Eventhough I still don't know why,... ... I'm grateful Gwenny didn't want to meet you that time. I believe that there are no such thing as mere coincidence. Hey. Hello, Flora's Florist. How may I help you? It's you. Where have you been? Tonight? What time? But I get decide the venue, okay? I miss you. So when are you coming back? I'm fine here. Oh, stop pretending that you care. Mom told me you called. Why are you so possessive all of a sudden? What's going on? Okay. Can't wait to see you. Bye. Dimas. - Did you give her a call? - Yes, I did. - And? She is coming back, right? - Yes, she is. Next week. Perfect - Can you get it, please? - Okay. Prospective daughter handsome so cute. Uh, wait. The nose. Is it real? Did you get a nose job? It's real? That's amazing! So cute! - Hi, Flora. - Your boy is so handsome! I'm going to pinch your cheeks! - Gwenny. - Evening, Auntie. Since they have grown quite close,... ... we can talk about the engagement date tonight. Splendid! I'm pinching his cheek one more time! Hey. For the first time ever, I disliked the rain. I just want Dimas to have a normal life. Which mother doesn't want her child to enjoy the last moments of... Hush! Don't say that. Remember! Doctors are not God. Dimas will get better, I'm sure of it. You don't have my number yet, right? I'll call your phone. - Okay, got it. - Save the number, okay? Sure. You don't use this number anymore? That's Raina's number. I had to borrow her phone that time because something was wrong with mine. Hey. You're soaked! Riding your bike in the rain again? What if you catch a cold? - What are you doing here so late? - Am I breaking the law or something? Toby, I'm in no mood to argue with you tonight. Are you saying that we're destined only to argue with each other? Why are you talking about destiny? Who did you meet? - Nobody. - Rain, don't lie to me, please. I really didn't meet anyone! You're lying again. I heard you are making plans to meet someone tonight. True. But he didn't show up. So you waited for him in the rain and he didn't show up? Tell me who he is and I'll beat him up. Stop it, Toby! Stop overreacting. Just go home. Rain, how would you feel if I tell you I love you? What? How would you feel if I tell you I love you? Say something. I think you'd better go home, Toby. I need to change otherwise I'll catch a cold in these wet clothes. Take care. Rain. Raina. Mission accomplished. Wake up! I finally met my Prince Charming. I finally met Dimas tonight. He's so nice. Cute too. Next week, Dimas and I will be getting engaged! Oh, I'm so happy! - Hi, Rain. - What are you doing here? You didn't reply to my texts last night. I'm not talking about last night. I'm talking about right now. What are you doing here? To see you, of course. I want to explain about last... Dimas! You can only do either one of two things here. One is to buy flowers. The other is to see Gwenny. Understand? - Since when are we discussing Gwenny? - Since the first time we met! The sole purpose of us meeting up... ... is to find out what kind of guy you are so I can report back to Gwenny. I don't care. Rain, I love you. And I'm running out of time. I want to marry you. Are you out of your mind? I'm not crazy. I'm going in right now to tell everyone everything. And I'm going to ask Aunt Flora for you hand in marriage. No! Don't you dare! - I don't really love you. - Liar! I don't! I really don't! You can hate me all you want,... ... but it won't change anything between us. Rain! Rain, I know you're lying. I know you love me. Let's meet up. - Hey. - Toby! Going to work? We're fated to bump into each other, aren't we? I don't know what to say. I know we have been friends for a long time. Now, I realize that I want us to be more than friends. Why do things have to change between us? Didn't we have a lot of fun as friends all this time? Is this your way of saying no to me? Are you in love with someone else? No. This has nothing to do with anyone else. This is between us. So what's the matter? Why can't you be my girlfriend? I don't get it. Why did God create mankind with hearts just so they can be broken? What are you talking about? Rain. Rain, I'm sorry but I can't beat around the bush. This is really how I feel. I can't hide it any longer. I love you. There are plenty of girls out there who want to be your girlfriend. I don't care about other girls! I only want you. Don't you understand? We've been friends for 6 years. We like each other don't we? Can't you increase that feeling just a little and go from like to love? What's the difference? Let me ask you this. Why are you so obsessed with us being in a relationship? Because I have a heart. Unlike you. Think! Why don't I want to be more than friends with you? Because I don't want to lose you! Imagine I'm your girlfriend. We're together for a year or two, then we keep arguing and break up. We lost each other. Is that what you want? I'm willing to take that risk! - As long as we're together. - In that case, let's just stay friends. I promise you will never ever lose me. Till death do us part. Because someone will break my heart one day... ... and I will need you to hug me when that happens. I will never leave you. Like a star that will never leave the sky. Where have you been? Say hi to my best friend, Auntie Cindy. She just returned from London. And this is Auntie Cindy's son. His name is Dimas. Gwenny's future husband. Soon to be your brother-in-law. Go on, introduce yourselves. This is my adopted daughter, Raina. Shake hands. - Dimas. - Raina. We are gathered here today to discuss Gwenny and Dimas' wedding date. We've collected brochures... ... on possible venues, bridal shops and catering services. Honeymoon packages too! - Want to take a look? - Hold on, Mom. I have to apologize. I can't go ahead with this marriage. What? Why? What do you mean by that? I'm in love with someone else, Mom. Why didn't you tell me? How embarrassing! Who is she? The girl I'm in love with is... ... Raina.. - This Raina? - Yes, I'm in love with her. Gwen, I... You traitor! Is this how you repay what my mother and I have given you all these years? I hate you! I have shared everything with you. Even my mother's love! If she hadn't picked you up from that orphanage,... ... you'd be begging in the streets now! Gwen, that's enough. This is none of your business. This is between Raina and me. It's not Raina's fault, Gwenny. Remember what you did the first time we were supposed to meet? You told Raina to meet me while pretending to be you. You told Raina to do that? Why? Gwen, there are no coincidences. I'm really grateful to you. Raina and I wouldn't have met each other if not for you. But you shouldn't have fallen in love with her! Did you forget who's your best friend in the whole world? You forget! You still love me, Rain! You, Gwen... I don't get you, Dimas. You were supposed to be with Gwenny. Not with Raina. I can't lie to myself, Mom. I don't understand it as well. I've never felt like this before I met Raina. Remember how I almost gave up on life? I didn't feel like I had a reason to go on living anymore. I even went along with your matchmaking plans. But ever since I met Raina,... ... it feels like I have a valid reason to live. Rain? Dimas? I can't see you. I'm right here. I can't see! Dimas, I can't see you! Gwen? Where is Raina? Get up! You're the one crossing the road! You made me hit Raina! - You're the one that hit her! - Stop it! - This is the reason you pursued me. - No. So you love me merely out of guilt? Out of pity? Raina, I pursued you because I had feeling for you. I love you. I don't need your pity! - I love you. - Go away! Go away! Can you see my condition now? I will never able to see your face again! - Go away!! - Let me hold her. There, there. Be strong, dear. I'll always be here for you, no matter what. My name is Raina. I still love the rain. I still love dancing in the rain. However, for the past 3 months,... ... I haven't been able to see how beautiful rainbows are. The beauty of my magic hour at the pier. - Let me help you. - No, thanks. Take care. But what hurts most... ... is not being able to see the face of the person... ... who showed me what love is. What's wrong, Gwen? They found an eye donor for you, Rain. You'll be able to see again. Gwen. Hi. How's Rain? - Do you want to see her? - No. Just give this to her, will you? For Raina? - Why don't you give it to her yourself? I'm heading to work, so I'll leave it with you. Can I call you tomorrow... ... to find out when the operation is scheduled for? Sure. Okay, then. See you around. I think your song is beautiful. What? I think the song you wrote is beautiful. I really like it. Thanks. For real? By the way, I'm preparing to record another one. You should listen to it sometime and let me know what you think. You'd be the very first person to hear it. - That's for Rain. - Oops. That's right. Sorry. Rain. I thought we'd never meet again. Don't worry, I'll always be here to make sure you're all right. Don't cry. You're someone's reason to smile, you know. I don't hate you. I know. I have to tell you something. Open your eyes. Can you see this? Look right. Gwen? You can see! Thank God! Dimas. Magic Hour: One Love for Eternity I never expected that... ... you'd be the one to make my dream of... ... publishing a novel become reality. What's wrong? Nothing. Every time I look at that those eyes gleaming,... ... it makes me glad to see you so happy. It's raining! Let's do what we usually do in the rain. Let's go home. You'll catch a cold. But you haven't forgotten what we like doing in the rain, right? No, but I don't want you catching a cold. Do you remember what you said to me once? I've said so many things to you. How am I supposed to remember them all? True, but this one is rather unforgettable. What's that? You said that there is something more beautiful than falling in love. Of course there is! Something more beautiful than falling in love is... Hope. Because hope keeps us alive. Am I right? What can be more beautiful than falling in love? To me, you are my one love. Forever. - You're not Dimas. - Rain? Who are you? - Rain? - You'd better go. Okay, I'm going. Take care. Wait. I remember that tap on my shoulder. I recognize your voice. You're the one who looked out for me when I crossed the road, right? You're not Dimas, but why do you look like him? Who are you? Where is Dimas? Dimas was my twin brother. We were born only minutes apart. He didn't realize he had brain cancer. When he was finally diagnosed, it was too late. I'm donating my corneas to Raina. But with one condition. I don't want Raina to find out just yet. Only until she's ready to face the truth about my condition. Dimas? Mom. If not for Raina,... I wouldn't have stayed alive this long. So I'm begging you. Please let me live on as a part of Raina's life. Dimas kept this from the day of the accident. And after hearing what's on the tape recorder,... ... he had nothing but deep admiration for you. If only I could see Dimas one last time. You have to see this. You will know everything. I came back here when Dimas' condition worsened... ... and he was living his last days. I followed and looked out for you. I recorded everything so Dimas could see you as well. Rain. If you're watching this, I'd be really happy. Because that would mean that you've regained your sight. It also means that we'd never watch the... ... magic hour on the pear together again. Please forgive me. I'm preparing a surprise for you. That novel on the magic hour that you've been dreaming about. You'd better read it. Typing it was really tiring, you know. How could this happen? Dimas had always looked healthy. He told me you bumped into each other at the hospital once. Oh my God. So he was at hospital not because he was following me,... ... but because he was getting his treatment? So when he disappeared for a few days, he was getting chemotherapy? Yes. We can stop this first if you want. No, I'm fine. You really look like him, even though you're two different people. Remember when he gave you a present at the hospital? Dimas, why are your hands so cold? What's this? You'll find out in time. Dimas was right. Perhaps this is what true love is. Rain, I know I'm not your first love. But I promise I will be your last.
