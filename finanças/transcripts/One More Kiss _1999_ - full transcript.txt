(tense music) (air whooshing) (wind rumbling) - [Sarah] They say the best tie to jump is about 5:00 p.m. when the wind is low and the traffic won's stop for anybody. (siren wailing) Too windy, and you'll be tossed around before being spat out mercilessly onto a neighboring roof. Too calm, and you'll drop like a stone, risking the lives of all those below. (solemn music) 70% of those who jump, don't even reach the ground. (birds squawking) (Charlotte laughing) (Sam sighs) - I'm getting too old for this. - How much did we take? - I don't know. Oh, and I've still got to clean the fridges. - I'll do the fridges, and you can sit here. - I mean, why can't people eat at home? - [Charlotte] Because we wouldn't make any money. (dramatic orchestral music) (printer whirring) (singing in foreign language) (loud knocking) - We're closed. No, we're closed. - Hello. - Sarah? What are you doing here? - Well, that's not much of a welcome, is it? - Is your father all right? - That's a matter of opinion. (both laughing) - Come here. - Am I missing something? - Charlotte, this is Sarah. Charlotte's my, my wife. Well, tell us about it. How was America? - [Sarah] A bit lonely, actually. - [Sam] Did the business work out? - [Sarah] Yup. - I knew it would. She was always good at everything. Didn't get married then? - [Sarah] No. - Well, I was a hard act to follow. (Charlotte laughs) So, how long you here for? - That depends. - Well, it's great to see you. Kinda reminds me of the good old days. - What was so good about them? - Oh, you know what it was like then, childhood things, no responsibilities. - I always think you remember things better than they really were. Anyway, what responsibilities? I hope you don't mean me. - I spent most of my childhood wishing I was old enough to leave. Now, I wish I'd stood back and enjoyed it. - [Sam] You sound as though you regret going. - How do we ever know if a decision is right? - If it makes you happy. - [Sarah] I don't know that you can just be happy, maybe you can have moments. - Aren't you happy? - No. But for the first time, I'm beginning to realize what happiness is. I'm beginning to realize what would have made me happy. Look, there isn't an easy way to say this. I'm dying, and I thought I could come back here and, well, you know. The medical term is brain stem carcinoma, cancer. - Isn't there some kind of treatment? - Do you think I'd be here if there was? I didn't mean it to sound like that. I meant, I wouldn't be announcing it like this. - Why are you announcing it? - [Sam] Charlotte! - It's okay. That's a fair question. Because I'd like to spend some time with your husband. - What kind of time? - The time I have left. (sullen music) - What would you do in my position? - Tell her to get stuffed. (fire crackling) Well, why does it have to be you? - No, don't you mean, why does it have to be her? Now, what happened to the kind, loving, thoughtful, charitable person I married? - She turned into a terrified of losing you, selfish, don't want you to see her at all person. - Okay. I won't see her if you really don't want me to. - I really don't want you to. - I love you, Charlotte, I always will. (door creaks) (sullen music) - Why didn't you wake me? - Because I know how annoying that would be. - When did you get here? - About five o'clock this morning. - Where have you been all day? - Frank, it's lovely to see you, but can we do this tomorrow? - You're tired, you should get some sleep. Mine isn't cooked. - You don't cook sushi, Frank. - I think I'll cook mine. It's disgusting. - [Sarah] Then give it to the dog. - Japanese, isn't it? - So? - I can't eat Japanese. - Why? - Have you any idea what they did to our boys in the war? I'd feel a hypocrite. Anyway, it tastes like rubber knickers. - Then don't eat it, you miserable git. You ought to hear yourself. Your bones ache in winter, your skin dries in summer, and what did you ever do about it? Nothing. God. You know, we get one chance, Frank, one, and we have to take it because if we don't, well, it might not always be there waiting for us. I'm dying, Frank. I'm going to die. I'm sorry. (sullen music) - Everybody, this is Frank. - [Group] Hello, Frank. - Um, feel free to tell us a little about yourself, Frank. - I like cricket, jazz. I don't like fish. I'm retired. - How long have you known? - Since they made me redundant. - She means, how long have you had cancer, idiot. - I don't have cancer. - I think you've stepped into the wrong group, dear. This one's for cancer sufferers. - Yeah, basket weaving's down the corridor. - Just 'cause I don't have cancer, doesn't mean to say I'm not a cancer sufferer. My daughter's got cancer. I came here to see what she should be doing about it. - So, you gonna see her? - [Sam] I don't know. - You must know. You must have made a decision of some sort. - It's not that easy. You know, you're making it sound like some kind of simple choice. - [Charlotte] Isn't it? - No. - Just say, no. - Come on, I mean, what kind of person would let someone in that situation down? - What kind of person would let me down? - I don't want to let anybody down. - I know. Just don't expect me to be happy about it. - Nice place. Posh. I'm not sure about that though. Did you do that? - [Sam] Uh, no. - [Frank] What's it about? - I don't know. - Why'd you hang it up, then? - I don't know. I'm surprised you haven't been here before. - I don't speak French. Ah, you've done well for yourself. That's good. - Was there anything specific? - Sarah's back. - [Sam] I know. - You know? - [Sam] Yeah, she came here the other night. - So, she told you. (dog barking) What are you standing there for? (gentle music) (light knocking) - Who is it? If you've come to see Frank, he isn't here. - [Sam] I haven't come to see Frank. - Look, Sam, I'm sorry about the other day. I didn't know you were married.

Sam, one minute, you're huddled up in your cozy rose-covered hut with Mrs. Right, then along comes an unwelcome memory to kick down the white picket fence. - No, I can assure you, Sarah, I'm not angry with you. - Good because it's not as if it's my fault. I mean, it's not as if you couldn't have come to America with me. - You didn't want me to come. - I never said that. Anyway, you're an adult, aren't you? Capable of making an adult decision. Would you have come to America, if I'd asked? (gentle music) - Well, it's a bit late in the day or that, isn't it? - It's very late in the day, that's why I'm asking. - Yeah, well, you should have asked me seven years ago. - Yeah, well, seven years ago, I thought I had all the time in the world. (cheerful music) (record crackling) - Try to imagine that the day after you find out that you have cancer is the same as the day before you knew. - How can it possibly be the same? I have cancer, I don't have cancer. Of course, you're gonna feel differently. I'd rather not have known. - The information will only alter your life only as much as you allow it to. You own the cancer, Jude, it does not own you. - Well, in that case, I can sell it. Does anybody want to buy some more cancer? - I would buy it from you, Jude, if I could. - Do you think any God, or whatever, has a right to take a life, to take my life? - Of course, not. That's just the way it is. Doesn't mean they can alter how you're gonna live it. Which would you prefer? Half a life in which you could live as you choose or a whole life where you were told what to do? - I want a whole life where I can do what I want. That's what most people get. - Yes, but the point is, they don't realize it. Most people never appreciate the value of their own lives. You do. If you live your lives to the full at all times, you'll have a bigger life. People who assume that they're immortal will always be waiting for a starting pistol. There isn't one.

Are you all right? Speak to me. Sarah? Sarah? - [Sarah] What is up with you? - For a minute there, I thought you weren't gonna pull the rip chord. - You'd be no good in a crisis. - [Charlotte] Skydiving? I didn't know you could skydive. - Anyone can skydive. You know, there's no skill involved. It's not as if you have a choice of direction. You jump out of a the plane, the parachute if it opens, and if you're still alive after you hit the ground, then you can skydive. - You never took me skydiving. - [Sam] I never knew you wanted to go. - You never bothered to ask. - Well, it's not one of the first things that springs to mind, is it? - You thought of it for her. - It was just one of the things on her list. (children chattering) - List? And how long's this list? - I don't know. - And you're just expected to do them all? - I suppose so. - What a chore. - What else am I supposed to do? I feel like I'm making intricate little sand castles here when there's a huge tidal wave coming in. It's, it's like trying to mend a typewriter. When you lift up the L key, then the K key falls out of place, and then when you finally get them together, then the M drops. So, what you really need is 24 tiny sets of hands, but you can't have that, so you end up juggling about with all these keys until you're too bloody tired to care whether the thing remains bust or not. - You could always use a pen? - Of course, a pen. Why didn't I think of that? (gentle music) (metronome ticking) - Dearest Frank, early this morning, I read about your change in season, so alive to me as though I was there beside you, I can smell the leaves of autumn even though here is still summer. - [Sarah And Shirley] I'm sitting high above 5th Avenue sipping coffee and, as always, thinking of you. Are you happy? - [Shirley] Sometimes, I feel so lonely and wonder if I'm in the right place here without you. Because without you, there really is only me. Think of me sometimes, as I think of you. I miss you, Frank. - [Sarah And Shirley] I miss you with all my heart. - Shirley. Shirley? (upbeat orchestral music) By the way, who's Shirley? Hmm? Were you unfaithful to Mum? - I don't want to talk about it. (both scream) - Frank! Close the window. - Where's the window thing? - It's up there. (cheerful orchestral music) Frank! What? ♪ Beautiful dreamer wake unto me ♪ ♪ Starlight and dew drops are waiting for thee ♪ ♪ Sounds of the rude world heard in the day ♪ ♪ Loved by the moonlight have all passed away ♪ - I didn't know you could sing. Did you take lessons? - No, my mother, she wanted me to be an opera singer. This was to save me working in the jam factory. - [Sarah] And? - Factory closed down. Some poor bugger fell in one of the vats, boiled to death. Named Chuck Davis, had a stutter. - Pa, pa, pa, please get me out of this ja, ja, jam. (Frank laughs) (sullen music) - I don't know where to start. - Here we are. International Directory Enquiries. - Who do I ask for? - Independent practitioners, research laboratories, The National Association of Surgeons, use your loaf. - In every town in every country all over the world? - [Sam] Well, what else were you gonna do today? - Well, I was thinking of weeding the borders. Right, now, what do I say? - Right, always ask to speak to a doctor, okay? Don't be fobbed off by some receptionist. Say you're a journalist. Ask if they're doing any research into brain stem carcinomas. - Aye? - Here, I've written it all down. Just find a bloody cure. - Do you think there is a cure? - [Sam] I don't know, Frank. It's a possibility. - She needs you, you know? - I'm here, am I not? I'm doing what I can. Everything I ever loved, I lost. I don't know if I can go through it again. (door creaks) - Ah. I'm glad I caught you two together. Right, the funeral. I don't want sandwiches in some drafty hall, too morbid. I want a three-course meal served with champagne. Or bourbon. Mozzarella, grilled egg plant, fennel, peppers, and endive with white truffle oil to start. I can marinade all those in advance. And then a choice of either mushroom risotto or paella. Actually, forget the paella, nobody ever gets it right. Mushroom risotto or, what about lamb? I'm gonna invite about 30 people, is lamb practical for 30? I'm not gonna bother with a choice of puddings. Christmas pudding will do, it keeps. Now, the service, I want that Jupiter piece by Holst. - I Vow to Thee My Country? - That's the one. And the REM song, Losing My Religion, unless you think it's too tacky for church. And yes, we will have a church service, even though I don't believe in God, because I know you do. The vicar can say what he wants at the service. It's a load of cobblers anyway. And the service should end with ♪ I love New York in June ♪ ♪ How about you ♪ in tune. Any questions? - What's eggplant? (Sam sighs) - Aubergine. Now, most of this I can do way beforehand. Frank, will it be okay to store the champagne in the loft? Sam, you won't forget to chill it, will you? - Wait, hang on a minute, why are we talking funerals? - Well, obviously, Franks' going to discover a miracle cure in the next couple of months, and we're all going to live happily ever after, but just in case, I mean, I don't want to be embarrassed at my own funeral. It's a shame I'll miss it, really. Right, I'm popping out for a while. Don't talk about me now. - I'm surprised she never asked you to build her a coffin. - She did. I saw this a couple of days ago. Do-it-yourself coffins, 160 pounds. You'd never believe it. - [Sam] Right now, I'd believe just about anything. - What's aubergine? (people chattering) - Jude, isn't it? We met at the support center. You didn't turn up last week. - Look, I'd had enough patronizing clap trap for that day. The last thing I need is for some guy who's gonna live forever lecturing me on the benefits of dying. Actually, there is one benefit. On the way here, I was cornered by a Jehovah's Witness. Do you know what I did? I punched that bastard, witness that, I said. - Come on, mate, I haven't got all day. - That is exactly what you've got. - Bloody lunatic. - She's 30. No, it's not in dog years. Why would it be in dog years. - I'm 24 years old and no one's gonna remember me 'cause I've done nothing worth remembering. I've left nothing behind. And when I die, life everywhere else is gonna go on exactly the same as normal because I haven't done anything. I might as well never have happened. (people chattering) - I'll remember you. - Cheers, but for how long. (Sarah sighs) - Morning. - Where are my teeth? I know you've got them, give 'em back. - I'll swap them. For Shirley's letters. - I burnt them. (sullen music) - Frank, I got carried away. I thought I could, you know, get you and Shirley back together again. It's stupid really. Sorry. - They're in the sideboard. She writes well, doesn't she? - She writes beautifully. - Sam. It's beautiful. What's it for? - Just because. - I love it. I love it. (both chuckle) (Charlotte giggles) - [Sam] I bought one for Sarah as well. - Did you buy one for me because you bought one for her or did you buy one for her because you bought one for me? What color? What color did you buy? - What difference does it make? - I just want to know. - I don't know, brownyish type color, I think. - Brown to match her eyes and red to match mine. (Charlotte stomping) (waves crashing) - Halloween already. Just think, this time next year, I'll be able to come back as a real ghost. Sorry. (Sarah sighs) I've been thinking, I don't really want a vicar. I don't want someone who doesn't know me going, she was a lovely, sweet girl. - Only someone who didn't know you would say that. (Sarah chuckles) Anyway, you do know the Reverend Pitchford. He christened you. - [Sarah] And I haven't seen him since. - Whose fault is that? - Couldn't you say something? - I wouldn't know what to say. - 'Course you would. You just have to stand up and say a few words about me. - Like what? - I don't know. If someone I'd never met asked you to describe me, what would you say? - I'd say you were stubborn, argumentative, belligerent, impossible, brilliant, beautiful, dying. Did you ever think of me when you were in New York? - All the time. All the time. I wanted to be successful. I wanted you to be proud of me. - I've always been proud of you. I would have been just as proud if you'd stayed here and married Sam. Or went to work in the co-op. - Really? - I would have loved you no matter what you did. How could I not love you? You're just the same as me. - Am I really that dim? (Frank sighs) (Sarah sighs) (light knocking) I got it last time. - I don't know anyone. - [Sarah] That's because you never answer the bloody door. - [Frank] Don't swear. - God! (door creaks) - Who is it? - [Sarah] Frank, go for a walk. - Why? - [Sarah] Frank, go for a walk or I'll put you in a home. - Go on, son. Oh. - Frank. You can come in now. Frank! Frank. - Can he finish his crap first? (gentle music) - I bought it for you so all the talent won't go to waste.

No, it's just that I remembered when we were watching King Kong and you said you didn't know why she was screaming. Everybody knew you couldn't kill yourself by jumping from the Empire State Building that easily, there was too much wind. You'd be lucky if you even managed to break a leg, let alone tough the ground. - And that's what stopped you? (Sam chuckles) - [Sarah] Yeah. - Jesus, I made all that up. (door creaks) - What are you doing down here? - I didn't want to wake you. - [Charlotte] Have a nice time? - What happened to your hair? Why did you do that? (Charlotte scoffs) - [Charlotte] Well, it worked, you noticed me. - I don't know who you are like that. - [Charlotte] No, but I bet I know who you'd like me to be. (tense music) - This isn't about you. Maybe you should try thinking of somebody else for a change. - [Charlotte] Like you are, you mean? - I'm going to bed. (Charlotte sobbing) (tense music) - I have so much to say to you. - [Sarah] What? - [Charlotte] I have a list, I've got a list. - [Sarah] I'm sorry. - Yeah, okay. It's not okay, it's not okay, it's just not okay, okay? (people chattering) - Aren't you frightened? Of there being nothing, nothing on the other side? That's it, that's your lot, and nobody warned you it was gonna be a short one.

How long you been standing there? - What are you doing? - [Sarah] I'm making a speech for the funeral. - You can't be serious. - Well, you wouldn't do it. Anyway, I think it's really original. - Well, it's morbid. You can't ask people to watch a video of you laughing-- - We agreed, I get last say on all funeral arrangements. - Well, I don't suppose you'll ever find out if I change them. - Should the unthinkable happen, I want to have all eventualities covered. - Should the unthinkable happen, do you want to be buried next to Mum? - [Sarah] Is that where you're gonna be? - Where else would I be? - I don't care where I am, as long as it's next to you. Come on, Frank, you've done so well up till now. - I just don't think I can take it anymore. You're my wee girl. You're the best thing I ever did, and we're sitting here talking about funeral arrangements. Who am I gonna argue with, huh? What's this? - Arguments, there's even one on cricket. It's a really boring one. I've allowed enough time between the contentious statements for you to answer concisely and accurately, but not enough time for you to get pompous, dogmatic, or to waffle. You can press the Pause button if you get really carried away. - Is there anything you haven't thought about? - I didn't do one on Shirley, but then, as far as I'm concerned, there is no argument. You will be going to America and you will be getting in contact with her. Why didn't you go to America with Shirley? - She never asked me. - Next week's meeting will be a little later, at 11. One last thing. We all have our own set of beliefs, whether spiritual or otherwise. I'd like us just to take a minute, think of a favorite song, a poem, a prayer, do whatever feels right in the next few moments. It's for Jude. Jude died yesterday. - He killed himself, didn't he? - Yes. (Sarah wailing) (birds squawking) (solemn music) - Let me get this straight. Three top New York surgeons have told me my condition is inoperable, yet you, Dr. Frank Hopson, have found a cure? Let me guess, boiled foot of crow and spring cabbage? Hypnotherapy, homeopathy? Or are we back to that good strong cup of tea again? - You finished? All I'm saying is I want you to see this one man in Edinburgh, for me. - And what will you do for me? Will you get in touch with Shirley? - Oh come on, not that again. - See, see how annoying it is? - I haven't seen her in years. I wouldn't know her if I fell over her. - I'm not asking you to fall over her. I'm asking you to telephone her. - I don't have her telephone number. - New York 550-4475. - I don't know the code. All right. All right. But you have to go to Edinburgh first. - And then you'll phone her? - Promise. - I can't hear you. - I promise! - Do I have to go? - I am gonna die first. That's the end of it. (Sam and Sarah cheering) - Woo! - Whoa! - That's is, Sarah! You've got it! You're a genius! - Oh, yeah! This was a fabulous idea. - Well, I have my moments. - [Sarah] Do you want to take over now? - [Sam] Look, you're doing all right for yourself. - My arms are about to come off. (gentle music) (both laughing) - Woo! - I could've done that. - Yeah, of course. - I didn't know you were allowed. Give me another go. - I thought your arms were about to come off. - Give me the kite. - No. - Sam, give me the kite. - No. - Sam! (both laughing) Give me the kite! - Well, it's broke, now. - [Sarah] It's your fault. (Sam and Sarah speaking faintly) You made your point. (tense music) (peaceful music) - [Sam] Ian, mate, how are we on potatoes? (patrons chattering) - You know, I've been thinking, maybe we should try for a baby. What do you think? Do you, do you think now would be a good time? - In the middle of a service? Why not? Eh, how about here, eh? How about now? Why not, good a place as any! (Sam panting) (patrons chattering) What about here? - Just, Sam, I just-- - Screw it, why not? I've got nothing else on my mind, do I? - It doesn't matter! Don't you turn your back on me. You think no one else has got feelings? You think no one else has been torn apart over this? What about me? Sitting around all day while you wine and dine your perfect match? What about your loyalty to me? You think I wanted to spend my life running a fucking restaurant. I did it all for you, all of it, everything. And now, I'm just having to sit by and watch while you get prized away by someone who wasn't even interested in you when she was well. I'm willing to devote my whole life to you, not just the bit that I've got left that's no use to anybody else. I can't win, can I? If she lives, will you stay with me? If she dies, will you stay with me because she's not around? You have to choose, Sam, her or me. If you see her again, I'll assume it's her. - Please, Charlotte, don't give me that ultimatum. - [Charlotte] I just did. - For God's sake, Charlotte, she's dying. - Good, I just wish she'd bloody well get on with it. (sullen music) - You look beautiful. If I was 20 years younger. - I'd be 10. - You off out? - Don't worry, I won't change my mind. - So, what's brought on this sudden change of heart? I thought you hated opera? - Well, it won't kill me. Anyway, it's your birthday. - I'll look forward to it. - [Charlotte] I'm going home to get changed. - Yep, I've got it here. Don't worry, Charlotte, the creases will be out by this evening. Get a taxi, I'll meet you inside. I'll be there. All right, bye. (Sam sighs) Sarah, what are you doing here? You look gorgeous. - [Sarah] I know. What's bavarois? - It's a very light, airy, set custard. - Yuck. - Oh, no, no, it's beautiful. You must have had it in New York. - Show me? No, wrong time, you're obviously in a hurry. - There is a time to hurry and there's a time to make bavarois. (upbeat jazz music) Eggs. And stop. There we go.

(sullen music) (audience chattering) (audience applauding) (peaceful music) (singing in foreign language) (church bell chiming) What time is? - Half past 10. - Good morning. - Morning. - Okay, Miss Hopson, this is the plan. We'll cut away as much of the tumor as possible and then we'll inject the remaining malign areas with a virus which we hope will kill it. - And that which does not kill us, makes us strong, right? - In theory. - How long will I take? - Well, that all depends on how accessible the tumor is, how much needs cutting away, whether there is much-- - [Sarah] Roughly. - [Dr. Frith] Five to six hours. - Will you stay awake? (doctor laughs) - Well, that's what makes it a challenge. - Goody, I always wanted to be a challenge. And what will you do? - Panic, walk the corridors, bite my nails, and I'll probably faint. - Excellent. Let's do it. Before I change my mind. (people chattering) - [Dr. Frith] Okay, Mr. Hopson, you can see her now. - So, it was a success? - Well, we haven't operated yet. We're still waiting for the test results. - Dad. I never thanked you for my childhood. Thanks. (people chattering) I don't want to. I don't want to go. I don't want to go. I don't want to go. - Will she be all right? - Save me, Dad. I don't want to, I don't want to go. I don't want to go. I don't want to go. - It's all right, Sarah. It'll be all right, Sarah. (Sarah sobbing) It'll be all right. It'll be all right. (sullen music) - [Woman] The hospital porter, please contact reception. The hospital porter, contact reception. - Sam. I think you may have had a wasted journey. - Nonsense. I'd travel a lifetime to spend one minute with you. - How romantic. - Anyway, you can't go now, I've got it all planned, I've even chosen a color for the front room. - So have I. - Good, then it can be our first argument. - I buggered it all up, didn't I? I buggered it all up. - No. No. It wasn't you. I should have followed you to America. I knew then. I know now. - It's funny, isn't it? We all rush around like frightened rabbits, desperate to keep up, trying to make sense of it all. And in the end, all anyone can really do is follow their heart. You've got such a beautiful face. (people chattering) - Aubergine! (sullen music) - It's pointless you mourning for me. I enjoyed my life. Naturally, you'll miss me. I'm highly intelligent, I've got a great sense of humor. (Sam chuckles) But society has such an archaic view of death, that it heralds the end of life. How do you know? Think of me at a better party. Don't think of me as being in a state of deadness. It doesn't exist. The point is, I'm not sad, so why should you be? I propose a toast, to me, my friends, my family, and my alarmingly successful time on earth. And remember, don't sleepwalk through life. Grab it, seize the day, and most of all, do not go gentle into that good night. Rage, rage against the dying of the light. Cheers.
