Castaways - Are ouy holding up? - I'm OK He's been talking about the ocean and fish the whole trip. Are you coming? What's the matter? Are you scared? He won't bother you? Can we go fishing? Caroline doesn't go fishing. She studies fish. - Did you work on your book? - Yes - What about him? - Four months in two seeks And what about you? I stay strong thanks to my little brother. - Do you want some coffee? - I have to go. He's waiting for me. I hardly know him. I only met him twice. - I must be completely mad - Just enjoy it Do you want to come say goodbye? Are we going to see the fish? We call it Lake of Death. It's a nice name, don't you think? Is it because of the people who died here? Like Farid? It's not the same dead. Although the dead of Lake of Death are all dead now. - Do you know how to fish? - No Do you know how to? My brother showed me how. Caroline? Caroline? Farid! How do you like yoursteak? Rare or well done? Rare well done. - You have to choose - Rare Are you sure? - Bon app√©tit - Thank you What's the matter? You are beautilful. That was Farid's seat. You are sitting where he used to. I need ketchup! Put on this shirt. Not with your t-shirt. He was dressed just like that the last time I saw him... He was walking to his car. I just saw his back... Show me your back. Just relax. - Stop moving! - Don't yell! Don't yell, don't yell, don't yell... I'm not yelling. Do yo want to keep them? Farid's clothes... Will you wear them? The pressure, the cold, the complete darkness, strange spieces. The ocean deapths hides the Earth's last mysteries. At the very bottom... In deapths forbidden to ordinary mortals, we find the last frontier of our planet. This is almost inaccessible territory. Very few have ever observed it. There are less people that's been beyond 1000 meters... ...than people that's been to space. But to work in this unknown world, man can use machines. Small submersible robots... ... called ROV's. They are the eyes and ears for submarine works. Telephone! Telephone! Telephone! It's OK, I've got another one. - I can fix it! - Let it be. It's nothing. - I can fix it! I know how to fix it! - Get out of the bathroom pleace. - Look! - Get out! - Are you sleeping? - Almost It's almost night. Did you bring your pyjamas? Sleep tight. Good night. - Caroline? - What are you doing here? - I went to the toilet - Go back to bed! I can't sleep with the tick-tock. If we remove the clock there won't be anymore tick-tock. I need the clock to tell the time. What do we do then? The tick-tock is not so loud here. If you move too much, you'll have to sleep on the couch. Caroline? Yes? Can I touch your belly? Why? - To feel the baby - There is nothing to feel, it's too early Is it Farid's baby? See? You can't feel anything. It's soft. Earlier you had your hand there. Why did you put you hand there? To be less sad. It's time to sleep now. Caroline! Are you now speaking today? What happened last night is our secret. OK? Go take a bath, it's late. I'm not like Farid. - Selma says I am, but I'm smaller - This is not a good time Go take a bath. No. I told you to take a bath! And stop that childish behaviour, it ridiculous! If you want to be like Farid, you have stop that! I'm not like Farid! I don't want to be like Farid! Farid is dead. Do you want to take a bath now? Be careful... This is hot, and this is cold. I'll be careful. There's no soap! - Can you wash my back? - Sit down. - How did it go? - Very well What about your romantic weekend? Don't! He was a very bad lover. Are you not going to say hello? Hello. Did he bother you? Let's go. We've got a long trip. Are you saying goodbye to Caroline? Careful, don't suffocate her. Ready to leave? Give him one more day. I'll bring him back. He wants to teach me how to fish. Are you sure? Well... I'm going to the cemetery on Sunday. Are you coming with me? I'll let you know. You are strong, you know. Stronger than me.
