Sir, I was forced to take action due to other circumstances. Yeah? Go on. Is this what you're afraid of? Look boy. Is it an excuse because you're afraid of these two ladies? Didn't you learn anything at the academy? How to talk to people? I seem to remember something about you talk to people before you take out your nightstick. Sir, I never struck them once. Obviously.

Well, she's like a mommy, huh? She does everything that mom used to do. Yeah. So, that's good. But she's not my mommy. Well, I know. But she's here all the time just like mommy, huh? But why is she here all the time? Well, because she is. Now put your jammies on. But why she here all the time? Well, because mommy can't be here. Why can't mommy be here? Well, because... Just because. Mommy doesn't love me anymore. No, Kevin. It's because she does love you that she can't be here. She loves you more than anything in the whole wide world. And she'll be with you soon. She will? Yes, she will. I'm just your friend, Kev. I like you as my friend. Your mommy will always be your mommy and no one can ever replace her. And she'll always love you no matter where she is. That will never change. Okay? Okay. Now you give me a big hug. You get to bed. You need some help? No thanks. I'm a big man now. Okay. Good night. Good night. I wish you hadn't had done that. Done what? Disagree with me. I didn't. Yes, you did. I was just telling him the truth, Sam. People need to hear the truth. Oh, you know what he needs and I don't? Okay, I don't know what he needs. But I know what I need. What? What are you talking about? You know damn well what I mean and don't hide from me. I'm not five years old. I stopped believing in Santa Claus and the tooth fairy years ago. What do you believe in? I believe in making choices in life. I believe you can't count on anybody but yourself. What about love? I can't make your choices for you. You're a big boy, Sam. Love's funny, huh? I'm not laughing. [phone rings] I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. Hey, hurry up. I bet you that's mommy. [phone rings] I need some time. I can't wait. I've already made my decision. I'm leaving in the morning. That's your choice. You know when I played this conversation in my head, you tried to stop me. Guess I was wrong, huh? Did you have fun at the zoo? Yeah, I had lots of fun. What's wrong? Nothing. I just wanted to hear your voice. I love you. I love you too. Can you put daddy on for a second? Dad. Dad. Yeah, Kev? Mom, wants to talk to you. Okay. Can I watch a little bit of TV? Yeah, for five minutes. Okay? Okay. All right. I'll be up to tuck you in in a minute, okay? Okay. Jackie, hi. Hi, Sam. How was the ride back? It was okay. Driving's driving. Kevin have a good time? Yeah, you know Kev. He always has a good time. He'd probably had a better time if you were around. I think I'd probably have a better time if you were around too. We had some good times together, huh? We had some great times together. Sam. Maybe we shouldn't be talking like this, huh? Maybe we should have talked like this a long time ago. Sam. I know. I know. I got an idea. Why don't you come pick up Kevin in the morning and take him for a few days, huh? You would do that for me? What are they going to do? Arrest me? I can't, Sam. Not tomorrow. Jackie, you're always giving me crap about not seeing him. Now I want you to see him. Listen, don't make me out to be the bad guy here. Just listen to me, listen to me. It's got nothing to do with you. I sent you something in the mail, did you get it? Yeah, I haven't opened it yet. Don't open it. Jackie, what's the matter? I can't tell you. Just take it and put it some place safe. Sam, if something happens to me, I want you to take it to the newspapers. What's going to happen? Look, Jackie. Let's stop this. Why don't you come by, pick up Kevin in the morning, okay? I got to go, Sam. Just do this for me. Please, do this for me, Sam. Please. Jackie? Jackie?

Jackie, what's going on? What do you mean? I mean they dragged me in for questioning today. They found out we were seeing each other. Now Eddie Martin, the detective who questioned you, told your parole officer, went to a judge, got a search warrant. I can't believe this. Just believe it. Because he thinks you shot your friend. He claims he's got proof. Something about she owes you money, she's sleeping with your ex. Now, look. I don't care what the answer is, but everybody's asking me questions. I feel like an idiot. Just tell me the truth. She was my friend. She was my husband's friend. I owed her, she owed me some money for some work that I did. Eddie Martin is a liar. Look. I believe you. Why would he make up such a story? Huh? I don't know what to do, Frank. Forget it. It's okay. It's okay. Just take it easy. I know what to do. I know what to do. Look, where are the negatives? They're safe. If something happens to me, they're going to go right to the police. Jackie, please let me help you. I know what I'm doing. Now what did you do with the negatives? I gave them to someone I trust. Someone you trust? Someone who trusts you? Oh, God. They're with your husband, aren't they? Just stay out of it, Frank. I got it from here, buddy. Thanks. How could you? Why didn't he tell you? Our girls make a lot of money for us. Right partner? [crying] You. I'll get the negatives. Good idea. And I'll just have a little fun. Please, have a seat. Sit down. Want a drink? I didn't think so. God bless all the animals at the zoo. God bless daddy. God bless Sheila. Most of all God bless mommy. Two murders in one apartment in the same day. Coincidence? I think not. [doorbell rings] Detective Frank Wilson. I need to ask you some questions about your wife Jackie Swanson. A drug dealer on parole now back into business. She just dealt to the wrong person. Have you received any mail or envelopes from your wife? No. Yes, we did. No, we haven't. Sam, I saw it with my own eyes. It wasn't from her. It was on the counter. It wasn't from her. I believe you. Where is it? [gunfire] [screaming] No! No! [gunfire] It's too bad, but there's a time to live and a time to die. I guess now is a good a time as any. Got to go. Got to go. [gunfire] [gunfire] [coughing] [gunfire] [coughing] [gunfire] ♪ music ♪ ♪ music ♪ [phone ringing] Come on, Sam. [phone ringing] Sam. ♪ music ♪ Kevin?
