Allow me, dear Agathe, to thank you again for the lovely night For the delightful night. You can do better… Thank you. Listen, my doll, you shouldn’t be in your pyjamas. Mmm, it’s warm in here… First you'll get cold, then it’ll stir me again. - I won’t be able to leave! - Stay then! Let’s have a good breakfast. - Ah, I have an appointment for breakfast. - With whom? Your nose is wiggling, your eyes are shining, your ears are shaking, and you hold your breath like a woman… who smelled a rival. Of course not! You know I'm not jealous at all. - Am I jealous? - Of course not! You’re really, really open-minded. - When can we meet again? - I'll certainly call you. Don’t make me laugh, I know deep down, God knows when you'll call me again. Quiet now, darling, or I won’t call you at all. With all my love. Women’s laments after a sleepless night, I can't take it! - Get lost, bastard! - I adore you! Happy Sunday. Rémi! Rémi! - What are you doing here? - Dear Chloé, what a surprise! What a beautiful morning! The air is so pure. You are so beautiful. But you'll get cold. They'll all get cold! - Cut the crap! - Bravo! Chloé swears! - I will slap you. - Then I’d rather leave as your friend. - I… I didn't see you at the party. - I didn’t go to it. - Then what are you doing here? - It's a secret! Did you spend the night with your old friend Agathe? What a phony… So her terrible headache at 12 o’clock, it was you? - Rémi, are you listening to me? - Absolutely not. Rémi, why do we never see each other? Our paths have… that's all. Besides… - Am I no longer beautiful enough for you? - Of course you are. Look at me. Elegant enough? Intelligent enough? Is my skin no longer soft enough? You see, I have no more self-esteem than Agathe. You cheat on her, you forget her, she says nothing. You whistle, she comes. Rémi, whistle for me sometime. My friend, I think you're a little tipsy. And I'm already late. So I'll see you one of these days. BECAUSE, BECAUSE OF A WOMAN The car’s registration number is 40 03 GT 75. I repeat, 40 03 GT 75. Lisette… you know what I'd like when you have a child? That you call him Rémi. - Even if it’s a girl? - And I'd be his beloved godfather. - Oh, you won't be his daddy? - No, no, no. He'll love me and respect me more than his father. I’ll give him some wise advice. We'll make a humanist out of him. And later, like me, he'll dedicate his life… to aeroplanes. What did you do last night to be yawning like that? Curiosity killed the cat, young lady. What a mess in this glove box! What on earth is that? - And what is that? - That is me! - Yes! To love aeroplanes, to love Lisette… You could say Lisette before aeroplanes! To drive one’s own little car, neat and tidy. Well-greased, well drained, a healthy machine. What is this? Your papers, please. I'm starting to feel hungry, what about you? Soon we’ll have lunch, it’s already past noon. OK now, you go back. The ride is over. We'll drive you back to Paris. What? Let’s go, and don’t be a smartass! My friend, I think you're a little tipsy. And I’m already late, so I’ll see you one of these days. Stop! And where are you going now? - To my car. - Like that? Casually? No halt? - Exactly. - What a bad memory you have, Mr. Fertet. Since you don't seem to remember what you did, we'll tell you. Please, Miss. Don't be afraid, darling! It won't be long. A chair for the lady. I'm listening. Well, Chloé, we're listening. This morning, I met Rémi in the park. He spoke to me. He seemed odd. When he left I followed him. And suddenly I heard voices, an argument. Thank you. I arrived here, and I saw Olivier and Rémi fighting. Then, Olivier staggered, and he fell in the water. And Rémi ran away. Then I ran, I called for help. Olivier was drowning and nobody came. I jumped in the lake and dragged Olivier to the surface. I felt that I would sink myself. I called and called, but no one came. I was exhausted. Finally, someone came, but it was already too late for Olivier. - He was dead. - I'm very sorry to hear that! But tell me, why would I have hit and drowned the poor guy? Miss, please repeat what you said in this regard. We were about to get married, Olivier and me. Everybody knows that. This morning, Rémi made a terrible scene. He was furious. He couldn't accept that I loved somebody else. - He hated Olivier. - I hated Olivier? But why? Out of jealousy? Poor Chloé… You know very well that I don't love you. - I have letters from you. - Which we have. All right, let's go on. Let's raise an important question. You were not invited last night, were you? Isn't that right, Mr. Linthal? Absolutely. The young man is an engineer in my factory, but he is no relation of ours. Then the question is: Sir, what were you doing here? He came for me. - He follows me everywhere since we broke up. - Oh, that's enough. You made your little drama, now you will tell the truth like a nice girl. But I’m telling the truth. Listen to me, Sir. You were here, uninvited, a number of people saw you, and identified you when you ran… towards your car, which you started like a madman. The best part is, we caught you 150 km out of Paris. On a ride, so you say. - On the run! Let’s say. - I was going for lunch in the country. With a girl. I wasn’t doing anything wrong, if I may say so… But anyway, that is none of your business. I cannot believe it! I didn't even see Olivier this morning. I didn't see anyone. Besides Chloé! Oh, and… A random guy I met by the lake, when I was leaving. I don't even know who he is. But it wasn't Olivier. I didn't see Olivier. I didn't drown Olivier. And I will not let you push me around. Wait… This guy I met by the lake. He saw me walk and leave without guilt. A fortuitous witness, and you didn’t mention it earlier? In any case, besides Olivier and Rémi, I didn't see anyone. We know that, Miss. You don't believe I met this man? And you won't even try to find him? What man, Sir? You understand we don’t believe you. But I know very well I’m innocent! I have something to say. You asked Rémi earlier why he was here in the morning. He spent the night with me. Don't listen to her, she didn’t even leave us once last night. And thank you, Rémi, for not saying a word of it. So what? Even if you were telling the truth, what would that change? He would have come for two girls instead of one? That wouldn't be any nicer. All right, I think all is clear now. In a manner of speaking, because… the whole picture is getting blurry. Let’s go! Forgive me, Rémi, to hurt you again, but… you know, I loved Olivier. For another man I wouldn’t have said a thing, but not for him. Not for him. You’re a bitch. Listen to me, this is serious. So no petty jealousy between us. - There is strength in unity. - So, is there nothing else to do? This girl will put me in jail for years, and everyone is fine with that. With a good lawyer you’ll still be able to enjoy your old age. We'd like to say goodbye to Rémi. Quickly then. - I'm going to the Etoile, do you need a lift? - Yes, thank you. My leg! My leg! For God’s sake! Keep looking, and bring him to me. You, find me the names and addresses of his friends, and keep a watch on them. We'll pick him up like a flower. Yes, I'm coming! Ow! Nathalie, down! Down! Hello. Hello. I was worried I wouldn't find you. But… you can't come in! Nathalie, move! - What do you want? - I came here last month, it was so crowded. People everywhere, I don’t even remember who brought me. Earlier, I was in the neighborhood… I thought about you. I thought I didn't even know your name. Or you mine. Claude. I can't have you here now. Come back another day. Come Nathalie. No, don’t leave me like this. I ran up the stairs two by two, see how my heart beats! - Gosh, you’re freezing! - Yes, and I'm spilling water all over. Dry up quickly, put on a nice and warm robe, and you'll get rid of me later, go on! My God, what a beauty! Tell me I can stay just a little longer. Have a drink, I don't want you to get cold because of me. I'm not cold anymore, and I’m not thirsty. Tell me, will you be long? Tell me we’re having dinner together. And if you don't want to go out, we'll have it here. - I'm a very good cook. - It's impossible, I have to leave. Goodbye. Very well. Is everything all right? I was right. I was right to walk back every day at your front door… and to leave with no courage to knock. Every day? You're crazy. Yes. I won’t disturb you any longer. I'm leaving! Goodbye. Oh, I'm ashamed! I'm ashamed! Stay away, Nathalie. Come on. Come on. Tell me the truth now. - And enough with your advances. - I can't. Are you in trouble? It’s a sordid story. Are you out of money? Since when? A long time. But of all your friends, why me? I don’t have any friend. They couldn’t feed me or host me any longer. To host you? So you don't have a room? Were you thrown out? OK, now I'm leaving. Oh, I’m dizzy… Oh I know, you're hungry! I'm so silly, don't look at me. Stay here, you hear me, I'm watching you. From the kitchen, I’m watching you. By the way, I’m Nathalie, like my dog. You can sleep here tonight, there are two beds. No, I can't accept it. How can I thank you? If I said you'll stay, you’ll stay. End of discussion! All right, Nathalie. I’ll do as you say, Nathalie. You're too kind, Nathalie. Thank you… Hello? Good evening, Madam. Can I speak with Miss Lisette Valadi please? Her phone isn't working, it's on the third floor. It's very important. I’m sorry to disturb you. Thank you Madam. Here we go. Food is coming right away. I took the liberty of making a call. I had a fight with my parents, so I’ll try to make it up with them. I can't take it anymore, I'll ask Lisette to help me. It’s our old housemaid, she really likes me. Hello Lisette? Mr. Claude speaking. Darling, where are you? Is everythingOK? - Why didn’t you call me at home? - Thank you, my dear Lisette, everything is well. I'd like to see you tomorrow morning. Well, I’m sorry, too bad for your work, Lisette. Please make sure not to take “Bobby” with you. It would break my heart to see him. That's my dog. Is he with you now? Bobby? Bobby… No, he's having a walk in the street. - But… he'll follow me tomorrow! - Shake him off, Lisette! She says that he'll follow her. Good boy. I don't know how to shake it off! I'll never make it! Thank you. Food should be warm by now. I called you there because your phone must be tapped. Pick me up me tomorrow morning, with a taxi, 10:00. It’s 418, Saint-Honoré Street. If you're in trouble, it’s Opéra 35 31. And thank you for everything, Lisette dear. Oh, Rémi, I really want to see you. But I'm afraid, I will never make it. - How will I do it? - You'll find out. I'm sure you'll find out, Lisette. See you tomorrow, Lisette! Mmm, Nathalie… This is lobster bisque… from the can! Enjoy your meal, Claude. You should eat. You're hungry. Not anymore. A CRIME OF PASSION ENTHRALLS THE PARISIANS. FOILED BY HIS EX-GIRLFRIEND’S TESTIMONY… THE KILLER RAN AWAY! THE POLICE ARE AFTER HIM. - Porte Molitor. - Porte Molitor. Don't move! My face is all over the news this morning. Where are we going? I think we'll be fine here. An ice skater looks absolutely innocent. Poor Nathalie. Her name was Nathalie. She must have felt bad when she read the newspaper this morning. I hope she won't be too mad at me. You know, I'll go and see her when this is all over. I'll explain everything. Yes. You see, I'm not jealous. OK, we'll stay here until dark. Are we going to skate all day? Under this rain? Where will we go after that? Where will you go after that? Oh Rémi, it would be so nice if we were just skating, you and me, if everything was fine. Come on Lisette, we're not here to cry, but to think. - All right. - I'd like to know what happened. Olivier drowned. - Why? How? - Do you want to know what I think? - That girl pushed Olivier in the lake. - Chloé? I stop you right away. For Chloé, Olivier was a great match, she had no interest in ditching him. And she jumped in the water to save him. Then why did she lie if she didn’t do it? Because she wants to hurt me. - Why? - Because she's in love with me. - But you don’t love her. - Exactly. But… the letters she gave to the police, what was that? - Weren't those love letters? - Yes. Were you in love with her before? - Yes. - Very much? - No. All right. So actually, maybe Oliver fell in the lake on his own. - Like that, by accident? - Maybe he was drunk. Or he did it deliberately, maybe he was in trouble. Maybe. Maybe not. Maybe someone pushed him anyway. But who? Maybe this guy I saw in the park when I was leaving. No! Does this guy really exist? When you told the cops about him, he seemed to come out of the blue. I was sure you made him up. He does exist. - I'd like to find him. - Indeed. He's a really suspicious character. He saw you, he could have said you didn’t do anything, he disappeared. It’s suspicious. He saw you didn’t do anything! - He could have said you didn’t do anything! - Yes. I was at the end of the lake, he almost saw me get into my car. Nobody was in the lake at this moment, you can trust me on that. So this is it, for sure. He pushed Olivier in the lake. Chloé saw it all, and she said it was you because actually she’s in love with him. Wait, wait. And he was jealous of Olivier. They had a fight, and then: Splash! Splash! Anyway, whether it’s him or not, we need to find this guy. We mostly need to have Chloé tell the truth. And all that while playing hide-and-seek with the police. Oh Rémi, life is so sad. I love you so much, and you love life so much, and everything, and they want to put you in jail. Indeed… you can say I’m really not intuitive. Yesterday morning I was with Agathe. I was happy. I was a bit sleepy but happy. I had the whole day ahead of me, calm, nice. I knew what I was going to do: spend the day with you, and I was pleased. And I looked at all these people, I looked at them... Maybe I saw Olivier. Maybe I even saw that guy. I saw Chloé, and didn’t feel anything. Not even the smallest intuition. My ears were cold, that's all. Well… that's not entirely true. It's funny, you will believe I am making that up. I remember now. All of a sudden I felt a sort of anguish. Why? I had, just like now, a heavy heart. Ah, yes. What about Olivier, do you think he had a foreboding? Tell me, Rémi! Rémi! Rémi. Rémi! Rémi. What's with you, what are you thinking about? Nothing. Shall we skate? All right, I definitely need to see Agathe now. She knows Chloé, she must know this guy. She can help me now. Why didn’t you go skate with her instead of wasting your time with me. - Since I'm useless. - Of course you're helpful, Lisette dear. I wanted to see you, it's my right. All right, now I have to see Agathe. But you'll help me a lot afterwards. OK. You see, I always told you you can count on girls. That is true. Long live women! They have a kind heart and no ethics. Just what I need right now. And always, by the way! I'm cold! I'm soaked! My whole body hurts! All right, as soon as it's dark, you'll call Agathe to come and pick me up here. - And what if I reach her parents? - She has her own phone. You know, I think I’ll be safe over there. It's really the last place the police will be looking for me. - What about me? - You? You mustn’t go back home. You managed to get rid of the cops, you should take advantage of it. So tonight you go to the hotel, and you call me at Agathe's. Ah yes. So I don’t go to work tomorrow either? - No, does that bother you? - No! - All right, do you have money? - Yes. OK, Agathe will lend me some. - Go to a luxury hotel. - Hey, I'm not a billionaire! They rarely ask for ID, if you have luggage. You take a fake name. You play the tourist, or just invent a story. Yes, isn’t it amusing? Yes, is it. HE DISAPPEARED WITH HIS YOUNG AND PRETTY PARTNER THE YOUNG ENGINEER WHO MURDERED FOR LOVE HAD AN ACCOMPLICE - To Saint-Cloud, please. - Camouflage! At your command! I’m really happy to see you again, you know. Oh, he's so tired! Gosh your feet are soaked! Mmm, your place si so cosy, Agathe! It smells good. I made cocktails in the afternoon with cologne and perfumes. Doesn’t it smell good? I called this one Rémi. Good, it’ll smell good everywhere. - Are you hungry? - Yes. What do you want to eat? Handsome prince. Handsome prince! You slept for three hours. You need to eat something. And put on some pyjamas! But I need a shower! May I? Ah, Lisette called, she left her number. - Did she see her picture in the evening paper? - Yeah sure, she was so mad! An old and ugly picture. You crazy girls, both of you, at least nobody can recognize her! Excuse me. Rémi, we're not stupid. We saw your assets! - Come on, this is really unpleasant. - Poor Lisette, and poor Agathe. You're really in trouble because of me, aren’t you? Why would you say that? We're happy to help you. I know you're kind. But I think I shouldn’t have run. I was innocent, and I acted like a criminal. But they were convinced you were a criminal, they didn’t have any doubt. If they were so sure, they would have kept a closer watch on me. They would have handcuffed me. I don’t know. So I couldn't escape. No, they pretended to be sure. They put on an act to intimidate me. It worked! Had they told me to escape… And I ran away like an idiot without thinking. If they didn’t have enough evidence against me, now I’m obviously guilty. Don’t bother looking any further! Don’t you have a pair of pyjamas over here? That's not a pair of pyjamas. But it suits me anyway. Here you go, they’re my father’s. Turn around. You know Rémi, since nobody believed you, we thought it would be best for you to run so we could prove you were innocent. - You couldn’t have done so in jail. - Ah, do you think it’s easier now? But never mind. Freedom is good. It's sweet, scented, warm and cosy. I'm starving. What are you doing? Come here! I don’t know if I'll go to bed. Of course you'll go to bed. What about Lisette? That’s my business, little girl. What about Chloé? I didn't know you sent her passionate letters. But I have a way with words, my little flower. And women appreciate so much love letters! They're so kind afterwards! You're a funny character, you know. - It's not always easy to love you. - Why? You are the ones who are complicated. I used to like Chloé, I like Lisette a lot. - I like you a lot. - And so many others and you don't love anyone. Never mind, I prefer to see you like this than not at all. - Don’t you want to eat? - I'm not hungry. Oh come on, these aren’t real problems. I'm here now, and this is what matters! All right, let’s get to work. Tell me, who is this guy I met in the park? What was he like? Young, blond, around thirty. I remember him. Maybe I'm wrong, but I think I saw him in the drawing room. When we were both watching, yesterday morning. Yes, I think he was there. So you must have seen him too. If only I could remember what he was doing. I remember only one blond guy when we were watching. The one who was dancing with Chloé. A guy named Muller. Was he dancing with Chloé? He was dancing with Chloé... Yes, that's it! He was dancing with Chloé! It's him. I would have told you so immediately if you had told me he was blond. Blonds are rare! We’re lucky he's blonde. Had you said a man with brown hair, we’d still be looking for him. So his name is Muller. Yes. He’s into records. He's the artistic director of a huge American company, or German, I don't remember. Rémi, you're falling asleep again. Yes, I'm tired. We'll take care of Muller tomorrow. Let's sleep... OK then, I'm moving out. Which hotel is it? Prince de Galles? All right, so I'll take the room next to Muller’s, and as soon as he leaves I'll search and search everywhere! By the way, what am I supposed to find? Letters from Olivier, from Chloé, pictures… I don't know! Threatening letters, blackmail letters. Maybe someone bought his silence, and you’ll find evidence. All right. And the rest of the time, I'll be by the wall listening to everything he says. That's it. As soon as you’re settled, call me. Huh? Ah, he stays at the hotel because... because he's not French. He’s travelling. - Good luck, see you later. - Bye Lisette! [Southern accent] Good morning Sir, I'd like a room, please. And tell me, can I ask you something? Isn’t there a certain Mr. Muller staying at your hotel? Absolutely, Miss. Oh, it’s embarrassing… I'd like a room next to his. Let me explain: my name is Rosaline Meunier, and M. Muller is in the music industry. And in Aix-en-Provence, it’s my home, I was told... I need to tell you that I’m a singer. An opera singer! Not a mainstream singer. I was told to audition for Mr. Muller, but I don't know him. So if I had a room next to his, we could meet! It's possible, Miss. Room 127. It's awful. There's no door between the two rooms. I can’t see nor hear anything, I will never know whether he’s here or not. Yes there are balconies. But I'm not going out there, I'm not an acrobat. There are two meters in between! The best thing to do is to lure him somewhere and keep him busy long enough so you can search his room. How could we do that… Agathe, couldn’t you invite him for dinner tonight? You know him well enough. - I could try. - OK, we’ll call Muller then call you back. Hello Rémi? So he's going to Agathe’s, all right. So I'll pretend to leave, then come back, then I’ll casually ask the doorman to… oh, I think it’s room 128. Well I’ll check on my way. Then I'll say I made a mistake! Bravo. All right, as soon as Muller arrives, we'll call you. By the time he eats you'll have all the time you need. See you tonight. Have a good day, Lisette. Have a good day… I've had better days. But you seem happy, that’s a start. Hugs and kisses. Rémi, I spoke with Chloé, she is also coming. Where are you? Muller will arrive soon, you know, it's almost 8:00. I can’t wait to see them face to face. - Why didn't you turn on the light? - What if… - if it's not Muller that I saw in the park? - Well, we won’t let that discourage us. “Hasten slowly and without losing heart…” Come help me! In any case, we still have your friend Chloé. Maybe she knows nothing more than we do. She saw Olivier in the lake, she said it was me without knowing what happened. Maybe he fell on his own? But his jacket was torn. He couldn't have torn it on his own, right? Maybe he tore it earlier? - Maybe it was an old jacket. - Oh dear, what’s wrong with you tonight? Your eyes are sinking and your ears are droopy. - A cocker spaniel! - Yes, I feel small, small… and weak, weak… A wimp. A cocker spaniel. OK, then let’s just drop everything and turn you in. - Feeling better? - Yes, Agathe. - Shall we go? - Yes, Agathe. - Smile. - Yes, Agathe. Let’s go, dummy. So, as soon as Muller arrives, if it's him you call Lisette immediately. - Then you'll have all dinner to watch him. - Is he coming alone? No, he's coming with a girl. He brings her everywhere. OK, I leave you here. - Rémi, is this him? - Yes. - Did you call Lisette? - No, I forgot. You need to do it right now! Yes and then I'll have a nap. Wake me up when they leave. Chloé will wake you up! Lisette? You can go, he's eating. Good luck, kisses. - They're leaving, we must inform Lisette. - What happened? Nothing. It's this girl, all of a sudden she wanted to leave. She must be out of her room now. Hello? Miss Meunier please, room 127. Let’s hope she’s there. It's ringing and ringing. She's in Muller's room, and he'll be there in 5 minutes. No answer? Then room 128, please. Oh, are they out? OK, thank you. - What can we do? - We can only try telepathy. I really wonder if you have a heart, sometimes. It’s OK, I have time. Yes, you see, I left the keys on the door. I’m sorry, what are you doing in my room? - You’re crushing me! - Sorry. Don’t you want to tell me what you’re doing in my room? I entered the wrong room. Why have you been rummaging through my drawers? I rummaged through my drawers! I didn't know I was in the wrong room, so… No wonder I couldn’t find anything! Then, why were you so scared? Why did you… towards the door? Because, when I saw you I thought I was in the wrong room! By the way, I was right, since I was in the wrong room… Then, you understand… Your head is as fast as your legs. And yet I caught you, so… tell me, what are you doing in my room? I won't tell you anyhow. All right, then… goodnight. Molitor 53 30… Molitor 53 30, please. Ah, I suppose you know why I'm calling you! And you’re laughing! Bravo, nice timing. - He was there 5 minutes after me! - Don't be mad, Lisette dear! It’s not my fault. I have to hang up. I'll call you back. Oh, I ate too much. Your mom is merciless, she always serves fattening food. May I? So? This hairstyle looks strange on you. Strange? You think so? I forgot to tell mother something, I'm coming back. Agathe! Open up! So Chloé… Dont you want to hit me? Are you disappointed? I knew you wouldn’t hurt me, you wouldn't hurt a fly. I like to hear you saying it. But tell me Chloé! You're getting fatter… If a girl had done to me what I did to you, I would have killed her. That doesn’t surprise me at all, honey. Poor Rémi, I wonder what I saw in you. Thank you for laughing, Rémi. I was about to do something stupid. I was about to tell you the truth. If I had kissed you, would you have told the truth? - To the police also? - Maybe. Tell me Chloé, is this blackmail? I want to be free, but this is not worth it. I suggest you to leave, because you know what I’m going to do now? Let me guess! The phone is right here, if you want. No thank you. I had enough of you. Agathe, open up! We’re done here. I'm waiting, thank you. You see how strange a man can be. I liked Chloé tonight! Hello Lisette? I'm coming. Chloé just left, she'll talk to the cops. - Is Miss Meunier in her room, please? - Yes, Miss. Then be a dear and tell her I brought the book she wanted. Miss Agathe. Hello, Miss Meunier? Someone just brought a book for you. Shall I send it up to you? Very well, Miss. This will be done. Right away, Miss. - It is done, Miss. - Thank you, Sir. Oh Rémi! I'm so happy you'll spend the night with me. It’s not a funny situation, you know, for a loving woman like me. One night here, one night there… I know that all is fair in love and war… But I feel better when you’re with me. You don't speak much. Damn, I forgot! You need to hide for a minute, they're bringing the book. I guess you’ll just have to hide on the balcony. - Is Muller's room this way? - Yes. Come back in! Rémi. Rémi, what's wrong? What's your name? Rémi! Good morning! Are you already up? No, I'm still in bed! You know, the bird flew away. The bird? What bird? Was there a bird on the balcony? No, silly, Muller! I know, I was playing stupid. - Do you like stupid girls? - Lisette, every one left next door. Maybe you scared him. Ask the doorman, maybe he knows something. [Southern accent] Hello? I'd like to speak to Mr. Muller please, room 128. Where is he then? Where? Foucherolles? What is he doing there? Ah, all right… Thank you. Sorry to bother you… [Southern accent] You’re quite a character, Lisette! He's in Foucherolles for two days. He’s recording music. - Where are you going? - I'm going there! - Are you crazy? - But Lisette, in two days I might be… Or at least like that. There’s no time to lose. I don't know if it's worth it but I need to follow him. But you can't go out! I was going crazy at Agathe’s, locked in all day with nothing to do. I'll rush. I'll be so happy and confident that nobody will recognize me. You'll see. Standing tall. - I'll smile to everyone. - I’ll go too then! There's no reason… - No, I'll go alone, Lisette. It’s better. - All right. - I'll go out alone then. - And you'll be done searching Muller's room. All right, I'm leaving and I’m taking that. Also that. You didn't even say goodbye. Boss, look up! Stop! We were not expecting you, but we're still happy to see you. And, where is Mr. Rémi Fertet? No, no I won't tell you where he is. Even if you torture me. You should watch your mouth, darling. You know, we don’t actually need you. It won’t be long before someone sees him, his picture is everywhere. And eventually he’ll come back here. So let’s wait for him. It’s a beautiful fire, don’t you think? I'm sorry, I didn't hear. Did you say something? Why do you look so sad? - Do I look sad? - You do. This is odd. I am very shy, but when people look sad, I am not shy at all. On the contrary, I want to talk. Do you think this is a pretty word: “barcarole”? Very pretty. - What are you reading? - The dictionary. I look at the words. I like pretty French words. I'm at B, and already on page 98. I still have a lot to read. And “machicolation,” do you find that pretty? Cecilia? Cecilia? - You know that I'm the smartest. - Yes. I won at the billiard table. But I’ve missed you. - And you, have you missed me? - Yes. I'm tired. It's late. All right, let's go to bed. Somebody recognized you, go to my car and wait for me. It's the gray Mercedes at the entrance, I’ll be there immediately. Hurry up! Why do you go out? We’re leaving, get back in! - All right, I'll sit at the back. - There's no room at the back. Cecilia… Where shall I drop you off? Wherever you go will be fine. They haven’t told the police yet. They're still discussing but it's a matter of minutes. - They're discussing? - Some are for and some against it. - The police? - Yes. But there’s this excited guy, a real righter of wrongs… I forgot to thank you. - You, when did you recognize me? - Me? I have no idea who you are. There was a small group next to me, and I could hear: “It's him!”, “It's not”, “Yes it is!” I thought they were talking about a celebrity. I heard: “The picture in the newspaper”, then “police”, “report him”. That’s it, my ears! Johann… I found who they were talking about and I came to tell you. - But why? - Why why? Why are you doing this for a murderer? You don't look like a murderer. Are you a murderer? - I think you know very well who I am. - No, I really don’t! I know it’s a shame, but I never read the papers. - Only music reviews. - Did you know Olivier Linthal? - The man who died? Yes. - I killed him. - Well, that’s what people say. - Is it true? - What do you think? - I don’t think it’s true. Why? Because you're… handsome, I think. I can’t imagine that handsome people would do evil things. - You're right, I didn't kill him. - Do you know who killed him? - I'm not sure. - Can I help you, maybe? Yes. Did you push Olivier Linthal in the lake? Me? No, not at all. - Did you think it was me? - Yes. Why not. The police thinks it's you. Someone just called from Foucherolles. He was seen over there earlier. So… Roads, train stations, city gates of Paris. The usual roadblocks. Usually we go to bed early. We stayed up late that night because I wanted to take pictures of Cecilia, the morning in the park, at dawn, with the fog and the long dress. It's pretty. And when you saw me by the lake, I was coming back from the car with the camera. I was thinking about the pictures, that’s it. I didn't see you, nor anybody else. And when the police questioned you, you didn’t tell them you were by the lake before the accident? No, what for? You know the police, you give them this and they imagine that. If you want, I can tell them now that I was in the park, and that I saw you didn't do anything wrong. Now is too late, they wouldn't believe you. And we would both be in trouble. Thank you anyway. So, now you don’t believe any more that I did it. - No, you too are… handsome. - Yes! Why do you speak French to each other? It's our only common language. Cecilia is Scottish, and I'm German. - Did you meet in France? - No, in Nuremberg. In the toys street. In a store, they were selling Scottish dolls, that say “Mama” when they close their eyes. I entered and I bought Cecilia! Since then she’s learned other words, but not so many, fortunately! Oh, it looks like an accident. - No, it’s a roadblock. - The police. Yes. Get down, Cecilia will hide you. Cecilia, put my coat on your knees. Where is my coat? Oh, I forgot it at the resort. Never mind, someone will take it, it's a good coat. You… look like a folded sheet. You make it double, then again, and at the end it's small, small, small. Here we are, Cecilia, put your coat over his head. Sir, can you take a look at this picture? Have you seen this man? - No, I haven’t. - And you Madam? No, I haven’t. Then excuse us. Good evening Sir, Madam. Get out, captain! Here comes the rain. Do you want to come to our place? We have two rooms in a hotel. I'm staying at the same hotel, the next room. - But undercover. - Ah, I see. With the blonde girl who came to my room. - It's your partner. - Exactly. She's very pretty and very nice. We are neighbours then. Pleased to meet you, Johann Muller. - Rémi Fertet. - Rémi... - like Re Mi Fa… - Yes, Rémi. Now we need to find a way to get into the hotel. Let's see, let's think… You think too, Cecilia. But Johann, I am thinking! Good evening, Madam. Good evening, Sir. Good evening, Madam, Sir. Did you enjoy your trip? Yes, thank you. OK, so… goodnight Cecilia. No, you must wait for Johann. All right. But we can't get in, I don't have the key. OK, keep looking, kids. And call me back, I’ll be here. Berlier, go check next door if Muller is back. I just did, no one is there. Rooms 128 and 129, please. But, I thought I saw you going up, Mr. Muller. Then you must have seen me coming down. I had forgotten my cigarettes and the key! “A forgetful head makes a weary pair of heels!” Here we go! Cecilia, you'll be the lady of the house. Go ask the girl next door to come have dinner with us. - What's her name? - Lisette. Lisette, OK. We will order dinner. All right? Go on, and be a good girl. Go! - Hello Miss. - Hello. Are you alone? I am. You must be bored, then. Come to my place. I can't, I'm expecting some friends. OK, so you won't be bored for long. - Goodbye, see you soon. - Thank you for coming. Goodbye. Who is it? I don't know, she lives at the hotel. We just greet one another. I know who she is. Muller's wife. We questioned her on Sunday with the others. - So they’re back. - She’s not alone. - Who is she with? - I didn't see anyone. But I understood, she did like that. She got it, the darling girl! I wonder who's with Lisette, I'll go check. You're insane! Sorry, are you crazy? Don't be afraid, they won't see me. And we can drop the formal talk if you want. Come, let’s have a look. This feels good. - What a downpour. - You know it'll pass, tonight. It feels like winter already… - The rain is torrential! - It has a certain charm. Falling leaves, roasted chestnuts, kids going to school… - Indeed. - Indeed… All right then. If you don't mind, I’ll put some men to protect you. You never know, it could be dangerous. - Do you think it's necessary? - Who knows… He came to stay at your hotel and followed you to Foucherolles. That’s not an accident. He is definitely after you. There’re many reasons to believe he’ll be back. Do you know why he's been following you? Do you know him? - Do you know anything about him? - No, nothing. In any case, Mr. Muller, don’t be afraid, you can count on us. We’ll protect you. If you have any problem, just knock on the wall, we’re next door. If we don't reply, knock louder. That'll wake us up! Did you hear? My Gosh… - Yes, it's a real trap next door. - Shh! He thinks he’ll pick me up like a flower. Dry yourself up! It’ll too bad if they hear a man coughing in the room, tomorrow, when I'll be gone! Take some pyjamas in the wardrobe. You’ll sleep here. Where is Cecilia. Cecilia? - Are you calling me? - Mein Gott, I’ll have two sick people. Go take everything off! Quick! And rub yourself down! Dinner’s ready! Yes, come in! How clean they are! Exactly like two little children who just took their bath, before eating their evening mush. Cecilia, Rémi, come to eat! Let me see your nails, and your ears. Eat your soup, ladies and gentlemen. I'll take care of drying the hair of my baby number… 1. - Do you think it's necessary? - Absolutely. Can you serve me, please? - Johann, eat. - Shh, I’m working. Cecilia! You little piggy, huh? Piggy Cecilia. Or Cecilia behind her window. Boxer Cecilia. - Johann! - Sick Cecilia. No, no… Happy Cecilia. Sad Cecilia. Very sad Cecilia. Chinese Cecilia. Sad Chinese Cecilia. Very sad Chinese! Very very sad Chinese because very bad toothache. All right, Cecilia at the hairdresser. Why don't you laugh? Isn't this funny? - Are you unhappy? - I am happy. I'm good. I'm well. It rains and it rains… Do you think Rémi will go out with this rain? And how do you know he will come back here? So go to bed! And turn the light off! If you think we enjoy being here… Are these diamonds? And double, and redouble… May the winner be a cuckold! What is a criminal condemned to? Hey, I'm talking to you! - It depends. - When he doesn’t kill on purpose? - When it happens in a fight? - It depends. It depends, it depends… So everything depends. - Actually you don’t know anything! - Come on, my friend, if I play hearts, it’s not for you to give spades to these gentlemen! - I didn't have any. - But you were full! - At the beginning. - If someone surrenders… Is it less serious? - Much less. And when someone isn’t suspected and confesses, whereas he wasn’t suspected at all? Ah that's a good job, well done! - And when it's a woman? - Always less serious for a woman. - And a woman defending herself? - Against what? For her virtue, for her honour! - Can I meet her? - But let's imagine… - We’d give her an award. - And she wouldn’t go to jail? - It’s pretty unlikely… - Self-defense. This guy’s got so many spades! In that case… I thought that if you kill someone, you kill someone. - And straight to jail. - No, we’re not like that. Really? So… it's me. - Clubs. - I pass. It's me! - It's you what? - It's me, I did it! I pushed him in the lake… the victim. - Women… - Women in love. - I play clubs. But you weren't even there! Don’t talk nonsense. What do you mean, I wasn't there? That’s amazing. That's fantastic! I went looking for Rémi. He had just left. By the lake I met the guy, he made a move on me, I defended myself, and splash! In the water. And I ran away, of course. The thing is that no one saw you. But someone saw Mr. Fertet. Chloé? She didn’t see anything. She arrived much later. And if you’d done it, why would you wait so long before telling us? Because. Because I had no reason to turn myself in. I'm not a hero nor a masochist. And I didn't think Rémi would get it in the neck. Oh come on! I confess and nobody listens. - To whom should I speak to be heard? - To us but we're deaf. Come on, you could go to bed, this would all be over. And everyone would be happy. Isn’t she smart… Answer the phone. So, are we going on with this? We are. Yes? Hello? No, I said I wanted men at all city gates of Paris, until we catch him. Are you tired? Come on, let's go to bed. Here we go again, and this can happen anywhere. All of a sudden, Cecilia falls asleep. Sometimes it's embarrassing, when it doesn’t happen at home. I need to carry her out. Here, here Madam. And you, sleep in peace. You'll see, everything is going to be all right. Tomorrow, I'll speak to Chloé. Thank you, Johann. - Goodnight Rémi. - Goodnight. Good morning, are you upset that I’m waking you up? - No, not at all. - It's for coffee, later, it'll be cold. Johann left. He'll surely be back tonight. He told the hotel I'm sick, so they won't disturb me. Then we must stay here, in this room, with the curtains drawn. We'll turn on the light, and put some candles. I know, it's sad not to see the light when you wake up. You'll be able to have a look outside in the next room, very quickly. Johann said you should wear his clothes. Yours are still wet. What else… I need to tell you everything before I forget. Ah! We must keep our voices low, because everyone thinks I'm alone. And play some music. And Johann said not to worry. He arranged everything with Agathe. He'll see Chloé over there tonight. Not earlier because he has a lot to do today. Why don't you eat? I'm listening to you. I'm looking at you. But you're not looking at me. I'm ashamed. I'm ugly. And bearded. - And coffee? - I'm not very hungry. I'll make the bed. I'll help you. Kind Cecilia who makes my bed. All right, where is the coffee now? I'm hungry. - Here it is. - Rain. Yes. Yesterday in the car, Johann said: “Here comes the rain,” I found that pretty: “rain.” And last night it rained. That was pretty too. Yes Cecilia, watch me do what I've never done. Watch me act like a fool. I love you, Cecilia. I love you, Cecilia. I love you. I love you. I love you. I want to die. No, that's not true, I don't want to die. I want you to love me. No, that's not true. If you only knew how much I love Johann. I almost love him as much as I love you. I love the two of you together and even more separately because of the other. I don't know anything anymore. Are you upset, Cecilia? No. We can't do that. We mustn't. I've met a lot of women. It'd be too easy to say they were insignificant or stupid. No, they were charming, good, intelligent, pretty. They loved me. Why didn't I love them? Why do I love Cecilia? Cecilia, love me just a little. One hour, one minute… I beg you, I beg you… Please. Don't be sad, please. Not because of me, on top of everything. Cecilia, you are beautiful. You are the most beautiful. Never… I’ll never love anyone the way I love you. I want to die. Kiss me. I want you, Cecilia. I want to die. Rémi, please. No, please. I feel miserable. Leave me, Cecilia, I beg you. Don't look at me. I beg you… I beg you… I love you. Every moment I think it'll pass, things will get better. But things are getting worse and worse. Everything is meaningless. Even this. To hell with carefulness! Let the sunshine in! Why “Shh”? Haven’t you realised that since yesterday, since I met you, I don't care about anything? Police, criminals, innocents… Me… There is only you. - Cecilia! - Johann! - Already? - Yes. I didn't see Chloé. Agathe told me not to scare her, she’ll try on her own first. So, I left her the tape recorder. Johann, come to bed. - But it's very early. - I feel very tired. - But we have to eat. - No, we don’t have to. Maybe Rémi wants to eat. No, I'm not hungry. Don’t worry about me. I’ll see you in the morning. Maybe… we'll have good news tomorrow, thanks to Agathe. - Maybe. - So… goodnight. - See you tomorrow. - Goodnight, see you tomorrow. Good evening, Agathe. Good evening, Chloé. Let's go to my place. Which trap did you set for me today? - Are you still mad at me? - Not at all. You're in love, you’re all excused. We all have our own way to love. You love like a slave. Suit yourself! You’re only harming yourself. I think men like weak women. If Rémi had told you to kill me, you’d have done it, I think. I don't know. Maybe. That’s what I was dreading as I walked through your horrible park, blacker than night itself. You could have set up your car park closer to the house. Father thinks modern life people don't walk enough, and a little exercise is good for everyone. I love your father! What about your master? He runs. He hides, he's cold. - I love him. - It serves you right! Why do you want so much to hurt Rémi? You know it yourself. Because you love him? Yes. Do you do that on purpose or because you can't help it? I don't know. I want him to think about me. In one way or another. Let's talk about something else. Why am I here? What do you want? I wanted to apologize for the other day. I want Rémi to love me, you know, so I do as he says. I'm ashamed of the way I tricked you. Don't apologize. The conversation with Rémi was quite pleasant. But you remember we said we would never be nasty because of a guy. That’s what we say but don’t worry, we’ll be nasty again! Me first! I'm warning you. You look very beautiful tonight. You're not bad either. And all that for nothing. We look beautiful for nothing. Did you want to see me to tell me that? Oh, I’m thirsty. You're right, I forgot. No, I wanted to see you because I need some advice. And you're a lot smarter than I am. I want Rémi to love me. How can I do that? Are you asking me? I want him to love me or suffer. I want to take revenge on him. I’m fed up, fed up of playing open-minded! Of pretending not to be jealous, and of accepting everything, so his highness won’t leave me completely because he can't bear possessive women. I’m so, so fed up. I want him to know I'm not a sucker. But, let him rot and stop helping him. As for taking your revenge, I’ve already taken care of it. It almost sounds poetic! That being said, after some years spent in jail, he'll be a little kinder with women. Maybe. By the way, I am rather heartless, I never asked you about Olivier. Are you sad, sometimes, because of him? Yes. I liked him, but he was very possessive. Very violent. Like me. - Terribly jealous. - He must have really hated Rémi. Yes. And he always knew when I was thinking about him. He’d get mad. He hit me a couple of times. Look. It did that with his signet ring, when he slapped me. On Sunday morning he saw me talking to Rémi, and that was enough. - Did he make a scene? - He did. I wanted to follow Rémi, and Olivier tried to stop me. So I started to run, and he caught me by the lake. Then we fought, and we ended up in the water. I got out of it but he didn’t. He was too drunk. Farewell, Olivier. Would you like more champagne? Yes, sure. Love… Ok, here’s to forgiveness and generosity, for all the nasty things we’ll do again in the name of love. So, to love, slave! To love, Hermione! Hello? Room 127, please. Hello? I'd like to speak to detective Audoin. Do you feel better? You know, now he's asleep, and tomorrow he'll have forgotten it all. I hope so… He seemed so sad. I felt responsible, and selfish, for I want to keep Cecilia for myself. Cecilia, tell me, if I’d died, could he console you? If I hadn't existed, would he be… the one you’d have chosen? Maybe. Why do you love me more than you love him? Because I love you! - Miss. - Sir. I wanted to surprise the young lady. - I'm coming from the next room. - I didn’t ask anything! - Is the young lady here? - No Sir, everybody left. They figured out who did it, apparently. So they left, but the young lady forgot her hat. I'll take it and give it back to her. Thank you, Miss. Goodbye, Miss. Goodbye, Sir.
