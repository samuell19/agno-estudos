And they call me Unski... the official town mechanic! And what do they call you? Can you tell me where's the nearest bar? That white building right over there Who's that sorry-looking faggot going to the bar? Let's go kick his ass! Hello -Hello there! What can I get you? Beer-Okay?!?! There you go, one Baby-Drink!!!! Whoa, this is way too much... But I don't mind! I'll give you a handfull more if you can tell me where I can find some work! Work??? Well... you might find something if you've thought about going to the killing-business... Well I didn't come here to pick strawberrys... You didn't what now? -Never mind. Motherfucker, I couldn't stop shitting!!! I even lost the taste for leather burgers! What can I get you boys? Would you know a good place to get fucked? Well then... Would you boys like some Moonman while waiting forth at glorious day? I see we got a comedian here... And I can't even see any Prowlers covering his ass or maybe this sorry-looking pretty-boy here is one of them... It's amazing what puny fuckers they recruite these days... Come on lads don't you be picking a fight now. What a tiny bottle!!! He's got a guitar and everything... We have a Trobaudour in our midst! Why don't you play us something? I wonder if our little faggot here's got any balls at all... Maybe he's just been sucking on them... Do you know what you've done?! Those were Company men!! -I just filled out a job application Hey! Stranger! -You can call me The Man From Hervanta Would you like a hotel-room? Free of charge Well, I've seen worse What do you want? -My name is Esmeralda. The bartender sent me to pleasure you... Free of charge! Well why didn't you say so! Come on in!! The bartender was very pleased with your action in the bar tonight... And I've got to tell you it pleased me a great deal too... It seems the people here aren't too pleased with the Companys men They charge us ridiculous amounts for the electricity and generally treat us like shit! What about these Prowlers, are they any better? No way! They plague us with taxes, they're complete scum! Fuck those fuckers, right in the ear! Hey, is that your guitar?! Could you play me something? Don't mind if I do OH YOU COCKSUCKING MOTHERFUCKER YOU!!!! WHY THE FUCK DID YOU SHOOT MY CHICKENS!?! -GODDAMN IT!!! Leaving so soon? -Iâ€™ve got to go feed my chickens. Are you sure your chicklets are still alive? -Just another regular morning in Steel-Manse... Oh by the way... This is for you... Well what's this then? -It's my payment for last night. I've never had such a ride... Hehe... The other way around, for once!!! Do you want it with everything? -Yeah Here you go Stranger!! The Man from Hervanta! Come with me, my boss wants to see you! -Do I want to see him... Who the fuck is "The Boss"? My boss is Lester, the leader of the Prowlers, and the toughest motherfucker in Steel-Manse... So come on... I don't ride with strangers... The word on the town is you're looking for a job... Lester might have something for you, let's go -Why didn't you say so! Are you the one they call The Man from Hervanta? -one and only. You wanted to see me? Or did you want to see me? You're looking for a job, right? -Perhaps There you go! Come work for The Prowlers, and I'll get you whatever you want- Boose, cash, power, bitches - it's yours! That's a fair offer - I'll keep it in mind What!! You killed a Company man - there after you sonny! You're in for a world of hurt! Join our ranks - and you'll be safe! -I can take care of myself. I'll deal with the Company's men. That's what you think. Well - your on your own then. -As always. But I'll keep your otter in mind Hervanta-man! Consider that a down payment -just so you know which side is the right one to be on... -Whatever you say I guess the girl wants some more of that sweet lovin'... Esmeralda - OH FUCK!!! Kaide - George - Pick that faggot up! We're with The Company, you understand? And you killed my friend, you MOTHERFUCKER! Goddamn it, kill that fucking cocksucker! That's what happens to assholes... I'm gonna cut your fucking balls off, Hervanta-man! The Man from Hervanta! -Unski, you better get the fuck out of here or your next! ...and then Hervanta-man lucked them up beyond repair! -Did it really happen like that?! Damn straight! I axed those fuckers up into one kilo pieces and took the meat to the burger-guy! What was I gonna do, take them out for brunch?! What take them where? -Forget about it! Hey Unski, thanks man! I think you safed my life back there! -No sweat, I was going to chop wood, lucky I happened to be there! Are you in the habbit of saving strangers in distress? I think helping your fellow man is simply a part of humanity, though that consept went out of style years ago. Besides, you could get in trouble with The Company -Don't you worry about that! I'm the only cat in this town who knows how to repair weapons and machinery. I've even set the thermostat for this bar! Maybe it needs a little fine-tuning... Come and visit my workshop, I've got a little store there, strictly unofficial of course... I'll come on by later, right now I have to take a shit... -May your bowls get empty and clean! Greetings and salutations from The Company! I hope we're not disturbing your shit-break... I am Vesku, Il Duce's right hand-man, in case you don't know... and this here is Northwood M-8, a.k.a. Nortti... ...my best friend. Before the whole world caught on fire it was the best combat robot ever seen... ...made in the now baron wastelands formerly known as The United States... ...and even though it looks like an old piece of shit I can assure you it is quite lethal... ...so you better not fuck with me boy! -Why is it aiming at me?! It just registeres that your aiming at it with your lethal weapon... So you better tuck your willy in and zip up! It's a pretty weird looking thing... -Well it is cgi... Anyways! We are on The Company's official business and Il Duce wants to see you! Why would I want to see that prick he's already tried to kill me twice! Nortti!! Do you know what those molecule guns do to a human body? Neither do I cause there's usually nothing left to see! OK OK! -Grab your coat and let's get the fuck out of this shit house! The Man From Hervanta! I am Il Duce, the commander of The Company, the leader of Steel-Manse! Please take a seat You look like a man who cuts to the chase so... The first encounter was just a co-incidence, but the second one... was a sort of a test... -A test?! I just wanted to see if you're such a tough guy as everyone thinks and I have to say... You passed with flying colours! I heard you are working for The Prowlers... -I work for no-one! WRONG! You work for The Company now, and I am your boss! -I'll think about it Shut your mouth! Take what is given to you and do as you are told! Ok! From now on I'm your man! But in the future, do not fucking push on me! This is pushing! Oh fuck yeah! I almost forgot! Your first job is tonight, at the Cradle of Death! -WHERE?!? Ladies and Gentlemen! I give you the most popular tv-show in the world, THE CRADLE OF DEATH!!! Time for The Cradle of Death! -Oh yeah!! Now we'll see what the Hervanta-man is made of! The rules of the game are quite simple, two men, one ring, and only one of them walks out of it alive! So the game is very violent in nature, so little ones, it's off to bed with you! I am Hans Ruoste, your host for tonight, and beside me is Johnny Konga!! He is the undefeated champion of the last tournament, unfortunately he took some hits to the ribs so he can't fight this time... ...but I'm sure we still have a good Fight-Night ahead of us, or what do you think Johnny? -No doubt, it's gonna be a kick-ass-night! Good! Now it's time for the introductions, first up is Vladimir, fighting for The Prowlers, the crowd loves this man, and so do I!!! He has 12 kills under his belt, his Lucky Hat is legendary, oh my god... The words escape me when I think of Vladimir! ...he is the greatest warrior of all. And against him is a new fighter who has arrived just a few days ago, The Man From Hervanta... WHAT THE FUCK, HERVANTA-MAN?! ...and he has already killed some of The Company's men, what the hell is going on here, what is Il Duce plotting...? This man is a complete unknown, I know nothing about him... That fucking traitor, his fighting against Vladimir! The gong rings and the fighters start to circle each other... Who will give the first punch... What the hell, Hervanta-man! This is very disconcerning, some kind oi new technique, but Vladimir can not lose this fight, he is an awesome fighter and that swine-faggot can't... This fight is a now-brainer, I can bet on Vladimir, and there we can see the first hard strike! But what the hell is going on, I am surprised at how many punches Vladimir is taking in compared to his previous matches Go ahead, KILL THAT FUCKER!!! -Yeah, that's it The most important thing for Vladimir is to hold on to his lucky hat... What the hell! Just as I mentioned it it's off his head No, we got off with a scare this time, he picks his lucky hat right up and continues pounding away... God damn what a great fight we are witnessing here, this is fabulous, just massive... The crowd must be pleased! -Oh yes, they didn't come here to watch kittens fucking, they came for blood, guts and body parts! Is it possible, is the fight coming to an end? -Yes it's possible, no-one can take Vladimirs mighty punches... Hervanta-man is surprisingly tough but no-one can take this kind oi a beati... And there we go!!!! This one we have to... Studio, could we please see that in slow-motion again... There it goes... and there he flyes! -The Iron Fist of Vladimir knows no mercy! The Hervanta-man is down, this can only mean defeat for him... Vladimir is an awesome fighter and his oiled muscles have spoken again Fucking hell!! -Vlad is gonna win, it's all good... But look, Vladimir picks him up and throws him to the wall! -And now I bet... Yes! There is the throw kick! This must be the end of it, Vladimir is unbeatable! -This is not over, look for yourself! What the hell... -The Man From Hervanta is looking at Vladimir... And there we go, one punch after the other, Hervanta-man is beating the champion!!! Vladimir is down! Let's see this again, what a beating! -No, don't show it again We've never seen anything like this before! -Carry this swine out of the studio, throw this gerk-off out! Fuck you Hervanta-man! -This is terrible, Vladimir is down!!! Thank god, here comes the knife! The rules don't exactly allow this but that makes no bit of difference now... Hervanta-man will surely try something crooked but it won't work, way to go Vladimir! Kill that swine faggot! The wrist-cut, yeah, and next I'm sure the throat-cut, he may lose some points here but what an end forth is fight But what... what the hell is this... No!! Vladimir!! The lucky hat has fallen and Vladimir is beati! This can not be true! -God damn you Hervanta-man! Splendid, Hervanta-man! Good fucking fight! It's been too fucking long since we beat The Prowlers! I won a shitload of money! And you'll get a fair share I loved that shit! -Did you hear that Vesku, he loved that shit!! God damn I like you man!!! Stay loyal to me and I'll take good care of you! I might even get you a gun, a Laser-gun... I thought Laser-guns were forbidden! We got all sorts of treatys with The Prowlers, but you can take a wild guess if I give a shit about them... I thought The Prowlers controlled everything coming in here... -That's why we smuggle them in!!! When?! Where?! -Hervanta-man, mind your own business, take the money and have fun Hey Hervanta-man! I won a nice chunk of change thanks to you! -Hey Unski! The Prowlers aren't too pleased, I bet... Let me guess, you came for some weapons... I came to ask you about Lasers -What are they? Never heard of those They are forbidden in this town... And that's about all I know of them I know they're banned, but still The Company has them. They are smuglling new ones in tomorrow, I need to know where On the west side of town there is an old rusty gate by the swamp... that's where they bring them in I've tagged along a few times... got payed pretty well -That's what I wanted to here! Hervanta-man! You got some balls coming here... Good! Now we don't have to hunt you down to kill you I've got news for you! -Tell me, before I stick this fucking blade through your brains I'll only talk to Lester Smuglling Lasers?! I knew that fucking Il Duce would fuck me over! But how can I trust you? You fucked me before!!! Why would I come here volunterily? I'm at your mercy here. I'm not asking anything for this info, next time I will So your pretending to be spying for The Company... Brilliant... But if you fuck me again, it'll be the last time Check it out for yourself. I'll get back to you Lester. I do not trust that fucking guy!! -I don't trust anyone You see this shit?! This is how these wankers gerk us off, they smuggle the fucking Lasers in right here! Not for long! -You go around the back What in the fuck do you have in that cocksucking box?! Medicine and toys... for the children!! Wrong answer, cock for brains! Bulls eye motherfucker!! You gotta help me man! -How can I help you, I can't get over there! We're outta here! -You can't leave me! Hey guys, where is the solidarity What a bunch of fucking wankers! If that was me, I would have broken all their necks It will soon be over... Thank you, thank you. I guess fucking with us wasn't such a bright idea! -Ushma, stay still now... Hi Lester! How about that laser, you like? -Hervanta-man! Fucking A, it kicks ass! From now on, you'll be my agent! You know, like that Rambo-guy, 007? -As long as the price is right I'm sure we can work something out. Fucking A, let the good times roll! This is fucked RIGHT UP THE ASS!!! How the fuck did The Prowlers find out about our laser shipment? I'll bet my left nut that Hervanta-man is behind this! What the fuck are you doing here?! -Vesku is right. I told The Prowlers about the lasershipment Can I trouble you with one minor detail? WHY IN THE FUCK WOULD YOU DO THAT?!?!?! You want The Prowlers dead, right? I don't see how losing the lasers helps us get rid of Lester and The Prowlers... Kill that fucking fag, Vesku! I'm going to kill Lester and destroy The Prowlers... And after that you can do with this town whatever you want Vesku, wait... What do you mean you're going to kill Lester? -My coming here was no accident... I've got a score to settle with Lester I'm going to bury that fucker -You're here for revenge! God damn it Vesku, I really like this dude! So you got a plan or what? -Oh yeah. And it goes like this: I'll go to Lester and say: Lester, I've got big fucking news for you! -What is it? Speak up! Il Duce has hired a hit squad. Dozens of men are coming in to the city, armed to the teeth! And then I bet that Lester will respond: That fucking snake! We're gonna have an ambush outside the city and kill every motherfucker trying to get in here! So when The Prowlers are staking out the guys that aren't there we are gonna jump them! So when most of The Prowlers are outside the city we will assault their HQ! And I want to be there to kill Lester! That's a brilliant fucking plan mate! Fuck it's hot! Ain't nobody fuckin' coming... I wanna go home and watch The Cradle of Death! Hey guys! Look alive! There's a car comin'! Good day lads! Do you know if Steel-Manse is near here? -What do you want there? Moonshine man! I've got the trunk full of best damn liquer you've ever seen! Are you travelling alone? -No man, I've got my lovely wile Linda right here! Envy much? Erno, go pop the trunk and see what he's got in there Oh you god damn sons of bitches! We are being ambushed I tell you! KÃ¶ssi! The Company men are everywhere! -I know! And we are going to fucking kill them all! Oh hey Hervanta-man! Come in -Hi there! Came to see Lester I have to search you man. Against the wall -Of course Oh shit! What the fuck Come on I'll take on all ya muthas! I'll waste anyone comes thru that door I'll make Bratwurst out of you Come the FUCK ON BIIIIIIAAAAAAAATTCHHH!!!!!! Die you fucking baboon dicks! Die you fucks! Who's next? Hervanta-man! Great! You gotta help me man! You gerk-off! Motherfucker! I should have known it was you behind this all along WHY?! I helped you along here... Together we could have defeated The Company and rule Steel-Manse! Because ten years ago you killed my brother! Brother? Well could be... I killed a lot of people back then... After all they're only people... It was just a mistake! DIE!!! People of Steel-Manse, rejoyce! The Prowlers are finally defeated! So in honour of this glorious day we will raise our taxes, and we will raise them fifty percent! That's right, fifty percent! And if you don't pay, I promise you will receive this: Thanks a fucking bunch Hervanta-man! This is all your fault! Guy's gotta point... Before there were two gangs at each others throats, now there's one gang and they're at our throats! It kinda fucking sucks! To win this tournament of chess, I had to sacrifice a queen! -What tournament? Forget about it! Look, I made a separate deal with KÃ¶ssi. I met him a few days ago and told him: So you take your soldiers and go wait for the attackers that will never show up! -Outside of town? Right! And then you are attacked! -What the fuck? That's not good! You're all prepared and you kill those fuckers! And meanwhile back here, I kill Lester! And when things cool down, I go to Il Duce and tell him all The Prowlers have been slain! Meanwhile, you stand ready outside of town, and on my mark, you unleash hell! What a brilliant plan! I've been waiting for an opportunity to get rid of that filthy cocksucker! So you see I got everything under control! -Now I get it! So when will this happen? It will go down very soon Hervanta-man! Il Duce wants a word! It seems you have some unfinished business! Il Duce! Here is that slimy cocksucker! -Howdi Duce! What up dog? I was just contemplaining here... All The Prowlers have been killed, right? Yes sir! I got Lester last, I whammed a machete this big right into his brains! What about Lester's toughest soldier, KÃ¶ssi, did you get him? -Oh yeah! They're still scraping his brains off the wall! I guess Hell must be full now that the dead are walking the earth! Hey what the fuck did KÃ¶ssi have a twin? Shoot him! -Shut your mouth! Take it easy man, Il Duce knows all about the deal you and I had, but you didn't know me and Duce also had a deal... Now that Lester is dead I rule The Prowlers and we will do some great work with The Company How long do you think it will take before Duce whacks you and finds another chump to lead The Prowlers? I think that isn't your biggest concern right now... Ever since you came in town you've been jerking us both off Did you honestly think I was going to let you get away with this? DID YOU?! I didn't think so, I knew it! -You hear that? He still thinks he's gonna live through this! God damn I like this guy! -Hehe, he's a funny guy! They're aint fuck all you can do to m... -Well we'll fucking see about that! The Man from Hervanta! I've been dying to see you ever since I saw you fighting in The Cradle of Death This is gonna be so much fun... -You come here often? Don't fuck around! Shut your mouth and do as your told! Il Duce said you need to suffer... Plenty... Let me go now and I won't kill you -Stop fucking around! That's a good little boy... Let the fun begin! You'd like to have some of this eh? Take a good look 'cause you're never gonna touch these beauties! But instead... I'm gonna cram this right up your ass! A moment ago it was in Il Duces ass! Hervanta-man! It's me, Tender! That cock-ass threw me in jail -Who Tender? Tender from the bar! Bartender! Il Duce wants all liquersells to himself, so he got rid of the competition What a fucking asshole! Thanks! I now a way out of here, I used to work here We can get out here! -You go. You've done enough. I'm going to take care of Duce That's suicide man! Come with me -No, I have to go now that Il Duce thinks I'm in his chamber ls there something else I could do for you? -No. You've done enough They stole my bar, put me in jail and made me drink a pint of Vesku's piss! I wanna kill, I want to do something All right then! Go in to the city and start a proper riot! -Don't worry, I'm on the motherfucker MOONMAN!!! So what the fuck do you want? -Moonman! It said outside you serve to mutants too We got a special kind of cocktail preserved just for mutants! Guys! This ones got Whiskey, rhum and tequila... not to mention syanide and sulphur acid! Drink you fucking whore Does any of you motherfuckers got some fucking complaints?! Another mutant, huh? Take that hood off and show me your cunt-face BARTENDER!!! You are supposed to be in jail!

Motherfucker shit fuck ass!!! -All the spices? KÃ¶ssi! There is a riot going on downtown! -I can fucking see that from this monitor... Why the luck are you still here? Get over there and kill everyone! -What about Hervanta-man? OK. Unski! My old friend... Welcome to the party! Good thing you came. All the meters are on red and I have no fucking idea what to do Where the fuck is Il Duce? -Fuck you! Where the fuck is he?! -He's in the control room in level B -Thank you! But where the hell is level B? The Hervanta-man has disappeared! Sound the alarm goddamn it! Where are you?! Where the fuck is Level B? -Fuck you I aint tellin' u shit! Where in the devil is it?! -OK OK it's upstairs. -Thanks! Fuck fuckety fuck! -Let's do some death! You just can't hit me can you? You came to face your death Alter today all will be changed... Except that the strong will always kill the weak Tomorrow I shall rule Steel-Manse again! -You forget one thing... Tomorrow you'll be dead! KÃ¶ssi! Don't move! We have always got along... But the town is in revolt! And I need a forklift and a Laser! And I'll shoot you in the back if I have to Slowly put the Laser on the ground next to the wall and keep your back to me Pissing me off... Seriously fucking pissing me off And here we go! Ohhoh... That was the reverse One thing I don't understand... Why the fuck did you come back after you had killed Lester? My work here was not finished! Ten years ago you killed my father! Do you want me to kneel and beg for mercy? -No. I want you to die! Get the fuck out of the way Unski! Not a bad Hologram yeah? -You're a Gay-gram! What Gram was it ha?! Breakfast is served. YOUR TESTICLES!!!! This will be quite interesting! This is almost the joy of my life... ALMOST!!!!! I'm gonna shove this wrench right up your ass!! I hope you enjoy eating through a straw. Get up! Goddamn you Hervanta-man! Give my regards to Lester! I'm still alive! -The Man from Hervanta! UNSKI! -I'm still here! Steel-Manse! At last the city is free. I killed Il Duce! So what's next Hervanta-man, are you staying to rule the city. -Can I still get on tv? Get outta here bartender, I'm interviewing Hervanta-man! -Oh come on I gotta hear cut for this! Do you know where Unski is? He saved my life -That's impossible! He drove into Nortti and blew up What's next, will you stay and rule us? -Here is a man to lead you. The Bartender! A good man. Do you have what it takes? -Well, I can drink and fuck! Well that's a damn fine start! -OK Bartender our new ruler, what will you... The Man from Hervanta, where are you going? What will you do? -I'm going for a beer! Hervanta-man moved on. His next stop was Mega-Hellsinki, where he avenged his mother's murder. Then founded the Finnish Empire and made it the first post-apocalyptic superpower. It would flourish for a thousand years. ...but that is another story...
