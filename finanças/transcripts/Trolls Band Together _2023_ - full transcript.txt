One minute to showtime. BroZone, BroZone, BroZone. BroZone! BroZone, yeah! We love you, BroZone! All right, guys. We're gonna open with "Girl, Baby, Baby" and close with "Baby, Baby, Girl." Wait, no. That doesn't sound right. Ooh! I got it. Open with "Baby, Baby, Girl," close with "Baby, Baby, Girl, Woman." Yes! We are gonna make boy band history tonight. -510. 511. 512. -Love it, Brother. I wanna see a hundred more of those by showtime, Spruce. Those abs need to be poppin', baby. Oh! Come on. God, I wanna boil an egg on those abs. John Dory, do I really have to keep wearing these things? Yes, you do, Clay. They're funderdrawers. It's underwear, but 76% more fun. Let's see those dance moves, Brother. Fine. Rusty Robot, into Wiggle Worm, end on Caliente Puppet. Yeah. Bro, you look stressed. Breathe. Well, of course I'm stressed, Floyd. It's the first show of the tour. We have to hit the perfect family harmony. -We promised the fans. -Okay, calm down. You're making Baby Branch nervous. BroZone! BroZone! What? Nervous? No, no, no. He's not allowed to be nervous. He's gotta be perfect. Cut him some slack, John Dory. It's his first show. Come on, abs. Hey, Branch. How you feeling? I feel like I'm gonna barf and pass out and-- Pee your pants all at once? How'd you know? Ah, you got the pre-show jitters. Completely normal. Everyone gets 'em. You wanna know what I do when I get 'em? Barf, pass out and pee your pants? I remember that I'm with my brothers, and that when we come together, there is nothing that we can't do. But no one's ever hit the perfect family harmony before. Is it true it can shatter diamonds? Yeah. It's that powerful. All right, boys, just remember, no matter what you do, follow my lead. Or maybe, let's just go out there and have fun together. It's just so much pressure. Ten seconds! A-And what happens if we can't hit it? Oh, that's not an option. If we can't hit the perfect family harmony, we aren't perfect. And if we aren't perfect, we're nothing. Just follow my lead, and the harmony will happen. Let's bro! Ladies and gentlemen, here they are. The heartthrob. The fun boy. The sensitive one. The leader. And the baby.

This used to be fun. Now it's all about being perfect. You know what? I'm done playing the heartthrob. My exquisitely chiselled, rock-hard abs and I quit. I quit too, and you can keep these.

It's my fault. I ruined everything. N-No, no. Branch, this is not your fault. We're not in sync. We've gone from boys to men, and now there's only one direction for us to go: the backstreets. But not you, Floyd? You're not leaving too? Not forever. I'll be back. I promise. But right now, I-- I have to follow my heart. It's telling me that it's time to start a solo career. But what am I gonna do? Branch, you are gonna do the most important thing of all. You're gonna… take care of Grandma. Oh, come on, Branch. Let's play some rummy. But I won't let you win, because I play for the money. You might have to let her win. Occasionally. When you miss me, you can wear this. It'll be like I'm right here with you. And when you come back, we'll make our hideout. Definitely. Wow! Is that a ten-story water slide? Yeah. That's how we shower. Well, we better keep this in a safe place.

I was just listening to some of her old records. BroZone? No way. I love BroZone. Really? I mean, really? I didn't know you liked them too. I don't. I'm actually hate-listening. It's a new thing. My grandma had very questionable taste. I mean, just look at how she decorated this place. I'm sorry, but there are some things that shouldn't be macraméd. Am I right? Um, kinda seems like there's something you're not telling me. -What? Pfft. Be silly. No. -Hey. I need you to be real with me. It seems like more than a macramé issue. If you're having feelings, you can talk about them with me. Okay. You're right. Oh, hey. Look at the time. We're gonna be late to the royal wedding. -Let's go get married. -Branch! What? I mean, let's get Bridget and Gristle married. Yeah… Oh. 'Cause it would be weird if we got married. -Yeah. So weird. Duh. -Wow. The weirdest. Ha.

I don't have a sister, so I wouldn't know. Which is fine. It's something I'm coming to terms with. Slowly. Uh, Poppy? Can we maybe unpack the sister thing after the vows? Aah! Yeah. No. Of course. You go get him, girl. Before I do. Oh. Like a beautiful angel sent from heaven. Hey, Bridget, you still have time to run for it. Very funny, Aunt Smead. I'm so glad you could make it. Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to celebrate the sweet, sweet love of Bridget-- hey, girl-- and Mr. Yummy-Tummy himself, King Gristle. Now, falling in love is easy. We've all done it. I've done it a hundred times. Thousands, even, if you count that semester I spent abroad. Stop the wedding! Uh, Bridget, do you know this guy? I can't remember all my suitors, Grissy. Sorry, is this bad timing? I'm just trying to find a troll named-- Baby Branch! Uh, you're making a mistake, stranger-that-looks- similar-to-me. There's no Branch here. Look at you. You got so big. You're not a branch anymore. You're more like a trunk. Junk in the trunk. Ow! I bet you I can still pick you up. Come on. -Ooh, you got heavy. -Aah! There goes my back. Oh! Charley horse. Oh, God. Two charley horses. Hey. Stop right there. You put my boyfriend down. Tell us who you are and what you want. -Ow. -Hey. What up? You're right. Totally rude of me. Didn't introduce myself. I'm Branch's brother. What? Ooh, drama! Corn me, Dinkles. Correction: Used to be my brother. Not anymore. Hey, um, remember earlier when I said you should open up to me and be real? Well-- You could've started by telling me you had a secret brother! -Former brother. -That's not how DNA works! Dad, did you know about this? Huh? What would I know about secret family members? Oh, my gosh. I was being so rude. I've never met anyone from Branch's family before. I'm Poppy, Branch's girlfriend. Should we hug, fist-bump, smile and wave for now and see where the night takes us? All of the above. Wait, I know you. You're the guy from BroZone! We were just listening to them. Yeah, BroZone! Wait. Wait, wait, wait. Don't tell me, um… Okay, well, you're not the heartthrob. Well, that's your opinion. I-- The fun one? No, you're kind of uptight. Uptight? Hmm. Not the sensitive one either. Okay, a lot of assumptions for someone you just met 30 seconds ago-- Oh, oh! I've got it. You're John Dory. -The leader. -The old one! Uh, sorry to interrupt, but we lose the venue at 11:00, so-- Shh, I'm trying to listen. Very hot gossip. So, if-- if you're Branch's bro, then that means that all the other BroZone bros are Branch's bros too. Branch, how come you never told me? Because it's complicated. Oh, sweetie. 'Cause you weren't in the band. Branch was in the band all right. What? No way. Which one was he? -Bitty B. -Bitty B? No, that's impossible. -Bitty B had glasses. -Oh, and a diaper. And a falsetto made of gold. Not that anyone cared. But that's all in the past. Because they stopped being my brothers the day they walked out on me and never came back. Whoa, whoa, whoa. That's not fair, Branch. I did come back, but no one was there. It wasn't until I heard about you saving the world from the rock apocalypse that I realized you were even still alive. Oh, that's-- That's so sweet. He realized I was still alive. Twenty years too late! Hi. Sorry. He gets hangry if he skips breakfast. I had breakfast. It was avocado toast with two poached eggs, some cayenne for a little kick. And you know what? It was delightful. Branch, what's going on with you? The question we should be asking is, what's going on with him? I bet you he's only here because he needs something. That's not true. He's your brother. Branch, I'm gonna be straight with you. I need something. And there it is. Come on, man. I'm trying here. Wait-- Wait. Hold up, Branch. It's about Floyd. What do you mean? He's in danger, man. I hadn't heard from him since the band broke up. -Until… I got a letter from him. "Dear John Dory, I'm being held against my will by superstars Velvet and Veneer. Come to Mount Rageous at once and bring our brothers. Love, Floyd." I didn't know where any of you were, so I went to Mount Rageous alone. I found where this Velvet and Veneer were performing that night. ♪ Sweet dreams Are made of this ♪ ♪ Who am I to disagree? ♪ ♪ I traveled the world And the seven seas ♪ ♪ Everybody's looking For something ♪ -♪ Hold your head up ♪ -♪ Movin' on ♪ -♪ Keep your head up ♪ -♪ Movin' on ♪ -♪ Hold your head up ♪ -♪ Movin' on ♪ -♪ Keep your head up ♪ -♪ Movin' on ♪ ♪ Traveled the world And the seven seas ♪ ♪ Yeah ♪ And there was Floyd. Yo, Floyd! John Dory? I can't believe it. I never thought I'd see any of my brothers again. I'm gonna get you out of here, bro. No, you've gotta get out of here. You don't understand. Velvet and Veneer are giant, pop-obsessed succubi with no talent, and they've been stealing mine. And they'll be back any minute for more. What? That's even worse than lip-synching. Not my brother. Not today. John. John. Stop. The bottle is made of diamond. And there's only one thing that's powerful enough to shatter diamond. Right. A diamond-shattering diamond hammer. Where can we get one of those? No, John. It's the perfect family harmony. Of course. The perfect family harmony. Our voices sound like garbage. We are dying out there. What we need is more troll. Run, John Dory. Save yourself. Don't worry, Floyd. I'll be back with the bros. You have my word. Floyd. So, you came here to get the band back together and sing the perfect family harmony. -Yeah. -Oh, yeah. So we can attempt to sing something we've only tried once and failed so miserably at that we broke up and never talked to each other again. -We are so in. -What? Uh… Could you give us a second? Huh? Okay, what are you doing? This is your second chance with your brothers, Branch. It's not that easy, okay? You don't get it. You don't have any siblings. That's my point. Branch, you are so lucky to have a brother to fight for. I mean, if I had a sister… …it would be so perfect. We'd be best friends and we'd teach each other things. We'd never fight, we'd have each other's backs. We wouldn't talk 'cause we'd think the same thoughts. Everyone would ask us if we're twins, and we'd be like, "Well, not technically"-- -Poppy. -But… if she were ever in trouble, I would do everything I could to help her. I would show up. Okay, listen. If there was a brother that I might do this for, and I'm not saying there is, it would be Floyd. I'm not hearing "no." -Yes! Works for me. -Yeah! BroZone 2.0. BroZone reunion. BroZone, here we bro again. BroZone, where'd they bro? I don't know. We're gonna find them. Whoa! Hey, looks like our ride's here. Here she is! Ooh. That's coming out of the deposit. Meet Rhonda, y'all. Ain't she a beaut? She's, uh, really something. -Um, I guess she likes me? -Yeah, she does. Or she's marking you as prey. Can never quite tell with Rhonda. Uh, guys? If you don't mind, I really cannot wait another minute to marry this gorgeous specimen. I now pronounce you husband and wife. Okay, all aboard who's going aboard. Bye, everybody. We're getting the band back together. -Bye, Poppy. -Bye, Poppy. Have fun, you crazy kids. Have an awesome honeymoon. -Thanks, Poppy. -I love you guys. -Peace out, Poppy. -See you later, Poppy. Beep-beep. Today on a very special episode of The Bop on Top, we're talking about overnight superstars, Velvet and Veneer! ♪ Never gets old ♪ ♪ No matter how much I'm told I'm amazing ♪ ♪ You're amazing ♪ ♪ You gotta work hard To make it look easy ♪ ♪ You gotta live fast To keep making that money ♪ ♪ If you want to be As famous as me ♪ ♪ You gotta work, Gotta work, gotta work ♪ ♪ Watch me work ♪ So, what do you wanna know? -I'm an open book. -Wide-open. We're gaping novels. Okay, well, who are some of your biggest influences? Honestly, Vel's always been my inspiration. My biggest inspiration? Mmm. I'd have to go with also me. One thing's for sure, after two months on the scene, the superstar duo will receive the prestigious Lifer Award. That's celebrating a lifetime of achievements. Be sure to catch their performance this weekend at the Rage Dome. Last question. How do you guys stay the biggest superstars Mount Rageous has ever known? -What's your secret? -Secret? We don't have a secret. Who said we have a secret? What my calm, casual-sounding brother means is it's simple, really. It just takes lots of hard work and loads of natural talent. If we're gonna make it through the Rage Dome show, we're gonna need more troll. Crimp, what are you doing? Why are you always hovering? Uh, I'm standing. Well, be a good, little assistant and go stand in the corner. Oh, yes. Um, oh, dear. I think this is kind of a c-corner. Okay, I cannot with her. -It's really too much. -Whoo. Well, time for a spritz. No, please! I barely have any talent left to give. I mean, maybe like a desperate Christmas album or a one-off national anthem performance, but that is it! Oh, really? You don't wanna? Okay, that's fine. We'll just kiss our careers goodbye and focus our efforts on charity. Good one. That's more like it. We're so close to having everything we always knew we believed we deserved to have! Veneer, what's with your vibe and your face? Why do you have resting-moody-vibe face? No, I know we've deserved to be famous just 'cause we want to. But honestly, that dude looks rough. -He's fine. -And he's getting pale. And not in like a stunning, Victorian way. Don't you see what you're doing? You're literally sucking the life out of me. That's what I tell Crimp every day. What are we gonna do? We obviously can't rely on this troll to get us through this dress rehearsal. Let alone the Rage Dome show. It's all going to change as soon as we have BroZone. -BroZone? -Yep! I forged a letter begging for them to come and save you. I love me. No! You leave my brothers alone. Ugh. I'm exhausted by this drama. Hey, do you wanna go buy a yacht? Oh, good idea. Let's buy matching yachts. ♪ This is for All the lonely people ♪ ♪ Thinking that life Has passed us by ♪ ♪ We won't give up until We drink from the silver cup ♪ ♪ And ride that highway In the sky ♪ Your ukulele skills are improving. Thank you. Operation Family Harmony is on and popping! -What? -What? Oh, nothing! I just-- If I didn't know any better, I'd-- I'd almost say you were excited. It has nothing to do with my brothers. All right. All right. Tiny, Branch, Poppy, this random dude… What? …on another musical adventure filled with heart, hilarity and happiness. Tiny! What are you doing here? Well, Aunt Poppy, for your information, I am no longer a baby. I am a big boy now. And I'm on a man-sized rite of passage to learn lessons of life, courage and maybe love. Aw. Should we be letting a baby drive? Not to worry, fellow grown-up. I have procured my learner's permit. Who is Adulty McManface? The better question is, are you a narc? What? No. No. Why? Are you? Enough chitchat, Adulty McManface. Step on it! Okay, guys, where was I? We gotta find our brothers and fast. But don't worry. Old Branch's got it handled. All we have to do is follow the clues. Wow. Check out your old outfits. Puffy jackets. Puka shell necklaces. Denim tuxedos? Branch, did you have frosted tips? Yeah. It was an era. Don't forget his perm. No way! Pictures or it didn't happen. Look at you! You were so cute. I love it. But we had to pull the plug when he tried to frost his perm. -It was an era! -Tragic. While you two are strolling down memory lane, I'll work on finding Spruce. I'm gonna need copies of that pic. Wallet size. Listen, baby brother, we don't need your little board to find Spruce… -It's not little. -…because I got this! Ha! Booyah. A postcard that says, "Wish you were here"? That's it? It's not even signed. It's definitely Spruce. I mean, he's the only one I know who talks that way. There's no return address. It's blank. This could be from anywhere. We can't find Spruce with this. Yeah, we can! All we have to do is find this sunset. Liking that optimism, Poppy seed. Branch, one word. Keeper! Hey, man. I know about being treated like a baby. But while it's just the two of us, -you want some of this? -Nah. Thanks, man. I-I can't get back on that train. Suit yourself. I mean, hey, look at this. We're never gonna find Spruce with this. I bet this sunset doesn't even exist. Oh, hot dog! Oh, man. Of course. Hey, guys! You're gonna want to see this. I knew we'd find it. Spruce must be on that island. Whoa, easy there, goggles. All right, y'all. Let's mobilize! Yeah, pedal to the metal, JD. -What are you doing? -Worry not, friends. Rhonda here's completely waterproof. Oh, Grissy, this is the most romantic honeymoon I've ever been on. Ever. Whoo! It is a night of surprises! To the water park! Whoo-hoo! Good old Rhonda. Completely waterproof, huh? So, John Dory, who wrote that song "Girl, I Love Your Love, Girl"? -I did. -Cool. Who wrote, "Girl, You Break My Heart, Girl"? -I did. -So cool. Who wrote, "Girl, I Love Your Love, Girl, You Break My Heart, Girl, I Still Love You, But I Seriously Think We Should Have A Talk About Our Relationship, Girl"? -That was Branch. -Shut up! That was my favorite BroZone song, like, ever. JK! Also me. Branch has never written a song. I was a baby. What did you want me to write about, diaper rash? Okay, take it easy, Bitty B. Hey, what's wrong? Nothing. Super happy. This is our most fun mission yet. Yay. Branch, do you know how lucky you are? A brother is a friend who can never leave you. It's the strongest bond in the world. I would kill to have a sibling to sing with, Branch. Ha! Yeah, well, you can have mine. Okay. Fine. Poppy, wait. Grown-up stuff. Am I right? You know, I've still got that thang, if you want it. Whoa, whoa. Don't be waving that thing around. All right, y'all. We're getting close to something. I can feel it. Whoa. What do we got here?

Hi, Spruce. I'm Poppy. Wow. It's, like-- It's so cool to meet you or whatever. This is Tiny Diamond. Hey, what's up? Killer nachos you got here, by the way. -Yeah! -All right! Okay, Spruce. We're here because Floyd-- No one's called me Spruce in years. I go by Bruce now. I'm sorry. Did you say Bruce? Yeah. I wanted to put the whole boy band thing behind me now that I'm a dad. Wait a minute. You're a father? Yeah. I can't wait for you to meet everyone. Hi, honey. These are my brothers, unexpectedly. Oh. Oh! Oh, hello there. So nice to finally meet you. -Hi! -Hello. This is my wife and business partner, Brandy. She is my soulmate. My very tall soulmate. But we make it work. How? We don't even really know how it works. I'm kidding. I'm-- I'm not. I'm-- I don't know. Daddy, Daddy, can I have a cookie? Becoming a dad was like a-- like a seismic shift in my brain. -Daddy, Bruce Jr. bit me. -No biting. Daddy, I don't see how any government stands a chance. You're not wrong, kid. I'm stuck in this ketchup bottle. Okay. Gonna handle all of that. Just give Daddy two seconds, okay? Love you. As a dad-- Daddy, Daddy, Daddy! Guess what? I have pink eye. Oh, my-- Pink eye. Oh, Look, Spruce, gotta cut to the chase. We're not here to catch up. We're here because we need to hit the perfect family harmony. Oh, no. You're still going on about that? Hey. Get these guys their meals to go. No, no, no. You don't understand. It's for Floyd. He's being held captive. What? Well, then, what are we waiting for? We need to call the authorities. Hit the perfect family harmony. Spruce, it-it-it has to be us. Floyd's being held captive in a diamond prison. Oh. Well, yeah, you need the perfect family harmony for that. Exactly. Wait. But how? We've never even come close to pulling it off. You do remember our last show, don't you? If we practice, I know we'll be able to nail it. We have to. At my age? I really don't think that-- See, guys. I told you Dad wasn't in a band. Oh, I was in a band. I was in the band. You ask your mother if I was in a band. Oh, he was in a band. Prove it! Prove it! Prove it! Prove it! All right. I'll-- I'll prove it. I'll prove it right now. -Yes! Bring it in, Brother. -Go, Dad! Branch, get up there. Go sing with your brothers. I'll do it to save Floyd when I have to. But I'm not doing it right now just for "funsies." Oh, yeah. Okay. You're probably right. No, no, no. You're the one who-- Wait. What did you say? You're afraid that singing with your brothers again after all these years will overwhelm you with emotions too powerful for you to handle. I agree with you. I don't think you can handle it, so I think you shouldn't do it. I think I can handle singing a song. Prove it! -Prove it! Prove it! Prove it! -All right. Fine.

Listen, we don't want any clown-related trouble, okay? We're just here looking for our brother Clay. Wait a second. You're trolls? So what? You're a clown. Whoa! Oh, my gosh. Hello! My name is Viva! It is so "fantastamazing" to see other trolls. Hi! Ha! So, "fantastamazing" is my own personal word. It means, um, fantastic and amazing. I used to say "amastic," but then I was like, "Hmm, that's not as good." "Fantastamawesome." That's different, but that works too. Way to make it your own. Is this how people feel when they meet me? -Yes. -Am I being a lot? Sometimes I can be a lot. I'm not sure we're in the right place. Course you're in the right place.

Come here. -So, Clay, this is Poppy. -Hi, Clay. So great to finally meet you. Can you do the Rusty Robot for me? Yeah, no, I don't do that anymore, okay? Right. Kidding. Ha! Can you imagine? I wouldn't ask you to do that after meeting you two seconds ago. Who would do that? Yeah, it's just that Fun Boy Clay is dead. Serious Boy Clay only does the Well-Oiled Robot. And it is no… …fun. I mean, that's still pretty fun. Yeah, same old Clay. No. That's not true. If I was still fun, would I have chosen the admin building as my bedroom? Huh? Huh? Asking the tough questions, guys. -Asking the tough questions. -Oh, right. Anyway, I can't believe you all are here. Wait, where's Floyd? That's why we're here. Floyd's been taken prisoner in Mount Rageous by superstar singers Velvet and Veneer… And the only thing powerful enough to free him is the perfect family harmony. Okay, either they just made that up, or I have not been paying attention. Well, why haven't you just called the authorities? Oh, unless Floyd is being held in an impenetrable diamond prison. -Yeah. That. -I'm in. I'd also like to volunteer to keep track of our expenses. Just 'cause I think you're gonna need somebody to be on top of that. Yeah, I don't think you'll get any pushback on that front. Great, but we need to leave for Mount Rageous, like, now. You can't leave now. You just got here. Come on. Let me show you around. Hug time! -Uh… -Yeah, no. Aw, so cute. Where'd you get that hug time bracelet? My dad gave it to me. Okay, this is so totally random, but I used to have one just like it. Can I see that? Wow. It fits you perfectly. Yeah. Whoa. I'm sorry. What did you say your name was again? I'm Poppy. Poppy? Okay, um, another totally random, weird question, but is your dad King Peppy? Uh, yeah? You're-- Oh, you're-- you're alive. -I'm alive. -This is unbelievable! I never thought I'd see you again. Again? Poppy, it's me, Viva. Uh… I'm your sister. My-- My what? Your sister. Your hermana! Whoa. Hey, man. Am I the only one without a long-lost sibling? What do you mean, we're sisters? H-How could I have not known about you? I can't believe Dad didn't tell me I have a sister. -That is… -…so Dad. Oh! I ca-- I can't believe this. I've always dreamt of having a sister. I was just saying this. Wasn't I just saying this? This means we can plan each other's birthday parties. -Yeah! And weddings. -Yes! My best friend had her wedding, and it went off without a hitch. I was the best maid of honor. You'd be the best maid of honor. You and Bridget are gonna love each other! I'm gonna love her. -I love what you love. -Yes!

But, um-- But just to circle back real quick. I still have a million questions about what happened. I used to live at the Troll Tree. I was there when you were born. And you were so cute. Kinda like you are now, only teensier and weensier and-- Do you wanna make candy necklaces that we never finish -because we eat all the candy? -Obviously! But, Veev, I'm just gonna need you to focus here and-- and tell me everything. Why am I only learning about you now? What happened? We got accidentally separated. And I've lived here ever since. The end. Wanna do candy toe rings next? Uh, accidentally separated? Viva doesn't like to talk about it. It's too painful for her. But she's been here ever since the night of the great Bergen attack. Viva, are you talking about the night the trolls escaped Bergen Town? Oh, yeah. Yeah, I guess it was that night. Not everyone made it out of that tree. Some of them got trapped by Bergens. They were this close to getting eaten… …until Viva and some of the other trolls fought them off. But by then… the tunnels had collapsed, and they were cut off from the rest. I kept screaming, "No troll left behind!" But when I went back in, the tunnels had collapsed. That's when I found Viva's hug time bracelet. Viva found this old, abandoned Bergen golf course and transformed it into this troll utopia. We formed this little sanctuary of survivors. I added fire exits. She added her heart and soul. I've thought so many times about leaving, you know, to look for you and Dad, but it's not safe out there. I know I should've told Poppy, but my heart was broken. I felt like a failure. Not just as a king, but as a father. I feel so guilty. What do you think I should do? I'm afraid that's our time for today. But I just revealed a major trauma. Okay. Obviously this is a lot, and you should be able to open up about this on your own time. But we'll have plenty of time to work through this on the way to Mount Rageous. Whoa! I am not going to Mount Rageous. And neither are you, silly. You're never gonna leave again. Wait, what was the-- What was that last thing? Okay, guys, if we're gonna save Floyd, we need to get going. I'll go get Poppy. No, no, no, wait. Hold on. There's no way Viva's gonna let her go. What? W-What are you talking about? Like I said, she's got some stuff going on, man. If we don't wanna get trapped, we should sneak out now. Oh, hey… …Viva. What's up, girl? Viva! What are you doing? You're not leaving here no matter what, because-- because it's just not safe out there. You're welcome. Wait, is this about the Bergens? Because they stopped trying to eat us. That's all in the past. Yeah, right. That's hilarious, Poppy. I'm laughing really hard. I'm serious, Viva. Bridget, my best friend I was telling you about, she's a Bergen. Look. Bridget and I do a million fun things together. We talk and we play games and we sing songs. And make up these really bad dances. It's a lot like-- Well, actually, it's a lot like what you and I have been doing. The world's a lot different than it used to be. Viva, look, I used to be just like you. I built a bunker, and I lived in it for years because I knew it was safe. And, sure, i-it kept me alive. And I never had to wear pants. But I was living without pants. Does that make sense? Well, I feel judged. You don't understand. I just got my sister back. I'm not gonna lose you. For anything. Clay? I'm sorry, Viva, but we have to leave. I don't wanna lose my brother either. Let's move! No. No, Poppy, wait! Poppy, please! I want you to stay! Viva, I can't do that. But you can come with us. And I know you think it's risky, and maybe it is, but it'll be worth it. Family's always worth it. No, no, no, I-- I can't. Knock, knock. Almost showtime. Ugh. No sign of BroZone? No. But I have an idea. We could practice. I wanna be famous, but I'm not gonna work for it. Ew. Come on. We used to make up little dances together all the time, remember? Hip, hip. Twist. Flip. Our dances sucked. How many fans do you think we can get making up sucky dances? Hey, hello? Hello in there. Wake up. Wakey-wakey. Oh. He's dead? Oh, man. What have we done? What do we do? You remember the goldfish you had as a kid? You mean Sparkles? Mkay. Goodbye, little guy. Please, hurry up and flush. Being this close to you next to a toilet… …makes me uncomfortable. Wow. I thought ghosts just floated away. Well, don't just stand there. Go get him! Why does it have to be me? Because Crimp's locked in the closet. Now, go! Help! Help! Help me, please. Help! Gotcha. Please, Veneer, just let me run past you. You can pretend you never saw me. It-- It'll be our little secret. I can't. I know. Velvet would kill you. But just because she's your sister doesn't mean you should let her treat you like garbage. -Doesn't it? -No. Sibling or not, you deserve to be treated with kindness and to be around people who would never try to change the you that you are. You got him. Hey, I know I probably don't say this enough, but good job. We really make a great team. Don't we, bro? Now, come on. We should also probably hire a new assistant, which feels like a you job. Crimp! Hire us a new assistant! I'm on it!

If this diaper was any smaller, I could taste it. That's why I don't wear one of those. It's a hard fit to pull off. Really great note, John Dory. Super helpful. Thanks. Thanks. Now I have a creative note for you. -Stop being bossy! -What? I'm not being bossy. I'm helping us be better. No. No, dude. You're forcing us to be perfect, just like you always have, so we can hit the perfect family harmony. Yeah. For Floyd. Is it? Or is this all just so you can tell people what to do again? -Wha-- What? -Guys, guys. This isn't helpful right now. Let's all maybe take five, huh? This isn't gonna work if you keep on being the same old John Dory. Yeah. We've all changed. Bruce settled down. Branch is slightly taller, with zero glasses. And I'm a licensed CPA. Put some respect on my name, fool! Well, I'm not allowed to change. I'm the oldest. I had to be the leader. You love bossing us around. Just admit it. Why do you think I moved to the middle of nowhere? So I didn't have to be in charge of anyone. Four little brothers is a lot of responsibility. Why do you think I left? So no one would treat me like you did. -You know what, Spruce-- -It's Bruce! Thank you, Clay. Guys. We can't forget about Floyd. Look, Branch is right. We're here for Floyd. Let's just get this done and we can go our separate ways. Fine. Wait. What? What? The mission's the mission. You didn't think we'd all live together when this was all over, did you? Singing songs and roasting marshmallows? Oh, I'm sorry. Is that funny to you? That I might want us to actually be a family again? Tiny Diamond, pull over. Now. Don't be a baby, Branch. You're mad at him, but you guys do the exact same thing to me. You all still treat me like the baby of the family. But guess what? I stopped being a baby the day you guys walked out on me, 'cause I had to. Then Grandma got eaten, and there was no one else to take care of me. This time, I'm walking out on you. This is Branch's bunker. He built this for you guys. I didn't know. I guess you never asked. Wait. Grandma got eaten? Branch, wait! Branch! Where are you going? To save Floyd. Alone. I didn't need them growing up, and I don't need them now. What-- What are you doing? What do you mean? I'm coming with you. Why bother? Aren't you gonna leave me eventually anyway? Everyone else does. I have been by your side from the moment we met. And you've been by mine. Let's give each other some credit here. Right. Uh, I'm sorry. Thank you. You're welcome. And I'm not going anywhere. Unless it's with you. To save Floyd. Tiny! You're coming too? Hey, what can I say? I was moved by Branch's speech and his sad, sad drawing. Now, let's roll. Wow, Grissy. I've never seen anyone get kicked out of a water park like that. All right, for the record, it was the water slide that ripped off my trunks. Ooh, so hot. Wait. Do you smell… French fries! French fries. Ew. Who goes there? Putt-Putt. Putt-Putt. Putt-Putt. Are those golf balls? Putt-Putt. Oh, good. They're just trolls. Look how cute. What's happening? Ow! Grissy, I didn't think we'd both find ourselves tied up on this honeymoon. All right, look. Security is really tight. So we're not gonna be able to just walk right in. You know what that means. We're scaling the walls. We're huh? Doing what? When? We should plan to make our ascent about 200 meters east of the entrance. Good thing I brought extra gummy gloves. I'm tired. Carry me. You have to walk on your own, Tiny. You have to be a big boy. But my feet hurt. I don't wanna. The quickest way in will be at the roof. The HVAC system. -Ooh. I love how you say HVAC. -Thank you. But we'll have to bypass the fan blade, so that our cupcakes don't get sliced in two. -Ooh! We brought cupcakes? -No. Not what I meant. It doesn't matter. After that, we need to cut the power, so we can move freely through the interior air ducts. How do you know which wires to cut? I don't. I'm just blasting everything until something turns off. Hello? From there, we'll have to do some exploring, but we'll find Floyd in one of those rooms. Look. There he is. Come on. Floyd. Branch? Is it really you? Yeah. It's really me. Wow. You've really grown into that vest. You're a man now. Oh! Finally, somebody gets me. But you need to leave. Right now. No, Floyd. It's okay. We're here to rescue you. No. This is a trap. Velvet and Veneer, they-- they lured you here. You gotta leave before they come back. Hurry! No. I'm not leaving here without you. Branch, please. -Do it for me. -We're so close. I told you BroZone would show up. My letter worked. I'm a genius. Are you sure you're sure about this? Oh, no. Oh! Ow! It's biting me. Put it in the closet. Put it in the closet! Hello. -Floyd! -Brothers. It's so good to see you. We would have been here sooner, but these guys wouldn't stop yelling at each other. Guys, please. John Dory, you're the one who parked in the spot marked "Reserved for BroZone." Didn't that seem a little sus to you? -Oh, so it's my fault? -Oh, look. They're even cute when they fight. -Boop, boop, boop. -Hey. Stop. What are you doing? Come on, man. You're better than this. Well, thank you. I really don't see why you're so upset. At least we're putting your talent to good use. I mean, you're welcome. What? You're sick. You mispronounced, "Thanks for not letting our talents go to waste anymore, Velvet and Veneer." Come on. They're waiting for us on the red carpet. Let's go autograph some butts. Oh, that's fun. I'll grab my butt marker. Oh, it looks like you need a hug. Okay, now, whose sibling is this now? Bergens! Bergens! Bergens! Bergens! Bergens! Bridgey, loving you is the best thing that ever happened to me. Um, would it be weird if we made out? Babe, it would be weird if we didn't. Wait! Is this you? Hey. That's me and my best friend. Yeah. Poppy. She-- She's my sister. You're Poppy's sister? That makes us best friends too. Yeah. She told me about your wedding. -Congratulations. -Thanks, girl. I think I made a huge mistake. It's fine. We're not gonna press charges. I don't think that's what she means. Yeah, no. That's not what I'm talking about. So, you're really not gonna eat us? No. But I understand the fear. If you want, I can open my mouth and you can take tiny steps toward it, letting yourself feel and breathe your way through the anxiety. It's called systematic desensitization. Or I let you go, and you promise not to eat us. Oh, that's fine too. All right, Rageons. Now is the moment we've all been waiting for.

I'm gonna have to repossess your yacht. Fair enough. Prison it is. Wow, this is liberating! So, how you feeling? Happy. Grateful. And… really sorry that it's taken me this long to open up to you. Whoa, TMI! Boundaries, my man. That is a lot of feelings. -Um, what just happened? -Oh, that. Viva just braided your hair. It means she likes you. It means I like you. We're gonna have the best family reunion ever. And a big, long talk with Dad. King of secrets, that guy. Right? What is his deal? Oh, he's gonna be so happy to see you. Hey, Viva, do you wanna make candy necklaces that we never finish because we eat all the candy? Great minds think alike, Daddy. -Oof, looking good, Bruce. -You bet. Hey, down. No pulling out Daddy's chest hair! Ow! Kids, cover your ears. You look hot. Honey, break a leg. Branch, I'm sorry we didn't get to see you grow up, but I'm excited to get to hang out with you now. Yeah, same here, Clay. Hey, you wanna join my sad book club? It's really cool. We just sit around and hug and stuff. And cry. Yeah, totally. BroZone! BroZone! BroZone! What's up? You got the pre-show jitters? I can't believe that we almost missed out on all this. We may not be the new kids on the block anymore, but I'm loving this new edition of us. You know, I'm really glad those 98 degrees of separation are behind us. Just as long as we're together. Mmm. Hey, you guys gotta try this menudo. Guys, are we sure this is the place? Well, it does match the postcard. "Wish you were here"? Branch is the only one I know who talks like that. Oh, here we go now! That new song is sick, Branch! I knew you had it in you. Oh, yeah, thanks. It's, you know, just a little something me and a few of my buddies were working on. What? Hey, here they are now. What? You didn't think BroZone was the only band I've ever been in, did you? Please. Now, these guys know how to flex the drip. You are so in sync. Did you hear what he said? I don't get it.

That was a lot of fun. And then I got to drive the van. That was cool. So then we got locked in the mini golf course, and there was a giant clown head that started talking to us, man. Too crazy. But I'm enjoying the journey. I'm enjoying the journey. I'm growing. I'm developing. I feel strong every day. But, you know, I thought I was ready to be a man. But I'm gonna keep it baby for a while.
