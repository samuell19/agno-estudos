No he's not. Grandpa! What are you doing? Leave the dead people in peace. Grandpa. My grandpa... We are grandson's from Trifun. We bring you your grandson. My Cane! Didn't I tell you that he will come? I bought a icon. Did you bring the wife? Jasna Nikolic. Let me see you. Beautiful, beautiful... People! Are you crazy! We have funeral here. What are we gonna do with the dead man? The man is dead, he will start to smell now! One second... God can't wait. Yes he can. Everything will be alright. Hey Boldie, who are you? Who are you to stop the funeral? Do you know that funeral has advantage on the road. Who the fuck are you? Should I shoot them all? No, no ... I'll do it myself. One by one. What's this boss? Shoot a little, to scare them. Run, run... What's this Cane? Criminals are chasing us. Criminals... For me they look like fascist. Third world war. Second one is not over yet. What will be... My friend, this smells like provocation on a large scale. I think this is only a small incident. You said the same when Hitler attacked Poland. Hitler has attacked Poland because of hate, and today's force is graceful, she kills from love. No, no not like this... This is not the old war, don't... No, please this is my wedding. Women and children in church, hurry! Music , play! You two, go in the church! Grandpa, I?m not a child anymore. Do you want to marry? I didn't ask her. We will ask her. Friend, bells! Please, because of a couple of bullets we're going to ruin the wedding. People, what are you doing? Where are you going grandpa? Friend order me to ring the bells. Why the bell is ringing? It's good that is ringing twice, then people are happy... Sound's like it's ringing three times. It's all about how they ring. They can ring five times, nine times, just not once. Bells are ringing for us. Priest, remember where did you stop. I'm just gonna finish something. He's coming, don't worry... People are you gonna fuck around, or get married! Boss... Wild pig... Run! Now... He is here! Do you Zivojin, take Bosa for your wife? Yes! Do you Bosa, take Zivojin for you husband? Yes! I pronounce you married. In the name of the father, the son, and the holy ghost. Amen. Fucking bastards! Stupid farmers! I pronounce you man and wife. Angel! Does anyone know the results from Italian league? All this smells like big provocation... #Translation by Rizlafabrika.
