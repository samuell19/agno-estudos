DON'T EVER OPEN THIS DOOR Based on two stories by William Irish SOMEONE ON THE PHONE. ANGUISH. Ah, no, no, no my baby. No more looking at the clock. A little more mambo here, then to the Russian tavern, violin and caviar, and then, in the early hours, to the Pompadour, with champagne and roses. Great, what a night. Whisky for everybody, no soda, please. Whisky again, what a lack of imagination. What do you want me to ask for in The Congo, an alligator? That's talking, alligators not even in shoes. You're tireless. For me a party doesn't start until sunrise, - or do you feel like sleeping? - I'm tired. I'm a working man. Listen to him? These boys became fathers too soon. Don't try to fool me saying you're a busy man. You were born an old man. But a beautiful, old man. You're right Nelly, you're getting too serious. It's the responsibility. Till my people come back from Europe, ...I'm head of the family. Yeah? You'd better take care of her. Maybe they stole her from you. - What do you mean? - Isn't that Luisa? As we can see, she likes serious men. Gentlemen are that way, the more mature the better. That's enough! Won't you talk of something else? Sorry, boy, it was just a joke. - Shall we dance? - No. But I will. Let's go? No, please. No jewels. I assure you, this is a real diamond. Maybe, but I don't like to deal with things I don?t understand. It's not a payment, it's just a guarantee. You'll have all the money in less than a month. On your word. I swear on my life. Excuse me a moment. Luisa! What are you doing here so late? I guess it's the same hour for both of us. - Who's that guy? - Anybody. Can't I have a friend? A friend doesn't make appointments at night and in places like these. - I have the right to ask. - Not in that way. I'm old enough to know what I'm doing. Don't worry about my friends and you go back with yours. Good night, Ra?l. - Where are you going now? - Home. - Should I go with you? There's no need, I'm able to walk alone. Luisa! Luisa? Hello? Hello? Hello? Who was it? Nobody. Can't you see? Obviously a wrong number. How many times did it ring? I don't know. Do you think I waste my time counting them? Why did you ask me how many times it rang? It doesn't matter. That was an stupid question. Yeah, really stupid. Enjoy yourself? I expected to find you home when I got here. I came slowly, just walking. It was so hot. Hot? Let me see. Let me your hand. You're burning. Are you ill? No, don't be silly. You're so strange these days. There's something wrong with you? Don't you think that's enough questioning? Alright. I don't want to mess around in your life. But if there's anything wrong, you should tell your brother. Nobody has ever loved you like me. Sorry, Ra?l, I'm just nervous. Listen, Luisa. Do you remember when we were kids? Once, playing battleships in the swimming pool... you almost drowned and I saved you. From then on, whenever you were scared, you called me shouting. Help, Captain! - And your Captain never let you down. - Why do you remind me of that now? I just wanted to tell you that if you're in trouble and need any help your Captain will be always with you. - Alright? - Alright. - See you tomorrow, honey. - See you tomorrow. Just like that? Thank you, Ra?l, thank you. No. Not like that. On your marks, sailor. At your service, Captain. That's it. Hello? Yes, it's me. I couldn't tonight. No, no, no, please. Not now. I can't stand it and I'm scared. And my brother is here. Yes, tomorrow. At your house. Till tomorrow. - What's that, Mar?a? - A telegram. Luisa! Luisa! Telegram from Europe. Don't you hear me? Wake up, lazybones! - What's wrong with you? - Nothing, I couldn't sleep. I've taken two pills. I'm a little dizzy. There's something wrong? - On the contrary. Father is coming. - When? - Last night they took the plane. Tomorrow morning they'll be here. We've gotta organize a party, just like a honeymoon. Aren't you happy? Of course, three months away. Take a cold shower and take care of everything. I'm going to the bank, it's pay day in the factory. Breakfast, Mar?a. Excuse me, Mr. Vald?s, there can be no possible error. I've checked your account and it's canceled. But that's impossible. Two weeks ago there were more than 70.000 pesos... and I haven't signed any cheque. You're not the only one authorized in that account. Your sister is also authorized. My sister? Not only has she emptied the account but it's 10,000 in the red as well. Take a look. Is this signature authentic? I'm sorry, I thought you'd received our notification. - Did you send it to the factory? - To your house. Excuse me. Good morning. - What have you done with the money? - Me? What money? I've been to the bank. You've taken all the money out... and have gone into the red. Why? - For whom? - Let me go, you're hurting me. Aren't you hurting me? What am I going to tell our father when he arrives? Take off that glove. - Where's mother's ring? - I've lost it. Last night in the club, that man. Is it him who's bleeding you? - How can he? - I tell you that man is a friend. A friend? What power has he over you to oblige you so much? Because it isn't love, that's for sure. Fear is what you have. What's going on between you two? Answer me! Answer me! I didn't expect it from you, Ra?l. You see how desperate I am and that's the way you help me. Can't you see that's what I'm willing to do? To help you. You have gambled again, haven't you? And you have lost a lot of money. What else? I didn't know what I was doing. I signed everything he wanted me to. I was afraid, do you understand? Afraid of the scandal, of our father. That's blackmail. The bastard! - Tell me his name right now! - No, no, please. Luisa! That's it. That's his code. To be sure you're alone. Three... Four... Five... Then he hangs up. A few seconds of silence and then phones again, right? - You're fancying it all. - Your question last night gave you away. Do you think I didn't notice? But now, when he rings again... you're going to answer in front of me. - Leave me alone. - You stay here with me! There he is again. Answer it. - No. Alright, I'll answer it. Please Ra?l, you don?t know what he's capable of. Hello! Hello! This is Valdes, her brother. Talk, talk, you coward! - Talk! - That's enough, Ra?l. You can't do anything. I'll fix this matter, do you hear me? By myself. Luisa, wait! Luisa. Let's be reasonable. Listen... - Mr. Valdes? - That's me. What can I do for you? - Don't get excited, please. Your sister... - What's the matter with her? Do you want to talk to her? She's in her room. No, Mr. Valdes. Your sister isn't there. Luisa! Luisa! LUISA VALDES Aged twenty. Single. Do you suspect any reason? Any illness? - Love affair gone wrong? - Nothing. She was a healthy and happy girl. Happy... But... She didn't kill herself, he killed her. What do you mean? Nothing. It's my business. Last night he was here with a girl. - They all come here with girls. - An old man, grey hair. - Who's been at this table? - An old client. He waited an hour for someone who didn't show up. That person won't be able to come. I'm here in her place. Do you know... where can I meet him? If you're so interested, ask the cab drivers, they have dinner at the bar, round the corner, near the garage. Thank you. - A jealous man, isn't he? - Woman matters, for sure. Full! Really? Don't you remember? Mister, I take two hundred passengers a day. Do you think I recall all of them? Maybe you'll be more interested. There are 100 extra pesos for the one who recalls the address. Do you recognize these cigarettes? Macanudos. Last night a passenger gave me one of them. - Is it him? - Him! Remember where you took him? 100 pesos improves everyone's memory. Just a moment. - Is it far? - On the other side of the river. - Do you remember the exact address? - No, but I know the place. A gambling house, isn't it? - Go on. Say man, is it a police matter? I wouldn't want any trouble. Don't worry. I'm just want a bet myself. - Good night and thank you. - Good luck. Good evening, I come on behalf of Luisa - Luisa? Which Luisa? - Luisa Vald?s. Can we talk alone? Come on in. In fact I'm alone. - Even better. Come with me. Women. I do her a favour out of pity, and instead of thanking me she leaves me here waiting. That's Louisa?s ring, isn't it? I hope it's authentic, she gave it to me as guarantee of a loan A loan? Is it what they call it now? Each one earns his living the way he can, not the way he'd like. Why hasn't she come? I've been phoning her but she doesn't answer. She couldn't. Luisa died this morning. - That's not possible! - On the contrary, it's so easy. You don't realize how you can kill a woman... ...little by little and from a distance. Through fear. Through anguish, until she goes mad. But this time, the woman wasn't alone. What are you doing? You're crazy! I came here to give you back your telephone code, remember? Five times... then hang up. One... Why? I only helped her... Two... I swear you're making a mistake. Three... But why? Four... And five. I know this is no use. But it was the only thing I could do. Rest now, sailor. No... No! No! Enough! No... THE SINGING BIRD COMES BACK HOME. PAIN. This story should only be told in two dimensions, touch and sound. Sight has scarcely any part in it. Nonetheless, we shall try to tell it also for the eyes. Good evening. Mrs. Rosa Quincal? - Yes? Who are you? - A letter for you. For me? You must be mistaken. Nobody ever writes to me. It's clearly written on the envelope. Is it here or not? A letter... For me? Should I pay anything? - No, madam. Good evening. Good evening, boy. And thank you. A letter! Mar?a! - I'm coming, Aunt Rosa, coming. It arrived at last! Open it! Hurry. It must be from him, Daniel. Who was going to think of me? Open it. Yes? - It's type written. - What does it matter? Is it from him? Why have you bowed your head? Because it's not from him, Aunt Rosa. It's from the bank. I see. It was too good to be true. - Shall I read it to you? - What for? That's him. It's been eight years now and he's never written to me. His father was that way too, crazy about running around. Women and ships stole him from me when he was young. But one day he returned, old and down-and-out, a nobody ever stole him from me again. Only death. - Who moved the chair? - I'm sorry. You shouldn't move anything from its place, dear. I'd get lost in my own house. Being near you, one forgets about your eyes. You do everything with such confidence. Hands and ears are enough. Turn on the radio, dear. Daniel loved music so much. - Could he play an instrument? - Just the harmonica. But he didn't need it, he sang like the birds. Where are you, crazy boy? I'm not asking for you back. I know this village is small for you. But a letter at least. Just a letter, dear. - Just a moment, please. - Alright, sir. - Do you want to see anything else? - There's no need. I'll give you my card. Send it to my hotel this afternoon. I'm sorry, whistling is a bad habit but I can't help it. Good afternoon, sir. Goodbye, sir. DON'T SHOUT OR EVEN MOVE. MY PARTNER NEVER MISSES A SHOT. You swines! Why are you in the dark? - Do you too want to learn? - I didn't notice. I was thinking. How do you tell day from night? It's another kind of shadow. Cooler. And when I read the letter, how did you know I bowed my head? By feeling the direction of your voice in the air. I hope you never have to learn these things. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Once again, an unusual crime shakes our city. The crime took place in broad daylight in the center of the town. In Farmer's antiques shop. An elegant young man, of good appearance, aided by two accomplices, treacherously killed the shop owner and escaped with valuable jewellery. A few seconds earlier the merciless criminal was smiling and whistling a well known song. He was the singing bird, my listeners. The killer whistles whilst he's working. The song he was whistling was Tango One, his favourite melody. Don't forget it, maybe you'll hear it again. How many time are we going to stand for this villainous criminal? - How is he? - I think he's had it. That's all we need. If he'd only be quiet. - Is it far? - Is he so bad? The sooner we get there the better. It's said that after they bring bad luck. - Aunt Rosa... - Quiet, dear. - Is something wrong? - I like hearing the trains going by. On one of them ran away my Daniel. And on one of them he'll return. But trains come and go, and none of them stop. Are you expecting anyone? Nobody. Just my imagination. I hope one day we could put three places. - Now there's a car. - They don't stop either. They just pass by closer, but still pass. Not that one. It's stopped at the door. No! Sometimes they ask for water for the engine. Open up! Not that way! Shoulder it, idiot! - That voice... - Quiet. - Open the door. Hurry up! - Daniel! Open it! Be careful. Turn off the light. Come in. That way. Carry him upstairs. The last room. Is the barn still in the yard? Come with me, we've got to park the car. Son... Just a moment, Mother. I'll be back soon. At last, you're safe. At last. How are you, Mother? Mother, is that all you've got to say to me? Later. Now there's too much to do and I'm tired. Damn night! - Who's she? - Your cousin Mar?a. Don't you remember her? She hasn't forgotten you for a single day. Mar?a? The brat has became a woman. - Aunt Rosa! - What's the matter? There's blood on my apron. It's from the car seat. We had an accident and our friend is wounded. There's a good doctor in town. - We can call him up. - We don't need anyone. We'll take care of him. Hot water, hurry! - I'll take it. - You just heat it up, I'll take it. Hurry up! What are you thinking of? Come on, tell me. Nothing, son. I've lived eight years imagining this moment And it was all so different. That's life. The rest is just fairy tales. - Will you be staying long? - Just for tonight. - Let me see you. - See me? With my hands, just like before. You don't look the same. This deep wrinkle between your eyes. This hard expression. - And this? - It's nothing, a fight. Take no notice. That fancy world you dreamt of. You have suffered, haven't you? - I've lived. - Forgetting your home. That's enough, Mother! The past is done. There are more serious things to do. - The water. - Give it to me. You'd better forget everything about tonight, d'you understand? Whatever you say, son. It must have been a serious accident. The car is holed and the windows broken. An accident? Sure, what else could it be? - I'm afraid, Aunt Rosa. - Why? I don't know, but I'm afraid. Terribly afraid. Come on, dear. That's what I thought. Infection. - Let's see if the cauterizing works. - And if not? We can't either take him with us or leave him here. You won't have to worry much longer. I think this settles itself. Leave him alone. We are also made of flesh and bone. Juan, my partner. My mother and cousin Mar?a. It's a pleasure. Pleased to meet you, Miss. Congratulations. With a girl like that, I wouldn't be long away from home. My friend is hungry, put another plate, Mar?a. We've already had dinner. Then one place more. That's right, son. One place more. The girl seems nervous, Could she have seen anything? Women always see everything. Even without eyes. For God's sake, don't whistle that way. I whistle when I'm nervous. Don't you like music? Not tonight, no. - Why must you sit so far away? - I always sit here. Say something at least. There's a guest in the house. - Are you angry, Mother? - I don't like the way you call me Mother. - Before, you'd speak so differently. - Alright. To your health, Mamma Rosa. Alright? - Alright. Thank you. Upstairs! - Why? What harm has he done to you? - Who? The cat. He's my only friend. Sorry. Daniel! You two go to your bedroom and stay there till I call you. Now the other's coming down. When he went upstairs the steps didn't creak so much. It isn't one coming down, Mar?a. - They're two. - Quiet please. It's too late to be quiet. Now we must face the facts the way they are. Look at me and answer . What's the name of that melody? - What melody? - Come on, face it. The melody Daniel was whistling. - I don't know. - You do. Answer me. I swear I don't know it. Then I'll tell you. - It's the criminal's. Isn't it? - Aunt Rosa... No tears, Mar?a. Tonight we'll also have many things to do. We've done more for him than he would have done for us. It's been a great solution, one less for splitting. My God! I have blisters. Maybe they'll mistake you for a working man. Go to bed right now. Lock your door and don't be afraid. Hi, young lady. Going to bed without saying goodbye? If you need something, you need only call. - What are you waiting for? - Nothing. What's wrong with looking? - Do you have anything to drink? - It's in the cupboard. If you feel sleepy, don't let us keep you up. Sorry, I was leaving. Don't get me wrong, we have business to discuss. What business? Still thinking of the other robbery? A little lower. Blind people can hear through walls. Forget all that stuff. I just want to be on the ship as soon as possible. Why not kill two birds with one stone? In that bank every fool in the village keeps his money. I've known the place since I was a child. - I could draw it with my eyes closed. - But after today's robbery? - Precisely. The police think that after a robbery like that, we always take a holiday. - Alright? - Alright. Let's sleep, tomorrow we must be up early. - Where do I sleep? - Upstairs. Come on. Are you crazy? The dead man's room? It's not an hotel to choose. Come on. No shouting! As friends, whatever you want, but not this way. Let's go. Juan! - And if she wants? - I am here. There's no use getting angry. She's just a woman. I said, let's go! - Who's the boss here? - Alright. If the girls' yours you just had to say. Good night, boss. Don't be scared, it's me, Mar?a. Open the door. Get dressed in the dark and listen well. Tomorrow they've planned to rob the local bank. All those poor people save everything they have there. - We must prevent them from robbing it. - We? You can drive. It'll take you 10 minutes to get to the gas station. Tell them to come armed, and come back with them. Hurry up! - But Daniel is your son. - No more. This isn't the life I taught him. - But they could kill him. - That's not the worst. His father is dead but still he's mine. Now, go to the kitchen and take out the fuses. Hide them and come back. I'll be by the front door. It's done, Aunt Rosa. Now we're all the same. Everyone blind! Hurry up, dear, and be careful. Try not to make any noise till you're far away. Daniel! Daniel! Daniel! Juan! I've been locked in and they have stolen my gun. Mother! Mother! Daniel! I found the dead man's gun. Damned old lady! No! - The manipulating... - She's my mother. My son is fighting for me. For me. All is not lost. Who is it? Son. Forgive me, Mamma Rosa. Let me out. I swear that this time... I'll take the right road. May God go with you... Son. - Aunt Rosa. - Too late. Here there's only one. He's dead. And the other? Which way did he go? She won't tell. She's his mother. Yes, I can tell. My son has risked his life for me. And now he has taken the right road. The right road. The only one.
