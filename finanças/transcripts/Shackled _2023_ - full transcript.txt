I overheard some of your conversation. Are you okay, honey? Yes. No, I'm, I uh, I'm injured, and I, I'm chained up. [Police Officer] Aamal, Aamal, are you okay? Yes. Yes, I mean, I'm okay. I'm here. [Police Officer] Honey, I know it's hard, but I need you to try and stay focused for me, okay? Can you do that? Yes. [Police Officer] The man that you were talking to on the radio, is he the one that's hurting you? Huh, uh, no. I'm, I, I mean, I don't, I don't know. [Police Officer] He's the one that locked you up? Uh, no, I-- No, I, I don't, I don't know. Maybe. He said he was trying to help me. [Police Officer] Aamal, I need you to listen to me very carefully, all right? That man is a bad man. Don't trust anything he says. What, what, what? Why are you telling this right now? I have a, I have a husband, my daughter. [Aamal crying] [Police Officer] I need you to stay calm. Are you able to do that? Aamal, please, you may not have a lot of time. Because of that man, women have died. Okay, okay, I'm here. [Police Officer] I'm going to help you Aamal, okay? But you gotta help me first by answering some questions. Do you remember what information you shared with him? Did you give him any details about your location? I don't, no, I don't, I don't know where I am and I... he didn't ask for anything. Um, I just told him that I uh, I told him I felt like someone was toying with me. [Police Officer] Good girl, that's good, that's good. Do you think you can describe your surroundings to me? Can you see any street signs or buildings, landmarks? Um, I'm uh, I'm, I'm by a, there's a valley. It's like a really, it's like a really big valley, and um, there's mountains behind me. It looks like I'm surrounded by mountains and there's uh, I see some big boulders. Oh, a field. I don't know, does that help? Does that help at all? -Yeah, that's really... -[radio buzzing] [Police Officer] That's okay, hun. What about the topography? Any little detail helps. Anything else stand out? Um, uh, oh, there's a uh, it's a, one of those oil things. Like a, a pump jack on top of the hill and it's blue. A blue pump jack. [Police Officer] Great, great. Is there anything that might be considered unique about the truck? Um, yeah, um. I'm, I'm uh, the truck, it's a, it's a, it's a blue pickup truck. It's kind of like an older truck. And um, I don't... [Police Officer] Very, very good, Aamal. Very good. What about the license plate? Are you able to see it? Um, I, I can, I can check it. Let me, let me check. [Police Officer] I'll be here. [tense music] [ominous music] [tense music] [Broadcaster] Aamal, Aamal, are you there? Pick up, please. Aamal, listen, pick up, please. Are you, can you hear me? [ominous music] Hello? [Broadcaster] Aamal, Aamal, is that you? Thank goodness. I was worried I'd lost you for good, girl. Now listen, I made up my mind. You're asking me for help and I'm gonna help you no matter what. Why are you doing this? [Broadcaster] What do you mean? What do you want? [Broadcaster] I, I don't want anything, Aamal. I just want to help, help you out, and help you out on those chains and home free. Now listen to me, you know, you said you don't know where you are, but maybe you can tell me what, what do you see around you? There's a lake and uh, a lot of trees. [Broadcaster] Oh, so you're not near the valley? No. [Broadcaster] Good, good. That's a relief. There's terrible stories I could tell you about the death shadow in that valley. At sunset when the air is still, I hear it creep from yonder hill. It breathes upon me dead and chill. A moment and it's gone. Nasty stuff. But uh, nothing for you to worry your pretty little head about now. What, what about, what about your truck? That truck, what's, what's it look like? Oh, it's a black truck, newish. [Broadcaster] All right, good, good, good. I, I reckon there's only one or two places you could be. I should be able to get to you at no time at all. Thanks. Thank you, that's great. [Broadcaster] Good well uh, now what [radio breaking up]. The truth shall set you free. I have a true story for you. When I was a little girl, I used to stay out in the desert with my Aunt Toolie. My Aunt Toolie had a little dog, Princess. Only dog I ever loved, actually loved. I woke up one morning, went to the kitchen, and I found Princess dead. And you know what had happened? A scorpion stung her. So my Aunt Toolie, she comes in, she finds the scorpion. Scorpion's right there under the table. So she picks up the scorpion by the tail and she drops it into a one of those glass aquarium things. And then she picks up a little mouse. It's a tiny little brown mouse, and she drops it into the aquarium with the scorpion. I start, I start freaking out. Aunt Toolie calms me down and she says, "Watch." I'm sitting there and I'm watching, and I'm watching this scorpion sting this mouse over and over again. In the face and the body, it's all over. And you know what? That little mouse kept fighting and fighting. And I sat there and I watched that mouse kill that scorpion and eat it. [Broadcaster] That was a good story, Aamal. Listen, I'll see you soon. [radio buzzing] Hello, is anyone there? Hello? [Police Officer] I'm here, I'm here. I heard everything. I didn't know what to say, so I lied. [Police Officer] You did good, honey. You did good. You did what you needed to do to protect yourself. Did you get the license plate? No, but I found a VIN number. [Police Officer] Smart woman. I'm ready when you are. It's um, K-E-1-16-V-10-42-1. [Police Officer] Very good work, hun. I'm gonna be able to get an associated name and address with this. Aamal, do you copy? Yes, ow. [Police Officer] Aamal, are you okay? Okay. No, I'm, I, I injured my leg. I was, um, I shot myself. Well, I was, I was trying to shoot the chain and I got some shrapnel in my leg, but I was able to um, stop the bleeding. [Police Officer] You have a gun? Yes, it was here. He left it for me. [Police Officer] He left it? When I woke up it was here on the hood of the truck and there was some bullets on the glove box. [Police Officer] How many bullets do you have? I um, uh, I have one. I had two but um... [Police Officer] Is the gun there now? Yes. [Police Officer] Your leg, how's it feeling? It hurts. [Police Officer] Anything else? Uh, injuries, pain? I'm thirsty. I'm thirsty. Do you think you'll be here before it's dark? It's just, he said something about a death shadow and at night I, I think I heard something. [Police Officer] Listen to me. You're in pain, you're exhausted, you're dehydrated, you're feeling confused and afraid. You are suffering. It's not fair and it's not right. Is it okay that you're not okay? Is it okay that you miss your family? [Aamal] Yes. [Police Officer] No one wants their loved ones to suffer. [ominous music] They're better off without me. [Police Officer] Oh, honey, do you mean that? I feel so lucky that you found me. What's a cop doing on a CB radio anyway? [Police Officer] I've been monitoring the radio channels for a while trying to stay one step ahead of him. Once I have an address, I can take that info along with the description you gave me of your surroundings and narrow it down to your location. These radios only have a 15, 20 mile radius, so it won't be too long. How long? [Police Officer] Minutes. Thank you.
