It's a pig - just look at his arse. Make me a coffee, will you? Is this old fart your boss? Yes, that's Boris! He's not short of the wind... Why do they call you Johnny? They call me that, because I have no tits and a big ass... Ahd you? Krassky, but call me Kras. Kras, what a stupid name! She's funny, this little one! Where is the bog? - What? The Toilet? Outside on the right, beside the pump. Who's smoking the cigar? It's Boris. But he doesn't smoke?! Right! Old fart!!! Look what you're doing... Can't you be careful? ...Idiot! There's a dance on Saturday night in a hangar... You've got to come! Might do! Go on, make fun, skinny bones. This is for you. I think it's got a cute face! Is it a friend for my dog? You don't feel good? Oh... I see, it's that bastard! Do the shopping!!! It's going to close. Yes... There are days, when he gets on my nerves. Come on... Hurry up!!! Hi, Pepe! - Hello, Jo!

You are really disgusting! Do you hear what I'm saying? What I hear is your farting all the time! And so what? I've got the wind! It's the champagne... Anyway, I've warned you! Are you going to move, or what? What do you see in that idiot? Imagine all the vaginas that have sat on these! Shut up! I'm going to throw up! What time do you finish? Midnight or one, it depends... ... Boris said you're homosexual?! Old fart! That's not an answer! Shit, stop! And now we present the amateur stripteasers! Are you allowed to dance? - No, but I will! What are you doing with that, jerk? You're tough, are you?... ... Got balls, eh? Come on, don't cry! This is all your fault! I'm fed up! I want to go back to Italy. I want to see the old girl before she dies. You'd go back to your stupidities... ... and end up in jail. That's what would be waiting for you there... Ahd you know that! Ah!!! You hurt me! What's new? Johnny, did you turn off the percolator? - Yeees! Is that the pump? Leave it, I'll do it. I'm taking you out tonight, OK? Your boss should be doing this with his bottom! Are they girls? Yes, as much as you are a man! Love is blind and has a long pink cane! What's wrong? Nothing... nothing! Come on... tell me? I can't, that's all! What do you mean, you can't? I can't... I'm sorry Johnny! That's it! I don't please you, then? I don't know why you brought me here... ...So, Boris was right... Poofter... Poofter... Will you shut up?!!! I'm a boy! Marcell!!! Open the door! What is it? What do you want? A girl was killed in that room, the police closed down... ...the motel for six months! - Do you understand? I don't want problems. You can't stay here! And take the girl with you! What a shit! Whores always screw in silence! Don't play with that, Krassky! Listen, Padovan... You're boring me! Even worse, you piss me off! But what have I done to you? I don't understand! Cut that shit!!! That bitch! I know what you are looking for! ... You want me to stick it up your bottom!!! But I better not, with that big thing of mine! I've sent more than one to the hospital... and the police... ... and problems, I don't want to know any more! Do you understand? Goodbye... Illegal impersonification of an officer! You know what you could get... ? I don't give a damn. They belong to my father, he won them in war! Ah, hero! Did you sleep with Boris? Are you crazy? That fat pig? You are sick! Shit, I've got something in my eye. - Let's have a look. See, it's gone now. I bet it's gone. It will be gone with the first tear. Why do you want to leave me? Kras is working in the shithole... ...I find that pretty, this mountain of shit... ... it's the nausea of cities, the vomit of mankind... ... the source of the Styx... The what? - The River of Hell, dum dum. ... people in Greek mythology, who were not buried were... ... condemned to wander on its banks for... eternity. You are really smart! Anyway, what a job? You pick up scrap... ... and then put it somewhere else. And so what? When men die, we put them somewhere else. There! I'm dead. Take me away. Yes, where? I don't know, we'll see! Come on, get up. Oh no! You are going to hurt me again! OK, you stay here, sit and be a good boy! With you screaming... we'll never make it! It's not my fault. It hurts me! Let's have a swim. I don't have my costume! Don't worry! - But I can't swim! No problem! Look! Who is coming! Nana, doggy woogy... You know what are we going to do now? I'll tell you. We're going to stay here until the sunset. No, I can't. I have to get back, Boris will sack me!!! Old fart... You see! ...Life is like that - bitter. Do you think so? I don't! It depends what you expect from it! Tell me... ... the name like that?! It's not American! Polak!!! Ah, those Slavic eyes... But why do you always look so sad? There are some days, when I don't give a damn. When I was a kid... ...my dream was to drive a locomotive... ...you know, the steam engines. Nowadays, they are all electric! That's stupid, isn't it? You're wasting your time, darling! Krassky doesn't like women. Oh. Yes? You see what I mean? Listen to me very carefully... You little shit!!! For Kras ans I... ... it's our last job in this area. We are leaving this rotten place, we are moving on... Do you understand? Hey you, you poof! Leave her alone! Mind your own business! Climb into your hole and stay there! Watch it, darling, or I'll kick your ass! Stop it, both of you! You know, I like you... ...You smell of Negro, I love that, it turns me on! Oh... How strong you are!!! You weirdo! Shut up or I'll smash your face in! I'll get you for this! He's a bastard... and his friend is the same. Leave him alone, he hasn't done anything to you! Oh well... I just think you should be careful! Above all, that one... he is jealous as hell. It's my problem, not yours. What's that? - What? That costume... what is it? But you told me... - What did I tell you? I told you to dress, that's all. But, I'm a woman! OK, get into the truck! Oh, what a luxury. I love you... ...I love you ... And you? Do you love me? A little bit, at least? IN MY MIND IT DOES NOT MATTER WHICH SIDE I TAKE YOU FROM!!! It's a mixture... ... a synchronous bout of epilepsy... ... believe me it's rare. That's LOVE, Baby! Is that you Boris? I said I will get you, little bitch... ... look at yourself... ... like a chicken from the market. You... poor bastard! I just wanted to frighten her, that's all! Why don't you hit him. - NO! Go on... hit him! What are you waiting for? What difference would it make, look at him! He tried to strangle me, and that's all you say? Don't touch me! Listen Johnny... You disgust me!!! Fuck off!!! Poofter!!! OK! Padovan, let's go! I don't want you to leave! I didn't mean to say that! I didn't mean to say that!
