I love the lyrics so much, I actually wanted to do an acoustic version of it, for you guys. It talks about a relationship being so wonderful, It's almost to good to be true. You don't know if it is a sweet dream or a beautiful nightmare. Every night I rush to my bed With hopes that maybe I'll get a chance to see you when I close my eyes I'm going outta my head Lost in a fairytale Can you hold my hands and be my guide? Clouds filled with stars cover the skies And I hope it rains You're the perfect lullaby You can be a sweet dream (or a beautiful nightmare) Either way I don't wanna wake up from you or a beautiful nightmare Somebody pinch me Your love's too good to be true My guilty pleasure, I ain't going nowhere Baby, long as you're here I'll be floating on air Cause you're my... or a beautiful nightmare Either way I don't wanna wake up from you Wake up from you...

I'm here to empower all the women. This next song is called, "If I Were A Boy." If I were a boy Even just for one day I'd roll outta bed in the morning And throw on what I wanted and go Drink beer with the guys And chase after girls I'd kick it with who I wanted And I'd never get confronted for it 'Cause they'd stick up for me Sing! If I were a boy I think I could understand How it feels to love a girl I swear I'd be a better man I'd listen to her 'Cause I know how it hurts When you lose the one you wanted 'Cause he's taken you for granted And everything you had got destroyed If I were a boy I would turn off my phone Tell everyone it's broken So they'd think that I was sleepin' alone Yeah, right! I'd put myself first And make the rules as I go 'Cause I know that she'd be faithful Waitin' for me to come home (to come home) To come home, to come home It's a little too late for you to come back Say it's just a mistake Think I'd forgive you like that If you thought I would wait for you You thought wrong [Alanis Morisette - You Oughta Know playing] I want you to know That I am happy for you And I want nothing but The best for you both Another version of me, Mr. Duplicity I hate to bug you in the middle of dinner It was a slap in the face How quickly I was replaced Baby are you thinking of me when you... What? Sing! 'Cause the love that you gave that we made Wasn't able to make it enough for you to be open wide No! And every time you speak her name Does she know how you told me you'd hold me until you died 'Til you died, but you're still alive And I'm here, to remind you Of the mess you left when you went away It's not fair, to deny me Of the cross I bear that you gave to me You, you, you oughta know You're just a boy Baby you don't understand Until you lose the one you wanted 'Cause you've taken her for granted And everything you had got destroyed But you're just... A boy This next song is called, "Scared Of Lonely." I'm in this fight and I'm swinging and my arms are getting tired I'm trying to beat this emptiness But I'm running out of time I'm sinking in the sand, and I can barely stand I'm lost in this dream, I need you to hold me I'm scared of lonely I try to be patient, but I'm hurting deep inside And I can't keep waiting I need comfort late at night And I can't find my way, won't you lead me home 'Cause I'm lost in this dream, I need you to hold me I'm scared of lonely And I'm scared of being the only shadow I see along the wall And I'm scared the only heartbeat I hear beating is my own And I'm scared of being alone I can't seem to breathe cause I am lost in this dream, I need you to hold me I'm scared of lonely I'm scared of lonely I'm scared of lonely, lonely, lonely Lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely Lonely I need your strength when nobody is around 'Cause I'm tired of this emptiness, I think I'm drowning I can't be lonely no more Cause I'm lost in this dream, I need you to hold me I'm scared of lonely And I'm scared of being the only shadow I see along the wall And I'm scared the only heartbeat I hear beating is my own And I'm scared of being alone I can't seem to breathe cause I am lost in this dream, I need you to hold me I'm scared of lonely Diamonds used to be coal Look young 'cause they got soul That's why they're beautiful And my heart used to be cold 'Til your hands laid on my soul, baby And that's why you're beautiful I'm not wondering why The sky's blue. That's not my business I look up and tell myself, "Be patient, love That could be us." Lovers used to make love And die just to give us Their piece of the beautiful Remember when we made love? Love Wasn't it beautiful? Don't ask me why The sky's blue. That's not my business Look up and tell myself, "Be patient, love That could be us." Diamonds used to be coal Look young 'cause they got soul And my heart used to be cold 'Til your hands laid on my soul Somebody's got to stay deep in love That could be us That's why we're beautiful That's why we're beautiful That's why we're beautiful Satellites Flashing by It's a beautiful state we're in But how can we love in isolation? Think how happy we can be when we just try We're nothing like we seem Passionate words are never spoken You don't know how I bleed when I leave your side In your eyes Love's alive We've come untied 'Cause we're flashing by Like satellites Satellites If we don't communicate, We'll exist in our own space We have all the love we need While we're apart, I cannot breathe Satellites Flashing by Satellites I'd like to take a moment to... thank to strings. I want you all to give it up for the beautiful ladies. Thank you ladies. Alright. How many of you have ever been lied to? I'm sure everyone has. We all have. Well this next song... ...is from my last album. B'Day. I've never performed this song before. I'm doing this especially for encore. You don't mind if I sit right here, huh? Well it talks about a relationship... After you've been lied to... and you're trying your best to forgive. It's really difficult, cause you never forgive. It's called, "Resentment." I wish I could believe you Then I'll be alright But now everything you told me Really don't apply To the way I feel inside Loving you was easy Once upon a time But now my suspicions of you have multiplied And it's all because you lied I only give you a hard time 'Cause I can't go on and pretend like I haven't tried to forgive this But I'm much too full of resentment Just can't seem to get over The way you hurt me Don't know how you gave another Who didn't mean a thing, no The very thing you gave to me I thought I could forgive you And I know you've changed As much as I wanna trust you I know it ain't the same And it's all because you lied I only give you a hard time 'Cause I can't go on and pretend like I haven't tried to forgive this But I'm much too full of resentment I may never understand why I'm doing the best that I can and I I tried and I tried to forgive this But I'm much too full of resentment I always remember feelin' Like I was no good Like I couldn't do it for you Like that wack bitch could And it's all because you lied Loved you more than ever More than my own life The best part of me I gave you It was sacrificed And it's all because you lied You lied, you lied You lied I know she was attractive But I was here first Been riding with you for 6 years Why did I deserve To be treated this way by you I know you're probably thinking What's up with B? But I'm crying Can't stop crying Can't stop crying You could've told me you weren't happy I know you didn't wanna hurt me But look at what you've done to me now I gotta look at her in her eyes And see she's had half of me She ain't even half of me Look what you've done to me now And it's all 'cause you lied Thank you so much. Thank you. Oh, that was so sweet, thank you. Now it's time for us to have some fun. But you have to get up on your feet. Now, I have so many influences... Miss Aretha Franklin, Josephine Baker and Ella Fitzgerald. I wanna give you a little bit of Ella. We're in Vegas, right? Alright. Well... I think I need y'all to put your hands together. Are you all ready to have a good time? Y'all ready to make it swing? Alright, repeat after me. Say, "Hey!" I think y'all could be a little louder, gimme a little... Say, "Hey!" What about this side over here? Say, "Hey, hey!" Alright now, ladies! I love that just for you all. Baby Seems like everywhere I go I see you From your eyes, your smile It's like I breathe you Helplessly I reminisce Don't want to compare nobody to you Boy, I try to catch myself But I'm out of control Your sexiness is so appealing I can't let it go, baby Know that I can't get over you 'Cause everything I see is you And I don't want no substitute Baby I swear it's Deja Vu Know that I can't get over you 'Cause everything I see is you And I don't want no substitute Baby I swear it's Deja Vu Baby I can't go anywhere Without thinking that you're there Seems like you're everywhere, it's true Gotta be having Deja Vu 'Cause in my mind I want you here Get on the next plane, I don't care I'm missing you That I'm having Deja Vu Boy, I try to catch myself But I'm out of control Your sexiness is so appealing I can't let it go Know that I can't get over you 'Cause everything I see is you And I don't want no substitute Baby I swear it's Deja Vu Know that I can't get over you 'Cause everything I see is you And I don't want no substitute Baby I swear it's Deja Vu Know that I can't get over you 'Cause everything I see is you And I don't want no substitute Baby I swear it's Deja Vu Know that I can't get over you 'Cause everything I see is you And I don't want no substitute Baby I swear it's Deja Vu Ladies, get 'em! [Tap Sequence] How you all feeling, Las Vegas? I wanna do something a little different. Tonight I wanna share my story with all of you. Is that OK? Audience: Yeah! Well by the age of five, I knew exactly what I wanted to be. And that was a singer. I grew up watching tapes of Motown, The Supremes, The Jackson 5. Michael Jackson was a huge inspiration. Ever since I was a little kid. Some of you may not know this but I started out in a singing group. And it was Destiny's Child. We got together when we were 9 years old. And "Where You Are" one of the Jackson 5 songs, was the first song we learned. It was 1990 in Houston, Texas. And we were rocking out Cross Colors and we were practicing our harmonies and choreography. And this was our big moment, because Columbia Records was in the house. Can it be I stayed away too long Did I leave your mind when I was gone It's not my thing trying to get back But this time let me tell you where I'm at I wanna be where you are, oh Anywhere you are, oh I wanna be where you are, oh Anywhere you are, whoa oh Stop! Beyonce... Did you go swimming last night? Cause I sure do hear a lot of snot in your nose. My father... was our manager. Stop the audition. I was so mortified. He told the big record executives: "I'm sorry you guys wasted your time. You flew all the way out here but these girls are not focused. They are not... ready." You know what? He was kinda right. We were only 9 years old and we were not ready. We kept practicing... until we made it on the television show... Star Search! But we lost. But we kept practicing until we got signed to Electra Records. Lights, action, Hollywood But we got dropped. But in 1995... We got signed to Columbia Records. Hallelujah! And in 1997... We were ready. And we came out with our first single, "No, No, No." You be sayin', "No, no, no, no, no" When it's really, "Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes" You be sayin', "No, no, no, no, no" When it's really, "Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes" This is the remix The jeeps pump this new remix (Uh-huh) This is the remix Radios play this remix I want you all to stand up and say "No, No, No" with us tonight. C'mon! No, no Can't be sayin' yeah-eh No Yeah! No! Yeah! Boy, I know you want me, I can see it in your eyes But you keep on frontin', won't you say what's on your mind? ?Cause each and every time you need me, you give me signs But when I ask you, "What's the deal?", you hold it all inside If you wanna be with me, you gotta keep it real Tell me what's going on, tell me how you feel Boy, I know you want me just as much as I want you So come and get my love, it's all here for you Every time I see you with your boys You pretend as if you don't want me When you get home, you call me on the phone And tell me how much you care Bug-a-boo You bugging what? you bugging who? You bugging me! Sing! You make me wanna throw my pager out the window Tell MCI to cut the phone poles Break my lease so I can move Cause you a bug a boo, a bug a boo I wanna put your number on the call block Have AOL make my emails stop "No, No, No" and "Bug A Boo" became number one records. And the hits just kept on coming. But it wasn't enough to keep the group together. Can you pay my bills? Can you pay my telephone bills? Do you pay my automo' bills? If you did then maybe we could chill I don't think you do (So what?) So, you and me are through Can you pay my bills? Can you pay my telephone bills? Do you pay my automo' bills? If you did then maybe we could chill I don't think you do So, you and me are through And then there were two... And then there were four. Say my name, say my name If no one is around you, say ?baby I love you? If you ain't runnin' game Say my name, say my name You actin' kinda shady, ain't callin' me baby Why the sudden change? Say my name, say my name If no one is around you, say ?baby I love you? If you ain't runnin' game Say my name, say my name You actin' kinda shady, ain't callin' me baby Better say my name Any other day, I would call, you would say (Say) "Baby, how's your day?" But today, it ain't the same Every other word is "uh-huh, yeah ok" (Uh huh, ok) Could it be that you are at the crib with another lady? If you took it there, first of all, let me say (Let me say) I am not the one to sit around, and be played Baby why? Why you got to lie? I'm all up in your game, you better say my name What? I know you say that I am assuming things Something's going down that's the way it seems Shouldn't be no reason why you're acting strange If nobody's holding you back from me 'Cause I know how you usually do When you say everything to me times two Why can't you just tell the truth? If somebody's there then tell me who Sing! Boy, say my name Let me hear you sing! -Say my name, say my name -Say my name Say my name, say my name If no one is around you, say ?baby I love you? (yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah) Yeah yeah yeah All my Destiny's Child fans... Remember this. Ladies leave your man at home Ladies leave your man at home Ladies leave your man at home -Cause it's eleven thirty and the club is jumpin', jumpin' -C'mon and let me see you bounce! Bounce! Bounce! Bounce! Bounce! Keep bouncing yeah! Dip that thing! They called us male bashers. They called us gold diggers. And I had enough. So I wrote my own theme song. -Independent Woman. -Yeah! I went into the studio... all by myself. And I recorded a demo. Because I wanted to make it very very clear... ...that we paid our own bills. Here comes my father again. He snucked the demo. And he took it to Sony Pictures... ...to summit for the soundtrack for Charlie's Angels. Now, why did he do that? Question! Well the song ended up being number one for 12 weeks in a row. So I guess, he ended up doing the right thing. Question! Lucy Liu With my girl, Drew Cameron D. and Destiny And then there were three. Question, tell me what you think about me I buy my own diamonds and I buy my own rings Only ring your celly when I'm feelin lonely When it's all over, please get up and leave Question, tell me how you feel about this Try to control me, boy, you get dismissed Pay my own fun, oh, and I pay my own bills Always 50-50 in relationships The shoes on my feet, I bought it The clothes I'm wearing, I bought it The rock I'm rocking, I bought it 'Cause I depend on me if I want it The watch I'm wearing, I bought it The house I live in, I bought it The car I'm driving, I've bought it I depend on me (I depend on me) All the women, who are independent Throw your hands up at me (Throw your hands up) All the honeys, who making money (c'mon!) Throw your hands up at me (I don't see your hands up!) All the mommas, who profit dollars Throw your hands up at me (Throw your hands up!) All the ladies, who truly feel me (c'mon!) Throw your hands up at me It's 2000. And we were on a long flight to Japan. And I came across this Stevie Nicks sample. Something about this guitar riff reminded me of a voluptous woman. I might have been fooled off at that benadryl. Hell, I might have been fool from all the food I've been eatin'. But I said, I'm gonna write a song to celebrate a woman's curves. And no matter what they said about me... I was bootylicious. You don't believe me? Look it up in a dictionary. Kelly, can you handle this? Michelle, can you handle this? Beyonce, can you handle this? I don't think they can handle this I don't think you're ready for this jelly I don't think you're ready for this jelly I don't think you're ready for this Cause my body's too bootylicious for ya babe I don't think you're ready for this jelly I don't think you're ready for this jelly I don't think you're ready for this Cause my body's too bootylicious for ya babe Baby can you handle this? Baby can you handle this? Baby can you handle this? I don't think you can handle this With a lot of success, comes a lot of negativity. And this next song was a defining moment in our careers. Everyone was saying that Destiny's Child... ...was like the reality television show, "Survivor." Try to figure out which member would end up being the last one on the island. They were trying to be nasty. But it actually inspired me to go back into the studio... pick up my paper and my pen... and write us out of all of that negativity. The result... If you survived sexism, racism and illness, if you survived just a hater, put your fist up and sing with me tonight. Now that you're out of my life, I'm so much better You thought that I'd be weak without you, but I'm stronger You thought that I'd be broke without you, but I'm richer You thought that I'd be sad without you, I laugh harder You thought I wouldn't grow without you, now I'm wiser Thought that I'd be helpless without you, but I'm smarter You thought that I'd be stressed without you, but I'm chillin' You thought I wouldn't sell without you, we sold millions, what? I'm a survivor (What?) I'm not gon' give up (What?) I'm not gon' stop (What?) I'm gon' work harder (What?) I'm a survivor (What?) I'm gonna make it (What?) I will survive (What?) Keep on survivin' (What?) I'm a survivor (What?) I'm not gon' give up (What?) I'm not gon' stop (What?) I'm gon' work harder (What?) Where all my survivors in the house tonight? I'm a survivor (What?) I'm not gon' give up (What?) I'm not gon' stop (What?) I'm gon' work harder (What?) I will survive, I will survive, you will survive All my survivors... I want you to pump your fist. Up top. All my survivors... Sing! "I'm a survivor," here we go! I'm a survivor, I'm a survivor Faster! I was 19 years old. And I was asked to be in one of the biggest movies of the year. Austin Powers. My mother actually told me that Mike Myers and the producers wanted to have a meeting with me. I had never been in a film before so... I was completely nervous. But she told me: "Baby you're not gonna get the movie acting like that." So I watched my black exploitation films... and I walked into that audition and said, "Director! I'm Foxxy Cleopatra and I'm a whole lot of woman sugar! How you doing honey baby? You know I don't ask for much, but For a girl spending time alone can be pretty rough But I get a knock on my door You know it's yours for sure We can't wait for the bedroom So we just hit the floor, sing it Is y'all alright? I don't know but I know what's happening to me, girl Is y'all alright? Is y'all alright? I don't know but I know what's happening to me, girl See you gotta work it out Baby gotta work it out See you gotta work it out I like this. Baby, we take it to the bridge now. So baby hold me like you don't wanna let go I'm feeling foxy cause boy you taking it slow Daddy you've given me a taste of your honey I want the whole beehive I'm gonna call you my sugar Cause I had the sweetest time See you gotta work it out See you gotta work it out Baby gotta work it out, work it out Work it out, work it out Work it out, work it out Work it out, work it out Y'all feeling good? I'm feeling good. Now it's 2002. I had a number one movie... Seven consecutive number one songs. This time I had 3 Grammys. All of this success... Now focused all of my childhood and my teenage years, all my career. So I felt a little bit lonely. And finally one day, I found love. We did our very first song together... Called "Bonnie and Clyde." But I need my ladies to help me sing it. All I need in this life of sin is me and my boyfriend Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend All I need in this life of sin is me and my boyfriend Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend Now it's your turn, c'mon! All I need in this life of sin is me and my boyfriend Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend All right ladies, one more time. -All I need in this life of sin is me and my boyfriend -Yeah! Down to ride 'til the very end, is me and my boyfriend Now it's 2003. My first solo album. There would definitely not be a Beyonce without Destiny's Child. I love my girls. You would think after all of this success we had... I would've proven myself, right? Wrong. There were more challenges. I put my heart and my soul into writing my first album, "Dangerously In Love." And after playing the songs for my record label, they told me... I didn't have one hit on my album. What? Dangerously In Love, Me, Myself and I, Baby Boy, Naughty Girl. And my favourite song, Crazy In Love. And they told me I didn't have one hit on my album. I guess they were kinda right. I had five. Now I'mma do this one time and one time only. Y'all listening right? Now, I know you like it when I... shake my ass. But sometimes I'd like to smooth it all out. Ladies! Have you ever been in love? Yes! I don't think you all heard me. I asked, "Have you ever been in love?" I mean that, good, good love. The love that have you going crazy! The love that have you going crazy! You think you're crazy? I'll show you crazy. Know crazy so well... I know "crazy" so damn well. I wrote a song about it. Like to hear? Here you go.
