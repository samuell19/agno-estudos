It could be. Yes... to recover from the hangover. Why were you so lost? Ah, poor baby Love Oh god... It's a happy feeling It's whenever you want to be around someone all the time I think love is really just giving everything else to another person and doing so unconditionally There's so many different kinds of love and so many different ways to love and so many different ways that people show love, and people interpret love that I think it's just one of those things that no one will ever really be able to explain what it is. Who am I? Evita is a mother, a wife She's a big dork, nerdy strange, ecclectic unique Evita is bisexual I think those are big parts of who she is She is Evita I am 33 years old and I have been married to my husband Kevin for 12 years I'm sitting next to you Aww! Pretend I like you I remember the first day I saw her. I walked into a church and I looked across the room and I heard her laugh, saw her smile and her laugh, and immedietely I was into her It was a very conservative church, I would even say borderline cult-ish We couldn't have TVs, we couldn't go to the movies the men couldn't have beards. And one of the things that was wrong was being homosexual, you know, being gay or being bisexual, or being a lesbian or anything like that So when you'd get up and give testimonies about what things the Lord has delivered you from that was one of the things that he was to have supposedly have delivered me from which is having same-sex tendancies but that was never really the case. I am Brianna Garduno, I'm 26 years old and I'm in San Diego California I dated boys up until high school my very first sexual experience was not a very good one so I sworn off men and I decided if this is what sex with men is like I don't want any part of it It was a guy I'd known for a while, so I kind of trusted him and so I was like ok, we'll do it and so he started and it hurt so I started crying and was like I want to stop and he said no, no, no. And he didn't stop until I was like I think I'm a lesbian. And he was like what? So I don't trust men that easily. Well one of the things I love about you, is your beauty, your intellect We just kind of started talking, and we would serve together in church and that's how we started interacting with eachother we fell pretty hard for eachother She's the spice to my life. My life would be so very boring without Evita. She's my spice. As much as I love my relationship with Kevin, one of the issues that we had was we had difficulty in our sexual life. He'd never been a very sexual person, at all. I would beg him sometimes, please, please please I wanna do something and he'd be just like "no, no, no" And now - I'd go pray I would literally go into the closet, and just stay in the closet for hours and pray and read his bible, study the bible. And kind of leave me out there, hanging. Being so closed up in regard to sexuality, I just wasn't open. I came out to my family and everyone as a lesbian when I was Sophomore in highschool and I just dated women until then. I met my ex fiance of five years in 2009 he and I ended things in May I've always wanted to be a mom, I wanted to have kids the whole nine yards, so whenever I got with JL that's what I wanted, I wanted to have kids, he wanted to have kids. I have three children, they are twin boys that are 9 and a five year old daughter. Hi my name is Vivian, so the tall one is named Dimitrius and the medium sized one is Darius Do you want to start In 2012, in September, Darius got diagnosed with medulloblastoma Which is a brain cancer We got sent in the abulance to Los Angeles, we spent two months in the hospital because he had to get brain surgery, and he had to go through six weeks of radiation and then about a year and a half of chemotherapy. The surgery left him a vegetable really, for weeks he had to re-learn how to talk, how to eat He couldn't even swallow his own spit. You kinda say to yourself, they're gonna get older and they're gonna grow up and move on and go and live their own lives, and now we're looking at... that may not be possible for him Sometimes I wonder if he's gonna get to a place where he starts to feel sorry for himself Or want to know why Or be angry, that this happened to him. And I don't really have a lot of answers, I don't know how to help him with that And when something like this happens, it's like you try to fit this massive situation into your box of religion and it doesn't fit. In that sense, I felt let down, I suppose. And that what made me separate myself from religion because I felt like when it came down to the tough times in life, it didn't help me out I just can't believe it, this is our church It's just funny because we're such different people now That environment overall is not a place where I felt like we could stay It was a lot, lot, lot to deal with I think we got into the swinging thing, just to kindof get away, and escape was in a bisexual women's group and so it suggested some other groups that were similar, so I joined one of the groups and they had a party, a swinger party, and so we decided to go Swinging is always something that I was like oh... that sounds really sexy but I don't know if I would ever do it so once I became single I was like well, if I'm gonna try it, I might as well try it while I'm single I got invited to that swinger party and that's basically what it came down to, like "I'm scared but I'm gonna do it anyway" It was, honestly kind of surreal, because, the environment we came from and it was at a party and they're were probably like 10 other people in the room. Oh it was wild. I was actually thinking about leaving, but then Evita walks in, I heard her before I saw her and then Kevin came up and he approached me that night and he was like "hey, what's going on, do you wanna do something?" and that was the night I was like, I think I just wanna play with women. He did try to talk to me first but I was like eh. So he was like ok, ok. And then later on in the evening is whenever Evita talked to me. I never felt like I would ever find a female that I like that liked me. It was almost unbelievable for me, that here it is this girl that I'm so into and she likes me back. That's how that world opened up to us and then through the world of Swinging we discovered the world of Polyamory I knew I liked women, I'd had sex with women but I never had a girlfriend So I wanted that experience. So we actually got into Poly to date seperately he was going to seek to find a partner for himself, and I was gonna seek to find a partner for myself but then we met Bri and she was just someone that we both were into and that's where our Poly stort went She'd mentioned that she wanted a girlfriend and I didn't know if she meant me I was thrown by the idea, because she's married. But we all just went really well together At first I did not want to, I told my wife that that could be a relationship for her to explore that side of herself and I wanted to stay out of it, but they both invited me in, so I willingly decided to get involved in joining the relationship. It started off just swinging, we were all just having a good time together, it all started from a sexual relationship. We had threesomes, I would come over to their house occassionally, I started spending the night there and like I said the kids were at their grandmother's house for an entire month, so it was just an entire month of fun and everything So we were just running around, cavorting around San Diego, just acting like everything was great and once the kids came back it was like, woah, this is real, this is a family. Just from there, spending so much time together like that in an intimate setting, feelings just developed from that it was just always the trajectory of the relationship, I don't think it was any one person's idea Really we got together and we just starting running. - Yeah we punched it. We got together and it was just went from 0 to 100, really quickly My name's Kevin -I'm Evita -And I'm Brianna And we're Polyamorous! It's complicated in a sense, but the children already had two stable parents. So it was pretty much us figuring out how to integrate Brianna into what we already had established. This is Bri, she's like family, she doesn't always stay but she'll come over and act like a mom. This is me winning a pumpkin. This is Dad, this is Bri, this is me We told the kids-one day we sat them down with Bri. It was funny because I had to come out to the kids as bisexual, they didn't know what that was. And I explained that to them, and then after that we told them who she was and we just said she's our partner, the way mommy and daddy are romantically involved with eachother, we're romantically involved with her. And you're to respect her and treat her like you would any adult, care for her and love her. And they were just like "O.K" and that was the end of it. Sometimes she'll pick us up from school Sometimes she'll take care of us when mommy and daddy are gone It's like living in a house with your family you're all there, you all pitch in whenever you need to Somebody does the dishes, somebody does the cooking, somebody helps the kids with their homework It's just like living with a big family. The smart and intelligent the same thing? I love you I love you babe - I love you I'll see you ladies soon What made Bri special was the fact that both of us enjoy her We're so opposite on so many things but there was this one person that we could both get into and that was exciting for us I'd never had a girlfriend before that, she was like a dream come true for me Alright baby, I'm over here - I love you We talked about having a commitment ceremony, and usually that's the equivalent of a wedding. Planning a life, having children together, and things like that. A lot of people think that because you're in Polyamorous relationships that jealousy doesn't happen, or it shouldn't happen and that is just not the case. It comes up so often sometimes you just learn to cope with it better. I've done some pretty immature shit in this relationship, like I've done a lot of things that I'm not particularly proud of Kevin and Bri used to use condoms together and I've shredded them up sometimes because I was upset about something and I'd go in his drawer and get them out and I'd just rip em apart If you're poly but you're dating seperately a lot of what would be happening with the person's other partner is happening apart from you. But with a triad it's like right in your face. This is the first time I've made him a salad and it almost sometimes feels like a double betrayal because both of your partners are with someone else and that someone else is eachother. Can you scoop it in a bowl babe? - sure Thank you, thank you - Are you talking to this babe or that babe? Any babe, ok, the first babe that responds Oh did you hear that? What? - She said you talking to me because you don't call her babe. Oh, what do I call you then? One of the problems was just navigating through a couple who are already married and dealing with feelings that they had about that and dealing with my own feelings There were a lot of things that she wanted out of life that we really couldn't give her She wanted to have a baby, and it wasn't that we weren't willing to give them to her we just couldn't right now. I think the last year and a half of us journeying through Polyamory has been the most difficult time of our marriage Anyway, real quick you guys, just to let you guys know. Bri's not gonna be here for a little while for maybe just a couple of weeks. Where's she going? She's spending some time with her grandma. So, what happened yesterday it started out with something that was small and it really just blew out of proportion. Evita and I got into a bit of a disagreement and things just went way further than they had before. So we decided it was just time to end things She was asleep and I was here in the house and I was watching TV and putting a puzzle together and waiting for her to wake up so we could start our day And then she downstairs and she was visibly upset I was like "Good morning honey" and she was just like "Hey." So I was like ok well, something is wrong. I really like to deal with things internally and that's just not always a good thing. So it's something I still need to work on But she never really did she would say she was dealing with her feeling internally but it would always manifest itself in her behaviour so that's not really you dealing with your feelings internally that's you acting out So I kept asking her what was wrong and she said "nothing nothing nothing" "I'm fine I'm fine I'm fine" And at that moment, I just got really pissed off She was packing her things to leave and I was like if you're gonna go, if you walk out that door, we're done. That's it, leave, go. And she was like fine, I know that. So she packed her stuff and she walked out. So I was like ok, well, now we're done. We were just in very different places in life. In very different places of maturity, in different places of financially in just every area you could think of we were just in different places. And that's about it, that's all you guys need to know for right now. It's gonna be like we never met Bri! - I wouldn't say that. - Yeah me neither! It's gonna be like we didn't even know Bri when Mom told us of that No, it won't be that. I don't think that this happened because of Polyamory I just think it's who we are as individuals. Maybe she and I just weren't meant to be together. I love what we had, I loved the little family that we were creating When I was in it, I felt like it was worth the work that it took to keep it together It sucks, you know. Because in this I was building relationships with the kids and I love them so much, and so now even Kevin came to bring me my things last night and I'm like it sucks because I don't even get to see the kids anymore It sucks. I don't wanna say that I love them as their mother because I don't know what that feels like as a true parent but I love them as much as I could love somebody else. It hurts so much because you spent the time and the effort and now where is it? I told Kevin that if I put myself in his shoes if I had a partner that I loved or person that I loved that loved me that I wouldn't want to say goodbyr to that until I was ready to And... for that reason alone, I said I think you should continue on with her. Do you already know what you're going to have? - Yeah, I'm gonna get the white chicken chillie We got into Poly together, we dated this person together and now it feels like we're moving apart it feels like a seperation, like he's going on without me And charting his course and he knows where it's going and he's moving on without me and I feel like I'm steering off into this Poly wilderness and I don't know what it holds and I'm all alone. Tonight is Halloween and we're going trick-or-treating with the kids. And we're gonna get ourselves some candy Trick or Treat! - Hi, happy Halloween, there you go. There's a Cookie Monster with cookies inside I'm dealing with the sadness of him having another partner and me not having another partner, me not knowing if I'll ever find someone... find what he has with Bri with someone and having to date again and meet people and deal with all that bullshit - Hey! - How's it going? Mommy, look how much candy I have. Wow that's incredible We're trying to work on our friendship and I feel like as time goes further it'll just be easier And... we are back together Bri and I kepy in contact throughout the breakup She asked me to go to dinner and... I was like OK, we can go to dinner. Then I asked her if it was gonna be a date and was like "I'd like it to be" so I was like alright, we can do that Oh so gently! -It's corny but she liked it, you like being corny Oh I love you! You know it's just another relatioship option and that's really all it is For me it's really about the freedom to be who I am That's what Polyamory is about for me. Polyamory is not for everyone, it's really not I wouldn't recommend just jumping in, not knowing because then you won't be as prepared for some problems that arise I think there is a hightened level of communication in Polyamory You don't really learn how to communicate and in Poly you have to It has to be something that everyone is willing and is willing to participate in. Where have you been? Don't you know we are having guests tonight? The bus was late! The village headman is here. Hurry up! Diella, bring me the tray. Faster. If your sister is unmarried, you are obliged to find a husband for her. There is a further obligation that you must fulfill If she dies without having children, you are obliged to organize her funeral. A sister has no right to inherit any wealth. It is crucial to know that when brothers want to divide the ancestral property, they must distribute it among themselves, whereas she, has no right to ingeritance. She shouldget marries and have children. Once again, let me remind you that brother are obliged to assist their sister to find a husband and get married. I am very pleased to hear that you are legally seeking your equal share of your ancestral property. This is in accordance with the constitution, thus your request is legitimate. However, there is a problem, a significant one. Usually these cases last for a very long time in the court, as a result they remain undecided, since this is not the court's priority Take my advice, try to come to an arrangement with your family members. I insist this is the best and most efficiant way. Have a good day. Put some lipstick on. Take it! What would you like to drink? A cup of tea. Would you like the same? Make that two. Hava, I believe Qazim already told you about me. I am a mechanic. I fix cars. My garage is nearby. Our fathers used to know eachother well. Did you have a conversation with Muhamed? He is a good and hardworking guy Unfortunately, luck wasn't on his side, his wife passed away recently. Listen sister, he asked about you, he is interested in you. I gave him my aproval because I know him personally. I knew his father as well. Now that you are getting older, I would like you to settle down What's the matter? Why are you so silent, are you even listening to me? It's for your own good Next week, they will ask you for your hand in marriage. Be very careful with you decision. No, I don't want to. I am not interested in that man. I don't want to get married. Nobody can decide my future, not even you. I never want to hear this conversation again! Add flour and slim it carefully. Use you palm to add pressure. You have to learn before it's too late. You can't leave these things after you get married. That's more like it, well done. Hava? Qazim wants to speak with you. Is she learning? Of course, she is doing better than me. How are you Hava? Alright, how about you? I'm good. Great. Are you going to work tomorrow? Yes. At what time? Evening shift. Very well. Get you clothes ready, tomorrow at ten we are going to our aunt's place You will stay there for a couple of days, until I find you a place to rent. Qaze, I don't know what to say. It is difficult to find an apartment. Considering her income, expenses are quite high. She will have to pay for rent, electricity, water and waste I'm not sure she can cope with it. I'll pay for the first six months, no problem. Yes but Qaze, what about afterwards? We will find a solution. She can stay at my place for a few days. But, as you can see I don't have enough space Only a room to do everything, eat, drink and sleep. It's hard enough for me as it is. It's suffocating! However, I will do my best to find her an apartment How is the boy? He is doing better Yesterday he had a fever, but he is feeling better now. What's going on? He came back last night. We didn't know anything about it, he just showed up. They didn't give him the permanant residency permit. I know that from now on it will be difficult for us, but we cannot see each other anymore. Now that he is here, it's dangerous for us to see each other. My blood pressure is high and it's killing me. I am on medication, but it doesn't seem to have an effect. Don't worry, the weather is changing constantly it's probably something to do with that. I hope so. How are you doing my dear, how was work? Not bad aunty, how are you? This is my niece Hava, she is a really good girl, you won't have any problems with her. Thank you for renting your apartment cheaper. May God reward you in return! Do no worry about it ma'am I am not using my apartment at the moment. People say, who does good finds good! Thank you! I would have her stay here but I have no space. I have health conditions I need to have my space, she needs to have hers. Her brothers divided the ancestral property, whereas she is not in a very pleasant position. Please, get in. This is the apartment you are going to live. You will find anything you need here. In case you don't have enough money to pay rent, just call me. I understand your situation Go upstairs! What happened? I'm back. Where? In my home! I have just as much right as you do to live here was born in this house; I have nowhere else to go. Hava, I have taken care of you as you were my own child I got you a job I wanted to find you a husband, but you refused everyone that I proposed. Isn't that right? What do you want now? This is not your home! I will not leave! Don't you understand what I'm saying? Your brother's property is not your business. I don't want to see you face around here again! If you have any complaints, go to the courts, they will find you a solution. Get lost now! What's in the bag? Where are you heading? I have been kicked out. My brother divided the property among themselves They have no place for me. They don't need me anymore! What will you do now? I want to run away. Where? As far as I can. Please come with me. I can't. I can't leave my children! I know. Um... Actually, we need to talk to you about that Oh well you don't have to pay me for lunch No, it's not that We're thinking about cutting back on their painting lessons I'm sorry, it's just...
