Summer 1985, Elkridge, Illinois. An evil force emerged and began hunting down the senior class in alphabetical order, and also claiming the lives of anyone related. The pattern was discovered by social outcast, Zeke Zanderfeldt, the last name listed in the senior yearbook, and thus the last of those whose lives would be taken. Along with a mysterious Jane Doe with telekinetic powers, the duo vowed to stop the evil in its tracks by facing the fear head-on. Zeke enlisted the help of a detective, but his life was taken too. At the last second, as the evil worked its way down the list of names, Zeke and the mysterious girl managed to subdue and seemingly destroy this evil force. Or did they? Authorities questioned Zeke, who they believed was responsible for the deaths. Zeke went into hiding, and the mysterious girl vanished without a trace. The story picks up two years later. Same town, new trouble. - I don't know what you see in this place, Charlotte. It's really dreary. Can't we do something normal, like see a movie? - Shut up, Roland. You have to connect with the dead to really appreciate the living. - Okay well, what are you hoping to do? - You'll see. - No, not that. - Don't be such a pussy. Besides, today's the two year anniversary of this mysterious death. - I don't want to do this. - Don't be such a chicken. Come on, let's do this. Give me your hand. - Fine, we're doing something of my choice after this. - It's happening, it's happening. It's coming, it's coming. It's here, it's open. - Charlotte, I don't think we should be doing this. - Enter the material world. - You fucking pathetic little people. - Zeke. - What the fuck? - I'll bet you want to know what this is all about. - Zeke? Did you make this? - Yes, but we should probably get outta here. Evil is afoot. - It's been two years, my friend. What happened? I haven't heard from you. Ever since all this shit went down, you sorta just disappeared off the map. - I knew I had to hide. The authorities were after me, and they think I had something to do with this. I became obsessed with this evil over the years. I thought I stopped it the first time around. But with these two new deaths of our former classmates, I think we're thinking the same thing right now. - Man this is heavy. I was afraid this was gonna happen again. - Well, I think our gut feelings are trying to tell us something. By the way, you look different. What's what's with the get up? - Ever since this all happened, I'm tougher now. - What do you mean? - Well, my brother was a college student, just about to graduate. He was a member of the track team, all-star, really outstanding. When I heard the news, I didn't know how to react. I mean, how do you go about something like that? All they found of him in the woods, was his grizzled remains. How do you live your life after finding out that news? And the worst part of it all, is that no one would believe me. Nobody believed anything I said. Nobody knew what had really happens. - But obviously we do. - Since then I was lost. I didn't know what to do. Then the Anacondas took me in, just like a family. They're a gang, but I like to think of them as more than that. They're like a brotherhood to me. And they toughened me up. I'm ready now. If I see that demon fucker again. When I felt like this was happening, I knew I had to find you, Zeke. If anybody knows this thing well enough, it's you. Nobody knows it better than you. And together, I say it's finally time we put an end to this thing, once and for all. - Lynda's dead, man, I was just at her house. There's like ambulances outside. When the evil last struck, it went in alphabetical order. That's how I knew how to stop it. Her last name is Prescott. - Meaning? - Meaning the pattern must be different now. Do you have your yearbook? - Yeah, why? - I need to take a look at it, and we need to see if there's something else that we could go off of. Prescott. Prescott, look at this. Art club, drama, and let's see, let me just make sure. Roland, Roland and Charlotte, I didn't really know them, but look at that. Band camp, art club. Could it be? - It's picking off artists. - There's no way to know for sure. Guess we'll just have to wait and see. - Officer Campbell. Lynda Prescott. Two weeks ago, it was Roland Hartley and Charlotte Davenport. That makes three dead this month. I think I know who might've done this. Sarge, what would you do? I'm gonna find the guy who did this. - What the fuck? - So tell me what's going on. - I already told the other officer this, but I had nothing to do with these deaths, okay? I had premonitions, I had these visions. They alerted me to the pattern and me and this girl, I don't know her name, we were able to stop this evil force in time, before it killed anybody else. - Do you realize how ludicrous that sounds? - I don't care how it sounds. This is the way it is. Okay, this girl, she's gone missing now, but we stopped this evil, but I don't think it's gone for good. I think it could come back at any time. I think if you want to do your job correctly, you need to be out there on patrol. - We'll see you next Sunday. Thank you so much for coming. - What's ailing you, Sister? - Father Michaels, I didn't know you were in today. The truth is, I've been feeling an awesome presence, an evil presence rising. These thoughts have been troubling me. I've felt this before, but never so strong, never so strong as this. - Well, evil is always right behind you, closer than you might think, residing over this town, over you, and all of us. - This concerns me deeply. This is why you found me deep in prayer. Why are you wearing your civilian clothes, Father? - That's not important. What's important is you ignore these feelings, and let God handle it. He has a plan, all right. - We need to do something about this. We have to warn the others. I'll gather the Sisters. We'll get everyone together. Father, we need all the help that we can get. This could mean the end. - I wouldn't do that. - Shit, they keep piling up. They're calling them freak accidents. Beyond them all being involved in the arts, I don't see any other connection here. - What do you want to do? If that's all we have to go off of, I don't see how we're gonna find out who's next. - We'll just have to warn the others. You weren't involved in any art programs, were you? - No. - Well I was, this is very personal to me. Wait, we're just gonna have to go down the line of artists. I say we go with Julia Lochley. She was in my senior class. She was in all the school plays in the leads. She'd be a prime target for this evil force. - Zeke, Jake, what do you guys want? - Can you just come with us right now? I'll explain later. - Right now? You better tell me what this is about, Zeke. Let me just grab something and I'll be right out. - This evil, the fear, it's returned. And I, I think it's picking off art students. I know that doesn't make sense. - Say no more. I'll take your word for it. But why return now? Why is it so after our graduating class? Why art students? - I mean, that's what we got to figure out. I seem to be lucky in this situation, or at least I was the last time. I think if you just stick with me, we'll be safe enough until we figure this out. - Can I talk to you for a minute, Zeke? - Yeah, sure. - Why her man? Is this something personal? There are others out there being killed. You just like her. Admit it. - Shut up. No, maybe she's an asset. - Or I delved into the dark arts. Yeah, it's kind of a hobby I picked up, spell casting, curses, healing. - She's an asset, right? So you're either with us or you're not. - All right. - Officer Campbell, the chief wanted me to get this to you. It's a possible missing person of one Thomas Emory, age 20, and he was last seen in the downtown area. - Thank you. Sergeant Mooney? Keep a look out for a Tom Emory. I think we might have another suspect on our hands. - You will soon come to know the truth. - Who are you? Where's this being? What is this place? - Soon your questions will be answered, and you will understand it all. - Jake, this isn't funny. - Hmm. What the? - This thing beckoned me last night. I don't know if it was a dream or if it was real, this place. I don't even know what it is. It's some decrepit old mansion. - The Bellevue Manor. - Wait, I've heard something about that. Bad omens. What's the significance? - I don't know, but I think I know somebody who would know, and we have to go to the high school. So Professor Reinhardt, what do you make of all this? - Richard Charles Bellevue was one of the founders of our town. Legend has it he was into the dark arts and wanted to bring forth a cataclysmic forthcoming of ancient evil. It was he who built this school on a cursed Indian burial ground in 1885. A hundred years later, the curse was set to take place. Your graduating class. The curse was tied to a figurehead, a physical embodiment that was tasked with a specific deed, a ghoul if you will. Of course, the events were set by the ghoul, but obviously it wasn't successful. - The, the seemingly random nature of these new deaths, and why they're happening two years later, what significance does this have? - I would guess the old figurehead was cast out, and a new one was unwillingly chosen to carry on, and the manner of the deaths and the order they occur was set by whoever or whatever is harboring this curse. I'd be willing to bet that this evil, the rift, whence it has came, has something to do with Bellevue Manor. - Well, should we go there? - You can, but I would proceed with extreme caution. You have no idea what you're getting into. That mansion has evil everywhere. - All right, so this Bellevue guy, who built the Manor, he also cursed the school. And based on the fact that I beat this thing the first time around, and especially with these visions, I obviously have some connection with this evil. - And I have a connection with the dark arts. I knew I heard something about Bellevue. I've definitely felt something, it's so clear now, something trying to reach me. When I held a seance last night I picked up on some cryptic messages, but I couldn't make sense of it all. - I can also kind of feel the evil. Just saying, so we all know where we stand. - The professor said something like this evil is emanating from the Manor, like it's some sort of hub for the paranormal. - Then we have to go there. What are we waiting for? - I mean, we need to prepare for this. You have like mystical items, or anything you can bring, spells. - I'll see what I can find. - Just for thirty grand a semester. I don't need art school. Some of our greatest artists never even went to art school. Who's out there? I am not in the mood for games right now, show yourself! Nice costume, really scary. Now, who is it? I'm gonna call the cops. - It's time again, Zeke. The puzzle will be complete. - All right, guys, I'll be out in a second. - Authorities are baffled as these strange deaths continue to pile up. Is this the work of a method killer? Channel 4 investigates. - Don't forget your umbrellas if you're going outside tonight. There's a possible storm. - Hello? - Hey Ken, it's Trixie, what are you doing? - Right now? Nothing. - Wrong, you're coming over to my plate right now. - What's the rush? - You'll find out hen you get here. My roommate's out of town, and we'll have the place all to ourselves. - Okay, I'll be right over. - Laura Whitley? Impaled by sticks? God damn it. And we're still no closer to catching this bastard. I'm not cut out for this job. - What is writing, but a collection of shapes that form words, words which make sounds to summate the complex constructs that which cannot be easily summed up. Writing is but a poor man's painting. What the hell have I been doing? Father, what brings you here? - As you may have known, some of your friends have met their cruel and mysterious demise as of late. This has troubled me. I just thought I'd check in. - Oh, thank you. I'm fine, no mystery or cruelty here. - One can never be too sure, Sean. By the way, what are you doing on this fine day? - Trying to get some writing done, college essay, a writing essay about writing essays, I guess. - Writing an essay about writing essays, you say? - Yes, I say I'm writing an essay. Got to get back to it if you don't mind, Father. - Death will fall upon you. And the wrath of evil itself will envelop this town, in an inescapable cloud of death and destruction no mortal has witnessed before. - Father, what are you doing here? - Oh Sean, I just thought I'd lend you a hand. - Trixie, you promised me. - I promised nothing, Chad. I just said, come over. Your dirty mind came to that conclusion. - Come on, I took you to see the Bangles, and we can't even hook up? - Fine, lay down. I've got to go get something real quick. - All right. - Stay right there. - You got it. - Are you ready? - Absolutely. - No, not my hat! - All right guys, this seems familiar to me. I think we just keep going straight. Yeah, I can feel something. Something doesn't feel right. It should be the next left. I hope we're prepared. - Here we are, the hub of the evil. I can feel its essence like never before, like a pressure on my forehead. Zeke, do you feel anything? - I can hear it. It's beckoning us. - We've got to go inside, it's the only way. Stay close, come on. - Seek this way. - Zeke, where you going? This place is creepy, man. Hey man, it's coming on. What do you feel? - Now I've got you mortals right where I want you. You will endure my wrath as did the others before. - It was you the whole time. - When I defeated the evil the first time around, it latched on to me, feeding off my subconscious, my insecurity, using me as a catalyst, lashing out at those I felt threatened by. I didn't know I harbored this curse until now. I was always jealous of you, Jake. I was jealous of everyone. But that thing out there, that's not me. It's an empty shell harboring evil curse. And if you want to defeat this evil, you must defeat me. - I can't do that, man. - You know what must be done. I have to go now. - Stay away from Jake. I am the artist, I am the one you want. - Him first, he was a jock. - Heretofore, I command you to let this man go. I banish you to the underworld. Zeke, fight it. - Yeah, I'm not a jock, Zeke. I just played tennis for a while. - You're not helping. Zeke, I know you're upset you didn't get cast in that play that you wanted to. But this, this isn't you. The omen is feeding off of your insecurities. Try to separate yourself. Evil spirits, I command thee to the underworld for eternity. Leave this world. We must [indistinct]. Let go of this body you're possessing. I banish thee. I banish thee. Get back to whence you came. You will not claim another. I banish you to the great beyond. Leave this world. Leave it in peace, let go of this body you possess. I banish thee, I banish thee! Holy shit, it worked. Let's get outta here now. - Officer Campbell, there's been a fire at the Bellevue Manor. Possible arsonist. - I'm on it. God. Cheryl, hold all my calls. Has anybody found a lead on this Thomas Emory? Anybody? My God. - I know Julia, but he's gone. I can't just bring him back with your magic. It's over. You're right. He wouldn't have wanted it to be like this. We gotta keep his memory alive, that's the least I can do. I know, don't worry about me, I'll be fine. I gotta go pay my respects now. Yeah. I really appreciate you talking me through all this. Your a good friend, Julia. People like us gotta stick together. Always. Bye. Hey Zeke. It's your old friend, Jake. I really miss you, man. Brought you some stuff. The school yearbook, I got everyone to sign it. Well, actually they insisted on signing it. Everybody missed you, a lot. And I got you a mix tape. I made this just for you. It's got all your favorite hits on it. I know you really liked the Ramones. I got you something here, too. Through the darkness, He will find you. Shed the guilt, the curse that binds you. Now in death, you are free to rest. You gave your life, so there's no evil left. We did it Zeke. It's over. You can finally rest now. - Continuing from our report earlier, we've been getting calls all day, and authorities have issued a state of emergency. Reports of strange happenings, murders, and appearance suicides, flooding in, as ominous clouds form over residential areas. Remain indoors, as we honestly have never seen anything like this before. - That is beautiful. - Not as beautiful as your eyes. - These eyes? - Yes, those eyes. - I told you all. I told you all it was happening and you didn't believe me. I told you . All I've done. There's nothing left for us. I said it was coming. I told you all. I screamed it from the top of my lungs, the top of the head. - Oh my God, he was right the whole time. - Officer Campbell? Officer Campbell, come in Officer Campbell. - Chief, I don't know what the fuck is going on out there, but that's why I'm down here in my basement, okay? I'm in my own goddamn basement, okay? What I thought was one incident turned into a string of incidents, Chief. You gave me one simple case, and now it's just turned into this fucking hell. That's why I'm down in my basement, because I'm gonna wait until hell blows over. And then when it does, I'll come back out and I'll see. I'll see all the damage it's done. Chief, stay faithful, over.
