(HONKING) (SINGING FRÈRE JACQUES IN VIETNAMESE) (CHILDREN CHATTERING IN VIETNAMESE) Hello. Do you want to come in? Come. It's okay. Come on. Come on, come on, come on. This is our new friend. (GREETING IN VIETNAMESE) Madame Ngai want us to speak English. What is his name? He no speak to us yet. Now, you all go back to the game. Come on. Let's go, let's go. Let's go, let's go. Let's go, let's go, let's go. Hey. What in paper? Uh, American sol--soldier men. Come back, save Saigon. Hey! No believe what in paper! Hey, that's my paper! MAN ON RADIO: This is Radio Saigon. The city of Lang Dong has been under attack by rockets and heavy artillery since dawn. Air observation has revealed a tank unit moving towards the city, as well as two infantry divisions moving in from the highlands. Elsewhere, refugees from Nha Trang in the central highlands are expected to arrive at camps in Vung Tau today. Madame Ngai? Between 20 and 40,000 refugees... Come in. ...are anticipated. Thus concludes our broadcast today. I found him at the gate. Would you like to put your basket down? Do not be afraid. We are your friends. What is your name? He won't say. Well, if he has no name, then we'll have to call him by a number. Shall we call him "Seven"? It has a nice sound. Very good. No like "Seven." What do you like? Than. That has a nicer sound than "Seven." Why did you come here, Than? Did you come far? Perhaps we'll talk more later. Mother dead. Did she tell you to come to me? Yes. Would you like to stay here, Than? Can I see what's in your basket? Ah, chicks. You are welcome to An Lac, and so are your little friends. Tell Trong to look after Than. Than needs a friend now. Yes, Madame. Madame? Yes? Baby is sick. Thank you. Come along, Lai. Madame Ngai? Later. (BABIES CRYING) When was the baby brought here? Just now. By who? Old woman found her in basket, behind shop. Papers? No papers. Hello, baby. (CRYING) She has fever. When the doctor comes, he is to see her first. What did you find out? The Vietcong are 35 kilometers from Saigon. President Thieu locks himself in palace. And... Is there more? Well... Go on. When I was at the hospital to get your medicine, they bring in the wounded, and Nam was there. Ba Day, take care of Lai. MADAME NGAI: Dr. Cao? Oh, hello, Madame Ngai. I want to see Lieutenant Vu Tien Nam. Of course. Please follow me. Te tells me you don't always take your medicine. I take it when I need it. And how is Nam? Not good. Here he is. Nam? Nam. You leave Saigon. It's going to be all right. You must rest. You leave Saigon. (COUGHING) People in North angry at you for take children to South. Do not worry. That is past. No. They put you on their list. They say you child-stealer. You no steal me. Shh. You... (COUGHING) Rest. Rest, my son. Nam is right. What will you do? I am not leaving without the children. I understand, but you must make some sort of plan. It's no longer safe for you here anymore. We are going to evacuate. The two American ladies, Betty Tisdale and Ina Balin, are coming. Oh, good, but there is not much time. They will find a way. I know it. Doctor? Yes? Take care of Nam. Don't worry, Madame Ngai. I'll try my best. Goodbye. Goodbye. What, Betty? Look, I can't hear you. (ANNOUNCER CHATTERING ON PA) Oh, oh, you heard, then. About the Babylift crash. They say it was Rosemary Taylor's orphanage. Oh, yes, Ina, I know. It was awful. If it hadn't been for the Air Force pilot, it would've been a lot worse. Yes, yes. I thought the same thing. Thank God it wasn't An Lac. You know what I mean. Oh, I do. But, you know, we have to hurry. Um, I read in the newspapers the Saigon government's in big shock about the whole thing. Listen, Betty, I have to go. They're calling my flight. I'm leaving now, too, so I'll see you soon. Oh, and don't forget to see Dr. Binh about the evacuation papers. All right. I won't. Have a safe trip. Bye-bye. CHILD: Goodbye, Mom. BETTY: Goodbye, boys. CHILDREN: Bye, Mom. Bye, Mother. Goodbye, darlings. Bye. Bye, sweetheart. ALL: Bye! PATRICK: Come on, guys, let your mom get into the car or we're gonna be late. CHILDREN: Be careful. Come back soon. I love you all. Take care of your father. Be careful. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye, Mom. Bye. ALL: Bye, Mom. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye, Mom. Bye, Mom. Bye! (SIGHS) I know I've forgotten something. Did you call the Shriners Hospital yet? Of course. And they're gonna take Kim Lan as soon as she's processed. Oh, that's great. Oh, and you're gonna call Fort Benning. We've gotta find a place for those children to stay before they're adopted. I know. Well, if worst comes to worst, they can always stay with us. (BOTH CHUCKLING) Oh, and, Patrick, in case I don't get military transport, keep trying to raise money for those planes. And don't forget to pick up the new English readers, and also... Cancel your church talk, then I'll pick up the cleaning, because Neil needs his good jacket for the school party. Then I'll take Lee in to the dentist. Anything else? (CHUCKLES) You're wonderful. I know. (BOTH LAUGHING) Just take care of yourself. Don't worry. After 14 years, I hope I know what I'm doing. Well, things are getting rough over there, Betty. I'll be fine, I promise you. By the way, I love you very much. I love you, too. Did you put the gold in your bag? It's here. Well, don't lose it. That may be the only way you'll be able to get out. Thank you. Yeah, sure. Thanks. Yeah, well, we'll talk. Be right back. Excuse me. Uh, Miss Balin? Do you mind if I join you? Oh, no. Please. I know everybody says this to you, but I really am a great fan of yours, ever since I saw you in From the Terrace. Well, thank you very much, Mr... King, Jerry. Or Jerry King, whatever you prefer. Number one newsman on the number one network, on his way to cover the fall of Saigon. Film at 11:00. (CHUCKLING) Well, it's nice to meet you, Jerry, uh, King. Well, now that we have that out of the way, what are you doing on a plane headed for Saigon? Well, I'm going to adopt a baby. (LAUGHS) You're what? I am going to adopt a baby. But I'm also going to help evacuate several hundred children from the An Lac orphanage. An Lac? In Vietnamese, it means "happy place." Well, what does your husband say about all this? Oh, I'm not married. But some of my friends think I'm a little crazy. Well, um, it does seem to be a very big job. I think we're up to it. Ah! Help. Who's "we"? Betty Tisdale and... Excuse me. I know the name Betty Tisdale. I... Why? Oh, well, she was Senator Javits's personal secretary. Ah, right. Yes. And she's helped fund An Lac since, uh, 1961. And she has five adopted Vietnamese daughters from there, not to mention the five sons that came with her husband. Uh, is anyone else involved? Madame Ngai. Over 20 years ago, with the help of Dr. Tom Dooley, she brought the An Lac children from North Vietnam to Saigon. And she's been running the orphanage from there ever since. You know, you're not gonna have an awful lot of time. The VC are moving very fast now. That's very true. There's another reason why we have to get the children out in a hurry. Some of them are, um, mixed blood. You know, Americans, French, etcetera. They're not treated very well by the South Vietnamese. You can imagine what the Vietcong will do to them. WOMAN: Excuse me. Excuse me. I never thought of that. Vietnam has a very big place in my life. Aside from three USO shows, I've been involved with An Lac for five years. Oh, I think it's great. I think it is wonderful. I think I will buy you a drink. Accepted. (RINGS) Peter, you want a hand with that gear? No, thanks, Jerry. Lenny and I will get it through customs. We'll meet you back at the hotel. JERRY: Here you go. Ina, it was nice meeting you. Oh. Take care. Thanks. Is someone meeting you? No, I, uh, I didn't know exactly when I was coming in, so I couldn't call. Well, then, it looks like we'll just have to give you a lift. It's a deal. (HONKS) I don't know how to say this. I know it sounds naive. I wish there was something that I could do to help. There is. We can use you. We have over 400 children who need parents. We can use all the publicity we can get back home. Publicity. We can handle publicity. Great. If I agree to help your kids, what do I say to these? Well, it's not possible to help everyone, so you help the ones you can. You have an answer for everything, don't you? No, I'm not trying to put you on the spot, really. It's all right. I used to ask myself the same question. And? And then I'd remember the faces of the children of An Lac. THUY: Be careful, they are very young. TRONG: Move over, move over. I bring food for chickens. THAN: Put down chickens to feed. Be gentle with them. Hey, Than. You'll like it here. You don't have to go to school. 'Cause of bomb. No bombs here. Don't be scared. You have mother, father? No one have mother, father here. Hey. This Mickey Mantle. American baseball player. Big shot. "Mickey..." Mickey Mantle. Where get Mickey Mantle? In hospital. American soldier give to me. You in hospital? Three years ago. Do you play ball? Hey, Than, how you like be my brother? I no have brother. I know, I be your brother. You be brother? Yeah, and we bunk together, too. B-bunk? Sleep. They bunk, too? With me, you? You bet. (CAR HORN HONKING) Come here, chicks. Come here. Come here. (VEHICLE APPROACHING) That must be Ina. Come along, Lai. (CHILDREN EXCLAIMING) CHILDREN: Hello, Miss Ina. Hello, Miss Ina. Take my purse, please. Hello! CHILDREN: Hello, Miss Ina. Hello. Hello, Miss Ina. Thuy! Oh! So happy to see you! Oh, it's great to see you. Madame's there, Ina. Oh, good. You stay here. I am so frightened. And I am glad you're here. So am I. How are you feeling? I get tired, but I'm fine. Do you take your insulin? Dr. Cao is a stubborn man. He told me that if I did not take it, he would put me in the hospital, away from all my children. (BOTH CHUCKLE) Oh. When will Betty arrive? Tomorrow, 3:00. Come. Wait, I want you to meet someone. Jerry! Jerry? Oh, please, would you come here a minute? (THUY SPEAKING VIETNAMESE) Madame Ngai, this is Jerry King. It's an honor to meet you, Madame Ngai. Jerry works for American television. Would you like the grand tour? (CHUCKLING) I'd love it, but I really do have to go to work. Madame Ngai, would you object to me bringing my camera crew here? You will show the film in America? Yes. Millions of Americans will watch it on television. That would please me. Perhaps it will help to get some of the children adopted. Thank you very much. Ina, I'll talk to you later. Oh... Ina, why don't you go to the nursery? I will see Mr. King to his car. Fine. Thanks a lot, Jerry. My pleasure, see you soon. Bye-bye. These are such beautiful children. It must have been hard for the mothers to just give them up. Mr. King, believe me, it is not easy. If our girls abandon their children, it is only because they can no longer care for them. I see. Kim Lan, this is a friend. Mr. Jerry King. Hello. Go on, dear. Is she shy? No, mute. I was told she saw her parents killed. Betty Tisdale has a special interest in her. She is sure we can get help for her in America. Oh, look at this sleepy baby. (BABIES CRYING) (GENTLY) Hello, hello. (BABIES CRYING) NGUYET: Miss Ina! You came back. Hello, Nguyet. (LAUGHING) I promised, didn't I? Yes. You're all grown up now. You did not see me in four years. Oh! You look fantastic. Nguyet, get these babies changed. Yes, ma'am. When you pick your baby, tell Thuy. She will make arrangements for the papers. All right. Thank you. Madame Ngai, I think I'd better go see Dr. Binh about the evacuation permits. Ina, it is Sunday. Government offices are closed. That's right. I lost a day. Come. I have a treat for you. Come along, Lai. We're here tonight only because I wanted you to have a very special dinner to celebrate your return to An Lac. (SOFT PIANO MUSIC PLAYING) Thank you. Oh, that looks delicious. It's one of the specialties of the house. Merci. You're such an incredible lady, Madame Ngai. No one else could've done what you have. I'm not the only one who has done something. It's simply a matter of conscience. After all, that is always what it is. Conscience is what has made Betty a devoted mother to the children of An Lac. Conscience has brought you here to help me and the children. (EXPLOSION) (PIANO MUSIC STOPS) (PIANO MUSIC RESUMES) Are you frightened? No, not of the bombs, but of what will happen to me if I am taken by the Vietcong. You won't be taken. You're coming with us. I am not leaving unless all the children go with me. I know. The children are more important. They must get out. (BABIES CRYING) Pick the baby up. It's okay. Don't cry. Don't cry. Ina, whichever one you choose for your own, you will love. Oh, I love them all. But these two are very special. You have time to decide. Go get some rest. I will see you in the morning. (BABY CRIES) (GENTLY) Oh, oh, do you want to go to sleep? Okay. Look at you. Hello. Hi. (BABY CRIES) Okay. Shh. Okay. Madame very weak these days. She tries to hide it. Ever since she find out about Vietcong death list, she not same. Death list? I think she tell you. Please no say I tell you. I won't. She take children from North. She friend with Americans. Please, no tell. INA: Okay. Thank you, Lee. You're welcome. I'll wait for you around corner, Miss Balin. Okay. Miss Balin. It's indeed a pleasure to meet you. I'm a big fan of American movies. Why, thank you. Betty's spoken so highly of you. Please sit down. Well, I think equally highly of Mrs. Tisdale. Now, if you will forgive me, I must get right to the point. I'm afraid, Miss Balin, that you have come too late. The ceiling of the children was reached last night. What do you mean? No more children will leave Vietnam except by special permit. And then it will take time, and they will leave in groups of 10 or 15 at most. But what about all of the work Mrs. Tisdale has done? Raising money for planes, arranging housing for children. And Madame Ngai. This is not an easy decision for her. She has always believed that An Lac was a family that should remain in Saigon. But now she knows that there is no longer any choice if the children are to be saved. Oh, please, Dr. Binh, you must reconsider. I'm sorry. The decision has been made. And we all have to live with it. You must respect the government's decisions or you will receive no help from us. But if the Vietcong reach Saigon, Madame Ngai will be killed. Surely you're aware of that! Miss Balin, if the Vietcong reach Saigon, many of us will be killed. And now, if you'll excuse me, I have many things to do. Please give my regards to Mrs. Tisdale. Why are you not playing, Than? Father and me play game like that. I know you're sad, but sometimes it helps to talk about it. But why dead, Madame Ngai? War is hard to understand. But should not die. Than, listen to me. Yes? Someday you will remember the good things you did with your parents. Playing with your father, going to market with your mother, and all the happy times you had together. Trust me. Every time you remember how much they loved you and how good they wanted life to be for you, then you will be strong. They would want you to be strong. I try. Good. And you know you can always talk to me. Madame Ngai? Yes, Thuy? New baby is dead. You try to go play with the boys, Than. Take her to the convent and ask sister Jeanne-Marie to see to the burial. Go. (CHATTERING) INA: Madame Ngai? Yes? How was Dr. Binh? Oh, all right. Everything's gonna be all right. What did he say? Well, there... There are a few formalities, but I think everything's gonna be all right. (EXPLOSION) (ROCKETS SCREECHING) Come on! Hurry up! Get up! Hurry up! (SCREAMING) (DISTANT EXPLOSION) MADAME NGAI: Children, go back to play! Te, you were near the bombing? Too near. On way back from convent. There was one of our pilots tried to kill President Thieu at palace. The president is alive? Yes. Only some damage to palace. You must go. Betty will be waiting. Oh, I'm late. No. Better I go. People scared by bomb. Big mess in streets. I'll be careful. Ina, if you get into trouble, call Senator Nhung. He owes me a favor. If he's not there, try Minister Vu. All right. Don't worry. WOMAN ON PA: Philippine Airlines flight 64 arriving at gate five. Philippine Airlines flight 64 arriving at gate five. (WOMAN SPEAKING VIETNAMESE ON PA) Betty! Ina. Oh, am I glad to see you! I was so afraid I was gonna be late. And I was afraid I was gonna have to spend the rest of my life in the Manila airport. The pilot suddenly decided he didn't want to fly into the middle of a war. WAYNE: Ina. Wayne! Oh, I don't believe it! How are you? I'm fine. It's great to see you. What a surprise! What am I talking about? What a relief! This is Captain Ed Bensman, our logistics man. Hi. INA: Well, hello, Ed. How are you? How did you get roped into this? Betty said I volunteered. (ALL LAUGH) Do we have the bus? No, I'm sorry. Oh. Well, then, we'll have to get a cab. Right. You two catch up with us, okay? BOTH: Okay. How'd you get McKinney? What a coup. He wanted to come. You can't spend two years at An Lac and not get hooked. Madame Ngai will be thrilled. How's she doing? Okay, all things considered. She'll be much better now that you're here. Did you see Dr. Binh? Oh, I saw him. What happened? Well, it's not good. They don't want to let the children out. Well, not all of them, anyway. I can't believe it. How many can go? Well, we have to get a special permit, and then possibly in groups of 10s and 15s. That's ridiculous. I know, Betty. I tried to think of everything. I just don't know what we can do. Ina, those children, all of them, are coming home with us. (SINGING IN VIETNAMESE) Bravo! Thank you. Who wants to help me with my luggage? ALL: Me! ED: Let's get this organized. Now, wait a minute. Come on! Okay, who's taking this? Whoa, whoa, whoa! Kim Lan. It's so good to see you! You get more beautiful every year. You wanna come and help me unpack? Okay, let's go. Everybody walking slowly. WAYNE: You want to take these? Okay. All right. (CHATTERING) Ed! Ed, ladies first. Now, come on. WAYNE: Nobody drink. Nobody drink. Now, is this the fourth or the fifth round? Oh, come on, Madame Ngai, nobody's counting. Come on, come on. Yes. Fill it up. The poor man's thirsty. (ALL LAUGHING) Moi. Now, I have another. Another what? Toast. Oh, Wayne, come on. We're all toasted out. No, no. This is serious. To Dr. Tom Dooley. Oh. To Tom. To the man who saved me and my children. To Dr. Dooley. I wish I had known him. Cheers. Come, Betty. I have a special food for you. Oh, thank you. Mmm. Beautiful INA: This looks great. I think we better get down to business. All right. What's first? Well, we should start with the paperwork. We need a list of all the children. There are some sick babies, but I'm sure they can be moved. I'll check each child to make sure they're fit to travel. However, there is the premature baby that we must make special arrangements for. All right, I'll check her out first. MADAME NGAI: Him. Him. What about the planes? We can get a 747 for $325,000. INA: Terrific. Well, Patrick and I have already raised half that. But if we're lucky, we can get military transport. Great. But enough business, let's eat. Wayne? This looks fantastic. Yes, please. Oh, wow. Excuse me. Stealing my chopsticks. Hi. Hello. I see you're still up. I can't sleep. I can't either. Want to walk? Okay. You know, Ina, I've been coming to An Lac for the past 14 years. And every year I keep telling myself that I'm doing some good, that I'm helping these children. Then I come back the next year, and the war's still going on, and there's even more children, and everything is just the same. It's enough to get a good old Pittsburgh girl down. But think of how it would have been without you. (SIGHS) I know I've helped them. It's just that I'm not so sure I'm doing the right thing by taking them out. Look, you have tried and you care. Which is more than most people. Besides, what choice do you have now? I'm gonna miss coming back here every year. I've really grown to love these people. I know how you feel. But aside from your husband and children, I know you'll find something very worthwhile to fill your time. I suppose. I'm sorry I'm so down. I guess what's really bothering me is this whole thing is finally coming to an end. But it's been worth it. Have you chosen your baby yet? There are two. It's hard. They're all so beautiful. I know. Do you wanna know how I chose my Laura? I was walking through the nursery and I just couldn't decide. And I bent over a crib, and she was the only one that was still awake. And she looked up at me and, suddenly, the biggest smile came across her face. And she just closed her eyes and fell asleep. That's lovely. I'm sure you'll be there and something will happen, and you'll know exactly which one is the right one. I hope so. What's the plan for tomorrow? What about Dr. Binh? I don't know. I'm afraid we're gonna have to go to the top. To Dr. Dan. He's the deputy prime minister. Do you know him? No. (INA CHUCKLES) Sounds like a big day tomorrow. I'm gonna say good night to Kim Lan. See you later. Okay. BOTH: Good night, Miss Ina. Good night. Oh. Oh, I've missed you so much. Sorry we haven't had a moment alone since I arrived. Patrick and the children are waiting for you at home. It won't be long now. It's late. Better go to sleep. I'll see you in the morning, all right? I love you very much. Good night, sweetheart. Dr. Binh. Ah, Mrs. Tisdale, Miss Balin. I'm glad to see you again. I'm late. Dr. Binh, we need more help. We must talk to Dr. Dan. Could you... Mrs. Tisdale, I'm sorry. I cannot help you with the children. There. Dr. Dan's secretary. The woman with the blue Áo Dài. Excuse me if I seem abrupt, but I'm in a hurry. Thank you, Dr. Binh. I understand, and I'm terribly sorry, but he is not in today. I don't even know when he'll be returning from the camps. The refugee situation is very bad, you know. Will it be possible to see him when he returns? Well, there are many ahead of you, but if you want to wait... Let me know if there's anything else I can do. Thank you. Can I buy you a drink? (SIGHS) Next week. (INA CHUCKLES) Betty. Oh, Ruth. It's nice to see you again. Ina, this is Ruth Cho. Ina Balin. I'm very pleased to meet you, Miss Balin. Betty's told me a lot about you. We'd better get out of the way. Yeah. Oh. Ruth has been a great friend to me and to An Lac. Ruth, we've got to see the ambassador. We're in trouble. The South Vietnamese government won't allow us or anyone else to evacuate more children. The Ambassador is not in. He's meeting with President Thieu. But he wants to help, as soon as he has the time. That's the problem. There is no time. Believe me. He'll do something. I'm sure he will. You will try and get us an appointment with him? I'll try. I'm sorry. Bye, Betty. Miss Balin. Miss Cho. Well, what now? Planes. That means Glen Manners. He'll be able to get us military transport. Betty, my hands are tied. I'll need a written approval from the South Vietnamese. It must be in writing with a seal. Okay? Okay. Just remind Binh or Dan to send it over. When do you need the papers? Look, I might be able to get a couple of C-141s late tomorrow afternoon. Get me written approval by, say, first thing in the morning, and they're yours. That's perfect! Oh, I could kiss you! Well? (LAUGHS) Oh! That's terrific. We'll get back to you. Bye. Thank you! Oh, Betty? Remember, if the VC get too much closer, those planes aren't gonna be able to get in or out. MADAME NGAI: Take off your shirt. TRONG: My brother must look good for America. All the children must look good for America. Even you, Trong. Don't worry. I look good for America. That shirt's too big for him. Thank you. It will fit you. Betty, are you sure he's coming out this way? I don't know. The secretary said this is where his car picks him up. Well, I guess he can't be too much longer. You know, there's something I've been wanting to tell you. I mean, things are so bad now, I can't make them much worse. What is it? It's about Madame Ngai. Tell me. She's on the Vietcong death list. Are you sure? Thuy told me. Madame Ngai doesn't want anyone else to know. Tsk. That's great. Just great. (SIGHS) Well there's no doubt now. She's gotta come with us. (HONKING) Here he comes! DR. DAN: Why don't you tell our Minister of Personnel to rush the processing of the refugees? BETTY: Dr. Binh! Mrs. Tisdale. Hello. Dr. Dan, these are the American ladies who are concerned with evacuating the An Lac children. Mrs. Tisdale, it's good to meet you. Yes. It's nice to meet you. I've heard so much about you. Thank you. This is Miss Balin, Dr. Dan. Miss Balin, it's a pleasure. Nice to meet you, sir. Dr. Dan, could you spare a few moments? We need to talk to you about An Lac. Oh, I am aware of the situation at An Lac, and I appreciate your concern, but at this very moment I am on my way to a meeting. Forty-two thousand refugees have just arrived here, and their situation is, uh, desperate. It's desperate for An Lac, too. The planes will be arriving late tomorrow afternoon, and all we need is permission to take the children out. May I remind you, there are procedures that have to be followed. I realize that, Dr. Dan. But if the Vietcong come any closer, it'll be impossible to get the planes in. And I've just learned that Madame Ngai is on the Vietcong death list. So are many of us, Mrs. Tisdale. DR. BINH: Dr. Dan. Excuse me. We are already late. All right, do this for me. Provide a proper identity paper for each child, proving that it's an orphan or has been abandoned. Have them on my desk in the morning, and I'll review them. INA: And then? If the papers are in order, the children may leave. We need written permission. Tomorrow. Tomorrow, I'll go to An Lac personally. Now, if you'll excuse me. He said yes. He did say yes, didn't he? Well, I think so. Come on! (LAUGHING) ED: We're on our way! BETTY: Madame Ngai! Good news at last! It seems as though we'll be leaving tomorrow. It is good news, Betty. No problem? Doesn't look like it. We'll be getting written permission from Dr. Dan tomorrow, as soon as we give him the identity papers on each one of the children. INA: And once we have those, the planes will be booked. ED: Fantastic! Well, there's lots to do. Let's go to work. Madame Ngai! What is it? Children do not come to An Lac clutching government documents. (THUY SPEAKING VIETNAMESE) (BOTH SPEAKING VIETNAMESE) How's it going? This is terrible. I'm afraid we no have paper in the morning. Thuy. Thuy, it's all right. It's all right. Look, we'll just do what we can. We'll give them any information we have. Names, birthplaces, anything. What we don't have, we'll make up, all right? We'll make one complete-looking document, like a manifest. Thuy, I wish I could read Vietnamese, so I could help you. Ina, it's no help even if you read Vietnamese. Paper no birth date. Well, do like Betty said. Make it up. All right. We try our best. Why don't you take a break first? No. No stop. Paper must finish. All right. We'll be right back. We'll get you some tea. (SPEAKING VIETNAMESE) Look. It's nice, isn't it? Oh, it's sweet. I'll tell you one thing. I've worked for this orphanage all these years. I'm not about to let it go down the drain. These children are coming with us tomorrow, whether the government likes it or not. Have you decided on your baby? No. Not yet. Well, there's no need to choose now. They're all coming with us. I think I'll go take a peek. Okay. See you later. Hello, Ba Day. Hello. Hi. (BABY CRYING) Aw! Here. Ohhh! Come on. You are so beautiful. Do you wanna come home with me? Pretty one. You like her? Yes. Be your baby? I think so. But you know, Ba Day? I like this one, too. INA: It's so hard to decide. I know. (BABY WHIMPERS) What are you doing up? Well, what are you doing awake, huh? You should be asleep. You have a big day ahead tomorrow. (BABY CRYING) Good night. (BABY CRYING) I'm sorry, Betty. May I take this? Mmm-hmm. Betty, how is it going? We're making a manifest of all the children. Good. I hope it helps. Listen, Betty, we have to talk. Sure. Nobody's told me what's gonna happen with the special children. Special? Yeah. The ones with brain damage and congenital problems. We take them with us. WAYNE: Betty, you know we can't do that. Of course we can. We just tell them we made a mistake, or you forgot to write the report, or... We can't lie to them. They might refuse entry to all the children. I won't leave them. We can't move children who would become wards of the state. Now, you know that. They are not gonna become wards of the state, Wayne! I'm going to find homes for them, and you know that. Oh, stop dreaming, Betty. I won't do it. (SIGHING) Madame Ngai. I'm afraid we're going to have to leave those children behind until I can make other arrangements. No. All the children are going or none. (DOOR CLOSING) Trong. Go to sleep. I never been on a plane. It's nothing. But what if they shoot at our plane? Who's gonna shoot at orphans? I saw a plane fall down from the sky once, and everybody got dead. Stop worrying. As long as I'm on that plane, you've got nothing to worry about, okay? Oh. But I'm still scared. I'm your brother, and you've got nothing to be scared of. All right. Go to sleep. Madame Ngai. I may not live with these children year round, as you do, but they live with me. In my heart, in my mind, all the time. All I do, every moment of every day, is to try and find ways to help them. And now you would leave some of them, the ones most in need. I'll find homes for those children, I promise you. It's just gonna take a little time. Is that what I say as they watch the others leave tomorrow? Should I tell them, "You are different"? "You are not worthy to go to America"? No. You tell them the truth. That we're only human. That we can only do so much at one time, and that we'll come back for them. We won't forget them! And you expect those words to be enough? Look. We're not gods. We have our limits. We--we can't set everything right. And that means we better take advantage of what we can. Meaning that those children must stay. Yes. As I have said many times before, I will not leave without all the children. If you wait too long to come back for them, they may just decide to prefer me to America. They'd be crazy if they didn't. Is Dr. Dan in? Oh, Mrs. Tisdale. No, he's not here, but we're expecting your papers. Everything seems to be in order. I'll see that Dr. Dan gets this right away. Thank you. Thank you very much. (CHATTERING) ED: Oh, great. Baskets. Ask him how many baskets he's got. (SPEAKING IN VIETNAMESE) How many has he got? Forty or forty-five. Great. Tell him we'll take 'em all. Lee, you pack 'em in the bus. We need about 70, so we'll go look for some more, okay? Okay. Ah. Anything else we need? Yeah, diapers. Lots of diapers. (WHISTLES BLOWING) All right, you. Trong? Please move this tape to whatever shirt you wear when you're ready to leave. All right? And don't take this wristband off. I know. He Than. He my brother. You no have brother. He's my brother. I adopted him. Well, if you adopted him, then of course he's your brother. Come on, Than. Go on. (CHILDREN CHATTERING) (CAR HONKING) TRONG: Miss Ina, Miss Ina! Look! American TV come! Thuy, you keep going. I'll be right back. Hi. Morning. Well, how's it going? (GROANS) That well, eh? You know the old story? Too much to do and not enough time to do it in? No, but if you hum a few bars, I'll fake it. Oh, Jerry. What I don't need now is jokes. Now, this is serious. This woman has lost her sense of humor. Hey! How would you guys like a trip to California? We need escorts. One adult for every 10 children. Be a great exclusive story! You need us, eh? Yes! Okay. I'm in. What about you, Pete? PETER: Sure. What could be more fun than 18 hours in a plane with 400 screaming kids? Lennie? Oh, you're fabulous. Thank you. Now I have to get this cleared with the network. And we have a couple of guys in Bangkok who are ready to go home. Maybe they can cover for us here. Okay. You're lifesavers. I've gotta get back to work. Why don't you come and shoot this tagging? Okay. (CHUCKLING) Did we agree to what I think we agreed to? We did. (LAUGHING) Well, come on. Let's go. Now pay attention, children. This is very important. Do you all have bags? GIRLS: Yes, ma'am. Fine. I want you to listen carefully. First, put in your change of clothes and then your toothbrush. Is that clear? GIRLS: Yes, ma'am. Ask Thuy if you need any help. Here, Ong, you can do it yourself. Come along, Nguyet. THUY: (CLAPPING) Now, girls, go back to your beds and do your packing. Come on. Back to your beds. When you finish packing, all go outside and play. What's going on here? This is not yours. Do your packing and go outside and play. Hurry up. (CHILD COUGHING) Leave your bag on your beds and then go outside. All of you. Hurry up. You are not packed, Mai. What's the matter? Mai? Don't you want to talk to me? Well, I'm going to talk to you. What is this? I no want go. America is very fine place, Mai, and we will all be with you. When we come back? I don't know. Perhaps when our country is our again. I tell you my little secret. Me, too. I cried when I realized that I had to leave. So not leave! Mai, many years ago, when North and South Vietnam were divided into two parts. That time, I was a young girl like you. I said the same thing to my beloved father. "Why do we have to go?" He squeezed my face. "My little one. "Someday, when you grow up, you will understand. "We have to leave to survive." Did he go with you? No. He could not. You no go, I no go. This time, we all go together. But I don't want to go. None of us want to go, but now we have to leave our country for the sake of our freedom and our dignity. I scared. So am I. ED: Okay, now come on. Let's keep 'em lined up here. Come on. Pick 'em up. Bring 'em over here. Let's line 'em up. Come. Line 'em up. You're pretty good at this, aren't you? Of course, I do it all the time. Line 'em up, fellas. Come on. Keep 'em lined up. Come on. What did he say? What did he say? He didn't say anything because he wasn't there. His secretary said that everything seemed to be in order. Oh, Betty, that's wonderful. Miss Ina, look. Name run on tape. Only the one have bath. Hey, what you doing? Why sweep here? Because we leave. We leave place clean. Why sweep if leave? Because Madame say so. Why? Madame want place leave clean. We sweep in America? Too many questions. Back to work. Okay, hon. Thank you. Bye-bye. Mine no good. I know, sweetheart. That's why we have to give you a new one. Where's your tape? I don't know. Oh. What's your name? Wu Ji Lin. And your birthday? May 30, '66. Okay, Lin. (SIGHING) I thought this would never end. She's the last one. All right, Lin? Now, don't take off this bracelet and leave the tape right where it is, okay? Thank you. Bye-bye. Thank you. I'm tired. For you. Oh, Nguyet! You need the prettiest basket for prettiest babies. Thank you, darling. Thank you, Kim Lan. Two? Well, Betty, I was thinking. If you can take care of 10, I can take care of two, I think. (CHUCKLES) (CAR HONKING) Good afternoon, ladies. BETTY: Hello, Dr. Dan. It's nice to see you again. Did you receive our manifest? Yes, very fine. Oh, thank you very much. And did you bring the signed documents? Of course. Oh. And I wanted to do it personally to let you know that I share your concern for these children. Thank you. Our security guards at the airport have been notified to let you through. Hey, that's great. We've been going crazy getting everything together. Dr. Dan, will you stay for tea? That's most kind, but I must be going. I may, however, join you at the airport later to make sure that no problems arise. Problems? DR. DAN: Well, I'm sure you'll see that I was not able to obtain approval for all the children, Madame Ngai or the staff. Approval is given only to the children under the age of 10? BETTY: Dr. Dan, we cannot accept this. I'm sorry, but a judgment was made that the older children will be needed in this country. Excuse me, Dr. Dan, but who made that judgment? The Ministry of National Defense. You must try to understand that we need the older boys to fight. They must defend our country. Our older girls are our future, our potential for growth. As for Madame Ngai, I'm truly sorry, but she must stay and help. She's a great symbol, and our people need her. This decision affects perhaps only 200 of the children. Those children are still orphans. I understand your feelings, but I did the best I could under the circumstances. But you cannot separate brothers and sisters. I'm sorry. No one over 10 may leave. My government has given me specific instructions. (BABIES CRYING) This baby can go, and this one. Madame Ngai. And this one. What are you doing? Not this one. Let the premature babies stay. Stop that. Everyone under 10 is going. We've been through hell to get this far, and you're not gonna cause any more problems now. It cannot be. These are my children. Madame Ngai, you can't spoil it for all of them. Some of these children have a possibility of a future. You're not gonna deny them that, are you? I say who goes and who stays. Fine. Then I'll leave you to explain what happens when no more money comes from America. You can tell them that your pride is responsible for them running out of food, clothing, medicine and books, okay? Will you tell them that? That you're so stubborn, you'd just as soon see them all suffer so that you don't have to admit that you're no miracle worker, that you're just not big and strong enough to take care of the whole world. I don't know why I behaved like this. I'm sorry, Betty. I'm sorry, too. (SIGHING) I didn't mean to be so cruel. All right, Betty. All the babies can go. Me no go. Than. You're under 10. You should go. No. Why don't you want to go? Me stay brother. You no have brother. You no have brother. You brother! You be brother! Played game with you. You cry when come here. When I make you brother, cry no more. Just... Just a game. Than! No. I go. Nguyet, start loading the children on the bus. And start the babies. Madame Ngai, we have to talk about Nguyet. What about her? I think she should go with the others. No. Why not? There's a good chance she won't survive if she stays. You know that. No! Nguyet has been with me for many years. She will be safe here. Madame Ngai... It is only fair. Madame Ngai, I beg you. This is a special case. There are no special cases. Nguyet stays. And she is over 10. But please... She stays. (BABIES CRYING) Madame Ngai, shall I take Lai to the bus? No. I will take her myself. Ba Day, stop crying in front of the children. I'm sorry, Madame. Go have the cook prepare a special supper tonight for the children returning from the airport. No more babies? We will always have babies at An Lac. Let's have something with that good, sweet sauce. Yes, Madame. WAYNE: Are they the last? That's it. You know, it almost seems cruel to let older kids go along just for the ride. The older ones want to go. Besides, it may relax the others. You realize that depending on how careful Dr. Dan is at the airport, there's a good chance that we can get some of the older kids on those planes, too. You think so? I'd bet on it. All those kids, all the commotion? I bet we could. No, no. We better not. We take the rest of them out legally. And Madame Ngai, too. Well, it's up to you, but I think it's worth a try. Betty? Thank you, Ed. What about Nguyet? This is probably the last chance she'll have. You know the Vietcong won't take kindly to a half-black. But we just... She's right. (SIGHING) All right. If we get the chance, we'll try and take her. Madame Ngai doesn't want to let her go. We just have to get her past her, too. Well, lots of luck with that one. Look, I'd like to spend some time alone with Kim Lan. (SIGHING) Oh, sweetheart. It's a very difficult time for both of us. You can't speak to tell me how you feel, but I know. Because I feel the same. Please, please take care of yourself. And know that I'll try to get you out somehow. I'll try to get all of you out. I promise. (SIGHING) I love you very much. Nguyet! Nguyet! NGUYET: Come on, come on. Quick, quick. Quick, quick. Come on, come on. Come on, come on. Come on, come on. (CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING) (PEOPLE CHATTERING) (BABIES CRYING) (CRYING) (PEOPLE CHATTERING) Why can't we use the baskets? Well, they think someone may have planted a bomb in them. (SIGHS) (BABIES CRYING) Dr. Dan, are there any new developments? No, no. Everything is the same. Thank you very much, sir. No changes. Excuse me. Good afternoon, ladies. How is everything going along? As well as can be expected. (SHOUTING IN VIETNAMESE) (CHILDREN CRYING) Wait here. (MAN SHOUTING IN VIETNAMESE) Nguyet. Nguyet, come! Ina, take her with you. Quick! Nguyet, grab a baby. Get on that plane and hurry up! Stay there! (SPEAKING IN VIETNAMESE) One of the bus drivers tried to stow away in the lavatory. Ladies, I'm sorry things didn't turn out quite as well as we hoped. But I know we all tried our best. Mrs. Tisdale, goodbye. Goodbye, Dr. Dan. Miss Balin. Thank you, Dr. Dan. Good luck to you all. Madame Ngai. I'm going with you. (BABY CRYING) Sit down. Sit down. I don't want you to be my brother! Kim Lan? Lai, go with Kim Lan. Take her. Go. Ladies, we gotta go. MADAME NGAI: Thank you, Captain. Thank you. Don't worry. We'll be back. Goodbye, Madame Ngai. Dr. McKinney. Don't forget me. Take care of your little ones. I'll expect you to celebrate their first birthdays with them. God bless you, Madame Ngai. I love you. TRONG: Miss Ina? What, Trong? Please give this to Than when he a little bit older. He'll understand. I will. Bye-bye. Take care. Yes. I will be fine, but it is you who must make sure that my children are well in your America. Or you will answer to me. Yes, ma'am. I love you, Madame Ngai. I love you, too. Betty, please do not forget me. You know I won't. Bye, darling. Betty! (BABIES CRYING)
