Perfect. My life was perfect and beautiful and blessed. There was nothing extraordinary about the end of that day, nothing to prepare US for the coming night... The night that for some of US would last forever. I believe that if we are still and listen, we can hear the voice of god. This is the story of how I learned to listen. Okay. Got it. H-Hello. J-Just say it. Oh, no. Stop it. No, stop it! Stop it! We can't do anything. We can't go. They won't let US near him. We're supposed to stay here, stay by the phone, and wait. - Wait? - Mm. Oh, lord. Wait. You used to do that when you were little. What? Do what? Stand there in front of that fridge swinging the door back and forth, trying to decide what to eat. Yeah. You always told me decide what I wanted before I opened the door. Still makes absolutely no sense to me. Does Stephanie let you do that at home? Stephanie can't tell me what to do. She's not my mother. How are they doing, anyway? I haven't seen them since the last time we went bowling. Jj's always got something going on with school or church. Stephanie takes him everywhere. So how did I rate this visit anyhow, huh? Where are you heading? Over to the new subdivision. Yeah. They hit me again last night. Again, that same subdivision? Yeah, same one. Every house they hit costs me about $6,000. So why don't the police do something about it? Eh, police can't do nothing with copper thieves unless you catch 'em in the act. Plus, they ain't got the manpower to keep an officer there on-site, so... So? So I'm gonna sit out there and watch. No. Jason, tell me you're not serious. Will you get that look off your face? You and Steph. Now, look, all I'm gonna do is hide and watch, and if anybody comes up, I'll just call the police. You know, they said they'd have an officer patrolling the area. He'll come right over. Mom. Mom, I have to. It's secluded out there, right? Whoever's doing this just gonna keep coming back. I'll just watch, and nothing's gonna happen to me. Well, I'm gonna say a prayer for you anyhow, just to make sure you're not alone out there tonight. Everything's fine out here. All right. I'll talk to you later. Bye. They're here. Lord, please no. Stephanie? Miss Jackie, he's dead. The man-- that man died, and Jason's been arrested and taken to jail, and they're saying that he-- it's okay. They're saying that-- Jackie, this is Ellis. Are you listening to me, Jackie? Look, I've spoken to the judge, and, um, Jackie, I've got some things to say to, uh, you and Larry, um, but I don't want to do it over the-- Ellis, Ellis, you talk to me right now. Talk to me. Jackie, do you want to see Jason? You want some music? You want some music on? Honey, Ellis knows what to do. No. No, he don't? No music. Okay. He don't know. He--he don't what? He don't know what to do. Ellis? He is just Jason's real estate attorney. He closes on houses. He can't help. He's a good man, though, smart. Yes. Yes, smart? Music. * somebody's praying for me * I don't think I can-- Stephanie, what is it? ...can do this. I don't think I can. Just don't think about yourself. Just think about Jason and how you can help him, okay? And remember this. He's inside. He can't do a thing, so don't put anything on him. He's helpless. Jason's depending upon you. Anyone headed to cellblock "a," step this way. All of you with a card marked "a," come with me. Jason! Jason! It was an accident! - Jason, pick up the phone! - I wish I'd never... - Pick up the phone! - Jason! Jason, baby, listen to me. Honey, pick up the phone. You're gonna get through this, okay? You are gonna get through this. You're just gonna have to be strong, all right? Remember when you told me--when you told me that you were gonna go out to the site? I told you I was gonna say a prayer for you just in case, right? Baby, that means you were not alone out there, and you are not alone in there now. Sweetheart, listen. As soon as we get out of here, we're gonna have you out on bond, okay? Okay? We're gonna get you out on bond, okay? Okay? Talk--talk to him. How's jj doing? He's fine, honey. He's just confused. What did you tell him? Not much, not yet, anyway. I don't know what to tell him. We'll have to talk to him, and I love you. Look at me, Jason. You have to come home to me. Bojangles, down! Hello. Mama? Okay. Okay. Well, what is it, mama? Just say it. Larry, mama says turn the TV on channel 32. It's coming up right now. Turn it on channel 32. ...on the very spot where just some 24 hours ago, these two men saw their cousin gunned down in cold blood. Mr. Morales, can you tell US in just a few words what happened on February the 29th? Um, we--we went to get something to eat, and then, uh, we come back to sleep so we can work on the house early in the morning. And then, uh, well, we were sleeping. A man walked up with a flashlight and knocked on our Van and, uh, told US to get out, and, um, he walked behind my cousin and--and shot him. He killed my cousin with his gun. And the questions continue in this shattered community as one family searches for the answers in this vicious and unprovoked attack. This is deaundria keana Kelly. ...channel 32... When we enter the courtroom, you're gonna sit on the left-hand side, immediate family in the front row. No talking. All rise. The honorable judge Henry strickland, superior court, state of Georgia, Crockett judicial circuit. Good morning, everybody. Please, sit down. Make yourselves comfortable. Having taken into account the written testimony of witnesses Mr. Morales and Mr. Lerma and the written report of Crockett county sheriff's deputy Clayton book and in light of the cross-examination made by both you, Ms. Pitt, and you, Mr. Burdette, I find the charge of felony murder will stand. Remove the defendant. Why'd they put shackles on him? Why-- what are you doing? Don't stop. I need charcoal. Go home. Take me home. Charcoal and vinegar. No. I don't want to be here. Friday, it's your birthday. I need charcoal for the barbecue, vinegar for the hot sauce. Everybody likes my hot sauce. No, baby. No. Not this year. Nobody's gonna be expecting you to. It's what I do. Hey, Jason. I don't know when you'll hear this. I know they took your cellphone. It's probably in a box somewhere with the rest of your things, but I just wanted to call it to hear your voice. It's mom's birthday. We're having a barbecue like-- like always, all your favorite foods. I can't eat it. I tried. I'll wait till you can eat it with me. Uh, I guess i-- I don't know. I just wanted to call and say that I miss-- miss my little brother. I mean, just look what a perfect day we've got for a barbecue. It's warm. I mean... Debbie, I don't think this was a very good idea. Just look around at all these people in your backyard. I mean, there's that rowdy little hinkle boy. Now, don't he come over after school and take bojangles for a walk? And I know Dr. Massey calls and checks on you every day. Don't you wish somebody'd tell him that plaid shorts and varicose veins don't go together? And you know what Cynthia's doing over the evenings. She's building a prayer chain, and she's called people from Georgia to New York, and there are thousands of people praying for Jason, people that we don't even know, and he don't know them. I mean, isn't that a miracle? Honey, you've got angels all around you, and I think that's a good enough reason to celebrate with potato salad and green jell-o. And when it just gets too much for you, just lean your head over on his shoulder, and say, "I'm tired." I think-- I think he likes it when we come to him like little kids. What was that song we used to sing? * little ones to him belong * * they are weak come on. You remember. * but he is strong * yes, Jesus loves me * yes, Jesus loves me * yes * Jesus loves me * for the Bible - tells me so. - * tells me so - What we got here? - What you looking at, man? You have got to get me out of here as soon as you can. I'm not gonna make it. Oh, get him out! Get him out now! - He is dying in there. - Jackie. He cannot take it another second. I want you to get him out now. How many times do I have to tell you this? Until his bond hearing, there is nothing you can do, nothing. Jackie? You so loved the world that you gave your only begotten son. But I cannot give mine... And I can't sit back and do nothing. Now, if you won't fix this, I will. I will. I will find a way. If you won't, I will. All right, then. Just long as you can. Listen. * I come to the garden alone * * while the dew is still on the roses * * and the voice I hear * falling on my ear * the son of god discloses * and he walks with me * and he talks with me * and he tells me I am his own * * and the joy we share * as we tarry there * none other has ever known * Just to let you know, your family's been waiting for you for some time, so let's get you all sorted. Grammy, if you think about something else, the time goes faster. You're gonna wear a hole in the floor, honey. Will daddy have the bomb when I see him? Bomb? What bomb? Grammy said we were going to get daddy out on a bomb. A bond, not a bomb. A bond is a way of bringing daddy home with US. And where do you want to take daddy for dinner? Spin-a-pin. You really think we should take him to a bowling alley on our first night home? How 'bout we take him someplace real nice to eat? Okay then. Baskin-Robbins. How 'bout we let daddy decide? Will he eat with US from now on? When we love somebody, they're always with US. Even when we can't see them with our eyes, we see them with our mind and our heart, don't we? So let's just look at daddy and see him as much as we can, look hard as we can. And when he's at work or when he's not right in front of US, he'll still be with US. Hey, mister. What are you doing to me? I'm looking at you as hard as I can. Jason, it's me. Jason, calm down. Look at me. I'm right here. It's okay, baby. I can't get used to it. Cold weather? No. Well, yes, that, too, but what I can't get used to is how you sell Jesus in the stores. Christmas come, and baby Jesus is everywhere. Then come 26 December, boom, he's 75 % off after-Christmas sale. Cynthia, I'm sorry. I just can't appreciate this, not today. Come on, look at this pretty scene with Santa and his suit in the snow. In Jamaica, we don't have that. You don't have Santa claus? Yeah, we have Santa, but no snow. We see a fat man in a red suit with white flakes on his shoulder, and we think dandruff. Sweetie, I appreciate what you're trying to do, but I just can't get my mind off the arraignment. Jason is there right now with that judge. Okay, so you want to talk about it, then. You want to be with him? Well, I can't. Only Jason and his attorney is allowed. So you want to do what you cannot do, so stop that. And what would you do if you could be there? - Nothing. - That's right, so why don't you do nothing here with me and let the law people do their job? Tell me about this new lawyer man. Mitchell Kane. Ellis says he's the best. He's got a really good track record in mur-- in cases like this. - Hmm. - He grew up around here, and he is an amateur magician. Musician? Magician. Oh, he pull bunnies out of hats. Maybe. And cut people in half with a saw? I guess. And make folks disappear? Yeah. I think I have a job for Mr. Kane after this trial is done. I just can't stand the thought of Jason being in that courthouse for any reason. I'll be better when he's back home. Do you think it's gonna make Jason feel happy to see his mommy's face all wrinkly with worry? Come on. We're here with all this pretty stuff. We might as well do something to make US smile. All right, I tell you what. I'll go to the ladies' room, and then we'll go out and get something to eat, something fattening, and it's my treat. Good idea. I'll wait here to see if I could find something for 100 % off. Jackie, my precious, I need for you to talk to me if you can. What is it? Just talk to me. The district attorney wants to indict Jason, felony murder. Yes, we all know that. And felony possession and aggravated assault. There's five charges now. Jackie. Jackie. So god has given you another load to bear. He will not give you more than you can carry, and he has given you people who love you, and we will not leave you. That's it. We just do, so let's get started on this climb. What's next? Kane wants to see US in his office. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Mr. Kane, Mr. Kane, can you tell US one positive thing about my son's case? What you want me to say to you is that this will all be over soon, that Jason will be exonerated from all charges and he'll be totally free to go back home to his family. I can't tell you that. But, Mr. Kane, what can you tell US? Well, I can tell you that district attorney pitt has offered to drop the felony murder charge for a voluntary manslaughter charge. Why? Why this change? All goes back to deputy Clayton book. He's the primary reason why you got charged with felony murder in the first place, but deputy book has been terminated. - Fired? - What? Why? As soon as the sheriff found out that deputy book had carried Mr. Morales and Mr. Lerma back to the alleged crime scene and that he'd spoken to the news about the incident, he started to sweat. Looked like he was trying to cover up something. Which he was. So the sheriff terminated deputy book before he can give the department a black eye. Now, since the d.A.'S case was based on book's accusations, this could weaken their case considerably in a jury trial. They're dropping the charges? - Not by a long shot. - I don't-- think what he's trying to tell US-- district attorney pitt and judge overby have agreed to reduce the felony murder charge to voluntary manslaughter. You will serve three to five years. And if you do not accept her plea bargain, the judge will try you at a bench trial. Either way, you are going to prison. She wants your decision soon. Let me make sure I've got this straight. The only reason all this is happening to Jason is because that deputy Clayton book lied, and now everyone, including the sheriff and the d.A. And the judge, all know that he lied, and they're still not gonna let him go? He takes the plea bargain, he gets nothing less than three years. He takes the jury trial, there's a 50/50 chance that he'll go to prison for at least 30. Can you tell me why my son's case gets weaker every time it strengthens itself? Jackie. Can you tell me why the termination of that deputy hurt the prosecution's case and it did not help ours at all? Can you tell me why my son should go to jail? Let me tell you why he should not go to jail. - He has a seven-year-old son... - I think Jason needs to listen to these attorneys and follow their advice. They know what's best for him. He has a wife who... You need to take the offer, son. Get it over with. You'll be back home before you know it. - Three years is nothing. - He is innocent! - He is innocent! - I just think it's the best thing to do to take the plea bargain. ...go to jail for something he didn't do! He needs to pay up and get it over with. Pay up? I just think the plea bargain-- he's not your son! When we finish with the trial, whether it be a bench trial or a jury trial... Mr. Kane, you'll go home to your wife and your family. Ellis, you'll go home to your wife. Larry, you'll go home to mom. I have to make this decision, me and Steph. Let's go home. Honey. I don't even know her name. What? A boy died out on that construction site. He has a mother. They won't tell me her name. She get a phone call like US in the middle of the night? I was wondering if she's sitting up right now. I don't even know her name. Mom, Steph and I have come to a decision about the plea bargain. Neither of US can get any peace about a bench trial. I know that i'm risking going to jail for 30 years taking that jury trial. But, mom, we ain't been able to say a word about what really happened... None of US. The story wants to be told. Putting it all out in the open, that's the right thing to do. It's what gives US peace. Mom, we're going to trial. Sweetheart, sweetie, Ellis has something he needs to tell you. Well, if it's bad news, Ellis, you're just gonna have to wait in line. Well, it's about the trial. Oh, just say it, Ellis. Well, Kane has asked that you-- all of US certain things. Kane feels, we all feel that you should not... Bring your--your Bible into the courtroom. If there are nonbelievers among the jury members, and--well, and they look at you and they see your Bible, it might offend them. Jackie, they could hold that against you. They could hold that against Jason. Well, uh... That was the main thing that I just was coming over for. What else do you want, Ellis? You want me to change my hair? You know, this length might offend somebody. What color outfit do you think I ought to wear? 'Cause blue might offend somebody, but red is bound to set somebody off. And how about if we do forget the Bible for those nonbelievers, Ellis? How about the believers? You know, I guess it all just comes down to who I'm going to offend, because I guarantee you I will offend somebody. Thank you, Ellis. I just didn't have enough on my plate today. No, I don't-- I think I took a wrong turn off of the exit. I am trying to find Kane's office, and--Larry? L-Larry? Larry, am I losing you? Oh, my--no. My pretty mom. You about ready to go back home? It is so good to see your face, Jim. Good to see you looking so much better. I hear they're kicking you out of here soon. Mm-hmm. 11:00. Be able to eat lunch on the outside again. Free woman. Well, I won't keep you from that, but I did have something I came by here to tell you. Last night, out of the clear blue, I saw words in front of my eyes, and these words were for you, and the message was this, that you are to move into and live in the book of psalms. Does that mean anything to you? Me either. But I bet it will. Will you do that for me, remember that message? Move into the book of psalms. Mm-hmm. Mm, and live there. Bye, Mary. Live it, Daniel. Yeah. You spoke on psalms today. Yes. I don't know what I'm supposed to do. You mean about bringing your Bible into the courtroom? I try too hard. Do your best, and let god do the rest. Have I? Done your best? Have I? More. I feel so small. Maybe that's a good thing. Lost. Can I help my mom? Go home. Hug your babies. My heavenly father... I'm so tired. I have done everything I know for my Jason. We all have. As much as I love him... I know you love him more. He's so heavy, my arms just can't hold him anymore. Take him from me. Take him into your arms. - Honey. - Baby? Did you take your meds? Did you take yours? Honey... Cuttin out psalms... Those are bibles. - Mm-hmm. - Um... Because I want them with me until this is over. I want to be able to touch them, and I want to have verses for everyone, you and Jason and Cynthia to hold. You--you could just copy 'em. Oh, no. No copies. We'll get more bibles. God won't mind. Honey? All rise. The honorable judge s. Carroll, superior court of the state of Georgia, Crockett county. Be seated. If the jury is ready, they may join US. Would you spell your name, please? B-double o-k, Clayton book. And, sir, by who are you employed? Employed by the city of ridgetop police department. And are you a post certified police officer? I certainly am. On February 28, 2008, were you called out to the vicinity of Gideon road and old betts road? I was. And why were you called out there? I was dispatched in reference to copper thefts. Did you meet with anyone out there? I met with Mr. Jason veitch, that man sitting right over there, raising his hand. And when you met with the defendant, Mr. Veitch, what did you find? Well, we were discussing how he was having trouble completing any of his homes in reference to the copper thefts. Did you and the defendant, Mr. Veitch, discuss what to do about these copper thefts? We did. Would you describe, please, what he had to say, questions he asked. Well, we were discussing how best to resolve the issue, and I told him what we frequently suggest is they install some type of surveillance cameras, like the deer still cameras, down near the homes. And how did the defendant, Mr. Veitch, respond? Said he didn't like that idea. Said he wanted to sit out and watch, try to catch 'em in the act. Did the defendant, Mr. Veitch, say that he was planning on being armed? Yes, he did. And did you talk about the concept of shooting these men? We did. He asked me if somebody showed up to steal his copper, was he justified in shooting that person? And how did you respond? Well, I told him no. And how did Mr. Veitch react to that advice? He was very upset when I told him he couldn't. Did you ever suggest to the defendant that as a remedy to these copper thefts, that he could hire some teenagers to catch and beat up these perpetrators? No. We never discussed anything at all about teenagers. And did you suggest to the defendant that he could make a citizen's arrest, that he could catch these men and tie them to a post? No, I did not. Did you talk more about shooting? Well, when I told him he couldn't shoot that person, he said, "well, can I just shoot 'em in the leg?" And I also explained to him that no, he couldn't. Would you describe the defendant, Mr. Veitch's demeanor during the course of your conversation? Well, he was very upset. He was unusually determined to make apprehension of the subject. To be blunt, he was in a rage. What? Why would he say that? We knew he'd be lying. It's okay. It's officer book? Yeah. Fine. Excuse me? Is that what I should call you, officer book? You could call me officer book, Mr. Book. Yes, sir. Why did you leave the Crockett county sheriff's department? Mr. Book? The official reason was unsatisfactory probationary period. Were you fired? No, terminated. Well, as part of your termination, were you told that your ability to make good decisions and use good judgments were unsatisfactory? Yes, I was. Were you told that you continue to make bad decisions that resulted in bad circumstances? Yes, I was. Were you told that you were insubordinate with an insubordinate attitude towards supervisors? Yes, I was. And were you told, Mr. Book, that you resort to intimidation in order to manipulate outcomes to your advantage? Yes, I was. And that you also damaged the reputation of your coworkers and other agencies? Yes, I was. You were also told that you demonstrated a job performance that was unsatisfactory. Yes, I was. Now, Mr. Book, before you were with Crockett, you were with the, uh, city of orlinda? That's correct. When you were up there and, uh, there's a reprimand, it's called a personal contact? That's correct. And you applied to Crockett county sheriff's department after receiving three personal contacts in one week up in the city of orlinda? I don't think that's accurate. You don't? No. I-- let me refresh your recollection by showing you out of your own personal file-- - okay. - No, no, no, no. - Let me show you a-- - I said I don't remember. Mr. Book... Part of your training as a police officer is to write reports when you respond to a complaint, correct? That's correct. Now, in writing these reports, you're supposed to put everything that's significant, correct? Pertinent information. Pertinent information. So you went out to old betts road on February 28, and you made out a report, and your report at 3:51 had only two paragraphs. Is that correct? - That's correct. - And nowhere in there do you say anything about him asking you to shoot anybody, do you? That's correct. And nowhere in there do you say that he intended to, uh, go out and stake it out himself. That's correct. And nowhere in there did you say that he was unusually determined to go and capture the violators himself. That's correct. So the fact that he was unusually determined to capture these men himself, intended to go out and stake out the property himself, intended to carry weapons, and seemed intent to shoot someone, none of this seemed pertinent? - No. - No? No. No. Mr. Book, were you at all concerned that if you had told Mr. Veitch to go and catch them himself, that you might have imposed some liability on the sheriff's department? Well, first of all, I would never tell somebody that. Well, right. You'd get in trouble if you were to tell somebody to go out and catch them himself, right? I would get into trouble if I were to tell somebody to take the law into their own hands and then afterwards somebody was to get hurt from it. Well, in this case, you did tell somebody to take something into their own hands, didn't you? And they did get hurt, didn't they? How? You tell me. You need to tell me exactly what you're referring to. Have you ever been called out to, um, burglaries or thefts in progress or drug deals, anything of that nature? Sure. And I know that police officers-- and I commend you for being a police officer. I really do. You guys have a tough job. Whenever you go somewhere, you never really know what's going to happen, do you? No. Always expect the unexpected. And you never know who was waiting for you, if somebody's going to be dangerous or armed, right? We don't ever know what's waiting for US, Mr. Kane. So when you do that, when you confront these people, I mean, what do you do? You draw a service weapon? If we feel like the likelihood that someone poses immediate threat, yeah. So then even a trained police officer would draw a weapon if he thinks himself to be in danger? Mr. Book? Mr. Book? You can call me officer book. Now, let's go to the gunshot wound. Based on your experience and training, Dr. Coffelt, you can tell exactly the degree of the angle? Yes. And also you can tell the angle of entrance? - Yes. - Now, I would like for you to turn your attention to this artist's model. Now, if you will take a look there, you'll see a hole drilled. It represents a bullet hole. Now, this hole was actually done by an engineer using your autopsy report. Does it appear to be an accurate representation of the wound? Dr. Coffelt? Yes. So if I were to insert this object into the hole representing the wound, we can tell exactly the angle in which the bullet entered the body? Yes. I believe you have a familiarity with shotguns. I'm not an expert on weaponry, but I do know how a shotgun works. Then you must know that a 12-Gauge shotgun has a pretty hefty kick. In order to fire it, you must place the stock against your shoulder to stop the kick. Would you agree with that, Dr. Coffelt? Yes. Oh, my, my. Seems we have an issue. Can you explain, doctor-- I mean, barring his ability to fly, can you explain how any human being could be shouldering a shotgun with his hand on the trigger when it was fired at this angle? Thank you very much, Dr. Coffelt. Can I do anything for you before I go? Tell me how to make it through the night. Precious, tonight when the devil comes in creeping with his deep, dark thoughts, ask god "what is the lesson? What am I to learn?" Be still, and know that he is god. Listen. Listen. Oh, I like that. Be still, and listen. Yeah, but, Cynthia... What if I say I can't do this? It don't matter a bit. God says you can. Tell US your name, please. Ernesto morales. Where are you from? Mexico. And how long have you been in this country? Like, 12 years. And why did you come to this country? To help my family and my parents. When you came to this country, did you learn a trade? Yes. And what trade is that? Drywall. And do you have a crew? Yes. - And who is on that crew? - Jose lerma and, uh, Juan Carlos reymundo. And Mr. Reymundo, is he the man who was murdered? - I object, your honor. - Sustained. My apologies, your honor. I will rephrase. Juan Carlos reymundo, is he the man who was killed on February 29, 2008? Yes. - Were you related to him? - Yes. And are you related to Mr. Lerma? Yes. He's my cousin, too. Now, Mr. Morales, were you and your two cousins working on a house on old betts road owned by Jason veitch, on February 29, 2008? Yes. And what time did you finish work on that day? About 10:00 at night. And what did you do then? Go to a store and buy lunch. And why is it that you went to the store to buy your lunch instead of returning home? Because we wanted to stay on the job. Where did you go to get something to eat? To a Walmart. And when you returned to the work site, what did the three of you do? We saw a car coming. And where did this vehicle go? Parked behind US. What did you see or hear? I heard when he shot his gun, and he started yelling for US to get out of the Van. And was this the same man who had pulled up in the vehicle behind you? No. He was coming from another direction. What happened next? Lay on the ground. And was the man with the gun who ordered you to get out of the Van, to get on the ground the defendant here on trial? Yes. Were you afraid? Yes. Then what happened? I heard a shot. Was anybody shot? Juan Carlos. When Juan Carlos reymundo was shot, did he say anything to you? "Cousin." After your cousin was shot, what did you say or do? I'm asking, "please help. Please call 911, call the police." What, if anything, did the defendant say or do? Told US to shut up, not to look at him. Had you tried to move before Juan Carlos was shot? No. - Had Juan Carlos tried to move? - No. Did someone pick up Juan Carlos? The man with the flashlight. And how did that man get Juan Carlos to his truck? Just pick him up from behind and, like, dragged him. Mr. Morales, I know that this is very difficult for you. I'm going to be as easy as I can. Will you answer some questions for me? On the evening of February 29, 2008, I believe you said that you stopped working around 10:00 that night. Yes. And then, well, help me out a little bit. You were questioned by the sheriffs? Yes. And you were in a little room, and they were videotaping it. Did you know that they were videotaping you? Yes. And did you tell the sheriff's deputy at that time that you had left around 8:00 or 8:30 to go get something to eat? No. So you told them on the videotape that it was 10:00? Yes. Mr. Morales, when you returned from eating at the Walmart on the night of February 29, didn't you turn off Gideon road and go all the way down old betts road, going by the construction site? No. Did you not then turn your vehicle around and go back down old betts road, passing by the house a second time? No. So you drove directly to the house? - Yes. - Mr. Morales, when you gave your recorded statement, did you tell the officer that you had forgotten where it was and that you turned the wrong way? I did not say that. I'm going to play a portion of your statement for you. If we can turn down the lights. We leave, like, 8:00 or 8:30, get something to eat. - And where did you go to eat? - Arby's. When you came back to the house after eating, did you come directly to the house? No. We--we drive around and around. Mr. Morales, why did you do that? Because we were talking a lot, and, uh, like, it's real dark, so we have trouble seeing, so we drive too far and go up to where you can turn around, and then we come back real slow, but we still don't find the house. So what do you do when you can't find the house on old betts road? We turn around again, and, uh, we--we pull over. That's where we turned off the Van. What'd you do after you turn off the engine? We turn off the lights, and we try to sleep. And you go to sleep there? No, because in a second, we--we can see better, and, uh, we--we start the Van again, and we go to the house. Oh, so you couldn't find the house - because it was dark? - Yes. Are you aware that many, many things you are telling US today are completely different from what you told the police on your videotaped interview? Yes. I--i remember some things. It's so long ago. I can't remember everything, just some things. No further questions, your honor. Do you have another witness to call? I do, your honor. I call bill flourney. And what is your name, sir? Billy flourney. And you live in Crockett county? Yes, ma'am. All your life? All my life. And are you related to the defendant, Jason veitch? I'm his father-in-law. Do you work for your son-in-law? Yes, ma'am, for almost eight years now. And what kind of work do you do for him? Well, I'm sort of like a handyman on his houses. And were you aware that these houses were hit by copper thieves about this time last year? Yes, ma'am. How did Jason veitch react when his houses were hit by these copper thieves? Well, ma'am, he didn't like it. Let me say this in a language you can understand. Did he express a reaction? Every time one got hit, he had to have the stuff replaced, and it was costing him a good bit of money. Did you know he was going out to old betts road on February 29? Yeah, he-- and what was he intending to do out there? He just said he was going to go out and see if he could help the law catch who's been stealing. On February 29, did you talk to him on the phone? Yeah. It was, you know, during the night. It was--you know, it was after midnight. And when he called you after midnight, what did he say? He said he was being robbed out on lot number three, and I asked him, I said, "have you called the law?" And he said yes. And I asked him, "do you want me to come over there?" And he said yes. And so when you got to Gideon and old betts road, what did you see? All I saw was a white Van. Did you approach the Van? I pulled up sort of close to the Van. And went up to the driver's door? - Right. - And you had a flashlight. Right. And what did you do with the flashlight? Started shining it at the Van. What happened next? Wasn't long before I heard a shot over in them woods to the left there. And after you heard the gun go off, then what happened? Okay, it seemed just a few seconds. I saw Jason walk up. And what was he doing when you first saw him? He had his gun, and it was aimed up high. Did he say anything? He come up, like I say, at the Van, and he started to order them out of the Van. Then what happened? After some time, they started coming out of the Van. How many came out of the Van? - Two. - And what happens when the two men came out of the Van? Things started to get tense, 'cause we could hear somebody rustling around in the Van, and they wouldn't come out. So when these two guys got out, did they make an aggressive action toward you? No. Did they make an aggressive action towards your son-in-law? Not that I can recall. Were you in fear for your safety because of these two guys? - Yes. Yes. - And why is that? Just the fact that I didn't know who they was out there in the middle of the night. I didn't know if they had weapons. Did you see any weapons? No, but I could tell there was more inside. Did he eventually come out? Yes. He wasn't as calm as the other two. Did he make an aggressive action toward you? He--he was, like, looking around, like, you know, he wanted to do something. So you were in fear of this unarmed man because he was looking around. And the first two men, were they on the ground? At some point, yeah. Did the third one get on the ground? He would-- he would get down, and then he would get back up and, you know, look around and stuff like that. What happened next? Well, he was gonna get up at one point there, and Jason pushed him down easy with his foot there on his shoulder. When he pushed the guy down on the ground with his foot, what happened next? This guy--everybody was trying to get him to put his hands behind his back, and he wouldn't do it. So I walked up to him, and I tapped him on the hand to try to make him understand that you need to put your hands behind your back. What happened after you hit him on the hand? I'd about done decided this guy wasn't going to put his hands behind his back, so I started back towards my truck to get some rope. What happened next? And you said everybody was in shock, right? Yes. Did Jason appear to be in shock? Yes. Is there any question in your mind that this shooting might have been intentional? No, sir. It was not intentional. I can tell you that. And you've known Jason for how long? I've known him about nine years. Is he a hothead? No. - Does he get angry? - No. Have you ever seen him raise his voice? Never. Ever heard him use a curse word? - Not ever. - Ever been in trouble? - Not ever. - Is he a vigilante type that wants to go out and get revenge on somebody - for taking his property? - No. When he asked you, "what do I do now?" You said, "Jason, just tell the truth." "Just tell the truth." Has he always told the truth about how this happened? Yes. And has he always said the same thing? Yes. It's always been what you described? Always the truth. Thank you, Mr. Flourney. Larry, I want to go see Jason tonight. All righty. This could be his last night. Could be. What if they finish up tomorrow and the verdict comes in and it's his last night at home? Mm-hmm. Well, they won't let US talk to him in court. Am I supposed to give up his last night, too? I know. I can't take his last night, can I? If this is his last night of freedom... He needs to spend it with Stephanie and jj, doesn't he? Hmm. And I have to give him that, don't I? Hmm. Thank you. You're right. Thank you for talking me out of that. Yep. You always know what to say. Mr. Kane says the most dangerous thing I can do is to take the stand. That's what he says. Yeah, but then he says I have to take the stand if I'm gonna have even a chance of acquittal. Yes, Jason. So which one am I supposed to do? Don't you believe god knows whether you should take the stand or not? I do. Think he'll let me know? I'm still in jail. I'm trapped. Steph, I'm just lost. My daddy says just because you don't know where you are, doesn't mean you're lost. Honey, I have no idea what you mean by that. I don't either. Jason, when you mentioned the bad points about using deer cameras to deputy book, what did he say? Well, he said, "why don't you just hire "a group of teenage guys to come out here and, when they come to steal the copper, just beat 'em up?" So, Jason, armed with your gun for protection and your cellphone for communication and a flashlight, you seated yourself on a plastic bucket in the woods and started to watch around 10:30 Friday night. Yes, sir. How do you know it was around that time? Well, I called my mom as soon as I got out there, and that was 10:24. And how do you know it was exactly 10:24? From my cellphone records. Now, did you have any other incoming or outgoing calls? A few. I called Stephanie a couple times and Billy, but mostly I just waited. What was it like out there, Jason? It was very dark, very quiet till I saw a car coming off in the distance sometime after midnight. Okay. Tell US about that. It came from Gideon road, passed on old betts road, and disappeared. It'd come back, passed me a second time. Then I saw it start back toward me again. I was shaking. I was just hoping it'd keep on going, but this time, it pulled over to the side of the road and cut the lights and engine. It just sat there. Then it crunk back up, and the lights come back on, and then it went real slow past the drive, and it turned around in the road and pulled right into the gravel drive, and when it did, the light shone right on me. I just--i just dove into the woods. When I dove into those bushes, I was scared, just scared to death. Crockett county 911 operator 712. What is your emergency? Yes. Gideon road and old betts road in ridgetop. Sir? Gideon road and old betts road in ridgetop. What is your address? It's a new house. I'm hiding in the woods. I'm being robbed. Stay on the line, sir. I'm transferring you. Sheriff's office. I have a caller for you. He says he's at Gideon road and old betts road in ridgetop. He's hiding in the woods, and he's being robbed. Sir, what's your address? It's a brand-new house. I don't have that address. I can't talk. And it's being robbed? What's your name? I can't talk. Oh, okay. Okay. How are we going to find you? I gotta hang up. Don't call me back. Okay. Okay. You can hang up now. Hello. Billy, it's Jason. They're here. Hello? Jason. Jason. - Jason? - Billy, they're here. They're out here right now. I'm being robbed. Did you call the law? Billy, I can't talk. Listen. I'm hiding in the woods. I don't know if they can see me. I called 911. You want me to come on out there? Lot three. Police said they'd have somebody patrolling the area all night. He should be here any second now. You come when you can. I'm gonna hang up now. Don't call back. Where's the police? Where are they? No. Lord, please no. Billy. Billy, please stay back. All right, now, y'all come on out. Police are on their way, and I got a gun! Y'all need to step out of there right now! Come on. Get out. Come on out now! Put your hands up now. - Put your hands up now. - Come on! Put your hands up now! - Come on. Over by... - Ven. Ven. Ven. Come on. Over there. Y'all lay down on the ground now. There's more in there. Put your hands behind your back. - Behind your back. - I can hear you in there. - Come on out now. - Down on the ground. Come on. Down. Behind your back. Come on. Hey, ¿que es esto? No, no, no, no, no, no, no! No, no, no, no! Over here! Over here, buddy! - ¿Pero que es esto? - Get down! ¿Quienes son este gente? - Tranquilo. - No, no, no, no. No me toque! Tranquilo. - No me toque! - Billy, get back. No me toque! No me toque! Lay down on the ground. - No trouble. - ¿que es esto? ¿Que es esto? Get down! Get down! All right? No, no, no. Down! Stay down! Oh, god! No! Why?! Oh, my god! I didn't mean to do that. Jason, just tell the truth. Mi primo! No! - Just tell the truth, Jason. - Call 911! Señor, por favor! - Please! We don't have anything... - Right. Crockett county 911, operator 4348. - What is your emergency? - Señor! - Por favor! - Send an ambu-- send an ambulance to the corner of Gideon road and old betts road in ridgetop. Someone's been shot. Everything was kind of-- I was-- they told me apply some pressure to the wound, so that's what I was trying to do. Okay. Did the ambulance come? No, sir. What did you do, Jason? Well, Billy said, "we need to get this man to the hospital," and I said, "you're right," so we picked him up and put him in Billy's truck. How did you pick him up? One arm was around Billy, and one arm was around me. We just walked him over there. - You didn't drag him, or-- - no, sir. No. We picked him up and carried him the whole way. Weren't you concerned about getting his blood on you? I wanted Mr. Reymundo to live. I'm sorry? I wasn't worried about blood. I just wanted him to live. Isn't it true that the single thing on your mind was that if anybody tried to Rob any of your houses, they weren't gonna get away with it? Isn't that true? No, ma'am. That's not true. All I wanted was for the police to catch whoever was doing this. You ignored deputy book's advice when he told you, if you saw anybody out there, to call 911. No, ma'am. I called 911 just like deputy book said, but he didn't have any officers in the area like he told me he would. I never would have come out had my father-in-law not drove up. He told you not to confront these people, didn't he? No, ma'am. He did not. Deputy book told me the only way I was gonna catch 'em was to catch 'em myself. So when he testified that he told you that if you saw anybody out there, you were to call 911 and not to confront them, he wasn't telling the truth? Yes, ma'am. That's correct. So you're saying he lied? Yes, he lied. But the truth of the matter is you went out there to catch somebody. Ma'am, that's not true. I went out to watch and to wait and to call the police, and that's exactly what I did. No intention of approaching them, confronting them, making a citizen's arrest, or shooting them? - No, ma'am. - Then why, Mr. Veitch, did you bring this? I didn't know what would happen if I was discovered. I just wanted to be prepared and protect myself. You testified that you came out of the woods because you feared for your father-in-law's safety. - Isn't that true? - Yes, ma'am. That's correct. He was safe enough at home in his bed, wasn't he? - Yes, ma'am. - And you're the reason that he was out there, Mr. Veitch, isn't that true? - Yes, ma'am. - You put him in harm's way. You are the one who caused this danger. Ms. Pitt, I wasn't the only one there. Mr. Veitch, you understand that you are here because the grand jury of this county has indicted you on five counts? I understand that. And you understand that you are charged with unlawfully killing a young man? I understand the charges. What was his name? Mr. Reymundo. What was his full name? Juan Carlos reymundo. So you admit that you killed him? No. I don't admit I killed a man. I accidentally shot a man. You killed him, didn't you? I didn't mean to kill Mr. Reymundo. Answer the question! You killed him, didn't you?! - He's dead because of me. - And he is dead because you shot him with a shotgun. I accidentally killed him with that gun, yes, ma'am. Nobody else put this shotgun on his back, did they? No, ma'am, they did not. And you pulled the trigger, didn't you? Mr. Reymundo was getting up. I thought he was gonna pull a gun or a knife. I was scared to death. But I know this for sure, Ms. Pitt. I didn't pick that gun up and aim it at Mr. Reymundo, put it on my shoulder, and pull that trigger. No, ma'am. I didn't do that. The shot that killed him was after you kicked him, wasn't it? I didn't kick Mr. Reymundo. I used my foot to push him back down. You pushed him to the ground with your foot? Yes, ma'am. That's correct. Why did you omit that from your direct testimony? What direct testimony, Ms. Pitt? The direct testimony we just had a few minutes ago. You didn't say a word about that. But Mr. Kane didn't ask me about that. So you lied to this court, didn't you, Mr. Veitch? When? No. I-- which is it, Mr. Veitch? Did you push him to the ground, or did you lie to this court? I--i don't-- when you killed Mr. Reymundo-- your honor, I object to the form of the question. He's already answered the business of killed. - His hands were in plain view. - I asked her to rephrase it, and the court instructed her to do so. Sustained. Mrs. Pitt, I want to clarify that the gun did accidentally go off. You did not give all the details to the police officer at the scene of the shooting. We didn't go into all the specific details at the time. I just answered the questions that he asked me. You told him what you wanted him to know, didn't you? I told him that I accidentally shot a man. That was the most important thing to me, was that I accidentally shot a man. Because that's what you wanted him to hear. Because that's the truth. Honey, what you looking at? It's that juror, the one I told you about. Larry, he scares me. An innocent young man is dead. Juan Carlos reymundo is dead, and the defendant killed him. No question, he killed him. We are here to determine if that's okay with you, if that's okay with you, the designated spokespersons for Crockett county. We are here to determine the guilt or innocence of Jason veitch, and you have heard his testimony, the defendant who had an excuse for everything, takes responsibility for nothing. You've heard the facts. You know the defendant was angry. As much as he tried to minimize that, you know he was angry. He lost a lot of money. He chose to go out there. He chose to go out there with a loaded gun. And despite the fact that the law is on the way and these guys aren't going anywhere, he cannot restrain himself from taking justice into his own hands. He became the aggressor. He fired a shot to scare the people, to intimidate them, forcing them to lie on the ground, gun pointed at them the whole time. What he did to these three men was aggravated assault, and what he did to Mr. Reymundo is felony murder. Ladies and gentlemen, you cannot create a situation by your own conduct and then claim, "oh, because of this situation, I was forced to do something bad to someone." You cannot put the forces in motion that create the danger and then claim the danger as your defense. Juan Carlos reymundo is dead, and Jason veitch killed him. And I ask you, I implore you, to not lose sight of that reality as you deliberate. On a dark Georgia night in February, 2008, two lives were accidentally destroyed. You cannot return Juan Carlos reymundo to his family. You cannot return Jason veitch to the life he knew before this tragic accident. But you can send Jason home. Jason went out to his property on the night of February 29 to help the police catch whoever was stealing from his property. He had done everything else he could do. Heh. He put up a sign that said, "smile. You're on camera." He put a vehicle on the site hoping that the burglars would think it was occupied. He filed a report every single time his houses got hit, and they got hit 17 times. 17 times. He had done everything that he could do, and a young sheriff's deputy with a long history of poor conduct and unprofessional behavior flippantly gave him bad advice. Jason went out there to his property not because he was a vigilante or a Rambo, as the state wants you to believe, but he--he was just simply protecting his property... And he reacted to a situation that transpired because he was simply scared to death. There's a law in this state called the stand your ground law. It used to be that even if you were in your home and somebody just broke in there with a gun, you had the duty to retreat. No more. The Georgia legislature has said you don't have to retreat. You can stand your ground, and that's what Jason did. He stood his ground. Now, it seems to me that the law was never designed to give you protection on the one hand and rip it out with the other. The law was not designed to allow you to defend yourself, but if you do, it's a crime. Now, the prosecutor, she wants you to believe that these acts were done by an enraged man who just wanted to shoot somebody. I want you to see Jason veitch for who he is. He is a good man... Who was put in an impossible situation and did the best he could. He's a good man. And though he never intended to do harm, he knows somebody died as a result of what he did. He knows that every time he looks at the mirror. He knows that every time he looks at his seven-year-old son. He will never get over that. The state has an opportunity to close closing arguments. Does the state wish to proceed? Please, your honor. You may do so. A young man is dead, and it was all so unnecessary. Juan Carlos reymundo can no longer speak for himself. He can no longer ask for justice for himself or his grieving family... So I ask for him. Right here, right now, let's show the world what Georgia justice means. You are duty-bound to apply the law here. It's more than that. You have a sworn obligation to Juan Carlos, an oath that you made to god. God, I pray for bojangles and my teacher, and I pray that I don't have to go to school tomorrow. Amen. Jj, honey, why don't you want to go to school tomorrow? Will daddy pick me up after school? Probably. Maybe. We might be getting some big news for daddy tomorrow. Tomorrow is a big day. Mommy, me and daddy need to talk. What you want to talk about, big man? They're gonna tell you about jail tomorrow. Yeah. We think tomorrow will be the day we find out. Are you scared? Mm-hmm. Are you? Yeah, but just a little bit. I talked to Jesus about it. He told me that he goes to jail, too, so you won't be alone. There's something I'm supposed to do, just in case. What's that? You eat any lunch? I got a breakfast bar in here somewhere. One way or another, we're gonna find out today. Will you eat it if I find it? Kane says there's no way those 12 jurors could agree on all those charges. Why don't we walk around? He doesn't think Jason's coming home with US today. Come on, cuz. Let's go see if the sky has cleared up any. Jackie, don't. There are 12 people back there deciding what is gonna happen to my son. What can I do? I am going to pray for him and for them and for US right here. Debbie, you can join me, or you can leave. Dear lord, help US now. Whatever is being decided in that room, take care of my son. Take care of my little bird. Give him protection under your wings. "For he will give his angels charge over thee to protect thee in all thy ways." Thank you, lord, for your protection in the dark night and for the joy that comes in the morning. Thank you, father, for helping our brother, for helping my brother. It's time. Ladies and gentlemen, let me remind you that this is a matter that requires utmost dignity. As I said before, a young man has perished, and another's life is in the balance. There will be no cause for outward disagreement or celebration no matter what this verdict is. Has the jury reached a verdict? Oh, lord, not him. We have, your honor. Please hand the verdict form to the bailiff. Will the defendant please rise? "The state of Georgia vs. Richard Jason veitch. We the jury find the defendant..." "Not guilty of felony murder." "1b, we the jury find the defendant "not guilty of involuntary manslaughter "as a result of pointing a gun. "C, we the jury find the defendant "not guilty of involuntary manslaughter "as a result of reckless conduct. "D, we the jury find the defendant "not guilty as a result of simple battery. "E, we the jury find the defendant "not guilty of involuntary manslaughter during the commission of a lawful act." So says the jury. Ladies and gentlemen, it's been a long journey. Let's go home. Not a day goes by that I don't think about her and her family. Not a day goes by that I don't pray for them, And I have learned to listen... And I take him at his word. * I could not have known * * how it all would end * how they would accuse * and how you would defend * father, through it all * you told me to believe * wrongs would be made right * the captive would go free * so I trusted you * like a child would do * I took you at your word * every word you've said * every promise made * and every verse I read * the truth would soon prevail * justice would be served * and love would never fail * I took you at your word * when you said, "take up your cross * * walk into this war" * my heart began to waver * and I cried out to you, lord * * my refuge and my fortress * my deliverer, my friend * your child is needing rescue * * come and prove yourself again * * and I trusted you * like a child would do * I took you at your word * every word you've said * every promise made * and every verse I read * truth would soon prevail * justice would be served * love would never fail * I took you at your word * you will know the truth * * and the truth'll set you free * * it will set you free * you will know the truth * * and the truth'll set you free * * and who the son has freed is free indeed * * I took you at your word * every word you've said * every promise made * and every verse I read * the truth would soon prevail * * justice would be served * and love would never fail * * I took you at your word * I took you at your word * * your word * every word you said * * I took you at your word * every promise made * and every verse I read * took you at your word * took you at your word * - * ohh - * every word you said - * took you at your word - * every promise made
