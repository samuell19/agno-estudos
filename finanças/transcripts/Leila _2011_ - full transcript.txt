The bitterly cold weather seemed to have gone on for an eternity. It was months since they had opened their presents beneath the decorated... (suspenseful music) - [Leila] Are you OK? - Yeah it's OK, I just broke a cup. - Oh. - [Leila] Hello? Hello? - What do you know? - About Andy. - What about Andy? - That you've slept with him. - And why do you say that? - Because I have seen your text messages and they're explicit. - What did you read? - Are you telling me you haven't had sex with him? - Yes. - You are lying to me. - No. - Leila, stop messing with my head. I don't care what you call it. - Now there is nothing going on between me and Andy. OK? Paul Paul Paul. Shhh. You are so tired, and you've been working so hard. Why don't you go to bed and get some rest, eh? - Hi, Daddy! - Shhhhh. - Hi, Mum. - Where's Daddy going? - Daddy is going up to bed, he's not feeling very well.

What is it? What's the matter? - Look. - Is that it? - What do you mean is that it, the camera's gone. - Well it must be here somewhere, I was looking at it five minutes ago. - [Leila] Well where is it? - I don't know, it was just there, I remember zipping up the case. Did you have it Harry? - No, don't blame the children. - It's bound to be somewhere. - Well where, because unless we find it we are not going away for the weekend. - [Children] No! - All right, all right, it's OK. Mummy doesn't mean it. - Yes she does. - Please God, let us go on holiday for the weekend. Please God, let us find our camera. Please God, let us find our camera. - Amy, please stop. - Dad, have you looked? - Where? - You know where. - No, I haven't put it there. - Is it there? - No. - No? It isn't there. - I hate you. - Harry, Harry, we'll find the camera. It's got to be in the house somewhere. - Have you looked in the usual place? - No, it is not there. It must be down here somewhere. - I can't believe you'd do this. - Shut up. - I'm going. - Where? - To my mum's. I'm gonna take the car. I've left the bags in the hall. And I don't care what you do. - You can't go. The children are really looking forward to this weekend. - Hey, Amy, enough sweetheart. It's all right, it's all right. Come on, big brave girl, eh? Hey?

Amy, why did you write this? - Because it's the truth. - Yes, but we don't want other people knowing our business do we. - I got three stars for it. - I don't care if you got three stupid stars for it. And don't tell Daddy about it, either. Come here, Amy. Amy sweetheart, come here. I'm sorry. Oh, such a heavy girl. I'm sorry.

I'll be back soon. - Lots of preparation. (door closing) (door closing) (telephone ringing) - Hello. Hi Dad. You all right? Really? Is she OK? All right, no no, it's fine. Look, if you just bring them over later on, I can put them straight to bed. - What was that? - It'll be one of the kids. - I thought they were with their grandmother. - No no, you go through, I'll go and check. - Who's going to take all this stuff to the meeting, you or me? - I can, but it's only next door to the office. - No it's not. - Yeah, Churchill Conference rooms. - Livingston House, streets away. - Are you sure? - Who's got the better track record for meetings? - Now that is unfair. OK. (keyboard clicking) There you go. - That is so strange. - What do you mean? - Well, it's definitely Livingston house, because I booked it. How did that happen?
