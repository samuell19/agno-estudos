Stryker, 0305977. 412. The president loves you, colonel stryker... As, of course, we all do. Of course. It has to be done. The congress has spoken. Congress has a tendency to speak, especially in an election year. That's not really a very profound remark, you know. But then, luckily, you're not paid to think. It's only 10,000 gallons. Agh. Dump it. Pack it up, move it, dump it. Pull in that crew-- that nerveless bunch of boobs you worked with before--and move it. How? Covertly, that's how, and don't fly it. Do you know what 412 is? Thank you very much. I don't want to know what 412 is. Very wise of you. I pray you'll never learn. I prefer my present assignment. But he loves you. Oh, no, he doesn't. He needs me. That's a different thing, Billy. Is it? Are you certain? Yes. Well, I'm not. As I grow older, I'm not really certain about anything anymore. That's why you're the perfect man for your job, Billy. I know. That's probably why I'm in charge here. I haven't the faintest idea what I'm doing. You're lying. I often lie. There's no need to lie. Isn't there? Ha ha ha! Welcome back, sergeant. I'm glad it's you. Did you have to ask for me, colonel? You know, the percentages are getting mighty low. Come on, Jim. We wouldn't do that to you. Not much. What am I carrying this time? This load's as wholesome and safe as apple pie. What do you think you're doing, redman, you ass? I'm point man, colonel. You assigned me. Where's the neon sign saying "what's with the funny truck behind me"? Or is the outfit notice enough? This is covert, redman. Covert! Oops. Covert? Covert. Jim, the president loves you, sergeant redman loves you, and I love you. And I'll buy you a beer in San Diego in exactly 74 hours. I was in Diego during the war. They had 3 Ferris wheels on the main street. What a town. Swell. Are you ready? You ready, colonel? Do it. Done. Now what, sir? We hold our breath. Bad load, sir? Well, corporal, it ain't apple pie. [Truck horn honks] You know, I don't think California quail are nafigous. It's not pronounced that way, Emma. It's nidifugous. Well, how would you know that? Nobody knows how to pronounce that. That's why they use words like that. Ah! Mountain chickadee, two o'clock. Where? Where? Where? I don't see it. Well, it's gone now. [Vehicle engine] What's that noise? It's a truck. What truck would use the old road? Well, one is today. Well, it'll frighten the birds. The birds? Emma, the general belief is, the birds moved out the day you moved in. There it is. It's an awful big truck. I wonder what it's doing here. You are the only birder I know that smokes. Why do you do that? It's disgusting! Who put you in charge? I drink, too. [Tires skidding] Man: Hey, Phil! Stop! Stop! Get away from there! Phil, come back! Phil, come back! No! That Andy capp! Gloria, what do you say I take you out for breakfast? That's the best piece of toast I ever had. Want some butter for it? Right under your foot. It'll sink, Abel. It's going to sink. You put cement in water, Abel, it sinks. That's nature's way. If you'd gone to high school, you'd know that. Come on, get out. We're having a picnic. Now. Out. You. Now. People are doing this all the time. I've got plans right inside, pictures and everything. It'll be finished in a week, if everybody will leave me alone. We'll have a little sail. Abel, there's no mast, no rudder, no sail, no anchor, no ropes. We'll have a little float? And no life preservers. I went to high school, and besides, the water's only 4 feet deep there. Your hull is at least 5. It won't even fit. We'll wait for high tide. Talking to you is like talking to a wall-- a Welsh wall. And it's not cement. It's concrete. Fat lot you know. What have you got in here? Your favorite-- vanilla pudding on whole wheat. Mmm. With Mayo? I'll just go in the house and clean up a little bit. Woman: You know, that old joke really applies to you. What old joke? You can tell a rich boy from Georgia because he's got twocars jacked up in his front yard. Don't make fun of my cars. You can make fun of my boat, but don't make fun of my cars. And don't make fun of Georgia. [Siren] Bad accident! Abel: Where? At Franklin crossing by the old bird sanctuary, the old road. A semi. When? Sometime this morning. People hurt? People dead? One ok, two dead. Maybe more later. A semi, you say? Yeah, a big semi. How big a crew? 3, I guess. What did it hit? Nothing. Apparently it just blew up. It didn't hit anything. Wait a minute. You said there were a crew of 3, you accounted for 3, it didn't hit anything, and you say more may die? Who? US. It's 412. That's what they call it. That's what they call what? 412. Ok. What's 412? I don't know. That's what colonel stryker called it. He's coming. Ask him. Whatever it is, that's what spilled out. I do know it's something that doesn't break down, doesn't go away, unless, of course, a wind comes up, and blows it somewhere else. Oh, boy. What are we supposed to do, sergeant? How do we clean it up? You can't. You don't have the equipment. The army will clean it up. Colonel stryker said to close the area off and pray. It's some poison something, isn't it? Poison gas of some kind. It's a weapon-- some kind of weapon that kills and doesn't go away, some awful substance rolling around out at Franklin crossing because the u.S. Army, in its infinite wisdom, decided to transport on rotten old back roads. And it's just lying there, waiting for a wind to come up and kill US all. Oh, good. Abel, how are we supposed to evacuate 2,000 backpackers and hikers and campers when we don't even know where they're at? We can't, Malcolm. It would take forever. Anyway, the army's sending in some rig from Los Angeles-- the container, they call it. It's supposed to suck the stuff up somehow. Should be here in a couple of hours. We may get by unless a wind comes up. Did you find out what that stuff is? No, but it isn't too pleasant. It apparently kills things. Plants? Plants? Yeah, plants. Trees. You know. Will it hurt growing things? Will it hurt the land? There's land out there. What's going to happen to the land? Gee, I don't know, Malcolm. All we can do is wait and keep people away and not breathe too deep. What's the matter? Well, that's Amy's land. She owns all that land out there. Amy? Amy. Amy Franklin. My girlfriend Amy. Oh. Oh, right. Yeah. Amy. I didn't know you two were serious. Well, I'm serious. Good. She's neat. Yeah. I'd be really lucky if it worked out. Malcolm, you're one of the nicest, gentlest people I know. She'd be lucky. Uh, well, you see, we decided... Well, you see, we discussed about what she was going to do with it, and we thought maybe she'd sell it. That's why I asked. Be a real shame if the land was ruined. Yeah. Norton air force base? This is major slate. Give me the weather tower, please. Yeah. Weather tower? Major slate. What's the plot? Major slate? It's an old trick. See, they won't give out-- yeah. Yeah. Got you. Thanks. I don't know why I bother. I don't know what they're talking about. Do you really know what a low-pressure area is, really? How serious is it, Abel? It's deadly serious. We may sneak by. Two men are dead who were alive, but the stuff-- 412, they call it-- seems to stay where it's spilled, and there's no wind and none predicted. Well, you have your hands full. Here's your free lunch. Uh, I'll trade you lunch for dinner. Deal. The pit? The pit? The pit? That isn't food they serve there, you know. I don't know what it is, but it isn't food. That's how I get half my patients. 6:00? 6:00. The pit. [Buzzing] Abel marsh. Abel, is that you? Fred, who do you think it is-- Marshall McLuhan? Who? Who is it? Fred-- we found a car here, Abel, parked near the field. One of those little Japanese jobs. I don't know. They all look alike to me. And Doris, that newspaper lady who's coming out-- word's leaking, Abel. Everything is leaking. Ok, ok. I'm coming. [Car backfires] Abel! [Helicopter] That's the army. You seen the chief? Just left. Huh? He just left. That way. Oh. Ok. Down. Is that the brass? Colonel stryker? Yeah, that's him walking in. Big fancy scientific-type gas mask, some geiger-counter kind of thing, and off he went. He's brought a second mask, if you'd like to join him. Just breathe normally, and if there's a leak, that goes off. Abel: Then what? You get back up here fast if you can still walk-- if you're still alive. Ok, let's try it. Yeah. [Muffled] How do I talk? Chief, if you want to talk, push that button right there, see? Right there. There. That's right. But it's safer if you don't talk. [Muffled] No, no. Push the button right there. That's right. Now say what you want to say. What do you want to say? Good-bye. Why did he do that? That's his job. He's the chief of police. What's his job? I have no idea. Sabotage? And/or murder. Redman, 4 body bags. Plastic gloves. Right. Sergeant? Polly Campbell and Emma Henderson. Two of our people-- spinsters, and neat ladies. So now 4 are dead in Jasper lake. Wind's up. We're losing an acre a minute. Move it. We're moving, colonel. We're going to get the stuff. At least there are no more people threatened. People? It's the land. You can't suck 412 out of the land. That's why congress sent US to sea to dump it. 412 does to the land what it did to those people, and just as permanent. I don't know, Malcolm. That's chemistry, not medicine, but I suspect that they'll never tell you what 412 is-- only what it does. We can see what it does. Oh, well. You know, it's only land. It's not people. Malcolm: Only land? It's our-- it's your future. Is it family land, Amy? She earned it. ♪ Won't you come home, bill Bailey? ♪ ♪ Want you to come home ♪ I moan the whole night long ♪ ♪ I'll do the cooking, honey ♪ ♪ I'll pay the rent ♪ I know I done you wrong ♪ ♪ remember that rainy evening ♪ ♪ I put you out... Why don't we go in there? What? Why don't we go in there? Ok. Singers: ♪ bill Bailey, won't you please come on home? ♪ What did that mean, you earned it? Oh. What Malcolm is talking about is that I'm divorced and it was my husband's land. It was part of my-- actually, all of my divorce settlement. Um, this is California, you know. Half of his is mine; Half of mine is his. Well, he spent his half of mine, and then he spent my half of mine, and so, yes, I took his land because that's all there was left after 4 swell years of marriage to handsome David Franklin-- a proud lineage that runs back deep into this country's history-- at least all of 11 minutes. Where's the colonel? I thought he was with you. No. I went home and changed, and he was at the station making some calls. Then he was going to his motel and change. Gloria thinks he's pretty. I'm here. Is he pretty? A woman without a man is like a fish without a bicycle. What's going on? Nothing. Hi, Abel. Amy: But thank you for inviting US to dinner. It's a pity the food is inedible. It's the best place in town. Lord knows that's true. Hi, folks. My name is Phyllis. Can I get you something? Yes, please. Beer. Phyllis: Beer. Beer. Banana daiquiri. Oh, colonel. Colonel stryker, this is Susan Glasgow. Colonel Edward stryker. And Amy Franklin of Franklin cross. Stryker: Oh, boy. Scotch, rocks. Double, please. Abel: Of course, you know Malcolm. Ok. We've cleaned up the surface spill. It's gone. By tonight or tomorrow morning, everything will be gone, save for the contaminated area west of the road, which is, I understand, miss Franklin, your land. Now, miss Franklin, Abe here tells me you're thinking of putting your land on the market. Susan: It's Abel. They call him Abel. Oh. Oh, I'm sorry, Susan. Doc. They call her doc. Doc. Uh, well. Was that true? You bet it's true. Have you set a price? Have you? Ha ha ha. Abel: Colonel, h-how much land was destroyed? Stryker: It went back in a sort of wedge shape. I'd say about 300 acres, give or take-- a few deaths. Miss Franklin, today's spill wasn't preplanned. Stryker: You do understand. It's not government policy. Great. That's great. Listen, what exactly is 412? I mean, you have to tell US that much. I can't tell you what 412 is-- here's to truth in advertising. I can't tell you what 412 is because I don't know. I know what it does but not what it is. I don't know how it does what it does, but what it does do is, it vanquishes oxygen. Oh, lord. What? What do you mean? 412 is one of a group called defeaters. It defeats oxygen. It eliminates it. With no oxygen, there's no life. Animal or plant. That'll be $1,000 an acre, soldier boy. Stryker: What's that? That's Abel's truck. Yeah, but... What is it? That's a 1928, '29, '30, and '31 model a Ford-- uh, with 1935 wheels. He's fixing it up. Interesting. We'll walk you to your Jeep. Thank you. What do you know about that girl-- Amy Franklin? She's a friend of Malcolm's, and Malcolm's a friend of mine. She got that land in a divorce settlement and came back to look it over and decide what to do with it. Apparently. Now, wait a minute. You think Amy Franklin had anything to do with blowing up that truck, that's lunacy. She wants $400,000 for her land. I don't blame her, and neither do you. Who knew that truck was coming through here? Me, 5 others. Who knew what the load was? Me, 5 others. We're being checked. I started the check, and it'll be some check. I can imagine. It isn't anybody under my command. I picked them. I picked the route. I picked the departure time, as I have in the past. You mean you've sent other trucks through here carrying stuff like 412? Yes, indeed. Not 412, but other things, occasionally. It's one of my jobs. One of your jobs? What do you do? I...i work for the government. I bet you do. Man: Hello, Abel! Spent the night alone again, huh? Ha ha ha! What is this? A vat? That's not a vat, Carter. That's a boat. What's the matter with you? What do you mean, a boat? You're kidding. That's not a boat. That's a vat. Fill it up with stuff, like manure, maybe. You've seen them on the highway. You ought to have it taken away. It doesn't help the look of your place any. That's a boat, Carter. It's a concrete boat, and I'm going to put it in the lake down there. Yeah. I know, Abel. A boat, huh? How are you going to get it down there? We're going to slide it down. Oh. We're going to take some boards, and we're going to grease them, and we're going to slide it down, and we're going to elevate the boards, and that's how we're going to put it in. Yeah? Well-- and this is private property. You're trespassing, Carter. Yeah? Well, good luck with the vat. Ha ha ha! I want to talk to you, Abel. What is going on? That's talking, Doris? Can't you say "good morning"? Good morning. What is going on? It's only 8:00 Monday morning. Hopefully, nothing. I mean about that truck and all those men and their gas masks, the soldiers. You can't suppress the truth, Abel marsh. I'm going to find out, and my readers are going to find out. Good. When you find out, you let me know. Wait a minute. You're supposed to help me. How can I help you? You're the reporter. You have to do the digging. I can't do that for you, and you wouldn't want me to. You have pride in your work. You're a professional, Doris. Now, you dig that story out. That's what you're paid to do, and you wouldn't have it any other way. And then, if you're willing to share your findings with US, we will of course be very grateful. We can use all the help we can get. Thank you, Doris, for your interest. Good morning, Abel. Stryker says that dynamite was implanted about midnight. That's 7 hours before that truck blew up. Morning, Fred. How does he know that? How should I know? We got a bet. John says he comes from the east. I say he's come from Alabama and he had speech lessons. You're both wrong. He was born in Ireland. Did Malcolm have the duty Saturday night? John: Yes, 4:00 to 12:00. I was 8:00 to 4:00. You got his report? He hasn't turned it in yet. He usually sees Amy after his tour, doesn't he? Yeah, usually. Anybody know if he saw her that night after his tour? John: Yeah, usually. Oh, beauty. I'm legal. So was world war ii, Jake. Morning, Amy. How you doing? That crud work here? Jake's all right. He's had some hard times. So did his wife-- around the head and face and chest. He's a beater, Amy, a wife-beater. A woman beater. I know. He told me. I can handle him. You have any news? Yeah, some. Stryker's calling management-- the Pentagon-- to discuss the possibility of buying your land. In the interim, he's going to put a big, fancy fence up to keep people out. It's not his land, Abel. And he's got some guy coming to see about the feasibility of clearing the contaminated soil away-- you know, like strip-mining-- then reseeding it. Abel, it's not his land. Amy... Did you have a date with Malcolm Saturday night after his tour? Why? Because i'm the chief of police and I'm asking you. Is he in trouble? Amy. Yeah, we met. Around 10:00 or so? No, midnight. He got off at midnight. We drove around for a while. And before midnight? Who? You. I had a date. You had a date? Yes, I had a date. What do you think, I blew up your truck, me and Jake? Jake? I was out with Jake. Jake? Yes, Jake. You went out with Jake--that Jake? Not exactly out. He, uh, he was at my place. Your place. Yes. My place. My room. I live at Mrs. Beezly's-- you know, the boarding house? Jake was in your room at Mrs. Beezly's boarding house? Mrs. Beezly knew we were there. She saw US come in. She saw US leave. Well, me leave. I met Jake at the strawberry field at 8:00. We were back at my place around 9:00, I guess. And I left to meet Malcolm. And all we did was drive around, like I said, for a while. Hey, Abel? You don't have to tell Malcolm, do you? Tell him what, Amy? Woman: Jake went to school with our Phil. He was at his wedding, and he was a pig. He still is a pig. Abel, I don't know about that girl. I know she sees your Malcolm. She never brings him over here. He ain't ugly enough for her. Not that Malcolm's the prettiest thing in town, but he's a nice man. She's--she's had other men, then? And Saturday night, it was Jake? You saw them? Well, pin it down for me, frieda. Can you? Well, he came in sometime during supper, about 8:30, and then she left at 11:30. And he stayed? Frieda, for goodness sakes, this is your place. You don't have to have overnight guests. Abel, I rent these people my rooms, not my morals. It really isn't any of my business. So she likes ugly men. I don't. Frieda, are you flirting with me? You lose about 20 years, and you come back. I like younger men. What would we talk about? Talk? I bathe when I want, I shave when I want, and I pay my own way. And what I do with my friends is my business-- who I see, what I do, and when I do it. And if you don't like it, go ahead and put the cuffs on me. You drink scotch whiskey in a glass. I drink beer from a can. Arrest me! You live in a house. I live in a trailer park. Book me. I go bowling. You play chess. Well, arraign me. I got a young girl who likes me. You don't. Lock me up. I spend the night out. You spend it in. Throw the keys away. I got something women like, chief. It ain't no funny truck. Jake, I must tell you, my manhood is not at stake here. Believe me. Neither is mine. You just go inside there and ask. 10-4, Bertha. Catch your act later. Bye-bye. You guys want anything else? I've got some fresh rhubarb pie. I've got bread pudding, raisin ice cream. The cheesecake is good. I just thawed it out. Uh, well, no, I don't... So, what does that prove? What? What does it prove? Does it prove anything? It proves Amy has an alibi. Is that what you want me to say? Yeah, though it's a revolting alibi. You want class in your alibis, move to Beverly Hills. What I don't understand is, why is Amy messing around with Malcolm if she likes guys like Jake? Maybe she just likes men, Abel. You know what I mean? I mean men. A lot of men. She's up to something, John, but I don't think it's that. United States of america is here. Um, he's ok. He's just in trouble, and he's struggling. Yeah? They found another body. It's Vernon brea, boss. Vernon was no bird-watcher. He was a farmer, and not a very good one. If he was in here, he was probably poaching. Did you find a gun? No. Found nothing. Is it safe to go in there? More or less. Abel: Oh, lord. Look what's happening. It's in the land. Uh-huh. It looks like it's just creeping. This is dead, that's dying, and it's just moving. As invincible as sin. Abel, get your nose out of that. If this were my land, I'd want $2,000 an acre. Do you think I don't know that? We're losing the land and the water and the air... Because we're sloppy... Or cruel or greedy and rapacious. Somebody came here and did this-- an ape--an ape with a trainer. And 4 people are dead because of that. No, sir. 4 people are dead because of 412. No, sir. 4 people are dead because somebody from Jasper lake set an explosive here on this road. It's the old chicken or the egg dilemma, huh, colonel? Which came first? For instance, you knew that 412 was coming across the country. Ok, one for you. But there's a flaw in your argument. I'd never heard of Jasper lake, luckily. Further, this is not my land. Abel, did that guy ever find you? I don't know, Jeff. What guy? The guy in overalls, looked like a farmer? Vernon. Was he about 5'10", 5'11", probably needed a shave, a lot of gray hair? Yeah, yeah. He found you? No. We found him. What happened, Jeff? Yesterday afternoon sometime, you drove away. He drove in. I told him you just left, and so he went away, but he seemed pretty anxious to talk to you. Thanks, Jeff. Well, Vernon might have seen something. Could have been hunting and then gone home. Right. Then went back again yesterday, maybe to confirm what he'd seen, not knowing about the 412. Hey, did he have a wife? Good idea, but no. Vernon was a widower. He had nobody. Come on in. Hello, everybody. Hi. Hello, whit. What are you doing here? How's Nellie? Oh, she's-- well, let's see. Oh, uh, Gloria, were you able to get the gold star ambulance? All set. Harry's going to deliver Vernon's body directly to the coroner on horse mountain. Fred: The stud. Hmm? Nothing. He's jealous because the coroner, known locally as a stud, and probably for good reason, went to school with doc. But Abel didn't go to school with doc. Abel went to school with my husband Fred. Gloria: He's the pretty one over there in the corner. Why don't you sit down? Abel, you want to swap? I'll take the stud, and you take Fred. Fred: Sit down. You got something? Sit down. I'm sitting. Are you ready? Yes! "Amy Franklin of Franklin crossing, "born Amy McGregor of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, 25 may, 1950." Fred-- "where her father, a captain in the United States army, was stationed." Shall I continue? Mm-hmm. Would you like to know what her father did in the army? Yes. He was a chemist. Chemist. "One trained in chemistry." Chemistry. "A science that deals with the composition of structures and properties of substances and of the transformations they undergo." David wardley Franklin, Amy's husband. Would you like to know what he does for a living? He's a civilian chemist employee of the government. His specialty: Biochemical warfare. How does that grab you? Oh, boy. Phone. May I use your phone, please? [Whispers] 18. Stryker, 0305977. His code. His code. Stryker: Mallory? Hi. Last name Franklin. F-r-a-n-k-l-i-n. First name David, uh-- wardley. W-a-r-d-l-e-y. Middle name wardley, w-a-r-d-l-e-y. Civilian in our employ. A chemist. Biochemist. I'll wait. Well, colonel, looks like we were both wrong. It's not which came first; It's who came first. Mallory? Go ahead. What are you talking about? We're trying to establish the responsibility for the deaths. Is it the person who invented 412 or the person who blew up the truck? Ok, Mallory. Thank you. Guess who aided in the development of 412. David Franklin, Amy's... You got it. And curiously enough, he lives and works in Los Angeles, a hundred miles away. What's up? Malcolm: Is something up? You're all sitting around like you lost your best friend. Um... Hey, uh... Hey, Malcolm, we've stumbled onto something. Why don't we go across to tiny's, and I'll fill you in? Ok, but I got to go on patrol. That's ok. You go ahead. I'll be there in a minute. See if he's thawed out his cheesecake, and I'll take a piece. Well, looks like I'm going to Los Angeles. Before I go, I'll take the boat, go over to Vernon's, and look around. Wear boots. What? Gloria: You're going to need boots to take the boat-- hip boots. Is the dock under water? What dock? The police dock. Talk to whit. What? Fred: That's right. Whit. Whit. Huh? What are you doing here? He's under arrest. Well, w-we don't have a dock, and I thought-- Fred: He stole our dock. He pulled the pipes up, put a rope around it, and towed it to his place, by hand. Walking. A-And I thought we could share it. Whit... There would be plenty of room for you. I mean, you can tie up there anytime that you want, you know. You just get your rope and throw it on your dock there, and I'll be right there to c-catch it for you, and we got no problem. Whit... Do you and Nellie have a boat? Well, uh, no. No, but we're thinking about getting one, though. Hey, you guys, what do you guys recommend? Do you--do you think a 25-horsepower would be enough? Or do you-- you know, uh, probably--maybe-- probably ought to get a 75-horsepower. That way we could, uh, get away from you guys all the time instead of getting c-caught. Whit. Huh? Bring it back. What? The dock. Bring the dock back. Bring-- bring it back? Mm-hmm. Well, uh... All right. But, uh... Could I borrow your boots? Well, there you have it. Thanks, tiny. Wow. What kind of man is this David Franklin? What's he trying to do? There are 5 dead people. What would make a man do a thing like that? Do you suppose he was trying to hurt Amy? That's a possibility, Malcolm. Divorced people sometimes have a kind of a hatred. Anyway, I'm going down to see Mr. Franklin. Do you think I should come? No. No, that would be a mistake, wouldn't it? Mmm. Maybe Franklin is jealous. Do you think he knows Amy has a boyfriend? Oh. Amy. I would hate to be the cause of anything-- Malcolm, did you know that Amy's father was a chemist in the army? Really? Wow. That's a coincidence. Yeah, isn't it? [Dog barks] [Horn honks] "1012." 412. 1012. [Tires screech] Anybody home? Mr. Franklin? David Franklin! Franklin! David Franklin! Well, it was David Franklin. And it looked like suicide. Or it was meant to look like suicide or was suicide. Or wasn't. If he did commit suicide, that must mean the case is closed. Which case? The accidental deaths of thetwo soldier drivers and two bird-watchers, the maybe accidental death of Vernon brea, the maybe death by suicide of David Franklin, the sabotage of federal property... The settlement of claims arising from said sabotage. I withdraw the question. What about the girl? Amy was at the trading post all day. The minute you called, I went out. There she was, having a beer with her friend Jake. Jake? [Door opens] You ready? Gloria: You got me a new fridge? What's the matter with what we got? Vernon brea, white male Caucasian. Gloria: Fred, white and Caucasian mean the same thing. He probably thinks it means Vernon came from the caucasus. What are the caucasus? Fred, have you got something? The coroner's report. Oh! From Dr. Cape? Peter? The stud? You call him the stud, too? No. Other people call him the stud, Abel. I wouldn't do that. He's a friend. Fred: Are you people through? Vernon brea died of a lack of oxygen. But not from our old friend 412. Vernon was suffocated. No trace of foreign substances in bloodstream, no 412, no accidental death, Abel. Murder one. I think that means the case has been reopened. I'm just in the way here. Thank you, Gloria. Bye, everybody. Abel: You can't leave. Why not? You don't have a car. How was your day? Anything happen in L.A.? See, it's--it's just been 4 months. I know. A lot of dad's patients were his own age, his generation. And there aren't too many of them left. The trouble is, a lot of men don't want a woman doctor. Well, yeah. Uh... I know it's a-- how do you say-- I guess they just don't feel easy with a lady doctor. I mean, if I didn't know you-- no, i-- I haven't been sick. But, I mean, I'd go. Would you? Oh, in a second. In a second. But you have--you have lots of women patients. Ha ha ha! Yeah. I have more women patients than I have men. But a lot of women don't want to go to a woman doctor. So consequently, I am working in a rather narrow little space. Which, of course, I knew going in. Going in, sure. But like we said-- 4 months and you'll make it. You're good. Yeah. I am. I'm a good diagnostician, like dad was. I love that. I love the chase, I guess. The solving things. Like what you do. The deductive process. I just love it. Want to come in? Yeah. Good. But I can't. Bye. I--i can't. You can't? Tonight, I can't. Oh. Another night, I could. Could what? Abel, whispering: Frieda. Thanks, frieda. I didn't want to talk on the phone, because I didn't want to take the chance of anybody hearing US. I have to know about Amy's night last night. Did she meet Malcolm as usual? No, Abel. She didn't. Uh-oh. She had a visitor. He came in sometime during supper, and he left this morning during breakfast. Lot of people saw him come in, lot of people saw him leave? Saw them both. They came in together, and they went out together. Conspicuously? Well, in his case, that was certainly the word. Meaning what? Meaning tiny. Tiny? Tiny? Tiny from tiny's? Did he stay all night? I don't suppose-- he stayed all night. How do you know? I heard them. Ohhh. Abel? Want a little home-grown? I beg your pardon? Do you smoke? Frieda, I don't smoke, and you don't smoke. Period. End of discussion. Frieda, i'm the chief of police. Ok. Then you want to fool around? Abel: Nonfat chocolate milk. Artificial chocolate. Artificial chocolate? Listen. We've got fake sugar, simulated eggs, phony bacon, imitation mayonnaise, phony butter, orange juice that ain't, coffee that doesn't have any coffee in it, and I've got a machine in the back room that turns hamburger into steak. You know, a person can come in here and order a whole meal and not get one thing they asked for. Pretty soon, they're going to have imitation cholesterol. Yeah. What do you want, Abel? Amy Franklin. That's easy. Take her. She's yours. No, I don't wanther. Oh, well, join the club. What does that mean, tiny? Call me Lloyd. Lloyd? Yeah, please call me Lloyd. That's my name. I hate to be called tiny. Call me Lloyd. Ok, Lloyd. Yeah. That's my name. Lloyd. Ok. We were talking about Amy Franklin. Oh, yeah. What do you want to know about her? Well, they say she likes men, tiny. Lloyd. All kinds, all sizes. Just men. That's what they say? Mm-hmm. They're lying to you. She doesn't like men. Don't you see? If she liked men, she wouldn't go out with me. Look at me, Abel. Oh, now, wait a minute. Wait a minute. So you had a night with her, for whatever reason. Don't analyze it. Just accept it. You had a night with her. Yeah. A night. Yeah. I think she wants to marry me. Well... Malcolm. Let me tell you what the evidence suggests. Now, this won't be easy on you, ok? Yeah, ok. The evidence suggests that Mr. Franklin and his ex-wife, if, in point of fact, she is his ex-wife, engineered all of this. Profit: Around $400,000, which amount Amy will get because she has a perfect case and perfect alibis. All the money, especially if the senior partner meets with an unexpected suicide. Except what she pays her cheap goon. And he may be doing it for free. You know, I never touched her. I mean, I touched her. We, uh, we necked. But I never really-- yeah. Yeah. I don't understand. If she really did all those things, what did she need me for? She had those other guys. What did she even bother with me for? I was just extraneous. I didn't fit into her plan. She didn't need me. She just used me. Are you going to arrest her? No. What are you going to do? Nothing. Somebody's got to do something, don't they? Yes. Well, who? You. Me. Yeah. Why me? Malcolm... We have 3 options. One tonight, two tomorrow. Tomorrow's options are either the Los Angeles police department will hit this town, and hard, and/or the United States army led by colonel stryker, and they'll be out for blood, and you know whose. And so they'll get her. So what? She's obviously right in the middle of it. Yeah. Says who? Says who? Listen, maybe she's floating around the edges somewhere. But who says she's in the middle? Malcolm, for goodness sake. Her alibis are grotesque. They draw attention to the fact that they're alibis. Is she trying to say something? You've known her for months and you like her, and I like her. Which leads to our last option. Do you two have a date tonight? Yeah. Good. I have an idea. Oh. Stryker: San Diego. They're waiting for me. Do you have to ride with it all the way? My job, Abel. What's your final destination? The pacific. Ha ha ha! That's what's called a tactical evasion. Oh. I don't like not knowing exactly what happens. It's my job to follow through, not walk away. David Franklin. He's dead, colonel. It does get back to the girl, doesn't it? Washington dug up something. Amy Franklin's father, McGregor, regular army, deceased, recruited David Franklin. Mmm. Did Washington agree to the purchase price? They had no choice. $407,500 in hard cash. I don't know how she did it, but she did it, and it's a first. What's a first? Scamming the United States army and maybe getting away with it. No, thanks. I've got to go. Do me one favor, Abel. I'll try. Unscam it. Tonight ok? Tonight? I've got a little plan. You didn't tell me. I know. I know. I'll call you in Guam. Guam? How'd you know it was Guam? Have a nice sail. This is fantastic. I didn't know we had this. I want it. For what? We don't have it, Fred. I have it. It's mine. What is it? Gloria: What is it? You do understand he doesn't understand what it is. You think you can handle that, Fred? Handle it? Shoot, I'm a marine. Well, ex-marine. That's right, marine. I can ride a horse and love a woman. Or is it vice versa? Is it legal? It's legal, for hunting an elephant. We got a lot of those in Jasper lake. Gloria, there's a lot of weird things in Jasper lake. You don't need an elephant gun for them, John, maybe just a little mascara. Anyway, Abel's always telling US, we got to be polite to everybody. You never can tell who's going to be our next senator. Well... We're ready. It's early. It's 11:00. You got to give her time, and him time. I hope this works. So do the taxpayers. Have you got any proof? I don't think I'll need a gun. Abel, do you have any proof? Maybe I'll take this one. Or is this just a hunch? Maybe it's just intuition. Gloria, do you have any of your marvelous cocoa? Guys, he's not answering you. He's not even talking to you. He's talking to me. Abel, you got any proof? Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Now don't do anything dumb. As if that would be a first. I'll be back. You'd better get back. You got dishes to wash. Want a new fridge? Do you know how long we've had this one? Your mother. It was her wedding present. I thought she gave US the stove. That was your sister. Emma? Donna Marie. What'd Emma give US? A ladder. Yeah? Where is that ladder? Will you go away so you can come back? We'll fix this tomorrow with some glue. No. Tomorrow we'll get a new fridge. How will we pay for it? We'll sell the ladder. Evening, Mrs. Beezly. Evening, Malcolm. How are you tonight? Oh, I'm fine. Thank you, ma'am. Is Amy around? Yes, Malcolm. She's upstairs in her room. Would you like me to get her for you? Yes, ma'am. Thank you. If you wouldn't mind. Oh, it'd be a favor, Malcolm. I am irrevocably buttsprung. Amy, you in there? Yes, Mrs. Beezly. I'm here. Coming. Your young man's downstairs. The skinny one. His name is Malcolm. I know. Malcolm rossiter Jr. I knew his father. I'll bet you did. Abel said to take our time so it looks like I convinced you to take me there. Like you spilled the beans. That's not all I've spilled. What a waste. How can you ride that thing? It'd give you uremic poisoning. What are you talking about? This thing's fun and is good for your health. Right. I'll see you on the dialysis machine. I'll take the shed. You take the outhouse. It's time to go. [Engine starts] Amy... Why'd you do it? I didn't do it. Oh, I don't mean the truck. I mean the men. What men? What men? Never mind. Never mind! So come on. Sit down. Please. 1012. 1012. Unbelievable. Yeah. It is, isn't it? Apparently it took Abel a little while to figure it out. About a minute, minute and a half. Of course, Vernon didn't put down the first 3 numbers because every phone in Jasper lake has the same exchange. Qu7. Qu7-1012. So Abel dialed it and it answered... Robinhood inn. Don't. Don't. He'll kill you. He'll kill anything. Up. Stryker: Put the gun on the table. Now the car keys. Now let's all sit down. So you figured out who snuffed the farmer, huh? He went looking for Abel to tell him he'd seen somebody rigging the road. So he found me. Bad luck for farmer brown, huh? Amy, I want you to sign these papers where you see an "x." That was stupid. You just admitted that you blew up the truck and killed Vernon. That's true, corporal-- deputy? That's fine, Amy. Now the last one. The power of attorney. Now when you endorse this, we'll be done. You're not stupid. You're crazy. Certifiable. There's no possible way you can get away with this. That's all, Amy. Thank you. Now take this young man's car. Go to town and pack. Amy, don't do it. We'll catch you, both of you. Sure you can catch her. So what? She hasn't done anything. She's passed over some land for payment. That's no crime. That's a good deal. That's democracy. You made her sign that check. I asked her to sign it, and she signed it. She's a generous, giving girl. Always was. As for me, you'll never find me. You see, there's no colonel Edward stryker. You can't catch a fellow who ain't there. Let's go, captain. On the double. I'm certainly willing to try. What do you think I should do first? Abel, where's stryker? He's headed for the Jeep in one of those sheds. You all right? Yeah, but what about stryker? Fred has that situation in hand. Fred? [Starts engine] Next. Malcolm, may I have the key, please? Where'd he find you? The boarding house. Waiting. Where's the colonel? The colonel is safe and moderately sound. He'll spend tonight at the county lockup at horse mountain, and tomorrow the army will come and take him away. And you, too, maybe. I guess. I don't know. I don't know what they'll do with you. Key, please, Malcolm. Ok. Ok. I'm coming. You told me to see if I could find her. Well, I found her. I didn't tell you to arrest her. Oh, no? Why not? Sit down. You sound like Fred. Sit down. Why'd you do what that guy told you to do? Why'd you sign the papers? Why'd you just get up and leave like an obedient child because he told you to? Because she is an obedient child. The colonel's my father, Malcolm. He co-developed 412 with my ex-husband David. Then the congress said, "no good. Dump it." And dad went a little crazy. And yes, I was the device. My father invented a man named stryker who never existed. Then he engineered his own death and took over stryker's identity. Long scam. Until he killed Vernon. And David said, "no. Wrong. Too many killings. End of scam." So dad killed David. And so I agreed to help Abel stop him from killing somebody else, like me....Or you. When did you find out about this? Jake the wrangler, Jake the wife-beater, told me he made love with Amy, and I happen to know from his ex-wife and from court evidence that's physically impossible for Jake to do with anybody. Which is, I suppose, one of the reasons he used to beat up people. That leaves tiny. Yes. You did spend the night with tiny, didn't you? Yes. For an alibi? Yes. I think I went too far with tiny. I think he thinks that means we're engaged. Dad said he would kill you if I didn't. So I did. How do you like them apples, Malcolm rossiter? For goodness sake, why are you staring at me? Have I got something on my shirt? [Car pulls up] Here he is. Good morning, Malcolm. You look awful. Here's the receipt for her, Abel. Want some coffee? Never again. They took her away in a truck, an army truck. It was like a hearse, only it had a lock. One officer, a major in army intelligence, two mps, male. One mp, female. I never saw a female mp before. So they put her in the back of the truck, locked it, gave me a receipt. Just like a meat market. Then they climbed in it and drove away. One snappy little drumroll. Then good-bye Amy Franklin. Malcolm, I hesitate to mention this in your present state, but there are others. That's not important. What's important is that there's only one you. Thank god. I got enough competition in this town as it is. Hey, you know that little honey that rides that two-seater bicycle? Ginger something or another. Well, now this is boring to me, Malcolm, but she's got the hots for you. Truth. Truth. I mean, lord knows why. Come on. It's the truth. Hey, it's as baffling to me as it is to you. And listen, I tried. I really tried. I couldn't get to first base with her. She wouldn't even let me hold her hand, let alone anything else. Gross. Listen, all she offered me were questions about Malcolm. Ginger grisnick. She's a really lovely girl, Malcolm. Really. Ginger grisnick? Lovely name. Look, I know what you people are doing. I know what you're up to. It's obvious. It's as obvious as hell. I like it. [Cheering] Well, I got to go open the office. [Stifled laughter] Did you know that boating is the number two recreational pastime in america? I hate to ask. What's the first? Oh, I have plans coming on that. Photographs and everything. People are doing it all the time.
