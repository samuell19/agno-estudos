Who was the guy in the suit? Written by Teruo Ishii Yoko Mihara Teruo Yoshida Junko Ikeuchi Directed by Teruo Ishii Who are you? You're very good-looking! Next time let's have some fun. 'Bye. What the hell?! Talk at the station. What are you talking about?! Don't give me that. We saw you and your partner. I never saw that before! Damn! She took my wallet! Drop the act, huh? You've got it all wrong! I don't know anything! Reiko, can I come, too? Come where? Silly! To meet Mr Yoshioka when the police let him go! The Section Chief got him out. He doesn't need me. Don't be so mean! He's your boyfriend! I sympathize. But getting arrested as a pickpocket's accomplice? I'll tell him you said that. Fine. There's nothing between us. Don't get the wrong idea. Oh, sure! The teary-eyed meeting at the prison gates! I'd love to see that! I'm sorry. What a mess, huh? Bad luck! What happened? Sorry to cause all this trouble. So where did Reiko go? Why, if it isn't Reiko! Come in! I'm so glad to see you again! So am I! You're looking great! It's been two months! How long are you here for? I have to fly back tonight. You're no fun! It's business. I just wanted to see your face. Well, now you've seen it. Don't talk like that! Be nice to me! No! I'm angry at you. I'll be back next week. I'll bring you something nice. You will? Damn right! Then I forgive you. Unzip me. What's your hurry? They'll complain at work if I'm late. What a nuisance! It's enough to drive a man to tears! Your skin is so smooth! You're so beautiful! What's wrong? I'll just go pretty myself up. Hey! You're fine now! Now, you be a good boy and wait quietly. Yes, ma'am. I hate nosy men! I wonder if you'd accept a transfer to Osaka... Osaka?! It's a branch office, but the work's not much different. Well? Yes, sir. They'll find you a place to live and everything. But sir... You can do a turn down there and come back. As it happens, they need someone right now. You leave Monday. Monday?! You'll need to pack. Your ticket's bought. You're on the 7 a.m. train. Take the rest of the day off and get your things ready. I have to talk to you. Meet me at 5:30 at the usual place. Type this for the Section Chief. Why did you agree to a transfer to Osaka? What could I say? The Director asked me, and the paperwork's done. And I'm in disgrace over that pickpocket thing, too. So you deserve it? I don't think so... ...but it can't be helped. What about us? You don't care if I'm here and you're in Osaka? But what can I do? Say it! What? You don't want to go. To who? Mr Morikawa! The Director? He'll listen. I guarantee it. Now we've got that decided, we'd better act fast. Go ask him right away. You'll do that if you love me. Why not come to Osaka with me? No! If we got married now, we'd be poor. We couldn't live... ...on just your salary. Are you angry? No. Then say something. I'm thinking. Don't think. Just do it. Go see him now. Please? Oh, all right. I'll go see him. Stick to your guns! Tell me how it goes! Do those take your fancy? Well! A face from the past! It's been years! That's good. I'm sure you don't want to see too much of me. No, I wish we'd become friends. I have dreams about you. Don't be sarcastic. I've got no grudge against you. I'm telling the truth! You were my first arresting officer! So I'm in your nightmares... No, I'm grateful. Without you I'd never have gone straight! Oh, you're smooth! There was a case yesterday involving a pretty girl. What happened? She made a very clever escape. When I heard about it, something clicked. Of all the nerve! Don't look at me like that! You're horrible! Are you OK? I sprained my ankle. Go buy me some salve. I'm on duty... Don't you serve the people? I'm a taxpayer! Is there a drugstore around here? There's one on the corner. I'll pay you back. Cops don't make much, you know... Hey! Come here a minute. Hey, mister... Police Where did you find this? A pretty lady said to give it to an old man with shifty eyes. So will you cancel Mr Yoshioka's transfer or not? So will you cancel Mr Yoshioka's transfer or not? And if I don't? I'll tell them about you and me. But then you'll never be able to marry Yoshioka. And you won't be a Department Director any more. If I admit it. But if I deny it, and say you're not just a typist... ...but a call-girl employed by a certain organization... ...who will people believe? Let's not talk that way. Will you cancel the transfer? OK. You win. But tonight, let's you and I have a real farewell party. Mr Yoshioka's going to your place to talk to you. So go home, will you? Oh, come on! At least tonight... No! I'll introduce you to someone nice instead. You will? Don't look so happy! And I'd like something for a farewell gift, as well. Something a man like you might call 'a check'. You don't mince words, do you. I didn't bring a check-book. How's that? Is that all? I could make it less. Hey! Just sign it. What time does Mr Morikawa usually get back? We operate like a hotel here, so unless a resident asks... ...we have nothing to do with the rooms. My name is Yoshioka. Could you say I'd like to see him and I'll come back tomorrow? Mr Yoshioka? Certainly. Thank you. All old men. Hello. Hi. How've you been? Were you away? I spent a week taking a foreign buyer from Nara to Kobe. Sanko Trading? They like to spend money. Was it fun? Tiring. You spend all day walking around tourist places. Then you work all night, too. You wake up 'drawn'. And not just from posing. Hey, Yukiko... Can I see the boss? He's free right now. Meet the guy in the glasses at the Cattelya at 9:30. That old guy? He looks like a professor! He's already paid. You can settle in the office. OK. You bitch! Come back later. Tomorrow's fine. Anyway, I'm quitting. You think you can? Is that a threat? I'm tougher than the other girls, you know. And if I say no? Then the Vice Squad will get an anonymous letter... ...about how prominent companies are supplied... ...with beautiful young women... ...with just one telephone call to the 'Croquis Sketching Club'. Interesting... OK... ...try it. Why don't you try that? Well! It's been a while. No, it hasn't. Strange I should see you, though. What's strange about it? There's lots of twisted men following beautiful girls in Ginza. And also girls wandering around Ginza who are very interested... ...in what other girls have in their handbags. There are?! Oh, dear! That's scary! 'Scary', huh? Oh, thanks for the other day. I met a friend and... left. I have your salve. How's your ankle? It's much better, thanks. Young people heal quickly. Youth and beauty, eh? Oh, 'Su-san'! You sweet-talking devil! It's 'Detective Sudo', please. I'm sorry. Can I buy you a drink to say thank you? Sorry. I'm on duty. On a case? Protecting Japan-U.S. relations. Carry on. Maybe next time. Bye-bye. Reiko? Reiko, it's me. Are you in bed? Can I help you? No, thanks. You said you'd wait up! Damn you! Is Mr Morikawa back? I'm sorry. ...Reiko Takigawa... ...a typist for Sanko Shipping, was found strangled this evening... ...in her Shibuya apartment. Police are treating as a suspect a young man... ...seen leaving the scene just before the body was found. The company's Sales Director told police that Miss Takigawa... ...was engaged to a colleague, Hiroshi Yoshioka... ...who faces transfer to Osaka after a work-related error... It's you! You got me into this! Let go of me! What will people think? What?! I won't run. We'll take the family car. What's wrong? Miss? Is there a problem? Nothing serious. What day is it today? It's Saturday. Of course! Yesterday was Friday. Thanks. 'Bye. You meet all kinds... Wait! That's enough tag. You're not scared? Not a bit. You've got nerve. And you're nervous. Whatever. Give me my wallet. OK, but on two conditions. What? I want to sit down. Let's go somewhere and talk. Here? Two highballs, White Horse. Make them singles. Yes, ma'am. Two questions. Why did you run when I called the cops? Are we in the same business? No! Then what, I wonder... Tell me the truth. I'm a believer in justice. Later. Where's my wallet? OK, OK! But you have to answer my question. What's so important in here? What's that card? Where did you steal... You got this from me? I swear! When and where, please. Sunrise Hotel, Room 6. 1 0 o'clock sharp. Fine. What was that all about? I don't know. But it sounds like fun. This is getting interesting! Bring some walnuts. You know what I like best in the world? Thrills. And... ...handsome men. You mean me? Yeah... for now. Let's go seek some thrills. How? We wait. The Sunrise Hotel, 1 0 o'clock. Come in. I've been waiting! Have a drink. I had too much last night. It's bad for my looks. That's too bad. So... do you approve? Yeah. You're gorgeous. So I can stay till morning? Oh, sure. Wait... I could use a bath... But... Yeah, I guess so. We should get it over with first. Then we can take it easy. Do you mind? That's not why... What, don't you like me? That's not it. Then let me stay. You know it's ?8,000 for the night, don't you? My money's checked with my coat. I'll pay you tomorrow. I can't do that. I have to leave real early in the morning. Miss... you know what this is. I have a few questions. If not... He has a short temper, Miss. You never know what he'll do. So answer us before you get hurt. I don't know anything. I was just asked to come here. Who do you work for? Tell me his name. You don't have to, but... A girl on the switchboard at work introduced me. After work, I call a Mr Deguchi from 'Bacchus' every two hours. And? That's all. I don't even know what Mr Deguchi looks like. 'October 28th: overnight rate. Artistic type, 50ish. 'Wouldn't leave me alone. I hated him.' 'November 1 6th: hourly rate. Bald, executive type. 'Bought dinner, but stingy.' Your appointment book? 'November 21 st: Tokyo Station. Golfer, number 1 3.' He's why you have to leave early tomorrow? When I called Bacchus earlier, that's what they told me to do. How will he know you? I'm supposed to be carrying a 'Winky' doll. OK. You're not going tomorrow. I'll be at Tokyo Station instead. Please! Don't tell anyone I told you! I could get killed! I understand. Tetsu... Tell them you did what you were told. Tetsu, bring the Winky. Don't worry. I'll keep your secret. Sweet dreams. I can't wait that long! Settle down... take it easy! This isn't a game! And it's all because you stole my wallet! I feel responsible. But I wish you'd tell me why it got you... ...into so much trouble. Mr Morikawa told the police... ...we decided on a lover's suicide because I'd been sent to Osaka... ...but when I saw Reiko dead I got scared and ran. And the police believe what he told them? They dusted for fingerprints. The radio said mine from work matched the ones on her doorknob. That's natural. So I don't have an alibi! I was just wandering around. So what will you do? Hey! Someone's coming. Excuse me, have you got a light? Keep them. Thanks a lot. Come on. So you have Mr Morikawa's card, he sends you to Osaka... ...then goes to the police? Yeah... Anyway, that card's all we've got to go on. Cheer up! Your train leaves the day after tomorrow. I'll solve this case, and get you on that train. Thanks. You go find that bar, 'Bacchus'. And you? I'll go meet that girl's customer at Tokyo Station in the morning. When will I see you? Under the Hattori clock, the day after tomorrow at 6 a. m... ...just before your train. See you then. Ow! Excuse me, Miss... Do you mean me? Excuse me if I'm wrong... ...but this card... I've looked all over! Sorry to keep you waiting. Let me check my clubs. I said I'd be back home tonight, so I can't go too far away. Is there somewhere near here we can relax? Well, I'm kind of new at this. I wouldn't know. You wouldn't, eh? Let's think about it in a taxi, then. Hey, mister... why don't you come with me? I want a nice car. It's a brand-new '61. Rides like a dream. Leave it to me. Here... ...hop in. Have a good time! Thanks! Where to, sir? Just drive. Cute, huh? May I? Bacchus 'The Croquis Club'... the same mark as that card! Le Frances This is a nice place, isn't it. I feel young again when I breathe the same air as a girl like you. You sound like you've brought lots of geishas to places like this. Well, maybe... How many men have you brought to places like this? Come on, confess. Tell me. Well... Eighteen? I guess I'll take a bath. Come in with me. Be right with you. You know, mister... Hurry up! It's not very big... It's made that way. This fell out of your jacket when I hung it up. What is it? Dry grass. What's it for? Medicine? I put it on my trousers when I go home, to prove I was golfing. There's a dry-grass store at the station. Very convenient. Very. Come on in the bath! Coming. Good morning. Miss... Who was the guy in the suit? The manager. A good-looking guy. I'll bet the girls like him. Miss... What's her name? Akiko. So that's what you really wanted to know! Thank you. Taxi! You're fast... ...but not fast enough. That was pretty stupid. You're right. So now what? Hmm... It'd be a waste to take you to the police. At least let go of my arm. You're hurting me! Hello? One moment, please. Akiko! Telephone. Thanks. Hello? Akiko speaking. Guys with money to spend come here in the evening... ...with this card. It's members only. All classy guys. Yeah, naked. You don't lose anything. You make money without picking pockets. How much is up to you. Well, maybe I'll give it a try. You've got a good body. Bust 99, waist 64, hips 99. The foreigners'll like that. I meet international standards. Yeah? The guys'll love those boobs. My old boyfriend used to say... ...I was like a transistor radio. What did he mean? I had good reception. Maybe I should tune you in. A girl like you makes a guy want to let go. Handling the merchandise is for cheap thugs. Taxi! You sure had me fooled! You're the guy who's been following me all day. You knew? I had a feeling. How did you know my name? Oh, I have ways. Whatever. But if you're a member, why didn't you just ask for me? Why give the club money... ...when I can give it to you? That's nice, but there'll be trouble if they find out. But in Asakusa they'll never find out. It'll be a thrill! You know Asakusa? I started there. Let's not go straight to a hotel. Let's go somewhere first. Sure. Take me somewhere thrilling. Leave it to me. So you've been here for three years, too? It's hard to quit, even if you'd like to. Because nowhere else pays so much? They take just about everything we make! This place is awful. Be careful. Yeah? But the girls they send to big companies seem to do well. Those are the A class girls. But they end up like Reiko. Reiko? It was in today's paper. I'm not just telling you because you bought lunch... You're wanted in the other room. Watch what you say to the new girl, OK? Come on! You can't leave now! You promised! But you ask all these questions about the club! Like some reporter! You're not a reporter, are you? Look at me! Do I look that smart? No. You look kind of dumb, actually. 'Duh! ' So why all the questions? I have a taste for the bizarre. I know a place. Great! World Premier! The Flower Train Dance Not another strip show, I hope... Nothing so dull. Something very unusual. You'll be amazed. Yeah? Just come with me. Where are you going? Just over the way. You're an important guest. If I let you out of my sight... ...l'll catch hell from the boss. I feel all closed in. Just go and relax with the others. Hi. I'm late! Well, I'm going. Gee, sorry! Yuck! That's filthy! I'm being held prisoner in the Croquis Club... ...4th Floor, Shinbashi Building. Call the police. Mayumi Oda. What are you doing? Just some sketching. Honey... ...come on in. You must be tired. No. Now you're going to see something really bizarre. Come on, honey, loosen up. I'll find you a good job. You don't have to worry. Thank you. Well... ...in return you have to do exactly as I say, all right? No! Stop it! No! Stop! Keep quiet! No! No! Stop! What are you doing?! Quiet, you little bitch! What do you think you're doing?! We can't just watch this! Idiot! They won't let you just walk out of here, you know! But I can't just... Keep quiet! I don't want to get hurt here, or even killed! Hey... Don't cry. I'll take real good care of you from now on. Let's get out of here. I'll call the police. Keep me out of it, then. You keep watch, then. I'll go. Hey... what's the matter? Aren't you going? If we tell the police, they'll want to know about us. I know! I'll phone them! Man, am I stupid! Come on. Hello. You're awful! You always keep me waiting for you! Two juices. Get off the phone! Look... It's that girl! What's going on here?! You said you liked the bizarre, so I took you to a show. A show?! I used to do that kind of work myself. But Asakusa's small-time, and the club I'm with now... ...made me a better offer. So pay up. Their performance fee. I paid them in advance. How much? Was it too intense for you? Typist Found Strangled! A Love Suicide? What's wrong? I think I'll be going. I've read it. So what? I didn't see the morning paper. I didn't know. The girl who was killed worked at our club. Reiko Takigawa?! She must have done something to get herself killed. Tell me what you know! The reporter again? You're very easily shocked. I'll be all right this time. If you want to sleep with me, go through the club. I don't want to end up like her. Hey! Why did you rob the guy? I don't know anything! Don't give me that! Cry all you like. I'm sure you know how. It's time we heard the truth. It's true! The man had a gun! So I did what he told me! So the woman who robbed our customer must have been... ...the woman with him. Yes. I wouldn't lie to you. But we won't know for sure till we see her. Card 1 8... that's Mr Morikawa, isn't it? I'll check. That's the one. So someone lifted it from a guy Morikawa gave it to... Yeah. That's the guy we want. Is that all they pay?! I'm not taking my clothes off for nothing! I'll go talk to them. I wouldn't do that! Don't worry. Hey! We don't want you leaving this room. I want to talk to the boss! Later. You're up next. I'll be waiting. Croquis Club Good evening. Thank you. Take him in. That way, please. Change! Number 1 8?! Let's see if he's the guy from last night. I'm tired! If I ask for you, can you get away quickly? Hey... I like this model. Can I ask for her? Yeah, she's nice. Come with me. Take a good look at him. We're bringing the girl you asked for. You're popular. Someone's asked for you already. Interested in me? What's wrong with him? Get dressed. Lend me this. Sure. What's up? Give me a smoke. You killed Reiko Takigawa and framed me for it! Knowing that won't help you now. My headache now is what to do with your bodies. You're a real pain in the neck. You bring each other bad luck. All this because you stole a worthless card from him. I can't help it. My finger has a life of its own. But what would have happened if I'd never met Mr Yoshioka? Mr Yoshioka... ...would've given us back Mr Morikawa's card... ...and it would've ended there. Damn this finger! And Reiko Takigawa? She'd've gotten herself killed someday. She was a shrew. Let's not be so rash here... Put that away. Shut up! Listen... ...can we talk? You're different, you know. You got an idea? Just thinking... Shooting us now wouldn't be smart. Even a silenced pistol in a basement still makes noise. That makes sense. It's the truth! Why not wait a while? You close at 1:30. The customers will be gone, and there'll be no one outside. All right. We'll wait till 1:30. Wonderful! Being able to breathe for even an extra hour... ...isn't a bad thing. You've got an hour to get all your talking done. Hands behind your back. Watch it. I've got a bad temper. Son of a bitch! Be a bit nicer! We're all out of nice. Tie her good and tight, too. Ow! So, honey... l'll see you one more time, later on. I'm honored. That hurts! Undo my zipper. Your zipper? What the hell for? I've got a knife in my slacks. Where did you get that?! Quiet! We're not discussing charity here! Hurry it up! Where did you get it? That stupid swank had his nail clippers in his pocket. I borrowed them when I hugged him. Bless your thieving little fingers! And your nerve. You're so clumsy! Hurry up and do something! I'm not very good at this. I've never done it before. I'm sure you'll like it. That tickles! Sorry. Women have pockets in the strangest places... I had it made special. A little more... You're not very lucky. We'll have to fall over. A little higher... Got it! Great! How's it going? Great. Yeah? How many more? Five. The perverts who stick around for the ugly ones. Three left, boss. Great! Untie me. How does it feel to have your fingers free again? Like my first elevator. What? It's a long story. Not this way. There might be a door this way. Dead end. Damn! Here's a way out! Quiet! Hey... there's a door over there. You keep watch. I'll try to pick that lock. Can you pick locks? My father was a specialist. I like him already! Idiot! Ow! Did I hit you? Are you OK, kid? Are you hurt? Watch out, kid. There's lots of unlicensed drivers around. I've got a walking license! A walking license? Of all the days to stay late! That's how it goes. When's the last train? 1:30. Mayumi... a girl like you makes me glad I was born. Shut up, will you? I can't concentrate! Look what you did! Sorry... it should go further. It's all crinkled up. It's open! We'll go down here. Quick! You'll be fine. Careful. Danger Keep Out Hey! It's no good. We'll have to go down. Don't! Someone'll hear! You stay here! This way! Hold it! Hold it! Damn you! It's the police! Quiet! You come with us. Why? He's under arrest for murder. What do you mean, 'murder'?! He could sue you, you know! Just kidding. We'll come, but speed things up, OK? We're in a hurry. Well, since we're old friends, I'll do what I can. I love you! If only you weren't a cop! Enough of that! Come on. You'll make your train! Am I going alone? What did you say? I didn't hear you. This is a great time to go deaf! I don't say things twice. You're awful! I don't know you. Goodbye. Hey, wait! I'm sorry!
