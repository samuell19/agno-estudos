Sorry we're so late, Mary, but it was such a soft night we walked all the way home. And then we had to count leaves and things. It's way past your bedtime, young man. I'm thirsty. You've got the outing tomorrow. You know we won't be back until late. There's lemonade in the icebox. You may have one glass if you promise that you won't-- I won't, I promise. I'm glad you two had a good time. All right, I had a couple. Only two. You know I wouldn't go past my limit. I wouldn't have had those if it hadn't been for Rufus. I mean it. You saw him come staggering in here. He insisted on stopping off for a little &quot;lotion,&quot; as he called it. I had a terrible time getting him home. The boy's a real hoister. Takes after his mother. I don't think that's funny, Jay. Ah, look! Oh, no, here it is. Oh, Jay! ( both laugh ) You're awful. Jesus did. Oh, well, maybe he did, but you're not. Finish that, up to bed. That is Jesus in his nightshirt, staying up after his bedtime to talk to the elders. Oh-- Shh. Oh, gracious, there's a lot to do before your people come tomorrow. Oh. Mary. ( gasps ) Are you all right? Oh, fine. Fine. It's to be expected for now. What's the matter, Mama? Oh, Mama just stooped over very quickly, that's all, and it made the room go round. The room isn't going around. Why don't you tell him, Mary? He's gonna have to find out sometime. He has to go to bed, that's what he has to do. Find out what, Mama? Rufus, come here to Mama. Um, after a while, you're going to have a wonderful surprise. What? If I told you, it wouldn't be a surprise anymore, would it? Will I get it tonight? Oh, not for a long time. Will I get it before the vacation's over? Way after that. We'll be getting ready for Christmas. RUFUS: I know what it is. A cap. No, it's not a cap. Is it like a present? Well... Something, only very much nicer. RUFUS: Where is it? It's in heaven. Still up in heaven. Oh, Jay... Rufus, come here, honey. Now, this surprise is something that your mama's getting, but she's gonna share it with us. And we have to help her get ready for it. So for the next few months, we won't ask her to do for us things that we can do for ourselves. Like, uh... Bedtime. But I haven't finished my lemonade. Good night, old google eyes. MARY: I'll turn down your bed, and I want to see you wash tonight with soap. Meet you out on the front porch for some good old rye whiskey. Or would you rather have lemonade? ( harmonica playing soft music ) ( Jay chuckles ) What? &quot;Jesus did.&quot; Oh. Ha, ha. Oh, I'm glad you didn't laugh when he said that to me. Or when you were telling him about the surprise, and he thought it was a cap. ( chuckles ) You know, I think he still does. He was looking at one in Harveson's window on the way back from the movies. You ought to tell him, Jay. He's too young for a cap. Too young? He was awful interested in Dallinger's window too. It seems that Dallinger's got a statue-- I know what he's got. Dallinger ought to be arrested. Hasn't Rufus ever seen you with no clothes on? Jay... I... Has he ever seen you? Once, maybe. He's seen himself. It won't be long anyways, Mary, before he's bound to notice that something's happening. Not if you don't bring it to his attention. Then he'll only hear about it from the older boys on the street, would you like that? Nasty little rowdies. It's one thing to tell him about the baby, Jay, but supposing he starts making connections between... Between one thing and another? Well, he's a lost soul already. I told you he was a heavy drinker. Anyway, I wanted to talk to Father Jackson about it first. You don't need a minister to tell you how to talk to your own boy. Especially one who puts on airs and calls himself a priest. And that stuff about the baby being up in heaven, it just sets my teeth on edge. We better get some sleep. It's a big day tomorrow. RUFUS: Papa! ( panting ) What's the matter? Papa. Hey, what's the trouble? Big boys don't cry. Here. Blow. Hard. Your mama don't like you to swallow that stuff. Now, what's wrong? Bad dream? Nothing here that ought not to be. Why, here's poor old Jackie. I haven't seen him in I don't know when. You're getting too big for Jackie. Well, then you're getting too big to cry. Poor little old lonesome one-eyed Jackie, laying back in that corner all this time. Hey, you're a good smeller. Can you smell the Christmas tree the year you got Jackie? You're getting sleepy. Boogeyman all scared away. Tell you what. I'll sing you one song, then you be a good boy and go to sleep. What would you like? &quot;Froggy.&quot; Ah, ha, ha. The one with a thousand verses, huh? No, sir. How about... * Where did you get Them great big google eyes? * * Where did you get Them great big google eyes? * * You're the best there is * * And I need you in my biz * * Where did you get Them great big google eyes? * ( bell clanging ) ( bell tolling ) ( train engine chugging ) Anybody home? ( doorbell rings ) MARY: Why, Aunt Hannah, how nice. I'm not coming in. Save you apologizing about the house not being picked up. I'm on my way to St. Agnes'. If I get there late, I'll have to sit in front pew. Where's Ma? Is she all right? Oh, sure. She's taken to going to early Mass now. The reason I stopped by-- MARY: Excuse my looking this way, but I have such a lot to do before Jay's people get here. They're driving down from LaFollette. Well, the reason I came-- I know why you stopped by, Aunt Hannah, and some Sunday I'll be going with you, but it may not be soon. There, now. That's all you know. I came by because I'm going shopping tomorrow, and I wondered if Rufus would like to go with me. I'm sure he'd love to. Well, I don't believe in asking mothers what their children would love to do. I believe in asking the children. I'll stop by tomorrow. WALTER: Morning, ladies. Good morning, Walter. Good morning, Mr. Starr. I'm on my way down to church. I'd consider it a favor to drive you ladies. ( phone ringing ) Well, um, which church are you driving to, Mr. Starr? WALTER: Preston Avenue Methodist, ma'am. You may take me as far as St. Agnes' Episcopal. Up to there, we will be under the protection of Our Lady. From there to your church, you travel at your own risk. ( laughs then clicks tongue ) ( children chattering ) ( crying ) Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey, what's going on? Now, what in the world are you doing, old google eyes? That's a funny name, just like Rufus. Now, that isn't a funny name. It is, and it's a nigger name. The big boys tell you that? I was wondering who was going to lick off this dasher. You come along just in time. You know, Rufus... Rufus is a very fine old name. Now, some colored people take it too, but that's perfectly all right and nothing for them to be ashamed of who take it. Now, you were given that name because it was your great-grandfather Lynch's name. Your mama's grandfather. That's a name to be proud of. And, Rufus... Don't ever speak that word &quot;nigger&quot; again. It's a mean word. I know you don't mean nothing by it, but it's used to hurt colored people's feelings. Papa... I don't wanna be mean to nobody. I was gonna suggest you save the south end of that dasher for your cousin Jim Wilson. But I reckon it wouldn't keep, huh? Why don't you go out front and let us know when they get here? Ralph just called on the telephone. Oh? Where from? Ten blocks away, just downtown. He called to say he was almost here. If you ask me, he was in a saloon. Just an excuse to poor Sally for stopping. He say anything about knocking Kaiser Wilhelm's block off? When they get here, Jay, I mean... Well, you won't let Ralph influence you, will you? Well, why not? You know, old Ralph and I may just stay right here and have ourselves a bender. I'm just about ripe for it. I don't like jokes about that particular subject. And you know what I don't like? Superintendents. ( car horn honking ) RUFUS: They're coming! They're coming! Whoa, Nellie! Whoa, girl! Yee-haw! Ha-ha! Now, please, Ralph, will you don't talk religion in front of Mary? You mean the pesky pagan? Oh, no, excuse me, Anglo-Catholic. Hey, you know what that is, Pa? That's a soft-shell Catholic that never learned Latin. ( Ralph cackling ) JAY: Hello. Hello, Jay. Hey, boy, we made it safe and sound. Well, where'd you get the new car? Like it? RUFUS: It says Mercer. 1,800 smacks, F.O.B. Detroit. She goes like an old six. Rufus, here's your cousin, Jim Wilson. Why don't you all come up on the porch? I thought we'd have a glass of something cold. You certainly do look fine, Ma. I'd have said so sooner, but I had to admire this car. You two. RALPH: All right, Ma. JOHN HENRY: I don't think I'll ever get used to riding automobiles. I don't seem to be able to keep up with all the work. Mary, baby don't show much yet, do it? Turn sideways. MARY: Why don't you all come up on to the porch? Jim Wilson, run on over there and play with your cousin Rufus. Hop in there, Jay. Jay, hop in there. Sit on these seats. Sit on these things, boy. Feel 'em. Feel 'em. That's real leather. That ain't oilcloth. What you trying to do, make me look like a piker? Well, you are a piker. A piker with that old tin lizzie. How do you like this color? Boy, I guess I should've picked black. It'd look better for my profession, but... It's just a butterfly. RALPH: That top there goes up and down easy as a window shade. Dad--! You-- You-- Jim Wilson, I've told you to keep them fingers off that trimming. Now, that's what ruins it. That's the trouble with a new car. You come too, Rufus. Where you going, Sally? I am taking them to the bathroom, if you must know. Do you want them to have an accident? Oh, just asking, that's all. I was just asking. Heh. These are comfortable, Pa. I'd ask you all into the house, but it's such a hurrah's nest. Some lemonade, Mother Follet? Wait on Pa first, if you will, Mary. You know how parched he gets. Hey, Ralph, I'd figured on us going out there in two cars, but with that new chariot of yours, why don't we just all go with you? ( toilet flushes ) Two with one flush. That's Sally. Economical. Ah. My, this is restful. No, here below's not meant to be restful. We'll get all the rest we need in the grave. JOHN HENRY: With my luck, the day they put me to rest, the next day will be resurrection. ( Mary speaking indistinctly ) RUFUS: Mama, can I help put things on the running board? ( Mary speaking indistinctly ) Smell my hands, Jay. Go on, smell 'em. There's nothing on your hands, Ralph. Yes, there is. That's formaldehyde. I can't smell it, but everybody else can. I scrub 'em and I scrub 'em, but I never can get rid of that smell. Ralph, you're just imagining things. You work in a law office. You don't walk around stinking of embalming fluid. You didn't sit down next to this girl in the picture show and have her get right up and move. ( car horn honking ) Everybody's waiting on us, Ralph. Yeah. Little wife and kidneys. Reformed booze fighter. Lord, ain't nothing more reformed than that. ( car horn honks ) Let Jim Wilson blow the horn now, honey. ( car horn honks ) Hey. Hey. Hey, Jay. You drive and I'll be the conductor. Hey. Hey, honey, your folks still live over on Forest Avenue? Yes. Why? Driver, I want you to go over the way of Forest Avenue. Boy, we're gonna give your in-laws a real treat. Move over, Rufus. ( groans ) ( car horn honking ) RALPH: New car! It's mine! Mine! I'm letting Jay drive it though. My car. My car. Just letting him drive it. What do you suppose that was for? Joel, that was Mary. I know. WOMAN: Andrew, that was Mary. I know, Mom. She told me they're driving up county to visit with Jay's great-grandma. Wonder what brought them by here. Ralph Follet advertising he's got a new machine. And that was to show Mary's folks that maybe their daughter married the wrong Follet. ( soft theme playing ) Jay, does she know we're coming? I don't see how she could. If it's been years and she's that old, how do we know that she's still... Anything happened to great grandma we'd have heard. JOHN HENRY: Oh, she's well taken care of. Sadie, my oldest sister, she's been staying out there with her, oh, ever since I can remember. Anything happened to great grandma, Sadie have gotten word to us. Hey, y'all, come on. Come on. Dadburnit, come on! Come on. Come on. ( snaps fingers ) Darned lemonade. ( chickens clucking ) SADIE: Lord above. Howdy, John Henry. Howdy, Sadie. SADIE: And that's Jessie, ain't it? Well, Lord God. Well, pile out, everybody. Pile out. I thought maybe you wouldn't have knowed us. SADIE: Why, I knowed y'all the minute I laid eyes on you. JAY: Howdy, Aunt Sadie. SADIE: This is Jay, ain't it? You're Ralph's brother? RALPH: Yes, ma'am, I'm Ralph, and this is my new car we came in. And over here is my bride Sally. Least that's the way I like to think of her. How do you do, Sadie? This is Mary, Aunt Sadie. SADIE: Proud to know you. I figured it must be you. JAY: This here's our boy Rufus. MARY: Say hello to Aunt Sadie, Rufus. Hello, Aunt Sadie. Rufus. RALPH: Jim Wilson, you come over here, boy. Give your Aunt Sadie a great big kiss and a hug. That's our boy, Aunt Sadie. SADIE: Lord, God. How's Grandma? Well... As good as we got any right to expect. But don't feel put out if she don't know none of you. Half the time, she don't even know me. RALPH: Poor old soul. SADIE: So if I was y'all, I'd come up on her kinda easy like. It's been a coon's age since she seen so many folks all at once. Me neither. It might scare her if you come gooping up on her in a flock. JAY: Why don't you go the first, Pa? You're the oldest. JOHN HENRY: No, it ain't me she wants to see, son. It's the young 'uns that tickle her the most. SADIE: We better just let her get used to the presence of folks before we go up on her. Well, I reckon she's used to you by now. Wait. Just wait here a minute. Grandma. You got company. You hear me, Grandma? You got company. Jay and his wife and the young 'un and the others come up from Knoxville to see you. ( moaning ) She knows you. Come on over, Jay. I'll tell her about the rest of you in a minute. RALPH: Don't wanna mix her up. ( goat bleats ) Now, don't holler. It'll only scare her. Just talk loud and plain right next to her ear. Grandma? I'm Jay, John Henry's boy. ( moaning ) SADIE: She knows you. Can't she talk anymore? Oh times she can and times she can't. Ain't ever so seldom cause for talk I reckon she loses the hang of it. But I figure she knows you and I'm tickled she does. Rufus. Come here, honey. Just call her Grandma. Go right up to her ear like you do to Grandma Lynch, and say, &quot;Grandma, I'm Rufus.&quot; Grandma, I'm Rufus. Come around here where she can see you. Say, &quot;I'm Jay's boy, Rufus.&quot; I'm Jay's boy, Rufus. JAY: Now kiss her. ( laughs ) ( laughing ) MARY: Jay. No. Leave them be. MARY: Is she all right? All she knows is something's been took from her. ( moans ) Lord, God. She's talking. What is it, Grandma? ( mumbles ) She says she's been borned again. ( soft theme playing ) ( upbeat theme playing ) Kitty. ( crickets chirping ) ( Mary singing indistinctly ) ( Mary laughs ) MARY: Oh, my, this is nice. JAY: * Go tell Aunt Rosie * JAY &amp; MARY: * Go tell Aunt Rosie * * Go tell Aunt Rosie * * The old gray goose is dead * ( laughing ) What? Oh, nothing. I'm awful. The old gray goose is dead. Can't help thinking that your brother'd be right there to get the burying business. ( both laugh ) Poor Ralph. He said that he'd handle everything when Great Grandma's time finally came. I'd be right proud to officiate. ( laughs ) Oh. I am terrible. ( soft theme playing ) Google-eyes asleep? Well! I hope the neighbors enjoyed that. ( tender theme playing ) Jay? What is it, Jay? I reckon it's just seeing Great Grandma again. Seeing Pa begin to shrink up. Feeling Rufus growing bigger. And singing them sad old songs. I reckon it's a lot of things, Mary. I know. JAY: You hold 'em, sing to 'em. Way back before you were even dreamed of in this world, someone was holding and singing to Great Grandma. Way back on a mountain. Past her, all the way back to Adam. Only, nobody ever sang to Adam. God did. Maybe God did. Oh, how far we all come, Mary, away from ourselves. So far, we can't remember where we started. Or where it was we thought we were going. All you know is you were going someplace. But we're supposed to come away from ourselves, Jay. That's the whole point. We're supposed to come away-- Yes, I know. I know. To God. I don't see how you can feel the way you do and not believe in him. We come from people, Mary. And in time, they all fall away from us. Like Great Grandma. Like Rufus. Like... And when we're 80 years old, you and me. All we'll have left is us. That's what I believe in. Maybe that's it. Maybe that's where we're heading. To each other. The sad thing is the distance between us. Maybe-- Maybe if we keep going in the direction we think is right... Maybe we can't ever get all the way there. But at least we can make that distance less than it was. ( laughs ) You just don't bend in the middle the way you used to. Clumsy me. I'll be glad when I can stoop again. So will I. Jay. I only meant I'll be glad when the baby gets here. What are you doing? Just taking the damp out for you. When I was a youngster on the farm, I didn't like to be in a big bed all to myself. I used to cry. Ma used to do this so I'd feel someone'd just been in it and might be back right away. Your job is to get the other side all comfortable for me. Other times, Ma used to bring me her pillow, put it under the covers next to me. Said I was to pretend it was one of them keeping me warm through the night and watching over me. Poor Ma. She slept without a pillow for a long time there. ( tender theme playing ) ( phone ringing ) JAY: I'm coming, damn it. Hello? Yeah, central, this is Jay Follet. Well, put him through. Hello, Ralph. What's the trouble, Ralph? RALPH: It's Pa, Jay. I come home specially to call you up. Listen, Ralph, I appreciate your calling. And your not putting me up. Now tell me about Pa. It's about Pa. He got sick. Lord God, Jay, it looks like the end, boy. Well, that's entirely up to you, Jay. Ralph, I take it you had a doctor. What's he say? The way you say it, I expect the doctor says a good chance. All right, all right. I'm starting right up. I ought to be in LaFollette-- What time is it, Mary? MARY: Ten after 3. It's 10 after 3, Ralph. I ought to be there a little after 5. That's the best my old tin lizzie can make it. Roger. Lord, talking to him is like putting socks on an octopus. Is he... Is it bad? Lord knows. With Ralph telling it, I can't be sure. But I can't afford to take the risk. No. Of course not. Try to be brave now. But if you wanna cry your heart out, why, that's only natural. You just lean on me. ( whispers indistinctly ) Just let me be, Ralph. ( soft theme playing ) What a heavenly night, Jay. Oh, I wish I could come with you. Yeah, I wish you could, dear. I wish you could. I mustn't keep you. It's time to go. ( tender theme playing ) Good night, Mary. Oh, it's such a lovely night. Don't you come one step farther. Holy hot jumping death! Jay! ( engine starts ) ( soft theme playing ) MARY ( whispering ): Dear... I've a dear. Why did Papa have to go? Because Grandpa is very sick and might not get well again. And if you can't get well again, then God lets you go to sleep. Don't you ever wake up again? Oh, you wake up right away in heaven. Only the people one earth can't see you anymore, and you can't see them. Oh. Now, when Aunt Anna comes to take you shopping today, you remember what you're to say to her. Uh-huh. Mama? Mm-hm? When my rabbits went to sleep, did they wake up in heaven too? I don't know, Rufus. I imagine they woke up in a part of heaven that God gave especially for rabbits. Did they wake up all bloody like they were? No, Rufus, that was only their poor little bodies. God wouldn't let them wake up all hurt and bloody, poor things. Then why did God let the dogs get in? ( sighs ) Now, don't dawdle and butter this while it's still hot. I bet they sneaked in when he wasn't looking. Because he sure wouldn't have let them in if he'd been there, didn't they, Mama? No, Rufus. We believe that God is everywhere, and knows everything, and nothing can happen without his knowing. But the devil is everywhere too. Everywhere except in heaven that is. And he's always tempting us. And when we do what he tempts us to do then God lets us do it. What's &quot;tempt?&quot; Tempt is, uh... Well, the devil tempts us when there's something we want to do, but we know it's bad. Why does God let us do bad things? He doesn't want us to do bad things, but to know good from bad, and be good from our own hearts. But if God can do anything, why doesn't he make us be good? Because he doesn't want to. Why doesn't he want to? It would be easier for him. God doesn't believe in the easy way. Not for us. Not for anything or anybody. Not even for himself. God wants us to come to him and to find him, the best we can. Do I have to wear my hat? What? It's a baby hat. Do I? Oh, Rufus. Yes. ( phone ringing ) Oh! That must be Papa. Hello? Yes, central, go ahead. It is Papa. Jay? Oh, that's wonderful, Jay. Then he's out of danger? Oh, dear. So you went all that way for nothing. Yes, he's right here. Hold on a minute. Hello? Uh-huh. Fine. Fine. When will you be home, Papa? He has to stay awhile to help out because Uncle Ralph isn't feeling good. But he'll be home for supper. And he said to give you this. Goodbye, Papa. And don't forget your hat. Hello, it's me, Jay. Yes, and I thank you for it too, only he got me all over toast and crumbs. Heh. And there's oatmeal in the telephone. Jay, don't hurry if it means driving fast. I'd rather hold supper than have you race. All right, darling. Thank you for calling. Mwah. Bye. ( upbeat theme playing ) ( laughs ) Those are the poor little orphan children over in a place called Belgium. They are orphans because they have no mother and no father. My, land. Why don't I give them these old shoes? I just got new ones. These have miles of walking in them, and they're all broke in. Wouldn't you like to help the orphans too, Rufus? ( giggles ) Kiddo could wear that in church and they wouldn't throw him out. You look here. This boy sits in church, he's bare-headed. What he wants is something he can wear to a cat and dog fight. Now, you just let him see something sporty. Well, now, why didn't you say so? Kiddo is looking for real class, we got what we call a Chesbo. ( whistles ) Really, Aunt Hannah, that cap. I don't think I'll ever forgive you. I don't blame you. ( both laugh ) I'm glad you stayed. You can just be here when Rufus tells his father who bought him that awful cap. If I know Jay, he'll go out and get himself one just like it. He's just apt to do that. In a way I'm glad he is late. At least that means he isn't rushing. ( phone ringing ) Darlin', I'm now on the kitchen road, and I just finished a big bowl of chili. I hope you didn't waste supper. Hello? Would you talk a little louder? I can't hear you. I said I can't hear you. Will you talk a little louder, please? Thank you. What is it? Yes, this is Mrs. Follet. ( plays notes ) Yes. Yes. ( sighs ) Yes, there's my brother. Where should he come to? Twelve miles out on the Ball Camp Pike. Brannick Flackston's truck. Yes, I've got it. Oh, he'll be out there just as fast as he can. You were very kind to call. Thank you very much. ( taps phone ) Two-three-seven, please. ( phone ringing ) ( organ playing upbeat music ) Hello? Hello? Andrew? Mar? Mary? Oh, my God, Mary. Jay's been in an accident. What? ( organ music stops ) Of course I will, Mary. Where is he? Twelve miles. Out the Ball Camp Pike. I've got it. I'll get Walter started driving out right away. His brother has a machine. How bad is it? Hold it, Mary. How bad is it? Mary? Where is he hurt? You mean you didn't ask? Jay's been in an accident. Look, look, Mary. I'm just wasting time. Now, don't you worry. I'll let you know as soon as I find out. I'll phone you. Bye, Mary. How about we have some tea? Fine. Fine. That's a good idea. Let me-- What? Is there anything I can do? Oh, not a thing. Thank you, Aunt Hannah. You sit down. This'll be ready in a jiff. The maid's room! The what? That's what Jay called it. It's the spare bedroom. I'm ashamed because I haven't cleaned it in a thousand years. We let Rufus play in it on rainy days, coloring and stuff. Why don't I get it ready in case he's well enough to be brought home? That's a good idea. It's very possible that he might have to be taken straight to a hospital. The man did say it was serious, after all. Well, how's that water? ( laughs ) Oh, sakes alive, the watched pot. I suppose we'll just have to wait. Why didn't he tell me? Why didn't I ask? Didn't I care? I didn't even ask how serious. Where is he hurt? Is he living or dead? That we'll simply have to wait to find out. Don't you think I know that? Of course we have to. That's what's so unbearable. I'm sorry. It's just that it... It's such an important thing to say. So simple to say. At least he could give me some general idea as to whether he could go home or to a hospital, or... And surely, if he meant the very worst, he would've just told me so straight out and not leave us all on... On tenterhooks. ( tense theme playing ) Did Rufus pick out that cap all by himself? You don't think I chose that monstrosity, do you? He was all set to pick a very gentile little surgerer. A goodie-goodie tweed, but I... I smelled the hypocrisy. I was thinking of a story Jay told me once. Happened when he was a little boy. It seems that there was this-- This woman who put on a lot of airs. &quot;A wonderful host&quot; Jay called her. Anyway, it seems that this woman went out and bought a big, enormous hat. All covered with big, enormous, velvet roses. Just to wear to a funeral. Anyway, they go out to the burial and it's-- It's one of those country services, you know, like the Cumberlands? And everybody's got his head bowed low and only... Only her hat's not pinned. Ha-ha! And it falls to the ground just at the point that the minister is gonna throw the wreath into the-- ( both laugh ) Anyway, he picks up her new hat, and he throws it right into the open-- Right on top of the-- And then the sexton shoveled in about a ton of dirt. ( both laughing ) And Jay said that that woman was so mad they thought she just murder that minister for throwing it in. ( both laughing ) You know what he really said? No. He said that she was mad enough to put on her copper-toed boots and go to a butt-kicking contest. ( both laughing ) Oh, we're terrible joking about things like that. At least I am. I'm just ashamed of myself. ( sobbing ) That man on the phone. Why didn't I ask him? And what's keeping Andrew? He should've phoned by now. Unless he's had an accident. ( sobbing ) If he dies... If he's dead, Aunt Hannah, I don't know what I'll do. I just don't know what I'll do. Now, now, you'll do well. Whatever it is now, you'll do well. Don't you doubt it. It's well to be ready for the worst and in the meantime, try to find a little mercy in it. Oh, mercy. A little time to prepare ourselves. I'm sorry, Aunt Hannah. You're quite right. For whatever it may be. MARY: Whatever is, it's already over and done with. Either he was badly hurt, but he lived, or he was so terribly hurt that he'll die. Or he was already gone when the man called and he just couldn't bear to be the one to tell me. One or the other. Or the other. Aunt Hannah, could we kneel down for a minute? Whatever is, is. No amount of guessing or hoping or wishing or praying is going to change it one iota. You know that. Don't you? In the name of the Father, the Son... O, Lord, strengthen me... ( both praying indistinctly ) BOTH: Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. ( Andrew sobs ) ANDREW: Mary! He's dead, isn't he, Andrew? He was dead when you got there. He was killed. Instantly. ( sobbing ) ( Mary gasps ) I've got to sit down. Let Papa know and Mama. I promised. I'll go. Miss Follet, I wish it had been me. ( door opens then closes ) I think I'd like just a little whiskey. Now, Andrew, I wanna hear all about it. Wouldn't you rather wait? Now! He didn't suffer? Instantly, you say? I saw him, Mary. There was only one small mark on his body. Right at the exact point of his chin. A small bruise. That's all. It wasn't even swollen. That's all? The doctor said it was concussion of the brain. It was instantaneous. He lost control of his car and went over an embankment. He couldn't have suffered, Mary. I saw his face. He just looked startled and resolute, and mad as hell. There was not one trace of fear or pain. There wouldn't have been any fear anyway. I saw him stripped at the undertaker's. It was just that small bruise. He had the most magnificent physique I have ever seen on a human being. Andrew? No, I have to know. Here. Take this. I wanna pour my own. As strong as I can stand it. Drink it slowly. You're not used to it. ( gasps ) All I can say is that when my time comes, I only hope I can die half as well. Give me his strength. That's how he was taken. Singing, probably. Happy. All alone. Racing home because he loved so to go fast and he couldn't, except-- Except when he was alone. And because he didn't want to disappoint his family. That's how he'd look death itself in the face. That's how he did. Gain his strength. Those are the words that are gonna be put on his gravestone, Andrew. ( Hannah speaking indistinctly ) HANNAH: The one whose father was killed in the war at Sharpsburg? PAPA: Do you want us to go home, Mary? MARY: No, Papa. PAPA: We need to keep out of the way. MARY: With Mama here, it's very hard to talk. ANDREW: I wanna speak long distance, please. Hello? Long distance? I wanna make a call to Ralph Follet in LaFollette, Tennessee. I wanna talk to you alone a minute. ANDREW: Have you got that? Thank you. I said, thank you. Excuse us a minute. ANDREW: Ralph Follet. F-O-L... No, central. F. As in &quot;father.&quot; F-O. Have you got that? L-L-E-T. No, I haven't. Will you ring me as soon as you get him? ( phone ringing ) Ralph isn't to bury Jay! No matter what, I won't have that. You tell him--! Don't hurt his feelings, but I mean it. Hello? Ralph? This is Andrew Lynch. ( sobbing ) Something I've got to tell you. You remember what Cousin Patty was like? When she lost her husband you were maybe 5 or 6. Well, she ran around like a chicken with its head cut off. &quot;Why did it have to be me?&quot; Batting her head against the furniture, trying to stab herself with her scissors, yelling like a stuck pig. You could hear her in the next block. You needn't worry. I don't because you're no fool. But you'd better, and that's what I want to warn you about. It's bad enough right now, but when it really sinks in, it'll be any amount worse. You'll feel that it's more than you can bear. You'll have to go through with it alone because there isn't a thing on earth any of us can do to help, beyond blind animal sympathy. ( sobbing ) I imagine you're thinking about your religion. I am. Take the greatest possible care not to just crawl into it like a hole and hide in it. I'll take care. ( tender theme playing ) MARY: Jay, my dear. You're all right now, my darling. You're not troubled anymore, are you, my dearest? My dear one. Everything's gonna be all right. For me. And Rufus. And for the baby. Jay... stay with me. Don't leave me now. Just a minute more. RUFUS: Is that you, Papa? Oh. RUFUS: Papa? Go to sleep, darling. Go to sleep. Papa isn't here. Take off that cap. Papa! Papa! I have a cap! No, Aunt Hannah, let him. Where's Papa? Rufus, come here to Mama. Papa was on his way home last night and he-- He got... He had an accident. So God let him go to sleep and... And took him straight away with him to heaven. Like the rabbits? We thought it was gonna be Grandpa, but we were wrong. Do you see, Rufus? Do you understand? Now, you be a good boy and go and have your breakfast. Auntie Hannah's got it ready for you. Is Papa dead? Yes! ( sobbing ) Papa couldn't help it. What do you mean? Having an accident. God doesn't put you to sleep for that, does he? Rufus, it wasn't that kind of an accident. Didn't your mother just explain it to you? He had what they call a fatal accident. It was a concussion. After you've had your breakfast, you can go out and play. But don't go far. Aunt Hannah! Where is he? Where is Jay? Mary! I mean, where is he now? Nobody even told me. Where did they take him? Down to Robert's, Mary, over on Grand Avenue. Why, I just wanted to know where he was. ( door closes ) ( tender theme playing ) There you are, sir. I'd say you're right handsome. Now why don't you get your Henny Penny book and your coloring stuff? Pretty soon, it will be time to go. Go where? Didn't anybody tell you? What? Oh, dear. Now, um, this morning, very soon, we will all go down to Grandma and Grandpa Lynch's, and see your papa once more. And tell him goodbye. But I thought Mama said... I know, darling. I know he is. But... What you will see is... Your papa will seem very strange to you because he's so still. But that's just simply the way he's got to look. ( doorbell ringing ) HANNAH: Father Jackson. JACKSON: Miss Lynch? HANNAH: Come in, I'll tell my niece you're here. ( footsteps approaching ) Don't go away now. We'll be going very soon. It's Father Jackson from Chattanooga, Mary. I asked him to wait. ( soft theme playing ) That's my father's chair. Children must not stare at their elders. That is ill-bred. Hm? Say &quot;Sir,&quot; or &quot;I beg your pardon, Father.&quot; Sir. HANNAH: Will you come up, Father? Mary, this is Father. MARY: Oh, Father, I need help. You have my deepest sympathy. I want to know why. Can you tell me that? Why did he go? Perhaps if we pray-- MARY: Why did he go? He was good, Father! JACKSON: The Lord be with you. Let us pray... MARY: He was a good man. JACKSON &amp; HANNAH: O, almighty and merciful God... MARY: If God is fair and just, then how could he? Why did he do this? Please, tell me why! Stop hurting my mother! Stop hurting my mother! ( Mary sobbing ) Rufus! Rufus, don't go away now. ( tender theme playing ) But Mama? ( whispers ): I thought you said he was in heaven. Uh, this isn't Papa, really, Rufus. He is in heaven. His soul is. This is just the part of him that's left to us so that we will always remember what he looked like. God, bless us and help us all. God, help us to know thy will. Oh, God. ( organ playing soft music ) RALPH: I'm Ralph Follet, immediate family. Also in the profession. ( congregation whispering indistinctly ) WOMAN: He was a wonderful man. Thank you. Thank you very much. I'm sorry, Mary. You're very kind. If there's anything I can do... Oh, no, there really is nothing. MAN: I can't believe it. RALPH: Walter? He raised me, his own brother, and then they-- They-- Don't even ask me to bury him. Now how does that look? Well, I-- I ask you. WOMAN: I was telling my husband, it'll be the first posthumous birth in the family since 1863. MAN: Rufus? You didn't think of me at all, did you? Didn't even think of me. He was my only brother. He was my only husband. ALL: Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and in the hour of our death. Amen. O, Lord, cherish and protect this innocent and orphaned child. Guard him in all temptations which life may bring. ( whispering ): Aunt Hannah. JACKSON: That when he comes to understand this thing, which in thy inscrutable wisdom, thou hast brought to pass, he may know and reverence thy will. God, we beseech thee. Let this boy, and the child who is yet unborn, may ever be the children which this good man would have desired them to be. Amen. ( melancholy theme playing ) Grandma says you've got to eat something. Rufus, in a day or so Mama will be feeling much better. And then I'll make up to you for not being with you these last few days, all right? Mama? Can I stay up here with you? Oh, Rufus, I'd like that, but mama really needs to be alone for a while. Please. Say, I-- I almost forgot. In my pocketbook, it's hanging on the hall rack, you look. There's a bottle cap I brought for you. Uh, Orange Crush? I expect that's a rare one. And, um, I found your crayons, and I put 'em on your dresser. And now, if you'll get into your everyday clothes, Aunt Hannah would love to take you to a picture show if we can find a good William S. Hart. All right? I guess I can't stay up here and hide forever. Can I? You've got too much spunk for that. &quot;That's not enough,&quot; Papa said. He said I'd need gumption. He said I owed it to Jay. Oh, there you are, old man. I was just going looking for you. Your Uncle Andrew wants to tell you something. I was just telling your grandfather here, we thought maybe... Well, we thought maybe you'd like to hear it too. Let's sit down, shall we? Rufus, I just want to say to you that... Well, when something happened today out at Greenwood. And if you'd been there, why, you-- You would've felt real good about it. Right when they began to lower your father into the ground, a cloud came over the sun. And it got all dark. And a great big white butterfly came and settled down on the coffin. And it just rested there. Just... barely making its wings breathe. Like a big heart. And it stayed there, Rufus. All the way down. Until it touched the bottom. And just when it did, the sun came out, dazzling bright. And he flew up out of that hole in the ground. And straight up into the sky. So high I couldn't even see him any more. Don't you think that's wonderful, Rufus? This is my daddy's chair. I want my daddy. I want my daddy! Papa! Papa! Papa! Papa! Rufus! No! Let him pick himself up. ( dramatic theme playing ) ( train horn blows ) Go away! Go away! I don't want you! I don't want you! I don't want you! I want Papa too, Rufus. But so did God. ( whimpers ) My, this is a n-- A nice place. I can see why you and Papa liked to come here. ( train engine chugging ) ( train whistle blowing ) Won't you come and sit with me? Please? Where's your cap? I don't like it anymore. And why not? It was such a nice cap. Because Aunt Hannah got it for me. Because I'm an orphan. Darling, you're not an orphan. I don't want you going around saying or thinking that you are, do you hear me? Because it isn't so! Orphans have not either a father or a mother, and-- And nobody to take care of them or love them, you see? That's why people give them things. But you have your mother. Do you see? Do you? Oh, and Rufus, I-- Don't you be sorry you're not an orphan. You be thankful. Orphans may sound lucky to you because they're far away and everybody's talking about them now, but they are very unhappy little children be-- Because they don't have-- Anybody to love them. Do you understand? Do you? ( sobbing ) ( tender theme playing ) Rufus, there's-- There's something I've got to tell you. Remember that surprise we talked about? Do you want to know what it's gonna be? What? A baby. You're going to have a baby sister. Or it may turn out to be a brother, but I dearly hope it will turn out to be a sister. Isn't that wonderful? Where is she now? I thought you said the surprise was in heaven. Is it still there? Oh. Oh, Jay. Help me. Here. Give me your hands. ( tender theme playing ) That's the baby. Right here. It won't always be inside Mama where it is now, warm and comfortable, but it will be born. And it-- It will be like some of Papa will be back with us again. ( laughing ) Oh, God bless my children. God bless both of them. RUFUS: Amen. ( laughs ) ( sniffling ) Oh. Come on, google eyes. Time to go home. ( tender theme playing )
