I sure am gonna miss New York, Louie. You too? Excuse me. Listen honey, your mom's been in a little accident and I'm supposed to take you to the hospital. Get lost lady. No seriously, I have a taxi waiting. We really should hurry. Do I look like a moron? Okay, I have two tickets to Disney Land. Would you like to see the Magic Kingdom? Help, help! - Call 911! - Excellent. She's my mom. You're scaring people Mom. Lou. Nobody else plays the stranger game. Oh come on, you love it. Maybe I did when I was little. No, you still do. Hey I told you to put him on a leash. Come on Louie. - Keep you on a leash now. - It's raining we gotta get in the cab before we get soaking wet. You're lucky you're getting out of this city, it's a death trap. Yeah Mom, I can't wait to go west where they shoot you from cars. Well at least you're a moving target. Mrs. Otis, you're an extremely paranoid woman. Oh Dr. Frugenfist, I'm extremely cautious woman with paranoid tendencies, ya? Save me, save me, she's makin' me leave New York. Come on, we're getting wet. So. It's not completely in the pits. No, it looks like a home. How late you think Dad will be this time? Oh, just the usual working late. Oh yeah you better put a leash on him. He's bound to think we're in Manhattan. - Yup. - And go off lookin' for Central Park. Yeah. Wait, no, no, no. Oops. Oops? Hi. You didn't miss me did you? Oh, you can tell? Come with me, come on. Dad! Sammy, oh buddy, it's good to see you. - How you doing? - I'm good Dad. And who's this guy? Lou, Lou. How are you Mr. Lou, good to see you. He hasn't forgotten your touch Dad. Oh he still loves me best. You know what we are going to be doing a lot of things together. Hey maybe we could drive around and see some stuff tomorrow? Well as soon as the job levels out we'll be doing a whole bunch of things together and the first thing I want to do, fix that up that tree house, what do you think? Looks pretty good huh? So I'll tell you what why don't you go in and find your room? Let's see. Go find your room, Mom and I... Want to make out. Where does he get that? What do you think? Wow. Can we really afford this? Well you know once your checks start rolling in. How did you find it? Oh Ellie turned me onto a really good real estate agent. And who's Ellie? Elanor Glassman's my boss. And you like her. And that's all. Hon, we are 3,000 miles away from all that crap. That crap can be bicoastal. Hey. I promise you. I know, just the last time... Well that's why they call it the last time. I found my room. Hey bud. Excellent, let's go find our room. Barbara? Hi, Joanna Otis. Hi Joanna Otis. I'd give you the welcome speech but we already know each other too well. I know, the beauty of email. We don't have to play catch up or lie or anything. I bet I even know how you like to take your coffee. Oh that would be great. I didn't have quite enough this morning. Well I'm gonna love working with you. We're gonna make a good time. You have all the right hotel experience, we're already friends... And Elanor Glassman is a very good client and wanted to make sure my husband would be happy. And you sure don't mince words. Well getting right to it I brought some fabric samples that I thought would be interesting for the upholstery in the lobby. Okay. What's Elanor like anyway, is she pretty? Not exactly. Ah, here it is. This one with this accent. These guys are practically indestructible. Hey, hey, that is your dinner. Hon, have you found my Bomber's mug yet? It's in here with the good silver. We have good silver? Yes. Ah, ta da. We gotta organized around here so. Okay just give me a minute I'm working on it. Uh huh, where's the sitter? Her mom said she'd be here at two, it is 1:57. Is she like a pro who plays Doom or is she just an amateur who blabs on the phone? She lives in the blue house down the street. Her mom was the one who brought the muffins the other day and... Punctual, I like that. Remember the numbers are by the phone - where we'll be alright? - Yes Dad. Okay, and honey don't be a brat. I may have to be using this girl a lot and from what I understand she's very sweet - and very low key. - And so boring huh? - Look maybe I... - We're going. I gotta surprise for you, go on. Enough surprises for one day. It's in the glove compartment. Is this a reward for leaving my son with Miss Megadeath? Yes. Actually you can call it an early anniversary present. - You like? - Oh my god. They're beautiful. Does everyone here work for you? Ah yes, the managing editor is king. Oh look at that. It's great. Hey isn't that your cover girl, the model? And my boss, that's Ellie. Oh hi. Come on, I'll introduce you. Welcome. Joanna I'm so glad to finally meet you. Oh thank you. Thank you for inviting us. Well, let's see how they look. Perfect. I told you they would be. And you were right. Yours are very lovely too. Oh mine are just a present to myself. Ellie I need you for a minute. Looks like I'm needed. - Very nice meeting you. - Likewise. Oh Paul you might want to go rescue John from your office. He's showing off your software and he doesn't got a clue. Uh huh, this way. So what'd you think of Ellie? The word flawless comes to mind. This is the office over here. - Go ahead. - Sorry, I'll be back alright. Could you give me a hand with this it's not working. What's going on? - It's frozen. - Yeah this happens sometimes. You look like you're having a good time. If I weren't so happy you'd see it from my face, I wouldn't be talking to you. Ah I guess you met Ellie? Not exactly pretty was not exactly an accurate description. You didn't seem ready for stunning. You got that. Oh well, might as well get fat. Thank you. So she gave me my big break when I designed this place and she featured me in the magazine. Can't you tell me something unattractive about her? She's been married three times. Glamor doesn't necessarily keep the love alive. - Mm-hmm. - I know that look. You've got a sitter and you have to call home. Again, the lines been busy ever since we got here. We're gonna be putting in some seriously long hours Joanna. You're gonna need more than a babysitter. I never have before. Darn. Is there a quiet phone some place? Try Ellie's office over there. Okay, be right back. Hey I'll call you back in five minutes. Is it alright if I use the phone? - Yeah. - Thank you. My babysitter has been on the phone for over an hour. She's probably talking to her boyfriend. I have a feeling she's going steady with Satan. - I can't believe this. - May I? Yes operator, yeah I'd like you to cut in on a line for me if you would please? It's an emergency. Name and number. Yes, Joanna Otis, 555-2670. Get your ass in gear man we're supposed to be serving dessert. Thank you. Yes this is Mrs. Otis. Yeah I've been trying to reach you for over an hour. The sitters breaking up with her boyfriend and he's in Hong Kong. Joanna do yourself a favor, call the home agency, get a nanny. I gotta find Paul. Sorry, sorry, sorry. Were all the moms on time? The housekeepers were on time. The moms were late. - And I'm the latest. - Yeah. Hey, you could've told me I had a roller in my head this morning. Yeah and go to school on crutches, smart. School, how was it? Dad has to teach me how to play soccer. Okay, why? I gotta learn by Monday. Okay, he has to help me unpack on Saturday so maybe Sunday morning. Oh yeah, we have to do the curtains... Mom you know what you need, a nanny. I work for Mr. Bill Gates' brother 13 months and then Robin Williams' sister-in-law three month. Not funny to work for. Well that's nice. Who are you related to? I leave by four, no windows, shopping but no coupons. Between 11 and 11:30 I watch Guiding Light and rest between two and four. I do not work for republicans. I do not eat with you, I am not your family and you are not my family. I call you Mrs. Otis and you call me Mrs. Wilson. Thank you Mrs. Wilson. So Margaret is there anything that you don't do? I can do anything you need Mrs. Otis. In the convent I even laid the tile. I have a machine and can do the mending if you like. I'm a good cook. I get a bit nervous with the bread but that's my goal this year. Alright, well I have a nine year old son, - do you have any experience... - And I raised six brothers. - Where's your boy? - He's right out back. The boy needs to learn the correct form. Head down, eye on the ball. You're gonna love your room Margaret. Oh and here's Louie. Oh. Hi baby, hi baby. I'm not gonna shave him. Well I guess it's back to the drawing board. Excuse me? Oh, hi. Remember me? Oh from the party. Charlie King Mrs. Otis. I didn't want to wake you so I just waited. I got your name from the home agency. I'm here about the job. The nanny? I'm a houseman. My last job was with a family in Palm Beach. Here's my letter of reference and Mrs. Powell's phone number. Oh I'm really just looking for somebody to drive my kid around and clean the house. I do that as well as simple plumbing and light gardening and heavy lifting. Why? Well as you would know running a household is an art form and I'm very good at it. Oh, are you married? You know what none of my business, sorry. No it's alright, maybe someday if I find a woman who appreciates what I do. Well Charlie the agency never mentioned you and frankly I don't know if I can afford it, I mean Palm Beach. Oh no no the salary is fine and since I never mentioned it to them you would've have to pay the fee. I never really thought about hiring a man. I know, but I don't... I don't smoke or drink or do drugs. I have a perfect driving record and I love kids. And you'd never even have to worry about changing a light bulb. Them. I'd need to discuss it with my husband and of course Sam has a say in the matter. Charlie King Mr. Otis. I saw you at the Glassman party. Hello. Charlie's applying for the house person job. You're kidding? You're not kidding? What do you call a guy nanny? Manny. Look why don't we talk about it and I could give you a call tomorrow? Unfortunately I'll be on a plane to Florida tomorrow. Why don't I show you how I work right now, please? Sure. Sam the man huh? You know what you look an awful lot like my favorite little brother. And why did he leave? Oh I'm sorry. Well thank you Mrs. Powell. Okay bye bye. They got divorced. She said he made a better wife than she did. I don't know. He still writes to the kids, they loved him. Yeah, it just seems kind of weird you know? Sam? - Yeah kind of weird. - Yeah. I call first dibs. Wow. Do you play soccer? Hon, we're out of toothpaste. We're never out of anything anymore. Just check the cabinet. Good morning. - Morning. - Good morning. Oh please let me get that for you. Okay. Charlie I heard this scratching in the wall. Is it possible we have a pigeon's nest or something? Yeah, yeah it's probably just pigeons. Is salmon okay for dinner? Yeah. I'm picking up salmon at three and then we're off to practice soccer 'til 4:30. We got tryouts next week. They're rats. There's a rat nest in the wall, Charlie found it. Oh god I hate rats. I'll pick up a rat trap on the way home. That's okay, I'll do that. How was it? It's perfect, you're a genius buddy. Okay. Have a great day sweetie. Love you. Hey wait there. Come on I want one of those. - Oh have a good day buddy. - Thanks. Oh I put the stuff from your pockets on your bureau. Oh and Dad I just wanted to say I want to show you the stuff that Charlie bought me for my science project tonight. A side of dead rat. Paul don't. I just don't like a stranger going through my pockets. He lives with us, he's not a stranger. He's been here a week and he's going through my pockets. I mean I don't know where anything is and neither do you. Everything's exactly where it's supposed to be. All you have to do is look. Oh terrific. We gotta call somebody, or is he an exterminator too? Pass it here, over here. Oh hey. Nice block Sam. Hi. Come here for a second alright? Come on guys. Really good work today. When does this end? It's over. Oh damn traffic. Which one's yours? This guy right here. Oh so you're Sam's dad. I'm Susan Copeland, Jason's mom. Hi Susan, Paul Otis. Dad I made it to first string goalie. Right away, just like he thought. Way to go buddy. I'm so happy. If I had a personal trainer I would be first string too. Butt head, turkey butt head. - Great save wasn't it? - Great, spectacular. Hey can I work out with you guys next week? Sure. Hey you know what, Mom is working late, what do you say we get a couple of victory burgers? I'll see you guys back at the house. No don't go. Dad no more burgers I need to train now. How about sushi? I don't know too many sushi restaurants around here. Charlie does. You need to tell me how I messed up on that first save you know? Sam you and your dad should go ahead and... Go ahead. So how did I mess up on it? Okay when he came around the inside. Okay I get it. Alright, that's that one. Don't let them move around to much up there got it? Got it. So this waiver says when the brainstem is severed by a renegade skateboard it's not their fault? Basically. Great. Sam do not let Charlie out of your sight. If anything happens to him I'm coming after you. Don't worry, I've got to do some planning sketches for the Halloween party, I'll watch him like a hawk. Mom go to work. Okay, play safe. Okay buddy, let's see what you got. - Have fun. - Okay. ♪ I can hear you ♪ ♪ Tell before you call me ♪ Ow. Dork. ♪ I've got John Carver ♪ ♪ Don't worry ♪ ♪ When you need me I say yeah ♪ Ah sorry dude. Hey, you change for a dollar? You know what, I left my cigarettes out in the car.

Hey Ellie you think John can handle that Janis account? Oh behave Paul, no business talk. This is supposed to be a fun evening. Next time let's play them for diamonds. I might have to. I can't find one of my earrings. I know it's somewhere at home. I just can't remember where. Well, it'll turn up. I hope so. I can't wait to see what you and Barbara are gonna do with the Windward Joanna, it's such an amazing space. Their advertising budget must be huge. Does he ever stop? Doesn't know how. Give me a hand in the kitchen Paul? Yeah sure. Jeremy seems really sweet. I hate that he's leaving for that damn play. I mean part of me hopes that it closes in a week and then the other part of me hopes it's a smash. He needs his own success. Paul's always been the driven one in our family. You know I keep him at the office too much Joanna. - I apologize. - I'm used to it. Sam would like more of him but it's not who he is. - Why is the house so dark? - I don't know. - What is going on? - I don't know. - Maybe a bulb burned out. - No not with Mr. Perfect. Wow. Did you tell him to do this? No but... This is like Honolulu without Mai Tai. A gift to celebrate our one month anniversary, Charlie. Honey it really is a sweet gesture. It's totally out of line. Look, if you still don't feel good about him in six months I'll find somebody else okay? What's he gonna do on our six month anniversary, remodel the house? - Two, Three. - Okay. Try again, try. Everybody try and fill your bowl. Grab some candy that's it. Now fill your pockets, okay. Whoa Halloween treats. Ellie made them. Joanna you are blessed. The kids love him, he cooks, he cleans, no bad habits. He never takes a day off, he's our very own Cinderfella. He is kind of perfect. Found that other earring yet Jo? It'll turn up. Charlie got me these for the party. Ooh. That's okay, that's just my special surprise. Halloween rat and the best scream prize goes to the princess, yay. And the best costume prize okay? I can't be it 'cause I'm the host so best costume prize goes to Jason the werewolf. My last live in was a nightmare. Took things bit by bit, silverware, a wine glass. Said the cleaners lost my silk blouse. Okay, now let's go over here. Watch out. What the hell's he doing? I haven't even finished that yet. One, two, three. A ghost story. The pied piper from hell. Wave to your parent. Come on up everybody. So this gets you in touch with your inner peeping tom. You can bring up any floor. An individual location. Larry, our sex symbol. Huh, the restaurant's terrace camera's out again. Let's check it out. Oh. Coming out here to smoke dope. Surely that's why the camera's not working. That would explain it. I used to be afraid of heights too. Oh yeah. For our last anniversary Paul tried to take me to that restaurant at the top of Rockefeller Center. Oh, I've heard that's very romantic. Yeah well I was too afraid to go up there. So we ended up having champagne and hotdogs on the Staten Island ferry. That was romantic. My ex and I spent our last anniversary at the marriage counselor. A month later we split. Oh well, two weeks after our romantic dinner I got a letter saying that Paul had been having an affair with one of the women he worked with. It had been going on for a year. Or maybe it wasn't? No, she included a picture from one of their corporate weekends. Oh. I just don't know if I can trust him again. Trust, that'll just set you up for the big fall. Yeah. Okay. Hey did you know that Charlie speaks French? Cool. What is it? Sorry, don't mean to bother you, just wanted to tell you I found your earring Joanna. Oh my gosh that's great where was it? Just in back of your nightstand. Thank you, I wasn't worried. Could Charlie watch the rest of the movie with us Dad? Sammy this is our family time. - I'm gonna go get a drink. - Okay. Hey, didn't like the movie? Oh it's not in English. You could hand those to me. Dad says he loves me but I know who he loves more. Your mom right? No, Louie. No way. See that, it's called a jib. Can we start French lessons? Well, I'll be, you'll look at the words in French and I will tell you the story in English. - Is it scary? - Parts of it. It's about a boy your age who had nine brothers and sisters, but he knew in his heart that they weren't his real family. See he was a prince and he knew one day somebody would come and take him away. And then one day somebody did. His mom's rich cousin. He said he could take one of the boys to live with him and his mom. She cried but she wanted one of her kids to have a chance. Did he pick the prince? He made the boys lined up and he picked the three with the cleanest hands. And then he made them run a race. He ran so fast he thought his heart would burst. But he won. So he went with the cousin to live in a castle. A place called East Hampton. Where are we? He was given everything he ever wanted. The cousin ignored him. Until one day when he took him to his boat... Was it like that one? And he gave him a pair of bright red boat shoes - and he let him steer. - Cool. And then he took him downstairs to a cabin and he hurt the prince. And the boy he cried. He said, "let me go home," and the cousin said, "you never can, "and if you ever tell..." I don't want to hear anymore. Sam the man it is a happy ending. What happened? Later the bad cousin, he had an accident and drowned. And the prince well he found a perfect home and a perfect family. I bet he never let anyone hurt him again. You can take that to the bank. Morning. Hon, why did you let me oversleep? You got in so late again. I am not having an affair. Of course you're not. - I gotta go. - Okay. - Have a good one. - Yeah you too. Oh for god's sake. Hey! Come here. I do not want you on that board without your helmet and your gear, do you understand me? - You understand me? - Yeah. Okay. Have you done your chores, have you fed the dog? I couldn't find him. What do you mean you couldn't find him, is he missing? Oh no, he's around here somewhere. Is he missing? It's not my fault Dad. We'll find him and I'll give you a call at work. I'm not going anywhere, come on. People sell dogs to laboratories you know? Let's split up so we can cover more ground. I'll go with you. Louie! You look for him in the area in our backyard. - I'm gonna check over here. - Louie! Louie! Louie! Here boy, come on Louie. - Louie, here boy! - Louie! - Louie! - Louie! I wish I was the one who was lost. Louie! - Louie! - Louie! Come on buddy. Lou. Louie, hey buddy. Hey buddy how are you? How are you boy? - Hey boy. - How are you? Where you been Louie? - Okay Sammy take him home. - Okay, come on Lou. - We'll see you. - Let's go. Come on Lou. Come on. Louie didn't get lost, you set this up didn't you? Well why would I do something like that? I don't know, I'd lay money on it. Hey, how do I get to Market Street? - Two blocks straight down. - Thanks. Hey, what's with you? That guy probably has dead kids in his freezer. I never talk to people I don't know. Come on. Mom trained me not to by playing the stranger game. Well how do you play? Okay. Say this chick walks up, hey do you want to go to a party? Hey, sure man. The party's in the car trunk and so are you after she steals your money and cuts your throat. Oh, okay. Try me again. Say a super babe, great bod, in a bikini waving tickets. Hey, dude you like basketball. Get lost babe! Yes, she's gone and you're safe. No, no, no, she's safe. I'm the murderer. You're the stranger. Hitch a ride little boy? I don't have my helmet and you know... Ah yeah yeah, Dad. You sure? Be our secret. - Alright. - Okay. You ready? Hang on. Okay here we go. That's it, steady. Good man, there you go, you're doing it buddy. Who needs a helmet huh? John, I missed the meeting today. Now why didn't you tell me the restaurant had changed? 'Cause I left a message with your house man. This is very cool. It's an anniversary present for my husband. I love your earrings. Oh thank you. Special face don't you think? I like it a lot. I'm just not sure what Paul likes anymore. This is it Joanna. All it needs is an inscription. Something romantic. Okay, something romantic. Yeah, let me help you. We are timeless, all my love J. Aw. It's perfect, I'll take it. Do you really think he'll like it? Oh he'll love it, it's beautiful. Ooh, I love your earrings. Now what about my commission on that watch? I thought this was it? Never insult that family. I didn't mean it that way. Now do what I said. - Hello? - Paul? Is Paul there? Who is this? Paul? Who was that? Just a hang up. What's he doing? Oh he said he was gonna plant tomatoes. I want to help. Go get changed. Hey they won't get any sun there. What are you doing? Nothing, just a little gardening. Oh god, oh I hate rats, yikes. And it looks like Alan will get the first down here on a conversion down near the 20. That'll make them first down and 20 in order to... Oh thank you. Charlie and the coach are in a big football pool. Hey honey why don't we let Charlie watch the game with us? Come on just this once? Now they're playing here for fourth quarter and it is getting louder here on the goals. Shoes on the furniture. Yours are so clean you could put them on the kitchen table. - Touchdown. - Yes, it's in the bag. Game's not over yet. Lou, come right here, come. Good boy. Good boy. Which one? That one. Yep, you're right. I told Joanna I'd have you home by 10. Could you explain the printer moved the deadline up again? My curfew has not been enforced lately. Everybody's a little nuts these days. Maybe it's the moon. At my house it's Charlie. I swear that guy's out to get me. You serious? You remember I missed that meeting last week? I think he set me up. I thought Joanna just forgot to give you the message. Joanna doesn't forget anything. The way things are at home right now I can't call her on it. Join the club pal. Jeremy used to call me every night. Now it's every other night. You woman are so suspicious. And we usually have every right to be. Then we find a way to forgive. But you never forget. We can't do this. Come on Lou, come on, come on, let's go. Oh nice. Go get it, go, go. Who was that at the door? Oh they're beautiful I love them. White is still your favorite I take it? Yes. - Thank you. - Happy anniversary. Let's go Louie. Let's do this. Lou go. Go get it Lou, go get it. Let's go. You can do it, go get it Lou. Come Lou, let's go Louie. You're dripping. Yeah I'm dripping all over you, okay I'll be back. Come on Louie, go for it. Go for it, let's go. Good job Lou, good job. Good job Louie. Okay. Shells on the sand and you in my heart, 'til Monday P. Oh come on, come on Lou. You, you almost got it. I know it's a mistake but how did it happen? Uh huh. Read it to me slowly. Thank you for my best years. Alright so how did I get this one? Maybe from the other flowers Mr. Otis sent. Thank you. I love my watch and you deserve more than flowers. Well you gave me diamonds remember? Was your card from the heart? Every word. Yeah John just make sure you take notes alright? This reception's important to Joanna. I want to be there for her. Okay good, bye. Oh man. Pleasure to meet you. Thank you very much for meeting me. Joanna this is Bill Fox of Fox Tours. Oh very nice to meet you. I've been wanting to meet you all night. I was hoping you could give me a tour of your model rooms. I would love to.

Well I suppose we could go to the zoo again. Oh the best part's coming up. After this second spray. Hey, did Charlie... It's my idea. Well we're definitely doing this again. Is everything okay at home? 'Cause if it's not you know you can always call me. At the office, it doesn't matter. I know you and Charlie are close. He takes really good care of me. Dad I miss you too. Oh buddy. Yes. Sam the man victorious again. Well then, you're so good at this. Makes me think you've forgotten these other things. You know squiggly lines on paper, what are they called. Oh I know books. I read a lot, I just don't like that one. Really The Prince, I loved it. Well I don't, it's creepy. It's about this kid who gets given away to this mean guy and he does bad things to him. Oh honey, what are you talking about? - That's not the story. - Yes it is. Charlie told it to me, he knows French. Sam. Has Charlie ever touched you? Mom, it's Charlie, he's not a perv. - Play again? - Yeah. I shall be victorious this time. It's right this way. Still no business cards Max? The number on the matches is the same. Take some. And let me clean those earrings for you Joanna. She'd love that Max. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm just tired. Thank you Max. Where are you? Talk to me. I miss him. Good, phase two. Phase one you hate him, phase two you miss him, phase three you find someone new. At least the rest of your life's under control. No it isn't. Charlie's not leaving? He's changed Barbara. He's not who he thought I was. Thank god Paul's taking Sam camping this weekend. I can give you a very good price on a diamond to replace that CZ. What do you mean? You didn't know? One of the studs is a VS1 diamond. The other is a CZ, cubic zirconia. Paul wouldn't buy a fake. Mrs. Powell this is Joanna Otis. If you remember I called you about a reference for Charlie King. Oh. Oh that's wonderful. Yes thank you. The Powells reconciled. Charlie King has been working for them in Palm Beach for the past two months. Barbara who is this guy in my house with my child? Hey Charlie you said you'd come play with us. Yeah I'll be there in a minute. Ha, aces at five. Hey. - Hey, what's this? - I don't know, take it down. Whoa. - It's Charlie's stash. - Party. Whoa, that's strong. Sweet. Here. No you gotta puff harder dork-o. - Dude. - Oh shoot, shoot, shoot. Get the water. Shoot, shoot, shoot. Charlie help, Charlie! Charlie help! Shut up, shut up, shut up. Charlie. Go, come on, go, go, go. Hurry up. Wait 'til I get down Jason. - No, no, go. - Jason wait. It won't hold us both. It's burning, let's go. We have to get ourselves down. Whoa. Help, please help! Ow, ow, ow, ow. Ow, ow. - Sam. - Hold on, hold on. Dude I'm so sorry. If they find anything wrong it's on your head Joanna. Sam I want you to go up to your room. I need to talk to Charlie for a minute. I want you out. I just ran inside for a minute, it wasn't my fault. Charlie King has been working in Palm Beach for the past two months. I can explain that. Who the hell are you? All this, this is me. This house, this home, it's all me. Do you have any idea how much all this cost? About as much as a half carat diamond. I want you out! You said you loved me. You're a liar and a thief. Yeah well let me tell you what you are, you're a lousy mother and a rotten wife and you and your phony husband don't deserve a kid like Sam. I'm calling the police. No way. I haven't hurt you, yet. Get out. I don't want you here alone. Now if the alarm system can't be installed until Monday Sam and I can go camping next weekend. No Paul he's really been looking forward to this and it's okay, I can stay at Barbara's tomorrow night. Then let me stay just tonight. We'll get up at dawn, we'll miss all the traffic. Alright, just tonight. Would you get Lou? Go get him. Hey. Hey there you are. Bye Mom. - Have fun baby. - Thanks. Come on Lou. - Up you go buddy. - Up you go. Good dog. That a boy, careful now. Good boy. Didn't want to lose that. Got you. You have two new messages. Hey it's Barbara. I'm just running out to get the video, see you later. Oh and I came by to get that tree. It wasn't on the porch. Do you think someone took it or did you just forget? See you later. ♪ Just long before you saw me ♪ Oh my god. You're positive this guy's responsible. - Yes. - Any sign of break in? No. Did you change your locks? I'm having a security system installed but they wouldn't come on the weekend. Did he ever threaten your son? No, and Sam doesn't know anything about this. Without proof we can't do a thing. Look, well here's the cut off timer our mechanic found under my husband's car. He could've been killed. But he wasn't. Your guy got his revenge. His type usually moves on. And that's it, there's nothing you guys can do? Mrs. Otis don't be too hard on yourself. If you're a working mother you have to trust your kids to strangers. It's a risk. It's up to you to protect your family. Hey little boy. Jeez Charlie, you into scaring kids these days? Only the ones I love. - What are you doing here? - I'm going away Sam. - When? - Tomorrow. Will you come with me to say goodbye to your mom together? Oh she's pretty mad huh? No we had a big talk, she's not mad anymore. She even said I could come back. Yeah she does get over things pretty quickly even with Dad. Hey, she sent me to pick you up. Hey Charlie. Hey dude. Can you give this note to your mom? I'm taking Sam with me and my car's on the other side of the parking lot. I want to go with you guys. Well I'm just taking Sam to his mom's office so I'd love to take you. Jason! See you Sam. - See ya. - I missed you Charlie. Hey you're wearing your special shoes today, how come? Well today's a special day. A very, very special day. Two cheeseburgers, two french fries, two onion rings and two chocolate shakes. Oink oink. Sam the man, I sure missed you. - So where are you going? - Mexico, you want to come? I don't know if my mom would let me. What if she came too? No way, she hates tacos. So where'd you get the car? My friend Lisa. Must be a good friend. Yeah, she didn't need it anymore. Hey when we get down to Mexico I'll be your new dad. That's not funny. Then I'll be your brother. Cut it out. Cut what out? - I mean who's your best friend? - Jason. What am I you little punk, the hired help? I want to go home now. I'd never hurt you. You know why? Because we're family. I gotta go to the bathroom. - You gotta hold it. - I can't wait. Okay. We can gas up for the trip. Hey. - I'll be watching. - I gotta get the key. I'm being kidnapped, call the cops. - Huh? - Give me the key. He's got a gun. Got a carton of these? No English. Move it. Sam. Open it! The back door. Hey there little boy. I gotta puppy in the car. Now you will notice on page two that our monthly profit has remained stable for the last seven months... I'm sorry sir, you have an urgent call, it's your wife. Excuse me. Hon I'm in a meeting. Paul it's Sam. Charlie's taken Sam. Jason said they were going to my office. I'm on my way there now. Don't you go into that building until I get there. I'm on my way. I've gotta leave, Sam's in trouble. Sorry. One of the little buggers just bit my toe. Did you see that? Hey. Answer me. Yes I saw that. He's here. Don't worry I can talk to him, hurry. Sam! Sam! Going up? If my son's hurt? It's just a game Joey. It's like the stranger game only real. Please, please just let me get Sam. He's in no danger for a while. What do you mean for a while? Well you saw the dress rehearsal. Sam loves you. He cares about you, I did too. It doesn't have to be like this. How could it be, hmm? Happy family? Could you love me? Show me. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. Your son is dead! Sam! Are you hurt? I heard a shot. - I thought you... - No. No honey, I'm okay. I'm okay. Listen, Dad's coming. Oh, he's gonna take us home. I am never letting you out of my sight again. Mom I have to go to college. Oh. Peekaboo. You're a pretty good shot Joey. - Paul? - You shot him for me. He wasn't a very good father Sam. I'm gonna do a much better job. Come on. You know Sam and I, we were thinking about Mexico, but I hear you don't like Tacos. You know what Sam, your mom, she had her chance. She blew it. Say goodbye Joanna. I love you. The stairs, run. Get out. Mom, Mom! Oh yeah, good idea. You'll get it right into your face, but I love you so much I'm gonna nail you right through the heart. Mom, Mom! Don't let him see me die. When you say things like that it just makes me love you even more. This will be our moment. Go, go. Help me. You're gonna have a great time with Auntie Barbara aren't you Lou, yes. Yes we're gonna eat liver and we're gonna watch lots of movies. Yes. What you don't like Lassie? How about Benji? When we get back he's gonna be spoiled rotten. So much spoiling, I can't wait to do it. Hey Lou, hey, Lou's a good boy. Can't we bring Lou with us? Come on let's get four little skies and we'll strap them to his paws and he can ski with us. No handsome, no. Hey, has Sam packed? Yeah, he's just picking out skateboard magazines for the ride. Lou, we are gonna go for one last play. Come on buddy, let's go, here we go. Come on buddy. - You two good? - Yeah really good. It's amazing how going through something so terrible can actually bring two people closer together. Hey that reminds me, I wanted to show you something. Remember that lady cop I told you about? She went through the files at the home agency and she found this. Does he look familiar? I think I know this guy. Yeah this is the waiter who ruined my dress at Ellie's party. After you left he dumped a glass of red wine into my lap. I was crazy. So was he. Someone had just stolen his backpack. His whole life was in it, phone numbers, license... And a reference letter from Palm Beach. This is the real Charlie King. They never found our Charlie. Apparently the current's really strong. To happier days. I will drink to that. - Alright we're going skiing. - Yeah.
