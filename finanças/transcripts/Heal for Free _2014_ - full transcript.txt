(Steve Kroschel) Lightning, the Northern Lights, the Moon and every force of nature gifts the surface of the Earth with energy. Mankind has had a sense of this all the way back to the Stone Age. I live in the Alaskan wilderness and recently learned of this powerful energy myself. (Howard Straus) He has made one of the most significant health discoveries of all time. One man re-discovered this secret that was to change my hometown forever. A grounding rod and a wire is all it took, to personally test whether this was too good to be true. And if anyone takes off their shoes and connects to the Earth, a profound change takes place, immediately. Everything's all interconnected. Anecdotal evidence doesn't prove anything. They call it 'Earthing' or 'Grounding.' Scientific testing occurs all over the world. And what happens to our blood cells is just the beginning. Earthing has the profound power to enable our bodies to become resilient to toxic food we eat, air we breathe and water we drink. Even electrical pollution can lose its damaging sting, if we are grounded. Physicists and medical doctors studied the stream of data and scratched their heads in amazement. (Rocky) I can say it's the everyday Joe that's gonna need this more than the guy that's got millions of dollars. (Steve) How much money do you have? Zilch. (Steve) Has your back gotten better? I have absolutely no pain in my back, whatsoever. ...and now long term, I don't have pain, at all, anymore. ...and I noticed that I was sleeping better, I had a deeper sleep... ...I used to not be able to just reach up. It transformed how local hotel operators did business - but then came the skeptics. (Young Woman) We understand you have created a website I can't say I've heard anyone say they had a health benefit. (Dave Olerud) I walked 30 feet today! (Dr. James Ochsman) Penicillin was a revolution in medicine. This is a revolution in healthcare that transcends penicillin. The Earth knew what the patients needed! (Taxi Driver) What are you here for? Business? Or Pleasure? Oh, a little bit of both. I'm here to get together with some fellow colleagues of mine who are passionate about Earthing. It's hard to believe, isn't it? ...to help them be heart-healthy... ...it's just uncanny how fast people heal. One of the most sensitive indicators of changes in the Earth's field environment is the human heart. Top medical experts from around the world banded together to further the scientific research, in an effort to revolutionize healthcare and save the environment in the process. (Man) Why's everybody barefeet? (Steve) Why is everybody barefoot? Yes. (Dr. Stephen Sinatra) Well, do you want to answer that one? (David Suzuki) We need to be connected with the Earth, which gave us birth! (Martin Zucker) It's such a simple and so profound and powerful concept - and it's right there, beneath our feet. (Clint Ober) If there is a message, at all about Earthing, it really is about our connection with nature, with the planet, with the universe. Scientists can now see forms of this energy in the laboratory. Earth's vibrational power can re-arrange grains of sand, which suggests nothing in nature is random. The world's greatest heroes are oftentimes visionaries - and for one Apollo Astronaut, he was determined to learn more, when he showed up at my doorstep. (Edgar Mitchell) Is this a wire that's connecting it? (Dr. Christy Garner) Yeah. it's a wire,and there's a mesh. And it becomes really distinct over time. This poor little sunflower that's not connected starts to wither and wilt. And the one that's connected to the Earth is still vibrant and strong. It seems to me, when I look at this, that the Earth, itself has this energy to give every living creature. (Edgar Mitchell) Well, it certainly would suggest that - certainly would suggest that. (TV Newscaster) An Alaskan filmmaker is shooting a documentary, right here, in Upstate. It's about a concept even the filmmaker says is too good to be true. Have you ever heard of grounding? It's a healing concept, filmmaker Steve Kroschel believes can change the world. This will be part of the sequel to Steve's documentary, 'Grounded,' the documentary that was panned by critics who were skeptical. Steve says he's out to prove these critics wrong. (Taxi Driver) So, y'all are you in town, visiting? (Dr. Stephen Sinatra) We're here to shoot this movie and basically to tell the world about the medicinal benefits, which are absolutely huge. All of my life, I've worked with wild animals, many of them orphaned and in the course of this activity, I became a documentary filmmaker, that tried to reveal truths about many animals that were long misunderstood. One of them was the wolverine. What scientists once thought about this animal's physical characteristics and personality has changed profoundly over time and on this given day, a BBC film crew was shooting a segment with me, furthering that enlightenment. They are not vicious, cold-blooded killers. They are, instead, highly intelligent and playful creatures that prefer to live as far away from modern civilization's mess, as possible. The film crew was shooting a cutting-edge documentary, called 'Beyond Human' and utilized my cabin as a home base. The wolverine's extremely refined sense of smell is what they wanted to highlight. Their olfactory ability is exceedingly beyond human. And we've barely scratched the surface, with understanding what animals detect, in their shrinking world. As humans, most of us have now lost our connection to nature and now there is a word for it, NDD - Nature Deficit Disorder - and this incompleteness has taken a severe toll on our mental and physical wellbeing. And this is where the story turns a page. I had a visitor, who was from a different world. Yet, he was lucky. He was lucky, because his father is a medical doctor, a heart specialist, who could see something most of us could not. And because I had this visitor, another guest arrived, straight from California, who is the host of a radio show about human health. His name is Howard Straus. This is the guy who had Clint Ober, the re-discoverer of Earthing or Grounding, on his health broadcast, a couple of years ago, that I had listened to. And because of that radio show, it changed my life - and my hometown of Haines, Alaska, for good. He was here to do an on-location interview with my visitor, Step Sinatra, the son of cardiologist Dr. Stephen Sinatra. I knew the interview would be challenging from the start, because Step was starved for nature - and didn't want to be in any one spot very long. I admit it was nice to have some help with the firewood. Both of them were eager to have contact with the orphaned animals, including Angelika, the moose, who wasn't feeling very good the past few days. They brought over some organic carrots, to make friends with her. It was time for breakfast - and what was on the menu was a prescription. A prescription straight from the pages of a book, written by Dr. Max Gerson; an MD that succeeded in curing cancer, almost a hundred years ago, with a famous cancer therapy or, rather, infamous cancer therapy depending on one's point of view since the trick to it's success is not drugs but basically diet, which emphasizes juicing organic vegetables in a special way. Howard Straus is Gerson's grandson. I knew that Step Sinatra liked to connect to the Earth, with his bare feet, as much as possible and so do I, for that matter. Years ago, I realized that by this time, no sane grizzly wanted to be, dare I say, barefoot in November. And the only option was to go into the Earth, where it was warm and comfortable. I fashioned an open ended culvert into a den as well for humans, that is. It is here, that Howard was able to continue his on location interview, for his radio show, 'The Power of Natural Healing.' (Howard Straus) You have attributed Earthing to saving your life. (Step Sinatra) It kind of goes along with my new philosophy, now, after everything that I've been through, that nature has a cure for everything. God talked to me. It was incredible. And God said something so simple, yet it was profound, and He said, 'Do you want to be here?' By be here, you mean, On Earth and alive. Yes. Exactly. I lived such a complex life, I chased after a lot of material type things and like I said before, that was not the answer. It got me to the wrong place. So now, I'm gravitating back towards nature; towards the laws of nature, towards the principles of Ayurvedic medicine, where nature is your healer and your teacher. Like I said before, nature has a cure for everything and that's what I learned, going through my entire healing journey. And I had spent hundreds of thousands of dollars, trying to see every specialist that was out there, clinic or therapy, or whatever it was because I had the resources. And all those led me to nothing. Still ill health. And really, the journey is that I had to go deep. I had to go within myself and realize that the healing is from above. As above, so below is from the spiritual aspect and I'm going to say God, and that's it. Whatever everybody else may think that may be, it's all personal but there's an intelligence that is beyond us and connecting with that; feeling that love, that's healing and that is nature. Step Sinatra defines his previous life as one where the bottom line was all that mattered. He worked as a Wall Street trader, but eventually also traded in his health, inadvertently. But perhaps his illness ultimately became his greatest gift. When his father, Cardiologist Stephen Sinatra started a desperate search with Step for the cause of his lost health; he discovered a few key factors. The two main ones were that his diet lacked proper nutrition and he walked around with cellphones; sometimes one on each ear, day in and day out. Many people are sensitive to electromagnetic frequencies. For these people, devices that label the word Smart as part of the product ID are anything but that. But Step's recovery did more than give him back his life. He had an epiphany and it opened his heart and his mind. (Step) OK, so I'm in the hospital and the main doctor walks in and eight other doctors, in white coats surround my hospital bed. Ten minutes before that, I'd almost choked to death because I was so weak, I was 83 pounds, I could hardly breathe. The doctor says, telling all the other doctors, he goes, 'This young man has a 1% chance of living through the night.' - One percent chance? - Yes. And my family's in the room, they're crying and I said to myself, at that moment, I go, Oh, my gosh! This was my worst fear. I can't believe I created this! Because it was like I was in a movie and I realized that I had created my worst fear. So, the epiphany was this, a split second after that, I said, Wow, well, if I created that, then I can create my wildest dreams. There was a time, not too long ago that I wanted to see, with my own eyes, the documented proof of his past and it took me right to the doorstep of his mother, Susie. I was then led to reunite with Dr. Laura Koniver, to independently evaluate his health profile. Step's health deterioration, at society's current disregard for basic biological laws is not unique. In fact some experts say that the majority of us are now caught up in some kind of health crisis, that is linked to environmental factors, whether we realize it, or not. To live a healthy life, does not mean one has to deprive themselves of tasty food and drink. And before Step and Howard left my cabin, we all experienced that fact. It's just that the wine should be made from grapes that aren't heavy laden with pesticides and chemicals and the same goes, all the way down the line, from the turkey to the potatoes. But if our diet is less than optimal, inflammation of the body can be a consequence. And yet, Earthing or Grounding can still help put out the fire. Surely, there must be a lot of people who stay at the Eagle's Nest Motel that don't eat right, yet something is going on with them; because now, ALL the rooms at the Eagle's Nest Motel are grounded because the public demanded it. Splitting firewood in the dark is asking for trouble but from personal experience, the difference of having a broken body for a day as opposed to a week rests in connecting to the Earth by way of a single wire, connected to a grounding rod in the Earth, under a pile of snow. I can only imagine what the implications are, if this if this ever catches on to what's possible. I recovered fast enough to follow Step Sinatra to Vancouver, where he was visiting his brother, Drew and his family. This was a place to gain a broader perspective. (Steve) So, what's he doing? Step's routine in the morning; it's his way of grounding; it's his way of centering. He does a load of the Chi Gong exercises, with his arms, you'll notice him doing that and it's his way of really building energy. It's building Chi, it's building sustenance. (Steve) And he's barefoot and he's grounded. He's barefoot and he's grounded. He loves it when he does it. If you ever try these particular exercises, you'll feel sort of vibrant; you'll almost feel this energy in your hands. Step and Drew Sinatra know where to go barefoot in the city. Sidewalks made of cement are conductive and are like walking on the Earth. Whereas asphalt, which is what city streets and most highways are made out of, has a chemical makeup which is nonconductive. Step was holding onto the water faucet while shaving, for a reason because the pipes and water line are grounded. Even taking a bath takes on a whole new perspective. When Step and Drew took me along to meet a patient at Drew's clinic, they introduced me to a meter they use, which, to my amazement, was able to read electromagnetic pollution emanating from power lines and cell phone towers, which clearly proved that it existed. (Drew's Patient) It was over a year ago, and I'd gone to see a girlfriend who was extremely sick and all those doctors couldn't diagnose her, so we took her for a walk in her wheelchair and we went over the overpass, into the park area and all of a sudden, I was like, Oh my God! You guys? Is it raining? Is it raining...knives? The noise.. (Drew) You were beneath the power lines. For me. Not everyone else felt that but for me, it was like, I've got to get out of here, because it hurt. It physically was hurting my skin. Because most of current society is bathed 24/7 in this electro smog, the best way to deal with this fact is through grounding and nutrition. In the case of this patient, she was receiving a vitamin cocktail, intravenously. Just outside Vancouver in Victoria, British Columbia, I met up with Step and Drew's father, Dr. Stephen Sinatra. Although he was using a cellphone, he was also barefoot at the same time, to counteract the effects. Dr. Sinatra was in Victoria to address the issues surrounding this subject. (Steve) Nice to meet you, Dr. Black! (Martin Black) Oh, good afternoon. And what are you going to be doing, today here? There will be a meeting, and a number of us will be discussing various aspects of the electromagnetic field pollution that's been pervading this country, and then, the world, the last few years. Well, most people don't believe that there's any danger. What do you say to that? Well, they don't believe that because they don't feel it but there are meters around that feel it, there are small animals around that feel it and they let you know by not surviving. Small animals? Even insects? Even insects. Can you give an example? There was a study I read, actually a few days ago and it was published in July in Greece, where somebody had the students raise fruit flies. Remember, fruit flies were the experimental animal, from whom we started to learn about chromosomes and genes; the very famous experiments, done in the Fly Room at Columbia University. Anyway, he did this, having the flies exposed to different kinds of gadgets, all the different gadgets that we have, maybe a dozen of them. And the fact of the matter is that it interfered with them and the eggs many of the eggs didn't survive. In fact, all of the exposed insect eggs were damaged, compared to the controls. So, you know, you don't have to ask the insects, they tell you by just not surviving. There are literally thousands of published independent studies, worldwide that warn of reproductive abnormalities and DNA damage. Even cell phone manufacturers have warnings but most people don't read the fine print that that comes with these personal gadgets. I do not own a phone for several reasons. One of which is that there is no reception where I live. And in making this documentary, it was becoming increasingly difficult to actually find a pay phone. They are disappearing fast. And so, society changes according to an economic plan, for better or for worse and history has shown us that hindsight is 20/20. Personally, I look at EMFs as a kind of soft kill. But necessary, I guess. No one is going to throw out these electronic gadgets, anymore than we're going to stop driving cars, because they burn poisons that obviously aren't healthy. Dr. David Suzuki gave me a better perspective. (Dr. David Suzuki) We have come to think that our bottom line, is determined by economics. Economics is a human created entity. It's not some magic force of nature, that suddenly comes upon us and we've got to bow down before it but we've created the economy as if it's some kind of thing, here that we're all here to service. The reality is, we have forgotten that we are biological creatures. (Steve) And you are an Electronics Engineer, is that right? - Yes. And you work in Silicon Valley? Yes. And I described to you what grounding is about and what did you think of that? I believe that we need to see data and if it is reproducible and if there is data to back it up... The only way that I'm able to leave Alaska for brief periods of time is because I can rely on one man, Rocky Seward. Rocky is another example of someone who's suffered from health issues that melted away because of Earthing. Now, I tested one of those meters in my cabin and was relieved to see that it read minus 65, which is the best reading one can have. The first documentary about Grounding, and how it helped the residents of my hometown, was having its first premiere. The only problem was, there was a snowstorm brewing. (Steve Kroschel) This town is unique. People in this place are interested in doing something adventurous. (Steve) Now, you're an electrician and some people say that Earthing makes you sick that if you go barefoot on the earth, that there could be stray voltage. And that it could make you sick. What do you say to that? No, the Earth is grounded, you're not grounded. You can't get sick from that. (Steve) All right, how long have you been an electrician? Fifty years. My company is Hertz Electric. And then there was Dave Olerud, who not only recovered the ability to walk again but recently had open heart surgery to repair a congenital heart defect. Two years ago, the doctors and his family feared that it would have killed him, right on the operating table. (Dave Olerud) Once you look at the evidence, there you see it? And this, if you notice, is where I plug myself in, every time I lay down. (Steve) What do the doctors say about this belt that you wear? (Dave Olerud) They were doctors. They didn't say anything positive or negative. Of course, I didn't plug myself in, when I was in the hospital. But, you know, I think they hear all kinds of stories. He said, if you conquered what you did, as a paraplegic, he said, you can conquer this, too. And I had a beautiful wife and family to help me... (Steve) The doctors were they surprised? The last time I went up there, we had a checkup and we went up last Fall, and the doctor evaluated me and he had nothing but a smile on his face. He said, That's a miracle. No matter where I looked, people were transformed. Take my associate, Mario Bonassi, who works with birds of prey. His life dramatically changed, which of course, also helped the snowy owl, indirectly. And what better way to celebrate, than to play Santa Claus, and deliver grounding resources to those that slipped on the ice or couldn't sleep or had a spouse that was desperate... the list of people runs off the page. When I stop and think about it, Mother Nature, in her vast silence, speaks volumes to me, sometimes. I see a beautiful energy, when one directly connects to her that makes a human being's spirit soar. And this soul shine seems to manifest itself in all life, everywhere. Children from all over the country began to write me, after hearing about how I would do tests, with cut sunflowers in vases and ground one and not the other. For this young girl, the results were worth a ribbon. And it wasn't long before this idea of grounding plants branched out in our community with an herb that fuels scorn, hatred, confusion but yet, hope for many. For one resident of Haines, Alaska, he wouldn't let frozen ground deter him from a test that he wanted to do with me. So, he stuck a grounding rod in a tree and then ran a wire into his little garden in the house. We wanted to verify the potted plants he selected for this trial were indeed grounded. And so, we tested the connection from the tree with a separate Ground from his water faucet. I stuck two flags in the potted plants that were grounded to see what would happen, over two weeks and three days. One of the plants, that was ungrounded, in the back, had a seven day head start. Surely, as they all grew together, their leaves started to touch each other, giving the entire garden a boost of power. Even so, running a ruler across the tops of the whole garden, verified the two grounded plants. Growing cannabis is legal in Alaska and I've personally seen its astounding medicinal effects on those sent home to die by allopathic medicine. It's the resin that does the trick, when ingested by the walking dead that gives them their life back. I've personally followed these miracles, through the work of Dr. Jeffrey Hergenrather, who demonstrates hope, health and life, everyday. Grounding is part of nature's recipe for keeping us truly alive. We need to be grounded now more than ever, because our present culture seems oblivious to basic biology. In favor of shortsighted, unsustainable economic gain. I find it absolutely amazing that virtually all indigenous people clearly understood how connecting to the Earth meant being truly alive. But presently, being grounded takes on a deeper significance. Countless studies have proven that a diet filled with genetically modified food is not good for humans and creates inflammation. Grounding can help significantly but if consumed in large amounts by a sensitive wild animal, a tipping point can be reached, for which nothing can be done. After Marge the moose died in late Fall, I discovered in research, that a pellet that I was feeding Angelika and Karen, as a supplement to wild browse contained genetically modified Corn. I was tempted to continue feeding it, till I looked into Karen's eyes. But it was already too late for Angelika. How could I have done this? Was it really the Genetically Modified food, called GMOs, or something else? I needed to be sure. It would take me all the way to New York City to listen to one of the world's foremost authorities and researchers on the subject, Jeffrey Smith. I entered a lecture he was giving on this agricultural nightmare. (Jeffrey Smith) RoundUp is now being sprayed on wheat, on barley, on rye, on potatoes, on citrus, on berries, as a ripening agent. So, if you're going to avoid GMOs, also switch to Organic, because Organic does not allow RoundUp. These are testicles that changed from pink to blue, in rats that were fed GM soy. If GMOs were causing these problems, why would we not see them? No one is looking. There's no postmarketing surveillance. I related the moose tragedy to Jeffrey for his insight. (Jeffrey Smith) We've seen a lot of evidence of livestock and wild animals, certainly avoiding GMOs when given a choice so, it would be interesting to try that experiment. But also, of getting better when taken off of GMOs. We've heard a cattle feed operation showed a lower death rate, when the GMO corn was removed. We've talked about, we've seen certain organ lesions in animals fed GMOs, whether in the farm or in the laboratory. It was at this point, that I started to introduce some good news, in the middle of all this bad news. This wasn't Haines, Alaska, anymore but I discovered quickly, that the people were no different. As fate would have it, the 'Grounded' movie that premiered in Haines was suddenly in the national spotlight, about to premiere in New York City. And Howard Straus was set to record another on-location radio segment for his health program. This time, he met with earthing advocate, Dr. Laura Koniver and her two children for a segment in Central Park. Dr. Koniver homeschools her two children and utilizes these types of travels for homeschool lessons. (Dr. Laura Koniver) earthing's one of the most ancient healing modalities of all time, so it's the easiest for more patients to align with. I've seen everything from weight loss, to pain reduction, to sleeping better. I've had patients, literally say that they have a tree that's on their balcony that they can touch the branch of but it's rooted in the ground below. They sit there on the balcony reading while touching that for ten minutes and it makes a difference in their life, so yeah. Dr. Koniver went from one radio program to another, with her message of healing. (Dr. Laura Koniver) All of your free radicals, any kind of inflammatory things that you've got, starting to built up, it's starting to wash it away, now. Before long, I had Howard helping me hand out crumpled paper bags of Earthing resources to these city folk. It was Déjà vu. While staying in the big city, I switched to a more civilized way to ground, even myself at night. But first, I needed to check the grounding port in a wall socket, to ensure the building was properly wired. Older buildings, before the 1970s, did not always have a good ground. For this reason, a grounding rod is often necessary. I was in luck. The wiring was updated in this old hotel. Now, the Earth's energy could flow into the conductive fibers of the pad, if my skin made contact. (Howard Straus) So, I had a conversation with Laura Koniver and she said that she did a little mini study with her obesity patients; that they were all women. 60% of them lost weight, as she expected. 40% of them did not. But those 40%, when she looked into it more deeply, had more serious ailments. And the more serious ailments DID clear so, in other words, the body took care of the most dangerous things first; the most life threatening things first, leaving the obesity for later. Howard was now recording Dr. Nicholas Gonzalez, who explains his experience with an Earthing resource. (Dr. Nicholas Gonzalez) The best way to describe about the way I felt is that, I felt extremely toxic and poisoned. I couldn't sleep at all. I felt irritable. I developed terrible itching. (Howard) First of all, I'm wondering what kind of welling do you live in? (Nicholas) I live in a pre-World War II apartment, so it's there are no synthetics in it. (Howard) Dr. Gonzalez, thank you for joining us. Howard, it's always great to see you and it's always great to talk with you and have stimulating discussions. It was the opening night of the theatrical release of 'The Grounded' documentary. Howard had yet another segment to record, for his radio program, with Step Sinatra's father, Cardiologist, Dr. Stephen Sinatra, in the projection room, in the theater. (Dr. Stephen Sinatra) I've interviewed hundreds of people who are grounded. Not everyone has a pleasant experience. I mean, first of all, people can have a detox reaction. Where they're earthing and they're getting that energy through the body and you know, this could activate parasites, maybe the live spirochete; activate microbes. But remember, even though they had an undesirable situation, like leg cramps; for example, remember this, that when you do Earth, when you do Ground, you could be detoxing the body. So, then you bring the body to a level, where it has to get a little bit worse, before it gets better. Even my assistant back home in Alaska, Rocky, was able to read the reactions from the film critics to 'The Grounded' documentary. It wasn't pretty. The New York Times didn't pull punches. While considering the film critic feedback, an acquaintance who advocates earthing and grounding to a broad audience, tried to cheer me up, with yet another published scientific, double blind study. Yet, all I wanted to do was go home. (Chain saw) (Steve) Hold that. Maybe take those things out of your ear, so you can hear me. Do you feel better, than you did 24 months ago, Rocky? Yes. Can you tell me what your last name is? Seward. Rocky Seward. Now, do you feel better? Are you richer than you were, 24 months ago? Nope. What do you mean, 'nope.' How much money do you got? Zilch. Not a dollar to my name. Well, you're rich in health now, right? Yep. You don't look very happy. Not financially, I'm not. Well, maybe I can change that. I'm going to go on a trip. OK. When are you coming back? I'm not sure yet. (Laughs) (Steve) You don't believe me, do you? There are people in New York that say they saw this movie and they thought it was a bunch of crap. Didn't believe it. What do you say to that? From experience, I know that it works. What? Experience, I know that it works, I had sleep apnea and I don't have any more. Well, what about other people in this town? There's quite a few people here that were sick and had back pain and such and they're all healed now. But would film critics on the West Coast see the documentary with a different perspective? (Howard) Welcome back folks, this is Howard Straus; 'The Power of Natural Healing,' the guest is Dr. Gaetan Chevalier. Dr. Chevalier works at... he is faculty at the California Institute for Human Studies. Now, California Institute for Human Studies. Human Science. California Institute for Human Science. Human Science. Thank you very much, Dr. Chevalier. Now here's a technology that is simple and basically free for anyone, and yet is one of the most powerful techniques for healing that has ever been identified. (Dr. Gaetan Chevalier) I started doing research for Earthing, with Clint Ober, in 2003, and it happened at the California Institute for Human Science and at the time, I was very skeptical. You were not an advocate. That's right. But connecting to the Ground is, to my surprise, amazing results, beyond what I expected, actually. The first study was an electrophysiology study. We measured brainwaves, muscle tension, heart rate, skin temperature and blood pulse, all these things. And we also measured the flow of energy, using a machine that has been developed by the founder of the CIHS; it's called an AMI. (Howard) This could have vast implications in the treatment of clinical depression, I would think. (Gaetan) Yes. People with depression, even people with Alzheimer's and also children with ADD. We have another study that is going on, right now, on blood pressure; how it changes. We're measuring blood pressure directly, so we're going to confirm this, I'm pretty sure. (Howard) If this technology, which is basically free can relieve pain better than any of the pharmaceuticals that are sold over the counter and that are this huge, multi, multibillion dollar industry, you can see that there would be a fair amount of commercial jealousy and/or competition going on. But I was not here to pat Dr. Chevalier on the back. I was here to play the Devil's Advocate to represent the film critics, who lambasted it all as snake oil and New Age nonsense. And I don't know if this guy is an expert in electricity. It doesn't sound like it! It doesn't. I'd like to see his credentials. This guy doesn't know what he's talking about and I can demonstrate that to you. (Howard) Now, remember, Dr. Chevalier used to teach electronics and electrical engineering students about electronics and electromagnetism. OK, so this person is saying, here, that alternating electric field, present in the environment, they are radiated from wires, even when there are no currents flowing through them. I can't even begin to imagine how they can come up with such a thing. Here it is. We have a wire that is just plugged in. Connected to nothing. Okay? And we're gonna demonstrate... (Beeping) -that it emits EMF. Okay? And this is not a particularly sensitive device. No. This is a device you can find commercially. They're very cheap. And there you go. They do emit EMF. So, I'm sorry, this person from Skeptoid does not know about electromagnetism. From California, I went to South Florida, where Step Sinatra's father, Dr. Stephen Sinatra was spending a relaxing morning with another doctor, who advocates natural healing, Dr. Joseph Mercola. (Dr. Joseph Mercola) We know that Vitamin D is just so crucial. The fine point, that I feel most people fail to appreciate, though, it's not simply swallowing a pill. Because I kind of think that's the allopathic approach, the allopathic paradigm, in that there's a pill for everything. Well, our ancestors never swallowed Vitamin D pills. They got it by exposing a significant portion of their skin to sun, in the non-winter months, unless you lived in a subtropical environment. As I listened, I thought about a man that has carried the torch for the Native communities, that always knew what nature could do, in giving one their life back; whether it was physical, mental or spiritual. (Dr. Stephen Sinatra) I met Clint about ten years ago. I was at a conference in California. And we were sort of in a trailer, looking at what we call (unintelligible) basically, endothelial cell dysfunction, using a blood pressure cuff, and I met this cowboy and basically, he's talking about Grounding. And as a cardiologist, I've got to tell you; I resonated with it, because the heart's an electrical organ. What Dr. Sinatra and Dr. Mercola find as outstanding healing modalities is exactly what saved Dr. Sinatra's son, Step from certain death. And I was there to be a witness. I see lots of cracks now in the brick wall that allopathic medicine has built to protect larger interests and because of suppressed information, many people go to their graves far too early. Dr. Koniver and I had lots to talk about concerning this and I was already late for that appointment. When it comes right down to it, most of what it takes to maintain your health is free, in the form of Grounding. All one needs is awareness. (Dr. Laura Koniver) We just have this! (Steve) What do we do in a place like this? Because this is what we live in; what do we do? Well, I think that there's a way for us to accept modern technology in our society, as it is and also, still make the time to touch Mother Earth and find ways to connect with Her, even with this all around us. I mean, we're still living on the Earth, so there's still ways to touch her, connect with her and I don't think it has to be that we live that way, constantly, I think it could be that we take the effort to do that every day even if we're not living directly off her. Her home schooling continued and now, I too was one of her students. (Laura) There's so much sacred geometry in the human body. Our human body is full of sacred geometry. So, in your ear, the way you pick up sound is through a sacred spiral that's right next to your brain. In the eye, first of all, the shape of the eye is what? (Son) A circle. (Laura) A circle, yes. So, here we have a sensory organ, your eye, that's designed to pick up on what you're seeing and the back is called the retina. There are rod and cone cells, there. And wait till you see what they look like, up close. See these? You see how some are pointy and some are like sticks? They're called that because of this, a rod and a cone. And if you were to look up close, look at what it really is. It's these discs. Stacked on each other. Beautifully and repetitively and with a geometry to them. (Daughter) Oh, my goodness! That's crazy! Yeah, that's the back of your retina and that's what picks up on light. Dr. Stephen Sinatra has never stopped his pioneering research into Earthing. Working closely with colleague Clint Ober, they continue to break down barriers in conventional medicine that separates patients from real recovery and freedom. And so, today, I was on hand to document a first time experiment, which, if it would work, would make history in medical circles but it if it failed, would leave Dr. Sinatra embarrassed at best and confused at worst. It was the introduction of Grounding to a diabetic patient whose retina would be photographed before and after only two hours of Grounding. If even the slightest change could be observed after that time, it would be groundbreaking news and unequivocal, as to what's possible, if Mother Earth is given a chance to be heard. Dr. Sinatra placed a grounding patch on the bottom of both the patient's feet and on both palms of his hands. The Earth would do the rest. You're grounded! (Steve) Doctor, how much more time do we have before we test this patient? About 20 minutes or so. OK. What are we going to see, hopefully? So, the purpose of this test and the reason why we do it, as retina specialists is called a fluorescein angiogram. Fluorescein is a vegetable based dye and we inject it into a patient's vein through an IV. And it circulates through the heart and up to the head and into the eye and we can actually document the blood flow in the eye, in the retina, in particular. So, the retina is the photographic film of the eye, it's no thicker than tissue paper and it's attached to the inner wall in the back of the eye and coursing through the retina are very fine blood vessels. And, so, say, for example, a patient with high blood pressure or diabetes or macular degeneration, we monitor the blood flow in the back of the eye by doing this test. (Dr. Stephen Sinatra) I've done like 3,000 angiograms, so I'm used to reading angiograms of the heart but when I see something like this, you see this branch coming off here and it's really lit up over here? And there's another branch here, (Dr. Shalesh Kaushal) Could that be a difference? (Stephen) Yeah, I mean, isn't that improved blood flow? (Shalesh) It could be, Steve, yeah. And even off this tributary, too. (Stephen) Yeah. You can't see it here but there's a beautiful tributary there. (Shalesh) Yeah, you're right. (Stephen) Yeah. Isn't that increased blood flow to the retina? (Shalesh) I was looking at, concentrating on the macula, because that's the gain in vision. The macula actually looks better profused, post Grounding. I would tell you that's pretty neat because usually when we see a distortion of the full field avascular zone like this in diabetics, it gets progressively larger. You never see it shrink. That's what caught my attention right away. (Stephen) And the fact that these vessels are lighting up more in other words, can you assume, if you do have better profusion of the retina, could there be, under microscopic conditions, a profusion of the macula? That's what I'm getting at! That's what I was saying; the change in the avascular zone or this shrinkage of it, suggests that there's improved profusion of the macula. That's really what this is about. - That's what we want. - That's the gain. Even if you have one percent profusion, that's significant. That is gigantic, for the photoreceptor cells that are affected by that. And that's only two hours of grounding! Less than two hours. I mean, suppose we did 12 hours of grounding? That would be interesting. (Steve) So, doctor, what does this mean for you? Will you do this with more patients? Absolutely. This is a very interesting initial observation and it's quite exciting because if we can show as in all good science that it's reproducible, and we can improve the profusion in this instance, of a diabetic patient and other patients that has huge implications to the health of their eye and actually, the health of their whole body. For the first time, there is even hope for this patient to regain his sight. Dr. Sinatra can also see significant differences between horses that are grounded. Then obvious Golden Ratio in nature is an emphasized home school lesson for Dr. Koniver's children because it ties in the subjects of mathematics and science and health and even social studies all into one, tight curl. It is the symbol of life, intelligence, unity, beauty and hope. The more I thought about it, our architecture, our corporate logos, our engineering feats, even our adventures into space was based upon this power of interconnectedness. Laura and her children were now at the home of Apollo 14 Astronaut Dr. Edgar Mitchell. Dr. Mitchell also sees the power that grounding can render and sees that power from a unique perspective. (Dr. Edgar Mitchell) I want to point out the hand controller. And this is the hand controller I used on Apollo 14. - Wow! - To land on the Moon. (Clara) How many interviews have you had in your life? (Edgar) I have no idea! But into the thousands, I'm sure. - I'm sure. There are few days, when I haven't been interviewed. - Wow That's crazy. Two years ago, Laura's daughter Clara, gifted Dr. Mitchell with grounding resources to improve his own health. So, in some ways, this was an update and a reunion. (Clara) What was the most surprising thing you learned from standing on the Moon? Well, I don't know that there were any great surprises, because we had practiced and trained; everything was a result of training. Setting up the science station, out in front, with a lot of equipment that we set up that then broadcast data back to Earth for 14 years. And yes, we have been visited by alien life forms and the evidence is overwhelming that the extraterrestrials have been coming here for perhaps centuries. In our lifetime, the famous Roswell Incident was the beginning of the Modern Era but the evidence is pretty strong and I know all of the- on a firstname basis have met- all of the primary investigators both in Europe, South America and the United States that are the experts in that area. Why the Powers that Be are covering it up or trying to keep it hidden- have tried to keep it hidden- but I suspect that it's power and control. Did what Edgar speak of have anything to do with Grounding? A century ago, if one suggested that Human would walk on the Moon, it would've been thought of as sheer lunacy. Yet, after several failed attempts, Edgar is only one of 12 people to ever walk upon the surface of an alien world. I see this as a metaphor for Earthing or Grounding and what is suggests is a new healthcare modality. Edgar embraces grounding wholeheartedly. Why? Is it based on something else that he knows? (Son) Do you see math equations in the universe? (Edgar) Well, I don't see them I mean, we know, we've created a lot of math equations to describe the movement in the universe and where things are, with respect to each other. (Alison Price) These are petrochemicals, formaldehyde, fragrance, toxic preservatives, just to name a few and there's also many that won't appear on a label, they're just byproducts of the manufacturing process, that are residues, that are going to be in that product, that will not appear on the label because it's not an official ingredient. In my opinion, it's like, why take the risk. I think innately, we know that these chemicals should not be present in our bloodstream. We're a living study. Right now, we don't know the health impacts about these toxic chemicals and how they interplay with one another and how our bodies are dealing with them. So, The sooner we understand that life is interconnected and cyclical and that our health is intricately tied to this planet, the better. We're excited about everything that going on and now without further ado; Doctor Laura. (Applause) (Dr. Laura Koniver) All right, thanks so much for coming, I appreciate it so much. So let me tell you a little bit about how I transitioned from living disconnected to the Earth and not knowing I was disconnected to really embracing how it feels to start Earthing and to making a conscious choice to Earth. I had my daughter. She's the one who taught me about earthing, really. Clara, sitting there, in the front, and she came into my life and changed me in a million ways but one of the ways is that she had colic. And that's a lifechanger, because she cried constantly. The only time she's not crying is when she was nursing, basically and pacing around and eventually, I start pacing outside. I lived in Arizona at the time, so I never wore shoes, because it's warm, year round. So, I'm pacing outside in the front yard with my little baby girl and every time I'd do this, she stops crying. Every time. So, finally, dawning on me, through sleep deprivation that this is the only way to get her to stop crying, so every day we'd go outside and I'd walk, sing to her and I'd walk, and she'd almost always goes to sleep or something and I'm thinking... what? And the I'd realize, sometimes, I'd have my shoes on and it wouldn't work. Right? Or, I'd go outside and my daughter would be crying in a fit and I'd have my shoes and like, why is this not working? it's not that, it's- I'm barefoot and she's on my skin, on my chest and her skin's touching my skin and I'm grounded to the earth and that's the difference. So, I didn't have a label for it but I knew, hey, whatever this is, this is really helping, instantaneously with pain. I'm stepping outside and I'm holding her and nobody's telling her 'You should be feeling better now.' Her autonomic nervous system is having an instant response to the fact that it's not inflamed anymore. Her body is neutralized and inflammation is decreasing and I can see that relief and I can feel it in her. So, that's how I started getting the concept of Earthing. All we have to do is touch it. And we're Grounded. We are providing the earthing resources to various cancer patients across the United States to help them with, hopefully, whatever it is that ails them the most. And the feedback that we've gotten has been pretty amazing. A lot of pain relief. We have patients who say that it's relieving their headaches. I've been seeing patients for 17 years, specializing in autoimmune diseases. Started using Earthing, Grounding. (Steve) OK, so approximately what percentage of your patients have a positive result with Grounding resources or being Grounded? Easily, 85% to 90%. Step Sinatra and his father are dedicated to updating healthcare. They believe it will improve the economy and open doors that up till now have been closed and locked. I was born near Hinckley, Minnesota and here is where both my parents have not only experienced the effects of grounding but have shared it with everyone that will listen. (Elsie) Oh, I'm looking at my pictures. Okey Doke. Here, we've got the hunting picture. (Steve) Elsie, how old are you? I just turned 98 the 17th of February. Have you lived close to nature your whole life? ALL my life. What did you do, in your life? I mean you picked berries? What? I did everything that an ordinary citizen does, in their lifetime. When my parents introduced Earthing to the neighbor girl, that survived being pinned by a tractor tire on her face, the results she had closed the door on anyone else's doubts within her family about what grounding can do. First it was her mother. And then it was her sister. I hadn't been in Minnesota for two years. And there were a few people missing. I knew where to find them. Did they die before their time? Probably so. It made me think deeply about what matters. Seeing my family name made me realize that I want to make every moment count, before it's gone forever. (Dr. Stephen Sinatra) We live in a toxic age. I mean there's toxicity all around us. There's seen forces, there's unseen forces and the unseen forces are worse than the seen. So, what we're doing, right now, we're taking in the energy of the Earth. We're balancing, we're connecting. That's it! We're connecting with the Earth. That's what we need that's what everybody needs. (Step Sinatra) That's what I really want. (Vanessa de la Vina) So, tell me a little bit about what you guys are working on. Well, we're going to go into a retirement home, and we're going to be giving these Grounding sheets. Which, I don' know if anybody's heard about but... (Dr. Laura Koniver) These blankets have these stripes in it, and it's connected to this wire, and see this little plug? You can put it in the outlet; this will help connect, through the outlet, through the grounding system in the house, when you're outside and just feel connecting to nature and it's actually healing for your body. Sometimes, I can't go outside, I'm working or I'm on the computer. Or I'm inside. So, I can so this. This will plug in and connect me to the earth outside and be supportive of my health. And people use these and they sleep with them. And if you, for hours, sleep with it or have it on your lap when you're watching TV or reading, then studies have shown, in your blood and in your joints, and all through your body that pain is decreased and you sleep better and that kind of thing. It's nothing to do with the electricity, you're putting it in the grounding port, right there. I really like the individual anecdotal evidence because that shows me what's possible. Because if something happens to even one person, then I know that it's possible for me. Even if it doesn't happen to anybody else, I have unlimited possibility but if something happens and it's true for that human being, and there's that story and that truth, then I know that's possible for anybody. (Step Sinatra) So the epiphany was this; in a split second after that, I said, well, wow if I created that, then I can create my wildest dreams. (Howard Straus) You know, and this is something that I keep telling people over and over again. Disease, cancer, whatever kind of disease it is, is a construct of how you live your life and what you think about. Yes. And, like in the old Edward G. Robinson gangster movies, when he says, 'I made you and I can break you!' That's exactly what you're telling us. You're telling us, I made this circumstance, I made this bad situation, I can unmake it and make it the most wild, fantastic future that there is. It was Howard's mother, Charlotte Gerson, whose father, Dr. Max Gerson, went down in history as a visionary in medicine. He was curing cancer almost 100 years ago, now. At that time, no one listened to him, either. The Grounding is not very different from the Gerson Therapy. Grounding is relatively free of charge. The Gerson Therapy is relatively inexpensive because we're using natural materials and they can't patent them, so they are against it, because they can't make a lot of money on it. Howard Straus is an MIT Graduate in Physics and wanted to show me a math equation that manifests itself in a design. Perhaps visual proof of math's expression in nature. The door was open. And as I stepped in, a flood of memories came back to me. The past two years have gone by quickly and it was a wakeup call, as to what I had witnessed. (Steve) Get naked and I felt better. Anecdotal evidence doesn't prove anything. I really like the individual anecdotal evidence because then I know that that's possible for anybody. (Dr. Stephen Sinatra) Greatest discovery of all time was what we're doing now, which is Earthing! (Step Sinatra) There is intelligence that is beyond us. Anything is possible. (Dave Olerud) That's a miracle. (Son) Do you see math equations in the universe? (Dr. Edgar Mitchell) We created a lot of math equations to describe the movement in the universe and where things are, with respect to each other. If there is a message, at all about Earthing, it really is about our connection with nature, with the planet, with the universe. (Joseph M. Ritter) Horseshit. I haven't read these studies that you're talking about. What is the result of these scientific studies? (Dr. Shalesh Kaushal) As in all good science reproducible, in this instance, in the case of a diabetic patient. (Dr. David Suzuki) Nature is everywhere. (Skeptoid) What I know, for one thing is that there's a huge number of madeup, New Age claims...I can't say I've heard anyone say they've had a health benefit. (Dr. Gaetan Chevalier) Skeptoid does not know. The Schumann Cavity Resonance, 7.83 Hertz. That is the heartbeat of the Earth, made visible for the first time in history. We need to be connected with the Earth, which gave us birth. If we don't have air for more than three or four minutes, we're dead! If you don't have clean water, you're sick. And the same with the Earth, it gives us our food, the Sun that gives us the energy in our bodies. And the other creatures around the planet, that make the planet habitable for us. If we don't see that that is the bottom line, for our wellbeing and happiness, then we're toast! What Howard saw, in that mathematical sequence discovered by Benoit Mandelbrot, is something considered to be one of the greatest mathematical revelations of all time. Computers did not create this neverending design; they revealed it. Does it carry a message? They say that in all the snowflakes that have ever fallen, that no two are exactly alike. We are snowflakes. There are billions of us but we are all unique. Made with infinite perfection. And if we embrace each other, coming together with a shared, sustainable purpose, born in love, the power of that can move mountains. Nothing can stop it. Anything. Anything is possible. I think now, more than ever, I'm ready for spring.
