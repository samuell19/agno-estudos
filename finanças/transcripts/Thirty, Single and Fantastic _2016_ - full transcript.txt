Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. When I was little I thought it was weird that married women were called "Mrs.", while single women were "Miss." Single women are smaller? To grow up you need to get married? You see? It's not the same for men. They become "Mr." just by getting older. It seems irrelevant. But it is our language telling women, very discretely, "This is your life project, girl, get married. Grow up." Now that I'm thirty something, our language is telling me, "Inés, what you are, has no name." Neither Mrs. nor Miss. You are dating a Mr. "Who acts like a child." A toll booth. A toll booth, Marco! What happened, honey? Nothing, just a guy sleeping on the road. - Good morning. - Good morning. - How much? - $120. Do you take card? Not at all, only cash. Baby, can you get it? I didn't go to the ATM. Typical. - Excuse me? - Nothing. - Here you go. - Here, miss. - Thanks. - Good luck. Thanks, love. You'll never change. It's always the same. "Miss Inés Duarte plus one." Seven years and they don't know my name. When we started dating we also went to Chapala. To your cousin's Quinceañera. She's the one getting married. My niece, not cousin. She's getting married? Well, she's already 22. 22 years old, amazing. - Still the same boyfriend? - No. But I am. What was that? Nothing, it's just... - Regina, congratulations! - Thank you! - The mass was beautiful? - Really? I'm glad. - Good to have you here. - Congratulations. I got married! We are getting old. Shut it, Mrs. Casillas. Just follow my lead, you'll stay young, we can hit the bars. Sure, whenever you want. Shall we sit with your siblings? Wait, that table is for families with kids. You'll be sitting with your parents and aunt Ruth. Oh, OK. In case you felt young, love. With the old people, the geezers. Quit it. - My make up! - Sweetie! - Father-in-law, how are you? - That color suits you. Thanks, mom. You look so pretty. - How are you? - Good. Listen to this, go on. Your shoelace, tie it. At the drugstore, 10% off. At restaurants, 10% off. - Water services, 8% off. - You'll mess my hair up. Discounts for the rest of my life. Well, they won't be loosing too much money. Dad! I feel we just got married, but we are old enough to apply for a senior citizen card, Arturo. And you are almost there. I mean, your ID. Mom. Spherification of fish gel for the gentleman. Excuse me, I'm undergoing chemotherapy, I was forbidden from eating spherification of fish gel, don't you have real food? Daddy, you have eat well. I'll change your fish for my tomato soup deconstruction. Yes, it looks like soy bean sausage, or seasoned chicken. You eat it with a spoon, it's a soup. Every day in suits, hair perfectly combed, - "How are you, sir?" - "Perfectly fine, sir." But they loosen their ties and dance like monkeys. It's a celebration, don't be such a grump. No one's here to celebrate, just to get drunk. Whatever, I would have done the same as your cousin. Go all out! Specially now, since getting married is not fashionable. Don't you think, Marco? What? Oh, the fish is really good. Can I take a picture? All together, please. Beautiful lady, the couple too, please. Thank you, nice picture, handsome people. There we go. Can we take it again, your husband is missing. Her husband will never be in the picture. Thank you very much. Can you bring me something? Whisky soda, please. Of course. - This is just whisky. - I can have it. - Inés? - Óscar! How are you? Weren't you in Europe? I was in Prague, but the project ended 2 years ago. Wow, how long ago did we see each other? Many years ago, I remember that... Your parents invited me, Claudia and my parents to their country house. And, how is your dad doing? He's fine, he's here, by the way. He's strong, he will get ahead, you'll see. And that one time, when there was no Internet, and you couldn't post your article at a blog, or something. You still have the blog? No, I now work for a newspaper. - Nice. - And Claudia? Is she here? Oh, no, we got a divorce. I didn't know, what a shame. Well, maybe, we were together out of routine. Splitting was the first decision we made in years. What about you? Boyfriend or not? Well, yes, there he is. Yes? Who? With the mustache? Doesn't he hit you? Girls, the time has come. Regina will throw the bouquet. All the single ladies come. Girls, run! Your prince charming might get away. - Oh, no! - Cheers. It's good to see you. One, two, three! Here, auntie. You are the desperate one. What? See what I mean? This is awful. Kiss, kiss, kiss. Good afternoon, I'm sorry to interrupt. I want to thank you all, on this special occasion for my wife and myself. Because you joined us to celebrate the marriage of my daughter Regina with José Antonio, who is a son for us too. Can you quit it with the long face? It's not a long face, love. This events aren't my thing. Yes, nothing is your thing. We can leave if you want. If you want to, can you drive? - The hotel is close. - You made reserve at...? No, you made the reservations. No, love, I didn't. Marco, I sent you the link to 4 hotels. Yes, 4 hotels, you didn't say which. And you couldn't make a decision for once? Communication, love... What will we do? Should we drive back? I don't know. If you want to. Can you drive? - Wait! - Stop! I'm wearing high heels! Are you going to stand there? You told me to! So that's it? Let the crazy lady run! Don't come, I'm wearing high heels! - No, no. - What are you doing? - Should I go after you? - I can't believe this! Are you OK, honey? I'm obviously not OK, can't you see? Don't you see, Marco? We are just routine. I'm thirty something, I've been 7 years with a boyfriend I don't live with. Someone who doesn't know what they want? Do you know what you want? I want you to know what you want. What do you want? Should we live together? - You want that? - If that's what you want, love. And if I want to break up? If that's what you want. I need you to make a decision! This wasn't the time, but... Would you marry me, Inés? You were right. This wasn't the right time. Hurray for the bride and the groom! - Inés! - Coming! What's up? Weren't we going for a ride? And you have a hangover. I'll cure you. Go to the living room. I just learnt this recipe, it will work in a second. Do you have any juice? Inés, where's your blender? Found it! How was it? Did you see your dad? Did you come back yesterday? Today? Sensei! Guess what I did. I broke up with Marco. What? You hook up with a "Narco"? - That's very dangerous! - No, not that! I broke up with Marco. What? What happened? He proposed. He proposed and you turned him down? Well that, that's not OK. - Not OK. - Exactly. Wait, pass me the phone, I'll call him. - I can fix it. - Yes. You'll call him? - Yes. I was too drunk. - Yes, call him. Why would you call him? Don't belittle yourself. Come on, you've been with him for years. You were bored, I think it was the right choice. Right choices don't come drunk or during a wedding. Or do they? I'm thirty something, Sensei. What if this was my last chance? Your last chance? You want me to hug you and tell you it's fine? I can do it, but no. You always had way more courage than myself. Do you remember high school? When we all thought we were intellectuals. They all studied Communication. But you took the dive. What did people told you? What would you do with an MA? But look now! You are a badass with a great job, a great life. You used to say, do you remember? - That I would write books. - There you go. When the time comes, you will give the chance to somebody else. And that somebody else might be closer than you think. You are talking about myself, right? Yeah. - Sure. - But... You are right! I don't "have" to be with anybody. Who convinced me of that? What happened? My story is not that kind of story. It doesn't end in a wedding. This is over. I'll start again. We'll need some paint. And some tequila. Now I remember why you are my Sensei. I am Inés. Just like that. Neither "Mrs." nor "Miss." My size isn't determined by men and their ideas, but rather the small changes by these hands every day. The only relationship keeping me awake, is the one with myself. Inés! Congratulations! I read your article and loved it! I thought you were writing about me. Thanks, Susy. I didn't read it. What does it say? Single ladies, taking it from her experience. You broke up with Marco? Yes, last week. You'll see he will come back. But play hard to get, that always works. Wait, she's single because she wants to be, just like myself. That's right. You still have to treat men bad. Come on, Moni. Just read the article. "This is the woman who deserves the 21st century. Confident in herself, and what she wants." I totally agree. If you act all confident, you get a man right away, just put your mind to it. Just put your mind on not being single. You didn't get it. She's saying you don't need a man to define you. You can have many, and they will define you. Inés. Congratulations! Keep it up, I loved it. The Ministry of Economy, you know? Yes. I'll call you tomorrow. Say hello to them, bye. Yes, goodbye. Did you see the views of your article? We only have so many with new viral trends. Yes, but it's not clear. They got it all wrong. - It was crystal clear, Inés. - Yes? But see who you are discussing this with. They say feminism is a trick to hook up. It's like that for them. Who read your article? Girls like them. Yes, but I meant it. Inés, you know me. I was born divorced. I gave my life to this job. I know what you are talking about. I'm very proud of you. But this is a business. The character that you are now, sells. The successful and confident woman who needs no man, who has a vibrator in the nightstand. - I don't have one... - Well, get one. But, above all, keep writing like this. OK. Since we are little girls, we are trained for our fairy tale. What are we waiting for? We are waiting for the prince, this active man with muscles, not like this drawing, but a strong man, to come and save us from dragons and monsters. Why does he rescue her for? To end in a wedding? The heroism of a man is being the hero. The heroism of a woman is being the prize of the hero? Let's get rid of these dumb narratives. This is real life, ladies. We are the protagonists. Thank you, Inés. We'll start with the Q&amp;A. Any question? Go ahead. I totally agree with not being the frail girl from fairy tales. The 50 Shades girl is better, right? She doesn't want a prince to rescue her, she wants him to "hit" her. What's important is that these aren't characters, but rather, real women. We will have to live with who we are for 90 years, not only 90 minutes. I totally get what you mean, the strong woman who needs no man, but isn't it strange that 99% of time, those saying this are single? Not really. We might be single, because we think like that. - Exactly. - Exactly. - Exactly. - Exactly. - Exactly. - Exactly. Thank you very much, Inés. Please, give around of applause for her. Sweets! - Are you just getting here? - Yes, sorry, sorry! - I was getting an Uber. - No, no. I bet it was interesting, about princesses, right? Well... Yes, princesses. Sorry, they took centuries doing my nails. Don't worry, you didn't miss much. I got a round of applause. - It was very cool. - That's so good. I'm glad that you are distracting yourself. With what you are going through, it's hard. Hernán is waiting for our call, to go out tonight. - Piano-bar Thursday? - Please don't. Let's do something else. Why? You always loved it? Yeah, but it's a couple thing. Couples do things like that. Like what? Boring? No, couple things. And I'm feeling like a third-wheel. Look, I was waiting. OK? I get it, it's complicated. But Hernán wants to introduce a friend to you. - Camila... - Emilio. You'll love him. He loves culture, like you. He works at Beaux Arts. Camila, I'm not looking for anyone. I'm happy. I want to be single. OK, what does Miss Single want to do? - I don't know... - Wait, wait. - Let me help. - This is awful. Something cool, I haven't been single for 7 years. Maybe we could... I know, let's throw a party, right now, at my house. - Right now? - Yes! EVERYBODY, COME TO MY HOUSE! WE CAN MAKE MOJITOS I CAN'T. I'M GOING TO THE IN-LAWS'. AURORA LEFT THE GROUP. DIEGUITO HAS A MATCH IN THE MORNING SANDRA LEFT THE GROUP. WE CAN'T. JORGE HAS A HEADACHE. SORRY, WE CAN'T MAKE IT TODAY When did everybody get married? And now? Piano bar? Come on! The mojitos are great. And you love it! I already want one. You seriously parked at the firefighters' spot? There was no other space. I couldn't have made it. You didn't make it. And, did "he" already write you? - No. - Nothing? No, I'm happy... Be careful, Camila! What is wrong with you? - Camila! - Ah, oops! I'll bring your drinks in a haste. No, not in a haste, in a cup is fine. The good thing of being single is that you don't have to deal with the same bad jokes always. The best of a relationship is just at the beginning. - The beginning? - Well, ouch. I'm too lazy to start a relationship now. What if we help avoid the start. I have a friend, Emilio. Camila wanted me to introduce you guys. Well, it was my idea. And I thought, he could come with us to Puerto Vallarta. We don't waste the ticket, and we can go together, no? Not going to happen. OK, think about it. You should invite somebody else. But I want to go with you, you are my friend. But it's a couple thing, just like this. I don't belong in that club. I swear that you'll like his friend Emilio. I don't want that either. I mean it, I'm fine. Will you end up as a lonely hippie, like Sensei? What's your plan? This is my plan. I'm living it. It was our plan. We never wanted to end up like women who do what is expected of them, remember? When we were 15, Inés! We are thirty... Almost forty! Thank you. - Cheers. - Cheers, cheers. Cheers! I was so thirsty. What happened? Do I have light bulbs? - Hello. - Regina? - It's Inés. - Inés? Oh, aunt! That's me. I was calling to see if our plan was still up. Which plan? To hit the bars and so, remember? You are right! - I'm about to go out. - Right now? But it's already... 9:30. Last time I came here, it was El Alebrije. I came to see Gusana Ciega. - Who? - La Gusana Ciega. That's great! Was she your friend? - No. - So you are her aunt? Yes, but don't be so formal. Look at the Vine Jonás just shared. No! It's terrible! He is a cute guy who Gaby friendzoned. No, that's terrible. - I know. - The video is on loop. It's Vine, it is on loop. - What? - Vine. It's on loop. - Vine! - Yes. It's so cool. What's up? Can I take a chair? Hi, I'm Inés. And you? Can I borrow a chair? I'm not alone. I've been single for like a week. But it was my choice. Is it taken? Tense? No! Not at all! - Can I? - Sure, sit. Shot, shot, shot, shot! The real hangover remedy is on sale! Half a gallon for only 50 pesos. Yes, you heard right. For only 50... How's the pain? Did it pass? It's OK. And that? A birthday present my mom gave me. She's worried that I'm alone. - It has a name? - Vinny. - Male or female? - Male. Why don't you marry him? Your mom might stop pestering you. How can I avoid getting old, dad? - Like I do. - How? Holding on. Look at me. I know. My biological clock was so silent, but now it is making a scene. That thing is your idea or your mom's? I want you to tell me the answer, not to be questioned. I'm too tired to tell the answer to my kids. I told your sister what to study and where, and she got a degree on "Mrs." And your brother... He's just your brother. I never told you anything, and you are doing better. And... Do you want to have grandkids from me? I would love to live enough to see that. But that's not a reason for you to have kids. How's your book going? It's not. I had too much work at the newspaper. Inés, you can have kids if you want, write books if you want, go to the beach to cure whales if you want. But this is a fact, your cake has one more candle. Thanks, daddy. Well... THE END Let this be the first of the rest of your story. Thank you, daddy. How old are you, aunt? Thirty someth... How many? You don't ask that, Manuel. - Go out to play. - Sure, but save me a piece. - Sure. - Be careful with the dog. What was your wish, Mouse? You are supposed to keep it a secret, but let's say that I want to be with someone. Inés, when you least expect it, someone very special will come into your life. You are so funny, Blanca. I was talking about dad. Don't even think about taking that cake upstairs, you won't leave us here. He just had his therapy, he is exhausted. Should I help, mom? Where did you leave your boyfriend? Mom, that boyfriend, already escaped. Mom! Inés broke up with her boyfriend, granny. At least you are not living in sin, baby. I never lived in sin. 7 years and you weren't living in sin? It's great you got rid of him, baby. Don't let them disrespect you. Yeah, right. Just don't let it happen for too long. I've told you many times that the biological clock won't stop for anyone. When I was your age, your mom was 15 years old. But those were different times. In my time, we said it was past your sell-by date. We still use it, right? That sounds like something that happens. But I chose to be single. If she wants to be left on the shelf, it's her choice. Bro, please don't help. But what matters is to feel fulfilled. Exactly Mom, listen. On a very important conference, Inés talked about lesbianism. Feminism, mother! Feminism, lesbianism, it's the same. Women who love each other, right? Oh, mom. We'll go to sleep. Mommy is tired. Mommy is tired. Surprise! Love you! Thank you! Hello. - How are you? - Hello! Thank you so much! Maybe it's depressing to be so happy about regressing to childhood, but thanks! You haven't seen the piñata! When you were born doesn't matter, you are as old as you want. Love you! - Anything for you. - Thanks for this. - And Camila? - With Hernán. You know her, she might come later. But it is time to party. Come on! Let's party! You jerk! That scared me, jerk! It always works, always. I almost suffocate with the cake. Sorry. You know? I loved watching you dance. It is very pleasing. Sure, you can make fun of me. No, you did great. Full of movement. - The party was great. - Yes, amazing. Amazing, and look at my toys, so cute. But she's missing... If she had anything there, she wouldn't be standing so straight for so long. There's always a price. I mean, to satisfy this... sexual partner, who I'm sure is very demanding. I mean, he works out. It shows, and he shaves his chest, of course. I don't think he can be too demanding. Look. Show me. - Ta-dah! - Balls. No, now I get it. Now I get it. Because of that he buys her cars, clothes, mansions, to compensate the lack of tools. Exactly! If you can satisfy one aspect, go for others. Well, she has someone who satisfies her. Well, if you need someone to satisfy you, I can't offer you an island, or a castle, because I'm not rich. Not yet, Mr. Architect. But I can do you good. You are such a jerk! Dude, wait! Stop. I had to try at least once. You are the perfect woman. For me. I adore you. You are incredible. You are at your peak, and you are free. My life is to be with you. To walk by your side. To understand you, to listen to you. To give you advice. That's what a man does with the woman he wants to share his life with. I believe that. Or not? That's what I adore about you. Why I love you so much. You are different. Because you are always there. Because I can be myself, not afraid to be hurt or judged. And that, Alberto, is called friendship. I don't want to risk what we have. You are selfish. What you are saying, is what you think. Why don't you ask what I'm willing to risk? The opportunity to be with the woman of your dreams doesn't happen every day. Don't you think we should try? You are confused. Don't confuse me. I'm not the woman of your dreams. I'm your best friend. That is forever. And yes, I want you in my life forever. You piss me off. You have the perfect words to make me crash without a care. I love you a lot. You drank too much? A few drops of this wonderful elixir and you'll feel like new. Ladies and gentlemen, come look at this. The only real cure for that awful hangover. What's up, Camila? What time is it? One in the afternoon! I'm sorry I couldn't make it yesterday. But I have your handsome present ready! Wait, I got one yesterday. It cries, barks, and it's called Vinny. This one talks, has a car, and is vaccinated. OK. Tell him to call me. Is good that we finally met. Camila has said so much about you. She tells me you are single, and looking to meet people. - Oh, she says that? - Yeah. She told me you work at Beaux Arts, interesting. Yes, it is very interesting. I'm at payments department. I'm thinking to change to pensions. That's where the real money is. I see. What should we do? Whatever you want, you are my guest. What about going to the theater. There's a Hungarian jazz quartet playing. Yeah, right! Sure, let's go! Oh, it wasn't a joke? Sorry, thought it was. I'm hungry, should we go to a restaurant first? Sure, whatever you say. Great. The newspaper sounds interesting. I've been working there for 3 years. My column is doing great now. That's awesome. - Congratulations. - Thanks. - I really love to read. - Really? I've been reading some books which opened my eyes completely. Which ones? It's just what I need. You could start with Alien Ancestors. - Have you read it? - Not really. You need to. Then, Visitors from Above. Do you know it? - No. - The most amazing one is: 100 Incognito Reptilians in History. It will blow your mind. It is incredible, incredible. It leaves you thinking. Are we really the only intelligent beings in the Universe? Well, no... Of course not! Thank you. - Anything else? - No, thanks. - Anything else? - Check, please. Of course. - Sorry, it's work. - OK. What is wrong with this dude? No, no, you have to watch this. It just knocked him out! It's great! Wait, if you like that one, you are going to laugh so hard at this one. We call her "La Canchanchana." Did you like it? Thank you. No, let me, Inés. Emilio, I can pay my half. No, please, let me pay. Emilio, I can pay too, I work for it. But I'm a man! Did you like him? I want to know everything! Are you doing it now? No, I'm here alone. What did you do, sweets? Me? I was perfect. And I told the Ambassador: "This is a culture clash." He was fine, but I don't know. - We didn't click. - Boo. There won't be a second date? He'll call tomorrow, but I might make something up, like too much work. Too bad, sweets. Well, at least you left your shell. CHAPTER 1 What should we tell Emilio when he calls? "I'm too busy." No, wait. "I'm going to be busy the next few weeks." "You know what?" I'm going to have too much work these months. Five or six. "Months." Wait a bit. "You know what? I will go to a spiritual retreat, to find myself." Oh, no. "Inés got electrocuted changing a light bulb. Nobody noticed." Vinny! I'm talking to you. Hey! "Well, you see..." Ancient Aliens chose me to visit our home planet. I'm leaving tomorrow. "I know you get, Emilio." Vinny, come here. Come, baby. Are you sleepy? Come on, call already! Was I less charming than I think? I'm better than you! Because I'm a woman! Oh, no! Really? Renata, not now. - Yes? - "Love = fear of being alone"? "Be up-to-date"? This is the most depressing you have ever written. What about the heroin from last month? I know, I don't know. She retired and left me here. You are depressed, that happens to single women. Nobody wants to read a depressed single woman. Depressed single women read the strong single woman. You have to be that! The one who eats the world. The one with a vibrator in the nightstand. I haven't bought one. That might be the problem. Just fix it. Specially if you want people to read you. OK. "Life is theater play with no time for rehearsal." Too intellectual for Tinder. What else? "Single." "Second-hand." "Almost in mint condition." "Dent in self-esteem..." Come in, it's open! "To be negotiated." - Hi! - Hello. - How are you? - Good. - And you? - Fine. I came for my ladder. Great, I was going to call you, sit down. Let me explain. I tried to change the light bulb with the ladder, but I messed up. I can't do it, and I thought it was so simple. I climbed up, grabbed the light bulb. - It stuck to the brown thingy... - The socket. Yes, the socket, that brown thingy. Would you help me? Yes, and we have to paint the wall too. You are right. Which color? Is pink OK? Fuchsia? - Blue. - Blue is fine. - You have a light bulb? - Sure. I'm glad you are here. I missed you. Me too. Of course! - Thanks. - Of course you did. I brought many light bulbs. I'll bring them. Let me see. What about this one? - Ta-dah! - Funny, huh? You always made fun of people using this, and now look at you. I never thought you were so desperate. Thanks for the ladder. Damn! Seriously! I can too, you know? A lot. With milk, or without? A cappuccino, please. Cappuccino. - You are Inés. - Are you Beto? Yes, yes. Should we eat first, or just head to the hotel? You know why I'm here? I decided to give myself the chance to find lo... - It is work related, I swear! - You bastard! Work? Another one? Another wine? - No, no. - Have we already dated? I gave her 5 years of my life. And now I'm with Pedro. You want dessert? The crème brûlée is superb. No, I can't afford it. Inés, I'm sorry I'm late, I was finishing my shift. Did I surprise you? My picture was from when I was in a band, long hair. I'm sorry, I think you are nice. But this Tinder thing is not for me. Bye. She thinks I'm nice. - Did you find everything? - Yes. But it's not for me, it's for a friend. She's been troubled, I want to help her. Of course, this is the best product. - Great. - It is $4,200, please. So much? Yes, but you have no idea. It's worth every inch. I have one at home, and wow. It is the best. OK. Are you Miss Duarte? From the newspaper? No, not at all. - Really? - Yes. Yes you are! I love your column, I always read it. Thank you. Thank you. Your card. Can I have a picture? No, thanks. Inés! Óscar, why are you here? Nothing, and you? - I came to buy a light bulb. - Oh, OK. To the light bulb store. The light bulb in my room broke, and I need light, you know? Of course, we always need a spare. Yes. - What about you? - Inés! Your ticket. - Bye. - Goodbye. - For tax deduction. - Sure, sure. I met you when you were a kid, and look at you. Already deducting taxes. Let's meet someday. - Sure, see you. - See you. How can I turn it off? You know what? You are too young to see these things. "The free woman, and the battery man." Now, you bastard? One month later? Wait a second. Hello? - Inés? - Yes, who's this? I'm Emilio. How are you? Emilio, who? Camila's friend. Oh, Emilio. How are you? Great, all good. I'm sorry I didn't call. I had too much work. I wanted to see if you want to go out again, do something together? Well, the thing is... I'm already dating someone. Really? Camila didn't mention it. She doesn't know yet. We haven't met and this is too recent. I can be myself in this relationship. Nobody judges me. Nobody holds me back. I feel like they understand me. OK. Well good luck with that, I hope you are fine. You too. And I was playing hard to get. Good for you, good for you. - Call Inés. - Calling Inés. Cami, how are you? How long were you going to keep this a secret? I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I've been with him all the time. Where is he from? From the mall. I mean, I met him there. What's his name? - Óscar. - I have to meet him. When? - Is Thursday OK? - Sure, at my house. Love you, sweets, bye. Less than 2 days and I'm already in a mess. - Óscar? - This is your home. I'm Camila, Inés' best friend from junior high. I hope you heard a lot from me. - I'm Óscar. - Yes, he's Óscar. - Hi, there. - My husband, Hernán. How are you? Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. So, how did you two meet? When did you two meet. Wait, wait. Come on in. This is your not so humble home. Right, come in. This wine is good. I had some last week. So good, I will pour it. - From Spain? A lot for you. - No, no, it's fine. Thanks, just a bit. You know me. Well, we have wine, we are at the table. You can tell me now how did you two meet. Our families were friends, we met when we were little. - But you... - We met at the mall. - One thing led to another... - And I invited him. - Nice. - What do you do for a living? I make photo articles. For a magazine? For National Geographic. Really? I mean, really, it's amazing! Amazing! - You travel a lot, right? - A bit. And you don't care, sweets? Not at all, traveling is so cool. She won't let me go to Chapala alone. When I go to the bathroom at night she wakes up to ask where I'm going. - Inés is the same, right? - Well... No, Inés is not like that. She's different. - I'm not like that. - Of course you are. Not at all. Where's the bathroom? In the hallway you will see a Van Gogh, it's original, not really. Well, it is. The door next to it is the bathroom. - Thanks. - So, there, and then right. And the Van Gogh? - He's so handsome! - Not bad at all. He's from Spain, very polite, don't fuck it up. - Why would she? - She always does. That's me. DID YOU TELL THEM WE ARE GOING OUT? I told Lupita many times not to forget the bread. NO OF COURSE YOU DID! - WHY? - THEY WON'T LEAVE ME ALONE! LOOK AT THEM! SHOULD HAVE TOLD ME. SORRY. BUT PLEASE, HELP ME. - It's so good. - Yes, gluten-free. We have both, rye and the other. I think this one with cheese and grapes tastes amazing, also with Serrano ham. - You want cheese? - Let's put some of this. It is the right... - See? - I know. Did she tell you how I confessed? No, but tell us, I love those stories. I serenaded her, with Mariachis. What? Someone from Spain serenaded you? You never liked that. Too macho for her. Unless it is for you, it changes, right? Should have seen her, se even cried. - They all cry. - What? - Which song? - Well, her favorite. - "No controles" by Flans? - Yes. - With Mariachi? - That's amazing. - Very modern. - That's so cool. OK, I'm a cartoon. I'm a cat. I feature in films, but that's not my origin. Yeah. - Do I speak? - Yes, introspective. Of course, a lot. - Do I work or something? - Not at all. You are kept by a dude. I know, I'm Garfield. Yes! That's right! We win! Oh, I'm sorry. No offense. Inés, your turn. OK, let's see. - I am a woman. - Yeah. I'm not from a movie. I'm a little bit famous on printed media. - Just a little bit, says Camila. - Yeah. Am I a writer? Yes. - Mexican? - Like Tequila. Successful? In what sense? When you read my name, did you know it? - For me, yes. - Yes. And you know I know her? Maybe you don't know her. But you know the name. OK... Am I young? Depends on the angle. Mmm. You are young. Mexican, writer, young. Am I pretentious? Yes you are. No. - Is it me? - Yes! You got it! Easy, right? Your turn, Óscar. I was friend with Camila since our teenage years. We agreed on everything. But now we just meet for couple things. Well, used to. It is a matter of time. People change little by little until they become someone else. Relationships end because of that. Whatever. Thanks for helping me. You're welcome. I enjoyed being your boyfriend. Are you in a hurry? Well... I was planning to watch TV with Vinny, my dog. Do you have anything in mind? I want to show you a place. Vinny can wait. Wow, this place is amazing. Really is. I used to take pictures of the city from here. Of the buildings. Of sundown. You can see everything from here. The big picture. The view is so pretty. Too bad there are so many billboards. Visual pollution. Welcome to the new millennium. There, meet Camila. Marriage is her favorite product. Maybe we grew apart because of that. I don't live according to an image. But there is a target market even for those who think they aren't a part of one. But I think that something is happening now. Something is changing right now. Soon we will see the real Inés. Soon the photograph will develop. Scary! What will that photograph show? Something pretty. I'm sure. I need to change the light bulb. And I need to make love to you. I didn't expect a morning like this. What did you expect? I don't know, depressed. Anxious, to see the world's expectations of myself. What do you expect from yourself? I don't know. And you? What do you expect from yourself? Let go. Let go. How so? Time doesn't exist. Only what is happening now exists. Only what is happening now exists. The present. We put too much value on our debts with the past and future. Only this exists. This frame of the film. There is no end to this movie. We are always halfway. Seriously? Inés, what's up? Hello, it's just that... I wanted to see if I could go to your house. Mine is a disaster. - I'm not in the country. - Really? When will you come back? Tomorrow at midday. I can tell the neighbor to open the door, so you can work there. Perfect, I'll wait for you at our love nest. Óscar? Yes, sure. I'll see you there. Bye. What are you doing? - Inés? - Hello! I'm up here. Leave my camera. Hi, how was your trip? It was fine, fine. What happened with your house? It was a disaster. There is no electricity, the roof fell on me, it was a total mess. I'm just not good at changing light bulbs. - OK. - But come. How long will it take to fix it? I don't know. It is the weekend. Nobody can help me. OK, so you are... You are staying here until Monday? Is it a problem? No, not at all. I'm sorry, Óscar. This is weird, right? I'm invading your space. You know what? Pack your bag. We'll go to the country house of my parents. I'll work there, and then I see how to fix it. - It's not that. - I mean it, please. I don't want to be the crazy lady invading... And there's Internet. How strange. Come here, little guy. Last time I was here, I was married. Both my parents and yours were here. Yeah. But this time it will be different. - Very different. - Very different. What's that? Mom? Dad? Inés! - Óscar? - Catalina, Arturo. - Don't come closer! - No, no. What are you doing here? We came to spend... What are you doing here? You never come around this time. Your dad wanted to. - A yellow submarine. - Arturo! We wanted to do the same as when you were little. You did this back when we swam here all the time? Don't you want to join us? Sure, I'm up for it. What are you doing? Christ! This is embarrassing! Put some clothes on! I already decided. I will haunt this house. Don't joke about that. I would bring the Pope himself to exorcize you. Don't ever doubt it. It's so good to see you. And it is such a surprise to see you together. How did it happen? When we last saw his parents they didn't mention it. I haven't been able to tell them, Catalina. This might not surprise them. You were already married. Yes, I was married. See, baby? This one won't run. He did it once, he can do it again. Try not to make the same mistake twice. Arturo! Are you still traveling? Yes. What will you do? What are you talking about? Don't you have plans for the future? Not for the future, Catalina. Time helped me enjoy the present, only the now. Won't you live together? - No. - Mom, stop! You said no? I will move to Italy in six months, Inés. Don't worry about not being invited to Italy. You will be better here. I envy animals so much. Nobody pressures them into getting married. They don't know they will one day die. That's right. Were you planning to tell me about Italy? I won't leave tomorrow, but in six months. - I get it, but still... - Come, come here. Come here. Sit down, please. I don't know where I'll be next week, just like you. And that's exactly the magic of what we are living. The both of us, together right now, OK? I'm sorry if I wasn't clear enough before. No, you were clear. Of course. I'm sorry. That's what I want. To have a good time. No strings attached. You don't know what you want. Don't tell me that. Not when I finally thought I knew what I wanted. You thought? Yes, I thought that you and I were building a love story, wasn't it? I don't know if I'm ready for this story, Inés. Calling Inés. - Hello. - Hi, sweets. I know things got weird the other day. I want to fix things between us. I don't know if you want to fix things. You don't approve of my life since it's not like yours. That's not true. I was terrible. I'm sorry. When I was with Marco, we used to meet a lot. But since we broke up, we've met up only twice in... I know, I know. Would you forgive me? Oh, fuck. Fuck, I'm four days late. - What? - I'm four days late. And I'm too regular. Oh, no, come on. Just, calm down, calm down. Calm down? I know we are mad, but can we have a truce? What's a truce? Whatever, I'll go for a pregnancy test. Don't do anything crazy, I'm heading there. I will be a mother. Óscar is irrelevant. No, wait, calm down. First things first. OK, Inés. It is great! You will still be free. Besides, it's better if you plan it. It's great that you aren't having a baby. No, I will. I will be a mom. What? She's crazy. Hello. How are you? - How am I? - Yes. Good. What are you doing here? I wanted to tell you something. Tell me. - I'll have a baby. - What? - Who...? - Nobody. - You don't know! - Calm down! I'm not pregnant or dating, I just want a baby. - With who? - Nobody. That's impossible, Inés. Artificial, adopted. I just decided it. Man! If you need my help, well... You are so dumb. Sometimes I don't know what's going on in there. I know, me neither. What will you say when he ask about his dad? I don't know, as a kid, I can tell him that his dad is an astronaut, living in space. And when he grow up? When he grow up... When he understand the relativity theory I can explain that by the time he comes back, we will be already dead. Very good! Of course. No loopholes, I get it. I will think about that later. What I really want is to have you there. I miss you. Me too. And he'll need an uncle to teach he about the nasty things men do. Of course. I need to go to the office. - Are you covering a fraud? - No. "Maternity is the highest expression of female freedom?" I know that this doesn't fit with my other articles. My readers won't be happy. - But I will have a baby. - What? - Are you pregnant? - Not yet. Up here, I already am. Oh, I see. You look determined. Then what happens with what I'm about to tell you. I will leave my position. I wanted to offer it to you. What? - Did you get promoted? - No. - I'm getting married. - What? And all we talked about, what you said about being born divorced, married to the job? This will be my second divorce. I can't stand this husband. It's too needy, takes up all my time. I can't. But you can. You are strong. This will be your new husband and kids. Do you want it? You changed your mind. Or what? Do you want twins? Renata offered me her position. That's good. No, no. If I accept then I forget about having a kid, or going to the beach to write my book. - Then don't do it. - No, but... How can I turn it down? All the reputation, money. No editor has had my age. So young... Well, "young." Then do it. - But... - What? What do you want? I don't know. Well, I do. You want to call your dad and for him to tell you what you want. Well, actually yes. Look! His spider sense told him I need him. Hello? You are a bastard. You are a bastard. You can't leave yet. You can't leave me here. Please. You haven't finished your job. I haven't grown up, daddy. DAD &amp; INÉS DAD, ME, MOM, DAVID Inés, this letter has no advice for you. I can't give you any advice. Just like your mom. You are a mix of both, and you will face life, making a bit of both of our mistakes. I'm not writing this to give you the answer. But I know something. The only way for you to do things, is to let you do them by yourself. You won't get the house. I don't want you living in the city. I don't want to give you excuses. The house will be sold, you'll get some money. I leave you the world. Do with it the best that you can in the few seconds that you feel it under your feet. Sorry. Your dad gave me those things for you yesterday. In the end... you are left more fatherless than anybody. I always knew you were more her daughter than mine. Mom... I just lost 50% of all I am. You have an advantage over me on that. Because you are 100% yourself. Even when that 100% was never to your liking. My greatest fear was for you not to fit in. Not like your sister. She's been very lucky. But... Dad told me once... "One day, your mom will understand you." My daughter. That day has come. Thanks, mom. It sounds nice when you say it. But I'm still scared. I don't know what you are going to come up with now. I will go to the beach, to write my book. That's OK. Rest a bit. THE END Why didn't you pay people to pack? You know me, I like to do it all by myself. Thanks. Who would know that the hippie had a talent? It looks great. It looks amazing. Oh, you don't know what I just found. - What? - You'll die when you see it. This is a treasure. Look at this. No! What's this? I won't let him live this down. The hair! So long ago. - Why did we dress like this? - Please don't! My bangs, everything. So embarrassing! I used to copy everything from you, this is your fault. And I was a copy of a bunch of things. What will happen to us? We aren't this girls anymore. We aren't headed the same way. We'll be those friends who rarely see each other, but are happy knowing the other is somewhere, and that's fine. I will miss you. Come here. And I'll miss you. Carlos Alberto! And you felt embarrassed. You brought me to the best restaurant. See how much I love you. - Change your clothes. - Sure, future Mrs. Sensei. Let's go! Welcome. Let me congratulate you for your future wedding. You will taste the best dishes. You are with the best wedding planner of all Latin America. I'm sure about it. My blonde babe always chooses the best. And now, let's eat. Look at this. Hey, and... When do you leave? How is it? - Tomorrow. - What? For how long? I don't know. I'm sure it won't be long. I don't see you living at the beach forever. Well, I don't see myself living anywhere right now. I will go to the beach, live day by day. Time will take its course. We shall enjoy this delicacies, and the alcohol. Best of all, it's free. I bought foam pillows, the feather ones absorb moist near the sea. Thanks, mom. I admire you so much. I admire your courage. Find your happiness. I will do it, mom. - Yes, we made it. - I almost leave! - It's good to see you here. - We had to come. - You fell from your beds. - Yes, thank you. The kids are going to miss you so much. Give them many kisses from me. - Brother. - My mouse. - I will miss you. - Me too. Take care of these women, please. Come visit us. I will miss Vinny way more. Keep up with the jokes. Óscar! Your light bulbs. Thank you. See, you don't know where you'll be next week. I didn't know where you would be. But, just like you said, living with no strings attached has its magic. Yes. Where are you going? Who cares? What matters is that I'm determined. That's important. To be determined. I'm also determined. Yes, living without string attached has its magic, but not as much as recognizing you fell in love. That you are willing to give up on your "freedom." To be free is to dare. To live without fear. Out of fear, I was selfish. I fell in love, got married. And I failed. But I know I want to be with you, Inés. You also told me that I didn't know what I wanted. Now I know. I will find it. But in this part of the story, I need to be alone. Neither "Mrs." nor "Miss." This is me. I mix of what I have lived. Of the people I met. Of good and bad experiences. We all have our own defining story. There is no name for what we are. We just are. And that's perfect for me. Perfect. Thank you very much! Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
