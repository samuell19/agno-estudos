"If you´re happy and you know it, clap your hands". "If you´re happy and you know it"... Sweetheart, don't sing so loud, you'll wake up mom. This is it. Don't get out of the car, it's freezing cold. How are you? If I didn't know who you are, I wouldn't know you. Perhaps it is because it has been a few years. A few years, 35. Welcome. Eusebio, the guard. She is my wife, Claudia. Welcome, ma'am. And my daughter, Julia. Miss, how are you? do you like the countryside? You'll love this one. Hey, I'm freezing. We're not very far, but the road is windy. Be careful. Good people, Eusebio. Here we will be okay, my love. A treasure, huh? There is no better house, in all of San Pedro. And the boat is also for you. The heating is on since this morning. I've already spoken with Rosana, the girl that I found for your daughter. She's very clever. They are going to get along very well. I want you to feel at home. Ricardo, they need your help. Dad, will I be able to sleep up there at all? Come here, come on. Shall we put this inside? -Yes. Anything you need, you just let me know. Any time, whatever. If you are cold, if you need anything... The furniture is also old. -Uh-huh. But hey, they're solid wood. Good, really good. If you need anything else, just say it. Thanks a lot. Seventeen, eighteen, nineteen and twenty. Very good, Now rinse, my love. Have you taken the pills? Have you seen the beautiful sky above your head? Honey... I don't like them, Ricardo. I know they´re good for me, but... I'm getting more and more tired. What you are getting is prettier. Don't be silly. It is really beautiful. We will enjoy it here, you will see. And you'll be able to spend a lot of time with Julia. Diego would have loved this. Let's go inside, it's very cold, right? This was the street with all the stores, do you remember? I was less than ten years old when we left. How can I remember! The bar, to call it that, is in the rice fields. There used to be more, but you see, things are getting worse. Well, this is the headquarters. It´s a bit of a mess, but you know, a man alone... This big table is mine. Now that you are here, you can use it. Up to you. Well, shall we go to the field? And that shotgun? My third arm, I always carry it with me. Eusebio. Mrs. Francisca. Hello, Ricardo. I am Francisca Romero. I´m here to welcome you. You have to be grateful with the people who come to help. And besides, you are from the area, but I don't know you. My father was Rodrigo Gracia. We left when I was a child. I don't know if you... This head only remembers what it wants. I am sure it will be very good to have you here. They are in a very delicate situation. Hopefully we can remedy it before it's too late. Yes. We live in a wonderful land, Ricardo. We hardly go without anything, except work. and now, the water, of course. These people live off the land and these last few years have been a real disaster for them. Yes, I studied the area well. So the idea is to draw up a plan to preserve 'Laguna Blanca', its habitat and, of course, its people. If you have studied the area, you'll know who I am. Almost everyone here works my lands. I am like their source of life. I have a great responsibility. Their source of life. Yes, I feed them and they depend on me. Their source of life, yes. I am sure you will understand what my priorities are. Or theirs, it´s all the same. I know that you risk joining the wetlands expert science committee depending on the success of this project. But don't lose sight of the seriousness around you, that was also yours. You can't give up your roots, and much less reject them. I do not reject anything. That is precisely why I am here, to defend this place. Good. Defending this place also means defending your people. I won´t keep you anymore, you probably have a lot to do. You have a good recruit. Trust him, he is a good man. I hope you are comfortable in your new house. It is the best of my properties. Say hello to your wife and your daughter from me. This third is controlled from the gate which is behind the reedbeds over there. Do you see it? -Yes. Just like that one there are two more, which regulate the northeast and southeast zones Three in total. -Yes, three. And then there are the small ditches, that redistribute the water around the fields. And the general gate, the big one, which is ten kilometers up, at the end of "Laguna Blanca". All of this by the Moors, that they were very clever. It's been so many years and here it remains. The general one supplies the other three. That's right. That one was built later, it is the one that controls total flow in case of emergency. Squacco herons, native. 22,000 hectares to live. They can´t complain, no. Eusebio, I thought that the house was provided by the Reserve. Mrs. Francisca has yielded it to the corporation, but it's hers. I don't know if I want to live there with my family. I don't want to be in debt with her. She knows things about me and I don't know how or why she told me, but few people know. She has contacts everywhere. She cares about her business She has had everything organized for years. and buys the whole harvest from farmers in the area. If they don't sell at the price she sets, they don´t sell. Indeed. Sure, there are many Franciscas around the world. What happened when they found out that the heron started nesting here? What did she do? Well, then she got into the ecologists and the reserve was declared. They created some laws, some measures, but no one really noticed. Everybody did what they always do: hunting, fishing, as usual. The problem is no matter how much it is protected that animal is not going to feed anyone. Here people live from the lagoon, because water is needed to irrigate the rice fields. And when there is no more water? Well, what can I say? Here, day to day life is important, to eat. And don't think every family gets to do it. There is a lot of misery here, Ricardo. And how come you accepted this job? It's a very big life change. We needed a change of scenery. I finished the job in Brazil and I had the chance to return to the US or come back to Spain. And you came back. Yes, I already knew for a long time that Laguna Blanca was going through a critical moment. My father would not have liked to see how this was spoiled. When I see people like you, I feel jealous. I had a wife, you know? She was stubborn... She died young, very sudden. People said that, in time, I would get my life back, but... no. Do you have children? I have one, yes. And I sent him very far away, two years ago. I don't want him to end up here, and as a guard, like me. Don't you like what you do? I like to think that my work is useful to maintain the lagoon as Isabel liked it, my wife. A little more or less what happens to you with your father. Goodness. Ten years. Ten years and three months. Poachers! Dad! Dad! Mom and I have seen a snake! A snake? I can´t believe it? Was it big? How big was it, like you? Huh? What was the snake like? Did it bite your butt? Did it? We stood our ground, but it was quite big Really? -Really. Tomorrow I am going to take you to a beautiful place. You will love it. Dad. -Tell me. Can we look for frogs here? We can look for them, watch them, but not hunt them, okay? No hunting at all. We look at them and at most you touch them. Look at all those coming from there? Do you see them? Are those teals, dad? No, my sweetheart. Teals hide a lot. But we are going to see lots. How long have we been? -I don't know, I have forgotten. Have you forgotten again? So, do you have the memory of an ant? Are you a little ant or what's the matter with you? You are a little ant! Honey, we're going to collect some samples. Coming? It's very difficult, dad. I don't see them. I am coming now, honey. Wait. Let's see. Let me help you, come. Don't move it that much. Come, look. Let's see, put your elbows together, here. Put your elbows together. Lift... I´ll help you, ok? There, you see? Look at that one over there. Julia, sweetheart, come here. Sit here with dad. Stay calm, my love. Stay here. Hello. Excuse me, but you are in a protected area. You cannot hunt here. Says who? What do you mean says who? This is a natural reserve. Come on, leave us alone! Go away! I am asking you politely, but if you want, we can call the guard. Are you mad? Stay calm, my love. It's fine, my darling. Are you mad? Are you mad? Do you think we are crazy? Very much. Do you want me to call the guard? I'm going to call Eusebio. "Call Eusebio", he says. And you, Can´t you speak? You leave the girl alone. Look at how she hides. Cuckoo! Little duck! -Fuck off, don't look at her. What the fuck are you doing? Come on. Goodbye, Gregory Peck. My love, it´s okay, darling. My love, it´s fine. it's fine, It's fine, it's been a fright, my love. Listen, Julia. If mom asks you, we saw a snake and it frightened us. Shut up! Let's see, listen to me! Listen to me! We should be grateful, shit. The Board cares about us. -Nobody cares about us. This man is here to ensure there is irrigation for everybody. We can't just think about this year, the draught is ongoing. Fuck me! You know the field when you work it with your hands, not from an office. -Shut up! Let's them talk, shit! Mr. Gracia comes from another place where he has tried other types of irrigation. We can't go on as usual, because we won't have water for other seasons. Get out, we don't need you! I am very sorry for your situation, but you have to understand that the measures we're going to take are the best for you. In the long run, you will see that they are beneficial for you. In the long run? Who's paying you? We don't need you? You don't know what you are saying. Resources are running out! You cannot fish whatever you like, or draw the water you feel like, nor hunting whatever the fuck you want. Shut up! Come on, man! -You cannot talk to them like that! Be quiet! Be quiet! You cannot speak to them that way! They will go against you. They’ve been against me since the beginning. Those two, pointed a shotgun at me in front of my daughter. They pointed it at you? -Yes, the last ones who came in. They were hunting, and I told them to stop, and they pointed at me with a shotgun in front of my daughter. And you say I cannot talk to them like that? This is going to change, you will see. How could you point a shotgun at him, motherfucker? Don't go too far, Eusebio. Fuck, don't go too far. Don't you go too far. You don't do it. And don't answer me back, because I´ll beat the shit out of you. You don't have to tell me what to do or not do. You are taking their side. We are not at war. -For now. For now? Come on, shut up. Ovidio, two more wines. That guy just arrived. Let's give him a chance. Let´s do what he tells us. Let's try not to... -Not what? No hunting? No watering? Fuck off. Tell Mrs Paca, and see what she says. Huh! Where do you come from? I was down there, finishing the staff roster. The roster? -Yes. Tell your brother, that he is being very friendly with that guy. That guy has come here to screw us all. And what do you know about what he´s going to do? The bullshit about the ducks... Why should anyone tell us what to do? I didn't know that you were also a scientist I´ll have another one, Ovidio, because I am really... sick of environmentalists. Is that guy going to make it rain? I am asking you! Is he going to make it rain? Because if he isn´t, he can just fuck off. Tomás... You are the one who should go home. Sure. If we keep taking water from the lagoon, it will dry up. There will be no ducks. There will also be no water to drink. Everybody is doing whatever the fuck they want. And what should they do? -I don't know. This is what this man has come for. All I know is that the water has dropped a lot for four years. Because it doesn't rain! Can´t you see! Let's see if he has the balls to tell me to stop watering. Let's see if he has the balls! Come on, I'm taking you home. Sure. Ovidio, put everything on the tab. Come on, let´s go. Good health to everyone. They are already here. They will take it as a provocation. A provocation is when everybody does whatever they want. This is the other zone, okay? Put all the signs here, okay? Put the signs here just like we´ll put them there later. A bit more. Sure, so you are there with your legs up and down. Honey, do you really think that we need it? I know you do it for me, but I don't know... And your pills? They are here. I have already taken them, don't be a pain. Listen to me. I don´t think we need that girl for Julia. Love, I am going to be out a lot. It will only be a couple of months, until she starts school. They need an urgent plan. Sure. Is it that serious? -Yes, of course. Yes. Luckily you have arrived to save the world. Sure. There is Eusebio. See you later, okay? Are you going to cut the water off? In the end they will thank me, you will see. See you later, love. What a slave job. A job that nobody has wanted to do. Then you say that here people are in need, but... People are not happy with all of this. How will the machines go to the fields with the chains? Whenever they have to go in, They will. Do not worry. And this, how do you lock it? I'm the only one who has this. But what are you doing? Close that! Close it! Anyone can open this with pliers. Put a clamp to block that, please. And this, how long has it been like this? That is a minimal thing. Call someone to change all the joints that are like this. They are there! Who are they? I don't know. I can't tell from here. Go faster! Let's go and get them! Ricardo, they are already leaving! But they were hunting, damn it! And you are the guard! But, what are you doing? Leave it, take me home. Why do I have to go with you? I want Rosana to come! I said you will come with me and that´s it. Rosana is coming later. Sit down and eat. Why don't you send her and then you can stay? Precisely for that reason, because that's it, I feel locked up and I fancy going to town. And you with me! -I don't want to! Listen. Why don't we all go this afternoon, together? What's the matter? What´s the problem? I want to go now and that's it darling. Well, call her to help you. That's why we have her? Call her. -Yes mom! We call her! Yes? Yes? Okay, well, we will see. That´s enough. Stop talking, you´re making me dizzy. Go and get changed! Come on, take the dolls up with you. Forgive me, my love. I should be helping you. You are worse than me. Stop it. Stop. Get out. -Yes, I'm leaving.. I'm going. Have a good day. -You too, honey. They've given you a very nice house! I don't want shotguns in my house. In your house? What's wrong? Why can't I load the shotgun? Have you come to threaten me? Me? Please go away right now and tell your boss that this is not the way to go. What boss? We don't like an outsider telling us what we can and can´t do. I have come to help you. -Go away! You've been warned. Who was that? A neighbor who wanted to know about the new irrigation system. Ricardo... A neighbour who wanted information, nothing else. Everything's okay. Calm down. Calm down. My brother... is a poor bastard. I don't know what to do with him. He can't come to me like that, Eusebio. He was very upset. Not that way. Don't worry, I'll speak to him. No, don't give it to me. Save it for tomorrow. Okay, I´ll write it down for you. Can I have a kilo and a half, please, of those tomatoes? According to my husband, yours wants to order everyone around. A lot of orders in the short period he's been here. I don't know what you're talking about. My husband has come to help. -To help! To help with what? Not letting us make a living? Not letting us eat? You're confused. I´m not saying it's your fault but I'm not going to serve you. Julia, come on! Mom, let me play for a while! We're leaving. Tomás! Tomás! What? Don't go near Ricardo's house! Why not? -Don't break my balls! Have you heard what I said? I won't say it again! If mom were here to see this, you wouldn't talk to me like that. Did you hear me? If mom were here, you wouldn't talk to me like that! My love, really, They didn't want to sell me anything. Not even some sweets for your daughter. What are you doing to them? Who? Me? What am I doing to them? Trying to help them. But these people are ignorant, specially, Eusebio. They need time to adapt, I guess. What they need to do is listen a bit more and do what they've been told. Hello. -Rosana! Hello, darling! -Are you having lunch with us? Sure, stay, there is spare food. Yes, stay! No, no. I'll do a review and return home, I have the food ready. The pills. So, what? Are we going to play a bit? Okay? Well, if you've done your homework, we can play a bit. In four days, we go for lunch to Rosana's house, as they do serve her. Let´s relax a bit, okay? We're going to speak to... I don't want everybody knowing I take antidepressants. Okay, sure. No, stop it. Honey... I´m so dizzy! Don't you get dizzy? A bit! Whoopee! Faster, faster! Faster. How cool! She fell! -Oh! Thanks. Four poorly fallen drops. Useless in the end. I wanted to apologize to you for my behavior yesterday. And thank you for everything you're doing for me. You told me about your wife and you told me about your life and your things. You were frank with me and I want to be frank with you. Claudia and I am going through a bad time. I don't want this to be seen... I don't want it interfering in my relationship with you and work. Just over a year ago we lost our son. And since then, everything has turned very dark. One of the points is to delay watering at least for a month. It doesn't make sense to release so much water when it's hot. It's wasting it. We can get the same results with less water if we move away from the summer. And if we delay watering, that's bad for sowing, because the plant doesn't complete its cycle. They must understand this is an emergency situation. It worked perfectly in Brazil. Brazil doesn't have our climate. It has a different humidity. I´m telling you that this is going to work. We can't do anything else. Honey, have you taken the pills? I´ll take them later, okay? Dad! -The girl! The girl! The girl! Come on! -Dad! Damn it! Come here. It´s okay, it´s okay. It´s okay, my darling. It´s okay, calm down. It's okay. -Calm down, calm down My love, It´s nothing. Don't say that it´s nothing. They have attacked us, Ricardo. Tomorrow I'm going to speak with Eusebio. What do you have to say to him? They've attacked us. You have to report it. The girl is asleep. Don't pretend that nothing happened. -Calm down, the girl's sleeping. Sure. I know what I am doing. Tomorrow I will speak to Eusebio, that's it. Take it, honey. Take it. Water. Sorry. Eusebio, my wife is hysterical, and she's right. You have to give them something, Ricardo. You have to loosen up a bit. If you give in a little, you'll see how everything relaxes. First Tomás, then they don't serve us, then they are throwing us stones... Ricardo, if you don't give in, I don't know what is going to happen. Fucking rats. I am going to draw an angel in the cloud. Very good. My goodness! I am going to reach the... Okay, this is done. It's important to let it dry well for a couple of hours. Okay, I´ll come with you. Stretch, stretch your knees more. Can't you do it or what? Look mom, how high I go up! Harder Rosana! Who are you writing to? My mother. Really? Be careful she doesn´t fall. Julia, let's go inside. Mom, no! -Come on! Come inside! -Get off me! Get off me! Dad! Dad! What's the matter? Look, look, look! Look what we bring! Look! -A puppy! Is this for me? Look dad, how high I go up! How are you? -Leave me. Huh! Claudia! Be careful with my daughter! Eh, Claudia. Forgive her. What's the matter with you? No! What's the matter with you? With me? -Why are you defending her? You don't know her and you're bringing her into our house. That girl is weird. What do you mean weird? Because she's looking after our daughter well, that's weird? Because I can't look after her, right? Is it that? -Love, calm down. Say it! You have brought someone into this house and you don't think she does weird things. And on top of last night! I am fed up and I want to get out of here! But we just got here, my love. Because they have broken a window? No, they haven't broken a window, Ricardo. They attacked us. You know who they are. And the one with the shotgun? Why don't you go to report it? -Relax a little bit, please. I have spoken with Eusebio. -I don't give a shit. You said that if we weren't okay here, we would go. We don't know anyone We don't know who they are. But they don't want us, Ricardo! What the fuck are we doing here? What are we doing here? Trying to make you better. I don't know what to do or where to go to make you feel better. To help you! Are you telling me that we are here because of me? No, Ricardo. We are here because of you. Just like we went to Brazil for you. Always for you! I've been following you all my life where you have wanted to go! Respecting what you need! and what about what I need! Tell me! You only think about yourself, in being too busy so you don't... -What? What? One for me. One for you. Well, the truth is that this is very tasty. Sweetheart, I am sorry about what happened this morning. But it´s quite hard to get used to this new house, right? We're going to be okay here the three of us, you will see. And Rocky. And Rocky, of course. Let's sleep. Here you are, sweetheart. Did you understand me? -Yes, ma'am. But, mum, I want to play with Rocky. My love, first is the homework and then you can play. Is that clear? A kiss. And eat it all. What if we play first? I don't like that you had to come to see me so soon. San Pedro is a quiet area. It is true that the people are very isolated from everything. And well, sometimes petty crimes occur without consequences. So you come from Argentina. No, from Brazil. We've been living for two years in Brazil, for work. Before, in the United States. Ah, Brazil, with its beaches. I've always wanted to go there, but women rule. And with four females at home I can´t get a word in. Inspector, what are you going to do? What happened was very unpleasant. And we don't feel safe. Look, we are a very small police station for such a large region. Almost 15000 people. But you can send someone over there from time to time. A police car, even once a day. Honey... -It is fine. I will ask that they reinforce surveillance in San Pedro. I can do little more. What I can assure you is that you don´t need to worry. It was four bastards with nothing better to do. and don't hesitate to visit me again if you need to. Thanks. Thanks a lot. I tell you that I have a thorn in my side about Brazil and Argentina. I was told that you were born here. Yes, I was born in San Pedro. My father was the teacher of the school. But we left at the beginning of the 80's. The 80's. Listen to me. You are in a very delicate position, you know. Listen, I would like to tell you something, but only to you. Pardon? Come to see me, I'll invite you for lunch. But... -No, another time. But soon. At least it seems that he wants to help us? Do you feel better? The next time you´re going to be out until dawn, let me know. At least do it for your daughter. -Claudia. Claudia. Eusebio, tell me. "I can't post this. it's nonsense". "We said to delay watering one month, not two". "The thing is that it won´t take and if it does, it will be a disaster". Stop giving me a lecture and post the resolution as I said. "You're looking for trouble and I'll be in trouble too". Publish the fucking resolution as it is, damn it! And don't speak to me like that. Okay, okay. I'll announce it right now. I have already taken the pills. They wouldn't hurt you either. I said that I'll announce it tomorrow. And why don't you tell us now and stop annoying us? Exactly, man! Stop busting my balls! You will know tomorrow! What are you hiding from us? Mrs. Francisca is very upset with you. What he doesn't say is that son of a bitch has come to fuck everybody. And you are on his side! What are you doing here? Come on! Come on, bastard! Listen to me. Listen to me. That´s the last time I hear You talk about the subject, do you understand? Who broke the glass? Who broke the glass? -I don't know. Tomás, I am not going to continue covering your shit. You know what I mean. For fuck sake, think about what you have at home, drunk motherfucker! That's what you have. You want to fuck my wife. What are you talking about, damn it! What are you saying? That's the last time I hear you saying that, do you hear me? She likes you. Go home to sleep. Good morning. Hello Ricardo. No, no. It can't be. This can´t be. You knew about this? You know that this can't be! Talk to that man, damn it! How are they going to do that to us? They will die... Can´t we do anything? What we have to do is not do it. Don't do it. -You have to explain it to him. Leave it, leave it. Leave it, leave it, leave it. That's shit. You are a traitor, Eusebio. Either you do something or you'll pay for it I didn't expect to see you so soon. And your wife, is she calmer? Yes, she is calmer since you spoke to her. If you could do me a favour and get a police car to pass by my house sometime. We will. But I've already told you, few agents for so many people. I miss a good wine, you know? Now they all look the same. Everybody makes wine, you see? A good wine to warm the body up, right? Excuse me, inspector, but... what you told me yesterday, it worried me. I don't know if I misunderstood, but I came as soon as possible. I didn't find the time and the way I said it wasn't the most appropriate, but... anyway, here we are now. -Yes. Listen, did you know that before you there was another biologist? I never remember the name. Zarate is the surname, Does it sound familiar? If I said that I wanted to speak with you, it was to make you aware of how things work here. The house they have offered you is the best in the area. But also the most secluded. Listen to me, I think for your peace of mind, you and your family, should move to town. The house has many comforts, but... I don't know why you're telling me this. Zarate... was found dead in the lake. Drowned in the mud. But he was found dead. What happened? That's the tricky part. When we received the notice, we went to the scene. We didn't even see the body. The Civil Guard had arrived before us, and they were 30 kms further away. Excuse me but I don't understand what you're trying to say. Zarate was a lonely man, as some said. He had to elaborate a report to declare whether or not it was possible to have a reserve in 'Laguna Blanca'. And that brought him complications. So someone murdered him, right? No, no, no, Ricardo. I didn't say that Zarate was murdered. I just wanted to let you know that everything was very weird. The steps that were taken. They never contacted us to collect information. That is the procedure between the security forces. The investigation was closed with a forensic report that ruled natural death by heart attack. No one claimed the body. or if someone did it, it was never known, or I never knew. Sure, but you, what do you think? Because if you tell me this is it´s for a reason. I have been working in this station. for many years But I am not from here, do you understand? Shortly after arriving, I realized of how things worked, and I saw that the only thing I could do was to get everyone in the area to get along. A relaxed life and the right amount of problems. I get along with everyone. I don't stick my nose in anybody's business And that is a virtue here. -And you are a policeman. I am a policeman. I am also... a father, a husband, a grandfather. Ricardo, 'Laguna Blanca' is not the most important thing in your life. The distribution of the water you have ordered is incompatible with the tranquility of your family. That has been published this morning. How do you know? Who has told you this? Bad news flies. I can't tell you more. You can't tell me more? And why did you bring me here? You can't tell me more, but you know a lot. Who sent you to tell me this? It´s not like that at all, Ricardo. Why didn't you tell me anything about Zarate? People are very nervous. -Why didn´t you tell me anything? Get off me, damn it! -I cannot trust you. I am the one who cannot trust you. Nobody knows what happened to Zarate. Why didn't you tell me about him? -Nobody knew what happened! Now, I tell you something, there is no doubt that if you continue like this, you will be the next Zarate. Nobody wanted to know! -Why did you come? You are not helping at all. People are fed up. I do not care what people say! That's the problem! You didn't come to help us! You don't know why you have come! You didn't come to solve our issues. You have come to solve yours, but you don't know what they are. So you´d better go because we don't need you at all. And I'm not going to shut the water off that way! Do not count on me! Huh! What are you doing? Get away from here! -I need to water. Get away. -I need water. Get away from here! It's just water. Are you coming? I am going downstairs for a moment. Yesterday you left the kitchen door open again. How many times have I told you that I want everything closed? I am sorry, ma'am. -Do not call me ma'am. My name is Claudia. Rosana! Rosana! Let's play with Rocky! Julia, first have breakfast and then, homework. Come on. Julia, come here! Come on, Julia, first we're going to have breakfast. Huh? First, have breakfast. Sit down here, sweetheart. That's it. Are you okay? I am going to fire Rosana! She's bad, she's ugly and also she doesn't love you! Now you're going to study! No, mom. Let me play. No! You have breakfast and study! Then I will go to live with Rosana, because I love her more than you. Shut up, squirt. They will hear you. My daughter, I am sick of you! You ignore me! But mom, if I am so good. Not good! You're the worst daughter I have ever had! You will be punished the rest of your life! And I'm not going to forgive you! Be careful there! Bring her! Huh! Get out of there! Pull! Keep pulling! Come on! No! Come on, come on, come on! Come on, come on! Come on! Come on -Let's go to the other one! Come on! Come on, let's go there! Huh! Stop! There is the water¡ There is the water! Good! You haven't understood anything, right? I thought you were smarter, Ricardo. Don't you know water always finds a way, like these people? These people do what you order. They depend on me, I already told you. They could have done all sorts of damage. But no, they have chosen to fight and carry with their business, in the field, in spite of you. You are lucky. And Zarate wasn't. Don't play with my people, Ricardo. And much less with me. Are you threatening me? This is not going to end like this. Of course not. Hello, I am Ricardo Gracia, biologist from the 'Laguna Blanca' reserve. 50, 76, W, T, D. I am calling you from San Pedro. Put me through to Management, please. Get out of here. No. -Get out of my house. Mom, no! Julia, my love, come. Get off my daughter. Julia, come here. Get off my daughter. Get off my daughter! Get off my daughter! Get the fuck out! -Rosana! Get out and don't come back! You understand? Rosana! Rosana! Julia, my love, it's fine. -Rosana! Enough! -You're bad! Shut up! -I hate you! Julia, my love. Julia, forgive me. Forgive me, Julia. Julia. Julia. Julia, my love, forgive me. Open the door. Julia. Julia, open the door! Please, Julia. Julia, open the door! I am telling you to open the door! Julia, open the fucking door! Julia! Maybe you prefer that we undress. Oh, really? Is that what you think? Eusebio has come to look for you. Tell me what the hell is happening. Dad! Dad! Dad! What? Mom has fired Rosana and she yelled at me and hit me! Go to your room, liar. -Don't talk to her like that. Go to your room! -Don't yell at the girl! Come on, my love. Let's go to your room. Then daddy will come up, okay? Why are you talking to her like that? What's wrong? Are you crazy? Eusebio told me that you shut the water. How could you do that? You can't do that! and what do I do? Do you know what to do? Can you explain to me why you fired Rosana? What the hell is wrong with you? I can't stand it here a minute more. We came here to get better and we're falling apart. I spend hours here alone, seeing how that girl who I don't trust is stealing my daughter. She's here to help you! Shit! She's here because you wanted her to look after Julia! Do you believe it was me? Well... Do you believe that Diego was my fault and you don't know how to handle it. Have an anxiolytic, it will be good for you. Forget about the fucking pills! I haven't taken them for days! Have you stopped the treatment? That's why you're like this, right? Sure. Honey, Diego is dead. He is dead and you don't want him mentioned. I don't need pills. I need you! But you are unaware, as if Diego was going to appear from one moment to another. Accept that he died and he will not return, because he won't return. You are unable to forgive me, I don't know very well what. I don't know! Because it was not my fault! I couldn't do anything else! I swear! The same thing would've happened to you! It would've happened to you! Shut up! Damn it! Accept it. Accept it because sooner or later, you will have to. Accept it and don't give these people the hatred you have for me. Close everything, Ricardo. Close everything! Julia! Get under the bed. There, come on. Don't move. Ricardo, what are you doing? Come on, leave that. Come, get in the house, please. Ricardo, please, come in. Come in,... Take it. Babe, take it. Hold it tight. Sing a song to it. Eusebio, take it. Take it. Go up. Go up, please. Go up. Shit! Get out of my house! It´s not fucking yours? This house is ours, and that water too. Miguel, shut the dog up, for fucks sake. No! Motherfucker! Let's see if you have the balls where you have to have them. The female, the wife or the girl? Huh! Open the door! Get out here. Come here. There, hide yourself. Get down there. And now, what do we do? Tomás, leave him now! Let's go! It's okay my love, it's okay. It's okay, my darling. Quiet, quiet, okay, okay. It's fine, it's fine. Ok. It's okay, it's okay. Ok, ok, ok, my love. Ok, my love. It's Ok. Let's get in the cars, come on! Tomás, leave the shotgun. Are you going to kill your brother? That is what you want, me dead so you can fuck my wife. Son of a bitch. Come on, get out of here! Get out of here! It's fine. Claudia, help! Help, Claudia! Claudia, help! Help! Ricardo! Ricardo! Come here. So, grab him over there. Come on, come on. Come on. Up. Claudia, you heard the doctor. You have to take him to the hospital. Let's not complicate it more. Why all of this, Eusebio? Your husband is a good person. But he took all of this as something very personal. I also stopped understanding him. People have to lead their lives, but Ricardo didn't understand it that way. Claudia, he would be better in hospital. And you and your daughter could relax. I'm going inside. Well, I'm going to find a place to bury it. They won't come back but lock yourself well. Mom. -Tell me. I want to see dad. Honey, tomorrow he will be better and you will see him. Come on, eat. He looked a lot like my husband. His same gestures. The faces. And he was never quiet. He was like him. We were in Brazil. Ricardo was almost never at home. Thanks to him, they got to recover a wetland that was disappearing. He was very well. We were great the four of us. Julia was six years old and still drove me crazy. I always had to go after her. Diego was 8. He learnt to swim since he was a baby. Ricardo insisted on teaching him in the little time he had. We were by the pool. He did not stop showing me... how well he swam. The somersaults under water. He was so happy, my boy... In less than a minute, I went to the kitchen... to get Julia's food. And when I came back, he was there, upside down. A stomach cramp, just in that moment. Why did it happen to us? What did we do wrong? What did we do wrong? My boy... Claudia, before you, there was another biologist, Zarate. He came to San Pedro to officially declare Laguna Blanca as Reserve. Shortly after, he was found dead. Buried in the mud. This village... Leave as soon as Ricardo recovers. Listen to me. My husband knew it. He knew it and he put us in danger. I am sorry. "And then, Aurelia the jellyfish said: 'The problem of being transparent is that everything is seen'". Mom. Tell me. I miss Rocky. I know, my love. Rocky must have gone a bit too far and got lost. But as he's very clever, I´m sure he will come back. Come on. However, she was a happy and cheerful jellyfish, that danced with its huge tentacles. like a jelly ballerina. Beautiful and full of life... What if the guys with the shotguns get him? Who, honey? The ones that pointed at us and told me I was a little duck. And what else happened honey? Tell me what else happened. Nothing. Mom, I want Rocky back. Yes, my love. If tomorrow he hasn't come back, we will go to look for him. And now, get to sleep. Son of a bitch. Son of a bitch. Rocky! Rocky! Rocky! Rocky! Don't do this to me again, Julia! Do you hear me? Don't do this to me again! I want Rocky to come back, mom. Claudia. How long have I been asleep? Claudia. You knew everything... and you didn't care. Pardon? Where is the girl? Where is Julia? Listen to me. Where is Julia? Claudia, where is Julia? Answer me. Claudia, where is Julia? Where is Julia? Huh? Claudia, listen to me. Where is the girl? Listen to me. Where is the girl? Where is the girl? -I don't know. Where is Julia? Julia! Julia! Julia! Where are you? Julia! Julia! Come on, my love. Get in the trunk. Calm down. Where is my daughter? From what I see, you are still very confused. Tell me where my daughter is. -Where is your daughter? And do you think you can come into my house like this, to ask me? You think you can come here to trample us, to destroy our way of life, to wear your medal of distinguished biologist. And you don't know, where your daughter is. I won't ask you again. Your father left San Pedro rejecting our land, us. Looking for a better life. We seemed little to him, like you. And he ended up like a nobody. You've never used one, have you? Are you going to shoot me? -Where is my daughter? Julia! Julia! You came to San Pedro like he left, like a coward. Where is my daughter? Jesus fucking Christ! Ricardo, leave the gun. This is too much. Traitor. Ricardo, Mrs. Francisca has nothing to do with your daughter. My brother killed Zarate. A fight, involuntarily. I covered it up, Mrs. Francisca protected him. But she has nothing to do with your daughter, I swear by the memory of my wife. My brother killed Zarate. But I swear that Julia is not here. I told you that you were lucky to know him. Traitor. All I´ve done is protect you. I want to help you. Who would dare to take your daughter? Think about it. And thank Eusebio. If it wasn't for him, you'd be dead a long time ago. Ricardo, your wife is not very well. Go with her. I will help you to look for Julia. Ricardo. Ricardo! Ricardo! Ricardo! Tomás, leave that shotgun. You should have killed me. You should have killed me. Son of a bitch. Son of a bitch! Son of a bitch! Son of a bitch! Son of a bitch! Son of a bitch! Son of a bitch! Ricardo! And now what, what? Huh, you son of a bitch? Now, what? What are we going to do, you and I? Huh? Son of a bitch! Tell me! Tell me what we're going to do! And now, what? Huh? Tell me. What do I do with you now? Huh? No! Ricardo! Ricardo! Ricardo, please! Ricardo! Ricardo, please, no! Ricardo! Ricardo! Are you the one who called us? Eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen and fifteen. We have stabilized him, but here we can't do anything else. We have to go to the hospital urgently. We leave now. Do you want to come with us? They want to take my statement. Thanks. Ricardo. Ricardo. Go on, help dad. My love. Let's go. Maybe in a few years´ time, we are shooting each other because of the water. We will remember you then. I have done everything I could. You have done everything you could, yes.
