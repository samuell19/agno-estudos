You rode so fast with two of us on the bicycle Here Save it for yourself Miss Ho, can I ask you something? What is it? Did we do something illegal? It's not illegal! Just not approved But it's something that makes a lot of sense Do you know what was the banner-hanging about? No, I don't To help Chinese students protest against the government Protest against the government? Why? The colonial government is taking action to stop Chinese education So 7000 students from two Chinese schools have taken over the schools in protest Think about it, if the Chinese are disallowed education There will be no knowledge, no independent thinking and no chance of rising up in the future That's very deep, no wonder you're a teacher Do you know why I want to teach? My dream is that all Chinese have knowledge wisdom and have bright futures Kheong, what's your dream? Me? Please don't laugh at me if I tell you My dream is to quickly master film projection and screen movies to my fellow villagers Many of them have not watched movies My dream is so simple it's making me embarrassed There's no need to be embarrassed Let me ask you, what's that swimming in the water? Fish What's that flying in the sky? Birds So the fish have the water and birds have the sky Different people have different rationales in life What does "rationale" mean? "Rationale" means... "Rationale" means... Anyway, you mustn't get disheartened easily Your name, Kheong, means strength, resilience Resilience means to never stop striving for the best Everyone must have dreams and aspirations We ought to chase after the rainbow You keep nodding, are you listening closely? Yes Then repeat what I've said just now I am Kheong, and it means Resilience Just like... Kill me, or slay me I will fight till the end Kill me, or slay me I will fight till the end Who taught you that? I learnt it from the movies Kill me, or slay me I will fight till the end Chrysanthemum... Chrysanthemum... Chrysanthemum... Miss Ho... Miss Ho... Miss Ho... Wanhua, Wanhua We are leaving, Kheong Bye! Miss Ho! Let me help you! Miss Ho! Leave it to me! Miss Ho I'm sorry for what happened just now Tonight You screened a movie to an audience for the first time Are you happy?

Miss Ho, you promised not to laugh Okay I won't laugh Take a step backward, the circle becomes bigger What's wrong? I am hungry Let's go eat... Satay? Sure! Hand in hand, slowly form a circle Take a step forward... That night, I had the best satay in the whole world Such sweetness Such fragrance We're here Oh Miss Ho Your house is as big as my village And The satay earlier was so delicious Hope we have a chance to go there again Sure It's late Why didn't you let me fetch you? I am Peter Shi Xiaowei's fiance I am Kheong How do you do Let's go inside Your father is waiting for us So you're finally home Peter has been waiting for you all night Look at you, how dare you join in those student protests! You're lucky that the police let you go for Peter's sake Aren't you afraid of getting your family into trouble? Don't worry, Uncle I had a word with the authorities Xiaowei will be fine Thank goodness From now onwards You will not leave the house Then what about night school? Forget about night school Stay at home and prepare for your wedding I'm not marrying him! I don't want a traitor as a husband Stop uttering rubbish! I'd rather die than marry the person I dislike! Xiaowei! Peter Don't blame her It's my fault for spoiling her Miss Ho! Miss Ho! Miss Ho! Why are you still here? Miss Ho! Are you alright? I am fine It's late Go home After that night Miss Ho didn't come to night school anymore This is a special news broadcast Two weeks into the student protest at two Chinese schools Police evacuation began today Seven thousand students were dispersed by force causing nationwide unrest The police have since imposed a curfew So it turns out to be such a serious matter No wonder the cinema takings yesterday were so bad Since there's a curfew No one will be coming to the cinema Manager What? How about giving us a day off? Then, how about not paying your salaries as well? Day off... Dream on! Now get to work! Kheong! Aren't you delivering the film reels? Kheong Remember to get this signed I'm leaving Kheong What's wrong? You look so listless Nothing. I didn't sleep well Nothing can escape my eyes It's not as simple as not sleeping well I really can't hide anything from you Must be because of a girl Nothing of that sort, Brother Lee I'm just worried about Miss Ho It's so chaotic out there and she hasn't come to school for a few days Don't worry. Her family is rich She will be fine Worry for yourself It's chaotic out there Be careful when you deliver the reels I will Kheong Let me give you some advice Miss Ho is not suitable for you Hey! Hey! That's him! Grab him! Don't move! Why are you arresting me? What did I do? You're an insurgent! No I'm not! Don't you deny Sir, what happened? Did you not join the riots at North Bridge Road? I didn't! I was delivering film reels Sir, are you mistaken? Sir, he was riding on this chicky yellow bicycle that day Sir, this is chrysanthemum yellow Hey If we say it is chicky yellow, then it is chicky yellow If we say he is an insurgent, then he is an insurgent! Take him back! And if you obstruct our work we will arrest you both too Let's go Manager! Kheong! Chan Chee Kheong! Why did you join in illegal activities? Who are your accomplices? Spill! Get up, you may leave now Whatever I promised you I have done so Consider yourself lucky! This is considered lucky? To get out of the station in one piece, yes you are I told you that Miss Ho doesn't suit you Who's Miss Ho? Have you thought about why you were arrested? We can't afford to offend people of their status Miss Ho is not what you make her out to be The rich are the rich Will her parents take to us poor folks? Kheong, of all things You are going after a rich girl? Listen to me, Kheong If you don't love me There are others who do If I don't love you There are many others whom I can You young people Don't know what you're talking about Forget her, Kheong Brother Lee Didn't you say we must take pride in ourselves? Yes, I did One day, we will move from having two-wheels to four-wheels Then, you can marry whoever you wish I want to marry Miss Ho! I love her! Even a pig is smarter than you! See for yourself! [Marriage between Shi and Ho family] Much later, I finally understood why Brother Lee was so agitated that night He had fallen in love with a rich girl, Chrysanthemum But her family disapproved of him because he was poor After Chrysanthemum got married Brother Lee put up a happy front but in actual fact, his heart was broken He didn't want me to follow in his footsteps Though adamant about it Eventually, he decided to help us Hurry, my Uncle's coconut plantation is up ahead There's no one living here right now I'll arrange for a boat to take you tomorrow morning Brother Lee Thank you Kheong I know I'm stronger than you in most things But this time, you've outdone me Kheong Do you feel it?

Release him I will go with you Xiaowei! Xiaowei! Don't go! Please don't go! Xiaowei! In order to protect me Xiaowei married Peter Shi She sacrificed her freedom in exchange for my safety If I had known that I'll never see her again I would rather they shot me dead Kheong Here are some mosquito coils Your favourite Milo drink And your favourite Polar cake Thank you, Brother Lee Here I wrote a letter of recommendation for you Go to any cinema in Kuala Lumpur and they will hire you Thank you, Manager Brother Lee Can you help me read what's written on it? Kheong You must be brave, and resilient Even if you forget me you must never forget your dreams Kill me Or slay me I will fight till the end It's time to go I have decided I am not going to Kuala Lumpur After that I went around villages to screen open-air movies And got used to being alone - Oh... then did you... - Hey Another question? Can't you see Uncle Kheong's upset? I'm sorry Uncle Kheong What you said earlier "Kill me, or slay me" "I will fight till the end" A teacher used to encourage me with these words She also said "Everyone must have dreams and aspirations" "We ought to chase after the rainbow" So I listened to her advice and went to Taiwan to study film after high school So it can be said that Uncle Kheong inspired you and your teacher nurtured you Coincidentally, my teacher's last name is also "Ho" Don't tell me they are sisters? Uncle Kheong Look, is this your teacher? How is it that you have her photo? It can't be! She's in England! I'm sure it's her Was she by herself? Yes What... - Uncle Kheong! - Quick, sit! Uncle Kheong! Fool Such a fool Stupid like a pig, stubborn like a bull! Have you ever considered me as your Teacher? You've forgotten everything I've taught you If you don't love me there are others who do If I don't love you there are many others whom I can You've sacrifice your entire well-being for this and now, you want to give up your life too! Tomorrow will be the last of such events here at Queen When you come by the next time this building will likely be gone too Brother Lee This charity screening not only allows us to keep in memory Marilyn Monroe it also helps the poor You're really smart By the way have a look at this, Kheong Many of my friends tell me that this is a good job Not only does it help people it also pays well I've submitted both our applications Come with me for the training Brother Lee, there you go again Don't you think it's useful to learn another skill? I know you mean well However I am really not interested Milk tea, Balu Coming I would really like to unscrew your head and see what is stuck inside Miss Ho has already migrated, why are you still hung up over her? Instead of going to Kuala Lumpur, you choose to stay with this piece of junk Oh dear, was it an accident? Here's your tea - Hey, Balu - Kheong Yes, coming I don't need you to fix my broken mirror Just provide me with more movies Especially the martial arts ones The kids love them Stupid like a pig, stubborn like a bull!

If you aren't helping please keep quiet and let me go home - Hang on - What now? At this point in time, we should use the help of my fans Just share and we are done Balu said Teacher Ho is dead. Why are you still doing this? He said she's most probably dead What if she's not? You're looking for a needle in the haystack No Balu mentioned that he delivered milk tea to her here sometime ago Even though he doesn't remember the exact address It's just a few streets, it shouldn't be difficult ...slowly form a circle Take a step forward, the circle becomes smaller What's next? Teacher Ho! Teacher Ho! What's going on? Please teach us... Have you all forgotten? Alright, let's do it together Okay, together Begin! Hand in hand, slowly form a circle Take a step forward... Excuse me... Are you Teacher Ho Xiaowei? When I first reached England I didn't step out of the house at all I stared out of the window everyday as if my soul had left me Finally, Peter decided to divorce me In 1973 I went back to Singapore by myself Brother, what happened to the cinema? The cinema will be demolished for a new development Do you know where is Kheong? Kheong? Kheong is dead Dead? With that broken down van of his, I wouldn't be surprised if accidents occur Accident? - After that I went to teach at Sungai Siput - Teacher! Teacher! What's wrong Mai Caogen? Teacher! Teacher! Hurry! Hurry! Mai Caogen, where are you bringing me? Uncle says that if there's no audience He won't be coming back So please tell him you want to watch movies too One more person watching will surely bring him back Uncle! Uncle! Wait! Mai Caogen, don't run after it anymore! Uncle is gone No more movies to watch, no more martial arts to learn Don't cry Whatever you want to learn, I will teach you Who would have known that Kheong and I were so near, but yet so far We're here We're here Teacher Ho He's finally awake We finally managed to reunite them and Uncle Kheong loses his memory now? How did this happen? The nurse says he's been like that since he awoke Even the doctors can't figure out why Kheong Kheong Do you still remember the night after class we went to eat Satay?
