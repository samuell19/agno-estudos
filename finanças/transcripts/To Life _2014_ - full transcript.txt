January 17, 1945. The Germans evacuate Auschwitz concentration camp. Rose! Walk... I can't walk. Come on! TO LIFE Paris, 6 months later Sugar! Turns out it was a good job they sealed the door. Thank you, the French police! Drop by for dinner whenever you want. Hello, I'd like to place a classified ad. Take a seat, dear lady. You were deported? Auschwitz, was it? Goodness, you left your youth over there. Did your parents survive? How awful. What's your name? Hélène Krakoupetch. That's pretty. It's very pretty. It's amusing, and jolly at the same time. And the name of the person you're looking for? Lili Levy, née Kupfermann. A friend I met in the camps. We were separated after the liberation, during the death march. She lived in Amsterdam. She was a sister to me. I'd love to find her. There we are. You've written your ad all by yourself. All that's left is to translate it into Yiddish. - She does speak Yiddish? - Fluently. And even German. That's how she saved us, by getting us jobs in the kitchens. Me and another friend, Rose, who couldn't do the march. She died in the camp. I can't promise that you'll find her right away. But the newspaper goes all over the world. Perhaps your friend will read it. Thank you. Hi, Hélène, how are you? A new customer for you. Treat him well, he's my brother. Hélène, this is Raymond. - Hello. - Hi, comrade. She's not in the Party. No, but I'm a sympathizer. He's from up north and been promoted in the Post Office. He needs a new suit. I brought the fabric, Miss... What should I call you? Keep it simple, we're all friends here. Come in, sir. Jacket off, I'll measure you up. Like that. So you were in Auschwitz? How do you like Paris? I'm not sure. With my new job, I haven't had time to think about it. How did you make it out alive? Thanks to two friends I met there. When do you need your suit? I don't want to rush you. You know how long people wait for a phone? Two years. If you can pull strings. I can get it for you in two days. After all your suffering, you deserve it. More than the usual profiteers. We didn't resist for nothing, dammit! You're a real Parisienne. Stands out a mile. I was born in Poland. Stop wriggling, I can't take your measurements. 86. 30. Want to come to the Party festival? Why not? I'm not the phone. You won't get me in two days. - What do you all want? - Lemonade. One, two, three, four... - Four lemonades, please. - Coming right up. I know you. You're the concierge at nº 72. You're still a waiter at Chartier's? Good memory! Don't rat on me, I'm a communist mole. You haven't heard from Hélène? Can I get you something else? Hélène Krakoupetch. Henri Koumerski. My little sweetheart. Aren't you beautiful! Sorry. I'm sorry. We didn't come to sit around. Let's go hear Maurice speak. On behalf of the Communist Party Central Committee... In the camp, I looked for you. I was told you were dead. Why didn't you get in touch? I wrote you at Drancy detention camp, but the letter came back marked, Not known at this address. Can I have a coffee, please? I'd like to see you again. Your wife didn't come back? And your little girl? Have you met someone new? Me neither. I can't talk to people. You're allowed to start over. I can't be intimate with a woman now. 3... 2... 1... Happy New Year! Happy New Year, honey! Happy New Year, kids! Health and Happiness! Well, I know what I wish for in 1946. Another baby. It'd be my pleasure, sweetheart. Let's grow the working class! Raymond, what do you wish for? Don't be so shy. Hélène! Every week, we go to the cell meeting. On Sundays, we sell the Party newspaper, before lunch at my sister's. We go postering twice a month and hand out flyers in the Metro. We're inseparable. So... Wouldn't it be easier to live together? You are so adorable! Happy New Year! I just thought it'd be convenient. It doesn't matter. Hélène, do you know what you wish for? I love your champagne! We're closed, miss. Please... Henri Koumerski! Come down here if you're a man! Just there. I won't be long. Hélène Krakoupetch, just because it's you, I'll run your ad in bold. Every year! Thank you very much, sir. I've found Lili. Berck-Plage, July 1962 I spent every vacation here as a kid. It's unrecognizable! It was rebuilt after the war. Go on, cross! It was going for a song in '45. Now, prices have rocketed. It's mostly my sister that uses it, with the kids. It's lovely. Feels like home. You ain't seen nothing yet. Wonderful! Why should the sea air only be for the rich? It's weird seeing you here. Can I let you into a secret, comrade? I bought this place with you in mind. Who knows why I'm telling you now! The couch folds out? Of course. Look... Careful not to trap your fingers. This way, your own room each. It's a good mattress. We could have slept together, just once! Raymond, you know that was impossible. Why? Why? I've no idea, I don't remember. It was 15 years ago. The keys are on the table. You have my parents' number. I won't be very far. I have to get back. I'll see you out. Last one in's a sissy! You're all alone? No, I'm waiting for a friend. Lili! Hélène, sweetie! Let me look at you. You've filled out a bit, haven't you? I have a surprise for you. Rose? Reizele! Why didn't you say? You're out of your mind! We wanted it to be a surprise. You're dead. Don't talk to me! What if I had a weak heart? Did you think of that? Did you have a good trip? - Yes. - No. We squabbled the whole way. Let's face it, she's not wrong. How come you packed so much for 3 days? But what does it matter to her? I'm not a little girl anymore! Sorry to harp on, but when we left you in the camp, you were dying. I'd like to know why you're not dead! She won't talk about it. I won't talk about it. A quick break? I can still hear you singing in the camp kitchens. It gave us all the strength to keep working. Listen... Let's get this straight right away. We won't talk about the camps. We're here to have fun, go to the beach, eat fish... I feel like an ice cream. Don't you? Come on! I'll have vanilla, strawberry, chocolate and pistachio. In Montreal, it's 3 scoops. Do they get sunshine in Montreal? Anyway, what about you, miss? Coffee for me. And in the back there? Strawberry and lemon. - I'm buying. - No way. My idea, I'm paying. Don't fight over me. Here you go. It's on the house. You're my first customers. Three scoops for the lady. Big ones. Have a good day in the sun, in Berck! If this isn't heaven, I don't know what is. Here, look! Disappointed? You don't like it? It's fine, sweetie. It beats Auschwitz. So, who's sleeping where? I'll take the sofa-bed. I'll take the bottom bunk. You used to prefer the top bunk. Now I prefer the bottom bunk. Look! You take the closet. There's no room, it's full. Maybe I brought too much. Do I look screwy to you? You look alive to me. Not much, but from the heart. Thank you! I wasn't sure about the size, but it won't need much adjusting. Try it on. After lunch. Thanks. I brought some Dutch delicacies. And me, maple syrup. Thanks very much. I hope the herring survived the journey. Smoked sausage, cabbage, gouda, and strudel I made myself. Tuck in. To life! Just think, our first real meal together. Take a herring. Take one. Schmaltz herring is eaten like this, with your fingers. Me throwing my blanket away, when it's -15. Not your blanket, sweetie. You had a jacket. I swear, I was given a blanket, leaving the camp, and I couldn't keep it because it was too heavy. Have it your way. I'm sure you had a jacket. I had a very long journey. I need to get some sleep. And you two keep yakking away! Do you remember saying to me at one point, "Hélène, we're like two soldiers at the front, "we must keep going. "If you fall, I won't pick you up"? I don't remember. You must! I can't have made that up. "Two soldiers at the front!" Then you said you had to find your husband and little girl, Chaya. And I thought you'd betrayed me. I was so mad at you, so mad, that I walked and walked. That's what gave me the strength to stick it out to the end. Sorry, sweetie. We're going to bed now. I gave my testimony in '46. I cannot be mistaken. It's impossible. You're not eating the maple syrup? Come on, it's delicious. We arrived in Montreal with nothing. Nathan bought a consignment of mittens. They were going cheap, but they were all left hands. He sold every one. Now we have a small leather goods store in the main shopping street. He's a natural. He'd sell glasses to a blind man! Sweetie, all blind people wear glasses. You have no idea... He's so even-tempered, considerate, great with the kids... Two sugars, please. Every morning since our wedding day, he brings me breakfast in bed. He finds no end of little treats for me. For example, last winter, he took us all skating on the St. Lawrence. You're telling us you enjoy ice-skating? No but... Honey anyone? What I like is that he's so sporty. Guess what he calls me. Bubele. My little granny. It's simple. I married a one-in-a-million. We won't throw that out. I promise you, sweetie, that went out of fashion in the 50s. Trust me. What's wrong with it? It's just fine. She's right. Your Granny would have worn that. She was too busy getting raped by Cossacks to go to the beach. - What do you think? - Great! Modern, simple. I have one just like it. Take it off, it's drab! It does nothing for you. It makes you look flat-chested. You don't have a two-piece? In a bright check? I'm not wearing a bikini. Try it, sweetie. I'm buying this one. Buy whichever you want, but try this one first. Please. Look what I bought. A real bargain, too. For that price, I'd buy the whole store. I can do what I want. Don't you have enough clothes? Stop treating me like a little girl! I'm a married woman with children! - Well? - What happened? You want a photo? Sorry. How come, in the camp, I never saw you naked? You must have, when we got washed. Just for me, go talk to her. Something's eating her up. I really don't think so. Or if I did see you, I didn't notice you, in the state you were in. I feel like everybody's looking at me. That's the point. It's hardly a very communist swimsuit. Can you pass the sun lotion? Watch what you can do on a trampoline. Never try this when I'm not here. Promise? You have an admirer. He's a country bumpkin. I think he's cute. Can you put some on my back? I missed you terribly. Why didn't you look for me after the war? I did. You were already married. You'd changed your name, sweetie. I'm not happy, Lili. Remember Block 10 in Auschwitz? Where Clauberg did experiments on sterilization? Henri spent two months there. They started on him with radiation. In the end, they castrated him. We've never made love. He can't. He holds me, he caresses me but... I was a virgin when we married... And you still are? Sure. You knew when you married him? Yes. You went ahead anyway? Sure. I had to insist. He didn't want to. Why'd you do that, sweetie? Henri is the love of my life. I've loved him since I was 13. I was a kid when he married before the war. His wife and his little girl were gassed on arrival at the camp. So, when we bumped into each other in '45, I had lost my parents, and we were both on our own. I was 20 years old. C'mon, let's go for a swim. Not too far. I'm scared! There's nothing to be scared of. Know what? Lie back, just let yourself bob. You'll see, you won't sink. Just float along. Float! Don't be scared. Just float along. Really good, wonderful weather. The beach all day. No, I'm not short of cash. They're being so kind to me. No, I don't need money. Stop that! I don't mean to upset you, but back at the camp, you took care of Rose after her trauma. You got out of the camp and did the same with Henri. You're not tired of being Auschwitz's customer care service? I can't change how I am. Did you? Yes. Put yourself first, sweetie. I don't want him giving you chocolate before bed. If you don't listen, I'll hang up. I'm hanging up! Hélène isn't happy with Henri. She loves him, but she's unhappy. Why? Henri can't have intercourse. Anything to do with... Yes. I'm cold. I'm out of cigarettes. I won't be long. - We'll wait. - No, don't bother. Whatever you say. Madame Simone, it's Hélène. Can I speak to my husband? Don't keep him chatting. We're busy! Henri! Coming. I just wanted to say I love you. It's too noisy here. I didn't hear you. I just wanted to say I love you. Still can't hear you. Sorry? Quit playing games, you heard every word. But they felt even better hearing you repeat them. I send you a Groisser Kish. Reizele. Are you awake? Penny for your thoughts. It's Nathan. He has nightmares. He wakes up every night, screaming. It's hell. Why not sleep in separate rooms? He can't bear sleeping alone at night. While I'm gone, he's sleeping with the kids. And with the kids, I just can't cope. I'm too harsh on them. However hard I try, I can't help myself. It's as if I don't love them. Tell me, why did we go and marry camp survivors? I don't know. We have a thing for stripy pajamas? Don't be silly. Time to get up. I'm first in the bathroom. Why are you sitting in the dark? The blind's jammed. I can't open it. Can I make a call? Hold on, let me call Raymond first. Say, the living room blind is jammed. That's sweet of you. We'll be here. Personally, when I got out of Auschwitz, I swore I'd be a free woman. Never bowing to anyone's will. I couldn't stand my husband anymore. It wasn't easy, but I got a divorce. My books exasperate the Jewish community. I don't care. My publisher's very supportive. In fact, I'm going to make it even worse for myself. My next book's about the right of women to become rabbis. The title's She-Rabbi! Nobody will make me change it. You live with someone? Since my divorce, I've not been a very respectable woman. Why do you say that? You okay, sweetie? No! We finish yesterday's first. We're not throwing it out. Whatever you say. Another cup of tea? That'd be nice. So you agreed with Stalin's Jewish policy? I agreed with Stalin. No omelet without breaking eggs. After all, the Russians saved us. Raymond, pay no attention. Raymond's a wonderful fellow. He's kind, generous, ready to help... Courageous! On a march, police batons don't scare him. It's simple, if I didn't love Henri, he's the man I'd marry. Quite the handyman, too! Not wishing to impose, but I'll jump into my trunks and come for a dip. They can wait for me for lunch. He's a really nice guy. Why haven't you... Both of them. What do you think, Lili? He's a schmuck. It's freezing! Great! Cools you off! I'd best be going. Lots of love. I'll go say bye. While you're at it... - Reds back to Moscow! - You idiot! Give me my pants! Shout "Long live De Gaulle" or they go in the sea. No, down with De Gaulle. You asked for it. Pierre! - Long live De Gaulle. - See! That didn't kill you. He makes me laugh. He's a great kid. He turned up in Berck aged 7, with tuberculosis, an orphan... The boy who never got a break. He grew up at the Maritime Hospital. He was raised by his aunt. By the way, I was touched by what you said about me. I really meant it. My little Party comrade, we should kiss. Drive safely. Take care. If you need anything, you know... Okay. This is great! - Warm enough? - Sure. We won't scare you off? We love children! C'mon, Jeannot, in life, you have to take the plunge. René! Not on the same team as your brother. What's wrong? See, you're a brave boy! If you stop crying, I'll teach you to twist. Deal? Go dry off, kid. Do you twist? No, I'm not up with fashion. Give the others a chance, huh? Won't you introduce me? Sure. This is Lili from Amsterdam. And Rose, who's from Montreal. I come from Paris. We met in circumstances... I'm not allowed to mention it. And you? How do you know Raymond? His apartment belonged to my aunt, back when I was a kid. You're very beautiful. And you're a bit young, Pierre. I'm a married woman. Let's find some shade. Everybody, it's time to twist! Get in position! Little ones in front. That's right. Here we go. Are you ready to twist? Let's go! I'm going to dance. You're serious? Thanks! It's not a real Shabbat. There's nothing kosher. And we don't have a man to say the prayer. We don't need one. It's time women stopped being the outcasts of Judaism. I'll say the prayer. Make sure you char the eggplant all over. "Lili, give me a bit more for my little Frenchies." "Hélène, do you have any idea of the risks I run for you?" It's true. You always wanted more. Where does it say a woman can't be a rabbi? In the Bible. We forgot the onions. "We" didn't forget the onions. Why four place settings? That's the poor man's place. You look stunning. Thank you. So do you. Shit! I'm glad you could make it. Good evening. I appreciate the invitation. Thank you. Thanks. Did you bring Club Mickey? Sit down, we were expecting you. - The poor man's place. - How can I refuse? - You interrupted the prayer. - It's Shabbat. The traditional Friday evening meal for Jews. You'll see, Hélène made everything. Keep going. He must cover his head. There. Club Mickey does Shabbat. I thought you were a Communist. We do Shabbat, but we're not believers. Speak for yourself. I believe. I believe you can take that off. I'll serve you. You were sent to the camps? We met in Auschwitz. I'd been there 6 months. Serve it up, before it gets cold. Rose and I were on the same convoy and followed each other in. That's why my number is A5586, and Rose's number is A5591. It's off limits. Rose, you're a pain in the ass! We haven't met for 15 years. You can't decide what's on or off limits. You're not alone here! It's something I said? It's nothing to do with you. Sweetheart, it's quite simple, what's happening to you. You cannot bear to be alive because you let your baby die. You're not to blame. Get that into your head. It wasn't your fault. Until you understand that, you'll ruin your life and your kids' lives. I completely agree but that was out of line. You must think we're nuts. Yes, a little bit. Come on, let's eat. Yummy! It's kneidlach soup. With dumplings made of matzo meal. That's eggplant purée. Chopped liver. And that's tzibele, eggs with diced onions. Won't you be drafted to Algeria? Stroke of luck, as a kid, I got tuberculosis. Medical discharge. So you grew up in the Maritime Hospital? I see Raymond spilled the beans. What else do you know? You came to Berck for treatment because of the pure air here. That's why my folks sent me to summer camp here. I know you were orphaned and raised by your aunt. My intuition tells me you never left Berck. Bullseye! I had a baby. When I got off the train. I heard inmates whispering to us... "Don't stand near the old folks!" "Give them your kids!" My baby was a little girl. Dina. In fact, she was gassed as soon as we arrived at the camp. That's what allowed me to survive. That's when I met her. She was frantic. As she was breastfeeding, she had so much milk it hurt terribly. At Berck-Plage, we're so happy The light is clear, the air is pure The refectory and white beds Not to mention our benefactress Good old Mrs. Janofski You always had to thank your benefactors. In the case of Mrs. Janofski, we hated her. She was a real bitch. She died in the camps. Poor woman. To good old Mrs. Janofski! On your feet, everybody, let's go dancing! I'm not coming. What's wrong? I'm too tipsy to go out. No, you can't back out now. It's nothing fancy, our weekly summer dance. My mind's made up. Don't spoil the evening. I want to have some fun. I'll stay with you. In that case, I'll stay here too. It's dumb, with a party going on outside. I won't go either. I can't go alone. I'm going to bed. I'm exhausted. You're so complicated, both of you. Come on, I'll take you dancing. Let me doll myself up. You're fine as you are. I'll be off then. No, I can't tomorrow. Can I take tomorrow off? No! I need everybody in. Simone, I never asked for a favor. Thanks, I'll remember that. Nothing doing. I'll be there Sunday. Is that okay? I send you a Groisser Kish. Me too. Goodnight. Stay with me. That way, we can keep talking. Fed up, right? Let's sleep. So, how did it go? Can I turn the light on? You're sleeping there, the two of you? You both should have come. He's a lovely boy. Very sweet, very deep. And dances like a god. He was very sad you didn't come. I think he's fallen for you. Sure, he's no intellectual, but maybe... Both of them, see what I mean? Give me a break. He's a kid! Precisely. It's every woman's dream. A boy-toy! He's like your child, but isn't. If I were you... I'd get dressed and I'd go join him. For once, I agree with Rose. Go on! I'll sleep in my own bed. Sorry, I dozed off. No matter, I'll come back later. I'm sorry. I'm no good at this. Come on. I don't have any coffee. Cranberry juice? I move in here in summer. From my room at the Maritime Hospital. I'm a nurse. I've never made love. Sweetie, how long does it to take you to buy cigarettes? Your husband's been waiting 15 minutes. You okay? I stopped off for an ice cream. I won't be a second. Did it taste good? A cup of tea? Well? Now then, where was I... That's right, I couldn't go with Hélène and Lili because I couldn't stand up. When the Russians entered the camp, they left us in the care of inmates from Birkenau. One of them came into the infirmary, picked me up and carried me out. I weighed 35 kilos. Six months later, he proposed to me. It was Nathan. A beautiful story, right? Now, we can't shut her up about the camps. What about you? How did you get away? I negotiated a day off. I went to see Simone, the boss where I work, and I said, "Simone, give me the day off, "or I resign." And? She accepted my resignation. Now I'm a free man. Come on... It's the war. Hitler's staring at England, and he can't get across. It's driving him nuts. One day, Moses stands there next to him. Hitler says, "How'd you part the Red Sea?" Moses replies, "Simple. God gave me a stick. "I went like that and the sea parted." "Wonderful! Give me your stick!" "It's over there, in the British Museum." The sea air does wonders for you. I've got a joke for you. Listen up, it's a quickie. Two Jews meet up after the war. The first Jew says to the other, "Remember me? "You don't remember me? "Isaac... "Auschwitz!" His friend goes... Was it good? It was... Mazel tov! What are you two plotting? I have to tell you, Henri... It's rude here, but in Quebec we talk straight... I think you're a nice man. Let me give you a kiss. Thank you. I think you're very nice too. What have you done to my Hélène? She's all of a fluster. She doesn't want us to part. Goodnight. I'll take the bottom bunk. Of course! Sorry, forgive me, I'm drunk. May I throw it out now? I'll take the luggage down. That's sweet of you. I wouldn't leave Henri. I'd keep both. She won't. She's too communist. She can't lie. Am I allowed an opinion? Henri's a good guy. If she leaves him, he'll never get over it. He survived Auschwitz, he'll survive you leaving him. How come you brought so much? It's Nathan. He worries about me. That's all of it, nothing left. I'll go ahead. What will you do? I don't know. Sweeties, I owe you both an apology. The shoes we brought to the infirmary, me and Hélène, so you could leave with us... I took them off the feet of little Suzie. She was still alive. She looked at me. At first, she didn't grasp what I was doing. Maybe it was the last thing she saw before she died. And you couldn't even walk one step in those shoes. Subconsciously, I always resented you for it. That's why I didn't tell you Rose was alive, the first time we spoke again. That's enough of that. Can you take a photo of the three of us? I'll let you see them off. I'd like to say something. I suggest, sweeties, that all three of us meet up once a year for a few days together like we just had. Here, in Berck. What do you say? Shit! I left my sunglasses on the beach. I know where they are. Did you hear what I said? Can we go swimming? No. Did you do that? You're sick. You need treatment! Remind me to stop for gas. We need to fill up. At Berck-Plage, we're so happy The light is clear, the air pure The refectory and white beds The dormitory and white beds Every Thursday is mail day When we all write our parents To tell them we're having fun And we want to stay even longer But when the day to leave comes We all say our sad farewells Because we really hate to leave The summer camp kids find swell Not to mention our benefactors Including Mrs. Janofski Let's hear it for Mrs. Janofski! Poor woman! She left this world long ago. Subtitles: Simon John Subtitling: Eclair Media
