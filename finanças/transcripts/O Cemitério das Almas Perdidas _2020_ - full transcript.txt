After living so many adventures, I can't believe we're dying on this fucking boat. Full of morons. I've never seen such a storm. -The ship will sink soon. -Damn it! It no longer depends on me. Father! Please. I was never baptized. I want to die in peace. May God bless you. Captain. We don't have to die today. I know of a way to save ourselves. What are you saying? Now you work miracles? Yes, I do. The only thing we need is blood. Now that your thirst for blood has been quenched, go back to the darkness, creature, and take the storm. I, the Carrier of Cyprian's Grimoire, order you to go back to the darkness, and take the storm with you -My God, it stopped -It's a miracle! How should we call you, sir? Call me Cyprian. THE CEMETERY OF LOST SOULS Did you have another nightmare? Boy, just have three shots before bedtime and you don't dream at all. Don't worry about Jorge, Brigitte. Everyone wakes up crying like a child once in a while. Oh, that's right, you do it every day. Shit. You can make these trips worse than they already are. Does anyone know where we are? I have no idea. Between nothing and nowhere, following a crazy old lady. As always. I don't like this place. We've been here before, remember? This can't be good. It's where the pendulum is point to, Fred. We'll stop at the first village that comes up. All right, then. Let's go where the pendulum is pointing to. Let's go north. Yet another shithole. I doubt we'll make even a penny here. Hey, c'mon! Are you awake, man? I don't like this place. I don't know what it is, but I don't like it. How could anyone like a shithole like this? Let's stop chatting and start working. C'mon, let's unload everything, there's a lot to here, okay? A little bit more. That's it. A little higher. That's right. Be careful with the sign, it's worth more than you both. That's it! That's what I'm talking about. -I can hear anything. - Can you see me? - Yeah. -Then it's great. Attention, attention, ladies and gentlemen! The most horrifying show of all times has arrived in town! Come and witness the battle between demons and wizards. Something never before seen! Horror! Action! Magic! You can't miss out on this performance! That's right! Right here, in your town! Uncover the mysteries and dangers of Alchemy with Nomarus! Is everyone ready? It's showtime! Once upon a time, on this Earth, when witches and demons walked freely, Nephastus was born! Such creature launched the world into an age of darkness... and suffering. Centuries later, Nomarus, a legendary alchemist, bitter over the death of his best friend, Noebio, used Nephastus' blood to try to bring his friend back to life. However, evil can't be controlled. You better be ready! Noebio. He was always by my side in every battle. Including those that were only my own. He was a great warrior. And he suffered... from a terrible! And cruel death. The great truth is... Death. is not fair Master Nomarus, something terrible happened! Nephastus has escaped and freed the creatures, leaving a trail of blood and destruction behind. My God, Master! It's Noebio! You've injected him with demon blood? -He'll become a creature! - No! No! Not Noebio. He is pure. His blood is stronger than the creatures'! Get up. Get up, my friend! He is alive! Run! This way! Come on, run! Fast! I saw the Devil. Make no mistake, my brothers, make no mistake. The Devil's church stands before you. They mask themselves as artists but are Satan worshipers. Those who set foot there will be cursed in the Lord! Their money is being used to glorify the Devil! Honorable audience! Those words couldn't be more wrong. Know this, ma'am, we are God-fearing people, but we also believe that there is a Devil sitting on the marbles of hell. Jamanta is too gruff. You didn't have to scare them like that. They pay me to scare people, so I scare people. We're an artistic group who glorifies and blesses the Lord's name Here's the deal. I invite you and your friends to watch the show for free. If you don't like it, we'll leave this beautiful town tomorrow. No hard feelings. God forbid I enter this place of damnation. You are a woman who has God in her heart. You don't need to be afraid of anything! Some smug ladies are coming to watch our show now. It must be as soft as possible, do you understand? I want everyone looking like idiots. -Where is Jamanta? -He's in the back. I'll let him know. Hey, we're having a session for old ladies now, okay? You keep hiding and don't scare anyone. Don't scare them. Seriously, don't. Once upon a time, when unbelievers ruled the world a terrible sacrilege was committed and the Devil was brought back to the world. Many servants of God lost their lives trying to send the Devil back to Hell. Among them was Noebio, Nomarus' best friend, who now prays, searching for God, to try and reach his goals. Welcome, all of you. Come in, come in. Welcome. Welcome. Oh, Noebio, my friend. How many souls we converted together, to the Lord's flock! And now you lie dead before me. Master Nomarus, it's terrible! Despite all my prayers, Nephastus is coming here. Let us pray, Mariat! Let us pray so that this horrible creature doesn't get to us. Master... Look what happened to Noebio, there's no time for prayers! There's always time for prayers, Mariat! But he's breathing! Yes, indeed! He's breathing! God has answered my prayers! He brought my friend back! He brought him like Lazarus! No, no... Don't, don't attack me. Nephastus! Nephastus is coming. Calm down, calm down. Do not fear, for faith will overcome evil. Mariat, take these faithful women through the path of salvation. -Yes, Master. Come with me! -Go, quickly! Hurry, please! We must burn this place to the ground! I promise! In the name of the Lord! Fuck. Let's get out of here, now. Wait, Freddy, let's talk. We're leaving now! Get your things! -What? -All of it! Don't be so hasty, Fred! The odds can turn to our favor. Fanaticism is the worst! It's too dangerous, okay? Start with the dummies and most valuable things. We're leaving now. Think about it, you fool! The cards told me nothing bad will happen here. And they're right, because we'll be long gone. Take off the make up on the ride, okay? Let's get out of here now! Immediately! An actor like me carrying this much weight around. What a waste of talent. They would disagree, but I know my rights. Hey, Jamanta! Take this. Go on! Hurry! This can't be allowed. It's all your fault. -I'm a star. -What do you mean? -I'm a star! -You're a pain! Cheeky! Come on, seriously? Hey, you! Help me out here. I'm having a hard time here and you're over there flirting. Hold on. Hold tight. Jamanta. Jamanta. Gee, Jamanta. Let me go! Help! You motherfuckers! Let me out of here! Help! I counted 48 heads. This land houses more savages than ants. Yes, it was a fruitful crop, indeed. I've talked directly with the governor about the outcome of the campaign. We can count on a generous increase in our profits. Put down your sword! She is mine. Where were you? I saw you come back from the dead. I could tell. I've read a lot about it. Kill you? No, my girl. You are very special to me. You'll stay with me for a long time. Joaquin. Cyprian ord you take this to the crypt. I will not touch that. Wasn't this the Indian body part that you liked most? Or was it the other head? It's not your decision, coward. Just do as you're told. Hurry up, boy, go. - Go! -You little shit. Excuse me, sir. I'd like to make a request. Allow me to alphabetize the savage girl. Why do you care about her? It's not about her, but me. I've always been a teacher and I miss it. It will be good for her to learn about the Holy Church. The 'Holy Church.' I understand. But no. With all due respect, sir, I can also learn a bit about them. This could b useful in our future missions. All right, you can teach her our language. But don't waste time on theology. I am God-fearing. God didn't save our boat, Joaquin. I don't know if you are a fool or just a hypocrite. Just one more thing. If you touch her, you will know hell. I guarantee that. I'm Joaquin. I brought you some food. You need to eat. Don't do that. You cannot die. If you live... your people live. Ayra. We hope... for the light, but so it happens that there is only darkness. We hope for the brightness, but we walk in... darkness. -Isai... -Isaiah. -Isaiah -Fifty-nine. Fifty-nine. -Verse nine -Verse nine Well done. You're a quick learner. That's enough for today. I'll be back tomorrow. Help me leave. I can't help you. The Nauru people will help. The Nauru are cannibals. The fiercest Indians of these lands. They won't help anyone. Give this to the Shaman. He will bring the tribe. And everyone here dies. Don't say that! Somebody may hear it. He is evil. Joaquin is not evil. Yes, I am. Ayra... asks for help. I don't know how, but you've plotted this. I will put you in a hole so deep that no savage in this damned land will find you! Filthy bitch! Filthy bitch! You won't get rid of me that easily. Let's go to the crypt! Take the foolish girl! Quiet, bitch! You will die! They have arrived. Dear Lord, have mercy on my soul! We will all die! Tie her up. Hipolito... pull yourself together, brother. Pull yourself together. The dark book has saved us once. And it will save us again. The only thing we need is blood. Joaquin! You came back. You came back to save me. I will get you out of here. Come. Come on. Hurry, come on Ayra! Where do you think you're going?! Treacherous rat. Take this, you asshole! Ayra! Ayra! Let me go! Damn you! My book! Thank you, my Lord. Drop it! That book is mine! Drop it! Imaculada? Imaculada. Imaculada, my child... Imaculada! My child! Where are you? For God's sake, Imaculada! Imaculada! Come on! Quickly! Come on, everyone For God's Sake! Imaculada! My child! Come back here, for Christ's sake'. Come on, everyone! Quickly My child! No, don't go in there! Imaculada! No! -No! Not my daughter! -Imaculada! Come back here, baby! For God's Sake! -Imaculada! Come back! -Imaculada! -Come back! -Irmaculada! -Come back, baby! -Imaculada! Imaculada! Forgive me. Imaculada! Wake up, baby! My child, wake up! Listen carefully, woman. I want the blood of the damned, of the slaves or the outlaws. But I want it every full moon. Or all the children of the village will die. Do you understand? I do. I'm sure I'll wake up. I must wake up! Help! I want to get out of here! Let me go! Let go of me! Let me out! I want to get out! Help me! Savages! You monsters! Let's start with the elderly. Cyprian. I know that is not your real name. But you like to be called by the same name as the old wizard. Hold on. I stand here before of you... out of free will. No one comes here out of free will. I did. And I brought them as an offering to you. Damn you! Tell me you're lying, mother. No lie will save your life. I know what you really want. You want to get out of here. I have the pages that were torn from the book. What do you want? I don't want to die. I don't want to be this dying old woman. I want to serve you outside these walls. I want to be young and beautiful... ...again That is what I want. That's why I brought this girl here. I knew her youth would be mine someday. Make me become one of you. If this is true and you have the pages, you have my word. They've been with my family for a long time. They were passed down from my grandmother to my mother. And then to me. And now they're yours again. What a bitch. Take the girl. No! Don't do that! No! Not her. No! She is so little! Don't do that to her. Let her go! No! Jamanta! -No! -Jamanta is dead, let's go! I want them all! I want their skin! We are screwed. -It's the only way out. -No, no. I won't go into that hole. You have no other choice, just go! Go, Carlos! I don't want to die here. How did I allow my life to get to this point? What is this fucking place? We're in a grave. Wait, calm down. Look, I promise I'll get you out of here. I promise you, trust me. Jorge... They are coming, Jorge. They are coming. A way out! Come, come. Now it's your turn. Come on, climb it, quickly. Quickly! -I've got you. -Thank you. Jorge! I want to get out of here! Carlos, help me out here! It's the sun! The sun hurts them. But... it's already dusk. Exactly, we've got to get out of here, let's go. Let's go! Brigitte, are you all right? Give me your hand. Who are you? Ayra. What are you doing here? You've seen me in your dreams ever since you were a boy. But you forget it in the morning. And why are you in my dreams? Because you are different. You have a special gift. In your dreams, the sun is always warm. And I feel so alive here. How do you do that? I don't know. Are you dead? I don't know. Why all of this? What do you want from me? I want you to jump. Jump? No, I can't. It's too high. It's your only chance. Jump. Let him go! No! You should have died a long time ago. But I saw your potential. So I kept you alive. I made you strong. And now that we will finally be free, you betray me. You kept me alive? You call this a life? Ayra would rather have died with her people. But even that Cyprian took from Ayra. I am ashamed to have helped you. I hate you. Traitress! Traitress bitch! Very well, so be it. I don't need you anymore. Ayra! Bastard! I'll kill you! Today you will see the sun rise. And it will burn you to the bones. No one shall drink your blood. -Bury him alive. -I'll kill you! No! Ayra! No! I'm going to kill him! No, Jorge, no! You must keep dreaming. You bastard! Kill him, Maciel! You are dead. Bring it on! Calm down, it's me. Come on. Come on. No! No! No! -Get out of here. -What about you? Get out of here! Hardsubs transcript by gooz
