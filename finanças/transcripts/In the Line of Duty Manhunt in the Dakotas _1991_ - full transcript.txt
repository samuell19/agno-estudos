(upbeat music) (indistinct chatter) (tense music) - Prisoner to be released. Gordon Kahl. (door buzzer sounds) - Gordon Kahl, prisoner 97961. These are the terms of your probation, as set forth by the court. You're to report to your probation officer within three days. You must adhere to the probation plan. You must remain in the jurisdictional area unless granted permission to leave by the Federal Authorities. You need a ticket to North Dakota? - What did you say? - Do you need a ticket back to North Dakota? - I don't need nothing from the government. - You're acting kind of tough for somebody that done time for nothing but not paying your taxes. I'll bet you're gonna pay them now. - No. - Farmer's still got an attitude. Didn't you learn anything in Leavenworth? - Yeah. I learned that a nigger with a badge is still just a nigger. - Get your stuff out front and get out of here. - Sure. - How are you, dad? - Hah. - I'm okay. I'll drive. Go ahead. - [Yorie] So how was it in there? - Well, I'll tell you one thing, they'll never get me back. What's new at home? - More people are losing their farms. - Good. Maybe now they'll listen. - Mom had Uncle Bob pay the tax lean on the farm. - She shouldn't have done that. - I know. - She shouldn't have done that. (dog barks) - Hi, daddy! - I want you out of here tomorrow morning. - The government was gonna take it. It's worth more than we owed! Where do you expect me to go? - I don't care where you go. Why don't you go to your brother Bob's place? - Daddy, are you crazy? She had to go to Uncle Bob for help. The IRS would have taken the farm. - You just keep your mouth shut. - I'm not gonna stand by here while you throw my mother out of our home. - You can go too. - Dad, are you okay? - I wanna, uh... I wanna thank you, how you took care of the guns. - Well, you know I wouldn't let you down, dad. - No. (auctioneer talks indistinctly) - This is the fifth farm sale I've been to in over a month, and you know why? Because of the Jew bankers. And their Federal Loan Agency. You see, they're in this thing together. They've foreclosed thousands of farms across the United States. - What good will it do unless they know more about farming than we do? - Oh, you don't understand. Just think, once they control the land, they can control the food supply. And once they control the food supply, they could control the world. - But it's our government, Gordon. They're our representatives. - Yeah, you're right. It's right. It's our government. Our government. Our government that lowers the crop prices, that's our government. It's our governments that raise the taxes, that's our government. And it's our government that took the farm away. We have niggers in Washington, DC living on welfare checks who live better than any one of us here. - Well, now that's damn sure true. - How do you figure on fighting the government? - Just don't pay taxes. You understand? That's what I did, I didn't pay taxes and I went to jail for it, you understand? And I will never pay taxes. Okay, that's enough of that. Now we got some stuff here. I want you guys to look at this material. We got a group that's called the Posse Comitatus that meets every Sunday afternoon, and we can kind of discuss these problems. Only our group is a little different, 'cause I think in my heart, we have solutions. Hold. Okay, excuse me, gentlemen. What do you want? What do you want? - I want to come home. It's been too long. - Well, are you ready to repent? Are you ready to conform to the laws of God and his commandments? - I just wanna be around the children. Please. Let me come home. (Gordon sighs) - Okay. - Ken Muir. - Yes, he's right over there. - Agent Mayberly. - Yes, sir. - I'm Ken Muir, Federal Marshal here. - Pleasure. - Good to meet you. - Gentlemen, this is Agent Richard Mayberly from the FBI office in Chicago. You already know Roger Simms. - Good to see you again, Rog. - That's Carl Greenwood, Deputy Marshal here in Fargo. This is Jim Hobson, Bob Cheshire from our Bismark office. - [Richard] Pleasure. - Sir. - Can I get you a cup of coffee or anything? - Uh, yeah, I think I will. - Drink it at your own risk. These guys make it thick enough to float a horse shoe. - We just try to keep you on your toes, Bob. - Gentlemen, the continuing saga of Gordon Kahl. - Chosen a white man to be supreme, that's my own personal choice. I didn't pay taxes for about five years. - This is from a television show he was on in Texas. - That just shows you that paying taxes doesn't mean anything. I think any intelligent, superior minded, white human being, Christian, knows that paying taxes is like giving gifts to the synagogue of Satan. I mean, for me, I feel- - He's already done a year in Leavenworth, and he's still preaching tax protest. We also have him on probation violation. - Wait a minute. You dragged me on to the Boondocks for a probation violation on a tax charge? - There's more to it than that. He is also a white supremacist. He's stockpiling guns. He also says he's gonna kill anybody who tries to arrest him. - He sounds like some kind of crackpot. - He is a crackpot. And he's damn dangerous. I think the only way to settle this thing without bloodshed is to try to negotiate with him. - Well, I don't agree with that. - Has anybody tried to serve a warrant? - Several times, but he's not an easy man to corner. I've been working down there with local deputy Leland Winters, but somebody always warns him off. - Well, the Posse Comitatus has done a good job of keeping him away from us. - His prison profile says he's a religious fanatic with schizophrenic characteristics. He's also a crack shot with a high powered rifle. - Then we proceed with care, gentlemen, but we proceed. Posse Comitatus is in 23 states, 78 separate chapters. How big is it out here? - It's growing. We've also got KKK, right wing survivalists, neo-Nazis. - I know the type. Little men with big ideas. Guys like him are all cut from the same cloth. They all preach hate, and they all got guns. - Well, you know it's been hard times for the farmers out here. - The whole world's hard. But he wants to blame their problems on somebody else instead of taking responsibility for themselves. - Look, I'm not condoning their actions, I'm just telling you the root of the problem. - These farmers ought to make up their minds. They complain about big government, but they still want their price supports. My parents came to this country to make a better life for themselves and their kids. They didn't blame their problems on anyone. (church bell rings) - Scott's right here, I'll ask him. Scott. You gonna be at the Posse meeting in Medina? - Yeah, Gordon, I thought I would. - I'll see you there. - Yes, sir. - Would it be all right if I come along? I'd like to see Ellen and visit a while. (tense music) (phone rings) - Hello. - Bob, Leland Winters. Gordon Kahl is here. He's in town for a Posse meeting. He's down at Doc Martin's clinic out on the edge of town. It just started, should be here two or three hours. - I'll get a hold of Ken Muir in Fargo. You stake them out until we get there. - Got ya. (phone rings) - Hello. Ken Muir. Hi, Bob. (phone rings) - Hello. - It's Ken Muir. - Yeah, Ken? - Hi, Roger. Listen. One of our deputies down in Medina has got a line on Gordon Kahl, and since you've been head to head with him, I thought maybe you'd like to come along for the ride. - Nope. And I gotta tell you again, I don't think this is the way to go after him. Called Mayberly? - No, he's been called back to Chicago for the weekend. Listen, Kahl's not gonna wait for us, we gotta move fast on this. - Okay. Good luck. - Thanks. (engaged phone sound plays) - Sorry to disturb you, Chief Douglas. Can I borrow a two way radio? - Sure, Leland. Come on in. - I was gonna go to my office, but you were closer, and I needed this thing for a stakeout. - Oh, what stakeout? I didn't hear anything about a stakeout. - It's Federal. It's the US Marshals out of Bismarck and Fargo coming to arrest Gordon Kahl. They want me to keep an eye on him before they get here. - They're crazy. They try and take Kahl and they're in for a world of hurt. Call them back, tell them not to come. - They're not gonna drop it. Can I borrow that radio? - Okay. Just a minute. - [Woman] Oh! Oh beautiful! - [Man] How many candles is that? - [Woman] Oh, should I cut it? - Thanks. You want a ride with me? - I don't wanna get mixed up in this. I don't think I could shoot somebody I know if it came down to it. - Okay. We'll take care of it. Thanks a lot. - Sooner or later, outsiders will threaten our way of life. That is why we must agree to our new charter. - Yeah, well I'm not gonna agree on a charter like that. No way. - Gordon, your racist views run counter to the religious nature of this organization. All people, even blacks and Jews deserve to be protected. - Doc, you know as well as I do, the Jews run the banks. That's the problem. - We're talking about a local bank. We don't even have any Jews around here. - Si Wilson, the pharmacist over in Jamestown is a Jew. - This is just plain crazy. If you go on with this, we can quit this meeting right now. I will not tolerate this kind of malarkey in any movement I'm a part of. - Maybe you... Maybe you should just get out of the Posse, doc. - Look Gordon, the Posse may mean racism to you. It doesn't to me. As far as I'm concerned, we're here to help our neighbors. Not make them fear us. If the Posse ever stops standing for local justice, that'll be the day that this organization and I part company. Now can we get on with it? - Sure. Sure, doc. You get on with it. - Leland, we're in position here. Ken Muir's on his way down from Fargo. Sit tight. - Gotcha. - It has been moved and seconded. - Doc! Sorry for interrupting doc, but we're being watched. - What do you make of that? - We better get a look. (indistinct chatter) - Bob. You better give our friend a call, right away. - He said it's a Federal operation. The Marshals. - It's just Leland Winters, local deputy. He's always watching things. You want me to go up there, see what he's up to? - No, I know what he's up to. Give me the gun. (tense music) - What is it? What's going on? - Nothing's going on. - Bob, they're on the move. My guess is they're headed back towards Heaton. I'm gonna come to you. - Come on Gordon, you can drive with me. Scott and I will ride with Yorie. (dog barks) - Here they come. - [Ken] Bob, this is Ken Muir. We're right behind the subjects and we see you at the bottom of the hill. - There they are, Gordon. They've got a road block. - If this is where it's gonna be, so be it. (indistinct) (gun cocks) - Earl? Earl, there's police lights out on the road. (phone rings) - What in the tarnation. Hello? (baby cries) Dana, get away from the window. Kids, come on, let's go. John. - Give me a gun. - No Yorie, it's not you they want. - They want dad. I gotta help. - No, Yorie! - Get down! - US Marshals. Put down your weapons. - Yorie. - Not like I'm going to miss. - You better back off. - Put down your weapons. - Look. There's no need for anybody to be killed over anything like this. - Ken, we need more units. - We don't have more units. - What do you want? - I want him. Gordon Kahl. - I thought I told you, you better back off. - Dammit Ken, we're face to face with these guys. We're in deep here, move up. - Coming down. - Yorie! - [Ken] He's breaking for the trees. Go. - Put your weapons down and we'll talk about this. - This isn't worth a life, Kahl. (gun fires) - Oh! (gun fires) - Ugh. (gun fires) - Ooh. (gun fires) - Ah! (guns fire) - I'm hit! - Ah! - Officer down! Let's go guys, I'm hit bad. Move it! Officer down! Let's go guys. We're hit bad. (Yorie coughs) (gun fires) (Yorie cries) - It hurts! - Oh my God. - Kill those bastards. - Come on, take it easy. (indistinct) - Gordon! - [Joan] Oh baby, you're gonna be all right. It's all right, baby. - All right, get him in the car. Come on, get him in the car. Come on! (indistinct) - You're gonna be all right. Get him in the car. - Wilbur! You okay? - Yeah, I'm all right. - All right, go, go, go, go, go. - Just get down there and help the others. - Good God. Get me water and sponges. Lots of them. - No, he's going to die! No, doc, is he gonna die? - I'm doing what I can. You have to leave, Joan. Let me work! Ellen! - Joan, come on. - I was afraid this was gonna happen! I warned them! - Jones. Watch your back. - Well, Scott? - We gotta get them both to the hospital, in Jamestown. - We could've talked this out instead of shooting. - It's a little late for that. Leland, what are you doing out there with the Federal Marshals? Did you forget you were raised in this town? - You've gone too far. You're killing people? - I could've killed you. - I know that. - Get that gun out of here! It's a heck of a thing to do, Gordon. To shoot at people over a little income tax. - It's a little more than taxes. - Is it worth getting your son shot? - To me, it was. - Agent Mayberly. - Right. - I'm Dan Krebs with the US Attorney's office here in North Dakota. - I go away, all hell breaks loose! - We have two officers, Muir and Cheshire dead. Three others are wounded. We've got one perpetrator, Yorie Kahl, in custody. Took a shotgun blast to the chest. They're working on him. (indistinct chatter) - You all right? - Yeah. It was Gordon Kahl. Son Yorie. Scott Faul, Wilbur Lundy, and a guy named Lester Thompkins. All members of the Posse. Kahl did the most damage though, he shot Bob Cheshire point blank. He executed him. - You sure it was Kahl? - Hell yeah. I talked to him at the clinic after. - What? - The ambulance took us all to Doc Earns' clinic in Medina, and there he was. - All of you were there? - That's the closest doctor. Yorie was there and I guess Kahl came to see how he was. - So what is it with this place? You guys shoot the hell out of each other, then get together later for a beer? Why didn't you take him right there? - He was armed. Mister, he killed Bob Cheshire. Don't you think I would have gone for him if I could've? - Where'd he go? - Out the door. - Out the door. - We got warrants. We're already moving on Lundy and Thompkins. (intense music) - Federal Marshal! Open up! Get this door open! - No! (indistinct shouting) - [Woman] Let him go! He didn't do anything! - Stay right there. Come on. - [Woman] Where are you taking him? Bring him back! - Prisoner walking! - [Woman] No! Please, no! Wilbur! Oh no, please! - Stop your squawling, Lester. You sound like a stuffed pig. Shut up, will you? Shut up! - What are we gonna do? - I think what we'll do is go to my place, about a half mile down the road. - Mrs. Gordon Kahl? - Yes. - I'm Agent Richard Mayberly, Federal Bureau of Investigation. Do you know where your husband is now? - No, I don't. - You're gonna have to come with us, Mrs. Kahl. - I can't, my son's been hurt. I have to stay here with him. - Lady, you're under arrest for murder. I want every officer I can get by dawn. We under estimated this guy once, we're not gonna do it again. (dog barks) - That his car? - One of them. We're in position, sir. - Gordon Kahl. This is the FBI. Come out with your hands over your head. - That damn dog. - Kahl! Gordon Kahl, this is the FBI, you're under arrest. (gun fires) (dog whines) Dammit, who fired? - Hold your fire! Hold your fire! - Okay, get some tear gas in there. (gun fires) (windows break) (gas canister hisses) Send in the assault team. - All right, SWAT, let's go! Let's move up! Go! Go, go! - All right, we're gonna load it up, get out of here. - Kahl's not in there. There's a stock pile of weapons and a bunch of these Posse Comitatus pamphlets. - Kahl got away? - Yeah, he did. He wasn't there. - All right, let's talk, gentlemen. Gordon Kahl. Where is he? - What are you asking us for? - We don't know nothing. - Drop dead. I want a lawyer. - I gotta go back. My family's there. My wife, my kids. It's my whole life. - You go back and they ain't never gonna leave you alone. - I got no place else to go. We killed them, Gordon. They were like us. It doesn't make any sense. They were Federals, but they were like us. - You wanna go back, you go back. But let's not go around whining. Let's not go around whimpering. Sooner or later, you're gonna have to learn to stand up to them. - I don't know what to do. - You know, in World War II, I was a tail gunner in a B-25 bomber. And we were coming back from a mission, when all of a sudden, our own planes, they came down on us. Now they, they must have thought that we were the enemies. And they started shooting. So I shot them down. - You killed them? - But that's because it was self-defense. And that's what this is, this is self-defense, you see. And that's what, that's what this note tells them. Self-defense. (car engine starts) - James Wickstrom, director of counter insurgency for the Posse Comitatus, and a former US Senate candidate, told his followers the shootout between Gordon Kahl and Federal Marshals indicates the government has declared war on the people of this country. Wickstrom's fire brand speech in Bismarck today included a threat to deputy sheriff Leland Winters, who was wounded in the shootout. - We hold Deputy Winters directly responsible for this. He's a local officer and should not be working with the Federal Marshals. He knows he can be punished at any time by the Posse Comitatus. - Local police chief Larry Douglas criticized the Federal Marshals' attempt to arrest Kahl. - I know Gordon Kahl, he's always been a God fearing man and a good neighbor, and what do those Federal lawmen do? They shoot his dog. - Deputy US Attorney Dan Krebs, who will be prosecuting those involved in the shootout, responded to Douglas' criticism. - The Marshals tried to arrest Kahl 'cause he broke the law. It was their duty. That's the kind of men they are. - I don't get it. Kahl guns down two Marshals. Walks up to one and shoots him point blank in the head while he's wounded, and the people here turn against us because somebody shoots a dog. - Shooting that dog was stupid! But you gotta understand what you're dealing with here. These people are in a crisis, as deep as the Great Depression. They ask Washington for help and all they get is the suggestion they give up their farms that they've had for generations. - Well, there's not much I can do about that. - Don't hold it against these people that they're vulnerable. - These people are going under. Why don't we try a reward? Maybe even one of his Posse buddies will turn him in. - We'll try it. The public's getting the perception of a grandfather in bib overalls outsmarting the best law enforcement officers in the country. Until we find him, they're right. Right, thank you. Come on Winters, let's you and I wrap this thing up. Are you Scott Faul? - I wanna turn myself in, but it was self-defense, there was nothing we could do about it, they came at us. - You're under arrest. He'll have to come with us. - But wait, I've got a note. Gordon Kahl gave me a note. My wife has got it. She has it. Shawna? People were killed out there, but nobody was murdered. This was self-defense. - You go on home, ma'am. - It was self-defense, Leland! - Don't give us that self-defense crap! You gunned them down. - I already told you, they came after us. - That was their job! Kahl was wanted on a Federal warrant. - We don't recognize the Federal Government. - You're married, aren't you? - Yes, sir. - Got a bunch of kids? - Yes, sir. - You work, you farm, you make a living at it. - Yes. - You're not a farmer anymore, you're a killer. You're going to prison and never see those kids again. - You're not gonna get anywhere that way. - What? - People around here, they look at you, and they see big government. They don't think what happens in their lives matters to you. - I've been an FBI agent nearly 20 years now. You know what that means? It means I'm the guy who gets called in when the local law won't do what has to be done. I'm not here to run for office, I'm here to find a killer. - Well if you'll slow down a little, people will be more inclined to help. - How do you figure that threat the Posse put on you? - Well, they just wanna remind me that I am local. That I ought to be listening to them instead of the Feds. - So are you listening? - That's a funny thing. They shot my finger off, I became hard of hearing. - Come on, I'll buy you a cup of coffee. - Sure, okay. (children play) - Hi. Do me a favor, would you tell your father that Sam Evans is here, all right? - Emma, on the porch. I'll take care of it. - I need a place to stay. - Sure. Come on in. We've always got room for a Christian patriot. - Are you telling me you didn't agree with your husband? - Gordon just went crazy over this tax thing. - Why was that? - I don't know. He'd sit up 'til three o'clock reading pamphlets and books. He just got on a track against paying taxes and he couldn't get off it. We almost lost the farm to the IRS for back taxes. - What happened? - I had my brother pay off the lean. Gordon went even crazier, threw me out of the house. I had to beg him to take me back. - Why did you do that? - I love Gordon. And I didn't want to lose Yorie either. I'm freezing. - Oh, uh, here, help yourself. - Yorie always idolized Gordon. It was Gordon who taught Yorie to hate the niggers and Jews. What does a little boy know about those things? - When did your husband get involved with the Posse? - It was later. Gordon believed these things before the Posse came along, and when it did, he just fit right in. After that, it was hopeless. - He thought there'd be trouble. - I just didn't want them to get Yorie. - Mrs. Kahl, maybe we can help each other. Mrs. Kahl would like to make a statement. She will take no questions, but I will afterward if you wish. Mrs. Kahl? - I would like to appeal to my husband, Gordon Kahl. Gordon, please turn yourself in. Our son is hurt, two men are dead, and others are going to be if you continue this. I don't want you dead too. Please Gordon, they won't hurt you if you come peacefully. Please Gordon. I love you. (tense music) - Mr. Starkey, I'm Richard Mayberly, and this is Leland Winters. I'm sorry to disturb you sir, but there have been reports that this man was here recently. I'm sure you've seen his picture in the paper. His name is Gordon Kahl. He murdered two Federal Marshals in Medina. - Mister, I wouldn't tell you where he is even if I knew. - All right, sir. Thank you for your time. These people wouldn't tell you if your foot was on fire. - It's the reward offer. We're getting tips from all over. Kansas, Virginia, Wisconsin. We even have a woman up in Billings, Montana, who says she's personally seen Kahl. - Okay, let's put teams on each one of these. I wanna use all resources to track each lead as fast as possible. - Is there a Gordon Kahl here? His tax accountant wants to talk to him. (crowd laughs) - Sure did. I saw him with my own two eyes. - When was this? - Last Thursday morning, about 6:45. He had eggs, toast and milk. - How do you know it was Gordon Kahl. - Well, I seen his picture on TV that night, and in the papers next morning, so. It was the darndest coincidence. I told my niece right away and she said I should call the FBI. - And you're sure it was the same man? - Well it ought to be. I served him on that corner stool. The one right there. He was sitting right next to Elvis. - Elvis? - Elvis Presley. He was drinking a malt. - That's great. (tense music) (indistinct chatter) - [Man] Looks like we got company, fellas. - [Man] Look alive! (indistinct) - [Man] Right, what do I do with these here? (indistinct) (police siren sounds) - What are you doing here? - Are you Ben Hastings? - I am. - You own this farm? - I do. - FBI. We have a warrant to search this place. We've been informed that Gordon Kahl is hiding here. - Well he's not here. But I'd be proud to have him. He is a great man. - What are you running here? - [Ben] Nothing. We just like to get together once a month for (indistinct). - Search it. Excuse me, Hastings. - If you ask me, that shoot out up there in Medina was just a planned assassination attempt by the government to shut Gordon up because of his beliefs. - I'm not asking you. Excuse me. - Okay, okay. (indistinct walkie talkie talk) - Gentlemen. - They could feed an army. They've got everything here. - Everything except Kahl. (car explodes) (upbeat folk music) - [Male Singer] ♪ Calling Gordon Kahl ♪ ♪ Calling Gordon Kahl ♪ ♪ Gordon, please call home ♪ ♪ Calling Gordon Kahl ♪ ♪ Calling Gordon Kahl ♪ ♪ Please, please Gordon ♪ - [DJ] And there it is folks, "Calling Gordon Kahl" by special request for all you listeners here in Stetson County. Can you believe it? - To tell you the truth, I never could abide Gordon's hate for the blacks and Jews. As far as I can see, people are people. - But you're in the Posse Comitatus with him. - That doesn't mean we see things eye to eye. The Posse Comitatus, in its purest sense, doesn't recognize authority above the County level. Now, I believe that. I'm in the Posse because I believe we have to be self-reliant at the local level, because no pack of bureaucrats in Washington is gonna do anything more than talk us to death. - I work for Washington. You don't have to tell me about bureaucracy. (Doc laughs) - Maybe you ought to get out of government work and get yourself a real job. - The meeting took place at your clinic? - That's right. - What happened before everybody left? - Faul saw Winters out on the road. I was gonna ask Winters what he was up to, and Kahl said he already knew. - Wait a minute. Kahl knew? - That's what he said. - Do you have any idea where Kahl went? - I can't help you there. I'm gonna tell you this, Kahl is probably in the Posse's underground. Maybe you can smoke him out, but he has a lot of help. The Posse knows every move you make. - How's that? - The Posse Comitatus is everywhere. (phone rings) - Winters. Where? I'll be right there. About 10 minutes. (car engine starts) - [Leland] Margaret, this is Leland. I'll be headed south via route 10 by the interstate. If Mayberly calls, tell him to meet me out there. (tense music) (car tires screech) (glass breaks) I'm okay! - I was just on my way to pick you up. What the hell happened? - Guess I had a blowout. (tense music) I used to go hunting out here. Never gonna be the same now. You ever go hunting? - No, I was a city kid. - I like it. Being outdoors. Walking the fields, taking your time. You ought to try it some time. That's where he killed Bob Cheshire. Muir got it up there. I ran up the hill to the ambulance. - [Earl] What you doing out here, Winters? - Hi, Earl. This is Agent Mayberly of the FBI, and we just came out to have a look around. - The FBI? - I'd like to ask you some questions, Mr. Mackie. - We didn't have nothing to do with this. - Come on, Earl. We know that. - Okay. Come over to the house, we'll get some supper. - We don't wanna be any trouble. - It's no trouble. It's nothing fancy, but you're welcome to it. Go ahead and sit down Mr. Mayberly. - You know what really tee'd me off? Is that no one told us what was happening until it was too late. - It just started going too fast. - Yeah. But they put us in danger. The walls of this trailer ain't thick enough to stop a bullet. - The kids were just sitting down to supper. I was holding the baby. They didn't call us 'til it was happening right outside. - You could have warned us, Leland. - I didn't know it was going down right here. Those Marshals ran the show, I was just along for the ride. - Yeah, well no one from the government ever apologized either. - If it's any consolation, I'm from the government and I'm sorry you were put in danger. (thunder cracks) - Want a biscuit, Mr. Mayberly? - Thank you. - They're hot. - I'm sorry those men were killed. - Tell me something, did you call the ambulance that came that day? - No, there was no time, we were busy getting out of the way. - When did the ambulance arrive? - Right after the shooting stopped. - Mrs. Mackie. This is great. Who do you think tipped Kahl? - You think I did it? - No. Did anybody else know what was going down? - Larry knew. Chief Douglas. - How did he know? - I told him. I had to go by his house to get a radio for the stakeout. He didn't wanna have anything to do with it. - Really? How did the ambulance get there? - I suppose Larry ordered it. He was with it when I came over the hill. - Why did he do that? - I don't know. I was just glad it was there when it was. - Is Douglas in the Posse? - Maybe. I never thought about it. You want me to go in and get him? - Yeah. Ask him to come out here a minute. - What do you want? - I wanna know your connection to the Posse Comitatus. - I don't have any connection to the Posse. - How did you know to take the ambulance out to that shootout with Kahl? - Are you accusing me of something? - No, sir. - Then you get the hell out of my face. 'Cause I got nothing to say to you. Nothing. (tense music) - Fill her up, old timer, while I hit the can. - You talking to me? - Yes. Fill her up. Okay, okay. - Just stop washing right now. - What is this? - Nevermind what it is. Now you get down. Come on, get down on your knees. Down, down. That's it, be good. - Don't shoot me. - I wouldn't hurt you. I wouldn't hurt you for the world. That's for the time I spent in Leavenworth. Bro. - Ben! Come out here! - How you doing, Gordon? - Well... (Gordon chuckles) I'm... I'm a little tired and I'm cold, and I've been running around just a little bit. - You want a place to stay? - I appreciate it. - We'll have to find you some place else. FBI was here. They know we're friends. - Oh no, I better go- - No, no. I got a friend they know nothing about. We can always find a safe place for you here in Arkansas. - Thank you. Thank you very much. - You girls, get in the house. Go on, run. Quick! - How's my girls? - Hi, dad. - Karen, you know Ben Hastings, and this is Sam Evans. - Hi. - How are you? Pleased to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - Sam's gonna be staying with us for a while. We were just going out to visit some friends. - Okay, you better get in the house before you get wet. - Karen, I want you to promise me something. Don't mention to anyone Sam being here. - Why? Who is he? - He's just a friend of Ben's. - Oh, okay. - Thank you, honey. (indistinct) (car engine starts) - Come on in. - I lied. I may have some good news. Lester Thompkins has plea bargained. He's agreed to co-operate with the investigation and testify against the others. I offered the same deal to Lundy. He told me to take a hike. He wants some Posse Comitatus lawyer to defend him so he can trash the IRS. I'm gonna pan fry his ass. - When can I talk to Thompkins? - Any time. - Great. (cows moo) - How did Kahl know the Marshals were coming after him? - Winters. He was out on the road watching us. - Winters is not a Marshal, he's local. - Gordon knew Winters was with them. - How could he have known that? - Lundy told him. Lundy made a phone call and found out. - Who'd he call? - I don't know. It could've been Larry. He wasn't at the meeting. - Larry Douglas? The police chief? - Yeah. Gordon and Larry go way back together in the Posse. - What are you two wanting now? - The same thing. Gordon Kahl. - Well last time I heard, he wasn't around here. - [Leland] Boy, you hear a lot, don't you? - Well now, what's that supposed to mean? - I'll tell you what that means. That means it was you who tipped Gordon Kahl that we were coming to get him. - That's a load of bull. - We know you were on the phone to Wilbur Lundy before those officers went out there! They were fellow officers, Larry! You could have got me killed! - We could pull you in as an accessory to murder. At the least, we could get you for conspiracy. But I wanna put an end to all this. I've been up here a while. I know times are tough for the people here. And I know the government hasn't made it any easier. If I was a farmer, I'd probably be the leader of your damn group. - What do you want from me? - I wanna send a message to Kahl. - I can't get to Kahl. - I suspect you know people who can. Tell them we can make it easier on Yorie if Kahl gives up. (door shuts) (judge hits gavel) - Ladies and gentlemen, despite what you've read in the newspapers or seen on television, this is not a trial in which income tax is an issue. Nor is it a trial in which Christian righteousness, nor any sort of Satanic evil is an issue. Murder's the issue. It's the sole issue. - Where are you from, Sam? - North Dakota. - Well, what are you doing down here? - I don't know, I guess... I guess I don't have any other place to go. I mean, the Commies and the Jews, they ran me out. - You miss your family? - I miss my son. - They live in North Dakota? - They sure do. - Why don't you just go back? - I don't know. Maybe... Maybe because my name is Gordon Kahl. - Better listen to what this man has to say. We've had word from some of our people. They say the FBI might be willing to make a deal in this case. - That's what they're saying. They'll go easier on your boy. - I'm not gonna do it. I'm not... I'm not gonna make a deal with the servants of Satan. - It's your son. - I know that. (thunder cracks) I know, I know it's my son. God bless him. And he's an upright soldier of Christ. I'm not going in there and I'm not going to make a deal with the government. Period. (tense music) (dog barks) - You should take some muffins. - Thanks. Real nice of you. - Ben. I want Mr. Kahl out of here. Some day, the law's gonna come for him. My family lives here. I don't want them hurt. - I don't know if I can do that, Karen. - You heard him. I think he wants a fight. He may not care about his family, but I care about mine. - Okay. I'll see what I can do. - [Judge] Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, have you reached a verdict? - We have, your honor. We, the jury, find the defendant Joan Kahl, not guilty of all charges. (crowd claps) (judge hits gavel) We find the defendants Yorie Kahl and Scott Faul guilty of second degree murder in the deaths of... (audience complains) (judge hits gavel) In the deaths of Ken Muir and Robert Cheshire. We find the defendant Wilbur Lundy not guilty on the seven assault charges, and guilty on charges of conspiracy and harboring a Federal felony suspect. (audience complains) - [Reporter] Here they come now. - Krebs! Are you disappointed with the second degree murder verdicts? - Nah, murder's murder. As far as I'm concerned, justice was done and done fairly. - Mr. Mayberly, were you disappointed? - No, sir. When Gordon Kahl's brought to justice, it'll be first degree murder. (reporters speak indistinctly) - [Woman] Federal building. - I need someone in the FBI. - Mayberly? - Yes, sir. - Blasingame with the Little Rock office. - What do you know about this woman who turned in the tip? Is she on the level? - You'll have to decide for yourself. She'll only talk to the agent in charge. - What are you gonna get? - I'm gonna get a stick of rock. - Mrs. Robinson? - Yes. - I'm Richard Mayberly. - Um, maybe we should sit over there. You girls sit here quietly. I'll be right back. This man Sam stayed with my father until just a few days ago. I don't want my father involved. I want him to have immunity. - That's not something I can guarantee. - There's a reward, right? - $15,000. We'll order in a minute. How do you know this man Sam is Gordon Kahl? - He told me he was. - Do you have some proof? Something with his fingerprints? A letter? - Here's the book he read while he stayed with us. You're one of them. You work for the Jews. - What, one of whom? - That's a mason's ring. The masons are controlled by the rich Jews who wanna bring this country under the control of their One World Government. - This ring is from my college fraternity. I'm a law enforcement officer. I work for the FBI, not the Jews, the masons or anyone else. If such a conspiracy exists, I'm not aware of it or a party to it. My job is to find Gordon Kahl and arrest him for the murders of two US Marshals. Please, I can't do it alone. - If he thinks you're closing in on him, he's going to fight. I'm scared we're going to be in the way when you do. - I want you safe and alive. I want Gordon Kahl safe and alive. Where is he now? - He must be with Ben Hastings. (helicopter propeller whirs) (tense music) (indistinct chatter) - Problem is he's holed up out there with an arsenal. From everything I hear, he likes to shoot. - He does, and he's one wily old bastard. - Gene, meet Richard Mayberly. - Hey. - Ah, so you chased your bad guy down into our neck of the woods? - Yeah, sorry for the inconvenience. - Here we are. - Okay. - Gonna be staged here while the SWAT team surrounds the house from behind. State troopers back us up on the highway. Once we've moved in, we'll order the people out of the house with a loud speaker. If they won't come out, we go to the tear gas. - They're already making t-shirts with Kahl's picture on them. If we kill him, the Posse will make this home town hero a martyr. So I wanna take him alive. - The bottom line is we take him. Okay, guys. Let's go. (tense music) (car engines start) - All we need now is a dog. - What's that? - Nothing. - We're gonna take the driveway. (car engine starts) (gun cocks) - Turn it off. - Where are you going? - To check on my cattle. - Leave the gun and get out of the truck. Now. - Who else is in the house? - Just my wife. - Okay, well let's see. Tell her to come out. - Sally! Come on out! - [Man On TV] You Mr. Mayor will be the official. You will make arrangements for the city parade and reception for John when he gets home. And don't give him the hi-hat. - [Mayor On TV] No hi-hat? - Come on. With me, come on. - We're gonna search the house. - No! - You got a search warrant? - Yes, we do. (guns fire) Is this the man in the house? - Yes, it's him. It's Gordon Kahl. - We got a man down! - [Man] He's round up through the back. (guns fire) - Enough of this crap. It's Kahl. Let's go! Here, get these people out of here. (police sirens sound) (shells explode) (Gordon coughs) (Gordon coughs) (Gordon coughs) (house explodes) (calm melancholy music) - How are you doing? - All right. - I heard he killed another officer in Arkansas. - Shot him through a seam in his vest. - Well, at least you got him. And the others are convicted. - I didn't get him alive. I wanted a trial. I wanted a conviction. He wanted to be a martyr. He got what he wanted. - Well, let me get you to that plane. - So, what are your plans now? - Thought I might run for sheriff. - Do. You'd make a good one. - [Narrator] Ben and Sally Hastings were convicted of conspiring to harbor a Federal fugitive. Ben was sentenced to five years in prison. Sally's sentence was suspended. Yorie Kahl and Scott Faul remain in Federal prison. Joan Kahl continues to reside in North Dakota. Robert Cheshire and Ken Muir were the 55th and 56th US Marshals killed in this century. Gene Matthews was the ninth sheriff in the State of Arkansas to be killed in the line of duty. (calm melancholy music) (upbeat music)
