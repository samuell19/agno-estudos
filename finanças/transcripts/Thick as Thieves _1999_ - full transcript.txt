You got 20 minutes. Don't be late. At 9:12, I'm gone. The sign says closed, god dammit! Mackin! What are you doing here? I live here. We were going to take three months off until things cool down. I said two months, and it's been two months. Did you? I thought you said three months. So how are you doing, baby? Did you miss me? Yeah, it's just I thought with all that money you'd be long gone. The money's here, Anne. Where? Outside. It's been here the whole time. It's been so long, baby. So long. - Been saving it for me? - Yeah. The money. Yeah. You know what would be a great idea? If one of us went out and got it. If it's just sitting there, it would be a shame to lose it after three months. - Two months. - Two months. - I'd like to take a shower. - Fantastic. That's a great idea. You get cleaned up and I'll run out and get the money for us. That's a fabulous idea. Let me tell you where it is. You know that oil drum in the alley? - The big, skanky brown one? - The very one. At the bottom of that oil drum is a paint can, a one-gallon paint can. And the money is in that paint can. Paint can! Great! Hurry up, before somebody sees you! What? Thanks a lot. I need a clean-up on aisle four. You're packed. That's a good sign. Just in case. - How's it going? - Good. So what do you think? - Think of what? - This. I think it's a grocery store, frank. I know. It's ours. When did Chicago get in the grocery business? Long story. A guy named hookright. Can you believe that? "Hook-right"? He inherits this chain of grocery stores, 16 of them, from his grandfather or some bullshit like that. Mr. Hookright is what you could call a fuck-up, with major appetites. Gets in deep, comes to us needing 140 large in a hurry, and bada-fuckin'-bing, we're in the grocery business. It's a ball-breaker business, mackin. Grocery stores operate on a margin so small, you need a microscope and a cp-fuckin'-a to see it. This "affordable food for the masses" crap is bleeding us to death. I've grown to hate the American public. See? This is what I'm talking about. Hold on a second. Stop stealing those goddamn peanuts! He drops them back in the bin after he's had his grubby hands all over them. So unsanitary. So what do you need? This guy in Detroit has a line on a printing plant. Food stamps. He says, a quarter-of-a-mill worth. I never did food stamps before. The reason you don't hear about this kind of score every day is that you can always sell food stamps for 50% face on the street and that's way too much exposure. Only grocery stores can turn them into money. I'll need time to check it out, get my guys together, go out there... That's the bad part. It has to go down this weekend. It's labor day, the plant will be closed for three days. The stamps are on site. Tuesday morning, they'll be moved to a state warehouse. I don't like running into these things half-assed, frank. - Help me out on this one, mackin. - I like to have control of the situation. It's a printing plant, for Christ's sake. A cub scout den could take it down. They need you because the stamps are in a building with a steel door and you need a burning bar to pop it. The guy doesn't have anyone who can run a burning bar. How does the money work? You fly to Detroit today, take a look, bust it over the weekend and fly home. Twenty grand, cash, on the spot. Pure fluff. Found money. Okay. I'll go, I'll check it out, but if I don't like it... I'm gone. Thanks, mackin. Your plane leaves in an hour. The guard's gone. Check the perimeter and meet me back here. Yo. Clear. You might want to stand back. Yo, man. Look at that shit. This is it. Let's move 'em out. Yo, man, he's just sugar bear. Don't pay him no mind. So how did it go? It went fine. The merch is in the Van. The Van is in the garage, locked. I sent Danny and little Benny home. Now, Danny thought that I was supposed to pay them. But I told him that you would take care of it. Today. Damn, man. Danny got attitude. He get ill with you? I don't know what that means, but judging from the context, no. You... Owe me some money. It's all good. Pointy's got you covered. Car's in the lot. Red Toyota. Keys under the mat. It's been fun. I'm out of here. I'll leave the car in the long-term parking at the airport. You gonna eat them hash browns? Yeah... Here, you can take your fork back. Shit. - Open the door! - Open slowly. Hands up. Lay face down in the street with your arms wide. Move! - Move those hands and you're dead. - Eat some street, asshole! I'm gonna cuff you. Don't make this hard. Take it easy, pal. You know the drill. Check this out. Pretty good? You want to tell me what this is about, officer? First of all, you're driving a stolen car, mister... Moffit. And you're carrying a large amount of cash. You are one suspicious character, Mr. Moffit. This isn't gonna check out to be talcum powder. And this... this is not good at all. No Miranda... No backup... Somebody tipped you? Pointy tipped you? - So, when are you gonna kill me? - Couple of minutes. Please don't rush us. - Shit, man, you made me lose count. - See what you did? Fuck! - How about you, sir? - Some coffee, please. - Thanks. - No problem. Contact shots. A real big gun, too. Tighten up, Larry. We got work to do. It says your dispatch had no radio transmissions. They were both scheduled off, yesterday and today. Alright, get me a flat-bed. This whole car is going to the lab. - Where's the coffee? - Over there. I'm not trying to be greedy, but where's the sweet potato pie? I can't believe you got rid of the beemer. It had everything. Tinted windows, niche bahn rims, triple-thick paint job and fire engine red, man! I just get teary-eyed, just thinking about this shit. Man, I ain't with that ghetto shit no more. I'm on a smooth renaissance tip. What, a Volvo? What kind of black man drives a Volvo? A black man who appreciates safety. Shit, this bad boy got side airbags, kid. I get in an accident? It's all good. Straighter than straight. Your burger's ready, baby. We got any dijon, ma? Dijon? We got yellow mustard, baby. You have to suffer with the rest of us common folk. Dink, man, what you doing here? You're interrupting my family time. Trouble. The thief killed the cops. God damn! Sorry, mama. Damn, mackin, I know your ass must be in hot water if you're taking the bus. Yeah. - So? How hot are you? - I'm alright, now. Bo said you ran into some trouble. I had to kill two cops. The shuttle to Chicago O'Hare airport will leave in 15 minutes. Well, it looks like the cops ran into the trouble. So what have you got? They were both dirty. We've been investigating them for three months. Cheapjack stuff, mostly. We're gonna put it in front of the grand jury next month. So? - What do you guys got? - Checking out some leads. Maybe a witness seeing a car leave the scene. Nothing promising. Two dead cops. You got a big one, Louise. - When are you on? - Fifteen minutes. The print people have a deadline. Alright, I'm gonna get some more coffee. Want some? No, I get my coffee on the outside. You guys in internal affairs... High-falutin' bunch! You betcha! Welcome home. Good to be home. Where's my boy? He's outside in the street, playing. There he is. He's shedding all over the place. Hey! Let me look at you. My god. Did you miss me? Did you miss me, Wally? Did he eat good? As well as a 15-year-old dog can. He's in bad shape. Yeah, I figured. Did he take his pills? Yeah, he hates them. He bit me. I'm gonna take my boy home... Brush his teeth... bet you didn't brush his teeth all weekend. Right! I didn't brush my teeth all weekend. Hey. I thought you liked this kind. This is... "Poultry flavor." We can't do shit with those stamps. And the Italians sure as shit don't want 'em now. Shit. Player on ball seven. Two-fifty in stamps, gone! Fuck it. Lose 'em, dink. If I catch that fucking thief, I'm gonna shoot him up 250,000 goddamn times. Player on ball eight. I don't get why you did it, pointy. - Did what? - Tried to shake down the thief. He goes home pissed off, calls riles, we got the fuckin' Italians all over our ass. No percentage for us. He wasn't supposed to go home, dink. I figured it was a good way to pay off the cops without it coming out of my butt. Twenty grand, though? Don't seem like much, for all the bullshit we got to deal with, now. Thank you for the 20-20 hindsight. Check it. Two cops, with guns... Should have been able to take out one goddamn thief. Fools went to the police academy and shit. They should know how to operate a goddamn firearm. I had some logic to this shit, dink. Stop second-guessing my ass. Well, the cops be crying over Kendall and McNamara. You ought to get out of town for a while, let that shit die down. Plus, I need to make arrangements with the Italians on this. Game over. It's gonna cost us. Set it up. I'll take Cassandra to Miami for a week or two. You'll be alright? Yeah, I'll handle it. Is there something else you can give him? There must be something you can do. I can give him painkillers, but I can't keep giving 'em to him forever. I think it might be time to think about what we talked about, earlier. - No. I'm not ready, yet. - I know. But it's him you have to think about, and it's not going to get any easier. I'm not going to let him suffer. I just need to work this whole thing out. I understand. - You got a phone I could use? - Sure. It's right behind you. Local? Yeah. Take your time. - Riles. - Mackin. I had no idea. I thought Williams was a straight-up guy. If you want, he'll be dead tomorrow morning. I'll take care of him. Something I'd like to deal with personally. Yeah, how? I've got to go back and see pointy. Try to work this thing out. I will need information. If you could help with that I'd appreciate it. Whatever you need, let me know. Good. Just lay low, right? Wait for this cop thing to cool out. Ok? Alright. This is a pain in my narrow black ass. Pointy will be on the beach, too, chilling with that fine-ass bitch. Man, I think she got some Indian in her. Like cherokee or sasquatch, or some shit like that. Want to talk to you downtown, Reeves. Where's your warrant at? Behind that preposition. - What? - Learn some grammar. You can't end a sentence with a preposition. Then... Where's your warrant at, motherfucker? Want me to get out of this car? 'Cause I will get out of this car, take my stick, and wear your ass out. It's not a problem, officer. No problem. I'm not saying a word until my lawyer gets here. He's on his way. We got a little problem here, dink. We know Kendall and McNamara were working for you. Now they're dead. We thought, maybe you could help us out. - Hello, Louise. - Hi, Ralph. Detective tenesco. What seems to be the problem here? Your client had a relationship with the two detectives killed this weekend. - We're hoping he can help us out. - I see. We just want to talk, Ralph. My client assures me that he has absolutely no knowledge about the death of the two detectives. In the absence of any charges, we'll be leaving. Thanks for your help, Ralph. - No problem, Louise. - See you, dink. Why don't you hire somebody to help you, sal? You'll hurt your back. I couldn't hire somebody to help me hook up a VCR, honey! Anybody should be able to do this. - Well, let frank help you. - Yeah, let me help. - Here, let me see that. - That goes into the left channel. This is all for the surround sound. That one goes to the antenna. There's a problem, sal. - Need the owner's manual? - No. The food stamps score. Apparently, Williams tried to rip off the thief and it all went to hell. Now they're blaming each other. Williams is greedy, Francis. Greedy people make mistakes. Hold it! Hold it there. There's a video of little sal, practicing his t-ball game. Gonna have that in stereo, now. Right. Here's what you do. Give the thief what he wants. We owe him that because he has been our friend. Then you call Mr. Pointy Williams, and ask him to make a gesture to us, because of the stamps. Not the whole thing, of course. Just a token. For our pride. Finish up, ray. We're through. Here! Here's my favorite part! Hit him right in the balls! - Hey, ray, take a look at this. - How do you put that on hold? It's very funny. So, this is it. The absolute best we have available. Brochure says there's a babbling brook. I don't hear any... Babbling. It hasn't rained in a while. After rain... it babbles. Is it quiet, here? The highway is far enough away, so... You can't even hear it. As you can see, it's... It's beautiful here. We like to think of ourselves as... The absolute best pet cemetery in the mid-west. We'll go toe-to-toe with human cemeteries in terms of location. Maybe this is the place. See? I think that was a yes. I think that was a bark. I'm not so far gone I think my dog speaks English. Okay. We'll take it. We'll take it. Hurry up, pointy. Damn! I'm bored. If I'd known I'd spend my trip on a golf course, I would have kept my ass at home. - Calm down. - Mr. Williams! The food's ready, anyway. Agh! Buenos dias. Fresh from our restaurant. - Would you like to charge it to your room? - Yes, yes. Smells good. I own a French restaurant, you know. The best French restaurant in motown, straight up. I can tell from your choice of dishes that you have very fine taste. Well, my good man, if you are ever in Detroit, come by vingt-et-un. Ask for pointy. Thank you, sir. Lord, please bless this food. Thank you for the nourishment of... What the fuck are you doing? Don't snort that shit while I'm saying my praises to the lord. You want us both to go straight to hell? For what? What commandments am I violating? I'll tell you what commandment. "Thou shalt stop acting like a blaspheming bitch." God damn! No home training. Shit... Take the bitch out the ghetto, but... You can't take the bitch out the ghetto! Yo, what's up, dink? It's me. You called hot sauce? Yeah, I know I'm supposed to lay low, but look, I've been working on this for six months and the deal's got to go down now. It's some high grade Peruvian shit, man. Wholesale prices, baby. The samples alone have been wearing me and Cassandra out. Just... Yo, just handle it. What, I got to do everything? Cash is in the safe. You are so country. Man, this shit is ridiculous. A nigga who offers to sell you four kilos for the price of three is probably not a good nigga. Who we meeting with, again? Some silly motherfucker named hot sauce. See what I'm saying? How you gonna do serious business with some project nigga who calls himself hot sauce? Sugar bear? Danny, get out and go round the back. - What the fuck! - What the fuck? - So what's this all about? - Where's the cash? You ain't crazy enough to think you can fuck with pointy Williams and survive? Just give us the shit, we'll give you the cash. Where's pointy? Where the fuck is pointy? Pointy Williams don't handle bullshit like this himself. He's trying to figure out how many pieces to leave your momma in if you try to fuck with him on this. So... - Where's the coke? - Coke's in your fucking mind, bitch. Question is, where's the cash? Be careful with that. A lot of guns in this room. Sauce, look out! What's your problem, boy? Sugar bear... sugar bear! Son of a bitch popped a cap next to my motherfucking ear, man. Shit. I can't hear shit, man! Motherfucker, what's your problem, boy? Sorry I took so long. I think I stepped on a hypodermic needle or something. You did great. They were gonna do us, sure as shit. - You did great, man. - Motherfucker! Look at you now, boy. Catch it, now! Catch it, motherfucker. Punk! Am I bleeding? I don't know, man. You're covered in that shit, but I think most of it's his. - Your head ain't bleeding. - Ok, we got to move fast. Danny, go start the car. Put the shotgun in your jacket, man! Come on! Come on, sugar. You hear me? Sugar, you hear me? I hear you. It's just one side. Okay. Get their wallets, guns, whatever. Come on. Stop fucking around. Let's get out of here. Look at you now, punk. I don't suppose there's anything I can say that would convince you to let this thing lie for a while, is there? Bo, I'm going tomorrow. If you don't want to come, don't come. No, I'll go. And I'll call Rodney, he'll probably go. But nobody's going to tell you it's the most professional thing. Hey. We go tomorrow. I got no trouble believing that, let me tell you, frank. Hey, the man was lucky he got clear. Fucking spade will kill you as soon as look at you, believe me. Absolutely, frank. You give my respects to sal. Tell him the stuff he sent for the roses works great. Ellen is thrilled. Okay, you too, frank. That was frank. Yeah, I heard. So what's he need from us? Frank wants us to put together everything we can find on William's operation. Find out where he keeps the cars before he ships them to New York. A warehouse on the highway frontage road. He leases it from us. Well, hell, I knew that. You put together a list of that shit and get it to frank tomorrow morning, ok? I got a feeling that by this time next week, Mr. Pointy Williams is gonna have a full-time job covering his own ass! I... declare... So that's the deal. There's money up there, and I'm gonna go and get me some. Are you in or are you out? - I'm in. - What about you? In or out? I'm in like Flynn. I got this addiction to money I just can't seem to shake. I... declare... war! You suck, man! So what? You beat me at this little card game. Congratulations. Let's see you beat me in a real sport. What I want to know is, is there a problem here? Bo bragging that he can beat me in this card game? - That shit's 100 percent luck. - No. I'm talking about pointy being black. So what? If I come to you 'cause the guy who's fucking with me is white am I going to ask you the same thing? Pointy Williams ain't never did shit for me. Fuck him. Fuck you, too. Are we partners or what? Yeah. One hundred percent. - You still suck at war, man. - Fuck you! What do you got for me, Lou? A witness identified a red Toyota leaving the scene. We found an abandoned car downtown that matched the description. Bloody clothes in the trunk. Any prints? Not on the car. No prints on the casings, not even smears. The guy wipes his shells before he fills his magazine. He's a pro. Did find a thumbprint on a cassette in the tape deck. I had sid run a trace through the ncic but the database is down so it may take a while. - Anything else? - Yeah, that tape. It's a jazzy, scatty kind of thing. What about it? It's good. Mana-mana Dee Dee, Dee-Dee mana-mana Dee-Dee, bee-Dee-bee, bee-Dee-bee... Damn. What's wrong? A scratch. It's really little. But it's there. You see? See? I see it. I wouldn't worry about that one. I mean, it's in between tracks. Well, it's the really little ones that get under my skin, for some reason. I'll give you ten percent off. For having the eagle eye. That's the best I can do. I don't know. Fine. If you think you can find astrud Gilberto and Walter wanderly on an album together, in better condition, then go for it. It's a good point. - Hello? - Mackin. - Hey. - I'm right up the road. A place called the circle seven motel. Room 116. - You want to hook up tonight? - Nah. I'll meet you guys for breakfast over there. Say, nine o'clock? Cool. We're tired. Whoa, whoa... "We"? I brought the dog. I'll see you tomorrow. He brought the dog. Yo, dink. There's a dude with a gun in the alley. Who is he? Um... could be, he's working for thief. Could be, he's part of that crew we danced with at the towers. I'm so tired of the drama. Unlock the hallway door. And when he comes through, you put his ass to sleep. Pointy will want to talk to him. Yeah, when is pointy coming back? Plane gets here tomorrow morning. That's good. Won't be so many people. Traffic around the airport's a bitch. So, I'm sure you got a perfect explanation for bringing your dog on this joyride, mackin. Yes, I do. He's on his last legs. I've got to put him to sleep next week. Man... I want to spend some quality time with the dog. Man, we can't have your mind on a dog. We've got some serious business to do. It's not quality time anyway, man. Look. The fuckin' dog is sitting there, eating scrambled eggs. That's that man's dog. If he says it's quality time... - You ain't never had a fuckin' dog. - No, I've had a dog. I've had a dog. - I didn't take my dog to a hotel room... - Gentlemen, gentlemen. Let's get back to business. I want to do the black hole. Tonight. Alright. I'll check it out this afternoon. Yo, man. Pointy's in. He's acting kind of weird. What you doing? Man, this nigga's got, like, five little pieces of cloth on his desk. Just staring at them shits. What up, pointy? What you doing, man? Checking out these swatches. What? Swatches, man. Sample pieces of cloth, so you can figure out what fabric to cover your furniture in. Thinking of doing that sofa over there in... Straw-colored ragoon. So, what's going on around here? Well, let's see. As you know, we almost got our heads blown off at walnut towers. The thief is supposed to be on his way back here, and... Yeah, some nigga I never seen before climbed the fire escape. - So we had to knock his ass out. - What? Yeah, he's waiting for you in the storage closet. Welcome home. Let's go see the nigga in the closet. Shit, man. That's Malcolm Steele, the nigga that set up the deal at the towers, man. - I thought y'all killed him. - Killed everyone there. He wasn't there. Let me talk to this motherfucker. Fuck you, pointy! You fucked with the wrong motherfucker. I'm from Gary, bitch. We don't... You from Gary? Let me tell you where I'm from. A little place called "fresh off a nigga's ass." And you just made me homesick. Malcolm, Malcolm, Malcolm... You stupid motherfucker, you. Wasn't bad enough that you sent all your people to get killed. Now you got to come down here and die your damn self. Shit... Tell me, man, who was it that we killed at towers? So important that you had to come down here? A brother? Well... Your brother fucked up, kid. Now the nigga's dead. So why don't you just... Enjoy your last few moments here, marinating in your own juices? While me and my people figure out, you know, what to do with your corpse. After that, I'll come back and kill you personally, alright? 'Night, John-boy. Don't open it here, Nick. I photocopied parts of seven different files. Everything in that folder has been cleared for use, background only, by the chief. This conversation is also background only. Deep background. No direct quotes. Attribution to "departmental sources close to the investigation," whatever you guys write. Photographs, you can print once you run the story. - What is the story? - Don't make me run the whole thing. Trust me, it's unpleasant enough to make you very happy. How long do I have to wait? A week would be beautiful. We have an officer undercover. No, I can't wait a week. Martians could land on the white house lawn in a week. Would you cut me some slack? I'm being good to you. Like I haven't been good to you, Louise? Come on, what about the pawnshop thing? I'm not trying to keep score. But if we're going to talk about tips, I've got a few coming to me. I'm aware of that. Why do you think I'm here? I just need a week, Nick. Alright. Pleasure doing business with you, friend. You know, every time we get together, it's always business. Wouldn't hurt you to have me over to your house for dinner. Yeah, it would. But I'm telling you, though, Claude, man, when I was down in south beach... That lyonnais calf sweetbread was très, très... Good. Wouldn't be so bad if we had something like that here. So, I'm supposed to follow the Cubans? They're experts in French food, now? Hey, hey, man. I'm not saying all that. I'm just... Look, man, I'm not trying to mess with your culinary artistry, man. I'm just throwing out suggestions and whatnot. Come on, man. You're my man. Best chef in motown, no doubt. Fine, Peter. Come on, Claude, don't get upset, man. I need you here, man. If another restaurant came out and tried to steal you away from me, I don't know what I would do. I'd probably kill you, I'd be so jealous. Man, Claude! Come on, man, I'm only kidding, man! Claude, man, come here. You're my man. Alright? You cool? Alright, man. But you know, don't leave me. Alright. I'll check you later. Alright? - Ms. Kayhill. - Thank you. Did you miss me as much as I missed you? Mr. Williams. How was Florida? Pretty good. Would have been better if you had come along. You're kind of here... a little early. Just checking the schedule. So... You coming by, this evening? No, baby. I can't. I've got business. But I'll see you a little later. Alright, now? Whoa! Hey! Shut the music off now! Down on the floor! Get down! Get down! Everybody down! Shut the fuck up! You! Get your fuckin' hands up! Let's go. Empty the cash register, now. Down, down! Get down, you! Shut the fuck up. Down! Let's go, big man. - Turn around. - Be cool, sugar. Over here, against the bar, let's go. Spread 'em. The safe. What safe? Empty it. Let's go. Out! Everybody stay down! Want the coins, too? So you're the thief? We gonna kill you, thief. Sugar, please shut the fuck up. So we're even now? I'll think about that. Tell pointy Williams I said hey. We have people outside. If you try to leave, we will kill you! Thank you for your time. I think Phil is fucked up. Are you out of your fuckin' mind? What did you kill the poor bastard for? We didn't kill anybody. Bo, the guy's not dead. Take it easy. Go ahead and show him. It's a hand load. So? I don't get it. Convincers, man. Less than half the normal powder charge. Right? No shot. No shot? Something hit that poor son of a bitch. Rock salt. Stings like a motherfucker but it ain't going to kill nobody. Thanks for telling me. By the way, how did we do? The cash in here is mostly 20s. I don't know, there's maybe 20, 25 grand in here. Can you move your seat forward? Mackin. So how far is this going to go, mackin? - He tried to kill me, frank. - I know. Look... Sal's been asking questions about this. I'd like to get this wrapped up. I've got no wish to mess up anything for you guys. This is between me and pointy Williams. I understand that. But if you can be nice and snappy with this whole revenge bit it would really help us out. Alright, frank. Bye. Good news, Louise? Found a thumbprint matching our cassette. Left at the scene of a bank robbery in Atlanta, four years ago. An insurance investigator who worked the case is faxing me a police sketch. Based on a guard's ID from the Atlanta robbery. See how it matches up with our police sketch from the black hole. Yep. I think that's our guy. Dink. Hey. So, I want my kilo. I'm ready to go. Can't, baby. Nobody's getting anything but the major players. Maybe next month. Has to be cool until then. Yeah, well, the thief is cutting into my shit, now. I'm about getting paid, know what I'm saying? I understand. - Coffee. Black. - That's what I'm holding. - Keep it. - Thank you very much. I want this thing to be over with the thief. What you have, Ricky? Circle seven, room 116, garden city. He ain't gonna be there much longer. Give me a call tomorrow. You can pick up your kilo then. Alright, dink! Now that's what I pay your black ass for! Listen up, kid. I got something for you. It is a damn shame to see such fine automobiles like these destroyed. Damn! Not when those automobiles belong to pointy Williams. Set. Look here, you take them other two fools. I got the thief. Hey, Rodney, see if those windows open. It's getting kind of thick in here. Alright. Psst! Company. Shit. Nice to see you again, Benny. Alright. Let's hit it. Hey, next time you see Mr. Pointy Williams, you tell him, now it's over. Yo, man, sounds like he's in there. Alright, look here. We ain't gonna fuck around with knocking on the damn door. I saw what this dude can do at the black hole. Best way to deal with his ass is to knock down the door and light his ass up. Yo, man, I think we hit somebody. Check it out. I'm checking the toilet. - Damn, man. - Clear. Yo, we killed his dog, man. That's some seriously fucked-up shit. - What's your fuckin' problem, man? - I had a dog when I was a kid. It looked just like that one. I'm feeling all bad and shit. I bet this will get that thief's attention. Yo, we already had his attention, man. Come on, let's go. Man, I haven't done anything like that in a long time. Well, we need to think about getting out of Detroit. You down, mackin? We're done here. They got Wally. What? Yo, man, a cop is here. She ain't got no warrant, though. Want me to send her ass up? Yeah. Mr. Williams? Detective petrone. I'm glad you're here. I hope you got some leads on those gentlemen who robbed my club. I'm not here for that. I'm working the Kendall-McNamara case. Didn't you already go through this dog and puppet show with my man, dink? Actually, I thought you might want to see something interesting on TV. Should be on, right about now. Channel 18. This afternoon, the police suspect arson in the burning of that warehouse on highway 45. The warehouse was full of high-end automobiles, all burned beyond recognition. We will follow this story with more information as it becomes... I'm sorry, did you say something? I saw your lips move but I didn't hear anything. Well, then I'll speak clearly so you can understand me. Fuck you. Whatever that shit was has nothing to do with me. Alright pointy, let's stop bullshitting, okay? I know it's the thief. I know he took down the black hole, I know you set him up with the cops, I strongly suspect he just burned down that warehouse, which, if the trail is right, was full of cars you stole. Well, if you know so damn much, then arrest me. Let me explain, pointy. I don't give a shit about you. I don't care whether you go to jail, stay free, live or die. Your some other cop's problem. I'm working the Kendall-McNamara case. I want the thief. What you want from me? Information. I'm assuming you don't want to incriminate yourself, so take a couple of days. Think about how you would carefully word what you say to me. And I'll be visiting you soon. There ain't nothing to get out of me. I'm just a... humble restaurant owner. Alright. Bye, Mr. Williams. Goddamn you, bastard! My motherfuckin' caddy! Goddamn it! Hey, mackin, he was a cool little dog, man. Sorry, man. Look, I'm not going to explain to you the scope of my relationship with the dog because if I do, the words are going to sound fuckin' stupid coming out of my mouth! Shit! Okay, man. We understand you. I mean, now is a time for thinking. We need to be thinking about getting out of here before things get worse. Things are going to get a lot worse for a certain dog-killer. Mackin, you were going to put him to sleep anyway. It was a dog, okay? We don't want to die over a dog, for Christ's sake. Well, we're not going to be the ones doing the dying. Williams' people sent 10,000 cash for the printing plant thing. It's not much. But it's a gesture. "The possibility that the violence is linked to the Chicago mob... Said to be headed for more than a decade by sal capetti, was labelled 'sheer speculation' by the Chicago FBI office, as were reports that the investigation would act as a catalyst to revive the midwest organized crime strike force, currently slated to be disbanded next month." It must end now, Francis. Ten years, I've taken care of our business. And never once have those parasites at the justice department come close to me. To us. Now, in a week, everything goes to hell. I see my name back in the newspapers, connected with a food stamp heist. Food stamps, for Christ's sake! Knock it off, Marie! You're skinny enough as it is. What's our exposure? On paper, nothing. The feds can subpoena the whole world. All they'll find is that hookright sold 51% of consolidated to a real estate investment company for 141,000 dollars. That's what all the papers say. And the rest of the real estate people are clean, so... There's nothing written down that indicates who really controls the company. But this Mr. Hookright knows, am I right? Sort of, I guess. Hookright was so coked up, who knows what he remembers? But yeah, he knows, he did the deal with me personally, even if he doesn't really know how much control he gave up, and that's not good. Seven, eight years ago, all my people wanted to be John gotti. - Sal, turn down the thermostat! - Shit. Except you, of course, Francis. You have always understood. But the young men, they all wanted to work for a teflon Don. Because they all wanted to be teflon dons. Where's gotti, now? Who's taking care of gotti's people, now? I don't want to be brought down like that, Francis. I tell you this formally: It must end. The thief must go home. No more newspaper stories. Ho capito. I'll take care of it. Richardson party? Right this way. Thank you. Hi, pointy. Hang on one second. Maybe the thief left town. Ricky don't know where he is. Well, if at first you don't succeed, get out the motherfuckin' kitchen. Just tell Ricky to try harder. Promise him something. Shit, nigga, do I have to do all the thinking round here? I get it. Don't mind me, miss. I'm here to see the owner. Mr. Williams, I need to talk to you. It's cool. Wait here ten minutes, no more. If I'm not out in ten minutes, go home. This is fucked, mackin. You don't even know if he's in there. If he's in there we need to wait for him to come out, do him outside. Bam! You ain't thinking, dude. I'm tired of fucking around with this guy! He's in there. I can smell him. Now, I go in there, I kill him, I come out, we go home. Alright, pointy. Report on my desk this morning said a motel got machine-gunned in garden city last night a dog got gunned down. One of yours? I don't know shit about no dog, alright? I don't know shit about no fire, I don't know shit about no cars, I don't know shit about birthing babies. I don't know shit about shit. What's up? He just walked in. Motherfucker! Freeze, sugar bear! Police! Drop the gun! Freeze! Freeze! Fuck this. Let's go! Let's go! Clear, sergeant. Clear. Alright. Officer Hassan. Vingt-et-un restaurant, downtown. We need backup and paramedics, now. I was talking to riles. He wants to sit down, today. Some place called momo amusement on the West Side. Says Williams will be there. No guns. Give me the address. I'll take a cab. You guys should go home. No. Fuck that. Riles said he'd bring one guy to the meet. He figures it will be Rodney 'cause he knows I like to be the outside guy. Probably means he's not going to kill me right away. - I'll go alone. - The fuck, you will! I got a scoped .227 herret in the trunk. It'll take the nuts off a bear at 300m. Anybody messes with you, they'll be dead. Let's do the sit-down, make this right, then go home. How about it, Rodney? Gone this far. I understand. Right. No, I'm taking care of everything. Yeah. Tenth floor penthouse. I'll wait here. Yeah? Wayne hookright? Yeah, that's me. Who is it? Of all the times I had to draw my weapon this is the first time I ever fired it off the range. No shit. You hit a clock. Hassan was solid, right? Are you kidding? Two shots at an armed target. Both inside the kill ring. You could cover the entrance with a coaster. I'll take that any day. She's going to fly through that hearing. Don't worry about her. Okay. Don't forget these. The paperwork I've got to do, Jesus! No wonder I never shoot my gun. Hey, leave that rifle in the case, my friend. A cop comes by, tell him you were hunting in Arkansas. If something goes down it's going to take forever to get a shot. Nothing's going to go down, Bo. Riles knows that you're out there, somewhere, watching. The last thing he wants is you following him all the way back to Chicago. Let's go. Keys! All set, Mr. Riles. I know about your side bet with dink Reeves, Ricky. I don't really have a problem with that. Macchi is a great old guy, but... Maybe not the best guy to work for if you want to make money, am I right? I haven't done nothing to screw you over, Mr. Riles. I ain't stole nothing, honest to god. Take it easy, Ricky. I believe you. I mean, hell... If I didn't believe that, ray would have put a cap in you when you walked in. What I don't know is whether or not you were the guy that gave Williams the circle seven motel. The only place in town with the thief's number was right here. And I'm pretty sure Joe didn't give it up. So I got to admit, I wondered if maybe... Mr. Riles, maybe I did some business with dink on some stuff, but that's all. I don't want to know if you gave Williams the motel. If you gave him the motel I'd probably have to whack you. Instead, what I'm going to do is let bygones be bygones. That's the whole problem, here. No one wants to let go of the past. Well, I'm letting go of the past, Ricky. Because guys like you and me... We have to worry about the future. Am I right? Yes, sir. That's the thief and his man. Let them in. Pat them down. Pointy will be here in a minute. He's just getting a haircut. You're about 200 pounds of bad news? If it makes any difference, you're way ahead on this whole thing. The warehouse hit, it hurt bad. I figured I was way ahead when I got out of that cop car without a bullet in my head. Let's wait for pointy. We'll get it worked out. - Is he clean? - He's clean. Now Ray's gonna make sure you're clean, you're gonna sit down, and we're going to work this out. Goddamn, man, you hit a nut! Let's get this shit started. Now, I've lost beaucoup... of money because of this fool. And for those of y'all who don't know, that's French for "a whole motherfuckin' lot." Now, what I want to know is how the Italians are going to make all this shit right. That's why we're here. To make it right. - That's what I've been trying to do. - No. What you've been doing is making a lot of noise. We didn't give a shit as long as you did it quickly and professionally. Kill him, Rob him, do whatever, then get the fuck out. Instead, you set the whole goddamn town on fire. And you. You set up my man here, tried to get him killed, for what? For 20,000 dollars? We're trying to set up major business in this town and you're nickel-and-diming it away. What are you thinking of? So, everybody's fucked up but the Italians! Don't nobody got their shit together but the hoods in Chicago. Alright... We're having a conversation here. So what's it going to take to make everything right with you? Shit, you got a calculator? A calculator? No. Anybody here got a calculator? Here. How about this? See? There's a better way to handle our business. So you're giving me lessons, now? Alright. Now, I'm going to hand you over this figure. And I want you to show me how you Italians make things right and handle your business. What? I want to keep it. It's a really good pen. - So? - So, nothing. It's over. Who's running things in the brickyard, now? Don't care. I just know who's not running things in the brickyard, now. I'm gone. The man from Chicago says... It's over. That good for you? Ray. Go get the car, please. Ricky. For now, I want you to wait outside. When we're done here... Clean this up. Can I have a minute, mackin? I'll be outside. I'm really sorry about your dog. Wally, right? Yeah. Why didn't you leave him in the kennel? I don't know. What's wrong? You alright? You got what you wanted. Yeah, but... But I wanted to do it myself. You kill the guy all of a sudden, like that. It's not... It's not what? Fulfilling? You need to think of a sport or something. I belong to this softball league. Our team meets every third sunday. Come out. We lost our second baseman. He got busted. He's doing three to five. What do you say? I never played softball before. That's okay. We'll start you in the outfield. Yo, dink. That fire escape dude is... Still in the storage closet. I think we better ought to, you know, kill him. Or give him some crackers or something. Where's pointy? - Pointy's dead. - Shit! You serious? Bring fire escape in here. Keep his arms tied. Take off his gag. What up? Your lips are cracked like a motherfucker. Danny, get this nigga some chapstick. Pointy Williams killed your brother. And today, somebody killed pointy. I'm not going to apologize for your brother 'cause your brother fucked up. But I need to know where we stand. Look, my beef's with pointy Williams. That nigga's dead? I'm beefless. That's a ballsy play, kid. Climbing up the fire escape. You straighten up, fly right, maybe we'll find a place for you. You looking for work? I don't know. You got benefits? Yeah, you get to live! You are one ugly dog. So Sarah, this comes from your restaurant? Yeah. I call it orgy of lentils. All organic, mostly vegan. Pretty tasty? I was hoping to have seconds. He's buttering you up, Sarah. After this he's heading for a steak. Well I hope it's a really bloody one. They should just kill the cow at your table so you can enjoy the agony. You know, like they do with lobsters. - I get this every night, Nick. - Well, it's delicious. Worth the wait. You know how long it took to get an invite over here? Well, Louise likes to keep me in the dark about everything she's doing, so... Nick, I can only imagine. - How about some artichoke pie? - Certainly. I'll even give you the recipe. That's really good. Really enjoying that, Nick?
