The law suit of businessman Genna Sorkin has lasted for half a year. We still remember Genna Sorkin, the president of an integrated oil company was accused of tax evasion. The amount is more than 8 million US dollars. It is needed to conduct investigation and evidence collection for Genna Sorkin's arbitrage from the Peace and Safety Social Foundation. We have enough evidences to prove Genna Sorkin is guilty. What we need is to find out the direct evidence and every witness who knows about him. And we are working on that. Here you are at last! It's my fault. Put it on. wait for a moment. Sorry. hurry up, or we will be caught up. they found him yesterday. But they were not sure. They kept an eye on there all night. Where is he now? In a room. He went in an hour ago. Hope he won't disappear as he did last time. I don't think so. The two crossings have been guarded. He may probably be sleeping. I want to sleep for a while too Watch out! You are working alone. There is no information from local government. I don't have time to wait for them Stand by for action as soon as everyone is here. Wish you good luck. We have gathered all the people within an area of 2, 000 miles around Malta. I see. How many people in total? Seven, Vladimir Malkovich Is there anyone watching Sharik's house? Not known yet. When can you make clear of that? When 70 people attack 7 ones? We have just known that as well. What do you want to say? Miracle. Dmitry Alekseevich. What else could it be? < MAN OF EAST > What are you waiting for? One of us Own people can sit at home and eat pancakes, is it suitable for strangers? Sometimes strangers are closer than family. Please come in. you are the guest. Take the bullets away respectively. Hey, man, you are still with a shield. Is it a bullet hole? Thank goodness. Why he didn't protect your men in Columbia? I will tell you later. Say it. There are various versions. Some one said it's an accident. And some one said you kill them. Lech Barking, Still remember? He is my buddy. Boss, it's wrong. Give me one more cartridge clip. Don't forget to save one bullet for yourself. Just in case. It seems that we are going to fail. What do you wear? A pox on you! They are wearing talisman for success.There are 10 bullet holes in their clothes, but none of them is a medal. I don't think we need so many. This is for you. Is it a protection? It's an escort. Escort means not a hair of his will be touched. Are you clear? Long time no see. It's an unexpected meeting. Listen to me, I am Yegor Ivanovic Your buddy, Lech Barking, is as boring as you. So he was shot. Because of him, my men are all dead. Got it? No. 1 , Come in. Do you copy? You don't have to answer. No. 1 , Come in. Do you copy? No. 1 Copy that. Attention! Target 3 is driving into Deborah Street. Don't lose him. Attention! Don't lose the target. Here is the target. Attention, here is the target. Stand by. Why are you so slow? Do you copy? Where are you going? Is anybody there? Who is alive? Do you copy? My fingers! My fingers! Listen, this is a mistake. I am Gani Fusca, a free enterpriser. This is a mistake. Listen, joke is over. Speak your native tongue, clear? Damn it, what language did you just say? Which language are you more familiar with Russian or Hebrew? You'd better say Russian, or you will be dead. Sharik Mikhail Don't be rude. Nice try. What are you doing, barbarians? Do you know how much the house costs? I don't know. There is only one room in my house. Wait here! Hurry up! Get into the car! What are you doing now? Put your seat belt on! Oh, damn it! Is this investigation? Aren't you good at making pins? I have no idea why did Schuck Tank lie there? This is your business. I have nothing to do with it. You are not investigators. You are poor fools. Take it easy. Monia. Then you tell me, who set up the shiny thing under the window with you? What are those smart kids in the jeep? I don't know. That's it. You are the secret unit. I look down upon you and I don't trust you. I warn you, I won't go anywhere. I am going to scream and fight back. Go ahead. I see. Briefly, we have to wait one or two more days. They've hit the bottom. It will go up a week later. And then buy it again. We will own everything. Listen to me, Lech, we will still curse it. Why do you treat me like that, you bastard? Goodbye! Help me, help me. It's me, Klemmenev. Why it's you, Klemmenev? Couldn't be anyone else! What do you mean? Here is it. We are surrounded by the attackers. They all died, except me. How about the escorted one? I'm not sure. He was still alive 5 minutes ago. What do you mean 5 minutes ago? Answer my question. Nikola Gorkievic Why do you threat the terrified man? I don't own you anything. I want to retrieve my honor. I failed twice within a year. What other people will think of me? I am excellent. I give you a name. Figure it out yourself. Sorkin I don't understand. Idiot! Why can he enjoy himself in Alps? Instead of some places in Magadan Because there is no solid evidence against him No evidence. You are right, Klemmenev. You have the evidence, the living one. We have to talk it over. Don't cry any more. Nod if you understand. They ordered me to protect you. Face me. Let me have a look at you. Your book dropped. I don't suggest you to do that. I can't catch you. But the bullet can. But you said you were going to protect me. It's the same for me whether to protect a living or a dead. Although I have known everything about you, it's still OK if you die. What are they now? Klemmenev didn't say. He declared that he didn't trust anyone. He would act without authorization. He has gone too far. I have to report to the boss. I have a plan B I gave Solerdorf's telephone number to Klemmenev. If he wants to do without authorization he has to call Solerdorf. No one picks up. It's great. It means we may live for a few more days. You'd better watch your ass or you have to hang yourself. But I think it's much better than hitting the car. It's late. The car is coming towards you. Towards you too. You just didn't feel it because you are cheeky. You are going to hear the sounds when your bone crashed. And you are going to hear soon. And then you will know that you are killed by your rotten country. Do you know who you are talking to, Monia? I am not a piece of trash, and l am not a law guard you buy either. I am an outsider. I will applaud for you on another occasion. That's a warning. Let's go. The car is stolen. Damn it. It's half past eleven. I should have breakfast an hour ago. Adjust yourself to the new conditions. It's time for lunch in jail. I have a stomach ulcer. Hey, come here. Wish you a good appetite. I tell you, the National Security Guard, stomach ulcer is a dangerous disease. If it attacks, maybe you will really protect a dead man. But your officer may not like it. What's this? I tell you what, I don't drink. And I don't suggest you to drink. Take up your glass. I have already said. You will drink if you take it up. Enjoy it. How about finding a big glass and then taking you to the bathroom to pour it in? There is nothing to eat. How about Golden Helmet? It is made of turtle. I suggest. It's very delicious. No more suggestion, please. OK. Two Golden Helmet. Two? Why? It means you eat it too. I don't know who you are, protector or attendant? But skinny and hunger are no good for us. Give me a bowl of noodle. Alright, one golden helmet. Yes. I have never thought about having lunch in such an inn. I will give you five starts. Do you think I am qualified? The judge will tell you what you are qualified for. The judge, yes, I think I will finally know what I am accused of. Drink it. Your pals want to seize the power. You mean Genna Sorking is the president. And I am his right hand. Maybe his foot. He has tow social foundations. Some people remitted large sum of money from the west to the account of foundation through fake company. And he used this money to buy officers, senators, soldiers and Special Forces. He has been busy with oil and gas all his life. He has enough money. No one will do this in western countries. You mean the CIA Yes. He is the emissary of Western Special Forces And the organizers of the domestic power behind-the-scenes. And you are with him. If I say your superior needs me for another reason not for our country. They don't do this for reunifying the motherland. Anyway, you won't believe this. Save me, please! Save me! Who can help me? He is a Russian robber. Call the police, who can help me? Call the police, please help me. Ladies and gentles, I am really sorry My friend just got a little drunk. Take it easy and relax. There is nothing wrong. Call the police, please. I am a good citizen of Malta. Do you want to hit me? On the contrary, I want to thank you. Why? Thank you for reminding. There will be a hypocritical feature on every channel half an hour later. Have you ever seen your own feature? You can be more humane. To tell you the truth, I feel like I am a ballet dancer in a collective farm when I am in Russia What do you think? Let's make a deal. I will pay you money if you let me go A lot? Not a lot, it is much more than "a lot". You can swim in US dollars and Euros until you are very old. I am worried about sinking into the bottom before I get old. Do you mean you don't need money? My salary is enough. God! You are honest. No, I can break your leg and knock off your teeth. And then tell the god that it's because of your falling. Now it's the second part of Marleyzov Ballet This is a massacre. No, Monia, it's a new way of circumcision. New hair style, from paratroops. Where am I going after I had the haircut? Gas Chamber? Yes, yes. Fascist Who are you? Why do you regard someone as a fascist just because of his haircut? Massacre and gas chamber. Shush! Shut up! You won't get anything. He won't turn me over to you. Who? Why don't you understand, Genna? Genna. Sorkin He wanted to get rid of me three years ago when he got involved in the case. But I ran away. I was lucky at that time. But at that time I was with Chika's men, not you. I guessed that. They won't turn you over to Sorking. Nothing will get protection at anytime in Russia. Especially people. Please imagine it. You escort me back. Lock me and guard me. But there is his man in your guards too. What's the result? I can't even say "Ah". I will be killed on the first day. It's impossible. Or the second day. Stop! Are you afraid? Yes. Because I know too much, Vania. I tell you, Gena will never show up. Because of us. You know what, there were over 50 people like you ever protected me. I paid them. I can't get rid of the idea now that you are one of them, one of the fifty men. However, I, please forgive me, I am not used to treating the people I hired seriously. Take a break. And go on. What do you mean the people you hired? I can't treat them seriously. The people who protect you, they are ready to die for you. But you? Please forgive me. What, master? Please forgive me. I didn't get that, master. Please forgive me. Please loudly, master. I beg your forgiveness. This is for you. We give it to you. Three hours ago, the phone was connected. From Klemmenev, is it? There has been no news in three hours. That's it. Put the phone away. I don't understand why we always torture ourselves? It will be done if a group of Special Force is dispatched. Then we would get nothing. Nothing may be better. I think it is not as simple as we imagined But we still should figure a way out. We should use our heads more. Shut up! Speak of your heads, there is nothing there. Your department is a mess ,too The truth has not been found yet. Demetrios Alexeevich, that's because there is no truth at all. The truth is he is an excellent expert, a super expert. He was busted to captain because of the incident happened in Columbia. From special agent to ordinary investigator? He will drag him down If he isn't killed. Do you want to bet? If Klemmenev screwed it up, I will take off my epaulets. But, if If he screwed it up, you will take off yours both. Hello Can I speak to Mr. Solerdorf? -No, good bye. -Hold on. Hold on, please don't hang up Please tell Mr. Solerdorf that there is a gas leak in our house. Mr. Solerdorf, there is a psycho talking about gas leak. Gas leak? Is this your passwords? The reply is "passing through" Is it? What else? We stole a second car. It won't end well. If you want to buy some fish, you can come tomorrow. But there is only small fish, on big one. And the small fish will go together with beer. Yegor Yegor Petrovic Solerdorf You can call me Yegor Where is your big fish? Where is your troop? Did I promise you the army? This is a special secret operation. Not the Battle of Kursk. Where is the man you caught? Don't worry. l just came from Boris. To be frank, You call me over from the girls, not one, but two beautiful girls. I prefer girls and comforts rather than this kind of appointment at night. You haven't told me where is the man you caught? Do you think it is proper to ask me a favor? I also want to know where the justice is. I haven't heard any specific measures from you yet. Yes , it's me. Got it. Honey, wait a moment. I'll come back immediately. The girl is really hot. I don't want to be grumbling, but I still want to say that Love everything in our lives when we still have time. If I put it off until tomorrow, l will miss everything in my life. There is nothing but work. I think there will be much more things in the future. This is destiny. Damn it, I can't believe it. How do you find me? I'll tell you later. You have seen Boris early. Hurry up! Get on the car! How about his family and children? He doesn't have any child What did you say? He doesn't have any child. You are not sent by Boris. Hurry up! Get on the car! Who is he? Tell me! It seems like I've got a concussion. Who sent him here? We will break your finger if you don't say. You are ridiculous on every aspect. Cheap individualistic heroism Ridiculous threat, and even your walking is ridiculous. Have you ever profiled yourself? Fire! Which one? This one? That one? Or both? What's up? I can't afford it, pal. Sit here. Don't you run away, do you? Bastard! Hey, Monia, I never ask you to die. Sit here. Hold it. How are you feeling ? It's a narrow escape. I can still walk. Your spiritual master, Adolf Hitler, he is very satisfied now. I have never taken this kind of shower before. No mirror, no tissue, no comb. That's not bad. Thank you for your soap. And no line. Take a breath. I have an instinct that our hard time is going to be over. I can know your instinct as long as I glance your sandwich. Excuse me, is there a kitchen Or dining table stuff. That's it. I have remembered clearly that this is an antique, dating from the 18th century. Exactly. What did you learn from your parents? My parents have two hundred men like me. Each on can make you exhausted. Why? Is it an orphanage? I feel sympathy about your miserable childhood. Save the sympathy for yourself. I don't like to hear anything when I am having a meal. Give it to me. It's a coming age gift for my dear older brother. Remember forever that knowledge is power. From your brother, Boris. Do you have a brother? Give it back to me. Don't worry, l won't eat it. Read it. It's French, you can't understand. This is the Baudelaire's poem. How can we understand?! This is the poem about sick horse. The hot summer shines the Patwa Willing to burn everything bit by bit All the power have returned to nature All the desires have returned to nature. There is nothing activities You are suitable to pretend as a graduate from a Sport University. That's because when you praise Patwa, you are treading upon it. Genna Sorkin, I don't want to do that. The god will see even though you have locked it. How about this I give you the evidence, the telephone record Then you let me leave Ok, I give you the evidence, the telephone record And a house in Carolina And 3 million 10 million is not too much, is it? Monica Then a hundred million, Vanessa. I just wonder how do you use it? Do you want me to say? You idiot, you certainly will set up orphanage, school and old folks' home. However, you will suddenly realize, the students you cultivated in your school are not the kinds of children you are looking forward to. Then you will build a jail to put those bad guys in. At last, the jail will be more than school. Because under your regime Only few people can make old bones. Million of people won't help you either. No matter how many you get, there will be only one at last. Because you can do only one thing That's destruction. You're destroyer. Maybe you're right. Only you builders have left nothing to be destroyed. It's empty. Only you are here. Hurry up! Someone is there. Put down your gun. Turn around slowly, slowly. Hold your fire. You are Klemmenev. I am for now. Zubov sent me here Hurry up! Go to the window. The horse of Don River is really fast. We have a man called president. Darling We have agreed the price. You'd better take your Arab turn. No, your president doesn't deserve it. The horse of Don River, you don't have to pay extra. Here again the bullshit between the useless spies. Hurry up, men! Or we will be dead. How much do you want to pay more? I have no money. Then we can't make it. Come on. We have to leave now. Good idea. How? Follow me. Where are we going now? Get out of here. And then? Take car to the airport. Someone is waiting for us. We won't go there. Why? Because someone is waiting for us. What are you doing? Call the boss. Be gentle, man. Don't call Zubov. There is something wrong with his phone. Wonderful Shut up Ok, what's your suggestion? We get on the ship pretending not to know anything. We should think it again. How many people do they have? Four Two for me, and two for you. That's not right. We do not tie together. And we never have meal together. You don't trust me? No. Listen! Go with me. Why? Shut up. If I cough suddenly or do sort of stuff You jumped and ran to her. Why I should jump out? Because you are going to fall, Monia. Hey, hold your fire. Freeze! Son of a bitch. Everything is alright. I am one of you. Young man, I don't remember you. Which group are you in? Which group are you in? I am in Devil Group. I am in Sky group. I don't know about that group. How about him? I think so Idiot! Who did you kill? Someone should be killed, I think. No, we want to catch alive. And this one. Oh, damn it. I repeat "I think" "I think", just like a child. Are you deaf? No, there is a hole in my leg. Son of a bitch. I'm gonna catch their attention, and then you go to get a ship. Take him with you. Go along the Riverside Road. Meet at the first dock. Clear? Where are you heading for? The first dock What don't you stop? Look back Get away, let me drive Don't get in my way. I said that let me drive. Are you deaf, little girl? I have a name, man. I'm Nadja Nica. It's symbolic. Fortunately, they sent a beautiful little girl. Aha, here comes the backup. Girl, I think we have a lot of problem. You're right. Hey. What are they going to do? Give me a cigarette. Nadja Nica, you are the queen of the sea. Where did you learn it? In the university. We go to Yevcatrea every summer. There are racing airships and motorboats. It's very relaxing. It's just a kind of amusement. Interesting. Here come to the good use. What's your major? Law. -In Moscow, and your teacher is Tharp Loff? -Yes. How did you know? Because I'm one of his students, too. Monia, I think you have recovered. I am a vigorous man. Yes, Tharp Loff is very humorous. Can you tell me something about him? Let's have fun together. You won't understand. He is the man we both know. Oh, that's it, common acquaintance. Listen carefully, backup. I will not say it again. I try to trust you, instead of suspect you. It's not good. It's very bad. Now please listen to me. If you arrest me again, you'll wait to be shot. Guy, why do you say those aggressive words? You are wrong if you think we are laughing at you. It's simple. Nadja and I have been in the same university. Of course, in different time. We have studied with an excellent and very wise man. It's simple. We just have a past to recall together. Now the memory party is over, college guys. Now I will ask you some questions, come here. Oh, you are right, he is just so rude. What's the matter? Just come here. Look at my eyes. Who are the guys with tattoos? I have said they were the guys with Sorkin. I have reminded you. Genna can reach out very far. Everyone has tattoos, right? What's the matter on earth? He tried to kill And save you at the same time, is it reasonable? I don't understand what you are talking about. I am saying that you are lying to me. Sorkin didn't plan to kill you. You have heard by yourself that he wanted you to be live. Now, think up a reason to defend for yourself. My patient has a limit. I can't help you. Why? Bastard! Say or not? You are a bastard! You dead guy! I want to stamp you into the earth. That's all you can do, such an incapacious man. You are just. . . You are jealous. You are jealous. You are jealous. I should put a bullet through another leg. Come on, rude! Come on, what else can you do? What's happening? Why? There is nothing she planed to do. -Come on, come on, go. -To where? -Go. -No, no, no no no, no Wait, wait. No, no, please -I count to three. -No. Count to two. If you still don't want to say until two. You are going to lie with her. One, two. Wait, wait. What do you want to know? Spit it out! Who are these people? Where are they from? What's the meaning of the tattoos? -They are just tattoos. -Three. No, no. I'll tell you. Sir, it makes no difference who kills me. Say it! No, I know nothing. Fire! I don't care. I know I can get nothing from you. Why do you stand up? You know why. Good assistances lead to good results. I think you are professional. Brave man, it's not necessary to praise me. But I won't permit to treat an injured man as an animal at any time. You are not a patrol but a lawyer. You are also not in the special force. -You are sadism. -Yes, I am masochism. It's the best for you to be an astronaut or a diver. I will write in the report that you threatened and beat Sharik. And you also have a hand in at the same time. Anyway, I will write. Ok, but don't stain yourself by these words. It's unnecessary to beat about the bush. So please be straight. This kind of stupid performance It is part of our work. Please forgive me. Don't excuse yourself. -I don't need to. -Don't touch me. Ok, I don't touch you. But don't bring shame to the special force. Don't defend for yourself. It makes me sick. You are making me sick now. There is no Penicillin. Try to look for it. I said no and it's no. You should go to the drug store. I don't like our Mada Harry. It seems that you try to please her. No, we usually say yes and mean no. You are such a double-dealer. You don't understand now, Sharik has never been wrong. The girl has studied with Tharp Loff. He has great influence on others with his own personality, but not to the good side. Briefly, he is a lyricist. He slept with all beautiful girls in university. Believe me, Nadja Nica is no exception. Tharp Loff's lovers are not ordinary coquettish bitches. They are high-class ones. There is only one way to satisfy the girls like Nadja That is paying her three times as much as she received as a lover. So are your salaries high? Ok, let's turn to another topic. Do you think. . . Do you think she will sleep with you? Be honest. And be of self-insight. If such a woman comes to you, it must be for the money. Especially for such a man like you. And what about a man like you? A man like me has certain profits. I have men's merits, excuse me, and fortunes. What do you mean, Monia? She works for you. But she makes money in another place. She is a double spy. Don't move everyone! Don't move. Where is the anesthetic? In the safe. Keys. Quickly! Monia What? Hands Give them to me. Didn't you ask me why Sorkin let me alive? Couldn't you guess that because I have his secret documents, The state security guards want to make sure whether I have those documents or not. Nadja Nica comes for this. -Boy, can we go together? -Ok if you work here. Hey, you two stay, and also the one next to you. That self-dramatizing guy. Yes. Really? Yes. I think the two are better than the puppet. Are you silly? You take along by yourself. Let me try. You sit still. High-class. Yes? En. . . I like it. Oh, I like it so much. The real whore has a queen-like appearance. You got the point. You like to take revenge just like me. Penicillin, please give me a box of injection, thank you. Who did you kill again? I hope it's not a pharmacist. Go on, or fake it. I've told you that she comes for those documents. You will believe this soon. She will ask you about them herself. And you, I beg you to pretend knowing something, but tell her later. In this way we can live for another three days. Really? Why not three weeks? Nadja Nica will soon understand that we try to fool her. Then she will arrest us and torture us. That's great, you will be chopped, and l will know where the documents are in the end. Those damn documents. That's funny. It finally arises your thirst for knowledge. You are really dull,aren'you? what's your constellation Aries or Capricornus? I bet that you like cruel and exciting music, don't you? What? You are wrong. I don't like music at all. I am lack of melody-differentiating ability. No, I like one song, about the white pyramid. about eternal peace. Good song. Everything is an illusion. Nadja Nica, we have been waiting for you all along. It's my first time to do this. But you did it well. Don't you want to drink? No, I don't, especially now. What about you, Mikhanil? Dilute Penicillin with wine, no, no. Are you also like this at other times? At other times, you should go to have a bath. You smell just like the foot-wrappings used for a week. Keep your eyes on this man. Clear. Sir, just relax For a well cultured Jew with injuries, what is he able do? Please do everything you want. Sit. -You know, I . . . -Don't speak. Now we have a talk. You have the documents. Let's make a deal. You give me the documents, and I give you the freedom. What did l say? I said who you worked for? For an important person. I hope you didn't work for Genna Sorkin. Just the opposite. What about this guy? What's the matter? I'm very cold. I want to have a warm.. What? Why? Don't think of anything I'm just very cold. I have been alone without a man for a long time. I have noticed you in Namibian before. It's not my style if I can't have you. Especially that you are my type. Hello, this is Room 1520. I sent them to dry cleaning yesterday. What? How can you take them away? Bitch! Got it. What's this? What? It's for father For father. Come here, are you mad? Do you think that the money I give you can buy the whole store? We take a limousine and live in our friend's house. They are all upper class. But you are just like a straw man. I told you to put on your clothes but not... Listen, l am with you, but you bring trouble to me one after another. If something unpleasant happens today I will ask you to serve some psychos. Understand? I say you understand? Bitch! Mr. Fusca, nice to meet you. Good morning, Mr. Gafut. I want to check my safe. Ok, follow me please. I'm sorry, Miss. You have to wait here. I won't let you go alone. Nadja Nica, fingerprint is a must to enter the basement. You should believe me. No. What's wrong with you Nadja Nica? If I were you, I would be very happy now. Look at yourself. With beautiful clothes and watch, you look very nice. It's all because of me. If you make the correct choice, it will be better. -You can also get good payment from your boss. -Mr. Fusca. Please wait. How about that? I will go. Think it over. There is the basement, with impermeable walls. Make your decision now. I enter, and ten minutes later, Sorkin's secrete documents are yours. You will get nothing if I stand still here. I think you are not only beautiful but also clever. You said Tharp Loff was your teacher. You didn't learn much from him. What else do you want to say? En, nothing. Let's go. Stop. Alright. I think you've made a correct choice. Very quickly. The phone in the office can't get through. Please enter password. -Hello. -It's me, Klemmenev. What's the matter, young man? How is it going? I've been waiting for a whole night. Where are you? Demirtry?Alexevyeich Who did you send to look for me? Canalin Orlova ran away with the man who should be arrested. What are you saying, boy? I don't know Orlova. But who told her the codes? Just in case, check your phone. Hello. Miss, please come here to pick up the phone. -Hello. -It's me, Nadja Nica. You lied to me. You've never studied with Tharp Loff. You are not his student. You won't let me go. What are you doing?You hurt me. -I command you to stop. -it's a command. Who sent you here, you bitch? -Who do you work for? -Locke Toff Oh, didn't you say Zubov send you here, did you? You've made a big lie. Zobuv konws nothing. Locke Toff sent me here to let you. . . Beast! If you die in a sudden, I will continue to finish the assignment. There is no time to check your words. It seems like we are really going to die. Where is Sharik? I don't know. I can ask in another way. -Don't expect I will be soft because you're a woman. -Sharik ran away. He went to the basement with the manager. The manager went out, but he didn't. You said the manager? Here is the guest. Mr. Klemmenev, I'm Haniz. Welcome to Malta branch of our bank. What do you want to contribute for us? I need a safe to keep cash. Follow me please, sir. Thank you. He is in.

Oh, I'm sorry to interrupt. Are you Mr. Kremnyov? Someone left a letter for you. -Yes, I am. Thank you. -You're welcome. Thanks. Hello, Yegor. I know you are here in Paris occasionally. Can you imagine how did I know? I got the information during a chase. Seriously, I have a lot to talk with you. I will fly to Marseilles in two hours. I will stay there for one day, and then go to tropical countries by boat. I won't stay long there. God knows when this can be over. I have a few hours with you. Of course, if you can arrive there on time. Palacupa Restaurant's card is on the envelope. I'm waiting for you there. This will be a serious talk. So followers aren't needed. -Sir. -Thank you. Arrange the followers. Can I have an omelette? No. Give me this one, Golden Halmet. Good choice, Sir. I have never tried Golden Halmet in my whole life. It's a serious negligence. But who can ever eat such luxurious breakfast? Why don't you ask how am I going recently? I think you are fine. I'm very happy that I met you before. You looks quite good in the suit. Expecting a date. I will try my best to write the letter for you as good as for her. But you know that I understand delicate emotions deeply, and I'm also full of imagination. Are you sure to write in your style? It really needs some time. I don't believe that lady will come. Is it OK? I talk about myself. Now I use another name. I live far away from here, farther than the place you come from to find me. I'm fine. Actually, you know the dream is broken. You don't smoke, do you? Put your hands on the table. Or, our hunters will be angry. I also learnt something from you. What do you want to do? I don't like to be in debt. I said that if you let me live, I will satisfy you. This is for you, I promised. What's this? A house in Kalari. Take it back. Formalities are legal. All is legal. Sign it and it's yours. She can't live in the board with you, can she? Yes? Happiness is a step away from you. I don't have much time. Bye, Kremnyov. This time is the last time. I owed you in the past. But now, you owe me. I owe you nothing. You owe me. I think so.
